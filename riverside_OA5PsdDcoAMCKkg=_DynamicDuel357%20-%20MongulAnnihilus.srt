This is a Dynamike Network podcast. Hey everyone,
Marvelous Joe here at the top of the episode.

2
00:00:06,553 --> 00:00:12,037
With the approaching holiday season, we're officially
kicking off this year's holiday charity drive

3
00:00:12,197 --> 00:00:17,681
in lead up to our charity dual episode in December,
which is gonna be Alfred Pennyworth versus

4
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:23,665
Edwin Jarvis. This year, all donations will
be going once again to Pop Culture Classroom,

5
00:00:24,085 --> 00:00:28,989
a nonprofit organization that delivers high
quality, all inclusive educational resources

6
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:34,652
to school districts. teachers, and community
organizations using comics, graphic novels,

7
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:40,115
and related pop culture media. Their mission
is to inspire a love of learning, increase

8
00:00:40,175 --> 00:00:46,038
literacy, celebrate diversity, and build community
through the tools of pop culture and the power

9
00:00:46,098 --> 00:00:52,102
of self-expression. To donate to this wonderful
charity, visit our official store through dynamicduel.com

10
00:00:52,722 --> 00:00:58,545
where you'll find two donation options. One

11
00:00:59,186 --> 00:01:06,132

donate DC, one word, or dynamicduel.com slash

12
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:11,637

We're making the charity drive a competitive

13
00:01:11,677 --> 00:01:17,583
duel this year, except that the only stat is
which side can donate the most. Everyone who

14
00:01:17,623 --> 00:01:23,168
donates will receive a digital poster featuring
original art of Alfred and Jarvis that's inspired

15
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:28,605
by New Yorker cartoons. One lucky random donor
will win a framed print of the Alfred vs Jarvis

16
00:01:28,745 --> 00:01:33,349
art that we'll announce during that December
duel episode. Which fanbase will be the most

17
00:01:33,389 --> 00:01:37,773
charitable? We'll keep everyone posted as to
which team is winning as donations come in

18
00:01:38,093 --> 00:01:43,017
during these upcoming episodes. Thanks to everyone
who donates, and on with the show!

19
00:02:03,958 --> 00:02:09,581
Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we
review superhero films and debate the superiority

20
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:15,344
between Marvel and DC by comparing their characters
in stat-based battle simulations. I'm Johnny

21
00:02:15,364 --> 00:02:21,467
DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous Joe.
And in this episode, we are going to pit the

22
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:28,831
DC villain of Mongol against the Marvel villain,
Annihilus. They're both intergalactic tyrants,

23
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:34,414
and we thought it would be a good matchup in
lead up to our review of the Marvels. Right,

24
00:02:34,454 --> 00:02:39,815
yeah, Captain Marvel is a cosmic level hero,
so we're doing a duel with cosmic level bad

25
00:02:39,855 --> 00:02:44,177
guys. Both of these characters are pretty interesting,
so I can't wait to tell you all about them

26
00:02:44,217 --> 00:02:48,278
later on in this episode. Before that, we're
going to break down the comic book movie news

27
00:02:48,298 --> 00:02:55,581
from the past week, of which there was one major
news item, and that was the first Echo official

28
00:02:55,621 --> 00:03:00,555
trailer for the upcoming Disney Plus series.
As always, we list our segment times in our

29
00:03:00,595 --> 00:03:04,199
episode description, so feel free to check out
the show notes if you want to skip ahead to

30
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:09,223
a particular topic. As our listeners may know,
our duel simulator is so advanced that it's

31
00:03:09,263 --> 00:03:14,829
gained sentience, and has named itself the Artificial
Lifeform for Running Extensive Duels, just

32
00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:22,256
a rather very intelligent simulator, 9000, or
Alfred Jarvis 9000. He has a quick message

33
00:03:22,276 --> 00:03:29,209

But with that out of the way, quick! to the

50
00:05:12,638 --> 00:05:19,384
No Prize! A No Prize is an award Marvel used
to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic

51
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:24,669
Dual No Prize, is a digital award we post on
Instagram and in our email newsletter for the

52
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:29,233
person that we feel gave the best answer to
our question of the week. For last week we

53
00:05:29,373 --> 00:05:35,638
asked, what was your favorite Netflix Marvel
television series and why? And this was coming

54
00:05:35,698 --> 00:05:41,001
off the news that the Daredevil born again series
has got a showrunner in Dario Scartapane who

55
00:05:41,061 --> 00:05:46,384
was a writer on the Punisher Netflix series.
Yeah, it was pretty exciting news. We got quite

56
00:05:46,404 --> 00:05:50,446
a few answers. So we'll break down all of the
honorable mentions before revealing this week's

57
00:05:50,486 --> 00:05:56,970
no prize winner. Our first honorable mention
goes to Travis Herndon, who said, Hey guys,

58
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,153
Travis here. So my pick would have to be the
defenders. I think that show was a pretty good

59
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:09,160
series. kind of Avengers like having all the
street level heroes team up together to fight

60
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,843
a common foe. Oh, it makes me really hope that
maybe we might get another season or maybe

61
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:19,947
bring the defenders into the main MCU. So my
pick would definitely be defenders. Yeah. Great

62
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:24,189
answer, Travis. I actually really like the defenders.
For some reason it gets a lot of shit from

63
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:30,152
a lot of people, I think because Iron Fist wasn't
that smart in the series and there were some

64
00:06:30,192 --> 00:06:35,495
plot elements like with the the dragons underneath
New York City and stuff that were kind of stupid.

65
00:06:35,935 --> 00:06:41,658
But I really love the interactions between all
four of the defenders characters, including

66
00:06:41,758 --> 00:06:46,720
Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage and Iron
Fist. It was the best part of the show and

67
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,681
it kind of felt the most comic booky out of
all of the Marvel Netflix series. So I can

68
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:57,564
totally see why this could be somebody's favorite.
I mean, for me, the defenders was my second

69
00:06:57,804 --> 00:07:02,899
least favorite Netflix Marvel series. mostly
because I think I had a villain problem, but

70
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:07,160
I can't deny the fact that it was cool to see
all the characters from these other shows that

71
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,682
we were watching come together, just like the
Avengers movie, you know, it had that same

72
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:17,845
appeal. For sure, yeah. I hope the Disney Plus
series carries forward the Defenders concept

73
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:21,647
in some way, shape or form for that platform.
Yeah, it would be really cool if they brought

74
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:26,829
back the actors for Luke Cage and Jessica Jones
specifically. And the Punisher. And Electra.

75
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:33,554
Just fucking everybody but Iron Fist. Our next
honorable mention goes to Anson Millard, who

76
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:40,760
said, Hey, it's Anson Millard. My favorite Marvel
Netflix show was Luke Cage. I feel like that

77
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:48,006
is the underdog pick for this. So Luke Cage,
I feel like had the best action scenes from

78
00:07:48,046 --> 00:07:54,872
the standpoint of just having one overpowered
guy go against entire mobs of people. I also

79
00:07:54,912 --> 00:07:59,227
love the music in there, bulletproof love. It
was awesome. It's cool that Method Man showed

80
00:07:59,307 --> 00:08:05,012
up and just great villains, great show. Oh,
for sure. There was a lot to love about the

81
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:10,076
Luke Cage television series, especially season
two, which I was a big fan of. But Luke Cage

82
00:08:10,096 --> 00:08:14,439
brought so many unique things to the table,
including the music. The action was really

83
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:19,703
awesome, although you kind of wonder why bad
guys even bother to bring guns to their fights

84
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:26,627
anymore, you know. And for like the Iron Fist
series, you wondered why nobody brought guns

85
00:08:26,747 --> 00:08:30,929
to those fights. They were all martial artists.
But yeah, it was a great series and my culture

86
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:36,051
was just phenomenal in the role. It is an absolute
tragedy that story was not able to continue

87
00:08:36,071 --> 00:08:40,993
into a season 3. Like I'm still dying to learn
what happened afterward. Right, yeah that was

88
00:08:41,013 --> 00:08:46,576
a great cliffhanger ending for season 2. It
was so godfather! It was so good! Our next

89
00:08:46,616 --> 00:08:52,307
honorable mention goes to Lizzie Dyer Arnie,
who said... Hey, it's Lizzie. 100%, I have

90
00:08:52,327 --> 00:08:57,951
to say, my favorite Marvel Netflix show was
Daredevil. Seasons one and three were definitely

91
00:08:57,991 --> 00:09:02,454
pure perfection. Season two wasn't as good with
the Defenders crossover, didn't like that.

92
00:09:03,014 --> 00:09:08,418
But I mean, you have Matt Murdock. He's a blind
lawyer. He's got elevated super senses and

93
00:09:08,438 --> 00:09:13,521
he's defending Hill's Kitchen. You got Marcy,
Foggy, Karen. They're the best side characters

94
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:18,044
you can ask for. If they're not in the new Disney
version, I'm really not interested. Yeah, this

95
00:09:18,085 --> 00:09:21,566
is kind of the obvious answer, right? the common
answer, at least two other people gave the

96
00:09:21,646 --> 00:09:27,088
answer of Daredevil because it was phenomenal.
And hopefully Disney Plus can carry forward

97
00:09:27,188 --> 00:09:32,809
that greatness as much as they can with their
upcoming Born Again series. It sounds like

98
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:37,851
Disney is trying to recapture some of that previous
magic. Except of course when it comes to the

99
00:09:37,871 --> 00:09:42,992
supporting cast, right? Because Karen and Foggy
are not returning and that's really a shame

100
00:09:43,032 --> 00:09:48,426
because a big part of you know any superhero
is his supporting cast. for them to not be

101
00:09:48,526 --> 00:09:53,727
in the upcoming Born Again series is really
a shame, especially since the series seems

102
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:59,429
at least to have been going heavily down the
road of a courtroom drama, and for Matt to

103
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:04,910
not have his firm partner there with him in
Foggy Nelson, it's kind of a shame. Well, I

104
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:09,652
heard the whole reason they're not going with
those actors specifically was because if they

105
00:10:09,752 --> 00:10:15,853
did, they would need to pay the old Netflix
Daredevil show writers like some sort of creative

106
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:20,339
residuals. and they don't want to do that. That's
super lame. They're Disney. They have all the

107
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:26,060
money in the world. They should do it. I just
think they really hate Netflix. But oh, great

108
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,282
answer Lizzie, Nate Mantineo and Abner O'Tary
worthy to others who gave the answer of Daredevil

109
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:35,323
as well. So thanks to everyone who took the
time to visit our website and record an answer.

110
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:43,158
But the winner of this week's no prize is Braden
Johnston who said, hey, Braden J here. New

111
00:10:43,178 --> 00:10:48,319
to the podcast, I've been loving every second
of it, but I'd say my favorite Marvel Netflix

112
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:53,540
series would have to be The Punisher. I discovered
it a few years ago, right after I had my daughter,

113
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:58,922
and so Frank's story really kinda hit home with
me there. And especially getting into season

114
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:04,643
two, that's where everything got amplified for
me. Just the story, the emotional beats, the

115
00:11:04,743 --> 00:11:10,485
action, and everything just got way better after
that. I do feel that since the Punisher Netflix

116
00:11:10,525 --> 00:11:15,219
series came out later, than the other shows,
like after The Defenders aired and everything

117
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:20,722
like that, the Punisher was often overlooked,
I think, both seasons. But I think that's really

118
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:25,705
a shame because both seasons were really well
done. I think Jon Bernthal was an incredible

119
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:31,188
Punisher and it's nice to see that there are
people out there that appreciate the show as

120
00:11:31,228 --> 00:11:36,391
much as I do. It brought so much nuance to the
character of Frank Castle that I think a lot

121
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:40,373
of other adaptations, they kind of wrote him
off as like this really one note character,

122
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:46,899
but. to really explore the depth of the Punisher
is to make them so much more interesting. And

123
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:52,681
I think that was the true strength of the Punisher
Netflix television series. Absolutely, yeah,

124
00:11:52,701 --> 00:11:56,662
I loved this series both seasons. I don't know
if we're gonna get another Punisher series

125
00:11:56,702 --> 00:12:01,304
for Disney Plus, like we're doing for Daredevil,
but the Punisher was supposed to appear in

126
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:06,585
the Daredevil Born Again series, and we'll see
if the creative reboot changes that. I hope

127
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:10,787
it doesn't. Yeah, that would be a shame if we
lost the chance to see Jon Bernthal in the

128
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:14,649
role again. But great answer, Brayden Johnston,
you're the winner of this week's No Prize.

129
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:19,331
If you the listener want a shot at winning your
own No Prize, stay tuned to later on this episode

130
00:12:19,371 --> 00:12:24,833
when we'll be asking another Question of the
Week. And now that that's done, on to the news!

131
00:12:30,446 --> 00:12:35,908
This past week we got the first official trailer
for the Echo television series that's going

132
00:12:35,928 --> 00:12:40,830
to come out on Disney Plus. Later on next year,
we thought maybe the show was going to come

133
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:46,532
out in November of this year but it's actually
coming out January 10th on Disney Plus and

134
00:12:46,972 --> 00:12:53,995
on Hulu. The overall tone of the trailer surprised
me. I don't know what I was expecting. Honestly,

135
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:58,417
I was not expecting much from this Echo television
series but the best thing that I could say

136
00:12:58,457 --> 00:13:04,199
about it is... that it really seems to be carrying
forward the vibe that was set in the Daredevil

137
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:07,961
Netflix series. I was really impressed with
what we saw here. I'm really hoping that the

138
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:11,983
trailer doesn't end up better than the show
itself, but at the very least, the trailer

139
00:13:12,003 --> 00:13:18,025
got me hyped, which is what it's supposed to
do. I was also shocked by this trailer. This

140
00:13:18,425 --> 00:13:23,827
show went from the bottom of my list to what
I'm interested in watching to the top for Marvel.

141
00:13:24,288 --> 00:13:28,589
Yeah, I mean, because Echo wasn't all that compelling
in the Hawkeye television series, right? Right.

142
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:33,648
but to really explore her past with the Kingpin,
and you know, honestly, just to have the Kingpin

143
00:13:33,668 --> 00:13:42,111
back, Vincent DiNardfeo's portrayal of the character
is so freaking impactful. Literally, you see

144
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:48,134
him just like, pounding this dude into the dumpster,
into the pavement in this trailer. It really

145
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:52,676
seems to be setting a new tone for what we get
from Marvel Studios and the maturity level,

146
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:57,778
and of course again, the tone. Yeah, absolutely.
I mean, I've been knocking the Kingpin. as

147
00:13:57,798 --> 00:14:01,841
part of the MCU ever since we saw him in Hawkeye
because I thought Disney really screwed the

148
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:08,546
character over. But this trailer makes up for
all of that. I recant my blasphemy. He is amazing

149
00:14:08,606 --> 00:14:14,150
as the character. Yo, on Hawkeye, he was a little
bit cartoony, right? Right. But that was just

150
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:18,113
kind of the vibe of the show. But here, the
vibe is much more keeping with the character

151
00:14:18,253 --> 00:14:23,797
as we know him from previous seasons. And regarding
the whole vibe, it seems like Marvel is introducing

152
00:14:23,857 --> 00:14:30,134
a new brand. for these type of character-driven,
grounded stories, that's gonna be called Marvel

153
00:14:30,334 --> 00:14:35,738
Spotlight, which was the name of a comic book
title that Marvel used to produce to introduce

154
00:14:35,778 --> 00:14:40,963
new characters or put a spotlight on lesser-known
characters within the comics. Yeah, this will

155
00:14:40,983 --> 00:14:46,567
be Marvel Studios' first sub banner, which is
interesting, that it would debut with something

156
00:14:46,627 --> 00:14:51,892
like Echo. Right, we've seen Marvel have a sub
banner before when it comes to film productions,

157
00:14:52,072 --> 00:14:56,743
like with Punisher Warzone. and Ghost Rider
Spirit of Vengeance, those were under the Marvel

158
00:14:56,803 --> 00:15:02,025
Knights banner. But that was abandoned. Usually
those productions were other studios. But now

159
00:15:02,065 --> 00:15:05,866
that Marvel owns everything except for, you
know, Spider-Man, they've created their own

160
00:15:05,926 --> 00:15:09,508
sub-brand in Marvel Spotlight, which I think
is pretty interesting. I don't know if it's

161
00:15:09,548 --> 00:15:15,290
entirely necessary. Do you think it means that
Echo is not in the MCU? No, I just think people

162
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:19,872
don't have to worry about whether it is going
to be or not. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.

163
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:24,646
Like it's not going to connect to any larger
story. It's just an interesting standalone

164
00:15:24,686 --> 00:15:31,909
story. At the very least, I think it'll keep
this trend that we have among fans to try to

165
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:38,552
spot Easter eggs and connections to the larger
saga that's going on currently, the multiversal

166
00:15:38,572 --> 00:15:43,894
saga or other television shows and stuff like
that. I think it just allows fans to just focus

167
00:15:44,014 --> 00:15:49,376
on the story as kind of a standalone thing as
opposed to dissecting it to death. And thank

168
00:15:49,437 --> 00:15:57,902
goodness, Oh look, Mephisto confirmed shit.
Yeah, break from that kind of over analysis

169
00:15:58,062 --> 00:16:03,125
is something that I think would extremely benefit
the MCU as a whole. But regarding the trailer,

170
00:16:03,265 --> 00:16:09,169
you know, it starts off with young Echo, Maya
Lopez, trying to order an ice cream from an

171
00:16:09,249 --> 00:16:14,573
ice cream cart and the vendor is being a dick
to her because she's not able to speak given

172
00:16:14,593 --> 00:16:19,036
that she's deaf. For his slight against this
little girl, Kingpin beats the shit out of

173
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:25,921
him. Maybe to death? We know that in the comics
and in the MCU continuity, Kingpin basically

174
00:16:25,981 --> 00:16:32,266
raises this little girl as if she were his own
and he loves her. He sees a lot of himself

175
00:16:32,487 --> 00:16:37,571
in Maya. I really love the effect they gave
for all of the impacts throughout this entire

176
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:44,377
trailer of like echoes. Like when the Kingpin
hits the guy selling the ice cream, the sound

177
00:16:44,437 --> 00:16:49,341
of his punch repeats itself. Right, yeah, and
it actually transforms during the course of

178
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:53,558
the trailer. into more of a Native American
chant toward the end. I don't know if you caught

179
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:57,039
that, but that was pretty interesting. One of
the things I learned about the show is that

180
00:16:57,579 --> 00:17:02,921
Echo is not gonna have the traditional powers
that she has from the comics in this show.

181
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:08,963
So if you listen to our question versus Echo
episode that we've done on this podcast, you'll

182
00:17:08,983 --> 00:17:12,924
learn all about the backstory of Echo and what
her actual powers are, which are kind of like

183
00:17:12,944 --> 00:17:19,565
Taskmaster. She's able to view a physical action
and then recreate it through her experienced

184
00:17:20,034 --> 00:17:24,676
physical training. Now, do you think that's
because of Taskmaster and how we've already

185
00:17:24,756 --> 00:17:29,479
seen her in the MCU in the Black Widow movie?
Yeah, I think it's possible that since Echo

186
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:35,282
and Taskmaster have almost the same powers that
the MCU would want to differentiate that. I

187
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:40,726
guess the abilities that Echo is going to have
in this show derive from her Native American

188
00:17:40,906 --> 00:17:45,628
heritage, specifically the Choctaw tribe. I
think I'm pronouncing that right. And she basically

189
00:17:45,688 --> 00:17:50,531
calls upon the spirits of her ancestors. which
give her certain abilities. Which is interesting,

190
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:54,873
I don't know, I understand why they may be changing
their powers. Honestly, I don't love that.

191
00:17:54,953 --> 00:17:59,815
I'm kind of okay with Taskmaster and Echo having
similar abilities. There is a tendency though,

192
00:18:00,155 --> 00:18:06,878
I find, for ethnically diverse characters to
draw their powers from their heritage, which

193
00:18:06,938 --> 00:18:10,780
I don't think is always necessary. I think that's
overdone. I think it's far more interesting

194
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,462
for them to just have powers and not go too
overboard. Because honestly, okay. So I'm all

195
00:18:15,482 --> 00:18:20,643
for inclusion. I'm the biggest proponent of
diversity in comics and television shows and

196
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:26,725
film, but transforming Echo's powers to be more
cultural like this is almost like changing

197
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:31,526
Daredevil's radar sense to be like the sight
of God or something because he's Catholic,

198
00:18:31,886 --> 00:18:37,228
right? You don't always have to tie in the powers
into the character's identity. Sometimes it's

199
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:41,209
better just for the characters to have identity
and then deal with their own powers. Like Blue

200
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:46,554
Beetle, look at Blue Beetle. His Khajiitah scarab.
actually has nothing to do with his Mexican

201
00:18:46,594 --> 00:18:51,235
heritage, but he's still a fascinating character.
Look at a character like Wolverine or a lot

202
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:56,177
of the X-Men actually, like Storm, Banshee,
all of these characters that are not so boxed

203
00:18:56,277 --> 00:19:01,759
in with their abilities. Yeah, I mean, I agree
with what you've said, but I also don't mind

204
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:06,220
the Native American heritage thing. As long
as it's something I've never seen before, I

205
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,161
think I'm interested. If she did have the same
powers as Taskmaster, I'd be like, oh, redundant

206
00:19:11,181 --> 00:19:14,663
character. You know, and I don't want Echo to
be a redundant character. That's a great point.

207
00:19:14,803 --> 00:19:19,246
I mean, you are also coming from the perspective
of someone who's not really an Echo fan or

208
00:19:19,306 --> 00:19:23,728
read any of the Echo comics. Exactly. So you
probably don't give a shit if they change her

209
00:19:24,168 --> 00:19:28,931
too drastically like that. But all that being
said, you're right. If they do it well enough,

210
00:19:29,331 --> 00:19:34,314
it could be fascinating and it could be really
cool to see and a great way to include Native

211
00:19:34,354 --> 00:19:39,397
American cultural aspects. Right. Yeah. And
I'm not sure about what all of her different

212
00:19:39,417 --> 00:19:44,508
powers are going to be. but it does look like
she has the power to kick ass, which is all

213
00:19:44,568 --> 00:19:48,411
I need from the show, really. It was like way
more hardcore than I thought it was going to

214
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:52,314
be. Oh, it looks super violent. Yeah, you see
people getting straight up shot in the face

215
00:19:52,454 --> 00:19:57,578
in this trailer, which I was not expecting.
One thing I wanted to touch on though, is that

216
00:19:57,598 --> 00:20:03,362
they did reveal what Echo's superhero costume
looks like online. Oh, I did not see that.

217
00:20:03,822 --> 00:20:07,925
Yeah, they revealed it at a Q&A session that
they did at the Chalk.Nation's annual Powwow

218
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:12,187
event. where they screen the first two episodes
of the show. It looks very much like, you know,

219
00:20:12,367 --> 00:20:17,868
traditional Native American garb updated for
a modern era, kind of like what they did with

220
00:20:17,948 --> 00:20:23,390
traditional African garb in the Black Panther
movie, how it was brought into the modern era.

221
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:28,911
Looks pretty cool. Oh, interesting. Honestly,
I would have just settled for the white poem

222
00:20:28,951 --> 00:20:33,633
on the face, but this works too. It's a little
bit more colorful than I thought it would be,

223
00:20:33,953 --> 00:20:39,432
especially given that the character of... Echo's
costume in the comics is mostly black and white,

224
00:20:39,672 --> 00:20:45,957
you know? Right. We got the ever so slightest,
briefest of shots of Daredevil in this trailer.

225
00:20:46,097 --> 00:20:50,220
It was kind of like a blink and you'll miss
it type thing, but it looked incredible. He's

226
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,923
like diving across this room or something like
that. And yeah, it looks fantastic. I can't

227
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:59,967
wait to see Daredevil in the show. But more
importantly than that, I love that they didn't

228
00:21:00,007 --> 00:21:05,094
make that Daredevil cameo the highlight of this
trailer. They kept the focus. on the relationship

229
00:21:05,414 --> 00:21:10,476
between Echo and Kingpin. And I think that's
where it needs to stay. I did blink and miss

230
00:21:10,536 --> 00:21:15,218
it because I had no idea Daredevil was in the
trailer. Is he wearing his yellow suit or his

231
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:20,601
red suit? It's like black. It's really dark
in the room. It's hard to tell. Huh? Well,

232
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:24,002
it looks like I'm going to have to frame by
frame this shit now. Oh, yeah. Look at that.

233
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:29,945
Eh. What do you mean? Eh. Piece of shit. You
know, it's fucking awesome. I'll need to see

234
00:21:29,985 --> 00:21:35,294
more. I can't wait to see more. Yeah. and we'll
see more on January 10th. It's only five episodes

235
00:21:35,314 --> 00:21:39,862
that are all dropping at once, so we'll be reviewing
the show the following Tuesday. But speaking

236
00:21:39,902 --> 00:21:44,028
of the Echo series and the Marvel Spotlight
banner, that brings us to our question of the

237
00:21:44,048 --> 00:21:44,269
week.

238
00:21:48,866 --> 00:21:55,071
Which not currently existing MCU character would
you like to see get their own mini series under

239
00:21:55,091 --> 00:22:01,215
the Marvel Spotlight banner and why? Yeah, and
again, this has to be specifically a character

240
00:22:01,235 --> 00:22:06,880
that we have not seen under a Marvel Studios
film or television series. Yeah, and we'll

241
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:11,424
include the Netflix characters in that too,
so none of the defenders or Punisher. Record

247
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:45,255
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode. Now let's move on to the main

248
00:22:45,295 --> 00:22:52,007
event where we find out who will win in a matchup
between the villain characters of Mongol and

249
00:22:52,388 --> 00:22:53,049
Annihilus.

250
00:23:08,202 --> 00:23:13,564
Okay, Mongul versus Annihilus. As we mentioned
earlier in the episode, both of these characters

251
00:23:13,905 --> 00:23:20,028
are tyrannical, intergalactic villains. Mongul
is primarily a Superman and Green Lantern villain,

252
00:23:20,308 --> 00:23:25,111
although he's gone up against other superheroes
before. Annihilus, if I'm not mistaken, is

253
00:23:25,151 --> 00:23:31,434
primarily a Fantastic Four villain. Correct.
Yes, although he's posed quite the thorn in

254
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:36,197
the side of all of Marvel's cosmic level heroes,
including the Guardians of the Galaxy, Silver

255
00:23:36,237 --> 00:23:41,087
Surfer, Nova, and whatnot. Right. I don't know
much about him other than that he's pretty

256
00:23:41,147 --> 00:23:45,530
powerful. So I'm actually looking forward to
learning more about him. Really? Well, I'm

257
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:50,013
not looking forward to learning about Mongol
because he's DC and I don't give a shit. Well,

258
00:23:50,033 --> 00:23:57,018
that's your fucking mistake is Mongols dope.
He's really cool. You'll see. I mean, he wasn't

259
00:23:57,058 --> 00:24:03,383
that dope in the recent Warworld movie, the
animated one. He was kind of that's lame. Yeah,

260
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:07,565
that's he was actually really lame. He was done
much better in the Justice League cartoon.

261
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:12,437
And at least he has fucking been on the screen.
We have yet to see anything about Annihilus,

262
00:24:12,597 --> 00:24:17,421
pretty sure. Annihilus has been in a cartoon,
I'm fairly certain. Well, it was shitty then,

263
00:24:17,461 --> 00:24:22,886
because no one knows about it. To explain the
methodology behind your duels, let's go to

264
00:24:22,906 --> 00:24:29,051
our sentient dual simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000.
AJ9K, tell our listeners how you go about determining

265
00:24:29,131 --> 00:24:34,062
a winner in our dual matchups. Yes, of course,
sir. The way I determine a winner between the

266
00:24:34,102 --> 00:24:40,144
contestants is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations
using the characters statistics. A Monte Carlo

267
00:24:40,184 --> 00:24:44,465
simulation is a probabilistic model used to
determine outcomes through random sampling.

268
00:24:44,905 --> 00:24:49,806
In this case, I randomise the statistics along
a normal distribution as a way to simulate

269
00:24:49,826 --> 00:24:54,407
the many variables that can occur during battle.
The stat parameters are based on the official

270
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:58,569
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters
statistics are extrapolated.

271
00:25:02,018 --> 00:25:07,123
damage potential, versatility and perception
in order to create a more detailed and accurate

272
00:25:07,163 --> 00:25:12,569
simulation. The results of the 1000 simulations
provide a percentage of wins for each character.

273
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:17,595
The contestant with the higher percentage is
declared the victor as they have a higher probability

274
00:25:17,635 --> 00:25:23,401
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,
neither character should win 100% of the matches.

275
00:25:23,938 --> 00:25:28,440
The comic book stories have shown that there's
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so

276
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,342
the confidence rate of my method falls in line
with the precedents that have been established

277
00:25:32,362 --> 00:25:37,925
in the source material. My mathematical simulations
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are

278
00:25:37,965 --> 00:25:42,368
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes
tabulated for determination of the winner.

279
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:48,831
Thanks AJ9K! Before we run the simulations though,
we like to break down each character's histories

280
00:25:48,851 --> 00:25:54,374
and abilities before improvising a scenario
on how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations

281
00:25:54,394 --> 00:25:59,056
would play out B for B. And I believe it's my
turn to go first with the Marvel character,

282
00:25:59,096 --> 00:26:06,219
so let me go ahead and tell you all about Annihilus.
Many millennia ago, in the antimatter universe

283
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:12,301
known as the Negative Zone, a technologically
advanced species known as the Tianans traveled

284
00:26:12,342 --> 00:26:18,404
throughout the dimension seeding life spores
across barren planets. A freak meteor collision

285
00:26:18,464 --> 00:26:24,066
forced one of the Tianan spore ships to crash
onto a planet Arthros, where the crew died.

286
00:26:24,686 --> 00:26:31,508
One of those spores evolved prematurely into
a small insectoid creature. Remarkably intelligent,

287
00:26:31,788 --> 00:26:36,889
the creature struggled to survive, becoming
convinced that everything wanted to kill it

288
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:42,531
and that it must kill to survive. Eventually
the creature discovered the Tionan Starship

289
00:26:42,951 --> 00:26:48,573
and learned how to use their advanced technology.
Over time, the creature grew in size and strength,

290
00:26:48,913 --> 00:26:54,988
intent on eradicating any threat to its existence.
From the starship's warp drive, the insectoid

291
00:26:55,088 --> 00:27:01,294
built the perfect weapon, the Cosmic Control
Rod, and from the remaining life spores, developed

292
00:27:01,334 --> 00:27:06,718
an army of other insectoid creatures called
the Scavengers. He developed armor for himself,

293
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:13,144
becoming a paranoid death spot known as Annihilus,
ravaging neighboring planets just to protect

294
00:27:13,184 --> 00:27:18,029
himself from the potential danger they could
pose to him. For Annihilus feared only one

295
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:23,413
thing, death. After developing a reputation
as one of the Negative Zone's most fearsome

296
00:27:23,513 --> 00:27:28,877
and powerful Warlords, Annihilus encountered
the Fantastic Four for the first time. The

297
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:34,222
superhero team had traveled into the Negative
Zone when Mr. Fantastic detected the Cosmic

298
00:27:34,262 --> 00:27:40,387
Control Rod as a source of anti-particles, which
they needed to treat invisible woman who was

299
00:27:40,427 --> 00:27:46,532
having cosmic ray-related complications with
her pregnancy at the time. The team stole Annihilus'

300
00:27:46,572 --> 00:27:52,264
weapon and escaped his wrath. though they returned
it after using it to go back home in the positive

301
00:27:52,324 --> 00:27:57,207
matter universe. You can learn more about the
Fantastic Four in their duel episode against

302
00:27:57,267 --> 00:28:02,411
the Justice Society. After conquering much of
the Negative Zone, Annihilus set his sights

303
00:28:02,511 --> 00:28:08,755
on the Microverse and tried to invade Subatomica.
Though he was successful, he and his army were

304
00:28:08,795 --> 00:28:13,799
eventually repelled. Annihilus briefly teamed
up with Mr. Fantastic when the hero was trapped

305
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:14,399
in the Negative

306
00:28:17,762 --> 00:28:22,785
from taking over both positive and negative
dimensions. After Annihilus formed a truce

307
00:28:22,825 --> 00:28:28,388
with fellow Negative Zone warlord Blastar, he
showed his new ally his newest and greatest

308
00:28:28,448 --> 00:28:35,192
addition to his scavenger army, a robot created
by AIM called the Super Adaptoid. Suspicious

309
00:28:35,232 --> 00:28:40,755
of Annihilus' plans, Blastar's wife sent out
a distress signal to the Avengers, who came

310
00:28:40,835 --> 00:28:46,667
and defeated Annihilus, Blastar, and the Super
Adaptoid. For her actions, Annihilus killed

311
00:28:46,707 --> 00:28:52,871
Blastar's wife, and Blastar in turn stole the
cosmic control rod. Without his weapon of choice,

312
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:58,896
Annihilus snuck onto Earth and took Mr. Fantastic
and Invisible Woman's son, Franklin, hostage,

313
00:28:59,356 --> 00:29:05,100
forcing the Fantastic Four to go into the Negative
Zone and confront Blastar to get it back. Though

314
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,683
Annihilus planned for his army to invade Earth's
dimension through a portal in the

315
00:29:12,974 --> 00:29:18,616
The Fantastic Four, alongside the Avengers,
were able to stop Annihilus. Later, he tried

316
00:29:18,636 --> 00:29:23,978
to invade the realm of Asgard when it temporarily
drifted into the Negative Zone at a time when

317
00:29:24,018 --> 00:29:29,301
its Bifrost Rainbow Bridge was shattered. Annihilus
was able to defeat every Asgardian warrior,

318
00:29:29,621 --> 00:29:35,664
including Thor, but was ultimately defeated
by Odin. Unable to accept his defeat, Annihilus

319
00:29:35,744 --> 00:29:41,218
kidnapped Odin in his sleep, and then lost in
a second battle with Thor. who then returned

320
00:29:41,378 --> 00:29:46,783
Odin back to Asgard, which was now gone from
the Negative Zone. Eventually, Annihilus discovered

321
00:29:46,823 --> 00:29:51,887
his old creators, the once thought lost to time
Tianans, though they were under the control

322
00:29:51,927 --> 00:29:57,091
of another villain known as Brute. Teaming up
with Mr. Fantastic, Annihilus defeated the

323
00:29:57,111 --> 00:30:02,075
Brute and freed the Tianans, though Mr. Fantastic
created a force field around their home planet

324
00:30:02,395 --> 00:30:07,479
to protect the species from Annihilus trying
to conquer them. When a corporation called

325
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:13,003
the Gideon Trust breached the Negative Zone
to mine its resources, they also stole Annihilus'

326
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:18,308
Cosmic Control Rod. During his efforts to get
his weapon back, the rod was shattered, and

327
00:30:18,348 --> 00:30:24,213
Annihilus was finally killed. However, upon
his death, his body released a pod containing

328
00:30:24,373 --> 00:30:30,178
insectoid larva that was cloned from Annihilus
as part of his failsafe plan for death. The

329
00:30:30,238 --> 00:30:35,822
larva grew, possessing all of Annihilus' memories
and intelligence. However, it was later discovered

330
00:30:35,862 --> 00:30:41,046
that multiple cloned larvae had spawned from
the pod, forcing one of the Annihilus clones

331
00:30:41,126 --> 00:30:47,130
to kill the rest. This surviving Annihilus rebuilt
the cosmic control rod and discovered a powerful

332
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:52,453
energy source known as the Opposing Force, which
was the negative zone equivalent to the Power

333
00:30:52,533 --> 00:30:58,076
Cosmic, which is wielded by Silver Surfer and
Galactus, both of whom you can learn more about

334
00:30:58,136 --> 00:31:03,520
in their respective dual episodes. After learning
that the positive matter universe was expanding

335
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:08,643
into the antimatter negative zone, Annihilus
felt that the positive matter universe was

336
00:31:08,683 --> 00:31:15,028
now part of his domain. Using the opposing force,
he led his massive insect scavenger armada

337
00:31:15,128 --> 00:31:19,971
through the energy surge that separated the
two universes and he led a full assault across

338
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:26,876
the cosmos that was called the Annihilation
Wave. Annihilus's armies devastated whole galaxies

339
00:31:27,236 --> 00:31:33,027
and an untold number of worlds. He killed a
multitude of cosmic heroes, captured galactus

340
00:31:33,087 --> 00:31:38,951
and all power cosmic wielding heroes, and laid
waste to entire alien empires and species.

341
00:31:39,531 --> 00:31:45,054
It took the combined alliance of nearly every
living hero outside of earth to eventually

342
00:31:45,114 --> 00:31:50,657
stop Annihilus and his wave. But when Nova finally
ripped Annihilus' organs from out of his throat,

343
00:31:51,257 --> 00:31:56,960
Annihilus was merely reborn on a Kree planet
that was ceded to his invasion, and he grew

344
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,062
to his former self back in the negative zone.
Annihilus later killed the Human Torch after

345
00:32:02,082 --> 00:32:06,383
the heroes sacrificed himself to keep the Warlord
from invading the positive matter universe

346
00:32:06,764 --> 00:32:12,085
from a portal in the Baxter building. The Human
Torch was kept alive though using healing worms

347
00:32:12,185 --> 00:32:17,247
that stitched together his body so that Annihilus
might get him to reopen the portal. But the

348
00:32:17,287 --> 00:32:22,228
heroes stole the cosmic control rod and escaped
the negative zone back to Earth. Despite no

349
00:32:22,268 --> 00:32:26,669
longer wielding his weapon, Annihilus proved
to be enough of a threat from his devastating

350
00:32:26,894 --> 00:32:31,837
prior invasion to earn himself a seat on the
Galactic Council as a representative of the

351
00:32:31,877 --> 00:32:37,581
Negative Zone, eventually getting his rod back
after a fight with the Fantastic Four. Later

352
00:32:37,681 --> 00:32:43,005
Annihilus studied the Hulk and learned the secret
of his Gamma Transformation from Bruce Banner.

353
00:32:43,465 --> 00:32:49,889
He used this knowledge to grow into a massive
giant, from there absorbing his entire dimension,

354
00:32:50,029 --> 00:32:55,073
becoming an all-powerful entity in the Negative
Zone. It took the combined efforts of the Guardians

355
00:32:55,113 --> 00:33:01,216
of the Galaxy, Thanos and the Shi'ar Imperial
Guard to stop him, where Adam Warlock devolved

356
00:33:01,256 --> 00:33:06,178
Annihilus into a small bug and Thanos stomped
on him. You can learn more about the Guardians

357
00:33:06,358 --> 00:33:11,780
and Thanos in their respective dual episodes.
Again, Annihilus was reborn in the Negative

358
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:17,322
Zone where he currently remains, having recently
gained a foothold in the Positive Matter universe

359
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:23,465
by invading a planet called Praxis II and transforming
it into Annihilation World, which was a new

360
00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:30,240
bridge into the Negative Zone. That's his backstory.
Powers-wise, Annihilus is an evolved insectivoreid

361
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:36,903
with enhanced physical abilities including increased
strength able to lift 50 tons, increased speed

362
00:33:36,963 --> 00:33:42,786
with flight, and an indestructible exoskeleton
that can withstand even a nova flame. He's

363
00:33:42,846 --> 00:33:47,908
virtually immortal as his cosmic control rod
halts his aging, and he has a failsafe for

364
00:33:47,988 --> 00:33:54,024
death involving resurrection via cloned larva.
His cosmic control rod can also fire massive

365
00:33:54,064 --> 00:33:59,288
amounts of incredibly destructive energy, up
to 10 megatons. It can manipulate matter using

366
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:04,772
the opposing force and create portals within
and to and from the negative zone to travel

367
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:11,237
through or summon his scavengers or other creatures.
He's a gifted engineer and scientist, though

368
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:17,522
Annihilus's strategic thinking usually incorporates
some form of overwhelming force. His one weakness

369
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:23,539
is his mouth, as it's a way to get past his
exoskeleton. into his more vulnerable interior.

370
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,663
And that's Nihilus. I mean, I guess that's an
interesting backstory. I don't think it's as

371
00:34:27,763 --> 00:34:32,667
interesting as Mongul's, I have to say. But
you know, it's good enough for Marvel. He's

372
00:34:32,727 --> 00:34:36,751
basically as powerful as like a herald of Galactus,
but instead of wielding the power of cosmic,

373
00:34:37,091 --> 00:34:41,355
you know, he wields the opposing force. Right,
yeah, it definitely seems like a powerful dude.

374
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:47,320
But I think Mongul's got him in this matchup.
Let me tell you all about Mongul. Little is

375
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:52,718
known about the early life of Mongul. other
than he's the disgraced ruler and former tyrant

376
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:59,460
of an unknown planet of billions, until an ancient
priest named Archimandite led a revolt that

377
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:05,022
overthrew Mongol's reign. Stripped of his power,
Mongol scoured the universe for a source of

378
00:35:05,082 --> 00:35:10,984
power that granted him the strength to never
lose power again. Eventually, Mongol learned

379
00:35:11,024 --> 00:35:16,045
of an artifact known as the Crystal Key that
could activate a planetary weapon known as

380
00:35:16,205 --> 00:35:21,439
Warworld. The key was located in a vault on
the fourth planet of the Cygnus star system,

381
00:35:21,799 --> 00:35:26,380
which was stored there by Martian Manhunter
at the behest of a deceased race of peaceful

382
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:32,942
aliens known as the Largus. After failing to
defeat Martian Manhunter to get the key, Mungo

383
00:35:32,982 --> 00:35:38,223
learned of Superman, and he kidnapped low slain
Jimmy Olsen and Daily Planet reporter Steve

384
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:43,745
Lombardi in order to force Superman to fight
Martian Manhunter and get the key for him.

385
00:35:44,125 --> 00:35:49,144
Which Superman did. You can learn more about
Superman in our Superman vs. Dr. Doom episode.

386
00:35:49,625 --> 00:35:55,429
After Martian Manhunter rescued Superman's friends,
he and Superman fought Mongul together, though

387
00:35:55,449 --> 00:36:00,253
Mongul was able to teleport himself and a ship
away as soon as he got his hands on the key.

388
00:36:00,733 --> 00:36:05,537
After Mongul successfully activated Warworld,
the psychic link he now had over the planet

389
00:36:05,677 --> 00:36:10,961
overwhelmed him when he attempted to destroy
Superman, and Mongul was forced to flee the

390
00:36:10,981 --> 00:36:16,571
battle. Later, Mungoal was able to defeat Starman
on the planet Throneworld, a world capable

391
00:36:16,611 --> 00:36:21,972
of destroying other planets, and took control
of its superweapon. Superman intervened by

392
00:36:22,052 --> 00:36:27,814
rescuing Starman, however, and Mungoal was once
again forced to retreat. Desperate for revenge

393
00:36:27,834 --> 00:36:33,796
against Superman, Mungoal infected the hero
with a parasitic psychic plant known as Black

394
00:36:33,916 --> 00:36:39,986
Mercy on Superman's birthday that placed Superman
in a paralyzed dream state. where he dreamt

395
00:36:40,006 --> 00:36:45,527
that he had grown up on the planet Krypton,
which had never exploded. Superman's mind rejected

396
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:50,629
the illusion, however, and he broke free of
the Black Mercy, before Mongul himself became

397
00:36:50,669 --> 00:36:55,710
infected and trapped in a never-ending dream
of universal conquest. After the Crisis on

398
00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:01,512
Infinite Earth storyline merged to DC's multiverse
and created a new continuity, Mongul was once

399
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:06,673
again in control of Warworld, with which he
conquered and enslaved entire star systems.

400
00:37:07,278 --> 00:37:12,580
To distract and control the denizens of his
empire, Mongol hosted gladiatorial games on

401
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:17,543
Warworld that were fought by the strongest among
those he had enslaved. During a time when Superman

402
00:37:17,563 --> 00:37:22,786
had exiled himself from Earth after killing
Zod, he was captured by Warworld, and Mongol

403
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:28,929
forced Superman to compete in the arena. Superman
rose amongst the gladiatorial ranks to Mongol's

404
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:34,552
disdain, and Mongol arranged a battle between
the hero and Warworld's fiercest warrior, an

405
00:37:34,713 --> 00:37:40,595
alien known as Draga. when Superman defeated
Drago but refused to kill him, challenging

406
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:46,616
Mungo in rebellion instead. An enraged Mungo
attacked and nearly killed Superman before

407
00:37:46,656 --> 00:37:51,698
the hero was teleported away by an alien cleric
with ties to Krypton that had been watching

408
00:37:51,738 --> 00:37:57,160
the battle. Superman's act of defiance spurred
a rebellion on Warworld, and Drago was able

409
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:02,561
to defeat Mungo and take control of the giant
weapon after removing Mungo's crystal amulet

410
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:08,143
that he wore on his chest. Swearing revenge
and stealing a city-sized space cruiser, Mongul

411
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:12,864
fled Warworld, which was later taken over by
the villain Brainiac, who you can learn more

412
00:38:12,884 --> 00:38:18,025
about in our Brainiac vs Ultron episode. Mongul
ended up on a small planet known as Paraton

413
00:38:18,485 --> 00:38:24,647
V, which he was able to conquer easily due to
its technological inferiority. Mongul's starcraft,

414
00:38:24,687 --> 00:38:30,769
however, became infected by the mind of Hank
Henshaw, who would later become Cyborg Superman,

415
00:38:31,149 --> 00:38:35,854
and who managed to overpower Mongul. as its
ship was the most advanced technology accessible

416
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:40,916
on the planet. After Superman's death at the
hands of Doomsday, Mongol traveled to Earth

417
00:38:40,976 --> 00:38:46,437
under Cyborg Superman's orders and used his
Starcraft to destroy Coast City, the home of

418
00:38:46,457 --> 00:38:51,278
the Green Lantern, Hal Jordan, who you can learn
more about in our Green Lantern vs. Nova episode.

419
00:38:51,678 --> 00:38:57,620
In place of Coast City, Mongol quickly constructed
a massive engine, which he named Engine City,

420
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:02,801
and gave it to Cyborg Superman, who had framed
another Superman imposter known as the Eradicator

421
00:39:03,214 --> 00:39:08,416
over Coast City's destruction. With plans to
betray Cyborg Superman and destroy Metropolis

422
00:39:08,736 --> 00:39:13,458
in an effort to create a second engine as part
of an overall plot to turn Earth into a new

423
00:39:13,538 --> 00:39:19,121
war world, Mongol's plans were foiled by the
real Superman, who by this point had returned

424
00:39:19,141 --> 00:39:24,283
from the dead. Though Mongol nearly succeeded
in killing Superman as Engine City was powered

425
00:39:24,303 --> 00:39:30,185
by kryptonite gas, a rage-fueled Green Lantern
overpowered Mongol, who was imprisoned on Earth.

426
00:39:30,654 --> 00:39:35,678
After escaping prison multiple times, Mungle
was transferred to a satellite prison orbiting

427
00:39:35,718 --> 00:39:41,302
the moon, where he was forced to undergo experimental
mental reconditioning to pacify him. Mungle

428
00:39:41,362 --> 00:39:46,306
fooled the scientists there into believing that
their methods were working, and when opportunity

429
00:39:46,406 --> 00:39:51,530
struck, Mungle slaughtered everyone on board
and fled the solar system in a spacecraft.

430
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:57,115
Though he nearly died adrift in space after
his ship was randomly attacked, he was rescued

431
00:39:57,155 --> 00:40:02,935
by the peaceful citizens of the planet Debstam
IV. which he quickly conquered. Unwilling to

432
00:40:02,955 --> 00:40:07,838
be ruled over and succumbing to a fatal disease
that Mongol had unknowingly brought to the

433
00:40:07,878 --> 00:40:14,561
planet, the citizens of Depstem IV sabotaged
all spacecrafts and committed suicide, trapping

434
00:40:14,601 --> 00:40:20,885
Mongol on the planet with no one to rule over
save for two children, a son and daughter that

435
00:40:20,905 --> 00:40:26,228
he had fathered that were immune to the disease.
Mongol was eventually teleported to Earth by

436
00:40:26,248 --> 00:40:31,935
the demon Niron, who made an example of Mongol
by killing him in front of Earth's other villains.

437
00:40:32,455 --> 00:40:39,098
Mongul's son, known as Mongul II, grew rapidly
and studied his father's legacy. After several

438
00:40:39,118 --> 00:40:43,720
battles with the Justice League, Mongul and
his sister Mongal were teleported to their

439
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:49,803
home planet, where Mongul killed his sister.
During the Blackest Night event, Mongul II's

440
00:40:49,883 --> 00:40:54,745
father returned as a Black Lantern and killed
all of the slaves that his son had acquired.

441
00:40:55,245 --> 00:41:01,962
Escaping his father, Mongul II acquired Yellow
Lantern Rings by killing Yellow Lanterns, wearing

442
00:41:02,102 --> 00:41:07,827
one ring on each finger of his right hand. Mongul
assumed control over the Sinestro Corps, which

443
00:41:07,867 --> 00:41:14,032
he renamed the Mongul Corps after taking control
of Warworld and making it the Corps' new homeworld

444
00:41:14,092 --> 00:41:20,257
base. Sinestro later confronted Mongul, however,
and, using a failsafe that Sinestro built into

445
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:26,474
each of the Yellow Lantern Rings, defeated Mongul
and retook control of the Corps. In post-Flashpoint

446
00:41:26,494 --> 00:41:33,776
continuity, Mongul was now Mongul the 1791st,
and was revealed to be the descendant of a

447
00:41:33,856 --> 00:41:40,618
long line of rulers within a race of alien conquerors
known as the War Zun, inhabitants of the ancient

448
00:41:40,658 --> 00:41:46,639
and powerful Warworld Prime, which had been
created by the Old Gods. After assuming control

449
00:41:46,659 --> 00:41:51,161
of Warworld Prime once again, dwarfing the other
Warworlds, Mongul

450
00:41:54,910 --> 00:42:00,695
over his core of yellow lanterns. Though he
nearly succeeded, Sinestro turned Mongols hired

451
00:42:00,775 --> 00:42:08,762
mercenaries against him, and later Mongul was
killed by his son, Mongul the 1792nd, who now

452
00:42:08,822 --> 00:42:15,227
rules over Warworld. The powers-wise, Mongul
possesses vast strength and durability natural

453
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:20,952
to the war-zoon race, who live upon the harsh
environment of Warworld. The crystal amulet

454
00:42:21,012 --> 00:42:27,049
embedded on his chest passed down from the very
first Mongol ruler, only increases his power

455
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:33,113
and allows him to emit powerful energy blasts
from his chest, eyes, or hands. Mongol also

456
00:42:33,153 --> 00:42:38,657
possesses an array of technological trinkets
that allow him to teleport, shrink others into

457
00:42:38,717 --> 00:42:45,162
small energy cubes, and mentally control Warworld,
a planet-sized weapon equipped with missiles,

458
00:42:45,542 --> 00:42:51,986
energy cannons, and war machines that can conquer
and destroy other planets. Mongol is also a

459
00:42:52,026 --> 00:42:57,590
strategic and scientific genius, having created
a genetically modified Black Mercy parasitic

460
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:04,095
plant to induce paralysis by physically bringing
about the hosts worst nightmares. And that's

461
00:43:04,155 --> 00:43:10,400
Mongol. Why does his story seem like a rip off
of the movie Gladiator? Like why is DC so unoriginal?

462
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:17,585
Dude, I thought the same thing, but apparently
gladiators rip off of the Mongol story. It's

463
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:22,727
crazy, right? Somebody better sue Universal
Pictures is all I'm saying. That's also what

464
00:43:22,747 --> 00:43:27,353
I'm thinking. Although who knows, next year
Universal may own Mongol, so they'd just be

465
00:43:27,393 --> 00:43:28,013
suing themselves.

466
00:43:35,202 --> 00:43:39,603
But now that we've got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

467
00:43:39,663 --> 00:43:46,024
of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not the speculation,

468
00:43:46,305 --> 00:43:51,666
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could
play out. Alfred Jarvis9000, what are the rules

469
00:43:51,746 --> 00:43:56,607
of our speculation? Well, I should say there
are no rules, other than the characters have

470
00:43:56,647 --> 00:44:01,409
no prior knowledge of the other going into the
fight. All they are aware of starting out is

471
00:44:01,429 --> 00:44:06,034
that the other character is a threat that needs
to be eliminated. For the speculation, the

472
00:44:06,054 --> 00:44:11,097
contestants will begin approximately 50 meters
apart in a non-descript environment that will

473
00:44:11,117 --> 00:44:16,460
have no bearing on the match itself, as no environmental
statistics are considered in my simulations.

474
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:21,983
The contestants must earn victory on their own
merit. Alright then, let's get into it. Mongol

475
00:44:22,083 --> 00:44:27,386
and Annihilus meet on the battlefield? Who goes
first? I'm going to say that Annihilus goes

476
00:44:27,426 --> 00:44:34,418
first because he seems more maniacal than the
more like brooding Mongol. So Annihilus starts

477
00:44:34,478 --> 00:44:39,740
off by blitzing Mongol, reaching him in less
than a second, and just flying into him and

478
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:45,503
tackling him to the ground. Okay, except that
Annihilus tackles nothing but air, cause Mongol

479
00:44:45,543 --> 00:44:50,905
teleports out of the way, poof. And when Annihilus
stops to look for Mongol, that's when Mongol

480
00:44:51,005 --> 00:44:56,067
reappears behind him, and with like a single
punch, just knocks Annihilus into the horizon,

481
00:44:56,547 --> 00:45:03,130
to where Mongol teleports and is waiting for
him. All right, well. Okay, so Annihilus, you

482
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:07,994
know, he skids across the floor a few times
and then lands at the feet of Mongol again,

483
00:45:08,674 --> 00:45:15,079
uh, looking up at him. But that's exactly where
Annihilus wants him. Because from the ground,

484
00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:20,642
he's gonna fire a blast of cosmic energy from
his cosmic control rod right up at Mongol.

485
00:45:21,283 --> 00:45:26,747
And the blast is so massive, it sends Mongol
literally into space, into the orbit of whatever

486
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:32,046
planet they're fighting on. And Mongol can't
fly, so he's like, Whoa! you know, spinning

487
00:45:32,086 --> 00:45:38,610
around the world. But a Nihilus can fly and
he flies up to Mongol and just like lands this

488
00:45:38,831 --> 00:45:45,375
massive uppercut into Mongol's big ass target
of a chin. Well, I wouldn't say that Mongol

489
00:45:45,415 --> 00:45:52,240
can't fly. I think there's been some feats where
it's shown that he can, but it's extremely

490
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:57,884
rare. Mostly he's seen as like more of a leaper,
like the Hulk. But sure, yeah, he's in space

491
00:45:57,924 --> 00:46:03,555
right now. And you know, he's definitely caught
off guard. but as he's tumbling through space,

492
00:46:03,935 --> 00:46:10,000
that's when he summons War World into the planet's
orbit, which beams both him and Annihilus to

493
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:15,944
the planet's surface. So now this match is gonna
take place in War World's battle arena. Nice.

494
00:46:16,164 --> 00:46:21,968
But I'm gonna say that if like, Mongol can summon
War World into this match, then Annihilus can

495
00:46:22,008 --> 00:46:27,331
summon his Annihilation Wave. Okay? Okay. That's
only fair, right? So he's gonna open up this

496
00:46:27,391 --> 00:46:32,106
portal into the negative zone using his Cosmic
Control Rod. and through it is gonna come this

497
00:46:32,146 --> 00:46:38,530
entire fleet of insectivored ships and they
just arrive like a plague of locusts just blotting

498
00:46:38,590 --> 00:46:43,973
out the stars with how dense their numbers are.
Okay that's fine you know Warworld is gonna

499
00:46:44,013 --> 00:46:49,696
be busy blasting all these ships to smithereens
and meanwhile Mongol he's gonna fire his own

500
00:46:49,776 --> 00:46:55,919
energy blast from his chest crystal which just
sends a Nihilus crashing into the edge of the

501
00:46:55,959 --> 00:47:04,555
arena and Warworld citizens are like Maaagol.
Yeah, and those chants quickly turn into shouts

502
00:47:04,615 --> 00:47:11,198
of, Oh my god, we're fucking dying! When the
Annihilation wave just starts nuking the shit

503
00:47:11,238 --> 00:47:15,660
out of Warworld, just everything around the
battle arena and the whole planet is just getting

504
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:20,282
blasted to bits, there's devastation everywhere,
but you know, Annihilus doesn't care because

505
00:47:20,302 --> 00:47:26,144
he's indestructible. And as the gladiatorial
arena's floor opens up from being split from

506
00:47:26,184 --> 00:47:31,259
the destruction, Annihilus is gonna rush up
to Maagol. grab him and then slam him through

507
00:47:31,279 --> 00:47:35,102
the planet's surface. Oh, you know who else
doesn't care about what's happening around

508
00:47:35,122 --> 00:47:40,427
them? Mongol. Cause those nukes that are coming
from the annihilation wave ships aren't doing

509
00:47:40,487 --> 00:47:46,632
shit besides revealing new layers of weaponry.
Like each Mongol ruler essentially created

510
00:47:46,652 --> 00:47:52,657
a new layer of weaponized surface to Warworld
Prime. So we've got like almost 2000 more layers

511
00:47:52,677 --> 00:48:00,022
to go here. So as Annihilus slams Mongol onto
the next surface, Mongol just kicks Annihilus

512
00:48:00,042 --> 00:48:05,803
like miles away, and Annihilus in turn gets
slammed by a massive targeted missile that

513
00:48:05,843 --> 00:48:11,285
just obliterates Annihilus along with like the
next three layers of Warworld's surface, like

514
00:48:11,365 --> 00:48:18,887
leaving this giant crater. Oh yeah? Forcefield!
Damn it! So in the center of this crater that

515
00:48:18,987 --> 00:48:25,109
Mongol just blasted in his own planet is Annihilus
surrounded and protected by this personal cosmic

516
00:48:25,129 --> 00:48:30,971
energy forcefield. It protected him from the
blast. So he's fine and he's gonna fly up to

517
00:48:31,011 --> 00:48:36,554
join the Annihilation Wave ships and he's gonna
board the greatest of their ships which is

518
00:48:36,594 --> 00:48:41,837
called the Harvester of Sorrows. And that was
a ship that the Annihilation Wave used to destroy

519
00:48:41,897 --> 00:48:47,640
planets and it literally uses the planet's energy
as fuel. So the Harvester ship is just gonna

520
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:53,423
send out this planet-sized energy blast that
consumes Warworld with Mongul on it. I mean

521
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:59,134
like maybe like a baby planet-sized energy blast
like World Prime. No! is pretty fucking huge.

522
00:48:59,155 --> 00:49:05,939
Dude, the Annihilation Wave has destroyed plenty
of planets of all sizes, some that were multiple

523
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:13,685
times the size of Earth, so. Dude, big whoop,
Warworld can destroy entire suns. So it meets

524
00:49:13,845 --> 00:49:20,110
this ship's energy blast with its own, and when
the beams collide, it's gonna generate this

525
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:27,311
massive explosion that destroys not only the
Harvester of Sorrows, but the entire annihilation

526
00:49:27,351 --> 00:49:33,374
wave. And Annihilus, obviously. Okay, this has
to be like a massive explosion. If this explosion

527
00:49:33,434 --> 00:49:38,937
is big enough to destroy the entire annihilation
wave, that explosion is also gonna destroy

528
00:49:38,997 --> 00:49:44,460
Warworld too. Like there's no way around that.
So like in the midst of space, there's all

529
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:49,543
this debris from the planet and the ships and
there's bodies everywhere and devastation,

530
00:49:50,083 --> 00:49:56,266
but surviving it all in the center of it is
Annihilus. The indestructible Annihilus just

531
00:49:56,306 --> 00:50:01,908
floating in the middle of it all. Mongols vaporized.
Marvel wins. I don't know what makes you think

532
00:50:01,968 --> 00:50:08,790
that Warworld would get annihilated by this.
Like, it's a fucking tank planet. Yeah, and

533
00:50:08,990 --> 00:50:14,591
the Annihilation Wave is a big-ass armada. Okay,
well I mean, you're probably right that Mongol

534
00:50:14,631 --> 00:50:20,993
wouldn't survive a blast that could also destroy
all of Warworld Prime, as ridiculous as that

535
00:50:21,093 --> 00:50:26,836
is. So sure, Annihilus is floating out there,
you know, feeling victorious. Except that the

536
00:50:26,856 --> 00:50:33,659
whole thing was a dream. What? When Mongol first
teleported behind Annihilus at the beginning

537
00:50:33,699 --> 00:50:39,021
of this match, instead of punching Kim, he really
just infected Annihilus with the Black Mercy

538
00:50:39,101 --> 00:50:46,044
parasitic plant, which paralyzed Annihilus and
gave him this delusion of this epic battle

539
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:50,538
in which he came out on top. But in reality,
While Annihilus is just standing there grinning

540
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:55,741
like an idiot lost in thought, that's when Mongol
is just going to reach down his giant ass mouth

541
00:50:55,781 --> 00:51:03,185
and tear his spine out. Except that whole idea
is stupid and I hate it. I honestly forgot

542
00:51:03,285 --> 00:51:08,868
entirely about the Black Mercy plant. But we'll
leave the scenario there. Either one of two

543
00:51:08,888 --> 00:51:14,111
things happens depending on the results of this
match. Either the most epic battle of all time

544
00:51:14,151 --> 00:51:20,559
happens where a whole planet and armada of ships
is with Annihilus standing victorious through

545
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:26,962
it all, or Mongol just made it all a dream with
a parasitic plant and then rips out Annihilus'

546
00:51:26,982 --> 00:51:32,625
spine through his throat. That's the boring
way, mine is the cool way. Hopefully Annihilus

547
00:51:32,645 --> 00:51:36,688
wins this and that epic battle really happened.
But let's go ahead and enter the character

548
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:43,592
stats and run the simulations and find out which
character is going to win. AJ9K, hit it! Inputting

549
00:51:43,612 --> 00:51:50,679
data. Running calculations. Processing results.
Simulations complete. So stats wise, the two

550
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:56,283
characters were pretty even on a number of categories.
You know, they're both extremely durable, they

551
00:51:56,303 --> 00:52:02,166
could both deal a ton of damage, and they both
have about equal range and intelligence. There

552
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:06,088
were a number of differences though. We said
that Annihilus was faster just through the

553
00:52:06,128 --> 00:52:11,772
speed feats he has. Mongol is not quite as fast
as Annihilus, seemingly according to their

554
00:52:11,812 --> 00:52:16,894
actions in the comics. Annihilus is also more
evasive. than Mongol considering that not only

555
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:23,016
can he fly, but he also can produce force fields
using his cosmic control rod. And it's not

556
00:52:23,036 --> 00:52:27,957
like Mongol doesn't move again, he's sort of
like the Hulk in that regard, but he does sort

557
00:52:27,997 --> 00:52:33,039
of enjoy also tanking a lot of shots. Yeah,
in place he's got a big old head and that thing's

558
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:40,041
not dodging anything. We did say Mongol was
stronger than the Nihilus, definitely for sure,

559
00:52:40,201 --> 00:52:45,692
as well as a better fighter. Annihilus is kind
of just like this crazed maniac brawler guy,

560
00:52:45,972 --> 00:52:51,756
but Mongol actually has a significant amount
of fight training and experience. Right. Exactly.

561
00:52:52,276 --> 00:52:57,300
So considering all that, Jonathan, who is coming
out on top in this match? It's got to be Mongol.

562
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:03,544
Like, he's way stronger and, you know, he's
just as durable. It's got to be Mongol. This

563
00:53:03,584 --> 00:53:08,167
guy could take on Superman. He could take on
Wonder Roman. There's no way in hell he can't

564
00:53:08,207 --> 00:53:13,074
take on fucking Annihilus. Just this little
bug that can be squashed. Though it looks like

565
00:53:13,154 --> 00:53:19,138
Instagram both agrees and disagrees with me
because it was a 50-50 split on who they thought

566
00:53:19,158 --> 00:53:23,902
would come out on top in this match. And that's
pretty surprising because we got quite a number

567
00:53:23,942 --> 00:53:29,065
of votes for this one, like around 30 or 40
or something like that. Yeah. So the fact that

568
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:34,329
it came out pretty even makes me think that
this was seemingly a pretty even matchup. Yeah,

569
00:53:34,369 --> 00:53:38,392
it definitely looks like both characters have
their share of fans. Let's find out if this

570
00:53:38,472 --> 00:53:44,896
was an even matchup by revealing the winner.
8g9k the results please. Here you are sir.

571
00:53:44,956 --> 00:53:55,721
Alright the winner between the cosmic villains
of mongol and anialis is Anialis But it was

572
00:53:55,821 --> 00:54:03,145
really close These guys went tit for tat Not
quite even But definitely measuring up to each

573
00:54:03,205 --> 00:54:11,430
other Anialis only won 504 matches out of 1000
Holy shit! Barely squeaking over 50% at 50.4%

574
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:20,694
where Mongol won 496 matches at 49.6%. Holy
shit that is really close. These results have

575
00:54:20,714 --> 00:54:24,936
got to be the closest to what our Instagram
followers thought it would be, that we've ever

576
00:54:24,976 --> 00:54:29,858
done. Maybe, like it was interesting how the
characters weren't very similar stats-wise,

577
00:54:29,898 --> 00:54:34,800
like they had a lot of differences and yet it
still came out as close as a coin toss. I'm

578
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:39,430
actually glad that it was close because both
characters I think are really cool. I think

579
00:54:39,470 --> 00:54:46,271
both deserved to win. We should note that we
did not factor in Warworld itself or Annihilus's

580
00:54:46,391 --> 00:54:51,173
army into these stat figures. Right, because
the characters have to win on their own merits.

581
00:54:51,633 --> 00:54:58,515
That being said, Warworld is the ultimate weapon
and there's no reason to say why Mongol wouldn't

582
00:54:58,575 --> 00:55:03,056
take advantage of using it. Same for Annihilus
with his annihilation wave especially against

583
00:55:03,136 --> 00:55:07,777
a villain as powerful as Mongol. These guys
both have resources, they may as well use them,

584
00:55:07,977 --> 00:55:12,408
you know? I think it makes for a better match
that way. Very true. But that does it for this

00:55:12,468 --> 00:55:16,511

597

We're going to review the upcoming Marvel Studios
movie, The Marvels. Jonathan, do you have any

598
00:56:18,614 --> 00:56:23,838
predictions for that one? Yeah, I think it's
going to suck. All right. Well, Jonathan has

599
00:56:23,878 --> 00:56:28,561
low expectations, which means that he's going
to be pleasantly surprised with the quality

600
00:56:28,581 --> 00:56:34,345
of the film. We'll see and probably love it.
All right. But that does it for this episode.
