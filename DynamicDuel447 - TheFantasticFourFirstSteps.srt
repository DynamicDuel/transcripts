00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:40,400
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. And I'm his twin
brother Johnny DC. And in this episode we are

2
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:46,140
reviewing the Fantastic Four First Steps film
that came out this past week. I'm excited to talk

3
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:53,700
about it. I thought it was fucking fantastic.
Hashtag FF. For fucking fantastic. Hashtag FFS.

4
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:00,440
Fantastic First Steps. Towards a better MCU. And I
mean what a great time to be a comic book movie fan

5
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,500
right now. I mean not earlier in the year but right
now. A Marvel fan for sure. I have the opinion that

6
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:12,600
it's never a good time to be a DC fan. So I mean we'll
see if the box office agrees with you right? What

7
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,620
does the box office have to do with anything? I
don't know. Superman just looks like he's coming

8
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:22,300
on top so I thought I would rub it in. You don't know
that and the ongoing bet is for the final worldwide

9
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:28,040
box office figures. Not just opening weekend. For
the entire theatrical run. That's fair. But a

10
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,820
movie does make a majority of its money in the
opening weekend. I think that's true. I don't know

11
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,420
man. Superman's doing pretty well. I think a lot of
people are happy with both films really and they

12
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,380
should be because they were both great. Yeah.
Marvel's put out three decent to great movies this

13
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:49,620
year. DC has put out one movie. That's great.
That's super you could say. It was decent. So yeah.

14
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,300
This whole Marvel DC rivalry where Marvel's
winning is still going strong. Yeah winning gets

15
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,920
sucking. But we're going to talk all about our
thoughts on the Fantastic Four First Steps movie

16
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,380
later on in this episode. Before that we're going

39
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:17,880
that out of the way, quick to the no prize! A no prize
is an award that Marvel used to give out to fans. Our

40
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,880
version, the Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital
award that we pushed on Instagram for the person

41
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:29,480
that we feel gave the best answer to our question of
the week. Last week we asked, for those of you who

42
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:35,700
have seen the Fantastic Four first steps in its
opening weekend, what did you think? Yeah we got a

43
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:39,740
few answers, let's go ahead and run down the
honorable mentions as well as the no prize winner.

44
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:46,420
Before we get any further, I do want to put a spoiler
tag on all of these answers. All of our reviews are

45
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,440
spoiler reviews for this podcast, so if you
haven't seen the movie be sure you go check it out

46
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,600
before listening to our review or even listening
to these no prize answers. There's your warning,

47
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,420
go ahead and hit the pause button now if you haven't
seen the movie go see it and our first honorable

48
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:07,400
mention goes to Alex Albro, who said, Hey guys just
got back, I'd read it at seven, my wife said six and a

49
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,200
half. I really liked Read and Sue, they were really
really well done, I'm sold on Pedro. The thing in

50
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,660
the Surfer I didn't really like, the thing was too
comedic like Smart Hulk and Endgame. Surfer

51
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,560
didn't feel integral to the story, but seeing
Galactus for real was really cool and I can kind of

52
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,240
see where Franklin fits into Doom's potential
plan for Secret Wars. I thought that the Earth

53
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,340
moving was going to be the cause of incursions and
kind of start the playing field for Secret Wars,

54
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,360
but they kind of spurred me there. Overall, I
thought it was a pretty good movie. Yeah, there's a

55
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,520
point in the movie where Reed tries to teleport
Earth away from Galactus. I also thought that

56
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,040
maybe that was how the Fantastic Four were going to
find their way to the Earth 616 dimension since

57
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,840
they're from Earth 838, but the movie didn't do
that and actually for the end credit scene of the

58
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,180
Thunderbolts we see the Fantastic Four's ship
arrival to the main 616 dimension. I thought they

59
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:00,360
were going to address the why of that in the
Fantastic Four film, we never got that answer so it

60
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,180
looks like we're not going to find out what's going
on there until the actual Avengers Doomsday

61
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:09,640
movie. Yeah, I guess the film would have been
pretty anti-climactic if it just ended with them

62
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:17,560
in a new universe, either superimposed over the
existing Earth or possibly on the opposite side of

63
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,120
the sun. Something like that, we really would have
been able to see a final battle with Galactus if

64
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,260
that happened in that moment it was supposed to.
Right, and I'm glad we did get that climactic

65
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:32,700
scene. In regards to the thing, the thing is not the
Hulk, he's not supposed to be dark. I mean he does

66
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,300
have moments of self pity, but he's the
ever-loving blue-eyed thing, you know? He is a

67
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,900
little bit witty and funny. Great answer, Alex.
Our next honorable mention goes to Cornelius

68
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:49,940
Robinson, who said... Hey guys, this is Cornelius
and I've just seen Fantastic Four and it is

69
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:56,640
literally fantastic. I just love the cast and the
chemistry between them, which was a standout for

70
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:05,640
me. Galactus was terrifying and the visuals are
just out of this world for the MCU up to date. And

71
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:13,080
it's the most comic book MCU film that I have ever
watched, aside from Superman, and it was one of the

72
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:21,240
best. Now, I should clarify, Superman is not a part
of the MCU and it doesn't want to be. Yes, it does,

73
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:26,020
but yeah, I would say that the Fantastic Four movie
was comic book-y in the sense that it pulled a lot of

74
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:32,140
inspiration from the 1960s comic books written by
Stanley and drawn by Jack Kirby. It felt very much

75
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:37,900
of that era. Which is interesting considering
that both Superman and Fantastic Four both kind of

76
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:43,860
kicked off their respective comic book universes
in Action Comics Number One and in Fantastic Four

77
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:49,000
Number One, The Golden Age and the Silver Age of
Comics, as it were. Yeah, I mean Marvel was around

78
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:54,340
in the Golden Age, but they didn't really become
the pop culture supergiant that they were until

79
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:59,360
the 1960s. So it's kind of cool that both of these
films feel like they're among the most comic

80
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,780
book-y films of the genre. Great answer,
Cornelius. Our final honorable mention goes to

81
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:12,100
Lorenzo Valdez, who said, This is Lorenzo Valdez.
I just came out of a Thursday screening of the

82
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:19,260
Fantastic Four First Steps. I loved it. It is
Marvel Studios' best looking film from a visual

83
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:27,220
aesthetic standpoint. The final climactic
battle scene is super intense. The end credit song

84
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:33,380
is beautiful. The movie's still not as good as
Superman though. Clown of Forever and Always,

85
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:39,400
boba! You know what? I don't want Clark and Lana to
end up together. I guess I never did before, but

86
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:46,280
like, I'm more for sure about that now. Fantastic
Four was a great movie. Superman was pretty good.

87
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,240
I'll say that the Fantastic Four's artistic
direction with the retro-futurism style was a lot

88
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,000
more interesting. I agree with Lorenzo in that the
Fantastic Four movie is probably one of Marvel

89
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,600
Studios' best looking films to date. Yeah, I
definitely agree. I think the design approach

90
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,100
they took with the movie did a lot of favors. For
sure. We want to give a quick shout out to By Dear

91
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,900
Bangora for taking the time to reach out to us and
leave an answer, but the winner of this week's snow

92
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:21,980
prize is Gil Camacho. Who said? Ili Macho. And I,
Zezay Macho. And we are the Machos. Woo! That was a

93
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:29,040
good movie. We liked the movie. Only one word to
describe it. Fantastic. Zey, what time is it?

94
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,040
Clobbering time. You're darn right it's
clobbering time. Flame on! Hell yeah, it's

95
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:40,500
clobbering time! Although I gotta admit that due
to Scotty Camacho's answer, when we asked a

96
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,600
similar question regarding the Superman movie a
couple of weeks ago, not gonna lie, I thought his

97
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,160
son was gonna say it's clobbering time bitch just
for continuity. I was also anticipating that.

98
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,160
Although Johnny didn't say flame on in the movie.
Did he not? I don't remember. Yeah, I don't think he

99
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,380
did. That's fine because that was probably
another catchphrase from the cartoon too, you

100
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:05,760
know? Marvel hates catchphrases. Jerks. Thanks
for the fun answer, Gilly. You win this week's snow

101
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,080
prize. If you the listener want a shot at winning
Giro no prize, stay tuned to later on this episode

102
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:21,020
when we'll be asking another question of the week.
And now that that's done, on to the news. Okay, so

103
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:28,400
this past week was Comic-Con. And though Marvel
and DC didn't really have any kind of major movie

104
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:35,180
presence there, Peacemaker did have a panel to
which James Gunn showed up and revealed a new

105
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:41,380
official trailer for Peacemaker season two.
Peacemaker season one, which was a spin-off of

106
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:46,620
James Gunn's film, The Suicide Squad, was a really
good show. If you guys listen to our review, you'll

107
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:52,200
know that I really liked it. It was surprisingly
really heartfelt, as well as being freaking

108
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,880
hilarious. And it looks like season two is going to
be no different. Although now we have the gist of

109
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:07,140
the story in that Peacemaker is down and out in his
universe. And thanks to his father, he has portals

110
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:13,300
to other dimensions where he could go and find
better worlds to live in. It looks like Ric Flagg

111
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:19,940
Sr., the father of the man that Peacemaker killed
in The Suicide Squad film, doesn't like that. And

112
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:25,540
he wants to either shut down or confiscate
Peacemaker's portals. But it looks like it's

113
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:31,540
going to be good times. I love the cast of this show,
from Harcourt to Johnny Conomos, but my favorites

114
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:38,020
are definitely Adebio and Vigilante. Yeah,
they're fantastic. Does it seem like this season

115
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:44,380
is really setting up what the DC multiverse is and
how the DCU will compare to the DC EU? It kind of

116
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:51,300
seems that way, right? It almost seems like this
show is a way to bridge the gap between the DC EU and

117
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,720
the DCU, which is kind of strange because it's
coming out after the start of the DC EU. But

118
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,640
honestly, any kind of clarification is better
than none. And so like why some elements from the

119
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:09,040
DCU are the same, like John Cena as Peacemaker and
why some aren't. Like David Cornswet as Superman.

120
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:14,820
Right. I'm guessing in both dimensions though,
Peacemaker still killed Ric Flagg. Why would you

121
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,780
think that? Because otherwise the story would be
about Peacemaker escaping Ric Flagg senior

122
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:24,220
through an alternate dimension and then the
conflict is kind of just settled in that way. I

123
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:28,200
think there's something more to it. I don't know if
there's any more to it. What I think would be

124
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,340
hilarious is if it would kind of be like that one
Treehouse of Horror episode in The Simpsons,

125
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:38,340
where Homer Simpson messes with a toaster and ends
up traveling like through time and creating

126
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:43,600
different parallel worlds. And like each one has
something wrong with it. I kind of see that

127
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,680
happening here in a sense. Like in the end, though,
he kind of finally realizes maybe that his world is

128
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,580
best for him. Yeah. And then deal with the
consequences of his actions. Right. Exactly. The

129
00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:00,180
portals to the other dimensions through these
doors, it reminds me a lot of the Shazam Rock of

130
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,720
Eternity. I wonder if they're going to make some
kind of tie into that considering the producer of

131
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:12,620
the Shazam films was Peter Saffron, who is also now
a producer on all of the DC Studios projects. But

132
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:18,660
we'll see. I loved the doorway to that like giant
skull spider dimension. And Tim Meadows just

133
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:24,780
looks at the other person is like, no, let's not go
there. That was good. There's a lot of really funny

134
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:29,760
moments like that, including the beginning of the
trailer when vigilante is like tossing beers to

135
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,980
economist and he just can't catch them. And then at
the very end, when vigilante is like, we're going

136
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,780
to my secret layer, you're not allowed to come to
his mom. And she just follows them and starts like

137
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:46,080
blabbing about how he thinks economists is a huge
dork, something like that. Season two is starting

138
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:54,240
up here soon on the redubbed HBO Max, no longer just
called Max. It's coming out to August 21st, and

139
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,500
we'll definitely be reviewing it. The trailer
definitely got me excited. I don't know if it was as

140
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:04,480
good as the first teaser, but this one definitely
got me intrigued as to what explanations could be

141
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:12,400
offered regarding this new DCU. In other DC news,
we got the first trailer for Aztec Batman Clash of

142
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:19,040
Empires, which is a direct video animated film
that's coming out in mid September. Now we've

143
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,660
known about this film coming out this year for a
while. And I've been looking forward to it,

144
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,740
particularly the animation style, because
apparently all of the animation was done in

145
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:35,200
Mexico. Oh, interesting. Yeah, in the same way
that the Batman ninja films were done all in Japan,

146
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:40,740
I do have to say I thought the art style would be
different, like a lot different than what we're

147
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:47,560
getting. I'm kind of disappointed by that. But the
premise seems intriguing, at least. It's sort of

148
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:55,060
like revisionist history, where the conquering
of the Aztec Empire by the Spanish conquistadors

149
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:02,180
leads to the creation of an Aztec Batman.
Apparently this Batman is named Yo-Haw-Li

150
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:08,320
Ko-Waddle, probably not the correct
pronunciation, and Cortez murders Maktuzuma in

151
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:16,080
front of him. So Yehwalee has to flee and train with
one of the Aztec priests in the Temple of the Bat

152
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:21,740
God, Sina Kang. It was interesting to see the Aztec
version of other characters like Catwoman and

153
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:27,440
Poison Ivy as well. Oh yeah, Catwoman is actually
going to be called Jaguar Woman, and I guess she was

154
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,260
like a female Jaguar warrior. It was interesting
that Poison Ivy was kind of like this forest

155
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:37,760
goddess, and that Cortez himself apparently is
going to be Two-Face. Yeah, it's a pretty cool

156
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:43,080
concept. I'm really wondering how many of these,
like, what-if scenarios DC is planning on putting

157
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:49,280
out for Batman, because we've had, you know,
Lovecraftian Batman, there's Ninja Batman, of

158
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,940
course, there was Steampunk Batman, a whole bunch
of different kinds of Batman. Now we have Aztec

159
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:59,500
Batman, what else does DC have in store, I wonder?
Well, I mean, Steampunk Batman and Lovecraft

160
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:05,260
Horror Batman, those are both based off of graphic
novels, but the Batman Ninja and Aztec Batman

161
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:10,660
projects are original. It's pretty interesting
to see where else they could take this for sure, and

162
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:20,880
that brings to our question of the week. If you
could reimagine a Marvel or DC superhero in an

163
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,660
ancient culture, what superhero and culture
would you choose? Yeah, this should be a fun one for

164
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,020
you guys. Just let us know, like, what the
character would be like, and how it would affect

165
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:35,640
their origin and or power set. Record your answer

170
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,079
all the news for this episode, so let's go ahead and
move into our main event where we review the latest

171
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:27,720
Marvel Studios film to hit theaters, The
Fantastic Four First Steps. Okay, The Fantastic

172
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:34,140
Four First Steps was directed by Matt Shackman and
stars Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss,

173
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:39,920
Bach Rock, and Joseph Quinn. It is the start of
phase six in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and

174
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,260
it's the second reboot of the franchise in as many
decades. The Fantastic Four have always kind of

175
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:51,280
struggled on the big screen with the earlier
entries under 20th Century Fox being okay to just

176
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:56,780
like fucking downright awful. And the big hurdle
that this latest iteration of the franchise had to

177
00:17:56,780 --> 00:18:03,080
clear was giving fans and audiences an actual
worthwhile story. And in my mind, The Fantastic

178
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:08,320
Four First Steps movie just soared over that
hurdle and gave us not only a movie that's better

179
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,760
than previous attempts, but also one of the best
films that Marvel has ever put out, period. Yeah,

180
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:21,380
doing better than the past attempts was a low bar.
Yeah, totally soared over that, becoming my new

181
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:27,440
favorite Marvel Studios film of all time. And this
is coming right off of Thunderbolts, which was my

182
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,040
previous. They just keep getting better and
better and better. I don't know if it's my favorite

183
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,760
Marvel Studios film of all time, but it's
definitely one of my recent favorites. And I'd

184
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,860
probably put it like in the top five. And that's
pretty high praise considering the quality of

185
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:46,100
some of the movies that Marvel has put out. If you
haven't seen the film, that's really all you need

186
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:51,060
to know. Like what more recommendation do you need
to go out and see it? Like don't spoil this movie for

187
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:56,160
yourself by listening to this review. Go see the
film. There are some wonderful visual and

188
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,280
emotional moments in this movie that you don't
want to ruin the impact of by knowing what happens

189
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:06,100
beforehand. Just trust me. Go see the film, then
come back and listen to this review. Now,

190
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:12,140
Jonathan, you know that I've been a big Fantastic
Four fan for a long time and like it killed me to hear

191
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,920
other people over the years. Like even Marvel fans
say that they think the Fantastic Four are lame.

192
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:22,100
I'm always like, yeah, maybe they haven't had like
the cool factor of the X-Men or Spider-Man or the

193
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:27,380
Avengers and they never really had a good movie,
but they've always had kind of a soft spot in my

194
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:32,100
heart because they're the ones that really
revitalized Marvel comics back in the 1960s under

195
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,220
Stanley and Jack Kirby. Those early books really
captured the fantastical side of like science

196
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:42,240
fiction and had heartfelt character dynamics
that no other comic books at the time were really

197
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:48,560
doing. Yeah, honestly, I don't see how you can't
see the appeal of the Fantastic Four. I've always

198
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:53,560
thought they were interesting back when I liked
Marvel and even when they moved on to DC Comics,

199
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:59,380
they're really kind of the perfect team. Like
they're a more solid team in regards to not only

200
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:04,880
their personalities, but their powers than even a
lot of DC teams like the Justice League. Yeah, they

201
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,760
play well off each other and that's the big appeal.
Their books kind of tapered off for a long time, but

202
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,060
I think that Mark Waits work on them in their early
aughts and then Jonathan Hickman's run in the

203
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:18,640
2010s brought them right back to some of Marvel's
best comic book stories at the time. They're rich

204
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,740
characters, they go on amazing journeys and
because of that, I always knew that their

205
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:29,200
potential on the big screen was massive and I've
just been spending decades waiting for that to

206
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,040
manifest. And I'm thrilled to say that that
potential finally came to fruition. Like if you

207
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:39,440
see this movie and you don't like the Fantastic
Four still, I don't know what to say, there's no

208
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,140
hope for you because this really feels like the
quintessential Fantastic Four movie. Not only

209
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:47,340
did it tell the story of one of the team's greatest
adventures against the coming of Galactus, but it

210
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:52,460
also gave a spot on characterizations of the
heroes from the books and it captured the tone of

211
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:58,380
who the Fantastic Four are. And it also captured
the theme that has been with the Fantastic Four

212
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:05,120
since its inception that family is paramount and
it did it here in a really profound way, I thought.

213
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,620
For sure. Yeah, the Fantastic Four are a family.
They're not, you know, a cheesy band of one

214
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,940
dimensional cartoon characters like in the 2005
franchise and they're not like a reluctant

215
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:19,620
alliance of simple acquaintances and estranged
relatives like in the 2015 franchise. They're a

216
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,960
family in like the strongest sense of the word who
love and protect each other while exploring

217
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,160
what's beyond the unknown. And they're so
versatile, you know, like they can save Manhattan

218
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,280
like the Avengers, but they can also take a journey
to the edge of space like the Guardians of the

219
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:37,620
Galaxy. They can also travel past the edge of time
in reality like Doctor Strange. The fact that they

220
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:42,980
journeyed light years in this movie to talk to a
space god like it was a walk in the park, I think

221
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:47,680
really captured that whimsy from the books in a way
that made it seem like anything was possible. Oh,

222
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:54,840
absolutely. Yeah. The ambition of this film blew
my mind. Like it was much higher than I thought it

223
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,640
was going to be. It was almost like the same
reaction I had to the Pocket Dimension in the

224
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,020
Superman film. It was just very high concept and I
loved that. Yeah, I thought it was fascinating

225
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:09,360
that in the movie they were like, let's go talk to
this galactus guy. Tony Stark wasn't scanning

226
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,600
deep space for Chitauri energy signatures like
you probably should have after the first Avengers

227
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,320
film because he was too busy building the Ultron
program. And yeah, Tony Stark cracked time travel

228
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:24,880
via the Quantum Realm in Avengers Endgame, but
that kind of like out-of-the-box problem solving

229
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,200
was always more of the Fantastic Four's bread and
butter. I'm really glad that they captured that in

230
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,600
this movie. I think another thing that makes the
Fantastic Four as a team so appealing is the

231
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,640
emotional heart of their stories. Like as a
family, they just care about each other a little

232
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,360
bit more as families should. And so when they're in
danger, it hits a little bit harder because you're

233
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,840
going to have more at stake when you're fighting to
protect your sister or your father or whatever

234
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,280
close relative you have as opposed to fighting to
protect like a co-worker or something like that in

235
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,440
the case of the Avengers. And you know, every team
has interpersonal conflict, but when Riden Tsu

236
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,060
argue, it's more like your mom and dad are
fighting. It feels more personal. It's like a

237
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:08,700
whole new set of emotions with family. And I think
the Fantastic Four first steps nailed that

238
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,700
because I felt for these characters. Like when
Franklin was being born as they tried to escape the

239
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:20,000
gravity well, that was like such a beautiful
moment. And when Tsu fucking died, trying to save

240
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,160
her baby, holy shit, like I'm going to tear up again
just thinking about it. And I bawled my eyes out in

241
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:30,280
the theater when that happened. And I don't know if
it's just because I'm a father now and like

242
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,800
becoming a parent kind of rewires your emotions,
but I thought there was a lot to connect to in this

243
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,320
movie in terms of being a new parent. I don't think
any movie I've ever seen has nailed the anxiety of

244
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:45,080
having a newborn quite like this movie did or like
showing the vulnerability of being a new mom or the

245
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:49,440
strength that you muster when it comes to
protecting those you love. This movie just had

246
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:55,360
that in spades. Yeah, I mentioned that the film was
profound, not only in regards to how well it

247
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,960
captured the feeling of being a parent, but also
just in the notion that they were asked to give up

248
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:08,800
their only child to save humanity. It's almost
biblical in proportion. The stakes right off the

249
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,660
bat were so much larger, I think, than your
standard superhero fare and so much more

250
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:20,540
personal, so much more real. 100% the stakes in
this film is how you do stakes in film with

251
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:27,320
superheroes. Like honestly, watching this, I was
like, Superman should have done that. Like the

252
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:32,480
stakes shouldn't have been the city of Metropolis
being destroyed, but the world, because that's a

253
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,860
Superman level threat, in my opinion, and maybe
we'll get down that road in a sequel with like

254
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:42,500
Brainiac or something like that. And I guess I
shouldn't have been surprised that yes, the fate

255
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,860
of the world was in the Fantastic Four's hands
considering the villain was Galactus, but they

256
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:55,140
did such a good job of showing the reaction of the
people and what they expected of the Fantastic

257
00:24:55,140 --> 00:25:00,840
Four and how much faith they put in this team that
yeah, it's like, how could you let all of these

258
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,760
people die? It was a true conundrum and they did it
really. Yeah, it was like a trolley problem, but

259
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:12,120
like on a global scale. Yeah, absolutely. You have
to appreciate a truly epic ethical dilemma like

260
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:17,420
this film, and I wish more superhero films had
something like this. Yeah, it's always neat when

261
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:23,260
the story is dive into the philosophical, right?
It's my favorite part of superhero media. I'll say

262
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:28,360
for as much as I connected with the characters in
this story, it took a while for me to get there

263
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:34,920
because the first act was entirely a montage.
Almost, yeah. The film really struggled to hook me

264
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:39,520
in the first act, actually to the point where I was
like concerned that I wasn't connecting at all

265
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,600
with the heroes, because it's all set up an
exposition and background for like a solid 30 to 40

266
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,620
minutes, I think, until the movie starts its
narrative flow and we settle into the actual story

267
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:54,620
right around the point that they venture into
space to confront Galactus. And that's when you

268
00:25:54,620 --> 00:26:00,260
see the stakes beyond what's just being told to us.
And right after that, you know, we got the birth

269
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:04,900
scene and the press conference scene, and by then I
was like, okay, I'm in. And I really thought that

270
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:11,880
the second and third acts went a long way in saving
the film. Yet, narratively, the plotting of this

271
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:18,380
film is kind of strange because there's so much
that happens offscreen as it were. And then you

272
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:22,540
kind of get these cute little interludes in
between that with the family just kind of

273
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:27,860
reinforcing how much of a family they are. But
yeah, I would agree, the film definitely picked up

274
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:34,100
once they went to go seek Galactus. The first act to
montage was a much different way of introducing

275
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:40,140
audiences to this new universe than say the recent
Superman film, which began with like eight lines

276
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:45,700
of text on the screen and then dove right in. In the
end, I'm not sure what approach worked best

277
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:50,660
because Fantastic Four First Steps felt more
satisfying in terms of worldbuilding, but more

278
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:56,080
clunky in execution, where a Superman felt less
satisfying in terms of worldbuilding. But that

279
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,740
movie was able to get to the story right away. I
don't know what was the right approach, but either

280
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:05,560
way, I don't envy the writers of the film because
it's got to be so hard to get people to forget like

281
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:10,900
some of what they may know from previous franchise
versions of the characters, but still remember

282
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:17,760
some of the things like the origin. Reboots have
got to be so hard in terms of writing because it's

283
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,120
all just a delicate balancing act. Yeah, I mean, I
don't love the fact that we're kind of moving on

284
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:28,300
from origins because I personally love origin
stories. I would have loved to have seen them get

285
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:34,980
bombarded by cosmic radiation. I feel like that
whole thing was sorely missing from this film.

286
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,460
Well, I would have liked to have gotten a scene of
Superman being rocketed to earth from Krypton,

287
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:44,260
but we don't get origin stories anymore,
Jonathan. Fuck! Which, yeah, I agree. I don't like

288
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:50,340
that. But speaking of things that I did not like,
let's talk about Shalabal. If you've listened to

289
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:56,580
this podcast, you'll know that we were never
entirely sold on Shalabal, but like I held out hope

290
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:03,440
that this movie would actually have a good reason
for going with her instead of Norrin Rad, who is the

291
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,940
traditional silver surfer from the comic books.
And this movie never had a reason. The only reason

292
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:16,060
was to make Johnny Storm his kind of classic
playboy ladies man type character. And I don't

293
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:20,960
think that's a solid reason. No, I mean, because
they barely even touched upon that. Like she was a

294
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,460
real love interest for Johnny Storm. They should
have leaned more into that to make the gender swap

295
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:31,780
to Shalabal worth it. But then maybe they also
should have gone with Frankie Ray instead. You

296
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:36,780
know, the Herald known as Nova, who is
romantically tied to Johnny Storm in the comics.

297
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:41,000
And she still would have looked cool too, being
gold instead of silver. That's what I was thinking

298
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,340
the entire movie. I'm just going to imagine this is
Frankie. I mean, beyond the Johnny thing, it's

299
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:53,300
also possible that they were going for like a
motherly theme with the character of Shalabal to

300
00:28:53,300 --> 00:29:00,040
draw a parallel between her sacrifice for Zenlau
and Sue's sacrifice. But I also think that you

301
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:04,280
could have played on that theme with Nora and Rad
just as well, just saying that, you know, as a

302
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:09,920
father, he sacrificed for his daughter and for his
planet. Right. So really, there was no good

303
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:14,380
reason. Marble definitely dropped the ball
there. And it doesn't really negatively affect

304
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:20,580
the movie so much as piss me off as a silver surfer
fan. I don't think fans are happy at all with the

305
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:24,500
fact that they went with Shalabal. And it sucks
because like as soon as Julia Garner was

306
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:30,020
announced, everybody was decrying the choice.
Like they knew better than to do this. And yeah,

307
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:34,260
Julia Garner was fine in the role, but it should
have been Nora and Rad. Because if and when we

308
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:39,700
finally do see him in Earth 616, he's going to feel
redundant, and his best story has already been

309
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:45,820
told. Yes, everything that we were afraid would
happen is going to. Right. And Julia Garner is a

310
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:50,800
good actress. I thought that was the main reason
why they wanted to work with her. Mm-hmm. But it's

311
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:57,300
not like she gave a fantastic performance here.
Like it was pretty by the book, I would say. It was

312
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,220
pretty hidden in the special effects, too.
Absolutely. Yeah, the best parts of the Silver

313
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:08,120
Surfer were seeing her surf different things,
whether it's like a wormhole or a lava wave. Yeah. I

314
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:12,600
loved seeing that. I loved what they did with the
special effects here. Just it could have been

315
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,860
Noren. Right. Imagine how cool it would have been
if it was. Well, I feel like I would have connected

316
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:22,240
with the character more just because I know him
from the comic books. You know, Shalabal was the

317
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:28,140
Silver Surfer for all of a few panels in the Earth-X
graphic novel. But you know, I don't think that's

318
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,820
enough precedent to give the character the
spotlight in a whole movie. But where they went

319
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:37,480
wrong with the Silver Surfer, I am happy to say that
they finally went right with Galactus. Like he's

320
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,440
not a cloud this time for sure, but we'll
definitely talk more about Galactus in our

321
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,420
character breakdown. So let's dive into that,
starting with Mr. Fantastic, aka Reed Richards,

322
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:53,180
played by Pedro Pascal. Prior to seeing the movie,
I was never fully sold on Pedro Pascal as Reed

323
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:58,620
Richards. Like, I knew he'd do fine because he's a
great actor with a general affability that makes

324
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:04,300
him likable in any role he's in. But mostly, I
thought John Krasinski, you know, who played Reed

325
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,320
Richards and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of
Madness, and his wife Emily Blunt would have

326
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,800
crushed these roles without breaking a sweat. And
I really hope they're fucking kicking themselves

327
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:19,740
right now, because Fantastic Four first steps
gave Reed and Sue their greatest arcs yet as they

328
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:24,380
stepped into the world of parenthood. And yeah,
Pedro Pascal did great. You know, he's an

329
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:29,300
inoffensive actor who I think is mostly
believable as the world's greatest mind. But

330
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:34,540
where I think he really shined in this movie was in
his performance of parenthood anxiety. You know,

331
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,900
as he mentions in this film, his mind is constantly
running through worst-case scenarios in order to

332
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,560
be prepared to handle them. And when you're the
father of a potentially genetically altered

333
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:49,200
infant on the world stage where you have multiple
enemies and even more responsibilities, yeah,

334
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,060
there's a lot to worry about. And Pedro Pascal's
performance was full of subtleties. Like, it was

335
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:59,080
really easy to pick up on his internal struggles as
he dealt with the things around him. Yeah, I could

336
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:04,660
have said that better myself. And I think it wasn't
just parental anxiety. I think he's probably

337
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:11,400
suffered from that for a long time. It was almost
like an OCD level of intrusive thoughts of

338
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:17,520
worrying about the worst and just needing
obsessively to find a way to solve that. They

339
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:23,800
captured Reed in this film so much better than any
other films. It's embarrassing. And this is the

340
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:28,880
way the character should have always been. It's a
fantastic take. For sure. It was interesting,

341
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,880
like, as you could tell just by looking at him, that
he knew that the ethical action from, like, a

342
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,340
utilitarian perspective would be to hand over his
only child. But, like, what's great is that Reed is

343
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:43,820
too smart to be bound by such limitations. And I
love how he was always able to think of a solution

344
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:49,700
and adapt to the problem at hand. Whether it was
sucking Silver Surfer down a gravity well or

345
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:54,280
teleporting the earth or, you know, getting
Galactus to walk into a teleporter. He just always

346
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,740
had a solution and that felt very true to character
to me. Yeah, this is the first time I feel like we've

347
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:04,280
seen Mr. Fantastic as a genius over prior films,
because I never really got that sense. He was made

348
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:10,120
up like BS junk science, but like, oh, techie on
pulse and stupid stuff like that. But here he was

349
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:14,940
actually coming up with solutions to problems
that we understood. Yeah, they made sense. You

350
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:20,060
could see his thought process. He didn't try to
flash freeze Galactus by having Johnny goes

351
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:26,280
supernova and then break a fire hydrant and squirt
him with water like chemistry 101 stuff in the 2005

352
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:33,860
Fantastic Four movie. What happens when you super
cool molten metal? One thing that the 2005 movie

353
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:39,320
did get right, though, was the suits. I think I
don't love the suits in Fantastic Four first

354
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:44,960
steps. I don't love the color. I don't love the
material. I don't love the inconsistency in their

355
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,940
uniforms. I know that the film is set in the 1960s
and these outfits are like for sure better than

356
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:56,660
like Adam West's spandex that we saw superheroes
wear in the 1960s. But I do think that there was a

357
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:01,240
better solution to keep the outfits in the time
period and still not make them look like cotton

358
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:07,760
sweatsuits. Yeah, seeing Mr. Fantastic suit rip.
I was like, no, yeah, that shouldn't happen. No,

359
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:13,320
yeah, it's supposed to be unstable molecules. Why
is it ripping like a cotton sweater would? That was

360
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,199
definitely a gripe I had with the movie. And that
pertains to all the members of the Fantastic Four,

361
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:24,940
including Invisible Woman, a.k .a. Sue Storm
Richards, played by Vanessa Kirby. Dude, Vanessa

362
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:33,560
Kirby fucking cooked in this role and she ate. She
cooked and then she ate what she cooked. She was

363
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:39,440
such a good Sue Storm. I don't think I've ever seen
Vanessa Kirby in anything else. Like I knew her

364
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,500
name when she was cast and was generally pleased
with the casting. But I didn't like know that she

365
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:51,659
would fucking embody the character of Invisible
Woman as much as she did. Yeah, I'd seen her in The

366
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:57,200
Crown. The television series. And it was a
completely different performance. She's a

367
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:03,240
really talented actress. I thought she nailed the
emotional strength of Sue, who really is the glue

368
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,280
that binds the team together. I thought she
perfectly encapsulated the power and the grace

369
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,260
and the beauty, but also the vulnerability that
comes with being a new mother and how moms will

370
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:18,300
fucking pull up when they think their kid is in
danger. Yeah, she got pretty aggressive at times,

371
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:23,860
especially with Reed. Actually, I was sitting
next to a lady in the movie theater when I went to see

372
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:29,820
the movie and I heard her lean over to her partner
and say, wow, she's kind of a bitch. That lady could

373
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:34,820
fuck off because like Reed is pulled in a million
different directions, you know, with his

374
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:39,940
anxiety, you know, always thinking of the worst
case scenario, all these responsibilities. Sue

375
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:44,960
is the one that really is always focused on what
truly matters. And that's always been an

376
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,600
interesting dynamic in their relationship and
the comic books. You know, they don't have a

377
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:54,740
relationship where they never argue, but they do
have a perfect compliment in each other. Yeah,

378
00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:00,260
that was clearly evident in this film. I love what
they did with her speech in front of the crowd

379
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:06,520
because I was with Reed. I was like, I mean, I think
you kind of should ethically give up the kid. And I

380
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:11,800
couldn't understand like where she was coming
from in regards to her not wanting to do that or

381
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:17,380
feeling like she just was refusing to do it. And I
was like, come on, be reasonable. But her speech

382
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:22,460
sold me in the same way that I think it sold
everyone. Yeah, I mean, like she didn't give a fuck

383
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,940
about utilitarian ethics. She knew that there was
no way she was even considering handing over her

384
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:31,680
son. And to the rest of the world, yeah, that may
have seemed selfish, but I do think she said it best

385
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,640
when she said, I will not sacrifice my son for this
world, but I will not sacrifice this world for my

386
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,240
son. You know, she had faith in her family that I
thought was on spiring. And, you know, her

387
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:47,100
willingness to sacrifice for that family was tear
jerking. Like I was just amazed by this

388
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:52,520
characterization of Sue. Yeah, ultimately, she
wasn't willing to sacrifice her child, but she was

389
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,200
willing to sacrifice herself. You know, there's
few things sadder in this world than seeing a baby

390
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,900
cry over his dead mom. And yeah, my eyeballs were
really leaking during that last scene,

391
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,380
especially with the wonderful acting
performance of Petra Pascal. Yeah, and Johnny.

392
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,920
Yeah. The thing I'm not so sure about because it was
hard to tell what his emotions were. But let's go

393
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,180
ahead and talk about the thing, a.k .a. Ben Grimm
played by Ebon Moss Bachrock. Ebon Moss Bachrock

394
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:26,140
was in this movie. Don't get me wrong, I like the
guy. I also thought he was a great micro in the

395
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:32,380
Punisher series as well. But his approach to Ben
Grimm in this movie was so low key that it bordered

396
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:37,040
on almost generic. Like the special effects, of
course, did a lot of the heavy lifting, but it was so

397
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:43,440
hard to see Ebon's performance behind the special
effects. Even in those quiet moments where you see

398
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:48,280
Ben's internal struggle in his eyes. I actually
think he needed to go a little bit bigger with his

399
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:53,420
acting to actually have it come through Ben's
rocky exterior. Yeah, he should have been more

400
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:58,660
what's the word I'm looking for? Gruff, I guess.
Yeah, I would agree that I did not see his

401
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:03,960
performance in the role in the same way that you see
Mark Ruffalo's performance in the Hulk or even saw

402
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,520
Michael Chickless's performance in his
interpretation of the thing. Yeah, I mean, the

403
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:14,360
character design was great. But as it was, you
would barely even know the guy had an arc. You know,

404
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:20,260
basically it was that he felt closed off from the
world. And as everything came under threat, he got

405
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:26,100
the push he needed to open up and reconnect with the
world around him, specifically through the

406
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:31,160
Jewish day school teacher, Natasha Leon's
character. And think is a deep character. You

407
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:36,380
know, this whole arc is a far cry from the this man,
this monster story in the comic books where he's

408
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:43,000
like in full self pity mode. And that just makes me
hope that Eben has more to do with the thing in

409
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:48,120
future installments. Yeah, this version of the
thing definitely feels like a psychologically

410
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:53,380
healed version of the thing. Yeah, like they
didn't really delve into the self pity that the

411
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:58,460
character is known for. Right. So you kind of lost
the tragedy of the thing, which I thought has

412
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:02,760
always been the most interesting thing about the
character. Yeah, I mean, they kind of touched upon

413
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,480
it. And like you saw more of Reed dealing with his
guilt regarding Ben's appearance, then you saw

414
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,100
Ben worry about his own appearance. You know, that
was a little bit weird. It was like Ben reassuring

415
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:17,920
Reed about the situation. Usually it's the other
way around. I said that the character design was

416
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,400
great, but I do have to ask what the fuck was up with
the thing's beard? Like, is that something I'm

417
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,000
just going to have to get used to now? Because fuck
that. It wasn't just the beard. He was growing hair

418
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,600
on his head. And I was like, why is this necessary? I
don't know. Like he grew it because of the world

419
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:39,300
energy conservation efforts for the
teleportation machines, but like those efforts

420
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:44,160
were just temporary. Right. Like, did he end up
keeping the beard just because Johnny said it

421
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,540
looked good? And like, was Johnny fucking with him
when he said that? And if so, where was the payoff

422
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:54,260
where he made fun of him for keeping the beard? I
have so many questions when it comes to the thing

423
00:39:54,260 --> 00:40:00,900
manscaping and none of them are fun to ask. And all I
know is that the beard has got to fucking go. I was so

424
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:06,040
disappointed that he didn't have his classic look
for the film's climax or even by the film's end.

425
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,260
Yeah, I guess the beard is going to have to carry
over into Avengers Doomsday, which better not.

426
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:16,240
Yeah, it better not. I'm convinced that the thing
should never grow rock hair. Like that's just not a

427
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,100
thing that should happen. Weird choice for sure.
Let's go ahead and move on to the human torch, aka

428
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:26,400
Johnny Storm, played by Joseph Quinn. I thought
Joseph Quinn was a solid Johnny Storm, but more

429
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,260
than his performance, I appreciated the
characterization of Johnny here. Like, sure, it

430
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:36,300
wasn't as funny as Chris Evans' role, but it did
feel more real. Like Johnny is a ladies man in the

431
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,980
comic books, but I wouldn't say that's his
defining trait. Like to me, Johnny was always an

432
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,760
adventurous, immature, mechanic with his heart
always in the right place who could just never

433
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,560
really settle down. I think they captured most of
that in this movie. And Joseph Quinn seemed

434
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,360
entirely capable of taking on even more
substantial work in the future if the story calls

435
00:40:55,360 --> 00:41:00,980
for it. They definitely made him smarter in this
film than he has been depicted in past films, and it

436
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:05,140
kind of makes sense because Reed was saying, you
know, I'm going up into space with the smartest

437
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:10,500
people I know. And if they didn't make him smart,
I'd be questioning why Johnny was a part of that

438
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:15,580
team. Yeah, they made him maybe a little bit too
smart because I could understand Johnny being a

439
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:21,860
skilled mechanic, but I can't understand him
being a skilled Xenolinguist. Right. That just

440
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:28,000
made no sense to me. But his attempt to connect with
the Silver Surfer did lead to a change of heart that

441
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,980
ultimately saved the day. And that was a good
culmination of his arc in that he was yearning for

442
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:38,100
adventure. You know, he was wanting to go back into
space, trying to get new spacesuits made and

443
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:42,120
looking into outer space transmission
recordings. I think the Silver Surfer really

444
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:47,100
filled that void that he had at the start. And maybe
that's why he was so motivated to get to know her

445
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:51,800
language. Right. Yeah. I think that was pretty
explicit that he wanted to get to learn her

446
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:57,880
language because he was attracted to her. You
know, it was just his driving force, I think. On a

447
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:03,780
small note, I'll say that Joseph Queen does look
more like Invisible Woman's brother more than any

448
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:09,560
of the previous film adaptations. I know like they
had Kate Mara be adopted in the Fantaphore stick

449
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:13,760
movie, but I didn't think Chris Evans looked
anything like Jessica Alba. I could kind of see

450
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,740
where Joseph Queen could resemble Vanessa Kirby.
I could kind of see where Joseph Queen resembles

451
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:25,640
Robert Danny, Jr. What? Yeah, I heard someone say
that he looked like the splitting image of Robert

452
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:30,820
Danny, Jr. when he was younger. And when I was
watching the film, I actually couldn't unsee it.

453
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:36,060
Like even with his mannerisms, it's pretty spot
on. Never say that out loud again. Like I don't want

454
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:41,940
to get stuck with that in my head. It's it's true.
Like if they were ever going to recast Tony Stark,

455
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:47,320
maybe like DHM, Joseph Queen would have made a good
one. You would have, but he can't know. Hey, it's

456
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:51,360
the multiverse. Anything is possible. Yeah,
which is not always a good thing. Let's go ahead and

457
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:56,000
move on to Galactus, who was played by Ralph
Inneson. There's not too much to discuss here

458
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,000
regarding Guinness's performance because it was
largely hidden under the special effects and that

459
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:08,440
helmet. But I got to say that the design of Galactus
was inspired. He looked so damn cool in this movie.

460
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:13,520
Like why did they ever make him a cloud in the Fox
films? Because the creative potential to render

461
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:19,620
this space God on the screen visually is such a
great opportunity and they totally seized on it in

462
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:23,740
this film. He looked badass like when his eyes
would light up and stuff like that. Oh, it was so

463
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:31,100
good. It was perfect. It was absolute sheer
perfection. And I really wish we would have seen

464
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:37,040
this version of Galactus before we saw like any
celestials. Yeah, that's interesting regarding

465
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,760
the celestials because, you know, this movie
never touched on why Galactus hungers for

466
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:48,420
planets. In the comic books, it's insinuated that
he eats planets as part of some universal balance.

467
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:55,020
And in Earth X, they explained that the celestials
would seed life on planets as a means to protect the

468
00:43:55,020 --> 00:44:01,120
celestial embryo growing at the core and that
Galactus served as a sort of check on the celestial

469
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:06,400
population. And considering that they did
address that there was a celestial growing inside

470
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:11,820
of Earth 616 in the Eternals movie, I thought it
would have been interesting if they addressed

471
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:17,880
Galactus's cosmic purpose here. I'm honestly
really hoping that Reed accidentally teleported

472
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:22,560
Galactus to the 616 universe, although I guess
that would mean Silver Surfer went with him. Never

473
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:28,380
mind, I take it back. I just hope eventually we get
to see Galactus again one day. That would be cool

474
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:34,060
for sure. I do want to touch on one other character
real quick. I'm going to state it right off the bat.

475
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:38,820
I don't like Herbie. I thought he was annoying in
the movie. Is it because I said crypto was

476
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:45,280
annoying? Like every time he was not on screen, I
was really off. Herbie was a total scene stealer,

477
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:50,180
but like in the wrong way. You just got to get over
the fact that crypto sucks and that I hate him.

478
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:55,300
Don't take it out on Herbie. It's totally innocent
in this situation. I also hate Herbie. How does

479
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:00,420
that feel? No one does. No one does. It would feel
bad if I believed you, but I don't. Let's go ahead

480
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:12,020

488
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:03,200
Earth 828, Reed Richards and Sue Storm learned
their pregnant on the fourth anniversary of the

489
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:08,980
day they were bombarded by cosmic rays while on a
mission in space. The world celebrates them and

490
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:13,140
Ben Grimm and Johnny Storm as superheroes and
recounts their efforts protecting the planet

491
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:18,000
from villains such as the Red Ghost, and their
diplomatic efforts such as garnering federal

492
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,280
rights for the Mole Man and Subterranean. That
night, during their weekly dinner, Reed and Sue

493
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,180
reveal the pregnancy to Ben and Johnny, and the
four begin preparing for the baby's arrival over

494
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:33,620
the next few months. Reed conducts tests on Sue to
determine if their cosmically altered DNA has

495
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:37,860
affected the baby. He also meets with Johnny
regarding their suit designs while testing a

496
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:42,560
teleportation machine and recording deep space
transmissions. The robot assistant Herbie

497
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:47,440
baby-proofs the house while Ben meets a friendly
teacher at a Jewish day school. One night before

498
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,860
dinner, the Silver Surfer arrives to herald the
coming of Galactus who will soon devour the Earth.

499
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:57,900
Reed tracks the Surfer's energy signature to the
disappearance of a half a dozen planets, and the

500
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:04,840
team decides to meet Galactus in space. Now that
was a lot, but that was all mostly told in montage.

501
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:10,560
Dude, yeah, that was way too much. That was like the
whole first third of this movie. There was a lot to

502
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:16,020
get through. Interestingly, a lot of little
tidbits and Easter eggs thrown into the montage,

503
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:20,800
like references to Red Ghost and Mole Man. We got to
see the team fight Giganto as their very first

504
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:26,740
villain, which was true to the comic books, as we
can all see on the very first cover to the very first

505
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:32,020
issue of The Fantastic Four. Which is a total
ripoff of Justice League of America number one. I

506
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,520
just want to say that. There were a lot of nice
touches here, I thought. Like the Future

507
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:41,000
Foundation, which is like their philanthropic
science foundation in the comic books, but here

508
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:45,660
they made it more like a diplomatic type
organization. So they were affecting the planet,

509
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:50,800
not just through their super heroics and their
inventions, but also through like politics. It

510
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,940
was all pretty interesting. Yeah, Sue was pretty
much a politician in this film the way it came

511
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:00,300
across. She was like a UN ambassador. Well, yeah,
that's what it seemed like the Future Foundation

512
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:06,780
was to me, was the UN. And it almost seemed like The
Fantastic Four were the head of the UN. Not the

513
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:11,500
head, because that one lady was the CEO, but they
definitely helped facilitate it. And like

514
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:15,700
apparently the country of Latveria never showed
up to their gatherings, which I thought was like a

515
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:20,640
funny little Easter egg too. Well, it just made me
wonder where Dr. Doom was during this whole thing.

516
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:26,680
Like, I don't think he would have been OK with The
Fantastic Four's actions in this film. Like, if

517
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:31,320
anyone would have had an issue with The Fantastic
Four willing to sacrifice, essentially, the

518
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:36,500
entire planet for their son, it would have been Dr.
Doom. Well, if I had to play devil's advocate,

519
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:41,960
knowing the character of Dr. Doom, he probably
would have been mostly focused on why Galactus

520
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:46,240
would want their baby, which was a question that
the rest of the world wasn't really asking. Yeah,

521
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,160
not even read and sue themselves. Well, they
didn't know. But Doom would have definitely put

522
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:56,400
his resources to work on figuring out why and then
probably just try to steal the kid for himself or

523
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:02,120
usurp his power. And I think that's exactly what's
going on in the midcredits scene of this movie.

524
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:06,660
That's fair. What did you think of the way they did
the Mole Man? Like, it wasn't really Mole

525
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:13,900
Creatures. It was like under grand construction
workers. Don't get me started on Mole Man. I hated

526
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:19,180
Mole Man in this movie. What really annoyed me was
that when he was on screen, a lot of people in the

527
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:23,700
theater were laughing, even though I didn't think
he was doing anything funny. Like, I always

528
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:28,040
thought the perfect Mole Man actor would be like
Danny DeVito or something. I always thought Mole

529
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:33,600
Man should be wearing rags and not really be well
dressed and wearing gold rings and stuff like

530
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:37,850
that. It was a very different take on the character
that I wasn't entirely pleased with. Yeah, I

531
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:42,340
suspected it as much. I don't really care too much
about the character, but I'm not surprised that

532
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:47,540
fans of the comic didn't care for the
interpretation. Some might. I don't know. To me,

533
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:51,900
Mole Man is just a very different character from
the books that I read him in. Red Ghost was in the

534
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,700
movie, though, for a little bit. Originally, he
was played by John Malkovich, but they cut him out

535
00:49:55,700 --> 00:50:01,880
of the film and then they just got some random guy or
maybe he was a CGI creation. I don't know. I thought

536
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:06,180
that was a little weird. I knew that Natasha Leone
was going to be in this movie. I wasn't sure who she

537
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:09,200
was going to play. I thought maybe she was going to
be, I don't know, some kind of gender swapped

538
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:14,220
villain or something like that. But I was
surprised that she wasn't Alicia Masters. She was

539
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:21,140
like this random original character to the movie
who taught at a Jewish day school and seemed to be

540
00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:25,620
romantically interested in the thing. I don't
know really what was behind her character. Yeah, I

541
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:30,520
don't really think any of that was needed in the
movie. It was really just a way to give more screen

542
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:36,460
time to the thing, I think. I think so. They needed
to give him something to do. So they had him like go

543
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:41,260
on these frequent walks through Yancy Street.
Back to the story. Venturing through a wormhole

544
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:45,900
device, the Fantastic Four followed the surfer's
energy signature to a distant planet and

545
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:50,900
witnessed its destruction. Pulled into
Galactus' ship via a tractor beam, the team learns

546
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:56,300
that Galactus is a cosmic being who feeds on the
life force of planets but is willing to spare Earth

547
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:01,480
in exchange for Reed and Sue's son, sensing
immense power within him and believing he can

548
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:07,800
transfer his hunger into the boy. He induces Sue to
go into labor as the team escapes back into the ship

549
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,800
with the silver surfer in pursuit. They
temporarily lose her in the gravity of a neutron

550
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:19,180
star as Sue gives birth to baby Franklin and they
return home. There are a lot of terrifying scenes

551
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:24,780
in the sequence, which was a fantastic sequence.
Like when the scanner was going across the ship and

552
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:30,200
then settled on Sue's belly, I was like, oh, crap.
Yeah. And then seeing the planet explode and stuff

553
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:36,440
like that. That was incredible. That was insane.
The scale of that planet exploding with this drill

554
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:42,080
coming out of it did such a good job of setting the
stakes of what could happen to Earth. The team lost

555
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:47,320
their minds. They were like, what the fuck? I
thought that was great. I also thought the silver

556
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:53,420
surfer was a really effective villain in this
scene when she was chasing their light speed ship.

557
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:57,160
You know, they thought they lost her by going into
the wormhole. But then all of a sudden she went into

558
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:01,180
the wormhole. I remember my wife was like, holy
shit. When she saw that because she doesn't really

559
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:05,060
know that the silver surfer can traverse the
galaxy at light speed. But yeah, that whole thing

560
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:10,020
was a lot of fun. Yeah, she was like Michael Myers.
There's just no stopping her, no escaping her. She

561
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:15,260
was like the terminator. She was like T1000. Oh,
yeah. Yeah, exactly. Although I have to say I was

562
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:21,100
really confused what happened near that black
hole because she was like chasing the ship and then

563
00:52:21,100 --> 00:52:27,340
she like saw the ship get destroyed or something.
And then it turns out that wasn't true. How did that

564
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:33,480
happen? They turned the ship invisible and had her
follow the light speed engine portion to the point

565
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:39,040
where she got too close to the gravity well. So that
was all Sue's doing. OK, she saw the light speed

566
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:44,300
engine. Wait, didn't they need that to get back to
Earth? They were still able to approach near light

567
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:52,060
speed with their ship without the assistance of
the external engine. OK, makes sense. I guess so.

568
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:59,500
The scene where Sue gave birth to Franklin was so
tense. I don't know, it just felt very real. And it

569
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:04,220
kind of reminded me of like the tension that I felt
in the delivery room when my wife was giving birth

570
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:10,680
to our daughter. Yeah, I loved it when Sue was like,
Johnny, killer. Yeah, that was nuts. Back to the

571
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,820
story. After revealing the situation to the
press, the public turns against the team

572
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:18,800
believing they should give up their baby to
protect the planet. The Fantastic Four work on

573
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:24,220
finding a solution to stop Galactus and read in Sue
argue over potentially handing over their child.

574
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:29,080
Sue reinstills public trust by ensuring they will
move heaven and earth to protect the planet, which

575
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:34,220
inspires Reed to use his teleportation device to
relocate Earth and the team rallies the world to

576
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:39,320
build teleportation towers across the globe.
However, those towers are destroyed just upon

577
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:44,420
activation by the Silver Surfer who returns to the
planet. Johnny stops her from wrecking the final

578
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:49,960
tower in Times Square by playing for her the cries
of destroyed planets from Reed's deep space

579
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:55,040
transmission recordings, having deciphered the
Zen law language. Johnny reveals he knows of

580
00:53:55,040 --> 00:54:00,460
Shalabal's sacrifice to protect her planet and
pleads for her help in stopping Galactus as she

581
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:07,580
flees in anguish. I was really surprised how
honest Reed was with the world. Like, he didn't

582
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:12,500
have to tell them everything that happened, like
how Galactus wanted their son. Yeah, I think it

583
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:18,580
would be entirely reasonable for someone to
withhold that information from the earth. Yeah,

584
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:23,040
and I don't know why he told the truth. I guess he's
just a really good guy or maybe it just slipped out.

585
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,920
I don't know. But yeah, I probably would have kept
that to myself. I'm no Reed Richards, though.

586
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,260
Moving back to the story, now planning to lure
Galactus into the final teleporter using

587
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:38,040
Franklin as bait, the team relocates Manhattan to
subterrania with help from the Mole Man. When

588
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:43,240
Galactus arrives, he avoids their trap and
snatches the baby from the Baxter building. Sue

589
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:48,380
uses her powers in an attempt to push Galactus into
the tower and succeeds with help from the thing

590
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:53,240
knocking down a building. Reed rescues the baby
from Galactus's grasp, though the cosmic being

591
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:58,140
proves too powerful to be held in the portal. As
Johnny prepares to sacrifice himself to push

592
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:03,140
Galactus back in, the Silver Surfer arrives and
knocks her master into the beam, teleporting them

593
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:08,460
both to the edge of the universe. Sue collapses and
dies from her efforts. However, baby Franklin

594
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:14,940
revives her with his awakened cosmic powers when
placed on her chest. I got to say, power scale wise,

595
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:21,680
I was a little miffed that Sue was so successful in
pushing Galactus, which I don't think she should

596
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:27,620
ever really be able to do. She's not that strong.
She definitely had like mom power going for her

597
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:33,720
within this climax. But I do think that the script
was able to rectify that situation by, you know,

598
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:38,760
having her die from her efforts. That kind of
seemed to make it a little bit more OK from a power

599
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:44,880
scaling perspective. I did question why everyone
needed to go to subterranean when they could have

600
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:51,620
just left the city like they did in Metropolis in
the Superman movie. I guess that's true. Yeah,

601
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:56,080
they could have just traveled to Jersey, you know,
Manhattan has a big population, but there's

602
00:55:56,080 --> 00:56:00,940
plenty of bridges to go elsewhere. Boats, I don't
think they necessarily needed to go underground.

603
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:06,160
That almost seemed more dangerous. Like I'm
pretty sure Galactus is heavy enough to crush some

604
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,240
tunnels. I don't know that New York bedrock
supposedly pretty sturdy. I was actually shocked

605
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:16,720
when Sue died because I didn't see how they were
going to resurrect her and I was like, wait, what is

606
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,960
Sue actually going to die? For some reason, I
didn't make the connection to Franklin's reality

607
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:27,920
warping powers being given her back. Yeah, my
first thought was, oh, maybe they're going to have

608
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:33,400
a multiversal Sue join the team later. But then
once the baby entered the frame, I was like, OK,

609
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:39,160
yeah, he's going to bring his mom back. It was just a
beautiful moment. Yeah, great climax, great

610
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:45,880
stakes again. This film had so many surprises. I
was so happy with it by the end. Back to the story.

611
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:50,980
The team is celebrated for their victory and rides
off for another adventure in their fantastic car

612
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:57,280
with Franklin along with them in a car seat. Four
years later in 1968, Sue finds Dr. Doom holding

613
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:02,020
Franklin in an after credit scene. We see the
opening to the fantastic fours in universe

614
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:07,940
cartoon. I loved the kind of three man and a baby
approach they took to getting the car seat in the

615
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:12,960
fantastic car with Ben, Johnny and Reed all trying
to do it. I thought that was really funny. Those

616
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:19,060
things are not easy to get in. They are not. They are
complex pieces of engineering. Let me tell you

617
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:25,340
that. So I had a good chuckle at that. But like I felt
like the air leave my lungs during the mid credit

618
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:30,800
scene when Sue returned back to see Franklin and
there was this green hooded figure holding him.

619
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:36,620
There was such a good cliffhanger and tease for
what's to come. Yeah, it looks like Franklin got to

620
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:42,620
take a peek at Dr. Doom's real face. He's like, oh,
you look just like my uncle. No, he would never say

621
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:48,040
that. He would never say that. It wouldn't even
enter his mind. It is interesting to see how

622
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:52,780
Franklin would play into Dr. Dooms plans. I think
they're going to substitute the beyonders from

623
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:57,280
the comic books with Franklin Richards. I think
he's going to be the catalyst for Dr. Dooms

624
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:03,140
universal reality warping that ends the
incursions and forms battle world. That's my

625
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:09,500
theory. One nitpicky sticking point I had during
the mid credit scene, though, was that Herbie

626
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:15,620
offered the origin of species by Darwin as
potential reading for Franklin Richards. But

627
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:19,860
Franklin Richards has never been particularly
bright. You know, he's just a normal kid. It's his

628
00:58:19,860 --> 00:58:25,500
sister, Valeria Richards. That's the prodigy.
And I immediately became concerned that they were

629
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:31,940
going to combine the characters of Franklin and
Valeria and make Franklin a prodigy like his

630
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:37,400
father. Well, hey, if Johnny could decipher alien
languages, Franklin can freaking read origin of

631
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:43,620
species. Whatever. All right. Everyone's a
genius. Did you like the end credit scene? No, I

632
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:49,600
mean, it was a waste of time. It was not more so than
like the Superman end credit scene. But the song

633
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:54,520
was OK. It wasn't anything special. The score as a
whole was special. Yeah, the music was good in this

634
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:59,600
film. I'm going to disagree with you about the
Superman end credits scene because you're

635
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:04,960
completely wrong. Hearing Superman saying, man,
I could be such a jerk sometimes. Just showed how

636
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:09,460
humble he was. No, that was stupid. Way to turn the
conversation towards Superman and your

637
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:13,680
Fantastic Four review. Yeah. And how it's
inferior is what I'm doing, because Fantastic

638
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:18,120
Four was definitely the better movie. It had
everything really that I ever wanted from a

639
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:23,900
Fantastic Four film, even beyond the retro
visuals and the cast chemistry. I thought the film

640
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:30,200
most importantly leaned into the emotional core
of the story, which is the team's familial bond,

641
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:36,560
and it did it with sincerity and real stakes. I'm
going to rate the film four and a half stars out of

642
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:44,320
five. A fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Yeah,
I'll agree with that. I really enjoyed this film a

643
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:51,960
lot more than I wanted to. I went to this wanting to
really dislike this movie and just I just wanted to

644
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:57,120
trash on it and be like, oh, Superman is so much
better. I can't really say that. I enjoyed both of

645
00:59:57,120 --> 01:00:02,700
the movies immensely. It is kind of refreshing to
have a series of superhero movies that really

646
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:09,220
focuses more on like hope and the lighthearted
nature of these stories. There's a lot of

647
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:13,600
parallels between the Fantastic Four and
Superman. And I think it's signaling that people

648
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:19,520
are kind of over the sort of cynical cloud that has
been permeating society, I feel like, for a good

649
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:27,140
long while now. Yeah, I wonder if we're maybe past
the whole dark era of superhero films. These two

650
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:32,000
films, Superman and Fantastic Four First Steps.
One of the things I like most about them is their

651
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:38,680
messages, like you mentioned, being kind, family
is paramount. Those are great messages to hear

652
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:44,620
from superheroes. And the Thunderbolts, too, you
know, they're like, don't do meth. Group hug,

653
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:49,680
everyone. Let's do it. Like everyone. I don't know
what Captain America Brave New World's message

654
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:54,540
was, but maybe that's why it's been the weakest out
of the superhero films released this year so far.

655
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:58,440
It's still a decent movie, though. Go listen to
that review if you haven't already. But that does

656
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:06,000
it for this review. AJ and IK help close us out.

next episode is going to be another review. We are

662
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:42,000
going to talk about Sandman Season 2. Now, Season 1
of Sandman was killer. Season 2, I'm almost

663
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,800
certain, will be uncomfortable to watch due to the
Neil Gaiman revelations that have come out

664
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:51,380
between the seasons. I'm not even thinking about
that as I'm watching it. I'm actually really

665
01:01:51,380 --> 01:01:58,000
loving Season 2. I'm only halfway through it, but
damn, it is so good. I'm just taking the time to

666
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,600
relish each and every episode because I know I'm
going to be frigging heartbroken when it's over.

667
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:06,320
Yeah, I got to binge it. I'm just going to I'm just
going to speed watch it while also being on my
