00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,963
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:28,376
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:28,716 --> 00:00:33,259
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters and stat-based

4
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:39,403
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother Johnny DC. And in this episode

5
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:44,706
we're going to find out who would win in a fight
between Kite Man and Stilt Man because I know

6
00:00:45,006 --> 00:00:49,629
everybody is wondering who would win. I have
been wondering about this for as long as...

7
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,873
A couple of months, ever since one of our executive
producers, Mickey Methangean, thought up the

8
00:00:54,973 --> 00:00:59,537
idea. It's a fantastic idea. I can't believe
we haven't thought of it sooner, and I can't

9
00:00:59,617 --> 00:01:03,240
wait to find out who's gonna win. Yeah, this
episode is a tie-in to our next episode, which

10
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:09,405
is gonna be a review of Kite Man Hell Yeah Season
1 on Macs. This should be a fun one though,

11
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:12,828
so look forward to that discussion later. Before
that, we're gonna break down the latest comic

12
00:01:12,868 --> 00:01:19,033
book movie news to come out this past week,
including the Joker Follyadoo That's Life trailer.

Pip pip cheerio. Thanks AJ9K and thanks to

24
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:22,321
everyone who supports the podcast. We want to
give a quick shout out to one of our patrons,

25
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:27,976
Jacob Foster. Whose birthday was this past week?
Happy birthday, Jacob. Happy birthday. If I

26
00:02:27,996 --> 00:02:33,700
could give you any gift from Marvel, I would
give you Gambit's playing card deck because

27
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:37,923
even though you don't have mutant powers to
make them explode, you can still play cards

28
00:02:37,943 --> 00:02:42,547
with them. So yeah, it's fun. If I could get
you anything from DC for your birthday, I would

29
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:50,032
get you Ragman's cloak because your handle in
our Discord server is Hypnotic Cape and that's

30
00:02:50,092 --> 00:02:55,127
pretty much a Hypnotic Cape. Happy birthday
again, man, and thanks for being a patron.

31
00:02:55,427 --> 00:02:59,689
Yeah, thanks a bunch. Be sure to tune into the
other shows on the DynaMic Podcast Network

34
00:03:09,113 --> 00:03:15,075
Robocop vs. Terminator matchup. On the Send

on fights between fan favorite anime and manga
characters. This Thursday... Zach will find

Mashly. On the Console Combat podcast hosts
Jon and Dean simulate battles between popular

38
00:03:31,167 --> 00:03:36,651
video game characters. In yesterday's episode,
they released their first ever developer interview

to the No Prize! A No Prize is an award Marvel

42
00:03:56,184 --> 00:04:01,627
used to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic
Duel No Prize, is a digital award that we post

43
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:06,289
on Instagram for the person that we feel gave
the best answer to our question of the week.

44
00:04:06,869 --> 00:04:13,032
Last week, we asked, Do you think this should
or shouldn't be Eddie Brock's and Venom's last

45
00:04:13,072 --> 00:04:19,607
appearance in Sony's Spider-Man universe, and
why? And that was in reference to the Venom

46
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:23,330
The Last Dance movie. We got a lot of answers.
Let's go ahead and break down our honorable

47
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:29,334
mentions as well as the no prize winner. Our
first honorable mention goes to Scott Camacho.

48
00:04:29,654 --> 00:04:37,459
Who said? Probably channeling my twin brother
through me and the Marvel is coming out. This

49
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:46,045
should be their last appearance in the Sonyverse.
Why? Because it's going nowhere. You guys want

50
00:04:46,105 --> 00:04:53,081
him in... the Spider-Man and Disney side, right?
So yeah, they should end their last dance and

51
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:59,246
hop over there. For sure, yeah. Similar to how
Spider-Man allegedly kind of straddles between

52
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:03,649
the Sony Spider-Man universe and the MCU, even
though that's not really the case because Spider-Man

53
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:09,272
only shows up in the MCU films, maybe Sony and
Marvel can make a deal for Venom so that he

54
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:15,677
can also show up with the other MCU characters
and no longer be confined to this Sony verse

55
00:05:15,757 --> 00:05:21,116
limbo that he's in. Yeah, otherwise like Scotty
said, it's leading nowhere. It does make sense

56
00:05:21,156 --> 00:05:26,939
for Venom to be in the Spider-Man universe considering
he's a Spider-Man character. I guess a good

57
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:31,341
question is what do you consider the Spider-Man
universe? Well, the MCU, the universe that

58
00:05:31,561 --> 00:05:36,424
the Spider-Man character exists in. Okay, okay.
Great answer Scotty. Our next honorable mention

59
00:05:36,464 --> 00:05:41,655
goes to Travis Herndon, who said... What's up,
Dunnaamadoos? Travis here, shout out to my

60
00:05:41,695 --> 00:05:47,180
evil twin. So my answer would be yes. Why? Because
it's finally time for this man to come home.

61
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,485
Home. Eddie and Venom need to be in the MCU.
Me and you. Everybody and their grandmas want

62
00:05:53,525 --> 00:05:59,870
these two to be in the MCU. Finally meet Spider-Man.
Team up with him. Fight him. We don't care.

63
00:06:00,671 --> 00:06:06,336
It's time for this guy to leave the loser table
and come join and sit with the cool kids now.

64
00:06:06,836 --> 00:06:12,235
If they made a fourth Venom movie. with Tom
Hardy and brought him into the MCU. What do

65
00:06:12,255 --> 00:06:15,776
you think the name of that movie should be called?
Should it be called Venom Homecoming? Ha ha

66
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:20,817
ha. Venom, there's no place like home. That
sounds a little bit more apt according to the

67
00:06:20,857 --> 00:06:25,879
naming conventions that they've been going with
for this Venom Sony franchise. Just like dumb?

68
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:32,681
Yeah, exactly. Ha ha ha. Great answer, Travis.
Our next honorable mention goes to Cyrus Moore.

69
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:38,920
Who said? Hey guys, Cyrus Moore here. Um, I
believe the only answer to this question is

70
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:45,084
yes. They are absolutely wasting Tom Hardy's
time. He needs to come back to DC where he'll

71
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:51,448
be treated with the love and care and respect
of the world-class actor he is. Um, I mean,

72
00:06:51,548 --> 00:06:57,052
obviously Sony doesn't know how to make a movie.
Marvel would just waste his time. So he needs

73
00:06:57,072 --> 00:07:03,957
to come back to DC already. Yeah. Tom Hardy's
turn as Bane was a tour de force. Like you

74
00:07:03,977 --> 00:07:10,092
can make fun of it. But the fact that he was
able to pull that off and be almost unrecognizable

75
00:07:10,212 --> 00:07:18,117
as he did it is just a testament to how solid
of an actor he is. I was born in the shadows.

76
00:07:21,254 --> 00:07:25,978
Yeah he was, yeah he was. I'm sure there are
a lot of roles that Tom Hardy could pull off

77
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:31,442
in the new DCU considering you know he's a bigger
guy and he's a big name but I think a lot more

78
00:07:31,482 --> 00:07:36,125
people would want him to come to the Marvel
universe just because people know that Marvel

79
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:43,170
is better. So no one knows that. Kevin Feige
could easily recast Eddie Brock for the MCU

80
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:48,042
so you don't know what you're talking about.
Like fans would not even care. Well, who would

81
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:55,266
you cast Tom Hardy as in the DCU? Ooh, good
question. Would Tom Hardy make a good Constantine?

82
00:07:56,027 --> 00:08:02,510
Oh shit, probably. Yeah, probably would. I could
see that, totally. Just like a chain smoking

83
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:07,433
foul mouthed magician just to make his hair
like dirty blonde and messy. Totally, I could

84
00:08:07,493 --> 00:08:12,576
see that. He gives off heavy vibes of like,
don't give a fuck, you know? Yeah. That's actually

85
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:17,163
pretty solid. Great answer, Cyrus Moore. We
want to give a quick shout out to Daniel Alonzo

86
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:22,226
for also taking the time to visit our website
and record an answer. But the winner of this

87
00:08:22,246 --> 00:08:27,509
week's No Prize is Mason Thompson. Who said?
This is Mason Thompson again, you know, I just

88
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:34,794
gotta keep these answers going. Um, I do feel
like he's a good actor for the thing he, for

89
00:08:34,854 --> 00:08:39,917
the movie. He took a good funny approach to
Venom, but I feel like he got dragged through

90
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:44,311
the mud in the second one. But it'd also be
cool to see him, whatever they do with the

91
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:48,612
Sonyverse. I feel like the Sonyverse is kind
of in shambles. So I feel like if they get

92
00:08:48,632 --> 00:08:53,254
rid of Venom, it's just going to go all down
the drain, you know. Yeah, Mason was the only

93
00:08:53,555 --> 00:08:58,817
responder who said that maybe Venom and Eddie
Brock should stay in Sony's Spider-Man universe

94
00:08:59,117 --> 00:09:03,339
and have another movie. We're not saying we
necessarily agree, but we did think that his

95
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:09,061
answer was unique in the argument that it gave.
It's highly likely due to the deals that Sony

96
00:09:09,101 --> 00:09:14,616
keeps making with Marvel. that Sony is going
to retain the rights for Spider-Man pretty

97
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:19,779
much indefinitely. So if the Sony Spider-Man
universe is going to forever be a thing without

98
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:24,762
the Venom films, it'll likely fall into shambles.
Is that something that we want? Yes, 100%,

99
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:31,987
absolutely. But is it something that is good
for the superhero genre as a whole and will

100
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:37,222
it eventually lead to Sony selling the rights
to Marvel? Probably not. Yeah, there's still

101
00:09:37,262 --> 00:09:41,745
always the option that Andrew Garfield could
come in and be the Spider-Man for Tom Hardy.

102
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:47,269
You know, so I could see them continuing this
universe and not necessarily transferring Kim

103
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:53,132
to the MCU. And it could still end up good,
like good in a way that fans feel is good.

104
00:09:53,573 --> 00:09:58,496
At this point, anything still possible? We'll
see how Venom the Last Dance performs at the

105
00:09:58,516 --> 00:10:03,149
box office and let the conjecture go from there.
But congrats again to Mason Thompson for winning

106
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:07,477
this week's No Prize. If you the listener want
a shot at winning your own No Prize, stay tuned

107
00:10:07,497 --> 00:10:11,485
to later on this episode when we'll be asking
another Question of the Week. And now that

108
00:10:11,525 --> 00:10:13,449
that's done, on to the news!

109
00:10:18,926 --> 00:10:26,291
Okay, this past week we got a new trailer for
Joker Folly do the sequel to 2019's Joker film.

110
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:32,355
I'm not sure if this is the final trailer. It
probably is since the movie comes out pretty

111
00:10:32,395 --> 00:10:37,118
soon here in just a couple of weeks actually.
I would consider this definitely to be a hey

112
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:42,081
tickets are now on sale. Here's where all the
critics are raving about type trailer. So yeah,

113
00:10:42,402 --> 00:10:47,905
it's akin to a final trailer. And I thought
it was a fantastic trailer. I liked this trailer.

114
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:53,462
more than the last trailer that we got. I would
agree. Yeah. Actually, you know, what's interesting

115
00:10:53,502 --> 00:10:58,286
is the first time I watched this trailer, I
was at work and so I couldn't watch it with

116
00:10:58,326 --> 00:11:03,810
the audio on. And it just struck me how powerful
all the images were. The cinematography on

117
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:10,215
this thing is so fantastic. Oh, yeah. And the
shots were so compelling. I remember thinking

118
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:14,719
as I was watching it, it looks like it's going
to be really good. But I'm not holding my breath

119
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,915
because a lot of the reviews that have been
coming in since the review embargo has lifted

120
00:11:19,955 --> 00:11:26,399
for the film have portrayed it as like a middling
movie. Well, it's currently resting at a like

121
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,762
low 60s Rotten Tomatoes score with about 50
reviews, but that doesn't really bother me

122
00:11:31,942 --> 00:11:37,485
because the first Joker film is sitting in the
60s for its Rotten Tomatoes score and a lot

123
00:11:37,505 --> 00:11:41,608
of these reviews came out of the film's premiere
at the Venice Film Festival where the first

124
00:11:41,648 --> 00:11:46,795
film did fantastic, ended up taking the Golden
Lion. The sequel didn't do as well, but I think

125
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:51,698
that was because it didn't meet the expectations
of a lot of critics in terms of what the film

126
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:57,941
actually was. Like it's being sold as this musical,
but apparently it's barely a musical. So I

127
00:11:57,982 --> 00:12:02,204
saw a lot of critics mentioning that. That doesn't
bother me. I know a lot of people have been

128
00:12:02,244 --> 00:12:07,227
complaining about the musical aspect to begin
with. So, I don't know. I still think it's

129
00:12:07,247 --> 00:12:11,109
going to be a really good film. I'm not sure
if it's going to be as good as the first, but...

130
00:12:11,594 --> 00:12:17,296
That Rot Tomato score does not scare me, especially
after a trailer like this. I feel like this

131
00:12:17,316 --> 00:12:23,819
gives us a lot of Arthur Fleck as the Joker,
more so than we've seen in previous trailers.

132
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,161
Like when he's talking to his friend on the
witness stand, when he's watching Kirby Dent

133
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:33,282
talk about him on the television, when he's
being carried up to his cell and he's like,

134
00:12:33,363 --> 00:12:39,165
Oh, I'm in trouble. It's great to see Joaquin
Phoenix play the role that got him an Oscar

135
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:43,527
the last time he portrayed the role. I think
he's going to do phenomenal. I think Lady Gaga

136
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:47,490
is going to do phenomenal. We get to hear her
sing for the first time in this trailer. That's

137
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:52,994
life. And it's a great rendition. It almost
sounds like Amy Winehouse. It's fantastic.

138
00:12:53,034 --> 00:12:58,718
But the thing that really sold me on this trailer
is actually the different blurbs that we get

139
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:06,083
to see from various reviews that have described
the film in ways like cinematic dynaMic deranged

140
00:13:06,183 --> 00:13:11,578
and exciting, a surreal work of art. It's like...
Anytime these things popped up on screen, I'm

141
00:13:11,638 --> 00:13:16,381
just like, yes, please. Yes, please. Hey, you
think that you'd be checking your expectations

142
00:13:16,681 --> 00:13:23,465
by this point, though? You would think. Um,
but it's the Joker. Like, I just watched the

143
00:13:23,525 --> 00:13:28,888
first film again a couple of weeks ago and man,
that film still holds up the cinematography,

144
00:13:28,948 --> 00:13:35,031
the acting, the direction. It's so, so good.
And I'm really looking forward to this movie.

145
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:41,114
Like I cannot be sold enough. I thought, and
then this trailer comes out and I'm like, I

146
00:13:41,134 --> 00:13:46,879
could only be so sold, you know? The movie's
not gonna be, you know, Deadpool and Wolverine,

147
00:13:47,019 --> 00:13:50,622
but I'm sure it'll be fine. We'll find out in
a few weeks, I guess. I know, it's gonna be

148
00:13:50,722 --> 00:13:54,405
nothing like that. It's gonna be way better,
like a work of art, right? Deadpool and Wolverine

149
00:13:54,465 --> 00:13:59,089
was like a work of art. Thank you very much.
Yeah, for Marvel fans, go read the back of

150
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:03,192
a cereal box. Hey, you better watch yourself
the way you talk to us, because the next thing

151
00:14:03,212 --> 00:14:07,396
you know, this movie's gonna bomb and we're
all gonna laugh at you and then slap the shit

152
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:12,804
out of you. But hey, if everyone's laughing...
I mean, didn't the movie do its trick? No.

153
00:14:12,824 --> 00:14:18,348
Okay. But considering the musical nature of
this film and the fact that Lady Gaga has been

154
00:14:18,368 --> 00:14:23,513
cast as Harley Quinn, and it seems to be a great
casting choice, that brings us to our question

155
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:23,953
of the week.

156
00:14:28,482 --> 00:14:35,525
What musician would you cast as a live action
Marvel or DC character? And what character

157
00:14:35,545 --> 00:14:41,529
would that be? Jared Leto as the Joker. Can't
do that. You can't do Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn.

158
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:47,872
You have to do something original. No fucking
Gavin Rosedale as some demon character or anything

159
00:14:47,892 --> 00:14:52,615
like that. Alright. Record your answer guys

164
00:15:17,966 --> 00:15:21,011
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and get into

165
00:15:21,051 --> 00:15:25,359
our main event, where we find out who would
win in a fight between the Batman villain,

166
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,445
Kite Man, and the Daredevil villain, Stilt Man.

167
00:15:43,562 --> 00:15:47,783
Alright, Kite Man versus Stilt Man. This is
a Batman villain versus a Daredevil villain.

168
00:15:48,443 --> 00:15:53,664
And both of them are largely regarded as jokes,
I think, within their respective comic book

169
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:58,246
universes. They're not very successful. They're
kind of known for being losers, but they kind

170
00:15:58,266 --> 00:16:01,667
of have endearing qualities to them just in
kind of like the ridiculous nature of their

171
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:08,909
powers, right? Kite Man uses fucking kites to
perform acts of villainy. And Stilt Man walks

172
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:13,650
on fucking stilts. Like what the hell is going
on here? This is ridiculous, but I'm also here

173
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:19,294
for it. Yeah, the concepts that these characters
chose to base their villainous theme on is

174
00:16:19,394 --> 00:16:25,197
pretty ridiculous and absurd. But interestingly
enough, these two characters are kind of like

175
00:16:25,277 --> 00:16:32,261
masters of the sky. So with that and the ridiculous
natures, I think this is a fantastic matchup

176
00:16:32,301 --> 00:16:37,203
and one that I've been looking forward to doing
ever since the concept was first introduced.

177
00:16:37,404 --> 00:16:41,610
I'm actually really glad that Kite Man ended
up getting his own show. because otherwise

178
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:45,811
we may never have done this episode because
these characters are just so ridiculous and

179
00:16:45,851 --> 00:16:49,452
obscure. Yeah, we're kind of scratching the
bottom of the barrel here, but I actually think

180
00:16:49,492 --> 00:16:54,333
these characters are renowned for being like
D-listers, you know? Yeah, they're infamous.

181
00:16:54,553 --> 00:16:58,014
Let's go ahead and get into their backstories.
To explain the methodology behind our duels,

182
00:16:58,315 --> 00:17:04,336
let's go to our sentient duel simulator, Alfred
Jarvis 9000. AJ9K, tell our listeners how you

183
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:09,846
go about determining a winner in our duel matchups.
Yes, of course, sir. The way I determine a

184
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:14,687
winner between the contestants is by running
1000 Monte Carlo simulations using the characters

185
00:17:14,727 --> 00:17:20,289
statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic
model used to determine outcomes through random

186
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:26,190
sampling. In this case, I randomise the statistics
along a normal distribution as a way to simulate

187
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:30,811
the many variables that can occur during battle.
The stat parameters are based on the official

188
00:17:30,851 --> 00:17:34,953
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters
statistics are extrapolated.

189
00:17:38,402 --> 00:17:43,525
damage potential, versatility and perception
in order to create a more detailed and accurate

190
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:48,950
simulation. The results of the 1000 simulations
provide a percentage of wins for each character.

191
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:53,973
The contestant with the higher percentage is
declared the victor as they have a higher probability

192
00:17:54,014 --> 00:17:59,838
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,
neither character should win 100% of the matches.

193
00:18:00,338 --> 00:18:04,822
The comic book stories have shown that there's
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman. So

194
00:18:04,842 --> 00:18:08,725
the confidence rate of my method falls in line
with the precedents that have been established

195
00:18:08,765 --> 00:18:14,310
in the source material. My mathematical simulations
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are

196
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:18,754
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes
tabulated for determination of the winner.

197
00:18:20,215 --> 00:18:25,039
Thanks AJ9K! Before we run the simulations though,
we like to break down each character's histories

198
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:30,724
and abilities before improvising a scenario
on how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations

199
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:36,228
would play out beat for beat. And I believe
it's my turn to go first with the DC characters

200
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:42,454
backstory, so let me tell you all about Kite
Man. The Charles Chuck Brown had a fascination

201
00:18:42,474 --> 00:18:48,519
with kites from a young age. His childhood hobby
of flying kites soon evolved into an obsession,

202
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:54,344
and as he grew older, his obsession began to
shape his life in unexpected ways. Rather than

203
00:18:54,384 --> 00:19:00,349
pursue a conventional career, Chuck turned to
crime. Using his love of kites and his knack

204
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:05,835
for engineering, He developed a series of specialized
kite-themed weapons and gadgets, crafting an

205
00:19:05,915 --> 00:19:11,478
identity that would strike fear, or at least
confusion, into the hearts of Gotham citizens

206
00:19:11,838 --> 00:19:17,280
as the criminal known as Kite Man. Bram designed
a large kite that he strapped to his back,

207
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,702
allowing him to glide through the air and escape
from crime scenes swiftly. Armed with a variety

208
00:19:22,742 --> 00:19:28,444
of kites, from tear gas emitting kites to large
kite planes, Chuck launched a crime spree across

209
00:19:28,484 --> 00:19:35,604
Gotham City. by using tear gas released from
one of his kites to disorient security during

210
00:19:35,644 --> 00:19:41,707
a high-profile robbery, during which he stole
a valuable ruby. With this kite-themed technology,

211
00:19:42,028 --> 00:19:47,511
he not only managed to evade the authorities,
but also freed a mobster from prison using

212
00:19:47,551 --> 00:19:53,574
the chaos he created to his advantage. In the
process, he nearly killed Robin and managed

213
00:19:53,654 --> 00:19:59,357
to capture Batman, solidifying his reputation
as a legitimate threat to Gotham's heroes.

214
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:06,074
However, despite his initial success, Kite Man's
overconfidence proved to be his downfall. After

215
00:20:06,114 --> 00:20:10,938
leaving the mobsters to guard Batman, Kite Man
returned to find that Robin had managed to

216
00:20:11,018 --> 00:20:16,382
free his mentor. In a swift turn of events,
Batman and Robin used Kite Man's own weapons

217
00:20:16,442 --> 00:20:22,267
against him, ultimately defeating him and bringing
him to justice. His kite plane, which had been

218
00:20:22,307 --> 00:20:28,191
a key part of his escape plans, was later kept
as a trophy in the Batcave, symbolizing Batman's

219
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:33,234
victory over the kite-obsessed criminal. After
serving time in prison, Chuck wasted little

220
00:20:33,254 --> 00:20:38,418
time resuming his criminal activities. Still
dedicated to his kite-centric theme, he launched

221
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:44,202
a new series of robberies, this time focusing
on payroll heists. With his inventive use of

222
00:20:44,262 --> 00:20:49,734
kites and glider wings, Kite Man was able to
evade capture for some time. though his exploits

223
00:20:49,774 --> 00:20:55,156
were once again thwarted by Gotham's vigilant
protector, Batman. Though his crimes may have

224
00:20:55,236 --> 00:21:00,639
seemed outlandish, Chuck's ability to develop
new Kite-based technologies continued to pose

225
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:06,161
a challenge for Gotham's law enforcement and
heroes alike. Despite repeated defeats, Kite-Man's

226
00:21:06,201 --> 00:21:10,943
determination never wavered. His criminal career
eventually attracted the attention of heroes

227
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:16,706
beyond Gotham, as his antics became more daring.
In one notable encounter, Kite Man set his

228
00:21:16,786 --> 00:21:21,751
sights on a valuable treasure known as the Golden
Eagle. During the heist, he was confronted

229
00:21:21,771 --> 00:21:27,716
by Hawkman, Hawk Girl, and Zatanna, three of
DC's most formidable heroes. Who you could

230
00:21:27,756 --> 00:21:33,821
learn more about in their respective duels against
Wolverine, Gamora, and Scarlet Witch. Kite

231
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:38,986
Man's specialized kites gave him the upper hand
in mid-air combat for a brief period, but Zatanna's

232
00:21:39,046 --> 00:21:45,030
magical abilities ultimately turned the tide.
After a short battle, Kite Man was sent crashing

233
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:53,135
into a tree and was defeated. Kite Man's notoriety
grew further when he relocated to Zandia, a

234
00:21:53,215 --> 00:21:58,198
fictional country notorious for being a haven
for supervillains. The country allowed criminals

235
00:21:58,218 --> 00:22:03,061
like him to operate with relative impunity,
and Kite Man quickly ingratiated himself with

236
00:22:03,141 --> 00:22:07,664
other villains living there. He even joined
Zandia's supervillain sports team, where he

237
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:12,606
used his kite-based technology to contribute
to their success. However, Kite Man's time

238
00:22:12,626 --> 00:22:18,048
in Zandia was cut short when he became involved
in a conflict with a group of invading superheroes.

239
00:22:18,328 --> 00:22:23,271
Despite his abilities, Kite Man was once again
defeated, further cementing his status as a

240
00:22:23,311 --> 00:22:29,253
villain who couldn't quite reach the upper echelons
of criminal success. As the supervillain community

241
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:34,535
evolved, Chuck found himself increasingly on
the margins. During a major event in Gotham

242
00:22:34,595 --> 00:22:39,217
City, Kite Man was approached by a group of
villains looking to form a new criminal syndicate.

243
00:22:39,746 --> 00:22:45,249
When Chuck refused to join their ranks, one
of Gotham's deadliest assassins, Deathstroke,

244
00:22:45,529 --> 00:22:51,814
threw him off of a skyscraper. Although severely
injured, Kite Man survived the fall, managing

245
00:22:51,854 --> 00:22:57,318
to glide to safety using one of his emergency
kites. However, his near-death experience marked

246
00:22:57,378 --> 00:23:02,982
a turning point in his criminal career. Chuck
attempted to reestablish himself in Gotham's

247
00:23:03,062 --> 00:23:08,705
underworld, taking on smaller-scale heists and
selling his custom-made kites to other criminals.

248
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:14,071
His status in the city's criminal hierarchy
continued to decline, and he never regained

249
00:23:14,111 --> 00:23:19,692
the respect or fear he had once commanded. Eventually,
Kite Man was captured alongside several other

250
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:25,574
low-ranking villains, including Sewer King,
the Squid, and Mirage. The group was confronted

251
00:23:25,594 --> 00:23:30,776
by inter-gang leader Bruno Mannheim, who sought
to consolidate his control over Gotham's criminal

252
00:23:30,856 --> 00:23:36,837
operations. When Kite Man and the others refused
to bow to Mannheim's authority, they were brutally

253
00:23:36,937 --> 00:23:43,143
executed. marking the apparent end of Chuck's
criminal career. But in post-Flashpoint continuity,

254
00:23:43,283 --> 00:23:48,124
Charles Brown's origin was reimagined, and his
character was given a more tragic backstory.

255
00:23:48,564 --> 00:23:55,686
Now referred to as Charlie Brown, he was depicted
as a divorced father and an alcoholic, struggling

256
00:23:55,726 --> 00:24:00,708
to find his place in Gotham's underworld. His
love for Kites had initially been a way to

257
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:08,554
bond with his young son, Charlie Jr., who once
exclaimed, Kite Man, hell yeah! in excitement

258
00:24:08,594 --> 00:24:13,778
during their kite flying outings. However, when
Chuck became involved in a war between the

259
00:24:13,838 --> 00:24:19,161
Joker and the Riddler, his life took a dark
turn. Caught in the crossfire of the two villains'

260
00:24:19,201 --> 00:24:25,185
feud, Chuck was used by both sides as a pawn.
The Riddler, wanting to hurt Chuck, poisoned

261
00:24:25,226 --> 00:24:30,849
his son's favorite kites, leading to Charlie
Jr.'s tragic death. Devastated and consumed

262
00:24:30,929 --> 00:24:36,713
by grief, Charlie fully embraced his criminal
alter ego, Kite Man, as a way to seek revenge.

263
00:24:37,346 --> 00:24:42,068
He sided with the Joker in the ongoing war,
determined to bring down the Riddler for what

264
00:24:42,108 --> 00:24:46,871
he had done. Throughout the conflict, Kite Man's
skills were put to the test, and while his

265
00:24:46,951 --> 00:24:52,754
kites proved useful in battle, he was never
able to shake his status as a joke among Gotham's

266
00:24:52,814 --> 00:24:57,657
villains. After the war concluded, Kite Man
continued his criminal activities in Gotham,

267
00:24:57,977 --> 00:25:02,720
though he never regained the level of recognition
he once sought. Despite his tragic past and

268
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:08,082
repeated failures, Charlie remains a determined
criminal, still using his kite-based gadgets,

269
00:25:08,803 --> 00:25:13,265
sometimes in the aid of Batman, in the hopes
of one day gaining the respect he believes

270
00:25:13,285 --> 00:25:18,427
he deserves. Powers-wise, Kite-Man has no innate
superhuman abilities, though he does have an

271
00:25:18,627 --> 00:25:24,790
uncanny understanding of aerodynamics and has
engineered gliders and gadgets seemingly capable

272
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:31,473
of defying gravity and physics. His primary
engineering marvel is a spring-loaded, collapsible

273
00:25:31,553 --> 00:25:37,641
jet-powered glider. He stores on his back that
gives him instantaneous accelerated lift. He's

274
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:43,926
also a master glider, capable of near impossible
acrobatics, acceleration and altitude. He has

275
00:25:44,026 --> 00:25:49,671
also been known to carry small expandable kites
that he can use as heavy projectiles or to

276
00:25:49,731 --> 00:25:56,737
transport explosives or to lead trails of gas
or other material. He also carries binoculars

277
00:25:56,957 --> 00:26:04,746
and when the need arises, a straight up gun
and he will bust a cap if necessary. Binoculars?

278
00:26:05,087 --> 00:26:09,529
I guess he would need those. Yeah, to see far
when he's high up in the sky. You had mentioned

279
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:14,532
at some point during your profile that he got
into a fight with Hawkman and for some reason

280
00:26:14,612 --> 00:26:19,896
gave Hawkman and Hawkgirl a hard time in their
aerial combat. Which doesn't make a fucking

281
00:26:19,916 --> 00:26:24,058
lick of sense to me. That just makes Hawkman
and Hawkgirl look like they suck. Hey, it was

282
00:26:24,298 --> 00:26:29,781
earlier, alright? This isn't like freakin' modern
age comics here. Alright, alright. Well, uh...

283
00:26:30,074 --> 00:26:34,498
I think you will be shocked at how many similarities
there are between Kite Man's backstory and

284
00:26:34,578 --> 00:26:40,405
Stilt Man's. Let's hear it! Alrighty. Little
is known about Wilbur Day's early life, but

285
00:26:40,445 --> 00:26:46,251
as an adult, he earned a PhD in mechanical engineering.
He began working as a brilliant but frustrated

286
00:26:46,311 --> 00:26:52,177
scientist at Caxton Laboratories under Carl
Caxton, who had developed a hydraulic RAM device.

287
00:26:52,706 --> 00:26:57,687
Feeling overlooked and underappreciated, Wilbur
decided to steal Caxton's designs and use them

288
00:26:57,727 --> 00:27:03,529
to engineer a suit of armor equipped with telescopic
hydraulic legs. This suit allowed him to tower

289
00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:08,611
high above the ground, granting him an advantage
in committing crimes and evading capture. With

290
00:27:08,631 --> 00:27:13,772
this invention, Wilbur became the villain known
as Stiltman, using his new abilities to carry

291
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:19,735
out a string of robberies, largely from high-rises
and helicopters. Wilbur sought to steal a molecular

292
00:27:19,775 --> 00:27:25,322
condenser device, another one of Caxton's inventions,
but he was opposed by Daredevil, the blind

293
00:27:25,362 --> 00:27:30,328
vigilante of Hell's Kitchen. During their battle,
Wilbur was accidentally struck by the condenser's

294
00:27:30,388 --> 00:27:36,214
ray, shrinking him to microscopic size and sending
him into a limbo-like dimension. After months

295
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:40,918
in the Microverse, Wilbur eventually returned
to Earth where he resumed his criminal career.

296
00:27:41,358 --> 00:27:46,403
You can learn more about Daredevil in our Nightwing
vs Daredevil episode. Constantly modifying

297
00:27:46,463 --> 00:27:51,907
and improving his armor, Wilbur continued to
battle Daredevil as well as other heroes, including

298
00:27:51,967 --> 00:27:56,831
Spider-Man and Captain America. His telescopic
legs were his greatest asset, allowing him

299
00:27:56,871 --> 00:28:01,655
to extend close to 300 feet, which made him
a difficult target for ground-based opponents.

300
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:07,538
However, despite numerous upgrades to his armor,
including concussive blasters, gas dispensers,

301
00:28:07,658 --> 00:28:13,520
and a machine gun, Stiltman was frequently defeated,
leading to a reputation as an inept and persistent

302
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:18,021
criminal. For more about Spider-Man, check out
our Blue Beetle vs. Spider-Man episode. One

303
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:22,543
of Wilbur's more humiliating moments occurred
when a small-time crook named Turk Barrett

304
00:28:22,623 --> 00:28:28,684
stole his suit and began using it to commit
petty crimes. Angered by this audacity, Wilbur

305
00:28:28,724 --> 00:28:33,914
contacted Daredevil secretly and revealed a
weakness in his armor's auto-gyroscopes. With

306
00:28:33,954 --> 00:28:38,937
this knowledge, Daredevil easily defeated Turk
and returned the suit to its rightful owner.

307
00:28:39,438 --> 00:28:43,561
After this embarrassing incident, Wilbur upgraded
the armor to ensure that no one else could

308
00:28:43,601 --> 00:28:48,325
exploit its weaknesses. Stiltman's criminal
ventures took him across the country. In San

309
00:28:48,365 --> 00:28:53,549
Francisco, he kidnapped his former boss Carl
Caxton and his daughter to force Caxton into

310
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:59,033
recreating the molecular condenser, planning
to use the device for a major heist. This time,

311
00:28:59,073 --> 00:29:04,023
however, Wilbur was defeated by Daredevil and
Black Widow, who foiled his plans and rescued

312
00:29:04,063 --> 00:29:08,344
Caxton. You can learn more about Black Widow
in our Black Canary vs. Black Widow episode.

313
00:29:08,744 --> 00:29:13,845
Despite these failures, Wilbur remained determined
to enhance his suit and reclaim his reputation.

314
00:29:14,265 --> 00:29:19,507
He later upgraded his armor with secondary adamantium,
courtesy of the villain Blastar, which made

315
00:29:19,547 --> 00:29:24,908
the suit virtually indestructible. Feeling invincible,
Stiltman even dared to challenge Thor, the

316
00:29:24,948 --> 00:29:29,489
Norse god of thunder. However, the battle ended
in defeat when Thor stripped him of his armor,

317
00:29:29,854 --> 00:29:35,358
and had it melted down. Wilbur's career continued
to be a mix of minor successes and major defeats.

318
00:29:35,518 --> 00:29:40,482
He was hired to kidnap Assistant District Attorney
Maxine Lavender, but failed when Daredevil

319
00:29:40,522 --> 00:29:45,406
intervened. He also clashed with Black Goliath
after stealing advanced weaponry from the Trapster.

320
00:29:45,907 --> 00:29:50,370
Using a teleportation gun, Stiltman managed
to transport Black Goliath and his companions

321
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:55,715
to an alien planet, but he was ultimately defeated
and forced to flee. In an attempt to regain

322
00:29:55,735 --> 00:30:00,326
his reputation, Stiltman broke into a factory
and created a new armor. During the battle

323
00:30:00,346 --> 00:30:04,449
with Spider-Man that followed, Stiltman had
a change of heart when Spider-Man saved his

324
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:09,832
life from a deadly sonic disruptor. Grateful,
Wilbur returned the favor by sparing Spider-Man's

325
00:30:09,852 --> 00:30:14,515
life and walking away from the fight. Despite
several attempts to leave his life of crime,

326
00:30:14,656 --> 00:30:19,099
Wilbur always found himself returning to villainy.
He joined forces with other supervillains,

327
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:23,922
including the Owl and Gladiator, in an attempt
to take control of the Kingpin's criminal empire.

328
00:30:24,382 --> 00:30:28,805
This plot was foiled by Daredevil and Spider-Man,
and Wilbur's role in the Underworld was further

329
00:30:28,845 --> 00:30:33,764
diminished. After a string of defeats and embarrassments,
including a battle against Iron Man during

330
00:30:33,804 --> 00:30:38,907
the Armour Wars where he was quickly knocked
out, Wilbur decided to retire. He visited the

331
00:30:38,927 --> 00:30:43,050
law offices of Nelson and Murdock, declaring
his intention to leave behind his criminal

332
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:48,293
identity. He left his armor and suitcase on
Matt Murdock's desk and stormed out, feeling

333
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:53,296
paranoid accusations that Murdock was the real
Kingpin. During the Superhuman Registration

334
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:57,931
Act, Wilbur saw a chance for redemption. He
signed up with the government and was outfitted

335
00:30:57,971 --> 00:31:02,135
with a new suit of armor, this time to serve
as law enforcement during the ensuing conflict

336
00:31:02,175 --> 00:31:06,839
between heroes. However, Wilbur's attempt at
becoming a reformed hero ended tragically.

337
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,863
While tracking a child pornographer, Wilbur
crossed paths with the Punisher, who saw him

338
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:16,908
as a criminal beyond redemption. The Punisher
used an anti-tank missile to destroy Wilbur's

339
00:31:16,948 --> 00:31:20,831
legs and then shot him point-blank, killing
him instantly. You can learn more about the

340
00:31:20,851 --> 00:31:25,686
Punisher in our Punisher vs. Red Hood episode.
Wilbur's death sparked a wake at the bar with

341
00:31:25,746 --> 00:31:30,448
no name, attended by many of his fellow villains.
The gathering devolved into chaos when the

342
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:35,369
Punisher, disguised as the bartender, poisoned
the drinks and blew up the bar in an attempt

343
00:31:35,389 --> 00:31:39,990
to kill everyone inside. However, Wilbur's story
didn't end there. He was later resurrected

344
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:44,612
by the Jackal, a geneticist who specialized
in cloning and reviving deceased villains.

345
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:49,873
Stiltman, along with several other reanimated
criminals, was sent out by the Jackal to pursue

346
00:31:49,953 --> 00:31:54,584
Spider-Man. Those actions during this period
were largely unsuccessful, Wilbur's legacy

347
00:31:54,644 --> 00:32:00,088
lived on through successors like Lady Stiltman
and his brief return to criminal life. Did

348
00:32:00,108 --> 00:32:07,693
you just say Lady Stiltman? It's not Stilt Woman?
Yeah, I have no idea why. Her name is Lady

349
00:32:07,733 --> 00:32:13,237
Stiltman. Wow. Powers-wise, Stiltman's abilities
come entirely from his suit of powered armor.

350
00:32:13,637 --> 00:32:18,140
The armor gives him enhanced strength and durability,
allowing him to lift heavy objects nearly a

351
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,915
ton in weight, punch through walls, and withstand
gunfire and attacks from superheroes. His legs

352
00:32:23,955 --> 00:32:28,997
are capable of extending nearly 300 feet, giving
him an unparalleled advantage in height and

353
00:32:29,037 --> 00:32:33,399
allowing him to step over buildings or crush
vehicles beneath them with swift hydraulic

354
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:38,781
force. He can extend or shrink his legs and
his arms almost instantaneously, giving him

355
00:32:38,821 --> 00:32:43,603
incredible punching and kicking power. Stiltman's
battle suit also comes equipped with various

356
00:32:43,663 --> 00:32:48,485
weapons, including a concussive blaster, gas
grenades, and a machine gun attached to his

357
00:32:48,525 --> 00:32:54,608
wrist. He can also grease his stilts to prevent
anyone from climbing up them. Finally, Stiltman

358
00:32:54,628 --> 00:32:58,709
is a skilled mechanical engineer, having built
and improved most of the components of his

359
00:32:58,789 --> 00:33:04,572
armor. And that's Stiltman. So you're telling
me one of his villainous tools is lube? Yeah,

360
00:33:04,992 --> 00:33:11,114
yep. Yeah. Yeah, it's funny. There was a story
that I read in the comics where he basically

361
00:33:11,154 --> 00:33:15,956
tried to franchise out his stilt technology
and sell his stilts to other villains. But

362
00:33:15,996 --> 00:33:21,587
they all basically died in battle or got captured.
And so he just made everyone else a loser.

363
00:33:21,707 --> 00:33:26,811
It was pretty funny. That's just like Kite Man
when he was selling his kites. Yeah. Can Stiltman

364
00:33:26,891 --> 00:33:32,595
extend his arms as far as his legs? That's unknown.
I couldn't quite figure that out. He can extend

365
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:37,118
his arms. I don't know if he could go as far
as 300 feet, though. It's possible. 300 feet.

366
00:33:37,158 --> 00:33:43,283
So that's like 30 stories tall. Yeah, about.
Yeah. OK. Well, this is going to be a really

367
00:33:43,303 --> 00:33:47,345
interesting match. It's time to find out who
rules the skyways.

368

podcast network rises above the rest. Prepare

where we settle the debate and settle the score.

375
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:45,212
Now that we got their histories and abilities
out of the way, we're going to speculate on

376
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:50,677
how one of the 1000 simulated matches will go.
The winner is determined by simulations, not

377
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:55,841
our speculation, but it's fun to imagine how
this fight could play out. AJ9K, what are the

378
00:34:55,881 --> 00:35:00,926
rules of our speculation? Well, I should say
there are no rules other than the characters

379
00:35:00,946 --> 00:35:05,490
have no prior knowledge of the other going into
the fight. All they are aware of starting out

380
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:10,093
is that the other character is a threat that
needs to be eliminated. For the speculation...

381
00:35:10,422 --> 00:35:15,425
The contestants will begin approximately 50
meters apart in a nondescript environment that

382
00:35:15,465 --> 00:35:19,847
will have no bearing on the match itself, as
no environmental statistics are considered

383
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:25,010
in my simulations. The contestants must earn
victory on their own merit. Alright then, let's

384
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:30,594
get into it. Kite Man and Stilt Man meet on
the battlefield. Who goes first? I'm going

385
00:35:30,614 --> 00:35:36,537
to say Kite Man starts off by expanding his
kite glider and just rocketing straight up

386
00:35:36,577 --> 00:35:41,921
into the air. Okay, I can tell you right now,
no matter how fast KiteMan can gain elevation

387
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:46,704
with his kite, it's not gonna be faster than
StiltMan, who can get up to his peak altitude

388
00:35:46,884 --> 00:35:53,049
in seconds. Dude, KiteMan can ascend fast enough
to knock people unconscious from the speed.

389
00:35:53,549 --> 00:35:59,593
And StiltMan can grow fast enough to smash through
ceilings. Okay, whatever. So as KiteMan is

390
00:35:59,633 --> 00:36:04,637
flying up, all of a sudden he sees StiltMan
just rocket past him to get the high ground.

391
00:36:05,057 --> 00:36:10,231
And while... Stiltman is towering above Kite
Man. Stiltman stretches down one of his arms

392
00:36:10,271 --> 00:36:14,712
and just punches a hole in Kite Man's glider,
causing Kite Man to spiral back down to Earth.

393
00:36:15,132 --> 00:36:20,914
Dude, this kite isn't made of like paper. It's
actually pretty durable. So there's no hole

394
00:36:20,954 --> 00:36:26,495
in it. It's just going to, you know, knock Kite
Man into a spiral, but he's going to be spiraling

395
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:33,597
upward. So as he's twisting around Stiltman,
you know, gaining altitude, he's going to wrap.

396
00:36:33,882 --> 00:36:38,723
up Stiltman's legs with this kite string that's
going to trip Stiltman up and cause him to

397
00:36:38,783 --> 00:36:44,464
fall. And from that height, dude's basically
dead, right? No, his armor is durable enough

398
00:36:44,504 --> 00:36:48,906
to protect him from falls from that height.
But like, what is this kite string made out

399
00:36:48,946 --> 00:36:53,907
of? Because I'm pretty sure Stiltman can just
snap that string by taking a step with his

400
00:36:53,967 --> 00:37:00,889
durable metal legs. It's not cotton, I can tell
you that. Okay. It's probably, you know, some

401
00:37:01,089 --> 00:37:07,257
durable metallic thread that he uses to like
weave his kites or something. Okay, so, Stiltman's

402
00:37:07,317 --> 00:37:12,662
legs are wrapped up, but to keep from falling,
Stiltman is gonna fully retract one of his

403
00:37:12,722 --> 00:37:17,726
legs from the ground, causing it to slip out
of the kite string, okay? So he's balancing

404
00:37:17,746 --> 00:37:22,710
with one leg, and with his one leg free, he's
gonna point his foot right at Kite Man, and

405
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:28,635
extend it, just kicking Kite Man right in the
face. Dink, okay. So Kite Man, you know, his

406
00:37:28,875 --> 00:37:34,278
eyes are probably pretty blurry from getting
kicked in the face. So by the time he regains

407
00:37:34,318 --> 00:37:40,181
his sight, it's too late. He's going to crash
straight into Stiltman's one standing leg.

408
00:37:40,521 --> 00:37:46,063
But this is going to work to Kite Man's advantage
because the impact is going to knock Stiltman

409
00:37:46,144 --> 00:37:51,946
over for real this time. OK, well, if Kite Man
just crashed into Stiltman's legs, you know,

410
00:37:52,006 --> 00:37:55,588
Kite Man's going to be creening through the
air and Stiltman, you know, he's toppling over.

411
00:37:55,628 --> 00:38:03,575
So they're both probably just like, fuck. So.
Stiltman is gonna regain his footing by extending

412
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:08,877
his other leg just to catch himself. I'm guessing
Kite Man is gonna find a way to correct his

413
00:38:08,937 --> 00:38:15,580
trajectory. But at this point, Stiltman is gonna
activate his wrist-mounted machine gun and

414
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:21,102
just start blasting Kite Man with a hail of
bullets. Okay, well, Kite Man is gonna dodge

415
00:38:21,142 --> 00:38:26,605
these bullets by flipping and zipping through
the air. And as he's doing that, he's gonna

416
00:38:26,645 --> 00:38:32,940
leave a trail of small kites. that sail up to
Stiltman's body. And by the time Stiltman even

417
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:38,684
notices them, they're close enough so that when
they detonate explosively, because they were

418
00:38:38,764 --> 00:38:43,467
bomb kites, it's going to rock him so hard,
it's going to topple him to the ground once

419
00:38:43,507 --> 00:38:48,011
again. Except Stiltman did see the explosive
kites, and he was able to shoot them out of

420
00:38:48,031 --> 00:38:52,814
the air with his machine gun before they got
too close for him to really hurt him. Joke's

421
00:38:52,874 --> 00:38:59,762
on you then, because those kites were distractions,
and apparently they worked. Because while Stiltman

422
00:38:59,822 --> 00:39:06,265
is busy shooting those kites, Kite Man's gonna
zip past Stiltman's head with a kite string

423
00:39:06,325 --> 00:39:11,787
tied in a noose that's gonna wrap around Stiltman's
neck, and Stiltman's just gonna get yanked

424
00:39:12,287 --> 00:39:17,289
real hard, straight up into the stratosphere,
like way higher than he's used to. And between

425
00:39:17,309 --> 00:39:21,971
the noose and because he's not used to that
low oxygen up there, Stiltman's gonna pass

426
00:39:22,071 --> 00:39:29,046
out. Well, first of all, Stiltman's battle suit
has a respirator. So he can breathe in high

427
00:39:29,086 --> 00:39:33,929
elevations, that's fine. He is probably getting
choked out. But before that can happen, as

428
00:39:33,949 --> 00:39:38,312
he's being carried up into the air, he's gonna
throw a grenade that's gonna explode next to

429
00:39:38,352 --> 00:39:43,395
Kite Man. It's a sleeping gas grenade. It's
gonna put Kite Man to sleep, forcing him to

430
00:39:43,535 --> 00:39:49,698
drop the noose. And now they're both just falling
from the stratosphere down to earth. Nah, Stilt

431
00:39:49,738 --> 00:39:57,967
Man is falling. Kite Man is gently gliding while
asleep. Ha ha ha, all right. Uh, Stiltman is

432
00:39:58,007 --> 00:40:04,913
gonna save himself from the fall by extending
his stilts and using them like shock springs.

433
00:40:04,933 --> 00:40:10,719
Okay? And then he's gonna start running after
Kite Man using his stilts because Kite Man's

434
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:17,105
asleep at the wheel flying away, but Stiltman
catches up to him with these huge giant strides

435
00:40:17,605 --> 00:40:23,578
and then he extends his arms to land a devastating
hammer blow punch. that just knocks Kite Man

436
00:40:23,618 --> 00:40:29,360
out of the air for good with strong hydraulic
force. Well, actually, Kite Man, you know,

437
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,502
he's floated long enough that by the time Stilt
Man reaches him, he's already woken up. And

438
00:40:34,563 --> 00:40:39,745
so he's able to dodge Stilt Man's attack. And
since a hammer blow punch involves, you know,

439
00:40:39,865 --> 00:40:45,347
both hands being interlocked, Kite Man's going
to quickly lasso those fists together with

440
00:40:45,407 --> 00:40:51,429
kite string attached to this antenna like kite
that's just going to rocket into the atmosphere.

441
00:40:51,974 --> 00:40:56,978
and it's going to get struck by lightning, which
is going to send electricity surging through

442
00:40:57,058 --> 00:41:02,142
still a man's metallic suit, just electrocuting
him and frank him to a crisp while also teaching

443
00:41:02,182 --> 00:41:06,626
him in his last moments. The same lesson that
Benjamin Franklin learned all those years ago.

444
00:41:07,026 --> 00:41:10,749
You don't fuck with kites. What is it raining
or something? What the fuck? Like, what kind

445
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:16,594
of environmental bullshit is that? Why is there
lightning all of a sudden? It was an ionized

446
00:41:16,634 --> 00:41:22,711
kite designed to attract lightning. Duh. An
ionized kite. I'm calling bullshit. But either

447
00:41:22,751 --> 00:41:28,696
way, Stiltman can detach any part of his stilts
or arms if they get trapped. So the only thing

448
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:34,681
that Kite Man electrocuted was this pair of
metal arms. And that is when Stiltman is going

449
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:41,566
to whip out his concussive blaster pistol and
just blast off Kite Man's kite entirely and

450
00:41:41,626 --> 00:41:46,170
Kite Man falls to his death. Oh no no, Kite
Man has emergency parachute kites that will

451
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:51,174
deploy automatically if he's falling too fast.
Fine, those get blasted too. What else does

452
00:41:51,214 --> 00:41:57,078
Kite Man have that'll save him? Uh, I mean,
he has those get blasted to everything gets

453
00:41:57,118 --> 00:42:03,703
blasted. Kite Man dies. I don't actually think
he has anything else anyway, but I'm going

454
00:42:03,723 --> 00:42:09,086
to say that, uh, electricity just moves way
too fast, bro. There's no way still man disengages

455
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:14,930
his arms fast enough to escape the lightning,
but it also takes time for lighting to develop.

456
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:21,206
So yeah, still man had plenty of time. Sorry.
I guess we'll leave it there. Either Stiltman

457
00:42:21,286 --> 00:42:28,669
gets electrocuted via a kite and lightning,
or Kite Man essentially just falls to his death

458
00:42:28,789 --> 00:42:33,771
after his kite and all of his emergency parachutes
get blasted away. We'll go ahead and leave

459
00:42:33,811 --> 00:42:38,113
the match there. Let's find out which of these
scenarios happens by running the simulations

460
00:42:38,153 --> 00:42:44,316
for these characters and coming back with a
winner. AJ9K, hit it. Inputting data, running

461
00:42:44,336 --> 00:42:50,218
calculations, processing results, simulations
complete. All right, that was a fun match.

462
00:42:50,799 --> 00:42:55,542
When I came to figuring out the statistics for
each of these characters, I was actually pretty

463
00:42:55,582 --> 00:43:00,105
surprised at how often they came out as equals
in some of these categories. Like I thought

464
00:43:00,165 --> 00:43:05,929
Kite Man was gonna be faster than Stilt Man,
but it turns out Stilt Man can move pretty

465
00:43:06,009 --> 00:43:10,772
quickly when his legs are really long. Yeah,
he also gains altitude really quickly too.

466
00:43:10,913 --> 00:43:15,656
It's interesting that both of these characters,
their whole MO is about the aerial advantage,

467
00:43:15,716 --> 00:43:20,830
right? But they both approach it in very different
ways. Like Kite Man, he's all about projectiles

468
00:43:20,990 --> 00:43:25,652
and like his trick kites and stuff like that.
Whereas Stilt Man is more about like strength

469
00:43:25,712 --> 00:43:30,573
and durability, you know? Yeah, and because
of that, obviously Stilt Man came out on top

470
00:43:31,033 --> 00:43:36,895
in the stats of durability and strength, but
Kite Man came out on top in terms of versatility

471
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:43,036
and range, thanks to all of his trick kites.
And what was really stupid is that Kite Man

472
00:43:43,136 --> 00:43:49,850
got the edge in perception because he has those
binoculars. That's right. You think that Stiltman

473
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:53,611
would have binoculars, too, or something like
that, to enhance his perception. He doesn't

474
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:58,233
need him because he's still, for the most part,
about close quarters combat. Right. Exactly.

475
00:43:58,413 --> 00:44:02,034
Yeah, he's a lot more physical than Kite Man,
for sure. We said that they were pretty much

476
00:44:02,214 --> 00:44:06,815
dead even when it came to intelligence. They're,
you know, pretty much experts in their respective

477
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:12,716
fields. But when it came to damage level, still,
man, it was just slightly ahead of Kite Man,

478
00:44:12,917 --> 00:44:16,882
which I also thought was surprising. For the
most part, these guys are all about you know,

479
00:44:16,942 --> 00:44:22,424
using explosives and various gases. But there's
something to be said when you could literally

480
00:44:22,544 --> 00:44:27,546
stop on a car. Yeah. Or punch through a wall,
you know. But taking all of these stats into

481
00:44:27,586 --> 00:44:32,388
consideration, Joseph, who do you think? You
know, you don't even need to ask before you

482
00:44:32,408 --> 00:44:37,290
even finish your question. It's still man. It's
going to be still man. I will finish. I was

483
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:41,872
going to ask who you thought was going to lose.
You think you think I was going to lose. All

484
00:44:41,912 --> 00:44:47,306
right. I think I'm going to lose and still man's
going to win. And I think our Instagram followers

485
00:44:47,486 --> 00:44:53,249
misunderstood the question too, because 59%
of them are siding with Kite Man. And there's

486
00:44:53,289 --> 00:44:58,591
no way that's right. I mean, the guy does have
his own animated series. Just Stilt Man? Is

487
00:44:58,651 --> 00:45:04,253
he cool enough for that? Nope. Well, a version
of Stilt Man was in the Daredevil Netflix show,

488
00:45:04,353 --> 00:45:09,935
Turk. Oh, that's right. Yeah, I forgot about
that. But he never used the stilts in that

489
00:45:09,955 --> 00:45:14,777
show. So, yeah, probably for the best. But let's
find out the results of this week's match.

490
00:45:15,122 --> 00:45:23,108
AJ 9K, the results, please. Hey, you are, sir.
The winner of the matchup between Kite Man

491
00:45:23,729 --> 00:45:31,035
and Stilt Man is Stilt Man. Before you even
give the answer, it's going to be Stilt Man.

492
00:45:31,055 --> 00:45:38,240
I already know it. I meant loser. So you think
the loser is going to be Stilt Man? Yeah, Stilt

493
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:44,245
Man is the winner of this matchup. He won six
hundred and ninety three of the 1000 matches.

494
00:45:44,734 --> 00:45:55,299
or 63.9% compared to Kite Man's 36.1%. That
sucked, I'm not gonna lie. I was really looking

495
00:45:55,319 --> 00:46:00,082
forward to winning this matchup so I could just
be like, hell yeah. Well, let's all hear your

496
00:46:00,102 --> 00:46:07,906
best hell no. Hell no. I know exactly what that
feels like every time Marvel loses a match.

497
00:46:08,206 --> 00:46:15,574
That's what I say inside. It feels so nice to
be able to say though that KiteMan is the bigger

498
00:46:15,615 --> 00:46:20,997
loser out of these two. That's depressing. I
don't know, maybe it's fitting. Maybe he was

499
00:46:21,038 --> 00:46:27,241
destined for this. This is just the kind of
luck that KiteMan would have. And this would

500
00:46:27,261 --> 00:46:32,324
be the first time that Stiltman has accomplished
anything, really. So that's interesting. But

501
00:46:32,344 --> 00:46:38,866
that does it for this duel, guys. AG9K, help
close this out. Thanks for listening to Dynamic

509
00:47:20,418 --> 00:47:23,920
