00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:06,754
This is a Dynamike Network podcast. Hey everyone,
Marvelous Joe here at the top of the episode.

2
00:00:06,854 --> 00:00:11,857
With the approaching holiday season, we're officially
underway with this year's Holiday Charity Drive

3
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:17,101
and lead up to our charity dual episode in December,
which is going to be Alfred Pennyworth versus

4
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:22,444
Edwin Jarvis. This year, all donations will
be going once again to Pop Culture Classroom,

5
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:28,048
a non-profit organization that delivers high
quality, all-inclusive educational resources

6
00:00:28,068 --> 00:00:33,100
to school districts, teachers, and community
organizations using comics, graphic novels,

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,584
and related pop culture media. Their mission
is to inspire a love of learning, increase

8
00:00:38,645 --> 00:00:44,229
literacy, celebrate diversity, and build community
through the tools of popular culture and the

9
00:00:44,269 --> 00:00:50,154
power of self-expression. To donate, visit our
official store through dynamicduel.com where

10
00:00:50,174 --> 00:00:56,779
you'll find two donation options, one if you're
Team DC and one if you're Team Marvel. Or you

11
00:00:56,819 --> 00:01:04,211
can go directly to dynamicduel.com slash Donate
DC, one word, or dynamicduel.com slash donatemarvel,

12
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:09,292
which are linked in our show notes. We're making
the charity drive a competitive duel this year,

13
00:01:09,712 --> 00:01:14,754
except the only stat that matters is which side
can donate the most. Everyone who donates will

14
00:01:14,794 --> 00:01:19,115
receive a digital poster featuring original
art of Alfred and Jarvis draw New Yorker style

15
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:24,597
by Jonathan. One lucky random donor will win
a framed print of the Alfred vs Jarvis art

16
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:29,681
that we'll announce during that December duel
episode. which fanbase will be the most charitable,

17
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:34,167
we'll keep everyone posted as to which team
is winning as donations come in during these

18
00:01:34,287 --> 00:01:40,637
upcoming episodes. As of right now, Marvel is
ahead with four more donations than DC. So

19
00:01:40,677 --> 00:01:43,181
you gotta catch up DC fans, on with the show.

20
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:08,882
Hi, welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

21
00:02:08,902 --> 00:02:14,126
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based simulations.

22
00:02:14,606 --> 00:02:20,431
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous
Joe. And in this episode, we're doing a duel

23
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:29,005
between DC's Enchantress and Marvel's Enchantress.
That's right. Both Marvel and DC have a sorceress

24
00:02:29,045 --> 00:02:33,928
character named Enchantress. Obviously the better
one is going to be the Marvel version, but

25
00:02:33,948 --> 00:02:37,051
we're going to find out who'd win in a fight
between these two characters by inputting the

26
00:02:37,071 --> 00:02:41,574
stats and running a thousand simulated matches
between them. I bet you Enchantress is going

27
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:48,819
to win. Oh dude Enchantress is totally going
to stomp. Yes she is. Yeah. Now of course this

28
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,990
episode was supposed to be a review of Loki
season two. but because I'm going on a business

29
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:58,833
trip this week, we're recording this episode
early, and since I haven't seen all of Loki

30
00:02:58,853 --> 00:03:04,057
yet, we are doing a duel for right now. Next
week, we'll review Loki Season Two. Yeah, but

31
00:03:04,097 --> 00:03:08,840
this episode is a good tie-in to Loki Season
Two because the Enchantress, like Loki, is

32
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:14,503
an Asgardian. Since we're recording this episode
early, we're gonna skip over the no prize and

33
00:03:14,543 --> 00:03:19,806
the news portions of this episode and jump straight
into the duel. But before we do that, as our

34
00:03:19,846 --> 00:03:24,189
listeners may know, our dual simulator is so
advanced that it's gained sentience and has

35
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,713
named itself the Artificial Lifeform for running
extensive duels, just a rather very intelligent

36
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:35,017
Simulator 9000, or Alfred Jarvis 9000. Here's
a quick message for our listeners, so listen

37
00:03:35,077 --> 00:03:42,087

62
00:05:47,144 --> 00:05:48,565
the question of the week.

63
00:05:53,142 --> 00:05:57,003
That's right, we're going with the same question
of the week that we had from last episode,

64
00:05:57,123 --> 00:06:01,764
which is What other characters from the Sandman
universe do you hope to get their own series

65
00:06:01,884 --> 00:06:06,365
on Netflix? And this is coming off of the first
trailer we received for the Dead Boy Detectives

66
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:11,266
television show on Netflix. That question still
stands for this week, so go ahead and record

67
00:06:11,286 --> 00:06:15,388

that we'll post to Instagram and our email newsletter.
Again, be sure to answer before November 25th.

72
00:06:41,454 --> 00:06:46,083
And now let's move on to the main event of this
episode where we find out who's gonna win in

73
00:06:46,103 --> 00:06:52,557
a matchup between the Sorceress, the Enchantress
against the Sorceress, the Enchantress.

74
00:07:07,822 --> 00:07:14,866
Alright, Enchantress vs Enchantress. As we mentioned
earlier, DC and Marvel both have characters

75
00:07:15,006 --> 00:07:20,010
named Enchantress who are sorcerers within their
respective universes. I don't know much about

76
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:26,354
Marvel's Enchantress. I just know that she's
inferior to DC's. No, because DC's Enchantress

77
00:07:26,374 --> 00:07:30,877
was in a shitty Suicide Squad movie. Oh, you
mean the Academy Award winning Suicide Squad

78
00:07:30,897 --> 00:07:36,521
movie? That's so stupid. Were any of the Thor
movies Academy Award winning films? Did not

79
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:41,780
think so. I don't think so. Exactly, neither
did I. Marvel's Enchantress though has kind

80
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:47,304
of made an appearance on the screen in the Loki
television show because the second iteration

81
00:07:47,344 --> 00:07:53,848
of the character was named Sylvie. And so the
Loki TV show Sylvie is kind of a riff on that

82
00:07:53,868 --> 00:07:58,991
version of the Enchantress. So it's real fitting
that this episode is in tie-in to our Loki

83
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,813
season two review that's coming out next week.
Oh, that's interesting, I didn't know that.

84
00:08:03,294 --> 00:08:07,035
Yeah, but I'm going to be going with the original
version of the character who's an Asgardian

85
00:08:07,075 --> 00:08:14,396
named Amora. I thought her name was Enchantress!
No! Okay. Well, to explain the methodology

86
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:20,358
behind our duels, let's go to our sentient duel
simulator, Alfred Jarvis9000. AJ9K, tell our

87
00:08:20,398 --> 00:08:26,380
listeners how you go about determining a winner
in our duel matchups. Yes, of course, sir.

88
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,141
The way I determine a winner between the contestants
is by running 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations

89
00:08:31,241 --> 00:08:36,111
using the character's statistics. A Monte Carlo
simulation is a probabilistic model used to

90
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:41,274
determine outcomes through random sampling.
In this case, I randomised the statistics along

91
00:08:41,294 --> 00:08:45,777
a normal distribution as a way to simulate the
many variables that can occur during battle.

92
00:08:46,157 --> 00:08:50,919
The stat parameters are based on the official
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters'

93
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:56,122
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat
categories are included such as range, damage

94
00:08:56,162 --> 00:09:01,505
potential, versatility and perception in order
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.

95
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:06,852
The results of the 1000 simulations provide
a percentage of wins for each character. The

96
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:11,355
contestant with the higher percentage is declared
the victor, as they have a higher probability

97
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:17,218
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,
neither character should win 100% of the matches.

98
00:09:17,718 --> 00:09:22,201
The comic book stories have shown that there's
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so

99
00:09:22,241 --> 00:09:26,123
the confidence rate of my method falls in line
with the precedents that have been established

100
00:09:26,143 --> 00:09:31,686
in the source material. My mathematical simulations
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are

101
00:09:31,726 --> 00:09:36,110
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes
tabulated for determination of the winner.

102
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:41,995
Thanks AJ9K! Before we run the simulations though,
we like to break down each character's histories

103
00:09:42,035 --> 00:09:46,799
and abilities before improvising a scenario
on how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations

104
00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:51,823
would play out beat for beat. And I believe
it's my turn to go first with the DC characters

105
00:09:51,843 --> 00:09:59,998
backstory, so let me tell you all about Enchantress.
Jun Moon was a timid whose entire life was

106
00:10:00,058 --> 00:10:05,621
changed, the fateful evening her boyfriend,
Alan Dell, surprised her by bringing her to

107
00:10:05,661 --> 00:10:12,905
a costume party at an old, abandoned, and supposedly
haunted castle, aptly named Terror Castle.

108
00:10:13,445 --> 00:10:19,069
Overwhelmed by the party and the supernatural
forces within the castle, June snuck away to

109
00:10:19,109 --> 00:10:23,491
a secluded area and accidentally slipped through
a secret panel in a wall.

110
00:10:28,382 --> 00:10:34,927
known as Zamor, who explained to June that fate
had brought her there, and that she was destined

111
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:41,472
to be a powerful sorceress that could rid the
castle of its evil. By speaking the word Enchantress,

112
00:10:41,913 --> 00:10:47,017
June transformed into a mystical witch, and
was able to defeat the evil forces haunting

113
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:53,642
the castle. June became a superhero, transforming
her blonde hair black and blue eyes green whenever

114
00:10:53,662 --> 00:11:00,440
she summoned her magical Enchantress alter ego.
to save the life of her boyfriend, Allen, who

115
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:06,185
found himself attracted to Enchantress, not
realizing she was really June. Eventually,

116
00:11:06,485 --> 00:11:12,970
June got a full-time job at the New Athens Experimental
School in Florida, where Linda Danvers, aka

117
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:18,295
Supergirl, also worked. You can learn more about
Supergirl in our Supergirl vs. Captain Marvel

118
00:11:18,335 --> 00:11:24,900
duel episode. It was at New Athens that June
stumbled upon Zamor once again, and the creature

119
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:30,711
explained to June, that soon the moon was going
to align with a star that would allow June

120
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:37,774
to gain omnipotent magical power and the potential
to destroy all evil at the cost of also destroying

121
00:11:38,134 --> 00:11:44,117
all scientific laws that governed the universe.
Deciding it was worth the risk, June attempted

122
00:11:44,157 --> 00:11:50,099
to gain the power, but Supergirl prevented her
from doing so by moving the moon out of alignment.

123
00:11:50,619 --> 00:11:55,481
Whether it was due to Supergirl's misalignment
of the heavenly bodies that affected June,

124
00:11:55,942 --> 00:12:01,805
or June's own frustration at being forced to
fight a never-ending battle against evil, the

125
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:07,528
Enchantress became corrupted and attempted to
take over the world, forming a team known as

126
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:13,631
the Forgotten Villains, though their plots were
continually defeated by Supergirl and Superman.

127
00:12:14,112 --> 00:12:19,034
After the Crisis on Infinite Earths event, June
sought penance for her actions as the Enchantress

128
00:12:19,415 --> 00:12:25,430
and volunteered for Amanda Waller's Task Force
X, aka the Suicide Squad. which you can learn

129
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:30,995
more about in our team duel episode, Suicide
Squad vs. the Defenders. As various missions

130
00:12:31,075 --> 00:12:35,819
undertaken by the squad were completed, June
stayed on with the team while others left,

131
00:12:36,179 --> 00:12:41,663
as Waller had promised to help her control the
corrupted evil Enchantress entity that she

132
00:12:41,683 --> 00:12:47,828
believed now dwelled within her. June was diagnosed
with schizophrenia, and the Enchantress seemingly

133
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:53,233
became more and more powerful and volatile with
each new mission, often forcing her teammates

134
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:58,877
to subdue her while in the field. The field's
team leader, Bronze Tiger, who you can learn

135
00:12:58,897 --> 00:13:04,022
more about in our Bronze Tiger vs White Tiger
episode, took June to see the ancient mystic

136
00:13:04,122 --> 00:13:10,627
Madame Xanadu, who explained to June that her
lack of training had resulted in her aura succumbing

137
00:13:10,667 --> 00:13:16,452
to evil influences. June learned that if she
stopped using magic, her aura would eventually

138
00:13:16,512 --> 00:13:22,257
heal, and Madame Xanadu gave June a necklace
and ring that would help her suppress the evil

139
00:13:22,277 --> 00:13:27,989
within her. With the warning, the Enchantress'
magic would also build up over time and would

140
00:13:28,049 --> 00:13:33,592
likely be unstoppable if she ever emerged again.
While aiding the Suicide Squad on a mission

141
00:13:33,632 --> 00:13:39,496
to the Nightshade Dimension, June learned that
the Enchantress was in fact a separate entity

142
00:13:39,576 --> 00:13:46,381
from another dimension known as Succubus, the
sister of Incubus, who had conquered that dimension.

143
00:13:46,841 --> 00:13:52,165
Incubus ripped Succubus out of June's body,
leaving her powerless, and June left the team

144
00:13:52,225 --> 00:13:58,156
soon after, it eventually ended up in a mental
institution. Succubus herself later escaped

145
00:13:58,196 --> 00:14:04,019
to Earth during the Day of Judgment storyline,
only to seemingly be sacrificed by the warlock

146
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:11,103
Sebastian Faust to reignite the fires of Hell.
In reality, however, Sebastian had merely captured

147
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:17,407
Succubus, who later escaped and assumed the
identity of Anita Solida. Faust was able to

148
00:14:17,487 --> 00:14:24,082
re-bind Succubus to June, however, and when
the Spectre attempted to Enchantress was able

149
00:14:24,102 --> 00:14:29,924
to nearly defeat the Spectre by channeling magic
from all magical beings on Earth, but the power

150
00:14:29,984 --> 00:14:35,066
proved to be too corrupting an influence for
her, and she was forced to give it up. Once

151
00:14:35,106 --> 00:14:41,509
the Spectre was defeated, she joined the magic-based
team known as Shadow Pact. In post-Flashpoint

152
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:46,551
continuity, June's history remained largely
the same, though in one of the Justice League's

153
00:14:46,631 --> 00:14:52,722
early adventures, they failed to stop the global
chaos wrought by the Enchantress entity. when

154
00:14:52,742 --> 00:14:58,526
she was exorcised from June Moon by Madame Xanadu.
This resulted in the formation of the Justice

155
00:14:58,546 --> 00:15:05,252
League Dark Magic Team, who was forced to re-merge
Enchantress with June in order to protect the

156
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:10,056
world from the succubus's power. You can learn
more about Justice League Dark in their team

157
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:15,500
duel episode against the Midnight Suns. June
later joined a new version of the Suicide Squad

158
00:15:15,901 --> 00:15:20,344
and was pivotal in supping Superman with her
magical powers during the Justice League versus

159
00:15:20,505 --> 00:15:27,137
Suicide Squad run. Now powers-wise, Enchantress
is an entity of nearly limitless magical potential,

160
00:15:27,478 --> 00:15:33,002
and regarded as one of the most dangerous mystical
beings in existence. Her power is quelled only

161
00:15:33,042 --> 00:15:38,426
by her host, June Moon, who over the years has
learned to channel the power of the Enchantress

162
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:44,310
to transform and manipulate objects, often bringing
them to life, and also transforming her own

163
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:50,446
appearance or making herself intangible. She
has telekinesis, can fly, can fire devastating

164
00:15:50,486 --> 00:15:56,591
blasts of magical energy, and generate magic-based
constructs. She's also one of the foremost

165
00:15:56,691 --> 00:16:04,278
spellcasters, able to heal, teleport, cast illusions,
and bind herself to other magic users, able

166
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:10,202
to track them and even remotely sap or steal
their powers. Her only weakness is actually

167
00:16:10,322 --> 00:16:16,067
using too much power, as it strengthens the
evil succubus within her, who, when unleashed,

168
00:16:16,488 --> 00:16:23,616
is a nigh-omnipotent reality warper. That's
Enchantress. So in the Suicide Squad movie,

169
00:16:23,776 --> 00:16:28,758
the Enchantress also had a brother. I forgot
what they named him in the film, but was that

170
00:16:28,778 --> 00:16:35,261
guy Incubus? Yeah, that was Incubus. Oh, interesting.
I'm surprised he didn't jam out with like whatever

171
00:16:35,321 --> 00:16:46,650
tomorrow brings. I'll be there. Holy shit, that
was awful. Never do that again. No one remembers

172
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:51,451
that band, dude. No one remembers the band.
Incubus is timeless. I just have to say that,

173
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:56,292
so. But let me go ahead and tell you about the
backstory of the superior enchantress in the

174
00:16:56,312 --> 00:17:02,134
Marvel universe. Millennia ago, Amora was born
in the realm of Asgard, one of the nine realms

175
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:07,235
of Norse mythology, and as the goddess of youth
and fertility, grew to be renowned among the

176
00:17:07,255 --> 00:17:13,417
gods for her astonishing beauty. In her adolescence,
she ran away to the land of the Norns, an apprentice

177
00:17:13,477 --> 00:17:19,147
under one of the most powerful sorceresses in
all of the realms. Training in magic into adulthood,

178
00:17:19,667 --> 00:17:24,669
Amora proved to be an adept sorceress herself,
using enchantments primarily to enhance her

179
00:17:24,789 --> 00:17:31,272
natural allure to influence others and developing
a reputation as a seductress. Of all the Asgardian

180
00:17:31,312 --> 00:17:36,594
men she was able to manipulate, however, Thor
Odinson, the God of Thunder, was beyond her

181
00:17:36,634 --> 00:17:41,756
temptations. Driven to infatuation with Thor
and obsessed with the challenge of conquering

182
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:46,991
his heart, Amora was relentless in her pursuit
of him. occasionally teaming up with Thor's

183
00:17:47,011 --> 00:17:51,795
brother Loki to try and break down the God of
Thunder spirit. You can learn more about Thor

184
00:17:51,975 --> 00:17:57,579
and Loki in their respective dual episodes against
Wonder Woman and Ares respectively. Beyond

185
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,523
scheming for Thor's affection, Amora deceived
other fellow Asgardians such as the beautiful

186
00:18:02,563 --> 00:18:07,968
Valkyrie using her magic to trap her in a mystic
crystal, a story you can learn more about in

187
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:13,303
our Power Girl vs Valkyrie dual episode. Chief
among Amora's many suitors was the Asgardian

188
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:18,626
named Scourge the Executioner, who was madly
in love with her and bowed to her every whim

189
00:18:18,926 --> 00:18:23,909
despite his affections being unrequited. When
Thor was banished to Earth by his father and

190
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:29,332
fell in love with the mortal woman Jane Foster,
a jealous Amora went to Earth and tried to

191
00:18:29,392 --> 00:18:35,255
seduce him. After getting spurned once again,
Amora ordered Scourge to eliminate Jane Foster,

192
00:18:35,655 --> 00:18:41,598
but Thor stopped them and hurled the pair back
to Asgard. Amora and Scourge went on to join

193
00:18:41,638 --> 00:18:46,919
Baron Zemo's Masters of Evil supervillain team
in order to beset the newly formed Avengers,

194
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,561
of which Thor was a founding member. As a recurring
villain for the Avengers, Amora eventually

195
00:18:52,621 --> 00:18:57,362
expanded her list of enemies to include some
of Earth's other mightiest heroes, such as

196
00:18:57,422 --> 00:19:01,904
Hercules, whom she also became smitten with,
and the Scarlet Witch, whom she considered

197
00:19:01,944 --> 00:19:06,845
her rival. Amora was one of the many villains
and heroes abducted by the all-powerful entity

198
00:19:06,885 --> 00:19:11,751
called the Beyonder. to take part in his grand
morality experiment to see who would win in

199
00:19:11,771 --> 00:19:17,253
a battle between good and evil, known as the
Secret Wars. On his patchwork planet called

200
00:19:17,353 --> 00:19:23,396
Battleworld, Amora found herself trapped alongside
Thor, and the two finally shared an intimate

201
00:19:23,436 --> 00:19:28,558
encounter. Thor tried to convince Amora to leave
the villains and join the side of good, but

202
00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:34,661
Amora shamefully declined, fearful of the consequences,
but flirting with the idea of being a hero.

203
00:19:34,961 --> 00:19:39,706
With the Secret Wars over, Amora and Scourge
fought alongside their fellow Asgardians to

204
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:44,948
defend their home against the fire demon Surtur,
preventing him from causing Ragnarok or the

205
00:19:44,988 --> 00:19:50,249
Twilight of the Norse gods. The pair also defended
the realm from the Asgardian goddess of death,

206
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:56,531
Hela, though Scourge died in that battle. Amora
later discovered her sister Lorelei had put

207
00:19:56,591 --> 00:20:02,093
a love spell on Thor and she freed the hero
from her sister's bewitchment. Seemingly over

208
00:20:02,133 --> 00:20:07,155
her infatuation with Thor, Amora grew close
to Heimdall. who was the sentry of Asgard's

209
00:20:07,235 --> 00:20:13,501
rainbow bridge known as the Bifrost. Inspired
by his nobility, she became a more unselfish

210
00:20:13,521 --> 00:20:18,846
figure and even fought against her former ally
Loki, protecting Odin's throne. This wasn't

211
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:23,811
meant to last however, and Amora returned to
her scheming ways after realizing Heimdall

212
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:28,976
would always be more devoted to Asgard than
to her, and she parted from him. After menacing

213
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:33,659
Doctor Strange, the Sorcerer Supreme, She moved
to Hollywood and became a movie star for a

214
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:38,503
while, winning the hearts of men through her
films. Amora tried to seduce fellow superhero

215
00:20:38,583 --> 00:20:43,066
actor Wonder Man, whom you can learn more about
in his duel against Captain Adam, but she was

216
00:20:43,186 --> 00:20:48,189
unsuccessful. Eventually, Amora returned home
and fell in battle with the rest of the Asgardians

217
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:53,613
when Loki successfully fulfilled the Ragnarok
prophecies and caused the destruction of the

218
00:20:53,673 --> 00:20:59,237
Nine Realms. Amora was later restored to life
along with the rest of her kind when Thor returned

219
00:20:59,297 --> 00:21:05,411
to Earth. Since Scourge was still dead, having
fallen prior to Ragnarok, Amora magically attacked

220
00:21:05,451 --> 00:21:11,013
the World Tree Yggdrasil in an effort to resurrect
her old ally, having come to the realization

221
00:21:11,153 --> 00:21:15,694
how much he meant to her. Thor and Loki stopped
her, however, convincing her that bringing

222
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:20,776
Scourge back from Valhalla would only dishonor
his death. Amora wasn't the only one meddling

223
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:25,457
with the World Tree, however, as Hela sent most
of the Nine Realms to Hell after gaining the

224
00:21:25,497 --> 00:21:30,806
magical Twilight Sword. Amora teamed up with
Thor to battle the Goddess of Death, helping

225
00:21:30,846 --> 00:21:35,588
him reunite with his hammer Mjolnir in order
to win back the Twilight Sword, which Thor

226
00:21:35,668 --> 00:21:41,489
then entrusted to Heimdall. Later, Amora allied
herself with the villainous dark elf Malekith,

227
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:47,031
joining him in his war to take over the Nine
Realms. She journeyed to Alfheim using her

228
00:21:47,071 --> 00:21:52,312
magic to manipulate Queen Elsa of the Light
Elves into marrying Malekith, and then she

229
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:59,754
invaded the dwarven realm of Nidavellir alongside
the Eventually, the war came to Midgard, aka

230
00:21:59,874 --> 00:22:05,316
Earth's realm, and Amora took the continent
of South America as her prize. After receiving

231
00:22:05,376 --> 00:22:10,597
a premonition of Captain Marvel and Doctor Strange
coming to defeat her, she used a spell to swap

232
00:22:10,657 --> 00:22:14,839
the two heroes' bodies, though they were still
able to defeat her, and Malekith's war was

233
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:19,940
put to an end. Amora was then imprisoned beneath
Asgard in the Root Dungeons before escaping

234
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:25,646
back to Midgard. There, Amora clashed once again
with Captain Marvel. who tried to get her help

235
00:22:25,686 --> 00:22:30,870
in defeating one of Amora's future sons. She
then met with her estranged twin sons that

236
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:36,454
she had with an Asgardian palisade that she
seduced years ago, rescuing the boys, Eirik

237
00:22:36,594 --> 00:22:42,378
and Alvi from an evil wizard named Pulsari,
who had kidnapped them as infants. And that's

238
00:22:42,398 --> 00:22:48,302
her backstory. Powers-wise, the Enchantress
has the physiology of an Asgardian god, meaning

239
00:22:48,322 --> 00:22:54,210
she is strong enough to lift around 25 tons,
has enhanced durability, speed, longevity and

240
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:59,733
healing, as well as enhanced senses. She is
among Asgard's strongest sorcerers, just below

241
00:22:59,773 --> 00:23:05,277
the level of Loki, the god of mischief. Enchantress
can cast all matter of magic spells for a variety

242
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:12,881
of effects, including, but not limited to, shapeshifting,
illusion casting, teleportation, matter transmutation,

243
00:23:13,161 --> 00:23:19,505
hypnosis, telepathy, telekinesis, and manipulation
of magical energies such as magical blasts

244
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:24,909
and shields. Though her specialty is in the
art of magical seduction, able to enthrall

245
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:31,214
others to do her bidding with a kiss, mere words,
or even a glance. She is quite intelligent,

246
00:23:31,374 --> 00:23:38,620
often thinking up devious and manipulative schemes.
And? That's it. Okay, yeah, that's nothing!

247
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:47,487
You got nothing! You're gonna lose! Good day,
sir! You stole fizzy lifting drinks! I didn't

248
00:23:47,507 --> 00:23:53,880
realize Enchantress was so, like, kinky. Like,
like, is this is this speculation going to

249
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,723
turn into some kind of like erotic fanfiction?
No, we can't let that happen. Like you tried

250
00:23:58,763 --> 00:24:04,807
to do with Catwoman and Hellcat and Poison Ivy
and White Queen. All right. I'm not going to

251
00:24:04,827 --> 00:24:07,729
let that happen. We'll see. We'll see where
it goes.

252
00:24:13,794 --> 00:24:18,676
Hey guys, Johnny DC here to remind all of you

258
00:24:48,581 --> 00:24:54,444
new Batman Batmobile black man's tie. It's a
dark silk blend with pops of orange and light

259
00:24:54,464 --> 00:25:00,888
blue Batmobile glyphs and Batman logos. It's
a slick design. I have a few other Batman ties

260
00:25:00,908 --> 00:25:05,510
but this one is definitely my favorite and I
can't wait to wear it to the next business

261
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:11,233
conference I attend where I fully intend to
use it as a conversation starter. Go to cufflinks.com

Thanks, guys. But now that we've got their

264
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:29,103
histories and abilities out of the way, let's
speculate on how one of the 1000 simulated

265
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:34,746
matches will go. The winner is determined by
simulations, not the speculation. But it's

266
00:25:34,786 --> 00:25:39,609
fun to imagine how this fight could play out.
Alfred Jarvis, 9000. What are the rules of

267
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:44,680
our speculation? Well I should say there are
no rules, other than the characters have no

268
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,303
prior knowledge of the other going into the
fight. All they are aware of starting out is

269
00:25:49,343 --> 00:25:53,947
that the other character is a threat that needs
to be eliminated. For the speculation, the

270
00:25:53,987 --> 00:25:59,030
contestants will begin approximately 50 meters
apart, in a nondescript environment that will

271
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:04,374
have no bearing on the match itself, as no environmental
statistics are considered in my simulations.

272
00:26:04,674 --> 00:26:10,054
The contestants must earn victory on their own
merit. Alright then, let's get into it! Enchantress

273
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:19,758
and Enchantress meet on the battlefield. Who
goes first? Enchantress. I think to just avoid

274
00:26:19,798 --> 00:26:25,480
confusion, I'm going to refer to Marvel's Enchantress
as Amora for the purposes of the speculation,

275
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:33,404
so we don't get confused. OK, I still think
my Enchantress will go first because she's

276
00:26:33,424 --> 00:26:39,254
just a little bit more crazy. And I think she's
going to start by hurling. a volley of green

277
00:26:39,314 --> 00:26:47,439
fireballs that crash into Amora and set her
on fire. Boom! Magic Shield! Amora absorbs

278
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:53,323
the fireballs with her magic shield and then
she's gonna reshape that energy into magic

279
00:26:53,423 --> 00:27:00,667
tendrils that shoot out and wrap around Enchantress's
arms and legs, just lifting her into midair

280
00:27:01,027 --> 00:27:07,710
and binding her there. And then Amora's gonna
use a time spell. to age Enchantress centuries,

281
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:14,092
like just turning her into this dusty old skeleton.
Okay, that's fine. This dusty skeleton, her

282
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:19,354
eyes are gonna glow green and she's gonna just
like start cackling like an evil witch and

283
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:24,855
grow to be like four stories tall so that she
breaks free from her restraints. And then she's

284
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:31,917
gonna raise her arms up and summon this magical
dust storm with particulate that's gonna slice

285
00:27:31,977 --> 00:27:38,026
into Amora. and prevent her from being able
to see anything as well. Okay, all right, so

286
00:27:38,086 --> 00:27:44,291
to block this magic dust storm, Amora is going
to conjure up this magical mirror in front

287
00:27:44,311 --> 00:27:49,936
of her that's gonna reflect the particulate
that's being directed at her back at Enchantress

288
00:27:50,256 --> 00:27:56,321
tenfold, which is gonna knock Enchantress to
the ground and quells the storm. Then Amora

289
00:27:56,381 --> 00:28:01,365
is gonna step into the mirror that she conjured
and the mirror vanishes with her inside of

290
00:28:01,385 --> 00:28:08,681
it. Okay, uh, well the magic that bombarded
the giant skeleton Enchantress only empowered

291
00:28:08,722 --> 00:28:13,284
her because it was her own magic. So that's
gonna blow away the oldness and reveal the

292
00:28:13,324 --> 00:28:19,768
young normal-sized Enchantress who, you know,
she doesn't see Amora anywhere. So yeah, apparently

293
00:28:19,848 --> 00:28:24,851
Amora has left the battlefield, so I guess Enchantress
wins. That's what she wants you to think. Suddenly

294
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:31,186
Enchantress, she turns around and sees a reflection
of herself. in this other magical mirror that

295
00:28:31,226 --> 00:28:38,029
pops up next to her, and Enchantress just becomes
transfixed with her own reflection, like Narcissus

296
00:28:38,129 --> 00:28:45,232
staring at the pool. Okay, I see what you're
doing here. Okay, Enchantress, she walks up

297
00:28:45,272 --> 00:28:53,436
to the mirror, approaching her reflection apprehensively,
almost shyly at first, but then she and the

298
00:28:53,476 --> 00:29:00,258
reflection starts to kiss gently, but soon...
Like before it even gets to that level of weirdness,

299
00:29:00,859 --> 00:29:07,800
Enchantress, you know, paralyzed, we'll say,
by her own reflection. She gets blasted in

300
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:12,182
the face with a magic beam that shoots through
the mirror, shattering the mirror and revealing

301
00:29:12,222 --> 00:29:18,683
Amora once again on the battlefield. OK. Enchantress,
you know, she's probably knocked to the ground.

302
00:29:19,484 --> 00:29:25,105
In fact, actually, she falls into the ground
by turning herself intangible. And before Amora

303
00:29:25,405 --> 00:29:32,137
even has time to wonder where Enchantress went,
this horde of like Netherworld spawn hands

304
00:29:32,417 --> 00:29:36,760
just burst from the ground beneath her and pull
her down to the ground where they just tear

305
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:43,605
her apart. Okay, uh, I'm gonna say that as the
spawn pull Amora down into the ground, she's

306
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:49,089
gonna expel this like bewitching spell that
is gonna put all of these Netherworld spawn

307
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:55,153
in her thrall. So as she gets back to her feet,
you know, this entire army rises up from the

308
00:29:55,193 --> 00:30:00,958
ground. just ready to kick some Enchantress
ass. Okay, but one of the spawn next to Amora

309
00:30:01,338 --> 00:30:06,803
isn't really a spawn, it's actually Enchantress
in disguise, who is gonna generate this green

310
00:30:06,883 --> 00:30:12,208
flaming dagger when Amora has her back turned
to her and Enchantress just stabs her from

311
00:30:12,248 --> 00:30:18,493
behind. All right, well Amora is no stranger
to back shots, and she detects this attack

312
00:30:18,613 --> 00:30:24,790
coming because her mystic senses see that one
of the spawn isn't under her control. So she's

313
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:31,655
going to expel her astral form from her body
just in time, thereby evading Enchantress's

314
00:30:31,895 --> 00:30:38,520
magic blade. And in her astral form, she's going
to fly into Enchantress's body and cause the

315
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:45,185
Enchantress to just explode from within, leaving
behind just June Moon on the battlefield. And

316
00:30:45,205 --> 00:30:50,629
then that's when Amora's spirit flies back into
her body, magically healing it in the process.

317
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:57,712
Okay, no way that works. If anything, I'm going
to say that with that act, Amora exercises

318
00:30:57,752 --> 00:31:02,874
the succubus from June. But June is the only
thing stopping the succubus from essentially

319
00:31:02,914 --> 00:31:09,716
taking over reality. So that's what the succubus
does. She reforms her body from this dark cloud,

320
00:31:10,376 --> 00:31:16,527
and she's going to open this glowing green fissure.
beneath Amora from which this magical green

321
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:22,670
lava just explodes upward in like this super
volcano level blast that's just gonna incinerate

322
00:31:22,811 --> 00:31:32,396
Amora completely. Match over. Oh well I guess
Amora's dead. Yep she's dead. Except Enchantress

323
00:31:32,436 --> 00:31:38,859
sees her charred body. It's just an illusion.
And when Enchantress approaches the real Amora

324
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:46,523
just grabs her arm from out of nowhere and kissy
kiss smoochy smooch on her lips. Basically

325
00:31:46,603 --> 00:31:53,026
confining Enchantress to a lifetime of servitude
to the Asgardian goddess. Okay, I mean, Enchantress

326
00:31:53,066 --> 00:32:00,009
is shocked by this at first. But like as Amora's
kiss lingers, Enchantress feels complete in

327
00:32:00,089 --> 00:32:06,652
a way that she never has before. And you know,
after- So you admit that Amora wins then. Damn

328
00:32:06,712 --> 00:32:15,243
it. No. All right. We'll go ahead and leave
the match there. We'll say that either Enchantress

329
00:32:15,283 --> 00:32:22,425
blows up Amora in the Super Volcano Magic Blast,
or Amora seduces Enchantress and turns her

330
00:32:22,485 --> 00:32:27,126
into her eternal slave. We'll see which of these
scenarios happens by inputting the stats of

331
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:33,768
these characters and running 1000 simulations,
and then coming back with a winner. AJ9K, hit

332
00:32:33,808 --> 00:32:41,450
it! Inputting data, running calculations, processing
results, simulations complete. Okay, this was

333
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:50,394
a struggle for me stats-wise because DC's Enchantress
is definitely not the physical specimen that

334
00:32:50,454 --> 00:32:55,896
Marvel's Enchantress is, being that Marvel's
Enchantress is Asgardian. Right, yeah, you

335
00:32:55,916 --> 00:33:00,878
know, just due to her natural physiology, Marvel's
Enchantress has increased strength, increased

336
00:33:00,918 --> 00:33:06,501
durability that the Enchantress really doesn't
have. That being said, Enchantress, we said,

337
00:33:06,561 --> 00:33:11,793
was a better fighter. than Marvel's Enchantress
because she's actually gone to blows with Superman

338
00:33:11,953 --> 00:33:17,738
using her magical fists. Whereas Marvel's Enchantress,
I don't think I've seen ever throw a punch.

339
00:33:18,018 --> 00:33:22,302
She usually prefers to have other people do
the fighting for her. That's kind of the nature

340
00:33:22,362 --> 00:33:28,147
of her whole manipulation based magic. Right.
When it came down to things like movement speed,

341
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:33,291
evasiveness, perception, and even versatility,
you said that they were pretty much equal.

342
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:37,983
Yeah. You know, since they're both powerful
sorceresses. they can essentially almost do

343
00:33:38,123 --> 00:33:42,687
anything due to the nature of their magic powers.
So taking all of the stats into consideration,

344
00:33:43,208 --> 00:33:48,112
Joseph, who do you think came out on top in
this match? I'm gonna say Marvel's Enchantress,

345
00:33:48,292 --> 00:33:54,638
just due to her Asgardian physiology. We didn't
run any polls on Instagram, but I think that

346
00:33:54,678 --> 00:34:00,743
if we did run a poll, our Instagram followers
would have clearly shown a preference for Enchantress.

347
00:34:00,823 --> 00:34:05,778
Oh, for sure. Yeah, definitely Enchantress.
Well, I have the results right here. Let's

348
00:34:05,798 --> 00:34:12,660
find out who won. AJ9K, the results please.
Here you are, sir. The winner of the matchup

349
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:23,963
between Enchantress and Enchantress is Enchantress.
She totally stopped Enchantress winning 64.9%

350
00:34:25,444 --> 00:34:33,307
of the 1000 matches. Enchantress, meanwhile,
only won 35.1%. I gotta say, I'm not too surprised

351
00:34:33,327 --> 00:34:38,833
that Enchantress won. Um, I think I saw that
coming from the get-go, which, you know, depending

352
00:34:39,053 --> 00:34:44,078
on your perspective, you're either thrilled
about or you think is a bummer. In the end,

353
00:34:44,558 --> 00:34:49,984
Enchantress just had too much going for her
over Enchantress. I'm glad you agree! Actually,

354
00:34:50,024 --> 00:34:55,109
no, I don't. I hate it, because it was Marvel's
Enchantress that won. Ha ha ha! I figured.

355
00:34:58,222 --> 00:35:02,986
Uh, yeah, it was, I mean, it was the Asgardian
physiology that put her over the edge statistically,

356
00:35:03,046 --> 00:35:08,491
right? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. And while you
can say things like, you know, strength stat

357
00:35:08,511 --> 00:35:13,835
doesn't matter to DC's Enchantress who can essentially
lift things through telekinesis, I mean, so

358
00:35:13,855 --> 00:35:17,999
can Marvel's Enchantress, right? So when they
cancel each other out like that, you're just

359
00:35:18,099 --> 00:35:23,584
left with things like physical stats to go off
of. And at the end of the day, Marvel's Enchantress

360
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:28,578
just outclasses her in that regard. I think
what really hurt DC's Enchantress was actually

361
00:35:28,658 --> 00:35:35,520
June Moon, because when Enchantress is not tied
to her host, she's insanely powerful. She could

362
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:40,922
defeat the entire Justice League level power,
like Spectre level power. And I think in that

363
00:35:40,962 --> 00:35:46,863
mode, she's definitely powerful enough to take
on Marvel's Enchantress. It's just that rarely

364
00:35:46,903 --> 00:35:52,565
happens in the comics, especially as June gains
more and more control over the Succubus entity.

365
00:35:52,745 --> 00:35:57,331
So you're lucky I counted for June in the stats.
You son of a bitch. Otherwise, Enchantress

366
00:35:57,351 --> 00:36:05,577
would have won. Enchantress never would have
won. I agree. Yeah, I agree. Wait, what? All

381
00:37:18,258 --> 00:37:22,241
two episodes so far, but I'm going to finish
out the rest. I've been trying to avoid all

382
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:26,444
spoilers at all costs across the internet. And
so I need to watch it like immediately before

383
00:37:26,524 --> 00:37:31,068
something truly tragic gets spoiled for me.
Yes, I've been seeing hints of stuff, but I'm

384
00:37:31,088 --> 00:37:36,392
just like, no, get behind me, Satan. And just
like looking away. But that does it for this

385
00:37:36,432 --> 00:37:40,242
episode, guys. We want to give a big thanks
to our executive producers. Ken Johnson, John
