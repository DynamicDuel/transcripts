00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,780
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi, welcome to
the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,860
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:37,680
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Johnny DC and I'm his twin

4
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,960
brother Marvelous Joe. And in this episode we are
doing a team duel against two of the most baddest

5
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:51,180
teams in DC and Marvel, repeating the authority
against the Cabal. Yeah, for those who may not know

6
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,740
who the Cabal are, it's basically Marvel's
villain version of the Illuminati, the

7
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:03,000
Illuminati being a clandestine group of
superheroes that tackle threats covertly. The

8
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,100
Cabal is comprised of some of Marvel's most
nefarious villains and you are so fucked for this

9
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,860
episode. The authority is going down so damn hard
that there's no way they stand a chance. I'm sorry

10
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:19,820
to tell you this now. No way, the Cabal is exactly
the type of team that the authority would just

11
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:25,240
annihilate. Just freaking destroy them. You
don't know anything about the authority. They're

12
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,240
not originally from DC Comics, they're from
Wildstorm Comics, so I would not expect you to know

13
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,000
how powerful they are. But you're gonna learn
today. We're gonna tell you all about the teams,

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,100
run statistics to find out who would actually win
between them later on in this match before that.

15
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,120
We're gonna break down the comic book and movie
news from this past week, which is a lie again

16
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:50,120
because there wasn't any. Studios are really slow
on the news lately. It's like they're so gun-shy

17
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,720
right now. You don't get why. It's like give us more
stuff to talk about. Don't you want us talking

18
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:00,380
about Marvel in DC? Yeah, don't they know we have a
podcast to run here? What the hell? Selfish

19
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:04,640
bastards. But as always, we list our segment times

41
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:09,520
way quick to the no prize. A no prize is an award that
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version, the

42
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,700
dynamic duel no prize is a digital award we post on
Instagram for the person that we feel gave the best

43
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:20,760
answer to our question of the week. Last week we
asked you guys which company would you most want to

44
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:26,980
acquire Warner Brothers and DC Studios and why and
this is coming off of the news that Warner Brothers

45
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:33,300
is for sale with a number of other studios placing
bids for the acquisition. We got three honorable

46
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:38,900
mentions which we'll go over before revealing
this week's no prize winner. Our first honorable

47
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:45,040
mention goes to Alex Albro who said, Hey guys I
think it ought to be Paramount. They've already

48
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,060
shown interest in acquiring DC. They don't have
any super major theme parks that they're going to

49
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:56,640
want to just market to. They produce great movies
you know early MCU films Watchmen, Top Gun

50
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:01,060
Maverick, they've done Footloose, Friday the
13th, they've done a lot of animation stuff. They

51
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,960
can handle anything that DC is going to throw at
them. They also seem to be interested in keeping

52
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,200
gun which is good for continuity and their app
doesn't charge crazy fees so more people will be

53
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,520
inclined to sub and watch the show. I would not mind
it if Paramount acquired Warner Brothers and I had

54
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,780
actually forgotten that they produced some of the
early MCU films like Iron Man. Yeah that's true

55
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:27,120
Marvel's initial deal was with Paramount for
distribution plus Paramount also owns other IP

56
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,180
like the Ninja Turtles and all of Nickelodeon
which I think DC would be well folded into. Great

57
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:39,940
answer Alex our next honorable mention goes to DC
Joe who said. Definitely don't want Paramount to

58
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,900
acquire them for political and sensitive
reasons. I'm not going to get into it you guys can

59
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,780
look it up. It's very well documented. As for who I
do want them to be acquired by universal

60
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:57,760
definitely universal for many synergy reasons.
The theme parks the other IPs that they hold their

61
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:03,940
distribution and they support physical media.
Yeah I had to look up Paramount politics in order to

62
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:10,520
be clear on what Jose Marcell is referring to in
regards to the politics of the studio and it looks

63
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,720
like decisions like ending the late show with
Stephen Colbert are all based around owners David

64
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:21,220
and Larry Ellison trying to court favor with the
administration by steering their content away

65
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,560
from what they perceive as a liberal bias.
Therefore universal would also not be a bad

66
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,700
option. I like the universal answer mainly for the
theme park angle Disney gets a lot of revenue

67
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,920
through their theme parks and the Marvel rides
have become some of their most popular rides. I

68
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,700
would love DC to be able to compete at that same
level because I actually think universal studios

69
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:50,660
is superior to the Disney parks. Having never been
to either of them I will have to take you out your

70
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:57,580
word on that. Our final honorable mention goes to
Scott Camacho who said. I think it's no question

71
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:07,120
it's wherever universal studios is. Just as you
have Disney, Marvel, and Fox universal DC and

72
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:13,100
Warner Brothers need to be together on that. I mean
just imagine even the universal studios theme

73
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:21,920
parks if you had DC attractions there it's in the
writing let it happen. Right like I said theme

74
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:28,800
parks huge attractions I want to visit the DC
universe IRL and I think the theme parks is the best

75
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:34,920
way to do that. You really hunk up on the theme park
aspect of this potential deal. Well because I know

76
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,840
universal could deliver on that end as well as the
movie end there's really nothing that Paramount

77
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,140
can do that universal can't. Plus universal has
their hands on some pretty solid IP as well such as

78
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:50,280
the Jurassic franchise. Right and movie monsters
although they're really not doing anything with

79
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:57,860
that right now. They need DC as a strong IP. So great
answer Scotty. The winner of this week's no prize

80
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:05,240
however is by DearBangora who said. Hi Denimado. I
think the best company to purchase Warner

81
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:12,520
Brothers and DC studios would be Amazon. I think
with their deep pockets and their capacity to

82
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:19,780
bring to life the boys as well as Vinceable with a
great audience and great awards for both those

83
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:26,640
shows I think they could do something truly
amazing with DC studios and DC comics in general.

84
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,320
I'd be so excited to see what the future would hold.
So this was an interesting answer because Amazon

85
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:37,659
is currently not one of the companies that are
courting Warner Brothers Discovery to attain

86
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:44,300
their content. That said Amazon is huge it has
their fingers in a bunch of different pies

87
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:50,460
including movie studios like MGM including
publishing which I think would be great for DC

88
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,660
comics. And really that's why you picked this
answer as the no prize. Right because I'm

89
00:08:54,660 --> 00:09:00,460
terrified that movie studios will only want to
focus on movies and not really care about the

90
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:05,860
comics. I think if anyone were to have the best
interests of the publishing aspect of DC it would

91
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:12,560
be a company like Amazon. Yeah I'm not sure if like
Comcast Universal or Paramount or any of the other

92
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,220
studios have strong publishing arms. I know that
like Netflix doesn't right because they focus on

93
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:22,560
movies solely but yeah whoever ends up acquiring
Warner Brothers and therefore DC would also be

94
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,240
acquiring the publishing division and you would
want to make sure that that's in good hands because

95
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,980
you know that's the source of all this movie and TV
show content is the comic books. Exactly so great

96
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,520
answer by dear you win this week's no prize if you
the listener want a shot at winning your own no

97
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:43,220
prize. Stay tuned to later on in this episode when
we'll be asking another question of the week. And

98
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:52,840
now that that's done I want to the question of the
week. Now that peacemaker has come out and we've

99
00:09:52,840 --> 00:10:01,160
gone through all of the Marvel and DC shows coming
out in 2025 which Marvel or DC movie or TV show from

100
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,760
this year has been your favorite and why. Yeah
there was a number of DC and Marvel projects to come

101
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,680

and move on to the main event of this episode a team

113
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:48,600
duel between the hardcore super teams of DC's
authority and Marvel's cabal. Okay the authority

114
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:55,020
and the cabal as I mentioned earlier these are two
hardcore bad ass super teams who don't take no guff

115
00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:01,360
from nobody. Yeah I mean the cabal got quite good at
destroying entire universes leading up to the

116
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:08,120
events of secret wars where they were ensuring the
survival of Marvel 616 at the expense of all the

117
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,400
other realities and the multiverse. Yeah and the
authority is no stranger to destroying planets as

118
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:20,040
well. The authority is a team of good guys but they
play by bad guy rules they're all anti heroes and

119
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,920
they are supposed to be getting a movie within the
DC cinematic universe led by James Gunn I wonder if

120
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,500
that's still gonna happen. Well we did see one of
the members of the authority the engineer in the

121
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:37,060
Superman movie that came out this past summer. The
authority was supposed to originally be the

122
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:43,620
second movie that was released under the gods and
monsters phase one essentially of the DC universe

123
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:50,200
that's changed I'm not sure when we're going to get
an authority film rumor has it that it's been

124
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:56,280
transitioned from live action into an animated
project but we'll see. Interesting interesting.

125
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:02,140
Of course we've seen a number of members from the
cabal in live action including Emma Frost, Dr.

126
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:09,280
Doom, the Submariner and recently The Hood and
Loki and Norman Osborn yeah basically Marvel is

127
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,620
just really on top of things when it comes to
getting their characters depicted in live

128
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:20,880
action. Unless it's Modoc then they suck. That's
true that's true Modoc being a member of the cabal

129
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,500
not in the comic books but in the cartoon and video
game space. I'll get into the rosters later on but

130
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:32,440
first to explain the methodology behind our duels
let's go to our sentient duel simulator Alfred

131
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:38,020
Jarvis 9000. AG9K tell our listeners how you go
about determining a winner in our team duel

132
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:44,140
matchups. Yes of course sir the way I determine a
winner between the two teams is by running 1000

133
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:49,500
Monte Carlo simulations between every character
on each team using their statistics. A Monte Carlo

134
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,720
simulation is a probabilistic model used to
determine outcomes through random sampling. In

135
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,880
this case I randomize the statistics along a
normal distribution as a way to simulate the many

136
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,860
variables that can occur during battle. The stat
parameters are based on the official Marvel power

137
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:10,140
grid from which the DC characters statistics are
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are

138
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:15,720
included such as range, damage potential,
versatility and perception in order to create a

139
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,020
more detailed and accurate simulation. The
results of the 49,000 simulations provide a

140
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:26,040
percentage of wins for each character on both
teams. The team with the higher average win rate is

141
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,380
declared the victor as they have a higher
probability to win any given battle. In an

142
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:35,640
equitable pairing neither team should win 100% of
the matches. The comic book stories have shown

143
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,300
that there's even a way for Batman to defeat
Superman so the confidence rate of my method falls

144
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,040
in line with the precedents that have been
established in the source material. My

145
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,660
mathematical simulations are without
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole

146
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:55,580
consideration nor are fan votes tabulated for
determination of the winner. Thanks a J9K. Before

147
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,440
we run the simulations though we like to break down
each team's histories and rosters before

148
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:06,780
improvising a scenario on how we imagine one of the
thousands of simulations would play out beat for

149
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:13,020
beat. It's my turn to go first with the DC team's
backstory so let me tell you all about the

150
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:19,460
authority. Now before the rise of the authority,
Earth's defense against extraterrestrial and

151
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:25,120
metahuman threats was managed by Stormwatch, a
United Nations crisis intervention force

152
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,880
headquartered aboard the satellite Skywatch.
Under the command of successive weathermen

153
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:37,180
including the manipulative Henry Bendix,
Stormwatch operated publicly but also covertly

154
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:43,400
through Black Ops teams like Stormwatch Black,
composed of Jenny Sparks, the spirit of the 20th

155
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:49,180
century who could manipulate electricity and
technology, Jack Hawksmore, a man biologically

156
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:55,460
engineered to bond with cities and draw power from
urban environments, and Swift, a Tibetan

157
00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:01,940
meta-avian capable of high-speed flight and
combat. When Skywatch fell and most of Stormwatch

158
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:08,880
perished in an alien attack, its surviving covert
members abandoned the UN Charter and reformed

159
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,220
independently. From the ashes of Stormwatch, the
authority was born, a new team with a goal of

160
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:21,140
changing the world by any means necessary.
Joining them were Angela Spieke, the second

161
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:26,740
engineer who replaced her blood with
nanotechnology and became a living machine,

162
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:33,300
Jerome Thorndike, the latest doctor and wielder
of Earth's shamanistic magic lineage, and two

163
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:39,940
enhanced operatives rescued from Stormwatch
Zero. Apollo, a solar-powered superhuman with

164
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:46,220
strength and flight rivaling Superman, and
Midniter, a brutal hand-to-hand combatant with a

165
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:51,420
cybernetic brain that could predict every
possible move in a fight. The team discovered and

166
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:56,860
took residents aboard the Carrier, a sentient
interdimensional vessel capable of traversing

167
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:02,440
the multiverse through the bleed. The authority
made their debut, repelling the global assault of

168
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:08,180
Kaizen Gamora, who unleashed his engineered
super soldiers, the children of Gamora, across

169
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:14,420
major cities. The team predicted and intercepted
Gamora's final strike in Los Angeles, and

170
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:20,140
Midniter destroyed his cloning facility using
the Carrier. Their next threat came from sliding

171
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:26,020
Albion, an imperialistic version of Britain from
a parallel universe born from human alien

172
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,880
interbreeding. The Carrier breached their
dimension and the authority dismantled their

173
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:38,680
regime from within. In 1999, as the millennium
ended, Earth's original creator, a vast god-like

174
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:44,760
entity, returned to reclaim and terraform the
planet. The team infiltrated the being's

175
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:50,720
colossal form, and Jenny Sparks electrocuted it
from within its brain, ending the threat at the

176
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:57,680
cost of her life. As the spirit of the 20th century,
her death marked the end of her era, and leadership

177
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:04,620
of the team passed to Jack Coxmore. The authority
retrieved Jenny Quantum, a newborn in Singapore,

178
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:10,320
in the spirit of the 21st century, who had been
abducted by Medi-human engineer Dr. Jake Gip

179
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:16,800
Krikstein. Swift negotiated her release in
exchange for his services aboard the Carrier.

180
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:22,900
Soon after, the Earth's magnetic poles began to
reverse due to a former doctor who had succumbed to

181
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,640
despair. The authority evacuated Earth's
population to alternate Earth's to prevent

182
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:33,240
extinction, and when the rogue doctor was
overcome by empathy, he became vulnerable and was

183
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,680
killed by Apollo and the engineer, allowing
Earth's population to return safely. The

184
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:44,060
authority's global interventions attracted
opposition from the G7 nations. They dispatched

185
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:50,240
Seth, a being engineered with over a thousand
powers who defeated the entire team except

186
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,800
Midnighter. While the others were captured and
replaced with government-created duplicates,

187
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,660
Midnighter escaped with baby Jenny, freed
Apollo, and together they eliminated the

188
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:07,340
imposters. Jenny Quantum, now of speaking age,
activated a fail-safe that neutralized Seth's

189
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:13,220
abilities. The team was restored and Apollo and
Midnighter were married, adopting Jenny as their

190
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,600
daughter. They next confronted Reality
Incorporated, a multiversal corporate entity

191
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:28,980
that attempted to colonize Earth for profit, as
well as a charismatic Medi-human named John Clay,

192
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:34,760
who most of the team was affected. Midnighter and
the doctor resisted, the latter managing to purge

193
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:40,180
Clay's influence to end the crisis. In the
aftermath, the doctor founded the Church of the

194
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:45,860
Shaman to meet the world's growing spiritual
hunger. When the US military triggered a rift in

195
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:51,920
the bleed causing the destruction of Florida, the
authority staged a bloodless coup and assumed

196
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,580
control of the United States to enact reform and
prevent further catastrophe. Soon after Jenny

197
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:03,600
Quantum was targeted by her twin sister Jenny
Fractal, a genetically altered assassin raised

198
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,980
in secret by the Chinese government. Fractal
murdered Jenny, but the doctor preserved her

199
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:14,460
soul. Midnighter traveled back in time and
eliminated the infant Fractal, allowing Jenny

200
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:19,540
Quantum's spirit to inhabit her sister's body.
The authority's government collapsed when the

201
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:24,840
Sons of Liberty, a team of superhumans from
earlier generations, incited nationwide

202
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:30,100
rebellion. During the conflict, a
nuclear-powered sun detonated on the White House

203
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:35,940
lawn, destroying much of Washington, DC.
Disillusioned, the authority disbanded. Jenny

204
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:42,420
Quantum, now eight, ventured into the infinite
city, a realm inhabited by past Jennies, where she

205
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:48,660
met Jenny Sparks and resolved to rebuild the team.
Jenny Quantum aged herself into adolescence and

206
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:53,860
reassembled the authority to challenge a
resurgent Henry Bendix, who had orchestrated

207
00:20:53,860 --> 00:21:00,560
their downfall. Bendix had corrupted a woman
named Rose Tattoo into the spirit of murder and

208
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:06,000
used her to assassinate the doctor, while a
president his successor, Habib bin Hassan.

209
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,740
During Bendix's confrontation with the
authority, he manipulated Midnighter to turn

210
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:16,680
against his team. Engineer and Jenny Quantum
disabled the threat, and Midnighter executed

211
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:24,760
Bendix. Hassan, as the new doctor, purified Rose
Tattoo into the spirit of life who joined the team.

212
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:30,060
The authority then encountered Captain Adam,
displaced from the DC universe, who you can learn

213
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:36,340
more about in our Captain Adam vs Wonderman duel
episode. Though they sought to return him home,

214
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:42,680
his unstable energies threatened to unravel
their universe's reality. As reality collapsed,

215
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:48,480
Captain Adam killed Apollo, Midnighter, and
Jenny Quantum, before the hero Void extracted

216
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:54,520
part of her essence from him, triggering a
universal reboot. You can learn more about Void in

217
00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:01,080
our Wildcats vs Inhumans team duel. In the newly
formed universe, the authority crash landed in a

218
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:06,860
parallel world devoid of metahuman life. They
faced a lovecraftian creature at the bottom of the

219
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:12,020
ocean that psychically fed on the planet's
collective unconscious fears. Though the doctor

220
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:17,880
destroyed it using a local human as a conduit, the
act wiped out all life on the planet, and the

221
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,780
authority departed the dead world aboard the
carrier. When the number of the beast program

222
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:29,340
initiated a reality damaging event, the carrier
crashed into London, forming the city of

223
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:35,300
Unlondon. Earth became a poisoned wasteland,
Jack Hawksmore was gravely injured, the engineer

224
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:41,260
disabled by electromagnetic storms, and Apollo
exiled to the upper atmosphere to escape the

225
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:47,920
toxicity. Midnighter roamed the devastated
surface, while Swift operated as a scout.

226
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:53,700
Survivors mutated into monstrous incubates from
exposure to the Warhol virus, while Apollo became

227
00:22:53,700 --> 00:23:00,380
infected and was later frozen for safety. Kaizen
Gamora resurfaced with a mobile city, seeking to

228
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:05,540
harness authority technology. Swift and the
engineer were kidnapped by Prince Lorenzo of

229
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:11,340
Sliding Albion, who sought to harvest their
technology, but the two escaped and rescued a long

230
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:18,220
lost member of the Golden, a powerful ancient race
once allied with humanity. Jack, merged with

231
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:24,240
Gamora Island's infrastructure, regained his
powers and repelled the invasion. Apollo,

232
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,100
thought and infected, was released to aid in the
final battle. Midnighter discovered that Habib

233
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:36,960
bin Hassan, now calling himself the Green Man, had
to become unhinged. The authority rescued Gaia, a

234
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:42,840
new century baby, who gifted Midnighter a
restorative apple. He used it to cure Apollo,

235
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:48,360
reuniting them, and once the carrier was fully
restored, Jack offered humanity refuge aboard

236
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:54,040
the vessel, and a new authority team was formed to
lead the Exodus. During the voyage, they

237
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:59,740
encountered the Caribbna, an alien race that
consumed living beings for energy. With the help

238
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:06,040
of a sentient brain, the surviving remnants of an
alien species that fell victim to the Caribbna,

239
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:11,340
the authority defeated them and liberated the
captive species. Returning to Earth during a

240
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:18,360
rampage from Gaia, Shift, as the new Doctor,
managed to calm her down and end the threat.

241
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:24,940
Following the Flashpoint event, the Wildstorm
and DC universes merged. In this new reality, a

242
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:30,540
previous version of the authority had existed,
with Jenny Sparks and the Doctor operating in

243
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:37,480
secret. A new incarnation emerged when Superman,
weakened by alien radiation, sought allies to

244
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:43,440
liberate Warworld from Mongol. Superman's first
recruit was the powerful telepath, Manchester

245
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,720
Black, whose injuries were healed in exchange for
service. They rescued June Moon from a magical

246
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:55,560
prison, adding Enchantress to the team, who you
can learn more about in her duel against Marvel's

247
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:01,080
Enchantress. Apollo and Midnighter joined for
their strength and precision, while Natasha

248
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:08,000
Irons, Steel's niece who adopted his mantle, came
aboard as a tech expert. Light Ray, an alternate

249
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,300
universe's version of the Flash, was recruited
for her light speed travel, and an Omec android was

250
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:20,460
added as a living weapon. The team's first mission
went to Rai when Omec attacked Apollo during an

251
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:26,020
attempt to retrieve Light Ray, imprisoned by
Eclipsus. Meanwhile, Superman was trapped in the

252
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:31,560
bottle city of Kandor by Ultra Humanite, who
planned to possess his body. Superman escaped

253
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:37,300
with help from Brainiac, who delayed humanites'
plans. You can learn more about Brainiac and Ultra

254
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:43,180
Humanite in their duel episodes against Ultron
and Mr. Sinister respectively. As the team

255
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:48,680
regrouped, Apollo and Enchantress and Omec
succeeded in freeing Light Ray. With their roster

256
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:55,020
complete, the Authority departed Earth in a new
carrier and launched an assault on Warworld and

257
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:00,840
its tyrannical ruler, Mongul, who you can learn
more about in our Mongul vs. Annihilus episode. In

258
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:06,660
their opening engagement, Light Ray was killed
and Apollo gravely wounded. Most of the team was

259
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:12,200
captured, leaving only Midnighter free to
initiate a rebellion that eventually led to

260
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:18,420
Mongul's death and the liberation of Warworld.
And that's the Authority's history so far. Now for

261
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:23,960
my seven member roster, I'm going with the
original team members of Jenny Sparks, Jack

262
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:31,020
Hawksmore, Swift, Engineer, Doctor, Apollo, and
Midnighter. Jenny Sparks is the cynical spirit of

263
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:35,740
the 20th century who commands electricity, is
able to travel through power lines, fire

264
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:42,500
lightning, and transform into energy. Jack
Hawksmore is a post-human urban avatar whose

265
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:48,740
cybernetic body draws power from cities, giving
him enhanced senses, leaping phasing, and even

266
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:55,700
control over the urban landscape itself. Swift is
a Tibetan-born metahuman with avian traits,

267
00:26:55,700 --> 00:27:01,560
including talons, supersonic flight enhanced
senses, and a psychic rapport with birds. The

268
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:07,660
Engineer is a genius nanotech cyborg with liquid
metal blood that allows her to shapeshift,

269
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:14,640
self-replicate, fabricate weapons, manipulate
tech, and alter her size. The Doctor is Earth's

270
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:20,780
shamanistic protector with reality-warping
magic drawn from the collective memory of all who

271
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:26,780
have ever lived, granting him near-limitless
power and wisdom. Apollo is a solar-powered

272
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:32,280
powerhouse with super strength, durability, and
speed, as well as the ability to fly and emit

273
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:37,840
energy. His husband, Midnighter, is a
bio-engineered super-soldier and master

274
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,160
tactician with an arsenal of club and edged
weaponry, as well as enhanced strength,

275
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:49,220
reflexes, healing, and the ability to predict
every possible outcome of a fight before it

276
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:55,340
begins. That's the Authority. With as many times
as their planet went to shit in the history of the

277
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:00,840
team, I'm not convinced that they're going to be
able to hold up to the cabal. Every time I went to

278
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,820
shit, it was not really their fault, and they kind
of rescued it. Excuses, excuses. I don't want

279
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:11,580
their excuses. I think the team's going to be in big
trouble in this matchup, and let me tell you why by

280
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:18,280
going into the history of the cabal. The Skrulls, a
shapeshifting alien race secretly infiltrated

281
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,680
Earth over years by replacing key heroes,
politicians, and leaders with imposters,

282
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:28,680
believing their infiltration fulfilled a
prophecy to make Earth their new homeworld. The

283
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:33,700
invasion erupted into full-scale war between
them and Earth's protectors when their deception

284
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:40,700
was exposed. This war culminated in the public
execution of the Skrull Queen Varanke by Norman

285
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:46,420
Osborn, who at the time led the Thunderbolts and
was suppressing his Green Goblin persona through

286
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:51,980
medication. You can learn more about Osborn in our
Joker vs Green Goblin Duel and more about the

287
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:57,220
Thunderbolts in their duel against the Watchmen.
Following the secret invasion, Norman Osborn

288
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:02,920
parlayed his superheroic actions into
unprecedented political capital. He was given

289
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:07,460
command of National Superhuman Security after
the international espionage organization

290
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:34,770
Shield was dismantled and he began a new one called
Hammer. Osborn seized Avengers to have Ozborn's

291
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:40,510
Council, soon known as the Cabal, contained
influential villains from around the world. Its

292
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:47,010
initial inclusions were the Submariner, Emma
Frost, Dr. Doom, Loki, and the Hood, the latter of

293
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:52,410
whom's real name was Parker Robbins, a small-time
criminal who gained mystical powers after

294
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:58,230
stealing a cloak and boots from a slain demon
servant of Dormammu. The cloak granted the Hood

295
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:03,830
invisibility, levitation, and limited mystical
energy projection, making him a formidable

296
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:08,770
street-level crime boss with supernatural
power. Ozborn's arrangement promised each

297
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:14,350
member of the Cabal a path to their ambitions in
exchange for supporting his regime and answering

298
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:19,930
his summons when called. Ozborn's pitch tailored
incentives to each conspirator. He sought

299
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:25,330
Frost's telepathy to help keep the table's liars
honest, while capitalizing on her leadership

300
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:30,430
stature among mutants. He expected Doom to
normalize relations between Liberia and the

301
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:35,050
United States through a personal understanding.
He demanded that the Hood register his criminal

302
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:39,290
army on the streets through government channels
so they could be deployed under Thunderbolt's

303
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:45,130
control. He agreed to advance Loki's designs on
Asgard's throne and help return the realm to the

304
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:50,810
heavens, as, at the time, Asgard was in the skies
above Oklahoma after being rebuilt following the

305
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:57,470
events of Ragnarok. You can learn more about this
in our Aries vs. Loki duel. Finally, he dangled the

306
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:02,310
surface world's cooperation with Atlantis
before Namor, something that the shield had never

307
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:08,710
offered. Even as the Cabal nodded along, power
dynamics behind the scenes remained volatile.

308
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:14,490
Ozborn quietly held a deterrent in reserve, the
sentry's destructive other self known as the

309
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:19,910
Void, threatening to unleash him should any
member of the Cabal betray him. Even at its

310
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:25,670
inception, the group's alliances nested within
alliances. Namor and Dr. Doom, long comfortable

311
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:31,010
dealing at sovereigns beyond ordinary law,
renewed their understanding when Ozborn

312
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:38,170
inevitably imploded, Doom would rule the land and
Namor the seas. Emma Frost and Namor, whose brief

313
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:43,250
past romance had been revealed during an earlier
attempt to recruit him into the Hellfire Club,

314
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:49,490
forged a new pact with clear contingencies. Frost
promised to protect Namor's psyche from Ozborn's

315
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:55,170
coercion, while Namor vowed to stand for mutant
kind if Frost needed him. You can learn more about

316
00:31:55,170 --> 00:32:00,530
Namor and Frost and their respective duels
against Aquaman and Poison Ivy. Loki moved first

317
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:06,270
to hasten Ozborn's downfall while empowering
himself. On the geopolitical front, Loki courted

318
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:12,830
Doom with a bargain to relocate Asgard from
Oklahoma to Liberia, provided Thor was banished,

319
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:17,790
a condition that Doom imposed to ensure his realm
did not inherit the God of Thunder. In the

320
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:22,490
super-criminal underworld, the hood's mystical
connection to Dormammu was severed when

321
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:28,330
sorcerers including Dr. Strange and Dr. Voodoo
purged the demon's influence and his signature

322
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:34,770
cloak was lost in battle. Loki exploited the
vacuum, leading the hood and Madamask to Cuba to

323
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:41,150
recover the Asgardian Nornstones, restoring the
hood's power and making him indebted to Loki. Each

324
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:46,190
maneuver weakened Ozborn's stability by army
gactors whose loyalties lay with Loki's long game

325
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:51,110
rather than with Hammer. Within mutant politics,
Frost set conditions that would determine

326
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:57,430
whether the cabal fractured or endured. As Ozborn
moved to contain the X-Men by constructing a Dark

327
00:32:57,430 --> 00:33:02,570
counterpart team under his authority, similar to
the Dark Avengers. This led to intensified

328
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:07,630
friction with Namor, who called on an Atlantean
terrorist cell that in turn prompted a

329
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:12,230
heavy-handed response from Hammer. Namor's
cousin Namor interfered against Ozborn's

330
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:17,650
horses, also deepening the rift. When the moment
came, Emma Frost revealed herself as a double

331
00:33:17,650 --> 00:33:23,110
agent to the cabal after discovering Charles
Xavier had been tortured in Hammer custody. With

332
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:28,450
Namor at her side, she turned the Dark X-Men
confrontation into a rout, publicly

333
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:33,810
undercutting Ozborn's claim to control mutant
affairs and forcing him to accept the new mutant

334
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:40,130
nation of Utopia near San Francisco, despite his
orders that Namor's head and Frost's heart be

335
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:45,790
brought to him as trophies. As cracks widened,
Ozborn's control faltered even within the

336
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:50,870
cabal's council chamber. A confrontation with
Doom escalated until the L'Averian ruler

337
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:56,350
retaliated with a bio-weapon attack on Avengers
Tower and then walked away from the arrangement,

338
00:33:56,350 --> 00:34:01,850
forcing Ozborn to bring Taskmaster on board. When
Dr. Doom later demanded the Submariner honor

339
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:07,470
their agreement, Ozborn unveiled the terrible
deterrent he had hinted at from the start, the

340
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:13,770
Void. The Void hurled Doom through a wall, but it
was actually a Doombot who dissolved into swarms

341
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:20,370
of mechanical scarabs that overran Avengers
Tower, forcing the Dark Avengers into retreat.

342
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:25,190
The spectacle exposed Ozborn's dependence on
intimidation and the brittleness of a coalition

343
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:30,530
held together by threats. The cabal's reputation
among villains did not translate into lasting

344
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:36,070
leverage. For example, the groups perceived
influence encouraged even warlords such as

345
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:42,370
Dracula to seek latitude for his European
conquests through Doom, arrangements that Doom

346
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:48,370
refused to indulge. However, the broader villain
community ultimately turned against Ozborn due

347
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:54,830
to his own escalation. The act of his dark reign
over the superpowered populace culminated in an

348
00:34:54,830 --> 00:35:00,690
attempted siege of Asgard itself. The overreach
shattered the state façade that had shielded

349
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:06,430
Ozborn and he was brought down by the combined
efforts of Earth's heroes and public scrutiny.

350
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:11,670
Ozborn was imprisoned, the Hood and Taskmaster
were apprehended, Loki's body was destroyed in

351
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:17,550
the battle, Emmafrost and Namor returned to their
ranks and Doom resumed uncontested rule in

352
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:23,710
Latteria. With its architect disgraced and its
member scattered, the cabal disbanded. However,

353
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:28,510
years later a new iteration emerged from a
different ethical crisis. The Illuminati were

354
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:33,890
forced to confront apocalyptic collisions
between universes called incursions that could

355
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:39,610
only be averted by destroying one of the Earth's
involved. For a time, the Illuminati bore that

356
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:45,130
burden, but the moral cost grew intolerable.
Everyone but Namor refused to continue

357
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:50,290
annihilating other worlds to save their own.
Concluding that survival required the will to do

358
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:55,770
what the others would not, Namor assembled a new
cabal of beings for whom extinction level of

359
00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:02,130
violence was an acceptable instrument of policy.
This included Thanos and his Black Order, whom

360
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:06,550
you've learned more about in their duel against
Darkseid's elite. In contrast to Ozborn's

361
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:11,490
backroom government, this version of the cabal
was an operational death squad, aimed at

362
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:16,830
preserving a single Earth at the expense of all
others. This new group prosecuted its campaign

363
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:22,610
with Muthas efficiency. Where the Illuminati had
agonized, Namor's cabal acted, detonating

364
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:28,610
worlds and leaving entire realities in ruins.
Namor's actions destroyed his old alliances. He

365
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:33,910
didn't just abandon the heroes' methods, he
rejected their entire sense of morality. Each

366
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:39,210
successful destruction forestalled the next
incursion at the price of incalculable deaths,

367
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:44,430
and each victory pushed Namor deeper into
reliance on his new allies, whose goals of cosmic

368
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:49,450
domination and nihilistic balance diverged
sharply from his own. As the final worlds

369
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:54,870
collapsed toward a final incursion, Namor
ensured that his cabal would not perish with the

370
00:36:54,870 --> 00:37:00,790
dying worlds. Anticipating the end, they secured
passage aboard a specially designed life pod unit

371
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:06,770
built by an alternate reality, Reed Richards, a
vessel capable of withstanding the universe's

372
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:13,350
unraveling. Reality gave way into the battle
world, a patchwork planet ruled by Dr. Doom and

373
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:19,090
composed of various worlds from throughout the
multiverse. The cabal endured the journey there,

374
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:24,630
but they disbanded as Thanos abandoned their
goals to instead make an attempt for Dr. Doom's

375
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:31,190
newfound power, only to have his spine ripped out.
And that's the cabal's history. For the person

376
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:36,930
roster, I'm choosing to forgo some of the key
members, such as Norman Osborn, who was part of our

377
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:43,690
Sinister Six team duel, Namor, who was part of the
Fantastic Four duel, and Thanos, who was part of

378
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:50,010
the Black Order duel. But I am including the
original members of Dr. Doom, Emma Frost, the

379
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:56,530
White Queen, Loki, and the Hood. To round out the
remaining spots, I'm going with two villains who

380
00:37:56,530 --> 00:38:02,650
are members of the cabal in the Avengers Assemble
cartoon, and the contest of champions video game,

381
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:08,630
and that is Red Skull and Modoc. For the seventh and
final spot, I'm going with a villain who is also a

382
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:14,690
member of the cabal in the cartoons, and that is the
Hulk's arch nemesis, the leader, who started out

383
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:20,630
as a janitor named Samuel Stearns, who was exposed
to gamma radiation at the chemical plant where he

384
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:26,410
worked. It granted him superhuman intelligence
and an enlarged cranium, making him as smart as the

385
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:32,510
Hulk was strong. He possessed a genius-level IQ,
perfect memory, and the ability to process

386
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:37,510
information and devise strategies far beyond
human capability. He can communicate

387
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:44,090
telepathically, move objects with telekinesis,
and can emit gamma radiation blasts from his head.

388
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:49,410
He has built advanced technology including laser
pistols, kinetic absorption gauntlets, and

389
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:55,790
teleportation devices. So that's my team to
reiterate you're going up against Dr. Doom,

390
00:38:55,790 --> 00:39:26,190
Ammafrost, Loki, the Hood, Red Skull, Modoc, and
the leader. In a world where fantasies collide and

heroes clash, one podcast network rises above the

Duel. Now that we got the team's histories and

405
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:59,990
rosters out of the way, let's speculate on how one
of the thousands of simulated matches will go

406
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:04,650
between them. The winners determined by
simulations, not the speculation, but it's fun to

407
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:10,730
imagine how the fight could play out. AG9K, what
are the rules of our speculation? Well, I should

408
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:15,970
say there are no rules, other than the teams have no
prior knowledge of the other going into the fight.

409
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:21,310
All they are aware of starting out is that the other
side is a threat that needs to be eliminated. For

410
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:25,870
the speculation, the groups will begin
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript

411
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:30,930
environment that will have no bearing on the match
itself, as no environmental statistics are

412
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:36,290
considered in my simulations. The teams must earn
victory on their own merit. Alright then, let's

413
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:43,110
get into it. The authority and the cabal meet on the
battlefield. Who goes first? I'm gonna say that

414
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:49,050
Emma Frost starts out. She's gonna scan the minds
of every member of the authority, and she's gonna

415
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:55,790
be like, holy crap, I thought we were fucked up
guys. But she delivers all the details to every

416
00:41:55,790 --> 00:42:02,010
other member of the cabal, psychically. Okay, so
the Garden of Ancestral Memory is going to warn the

417
00:42:02,010 --> 00:42:07,910
doctor that he's being brain scanned. And since
all of the members of the authority wear this radio

418
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:13,830
telepathic nanotech device on their temporal
lobe, the doctor is able to warn all of them that

419
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:20,350
Emma Frost is psychically scanning them. And so
Jenny Sparks is gonna tell Swift telepathically

420
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:27,310
to take out Emma Frost. So Swift jets toward her at
hyper speed, Talon's first, and she just slashes

421
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:32,590
her to rubens. Yeah, it's too bad that the cabal do
everything about the authority now, and they knew

422
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:39,110
about the nanotech device, and they anticipated
Swift's attack. Because Emma Frost just turns

423
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:45,090
into Diamond. And so Swift isn't scratching shit.
And Modoc, he's just gonna straight up

424
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:50,570
disintegrate Swift with an energy beam from his
headband. So now the authority know that the cabal

425
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:57,110
aren't fucking around. Damn, like that, huh?
Okay. Well, the authority also does not fuck

426
00:42:57,110 --> 00:43:02,650
around. And they're gonna let the cabal know that
by having the engineer duplicate herself into

427
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:09,290
like six other engineers who all form their
forearms into machine guns, and start firing at

428
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:16,110
the cabal laying down suppressive fire while
Apollo is going to speed bullets Dr. Doom and

429
00:43:16,110 --> 00:43:23,430
punches 10 head right off of his body. Force field.
Dr. Doom blocks both the bullets from the engineer

430
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:31,930
and Apollo's attack with a dome force field. And so
the authority are trying to get inside this force

431
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:37,530
field dome, but it fills up with green smoke hiding
every member of the cabal that's inside of it.

432
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:44,270
Except that Jack Hawksmore, he's also known as the
king of cities. He has this spatial sense that

433
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:49,690
allows him to see what they're doing within the
green smoke. And with each of their locations

434
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:57,070
pinpointed within, he's going to cause the ground
directly beneath them to quickly just launch

435
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:02,590
upwards, slamming all of them into the ceiling of
the dome shield. And it's going to knock all of them

436
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:08,250
out, as well as bring down the force field. Oh, oh,
he thinks so, huh? Yeah, when the force field

437
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:13,470
dissipates and the green smoke clears away, the
only thing that's left there is a green snake that

438
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:19,310
grows into the size of like a freight train.
Because the hood teleported every member of the

439
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:24,450
cabal out of the force field just in time, except
for Loki, who was providing a distraction with the

440
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:30,670
smoke and shape shifting into a giant serpent. And
that snake is just going to wrap around Apollo and

441
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:38,090
devour him whole. Okay, well, that snake and Loki,
I guess, is going to explode in this blinding light

442
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:44,870
of energy from Apollo from within. And with Jack
able to sense the cabal teleporting probably

443
00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:50,710
behind them, he's able to warn the others. And
Jenny Sparks generates this powerful arc of

444
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:55,810
electricity that chains to all of them and
electrocutes them. Yeah, yeah, Jack thinks he's

445
00:44:55,810 --> 00:45:01,290
able to sense the cabal behind him, but only
because of a psychic suggestion by Amarfrost.

446
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:05,790
Jack doesn't really know anything. He's been
manipulated this whole time. In reality, Jenny

447
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:11,610
doesn't hit anything with her electricity. And
when the cabal do reappear from the hood's

448
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:16,890
teleportation, they're actually surrounding
the authority on all sides, including Loki. He

449
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:22,350
didn't actually get blown up. It was just an
illusion diversion. And the red skull shoots from

450
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:29,030
a gas gun, his dust of death compound at midnight,
which poisons midnight and just desiccates his

451
00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:36,190
face into a red skull killing him. Midnighter is
going to calculate what red skull is about to do. So

452
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:41,430
just before red skull pulls the trigger on his gas
gun, midnighters going to hurl his night stick

453
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:48,570
into Red skull's chest area with enough force that
it impales him. That's going to cause the red skull

454
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:54,190
to squeeze his trigger as he gets knocked
backward. And he ends up spraying the white queen

455
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:59,830
in the face, desiccating her and causing her to
die. Well, that's stupid. Two birds with one

456
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:05,190
stone, I guess. That's right. But the hood is going
to go for the same. He said he's going to up the game

457
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:10,870
by shooting hellfire bullets from his twin
pistols that are going to curve and hit Jenny

458
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:17,170
Sparks and Midnighter and to the doctor all in one
shot. Oh, no worries. The doctor, he's going to

459
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:24,010
transmute those bullets into butterflies and
Jack causes a massive geyser to erupt beneath the

460
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:29,810
hood that's going to launch him into the air with
boiling hot water. Hot water is not going to affect

461
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:34,810
the hood. You know, he's like partially possessed
by a demon while wearing the cloak. I don't think

462
00:46:34,810 --> 00:46:39,810
boiling water is going to hurt him if he's not hurt
by like fire, you know, the hood is just going to

463
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:45,550
teleport off this geyser and then in his demon
form, he's just going to eviscerate Jack

464
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:52,810
Hawksmore. So Jack is out and then Dr. Doom shoots
an electric blast that fries the engineer

465
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:59,150
circuits. So she's out too. I'm sorry. Jenny
Sparks controls electricity, like all

466
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:05,450
electricity around them. So she redirects that
blast toward Modoc, which fries his circuits and

467
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:10,910
shuts him down. So he's out of the match.
Meanwhile, the doctor seeing the hood demon

468
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:18,590
exercises the demon using knowledge from an old
priest. And with the hood depowered, the doctor is

469
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:26,610
going to cause him to just melt into a puddle. So
he's out as well. Okay. Well, Jenny, she suddenly

470
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:33,750
gets a dagger in the back by Loki, who snuck over to
her and stabbed her. And then he teleports over to

471
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:41,030
Midnighter and freezes him with an ice blast.
Okay, well, Apollo doesn't appreciate that. So

472
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:47,410
he's going to fly over and land between Loki and
Midnighter, generating this blending flash of

473
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:54,630
light to stun Loki before picking up and flying off
with Midnighter to thaw him with heat energy.

474
00:47:54,630 --> 00:48:00,410
Meanwhile, the engineer is going to go up against
Dr. Doom, and they're going to be exchanging laser

475
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:07,390
blasts as a distraction while her duplicates
maneuver behind him and infect his suit, shutting

476
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:14,510
it down. You don't think that Doom has protection
from nanite invasion? Like his systems have their

477
00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:21,710
own like mini nano Doom bots that would prevent
such an attack like this. They stop the shutdown,

478
00:48:21,710 --> 00:48:27,630
and then in fact, they remotely hack the
engineer's technology, infecting her with a

479
00:48:27,630 --> 00:48:33,490
virus into her system that turns into like this
uncontrollable swarm of malfunctioning nano

480
00:48:33,490 --> 00:48:40,580
bots. I'm sorry, you don't think engineer has
protection against other nanites? I say it's a

481
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:46,490
Doom's nano bots that get the virus, infecting his
system and causing all of his armor, like even his

482
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:52,130
helmet, to fall off revealing his ugly mug. You
can't just repeat my attack. You just literally

483
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:57,650
did what I did. I say Doom's nanite attack is
superior. You say otherwise. So it looks like we

484
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:01,830
just have a stalemate, which means that Doom and
the engineer are just going to be glitching each

485
00:49:01,830 --> 00:49:07,650
other in attempts to hack each other with nano
bots. Meanwhile, while that's happening, the

486
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:13,330
leader, he's going to mind control Apollo into
crushing Midnighter like a grape, just turning

487
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:20,790
him into this paste that will take way too long for
Midnighter to heal from. Oh damn. Okay. Well, I

488
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:26,610
guess to prevent the leader from controlling
Apollo into killing everyone else on his team, the

489
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:32,870
doctor is going to have to kill his own teammate by
sucking all of the light and energy away from

490
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:39,450
Apollo with this magic black hole, which is also
going to pull him in. But the doctor is also going to

491
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:45,270
maneuver that black hole over to Loki as well,
vanishing him from the match before sealing that

492
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:53,750
black hole closed. Okay. So your guy took out both
Apollo and Loki? Yes. Okay. Uh, well, while that's

493
00:49:53,750 --> 00:50:02,110
going on, Dr. Doom manages to out hack the engineer
by using magic, because he can do magic. She can't.

494
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:08,570
Dr. Doom adds magic to his computer virus that she
can't out hack. So he shuts her down with his magic

495
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:15,510
nano bots. She's out of the match. And then the
leader is going to fire a gamma mental bolt from his

496
00:50:15,510 --> 00:50:21,510
brain that just fries the doctor's mind and sever
his connection to all those other minds in the

497
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:28,630
ancestral garden. Okay. For maybe like a second,
because at the last second, the doctor, he's going

498
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:34,790
to stretch time and that's going to give him enough
time for past doctors in the garden of ancestral

499
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:41,450
memory to help the doctor regain access to his
body, at which point he's just going to transform

500
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:48,990
the leader's head into an actual scrotum with
testes instead of brains. So he's out. And it looks

501
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:55,890
like all we have left is Dr. Doom versus the doctor.
So the doctor is going to end this right away by

502
00:50:55,890 --> 00:51:03,950
having doom be surrounded by his worst nightmare,
a swarm of endless squirrels that devour him whole

503
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:08,730
leaving nothing but his faceplate in the end.
You're talking about when Dr. Doom was allegedly

504
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:15,770
quote unquote defeated by squirrel girl. I mean,
it was not alleged it happened. Well, Dr. Doom,

505
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:20,790
while he's being attacked by the squirrels is
going to remotely activate the time circuitry in

506
00:51:20,790 --> 00:51:27,670
his armor. That's going to rewind time to the point
that the doctor summoned the squirrels and then

507
00:51:27,670 --> 00:51:35,050
doom just casts a mirror spell that results in the
doctor getting eaten alive by his own swarm of

508
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:40,050
squirrels. Okay, you want to play with time? I'm
going to say that doesn't happen. And instead, the

509
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:47,050
doctor actually jumps back in time to when doom was
a newborn baby. And he just kills him in the crib.

510
00:51:47,050 --> 00:51:52,790
No, Doom already has a contingency set up as like
this magic trap for anyone who would try to kill him

511
00:51:52,790 --> 00:52:00,110
as a baby. And so the doctor attempts to do this, but
he just gets deatomized by like a trio of demons.

512
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:06,330
Okay, and then the doctor reatomizes himself and
then kills dooms parents instead. How does he

513
00:52:06,330 --> 00:52:14,050
reatomize himself? This is magic, bitch. But it's
magic deatomization. I guess we have a stalemate

514
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:20,330
here too. It's Dr. Doom's magic versus the
doctor's magic, except that doom is going to out

515
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:26,790
magic the doctor by incorporating science into
his magic, which is something the doctor can't do.

516
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:34,730
So there you go. The cabal wins. Yeah, sorry, magic
trump science. So the cabal loses, in fact. Well,

517
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:38,130
let's go ahead and leave the match there. Let's run
the simulations. We'll find out which one of these

518
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:45,190
scenarios happens. Either Dr. Doom manages to out
time magic the doctor or the doctor manages to out

519
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:51,090
time magic Dr. Doom. It's a weird sentence there,
but let's run the stats and find out what happens.

520
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:57,890
Agenine K hit it. Inputting data, running
calculations, processing results, simulations

521
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:03,770
complete. This was a good one. The authority is
hella powerful, except for Swift, which we'll get

522
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:09,750
into later. The cabal is also hella powerful,
except for Red Skull. So it's kind of probably

523
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:15,650
fitting that we paired up Swift and Red Skull being
as they were by far the weakest members of each of

524
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:23,030
our teams. Right. Yeah, we paired up Swift and Red
Skull. We also paired up Apollo and Dr. Doom sort of

525
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:28,470
in a callback to our Superman versus Dr. Doom
episode. Statwise Midnighter was comparable to

526
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:36,970
the Hood, Jenny Sparks to White Queen, the
Engineer to Modoc and the Doctor to Loki, and Jack

527
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:43,070
Hawksmore to the leader. Yeah, that was not a great
matchup, but that was kind of all that was left. But

528
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:48,990
statwise, as always in our team battles, everyone
went up against everyone else. As we mentioned,

529
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:55,770
Swift was my weakest character. She had an average
win rate of only 12.3%. Yeah, I thought the most

530
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:59,810
powerful member of your team was going to be
Apollo, but it was actually the Doctor. And before

531
00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:04,230
this matchup, I had no idea who the Doctor was.
Yeah, the guy's insanely powerful. He's actually

532
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:09,770
a pretty cool character. I'm glad we pin him up
against Loki. They're both almost omnipotent.

533
00:54:09,770 --> 00:54:15,590
Loki was actually just as powerful as Dr. Doom, who
is incredibly impressive statistically. It's

534
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:20,890
probably why he beat Superman all those years ago.
He's basically like Batman meets Dr. Strange

535
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:25,870
meets Iron Man all rolled up into one. So yeah, Dr.
Doom had quite the impressive win rate winning

536
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:33,810
74.4% of all his matches. Loki won 73.9% of all his
matches. More of the authority characters on my

537
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:41,550
roster had higher win rates than yours. Four of my
guys had average win rates above 50%. Yeah,

538
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:47,150
whereas I only had three, which included Dr. Doom,
Loki, and Modok. Although the leader was right

539
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:53,750
there winning 49.5% of all his matches, so roughly
half. In regards to the overall stat comparison,

540
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:59,710
the authority just wiped the floor with the cabal
when it came to speed. But the cabal totally

541
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:05,150
dominated the authority when it came to
intelligence. There were a lot of master minds on

542
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:10,330
this version of the cabal. So taking all of this
into consideration, Joseph, which team do you

543
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:15,650
think came out on top in this team duel match? I got
to give it to the cabal. How can you not? There's

544
00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:21,350
Doom. You don't bet against Doom. You don't bet
against the Red Skull, Modok, White Queen, Loki,

545
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:27,490
Leader, I just I'm naming everybody now. They're
all fantastic. Who the hell is Jack Hawksmore?

546
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:32,910
That's not even a real name. It's certainly not the
name of someone who deserves to win a match. I mean,

547
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:39,030
his nickname is also the King of Cities. King of
shitties. I don't know what I'm saying. I think

548
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:45,770
that Instagram agrees with me because 51% of our
followers who voted in our poll voted for the

549
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:52,770
cabal. Well, that's now a whole lot at all. Were you
trying to rhyme right there? No. Okay. I mean, any

550
00:55:52,770 --> 00:56:03,210
chance I get? Well, let's find out who won. A.J .9K.
The results, please. The winner in the team duel

551
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:13,950
matchup between the authority and the cabal is the
cabal. Damn straight. What did you say about me

552
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:19,210
learning today earlier? What was that, Jonathan?
Are you going to learn something because the cabal

553
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:29,750
only won 50.6% of the thousands of matches
compared to the authority who won 49.4. This was an

554
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:34,970
insanely close matchup. That is closer than I
thought it was going to be. Actually, given the

555
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:41,010
stat discrepancies, I would have figured that the
cabal would have come out more wins ahead. I guess

556
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:45,970
that means that in the simulations, the team
didn't perform as well as they probably should

557
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:51,470
have. I'm not going to lie. After we entered all of
the stats, I thought the cabal was going to do a lot

558
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:56,450
better. I'm not sure what happened there. There
may have been some luck in your favor with that. Not

559
00:56:56,450 --> 00:57:01,750
enough to win though, but I got close. I got real
close, and that's all that matters. It's not who

560
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:08,310
wins. It's just about having fun. I did have fun
winning. Yeah, you're right. Did you have fun

561
00:57:08,310 --> 00:57:13,770
losing? I mean, not really. You just said it's
about having fun. Whatever. Great job, Marvel

562
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:18,530
fans. You did it again. Like I said, we're winning
the whole month of November. This is just the

563
00:57:18,530 --> 00:57:56,310
start. AG9K, help close us out. In our next
episode, we are doing another duel, this time

564
00:57:56,310 --> 00:58:03,350
pitting the cowboy, Jonah Hex against the zombie
cyborg, Deathlock. We want to give a big thanks to

565
