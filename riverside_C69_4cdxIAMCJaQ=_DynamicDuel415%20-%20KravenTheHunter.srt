15
00:01:31,918 --> 00:01:35,800
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

16
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,683
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based

17
00:01:40,723 --> 00:01:47,048
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother Johnny DC. And in this episode,

18
00:01:47,448 --> 00:01:52,732
we are going to be reviewing the latest Sony
Spider-Man Universe film, Kraven the Hunter.

19
00:01:53,192 --> 00:01:56,274
Jonathan liked the movie. I'm just gonna let
you guys all know you should make fun of him.

20
00:01:56,374 --> 00:02:01,297
He told me that he liked it. I was surprised.
I said it wasn't bad. I think it was the best.

21
00:02:01,734 --> 00:02:08,599
of the three Sony Spider-Man Universe films
that were released this year. Oh, you're wrong.

22
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:13,323
I would consider you incorrect in that assertion,
but we'll talk about it later and make fun

23
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:18,307
of you some more. Before we get into that review,
we're gonna break down the latest comic book

24
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:23,051
movie news to come out this past week, including
the news that Chris Evans has been confirmed

25
00:02:23,331 --> 00:02:28,695
by trades to return for Avengers Doomsday. So
in addition to Robert Downey Jr., we're gonna

26
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:32,914
have Captain America back, or maybe, you know,
He's playing some other fucking character,

27
00:02:32,934 --> 00:02:39,198
who knows? Baron Zemo. Bite your tongue. We
also learned that Clayface is going to get

28
00:02:39,238 --> 00:02:45,221
a film that is set for release on September
11th, 2026. And we also got a trailer for Harley

29
00:02:45,261 --> 00:02:50,304
Quinn Season Five. As always, we list our segment
times in our episode description. So feel free

44

48
00:04:25,122 --> 00:04:31,747
Though in yesterday's episode, they reviewed
Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and 2, with myself guesting

54
00:04:56,272 --> 00:05:02,637
But with that out of the way, quick to the NO
Prize! A NO Prize is an award Marvel used to

55
00:05:02,657 --> 00:05:07,841
give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel
NO Prize, is a digital award that we post on

56
00:05:07,921 --> 00:05:12,845
Instagram for the person that we feel gave the
best answer to our question of the week. Last

57
00:05:12,885 --> 00:05:17,929
week we asked you guys, what live action Marvel
or DC film do you think had the best cinematography?

58
00:05:18,494 --> 00:05:22,256
and what was your favorite shot? And this was
coming off the news we received that Rob Hardy

59
00:05:22,276 --> 00:05:27,500
was confirmed as the director of photography
for Supergirl Woman of Tomorrow. We didn't

60
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,043
get a whole lot of answers for this question,
but let's go ahead and break down our two honorable

61
00:05:31,063 --> 00:05:36,486
mentions as well as the no prize winner. Our
first honorable mention goes to Cyrus Moore,

62
00:05:36,787 --> 00:05:44,612
who said, Hey guys, Cyrus Moore here. We got
to go with Dion Beebe's greatest movie ever,

63
00:05:44,672 --> 00:05:50,755
greatest cinematography. movie, greatest CGI
movie, gotta go with the Green Lantern movie.

64
00:05:51,355 --> 00:06:01,400
The most beautiful scene was Parallax. Oh, such
a very powerful scene, so beautiful, couldn't

65
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,042
ask for a better movie. Yay. Now, I don't know
about you, Jonathan, but I am detecting an

66
00:06:07,162 --> 00:06:13,544
undercurrent of sarcasm in Cyrus Moore's answer,
and I think it largely has to do with how the

67
00:06:13,564 --> 00:06:19,450
appearance of Parallax on the screen. seemed
to flood the entire shot with the appearance

68
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:25,332
of diarrhea. I mean, it's either that Cyrus
Moore really likes Green Lantern cinematographer

69
00:06:25,412 --> 00:06:33,295
Diane Beebe, or he likes watching the toilet
flush after he goes to the bathroom. It's one

70
00:06:33,315 --> 00:06:38,736
of those two. Parallax aside, I don't think
Green Lantern had horrible cinematography,

71
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:44,471
right? Like the space scenes were pretty cool.
I mean, the CG was. pretty bad in retrospect,

72
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:49,254
but the rest of the movie didn't look bad. The
most memorable scene to me in the movie was

73
00:06:49,314 --> 00:06:54,318
when he flies on Owo for the first time. That
was a cool shot. Are you being sarcastic too?

74
00:06:54,558 --> 00:07:01,723
I don't even know anymore. Our next honorable
mention goes to Daniel Alonso, who said, Okay,

75
00:07:01,783 --> 00:07:07,347
favorite cinematography for Marvel's has to
be Black Panther. I think they just used so

76
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:13,007
many beautiful colors. It's such a wonderful
film to watch. I mean, the shots are just fantastic.

77
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:16,470
Like when Killmonger is taking the throne for
the first time, when they're first entering

78
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:22,995
Wakanda, the way they use the sun, it is just
magnificent. How his suit is integrated in

79
00:07:23,055 --> 00:07:28,620
every shot it's in. But my favorite is that
the one hour and five second mark when they're

80
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,183
entering Wakanda, it just looks like a post.
It looks like he got cut off a little bit there,

81
00:07:33,223 --> 00:07:37,278
but he was gonna say how the shot looked like
a postcard. And I went and I checked out the

82
00:07:37,478 --> 00:07:42,300
one hour and five second mark in the Black Panther
movie and he's right. It looks like a postcard

83
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:48,023
for Wakanda. The scene is beautifully lit with
the sun perfectly silhouetting the mountainscapes

84
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:52,885
of the Wakandan terrain. It was gorgeous. Ryan
Coogler really did a good job of having his

85
00:07:52,925 --> 00:07:58,547
director of photography differentiate between
the jungles of Wakanda and the cityscape of

86
00:07:58,607 --> 00:08:04,249
South Korea. In particular, my favorite shot
from that movie was actually the Jabari throne

87
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:09,403
room. when we see M'Baku sitting on his throne
up in the mountain peaks of the Mountain Tribes

88
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:14,326
Village. It was a beautiful night shot. It just
looked incredible. The waterfall scene, that

89
00:08:14,346 --> 00:08:18,787
was really well shot. So much of that movie
looked just so good. I would actually say that

90
00:08:18,847 --> 00:08:24,250
I liked the cinematography of Black Panther
2 Wakanda Forever more than I did the first

91
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:28,291
Black Panther. There's just something about
the palette with the added turquoise colors

92
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:33,413
from Namor's tribe. Talokhan? Yeah. Especially
like when they're fighting at night and stuff.

93
00:08:33,706 --> 00:08:37,467
I thought that looked really cool. Yeah, the
cinematography of both those films was pretty

94
00:08:37,507 --> 00:08:42,468
on point, especially for a library of films
within Marvel Studios that aren't really known

95
00:08:42,528 --> 00:08:47,589
for their cinematography. I'll still contend
that the best Marvel Studios cinematography

96
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:53,091
was in the Eternals film, or the first Guardians,
one of those two. Yeah, same. But the winner

97
00:08:53,131 --> 00:09:00,273
of this week's No Prize is Scott Camacho, who
said... Of course, I'm gonna go with Zack Snyder's

98
00:09:00,413 --> 00:09:07,165
Justice League with how the... character designs
and the filter and every time the scenery change

99
00:09:07,385 --> 00:09:14,029
between each character. My favorite shot will
be when the group is going to fight Superman

100
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:20,014
and you have the flash running in his speed
and then you see Superman's eyes trained on

101
00:09:20,054 --> 00:09:26,178
him and you get that oh shit moment. That is
by far my best shot. Yeah, say what you want

102
00:09:26,218 --> 00:09:32,614
about Zack Snyder in terms of his story decisions,
but it's hard to deny the fact. that his movies

103
00:09:32,874 --> 00:09:38,538
are like paintings. They look incredible. Yeah,
you think about Watchmen, you think about 300,

104
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:44,882
of course, really well known for its cinematography.
Even BBS had really good cinematography. Zach

105
00:09:44,902 --> 00:09:50,326
Snyder is probably a better cinematographer
than a director, or at least how he directs

106
00:09:50,406 --> 00:09:56,630
cinematographers. The blacks are on point, the
way he lights his scenes are very moody. Everything

107
00:09:56,691 --> 00:10:01,786
looks just really good. And he can really easily
differentiate between settings like the nightmare

108
00:10:01,826 --> 00:10:06,907
scene like underwater Atlantis, stuff like that.
It all looks fantastic. And if you need any

109
00:10:06,987 --> 00:10:12,449
proof of that, just look at the Joss Whedon
directed cut of Justice League and compare

110
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:18,470
it to Zack Snyder's version. The cinematography
is like night and day and Zack Snyder's shots

111
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:25,092
are so much better than what Joss Whedon did.
Yeah, definitely more epic for sure. So great

112
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:29,233
answer, Scotty. You win this week's No Prize.
If you the listener want a shot at winning

113
00:10:29,273 --> 00:10:34,198
your own No Prize. Stay tuned to later on in
this episode when we'll be asking another Question

114
00:10:34,238 --> 00:10:37,308
of the Week. But now that that's done, on to
the news!

115
00:10:42,822 --> 00:10:46,723
Alright, in a tiny bit of surprising news we
got this past week, we learned that Chris Evans

116
00:10:47,183 --> 00:10:52,264
will be returning for Avengers Doomsday, and
that was confirmed by the wrap. Actually, we

117
00:10:52,284 --> 00:10:55,925
got confirmation that a whole lot of actors
will be returning for Avengers Doomsday, but

118
00:10:55,985 --> 00:11:01,527
I think Chris Evans is probably the only newsworthy
one, because I figured that a lot of cast members

119
00:11:01,547 --> 00:11:06,888
would be returning for that film, except for
Chris Evans, who seemingly retired from the

120
00:11:06,908 --> 00:11:11,269
role at the end of Avengers Endgame, in the
same way like Robert Downey Jr. did, and Scarlett

121
00:11:11,309 --> 00:11:15,168
Johansson, and stuff like that. So it'll be
interesting how they bring Evans back for the

122
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:21,073
role. Of course, the movie deals with the multiverse,
allegedly, so they could be bringing back a

123
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:25,536
multiversal Chris Evans, kind of like how they
did in Deadpool and Wolverine, where he reprised

124
00:11:25,576 --> 00:11:30,320
his role as the Human Torch. Or it could be
an entirely new take on Captain America and

125
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,204
Steve Rogers. Yeah, of all the cast members
returning, I agree that Chris Evans and Robert

126
00:11:35,224 --> 00:11:40,489
Downey Jr. are definitely the most surprising
because it definitely felt like when they left

127
00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:45,633
their roles... they left them on a really, really
high note. Like their arcs were completely

128
00:11:45,693 --> 00:11:51,197
finished. So for them to return is, yeah, the
most shocking bit of news to come out of all

129
00:11:51,217 --> 00:11:56,660
of the cast members who are returning, including
like Haley Atwell, possibly Scarlett Johansson.

130
00:11:56,761 --> 00:12:00,723
I'm sure a few others will be returning as well.
Yeah, of course we know that Robert Downey

131
00:12:00,743 --> 00:12:06,788
Jr. is coming back as the character of Victor
Von Doom, AKA Dr. Doom. He's gonna be a multiversal

132
00:12:06,908 --> 00:12:12,304
variant of Dr. Doom. And one of the- best theories
that I found circulating online, actually I

133
00:12:12,344 --> 00:12:17,889
didn't find it. One of our listeners, Travis
Herndon, sent me this rumor that all the original

134
00:12:17,929 --> 00:12:22,873
Avengers cast are coming back as evil versions
of their characters. So like, we have infamous

135
00:12:22,993 --> 00:12:27,637
Iron Man with Robert Dunny Jr. We could be getting
Hydra Cap from the Secret Empire storyline

136
00:12:27,777 --> 00:12:32,341
with Chris Evans, Maestro with the Hulk, evil
versions of all the rest of the characters.

137
00:12:32,361 --> 00:12:39,734
And I think that rumor is the best one I've
heard in... how it makes me accept the casting

138
00:12:39,774 --> 00:12:45,397
of Robert Downey Jr. as Victor Von Doom a little
bit more. Because as listeners to this podcast

139
00:12:45,437 --> 00:12:49,979
will know, I fucking hate the idea of Robert
Downey Jr. playing Victor Von Doom. I want

140
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:53,840
the original Doom. I don't want some kind of
multiversal riff on Victor Von Doom. I think

141
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:58,642
Victor Von Doom is a good enough villain to
deserve his own unique casting. And it was

142
00:12:58,682 --> 00:13:04,465
really exciting to speculate on who that could
have been prior to our DJ's return. But nevertheless,

143
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:09,562
if he is coming back as the character, It would
be nice to have multiple iterations of that

144
00:13:09,602 --> 00:13:16,064
to help kind of solidify that concept of the
evil dark multiversal Avengers fighting against

145
00:13:16,404 --> 00:13:20,906
Earth's heroes. Yeah, it almost seems like they're
setting up something like the crime syndicate

146
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:27,628
or maybe even a better comparison would be like
the dark multiverse. Like because of King's

147
00:13:27,868 --> 00:13:34,326
actions or Loki's actions or whoever the fuck's
actions with the multiverse, there is a group

148
00:13:34,506 --> 00:13:39,870
of evil versions of the Avengers out there in
the multiverse that come and attack our universe,

149
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,914
possibly. Yeah, that sounds pretty exciting
to me. And I would definitely watch that. It

150
00:13:43,954 --> 00:13:48,878
sounds like Marvel ripping off DC is what it
sounds like. So yeah, it does sound exciting.

151
00:13:48,898 --> 00:13:52,181
Because it's DC's idea. Because the Dark Avengers
are definitely a thing within Marvel comics,

152
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:57,705
okay? So maybe just shut the fuck up. Yeah,
but not in this way, not in like this dark

153
00:13:57,765 --> 00:14:03,806
multiverse way. Well, maybe if DC would get
its fucking act together. instead of rebooting

154
00:14:03,866 --> 00:14:08,409
every five years and coming out with another
new iteration for Superman, you guys would

155
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:13,333
have your shit together long enough to do something
like this. Maybe if Marvel was good, Kevin

156
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:19,137
Feige could steal ideas from his own comics
instead of the DC comics. Maybe if DC comics

157
00:14:19,177 --> 00:14:24,000
were good, the characters would be more successful
in their translation to film. Maybe I will

158
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:30,684
beat your ass next time I see you on the street.
And maybe I'll be waiting for you. Good, good.

159
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:35,445
Throw it down. It'll be fun. This Chris Evans
news is really exciting guys. Avengers Doomsday

160
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:40,972
is slated for release on May 1st, 2026. And
this news brings us to our question of the

161
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:41,172
week.

162
00:14:45,658 --> 00:14:51,079
If Avengers Doomsday is featuring an evil version
of Earth's Mightiest Heroes, what evil version

163
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:57,181
of a character do you most hope to see and why?
Besides, you know, infamous Iron Man slash

164
00:14:57,221 --> 00:15:01,502
Doctor Doom or whatever they're doing there.

169
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:27,346
before December 21st. In DC news, DC Studios
confirmed this past week that a standalone

170
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:34,508
Clayface movie is being written by Mike Flanagan,
a filmmaker who wrote, directed, and edited

171
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:39,526
Dr. Sleep, which was the sequel to Stanley Kubrick's
The Shining. He has a background in horror,

172
00:15:39,726 --> 00:15:45,067
he's even working on an upcoming Exorcist reboot.
And I remember when we were reviewing Batman

173
00:15:45,107 --> 00:15:50,429
the Kip Crusader animated series, we talked
about how good the interpretation of Clayface

174
00:15:50,469 --> 00:15:55,911
was, and how cool it would be to see that version
in live action. Well, it looks like we're getting

175
00:15:56,211 --> 00:16:02,592
a version of Clayface, a horror version, on
the big screen, which is wild. I always wanted

176
00:16:02,632 --> 00:16:09,084
to see a horror version of Clayface on the big
screen. Ideally in a Batman movie, but I don't

177
00:16:09,104 --> 00:16:15,168
mind a standalone movie either. No, I think
if Kraven the Hunter and Morbius and fucking

178
00:16:15,229 --> 00:16:20,373
Joker, Folly, I do have taught us anything is
that these characters are better served as

179
00:16:20,493 --> 00:16:25,877
villains in movies starring the heroes. I don't
want to see Clayface in his own standalone

180
00:16:25,897 --> 00:16:30,020
film because when the movie's done, I'm just
going to be like, okay, so then when is this

181
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,552
character going to meet Batman? What I want
to see is them incorporate this version of

182
00:16:34,612 --> 00:16:39,796
Clayface into a Batman film. What it seems like
Warner Brothers is starting to do is pull a

183
00:16:39,837 --> 00:16:44,360
Sony. And they don't want to do that. I don't
know. So you're bringing up things like Morbius

184
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:49,525
and Kraven and Joker Folio do, forgetting the
fact that the first Joker movie was not bad.

185
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:54,649
The Penguin television series was really good.
I think they could do Clayface really well.

186
00:16:54,909 --> 00:16:59,253
And I think if they wanted to spin that into
Matt Reeves' Batman Universe, they absolutely

187
00:16:59,293 --> 00:17:02,910
could. Don't make excuses for them. You know
what would have made the first Joker movie

188
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:07,932
even better? If we got to see that version of
the Joker go up against Batman. Uh, maybe?

189
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:12,053
I mean, Bruce Wayne was in the movie. It was,
you know, kind of Bruce Wayne's origin story

190
00:17:12,093 --> 00:17:16,534
as well at the very end. I'm not saying I only
want to see villains in their own standalone

191
00:17:16,554 --> 00:17:21,835
films. I'm saying there are villains interesting
enough that could have their own standalone

192
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:28,217
projects, like TV shows, like movies, and I
would be excited to see that. Clayface is one

193
00:17:28,237 --> 00:17:34,337
of those. does is confirm that we're not going
to be seeing Clayface anytime soon in either

194
00:17:34,497 --> 00:17:39,742
the Batman Brave and the Bold film or Matt Reeves
the Batman universe. Well at least we're seeing

195
00:17:39,782 --> 00:17:45,487
Clayface at all then because we could not have
this Clayface film and not see him period in

196
00:17:45,547 --> 00:17:50,090
any of those projects. Well maybe they should
just put Clayface in a fucking Batman film.

197
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:54,134
Think about that. Well maybe they will. If this
is good. If this is like a really good version

198
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:59,246
and people really like it they'll put him in
the next Batman movie. They won't. You don't

199
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:05,028
know. We're not going to see Kraven in a Spider-Man
film now anytime soon, which fucking sucks.

200
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:10,370
You want to see that version of Kraven in a
Spider-Man film? No, but I want to see a version

201
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:15,472
of Kraven in a Spider-Man film. Like I said,
they did a good job with the Penguin. I could

202
00:18:15,492 --> 00:18:20,814
totally see them putting this version of Clayface
in a Batman movie if it's good. Why not? You're

203
00:18:20,834 --> 00:18:27,637
an apologist is what you are. You're a pessimist.
Piece of shit is what you are. I'm not a pessimist.

204
00:18:27,697 --> 00:18:33,204
I'm a realist. But you don't know is the problem.
Like you're saying all these bad things are

205
00:18:33,224 --> 00:18:40,468
gonna happen. You don't know. I'm going by precedent.
Oh, precedent like the Penguin? Okay. The Penguin

206
00:18:40,508 --> 00:18:46,571
was in the fucking Batman movie. Yeah. I mean,
who's to say Clayface can't be? I do. Okay.

207
00:18:47,472 --> 00:18:52,334
It's not gonna happen. Head of DC Studios, James
Gunn. I didn't realize I was doing a podcast

208
00:18:52,354 --> 00:18:59,630
with you. Yeah. And I just have to say, fuck
you, buddy. Geez. No one likes you. Damn! I'm

209
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:04,472
glad I proved you wrong on Twitter. Aw. I mean,
Mike Flanagan, we don't know if he's gonna

210
00:19:04,512 --> 00:19:09,134
direct the movie yet. There may be a strong
chance that he will, considering he's directed

211
00:19:09,174 --> 00:19:14,036
films like Dr. Sleep. But, you know, he's met
with James Gunn and Peter Sefferin. I would

212
00:19:14,076 --> 00:19:18,858
not be surprised if his clay face, you know,
if not tied into the Matt Reeves universe,

213
00:19:19,238 --> 00:19:25,781
would be tied into James Gunn's universe, the
DCU. You poor, naive bastard. Hey, let me have

214
00:19:25,921 --> 00:19:31,754
hope, okay? Let me hope. The film even has a
release date they're this confident in it.

215
00:19:32,115 --> 00:19:38,497
It's coming out on September 11th, 2026. Which
means that we'll probably get like casting

216
00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:42,998
news within the next few months here. Which
is awesome. And actually it wasn't the only

217
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:49,640
DC project to get a release date. Dynamic Duo,
the puppet movie of the various Robins, is

218
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:56,954
coming out June 30th, 2028. Holy shit, man.
Yeah, it's gonna take them a long time to do

219
00:19:57,054 --> 00:20:01,937
that stop motion animation. At that point, why
bother? We're already gonna see Robin before

220
00:20:01,977 --> 00:20:06,799
that with Brave and the Bold, so... I don't
know, I don't know. DC fuckin' up. As usual.

221
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:11,581
Okay, so what, you're already saying that's
gonna be a bad movie? You don't know. I'm James

222
00:20:11,661 --> 00:20:16,243
Gunn! I know! I'm telling you, it's gonna be
bad, and then I'm fuckin' up. You're not my

223
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:21,585
real James Gunn! You're the one that said I
was! Well guess what? I lied! Good, I don't

224
00:20:21,605 --> 00:20:29,670
wanna be. I wanna be Kevin Feige. Why no In
other DC news we got the first official trailer

225
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:35,954
for Harley Quinn season 5 and it looks like
the girls are moving to metropolis because

226
00:20:36,274 --> 00:20:41,798
Apparently giant rats have overtaken Gotham
City and it's just a total crap hole Which

227
00:20:41,838 --> 00:20:46,341
is nice to get like that change of scenery because
they've been in Gotham City for four seasons

228
00:20:46,401 --> 00:20:50,905
now and I think going to a place where we could
see new characters, I guess a lot of Superman's

229
00:20:50,925 --> 00:20:56,004
characters is Kinda interesting, I think. Yeah,
for sure though. It looks like a lot of the

230
00:20:56,144 --> 00:21:01,607
Gotham gang are tagging along with them, including
Bane, King Shark, and Clayface. Oh, that's

231
00:21:01,627 --> 00:21:06,850
right, Clayface. Speaking of which, just to
tack this onto the last bit of news, Alan Tudyk

232
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:12,013
voices Clayface in the Harley Quinn show. He's
also voicing Clayface in the Creature Commandos

233
00:21:12,153 --> 00:21:17,836
show, which means he might be playing the live
action version of Clayface. That might be interesting.

234
00:21:18,216 --> 00:21:22,371
But yeah, he's back for season five of Harley
Quinn. It looks like the big bad this season

235
00:21:22,771 --> 00:21:27,676
is going to be Brainiac, who is coming with
the pet monkey this time, it looks like, which

236
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:32,800
is kind of funny. It looks like Harley is going
to have to save Metropolis from Brainiac. Meanwhile,

237
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:38,625
Poison Ivy is going to be tackling the green
or something. Maybe the Enchantress, maybe

238
00:21:38,846 --> 00:21:43,490
Lena Luthor. That's what it appears from this
trailer, at least. I wonder what kind of situation

239
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:47,673
they're going to put Superman in, in that he's
not able to respond to Brainiac's invasion.

240
00:21:48,126 --> 00:21:52,509
and Metropolis is left with Harley Quinn to
save it. Well, we do get to see Superman in

241
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:57,233
this trailer, but maybe the involvement of the
Enchantress and her magical abilities prevent

242
00:21:57,273 --> 00:22:02,758
him from doing anything. That's just a guess.
But speaking again of Alan Tudyk, he also voices

243
00:22:02,818 --> 00:22:07,622
the Joker. He does a fantastic job with it.
It looks like he's also in Metropolis. Who

244
00:22:07,642 --> 00:22:12,306
knows if he's still trying to be a good guy
or a bad guy or what in this new city, but

245
00:22:12,386 --> 00:22:16,089
we also get Los Lane. So I'm sure she's gonna
be joining the girl group to help save the

246
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:20,987
day. Speaking of girl group, it looks like we
get Goldilocks in this season coming off the

247
00:22:21,027 --> 00:22:26,408
continuity of Kite Man Hell Yeah Season 1. It
appears Bane has finally settled down with

248
00:22:26,448 --> 00:22:32,390
that dominatrix chick and they're raising Goldilocks
together. Yeah, they probably moved to Metropolis

249
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,351
because it's a better city to raise a kid than
Gotham City I'm guessing. But I can't wait

250
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:40,792
for that. We reviewed Kite Man Season 1 recently
on this show and it was pretty good. It was

251
00:22:40,812 --> 00:22:47,718
a good setup for this season of Harley Quinn,
which debuts real soon here on January on Max

252
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:50,009
and we will be reviewing it once the season
ends.

253
00:22:57,326 --> 00:23:00,572
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and move on

254
00:23:00,592 --> 00:23:06,885
to our main event, where we review the latest
Sony Spider-Man universe film, Kraven the Hunter.

255
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:26,931
Kraven the Hunter was directed by J.C. Chandor
and stars Aaron Taylor Johnson and Russell

256
00:23:26,991 --> 00:23:32,336
Crowe. The film is the latest in a series of
Spider-Man adjacent films produced by Sony,

257
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:38,022
which includes other films such as The Venom
Trilogy, Morbius, and Madame Web. The quality

258
00:23:38,262 --> 00:23:45,029
of Sony's Spider-Man Universe movies have ranged
from absolutely watchable to entirely pointless.

259
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:50,334
The big question in my mind was where would
Kraven the Hunter fall in that spectrum? Because

260
00:23:50,475 --> 00:23:55,960
I and most people I think didn't have high expectations
for this film just given Sony's track record.

261
00:23:56,201 --> 00:24:00,425
We knew it wouldn't be great. But if you haven't
seen the movie yet, first off here's a spoiler

262
00:24:00,445 --> 00:24:05,630
warning, but second off here's your answer regarding
its quality. I would say it falls squarely

263
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:11,194
in the middle of Sony's Spider-Man Universe
films. And I think if one had to rank all the

264
00:24:11,214 --> 00:24:15,976
movies, not including the MCU Spider-Man films
or the animated Spider-Verse films, I think

265
00:24:16,036 --> 00:24:21,077
most people would put Venom at the top of the
list and Madame Web at the bottom. And the

266
00:24:21,117 --> 00:24:26,619
Venom sequels, Morbius and Kraven the Hunter,
arranged in some fashion in the middle. Yeah,

267
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:32,281
I definitely liked it more than Morbius. I definitely
liked it more than Madame Web. I am not a big

268
00:24:32,521 --> 00:24:37,685
Venom guy. I didn't really care for the last
one too much, definitely didn't like the second

269
00:24:37,785 --> 00:24:42,228
one, and you liked the first one a lot more
than me. I would actually say I liked this

270
00:24:42,329 --> 00:24:47,653
Kraven movie as much as the first Venom movie.
Well, I think this review will basically be

271
00:24:47,673 --> 00:24:53,097
a breakdown in why you are wrong, and I bet
you by the end of this review, your list will

272
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:57,942
change. Well, I largely feel like I liked this
movie more than you did because the characters

273
00:24:58,002 --> 00:25:04,315
are more sacred to you than they are to me.
That's exactly it. Like before I even get into

274
00:25:04,355 --> 00:25:09,899
what the film is, I want to speak briefly on
what the film should have been as a fan of

275
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,523
the comic book character. Because the biggest
mistake Kraven the Hunter makes is that it

276
00:25:14,543 --> 00:25:20,207
fails to recognize who the character is and
his appeal as a Spider-Man villain from the

277
00:25:20,247 --> 00:25:24,711
comic books. You know, the guy that they have
up on the screen here, like he has the same

278
00:25:24,751 --> 00:25:28,974
powers as Kraven the Hunter and he has the look
and the name. But if the writers and director

279
00:25:29,034 --> 00:25:34,614
knew anything else about Kraven, the film wouldn't
have had one. the organized crime elements,

280
00:25:35,094 --> 00:25:42,297
two, the weird daddy drama, three, the vigilante
justice elements, and four, the rescue mission

281
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:47,900
that was the plot's primary conflict. And yeah,
people may say that Kraven did, for a time

282
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:52,722
in the comics, turn into a hunter of hunters
where he killed poachers and whatnot, but that's

283
00:25:52,762 --> 00:25:57,904
not what this origin film should have been.
Kraven's not like Morbius, who is a good guy

284
00:25:57,944 --> 00:26:02,767
beset by a terrible curse, and Kraven's not
like Venom. who is a corrupted symbiote who

285
00:26:02,807 --> 00:26:08,971
actually wants to be good. Kraven's an asshole
in the comic books. He's prideful, he's resentful.

286
00:26:09,371 --> 00:26:15,015
You know, the crux of the comic book character's
motivation is his anger at the loss of his

287
00:26:15,055 --> 00:26:19,679
family's nobility when they were forced to flee
Russia for America during the Soviet Revolution

288
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:25,983
when he was a child. You know, it was this disdain
that drove him to kill, traveling the globe,

289
00:26:26,063 --> 00:26:31,375
becoming the world's greatest hunter. This movie
should have been like a treasure hunt film

290
00:26:31,475 --> 00:26:36,178
in the vein of Indiana Jones or a national treasure
meets the most dangerous game. It should have

291
00:26:36,198 --> 00:26:41,501
been about a guy who grew bored with killing,
who sought the ultimate quarry, like a super

292
00:26:41,541 --> 00:26:45,384
powered mercenary from Russia called the Rhino
or something like that. You know, have him

293
00:26:45,584 --> 00:26:51,348
seek out, find the Rhino, get defeated, learn
a lesson in humility, recover, get powers,

294
00:26:51,848 --> 00:26:56,487
then win in a final showdown. you know, bagging
his ultimate prize, and then end his life because

295
00:26:56,507 --> 00:27:00,970
he had nothing else to live for, just like Kraven's
last hunt storyline from the comics. It could

296
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:07,174
have been poetic, it could have been complex,
but adventurous and still fun. Instead, we

297
00:27:07,214 --> 00:27:13,137
got whatever this story was, about a Russian
crime family heir turned animal-powered vigilante

298
00:27:13,177 --> 00:27:17,720
assassin with mystical lions in the mix, and
a science experiment gone wrong villain with

299
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:22,971
his superpowered catheter and IV bag. There
were so many times during the course of this

300
00:27:23,031 --> 00:27:28,713
film where I was like, what the fuck are they
doing? Of all the choices the movie could have

301
00:27:28,793 --> 00:27:34,916
made, why did they make those? It was just really
puzzling. Not going to lie, your most dangerous

302
00:27:34,976 --> 00:27:40,798
game concept is fantastic. Like, I kind of wish
you would have done that as like a bonus episode

303
00:27:40,858 --> 00:27:45,060
pitch for our patrons, which we tend to do sometimes.
Like when we feel like we have a really good

304
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:50,138
idea for a movie, we'll record it and then upload
it as a bonus episode. I think that storyline

305
00:27:50,158 --> 00:27:54,521
sounds fantastic. Well, I might still write
that story one day and maybe post it on our

306
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:58,424
Discord channel or something. But that's really
what the movie should have been. I don't know

307
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:03,888
what this was. In my research for this film,
I learned that the writers of Kraven the Hunter,

308
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:10,152
Art Markham and Matt Holloway, also wrote Punisher
Warzone, which didn't surprise me because I

309
00:28:10,172 --> 00:28:14,755
feel like both films were trying to evoke the
testosterone-fueled late 80s, early 90s action

310
00:28:14,795 --> 00:28:19,914
films. That's fascinating because I actually
thought... that this movie should have gone

311
00:28:19,934 --> 00:28:25,397
a little bit harder are on the action and been
more like Punisher Warzone. Because I feel

312
00:28:25,417 --> 00:28:29,398
like all the hardcore violence stuff we saw,
we already got from the trailers. From the

313
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:34,841
Red Band trailers, yeah. I'll say at least Punisher
Warzone got the characterization of Frank Castle

314
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:40,523
right. And at least Punisher Warzone used practical
effects like the best 80s and 90s action films

315
00:28:40,563 --> 00:28:45,625
did. I feel like I would have enjoyed or at
least respected Kraven the Hunter so much more.

316
00:28:46,214 --> 00:28:52,179
if he wasn't occasionally a CGI character bouncing
around like Gumby in some shots. And the Rhino

317
00:28:52,219 --> 00:28:56,082
special effects and like the animal special
effects, they were a lot more rough than they

318
00:28:56,102 --> 00:29:01,947
should have been for a film with this tone.
They just need to stop trying to do the Rhino

319
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:08,072
in live action because they can't get it right.
Yeah, for sure. Poor guy has not been done

320
00:29:08,092 --> 00:29:12,516
justice. Speaking of action though, I'll give
the film credit where credit is due. If you

321
00:29:12,616 --> 00:29:17,580
overlook the special effects, the film... does
have some really well shot action. You know,

322
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:22,244
the prison escape into the snow storm, the chase
through London, the forest attack on Rhino's

323
00:29:22,284 --> 00:29:27,928
men. Those are all fantastic action set pieces.
At its best, Kraven the Hunter evoked other

324
00:29:27,948 --> 00:29:32,812
great actioners like Predator, Extraction, or
even Captain America the Winter Soldier. For

325
00:29:32,853 --> 00:29:38,878
my money, this film had better action than any
other Sony Spider-Man universe film, and probably

326
00:29:38,918 --> 00:29:44,050
honestly the best practical action since Shang-Chi
and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Yeah. And

327
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:48,773
therefore I can see why casual viewers who don't
know or care about the source material would

328
00:29:48,873 --> 00:29:54,897
probably like this film more than me and rate
it higher. To me, this film reminded me somewhat

329
00:29:55,018 --> 00:30:01,022
of like a Captain America film just in terms
of his like super soldier-esque power set or

330
00:30:01,062 --> 00:30:06,366
maybe like Black Panther with the car chase.
Yeah. In that sense, it felt a little redundant

331
00:30:06,406 --> 00:30:10,528
to me. Like I don't feel like I saw anything
even action wise that I hadn't already seen

332
00:30:10,568 --> 00:30:15,751
before. That said, It's still pretty cool to
see. Yeah, I mean, well, like Kraven the Hunter

333
00:30:15,771 --> 00:30:18,992
doesn't have the most original power set in
the comic books either. What really makes him

334
00:30:19,092 --> 00:30:24,493
unique was the driving force behind his actions
in trying to prove himself as a hunter, which

335
00:30:24,613 --> 00:30:29,555
this movie got none of that. None of that. In
addition to the action, though, another thing

336
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:33,836
that this film does well is that even though
they totally got the characters wrong from

337
00:30:33,876 --> 00:30:40,339
the comics, whether it's Kraven Rhino or Nikolai
Kravinov. At least they took the time to develop

338
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:44,660
the characters because their motivations were
pretty well established. Some might even say

339
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,562
that they spent too much time reiterating certain
character beats, but I think the payoffs in

340
00:30:49,583 --> 00:30:55,025
the end were all well earned from Nikolai's
death to Chameleon's betrayal. Yeah, maybe

341
00:30:55,045 --> 00:31:00,027
not so much with Calypso. I mean, we did get
a brief bit with her when she was a child,

342
00:31:00,167 --> 00:31:04,809
but you know, learning how she became so good
with the bow and stuff like that, it was like,

343
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:08,963
okay, sure, off screen stuff. It's fine. Yeah.
Oh, for sure. Actually, since we're talking

344
00:31:08,983 --> 00:31:12,927
about the characters, let's get into our character
breakdown. First, let's talk about Kraven the

345
00:31:12,947 --> 00:31:18,951
Hunter, aka Sergei Kravenov, played by Aaron
Taylor Johnson. As I've said before, I don't

346
00:31:18,971 --> 00:31:22,554
really recognize this characterization of Kraven
from the comic books, but I'll say that Aaron

347
00:31:22,574 --> 00:31:27,899
Taylor Johnson really owned the character as
portrayed here. Like, the dude exuded strength

348
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:33,983
and intrigue and charisma, and his acting...
is completely transformative when you look

349
00:31:34,024 --> 00:31:39,869
at his other comic book performances like Quicksilver
or Kick-Ass. There's no doubt in my mind that

350
00:31:39,889 --> 00:31:45,433
this guy is a star, despite the fact that he
seems unable to draw a box office as a lead.

351
00:31:45,513 --> 00:31:51,559
I think what he really requires is a franchise
like 007 James Bond to catapult him beyond

352
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:57,043
his current career status, and I hope at the
very least Kraven the Hunter serves as a vehicle

353
00:31:57,063 --> 00:32:01,411
to show his capabilities as a physical action
star. because I am rooting for him to be the

354
00:32:01,451 --> 00:32:05,894
next James Bond. Really? I was kind of hoping
for Henry Cavill. I mean, he could do it too,

355
00:32:06,454 --> 00:32:11,698
but I think Aaron Taylor Johnson is more interesting
than Henry Cavill, who's a little bit generic,

356
00:32:11,718 --> 00:32:17,543
I would say. Wow, okay. No, yeah, I've been
a fan of Aaron Taylor Johnson since his kick-ass

357
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:22,186
days. I don't remember seeing him in anything
prior to that, but yeah, he's always killed

358
00:32:22,507 --> 00:32:27,250
anything he's been in, whether it's this, whether
it's something like bullet train. which he

359
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:32,574
was phenomenal in terms of action. He's definitely
a star, yeah, I agree. In terms of Kraven's

360
00:32:32,614 --> 00:32:37,617
character arc, he grew up highly resentful of
his father and he spent the whole film trying

361
00:32:37,658 --> 00:32:43,482
to take down men like him and protect innocent
victims like wildlife or his brother, Dimitri.

362
00:32:43,942 --> 00:32:49,966
The irony and tragedy is that in trying to denounce
his father, Kraven became the exact man his

363
00:32:50,006 --> 00:32:54,922
father wanted him to be. He played right into
Nikolai's hands, taking out the Rhino. And

364
00:32:54,962 --> 00:32:59,946
for all his assertion that he was a good guy,
he failed to be there for his brother Dimitri,

365
00:33:00,146 --> 00:33:05,051
abandoning him, only to later be surprised by
his brother's hunger for power. The lesson

366
00:33:05,071 --> 00:33:10,095
that he needed to learn was that with great
power must come a lack of apathy. You know,

367
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:16,281
with great power must come not being a total
dick. But really, he didn't learn that until

368
00:33:16,321 --> 00:33:20,825
the last minute of the movie, because he was
mostly static for much of the runtime after

369
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:24,448
the first act. Yeah, he learned this lesson
at the end of the film, but we're not going

370
00:33:24,468 --> 00:33:28,611
to see the consequences of that. We're not going
to get to see him grow from that because I

371
00:33:28,651 --> 00:33:33,435
really doubt they're going to make a sequel
to this movie. Oh, no, this movie is bombing

372
00:33:33,475 --> 00:33:38,339
at the box office, which is no surprise. It
got the worst cinema score of any Sony Spider-Man

373
00:33:38,379 --> 00:33:45,025
universe film, including Madame Web. It's probably
going to be one of Sony's biggest flops and

374
00:33:45,225 --> 00:33:51,402
will likely result in either a reboot on Sony's
behalf or maybe hopefully. Is it too much to

375
00:33:51,422 --> 00:33:57,563
wish for them to sell the rights to Spider-Man
back to Marvel? Who knows? We'll see. But yet,

376
00:33:57,603 --> 00:34:02,405
to your point, this movie set up a lot of stuff
in its final moments for an upcoming sequel

377
00:34:02,445 --> 00:34:06,546
that will most certainly never happen. And it's
not the only film that's done that. You take

378
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:12,147
a look at Morbius. It's like, what is happening
with that? Absolutely nothing. Sony really

379
00:34:12,187 --> 00:34:16,889
dropped the ball. They really just need to stop
making movies about Spider-Man characters that

380
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:21,458
no one cares about. People want to see these
movies with Spider-Man. And you could also

381
00:34:21,498 --> 00:34:25,321
make the same argument for films like Clayface,
like who wants to see a Clayface movie without

382
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:31,846
Batman? Not me. But then I'm still hoping that,
you know, that'll lead into something with

383
00:34:31,907 --> 00:34:36,911
Batman, because I don't want just a Clayface
movie where he never interacts with Batman.

384
00:34:37,131 --> 00:34:40,714
And it was the same for Kraven. That was the
point I was trying to make earlier, man. But

385
00:34:40,734 --> 00:34:46,498
yeah, see, I have hope with the Sony Spider-Man
stuff. I don't have hope because Sony owns

386
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:50,898
the rights to these Spider-Man characters. That's
the difference. Yeah, that's true. That's true,

387
00:34:50,918 --> 00:34:56,001
that's a big difference. Let's go ahead and
move on to Nikolai Kravinov, played by Russell

388
00:34:56,021 --> 00:35:01,265
Crowe. Now I don't know what the fuck has happened
to Russell Crowe in the last decade, but why

389
00:35:01,305 --> 00:35:06,328
else would he take on roles like this one and
Zeus from Thor, Love and Thunder? I just, I

390
00:35:06,348 --> 00:35:10,811
didn't like his performance here. It seemed
ham-fisted and more like a caricature of a

391
00:35:10,872 --> 00:35:16,495
Russian mobster. But you know, even worse than
that, Nikolai was nothing like this in the

392
00:35:16,535 --> 00:35:21,459
comic books. He wasn't a drug runner. There
was no Kravinov. crime family. They just made

393
00:35:21,499 --> 00:35:25,702
him a mobster in the movie. It's like they took
notes from an entirely different script or

394
00:35:25,742 --> 00:35:31,706
something. And to have such an original character
have such bearing on an actually well-known

395
00:35:31,766 --> 00:35:37,350
established character I think is bizarre. It's
like inventing a cousin Archie for Peter Parker

396
00:35:37,751 --> 00:35:42,454
who was the primary influence for him becoming
a web-slinging hero, you know? It's just weird.

397
00:35:42,494 --> 00:35:46,477
I didn't like it. Yeah, I wonder if they were
trying to like squeeze the kink pen into this

398
00:35:46,517 --> 00:35:53,154
movie. Then at the last minute they're like,
uh, just, just make it his father. The Kraven

399
00:35:53,354 --> 00:35:57,717
story should not have anything to do with daddy
issues or a father. It should have just been

400
00:35:57,737 --> 00:36:02,160
the character, the father's an afterthought
in his story. It's ridiculous. But say you

401
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,783
didn't know the comic books. Say like you throw
all of that out the window. Is it still that

402
00:36:06,803 --> 00:36:12,307
bad? Um, no, it's not as bad if you don't know
the comic books. I'll say that, but I don't

403
00:36:12,327 --> 00:36:17,458
have that luxury. And so I'm just pissed off.
I'm crushed with this. Beautiful knowledge.

404
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:25,144
Let's go to move on to Chameleon, AKA Dmitri
Kravinov, played by Fred Hetchinger. This is

405
00:36:25,204 --> 00:36:29,326
my first time seeing Fred Hetchinger in anything.
I haven't seen the new Gladiator film yet.

406
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:34,210
So I'm not 100% sure what to think of his performance
because, you know, like the Chameleon has been

407
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:39,553
such a frankly Chameleon in the comic books
that his personality has never been quite consistent.

408
00:36:40,054 --> 00:36:44,757
I thought in the movie, Dmitri came across as
very meek and maybe too much of a damsel and

409
00:36:44,797 --> 00:36:49,000
distress. But in the comic books, Chameleon
has been everything from meek and mentally

410
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,944
unstable to cunning and a criminal genius. You
know, even his twist at the very end, you could

411
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:58,607
say that it came out of left field, but that
was still being keeping with the character

412
00:36:58,627 --> 00:37:03,631
from the comic books. I actually really like
what they did with the Chameleon here. I never

413
00:37:03,731 --> 00:37:10,236
thought he was an interesting Spider-Man villain,
but I cared for Demetri in this film, and the

414
00:37:10,296 --> 00:37:14,827
twist at the end was kind of heartbreaking.
It was. Yeah, like I said, I think those character

415
00:37:14,847 --> 00:37:19,689
payoffs at the end were well-learned. It was
interesting because Dimitri didn't really realize

416
00:37:19,709 --> 00:37:24,452
until the very end that Kraven was more like
his father than he realized, like a ruthless

417
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:29,694
killer. And likewise, Kraven, who always thought
that his brother Dimitri was innocent, learned

418
00:37:29,754 --> 00:37:35,157
that his brother actually did crave power and
would follow in his father's footsteps if given

419
00:37:35,177 --> 00:37:39,835
the chance. Yeah, as it turned out, some of
his father's influences, you know, pushing

420
00:37:39,875 --> 00:37:45,197
him to be strong and ambitious and stuff like
that actually did stick. I do like how that

421
00:37:45,217 --> 00:37:49,599
all played out. I do wish that instead of trying
to set up a sequel, that the filmmakers just

422
00:37:49,659 --> 00:37:55,141
made the chameleon the primary villain manipulating
events from the shadows, because as it was,

423
00:37:55,581 --> 00:37:59,803
I think the chameleon twists at the end was
just a little bit too late and a little bit

424
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:06,198
goofy, too, with the special effects. Oh, that
was fucking terrible. Holy cow. just like a

425
00:38:06,238 --> 00:38:12,220
really short, scrawny Aaron Taylor Johnson all
of a sudden. I was like, what? What? Stupid.

426
00:38:13,821 --> 00:38:18,643
Yeah, and then when he turned his face white,
so he has the look from the comic books that

427
00:38:18,683 --> 00:38:23,145
like blank white face, you know, that was kind
of ridiculous looking, a little bit too shiny

428
00:38:23,505 --> 00:38:27,067
in the special effects, a little bit too computer
animated. And then he went back to his normal

429
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:31,448
face. It was all bizarre. You know what I thought
they were going to do? And I actually got really

430
00:38:31,488 --> 00:38:36,775
excited when I was watching the movie, when
Kraven's father hands him the box saying, look

431
00:38:36,795 --> 00:38:42,118
what they did to my boy. I thought instead of
a finger, they were gonna hand him his nose.

432
00:38:42,598 --> 00:38:47,100
And I thought that was going to be like the
whole justification for the look of the chameleon.

433
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:51,463
Like they cut off his nose and shaved his head
and his eyebrows or something like that. Totally

434
00:38:51,503 --> 00:38:55,085
didn't go that route, but I thought it would
have been cool if they did. That would have

435
00:38:55,105 --> 00:38:59,107
been pretty severe if they did that. I'm kind
of glad they didn't, because I don't need like

436
00:38:59,147 --> 00:39:03,789
a ground to take on the chameleon, but I also
don't necessarily need a CGI faced chameleon.

437
00:39:04,198 --> 00:39:10,600
It should look practical, but you know, it should
be a mask. Okay, okay. I don't know if listeners

438
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,682
are too familiar with the chameleon as a Spider-Man
villain, but one of these days we'll get a

439
00:39:14,722 --> 00:39:19,204
duel episode in with him for sure. Maybe against
someone like Hard Target from DC. Let's go

440
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:26,507
ahead and move on to Rhino, aka Alexei Sitsovich,
played by Alessandro Nivola. Alessandro Nivola

441
00:39:26,547 --> 00:39:31,489
was probably a better actor than this movie
called for, but his personality for the Rhino

442
00:39:31,509 --> 00:39:35,939
was way off. And I think he was too smart to
be the same character from the comics. Like,

443
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:40,420
as you said earlier, they can't get the rhino
right on film, it seems like. Because previously

444
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,081
the character was played by Paul Giamatti. And
I think that brief look at him was actually

445
00:39:45,101 --> 00:39:49,723
a little bit more accurate personality wise,
but Giamatti's performance was horrible. And

446
00:39:49,743 --> 00:39:54,044
like the rhino suit was way off base in that
movie. Like they were really going for like

447
00:39:54,084 --> 00:39:59,638
the Transformers thing around that time. Right.
Yeah. But here. It's not really that much better

448
00:39:59,958 --> 00:40:05,082
at all. You know, it wasn't a suit. He was like
a rhino-human hybrid, and it was like a medical

449
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:10,525
condition given to Alexei by the Jackal in an
effort to increase his strength, which could

450
00:40:10,565 --> 00:40:16,229
be managed through an intravenous port in his
side. Okay, it was the Jackal. I was wondering

451
00:40:16,269 --> 00:40:21,973
who the scientist was. That is kind of cool.
Yeah, Miles Warren, that was the doctor that

452
00:40:21,993 --> 00:40:25,614
they referenced in the movie. And I thought
that was pretty cool because the Jackal has

453
00:40:25,654 --> 00:40:29,896
been hugely influential in Spider-Man's life
behind the scenes. In the comic books, you

454
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:35,639
know, Alexei was a hired thug who was dumb enough
to volunteer for KGB scientific experiments

455
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:40,441
with gamma radiation, which made him strong,
and then they gave him an indestructible suit.

456
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:46,724
And he was always kind of known for being dimwitted
and whatnot. Here they made him a rival crime

457
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:50,950
lord, which again, you know, probably works
better for people who don't. the comic books,

458
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:55,093
but I think a lot of comic book fans will just
be kind of puzzled by this portrayal of the

459
00:40:55,113 --> 00:40:59,816
character. Especially the whole Rhino-human
hybrid thing too. Yeah, you mentioned that

460
00:40:59,876 --> 00:41:06,080
Russell Crowe was like a caricature earlier.
I totally felt that way with this performance

461
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:11,884
for the Rhino. It felt just so artificial to
me. Well, to me, Nivola's performance as Alexi

462
00:41:11,904 --> 00:41:15,767
didn't seem like a caricature because it was
a little bit more subdued than Russell Crowe's

463
00:41:15,787 --> 00:41:20,346
performance, you know, who really went all in
on the scenery chewing. I didn't think that

464
00:41:20,386 --> 00:41:24,227
at all. I think the reverse of that. I thought
Russell Crowe's performance was subdued and

465
00:41:24,247 --> 00:41:29,129
kind of lazy and, you know, he was just kind
of cashing in a paycheck. But with this Alexi

466
00:41:29,149 --> 00:41:34,210
actor guy, I thought he made the most out of,
you know, the dog and just like grabbing the

467
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:40,192
counter like screaming silently and stuff. It
was just weird. That was really fucking weird.

468
00:41:42,373 --> 00:41:46,258
I didn't like his power set either. Like the
way they... portrayed it, how it was controlled

469
00:41:46,278 --> 00:41:50,479
with the IV pack that went into the port in
his side. It was so stupid, because it's like,

470
00:41:50,899 --> 00:41:55,941
he was trying to make a deal with those mobsters,
and he like, showed them his powers, they shot

471
00:41:55,981 --> 00:42:00,722
him, and he proved that he was invulnerable,
so they got all scared of him. But like, couldn't

472
00:42:00,742 --> 00:42:05,043
you just shoot him when he doesn't have the
fucking rhino skin? Or shoot him in the head,

473
00:42:05,303 --> 00:42:10,024
like before he fully transforms, because that
shit took forever. Exactly, it took a while

474
00:42:10,064 --> 00:42:14,718
for him to turn into the rhino, like 30 seconds,
you know? That's plenty of time. to kill the

475
00:42:14,758 --> 00:42:19,962
guy before he becomes a destructible. So weird.
Such a weird device. Let's go ahead and move

476
00:42:20,002 --> 00:42:25,427
on to Calypso Azili, played by Ariana DeBose.
I thought that was a solid casting choice.

477
00:42:25,547 --> 00:42:30,291
I thought Ariana brought pretty solid nuance
to an otherwise generic role. In the comics,

478
00:42:30,411 --> 00:42:35,516
Calypso is a voodoo priestess who loved Kraven
and gave him the potion to increase his longevity

479
00:42:35,556 --> 00:42:40,200
and physicality. But she was more manipulative
and villainous in the comics, not like the

480
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:44,590
goody two-shoes she is in this film. You know,
the movie did allude to some secrets about

481
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:49,712
her past, but it was done horribly. It was like,
oh, you just happened to have an extra healing

482
00:42:49,732 --> 00:42:54,494
potion on you despite saying you didn't. OK.
Oh, you're just secretly a badass with a crossbow,

483
00:42:54,514 --> 00:42:59,296
but you don't want to give us any hint as to
why. OK. All right. Sure. I feel like there

484
00:42:59,336 --> 00:43:05,019
was more to her character in the film that was
actually cut. And that was why they clearly

485
00:43:05,059 --> 00:43:10,281
had to ADR some line changes with her scenes
and stuff. Oh, my God. It's probably why even

486
00:43:10,301 --> 00:43:14,404
though she had clairvoyance as a kid. She didn't
have any of that stuff as an adult, unless

487
00:43:14,424 --> 00:43:19,689
you want to attribute the deus ex machina of
her killing the foreigner as a result of her

488
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:24,153
clairvoyance, which I think you almost have
to in order for that scene to not feel cheap.

489
00:43:24,514 --> 00:43:33,683
The ADR in this film and the CG mouth movement
was almost as bad as the Henry Cavill mustache

490
00:43:33,763 --> 00:43:38,762
in Justice League debacle. Yeah. Oh, for sure.
You know, they did a lot of weird ADR stuff

491
00:43:38,822 --> 00:43:44,685
with the dialogue in Madam Web as well, so it
makes me think that you have a solid case of

492
00:43:44,745 --> 00:43:49,307
studio interference just fucking shit up that
they have to kind of clean up and post with

493
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:54,569
some last minute dialogue changes. We'll probably
also get a Calypso duel somewhere down the

494
00:43:54,609 --> 00:43:59,431
line. I think one of our executive producers,
Devin Davis, suggested the idea of putting

495
00:43:59,451 --> 00:44:04,213
Calypso against Papa Midnight, who was in the
Constantine film, being that they're both voodoo.

496
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:09,153
practitioners and I thought that was a solid
idea. Yeah, totally. Let's go to move on to

497
00:44:09,253 --> 00:44:13,737
Foreigner, played by Christopher Abbott. Now,
Foreigner has no other name because that's

498
00:44:13,757 --> 00:44:19,702
all he's known as in the comic books. I've always
thought he's one of the lamest ass supervillains

499
00:44:19,742 --> 00:44:25,627
of all time. He was married to Silver Sable,
so he's an Eastern European mercenary. But

500
00:44:25,647 --> 00:44:32,153
I wanna ask you, Jonathan, what do you think
his power is? Was it like hypnosis via like

501
00:44:32,273 --> 00:44:38,658
eye contact? Yeah, okay, so you got it. I was
really taken back by how the movie portrayed

502
00:44:38,678 --> 00:44:44,083
his ability, but essentially he can put people
into a 10 second hypnotic trance, which makes

503
00:44:44,403 --> 00:44:49,447
people think that he has super speed. But here
it seemed like it was only a three second trance

504
00:44:49,627 --> 00:44:54,051
and they portrayed his movements almost as if
he did have super speed. It was really weird.

505
00:44:54,452 --> 00:45:00,357
Well, I think they wanted to give the audience
the same kind of perception as anyone who was

506
00:45:00,377 --> 00:45:05,251
hypnotized by him. I'm wondering why he had
to like count down the trance every time out

507
00:45:05,312 --> 00:45:09,974
loud. Like every single fucking time he used
his power. It was really bizarre. It's like

508
00:45:10,034 --> 00:45:13,796
one of those things, just like the rhino. It's
like, before he counts down to one, just shoot

509
00:45:13,816 --> 00:45:21,200
him in the head. It was always just like slow
motion bullet time. One, two, three. But they

510
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:25,943
did that like six or seven times in the movie.
I think it could have been pretty clear what

511
00:45:25,963 --> 00:45:30,165
was going on without the counting. Yeah, I agree.
What was your impression of the foreigner?

512
00:45:31,002 --> 00:45:36,124
I was just like, I wonder how this is a translation
from the comics, because this is kind of bizarre.

513
00:45:36,244 --> 00:45:40,606
I don't know anything about the foreigner, and
I'm kind of wondering why they decided to include

514
00:45:40,626 --> 00:45:47,129
him in a Kraven movie. Is he a Kraven villain,
or is he like a Spider-Man villain? He's a

515
00:45:47,209 --> 00:45:52,312
Spider-Man villain. He's very much tied into
the Silver Sable corner of the Spider-Man world,

516
00:45:52,592 --> 00:45:57,166
which is largely set in Eastern Europe. You
know, she's the leader of some Caria. I do

517
00:45:57,186 --> 00:46:00,708
think that they should have given Foreigner
an accent, not Russian necessarily, but some

518
00:46:00,728 --> 00:46:05,450
kind of like Eastern European accent. I think
that would have been more in keeping with the

519
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:09,392
character and would have helped sell his name
as the Foreigner a little bit better, you know?

520
00:46:09,932 --> 00:46:15,935
I take it they're not making the Silver Sable
movie anymore if he is dead now? A Silver Sable

521
00:46:15,955 --> 00:46:20,537
movie was rumored, but I don't believe it's
in any sort of active development with Sony.

522
00:46:21,014 --> 00:46:25,818
because the latest news from sources was that
Sony is kind of taking a break on the Spider-Man

523
00:46:25,938 --> 00:46:31,903
spin-off films. Holy shit, it's about time.
Yeah. It's like, fool me once with Morbius.

524
00:46:32,063 --> 00:46:38,348
Shame on you. Fool me twice with Madame Web.
Shame on me. Fool me three times with Kraven?

525
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:43,053
Fucking stop. You gotta go. You gotta go at
that point. Strike three, you're out. It's

526
00:46:43,073 --> 00:46:48,397
so surprising that Sony decided to release three
Spider-Man universe films in 2024. It's just

527
00:46:48,437 --> 00:46:52,924
crazy. You would think if the reason that they're
making these movies is just to hold on to the

528
00:46:52,964 --> 00:46:58,628
rights of Spider-Man, they would delay the release
of these films until like the very last minute.

529
00:46:59,088 --> 00:47:05,113
Right. Exactly. It's almost like they're trying
to get rid of the rights for Spider-Man. It's

530
00:47:05,153 --> 00:47:06,273
almost like they're dumb.

539
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:05,187
Let's go ahead and move into our story highlights.
Sergei Kravinov is transported to a Russian

540
00:48:05,227 --> 00:48:10,752
prison where, calling himself Kraven the Hunter,
he murders an imprisoned crime boss named Samin

541
00:48:10,792 --> 00:48:16,377
Chorni. He escapes the prison into the Russian
tundra where he flees via a chartered plane.

542
00:48:16,437 --> 00:48:20,681
I want to know who his pilot was, like they
were all mysterious with that, like it was

543
00:48:20,701 --> 00:48:25,485
going to be some big reveal or easter egg and
it just turned into a big ol' nothing burger.

544
00:48:25,770 --> 00:48:29,811
It was Madame Webb. I think Devin Davis, one
of our producers, speculated that it could

545
00:48:29,831 --> 00:48:34,052
have been Silver Sable, but I don't know about
that. It's one of those things where that had

546
00:48:34,072 --> 00:48:38,593
to have been revealed in an earlier cut of the
film. But when they were like shifting things

547
00:48:38,633 --> 00:48:42,734
around due to studio intervention, then yeah,
maybe it could have been Silver Sable. That's

548
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:48,256
as good a guess as any. I think the film started
off really promising with the prison escape

549
00:48:48,416 --> 00:48:53,417
action scene and him running into that big storm
cloud. I thought that was a pretty cool shot.

550
00:48:53,938 --> 00:48:58,300
One thing I didn't get is when he's like eyes
glowed at the wolf and the wolf was like, oh

551
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:03,683
shit, bro, sorry, then like ran away. They never
played up on that again. Well, they kind of

552
00:49:03,723 --> 00:49:08,666
insinuate that he has some kind of rapport with
animals. And when he's using his powers, his

553
00:49:08,806 --> 00:49:14,028
eyes turn into like a lion's eyes. He can't
speak with animals directly. You know, I don't

554
00:49:14,048 --> 00:49:20,172
think it's as clear cut as that, but he can
influence them in some way. So which is somewhat

555
00:49:20,212 --> 00:49:24,058
in keeping with the comic books, like he doesn't
have animal communication powers. but he can

556
00:49:24,118 --> 00:49:28,722
easily train animals and he does use a lot of
trained animals in his battles with Spider-Man.

557
00:49:29,042 --> 00:49:32,926
So then why the hell did that leopard attack
him at the end of the movie? I don't fucking

558
00:49:32,946 --> 00:49:36,909
know man, I think they were insinuating that
the leopard was playing with him, but I couldn't

559
00:49:36,989 --> 00:49:41,333
quite be sure. He did get the leopard to attack
Rhino's men at the end, so you never know.

560
00:49:41,753 --> 00:49:46,137
Did he? Yeah. Are that the leopard just did
that because they were in his territory? I

561
00:49:46,177 --> 00:49:50,861
don't think so, because they also look at the
water buffalo. Oh, okay. That's highly coincidental.

562
00:49:51,266 --> 00:49:57,090
for all those animals to be attacking these
guys. That's fair. In a flashback to 16 years

563
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:01,733
ago, a teenage Sergey and his brother Dmitri
are picked up from St. Michael's Academy in

564
00:50:01,773 --> 00:50:06,476
New York by their crime lord, Father Nikolai.
He informs the boys that their mother committed

565
00:50:06,516 --> 00:50:12,480
suicide and that in response, they're going
to hunt a lion named Tsar in Africa. In Ghana,

566
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:17,164
a young girl named Calypso learns from her grandmother
that she is descended from a line of voodoo

567
00:50:17,204 --> 00:50:21,670
priestesses and gives her a healing potion.
telling her that she would know when to use

568
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:25,933
it. This is when the film started getting bad
for me. I think with the weird plot choice

569
00:50:25,993 --> 00:50:30,695
of, you know, we'll go on a hunt instead of
going to a funeral and the scene with young

570
00:50:30,715 --> 00:50:37,319
Calypso and her grandmother was pretty cringe-worthy.
Yeah, the grandmother's voice was not the grandmother's

571
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:43,282
voice. That was some other actress, like 100%.
During the Kravinov's hunting expedition, Nikolai

572
00:50:43,302 --> 00:50:47,684
is approached by Alexei Sitsovich, who tries
to offer a business arrangement with him, but

573
00:50:47,724 --> 00:50:53,432
is rejected for his perceived weakness. Sergei
stumbles upon Tsar, but refuses to shoot him.

574
00:50:53,652 --> 00:50:58,775
However, Nikolai shoots the lion who attacks
and carries Sergei away. Calypso leaves a family

575
00:50:58,815 --> 00:51:04,139
safari trip and stumbles upon Sergei's wounded
body. She gives him the Voodoo Potion and alerts

576
00:51:04,199 --> 00:51:09,882
medical responders who take Sergei to a hospital
where he dies, but is revived by the potion,

577
00:51:09,902 --> 00:51:14,405
which gives him special powers. I wanna know
what the fuck this scene with the lion is all

578
00:51:14,445 --> 00:51:19,619
about. Like the way the lion acted, it made
it seem like Kraven was some kind of predestined

579
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:24,902
warrior chosen either by the Loa or by nature
itself or something like that. But we never

580
00:51:24,962 --> 00:51:31,064
learned for what purpose. Like it couldn't possibly
be that this lion just wanted all these crime

581
00:51:31,084 --> 00:51:36,427
bosses off the map, right? Something was faded
there and we have no reason why. He was the

582
00:51:36,487 --> 00:51:42,229
chosen one, Joseph. Okay, go on. He's a result
of thousands of years of ancient prophecy among

583
00:51:42,249 --> 00:51:48,852
the lion community. to carry on the mantle of
the lion. And do what? Fucking kill mobsters,

584
00:51:48,992 --> 00:51:56,055
I don't know. Exactly, who knows? I don't think
this movie would do well in a rewatch because

585
00:51:56,115 --> 00:52:01,377
as soon as you see the lion being gentle with
Kraven and whatnot, you're gonna be like, well,

586
00:52:01,457 --> 00:52:06,479
why though? We never learned why. I think what
they were going for was that Kraven was supposed

587
00:52:06,499 --> 00:52:12,761
to be some champion of nature, like defending
them against poachers and from man itself.

588
00:52:13,174 --> 00:52:18,076
But they didn't really follow through with that,
beyond the poaching thing. Yeah, there were

589
00:52:18,096 --> 00:52:22,077
a couple scenes where he went after poachers,
but that wasn't like his primary goal. Like,

590
00:52:22,758 --> 00:52:27,880
his primary goal was to go after men he perceived
as evil. Like, the guy in the Russian Gulag,

591
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:32,942
he wasn't a poacher, right? But he went through
all this effort just to kill the guy. No, he

592
00:52:32,962 --> 00:52:37,704
was a weapons dealer. Right, exactly. And his
father was a drug runner. You don't know how

593
00:52:37,784 --> 00:52:44,038
drugs affect the lion community, bro. Okay,
alright. That lion's parents were killed by

594
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:51,081
druggies one night. In Crime Alley? Crime-staring
Getty. The Kravinovs travel back to their home

595
00:52:51,101 --> 00:52:55,143
in London, where Sergei finds a note from his
mom stating that she couldn't bear Nikolai's

596
00:52:55,163 --> 00:53:00,685
abuse anymore. Nikolai chastises Sergei for
failing to shoot Tsar, revealing the lion's

597
00:53:00,725 --> 00:53:05,707
head mounted on his wall. Sergei runs away from
home, saying goodbye to his brother Dmitri,

598
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:10,549
and travels to his mother's family's old estate
in the Siberian forest, which she calls home.

599
00:53:10,966 --> 00:53:15,727
There he discovers a group of poachers taking
the horns of a group of wild buffalo and he

600
00:53:15,787 --> 00:53:20,890
kills them in anger What was your reaction to
seeing the lion head mounted on the wall? Cuz

601
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:24,871
I was shocked when I saw that I was like you
Bastards, that was a cool ass lion. That was

602
00:53:24,911 --> 00:53:30,774
a huge lion man. Yeah, that head was massive
I really don't like the idea of trophy hunting

603
00:53:30,814 --> 00:53:36,216
in general like you're not gonna eat lion meat,
right? So like why kill the fucking lion? The

604
00:53:36,276 --> 00:53:40,237
only reason I think you should kill a lion is
if it's self-defense if it's trying to kill

605
00:53:40,277 --> 00:53:45,245
you Otherwise, just leave the lion alone. Just
fucking leave the lion alone. That's what I'm

606
00:53:45,285 --> 00:53:51,189
saying. Back in the present day, Kraven returns
home from the Russian prison and kills another

607
00:53:51,229 --> 00:53:55,993
group of poachers near his home. He tracks their
leader to London where he reveals a list of

608
00:53:56,073 --> 00:54:00,916
names of crime bosses he intends to kill. He
meets with Calypso, now an attorney working

609
00:54:00,956 --> 00:54:05,880
out of London, and thanks her for saving him
all those years ago and asks for her help in

610
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:10,976
locating the names on his list. Now, was Alexi's
name on this list? I was kind of confused by

611
00:54:11,016 --> 00:54:16,579
that. Allegedly, allegedly, that's what Alexi
has led to believe. We never know for certain

612
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:21,583
whether that's true or not. I'm inclined to
believe that, yeah, Alexi's name was on that

613
00:54:21,623 --> 00:54:26,886
list. But the movie made a big mistake in not
actually showing that. That's ridiculous, because

614
00:54:26,926 --> 00:54:31,830
that was the whole motivation of the primary
antagonist. Exactly. You're not going to show

615
00:54:31,870 --> 00:54:37,153
that. What the hell was it all for then? I have
no idea. Alexi's henchmen, too. He was like,

616
00:54:37,406 --> 00:54:42,029
Yeah, you're probably on that list. I'm like,
you're gonna go through all this for a probably?

617
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:47,372
For real, it's like calm down. You may have
nothing to worry about. Meanwhile, Alexei Sisyvich,

618
00:54:47,452 --> 00:54:51,735
now a crime boss going by the name of Rhino,
learns of Kraven the Hunter from video footage

619
00:54:51,775 --> 00:54:56,558
of his Russian prison escape. Trying to allocate
power, he reveals to a group of mobsters that

620
00:54:56,598 --> 00:55:01,322
he can turn his skin as durable as a Rhino,
due to genetic experimentation. He and his

621
00:55:01,362 --> 00:55:06,265
men make a move against Nikolai Kravinov at
a lounge, which Dmitri owns, and performs that

622
00:55:06,365 --> 00:55:11,503
as a singer. When the attempt fails, Rhino hires
a mercenary called the foreigner who has the

623
00:55:11,543 --> 00:55:18,986
ability to put people into a temporary trance.
So it's weird because the Rhino wanted to partner

624
00:55:19,086 --> 00:55:25,629
with Nikolai. Yeah, 16 years ago. But it's like
if he's going after Nikolai, why is Nikolai

625
00:55:25,649 --> 00:55:30,891
sending him footage of his son? I have no idea
why. Yeah, it doesn't make sense at all, because

626
00:55:30,931 --> 00:55:33,972
it's like either they're working together or
they're working against each other, right?

627
00:55:34,473 --> 00:55:39,510
If they're working against each other, why?
is Nikolai helping Rhino out with the footage

628
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:45,292
of his son. You could say that he's just trying
to get his son onto the Rhino's trail because

629
00:55:45,332 --> 00:55:51,014
he knows that his son can kill the Rhino, but
if the Rhino knew that the video footage was

630
00:55:51,094 --> 00:55:56,596
from his sworn enemy, why would he trust it?
Why would he use it? It's all bizarre. Kraven

631
00:55:56,636 --> 00:56:00,777
visits his brother Dimitri for his birthday
and spends the night outside after a night

632
00:56:00,817 --> 00:56:04,860
of drinking. The next morning, Kraven finds
that his brother was kidnapped from his bed

633
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:09,764
and he pursues Rhino's men through the streets
of London. They escape his pursuit in a helicopter

634
00:56:10,124 --> 00:56:15,208
and Kraven asks Calypso for help finding them.
Calypso's source leads Kraven to a Turkish

635
00:56:15,308 --> 00:56:20,813
monastery, however Calypso's source is revealed
to be manipulated by the foreigner. I loved

636
00:56:20,873 --> 00:56:25,556
the London chase scene. I thought that was probably
the highlight action set piece of the film.

637
00:56:25,877 --> 00:56:30,218
It had loads of adrenaline. I like the parkour
elements, you know, and the helicopter escape

638
00:56:30,238 --> 00:56:35,880
thing was really well done. A lot of the action
in the movie was a lot cooler than I thought

639
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,061
it would be based on the trailers. Like I thought
it was gonna be kind of goofy with him like

640
00:56:40,101 --> 00:56:44,943
running on all fours in certain scenes and stuff
like that, but I thought it was edited really

641
00:56:45,003 --> 00:56:49,464
well. For sure. I remember from the trailers
I thought the action was gonna be real gimmicky

642
00:56:49,764 --> 00:56:54,905
with him using like bear traps to snap dude's
heads off and stuff like that. But no, I loved

643
00:56:54,945 --> 00:56:59,396
all that. trap stuff, which is a later scene,
but the action in general was just top notch.

644
00:56:59,796 --> 00:57:04,178
Speaking of action and set pieces, Kraven ambushes
Rhino's men in Turkey, but it turns out to

645
00:57:04,198 --> 00:57:08,961
be a trap and the monastery is blown up with
a rocket launcher. Rhino tells the kidnapped

646
00:57:09,001 --> 00:57:13,483
Dimitri that his brother is dead and offers
to partner with him against his father Nikolai's

647
00:57:13,543 --> 00:57:19,266
crime ring, but Dimitri refuses. Kraven survives
the trap and brings Calypso to his home in

648
00:57:19,326 --> 00:57:21,427
Serbia to protect her from Rhino's men.

649
00:57:25,334 --> 00:57:29,177
pieces of the monastery that were falling on
top of them. Yeah, what the hell was that about?

650
00:57:29,197 --> 00:57:33,421
They should have shown how he survived that.
You can't just do that on screen. You can't

651
00:57:33,441 --> 00:57:37,945
just cheat like that. Exactly. We see like the
pieces falling on top of him. The audience

652
00:57:37,985 --> 00:57:42,069
is fairly certain that this guy is buried in
this rubble, but like the next time you see

653
00:57:42,089 --> 00:57:48,615
the shot, he's just completely fine and outside
of it. When Kraven brought Calypso to his home

654
00:57:48,635 --> 00:57:53,927
in the Serbian forest and he's attacked by that
I thought her reaction to that whole event

655
00:57:54,048 --> 00:57:58,271
was really strange too. She just seems not shocked
by it at all. I don't know if you noticed that.

656
00:57:58,611 --> 00:58:02,755
She was like, I'll just let him die. It's fine.
Yeah. She like takes a step back and she's

657
00:58:02,795 --> 00:58:10,501
like, Oh, what? Okay. Preach of this, like she
really hadn't seen him do too much, right?

658
00:58:10,921 --> 00:58:16,546
Like, was she aware of his powers? Yeah. Well,
I think she knew that he was physically capable,

659
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:21,158
but I don't think she had seen him in action
yet by that point at Kraven's home. Kraven

660
00:58:21,218 --> 00:58:25,679
and Calypso discuss their next steps, but Rhino
finds them first thanks to a phone call from

661
00:58:25,719 --> 00:58:30,920
Dimitri and the foreigners' detective work into
the local flora. Kraven makes short work of

662
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:36,122
Rhino's men in the forest, but is tranquilized
and beaten by the foreigner. However, Calypso

663
00:58:36,182 --> 00:58:40,283
kills the foreigner with a bow and arrow before
the villain can deliver his kill shot, and

664
00:58:40,323 --> 00:58:46,645
she heals Kraven with another potion she had.
I did think it was cool that his fear was spiders,

665
00:58:46,785 --> 00:58:52,214
just as like a nod to Spider-Man. Yeah. I mean,
it doesn't- makes sense outside the context

666
00:58:52,234 --> 00:58:56,976
of Spider-Man, you know, otherwise, why is his
fear of spiders? They never really established

667
00:58:57,016 --> 00:59:01,438
that. It just seems kind of random. No, they
did because his mother was afraid of spiders.

668
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:06,501
Geez, I don't even remember that. Yeah, she
was like schizophrenic. She saw spiders on

669
00:59:06,521 --> 00:59:12,704
the walls. And so I think they kind of tied
his fear of spiders into her fear of spiders.

670
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:17,794
Maybe he was afraid that he was like her and
would also see spiders. Well that's pretty

671
00:59:17,814 --> 00:59:21,455
cool then. Too bad we'll never see Kraven go
up against Spider-Man or have that have any

672
00:59:21,495 --> 00:59:25,998
sort of payoff whatsoever. Maybe. I wouldn't
be surprised if they brought these guys back

673
00:59:26,018 --> 00:59:31,480
for Secret Wars. They won't. You never know.
That line with Calypso about how she's like,

674
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:35,402
you're not the only one with secrets was the
most throwaway line in cinematic history, I

675
00:59:35,422 --> 00:59:40,804
feel like. For sure. As Rhino escapes with Demetri
in an armored convoy, Kraven steers a herd

676
00:59:40,844 --> 00:59:46,319
of water buffalo to attack and flip his trucks.
Rhino transforms into his animal form and goes

677
00:59:46,379 --> 00:59:51,163
toe to toe with Kraven. Kraven impales Rhino
with a metal rod into his intravenous port

678
00:59:51,223 --> 00:59:56,026
on his side, killing him. With his dying breath,
Rhino reveals that he received the prison escape

679
00:59:56,066 --> 01:00:01,770
footage from Nikolai, whom Kraven learns used
him to take his enemies out. Kraven kills his

680
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:06,673
father in northern Russia using an enraged grizzly
bear. I mean, can you really say that he killed

681
01:00:06,713 --> 01:00:12,637
his father? I mean, he took the ammo away from
him, but it was kind of second-hand murder.

682
01:00:13,286 --> 01:00:18,910
I think he lured the grizzly bear to his father's
location. Okay. I wasn't clear about that.

683
01:00:19,351 --> 01:00:24,835
But I could see how you could make that argument.
He's sneaky in that way. You know, he has deniability

684
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:30,480
if it's a bear attack. But no, I totally think
he killed his father. I thought the way he

685
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:36,245
took the rhino out was a little bit cheap. Like
of course his port on his side would be a weak

686
01:00:36,285 --> 01:00:40,808
spot for Kraven to exploit because otherwise
Rhino was just wiping the floor with Kraven.

687
01:00:41,009 --> 01:00:47,251
It was his exhaust port. His Death Star Exhaust
port. Exactly, yeah. That whole device with

688
01:00:47,291 --> 01:00:50,652
the intravenous backpack and everything like
that, it was just all set up for this killing

689
01:00:50,692 --> 01:00:56,433
blow. And I thought it was too convenient. Oh,
100%. Yeah, absolutely. They should have had

690
01:00:56,453 --> 01:01:00,694
him go after his eyes or something like that,
you know? Like, the chameleon didn't need an

691
01:01:00,734 --> 01:01:05,536
intravenous port in order to transform his appearance.
Why couldn't the rhino just transform into

692
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:12,934
his rhino hybrid form without the IV drip? Because
the riders suck? Exactly, exactly. One year

693
01:01:12,974 --> 01:01:17,335
later, back in London, Kraven visits his brother
for his birthday and learns that Dimitri is

694
01:01:17,375 --> 01:01:22,056
taken over the Kravenov crime ring. Dimitri
reveals he visited the same doctor as Rhino

695
01:01:22,076 --> 01:01:26,957
in New York who gave him the ability to shape
shift and is now going by the chameleon. Dimitri

696
01:01:26,997 --> 01:01:32,039
tells Kraven that Nikolai left him a gift back
home where Kraven finds a vest made from Tsar

697
01:01:32,139 --> 01:01:36,580
the Lion. He puts it on and looks at himself
in the mirror. I want to know what the fuck

698
01:01:36,600 --> 01:01:40,921
kind of ending that was. Like I think they were
going for maybe like a contemplative Godfather

699
01:01:40,961 --> 01:01:47,786
2 type ending. but it kind of played out more
like a weird Calvin Klein ad. He's like, whoa,

700
01:01:48,046 --> 01:01:53,210
check out myself in the mirror sitting down
with my vest open. He like strikes a pose and

701
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:58,074
everything like that. Just a really weird way
to end a movie. Kind of plative about what?

702
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:02,517
That he was wearing a vest made of the lion
who attacked him when he was young? It's like,

703
01:02:02,598 --> 01:02:07,942
I don't get what like the big gotcha was from
his father. It wasn't. So he didn't need to

704
01:02:07,982 --> 01:02:08,983
be that contemplative.

705
01:02:12,834 --> 01:02:17,415
He was just like his father, Nikolai, maybe,
and maybe contemplating his brother's turn,

706
01:02:17,836 --> 01:02:22,818
but it was a strange ending. Also, I think there
was a deleted scene here somewhere because

707
01:02:22,858 --> 01:02:27,760
this was the only shot we see of Kraven wearing
his lion vest, but in the trailers for the

708
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:33,882
movie, we had a shot of him in the forest carrying
a torch wearing the same lion's vest. So like

709
01:02:33,902 --> 01:02:38,044
there was supposed to be a whole scene after
this, I think, that just got cut. Yeah, I think

710
01:02:38,084 --> 01:02:43,134
it was probably meant to be an after credits
scene that they just decided to nix. Maybe

711
01:02:43,154 --> 01:02:47,595
he like goes into a cave and he strikes up the
torch and he looks at the ceiling of the cave

712
01:02:47,615 --> 01:02:52,656
and he sees Morbius hanging upside down or some
shit. That'd have been funny. And Morbius is

713
01:02:52,676 --> 01:02:59,278
like, I'm about to Morb. It's Morbin time. But
yeah, there are no end credit scenes or mid

714
01:02:59,318 --> 01:03:04,319
credit scenes for this movie. It just ends and
is likely Sony's way of just kind of like,

715
01:03:04,579 --> 01:03:08,881
you know, cutting this whole franchise off in
an attempt to not lose more money because that's

716
01:03:08,901 --> 01:03:13,582
what these movies are doing. I guess Venom is
making them money. but Madame Webb and Kraven

717
01:03:13,602 --> 01:03:17,563
the Hunter certainly is not going to earn them
any profits. Which is another reason why it's

718
01:03:17,603 --> 01:03:22,225
weird that Sony didn't stagger these releases,
because film studios are always looking for

719
01:03:22,645 --> 01:03:28,347
good years in terms of revenue, so if they figured
that Kraven was going to do bad, like just

720
01:03:28,487 --> 01:03:33,409
push it to the next fiscal year when he won't
have to deal with that. Well, sometimes fiscal

721
01:03:33,449 --> 01:03:37,195
years end in June, First of all, and second
of all, I don't think they knew that Kraven

722
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:41,459
the Hunter was going to do poorly at the box
office. We all knew! They legitimately think

723
01:03:41,519 --> 01:03:45,282
that every time they make a movie, they're going
to profit off of it. If that was the case,

724
01:03:45,502 --> 01:03:50,125
they would have left that end teaser scene then.
I mean, that was probably a change made at

725
01:03:50,145 --> 01:03:54,469
the 11th hour when they realized that this franchise
isn't going anywhere and that they should probably

726
01:03:54,669 --> 01:03:58,392
rethink what they're doing with it and just
focus on the next Spider-Man movie. Maybe.

727
01:03:58,612 --> 01:04:03,982
I don't know. Who knows? No one knows. In all,
I can totally see where people might like this

728
01:04:04,022 --> 01:04:08,824
film more than me. Again, it has great action,
and if you're not particularly invested in

729
01:04:08,844 --> 01:04:14,306
the source material, you're probably fine with
the characterizations as portrayed here. However,

730
01:04:14,486 --> 01:04:19,687
I am cursed with the burden of knowledge, and
despite Aaron Taylor Johnson's charisma and

731
01:04:19,727 --> 01:04:25,489
his prowess in the role, the film's well-crafted
action is staggered by the puzzling character

732
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:30,762
choices and unbalanced plotting. I'm giving
the film two and a half stars out of five,

733
01:04:31,283 --> 01:04:37,685
a rotten rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In the end,
I just don't recommend the movie. I don't think

734
01:04:37,705 --> 01:04:41,086
there's any reason to see it, especially if
you're a fan of these characters from the comics.

735
01:04:41,666 --> 01:04:45,947
I do think two and a half stars is a little
harsh. That's the same rating we gave Joker

736
01:04:45,967 --> 01:04:51,349
Follyard due. And I think there's a lot more
reasons to not like Joker than Kraven that

737
01:04:51,489 --> 01:04:56,451
said, again, I'm not like a huge fan of the
character of Kraven, where I think his story

738
01:04:56,491 --> 01:05:00,733
from the comics is something sacred. I would
give it three stars, I think just one half

739
01:05:00,773 --> 01:05:06,075
star above that, but it is your review. Yeah,
well, I think you rate DC films too high to

740
01:05:06,095 --> 01:05:11,277
begin with. I have more standards, I think,
than you do. I don't want to rate this film

741
01:05:11,378 --> 01:05:16,320
as high as I did Morbius, which I think was
also not a great film, but at least they got

742
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:21,102
the characterization of the comic book character
right in Michael Morbius. To me... Kraven the

743
01:05:21,142 --> 01:05:26,146
Hunter was more along the lines of quality of
Venom Let There Be Carnage. It was better than

744
01:05:26,186 --> 01:05:30,149
Madame Web, but I think they're pretty close
to each other. Really, at the end of the day,

745
01:05:30,329 --> 01:05:34,853
this film is Kraven in name only. That's my
biggest gripe with it. You're giving it the

746
01:05:34,873 --> 01:05:39,717
same rating as Madame Web. Right. But it was
better than Madame Web. But it's also not as

747
01:05:39,737 --> 01:05:45,622
good as Morbius. It is way better than Morbius.
Morbius fucking sucked. What did I just say?

748
01:05:45,742 --> 01:05:51,786
The Morbius film was closer to what a Morbius
film should be. than the Kraven film was to

749
01:05:51,826 --> 01:05:57,649
what a Kraven film should be. The only problem
I have with that is that Morbius was way goofier

750
01:05:57,669 --> 01:06:02,011
than Kraven was. Like with Kraven, I feel like
the actors at least took everything seriously.

751
01:06:02,411 --> 01:06:05,973
Even with minor characters like the foreigner,
I didn't mind as much. Like that could have

752
01:06:05,993 --> 01:06:10,935
been a lot more goofy. And I appreciate it when
filmmakers take the tone of the story seriously.

753
01:06:11,195 --> 01:06:16,017
Maybe not the source material seriously, but
it shouldn't be intentionally silly. And I

754
01:06:16,057 --> 01:06:20,258
don't think this was. I don't mind intentionally
silly, I don't think goofiness equates to quality.

755
01:06:20,298 --> 01:06:24,840
Look at Venom, there's some intentionally goofy
moments in Venom, but that's also in keeping

756
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:29,341
with the comic books on that character. Tone
does not dictate quality. I think adheres to

757
01:06:29,361 --> 01:06:34,122
the source material and story plotting play
a larger role in dictating quality. I don't

758
01:06:34,142 --> 01:06:38,163
know if I agree with that, because I think tone
sometimes can dictate quality. You take a look

759
01:06:38,183 --> 01:06:43,185
at the first Joker movie, like that was very
different from anything like the comics, but

760
01:06:43,225 --> 01:06:48,656
it was still a really well made movie. But that
was also like an Elseworlds riff, like clearly

761
01:06:48,977 --> 01:06:53,060
not the comic book character. Like they went
way out of left field with that one. I think

762
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:57,365
this Kraven the Hunter movie was supposed to
be an adaptation of the comic book character

763
01:06:57,565 --> 01:07:01,689
unlike Joker, which you know, we learned in
Joker 2 that wasn't even the real fucking Joker.

764
01:07:01,969 --> 01:07:06,593
I don't know what your argument is. Stan I'm
saying let this be an adaptation and don't

765
01:07:06,633 --> 01:07:14,715
be so beholden to... A treasure hunt film like
the most dangerous game meets national treasure.

766
01:07:14,835 --> 01:07:18,437
That's what this film should have been. This
movie was nothing like that. You can keep arguing,

767
01:07:18,918 --> 01:07:23,560
but that's what I wanted as a fan. And that's
what I think fans would have supported. And

768
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:27,182
I think you're seeing now at the box office
that people are not supporting this film and

769
01:07:27,202 --> 01:07:31,385
they're not liking it with the poorest cinema
score out of any of the Sony Spider-Man universe

770
01:07:31,405 --> 01:07:37,068
films and like a 15% score on Rotten Tomatoes.
You've mentioned before early on in the podcast,

771
01:07:37,128 --> 01:07:43,447
I would say that you will rate a film lower
if you can envision a better story. And I,

772
01:07:43,467 --> 01:07:48,650
well, I think you've definitely come up with
a better story just in like your five second

773
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:54,133
pitch that you did. I think you also want to
examine the film as it is, not as it necessarily

774
01:07:54,213 --> 01:08:00,377
could have been. Oh, I did. I did. And you heard
it all here. Okay. All right. You're my friend

775
01:08:00,437 --> 01:08:06,380
are not only cursed with knowledge, but also
just damn good story sense and high standards.

776
01:08:06,921 --> 01:08:07,481
Woe is me.

777
01:08:10,542 --> 01:08:16,934
