This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:29,453
Hi, welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,493 --> 00:00:34,916
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters and stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:35,376 --> 00:00:41,780
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous
Joe. And in this episode, we are doing a review

5
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:47,943
of the Harley Quinn spinoff series, Kite Man.
Hell yeah. It wrapped up season one a while

6
00:00:47,983 --> 00:00:52,262
ago, but we're just getting around to it now
because, of course, everything else... from

7
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:56,204
Marvel and DC has been released within the past
few weeks and these upcoming weeks. There's

8
00:00:56,224 --> 00:01:01,327
gonna be a lot of reviews. Yeah, we are still
in the middle of review hell. Again, bear with

9
00:01:01,367 --> 00:01:05,650
us folks. We will get through all these reviews
eventually. We'll be talking about Kite Man

10
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,012
Hell Yeah later on in this episode. Before that,
we're gonna break down the comic book movie

11
00:01:09,052 --> 00:01:14,195
news to come out this past week, including the
Thunderbolts teaser trailer that was released,

12
00:01:14,535 --> 00:01:19,402
the news that Kyle Chandler has been cast as
Hell Jordan in the Lantern series, and the

13
00:01:19,442 --> 00:01:23,946

Pip pip cheerio. Thanks AJ9K and thanks to

22
00:02:22,151 --> 00:02:27,806
everyone who supports the podcast, including
our patron Abner O'Terry. Whose birthday was

23
00:02:27,846 --> 00:02:32,991
this past week? Happy birthday Abner. Happy
birthday. If I could get you a birthday gift

24
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:40,278
from Marvel, I would get you Cyclops Ruby Quartz
Visor because even though you don't shoot optic

25
00:02:40,298 --> 00:02:45,542
blasts from your eyes, at least it would block
you from UV rays and the sun. Oh, does Ruby

26
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:51,027
Quartz do that? I don't know. I'm just gonna
make that assumption. Well, in that case, I

27
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:55,830
would get you the Penguin's Parasol. Cause that
for sure is going to protect you from those

28
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,851
harmful sun rays. Plus it shoots bullets. I
mean, winter is coming up. I don't know why

29
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:04,993
we're doing this, but whatever. Happy birthday,
man. Happy birthday. Thanks for being a patron.

in the Dynomic Podcast Network. But with that

43
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:17,303
out of the way, quick to the no prize. A no
prize is an award Marvel used to give out to

44
00:04:17,343 --> 00:04:22,807
fans. Our version, the Dynamic duel No Prize,
is a digital award we post on Instagram for

45
00:04:22,827 --> 00:04:27,191
the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week we asked

46
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:32,495
you guys, what musician would you cast as a
live action Marvel or DC character and what

47
00:04:32,535 --> 00:04:37,078
character would that be? And this is coming
off of Lady Gaga's casting in the upcoming

48
00:04:37,278 --> 00:04:42,038
Joker Follyado film. You guys came out of the
woodwork for this question even though Apparently

49
00:04:42,078 --> 00:04:46,659
we've already asked it before like a couple
years ago when Lady Gaga was first cast But

50
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:50,920
we got a lot of great new answers So let's go
ahead and run them down as well as our no prize

51
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:57,963
winner our first honorable mention goes to Travis
Herndon who said let's our dynamic dudes Travis

52
00:04:58,003 --> 00:05:03,564
here shout out to my evil twin So my answer
would have to be the great ice cube as what

53
00:05:03,584 --> 00:05:10,066
character you ask Luke Cage I mean, he's got
that look He got the swagger, he got the attitude.

54
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:17,228
I think Ice Cube could pull off a cool ass Luke
Cage. I mean, come on, he got the look. And

55
00:05:17,308 --> 00:05:21,189
I could definitely see him rocking the yellow
tee, painting tea in the bracelet. So yeah,

56
00:05:21,369 --> 00:05:26,651
Ice Cube is Luke Cage. I thought this was a
fantastic answer. I think Ice Cube would definitely

57
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:31,732
make a great Luke Cage because he definitely
has the attitude, right? But part of me also

58
00:05:31,932 --> 00:05:36,493
hates this answer because I feel like I would
wanna give Cube a lot of flak for representing

59
00:05:36,814 --> 00:05:42,835
Harlem over Compton, you know, I think it would
be weird for rap fans to see cube representing

60
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:47,177
the East Side. Yeah, they'd have to like retcon
the character in the film universe so that

61
00:05:47,237 --> 00:05:51,718
yeah, he's from California. There you go. Not
New York. I mean, otherwise you'd have to get

62
00:05:51,758 --> 00:05:56,099
like someone from the Wu-Tang Clan or I don't
know, Puff Daddy, although he's in a lot of

63
00:05:56,119 --> 00:06:01,501
trouble right now. So maybe not him. Yeah, not
him. Puff Daddy, Diddy, whatever he's calling

64
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:07,455
himself, the Diddler, that guy. Great answer,
Travis. Our next honorable mention goes to

65
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:13,037
John Speas, who said, Hey fellas, John Speas
here. This one's a little far out, but stay

66
00:06:13,057 --> 00:06:22,201
with me. I would cast Danny Elfman as Norman
Osborn, the Green Goblin. I think he's just

67
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:28,103
crazy enough to do it. There you go. So one
of the reasons Willem Dafoe was such a great

68
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:32,225
Norman Osborn is because he has a goblin face.
I've been saying this for years, but there

69
00:06:32,265 --> 00:06:38,160
is another person in this world. who also has
a natural goblin face. And that man is Danny

70
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,964
Elfman, the former singer for Oingo Boingo,
and of course the famous film composer, you

71
00:06:43,984 --> 00:06:49,168
know, who actually wrote the music for the initial
Sam Raimi Spider-Man trilogy. I think he would

72
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:53,571
be a great Norman Osborn. I think he'd be an
even better Green Goblin. You know who he would

73
00:06:53,591 --> 00:06:59,235
be perfect casting for though? Who? Cletus Kasady
Carnage. He looks exactly like that character

74
00:06:59,255 --> 00:07:04,122
from the comics. Oh, interesting. Yeah, I could
see him as either character. Whenever I think

75
00:07:04,242 --> 00:07:10,367
of characters like Norman Osborn or Cletus Kasady,
I just think of evil Ginger. That's what Danny

76
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:15,051
Elfman is, there you go. Exactly. Great answer,
Jon Spears. Our next honorable mention goes

77
00:07:15,091 --> 00:07:20,415
to... Miggie Mathingian, who said... Hey, what's
up guys, this is Miggie. And this question

78
00:07:20,455 --> 00:07:26,941
was inspired by Lady Gaga, which, uh, who recently
released a single with Bruno Mars, who's Filipino

79
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:31,204
and half Puerto Rican, so I was thinking, oh,
he would be a good vibe because they're both,

80
00:07:31,224 --> 00:07:35,035
like, great dancers and they both have Puerto
Rican. heritage and then I was thinking he

81
00:07:35,055 --> 00:07:39,417
was in a duo with uh it's called silk sonic
with anderson pack who is african-american

82
00:07:39,457 --> 00:07:44,581
and korean heritage just like connor hawke so
I would just Bruno Mars as vibe and anderson

83
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:49,744
pack as connor hawke thanks guys yeah connor
hawke is a pretty obscure character he's the

84
00:07:49,824 --> 00:07:54,327
son of green arrow and took up the green arrow
mantle for a while not a terrible answer I

85
00:07:54,387 --> 00:08:00,531
do like Bruno Mars as vibe a little bit more
just because I feel like Bruno Mars as Vibe

86
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:06,496
is like peak casting for the character of Vibe.
Like you cannot do better casting than that.

87
00:08:06,696 --> 00:08:12,541
If Vibe ever was cast as Bruno Mars, like the
character has arrived. Like he's A-list now.

88
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:17,805
That's right, because the character Vibe has
a music background in the comic books, right?

89
00:08:18,225 --> 00:08:22,609
Right, exactly. He was a break dancer. But you
know, you could turn it into like Bruno Mars

90
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:27,533
smooth style of dancing. I don't know what you
call it. It's smooth as hell, though. I think

91
00:08:27,553 --> 00:08:32,796
it's just hip hop style. Boom. Smooth hip hop
style. I like Anderson Paak though. He did

92
00:08:32,836 --> 00:08:37,139
some music for the Shang-Chi soundtrack and
yeah, he definitely looks like Connor Hawk.

93
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,823
I think the Anderson Paak casting is peak casting
too. So great answer, Miggy. We wanna give

94
00:08:41,883 --> 00:08:47,106
a special shout out to Brandon Estregard who
said Jenny Ico is Poison Ivy. Cyrus Moore who

95
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:52,730
said Justin Timberlake as the Riddler. Daniel
Alonso who said Ren Gill as Ragdoll. Josh Hayward

96
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:58,110
said Post Malone as Tattoo Man. Kat Stevens
said Metallica as The Sinister Six. Luke Bradley

97
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:03,431
said Taylor Swift as Dazzler, Mason Thompson
said Childish Gambino as the Hypno Hustler,

98
00:09:03,691 --> 00:09:08,193
and Mike Williams forgot to leave an answer.
But he called in anyway and we appreciate that.

99
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:14,935
But the winner of this week's No Prize is Judson
Batty, who said, Hi guys, Judson Batty here.

100
00:09:15,195 --> 00:09:20,996
I know the chances are incredibly unlikely,
but I would cast Elton John as Arcade, the

101
00:09:21,116 --> 00:09:26,946
X-Men villain. I think he's got the looks pretty
much on par. And it's not a very physical role,

102
00:09:27,006 --> 00:09:33,128
so the older age wouldn't be much of an issue.
And I feel like Arcade's the sort of random

103
00:09:33,168 --> 00:09:37,630
character who can get away with bursting into
song or any of that sort of stuff in a similar

104
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:43,131
way that Joker could. I think it would just
be a very funny thing to watch. Right. He got

105
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:48,433
cut off there, but this is the perfect answer
people. Yes. Elton John as the X-Men villain

106
00:09:48,793 --> 00:09:54,500
Arcade. If you guys don't know who Arcade is,
he is a trickster villain for the X-Men who

107
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:00,542
sets up really elaborate video game and amusement
park death traps for heroes. And if you guys

108
00:10:00,562 --> 00:10:05,304
have seen the sequel to Kingsman, which was
called Kingsman and the Golden Circle, you've

109
00:10:05,364 --> 00:10:10,566
seen Elton John in that film and you know just
how perfect an answer this is because he was

110
00:10:10,626 --> 00:10:16,669
fucking hilarious in Kingsman and he kicked
a whole lot of ass in that movie and he's a

111
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:21,207
great musician. So you gotta give it to him.
Yeah, Elton John is a very colorful character

112
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:27,329
and arcade creates very colorful and chaotic
environments for the X-Men. I think it totally

113
00:10:27,349 --> 00:10:33,132
works. Plus, you know, when I think of arcade,
I think of evil ginger. And that's also what

114
00:10:33,172 --> 00:10:38,514
I think of when I think of Elton John. What
do you have against gingers, man? Well, nothing

115
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:43,756
against gingers, just the evil ones. Oh, OK.
All right. That makes sense. I just want to

116
00:10:43,816 --> 00:10:50,495
see the X-Men escaping a death trap. to the
tune of Tiny Dancer while we see Arcade singing

117
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:55,737
that song. Yes. MCU X-Men, get it done. Kevin
Feige, hope you're listening. Great answer

118
00:10:55,777 --> 00:10:59,338
Judson, you win this week's note prize. If you
the listener want a shot at winning your own

119
00:10:59,398 --> 00:11:04,200
note prize, stay tuned to later on in this episode
when we'll be asking another question of the

120
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:07,201
week. And now that that's done, onto the news!

121
00:11:12,782 --> 00:11:18,427
Alright, just over a week ago we got the first
trailer for Marvel Studios' Thunderbolts asterisk

122
00:11:18,587 --> 00:11:24,972
movie that's gonna come out in theaters in May
of 2025. And I thought this was a fantastic

123
00:11:24,992 --> 00:11:29,957
trailer. It was pretty much exactly what we
saw from the D23 Thunderbolts presentation,

124
00:11:30,137 --> 00:11:33,320
but with some additional footage toward the
end. And I thought that was one of the more

125
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:38,525
promising looks to come out of D23 was this
footage. So I'm really pumped for this movie.

126
00:11:38,825 --> 00:11:45,057
Okay, I'm- Also really pumped by how cool this
trailer was. This looks like the Avengers,

127
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:50,161
but cooler to me. The Avengers are already really
cool. So I don't know what you mean by that.

128
00:11:50,201 --> 00:11:53,904
But yeah, but I'm just talking about like the
cast of characters here. Like when this project

129
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:57,847
was first announced and they were talking about
the lineup, I was like, oh damn, like that's

130
00:11:58,267 --> 00:12:03,190
a pretty damn cool lineup. Like you're essentially
just taking Marvel's coolest characters that

131
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:08,290
are like still alive and like putting them together.
But I'm also not gonna lie. When I first saw

132
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:13,653
this, I also thought, okay, I see what they're
going for. Fucking the Suicide Squad. First

133
00:12:13,693 --> 00:12:17,675
of all, they're completely different concepts.
Like, the Thunderbolts is all about reformed

134
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:22,538
heroes actually working to do good. It's not
under threat of getting your head exploded

135
00:12:22,578 --> 00:12:26,920
or something like that. That's fair. But can
you admit it? I want to see you admit it. That,

136
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:32,103
yeah, this looks like it's taking inspiration
from the Suicide Squad. I think that if this

137
00:12:32,263 --> 00:12:37,185
was ripped off of Suicide Squad, it's going
to be a million times better than any iteration.

138
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:43,430
of the Suicide Squad anything ever was. Especially
that 2016 movie, right? You mean the Oscar

139
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:48,393
winning Suicide Squad 2016 movie? Fuck off.
All right, anyway, the trailer starts with

140
00:12:48,573 --> 00:12:53,697
Yelena Belova visiting her surrogate father,
Alexei Shostakov, played by David Harbour,

141
00:12:53,717 --> 00:12:58,861
who I think gives a great performance as the
Red Guardian. I love the moment where she knocks

142
00:12:58,901 --> 00:13:03,024
on the door and he's trying to get things cleaned
up for her so that she could come in. And he

143
00:13:03,044 --> 00:13:07,831
brushes his teeth with his finger and dish soap.
Like, just the whole character is just hilarious.

144
00:13:08,112 --> 00:13:12,435
Sure, he's used for comic relief and sure, the
team already has like five different versions

145
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:17,799
of a super soldier, but I'm here for it. Oh,
yeah. No, David Harbour is fantastic as the

146
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:22,203
Red Guardian. He was one of the best parts to
come out of the Black Widow movie. I thought

147
00:13:22,243 --> 00:13:27,006
I'm really glad that we're getting to see him
again. His comedic timing is so subtle yet

148
00:13:27,146 --> 00:13:32,570
so good. I'm guessing that he's not with Melina
Vostokov anymore. played by Rachel Weisz in

149
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:36,311
the Black Widow movie. And that's why he's kind
of down and out here. She must've dumped him

150
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:41,633
or something. But Yulana talks about how she's
also depressed and she's been diving into her

151
00:13:41,693 --> 00:13:47,475
work. One of her jobs puts her at odds with
John Walker, the US agent, Ghost from Ant-Man

152
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:53,496
and the Wasp, Taskmaster with a very different
costume here, and Bob Reynolds the Sentry.

153
00:13:53,937 --> 00:13:58,754
Well yeah, Taskmaster and Ghost both have very
different costumes. Yeah, I like Ghost's costume.

154
00:13:58,834 --> 00:14:03,097
She actually removes her mask here, which I
thought was interesting because Taskmaster

155
00:14:03,197 --> 00:14:08,980
did not. I know Olga Korolenko is cast in the
film. I'm not certain why they're so afraid

156
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,682
to show her face though, considering we all
know who she is. Well, I don't know, maybe

157
00:14:12,742 --> 00:14:16,605
some people who haven't seen Black Widow still
don't know that Taskmaster has been gender

158
00:14:16,645 --> 00:14:21,307
swapped. I'm wondering if it's in fact the same
Taskmaster or if it's somebody else. Oh, that's

159
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:26,234
interesting. I don't know. That's hearsay, but
we'll see what happens. I am intrigued by the

160
00:14:26,254 --> 00:14:30,656
fact though that Taskmaster never takes off
her mask. The fight between the group in that

161
00:14:30,696 --> 00:14:35,578
warehouse bunker was fantastic. I thought it
was really cool to see how they can play off

162
00:14:35,618 --> 00:14:40,560
each other even though they had never met each
other until this point. But they're so in tune

163
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:44,502
that they're able to counter each other's moves
as they're being made. It's pretty interesting.

164
00:14:44,962 --> 00:14:49,304
Yeah, of course, and then the sentry pops out
of nowhere. Yeah, of course, that role was

165
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:52,925
originally played by Steven Yoon and I kind
of wish he was still in the role because I

166
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:56,452
think that would have been a f- Fascinating
character for him to play now. He's being played

167
00:14:56,492 --> 00:15:00,595
by Lewis Pullman still pretty interesting here
I'm really interested in seeing where they

168
00:15:00,615 --> 00:15:04,578
take the character and how faithful they will
be to the comics We do see in a shot later

169
00:15:04,678 --> 00:15:08,502
on that he's being shot at by a group of guards
and all the bullets are basically Bouncing

170
00:15:08,562 --> 00:15:12,845
off of him and not hurting him So he'll be a
cool character if you guys don't know much

171
00:15:12,885 --> 00:15:17,069
about the sentry and want to learn more check
out our episode where? We put him against general

172
00:15:17,129 --> 00:15:23,562
Zod. I wonder if these Thunderbolt characters
were sent in there to kill Bob the sentry or

173
00:15:23,602 --> 00:15:28,126
if they were sent in there for him to kill them.
That's a great question. We don't know what's

174
00:15:28,186 --> 00:15:33,030
really going on because we see Bucky attack
the Thunderbolts group later on at the end

175
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:38,834
of this trailer. So it seems like somebody's
trying to get these people killed but Bucky

176
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:42,998
joins the team, Sentry joins the team. It's
really interesting how this is all playing

177
00:15:43,098 --> 00:15:47,802
out. And which of them is being manipulated
by the Contessa Valentina Allegra da Fontaine,

178
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:52,842
played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who apparently
has bought Stark Tower. and she's throwing

179
00:15:52,882 --> 00:15:57,003
parties with like Loki Scepter in them and everything
like that. She puts together the Thunderbolts

180
00:15:57,163 --> 00:16:03,485
and the MCU has been hinting at her involvement
in films like Black Widow and shows like Hawkeye

181
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:07,646
and the Falcon and the Witcher Soldier. And
Wakanda Forever. Oh yeah, that's right. She

182
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:12,207
was in that too. It'll be nice to finally get
that payoff of what her motives are and what's

183
00:16:12,227 --> 00:16:17,088
all going on here. Fingers are still crossed
that she's Letharian. Yeah, if they like maybe

184
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:21,069
merge her character with Lucia von Bardis or
something like that, that could be pretty cool.

185
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:28,259
Again, Thunderbolts asterisk comes out on May
2nd, 2025. And speaking of that asterisk, that

186
00:16:28,359 --> 00:16:31,101
asterisk though, that brings us to our question
of the week.

187
00:16:35,542 --> 00:16:40,546
What is your theory as to what the asterisk
means in the Thunderbolts movie title? There

188
00:16:40,566 --> 00:16:44,750
are a lot of rumors out there, some of them
more common than others, but we want to know

194
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:15,273
before October 5th. Moving on to DC news, Kyle
Chandler has been set to star in HBO's Lanterns

195
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:21,336
series for the DC Universe. This will be produced
by both James Gunn and Peter Safran. Of course,

196
00:17:21,376 --> 00:17:26,779
Chris Mundy and Damon Lindelof have been announced
as writers for the series. There's been some

197
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:31,998
speculation for a while now as to who was going
to be playing Cal Jordan. And we had A-list

198
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:37,241
talent in the running, including Josh Brolin
and Matthew McConaughey, Chris Pine, Timothy

199
00:17:37,281 --> 00:17:44,425
Elephant. But ultimately it came down to Kyle
Chandler of Friday Night Lights fame. And I

200
00:17:44,465 --> 00:17:50,908
gotta say, I'm not thrilled by the news, especially
considering the names we could have gotten

201
00:17:50,928 --> 00:17:55,211
and the names that were being thrown around.
It's kind of hard to get excited about Kyle

202
00:17:55,231 --> 00:18:00,293
Chandler. I feel kind of let down by that. I
think it's kind of funny. I think out of...

203
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:05,295
everyone you could have gotten. Nobody expected
Kyle Chandler to get the job. I mean, he'll

204
00:18:05,315 --> 00:18:10,858
be serviceable. He's been in a few movies. He's
popped up in like Godzilla, King of Monsters,

205
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:17,400
and he was in the Neil Armstrong biopic First
Man. He's just not a household name. And I

206
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:22,383
guess I kind of assumed that Hal Jordan would
be considering the last actor to play him was

207
00:18:22,463 --> 00:18:28,405
Ryan Reynolds. You know, we didn't get a version
of Hal Jordan in the Snyderverse. So I kind

208
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:34,880
of thought that they make up for the bad reception
of Ryan Reynolds film by casting someone really

209
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:38,722
big in the role to say hey Hal Jordan is still
really important to us he's still a really

210
00:18:38,762 --> 00:18:43,364
big character so much so in fact that we got
this actor i guess that's not the case though

211
00:18:43,804 --> 00:18:49,087
i shouldn't be that disappointed i mean after
all Kyle Chandler is an Emmy-winning actor

212
00:18:49,247 --> 00:18:53,989
like you said he'll be serviceable considering
the talent behind the scenes i'm not too concerned

213
00:18:54,009 --> 00:18:58,884
about the direction of the show I was just expecting
bigger names. It looks like from who's currently

214
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:03,987
in the running for Jon Stewart as well, like
that's not going to be a big name either. Currently

215
00:19:04,027 --> 00:19:10,212
they're looking at Alan Pierre and Stephen James
to play the role of Jon Stewart. Of course,

216
00:19:10,252 --> 00:19:14,975
Alan Pierre is the star of the Netflix thriller
Rebel Ridge and Stephen James was in films

217
00:19:15,015 --> 00:19:20,859
like The Piano Lesson and 21 Bridges. Actually
he starred opposite Chadwick Boseman in 21

218
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:25,166
Bridges and I always thought that Stephen James
would have made a good Black Panther. after

219
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:30,369
Chad Oak Boseman's tragic passing. That said,
I'll be fine to take him for the DC Universe.

220
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:34,932
He's actually my favorite pick out of those
two for Jon Stewart. Yeah, same here. I'd like

221
00:19:34,972 --> 00:19:37,954
to see him get the role. I think he could pull
it off and I think he'd be a great addition

222
00:19:37,995 --> 00:19:43,338
to the DC film universe too, if they end up
putting Jon Stewart in a Justice League roster

223
00:19:43,398 --> 00:19:48,201
down the line. Apparently they're looking to
make a decision for Jon Stewart sooner rather

224
00:19:48,222 --> 00:19:53,085
than later. Maybe by the time we record our
next episode, we'll have our Jon Stewart. So

225
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:59,240
look forward to that. In other DC news, it looks
like James Gunn and Peter Safran are developing

226
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:05,542
a Bane and Deathstroke conjoined film that's
going to be written by Matthew Orton, the same

227
00:20:05,562 --> 00:20:11,745
writer who wrote the upcoming Captain America
Brave New World movie. I have no idea what

228
00:20:11,865 --> 00:20:16,347
that film would look like. Maybe it's just like
an Assassin's movie and there'll be other DC

229
00:20:16,387 --> 00:20:20,549
like assassin or mercenary characters all going
for like a single target or something like

230
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:26,543
that. That sounds pretty cool. Or maybe Deathstroke
has to infiltrate Santa Prisca prison to eliminate

231
00:20:26,603 --> 00:20:30,865
a target and he encounters Bane. I don't know,
it's all speculative right now. I think the

232
00:20:30,905 --> 00:20:35,067
concept is the most intriguing bit of news to
come out of this though. So they never would

233
00:20:35,087 --> 00:20:39,789
have assumed that they would have taken Bane,
who's a Batman villain, and Deathstroke, who's

234
00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:45,111
primarily a Titans villain, and put them in
the same movie. Yeah, that's a pretty odd couple

235
00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:50,253
there. I saw a rumor that said that the film
is potentially setting up a Secret Six movie.

236
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:54,284
Well considering that Deathstroke was not a
part of the Secret Six, I find that hard to

237
00:20:54,324 --> 00:20:58,886
believe. Deadshot was in the Secret Six, so
people might be confusing him for Deathstroke,

238
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:04,229
but I don't know, it might be as good a guess
as any, but I find that hard to believe. As

239
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:08,772
James Gunn has said in the past, they're not
going to greenlight a film until the script

240
00:21:08,912 --> 00:21:14,315
is completed, so who knows when this movie will
be released, if it will at all. But the fact

241
00:21:14,335 --> 00:21:20,078
that they're developing it is just fascinating
in regards to what James Gunn has planned with

242
00:21:20,118 --> 00:21:26,241
these films. Is there a plan? I'm gonna say
no. It's starting to look that way. Like it

243
00:21:26,281 --> 00:21:31,624
may just be a shared universe with no overarching
story. So basically like they have to see you

244
00:21:31,644 --> 00:21:36,126
right now. Oh, during the multiverse saga? Yeah,
kind of, but you see how that's going for them.

245
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:41,769
Yeah, yeah. I don't know. We'll see what happens
with this. We'll keep you guys updated if any

246
00:21:41,849 --> 00:21:43,549
other news surrounding it develops.

247
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:54,861
That does it for all the news for this week,
so now let's move on to the main event of this

248
00:21:54,901 --> 00:22:00,985
episode where we review season 1 of the Max
animated series, Kite Man. Hell yeah.

249
00:22:17,262 --> 00:22:22,945
Hell yeah is a spin-off series of the critically
and fan-acclaimed animated max-exclusive series

250
00:22:23,065 --> 00:22:29,008
Harley Quinn, for which we've reviewed two seasons
and a Valentine's Day special on this podcast.

251
00:22:29,428 --> 00:22:34,131
Harley Quinn is a good series, with enough over-the-top
violence and raunchy humor to entertain its

252
00:22:34,171 --> 00:22:39,094
mature audiences, but also a surprising amount
of heart and psychological insight into the

253
00:22:39,134 --> 00:22:44,757
characters of Gotham that make it relatively
groundbreaking amidst DC's massive library

254
00:22:44,817 --> 00:22:50,961
of animated fare. Now despite the success of
The Harley Quinn Show, I had mediocre expectations

255
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:56,485
for season one of Kite Man Hell Yeah, a series
based on a D-list Batman villain and minor,

256
00:22:56,746 --> 00:23:02,150
albeit charming side characters from Harley
Quinn. The Harley Quinn Show already features

257
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:08,014
a pretty obscure cast of Gotham characters,
so would a show that scrapes even further into

258
00:23:08,035 --> 00:23:13,194
the bottom of the barrel actually work? I'm
glad to say it did. I wouldn't go so far as

259
00:23:13,234 --> 00:23:19,156
to recommend the show as must-see TV, but if
you're a fan of the Harley Quinn series, this

260
00:23:19,176 --> 00:23:23,818
show is definitely worth your time, though I
wouldn't expect it to be as innovative. If

261
00:23:23,838 --> 00:23:28,740
you're interested in watching the show but haven't
yet, skip this review for now and come back

262
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:34,003
after you've watched it as this review, like
all of our reviews, will contain spoilers.

263
00:23:34,343 --> 00:23:38,444
Yeah, I'm not sure this show has any appeal
to people who aren't fans of the Harley Quinn

264
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:46,053
comedy, you might still find something here
to enjoy. The show is actually pretty different

265
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:51,076
from what I was expecting it to be. I thought
it was going to be much more of a sitcom, something

266
00:23:51,176 --> 00:23:55,800
like Cheers, but it actually ended up having
more of an overarching story than I thought

267
00:23:55,820 --> 00:24:01,063
it was going to have. For the most part, the
show is purely focused on laughs, though it

268
00:24:01,103 --> 00:24:06,427
does revolve somewhat around the romance of
its two lead characters, Kite Man and his girlfriend

269
00:24:06,447 --> 00:24:12,275
of 14 months, Golden Glider, an obscure Flash
villain. The two work well together, though

270
00:24:12,315 --> 00:24:17,979
I'd say most of the laughs don't come from their
interactions. Rather, most of the show's humor

271
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:23,262
comes from the ensemble of recurring side characters
that frequent the bar Kite Man and Golden Glider

272
00:24:23,322 --> 00:24:28,526
purchased in episode 1. This includes Bane,
a character from the Harley Quinn show and

273
00:24:28,626 --> 00:24:34,330
my favorite of the bunch, Malice Vunderbar,
a trendy apocalyptic socialite forced to work

274
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:40,294
at the bar, Sean Noonan, the aloof former owner
of the bar who knows all of its secrets, The

275
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:45,196
Queen of Fables, also from Harley Quinn, now
just a decapitated head looking for a body.

276
00:24:45,716 --> 00:24:52,139
Joe and Moe doubles, mobster conjoined twins
with two heads. Six pack, a lewd drunkard and

277
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:58,821
wannabe villain I think. And a random ass guy
named Gus. Now most of the ensemble works,

278
00:24:58,881 --> 00:25:04,024
particularly Bane, Malice, and Noonan. Like
Bane's obsessive nature and Mack forgetting

279
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:10,646
himself into embarrassing situations are hilarious.
I thought Malice was going to be annoying when

280
00:25:10,686 --> 00:25:15,407
we were first introduced to the character, but
she ended up being a fantastic foil for Golden

281
00:25:15,427 --> 00:25:19,969
Glider, and her demonic cat Cheshire allowed
Malice to get involved in some of the show's

282
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:25,130
action scenes. Noonan was great as a loyal mentor
figure for Kite Man not only when it came to

283
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:31,252
running a seedy bar in Gotham, but also in navigating
relationships. Some of the cast, however, like

284
00:25:31,292 --> 00:25:38,230
the doubles twins Sixpack and Daryl, were good
for maybe one joke the entire season. It's

285
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:43,372
always been interesting to see how some characters
are adapted in this quote-unquote quin-verse

286
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:48,074
like a character like Malice. And I would have
much rather seen other D-list villains frequenting

287
00:25:48,274 --> 00:25:54,117
Noonan's than some of what we got here. Yeah,
actually going back to your idea that the premise

288
00:25:54,137 --> 00:25:58,959
was going to be more of a sitcom where we see
a revolving cast of D-list villains showing

289
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:03,841
up at the bar, I was surprised at the lack of
cameos and stuff that we got from this show.

290
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:09,911
Yeah, we got Frank the Plant, we got Clayface,
we got Martian Manhunter just out of fucking

291
00:26:10,091 --> 00:26:16,373
nowhere. But yeah, I thought we were going to
get a lot more villains. Now regarding the

292
00:26:16,413 --> 00:26:22,214
humor, the show's irreverent gags are pretty
much nonstop, and most of the jokes land, especially

293
00:26:22,254 --> 00:26:27,616
as the season progresses and continues to build
on past jokes. Like in Harley Quinn, there's

294
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:32,797
a touch of commentary in the humor, particularly
when it comes to one of the show's three villains,

295
00:26:33,117 --> 00:26:40,143
Helen Villigan. who turned her themed bar, Villigans,
into an online Amazon slash Google-esque data

296
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:46,869
empire that spies on its user base in a send-up
of big tech and capitalistic excess. Usually

297
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:53,514
LexCorp fills that role in DC media, so I'm
not convinced that Helen Villigan was necessary,

298
00:26:53,615 --> 00:26:59,700
especially considering Lex Luther already serves
as one of the season's villains. He was voiced

299
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:05,296
by Lance Riddick of John Wick fame. for eight
episodes before his untimely passing. Yeah,

300
00:27:05,316 --> 00:27:09,958
for as ubiquitous as Villigans was in this universe,
you think that we would have seen Villigans

301
00:27:10,018 --> 00:27:14,581
in the Harley Quinn show. We might have maybe
if they were setting this up, but I just don't

302
00:27:14,621 --> 00:27:20,244
remember Villigans any time prior to this season.
No, I think she was made up for the show. Although

303
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:26,648
that's not entirely true. I was able to find
a character named Helen Helligan. I don't know

304
00:27:26,668 --> 00:27:31,446
if they're the same though. You think they have
to be. Well, Helen Helligan is an FBI agent,

305
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:38,368
not a villain. Well, never mind then. Now, the
surprise villain for me was Darkseid, who we've

306
00:27:38,388 --> 00:27:42,989
seen in past seasons of Harley Quinn. But, you
know, to make the central conflict of the season

307
00:27:43,069 --> 00:27:48,391
revolve around the anti-life equation made for
some pretty lofty stakes for a show about D-list

308
00:27:48,451 --> 00:27:52,932
villains. Considering the high stakes, I thought
the conflict would have been more appropriate

309
00:27:52,952 --> 00:27:57,693
for a fifth season of Harley Quinn or better
yet, maybe like a Suicide Squad spin-off series.

310
00:27:58,102 --> 00:28:02,583
that I think people would have been much more
interested in than Kite Man. Now seeing Kite

311
00:28:02,623 --> 00:28:06,844
Man in the Suicide Squad would have been much
more interesting to me than seeing him run

312
00:28:06,884 --> 00:28:12,066
a bar. That's just an idea, though. Like for
me, the premise of Kite Man running a bar is

313
00:28:12,086 --> 00:28:17,488
almost like a web series at best. Right. But
it definitely has great potential in the sort

314
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:22,418
of sitcom style. Like you, I was hoping the
show would go a different route because. I

315
00:28:22,458 --> 00:28:27,220
don't think we need another Harley Quinn series,
essentially. This show explored a lot of different

316
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,522
things, but I'm wondering how they're going
to incorporate what happened in this show into

317
00:28:31,542 --> 00:28:35,923
the upcoming Harley Quinn season. If we're going
to see a lot of these characters jumping back

318
00:28:35,943 --> 00:28:39,845
and forth, I think they're kind of basically
setting themselves up for a continuity nightmare,

319
00:28:39,965 --> 00:28:43,867
especially in this universe which is so wacky
that almost anything can go from episode to

320
00:28:43,887 --> 00:28:49,509
episode. Yeah, I definitely agree. To me, this
could have also just been a subplot within.

321
00:28:49,942 --> 00:28:53,723
the next season of Harley Quinn. Like maybe
get rid of some of the minor subplots from

322
00:28:53,783 --> 00:28:58,846
this series, like Queen of Fables looking for
a body to attach her head to or something like

323
00:28:58,906 --> 00:29:03,748
that. And just, you know, get it streamlined
and insert it into the Harley Quinn show. I

324
00:29:03,768 --> 00:29:07,990
think that could have worked. Exactly. And let
me just say this. It shouldn't have been Kite

325
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:13,172
Man who got his own spinoff show. For as funny
as Kite Man is, he didn't have as much to do

326
00:29:13,232 --> 00:29:19,484
here as like Harley Quinn does in say her own
show. It's more about this whole cast of characters,

327
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:24,228
including Bane, who has probably just as much,
if not more, screen time than Kite Man does.

328
00:29:24,328 --> 00:29:28,712
I think this should have been a Bane spinoff,
because to me, he's the standout from the Harley

329
00:29:28,732 --> 00:29:33,155
Quinn show, not Kite Man. Yeah, he's the standout
from both shows, Harley Quinn and Kite Man,

330
00:29:33,215 --> 00:29:37,599
I felt. I would love to see Bane get his own
show, and I agree he probably should have gotten

331
00:29:37,639 --> 00:29:43,163
his before Kite Man did. Now, regarding the
romance of the series, it truly is the heart

332
00:29:43,283 --> 00:29:48,539
of the show, as it is in the Harley Quinn series.
Kite Man and Golden Glider are great for each

333
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:53,564
other, but let's talk more about them and their
relationship in our character breakdown. Charles

334
00:29:53,644 --> 00:29:59,148
Chuck Brown slash Kite Man was voiced by Matt
Oberg. I haven't talked too much about his

335
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:04,153
voice performance in past seasons of the Harley
Quinn series, but if it wasn't for Oberg's

336
00:30:04,233 --> 00:30:09,357
lovable, loser-esque comedic take on Kite Man,
the character would not have been endearing

337
00:30:09,397 --> 00:30:14,741
enough to sustain his own spinoff series. The
show owes a lot of credit to Oberg's charm.

338
00:30:15,138 --> 00:30:19,699
which I think could translate into live action
if they ever want to put Kite Man in a Suicide

339
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:25,001
Squad film or something like that. For sure.
Yeah, that would be hilarious. The guy's delivery

340
00:30:25,261 --> 00:30:30,542
is something special. I'll say that. It's more
than spot on. It's charming, it's pitiful,

341
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:35,544
it's comedic. It's all of these things in one
package. Yeah, it could go anywhere from super

342
00:30:35,604 --> 00:30:41,514
heroic to super sad and everything in between.
And still be funny all at once. Kite Man's

343
00:30:41,614 --> 00:30:46,718
arc this season revolves around self-acceptance,
and it's an arc that stems from his appearances

344
00:30:46,758 --> 00:30:51,682
in Harley Quinn. He broke off his engagement
to Poison Ivy in that show because he had the

345
00:30:51,742 --> 00:30:57,567
self-worth to not be with a woman he loved who
didn't love him on equal footing. Kite Man

346
00:30:57,627 --> 00:31:01,670
and Golden Glider make a better couple in that
they're both fully committed to each other

347
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:07,135
despite their flaws. But Kite Man becomes insecure
during the show by his father's disapproval,

348
00:31:07,235 --> 00:31:11,990
the appearance of a rival bar like Villigans
across the street, as well as Golden Glider's

349
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:17,311
mom, Rebecca Chen, telling him he's not good
enough for her daughter. So he makes the decision

350
00:31:17,371 --> 00:31:23,133
to go to his rival, Helen Villigan, to gain
a superpower in order to be more than the loser

351
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:28,235
he suddenly feels he is. But by the end of the
season, he learns that he doesn't need a superpower

352
00:31:28,395 --> 00:31:33,556
because his power all along had been his kindness
and friendliness that got him his dream girl

353
00:31:33,676 --> 00:31:39,974
and bar from the very start. The superpower
of Beast Mode. Might be my favorite moment

354
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:48,739
with Kite Man. His douchebag power, it's just
so unbelievably wacky and hilarious. Oftentimes

355
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:53,662
I've been asked if you could have any superpower.
I think I kind of want douchebag superpower.

356
00:31:54,123 --> 00:31:59,365
His power was telekinesis, which was activated
by him throwing up the middle finger, right?

357
00:31:59,846 --> 00:32:03,968
But it would do things like wedgies and pull
people's pants down and titty twisters and

358
00:32:04,008 --> 00:32:10,143
stuff like that. It was just hilarious. I think
that stemmed more from who Beast Mode was as

359
00:32:10,183 --> 00:32:14,465
opposed to what his power was specifically.
Okay. It wasn't like his power was like randomly

360
00:32:14,505 --> 00:32:19,607
doing these douchey things to them, I think.
But yeah, I would love that power in real life.

361
00:32:19,788 --> 00:32:23,389
People who like cut me off in traffic, I just
like throw up the finger and then all of a

362
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:27,931
sudden their car would shut down or something
like that. That type of power does appeal to

363
00:32:27,951 --> 00:32:32,513
me in a totally petty way. Was Beast Mode your
favorite Kite Man moment or did you have another

364
00:32:32,613 --> 00:32:38,494
one? No, there were no like real standout action
moments or anything really heroic for him outside

365
00:32:38,534 --> 00:32:43,739
of the whole Anti-life equation thing at the
end, but even that wasn't really an exciting

366
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:48,864
action moment for him true. Very yeah He didn't
really do anything like impressive with his

367
00:32:48,924 --> 00:32:53,808
kite this season I felt which I was actually
really looking forward to considering our last

368
00:32:53,848 --> 00:32:58,372
episode Which was a duel between kite man and
stilt man, you know all the different kite

369
00:32:58,412 --> 00:33:03,844
gadgets that he has in the comics weren't really
on display in this show, except as random gags.

370
00:33:04,704 --> 00:33:08,387
When he hit his belt and it would shoot out
a bunch of little kite throwing stars and stuff

371
00:33:08,407 --> 00:33:12,730
like that. Yeah, you're right. That was it.
But you know, like Harley Quinn and Kite Man,

372
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:17,653
those shows really aren't about the heroics.
No, but there is a lot of action. So I would

373
00:33:17,693 --> 00:33:23,337
have expected Kite Man to be more involved in
the action more frequently in his own series.

374
00:33:23,877 --> 00:33:28,821
I think the biggest thing he did besides the
Anti-Life Equation thing was punch Baby Doll,

375
00:33:28,861 --> 00:33:34,032
but that happened off camera. Well, you look
at Golden Glider, she got a whole lot of action

376
00:33:34,252 --> 00:33:40,136
in this season. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Lisa Snart
slash Golden Glider. She was voiced by Stephanie

377
00:33:40,197 --> 00:33:45,300
Sue. I think she's a fantastic actress. She
was great as one of the leads in everything

378
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,923
everywhere all at once. And though I didn't
care for her performance at the start of this

379
00:33:49,963 --> 00:33:54,527
season, I think that was more due to the writing
of the character because by the end of the

380
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:59,098
season, I was really happy with the character.
And I think a lot of that has to do. with Sue's

381
00:33:59,118 --> 00:34:04,500
ability to deliver both comedy and drama. I
think at one point we were thinking about pitting

382
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:10,102
Golden Glider against Shadow Cat from Marvel
in a duel episode. And I am totally glad that

383
00:34:10,122 --> 00:34:16,085
we didn't do that because Golden Glider seems
OP as fuck. Well, so this is an interesting

384
00:34:16,205 --> 00:34:23,668
adaptation of Golden Glider because in the past,
Golden Glider was just a really fast skater.

385
00:34:23,788 --> 00:34:30,311
But in the new 52, they re-imagined the character
to be almost like a ghost with blades that's

386
00:34:30,371 --> 00:34:36,455
really fast. So they kind of did both for this
show and that she had this like astral projection

387
00:34:36,495 --> 00:34:41,598
that could shoot out these ribbons that could
either like liquefy or cut people. I actually

388
00:34:41,618 --> 00:34:46,842
think it was a pretty good adaptation of the
character and honestly I hope they adapt that

389
00:34:46,862 --> 00:34:52,326
to the comics. She's a former member of the
Rogues? Yes, that's correct. We'll find a matchup

390
00:34:52,346 --> 00:34:56,349
for her eventually somewhere down the line.
I think maybe Devin has already come up with

391
00:34:56,369 --> 00:35:00,338
that idea, but I'll have to double check. This
is a much better adaptation of the character

392
00:35:00,378 --> 00:35:05,020
from the comics than what they did on the Flash
TV show, which is just give her a gun that

393
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:10,741
turns things gold. Holy shit. That's so stupid.
Yeah, it was kind of ridiculous. But you know

394
00:35:10,761 --> 00:35:15,543
what? I bet you Golden Glider in the Kite Man
show wished she had that power, though. I mean,

395
00:35:15,583 --> 00:35:21,164
who wouldn't? I want that. Yeah, yeah. Now,
like Kite Man, Golden Glider's arc revolves

396
00:35:21,224 --> 00:35:26,522
around insecurity. You know, her insecurity
around using her unstable powers. around her

397
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:32,167
relationship with Kite Man, around the new young,
caught-rich barmaid, her unresolved past, and

398
00:35:32,207 --> 00:35:37,111
around the unrequited love from her mother.
The only thing that keeps her stable is the

399
00:35:37,131 --> 00:35:42,096
shared love between herself and Kite Man, which
makes it all the more tragic at the end of

400
00:35:42,116 --> 00:35:47,320
the season when the only way to seemingly save
the world from the anti-life equation is for

401
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:53,942
Glider to kill Kite Man. That ended up not happening
through a bizarre deus ex machina. But in the

402
00:35:54,022 --> 00:35:58,123
end she admitted that she wouldn't have been
able to kill Kite Man anyway because she loved

403
00:35:58,163 --> 00:36:03,806
him. And though she never overcomes her insecurities
in this season, at least she's supported by

404
00:36:03,826 --> 00:36:09,108
a good partner who brings out the best in her
as she does for him. Hashtag relationship goals.

405
00:36:09,128 --> 00:36:14,751
You know it's interesting that Kite Man and
Golden Glider make such a good couple considering

406
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:19,753
they're both highly insecure people. And neither
of them have like real secure attachments due

407
00:36:19,793 --> 00:36:23,891
to their upbringing and stuff like that. And
usually you need at least one person to have

408
00:36:23,911 --> 00:36:29,234
a secure attachment in a relationship in order
for the relationship to work. Otherwise, you

409
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:32,636
know, the insecurities compound and spiral out
of control. But yeah, they both seem like they

410
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:37,999
have anxious attachments to each other or something.
Well, Kymane is usually very secure, like almost

411
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:43,682
to a fault. Like he should not be as secure
as he is. It wasn't until this season that

412
00:36:43,742 --> 00:36:48,084
he kind of started to feel like, oh, maybe he's
not good enough because, you know, he told

413
00:36:48,484 --> 00:36:52,210
Poison Ivy straight to her face, like, I'm too
good for you. So, you know, that was never

414
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:58,753
really his problem until he started to get serious
with Golden Glider. That's true. That's very

415
00:36:58,773 --> 00:37:03,214
true, actually. I didn't think about that, but
you're absolutely right. He kind of has delusions

416
00:37:03,255 --> 00:37:10,237
of grandeur in his security. Exactly. But that's
kind of the appeal, right? He's a big loser,

417
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:15,499
but he doesn't necessarily know that he's a
big loser. Right. That's 100% the appeal of

418
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:19,281
the character. Because it makes you want to
root for him. He's the underdog. This whole

419
00:37:19,301 --> 00:37:24,621
show is about underdogs. Him, Golden Glider,
Bane, everyone. No, my favorite moment with

420
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:29,125
Golden Glider was actually in the first episode
when she first showed her powers because that's

421
00:37:29,145 --> 00:37:32,488
when I realized how they were adapting the character.
And I was like, okay, they're taking like a

422
00:37:32,528 --> 00:37:38,833
mixture between, you know, pre-New 52 Golden
Glider and post-Flashpoint Golden Glider. The

423
00:37:38,853 --> 00:37:46,099
funniest moments I think were actually, you
know, her naked fighting at the spa, but also

424
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:50,602
her getting her nipples pierced. when she thought
that her mom was going to get it done too,

425
00:37:50,862 --> 00:37:58,526
only to find out that wasn't the case. Oh, so
all the raunchy stuff, okay. Yes. Regarding

426
00:37:58,566 --> 00:38:01,847
the naked fight, that was pretty interesting
because the animators, it seemed like they

427
00:38:01,867 --> 00:38:06,049
tried to Austin Powers the whole choreography
as much as they could in that they were trying

428
00:38:06,089 --> 00:38:10,831
to hide her exposed bits for as long as they
could. But at some point they just said, fuck

429
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:15,392
it, and just decided to blur everything. Right.
And just let it in full view of the camera.

430
00:38:15,492 --> 00:38:18,582
I thought that was pretty interesting why they
just didn't do that from the get go. But I

431
00:38:18,823 --> 00:38:22,476
actually think it would have been more funny
for them to continue the kind of Austin powersing

432
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,025
of the nudity within the fight. That's fair.

440
00:39:19,647 --> 00:39:26,192
Moving on to our story highlights, the first
episode was titled, Pilot Hell Yeah! With the

441
00:39:26,232 --> 00:39:31,697
anti-life equation in his possession, Lex Luthor
reluctantly hires Kite Man as an aerial spy

442
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:36,361
to guard the Legion of Doom against the Justice
League due to the Legion's flying villains

443
00:39:36,401 --> 00:39:41,986
being unavailable. Kite Man fails at his task,
so Luthor takes revenge by attempting to buy

444
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:48,655
Kite Man's hangout, Noonan's Bar, for $10 million.
Kite Man and his girlfriend Golden Glider strive

445
00:39:48,695 --> 00:39:53,660
to raise the money first, but are unable to
borrow it from anyone. Harley Quinn and Poison

446
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:59,004
Ivy advise the two to rob from villains worse
than them. With help from former Legion member

447
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:04,389
Bane, the group attack the mansion of Kite Man's
father, Daryl, who willingly surrenders his

448
00:40:04,429 --> 00:40:10,518
money as a reward for Kite Man finally standing
up to him. Luther's revenge is later revealed

449
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:15,940
to be a deception so that he can hide the anti-life
equation in Nunein's freezer, unaware that

450
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:20,282
Darkseid is also on the hunt for it. Do you
think they did Sinestro dirty in this episode?

451
00:40:20,702 --> 00:40:26,104
They do so many villains dirty in the Harley
Quinn series and this show. I was not happy

452
00:40:26,124 --> 00:40:31,827
with what they did to Sinestro. I was like,
okay, really Lex Luthor? I guess. I thought

453
00:40:31,867 --> 00:40:36,228
that Kite Man's dad, Daryl, giving him the money,
I thought there was going to be some kind of

454
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:40,811
catch to it or something like that. He was going
to reveal like, This is your inheritance I'm

455
00:40:40,851 --> 00:40:44,194
giving it to you now, don't ask me for anything
else in the future or something like that.

456
00:40:44,234 --> 00:40:49,539
But the way he gave it to him was actually pretty
earnest, which surprised me considering how

457
00:40:49,659 --> 00:40:54,924
he was kind of a big douchebag to his son. Yeah,
I think it was meant to be funny. I actually

458
00:40:54,944 --> 00:40:59,608
think the show gets funnier as it goes. These
first few episodes I didn't think were that

459
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:03,391
great. Yeah, it was kind of weird the way he
just kind of gave it to him. I will say the

460
00:41:03,431 --> 00:41:08,739
funniest part of this episode I thought. was
actually a setup for a gag that was recurring

461
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:16,702
throughout the rest of the season when Moe Doubles
was shot. And so his conjoined twin brother

462
00:41:16,762 --> 00:41:21,544
is just like walking around with his dead brother's
head right next to him. Just like totally aloof.

463
00:41:21,584 --> 00:41:26,306
Like it's not even a big thing. Yeah, that was
hilarious. I love that. Episode two was titled

464
00:41:26,726 --> 00:41:32,008
Grand Reopening. Hell yeah. While preparing
for Noonan's grand reopening, Kite Man hires

465
00:41:32,028 --> 00:41:37,023
Darkseid's entitled goddaughter Malice. as a
server despite Glider wanting to hire Bane

466
00:41:37,063 --> 00:41:41,885
for the job. Meanwhile, Kite Man grows desperate
for Daryl to respond to his invite to the event.

467
00:41:42,405 --> 00:41:47,727
Displeased with Malice's attitude, Glider invites
Luthor, among other notable Legion members,

468
00:41:47,787 --> 00:41:53,110
to the party, unaware that Luthor is throwing
his own party to ensure Nuenans stays irrelevant.

469
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:59,292
The latter event is subsequently ruined by Malice's
cat Cheshire, who escapes and temporarily becomes

470
00:41:59,352 --> 00:42:05,130
kaiju sized after eating several civilians.
unintentionally drawing attention to Noonans.

471
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:10,272
After realizing that he should focus more on
impressing people who actually like him, Kite

472
00:42:10,292 --> 00:42:15,633
Man fires Malice, but Glider promotes her to
social media manager to make Darkseid happy

473
00:42:15,733 --> 00:42:21,935
while Bane takes a job as bouncer. Elsewhere,
a goon named Gus takes the Queen of Fables

474
00:42:21,975 --> 00:42:27,137
head in as his kindergartner's class pet where
she is forced to entertain his students before

475
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:32,326
stealing the body of one boy's mother after
being taken home. Now, I didn't know who Malice

476
00:42:32,366 --> 00:42:37,849
was when watching the show, so I wanted to make
sure that I looked her up and she looks nothing

477
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:43,112
like her adaptation in the show. Yes, another
one of those instances of the Quinnverse really

478
00:42:43,152 --> 00:42:48,576
doing a decent job of adapting the character
from the comics. In the comics, Malice is much

479
00:42:48,636 --> 00:42:52,818
more like Baby Doll or Alice, and I think that
would have just been way too much if they had

480
00:42:52,858 --> 00:42:56,660
done that with her character. I really like
what they did with Malice. Who is she related

481
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:03,392
to on Apocalypse? I have no idea who that is.
Okay. Yeah, he's like this Monocle general

482
00:43:03,432 --> 00:43:10,136
type guy, kind of like Baron Shucker in Marvel.
Oh. Moving on to episode three titled, Villigans.

483
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:15,760
Hell yeah. Villigans, a themed chain restaurant
opens across the street from the bar, threatening

484
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:21,384
Newton's business. Meanwhile, Kite Man feels
that he is not moving fast enough in his relationship

485
00:43:21,404 --> 00:43:26,434
with Glider and asks if they can move in together.
though she avoids the subject upon noticing

486
00:43:26,474 --> 00:43:31,156
that he found her secret relationship spreadsheet
on her computer. Kite Man tries to reignite

487
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:36,438
their bond by discovering Villigan's intentions,
but proves reluctant to kill the manager as

488
00:43:36,478 --> 00:43:42,221
he has never killed before. Meanwhile, Glider
accepts Villigan's offer for a free spa day

489
00:43:42,501 --> 00:43:47,283
with the Queen and Malice. During this, she
confesses that she loves Kite Man and has been

490
00:43:47,323 --> 00:43:51,985
ready to move in with him, but is afraid that
she might kill him due to her unstable powers.

491
00:43:52,465 --> 00:43:58,403
The group later learn they stumbled onto a deathtrap
owned by Babydoll, who reveals her intent to

492
00:43:58,443 --> 00:44:04,104
kill Kite Man and destroy Nunes with a rigged
gift basket. However, Kite Man throws the basket

493
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:09,486
at the last second, destroying Villigans. Kite
Man and Glider later reconcile and agree to

494
00:44:09,526 --> 00:44:15,928
move in together. I thought one of the best
gags in the entire season was how Bane started

495
00:44:15,968 --> 00:44:22,009
working for Villigans just by going there and
seeing how poor of a service the costumed Bane

496
00:44:22,049 --> 00:44:30,789
there was giving. You're giving Bane a bad name.
He always finds himself in like the most embarrassing

497
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:36,571
situations, but he just has like the best heart
about it. So he just kind of always has to

498
00:44:37,091 --> 00:44:41,733
deal with whatever is thrown at him. He's a
great character. Episode four was titled Portal

499
00:44:41,753 --> 00:44:47,536
Potty. Hell, yeah. While moving above Noonan's,
Kiteman notices the lack of photos from Glider's

500
00:44:47,576 --> 00:44:53,086
youth, but she refuses to discuss her background
with him. Meanwhile, Bane accidentally travels

501
00:44:53,106 --> 00:44:58,949
back to 1986 after defecating in the apartment's
toilet, where he falls in love with Glider's

502
00:44:59,009 --> 00:45:04,632
mother, Rebecca Chen. Through Glider's brother,
Captain Cold, Kite Man learns their alcoholic,

503
00:45:04,692 --> 00:45:10,275
bickering parents frequented Newnans in 1986,
which is where Glider accidentally killed them

504
00:45:10,356 --> 00:45:15,038
upon using her powers for the first time. After
falling out with Glider, Kite Man travels back

505
00:45:15,058 --> 00:45:22,410
in time to prevent her parents' deaths, with
Glider following soon after. Glider's father,

506
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:27,475
Lawrence Snart, is killed in an explosion. Glider
ultimately decides to focus on the present

507
00:45:27,535 --> 00:45:33,220
instead of the past, only to discover that Rebecca
is still not around in the present. Unbeknownst

508
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:38,405
to Glider, Rebecca ran away following Lawrence's
death before being trapped in a jail cell and

509
00:45:38,425 --> 00:45:44,611
gassed by an unknown figure. A few questions
here. Who is Rebecca? Because she was very

510
00:45:44,671 --> 00:45:48,838
prominent this season and I don't know if she's
from the comics at all. She's actually not

511
00:45:48,898 --> 00:45:54,100
a major character in the comics. If anything,
the Snart Father is more of a major character

512
00:45:54,141 --> 00:45:59,143
for his involvement in the origin of Captain
Cold. Well, by the end of the show, Rebecca

513
00:45:59,203 --> 00:46:04,286
became like the evil queen in Fairy Tail Land
or something like that. Yeah, they made her

514
00:46:04,326 --> 00:46:09,988
an evil fairy godmother, but like, that's not
really a character in DC. So I'm not sure what

515
00:46:10,008 --> 00:46:14,910
that's gonna lead to. How did you feel about...
the year that they went back to being 1986,

516
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:21,752
because that would mean that Kite Man and Glider
were around their mid 40s by this point in

517
00:46:21,772 --> 00:46:26,593
the present day. Doesn't that seem a little
bit old for them? They definitely look younger

518
00:46:26,613 --> 00:46:32,535
than that, I would say. Just makes me feel like
I need to get my ass to the gym. Yeah, I know.

519
00:46:32,555 --> 00:46:36,976
I'm starting to think that my potential superhero
days are over. But, you know, not if Golden

520
00:46:36,996 --> 00:46:43,346
Glider's over here kicking ass at age 44. Right?
On ice skates, it's wild. Episode 5 was titled

521
00:46:43,546 --> 00:46:48,367
Prison Break. Hell yeah. After returning to
the present, Bane learns Rebecca was imprisoned

522
00:46:48,447 --> 00:46:53,989
in his old home, The Pit. He, Kite Man, and
Glider head there, where they discover Villigan's

523
00:46:54,109 --> 00:46:59,050
owner, Helen Villigan, purchased the pit from
the League of Shadows, and is using brainwashed

524
00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:04,912
prisoners as slave labor. Braving the workers
and various death traps, the trio rescue Rebecca

525
00:47:05,012 --> 00:47:10,713
and bring her back safely. When she awakens
later, however, Rebecca is not enthused to

526
00:47:10,753 --> 00:47:16,276
see Glider. Meanwhile, Malice closes Nounen's
early to prepare for the arrival of her immortal

527
00:47:16,336 --> 00:47:21,219
boyfriend, despite the presence of a health
inspector. She asks everyone present to pretend

528
00:47:21,259 --> 00:47:25,922
she does not work there, but the boyfriend kills
several patrons, leading to her telling the

529
00:47:25,962 --> 00:47:31,146
truth and him dumping her. This causes her to
feel emotions for the first time. Through her

530
00:47:31,246 --> 00:47:37,409
actions, Nounen's receives a D- from the inspector,
narrowly saving it from being closed down.

531
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:41,975
I'm kind of mixed on this episode. I really
liked the stuff. I thought that was hilarious,

532
00:47:42,075 --> 00:47:46,836
mainly because, you know, Bane played a big
part of it and Bane is just fantastic. I hated

533
00:47:46,936 --> 00:47:51,498
the whole Malice's boyfriend stuff and the health
inspector stuff. It was it was dumb. Like,

534
00:47:51,638 --> 00:47:56,959
why was the health inspector immortal? It was
just out of nowhere. It was filler, of course.

535
00:47:57,379 --> 00:48:03,341
I want to talk about I want to go back to Glider's
mom, Glider's mom, Rebecca, because a big portion

536
00:48:03,361 --> 00:48:07,659
of the plot revolves around her. And we know
she didn't want to be a mom, that was her whole

537
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:12,803
thing, but we never really got a sense of why
she didn't want to be a mom and how that affected

538
00:48:12,903 --> 00:48:18,347
Glider. There was no real closure there in terms
of that revelation and Glider's feelings on

539
00:48:18,387 --> 00:48:23,350
it. Well, sort of. She told Glider straight
up that she never wanted to be a mom. But you

540
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:27,113
think there would be more of an emotional fallout
from that. They kind of just moved past it

541
00:48:27,153 --> 00:48:31,897
right away. That's fair. I think I would be
much more emotionally distraught if my mother

542
00:48:31,937 --> 00:48:37,203
told me that. But... You know, Rebecca was largely
out of the picture during that portion of this

543
00:48:37,223 --> 00:48:42,866
season to begin with, so it didn't really bother
me that much. It was a non-satisfying side

544
00:48:42,906 --> 00:48:49,008
story, for sure. I would agree with that, yeah.
Episode 6 is titled Mother Daughter Day. Hell

545
00:48:49,028 --> 00:48:54,391
yeah. Glider attempts to reconcile with Rebecca
via a mother daughter day, with Malice tagging

546
00:48:54,451 --> 00:49:00,033
along at Rebecca's insistence. Before leaving,
Rebecca tells Kite Man that he is not right

547
00:49:00,053 --> 00:49:05,525
for her daughter, given his lack of prospects
and powers, which gets to him. Rebecca later

548
00:49:05,605 --> 00:49:10,528
abandons Glider, confessing that she never wanted
a child and left because she did not want to

549
00:49:10,548 --> 00:49:16,192
be killed by Glider's powers like Lawrence.
Angered, Glider tricks her into using the portal

550
00:49:16,232 --> 00:49:23,318
potty to travel back to 1986. Meanwhile, despite
his crush on Rebecca, Bane reunites with Betty,

551
00:49:23,478 --> 00:49:28,741
an old fling from Valentine's Day who convinces
him to give the relationship another chance.

552
00:49:29,134 --> 00:49:34,497
Concurrently, at the suggestion of Noonan's
former owner, Sean Noonan, Kite Man separately

553
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:40,601
meets with Etchigan and Helen to get superpowers,
but is told by her that he must give up his

554
00:49:40,641 --> 00:49:46,906
kite in exchange. He agrees and becomes Beast
Mode, gaining the ability to telekinetically

555
00:49:46,986 --> 00:49:53,110
bully others, which costs him his relationship
with Glider. Satisfied that her plan is working,

556
00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:55,411
Helen burns his old kite.

557
00:49:58,882 --> 00:50:04,704
kind of switched to the side of Kite Man. We
see her throw the kite into the fire and she's

558
00:50:04,744 --> 00:50:09,406
laughing, but we never see her pull it out of
the fire when she gives the kite back to him

559
00:50:09,446 --> 00:50:15,428
later on in the season. It feels kind of cheap
that we never saw that transformation. It kind

560
00:50:15,448 --> 00:50:18,990
of seems like the writers wrote themselves into
a corner and they didn't really know what to

561
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:23,472
do with the Helen Villigan character, so they
kind of just switched up her motivations a

562
00:50:23,512 --> 00:50:28,013
little bit in order to make Darkseid the big
bad guy. Right. Yeah, yeah, it does feel that

563
00:50:28,033 --> 00:50:32,863
way. I wonder why he had to give up the kite
to get the douchebag powers though. In a way

564
00:50:32,883 --> 00:50:37,464
it was almost kind of like giving up his soul.
He loved kites ever since he was a young kid,

565
00:50:37,904 --> 00:50:42,946
so for him to give up the things that he loves
as a way to gain powers, he was essentially

566
00:50:42,986 --> 00:50:47,167
making a deal with the devil. Right, but why
did Helen need him to get rid of the kite?

567
00:50:47,207 --> 00:50:51,748
It was like she was just fucking with him. Because
she knew it was the way that he was traditionally

568
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:56,678
most effective, and for the purposes that she
needed him for, he didn't need the kite. I

569
00:50:56,698 --> 00:51:01,561
was really glad to see Etrigan and Betty from
the Valentine's Day special. I totally forgot

570
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:06,224
about them, so that was a nice reminder. I wish
Etrigan made more appearances. Betty and Bane

571
00:51:06,424 --> 00:51:10,347
are meant to be together. I don't know what
he's doing around with this Rebecca girl. Right?

572
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:16,591
That's what I'm saying. Episode 7 was titled
Sexiest Villain Alive. Hell yeah! With Bane,

573
00:51:16,631 --> 00:51:21,915
Luther, and Beast mode in the running for Sexiest
Villain Alive, Malice upgrades Bane's wardrobe

574
00:51:21,935 --> 00:51:29,159
to increase his chances. containing the anti-life
equation that she found in Nunegan's freezer,

575
00:51:29,439 --> 00:51:34,561
which she thinks is an accessory. Meanwhile,
Glider deduces that Helen can change Beast

576
00:51:34,621 --> 00:51:39,303
Mode back into Kite Man, so she nabs Helen's
power controller with the help of Clayface,

577
00:51:39,663 --> 00:51:44,986
but only the real Helen's eyes can bypass the
security. At the awards ceremony, the Queen

578
00:51:45,086 --> 00:51:50,468
and Moe bring Toyman and Insect Queen as dates,
with the latter luring Moe back to her hive

579
00:51:50,508 --> 00:51:55,439
to kill him. The Queen and Toyman follow to
warn him, only to stumble across the Queen's

580
00:51:55,559 --> 00:52:01,444
old body preserved in honey. Helen has the contest
rigged in Beast Mode's favor, ordering him

581
00:52:01,464 --> 00:52:06,769
to distract Luther with his insulting victory
speech while her Hummingbird drones hunt down

582
00:52:06,809 --> 00:52:12,133
the equation, which Luther has also located.
The briefcase eventually lands in the possession

583
00:52:12,193 --> 00:52:17,858
of Glider, who merges with the equation and
finally gains control of her powers. She forces

584
00:52:17,878 --> 00:52:22,931
Helen to let her access the power controller,
restoring Kite Man, and the two mend their

585
00:52:22,971 --> 00:52:27,815
relationship. I guess I want to know how Helen
knew about the anti-life equation, because

586
00:52:27,835 --> 00:52:31,598
that kind of seemed to come out of nowhere,
where suddenly all these villain characters

587
00:52:31,638 --> 00:52:35,421
are going after the same thing. Dude, Helen
knows about everything in the same way that

588
00:52:35,521 --> 00:52:41,547
Google does. Or Jeff Bezos. Right, yeah. My
favorite moment in this episode, I think, was

589
00:52:41,647 --> 00:52:46,751
when the Queen of Fables asked Toy Man if he
had a car, and he was like, sort of, and then

590
00:52:46,811 --> 00:52:51,439
the next thing we see him like carrying her
head in a wagon. I don't know why. I thought

591
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:55,482
that was hilarious. I was kind of sad that we
didn't see a battle between Queen of Fables

592
00:52:55,722 --> 00:53:00,686
in her new body and the Hive Queen. It was just
mentioned as something that happened off screen.

593
00:53:01,147 --> 00:53:06,571
They should have shown that. Yeah, that was
weird. I love how enamored Kite Man's dad is

594
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:12,376
with this new version of him as Beast Mode.
Yeah, it was funny when the dad was like, let's

595
00:53:12,396 --> 00:53:17,200
go to a titty bar, son. And Beast Mode was like,
I am the titty bar. And his dad was like, I

596
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,301
don't know what that means, but I've never been
more proud.

597
00:53:22,447 --> 00:53:28,431
Everything was beast mode, I don't know why,
I just loved it. Episode 8 was titled, Just

598
00:53:28,571 --> 00:53:33,614
Right. Hell yeah. Kite Man and Glider are on
the run after obtaining the Anti-Life Equation

599
00:53:33,955 --> 00:53:38,838
and are allowed to hide out for one night at
a resort owned by Frank the Plant. Given his

600
00:53:38,898 --> 00:53:43,361
recent experience with a superpower, Kite Man
is concerned that the equation is corrupting

601
00:53:43,381 --> 00:53:48,745
his girlfriend and wants to get rid of it, especially
after she attacks random civilians out of paranoia

602
00:53:48,865 --> 00:53:53,937
and insecurity. Glider is faced with visions
of Rebecca, who suggests that they can rule

603
00:53:53,977 --> 00:53:59,122
the world together now that she has control
over her powers. Meanwhile, Bane is tasked

604
00:53:59,162 --> 00:54:04,347
with babysitting and escaped Goldilocks while
the Queen is out enjoying her old body, though

605
00:54:04,387 --> 00:54:09,772
Goldilocks' personality gets on everyone's nerves.
Bane takes Goldilocks to a meeting between

606
00:54:09,812 --> 00:54:14,317
him, Lex Luthor, and Helen Villigan, who have
temporarily joined forces to track down the

607
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:19,103
equation. Though Goldilocks ruins their talk,
Bane decides that he should learn from her

608
00:54:19,143 --> 00:54:23,924
high standards and leaves, though the equation's
location is outed thanks to a call from Frank.

609
00:54:24,224 --> 00:54:29,145
Helen sends an army of robots to get the equation
back, though at Kite Man's insistence, Gleider

610
00:54:29,185 --> 00:54:34,907
tosses it into a nearby nuclear plant, destroying
the robots as well as the resort and restoring

611
00:54:34,927 --> 00:54:40,588
Gleider's personality. Ultimately, however,
the equation remains intact even after the

612
00:54:40,628 --> 00:54:46,459
explosion. I loved the dynamic between Bane
and Goldilocks. Like if they made a Bane show,

613
00:54:46,539 --> 00:54:51,983
I would want Goldilocks to be like his sidekick.
Or at least a recurring character from time

614
00:54:52,023 --> 00:54:56,986
to time of someone that he's supposed to take
care of. Episode 9 was titled, To Get to the

615
00:54:57,086 --> 00:55:02,390
Other Side. Hell yeah. To keep the anti-life
equation from Golden Glider, Luther, and Villigan,

616
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:07,314
Kite Man steals a chicken delivery truck and
keeps the briefcase in the back, which mutates

617
00:55:07,354 --> 00:55:13,106
one of the chickens into a kaiju-sized carnivore.
Meanwhile, Malice is visited by Darkseid. who

618
00:55:13,186 --> 00:55:18,067
offers to let her serve him an apocalypse for
her dedication at Nuenen's, though she is conflicted

619
00:55:18,107 --> 00:55:23,408
about the proposal. When Sixpack lets slip that
Kite Man and Glider have the equation, she

620
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:27,870
tells him that Luther actually has it, which
adds to her guilt. Darkseid learns that he

621
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:33,311
was misled and sets out to find the equation
himself, unaware that Luther plans to recapture

622
00:55:33,351 --> 00:55:38,873
it by holding Nuenen at gunpoint to lure Kite
Man back home. His attempt is thwarted by the

623
00:55:38,913 --> 00:55:44,504
rest of the bar gang, including Bane. who unknowingly
sends Goldilocks to the portal potty to shield

624
00:55:44,544 --> 00:55:49,688
her from the violence. After Cheshire fails
to subdue the giant chicken, Glider and Kite-Man

625
00:55:49,728 --> 00:55:55,613
defeat it by making it cough up the briefcase,
dying to keep holding onto it. Back on Apocalypse,

626
00:55:56,074 --> 00:56:01,118
Darkseid, determined to complete his search
for the equation, decides to confront Malice

627
00:56:01,138 --> 00:56:06,082
about the truth using a tracking app that came
with Cheshire. I didn't love this episode.

628
00:56:06,502 --> 00:56:11,562
The chicken largely felt like filler. Absolutely.
And I don't know if the... payoff was quite

629
00:56:11,582 --> 00:56:16,783
there. No, it was definitely just, you know,
a stall tactic to get through another episode

630
00:56:16,903 --> 00:56:21,664
for them to go right back to Noonan's. I also
thought the whole thing with them being on

631
00:56:21,705 --> 00:56:26,226
the run just felt like filler. We haven't really
talked about the look of the equation yet.

632
00:56:26,286 --> 00:56:30,867
I love that they made it like the Pulp Fiction
briefcase. Whenever I watch Pulp Fiction now,

633
00:56:31,127 --> 00:56:35,368
yeah, I'm just going to think that, oh, that's
the anti-life equation. Yeah, that's my headcanon

634
00:56:35,388 --> 00:56:41,542
now. Moving on to the final episode titled Hero
Stuff. Hell yeah. Helen captures Kite Man and

635
00:56:41,562 --> 00:56:46,363
Glider and informs the couple that according
to her algorithm, the world population would

636
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:52,025
be fully destroyed no matter who handles the
anti-life equation except for Kite Man. They

637
00:56:52,045 --> 00:56:56,846
are then spared since Helen wants their help
to keep her existing business. The couple hold

638
00:56:56,886 --> 00:57:01,788
a meeting with those in Nuenens and decide that
Kite Man should commit suicide after absorbing

639
00:57:01,828 --> 00:57:07,569
the equation like the Exorcist and Glider would
be the Mercy Killer. As they get ready on the

640
00:57:07,629 --> 00:57:12,068
roof of Nuenens, Lex Luthor tracks down the
couple and arrives with the Legion of Doom.

641
00:57:12,388 --> 00:57:16,951
Their friends defend them from the attack until
Darkseid shows up after learning Kiteman's

642
00:57:16,991 --> 00:57:23,275
plan for Malice. Darkseid almost takes the equation,
but Helen's robots and Glider delay him until

643
00:57:23,335 --> 00:57:28,639
Rebecca, who traveled back to the present upon
hearing stories from Goldilocks, grabs the

644
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:33,722
equation and jumps inside the Queen of Fairy
Tales book. The book is then taken far away

645
00:57:33,762 --> 00:57:39,370
by Martian Manhunter, who has been disguised
as Gus since the group meeting. Lex retreats

646
00:57:39,530 --> 00:57:44,791
sadly while Darkseid and Helen make peace with
Nuenen's group. As Kite Man and Glider enjoy

647
00:57:44,811 --> 00:57:49,913
the blue skies ahead, Rebecca has killed off
the current evil fairy godmother and becomes

648
00:57:49,953 --> 00:57:55,534
the new evil fairy godmother with the anti-life
equation. As she prepares for a future invasion

649
00:57:55,854 --> 00:58:02,056
with the demonized storybook characters, Brainiac's
skullship approaches Earth from outer space.

650
00:58:02,136 --> 00:58:07,530
And now I'm wondering if they're gonna address
Brainiac's arrival on Earth in the Harley or

651
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:11,452
if they're just gonna completely ignore it.
Yeah, is that a set up for season two of Kite

652
00:58:11,472 --> 00:58:17,555
Man or is that set up for season five of Harley
Quinn? Not sure. I loved all the references

653
00:58:17,675 --> 00:58:21,918
to The Exorcist. Like it came up so much more
than I thought it would, which is a spoiler

654
00:58:21,938 --> 00:58:25,740
for The Exorcist for anyone who hasn't seen
it, by the way. I like how they turned it into

655
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:31,704
a verb where to exorcist yourself means to get
possessed by something and then kill yourself

656
00:58:31,724 --> 00:58:36,210
to kill it. It's very convoluted, but it's kind
of funny the way they do it. I even love how

657
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:42,014
Darkseid knew about what happens in the movie.
Yeah. That's great. I really liked this end

658
00:58:42,034 --> 00:58:46,598
battle. I thought it was cool to see the Legion
of Doom go up against Nuenen's bar people.

659
00:58:46,838 --> 00:58:50,421
I thought it was a well planned out fight even
though it was fairly brief. I also liked this

660
00:58:50,481 --> 00:58:55,545
episode overall just as a conclusion for season
one. Again, I'm not sure how the concluding

661
00:58:55,865 --> 00:59:00,588
moments will set up future seasons, but it was
nice to see Kaiman and Glider just kind of

662
00:59:00,809 --> 00:59:05,923
sail off into the sunset. I thought it was kind
of weird how Helen Villigan all of a sudden

663
00:59:05,943 --> 00:59:10,426
had these simulation scenarios that she was
running, kind of like a Monte Carlo simulator

664
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:14,768
or something like that we use here. Yeah. But
she didn't have access to that information

665
00:59:14,808 --> 00:59:18,810
in previous episodes, so it was just kind of
convenient that they introduced that idea in

666
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:24,353
this episode. Yeah. I am almost wondering if
Lance Riddick's death kind of threw a wrench

667
00:59:24,434 --> 00:59:28,216
in everything, because he was the voice of Lex
Luthor for a majority of the series, except

668
00:59:28,236 --> 00:59:32,494
for the last two episodes. You know, I thought
that exact same thing. Because... once they

669
00:59:32,514 --> 00:59:38,601
got the new voice in there, his role seemed
substantially lessened. Oh, for sure, yeah.

670
00:59:39,441 --> 00:59:45,188
And I'll say that the new voice wasn't nearly
as good. I agree. Not bad, but yeah, it just

671
00:59:45,228 --> 00:59:50,473
wasn't the same. Noticeably so. But that does
it for the show. Overall, I had a good time

672
00:59:50,493 --> 00:59:55,582
with season one of Kite Man, you know, with
laugh out load moments. raunchy romance and

673
00:59:55,642 --> 01:00:01,545
high-flying stakes. It offered an entertaining
yet all-too-familiar look at Gotham's lovable

674
01:00:01,585 --> 01:00:07,647
losers. It didn't break ground in the same way
that I feel the Harley Quinn series does with

675
01:00:07,707 --> 01:00:12,709
its often introspective episodes. There's nothing
like that in Kite Man. I do think the show

676
01:00:12,749 --> 01:00:18,872
has promise, though not as much promise as what
the show could have been if it was something

677
01:00:18,952 --> 01:00:24,418
slightly different and slightly more unique,
I would say. I'm giving it 3 out of 5 stars,

678
01:00:24,638 --> 01:00:30,520
a fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, though I
would mostly just recommend this to fans of

679
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:34,761
the Harley Quinn show. Yeah, I would agree.
The show doesn't really hold up to the main

680
01:00:34,801 --> 01:00:39,903
Harley Quinn series, so it shouldn't be rated
as high as what we did for those reviews. We

681
01:00:39,943 --> 01:00:43,604
gave the Valentine's Day special 3 stars, and
I think this holds up with that because I enjoyed

682
01:00:43,644 --> 01:00:48,205
the Valentine's Day special for Harley Quinn.
And yeah, I think ultimately I would also recommend

683
01:00:48,225 --> 01:00:52,674
the show, but again, to certain people. but
any sort of fan of comedy I think would enjoy

684
01:00:52,714 --> 01:00:59,397
it. Are you excited for a season two? Not really,
no. I could actually take it or leave it. I

685
01:00:59,417 --> 01:01:04,059
am excited for Harley Quinn season five though.
So I think that says a lot. Yeah, yeah, I don't

686
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:07,700
think we have a release date for that yet. I
could be wrong, but I am looking forward to

687
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:14,562
that as well. But that does it for this review.

In our next episode, we will be reviewing the
only DC theatrical film to come out this year,

694
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:53,943
Joker Folly Ado. I've been looking forward to
this for a couple years now, ever since it

695
01:01:53,963 --> 01:01:59,288
was first announced. I think I might be seeing
it early at a critics screening, not sure yet.

696
01:01:59,629 --> 01:02:03,692
Either way, we'll let you know everything we
thought about it in our next episode. We want
