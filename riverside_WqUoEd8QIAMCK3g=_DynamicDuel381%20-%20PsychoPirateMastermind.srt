00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,963
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:28,884
Welcome to the dynamic duel podcast a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:34,346
the superiority between Marvel and DC By comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:34,806 --> 00:00:40,549
I'm Marvelous Joe and I'm his twin brother Johnny
DC And in this episode we are going to find

5
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:48,252
out who'd win in a fight between the grand illusionist
characters Psycho pirate and mastermind. Yes,

6
00:00:48,332 --> 00:00:54,947
psycho pirate is a JSA villain whereas mastermind
is a villain of the X-Men. Yeah, it should

7
00:00:54,987 --> 00:01:00,471
be a pretty trippy duel speculation later on
this episode. Yeah, if you guys take mushrooms,

8
00:01:00,971 --> 00:01:08,156
take them now. If you microdose, just forget
the micro part. Cause it's gonna be crazy,

9
00:01:08,196 --> 00:01:12,539
man. No, we're gonna talk about who'd win in
a fight. We're gonna plug in the character

10
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:17,074
stats, run a thousand simulations, and come
up with the definitive answer. Later on this

11
00:01:17,114 --> 00:01:20,215
episode, before that we're gonna break down
the latest comic book movie news to come out

12
00:01:20,255 --> 00:01:24,716
this past week, of which there was just one
news item, fairly low key and mostly boring.

13
00:01:25,076 --> 00:01:29,517
We learned that Jonathan and Martha can't have
been cast in the Superman film. Bias! On me

14
00:01:29,577 --> 00:01:33,238
I'm like, who cares? I'm like, who cares? Bias.
But as always, we list our segment times in

15
00:01:33,258 --> 00:01:37,159
our episode description, so feel free to check
out the show notes if you want to skip ahead

16
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:43,261

Thanks AJ9K and thanks to everyone who supports
the podcast, including executive producer Brandon

28
00:02:58,752 --> 00:03:04,942
Estregard who had his birthday this past week.
Happy birthday, Brandon! If I could get you

29
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:10,967
one gift from Marvel, I think it would be to
have the power of the puppet master, the Fantastic

30
00:03:11,007 --> 00:03:15,370
Four villain. That way you can animate all the
cool Funko pops that you have. And I would

31
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:20,434
give you the power of Toy Man, who actually
I don't think has any powers, but he has a

32
00:03:20,474 --> 00:03:26,298
lot of cool toys, just like you. Happy birthday,
man. Be sure to tune into the shows in the

33
00:03:26,358 --> 00:03:31,950
DynaMic podcast network this week, including
Max Destruction. which pits your favorite action

34
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:36,932
heroes from film and television against each
other. This week though, hosts Ken and Scotty

35
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:42,835
will be doing a review of the wrestling film,
Ready to Rumble. On the Senjou World podcast,

36
00:03:42,915 --> 00:03:47,917
host Zachary Hepburn speculates on fights between
fan favorite anime and manga characters. This

37
00:03:47,957 --> 00:03:52,899
Thursday, he's going to find out who would win
in a fight between Mahito from Jujutsu Kaisen

38
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:59,243
and Elder Toguro from Yu Hakusho. On the Console
Combat podcast, hosts John and Dean find out

39
00:03:59,283 --> 00:04:04,027
who would win in fights between popular video
game characters. In yesterday's episode, they

40
00:04:04,087 --> 00:04:08,911
reviewed season 1 of the Fallout television
series. Not listening to it because I haven't

41
00:04:08,991 --> 00:04:13,394
watched it yet, but I'm dying to. Well, I never
played the game, so I don't know if I would

42
00:04:13,414 --> 00:04:17,998
get much out of it. That doesn't bother me.
It's fine. I'll learn about the game through

43
00:04:18,018 --> 00:04:22,401
the show. Visit dynamicpodcasts.com or click
the link in our show notes to listen to all

44
00:04:22,422 --> 00:04:24,603
of the shows in the DynaMic Podcast Network.

45
00:04:27,606 --> 00:04:33,289
the Rankers podcast where you can listen to
Jonathan and I get into a full on debate over

46
00:04:33,349 --> 00:04:37,632
who is better between Marvel and DC. Now I know
what you're thinking, don't you guys do that

47
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:42,334
every week on the show? Well in the Rankers
podcast that we guested on we took a more holistic

48
00:04:42,374 --> 00:04:48,038
approach to the Marvel versus DC debate. Joseph
and I each got five minutes to explain why

49
00:04:48,078 --> 00:04:53,681
we think DC or Marvel is better and then yeah
we just argued with the guys and it was a whole

50
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:58,551
lot of fun. and yeah, be sure to check it out
this Friday, April 26th. But with that out

51
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:05,033
of the way, quick to the No Prize. A No Prize
is an award Marvel used to give out to fans.

52
00:05:05,353 --> 00:05:10,035
Our version, the Dynamic duel No Prize, is a
digital award we post on Instagram for the

53
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:15,176
person that we feel gave the best answer to
our question of the week. Last week we asked,

54
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:21,046
what film are you looking forward to more this
year? Deadpool and Wolverine? or Joker Folly-a-doo.

55
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:25,707
And this is coming off of the teaser trailer
that we got for Joker Folly-a-doo. And Jonathan

56
00:05:25,747 --> 00:05:30,969
just felt like he wanted to be a glutton for
punishment by asking this question. We got

57
00:05:31,069 --> 00:05:35,210
three honorable mentions, as well as a no prize
winner. So let's go ahead and break those down.

58
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:41,932
Our first honorable mention goes to Harrison
Fox, who said, As much as I enjoy Joker, and

59
00:05:41,952 --> 00:05:46,533
I'm looking forward to the continuation of that
story, nothing can compare to the hype of Deadpool

60
00:05:46,553 --> 00:05:51,318
and Wolverine. It's going to be the first real
bridge between the Fox universe and the MCU,

61
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:55,100
something we've been waiting almost 20 years
for. It's going to have Hugh Jackman in the

62
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,781
classic yellow costume. It's going to have the
TVA and it's going to have Deadpool. There

63
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:06,623
is nothing more exciting than all of that. No
matter how much Lady Gaga you have in your

64
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:11,724
movie. Yeah. It would take at least three times
as much Lady Gaga and Joker Folly I do to even

65
00:06:11,884 --> 00:06:16,345
come close to the level of anticipation people
are feeling for Deadpool and Wolverine this

66
00:06:16,365 --> 00:06:24,771
summer. That is a scientific fact. That is that
is a lot of Lady Gaga. I mean, I do kind of

67
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:29,234
see where he's coming from, where there's all
this hype that the X-Men are finally going

68
00:06:29,274 --> 00:06:35,738
to appear in the MCU. But, man, I'm like, we
already got our first mutant with Miss Marvel,

69
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:40,662
you know? Well, we've also seen Professor X
in the Multiverse of Madness movie, and then

70
00:06:40,682 --> 00:06:45,705
there was Beast in the Marvel's film. But this
is going to be like a whole lot more of that

71
00:06:45,945 --> 00:06:50,860
awesomeness. And those really weren't even that
awesome. They were that awesome, actually.

72
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,863
They were incredible. I cannot wait for Deadpool
and Wolverine. Great answer, Harrison Fox.

73
00:06:54,903 --> 00:07:01,187
I think you put it very well. Our next honorable
mention goes to Travis Herndon, who said, Hey,

74
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:05,991
danger dudes, Travis here. Shout out to my other
twins. So my answer would have to be Deadpool

75
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:12,395
and Wolverine. One is because Deadpool was finally
in the MCU. Two, Hugh Jackman is back playing

76
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:17,374
Wolverine. I feel like this movie is going to
be kicking ass. We're gonna be seeing some

77
00:07:17,434 --> 00:07:23,057
cool action scenes with those two. And honestly,
depending on how this movie ends, it's gonna

78
00:07:23,097 --> 00:07:29,400
be either really good or really fucking amazing.
So yeah, that's my pick. Those really are the

79
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,662
two options of how Deadpool and Wolverine can
come out. It's gonna be either really good

80
00:07:33,042 --> 00:07:37,965
or really fucking amazing, just like Travis
Herndon said. There are no other options. As

81
00:07:38,005 --> 00:07:43,370
much as I hate the idea of- Hugh Jackman coming
back to the role of Wolverine after he ended

82
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:48,152
it on a perfect note with Logan. I do have to
admit that the pairing of Ryan Reynolds and

83
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:53,933
Hugh Jackman is comedic perfection. I mean,
well, we did see it happen already in X-Men

84
00:07:53,953 --> 00:07:59,295
Origins Wolverine, but also we tried to forget
about that movie. I already did. Thanks for

85
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:04,896
reminding me. I'm sure they'll be making a reference
to that film in the Deadpool and Wolverine

86
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:10,050
movie that comes out. Great answer, Travis.
Our final honorable mention goes to... Koyen

87
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:17,016
Liao who said, Hi there, Koyen Liao speaking
here, listening from Singapore. I'd say my

88
00:08:17,176 --> 00:08:23,281
answer would be Deadpool and Wolverine because
you don't get this kind of collaboration every

89
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:30,627
year and Joker followed you is kind of stupid.
I mean the musical is kind of stupid. But yeah,

90
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:39,070
my answer would be Deadpool and Wolverine. So
yeah, that's it I think. That's it. That's

91
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,812
all that needs to be said. Joker Folly I do
is stupid. How about that, Jonathan? Well,

92
00:08:43,832 --> 00:08:49,175
I think specifically said that musicals are
stupid, which I could disagree every single

93
00:08:49,215 --> 00:08:54,818
freaking podcast episode leading up to the Joker
movie where everyone is proven wrong. But I

94
00:08:54,858 --> 00:08:59,981
understand that sentiment exists out there.
If you guys think musicals are stupid, I recommend

95
00:09:00,021 --> 00:09:05,684
checking out like Flight of the Concords or
Sweeney Todd. They're not all bad. Sweeney

96
00:09:05,724 --> 00:09:10,922
Todd wasn't that good, man. I watched that movie.
I didn't like it that much because you're stupid.

97
00:09:11,322 --> 00:09:14,843
If you want to talk about a good musical, I
thought Team America was a pretty good musical.

98
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:20,705
Oh, that's a great one. Hamilton actually was
fantastic. It's probably the best one. We really

99
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:24,126
don't get better than Hamilton. Yeah, you can't
get better than Hamilton. Yeah. Great answer,

100
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:29,827
Koyan. We want to give a quick shout out to
both JP and Josh Hayward. First time colors

101
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:36,209
who also gave the answer of Deadpool and Wolverine.
Everybody basically gave the answer of Deadpool

102
00:09:36,229 --> 00:09:42,127
and Wolverine. How could you not, right? How
could you not? Except for the winner of this

103
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:47,908
week's No Prize, who is Miggy Mathingian? He
said. Hey, what's up guys, this is Miggy, and

104
00:09:47,948 --> 00:09:54,650
I'm looking forward to Folly a Do more than
Deadpool because it's gonna be like more intelligent,

105
00:09:54,970 --> 00:10:01,412
just a better objectively better made film,
probably gonna win more awards. Yeah, I don't

106
00:10:01,432 --> 00:10:07,473
know. I'm just like as a DC fan, like just more
intelligent than like the brainwashed MCU zombies.

107
00:10:08,014 --> 00:10:13,597
You know what I'm saying? So, yeah. That's right
MCU fans, you guys are brainwashed. You guys

108
00:10:13,637 --> 00:10:18,219
need to get with the program and start watching
more intelligent films like Joker Follyadoo.

109
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,982
The only reason Miggie's answer won the question
of the week was because there was no way to

110
00:10:23,022 --> 00:10:28,605
choose between all the other answers of Deadpool
and Wolverine, of which they staggeringly outnumbered

111
00:10:28,806 --> 00:10:34,989
Miggie's answer of the Joker sequel. More people
are in fact looking forward to Deadpool and

112
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:41,045
Wolverine. And yeah, you may like, I don't know,
try to rile us up by saying we're less intelligent

113
00:10:41,065 --> 00:10:46,609
for that. But that just makes you look petty
because obviously everyone knows Deadpool and

114
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:50,952
Wolverine is going to be the better superhero
film. But I mean, do they? Like, I don't know

115
00:10:50,992 --> 00:10:55,234
that. I don't know that. And I'm more intelligent
because I'm a DC fan. Wait. So you're saying

116
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:59,617
that you don't know something and that you're
more intelligent. I think that's kind of contradictory.

117
00:11:00,018 --> 00:11:04,741
Fuck. Yeah. No, honestly, I'm really curious
to see who's going to come out on top in the

118
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:09,676
box office. because the Deadpool films have
made over a billion dollars. They're rated

119
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:15,299
R. The first Joker film is rated R, and it's
actually the highest grossing rated R film

120
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:20,101
of all time, making over a billion dollars.
So these are both billion dollar rated R franchises.

121
00:11:20,301 --> 00:11:24,243
They're both sequels. Who's gonna win the box
office? That's what I really wanna know. You

122
00:11:24,263 --> 00:11:28,686
wanna place a bet on it now? I think you've
lost every single bet that we've made. I don't

123
00:11:28,726 --> 00:11:33,809
remember that. I remember winning all of the
bets. No. All right, let's do a bet. 50 bucks

124
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:39,283
says that Joker comes out on top. 50 bucks overbending
money, not pride. Cause last time you lost

125
00:11:39,303 --> 00:11:43,544
these bets, you had to say live on air that
Batman is a piece of shit. But we'll do money.

126
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:49,447
Money's fine. I could use some money. Oh, I
don't know. Okay. No, if you lose, you have

127
00:11:49,487 --> 00:11:56,369
to say Marvel sucks ass. Okay. And if you lose,
you have to give me 50 bucks. Deal. Damn it.

128
00:11:59,214 --> 00:12:02,818
But congrats to Miggi for winning this week's
No Prize. If you the listener want a shot at

129
00:12:02,858 --> 00:12:06,664
winning your own No Prize, stay tuned till later
on this episode when we'll be asking another

130
00:12:06,764 --> 00:12:10,409
question of the week. And now that that's done,
on to the news.

131
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:20,827
Okay, so this past week, the wrap, I believe,
was the first trade to get the exclusive castings

132
00:12:21,167 --> 00:12:27,969
for Jonathan and Martha Kent, the farmer adoptive
parents of Superman in the upcoming Superman

133
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:34,871
film. Jonathan Kent is going to be played by
Pruitt Taylor Vintze, who I most know from

134
00:12:35,191 --> 00:12:41,833
Constantine. He was Constantine's priest friend.
But he's also had a recurring role on Netflix's

135
00:12:41,893 --> 00:12:47,335
Stranger Things. He was an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
He was in Heroes Reborn, True Blood, The Walking

136
00:12:47,395 --> 00:12:53,639
Dead, The Mentalist, Murder One, which he actually
won an Emmy for. The guy has a pretty robust

137
00:12:53,699 --> 00:12:58,102
filmography. Who was he in Agents of Shield?
I don't remember him. I don't know. I didn't

138
00:12:58,122 --> 00:13:03,266
watch that show. Well, why don't you look it
up on IMDb and then tell me? Hey, hey, same

139
00:13:03,286 --> 00:13:08,870
to you, pal. Same to you. You're the one asking
the question. OK, according to IMDb, he played

140
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:15,274
a character named Grill in four episodes in
season five of Agents of Shield. And I don't

141
00:13:15,314 --> 00:13:19,897
remember that character at all. I may have to
revisit that. Well, I think is fairly recognizable

142
00:13:20,077 --> 00:13:24,901
as an actor. He may not be a household name,
but I think he's a good actor. And I think

143
00:13:24,941 --> 00:13:31,365
he could definitely pull off the Kansas farmer
for sure. As can Neva Howell, who will be playing

144
00:13:31,785 --> 00:13:38,550
Martha Kent. I don't know if I've actually seen
her in anything. She was in Diary of a Wimpy

145
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:45,863
Kid, The Long Call, Logan Lucky and My Fellow
Americans. She looks a little familiar, but

146
00:13:45,983 --> 00:13:51,328
yeah, not really familiar with her at all. So
is this the most boring casting news ever?

147
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:58,994
I think so. I'm pretty bored. Are you excited?
Hell yeah, I'm excited. I think this just continues

148
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:04,038
James Gunn's streak of casting this movie perfectly.
I mean, they kind of look more the part, I

149
00:14:04,058 --> 00:14:09,834
would say, than Kevin Costner and Diane Lane.
Like those actors are very like... Model-esque

150
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:14,076
I would say whereas these guys definitely, you
know resemble more of what I imagine a Kansas

151
00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:19,359
farming couple would look like A little bit
more down-to-earth, I guess. Exactly. Sure.

152
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:23,441
And since there's nothing really left to say
about this topic, that brings us to our question

153
00:14:23,481 --> 00:14:23,861
of the week.

154
00:14:28,246 --> 00:14:33,568
What casting announcement for a Marvel or DC
film were you most hyped about when you first

155
00:14:33,588 --> 00:14:38,230
heard about it and why? Yeah, this goes back
through the history of Marvel and DC films.

156
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:41,591
What was the announcement that when you heard
it you were just like so freaking pumped to

157
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:46,593
see the movie? Because of this announcement.

163
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:18,420
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and move into

164
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,803
our main event, where we find out who'd win
in a fight between the JSA villain of Psycho

165
00:15:23,843 --> 00:15:26,785
Pirate and the X-Men villain, Mastermind.

166
00:15:41,814 --> 00:15:46,416
Alright, Psycho Pirate versus Mastermind. These
are both illusionist characters. They can make

167
00:15:46,436 --> 00:15:51,939
people see things psychically that don't actually
exist, but they're highly manipulative in that

168
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:56,922
fashion. No, well for Psycho Pirate, these things
actually do exist. They're like, they're lifelike

169
00:15:56,982 --> 00:16:03,125
duplicates. What the fuck? How is he an illusionist
then? That's like reality warping, not illusions.

170
00:16:03,426 --> 00:16:08,769
Yeah, yeah, he's a reality warper, you could
say. Well, this is a stupid match. Whose idea

171
00:16:08,789 --> 00:16:14,571
was this? Miggy's? No, actually, it was your
idea. We were trying to think of a match up

172
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:19,433
for Psycho Pirate because he's going to be featured,
it looks like pretty heavily in the upcoming

173
00:16:19,553 --> 00:16:24,815
Crisis on Infinite Earths animated film. And
you were the one who suggested Mastermind.

174
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:30,718
I think I suggested it because Psycho Pirate
has empathy powers, empathic abilities. Yes.

175
00:16:31,018 --> 00:16:36,080
And Mastermind can also elicit emotions through
the use of his illusions. And plus, to the

176
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:41,314
person experiencing the illusions, they are
real according to all of their senses. So for

177
00:16:41,354 --> 00:16:46,377
all intents and purposes, to his victims, it
almost is like mastermind is warping reality.

178
00:16:46,898 --> 00:16:51,281
So, Psycho Pirates going down, and I'm not scared.
You will be.

179
00:16:55,124 --> 00:16:59,567
Okay Yoda, can't wait to get into this duel
matchup, but to explain the methodology behind

180
00:16:59,607 --> 00:17:04,690
our duels, let's go to our sentient duel simulator,
Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ and Ayn K, tell our

181
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:09,990
listeners how you go about determining a winner
in our duel matchups. Yes, of course sir. The

182
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:14,631
way I determine a winner between the contestants
is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations

183
00:17:14,732 --> 00:17:19,614
using the characters statistics. A Monte Carlo
simulation is a probabilistic model used to

184
00:17:19,654 --> 00:17:24,776
determine outcomes through random sampling.
In this case, I randomise the statistics along

185
00:17:24,796 --> 00:17:29,278
a normal distribution as a way to simulate the
many variables that can occur during battle.

186
00:17:29,678 --> 00:17:34,420
The stat parameters are based on the official
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters

187
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,606
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat
categories are included such as range, damage

188
00:17:39,646 --> 00:17:45,047
potential, versatility and perception in order
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.

189
00:17:45,547 --> 00:17:50,349
The results of the 1000 simulations provide
a percentage of wins for each character. The

190
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:54,850
contestant with the higher percentage is declared
the victor as they have a higher probability

191
00:17:54,890 --> 00:18:00,712
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,
neither character should win 100% of the matches.

192
00:18:01,212 --> 00:18:05,698
The comic book stories have shown that there's
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman. So

193
00:18:05,738 --> 00:18:09,599
the confidence rate of my method falls in line
with the precedents that have been established

194
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:15,200
in the source material. My mathematical simulations
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are

195
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:19,622
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes
tabulated for determination of the winner.

196
00:18:21,022 --> 00:18:25,803
Thanks AJ9K! Before we run the simulations though,
we like to break down each character's histories

197
00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:31,385
and abilities before improvising a scenario
on how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations

198
00:18:31,405 --> 00:18:37,148
would play out beat for beat. And I believe
it's my turn to go first with the DC character,

199
00:18:37,488 --> 00:18:43,511
so let me tell you all about Psycho Pirate.
Now on Earth 2, an alternate reality from DC's

200
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:49,955
primary universe, a greedy, middle-aged pressman
for the Daily Courier newspaper named Charles

201
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:56,179
Halsted hated his publisher for not paying him
enough. This hatred drove Charles into orchestrating

202
00:18:56,219 --> 00:19:02,919
a series of crimes based on emotion as the costumed
villain Psycho Pirate. As Charles became successful

203
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:08,163
in his crimes, he became bolder, though after
he challenged the Justice Society of America

204
00:19:08,203 --> 00:19:14,068
to stop him, the team managed to do just that,
and Charles was put in prison. You can learn

205
00:19:14,128 --> 00:19:19,873
more about the JSA in our Justice Society vs.
Fantastic Four episode. Charles became obsessed

206
00:19:19,913 --> 00:19:25,758
with manipulating people's emotions and dabbled
in psychology and mysticism, enabling him to

207
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:32,227
escape prison several times, only to be returned
to his cell. by the JSA over the decades. By

208
00:19:32,247 --> 00:19:38,589
the mid-60s, Charles grew ill in prison, and,
wanting to pass on his secrets before death,

209
00:19:38,949 --> 00:19:44,972
taught his young cellmate Roger Hayden everything
he knew about manipulating emotions and also

210
00:19:45,032 --> 00:19:51,075
revealed the existence of the Medusa Masks,
mystic and ancient golden masks discovered

211
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:59,462
by the archaeologist Kent Nelson, aka Dr. Fate
of the JSA. The Medusa Masks portrayed emotional

212
00:19:59,522 --> 00:20:04,604
expressions that were projected onto anyone
who saw them. You can learn more about Dr.

213
00:20:04,644 --> 00:20:11,547
Fate in his duel episode with Dr. Strange. Charles
died soon after, and Roger, who had been sentenced

214
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:17,190
to a year in prison for attacking his father,
an emotionally abusive psychiatrist, was set

215
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:23,412
free. Roger was eventually able to acquire the
Medusa Masks, which he used successfully to

216
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:29,184
commit crimes as the new Psycho Pirates. It
wasn't long before Roger decided to melt and

217
00:20:29,364 --> 00:20:35,348
merge the masks into a single, all-powerful
Medusa mask, allowing him to manipulate others

218
00:20:35,408 --> 00:20:41,492
across the broad spectrum of emotions without
having to change masks. Confronted by the JSA,

219
00:20:41,852 --> 00:20:46,976
Psycho Pirate soon realized that merging the
masks had corrupted their magic, resulting

220
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:52,560
in him being able to, and needing to, feed on
others' emotions, otherwise he would succumb

221
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:58,408
to mental anguish. Thanks to Dr. Fate, The GSA
was able to imprison Psycho Pirate, who was

222
00:20:58,468 --> 00:21:03,553
later broken out of jail by the Ultrahumanite,
so that he could join a secret society of supervillains.

223
00:21:03,893 --> 00:21:09,678
Over time, Psycho Pirate was driven insane by
the pain of needing to feed on emotions, though

224
00:21:09,698 --> 00:21:15,523
he was eventually cured by the multiversal overseer
known as the Monitor, who had recruited Psycho

225
00:21:15,543 --> 00:21:20,788
Pirate and other heroes and villains to save
the multiverse from his brother, the Anti-Monitor,

226
00:21:21,128 --> 00:21:26,693
who was destroying it. The Anti-Monitor kidnapped
Psycho-Pirate, however, and after being promised

227
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:32,778
an entire world of beings whose emotions he
could toy with and drain, Psycho-Pirate manipulated

228
00:21:32,818 --> 00:21:39,364
the Monitor's champions and at one point was
able to manipulate entire universes. This proved

229
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:45,389
to be too taxing over time, however, and resulted
in Psycho-Pirate losing his powers. After the

230
00:21:45,469 --> 00:21:51,278
Anti-Monitor's defeat, the multiverse was merged
into a single universe in which Roger, was

231
00:21:51,318 --> 00:21:57,021
confined to Arkham Asylum, driven insane after
being connected to the minds of so many beings

232
00:21:57,421 --> 00:22:01,683
as well as being one of the few in existence
to remember the multiversal crisis and the

233
00:22:01,743 --> 00:22:08,387
existence of past universes. PsychoPirate eventually
escaped Arkham with help from a fifth dimensional

234
00:22:08,427 --> 00:22:13,710
genie known as a Thunderbolt, and was able to
purge his memories of the past multiverse through

235
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,851
the Thunderbolt's electroshock treatments.

236
00:22:20,758 --> 00:22:26,242
the teams of Infinity Inc and the Outsiders,
Psycho Pirate was imprisoned once again. The

237
00:22:26,282 --> 00:22:32,367
Thunderbolts therapy eventually wore off, however,
and Roger's pre-crisis memories returned. The

238
00:22:32,507 --> 00:22:37,651
strain of remembering so many lives that had
been lost caused Psycho Pirate's Medusa mask

239
00:22:37,912 --> 00:22:43,416
to manifest the fallen characters, returning
them to life. The characters eventually discovered,

240
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,398
though, that not only were they illusions created
by

241
00:22:50,582 --> 00:22:55,824
With help from Animal Man, the characters and
Psycho Pirate were put at ease and faded from

242
00:22:55,884 --> 00:23:01,666
existence. The Medusa mask, however, did not
disappear and bounced from Arkham Asylum to

243
00:23:01,686 --> 00:23:07,529
the Outsiders and the Suicide Squad. When the
Archdemon Neron unleashed the underworld on

244
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:12,731
Earth, it was revealed that Psycho Pirate had
been residing in Limbo, and he agreed to sell

245
00:23:12,751 --> 00:23:18,594
his soul to Neron in exchange for life and power.
While Neron was on Earth, The Psycho Pirate

246
00:23:18,614 --> 00:23:24,477
was able to transform the Medusa Mask into an
eye patch and remained sane. Upon Neiron's

247
00:23:24,497 --> 00:23:30,340
defeat, however, the Medusa Mask returned to
its earlier state as did Psycho Pirate's mind

248
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:36,264
over time, remembering pre-crisis events and
characters. It was the return of Psycho Pirate's

249
00:23:36,364 --> 00:23:42,067
memories that caused him to realize that he
and Power Girl, originally Earth-2's Supergirl,

250
00:23:42,427 --> 00:23:48,991
were the only two survivors of Earth-2 in the
new You can learn more about Power Girl in

251
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:55,075
our Power Girl vs Valkyrie episode. After failing
to get Power Girl to join his cause in helping

252
00:23:55,215 --> 00:24:01,499
Alexander Luther of Earth 3 to restore the multiverse,
the emotionless Black Adam straight up killed

253
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:07,664
Psycho Pirate by shoving his fingers through
his face, and the Teen Titan Raven later destroyed

254
00:24:07,744 --> 00:24:13,288
the Medusa Mask. That is until the Blackest
Night, when zombified heroes and villains returned

255
00:24:13,308 --> 00:24:18,188
from the dead to kill all life in the universe.
With the Medusa mask constructed from his black

256
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:23,892
ring, Psycho Pirate pit Superman and Superboy
against each other, though once Superboy managed

257
00:24:23,973 --> 00:24:29,477
to steal the black Medusa mask and use it against
the black lanterns, Psycho Pirate and the others

258
00:24:29,557 --> 00:24:35,723
returned to inanimate corpses. When the Flash
reset DC's continuity in a Flashpoint event,

259
00:24:36,163 --> 00:24:40,767
Roger Hayden was one of twenty humans that were
captured and experimented on by the villain

260
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:46,304
Brainiac, giving them psychic abilities. While
hunted by the Hive Queen, another member of

261
00:24:46,364 --> 00:24:51,908
the Twenty, Roger sought and fought the Medusa
Mask, which was now simply an artifact capable

262
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:58,154
of blocking out psychic attacks and manipulations
from others. After Psycho-Pirate attacked Metropolis,

263
00:24:58,534 --> 00:25:04,439
Superman destroyed the Medusa Mask, causing
Roger to flee. This was later retconned when

264
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:10,104
DC's pre- and post-Flashpoint timelines merged,
resulting in a rebirth of DC's continuity.

265
00:25:10,585 --> 00:25:15,727
The villain Bane... who you can learn more about
in our Bane vs Iron Fist episode, captured

266
00:25:15,808 --> 00:25:20,470
Psycho Pirate and forced him to use his powers
to help Bane overcome his childhood trauma

267
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:26,793
and addiction to the Venom steroid. Batman managed
to abduct Psycho Pirate and kept his Medusa

268
00:25:26,813 --> 00:25:31,695
mask in the Batcave, where it later brought
back to life old characters that had not yet

269
00:25:31,795 --> 00:25:37,078
been reintroduced to continuity, such as Jay
Garrick the Flash. as well as characters from

270
00:25:37,158 --> 00:25:43,461
alternate universes such as the Flashpoint Thomas
Wayne version of Batman. Now powers-wise, Psycho

271
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:49,423
Pirate is typically shown as having no natural
superhuman abilities other than a master understanding

272
00:25:49,483 --> 00:25:55,786
of human emotion and manipulation. When donning
the Medusa Mask, Psycho Pirate is able to project

273
00:25:55,846 --> 00:26:02,628
emotions onto others, often by magically manifesting
objects or beings that cause a person to feel

274
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:08,711
a specific emotion. For example, If you wanted
to instill fear in you, Joseph, he'd create

275
00:26:08,951 --> 00:26:14,193
a spider on the wall right behind you! Okay,
didn't work! Or if you wanted to instill joy

276
00:26:14,253 --> 00:26:20,716
in me, he'd create a spider on the wall right
behind you! Damn it! Maybe don't have a big

277
00:26:20,836 --> 00:26:26,959
smile on your face when you're saying this,
because then it's not believable. Fuck! Now

278
00:26:26,979 --> 00:26:31,801
the Medusa Mask can also create characters from
universes or timelines that have been destroyed.

279
00:26:32,222 --> 00:26:37,023
It can create illusions that can disguise Psycho
Pirate or create false duplicates of himself.

280
00:26:37,543 --> 00:26:42,465
He does have several weaknesses, however. One
being that he's insane, and the other that

281
00:26:42,525 --> 00:26:48,447
he begins to feel psychic pain if he's not around
others with emotions. That's Psycho Pirate.

282
00:26:48,867 --> 00:26:53,968
So the purpose of his illusions are more to
elicit a certain fear, as opposed to like a

283
00:26:54,028 --> 00:26:59,806
broad illusion casting ability that has nothing
to do with empathy. Oh, it's not specific to

284
00:26:59,846 --> 00:27:05,749
fear. He's not a mind reader and he can't quite
control the things that are created. It's more

285
00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:10,892
about the other person manifesting things that
would make them feel an emotion that he wants

286
00:27:10,912 --> 00:27:16,614
them to feel. Wait, so it's the victim that's
manifesting the illusion. So the mask has some

287
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:21,817
kind of psychic ability that can read the victim's
mind. Exactly. Kind of like Mirage. Yeah. Yeah,

288
00:27:21,937 --> 00:27:26,351
actually just like that. Yeah, Mirage doesn't
necessarily know what illusion she's going

289
00:27:26,391 --> 00:27:31,634
to create. She just has the ability to manifest
an illusion of the victim's greatest fear.

290
00:27:32,294 --> 00:27:36,596
You can learn more about Mirage in our Arrowette
versus Mirage Duel episode. But it sounds like

291
00:27:36,636 --> 00:27:41,499
those two characters are kind of similar. Yeah,
yeah, you could say that. And to be fair, Mastermind

292
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:46,001
is also very similar. So that's good. Let me
go ahead and get into his backstory and tell

293
00:27:46,021 --> 00:27:51,165
you all about him. Little is known about the
early life of Jason Wingard, as it's believed

294
00:27:51,205 --> 00:27:56,969
that name is as false as the man himself. Prior
to being discovered by Magneto working as a

295
00:27:57,029 --> 00:28:02,113
carnival mentalist, all that was known of the
man named Jason was that he lived a life of

296
00:28:02,153 --> 00:28:06,877
deception through his mutant ability to cast
telepathic illusions that causes victims to

297
00:28:06,897 --> 00:28:11,841
see whatever he wished them to see. Spurred
by malice and hatred, plus his desire to be

298
00:28:11,861 --> 00:28:16,815
with the Scarlet Witch, Jason joined Magneto's
Brotherhood of Mutants team and their goal

299
00:28:16,915 --> 00:28:21,757
of mutant superiority through the subjugation
of humanity. He proved instrumental in the

300
00:28:21,797 --> 00:28:26,799
Brotherhood's first mission when they captured
the entire South American nation of Santo Marco,

301
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:31,961
with help from Jason's illusion that they had
thousands of soldiers on their side. It was

302
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:37,423
there that the Brotherhood first clashed with
the X-Men, a team of mutant heroes who opposed

303
00:28:37,483 --> 00:28:42,765
Magneto's agenda. You can learn more about the
X-Men in our Titans vs X-Men Team Duel episode.

304
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:47,651
and more about the Brotherhood in their duel
against the Rogues. The Brotherhood and X-Men

305
00:28:47,671 --> 00:28:52,312
would repeatedly clash over the years, and Mastermind
would employ such illusions against them as

306
00:28:52,412 --> 00:28:56,753
flames, duplicates of himself, or he would just
use his trusty handgun that he always carried

307
00:28:56,793 --> 00:29:01,295
with him. The Brotherhood was often defeated,
however, and the frustrated Jason joined a

308
00:29:01,475 --> 00:29:07,056
new group of mutants bent on world domination
called Factor III, alongside other X-Men enemies

309
00:29:07,176 --> 00:29:13,134
as the Blob, Vanisher, Eunice the Untouchable,
and Changeling. They planned to instigate a

310
00:29:13,215 --> 00:29:17,558
nuclear war between the United States and Russia,
however when it was revealed that the team

311
00:29:17,598 --> 00:29:23,342
leader Mutant Master was an extraterrestrial,
Factor 3 and the X-Men united to defeat him.

312
00:29:23,783 --> 00:29:29,167
At one point, Mastermind teamed up with the
Sentry villain known as the General to implant

313
00:29:29,207 --> 00:29:34,451
the illusion in the hero's mind that he should
no longer use his powers. You can learn more

314
00:29:34,491 --> 00:29:39,438
about the Sentry in our duel episode where we
pit him against Zod. Later, a secret group

315
00:29:39,478 --> 00:29:44,839
of influential mutants called the Hellfire Club
invited Jason to join their inner circle, seeing

316
00:29:44,859 --> 00:29:50,021
his power set as a valuable asset for their
agenda to amass greater wealth and power. You

317
00:29:50,041 --> 00:29:54,182
can learn more about the Hellfire Club and their
tradition of codenaming their highest ranking

318
00:29:54,222 --> 00:30:00,564
members as chess pieces in our Poison Ivy vs
White Queen Emma Frost duel episode. To prove

319
00:30:00,604 --> 00:30:06,054
his worth to the Hellfire Club, Jason set out
to manipulate the X-Men member Jane and turn

320
00:30:06,094 --> 00:30:11,855
her into the Inner Circle's Black Queen. He
wasn't aware, however, that at that time, Jean

321
00:30:11,875 --> 00:30:17,257
Grey was actually a manifestation of the cosmic
entity called the Phoenix Force, who had taken

322
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:23,279
on the appearance of Jean in order to experience
new sensations. Jason exploited her mind into

323
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:28,600
joining the Hellfire Club, though the X-Men
leader Cyclops tried to intervene. When Jason

324
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:34,526
cast an illusion to the Phoenix Force that he
killed Cyclops, whom she loved, he inadvertently

325
00:30:34,646 --> 00:30:39,370
unleashed her fury and transformed her into
the Dark Phoenix, which you can learn more

326
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:44,754
about in our Raven versus Phoenix episode. In
retaliation for Jason's manipulation, the Phoenix

327
00:30:44,794 --> 00:30:50,418
Force opened his mind for a moment to the vastness
of the universe, driving him insane. He was

328
00:30:50,478 --> 00:30:55,061
rejected from the Hellfire Club and taken to
Bellevue Hospital for psychiatric recovery.

329
00:30:55,861 --> 00:31:00,545
Upon being released several years later, he
set about getting revenge on the Inner Circle

330
00:31:00,805 --> 00:31:06,383
and the X-Men. He attacked Emma Frost, putting
her into a coma. He created a rift between

331
00:31:06,443 --> 00:31:11,845
Rogue and her adoptive mother Mystique. And
he got Wolverine's fiancee, Mariko Yashida,

332
00:31:12,005 --> 00:31:17,807
to call off their wedding. Finally, he convinced
the X-Men that Cyclops' new fiance, Madeline

333
00:31:17,847 --> 00:31:23,829
Pryor, was the Dark Phoenix, hoping to get them
to kill her. However, Cyclops discovered Jason's

334
00:31:23,869 --> 00:31:29,392
deception, and the X-Men defeated him. Eventually,
Jason discovered he had contracted the Legacy

335
00:31:29,432 --> 00:31:34,175
Virus, a disease lethal to mutants that was
unleashed by Cable's clone from the future

336
00:31:34,355 --> 00:31:39,519
named Strife. Jason's legacy was carried on,
however, by several of his estranged daughters,

337
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:45,903
two of whom inherited his illusion casting abilities
and took his codename of Mastermind. His first

338
00:31:45,963 --> 00:31:51,307
daughter, Martinique Wingard, was hired by the
villain Arcade to frame Wolverine for the murder

339
00:31:51,347 --> 00:31:56,238
of several women in London. She turned on Arcade,
however, whom you can learn more about in our

340
00:31:56,258 --> 00:32:01,642
Riddler vs Arcade duel, and later joined Mystique's
Brotherhood of Mutants team. Martinique was

341
00:32:01,682 --> 00:32:07,186
eventually incarcerated and forced to join a
new team called X-Core, led by the former X-Men

342
00:32:07,206 --> 00:32:12,490
member Banshee, who felt the best approach to
achieve Professor X's dream of peaceful coexistence

343
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:17,133
between humans and mutants was to have a mutant
police force to regulate the activities of

344
00:32:17,213 --> 00:32:22,176
other mutants. However, it was revealed that
Banshee was using Martinique's illusion casting

345
00:32:22,216 --> 00:32:27,280
powers to placate the more villainous quote
unquote reformed members of the team. After

346
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:32,623
the revelation of this news, the X-Core was
disbanded. Jason's other daughter and Martinique's

347
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:38,487
half-sister was named Regenwingard. She was
hired by Sebastian Shaw, the Black King of

348
00:32:38,507 --> 00:32:44,131
the Hellfire Club, to manipulate the mutant
Sage into betraying the X-Win and compelling

349
00:32:44,231 --> 00:32:49,338
Rogue to attack her teammates by making her
see them as someone else. Eventually her illusions

350
00:32:49,378 --> 00:32:53,820
were turned back on Regan, leaving her in a
vegetative state. She was taken in and cared

351
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:59,322
for by the X-Men, and when she recovered, she
ended up joining the team for a time. However,

352
00:32:59,362 --> 00:33:03,684
it turned out to all be a ruse in coordination
with the villains Mr. Sinister and Mystique,

353
00:33:04,004 --> 00:33:07,746
and Regan revealed a team of mutant villains
that she had been concealing this whole time

354
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:13,128
called the Marauders, who went on to attack
and capture some of the X-Men heroes. The X-Men

355
00:33:13,168 --> 00:33:17,570
later fought back against Mr. Sinister, and
Wolverine stabbed Regan. taking her out of

356
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:22,394
commission for a time. You can learn more about
Mr. Sinister in his duel against the Ultra-Humanite.

357
00:33:22,855 --> 00:33:28,499
Eventually, both sisters, Martinique and Regan,
joined the Sisterhood of Mutants, led by Jean

358
00:33:28,519 --> 00:33:34,224
Grey's clone and Cyclops' former fiancee, Madeleine
Pryor, who was after Jean Grey's DNA in order

359
00:33:34,264 --> 00:33:39,028
to form herself a new body. Though the team
was unsuccessful, the sisters soon learned

360
00:33:39,068 --> 00:33:44,793
that Jason had another daughter named Pixie,
who had wings and could emit hallucinogenic

361
00:33:44,893 --> 00:33:50,436
dust. The three sisters worked together to defeat
a horde of demons and then parted ways, with

362
00:33:50,496 --> 00:33:56,920
Pixie remaining with the X-Men. Afterward, Regan
ended up contracting MPOX, which was another

363
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,782
disease that mutants were susceptible to after
the release of the Terrigan Mists in the Earth's

364
00:34:01,862 --> 00:34:06,605
atmosphere by the Inhuman King Black Bolt, whom
you can learn more about in our Shazam vs.

365
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:11,815
Black Bolt duel episode. The mutant known as
Mirage, another illusionist, convinced Regan

366
00:34:11,855 --> 00:34:17,637
to seek treatment at the X-Men healing facility
set up by Storm called X-Haven. When Professor

367
00:34:17,797 --> 00:34:22,319
X and Magneto founded a home for mutants on
the sentient island nation of Krakoa, they

368
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:27,621
established a process for resurrecting mutants
using a combination of mutant powers, including

369
00:34:27,781 --> 00:34:34,124
mass generation, reality warping, time manipulation,
and genetic and psychic archiving. Using a

370
00:34:34,204 --> 00:34:40,168
DNA sample from Jason, they were able to bring
Mastermind back to life after he had succumbed

371
00:34:40,228 --> 00:34:45,753
to the legacy virus years ago. He ended up partnering
with the villain Mr. Sinister, helping him

372
00:34:45,813 --> 00:34:51,058
keep secret a clone farm that he had set up
behind the Krakoan Council's back. You can

373
00:34:51,078 --> 00:34:56,424
learn more about Krakoa in his duel against
Danny the Street. Powers-wise, Mastermind has

374
00:34:56,444 --> 00:35:01,829
the mutant ability to cast psychic illusions.
His illusions affect all the senses of his

375
00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:07,636
victims. making them able to see, hear, smell,
touch, and even taste what is projected into

376
00:35:07,676 --> 00:35:12,399
their minds. This not only lets Mastermind alter
his opponent's perception of their environment,

377
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:18,102
but also their perception of him. These illusions
are so strong that even if a person is consciously

378
00:35:18,162 --> 00:35:23,506
aware that they're inside of an illusion, their
mind will still react to it as if it were reality.

379
00:35:23,946 --> 00:35:28,769
He can extend his illusions to affect up to
an entire city, and the more intelligent the

380
00:35:28,809 --> 00:35:33,670
victim, the greater the effect. His one weakness
is that he has to keep his concentration in

381
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:38,352
order to maintain his illusions, leaving him
vulnerable to people who aren't under his influence.

382
00:35:38,892 --> 00:35:44,693
Finally, Mastermind carries a regular handgun,
and he will shoot your ass. How's that for

383
00:35:44,734 --> 00:35:52,136
a superpower? Pfft, I'm not scared! You're bringing
a gun to a mask fight, bro! Hahaha! Now Mastermind

384
00:35:52,176 --> 00:35:57,077
was in the movie X-Men 2, right? Like there
was a character, there was a combination between

385
00:35:57,177 --> 00:36:02,363
Mastermind and Legion. Yeah, he was William
Stryker's son. He was in a wheelchair and he

386
00:36:02,463 --> 00:36:08,165
basically manipulated Professor X to use Cerebro
in Stryker's plan to kill all mutants on Earth.

387
00:36:08,905 --> 00:36:13,847
This version of Mastermind in the movie was
very different from the comics version. The

388
00:36:13,887 --> 00:36:18,449
comics version isn't in a wheelchair. He doesn't
have two different color eyes and he's not

389
00:36:18,489 --> 00:36:23,539
the son of William Stryker. Gotcha. Okay. But
he was pretty twisted in that movie. I remember

390
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:27,963
Striker saying that his wife ended up killing
himself with a drill to the temple in order

391
00:36:28,003 --> 00:36:32,708
to bore the images out that Mastermind was casting
in there. So he's a pretty kind of scary villain,

392
00:36:32,848 --> 00:36:34,769
actually. Not a scary psycho pirate.

393
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:48,056
fantasies collide and heroes clash, one podcast
network rises above the rest. Prepare yourself

Visit dynamicpodcast.com where we settle the
debate and settle the score.

400
00:37:29,198 --> 00:37:33,221
But now that we've got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

401
00:37:33,261 --> 00:37:39,206
of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not this speculation,

402
00:37:39,506 --> 00:37:45,291
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could
play out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?

403
00:37:46,071 --> 00:37:50,075
Well, I should say there are no rules, other
than the characters have no prior knowledge

404
00:37:50,095 --> 00:37:54,498
of the other going into the fight. All they
are aware of starting out is that the other

405
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:59,618
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.
For the speculation... contestants will begin

406
00:37:59,638 --> 00:38:04,700
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript
environment that will have no bearing on the

407
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:10,083
match itself as no environmental statistics
are considered in my simulations the contestants

408
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:15,185
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright
then let's get into it. Psycho pirate and mastermind

409
00:38:15,205 --> 00:38:21,488
to meet on the battlefield who goes first? This
is gonna be hard I feel like but I'm gonna

410
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:28,059
say that psycho pirate goes first cuz he's just
crazy So he'll probably want to scare Mastermind

411
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:33,043
right away, you know, in order to feed off of
his fear. So Psycho Pirate starts by making

412
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:40,189
Mastermind see a series of mirrors surround
him, showing him grotesque exaggerated reflections

413
00:38:40,429 --> 00:38:46,614
of his own creepy ass face. That makes sense
because Mastermind is notoriously ugly in the

414
00:38:46,654 --> 00:38:51,518
comics and he often cloaks his appearance with
an illusion to make others see him as more

415
00:38:51,658 --> 00:38:56,270
handsome. So he's kind of insecure about that.
I feel like that's a good start. So he's gonna

416
00:38:56,350 --> 00:39:01,671
see his hideous form and he's gonna be like,
eeeeh, and he's gonna cast an illusion of darkness

417
00:39:01,851 --> 00:39:05,692
around the whole environment so that he can't
see himself and other people can't see him

418
00:39:05,732 --> 00:39:12,894
either. Wait, wait, so Psycho Pirate can't see?
Exactly. Okay, uh, fuck. In the comics, when

419
00:39:12,954 --> 00:39:18,296
Psycho Pirate wants to cast an emotion upon
someone, like you see that emotion form on

420
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:23,857
his Medusa mask, which is normally blank. I'm
not sure if people need to see that in order

421
00:39:23,917 --> 00:39:31,003
to feel the emotion. or if like the magic of
the mask projects that emotion on them regardless.

422
00:39:31,023 --> 00:39:36,985
Well, it's called the Medusa mask, right? That's
that's true. You probably have to see the mask

423
00:39:37,025 --> 00:39:42,246
in order to be affected by it. So that would
actually make this darkness illusion probably

424
00:39:42,286 --> 00:39:46,987
much more effective than you realized it would
be. I don't really think Psycho Pirate can

425
00:39:47,048 --> 00:39:51,289
do anything about it either. So I guess it's
still your move. OK. All right. All right.

426
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:55,670
So the darkness is there. And then suddenly
the lights come back on. and Psycho Pirate

427
00:39:55,690 --> 00:40:01,071
finds himself in a medieval torture chamber
illusion and he's strapped to like this torture

428
00:40:01,091 --> 00:40:07,773
rack where this executioner guy is slowly stretching
Psycho Pirate and Psycho Pirate's in a tremendous

429
00:40:07,813 --> 00:40:14,555
amount of pain actually believing that he's
being stretched. Oh okay uh wow uh can Mastermind

430
00:40:14,715 --> 00:40:20,897
see what's happening to Psycho Pirate? Yeah
yeah actually he's in disguise as the executioner

431
00:40:21,037 --> 00:40:26,407
I'm gonna say. Sweet okay. Now, even though
Psycho Pirate is in like an extreme amount

432
00:40:26,447 --> 00:40:33,130
of pain, his Medusa Mask has a smile on its
face, which causes a bunch of feathers to dance

433
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:38,792
around Mastermind, tickling him and making him
laugh and be happy, which breaks his concentration

434
00:40:38,832 --> 00:40:43,574
and causes him to drop the illusion. Tickling?
What's the stupidest thing I've ever heard

435
00:40:43,614 --> 00:40:50,377
of? Hey, don't tell me that! Tell Mastermind!
So, Psycho Pirate is back on his feet and Mastermind

436
00:40:50,477 --> 00:40:57,162
is just giggling like an idiot. Wait, so Mastermind
is being tickled because the Medusa mask conjured

437
00:40:57,242 --> 00:41:02,247
up a way for him to be happy, and that's what
happened? Yeah, that's how he feels he would

438
00:41:02,287 --> 00:41:08,893
be happy, by being tickled. Okay. Hahaha. Stupid.
So Mastermind is probably wondering what the

439
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:14,258
fuck's going on as he's being tickled. Uh, yeah,
the illusion drops. He's probably gonna assume

440
00:41:14,298 --> 00:41:20,158
that the feathers that are tickling him have
manifested- due to his opponent. So he's gonna

441
00:41:20,318 --> 00:41:24,600
try as he can to fight through the silliness
and he's gonna cast a bunch of duplicates of

442
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,443
himself, like 20 duplicates around the battlefield
who aren't being tickled and they surround

443
00:41:30,483 --> 00:41:35,865
Psycho Pirate in like this circle. And this
is gonna cause the feathers to disappear since

444
00:41:35,965 --> 00:41:41,327
Psycho Pirate believes that there's suddenly
a lot more opponents to contend with. Interesting,

445
00:41:41,547 --> 00:41:46,289
okay. So Psycho Pirate, you know, he's probably
gonna try and defend himself from the horde

446
00:41:46,309 --> 00:41:51,531
of masterminds. by making them feel wrath and
just start attacking each other. But of course,

447
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:56,212
this obviously isn't going to work because they're
not real. Right. And he's going to realize

448
00:41:56,252 --> 00:42:00,173
that he's going to realize that they must be
fake because, you know, his mask can affect

449
00:42:00,373 --> 00:42:06,515
even beings as powerful as the specter. Now,
this wrath is going to affect the real mastermind,

450
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:11,917
and he's just going to run into the circle of
illusion duplicates that he created and try

451
00:42:11,937 --> 00:42:16,991
to start physically attacking Psycho Pirate.
But before he can. Psycho pirate switches from

452
00:42:17,051 --> 00:42:22,996
inciting wrath to inciting trust. Not before
mastermind shoot psycho pirate with his handgun

453
00:42:23,256 --> 00:42:31,823
in all of his wrath. An illusion bullet or a
real one? Straight up real ass bullet. Psycho

454
00:42:31,843 --> 00:42:37,647
pirate gets shot. Too bad mastermind aimed for
psycho pirate's head because that bullet just

455
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:46,026
bounced right off of the Medusa mask. So psycho
pirate is shocked, but he's not dead. unconscious

456
00:42:46,066 --> 00:42:50,968
if he was shot in the mask. Yeah, it's like
made of magic metal. He's been shot in the

457
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:58,791
mask before. Really? Yeah. So now that Psycho
Pirate knows Mastermind has a gun, uh, that's

458
00:42:58,811 --> 00:43:05,234
when he's going to project severe depression
and just cause Mastermind to, you know, unalive

459
00:43:05,254 --> 00:43:13,217
himself with his own gun. Jeez. That's dark.
That's real dark. You must be from the DC universe.

460
00:43:13,577 --> 00:43:19,215
Um. Except by this point, I'm gonna say Mastermind
is pretty much onto Psycho Pirate's powers

461
00:43:19,255 --> 00:43:26,257
of emotional manipulation. So, before Psycho
Pirate makes Mastermind depressed, Mastermind

462
00:43:26,297 --> 00:43:30,958
is gonna cast an illusion of like a thick cloud
of gas to hide himself. And Psycho Pirate's

463
00:43:30,998 --> 00:43:36,580
gonna see it as poison gas. He's gonna think
it's poison gas, so Psycho Pirate's gonna choke

464
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,801
on it and die. In reality, just choking on,
you know, the air or his own spit or something.

465
00:43:42,782 --> 00:43:47,804
How would Psycho Pirate know if a gas he's breathing
in is poisonous? Because it looks poisonous,

466
00:43:47,844 --> 00:43:51,566
you know, it's gonna be like a green gas that
smells like sulfur or something like that.

467
00:43:51,586 --> 00:43:58,089
Okay. But, I mean, it's not real poisonous gas.
So, you know, Psycho Pirate's just gonna wake

468
00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:04,932
up while he's on the ground and realize he wasn't
really choking. So now he's pissed and he's

469
00:44:04,952 --> 00:44:11,050
gonna project the Earth-2 versions of the entire
Justice Society. You know, like Dr. Fate, Hawkman,

470
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:16,454
Green Lantern, all the badasses. And they're
just going to straight up beat Mastermind to

471
00:44:16,494 --> 00:44:22,257
death. What does the justice society have to
do with emotions? They don't, but he can also

472
00:44:22,437 --> 00:44:30,322
manifest beings who died in like past dead universes.
OK, and these projections are real or they're

473
00:44:30,362 --> 00:44:37,914
illusions? They are illusions, but they are
solid. They're solid constructs. OK, so. Mastermind

474
00:44:37,974 --> 00:44:42,636
sees the Justice Society and before he gets
beaten up, he casts an illusion of the X-Men.

475
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:47,399
And the X-Men are gonna beat the shit out of
Psycho-Pirate, or you know, that's what Psycho-Pirate

476
00:44:47,439 --> 00:44:52,002
experiences anyway. And he's just gonna die
from the pain of being beat up by the X-Men.

477
00:44:52,182 --> 00:44:57,004
Illusion X-Men. And I think that's the perfect
place to end the match. Either Mastermind gets

478
00:44:57,064 --> 00:45:03,788
beat up by the projections of the Justice Society,
or Psycho-Pirate's mind succumbs to the pain

479
00:45:03,988 --> 00:45:08,963
of being beat up by illusions of the X-Men.
Alright yeah, that's a great place to leave

480
00:45:09,064 --> 00:45:12,807
off. Let's go ahead and find out which of these
scenarios happens by inputting the character's

481
00:45:12,847 --> 00:45:19,073
stats, running the simulations, and coming back
with a winner. AJ9K, hit it! Inputting data.

482
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:26,480
Running calculations. Processing results. Simulations
complete. Now should we have run stats on the

483
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:34,370
JSA vs the X-Men for this particular speculation?
Oh jeez, no. No, we just ran the stats between

484
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:39,294
Mastermind and PsychoPirate and let me tell
you, these guys are not impressive statistically.

485
00:45:39,774 --> 00:45:46,018
No, they are super weak, which surprised me
honestly because PsychoPirate is kind of a

486
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:53,023
big deal in DC somewhat. Like he always seems
to be involved in some crisis or another. But

487
00:45:53,063 --> 00:45:57,666
yeah, statistically, not impressive. I mean,
they're average when it comes to things like

488
00:45:57,786 --> 00:46:03,862
speed, durability, strength, fighting skill,
intelligence. You know, these guys were pretty

489
00:46:03,902 --> 00:46:09,104
basic. Where they both kind of shine though,
is more along the lines of evasiveness, range

490
00:46:09,344 --> 00:46:14,647
and versatility. They're really more about like
manipulating things than actually doing damage

491
00:46:14,687 --> 00:46:20,109
to them. Right, exactly. But when it came to
things like range and evasiveness, we did give

492
00:46:20,249 --> 00:46:25,472
Mastermind the slight edge. Considering the
fact that yeah, we figured people probably

493
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:31,195
do need to be looking at the Medusa mask for
it to affect them. And outside of major feats

494
00:46:31,215 --> 00:46:36,561
like the crisis on infinite earths with affecting
entire multiverses or the new 52 where Psycho

495
00:46:36,581 --> 00:46:41,886
Pirate was an actual psychic and that was retconned,
Psycho Pirate really didn't have the same sort

496
00:46:41,926 --> 00:46:46,871
of common feats that Mastermind had when it
came to affecting large groups of people. Psycho

497
00:46:46,912 --> 00:46:51,937
Pirate got the edge in perception though because
he can actually sense people's emotions and

498
00:46:51,977 --> 00:46:56,881
then feed off of it. Right, and he also got
a slight edge in intelligence despite being

499
00:46:57,061 --> 00:47:03,528
insane. He's still one of the foremost authorities
on emotions and manipulation in DC. So taking

500
00:47:03,568 --> 00:47:08,572
all of this into account, Joseph, who do you
think came out on top? I don't know. It's so

501
00:47:08,612 --> 00:47:13,297
hard to say. I mean, I think these characters
were really hard to pin down statistically

502
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:19,134
due to the nature of their powers. The speculation
was actually really hard. As you guys know,

503
00:47:19,174 --> 00:47:22,917
we edit these episodes and if we didn't, you'd
just hear long pauses as we were trying to

504
00:47:22,937 --> 00:47:27,019
figure out what the heck to do. Which is strange
considering that conceptually these guys can

505
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:32,203
do so many different things, but it's hard to
conceptualize a battle between two illusion

506
00:47:32,243 --> 00:47:36,806
casters and how that would affect each other
kind of, you know? Yeah. So feeling so in the

507
00:47:36,866 --> 00:47:41,309
dark on all of this, I think I'm just going
to go with my gut and choose Mastermind as

508
00:47:41,349 --> 00:47:47,013
my guess for who's going to win. Instagram does
not agree with me. 69% of our poll takers there.

509
00:47:47,554 --> 00:47:51,997
believe that Psycho Pirate is actually going
to take this one. And that actually surprised

510
00:47:52,057 --> 00:47:57,282
me because I don't think Psycho Pirate is that
much more popular than Mastermind, you know,

511
00:47:57,322 --> 00:48:03,628
considering Mastermind was sort of in an X-Men
movie. I kind of chalked this up to not only

512
00:48:03,828 --> 00:48:08,632
Psycho Pirate's involvement with major crises
that kind of, you know, make him feel bigger

513
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:14,277
than he actually is, but also because he kind
of looks like Iron Man in like a medieval jester

514
00:48:14,337 --> 00:48:20,469
costume. Mastermind probably has the worst supervillain
costume in all of Marvel comics. It's really

515
00:48:20,509 --> 00:48:27,552
bad. He basically just wears like a brown sack,
so he's not impressive looking visually. Well,

516
00:48:27,572 --> 00:48:34,636
let's see if he's impressive in his win rate.
AJ 9K, the results, please. Hey, Yuasa. The

517
00:48:34,676 --> 00:48:44,606
winner of the matchup between Psycho Pirate
and Mastermind is. Psycho Pirate. Okay, barely.

518
00:48:44,626 --> 00:48:52,172
By how much? PsychoPirate won 517 of the 1000
matches compared to Mastermind who won 483.

519
00:48:53,993 --> 00:49:01,659
So it's 51.7% compared to 48.3% of the total
matches. That's pretty close. Yeah, it was

520
00:49:01,699 --> 00:49:06,662
really close. It's pretty much a coin toss,
tit for tat. Less no fun. You know, you would

521
00:49:06,682 --> 00:49:11,530
think for characters that have vaguely similar
power sets, but are entirely different. There'd

522
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:15,392
be a greater discrepancy in the win rate, but
I guess this was maybe just a better match

523
00:49:15,412 --> 00:49:20,076
than we thought. Apparently, and you were really
scared when we got into the main event. Yeah,

524
00:49:20,096 --> 00:49:23,658
I guess I shouldn't have been though. I should
have trusted my own judgment. Or Miggies, whoever

525
00:49:23,698 --> 00:49:27,041
thought of this matchup. Yeah, it was pretty
interesting. It was pretty fun to try and come

526
00:49:27,081 --> 00:49:31,163
up with the speculation. I thought it was going
to be so much more interesting. I'm actually

527
00:49:31,183 --> 00:49:36,207
a little bit disappointed in myself, but it
was really hard to combat how PsychoPirate

528
00:49:36,507 --> 00:49:42,319
kept making Mastermind feel certain emotions,
you know? It was fun. Tickle, tickle, tickle.

529
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:49,625
Stupid. I tell you what, though, you tickle
me. I'm not experiencing joy. I'm experiencing

530
00:49:49,805 --> 00:49:55,170
pure rage. That's how you listen to your rage
out of me. But that does it for this duel,

seen it yet because it actually comes out the

540
00:50:42,643 --> 00:50:47,046
day we released this episode, but Psycho Pirate
is a character in there and I'm looking forward

541
00:50:47,066 --> 00:50:51,009
to watching it. I really liked what they did
with the first one. Yeah it was interesting.

542
00:50:51,489 --> 00:50:54,831
