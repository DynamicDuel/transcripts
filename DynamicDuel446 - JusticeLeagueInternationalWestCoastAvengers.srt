00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,860
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi, welcome to
the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:33,080
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:38,020
their characters and stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin

4
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:44,020
brother, Marvelous Joe. And in this episode, we
are taking a break from the reviews to do a team

5
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:50,520
duel, this time a rematch between the Justice
League and Avengers, but more specifically, the

6
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,480
Justice League International against the West
Coast Avengers. Yeah, there are different

7
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:00,700
spin-off branches of the traditional Justice
League and Avengers teams. I got to say, Jonathan,

8
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:06,780
this is my chance for sweet ass revenge against the
Justice League for what happened in our first

9
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:13,300
initial team duel all those years ago. Yeah, that
was episode 100. That seems like forever ago. It

10
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:19,840
was back in 2018, back when we were just kids. Oh,
what I wouldn't give to be seven years younger.

11
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,120
Well, it's gonna be a fun match this episode. Look
forward to that later on. Before that, we're not

12
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:30,160
going to break down the comic book movie news
because as per the norm for the past several weeks,

13
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:35,440
there really isn't any like James Gunn has been
talking a lot about various DC projects, but

14
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:42,160
nothing really concrete. Penguin did get
nominated for 24 Emmys, but that's not really news

15
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,320
until I actually win something. We're all just
kind of waiting for Fantastic Four to come out and

16
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:53,360
just lose horribly box office wise and critically
to Superman. Yeah, when Fantastic Four beats

17
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,320
Superman's opening weekend, we could definitely
talk about that in the new section. That'll be fun.

18
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,280
Yeah, or vice versa. Superman beats Fantastic
Four. It's not going to happen. You sack of shit.

19
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:10,240
Roll up. Roll up, bro. I guess we'll find out later
on this week what happens. But as always, we list

20
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:14,360
our segment times in our episode description, so
feel free to check out the show notes if you want to

21
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:19,480

00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:21,060
John and Dean simulate battles between popular
video game characters. In yesterday's episode,

33
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:27,160
they determined who would win between Rayman and
Jake the dog from Adventure Time. Over on the Max

Destruction podcast hosts Scotty and Gilly, Pay
Your Favor Action Heroes from film and television

35
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:37,840
against each other. This week, they'll be finding
out who would win between Aaron Cross from The Born

36
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,040
Legacy and Jack Reacher. And on the San Joe World
podcast hosts Zachary Hepburn speculates on

37
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,940
fights between fan favorite anime and manga
characters. In his next episode, Zach's going to

38
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:57,680
reveal who would win between Injun from Gaichi
Akura and Naito Mudano from Togon Anki. There's no

39
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,780
way I'm pronouncing any of that right. Visit

notes to listen to all of the shows in the Diner Mike
podcast network. But with that out of the way,

41
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:15,820
quick to the no prize. A no prize is an award that
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version, the

42
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:21,360
Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award we post on
Instagram for the person that we feel gave the best

43
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,860
answer to our question of the week. Last week, we
asked you guys, what do you want the sequel to the

44
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:32,280
Superman movie to be about? And this is coming off
of the phenomenal box office opening weekend for

45
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,340
the Superman movie, which will more than likely
warrant a sequel for the character. We got quite a

46
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,380
few answers. We're going to break down this week's
honorable mentions before revealing the no prize

47
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:48,780
winner. Our first honorable mention goes to
Travis Herndon, who said, What's up, dead, I'm a

48
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:56,200
dude. Travis here. Shout out to my evil twin. So my
answer would be, be like, what if Superman is for

49
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,440
the sequel actually meets Mongol? I think Mongol
would be a pretty cool villain to introduce in the

50
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,400
sequel. He's a tank. This dude is powerful. And
this guy also be a nice little wedding of the

51
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:13,140
appetite for DC fans for like whenever dark side
shows up, like, hey, this guy with rock and swoop

52
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:18,780
man, shit, magic dark side rocking them. Yeah, I
love the idea of Superman going up against a

53
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:25,140
formidable physical threat like Mongol, who
literally owns an entire planet that's

54
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:31,020
essentially like a Death Star, but way cooler.
Yeah, war world. Yeah, we haven't seen Mongol on

55
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,760
the silver screen yet. I'd love to see someone new
for Superman to fight. And Mongol is a great

56
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:43,800
choice. And we know that he exists within this DC
universe because we saw his sister Mongal in the

57
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,380
Suicide Squad movie that James Gunn also
directed. That is correct. But hopefully Mongol

58
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:53,680
wouldn't go out like a punk ass like she did with the
helicopter. Right, right, right, right. Great

59
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,800
answer. Travis, our next honorable mention goes
to Alex Albro, who said, Hey guys, given the

60
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,620
message from Superman's parents, I think there's
still a lot left on the table for the media to begin

61
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:08,100
Superman, especially if the antagonist of the
second movie is some sort of Kryptonian invader. I

62
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,640
think you can get Kara involved there, depending
on how they handle it. You could even cause a rift

63
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:17,020
between Superman and Lois based on his actions. I
think the second movie should end darker just

64
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,820
since this first one was pretty upbeat and
positive. And I think we still benefit from seeing

65
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,220
Superman in a vulnerable position. I think Lex
should stay in jail till the third movie or till

66
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,260
maybe a Justice League team up where he comes back
with an injustice gang. Now, of course, we've seen

67
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:34,380
Kryptonian threats go up against Superman in
films like Superman to Antiban of Steel,

68
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:40,240
specifically with Zod and his crew. I think if you
weren't going to go that direction just to do

69
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,020
something new, though, other Kryptonian threats
could include like Doomsday or maybe like an evil

70
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,540
version of the eradicator. We've seen Doomsday as
well, but I think this would be an opportunity to do

71
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:56,880
him even better than BVS did. That's right. Yeah,
we haven't seen him done right, at least. You know,

72
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,900
you could do actually, there is a recent villain
called Rogel Zarr that was created by Jim Lee, who I

73
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,860
think was a creation of Jor-El, and he was revealed
to actually be the one responsible for Krypton's

74
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:13,300
destruction. That might be interesting. That
would be interesting. Great answer, Alex. Our

75
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:19,600
final honorable mention goes to Brayden
Schaffer, who said. Brayden here, I think the

76
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,600
perfect equal would have Zod being the villain. We
could see Superman fight an actual Kryptonian and

77
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:32,660
not a clone. We could see Zod not get killed on
screen this time. And we could see how the public

78
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:39,500
thinks of the rest of Krypton after, you know, the
whole news article. And I think it'd be great at the

79
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,420
end of that to have a post-credits scene teasing
Doomsday for that final kind of tease of

80
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:50,600
Superman's big fight. I mean, it is really hard to
do better than Zod. He's one of Superman's

81
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:57,400
ultimate foes. I wouldn't hate a reimagining of
him. And like Brayden and Alex said, it would be a

82
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:02,680
nice continuation of the story established in the
first Superman movie. Right. Continuing the

83
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,120
whole Kryptonian angle where they're more
conquerors, almost like Viltramites or

84
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,200
something like that. Great answer, Brayden. We
want to give a quick shout out to Lorenzo Valdez for

85
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:18,240
taking the time to visit our website and record an
answer. But the winner of this week's No Price is

86
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:25,360
Cornelius Robinson. Who said? Hey, guys, it's
Cornelius Robinson. And my idea for the next

87
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,980
Superman sequel, we introduced the villain,
Brainiac, you know, it would be too soon, but who

88
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:38,280
knows, it is new DC universe. A new character that
can also introduce as John Henry Irons, aka Steel,

89
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:45,140
and a possible return for Supergirl to help combat
this unknown thread and expanding Superman's

90
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:52,240
responsibility to Earth as well. I've been
waiting to see Brainiac on the silver screen for so

91
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,940
long. He is sort of the ultimate Superman villain.
And I don't understand why we haven't seen him on

92
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:04,380
screen yet. I think with Supergirl being
introduced in this universe, it also makes

93
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:09,300
perfect sense that Brainiac would come,
considering he's the one who shrunk the city of

94
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:15,380
Kandor, where Supergirl's parents lived. Yeah.
And since he's kind of a tech based villain, it'd be

95
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:20,740
cool for Superman to team up with another tech
based hero in Steel and introduce him in that movie

96
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:25,160
and actually get the whole Superman family going
up against Brainiac. I think that'd be cool. I

97
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,900
don't know if I'm quite ready for Steel. I do like
the idea of him coming around with the other reign

98
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:37,080
of the Superman Superman characters like
Superboy and the eradicator. But I could be wrong.

99
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,960
Steel is a really cool character. So great answer,
Cornelius. You win this week's No Prize. If you're

100
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:46,380
the listener want to shot at winning your own No
Prize. Stay tuned to later on in this episode, when

101
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:51,400
we'll be asking another question of the week,
which is right now. So onto the question of the

102
00:09:51,400 --> 00:10:01,280
week. For those who have seen the Fantastic Four
first steps in its opening weekend, what did you

103
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:07,100
think? And why was it inferior to Superman? If you
want to include that in your answer, you mean

104
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:11,660
superior. Record your answer at dynamicduel.com

107
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,660
podcast. We'll pick our favorite answer and award

108
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:38,460
to Instagram. Be sure to answer before July 27th.
But now let's go ahead and move on to the main events

109
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:45,160
of this episode, where we pits against each other,
the teams of the Justice League International and

110
00:10:45,160 --> 00:11:05,820
the West Coast Avengers. OK, Justice League
International versus the West Coast Avengers. As

111
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,760
we mentioned earlier, this is something of a
rematch for these two teams. Since the very first

112
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:17,260
team duel that we did in episode 100 of this podcast
was the Justice League versus the Avengers. But

113
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,780
those two teams have such broad rosters. We knew
eventually we would be able to get the best of the

114
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,960
best and we'd have to circle back with some of these
extra characters in the aftershoots that these

115
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:31,680
teams have had in the comics. Yeah, plus I just
really want to rematch. Yeah, I bet you do. And the

116
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,480
West Coast Avengers are just the perfect team to do
it. I don't know much about Justice League

117
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,140
International, but I know that they're not as good
as the West Coast Avengers, which is primarily

118
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:45,380
composed of your standard Avengers. They just
moved over to the West Coast for a while, operating

119
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:51,220
out of LA. Oh, they operate out of LA. Oh, yeah, the
Justice League International operates out of the

120
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:57,720
world, the whole world. It's international, not
regulated to a single coast. Where is their

121
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:04,080
headquarters? Actually, they have headquarters
all around the world as well. Oh, really? OK. Yeah.

122
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:12,060
Why be based around the world when you could be
based in LA? Right? Right. No. No. Well, since

123
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,920
these teams don't need too much setting up, let's
go ahead and get right into it. To explain the

124
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,740
methodology behind our duels, let's go to our
sentient dual simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000.

125
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:27,580
AJ9K, tell our listeners how you go about
determining a winner in our team dual matchups.

126
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:33,140
Yes, of course, sir. The way I determine a winner
between the two teams is by running 1000 Monte

127
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:38,220
Carlo simulations between every character on
each team using their statistics. A Monte Carlo

128
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:43,440
simulation is a probabilistic model used to
determine outcomes through random sampling. In

129
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,600
this case, I randomize the statistics along a
normal distribution as a way to simulate the many

130
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,580
variables that can occur during battle. The stat
parameters are based on the official Marvel power

131
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:58,860
grid from which the DC characters' statistics are
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are

132
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:04,440
included such as range, damage potential,
versatility and perception in order to create a

133
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,740
more detailed and accurate simulation. The
results of the 49000 simulations provide a

134
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:14,760
percentage of wins for each character on both
teams. The team with the higher average win rate is

135
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,100
declared the victor as they have a higher
probability to win any given battle. In an

136
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,360
equitable pairing, neither team should win 100%
of the matches. The comic book stories have shown

137
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,740
that there's even a way for Batman to defeat
Superman, so the confidence rate of my method

138
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,760
falls in line with the precedents that have been
established in the source material. My

139
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,360
mathematical simulations are without
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole

140
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,680
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K.

141
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,120
Before we run the simulations, though, we'd like
to break down each team's histories and rosters

142
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:53,180
before improvising a scenario on how we imagine
one of the thousands of simulations would play out

143
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:59,180
beat for beat. And I believe it's my turn to go
first. So let me break down the West Coast Avengers

144
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:06,600
history. Most of the New York City based Avengers
vanished when a cosmic being called the beyonder

145
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:12,800
whisked heroes and villains to a distant world to
watch them fight in a secret war. In their absence,

146
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,180
acting Avengers Chairman Vision, fearing Earth
was underprotected, convinced the US National

147
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:24,020
Security Council to approve a second Avengers
team roster on the Pacific Coast and chose Clint

148
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:29,840
Barton, Hawkeye, to command it. You can learn more
about the primary Avengers team in the episode

149
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,520
where we put them against the Justice League.
Hawkeye and his new wife, former shield agent

150
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:40,240
Bobby Mockingbird Morris, bought a neglected
seaside estate near Los Angeles and recruited to

151
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:47,640
the initial team the super strong Simon Williams,
AKA Wonder Man and Iron Man, who was actually Jim

152
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,860
Rhodes wearing Tony Stark's armor at the time,
while Stark worked on recovering from his

153
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:58,520
alcoholism. The giant sized scientist Bill
Foster, AKA Goliath, oversaw renovations that

154
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:04,180
turned the coastal property into a new base called
the Avengers compound. Rounding out the debut

155
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:10,780
roster was the feline heroine Greer Nelson, AKA
Tigra, a Chicago native who worked in a lab

156
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:16,200
undergoing secret conditioning experiments
that boosted her strength, speed and senses. She

157
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:22,180
was later transformed by a member of the Mystic Cat
people into the half human, half feline Tigra.

158
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:27,000
After establishing a career as a vigilante, she
auditioned for the Avengers, accepting

159
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,240
Hawkeye's call to help found the Pacific
Division. The West Coast Avengers first crime

160
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,940
fighting mission came when the thief called the
blank, fled a robbery with tech that accidentally

161
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:42,540
recalled the villain Graviton from exile.
Graviton tried to rip Los Angeles off its

162
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,680
foundations until the team brought him down. The
West Coasters then flew east in a Quinn jet to help

163
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:52,480
the original team stop the cosmic schemer
Maelstrom, proving the two branches could

164
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,600
operate side by side. Hank Pym, the original
Ant-Man, moved into the Avengers compound as its

165
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,740
resident scientist, while Wonder Man's brother,
the Grim Reaper, formed a new lethal legion with

166
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:10,340
Ultron and other villains. The legion ambushed
the compound and took the hero's captive, but

167
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:15,000
Mockingbird's surprise ambush distracted the
villains long enough for her teammates to break

168
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,180
free. The Reaper seemingly died in the fight and
Ultron retreated. James Rhodes soon revealed his

169
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:26,900
true identity in the Iron Man suit, after which the
recovered Tony Stark reclaimed to the armor and

170
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:32,900
roadie became War Machine. Tigra's increasingly
feral behavior attracted Craven the Hunter, who

171
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:38,040
stalked her across Hollywood backlots until the
Avengers drove him off. Soon afterward, the

172
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,820
team's newest member, a devout New Mexican hero,
Firebird, was hunted by the demon called Master

173
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:49,020
Pandemonium, intent on reclaiming shards of his
broken soul hidden within her. The Avengers

174
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:54,200
tracked the villain to the hidden realm of the cat
people, where Tigra bargained to merge her split

175
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:59,940
human and feline selves in return for
Pandemonium's death, a deal she later regretted.

176
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:06,099
The villain Dominus next lured the team to New
Mexico and used Dr. Doom's time platform to hurl

177
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:12,260
them backward through history. Mockingbird was
stranded in the 1800s, drugged by Phantom Rider,

178
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:17,420
into believing she loved him. The rest of the team
landed in ancient Egypt and clashed with Pharaoh

179
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:23,680
Rama Tut. The moon god Kahnchoo guided his modern
champion Moon Knight, Hank Pym and Firebird to

180
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:29,740
mount a rescue. After months of jumping through
time, the Avengers reunited, and Mockingbird let

181
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:36,420
her abuser fall to his death. Upon returning to the
present, the heroes defeated Dominus. A period of

182
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:42,380
governmental tension followed. The mystique's
federal squad, the Freedom Force, arrested both

183
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:47,960
Avengers branches on false trees and charges
devised by the Zodiac cartel. You can learn more

184
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:53,500
about mystique in her duel against Madame Rouge.
Soon after, Washington forced the unstable super

185
00:17:53,500 --> 00:18:00,740
soldier, John Walker, aka US agent, onto the West
Coast roster as Field Leader. Hawkeye resigned in

186
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:06,020
protests, Mockingbird followed, and the pair
mentored the quirky Great Lakes Avengers.

187
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:10,420
Meanwhile, in the International Coalition
dismantled Vision for his past attempt to seize

188
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:16,120
global computer networks. Hank Pym rebuilt him,
now chalk white and emotionless, because Wonder

189
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:21,260
Man refused to lend his brain patterns a second
time. You can learn more about Vision in his duel

190
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:26,520
against Marsha Manhunter. Vision's blank slate
worsened Scarlet Witch's grief after her twin

191
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:33,060
sons, created by her magic, were reabsorbed into
the demon Mephisto. Manipulated by Magneto and

192
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:38,420
Time Master Amortus, she attacked her teammates
until Agatha Harkness restored her mind. Roster

193
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:43,520
Turnover continued as Spider Woman and the
electricity-powered Living Lightning joined

194
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,500
the team. Stark, battling health issues, faked
his death and ceded the team lead to War Machine.

195
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:55,920
Interstellar Conflict soon pulled the West Coast
roster back into space. When Kree soldiers used a

196
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:01,240
Stargate near Earth to attack the rival Shiar
Empire, both Avengers teams split into three

197
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,180
squads to keep the fight away from the sun. The West
Coast unit failed to stop Shiar Commandos from

198
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:12,500
stealing the Kree Negabands and a bomb made from
that energy killed billions in Kree's space. Some

199
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:18,080
members, led by Iron Man, executed the Kree
Supreme Intelligence for that genocide, a choice

200
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,980
that offended others and left deep scars between
teammates. Back on Earth, the Avengers roster

201
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:31,160
shifted again. Tigra, Hank Pym and the Wasp moved
to reserve status, letting US agent Spider Woman

202
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,740
and Living Lightning step into full membership.
Hawkeye and War Machine rejoined and the teenager

203
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:42,880
Darkhawk joined as a part-time player. Ultron
returned in adamantium form, infected Hawkeye,

204
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,580
Tigra and Quicksilver with techno-organic
implants and unveiled Alkama, a murderous bride

205
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:53,520
cloned from Mockingbird's mind. The Avengers
purged the implants and turned Ultron's own

206
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,580
missile against him and Alkama, apparently
destroying them both. Hank Mann, backed by demons

207
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:03,580
Satanish and Mephisto, formed another lethal
legion and struck the depleted West Coast

208
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:09,180
Avengers. In the Infernal fight, Mockingbird
sacrificed herself to save Scarlet Witch and she

209
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:15,360
died in Clint's arms. The Avengers compound lay in
ruins, membership had fallen and disputes were

210
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:21,600
constant. Captain America convened an all-hands
vote and led by Stark, the majority closed the West

211
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:28,080
Coast branch. Stark then formed a new team called
Forceworks with several West Coast alumni, but

212
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,280
that group collapsed within a year and most
members drifted back to the main Avengers. The

213
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,820
deserted Avengers compound later reopened as the
training campus for teenage heroes of Avengers

214
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:44,400
Academy. California still lacked frontline
defenders, however, so Kate Bishop, the second

215
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,520
Hawkeye, started a detective agency in Santa
Monica. When giant Landsharks rampaged along the

216
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:56,320
pier, she called Clint for backup and assembled a
fresh West Coast Avengers lineup, including the

217
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,180
dimension-hopping Miss America, the
energy-absorbing Fuse, the sarcastic telepath

218
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:08,520
Kid Omega, and the reality-warping Gwen Pool, who
adopted a baby Landshark named Jeff. Mademask

219
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:14,180
soon captured the rookies with her West Coast
Masters of Evil, but Kate's ex-boyfriend, Novar,

220
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:20,080
aka Marvel Boy, helped them escape. The team then
received new headquarters in Venice Beach.

221
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,260
During the dark Elf Lord Malekith's invasion of
Earth, Kate joined a babysitting squad guarding

222
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:31,060
Thor's infant sister, Lhasa, while her teammates
fought Frost Giants in San Francisco. Afterward,

223
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:35,500
Tony Stark and Rody organized a
rehabilitation-focused West Coast roster that

224
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:41,740
included longtime ally Spider Woman and veteran
hero Firestar. Their opening mission dismantled

225
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:47,240
a machine-based religious cult called the Gospel
of Ultrons, which was formed from the fragments of

226
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,020
Ultron. And that's the West Coast Avengers
history. For the seven-person roster going into

227
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:57,300
the team duel, I'll admit I was a little loose with
the official members. For starters, I did include

228
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:02,060
several of the founding West Coast Avengers
members, including War Machine, Wonder Man, and

229
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:07,940
Tigra. The Wasp was an early recruit to the team, so
I'm including her. Quicksilver was a later

230
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:12,820
recruit, but I've been dying to squeeze him in a
team duel and passed over our last X-Factor duel

231
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:18,280
just to have him here. For the final two spots, I'll
admit I'm going a little rogue and blurring the

232
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,640
lines between what constitutes a West Coast
Avenger and a regular Avenger. Black Panther has

233
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,680
never officially been part of the West Coast
roster, but he has fought alongside them. And

234
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,900
given that he's been a major player for the
Avengers over the years, I thought it best that I

235
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,800
include him in one of these team duels. The same
goes for Hercules, who again has never been an

236
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:43,040
official West Coast member, but is an Avenger
nevertheless, through and through. And frankly,

237
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,180
a lot of the other prominent West Coast Avengers
members have already been in team duels like

238
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:53,080
Hawkeye, Ant-Man, Scarlet Witch, and Vision were
with the main Avengers in their duel. Mockingbird

239
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,660
was with the A-Force, Moon Knight was with the
Defenders, US Agent was just with the

240
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,240
Thunderbolts. I could have gotten some reserve
members in here like Darkhawk or Firebird or

241
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,900
Living Lightning, but I thought it was better to go
with Black Panther and Hercules. Because now I

242
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:13,060
think you can say that most of the classic comic
Avengers have been in a team duel. So to reiterate,

243
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:21,060
my West Coast Avengers team is War Machine, Wonder
Man, TIGRA, The Wasp, Quicksilver, Black Panther

244
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:29,160
and Hercules. That may be most bored I've ever been
listening to one of your backstories. They don't

245
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:35,440
have a great backstory. It's not very thematic and
it's burdened by a lot of roster changes,

246
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,860
enclosures and things like that. At least the
roster is cool. I actually really like this

247
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:45,540
roster, even though it's not entirely faithful.
It is a good cast of Avengers characters, I would

248
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:50,120
say. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, largely you went
with these characters also because of the

249
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:56,320
pairings with the JLI roster that you have in that
we like to keep things even between the teams by

250
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,300
pairing each individual character with a
counterpart from the other side, but I'll let you

251
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:06,080
get into the Justice League International roster
as you get into their history, which I'll do now.

252
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,280
Now, after the disbanding of the original Justice
League of America, a new United Nations backed

253
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:16,800
initiative formed a global peacekeeping
superhero team under the banner of the Justice

254
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:22,240
League. The league was reorganized with the
intention of operating internationally with

255
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:29,100
multiple embassies and government oversight.
Spearheaded by UN liaison Maxwell Lord, the new

256
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:35,740
team operated out of the embassies in New York
City, Moscow, Paris, London and Tokyo with their

257
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:41,480
primary headquarters in the secret sanctuary, a
former hidden headquarters of the Justice League

258
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:47,440
of America just outside of Happy Harbor, Rhode
Island. The initial roster consisted of a mix of

259
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:54,040
veteran heroes and newer recruits. Blue Beetle,
Booster Gold, Guy Gardner, the Green Lantern,

260
00:24:54,040 --> 00:25:01,440
Martian Manhunter, Black Canary, Shazam, Dr.
Fate and Mr. Miracle, with Batman serving as a

261
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:08,820
guiding presence. Over time, the team added more
international members, such as Fire from Brazil,

262
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:16,040
Ice from Norway, Rocket Red from the Soviet Union
and the Crimson Fox from France. The group

263
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,460
developed a reputation for balancing world
threatening commissions with interpersonal

264
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:26,380
dysfunction and comedic tension, particularly
between characters like Guy Gardner and Booster

265
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:31,860
Gold. The team battled numerous global threats,
including a new royal flush gang and the

266
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:36,960
time-manipulating overmaster. They also
defended Earth from alien invasions and

267
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:43,000
collaborated with other superhero groups around
the world. As the organization grew, it fractured

268
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,760
into multiple branches. The main team continued
as Justice League International, while a

269
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:54,760
European branch was founded later under the name
Justice League Europe, operating out of a Chateau

270
00:25:54,760 --> 00:26:00,700
in the Loré Valley of France. Justice League
Europe's roster eventually included elongated

271
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:07,640
men, metamorpho, power girl and Captain Adam.
Though the league enjoyed official recognition,

272
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:14,020
tensions arose with traditional US authorities
and internal conflicts began to weaken its unity.

273
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:19,120
Maxwell Lord increasingly manipulated the
team's direction behind the scenes, using his

274
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,980
influence and technology to control outcomes.
The team's operations took them across the globe,

275
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:30,160
from Japan to Bialia, a fictional Middle Eastern
country where they were often entangled in

276
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:35,320
political intrigue. In one mission, they stopped
the Queen Bee's attempt to create a mid-human

277
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:44,460
army. Another one took them to Apocalypse, where
Mr. Despite their successes, the team was often

278
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:50,800
mocked by the media as being more of a circus than a
serious force, a reputation not helped by the

279
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:56,800
personalities of its more flamboyant members.
Booster Gold and Blue Beetle, in particular,

280
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:01,340
developed a close friendship that became central
to the team's dynamic, often spearheading

281
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:07,120
care-brained business ventures and stunts that
caused both trouble and amusement for the group.

282
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,640
Over time, leadership changed hands. Batman
eventually left due to ideological differences

283
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:18,280
with Maxwell Lord. Captain Adam took a leadership
role for a time, while Martian Manhunter served as

284
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:23,640
a stabilizing presence. The league continued
operating internationally, but fractures

285
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:29,180
deepened when internal corruption was revealed.
Maxwell Lord was exposed for secretly

286
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:34,900
manipulating events using a computer system
called Kilgore. After being shot, Lord was

287
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:41,120
temporarily replaced by Oberon and later by other
UN appointees. The Justice League International

288
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,690
eventually disbanded. Some of its members
continued on with a newly reformed Justice League

289
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:53,350
of America, while others retired or pursued solo
missions. Years later, Maxwell Lord attempted to

290
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:59,050
rebrand his public image and reassemble a
smaller, more relatable superhero team. He

291
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:04,090
contacted several former members of the Justice
League International and convinced them to join a

292
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:09,850
new low-profile operation known as the Super
Buddies. Operating out of a strip mall office in

293
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:16,150
Queens, New York, the team included Blue Beetle,
Booster Gold, Fire, Elongated Man, his wife Sue

294
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:22,410
Dibney, and Captain Adam, along with Maxwell Lord
and Oberon as support staff. Later additions

295
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:28,430
included Mary Marvel and the magical chimpanzee
Detective Chimp. The Super Buddies focused on

296
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:33,730
local threats and public engagement. Their
operations were less about world saving and more

297
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:38,410
about improving their public image and
self-esteem. They tackled issues like hostage

298
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:44,190
situations and metahuman disputes, but often
found themselves overwhelmed or outmatched.

299
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:48,570
Despite the comedy and dysfunction that
surrounded the group, they genuinely tried to

300
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:53,810
help their community. At one point, the team was
kidnapped to hell by demons posing as

301
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:58,770
superheroes, forcing them to work together to
escape. In another incident, they were trapped

302
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:03,850
inside of a magical sitcom reality. The Super
Buddies eventually disbanded after realizing

303
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:09,350
they were not suited for full-time heroics. The
experience, however, deepened the bonds between

304
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:13,350
many of the original Justice League
International members and offered closure to

305
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:18,010
long-standing tensions within the group. After
the Super Buddies disbanded, several of its

306
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:22,470
members returned to mainstream superhero
activity. Maxwell Lord, who had remained

307
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:28,990
publicly dormant for years, resurfaced with
telepathic powers and a hidden agenda. Secretly

308
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:34,530
working to eliminate superhumans, he considered
dangerous. Lord reactivated a Brother Eye

309
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:40,710
satellite system and manipulated events to
incite distrust in metahuman. He covertly used

310
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:45,770
his powers to control minds, including that of
Superman, who he turned against the League in a

311
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:52,170
test of loyalty. Blue Beetle uncovered Maxwell's
plot, but was unable to stop him. When Blue Beetle

312
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:58,710
refused to join Lord's cause, he executed him with
a gunshot to the head. This act set off the events of

313
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:04,050
Infinite Crisis, during which Wonder Woman was
forced to kill Maxwell Lord to free Superman from

314
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:09,050
his control. The Justice League International
era was definitively closed with Blue Beetle's

315
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:14,470
death, and many of its surviving members were left
shaken and disillusioned. That is, until

316
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:19,770
post-Flashpoint continuity, when the United
Nations again sanctioned a global superhero team

317
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:25,330
after the public debut of the original Justice
League. This time the team was formed explicitly

318
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:30,890
as a counterbalance to the independent nature of
the main League, with government oversight as a

319
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:36,530
prerequisite. Maxwell Lord was replaced by UN
director Andre Briggs, who selected Booster Gold

320
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:41,770
as the team's leader due to his public appeal and
historical record. Their new base of operations

321
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:47,250
was the United Nations Hall of Justice, designed
as a diplomatic and operational headquarters

322
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:54,310
rather than a superhero hideout. The new lineup
included Booster Gold, Guy Gardner, Fire Ice,

323
00:30:54,310 --> 00:31:00,990
Vixen, Gdiva, Red Rocket, and August General &
Iron. Batman joined the team as a representative

324
00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:05,710
of the original Justice League, assigned to
ensure that the new team would not jeopardize

325
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:12,110
global security. While Booster was nominally in
charge, Batman frequently stepped in as a de facto

326
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:18,510
leader during crises. Their first major mission
involved stopping the signalmen, giant alien

327
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:23,970
constructs awakened by unknown forces. The
League worked to neutralize the signalmen's

328
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:28,610
threat and discovered their connection to an
ancient interdimensional force. Their success

329
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:34,050
led to an increase in public support, and the
United Nations promoted their visibility as a

330
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:40,170
deterrent against metahuman threats. The League
soon faced internal strain as Gdiva and Booster

331
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:45,630
clashed over leadership and media handling. The
Rocket Red's armor, erratic behavior, and the

332
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:51,790
August General's authoritarian tactics caused
tension. Despite this, the team held together and

333
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:56,750
responded to global emergencies including alien
incursions, terrorism, and environmental

334
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:02,150
disasters. During a mission in the country,
Derain, the team was ambushed by a group of

335
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:07,670
cybernetically enhanced assassins under the
employee of the villain Breakdown. Rocket Red was

336
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:12,610
mortally wounded and several team members were
critically injured. Booster Gold was briefly

337
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:19,010
presumed dead after sacrificing himself to stop a
bomb. This marked the effective end of the Justice

338
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:23,690
League International. The UN officially
disbanded the group, setting its high casualty

339
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:29,570
rate and public relations issues. Booster Gold
later appeared, displaced in time. This future

340
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:34,670
self-involved an ecober effort to prevent
catastrophic events tied to the multiverse.

341
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:40,150
While the Justice League International did not
officially reform, its surviving members

342
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:45,630
continued to collaborate during global crises
and crossover events, often setting their shared

343
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:51,070
past as a source of camaraderie and tactical
coordination. Now for the Justice League

344
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:58,030
International's seven-member roster, I decided
to start with the iconic members of Booster Gold,

345
00:32:58,030 --> 00:33:04,090
the Blue Beetle Ted Cord, and the Green Lantern Guy
Gardner, as all three of them embody the often

346
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:10,610
comedic vibe of this Justice League iteration.
I've also included Elogated Man, as he was a

347
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:16,470
prominent member of both the Justice League
Europe and Super Buddies, and to include some true

348
00:33:16,470 --> 00:33:23,770
international flavor, I'm including the duo of
Fire and Ice, from Brazil and Norway, with Fire and

349
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:30,550
Ice powers respectively. For my seventh and final
member, I decided to go with Shazam, who was not

350
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:35,850
only an original member, but his sister
Mary-Marvel also had a presence on the Super

351
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:45,270
Buddies team. So again, my roster is Booster Gold,
Blue Beetle, Green Lantern, Elogated Man, Fire,

352
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:50,670
Ice, and Shazam. I gotta say your team's history
didn't seem that much better, with multiple

353
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:56,590
iterations and closures and things like that.
Wow, rude. I will say that the Justice League

354
00:33:56,590 --> 00:34:02,670
International does seem to have a more distinct
personality that separates it from the primary

355
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:07,550
Justice League. Yeah, it was definitely a much
more comedic tone than the primary Justice League

356
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:13,210
team, which was much more serious. Well, I don't
think the JLI is going to have much to laugh at as

357
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:17,630
they're getting their asses beat as we get into the
speculation here. I do want to state that the

358
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:22,710
pairings that we've decided for this matchup are
Blue Beetle and Black Panther, Booster Gold and

359
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:29,949
Wonder Man, Green Lantern and War Machine, Fire
and Tigra, Ice and Wasp, Elogated Man and

360
00:34:29,949 --> 00:34:35,210
Quicksilver and Shazam and Hercules, which are
pretty damn good pairings, I think. Yeah, I think

361
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:46,750
this should be good. In a world where fantasies
collide and heroes clash, one podcast network

Now that we got the team's histories and rosters

369
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:37,630
out of the way, let's speculate on how one of the
thousands of simulated matches will go. The

370
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:42,470
winners determined by simulations, not our
speculation, but it's fun to imagine how this

371
00:35:42,470 --> 00:36:07,330
fight could play out. AJ and I.K., what are the
rules of our speculation? Environmental

372
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:12,670
statistics are considered in my simulations. The
teams must earn victory on their own merit.

373
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,930
Alright then, let's get into it. The Justice
League International and the West Coast

374
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:22,090
Avengers, me on the battlefield, who goes first?
I'm gonna say I go first. I finally get to kick

375
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:27,790
things off with this Speedster character with
Quicksilver. And Quicksilver starts off by just

376
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:33,770
running circles around the Justice League and he
creates this vortex that sucks all the year away

377
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:39,030
from all of the Justice League members. And he
extinguishes fires, flames, and the Justice

378
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:46,230
League just passes out. No, I'm gonna say that
before everyone passes out, ice is going to freeze

379
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:53,490
the ground around them. Quicksilver to slip right
into a giant green hand raising the middle finger

380
00:36:53,490 --> 00:37:00,830
that was generated by Guy Gardner. And actually, a
bunch of giant green hands and fists are going to

381
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:05,330
erupt beneath the Avengers, swatting and
slapping and punching them all across the

382
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:12,070
environment. Somebody saw Superman. Yeah, I did.
Okay, so the Avengers are getting knocked around

383
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:17,410
by these giant green hands, but suddenly I'm gonna
say Green Lantern gets a glowing green dagger

384
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:23,450
blade right through his chest. Because Black
Panther used his agility to avoid the hand

385
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:30,350
constructs, and then he chucked a green Vibranium
energy dagger at Green Lantern, and green means

386
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:36,750
it's set to stun. So Guy Gardner's stunned, he
falls forward, lands right on his face, and he's

387
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:43,250
passed out for the time being. And then War Machine
just starts unleashing his shoulder-mounted

388
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:48,290
minigun at Blue Beetle and Booster Gold, just
targeting between the two of them and turning them

389
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:53,010
into human Swiss cheese. Well, Booster Gold, you
know, he'll fire up his force field to protect

390
00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:58,770
himself. And Blue Beetle, he's just gonna start
doing backflips to dodge the gunfire. And he's

391
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:05,690
gonna backflip onto a trapeze wire hanging below
his bug ship, which is gonna quickly retract up and

392
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:11,570
pull him into the ship before it fires this
electrified net onto War Machine, and that's

393
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:17,670
gonna pin him to the ground and just short-circuit
his suit. So while War Machine is busy dealing with

394
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:23,130
that, Booster Gold is gonna turn his attention to
Wonder Man, and he's gonna blast him with an energy

395
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:29,410
beam from his gauntlet. Who said you get the bug
ship during this fight? Me! I did! It's Blue

396
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:35,270
Beetle! I got it in the proler match! No, that's
right, that's right. Okay, so Booster Gold shoots

397
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:40,990
Wonder Man with an energy beam? Yes. I'm gonna say
before he gets that shot off, all of a sudden his arm

398
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:46,030
gets knocked away, and he misses. And he's like,
what, what just happened? So he tries again with

399
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:51,710
his other hand, and that gets knocked away too by
this small beam. Booster has no idea what's

400
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:56,610
happening, but then all of a sudden he gets fucking
rocked in the jaw with an uppercut, and it's the

401
00:38:56,610 --> 00:39:02,290
wasp. And he didn't see her because she had shrunk
down, and she used her stink blasts to knock

402
00:39:02,290 --> 00:39:08,330
Booster's arms off his aim, and then she gave him a
miniature sized uppercut, but still packed with

403
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:14,350
full-sized power. Oh, dank. Okay. Well,
meanwhile, Shuzam and Hercules, they're

404
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:20,230
probably wrestling, and Shuzam is like, you're
Hercules? I have all of your powers! And then some.

405
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:25,610
So with Hercules in a headlock, Shuzam's gonna
yell out his name, and he's gonna electrocute

406
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:31,010
Hercules with Azusa's lightning. Except at the
last second, Hercules maneuvers out of the

407
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:36,830
headlock, and he lifts Shuzam above his head just
as the lightning strike hits, which is gonna turn

408
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:41,050
Shuzam back into Billy Batson. And like, he didn't
know this was gonna happen, he just thought he'd

409
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:47,050
use Shuzam as a shield, but with Shuzam turned back
into a kid, Hercules is gonna spin the kid around,

410
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:53,830
swinging him by his ankles, and then just let go.
Billy like a discus over the horizon. Well, after

411
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:59,130
he threw Billy, I'm gonna say he didn't notice a
lightning strike in the distance where Billy was

412
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:06,350
thrown, and as Shuzam is racing back toward the
battle, fire and ice, meanwhile, are going to be

413
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:13,450
tag-teaming Tigra, just blasting her with both
waves of fire and freezing hail. Well, wouldn't

414
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:22,470
the fire melt the hail, and then the melted hail
would put out the fire? No. So like, fire and ice are

415
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:28,010
just cancelling their attack out, like a couple of
dumbasses, and Tigra is gonna leap high up into the

416
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:33,550
air, like way out of their blasts, and she's gonna
land with a pounce right on top of fire, just

417
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:39,330
slashing her face right off, and taking her out of
the match. Okay, here's the thing though, once

418
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:45,850
Tigra landed on fire, fire's whole body flamed up
like the human torch, so Tigra essentially just

419
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:53,510
sacrificed her body to eliminate fire, and with
her badly burned, it's gonna leave her wide open

420
00:40:53,510 --> 00:41:01,750
for ice to just freeze her solid for killing her
best friend. So Tigra's out now too. All right, but

421
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:08,610
Wonder Man saw that, and he's pissed off by that, so
he just flicks ice in the head, and now ice is out of

422
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:15,370
the match too. Wait, what? A flick? Yeah, Wonder
Man's like insanely strong, so like a flick from

423
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:23,670
Wonder Man is like getting hit with a sledgehammer
to the dome, so yeah, ice is out. Okay, well while

424
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:29,870
that happened, Elongated Man noticed
Quicksilver has, you know, recovered from the

425
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:35,650
start of the match, and so he's going to flatten
himself out along the ground of the battlefield,

426
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:42,130
and as Quicksilver is zipping around, once he runs
over Elongated Man, that's when his trap is going

427
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:47,760
to spring, and he's folding his body around
Quicksilver just suffocating him. Elongated

428
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,160
Man's not gonna be able to easily restrain
Quicksilver, because Quicksilver, he's gonna

429
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:58,240
shake and vibrate to give himself some space
within Elongated Man's trap, kind of like a rubber

430
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,180
ball in a balloon type situation, and when he has
enough space, Quicksilver's gonna spin like a

431
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:09,820
cyclone with his arms out, and that's just like
putting Elongated Man in a blender. So Elongated

432
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:15,100
Man gets knocked around and twisted, and
eventually he's gonna get flung away like a limp

433
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:20,920
noodle, and just be on the ground reeling from
getting punched like a thousand times in like 10

434
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:29,140
seconds. And while he's recovering, War Machine,
he reboots his armor from getting short circuited

435
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:35,100
by Blue Beetle's net, and he's gonna cut his way out
of the net using a plasma cutter on his wrist, which

436
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:40,400
kind of looks like a welding tool. But at that
point, War Machine's gonna shoot Blue Beetle's

437
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,720
bug ship just right out of the air with a bunch of
missiles fired from his arm-mounted rocket

438
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:52,600
launcher. So the bug ship gets hit, and it's gonna
crash to the ground and explode, which kills Blue

439
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:58,120
Beetle who's inside. Oh no, because like the bug
ship would be alerting Blue Beetle that the

440
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:03,940
missiles are coming, so Blue Beetle he'll eject
from the bug ship right before it gets hit by the

441
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:09,600
missiles, and as he's parachuting back to the
battlefield, he's actually going to control and

442
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:16,480
steer the crashing bug ship using controls and his
gloves into Black Panther, and that's gonna

443
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:22,520
obliterate him. Okay, okay. But as Blue Beetle is
parachuting to the ground, all of a sudden this

444
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:28,450
sword comes flying out of nowhere through the air
right at him, and it's the sword of Pellius, which

445
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:34,660
is Hercules Sword, Hercules threw it, and it
severs Blue Beetle's parachute cords, and he

446
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:43,420
falls to his death. Jeez. Okay, meanwhile Booster
Gold, he's too distracted to notice his friend

447
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:51,520
Blue Beetle's death just now, because he's been
using his future tech goggles to try and find and

448
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:57,180
track what hit him earlier, the wasp, and when he
finally pinpoints her buzzing around the

449
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:02,940
battlefield, he's gonna trap her in a tractor
beam, pull her right into his fist, and that's

450
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:08,800
where he's gonna crush her literally like a bug.
Well she could just grow to get out of his fist. No,

451
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,000
no, because he uses his force field energy to
create tractor beams, so she can't grow out of

452
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:21,640
that. Can't grow out of a force field? Right, it's
like a hard light energy bubble. Okay, uh, well War

453
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:27,800
Machine, he's using his armor's flamethrowers to
just ignite elongated man, and now elongated

454
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:33,160
man's out of this match. But no, it's not like
elongated man would just sit still long enough for

455
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:39,620
flamethrowers to take him out. As War Machine is
trying to burn him to death, elongated man is

456
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:46,600
dodging and flipping and that's when Shazam is
gonna zip over to War Machine and in a blur, he's

457
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:52,940
gonna yank off all of his weapons and armor before
War Machine can really do anything about it. And

458
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:58,820
with Rody standing there armorless, that's when
Shazam's gonna grab him and just eat him right into

459
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:05,180
outer space. Jesus. Well, elongated man may be
able to dodge flamethrowers, sure, but he's not

460
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:11,600
gonna dodge this sudden beam of ionic energy from
Wonder Man who shoots it out of his eyes. So

461
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:17,660
elongated man gets two holes just punched through
his head and now he's out of the match for real this

462
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:22,800
time. Okay, well you know who else is out of the
match? Quicksilver, because green lantern is

463
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,800
gonna generate glue all over the environment
floor around Quicksilver and that's gonna slow

464
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:33,640
him down long enough for green lantern to just
snatch him with a giant pair of chopper cable

465
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:40,040
pliers and those are gonna be connected to a giant
green battery which just fries Quicksilver.

466
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:47,440
Okay, but then, hey look Black Panther slashes his
way out of the rubble of the bug ship that crashed on

467
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:53,520
him. What? I mean he has vibranium mesh suit, you
know, that would just absorb the impact and it's

468
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:59,740
gonna like super charge him. So he slashes his way
out of the rubble and he has a reed on green

469
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:04,440
lantern's energy signature from his first attack
against him. So he knows Green Lantern's

470
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:10,880
weakness, he knows to target the ring from his
Kimoyo bead readout and while Guy is distracted,

471
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:17,240
frying Quicksilver, Black Panther leaps over and
slashes off Green Lantern's ring with his claws

472
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:22,760
and before Guy can even react, Black Panther
straight up unalives the guy with a kinetic

473
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:27,800
powered explosive kick right to his ribs just
shattering them. Wait, Black Panther cut off

474
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:36,400
Guy's finger? Yeah, that was actually a good move.
Sucky but good. Thanks. But Guy's ring is going to

475
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:43,120
seek out a new ring bearer and it's gonna choose the
closest most worthy hero and I'm gonna say that's

476
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:49,740
gonna be, who do I have left? Booster Gold and
Shazam? I'm gonna say it's Booster Gold. So I guess

477
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:57,660
he's Booster Green now with the ring and so he's
gonna trap Wonder Man in this futuristic battery

478
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:04,820
with cables attached to his suit and Booster Gold
is going to absorb Wonder Man's ionic energy form

479
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:12,580
into his suit, powering it up so Wonder Man himself
is just dissipated and now charging up Booster

480
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:19,700
Green. That's crazy. So I have Black Panther and
Hercules left and Black Panther's going up

481
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:25,460
against Shazam which sounds kind of one-sided but
little does Shazam know that Black Panther has

482
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:32,060
been recording this entire fight with his Kimoyo
beads. So Black Panther slides under Shazam and

483
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:38,440
one of his beads acts like a speaker and it shouts
out in Billy's voice Shazam which is gonna call

484
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:44,640
down the lightning and it transforms Shazam back
into Billy again and just when Billy is like aw man

485
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:52,580
again that's when Black Panther nerve strikes the
kid to put him down. It's child abuse man. So you

486
00:47:52,580 --> 00:48:01,300
have Black Panther and Hercules left? Well my last
guy, Booster Green, he's now super charged with

487
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:07,560
ionic energy and he's gonna have literally no
problem power boosting and converting his suit's

488
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:13,620
internal time travel technology to easily snap
the two Marvel guys right out of the time stream.

489
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:20,760
What? Boom two birds with one stone and the end of
this match. Can he do that? He can't transform his

490
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:28,240
technology with his power ring. He literally just
did but that's lame. I'm gonna say instead all of a

491
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:35,300
sudden Booster Green's ring turns purple. It
glows purple and cackles with this ionic energy

492
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:41,220
and it shoots out a Wonder Man construct except
Booster can't control it because Wonder Man's

493
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:47,000
immortal you know he can't be contained so he's
back like he usually comes back in the comics and in

494
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:54,020
his ionic form he grabs Booster in this bear hug
just crushing his suit's batteries and Booster's

495
00:48:54,020 --> 00:49:00,580
spine. So Wonder Man's the only one left standing
and he also has this like cool purple lantern ring

496
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:08,300
to boot. I'm sorry what the fuck just happened? I'm
saying that Wonder Man can't be trapped within

497
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:15,120
this green lantern ring. Whatever apparently
Wonder Man is now a violet lantern of love weird.

498
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:22,680
You know I think he'd go with that he's kind of a
pacifist anyway. I'm gonna say fuck that and he

499
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:28,000
actually could be contained in Booster's suit
because it's from the future. You don't know what

500
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:33,540
kind of technology it is. It could contain ionic
energy. Then why didn't it? I'm saying it did

501
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:38,800
though. I guess we'll leave it there. Yeah let's
leave it there. We'll see a scenario happens

502
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:45,040
either Booster Gold is able to contain Wonder
Man's ionic energy form within his power battery

503
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:52,180
or Wonder Man can't be contained and snaps Booster
Gold into. Let's go ahead and input the team stats,

504
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:58,660
run the simulations, and come back with a winner.
A.J .9K hit it. Inputting data, running

505
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:04,900
calculations, processing results, simulations
complete. Oh this was a close one. This is pretty

506
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:11,720
good. This is actually closer than the Justice
League versus Avengers duel that we did way back

507
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:16,980
when. That one was a little bit lopsided in favor of
the Justice League but these guys were actually

508
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:30,140
paired up pretty damn well. Yeah I mean I had the
highest win rate of around 85% but I also had the

509
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:37,120
weakest character surprisingly who turned out to
be Ice. She won less than 20%. Yeah my guys weren't

510
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:43,660
too far off of that like War Machine won about three
fourths of all of his matches and Tigro won just

511
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:50,780
under one fourth of all her matches. But regarding
the teams as a whole I gotta say the Justice League

512
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:56,680
International trounced the West Coast Avengers
when it came to the category of range. Like you have

513
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:02,920
a lot of Blasty guys on your side with Booster Gold
and Green Lantern of course Fire and Ice, Shazam

514
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:07,920
shoots lightning, Blue Beetle has his own
blaster, Long-Aided Mannequin stretch but like

515
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:14,820
guys on my side like Hercules and Tigra, Wonder
Man, and Quicksilver they barely had any range.

516
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:21,200
Yeah Wonder Man can shoot Ionic energy but it's
rare. It's super rare super rare. The best thing

517
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:27,480
your team had going for it was actually strength.
Yeah I mean we have heavy hitters like Hercules,

518
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:33,100
Wonder Man, War Machine, even Tigra can lift about
10 tons. She's like Spider-Man level strength

519
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:38,440
whereas on your side you know elongated man's not
that strong neither are Fire and Ice neither is

520
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:43,280
Blue Beetle so the West Coast Avengers were able to
lay the smack down in that regard. But were they

521
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:51,040
able to lay the smack down overall or were they the
ones who in fact got the smacking? Who do you think

522
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:56,500
came out on top? It's gonna be close but I'm rooting
for the Avengers because of course I am. Well I have

523
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:04,800
to say Instagram disagrees with you by a lot. 75% of
our poll takers voted in favor of the Justice

524
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:11,060
League International. Well that's
disappointing. That's life get used to it. It's

525
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:16,600
full of disappointment for Marvel fans. Let's see
if they're right. AG9K the results please. Here

526
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:24,380
you are sir. All right the winner in the team duel
between the Justice League International and the

527
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:34,700
West Coast Avengers is the West Coast Avengers.
West side? That's right. West side is the best

528
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:42,600
side. Out of all the simulated matches between the
teams the West Coast Avengers won 506 matches over

529
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:51,580
the JLI's 494. They only won 12 more than the
Justice League? This is a coin toss then. If by coin

530
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:56,980
toss you mean the Justice League got that shit
kicked out of them by the Avengers then yeah coin

531
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:07,060
toss. If this was any other day you guys would have
lost. But not this day. Not this day. This is sweet

532
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:13,160
justice for the Avengers. The West Coast branch
was able to redeem the Avengers brand. They're

533
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:19,060
reclaiming the trophy from the Justice League and
we're just running victory laps all around the

534
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:23,980
fucking Justice League. I cannot even fathom
these results. Like there's no way the Avengers

535
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:30,340
would ever beat the Justice League. This is. I'm
sorry they just did by 12 whole matches. Like I feel

536
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:35,420
like I'm in an alternate reality right now. It's
like what's going on? Well let's be frank you

537
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:40,020
needed to be taken down off of your high horse
Jonathan after watching the Superman movie. Well

538
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:45,500
it's fine I'll just get back up on it after I'm
gloating at the Fantastic Forest failure. Marvel

539
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:53,380
all day every day Justice League sucks. You suck
personally and I want you to remember this

540
00:53:53,380 --> 00:54:02,180
feeling. Already forgotten. But that does it for
this team dual AJ9K help close us out. Thanks for

Don't send Joe world and console combat. In our

545
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:37,540
next episode of course we will be reviewing the
latest MCU film to hit theaters the Fantastic Four

546
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:44,300
first steps. Not looking forward to it. Not hyped
at all. I hope it bombs and it's already projected

547
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:49,600
to open less than Superman which is freaking
awesome. No one can predict the future but that

548
00:54:49,600 --> 00:55:07,000
does it for this episode. We want to give a big
