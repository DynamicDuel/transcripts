1
00:00:03,277 --> 00:00:03,338
you

2
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,311
Hi, welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:27,331 --> 00:00:32,552
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters and stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:33,053 --> 00:00:37,594
I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm his twin brother,
Johnny DC. And in this episode, we're going

5
00:00:37,614 --> 00:00:43,096
to find out who'd win in a fight between Lobo
and Carnage. Now, Lobo is a big-time DC character,

6
00:00:43,156 --> 00:00:48,337
probably overdue for a duel on this podcast.
Yeah, yeah, he's the main man. But, you know,

7
00:00:48,357 --> 00:00:52,375
Carnage is overdue as well. Oh yeah, he's a
fascinating character, big time Spider-Man

8
00:00:52,395 --> 00:00:56,498
villain, and of course he's gonna be in a movie
coming out next week, Venom Let There Be Carnage.

9
00:00:56,538 --> 00:00:59,981
So we thought this was the perfect time to put
these two characters in a duel. They're both

10
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:05,525
hyper-violent, they both have insane healing
factors, they're both incredibly strong. I

11
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:09,407
think it's gonna be a pretty good matchup. Yeah,
it's gonna be crazy violent, it's gonna be

12
00:01:09,427 --> 00:01:13,010
good times. Before we get into that matchup
and run the simulations to see who would win,

13
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:16,532
we're gonna go over the comic book movie news
that have come out in the past week. Just a

14
00:01:16,552 --> 00:01:21,282
couple of trailers though for DC. We got our
first look at Netflix's The Sandman series,

15
00:01:21,722 --> 00:01:26,444
and we're gonna talk about the Injustice red
band trailer. As always, we list our segment

26
00:02:18,827 --> 00:02:24,290
give a big shout out to our newest patrons,
Hills and Noah B. Sweeney. Noah, in fact, was

27
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,492
one of our very first listeners way back in
the day in 2016 when we first started doing

28
00:02:28,532 --> 00:02:32,294
the show. So it's great to have him on board
as a patron now. Yeah guys, thanks for signing

29
00:02:32,374 --> 00:02:36,637
up. And I wanna give a quick disclaimer. If
I sound a little bit echoey, it's because I'm

30
00:02:36,717 --> 00:02:41,819
recording in a new space that hasn't been soundproofed
yet. So I think my voice is just bouncing all

31
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:45,501
over the walls here. So sorry to our listeners
for that. I'll be sure to get it taken care

32
00:02:45,561 --> 00:02:50,149
of. before the next time we record. But with
that out of the way, quick to the no prize.

33
00:02:52,271 --> 00:02:56,935
A no prize is an award that Marvel used to give
out up until the nineties to fans. Our version,

34
00:02:57,035 --> 00:03:02,099
the dynamic dual no prize, is a digital award
that we post on social media that I personally

35
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:07,383
draw for those who we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week's question

36
00:03:07,403 --> 00:03:12,467
tied into the first trailer we got for the upcoming
Hawkeye Disney Plus television series, which

37
00:03:12,487 --> 00:03:17,308
turned out to be a Christmas series. So we asked,
What's your favorite holiday and how would

38
00:03:17,328 --> 00:03:21,032
your favorite superheroes celebrate it? We got
a few honorable mentions, so let's go ahead

39
00:03:21,052 --> 00:03:26,639
and run down them as well as the no prize winner.
Our first honorable mention goes to DC Joe,

40
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:31,144
who said, What up guys, my favorite holiday
is Christmas and how would my favorite superhero

41
00:03:31,185 --> 00:03:35,583
celebrate it? Well, he would make sure that
everybody in Central City would have a present

42
00:03:35,643 --> 00:03:41,045
under the tree and probably stop at every house
to carol That's right the flash specifically

43
00:03:41,185 --> 00:03:45,967
Barry Allen And that's a pretty interesting
answer considering. I think Barry Allen is

44
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:51,069
canonically Jewish So, you know the fact that
he would spread so much christmas cheer is

45
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:56,811
really good on him Yeah, I mean if anybody has
the ability to play santa claus on christmas

46
00:03:56,891 --> 00:04:00,693
It's going to be the flash who can you know
run around the world in under a second, right?

47
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:04,936
He could definitely deliver all the toys to
all the boys and girls out there. Yeah, yeah,

48
00:04:04,976 --> 00:04:10,780
good answer. Our next honorable mention goes
to Jeff Miles Jr. who said, Hey, John and Joe,

49
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:17,244
it's Jeff Miles or Hefe Miles on Instagram.
My favorite holiday is definitely Christmas.

50
00:04:17,805 --> 00:04:23,509
It's time of joy. I get to travel home and see
my family and the superhero I would love to

51
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:30,013
see celebrate that is the Flash, man. He could
go all the way back to DC to see my family

52
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:35,168
real quick. you know, and he eats a lot because
he needs to keep up with his super, you know,

53
00:04:35,228 --> 00:04:41,573
superpowers. So definitely Flash Christmas.
All right. Yeah. Another Flash Christmas answer.

54
00:04:42,193 --> 00:04:46,356
Makes sense though. You know, again, not only
can he deliver all the toys to all the good

55
00:04:46,396 --> 00:04:51,079
boys and girls out there, he can also visit
his family real easily. Although, you know,

56
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:55,803
I mean, could have gone quick silver with this
one. He's fast. No, no, Flash. He has the red

57
00:04:55,843 --> 00:05:02,134
and gold costume. All he's missing is green
to be like super Christmasy infested. Our final

58
00:05:02,174 --> 00:05:07,035
honorable mention goes to Miggy Mathengian who
said, Hey guys, this is Miggy. My favorite

59
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:11,297
holiday is Christmas and my favorite superhero
Flash would celebrate it by making his annual

60
00:05:11,317 --> 00:05:15,258
visit to the Central City Orphanage where he
would continue his tradition of getting the

61
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:19,279
kids any toy they want and along the way he
would fight Ultra Humanite and teach him the

62
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,200
real meaning of Christmas. If you didn't realize,
this is all from the Justice League animated

63
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,601
episode, Comfort and Joy. Okay, so now all of
these Flash Christmas answers start to make

64
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:33,523
sense. Yeah, who sent the memo out there for
everybody to watch the Justice League animated

65
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:38,365
Christmas special? Because you all base your
answer off of the Flash celebrating Christmas

66
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:43,067
for some reason. I don't think I've seen that
episode, but it must have really struck a chord

67
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:47,789
with a lot of people who viewed it. Just like,
good feelings, good times. I love it. Quick

68
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:53,792
note, actually, everyone who answered the question
of the week this time gave a DC answer for

69
00:05:53,812 --> 00:05:58,830
their favorite hero. So, Marvel fans, you guys
need to show up. Yeah, where you guys at? Where

70
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:03,373
my boys at and my girls. So many Marvel heroes
out there celebrate the holidays, so it would

71
00:06:03,393 --> 00:06:07,456
have been great to hear about it. But we wanna
give a quick shout out to Dustin Balcom, who

72
00:06:07,476 --> 00:06:12,099
gave the answer of Christmas, but with Superman.
And it doesn't get more wholesome than that.

73
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:17,563
That was a great answer, thanks to Dustin Balcom.
The winner of this week's snow prize, I swear

74
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:26,149
to God, if it's flash Christmas, goes to Michael
Harald, who said. Hey guys, so personally,

75
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:31,827
my favorite's Christmas. But I think Halloween
would be a lot more fun to read a Harley Quinn

76
00:06:31,867 --> 00:06:37,148
story of. Just watch her picking on all the
people dressed up as superheroes and getting

77
00:06:37,168 --> 00:06:43,150
crazy on seeing people dressed up as the Joker.
And then going to a bar and heading on and

78
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:48,131
trying to pick herself up when she sees a bunch
of girls dressed up as Harley Quinn. I thought

79
00:06:48,151 --> 00:06:52,773
he was going to go Christmas for a second there,
but he saved it with Halloween. Nice twist!

80
00:06:52,993 --> 00:06:57,630
I'm sure it's a confusing time for any superhero
to see. Everyone dressed up like other superheroes.

81
00:06:59,551 --> 00:07:05,334
Or maybe even super villains. Like the Joker.
Maybe not so much as popular a costume choice

82
00:07:05,654 --> 00:07:10,356
in the actual DC universe considering he's real
there and everyone's terrified of him. But

83
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:14,017
you know, I can still see a lot of women dressing
up as Harley Quinn. It's like one of the most

84
00:07:14,057 --> 00:07:18,419
popular Halloween costumes in real life. That's
true. I'm sure Harley would love to see that.

85
00:07:18,559 --> 00:07:24,790
She'd be like, girls night out. And then subsequently
get most of them arrested. Yeah, exactly. Congrats

86
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:28,654
again to Michael Harreld for winning this week's
No Prize. If you the listener want a shot at

87
00:07:28,694 --> 00:07:32,397
winning your own No Prize, stay tuned to later
on this episode when we'll be asking another

88
00:07:32,497 --> 00:07:36,161
question of the week. And now that that's done,
on to the news!

89
00:07:41,806 --> 00:07:48,127
Okay, this past week Netflix had their own version
of like the DC fandom called Netflix's Tadum.

90
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:53,589
Total ripoff! Everyone rips off DC, whatever.
They debuted a whole bunch of trailers for

91
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:58,810
upcoming shows including The Sandman. This was
our first look at it and it's pretty brief,

92
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:05,372
it's really just a teaser, but it's like shot
by shot almost a scene from the first comic,

93
00:08:05,412 --> 00:08:10,654
like some of the opening pages. It was so cool
to see this brought into live action. We get

94
00:08:10,674 --> 00:08:14,936
to see Charles Dance from Game of Thrones play
Roderick Burgess, this occultist who's trying

95
00:08:14,956 --> 00:08:19,939
to summon Death, but he gets Dream instead,
and that's the setup for the entire series.

96
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:24,262
He doesn't play like the biggest role in the
comic, so I'm sure they're gonna beef up the

97
00:08:24,302 --> 00:08:29,825
role a little bit more considering it's fucking
Charles Dance, and he's a great actor, so I'm

98
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:33,887
curious to see what kind of changes they're
gonna make to the story. But so far, there

99
00:08:33,907 --> 00:08:38,746
are shots in this teaser that are like straight
panels from the comic. Like the overhead shot

100
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:44,067
of like the circle in which Dream is like laying
with his helmet and stuff like that. It's so

101
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:50,169
amazing. I wanted to weep the first time I saw
this. It's so glorious. Now what's with the

102
00:08:50,189 --> 00:08:55,290
helmet? What's the story behind that? Oh, it's
just a helmet that Morpheus created. I think

103
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:01,092
it was like an alien god skull that he created
it from. He imparted some of his power into

104
00:09:01,172 --> 00:09:06,853
that helmet as well as the ruby that you see
and the bag of sand that is also in the trailer.

105
00:09:06,873 --> 00:09:10,871
Interesting. Yeah, that's pretty cool looking.
Yeah, each of those artifacts get taken by

106
00:09:10,931 --> 00:09:16,033
Roderick Burgess. And like the first storyline
from the comic is Sandman trying to recollect

107
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:21,035
those pieces of himself, essentially to regain
more of his power because he was trapped for

108
00:09:21,075 --> 00:09:26,457
so long. And we get to see Tom Sturridge as
Dream trapped in this glass sphere within Roderick

109
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:31,939
Burgess's basement. It's so cool to see Dream
for the first time. He looks pretty spot on.

110
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:37,910
What's the actor's name? Tom Sturridge. He looks
great. Like almost a one to one. Translation

111
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:42,953
from the comics, you know, his eyes aren't all
black and his skin isn't as pale as it is in

112
00:09:42,973 --> 00:09:47,755
the comic But I love it. I think it totally
works. I think this is gonna be a hit show

113
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:52,358
for Netflix We have no idea when it's coming
out yet. They have not announced a release

114
00:09:52,378 --> 00:09:56,640
date It can't be soon enough though, because
I just once I saw this I was like I need this

115
00:09:56,741 --> 00:10:02,064
now If you haven't read Neil Gaiman's Sandman
series yet pick that shit up cuz that stuff

116
00:10:02,364 --> 00:10:07,458
is like among the best literary Works I've ever
read You and I recently did a bonus episode

117
00:10:07,478 --> 00:10:13,081
for our patrons where we listed our top 10 favorite
storylines And for me Sandman was number two

118
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:17,703
on that list like whatever you're reading right
now It's garbage compared to this just set

119
00:10:17,723 --> 00:10:22,765
that down pick this up. You won't regret it.
Are you gonna read it? I mean it's DC. I'm

120
00:10:22,785 --> 00:10:26,306
not gonna read it. Of course not. Why would
you even ask that question? Obviously? I'm

121
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:31,929
not gonna read it I'll read a series about spider-man's
villain the Sandman and call it good. Okay,

122
00:10:31,949 --> 00:10:39,857
I read Sandman guys. I read it In other DC trailer
news, we got the Red Band trailer for the animated

123
00:10:39,897 --> 00:10:45,300
film Injustice. We got a trailer a few weeks
ago for this film and I was kind of underwhelmed

124
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:51,445
by it. This was the trailer I wanted from the
get-go. Yeah, because it's violent. It actually

125
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:56,909
shows the hardcore death of the Joker and just
how crazy Superman gets. Oh yeah, totally.

126
00:10:56,969 --> 00:11:00,911
I mean, if you're not familiar with the comic
or the video game, you probably don't know

127
00:11:01,011 --> 00:11:06,766
yet what the Joker does to cause Superman. to
essentially rip his heart out, but it's crazy.

128
00:11:06,806 --> 00:11:11,488
It's brutal. And you know, it raises this great
like moral dilemma amongst the entire superhero

129
00:11:11,508 --> 00:11:16,649
community. And I love the way they set up this
whole ethical conflict amongst the superheroes

130
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:21,391
and the voiceover lines that we hear as we see
the different characters pop up on screen in

131
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:25,932
this trailer. Yeah, a lot of valid perspectives
here. I really like Green Lantern's approach

132
00:11:25,952 --> 00:11:30,493
where he's like Superman, you suffered this,
you know, unfathomable loss. You need time

133
00:11:30,513 --> 00:11:35,000
to process it. whatever decisions you're making
right now are going to be based in emotion

134
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,823
and grief and everything. You need time, a more
clear perspective. Yeah, yeah, we get to hear

135
00:11:39,863 --> 00:11:45,887
from Green Lantern, Shazam, Batman, Green Arrow,
Robin, Wonder Woman. Everyone is in this movie

136
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:49,990
and it looks like there's so much that goes
on in here. This feels like it's gonna be like

137
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,513
a three-hour movie. I have no idea how long
it's actually going to be, but there's a lot

138
00:11:54,533 --> 00:11:59,118
of stuff to get through in this film. It does
look like it's starting to shape up to be as

139
00:11:59,158 --> 00:12:03,720
good as Justice League Dark Apocalypse War,
which is like the best DC animated film of

140
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,241
all time, in my opinion. Yeah, that was really
good. We gave that a five-star review. If you

141
00:12:08,281 --> 00:12:12,402
haven't seen it yet, definitely check that out.
But I agree, this looks like it might be as

142
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:16,983
good as that film, just based on this trailer
alone. But we got to manage our expectations.

143
00:12:17,263 --> 00:12:21,705
Yes. Right now, we're just going to say it looks
okay. We'll see what happens, you know? Could

144
00:12:21,745 --> 00:12:25,502
be bad, could be good. You know what's almost
kind of bittersweet about this? is that this

145
00:12:25,542 --> 00:12:31,306
whole storyline sort of inspired Zack Snyder's
take on the DCEU, right? So it's like this

146
00:12:31,346 --> 00:12:35,389
is almost what we could have gotten if Warner
Brothers would have just let him do what he

147
00:12:35,429 --> 00:12:40,192
wanted to do and people like didn't freak out
over the direction he was heading. I would

148
00:12:40,212 --> 00:12:43,675
have loved to have seen this play out in live
action. It probably would have came across

149
00:12:43,735 --> 00:12:48,999
as kind of a rehash of Batman v Superman, but
I think it would have been a good story nonetheless.

150
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:53,522
Yeah, now we'll probably never ever get to see
that in live action. because of the whole kind

151
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:58,763
of BVS retread and who knows what's going on
with the future of the DCEU but I'm glad we

152
00:12:58,783 --> 00:13:03,144
at least get this storyline in this animated
form for people who haven't played the game

153
00:13:03,204 --> 00:13:07,726
or read the comics which they should do if you
haven't maybe, I don't know, maybe just watch

154
00:13:07,766 --> 00:13:11,747
the movie, we'll see we'll let you know yeah
we'll be reviewing this movie when it comes

155
00:13:11,847 --> 00:13:17,508
out next month in October but in regards to
Superman killing Joker during this trailer

156
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:22,188
and seeing Batman's just sort of horrified expression
about what just happened That brings us to

157
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,057
our question of the week.

158
00:13:27,698 --> 00:13:34,601
Should Batman have killed the Joker in the comics?
Why or why not? Yeah, this is a huge ethical

159
00:13:34,641 --> 00:13:39,264
question that Jonathan and I have gone back
and forth on for years now. Jonathan's like

160
00:13:39,304 --> 00:13:43,286
on the side of Batman where he's like, no, you
can't kill the Joker. And I'm like, no, Joker

161
00:13:43,626 --> 00:13:47,689
does too much shit. It's a crime not to kill
him. So we want to see where you guys stand.

162
00:13:48,149 --> 00:13:51,791
No right or wrong answers here, but let's hear
what you have to say. Record your answer at

163
00:13:56,682 --> 00:14:00,645
which will prompt you to leave us a voicemail.
Your message could be up to 30 seconds long,

164
00:14:00,985 --> 00:14:05,309
and don't forget to leave your name in case
we include you on the podcast. We'll pick our

165
00:14:05,349 --> 00:14:10,053
favorite answer and draw that person a dynamic
duel no prize that we'll post to social media.

166
00:14:10,453 --> 00:14:14,737
Be sure to answer before October 2nd. But I
think that does it for all the news for this

167
00:14:14,777 --> 00:14:18,761
episode, so let's go ahead and get into our
main event where we find out who'd win in a

168
00:14:18,801 --> 00:14:24,205
fight between the intergalactic bounty hunter
Lobo and the Spider-Man villain Carnage.

169
00:14:39,586 --> 00:14:44,870
All right, Lobo versus Carnage. This is gonna
be a bloody good episode. These guys are like

170
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:50,536
probably the most violent characters in the
respective DC and Marvel universes. Oh yeah.

171
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,339
That was the primary reason why we wanted to
put these two against each other because not

172
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:58,223
only do they have like similar power sets and
that they're both super strong and have super

173
00:14:58,263 --> 00:15:03,367
powerful healing factors, they both have a variety
of weapons at their disposal to take on their

174
00:15:03,407 --> 00:15:09,168
opponent. And they do so gleefully. Oh, totally.
Usually when people request matchups for Lobo,

175
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:13,952
they either say, you know, we should pit him
against Deadpool or Ghost Rider or Wolverine.

176
00:15:14,332 --> 00:15:19,277
Those characters have not only already gone
up against other, I think better matchups on

177
00:15:19,297 --> 00:15:24,641
this podcast. I personally think Lobo would
stomp all of them, maybe not Ghost Rider. Yeah,

178
00:15:24,661 --> 00:15:28,424
it was kind of hard to find a character in Marvel
that would be a good matchup for him, considering

179
00:15:28,444 --> 00:15:32,548
that we've already used Ghost Rider in a duel
against Etrichan. But I think Carnage has a

180
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:37,807
really good shot at beating this dude. You take
a shot at the main man, you better not miss.

181
00:15:38,327 --> 00:15:44,891
You fraggin' bastitch. Take it easy. Calm down.
Don't get into character just yet. All right,

182
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:49,374
all right, all right. So if you've never listened
to one of our dual episodes before, the way

183
00:15:49,414 --> 00:15:54,137
we determine a winner between these two characters
is by running 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations

184
00:15:54,457 --> 00:15:59,460
using their statistics. Now, a Monte Carlo simulation
is a probabilistic model used to determine

185
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:05,156
outcomes through random sampling. In our case,
it randomizes statistics along a normal distribution,

186
00:16:05,276 --> 00:16:09,640
which is a bell curve, as a way to simulate
the many variables that can occur during battle.

187
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:14,443
The stat parameters we use are based on the
official Marvel power grid, and we use that

188
00:16:14,463 --> 00:16:19,927
criteria to extrapolate the DC character's stats.
We've included some additional stat categories

189
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:25,592
of our own, such as range, damage potential,
versatility, and perception, in order to create

190
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:30,687
a more complete and robust simulation. And running
these 1000 simulations gives us a percentage

191
00:16:30,727 --> 00:16:34,909
of wins for each character, and we declare the
one with the higher percentage to be the ultimate

192
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:39,232
victor, considering that they're more likely
to win any given battle. No character ever

193
00:16:39,272 --> 00:16:43,855
wins 100% of the time, comics have shown that
there's always a way for Batman to defeat Superman,

194
00:16:44,315 --> 00:16:48,558
we feel our method falls in line with the precedents
that have been established in the comic book

195
00:16:48,578 --> 00:16:54,061
stories. And we use this method because it was
the least subjective, most unbiased way to

196
00:16:54,101 --> 00:16:58,878
determine who would win. Of course, we are both
heavily biased toward our respective allegiances,

197
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:04,280
and instead of debating these matches forever,
we just let the math decide for us. So there's

198
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:10,022
no fan votes here, and no relying on just feats.
Before we run the simulations though, we like

199
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:14,543
to break down each character's histories and
abilities before improvising a scenario on

200
00:17:14,563 --> 00:17:20,345
how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations we
run would play out beat for beat. And I think

201
00:17:20,385 --> 00:17:25,259
it's my turn to go first with my character's
backstory. So let me tell you all about the

202
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:32,085
main man, Lobo. Now Lobo, whose name roughly
translates to one who devours your entrails

203
00:17:32,105 --> 00:17:38,530
and thoroughly enjoys it, was born on the peaceful
utopian planet of Zarnia, whose citizens were

204
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:44,556
immortal enlightened pacifists. When Lobo was
born, he bit off the nurse's fingers, and from

205
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:50,341
that point onward, remained a sociopathic blight
on the planet that had forgotten how to punish

206
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:55,815
or discipline. literally letting Lobo get away
with murder. For all of their dedication to

207
00:17:55,875 --> 00:18:01,598
science, the Zarnians had no explanation for
Lobo's behavior other than demonic possession,

208
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:06,880
though in reality, Lobo was the result of the
universe trying to balance millennia's worth

209
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:13,283
of good-natured behavior by the Zarnians. Intellectually
gifted from a young age, Lobo developed an

210
00:18:13,403 --> 00:18:19,005
airborne parasitic virus as a science project
that quickly yet painfully killed everyone

211
00:18:19,085 --> 00:18:24,665
else on his planet. making him the last of his
race. He gave himself an A on the project,

212
00:18:25,065 --> 00:18:29,889
and eventually left the barren planet to travel
the cosmos, using his innate ability to track

213
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:35,654
anything or anyone to become the universe's
most feared bounty hunter. During the Citadel

214
00:18:35,694 --> 00:18:42,180
Wars, the leader of the Citadel, an intergalactic
fascist empire, hired Lobo to kidnap Callista,

215
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:47,704
a princess of the planet Euphorix and a member
of a space-faring team of freedom fighters

216
00:18:47,784 --> 00:18:53,696
known as the Omega Men. Lobo successfully captured
her, but was later hired by Calista's husband,

217
00:18:53,856 --> 00:18:59,140
Primus, the leader of the Omega Men, to free
many of the Citadel's prisoners, including

218
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:05,564
Calista. Lobo agreed, and killed the leader
of the Citadel in the process. Lobo, whose

219
00:19:05,705 --> 00:19:11,528
only love in life is his nigh-extinct space
dolphin pets, was later paid by an intergalactic

220
00:19:11,588 --> 00:19:15,931
villain named Manga Khan in Dolphin Treats to
kill the Justice League

221
00:19:19,214 --> 00:19:24,575
until Manga Khan canceled his contract. When
one of Lobo's space dolphins was killed, Lobo

222
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:31,537
tracked the killer to Legion's space territory.
Legion's leader, Vildrax II, promised to protect

223
00:19:31,597 --> 00:19:36,718
the space dolphins if Lobo joined his Legion
government organization, which Lobo agreed

224
00:19:36,738 --> 00:19:42,600
to do and helped bring down the drug cartel
planet of Cairn, seemingly dying in the ordeal.

225
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:48,101
Lobo survived, however, much to his Legion teammates'
dismay as they often fought with the bounty

226
00:19:48,141 --> 00:19:53,809
hunter and were left with broken bones as a
result. A man of honor, however, Lobo remained

227
00:19:53,869 --> 00:19:59,013
true to his pact with Rill Trox until Lobo took
an opportunity to kill him to get out of the

228
00:19:59,053 --> 00:20:05,078
contract, though it was later revealed that
Lobo killed merely a clone of Rill. While at

229
00:20:05,178 --> 00:20:11,683
an intergalactic space bar, Lobo drunkenly accepted
a bet that he couldn't kill Superman, so Lobo

230
00:20:11,723 --> 00:20:16,738
traveled to Earth and nearly killed the Man
of Steel. forcing Superman to fake his own

231
00:20:16,818 --> 00:20:22,841
death just so Lobo would believe he'd made good
on his bet. At one point, Manga Khan hired

232
00:20:22,881 --> 00:20:28,344
Lobo to capture the villain, Dispero, whom Lobo
tracked to Earth. Dispero had been running

233
00:20:28,424 --> 00:20:32,746
rampant and was in the midst of battling the
Justice League International and Justice League

234
00:20:32,826 --> 00:20:38,948
Europe teams when Lobo interfered, much to the
dismay of the leagues. Eventually, Lobo joined

235
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:43,883
forces with the leagues to bring Dispero down.
a team up that ended up leveling Manhattan's

236
00:20:43,923 --> 00:20:48,826
Times Square in the ensuing battle, though Manga
Khan paid for all of the damages to the city

237
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:54,609
once Lobo completed his job. During the death
and return of Superman's storylines, Lobo had

238
00:20:54,709 --> 00:21:00,133
overheard that Superman had come back from the
dead. Still believing he had killed him, Lobo

239
00:21:00,193 --> 00:21:04,836
returned to Earth for a rematch against the
Man of Steel, and they eventually battled in

240
00:21:04,936 --> 00:21:10,155
space, where Superman ended up teaming up with
Lobo to save him from a group of robotic bounty

241
00:21:10,175 --> 00:21:15,420
hunters that they had accidentally crashed into
during their battle. Because Superman had helped

242
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:20,965
him, Lobo decided that they didn't need to fight
to the death. Not long after, a scandalous

243
00:21:21,025 --> 00:21:26,469
tell-all book about Lobo's life became a bestseller
among numerous galaxies, spreading his already

244
00:21:26,529 --> 00:21:31,354
vile reputation. Not that Lobo cared, but many
groups across the galaxy wanted the book's

245
00:21:31,454 --> 00:21:37,739
author dead, including the Legion of Decency,
the Dune-Din Police SWAT team, a union of intergalactic

246
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:42,662
truckers, basically anyone with any kind of
vendetta against Lobo, with the assumption

247
00:21:42,702 --> 00:21:48,266
that the author was close to him. Brill Drox
II hired Lobo to bring in the author alive

248
00:21:48,386 --> 00:21:54,230
and unharmed, and it wasn't long before Lobo
realized the book's author was his fourth grade

249
00:21:54,330 --> 00:22:00,494
teacher, Mrs. Trib, whom he thought he had killed.
Wanting nothing more than to kill her outright,

250
00:22:00,774 --> 00:22:08,534
but a man of his word, Lobo was forced to across
galaxies while protecting her from untold numbers

251
00:22:08,574 --> 00:22:15,096
of assassins. After killing entire planets full
of people, Lobo finally got Mrs. Trib to drill

252
00:22:15,116 --> 00:22:21,818
Drox safely, immediately after which he killed
her, making himself, once again, the last Zarnian

253
00:22:21,898 --> 00:22:27,100
in the universe. What a dick. He's always kind
of felt like he was one of a kind, and he makes

254
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,221
sure that he is. Some time after killing Santa
Claus on a contract set by the Easter Bunny,

255
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:38,049
Lobo found religion. and took a vow of nonviolence
when he became the Archbishop of the first

256
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:43,474
celestial church of the Triple Fish God. Tasked
with bringing the Fish God the powerful weapon

257
00:22:43,774 --> 00:22:49,139
known as the Emerald Eye of Ekron, during his
mission, Lobo ran into Animal Man, Starfire,

258
00:22:49,459 --> 00:22:53,843
and Adam Strange, the latter two of whom you
can learn more about in their respective duel

259
00:22:53,883 --> 00:22:58,688
episodes. Though helping them fend off villains
such as Devil Lance and Lady Sticks proved

260
00:22:58,808 --> 00:23:03,908
difficult without resorting to violence, Lobo
eventually brought the Emerald Eye to the Fish

261
00:23:03,928 --> 00:23:09,353
God, which turned out to be the only weapon
that could kill it. Seeing Lobo as a valuable

262
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:14,677
asset, the Fish God graciously released Lobo
from his vow of nonviolence, only to then be

263
00:23:14,717 --> 00:23:21,223
killed by Lobo with the Emerald Eye, after which
Lobo took over the church. Lobo finally died

264
00:23:21,283 --> 00:23:26,147
during a battle on Apocalypse and was sent to
Hell, where he enjoyed the torture and his

265
00:23:26,207 --> 00:23:32,495
life's sins fueled a massive region of the underworld.
Imprisoned by the Archdemon Neron, Lobo was

266
00:23:32,535 --> 00:23:37,497
set free by Etrigan the Demon, who you can learn
more about in our Etrigan vs. Ghost Rider episode.

267
00:23:37,937 --> 00:23:43,299
Lobo re-emerged in the Land of the Living, where
he was given a Red Lantern Power Ring, though

268
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:47,741
he wore it as a trophy around his neck, rather
than use it and be bound to the Red Lantern

269
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:53,644
Core. When Lobo's church ran into financial
trouble, Lobo was forced to work for Real Drox

270
00:23:53,744 --> 00:23:58,826
once again, whom he helped defeat the humanoid
form of Starro the Conqueror. who you can learn

271
00:23:58,866 --> 00:24:05,412
more about in our Starro vs. Fing Fang Fum episode.
In post-Flashpoint continuity, a new, slender,

272
00:24:05,672 --> 00:24:11,738
pretty boy version of Lobo was introduced. It
was revealed that the heavyset, obnoxious biker

273
00:24:11,778 --> 00:24:17,683
version of Lobo was apparently an imposter,
and the quote-unquote real Lobo was really

274
00:24:17,743 --> 00:24:24,209
a former bodyguard to the Zarnian royal family,
who bathed in blood pools that bestowed regenerative

275
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:29,300
abilities. When one of the blood pools became
contaminated with a quickly spreading virus,

276
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:35,344
real Lobo was forced to kill everyone on his
planet in an act of mercy. This supposedly

277
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:40,748
real version of Lobo didn't last long, however,
and the former version was soon revealed to

278
00:24:40,768 --> 00:24:46,272
be a member of Amanda Waller's original Suicide
Squad team, now under the mind control of Maxwell

279
00:24:46,332 --> 00:24:51,296
Lord. Lobo managed to break free of Maxwell
Lord's control, however, after Batman managed

280
00:24:51,336 --> 00:24:56,339
to implant a bomb in Lobo's head and blow it
up. It was around this time that Lobo learned

281
00:24:56,359 --> 00:25:01,584
he had a half-Zarnean daughter who was raised
on Earth named Crush, who had become a member

282
00:25:01,684 --> 00:25:06,849
of the Teen Titans. So of course he tried to
kill her. Crush was able to stop Lobo from

283
00:25:06,889 --> 00:25:12,774
doing so, however, and she and her team imprisoned
him on the moon. Not long after, Lobo was imprisoned

284
00:25:12,854 --> 00:25:17,458
in real space jail, but Crush broke him out,
and the two are currently trying to work things

285
00:25:17,618 --> 00:25:24,163
out. That's Lobo's history so far. Now, powers-wise,
Lobo possesses the natural superhuman durability

286
00:25:24,263 --> 00:25:31,187
and strength of a Zarnian, capable of lifting
over 100 tons. He has uncanny stamina and rapid

287
00:25:31,247 --> 00:25:36,910
regeneration, allowing him to continue fighting
even as a charred skeleton or regrowing his

288
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:42,313
entire body from a single drop of blood. On
occasion, clones of himself can grow from his

289
00:25:42,373 --> 00:25:47,776
blood, usually resulting in an all-out brawl
to prove who's the real Lobo. He has enhanced

290
00:25:47,856 --> 00:25:53,311
senses of hearing, smell, and vision. as well
as the innate ability to track targets across

291
00:25:53,331 --> 00:25:58,853
the universe, the time stream, and even other
dimensions. He's surprisingly a scientific

292
00:25:58,913 --> 00:26:05,216
genius, having once pieced together a planet-destroying
cannon from trash, and he can speak over 17,000

293
00:26:05,736 --> 00:26:11,658
languages. He carries numerous gadgets and weapons
on him, most notably a chain hook he keeps

294
00:26:11,718 --> 00:26:19,101
wrapped around his wrist, frag grenades, knives,
laser guns, and shotguns. He also has his space

295
00:26:19,141 --> 00:26:26,723
hog. A customized Spaz Frag 666 that has a miniaturized
17L powerplant with a 3x turbo and full hands-off

296
00:26:26,763 --> 00:26:32,308
facility, which he can summon with a whistle
from across the universe. He's also immortal,

297
00:26:32,568 --> 00:26:37,493
having been banned from both heaven and hell.
And that's Lobo. Is he gonna have his space

298
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:41,836
hog during this fight? Even if he doesn't, I'm
pretty sure he could summon it. He's equipped

299
00:26:41,856 --> 00:26:48,698
to this thing with like, all kinds of like trans-dimensional
and time-traveling tech, so. Yes. I guess it

300
00:26:48,718 --> 00:26:53,059
would be only fair considering that Ghost Rider
did get his hell cycle in his battle with Edrigan.

301
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:58,261
Yeah, yeah. He's such a joke of a character
though, you know? Uh, yeah, you know, there's

302
00:26:58,301 --> 00:27:02,142
occasional fourth wall breaking and stuff with
him. He's kind of like Deadpool in that regard,

303
00:27:02,442 --> 00:27:05,863
but I think that's why people like him because
he's kind of subversive, you know? He's not

304
00:27:05,903 --> 00:27:12,445
afraid to tell fanboys to like, bite me. So
he carries really powerful grenades. Yeah,

305
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:16,906
when I say they're a frag grenade... I don't
mean like a fragmentation grenade, I mean like

306
00:27:16,946 --> 00:27:23,428
a frag you, you fraggin' bastitch grenade, you
know? Alright, well, Carnage is gonna have

307
00:27:23,448 --> 00:27:27,689
to find a way to deal with those, but let me
go ahead and tell you all about him. The Carnage

308
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:32,851
symbiote is part of an alien race of parasitic
beings that attach to other life forms for

309
00:27:32,891 --> 00:27:39,172
survival and grant their hosts immense power.
As a species, the Clintar were created in the

310
00:27:39,252 --> 00:27:45,247
universe's infancy by a primordial deity named
Null. to use as a biological weapon against

311
00:27:45,387 --> 00:27:51,190
Celestials and their creations throughout the
cosmos. Null desired to dominate all other

312
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:56,753
lifeforms by exerting his influence over those
assimilated by the Klintar symbiotes. Over

313
00:27:56,773 --> 00:28:01,216
the millennia, the symbiotes evolved to become
more sentient and they rebelled against their

314
00:28:01,256 --> 00:28:07,219
creator to live a more peaceful existence. The
Klintar tried to bond only with peaceful beings

315
00:28:07,499 --> 00:28:12,434
that were pure of heart since attaching themselves
to hateful and violent hosts would corrupt

316
00:28:12,474 --> 00:28:18,337
them and exacerbate their hosts' negative aspects.
The corrupted symbiotes would become vulnerable

317
00:28:18,377 --> 00:28:23,460
to extreme heat and sonic energies and were
exiled and cut off from the Klyntar hive mind.

318
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,263
Once such corrupted symbiote found its way to
Earth while attached to the hero Spider-Man

319
00:28:28,683 --> 00:28:32,005
after one of his adventures in space, which
you can learn more about in our Blue Beetle

320
00:28:32,025 --> 00:28:37,348
vs Spider-Man Duel episode. Spider-Man managed
to rid himself of the symbiote and it attached

321
00:28:37,408 --> 00:28:42,550
itself to Eddie Brock, a ruined investigative
journalist. He had recently been discredited

322
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:48,051
by Spider-Man and had a hatred for the webslinger.
The two became Venom, one of Spider-Man's most

323
00:28:48,131 --> 00:28:53,073
fearsome and powerful villains, whom you can
learn more about in our Clayface vs Venom duel.

324
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:58,474
Spider-Man and Venom fought several times, with
Eddie Brock landing in Riker's Island Prison,

325
00:28:58,834 --> 00:29:04,676
separated from the symbiote for a time. Eddie's
cellmate was a notorious sociopathic serial

326
00:29:04,716 --> 00:29:10,918
killer named Cletus Kasady, who was serving
11 consecutive life sentences for murder. While

327
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:17,063
in prison, Eddie learned about Cletus' disturbing
history. Reportedly, Cletus was born in the

328
00:29:17,103 --> 00:29:22,788
Ravencroft Institute to an unknown mother with
paranoid schizophrenia. She died shortly after

329
00:29:22,808 --> 00:29:27,672
his birth, and Cletus was sent to live with
his grandmother. As a child, he killed the

330
00:29:27,752 --> 00:29:32,496
elderly woman by pushing her down a flight of
stairs, and was subsequently raised by foster

331
00:29:32,516 --> 00:29:39,081
parents Roscoe and Louise. Troubled and psychotic,
Cletus tormented his foster family with bizarre

332
00:29:39,101 --> 00:29:45,629
behavior. eventually killing the family dog.
Yikes. Driven mad, his foster mom Louise tried

333
00:29:45,669 --> 00:29:50,631
to kill Cletus, and Roscoe tried to stop her,
accidentally killing his wife in the process.

334
00:29:51,172 --> 00:29:56,535
During the murder trial, Cletus claimed Roscoe
killed Louise for no reason, resulting in his

335
00:29:56,575 --> 00:30:02,878
foster father's death via electric chair. DANG.
As a teen, Cletus was sent to the St. Estes

336
00:30:02,898 --> 00:30:08,041
Home for Boys orphanage where he was bullied
for his eccentric behavior. He fell in love

337
00:30:08,081 --> 00:30:12,499
with a girl he had met. and when she rejected
him, he pushed her in front of an oncoming

338
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:18,603
school bus. Cletus ended up fleeing the orphanage
and setting it on fire, killing the disciplinarian

339
00:30:18,643 --> 00:30:24,666
staff and the other orphan boys in the process.
Dude, this kid sucks! He adopted the philosophy

340
00:30:24,706 --> 00:30:29,289
that laws were only words, and that by murdering
others, he was freeing them from the chaos

341
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:34,492
and meaninglessness of life. Cletus then went
on a killing spree, murdering nearly a dozen

342
00:30:34,532 --> 00:30:39,118
more people and experimenting with cannibalism.
before authorities finally caught up and sent

343
00:30:39,138 --> 00:30:44,601
him to Rikers. Dude, ugh, this is hard. It's
like, let's think up the most fucked up character

344
00:30:44,641 --> 00:30:48,422
we could possibly think up. Yeah, he's more
fucked up than Lobo. I'll say that. I mean,

345
00:30:48,462 --> 00:30:54,025
Lobo killed Santa Claus. There's also that.
That's true. Now while in Rikers, Cletus tried

346
00:30:54,045 --> 00:30:59,367
to convert Eddie Brock to his nihilistic life
philosophy, though Cletus disgusted Brock and

347
00:30:59,407 --> 00:31:04,289
was dismissed by him. When Cletus was about
to stab Eddie with the shiv he created, the

348
00:31:04,349 --> 00:31:10,033
venom symbiote- broke into their cell and rebonded
with Eddie. As Venom escaped the prison, the

349
00:31:10,073 --> 00:31:15,938
symbiote left behind an asexually reproduced
spawn that bonded onto Cletus. Newly formed

350
00:31:15,978 --> 00:31:21,323
and corrupted beyond reason, the new symbiote
called itself Carnage and empowered Cletus

351
00:31:21,403 --> 00:31:26,407
far beyond the powers of Venom or Spider-Man.
He killed his prison guard by pulling him through

352
00:31:26,447 --> 00:31:31,671
his cell bars and escaped to randomly kill more
victims. Spider-Man and Venom had

353
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:40,493
using Madison Square Garden's PA system to produce
sonic waves that seemingly destroyed the symbiote.

354
00:31:40,873 --> 00:31:45,716
Cletus was captured and taken to the asylum
of his birth, the Ravencroft Institute for

355
00:31:45,736 --> 00:31:51,379
the Criminally Insane. Unbeknownst to anyone,
however, the carnage symbiote had bonded itself

356
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:56,182
to Cletus' blood through a cut in his hand at
their first encounter, giving the creature

357
00:31:56,242 --> 00:32:01,785
his red appearance. Cletus escaped Ravencroft
alongside several other villains, including

358
00:32:01,885 --> 00:32:07,120
a mutant named Shriek, who could produce sonic
waves that drive people insane. The pair went

359
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:12,704
on a killing spree, causing a group of New Yorkers
to turn on each other violently. It took Spider-Man,

360
00:32:12,985 --> 00:32:17,988
Venom, Black Cat, and the Avengers combined
might to stop the villains, and Cletus was

361
00:32:18,028 --> 00:32:24,213
imprisoned again in a specialized cell back
at Ravencroft. Eventually, Venom confronted

362
00:32:24,253 --> 00:32:29,617
Cletus at the asylum, pulled the symbiote from
Cletus's body, and devoured it, destroying

363
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:35,212
Carnage. Distraught, Cletus escaped Ravencroft
and painted his body red, claiming to still

364
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:40,614
have the symbiote and going on another murderous
rampage. There was some truth to that as remnants

365
00:32:40,654 --> 00:32:46,097
of Carnage did remain in his bloodstream, and
it directed him to another symbiote and Cletus

366
00:32:46,157 --> 00:32:51,699
bonded with this new Klyntar alien, absorbing
and assimilating it into his being. After a

367
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:57,234
battle with Venom, Cletus landed in The Raft,
a prison for superpowered people. When the

368
00:32:57,274 --> 00:33:01,535
Spider-Man villain Electro initiated a full-on
prison break from the Raft, which you can learn

369
00:33:01,555 --> 00:33:07,398
more about in our Flash vs Electro duel, the
Sentry pulled Carnage out into space and ripped

370
00:33:07,418 --> 00:33:13,400
him in half. The symbiote kept Cletus' body
alive as the two halves orbited Earth for a

371
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:18,683
time. He eventually crashed into a satellite
owned by one of Tony Stark's rivals, Michael

372
00:33:18,723 --> 00:33:23,945
Hall, who acquired the pair and kept Cletus
in stasis while incorporating the symbiote

373
00:33:24,005 --> 00:33:30,871
into his Cletus escaped his confinement and
rejoined with Carnage, battling both Spider-Man

374
00:33:31,132 --> 00:33:36,434
and Iron-Man via the symbiote-powered armor,
before being defeated. At one point, Cletus

375
00:33:36,454 --> 00:33:42,637
was kidnapped by a cult that worshipped Null,
the primordial deity and creator of the symbiotes.

376
00:33:43,137 --> 00:33:48,299
They grafted a sample of the original symbiote,
called Grendel, onto him, hoping to turn him

377
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:53,621
into a submissive vessel for Null. Carnage instead
assimilated the Grendel symbiote, increasing

378
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:58,781
his power and he began infecting the homeless
population with symbiotic brain worms to serve

379
00:33:58,881 --> 00:34:03,925
as his personal army. Eugh! They helped bring
him anyone who had ever bonded with symbio

380
00:34:04,025 --> 00:34:09,390
over the years so Carnage could consume their
remnant power. Increasing his might, Carnage

381
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:15,695
sprouted horns and wings, transforming into
Dark Carnage. Venom defeated Dark Carnage by

382
00:34:15,755 --> 00:34:20,900
manifesting a necro sword similar to the Thor
villain, Gore, and slicing Dark Carnage in

383
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:27,384
two, destroying Cletus's body. The Grendel Carnage
symbiote then bonded to Venom to make him the

384
00:34:27,505 --> 00:34:32,809
new vessel for Null. However, the Venom symbiote
overcame their merger and was powerful enough

385
00:34:32,849 --> 00:34:38,393
to destroy Null once and for all. Venom then
became the new ruler of the Klintar Hivemind

386
00:34:38,773 --> 00:34:44,097
and banished the Carnage symbiote to the ocean's
depths. However, remnants of Cletus's mind

387
00:34:44,217 --> 00:34:49,541
survived within the symbiote just as the symbiote
had survived in Cletus so many times before.

388
00:34:49,986 --> 00:34:55,328
Cletus's mind awoke, now intent on creating
a rival symbiote hive. And that's his history.

389
00:34:55,788 --> 00:35:00,650
Powers-wise, Carnage is one of the most dangerous
and powerful Klyntar symbiotes to have ever

390
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:06,912
existed. He's stronger than Venom and Spider-Man
combined, able to lift around 80 tons. His

391
00:35:06,952 --> 00:35:13,195
fluidic biomass can extend tentacles and tendrils
or form into hardened shapes such as spikes,

392
00:35:13,315 --> 00:35:18,737
blades, shields, and clubs. He can even shoot
thin but durable strands of his own mass to

393
00:35:18,777 --> 00:35:24,044
ensnare an opponent. Oh, like webbing? Yeah,
kind of. Carnage can shapeshift to render different

394
00:35:24,185 --> 00:35:29,268
outer appearances and blend into his surroundings
like a chameleon. He's extremely durable, able

395
00:35:29,288 --> 00:35:35,293
to negate the impacts of most physical attacks
up to gunfire, and mostly resist stronger attacks.

396
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:40,656
Carnage physically and telepathically bonded
with Cletus to provide a 360-degree view of

397
00:35:40,676 --> 00:35:45,820
his surroundings, making it difficult to surprise
attack him. The symbiote is in fact bonded

398
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:50,459
to Cletus at the cellular level, granting him
a powerful regenerative healing factor that

399
00:35:50,499 --> 00:35:55,362
makes him nearly impossible to kill and able
to eventually come back if even the smallest

400
00:35:55,402 --> 00:36:00,625
bit of the symbiote remains. Because of this
unique bonding, Carnage can also manipulate

401
00:36:00,645 --> 00:36:06,108
his body into non-humanoid shapes, and he can
stretch, slingshot, and swing to travel large

402
00:36:06,148 --> 00:36:10,971
distances quickly. Carnage has the ability to
infect and possess other beings with this symbiote

403
00:36:11,311 --> 00:36:16,290
and has limited telepathic control over them.
Despite his powers, Carnage is vulnerable to

404
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:21,811
fire and sonic energies. I didn't realize Carnage
was that strong. That's pretty crazy. Yeah,

405
00:36:21,831 --> 00:36:25,552
80 tons is no joke. You know, that's like along
the lines of like Captain Marvel and Namor

406
00:36:25,572 --> 00:36:29,874
the Submariner. So he's strong, he could shape
shift, he could basically have like any weapon

407
00:36:29,914 --> 00:36:33,815
he wants to. I think this is gonna be a pretty
good match. Yeah, I'm excited to get into the

408
00:36:33,855 --> 00:36:37,376
speculation, so let's go ahead and do that.
And now that we've got their histories and

409
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:41,877
abilities out of the way, let's talk about how
one of the 1,000 simulated matches will go.

410
00:36:42,277 --> 00:36:47,308
The winner is determined by simulations. not
our speculation, but it is fun to imagine how

411
00:36:47,348 --> 00:36:51,772
this fight could play out. And we don't set
any rules for this match, other than the characters

412
00:36:51,812 --> 00:36:55,795
don't know anything about each other going in,
except that the other character is a threat

413
00:36:56,055 --> 00:37:01,340
that needs to be put down. And we say that they
start off about 50 meters apart, in an environment

414
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:06,304
that has no bearing on the match itself, because
we don't take stats for the environment. Plus

415
00:37:06,344 --> 00:37:10,728
certain characters have advantages in some environments
over others, and we want these characters to

416
00:37:10,768 --> 00:37:15,686
win on their own merits. So let's get into it.
Lobo and Carnage meet on the battlefield. Who

417
00:37:15,726 --> 00:37:20,247
goes first? Lobo's gonna start this one, and
he's just gonna start by pulling out this sod

418
00:37:20,287 --> 00:37:26,569
off laser shotgun, and just blasts Carnage with
it. A shotgun at that range? It's a laser shotgun.

419
00:37:27,129 --> 00:37:32,771
Lasers. All right, well, Carnage is gonna throw
up like this biomass shield in front of him,

420
00:37:33,311 --> 00:37:37,212
and you know, it's not gonna protect against
lasers too well, but it'll provide him some

421
00:37:37,272 --> 00:37:42,963
cover, as with his non-shield hand, he's gonna
reach out. and he's gonna like fling a large

422
00:37:43,043 --> 00:37:48,787
tendril at Lobo's gun and just like snap it
away from Lobo's grasp and tossing it like

423
00:37:48,927 --> 00:37:54,631
Hundreds of meters away. What? Okay, Lobo loved
that gun So he's pissed and he's just gonna

424
00:37:54,951 --> 00:38:00,695
charge at carnage just swinging his like chained
hook and as he gets close He's gonna hurl that

425
00:38:00,715 --> 00:38:06,520
thing right into carnage's torso hooking into
Cletus Kasady's spinal column He's just gonna

426
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:12,367
yank that sucker right out except like Carnage,
his body is like, you know, it's not normal.

427
00:38:12,727 --> 00:38:20,032
It's like a sinewy, fluidic mass. So as Lobo
tries to yank out Carnage's spine, Carnage's

428
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:25,395
whole body is gonna go with the spine, just
hurtling towards Lobo. And as he's getting

429
00:38:25,435 --> 00:38:29,737
yanked toward him, he's gonna form his arms
into these giant, like, sides that just reach

430
00:38:29,797 --> 00:38:34,060
out and, like, chop off both of Lobo's arms
right at the shoulders. And he just starts

431
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:41,359
dismembering Lobo. Dang! All right, so... As
Lobo is being cut into, he's gonna whistle,

432
00:38:41,379 --> 00:38:46,920
alright? And his space hog just comes in from
like nowhere, just flying right into Carnage

433
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:51,741
and just carrying him off into the distance,
which gives Lobo enough time to get to his

434
00:38:51,901 --> 00:38:56,663
arms, which he reattaches. And then Lobo's gonna
whistle again, and his bike is gonna bring

435
00:38:56,683 --> 00:39:02,464
back Carnage. So this is like a hover bike,
right? Yeah, yeah. Alright, so when Lobo calls

436
00:39:02,504 --> 00:39:08,431
his bike back to him to bring Carnage back,
the bike is... not gonna look like how he remembers

437
00:39:08,491 --> 00:39:14,276
it. It's gonna be red with black streaks. What?
And it's gonna have this big smiling, sharp,

438
00:39:14,356 --> 00:39:18,920
toothy grin in the front where the grill is
because Carnage will have wrapped himself around

439
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,844
this bike and now he's in control of it. And
as it comes back, he's gonna steer it right

440
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:27,628
into Lobo and it's gonna crash into him right
as Carnage detaches from the bike and leaps

441
00:39:27,668 --> 00:39:33,733
away. That's like some Freddy Krueger shit right
there. Lobo did not appreciate that. It's like.

442
00:39:34,046 --> 00:39:39,668
Lowe gets plowed by his own bike, but he's also
super durable and he controls the bike mentally,

443
00:39:39,688 --> 00:39:44,690
right? So as he's like hurtling through the
air with it He's just gonna climb on to it

444
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:48,652
as it's traveling midair and he's just gonna
take control, right? So he's gonna steer the

445
00:39:48,692 --> 00:39:53,854
bike towards carnage before slamming on the
brakes and just launching himself Right into

446
00:39:53,914 --> 00:39:58,576
carnage tackling him onto the ground and just
using his fists to pound him right into like

447
00:39:58,936 --> 00:40:07,089
marinara sauce Alright, well, okay, so Lobo,
he's like punching Carnage in the face, repeatedly

448
00:40:07,129 --> 00:40:12,372
turning it to mush, but Carnage is just gonna
morph his body so that his head is like on

449
00:40:12,413 --> 00:40:17,476
the side of his body, instead of where his head
normally was. So Lobo is just punching the

450
00:40:17,496 --> 00:40:22,720
ground. And then Carnage, while he's underneath
Lobo, he's gonna like protrude all these spikes

451
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:27,563
out of his body, like he's a porcupine or a
hedgehog or something. And Lobo is just gonna

452
00:40:27,583 --> 00:40:32,163
get impaled, like a thousand spikes all over
his body. And he's going to be like unable

453
00:40:32,203 --> 00:40:39,248
to move just suspended by all these needles.
Huh. So every part of Lobo's body is like impaled.

454
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:46,314
Except for his hand. All right. Which is holding
surprise a frag grenade. All right. So that

455
00:40:46,334 --> 00:40:50,678
was just going to like thumb out the pin and
let the grenade drop like right onto carnage.

456
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:57,504
Boom. So like Lobo, he gets blown far away.
But carnage, he's reduced to like a few writhing

457
00:40:57,544 --> 00:41:03,513
tendrils. That's pretty good. But. You know
what? Carnage only needs a few writhing tendrils

458
00:41:03,533 --> 00:41:09,898
to still survive. These tendrils crawl toward
each other and they join together, growing

459
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:15,783
and reforming a sinewy shape that eventually
becomes humanoid again. So Carnage is back,

460
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:21,348
and he's pissed. Okay, so in all that time it
takes Carnage to heal, you know, Lobo has also

461
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:25,971
recovered. And he's coming back into the fray
on his bike, alright? And by the way, like,

462
00:41:25,991 --> 00:41:30,603
this whole ordeal, this whole matchup against
Carnage... Lobo is loving it. Like he's having

463
00:41:30,663 --> 00:41:34,645
the time of his life, right? Even with like
being impaled and stuff like that. So like

464
00:41:34,945 --> 00:41:39,207
the only thing that's gonna make this better
is like blasting some heavy metal music on

465
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:43,130
his bike. So that's what he does. So he just
turns that thing all the way up, like cranks

466
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:49,433
it to 11, which unknowingly affects Carnage
because of the sonic waves. And it's just causing

467
00:41:49,473 --> 00:41:55,356
the symbiote to like writhe in pain, like scream.
I mean, I'm calling bullshit on the whole music

468
00:41:55,397 --> 00:42:01,348
thing because Lobo wouldn't know. What? that
sonic waves affect Carnage. Dude, Lobo rides

469
00:42:01,388 --> 00:42:07,471
the space waves, listening to music all the
time. Okay, so Carnage is like reacting to

470
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:12,494
the sonic energy and he's gonna reflexively
lash out and then stretch one of his arms out

471
00:42:12,514 --> 00:42:18,457
with like this axe head tendril that's just
gonna slice Lobo's bike right in half. What?

472
00:42:18,877 --> 00:42:23,219
And Lobo's gonna like crash into the ground,
skid across on his ass with his handlebars

473
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:23,920
still in his hand.

474
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:32,997
Lobo loves that bike. He's gonna be like super
pissed that it just got destroyed. Alright,

475
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:37,479
so he has the handlebars still in his hand.
He's just fierce. He's just gonna charge Carnage

476
00:42:37,499 --> 00:42:42,942
and just shove those handlebars like right up
his ass. That means nothing to Carnage, alright?

477
00:42:43,122 --> 00:42:48,125
If anything, he's just gonna tighten up... What?
..and hold Lobo there, and he's gonna form

478
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:55,189
his arms into like these giant thorny chainsaws-type
things that just rip Lobo right in half, like

479
00:42:55,289 --> 00:43:01,716
across his midsection. Dude, all that's gonna
do is just turn one Lobo into two Lobos. You

480
00:43:01,736 --> 00:43:09,259
know, one of them being naked from the waist
down. Ugh. So enjoy that view, Carnage. Well,

481
00:43:09,279 --> 00:43:14,862
Carnage is gonna reach out to one of these Lobos.
We'll say the topless one, not the bottomless

482
00:43:14,962 --> 00:43:22,225
one. And he's gonna infect that Lobo. So now
it's Carnage and a symbiote-possessed Lobo

483
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:26,752
against Lobo. and the two carnage characters
are just gonna beat the shit out of Lobo, like

484
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:32,337
taking turns stabbing him and smashing him.
They're just ripping him apart. Okay, so Lobo

485
00:43:32,397 --> 00:43:37,781
is dying, I guess. Yep. Just sensing that this
is the end of the road. He's going to pull

486
00:43:37,801 --> 00:43:43,886
out like a cigar and a lighter from like his
vest pocket. Right? Oh my God. And once he

487
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:49,451
lights up the lighter, he notices how both carnages
react to the flame. They like, like draw back.

488
00:43:49,471 --> 00:43:54,759
They're like, oh no. When he lights up. So.
He's gonna activate the lighter's like flamethrower

489
00:43:54,779 --> 00:43:58,960
mode. And he's just gonna douse both of them
in flames, just turning all of their cells

490
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:05,763
into ash. I'm calling bullshit on the flamethrower
mode. What? You don't know. They saw those

491
00:44:05,783 --> 00:44:10,946
in space. I guess that sounds like something
that he would have. So both carnages are on

492
00:44:10,986 --> 00:44:15,908
fire, probably screaming, you know, they're
dying. The carnage possessed Lobo is definitely

493
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:21,874
dead, but the regular carnage, he rushes up
to Lobo. and he shows his fiery hand up Lobo's

494
00:44:21,934 --> 00:44:27,836
nostrils, entering Lobo's brain through his
nasal cavity and assimilating him. So there's

495
00:44:27,896 --> 00:44:32,937
only one character left on the battlefield,
but he's carnage possessed, so carnage wins.

496
00:44:33,577 --> 00:44:39,619
No dude, that's not how that works. Lobo is
the last character, so Lobo wins. Cletus Kasady

497
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:46,061
is fucking gone. But the symbiote still exists
within Lobo, so carnage wins. I mean, Lobo's

498
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:50,294
gonna love that. He's gonna be like, yeah, now
I have like all these weapons. whenever I want.

499
00:44:50,514 --> 00:44:54,496
There's no way he loses because he got like
symbiote possessed. Well, that's what happens,

500
00:44:54,576 --> 00:45:00,119
so. Yay, Carnage wins. Lobo wins. Let's take
it to the stats. Either the Carnage symbiote

501
00:45:00,179 --> 00:45:04,681
is in control of Lobo, or Lobo is in control
of the Carnage symbiote. Yeah, let's find out

502
00:45:04,722 --> 00:45:08,704
which scenario happens when we come back after
inputting the character stats and running the

503
00:45:08,764 --> 00:45:10,885
1000 simulations. We'll be right back.

504
00:45:15,118 --> 00:45:19,261
That took an unexpected twist at the end. I'm
still not quite sure who won in our speculation.

505
00:45:19,701 --> 00:45:24,044
Well, that's what we're here to find out. So
we input the stats, we ran the simulations.

506
00:45:24,525 --> 00:45:30,209
The characters deferred on a lot of stats. Like
we said Carnage was much more evasive than

507
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:35,293
Lobo, given that he's so elastic. We said that
they tied when it came to speed because we

508
00:45:35,473 --> 00:45:39,937
definitely didn't put in the space bike into
the stats. But I mean, Lobo is still pretty

509
00:45:39,977 --> 00:45:44,455
fast even without the bike. And we also said
they were about even when it came to like fighting

510
00:45:44,515 --> 00:45:50,938
skill and perception. Lobo came out ahead of
Cartage on a few stats such as durability,

511
00:45:51,278 --> 00:45:58,301
damage level, strength, range, and versatility.
Where Lobo smoked Carnage on was intelligence,

512
00:45:58,561 --> 00:46:04,403
which was interesting. Yeah, Cletus Kasady is
not too smart. And Lobo is surprisingly smart.

513
00:46:04,784 --> 00:46:10,610
Yeah. So taking all of this into consideration,
who do you think came out on top? I will concede

514
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:15,251
that I'm pretty sure it's going to be Lobo looking
at the stats, but I think it's not going to

515
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:20,832
be by too much. In the poll that we sent out
to Instagram, 64% of the respondents said that

516
00:46:20,853 --> 00:46:25,094
they thought Lobo would win, and I think that
sounds about right. I think Lobo is going to

517
00:46:25,114 --> 00:46:29,935
take about that much of the win percentage.
Well, I have the results right here. The winner

518
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:43,044
of the matchup between Lobo and Carnage is Lobo.
You're correct. Yeah. 69.2% of the 1000 matches.

519
00:46:43,325 --> 00:46:48,128
That was really close. Yeah, I just have to
say, Lobo would probably be thrilled that he

520
00:46:48,169 --> 00:46:57,516
won by 69%. Well, Lobo may have won this duel,
but he's still a dumb character. Like, Carnage

521
00:46:57,536 --> 00:47:01,780
is way cooler than Lobo. Dude, you don't get
cooler than Lobo. What are you talking about?

522
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:06,463
He's too like all over the place, you know?
Like what the hell is going on? He's so weird.

523
00:47:06,744 --> 00:47:13,311
Carnage is straight up evil personified. Carnage
is just second rate Venom. Carnage is superior

524
00:47:13,351 --> 00:47:16,853
to Venom in every way. I don't know what you're
talking about, man. Oh yeah, then why does

525
00:47:16,893 --> 00:47:24,135
Venom like beat Carnage all the time? Touche.
I have no idea. You know, teamwork. I didn't

526
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:30,658
give Carnage's results. Carnage won 308 out
of the 1000 matches. So he wins less than a

527
00:47:30,698 --> 00:47:36,140
third of the time. Sucks to be you. No man,
it'll suck to be me when Carnage doesn't have

528
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:41,183
a movie coming out and Lobo does. But guess
what? It's the reverse of that. I mean, Lobo

529
00:47:41,223 --> 00:47:47,586
was in the Krypton TV show and like the animated
series. Shut up. You know, I just remembered

530
00:47:47,746 --> 00:47:52,609
wasn't Michael Bay supposed to direct a Lobo
movie? Like that was news back in like 2018.

531
00:47:53,509 --> 00:47:57,631
That just kind of like died off. I mean, doesn't
that happen with most DC projects? All right,

532
00:47:57,651 --> 00:48:05,832
we're done here. Lobo one. Fuck you. That does
it for this duel. Let us know what you thought

before, will be a review of the Venom sequel

541
00:48:46,933 --> 00:48:52,277
titled Venom Let There Be Carnage. I'm super
excited to see how the movie is going to treat

542
00:48:52,317 --> 00:48:57,840
carnage. I'm not sure if the film is going to
be any better than the 2018 movie, but if it's

543
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:03,175
at least as good as it... I'll be happy. Yeah,
I'm going into it like with very like mediocre

544
00:49:03,255 --> 00:49:07,397
expectations. I'm hoping I'll be surprised.
That does it for this episode. We want to give
