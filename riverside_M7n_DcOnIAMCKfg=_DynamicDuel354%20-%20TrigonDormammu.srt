00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:28,927
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:29,287 --> 00:00:33,908
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters and stat-based

4
00:00:34,028 --> 00:00:40,450
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother Johnny DC. And in this episode,

5
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:48,492
continuing Spooky October, aka Spooktober, Jonathan
and I are coming at you with another Halloween

6
00:00:48,592 --> 00:00:54,838
inspired episode. Last week we reviewed Blade
Trinity. And before that we... hit the characters

7
00:00:55,038 --> 00:01:00,720
of Andrew Bennett and Dracula against each other.
For this episode, it's going to be a demon

8
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,561
duel. We're going to find out who's going to
win in a fight between Trigon and Dormammu.

9
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:13,343
This is a big one. They are vastly powerful,
interdimensional demonic entities. And the

10
00:01:13,383 --> 00:01:16,764
duel is just going to be insane. Yeah, these
definitely aren't like your typical demons.

11
00:01:16,784 --> 00:01:21,854
This isn't Etrigan versus Ghost Rider here.
These are like the big daddy. demons, essentially

12
00:01:21,894 --> 00:01:25,496
the devil. Well, not so much for Marvel, but
we're gonna get into this Big Daddy Demon Duel

13
00:01:25,536 --> 00:01:29,898
later on this episode. Before that, we're gonna
break down the latest Kong-Fuk movie news that

14
00:01:29,938 --> 00:01:35,521
came out this past week, including all the drama
surrounding the Aquaman 2 production, as well

15
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:40,724
as all the drama surrounding the Daredevil Born
Again series production. Lot of drama. Yeah,

16
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:47,508
we got Big Daddy Demon Duel's and a lot of mama
drama going on. As always, we list our segment

17
00:01:47,548 --> 00:01:51,038
times in our episode description, so feel free

18
00:01:51,058 --> 00:01:56,261
skip ahead to a particular topic. As our listeners
may know, our dual simulator is so advanced

19
00:01:56,621 --> 00:02:01,204
that it's gained sentience and has named itself
the artificial life form for running extensive

20
00:02:01,244 --> 00:02:08,948
duels, just a rather very intelligent simulator
9000 or Alfred Jarvis 9000. He has a quick

with that out of the way, quick to the no prize.

44
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:19,592
A no prize is an award Marvel used to give out
to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Dual No Prize,

45
00:04:19,872 --> 00:04:24,315
is a digital award that we post on Instagram
and in our email newsletter for the person

46
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:29,337
that we feel gave the best answer to our question
of the week. Last week we asked, what Marvel

47
00:04:29,357 --> 00:04:33,939
or DC character that has not headlined to their
own video game do you want to see get a solo

48
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:39,895
game? We got so many fantastic answers for this.
In the end, there were just too many great

49
00:04:39,955 --> 00:04:44,638
ideas, and what we had to do was nail down the
great ideas that went into more specifics regarding

50
00:04:44,738 --> 00:04:49,162
the gameplay. Right, right. There are a lot
of characters that I think would make for great

51
00:04:49,282 --> 00:04:54,646
open world games like Batman Arkham City or
the Spider-Man game. So we had to prioritize

52
00:04:54,726 --> 00:04:58,469
answers with more definitive gameplay aspects.
Yeah, let's go ahead and run down the honorable

53
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:03,933
mentions as well as the no prize winner. Our
first honorable mention goes to Matt Lamb,

54
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:08,438
who said. Hey guys, it's Matt Lamb here. See,
I'll definitely ask this question a while back

55
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:13,800
and I'll give the same answer, just with some
new details. I'd love to see a Nightcrawler

56
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,321
video game and I'd love to see it as an amalgam
between Assassin's Creed and a game called

57
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:24,523
Aragami. It was a stealth game where you play
as a ninja wraith with shadow powers. I personally

58
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:30,125
love stealth games, especially given the opportunity
to try and ghost a level without killing a

59
00:05:30,165 --> 00:05:34,634
guard or being seen. And I'd love to see a game
like that with Nightcrawler. Yeah, we may have

60
00:05:34,694 --> 00:05:38,496
asked this question before. I know recently
we did ask what your guys thoughts were regarding

61
00:05:38,556 --> 00:05:43,919
a Marvel versus DC video game and somebody gave
a Nightcrawler answer for that, which we didn't

62
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:49,482
give an honorable mention. But for this question,
a Nightcrawler video game in the vein of Assassin's

63
00:05:49,522 --> 00:05:54,645
Creed sounds totally awesome. Yeah, I love stealth
games like Metal Gear, like Splinter Cell.

64
00:05:54,926 --> 00:05:59,968
I think that style of game would be perfect
for Nightcrawler who, you know, could totally

65
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:04,835
stab some fools in the shadows. And, you know,
isn't like insanely over the top powerful with

66
00:06:04,855 --> 00:06:08,478
like body armor and stuff that he wouldn't be
invulnerable in this game and would make it

67
00:06:08,718 --> 00:06:12,481
a challenge. Right. And, you know, he's really
good at hiding in the shadows due to the nature

68
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:17,264
of his blue colored fur. So you can have Nightcrawler
hide in the shadows up on the ceilings and

69
00:06:17,284 --> 00:06:20,386
walls and stuff like that and then teleport
where he needs to go to. I think it would be

70
00:06:20,406 --> 00:06:28,932
a whole lot of fun just trying to stay undetected.
Oh, I want it now. Yeah, great idea. Our next

71
00:06:28,992 --> 00:06:34,675
honorable mention goes to John Spees. Who said?
Hey, fellas, it's John Spees. So I have this

72
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:39,698
idea. It could be three titles, but it's basically
one game. So let's take, like, let's combine

73
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:46,822
the old Myst game with Portals and Arkham and
create a crime-solving puzzle action game.

74
00:06:47,203 --> 00:06:51,485
And if you want it for kids, it can be Detective
Chimp. If you want it for teens, it can be

75
00:06:51,505 --> 00:06:56,969
The Question. And if you want it for adults,
it can be Roar Shack. I love this idea. I totally

76
00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:02,517
remember the old, like, almost escape room type
video games like Myst where you just point

77
00:07:02,537 --> 00:07:07,200
and click on different elements within a room.
I would love to see this as a Detective Chimp

78
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,604
game personally and not just for kids. Like
I would totally play that as an adult because

79
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:15,747
Detective Chimp is dope. Yeah, he could deal
with some quite mature themes as a member of

80
00:07:15,787 --> 00:07:19,990
Justice League Dark, right? Sure. Yeah, just
like Coward the Duck, which is probably why

81
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:24,550
we pit those two against each other in a Christmas
duel that we did a few years back. But no,

82
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:29,213
I think that's a fantastic idea. Like combining
the investigative elements of a game like Myst

83
00:07:29,293 --> 00:07:33,716
with the puzzle solving aspects of a game like
Portal. I think that's a winning recipe and

84
00:07:33,736 --> 00:07:38,179
a whole lot of fun when you incorporate like
superhero themes, especially with the character

85
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:43,923
as fun as Detective Chimp. Yeah, 100%. I could
see this as a mobile game too. It would just

86
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:48,406
be awesome. I would love to play it. Yeah, I'd
play the shit out of it. Great answer, John.

87
00:07:48,526 --> 00:07:52,789
Make sure to listen to his podcast, The Blast
from our Past Podcast with his brother Adam.

88
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,952
Yeah, they're great friends of the show. Love
those guys. Our final honorable mention goes

89
00:07:57,012 --> 00:08:02,596
to Colby Hentges, who said, Hey, boys, Colby
Hentges. The video game I want to see would

90
00:08:02,636 --> 00:08:08,260
be She-Hulk, Ace Attorney. It would look and
play just like the Phoenix Wright games. Capcom

91
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:14,224
can even make it. You do some cases as Jen Walters,
some cases as She-Hulk. Unlock bonus cases

92
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:20,388
you can do as Matt Murdock. But in a very Harvey
Birdman way, all the cases will be defending

93
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:25,595
superheroes against ridiculous claims. I think
it'd be fun. Now, I've never actually played

94
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:30,800
the Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney video games,
but I've heard a lot about them over the years,

95
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,183
and I've always been interested in checking
them out. I know there's a lot of famous elements

96
00:08:35,203 --> 00:08:39,106
from them, like the objection cut scene and
everything like that. With the little knowledge

97
00:08:39,126 --> 00:08:44,090
that I do know about the gameplay and how fun
these games look, basically it's the only lawyer

98
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:50,716
video game out there, right? But I think applying
that to the superhero lawyers, like She-Hulk

99
00:08:51,096 --> 00:08:56,359
or Matt Murdock, Daredevil, is a fantastic idea.
It definitely suits She-Hulk a little bit better

100
00:08:56,539 --> 00:09:00,301
because part of the appeal of her courtroom
stories is how kind of outlandish they get

101
00:09:00,341 --> 00:09:04,464
with the superhero community involved. And I
think it would be really cool to, you know,

102
00:09:04,484 --> 00:09:09,686
like go over the evidence and then see how it
contradicts the witness statements, then drill

103
00:09:09,706 --> 00:09:14,769
them on the inconsistencies to try to get my
client declared not guilty. Sounds really interesting.

104
00:09:15,109 --> 00:09:20,512
I did not know this game existed, but I love
unique games like that. I think if you had

105
00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:24,614
some quick action scenes with She-Hulk where
she had to like punch someone who leapt over

106
00:09:24,654 --> 00:09:31,018
the witness stand or something like that would
be awesome. That would be interesting. Yeah,

107
00:09:31,058 --> 00:09:35,540
Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney is one of the gems
in Capcom's game library. So great answer,

108
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:40,203
Colby Hentges. We also want to give a shout
out to Andrew Shunk, Christopher Manotti, Nate

109
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:46,106
Mantineo, Scott Camacho, Travis Herndon, and
Unworthy Collector from Instagram and YouTube

110
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:51,189
for all going to our website and leaving your
answer. But the winner of this week's no prize

111
00:09:51,469 --> 00:09:57,339
is... Rick McGrew who said, for video games,
I think the blue beetle would be really cool

112
00:09:57,359 --> 00:10:03,941
because you can play it as he just gets the
scarab and the way you unlock is him learning

113
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:09,702
the new abilities that the scarab would do.
So one of my favorite video games of all time

114
00:10:10,082 --> 00:10:16,064
has to be the Metroid Prime series. The graphics,
the gameplay, the puzzle element that it had

115
00:10:16,344 --> 00:10:21,285
was just so enjoyable to play. And I think it
would translate really well into a blue beetle

116
00:10:21,305 --> 00:10:27,129
game. where, like Rick said, you know, the more
control he gains over the scarab that's attached

117
00:10:27,149 --> 00:10:31,691
to him, the more abilities he unlocks, which
allows him to explore previously locked areas

118
00:10:32,092 --> 00:10:37,635
of the gameplay map. Yeah, and also allows him
to defeat previously undefeatable villains

119
00:10:37,855 --> 00:10:41,657
using his new abilities. I think that's a great
idea. I think a Blue Beetle game in the vein

120
00:10:41,837 --> 00:10:46,740
of Metroid Prime is a fantastic idea. There's
just so much potential there. Yeah, and it

121
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,450
doesn't even have to be a first-person shooter.
Like you make that third person, you could

122
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,312
also add like a combat mechanic to it, which
would be really cool with like all the different

123
00:10:54,472 --> 00:10:59,074
arms that come from his back and stuff and blades
that he can make. It would be amazing. Like

124
00:10:59,094 --> 00:11:03,696
the character of blue beetle was made for a
video game. Come on Warner brothers. I know

125
00:11:03,716 --> 00:11:07,977
that you and Disney are flushing out your video
game divisions. Our listeners have given you

126
00:11:08,097 --> 00:11:12,879
two bad ass games each they should totally run
with because they sound amazing. Absolutely.

127
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:17,381
I would play the heck out of all of these and
I'm not even a gamer barely. They just sound

128
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:23,308
like a lot of fun. Just take my money. Take
it. So congrats to Rick McGrew for winning

129
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:28,834
this week's No Prize. Guys go check out his
podcast called the Retro Nomopod. If you the

130
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,139
listener want a shout out winning your own No
Prize, stay tuned to later on this episode

131
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:37,185
when we'll be asking another question of the
week. And now that that's done, on to the news.

132
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:48,009
Okay, so there's been a lot of drama surrounding
Aquaman 2, and this past week it turns out

133
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:54,114
that basically all of the rumors we've been
hearing are true. Some users on Reddit all

134
00:11:54,154 --> 00:12:00,918
banded together and they paid the court fees
to get therapy notes from Amber Heard's therapy

135
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:07,543
sessions released. And they leaked them online
and all of this shit about Aquaman 2 came to

136
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:13,123
the surface including the fact that according
to Amber Heard... Jason Momoa wanted her fired

137
00:12:13,143 --> 00:12:18,607
from set didn't like her and basically the same
with James Wan because he felt that anytime

138
00:12:18,627 --> 00:12:23,410
He posted anything about Aquaman 2 fans were
just riled up by the fact that she was in the

139
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:28,934
movie So it just created a very toxic environment
on social media for any promotion regarding

140
00:12:28,974 --> 00:12:35,119
the film So both Jason Momoa and James Wan reportedly
wanted to get her replaced in the role Which

141
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,982
Warner Brothers was ready to do until Amber
Heard's? boyfriend at the time, Elon Musk threatened

142
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:47,124
to sue the studio. And since, you know, he's
the richest man in the world, they took the

143
00:12:47,164 --> 00:12:52,125
threat seriously. I just think that's all hilarious.
I think it was largely displayed during the

144
00:12:52,165 --> 00:12:58,007
trial against Johnny Depp that she does have
somewhat of a victim complex. So when she stated

145
00:12:58,047 --> 00:13:05,569
things like Jason Momoa dressed up like Johnny
Depp in order to tease her. Right.

146
00:13:09,418 --> 00:13:15,181
went to his defense saying that's how Jason
Momoa dresses. He wears a lot of rings, a lot

147
00:13:15,201 --> 00:13:20,203
of necklaces. He dresses in this very bohemian
style, similar to Johnny Depp, but of course,

148
00:13:20,243 --> 00:13:25,146
she would not really see it that way, right?
Right. Variety also released information saying

149
00:13:25,586 --> 00:13:31,370
that Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Ezra
Miller, and Jason Momoa would not be returning

150
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:36,792
to their same roles in the DCU, though they
did say that Jason Momoa is in talks to return

151
00:13:36,933 --> 00:13:42,676
as Lobo. in the Superman legacy movie, which
was really interesting. I didn't think it would

152
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:46,818
happen that soon. I don't think any of that
was a surprise, except for maybe Gal Gadot.

153
00:13:46,898 --> 00:13:50,640
I did think that maybe she would hold on to
her role as Wonder Woman in the new universe,

154
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,683
but to get it confirmed that she won't be, and
then there was no follow-up statement from

155
00:13:55,883 --> 00:14:01,726
Gal Gadot's reps makes me think that all the
drama regarding her is over. Yeah, no, I agree.

156
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:07,189
I mean, it's not to say that she couldn't come
back to a role in the DCU, sort of like Jason

157
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:11,844
Momoa. but it doesn't sound like it's going
to be as Wonder Roman. Yeah. They also did

158
00:14:11,864 --> 00:14:17,908
mention in the article, the potential for Universal
to perhaps buy Warner Brothers and therefore

159
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:23,572
DC in the future. So no matter what they do
going forward, they need to make it work, whether

160
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:28,136
it's under Warner Brothers, whether it's under
Universal, as it's a big selling point for

161
00:14:28,216 --> 00:14:32,038
Warner Brothers. I think Disney should just
buy them. And then we finally get that Marvel

162
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:38,030
vs. DC movie. Like, why Universal? I guess Universal
is in need of the IP. Disney could buy Warner

163
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:47,155
Brothers over my cold dead body. You alone will
defend this. The purchase if I have to. It's

164
00:14:47,195 --> 00:14:51,357
interesting how Disney might be acquired by
Apple. Oh, yeah. And then you would have Apple

165
00:14:51,397 --> 00:14:57,421
versus I don't want to say universal. It's NBC
Universal, which is owned by Comcast. So really

166
00:14:57,501 --> 00:15:02,943
Apple versus Comcast, two tech companies. Yeah,
that's weird. One company makes the products

167
00:15:02,963 --> 00:15:08,567
that you surf on the other company's Internet
with. We'll see how everything shakes down

168
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:13,089
with Marvel and DC business wise in the coming
years Yeah, the NBC Universal thing we may

169
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:17,552
learn about as soon as next year And I just
kind of want this whole thing to be done with

170
00:15:17,732 --> 00:15:21,874
so if we're gonna sell just sell I think it
could work out. Maybe we'll make some, you

171
00:15:21,894 --> 00:15:26,517
know, Universal Monster comics or something
like that. That'd be that'd be dope By we you

172
00:15:26,557 --> 00:15:35,310
mean DC and not you at all. You know when I
say I really mean DC In Marvel News which I

173
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:40,231
won't refer to Marvel in the first person because
I'm not delusional. Um, we learned this past

174
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:45,453
week, this is crazy news. The Daredevil born
again series is being overhauled in a significant

175
00:15:45,573 --> 00:15:51,214
creative reboot. Basically when the writers
and actor strikes are going on, Marvel executives

176
00:15:51,254 --> 00:15:56,476
were able to review the footage that they had
already shot for the Daredevil born again series,

177
00:15:56,536 --> 00:15:59,957
about less than half of the series was shot.
And they looked at it and said, wow, this is

178
00:16:00,037 --> 00:16:07,007
not working. So they... let go of the head writers
Chris Ord and Matt Corman, release the directors,

179
00:16:07,727 --> 00:16:13,249
and are basically hiring an entirely new writing
and directorial team and a new show runner.

180
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:20,111
And basically overriding their entire process,
not just for this show, but for their television

181
00:16:20,151 --> 00:16:26,093
series in general. Which I think is great. I
think that's fantastic news. This is both horrible

182
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:31,283
and fantastic news. So the horrible news is
that The Daredevil television show is likely

183
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:37,228
going to be delayed indefinitely until they
hire a showrunner, new writers, and new directors,

184
00:16:37,349 --> 00:16:41,152
and then get this thing filmed, produced, and
out there on the streaming platform. They're

185
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:45,756
basically starting from ground zero with the
show, except for, you know, the cast. The good

186
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:51,581
news about this is that Marvel has realized
that their method of making television series

187
00:16:52,022 --> 00:16:57,587
which is in line with their movie production
process where basically Marvel was treating

188
00:16:57,707 --> 00:17:04,154
these television series as eight hour long films,
you know, given massive budgets and then they

189
00:17:04,174 --> 00:17:08,458
would review it and then basically fix what
they needed to with reshoots and post-production

190
00:17:08,518 --> 00:17:12,802
special effects and stuff like that. That is
the Marvel method to making movies, which is

191
00:17:12,862 --> 00:17:16,846
not always successful, might I add. And I do
think they need to rethink that as well. But

192
00:17:16,886 --> 00:17:21,409
the process definitely doesn't work for television
series that are long-form storytelling. You

193
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:25,251
know, there's a lot more story that could go
wrong within the course of six to eight episodes.

194
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:29,214
And there's no overall creative vision that
you get in television series when you don't

195
00:17:29,234 --> 00:17:35,298
have a showrunner. So basically, Marvel's like,
hey, there are some great ideas from your standard

196
00:17:35,338 --> 00:17:41,102
television series-making process that we should
roll into our Marvel method. And we need to

197
00:17:41,122 --> 00:17:46,818
hire showrunners. We need to film pilots. We
need to come up with a show bible. all things

198
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:52,742
that are essential to quality television making
outside of Marvel Studios. Which seems like

199
00:17:52,762 --> 00:17:57,365
a no brainer, right? I mean, I'm surprised they
weren't doing that to begin with. Not necessarily

200
00:17:57,465 --> 00:18:04,110
the pilot thing, but like the show Bible, like
shouldn't that be the MCU Bible? They have

201
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:08,193
to have one. I'm sure they do, but you know,
they're introducing new characters that have

202
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:12,416
very little to do with the greater MCU that
aren't playing into that larger universe. Shows

203
00:18:12,456 --> 00:18:18,120
such as Moon Knight, She-Hulk. Echo. So these
shows can have their own Bible that has very

204
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,785
little to do with a larger MCU, but these documents
need to exist that really steer the direction

205
00:18:24,225 --> 00:18:28,928
of the show for the creatives producing it.
Yeah, a lot of these shows, because they don't

206
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:34,573
really lead into anything else, have really
lost the must see factor that the films had,

207
00:18:34,853 --> 00:18:39,637
you know, during the infinity saga that we had,
because like each movie dealt with like an

208
00:18:39,677 --> 00:18:45,417
infinity stone. or led in some way to Infinity
War and Endgame. It'll be nice to see Marvel

209
00:18:45,617 --> 00:18:50,440
return to something like that for this multiverse
saga. Yeah, we've said it before on the show,

210
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,583
Marvel needs to get back their cohesion that
they once had because everything feels very

211
00:18:54,623 --> 00:18:58,866
disparate right now. And I think this new process
that they're gonna adapt will not only result

212
00:18:58,906 --> 00:19:04,450
in a more cohesive universe, but just better
television shows overall. So RIP Daredevil

213
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:12,474
coming out in 2024, but here's looking to 2025,
maybe 2026. Whenever it comes out, I do think

214
00:19:12,494 --> 00:19:18,177
that there's this unfortunate burden that is
upon the show in that because it's coming out

215
00:19:18,197 --> 00:19:24,580
in Disney Plus and it doesn't have the freedom
of being on Netflix, it has an uphill battle

216
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,962
when it comes to the inevitable comparisons
that will be made to the Netflix show. Maybe,

217
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:34,164
maybe not. You know, if they were just smart
and hired the old writers from the Netflix

218
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:41,022
show, then this whole situation would be moot.
Like. It's so obvious, just do that. I think

219
00:19:41,062 --> 00:19:45,443
that's a great idea. I think that's the only
way they're gonna avoid headlines like sure

220
00:19:45,624 --> 00:19:49,905
Daredevil Born Again was good, but it wasn't
as good as the Netflix show because that very

221
00:19:49,985 --> 00:19:54,046
likely could be the case. I kinda hope they'd
bring the show runner back from season one,

222
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:58,727
Steven S. DeKnight, cause I just think he did
a fantastic job and basically setting up the

223
00:19:58,747 --> 00:20:03,509
whole vibe of what the show would be. But we'll
see what happens. Speaking of anticipated television

224
00:20:03,529 --> 00:20:05,889
shows, that brings us to our question of the
week.

225
00:20:10,454 --> 00:20:17,315

Be sure to answer before October 21st.

231
00:20:47,502 --> 00:20:50,984
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and get into

232
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:56,347
our main event as part of Spooktober. We're
gonna find out who would win in a fight between

233
00:20:56,387 --> 00:21:00,129
the interdimensional demons of Trigon and Dormammu.

234
00:21:15,326 --> 00:21:22,267
Alright, Trigon versus Dormammu. These guys
are the big badass demons of the respective

235
00:21:22,327 --> 00:21:27,949
universes. You know, like Marvel has some pretty
badass demons like Mephisto, Satanish, Lucifer,

236
00:21:28,249 --> 00:21:33,550
and Asmodeus and things like that, but Dormammu
eclipses them all. He's not a hell lord like

237
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:39,912
them, but he is a class three demon who is in
charge of an entire dimension known as the

238
00:21:39,992 --> 00:21:45,650
Dark Dimension, also known as the Realm of Darkness.
Wait, what? The Dark Dimension? That's fucking

239
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:51,013
Trigon's domain, bro. That domain and multiple
other dimensions that he's conquered because

240
00:21:51,073 --> 00:21:57,696
he is DC's premier demon lord, like no contest.
Well, that makes me feel bad for DC because

241
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:03,559
Trigon is super lame and he's gonna get his
demon ass beat by Dormammu, who is so freaking

242
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,143
powerful, you're F'd. This is gonna be hilarious.
Dude, you think Dormammu is powerful? Not with

243
00:22:10,223 --> 00:22:16,434
a name like Dormammu. Like Trigon, yeah, it's
a powerful, strong name. fucking Dormammu,

244
00:22:16,674 --> 00:22:21,097
you're giving me shit about Andrew Bennett.
What the hell is a Dormammu? What the hell

245
00:22:21,137 --> 00:22:27,200
is a Trigon? Trigon sounds like some kind of
like tech company. Like they manufacture printers

246
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,783
or something. Like buy your next Trigon printer.
Yeah, like a really bad ass printer, right?

247
00:22:33,183 --> 00:22:38,246
Whereas fucking Dormammu is like a company that
makes moomoo's or something like that, you

248
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:45,002
know? What? It's like, yeah, you can't fit in
your clothes, buy a Dormammu. Oh my God. I

249
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:48,845
don't know how you're gonna talk that shit about
the Lord of Darkness, but uh, you'll pay the

250
00:22:48,865 --> 00:22:53,329
price. You're gonna pay the price for it. We'll
see. We'll see. To explain the methodology

251
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:59,955
behind our duels, let's go to our sentient duel
simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K, tell our

252
00:22:59,975 --> 00:23:05,660
listeners how you go about determining a winner
in our duel matchups. Yes, of course, sir.

253
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:10,424
The way I determine a winner between the contestants
is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations

254
00:23:10,524 --> 00:23:15,375
using the characters statistics. A Monte Carlo
simulation is a probabilistic model used to

255
00:23:15,415 --> 00:23:20,538
determine outcomes through random sampling.
In this case, I randomised the statistics along

256
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:25,021
a normal distribution as a way to simulate the
many variables that can occur during battle.

257
00:23:25,421 --> 00:23:30,183
The stat parameters are based on the official
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters'

258
00:23:30,224 --> 00:23:35,386
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat
categories are included such as range, damage

259
00:23:35,426 --> 00:23:40,769
potential, versatility and perception in order
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.

260
00:23:41,314 --> 00:23:46,116
The results of the 1000 simulations provide
a percentage of wins for each character. The

261
00:23:46,136 --> 00:23:50,619
contestant with the higher percentage is declared
the victor, as they have a higher probability

262
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:56,462
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,
neither character should win 100% of the matches.

263
00:23:56,982 --> 00:24:01,465
The comic book stories have shown that there's
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so

264
00:24:01,505 --> 00:24:05,387
the confidence rate of my method falls in line
with the precedents that have been established

265
00:24:05,407 --> 00:24:10,950
in the source material. My mathematical simulations
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are

266
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:15,391
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes
tabulated for determination of the winner.

267
00:24:16,811 --> 00:24:21,192
Thanks AJ9K! Before we run the simulations though,
we like to break down each character's histories

268
00:24:21,232 --> 00:24:26,314
and abilities before improvising a scenario
on how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations

269
00:24:26,334 --> 00:24:31,755
would play out beat for beat. And I believe
it is my turn to go first with the Marvel characters

270
00:24:31,775 --> 00:24:38,537
backstory, so let me go ahead and tell you all
about Dormammu, aka the Lord of Darkness, the

271
00:24:38,597 --> 00:24:46,032
Dread One. the god Tyrant, the eater of souls,
the ass kicker of Trigon. Dormammu came into

272
00:24:46,092 --> 00:24:52,255
existence thousands if not millions of years
ago in the realm of the Falteens, an ancient

273
00:24:52,355 --> 00:24:58,397
race of immensely powerful extradimensional
beings of pure magical energy. After several

274
00:24:58,437 --> 00:25:03,800
millennia of existence, Dormammu and his sister
Umar began to pull matter into themselves,

275
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:10,115
taking on physical form, a practice forbidden
to the Falteen race. After slaying their father,

276
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:15,959
Dormammu and Umar were exiled from their native
realm and cast out into the multiverse. They

277
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:20,964
explored numerous dimensions, absorbing more
matter into themselves, until they settled

278
00:25:21,004 --> 00:25:26,508
upon and conquered the realm of darkness, also
known as the Dark Dimension. The realm contained

279
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:31,913
portals into other universes, which Dormammu
and Umar used to absorb other dimensions into

280
00:25:31,933 --> 00:25:37,777
their new domain. After a time, Dormammu discovered
a portal into the realm of the Mindless Ones.

281
00:25:38,158 --> 00:25:43,760
which were indestructible magic beings of destruction.
The Mindless Ones invaded the Realm of Darkness

282
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:48,702
through the portal, but Dormammu and Umar were
able to constrain and imprison them, releasing

283
00:25:48,722 --> 00:25:53,984
them only at their own bidding. Not long after,
Dormammu banished Umar herself to a pocket

284
00:25:54,004 --> 00:25:58,866
dimension so that he could reign in the Realm
of Darkness solely and unopposed, though he

285
00:25:58,926 --> 00:26:04,449
did take Umar's daughter, Clea, into his service.
As the god tyrant of the Realm of Darkness,

286
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:10,164
he waged wars against other realms, conquering
them and growing his dominion, and thousands

287
00:26:10,204 --> 00:26:15,609
of years ago, he turned his attention to Earth's
dimension. He helped create the hellish demon

288
00:26:15,629 --> 00:26:21,233
lord Satanish to spread darkness and prepare
his invasion, though Dormammu's plot was thwarted

289
00:26:21,293 --> 00:26:27,538
by Agamotto, the first sorcerer supreme, who
used his powerful eye amulet and the mysterious

290
00:26:27,578 --> 00:26:33,063
Staff of One to repel him. Hundreds of years
ago, Dormammu tried his hand at Earth again,

291
00:26:33,503 --> 00:26:39,632
causing London's Great Fire of 1666 and using
the life force of its victims to link the realm

292
00:26:39,672 --> 00:26:45,236
of darkness to Earth via Stonehenge. He was
stopped by a young sorcerer at the time named

293
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:51,480
Yao, who would go on to become Earth's new sorcerer
supreme called the Ancient One, and become

294
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:56,724
one of Dormammu's greatest foes across the multiverse.
In the modern day, Dormammu manipulated one

295
00:26:56,764 --> 00:27:02,708
of the Ancient One's disciples, a sorcerer named
Baron Mordo, into serving him and slowly weakening

296
00:27:02,768 --> 00:27:08,052
the Ancient One over time. Feeling too weak
to ward off an invasion by Dormammu, the Ancient

297
00:27:08,132 --> 00:27:13,455
One sent his newest apprentice, the hero Doctor
Strange, into the Realm of Darkness to stop

298
00:27:13,495 --> 00:27:18,858
the Dark Lord's evil plans. Dormammu sent challenge
after challenge at Doctor Strange, though the

299
00:27:18,898 --> 00:27:23,341
Sorcerer was able to overcome them all. And
as the God Tyrant drew upon the power of the

300
00:27:23,381 --> 00:27:28,945
Dark Realm, the dimensional barriers within
began to weaken, including the barrier that

301
00:27:28,985 --> 00:27:34,000
contained the Mindless Ones. While Doctor Strange
was not able to beat Dormammu, he did help

302
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:38,483
the Dark Lord seal the Mindless Ones back into
their confinement, resulting in the God Tyrant

303
00:27:38,583 --> 00:27:43,966
owing him a debt. Strange made Dormammu vow
never to threaten Earth's dimension again,

304
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:49,430
resulting in the Dark Lord swearing vengeance
against the hero, and thereafter trying tirelessly

305
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:53,973
to find a loophole to his bargain. You can learn
more about Doctor Strange in his duel episode

306
00:27:53,993 --> 00:27:59,476
against Doctor Fate. Dormammu found a workaround
by manipulating or allying with other villains

307
00:27:59,576 --> 00:28:05,059
to kill Doctor Strange and negate their pact.
He partnered with Baron Mordo, the netherworld

308
00:28:05,099 --> 00:28:12,183
sorcerer Taza, Loki, Doctor Doom, and others
who were all defeated until eventually Dormammu

309
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:16,906
possessed Doctor Strange himself. Though the
heroes allies, the defenders were able to break

310
00:28:16,926 --> 00:28:21,609
him of the spell. You can learn more about the
defenders in our Suicide Squad vs Defenders

311
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:27,151
dual episode. Later on, Dormammu unleashed the
Mindless Ones on Earth in a ploy to trap Dr.

312
00:28:27,171 --> 00:28:31,532
Strange and his niece Kleia when they entered
the Realm of Darkness. Although Strange and

313
00:28:31,552 --> 00:28:36,794
Kleia were able to free themselves, Dormammu
had absorbed the power of his sister Umar into

314
00:28:36,834 --> 00:28:42,495
himself, becoming so powerful that he realized
that Earth's dimension was not worth his time

315
00:28:42,655 --> 00:28:48,057
after all. Instead, he found it more sporting
to go to war with the Lords of Hell themselves,

316
00:28:48,457 --> 00:28:54,027
including whom you can learn more about in our
Sandman vs Mephisto duel, and Hellstorm, who

317
00:28:54,047 --> 00:28:58,489
we haven't done a duel with but will for sure
eventually. Allying himself with Satanish,

318
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:03,911
whom Dormammu created all those years ago, Dormammu
usurped two fifths of the Hellscape, before

319
00:29:03,951 --> 00:29:09,834
facing against a stand of the united forces
of Hell, led by the superheroine Hellcat, whom

320
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:14,296
you can learn more about in her duel against
Catwoman. Defeated, Dormammu decided somehow

321
00:29:14,336 --> 00:29:19,826
that Earth was again worth the taking, and he
influenced a villain called The Hood. eventually

322
00:29:19,866 --> 00:29:25,371
corrupting him enough to possess him and enter
Earth's realm, though he was eventually exorcised

323
00:29:25,492 --> 00:29:30,296
by the combined efforts of Doctor Strange, Hellstorm,
and Brother Voodoo, whom you can learn more

324
00:29:30,336 --> 00:29:35,662
about in his duel against John Constantine.
Inspired by the zombie virus overtaking other

325
00:29:35,702 --> 00:29:41,047
dimensions, Dormammu created a mindless plague
that infected Earth, transforming numerous

326
00:29:41,087 --> 00:29:46,211
civilians and heroes into mindless ones. The
International Law Enforcement Agency, SHIELD,

327
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:51,715
then formed a new supernatural fighting force
called the Howling Commandos, composed of Zombie,

328
00:29:52,175 --> 00:29:57,118
the Living Mummy, Frankenstein's Monster, and
the creature Man-Thing, whom you can learn

329
00:29:57,158 --> 00:30:01,281
more about in his duel against Swamp-Thing.
Together with the Absorbing Man, who absorbed

330
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:05,944
part of the Dark Dimension itself, the team
was able to cure those infected with the Mindless

331
00:30:05,985 --> 00:30:11,608
Plague. Recently, Ego the Living Planet was
manipulated into joining a cult called the

332
00:30:11,648 --> 00:30:17,900
Brethren of the Forgotten Flame, which prompted
him to become the host of Dormammu, now reborn

333
00:30:18,101 --> 00:30:22,744
in Earth's dimension. The Dark Lord conjured
a horde of mindless ones to conquer the five

334
00:30:22,784 --> 00:30:30,950
planets of Hala, Skrullos, Spartax, Eri, and
Chitauri Prime to use them in a galaxy-spanning

335
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:36,253
pentagram through which he could summon the
entire realm of darkness. It took the Guardians

336
00:30:36,273 --> 00:30:41,037
of the Galaxy, led by Dr. Doom, to stop him,
where Dr. Doom used a spell to siphon some

337
00:30:41,077 --> 00:30:46,233
of Dormammu's power and conduct it into a magic
metal known as Mysterium, which they used as

338
00:30:46,273 --> 00:30:51,577
a giant deity-stopping bullet. The Guardians
fired it at Dormammu, banishing it back to

339
00:30:51,597 --> 00:30:56,721
the Dark Dimension. And that's his backstory.
Powers-wise, Dormammu was a member of the Falteen,

340
00:30:57,162 --> 00:31:01,886
energy deities of intensely powerful magic,
whose might rivals that of the Celestials,

341
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:08,291
entities such as Galactus, and Elder Gods such
as Zeus or Odin. His physical form is but an

342
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:14,100
armor shell for his sun-like embodiment. through
which he commands an eternal supply of mystic

343
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:20,225
energy that can ravage the cosmos. Though he
is considered a Class 3 demon, he is more powerful

344
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:25,630
than any of the Lords of Hell such as Mephisto
or Satanish, whom he created. Dormammu is virtually

345
00:31:25,690 --> 00:31:31,295
indestructible and immortal. If somehow his
intangible raw energy form is destroyed, it's

346
00:31:31,335 --> 00:31:36,119
replenished over time assisted by those who
worship him throughout the multiverse. He's

347
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:41,502
capable of lifting well over a hundred tons.
He can travel the multiverse and the time stream

348
00:31:41,602 --> 00:31:48,624
at will. He can alter his size. He can conjure,
transform, control, and absorb matter and energy.

349
00:31:49,124 --> 00:31:54,626
He can summon demons or mindless ones to fight
on his behalf. He has vast psionic powers,

350
00:31:54,686 --> 00:32:00,867
including telekinesis and telepathy. He can
warp reality. He can create and resurrect life.

351
00:32:01,208 --> 00:32:06,549
He can remove and bestow powers on others. Basically,
it would have been easier to put together a

352
00:32:06,589 --> 00:32:12,839
list of what Dormammu can't do. He has an inconceivably
massive intellect, though he is not immune

353
00:32:12,879 --> 00:32:17,441
to the fault of pride, and he actually does
have some training in an extra-dimensional

354
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:22,843
fighting style. He is slightly weaker in dimensions
he has not conquered outside of his dark realm,

355
00:32:23,084 --> 00:32:27,545
such as the Earth's dimension. There you go.
Oh, what? I'm sorry, I fell asleep. Are you

356
00:32:27,565 --> 00:32:35,369
done? Yeah. Okay. Sorry, I got bored by how
weak and lame Dormammu is. He ain't shit compared

357
00:32:35,389 --> 00:32:39,830
to Trigon. No, you're right. He ain't shit.
He's whatever the opposite of shit is. You

358
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:46,652
are correct. He's way better than Trigon. Right,
I mean he is shit compared to Trigon. Let me

359
00:32:46,672 --> 00:32:52,654
tell you about his backstory. Hundreds of years
ago, a sect of powerful pacifist humans led

360
00:32:52,694 --> 00:32:58,976
by a woman named Azar left the earthly plane
and all its suffering, settling in an interdimensional

361
00:32:59,016 --> 00:33:05,117
land known as Azerath. To ensure that Azerath
would remain a place of peace and goodness,

362
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:10,994
The humans exercised all evil from them and
cast it through the Great Door in the Temple

363
00:33:11,034 --> 00:33:17,659
of Azeroth where its energy drifted and coalesced
in the interdimensional Aether. This evil energy

364
00:33:17,699 --> 00:33:23,844
was eventually channeled into an unknown dimension
by a dying alien race that worshipped evil,

365
00:33:24,144 --> 00:33:31,190
and who used it to impregnate a woman from their
order. The offspring was Trigon, a powerful

366
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:38,055
demon entity that slaughtered his mother and
the before taking over and eventually destroying

367
00:33:38,095 --> 00:33:43,837
his planet. From there, Trigon traveled across
the universe, conquering worlds and eventually

368
00:33:43,877 --> 00:33:49,919
the entire dimension, spreading his evil across
the multiverse and siring children of his own

369
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:56,242
in an effort to expand his legacy and hate.
None of his children, all sons, ever survived,

370
00:33:56,262 --> 00:34:01,684
however, as Trigon either had to kill them when
they inevitably rebelled and tried to usurp

371
00:34:01,724 --> 00:34:07,652
his power, or they were killed as infants in
an effort to stop the spread of Trigon's power.

372
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:14,237
Several decades ago, in the main DC universe,
a young runaway named Angela Roth fell in with

373
00:34:14,277 --> 00:34:20,522
a satanic cult, who accidentally summoned Trigon
during one of their rituals. Trigon disguised

374
00:34:20,562 --> 00:34:26,307
himself as an angelic being and took Angela
as his bride, impregnating her before destroying

375
00:34:26,347 --> 00:34:28,589
the cult and abandoning Angela.

376
00:34:34,062 --> 00:34:40,385
who Trigon had manipulated into finding and
caring for Angela and his unborn child. Angela

377
00:34:40,405 --> 00:34:45,668
was renamed Arella, and though many in Azeroth
were not pleased at the idea of caring for

378
00:34:45,728 --> 00:34:50,831
Trigon's bride, they came to realize that if
the child was raised on Earth, it would become

379
00:34:50,851 --> 00:34:56,274
corrupted and pose a threat to the entire universe
of their old homeworld. Arella eventually gave

380
00:34:56,314 --> 00:35:01,837
birth to Trigon's first daughter, Raven, who
you can learn more about in our Raven vs. Phoenix

381
00:35:01,917 --> 00:35:08,039
duel. When a citizen of Azeroth named Juris
felt threatened by Raven's existence, he attempted

382
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:13,280
to hurl the infant Raven through the Great Door
into the Nether. But upon opening the door,

383
00:35:13,621 --> 00:35:19,842
Juris came face to face with Trigon, who disintegrated
Juris with fiery energy just before the door

384
00:35:19,902 --> 00:35:26,064
shut. The infant Raven herself remained unharmed
by Trigon's flames, and when she grew to a

385
00:35:26,104 --> 00:35:31,225
teenager, feeling her father's evil influence
over her, she opened the Great Door herself

386
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:37,425
and gazed for the first time upon the dangerous
evil presence of Trigon, causing her to flee

387
00:35:37,525 --> 00:35:43,268
Azeroth to Earth in an effort to find beings
willing and capable of stopping her father,

388
00:35:43,728 --> 00:35:48,531
ultimately forming a new incarnation of the
Teen Titans, who you can learn more about in

389
00:35:48,551 --> 00:35:54,074
our Titans vs X-Men Teen Duel episode. With
Raven on Earth, Trigon was eventually able

390
00:35:54,114 --> 00:36:00,137
to amass enough power to breach DC's main dimension,
where he began destroying the planet, beginning

391
00:36:00,177 --> 00:36:05,708
with Manhattan. Though Raven and the Teen Titans
fought against her father, they proved no match

392
00:36:05,728 --> 00:36:11,612
for Trigon, and Raven fled to Azeroth where
her power would be the strongest, yet unknowingly

393
00:36:11,652 --> 00:36:17,795
providing a path for Trigon to find the peaceful
place, which is what he wanted all along. When

394
00:36:17,835 --> 00:36:22,718
Trigon entered the Temple of Azeroth, Raven
made a pact with him in which she would serve

395
00:36:22,778 --> 00:36:29,062
him in his realm in exchange for leaving Earth
and Azeroth alone. Trigon agreed. and brought

396
00:36:29,102 --> 00:36:34,186
Raven to his hellish interdimensional domain
that consisted of entire worlds that lived

397
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:40,411
in perpetual terror of Trigon's wrath. After
Trigon destroyed a random planet known as Zinthia

398
00:36:40,671 --> 00:36:45,755
to show Raven the futility of trying to save
or help anyone, Raven helped the Teen Titans

399
00:36:45,816 --> 00:36:51,180
and her mother, Arela, enter Trigon's domain
where, with their combined efforts, they were

400
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:56,804
able to open a portal to a dimensional void
and trap Trigon there, with Arela staying behind

401
00:36:56,905 --> 00:37:02,103
to guard the gateway. After years of gathering
his power, Trigon was able to break free of

402
00:37:02,143 --> 00:37:08,304
his prison and laid siege to Azeroth alongside
his demonic horde, slaying all of its inhabitants

403
00:37:08,704 --> 00:37:14,326
except for his daughter Raven, whom he corrupted
completely and who joined him in his conquest

404
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:19,627
of Earth. After conquering the planet, Trigon
made the Titan's Tower his throne, upon which

405
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:25,189
he entered a state of meditation to regain strength
as his power continued to corrupt the planet.

406
00:37:25,669 --> 00:37:32,229
During this time, The corrupted Raven was healed
by a ring that contained the pure souls of

407
00:37:32,329 --> 00:37:37,972
everyone killed in Azeroth, imbuing her with
a white light that allowed her to corrupt Trigon's

408
00:37:38,132 --> 00:37:44,276
own evil soul and seemingly destroy him. Trigon's
soul merely returned to his personal domain,

409
00:37:44,316 --> 00:37:49,819
however, where he gathered his power over time
and continued to influence outside dimensions.

410
00:37:50,439 --> 00:37:55,894
Six of his sons, however, were revealed to have
survived and- grown by this point into the

411
00:37:55,934 --> 00:38:02,778
deadly sins of man. As their power grew, Trigon's
grew weaker, and after his sons captured Raven

412
00:38:02,858 --> 00:38:08,542
in order to open a portal to his realm, Trigon's
son siphoned the last of his power, completely

413
00:38:08,582 --> 00:38:15,586
destroying him, only for Trigon's sons to fall
to Raven and the Titans soon after. In post-Flashpoint

414
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:21,129
continuity, Trigon's origin was retconned so
that he was once the evil ruler of an unknown

415
00:38:21,189 --> 00:38:27,112
planet in the multiverse. who was visited by
a trinity of beings known as the Divine. The

416
00:38:27,152 --> 00:38:32,176
Divine possessed an object known as the Heart
of Darkness that they had used on other planets

417
00:38:32,196 --> 00:38:38,280
and galaxies to absorb and eradicate the concept
of evil. The Heart of Darkness had no effect

418
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:44,444
on Trigon, however, who, upon consuming the
object, absorbed the evil and power of nearly

419
00:38:44,684 --> 00:38:51,249
100 galaxies, making him the most powerful being
in that universe, before murdering and skinning

420
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:57,084
the Divine. who were then revealed to be his
parents. After conquering numerous dimensions,

421
00:38:57,424 --> 00:39:02,766
Trigon impregnated a woman from Earth named
Arella, who gave birth to Trigon's first daughter,

422
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:08,688
Raven, and the two of them hid from Trigon for
years in the peaceful dimension of Azeroth.

423
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:15,671
Eventually, Trigon descended into hell and proclaimed
himself among its hierarchy of rulership, gaining

424
00:39:15,711 --> 00:39:21,070
control of a pocket dimension within it known
as the Underrealm, or the Dark Dimension. from

425
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:26,771
which he continues his attempts to corrupt Raven
and destroy her world. Powers-wise, Trigon

426
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:32,333
is one of the most powerful beings in existence,
capable of destroying entire planets and conquering

427
00:39:32,493 --> 00:39:38,714
whole dimensions. His strength, speed, and durability
are near unmatched in the DC Universe, and

428
00:39:38,754 --> 00:39:43,556
he has a cosmic awareness and telepathic ability
that essentially grants him omniscience and

429
00:39:43,596 --> 00:39:49,357
the capability of possessing or mind-controlling
nearly anyone. He's capable of casting powerful

430
00:39:49,397 --> 00:39:55,984
illusions, and altering his physical form, allowing
him to grow to colossal proportions. He possesses

431
00:39:56,024 --> 00:40:02,287
telekinesis as well as the ability to transmute
matter and alter reality, allowing him to distort

432
00:40:02,387 --> 00:40:08,690
space-time or even raise the dead. He can emit
eldritch and hellfire energy blasts capable

433
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:14,652
of destroying planets, and he can generate portals
to nearly any location in any dimension. He

434
00:40:14,692 --> 00:40:20,074
can fly and can regenerate from any injury.
including the complete annihilation of his

435
00:40:20,134 --> 00:40:26,037
body over time. He's a master of the dark arts
and occultism, and though the more power he

436
00:40:26,137 --> 00:40:31,619
uses, the more time he needs to regain his strength.
He is made more powerful in the presence of

437
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:37,942
evil, but also weakened by goodness, purity
and holiness. And that's Trigon. Oh, he sounds

438
00:40:38,022 --> 00:40:43,565
pretty powerful, but it's interesting how his
greatest enemies are a bunch of teenagers.

439
00:40:43,645 --> 00:40:49,833
Oh, as opposed to Hellcats. His greatest enemy
is the freaking Sorcerer Supreme. Yeah, this

440
00:40:49,853 --> 00:40:54,076
Trigon guy doesn't stand a chance. Yeah, the
Teen Titans could totally kick the shit out

441
00:40:54,116 --> 00:40:57,539
of the Sorcerer Supreme. Raven alone could kick
the shit out of the Sorcerer Supreme. That's

442
00:40:57,559 --> 00:41:01,242
the stupidest thing I've ever heard come out
of your mouth. What? You said a lot of dumb

443
00:41:01,282 --> 00:41:05,545
things in the course of this podcast. Raven
versus Doctor Strange, let's run the stats,

444
00:41:05,605 --> 00:41:12,851
bro. Come at me, roll up. Oh, I'll take that.
I'll take that. Roll up. Roll up on me. No,

445
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:15,333
we'll do that later. Let's get on to Trigon
versus Dormammu.

446
00:41:22,734 --> 00:41:26,457
So we've got those characters' histories and
abilities out of the way, let's speculate on

447
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:32,181
how one of the 1000 simulated matches will go.
The winner is determined by simulations, not

448
00:41:32,221 --> 00:41:37,145
this speculation, but it's fun to imagine how
this fight could play out. Alfred Jarvis 9000,

449
00:41:38,066 --> 00:41:43,170
what are the rules of our speculation? Well,
I should say there are no rules, other than

450
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:47,554
the characters have no prior knowledge of the
other going into the fight. All they are aware

451
00:41:47,594 --> 00:41:52,094
of starting out is that the other character
is a threat that needs to be eliminated. For

452
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:57,338
the speculation, the contestants will begin
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript

453
00:41:57,378 --> 00:42:02,181
environment that will have no bearing on the
match itself, as no environmental statistics

454
00:42:02,201 --> 00:42:07,405
are considered in my simulations. The contestants
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright

455
00:42:07,445 --> 00:42:13,209
then let's get into it. Trigon and Dormammu
meet on the battlefield. Who goes first? I

456
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:20,282
mean I'm gonna say Trigon goes first because
he's more badass and evil. What now? Dormammu

457
00:42:20,402 --> 00:42:25,724
is gonna look across the battlefield into Trigon's
soul. And he's just gonna see a lesser evil

458
00:42:25,764 --> 00:42:31,465
than himself. What? Because he's the true lord
of darkness, okay? Dormammu, he's gonna grow

459
00:42:31,485 --> 00:42:37,807
into the size of a goddamn mountain. And he's
gonna conjure the flaming sword of the Falteen.

460
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:42,848
Just, just this massive blade. Okay, meanwhile
he just gets blasted with a massive wave of

461
00:42:43,309 --> 00:42:49,099
evil eldritch energy that Trigon spews from
his mouth. as he also grows to the size of

462
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:55,022
a mountain. Okay, but Dormammu is just gonna
absorb that dark energy into his sword, and

463
00:42:55,362 --> 00:43:00,145
then he's gonna raise his blade into the sky,
which blots out the sun, and turns it into

464
00:43:00,165 --> 00:43:06,608
this black ball of mystic energy. And then Dormammu
is gonna point his sword at Trigon, which is

465
00:43:06,648 --> 00:43:12,351
gonna shrink the blackened sun and hurl it right
into Trigon. That's right, he just threw the

466
00:43:12,431 --> 00:43:17,022
sun. I mean, that's fine. As the sun is coming
at Trigon, he's just gonna... use his claws

467
00:43:17,062 --> 00:43:23,448
to rip open a portal in the fabric of reality
to another dimension so that darkened sun is

468
00:43:23,468 --> 00:43:29,493
going to collide with a planet of innocence
instead and just destroy it so Dormammu likes

469
00:43:29,533 --> 00:43:35,258
that well so does Trigon because Trigon's gonna
absorb the negative emotions from all the millions

470
00:43:35,298 --> 00:43:40,602
of life forms from the planet that just died
and he's gonna channel the energy into like

471
00:43:40,662 --> 00:43:48,023
a massive snake like a stone snake that he conjures
from the ground beneath them that wraps around

472
00:43:48,063 --> 00:43:54,065
Dormammu and crushes his physical form. Well,
Dormammu doesn't really have a physical form.

473
00:43:54,085 --> 00:44:00,428
You know, he's an energy being. What? And he
could just easily escape this snake. But instead

474
00:44:00,468 --> 00:44:07,071
of escaping it, Dormammu is gonna transform
this stone snake into like a giant, heavy iron

475
00:44:07,171 --> 00:44:12,793
chain that Dormammu is just gonna send out.
It's gonna wrap around Trigon and trap him

476
00:44:12,833 --> 00:44:19,383
in a binding spell. Okay. And with Trigon trapped,
Dora Mamu is just going to yank Trigon toward

477
00:44:19,403 --> 00:44:23,924
him and just cleave him right in half down the
middle with his giant flaming sword. Yeah.

478
00:44:23,964 --> 00:44:28,885
Except that Trigon's just going to stop the
blade with his telekinesis and he's going to

479
00:44:28,905 --> 00:44:34,507
grow these massive dragon wings from his back
that just shatter that magic chain that was

480
00:44:34,527 --> 00:44:40,449
around him. And with Dora Mamu in close proximity,
Trigon's going to use his death stare with

481
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:45,710
like his extra eyes. You know how he has like
six eyes? Well that stair is gonna magically

482
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:51,634
turn Dormammu's flaming head into ice. And that's
gonna spread across his whole body, just freezing

483
00:44:51,674 --> 00:44:56,556
him with the coldness of death. At which point
Trigon just shadows Dormammu's body with a

484
00:44:56,657 --> 00:45:04,421
spritin' kick. Okay, uh, Dormammu's body is
ice and it's in pieces on the ground, but all

485
00:45:04,461 --> 00:45:09,884
of a sudden these ice chunks turn bright red
and they melt, joining together into like this

486
00:45:10,064 --> 00:45:17,745
lake of blood. And uh, from the lake... crawls
this army of giant demon skeletons that surround

487
00:45:17,785 --> 00:45:24,390
Trigon and just freaking tear him to pieces.
Dang. Okay, well I mean any demon skeletons

488
00:45:24,790 --> 00:45:30,454
that are touching Trigon, all of a sudden each
of them gain six glowing eyes. Because that's

489
00:45:30,514 --> 00:45:36,799
right, they're possessed by Trigon now. So they
turn around and actually defend Trigon against

490
00:45:36,859 --> 00:45:42,903
the other oncoming skeletons. But also, like
Trigon- He's gonna conjure this barbaric black

491
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:48,706
armor and weaponry for his skeleton crew. So
they just whoop the other skeletons asses.

492
00:45:48,726 --> 00:45:56,090
Okay. Except for the last skeleton, because
the last remaining skeleton's skull is gonna

493
00:45:56,130 --> 00:46:03,414
suddenly burst into flames and uh, transform
into Dormammu. And uh, Dormammu's fiery head

494
00:46:03,474 --> 00:46:09,746
just keeps growing and growing until it just
swallows Trigon whole. And then uh- Trigon

495
00:46:09,766 --> 00:46:14,689
finds himself in the realm of darkness, in the
dark dimension, where everything's like really

496
00:46:14,729 --> 00:46:20,493
trippy. Oh, Trigon's own dimension. Yeah, that's
perfect. No, no, no. Dormammu's dark dimension,

497
00:46:20,653 --> 00:46:28,018
where Dormammu's all powerful. And he's gonna
unleash the mindless ones who are indestructible

498
00:46:28,499 --> 00:46:34,543
and relentless, don't like cyclops, what's the
plural of cyclops? Cyclopsi. I think it's cyclopes,

499
00:46:34,603 --> 00:46:40,891
actually. Sure. Anyway, they only have one purpose.
to destroy everything, and they're gonna destroy

500
00:46:40,951 --> 00:46:47,396
Trigon, who no matter how powerful he is, he's
not gonna be able to stop them. I mean, okay,

501
00:46:47,997 --> 00:46:53,961
sure, Trigon isn't able to destroy them, but
he can't banish them with a swirling portal

502
00:46:54,221 --> 00:46:59,545
to his dark dimension, where they're just gonna
wreck havoc and demolish souls and that's gonna

503
00:46:59,565 --> 00:47:06,030
empower Trigon further, like enough to just
shatter Dormammu's entire dimension. which

504
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:12,333
is gonna fold up into this small black gemstone
that Trigon just holds in his hand with like

505
00:47:12,353 --> 00:47:17,476
a little Dormammu screaming inside of it. And
with a laugh, Trigon's just gonna crush that

506
00:47:17,516 --> 00:47:24,099
gemstone to dust in his fist. Match over. Trigon
just crushed Dormammu's entire dark dimension.

507
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:29,542
Except you would think that crushing the black
gem would just unleash Dormammu, which is what

508
00:47:29,582 --> 00:47:36,834
happens. You fall! What is? Trigon's hand that
crushed the gemstone? It's going to turn into

509
00:47:37,154 --> 00:47:42,397
ash and just spreads all across the rest of
them as he just gets scattered to the interdimensional

510
00:47:42,637 --> 00:47:48,981
void or wherever they are. And Dormammu is just
going to laugh as only his fiery eyes and smile

511
00:47:49,141 --> 00:47:55,905
remain. That's match over. Uh, nah, I'm going
to say that's not how the magic works. Like

512
00:47:56,065 --> 00:48:01,508
Dormammu was friggin crushed. That's how Trigon
wanted the magic to work. But, you know, he's

513
00:48:01,528 --> 00:48:06,158
just a subpar magician. So, oh my gosh, there
you go. We'll go ahead and leave the match

514
00:48:06,198 --> 00:48:11,082
there. Either Trigon collapses Dormammu and
his entire dark dimension into a gemstone that

515
00:48:11,122 --> 00:48:17,666
he crushes and destroys, or the very act of
crushing it itself causes Trigon to die due

516
00:48:17,706 --> 00:48:22,149
to Dormammu's superior magic. We'll go ahead
and see which of these scenarios happens by

517
00:48:22,189 --> 00:48:26,432
plugging in these character stats, running them
in 1000 Monte Carlo simulations, and coming

518
00:48:26,492 --> 00:48:33,617
back with a winner. AJ9K, hit it! Inputting
data. Running calculations. Processing results.

519
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:40,554
Simulations complete. All right. This matchup,
these guys are fricking off the charts on a

520
00:48:40,634 --> 00:48:47,319
lot of the criteria that we judge standard characters
by. Usually your most powerful characters are

521
00:48:47,379 --> 00:48:53,703
able to destroy a city or a planet, you know,
but these guys can destroy entire universes

522
00:48:53,864 --> 00:49:00,268
and realities and have done so on multiple occasions.
So, you know, it's difficult to quantify. But

523
00:49:00,828 --> 00:49:06,367
overall, we did say that. the characters are
actually pretty on par with each other. Yeah,

524
00:49:06,547 --> 00:49:12,328
they're evenly matched in every stat category,
which was surprising to me, honestly. I didn't

525
00:49:12,348 --> 00:49:16,309
think they were gonna be so evenly matched,
but then again, I didn't know much about Dormammu.

526
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:21,711
I thought at least Dormammu had Trigon in the
fighting skill department, but we've seen Trigon

527
00:49:21,731 --> 00:49:26,792
throw down with some impressive weapons of his
own, you know? And I was concerned that Dormammu

528
00:49:27,072 --> 00:49:33,066
was gonna take the intelligence category, considering
the original version of Trigon was only hundreds

529
00:49:33,126 --> 00:49:37,887
of years old compared to the millions of years
that Dormammu has lived. But it turns out in

530
00:49:37,907 --> 00:49:43,709
the New 52 retcon, Trigon is basically as old
as time itself. Even though we all know that

531
00:49:43,749 --> 00:49:49,110
the New 52 is no longer a thing, so pfft, I
don't know why we went with that origin. I

532
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:52,811
don't know, some things have stuck around for
a minute. I think Jonathan just likes to pick

533
00:49:52,831 --> 00:49:57,512
and choose the reality that he's pulling from
whenever it suits him with a better stat number.

534
00:49:58,033 --> 00:50:07,419
Oh yeah, that's fair. Yeah. Damn cheaters. Actually
it stands for damn good continuity. The damn

535
00:50:07,439 --> 00:50:14,101
and good are hyphenated, so it's like one word.
Jonathan, given that all the stats for Dormammu

536
00:50:14,121 --> 00:50:20,623
and Trigon were even, including speed, evasiveness,
durability, strength, damage, fighting, range,

537
00:50:20,723 --> 00:50:24,924
intellect, perception, and versatility, who
do you think's gonna actually win this coin

538
00:50:24,944 --> 00:50:32,038
toss? Please, please let it be Trigon. Please
let it be Trigon. Who are you praying to? the

539
00:50:32,078 --> 00:50:36,919
gods of probability, your gods aren't gonna
help you here. Geez, these are the dark lords.

540
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:43,881
I do have to say though that Instagram thinks
that Trigon is gonna win because fittingly

541
00:50:44,201 --> 00:50:50,083
66% of our Instagram followers who voted chose
him as the winner. And I'd like to think it's

542
00:50:50,123 --> 00:50:56,944
66.6%. I think we just have too many Instagram
followers who are DC fans. If you're a Marvel

543
00:50:56,964 --> 00:51:01,786
fan and you're on Instagram, be sure to follow
us. I just think it's because Trigon looks

544
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:07,188
a lot cooler than Dormammu. Cause Dormammu just
looks like a fucking matchstick. As compared

545
00:51:07,208 --> 00:51:11,510
to Trigon who looks like a legit devil. Well
let's see who won between the matchstick and

546
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:19,773
the devil. AJ9K, the results please. Hey Yuasa.
Alright, the winner between Dormammu and Trigon

547
00:51:20,373 --> 00:51:29,437
is... DORMAMU! Fucking dumb! That's right! It
was close though, obviously, because it was

548
00:51:29,457 --> 00:51:38,062
a coin toss. Dormammu out of 1000 matches won
507, whereas Trigon only won 493. So it was

549
00:51:38,102 --> 00:51:46,826
50.7% to 49.3%. Dormammu won 14 more matches
out of 1000. I mean, I feel like even if Trigon

550
00:51:46,866 --> 00:51:53,050
came out ahead in these particular simulations,
I would still feel underwhelmed. Like I feel

551
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:58,193
like we did not get an answer as to who would
really win, because in reality, it's unknowable.

552
00:51:58,233 --> 00:52:05,049
They're essentially the same character. It is
noble math knows we ran the simulations. Dormammu

553
00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:09,872
won. OK, run them again. We only run them once.
What are you talking about? I'll freaking do

554
00:52:09,912 --> 00:52:14,615
it. I'll run them again. Dang it.

555
00:52:17,817 --> 00:52:25,142
Run them again. What is going on? Oh, here we
go. Try God wins 501 matches. Boom. All right.

556
00:52:25,162 --> 00:52:29,285
Then we'll consider the two of wash and then
we'll say that Dormammu won 506 matches.

557
00:52:32,398 --> 00:52:38,983
Whatever. Dormammu comes out on top and Trigon
be bygons. Yeah, that makes sense. I don't

558
00:52:39,003 --> 00:52:44,087
know if that made sense. No, it didn't. That
is it for this duel. Let's know what you thought
