1
00:00:03,277 --> 00:00:03,338
you

2
00:00:22,798 --> 00:00:27,001
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:32,364
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters and stat-based

4
00:00:32,504 --> 00:00:38,349
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother, Johnny DC. And in this episode,

5
00:00:38,549 --> 00:00:42,512
it's a duel episode. Really excited to get to
this one. We haven't done a duel in a while,

6
00:00:42,812 --> 00:00:48,796
but we're going to find out who'd win in a fight
between Sandman, aka Dream of the Endless,

7
00:00:49,136 --> 00:00:55,300
versus Mephisto. aka the devil himself of the
Marvel Universe. Right, Neil Gaiman's Sandman

8
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,603
is one of my favorite literary works, not just
comic books of all time. So I've been dying

9
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:05,666
to do a dual episode with him forever. But now
that the Netflix show is out, we finally have

10
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:12,509
that opportunity. Yeah, so this duel will tie
into the review of Netflix's The Sandman television

11
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:16,992
series that we're going to review next week.
Now, I know last episode, we said that the

12
00:01:17,012 --> 00:01:22,014
duel was going to be between Sandman and Nightmare.
of the nightmare realm who is a doctor strange

13
00:01:22,034 --> 00:01:27,215
villain but we both kind of balked at that idea
because it felt like it was too much of an

14
00:01:27,316 --> 00:01:31,657
apple versus an apple as it were and who wins
in a fight between an apple versus an apple

15
00:01:32,037 --> 00:01:37,258
an apple exactly on this show we more like to
find out who would win between similar power

16
00:01:37,278 --> 00:01:41,799
level but different power set characters but
with similar themes or stories occasionally

17
00:01:41,999 --> 00:01:45,860
yeah more along the lines of an apple versus
an orange that's much more interesting to me

18
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:52,403
because who wins that I have no fucking The
apple has cyanide in its core. What's gonna

19
00:01:52,423 --> 00:01:56,524
happen? I feel like the apple is more durable.
Uh-huh. So I think the apple, I don't know.

20
00:01:56,544 --> 00:02:00,946
We'll have to run the stats on this one day,
not today or any time soon. But yeah, that's

21
00:02:00,986 --> 00:02:04,388
this episode. Before we get into the character
histories and abilities and run their stats

22
00:02:04,548 --> 00:02:08,510
in 1000 Monte Carlo Simulations, we're gonna
go over the comic book movie news to come out

23
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,772
in the past week, including the news regarding
the main candidates for the head of DC Studios.

24
00:02:14,412 --> 00:02:18,546
We also learned what Warner Brothers may do
with the upcoming Flash film. and we got a

the way, quick to the no prize. A no prize

35
00:03:08,043 --> 00:03:12,158
is an award that Marvel used to give out up
until the nineties to fans. Our version, the

36
00:03:12,198 --> 00:03:16,800
Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award that
we post on Instagram for the person that we

37
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:22,162
feel gave the best answer to our question of
the week. Last week's question was a really

38
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:29,485
tough one. We asked, if you were rebooting the
DCEU as the new head of DC Studios, what would

39
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:35,707
be your 10-year plan in 30 seconds? It wasn't
an easy ask. Some of you guys sent in multiple

40
00:03:35,907 --> 00:03:40,269
answers just to make sure everything was correct
within the 30-second span. And it wasn't easy

41
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:44,959
to choose a winner. But we have three honorable
mentions and a winner, so let's go through

42
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:50,300
those now. Our first honorable mention goes
to Miggy Mathengian, who said. Hey guys, this

43
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,041
is Miggy in phase one, Superman American Alien,
Batman Dark Victory, Wonder Woman Gods and

44
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:58,362
Mortals, Flash movie like Groundhog Day, Green
Lantern movie with Jessica Cruz, and a Justice

45
00:03:58,402 --> 00:04:03,064
League origin film. Phase two would be a Superman
sequel with Supergirl, Wonder Woman sequel

46
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:07,785
with Donna, Flash sequel with Wally and Grodd,
Green Lantern Far Sector, a Zatanna movie,

47
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:12,596
and Justice League Doom. Phase three would be
Superman Brainiac, Wonder Woman Hikateya, Flash

48
00:04:12,636 --> 00:04:17,000
movie where he fights Abracadabra, Green Lantern,
third movie, Titans movie, Mr. American movie,

49
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,683
and Apocalypse War. Wow, he really made a great
use of those 30 seconds. He had it all fleshed

50
00:04:21,763 --> 00:04:26,267
out. That's a great plan. Like in the first
phase, you really set up the Justice League.

51
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:30,770
The second phase, you set up like the legacy
characters, like the sidekicks and stuff. The

52
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:35,158
third phase, like you even introduced the Titans
team and everything. I love that answer. Yeah,

53
00:04:35,178 --> 00:04:40,023
and he managed to squeeze three phases into
10 years, which is really cool. The only gripe

54
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:44,668
I have with it is that there really wasn't a
lot of Batman. And considering he's one of

55
00:04:44,688 --> 00:04:50,174
the main pillars of D.C., I feel like he should
have had a few more film projects in that plan.

56
00:04:50,515 --> 00:04:54,819
Well, we've already had The Batman. I'm assuming
that Miggie's incorporating The Batman movie

57
00:04:54,899 --> 00:04:59,175
into his phases. I'm sure he is. Yeah. Good
job, Miggy. Thank you for putting so much thought

58
00:04:59,195 --> 00:05:03,278
into that. Yeah, great work. If DC Studios put
your plan into action and announced that that's

59
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:07,461
what they were gonna do, Jonathan would probably
shit his pants. Oh, I would. I mean, I almost

60
00:05:07,501 --> 00:05:12,565
did when I heard his response. Ha ha ha. Our
next honorable mention goes to Adam Trumbull,

61
00:05:12,705 --> 00:05:18,629
who said. This is Adam Trumbull here. I'll continue
with the Robert Pattinson Batman Gotham. I'll

62
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:23,653
release a film about Dick Grayson's perspective
on Gotham, the Batman, and the Riddler, and

63
00:05:23,693 --> 00:05:29,061
instead of him coming. Robin would become Nightwing
right away and the different angles he would

64
00:05:29,101 --> 00:05:34,385
take by catching the Riddler. So that sounds
like just a couple of films. Yeah, I mean this

65
00:05:34,425 --> 00:05:39,008
is the opposite problem that Miggie had in that
it's overly Batman focused, right? I think

66
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:43,872
if you took Adam Trimble's and Miggie's plan,
you mix them together, you have a really, really

67
00:05:43,932 --> 00:05:48,676
solid 10 year lineup. I'm surprised Miggie didn't
say he was going to do a Nightwing movie, considering

68
00:05:48,696 --> 00:05:52,358
that's one of his favorite characters. Yeah,
well he mentioned... Titans, but again, there's

69
00:05:52,398 --> 00:05:57,319
only one Batman film in those 10 years. Gotta
do Nightwing, gotta do Gotham Knights I think

70
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:01,920
that would be awesome. That would be awesome.
Our final honorable mention goes to Eric Maisel

71
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:08,362
who said My 10 year reboot looks like this solo
movies for a Constantine Deadman swamp thing

72
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:13,864
which is gonna lead into a Justice League dark
movie Then Nightwing's got to get his own solo

73
00:06:13,904 --> 00:06:19,725
film which will lead into a Titans movie You
got to do far sector in there somewhere and

74
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:24,413
then All of it can wrap up with death metal
so that all the previous versions don't need

75
00:06:24,453 --> 00:06:30,278
to be rebooted. And then for animation, deceased
and DC versus vampires. I really liked his

76
00:06:30,358 --> 00:06:35,522
answer because not only did he expand upon the
Justice League Dark characters, but he also

77
00:06:35,762 --> 00:06:41,167
mentioned DC death metal, which I think is another
big event that DC could eventually get to,

78
00:06:41,447 --> 00:06:45,851
sort of like, you know, Marvel's Endgame or
something like that. If you do Miggy's Justice

79
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:50,002
League Dark Apocalypse War and then maybe like
death metal after that, You're going someplace,

80
00:06:50,122 --> 00:06:55,063
right? It's a plan and a good one too. Yeah,
I didn't know much about death metal until

81
00:06:55,143 --> 00:07:00,205
our recent Cosmic Ghost Rider versus the Batman
Who Laughs dual episode. And yeah, it sounds

82
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:03,986
really interesting. It's definitely something
that you would want to save for one of the

83
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:07,587
later phases though, for sure. Oh yeah, I agree.
Yeah, totally. Because it really goes into

84
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:12,108
the nature of the DC universe itself, that story.
Right, right, right. We want to give a quick

85
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:18,823
shout out to Landon Parker, Laksh Tangi, Scotty
Macho, Lu. Noah Terry for taking the time to

86
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:23,646
visit our website and record good answers to
our question of the week Yeah, I loved hearing

87
00:07:23,806 --> 00:07:30,211
all of your ideas, but the winner of this week's
no prize is Jacob Bell who said hey guys, this

88
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:35,154
is Jacob. Here we go Superman solo movie then
do a Wonder Woman movie that introduces the

89
00:07:35,194 --> 00:07:41,478
Atlanteans then do a Superman Batman team up
movie Then do a Green Lantern core movie that

90
00:07:41,518 --> 00:07:45,761
introduces all the Green Lanterns then do a
Gotham Knights movie where we have the bat

91
00:07:45,801 --> 00:07:52,183
family then do a Flash solo movie, then you
do Superman 2 as the sequel where Lex Luthor

92
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:56,725
is the villain and at the end he introduces
Brainiac and Brainiac is the villain for the

93
00:07:56,785 --> 00:08:02,647
next movie which is the Justice League. Great!
I like that. That's nice and simple. I like

94
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:06,368
how he managed to incorporate all the members
of the main Justice League but he also had

95
00:08:06,388 --> 00:08:10,609
interesting ideas like a Gotham Knights movie
and introducing the Atlanteans in Wonder Woman.

96
00:08:11,058 --> 00:08:15,141
Right, right. It really takes advantage of world
building, I think. Yeah, he does a really good

97
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:19,285
job of building upon his shared universe as
it develops. I don't know if it's quite enough

98
00:08:19,325 --> 00:08:23,949
films for 10 years, but I think those are pretty
much all of the movies I would love to see.

99
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:28,453
Yeah, it's a great start to the plan. Jacob
did send a clarifying message saying that this

100
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:33,257
would actually exist separate from Robert Pattinson's
Batman universe. Which I don't know if I love

101
00:08:33,337 --> 00:08:38,621
that. I definitely think that Robert Pattinson's
universe should be the start of DC's new plan.

102
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:43,116
Now is that just because you don't want to have
multiple Batman again? Because I don't know

103
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:47,139
if their approach that Matt Reeves took with
the Batman, which is overly grounded, would

104
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:51,583
work in a team environment. I think it depends
on the writer. I think a solid writer could

105
00:08:51,623 --> 00:08:56,066
make it work. Maybe we'll see. But thanks to
Jacob Bell for the answer. Congrats again for

106
00:08:56,106 --> 00:09:00,249
winning this week's No Prize. Guys, be sure
to check out Jacob's own podcast called The

108
00:09:04,632 --> 00:09:08,353
the listener, want a shot at winning your own
No Prize... Stay tuned to later on this episode

109
00:09:08,373 --> 00:09:13,124
when we'll be asking another Question of the
Week. And now that that's done, on to the news!

110
00:09:18,542 --> 00:09:24,066
Okay, as we talked about last week, Warner Brothers
Discovery has canceled the Batgirl film and

111
00:09:24,086 --> 00:09:30,150
this has led to just chaos, pure chaos, in the
movie industry. Yeah, apparently everybody

112
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:36,455
at DC hates David Zaslav. What, where did you
hear that? Places, sources. You don't know

113
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:40,878
anyone from DC. I read things on the internet.
I guess that wouldn't surprise me. I don't

114
00:09:40,898 --> 00:09:44,961
think it's fair because you know, you have a
guy really looking out for the DC brand for

115
00:09:44,981 --> 00:09:49,340
the first time. and maybe forever when it comes
to films at least. And of course, this is a

116
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,305
guy who wants a solid plan for DC going forward,
a 10-year plan to sort of capture the same

117
00:09:54,565 --> 00:10:00,610
magic that Marvel has created. Now to spearhead
this 10-year plan, there are currently rumored

118
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:07,156
to be three candidates to head up the new DC
studios. The first one being Greg Berlanti,

119
00:10:07,456 --> 00:10:13,421
who was basically in control of the CW's DC
Comics television series, including Arrow,

120
00:10:13,601 --> 00:10:19,027
Flash, Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow, Black
Lightning, all of them. Yeah, he oversaw the

121
00:10:19,107 --> 00:10:24,248
Arrowverse, as it were. Exactly, yes. So a lot
of people at Warner Brothers in DC apparently

122
00:10:24,548 --> 00:10:29,470
are rooting for him to take that role, even
though he hasn't officially even talked with

123
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:35,551
David Zaslav about it. Well, he definitely seems
the most qualified candidate. To an extent,

124
00:10:35,891 --> 00:10:41,053
he definitely is capable of producing a plan,
as we've seen with multiple crossover events

125
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:46,707
on the CW, like Crisis on Infinite Earths. like
Elseworlds, things like that. But was that

126
00:10:46,727 --> 00:10:52,410
the level of quality that we see from like the
MCU? I'm not convinced. Well, I mean, it was

127
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:56,772
made for TV on the CW with the TV budget. And
that's fair, and that's fair. But he was also

128
00:10:56,812 --> 00:11:00,835
responsible for the Green Lantern movie. He
was one of the writers on that. Oh, that's

129
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:07,398
right. Now he has a shot at redemption for that
because he's producing the Green Lantern television

130
00:11:07,438 --> 00:11:13,181
series for HBO Max, which apparently is still
on track. So we'll see. Maybe if that's successful.

131
00:11:13,618 --> 00:11:17,880
he could step up into the reins of the head
of DC Studios. The other contender for the

132
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:24,445
top spot would be Walter Hamada, the current
head of DC Films, who apparently is being championed

133
00:11:24,505 --> 00:11:28,768
by existing Warner Brothers Discovery executives.
I don't know if I like Hamada in the role though.

134
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:34,212
I mean, like out of all the films that he's
produced for DC, 75% of them have been rated

135
00:11:34,352 --> 00:11:38,795
R. Quite a few of them have been outside of
any sort of existing continuity like the Joker

136
00:11:38,855 --> 00:11:44,642
and the Batman. He doesn't really seem to have
a good idea. for a sense of continuity. He

137
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:49,603
just likes to tell good stories, assuming this
like, multiversal approach where filmmakers

138
00:11:49,623 --> 00:11:55,605
can do whatever they want. Right, right. Hamada
is a good producer, and he's had a lot of success

139
00:11:55,625 --> 00:12:00,827
during his time at DC Films, but you're right.
His current method is not gonna be something

140
00:12:00,847 --> 00:12:05,648
that David Zaslov is happy with, because again,
he's chasing after Marvel money. I do have

141
00:12:05,668 --> 00:12:11,082
to give him credit for DC's television series
on HBO Max though. You know, you had... Watchmen

142
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:16,206
come out during his time as head of DC films
Peacemaker was phenomenal and he's really spearheading

143
00:12:16,327 --> 00:12:22,232
a lot of the upcoming the Batman television
tie-ins, which is pretty cool I'm really torn

144
00:12:22,312 --> 00:12:27,676
as to whether or not I think I want him to come
up with a 10-year plan for DC It seems like

145
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:32,400
he doesn't have a good plan for Superman. No,
absolutely not. Yeah, that's a huge downgrade

146
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:38,714
in my book Now the third contender for this
role is a producer by the name of Dan Lin who

147
00:12:38,914 --> 00:12:44,438
produced the Lego movie and the Sherlock Holmes
films. He was also the producer of the ill-fated

148
00:12:44,518 --> 00:12:49,321
Justice League Mortal film that was going to
be directed by George Miller back in 2008.

149
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:54,565
Now, a lot of concept art and story details
have come out for that film, and it seems like

150
00:12:54,645 --> 00:13:00,409
it could have been a pretty cool movie. Dan
Lin is a DC Comics fan, and that's something

151
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:05,780
you absolutely want. for the head of DC Studios.
I would consider that the primary criteria,

152
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:11,324
given that Kevin Feige was a huge Marvel Comics
fan as he came aboard Marvel Studios. Dan Lin

153
00:13:11,364 --> 00:13:16,168
is definitely the dark horse in this race, considering
he also has his own production company and

154
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:21,351
may not wanna give that up for this role. But
if he's chosen, I think you could find success

155
00:13:21,371 --> 00:13:25,935
with him. Out of these three candidates, I would
say that my preference would be Dan Lin. Yeah,

156
00:13:25,955 --> 00:13:30,038
I think he's done some great films. Like, you
know, the Lego movie had Batman in it. Not

157
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:34,361
that he would go with that same Batman, but
again, he's a fan of the DC Comics characters.

158
00:13:34,501 --> 00:13:40,005
And he has some history with them. Little bit.
Now, of course, we have no idea when the new

159
00:13:40,045 --> 00:13:45,128
head of DC Studios is going to be hired and
come on board and start shaping things. Hopefully

160
00:13:45,168 --> 00:13:50,192
it's soon, and hopefully they come up with some
plan for the Flash movie. Because right now,

161
00:13:50,492 --> 00:13:55,215
we've learned Warner Brothers has three different
options that they're considering. Now, the

162
00:13:55,275 --> 00:14:02,232
first scenario sounds a little optimistic. Basically,
Warner Brothers wants Ezra Miller to seek professional

163
00:14:02,272 --> 00:14:06,655
help. Now, recently, when he's been coming on
sets, doing reshoots and stuff like that for

164
00:14:06,675 --> 00:14:10,878
The Flash, his mother has been accompanying
him. And that's been a big help in sort of

165
00:14:10,938 --> 00:14:15,601
reigning in his behavior, apparently. But they
want him to get therapy and they want him to

166
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:21,806
do an interview at some point that explains
Ezra's erratic behavior over the past few years.

167
00:14:22,306 --> 00:14:27,129
Apparently, Ezra has communicated that he is
willing to do that. But if he keeps getting

168
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,853
charged with burglary for stealing liquor from
someone's home, that's going to make that a

169
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:37,158
lot harder. Yeah, honestly, who steals liquor?
Just go buy your own, especially if you can

170
00:14:37,178 --> 00:14:42,382
afford it, right? Really weird. Really weird.
Bizarre. Dangerous behavior. Absolutely. Now

171
00:14:42,422 --> 00:14:47,246
the second scenario is that if Miller doesn't
seek professional help, Warner Brothers can

172
00:14:47,287 --> 00:14:51,950
still release the film, but they just wouldn't
have Miller play a prominent role in the marketing

173
00:14:51,991 --> 00:14:57,619
and publicity of the movie. It's not an ideal
scenario. this one because Ezra Miller is so

174
00:14:57,699 --> 00:15:02,081
prominent throughout the movie. It's going to
be weird if he doesn't promote it. And if things

175
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:06,904
continue to get worse with Ezra Miller and his
behavior, Warner Brothers has a third option,

176
00:15:07,204 --> 00:15:12,967
which is to scrap the movie outright, just like
what they did with Batgirl. At a certain point,

177
00:15:13,267 --> 00:15:18,150
the public would really no longer want to see
any movie with them. It would just be kind

178
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:23,313
of tainted and not enjoyable. And while previously,
while that probably would have been detrimental

179
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:27,535
to the future of DC films, Since we already
know Zezlav wants to reboot the whole thing,

180
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:31,638
canceling the film is not the worst thing that
could happen. I don't think so, honestly. And

181
00:15:31,658 --> 00:15:36,082
I'm still kinda hoping they reboot sooner rather
than later. I know a lot of people don't feel

182
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:41,205
that way. But so again, basically Warner Bros.
Discovery's options are release and promote

183
00:15:41,245 --> 00:15:46,209
the film with Ezra Miller provided they get
professional help. Or still release the film

184
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:51,093
without having Ezra Miller promote it. Or scrap
the film. Yeah, and it kinda seems like their

185
00:15:51,173 --> 00:15:57,038
hands are tied. by Ezra Miller's choices, which
is not a good spot for a studio to be in, I

186
00:15:57,058 --> 00:16:01,847
feel like. But even if the best-case scenario
happens, would people still be interested in

187
00:16:01,887 --> 00:16:05,193
seeing the Flash movie? That brings us to our
question of the week.

188
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:15,771
If Ezra Miller gets professional help and explains
their erratic behavior, would you still be

189
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:20,873
open to watching The Flash movie? If you weren't
already. And let us know why. Record your answer

of news, HBO Max has released the trailer for

195
00:16:45,642 --> 00:16:52,407
season three of Pennyworth, which now has a
new subtitle, Pennyworth, the origin of Batman's

196
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:59,452
butler, which has to be the worst fucking subtitle
of any show ever. It's so bad. It's embarrassing.

197
00:16:59,512 --> 00:17:04,515
It's so literal. I know, it's so on the nose.
I don't know who came up with that. They just

198
00:17:04,535 --> 00:17:09,882
need to undo that, release a new trailer. It
could be salvaged. Have you watched any seasons

199
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:16,224
of Pennyworth? No, I don't have the Epics network.
Prior to this being an HBO Max original, this

200
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:21,925
show was an exclusive on Epics, of course. They
released two seasons, haven't seen either of

201
00:17:21,945 --> 00:17:26,366
them, was never really interested, honestly,
in seeing them, even though it's a DC show.

202
00:17:26,707 --> 00:17:31,208
It's not terrible from what I've heard. Well,
I mean, it's on season three, so it obviously

203
00:17:31,248 --> 00:17:35,969
has some sort of fan base. Yeah, absolutely,
absolutely. This trailer, I have to say, doesn't

204
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:41,780
quite sell me on anything, though. It's a little
bit more style over substance. It seems a little,

205
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:46,764
I don't know, Austin Powers, I guess, if I could
describe it as anything. A non-comedic version

206
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:51,847
of Austin Powers, which some might say is James
Bond. Austin Powers is a James Bond parody.

207
00:17:52,188 --> 00:17:58,332
Yeah, and I definitely get spy intrigue vibes
from this show. Just very dated vibes, I would

208
00:17:58,372 --> 00:18:03,436
say. Like 70s dated. Hey, some of the best James
Bond movies came out in the 1970s, man. The

209
00:18:03,516 --> 00:18:08,340
worst fucking James Bond movies came out in
the 1970s. Yeah, also the worst ones. Yeah.

210
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,743
Roger Moore was a little inconsistent in the
trailer. Alfred Pennyworth explains that he

211
00:18:12,783 --> 00:18:19,048
charges for his services, but that his honor
isn't for sale in a very decent Michael Caine

212
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:24,312
impression. Yeah, it really seems like this
is the Alfred Pennyworth of the Nolan Batman

213
00:18:24,332 --> 00:18:29,007
films. I get that impression. Absolutely. But
the rest of the trailer doesn't tell me anything

214
00:18:29,047 --> 00:18:33,151
about the story for the season. It's just a
bunch of quick action shots before the new

215
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:38,815
title of the series is revealed. Do you think
the show delves into any of Batman's rogues

216
00:18:38,855 --> 00:18:43,859
galleries past? Like, do we see any of the Falcone
crime family or something in the show? I would

217
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:48,523
be surprised considering the show takes place
in Britain. But I have no idea because I haven't

218
00:18:48,543 --> 00:18:52,727
seen any of the seasons. Well, which one of
Batman's villains is from Britain? Mad Hatter?

219
00:18:53,247 --> 00:18:58,114
Yep. Possibly him. Who else? I don't know. Not
many. I feel like it's really him just going

220
00:18:58,174 --> 00:19:03,196
up against like KGB agents or something like
that. That's the impression that I get. We

221
00:19:03,356 --> 00:19:09,279
are considering reviewing this season. It doesn't
start until October. We don't have an official

222
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:13,120
release date yet. We just know the month and
we do know that it's going to have 10 episodes.

223
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:19,383
If we do review it, I can't say I'm going to
commit to watching seasons one and two in lead

224
00:19:19,403 --> 00:19:24,485
up to it. So you have to you have to you're
the DC fan. I don't want to. You have to because

225
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:28,988
I'm not gonna. Somebody has to. It might be
good, you never know. If someone out there

226
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:33,872
who's listening has watched the Pennyworth television
series and is a fan of it, reach out to us

227
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:37,775
and let us know why you like it. Yeah, maybe
I can be convinced to watch the earlier seasons,

228
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:44,140
which are on HBO Max now, as the trailer also
teases, it's like, catch up now before the

229
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,404
third season. We'll see, we'll see HBO Max.
But I think that does it for the news for this

230
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:52,867
episode, so let's go ahead and get into our
main event where we find out who'd win in a

231
00:19:52,907 --> 00:19:58,013
fight between Sandman of the Endless, and Mephisto,
the devil himself.

232
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:18,649
Alright, Sandman versus Mephisto. Now again,
this duel is in lead up to the review of season

233
00:20:18,829 --> 00:20:24,053
one of The Sandman, which is on Netflix right
now. Check it out, it's awesome. Yeah, Jonathan

234
00:20:24,073 --> 00:20:29,517
won't let me watch past episode three because
he has an idea for this duel speculation that

235
00:20:29,537 --> 00:20:33,639
we're about to do that he doesn't want me to
spoil for myself. Right, right. Because I guess

236
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:40,084
in the series, at some point, Sandman gets into
a battle with Lucifer. Yeah, it's Lucifer in

237
00:20:40,124 --> 00:20:45,587
the TV series and a demon in the comic book.
but it still works out because it's a demon

238
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:50,089
game. And perfect for this matchup. Yeah, and
if you guys don't know who Mephisto is, he

239
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:57,012
has been long rumored to appear in the MCU for
ages now. It's become kind of a meme, but he's

240
00:20:57,032 --> 00:21:01,955
basically the devil in the Marvel universe.
He's a villain for almost all of Marvel's heroes,

241
00:21:02,275 --> 00:21:07,577
but especially like Silver Surfer, Ghost Rider,
Doctor Strange, Thor, and Spider-Man sometimes.

242
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:12,115
I think we primarily chose these two characters
because they're both insanely powerful and

243
00:21:12,135 --> 00:21:16,357
they both have their own realms that they're
like in charge of. Right, exactly. They could

244
00:21:16,377 --> 00:21:20,819
basically do almost anything within their own
realm, but they're no slouch either outside

245
00:21:20,859 --> 00:21:25,581
of their home. And they both have like rock
star haircuts. So yeah, totally. Yeah. If you've

246
00:21:25,621 --> 00:21:29,803
never listened to one of our dual episodes before,
the way we determine a winner between these

247
00:21:29,843 --> 00:21:37,070
two characters is by running 1000 Monte Carlo
simulations using their statistics. is a probabilistic

248
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:41,973
model used to determine outcomes through random
sampling. And in our case it randomizes statistics

249
00:21:42,013 --> 00:21:46,436
along a normal distribution, which is a bell
curve, as a way to simulate the many variables

250
00:21:46,457 --> 00:21:50,819
that can occur during battle. The stat parameters
we use are based on the official Marvel power

251
00:21:50,859 --> 00:21:56,423
grid, and we use that criteria to extrapolate
the DC character's stats. We've included some

252
00:21:56,463 --> 00:22:00,606
additional stat categories of our own, such
as range, damage potential,

253
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:10,753
Running these 1000 simulations gives us a percentage
of wins for each character, and we declare

254
00:22:10,794 --> 00:22:14,997
the one with the higher percentage to be the
ultimate victor, considering that they're more

255
00:22:15,037 --> 00:22:19,901
likely to win any given battle. No character
ever wins 100% of the time. Comics have shown

256
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:24,725
that there's usually a way for Batman to defeat
Superman, and we feel our method falls in line

257
00:22:24,745 --> 00:22:29,409
with the precedents that have been established
in the comic book stories. And we used this

258
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:34,393
method because it was the least subjective,
most unbiased way to determine who would win.

259
00:22:34,838 --> 00:22:39,803
Of course, we are both heavily biased toward
our respective allegiances, so instead of debating

260
00:22:39,883 --> 00:22:44,808
these matches forever, we just let the math
decide for us. There's no fan votes here, and

261
00:22:44,888 --> 00:22:49,293
no relying on just feats. Before we run the
simulations though, we like to break down each

262
00:22:49,313 --> 00:22:54,439
character's histories and abilities before improvising
a scenario on how we imagine one of the 1000

263
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:59,722
simulations we run would play out beat for beat.
Yeah, and I think it's my turn to go first

264
00:22:59,742 --> 00:23:04,344
with my character's backstory, though I do,
before I begin, want to preface this backstory

265
00:23:04,464 --> 00:23:09,605
with a spoiler warning. I know some of our patrons,
specifically, are working their way through

266
00:23:09,625 --> 00:23:14,307
the Sandman comic series, and anyone who wants
to get through the Sandman television series

267
00:23:14,347 --> 00:23:19,188
completely fresh should know that unlike the
stories of many comic characters we break down

268
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:24,742
on this podcast, the story of Sandman has a
definitive ending. which I will be revealing,

269
00:23:25,003 --> 00:23:30,667
so skip this part if you don't want to get spoiled.
Definitely recommend the series and or watching

270
00:23:30,687 --> 00:23:37,151
the show. Alright, so Sandman is one of many
titles bestowed upon a being known as Dream,

271
00:23:37,412 --> 00:23:43,736
who is the ruler and personification of dreams,
stories, imagination, and essentially thought.

272
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:50,541
He's one of seven personified beings of unimaginable
power known as the Endless, who manifested

273
00:23:50,621 --> 00:23:56,667
naturally as the universe formed and are older
than the gods. When life first emerged, so

274
00:23:56,707 --> 00:24:03,069
did destiny, then death. When beings became
sentient, dream came into existence, followed

275
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:10,311
by destruction, desire, despair, and finally,
delight, who later became delirium. Each of

276
00:24:10,351 --> 00:24:15,652
the Endless have their own realms which they
are responsible for, dreams being the dreaming,

277
00:24:15,812 --> 00:24:21,302
where beings go when their consciousness escapes
reality. When the first murder victim in the

278
00:24:21,382 --> 00:24:26,765
universe died, Dream took pity on him, and death
allowed Dream to bring him into the Dreaming

279
00:24:26,845 --> 00:24:32,248
instead of the afterlife. Dream named him Abel,
and he became a storyteller who lived in the

280
00:24:32,268 --> 00:24:38,092
House of Secrets. Eventually, Abel became lonely,
however, so Dream also brought his brother

281
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:43,715
Cain into the Dreaming when he died, gifting
him the House of Mystery. Over the course of

282
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:50,795
billions of years within the Dreaming, Dream
crafted more and more Dreamlands and Nightmares,

283
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:58,460
while also collecting more and more titles such
as Morpheus, Oniros, and The Sandman. To help

284
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:05,085
him maintain the Dream Inc, Dreamcrafted several
tools, including a pouch of magic sand, a ruby

285
00:25:05,145 --> 00:25:10,649
red dreamstone to harness Dreams and Focus's
power, and a helm made from the bones of an

286
00:25:10,789 --> 00:25:16,433
ancient god as a symbol of his station and power.
Ten thousand years ago, while traveling on

287
00:25:16,573 --> 00:25:22,612
Earth, Dream and an African queen named Nada
saw each other and fell in love, though Dream

288
00:25:22,652 --> 00:25:28,454
disappeared afterward and Nada was unaware that
he was one of the Endless. After finding him

289
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:34,717
again in the Dreaming, Nada fled when she realized
who he was, knowing they could never be together.

290
00:25:35,277 --> 00:25:40,979
Dream sought after her, however, and eventually
the two copulated their love, only to awaken

291
00:25:40,999 --> 00:25:47,022
the next morning with Nada's city destroyed.
Blaming herself, she committed suicide. though

292
00:25:47,042 --> 00:25:51,844
Dream was able to save her soul and promised
to make her Queen of the Dreaming. When she

293
00:25:51,904 --> 00:25:57,147
refused, he banished her to hell for eternity.
That's cold blooded. Oh yeah, Dream was petty

294
00:25:57,187 --> 00:26:02,450
as hell back in the old days. Just over 2,000
years ago, Dream and the Greek muse of epic

295
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:09,434
poetry, Calliope, had a son, the mythic loot
player Orpheus. Orpheus led a tragic life,

296
00:26:09,474 --> 00:26:15,117
however, losing his fiance, Eurydice, to the
underworld and later dying by having his body

297
00:26:15,177 --> 00:26:21,335
ripped apart. As a progeny of the Endless, however,
his head survived and continued to live on

298
00:26:21,435 --> 00:26:27,376
as an oracle. Meanwhile, Dream and Calliope
became estranged from one another. In 14th

299
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:32,878
century London, Dream accompanied his sister
Death amongst the people at her request. While

300
00:26:32,918 --> 00:26:37,779
in a tavern, they overheard a man named Hob
Gadling tell his friends that he refused to

301
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:41,940
die, and as a favor to Dream, Death agreed never
to take him.

302
00:26:46,162 --> 00:26:52,186
every 100 years, and in their second meeting
in the 16th century, Dream also met a man named

303
00:26:52,286 --> 00:26:58,030
Will Shaxbird, an aspiring playwright who made
a deal with Dream to write stories that would

304
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:03,994
spur new dreams in the minds of men in exchange
for unlimited inspiration. Dream commissioned

305
00:27:04,114 --> 00:27:09,438
two plays from Shaxbird, who would find success
under the name Shakespeare, one of which, A

306
00:27:09,478 --> 00:27:16,238
Midsummer's Night Dream, was made specifically
so that the people of that used to inhabit

307
00:27:16,278 --> 00:27:21,743
the world. During Dream's 18th century meeting
with Hob in the Tavern, the two were ambushed

308
00:27:21,803 --> 00:27:26,667
by Lady Johanna Constantine, who had heard of
their meetings and intended to kidnap them

309
00:27:26,747 --> 00:27:32,132
in order to learn their secrets. Dream put her
to sleep and later requested her help in retrieving

310
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:37,776
his son Orpheus's head, which had been stolen
by the French government. In the early 20th

311
00:27:37,836 --> 00:27:43,421
century, a British occultist named Roderick
Burgess accidentally trapped and imprisoned

312
00:27:43,501 --> 00:27:49,185
Dream. during an occult ritual in an attempt
to capture and control death. While Dream was

313
00:27:49,225 --> 00:27:54,689
imprisoned, several people around the world
suffered from severe sleeping disorders, including

314
00:27:54,829 --> 00:28:00,753
a young British woman named Unity Kincaid, who
would not wake up. Remaining silent and offering

315
00:28:00,873 --> 00:28:06,857
nothing in exchange for his release, Dream remained
trapped for over 70 years, during which time

316
00:28:07,097 --> 00:28:15,811
his sand pouch, helmet, and dreamstone were
stolen by When Dream finally managed to break

317
00:28:15,871 --> 00:28:21,715
free, Roderick had already died, so he got his
revenge on his son Alex Burgess by cursing

318
00:28:21,735 --> 00:28:27,099
him with a never-ending nightmare. Dream returned
to the dreaming weekend, and found his realm

319
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:32,923
in near collapse, abandoned by his creations
due to his absence. Needing the tools that

320
00:28:32,943 --> 00:28:38,447
were stolen from him to regain his power, Dream
summoned the Three Fates, who directed him

321
00:28:38,487 --> 00:28:44,047
to John Constantine for his sand pouch, Hel
for his helm, and and the Justice League for

322
00:28:44,087 --> 00:28:48,170
his Dreamstone. You can of course learn more
about John Constantine and the Justice League

323
00:28:48,471 --> 00:28:53,655
in their respective dual episodes of this podcast.
After regaining his sand pouch from Constantine's

324
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:58,900
ex-girlfriend and his helm from a demon after
defeating him in a game, Dream learned that

325
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:06,066
his Dreamstone had been used by the reality-warping
super-villain Dr. Destiny, aka John D., the

326
00:29:06,126 --> 00:29:11,799
son of Ethel Cripps, who had corrupted the Dreamstone.
When Dream tried to recover the Dreamstone

327
00:29:11,839 --> 00:29:17,404
from Justice League's storage, its corrupted
form sat his remaining energy, just before

328
00:29:17,484 --> 00:29:23,469
John D broke out of Arkham Asylum and retook
the Dreamstone. Causing the world to go insane,

329
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:30,195
Dream challenged John D to a battle in the Dreaming,
where John D attempted to kill Dream by destroying

330
00:29:30,255 --> 00:29:35,680
the Dreamstone. Instead, Dream's full power
was returned to him, and Dream returned John

331
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:41,385
D back to Arkham Asylum. After restoring the
Dreaming to its former glory, its former citizens

332
00:29:41,465 --> 00:29:47,810
all returned, save for a domain known as Fiddler's
Green and three nightmares named Brut, Glob,

333
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:53,234
and the Corinthian. Thanks to a young woman
named Rose Walker, the granddaughter of Unity

334
00:29:53,274 --> 00:29:59,119
Kincaid, Dream was able to return Fiddler's
Green to the Dreaming, unmake the Corinthian,

335
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:04,664
and banish Brut and Glob to the darkness for
creating their own pocket Dreaming inside the

336
00:30:04,704 --> 00:30:10,616
mind of Rose's younger brother Jed. where they
also kept the ghost of Hector Hall, the son

337
00:30:10,656 --> 00:30:15,941
of Hawkman and Hawkgirl, and his pregnant wife,
Lyta. Dream pushed Hector's ghost into the

338
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:21,685
afterlife and told Lyta that since her baby
gestated in the dreaming, it belonged to him.

339
00:30:22,126 --> 00:30:27,510
Rose turned out to be a being known as a Vortex,
capable of breaking down the barriers between

340
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:33,154
people's dreams, and Dream was nearly forced
to kill her to protect the world until Unity

341
00:30:33,194 --> 00:30:38,582
Kincaid intervened and revealed that she would
have been the Vortex had Dream not been trapped

342
00:30:38,622 --> 00:30:45,445
by Roderick Burgess. Unity took Rose's vortex
aspect and died in the process. Dream later

343
00:30:45,505 --> 00:30:52,488
learned that Desire impregnated Unity in her
sleep, making Rose his niece. Had Dream killed

344
00:30:52,568 --> 00:30:58,170
Rose, per ancient rules that bind the Endless,
Dream would have been forced to sacrifice his

345
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:04,693
life to the Fates for spilling family blood,
which was Desire's goal all along as he slash

346
00:31:04,713 --> 00:31:10,709
she had hated Dream. for billions of years,
constantly interfering in his affairs in secret,

347
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:16,695
and was even responsible for the death of Eurydice.
Dream later learned Calliope had been imprisoned

348
00:31:16,735 --> 00:31:22,620
by a rider with Rider's Block and he freed her,
as well as Nata from Hell, finally forgiving

349
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:29,326
her for rejecting him and helping her reincarnate.
While in Hell, Lucifer, out of revenge for

350
00:31:29,386 --> 00:31:35,878
Dream's previous visit, abandoned Hell and gave
it to Dream. resulting in many pantheons visiting

351
00:31:35,918 --> 00:31:42,040
the Dreaming to ask for the realm. This included
the fairy, who gifted Dream a fairy servant

352
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:48,282
named Noella to gain his favor. In the end,
two angels from heaven visited Dream to claim

353
00:31:48,322 --> 00:31:53,923
hell in the name of God. Dream was later asked
by Delirium to help her find their long-lost

354
00:31:53,983 --> 00:31:59,725
brother Destruction, who had abandoned his responsibilities
and gone missing thousands of years earlier.

355
00:32:00,105 --> 00:32:06,154
With the help of his oracle son Orpheus, Still
a living decapitated head, Dream and Delirium

356
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:10,856
found their brother Destruction, who rejected
their suggestion that he return to his role

357
00:32:10,916 --> 00:32:16,778
as one of the Endless. Fulfilling a promise
to his son, Dream returned to Orpheus and peacefully

358
00:32:16,858 --> 00:32:22,599
ended his pitiful life. Having returned to the
Dreaming, Dream set Noella the Fairy free,

359
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:27,181
giving her a magic pendant that allowed her
to summon him as a reward for her faithful

360
00:32:27,241 --> 00:32:33,287
service. Dream also recreated the Corinthian.
who he sent along with his raven Matthew to

361
00:32:33,347 --> 00:32:39,229
rescue Daniel, Lyda's son, who had been kidnapped
by the Norse god Loki and Robin Goodfellow.

362
00:32:39,589 --> 00:32:45,392
Believing that Dream had killed Daniel, Lyda,
merged with the Fates, stormed the Dreaming

363
00:32:45,432 --> 00:32:50,754
to destroy Dream for supposedly killing his
adopted son, per the ancient rules. Though

364
00:32:50,774 --> 00:32:55,436
it was revealed that this wasn't the case, the
Fates, in their vengeful state known as the

365
00:32:55,476 --> 00:33:01,354
Kindly Ones, maintained their claim on Dream's
life, since he had killed his son Orpheus.

366
00:33:01,755 --> 00:33:07,037
Soon, the Kindly Ones began harming Dream's
loyal servants and freeing his prisoners, and

367
00:33:07,077 --> 00:33:13,099
to protect him, Nuala used her pendant to summon
Dream to the Fairy Realm, unaware that the

368
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:18,322
Kindly Ones could not harm Dream outside of
the Dreaming. Before facing the Kindly Ones,

369
00:33:18,642 --> 00:33:24,124
Dream gifted Daniel, who had been saved by the
Corinthian, an emerald dreamstone. As he was

370
00:33:24,184 --> 00:33:29,307
chosen to take on the role of the ruler and
caretaker of the Dreaming, after Dream's death.

371
00:33:29,927 --> 00:33:35,432
To save the Dreaming from the Kindly Ones, Dream
summoned his sister, Death, to escort him to

372
00:33:35,492 --> 00:33:41,177
her realm known as the Sunless Lands. A massive
wake was held in the Dreaming in Dream's honor

373
00:33:41,517 --> 00:33:46,201
with all of his siblings in attendance, and
his body was sent to drift on a barge within

374
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:51,846
the Dreaming. And that's Dream's complete story
from Neil Gaiman's initial Sandman run. I haven't

375
00:33:51,866 --> 00:33:57,118
gotten into any of the apocryphal works at all.
Powers-wise, Dream of the Endless wields the

376
00:33:57,158 --> 00:34:04,242
power of stories and imagination, capable of
creating or uncreating anything, anyone, or

377
00:34:04,322 --> 00:34:10,606
any place that could be dreamed up. He can will
other beings to sleep, cast or dispel illusions,

378
00:34:11,006 --> 00:34:16,169
affect the thoughts and perceptions of others,
and he could teleport himself or others to

379
00:34:16,249 --> 00:34:21,832
any location in the dreaming, and he could travel
through or track anyone who dreams. He can

380
00:34:21,952 --> 00:34:27,132
alter his appearance at will, heal injuries,
and he can transfer his powers to objects or

381
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:32,878
people. Within his own realm of the Dreaming,
he is nigh omnipotent, having complete control

382
00:34:33,198 --> 00:34:38,423
over its reality, and he cannot be harmed. That's
the Sandman. That was a lot of names to keep

383
00:34:38,463 --> 00:34:43,868
track of. There's a ton of characters in the
series, absolutely. I think there was like,

384
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:50,558
Kaliope and Lida, and they were people within
the story. I don't remember what they did.

385
00:34:50,718 --> 00:34:55,239
I'm sorry, did you have a hard time following
that? Yeah, because it was so many names. So

386
00:34:55,259 --> 00:35:00,641
many names. Just re-listen, just re-listen,
the names will catch on. All right, okay. Well,

387
00:35:00,721 --> 00:35:05,442
usually within your backstories, the name dropping
that you do are of characters that I know of

388
00:35:05,782 --> 00:35:10,703
and I have that context going. But with this
one, it was a lot of name dropping of characters

389
00:35:10,723 --> 00:35:15,185
that I didn't know and therefore had a hard
time keeping up. That's probably fair. The

390
00:35:15,225 --> 00:35:22,027
Sandman series took place in DC's Vertigo imprint.
for mature readers. So a majority of it exists

391
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:26,750
sort of outside of DC continuity, even though
it still is a part of that. So yeah, it's no

392
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:31,072
surprise that you weren't familiar with a lot
of the characters. And because of that, I feel

393
00:35:31,092 --> 00:35:36,495
like you didn't really ruin the Netflix show
for me. I literally just ruined all of it.

394
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:41,018
Well, I mean, then it doesn't seem like it's
gonna be that interesting then. Oh my gosh.

395
00:35:41,438 --> 00:35:46,321
I left out a ton of stuff. There's way more
to the Sandman series than what I said. I just

396
00:35:46,341 --> 00:35:51,504
gave you specifically. Sandman story, which
is why I stopped with his death. OK, I mean,

397
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:58,267
the entire like final volume of the series takes
place after dreams death. So there's a lot

398
00:35:58,287 --> 00:36:02,490
more to the story. OK. Well, I think the big
takeaway I took from it, though, is that dream

399
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:07,012
has died and can die and he's going to die again.
All right. Is what's going to happen if you

400
00:36:07,052 --> 00:36:13,236
chose to. OK, OK. You know who hasn't chosen
to die? Mephisto, because he's a winner. And

401
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:17,898
he's going to win this match. Let's hear about
him. All right. Mephisto. sometimes called

402
00:36:17,998 --> 00:36:24,460
Mephistopheles, Satan, Beelzebub, the Prince
of Lies, the Lord of Evil, and the Master of

403
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:29,561
Hell. He is the devil himself in the Marvel
Universe whose sole aim is to corrupt those

404
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:34,503
who are good and claim as many souls for his
netherworld. The true nature of Mephisto's

405
00:36:34,543 --> 00:36:39,504
inception is a mystery, though it's said he
is nearly as old as the universe itself, created

406
00:36:39,544 --> 00:36:45,702
by a force that had no concept of morality.
As a manifestation of pure evil, Mephisto drifted

407
00:36:45,742 --> 00:36:50,623
along the burgeoning cosmos and settled in the
molten mass that would one day form the planet

408
00:36:50,743 --> 00:36:56,905
Earth to form his hellish domain. Mephisto evolved
there into something like that of a fly, who

409
00:36:57,005 --> 00:37:02,006
billions of years ago witnessed a celestial
fall to the newly formed planet, infected by

410
00:37:02,046 --> 00:37:06,988
a cosmic disease that helped spread perversion
and grotesqueries across the Earth's barely

411
00:37:07,028 --> 00:37:12,549
evolved life. This helped the demon Mephisto
grow in power, influencing Earth's inhabitants

412
00:37:12,629 --> 00:37:19,169
toward damnation. the millennia, where he would
manifest to mankind's most hateful, most naive,

413
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:24,573
and most needy to grant them their desires and
manipulate them into selling their souls, for

414
00:37:24,633 --> 00:37:30,277
they were what Mephisto fed off of and gave
him power. As humanity developed their mythologies

415
00:37:30,377 --> 00:37:35,721
and religions, many of their dark deities were
based on Mephisto and he fed off that, in turn

416
00:37:35,781 --> 00:37:40,305
perpetuating their belief in a supreme evil,
shaping his appearance to fit their greatest

417
00:37:40,365 --> 00:37:45,635
fear of the devil. Other great demons would
rise to challenge him, and Mephisto was constantly

418
00:37:45,675 --> 00:37:51,878
at war with potential usurpers of his Hell Throne,
such as Thog, Satanish, and the demon Zerathos,

419
00:37:52,318 --> 00:37:57,120
whom Mephisto defeated and would one day bond
to Johnny Blaze the Ghost Rider, whom you can

420
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:02,302
learn more about in our Etrigan vs Ghost Rider
episode. Mephisto tempted and prodded the villains

421
00:38:02,342 --> 00:38:07,844
of Earth's past, including the powerful mutant
Apocalypse and the treacherous sorceress Morgan

422
00:38:07,884 --> 00:38:15,133
Le Fay. Mephisto grew fascinated with Earth's
developing superpowered heroes and their capacity

423
00:38:15,173 --> 00:38:21,217
to protect and inspire despite his unceasing
campaign to corrupt and destroy. During World

424
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:26,821
War II, he convinced Nazi scientists to open
a portal to his realm, assuring them it led

425
00:38:26,861 --> 00:38:32,564
to a race of perfect beings when it in fact
was his demonic horde. Mephisto confined the

426
00:38:32,604 --> 00:38:37,508
soul of Dr. Doom's mother in Hell and would
battle and defeat Doom every Halloween when

427
00:38:37,528 --> 00:38:42,231
the barrier between Earth and Hell's realms
were weakened. Eventually, Doctor Doom freed

428
00:38:42,271 --> 00:38:47,494
his mother by betraying his temporary ally,
Doctor Strange, offering Mephisto the Sorcerer's

429
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:52,838
Supreme Soul in exchange for his mother's. Mephisto
had become a long-standing enemy of Doctor

430
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:58,002
Strange and coveted his righteous soul, but
the hero was able to escape Mephisto's hellish

431
00:38:58,042 --> 00:39:02,405
grasp. You can learn more about Doctor Doom
and Doctor Strange in their respective dual

432
00:39:02,445 --> 00:39:07,788
episodes. Mephisto made many enemies over the
years, but desired most of all the pure spirit

433
00:39:07,828 --> 00:39:13,151
of the hero Silver Surfer. whom he tempted time
and again with riches and with his former love,

434
00:39:13,191 --> 00:39:18,452
Shalabal, but the surfer would never give in.
Mephisto fought the Fantastic Four and dragged

435
00:39:18,492 --> 00:39:23,413
Franklin, the son of Mr. Fantastic and Invisible
Woman, into Hell. The child's vast psychic

436
00:39:23,514 --> 00:39:28,415
and reality warping powers temporarily destroyed
Mephisto, however, and his essence was scattered

437
00:39:28,475 --> 00:39:33,416
into fragments. The mystical energies of two
of these fragments were unknowingly used to

438
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:38,958
create Billy and Tommy, the sons of Vision and
the Scarlet Witch. When Mephisto eventually

439
00:39:39,018 --> 00:39:44,280
reformed, he drew back all of his remaining
fragments, erasing Billy and Tommy from existence

440
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,621
to the Scarlet Witch's despair. Mephisto would
eventually create a son of his own, named Blackheart,

441
00:39:49,761 --> 00:39:54,683
who delighted in creating misery for heroes
such as Ghost Rider and Daredevil. Mephisto

442
00:39:54,703 --> 00:39:59,044
tried to teach his son how to rule hell, but
Blackheart rebelled and tried to overthrow

443
00:39:59,084 --> 00:40:04,450
his father and claim his throne, forcing Mephisto
to put him in his place. Mephisto developed

444
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:09,713
a strong rivalry for souls with other underworld
rulers, including Pluto, the Greek ruler of

445
00:40:09,753 --> 00:40:15,716
Hades, and Hela, the Asgardian ruler of Hel,
spelled H-E-L, one L. Right, not the double

446
00:40:15,736 --> 00:40:20,919
hockey stick. Right. When Hela attempted to
expand her realm to engulf the living, Mephisto

447
00:40:20,979 --> 00:40:25,702
temporarily stole Thor's soul and tormented
it, forcing him to witness the horrors of the

448
00:40:25,722 --> 00:40:30,524
underworld. After the God of Thunder was freed,
Thor vowed to forever stand against Hela and

449
00:40:30,604 --> 00:40:35,743
stopped her advances into Earth's realm. much
to Mephisto's delight. He was actually successful

450
00:40:35,783 --> 00:40:40,445
in getting Black Panther to sell his soul to
him for some assistance. However, Mephisto

451
00:40:40,465 --> 00:40:45,347
had no idea that the hero was forever tied to
Bast, the Panther God, and therefore was outsmarted

452
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:50,929
by the Wakandan King. One of Mephisto's greatest
successes though, was the eradication of the

453
00:40:50,969 --> 00:40:55,771
love between Spider-Man and Mary Jane Watson.
The couple sacrificed their marriage to him

454
00:40:55,891 --> 00:41:00,333
in order to save the life of Peter Parker's
Aunt May. Which is weird, she was gonna die

455
00:41:00,353 --> 00:41:05,961
anyway, she's old. To achieve this, Mephisto
erased the knowledge of Peter Parker's identity

456
00:41:06,021 --> 00:41:11,566
to the entire world. When the villainous organization
Hydra destroyed the city of Las Vegas, Dr.

457
00:41:11,606 --> 00:41:17,011
Strange restored it, and Mephisto used the opportunity
to manifest a piece of hell on Earth, called

458
00:41:17,131 --> 00:41:22,476
Hotel Inferno, where gamblers could bet their
very souls. This forced Dr. Strange to summon

459
00:41:22,536 --> 00:41:27,100
the Midnight Suns, a group of supernatural heroes
whom you can learn more about in our Justice

460
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:32,416
League Dark versus Midnight Suns dual episode.
While Mephisto battled the team on Earth, Ghost

461
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:37,680
Rider took over the Realm of Hell, cutting Mephisto
off from his power and he was imprisoned. But

462
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,404
ruling hell corrupted Johnny Blaze, and his
brother Danny Ketch and Doctor Strange were

463
00:41:42,424 --> 00:41:47,729
compelled to exercise and rescue him from the
underworld. As the heroes escaped hell, so

464
00:41:47,749 --> 00:41:53,234
did a horde of demons into Earth. They were
taken over, however, at the time by alien clintar

465
00:41:53,274 --> 00:41:58,666
symbiotes like Venom that were created by the
deity Null who was taken over Earth. Mephisto

466
00:41:58,686 --> 00:42:02,927
was then released from his prison to help fight
the symbiote-possessed demon horde, and then

467
00:42:02,967 --> 00:42:07,609
he returned to hell as its rightful ruler. And
that's his backstory. Powers-wise, Mephisto

468
00:42:07,649 --> 00:42:12,932
possesses nearly limitless supernatural power,
nearly unrivaled in the Marvel universe, energized

469
00:42:12,952 --> 00:42:18,074
by the evil of mankind and the souls he imprisons
in hell. With this power, he can manipulate

470
00:42:18,134 --> 00:42:23,216
his own form to take on any appearance or level
of strength. He can sense the morality of others

471
00:42:23,236 --> 00:42:30,508
from any distance and transport himself instantaneously
and across the galaxy. Mephisto can also cast

472
00:42:30,528 --> 00:42:35,892
illusions and manipulate reality around him
to fulfill almost any desire of one he's bargaining

473
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:41,797
with. This can range from psychic feats to power
enhancement, time manipulation, and so on.

474
00:42:42,098 --> 00:42:47,182
He wields Hellfire, which burns not only anything
physical, but anything metaphysical as well.

475
00:42:47,562 --> 00:42:53,287
Mephisto is immortal and virtually indestructible,
though if he is somehow destroyed, he reforms

476
00:42:53,327 --> 00:42:58,059
in his domain after a while where he is most
powerful. He can peer through time to see the

477
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:03,022
past and potential futures of his victims, and
he can trap people or their astral selves,

478
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:08,345
their souls, in hell. Finally, Mephisto does
have a couple of limitations despite his immense

479
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:12,909
power. He cannot force his will upon someone
without their permission, and the longer he

480
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:18,012
spends away from his realm, the weaker he becomes.
And those are his powers. Yeah, I'm not impressed.

481
00:43:18,092 --> 00:43:22,375
I'm not impressed. What? For a Sandman, like,
all that stuff is beneath him. He's way above,

482
00:43:22,415 --> 00:43:26,718
like, morality of, like, good and evil. It's
just trifling matters. You're talking about

483
00:43:26,758 --> 00:43:32,103
a guy who was trapped by an amateur magician
in a snow globe. It was ancient magic. And

484
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:35,546
apparently he doesn't have any of his powers
without his items, so I mean, good luck with

485
00:43:35,586 --> 00:43:40,270
that. Well, he undid that. Okay. Yeah, he learned
from that mistake. Alright, not too smart,

486
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:44,094
but whatever. Now that we got these characters'
histories and abilities out of the way, let's

487
00:43:44,114 --> 00:43:49,658
speculate on how one of the 1000 simulated matches
will go. The winner is determined by simulations,

488
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:53,954
not the speculation, but it's fun to imagine
how this fight could play out. We don't set

489
00:43:53,994 --> 00:43:57,777
any rules for this match other than the characters
don't know anything about each other going

490
00:43:57,977 --> 00:44:02,980
in, except that the other character is a threat
that needs to be put down. And we say that

491
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:08,664
they start off about 50 meters apart in an environment
that has no bearing on the match itself, because

492
00:44:08,684 --> 00:44:12,647
we don't take stats for the environment. Plus
certain characters have advantages in some

493
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:17,070
environments over others, and we want these
characters to win on their own merit. So let's

494
00:44:17,090 --> 00:44:22,518
get into it. Sandman and Mephisto meet on the
battlefield. Who goes first? Alright, as I

495
00:44:22,558 --> 00:44:26,319
mentioned earlier, I want to do something special
for this one, so I'm going to say Dream goes

496
00:44:26,359 --> 00:44:33,462
first, okay? Okay. Dream sees Mephisto and recognizes
him as a powerful lord of hell. Uninterested

497
00:44:33,642 --> 00:44:39,065
in coming to blows, Dream's going to make a
proposition. Since both beings are immensely

498
00:44:39,105 --> 00:44:43,767
powerful and a battle between them could truly
upset the fabric of the universe, Dream will

499
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:48,849
suggest that they instead play an ancient demons
game. It's the same one that Dream played in

500
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:54,521
hell to regain his helmet. Basically, they take
turns saying and describing that they are different

501
00:44:54,621 --> 00:45:00,746
things, each time saying that they are something
that can destroy or overcome what the opponent

502
00:45:00,826 --> 00:45:07,271
said, and so on and so forth until one of them
draws a blank. Whoever loses must see defeat

503
00:45:07,311 --> 00:45:13,757
and withdraw back to their realm defeated. Okay,
so kind of like our Riddler vs Arcade dual

504
00:45:13,797 --> 00:45:17,880
episode where we tried something a little bit
different. Instead of Mephisto and Sandman

505
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:24,132
throwing down with blows, they're going to play
a game of wits, as it were. Exactly. OK, I'm

506
00:45:24,432 --> 00:45:29,375
fine with that. Let's try it out. OK, so since
Dream came up with the idea for the game, for

507
00:45:29,415 --> 00:45:34,238
this match, how they're going to do it, he's
going to go first. All right. So he says, I

508
00:45:34,258 --> 00:45:42,382
am a dire wolf, prey stalking, lethal prowler.
OK, so then Mephisto, he transforms into a

509
00:45:42,462 --> 00:45:48,865
fiery dragon and says, I am a fire breathing
dragon who can consume the dire wolf with fire.

510
00:45:49,462 --> 00:45:55,484
Alright so then Dream transforms into a knight
and he says, I am a shining knight, armor wearing,

511
00:45:55,744 --> 00:46:02,987
dragon slaying. And then Mephisto turns into
an army tank. Uh huh. And says, I am a tank!

512
00:46:03,468 --> 00:46:10,171
Armor crushing, sword blocking, knight flattening.
Alright, a tank, alright. Dream turns into

513
00:46:10,351 --> 00:46:17,306
rust, alright. The tank just starts decaying
and he says, I am rust, metal decaying. And

514
00:46:17,346 --> 00:46:24,710
then Mephisto turns into a bottle of CLR. And
he was like, I am a bottle of CLR, which fights

515
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:30,133
the development of rust and protects your household
fixtures. This game's a little weird. I'm just

516
00:46:30,153 --> 00:46:38,857
gonna say it. Okay, so Sandman, he's gonna say,
I am a body of water, chemical diluting. Okay.

517
00:46:39,317 --> 00:46:44,480
And then Mephisto takes on the appearance of
the sun itself and says, I am the sun, water

518
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:49,964
evaporating. That's fine, because Dream could
just be like, I am a supernova, sun destroying,

519
00:46:50,244 --> 00:46:56,950
matter exploding. And then Mephisto turns into
this dark mass, becoming what's like a black

520
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:02,074
hole. And he's like, I'm a black hole, sucking
in that supernova and extinguishing all light.

521
00:47:02,094 --> 00:47:07,918
Okay, okay, so then Dream, he's gonna say, I
am the universe, all things encompassing, all

522
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:14,564
life embracing. And then Mephisto turns into
the ultimate nullifier, which can destroy the

523
00:47:14,604 --> 00:47:20,064
universe with but a point and click. It's a
weapon within the Marvel Comics universe. Okay,

524
00:47:20,484 --> 00:47:27,749
so then Sandman says, I am hope, unfailing,
never ending. And then Mephisto says, I am

525
00:47:27,809 --> 00:47:36,135
despair. No, it's unfailing hope. Okay, so then
Mephisto says, I am, but wait, how does hope

526
00:47:36,195 --> 00:47:42,643
defeat the ultimate nullifier? Anyway, it doesn't.
I mean, it does. That's how Sandman beat the

527
00:47:42,663 --> 00:47:47,467
demon in the comic when he made the universe
and from Anti-Life. That doesn't make any sense

528
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:55,532
either because if the universe is over, there's
nothing left to hope. Okay. Dream's probably

529
00:47:55,552 --> 00:48:01,877
like, fuck. So he's just gonna like throw a
fistful of sand right in Mephisto's face. Just

530
00:48:01,897 --> 00:48:09,343
putting him to sleep. Okay, so Mephisto's asleep.
I don't think Mephisto sleeps, but even if

531
00:48:09,363 --> 00:48:14,505
he did, let's say he couldn't overcome Dream's
sleep sand. I'm just gonna say Mephisto sleeps

532
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:18,587
with his eyes open because he's creepy like
that. That's- that's fine. Like, Dream has

533
00:48:18,647 --> 00:48:23,949
seen everything, alright? So, while Mephisto
is asleep, Dream's gonna transform the ground

534
00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:29,972
around Mephisto into like this magic quicksand,
this portal that causes Mephisto to sink into

535
00:48:30,052 --> 00:48:35,374
it and fall into the realm of the dreaming,
where Dream has complete control. So he's just

536
00:48:35,394 --> 00:48:40,355
gonna conjure some shackles on Mephisto. Well,
as the movie Inception taught me, you know,

537
00:48:40,455 --> 00:48:45,636
any falling experience is guaranteed to wake
you up. So if Mephisto's falling through the

538
00:48:45,676 --> 00:48:50,658
quicksand into the dreaming, he's gonna wake
up mid fall. So even before these shackles

539
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:55,379
can be placed, Mephisto from the air is gonna
like shoot this blast of hellfire at Dream,

540
00:48:55,719 --> 00:49:01,181
and hellfire burns not only the physical, but
also the metaphysical. So Dream's just like

541
00:49:01,281 --> 00:49:07,303
burning alive. Not in the dreaming, dude, okay?
Dream can't be harmed in his own realm. He

542
00:49:07,623 --> 00:49:12,625
literally writes the rules. It's Hellfire. Literally
he writes the rules. If he doesn't want Hellfire

543
00:49:12,645 --> 00:49:17,267
to hurt him, it's not gonna do it, all right?
So, you know, Dream, all this Hellfire is around

544
00:49:17,307 --> 00:49:22,569
him. He's just gonna like calmly gather like
all of the flames into like a lit candle. And

545
00:49:22,589 --> 00:49:27,211
then he'll blow out the candle and that's just
gonna extinguish like all of the lights all

546
00:49:27,251 --> 00:49:33,386
around them. So when Fisto can't see shit. And
then from the darkness, this horde of- nightmare

547
00:49:33,426 --> 00:49:38,008
creatures like with like teeth and tentacles
they emerge and they just start tearing the

548
00:49:38,028 --> 00:49:42,951
Mephisto apart. That's creepy. Heck yeah it
is. Heck yeah. But before that happens in the

549
00:49:42,991 --> 00:49:49,655
darkness this like fiery crack in the ground
appears beneath these nightmare creatures because

550
00:49:50,035 --> 00:49:54,938
Mephisto is opening a portal to hell. So the
rift widens and the creatures fall through

551
00:49:54,998 --> 00:50:00,801
it and also Mephisto and Dream also fall through
this fiery fissure into the realm of hell.

552
00:50:01,258 --> 00:50:06,900
So now they're in Mephisto's domain. Okay. And
Dream falls into this area of hell called the

553
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:14,003
Arena of Tainted Souls, where souls do battle
for Mephisto's pleasure. So Mephisto's watching

554
00:50:14,063 --> 00:50:19,525
from his throne above this pit area and Dream
looks up and all of a sudden, guess what? There's

555
00:50:19,545 --> 00:50:24,867
this like giant Gladiator Kaiju demon troll
monster that he has to now fight. He's fighting

556
00:50:24,907 --> 00:50:29,669
a demon in hell now? Yeah. So Dream, he's just
gonna be like, all right, let's play a demon

557
00:50:29,709 --> 00:50:36,632
game. Demon's gonna be like, no! And then just
like smash him. Like these demons don't know

558
00:50:36,652 --> 00:50:41,855
this fucking demon game that he keeps talking
about. These are hardcore demons. Okay, but

559
00:50:41,875 --> 00:50:45,977
before Dream gets smashed, he's just gonna like
let out a breath from his palm, all right?

560
00:50:46,257 --> 00:50:51,140
And that's gonna blow the demon away. And this
wind gust is gonna turn into like a massive

561
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:56,323
storm, a tempest with heavy rain that's still
pouring in from that portal above them from

562
00:50:56,363 --> 00:51:00,965
the Dreaming. And it's just gonna flood the
entirety of hell, like almost instantly, all

563
00:51:00,985 --> 00:51:06,503
right? And with another breath, Dream, he's
gonna freeze hell, which is flooded, cutting

564
00:51:06,583 --> 00:51:11,744
off Mephisto from access to his souls since
they're frozen and trapped. Sandman literally

565
00:51:12,344 --> 00:51:17,886
made hell freeze over. Oh, wow, that's pretty
clever, I like that. But even if Mephisto is

566
00:51:17,926 --> 00:51:22,987
cut off from his power source, he's not powerless,
his power is just diminishing. So with hell

567
00:51:23,027 --> 00:51:28,229
frozen over, Mephisto is just gonna like burn
his way to the surface of the ice where Dream

568
00:51:28,309 --> 00:51:34,412
is, and he's gonna like burn this Pentagram
sigil thing into the ice beneath dream just

569
00:51:34,432 --> 00:51:40,637
like the Magus guy did Roger Caburgis. Yeah.
Yeah and Mephisto telekinetically yanks away

570
00:51:40,658 --> 00:51:44,401
dreams bag of sand dream is trapped in hell.
How did I know you were gonna do that? Yep,

571
00:51:44,421 --> 00:51:49,024
I didn't you're gonna pull that move match over.
All right Okay, so all this happens and Mephisto

572
00:51:49,044 --> 00:51:54,609
is feeling pretty good about himself and then
he fucking wakes up. No Yeah, I know you're

573
00:51:54,629 --> 00:51:59,673
gonna do that is all a dream. He's actually
still in the dreaming shackled and powerless

574
00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:05,455
forever imprisoned in Dream's dungeon. So he's
the one who's trapped. We'll agree to disagree.

575
00:52:05,735 --> 00:52:10,179
We'll go ahead and end the match there and run
the stats on these characters. Either Dream

576
00:52:10,219 --> 00:52:17,207
is forever trapped by a sigil in hell or Mephisto
is forever trapped in the dreaming powerless

577
00:52:17,287 --> 00:52:21,871
and cut off from his souls. Exactly. So let's
go ahead and run these simulations and we'll

578
00:52:21,891 --> 00:52:24,013
come back with a winner to find out what really
happened.

579
00:52:28,638 --> 00:52:35,743
Okay, we're back and these are some pretty powerful
guys. Oh yeah. Both Mephisto and Sandman are

580
00:52:36,103 --> 00:52:40,787
omnipotent essentially within their own realms,
but they're no slouches when it comes to fighting

581
00:52:40,927 --> 00:52:45,690
outside of the realm such as on Earth. Except
when it comes to the stat category of fighting

582
00:52:46,050 --> 00:52:51,234
in which both of them kind of suck because they
don't really throw hands. Right, exactly. So

583
00:52:51,294 --> 00:52:56,878
they're pretty much maxed out in all categories
except for fighting skill. We did say there

584
00:52:56,918 --> 00:53:02,823
was some disparity between Mephisto and Sandman's
durability. While outside their realm, it seems

585
00:53:02,843 --> 00:53:08,028
like Sandman is a little bit more vulnerable
than Mephisto. Yeah. But we did say that since

586
00:53:08,068 --> 00:53:14,113
Sandman knows the subconscious of every being
in existence due to ruling the Dreaming, he

587
00:53:14,133 --> 00:53:19,637
has slightly higher perception of his opponents
than Mephisto does, who often has to ask people.

588
00:53:20,010 --> 00:53:23,751
what they desire most or what they need or what
they fear, whereas Sandman already knows this.

589
00:53:23,971 --> 00:53:28,672
Yeah, he knows everyone's story. It's literally
a book in his library. So their stats came

590
00:53:28,712 --> 00:53:33,374
out not too dissimilar in terms of their overall
ability. It's gonna be a really close match

591
00:53:33,414 --> 00:53:37,035
here. Well, let's find out. I have the results
right here. Who do you think came out on top?

592
00:53:37,515 --> 00:53:42,236
I think, I don't know. I have no idea, honestly.
I wanna say Mephisto, but I'm not entirely

593
00:53:42,276 --> 00:53:47,802
sure. I think it's too close to call, honestly.
But our Instagram followers. said in our poll

594
00:53:47,842 --> 00:53:53,545
on the matter that Mephisto would win by 57%
over Dream. Which actually really surprised

595
00:53:53,585 --> 00:53:58,628
me because like Sandman has his TV show out
right now. I'm not sure why people are rooting

596
00:53:58,648 --> 00:54:02,610
for Mephisto at all. I guess he was a character
in the Ghost Rider movie. Yeah, Mephisto was

597
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:07,973
in Ghost Rider and Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance.
Well, let's hear the results. The winner of

598
00:54:07,993 --> 00:54:12,076
the matchup between Sandman and Mephisto is...

599
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:22,094
Yeah, you see what I did there? See what I did
there? But barely, though, barely. Laphisto

600
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:32,821
won 51.9% of the 1000 matches. Oh. So 519 wins
compared to Sandman's 481 wins or 48.1% win

601
00:54:32,881 --> 00:54:37,825
rate. And what was the defining factor in this
match? Honestly, there really wasn't one. Again,

602
00:54:37,845 --> 00:54:43,589
they were pretty evenly matched when it came
to the stats. It's a coin toss and fucking

603
00:54:43,669 --> 00:54:49,208
as usual. Marvel comes out on top. Most of the
time, yeah. I kind of like my luck for sure.

604
00:54:49,588 --> 00:54:55,091
But guess what Jonathan? Jonathan, guess what?
What? Mephisto confirmed to be better than

605
00:54:55,151 --> 00:55:02,274
Sandman. How do you feel about that? Hashtag
Mephisto confirmed. Everybody hashtag Mephisto

606
00:55:02,294 --> 00:55:07,857
confirmed with no context. Just, you know, spread
the conjecture. This hurts. I am not going

607
00:55:07,877 --> 00:55:12,388
to lie. You know, Dream definitely has like
a rivalry with Lucifer in the comics where

608
00:55:12,408 --> 00:55:16,550
he's basically said that Lucifer is like the
second most powerful being in the universe

609
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:21,653
next to the creator, the presence. Uh-huh. So
I guess it kind of makes sense that Mephisto

610
00:55:21,673 --> 00:55:26,876
would win considering he's kind of Marvel's
equivalent of Lucifer. But, uh, yeah, it's

611
00:55:26,916 --> 00:55:32,739
still stupid. At least Sandman is a way better
story than any Mephisto story. I don't know

612
00:55:32,759 --> 00:55:36,881
about the- oh, honestly, I've never read any
of Sandman's stories. But, uh, I'm trying to

613
00:55:36,901 --> 00:55:43,607
think like the- probably the best Mephisto story.
I think would probably be Faust, nothing from

614
00:55:43,647 --> 00:55:48,011
Marvel. No, I'm talking about Marvel story.
Nah, none of them are good. I think Triumph

615
00:55:48,031 --> 00:55:52,735
and Torment was pretty good with Doctor Strange
and Doctor Doom. If you wanna read a good Mephisto

616
00:55:52,755 --> 00:55:59,460
story, that was pretty good. Yawn, I fell asleep.
Just hearing about that. All right. But that

617
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:03,063
does it for this duel guys. Let us know what

one of The Sandman, which is on Netflix. And

625
00:56:42,433 --> 00:56:47,155
it's good, it's good. I've watched the first
three episodes, the first one I didn't love,

626
00:56:47,215 --> 00:56:50,977
but it definitely picks up by episode three.
I'm looking forward to the rest of it. It gets

627
00:56:50,997 --> 00:56:54,338
better and better. I can't wait to talk about
it. But that does it for this episode. We wanna
