in the Dynamite Podcast Network. But with that

43
00:04:03,352 --> 00:04:09,699
out of the way, quick to the no prize. A no
prize is an award Marvel used to give out to

44
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:15,682
fans. Our version, the Dynamic Dual No Prize,
is a digital award we post on Instagram and

45
00:04:15,742 --> 00:04:20,625
in our email newsletter for the person that
we feel gave the best answer to our question

46
00:04:20,665 --> 00:04:25,868
of the week. Last week's question we asked,
who would you cast as the sentry in the MCU's

47
00:04:25,948 --> 00:04:29,650
Thunderbolts film? And that's coming off of
the news that Steven Yeun has departed that

48
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,812
role for that movie. You got a lot of great
answers. Let's go ahead and run down our honorable

49
00:04:33,852 --> 00:04:39,596
mentions as well as the no prize winner. Our
first honorable mention goes to Scott Camacho,

50
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:44,118
who said, I'm going to go ahead and state the
obvious and say Henry Cavill. I mean, he's

51
00:04:44,178 --> 00:04:49,401
worked with Superman. So, you know, he has the
goody two shoes parts of Sentry. And for the

52
00:04:49,561 --> 00:04:55,825
void, his work with the Witcher and being a
villain in Mission Impossible, I think he has

53
00:04:55,845 --> 00:05:01,668
the acting chops and the star power to pull
that character off. So I've heard this answer

54
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:06,852
before and I've always hated it. But now who
we know that Henry Cavill is not returning

55
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:11,235
to the role of Superman. Sure. Why not make
him the century? I actually think that would

56
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:16,380
be really cool. And I would love to see the
actor again in a superhero role. Absolutely.

57
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,624
I mean, the guy is very superhero esque in his
appearance. I think he'd be a fantastic century.

58
00:05:21,924 --> 00:05:28,770
The character is often seen as an analog to
DC's Superman. So, yeah, if he played Superman

59
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:33,570
for DC, let's have him play the analog for Marvel.
I think he'd be a great get. It would also

60
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:40,254
be like the ultimate troll from Marvel 2 Warner
Brothers. Exactly, exactly. I'm surprised actually

61
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:43,235
Jonathan you're going along with this because
I think it's a great idea. Well this would

62
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:48,238
be punishment for not hashtag restoring the
Snyderverse. WB gets what's coming to them.

63
00:05:48,678 --> 00:05:53,521
Great answer Scott Camacho. Our next honorable
mention goes to his twin brother, Gil Camacho.

64
00:05:53,881 --> 00:05:59,484
Who said? Hey guys, Gilimacho here. I know a
lot of people are probably thinking Henry Cavill

65
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:05,312
should be a good recruit for Sentry. just so
we can punch a gut to DC. But since we both

66
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:10,856
have Luke and Chris Hemsworth, I think it should
be Liam Hemsworth. All right, guys, thank you.

67
00:06:11,516 --> 00:06:16,961
Yeah, why not round out the Hemsworth brother
trio and get Liam Hemsworth in the role as

68
00:06:16,981 --> 00:06:22,124
the Sentry. Now, some people may balk at the
idea of casting both brothers in the MCU, but

69
00:06:22,164 --> 00:06:28,109
there's precedent given that Luke plays the
thespian version of Thor in Thor Ragnarok and

70
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:32,555
Love and Thunder. But also, the Sentry kinda
looks like Thor in the comic books. You know,

71
00:06:32,735 --> 00:06:37,556
they're both like big buff dudes with long blonde
hair. Although Liam Hemsworth does look kinda

72
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:42,257
weird with long light colored hair. Have you
seen him as the Witcher? It's weird! No. Hahaha.

73
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:47,499
I don't think it's a bad option. I think it's
a pretty solid option. I think it could work,

74
00:06:47,559 --> 00:06:54,101
yeah. Great answer, Gil. Our final honorable
mention goes to Matt Estes, who said... Hey

75
00:06:54,141 --> 00:07:00,907
guys, Matt Estes here. Hey, I think Alexander
Ludwig. From Vikings, he played Bjorn Ironside,

76
00:07:00,987 --> 00:07:06,911
would be a great pick for this entry. He's got
the look and he's got the acting chops. Yeah,

77
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:11,414
offhand, I didn't remember who Alexander Ludwig
was until I looked him up, but I totally recognize

78
00:07:11,434 --> 00:07:18,358
him as the main villain of the first Hunger
Games movie, and from Vikings. The guy looks

79
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:23,041
the part of this entry to a T. He has some big
roles under his belt, and also, I don't think

80
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:28,452
he'll cost Marvel a dime. Yeah, honestly, there
are a lot of actors from the Vikings series

81
00:07:28,672 --> 00:07:33,154
that can play superhero roles. I'm still waiting
for Katherine Winnick to join DC in some kind

82
00:07:33,194 --> 00:07:37,557
of role. She needs to be there. She's awesome.
Yeah, I remember when she was the front runner

83
00:07:37,597 --> 00:07:41,939
on my wishlist to play Captain Marvel. But great
answer, Matt Estes. We want to give a quick

84
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:48,322
shout out to Mitchell Smoothie, Cornelius Robinson,
and Corey Wooten for taking the time to visit

85
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:53,385
our website and record your answers. But the
winner of this week's Snow Prize is... John

86
00:07:53,425 --> 00:07:59,062
Spees. and Ryan McMullen, who both gave the
same answer. Let's hear both of them. Hey guys,

87
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:06,087
John Speas here. My pick for the century would
be Alexander Skarsgård. I know his father's

88
00:08:06,107 --> 00:08:13,033
already been in the MCU, but Alexander is tall.
We know he can get fit from his time as Tarzan,

89
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:18,418
and he's got that Swedish blonde hair that I
think would work really, really well. So he

90
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:24,935
is my pick, Alexander Skarsgård. Hey guys, it's
Ryan McMullen here. Hi. choice for the Sentry

91
00:08:24,975 --> 00:08:30,538
would be Alexander Skarsgard because that guy's
got the look, right? He could definitely be

92
00:08:30,558 --> 00:08:35,661
the Sentry. Nobody else hands down is him. Yeah,
both of these are great answers. Not only does

93
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:41,124
Alexander Skarsgard have the look though, he
also has the intensity, I believe, for the

94
00:08:41,164 --> 00:08:47,088
role, which would be required to play a mentally
unstable character like the Sentry. Oh sure,

95
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:51,274
yeah, did you see him in the Northman? That
was a great role for him. No, but I saw the

96
00:08:51,314 --> 00:08:57,035
trailer for Infinity Pool because I was too
afraid to watch the movie and holy shit, this

97
00:08:57,075 --> 00:09:02,037
guy could act. Yeah, he's a leading man. I have
no doubt that he would make the perfect century

98
00:09:02,157 --> 00:09:08,279
and I think a lot of fans would be super excited
to see him in the role because he is to a T

99
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:12,640
the perfect century. It needs to happen. You
know, I did see him in recently that I thought

100
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:19,170
he was really good in the final season of Succession.
He was incredible in that role. like really

101
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:23,753
menacing and like really intelligent. So yeah,
that's the perfect way to describe the century.

102
00:09:24,033 --> 00:09:30,157
If Kevin Feige cast Alexander Skarsgard in the
role of the century like tomorrow, I guarantee

103
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:35,961
you MCU stock would go up. Fans would be all
over that. Absolutely, yeah. It would save

104
00:09:35,981 --> 00:09:42,286
the box office. Do it Kevin Feige, do it for
the fans. So congrats to John Spees and Ryan

105
00:09:42,326 --> 00:09:46,769
McMullen. John is a long time friend of the
show. You know, him and his brother Adam have

106
00:09:46,849 --> 00:09:53,745
guessed it on. this podcast on numerous occasions.
They recently ended their nostalgic movie podcast,

107
00:09:54,065 --> 00:09:59,969
The Blast From Our Past, and we are super sad
to see it gone. And Ryan McMullen, I think

108
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:03,812
this is the first time we've heard from you.
Way to crush it out of the gate. Absolutely.

109
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:07,334
If you, the listener, want a shot at winning
your own no prize, stay tuned to later on this

110
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:12,157
episode when we'll be asking another Question
of the Week. And now that that's done, on to

111
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:12,737
the news.

112
00:10:18,318 --> 00:10:24,020
Alright this past week we got some awesome news
in regards to the Disney Plus upcoming television

113
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:29,382
show Daredevil Born Again. Now we learned like
a couple months ago that the entire series

114
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:35,144
is being retooled under the new showrunner Dario
Scartapin and with that news Jeff Snyder is

115
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:41,767
reporting via his blog The Insnyder that Deborah
Ann Wall and Elden Hansen will be reprising

116
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:48,342
their roles as Karen Page and Foggy Nelson in
the upcoming Daredevil season. Fantastic. Yeah,

117
00:10:48,362 --> 00:10:52,903
it's super exciting because previously we had
heard the exact opposite of that, that they

118
00:10:53,003 --> 00:10:58,064
weren't returning because then Disney would
have had to have paid the old Netflix writers

119
00:10:58,444 --> 00:11:03,606
as like creators of the show. Yeah, something
weird like that. But I'm glad that Skardepain

120
00:11:03,646 --> 00:11:08,307
realized that Foggy Nelson and Karen Page were
a huge part of the appeal from the Netflix

121
00:11:08,347 --> 00:11:13,788
series. The chemistry between those three cast
members was spot on and a big part of what

122
00:11:13,808 --> 00:11:18,670
made the show enjoyable. Yeah, totally. I really
hope that this means that The Netflix series

123
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:24,856
is made canon in the MCU. That would be fantastic.
Well, interestingly enough, if you go onto

124
00:11:24,876 --> 00:11:31,101
the Disney Plus Marvel Hub page, the Netflix
series have been added to the official Marvel

125
00:11:31,121 --> 00:11:37,307
timeline in their menu. A what? Yeah, so it
looks like those shows are actually being treated

126
00:11:37,367 --> 00:11:43,952
as canon now. Wait, even Iron Fist? Even Iron
Fist. Whoa. Now, of course, that doesn't guarantee

127
00:11:43,972 --> 00:11:48,816
that the actors will be. cast the same in future
appearances. But we know that a lot are returning,

128
00:11:49,096 --> 00:11:54,199
including Charlie Cox, now Deborah Anwalt, Elden
Hansen, Jon Bernthal will be returning as the

129
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:58,983
Punisher, as it's expected that he will still
retain his cameo on the Daredevil born again

130
00:11:59,023 --> 00:12:02,925
series. And there are also rumors that Kristen
Ritter will be returning as Jessica Jones in

131
00:12:02,945 --> 00:12:08,169
a cameo. So lots to look forward to. Super excited
with the new direction that Dario Scartapin

132
00:12:08,209 --> 00:12:13,131
has taken this series. and really bringing Marvel
fans what they want. The series doesn't currently

133
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:18,513
have a premiere date yet, but it's expected
to come out in 2025. Can't wait for that. Of

134
00:12:18,553 --> 00:12:22,735
course, if you want your immediate Daredevil
fix, you can see him for approximately 90 seconds

135
00:12:23,296 --> 00:12:28,318
as he cameos in the Echo television show. I
haven't seen that yet. Is it really only 90

136
00:12:28,358 --> 00:12:34,701
seconds? Yeah, it's only for one fight scene.
What a rip off. I guess if you really want

137
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:38,691
your Daredevil fix, just rewatch the Netflix
series. There you go. But speaking of Karen

138
00:12:38,711 --> 00:12:42,717
Page and Foggy Nelson returning to the show,
that brings us to our question of the week.

139
00:12:47,158 --> 00:12:51,961
What other character from the Daredevil Netflix
series do you most hope returns for Disney

and we're recording the next episode a little
early.

147
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,617
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and get into

148
00:13:35,677 --> 00:13:41,029
our main event, where we find out who'd win
between the villain characters of Livewire

149
00:13:41,671 --> 00:13:42,613
and Claw.

150
00:13:57,794 --> 00:14:02,375
Alright, Livewire versus Claw, as I mentioned
at the top of this episode, these are two energy

151
00:14:02,415 --> 00:14:07,296
beings, one of them being made out of electricity
and one of them being made out of sound. I'm

152
00:14:07,316 --> 00:14:13,218
a little bit nervous about how this speculation
is going to go considering that these two characters

153
00:14:13,538 --> 00:14:18,199
don't really have a physical essence that can
be permanently harmed, I think. Yeah, how does

154
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,281
one energy form damage another energy form?
I have no idea. We'll find out. We'll figure

155
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:30,318
something out. Of course, Livewire is a Superman
villain who was first introduced in the Superman,

156
00:14:30,358 --> 00:14:34,481
the animated series back in the 90s. She was
an original character that has kind of stuck

157
00:14:34,521 --> 00:14:39,126
around in the comics. Yeah, kind of like Harley
Quinn. Yeah, yeah. Whereas Klaw has been a

158
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:44,350
primary villain for Black Panther since his
first iteration. He was portrayed by Andy Serkis

159
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:49,375
in the Black Panther movie as well as Avengers
Age of Ultron. Yeah, but the character is pretty

160
00:14:49,435 --> 00:14:54,091
different in the comics as far as I'm aware.
Yeah, he is like... Klaue in the movies was

161
00:14:54,231 --> 00:15:00,055
an arms dealer whose hand was severed by Ultron,
whereas in the comics, Klaue is more of a scientist

162
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:05,019
whose hand was actually taken by T'Challa himself.
But we'll learn more about the character shortly.

163
00:15:05,079 --> 00:15:10,563
Before that, to explain the methodology behind
our duels, let's go to our sentient duel simulator,

164
00:15:10,763 --> 00:15:17,468
Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K, tell our listeners
how you go about determining a winner in our

165
00:15:17,528 --> 00:15:22,639
duel matchups. Yes, of course, sir. The way
I determine a winner between the contestants

166
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:28,723
is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations using
the characters statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation

167
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:34,487
is a probabilistic model used to determine outcomes
through random sampling. In this case, I randomise

168
00:15:34,507 --> 00:15:38,950
the statistics along a normal distribution as
a way to simulate the many variables that can

169
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:43,873
occur during battle. The stat parameters are
based on the official Marvel power grid from

170
00:15:43,893 --> 00:15:49,017
which the DC characters statistics are extrapolated.
Additional stat categories are included such

171
00:15:49,057 --> 00:15:54,556
as range, damage potential, versatility and
perception in order to create a more detailed

172
00:15:54,576 --> 00:15:59,698
and accurate simulation. The results of the
1000 simulations provide a percentage of wins

173
00:15:59,718 --> 00:16:04,180
for each character. The contestant with the
higher percentage is declared the victor as

174
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:09,543
they have a higher probability to win any given
battle. In an equitable pairing, neither character

175
00:16:09,563 --> 00:16:14,285
should win 100% of the matches. The comic book
stories have shown that there's even a way

176
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:19,355
for Batman to defeat Superman. So the confidence
rate of my method falls in line with the precedents

177
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:24,418
that have been established in the source material.
My mathematical simulations are without subjectivity

178
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:29,821
or bias. Feats are not the sole consideration,
nor are fan votes tabulated for determination

179
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:35,124
of the winner. Thanks AJ9K. Before we run the
simulations though, we like to break down each

180
00:16:35,144 --> 00:16:39,566
character's histories and abilities before improvising
a scenario on how we imagine one of the 1000

181
00:16:39,907 --> 00:16:44,029
simulations would play out beat for beat. And
I believe it's my turn to go first with the

182
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:51,135
DC character. So let me tell you all about Livewire.
Metropolis's radio shock jock DJ, Leslie Willis,

183
00:16:51,295 --> 00:16:56,877
made a name for herself bashing Superman, claiming
that he only saved people for attention seeking

184
00:16:57,117 --> 00:17:03,019
and less than altruistic reasons. At the height
of her popularity, the owner of the radio station,

185
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:10,561
Miguel Sendoza, decided to switch to a country
music format and he fired Leslie, in part because

186
00:17:10,601 --> 00:17:15,815
his wife had been saved by Superman a week prior.
and he didn't appreciate Leslie's success.

187
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:23,040
Unbeknownst to Miguel, Leslie was a metahuman
capable of absorbing and redirecting electromagnetic

188
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:28,484
waves, and after electrocuting her producer,
Leslie went to the roof of the radio station's

189
00:17:28,524 --> 00:17:34,569
building and climbed its antenna in an attempt
to disrupt the signal coming from it. She was

190
00:17:34,629 --> 00:17:40,433
struck by lightning on the tower, however, and
her nervous system, unable to absorb that level

191
00:17:40,473 --> 00:17:46,669
of electricity. was converted into pure electrical
energy. Thrilled by her transformation and

192
00:17:46,809 --> 00:17:52,293
overcome by power, Leslie decided to attack
Superman while he was searching for Lois Lane,

193
00:17:52,593 --> 00:17:58,538
who had been kidnapped by Leslie's brother.
Initially overwhelmed by Leslie's power, Superman

194
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:03,641
managed to defeat her by seeding a cloud with
ice particles, transforming it into a storm

195
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:09,894
cloud that generated a lightning bolt that shorted
Leslie's body, just in time to save Lois. You

196
00:18:09,914 --> 00:18:15,518
can learn more about Superman in our Superman
vs. Dr. Doom episode. Leslie was later kidnapped,

197
00:18:15,578 --> 00:18:21,744
along with many other metahumans, by an alien
known as the Auctioneer, who captured and sold

198
00:18:21,904 --> 00:18:27,568
unique beings across the universe. After successfully
shorting the power source to her containment

199
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:34,270
field, Leslie was able to escape and help Earth's
heroes such as Superman and Mr. Terrific. defeat

200
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:39,394
the Auctioneer by taking over his ship's communication
systems, and she was able to broadcast their

201
00:18:39,434 --> 00:18:45,259
victory to Earth. After having been seen partnered
with the heroes, Leslie decided to turn over

202
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:51,004
a new leaf and agreed to be studied by Star
Labs. Her power levels fluctuated over time

203
00:18:51,325 --> 00:18:56,429
as her entire body began converting to energy,
which slowly caused her to become mentally

204
00:18:56,529 --> 00:19:03,782
unbalanced. She escaped Star Labs and took hostages
in Las Vegas. demanding a ransom of all the

205
00:19:03,822 --> 00:19:09,205
money in the town. Jimmy Olsen happened to be
in Las Vegas at the time, and after he summoned

206
00:19:09,285 --> 00:19:15,047
Superman and he and Leslie fought, Superman
managed to get Leslie into a containment suit

207
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:20,669
that he wore during a time in the 90s when he
himself was also an electrical energy being.

208
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:26,312
I remember that electric blue Superman, yeah.
The containment suit instantly helped regulate

209
00:19:26,372 --> 00:19:32,663
Leslie's energy and her sanity was restored.
Soon after, Leslie became a member of the Superman

210
00:19:32,723 --> 00:19:38,388
of America, a team Superman put together after
traveling the United States and realizing he

211
00:19:38,428 --> 00:19:44,433
can't be everywhere all the time. In post-Flashpoint
continuity, Leslie was given a new origin.

212
00:19:44,853 --> 00:19:50,718
No longer a radio shock jock, but a streaming
personality and vlogger made famous for her

213
00:19:50,778 --> 00:19:56,323
makeup tutorials and pranks. For one of her
pranks, Leslie broke into Metropolis's main

214
00:19:56,363 --> 00:20:03,106
power station and took control of the with the
intention of turning off all of its power except

215
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:09,008
for one illuminated, obscene message that could
be seen from space. Superman interrupted the

216
00:20:09,068 --> 00:20:15,270
stream, however, and Leslie accidentally electrocuted
herself with enough electricity to power Metropolis.

217
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:21,012
Blaming Superman for what had happened to her,
she fought him a number of times before Batman

218
00:20:21,052 --> 00:20:26,373
created an energy-diffusion prison for her on
Stryker's Island. A cult managed to siphon

219
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:31,283
her out of prison, however, and Batgirl was
forced to bring her down with her father Commissioner

220
00:20:31,343 --> 00:20:37,665
Gordon when he was Batman for a time. And that's
Livewire's brief history. She hasn't been around

221
00:20:37,706 --> 00:20:44,368
for a long time. Powers-wise, Livewire is a
being of pure electromagnetic energy, making

222
00:20:44,408 --> 00:20:50,731
her immune to most physical attacks. She can
absorb, store, and project electrical energy

223
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:56,433
strong enough to affect Superman, though high-voltage
attacks do use up a substantial amount of her

224
00:20:56,513 --> 00:21:02,356
energy. and forces her to recharge by absorbing
additional electrical energy elsewhere. She

225
00:21:02,396 --> 00:21:07,718
is able to phase through most solid matter and
can travel along power lines or other forms

226
00:21:07,758 --> 00:21:13,320
of circuitry. She could also imbue machines
and devices with her own electrical energy

227
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:19,202
to take control of them. She can naturally emit
radio waves, and she can charge objects with

228
00:21:19,262 --> 00:21:22,024
electromagnetic energy to make them magnetic.

229
00:21:27,026 --> 00:21:32,831
and cannot affect insulated objects. That's
LiveWire. I like how her origin was updated

230
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:36,935
from a shock jock, which is what it was from
the cartoon, if I remember correctly, to an

231
00:21:37,015 --> 00:21:42,299
influencer. Yeah, a wannabe influencer, essentially.
Yeah, that's pretty great. I didn't know she

232
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:46,944
was a technopath, though. I didn't know she
could control other electronic devices. Yes.

233
00:21:46,964 --> 00:21:51,348
I guess that makes sense. Yeah, she does that
pretty frequently with TV screens, or just

234
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:56,207
screens of any kind, really. Okay. She like
invades their systems and then like she can

235
00:21:56,307 --> 00:22:01,010
speak to people through screens. It's pretty
cool. Yeah, this is gonna be a difficult fight

236
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:06,673
because let me tell you about Klaue's history
and powers. Ulysses Klaue was born in Belgium,

237
00:22:06,973 --> 00:22:12,737
the son of Fritz Klaue, a former Hydra Colonel
who in World War II joined Baron Strucker in

238
00:22:12,777 --> 00:22:17,960
an attempted invasion of the African nation
of Wakanda in order to learn its secrets. The

239
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,794
Klaue family had a history with the as Ulysses'
great-great-great grandfather had a run-in

240
00:22:23,814 --> 00:22:29,456
with the Wakandans in the 1800s and never returned
home to tell about it. Fritz, his father, was

241
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:34,497
slightly luckier as he was able to barely escape
Wakanda with his life. Returning home to Belgium,

242
00:22:34,858 --> 00:22:40,499
Fritz raised Ulysses with tales of the formidable
African nation and instilled in his son an

243
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:45,621
intense hatred for Wakanda and its leader, the
Black Panther. You can learn more about the

244
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:51,115
Black Panther in his dual episode against Black
Manta. Something of a science prodigy, Ulysses

245
00:22:51,155 --> 00:22:56,260
studied physics as a young adult, specializing
in the field of applied sonics at the Technical

246
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:01,985
University of Delft in the Netherlands. There,
he designed a sound transducer able to convert

247
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:07,610
the vibrational waves of sound into physical
mass. However, the device would require vibranium

248
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:12,714
in order to function, vibranium being a rare
metal found only in the nation of Wakanda that

249
00:23:12,754 --> 00:23:17,891
can absorb kinetic energy. Eager to get his
hands on the metal? Ulysses enlisted a group

250
00:23:17,931 --> 00:23:23,236
of mercenaries and fashioned a sonic blaster.
He and the mercenaries journeyed to the Wakandan

251
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:29,201
border, where they were confronted by its then-king
and Black Panther, T'Chaka. When the king was

252
00:23:29,281 --> 00:23:35,067
overpowered by Ulysses' sonic blaster, 13-year-old
Prince T'Challa jumped in the fight to help.

253
00:23:35,587 --> 00:23:40,552
As Ulysses fired his weapon on the young prince,
T'Chaka leapt in the way of the blast and was

254
00:23:40,632 --> 00:23:46,193
killed, protecting his son. In retaliation,
Wakandan warrior Zuri impaled Ulysses right

255
00:23:46,273 --> 00:23:52,138
arm with a spear, causing him to drop his sonic
blaster. Young T'Challa then picked it up and

256
00:23:52,238 --> 00:23:58,003
used it to blow off Ulysses hand and force the
villain to retreat. In the end, Ulysses did

257
00:23:58,043 --> 00:24:03,228
obtain a small sample of vibranium, but more
importantly, earned an enemy for life in Prince

258
00:24:03,248 --> 00:24:08,473
T'Challa, who would grow up to become the new
king of Wakanda and the Black Panther. Ulysses

259
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:12,955
spent the next few years building his sound
transducer that could convert sound waves into

260
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:18,238
solid form and equipping it into a prosthetic
device to replace his missing right hand. He

261
00:24:18,258 --> 00:24:22,561
attempted to invade Wakanda again, this time
getting at the source of all vibranium called

262
00:24:22,621 --> 00:24:28,104
the Great Mound, and bombarded Wakanda with
a horde of sound energy creature constructs,

263
00:24:28,584 --> 00:24:33,287
which Ulysses referred to as Echoes. However,
Black Panther was able to track the source

264
00:24:33,327 --> 00:24:38,918
of these Echoes to Ulysses' secret lab which
he blew up, seemingly killing Ulysses. As it

265
00:24:38,938 --> 00:24:43,800
turned out, however, the villain's consciousness
survived as his body was transformed by his

266
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:49,542
transducer into a being made entirely out of
sound, now able to shape and control vibrational

267
00:24:49,582 --> 00:24:54,945
forces at will. With his new abilities, he set
his sights on the Fantastic Four and Mr. Fantastic's

268
00:24:55,025 --> 00:25:00,207
inventions. Though Ulysses was able to trap
the team in a force field, the heroes consulted

269
00:25:00,227 --> 00:25:05,209
with Black Panther, who sent them some vibranium
knuckle guards that Mr. Fantastic used to defeat

270
00:25:05,249 --> 00:25:09,891
the villain. As it turned out, vibranium was
one of Ulysses' only weaknesses due to its

271
00:25:09,931 --> 00:25:15,134
vibration absorbing properties that would render
his powers inert. Ulysses was imprisoned, but

272
00:25:15,174 --> 00:25:20,136
was freed by Ultron, who recruited him into
his Masters of Evil super villain team. The

273
00:25:20,176 --> 00:25:25,218
group took on the Avengers, but were defeated
in battle with Ulysses falling to his rival,

274
00:25:25,438 --> 00:25:30,741
the Black Panther. His sound form was too powerful
to be subdued by conventional means, however,

275
00:25:31,201 --> 00:25:36,867
and Ulysses to set his sights on an isotope
variation of Wakandan vibranium called Antarctic

276
00:25:36,907 --> 00:25:41,789
Vibranium, which was found only in the Savage
Land, a hidden tropical region in Antarctica

277
00:25:41,949 --> 00:25:47,911
located well below sea level. Unlike Wakandan
vibranium which absorbs vibrations, Antarctic

278
00:25:47,931 --> 00:25:53,913
vibranium emanates vibrations. Ulysses was thwarted
in his attempt to obtain it by the jungle hero

279
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:59,367
of the Savage Land known as Khazar. who caused
the villain to attune the Antarctic Vibranium

280
00:25:59,508 --> 00:26:04,511
at such a frequency as to open a portal to a
different vibratory plane of reality, where

281
00:26:04,571 --> 00:26:09,495
Ulysses became stuck. Eventually, though, he
found his way back home via the Nexus of All

282
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:14,378
Realities, a portal to all dimensions that you
can learn more about in our Swamp Thing vs

283
00:26:14,458 --> 00:26:19,341
Man Thing dual episode. Ulysses suffered his
quickest and most embarrassing defeat at the

284
00:26:19,381 --> 00:26:25,534
hands of the mutant Dazzler, whose whole ability
is to convert sound into light energy. She

285
00:26:25,574 --> 00:26:31,196
absorbed his sound essence only to expel it
later in a fight with Galactus, the world devourer.

286
00:26:31,677 --> 00:26:36,519
Ulysses' consciousness then found itself living
inside of Galactus' machinery for a time until

287
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:41,321
he was discovered by Dr. Doom during the Secret
Wars event where heroes were pit against villains

288
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:46,684
in a cosmic experiment on a planet called Battleworld.
After returning to Earth, Ulysses became a

289
00:26:46,724 --> 00:26:51,711
member of the Frightful Four, alongside the
Wizard, Hydro Man and Titania, and the team

290
00:26:51,731 --> 00:26:56,455
was successful in transforming the Fantastic
Four's thing from his rocky form into his human

291
00:26:56,495 --> 00:27:02,140
form as Ben Grimm, thus rendering the hero powerless.
Though the Frightful Four were able to capture

292
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:06,984
the remaining Fantastic Four, it was the human
Ben Grimm who freed his teammates and saved

293
00:27:07,024 --> 00:27:12,329
the day, resulting in Ulysses being imprisoned
by Mr. Fantastic in a special vacuum containment

294
00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:19,038
unit. An echo construct of Ulysses himself managed
to evade apprehension, however. and captured

295
00:27:19,098 --> 00:27:25,142
the hero Daredevil in an effort to use his superior
senses to locate his original self via a specially

296
00:27:25,202 --> 00:27:30,206
built antenna. Daredevil destroyed the Echo's
antenna device though, which destroyed the

297
00:27:30,286 --> 00:27:35,389
Echo itself. The real Ulysses would be freed
by the frightful Four, which included the new

298
00:27:35,409 --> 00:27:40,573
member Carnage, whom you can learn more about
in our Lobo vs Carnage dual episode. Due to

299
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:46,657
the symbiote's insanity and weakness to Sonics,
Ulysses kept Carnage in check to keep the team

300
00:27:46,717 --> 00:27:52,137
safe. Carnage turned on the team, however, and
stabbed Ulysses with a vibranium spear that

301
00:27:52,177 --> 00:27:58,463
caused him to detonate and disperse beyond reconstitution.
With his final act, Ulysses used the last of

302
00:27:58,503 --> 00:28:03,847
his power to summon a bolt of sound energy that
separated Carnage from his host. Though he

303
00:28:03,867 --> 00:28:08,631
was believed to be dead, Ulysses was later found
as a prisoner of the international peacekeeping

304
00:28:08,711 --> 00:28:14,556
agency, SHIELD, apparently having reconstituted.
That's his backstory. Powers-wise, Claws abilities

305
00:28:14,636 --> 00:28:20,621
stem from his Soundwave body. which his consciousness
can vibrate at a frequency to produce a solid

306
00:28:20,681 --> 00:28:26,165
form. In fact, he can manipulate all ambient
sound in his vicinity for a variety of effects,

307
00:28:26,586 --> 00:28:33,031
including creating other solid sound constructs
called echoes, project waves or beams of concussive

308
00:28:33,071 --> 00:28:38,996
force, and create deafening or debilitating
tones. By manipulating the frequency of his

309
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:44,101
own sonic state, he can render himself highly
durable, with increased strength able to lift

310
00:28:44,141 --> 00:28:49,115
around 10 tons, and even more when supported
by additional vibrational force, or he can

311
00:28:49,135 --> 00:28:53,856
render himself intangible. Either way, he is
virtually immortal and resistant to physical

312
00:28:53,896 --> 00:28:58,998
attack. He is a gifted technical engineer and
scientist in the branch of physics that studies

313
00:28:59,058 --> 00:29:04,980
sound. His only weakness is vibranium, which
absorbs sound, or a vacuum in which he would

314
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:10,414
dissipate. And that's Klaue. I'm not gonna lie,
Klaue is a pretty cool villain. Yeah, he's

315
00:29:10,454 --> 00:29:15,238
kind of like a red lantern, although more like
a red green lantern because red lanterns do

316
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:19,601
they even produce constructs? I thought it was
just like lava. They can, they can. Although

317
00:29:19,621 --> 00:29:25,826
I do think it's dumb that his friggin weakness
is the primary weapon of his rival. That's

318
00:29:25,866 --> 00:29:30,830
like Superman going up against kryptonite man.
Yeah, Clair really needs to find a better enemy

319
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:36,295
than the guy who is best equipped to kill him.
Exactly. I think you'd be a much more successful

320
00:29:36,355 --> 00:29:41,474
villain if he stopped going against the Black
Panther. Definitely not the Dazzler either.

321
00:29:41,955 --> 00:29:42,477
That was funny.

322
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:53,051
Now that we got the characters' histories and
abilities out of the way, let's speculate on

323
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:57,712
how one of the 1000 simulated matches will go.
The winner is determined by his simulations,

324
00:29:58,032 --> 00:30:02,893
not the speculation, but it's fun to imagine
how the fight can play out. AJ9K, what are

325
00:30:02,913 --> 00:30:08,015
the rules of our speculation? Well, I should
say there are no rules, other than the characters

326
00:30:08,055 --> 00:30:12,576
have no prior knowledge of the other going into
the fight. All they are aware of starting out

327
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:17,177
is that the other character is a threat that
needs to be eliminated. For the speculation...

328
00:30:17,526 --> 00:30:22,527
The contestants will begin approximately 50
meters apart in a nondescript environment that

329
00:30:22,547 --> 00:30:26,948
will have no bearing on the match itself, as
no environmental statistics are considered

330
00:30:26,968 --> 00:30:31,990
in my simulations. The contestants must earn
victory on their own merit. Alright then, let's

331
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:39,152
get into it. Livewire and Claw meet on the battlefield.
Who goes first? I'm gonna say Livewire goes

332
00:30:39,192 --> 00:30:45,062
first because electricity moves faster than
sound, I'm pretty sure. Yeah. So... She's gonna

333
00:30:45,102 --> 00:30:51,945
start by firing a lightning bolt right at Claw's
face, which no way he's fast enough to dodge

334
00:30:51,985 --> 00:30:57,547
that. Uh, well, I mean, like, if she moves her
hand and fires the lightning bolt with lightning

335
00:30:57,587 --> 00:31:02,289
speed, you're probably right. Uh, he wouldn't
be able to dodge it, so he gets hit in the

336
00:31:02,329 --> 00:31:09,052
face, but you forget his physical form isn't
normal. It's just vibrational forces that are

337
00:31:09,192 --> 00:31:13,773
rendered solid. So, like, he probably gets blasted
onto his back, and he's probably a little stunned.

338
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:20,532
but he's not like seriously injured, right?
And you know what follows lightning? That's

339
00:31:20,612 --> 00:31:27,415
right, thunder. And as soon as the thunder clap
follows her lightning bolt, which is like immediately,

340
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:35,218
the thunder is gonna empower claw and he's gonna
convert the sound of the thunder into a construct

341
00:31:35,298 --> 00:31:39,780
of like a herd of giant stampeding elephants.
And those elephants are just gonna trample

342
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:47,181
Livewire. Interesting, okay. But actually, Livewire,
she's just gonna convert her body into electricity

343
00:31:47,701 --> 00:31:53,646
and zip between the elephants and then like
zap herself right into Claw's sonic device

344
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:58,950
that he has on his hand. And she's going to
short that sucker. So now Claw can't use it

345
00:31:58,991 --> 00:32:04,895
to project sound anymore. Oh, really? Yeah.
You think it would be that easy? That's cute.

346
00:32:05,396 --> 00:32:13,350
Again, Claw is made of essentially kinetic sound
energy, including his sonic blaster. It's not

347
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:18,896
actually technology. Well, why the fuck does
it look like it is then? Like, why would he

348
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:24,541
just give himself a normal hand? Excuse me.
Something as bad as does it need a reason?

349
00:32:25,002 --> 00:32:30,187
Yes. The answer is no. You know, he has a hand
blaster on his hand because it's just that

350
00:32:30,207 --> 00:32:37,974
much cooler when he kills you with it. That's
why. Oh, my gosh. OK. So live wire. She dives

351
00:32:38,034 --> 00:32:44,039
into his sonic blaster hand, which is essentially
just pure kinetic energy. So she gets thrown

352
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:49,623
out of it, I guess. But now she knows what she's
dealing with, at least more or less. And she's

353
00:32:49,643 --> 00:32:57,628
going to generate an electromagnetic energy
dome around Klaut to contain him. Okay. Well,

354
00:32:57,648 --> 00:33:03,733
I'm going to say this electricity dome is probably
making a noise, like this low level electric

355
00:33:03,893 --> 00:33:10,217
hum sound, right? So Klaue's gonna tap into
that electrical hum and amplify it so that

356
00:33:10,257 --> 00:33:16,882
it turns into this debilitating, piercing noise
that just penetrates the energy field and hurts

357
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:23,747
Livewire's ears so bad that she like drops the
energy field. And then Klaue is gonna shoot

358
00:33:23,787 --> 00:33:29,671
this massive, concussive energy beam from a
sonic blaster at Livewire and it's gonna slam

359
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:35,114
into her like a freight train and cause her
body to disperse. I was going to call bullshit

360
00:33:35,234 --> 00:33:41,136
on that, like, piercing sound attack you just
did, but I guess she is still able to hear

361
00:33:41,276 --> 00:33:48,059
things. Yeah, yeah. I guess it would work. OK,
so you fired this beam at her and say her body

362
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:55,582
was dispersed. You think it was a dispersal,
but it was intentional to dodge the beam and

363
00:33:55,622 --> 00:34:00,624
livewire reforms, like essentially teleporting
right behind Klawe, where she's going to grab

364
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:07,388
him by the back of the neck and just electrocute
him. at the source fatality style dude sonic

365
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:12,892
form I don't know what you don't get about that
yes solid sonic form it would have no effect

366
00:34:12,932 --> 00:34:19,577
on him like the sound does not conduct electricity
so she's gonna try to electrocute him he just

367
00:34:19,617 --> 00:34:25,321
goes intangible to escape her grasp and then
he's gonna shoot a massive shock wave into

368
00:34:25,341 --> 00:34:31,445
the ground beneath live wire like shaking the
ground and breaking it up and he's gonna lift

369
00:34:31,505 --> 00:34:37,250
these massive boulders using vibrational forces
into the air and then slam them down onto her

370
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:42,694
just Burying live wire like deep into the ground
like 20 or 30 feet in the ground He buries

371
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:48,619
live wire and that grounds her right? I'm no
scientist But I think at that point her electrical

372
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:53,483
energy form would be grounded and would like
disperse into the earth and she would lose

373
00:34:53,523 --> 00:35:00,369
Her form so she'd be gone Essentially so match
over you just got scienced. Oh, too can sense

374
00:35:00,429 --> 00:35:09,054
of this game bitch Let's say when she's grabbing
him by the neck, that electric charge was actually

375
00:35:09,094 --> 00:35:16,598
to convert his sound form into an electric current,
just like a microphone, so that she could transmit

376
00:35:16,638 --> 00:35:23,161
his body into space as radio waves. So she wins.
What is that? How microphones work? You don't

377
00:35:23,181 --> 00:35:28,704
know how microphones work. Yeah, man. They like
use magnets or some shit to like turn sound

378
00:35:28,784 --> 00:35:36,013
into an electric signal and live It's like a
living electromagnet. So in your face. Magnets,

379
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:44,400
how do they work? Ha ha ha. But like, you need
some kind of like antenna or something to broadcast

380
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,924
the signal. Like she would need some kind of
technology. She can't do that on her own. No,

381
00:35:48,984 --> 00:35:53,788
actually, she can. That's one of her abilities
that I said she had. She's actually even done

382
00:35:53,828 --> 00:35:59,152
her own Sonic attacks before by bombarding people
who could hear radio waves like Superman or

383
00:35:59,172 --> 00:36:04,768
the Flash's children. Oh. Well, good on you
for conveniently leaving that out of your bio.

384
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:10,831
I just said I mentioned it. I wasn't paying
attention to you. Also, radio waves are not

385
00:36:10,871 --> 00:36:15,114
the same thing as actual sound. So I think you're
full of crap. That's not technically a sonic

386
00:36:15,154 --> 00:36:19,536
attack. I don't know what you're talking about.
No, but a microphone will convert sound into

387
00:36:19,776 --> 00:36:24,900
a radio wave. And again, she just blasts them
out into space to drift forever. That's stupid.

388
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:30,411
But we could leave the match there. I say she
gets buried underground. and you say that Klaue

389
00:36:30,431 --> 00:36:35,634
gets blasted into the sky as radio waves. Yeah,
no sound in space. Yeah, in space, no one can

390
00:36:35,654 --> 00:36:39,197
hear Klaue scream. We'll go ahead and leave
the match there. We'll run the stats on these

391
00:36:39,217 --> 00:36:44,301
characters and find out which of these scenarios
happens when we come back with a winner. AG9K,

392
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:51,706
hit it. Inputting data, running calculations,
processing results, simulations complete. All

393
00:36:51,726 --> 00:36:56,569
right. I was really nervous prior to the match,
trying to figure out how these two energy beings

394
00:36:56,609 --> 00:37:01,583
would hurt each other, live wire being electrical
energy, claw being essentially kinetic energy.

395
00:37:01,823 --> 00:37:05,884
I don't know if we found a great solution. We
had to get really sciencey at the end there

396
00:37:05,904 --> 00:37:10,865
with our speculation. And probably 99% of that
is bullshit because you and I are not scientists

397
00:37:10,885 --> 00:37:16,507
and we have no idea what the hell we're talking
about. But it was a speculation. Yeah, yeah,

398
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:22,809
it was. Technically, when it came to figuring
out their stats, for the most part, they were

399
00:37:22,829 --> 00:37:29,113
going pretty tit for tat, I would say. Like
Livewire is definitely faster than Claw. Yeah,

400
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:34,859
but Claw is stronger and smarter. We said they
were about the same when it came to evasiveness

401
00:37:34,979 --> 00:37:39,703
considering they both can go intangible, although
have a kind of semi-tangible form that allows

402
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:45,529
them to get punched in the face by the good
guys. They're both really destructive. Their

403
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:51,082
damage potential is really high. They're also
both really versatile characters. Yeah, given

404
00:37:51,142 --> 00:37:55,905
that they could use their powers for a variety
of effects, like Livewire even has Technopathy

405
00:37:56,486 --> 00:38:01,189
and Klaue can create constructs, including duplicates
of himself and stuff like that. So a lot of

406
00:38:01,209 --> 00:38:06,052
back and forth, but also a lot of like equity
between their abilities. For the most part,

407
00:38:06,072 --> 00:38:12,857
there was fighting skill. We said that while
Klaue was an experienced fighter, Livewire

408
00:38:13,338 --> 00:38:18,281
basically had no training whatsoever. And there
was nothing in my research to indicate that

409
00:38:18,321 --> 00:38:24,450
she did. She's very much a projectile based
attacker. Very rarely does it come down to

410
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:29,574
fisticuffs. So basically taking all of these
stats into account, Joseph, who do you think

411
00:38:29,594 --> 00:38:35,659
came out on top? I think Mr. Ulysses Kla is
coming out on top of this one. Although no

412
00:38:35,699 --> 00:38:41,123
one on Instagram agrees with me. Well, actually
I should say 72% of the people who took our

413
00:38:41,163 --> 00:38:45,867
poll don't agree with me, but it's fine to be
wrong. They can be wrong. I'm actually a little

414
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:51,447
bit surprised that LiveWire came out that high.
I think just. Maybe a lot of people are thinking

415
00:38:51,487 --> 00:38:56,391
about the MCU version of Klaue and thinking
that there's no way that he would be able to

416
00:38:56,411 --> 00:39:00,715
defeat someone made out of lightning. That's
my guess. That's probably a really good guess.

417
00:39:00,835 --> 00:39:08,181
Well, let's find out who won. AJ9K, the results
please. Hey, Yuasa. The winner of the matchup

418
00:39:08,581 --> 00:39:22,364
between Livewire and Klaue is... fucking Klaue.
Yeah! And it wasn't even Um, he won 693 of

419
00:39:22,404 --> 00:39:31,511
the 1000 matches or 69.3% compared to Livewire
winning only 30.7. Okay, so Claude wins around

420
00:39:31,551 --> 00:39:36,855
two-thirds of the time. And honestly, like this
baffles the shit out of me. Like I know the

421
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:43,880
discrepancy in the fighting stat is pretty drastic,
but damn, I thought I totally had you when

422
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,871
it came to like our speculation. and I came
out of that really confident that Livewire

423
00:39:48,891 --> 00:39:54,334
would win, but apparently not. Well, it's hard
to think of an instance in which this fight

424
00:39:54,414 --> 00:39:59,117
would come down to hand-to-hand combat, right?
Right, exactly. But you would have to assume

425
00:39:59,137 --> 00:40:03,699
that fighting skill would play at least a small
portion of some of the matches, and when you

426
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:08,682
run a thousand simulations, it was enough of
an influence to give Claude the ultimate victory.

427
00:40:09,162 --> 00:40:15,085
It also just baffles me that sound can beat
lightning energy. That's... I cannot comprehend

428
00:40:15,105 --> 00:40:20,393
that. but it's also hard to comprehend lightning
energy beating sound too, right? No, not for

429
00:40:20,433 --> 00:40:24,697
me. I totally see it. But that does it for this
duel. Let us know what you guys thought about
