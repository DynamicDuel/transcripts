00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:29,924
And welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:35,988
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:36,528 --> 00:00:41,171
I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm his twin brother,
Johnny DC. Happy Halloween, everybody! This

5
00:00:41,231 --> 00:00:45,513
episode is the big event that Jonathan and I
have been talking about all Halloween season.

6
00:00:45,794 --> 00:00:51,117
We are surprising you guys with a team duel.
That's right. Normally we only do team duels

7
00:00:51,177 --> 00:00:56,887
every 25 episodes. But we're squeezing in one
for this Halloween holiday because we think

8
00:00:56,907 --> 00:01:04,170
it's just gonna be that awesome. That's right,
we're pitting Deceased against Marvel zombies.

9
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:15,215
Spooky. Both DC and Marvel have had critically
acclaimed and fan-loved zombie story arcs and

10
00:01:15,295 --> 00:01:20,317
it's gonna be a whole lot of fun pitting these
DC zombie characters against these Marvel zombie

11
00:01:20,337 --> 00:01:24,812
characters. We're gonna put their stats into
our simulation runner and find out which group

12
00:01:24,832 --> 00:01:28,254
would actually come out on top later on this
episode. Before that, we're gonna break down

13
00:01:28,274 --> 00:01:32,036
the comic book and movie news to come out this
past week, of which there was only one news

14
00:01:32,116 --> 00:01:37,079
item worth discussing, that is that Daredevil
Born Again has gotten a show runner, Dario

15
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,861
Skardapane, who was a writer on The Punisher.
So that's pretty exciting. We'll talk about

16
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:46,264
that coming up, but as always, we list our segment
times in our episode description, so feel free

17
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:50,535
to check out the show notes if you wanna skip
ahead to a particular topic. As our listeners

18
00:01:50,575 --> 00:01:55,541
may know, our duel simulator is so advanced
that it's gained sentience and has named itself

19
00:01:55,601 --> 00:02:00,808
the Artificial Lightform for running extensive
duels, just a rather very intelligent simulator

20
00:02:00,968 --> 00:02:10,002
9000, or Alfred Jarvis 9000. He has a quick
message for our listeners, so listen up. Why

But with that out of the way, quick to the

41
00:03:59,446 --> 00:04:06,218
no prize. A no prize is an award that Marvel
used to give out to fans. Our version, the

42
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:11,260
Dynamic Dual Node Prize, is a digital award
that we post on Instagram and in our email

43
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,802
newsletter for the person that we feel gave
the best answer to our question of the week.

44
00:04:16,342 --> 00:04:21,004
Last week we asked, which Marvel or DC character
do you think would make for the most awesome

45
00:04:21,204 --> 00:04:26,066
anime series and why? And this was coming off
of the interview we did with Zach from Send

46
00:04:26,086 --> 00:04:30,448
Your World, which is in the Dynamike network.
We got a lot of great answers here. There were

47
00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:34,309
no bad answers for this, but let's go ahead
and break down our three honorable mentions.

48
00:04:34,698 --> 00:04:40,783
as well as the no prize winner. Our first honorable
mention goes to, Miggy Mathengian who said,

49
00:04:41,243 --> 00:04:46,048
Hey what's up guys this is Miggy and I think
Monkey Prince would make the most awesome anime

50
00:04:46,088 --> 00:04:54,175
series. I'm taking CJ Craft's answer, he answered
a couple weeks ago for what animated series

51
00:04:54,235 --> 00:04:58,679
or animated movie would you want to see and
he answered Monkey Prince. I think he would

52
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:03,330
make a good anime. So yeah keep up the good
work guys. Yeah, I loved this answer right

53
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:08,752
away when I heard it. My mind went to Hit Monkey,
which was a fantastic anime series. And I would

54
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:12,913
love to see something like that in the vein
for Monkey Prince. Just super stylized, super

55
00:05:12,953 --> 00:05:17,254
fun. It would be awesome. Yeah, we recently
had a duel episode with Monkey Prince where

56
00:05:17,294 --> 00:05:21,875
we pit him against Mantis from the Guardians
of the Galaxy. That was a really fun episode.

57
00:05:22,475 --> 00:05:25,936
And it was really cool to learn about Monkey
Prince and his pretty interesting backstory

58
00:05:26,096 --> 00:05:31,739
steeped in Chinese mythology. Great answer,
Biggie. And also. to CJ, because Biggie stole

59
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:39,125
the answer from you. Our next honorable mention
goes to Travis Herndon, who said, Hey guys,

60
00:05:39,186 --> 00:05:44,711
Travis here. So my pick would have to be Lobo.
I feel like you could easily make a cool Lobo

61
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:50,336
anime, have the same blood and gore as Castlevania,
with the same comedy as the Harley Quinn show.

62
00:05:50,856 --> 00:05:55,861
And I believe it's time for the main man to
get an anime series. So my pick would definitely

63
00:05:55,881 --> 00:06:02,718
be Lobo. Yeah, there aren't many genres that
do violence as well as anime does. It's just

64
00:06:02,798 --> 00:06:09,362
so over the top with gushing torrents of blood
and gore. And Lobo as a character was designed

65
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:15,267
for exactly that. Yeah, I mean, you couldn't
probably do a character like Lobo justice in

66
00:06:15,287 --> 00:06:21,031
a different animated genre, right? Like I couldn't
see a great Lobo series done like Adventure

67
00:06:21,071 --> 00:06:26,034
Time or something like that. It has to be anime.
I think it'd be awesome. The character of Lobo

68
00:06:26,054 --> 00:06:30,438
himself is so stylized and so is the art form.
So, yeah, I think they suit each other really

69
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:35,282
well. Well, I mean, Lobo has done pretty well
in like the Bruce Tim Superman animated series

70
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:40,366
and some other animated movies that we've had,
like Man of Tomorrow, but it's also a very

71
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:45,410
tamed down version of the character. And if
you want to stay true to him, yeah, you definitely

72
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:50,194
got to make it anime or it should be anime.
Great answer, Travis. Our next honorable mention

73
00:06:50,214 --> 00:06:57,135
goes to Abner O'Terry, who said, Hey, guys,
this is Abner O'Terry. Coming into the best

74
00:06:57,235 --> 00:07:08,424
answer for this question. Mine is Blue Beetle.
Like his, the whole situation with his scarab

75
00:07:08,564 --> 00:07:16,350
is just like perfect for the anime world. Yeah,
of course. We recently gave an answer of Blue

76
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:22,030
Beetle as the no prize win for which character
would be best in a video game. But I equally

77
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:27,595
think that Blue Beetle would be great in an
anime series as well. Just with how cool and

78
00:07:27,635 --> 00:07:33,380
kinetic and action-packed the character is with
his technological components, it would be so

79
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,904
cool just to see him go super Saiyan. Yeah,
it would fit squarely within the shounen genre,

80
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:43,749
where basically the character Blue Beetle would
discover a new power as he becomes more acquainted

81
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:48,112
with the abilities of the Scarab throughout
each episode and he'd kind of grow in might

82
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:52,696
as the series progressed. Yeah, just like my
adventures with Superman. You know, Blue Beetle

83
00:07:52,716 --> 00:07:57,500
would be perfect in that genre of anime as well.
Honestly, the only reason this answer didn't

84
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,265
get the no prize win was because we had just
given the win to a Blue Beetle answer a couple

85
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:07,969
of weeks ago. Yeah. Great answer, Abner. We
want to give a quick shout out to Christopher

86
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:13,273
Minotti, Brandon Estregard and Mitchell Smoothie
for taking the time to visit our website and

87
00:08:13,313 --> 00:08:19,322
record an answer. Yeah, those are also great
answers, including Mr. Mixus Biddlek. Vixen

88
00:08:19,602 --> 00:08:26,266
and Mr. Negative. But the winner of this week's
snow prize is Nate Mantineo who said, Hey guys,

89
00:08:26,466 --> 00:08:33,410
Nate Mantineo. Um, I'm going with the obvious
answer on your question tonight. Um, I think

90
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:39,713
that Penny Parker would make an awesome anime
because she is anime and we've always seen

91
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:47,854
her. She's been anime and I love anime and her
with S P I D R would be awesome and I just

92
00:08:47,914 --> 00:08:51,277
want to see that because I love superheroes
and I love anime and mix them together and

93
00:08:51,357 --> 00:08:57,182
I just love it. Bye guys. Thanks. Yeah, Penny
Parker is a fantastic answer. Of course, she's

94
00:08:57,202 --> 00:09:01,606
a Japanese character most recently seen on the
screen in the Into the Spider-Verse movie.

95
00:09:01,827 --> 00:09:06,511
I think she'd be fantastic. Yeah, it'd be great
to have a series with her following her adventures

96
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:11,855
with the spider robot and her spider pal. But
I would also like to maybe extend this answer

97
00:09:11,895 --> 00:09:16,838
to include all of the Spider-verse. An anthology
series where she basically travels Spider-verse

98
00:09:16,858 --> 00:09:21,921
and meets different Spider-men would also be
cool because honestly I think any Spider-man

99
00:09:22,081 --> 00:09:27,525
would be awesome as an anime. Yeah, it could
sort of be like an Isekai adventure. That genre

100
00:09:27,565 --> 00:09:32,548
of anime where the main character travels to
a new land and just experiences that learns

101
00:09:32,688 --> 00:09:38,270
all about that. Exactly. That's a fantastic
answer. I'm honestly disappointed that Sony

102
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,772
doesn't already have something like that in
the works. Considering the success of the Spider-Verse

103
00:09:43,012 --> 00:09:46,913
animated films, you'd think they'd want to spin
off something to keep that franchise going.

104
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:51,314
Yeah, maybe after the third film in the trilogy
is done, they could continue to explore those

105
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:56,195
worlds with something like a Penny Parker anime.
That would be amazing. I do have to say though,

106
00:09:56,235 --> 00:10:02,977
as great as this answer was, no one said the
most perfect answer, which is Amethyst from

107
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:08,919
DC Comics. She's a character who realized that
in another world, she's actually a magical

108
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:14,082
princess. And that would be absolutely perfect
for not only like a magical girl anime, but

109
00:10:14,142 --> 00:10:19,064
also like I mentioned, an isekai. Actually,
that's interesting because my wife, I told

110
00:10:19,084 --> 00:10:24,666
her to call in with an answer, but she didn't.
But she suggested that a great Marvel anime

111
00:10:24,766 --> 00:10:30,588
would be the Scarlet Witch, kind of in the vein
of WandaVision meets Paprika. I don't know

112
00:10:30,608 --> 00:10:35,414
if you saw that anime movie, which is about
dreaming. So it would just be really mind-warpy

113
00:10:35,474 --> 00:10:39,816
and reality-bending. I thought that was a great
answer too. So shout out to Ari, even though

114
00:10:40,096 --> 00:10:44,838
you didn't call in. But congrats to Nate for
winning this week's No Prize. If you, the listener,

115
00:10:45,138 --> 00:10:48,719
want a shot at winning your own No Prize, stay
tuned to later on this episode when we'll be

116
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:53,421
asking another Question of the Week. And now
that that's done, on to the news.

117
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:04,283
Marvel Studios has taken their Daredevil Born
Again series back to square one and are creatively

118
00:11:04,343 --> 00:11:10,545
rebooting the series. They previously let go
of writers Chris Ord and Matt Corman because

119
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:15,727
they want to take the series in a different
direction. They decided that their previous

120
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:20,948
system of making Disney Plus series the same
exact way they make their movies no longer

121
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:24,969
works for television and so they're going to
take a more classic television production.

122
00:11:25,522 --> 00:11:30,123
route with their television show making process.
And that'll include, you know, writing a show

123
00:11:30,143 --> 00:11:36,044
bible, hiring a show runner, and in some cases
even producing pilots. This past week we learned

124
00:11:36,124 --> 00:11:41,906
that the Daredevil Born Again series has already
landed its show runner. So Marvel has really

125
00:11:41,946 --> 00:11:46,387
wasted no time, which is fantastic, but the
show runner is going to be Dario Scartapane,

126
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:52,849
who has worked on not only shows like Tom Clancy's
Jack Ryan, but also previously he's done Marvel

127
00:11:54,958 --> 00:12:00,959
for Netflix. Which was awesome. I loved that
series. Yeah, it was a great show. It really

128
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:05,841
seems like Marvel's trying to kind of stick
to the tone that was previously established

129
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:10,782
by the Netflix series with the Daredevil born
again show. So I think that's fantastic news.

130
00:12:11,322 --> 00:12:15,483
Yeah, honestly, it's like the best news I've
heard for this series. I was really worried

131
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:20,164
that Disney was gonna screw up a Daredevil television
series, but this is the best thing they could

132
00:12:20,204 --> 00:12:25,334
have done to make it just like what we got before
with Netflix. Right, well, I mean, because

133
00:12:25,354 --> 00:12:28,877
they weren't going to make it better, right?
You know, Disney Plus was not going to do a

134
00:12:28,897 --> 00:12:32,820
better job than Netflix with the Daredevil show
because the Daredevil show was near perfection.

135
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,682
So you're right. The best thing they could do
is continue that series forward, at least tonally,

136
00:12:37,063 --> 00:12:42,767
if not in continuity. In addition to the showrunners,
Marvel has also hired a couple of directors,

137
00:12:42,927 --> 00:12:48,471
Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead, who are co-directors
that have also done Marvel television, including

138
00:12:48,931 --> 00:12:54,848
episodes of Loki season two and Moon Knight.
They were actually the lead directors on Loki

139
00:12:54,868 --> 00:13:00,433
season 2. Right. And both of the shows, Loki
and Moon Knight, are incredibly cinematic.

140
00:13:00,834 --> 00:13:07,220
So I would like to see them carry forward that
very grand feel to a Daredevil show and make

141
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,284
it really feel like a movie of sorts. I think
that'd be fantastic. Absolutely. This is all

142
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:15,428
great news. I was like shitting my pants a few
weeks ago when I saw that Marvel was rebooting

143
00:13:15,468 --> 00:13:19,847
their series, but it really seems... Like they're
making a lot of really great decisions, not

144
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:23,949
just in the talent that they're hiring, but
in their approach in general. So I think the

145
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:28,171
Daredevil show will be all the better for it.
And I'm really looking forward to it, even

146
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:32,133
though we don't know when we're going to get
it, probably sometime in 2025 or something.

147
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:38,397
But speaking of Marvel television and the former
Netflix television shows, that brings us to

148
00:13:38,417 --> 00:13:39,397
our question of the week.

149
00:13:43,862 --> 00:13:50,067
What was your favorite Netflix Marvel television
series and why? Of course that includes Daredevil,

156
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:28,235
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's get into the main event

157
00:14:28,756 --> 00:14:36,027
where we find out who would win in our spooky
zombie apocalypse matchup of Deceased versus

158
00:14:36,548 --> 00:14:37,369
Marvel Zombies.

159
00:14:52,534 --> 00:14:56,956
Welcome to the zombie apocalypse, y'all. That's
right, it's an all out gorefest as we find

160
00:14:57,016 --> 00:15:01,698
out who'd win between the deceased and the Marvel
zombies. Both of these series came out within

161
00:15:01,738 --> 00:15:08,361
the past 15 years or so. Jeez, actually I think
Marvel zombies came out in the mid 2000s. It

162
00:15:08,381 --> 00:15:12,924
was a comic book series written by Robert Kirkman
around the same time that he was writing The

163
00:15:12,944 --> 00:15:19,143
Walking Dead. It's a fantastic, shocking, depressing.
comic book series that was adapted recently

164
00:15:19,263 --> 00:15:26,288
to animation in the Marvel Zombies episode of
What If, which was a fantastic episode. Definitely

165
00:15:26,308 --> 00:15:31,832
a departure from the comic book series in the
story it told, but no less gruesome and kind

166
00:15:31,852 --> 00:15:37,076
of freaky and scary and kind of fucked up too.
Yeah, I mean, Deceased has not been adapted

167
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:41,999
to any kind of animation style, but it was critically
acclaimed. Actually, the series just wrapped

168
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:48,247
up earlier this year in April in 2023. It was
written by acclaimed comic writer, Tom Taylor,

169
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:53,171
who is popular for also doing the Injustice
comic book storyline. That really expanded

170
00:15:53,211 --> 00:15:56,973
the story of the video game. That's pretty cool,
I didn't know that. We're really excited to

171
00:15:56,993 --> 00:16:01,536
bring this Team Duel episode to you guys on
Halloween day. We knew from the get-go, once

172
00:16:01,576 --> 00:16:05,799
we saw that this episode was dropping on Halloween,
that we had to make it special. Yeah, it's

173
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:09,581
not too often you get to see zombies fighting
zombies, so I think this will be a lot of fun.

174
00:16:10,058 --> 00:16:14,480
Right, right. Yeah, actually, initially, this
was going to be just a standard 1v1 duel, but

175
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:18,402
once we read the comics, we knew that we had
to cram as many zombies as we could within

176
00:16:18,442 --> 00:16:23,125
this battle. Yeah, I actually had a really hard
time narrowing down my seven character roster.

177
00:16:23,245 --> 00:16:27,227
Kudos to the executive producers who really
helped out with that. Running team duels is

178
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:32,190
a lot more difficult than running 1v1 duels,
but to explain the methodology behind our duels,

179
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:38,373
let's go to our sentient duel simulator, Alfred
Jarvis 9000. AJ9k, tell our listeners how you

180
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:44,136
go about determining a winner in these team
duel matchups. Yes, of course, sir. The way

181
00:16:44,216 --> 00:16:49,018
I determine a winner between the two teams is
by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations between

182
00:16:49,118 --> 00:16:54,280
every character on each team using their statistics.
A Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic

183
00:16:54,320 --> 00:17:00,142
model used to determine outcomes through random
sampling. In this case, I randomize the statistics

184
00:17:00,182 --> 00:17:05,024
along a normal distribution as a way to simulate
the many variables that can occur during battle.

185
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:10,046
The stat parameters are based on the official
Marvel power grid. from which the DC characters'

186
00:17:10,086 --> 00:17:15,268
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat
categories are included such as range, damage

187
00:17:15,288 --> 00:17:20,829
potential, versatility and perception in order
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.

188
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:26,031
The results of the 49,000 simulations provide
a percentage of wins for each character on

189
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:30,653
both teams. The team with the higher average
win rate is declared the victor as they have

190
00:17:30,673 --> 00:17:35,475
a higher probability to win any given battle.
In an equitable pairing, neither team should

191
00:17:35,495 --> 00:17:40,319
win 100% of the matches. The comic book stories
have shown that there's even a way for Batman

192
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:44,723
to defeat Superman, so the confidence rate of
my method falls in line with the precedents

193
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:49,867
that have been established in the source material.
My mathematical simulations are without subjectivity

194
00:17:49,907 --> 00:17:55,371
or bias. Feats are not the sole consideration,
nor are fan votes tabulated for determination

195
00:17:55,411 --> 00:18:00,916
of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K. Before we run the
simulations, though, we like to break down

196
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:06,654
the histories and rosters for each team. before
improvising a scenario on how we imagine one

197
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:12,396
of the many simulations would play out B for
B. And I believe it's my turn to go first with

198
00:18:12,436 --> 00:18:18,458
the DC backstory, so let me tell you all about
the storyline of Deceased. Spoiler alert if

199
00:18:18,498 --> 00:18:23,579
you haven't finished the series. After a massive
victory by the Justice League over Darkseid's

200
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:28,901
attempted invasion of Earth, the tyrannical
Darkseid retreated to his distant planet of

201
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:35,840
Apocalypse, just as Earth's heroes realized...
that Cyborg was missing. Darkseid had captured

202
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:41,764
Cyborg during his invasion and tortured him
on Apocalypse, believing his body, half human,

203
00:18:42,024 --> 00:18:47,828
half New God technology, was encoded with the
final remnant of the Anti-Life Equation that

204
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:53,753
Darkseid needed to control every living being
in the universe. In order to keep Cyborg alive

205
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:59,557
long enough to extract the Equation, Darkseid
summoned the New God embodiment of Death, the

206
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:06,205
Black Racer. and unknowingly merged some of
Death's essence with Cyborg, just as the equation

207
00:19:06,225 --> 00:19:12,109
was fully deciphered. Darkseid, infected by
the techno-organic virus that was now the Corrupted

208
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:17,853
Equation, was consumed by madness and killed
the Black Racer, just as Darkseid's chief scientist,

209
00:19:17,953 --> 00:19:23,777
Desaad, boomtubed Cyborg back to Earth in an
effort to send the equation from Apocalypse.

210
00:19:24,257 --> 00:19:29,541
But it was too late. Darkseid leapt into the
fires of Apocalypse and unleashed his full

211
00:19:29,621 --> 00:19:35,752
Omega power. annihilating the planet. Once Cyborg
arrived back on Earth, his systems reconnected

212
00:19:35,772 --> 00:19:41,174
to the internet wirelessly, and he accidentally
uploaded the anti-life equation to the internet.

213
00:19:41,554 --> 00:19:47,456
The virus spread quickly, as anyone who viewed
a screen was exposed to the equation and driven

214
00:19:47,516 --> 00:19:52,739
mad with the need to kill any unaffected living
being in their vicinity, with them also being

215
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:57,480
capable of spreading the virus by blood contact.
Though Superman was able to realize what was

216
00:19:57,521 --> 00:20:03,640
happening fast enough to save his wife and Lois
Lane and Jonathan Kent, Batman was unable to

217
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:09,924
save Nightwing and Red Robin, who attacked and
transmuted the virus to him, forcing Alfred

218
00:20:10,264 --> 00:20:16,488
to kill all three. Batman's son Damien, who
was with Jonathan when the virus struck, survived,

219
00:20:16,928 --> 00:20:22,112
as did Green Arrow and Black Canary, the latter
of whom became a Green Lantern after she was

220
00:20:22,152 --> 00:20:27,435
forced to kill an infected Hell Jordan. The
surviving heroes assembled at the Daily Planet

221
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:32,358
in Metropolis, as instructed by Lois Lane in
a message she managed to broadcast from the

222
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:38,561
Daily Planet. Metropolis was soon destroyed,
however, after an infected atom breached Captain

223
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:43,744
Adam's metallic shell, infecting Kim as well
and causing Kim to detonate his atomically

224
00:20:43,804 --> 00:20:50,408
energized body in an explosion that destroyed
Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and Metropolis.

225
00:20:50,928 --> 00:20:56,623
The heroes at the Daily Planet and Lex Luthor
were the only survivors of the explosion, thanks

226
00:20:56,663 --> 00:21:01,625
to Black Canary protecting them with her Green
Lantern Ring. When Earth's remaining uninfected

227
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:07,187
population being sheltered on the Paradise Island
of Themyscira and a dense forest in Gotham

228
00:21:07,227 --> 00:21:12,790
City created by Poison Ivy, Earth's surviving
heroes assembled at the Fortress of Solitude,

229
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,731
away from the infected, where Cyborg and Lex

230
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:26,505
When Mr. Terrific failed to develop a cure,
he learned from the new gods Mr. Miracle and

231
00:21:26,545 --> 00:21:32,690
Big Barda that the source, Apocalypse, had been
destroyed. They attempted to recruit John Constantine

232
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:38,434
to provide a magical solution, to which Constantine
revealed that one did not exist. Planning on

233
00:21:38,494 --> 00:21:43,458
using Booster Gold's time machine as a last
resort, Big Barda became infected and killed

234
00:21:43,498 --> 00:21:49,662
Mr. Terrific and Blue Beetle, though Constantine
was rescued by Dr. Fate and Zatanna. The remaining

235
00:21:49,702 --> 00:21:54,965
members of the Justice League attempted to persuade
Black Adam to turn his nation of Condoc into

236
00:21:54,985 --> 00:22:01,248
a third refuge as he had killed all anti-living
within his borders. But Black Adam refused

237
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:06,892
and became infected not long after, turning
his entire nation into an anti-living army

238
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:12,495
soon after. Wonder Woman managed to stop Black
Adam, however, by using her lasso to force

239
00:22:12,515 --> 00:22:18,030
him to say Shazam and lose his power, after
which Superman used his heat vision. to sever

240
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:23,334
Adam's vocal cords and prevent him from gaining
power again. As the heroes neared completion

241
00:22:23,374 --> 00:22:28,918
of the arcs at the Fortress of Solitude, they
were attacked mentally by an infected, invisible

242
00:22:29,058 --> 00:22:35,042
Martian Manhunter, who managed to also infect
the Flash before Firestorm set Martian Manhunter

243
00:22:35,102 --> 00:22:41,086
on fire. The Flash, infecting surviving humans
across the planet at light speed, was stopped

244
00:22:41,146 --> 00:22:47,082
by Superman, who collided with him. Only for
the Flash's fingers. to get lodged in Superman's

245
00:22:47,142 --> 00:22:52,643
torso during the incident, infecting Superman,
who attempted to flee the planet unsuccessfully

246
00:22:52,924 --> 00:22:58,105
before he succumbed to the virus. As the heroes
acted quickly to get the Arks to Themyscira

247
00:22:58,165 --> 00:23:04,067
and Gotham, Wonder Woman forged a sword from
Kryptonite and magic in order to fend off Superman

248
00:23:04,127 --> 00:23:10,369
and protect the Arks. She failed, however, and
was infected by Superman, who went after the

249
00:23:10,409 --> 00:23:15,875
now fully boarded Arks as they escaped Earth's
gravity. While Cyborg stayed behind with Wonder

250
00:23:15,915 --> 00:23:21,179
Woman, Black Canary went after Superman with
the Kryptonite Sword, just as the entirety

251
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:26,562
of the Green Lantern Corps arrived to quarantine
the planet. As the Arks successfully escaped,

252
00:23:27,043 --> 00:23:32,787
Superman retreated into the sun for protection.
Meanwhile, Cyborg bound Wonder Woman with her

253
00:23:32,827 --> 00:23:39,171
magic lasso as she transformed into the Anti-Living,
at which point she confessed to him that his

254
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:44,562
code had possessed a cure for the virus all
along. But before Cyborg could send a signal

255
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:50,605
to the Arks to inform them, Woodroman escaped
the lasso and tore off his head. The Arks eventually

256
00:23:50,685 --> 00:23:56,667
settled on a planet they dubbed Earth-2, and
after five years, Jonathan, Damien, and other

257
00:23:56,687 --> 00:24:00,789
heroes returned to Earth to check on it, at
which point they received a distress beacon

258
00:24:01,109 --> 00:24:06,951
coming from Cyborg's head. After rescuing Cyborg,
Mr. Miracle and a group of heroes took him

259
00:24:06,971 --> 00:24:12,686
to the new god Metron, and Cyborg was able to
use Metron's all-knowing Mobius Chair. to learn

260
00:24:12,706 --> 00:24:19,288
how to code a cure for the virus, while Constantine
and other magic users defended Earth from Trigon,

261
00:24:19,408 --> 00:24:23,710
who attempted to destroy the planet to prevent
the virus from spreading across the cosmos.

262
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:30,273
After curing everyone on Earth and Superman,
Brainiac arrived at Earth too and warned them

263
00:24:30,353 --> 00:24:36,416
that the infected new gods were tearing across
the universe. Darkseid, they learned, survived

264
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:42,959
the destruction of Apocalypse and infected everyone
on New Genesis. After decapitating Sinestro,

265
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:49,424
Darkseid took control of his Yellow Ring, becoming
a Yellow Lantern Zombie and infecting the planet-sized

266
00:24:49,484 --> 00:24:56,250
weapon and Yellow Lantern homebase of Warworld
with the Anti-Life Virus. As planets fell to

267
00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:02,135
Darkseid and his anti-living army, the God of
War Ares manipulated the Owens to order the

268
00:25:02,175 --> 00:25:07,099
Green Lantern Corps to attack all other heroes
under the belief that it was less of a risk

269
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:12,762
to kill the infected rather than try to cure
them. After Mix's Spitalik became infected

270
00:25:13,082 --> 00:25:17,784
and destroyed the Green Lantern Core's central
power battery, the Spectre sacrificed himself

271
00:25:17,804 --> 00:25:23,367
to repair the battery and defeat Mix's Spitalik.
As Darkseid and his army arrived at Earth-2,

272
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:29,729
Elfrid transformed into the New Spectre in order
to save Damian, who had become infected by

273
00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:36,532
Highfather of New Genesis. The Spectre was able
to cure all infected beings on Earth-2, including

274
00:25:36,632 --> 00:25:43,791
Darkseid, with the help of Lobo. It was revealed
that the anti-life equation was created by

275
00:25:43,831 --> 00:25:49,654
the primordial god of darkness, Erebus, and
that he would need to be defeated in order

276
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:55,896
to save the universe. Damien, as it turned out,
found the counter-life equation within Cyborg's

277
00:25:55,936 --> 00:26:02,139
code, and with help from Darkseid, the heroes
were able to use a Doom Tube to teleport outside

278
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:08,454
the universe to Erebus' domain, where Damien
sacrificed himself while inside Erebus. to

279
00:26:08,474 --> 00:26:14,775
destroy him and create an entirely new universe.
And that's the story of Deceased. Now, the

280
00:26:14,815 --> 00:26:20,397
real stars of Deceased aren't the Anti-Living,
but since this is a zombie match, my roster

281
00:26:20,417 --> 00:26:25,238
for the team duel match is going to consist
of some of the most prominent and devastating

282
00:26:25,318 --> 00:26:31,560
members of the Anti-Living, primarily from the
original 6 issue run and the spinoff stories

283
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:37,381
that occurred concurrently. Superman, of course,
was a massive and powerful threat to the arcs.

284
00:26:37,698 --> 00:26:41,999
that contained the last of humanity, so he's
definitely one of my team members, though he

285
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:47,580
has a prosthetic metal right arm after losing
it to Wonder Woman's kryptonite sword. Speaking

286
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:53,182
of Wonder Woman, she's also a member of my roster
as she, along with Superman, was among the

287
00:26:53,202 --> 00:26:58,343
most powerful infected heroes at the end of
the initial story. And yes, she's wielding

288
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:04,125
her kryptonite sword. I'm also going with Black
Adam, who led an anti-living army against the

289
00:27:04,185 --> 00:27:11,400
world, and who destroyed three major US cities
in one massive explosion. In that same vein,

290
00:27:11,861 --> 00:27:17,724
I'm also going with Martian Manhunter, Big Barda,
and The Flash, who killed or infected major

291
00:27:17,764 --> 00:27:24,528
characters within the story. So my roster consists
of Superman, Wonder Woman, Black Adam, Captain

292
00:27:24,628 --> 00:27:29,951
Adam, Martian Manhunter, Big Barda, and The
Flash, all of whom you can learn about in their

293
00:27:29,991 --> 00:27:36,514
respective dual episodes. Regarding zombies
in Deceased, they aren't technically zombies

294
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:40,855
because they aren't dead. You know, they just
become extremely violent with the urge to kill

295
00:27:41,235 --> 00:27:47,137
all other living beings. They can be killed
by any standard means that the character would

296
00:27:47,237 --> 00:27:52,478
normally be killed by, but they also retain
any powers and durability that they had when

297
00:27:52,498 --> 00:27:58,060
they were among the living, and none of the
infected can feel pain. They all also share

298
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:05,482
a hive mind controlled by Erebus that can sense
nearby living entities. And finally, the antilife

299
00:28:05,502 --> 00:28:12,884
virus that infects them can also infect technology
as it is techno-organic. That is quite the

300
00:28:12,964 --> 00:28:17,465
powerful team that you have there. Hell yeah
it is, but it's not going to be powerful enough

301
00:28:17,765 --> 00:28:22,907
against the Marvel zombies who have literally
eaten the universe. Let me go ahead and tell

302
00:28:22,927 --> 00:28:28,488
you all about them. It all started with a flash
in the sky and a ripple through the clouds.

303
00:28:29,088 --> 00:28:34,330
A being infected with a terrible plague known
only as the hunger. fell onto the streets of

304
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:40,291
Manhattan. The disease spread like wildfire,
infecting and transforming anyone bitten. The

305
00:28:40,331 --> 00:28:45,933
Avengers of this reality were the first on the
scene, including Colonel America, Hawkeye,

306
00:28:46,113 --> 00:28:51,375
Scarlet Witch, Black Widow, Luke Cage, and the
Wasp. But they were quickly overwhelmed. The

307
00:28:51,395 --> 00:28:57,316
hunger was too powerful and the Avengers too
few. One by one, they fell to the disease.

308
00:28:57,856 --> 00:29:03,466
Colonel America was the first bitten by a zombie
and turned into one himself. He then bit Spider-Man,

309
00:29:03,547 --> 00:29:08,791
who had arrived on the scene to help. In the
confusion, Spider-Man returned home, only to

310
00:29:08,851 --> 00:29:14,315
turn and devour his wife, Mary Jane, and his
Aunt May. Ant-Man knew he was running out of

311
00:29:14,355 --> 00:29:18,919
time. The virus was spreading through his body,
and he could feel the hunger taking over his

312
00:29:18,979 --> 00:29:24,564
mind. He had to find a way to survive, even
if it meant sacrificing someone else. He lured

313
00:29:24,584 --> 00:29:29,868
Black Panther to his hidden lab, knocked him
out, and surgically removed pieces of him to

314
00:29:29,908 --> 00:29:35,801
serve as a snack for later. From his Asteroid
M orbital space station observation deck, Magneto

315
00:29:35,861 --> 00:29:40,885
watched in horror as the population consumed
itself. He knew that this was just the beginning

316
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:45,408
and traveled to Earth to warn the X-Men what
was happening. He led them to join the fight

317
00:29:45,468 --> 00:29:50,552
in Manhattan, where the Fantastic Four were
already battling the zombies after losing Franklin

318
00:29:50,652 --> 00:29:55,196
and Valeria to the zombie She-Hulk. The remaining
heroes gathered together at the S.H.I.E.L.D.

319
00:29:55,556 --> 00:30:00,976
helicarrier, their last hope. Director Nick
Fury ordered them to split up to bring as many

320
00:30:01,016 --> 00:30:06,500
survivors as possible to the SHIELD base, while
Reed Richards, Tony Stark, and Bruce Banner

321
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:11,603
worked on a zombie cure. Tony suggested the
scientists work individually to approach the

322
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:17,467
cure from multiple angles, though secretly he
suspected that humanity was doomed and instead

323
00:30:17,587 --> 00:30:23,671
built a dimensional portal device. Reed was
driven insane by the loss of his children and

324
00:30:23,711 --> 00:30:28,335
came to admire the efficiency of the zombie
organism. He claimed it was the next stage

325
00:30:28,355 --> 00:30:34,079
of human evolution and infected the other Fantastic
Four members and had them feed on him to turn

326
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:39,123
him into a zombie as well. Damn. They ravaged
the helicarrier and turned the other heroes

327
00:30:39,163 --> 00:30:45,408
inside into zombies, including Hulk, Thor, Doctor
Strange, and Storm. Meanwhile, virtually every

328
00:30:45,448 --> 00:30:49,932
other hero began to fall to the plague during
their rescue missions, including the X-Men

329
00:30:50,152 --> 00:30:56,597
and Wolverine. Within 24 hours, nearly the whole
of Earth's population was a zombie or dead.

330
00:30:57,058 --> 00:31:01,941
The remaining zombified heroes reflected on
the monsters they had become and the atrocities

331
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:07,085
they had committed, having eaten their friends,
families, and those they were supposed to protect.

332
00:31:07,625 --> 00:31:12,389
At that time, the Silver Surfer flew over the
planet as a herald of the forthcoming Galactus

333
00:31:12,849 --> 00:31:17,173
and the heroes saw their chance at their next
meal. While contemplating how to get at the

334
00:31:17,213 --> 00:31:22,957
Surfer, the Wasp found Ant-Man's secret Black
Panther stash and he bit off her head to keep

335
00:31:23,017 --> 00:31:27,975
it quiet. When the Silver Surfer landed to announce
Galactus' imminent arrival, the group of zombie

336
00:31:27,995 --> 00:31:34,096
heroes attacked and consumed the Herald, acquiring
a portion of the Power Cosmic. These zombies,

337
00:31:34,316 --> 00:31:42,259
including Hulk, Colonel America, Wolverine,
Luke Cage, Spider-Man, Iron Man, and Ant-Man,

338
00:31:42,739 --> 00:31:47,480
then fried the remaining zombie heroes with
their cosmic energy to see if cooking their

339
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:53,041
zombie flesh made them edible. It didn't, and
the Power Cosmic zombies found themselves again.

340
00:31:53,366 --> 00:31:59,150
without a food source. That is, until Galactus
himself arrived. Knowing there were no match

341
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:04,495
for the Devourer of Worlds, the Power Cosmic
Zombies retreated to find a way to eat Galactus.

342
00:32:05,035 --> 00:32:11,160
Meanwhile, Black Panther escaped Ant-Man's confinements
with help from the Wasp's severed head. Together,

343
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:16,484
the two found their way to Asteroid M, where
Magneto's acolytes still survived, and they

344
00:32:16,504 --> 00:32:21,348
found there the Mutant Forge, who was able to
fashion new artificial limbs for Black Panther.

345
00:32:23,074 --> 00:32:28,615
The zombified Ant-Man, Iron Man, and Bruce Banner
developed an amplifier device that would increase

346
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:33,877
the output of power cosmic energy directed into
it. With the device, the zombies were able

347
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:39,198
to injure Galactus enough to topple him, though
an army of villain zombies tried to fight them

348
00:32:39,238 --> 00:32:44,019
for Galactus' flesh. Although Colonel America
fell in the battle when the Red Skull pulled

349
00:32:44,059 --> 00:32:48,461
his brain out through an opening in his skull,
the other heroes were able to destroy the villains

350
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:54,399
and they feasted on Galactus as a reward. Now
known as the Zombie Galacti, they left the

351
00:32:54,439 --> 00:33:00,503
planet and journeyed across the universe, devouring
every single life form. Meanwhile, on Earth,

352
00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:06,007
the Kingpin used the Jackal's cloning tools
to set up an economic system among the remaining

353
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:11,371
villain zombies where they did his bidding for
the opportunity to feed on the clones. In an

354
00:33:11,431 --> 00:33:16,635
effort to increase their food supply by invading
other dimensions, Morbius and Deadpool travel

355
00:33:16,655 --> 00:33:20,897
to the mainstream Marvel dimension through the
nexus of all realities in the Florida Swamp.

356
00:33:21,282 --> 00:33:26,125
Though Deadpool was reduced to just a head,
Morbius was able to disguise himself as his

357
00:33:26,185 --> 00:33:31,169
mainstream counterpart and pretended to work
on a cure, but secretly planning to infect

358
00:33:31,309 --> 00:33:36,713
all the heroes. Fortunately, Machine Man was
able to save the mainstream Morbius, who in

359
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:42,777
turn recruited a new iteration of the Midnight
Suns to combat and contain the virus. Decades

360
00:33:42,817 --> 00:33:48,021
later, back in the zombie reality, the zombie
Galacti returned to Earth after eating the

361
00:33:48,121 --> 00:33:53,823
universe. Looking to use Tony Stark's dimensional
portal device to invade other realities, they

362
00:33:53,863 --> 00:33:59,706
discovered that Black Panther, Forge, and the
Acolytes had rebuilt a small society of survivors

363
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:05,608
on Earth called New Wakanda. But more than that,
they saw that the severed heads of the Wasp

364
00:34:05,748 --> 00:34:11,011
and Hawkeye, after spending all this time not
feeding on human flesh, had overcome their

365
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:17,213
hunger. Shocked, Spider-Man and Luke Cage turned
on the other zombie galacti and joined New

366
00:34:17,233 --> 00:34:24,176
Wakanda. which protected itself with an impenetrable
force field. Hungry, the remaining zombie galacti

367
00:34:24,256 --> 00:34:28,978
left New Wakanda and traveled to the Baxter
Building to try and find the dimensional portal

368
00:34:29,098 --> 00:34:34,060
before realizing it had been in New Wakanda
this whole time. The New Wakandans prepared

369
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,943
for the zombies' return and for battle, revealing
that Colonel America's brain had been rescued

370
00:34:39,123 --> 00:34:44,465
and preserved in a new body. Though New Wakanda
was unable to stop the zombie galacti from

371
00:34:44,525 --> 00:34:49,596
getting through the force field, the zombies
realized that they too had overcome their hunger

372
00:34:49,937 --> 00:34:56,082
just prior to feasting. All the zombies that
is, except for the Hulk, who in a rampage killed

373
00:34:56,142 --> 00:35:01,906
Hawkeye, Iron Man, and several Wakandan citizens
before reverting to Bruce Banner and begging

374
00:35:01,946 --> 00:35:08,752
to be killed. The remaining zombies, Wolverine,
Colonel America, Spider-Man, Luke Cage, Black

375
00:35:08,772 --> 00:35:14,577
Panther, Ant-Man and the Wasp, helped rebuild
New Wakanda. And though the crisis appeared

376
00:35:14,617 --> 00:35:19,853
to be at an end, the zombies were ultimately
betrayed by the New Akandans who didn't trust

377
00:35:19,873 --> 00:35:24,797
the hunger to never return, and they were sent
to another dimension using the Portal Device.

378
00:35:25,398 --> 00:35:30,101
Scattered across a new universe and stripped
of the power of cosmic, some zombies reverted

379
00:35:30,122 --> 00:35:35,066
to their old ways such as Ant-Man, while others,
like Spider-Man, tried to stop the disease

380
00:35:35,086 --> 00:35:40,470
from spreading once again. Ultimately, all it
took was Ant-Man biting the Hulk, who in turn

381
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:46,335
bit the Sentry, for this new dimension to fall
like the last. the three largest alien races

382
00:35:46,475 --> 00:35:52,819
in the universe. The Skrulls, Kree, and Shi'ar,
led by Black Panther, the Wasp, and Luke Cage,

383
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:58,343
respectively, couldn't stop the disease. During
a final stand between the good and bad zombies,

384
00:35:58,864 --> 00:36:03,707
the Sentry was captured in the blue area of
the moon, where Ant-Man tried to use him as

385
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:09,872
an energy source to power the Watcher's dimensional
portal. There, Spider-Man unleashed a chemical

386
00:36:09,912 --> 00:36:15,426
weapon he had created against the zombies, using
his old foe the Sandman to spread and destroy

387
00:36:15,626 --> 00:36:21,028
every last member of the undead remaining. With
only the trapped Sentry left standing, the

388
00:36:21,068 --> 00:36:26,970
cosmic being known as the Watcher teleported
him back in time to another dimension, creating

389
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:32,651
a time loop between two realities, where the
zombie virus would remain confined. The Sentry

390
00:36:33,172 --> 00:36:38,673
landed in this new dimension above Manhattan,
arriving with a flash in the sky and a ripple

391
00:36:38,693 --> 00:36:43,695
through the clouds. And that's the Marvel Zombies
backstory for this team duel, going with the

392
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:48,896
zombie Galacti, the group of zombies that devoured
the Silver Surfer and Galactus, imbuing them

393
00:36:48,936 --> 00:36:56,278
with the power cosmic. This includes Spider-Man,
Wolverine, Hulk, Colonel America, Iron Man,

394
00:36:56,558 --> 00:37:01,219
and Luke Cage. In addition to their regular
powers, all of which you can learn more about

395
00:37:01,259 --> 00:37:07,201
in their respective duel episodes, each of these
zombies can fly at orbital speeds, fire devastating

396
00:37:07,301 --> 00:37:13,144
power cosmic energy blasts, rearrange matter,
and have a minor level of awareness at a cosmic

397
00:37:13,184 --> 00:37:17,987
level which helped them locate life forms to
consume. As zombies, they are tremendously

398
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:22,731
difficult to kill, and can only die if their
brain is completely destroyed. The zombies'

399
00:37:22,771 --> 00:37:27,874
teeth can apparently get through anything, as
even people as durable as Luke Cage, the Silver

400
00:37:27,934 --> 00:37:32,877
Surfer, and even Galactus were able to be bitten.
Although they normally retain their intelligence,

401
00:37:33,238 --> 00:37:38,221
the zombies start to lose rationality as they
get hungrier and their minds become more obsessed

402
00:37:38,241 --> 00:37:43,217
with eating. The hunger for living flesh itself
is entirely mental, as even severed zombie

403
00:37:43,257 --> 00:37:49,282
heads hungered. Though after weeks without food,
the hunger would eventually dissipate. So again,

404
00:37:49,322 --> 00:37:55,947
my roster is Spider-Man, Wolverine, Hulk, Colonel
America, Iron Man, and Luke Cage. So I am confused.

405
00:37:55,987 --> 00:38:01,412
What was the origin of the zombie virus? There
was no origin. It's like a time paradox, basically.

406
00:38:01,752 --> 00:38:07,577
The being that caused the virus in the first
place was the sentry who was sent back in time

407
00:38:08,418 --> 00:38:13,840
the Watcher after the zombie virus had already
spread to that new universe. So it has no beginning

408
00:38:13,941 --> 00:38:21,985
and no end really. That's dumb. The Marvel Zombies
story was eventually rebooted within the last

409
00:38:22,025 --> 00:38:26,027
few years, I think it was called Marvel Zombies
Resurrection. And they kind of reimagined the

410
00:38:26,067 --> 00:38:33,131
story as a virus sourced from diseased Galactus.
Okay, but the Robert Kirkman story is the classic,

411
00:38:33,231 --> 00:38:38,082
you know, that's the one that everybody knows
and it's a fantastically dark story. Yeah,

412
00:38:38,102 --> 00:38:43,224
I mean, it's freaking Robert Kirkman. I do love
the fact that the title of it is Marvel Zombies,

413
00:38:43,285 --> 00:38:49,068
which is a moniker bestowed upon anyone who
reads only Marvel comics because they're just

414
00:38:49,108 --> 00:38:54,010
so ridiculously devoted to the company and will
only read that, even though there's better

415
00:38:54,051 --> 00:38:59,173
shit out there from DC no less. Well, it doesn't
surprise me that there are people who only

416
00:38:59,213 --> 00:39:03,516
read Marvel because it's just better. There's
no such term as a DC zombie because no one

417
00:39:03,556 --> 00:39:09,500
out there reads just DC because it's not good
enough. I mean. I only read DC. You DC zombie.

418
00:39:16,742 --> 00:39:22,045
Alright, now that we've got the storylines and
the rosters out of the way, let's speculate

419
00:39:22,205 --> 00:39:28,068
on how one of these simulated matches will go.
The winning team is determined by simulations,

420
00:39:28,508 --> 00:39:33,651
not this speculation, but it's fun to imagine
how the fight could play out. Alfred Jarvis9000,

421
00:39:34,431 --> 00:39:39,935
what are the rules of our speculation? Well,
I should say there are no rules, other than

422
00:39:39,975 --> 00:39:44,297
the teams have no prior knowledge of the other
going into the fight. All they are aware of

423
00:39:44,357 --> 00:39:48,823
starting out... is that the other side is a
threat that needs to be eliminated. For the

424
00:39:48,843 --> 00:39:53,984
speculation, the groups will begin approximately
50 meters apart in a nondescript environment

425
00:39:54,204 --> 00:39:58,765
that will have no bearing on the match itself,
as no environmental statistics are considered

426
00:39:58,785 --> 00:40:03,547
in my simulations. The teams must earn victory
on their own merit. Alright then let's get

427
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:09,388
into it. Deceased and the Marvel zombies meet
on the battlefield, who goes first? All I know

428
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:14,702
is that first off, if the deceased are actually
technically still alive, then that means they

429
00:40:14,722 --> 00:40:20,827
are food for the Marvel zombies. And that is
gonna get the Marvel zombies like really excited.

430
00:40:20,887 --> 00:40:26,811
It's gonna send them to a ravenous glee. Okay,
fine. That's fine. I'm gonna say the deceased

431
00:40:26,831 --> 00:40:33,056
go first though, because we have a speedster
on our team, the Flash. And he's just gonna

432
00:40:33,256 --> 00:40:38,340
start off by running right up to the Hulk, since
you know, he's a big burly guy, and he's gonna

433
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:43,647
phase his arm right into the Hulk's torso. just
making a giant hole and spilling the Hulk's

434
00:40:43,747 --> 00:40:48,969
guts out. Well, fortunately for the Hulk, he
doesn't need guts to function. So he's gonna

435
00:40:49,049 --> 00:40:54,431
react to the Flash's attack by grabbing the
speedster's arm. And then when the Flash tries

436
00:40:54,451 --> 00:40:58,973
to run away, he doesn't run away with the arm
because Zombie Hulk just ripped that thing

437
00:40:59,133 --> 00:41:08,857
off and then he eats it. Okay. I mean, the Flash
is off using his speed force to heal his stump

438
00:41:09,017 --> 00:41:15,541
arm now. And... The two teams are just gonna
clash and Black Adam, he's gonna start by sending

439
00:41:15,741 --> 00:41:22,166
a lightning bolt at let's say Wolverine because
you know he's a conductor with his metal skeleton.

440
00:41:23,487 --> 00:41:27,649
And that lightning is just gonna sizzle Wolverine
to a burnt crisp. Again that's not gonna do

441
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:31,892
anything. Wolverine is just gonna smile, this
charred smile. Actually, Marvel zombies are

442
00:41:31,912 --> 00:41:37,536
probably always smiling because they don't have
any lips, you know. But uh meanwhile Ant-Man

443
00:41:37,556 --> 00:41:43,196
is gonna grow into Giant-Man. and he's going
to stomp onto Martian Manhunter, pinning him

444
00:41:43,216 --> 00:41:48,960
to the floor so he can grab him underneath his
boot and then just devour him. Martian Manhunter,

445
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,083
he would just phase through the floor and just
like leave Giant Man to wonder what the heck

446
00:41:53,103 --> 00:41:59,908
just happened. Meanwhile, Wonder Woman, she's
going to run through Spider-Man with her sword,

447
00:42:00,048 --> 00:42:04,251
just impaling him at the torso. And then, you
know, she's going to pull out the sword and

448
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:10,075
slice him again, this time just hacking him
from shoulder to navel. Damn! That's pretty

449
00:42:10,115 --> 00:42:18,240
violent. Fucking zombies. Iron Man sees this
and he's gonna shoot a cosmic unibeam from

450
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:24,484
his armor and that's just gonna blast Wonder
Woman away from Spider-Man who is gonna patch

451
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:31,409
his split in half upper body together with webbing.
That's crazy. Yeah, it's like super glue. Okay,

452
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:36,873
meanwhile Superman and Hulk are gonna be going
to blows with, you know, Hulk probably trying

453
00:42:36,913 --> 00:42:42,864
to eat Superman. But Superman, he's going to
keep him at bay by freezing the Hulk's lower

454
00:42:42,904 --> 00:42:48,067
body with his freeze breath. And then he's just
going to punch the Hulk's lower body right

455
00:42:48,167 --> 00:42:53,249
off. So now the Hulk has no legs because they're
just shattered. That's not like the big move

456
00:42:53,269 --> 00:43:00,453
that you think it is. OK, but meanwhile, Luke
Cage, he's going to pick up Wolverine and fastball

457
00:43:00,493 --> 00:43:09,114
special him, hurling him at Big Barda. And Wolverine
flies into Big Barda claws first. tackling

458
00:43:09,134 --> 00:43:12,856
her to the ground, pinning her to the floor
with his claws, and then he's gonna rip her

459
00:43:12,876 --> 00:43:18,280
throat out with his teeth like a hungry wolf.
Except that before Wolverine gets one bite

460
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:25,105
in, he's gonna get blasted off of Big Barda
by Captain Adam, who's then gonna fire another

461
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:31,109
quantum blast at Colonel America that takes
the top part of his skull right off, just exposing

462
00:43:31,149 --> 00:43:35,351
his brain. Well, it probably only took off the
top part of his head because Colonel America

463
00:43:35,392 --> 00:43:41,928
was raising his shield up to his head. Um, so
the Colonel actually redirects a large part

464
00:43:41,968 --> 00:43:47,653
of Captain Adam's blast, reflecting the energy
beam right into Black Adam blasting him. Okay.

465
00:43:47,773 --> 00:43:53,798
I say that the deflected beam also severs one
of Giant Man's legs because, you know, Colonel

466
00:43:53,818 --> 00:44:01,664
America wasn't really aiming that well and Giant
Man was such a massive target. Now, Big Barda,

467
00:44:01,744 --> 00:44:06,848
she's going to leap up Giant Man's severed leg
hole and she's going to explode out of his

468
00:44:06,928 --> 00:44:13,440
chest with her Mega Rod. Jeez! How does that
work? She leaps up his leg hole and explodes

469
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:20,183
at his chest? Yeah, she goes right into his
mushy zombie body. Oh jeez. Okay, well at this

470
00:44:20,223 --> 00:44:27,546
point, we'll say Superman is trying to use his
heat vision to decapitate Luke Cage. But, you

471
00:44:27,566 --> 00:44:33,589
know, Luke Cage isn't fazed because he has unbreakable
skin. So Luke yanks Superman's cape and slams

472
00:44:33,629 --> 00:44:38,859
him down to the ground and uh... With Superman
pinned, Luke quickly shoves his thumbs into

473
00:44:38,939 --> 00:44:45,044
Superman's eyes, just frying them out of his
skull with his power cosmic. So Superman has

474
00:44:45,104 --> 00:44:51,668
no eyes. He's blind and unable to stop Luke
Cage from biting him. Dang! I mean, Superman

475
00:44:51,708 --> 00:44:58,353
has other enhanced senses, so blindness wouldn't
phase him too much. Although I guess like he

476
00:44:58,373 --> 00:45:03,537
can't use his heat vision or x-ray vision or
telescopic vision or anything like that anymore.

477
00:45:03,977 --> 00:45:10,186
Exactly. But uh... Martian Manhunter, he's going
to stop Luke Cage from biting Superman by transforming

478
00:45:10,246 --> 00:45:15,470
into this like zombie demon monster with two
heads and like a giant mouth where his stomach

479
00:45:15,570 --> 00:45:23,617
is and he's going to just straight up swallow
Luke Cage whole. Okay, but at that time Spider-Man

480
00:45:24,378 --> 00:45:28,681
is going to fly over to Big Barda and she's
probably going to try to blast him with her

481
00:45:28,721 --> 00:45:33,854
mega rod, but he's going to use his Spidey sense
to dodge and then get him behind her. close

482
00:45:33,874 --> 00:45:39,035
enough to grab her back and then bite her in
the shoulder. So now Barda is going to become

483
00:45:39,115 --> 00:45:45,237
a zombie and is now part of team Marvel. Okay,
I saw something like this coming and I have

484
00:45:45,257 --> 00:45:51,418
a theory Marvel zombies. They retain their intelligence,
right? They're just like overwhelmed with hunger,

485
00:45:51,898 --> 00:45:57,600
but the anti-living have a hive mind. They're
controlled by Erebus outside of the universe.

486
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,961
So it's not like their mind would be affected
by the hunger and turning one of the DC guys

487
00:46:03,402 --> 00:46:09,365
doesn't make them Team Marvel because technically,
Erebus still knows that he needs to bring down

488
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:15,688
the Marvel zombies. So basically all you've
done is give Barda added defense because now

489
00:46:15,708 --> 00:46:21,952
she won't die if she like gets cut in half or
whatever. No, no, no. The hunger overcomes

490
00:46:22,012 --> 00:46:26,654
everything. Like Barda would be consumed by
it. She would want to feast on whatever flesh

491
00:46:26,694 --> 00:46:33,198
is nearby and the only flesh that's around is
that of her DC teammates. Yeah, I mean, she'll

492
00:46:33,218 --> 00:46:39,681
want to feast, but she won't because Erebus
is in control. And he's an elder deity, way

493
00:46:39,701 --> 00:46:45,705
more powerful than this hunger. Well, maybe
Erebus's mind succumbs to the hunger when she's

494
00:46:45,745 --> 00:46:52,188
bitten. Probably not, unless the Marvel zombie
virus can be spread mentally, like telepathically.

495
00:46:52,208 --> 00:46:57,751
No, it only spreads physically, but the Marvel
zombies aren't going to stop trying to feed

496
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:02,950
on the DCs just because the DC guys aren't joining
their side, but- If they bite them, then that

497
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:08,535
means all they're doing is just making the DC
guys more unkillable. Right. But I guess not

498
00:47:08,595 --> 00:47:13,419
totally unkillable because the Marvel zombies
do know about the brain weakness, whereas the

499
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:20,685
DC guys wouldn't. That's true. That's true.
OK, so we'll say that, yes, the Marvel guys

500
00:47:20,725 --> 00:47:27,131
can turn DC guys into zombies, but it's not
going to turn the DC guys onto Team Marvel.

501
00:47:27,491 --> 00:47:32,586
Exactly. It's not going to make them feed on
their teammates. So we'll say that Bart is

502
00:47:32,626 --> 00:47:38,829
a zombie now. And the first thing she's gonna
do is she's gonna leap onto Iron Man, who's

503
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:44,991
flying around and she's gonna drive her mega
rod right into his chest reactor and upload

504
00:47:45,071 --> 00:47:51,914
the anti-light virus into his armor. And since
this is a techno-organic virus that also infects

505
00:47:51,934 --> 00:47:58,537
technology, Erebus now has control over Iron
Man and he's going to use him to repulsor blast

506
00:47:58,557 --> 00:48:06,302
the shit out of Spider-Man. What? So I can't
make Barda team Marvel, but you can make Iron

507
00:48:06,322 --> 00:48:13,267
Man team DC. Yep. What the fuck? Technically,
it's Iron Man's armor, not Tony Stark. That's

508
00:48:13,287 --> 00:48:19,571
infected. OK, that's true. Yeah, Tony Stark
is the one who's cosmically powered, not the

509
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:25,155
armor. So realizing that he lost control of
the Iron Man armor, Tony's going to use the

510
00:48:25,196 --> 00:48:30,066
power cosmic to expel the suit from his body.
and then he's gonna destroy the armor with

511
00:48:30,106 --> 00:48:36,828
a cosmic blast. Fuck! So that's pretty easy.
And then the Hulk, he's using power cosmic

512
00:48:36,908 --> 00:48:43,310
to fly, even though he's missing his lower legs,
his lower half. He's basically just a flying

513
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:48,792
upper torso. He's gonna grab Black Adam out
of the air and take a big bite out of his leg,

514
00:48:48,832 --> 00:48:54,353
just ripping out his quad muscles with his teeth.
So now Black Adam's a zombie. And that's fine,

515
00:48:54,413 --> 00:48:59,577
like. Go ahead and make my guys more powerful.
I'm OK with that. Black Adam, you know, he's

516
00:48:59,617 --> 00:49:04,602
just going to respond to anyway by grabbing
Hulk's skull with both hands and electrocuting

517
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:09,206
it with such a strong current that it's going
to cause Hulk's brain and head to explode,

518
00:49:09,506 --> 00:49:17,593
killing him. So Zombie Hulk is dead. OK, um,
I think by this point, like, Ant-Man is going

519
00:49:17,613 --> 00:49:23,690
to be like, guys, biting these people isn't
transferring the hunger. because that's probably

520
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:28,471
what they would think, not knowing that, you
know, the other zombies are a hive mind. But

521
00:49:28,531 --> 00:49:31,312
like, I don't know if the team would actually
care. Like Wolverine is probably going to be

522
00:49:31,352 --> 00:49:38,835
like, who cares? Eat to kill, you know? So don't
just turn them, devour them. So he's going

523
00:49:38,855 --> 00:49:44,116
to fly over to Captain Adam and just plunge
his claws and teeth into him. Dude, that's

524
00:49:44,136 --> 00:49:48,534
like the dumbest thing you could have done.
Breaching Captain Adam's skin. is only going

525
00:49:48,554 --> 00:49:53,637
to make him explode. So like Wolverine, he just
gets evaporated at the atomic level, meaning

526
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:59,201
he just basically took himself out. Shit. Well,
as long as he takes Captain Adam with him,

527
00:49:59,702 --> 00:50:06,306
that's fine, I guess. Meanwhile, Luke Cage is
going to burst out of Martian Manhunter. He

528
00:50:06,346 --> 00:50:12,070
basically ate his way out of Martian Manhunter's
body, turning Martian Manhunter into a zombie.

529
00:50:12,391 --> 00:50:18,034
But also Martian Manhunter is like missing like
half of his body mass. It's all in Luke Cage's

530
00:50:18,054 --> 00:50:24,039
stomach now. I was going to argue that like
there's no way Martian Manhunter would have

531
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:30,825
felt half of his body being eaten, but I guess
you know the deceased don't feel pain. So sure,

532
00:50:31,325 --> 00:50:36,310
doesn't matter though, because Martian Manhunter
is going to psychically induce vomiting in

533
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:43,195
Luke Cage and reabsorb that mass. All right.
Meanwhile, the Flash is going to clothesline

534
00:50:43,215 --> 00:50:50,092
Tony Stark at full speed with his good arm.
and just decapitate him. Okay, Tony Stark has

535
00:50:50,112 --> 00:50:55,695
a severed head, but the severed head is still
alive. And it's gonna fly right back at the

536
00:50:55,735 --> 00:51:01,238
Flash chasing Kim and then chomping down on
his heel and ripping out the Flash's Achilles

537
00:51:01,298 --> 00:51:08,081
tendon, all sinewy, you know? So Flash can't
run anymore, he trips, he's down on the ground,

538
00:51:08,242 --> 00:51:13,524
and then Tony Stark's head is gonna chew through
Flash's face until it gets to the brains, and

539
00:51:13,544 --> 00:51:21,880
then he's just gonna suck up the brains. So
flash is out and Colonel America, he's going

540
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:27,002
to throw a power cosmically energized shield
right into Superman's face, who can't see it

541
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:33,565
coming because he's got no eyes. No, but I mean,
he has ears so he could hear the shield coming

542
00:51:34,085 --> 00:51:38,707
and he's just going to catch it with his metal
arm. And then he's just going to rip that shit

543
00:51:38,747 --> 00:51:44,566
right in half because he's fucking Superman.
What? And, you know, by smelling. Colonel America's

544
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:50,109
rotting corpse, he rushes over to him at super
speed, just jamming his fingers right into

545
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:55,733
his face and ripping it wide open, just sending
pieces of skull and brain matter all over everywhere.

546
00:51:56,213 --> 00:52:04,118
That was hardcore. Damn. All right, well, Ant-Man
saw Superman do this and he shrunk down from

547
00:52:04,198 --> 00:52:10,101
giant man size to miniature size since Superman
doesn't have microscopic vision anymore to

548
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:14,940
sense him. and Ant-Man leaps into Superman's
head through one of the exposed eye sockets,

549
00:52:15,401 --> 00:52:20,764
and then he fries Superman's brain with cosmic
energy, just causing it to melt and then leak

550
00:52:20,825 --> 00:52:25,868
out of Superman's eye holes and like ear holes
and nose, just all the holes on his face, his

551
00:52:25,908 --> 00:52:34,554
brain is just oozing out. Jeez. Okay, dang.
Meanwhile, one Roman sees Tony Stark's head

552
00:52:34,594 --> 00:52:40,114
flying around, which is like pure nightmare
fuel, by the way, and- She's going to be able

553
00:52:40,134 --> 00:52:45,179
to expertly lasso it and yank it towards her.
At which point she just thrusts her sword right

554
00:52:45,259 --> 00:52:49,763
through his skull and through his brain, just
killing him. All right. Good one. Good one.

555
00:52:50,504 --> 00:52:56,269
Meanwhile, Spider-Man, he's going to swing over
to Martian Man Hunter who, you know, reformed

556
00:52:56,309 --> 00:53:01,454
his body from Luke Cage's puke. And now it's
back into like his standard form, though, you

557
00:53:01,474 --> 00:53:06,470
know, of course, Martian Man Hunter is missing
his lips now that he's a zombie, but Spider-Man

558
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:11,974
is gonna slap his hand on top of Martian Manhunter's
head and he sticks it there and with a powerful

559
00:53:12,074 --> 00:53:18,238
yank He essentially scalps Martian Manhunter
like exposing his brain Which Spider-Man then

560
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:26,063
incinerates with a power cosmic blast so Martian
Manhunter is out and then Luke Cage and Barda

561
00:53:26,603 --> 00:53:31,927
are gonna get into like this energy blast To
go board type match with Luke Cage firing cosmic

562
00:53:31,967 --> 00:53:37,074
energy at Big Barda and Big Barda firing mega
rod energy And for a while it seems like it's

563
00:53:37,094 --> 00:53:42,818
gonna be a stalemate, but eventually Luke Cage
is gonna overpower her energy and take control

564
00:53:42,978 --> 00:53:48,941
of her mega rod telekinetically and just send
it right through her forehead and it just lodges

565
00:53:48,981 --> 00:53:55,305
there. Wait, the Pyrocosmic gives him telekinesis?
Yeah, in a sense. Like, the Cosmic energy can

566
00:53:55,405 --> 00:54:02,029
not only fire energy blasts, but it can rearrange
matter and stuff. Fuck. Okay, well, while that

567
00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:07,099
was happening... Black Adam saw what Spider-Man
did to Martian Manhunter. So, you know, while

568
00:54:07,139 --> 00:54:11,540
Spider-Man is probably dodging Black Adam's
lightning bolts with the spider sense, it's

569
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:16,801
all just a distraction for Black Adam to move
in fast enough. And you know, now that he's

570
00:54:16,821 --> 00:54:22,943
a zombie, thanks to the Hulk, Black Adam's gonna
devour Spider-Man and absorb his power cosmic.

571
00:54:23,423 --> 00:54:30,465
That's how that works, right? Uh, we'll say
no. Why? The eight silver surfer, right? And

572
00:54:30,485 --> 00:54:37,509
absorbed his power? Sure. Okay. Alright, so
Black Adam gets the power of cosmic from Spider-Man,

573
00:54:37,830 --> 00:54:42,354
but Black Adam would find eating Spider-Man
disgusting though because zombies can't really

574
00:54:42,414 --> 00:54:47,718
tolerate the flesh of other zombies. So while
Black Adam's like retching from Spidey's zombie

575
00:54:47,738 --> 00:54:54,724
flesh, Ant-Man is going to grow back into Giant-Man,
just like massive, bigger than he's ever gotten

576
00:54:55,144 --> 00:54:59,568
with help from the power of cosmic. He grows
to like the size of Galactus, you know, and

577
00:54:59,608 --> 00:55:04,758
he's going to grab Black Adam. Like he's a frickin
toothpick and just bite down on his head and

578
00:55:05,439 --> 00:55:11,200
yank it from his shoulders like a piece of taffy.
And just grind up Black Adam's brain and skull

579
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:17,722
up in his molars. You didn't even let me use
the power. I can't use Iron Man's suit. I can't

580
00:55:17,822 --> 00:55:25,404
use Black Adam's power cosmic. Come on. I guess
I just have Wonder Woman left as my last woman

581
00:55:25,444 --> 00:55:30,165
standing as it were. And at this point, you
know, she's probably going up against Luke

582
00:55:30,185 --> 00:55:36,908
Cage. Uh, now a normal sword wouldn't be able
to break Luke Cage's skin, but Wonder Woman's

583
00:55:36,948 --> 00:55:43,090
Kryptonite sword is also magically imbued, so
that Superman would be weak to it. And I'm

584
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:49,353
guessing Luke Cage also has no defense against
magic blades either. So as their trading blows,

585
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:54,255
I'm going to say that Wonder Woman managed to
slice him right in half with her sword, scalp

586
00:55:54,295 --> 00:55:59,557
to scrote, just cleaving his brain right down
the middle vertically. All right. She cuts

587
00:55:59,737 --> 00:56:05,292
Luke Cage in half. So it's down to Ant-Man and
Wonder Woman, but not just Ant-Man and Wonder

588
00:56:05,312 --> 00:56:11,335
Woman, because Ant-Man, he's gonna have a whole
ass army behind him of giant ants, you know?

589
00:56:11,355 --> 00:56:17,479
What? And these are ants that he's weaponized
by experimenting on them with the zombie virus.

590
00:56:17,939 --> 00:56:23,822
So he has this legion of like ravenous zombie
insects that he commands to just swarm over

591
00:56:23,882 --> 00:56:30,770
Wonder Woman and they tear her limb from limb
and yeah, victory for the Marvel zombies. Where

592
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:36,011
the fuck did all the insects come from? They
were shrunk down in one of his little pockets

593
00:56:36,151 --> 00:56:40,852
on his belt. Well, you know how Captain Atom
exploded earlier? Whenever that happens in

594
00:56:40,892 --> 00:56:47,474
the comics, he's just propelled into the future.
And so right after Wonder Woman is fully devoured

595
00:56:47,714 --> 00:56:52,976
by the insects, that's when Captain Atom appears.
And then he's just gonna generate a massive

596
00:56:53,036 --> 00:56:59,517
explosion that annihilates all of the insects
and Ant-Man. Boom, victory for the deceased.

597
00:57:00,326 --> 00:57:05,348
I think that's a good counter. OK, that's bullshit.
The whole time travel thing. But we can leave

598
00:57:05,388 --> 00:57:09,571
it there. So either one of two things happens
in this scenario, depending on the results.

599
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:16,574
Either Captain Adam gets blasted into the future
at the end of this match or he doesn't and

600
00:57:16,655 --> 00:57:22,158
Wonder Woman gets devoured by ants. I mean,
why wouldn't he, though, you know? All right,

601
00:57:22,178 --> 00:57:27,160
let's go ahead and put in the stats for these
teams. We're going to run 49000 simulations

602
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:32,704
in a matrix style comparison. between all the
characters and we'll be back with a winner.

603
00:57:33,264 --> 00:57:41,651
AJ9K, hit it. Inputting data, running calculations,
processing results, simulations complete. All

604
00:57:41,671 --> 00:57:47,355
right, this was a fun matchup. This was a lot
of fun, actually. Yeah, the goal was to at

605
00:57:47,455 --> 00:57:52,779
some point make people sick to their stomach
while listening to the speculation. So if we

606
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:59,148
were successful in that, I think we did our
jobs here. Stat-wise, the teams were pretty

607
00:57:59,228 --> 00:58:05,214
interesting. I think especially the Marvel zombies,
considering the fact that they had increased

608
00:58:05,314 --> 00:58:09,798
durability from the fact that even if they're
injured, they could essentially still keep

609
00:58:09,878 --> 00:58:14,662
moving and fighting. Right, their only weak
spot is their brain. But not only are they

610
00:58:14,722 --> 00:58:20,167
all highly durable like that, they're also insanely
fast thanks to the power cosmic. Their damage

611
00:58:20,207 --> 00:58:24,830
level is really high as well as their range.
Yeah, I was pretty nervous about that until

612
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:30,713
I looked at my lineup and realized, you know,
all of my guys are pretty powerful even without

613
00:58:30,733 --> 00:58:34,775
the power of cosmic. You know, Superman, Wonder
Woman, Black Adam, Martian Manhunter, those

614
00:58:34,815 --> 00:58:40,258
are among the strongest characters in DC to
begin with. It's just that as the anti-living,

615
00:58:40,798 --> 00:58:45,560
it's sort of like no holds barred. There's no
like restraints on them. Yeah, but their minds

616
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:52,084
are also all gone, replaced by the will of Erebus.
So all of the deceased got a knock on the intelligence

617
00:58:52,104 --> 00:58:57,327
stat, whereas the Marvel zombies all retained
their normal intelligence. And that was actually

618
00:58:57,828 --> 00:59:03,191
the greatest variance in all of the stat categories
between the two teams, because a lot of the

619
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:10,316
Marvel zombies are really smart, including Iron
Man, Spider-Man, Hulk, Ant-Man. Yes, yes, stat

620
00:59:10,356 --> 00:59:14,499
wise, the Marvel zombies are pretty impressive.
But, you know, I could say the same thing about

621
00:59:14,539 --> 00:59:20,475
the deceased. So taking all of the stats into
account. Joseph, who do you think came out

622
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:26,239
on top? Marvel zombies because they can last
longer in battle and they have the power cosmic,

623
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:33,084
which you don't fuck with. Although the Instagram
poll takers don't agree with me. Actually 55%

624
00:59:33,104 --> 00:59:38,367
of them on Instagram said that DC East was gonna
take this. Again, I have to chalk this up to

625
00:59:38,547 --> 00:59:45,813
too many damn DC fans following us on Instagram.
Marvel guys, have a seat, sit down. Okay, we

626
00:59:45,833 --> 00:59:50,866
gotta have a talk. You guys gotta, you guys
gotta show up. I'm just, I'm just gonna say

627
00:59:50,886 --> 00:59:55,128
you gotta show up, you gotta follow us on Instagram,
you gotta take part in the polls, we gotta

628
00:59:55,148 --> 01:00:01,109
start winning these voting contests because
the DC guys are showing you guys up, right?

629
01:00:01,149 --> 01:00:05,711
Dude, I was actually really surprised to see
that more people voted for deceased considering

630
01:00:05,751 --> 01:00:10,152
the fact that I feel like Marvel Zombies is
really popular, even going so far as to have

631
01:00:10,172 --> 01:00:14,753
their own episode in What If. Yeah, you and
me both, you and me both. Well, let's find

632
01:00:14,793 --> 01:00:21,373
out who actually won. AG 9K, the results please.
Hey, you are, sir. All right. The winner of

633
01:00:21,413 --> 01:00:32,821
the team duel between the deceased and the Marvel
zombies is. Deceased. Fuck you. What? And,

634
01:00:33,121 --> 01:00:39,406
you know, for as different as the teams were,
it was close. The deceased one in even five

635
01:00:39,446 --> 01:00:46,122
hundred and thirty of the one thousand matches
or 53 percent compared to Marvel's. 47 percent.

636
01:00:46,483 --> 01:00:51,766
So Marvel won 470 matches out of a thousand.
Right. And honestly, I'm not going to lie.

637
01:00:52,347 --> 01:00:59,632
I'm going to chalk this win up to the excellent
roster choices made by our executive producers.

638
01:01:00,192 --> 01:01:04,015
Well, like I told them that they didn't stand
a chance because all the Marvel zombies had

639
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:07,918
the power of cosmic. So I feel like they just
had to pick the most powerful people they could

640
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:12,601
think of. Yeah. And that's essentially what
I have on my roster, which I'm pretty proud

641
01:01:12,661 --> 01:01:18,818
of. And I have to wholeheartedly dedicate this
win to our executive producers for their fantastic

642
01:01:18,838 --> 01:01:24,763
work. I think we should replace Marsha Manhunter
and Big Barda and Black Adam with Green Arrow

643
01:01:25,003 --> 01:01:30,928
and The Question and Oracle. Then let's rerun
the stats. I don't remember The Question being

644
01:01:30,968 --> 01:01:36,553
in the series, but Batgirl was, Green Arrow
was, they were both zombies, but Batgirl was

645
01:01:36,573 --> 01:01:41,957
killed right away by Harley Quinn. And Green
Arrow was not a zombie for very long. Before

646
01:01:41,977 --> 01:01:47,965
he was cured? Yeah, he was cured. Okay, interesting.
Well, I'm starting to regret this whole team

647
01:01:47,985 --> 01:01:54,850
duel now. And all around winning for Team DC.
Good job. That was a really fun match, but

648
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:58,513
