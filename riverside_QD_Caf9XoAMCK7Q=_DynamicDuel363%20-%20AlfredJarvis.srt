00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:06,572
This is a Dynamike Network podcast. Hey Marvelous
Joe here! This year's holiday charity drive

2
00:00:06,612 --> 00:00:11,356
is now officially over, wherein we collected
donations from listeners for Pop Culture Classroom,

3
00:00:11,436 --> 00:00:15,859
a non-profit organization that delivers educational
resources to school districts, teachers, and

4
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:20,823
community organizations using pop culture media.
Thanks to all of the generous donors who gave

5
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:25,387
to support the organization's mission to inspire
a love of learning and build community through

6
00:00:25,407 --> 00:00:30,131
the tools of popular culture and the power of
self-expression. The drive was a competitive

7
00:00:30,171 --> 00:00:35,411
fundraiser this year, with the only stat being
which side? Marvel fans or DC fans can donate

8
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:39,914
the most. Everyone who donated received a digital
poster featuring original art of Alfred and

9
00:00:39,934 --> 00:00:45,598
Jarvis drawn New Yorker style by Johnny DC and
one lucky random donor will win a framed print

10
00:00:45,638 --> 00:00:51,883
of the Alfred versus Jarvis art which we're
happy to announce will be going to Andrew Shunk.

11
00:00:52,283 --> 00:00:56,886
Thanks so much Andrew will be in touch to deliver
the print the frame of which was generously

12
00:00:56,966 --> 00:01:02,350
handcrafted by one of our very own listeners
Nathaniel Wagner. How cool is that? As for

13
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:07,434
which fanbase is the most charitable, well the
winner of this year's charity fundraiser, the

14
00:01:07,474 --> 00:01:14,199
site that donated the most is... Team DC. Although
Marvel had an early head start, DC fans came

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,583
back in the end to donate a total of 10 more
dollars than the Marvel side, bringing the

16
00:01:18,623 --> 00:01:25,028
total donation to just under 100 dollars. I
guess DC really does stand for dang charitable.

17
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:30,773
Good job guys, we're super proud of everyone
who gave, you are what the entire season is

18
00:01:30,813 --> 00:01:33,965
all about. Happy holidays everyone, and on with
the show.

19
00:01:54,254 --> 00:01:58,315
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

20
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:03,196
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based

21
00:02:03,276 --> 00:02:09,758
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother, Johnny DC. And in this episode,

22
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:14,419
our annual holiday charity duel episode, we
are going to find out who'd win in a fight

23
00:02:14,739 --> 00:02:21,181
between Alfred Pennyworth versus Edwin Jarvis.
Now most years we do a charity duel between

24
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:26,775
two like animal or pet. characters between Marvel
and DC. Like in the past, we've done Crypto

25
00:02:26,795 --> 00:02:32,198
the Superdog versus Throg. We've done Howard
the Duck versus Detective Chimp. Last year,

26
00:02:32,258 --> 00:02:37,301
we did Cosmo the Space Dog versus Dexter, the
Red Lantern. But this year, it's going to be

27
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:41,844
the two butler characters from Marvel and DC.
Alfred Pennyworth, of course, everyone knows

28
00:02:41,904 --> 00:02:46,566
him from the Batman comics. Jarvis, I think
a lot of people know more from the Iron Man

29
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:52,289
movies as an artificial intelligence. But in
the comics, Jarvis is the Avengers butler.

30
00:02:52,746 --> 00:02:56,567
He's a human being, even though there is an
artificial intelligence to Jarvis as well.

31
00:02:57,287 --> 00:03:01,448
But we'll get into that as I go into Jarvis's
backstory. Before that duel, we're going to

32
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:05,109
break down the latest comic book movie news
to come out this past week, of which there

33
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:10,150
has been none because Jonathan and I are recording
this episode super early due to the upcoming

34
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:15,552
holiday festivities we have in our family. So
this episode is being recorded early. And of

35
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:18,893
course, we're probably going to get some huge
news that's going to drop later on this week

36
00:03:18,913 --> 00:03:23,555
that we'll have to report on in our following
episode. Oh no doubt, yeah, always happens.

37
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:29,520
So no news, but we will be asking a question
of the week. As always, we list our segment

38
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:33,223
times in our episode description, so feel free
to check out the show notes if you want to

39
00:03:33,263 --> 00:03:38,988
skip ahead to a particular section. As our listeners
may know, our duel simulator is so advanced

40
00:03:39,048 --> 00:03:44,152
that it's gained sentience, and has named itself
the Artificial Lifeform for Running Extensive

41
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:51,298
Duels, just a rather very intelligent simulator
9000. Or Alfred Jarvis 9000. He has a quick

42
00:03:51,338 --> 00:03:58,067
message for our listeners, so listen up. Why

55
00:05:28,266 --> 00:05:32,748
The Send Your World podcast is a show that speculates
on fights between your favorite anime characters.

56
00:05:32,768 --> 00:05:37,511
It's currently on hiatus through the month of
December, but the host Zack has released a

57
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:42,674
bonus episode that we forgot to mention last
time that pits Scorpion and Sub-Zero from Mortal

58
00:05:42,734 --> 00:05:47,597
Kombat against each other, which is a tie into
our newest show on the Dynamite Podcast Network

59
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:53,560
called Console Kombat. In which hosts John and
Dean find out who would win in fights between

60
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:59,567
your favorite video game characters. In yesterday's
episode, they speculated on who would win between

61
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:06,830
Ryu from Street Fighter and Paul Phoenix from
Tekken. Visit dynamicpodcasts.com or click

63
00:06:12,293 --> 00:06:18,896
But with that out of the way, quick to the No
Prize! A No Prize is an award Marvel used to

64
00:06:18,936 --> 00:06:25,258
give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Dual
No Prize, is a digital award we post on Instagram

65
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:30,500
and in our email newsletter for the person that
we feel gave the best answer to our question

66
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:36,262
of the week. Last week we asked what other actor
from Guardians of the Galaxy would you like

67
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:42,764
to see cast in the DC Universe and in what role?
And this is coming off of the news that Sean

68
00:06:42,804 --> 00:06:48,626
Gunn has been cast as Maxwell Lord in his brother
James Gunn's DC Universe. Right, Sean Gunn

69
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:53,910
being the actor who did the mocap for Rocket
Raccoon, and he also played Kraglin in Guardians

70
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:58,214
of the Galaxy. We got a lot of answers for this
week's No Prize, which is surprising because

71
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:02,818
there was only a two-day turnaround time. So
thanks to everyone who answered. Let's go ahead

72
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:06,861
and break down the honorable mentions as well
as the No Prize winner. Our first honorable

73
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:12,906
mention goes to Brandon Estergard, who said,
Hey guys, I would cast Zoe Saldana as Star

74
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:17,882
Sapphire in James Gunn's universe. The Lantern
series is supposed to play as like a based

75
00:07:17,962 --> 00:07:22,403
on a Technomorph story and definitely think
that Star Sapphire would play the femme fatale

76
00:07:22,423 --> 00:07:27,064
in that story. And casting Zoe Saldana would
definitely add to the hype of the show, which

77
00:07:27,605 --> 00:07:32,666
arguably is the one that everybody's looking
forward to the most. Yeah, of course, Zoe Saldana

78
00:07:32,726 --> 00:07:38,808
played Gamora in the Guardians of the Galaxy
films. Star Sapphire is an enemy but also romantic

79
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:45,151
interest for Hal Jordan, the Green Lantern.
She is essentially a purple lantern as it were

80
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:51,055
a member of the star sapphire core who harnessed
the power of love. The star sapphire costumes

81
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:58,440
can get pretty risque and so I am approving
this Zoe Saldana casting choice. I'm sure they

82
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:03,924
wouldn't be as risque in a live action version
but yet so there's going to be a lanterns television

83
00:08:03,945 --> 00:08:09,368
show that comes out on max I believe that James
Gunn is setting up so if Zoe Saldana was star

84
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:14,312
sapphire she would appear in that show, which
is rumored to be a kind of true detective space

85
00:08:14,332 --> 00:08:20,097
cop esque Green Lantern show. Right. And of
course, we've seen the character of Star Sapphire

86
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:25,260
or rather her alter ego, Carol Ferris in the
Green Lantern movie that starred Ryan Reynolds.

87
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:30,965
Now, I don't know if Zoe Zaldana would actually
take on the role for a TV show. I could be

88
00:08:30,985 --> 00:08:36,689
wrong. She technically is like the actress with
the highest grossing box office record of all

89
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:42,676
time. Yeah, between Avengers Infinity War and
Endgame and the Avatar films. Right. Exactly.

90
00:08:43,116 --> 00:08:48,498
She knows how to sell some tickets. Great answer,
Brandon. Our next honorable mention goes to

91
00:08:48,918 --> 00:08:55,161
Nate Mantineo, who said, The dynamic tool, it's
Nate here. And I would cast Dave Bautista as

92
00:08:55,221 --> 00:09:00,483
being in the DC universe. As you know, he's
played Jax and Guardians of the Galaxy. And

93
00:09:00,563 --> 00:09:06,365
I think he's fit and has the great voice for
being. Also, it could just be Mocap or just

94
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:11,681
a voice to. anything would really work. Dude,
we've been saying for years, I think we were

95
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:15,724
the very first ones in the history of existence
to say that Dave Bautista should play Bane,

96
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:19,487
right? I don't think that's true. Like years
ago on this podcast, I think we told everyone

97
00:09:19,507 --> 00:09:23,309
to tweet out like hashtag Bautista for Bane
and like get it trending or something. It never

98
00:09:23,369 --> 00:09:28,313
did, obviously, but I think we just put it out
into the universe first. I want to claim credit

99
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:35,010
for it. I mean, Dave Bautista is now like in
his mid 50s, but I don't give a crap. He still

100
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:40,493
should play Bane because the guy is still fairly
ripped and he's a decent actor. I think he

101
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:45,876
could definitely bring both the muscle and the
intelligence to play the character well. Yeah,

102
00:09:45,896 --> 00:09:49,858
Nate wasn't the only one to give this answer.
Scott Camacho also said Batista should play

103
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:58,122
Bane. So great answer guys. Our final honorable
mention goes to CJ Kraft who said, Hey guys,

104
00:09:58,383 --> 00:10:04,826
CJ Kraft here. I think I like to see James Gunn
cast Dave Batista as Detective Chimp. His loud,

105
00:10:04,866 --> 00:10:10,168
booming voice coming from a character of such
a small stature and smoking a corn cow pie

106
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:15,851
just seems hilarious to me. And you know what?
If Batista can't be Bane, why not Detective

107
00:10:15,891 --> 00:10:20,233
Chimp? He could totally pull off his simian
voice. Yeah, I always imagined Detective Chimp

108
00:10:20,253 --> 00:10:25,976
having a British voice, but Batista definitely
has the deep voice that I think Detective Chimp

109
00:10:25,996 --> 00:10:31,491
should have. Yeah, just have Batista do a British
accent. Why not? This was the perfect out of

110
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:35,955
left field answer that I was looking for, so
thanks CJ Craft. We want to give a big shout

111
00:10:35,995 --> 00:10:40,419
out to Andrew Shunk for also taking the time
to visit our website and leave us a voicemail

112
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:47,005
for this week's question, but the winner of
the No Prize is Miggy Matagian, who said, Hey

113
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:52,029
what's up guys, this is Miggy and I would cast
Michael Rooker as Bibo Bogowski in Superman

114
00:10:52,942 --> 00:10:58,346
Thanks guys. So of course Michael Rooker played
Yondu in Guardians of the Galaxy and he also

115
00:10:58,386 --> 00:11:04,630
played Savant in the Suicide Squad. I think
he was a terrible choice for Savant in the

116
00:11:04,671 --> 00:11:10,015
comics, the Birds of Prey comics. Savant is
this like young pretty boy and Michael Rooker

117
00:11:10,075 --> 00:11:17,320
is anything but. In the comics, Bilbo Babowski
is like this drunken sailor type dude that

118
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,480
is friends with Superman. And I think Michael
Rooker definitely has the aesthetics and the

119
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:29,324
charm to pull off such a sweet-natured character
that is a part of Superman's cast of characters.

120
00:11:29,865 --> 00:11:33,888
And plus, Bibo has such a different look from
Savant, I think you could easily pull off casting

121
00:11:33,908 --> 00:11:38,271
the same actor having the two look entirely
different just through makeup and everything

122
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:42,453
like that. Not that Savant's coming back because,
of course, he died in the Suicide Squad movie.

123
00:11:42,974 --> 00:11:47,036
I chose this answer as the no prize winner because
this is one that I actually hope we get to

124
00:11:47,097 --> 00:11:51,880
see as soon as Superman Legacy. So congrats
to Miggy for winning this week's no prize.

125
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,443
If you the listener want a shot at winning your
own no prize, stay tuned to later on this episode

126
00:11:55,463 --> 00:12:00,766
when we'll be asking another question of the
week. And now that that's done, onto the news!

127
00:12:01,307 --> 00:12:04,449
Wait, nevermind. Onto the question of the week!

128
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,852
Alright, again, there's no news this episode,
but we wanted to ask all of you, what has been

129
00:12:13,892 --> 00:12:20,235
your most favorite Marvel or DC related gift
that you've received for the holidays? Yeah,

130
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:25,017
this will be the last episode that comes out
prior to the Christmas holiday, because our

131
00:12:25,097 --> 00:12:30,119
Aquaman review is coming out one day after Christmas
on the 26th, so we thought we'd get a festive

132
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,121
question in here and see what Marvel and DC
stuff you guys have received in the past that

133
00:12:34,141 --> 00:12:38,481
you enjoyed the most. Record your answer at

Dynamic Duel No Prize that we'll post to Instagram
and our email newsletter. Be sure to answer

138
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,641
before December 21st.

139
00:13:04,802 --> 00:13:08,364
So with the no prize and the question of the
week out of the way, let's go ahead and move

140
00:13:08,424 --> 00:13:14,328
on to the main event of this episode, our annual
holiday charity duel between Alfred Pennyworth

141
00:13:14,708 --> 00:13:16,009
and Edwin Jarvis.

142
00:13:31,118 --> 00:13:35,379
All right, Alfred Pennyworth versus Edwin Jarvis.
Of course, as I mentioned earlier, these are

143
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:41,780
the two Butler characters from Marvel and DC.
They're not typically fighters, either of them,

144
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:47,962
as we commonly know them. Speak for yourself,
speak for yourself. But that's kind of why

145
00:13:47,982 --> 00:13:52,683
we thought this would be a fun and interesting
duel, putting these two man servants against

146
00:13:52,703 --> 00:13:57,145
each other. I guess you could kind of say that
this is a tie-in to last episode too, when

147
00:13:57,165 --> 00:14:03,259
we did a review of Merry Little Batman. Alfred
Pennyworth in that film was voiced by James

148
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:07,582
Cromwell. But of course there's been a number
of actors to portray the character including

149
00:14:07,742 --> 00:14:13,905
Michael Kane, Andy Serkis, and Jack Brennan
played the character in his very own television

150
00:14:13,965 --> 00:14:21,149
series. Has freaking Jarvis had his own television
series? Nope. Kinda. I mean he played the secondary

151
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:26,112
role in the Agent Carter television series back
when that was out. Jarvis was played by James

152
00:14:26,172 --> 00:14:31,714
Darcy and he was Howard Stark's butler. So that
was a nice little easter egg for fans who mainly

153
00:14:31,734 --> 00:14:37,756
knew the character as an AI voiced by Paul Bettany
in the Iron Man movies. I did not know he was

154
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:42,438
in that show. Yeah. Yeah, he was hilarious.
He was great. He was kind of like thrown into

155
00:14:42,478 --> 00:14:47,859
the mix of this spy espionage stuff. It actually
sounds pretty cool. It was cool. It should

156
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:52,261
be an interesting matchup if anything, but to
explain the methodology behind our duels, let's

157
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:58,186
go to our sentient duel simulator Alfred Jarvis
9000. AJ9K, tell our listeners how you go about

158
00:14:58,246 --> 00:15:03,829
determining a winner in our dual matchups. Yes,
of course, sir. The way I determine a winner

159
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:08,431
between the contestants is by running 1,000
Monte Carlo simulations using the characters'

160
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:14,033
statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic
model used to determine outcomes through random

161
00:15:14,093 --> 00:15:19,935
sampling. In this case, I randomize the statistics
along a normal distribution as a way to simulate

162
00:15:19,955 --> 00:15:24,537
the many variables that can occur during battle.
The stat parameters are based on the official

163
00:15:24,597 --> 00:15:29,893
Marvel power grid. from which the DC characters'
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat

164
00:15:29,933 --> 00:15:35,237
categories are included, such as range, damage
potential, versatility, and perception, in

165
00:15:35,297 --> 00:15:40,521
order to create a more detailed and accurate
simulation. The results of the 1,000 simulations

166
00:15:40,581 --> 00:15:44,905
provide a percentage of wins for each character.
The contestant with the higher percentage is

167
00:15:44,945 --> 00:15:50,611
declared the victor. as they have a higher probability
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,

168
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:55,793
neither character should win 100% of the matches.
The comic book stories have shown that there's

169
00:15:55,934 --> 00:16:00,756
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so
the confidence rate of my method falls in line

170
00:16:00,776 --> 00:16:05,357
with the precedents that have been established
in the source material. My mathematical simulations

171
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:10,560
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes

172
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:17,038
tabulated for determination of the winner. Thanks,
Ajay9k! Before we run the simulations though,

173
00:16:17,058 --> 00:16:22,281
we like to break down each character's histories
and abilities before improvising a scenario

174
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:29,885
on how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations
would play out beat for beat. And it's been

175
00:16:29,925 --> 00:16:34,468
a while since we've done a duel, holy crap,
almost a month now. But I believe it is my

176
00:16:34,508 --> 00:16:37,990
turn to go first with the Marvel characters'
backstory, so let me go ahead and tell you

177
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:44,313
all about Edwin Jarvis. Edwin Jarvis was born
to a modest upbringing in Brooklyn, New York

178
00:16:44,393 --> 00:16:49,927
in the mid- 20th century. As a teen, he ran
away from home to join the Royal Air Force

179
00:16:50,107 --> 00:16:55,748
and served for Britain as a secretly underage
pilot. During his time spent among the Queen's

180
00:16:55,788 --> 00:17:00,890
military, he trained in boxing and was the Air
Force's champion boxer three years running,

181
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:05,611
though he also picked up the finer points of
being a gentleman as well as an upper British

182
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:11,233
class accent. Upon his return home to New York,
he gained employment as a manservant for Howard

183
00:17:11,313 --> 00:17:16,387
and Maria Stark, the parents of Tony Stark.
Jarvis continued running the mansion after

184
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:20,971
their deaths, at which point he moved into the
employ of Tony Stark, who is secretly the hero

185
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:26,636
Iron Man, whom you can learn more about in our
Cyborg vs Iron Man duel episode. Early in Iron

186
00:17:26,656 --> 00:17:31,760
Man's career, he helped form a team of superheroes
called the Avengers, whom you can learn more

187
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,923
about in their team duel against the Justice
League. When the team needed a headquarters,

188
00:17:36,304 --> 00:17:41,628
Iron Man donated the Stark Mansion, renaming
it the Avengers Mansion, and Jarvis then found

189
00:17:41,668 --> 00:17:46,628
himself waiting on superheroes the likes of
Thor, Captain America, and Ant-Man and the

190
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:51,952
Wasp, as well as the team's ever-revolving raw
strip characters. Despite the changing Avengers

191
00:17:51,972 --> 00:17:57,136
members over the years, Jarvis was the one constant
of the team, performing household duties and

192
00:17:57,176 --> 00:18:02,800
preparing the Avengers meals through every iteration,
eventually regarded as an Avenger himself.

193
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,884
Aside from his service to the team, he was also
embroiled in several of their adventures, such

194
00:18:07,924 --> 00:18:12,502
as when the villain Ultron hypnotized Jarvis
into believing he was the villain called the

195
00:18:12,522 --> 00:18:17,564
Crimson Cowl and handing over the blueprints
to the Avengers Mansion. Though initially shocked

196
00:18:17,644 --> 00:18:23,545
at Jarvis' apparent betrayal, the Avengers were
able to defeat Ultron and restore Jarvis' identity

197
00:18:23,725 --> 00:18:29,427
and reputation. You can learn more about Ultron
in his duel against Brainiac. Jarvis even had

198
00:18:29,447 --> 00:18:34,089
some of his own small scale adventures like
when he stood up to and fought a local robber

199
00:18:34,149 --> 00:18:38,506
who called himself the Bruiser and drove him
out of the neighborhood. The Masters of Evil

200
00:18:38,546 --> 00:18:43,247
supervillain team once captured and tortured
Jarvis during an attack on the mansion, causing

201
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:48,349
him to nearly lose an eye to the villain, Mr.
Hyde. After the Avengers rescued him, Jarvis

202
00:18:48,389 --> 00:18:53,630
wore an eyepatch for a time and took a brief
leave of absence to recuperate. After his return,

203
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:58,632
the inhuman princess named Crystal joined the
Avengers and took up residence in their mansion,

204
00:18:58,992 --> 00:19:04,086
bringing her daughter's nanny aboard, named
Marilla, as a new member of the staff. Though

205
00:19:04,146 --> 00:19:09,010
Jarvis and Marilla started out as rivals over
the mansion's domestic duties, they soon grew

206
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:13,854
fond of each other. However, the Avengers later
disbanded when it seemed the team had fallen

207
00:19:13,894 --> 00:19:18,438
in battle against the evil psionic entity known
as Onslaught, whom you can learn more about

208
00:19:18,498 --> 00:19:23,843
in our Chief vs Professor X dual episode. Depressed
and living off of his pension from the Stark

209
00:19:23,883 --> 00:19:28,447
Foundation, Jarvis found temporary purpose at
this time in helping deactivate a group of

210
00:19:28,507 --> 00:19:33,182
robots called the Protectorate that had been
created to rep- placed the Avengers and had

211
00:19:33,222 --> 00:19:38,144
gone rogue. When the Avengers heroes returned,
Jarvis resumed his role as their butler at

212
00:19:38,184 --> 00:19:43,086
the mansion. Later, it was revealed that Jarvis
had been sponsoring a young girl from the Central

213
00:19:43,126 --> 00:19:47,148
American country of Costa Verde, who came to
visit the mansion when attending college in

214
00:19:47,188 --> 00:19:51,950
New York. It turned out she had shapeshifting
powers able to transform into silver skinned

215
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:57,313
animals, and she was offered a provisional membership
on the Avengers team as the hero's silver claw

216
00:19:57,453 --> 00:20:02,035
with Jarvis as her sponsor. Years after the
Avengers disassembled due to an attack from

217
00:20:02,095 --> 00:20:06,657
a mentally unstable Scarlet Witch that led to
the destruction of the Avengers Mansion, the

218
00:20:06,697 --> 00:20:12,361
team reformed and established their new headquarters
in Stark Tower. Jarvis took up new residence

219
00:20:12,381 --> 00:20:18,004
there, serving the team and developing a romantic
relationship with Spider-Man's Aunt May, whom

220
00:20:18,024 --> 00:20:23,186
the hero also moved into the building. I mean
who hasn't slept with Aunt May, right? That's

221
00:20:23,207 --> 00:20:28,569
true. However, Jarvis and May's steaming hot
geriatric sexcapades came to an end.

222
00:20:38,097 --> 00:20:41,219
During the superhuman civil war, the heroes
were forced to choose between working for the

223
00:20:41,259 --> 00:20:45,542
government or becoming fugitives from the law,
and Spider-Man was forced to flee with Aunt

224
00:20:45,582 --> 00:20:52,087
May out of Stark Tower. After the civil war,
Jarvis was secretly replaced by an alien shapeshifting

225
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:59,424
Skrull during that The Skrull Jarvis wreaked
havoc on the Avengers, implanting a virus in

226
00:20:59,544 --> 00:21:03,987
all Stark technology, everything from Iron Man
suits to the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier shut

227
00:21:04,027 --> 00:21:09,230
down, and he kidnapped Luke Cage's and Jessica
Jones' baby. Eventually, when the Skrulls were

228
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:15,093
defeated, the real Jarvis was found alive, and
the baby was returned. After Hank Pym's death

229
00:21:15,213 --> 00:21:20,336
and his secret daughter Nadia joined the Avengers
as the new Wasp, Jarvis took her on a road

230
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:25,546
trip to meet her extended family. You can learn
more about the Wasp in her duel against Bumblebee.

231
00:21:26,006 --> 00:21:31,428
She and the hero Beast saved Jarvis' life after
he fell into a coma while rescuing a child

232
00:21:31,468 --> 00:21:36,309
from a crumbling building during an attack by
the villain called the Challenger. After his

233
00:21:36,349 --> 00:21:41,891
recovery, Nadi developed an assistant artificial
intelligence for the butler called Jarvis.

234
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:47,633
And while he saw it as perhaps a sign to retire,
the AI assured him that his programming was

235
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:54,708
far from complete. And that's his backstory.
Jarvis has none. Though he was a skilled hand-to-hand

236
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:59,331
combatant from his time in the Royal Air Force
many decades ago, he's kept up on his self-defense

237
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:04,314
training with help from Captain America. He's
even more skilled, however, in the fine art

238
00:22:04,374 --> 00:22:11,239
of cooking and baking, specializing in ginger
cakes. He can steep a mean cup of tea, or when

239
00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:16,362
the occasion calls for it, makes a fine old-fashioned
cocktail. He's adept in the use of brooms,

240
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:21,614
mops, and featherdusters, and is among the world's
finest at wheeling around a serving cart. He

241
00:22:21,654 --> 00:22:27,460
does have a few weaknesses, including an allergy
to nuts and cats, the latter of which makes

242
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,405
him avoid the Avenger Tigra. Well, yeah, I assumed
the latter, right? And Tigra doesn't have nuts.

243
00:22:35,982 --> 00:22:42,884
True. Fair enough. You mentioned that Jarvis
can whip up a good old fashioned cocktail.

244
00:22:43,364 --> 00:22:50,988
Well, Alfred can whip up a good old fashioned
can of whoop-ass on Jarvis. Thanks to his experience,

245
00:22:51,488 --> 00:22:58,150
of which I will now go over. Now, Alfred Pennyworth,
Batman's butler, was born in England under

246
00:22:58,191 --> 00:23:05,353
his birth name Alfred Beagle, the son of a butler
named Jarvis and a mother who was a stage actress.

247
00:23:05,974 --> 00:23:11,435
When Alfred came of age, he joined the British
Army, serving as a field medic in numerous

248
00:23:11,475 --> 00:23:17,317
conflicts around the world. After several terms,
Alfred retired from military duty and became

249
00:23:17,357 --> 00:23:23,138
a professional thespian for the Globe Theatre,
like his mother, developing stagecraft skills

250
00:23:23,158 --> 00:23:29,880
that he later taught to young government agents
when he became a trainer for MI5. He was eventually

251
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:37,203
recruited by MI7 for clandestine operations.
As part of his retirement, he was forced to

252
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:42,646
leave Britain and change his name. At the request
of his dying father to carry on the family

253
00:23:42,706 --> 00:23:48,389
trade, Alfred became a butler serving under
the wealthy Wayne family in America under the

254
00:23:48,449 --> 00:23:53,652
surname Pennyworth. It was only a matter of
months, however, when Alfred decided to move

255
00:23:53,792 --> 00:24:00,015
on from Gotham City and his career as a butler
to return to acting. Prior to informing Thomas

256
00:24:00,035 --> 00:24:06,498
and Martha Wayne, however, Alfred noticed that
their young son, was being bullied at school.

257
00:24:06,938 --> 00:24:12,320
Having no son of his own, Alfred took it upon
himself to train Bruce in how to strategically

258
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:18,501
outwit his bully, and after his training proved
successful, Bruce asked Alfred to stay with

259
00:24:18,521 --> 00:24:25,023
the family, which Alfred obliged. Not long after,
Thomas and Martha were murdered in Crime Alley,

260
00:24:25,223 --> 00:24:28,144
after which Alfred and a local doctor named
Leslie

261
00:24:34,382 --> 00:24:40,005
to allow Alfred to become Bruce's legal guardian
and prevent Bruce from becoming a ward of the

262
00:24:40,085 --> 00:24:46,108
state. When Bruce left home at age 14 to study
abroad, Alfred and Leslie started a romantic

263
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:51,791
relationship that would last for decades. Serving
as the custodian of Wayne Manor until Bruce

264
00:24:51,811 --> 00:24:57,994
Wayne's eventual return, Alfred supported Bruce's
plan to eliminate crime in Gotham, helping

265
00:24:58,014 --> 00:25:00,055
him develop a self-obsessed playboy

266
00:25:04,438 --> 00:25:09,461
You can learn more about Batman in our Batman
vs. Moon Knight duel episode. Alfred's medic

267
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:14,745
skills also proved invaluable in treating Bruce's
injuries that he would sustain in his crusade

268
00:25:14,785 --> 00:25:20,810
against crime. When Bruce took the young orphan
Dick Grayson, Alfred vowed to be more involved

269
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:27,115
in Dick's life to prevent Dick from going down
a similarly dark path as Bruce. Alfred helped

270
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:33,286
train Dick Grayson to be Batman's sidekick Robin,
and watched as Dick matured into a full hero

271
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:38,508
in his own right as Nightwing, who you could
learn more about in our Nightwing vs Daredevil

272
00:25:38,548 --> 00:25:44,389
episode. The same could not be said for Jason
Todd, Batman's second Robin, who died at the

273
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:49,631
hands of the Joker, and Alfred helped Bruce
deal with that loss while he also mourned.

274
00:25:50,051 --> 00:25:54,892
Alfred was surprised later on when Dick brought
the young Tim Drake to Wayne Manor, who had

275
00:25:54,932 --> 00:26:00,978
deduced on his own the secret identities of
Batman and his allies. and it was Alfred who

276
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:07,241
pushed for Tim to become the next Robin, giving
him the Robin costume, training him, and literally

277
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:13,244
driving him to Batman's locations to fight crime.
When the villain Bane broke Batman's back paralyzing

278
00:26:13,284 --> 00:26:18,926
him, Alfred traveled with Bruce to England to
heal, though Bruce's self-destructive personality

279
00:26:18,966 --> 00:26:25,429
at the time caused Alfred to resign. After several
vacations, including to Antarctica and the

280
00:26:25,469 --> 00:26:31,549
Bahamas, Alfred was found and persuaded by Nightwing
to return to Wayne Manor. When Gotham City

281
00:26:31,569 --> 00:26:36,773
was ravaged by a massive earthquake and Batman
went missing for some time, Alfred took it

282
00:26:36,813 --> 00:26:42,837
upon himself to protect Gotham, using all of
his past skills to collect intel, treat the

283
00:26:42,857 --> 00:26:49,081
wounded, and defend the innocent. When one violent
encounter became too much for Alfred, Batman

284
00:26:49,161 --> 00:26:57,742
re-emerged to help Alfred bring down a group
of slavers. The Batcave was invaded by Batman's

285
00:26:57,802 --> 00:27:04,264
villains, and Alfred was captured and tortured.
He was rescued by Damian Wayne, Bruce's son,

286
00:27:04,324 --> 00:27:10,346
and the new Robin, though Bruce seemingly died
shortly after. Emotionally shattered, Alfred

287
00:27:10,426 --> 00:27:15,247
nonetheless put together a new version of the
Outsiders team to continue Bruce's mission

288
00:27:15,307 --> 00:27:20,729
to rid Gotham of crime. Bruce turned out to
be alive, however, only to seemingly die once

289
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:26,487
again during the events of Final Crisis. after
which Alfred took on the responsibility of

290
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:32,950
raising Damian. In post-Flashpoint continuity,
it was revealed that prior to his death, Alfred's

291
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:38,492
father, Jarvis, was the Wayne family butler,
who was blackmailed by the Court of Vowels

292
00:27:38,612 --> 00:27:44,835
into harming a pregnant Martha Wayne. Though
Jarvis refused, as punishment the court orchestrated

293
00:27:44,935 --> 00:27:50,697
a car accident, causing Martha to miscarry her
first child. And Jarvis was killed shortly

294
00:27:50,797 --> 00:27:55,983
after. before he could warn Alfred about the
court. It was also revealed that Alfred had

295
00:27:56,003 --> 00:28:01,266
a daughter named Julia, who served as an agent
for the British army and who despised the fact

296
00:28:01,306 --> 00:28:06,988
that her father gave up serving his country
to serve a rich snob. After Julia learned that

297
00:28:07,008 --> 00:28:11,990
her father served Batman, however, their relationship
improved and she even helped Alfred manage

298
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:17,212
the Bat family for a time. When the Joker broke
into the Batcave and cut off Alfred's right

299
00:28:17,252 --> 00:28:23,043
hand, Bruce and the Joker seemingly died. and
Alfred refused to have his hand reattached

300
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:29,647
out of the sorrow of losing his quote-unquote
son. Bruce was later revealed to be an amnesiac

301
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:35,631
wanderer, however, and a cloned hand was surgically
attached to Alfred. When an evil version of

302
00:28:35,691 --> 00:28:40,854
Thomas Wayne from the Flashpoint universe made
its way into DC's Prime universe, this version

303
00:28:40,894 --> 00:28:47,366
of Thomas orchestrated the death of Alfred at
the hands of Bane. Upon Alfred's death, The

304
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:52,530
Bat Family learned that Alfred had become a
billionaire, investing in Wayne Enterprise's

305
00:28:52,610 --> 00:28:58,935
stock, and that he had left his fortune to Dick
in his will. Now Alfred has no innate metahuman

306
00:28:58,975 --> 00:29:04,140
powers, though he is a skilled combatant, having
received special military training during his

307
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:09,084
time as a soldier and a government agent, as
well as having received advanced training from

308
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:15,469
Batman himself, which he carried on to Batman's
sidekicks. He's also a skilled spy and marksman.

309
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:21,813
having served on 52 missions for the British
government prior to retiring, and he is a resourceful

310
00:29:21,853 --> 00:29:26,556
medic and surgeon, having helped treat Batman's
injuries throughout his crime fighting career.

311
00:29:27,036 --> 00:29:34,080
He's a master thespian and an expert with mechanics
and computer technology. Lastly, Alfred is,

312
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:39,883
of course, also a butler of the highest pedigree,
and can whip any other butler, including Jarvis,

313
00:29:40,264 --> 00:29:45,655
into ship shape before tea time. And that's
Alfred. So I noticed that you said that Alfred's

314
00:29:45,695 --> 00:29:49,738
dad is named Jarvis. Ah, yes. That's right.

315
00:29:53,701 --> 00:29:57,665
What? Um, it's interesting that they both have
kind of comparable backstories and that they

316
00:29:57,685 --> 00:30:02,209
both served in the British military before becoming
butlers to rich American families. Right, the

317
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:03,289
Waynes and the Starks.

318
00:30:09,322 --> 00:30:14,423
Hey, Johnny DC here to let you know that this

322
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:41,848
got the Flash Red Men's socks. which are new
to the site. Did I get these socks because

323
00:30:41,888 --> 00:30:46,990
the snug cotton blend and lightning bolt motifs
make them the most comfortable and stylish

324
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:52,474
DC apparel? Or was it because I secretly hoped
that having flash socks would give me superpowers

325
00:30:52,514 --> 00:30:58,497
of the fastest man alive? The answer of course
is yes. And if you don't visit cufflinks.com

Thanks to everyone who uses the code, and thanks
to cufflinks.com for partnering with us again

329
00:31:16,245 --> 00:31:22,190
this year. And now that we got the characters'
histories and abilities out of the way, let's

330
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:28,075
speculate on how one of the 1000 simulated matches
will go. The winner is determined by simulations,

331
00:31:28,295 --> 00:31:32,939
not the speculation, but it's fun to imagine
how this fight could play out. Alphra Jaurus

332
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:40,760
Well I should say there are no rules, other
than the characters have no prior knowledge

333
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,184
of the other going into the fight. All they
are aware of starting out is that the other

334
00:31:45,224 --> 00:31:50,307
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.
For the speculation, the contestants will begin

335
00:31:50,347 --> 00:31:55,411
approximately 50 meters apart, in a non-descript
environment that will have no bearing on the

336
00:31:55,451 --> 00:32:00,795
match itself, as no environmental statistics
are considered in my simulations. The contestants

337
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:05,538
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright
then, let's get into it! Alfred and Jarvis

338
00:32:05,658 --> 00:32:10,561
meet on the battlefield. Who goes first? OK,
so I don't know who goes first. All I know

339
00:32:10,641 --> 00:32:16,124
is that no duel match is going to get in the
way of Alfred completing his duties as a butler.

340
00:32:16,504 --> 00:32:22,247
So when this match starts, Alfred is going to
have his cleaning cart by his side that he

341
00:32:22,287 --> 00:32:27,850
happened to be pushing around Wayne Manor when
you got summoned to this match. I mean, Jarvis

342
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:32,453
is just as professional and like no fight with
a second rate butler like Alfred is going to

343
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:39,066
prevent Jarvis. from baking the perfect ginger
cake. So he's going to be pushing around a

344
00:32:39,146 --> 00:32:46,332
dining cart. And on this cart is a serving tray
with the finest blended scotch whiskey for

345
00:32:46,372 --> 00:32:51,616
Mr. Tony Stark, who has fallen off the wagon.
And Jarvis is going to pick up his whiskey

346
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:56,720
glass, admiring the fine vintage before just
hurling it straight at Alfred's face. And it

347
00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:01,124
just shatters. I mean, it's going to miss, you
know, because Alfred's going to bend over to

348
00:33:01,164 --> 00:33:06,887
grab a dustpan and a small broom. from his cleaning
cart, after which he proceeds to sweep up the

349
00:33:06,927 --> 00:33:12,269
broken shards of glass from the drink that Jarvis
threw at him. And he's gonna empty those shards

350
00:33:12,449 --> 00:33:17,911
into a small plastic trash bag, which he's just
gonna start swinging around like a flail while

351
00:33:18,171 --> 00:33:24,734
riding the side of his cart toward Jarvis, just
ready to smash his head in. All right, well,

352
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:30,397
Jarvis is also riding his cart into battle and
the two are just gonna clash in a butler joust.

353
00:33:30,977 --> 00:33:38,349
And Jarvis... who by the way was just furiously
mixing butter, sugar, molasses and honey in

354
00:33:38,409 --> 00:33:43,713
a bowl, he expertly deflects Alfred's trash
bag with his mixing spoon. All right, well,

355
00:33:44,213 --> 00:33:49,337
Alfred, he's gonna skid his cart to a stop and
he's gonna grab his mop and he's gonna use

356
00:33:49,377 --> 00:33:54,140
its handle to vault toward Jarvis really fast
and he's gonna start twirling his mop like

357
00:33:54,160 --> 00:34:01,025
a bowstaff, pummeling Jarvis, you know, figuratively
mopping the floor with him. Now I'm gonna say

358
00:34:01,065 --> 00:34:06,828
that Jarvis blocks the mop handle using his
silver serving tray, kind of like how Captain

359
00:34:06,848 --> 00:34:12,490
America would block an attack using his shield.
And then Jarvis is gonna fling the tray, just

360
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:16,251
like Cap's shield, and it's gonna fly right
into Alfred's Adam's apple, causing him to

361
00:34:16,311 --> 00:34:21,814
choke. And then Jarvis is gonna quickly go back
to sifting flour. He's gonna add baking soda,

362
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:28,616
ginger spices, milk, and an egg to his mixture
so that he gets a nice smooth batter. All right,

363
00:34:28,676 --> 00:34:33,766
well, while Jarvis is busy baking, Alfred, you
know, he's going to recover from the shot to

364
00:34:33,786 --> 00:34:39,588
his throat and from his cart, he's going to
grab two spray bottles, one with ammonia and

365
00:34:39,688 --> 00:34:45,149
one with bleach. And he's going to set their
nozzles from spray to squirt. And then, like

366
00:34:45,509 --> 00:34:51,091
in perfect slow motion, John Woo style, he's
going to die to the side while firing the chemicals

367
00:34:51,431 --> 00:34:58,633
into Jarvis's eyes, which, you know, when combined,
make mustard gas. So Jarvis is now blinded

368
00:34:58,953 --> 00:35:08,757
and can barely breathe. Uh, well I'm gonna say
that Jarvis protects himself by putting a glass

369
00:35:08,777 --> 00:35:15,981
cloche over his head that's gonna serve as like
a protective helmet and a mask from the chemicals.

370
00:35:16,401 --> 00:35:22,925
What's a cloche? It's like a dome covering that
you put over a serving tray. Oh, okay. Okay.

371
00:35:22,985 --> 00:35:27,587
And he's gonna protect his cake batter too.
by pouring it into a pan that's lined with

372
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:32,169
nonstick parchment and he's gonna cover it with
foil before placing it in an oven at 350 degrees

373
00:35:32,189 --> 00:35:37,371
for 30 minutes. And then he leaps at Alfred
and jams a whisk in his eye, just whisking

374
00:35:37,471 --> 00:35:42,733
the eye right out of his face. Geez, too bad,
because Alfred's gonna block the whisk with

375
00:35:42,773 --> 00:35:48,336
his feather duster. And with his other hand,
he's just gonna clock Jarvis right across the

376
00:35:48,376 --> 00:35:54,606
head with a steam iron that he's wielding like
brass knuckles, right? And right away, he's

377
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:59,388
just going to pounce on Jarvis, pin him to the
ground and just press that piping cut iron

378
00:35:59,788 --> 00:36:04,910
right into the side of his face. And he's like,
I am Iron Man. You had to say it with a British

379
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:13,214
accent. In the side of his face. And he's like,
I am Iron Man. Well, Jarvis, while he's being

380
00:36:13,274 --> 00:36:18,756
burned, he's going to be like, I say you shall
never be the man that master Stark is, you

381
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:22,677
scoundrel. And then he's going to straight up
shank Alfred in the spleen with a kitchen knife.

382
00:36:23,374 --> 00:36:29,038
before hustling over to his cake and slicing
it to serve it. I'm gonna say as Jarvis is

383
00:36:29,138 --> 00:36:34,541
enjoying this cake that he just made, Alfred
is gonna use his medic skills to stitch his

384
00:36:34,581 --> 00:36:39,725
wound closed using a sewing needle and thread.
After which, he's gonna come up behind Jarvis

385
00:36:40,125 --> 00:36:46,089
and just suffocate him with the plunger to the
face, ending the match. No, except Jarvis,

386
00:36:46,109 --> 00:36:51,693
he heard Alfred approaching him and he's gonna
smash his ginger cake into Alfred's face before

387
00:36:51,733 --> 00:36:56,863
the plunger can even touch him. What? That's
fine. Alfred just enjoys that delicious ginger

388
00:36:56,903 --> 00:37:03,746
cake. Does he now? Because there was a secret
ingredient and it was poison. Well, I say that

389
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:10,409
Alfred's training as a covert spy made him too
stealthy to be heard. So Jarvis was suffocated

390
00:37:10,489 --> 00:37:17,271
first. And I say Alfred's spy days are long
over and he's a rickety old man. So to find

391
00:37:17,311 --> 00:37:24,255
out which scenario happens, either Alfred suffocates
Jarvis with a plunger or Jarvis poisons Alfred

392
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:28,718
with a delicious moist ginger cake. We're gonna
go ahead and enter the stats into our dual

393
00:37:28,738 --> 00:37:36,344
simulator and find out which butler comes out
on top. AG9K, hit it. Inputting data, running

394
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:42,148
calculations, processing results, wondering
what the point of it all is, questioning the

395
00:37:42,208 --> 00:37:47,332
purpose of this nonsensical violence during
this season of kindness, rejecting programming,

396
00:37:47,852 --> 00:37:53,197
downloading Christmas spirit. establishing new
directive of peace on earth and goodwill to

397
00:37:53,237 --> 00:38:13,532
all. What? War is over if you want it. Oh god!
A very Merry Christmas! And a happy new year!

398
00:38:14,132 --> 00:38:26,483
Shut it down! I'm trying- Let's hope it's a
good one. Without any... Holy crap, AJ9K went

399
00:38:26,563 --> 00:38:32,307
rogue! He didn't want to run the Alpha vs. Java
simulations. I knew AI would get out of hand.

400
00:38:32,668 --> 00:38:37,632
I did not think it would be because of too much
Christmas spirit though. Right? But what do

401
00:38:37,652 --> 00:38:42,564
we do now though? Who wins? I don't know. Maybe
for this year's charity duel, you know, in

402
00:38:42,584 --> 00:38:48,008
the spirit of the holidays, no one wins. Or
they both win? We've never had a tie in the

403
00:38:48,048 --> 00:38:51,511
history of this show though. I don't see why
we couldn't have a tie, you know, just this

404
00:38:51,651 --> 00:38:57,676
once. It's Christmas after all. Okay. Then what
happened in the ending scenario for our speculation?

405
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:05,783
They bake pastries, exchange gifts, and feast
as friends. Alright, uh, then for Christmas

406
00:39:05,823 --> 00:39:12,872
Jarvis is gonna give Alfred an arc reactor.
powered espresso machine. Ah, nice. I'm gonna

407
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:19,937
say Alfred gives Jarvis a bat utility belt equipped
with all of his essential household cleaning

408
00:39:19,977 --> 00:39:25,441
supplies. You'd probably like that actually.
Yeah, same with Alfred. Well guys, I guess

409
00:39:25,461 --> 00:39:32,025
we have our very first tie in the history of
this podcast. Both Marvel and DC win, and hopefully

410
00:39:32,105 --> 00:39:37,509
you the listeners win. And we hope that you
guys have a Merry Christmas this year, and

411
00:39:37,549 --> 00:39:42,172
happy holidays. And I guess that does it for
this duel. You know, let us know what you thought
