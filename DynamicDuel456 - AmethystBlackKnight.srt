00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,960
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi, welcome to
the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,980
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:38,020
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Johnny DC and I'm his twin

4
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:44,200
brother, Marvelous Joe. And in this episode, we
are doing a duel between the sword-wielding,

5
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:51,120
fantasy-esque characters of DC's Amethyst and
Marvel's Black Knight. Yeah, Black Knight is

6
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,960
actually one of my favorite characters. I don't
know why, but I've always just kind of gravitated

7
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,840
toward him. I was really excited when he was in the
Eternals movie played by Kit Harrington,

8
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,080
although it was just Dane Whitman. We didn't
actually get to see the Black Knight. Maybe

9
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:08,600
eventually we'll get to see the character in the
MCU at some point. But I know for a fact that we will

10
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,260
never see Amethyst in live action. That's all I
know. Well, that's not true at all. Actually,

11
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,420
James Gunn has hinted that they're looking into
doing an Amethyst movie. He's hinted at a lot of

12
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,360
things. Okay? Amethyst would actually be a
spectacular movie. It's like the ultimate girl

13
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:30,820
fantasy story. It's an Isakai where she's like a
forgotten lost princess. It's tailor-made for

14
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:36,480
that demographic. Cool. Yeah, it is. I have
daughters. It's really cool. I have a daughter

15
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:41,420
too, but there's no way I'd ever let her watch it.
Not because it wouldn't be good, but because it's

16
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:47,280
DC and it's forbidden in my house. Oh yeah, I get
that. To this day, like anytime we put in a new

17
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,200
movie, my girls ask me, wait, is this a Marvel
movie? Are you trying to trick us into watching a

18
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Marvel movie? And I'm like, why would I do that? You
indoctrinating piece of shit. Well, I hope Black

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,780
Knight wins because of that and we'll get into that
matchup later on this episode. Before that, we're

20
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,340
going to break down the latest comic book,
actually video game news that came out this past

21
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,639
week. Yeah, there's not a lot of movie news, but we
did get the official gameplay trailer for

22
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:14,700
Marvel's Wolverine. That's going to be on the
PlayStation. As always, we list our segment times

23
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:18,880
in our episode description, so feel free to check
out the show notes if you want to skip ahead to a

24
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,260
particular topic. Our artificially intelligent
dual simulator, AJ9K, has a quick message for our

25
00:02:24,260 --> 00:03:13,300
listeners. So listen up. Thanks AJ9K and thanks to
everyone who supports the podcast. Guys, be sure

26

to tune into the other shows and the Dynamite
Podcast Network this week, including the console

27
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,880
combat podcast, where hosts John and Dean
simulate battles between popular video game

28
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,820
characters. In yesterday's episode, they
determined who would win between Nightmare of

29
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:33,960
Soul Calibur and War from Darksiders. Over on the
Max Destruction podcast, hosts Scotty and Gilly

30
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,200
pay your favor action heroes from film and
television against each other. On Wednesday,

31
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,740
they're going to find out who would win between
Werewolf by Night and Van Helsing. Werewolf by

32
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,000
Night's obviously going to take that, obviously.
No, no. It's Van Helsing, dude. He could transform

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,620
into a Werewolf. That's true. The Hugh Jackman
version, right? Yeah, that's the version they're

34
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:59,120
going with. The Hugh Jackass version. What the
fuck did you just say? The Hugh Jackoff version.

35
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,700
Oh, okay. On the Central World podcast, hosts
Zachary Hepburn speculates on fights between fan

36
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,720
favorite anime and manga characters. In his next
episode, Zach is revealing who would win between

37
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:16,019
Whitebeard and Kampachi, both from One Piece.

our show notes to listen to all of the shows in the
Dynamite Podcast Network. But with that out of the

39
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:29,460
way, quick to the no prize. A no prize is an award
that Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version,

40
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,400
the Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award we
post on Instagram for the person that We Feel gave

41
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,720
the best answer to our question of the week. Last
week, we asked you guys, what was your favorite

42
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:47,060
story within the Deadpool Batman crossover comic
book and why? And we got one answer. Yeah, I don't

43
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,120
know if a whole lot of listeners of this show
actually read the comic books because, yeah, only

44
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:58,940
a single person called in. So congrats to Noah
Terry, you win this week's no prize. And he said,

45
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:05,400
hey guys, within the Deadpool slash Batman
crossover comic, we all know the best story and

46
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,500
that's the dead of night where the dark night and
the merc with the mouth meet up. It's just the

47
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:15,240
perfect team up. I never knew I needed it. It's
hilarious. The art is amazing. The story is

48
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,360
fantastic. I'm not saying the other stories
weren't solved, but this was definitely a no

49
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,780
brainer first pick for me. So that's my answer.
Thanks. Bye guys. I think one of the best things

50
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:32,780
about the Deadpool Batman crossover comic book
was how clearly the writer seemed to nail Ryan

51
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:39,940
Reynolds voice. Just his comedic style that the
character has used in the films, which is mostly on

52
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:45,300
par with Deadpool's comedic style from the comic
books. It was just a joy to read when I read Deadpool

53
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,780
comic books. Now it's definitely in Ryan Reynolds
voice. When I read Batman, it's definitely in

54
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:55,280
Kevin Conroy's voice. The Joker showed up in that
issue. I definitely read it in Mark Hamill's voice

55
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:02,420
and it was all just so well written and clear and
hilarious on top of everything else. It was such a

56
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:07,380
blast. Like Noah said, it was the crossover event.
I didn't know I needed. Yeah, I was not really

57
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:13,580
looking forward to a Deadpool Batman crossover
because we've had so many Batman crossovers. I

58
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:19,060
never really wanted to see him go up against
Deadpool, not realizing that they are the perfect

59
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:24,980
foils for each other. And it just made for a really,
really fun story. And yeah, I totally read

60
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:30,520
Deadpool in Ryan Reynolds voice. And I think it's
because it was written by Zeb Wells, who was the

61
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:36,440
co-writer on the Deadpool and Wolverine movie.
Yeah, absolutely. So he definitely knew the tone

62
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,280
of the character and how to nail that. You're
right. They were the perfect foils for each other.

63
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:46,140
I love how Batman just could not tolerate Deadpool
shit and Deadpool could not help but love how cool

64
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:51,240
Batman was. It was great. It was great. But besides
that one, what was your favorite storyline? Well,

65
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,080
as much as I wanted to like the Daredevil green
arrow crossover, it was too cliche for me, which

66
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,140
was surprising. Given that it was written by Kevin
Smith, who was a solid comic book writer. I think

67
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:07,400
actually the one that surprised me the most was the
Wonder Woman and Captain America crossover. Oh,

68
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,940
man. Because the reveal that it was a conjoined
Marvel and DC universe out of the multiverse was a

69
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,780
pretty good twist. And it totally makes sense that
Wonder Woman and Steve Rogers would be into each

70
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,320
other because Steve Rogers is a lot like Steve
Trevor, you know, they would totally get it on.

71
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,840
Dude, I want more from the Infinityverse. I think
that's what they called it in that storyline.

72
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,240
Yeah. Because that was spectacular. I was
actually going to choose that one, too. But I guess

73
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,480
if I had to choose another one that I really liked,
it would have been the Rocket Raccoon and Green

74
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,320
Lantern crossover. Where it was like the
Guardians of the Universe and the Guardians of the

75
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,880
Galaxy. I thought that was pretty cool,
especially with that twist ending where Hal

76
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:49,880
Jordan gets the Infinity Gauntlet. Right. And
that was pretty good. Well, thanks, Noa Terry, for

77
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,460
reading the comic book and for calling in with your
answer. You win this week's No Prize. If you the

78
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,580
listener want a shot at winning your own No Prize,
stay tuned till later on this episode when we'll be

79
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:09,100
asking another. Question of the week. And now that
that's done, on to the news. All right, this past

80
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:16,120
week we got the first official gameplay trailer
for the upcoming Wolverine video game made by

81
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:23,240
Insomniac for the PlayStation 5. It's coming out
late in 2026. About a year from now. It looks really

82
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,980
damn good. As good as the Spider-Man game is for the
character of Spider-Man, this game looks like the

83
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:34,360
same level of quality for the character of
Wolverine. The movement of the character through

84
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,900
the environment, the camera motions and the fight
mechanics look just so well polished and true to

85
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:47,140
character. It just looks amazing. And hyper
violent as it should. Right. I mean, I would expect

86
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:52,640
no less from a Wolverine video game where you
straight up stab people in the face. I will say that

87
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,940
this trailer got more violent than I was
expecting. It's definitely rated to

88
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:02,340
infirmature. We're talking like Mortal Kombat
levels of violence as opposed to like Spider-Man

89
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:08,800
levels of violence from that video game. We see him
straight up rip dudes in half down the middle. And

90
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,100
what I thought was interesting too is that these
guys are also like part robots seemingly or

91
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,700
they're wearing like some high tech gear. I
thought we would have seen Wolverine turn to a

92
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,720
couple of robots, but they're like, no, all
humans. Yeah, these robots are going to have

93
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,640
blood, right? He's not just tearing through
circuitry here. We're going to make sure that

94
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,140
they're at least cyborgs. So there's some blood is
what the developers said. It looks like we get so

95
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:37,040
many different classic versions of Wolverine
because the character is just so versatile in the

96
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:43,380
world of Marvel. He fits right at home, you know, in
Westchester with Xavier school as a teacher, but

97
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:49,060
he can also feel very Western, you know, with his
cowboy hat and stuff. He could also feel very like

98
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:55,540
East Asian with stories set in Japan or Madropore
or like in the middle of a Canadian forest in the

99
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,780
Rockies in the mountains, being a wild animal in
the snow in the city. There's just so many

100
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:05,600
different directions you can take the character
and to that end, we're getting a whole lot more

101
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,940
level designs here than we do from like your
typical Insomniac Spider-Man game, which

102
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:15,220
largely takes place in Manhattan. Yeah, when you
compare this to something like Batman Arkham

103
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,200
Knight or Arkham City, which takes place entirely
in Gotham or like you mentioned, the Spider-Man

104
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:26,100
games, this doesn't feel open world to me, but
that's not a bad thing. No, not necessarily. It

105
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:32,180
looks very level based. I don't think you could
actually like walk from the Canadian Rockies to

106
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:36,640
Japan in this game. I don't think it is open world
like those other games, but I might be wrong. You

107
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:41,160
know, you may just have to go to the airport and then
there'll be a cutscene where he's traveling or

108
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,960
something. He does have his motorcycle in a few of
these levels, which looks super sick wearing the

109
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:51,460
yellow costume, the yellow costume, which looks
very influenced by the design that was in the MCU in

110
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:56,780
the Deadpool and Wolverine film. It looks really
cool. I guess the one nitpick I have and this

111
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:01,860
definitely is a nitpick because I brought it up
with our executive producers and Zach kind of set

112
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,120
me straight because I was talking about how the
fight system incorporates so many different

113
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:10,620
things. So many combos, kind of like with
Spider-Man, that it's kind of ridiculous because

114
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:16,960
it makes no sense for a guy to still be standing
after the first Adamantium Claw slash, right?

115
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,460
Like if you get slash with Adamantium Claw, you're
basically done. But some of these combos in this

116
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:29,160
Wolverine game fight system incorporate like 10
plus hits, which is just kind of ridiculous. It's

117
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:34,280
such overkill. But Zach, one of our executive
producers and the host of Central World was like,

118
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:39,760
yeah, but Wolverine's kind of about overkill when
he's in his berserker rage modes, to which, you

119
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,380
know, that's fair. Yeah, he'll keep slashing even
though you're dead. Yeah, I mean, like if you get

120
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:50,140
slashed in the face, do you really need to be
slashed in the chest and in the gut and in the arm and

121
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:55,620
in the neck and in the face again? I don't think so.
Yes, according to Wolverine. It's just not a very

122
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,880
efficient fighting style. I'll say that. It looks
like Omega Red is going to be one of the villains.

123
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:06,040
Yeah, we see Omega Red. We see Mystique in the video
game. There's a Sentinel, which looks like it is

124
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,900
going to be a really cool fight scene. I don't know
who the main bad guy is. If it's like, I don't know,

125
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,780
Saber Tooth or Romulus. I hope it's not Romulus. I
hate that character, but somebody else will have

126
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:22,980
to wait and see. So are you picking up PlayStation 5
for this? Maybe. I mean, I'm overdue on playing the

127
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,500
Insomniac Spider-Man games. If this game does
really well too, it sounds like Insomniac is going

128
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:34,000
to make a whole lot more Marvel video games. And I
just need to get back up on that horse, on that video

129
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,580
game horse, because I haven't been a big gamer in
about five or 10 years now. I bought an Xbox One just

130
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:45,440
to play Arkham Knight and Injustice 2. And once I
beat those games, I essentially just sold it

131
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,120
again. But I regret that because those are really
fun games and I wish I could still play them. Well,

132
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:59,540
what is a PS5 running for these days? Let's see.
Alright, so basically anywhere from $550 to $750.

133
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:06,080
I'll get back to you on when I will pick that up.
Maybe next year, when the price comes down. But

134
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:15,240
speaking of superhero video games, that brings us
to our question of the week. Besides Batman,

135
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,300
Spider-Man, and Wolverine, which Marvel or DC
character do you most want to play as in a

October 4th. But that does it for all the news for

142
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:03,440
this episode, so let's go ahead and move into our
main event, a duel between the DC heroine of

143
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:24,320
Amethyst and Marvel's hero, Black Knight. Okay,
Amethyst versus Black Knight. As I mentioned

144
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,760
earlier, these are two fantasy characters with
Amethyst coming from Gemworld and Black Knight

145
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:38,100
being tied to Arthurian, Legend, and Avalon.
Yeah, they both wield magic swords, and that's

146
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:43,860
basically the full extent that I know of that ties
these two characters together. Because really, I

147
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:49,480
don't know much about Amethyst. Who does? She's a
pretty obscure character. She's kind of like one

148
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:55,060
of those characters that was like commandee or
warlord, just kind of offset in their own niche

149
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:01,400
fantasy world, largely separate from the other DC
characters. But she's cool. DC produced a series

150
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,400
of shorts with the character one time that I
thought was fantastic. I can't wait to see the

151
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:11,780
character in live action. I'm pretty confident
eventually we will. These shorts were animated?

152
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:17,680
Yes. Yeah, and it was very much based off of like a
Zelda type of video game. It was awesome. Are you

153
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,480
able to watch them on HBO Max or were they just on the
DC Universe app back when that was around? Yeah,

154
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,360
they were on the DC Universe app, but you can also
see them on YouTube now. Oh, cool. Interesting.

155
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,040
Okay. Well, the Black Knight never got his own
shorts, but he did show up in an episode of the

156
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,060
Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes cartoon, but
he didn't have a speaking appearance. Oh, he was

157
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:43,560
just like a background cameo? Yeah, basically.
Doesn't count. I really did like the casting of

158
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,600
Kate Harrington as Dane Whitman though. It's
going to go somewhere eventually and I can't wait

159
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,980
to see it. Yeah, seriously, get that guy his own
movie already. Seriously. What the fuck, Marvel?

160
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:57,320
What are you guys doing? I can get masses. Get your
shit together. Let's go to get into the dual

161
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,780
portion of this episode to explain the
methodology behind our duels. Let's go to our

162
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:07,560
sentient dual simulator Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K
tell our listeners how you go about determining a

163
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,640
winner in our dual matchups. Yes, of course, sir.
The way I determine a winner between the

164
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:18,100
contestants is by running 1000 Monte Carlo
simulations using the characters statistics. A

165
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:22,360
Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic model
used to determine outcomes through random

166
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:27,860
sampling. In this case, I randomize the
statistics along a normal distribution as a way to

167
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,540
simulate the many variables that can occur during
battle. The stat parameters are based on the

168
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:37,080
official Marvel power grid from which the DC
characters statistics are extrapolated.

169
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:42,600
Additional stat categories are included such as
range, damage potential, versatility and

170
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:48,100
perception in order to create a more detailed and
accurate simulation. The results of the 1000

171
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,620
simulations provide a percentage of wins for each
character. The contestant with the higher

172
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:58,160
percentage is declared the victor as they have a
higher probability to win any given battle. In an

173
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,580
equitable pairing, neither character should win
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have

174
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:08,460
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat
Superman, so the confidence rate of my method

175
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,500
falls in line with the precedents that have been
established in the source material. My

176
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,980
mathematical simulations are without
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole

177
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:23,560
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K.

178
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,040
Before we run the simulations, though, we'd like
to break down each character's histories and

179
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:33,440
abilities before improvising a scenario on how we
imagine one of the 1000 simulations would play out

180
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,600
B for B. And it is my turn to go first with the Marvel
character, so let me tell you all about the Black

181
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:45,460
Knight. Dane Whitman was born in Gloucester,
Massachusetts, to a wealthy family and grew up

182
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:51,040
studying physics, eventually earning a master's
degree and pursuing doctoral work. His life

183
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,500
changed when his uncle Nathan Garrett, a
super-criminal scientist who had assumed the

184
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,200
mantle of the villainous Black Knight, was
mortally wounded in a battle with Iron Man. On his

185
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:06,680
deathbed, Garrett confessed his crimes to Dane
and implored him to redeem the family legacy by

186
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:12,520
restoring honor to the mantle of the Black Knight.
Inheriting Garrett Castle in England, Dane

187
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:17,860
discovered there the Ebony Blade, a mystical
sword forged by the sorcerer Merlin as a dark

188
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:23,320
counterpart to Excalibur. It was passed down
through generations by their ancestor Sir Percy

189
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:29,440
of Scandia, the original Black Knight of King
Arthur's Camelot, whose spirit appeared to Dane

190
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,280
in a vision. He explained that the Ebony Blade
carried a blood curse, that every time it drew

191
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,580
blood, it would drive its wielder closer to
madness. Dane accepted the burden and claimed the

192
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:45,940
weapon as his own. Initially, Dane sought to
infiltrate his uncle's former allies, the

193
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:51,280
Masters of Evil, in order to bring the team down
from within. During this time, he encountered the

194
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:56,140
Avengers, but was mistaken for his uncle Garrett
and was attacked. After proving his true

195
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:01,380
intentions, he aided the Avengers, becoming a
trusted ally and later a full member of the team.

196
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,600
You can learn more about the Masters of Evil and
Avengers in their respective duels against the

197
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:10,660
Legion of Doom and the Justice League. Using his
scientific knowledge and engineering skills,

198
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,460
Dane created a genetically engineered winged
horse named Aragorn and designed advanced

199
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:21,380
weaponry, including a power lance. Though he
wielded the Ebony Blade, he was always wary of its

200
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,100
corrupting influence. Dane soon became
entangled in mystical adventures. Fighting

201
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:31,340
alongside the defenders, his spirit was drawn
back to the 12th century, where he inhabited the

202
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:37,220
body of his ancestor, Sir Eobar Garrington,
during the Crusades. There, he fought in years of

203
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:42,560
bloody warfare under the Ebony Blade's
influence, battling the Fomor, a monstrous race

204
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:47,960
from Irish mythology. During this time, Dane
allied with the time-displaced Avengers and the

205
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:53,820
Eternal Cersei. Eventually, a druid returned his
spirit to his own restored body in the modern era

206
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:59,540
and Dane resumed his role as Black Knight. The
sorcerer Merlin soon summoned him, charging him

207
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:05,200
and Captain Britain to battle the villain Mordred
and the demonic knight Necromon. Their campaign

208
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,400
saw Dane briefly wield Excalibur when the Ebony
Blade was destroyed and fight beside the

209
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,160
resurrected King Arthur. Though Camelot was
ultimately destroyed, the Ebony Blade was

210
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:21,040
reforged and returned to him and he went home with
his new winged steed named Valinor. You can learn

211
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:26,040
more about Captain Britain and his duel against
Uncle Sam. Back in modern times, Dane resumed

212
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,820
active duty with the Avengers. His tactical mind
and scientific expertise proved invaluable,

213
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:37,580
particularly when geniuses like Iron Man or Hank
Pym were absent. His life grew more complicated

214
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:43,460
when the Submariner used the Ebony Blade to kill
his monstrous wife Marina, reigniting the

215
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,600
blade's blood curse. Dane's body slowly began
transforming and eventually succumbed to the

216
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:54,240
curse completely. He was held at Garrett Castle by
his friend Victoria Bentley, who attempted a

217
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,640
restoration spell but instead summoned the
spirit of Cer Percy from the court of King Arthur

218
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:05,900
into Dane's body. Cer Percy had ventured in the
modern world for a time with a man named Sean Dolan

219
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:12,560
as his squire until the curse was lifted and Dane's
own body was restored. To avoid the Ebony Blade's

220
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:18,680
curse again, Dane engineered a weapon called the
Photon Sword that was essentially a lightsaber.

221
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,340
His squire, Sean Dolan, was corrupted by the Ebony
Blade and transformed into the villain

222
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:29,220
Bloodraith. In battle, Bloodraith accidentally
killed Victoria Bentley, devastating Dane.

223
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,520
Despite this tragedy, Dane continued his service
with the Avengers and eventually rose to become

224
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,600
the team's field leader under Black Widow. In his
personal life, he found himself caught in a love

225
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:45,140
triangle between the Eternal Cersei and the
Inhuman Princess Crystal, both of whom you can

226
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:49,960
learn more about in their respective duels
against Firestorm and Tempest. Though bound to

227
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,220
Cersei through a mystical bond meant to stabilize
her fraying mind, Dane's feelings for Crystal

228
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:00,740
complicated matters. The situation grew dire
when Proctor, an alternate reality version of

229
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:06,480
Dane, embittered by rejection from his world
Cersei, attacked. After Proctor's defeat,

230
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,600
Cersei exiled herself to another universe and
Dane chose to accompany her, leaving Crystal

231
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:17,460
behind. Dane and Cersei's exile took them across
realities, including to the Ultraverse, where

232
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:22,760
Dane briefly became leader of the hero team Ultra
Force. Returning to Earth after splitting from

233
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:28,840
Cersei, he joined the heroes for Hire Team
alongside Luke Cage and Iron Fist. Dane was chosen

234
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:34,400
by the Lady of the Lake as the pen dragon of his age,
receiving new mystical equipment including the

235
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,280
Sword of Light, Shield of Night, and a new winged
steed named Strider, who could achieve

236
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,180
supersonic speeds and travel through
environments like outer space or underwater.

237
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:49,080
Dane trained the Knights of Wondegor, a group of
warriors created by the High Evolutionary, and

238
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:54,560
briefly served with the British team Excalibur,
later converting Garrett Castle into a museum

239
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,980
chronicling the Black Knights lineage. During
the Skrull Invasion of Earth, Dane fought across

240
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:05,520
London with what he believed was the Ebony Blade,
later revealed to be a vampiric counterfeit

241
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:10,920
created by Dracula, whom you can learn more about
in his duel with Andrew Bennett. Eventually

242
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:17,860
reclaiming the real Ebony Blade from Wakanda,
Dane fought vampires in Britain alongside MI-13,

243
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:23,220
the UK's Paranormal Intelligence Division. The
Ebony Blade's curse weighed heavily on Dane, and

244
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:28,220
after nearly killing an opponent in a Berserk
rage, his deteriorating mental state led him to

245
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:34,680
flee through a rift to a chaotic realm that he took
over and transformed into new Avalon, serving as

246
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:40,340
its protector. In time, Dane returned to Earth,
fighting the evil organization Hydra with a team

247
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:45,940
of heroes called Euroforce, and aiding the
Avengers against cosmic threats like the Kotari.

248
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:50,860
When Null invaded Earth with his symbioted
hordes, Dane fought valiantly. However, Null

249
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:56,120
revealed that the Ebony Blade did not corrupt its
wielders, but instead fed upon their existing

250
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:01,980
darkness, drawing strength from their flaws.
This revelation forced Dane to confront his own

251
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:07,640
inner demons and accept responsibility for his
violent impulses. You can learn more about Null in

252
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:13,600
his duel with White Lantern. Amidst this turmoil,
Dane discovered he had a teenage daughter named

253
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:19,200
Jax, secretly born years earlier to his college
girlfriend. Around this time, the villain

254
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,980
Mordred sought the Ebony Relics, which were a set
of mystical items all forged from the same

255
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:31,500
meteorite that formed the Ebony Blade, including
the Ebony Dagger, Ebony Shield, and Ebony

256
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:37,620
Chalice, the three of which could join together to
form the Ebony Crown, a weapon of ultimate mystic

257
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:43,440
control. Dane pursued Mordred through the mystic
realm of Lysinae's discovering Merlin's secret

258
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,500
betrayal, that the sorcerer, long ago, had pitted
Arthur and Mordred against each other, knowing

259
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:56,240
Camilla would fall. Mordred attempted to forge
the Ebony Crown, killing Dane in the process. His

260
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,860
daughter Jax then claimed the Ebony Blade and
attempted to slay Mordred in a rage. However, Dane

261
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:07,980
was resurrected by the Ebony Crown, defeating
Mordred and reforging the Relic into the Ebon

262
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:42,450
Siege, a dark throne that projected vision for the
Abyss. Which makes him highly resistant to both

263
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:47,650
physical and mystical attacks. He has wielded a
variety of weapons over the years including the

264
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:52,610
Power Lance, the Photon Sword, and the Sword of
Light and the Shield of Night. But I'm going with

265
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:58,090
his classic weapon of the Ebony Blade, which can
cleave through any substance, even Iron Man's

266
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:03,570
armor, and can deflect or absorb even the most
powerful magic directed at it. It can be

267
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:08,830
telekinetically summoned to its wielder, and its
wielder can be injured, but not killed, as the

268
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:13,910
blade will resurrect them. The Ebony Blade is
cursed in that it craves blood and corrupts its

269
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:19,670
user to kill. If fully corrupted, the wielder
becomes a bloodraith, a dark being who feeds on

270
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:25,890
souls. Outside of his relics, the Black Knight is a
gifted physicist, biologist, and engineer. He's

271
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:31,310
an expert trained swordsman, is an expert in
medieval history, and has a familiarity of the

272
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:37,010
world of magic. And that's the Black Knight. What
was the name of his Pegasus again? He's had three

273
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:42,610
Pegasi. The first one was called Aragorn, the
second one was called Valinor, and the third one

274
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:48,310
was called Strider. So there were all references
to the Lord of the Rings, Middle Earth. Is he going

275
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:53,810
to have one of these horses in this speculation? I
don't know, do you want him to? He can. If Amethyst,

276
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:58,650
I guess, is going to have a horse, is she? I don't
know, do you want her to? She can. First of all,

277
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:04,170
Strider would absolutely murder Amethyst's
horse, and I don't know if I want to speculate on

278
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:09,050
horse violence. I'm sorry, Amethyst's horse
isn't even a horse, it's a unicorn. It's a

279
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:13,950
Pegacorn. It would straight up impale Black
Knight's horse. Alright, we'll include him in the

280
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:19,130
duel, but you know, we'll be gentle. We'll be
gentle. Says you. Let me get into Amethyst's

281
00:27:19,130 --> 00:28:10,410
backstory. Never suspecting her extraordinary
origins, but as her 13th birthday approached,

282
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:16,350
Citrina's spell began to weaken. On the night of
her birthday, Amy received a mysterious Amethyst

283
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:22,130
pendant, the key to her true destiny. Soon after a
creature from Gemworld breached the barrier

284
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:27,830
between worlds and abducted Amy, dragging her
through the portal to her birthplace. Crossing

285
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:33,430
into Gemworld caused her to age rapidly,
transforming from a young teenager into a grown

286
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:38,390
woman. Rescued by Citrina's agents and brought
before the witch mother herself, Amy finally

287
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:44,650
learned the truth of her lineage. She was Princess
Amethyst, heir to a fallen house and the only one

288
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:50,090
who could oppose Dark Opal's rule. With her
lineage revealed and Citrina's guidance, Amy

289
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:56,210
accepted her role as Princess Amethyst and began
to build a rebellion. She forged alliances with

290
00:28:56,210 --> 00:29:01,430
her remaining houses that had resisted Dark
Opal's control, including Turquoise and Topaz.

291
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:06,450
Though new to her powers, Amethyst quickly
mastered the use of crystal-based magic and

292
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:12,290
martial combat, wielding enchanted weapons and
artifacts tied to her gemstone heritage. She led

293
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:18,030
an uprising against Dark Opal's forces,
culminating in a siege of his fortress, where she

294
00:29:18,030 --> 00:29:23,870
faced him in battle and ultimately defeated and
killed him, restoring the freedom of Gemworld and

295
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:29,590
reclaiming her family's throne. Amy returned to
Earth after her victory, attempting to resume a

296
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:35,250
normal life, but her connection to Gemworld could
not be severed. Conflicts erupted once more among

297
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:41,070
the noble houses in her absence, and Amy returned
to Gemworld to stabilize the realm. As her

298
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:46,450
influence grew, she attracted the attention of
greater magical forces, including the Lords of

299
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:53,810
Chaos. Dr. Fate revealed to her that she was not
merely a noble but a lord of order, like her father,

300
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:59,650
a powerful being meant to preserve balance in the
multiverse. This made Amethyst unique among the

301
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:05,710
Lords of Order, as she had been born into a human
form and carried the dual identity of mortal and

302
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:12,090
cosmic being. You can learn more about Dr. Fate in
our Dr. Fate vs. Dr. Strange dual episode. She

303
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:16,690
continued to act as Gemworld's protector,
returning to Earth once again to help repel the

304
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:22,010
specter who had turned against magic. She stood
alongside Earth's mystics at the Rock of

305
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:27,930
Eternity, alongside the Lord of Order Naboo, who
was killed along with the wizard Shazam, making

306
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:33,950
Amy the only living Lord of Order to enter into the
10th Age of Magic that emerged following the

307
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:39,730
specter's defeat. Upon Amy's return to Gemworld,
she learned that Gemworld had fundamentally been

308
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:46,670
altered by the shift in magic. With Gemworld now
known as Xerox, the realm was engulfed in civil

309
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:52,970
war. Amethyst fought to preserve what remained of
her home, and when the magic wars devastated the

310
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:59,130
realm, she was seemingly destroyed along with it.
However she later emerged on Earth and served as

311
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:04,810
one of its protectors for a time. Following the
Flashpoint reset of continuity, Amy Winston's

312
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:10,610
history was reimagined. She lived on Earth with
her mother, Gracie Winston, a stern and reclusive

313
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:16,710
woman who trained Amy from a young age in martial
arts and swordsmanship without explanation. On

314
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:23,310
her 17th birthday, Gracie took Amy to a remote
hilltop and opened a magic portal, revealing the

315
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:30,570
truth. Amy was actually Amaya, Princess of House
Amethyst on Nila, the realm known to Earth as

316
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:36,810
Gemworld. She learned she was the daughter of Lady
Graciel of House Amethyst and Lord Virion of House

317
00:31:36,810 --> 00:31:42,770
Turquoise, the latter of whom sacrificed himself
to get Amy and her mom to Earth and away from the

318
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:48,630
murderous ambition of Graciel's twin sister,
Lady Mordriel. The noble houses of Nila were

319
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:54,990
locked in an uneasy balance of power, with House
Amethyst ruled by Amaya's aunt, Lady Mordriel.

320
00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:00,170
Graciel and Mordriel, twin sisters, shared the
power of their bloodline equally, but upon

321
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:06,590
Amaya's 17th birthday, the bloodline magic would
be split three ways unless one of them died. During

322
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:12,190
the ritual to awaken Amaya's bloodline power, she
was drawn into a mystical trial where her mother

323
00:32:12,190 --> 00:32:18,690
Graciel and her aunt Mordriel confronted her with
a shared telepathic vision. The ceremony forced

324
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:24,210
her to choose between the path of blood and the path
of heart. On the path of blood, she could seize

325
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:29,030
greater power by killing her mother, and on the
path of heart, she would share the inheritance

326
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:35,490
equally. Mordriel whispered for Amaya to strike,
urging her to embrace bloodshed and ambition.

327
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:40,930
Amaya engaged Graciel in combat within the trial,
but when the moment came to deliver the killing

328
00:32:40,930 --> 00:32:47,090
blow, she refused. Her choice aligned her with the
path of heart, and the magic of House Amethyst was

329
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:53,870
divided three ways, binding Amaya, Graciel, and
Mordriel together as co-heirs. Amaya's return to

330
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:59,650
Nila sparked fresh conflict. She allied with the
House of Citrine and began to master her magical

331
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:05,970
abilities. Ingvi, a noble from House Citrine,
became her political tutor and friend, helping

332
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:11,370
her navigate the intrigue of Gemworld. Amaya's
dual heritage, with blood from both House

333
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:17,690
Amethyst and House Turquoise, granted her unique
magical abilities. Amaya was also gifted a winged

334
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:24,010
horse named Epsilonus, a loyal companion that
carried her across Nila's skies and into battle.

335
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:29,750
Amaya's leadership expanded beyond Nila when a
dimensional breach connected Gemworld to Earth.

336
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:34,530
She joined Young Justice, helping the team
navigate her homeland and fight off magical

337
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:40,090
invaders. Her portal magic became essential in
transporting allies across realms, and later she

338
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:44,650
joined the Justice League Dark, standing
alongside Earth's most powerful mystics to repel

339
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:49,210
supernatural threats. You can learn more about
Young Justice and their team duel against Young

340
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:55,010
Avengers, and Justice League Dark in their duel
against the Midnight Suns. During her reign,

341
00:33:55,010 --> 00:34:00,090
Amaya faced Eclipse, who sought to dominate
Gemworld through the corrupted power of the Black

342
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:06,110
Diamond. Using the prime catalyst, the core
magical artifact of House Amethyst, Amaya

343
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:11,530
disrupted Eclipse's hold and prevented an
Eclipse-powered cataclysm. You can learn more

344
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:17,010
about Eclipse in our Eclipse vs. Malekith duel
episode. With Amaya having proven herself to be

345
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:22,650
the savior of Gemworld, Graciel and Mortariel
abdicated their rule, making Amaya the

346
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:29,250
undisputed ruler of House Amethyst. Her control
over her house's full power allowed her to repel

347
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:35,949
even cosmic threats, and under her leadership,
the 12 houses entered a fragile peace. That's

348
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:42,409
Amethyst's story so far. Powers-wise, Amethyst
wields a vast and diverse magical arsenal rooted

349
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:47,889
in her bloodline's connection to crystalline and
gemstone-based magic. She can generate and

350
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:53,730
manipulate crystal constructs, hard-light
weapons, and enchanted armor. Her command of

351
00:34:53,730 --> 00:34:58,650
lattice magic allows her to interact with
energies of other houses, using rubies for

352
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:05,150
healing, emeralds for plant growth, topaz for
illumination, and more. She can open dimensional

353
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:10,790
portals, project destructive energy bolts, move
objects telekinetically, and perform

354
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:16,630
reality-altering spells through crystal
energy. As a hybrid of House Amethyst and House

355
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:24,210
Turquoise, she is immune to illusion and can wield
mist silk, an enchanted, intangible fabric she

356
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:30,610
uses as a whip or lasso in combat. Her heritage also
grants resistance to magical corruption, and

357
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:36,770
enhances her agility, strength, and reflexes. A
trained warrior, as well as a sorceress, Amethyst

358
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:42,390
is skilled in swordsmanship, hand-to-hand
combat, and battlefield strategy. Now with full

359
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:47,670
command of her house's power, she stands among the
most formidable magic entities in DC's

360
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:58,270
multiverse. With a few other magical tricks.
Fantasy-based, and she can do a lot more. DC needs

361
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:02,990
to be more original. This is just fantasy Star
Sapphire where all the constructs look like

362
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:10,290
low-res polygons. I just said she could do so much
more. She has a few other tricks. We'll see how that

363
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:25,790
goes for her. Network rises above the rest.

00:36:55,290 --> 00:37:05,490
victorious. Visit dynamicpodcast.com where we
settle the debate and settle the score. Well, now

370
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:09,850
that we've got their histories and abilities out
of the way, let's speculate on how one of the 1,000

371
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:15,350
simulated matches will go. The winner is
determined by simulations, not the speculation,

372
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:21,710
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could play
out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?

373
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:26,330
Well, I should say there are no rules, other than
the characters have no prior knowledge of the

374
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:31,250
other going into the fight. All they are aware of
starting out is that the other character is a

375
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:35,630
threat that needs to be eliminated. For the
speculation, the contestants will begin

376
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:41,010
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript
environment that will have no bearing on the match

377
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:45,910
itself, as no environmental statistics are
considered in my simulations. The contestants

378
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:51,370
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright,
then let's get into it. Amethyst and Black Knight

379
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:59,190
meet on the battlefield. Who goes first? I say they
both actually start off atop their ringed steeds,

380
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:06,050
Strider, whatever the fuck his name is, and
Ipsilos. And so they'll take to the skies and

381
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:10,750
charge at each other, just like a midair joust
pointing their ebony blades and the sort of

382
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:15,970
amethyst at each other. But at the last second,
Amethyst is going to generate this long,

383
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:22,290
crystalline lance around her sword, extending
her reach and knocking Black Knight out of the air,

384
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:29,310
so he falls to the ground, probably dies. So she
turns her sword into a lance? Yes. I'm going to say

385
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:35,690
that he dodges it at the last second right before
they clash, because Black Knight's horse,

386
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:42,390
Strider, can go supersonic, right? So he just
rushes past her like a blur, and he slices her lance

387
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:49,230
right in half, and she and her horse, whatever the
fuck its name is, gets staggered from the sonic

388
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:55,950
boom that Black Knight and Strider just created.
Okay, well as Amethyst is regaining her bearings,

389
00:38:55,950 --> 00:39:01,430
she sees Black Knight behind her as he's flown past
her, and she's just going to generate a portal in

390
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:07,330
front of Ipsilos that opens above Black Knight's
flight path. So she's going to fly through that,

391
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:13,970
crashing into him from above, and sending him and
Strider just spiraling to the ground. I mean, if

392
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:19,630
she crashes into him, like Black Knight's pretty
armored, Strider is a tough as nails horse, like

393
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:25,150
crashing into them is just as likely to send
Amethyst spiraling to the ground too. Like that

394
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:29,730
wasn't smart. And actually as they're both
falling to the ground in their horses, Black

395
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:34,570
Knight's going to leap off of Strider over to
Amethyst's horse and just cut off one of its wings

396
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:40,790
with his ebony blade, and then kick her off of her
horse, and then he's going to get caught mid-air

397
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:47,190
right before he hits the ground by Strider, who
lands safely. Well that was messed up. So Amethyst

398
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:52,130
and her horse fall to her death. Well, I mean
Amethyst doesn't actually need Ipsilos to fly,

399
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:58,790
she could fly under her own power. So as she's
landing on the ground, she's going to send her mist

400
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:04,870
silk toward Black Knight, because she can control
it. It's like a scarf, a magic scarf, and it's going

401
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:10,050
to wrap around Strider's neck, choking him out.
And since it's intangible to Black Knight,

402
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:15,750
there's really nothing he could do about it.
Except the ebony blade can cut intangible things,

403
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:22,810
like you can cut vision when he goes intangible. So
like a fucking surgeon, Black Knight slides the

404
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:29,210
blade underneath this magic silk and cuts his
horse free, and then sends Strider away back to

405
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:34,410
Avalon. Okay, well while he's busy saving his
horse though, Amethyst is already on the

406
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:39,910
offensive, and she's hurling magical crystal
shards at Black Knight, which pierces armor,

407
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:46,290
tagging him in the back. I mean, can her weapons
even pierce elf-forged Lady of the Lake enchanted

408
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:50,790
armor? Of course! Don't answer that, it doesn't
even matter, because Dane's going to swing his

409
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:56,250
sword and just slice all of these shards out of the
air, and then he's going to blitz Amethyst, just

410
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:02,190
rushing toward her. Well I mean, he's going to run
straight into a magic energy bolt, then several of

411
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:08,810
them actually. Yeah, sorry, except the ebony
blade can absorb a magic energy too. So like, I feel

412
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:13,030
bad for you man, honestly, like the ebony blade is
just too bad ass for you it seems, because like as

413
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:17,570
the Black Knight continues running at her, he's
going to fire the magic energy stored up in the

414
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:24,610
sword right back at her, and she gets hit by it, and
at this point he reaches her, and he straight up

415
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:29,990
stabs her through the shoulder, disarming her,
and making her drop the Amethyst sword. No,

416
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:35,470
because she's already generated a shield, a
crystalline Amethyst shield by this point, in

417
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:42,250
preparation for his approach. So that's going to
protect her from his energy blast, and by the time

418
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:48,150
he rages her with his sword, you know, she'll parry
his lunge attack, and she's going to transform her

419
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:54,370
shield into a second sword, the crystalline one,
so now she's dual wielding like a bad ass, and with

420
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:59,830
the extra blade, she's going to slice off his left
arm at the shoulder, and she's like, now stand

421
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:09,450
aside, we're the adversary. We're the adversary,
what? Oh! Black Knight's like, tis but a scratch.

422
00:42:09,450 --> 00:42:15,610
Scratch his arms off! Notice that, like, he wears
enchanted pauldrons on his shoulders, that would

423
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:21,030
prevent his arm from getting cut off. So
literally, she just scratches his armor, tis but a

424
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:27,990
scratch, and he's going to respond to her attack by
slicing her purple gem sword into, and then he's

425
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:32,750
going to slash right across her forearm, which is
going to force her to drop her sword, and more

426
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:39,050
importantly than that, he draws blood. So now
Black Knight is bloodlusted due to the ebony

427
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:46,090
blade, and Amethyst is really fucked. Well if he's
bloodlusted, then he's not really in control, and

428
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:53,090
so he'll probably charge at her, at which point
both halves of her mist silk that was sliced into

429
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:59,530
are going to fly to him and wrap around his face and
neck, just blinding and choking him, and as he

430
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:05,450
struggles against that, Amethyst is going to
quickly conjure this giant purple crystal battle

431
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:14,650
axe that she's going to sword wielding arm, where
he's not armored. So she slices that arm right off

432
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:20,670
before spinning around and cleaving him in half at
the waist. So with him on the ground, she's able to

433
00:43:20,670 --> 00:43:26,850
pick up her sort of Amethyst back up, and on one
knee, she's like, we thank thee, Lord, that in thy

434
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:32,310
mercy. Yeah, and then she gets booted right in the
head by the Black Knight who, surprise, is not

435
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:37,450
dead. He's resurrected because the wielder of the
ebony blade cannot be killed. So she gets knocked

436
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:44,470
over, and he's like, I'm invincible. And then he
impales her right through the torso into the

437
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:49,970
ground, and wins this match. But also he's like
super bloodlusted by this point, and probably

438
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:54,950
close to succumbing to darkness and becoming a
bloodwraith, because he just spilled so much of

439
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:59,310
her blood. There's no way that Black Knight
survives being sliced in half, because like he

440
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:04,690
wasn't even wielding the ebony blade at the end,
because she sliced that sword-wielding arm off,

441
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:09,970
remember? I don't have to tell you, man, it's
magic, okay? The sword was still in his severed

442
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:16,710
hand, so he still got resurrected. That's just how
it works. The Black Knight always triumphs.

443
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:21,290
Hopefully our audience has seen Monty Python and
the Holy Grail. Oh my gosh, if they haven't, what

444
00:44:21,290 --> 00:44:25,330
are they doing with their lives? Stop listening to
this podcast, go watch that movie. But we'll go

445
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:30,970
ahead and leave our speculation there. Either
Amethyst kills the Black Knight by severing him in

446
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:37,370
half, and he doesn't get resurrected, or he does
get resurrected due to the ebony blade's magic and

447
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:41,290
then finishes her off by impaling. So let's go
ahead and find out which of these two scenarios

448
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:46,150
happens by inputting the stats, running the
simulations, and coming back with a winner. A.J

449
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:57,470
.9K? Hit it! All right, this was an interesting
matchup. Both of these characters have things

450
00:44:57,470 --> 00:45:03,370
going for them over the other, kind of going back
and forth. Like, Black Knight is more durable,

451
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:08,170
largely due to his enchanted armor, but also
because he can be considered regenerative

452
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:13,330
through the resurrection enchantment that his
sword grants him. Yeah, he was more durable than

453
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:19,150
her. He was also much more intelligent than her.
Considering Amethyst is really just a teenager.

454
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:24,370
Yeah, Dain is considered like the Avengers
resident scientist, like I said in his bio, when

455
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:30,350
people like Iron Man or Ant Man are away. That's so
weird to me. Like, why would a character like Black

456
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:35,930
Knight need to be a scientist? Why would he need to
be able to engineer his own horse? Because he was a

457
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:41,010
scientist who was really introduced to the world
of magic through the death of his uncle, and

458
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:46,790
learned about this, like, whole legacy of the
Black Knight. I listened to your backstory. I just

459
00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:51,370
think that's dumb. I don't know what to tell you,
man. You know, he made his own lightsaber, he makes

460
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:56,290
a lot of his own weapons. It's just part of the
character. Whatever. We did say that Amethyst was

461
00:45:56,290 --> 00:46:00,790
obviously more versatile than him, considering
not only can she create constructs, but is also

462
00:46:00,790 --> 00:46:06,870
just a sorceress in general. Yeah, her whole power
set is a little bit vague. Don't you think? Oh, I

463
00:46:06,870 --> 00:46:12,170
mean, no more vague than any sorcerer. Yeah,
that's lame. We also said that Amethyst has a

464
00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:18,050
greater range due to the fact that the Black Knight
can really only blast energy if he absorbs that

465
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:23,310
magic with his ebony blade, or if he's wielding a
different weapon such as the Sword of Light. But

466
00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:29,110
everything else was pretty close, I would say.
Well, we said Amethyst was faster because she can

467
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:35,490
fly and generate portals. I mean, the Black Knight
does have Strider, who can go supersonic speeds,

468
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:40,470
but he's not always mounted on Strider. So we just
gave a slight edge and speed to Amethyst. We also

469
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:46,190
gave her a slight edge and damage level as well,
again, because of magic, which is also why she got a

470
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:52,650
slight edge in perception because of her noble
blood, she's able to perceive things that other

471
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:59,070
people can't, including magical illusions she
sees right through them. That all said, Jonathan,

472
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:04,470
who's taking the win on this one? I'm going to say
Amethyst. I know you really like Black Knight. I

473
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:08,430
just don't think he has enough going for him in this
match. Well, that was dumb. That was a dumb thing to

474
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:16,270
say. Maybe, I mean, Instagram probably agrees
with you because 54% of them sided with Black

475
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:20,690
Knight to be the winner. But I feel like that's
probably just because Amethyst is a fairly

476
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:26,130
obscure character. Or maybe it's just because you
don't want to admit it to yourself. Let's find out.

477
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:34,030
AJ9K, the results, please. Here you are, sir. All
right, the winner between Amethyst and Black

478
00:47:34,030 --> 00:47:44,830
Knight is Amethyst. We'll call it a draw though,
right? We'll call it a draw. It depends on what the

479
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:52,630
percentage was. Out of 1000 simulated matches,
Amethyst won 674 of them compared to the Black

480
00:47:52,630 --> 00:48:02,350
Knight's 326 wins. So it was 67.4% over 32.6%. I'm
sorry, that is definitely not a draw. Amethyst

481
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:08,610
wins this hands down as she should because she's a
pretty powerful sorceress. I guess Black Knight

482
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:13,890
is kind of like the Avengers equivalent to
Wolverine in a sense, in that his primary power is

483
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:19,070
that he can cut through anything and kind of goes
into these berserker rages on occasion. If you

484
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:24,470
think about it, it does make sense that it wouldn't
hold up to someone as versatile as Amethyst. Maybe

485
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:29,990
I should have gone into this match with his sort of
knight in shield of light. Joseph, no one cares.

486
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:38,750
He's a loser. He lost. I have one thing to say to
Black Knight, none shall pass. Okay, Gandalf. Oh,

487
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:44,570
that was you shall not pass, right? Yeah. Okay.
Congrats to Amethyst. That does it for this duel.
