On with the show.

10
00:01:27,138 --> 00:01:31,740
duel Podcast, a weekly show where we review
superhero films and debate the superiority

11
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:37,344
between Marvel and DC by comparing their characters
in stat-based battle simulations. I'm Johnny

12
00:01:37,384 --> 00:01:43,027
DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous Joe.
And in this episode, we are reviewing season

13
00:01:43,207 --> 00:01:49,651
one of Agatha, All Along. It's Marvel Television's
latest Disney Plus exclusive series that I

14
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:55,434
did not think I was going to enjoy, but damn
did I. Yet. It was really good, I can't wait

15
00:01:55,454 --> 00:01:58,877
to talk about it later on this episode. Before
that, we're gonna break down the latest comic

16
00:01:58,897 --> 00:02:03,180
book movie news to come out this past week,
of which we have two new trailers coming out

17
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:08,784
of Brazil's D23, and that was the Captain America
Brave New World official trailer and the Thunderbolts

18
00:02:08,864 --> 00:02:14,868
D23 special look. So basically, this is an all
Marvel episode, this is in fact the third week

19
00:02:15,028 --> 00:02:21,573
in which there is no DC news. So Jonathan, tell
me, why are you still a DC fan? Not gonna lie,

20
00:02:21,613 --> 00:02:28,591
it's pretty hard right now. Um, after the Joker
just being so disappointed by that and not

21
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:35,498
really having too much to get excited for besides
Superman legacy. I need something. I need something.

22
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:40,083
Well, we are going to be reviewing the Penguin
next week. That's fair. People have said that's

23
00:02:40,123 --> 00:02:44,227
really good. I haven't even watched a single
episode of it, but I can't wait to. Now that

24
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:48,684
I finished Agatha all along, I could do that.

But with that out of the way, quick to the No
Prize! The No Prize is an award Marvel used

45
00:04:35,562 --> 00:04:40,506
to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic
Duel No Prize, is a digital award we post on

46
00:04:40,606 --> 00:04:45,289
Instagram for the person that we feel gave the
best answer to our question of the week. Last

47
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:50,432
week we asked you guys, out of Marvel Television's
upcoming projects revealed in the sizzle reel

48
00:04:50,552 --> 00:04:54,567
that was released a couple weeks ago, Which
one gets you the most excited and why? And

49
00:04:54,587 --> 00:05:00,491
this is coming off of the video that Marvel
put out that showed their 2025 Marvel television

50
00:05:00,671 --> 00:05:05,475
and Marvel animation projects. We got a total
of two answers for this. It looks like you

51
00:05:05,495 --> 00:05:10,178
guys are not very excited about what Marvel
television has to offer. I don't think that's

52
00:05:10,198 --> 00:05:15,062
the case. I think maybe it was just a boring
question because people will be like, I'm obviously

53
00:05:15,102 --> 00:05:20,085
excited for Daredevil. Like, obviously, like
next question. So that's probably our bad,

54
00:05:20,185 --> 00:05:26,066
but. We do have a no prize winner to announce.
We did get an answer from Mason Thompson, but

55
00:05:26,146 --> 00:05:32,811
it was not understandable due to the whispering,
bro. So if you call us, make sure that we can

56
00:05:32,912 --> 00:05:36,334
understand you if the whole thing's gonna be
whispering. You don't have to keep us a secret,

57
00:05:36,374 --> 00:05:41,278
it's fine, we're cool. Like people like us.
The winner of this week's no prize goes to

58
00:05:41,739 --> 00:05:47,764
CJ Craft, who said? Hey guys, CJ Craft here.
Out of all the shit Marvel listed, I think

59
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:52,157
my favorite piece of shit has to be- Yeah, damn,
see?

60
00:05:58,318 --> 00:06:03,127
a chance to introduce even new characters that
aren't in the comics that could become big

61
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:03,928
figures later.

62
00:06:06,978 --> 00:06:12,822
Sorry about the shit jokes. I left out loud
when I first listened to this message because

63
00:06:12,862 --> 00:06:16,185
I had forgotten that I was like, out of all
the shit that Marvel's putting out and you're

64
00:06:16,205 --> 00:06:23,331
like, you're right, it is shit. But no, Eyes
of Wakanda is something that we didn't really

65
00:06:23,451 --> 00:06:27,754
get a good look at until the sizzle reel came
out a couple of weeks ago that Marvel released.

66
00:06:28,295 --> 00:06:32,959
And we had commented that it looks very unlike
anything else that Marvel Studios has produced.

67
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:37,610
It doesn't look like, you know, the What If
series or X-Men 97. It almost looks like a

68
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,873
Clone Wars style cartoon with that type of 3D
character animation. It looks really fascinating,

69
00:06:42,913 --> 00:06:48,057
especially the content of the show, which is
going to give us a look at Black Panthers from

70
00:06:48,097 --> 00:06:54,080
the past. Basically exploring Wakanda's rich
history and mythology. Yeah, honestly, the

71
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:00,264
MCU I feel like has created a version of Wakanda
that is cooler than anything I've ever personally

72
00:07:00,324 --> 00:07:04,674
read in the comics. I'm not sure if you feel
the same way. But it'll be cool to see how

73
00:07:04,714 --> 00:07:09,595
that culture has evolved into what it is in
the movies today. Yeah, Ryan Coogler and Marvel

74
00:07:09,635 --> 00:07:14,757
Studios did such fantastic world building, both
in the original Black Panther film and its

75
00:07:14,797 --> 00:07:20,519
sequel, Wakanda Forever. So it's nice to be
able to consistently revisit it, you know,

76
00:07:20,699 --> 00:07:25,660
every few years. I think it's necessary just
as this piece of modern pop culture mythology.

77
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,581
It's unfortunate that the show is only going
to be four episodes, because I feel like we

78
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:33,304
could get a... a whole 10 episode series out
of that, but it's only going to be four episodes

79
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:36,687
and I'm sure they're going to be fantastic.
Do you think we'll get a chance to see more

80
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:41,691
of Namor? Ooh, that's a great question. I don't
know. I know that we're going to see Iron Fist.

81
00:07:42,091 --> 00:07:47,555
Not the Danny Rand version, but like a historical
version of the Kun Lun warrior. Oh man, please

82
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:51,819
tie that into Shang-Chi. In fact, if they want
to include the Mandarin in there somewhere,

83
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:56,350
that'd be cool too. I'm totally fine with that.
That would be totally awesome. The show comes

84
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,556
out on August 6th, so we have a ways to wait
before we see it, but yeah, totally excited

85
00:08:01,596 --> 00:08:06,401
for Eyes of Wakanda. So thanks CJ for calling
in with that answer, and congrats on winning

86
00:08:06,421 --> 00:08:10,225
this week's No Prize. If you the listener want
a shot at winning your own No Prize, stay tuned

87
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:14,630
to later on this episode when we'll be asking
another Question of the Week. And now that

88
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,512
that's done, on to the news!

89
00:08:21,974 --> 00:08:27,995
Alright, last week was the big D23 Brazil event,
which is a fan event held for fans down in

90
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:33,637
South America, and we got not only the official
trailer for Captain America Brave New World,

91
00:08:33,677 --> 00:08:38,338
but we also got like an extended scene and new
trailer for the Thunderbolts film which was

92
00:08:38,358 --> 00:08:43,379
called a D23 Brazil special look. They're both
on YouTube if you want to go check them out

93
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:47,381
because I'm excited to talk about them. First
off, the Captain America Brave New World trailer

94
00:08:47,641 --> 00:08:50,921
was really cool, not for necessarily what it
showed because I don't know if it showed it.

95
00:08:51,138 --> 00:08:56,200
too many new surprises compared to what the
teaser showed us. But I think stylistically,

96
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,363
this is one of the most interesting trailers
that Marvel has ever put out. It is very different

97
00:09:01,463 --> 00:09:05,886
from any other trailer that Marvel has ever
done. You're right. It took itself very, very

98
00:09:05,926 --> 00:09:11,169
seriously. Like there were no wisecracking jokes
here. There is barely even any music. And I

99
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:15,471
actually really liked that about this trailer.
Yeah, there were like a lot of ticking clocks

100
00:09:15,511 --> 00:09:19,762
and stuff like that. Just really ratcheting
up the tension. It is a tense trailer. I wonder

101
00:09:19,782 --> 00:09:24,344
if the movie is actually going to be as tense
as this preview is portraying it, but like

102
00:09:24,384 --> 00:09:28,665
we didn't get like the standard Marvel Studios
branding or anything. It was just white on

103
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:33,327
black titles, which I thought was an interesting
departure for any Marvel Studios film. They're

104
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:37,669
really trying to make it look like something
unique here, something more akin to, you know,

105
00:09:37,829 --> 00:09:42,631
the previous Captain America movies like Winter
Soldier and Civil War, but like ratcheted up

106
00:09:42,671 --> 00:09:48,213
to 11. Like, I feel like they're selling this
as the end-all-be-all political action thriller.

107
00:09:48,674 --> 00:09:52,536
Yeah, I noticed that about the branding as well.
It actually caught me off guard as I was watching

108
00:09:52,636 --> 00:09:58,279
the trailer. I was like, wait, that's not the
Marvel font. What's going on here? They did

109
00:09:58,299 --> 00:10:03,182
this, like interesting split screen effect for
most of the trailer. We were getting two simultaneous

110
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:07,164
shots on the left hand side of the screen and
the right hand side, which was an interesting

111
00:10:07,224 --> 00:10:13,988
way to kind of keep diverting your attention.
But it kind of gave me Hulk 2003 film vibes

112
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:18,687
for the split screen effect. But at least it
made sense here. the way they did it. It wasn't

113
00:10:18,727 --> 00:10:23,691
quite as clumsy as how that film did it back
in the day. Well, I love that movie, so I'm

114
00:10:23,711 --> 00:10:28,135
not complaining. I don't think that'll be in
this movie. I think that's way too far of a

115
00:10:28,155 --> 00:10:33,520
departure for Marvel's standard way of filming
things. But I think as far as a trailer goes,

116
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:38,244
it's pretty innovative. There were quite a few
major action shots that were shown here that

117
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:43,249
we haven't seen elsewhere. One of them was a
little bit weird because it was Sam Wilson's

118
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:48,040
Captain America. landing among a group of enemy
soldiers, like really, really fast, like fast

119
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,622
enough to break his legs. And then all of a
sudden, you know, the sonic boom from his landing

120
00:10:52,063 --> 00:10:57,346
knocks them all back. Now, I can understand
Sam flying fast enough to breach the sound

121
00:10:57,386 --> 00:11:01,129
barrier. But what I can't understand is him
basically crashing into the ground at that

122
00:11:01,189 --> 00:11:05,832
speed and just being fine with it in the same
way that Iron Man would. Iron Man, at least

123
00:11:05,852 --> 00:11:10,735
you can rationalize that his armor has some
kind of like inertial dampener to protect him.

124
00:11:11,216 --> 00:11:16,239
But it's hard to make that same rationalization
for Captain America who's not wearing the same

125
00:11:16,359 --> 00:11:19,901
armor. Right, yeah, he'd have to be wearing
like Vibranium boots or something like that,

126
00:11:19,921 --> 00:11:24,525
which isn't outside the realm of possibility.
I guess not, I mean, he does have Vibranium

127
00:11:24,585 --> 00:11:29,088
wings that were gifted to him by Wakanda, which
we saw in the Falcon and the Winter Soldier

128
00:11:29,128 --> 00:11:33,411
television series. So you're right, it might
not be out of the realm of possibility, it

129
00:11:33,451 --> 00:11:36,993
was kind of a badass line where he lands and
he looks at all the soldiers and he's like,

130
00:11:37,093 --> 00:11:41,857
wait for it, and then the Sonic Boom comes.
That was pretty cool. Sam does have some pretty

131
00:11:41,897 --> 00:11:46,363
fantastic moments here. Especially when we see
him in an aerial dogfight with a bunch of other

132
00:11:46,443 --> 00:11:50,406
airplanes who fire missiles at him And he takes
all the missiles out with his shield that was

133
00:11:50,446 --> 00:11:56,610
really badass and of course at the end of the
trailer we see him go up against Red Hulk and

134
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:03,234
Red Hulk freaking throws a flaming car at the
guy and Sam does a flip over it and slices

135
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:07,516
the car in half with his wings. I got chills.
That was awesome Yeah, I didn't realize his

136
00:12:07,576 --> 00:12:12,919
wings were that sharp, but sure Sam's so cool
with the wings, I think that's the main appeal

137
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,902
that I get from watching these trailers. I hope
that the story is as compelling as they're

138
00:12:17,922 --> 00:12:22,724
portraying it to be, but even if it doesn't
quite live up to my high expectations already,

139
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:28,527
I know at least we're gonna get some really
badass, quintessential, iconic Sam Wilson Captain

140
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:32,990
America action beats. The Captain America movies
have always been pretty good, so I'm not worried

141
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,392
at all. I think this is gonna be really good.
Well, we'll find out in just a few months.

142
00:12:36,452 --> 00:12:43,363
The movie comes out on February 14th, Valentine's
Day. So, yeah, take your significant other

143
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:48,586
to go see Captain America and have a good time.
Yeah, no one's going to do that. It's not a

144
00:12:48,626 --> 00:12:53,909
date movie. It's totally a date movie. Is it,
though? Every girl wants their guy to take

145
00:12:53,929 --> 00:13:00,773
them to a Marvel Studios film. Trust me, bro.
It's a sure thing if you do. No, it's the farthest

146
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:06,756
thing from that, actually. Like who's Sam's
love interest in this? At least I know, man.

147
00:13:06,956 --> 00:13:12,300
At least even Steve Rogers had a love interest.
Maybe it's the Sabra chick, the Israeli fighter

148
00:13:12,341 --> 00:13:17,106
that they kind of retconned into being a member
of the Red Room program in the film. Maybe,

149
00:13:17,126 --> 00:13:21,971
I don't know. Those two probably hook up in
the film, I bet you. Anyway, with that said,

150
00:13:22,011 --> 00:13:23,773
that brings us to our question of the week.

151
00:13:28,362 --> 00:13:33,546
What would you say is the best Marvel or DC
film to watch on Valentine's Day with your

152
00:13:33,566 --> 00:13:37,629
significant other and why? And I'm not talking
about like new releases that come out in the

153
00:13:37,669 --> 00:13:42,013
theaters. I'm talking about like you and your
SO are like sitting on the couch. You pop in

154
00:13:42,053 --> 00:13:47,457
a Marvel or DC movie on Valentine's Day. What
is it and why? Record your answer at dynamicduel.com

159
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:10,546
Be sure to answer before November 16th. Moving
on to the Thunderbolts D23 Brazil special look.

160
00:14:10,686 --> 00:14:15,688
This was such a badass preview for the Thunderbolts
movie. Just what I thought I couldn't be more

161
00:14:15,748 --> 00:14:22,306
excited for the movie. We get this extended
look at an action scene where The Thunderbolts

162
00:14:22,346 --> 00:14:27,629
are riding in Red Guardian's limo, escaping
from an armored convoy, and the Winter Soldier

163
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:33,032
shows up and basically just fucking annihilates
the entire convoy in spectacular style, straight

164
00:14:33,092 --> 00:14:38,015
out of like a Terminator movie. It is so damn
cool. Even Red Guardian himself is like, oh,

165
00:14:38,035 --> 00:14:42,457
it's the Winter Soldier. He's so cool. It looks
hilarious. It looks action packed. I loved

166
00:14:42,537 --> 00:14:46,440
everything about that scene. Yeah, I love how
the Red limo they were driving was like Red

167
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:51,822
Guardian's own personal, like Red Guardian mobile.
Yeah. I like how one of the defensive maneuver

168
00:14:51,862 --> 00:14:57,204
switches he clicked on was basically just like
mood lighting in the backseat with Genuine's

169
00:14:57,545 --> 00:15:01,286
My Pony playing. That was actually a pretty
good comedic beat. But there was some other

170
00:15:01,326 --> 00:15:07,029
great music in this trailer. We got Possum Kingdom
by the Toadies and that's following the previous

171
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:11,951
trailers whereas My Mind by the Pixies. So like
Thunderbolts is just firing on all cylinders

172
00:15:11,971 --> 00:15:15,952
when it comes to the music in these previews.
I mean, are you surprised? Because like the

173
00:15:15,992 --> 00:15:21,887
Suicide Squad films had amazing soundtracks.
What does the Suicide Squad have shit to do

174
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:27,030
with shit? Again, this is basically Marvel's
Suicide Squad, so I'm saying they're, you know,

175
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:32,193
trying to really live up to that. I think you're
just way off base here, and I think you need

176
00:15:32,213 --> 00:15:37,136
to shut your mouth about the Suicide Squad as
it pertains to the Thunderbolts. Okay? Oh,

177
00:15:37,156 --> 00:15:39,057
that's cute. You think you could tell me what
to do.

178
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,222
As Possum Kingdom is playing, we get some cool
beats, just basically showing the... quirky

179
00:15:47,282 --> 00:15:52,143
attitude of the Thunderbolts cast of characters.
I really like Yelena Belova. Like Florence

180
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:58,105
Pugh has really stood out as this truly hilarious
deadpan character out of the Black Widow film.

181
00:15:58,385 --> 00:16:03,606
Her Yelena is awesome. I just like how she could
tell a character like the Contessa to eat shit,

182
00:16:03,806 --> 00:16:08,808
you know? Just that delivery alone was perfection.
Yeah, her deliveries and David Harbour's line

183
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:14,249
deliveries as the Red Guardian, also like perfect
comedic timing. Actually, a lot of the cast

184
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:20,011
was pretty comedic, even John Walker. Which
was surprising. Yeah. I really love when Red

185
00:16:20,051 --> 00:16:24,293
Guardian asks Bucky, like, what kind of super
soldier serum he got. He was like, I don't

186
00:16:24,313 --> 00:16:32,036
know, the regular kind, the Hydra kind. And
he's like, ooh, Hydra. So fancy. So good. Another

187
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:38,519
great gag from the trailers is how they're underselling
the sentry by just calling him Bob and just

188
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:43,541
making him look like this regular guy who shows
up wearing scrubs. You know, it's just so unassuming.

189
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:50,172
And I hope it's a surprise for a lot of audiences
just how powerful he ends up being as the Sentry.

190
00:16:50,632 --> 00:16:54,614
I don't know why, but for the first time in
this trailer, I finally understood why people

191
00:16:54,654 --> 00:16:58,356
are saying that this is actually going to be
like the Avengers and that's the whole reason

192
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:03,238
for the asterisk. Because Yelena bought Avengers
Tower, so she's probably making her own Avengers

193
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:08,240
team. So while she dubs them the Avengers, you
know, Alexi is calling them something different.

194
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:13,407
Yeah, Red Guardian is calling them the Thunderbolts
and he thinks it's a really cool name. No one

195
00:17:13,427 --> 00:17:17,836
else thinks that though, which is also pretty
damn funny. Really can't wait for this movie.

196
00:17:17,896 --> 00:17:22,565
It comes out May 2nd, just a few months after
Captain America Brave New World.

197
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:33,254
That does it for all the Marvel shit from this
episode. Now let's go ahead and move on to

198
00:17:33,274 --> 00:17:39,322
the main event, I guess, which is more Marvel
shit. Our review of Marvel Television's Disney

199
00:17:39,342 --> 00:17:42,205
Plus exclusive series, Agatha, all along.

200
00:17:57,614 --> 00:18:02,999
Alright, Agatha All Along was created by Jack
Schafer, the same creator behind WandaVision.

201
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,727
The show serves as a direct sequel to that 2021
series and it stars Kathryn Hahn, Joe Locke,

202
00:18:09,907 --> 00:18:13,972
and Aubrey Plaza. It was released around the
Halloween season this year and I thought it

203
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:19,257
did a fantastic job continuing the spooky vibes
established in Marvel's other Halloween projects.

204
00:18:19,646 --> 00:18:24,128
like the Halloween episode of Wandavision, the
Werewolf by Night special presentation, and

205
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:29,750
the upcoming Marvel Zombie show set to release
around Halloween of 2025. Agatha all along

206
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:35,613
serves as a strong backstory for Agatha Harkness,
as well as a strong introduction for Wiccan,

207
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:41,435
aka Billy Maximoff, an original member of the
Young Avengers team. If you want to learn more

208
00:18:41,475 --> 00:18:46,197
about either Agatha or Wiccan, feel free to
listen to our duel episodes that feature those

209
00:18:46,237 --> 00:18:50,487
characters. It's not necessary to know the comics
backstories, but I do feel that you get more

210
00:18:50,547 --> 00:18:55,129
out of these shows and films when you see how
they compare to the source material. I will

211
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:59,831
say that Agatha all along has made the character
Agatha more prominent and interesting character

212
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:05,774
than she ever was in the comics. And I really
had a lot of fun with this series. I think

213
00:19:05,794 --> 00:19:10,255
it was an even better show than it needed to
be considering Agatha is a lesser character

214
00:19:10,296 --> 00:19:15,642
from the books. And there are some like truly
pause worthy twists in the show. in that the

215
00:19:15,662 --> 00:19:21,308
twist happens and you pause it and you're like,
what? And for those who haven't watched the

216
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:26,132
series, I got to say, don't spoil anything for
yourself by continuing to listen to the spoiler

217
00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:31,197
review. I recommend the show. Trust me, it's
worth watching if you're even the slightest

218
00:19:31,217 --> 00:19:36,242
bit interested in the MCU. So there's your spoiler
warning. Yeah, the thing I like most about

219
00:19:36,282 --> 00:19:41,178
this series actually is how unpredictable it
was like. The show just gets better and better

220
00:19:41,238 --> 00:19:45,200
as each episode progresses. And with all the
twists and turns that end up being revealed

221
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:50,522
toward the end, it actually gives a pretty solid
rewatchability factor. Yeah, yeah, the twists,

222
00:19:50,562 --> 00:19:54,784
man. I mean, like WandaVision had some great
twists, you know, like with the revelations

223
00:19:54,844 --> 00:20:00,027
of what was happening to Westview, who Agnes
was, things like that here. You know, there

224
00:20:00,047 --> 00:20:05,429
were great twists involving Billy and who he
was and what he could do with chaos magic,

225
00:20:05,449 --> 00:20:12,005
apparently. But. I think the best twist that
made my mouth hang open for a solid hour was

226
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:17,688
the revelation of what the Witch's Road actually
was. We spent this entire show thinking it

227
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:24,051
was one thing, only to realize that it was just
a song. Like a little children's song that

228
00:20:24,151 --> 00:20:29,354
Agatha's son would sing to pass the time as
they spent their lives as wanderers. It was

229
00:20:29,374 --> 00:20:36,058
like the most innocent, pure, simple thing that
in time became a legend. which in turn was

230
00:20:36,178 --> 00:20:41,440
used for something so sinister, which in turn
manifested into something so fantastic and

231
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:46,702
magical. I think the show's concept of the Witch's
Road is cool, you know, like manifesting the

232
00:20:46,722 --> 00:20:52,144
hero's journey as a sort of Wizard of Oz meets
Cabin in the Woods type setting, but the show's

233
00:20:52,344 --> 00:20:57,182
origin and evolution of the Witch's Road, I
think- It was pure brilliance. Oh, that was

234
00:20:57,442 --> 00:21:03,205
amazing. It was a fantastic reveal and it really
endeared me to the character of Agatha Harkness.

235
00:21:03,385 --> 00:21:08,467
Oh for sure, yeah. The twists though, they also
come with some caveats. I think some of this

236
00:21:08,607 --> 00:21:13,950
cleverness is also where the show stumbles.
Like the idea of the road complete with its

237
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:20,453
lethal trials requiring complex potion making,
spell casting, spiritual warfare, tarot reading,

238
00:21:20,953 --> 00:21:26,931
and botanomancy? You know, that's a solid concept,
right? They're all great challenges that require

239
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:32,734
skill and they have fatal consequences. So the
stakes are there. But the road reconceived

240
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:37,415
as an accidental manifestation of chaos magic
from a kid who's, you know, like a relative

241
00:21:37,455 --> 00:21:41,737
newcomer to the world of witchcraft. That's
a little bit harder to swallow. Like at one

242
00:21:41,757 --> 00:21:46,819
point, Jennifer Kale, the witch played by Sashir
Zamata, hallucinates that she's being drowned

243
00:21:46,879 --> 00:21:52,602
by a doctor she used to work with. And when
you look back on it, you're like, but. The

244
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:57,186
road isn't real, it's just Billy's manifestation.
So that's kind of weird what's going on there.

245
00:21:57,546 --> 00:22:03,151
Same thing goes for Alice seeing her mother
kill herself. And I don't think the drama surrounding

246
00:22:03,191 --> 00:22:07,355
the road would hold up to much scrutiny. Like
don't think about it too hard, otherwise you'll

247
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:13,821
be like, wait. And I'm pretty sure any question
regarding the road can be answered with, because

248
00:22:13,861 --> 00:22:18,705
it's magic, stupid. But I'm not positive the
show would do as well on a rewatch because

249
00:22:18,745 --> 00:22:23,127
of that. There's bound to be, I think, some
plot holes or more general weirdness derived

250
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:28,410
from some of these twists. I disagree. Because
of the revelation that the whole thing was

251
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:33,932
created by Wiccan, because he's psychic. He
could read people's minds. So it made sense

252
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:39,235
to me that the road was able to tap into that
to learn people's greatest fears. So you think

253
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:45,177
that somehow Billy's subconscious was able to
divine the correct manner of laying out a tarot

254
00:22:45,217 --> 00:22:50,349
deck? Well, I think his subconscious created
the entire thing. So absolutely. Sure. I mean,

255
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:55,234
yeah, again, I think that answer is in line
with because it's magic. Stupid. I think it's

256
00:22:55,274 --> 00:23:00,098
slightly better than that. Well, I'll have you
rewatch the show then and then see if there's

257
00:23:00,158 --> 00:23:04,101
any strangeness that comes out of the whole
concept there. You don't know my life. Maybe

258
00:23:04,181 --> 00:23:08,725
I will. Maybe I will rewatch it. Actually, I'm
going to watch the penguins. I'm not. I do

259
00:23:08,745 --> 00:23:13,149
plan on rewatching Agatha all along, probably
next Halloween season, because my wife really

260
00:23:13,189 --> 00:23:18,033
enjoyed it, too. I think one of the biggest
appeals for me was the impression that I got

261
00:23:18,073 --> 00:23:23,477
while watching it that everyone involved, from
the cast, to the writers, to the set designers,

262
00:23:23,597 --> 00:23:29,182
the wardrobe team, the musical team, they all
just had a blast making it. The project really

263
00:23:29,202 --> 00:23:34,006
seems like a director's dream, juggling these
multifaceted characters, putting them on a

264
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:38,950
roller coaster journey, transforming the look
of each trial with beautifully designed practical

265
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:44,490
sets and costumes and watching it all unfold.
The show is varied. in a way that few other

266
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:49,453
Marvel projects can be. And I found myself transported
in a way that can only really be described

267
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:54,857
as movie magic. Like forget that the show actually
dealt with fantasy magic. I'm talking about

268
00:23:54,897 --> 00:24:00,380
the transport of nature of well-made fun cinema.
Oh, this thing was unbelievably well-made.

269
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,064
The cinematography, fantastic. Like it was movie
quality. Yeah, especially when you're going

270
00:24:06,104 --> 00:24:11,072
from settings like the opening scene. that's
based off a crime drama. It felt like you were

271
00:24:11,092 --> 00:24:15,315
watching an episode of The Killing as they stumble
upon the body. And then, you know, you go to

272
00:24:15,655 --> 00:24:21,340
like the little big lies type setting of the
coastal home to the Friday the 13th style of

273
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,344
the cabin. I thought it was all fantastic. It
does feel like a dream project. Yeah, absolutely.

274
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:31,548
There were more amazing shots in this series
than there are in most Marvel movies, I would

275
00:24:31,588 --> 00:24:38,758
say. I agree with you, but also try to be respectful.
No, no, it will not be, I refuse. I have to

276
00:24:38,778 --> 00:24:43,239
imagine that the show creator Jack Schaeffer
was pleased with the end result of her vision,

277
00:24:43,639 --> 00:24:48,061
which I think was more successfully executed
here than in Wandavision, which I had some

278
00:24:48,161 --> 00:24:53,602
frustrations with if you remember from that
review. But Jack Schaeffer truly has a knack,

279
00:24:53,682 --> 00:24:59,924
I'll say, for writing series that aren't bound
to one style or genre. Like we saw in Wandavision,

280
00:24:59,964 --> 00:25:04,882
where many of those episodes recreated classic
sitcoms across the decades. And we saw it here

281
00:25:04,902 --> 00:25:09,464
with Agatha all along with things like the opening
scene, like I mentioned, or how the road would

282
00:25:09,504 --> 00:25:14,386
manifest each trial as a new setting. In another
comparison to WandaVision, Agatha all along,

283
00:25:14,426 --> 00:25:20,988
I think, also did a great job of balancing these
wide emotional turns, going from depressingly

284
00:25:21,048 --> 00:25:27,411
sad scenes of loss and grief to horrific and
unsettling moments to laugh out loud comedy.

285
00:25:27,851 --> 00:25:34,154
It was just well balanced all around. Oh, 100%.
Yeah, the story was just incredible. for this

286
00:25:34,194 --> 00:25:38,017
series. I really, really enjoyed the story.
I found it entertaining all the way through,

287
00:25:38,157 --> 00:25:46,283
particularly with the escape room type challenges
for each episode. That was so brilliant. Yeah,

288
00:25:46,404 --> 00:25:51,588
it was fun to try to figure out what clues there
were in the room and then seeing them solve

289
00:25:51,648 --> 00:25:56,952
it and what they got to do. They felt just right
in terms of difficulty level and the skill

290
00:25:56,972 --> 00:26:01,715
that it would take to actually pass the trial.
Yeah, and in regards to that, I also really

291
00:26:01,755 --> 00:26:07,039
liked the lore that they developed for witches
in this show. Like for there to be a protection

292
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:11,023
witch that, you know, is symbolized by fire
and a potion witch that symbolized by water,

293
00:26:11,663 --> 00:26:16,587
a divination witch that's symbolized by air
and a green witch that's symbolized by, you

294
00:26:16,607 --> 00:26:22,712
know, plants and stuff like that. Freaking is
this like Avatar? This is cool. What did you

295
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:26,910
think of the actual song, The Ballad of the
Witch's Road? It was cool. I liked the different

296
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:33,515
versions of it. It's catchy, as was Agatha Lalong
in WandaVision. Yeah, I got to say, even now,

297
00:26:33,655 --> 00:26:40,920
during this review in the back of my head, I'm
thinking down, down the road, down the way.

298
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,924
It's just on repeat in my head. It's an earworm.
I especially like the chant version, but, you

299
00:26:45,944 --> 00:26:50,107
know, the rocking out protection spell version
was also pretty good. That was pretty fucking

300
00:26:50,127 --> 00:26:54,746
cheesy. Not going to lie. But I don't like it.
It's fine. I liked it. I liked it because it

301
00:26:54,786 --> 00:26:59,229
was a spell that they were casting. It was a
song that served as a means of protection for

302
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:04,092
her daughter. I liked that other things were
going on as they were just really cheesing

303
00:27:04,152 --> 00:27:09,036
it up. You know, like that demon monster curse
thing that was terrifying. Yeah, that was pretty

304
00:27:09,056 --> 00:27:13,759
scary. And again, the lore behind that song
and how that developed, like who did you say

305
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:19,483
wrote this? Jack Schaeffer. This Jack Schaeffer
guy, he needs to do more Marvel stuff. Jack

306
00:27:19,503 --> 00:27:28,192
Schaeffer is a chick, bro. Jacqueline. Oh, shit.
But let's go ahead and talk about the characters

307
00:27:28,252 --> 00:27:33,076
that she developed for the show in our character
breakdown. Starting with Agatha Harkness, played

308
00:27:33,116 --> 00:27:38,661
by Catherine Han. On the very first episode,
I wasn't quite sure if Catherine Han was phoning

309
00:27:38,801 --> 00:27:43,605
in a weak performance, or if she was a good
enough actress to act like she was phoning

310
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:47,248
in a weak performance. And luckily, right when
she broke out of her spell by the end of the

311
00:27:47,268 --> 00:27:53,040
episode, I realized it was the latter. She was
fantastic in the show and as Agatha, I think

312
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:57,904
she's been able to really showcase the full
range of her acting prowess in tackling drama,

313
00:27:58,264 --> 00:28:03,788
comedy, horror, action, like in her opening
fight against Rio. And she can go from scenery

314
00:28:03,828 --> 00:28:10,133
chewing rage to the subtleness, sadness in her
eyes, to hysterical laughter. It's really a

315
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:14,976
beast of a role that I think any actress would
cherish and I think Han nailed it in a way

316
00:28:15,317 --> 00:28:19,915
that few other actors could. I will admit I
did not actually care for her performance for

317
00:28:19,936 --> 00:28:25,860
a majority of the series. I thought she was
like hamming it up way more than any of the

318
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:31,964
other actors were. But in hindsight, that may
just be because she was aware of more of what

319
00:28:32,004 --> 00:28:36,967
was going on than other actors were. So she
was trying to play along with them as it were.

320
00:28:37,447 --> 00:28:42,771
Yeah, totally. From the get-go, she realized
that this was a sham manifestation basically.

321
00:28:42,911 --> 00:28:47,770
So I think all of the information definitely
informed her performance. I am convinced that

322
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:51,954
she's going to get Emmy nominated again for
this role just like she did in Wandavision.

323
00:28:52,654 --> 00:28:58,079
I would not be surprised if that happened. Agatha's
journey in this show was mostly about her acquisition

324
00:28:58,099 --> 00:29:03,123
of power as it has been for centuries. You know,
she started out in the 17th century as a young

325
00:29:03,183 --> 00:29:08,348
witch studying black magic for which her mom's
coven tried to kill her. And she went down

326
00:29:08,388 --> 00:29:14,393
this really dark path, even apparently communing
with the entity of death, which seems pretty

327
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:19,316
damn dark. But her emotional arc really began
with the birth and death of her son Nicholas,

328
00:29:19,656 --> 00:29:24,079
who awakened this caring side of Agatha that
she had never really experienced before, a

329
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:30,544
side that was just utterly decimated when her
son passed away tragically by her side. From

330
00:29:30,624 --> 00:29:36,988
there, we saw her choose to live only for herself,
reverting to her main aim of amassing power

331
00:29:37,088 --> 00:29:42,472
and studying dark magic. She even acquired the
Darkhold we know at some point, and she was

332
00:29:42,492 --> 00:29:49,495
a good villain in WandaVision, interesting protagonist
here in that once again we get to see her open

333
00:29:49,715 --> 00:29:55,316
up a bit again when she encounters Billy Maximoff
who reminds her of and she perhaps initially

334
00:29:55,356 --> 00:30:00,758
believes to be her son Nicholas. You know, it's
a very vulnerable time for her not just emotionally

335
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:05,619
but also physically because she's powerless
and she has enemies that are coming for her.

336
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:10,280
So the audience connects with her in that regard
but she also shatters that connection with

337
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,601
her callous disregard for the

338
00:30:14,678 --> 00:30:21,300
Whereas the viewer you're equal parts interested
and repulsed and amused by and feel sorry for

339
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:27,043
her throughout the course of the show. But in
the very end, she finally settles into the

340
00:30:27,143 --> 00:30:32,845
mentor role that she's always served in the
comics. And I think it was such a fun and fascinating

341
00:30:32,885 --> 00:30:38,788
journey to see her get to that point, being
the mentor. Absolutely. Like I said earlier,

342
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:43,522
I didn't really care for the character of Agatha
until the final episode. when we learned about

343
00:30:43,562 --> 00:30:49,524
her past and saw what she has become. It was
a fantastic character arc. I actually really,

344
00:30:49,564 --> 00:30:54,847
really like her arc. But I also think that because
of the nature of her character throughout the

345
00:30:54,907 --> 00:31:00,529
series, Catherine Hunn was really fortunate
to have a strong supporting cast to really

346
00:31:00,589 --> 00:31:04,511
pick up the slack where the story didn't need
the character. Yeah, it was a great ensemble

347
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:09,393
cast, fantastic. One of the best ensemble casts
I think you can get for a series about a coven

348
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:15,393
of witches, honestly. But also great in the
cast was Wiccan, aka Billy Maximoff played

349
00:31:15,453 --> 00:31:20,096
by Joe Locke. I knew nothing of Joe Locke before
the show. I had heard good things about him

350
00:31:20,116 --> 00:31:24,099
from the Netflix show Heartstopper, and I got
the impression a lot of people were happy with

351
00:31:24,139 --> 00:31:31,064
his casting as Billy Maximoff. But I remember
not being that happy. Like in a very shallow

352
00:31:31,204 --> 00:31:35,467
manner, I'm ashamed to admit. I thought he didn't
look anything like the child actor who played

353
00:31:35,507 --> 00:31:39,994
him in WandaVision and Doctor Strange and the
Multiverse of Madness. I feel like such a fucking

354
00:31:40,094 --> 00:31:44,257
asshole now, not only because Joe Locke is a
wonderfully charismatic actor who I thought

355
00:31:44,337 --> 00:31:49,661
did an exceptional job in the role, but also
because the show itself did such an incredible

356
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:55,765
job in rationalizing how Billy came back and
why he looks different now. Oh, yeah, absolutely.

357
00:31:56,045 --> 00:32:00,849
I love the way they rationalized how Billy came
to be this William guy, because it's really

358
00:32:00,889 --> 00:32:04,791
confusing in the comics, I feel like. And it's
still a little complex here, but I think a

359
00:32:04,811 --> 00:32:10,159
little bit less confusing. Yeah, in the comics,
basically. Billy and Tommy were manifestations

360
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:15,982
of magic that ended up being shards of Mephisto,
the devil's soul. And when he pulled them back

361
00:32:16,022 --> 00:32:19,824
into himself, you know, they ended up dying,
but they got reincarnated, you know, years

362
00:32:19,884 --> 00:32:24,507
later and raised by different families. Here
is a little bit more interesting in that the

363
00:32:24,547 --> 00:32:29,729
reincarnation happens to William Kaplan the
moment he dies. Stan And he dies the same moment

364
00:32:29,769 --> 00:32:34,652
that Billy essentially dies. Ben Right, exactly.
Really well done. I think a lot of fans of

365
00:32:34,672 --> 00:32:38,834
the Wiccan character will be pleased with how
this all panned out. I'll say in regards to

366
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:43,157
my initial reactions to his casting, I don't
think that the marketing of Agatha all along

367
00:32:43,298 --> 00:32:48,762
did Joe Locke any favors, but I am happy to
say that I would be thrilled to see more Wiccan

368
00:32:48,862 --> 00:32:55,266
in the MCU, hopefully in an upcoming Young Avengers
film or series. Oh yeah, I would agree with

369
00:32:55,286 --> 00:32:59,009
the marketing for the show. I definitely felt
like it was outside my demographic. I was not

370
00:32:59,049 --> 00:33:03,893
looking forward to watching or reviewing the
show, I would say, but I'm really glad I did.

371
00:33:04,253 --> 00:33:10,123
Because honestly... I liked it more than WandaVision.
I liked it more than a lot of other MCU shows.

372
00:33:10,643 --> 00:33:15,624
Yeah, I think I liked it about as much as Loki
season two. I think I liked it more than that.

373
00:33:16,044 --> 00:33:21,666
Really? Oh, that's surprising actually. Yeah.
Back to Wiccan, his arc here had almost as

374
00:33:21,706 --> 00:33:26,407
many twists and turns as Agatha's did. First
he's William Kaplan celebrating his Bar Mitzvah,

375
00:33:26,447 --> 00:33:32,289
then he dies, coming back as Billy, but he's
amnesiac. We see his journey to Agatha, his

376
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:37,175
unconscious use of chaos magic to create the
Witch's Road. all to reach out and find his

377
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:42,960
twin brother Tommy, which I thought was a really
touching journey for him. And I'd like to think,

378
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,225
Jonathan, that if we both died and you reincarnated
that you'd risk your life to find and reincarnate

379
00:33:49,365 --> 00:33:56,931
my soul too, right? Right? I mean, I think I
would move on eventually. You piece of shit.

380
00:33:58,433 --> 00:34:04,197
Consider your ass haunted. Nah, okay, fine with
that actually. We'll be like brother voodoo.

381
00:34:04,746 --> 00:34:10,069
Yeah, that'd be cool actually. That'd be cool.
But thematically, yeah, Billy's arc was about

382
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:14,711
self-discovery and reunion. I think the story
hit those themes spot on. I thought he showed

383
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:20,314
true marks at the end of being a hero in his
bravery, in the face of adversity, his willingness

384
00:34:20,334 --> 00:34:25,938
to sacrifice, his remorse over his perceived
moral failures, his loyalty to his companions.

385
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:30,940
He's a fantastic new addition to the MCU. And
maybe him and his brother Speed will show up

386
00:34:30,981 --> 00:34:36,712
in Vision Quest. Who knows? I'm really hoping
they do Tommy as much justice as they did Billy

387
00:34:36,732 --> 00:34:43,436
for this series. Let's talk about death, aka
Rio played by Aubrey Plaza. Now, Aubrey Plaza

388
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:49,920
is a captivating and really talented actress.
But I'm not entirely sure she even did any

389
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:54,122
acting here. I think legitimately she just stumbled
on the set a few times, interacted with the

390
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:58,485
other performers, just being her normal, regular
self, shepherding the dead into the afterlife

391
00:34:58,505 --> 00:35:03,934
like she do, you know? That is Aubrey Plaza,
right? That's her in a nutshell. Like how can

392
00:35:03,954 --> 00:35:09,036
you get better casting for the character of
death than Aubrey Plaza? She's so deadpan,

393
00:35:09,556 --> 00:35:15,018
so mysterious, and yeah, she's kind of been
typecast as the sarcastic dry persona, but

394
00:35:15,038 --> 00:35:19,399
I think it really works well here. Like if you've
ever seen her chameleon-esque portrayal as

395
00:35:19,459 --> 00:35:24,560
Lenny Busker in Legion, or her heavily dramatic
side in Emily the Criminal, or her nuanced

396
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:29,934
role in Ingrid Goes West, you know the girl
can act. She has range. But with Death, it

397
00:35:29,954 --> 00:35:33,756
seems more like she was having fun here, you
know, getting to try some action heavy stuff

398
00:35:33,776 --> 00:35:38,359
in the first episode, and, you know, getting
to play a witch and the character of Death.

399
00:35:38,419 --> 00:35:43,442
Yeah, I didn't know what was going on with her
character, but when the reveal came that she

400
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:48,805
was Marvel's Death, that was one of those moments
where I had to pause it and just be like, holy

401
00:35:48,925 --> 00:35:54,388
shit! My wife was like, what? What's the big
deal? I was like, this is Death. Like, this

402
00:35:54,468 --> 00:36:00,223
is the Death that Thanos loved. in Marvel Comics
and he worshipped. The fact that they changed

403
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:05,826
it so that it was a relationship with Agatha
kind of levels up Agatha in my book. That's

404
00:36:05,866 --> 00:36:10,748
true. Yeah, they took the death persona, who
historically has been romantically linked to

405
00:36:10,868 --> 00:36:15,571
Thanos in the comics. Although, you know, that
romance is unrequited and they shifted it to

406
00:36:15,671 --> 00:36:21,906
Agatha, who is a dark magic witch. And conceptually,
I actually kind of like that more. Like death

407
00:36:21,966 --> 00:36:26,989
as a personification seems more at home in the
realm of fantasy magic more than, you know,

408
00:36:27,009 --> 00:36:33,332
the sci-fi bent of Thanos's cosmic stories.
Yeah, 100% I agree. How weird though would

409
00:36:33,372 --> 00:36:38,856
it be if Aubrey Plaza's death character fell
in love with Deadpool? Because that happened

410
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:44,019
in the comics. That was kind of like a gag in
the Deadpool books where death fell in love

411
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:49,121
with Deadpool because he's like this unattainable
figure for her because he can't die, right?

412
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:53,732
And so like Thanos beats the shit out of Deadpool
and they kind of like compete for her love.

413
00:36:54,132 --> 00:37:00,475
Could you see Aubrey Plaza vying for Ryan Reynolds
Deadpool in a future Marvel project? 100 percent.

414
00:37:00,555 --> 00:37:04,897
I don't even know how that's a question. Absolutely.
They should put out like a Valentine's Day

415
00:37:04,917 --> 00:37:11,280
special with those characters. That'd be hilarious.
I also got to say, I love how they leaned into

416
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:17,355
Aubrey Plaza's Hispanic heritage by portraying.
Death's true form with this Dia de los Muertos

417
00:37:17,395 --> 00:37:22,537
style design, those elements I think really
brought an interesting take to the more basic

418
00:37:22,637 --> 00:37:27,439
skeleton in a robe look that Death has in the
comics. Yeah, it's like La Catrina without

419
00:37:27,459 --> 00:37:33,222
the giant hat. Yeah, exactly. So cool. The whole
show is pretty diverse, right? I actually like

420
00:37:33,242 --> 00:37:38,464
that about it. Yeah, including Jennifer Cale
played by Sashir Zamata. I've been a fan of

421
00:37:38,504 --> 00:37:43,618
Sashir's from her days at Saturday Night Live.
She's a stand-up comedian. So I initially thought

422
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:48,681
that Jennifer Cale was gonna be like hilarious
in this show. She wasn't, but I'll say that

423
00:37:48,761 --> 00:37:55,084
I was impressed with Sashir's capacity for dramatic
acting, like able to convey horror, anger,

424
00:37:55,204 --> 00:38:01,448
sadness, all with authenticity. Jennifer Cale
in the comics is a sorceress who is part of

425
00:38:01,488 --> 00:38:07,291
the Cale family whose line was cursed with harboring
the spirit of vengeance. So Jennifer's aunt

426
00:38:07,531 --> 00:38:13,855
is Naomi Cale, who married Barton Blaze and
had Johnny Blaze. who would later become Ghost

427
00:38:13,895 --> 00:38:19,899
Rider. So Jennifer Kale is Ghost Rider's first
cousin and in the books is a powerful witch

428
00:38:19,959 --> 00:38:25,503
in her own right, primarily known for her adventures
with Man-Thing and Jennifer Kale has actually

429
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:30,387
even been a member of the Midnight Suns. That's
really cool to hear. I was wondering how many

430
00:38:30,427 --> 00:38:36,031
of these characters were actually from the comics.
And I'm glad it wasn't just- All of them. Oh,

431
00:38:36,051 --> 00:38:42,444
all of them? All of them. Bad ass. Including
the Wu. aka Alice Wu Gulliver played by Ali

432
00:38:42,604 --> 00:38:48,107
An. Now, I've never seen Ali perform before,
but I liked her in the show. Like Jennifer

433
00:38:48,127 --> 00:38:53,691
Kail, her character is a hero in the comics
called The Wu, who is a supernatural police

434
00:38:53,731 --> 00:39:00,376
detective in China. She's the daughter of the
former supernatural hero called August Wu of

435
00:39:00,396 --> 00:39:04,499
the Coral Shore. And I thought it was pretty
interesting here how they turned the mom's

436
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:08,910
superhero name into the name of her band. The
band was called Coral Shore. I thought that

437
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:14,092
was a neat Easter egg. But I am really bummed
that they killed Alice off so quickly because

438
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:19,714
she is a neat character. In the books, she inherited
some of her mom's magic which gave her this

439
00:39:19,834 --> 00:39:27,217
red streak in her hair. But she uses her magic
more indirectly. She imbued her regular police

440
00:39:27,257 --> 00:39:31,579
gun with supernatural abilities. And I think
there was a lot of potential there for the

441
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:36,761
character to maybe not headline her own show,
but maybe show up in future Marvel projects

442
00:39:36,981 --> 00:39:40,952
as a police officer. We never know. Maybe she
could come back as a ghost or something like

443
00:39:41,012 --> 00:39:45,035
that. I do have to say I love the fact that
they're bringing in these obscure characters

444
00:39:45,055 --> 00:39:49,439
because they didn't need to. But it just shows
that the showrunners are fans of the source

445
00:39:49,479 --> 00:39:53,542
material. Well, I mean, there's certainly interpretations
of the characters from the comics, right? But

446
00:39:53,582 --> 00:39:59,547
yeah, at least they're pulling inspirations
from the books. You love to see it. Yeah. Including

447
00:39:59,847 --> 00:40:05,992
Lillia Calderu, who's played by Patty fucking
Lepone. How the hell did the casting director

448
00:40:06,152 --> 00:40:12,528
land Patty Lepone for this show? No idea who
she is. She is a massively renowned Broadway

449
00:40:12,628 --> 00:40:18,671
star. Fantine in Les Mis. She was the Evita.
She was Mrs. Lovett in Sweeney Todd, Norma

450
00:40:18,691 --> 00:40:23,773
DeMond in Sunset Boulevard, Joanne in Company.
She's probably one of the most celebrated theater

451
00:40:23,833 --> 00:40:29,056
actresses of all time. And the fact that she
was cast in this was actually a big deal in

452
00:40:29,096 --> 00:40:33,706
those theater circles. Like my wife lost her
shit when she realized it was her. And I imagine

453
00:40:33,846 --> 00:40:38,610
it's kind of the equivalent of like when Marlon
Brando joined Superman or when Ian McKellen

454
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:44,415
became Magneto. It was just kind of surprising
and cool that these renowned actors are not

455
00:40:44,435 --> 00:40:48,719
like slumming it in the genre, but like they're
down to do this more fantasy adventure geek

456
00:40:48,759 --> 00:40:54,003
level stuff. I think it adds legitimacy to superhero
projects. She was probably one of my favorite

457
00:40:54,023 --> 00:40:57,987
characters. So I'm glad to hear that she has
like a fan base behind her. That's incredible.

458
00:40:58,327 --> 00:41:04,031
Yeah, she portrayed the character magnificently
in the comics. Lilia Calderou is related to

459
00:41:04,151 --> 00:41:09,555
Baron Mordo, the Doctor Strange villain. She's
actually his niece, and they're both descendants

460
00:41:09,775 --> 00:41:15,479
of Cogliostro. Lilia is the witch queen of the
gypsies. She's a very minor character, I'll

461
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:20,242
say, probably the most minor out of all these
comic book characters. I think that they probably

462
00:41:20,262 --> 00:41:23,965
should have gone with a more prominent witch
from the comics, like Topaz or something like

463
00:41:23,985 --> 00:41:28,128
that. I think Patti LuPone could have done well
as that character as well. I'm not complaining.

464
00:41:28,148 --> 00:41:32,702
I thought she did a fantastic job. Are you jealous
that- Marvel was able to land such awesome

465
00:41:32,742 --> 00:41:36,884
casting for their projects, whereas like DC
scrapes the bottom of the barrel most times.

466
00:41:37,264 --> 00:41:43,546
The fuck are you talking about? You just mentioned
Marlon Brando. How many Marvel projects has

467
00:41:43,606 --> 00:41:49,328
Marlon Brando worked on? That was in the 1970s,
man. Oh, I'm sorry. And? It was a long time

468
00:41:49,348 --> 00:41:52,429
ago. And? I'm talking about now. Who cares?

476
00:42:47,379 --> 00:42:52,482
Let's go ahead and move into our episode highlights.
Episode 1 was called Seekest Thou the Road.

477
00:42:52,923 --> 00:42:57,646
Still stuck in the spell that the Scarlet Witch
cast on her at the end of WandaVision, Agatha

478
00:42:57,686 --> 00:43:02,350
Harkness sees herself as a police detective
in a television crime drama called Agnes of

479
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:08,114
Westview where she investigates the murder of
a Jane Doe. She's visited by Rio Vidal, whom

480
00:43:08,194 --> 00:43:13,486
Agatha sees as an FBI agent inquiring about
the case and her true identity. After chasing

481
00:43:13,506 --> 00:43:18,250
and apprehending a teenage thief who broke into
her home, Agatha's false reality falls apart.

482
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:23,354
The spell breaks as Agatha realizes that Jane
Doe is the deceased body of the Scarlet Witch.

483
00:43:23,855 --> 00:43:28,618
Coming to in her home, Agatha finds herself
powerless. Formerly protected from her enemies

484
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:33,683
through her possession of the Darkhold, Agatha
is attacked by Rio. She successfully bargains

485
00:43:33,723 --> 00:43:38,387
to halt the conflict until she gets her powers
back and discovers the bound and gagged teen

486
00:43:38,427 --> 00:43:47,724
thief in her closet. the crime drama on, I think
it was AMC that was inspired by a Danish television

487
00:43:47,785 --> 00:43:53,027
crime drama. I saw like the final episode of
it. Oh, why would you do that? I don't know.

488
00:43:53,207 --> 00:43:57,810
It was on. I was waiting for The Walking Dead.
Oh man, it was such a good show. And there

489
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:02,032
was such a great twist at the end of that episode
where the mystery is finally solved. Fantastic

490
00:44:02,052 --> 00:44:05,334
show. If you haven't seen it, you got to watch
it. It's one of television's best crime dramas

491
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:11,757
ever. And I loved how they really weren't subtle
about their homage to that show in particular.

492
00:44:11,978 --> 00:44:16,540
with the opening scene of episode one here.
Yeah, it was all right. I have to imagine that

493
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,501
upon rewatching it, the whole thing becomes
a lot more humorous because you just have to

494
00:44:20,561 --> 00:44:26,044
imagine what was really going on outside of
Agatha's head as she was talking with everyone.

495
00:44:26,844 --> 00:44:31,326
I love that twist that they did later on when
they showed how Billy was actually interacting

496
00:44:31,346 --> 00:44:35,008
with her during the whole interrogation room
scene and stuff like that. That was great.

497
00:44:35,468 --> 00:44:40,022
Yeah, I like the moment in the second episode
where she was like, let's get in the car. and

498
00:44:40,062 --> 00:44:44,644
her car turns out to be like this makeshift
thing in her living room. Just imagining her

499
00:44:44,884 --> 00:44:50,266
walking around all day doing that kind of stuff
is just hilarious. Yeah, yeah. Episode 2 is

500
00:44:50,286 --> 00:44:56,749
called Circle Sown with Fate, Unlock Thy Hidden
Gate. The teenager reveals he freed Agatha

501
00:44:56,769 --> 00:45:01,391
from the Scarlet Witch's spell and begs her
to take him to the Witch's Road, a legend that

502
00:45:01,431 --> 00:45:06,533
allegedly grants its travelers what they desire
most. Agatha agrees to the idea in order to

503
00:45:06,573 --> 00:45:11,479
get her powers back, and learns that the teen's
identity is hidden from witches through a sigil.

504
00:45:11,899 --> 00:45:16,241
Needing a coven for the journey, she and teen
recruit Lillia Calderou, a divination witch

505
00:45:16,341 --> 00:45:21,323
representing the air element, Jennifer Kael,
a potions witch representing the water element,

506
00:45:21,843 --> 00:45:27,365
Alice Wu Gulliver, a protection witch representing
the fire element, and her neighbor, Sharon

507
00:45:27,405 --> 00:45:32,408
Davis to stand in for a green witch to represent
the earth element. While singing the ballad

508
00:45:32,428 --> 00:45:37,069
of the witches' road to open the portal to their
journey, the Salem Seven come after Agatha.

509
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:41,832
Though the door to the road doesn't initially
open, prompting Agatha to antagonize the coven

510
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:47,515
into attacking her, a doorway finally appears
and the coven, along with Teen, flee into it

511
00:45:47,555 --> 00:45:53,578
to escape the approaching Salem 7. One thing
I didn't understand in the show is why Billy

512
00:45:53,638 --> 00:45:58,860
was deceptive about his true intentions. Like,
why would he say that he needed power if what

513
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,911
he was really looking for was his brother? That's
a great question. I think maybe he didn't want

514
00:46:04,951 --> 00:46:11,292
to clue her into the idea that he was the Scarlet
Witch's son, because in doing research on Agatha

515
00:46:11,332 --> 00:46:15,334
Harkness, he probably would have known that
they fought against each other, and maybe he

516
00:46:15,374 --> 00:46:19,735
thought he might put himself in danger by revealing
his true identity. But then again, he did reveal

517
00:46:19,775 --> 00:46:25,697
his identity. It was just hidden by the sigil.
So, great question. And I think that's probably

518
00:46:25,757 --> 00:46:30,314
one of those things that doesn't hold up on
the rewatch, because... The real reason why

519
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:34,256
he didn't do it is because the writers didn't
want to clue the audience into the idea that

520
00:46:34,296 --> 00:46:40,038
this was Billy. Even though everyone knew even
before the show aired? Right, exactly. But

521
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,340
that's the only rationalization you could give
to your question. The Ballad of the Witches

522
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:49,523
Road song here was superbly done. Like, when
they started going in round with the song,

523
00:46:49,603 --> 00:46:53,905
I was getting fucking chills, man. That chant
was awesome. What did you think of the Salem

524
00:46:53,945 --> 00:46:59,283
7? Terrifying? Absolutely terrifying. They're
like ringwraiths. Yeah, I really like that

525
00:46:59,304 --> 00:47:03,126
because they're not like that in the comics
at all. They're more like a ragtag group of

526
00:47:03,186 --> 00:47:06,968
sorcerers that happen to be the children of
Nicholas Scratch. But here, yeah, they were

527
00:47:07,008 --> 00:47:12,691
like ringwraiths and they were like represented
by various woodland animals like a fox, a crow,

528
00:47:12,791 --> 00:47:17,313
snake, owl, rat. The one downside, I think,
is that they were more of an abstract threat

529
00:47:17,474 --> 00:47:21,916
than a tangible one because they never caught
up to the group. You know, they never actually

530
00:47:21,956 --> 00:47:26,010
got to fight the Salem Seven, which is kind
of disappointing. I mean, I will say that Lillia

531
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:30,871
Caldru took them out in the most badass way
possible. Oh, yeah. But you were kind of expecting

532
00:47:30,911 --> 00:47:35,493
this climactic showdown that never really happened.
Well, by the time we got the reveal that she

533
00:47:35,533 --> 00:47:40,814
was death, I was kind of like, OK, she's the
big bad. I understand now. I didn't really

534
00:47:40,874 --> 00:47:44,035
mind the way they were taken out because, like
you mentioned, I thought that was really cool.

535
00:47:44,575 --> 00:47:49,857
So I was fine with it. They served their purpose
in being spooky. They didn't appear too many

536
00:47:49,917 --> 00:47:57,146
times in the show itself. So yeah. Yeah. Episode
3 was called The Many Miles of Tricks and Trials.

537
00:47:57,667 --> 00:48:02,148
The coven enter the first trial on the Witch's
Road, a coastal home with a bottle of wine

538
00:48:02,188 --> 00:48:07,029
that poisons the group. The coven race to find
ingredients for a cure to be brewed by Jennifer

539
00:48:07,069 --> 00:48:12,371
Kael, but face hallucinations from their past
that hinder their efforts. Teen learns the

540
00:48:12,411 --> 00:48:17,512
rumor that Agatha traded her son Nicholas Scratch
for the Darkhold, and Agatha sees a vision

541
00:48:17,592 --> 00:48:22,273
of her former child's bassinet. The house floods
as the final ingredients are put together.

542
00:48:22,626 --> 00:48:28,149
but the coven is unable to deliver the potion
in time to Mrs. Davis and she dies. The group

543
00:48:28,189 --> 00:48:33,453
escapes the coastal home back onto the Witch's
Road. Talk about setting the stakes. I was

544
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:38,136
actually shocked when Sharon Davis died. Oh
yeah, absolutely. The show did a fantastic

545
00:48:38,176 --> 00:48:42,079
job setting the stakes, so much so that I didn't
even believe she was dead initially. Because

546
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:45,521
I was like, there's no way they're going to
be killing off characters in the show, but

547
00:48:45,561 --> 00:48:49,964
sure enough, they did it. Yeah, and I thought
Agatha's callousness was played to great comedic

548
00:48:49,984 --> 00:48:56,133
effect when she was like, who's Sharon? I was
like, jeez. And then the episode ended. They

549
00:48:56,173 --> 00:49:00,536
kept that up all the way to the very last episode,
too. That was great. Yeah. She was like, who?

550
00:49:02,858 --> 00:49:06,662
One thing I do think is interesting just in
hindsight is that when Agatha pulled back the

551
00:49:06,702 --> 00:49:11,626
bassinet cover, there was the dark hold, but
that's not really what happened. So that was

552
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:17,338
a manifestation of what Billy thought happened.
Right. As opposed to. You know, his powers

553
00:49:17,378 --> 00:49:22,563
reading Agatha's mind and then manifesting something
that was more in line with what she would actually

554
00:49:22,603 --> 00:49:27,227
fear. I wonder why he never read her mind. I
don't think he had good control over his ability.

555
00:49:27,488 --> 00:49:31,571
But apparently his subconscious did, right?
Again, just all the weirdness. I'm telling

556
00:49:31,611 --> 00:49:37,096
you, the revelation of the road being a manifestation
of Billy's unconscious is a bigger issue than

557
00:49:37,116 --> 00:49:42,561
you think it is. Hmm. Okay. Episode 4 is called,
If I Can't Reach You, Let My Song Teach You.

558
00:49:43,038 --> 00:49:47,021
In it, Agatha and the Coven decide to summon
a new Green Witch to take Mrs. Davis' place,

559
00:49:47,261 --> 00:49:52,506
and they end up bringing Rio onto the road.
The next trial manifests as a 1970s recording

560
00:49:52,546 --> 00:49:57,831
studio where the Wu family curse manifests as
a demon that attacks and nearly kills Tein.

561
00:49:58,211 --> 00:50:02,935
In order to defeat the demon, the Coven is forced
to play Alice's mother's rendition of the ballad,

562
00:50:03,235 --> 00:50:07,800
which is revealed to be a protection spell.
With the demon and the curse vanquished, the

563
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:12,955
group go back to the road and heal Tein. Rio
reveals that she used to love Agatha, but hurt

564
00:50:12,995 --> 00:50:18,960
her deeply when doing her job. Privately, she
also reveals to Agatha that Teen is not her

565
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:23,603
son. It was at this point where, I know you
liked the Ballad of the Witches Road song,

566
00:50:24,023 --> 00:50:27,566
but where it kind of grew old for me. I was
like, oh, okay, we get it. Are you gonna sing

567
00:50:27,646 --> 00:50:33,650
it like every episode or what? They only sing
it twice. This was the second time. Well, I

568
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:37,913
guess they sing it again in the final episode
as we see it evolve through time. Although

569
00:50:37,933 --> 00:50:43,353
by that point, I was just so caught up in how
the song even developed and why it became so

570
00:50:43,393 --> 00:50:48,738
important to the series as a whole that I was
much more forgiving of it. Yeah. I think the

571
00:50:48,798 --> 00:50:54,623
weirdness regarding Billy's manifestation here
manifested in that Billy almost died. You know,

572
00:50:54,924 --> 00:51:00,328
he created something that nearly killed him
by knocking him through the window. Oh, that's

573
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:06,530
true. Yeah. If he was like unconscious or dying,
why was the road even still there maybe? That's

574
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:10,231
a good question. I'm trying to think if there
were any instances where the Scarlet Witch

575
00:51:10,411 --> 00:51:14,812
was unconscious during the events of Westview,
but you have to imagine that she slept at some

576
00:51:14,832 --> 00:51:21,014
point. So I think the Chaos Magic reality still
operates when the Spellcaster is not conscious.

577
00:51:21,554 --> 00:51:26,975
That's fair. Episode five was called Darkest
Hour, Wake Thy Power. The Coven flee the Salem

578
00:51:27,035 --> 00:51:31,717
Seven by enchanting broomsticks for themselves.
Though they managed to escape, the road's magic

579
00:51:31,777 --> 00:51:36,538
forces them down to the next trial, a cabin
in the woods. They're forced to use a Ouija

580
00:51:36,558 --> 00:51:41,640
board to summon the ghost of Agatha's mother,
whom she killed back in 1693 when her magic

581
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:46,622
absorption power first manifested. The ghost
possesses Agatha, who attacks the group and

582
00:51:46,662 --> 00:51:51,344
claims the way to pass the trial is to continue
on the road without her daughter, claiming

583
00:51:51,405 --> 00:51:56,527
she was born evil. The ghost possesses Agatha
again, prompting Alice to blast her with fire

584
00:51:56,567 --> 00:52:01,509
magic, dispelling the ghost but activating Agatha's
absorption power which drains Alice of her

585
00:52:01,549 --> 00:52:06,572
magic and kills her. Back on the road, Teen
gets upset with Agatha and claims Witchcraft

586
00:52:06,612 --> 00:52:10,956
should not be about killing. Agatha cryptically
remarks that he is so much like his mother,

587
00:52:11,116 --> 00:52:15,379
prompting his magic abilities to manifest as
he forces Agatha and the rest of the coven

588
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:20,624
to sink into the mud. I think the weirdness
here with the Chaos Magic reality manifestation

589
00:52:20,744 --> 00:52:24,567
was, first of all, you know, the killing of
Alice, which I think played into the end scene

590
00:52:24,587 --> 00:52:29,211
pretty well because Billy's over here telling
Agatha that Witchcraft is not about killing,

591
00:52:29,291 --> 00:52:34,779
and she looks at him and she's like, are you
sure? he was the cause of Alice's death in

592
00:52:34,799 --> 00:52:39,463
that moment. Well, he wasn't though, because
Agatha was responsible for that. Yeah, but

593
00:52:39,543 --> 00:52:44,047
Billy was the reason that her mother's ghost
was there and took over her body, which led

594
00:52:44,087 --> 00:52:50,492
to Alice protecting Agatha. So, he was indirectly
the cause of it. That's true. Same thing with

595
00:52:50,612 --> 00:52:58,058
Mrs. Davis's death. So, Billy manifested Agatha's
mom's ghost, which possessed her. Yes. Okay,

596
00:52:58,578 --> 00:53:04,026
interesting. Well, then was the Ouija board
real? None of it was real, man. Yeah, okay.

597
00:53:04,046 --> 00:53:07,568
I'm kind of confused now because like the Ouija
board was saying like death was among them

598
00:53:07,588 --> 00:53:12,290
and death was among them But he didn't know
that at the time. It's wild. I think the initial

599
00:53:12,310 --> 00:53:19,133
Ouija boards Message was actually fake. It was
Agatha Harkness fucking around. She said death

600
00:53:19,173 --> 00:53:24,215
was among them I think is kind of like a jest
which Rio laughed at but then you know She

601
00:53:24,275 --> 00:53:30,294
pretended to be mrs. Davis come back from the
dead. That was weird. That was stupid It was

602
00:53:30,354 --> 00:53:35,158
unnecessary, it kind of felt like a moment of
filler, I think. I will admit, when the Ouija

603
00:53:35,178 --> 00:53:39,741
board spelled Mrs. Hart, I could have sworn
it spelled Mr. Shart.

604
00:53:43,582 --> 00:53:48,326
I thought the same thing because you know, the
subtitles were reciting the letters as they

605
00:53:48,366 --> 00:53:53,150
were naming them and written out, it looked
like Mr. Chart. So, I was like, what the hell

606
00:53:53,170 --> 00:54:01,197
is that? That was hilarious. Episode 6 was called
Familiar by Thy Side. In a flashback, William

607
00:54:01,217 --> 00:54:06,221
Kaplan from Eastview celebrates his bar mitzvah
where he encounters Lillia the fortune teller.

608
00:54:06,642 --> 00:54:10,865
She has a premonition of his future casting
a sigil on him to protect him from other witches.

609
00:54:11,446 --> 00:54:15,387
During the ride home, William and his family
get into a car accident at the same time the

610
00:54:15,427 --> 00:54:20,288
Scarlet Witch removes her hex over Westview,
erasing her twin boys Billy and Tommy from

611
00:54:20,348 --> 00:54:25,909
existence. As William dies from the accident,
Billy's soul survives by reincarnating into

612
00:54:25,969 --> 00:54:30,991
his body, and he wakes up in the hospital with
no recollection of either of his previous lives,

613
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:36,092
but retaining the ability to read minds. Three
years later, Billy confesses to his boyfriend

614
00:54:36,112 --> 00:54:40,733
that he believes he died that day and that his
reincarnation is tied into the Westview event.

615
00:54:41,322 --> 00:54:46,405
He contacts Ralf Boner, whom Agatha previously
used as a puppet to investigate the Scarlet

616
00:54:46,425 --> 00:54:52,209
Witch. Ralf reveals to Billy Agatha's existence
and status under Wanda's spell, and also tells

617
00:54:52,249 --> 00:54:57,853
him about Wanda's son, making Billy realize
who he is. Looking into Agatha Harkness, he

618
00:54:57,893 --> 00:55:02,136
learns of the witch's road and breaks into her
home to steal a personal artifact to break

619
00:55:02,156 --> 00:55:07,600
her of the spell. Back in the present, Agatha
claws her way out of the mud as Billy destroys

620
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:12,463
the sigil hiding his identity. She deduces that
he's seeking his brother Tommy at the end of

621
00:55:12,503 --> 00:55:17,085
the road, and the two continue on together.
Now, I think you and I both mentioned that

622
00:55:17,245 --> 00:55:23,128
one of the biggest mistakes Marvel has done
was the whole misdirection with Evan Peters

623
00:55:23,468 --> 00:55:29,811
as Pietro Maximoff in WandaVision. Correct,
yeah. The fact that they were able to play

624
00:55:29,971 --> 00:55:37,062
up on that with Bonerific69, AKA Ralph Boner,
was, I thought, a stroke of genius. Yeah, I

625
00:55:37,082 --> 00:55:40,884
mean, that didn't really have anything to do
with the previous misdirection. There are massive

626
00:55:40,924 --> 00:55:44,947
issues, and I think it's one of Marvel's biggest
missteps in that subversion of casting the

627
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:48,990
guy from Days of Future Past in the same time
that they're introducing the multiverse concept.

628
00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:54,934
But I talk all about that in our WandaVision
review. Here, Evan Peters continues playing

629
00:55:55,014 --> 00:55:59,878
Ralph Boner for laughs, which I think are very
well earned. The character is just hilarious.

630
00:56:00,478 --> 00:56:04,601
And I don't know if they've made Ralph Boner
yet a character in the comics, but if they

631
00:56:04,641 --> 00:56:11,277
haven't, they need to. because he's just too
good to not be a regular fixture within Marvel.

632
00:56:11,337 --> 00:56:16,259
No, I'm not going to lie. For a second I was
really hoping that he was actually Nicholas

633
00:56:16,299 --> 00:56:20,722
Scratch and that was going to be like a big
reveal at the very end. That ended up not being

634
00:56:20,742 --> 00:56:25,245
the case. But yeah, that's what I thought for
a while. Well, I thought Nicholas Scratch was

635
00:56:25,265 --> 00:56:30,808
going to be the main bad guy considering that
he is Agatha Harkness's biggest antagonist

636
00:56:30,948 --> 00:56:36,802
in the comic books. Her and her son do not get
along. But I like even more what they did here,

637
00:56:37,243 --> 00:56:43,104
where he was just this sweet innocent kid. Yeah,
no, that was expertly done for sure. Episode

638
00:56:43,124 --> 00:56:48,886
7 was called Death's Hand in Mine. Agatha and
Billy find the next trial, a castle tower where

639
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:53,668
they're made to read tarot cards in the proper
sequence or face impalement from swords falling

640
00:56:53,688 --> 00:56:57,949
from the ceiling. They're discovered by Lillia
and Jennifer who find their way from under

641
00:56:57,969 --> 00:57:03,082
the mud into the castle. with help from Lillia's
precognition which told her to find the secret

642
00:57:03,142 --> 00:57:08,724
bookshelf into the room. Using her skills of
divination, Lillia uses the tarot deck to read

643
00:57:08,744 --> 00:57:14,026
her own fortune. In her last card, she learns
that Rio is actually the personification of

644
00:57:14,106 --> 00:57:19,187
death, and that she is the end of her road.
Lillia saves the rest of the coven who escape

645
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:24,869
the room just as the Salem 7 catch up to them.
She stays behind, using the tarot deck to invert

646
00:57:24,889 --> 00:57:32,925
the castle tower and destroy the seven and herself.
This episode reminded me of Crisis on Infinite

647
00:57:33,025 --> 00:57:39,831
Earths part one with the nonlinear narrative.
When you have a nonlinear narrative like this

648
00:57:39,891 --> 00:57:45,676
episode, like the movie Memento, everything
is a twist, right? And I really like the way

649
00:57:45,696 --> 00:57:50,440
that it played out here. I think this episode
is gonna get nominated for an Emmy. It would

650
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:56,385
be a shame if it doesn't. I'd be truly shocked
if it didn't win. This episode and the last

651
00:57:56,425 --> 00:58:01,468
episode. were my two favorite episodes, but
I think this one edges out the last one just

652
00:58:01,588 --> 00:58:06,310
barely. I really, really liked it. Yeah, Patti
LuPone gave a great performance. I really like

653
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:11,493
how the episode ended with her first divination
spell with her maestra. It was just poetry.

654
00:58:11,633 --> 00:58:17,136
It was poetry. Really well written and beautifully
executed from everything to the castle tower

655
00:58:17,156 --> 00:58:20,738
with the falling swords. That was so cool. Like
the costumes. There was a little bit of brand

656
00:58:20,778 --> 00:58:25,421
synergy going there with like the Disney outfits
and whatnot, but I didn't mind it so much just

657
00:58:25,461 --> 00:58:30,816
because it really fit the theme. and the room
itself was pretty dangerous and cool. Episode

658
00:58:30,916 --> 00:58:36,820
8 was called, Follow Me My Friend to Glory at
the End. Alice follows Rio as Death into the

659
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:41,584
afterlife, after which Death reveals to Agatha
that she's there to take Billy, who broke the

660
00:58:41,624 --> 00:58:47,128
rules of Death by reincarnating. Agatha wagers
with Death to get Billy to give himself up

661
00:58:47,168 --> 00:58:51,691
in exchange for leaving her alone. Agatha, Billy,
and Jennifer continue along the road until

662
00:58:51,711 --> 00:58:56,558
they come to their shoes left at the beginning,
realizing that the road is a loop. Confused

663
00:58:56,578 --> 00:59:01,081
and enraged, the group argues until Billy puts
his shoes back on, transporting Kim into an

664
00:59:01,181 --> 00:59:05,965
empty room for the final trial. He's joined
by the others, who have no clue how to proceed,

665
00:59:06,365 --> 00:59:11,989
when it's revealed that Jennifer's powers were
bound a century ago by Agatha Harkness herself,

666
00:59:12,429 --> 00:59:17,593
who was using witchcraft to make money at the
time. Jennifer performs an unbinding ritual,

667
00:59:17,773 --> 00:59:22,436
regaining her magic and freeing herself from
the road. Agatha and Billy perform a spell

668
00:59:22,477 --> 00:59:27,552
to locate Tommy's soul. and Billy places it
in the body of a boy who just drowned, also

669
00:59:27,613 --> 00:59:32,837
freeing himself from the road. Agatha completes
the Earth Trial by growing a dandelion from

670
00:59:32,857 --> 00:59:37,981
a seed, freeing herself from the road as well
but with no prize at the end. Death attacks

671
00:59:38,081 --> 00:59:43,105
Agatha, but she is rescued by Billy, who is
now Wiccan, who gives her some of his power.

672
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:47,709
Together they fight Death, but realize they
can't win, and Death demands one of them to

673
00:59:47,749 --> 00:59:52,913
return to the afterlife with her. Billy offers
to sacrifice himself, fulfilling Agatha's wager.

674
00:59:53,454 --> 00:59:58,957
However, Agatha reneges on her plan, kissing
death and choosing to sacrifice herself instead.

675
00:59:59,037 --> 01:00:04,581
Shocked, Billy goes home and comes to the realization
that the road was just a manifestation of his

676
01:00:04,741 --> 01:00:12,206
own chaos magic. Great episode. I was really
confused as to how Jennifer realized that Agatha

677
01:00:12,226 --> 01:00:16,970
was the one who put the Binding spell on her.
Uh, Agatha basically admitted it, putting it

678
01:00:17,010 --> 01:00:20,993
out there herself. You think she would have
done that earlier when their lives were in

679
01:00:21,033 --> 01:00:25,988
danger? That's... Actually, another great question,
and I think again, just part of the weirdness

680
01:00:26,288 --> 01:00:31,991
of the whole twist that the road wasn't real.
Even if the road was real, Agatha could have

681
01:00:32,011 --> 01:00:37,454
given her powers earlier. Yeah, that's true.
That's true. I think maybe it was more of a,

682
01:00:37,554 --> 01:00:42,757
I don't want to get in trouble type thing, maybe.
I did think that the slow reveal in Billy's

683
01:00:42,817 --> 01:00:48,560
room that he created the road was kind of cheap
considering we didn't really get good looks

684
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:52,982
at those things earlier in the show. I kind
of wish there was a scene that kind of explored

685
01:00:53,002 --> 01:00:56,643
a little bit more earlier in the series. Well,
it was straight out of usual suspects, right?

686
01:00:56,883 --> 01:01:01,024
It was the usual suspects moment. For sure.
Yeah. I don't know if that was a direct homage

687
01:01:01,044 --> 01:01:04,865
or just a ripoff, but I kind of liked it. I
mean, I think it's an interesting reveal. I

688
01:01:04,885 --> 01:01:10,407
just thought it was cheap. Yeah, I don't disagree.
The whole spell where Billy used his psychic

689
01:01:10,427 --> 01:01:15,308
ability to find Tommy's soul and put it into
the body of a dying boy, that was fascinating.

690
01:01:15,408 --> 01:01:20,846
I think the line that happened at the end there
was one of the best of the entire series He

691
01:01:21,006 --> 01:01:27,831
asks Agatha if he's killing this boy just to
bring back his brother. And she says, no, sometimes

692
01:01:27,871 --> 01:01:33,095
little boys just die. And that was really touching
as we learned in the next episode, which was

693
01:01:33,135 --> 01:01:40,040
called Maiden Mother Crone. In a flashback to
1750, Agatha is giving birth to her son as

694
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:44,743
her lover, Death, comes to claim him. Begging
for mercy, Death grants her special treatment,

695
01:01:45,103 --> 01:01:50,546
giving the child more time, but refusing to
say how much. Agatha raises the young boy Nicholas,

696
01:01:50,726 --> 01:01:55,328
traveling the country and killing witches to
increase her own magical power as a means to

697
01:01:55,368 --> 01:01:59,670
protect her son. In their travels, Nicholas
invents a song about their journey down the

698
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:05,132
road, a tune which catches on among the witch
community. Though Nicholas questions his mother's

699
01:02:05,232 --> 01:02:10,235
actions, they have a close loving relationship
which leaves Agatha devastated when the boy

700
01:02:10,255 --> 01:02:15,036
grows ill and dies one night. She then uses
the ballad as a means to prey on the power

701
01:02:15,077 --> 01:02:19,466
of unsuspecting witches looking to find the
road. growing her magic over the centuries.

702
01:02:19,966 --> 01:02:24,268
When the doorway to the road actually manifests
in her latest attempt with Lily, Jennifer,

703
01:02:24,348 --> 01:02:29,831
Alice, and Billy, she realizes who Billy is
and recognizes the road as a manifestation

704
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:35,273
of his chaos magic. Back in the present, Agatha
comes back as a ghost to guide Billy in his

705
01:02:35,313 --> 01:02:40,235
powers and help him find his brother Tommy.
Now there's a line here right after Agatha

706
01:02:40,275 --> 01:02:44,877
gives birth where she says that she made her
son Nicholas from scratch and that's why he

707
01:02:44,897 --> 01:02:49,623
gets his name. Is that implied that he's a virgin
birth or is that implied that, you know, she

708
01:02:49,643 --> 01:02:54,745
made him the old-fashioned way? Not with any
magic, but you know knocking boots. I think

709
01:02:54,765 --> 01:03:00,747
it's the latter. Yeah She brought life into
being without using magic But you know using

710
01:03:00,828 --> 01:03:07,470
the good old basic ingredients basically birds
in the bees exactly It was such a tragic scene,

711
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:13,513
especially as a dad now just seeing agatha's
reaction to no longer having her child Just

712
01:03:13,713 --> 01:03:18,802
broke my heart like oh, yeah Just even when
the kid was getting sick, I was like, please

713
01:03:18,842 --> 01:03:23,084
don't let this happen. You just really felt
for her in the same way that you felt for Wanda

714
01:03:23,324 --> 01:03:28,605
in WandaVision. I felt for him. The whole time
I was kind of like, beat him. Don't let him

715
01:03:28,625 --> 01:03:34,867
sleep outside. What are you doing? Yeah, give
him a nice home. Don't wander around, you know,

716
01:03:34,907 --> 01:03:39,728
traveling the countryside, gaining power to
defend him. Your time might be better spent

717
01:03:39,848 --> 01:03:44,354
just, you know, taking care of the kid, you
know? Right. Giving him stability. That's kind

718
01:03:44,374 --> 01:03:49,738
of the whole tragedy of it all, you know? Yeah,
she loved him. She just didn't know how to

719
01:03:49,798 --> 01:03:55,081
care for him. Yeah. I think it's really awesome
that she's a ghost now because Agatha Harkness

720
01:03:55,101 --> 01:04:00,786
has been a ghost in the comics, you know, advising
people even from the afterlife. And you know,

721
01:04:00,826 --> 01:04:05,129
she's not only been a mentor to Franklin Richards,
she's also helped out, you know, the Scarlet

722
01:04:05,149 --> 01:04:10,352
Witch. She was a professor at Strange Academy
helping people like Nico Minoru. She's cared

723
01:04:10,372 --> 01:04:15,707
for even Billy and Tommy. So basically the story
puts these characters to the point where they

724
01:04:15,747 --> 01:04:20,609
are in the comics. I thought it was really well
done. Not only that, but her reasoning for

725
01:04:20,649 --> 01:04:26,952
staying behind as a ghost in that she couldn't
face her son in the afterlife was very profound.

726
01:04:27,352 --> 01:04:31,634
Yeah, I think she doesn't want him to really
see the person that she became after his death.

727
01:04:32,014 --> 01:04:37,096
Like even worse than she already was? Yeah,
exactly. That's crazy. I was also excited to

728
01:04:37,136 --> 01:04:41,830
see her white hair. That was awesome. Yeah.
more in keeping with her look in the books.

729
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:46,852
I can't wait to see her show up again because
these characters are just too good to stop

730
01:04:46,912 --> 01:04:52,655
here. No, I agree. Yeah. I'm definitely looking
forward to seeing both Wiccan and Agatha Harkness

731
01:04:52,715 --> 01:04:58,997
in future Marvel projects. There are certain
storylines that Marvel has done post-Endgame

732
01:04:59,457 --> 01:05:05,640
that I think have resonated more than others.
With this show, I think one of the strongest

733
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:11,871
threads they have still going is WandaVision
by far. Yeah, WandaVision, Agatha all along,

734
01:05:12,131 --> 01:05:16,874
and the upcoming Vision Quest are all part of
like a trilogy of shows, according to the showrunner.

735
01:05:16,995 --> 01:05:20,957
I think we're really getting a lot more of what
we love about the Marvel Cinematic Universe

736
01:05:21,077 --> 01:05:25,080
with these television series. Marvel sucks.
Really? You're talking about how great the

737
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:29,303
show is and then you're following it up with
Marvel sucks? I think you might be a little

738
01:05:29,323 --> 01:05:35,208
bit confused there. I have to circle back somehow,
you know? That's the whole review. In summary,

739
01:05:35,588 --> 01:05:40,506
you know, the show's blend of shifting settings.
eclectic characters and jaw-dropping twists

740
01:05:40,566 --> 01:05:47,228
come together to conjure a delightfully unpredictable
journey. I am rating the show 4.5 stars out

741
01:05:47,268 --> 01:05:52,709
of 5, one of Marvel's best television series
ever, and I'm giving it a fresh rating on Rotten

742
01:05:52,729 --> 01:05:59,671
Tomatoes. Yeah, 4.5 is a really high score.
If you had told me before I had seen it that

743
01:05:59,711 --> 01:06:04,473
you wanted to rate it that high, I would have
not believed you. But having seen it with my

744
01:06:04,653 --> 01:06:11,161
own eyes, it's hard to fantastic. I agree with
you. One of Marvel's best shows. I enjoyed

745
01:06:11,181 --> 01:06:16,305
it way more than I thought I would. So yeah,
4.5. Really, it's about as good of a Agatha

746
01:06:16,345 --> 01:06:20,929
Harkness show as you can get. Even better than
that, actually. So like it did not even need

747
01:06:20,969 --> 01:06:27,775
to be this good. It's fucking... They did not
need to go this hard. Right. But yeah, that

748
01:06:27,815 --> 01:06:34,106
does it for this review. AJ9K helped close this
out. Thanks for listening to Dynamic duel.

754
01:07:03,740 --> 01:07:10,708
be doing another television review, this time
on the DC end, with HBO's The Penguin series,

755
01:07:10,768 --> 01:07:16,494
which takes place in Matt Reeves' The Batman
Universe. I haven't started watching it yet,

756
01:07:16,915 --> 01:07:21,280
but I'm just going to binge the whole thing,
and from what I've heard it's really good,

757
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:25,604
so I can't wait. Well, let's see if it's as
good as Agatha all along. Obviously, they're

758
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:29,747
going to be very different shows. You know,
Agatha is very fantasy magic. The Penguin is

759
01:07:29,807 --> 01:07:34,811
very gritty, realistic, grounded crime drama.
I'm expecting good things from it. Yeah, I

760
01:07:34,831 --> 01:07:40,255
think both of these shows has the potential
to showcase the best of both worlds. The best

761
01:07:40,295 --> 01:07:44,218
of what each studio has to offer. Exactly. But
that does it for this episode. We want to give

762
01:07:44,238 --> 01:07:48,922
