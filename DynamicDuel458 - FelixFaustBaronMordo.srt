This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi, welcome to
the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,000
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,220
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Johnny DC and I'm his twin

4
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:45,100
brother Marvelous Joe. And in this episode we are
doing another spooktober duel, this time pitting

5
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:52,440
the dark sorcerers of Felix Faust and Baron Mordo
against each other. Yeah, basically my wife told

6
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:59,200
me that if Marvel doesn't fucking win one, then
she's gonna divorce me. So there's a lot writing on

7
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,680
this one. Literally she said like in the last
episode she was like, I'm sick of this shit. So

8
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:10,380
we're really writing on this one guys. Baron
Mordo, I think has a good chance of winning this. I

9
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:15,980
don't think that's right. I think DC is gonna get
another win. I think you're fucked. I think you're

10
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:23,020
a fuck. I think that's a compliment. I'm not 100%
though. But we're gonna run the stats and figure

11
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:27,600
out who's gonna win between those two characters
later on in the episode. Before that we're gonna

12
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,520
break down the comic book movie news of which there
was quite a bit because we had New York Comic Con

13
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,600
this past week. So we got a Wonder Man official
trailer, a Bat Fam official trailer. We learned

14
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,660
that Marvin Crandon Jones III is going to play
Tombstone in Spider-Man Brand New Day. And we

15
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:50,440
learned that Batman Nightfall animated films are
in the works. As always we list our segment times in

31
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:01,900
of the way quick to the no prize. The no prize is an
award that Marvel used to give out to fans. Our

32
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,760
version the Dynamic Dual No Prize is a digital
award we post on Instagram for the person that we

33
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,560
feel gave the best answer to our question of the
week. Last week we asked you guys what do you think

34
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:17,300
has been the scariest moment in a Marvel or DC film
or TV series and we asked this because it's

35
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,420
Halloween season. Got a lot of great answers let's
run down our honorable mentions as well as the no

36
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:27,860
prize winner. Our first honorable mention goes to
Travis Herndon who said what's up dynamic dudes

37
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,700
Travis here shout out to Mabel Twin so my scariest
moment would have to be watching the Flash movie no

38
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,500
it's like not but my answer would have to be
Guardians of the Galaxy volume 3's Rockets

39
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:44,120
backstory just while it's not like a spooky scary
thing just seeing like what rocket and the rest of

40
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,140
the animals there had to go through with the
experimentation and the body modifications that

41
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:54,600
is kind of scary to watch especially if you're an
animal lover so that's my pick Rockets backstory.

42
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,260
Yeah that was really creepy in like a body horror
sense the experiments that the animals went

43
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:05,840
through under the high evolutionary was not just
like creepy to look at but it was also really

44
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,240
uncomfortable to think about in terms of like
animal torture you had Lila the otter who's like

45
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,440
arms were missing and then Tiefs who if I remember
correctly had wheels and then there was Floor the

46
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:23,180
rabbit who they gave like spider legs and like
removed its entire jaw it was truly horrifying

47
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:29,700
yeah great answer Travis our next honorable
mention goes to Mason Thompson who said what's up

48
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:39,480
y'all um I kind of had to think about this but once I
thought about it immediately the trench attack

49
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:50,340
from Aquaman oh my gosh seeing that it just gives
like jaw vibes or like 30 meters down like just all

50
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:58,520
of them surrounding them terrifying dude had me
butt clenched all right thanks peace I too was butt

51
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:04,520
clenched during that scene it was really well done
by horror master James Wan who directed Aquaman

52
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,500
I've been feeling the trench were put into that
movie specifically for that scene so that he could

53
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,660
exercise his horror talent in the movie I haven't
seen the movie too many times but yeah that scene

54
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:20,260
does stick out to me I remember just seeing like the
entire swarm of trench like there were so many more

55
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:25,720
than you could possibly fathom down in those
depths and I was really like nervous for how

56
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,980
Aquaman was going to get out of that well even
before that when they're still on the boat and

57
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,640
they're climbing on board and like breaking
windows and stuff like that that was why great

58
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:40,700
answer our next honorable mention goes to Alex
Albro and by Dear Bangora who gave the same answer

59
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,660
and that is hey guys I know it's iconic but the
scariest moment in a Marvel movie for me honestly

60
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,520
is the blood rave and the first blade movie it's
just freaky to look at man especially for the time

61
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:58,060
you know it's just scary image odd way to start a
movie I'm not sure I was there for it kind of made me

62
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,060
freak out a little bit going into the first blade
movie you know I'm just out here trying to ice skate

63
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:08,920
uphill not take a literal blood bath thanks guys
bye dynamic doll I think the scariest moment has to

64
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:18,120
be the blood rave during blade I think that was
terrifying just to be put in that position and be

65
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:25,720
surrounded by vampires and when blood pouring
must be extremely devastating this is Badiere

66
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:31,820
thank you yeah I feel like the blood rave scene is
kind of like a pop culture touchstone like a lot of

67
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:36,280
people know about the blood rave scene probably
even if you haven't seen the blade movie I think but

68
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:43,420
I remember like seeing the movie in theaters when I
came out in 1998 and Jesus I was only like 12 years

69
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:51,300
old but I remember the guy at the club and like all of
a sudden stuff started dripping on him and he was as

70
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,980
confused as the audience was and then we realized
that it was blood and I just remember being like

71
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:05,440
holy shit like oh oh no no because it all started and
then it turns out literally every single other

72
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,480
person at that rave was a vampire like he was the
only human that was nuts I was like this is so

73
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:17,120
nightmarish like what a crazy concept for it to be
just raining blood on you and just you're totally

74
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,540
fucked like there's no way you're getting out of it
and then of course blade shows up and saves the day

75
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,800
but uh yeah it was it was pretty freaky on that first
watch and then on subsequent watches it kind of

76
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,980
became cool because you knew that blade was coming
and that you were about to get a great action scene

77
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:36,700
but yeah that first time was really unsettling
it's still my favorite scene from a blade movie and

78
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:43,120
it was like the first blade movie scene yeah they
just nailed it right out the gate for sure great

79
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:50,360
answer alex and by dear but the winner of this
week's no prize is Lorenzo Valdes who said I would

80
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:55,840
say that the scariest moment in a marvel or dc movie
is in the dark night when they're in mayor Garcia's

81
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:02,040
office and the imposter batman slams against the
window and I picked this moment because that's a

82
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:07,900
movie I've seen so many times and yet over and over
and over again the moment works as a jump scare for

83
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:14,440
me clon of forever and always bye bye I still
remember physically jolting out of my seat when

84
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,800
the imposter batman slammed against mayor
Garcia's window I was not expecting that it kind of

85
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:25,580
came out of nowhere it's like the ultimate jump
scare within a superhero film for sure I could even

86
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:30,020
concede that this is definitely the scariest
moment out of all the marvel and dc films I remember

87
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:35,400
jumping in my seat too and you know it's like unfair
because you're not expecting it because the dark

88
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,920
night is not a horror film I remember like not
appreciating it in the theaters when it happened I

89
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:47,320
was like I didn't sign up for this shit like what's
going on here is this a scary movie now am I gonna

90
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,320
have to expect this later on but no I thought I
thought it was a really effective moment in

91
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:57,680
selling the shock of the jokers actions and how he
is just chaos incarnate yeah you never quite knew

92
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,120
what he was gonna do and when he was gonna do it and
the video that was attached to the imposter batman

93
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:09,080
of the joker torturing him that was also pretty
terrifying yeah there are a lot of terrifying

94
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:14,680
joker moments in that film but that is the standout
one so great answer Lorenzo Valdes you win this

95
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:19,560
week's no prize if you're the listener want to shot
at winning your own no prize stay tuned to later on

96
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,760
in this episode when we'll be asking another
question of the week and now that that's done off to

97
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:34,700
the news all right this past week was new york city
comic con where we got a lot of marvel television

98
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:40,700
news they had an entire panel alongside the marvel
animation division we got some looks at daredevil

99
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,580
born again season two where we got to see a trailer
that also featured jessica jones although that

100
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:49,820
trailer wasn't featured publicly it was leaked
but we'll wait for that to be officially released

101
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:55,380
so that people could see it there was also news
about vision quest and x-men 97 and your friendly

102
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:00,820
neighborhood spider-man season two but the main
news that we got that was officially released was a

103
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:06,720
trailer for wonder man which is a television
series that's going to be debuting in january of

104
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,360
2026 its release date got pushed back a little bit
from its original december date and i gotta say i

105
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,760
knew that they were going to focus on simon
williams as an actor within this wonder man series

106
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,700
and that wonder man was basically a role that he was
going to play that's all fine you know simon

107
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:30,540
williams is one of the only superhero actors in
marvel comics and it is definitely a unique

108
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:36,700
approach and angle that we haven't really seen
before within these marvel shows and films that

109
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:43,500
being said my biggest takeaway from the wonder man
trailer was that this does not feel at all like a

110
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,940
superhero show and it seems intentionally to be
that way like they were trying to do something

111
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:56,640
completely different within the genre i don't
quite know if i like the idea or not just based on

112
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:04,380
this trailer i mean i'll say that the show looks
good for what it is i kind of like how meta it is how

113
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:09,400
this auteur film director is recreating the
wonder man popular television series from either

114
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,620
like the 70s or 80s i don't know it looks like flash
gordon to me which is pretty interesting but you

115
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:20,740
know the origin of wonder man from the comic books
is that he was kind of like a tony stark rival whose

116
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:26,340
business was driven into the ground he went to
prison for shady business dealings and then baron

117
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:32,060
zemo offered him a chance to get back at tony stark
by undergoing an experiment that turned his body

118
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:38,280
into ionic energy i mean we go into his backstory in
our captain adam versus wonder man dual episode

119
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:44,960
this looks completely removed from that now maybe
that whole backstory will kind of be loosely

120
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:49,220
adapted into the fictional backstory of the
wonder man character within the series that

121
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:53,840
they're adapting in this show and that would be
great but that's definitely not going to be the

122
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,940
origin story for yaya abdul matine the second's
character yeah it makes me wonder if we're

123
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:06,580
actually going to see yaya abdul matine as wonder
man and is he going to throw hands i'm not convinced

124
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:13,600
by this trailer i don't know if we'll see yaya in his
ionic form i'm sure we'll definitely see him in the

125
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,720
wonder man suit i'm assuming that at some point his
character will get superpowers that are similar

126
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:26,160
to wonder man's power set from the comic books and
then he'll be an actor who played the role of wonder

127
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,680
man who became a superhero during the filming
process and then goes on to fight evil after making

128
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:39,380
this movie i feel like it's not going to be that way
just because they anticipate the audience

129
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:43,760
expecting something like that and i think they
want to do something completely different with

130
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,820
this yeah they might pull like a she-hulk or
something where there is no big fight between good

131
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:55,360
versus evil in the show's climax and maybe subvert
it in some way but that wouldn't be satisfying just

132
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,140
like how the end to she-hulk wasn't satisfying i
hope they don't do that i hope this character

133
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:05,920
becomes an actual superhero and doesn't just play
one i love that ben kingsley is returning as trevor

134
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,800
slattery like that was one of my favorite parts of
this trailer just seeing him as that character

135
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:16,620
again his trevor slattery is great for sure i'm
wondering if simon williams gets the role of

136
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:22,520
wonder man in this movie then who is trevor gonna
play considering that he also auditions for the

137
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:29,300
same part i guess we'll find out when the show comes
out on january 27th in dc news we got the official

138
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:37,660
trailer for prime videos bat fam animated series
this is a spinoff of the holiday film they put out a

139
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:43,780
few years ago mary little batman which we reviewed
which i thought was great for the family after

140
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:49,100
watching this trailer i'm less enthused by the
whole approach they decided to take with this show

141
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:58,000
when i hear bat fam i think nightwing red hood robin
bat girl that whole cast of characters but based on

142
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:06,000
this trailer we're getting a pyrachonetic named
claire alfred's niece alicia a ghost of rossel

143
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:18,540
ghoul a geriatric man bat it's just fucking weird
the bat fam nobody asked for exactly exactly and

144
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:23,480
again i love the charming animation style the
character designs are actually pretty great

145
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,560
especially when it comes to like killer croc and
clay face and stuff like that but it's just so

146
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,400
different from what i was hoping they would do that
it's really hard to get excited about this show

147
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:41,740
well i mean one of the appeals of mary little batman
was seeing how that particular art style depicted

148
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:48,680
characters that you know and love like batman like
the joker it was all just part of the magic right and

149
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:54,080
yeah you're right seeing characters like clay
face and killer croc adapted in this style looks

150
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:59,520
like a whole lot of fun i also was really hoping to
see how they were going to take the characters that

151
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:04,560
were used to seeing the bat family and depicting
them in that art style too like i imagine that

152
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,340
nightwing would be like really buff and then like
they really focus on his glutes right and red hood

153
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:15,060
would be real like emo you know always having his
head down and stuff like that it would have been

154
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:19,960
cool to see in the style of animation absolutely
and so we have these characters in the trailer and

155
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:27,060
i'm just left wondering why like why would you take
a stable of characters that are beloved amongst

156
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:33,420
comic fans and just completely disregard it i'll
probably still end up watching this show because i

157
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:39,920
have prime and why not and i may actually find the
humor and storytelling charming but i can't

158
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,240
stress enough how much they dropped the ball and
how disappointed i am that this should have been

159
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:53,200
something very different yeah i mean you may end up
liking it but even if you do you're still gonna

160
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:57,740
wonder what could have been if they gave you more of
what you wanted all in all there's a lot of

161
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:03,040
questionable decisions for this show and with
wonder man so that brings us to our question of the

162
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:15,160
week regarding the wonder man and batfam series
trailers what the fuck did i just watch wrong

163
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:21,119
answers only i guess a good way to approach this
question is if you had to retitle these shows to be

164
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:26,260
more in line with your own personal thoughts on the
trailers what would they be called record your

169
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:52,080
before october 18th in other marvel news we
learned this past week according to deadline that

170
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:58,040
marvin jones the third aka crondon is going to play
the crime boss tombstone in the upcoming

171
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:03,820
spider-man brand new day film tombstone being a
spider-man villain a street level spider-man

172
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:09,060
villain one of the enforcers of the magea crime
family the character appeared in the spider-man

173
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:14,180
into the spider-verse film where he was actually
voiced by marvin jones the third so it'll be cool to

174
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:19,960
see him now play that role in live action i mean if
you could do it any differently from how he played

175
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:26,640
to bias wail in the black lightning tv series i'm
skeptical that's right yeah he did already play dc

176
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,760
villain who is very similar at least i guess an
attitude if not in power set i don't know what to

177
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:38,940
bias wail's powers are actually well he's a albino
gangster essentially a crime boss well that's

178
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:44,520
what tombstone is he's exactly you know gangster
okay all right well we'll see how this goes i'm sure

179
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:48,740
he'll take a somewhat different approach from his
role in black lightning but it's cool that he'll

180
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:53,480
have done both in marvel and dc live action villain
role when this film comes out the inclusion of

181
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:59,560
tombstone definitely reinforces the idea that
this is going to be a street level film which is very

182
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,360
interesting to me yeah it's gonna have tombstone
in it it's gonna have the punisher in it it's gonna

183
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,600
be a very different type of film than what we've
been getting from the spider-man franchise i

184
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,220
think it's gonna be more grounded maybe that'll be
pretty interesting to see execs have made some

185
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:18,560
comments that there are some like story tie-ins
from daredevil born against season two if you want

186
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,360
to learn more about tombstone go ahead and check
out our dual episode where we pit him against

187
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:26,380
blockbuster and hopefully we'll get to see what
the character looks like either in like set videos

188
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:31,920
or an upcoming trailer or something like that
again the movie is gonna come out in 2026 on july

189
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:38,720
31st in dc news my favorite news to come out of new
york comic con it was revealed that the batman

190
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:45,620
nightfall storyline is being put into production
as a multi-part animated film part one is coming

191
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:51,600
out next year in 2026 and it's going to focus on bane
really seeing batman's rogues gallery from

192
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,240
arkham asylum and batman's quest to capture all of
them nightfall is one of my favorite stories from

193
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:04,140
the comics it spanned multiple batman series
written by some of batman's best writers from

194
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:10,340
history including doug moanch chuck dixon ellen
granton denny o'neill and peter david of course it

195
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:18,540
includes the famous breaking of batman's back by
bane and the rise of asriel as a new armor-wearing

196
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:25,640
tech focused batman i'm sure we'll see asriel's
rise in part two but i can't wait to see the whole

197
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:31,640
storyline played out on screen i never thought we
would get an animated adaptation of that so it's

198
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:37,780
exciting to see them start to take a look at some of
the popular comic book story arcs and adapt those i

199
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,700
was actually surprised by this news because i
thought that james gunn was only going to start

200
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:48,060
featuring animated projects that tied into his
dcu projects like creature commandos that could

201
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:55,380
be the case for this for all we know this could be a
prequel of sorts or like a flashback-esque story a

202
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:01,840
prequel to the dcu version of batman possibly
interesting it would be a good way to get much

203
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:06,720
needed exposition and backstory out of the way
that way people could just jump right in with a live

204
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,440
action movie whenever that comes out i mean since
we've already seen batman get his back broken on

205
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:18,420
film in christopher nollens the dark knight rises
i'm sure there's no real need to retread that same

206
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:24,680
territory in live action so this approach may just
get that out of the way i am skeptical that this is

207
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:29,640
actually true it's interesting speculation
whether it is or isn't i'm still pumped for it

208
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,560
because again that's a fantastic storyline it's
the equivalent of the death of superman in my book

209
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:41,880
just a pivotal moment in batman's career yeah
where stakes actually meant something exactly

210
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:46,760
just how we didn't know if superman was going to
come back we didn't know when bruce wane was going

211
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:52,520
to return to the cowl we weren't told how many parts
the story was going to be told in but it's at least

212
00:21:52,520 --> 00:22:06,120
two if they do three i'm here for it my body is ready
but then does it for all the news for this episode

213
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:12,280
let's go ahead and move on to the main event where we
find out who is going to win between the dc and

214
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:34,420
marvel sorcerer characters of phoenix foust and
baron mordo okay phoenix foust versus baron mordo

215
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:40,900
as i stated earlier in the episode these are two
dark sorcerer villainous characters within dc

216
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:48,560
baron mordo of course was played by chouatelle in
the dr strange films we haven't seen phoenix foust

217
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:54,620
in live action that i'm aware of but he has been
featured pretty frequently in animated works

218
00:22:54,620 --> 00:23:00,140
yeah he had a really cool badass fight scene
against zetana in just asly dark i want to say the

219
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:06,540
film was right this is going to be kind of similar to
our dr fate versus dr strange dual episode i think

220
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:11,100
but considering that these characters are both
villains we're going to dabble more into the dark

221
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:16,740
magic side of things yeah i think it'll be pretty
fun to explain the methodology behind our duels

222
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:23,460
let's go to our sentient dual simulator elford
jarvis 9000 aj9k tell our listeners how you go

223
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:29,500
about determining a winner in our dual matchups
yes of course sir the way i determine a winner

224
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:34,020
between the contestants is by running 1000
montecarlo simulations using the characters

225
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:38,940
statistics a montecarlo simulation is a
probabilistic model used to determine outcomes

226
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,940
through random sampling in this case i randomize
the statistics along a normal distribution as a

227
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,840
way to simulate the many variables that can occur
during battle the stat parameters are based on the

228
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,380
official marvel power grid from which the dc
characters statistics are extrapolated

229
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:59,900
additional stat categories are included such as
range damage potential versatility and

230
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:05,380
perception in order to create a more detailed and
accurate simulation the results of the 1000

231
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:09,920
simulations provide a percentage of wins for each
character the contestant with the higher

232
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:15,460
percentage is declared the victor as they have a
higher probability to win any given battle in an

233
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:20,880
equitable pairing neither character should win
100 of the matches the comic book stories have

234
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,020
shown that there's even a way for batman to defeat
superman so the confidence rate of my method falls

235
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,820
in line with the precedents that have been
established in the source material my

236
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:34,280
mathematical simulations are without
subjectivity or bias feats are not the whole

237
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:40,440
consideration nor are fan votes tabulated for
determination of the winner thanks aj and iak

238
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,520
before we run the simulations though we'd like to
break down each character's histories and

239
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:50,180
abilities before improvising a scenario on how we
imagine one of the 1000 simulations would play out

240
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:55,100
beat for beat i believe it's my turn to go first with
the marvel characters backstory so let me tell you

241
00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:03,120
all about baron morto carl amadeus morto was born
in the transylvanian village of varfondra to

242
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:10,100
baron nicolai morto and baroness sarah crawler
his grandfather viscount hindrack crawler of

243
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:15,700
bavaria sought revenge against the allied powers
after world war two and attempted to steal

244
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:22,260
nicolai's emerging magical power through a spell
of transference when the spell failed crawler

245
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:27,460
ordered his daughter to marry nicolai so that
their child could serve as a conduit for the power

246
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:34,000
he craved sarah complied and nine months later
gave birth to carl raised in a cold household

247
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:39,580
carl's father was obsessed with restoring his
homeland to feudal glory while his mother

248
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:45,540
regarded her son merely as a pawn in her father's
schemes when crawler ordered sarah to kill her

249
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:52,140
husband she obeyed and fled with carl to bavaria
where crawler trained his grandson in black magic

250
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:57,760
after learning the truth of his father's death
carl swore vengeance on both his mother and

251
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:04,620
grandfather and vowed to rebuild a world ruled by
his own power as a young man morto traveled to tebet

252
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:10,800
to find the ancient one a powerful sorcerer said to
guard the secrets of true magic in the ancient ones

253
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:16,980
himalayan sanctuary morto's body aged slowly
under the effects of the mountain's mystical aura

254
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:22,780
though the ancient ones saw darkness in his new
pupil's heart he chose to teach him anyway hoping

255
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:29,060
to guide him toward wisdom while studying ancient
scrolls morto learned of the dread dor mamu the

256
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:35,060
ruler of the dark dimension against his master's
orders he contacted dor mamu finding himself to

257
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:41,220
the demon's influence morto returned to bavaria
sacrificing both his mother and grandfather to

258
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:47,080
dor mamu before continuing his studies under the
ancient one plotting to one day sacrifice him as

259
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:52,280
well you can learn more about dor mamu in his duel
against the demon trigon when another student

260
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:58,740
steven strange arrived seeking healing for his
injured hands morto viewed him as a rival upon

261
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:04,260
discovering morto's plot to kill their teacher
strange tried to warn the ancient one but morto

262
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:10,540
silenced him with a binding spell the ancient one
was aware of morto's treachery all along and freed

263
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:19,660
strange who accepted apprenticeship to stop
morto's schemes you can find out more about

264
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:31,060
morto's attempts to defeat strange in the ancient
one's temple morto's first attempts to defeat

265
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:35,820
strange included astral projection schemes and
hypnotic control of servants to poison the

266
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:41,100
ancient one strange continually foiled those
plans proving himself the superior sorcerer

267
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:46,540
morto lured strange into traps across europe
manipulated ectoplasmic warriors and even

268
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,620
imprisoned the ancient one but each student was
forced to leave the ancient one morto's first

269
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:53,640
attempt to kill strange was defeated seeking
greater power morto appealed to dor mamu He

270
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,180
simplified his abilities and sent him to destroy
Strange. Together they pursued Strange across

271
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:03,700
dimensions, but Dormammu turned on Mordo for
interfering in his duel with Strange and banished

272
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:09,060
him to the dimension of demons. Strange later
freed Mordo while rescuing other victims, and the

273
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:15,220
ancient one imprisoned him anew. Freed again
after the defeat of the entity called Zom, Dr.

274
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:21,160
Strange persuaded Mordo to help contain Zom's
scattered evil essence, convincing him to act as

275
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:26,360
the vessel for the dark power. Once empowered,
Mordo betrayed Strange, attacking him with

276
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:31,540
overwhelming might until Strange used the staff
of Polar Power to absorb his excess energy and

277
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:37,080
banish him. Mordo resurfaced, pretending to be
Dr. Strange during the Sorcerer Supreme's brief

278
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,440
loss of power, but Strange regained his strength
and exposed the deception. Obsessed with

279
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:48,960
uncovering ultimate magical truths, Mordo
pursued the time-traveling wizard C. Sneg to the

280
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:54,820
dawn of creation, witnessing the reconstruction
of the universe itself. The sight drove him

281
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:00,300
insane. Strange took him into his care, but Mordo
later escaped and renewed his pursuit of dark

282
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:05,740
power. When he robbed the San Gabriel Archives at
the Vatican, he attempted to unleash the Chaos

283
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:12,720
Demon by sacrificing 13 victims, including the
witch Jennifer Kale, but he was defeated by her and

284
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,140
Manthing, whom you can learn more about in his duel
with Swamp Thing. Mordo's lust for power often

285
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:24,280
drew him into the service of other dark entities.
He created the spectral being Azrael and sent him

286
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:30,600
to slay Dr. Strange, later manipulating Manthing
to do the same. During a battle that spanned time

287
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:36,100
itself, Mordo returned to the mid-20th century
and was ensnared by a plot involving Dormammu and

288
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:41,840
his ancestor, Crowler. Dormammu turned against
both Crowler and Mordo, destroying them before

289
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,740
Strange used their conflict to banish the demon
once more. Afterward, Mordo was recruited into

290
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,580
Mifisto's group called the Legion Accursed. You
can learn more about Mifisto in his duel against

291
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:58,080
Sandman. In time, Mordo's constant dealings with
infernal entities took their toll and he

292
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,520
developed terminal cancer. Desperate for a cure,
Mordo made simultaneous bargains with both

293
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:10,680
Mifisto and Satanish, promising each his soul.
When Mifisto and Satanish arrived to claim him,

294
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:15,700
their conflict threatened to consume all reality
until Strange exploited the demon's greed to

295
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:20,780
sever their hold on Mordo, freeing him though
leaving him spiritually weakened. Seeking

296
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:26,880
redemption, Mordo returned to Tibet, confessing
his sins to Dr. Strange and asked for forgiveness.

297
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,520
Strange granted it and Mordo died from cancer in
peace. He was subsequently pulled from the time

298
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:38,140
stream and recruited by the cosmic collector to
join the villainous offenders team alongside Red

299
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:43,740
Hulk, Tarix, and Tiger Shark. Mordo and the group
battled Strange and the defenders across time and

300
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:49,380
space before being returned to the exact moment
from which he had been taken. Years later, Mordo

301
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,660
resurfaced in South America, kidnapping a
politician to lure his daughter, the

302
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:59,380
Mune...Monee...Saint Kroy, so he could siphon
her life energy to sustain himself. Monee tricked

303
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:04,560
Mordo into thinking he had been cured and allowed
him to leave, deluded. Not long after, Mordo

304
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:10,660
appeared to die in Brazil, slain by Thor's
enchanted axe, but his body later vanished. Mordo

305
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:16,720
reemerged during the period when the Empirical, a
fanatical science cult, purged magic from Earth.

306
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:21,740
Having survived by pledging himself once more to
Dormammu, he attacked a weakened Dr. Strange in

307
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:26,700
New York, briefly overpowering him before
Strange was abducted by the villain Nightmare.

308
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,440
Mordo and Dormammu clashed again, and when
Dormammu attempted to destroy Strange, Mordo

309
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,180
added his power to his old foes, helping banish
Dormammu to Shumagorath's realm. Despite this

310
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:42,480
uneasy alliance, Mordo quickly turned on
Strange, and was defeated once more. When Hydra

311
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,920
seized control of the United States, a
dark-forced dome enclosed Manhattan. Baron

312
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:52,180
Mordo was appointed caretaker of the city and
occupied the Sanctum Sanctorum, where he

313
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:57,980
enslaved the Elder God Pooorg as his guardian. He
captured several heroes, including Daredevil,

314
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:03,500
Luke Cage, and Iron Fist, but lost control when Dr.
Strange, Spider Woman, Ben Uruk, and Kingpin

315
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:08,420
rallied against him and reclaimed the Sanctum.
Following these events, Mordo continued serving

316
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:14,320
Dormammu's race, the Valtines, as an enforcer. In
this role, he destroyed the demon Barashtak and

317
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:19,260
freed Strange's former apprentice, Casey
Kinmont, corrupting her with dark power and

318
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:24,780
sending her against her mentor. After Strange
restored Casey's soul, she banished Mordo back to

319
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:29,740
the Void where he remains, alive, scheming, and
eternally plotting vengeance against the

320
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,920
Sorcerer Supreme. And that is Baron Mordo's
backstory. Powers-wise, Baron Mordo has access

321
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:39,740
to a near-limitless number of spells and
abilities. Through magic, he can project mystic

322
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:44,980
energies as powerful bolts or protective
shields. He can read and cast thoughts, cast

323
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:51,360
illusions, and hypnotize. He can teleport and
fly. He can also turn invisible and intangible,

324
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,380
and project an incorporeal copy of himself called
his astral form. Mordo can transmute matter,

325
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:03,060
war-priality, and materialize objects. He has
limited time control abilities such as slowing,

326
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:08,220
freezing, and even traveling through time. Also,
he can invoke extra-dimensional deities for any

327
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:13,340
number of spells and often utilize his black
magic, including necromancy, the magic of the

328
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:18,500
dead. Baron Mordo is an expert in the occult and is a
skilled martial artist, having been trained by

329
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:24,600
Tibetan monks. He has occasionally carried or
manifested a dagger for ritual sacrifice. And

330
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,120
there you go. The whole time I was listening to that
backstory, I was like, Are you looking off my

331
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:35,000
sheet? Because there are a lot of similarities
between Baron Mordo and Felix Faust. It makes

332
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,320
sense, because Felix Faust is a total ripoff of
Baron Mordo. I'm sorry, what? Felix Faust came out

333
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:48,960
in 1962, my friend. Well, Baron Mordo came out in
1963. Exactly! Dammit! Let me get into Felix

334
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:55,260
Faust's backstory. Felix Faust was an ancient
sorcerer whose recorded history dates back to

335
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:03,400
around 5000 BC, when he rose within the African
Empire of Kor. There, the realm's ruler, King

336
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:09,389
Namo, served as both monarch and guardian of the
mystical Flame of Life, a source of

337
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:15,500
near-limitless magical energy. Obsessed with
seizing that power, Faust delved into forbidden

338
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:21,949
rites, mastered the dark art of black magic, and
summoned legions of shadow spirits to wage war

339
00:34:21,949 --> 00:34:28,540
against Namo's kingdom. His sorcery poisoned the
skies and drained the land, but Namo absorbed the

340
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:34,760
Flame into himself, turning its power inward to
banish Faust's soul to another dimension. For

341
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:41,409
millennia, Faust's disembodied spirit endured
imprisonment, sustained only by its hatred and

342
00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:48,929
hunger for lost magic. In the 1920s, an occultist
named Dekan Drake uncovered records of Faust's

343
00:34:48,929 --> 00:34:54,889
confinement and sought to release him, believing
he would be rewarded with power. When Drake opened

344
00:34:54,889 --> 00:35:01,560
the dimensional gate, Faust devoured his soul and
possessed his body. Though restored to life,

345
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:08,020
Faust's magic was greatly reduced, forcing him to
rely on familiars, grimoires, and packs with

346
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:13,800
demons to channel power. Determined to reclaim
his former strength, he spent decades hunting

347
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:20,260
cursed relics and manipulating occult
societies. Over time, he fathered two children,

348
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:26,320
Sebastian and Fauna, both born with traces of his
arcane lineage. In his relentless pursuit of

349
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:32,020
power, Faust later attempted to sacrifice
Sebastian's soul to the demon Nibiros, but the

350
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:38,100
ritual backfired and beowing his son with magical
abilities of his own. Faust sought to regain his

351
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:45,060
lost abilities by summoning and controlling the
demons three. Abnegazar, Wrath, and Gast,

352
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:50,850
ancient reality-warping entities imprisoned
beneath the earth. To gather the relics that bound

353
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:57,860
them, the red jar of Calythos, green bellow Uthul,
and silver wheel of Nyarlath, he magically

354
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:03,520
enslaved the Justice League to retrieve them.
Once freed, the demons turned on Faust, and

355
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:09,240
Aquaman destroyed the spell's control circle,
ending the attempt and sending Faust to prison.

356
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:15,740
Over time, Faust's reliance on infernal power
deepened. He repeatedly sold and repurchased his

357
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:22,450
soul, each deal eroding his power further. In
desperation, he attempted to deceive Miron,

358
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:28,680
ruler of Hell, by offering an innocent girl's soul
instead of his own. Miron sought through the trick

359
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:34,120
and condemned him to a dimension reserved for
magicians who abused the laws of magic. After

360
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:40,560
centuries of torment, Faust escaped back to
earth, his sanity and power both unstable. He

361
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:45,390
returned to prominence as an enemy of the Justice
League and as an ally of various villainous

362
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:50,860
factions, including the Injustice Gang and the
Seeker Society of Supervillains, serving as

363
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:56,430
their arcane specialist. During this period, his
strained relationship with his son Sebastian

364
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:03,100
escalated. When Sebastian joined the outsiders,
Faust sent demonic agents to capture him, and in

365
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:08,860
the ensuing conflict, he recovered two of the
demon 3's relics, but Halo and Looker destroyed

366
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:13,600
them before he could harness their power. You can
learn more about the outsiders in their duel

367
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:20,020
against X-Force. Faust's ambitions reached
their peak in a ritual known as the Black Baptism.

368
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:25,890
He assembled infernal covens across the globe to
siphon the life-horse of Earth's magicians into a

369
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:32,220
single rite that would reset all magic under his
control. Demon assassins abducted mystics

370
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:38,000
including Zatana and Deadman to power the
ceremony. The Justice League, aided by Blue Devil

371
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:44,180
and Sebastian Faust, disrupted the ritual. At its
height, Felix attempted to absorb the captured

372
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:49,980
souls, but Sebastian severed the conduit,
collapsing the spell. The backlash stripped

373
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:55,700
Faust of his stolen power and scattered his
followers, forcing him back into hiding. Years

374
00:37:55,700 --> 00:38:01,680
later, Faust resurfaced posing as Dr. Fates,
attempting to deceive a long-aided man into

375
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:07,350
trading his soul to Niran in exchange for
resurrecting his wife. Ralph Dibney saw through

376
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:14,140
the ruse and reversed the trap, binding both Niran
and Faust inside the Tower of Fates. Faust

377
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:20,060
eventually escaped, but his reputation amongst
occult circles fell even lower. You can learn more

378
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:26,140
about elongated man in Our Elongated Man vs Medusa
Duel episode. Following his escape, he allied

379
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:32,160
with Professor Ivo, Solomon Grundy, and Dr.
Impossible, posing as Deadman to trick Red

380
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,080
Tornado into inhabiting a human body, while
stealing the android's original shell for

381
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:42,640
experimentation. Faust later joined Talia El
Ghul and Cheetah in an attempt to recruit Black

382
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:48,660
Alice into the Seeker Society of Supervillains.
When she refused, she turned his own power against

383
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:55,000
him, using it to resurrect her mother. During
Black Adam's quest to revive his wife Isis, Faust

384
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:00,760
interfered again, replacing Isis' bones with
those of Ralph Dibney to sabotage the

385
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:06,890
resurrection spell. He later revived the real
Isis himself and held her captive until she broke

386
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:12,310
free. You can learn more about Black Adam in his
duel against Apocalypse. Faust remained aligned

387
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:17,700
with the Seeker Society assisting in the creation
of the android known as Genocide by collecting the

388
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:23,450
mystical elements needed for her construction.
After the Flashpoint reset, Faust's history was

389
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:31,040
rewritten. He was reimagined as the son of Majika,
one of Earth's first sorcerers and an heir to a long

390
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:37,620
lineage of dark magicians. In the 1500s, he allied
with Vandal Savage and trained an apprentice

391
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:43,040
named Aurora, pursuing immortality through
forbidden magic. During this period, he

392
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:48,180
encountered time-traveling heroes Robin and
Superboy, who disrupted one of his rituals and

393
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:54,700
forced him to retreat. In the modern era, Faust
became obsessed with finding the books of magic, a

394
00:39:54,700 --> 00:40:00,960
compendium set to contain all arcane knowledge.
To acquire the secrets of the damned sorcerer Nick

395
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:08,220
Necro, Faust sold his soul to a demon trading his
mortality for Necro's power. The pact granted him

396
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:14,390
vast new abilities but left his body pale and
corpse-like. Together with Nick Necro and Dr.

397
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:20,060
Mist, he sought to seize the books of magic from the
Justice League Dark. Their scheme was undone by

398
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:25,870
John Constantine and Faust was captured by Argus
and confined within their Black Room facility.

399
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:30,580
You can learn more about the Justice League Dark
and John Constantine and their respective duels

400
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:35,860
against the Midnight Suns and Brother Voodoo.
During the crime syndicate's invasion, Faust was

401
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:41,890
conscripted alongside Necro to construct a
magical weapon called the Thaumaton, designed to

402
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:47,660
harness and destroy divine energy. Working
beside Enchantress, Sargon the Sorcerer, Blue

403
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:53,620
Devil, and Zatana, Faust helped power the device
until the Justice League Dark sabotaged it in a

404
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:59,140
battle at Nanda Parbat, leaving him powerless
once more. Faust later reappeared among the

405
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:04,120
Occult Underworld when industrialist Henry
Bendix attempted to hire sorcerers to kill

406
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:10,430
Midnighter and Apollo. He declined the offer,
unwilling to serve others' agendas. His powers

407
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:16,460
gradually returned and his ghastly form faded.
The extra-dimensional entities known as the

408
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:23,120
Otherkind began consuming magical beings, Faust
was among their victims. Bound nearly mindless by

409
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:28,140
Zatana and Wonder Woman, he regained just enough
awareness to reveal a clue to the Sorcerer

410
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:34,700
Mordor's location, reverie trading again into
obscurity. That's Faust's backstory so far.

411
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:42,040
Powers-wise, Felix Faust is a master sorcerer
with expertise in soul magic, necromancy, and

412
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:47,360
infernal packs. His abilities include
spellcasting, energy projection, elemental

413
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:53,280
manipulation, illusion, telepathy,
teleportation, and summoning entities such as

414
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:59,660
the Demon's Three. He can bind, transfer, or
resurrect souls, create magical constructs, and

415
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:06,320
scry across great distances. Faust's power is
largely drawn from external sources, like

416
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:11,560
familiars, relics, grimoires, or demonic
patrons, due to the degradation of his natural

417
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:18,080
magic reserves. He is vulnerable to pure divine
magic and cannot safely channel it without a

418
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:24,900
medium. Though physically frail, he compensates
with defensive wards, decoys, escape spells, and

419
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:33,260
other occult resources. That's Felix Faust. What
a coward. Uh, it fucking works, kinda. Like Baron

420
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,930
Mordo, he doesn't have the greatest history of
success. That's the problem with villains and

421
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:41,740
their backstories. It just turns into a long
string of failures over time because the hero

422
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:47,040
always wins. Pfft, lame. But villains should not
be discounted, or at least Baron Mordo shouldn't

423
00:42:47,040 --> 00:43:11,960
be. And especially Felix Faust. Mike Podcast

champions clash every Thursday. Join us as we
speculate on the matches and armed with the power

427
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:37,400
of mathematical simulations discover who will
emerge victorious. Visit dynamicpodcast.com,

428
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:45,320
where we settle the debate and settle the score.
But now that we've got their histories and

429
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:51,160
abilities out of the way, let's speculate on how
one of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The

430
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:55,880
winner is determined by simulations, not this
speculation. But it's fun to imagine how this

431
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:02,020
fight could play out. AJ9K, what are the rules of
our speculation? Well, I should say there are no

432
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:07,000
rules. Other than the characters have no prior
knowledge of the other going into the fight. All

433
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,080
they are aware of starting out is that the other
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.

434
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:17,300
For the speculation, the contestants will begin
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript

435
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:22,400
environment that will have no bearing on the match
itself, as no environmental statistics are

436
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:27,520
considered in my simulations. The contestants
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright

437
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:33,680
then, let's get into it. Felix Faust and Baron
Mordo meet on the battlefield. Who goes first? You

438
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:38,100
always go first, so I'm going to go first this time.
Baron Mordo is going to start off by pulling out

439
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:44,500
this dagger from his cloak, and he drags it across
the palm of his hand, drawing blood, and that's

440
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:50,000
going to summon this giant tentacle that erupts
from the ground beneath him. It's going to be like

441
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:56,260
20 yards long, and it just smacks the shit out of
Felix Faust, sending him flying across the floor

442
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:02,230
and breaking all of his ribs. Alright, well if you
have a dagger, I'm going to say Felix Faust at least

443
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:09,180
has a small grimoire that floats in his hand. So as
that tentacle is coming out of the ground, Faust's

444
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:14,400
book is going to flip to a specific page that he's
going to read from, and it's going to ignite that

445
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:20,060
tentacle on fire and cause it to screech in pain and
then just return back to the ground. And once it

446
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:25,580
does that, Faust flips to another page, and
recites a spell that causes Baron Mordo's dagger

447
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:32,480
to melt and it just slips out of his grasp into a
puddle on the ground. Okay, so the dagger becomes a

448
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:39,000
puddle. We'll say like the puddle's the size of a
manhole cover, and Mordo casts a spell on it, and

449
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,520
out of this puddle leaps this silver skeleton
who's holding a sword, like a cutlass, and then

450
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:52,160
like five more skeletons pop out of this puddle,
and all six of them charge at Felix Faust and just

451
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:58,200
stab his ass repeatedly. Okay, but Faust, he's
going to counter with a spell on his own shadow

452
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:06,280
that's going to cause it to duplicate, and from the
shadows emerge these dark like magic Faust clones

453
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:11,940
that are all going to blast the silver skeletons
with these eldritch fireballs, and that's going

454
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:18,560
to make those bones scatter all over the
environment. Okay, but Mordo is going to compress

455
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:25,340
all of these shadow clones into a shadow ball of
like dark energy, and it's going to continue to

456
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:30,900
press until it becomes like this magical
singularity, like a black hole that pulls Faust

457
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:39,180
into it and sends them to like this dark dimension
of pain and spikes, like an iron maiden dimension

458
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:46,000
where he's pierced for the rest of eternity.
Actually, Faust divined from the scattered

459
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:52,800
silver skeleton bones that Mordo was going to
attempt to put him into a dark dimension. So he was

460
00:46:52,800 --> 00:47:00,800
prepared. He just turned invisible and from his
cloak, he pulled out this small doll that grew in

461
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:07,280
size and that got sucked into the dark dimension
instead. And each time that doll gets pierced,

462
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:13,680
it's actually Mordo that feels the pain because
it's like a voodoo doll. Okay, well, once Mordo

463
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:20,270
starts feeling the spikes from this voodoo doll,
he's going to pull out of his cloak a tarot card and

464
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:27,380
it's basically the same thing as like a magic Uno
reverse card. So instead of Mordo feeling pain

465
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:32,580
from getting pierced, it's Faust because the
voodoo doll now represents Faust and Faust is

466
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:39,580
getting poked and it causes him to drop out of his
invisibility. Shit. Okay. Well, once Faust

467
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:48,860
starts to feel the piercings of his flesh, he
telekinetically positions the doll within the

468
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:57,240
spike dimension so that it's pierced in a specific
way, like a stigmata combined with his chakra

469
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:03,240
points. And that's actually going to amplify his
power. So with these glowing lines connecting

470
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:09,600
these pierced points on his body, this third eye is
going to appear glowing on his forehead. And from

471
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:16,740
it, he shoots this massive sized beam of magic
energy straight at Mordo. And this can't be Uno

472
00:48:16,740 --> 00:48:22,200
reversed, by the way, because the card gets
destroyed. Well, wouldn't destroying an Uno

473
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:28,840
reverse card just destroy yourself? No, because
it's like a draw for wild type of counter magic

474
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:36,680
energy. Shit. Okay. So the card gets destroyed.
Mordo gets knocked down from the blast, but he

475
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:42,460
manages to quickly throw up a magic shield. That's
like in the shape of this mouth, like a fanged mouth

476
00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:50,000
that feeds on Faust's third eye energy. It's going
to absorb it and feed it back to Mordo. And this

477
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,180
absorption is going to drain Faust. It's going to
turn him into like this desiccated corpse. And

478
00:48:55,180 --> 00:49:00,620
like his soul just gets sucked right out of his
third eye. And then he falls to the ground, just

479
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:06,860
dead. And Mordo is like glowing with all this red
evil energy that was fed to him. Well, that's funny

480
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:13,160
that you think Faust needs his soul. So Faust's
body falls to the ground and splatters,

481
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:19,380
basically. And it's going to get absorbed into the
earth. But suddenly from beneath Mordo,

482
00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:26,880
thousands of these tiny human veins and arteries
quickly spurt from the ground and cover him in like

483
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:33,680
a net. And that's going to leech into a skin and that
glowing red energy suddenly turns black as

484
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:41,120
Mordo's magically poisoned. And slowly his
facial features are going to turn into that of

485
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:48,000
Felix Faust, who is taking over Mordo's body. And
since he's the last one standing, he wins the duel.

486
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:54,320
Well, I think Baron Mordo would realize that he's
being magically poisoned by these veins and

487
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:59,940
arteries from the ground. So he's going to drink a
potion that he pulls from his cloak and it's going

488
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:06,620
to cure him of his magic poison. And he just pukes up
Faust, who's just this like gross pile of biomass

489
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:15,100
on the ground. And therefore Mordo wins. No, but
this biomass is going to grow Faust's head and like

490
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:21,020
a semblance of a human body, like like the creature
from the thing. OK. And from that creature's body

491
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:29,380
emerges a bell, wheel and a jar, which are going to
summon the demons three. And under Faust's will,

492
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:37,160
they're going to reshape reality so that Baron
Mordo's mind like inverts itself, revealing his

493
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:43,920
darkest secrets and fears. And he's going to live
out eternity tormented by his own nightmares. So

494
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:50,020
Faust wins. That's that's some dark shit, kind of
like a nightmare that Felix Faust wakes up from

495
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:56,540
because this whole battle was just a hypnotic
illusion that Felix Faust was experiencing while

496
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:02,730
in reality he's bleeding out from being
sacrificed by Baron Mordo to Dormammu. Really,

497
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:07,960
you're going to pull the whole it was all a dream.
Yep. Baron Mordo sacrificed Felix Faust to

498
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,920
Dormammu. And that's what really happened. I
guess we can leave it there. Either that happens or

499
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:18,270
we don't take the lazy way out and Felix Faust
actually traps Baron Mordo and his own

500
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:23,770
nightmarish hell. Let's leave the match there and
put the stats run the simulations and come back

501
00:51:23,770 --> 00:51:30,820
with a winner. A G9K hit it. Inputting data,
running calculations, processing results,

502
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:35,840
simulations complete. All right. I mentioned
earlier that these characters had similar

503
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:42,800
backstories and it's not really any surprise they
had very similar stats. They're basically the

504
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:48,880
same character, like speed, versatility,
invasiveness, durability, perception,

505
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:55,640
intellect, strength, range, damage, their
feats, their stats were all exactly the same. They

506
00:51:55,640 --> 00:52:03,600
differed in one category, however, and that was
fighting skill. Surprisingly, Felix Faust is one

507
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:11,520
of the weakest fighters in DC, whereas Baron Mordo
does not really fight, but it is established

508
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:17,320
canon. And this is reflected on Marvel's official
power grid stats for him that he has some fight

509
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:22,360
training from Tibetan monks. Considering that,
Jonathan, tell me who you think is winning this

510
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:29,980
match. It's of course going to be close. I can only
pray for a statistical miracle, essentially. I

511
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:37,500
will say that Instagram thinks that Felix Faust is
going to win. 60% of them voted in his favor in our

512
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:43,340
Instagram poll. Well, I think that's just a bunch
of DC fans on Instagram jumping on the bandwagon

513
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:50,180
because DC has won a few recently. They're going to
learn today. They might not going to lie. Well,

514
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:56,300
let's find out. HG9K, the results, please. Hey,
you are, sir. All right. The winner between Felix

515
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:09,300
Faust and Baron Mordo is Baron motherfucking
Mordo. Yeah. Congratulations. You're going to

516
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:19,100
stay married. Oh, I can't wait to show my wife this
episode. She'll finally respect you again. Can I

517
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:24,820
just say how stupid it is that it came down to the
fighting stat? Well, I mean, if they're going tit

518
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:30,040
for tat through all their thousand battles, at
some point things might turn physical because

519
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:35,320
they've exhausted everything else. And I don't
mean in that way. I mean, like a physical fight. And

520
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:40,060
if it comes down to that, yeah, Baron Mordo is going
to take it. But really, I don't see it coming down to

521
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:45,380
that very often. I guess in approximately like 37
matches or so out of the thousand. Wait, what were

522
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:53,160
the win percentages? Oh, yeah. Baron Mordo won 537
matches out of a thousand, whereas Felix Faust won

523
00:53:53,160 --> 00:54:01,620
463. So it was 53.7 percent over 46.3 percent. OK,
so pretty close. Not surprised. Not close enough.

524
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:07,040
DC just can't hang with how awesome Marvel is. It's
embarrassing. You should be embarrassed for this

525
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:13,020
loss. I hope you are along with all DC fans. Marvel
fans, go ahead and pat yourselves on the back. You

526
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:18,230
did it. You did it this time. Yeah, this time this
time you got lucky. Yeah, Marvel fans getting

527
00:54:18,230 --> 00:54:28,880
lucky. Unlike DC fans, fucking virgins. Not that
there's anything wrong with that. H &K, help close

528
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:53,500
us out. Spotify, Podchaser or on our website.
Don't forget to listen to the other shows in the

529
00:54:53,500 --> 00:55:00,880
Dynamite podcast network, including Max
Destruction, Senjo World and Console Combat. In

530
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:07,120
our next episode, Continuing Spooktober, we will
be pitting the lords of the underworld against

531
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:12,940
each other, Nieran versus Hella. That'll be a good
one. I'm looking forward to that. And the episode

532
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:17,040
following that, which will be our Halloween duel,
which will keep a secret until our next episode.

533
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,560
But that does it for this one. We want to give a big
thanks to our executive producers, John

you guys next week. Up up and away, true believers.

538
00:55:42,140 --> 
Honestly, I tried to bring that Uno draw four wild
card energy into daily life.
