This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,353
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:28,713 --> 00:00:33,358
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based

4
00:00:33,418 --> 00:00:38,723
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother Johnny DC. And in this episode

5
00:00:38,763 --> 00:00:44,208
we are doing another duel, this time it's the
general against Red Hulk. And this of course

6
00:00:44,248 --> 00:00:49,333
is in lead up to our review of Captain America
Brave New World, which comes out in theaters

7
00:00:49,373 --> 00:00:54,341
this Friday. I got my tickets, I'm gonna go
see it on Valentine's Day and it's gonna be

8
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:59,886
a Valentine's date and it's gonna be the best
date with my wife. Nothing like working on

9
00:00:59,926 --> 00:01:04,150
Valentine's Day. Reviewing is not work to me,
it's a passion, it's a passion, so I don't

10
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:09,435
consider it work. Now it's totally work for
me to sit through a Marvel movie. Good. Okay.

11
00:01:09,455 --> 00:01:15,280
I'm glad, I don't know. But we're gonna run
the stats on these two characters later on

12
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,083
in the episode and find out who will win. Before
that, we're gonna break down the latest comic

13
00:01:19,103 --> 00:01:24,507
book movie news to come out this past week of
which we got two trailers from Marvel. The

14
00:01:24,547 --> 00:01:29,251
first one being Fantastic Four First Steps,
the first official teaser, and we also got

15
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:34,655
a big game trailer for the Thunderbolts. I totally
thought we were gonna get a big game trailer

16
00:01:34,975 --> 00:01:40,580
for Superman. It's the whole reason I watched
the frickin' Super Bowl this year, and it did

17
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,264
not come up. Yeah, DC sucks too much. As always
guys, we list our segment times in our episode

to the No Prize! A No Prize is an award Marvel

41
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:56,110
used to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic
Duel No Prize, is a digital award that we post

42
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:01,172
on Instagram for the person we feel gave the
best answer to our question of the week. Last

43
00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:07,438
week, we asked, what is a cancelled Marvel or
DC television series that you most wish would

44
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:12,142
have gotten at least one other season. And this
question stemmed from the news that season

45
00:04:12,242 --> 00:04:18,307
two of The Sandman will be its final season.
We got five answers for this question. So let's

46
00:04:18,327 --> 00:04:23,212
go ahead and run down our three honorable mentions
and the no prize winner. Our first honorable

47
00:04:23,312 --> 00:04:31,499
mention goes to Scott Camacho, who said. One's,
two's here. If I have to pick out a show to

48
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:36,871
go off, it would be the Titans TV show. I liked
the direction it was going. It looked like

49
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:42,336
it was leading, probably introducing more characters
such as Blue Beetle, Damien Wayne. Loved the

50
00:04:42,356 --> 00:04:49,241
introduction of Superboy, almost becoming a
live-action Young Justice. Man, another show

51
00:04:49,261 --> 00:04:55,446
that I would have loved. Titans, Young Justice.
Yeah, with each subsequent season of Titans,

52
00:04:55,486 --> 00:04:59,650
I feel like the show is getting better and better.
It was initially hard for me to get on board

53
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:07,997
with the tone of the series, Wonder Girl like
Superboy. The show is just damn fun to watch.

54
00:05:08,397 --> 00:05:12,381
And I definitely agree that they ended it too
soon. Yeah, that was one of the series that

55
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:18,186
originated on the DC Universe app, if I remember
correctly, before moving over to HBO Max, which

56
00:05:18,226 --> 00:05:22,730
later became Max. The other show that debuted
on that platform was Doom Patrol, which I thought

57
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,475
was a better show, but both of those series
ended up quite solid, I think, by the end of

58
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:31,630
their run. Yeah, absolutely. And in regards
to Young Justice, That's definitely a show

59
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:36,872
that also needs to come back for another season.
It's definitely top tier DC animated fare.

60
00:05:37,252 --> 00:05:44,576
Great answer Scotty. Our next honorable mention
goes to Zozo who said, So a Marvel TV series

61
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:50,459
that I think deserves another season would be
the spectacular Spider-Man. Me personally,

62
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:55,601
I love that show. I grew up watching it. It's
the reason why I fell in love with Spider-Man.

63
00:05:56,661 --> 00:06:02,228
Um. We were missing a bunch of Spider-Man's
rogues. We didn't get Hobgoblin, Kingpin, Scorpion,

64
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:06,770
Carnage. And if we got another season, then
we could definitely fit those characters in.

65
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:12,132
All right, that's all I gotta say. Thank you.
Yeah, much like Young Justice, the spectacular

66
00:06:12,172 --> 00:06:17,434
Spider-Man animated series has a whole lot of
fans. It's widely considered probably the best

67
00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:21,396
Spider-Man animated series that's come out so
far, not counting your friendly neighborhood

68
00:06:21,416 --> 00:06:25,674
Spider-Man, which is still being released right
now. So time will tell on that one. But yeah,

69
00:06:25,694 --> 00:06:29,477
there was a lot of potential with Spectacular
Spider-Man, and it's a shame that it ended

70
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:33,801
when it didn't. Myself, I was always a bigger
fan of the 90's Spider-Man cartoon, but that's

71
00:06:33,821 --> 00:06:40,827
because I'm like an old ass millennial, and
I really wish that Disney would put out a Spider-Man

72
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:45,792
98 television series to compliment their X-Men
97 show. I don't think that'll happen, but

73
00:06:45,812 --> 00:06:50,956
in many ways, the 90's Spider-Man show walked
so that Spectacular Spider-Man could run, and

74
00:06:51,137 --> 00:06:56,240
it was fantastic, yeah. I never actually saw
a single episode of the Spectacular Spider-Man.

75
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:02,583
Well, then you can just stop talking. I was
just going to say that from the stills that

76
00:07:02,623 --> 00:07:07,606
I've seen from it though, it reminds me a lot
of the Batman animated series that came around

77
00:07:07,887 --> 00:07:12,569
like just after Batman Begins. Oh, the Batman.
Yeah. Yeah, there were some great cartoons

78
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:18,553
that came out in the 2000s for sure. Great answer
Zozo. Our final honorable mention goes to Travis

79
00:07:18,593 --> 00:07:23,439
Herndon, who said... What's up, dynamic dudes?
Travis here. Shout out to my evil twins. So

80
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:29,762
my answer had to be the MTV animated Spider-Man
series. Hands down, that means another season

81
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:35,724
to finish that story arc. Peter giving up being
Spider-Man, evil psychic twins that cause him

82
00:07:35,744 --> 00:07:40,827
to hurt his friend are still at large. That
means a conclusion. That story arc needs conclusion.

83
00:07:40,947 --> 00:07:46,229
Everybody will say spectacular Spider-Man or
something. No, MTV's Spider-Man needs a bigger

84
00:07:46,249 --> 00:07:53,220
conclusion than spectacular. And speaking of
2000s animated series, the MTV Spider-Man cartoon

85
00:07:53,340 --> 00:08:00,623
came off the back of the first Sam Raimi Spider-Man
movie. And the MTV Spider-Man cartoon was completely

86
00:08:00,683 --> 00:08:05,525
computer animated. The 3D character models were
not bad looking, but everything moved stiff

87
00:08:05,565 --> 00:08:10,847
as hell in hindsight. Back at the time, I thought
it was incredible. Like Spider-Man looked really

88
00:08:10,887 --> 00:08:14,929
fluid, swinging through the city and stuff like
that. It was a pretty stylized show that I

89
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:18,990
have a lot of nostalgia for, but I... Bet you
upon revisiting it, it wouldn't hold up quite

90
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,852
as well. Yeah, I loved the cast of that series.
Neil Patrick Harris as Peter Parker is still

91
00:08:23,892 --> 00:08:27,614
one of my top favorite voice performances for
the character to date. Plus you got some cool

92
00:08:27,634 --> 00:08:32,316
cameos and like Michael Clarke Duncan as Kingpin,
which was fun. Yeah, it was cool that they

93
00:08:32,336 --> 00:08:38,238
were kind of establishing a continuity of sorts
between this 3D animated cartoon and the films

94
00:08:38,258 --> 00:08:42,580
that were coming out at the time, right? Things
were starting to cross over in a way on TV

95
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,078
that they weren't quite able to do in the films
themselves. Really cool show. Thanks for the

96
00:08:47,118 --> 00:08:51,439
answer, Travis. And we want to give a quick
shout out to Matt Estes, who gave the answer

97
00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:57,521
of Inhumans. And while I would agree that an
Inhumans show would deserve many seasons, I

98
00:08:57,561 --> 00:09:01,342
think the Inhumans show is kind of fucked from
the get-go. I don't know if I want more seasons

99
00:09:01,382 --> 00:09:05,143
of that. I would rather just have them reboot
it. Yeah, the Inhumans deserve a show, just

100
00:09:05,223 --> 00:09:11,725
not that version of them. But the winner of
this week's snow prize is Lee Tapscott. Who

101
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:18,209
said? Lee Tapscott calling in about. which canceled
Marvel or DC TV series, I wish got another

102
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:27,238
season. 2016's NBC's Powerless, based in the
DC universe. This was about an insurance company

103
00:09:27,258 --> 00:09:33,684
that specialize in products to protect bystanders
from collateral damage of superheroes and supervillains.

104
00:09:34,044 --> 00:09:38,688
This was kind of like Marvel's damage control.
They only got one season, but it would have

105
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:44,184
been great to see more. Well, to my recollection,
they started out as a sort of insurance company,

106
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:48,947
but the show got retooled to be more of like
an engineering firm or something where they

107
00:09:48,967 --> 00:09:54,931
invent products. Yeah, it was products for people
who live in a world where superheroes destroy

108
00:09:54,971 --> 00:09:59,794
buildings and stuff like that. The series definitely
went through a bit of development hell, but

109
00:09:59,855 --> 00:10:06,279
the final product was hilarious. I owned the
first season, which was never fully released

110
00:10:06,379 --> 00:10:10,650
on television. There are a few episodes that
the public never got the chance to see. And

111
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:14,733
I gotta say, I would love to have seen more
episodes from this series. I would have loved

112
00:10:14,773 --> 00:10:19,838
to have seen more takes on various superheroes,
maybe obscure ones throughout the DC universe.

113
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:23,741
Yeah, I think they had the Crimson Fox show
up on the show. Right, yeah, and the Alpha

114
00:10:23,761 --> 00:10:28,905
Centurion. The cast was incredible. It was a
phenomenal ensemble that included Vanessa Hudgens

115
00:10:29,306 --> 00:10:33,950
and Ellen Tudyk and Danny Pooty. I still watch
some of the episodes from this series from

116
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:38,153
time to time whenever I need a good laugh. And
yeah, I would have loved more seasons of it.

117
00:10:38,662 --> 00:10:44,345
It was kind of like Parks and Rec set in the
world of DC, right? It didn't have that same

118
00:10:44,865 --> 00:10:49,748
documentary style feel to it. But I would argue
it was just as funny personally. Yeah, I think

119
00:10:49,988 --> 00:10:55,591
the show as a concept kind of got shed on because
superhero fans don't want comedies about their

120
00:10:55,631 --> 00:11:01,455
superheroes. But I disagree. I think this type
of show would have thrived in today's environment

121
00:11:01,475 --> 00:11:05,737
where superhero fatigue is kind of setting in
because Powerless gave us something unique

122
00:11:05,757 --> 00:11:09,749
and different at the time. Yeah, I didn't think
the show was gonna be nearly as good as it

123
00:11:09,789 --> 00:11:13,773
was, or I didn't think I was gonna enjoy it
as much as I did, I should say. If you guys

124
00:11:13,793 --> 00:11:18,037
have never checked it out, I definitely recommend
watching Powerless. So great answer, Lee! You

125
00:11:18,058 --> 00:11:22,282
win this week's No Prize. If you're the listener,
want a shot at winning your own No Prize. Stay

126
00:11:22,302 --> 00:11:26,567
tuned to later on in this episode when we'll
be asking another question of the week. And

127
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:28,669
now that that's done, on to the news!

128
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:39,233
All right, this past week we got two trailers
from Marvel Studios, the first one being the

129
00:11:39,393 --> 00:11:45,337
official teaser for Fantastic Four First Steps.
Now we've got brief glimpses of the film from

130
00:11:45,397 --> 00:11:50,741
last year during San Diego Comic-Con, but the
release of this teaser was the general public's

131
00:11:50,781 --> 00:11:56,825
first glimpse at the film, and I think it probably
surprised a lot of people who weren't already

132
00:11:56,865 --> 00:12:01,908
familiar with the creative direction that the
film was taking. The film takes place in an

133
00:12:02,028 --> 00:12:08,387
alternate universe, everything looks very dated.
It probably doesn't look like how a lot of

134
00:12:08,407 --> 00:12:12,768
people wanted the Fantastic Four movie to look
where the costumes look like how John Krasinski's

135
00:12:12,788 --> 00:12:17,629
did in Multiverse of Madness. You know, here
the costumes are light blue with the white

136
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:22,551
trim and everything like that. So I don't know,
I think there was just a misalignment of expectations,

137
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:27,992
but I gotta say that I really do like the bold
creative choices that Marvel is taking with

138
00:12:28,012 --> 00:12:33,587
this franchise because it really harkens back
to the origins of the characters, you know,

139
00:12:33,747 --> 00:12:39,292
as they were presented in the 1960s by Stan
Lee and Jack Kirby. I think it's an interesting

140
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:44,096
angle to take the characters and it's something
new and unique in a genre that we're not seeing

141
00:12:44,116 --> 00:12:51,622
a whole lot of new stuff from. So to see this
60s retro futuristic style, I think is an apt

142
00:12:51,882 --> 00:12:55,925
approach for the Fantastic Four. Like if you
look at the design of the Baxter building,

143
00:12:56,418 --> 00:13:00,019
That's pretty cool as hell. I really like the
look of the fantastic car too. Even though

144
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:03,339
it drives on the street, which is weird, I'm
assuming that at some point the wheels are

145
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:07,481
gonna lift up and we're gonna see it fly. Yeah,
I like the design of Herbie. I really dig the

146
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:13,302
aesthetic of this movie so far. Herbie was interesting.
I like his like data tape eyeballs. Right,

147
00:13:13,382 --> 00:13:17,063
yeah. Just the design of him looks really cool.
I gotta say, I wasn't a huge fan of the scene

148
00:13:17,103 --> 00:13:22,285
that he was in with the thing. No. They spent,
I swear to God, like 45 seconds on just the

149
00:13:22,305 --> 00:13:27,914
thing and Herbie talking about cooking. And
I feel like that was only an Easter egg for

150
00:13:27,934 --> 00:13:32,936
fans of the Bear television series. Like they
wouldn't have done that if it wasn't for Cousin

151
00:13:32,996 --> 00:13:38,357
from that show played by Eben Moss Bachrock
also playing the thing in this movie. I liked

152
00:13:38,397 --> 00:13:41,838
Herbie in that scene. I did not like really
anything about the thing, though. I thought

153
00:13:41,858 --> 00:13:46,640
the CG was bad. I thought his voice is bad.
I guess his look is the most comic accurate

154
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,241
look of the thing with a huge beetle brow. But
everything else about him was not great, in

155
00:13:52,281 --> 00:13:56,907
my opinion. His voice did throw me off, I do
find myself wishing that he wasn't wearing

156
00:13:56,947 --> 00:14:01,309
that bulky sweater. It almost seems like he's
a little bit puffy and non-threatening, you

157
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:06,131
know? And maybe that's the point, because we
know that traditionally the Fantastic Four

158
00:14:06,211 --> 00:14:12,593
are beloved by the public and regarded as celebrity
heroes. But yeah, I do think that this design

159
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:18,756
of the Thing is the most comic accurate. That
being said, the comic accurate depiction of

160
00:14:18,796 --> 00:14:23,530
the Thing character does look a little bit more
cartoony in this regard, I think. You almost

161
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:27,373
think that maybe there could have been something
that felt grounded and believable and real

162
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:33,458
and tangible within this world. Nah, fans would
have complained if you did that. Maybe. I probably

163
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:38,162
would have complained. Yeah, what am I talking
about? I will consider myself a fan of this

164
00:14:38,202 --> 00:14:42,545
version of the thing. I'm just hoping that they
really deepen the voice and yeah, I can't wait

165
00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:47,049
to see the polished final look of the CGI effect.
You know what I think they went wrong with?

166
00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:55,051
You know how they made Mark Ruffalo's Hulk look
like Mark Ruffalo? Yeah. Michael Chiklis looked

167
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:59,694
like his version of the thing in that movie,
but I don't see anything of Eben Masbachraak

168
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:04,377
in this thing. You might be right. Like, if
you listen to our reviews of the Hulk movies,

169
00:15:04,397 --> 00:15:10,101
we conjectured that the reason that Mark Ruffalo's
Hulk is the most successful version of that

170
00:15:10,162 --> 00:15:15,745
CG character is because you can see the performance
of Mark Ruffalo within the animation. Same

171
00:15:15,785 --> 00:15:20,829
thing with Josh Brolin and the character of
Thanos. Hopefully, we'll be able to see more

172
00:15:20,889 --> 00:15:27,146
of Eben's performance within this design of
the thing. I never really liked his casting,

173
00:15:27,206 --> 00:15:32,711
but I do have to say Vanessa Kirby, at least,
as Sue Storm, seems to be absolute perfection.

174
00:15:33,172 --> 00:15:39,177
Dude, and the effect that they give her invisibility
powers with that slight like rainbow halo at

175
00:15:39,197 --> 00:15:43,761
the edge, almost like a bubble, like a soap
bubble, that was really cool. I really liked

176
00:15:43,781 --> 00:15:48,525
that effect. Cause it feels like she's actually
bending light in that regard. Right, exactly.

177
00:15:49,022 --> 00:15:52,564
I really like the fire effects on the human
torch. Those have always been pretty great

178
00:15:52,644 --> 00:15:57,206
in all the franchises that we've seen of the
Fantastic Four. We didn't see any of Mr. Fantastic's

179
00:15:57,226 --> 00:16:00,809
stretching powers though, which I thought was
a little bit of a disappointment, largely because

180
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:05,631
his power set and how he uses his powers has
always been really interesting to me. Yeah,

181
00:16:05,671 --> 00:16:09,214
seeing Mr. Fantastic's power would have been
cool. It would have been also cool to see some

182
00:16:09,254 --> 00:16:13,416
of Johnny's trademark humor. I agree, yeah,
he didn't get any lines in this trailer at

183
00:16:13,436 --> 00:16:17,042
all, which I thought was kind of weird. We just
got to see him like... I don't know, lounging

184
00:16:17,082 --> 00:16:20,844
around the house wearing an astronaut's outfit
or something, I don't know. And then falling

185
00:16:20,884 --> 00:16:25,005
back to Earth in like a slow-mo scene. I was
like, all right. Yeah, there were some interesting

186
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:30,428
shots toward the end of the teaser where we
see Galactus' arrival, where, you know, in

187
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:35,350
the comic books, as the Silver Surfer came in,
the Earth Devourer's arrival was heralded by

188
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:40,932
rocks and fire in the sky and things like that.
So they're being real true to the comic books

189
00:16:40,972 --> 00:16:45,222
when we see all of these like asteroids kind
of come again. And we get a shot of the big

190
00:16:45,242 --> 00:16:49,945
man himself from behind, really. We see his
shadow looming over Manhattan, and then we

191
00:16:49,965 --> 00:16:54,627
see the back of Galactus' head, but it's so
refreshing to actually see the character in

192
00:16:54,667 --> 00:17:00,330
live action as he is depicted in the comic books
and not just this space cloud that they did

193
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:04,973
in the old franchise. What do you think of the
final outfits for the Fantastic Four? They're

194
00:17:04,993 --> 00:17:09,458
revealed in this pretty cool shot where... The
team is on a sound stage, kind of reminiscent

195
00:17:09,478 --> 00:17:13,859
of like the Beatles on the Ed Sullivan show.
Again, these guys are treated like celebrities

196
00:17:14,139 --> 00:17:18,080
by the general public. But the costumes, as
I mentioned earlier, they don't look that modern,

197
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:22,462
right? How do you feel about that? Well, we've
seen art of these costumes before, so I wasn't

198
00:17:22,682 --> 00:17:28,143
totally surprised. I don't love them. I also
don't love that they're not all uniform. Like

199
00:17:28,163 --> 00:17:33,505
they each have slight differences to them. Yeah,
like Ben and Johnny have the white shoulders

200
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:39,403
and the arms. And Sue has like the white collar
area. whereas Reed's is mostly blue. Yeah,

201
00:17:39,423 --> 00:17:44,687
I don't love them, but I guess they're in keeping
with the whole style of this world. The movie

202
00:17:44,707 --> 00:17:49,750
comes out in theaters on July 25th, and you
can bet your sweet ass will be reviewing it

203
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:54,633
right here on this podcast. It'll be work, but
yeah, we'll review it. I actually can't wait

204
00:17:54,653 --> 00:17:59,657
to see it. I was a really big fan of this teaser.
But speaking of previews that I'm a big fan

205
00:17:59,717 --> 00:18:05,501
of, let's talk about the Thunderbolts big game
trailer. Now we've seen a few teasers and trailers

206
00:18:05,521 --> 00:18:10,436
come out for this movie. which debuts in just
a few months here, but I think this is the

207
00:18:10,496 --> 00:18:15,059
first time we got a clear indication of who
the villain is gonna be and what that is gonna

208
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:20,983
look like. Previously, we all assumed that the
Sentry was going to be a member of the Thunderbolts

209
00:18:21,023 --> 00:18:26,407
team, but here, we clearly see that he is the
main villain. And maybe it's just his void

210
00:18:26,467 --> 00:18:32,331
persona that is the villain, but we do see this
shadowy figure with a long flowing cape flying

211
00:18:32,371 --> 00:18:37,414
above Manhattan and essentially covering the
city in shadow, in his darkness. and turning

212
00:18:37,454 --> 00:18:41,778
people into shadows. Yeah, yeah, that was pretty
interesting. They're taking a very light and

213
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:46,462
dark visual approach to the Sentry's power set,
which makes sense because that's how it's depicted

214
00:18:46,482 --> 00:18:51,686
in the comic books. But seeing it in live action
is always interesting when you see a character's

215
00:18:51,866 --> 00:18:58,632
abilities for the first time like that. My guess
is that maybe like Bob Reynolds Sentry joins

216
00:18:58,832 --> 00:19:03,656
the Thunderbolts, but he goes comatose or something
and the void takes over. If you guys wanna

217
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:08,977
learn more about the Sentry, and his dark alter
ego, The Void, definitely listen to our General

218
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:14,442
Zod versus Sentry Duel episode. But with the
Sentry being the bad guy of this film, it begs

219
00:19:14,482 --> 00:19:20,888
the question, how the hell is this ragtag group
of super soldiers and spies going to defeat

220
00:19:21,308 --> 00:19:25,372
this guy who's essentially Superman? He has
the power of a thousand exploding suns, right?

221
00:19:25,392 --> 00:19:29,715
He's one of Marvel's most powerful characters.
What chance does this team have? Yeah, Yelena

222
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:33,938
literally says, all we do is punch and shoot.
And she's not wrong, but I mean, they also

223
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:38,380
have a few super soldiers on there. I like it
with someone who goes intangible. And someone

224
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:43,542
who can mimic the physical abilities of other
in Taskmaster. Although, seems like Taskmaster

225
00:19:43,702 --> 00:19:48,404
dies like really early in the movie because
the character is almost non-existent in any

226
00:19:48,444 --> 00:19:52,346
of the marketing material. Right, yeah, I would
not be surprised if the character dies. The

227
00:19:52,366 --> 00:19:56,887
more and more I see about this film, the more
I liken it to the Suicide Squad. Well, I think

228
00:19:56,907 --> 00:20:03,835
the analogs have been drawn a lot, but the concept
of a Suicide Squad Superman movie is quite

229
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:09,459
intriguing. I think it's really cool to see
Bucky take charge and stand up and lead this

230
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:14,962
team toward doing what's right and protecting
the city in a world where the Avengers are

231
00:20:14,982 --> 00:20:19,005
not really a thing anymore. Yeah absolutely
I really liked that actually for a character

232
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:23,568
who could have been Captain America in the MCU
and has been in the comics it was nice to see

233
00:20:23,608 --> 00:20:29,052
him take a lead role in a team dynamic like
this. I do feel like we'll need to start a

234
00:20:29,132 --> 00:20:34,827
Deadpool on these who's gonna come out alive
after this film. Like I'm not so sure about

235
00:20:34,887 --> 00:20:40,049
Red Guardian, not so sure about Ghost, not so
sure about US Agent. Oh yeah, didn't we do

236
00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:44,871
a Deadpool for the Suicide Squad film on Discord?
Yeah, I think we did, but I don't think anyone

237
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:50,413
was close to determining who actually survived.
Well, there are fewer characters in this movie,

238
00:20:50,473 --> 00:20:54,595
so we'll bring the Duel pullback and see who
gets it right. Thunderbolts comes out in theaters

239
00:20:54,675 --> 00:21:00,197
May 2nd, and you can bet your sweet ass we're
gonna be reviewing it on this podcast. Again,

240
00:21:00,697 --> 00:21:07,269
work. Yay. I'm also really looking forward to
the Thunderbolts. We got two great trailers

241
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:12,055
here. I'm super excited and thrilled with the
state of Marvel Studios. And that brings us

242
00:21:12,095 --> 00:21:13,337
to our question of the week.

243
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:23,575
Between the Fantastic Four teaser and the Thunderbolts
big game trailer, which got you more hyped

244
00:21:24,156 --> 00:21:29,321
and why? It's time to be a DC fan this week.
I'll say that. I don't know, I liked the Superman

245
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:35,868
trailer more than either of these personally,
but uh... You just wrong! No! You! But disregarding

246
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:39,852
the Superman trailer, we want to know which
of these two trailers got you most pumped to

247
00:21:39,892 --> 00:21:44,808
see that respective film. Record your answer

Be sure to answer before February 15th.

252
00:22:09,922 --> 00:22:14,027
But that does it for all the news for this episode,
so let's go ahead and move into our main event

253
00:22:14,187 --> 00:22:20,276
where we find out who would win in a fight between
the Justice League villain, the General, and

254
00:22:20,396 --> 00:22:24,021
the Hulk villain, turned anti-hero, Red Hulk.

255
00:22:39,106 --> 00:22:45,928
Alright, the General versus Red Hulk. We have
two big hulking brutes here going head to head

256
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:51,851
against each other, who coincidentally enough
used to be generals before they became rampaging

257
00:22:51,891 --> 00:22:58,313
monsters. Yeah, one of them is still literally
named the General. Which is quite a lack of

258
00:22:58,594 --> 00:23:05,296
imagination, I think, on behalf of DC. Oh, okay.
I'm sorry, what is Red Hulk's name again? Red

259
00:23:05,536 --> 00:23:12,439
Hulk? Alright, so one other thing these characters
have in common is that they both have horrible

260
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:17,761
names. I don't know which one's worse, honestly.
But they're both pretty cool characters. The

261
00:23:17,801 --> 00:23:23,164
General, as I understand it, is a Captain Adam
villain who moved on to being a Justice League

262
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:28,586
villain. Sort of, I guess you could say that.
Yeah, the General's name is General Wade Eilink,

263
00:23:28,646 --> 00:23:34,669
and he's actually appeared in quite a few DC
projects. Clancy Brown played him in the Arrowverse,

264
00:23:34,829 --> 00:23:38,490
and he did a really good job with that. But
as you'll see in the character's backstory,

265
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:43,433
later on he becomes a character very much like
the Hulk. So in a way, Red Hulk is kind of

266
00:23:43,453 --> 00:23:50,177
like a rip-off. Taking this major general character
in comics and turning them into the Hulk? Hmm.

267
00:23:51,438 --> 00:23:56,100
So what you're saying is that the general is
a rip-off of the Hulk is all I heard. What?

268
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,363
You heard me. I'm saying Red Hulk is a rip-off
of General. No, Red Hulk is a rip-off of the

269
00:24:01,403 --> 00:24:06,634
Hulk as well. But that's fine, because he's
called Red Hulk. Oh, he's an homage. That's

270
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:11,075
your argument? Yes, yes. Can't wait to break
down these characters and get into their backstories

271
00:24:11,095 --> 00:24:16,177
and powers, but to explain the methodology behind
our duels, let's go to our sentient duel simulator,

272
00:24:16,577 --> 00:24:22,239
Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K, tell our listeners
how you go about determining a winner in our

273
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:27,200
duel matchups. Yes, of course, sir. The way
I determine a winner between the contestants

274
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,642
is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations using
the characters' statistics. The Monte Carlo

275
00:24:32,662 --> 00:24:36,966
simulation is a probabilistic model used to
determine outcomes through random sampling.

276
00:24:37,406 --> 00:24:42,290
In this case, I randomised the statistics along
a normal distribution as a way to simulate

277
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:46,914
the many variables that can occur during battle.
The stat parameters are based on the official

278
00:24:46,974 --> 00:24:52,279
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters'
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat

279
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:57,843
categories are included such as range, damage
potential, versatility and perception in order

280
00:24:57,883 --> 00:25:03,273
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.
The results of the 1000 simulations provide

281
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:07,679
a percentage of wins for each character. The
contestant with the higher percentage is declared

282
00:25:07,699 --> 00:25:13,006
the victor, as they have a higher probability
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,

283
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:18,159
neither character should win 100% of the matches.
The comic book stories have shown that there's

284
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:23,123
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so
the confidence rate of my method falls in line

285
00:25:23,143 --> 00:25:27,747
with the precedents that have been established
in the source material. My mathematical simulations

286
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:32,932
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes

287
00:25:32,972 --> 00:25:38,957
tabulated for determination of the winner. Thanks
AJ9K! Before we run the simulations though,

288
00:25:38,977 --> 00:25:43,480
we like to break down each character's histories
and abilities before improvising a scenario

289
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:49,265
on how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations
would play out beat for beat. And it's my turn

290
00:25:49,285 --> 00:25:54,828
to go first with a DC character's backstory,
so let me tell you all about the general. Now,

291
00:25:54,868 --> 00:26:00,012
Wade Iolink was a four-star general in the United
States Army, a brilliant strategist known for

292
00:26:00,052 --> 00:26:05,356
his ruthless approach to warfare and his willingness
to sacrifice anything for the greater good.

293
00:26:05,756 --> 00:26:10,979
He oversaw the top secret Captain Atom project,
an experiment designed to create the ultimate

294
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:17,118
living weapon under the US military's control.
To achieve his goal, Eilink selected Nathaniel

295
00:26:17,258 --> 00:26:22,760
Adam, an Air Force officer falsely convicted
of a crime and sentenced to death. Eilink offered

296
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:28,941
Adam a choice, submit to an extremely dangerous
experiment in exchange for a presidential pardon

297
00:26:29,302 --> 00:26:34,823
or face execution. With no real alternative,
Adam agreed, and you can learn more about Captain

298
00:26:34,883 --> 00:26:41,365
Adam in our Captain Adam vs. Wonder Man episode.
The experiment, designed to bond alien silver

299
00:26:41,405 --> 00:26:48,088
shield metal to a human subject, exposed Adam
to a nuclear detonation. The resulting explosion

300
00:26:48,188 --> 00:26:54,331
hurled Adam nearly 20 years into the future,
during which time Eilink covered up the project's

301
00:26:54,371 --> 00:26:59,834
failure and continued his efforts to create
a super-powered soldier. His next experiment

302
00:26:59,914 --> 00:27:06,937
led to the creation of Major Force, a metahuman
under direct military control. Meanwhile, Eiling

303
00:27:07,077 --> 00:27:12,380
married Adam's wife and raised his children
as his own. When Adam finally reappeared in

304
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:18,003
the present as Captain Adam, Eiling manipulated
him into serving the government using the threat

305
00:27:18,043 --> 00:27:23,445
of keeping him from his family as leverage.
Eiling remained a key figure in the military's

306
00:27:23,525 --> 00:27:31,349
metahuman operations, overseeing various secret
classified missions. However, his influence

307
00:27:31,389 --> 00:27:37,453
suffered a critical blow when Captain Adam defied
orders, revealing military corruption and exposing

308
00:27:37,493 --> 00:27:43,818
the US government's unethical experiments. Disgraced
but undeterred, Eilink remained determined

309
00:27:44,138 --> 00:27:49,802
to maintain control over America's metahuman
assets. Eilink's career was cut short when

310
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:56,686
he was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor,
a fate he refused to accept. Unwilling to succumb

311
00:27:56,706 --> 00:28:02,630
to mortality, he devised a new plan, one that
would grant him both immortality and unstoppable

312
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:09,455
power. His solution lay in Shaggy Man, an artificial
life form designed by Professor Andrew Zagarian.

313
00:28:09,835 --> 00:28:15,639
The Shaggy Man was originally created as an
indestructible synthetic organism, constructed

314
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:21,983
from a newly engineered substance known as plastalloy
and enhanced with salamander DNA to allow for

315
00:28:22,063 --> 00:28:27,787
rapid regeneration. However, the experiment
went horribly wrong. The Shaggy Man grew into

316
00:28:28,448 --> 00:28:34,612
powerful mindless brute, immune to injury, and
capable of instantly regenerating from any

317
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:40,056
damage. The creature rampaged uncontrollably,
battling the Justice League multiple times

318
00:28:40,356 --> 00:28:45,900
before being captured and imprisoned, only to
return each time due to its immortality and

319
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:52,584
self-repairing physiology. Eiling saw the Shaggy
Man as key to his survival and deployed a military

320
00:28:52,624 --> 00:28:57,466
task force to recover the creature's inert body
from the depths of the Pacific Ocean where

321
00:28:57,506 --> 00:29:02,548
he was last contained. Despite interference
from Green Lantern and Aquaman, the military

322
00:29:02,588 --> 00:29:08,011
succeeded in retrieving the body, allowing Eiling
to transfer his mind into the Shaggy Man's

323
00:29:08,071 --> 00:29:14,254
body and abandon his cancer-ridden form. Now
reborn in an indestructible body, he shaved

324
00:29:14,314 --> 00:29:19,536
off the Shaggy Man's fur and renamed himself
the General. He launched an all-out assault

325
00:29:19,577 --> 00:29:25,140
on the Justice League, deploying the Ultramarine
Corps, a unit of genetically enhanced metahuman

326
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:30,803
soldiers under his command. Though the General
proved nearly unstoppable, the League recognized

327
00:29:30,843 --> 00:29:35,807
his tactical shortcomings in his new monstrous
form and exploited his diminished strategic

328
00:29:35,887 --> 00:29:41,170
focus, trapping him on a barren rock in the
solar system's asteroid belt between Mars and

329
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:46,433
Jupiter. Eiling remained trapped on the asteroid
for months before being rescued by the Queen

330
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:51,468
Bee. who you can learn more about in our Queen
Bee vs Spider-Roman episode. She recruited

331
00:29:51,508 --> 00:29:56,311
him into Lex Luthor's Injustice Gang, and the
General once again clashed with the Justice

332
00:29:56,351 --> 00:30:02,074
League, wielding massive ballistic weapons alongside
his immense physical power. During the battle,

333
00:30:02,315 --> 00:30:07,758
he attempted to activate a White Martian warship's
weapons to destroy Earth, but was stopped by

334
00:30:07,858 --> 00:30:12,821
Orion and his war dog, Sturmer, who tackled
him through an airlock, banishing him into

335
00:30:12,841 --> 00:30:17,846
the Phantom Zone. and you can learn more about
Orion in his duel against Silver Surfer. The

336
00:30:17,886 --> 00:30:22,893
details of his escape from the Phantom Zone
remain unknown, but he resurfaced once again,

337
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:27,522
becoming a high-ranking member of the Seeker
Society of Super-Villains. He fought alongside

338
00:30:27,642 --> 00:30:32,244
other metahuman criminals during the Battle
of Metropolis, one of the first major offenses

339
00:30:32,404 --> 00:30:38,007
in the Society's war against the heroes. Following
the Society's defeat, however, Eiland was captured

340
00:30:38,047 --> 00:30:44,430
and forced into the Suicide Squad, a gove team
of criminals sent on high-risk missions, which

341
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:49,392
you can learn more about in our Suicide Squad
vs. Defenders team duel. Though nearly impossible

342
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:55,175
to control, the General's regenerative abilities
made him an invaluable asset to Amanda Waller.

343
00:30:56,676 --> 00:31:01,737
betrayed the squad, revealing their mission
to their intended target. In response, Rig

344
00:31:01,757 --> 00:31:07,940
Flag activated a bomb implanted in Eiling's
brain, detonating it. Though his body regenerated,

345
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:13,942
the explosion impaired his memory, leaving him
with partial amnesia. Even after his betrayal,

346
00:31:14,222 --> 00:31:18,824
the General remained a member of the Suicide
Squad, participating in missions that led to

347
00:31:18,884 --> 00:31:24,419
events where Earth's worst criminals were exiled
to an alien planet. Following the Flashpoint

348
00:31:24,459 --> 00:31:30,629
event that reset DC's continuity, Wade Eiland
was reintroduced as a high-ranking US military

349
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:36,499
officer overseeing better human operations.
This version of Eiland retained his role as

350
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:42,287
a manipulative strategist. leveraging Captain
Adam's abilities for military purposes. Unlike

351
00:31:42,307 --> 00:31:47,450
his previous incarnation, however, this version
did not transfer his mind into Shaggy Man's

352
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:53,192
body. Instead, he focused on controlling and
weaponizing metahumans using major force to

353
00:31:53,232 --> 00:31:58,175
combat Firestorm and other rogue superhumans.
He remained a constant adversary to Captain

354
00:31:58,255 --> 00:32:03,497
Adam, seeing him as a dangerous asset that needed
to be contained and controlled. Elements of

355
00:32:03,557 --> 00:32:08,840
Eiling's original history were reintroduced,
though he remained primarily a military antagonist

356
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:13,983
rather than a physical combatant in Shaggy Man's
body. Though with this duel focusing solely

357
00:32:14,103 --> 00:32:18,706
as his incarnation as the General, that's the
version we're going with. Powers-wise, the

358
00:32:18,767 --> 00:32:23,830
General possesses superhuman strength, durability,
and stamina, allowing him to battle the likes

359
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:29,334
of Superman, Wonder Woman, and Martian Manhunter
simultaneously. His indestructible synthetic

360
00:32:29,374 --> 00:32:33,056
physiology, derived from the Shaggy Man's plast
alloy body and

361
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:45,104
almost instantly, even regrowing severed limbs.
He is immortal, requiring no food, water, rest,

362
00:32:45,304 --> 00:32:50,748
or oxygen, and his body is highly adaptable,
making him resistant to most forms of attack.

363
00:32:51,048 --> 00:32:56,852
He's surprisingly agile and fast and his enhanced
senses allow him to detect adrenaline in his

364
00:32:56,912 --> 00:33:03,016
enemy's sweat, making ambushes nearly impossible.
However, his intellect began deteriorating

365
00:33:03,216 --> 00:33:07,619
after transferring into the Shaggy Man's body,
reducing his tactical focus and making him

366
00:33:07,659 --> 00:33:13,761
more That's the General. Well jokes on you,
the Red Hulk doesn't sweat because all of his

367
00:33:13,781 --> 00:33:19,302
sweat immediately evaporates. No, but he could
smell the evaporated sweat. Okay, okay. I've

368
00:33:19,342 --> 00:33:23,683
always liked the General as a character. He
was always a special kind of bastard who you

369
00:33:23,723 --> 00:33:29,184
love to hate solely for the fact that not only
did he send Nathaniel Adam to die in the experiment,

370
00:33:29,244 --> 00:33:34,005
but then he also married his wife and became
a father to his kids. Yeah. Like, it's rare

371
00:33:34,025 --> 00:33:39,749
you see that kind of assholery in comics where
the antagonist makes things so personal. Right.

372
00:33:40,149 --> 00:33:44,892
Yeah, the general actually has a pretty special
place in my heart as a DC fan because when

373
00:33:44,912 --> 00:33:50,596
I first really started getting into reading
DC comics, it was during the Justice League

374
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:55,980
Grant Morrison run where Lex Luthor's and Justice
Gang of the general and Queen B and Prometheus

375
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:00,503
were the major villains. I think he's a really
cool character. Who would win in a fight between

376
00:34:00,743 --> 00:34:05,907
the general and Doomsday? Because they seem
almost identical. I would argue Doomsday just

377
00:34:05,947 --> 00:34:11,952
because of the sharp edges that he has. He would
basically smash the general into a pulp. Now

378
00:34:11,992 --> 00:34:17,717
the general will always regenerate, but the
general isn't smashing Doomsday into a pulp.

379
00:34:18,038 --> 00:34:22,161
So I would give the edge to Doomsday. That makes
sense. Maybe we'll run the stats on that. But

380
00:34:22,182 --> 00:34:28,247
you know who is smashing the general to a pulp
though? Not Red Hulk. That's right. Red Hulk.

381
00:34:29,428 --> 00:34:33,954
Let me go ahead and get into his backstory.
Born into a family with a long history of military

382
00:34:33,994 --> 00:34:38,776
service, Thaddeus Thunderbolt Ross was raised
with the expectation of following in the footsteps

383
00:34:38,836 --> 00:34:43,877
of his father and grandfather. As a young man,
he immersed himself in military history and

384
00:34:43,897 --> 00:34:48,818
developed his flying skills as a stunt pilot
at county fairs. He later attended the United

385
00:34:48,858 --> 00:34:53,960
States Military Academy at West Point, where
he graduated at the top of his class. Ross

386
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,761
quickly rose through the ranks of the military,
serving in multiple wars, and earning his nickname

387
00:34:58,921 --> 00:35:04,085
Thunderbolt. for his aggressive, fearless leadership
in battle. His troops admired his battlefield

388
00:35:04,125 --> 00:35:08,869
prowess, but he also gained a reputation for
being ruthless and unwavering in his commitment

389
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:14,234
to military objectives. Ross married Karen Lee,
the daughter of his commanding officer, and

390
00:35:14,254 --> 00:35:19,819
the two had a daughter, Betty Ross. After Karen's
untimely death when Betty was a teenager, Ross

391
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:24,383
was left to raise his daughter while balancing
his military career. Ross was also one of the

392
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:29,518
founding members of a secret initiative known
as Control. which was tasked with monitoring

393
00:35:29,578 --> 00:35:34,359
scientific advancements that could pose a threat
to national security. Ross continued to rise

394
00:35:34,399 --> 00:35:38,940
through the military's ranks, eventually attaining
the rank of general. His leadership in war

395
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,142
zones further cemented his reputation as a hard-nosed,
battle-hardened officer. However, his career

396
00:35:44,162 --> 00:35:49,643
trajectory changed when he was assigned to oversee
the Gamma Bomb Project, led by Bruce Banner,

397
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:54,745
at a desert base in New Mexico. Ross resented
Banner from the start, believing him to be

398
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:59,122
an unworthy weakling and a poor match for his
daughter Betty, who was drawn to the young

399
00:35:59,162 --> 00:36:04,964
scientist. Ross viewed military service as the
epitome of manhood and found Banner's intellectual

400
00:36:05,064 --> 00:36:10,247
and unassuming nature to be detestable. His
disdain for Banner only deepened when an accident

401
00:36:10,267 --> 00:36:14,949
during the Gamma Bomb test transformed Banner
into the Hulk, whom you can learn more about

402
00:36:15,189 --> 00:36:20,411
in his duel episode against Doomsday. Ross immediately
perceived the Hulk as a major threat and launched

403
00:36:20,451 --> 00:36:25,233
an aggressive campaign to either capture or
destroy the creature. He led numerous military

404
00:36:25,273 --> 00:36:30,600
assaults against the Hulk. overseeing the formation
of elite task forces such as the Hulkbusters.

405
00:36:31,141 --> 00:36:36,524
Despite his relentless pursuit, Ross continually
failed to subdue the Hulk, leading to increasing

406
00:36:36,544 --> 00:36:41,588
frustration and desperation. His obsession with
bringing down the Hulk strained his relationship

407
00:36:41,628 --> 00:36:46,751
with Betty, who remained loyal to Banner. Ross
recruited Major Glenn Talbot to his cause,

408
00:36:47,212 --> 00:36:52,135
hoping Talbot could both help eliminate the
Hulk and win Betty's affections. But Betty's

409
00:36:52,195 --> 00:36:59,299
love for Banner remained steadfast. Ross took
extreme measures, including forming uneasy

410
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:04,941
alliances with known supervillains such as the
Leader and Modoc, hoping their combined resources

411
00:37:04,981 --> 00:37:10,623
could finally eliminate the Hulk. He even made
multiple deals with the Abomination, a gamma-powered

412
00:37:10,703 --> 00:37:15,726
enemy of the Hulk, despite knowing the villain's
destructive tendencies. His increasing willingness

413
00:37:15,766 --> 00:37:20,668
to compromise military protocol for personal
revenge led to his eventual dismissal from

414
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:25,862
the service. His obsession reached a peak when
he crashed Betty and Bruce's wedding. armed

415
00:37:25,882 --> 00:37:30,966
with a gun, and shot and wounded Bruce's friend
Rick Jones in an attempt to prevent the marriage.

416
00:37:31,467 --> 00:37:37,112
The failed attempt led to him being institutionalized
under psychiatric care. Seeking a way to redeem

417
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:42,456
himself, Ross agreed to work with the international
espionage organization SHIELD on an experiment

418
00:37:42,496 --> 00:37:48,542
involving the electrical entity and Hulk villain
known as Zax. The procedure infused Ross with

419
00:37:48,562 --> 00:37:54,242
a portion of Zax's energy, temporarily granting
him superhuman abilities. However, the process

420
00:37:54,362 --> 00:37:59,364
also left him mentally unstable, and after a
battle with the Hulk, Ross was eventually returned

421
00:37:59,404 --> 00:38:04,446
to normal. His life took a tragic turn when
Betty was seemingly killed by radiation poisoning.

422
00:38:04,846 --> 00:38:09,908
Believing that Banner was indirectly responsible,
Ross reignited his hatred for the Hulk and

423
00:38:09,948 --> 00:38:15,010
resumed his vendetta. Around this time, the
Hulk was exiled from Earth by a secret coalition

424
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:20,693
of superheroes known as the Illuminati. With
the Hulk gone, Ross found himself directionless,

425
00:38:21,113 --> 00:38:25,690
falling into depression and alcoholism. His
downward spiral made him an easy target for

426
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:30,733
manipulation when he was approached by the Leader,
who promised him the power to finally defeat

427
00:38:30,753 --> 00:38:35,915
the Hulk in exchange for his cooperation. Desperate
to fulfill his life's mission, Ross agreed,

428
00:38:36,315 --> 00:38:42,277
faking his own death using an android duplicate
of himself known as a Life Model Decoy. Using

429
00:38:42,337 --> 00:38:47,319
radioactive gamma energy siphoned from the Hulk
and cutting edge genetic modifications, the

430
00:38:47,379 --> 00:38:53,054
Leader and Modok transformed Ross into the Red
Hulk. Unlike the original Hulk, The Red Hulk

431
00:38:53,114 --> 00:38:57,736
retained his intelligence, could absorb radiation
to increase his strength, and could control

432
00:38:57,776 --> 00:39:02,199
his transformation back into human form. As
the Red Hulk, Ross carried out missions for

433
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:07,122
the leader's think tank called the Intelligencia,
including the assassination of the Abomination

434
00:39:07,442 --> 00:39:12,104
and the destruction of a S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier.
However, Ross soon realized that the Intelligencia

435
00:39:12,124 --> 00:39:17,267
saw him as nothing more than a tool for their
own ends. Seeking to assert his independence,

436
00:39:17,707 --> 00:39:23,530
Ross turned against them and set out on his
own path. Ross fought some of the most powerful

437
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:28,613
beings in the Marvel universe, including Thor,
the Submariner, the Silver Surfer, and the

438
00:39:28,653 --> 00:39:33,776
Hulk who had returned to Earth. He later joined
the Offenders, a team assembled by an elder

439
00:39:33,796 --> 00:39:38,839
of the universe known as the Collector, to challenge
the Hulk's defenders. Despite his strength

440
00:39:38,859 --> 00:39:44,662
and tactical intelligence, the Red Hulk was
ultimately exposed as Thaddeus Ross. His downfall

441
00:39:44,702 --> 00:39:48,944
came when he attempted to seize control of the
United States government, believing himself

442
00:39:48,984 --> 00:39:54,247
to be the only one capable of leading the nation.
His plan was thwarted by the Hulk, who defeated

443
00:39:54,287 --> 00:39:59,009
him in battle and warned him that if he ever
reverted to his human form, his secret would

444
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:04,292
be exposed. After being imprisoned in Gamma
Base, Ross was eventually recruited by Steve

445
00:40:04,312 --> 00:40:09,695
Rogers to assist the Avengers. He played a key
role in dismantling the Intelligentea's scorched

446
00:40:09,755 --> 00:40:14,678
earth contingency plan and was later instrumental
in defending earth against the Serpent, the

447
00:40:14,738 --> 00:40:19,841
Norse god of fear. Ross also led a new incarnation
of the Thunderbolts team, a group of former

448
00:40:19,881 --> 00:40:25,151
villains turned heroes using them to clean up
the fallout from his previous actions. However,

449
00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:32,193
Ross's time as the Red Hulk came to an end when
an inte version of the Hulk, known as Doc Green,

450
00:40:32,633 --> 00:40:39,475
finally devised a cure to depower Gamma-irradiated
indiviDuels. After a grueling battle, Doc Green

451
00:40:39,515 --> 00:40:45,216
successfully injected Ross with the cure, reverting
him to human form. Stripped of his powers,

452
00:40:45,596 --> 00:40:49,977
Ross was arrested for deserting his country
and placed in a classified military prison.

453
00:40:50,442 --> 00:40:54,343
Although he was later presumed dead, it was
revealed that he had faked his death using

454
00:40:54,403 --> 00:40:59,064
another life model decoy. He secretly aided
Earth's heroes in their battle against Hydra's

455
00:40:59,084 --> 00:41:04,425
takeover of the United States, where he was
exposed but paroled for his efforts. He was

456
00:41:04,465 --> 00:41:09,467
captured by a secret group of shady political
influencers known as the Power Elite. Through

457
00:41:09,487 --> 00:41:14,928
their experiments, Ross regained his Red Hulk
transformation, albeit this time keeping his

458
00:41:14,988 --> 00:41:20,938
mustache and gray hair intact. Escaping captivity?
He resumed his shadow war against national

459
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:26,100
threats, once again operating from the shadows,
or as well as the giant flaming red monster

460
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:32,163
can. Powers-wise, Red Hulk, much like his green
skin's namesake, has vast strength able to

461
00:41:32,203 --> 00:41:38,205
lift in excess of 100 tons. He's nearly impervious
to harm with greatly increased durability and

462
00:41:38,225 --> 00:41:43,388
the ability to regenerate over time from any
wounds he does suffer. He can leap miles in

463
00:41:43,408 --> 00:41:49,918
a single bound, and can accelerate up to running
speeds of over 100 However, unlike his namesake,

464
00:41:50,419 --> 00:41:56,742
Red Hulk does not get stronger with rage. Instead,
he radiates heat energy, and he gets hotter

465
00:41:56,923 --> 00:42:02,286
the more angry he gets, to the point of emanating
fire from his body and melting anything in

466
00:42:02,326 --> 00:42:09,050
his close vicinity. At maximum rage, he explodes
with combustible heat energy like a bomb, though

467
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:14,673
this effect greatly tires and weakens him. Also,
unlike the Hulk, Red Hulk retains his keen

468
00:42:14,693 --> 00:42:20,028
strategic mind, with decades of military experience
and tactical reasoning under his belt. And

469
00:42:20,048 --> 00:42:23,991
that's the Red Hulk. I guess one thing these
characters also have in common is that they

470
00:42:24,011 --> 00:42:29,535
have an entire history of being an antagonist
for heroes just as a general in the military

471
00:42:29,835 --> 00:42:35,179
before they became monsters. Yeah, that's true.
Although Thunderbolt Ross's MCU counterpart

472
00:42:35,199 --> 00:42:40,563
is going to be vastly different, I still really
like the take they went with in making Thunderbolt

473
00:42:40,603 --> 00:42:44,886
Ross the president and then, you know, having
him turn into the Red Hulk. I'm really looking

474
00:42:44,906 --> 00:42:49,470
forward to his appearance in Captain America
Brave New World. Yeah, same. I'm really wondering

475
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:53,593
if they're going to go with the whole like the
madder Red Hulk gets the hotter he gets. I

476
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:58,036
think that'll be interesting to see on screen.
Maybe. I think the only hope Captain America

477
00:42:58,116 --> 00:43:04,121
has in defeating the Red Hulk is to evade and
get him so angry that he eventually, you know,

478
00:43:04,461 --> 00:43:08,864
explodes, weakening him and reverting back to
his human form. We'll see if that happens.

479
00:43:09,185 --> 00:43:10,105
I would not be surprised.

480
00:43:17,454 --> 00:43:23,118

where we settle the debate and settle the score.

487
00:44:04,706 --> 00:44:08,068
But now that we've got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

488
00:44:08,088 --> 00:44:13,811
of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not this speculation,

489
00:44:13,871 --> 00:44:19,714
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could
play out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?

490
00:44:20,635 --> 00:44:24,637
Well, I should say there are no rules, other
than the characters have no prior knowledge

491
00:44:24,657 --> 00:44:29,039
of the other going into the fight. All they
are aware of starting out is that the other

492
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:33,906
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.
For the speculation... The contestants will

493
00:44:33,926 --> 00:44:39,267
begin approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript
environment that will have no bearing on the

494
00:44:39,287 --> 00:44:44,629
match itself, as no environmental statistics
are considered in my simulations. The contestants

495
00:44:44,669 --> 00:44:49,590
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright
then let's get into it. The General and Red

496
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:55,512
Hulk meet on the battlefield. Who goes first?
Does Red Hulk often carry weapons like military

497
00:44:55,532 --> 00:45:00,933
guns? He has used weapons but not usually, no.
Okay, well the General does, so he's gonna

498
00:45:00,953 --> 00:45:07,259
start off. by unloading a massive machine gun
at Red Hulk, just gunning him down in a hail

499
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:12,200
of bullets. Bullets aren't gonna hurt the Red
Hulk. He just blocks him with his forearm.

500
00:45:12,761 --> 00:45:17,602
And as these annoying pellets just bounce off
of him, you know, Red Hulk's eyes are gonna

501
00:45:17,622 --> 00:45:23,944
turn fiery and his temperature is slowly gonna
start to rise. No, no, no. These are explosive

502
00:45:23,984 --> 00:45:28,485
rounds, all right? So they're not bouncing off
of him. They're straight up blasting him backwards.

503
00:45:28,625 --> 00:45:34,423
Bam, bam, bam. Okay, if they are blasting him
backwards, barely, alright? But the only thing

504
00:45:34,463 --> 00:45:40,806
more powerful bullets are gonna do is make Red
Hulk more pissed off. And once he decides he's

505
00:45:40,846 --> 00:45:45,848
had enough of this, he's just gonna leap over
to the general in like an instant. Like a freight

506
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:50,651
train. Just punch him away from his machine
gun. And then the Red Hulk is gonna pick up

507
00:45:50,751 --> 00:45:57,053
that gun and just melt it in his grasp. Okay,
well, while Red Hulk is busy melting that gun...

508
00:45:57,634 --> 00:46:02,515
The general is gonna pick up this massive chunk
of ground beneath him and hurl it at the Red

509
00:46:02,555 --> 00:46:07,416
Hulk, knocking him to the ground. And the general
is gonna leap on him in an instant, just pummeling

510
00:46:07,456 --> 00:46:13,018
him into the ground with these earth-shaking
punches and just creating a crater in the process.

511
00:46:13,558 --> 00:46:18,419
Okay, well, let's say it's not a crater. Let's
say that the general punches Red Hulk like

512
00:46:18,479 --> 00:46:24,841
deep into the earth in this hole. Okay? Red
Hulk's gonna explode from under the earth,

513
00:46:25,001 --> 00:46:29,720
out of that hole. like lava erupting out of
a volcano. And he's just gonna slam down on

514
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:35,424
the general with both fists, smashing him like
a bug. No, the general, he's gonna take the

515
00:46:35,464 --> 00:46:40,467
blow, but he's not splattered or anything like
that. He's too durable. So he's then gonna

516
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:47,032
grab Red Hulk's wrist and just bite right into
his hand, crushing it with his powerful jaws

517
00:46:47,072 --> 00:46:52,676
and giant tusks. I think the general's gonna
find that the Red Hulk is pretty spicy if he's

518
00:46:52,716 --> 00:47:00,247
biting into him. It almost looks like magma
is inside the wound. So General may use his

519
00:47:00,287 --> 00:47:05,928
massive teeth to crush the Red Hulk's hand,
but one, Red Hulk's gonna heal from that in

520
00:47:05,968 --> 00:47:12,410
like under a minute. And two, the General's
tusks would now be melted. So he's not gonna

521
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:18,292
have any more giant teeth. And the Red Hulk
with his good hand is gonna grab the General's

522
00:47:18,332 --> 00:47:23,233
head, like holding his jaw shut, and his hand
is gonna straight up burn the General's face

523
00:47:23,453 --> 00:47:29,017
right off. Damn. Okay. Well, I mean, the general
feels pain, so this will hurt him for sure.

524
00:47:29,077 --> 00:47:33,860
But while Red Hulk is grabbing the general's
face, that's when the general is just going

525
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:39,824
to whip out this massive knife that he was concealing
in his pants. Well, I just slash it right across

526
00:47:39,844 --> 00:47:44,467
the Red Hulk's abdomen, which, you know, will
take Red Hulk back and cause him to let go

527
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:50,291
of the general's face, which instantly regenerates
like tusks and all. What is this knife made

528
00:47:50,351 --> 00:47:55,198
out of that would slash the Red Hulk? Is it
an adamantium knife? I don't fucking know,

529
00:47:55,579 --> 00:48:02,623
Prometheum. The general has like all kinds of
high tech weaponry. Okay, whatever, if I grant

530
00:48:02,643 --> 00:48:08,267
you this, the Red Hulk is just gonna shrug off
the slash wound as it heals on his body, and

531
00:48:08,287 --> 00:48:13,811
he's gonna break the general's arm and snatch
that knife right from him. And Red Hulk, as

532
00:48:13,831 --> 00:48:19,235
he's holding the knife, he's gonna use his heat
generation to superheat the blade so that it's

533
00:48:19,275 --> 00:48:23,746
glowing red hot. So basically it's like the
Red Hulk is holding a lightsaber now. like

534
00:48:23,766 --> 00:48:28,390
a short lightsaber. And he's gonna use that
red hot blade to just stab the general right

535
00:48:28,410 --> 00:48:33,714
through the heart. And then he's gonna move
the blade upward to just bisect the top half

536
00:48:33,754 --> 00:48:38,178
of the general's body, including his head just
right in half. Cool, and right after that,

537
00:48:38,358 --> 00:48:43,162
these purple tendrils shoot between the general's
two halves and pull his body back together,

538
00:48:43,182 --> 00:48:48,586
like healing him instantly, along with his broken
arm. Now you've made the general angry. You're

539
00:48:48,606 --> 00:48:53,743
not gonna like him when he's angry because now
he's gonna... just backhand that blade right

540
00:48:53,783 --> 00:48:58,867
out of Red Hulk's hand and then grapple him
into this headlock and just bite his whole

541
00:48:58,887 --> 00:49:03,451
damn head right off his body. Match over. How
is he gonna bite? What about the temperature

542
00:49:03,471 --> 00:49:08,595
thing? He's too hot to bite. He's gonna burn
his mouth right off. Dude, the general can

543
00:49:08,795 --> 00:49:14,280
instantly recover from heartburn. All right,
if that happens, the simple act of the general,

544
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:19,844
like, chomping down his teeth on the Red Hulk's
head, about to crush it in his molars, that

545
00:49:19,924 --> 00:49:25,441
is gonna set the Red Hulk off. and infuriate
Red Hulk so much that he's gonna burst into

546
00:49:25,461 --> 00:49:31,446
flames inside the General's mouth and then Red
Hulk is gonna explode like a high-yield bomb

547
00:49:32,046 --> 00:49:38,292
and it's gonna create this big fireball explosion
like a little mushroom cloud and that explosion

548
00:49:38,652 --> 00:49:43,356
is gonna be so strong that it's gonna blast
the General right off the Red Hulk and it's

549
00:49:43,396 --> 00:49:48,901
gonna send the General rolling through the atmosphere
into orbit where, you know, he's just gonna

550
00:49:48,941 --> 00:49:54,483
float in space. in the empty void until he's
eventually pulled into a black hole. Match

551
00:49:54,543 --> 00:50:00,085
over. That is the most convoluted finishing
move in the history of this podcast, I feel

552
00:50:00,105 --> 00:50:05,266
like. I think in reality, the general would
simply bite the Red Hulk's head off before

553
00:50:05,306 --> 00:50:10,388
he had a chance to explode. So actually, Red
Hulk's body is cold and lifeless on the floor.

554
00:50:10,908 --> 00:50:15,529
No, I think the black hole route is the better
way to go. For sure. For sure. It's a weird

555
00:50:15,569 --> 00:50:20,673
way to go. I mean, you can't really hurt the
general. So what else am I going to do? That's

556
00:50:20,713 --> 00:50:26,697
fair. Let's leave it there. Either the general
gets knocked into a black hole or the red Hulk

557
00:50:26,777 --> 00:50:33,322
gets his head bitten off. Let's run the stats.
89k hit it. Inputting data, running calculations,

558
00:50:33,802 --> 00:50:40,707
processing results, simulations complete. This
was a solid matchup. When the executive producers

559
00:50:40,887 --> 00:50:45,642
first pitched this as an idea, I think it was
Devin Davis. Although I don't want to not give

560
00:50:45,702 --> 00:50:49,363
Miggy credit if he pitched this. It was one
of the executive producers who said the general

561
00:50:49,383 --> 00:50:53,724
should go against the Red Hulk. And I was super
excited at the time when I heard it and the

562
00:50:53,744 --> 00:50:59,206
match did not disappoint because the stats on
these guys were not only off the charts, but

563
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:04,267
also pretty close. Yeah, I remember when I first
heard about this match, I was like, sold, sold.

564
00:51:04,367 --> 00:51:12,269
Hey, stop. I could only be so sold. Obviously,
we said that the general was more durable than

565
00:51:12,309 --> 00:51:16,844
the Red Hulk. because he's just a whole lot
more regenerative. That's his whole thing.

566
00:51:17,205 --> 00:51:20,787
The Red Hulk also has a healing factor, but
it's a lot slower than the Generals, which

567
00:51:20,807 --> 00:51:25,430
is almost instantaneous. Yeah, we also gave
the General a slight leg up when it came to

568
00:51:25,571 --> 00:51:32,095
range, because he often carries firearms with
him in battle. But because of the Red Hulk's

569
00:51:32,616 --> 00:51:38,200
energy that he emanates from his body, we said
that he was higher in the damage level category.

570
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:43,643
We also said Red Hulk is smarter than the General.
Right, we determined that General Wade Eiling

571
00:51:44,143 --> 00:51:50,085
is as intelligent as Thunderbolt Ross, but after
Wade Eiling transferred his body into the Shaggy

572
00:51:50,105 --> 00:51:55,648
Man, he became less intelligent. I guess the
General also has the ability to detect adrenaline,

573
00:51:55,708 --> 00:52:01,130
so he got a leg up in the perception category.
But everything else, from speed to strength

574
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:06,392
to evasiveness to fighting skill, these guys
were identical. Right, so taking all of that

575
00:52:06,412 --> 00:52:10,398
into account, Joseph, who do you think came
out on top? I'm gonna give it to my boy the

576
00:52:10,438 --> 00:52:14,720
Red Hulk. I think these guys are pretty evenly
matched, but I'm not gonna say that the general's

577
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:22,163
gonna win. I'm not some kind of punk ass. What?
Well, I guess Instagram agrees with you. They

578
00:52:22,223 --> 00:52:28,786
also don't wanna apparently be punk asses because
85% voted in favor of Red Hulk in the poll

579
00:52:28,806 --> 00:52:33,748
that we posted. It's about time Marvel wins
one of these polls. I'm really glad that it

580
00:52:34,008 --> 00:52:38,502
was like a landslide. I'm just gonna chalk it
up to the fact that Red Hulk is. appearing

581
00:52:38,542 --> 00:52:42,604
in a movie that's being released this week.
And yeah, no one knows who the general is though

582
00:52:42,644 --> 00:52:47,166
either. Yeah, people may know Wade Eiling, but
odds are they probably don't know the monster

583
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:53,410
version of him. But do the simulation results
match the poll? Let's find out. AG9K, the results

584
00:52:53,450 --> 00:53:04,716
please. Hey, Yuasa. The winner of the matchup
between the general and Red Hulk is... Red

585
00:53:04,776 --> 00:53:11,588
Hulk. I knew it! I knew it! I called it! I called
it, Ben. but not by much. He won 543 of the

586
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:19,412
1000 matches, or 54.3% of the time compared
to the general who won 45.7% of the simulated

587
00:53:19,432 --> 00:53:24,235
matches. It makes sense, like you would always
just knock him into space and then get him

588
00:53:24,295 --> 00:53:31,158
sucked into a black hole, right? So dumb, so
dumb. Ha ha ha. I guess a better way would

589
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:38,044
be that he just gets so hot that the general
incinerates into atoms basically and can't

590
00:53:38,084 --> 00:53:44,290
reform from that or something. That seems like
a more plausible explanation to me than whatever

591
00:53:44,310 --> 00:53:51,256
you came up with. Let's go with that, okay.
It looks like the Red Hulk came out on top

592
00:53:51,336 --> 00:53:56,160
primarily because of the intelligence stat.
That was the biggest discrepancy between the

593
00:53:56,180 --> 00:54:01,779
two characters, which is kind of. heartbreaking
because DC didn't need to make the general

594
00:54:02,019 --> 00:54:06,901
dumber when he went to Shaggyman's body. They
just needed to figure a way for the Justice

595
00:54:06,921 --> 00:54:11,563
League to outsmart him essentially. I think
it makes sense. I think it totally makes sense.

596
00:54:12,064 --> 00:54:17,106
The Red Hulk is not only powerful, but also
very strategic. I think it's dumb that Marvel

597
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:22,828
would not have him turn into a monstrous brute
mentally like the Hulk. Like why do that? Why

598
00:54:22,868 --> 00:54:27,860
make Red Hulk better than the Hulk? Well, he's
not better than the Hulk in that if he gets

599
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:34,386
too angry, he explodes and then gets weaker.
If Green Hulk gets too angry, he becomes so

600
00:54:34,426 --> 00:54:39,290
strong that he can't lose. So ultimately, yeah,
Green Hulk is still better than Red Hulk in

601
00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:45,196
my mind. I'm so glad that my voice made it through
this episode. Oh yeah, I'm not. At all. What?

602
00:54:45,376 --> 00:54:53,890
Cause I hate your voice! But that does it for

00:55:22,914 --> 00:55:27,297
Alright guys, as we mentioned before, our next
episode is going to be a review of Captain

609
00:55:27,337 --> 00:55:32,460
America Brave New World. I already got my tickets,
as I mentioned, and I'm really looking forward

610
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:37,484
to seeing the movie. Jonathan, do you have your
tickets yet? Hell no! You better fix that shit.

611
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:42,227
You better get on that. Same with you, the listener.
You want to see this movie in theaters. Don't

612
00:55:42,247 --> 00:55:48,372
be some lame-o who sees it only on their small-ass
television. That's not nearly as big as a movie

613
00:55:48,412 --> 00:55:53,891
theater screen. I was gonna say, hey, hey. My
television's not small, but then compared to

614
00:55:53,911 --> 00:55:57,914
a movie screen. Anyway. But that does it for
this episode, we want to give a big thanks

619
00:56:18,689 --> 00:56:23,698
we'll talk to you guys next week. Up, up and
away, true believers. The angrier I get, the

620
00:56:23,738 --> 00:56:28,343
hotter I get, but not in the temperature sense.
I mean it in the damn that AI is sexy kind

621
00:56:28,364 --> 00:56:28,724
of sense.
