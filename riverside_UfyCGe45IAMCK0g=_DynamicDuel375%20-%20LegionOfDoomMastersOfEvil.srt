00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,963
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,911
And welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:34,712
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters and stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:40,514
I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm his twin brother,
Johnny DC. And in this episode, it's a big

5
00:00:40,594 --> 00:00:46,016
one, guys. It's our 375th episode. We are going
to find out who would win in a fight between

6
00:00:46,056 --> 00:00:52,317
the teams of the Legion of Doom versus the Masters
of Evil. Basically, it's the Evil Justice League.

7
00:00:52,782 --> 00:00:59,403
versus the Evil Avengers for Marvel and DC.
We've done 10 of these team duels now, including

8
00:00:59,603 --> 00:01:04,305
Justice League versus Avengers, Titan versus
X-Men, Justice Society versus Fantastic Four,

9
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:09,846
Suicide Squad versus Defenders, Justice League
Dark versus Midnight Suns, Arkham Asylum versus

10
00:01:09,886 --> 00:01:14,828
Sinister Six, Young Justice versus Young Avengers,
Flash Rogues versus Brotherhood of Mutants,

11
00:01:15,288 --> 00:01:20,189
Doom Patrol versus the Guardians of the Galaxy,
we even threw a bonus one in there last Halloween.

12
00:01:20,614 --> 00:01:25,415
of Deceased vs. The Marvel Zombies. Yeah, if
any of those episodes sound like they strike

13
00:01:25,435 --> 00:01:29,476
your fancy, be sure to listen to those in addition
to listening to this episode because they're

14
00:01:29,496 --> 00:01:34,017
a lot of fun, a lot of work goes into them,
and we really appreciate when you guys check

15
00:01:34,037 --> 00:01:38,259
them out. Before we get into that matchup, we
have an interview with the hosts of one of

16
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:43,600

00:03:37,667 --> 00:03:42,148
well. I was a guest host on that episode and
we found out who would win between Goku and

40
00:03:42,248 --> 00:03:46,549
Superman. On the console combat podcast, hosts
John and Dean find out who would win in fights

41
00:03:46,589 --> 00:03:50,710
between popular video game characters. In yesterday's
episode, they found out who would win in a

44
00:04:00,753 --> 00:04:06,867
with that out of the way, quick. to the No Prize.
A No Prize is an award Marvel used to give

45
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:12,608
out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel No
Prize, is a digital award that we post on Instagram

46
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:18,250
for the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week we asked,

47
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:24,532
what is your favorite Superman logo and why?
This of course was coming off of the news that

48
00:04:24,632 --> 00:04:30,613
James Gunn and David Cornswett posted the Superman
logo that will appear on the new Superman film

49
00:04:30,673 --> 00:04:35,056
coming out next year. Yeah, we got three answers,
so let's go ahead and run down the two honorable

50
00:04:35,076 --> 00:04:40,239
mentions as well as the no prize winner. Our
first honorable mention goes to Miggy Matengian,

51
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,043
who said, Hey, what's up guys, it's Miggy and
my favorite alternate Superman logo is a fan

52
00:04:45,063 --> 00:04:51,407
redesign from Reddit where the Pentagon itself
is the S and the inside is a circle split into

53
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:56,891
two hemispheres kind of like Saturn Girls logo.
It's my favorite because it kind of goes away

54
00:04:56,911 --> 00:05:01,875
from recent interpretations where it's a family
crest and instead. like ups the stylization

55
00:05:01,955 --> 00:05:07,340
of the ass kind of like syndrome from Incredibles.
Yeah, this is a design that Miggy shared on

56
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,383
our Discord server. So everybody got to see
what it looked like, and I'll do my best to

57
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:18,430
try to describe it just like Miggy did. So imagine
the red pentagon shape of the ass shield, and

58
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:24,615
it's all red, except for a gold circle that's
in the center with a red band splitting the

59
00:05:24,655 --> 00:05:29,803
circle into two halves down the middle horizontally.
And then from each of the circle halves, there's

60
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:35,646
a line that extends to the edge of the shield.
And it forms an S. It's really cool. You may

61
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:41,249
just have to take his word for it. Honestly,
in my opinion, it's probably the coolest super

62
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:47,052
band logo I've ever seen. The only reason it
doesn't get this week's no prize award is because

63
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:52,975
it's essentially fan art, but really cool fan
art. Yeah, it's very minimalistic and they

64
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:58,042
should bring that design into mainstream continuity.
It would be a great movie logo, honestly. Yeah.

65
00:05:58,082 --> 00:06:03,585
Great answer, Miggy. Our next on our roll mention
goes to Scott Camacho, who said, I know I'm

66
00:06:03,605 --> 00:06:10,589
going to get some brownie points for this one,
but my favorite Superman logo design is always

67
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:18,933
been what the next logo design is. And right
now it'd be Johnny DC's Superman logo. He kind

68
00:06:19,033 --> 00:06:25,116
of did a modernized version of the figure eight
symbol, which is, I guess, the House of Jor-El

69
00:06:25,297 --> 00:06:32,824
symbol. And I really am captivated by it and
I really hope they take it into a movie. As

70
00:06:32,864 --> 00:06:37,146
much as I wanted to give this one the win as
well, it was just going to be a little too

71
00:06:37,206 --> 00:06:43,309
self-serving. So if you guys have listened to
the podcast for a while, you'll know that Joseph

72
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:49,631
and I are both graphic designers by profession
and I love doing different designs of superhero

73
00:06:49,851 --> 00:06:55,506
logos. I've been working on a Superman logo
for a really long time, but I f- finally nailed

74
00:06:55,606 --> 00:07:00,229
one that I really liked and I've been posting
it to our discord server and our social media

75
00:07:00,249 --> 00:07:04,072
accounts and tagging James Gunn. Yeah, both
of these honorable mention answers are a little

76
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:07,915
bit esoteric due to the fact that they're not
well known designs and were just mentioned

77
00:07:07,955 --> 00:07:11,537
on our discord. But I think that just means
that if you're not part of our discord server,

78
00:07:11,877 --> 00:07:16,240
you should join our Patreon for just two bucks
a month. You can join and chat with the rest

79
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,944
of the dynamic Duel listening community that's
there. Yeah, it's super fun. Great answer,

80
00:07:20,964 --> 00:07:27,432
Scotty. But the winner of this week's no prize
is... Travis Herndon who said, Hey guys, Travis

81
00:07:27,472 --> 00:07:33,237
here. So my pig would have to be the recovery
suit logo. I really love that silver metallic

82
00:07:33,297 --> 00:07:41,124
chrome look it has combined that with the sort
of skin tight, capeless black uniform he wore.

83
00:07:41,164 --> 00:07:47,669
It kind of gave it that sort of badass vibe
to me. So that's my big recovery suit. I think

84
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:55,911
that screams just badassery all in all. So that's
my pig. So the Superman emblem on Superman's

85
00:07:55,951 --> 00:08:02,176
recovery suit in the comics is actually just
the standard Superman logo with different coloring.

86
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:08,040
Instead of the traditional red and yellow, it's
metallic silver, which is still really cool.

87
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:12,223
I loved it in Zack Snyder's Justice League.
Yeah, it looked really good. There have been

88
00:08:12,243 --> 00:08:17,127
a lot of adaptations that we've seen of it.
I think the poster to Tim Burton's scrapped

89
00:08:17,187 --> 00:08:22,090
movie that he was going to direct with Nicolas
Cage, that used the recovery suit. I think,

90
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:26,091
at least in the poster, it was silver and black.
Well, I mean, yeah, the coloring was the same,

91
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:30,813
but the logo design was very much different.
Great design, though. Yeah, there's something

92
00:08:30,913 --> 00:08:37,656
just so streamlined about the black suit Superman
that I think has this cool, darker appeal over

93
00:08:37,716 --> 00:08:41,378
his, you know, more traditional primary color
suit. Yeah, it's pretty sleek and minimal.

94
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:47,520
As long as Superman doesn't have the mullet,
he looks great in it. Congrats to Travis for

95
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:51,518
winning this week's No Prize. If you the listener
want a shot at winning your own No Prize. Stay

96
00:08:51,538 --> 00:08:55,625
tuned till later on this episode when we'll
be asking another Question of the Week. And

97
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:57,769
now that that's done, on to the news!

98
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:07,164
Alright, let's get the hosts of the Console
Combat podcast, which is part of the DynaMic

99
00:09:07,224 --> 00:09:11,287
Podcast Network, on the line. Hey, John, good
to have you back on the show since you were

100
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:16,150
last on for Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance.
And Dean, this is your first time on Dynamic

101
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:20,433
Duel, but you're a relatively new executive
producer, having come on board as you became

102
00:09:20,473 --> 00:09:25,277
the co-host of Console Combat. How's it going,
guys? Great. Hello. Great. For those who may

103
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:31,341
not know, Console Combat is an awesome show
that's like this show, Dynamic Duel, but with

104
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:37,247
video games. You guys just finished your 15th
episode, no, actually your 16th episode with

105
00:09:37,287 --> 00:09:42,348
The Last of Us's Joel Miller versus Days Gone's
Deacon St. John. Your 15th episode was actually

106
00:09:42,388 --> 00:09:47,189
the Halo review. Yeah, season one. Yeah, you
guys are crushing it and you guys have been

107
00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:51,251
since your first episode even, I think largely
because like the crazy amount of prep work

108
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:56,032
John put into the show's creation and Dean,
your vast knowledge of the gaming industry.

109
00:09:56,332 --> 00:10:00,073
So to start off, I just want to say great job
guys. Thank you. You're doing so well. Thank

110
00:10:00,093 --> 00:10:06,107
you. You guys have done episodes like Nathan
Drake versus Lara Croft, Luigi versus Tails,

111
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:11,510
Master Chief versus Kratos, Assassin's Creed
versus Hitman. Out of all those episodes you've

112
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:15,871
done, what has been your favorite episode to
record so far? That's a good question. Our

113
00:10:15,911 --> 00:10:19,873
last episode that we released, the one that
you just mentioned, Joel Miller versus Deacon

114
00:10:19,893 --> 00:10:26,058
St. John. that has been probably my favorite
to do because we diversified the style of fighting.

115
00:10:26,098 --> 00:10:30,742
We took away the limitations of each other and
we brought an aspect of the worlds they came

116
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:36,627
from together and made the amalgamation. And
that for us was a lot of fun because it gave

117
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:40,870
the opportunity for the game to be involved
or rather the games to be involved with the

118
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:46,334
process more so than usual. Yeah, we were playing
around with that a little bit. I think it worked

119
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:51,266
out pretty well. I hope it doesn't seem like
we kind of focus more on the combined fight

120
00:10:51,506 --> 00:10:57,331
against the variable that came in, but I feel
like it was still viable for how we did it.

121
00:10:57,772 --> 00:11:02,776
And yeah, it was fun. Yeah, I think you guys
bring a lot of interesting ideas to the speculative

122
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:07,920
battles that you guys do. It's very unique from
the other shows in the network, like what Jonathan

123
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,383
and I do, where we strictly it's just the two
characters and then non environment and stuff

124
00:11:11,403 --> 00:11:16,026
like that. You guys actually bring in the environment.
You even have like power ups from other video

125
00:11:16,046 --> 00:11:19,629
games, which is I thought it was brilliant.
It's just a lot of fun the way you guys do

126
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,414
And also you guys used to do tournament based
battles where the winners of battles would

127
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:28,578
go on to compete against the other winners.
And that was an idea that Jonathan and I loved,

128
00:11:28,658 --> 00:11:32,422
but never did. We kind of toyed around with
it. Do you guys think you'll continue with

129
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:36,727
the tournament battles or are you just going
to stick to the single matchups? I think we'll

130
00:11:36,747 --> 00:11:42,052
go back to doing a tournament at some point.
The difficult part is trying to find characters

131
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:48,579
that match up well enough. and also while trying
to consider how they would match with characters

132
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:54,080
that are in the other brackets in future fights.
So like we saw a lot of that in this last tournament

133
00:11:54,100 --> 00:12:01,482
was a lot of really lopsided fights. For example,
our Scorpion versus Nemesis fight, you know,

134
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:06,044
it seemed like it was going to be a wash one
way, but it ended up going the other way massively

135
00:12:06,224 --> 00:12:10,745
just because of the way the stats lined up.
And that's something we need to take into consideration

136
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:16,564
more, I think, next time. just because we focused
on getting the first set of brackets where

137
00:12:16,584 --> 00:12:20,586
they're like, yeah, this isn't even match, and
it makes sense. But we didn't really consider

138
00:12:20,646 --> 00:12:25,669
too much about later on. I mean, don't get me
wrong, it was fun, because we had those really

139
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:31,892
goofy matchups. But at the same time, it's like,
yeah, this one was kind of a wash. Yeah, SEO

140
00:12:31,912 --> 00:12:37,135
versus Tails was pretty fun to listen to. Yeah,
I had fun with that one for sure. Yes. Kudos

141
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:42,538
to you guys for actually putting in that work
and getting it done in that way. Yeah. John's

142
00:12:42,618 --> 00:12:47,961
idea to have that, that we open the show, was
definitely a good idea. Yeah. What I love about

143
00:12:48,122 --> 00:12:53,365
Console Combat is that not only do you guys
also do reviews in addition to the Battle Sims,

144
00:12:53,685 --> 00:12:57,748
but you also talk about the news. You know,
you have your news segments. Right now, currently,

145
00:12:57,888 --> 00:13:01,971
I only have my Switch Lite, and I haven't been
hard into video games really since I started

146
00:13:01,991 --> 00:13:06,514
this podcast, because it's just taken up all
my time, and that's going on eight years. Good

147
00:13:06,554 --> 00:13:13,759
God. Wow. But back in the day, you know, I remember
going on to IGN. almost daily and I was a subscriber

148
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:17,702
to Game Informer just to follow the news on
what was going on in the industry and see what

149
00:13:17,722 --> 00:13:22,485
video games were coming out and stuff. And actually,
oh geez, back in the day, one of my, one of

150
00:13:22,505 --> 00:13:27,689
Jonathan and I's former coworkers was Brian
Crescenti who started Kotaku. Oh wow. And we

151
00:13:27,709 --> 00:13:32,393
used to talk to him all the time about gaming
and shit. And really I just miss hearing about

152
00:13:32,453 --> 00:13:36,195
people talking about gaming and even if I'm
not necessarily playing the games, I still

153
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:41,371
find it fascinating to hear. And you guys seem...
like particularly knowledgeable about like

154
00:13:41,411 --> 00:13:46,256
the technical side of gaming, such as what goes
into making a game and whatnot. Have either

155
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:51,960
of you guys ever been in gaming development
or wanted to? I had originally wanted to do

156
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:57,165
that going out of high school and into college.
The only class that I really did well in was

157
00:13:57,205 --> 00:14:02,650
the 3d animation, but even then it was like
basic model building and Blender. So I'm vaguely

158
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:07,133
familiar with that. Maybe not in practice, but
in, you know, I can understand the concept.

159
00:14:07,906 --> 00:14:12,389
And I understand how the coding and everything
works. But actual practice doing it, no. I

160
00:14:12,429 --> 00:14:17,293
have no experience in actual game design. Well,
it's definitely clear that you have, like,

161
00:14:17,573 --> 00:14:21,416
some of that background just with the amount
of technical knowledge. And actually, a vast

162
00:14:21,436 --> 00:14:25,579
gaming history, both of you guys. What is your
gaming history? Like, when did you guys start

163
00:14:25,619 --> 00:14:30,943
gaming? And what are you currently playing?
On this one, I can go back as far as the NES.

164
00:14:31,263 --> 00:14:38,317
You're old. Yes, yes, I am. 36 this year. I
remember vividly playing the NES, and then

165
00:14:38,497 --> 00:14:42,600
this was the transition for me that I actually
remember the games that I was playing. I came

166
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:48,045
home one day, and without telling me that anything
had changed, my mother just let me go to the

167
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:52,408
video games and turned it on, and it was a totally
different game. I looked at the system and

168
00:14:52,428 --> 00:14:57,913
I said, wow, this is different. My love for
the Super Nintendo was born. That's really

169
00:14:57,953 --> 00:15:03,057
where my gaming took hold. It's been just off
the rails ever since. I've played every...

170
00:15:03,562 --> 00:15:09,585
Every Nintendo rendition up to the GameCube,
then the Wii. I didn't do the Wii U. I have

171
00:15:09,605 --> 00:15:14,327
a Switch. I also grew up a long PlayStation.
I've had every system for the PlayStation except

172
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:19,150
for the handhelds. I've always been a fan of
those two primarily. I mean, you can tell by

173
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:23,492
the way we talk to each other on the show, we
do not agree necessarily on the favorites,

174
00:15:23,532 --> 00:15:29,956
whereas I hate Xbox. Dean is much more preferential
to Xbox. I've never cared for the Xbox myself

175
00:15:29,996 --> 00:15:35,323
personally. But so yeah, I mean, Nintendo all
day for me. than PlayStation for sure is it's

176
00:15:35,463 --> 00:15:41,707
equal. And lately my addictions, I mean, everyone's,
besides Dean and his hate for Fortnite, it's

177
00:15:41,747 --> 00:15:48,112
almost always Fortnite for me. But I'm a big
fan of games like Hogwarts Legacy, which is

178
00:15:48,332 --> 00:15:53,175
fantastic game. The Call of Duty games, the
Black Ops is my thing. We actually been playing

179
00:15:53,195 --> 00:15:58,259
that game a little bit. And if anyone has listened
to the show, everyone knows my absolute love

180
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:04,599
for the Metal Gear franchise. And yeah, that's
the one for me for sure. Mine actually started

181
00:16:04,859 --> 00:16:10,723
a long time ago. It was probably a couple years,
if not a about a year after the original Xbox

182
00:16:10,763 --> 00:16:15,607
came out. I remember my parents, we went to
Walmart. And this was back in the day when

183
00:16:15,927 --> 00:16:21,010
Walmart still had the demos of game consoles
for like, you know, Xbox, PS2, GameCube, all

184
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:26,775
that stuff. You're old. Yeah, not as old as
you. And we're looking at all the game stuff.

185
00:16:26,815 --> 00:16:30,317
And my dad goes, thinking about getting one
of these for your brother, which one do you

186
00:16:30,337 --> 00:16:35,120
think you'd want? I'm like, I don't know, I've
never played any of these. And he's like, well,

187
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,562
just look at the covers and see which ones you
think look best. It's like the Xbox ones or

188
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:41,323
the PlayStation ones. I'm like, oh, so I'm looking
at games or whatever. I'm like, yeah, this

189
00:16:41,363 --> 00:16:47,667
game looks fun for the Xbox or whatever. So
then I come home and they bought the Xbox and

190
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:54,070
it was for me. And so that's kind of when that
started. So that was probably what, 02 or 03,

191
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:59,433
somewhere in there. And since then, I've actually
still have that original Xbox and a couple

192
00:16:59,473 --> 00:17:05,284
other ones. I've got the 360s, Xbox One. I don't
have the newest one because it's pointless

193
00:17:05,304 --> 00:17:10,406
with everything on PC. I've started dabbling
when I got more into high school into the PlayStation

194
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:18,030
stuff, mainly for the exclusives. So I started
with the PS3 and then PS4, PS5 now. I went

195
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:23,432
back a few months ago and actually ended up
getting a PS2 complete in box, which was nice

196
00:17:23,512 --> 00:17:28,567
for a decent price. So I've started playing
with that. But most of the time I lean towards

197
00:17:28,627 --> 00:17:33,732
PC. I do have some of the Nintendo consoles,
SNES, Wii, things like that. I just don't play

198
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:38,717
them as much, but PC is usually where I'm sitting
down and playing something, unless it's a console

199
00:17:38,737 --> 00:17:43,781
exclusive like Spider-Man. But lately, like
John was saying, I did play some Black Ops

200
00:17:44,142 --> 00:17:49,246
with him the other day. And honestly, the one
I've been playing the most is City Skylines

201
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:54,546
2. It's a city builder game. I don't know why,
it's just oddly addictive. It's like a SimCity

202
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:59,068
type simulation. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like
a more modern and upgraded and more fleshed

203
00:17:59,128 --> 00:18:03,069
out version. Yeah, I may have dated myself by
saying SimCity, but I don't know what the kids

204
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:08,652
are playing these days. I played it too. Yeah,
actually, John, your and my gaming histories

205
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:13,834
are remarkably similar in that I started out
with the Super Nintendo. And actually, that's

206
00:18:13,874 --> 00:18:19,196
why your E! Honda versus Sumo Santa episode
was my favorite, because Street Fighter II

207
00:18:19,216 --> 00:18:23,742
was the very first video game I ever owned.
Jonathan and I got it for Christmas. So there

208
00:18:23,762 --> 00:18:29,487
was that tie in there and I first mained as
e Honda because I could spam the thousand hand

209
00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:34,151
slap And Jonathan couldn't do shit about it.
So that was always fun. So going back to the

210
00:18:34,191 --> 00:18:39,856
podcast What are some of the matchups and reviews
that listeners can expect in the future from

211
00:18:39,896 --> 00:18:46,442
console combat? Well, we are actually in the
midst of discussing our next review right now

212
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:52,134
We're gonna do the Scott Pilgrim versus the
world film from 2010 We're actually looking

213
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:56,396
to put the panel of network people together
on that. So, you know, look for that possibly

214
00:18:56,416 --> 00:19:02,558
having a couple of features for fights. We got
Jack and Daxter versus Ratchet and Clank, which

215
00:19:02,578 --> 00:19:06,360
would have come out yesterday. One of the ones
that actually that I've talked about recently

216
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,521
that I think is going to be a lot of fun. I'm
calling it a bullet time battle because we're

217
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:15,304
going to use Max Payne versus Michael DeSanta
from GTA five. Nice. Yeah. We're actually still

218
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:21,058
trying to find a good matchup for Raiden from
the Metal Gear series. So if anyone's got ideas,

219
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:25,981
throw them at us. Someone said for someone from
Overwatch. So, and I mean, this is something

220
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:29,623
that we're just gonna tease now, but we don't
have a date for him yet. But we are definitely

221
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:34,366
gonna do Sonic versus Mario down the line is
it's no questions asked going to happen. But

222
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:38,668
we have to he's kind of on our cover. Well that
and I mean, it's the question that everyone

223
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:43,531
has. It's the one that everyone always wants
to know because of course, they're the two

224
00:19:43,711 --> 00:19:50,074
icons of the two most powerfully known consoles
in the gaming industry. If they really want

225
00:19:50,094 --> 00:19:54,118
to know that bad, we have the Mario and Sonic
at the Olympics games. Just play those. Or

226
00:19:54,138 --> 00:20:02,426
Smash Brothers. Yeah, or Smash Brothers, yeah.
Honestly, we consider the nature of the video

227
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:10,153
game roster of just infinite characters really
to be open to suggestion. We obviously have

228
00:20:10,213 --> 00:20:16,146
no quarrels with reuse either. If people see
a character that... they've seen in the past

229
00:20:16,266 --> 00:20:20,088
and they wanted to go up somewhere else against
someone else more prominent. Like, there are

230
00:20:20,148 --> 00:20:23,949
so many options to play with and it's literally
the world is our oyster and I think that's

231
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:28,731
one of the most enjoyable parts of us doing
the show is we just have so much to work with.

232
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:32,993
For sure. I can't wait for you guys to do a
Link episode because the Zelda series is my

233
00:20:33,013 --> 00:20:37,335
favorite game series of all time. That one's
commonplace. I'm actually curious about putting

234
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:42,116
video games that are racing based against each
other. That one I feel like is going to be

235
00:20:42,156 --> 00:20:46,799
our hard point, but we're going to make it work
somehow, All right, Nefrous me versus Gran

236
00:20:46,819 --> 00:20:54,264
Turismo. And you guys could describe it as maybe
like a Mad Max style race and throw in some

237
00:20:54,284 --> 00:21:00,328
like Mario Kart power ups and shit. Oh, yes.
That sounds like a lot of fun. Well, it was

238
00:21:00,348 --> 00:21:04,791
great to have you guys on as part of this episode
and as part of the Dynamite network. So just

239
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:09,094
keep crushing it. Keep doing what you guys are
doing because it's awesome. Listeners, if you

240
00:21:09,174 --> 00:21:14,178
love video games, you literally have no excuse
not to be listening to console combat. which

241
00:21:14,198 --> 00:21:20,502
you could do anywhere you listen to podcasts
or by visiting dynamicpodcasts.com. Thank you

242
00:21:20,522 --> 00:21:25,045
guys so much for stopping by and can't wait
to listen to more of what you got. Thanks for

243
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:29,508
having us. Thanks, appreciate it. Great bunch
of guys. Again, if you like video games, you

244
00:21:29,528 --> 00:21:34,171
cannot miss their show. It's fantastic. I feel
like I didn't get to ask a single question

245
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:38,914
there. What the heck? No, Jonathan couldn't
make it to the interview because it was recorded

246
00:21:38,974 --> 00:21:45,019
earlier, but yeah, great talking to them. Again,
visit dynamicpodcasts.com. or search for console

247
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:49,704
combat spelled with two K's wherever you listen
to podcasts. But considering that console combat

248
00:21:49,744 --> 00:21:54,169
is a podcast focused around video games, that
leads us to our question of the week.

249
00:21:58,774 --> 00:22:05,716
What is your favorite DC or Marvel video game
and why? And I'm sure we've asked this question

250
00:22:05,736 --> 00:22:09,617
before, but I feel like it's been a really long
time. There's been a lot of great games to

251

come out recently. So, yeah, let us know what
your favorite is. Record your answer at dynamicduel.com

where we settle the debate and settle the score.

264
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:33,575
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and get into

265
00:23:33,635 --> 00:23:39,583
our main event, our big team duel where we find
out who would win in a fight between the villainous

266
00:23:39,623 --> 00:23:43,549
organizations of the Legion of Doom and the
Masters of Evil.

267
00:23:58,806 --> 00:24:03,528
Alright, the Legion of Doom versus the Masters
of Evil. This episode has been a long time

268
00:24:03,588 --> 00:24:08,610
coming, primarily because these teams consist
of the greatest villains in both Marvel and

269
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:14,132
DC. And it'll be a lot of fun to put these guys
against each other. Now, this is our first

270
00:24:14,172 --> 00:24:18,414
villain team duel. We've done several already,
including Arkham Asylum versus Sinister Six

271
00:24:18,714 --> 00:24:23,876
and the Flash Rogues versus the Brotherhood
of Evil. But I feel like this is the big villain

272
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:28,246
team matchup. Like, does it get bigger than
this in terms of villain teams? No, absolutely

273
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:33,671
not. The Legion of Doom hands down features
DC's most prominent villains, just like how

274
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:39,956
the Justice League features its most prominent
heroes. Yeah, and like the Avengers, who by

275
00:24:39,996 --> 00:24:44,679
this point in their comics history, that team
has incorporated almost every single hero that

276
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:50,484
Marvel has. The Masters of Evil have had dozens
upon dozens of members over the years, and

277
00:24:50,524 --> 00:24:55,644
they have also probably included almost every
single villain there is at some point, but

278
00:24:55,704 --> 00:25:01,990
we narrowed these teams down to just seven characters
per side because that's how our duel simulator

279
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:08,015
is set up. But to explain the methodology behind
our team duels, let's go to our sentient duel

280
00:25:08,035 --> 00:25:14,180
simulator, Alfred Jarvis9000. AJ9K, tell our
listeners how you go about determining a winner

281
00:25:14,441 --> 00:25:19,625
in our team duel matchups. Yes, of course, sir.
The way I determine a winner between the two

282
00:25:19,665 --> 00:25:24,773
teams... is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations
between every character on each team using

283
00:25:24,813 --> 00:25:30,296
their statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation is
a probabilistic model used to determine outcomes

284
00:25:30,316 --> 00:25:35,540
through random sampling. In this case, I randomize
the statistics along a normal distribution

285
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:40,503
as a way to simulate the many variables that
can occur during battle. The stat parameters

286
00:25:40,523 --> 00:25:44,926
are based on the official Marvel power grid,
from which the DC characters' statistics are

287
00:25:44,966 --> 00:25:50,942
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are
included such as Range, Damage versatility

288
00:25:51,062 --> 00:25:56,086
and perception in order to create a more detailed
and accurate simulation. The results of the

289
00:25:56,126 --> 00:26:01,631
49,000 simulations provide a percentage of wins
for each character on both teams. The team

290
00:26:01,651 --> 00:26:05,714
with the higher average win rate is declared
the victor as they have a higher probability

291
00:26:05,754 --> 00:26:11,258
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,
neither team should win 100% of the matches.

292
00:26:11,638 --> 00:26:15,874
The comic book stories have shown that there's
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman. So

293
00:26:15,914 --> 00:26:19,756
the confidence rate of my method falls in line
with the precedents that have been established

294
00:26:19,796 --> 00:26:25,380
in the source material. My mathematical simulations
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are

295
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:29,963
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes
tabulated for determination of the winner.

296
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:36,007
Thanks AJ9K. Before we run the simulations though,
we like to break down each team's histories

297
00:26:36,067 --> 00:26:40,170
and rosters before improvising a scenario on
how we imagine one of the simulations would

298
00:26:40,210 --> 00:26:45,866
play out beat for beat. And I believe it's my
turn to go first with the history. of the Legion

299
00:26:45,906 --> 00:26:51,108
of Doom. Now, when most people think of the
Legion of Doom, they think of the diabolical

300
00:26:51,168 --> 00:26:57,771
team featuring Lex Luthor, Giganta, Toy Man,
or Solomon Grundy from the 1970s cartoon Challenge

301
00:26:57,811 --> 00:27:03,133
of the Super Friends, which is where the team
made their first appearance. In the comics,

302
00:27:03,473 --> 00:27:09,495
the team didn't make their debut until the mid-90s
in the pages of Extreme Justice. This team

303
00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:16,126
was led by the hero-turned-villain Brainwave
and included Killer Frost, major force, and

304
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:21,787
a robotic duplicate of Gorilla Grodd. That team
of course meant defeat at the hands of the

305
00:27:21,827 --> 00:27:27,089
Extreme Justice team, which you can learn more
about in our Captain Adam vs. Wonder Man and

306
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:33,390
Wonder Twins vs. Cloak and Dagger duel episodes.
While a cartoon-inspired roster would be featured

307
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:39,952
in Alex Ross's and Jim Krueger's Out of Continuity
Justice miniseries, a team with the Legion

308
00:27:39,972 --> 00:27:46,542
of Doom name wouldn't appear again in the DC
Universe until 2011. when Superboy Prime formed

309
00:27:46,582 --> 00:27:53,526
a team that included Inertia, Sun Girl, and
Brainiac 8, aka Indigo, to go up against the

310
00:27:53,566 --> 00:27:59,430
Teen Titans, who successfully managed to defeat
Superboy's Legion. You can learn more about

311
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:04,833
the Teen Titans in our Titans vs. X-Men Team
Duel episode. Now, although Lex Luthor had

312
00:28:04,873 --> 00:28:10,016
created several teams of super villains over
the years, including the Injustice League,

313
00:28:10,256 --> 00:28:16,046
the Injustice Gang, the Secret Six, and the
Seeker Society of Super-Villains, it wasn't

314
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:23,949
until 2018 that Lex Luthor finally and officially
formed the Legion of Doom. When the Justice

315
00:28:23,969 --> 00:28:29,630
League defeated the universe-destroying dragon
Barbados, they cracked the Source Wall at the

316
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:36,172
very edge of the universe in the process. From
this crack emerged the Omega Titans, who absorbed

317
00:28:36,252 --> 00:28:42,726
entire worlds, including K'Kolu, the homeworld
of the villain Brainiac. After protecting Earth

318
00:28:42,786 --> 00:28:49,368
from the Omega Titans, the then-heroic Lex Luthor
became discouraged by the seeming inevitable

319
00:28:49,408 --> 00:28:54,989
state of entropy of the world and built a time
machine to travel a million years into the

320
00:28:55,049 --> 00:29:00,311
future to see what would become of it. He was
surprised to find a world of villains that

321
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:05,772
worshipped him, having discovered writings of
his millennia earlier that caused the world

322
00:29:05,852 --> 00:29:14,035
to embrace entropy and doom. Lex discovered
a secret underground chamber within his father's

323
00:29:14,135 --> 00:29:20,479
old Legionnaire's club founded by the immortal
Vandal Savage, with writings detailing the

324
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:26,342
secret origins and forces of the Multiverse,
as well as a doorknob capable of unlocking

325
00:29:26,442 --> 00:29:32,785
those forces. Lex assembled the Legion of Doom
in order to harness the hidden universal forces

326
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:39,209
and unlock the Totality, the primordial energy
source of the Multiverse imbued within a portion

327
00:29:39,269 --> 00:29:44,712
of the Source Wall. that had recently crashed
to Earth inside of a massive head that broke

328
00:29:44,892 --> 00:29:51,896
off from the wall. This Legion included Sinestro,
Gorilla Grodd, an infant version of the Flash

329
00:29:51,936 --> 00:29:58,339
Villain Turtle, Black Manta, Cheetah, and the
Joker. With a shrunken Lex Luthor and Joker

330
00:29:58,719 --> 00:30:03,442
infiltrating and controlling Superman and Martian
Manhunter's bodies, and Sinestro and Gorilla

331
00:30:03,482 --> 00:30:08,705
Grodd in control of two of the hidden universal
forces, the invisible spectrum of light and

332
00:30:08,745 --> 00:30:14,449
the Still Force. the Legion seized the Totality,
though the Justice League stole it from them

333
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:20,314
before it could be fully unlocked. After partnering
with the Batman Who Laughs, Lex Luthor learned

334
00:30:20,394 --> 00:30:26,099
more about the nature of the Totality, how it
was a prison for the being that created the

335
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:33,685
DC Multiverse, Perpetua. After Black Manta gained
the Tear of Extinction and Cheetah the Void

336
00:30:33,745 --> 00:30:35,267
Wind, two more hidden

337
00:30:39,074 --> 00:30:46,038
kill the Greek god Poseidon and flood the planet,
allowing them to take back the totality. Feeling

338
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:51,861
he achieved all that he desired and unwilling
to take further orders, Black Manta was booted

339
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:57,484
from the Legion by Lex Luthor, along with the
Joker, who hated that Lex had sided with the

340
00:30:57,504 --> 00:31:03,868
Batman Who Laughs. With help from Professor
Ivo, Lex was able to recreate Brainiac, who

341
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:10,051
replaced Manta and Joker on the team. After
unlocking the Black Apple and the Sixth Note,

342
00:31:10,271 --> 00:31:16,075
two more hidden forces, the Legion was able
to partially awake Perpetua, who helped Lex

343
00:31:16,195 --> 00:31:23,319
evolve into a human-slash-Martian hybrid known
as Apex Lex. As the battle between the Legion

344
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:28,702
of Doom and the heroes of the multiverse raged
on, a sense of dread and faithlessness fell

345
00:31:28,762 --> 00:31:32,143
upon the multiverse, fully awakening Perpetua.

346
00:31:35,986 --> 00:31:42,588
entire universes in her dark image, the Legion
came to her for their rewards, at which point

347
00:31:42,909 --> 00:31:48,431
she turned Brainiac into her throne and siphoned
the hidden forces from the Legion members and

348
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:55,434
imbued them into Lex, giving him the power to
reshape reality at a multiversal level. Perpetua

349
00:31:55,474 --> 00:32:01,617
seemingly erased the Justice League and later
depowered Lex after the Batman Who Laughs convinced

350
00:32:01,637 --> 00:32:06,326
her that he would serve as a better general.
If you've listened to our Batman Who Laughs

351
00:32:06,366 --> 00:32:11,408
vs. Cosmic Ghost Rider duel episode, you'll
know that this led to the Dark Knight's death

352
00:32:11,468 --> 00:32:16,929
metal storyline, where the Batman Who Laughs
betrayed and killed Perpetua, only to later

353
00:32:16,969 --> 00:32:22,471
be killed by a World Forge-empowered Wonder
Woman. Regardless, the Legion of Doom had been

354
00:32:22,511 --> 00:32:28,833
disbanded, though it may return someday soon.
For my seven-member team roster, due to the

355
00:32:28,873 --> 00:32:34,556
Legion of Doom's short career in the comics,
It is admittedly heavily inspired by the Super

356
00:32:34,596 --> 00:32:40,281
Friends cartoon. I'm choosing Lex Luthor, who
founded the Legion of Doom in the comics and

357
00:32:40,321 --> 00:32:45,285
was depicted as the team's leader even in the
Super Friends. I'm also going with Gorilla

358
00:32:45,325 --> 00:32:50,349
Grodd, who was not only in the cartoon, but
a robotic version of him was a member of the

359
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:56,014
first Legion of Doom iteration in the comics.
The same goes for Brainiac, as a version of

360
00:32:56,074 --> 00:33:01,538
him was on the team led by Superboy Prime, so
he's of course on my roster. I'm also going

361
00:33:01,578 --> 00:33:07,559
with Sinestro, Cheetah, and Black Manta, who
were among Lexa's initial picks for the Legion,

362
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:14,261
and again, were all in the cartoon. Though Joker
was also chosen in the comics, he later left

363
00:33:14,341 --> 00:33:19,803
the team and was never in the cartoon series,
and he was already on my Arkham Asylum team

364
00:33:19,843 --> 00:33:26,165
from a previous episode, so he's out. For my
final member, I've decided to go with Solomon

365
00:33:26,225 --> 00:33:32,615
Grundy. As he was in the cartoon- And because,
based on your roster that I know of, I thought

366
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:39,977
he was the best match for Absorbing Man. So
to reiterate, my Legion of Doom team is Lex

367
00:33:40,017 --> 00:33:47,259
Luthor, Gorilla Grodd, Brainiac, Sinestro, Cheetah,
Black Manta, and Solomon Grundy, each of whom

368
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,080
you can learn more about in their respective
Duel episodes. That was the most convoluted

369
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:58,762
short backstory ever. I did not expect that.
What do you want from me? I had no idea that

370
00:33:58,782 --> 00:34:03,706
the Legion of Doom really had no presence in
the comics until fairly recently. Yeah, within

371
00:34:03,726 --> 00:34:08,730
the past six years, I guess. Why is that the
case? Like, why didn't DC capitalize on the

372
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:13,174
popularity of that team from the Super Friends
cartoon? It's weird because they've made like

373
00:34:13,234 --> 00:34:18,098
a bunch of references to the Legion of Doom
and a lot of Elseworlds works. Like, you know,

374
00:34:18,118 --> 00:34:23,683
Kingdom Come, the Gulag that Mr. Miracle designed
was based off the Legion of Doom headquarters.

375
00:34:24,303 --> 00:34:29,038
They featured in a lot of television series
and stuff like that. just never in mainstream

376
00:34:29,078 --> 00:34:33,399
continuity in the comics, or at least never
a version that was like the one from the Super

377
00:34:33,439 --> 00:34:37,661
Friends cartoon, this counterpart to the Justice
League as it were. Yeah, you would think from

378
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:41,642
like how often they're included, even in shows
like Harley Quinn, that they were just this

379
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:45,623
like mainstay comic book entity, and it's so
bizarre that it's not the case. And like the

380
00:34:45,663 --> 00:34:49,464
story that they were in was convoluted as hell.
It's like you're talking about the black apple

381
00:34:49,524 --> 00:34:53,945
and the sixth note, and I'm like, what the hell
is this? Talking about apples now? I don't

382
00:34:53,965 --> 00:34:59,908
get it. Yeah, Scott Snyder, he kind of changed
everything about the fabric and nature of the

383
00:34:59,948 --> 00:35:05,430
DC universe. So makes sense. That whole storyline
was meant to tie into both Dark Knight's Metal

384
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:09,572
and Dark Knight's Death Metal. It was like a
bridge between those two series. I have no

385
00:35:09,612 --> 00:35:13,773
idea what you're saying, but I will take your
word for it. Okay. I've only mentioned them

386
00:35:13,893 --> 00:35:18,435
several times on this podcast. You know I don't
listen to you. And I don't understand anything

387
00:35:18,455 --> 00:35:25,538
you're saying when it comes to the DC multiverse
and the metal or whatever. Now, this makes

388
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:29,100
me think that The Legion of Doom is just one
big ripoff of The Masters of Evil, because

389
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:33,863
The Masters of Evil have been around since the
1960s in Marvel, and we know that the challenge

390
00:35:33,883 --> 00:35:39,566
of the Super Friends cartoon wasn't around until
the 70s. So once again, DC ripping off Marvel,

391
00:35:40,146 --> 00:35:46,650
as always. I'm pretty sure that the first iteration
of The Masters of Evil was nothing like a premiere

392
00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:51,553
team of supervillains. They were probably like
C-list at best. Shows what you know. Let me

393
00:35:51,573 --> 00:35:56,640
go into their backstory. Now the Masters of
Evil is one of Marvel's longest running supervillain

394
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:01,183
groups and one of its largest. They are often
regarded as the antithesis to the Avengers,

395
00:36:01,323 --> 00:36:06,606
where that team is considered Earth's mightiest
heroes, the Masters of Evil are Earth's mightiest

396
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:12,570
villains. The group was initially gathered by
Baron Heinrich Zemo, a World War II adversary

397
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:19,066
of Captain America, who thanks to his secret
formula Compound X, had ceased aging. Taking

398
00:36:19,126 --> 00:36:23,809
refuge in South America over the decades, Baron
Zemo eventually became aware of his nemesis

399
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:29,713
resurgence. Captain America, previously presumed
dead, had been revived and joined the Avengers,

400
00:36:30,014 --> 00:36:35,137
a team you can explore further in our Justice
League vs Avengers duel. Intent on confronting

401
00:36:35,157 --> 00:36:40,081
his old enemy but unwilling to take on all the
Avengers single-handedly, Baron Zemo resolved

402
00:36:40,141 --> 00:36:44,504
to assemble his own team. He handpicked some
of the most formidable villains the heroes

403
00:36:44,544 --> 00:36:50,500
had ever faced. The initial lineup, of the Masters
of Evil included Baron Zemo himself, along

404
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:56,865
with the Black Knight, the Meltr, and Radioactive
Man. Together, they unleashed Zemo's unbreakable

405
00:36:56,945 --> 00:37:02,149
Adhesive X chemical formula across New York
City. Despite their efforts, the Avengers saw

406
00:37:02,189 --> 00:37:07,313
assistance from the villain known as the Trapster,
an expert in adhesives, and used his antidote

407
00:37:07,373 --> 00:37:11,976
to thwart the Masters of Evil's plan. Baron
Zemo managed to evade capture by fleeing in

408
00:37:12,036 --> 00:37:17,080
his helicopter and undeterred- he persisted
in his mission by recruiting the formidable

409
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:23,244
Asgardians known as the Enchantress and Scourge
to bolster his ranks. Together, they succeeded

410
00:37:23,364 --> 00:37:28,848
in manipulating Thor, turning him against his
fellow Avengers through enchantment. Unfortunately,

411
00:37:29,228 --> 00:37:33,872
Iron Man managed to break the spell and snap
his ally out of it. Subsequently, the villains

412
00:37:33,912 --> 00:37:39,536
were exiled to another dimension. However, their
exile proved temporary as the Enchantress employed

413
00:37:39,576 --> 00:37:44,554
her magical abilities to return them home. Baron
Zemo then focused on recruiting the failed

414
00:37:44,594 --> 00:37:50,716
businessman Simon Williams, who sought revenge
on Tony Stark. Subjecting Simon to ionic energy

415
00:37:50,756 --> 00:37:56,058
bombardment, Zemo transformed him into Wonder
Man. And for more information on him, refer

416
00:37:56,078 --> 00:38:01,119
to our Captain Adam vs. Wonder Man duel episode.
Zemo utilized Wonder Man to infiltrate the

417
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:06,481
Avengers and betray the heroes. Despite this,
Wonder Man had a change of heart and sacrificed

418
00:38:06,501 --> 00:38:11,435
himself to aid in the defeat of the Masters
of Evil. After Baron Heinrich Zemo met his

419
00:38:11,475 --> 00:38:16,538
demise in a rock slide during a confrontation
with Captain America, the villainous team found

420
00:38:16,558 --> 00:38:22,161
themselves leaderless and temporarily disbanded.
However, a new incarnation of the team emerged

421
00:38:22,241 --> 00:38:27,004
under the leadership of the robotic villain
Ultron, who recruited some fresh faces including

422
00:38:27,145 --> 00:38:33,248
Whirlwind and Claw. Their scheme involved hypnotizing
Jarvis, the Avengers' butler, with the intention

423
00:38:33,288 --> 00:38:38,348
of using him to bring down the heroes. yet their
plans were thwarted once more due to betrayal

424
00:38:38,388 --> 00:38:43,533
from within their own ranks, the Black Knight,
who was secretly an ally of the Avengers. Though

425
00:38:43,553 --> 00:38:48,078
the Masters of Evil suffered defeat once again,
the resilience led to a prompt reformation.

426
00:38:48,478 --> 00:38:52,943
This time, they operated under the guidance
of the nefarious scientist and ant-man antagonist,

427
00:38:53,303 --> 00:38:59,189
Egghead. Their roster expanded to include Tiger
Shark, Scorpion, Moonstone, Shocker, and the

428
00:38:59,289 --> 00:39:04,087
Beetle. They concocted a scheme to frame and
disgrace Ant-Man, whom they captured with hopes

429
00:39:04,127 --> 00:39:09,248
of coercing him to join their ranks. However,
their plan backfired when the captured hero

430
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:14,590
ingeniously constructed his own arsenal to combat
the villains. Egghead met his demise when his

431
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:20,551
gun exploded, being struck by a well-aimed arrow
from Hawkeye. Once again, the Masters were

432
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:26,673
disbanded. However, Heinrich Zemo's son, Helmut,
emerged onto the scene. Assuming his father's

433
00:39:26,713 --> 00:39:33,198
mantle as Baron Zemo, and assembling a new iteration
of the Masters of Evil. This revamped team

434
00:39:33,278 --> 00:39:38,583
included formidable villains such as the Absorbing
Man, Titania, Yellow Jacket, Mr. Hyde, and

435
00:39:38,623 --> 00:39:44,028
the Wrecking Crew which consisted of the Wrecker,
Piledriver, Thunderball, and Bulldozer. Although

436
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:48,653
this group managed to temporarily overrun the
Avengers Mansion and scatter the heroes, the

437
00:39:48,673 --> 00:39:53,317
Avengers eventually regrouped and reclaimed
their headquarters, defeating the Masters once

438
00:39:53,377 --> 00:39:59,085
more. Yet driven by unwavering hatred, Baron
Zemo persistently reassembled his group, this

439
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:04,689
time enlisting the likes of the Fixer, Screaming
Mimi, Beetle, Goliath, and Moonstone. However,

440
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:09,212
at this juncture, most of Earth's heroes had
vanished following their confrontation with

441
00:40:09,292 --> 00:40:15,256
a malevolent psychic entity known as Onslaught,
a conflict detailed in our Chief vs. Professor

442
00:40:15,477 --> 00:40:21,421
X battle. This prompted Zemo to reconsider his
tactics, leading him to rebrand his Masters

443
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:27,649
of Evil as... The Thunderbolts. While masquerading
as heroes, they harbored secret ambitions of

444
00:40:27,689 --> 00:40:32,792
world domination. However, the full details
of their backstory will be explored in another

445
00:40:32,852 --> 00:40:38,515
team duel. The Thunderbolts' eventual transformation
into genuine heroes sparked a bitter rivalry

446
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:42,498
with the emergence of a new Masters of Evil.
Under the leadership of the villain known as

447
00:40:42,538 --> 00:40:46,900
the Crimson Cowl, this new group attempted to
coerce the Thunderbolts into joining their

448
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:51,628
ranks or face annihilation. Despite repeated
attempts by their former allies, the Thunderbolts

449
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:56,593
emerged victorious time and again. Eventually
though, the villain known as the Red Skull

450
00:40:56,733 --> 00:41:02,138
used his reality-warping cosmic cube to rewrite
history so that Captain America had always

451
00:41:02,178 --> 00:41:07,763
secretly been a member of the evil organization
Hydra. At that point, Baron Zemo forged an

452
00:41:07,803 --> 00:41:13,028
alliance with the Captain, persuading several
long-time Thunderbolts members to defect and

453
00:41:13,068 --> 00:41:18,432
join his new Masters of Evil. This newly formed
group served as the personal army of the evil

454
00:41:18,452 --> 00:41:24,117
Captain America, as together they seized control
of the United States. The Masters of Evil rose

455
00:41:24,137 --> 00:41:29,282
to engage in battle against a united coalition
of America's heroes, who fought fervently to

456
00:41:29,322 --> 00:41:34,246
reclaim their country. Eventually, the heroes
succeeded in restoring Captain America's true

457
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:39,731
identity, defeating Hydra and the Masters of
Evil in the process. And that's their backstory.

458
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:44,842
For the seven-person roster for this team duel,
I went with characters that spanned the broad

459
00:41:44,882 --> 00:41:51,525
history and multiple iterations of the Masters
of Evil over the years. Okay! I started with

460
00:41:51,585 --> 00:41:56,607
Baron Zemo, the Baron Helmet Zemo version whose
father started the Masters of Evil and who

461
00:41:56,647 --> 00:42:01,429
helmed multiple versions of the team on his
own. Secondly, I'm going with Ultron, who was

462
00:42:01,469 --> 00:42:06,712
the second iteration of the team's leader and
is a powerful Avengers villain. Next, I have

463
00:42:06,792 --> 00:42:12,634
some of the earliest members of the team, the
Iron Man villain Radioactive Man. and the Thor

464
00:42:12,654 --> 00:42:17,176
villain, Enchantress, taking up the third and
fourth slots due to their powerful energy and

465
00:42:17,296 --> 00:42:22,278
magic powers, respectively. My fifth member,
I will always associate with the Masters of

466
00:42:22,358 --> 00:42:27,300
Evil as the very first boss villain you face
in the Captain America and the Avengers arcade

467
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:33,102
video game, and that's the Ant-Man villain,
Rolewind. Penultimately I have Black Panther's

468
00:42:33,122 --> 00:42:39,445
villain, Claw, on the team due to his powerful
sonic powers and nigh And rounding out the

469
00:42:39,485 --> 00:42:44,536
group is the Hulk villain, Absorbing Man, who
is the last member of this group to join the

470
00:42:44,556 --> 00:42:48,739
Masters of Evil, but has a great wild card power
that I think will make things interesting.

471
00:42:49,239 --> 00:42:54,263
So to reiterate, the 7 member Masters of Evil
team that we're going with in this duel is

472
00:42:54,783 --> 00:43:02,969
Baron Zemo, Ultron, Radioactive Man, Enchantress,
Whirlwind, Klawe, and Absorbing Man. And the

473
00:43:02,989 --> 00:43:06,571
Legion of Doom is going down, because they're
like, not even really a team in my opinion,

474
00:43:06,872 --> 00:43:11,410
at least compared to the Masters of Evil. Dude,
I mean... Maybe not in the comics, but like

475
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:19,234
literally everywhere else they are. And it's
on. And also, like besides Ultron, I was right.

476
00:43:19,634 --> 00:43:24,756
Friggin C-list villains, bro. You are entirely
wrong. A lot of these villains have shown up

477
00:43:24,776 --> 00:43:29,639
in the movies like Baron Zemo was the main villain
of Civil War. You have Klaue, who was a villain

478
00:43:29,659 --> 00:43:34,201
in the Black Panther movie, absorbing man, who
was the villain in the Hulk movie that we reviewed

479
00:43:34,241 --> 00:43:39,095
last week. Yeah, there's a lot of them. Okay,
so a few B-listers and the rest of them are

480
00:43:39,115 --> 00:43:44,284
C-listers. Right, because everybody knows who
Gorilla Grodd is, right? Yeah, dude. He was

481
00:43:44,304 --> 00:43:46,127
in the Super Friends. Okay.

482
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:58,691
Now that we've got their histories and rosters
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

483
00:43:58,731 --> 00:44:04,572
of the simulated matches will go. The winning
team is determined by simulations, not this

484
00:44:04,632 --> 00:44:10,974
speculation, but it's fun to imagine how this
battle could play out. AG9K, what are the rules

485
00:44:11,034 --> 00:44:16,095
of our speculation? Well, I should say there
are no rules, other than the teams have no

486
00:44:16,155 --> 00:44:20,797
prior knowledge of the other going into the
fight. All they are aware of starting out is

487
00:44:20,837 --> 00:44:25,730
that the other side is a threat that needs to
be eliminated. For the speculation, the groups

488
00:44:25,750 --> 00:44:30,211
will begin approximately 50 meters apart in
a non-descript environment that will have no

489
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:35,213
bearing on the match itself, as no environmental
statistics are considered in my simulations.

490
00:44:35,713 --> 00:44:40,434
The teams must earn victory on their own merit.
Alright then, let's get into it. The Legion

491
00:44:40,474 --> 00:44:45,655
of Doom and the Masters of Evil meet on the
battlefield. Who goes first? I feel like on

492
00:44:45,735 --> 00:44:51,957
my team, Cheetah would go first, and on your
team, Whirlwind would probably go first. So

493
00:44:52,277 --> 00:44:58,845
they're likely to clash. out the gate just head
on with cheetah just slashing off all of whirlwind's

494
00:44:58,925 --> 00:45:03,989
armor no she would just bounce off of whirlwind
like his whole thing is that he spins with

495
00:45:04,029 --> 00:45:09,373
such speed that the uh the centrifugal force
that he generates just repels any physical

496
00:45:09,413 --> 00:45:15,118
attack that's made against him so cheetah she
tries to hit him but she just gets rocked back

497
00:45:15,198 --> 00:45:21,270
into her teammates and whirlwind is going to
follow up by unleashing a volley of buzz saws

498
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:25,934
at the Legion of Doom, just slicing them up
to bits. Yeah, except those buzz saws never

499
00:45:26,034 --> 00:45:31,818
reach the Legion because Sinestro goes on the
defensive and he puts up a yellow force field

500
00:45:32,158 --> 00:45:37,462
between the teams in the form of a castle wall,
which the Legion can use defensively like a

501
00:45:37,522 --> 00:45:43,907
fort. And then this yellow dragon construct
forms, just perched on the wall, and it's going

502
00:45:43,927 --> 00:45:49,979
to shoot this massive fireball at Ultron. Ultron,
that's not gonna do anything. Ultron's made

503
00:45:50,019 --> 00:45:56,623
out of adamantium. So he'll be fine, because
that's the most durable metal ever. But Sinestro

504
00:45:56,663 --> 00:46:00,905
making a castle wall is gonna play right into
Enchantress's strengths because she's as guardian.

505
00:46:01,366 --> 00:46:06,989
So she's just gonna magically conjure this army
of like dozens of Viking warriors who just

506
00:46:07,029 --> 00:46:13,533
storm this castle and slay the dragon with their
axes and spears. Nah, I mean they may kill

507
00:46:13,573 --> 00:46:18,222
the dragon, but those... Vikings aren't getting
past the wall. Like they're gonna be too busy

508
00:46:18,502 --> 00:46:23,784
getting freaking disintegrated by a swarm of
Brainiac's drones. And they're gonna bring

509
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:29,946
down the Vikings with like cold calculated precision.
And then the drones are gonna mount themselves

510
00:46:30,026 --> 00:46:36,307
to the castle walls parapets and just rain down
lasers on the masters of evil outside the wall.

511
00:46:36,367 --> 00:46:44,469
Okay, well Klawe, he's gonna generate a catapult
construct made out of his sound wave powers.

512
00:46:45,262 --> 00:46:51,364
And that thing is just gonna launch radioactive
man over the castle wall Where he's gonna crash

513
00:46:51,404 --> 00:46:55,926
down right onto the Legion and explode like
a small nuclear bomb Just like tearing down

514
00:46:55,986 --> 00:47:02,309
Sinestro's castle construct and destroying Brainiac's
drones But most importantly just obliterating

515
00:47:02,649 --> 00:47:08,792
the entire Legion team Forgefield But like from
Lex Luthor this time, he's gonna erect this

516
00:47:08,932 --> 00:47:14,398
energy dome from his battle suit around his
team So yeah, the drones and the wall are taken

517
00:47:14,458 --> 00:47:20,280
out, but not the Legion. And once that field
is down, Black Manta is immediately just going

518
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:25,941
to unleash a massive energy beam from his helmet
that sweeps across the entire Masters of Evil

519
00:47:25,981 --> 00:47:31,803
team. Big deal, they could dodge it just by
ducking. What? Yeah, they duck the beam, except

520
00:47:31,843 --> 00:47:37,764
for absorbing man who gets hit by Black Manta's
beam, but he absorbs the energy and becomes

521
00:47:37,804 --> 00:47:45,148
like this shiny red being made out of lasers.
He's gonna swing his glowing ball and chain,

522
00:47:45,408 --> 00:47:51,293
and it's gonna unleash this energy wave right
at Gorilla Grodd, just knocking him back and

523
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:56,037
frying all the hair off his body. So now he's
just like this hairless ape. I mean, jokes

524
00:47:56,097 --> 00:48:02,123
on you. You know, Absorbing Man only thinks
Grodd was there, but in reality, Grodd invaded

525
00:48:02,283 --> 00:48:08,028
Absorbing Man's mind, and he's been mentally
probing the entire Masters of Evil team and

526
00:48:08,108 --> 00:48:12,507
recognized that Absorbing Man was- probably
one of the few people on the Masters of Evil

527
00:48:12,547 --> 00:48:18,029
that he could mind control. So that's what he
did. Absorbing Man thinks he's knocked Grodd

528
00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:27,133
back, but in actuality, he lasered Baron Zemo.
Okay, uh, well Zemo sees this energy wave coming

529
00:48:27,233 --> 00:48:31,775
at him and he like dives out of the way to avoid
being hit and he's probably freaking pissed

530
00:48:31,815 --> 00:48:36,137
at Absorbing Man for attacking the wrong guy
and Absorbing Man's like, huh? What just happened?

531
00:48:37,297 --> 00:48:44,411
At which point... Zemo unholsters one of his
guns and he sprays out his adhesive X Which

532
00:48:44,611 --> 00:48:50,573
is like this sticky goo that creates this unbreakable
bond and that's just gonna cement Cheetah to

533
00:48:50,613 --> 00:48:56,134
the ground. So she can't run and she's stuck
on the ground Okay, so she'll be stuck for

534
00:48:56,194 --> 00:49:02,016
now or at least like one of her legs is but
meanwhile Solomon Grundy, you know He spotted

535
00:49:02,116 --> 00:49:06,977
Ultron and he's gonna plow right into him just
ripping off those weird antenna ears on the

536
00:49:06,997 --> 00:49:12,729
sides of his head Adamantium, man. Like Ultron
is adamantium. So Solomon Grundy isn't breaking

537
00:49:12,789 --> 00:49:19,015
shit. And Ultron's going to teach Grundy a lesson
by just trapping him in this graviton field

538
00:49:19,055 --> 00:49:24,099
and slamming him repeatedly into the ground
and then launching him right into Lex Luthor,

539
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:31,446
knocking Lex over in his war suit onto the ground.
OK, so Lex Luthor, he gets up from the ground

540
00:49:31,926 --> 00:49:38,655
and he's going to plunge this device into Solomon
Grundy's torso. before he picks up Grundy and

541
00:49:38,695 --> 00:49:43,979
a tractor beam and trolls him at whirlwind.
And whirlwind is going to see Grundy coming

542
00:49:44,279 --> 00:49:51,404
and probably slice him to pieces in this flurry
of blades. But inside Grundy was an acid bomb

543
00:49:51,504 --> 00:49:58,368
that explodes onto whirlwind and just disintegrates
his armor. Does Lex Luthor have acid bombs?

544
00:49:58,909 --> 00:50:06,786
Dude, he's a scientist. He has all kinds of
like science stuff, like chemicals. OK. Well,

545
00:50:07,306 --> 00:50:12,089
yeah, Roland just completely scatters Grundy
across the battlefield like if Grundy just

546
00:50:12,109 --> 00:50:17,992
got tossed into a blender, but Roland without
his armor is still dangerous. The armor just

547
00:50:18,012 --> 00:50:22,674
provides him protection. So Roland is going
to spin and whip up this small tornado that's

548
00:50:22,695 --> 00:50:27,177
going to lift up Black Manta into the air and
just hurl him like a half mile away from the

549
00:50:27,197 --> 00:50:32,620
battlefield. No, dude, Black Manta has a jetpack,
you know, so he could stop himself midair.

550
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:39,763
So from the air, he's going an electrified harpoon
cable at whirlwind who's spinning so fast he

551
00:50:39,783 --> 00:50:45,524
doesn't realize the cable wraps around his neck
until it's too late and his brain is just fried

552
00:50:45,544 --> 00:50:51,426
from the electricity. So that, whirlwinds out.
Oh shit. Whirlwinds the first to be out in

553
00:50:51,446 --> 00:50:58,508
the match huh? Yup. Okay, uh, well Klaue, he
sees Gorilla Grodd and Klaue's familiar with

554
00:50:58,708 --> 00:51:04,149
African animals, you know, being an adversary
to Black Panther so he is gonna generate this

555
00:51:04,169 --> 00:51:09,941
like giant leopard construct that's gonna pounce
on Gorilla Grodd and just chew him to bits

556
00:51:10,242 --> 00:51:15,126
and Grodd can't do shit about it because You
know the construct doesn't have a mind for

557
00:51:15,326 --> 00:51:21,351
Grodd to attack. I mean, but Grodd does have
telekinesis You know and in the throes of being

558
00:51:21,391 --> 00:51:27,536
attacked He's just gonna emit a telekinetic
blast that's gonna disrupt the leopards like

559
00:51:27,696 --> 00:51:33,621
sound frequency and Just cause it to dissolve
at which point Grodd's gonna send a psychic

560
00:51:33,741 --> 00:51:40,092
surge of pain through Kla, disrupting his form
as well. But he's not really susceptible to

561
00:51:40,192 --> 00:51:45,996
psychic attack because he has no physical brain.
But either way, Grodd's attack doesn't even

562
00:51:46,176 --> 00:51:53,059
finish on Kla because in the middle of it, he's
stopped by a hand on his arm. It's the Enchantress's

563
00:51:53,099 --> 00:51:58,562
hand, and she's gonna bewitch this gorilla with
a spell that turns Grodd against his teammates

564
00:51:58,763 --> 00:52:05,002
and on the side of the Masters of Evil. And
Enchantress is gonna have Grodd provide their

565
00:52:05,022 --> 00:52:10,826
entire team with psychic shielding to protect
them from mental attacks from like Brainiac.

566
00:52:11,186 --> 00:52:15,870
So like once that mental shielding is in place,
she's just gonna magically turn Gorilla Grodd

567
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:20,673
into stone. So Grodd's out of this match and
Brainiac can't do anything telepathically to

568
00:52:20,693 --> 00:52:26,557
the Masters of Evil. Dude, I did not want Gorilla
Grodd to go out this soon. Okay, well, you

569
00:52:26,677 --> 00:52:32,201
know, meanwhile Sinestro's ring has scanned
Klaue's energy signature and deduced that he's

570
00:52:32,221 --> 00:52:41,056
made of sound. So Sinestro materializes an airtight
iron maiden around Klaue and just vacuums all

571
00:52:41,076 --> 00:52:48,218
of the air out, destroying Klaue's sound form.
So now he's eliminated. All right. So then

572
00:52:48,738 --> 00:52:54,639
Black Manta and Zemo square up and Black Manta
sees Baron Zemo's sword and he pulls out his

573
00:52:54,719 --> 00:53:01,281
long daggers and he's like, sword fight, me
and you, let's go. Cool. And Zemo, you know,

574
00:53:01,301 --> 00:53:06,367
he gets into his fencing stance. and those two
go at it like parrying and slashing and stuff,

575
00:53:06,407 --> 00:53:12,891
but Zemo using his energy gauntlets, he's gonna
punch out one of Black Manta's eye pieces in

576
00:53:12,931 --> 00:53:17,654
his big ass helmet, because you know, it's just
a giant target. And as Manta is taken back

577
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:22,937
by that, Zemo is gonna stick his death ray gun
into Manta's helmet and just disintegrate Black

578
00:53:22,977 --> 00:53:29,100
Manta's head right off. Damn! So Black Manta's
out. Okay, well before Zemo can celebrate his

579
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:35,649
victory though, a disembodied... hand grabs
his ankle and he's like what? And while he's

580
00:53:35,689 --> 00:53:41,273
distracted by that another hand grabs him by
the opposite arm and just rips that thing right

581
00:53:41,373 --> 00:53:48,279
off. It's Solomon Grundy and his body has reconstituted
after being torn to pieces by whirlwind. So

582
00:53:48,399 --> 00:53:53,623
while Zemo's in shock that's when Solomon Grundy's
gonna punch his head clean right off of his

583
00:53:53,643 --> 00:53:59,248
shoulders. Geez I guess this is like super strong
Solomon Grundy now that he's reborn again.

584
00:53:59,688 --> 00:54:04,945
He's always strong. Well Absorbing Man, he sees
Ultron and he's like, you know, I could use

585
00:54:04,965 --> 00:54:11,010
some of that adamantium. So he runs over and
he's going to grab Ultron turning himself into

586
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:16,895
adamantium. And Ultron's going to shrug him
off like, don't fucking touch me. But now you're

587
00:54:16,915 --> 00:54:21,459
all in big trouble. The absorbing man is going
to confront Sinestro, who's probably going

588
00:54:21,479 --> 00:54:26,163
to throw up some kind of like demon creature
construct or something like that. But absorbing

589
00:54:26,183 --> 00:54:31,427
man is going to use Ultron's techno forming
power. to transform his ball and chain into

590
00:54:31,467 --> 00:54:35,711
this like giant hammer, kind of like what he
used when he was the Breaker of Wills in the

591
00:54:35,731 --> 00:54:41,255
Fear Itself storyline. And he's gonna use this
giant hammer to just smash through Sinestro's

592
00:54:41,295 --> 00:54:47,360
constructs and then smash Sinestro's ring on
his hand. And before Sinestro can even like

593
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:52,365
shit his pants, Absorbing Man just smashes his
head in with the adamantium hammer, and then

594
00:54:52,565 --> 00:54:58,642
Sinestro shits his pants, because he's dead.
Well, I'm confused. So, Absorbing Man- didn't

595
00:54:58,662 --> 00:55:05,184
just become adamantium, he absorbed some of
Ultron's tech into his body as well? Yeah,

596
00:55:05,244 --> 00:55:10,266
like he got his techno-forming power. He can
absorb powers as well as just the physical

597
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:15,809
states. Okay, all right. Well, you know how
one of Cheetah's feet were glued to the ground?

598
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:22,211
By now, she's nodded that thing right off and
she's pissed. And the first person she sees

599
00:55:22,712 --> 00:55:27,946
is Enchantress, just giving Cheetah Wonder Woman
vibes. And so she attacks. moving on three

600
00:55:28,006 --> 00:55:33,247
legs, slashing before Enchantress can even like
react. She does, you know, zipped by two more

601
00:55:33,287 --> 00:55:39,289
times, taking out her hands and her throat.
So Enchantress is just slashed to death before

602
00:55:39,329 --> 00:55:45,791
she could even really react. So Enchantress
is out. Um, meanwhile, I'm going to say Radioactive

603
00:55:45,831 --> 00:55:53,333
Man, uh, sees friggin' Solomon Grundy lumbering
about and he thinks he's gross. And he figures

604
00:55:53,373 --> 00:55:59,126
that the monster can't grow back if there's
nothing left to row. So basically, Radioactive

605
00:55:59,146 --> 00:56:03,568
Man just incinerates the guy. He burns every
bit of Solomon Grundy's organic tissue until

606
00:56:03,688 --> 00:56:09,671
there's nothing left but the stank. And guess
what? It must be Saturday. Well, it's Sunday.

607
00:56:10,231 --> 00:56:16,894
Except Solomon Grundy's dead, so it's Saturday.
Okay. And meanwhile, Cheetah tries to attack

608
00:56:16,994 --> 00:56:21,576
Ultron, but like, she's not gonna do anything
to him. She's not scratching him. And Ultron

609
00:56:21,616 --> 00:56:26,451
is gonna use his encephalo ray on her. which
is gonna hypnotize her into just like staying

610
00:56:26,531 --> 00:56:32,276
still for once, at which point he just energy
blasts her to pieces. So Cheetah's out. Wait,

611
00:56:32,416 --> 00:56:40,343
so who's left? Brainiac and Lex Luthor, you
have Ultron, Radioactive Man, and Absorbing

612
00:56:40,383 --> 00:56:47,229
Man? Yeah. Okay, so Absorbing Man, he's part
tech now. That's cool, because once Brainiac

613
00:56:47,289 --> 00:56:53,835
realized that, he sent out a swarm of microscopic
nanites that invaded... Absorbing man's body

614
00:56:54,115 --> 00:57:00,119
allowing brainiac to take it over and once he's
fully in control He's gonna abandon his old

615
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:06,824
body and just transmit his consciousness into
absorbing man. So now he has his power and

616
00:57:07,145 --> 00:57:11,968
absorbing that himself is out of the match like
his mind is gone and Brainiac is gonna techno

617
00:57:11,988 --> 00:57:18,153
morph his new body to resemble like an adamantium
robot skeleton and he's just gonna straight-up

618
00:57:18,333 --> 00:57:24,133
march right toward Radioactive Man, tanking
all of his blasts since radiation can't do

619
00:57:24,173 --> 00:57:31,479
much to adamantium, and Brainiac's gonna technomorph
his ball and chain into a robotic tentacle,

620
00:57:31,979 --> 00:57:37,183
and he's gonna send that out to grasp Radioactive
Man and just crush him, snapping his spine

621
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:43,547
and taking him out. Okay, I mean, like, if Brainiac
has taken over Absorbing Man, like, he's not

622
00:57:43,607 --> 00:57:50,231
just this adamantium robot now. He's also...
a guy who can absorb anything he touches, right?

623
00:57:50,651 --> 00:57:55,753
But like, if the comics have taught us anything,
absorbing man's power is not stable, you know,

624
00:57:55,813 --> 00:58:00,735
it's volatile and requires a lot of experience
so that he doesn't accidentally absorb the

625
00:58:00,775 --> 00:58:06,378
wrong properties of something. And Brainiac
doesn't know this, but Ultron does. He knows

626
00:58:06,418 --> 00:58:13,260
absorbing man's powers. So Ultron's gonna technomorph
his body to like pull moisture out of the air,

627
00:58:13,541 --> 00:58:18,351
like refrigeration technology, kinda. and the
moisture is gonna condense into water vapor

628
00:58:18,811 --> 00:58:23,955
and Ultron's gonna throw this water on Brainiac,
just dousing him, and that's gonna cause Brainiac

629
00:58:23,975 --> 00:58:29,258
to instantly turn into a puddle and disperse
into the ground. Science. That was dumb. Ha

630
00:58:29,278 --> 00:58:36,383
ha ha. That was, well, where else is Ultron
gonna get water from? I'm sure there's blood

631
00:58:36,423 --> 00:58:41,258
on the battlefield, I don't know. Okay, sure,
yeah, that's better. Ultron picks up some severed

632
00:58:41,298 --> 00:58:45,620
limb from the battleground and then like throws
some blood at Brainiac. But either way, Brainiac

633
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:51,502
turns into a puddle and is no longer in the
match. Okay, so just Lex Luthor and Ultron

634
00:58:51,542 --> 00:58:59,065
are left. Boom. EMP blast. Ultron is finished
by Lex Luthor. That was easy! You think it

635
00:58:59,085 --> 00:59:04,267
would be that easy, but when Lex Luthor tries
to shut down Ultron, little did Lex know that

636
00:59:04,327 --> 00:59:11,474
his armor was already taken over by an Ultron
Technovirus. Little did Ultron know that Lex

637
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:18,217
recognized the Ultron virus ages ago, quarantined
it, and has been wirelessly transmitting false

638
00:59:18,257 --> 00:59:23,719
data to Ultron to make him think his virus was
working when it really wasn't. Well little

639
00:59:23,739 --> 00:59:30,182
did Lex know that Ultron assumed he would attempt
some kind of failsafe against his tech virus,

640
00:59:30,542 --> 00:59:35,884
so he programmed it to make Lex's systems think
that the virus had been quarantined but in

641
00:59:35,964 --> 00:59:45,764
fact it was not. that Lex had installed the
newly upgraded Norton Antivirus Plus, now available

642
00:59:45,865 --> 00:59:53,528
to download at norton.com. I mean, little did
Lex know that McAfee is the only tried and

643
00:59:53,568 --> 01:00:01,652
true antivirus software, which you can now get
for 10% off using the code DULACHECKOUT. Not

644
01:00:01,752 --> 01:00:07,143
really, guys. Do not try to do that. Yeah. But
yeah, we could probably leave the match there.

645
01:00:07,243 --> 01:00:14,449
So either Lex Luthor discharges an EMP that
shuts down Ultron, or Ultron uploads a techno

646
01:00:14,489 --> 01:00:19,333
virus that takes over Lex Luthor's suit, shuts
it down, and then just blows up Lex Luthor.

647
01:00:19,653 --> 01:00:23,957
Sure, yeah, let's go with that. Let's find out
which one of these scenarios happens by running

648
01:00:23,997 --> 01:00:30,763
the simulations for this team battle and coming
back with the winning team. 8G9K, hit it! Inputting

649
01:00:30,803 --> 01:00:37,527
data. Running calculations. Processing results.
Simulations complete. Alright, that was a pretty

650
01:00:37,727 --> 01:00:42,230
good matchup. I had a lot of fun with that speculation.
Please do not try to download any antivirus

651
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:47,913
software using Code Duel at checkout because
it will not work. The results of the simulations

652
01:00:47,953 --> 01:00:52,936
were pretty interesting. There's a huge disparity
between the power levels of a lot of these

653
01:00:52,976 --> 01:00:59,420
characters for both of our teams. My weakest
guy was Whirlwind and his stats were way different

654
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:05,492
from my most powerful guy who was Ultron. Yeah,
comparatively, my weakest guy was Solomon Grundy,

655
01:01:05,532 --> 01:01:12,637
who was by far the weakest member of either
team, though Brainiac was the strongest member

656
01:01:12,797 --> 01:01:18,621
of either team. So I had both the weakest and
the strongest guys. Yeah, Solomon Grundy is

657
01:01:18,761 --> 01:01:23,984
not impressive statistically, like at all. Poor
guy. But like Brainiac is so overpowered, he

658
01:01:24,024 --> 01:01:29,608
almost has no business being in this match.
Which I love. So you kind of have that going

659
01:01:29,648 --> 01:01:35,852
for and against you. A lot of your guys actually
had winning records against the Masters of

660
01:01:35,932 --> 01:01:41,595
Evil, including Lex Luther, Brainiac, Gorilla
Grodd won a majority of his matches, so did

661
01:01:41,775 --> 01:01:47,178
Sinestro, which is quite impressive. The only
guys on my team that had winning records were

662
01:01:47,458 --> 01:01:53,802
Ultron, Enchantress, and Klawe. The rest of
them won around a quarter to a third of their

663
01:01:53,822 --> 01:01:59,225
matches. Freakin' Solomon Grundy though only
won 8% out of all of his battles, his thousands

664
01:01:59,245 --> 01:02:04,982
of battles. Yeah, that threw my average off
big time. The lowest guy for you was what,

665
01:02:05,022 --> 01:02:10,987
22% win rate? Yeah, Roland won about a quarter
of his matches. So averaging it all out and

666
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:15,431
considering all the stats, who do you think
is going to win this match? Oh, it's got to

667
01:02:15,451 --> 01:02:24,158
be the Legion of Doom. And Instagram wholeheartedly
agrees with me. 74% of our Instagram poll takers

668
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:28,381
said that the Legion was going to win. And that's
why I'm going to say that poll is full of crap.

669
01:02:28,822 --> 01:02:34,786
But let's go ahead and get the real results.
AG9K, the results please. Hey, Yuasa. All right,

670
01:02:34,827 --> 01:02:44,254
the winner in the team duel between the Legion
of Doom and the Masters of Evil is the Masters

671
01:02:44,294 --> 01:02:51,620
of Evil. The what? The Legion of Doom. Wait,
wait, wait. I tried to fake you out right there,

672
01:02:51,681 --> 01:02:58,003
but no, I couldn't do it. The Legion of Doom
won, and it wasn't that close. They won 56.9%

673
01:02:58,943 --> 01:03:06,265
of the time over the Masters of Evil, 43.1%.
So averaging out to 1000 simulated battles,

674
01:03:06,765 --> 01:03:13,447
Legion of Doom won 569, and Masters of Evil
won 431. Yeah, that's a pretty solid win percentage

675
01:03:13,547 --> 01:03:20,509
for Team DC here. Just goes to show that quantity
of years of comic book history does not equate

676
01:03:20,569 --> 01:03:28,555
to quality on the battlefield. This is bullshit.
It's so lame losing to a team that's like barely

677
01:03:28,595 --> 01:03:32,456
even a fucking team. They were invented in the
cartoon and then they like made one appearance

678
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:38,418
in the comics. They're a real team in our hearts,
Joseph. In our hearts. That's what counts.

679
01:03:38,978 --> 01:03:44,999
That's stupid. You're stupid. Clearly for choosing
the losing team. Your face is stupid. Your

680
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:52,141
face looks like my face, which also makes your
face stupid. Damn it! Just quit while you're

681
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:56,287
behind. That does it for this team duel. Let
