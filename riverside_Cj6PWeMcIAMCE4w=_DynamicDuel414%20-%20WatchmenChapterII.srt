00:01:12,814 --> 00:01:18,718
Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we
review superhero films and debate the superiority

7
00:01:18,738 --> 00:01:24,722
between Marvel and DC by comparing their characters
in stat-based battle simulations. I'm Johnny

8
00:01:24,762 --> 00:01:30,847
DC. And I'm his twin brother Marvelous Joe.
And in this episode, we are reviewing the conclusion

9
00:01:31,167 --> 00:01:38,072
of the two-part Watchmen animated adaptation
Watchmen Chapter 2. I can't say I was looking

10
00:01:38,153 --> 00:01:43,733
forward to watching it. because the first one
I thought was very, very redundant. And you'll

11
00:01:43,753 --> 00:01:48,098
find out later on in this episode whether I
thought the same about chapter two. So Jonathan,

12
00:01:48,138 --> 00:01:54,183
I was thinking we watched the Watchmen, right?
And the listeners are listening to us talk

13
00:01:54,204 --> 00:02:00,089
about watching the Watchmen. So are they watching
us watch the Watchmen? They're the watchers

14
00:02:00,109 --> 00:02:04,493
of the Watchmen watching the Watchmen. Answering
the real philosophical questions on this podcast.

15
00:02:04,962 --> 00:02:08,605
Before we dive even more into the philosophy
of the Watchmen, we're going to break down

16
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:13,149
the comic book movie news from the past week,
of which there was just one news item, and

17
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:19,635
that was the reveal that Rob Hardy is the cinematographer
for Supergirl Woman of Tomorrow. As always

38
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,122
out of the way, quick to the No Prize! A No
Prize is an award Marvel used to give out to

39
00:04:33,162 --> 00:04:37,963
fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel No Prize,
is a digital award that we post on Instagram

40
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:42,865
for the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week we asked

41
00:04:42,905 --> 00:04:47,122
you guys, or not last week, it was like two
weeks ago, we asked... What Marvel character

42
00:04:47,343 --> 00:04:54,088
would you cast former 007 actor George Lazenby
as and why? And this is coming off of the news

43
00:04:54,108 --> 00:05:00,874
that Daniel Craig is currently negotiating a
deal with DC to play Sergeant Rock in an upcoming

44
00:05:01,014 --> 00:05:06,339
Sergeant Rock film. And I, being a huge 007
James Bond fan, was super jealous because it

45
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:11,664
seems like all the currently living Bond actors
have gotten DC roles but not Marvel roles.

46
00:05:11,704 --> 00:05:16,002
Of course, you had Pierce Brosnan as Dr. Fate.
You had Timothy Dalton as the chief from Doom

47
00:05:16,022 --> 00:05:21,504
Patrol. You even had Sean Connery as Alan Quartermaine
in the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, which

48
00:05:21,544 --> 00:05:26,465
came from a DC imprint. George Lazenby though,
he's still kicking, and we gotta get him a

49
00:05:26,505 --> 00:05:31,666
Marvel role so that we could have some 007 in
the MCU. And we got a lot of answers actually.

50
00:05:32,046 --> 00:05:35,987
Yeah, way more than I thought we would actually
get. We're gonna break down this week's honorable

51
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:42,529
mentions before revealing the no prize winner.
Our first honorable mention goes to Cyrus Moore,

52
00:05:42,869 --> 00:05:48,084
who said, Hey guys, Cyrus Moore here. Uh, George
Lazenby would be a perfect old man Hawkeye,

53
00:05:48,445 --> 00:05:54,069
I believe. And DC side, just I know you guys
didn't ask, but I think he'd be a perfect Alan

54
00:05:54,089 --> 00:06:01,514
Scott. Uh, but old man Hawkeye? Oh, that'd be
fantastic. He's kind of already got the look

55
00:06:01,554 --> 00:06:08,054
that matches the old man Hawkeye comic book
series, so it just be flawless. Yeah, that's

56
00:06:08,094 --> 00:06:12,117
a fantastic answer. You know, Old Man Hawkeye
is a character established in the world of

57
00:06:12,137 --> 00:06:16,399
the Old Man Logan series, and Old Man Hawkeye
even got his own comic book. George Lazenby,

58
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:19,562
I think, would be great in the role. Not just
because, like, he has a great sense of humor,

59
00:06:19,682 --> 00:06:24,425
but also because I feel like George Lazenby
is kind of, like, seen as the Hawkeye of the

60
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:28,448
James Bond actors, and that he doesn't seem
quite as relevant because he was only in one

61
00:06:28,508 --> 00:06:32,290
film, so, yeah, I think there's a lot of through
lines there, and I think Lazenby could pull

62
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:38,826
it off. How old is George Lazenby? Uh, dude
is 85 years old right now. Oh snap. Yeah, pretty

63
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:43,747
up there. Well, I mean, Ellen Scott is an old
guy. I could totally see George Lazenby playing

64
00:06:43,787 --> 00:06:48,529
Kim. Like you'd probably have to do CG work
for the action shots, but just do it from far

65
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:53,610
away. It'll be it'll work out. It'll work out.
Plus, George Lazenby is pretty dapper, as is

66
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:58,191
Ellen Scott. I actually think Ellen Scott would
be a better choice for George Lazenby than

67
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:02,532
Old Man Hawkeye. You might be right, because
like Old Man Hawkeye has long hair. And I don't

68
00:07:02,552 --> 00:07:06,413
know if I could see Lazenby pulling off that
look. Our next honorable mention goes to Mike

69
00:07:06,453 --> 00:07:07,414
Williams. who said,

70
00:07:27,966 --> 00:07:33,010
Yeah, coming off of our recent duel matchup
of Black Mask versus Madame Mask, I think this

71
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:37,413
was a great answer. We know that Madame Mask,
of course, is the daughter of Count Nefaria,

72
00:07:37,814 --> 00:07:43,979
who was a leader within the Magia crime family
in the world of Marvel. And yeah, I could totally

73
00:07:44,019 --> 00:07:49,784
see Laysen be as like the patriarch of a mafia
crime family for sure. Yeah, that would be

74
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:54,828
kind of cool. Almost like a Marlon Brando-esque
type role. There you go. Yeah. Take that vibe

75
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:59,135
and then add superpowers to it. I think you
got yourself a good Count Nefaria with George

76
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:04,659
Lazenby in the role. Great answer, Mike! Our
next honorable mention goes to Mason Thompson,

77
00:08:05,059 --> 00:08:11,704
who said, Hey guys, so first thing I saw when
I looked at some photos of him, Uncle Ben.

78
00:08:12,265 --> 00:08:17,248
Maybe he's in the multiverse as an Uncle Ben.
And he comes to our universe, gives our universe,

79
00:08:17,268 --> 00:08:22,552
the Spider-Man, a little motivation, something
like that. But if we're talking like Prime,

80
00:08:22,612 --> 00:08:28,100
when he was in his Prime, he's He's Tony Stark.
Look at him and tell me he's not Tony Stark.

81
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:34,265
Give him a little goatee and he's Iron Man.
Great answer. Yeah, actually, Uncle Ben was

82
00:08:34,325 --> 00:08:38,309
the answer that I immediately thought of. And
I was really hoping like people out there would

83
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:43,153
come up with better options than just having
him as Uncle Ben. But the problem I had with

84
00:08:43,193 --> 00:08:47,837
casting George Lazenby as Uncle Ben is that
even though he looks exactly like him nowadays,

85
00:08:48,037 --> 00:08:54,798
the MCU Uncle Ben would have to be a lot younger
to have dated Marissa Tomei's. Aunt May, right?

86
00:08:55,258 --> 00:08:59,081
Maybe. But then Mason Thompson reminded me that
the multiverse is a thing, so he could always

87
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:05,526
be a multiversal Uncle Ben. I think it totally
works. Mason also went on to say that the prime

88
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:10,529
version of George Lazenby, you know, back in
1969 when he played Bond, would make a great

89
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:15,232
Tony Stark. And I don't disagree. I think a
lot of the James Bond actors would make a great

90
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:21,877
Tony Stark. In fact, if I recall correctly,
artist Alex Ross paints his version of Tony

91
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:27,448
Stark. in the likeness of Timothy Dalton, who
was another James Bond actor. Oh, man, I need

92
00:09:27,468 --> 00:09:33,611
to look this up. Yeah, look up Alex Ross, Tony
Stark. Oh, holy cow, he does. That's awesome.

93
00:09:34,072 --> 00:09:38,554
So there are definitely like parallels between
the Stark and James Bond character. And thanks

94
00:09:38,574 --> 00:09:43,377
to Mason Thompson for reminding us all about
that. I want to give a quick shout out to Colby

95
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:49,364
Hentges, who. called in with the answer of Silvermane,
but also suggested that Aaron Taylor Johnson

96
00:09:49,604 --> 00:09:54,627
would be a good choice for the next 007 after
Daniel Craig, and he's totally my choice as

97
00:09:54,667 --> 00:10:01,170
well. Also shout out to Judson Batty, who actually
gave a DC answer. He said George Lazenbeek

98
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:06,813
could play Uncle Marvel from the Captain Marvel
Shazam family. And a dishonorable mention to

99
00:10:06,893 --> 00:10:12,516
Miggy for not having the imagination or trust
in his fellow listeners to produce answers

100
00:10:12,556 --> 00:10:20,301
for this question. It was just crickets. But
he said on behalf of everybody. But the winner

101
00:10:20,321 --> 00:10:26,742
of this week's snow prize is Brandon Estregard,
who said. Hey guys, I would cast George Lazenby

102
00:10:26,802 --> 00:10:32,665
as the original human torch, Jim Hammond, for
three reasons. One, they were both ornate created

103
00:10:32,705 --> 00:10:38,648
in the same year, 1939, which was also the year
that World War II started. Two, you can cast

104
00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:42,989
him at his current age and give him a cameo
like how Hank had his World War II amman cameo

105
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:50,453
in the original amman movie. And three, every
Bond actor deserves an iconic role. I really

106
00:10:50,473 --> 00:10:55,772
liked this answer. Of course, Brandon said that...
George Liza to be could play the original Human

107
00:10:55,792 --> 00:11:02,356
Torch, who was the superhero on the very first
issue of the very first Marvel comic book ever.

108
00:11:02,717 --> 00:11:06,720
The original Human Torch was not a member of
the Fantastic Four. Of course, Marvel fans

109
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:12,744
know that he was an android named Jim Hammond,
who was created by Dr. Phineas Horton. I go

110
00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:17,227
a little bit into his backstory in the Vision
vs. Marsha Manhunter duel episode that we have.

111
00:11:17,667 --> 00:11:23,652
But yeah, the android was actually briefly featured.
in the Captain America movie when Steve Rogers

112
00:11:23,672 --> 00:11:29,017
and Bucky went to the World's Fair with their
dates. Jim Hammond's Human Torch was a hugely

113
00:11:29,057 --> 00:11:34,942
influential World War II hero and it would be
really cool to see him show up in the MCU as

114
00:11:34,982 --> 00:11:39,166
George Lazenby. I thought it was a really cool
factoid that Brandon pointed out that the Human

115
00:11:39,226 --> 00:11:45,211
Torch comic book character and George Lazenby
were both born in the same year of 1939. Yeah,

116
00:11:45,231 --> 00:11:49,430
it might be even cool to see that version of
the Human Torch. appear in the upcoming Vision

117
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:54,313
television series, considering the character's
backstory. Oh yeah, that would be totally great.

118
00:11:54,733 --> 00:11:59,896
No matter how it happens, we just gotta get
this Bond actor in a Marvel role, cuz screw

119
00:11:59,916 --> 00:12:04,899
DC for taking in all the 007 actors. But thanks
to everyone who called in, congrats to Brandon

120
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:08,040
Eschergard for winning this week's No Prize.
If you the listener want a shot at winning

121
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,263
your own No Prize, stay tuned to later on this
episode when we'll be asking another question

122
00:12:12,303 --> 00:12:18,753
of the week. And now that that's done… No SCREW
MARVEL! And onto the news!

123
00:12:24,654 --> 00:12:31,876
Alright, over a week ago, James Gunn revealed
on threads in a conversation there that Rob

124
00:12:31,957 --> 00:12:38,319
Hardy, a veteran cinematographer in Hollywood,
will be doing the cinematography for the upcoming

125
00:12:38,419 --> 00:12:44,302
Supergirl Woman of Tomorrow film. That film
of course is starring Millie Alcock as Supergirl

126
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:51,405
and is based on the comic of the same title.
Now, this news is pretty awesome because the

127
00:12:51,445 --> 00:12:57,801
comic Supergirl Woman of Tomorrow takes place
across the cosmos and visits different planets

128
00:12:57,941 --> 00:13:03,866
and it looks really awesome. The art in the
comic is fantastic. So to get someone of Rob

129
00:13:03,906 --> 00:13:08,429
Hardy's caliber to do the cinematography for
it makes it seem like the movie is just going

130
00:13:08,469 --> 00:13:14,875
to be breathtaking to watch. Rob Hardy has done
cinematography on prior films that include

131
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:22,821
Ex Machina, Annihilation, Mission Impossible
Fallout, Men, and Civil War among other films.

132
00:13:23,134 --> 00:13:27,076
Yeah, a lot of those movies have a very grounded
approach to the cinematography, I would say,

133
00:13:27,096 --> 00:13:31,900
with probably Annihilation being the exception.
I'm assuming he's going to pull largely from

134
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,844
that experience to direct the photography for
Supergirl Woman of Tomorrow. Yeah, yeah, I

135
00:13:37,884 --> 00:13:43,248
think Annihilation is a good precedent for what
he could do with the film in terms of her visiting

136
00:13:43,308 --> 00:13:49,553
these alien worlds. DC has had some amazing
cinematography in their past films. You can

137
00:13:49,573 --> 00:13:54,787
take a look at... The Batman, the Joker films,
Marvel films, their best one was probably what,

138
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:59,488
The Eternals? For the MCU, yeah, I would say
the best cinematography was The Eternals or

139
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:03,729
maybe Guardians. Prior to that, I think the
Sam Raimi, Spider-Man films had great cinematography.

140
00:14:04,189 --> 00:14:09,091
Cinematographers aren't as renowned as directors,
but they contribute a lot to the look of the

141
00:14:09,131 --> 00:14:14,692
film. And I gotta say, Rob Hardy joining Supergirl
makes me really excited for how that film is

142
00:14:14,732 --> 00:14:18,633
going to look. I've yet to hear like really
anything bad about that film. It looks like

143
00:14:18,673 --> 00:14:24,071
it's shaping up to be really something special.
But speaking of cinematographers, that brings

144
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:25,532
us to our question of the week.

153
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:17,227
Well that does it for all the news for this
episode, but now let's go ahead and move on

154
00:15:17,267 --> 00:15:24,177
to the main event where we review the animated
adaptation Watchmen Chapter 2.

155
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:46,164
Watchmen Chapter 2 is the second half of a two-part
animated adaptation of the comic medium's seminal

156
00:15:46,224 --> 00:15:52,627
masterpiece created by writer Alan Moore and
artist Dave Gibbons. It concludes the mystery

157
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:58,550
of a killer targeting retired crime-fighting
vigilantes in New York City amidst escalating

158
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:04,913
global tensions and the threat of nuclear armageddon
at the height of the Cold War. It's a satirical

159
00:16:04,973 --> 00:16:11,872
examination of superhero comics that revolutionized
the comic medium in the 1980s. And because

160
00:16:11,932 --> 00:16:18,276
it was so narratively complex and perfectly
suited to the comic medium, it was long considered

161
00:16:18,656 --> 00:16:24,499
unadaptable to screen. Of course, you know,
until the 2009 live action film by Zack Snyder,

162
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:30,843
but even that was met with mixed reactions.
15 years after that, Warner Brothers has attempted

163
00:16:30,943 --> 00:16:36,750
another on-screen adaptation, this time split
into two parts, chapters one and two. with

164
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:43,456
our podcast being the only tomato meter approved
publication that gave chapter one a rotten

165
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:49,681
rating, saying in our review that despite the
filmmakers best intentions, the film is faithful

166
00:16:49,721 --> 00:16:55,707
to a fault, and in essence, it's an abridged
and superfluous version of the celebrated graphic

167
00:16:55,767 --> 00:17:00,912
novel. Well, it just means that we have integrity,
okay? We're willing to call out something as

168
00:17:00,992 --> 00:17:06,746
bad if we perceive it to be bad. And I definitely
don't think it was deserving of a 100% Rotten

169
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:12,448
Tomato rating, because after watching Chapter
1, I concluded that the story of Watchmen is

170
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:18,390
too good and too important to justify an abridged
version. But if you're going to condense the

171
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:23,971
story into something easier to consume on screen,
then we already have a better, more cinematic

172
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:30,293
abridged version in the live-action film. And
this animated adaptation, in its ambition to

173
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:35,920
be even more faithful to the graphic novel,
makes itself redundant and less special. We

174
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:41,343
speculated in our review of Chapter 1 that because
of the ramped up tension in the latter half

175
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:49,269
of the story, Chapter 2 is probably going to
be better, and it is, but just barely. So I'm

176
00:17:49,329 --> 00:17:54,593
not going to recommend watching this movie.
I am going to recommend everyone read the graphic

177
00:17:54,633 --> 00:18:00,637
novel though, and if you're going to, stop listening
to the spoiler review now because it will also

178
00:18:00,757 --> 00:18:05,346
spoil the book. And if you're not going to read
the book, then I would recommend pairing the

179
00:18:05,526 --> 00:18:13,189
2009 Zack Snyder film with the 2019 HBO Watchmen
series. With the understanding that the end

180
00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:18,950
explosion was caused by different sources, though.
I don't care. I just don't recommend this two

181
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:24,191
part animated adaptation. I will agree, though,
that this chapter two film was better than

182
00:18:24,232 --> 00:18:29,593
chapter one. Right. Yeah. Now, I went on at
length as to why Watchmen is such a celebrated

183
00:18:29,653 --> 00:18:35,347
story in our review of Chapter one. So I won't
repeat any of that here. What I will say is

184
00:18:35,367 --> 00:18:40,070
that I regret that Warner Brothers' animation
didn't release both chapters simultaneously,

185
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:46,334
because releasing the story in two parts, I
feel, didn't allow the story's tension to build

186
00:18:46,514 --> 00:18:52,758
and conclude in one unified experience. So the
narrative's most powerful moments, especially

187
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:58,841
the final moral quandaries, lose some of their
impact because of the rushed nature of this

188
00:18:58,901 --> 00:19:05,457
second half. There's a ton more story here from
the books that was cut or rushed through than

189
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:10,760
there was in Chapter 1, and because of that,
the lead villain of the story doesn't even

190
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:17,744
debut in this film until the final act. Both
Chapters 1 and 2 were just shy of 90 minutes

191
00:19:17,844 --> 00:19:23,767
each, putting them combined at under 3 hours,
which is shorter than the director's cut of

192
00:19:23,827 --> 00:19:29,074
Zack Snyder's Watchmen, and that's still my
favorite adaptation. I'm afraid this means

193
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:34,199
that there was no reason to split the story
in two parts other than corporate greed on

194
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:39,624
behalf of Warner Brothers. Like no reason. If
they wanted to do the graphic novel justice,

195
00:19:39,924 --> 00:19:44,348
which I'm now convinced as I mentioned in our
last review, that the only way to have done

196
00:19:44,388 --> 00:19:50,233
that was a 12 episode animated series. For sure,
or live action series. I still hope to see

197
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:56,030
that one day. maybe as, you know, another HBO
series where every issue of the Watchmen graphic

198
00:19:56,090 --> 00:20:01,374
novel is an episode of the series. If they could
do a series that was like in the same vein

199
00:20:01,494 --> 00:20:07,659
aesthetically as something like Blade Runner,
I think that would be absolute perfection.

200
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:11,402
Yeah, Blade Runner is a little sci-fi, but if
you could like throw in some like taxi driver

201
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:16,306
type vibe, like make the television series really
feel like the time period that it's set in,

202
00:20:16,426 --> 00:20:21,542
like it was made during that time. I think that
would be mind-blowing. Absolutely. 100% agree.

203
00:20:22,002 --> 00:20:27,206
Now, my gripes aside, I do have to say that
I did actually think this film was enjoyable.

204
00:20:27,466 --> 00:20:32,069
There's a lot more action in the second half
than there was in the first in more ways than

205
00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:35,110
one, if you know what I mean. I don't know what
you mean. What do you mean, Jonathan? What

206
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:43,075
do you mean by that? You know, action. What
does that mean? OK, virgin sex. That's what

207
00:20:43,095 --> 00:20:49,383
I mean. From the prison fights with Rorschach.
to the escapades of Night Owl and Silk Spectre,

208
00:20:49,684 --> 00:20:54,788
to the actually good climax we got this time
at the end of the film, the movie moves at

209
00:20:54,808 --> 00:20:59,852
a pretty brisk pace, even with the tales of
the Black Freighter interludes. That said,

210
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:05,716
for all the action it had, I felt Chapter 2
absolutely dropped the ball on the underlying

211
00:21:05,776 --> 00:21:11,100
tension of nuclear war that the book expertly
managed to balance along with the character

212
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:17,752
drama. Like- There was only one brief scene
with Richard Nixon in this film. And to me,

213
00:21:17,812 --> 00:21:24,036
the adaptation struggled to capture the moral
gravity that defined the source material, that

214
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:30,199
Cold War-era fear of nuclear Armageddon that
loomed over every scene in the comic, creating

215
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:35,342
this almost suffocating tension and urgency
to the characters' struggles, as well as their

216
00:21:35,402 --> 00:21:40,525
moral compromises. The heart of Watchmen, for
many readers, I think, has always been its

217
00:21:40,585 --> 00:21:47,508
commentary. on humanity's capacity for self-destruction
and the horrifying lengths one might go to

218
00:21:47,888 --> 00:21:53,630
in order to prevent it. That's the moral of
the story, right? We are creatures who stand

219
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:59,513
on the brink of annihilation and any solution
to that problem can be as monstrous as the

220
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:06,496
threat itself. Watchmen Chapter 2 does present
Ozymandias' terrible solution in full detail,

221
00:22:06,776 --> 00:22:12,238
Giant Squid and all, which is something previous
adaptations have shied away from. but without

222
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:18,399
the nuclear dread consistently simmering throughout
the narrative, the final twist feels more like

223
00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:26,181
a shock tactic than this culmination of the
existential anxieties from that era. I wonder

224
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:31,743
if the animation has anything to do with that.
It's kind of just really hard to connect with

225
00:22:31,903 --> 00:22:37,745
anything that you're seeing on the screen due
to the rather stiff nature of it all. Yeah,

226
00:22:37,805 --> 00:22:45,043
as we mentioned in our review of Chapter 1,
the animation for this film particularly now

227
00:22:45,063 --> 00:22:50,907
that I've seen Suicide Squad Isekai, which we
reviewed after Chapter 1. Suicide Squad Isekai

228
00:22:50,927 --> 00:22:58,391
has kind of ruined, in a way, all DC animation
for me because it is, I would say, DC's best

229
00:22:58,491 --> 00:23:04,835
animated project that it's ever done and way
better in comparison to the animation that

230
00:23:04,855 --> 00:23:10,891
was done for Watchmen, unfortunately. Tragically
even. Like imagine what this squid exploding

231
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:16,296
scene would have been like in anime style. That
would have been incredible. Like Akira? Yeah,

232
00:23:16,316 --> 00:23:20,579
like I was just gonna say Akira. Yeah, that's
what it kind of reminded me of. The nuclear

233
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:25,403
Armageddon felt secondary until the very end
of the film, which devotes most of its running

234
00:23:25,443 --> 00:23:31,869
time to the Mask Killer mystery and only fully
acknowledges the specter of nuclear war after

235
00:23:31,989 --> 00:23:37,253
Ozymandias' plan has been fully revealed and
executed. And I think that was a huge mistake.

236
00:23:37,618 --> 00:23:42,941
especially during these times when we still
live under the threat of nuclear war. You know,

237
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:48,864
the doomsday clock that is used as a motif throughout
the comics series is a real thing. And currently

238
00:23:48,904 --> 00:23:55,308
we're at, I think, 90 seconds to midnight as
of this recording, which is wild. I mean, we

239
00:23:55,328 --> 00:24:01,011
got more than a whole minute left before humanity's
destruction. Oh, okay. I'm feeling pretty good.

240
00:24:01,651 --> 00:24:06,434
Let me know when it's like 15 seconds, then
I'll start shitting my pants. One thing I noticed

241
00:24:06,454 --> 00:24:11,616
from Chapter 2 is that it seemed like they actually
diverted more from the source material than

242
00:24:11,676 --> 00:24:18,499
Chapter 1 did. Like I saw a few new scenes,
a lot more original dialogue, and I remember

243
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:22,461
thinking to myself like, what the fuck did they
just say? Like, what is this? Like, when did

244
00:24:22,501 --> 00:24:27,704
Hollis Mason go back and visit Dan Dreiberg?
Since when did we spend so much time on Archie,

245
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:32,006
you know? It wasn't a bad adaptation and we
really came down on Chapter 1 for... being

246
00:24:32,066 --> 00:24:36,088
a little bit too faithful and maybe they hurt
us. Maybe that's why they added all this extra

247
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:41,351
stuff. I don't know. I doubt it. They've been
working on this film for three years. So I

248
00:24:41,371 --> 00:24:47,854
don't think it was us. Their one negative Rotten
Tomatoes review. I doubt it. But no, I definitely

249
00:24:47,914 --> 00:24:53,277
noticed those extra scenes. They were definitely
drawing to me as well. And I don't mind them

250
00:24:53,758 --> 00:24:59,401
condensing the story. It was just the writing
that I felt was off. Like Shazinsky, the writer

251
00:24:59,761 --> 00:25:07,148
of this film. is a really good comic book writer,
but he's no Alan Moore. And when you hear lines

252
00:25:07,248 --> 00:25:13,010
like, your butt is in safe hands, it better
be or else I'm gonna kick it. I'm just like,

253
00:25:13,391 --> 00:25:19,873
what the fuck is this? I thought the exact same
thing when I heard that line. I was like, this

254
00:25:19,953 --> 00:25:25,696
chapter two adaptation has way too much butt
stuff. Like I remember when Dan and Lori were

255
00:25:25,716 --> 00:25:30,057
about to get it on the couch the first time,
there was a whole shot of her slapping his

256
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:35,124
ass. just out of the blue. Like they cut to
that specifically. And I was like, that was

257
00:25:35,184 --> 00:25:40,187
never in the comic book. What the fuck was that?
And on Archie. I didn't need to see that. There's

258
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:45,390
a lot of butt stuff going on in chapter two
of Watchmen. A lot of ass kicking and ass slapping.

259
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:50,673
But yeah, that line was just groan worthy. It's
one of several changes where I'm like, that

260
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:56,896
was unnecessary. Like honestly, looking back
on these two films, I kind of wish they would

261
00:25:56,936 --> 00:26:01,414
have cut the tales from the Black Friday. because
it would have given them more room to include

262
00:26:01,854 --> 00:26:07,496
some more of the better stuff from the books.
Yeah, I think the parallels that they tried

263
00:26:07,536 --> 00:26:12,437
to draw between the story of the Black Frater
and the story of Watchmen did not work as well

264
00:26:12,457 --> 00:26:17,459
within this adaptation. No, I disagree. I actually
think some of the parallels they made were

265
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:22,600
more successful than what they did in the comic.
But that doesn't mean it was necessary. What

266
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,081
is the moral of the Black Frater? What's the
lesson there and how does it pertain to the

267
00:26:26,101 --> 00:26:30,276
story of Watchmen? Well, it has like this meta
context with a lot of things that are going

268
00:26:30,336 --> 00:26:36,661
on within the story intentionally. But overall,
I would say that it tells the story of this

269
00:26:36,781 --> 00:26:43,707
man who has gone through these horrible tragedies
and kind of lost his soul. In the same way,

270
00:26:43,787 --> 00:26:50,152
you could make connections between that and
Rorschach or Ozymandias in coming to the conclusion

271
00:26:50,412 --> 00:26:55,477
that he felt he had to come up with in order
to save mankind. He became a monster in much

272
00:26:55,517 --> 00:27:00,732
the same way that the sailor from Tales of the
Black Frader did. Except the sailor learned

273
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:06,655
his lesson whereas Ozymandias did not. Maybe,
maybe, we don't know. I'm just gonna say now,

274
00:27:07,976 --> 00:27:12,378
hot take, I don't think Tales from the Black
Frader is necessary at all even in the comic

275
00:27:12,398 --> 00:27:17,421
book. The parallels that it tries to draw are
just too thin to hold much weight in the larger

276
00:27:17,461 --> 00:27:23,704
context. Fight me. Okay, I will fight you with
my fists. Not with any kind of argument against

277
00:27:23,744 --> 00:27:31,028
that. Yeah, yeah, those are frightening words,
my friend. Your opinion is trash. Here's a

278
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:36,551
punch to the face. Exactly. You get it. I like
Tales of the Black Freighter, but I have not

279
00:27:36,591 --> 00:27:41,734
liked it in any other adaptation. Like, I didn't
even really enjoy it in the ultimate cut of

280
00:27:41,774 --> 00:27:46,536
the Watchmen film. The live action one by Zack
Snyder. They made an animated version of the

281
00:27:46,556 --> 00:27:51,139
Tales from the Black Freighter and cut it into
the movie. But honestly, as I said earlier,

282
00:27:51,459 --> 00:27:56,602
the director's cut without that is still my
favorite adaptation of Watchmen. I rest my

283
00:27:56,662 --> 00:28:01,667
case. If they ever did a TV show though, like
a 12 part series, I could see them leaving

284
00:28:01,747 --> 00:28:06,511
it in. Yeah, at that point, I think you'd almost
need to just to fill the runtime. Yeah. Let's

285
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:10,635
go ahead and move on to the character breakdown,
though I will say I don't have anything to

286
00:28:10,775 --> 00:28:15,880
add regarding the voice performances that I
have already said in our review of Chapter

287
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:22,045
1. So I'm going to skip over all of that. But
let's start with Rorschach, aka Walter Kovacs.

288
00:28:22,706 --> 00:28:27,589
After being captured by police and accused of
the murder of Malik, Rorschach is forced into

289
00:28:27,629 --> 00:28:32,953
a prison where he's surrounded by hundreds of
criminals he helped put behind bars. Despite

290
00:28:32,993 --> 00:28:37,756
this, Rorschach shows no fear, even going so
far as to tell the prisoners that he's not

291
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:43,200
locked up with them, they're locked up with
him, and proving as much in how he's able to

292
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:49,344
disable their attacks. We see how his hardened
view of the world was shaped by his upbringing,

293
00:28:49,624 --> 00:28:54,751
being the offspring of a prostitute. and teased
for it growing up. And choosing the life of

294
00:28:54,771 --> 00:29:00,875
a crime fighter showed him the absolute worst
in humanity, shaping his viewpoint that life

295
00:29:00,975 --> 00:29:07,739
is random and meaningless with no pattern save
for what we impose on it. And Rorschach imposes

296
00:29:07,799 --> 00:29:14,943
his own strict black and white morality, deontological
and uncompromising, which is why he's killed

297
00:29:14,983 --> 00:29:21,691
by Dr. Manhattan in the end. Because his inability
to compromise to allow a little evil for a

298
00:29:21,731 --> 00:29:26,435
greater good would lead to greater harm. I do
wish that they would have taken a little bit

299
00:29:26,455 --> 00:29:31,479
more time with his personal backstory that is
revealed during his sessions with the psychiatrist.

300
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:35,582
Super rushed. It does seem like he rushed through
it. Oh yeah. And to me that was always one

301
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:39,585
of the more interesting parts of the Watchman's
story, how this man kind of just fell into

302
00:29:39,605 --> 00:29:45,399
the void. Yeah, absolutely. I think if Watchmen
had a protagonist, it probably would be Rorschach,

303
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,740
but I definitely feel like he didn't get as
much screen time as like Dan and Laurie in

304
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:55,602
this adaptation. I feel like they were treated
as the protagonists, which isn't bad. You know,

305
00:29:55,622 --> 00:30:00,203
I don't mind Night Owl. He's probably one of
my favorite characters. Speaking of him, you

306
00:30:00,223 --> 00:30:05,504
know, after returning to vigilantism alongside
Laurie, Dan Dreiberg finds a renewed sense

307
00:30:05,525 --> 00:30:11,367
of purpose he lacked since giving up his Night
Owl persona. rediscovering the thrill and meaning

308
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:16,912
in what he does, whether it's rescuing people
from a burning building or orchestrating Rorschach's

309
00:30:16,952 --> 00:30:24,018
jailbreak. As he uncovers Adrian Veidt's plan,
Dan is forced to confront his own ideals. He

310
00:30:24,058 --> 00:30:29,102
sees the bigger picture and understands that
sometimes terrible sacrifices need to be accepted

311
00:30:29,142 --> 00:30:34,707
for the greater good. Unlike Rorschach, Dan
can compromise, and it allows him to let go

312
00:30:34,847 --> 00:30:39,551
and embrace a new life with Laurie. As they
reinvent themselves, and find a peace in the

313
00:30:39,591 --> 00:30:45,358
world that Adrian has created. I liked Dan more
in Chapter 2 than I did in Chapter 1. Chapter

314
00:30:45,498 --> 00:30:50,904
1, I found it difficult to avoid comparing Night
Owl's on-screen performance to Patrick Wilson's

315
00:30:51,024 --> 00:30:56,691
from the 2009 live-action film, but with Chapter
2 maybe a little bit less so because Chapter

316
00:30:56,711 --> 00:31:02,103
2 is really where the character comes into his
own. The moment when he was explaining to Laurie

317
00:31:02,163 --> 00:31:07,706
how he just felt impotent because of all the
pressure surrounding the events worldwide and

318
00:31:07,947 --> 00:31:13,670
locally, I really connected with. It felt believable
to me in a way that felt a little bit more

319
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:18,393
palpable than even the comic book. Maybe, I
don't know. In this movie, I think he came

320
00:31:18,433 --> 00:31:23,496
across as much more confident earlier on in
the story than he was in the comic. You know,

321
00:31:23,636 --> 00:31:28,338
when the second half of the story starts, he's
still very meek. It wasn't until he really

322
00:31:28,378 --> 00:31:32,420
went out crime fighting for the first time that
he kind of began to get his edge again. But

323
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,342
I feel like he was flirting with Laurie even
before he put on the costume in this adaptation.

324
00:31:37,742 --> 00:31:41,764
For sure. Yeah, he got his groove back a little
bit earlier than in the books. Yeah. One of

325
00:31:41,784 --> 00:31:46,786
my favorite things about the character of Night
Owl in the comic was his gadgets. He's a gadgeteer

326
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:51,228
inspired by the character of Blue Beetle. And
there were a lot of them that were missing

327
00:31:51,588 --> 00:31:56,551
from this adaptation, unfortunately. I think
he had some cool ones. He had those crescent

328
00:31:56,591 --> 00:31:59,512
darts. I call them that because that's what
Moon Knight calls them. But they were like

329
00:31:59,532 --> 00:32:04,315
in the shape of crescent moons. But they were
like taser disks, right? They had like an electrical

330
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:10,538
current running between the tips. But did he
have a hot cocoa dispenser in Archie? Like

331
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:16,902
he did in the comics? No, but he had jazz music.
Yeah. Let's move on to Laurie Yuspechik, aka

332
00:32:16,942 --> 00:32:22,185
Silk Spectre II. You know, after walking away
from Dr. Manhattan's, Laurie begins carving

333
00:32:22,265 --> 00:32:28,233
out an identity. on her own terms. Joining Dan,
she finds someone she can truly relate to,

334
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:33,577
free from the weight of her mother's expectations
or the stifling life at Dr. Manhattan's side.

335
00:32:33,978 --> 00:32:38,921
Fighting crime with Dan renews the sense of
purpose within her, letting her step out of

336
00:32:38,941 --> 00:32:44,386
the shadow of her mother and enter her own spotlight.
During her time on Mars, Laurie comes to the

337
00:32:44,426 --> 00:32:50,578
revelation that the comedian, the man who tried
to rape her mother, is her father. and it affects

338
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:56,281
everything she thought she knew about not only
her upbringing, but also love and ultimately

339
00:32:56,341 --> 00:33:03,065
forgiveness. When Adrian's plan is revealed,
it helps her adapt and accept the same compromises

340
00:33:03,165 --> 00:33:09,148
that would allow her to reconcile with her mother
and grow further into her being her own hero.

341
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:14,752
Laurie's Ark is always a good one, especially
in Chapter 2, but I will say that I think that

342
00:33:14,772 --> 00:33:21,732
this film handled the revelation on Mars. more
clumsily than I would have liked. There's just

343
00:33:21,752 --> 00:33:26,236
some weird dialogue surrounding it when like
Dr. Manhattan's like, look at this chaotic

344
00:33:26,276 --> 00:33:32,642
terrain. And she was like, we have chaotic terrain,
look at the chaoticness of my family. I'm like,

345
00:33:32,702 --> 00:33:38,346
that was kind of a stretch. I think that was
from the comic. Well, that's just bad writing.

346
00:33:38,887 --> 00:33:43,771
I don't think it's a terrible line. The whole
exchange was done so much better in the comic

347
00:33:43,811 --> 00:33:48,987
because there was just a lot more to the conversation.
So it didn't feel forced and it didn't feel

348
00:33:49,087 --> 00:33:53,869
rushed. It felt very natural. I actually really
liked that issue from the comic. I thought

349
00:33:53,889 --> 00:33:59,032
the live action version handled it believably
and just better all around. The live action

350
00:33:59,072 --> 00:34:04,215
version was better and the comic is even better
than that. The way the comic plays with time

351
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:10,219
is done in a way that I feel like you can't
really translate as well to film just because

352
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:15,261
of the nature of the different panels and the
way you shift from scene to scene in a comic.

353
00:34:15,646 --> 00:34:20,568
In the comic book, it doesn't necessarily feel
like flashbacks. No, it feels literally like

354
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:25,571
the events are taking place concurrently in
the same way that Dr. Manhattan perceives time.

355
00:34:26,032 --> 00:34:31,855
Right. It's not as forced in a comic book as
it is on screen. Exactly. Because like you

356
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:36,237
have to treat a flashback as like a memory.
So you kind of see Laurie kind of almost have

357
00:34:36,257 --> 00:34:41,601
to zone out kind of to think about this thing
that happened to her previously in her life.

358
00:34:41,881 --> 00:34:45,062
With the comic book, you don't have to do that.
I almost feel like if they ever want to do

359
00:34:45,102 --> 00:34:51,846
this scene justice, like if they ever did a
12 episode miniseries on television, they would

360
00:34:51,906 --> 00:34:58,050
need two frames on screen at the same time,
kind of playing concurrently with each other.

361
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:03,933
That would be really hard to do, though. Split
screen stuff. It could be done. Is pretty clumsy.

362
00:35:03,953 --> 00:35:08,696
Just look at the Captain America trailer. They
did it fine there. Yeah. OK. Yeah, sure. I'd

363
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:13,718
at least like to see it attempted before I judge
it. Yeah. Let's go ahead and move on to Dr.

364
00:35:13,758 --> 00:35:19,900
Manhattan, aka Jonathan Osterman. After retreating
to Mars, Dr. Manhattan finds himself increasingly

365
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,401
removed from the human condition he once knew.
Observing Earth from a distance, he contemplates

366
00:35:25,481 --> 00:35:30,643
time, probability, and the very structure of
existence, growing more indifferent by the

367
00:35:30,703 --> 00:35:36,364
moment. But when Lori appears, bringing with
her the messy complexities of love, trauma,

368
00:35:36,424 --> 00:35:42,811
and hope, he's forced to reconsider humanity's
worth. The simple, unlikely miracle of Laurie's

369
00:35:42,951 --> 00:35:49,194
own life rekindles a faint spark of empathy
he thought was gone. After returning to Earth

370
00:35:49,555 --> 00:35:55,818
and witnessing Adrian's atrocity, Dr. Manhattan
agrees to keep the peace through silence, yet

371
00:35:55,858 --> 00:36:00,941
in doing so he chooses to leave Earth behind,
forging a new path where he can create life

372
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:03,282
and shape his own meaning in the cosmos.

373
00:36:09,826 --> 00:36:15,749
the existence of life, a highly overrated phenomenon,
and then almost immediately after that calls

374
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:22,153
all life a miracle. Well, he just came to that
realization. His mind was changed. A being

375
00:36:22,253 --> 00:36:27,396
even as omnipotent as him can still be reasoned
with. To me, he just seems like a man who can't

376
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:34,140
stand by his convictions. That's what I say.
Well, lucky enough, he didn't. I always thought

377
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:38,807
that it was a convenient bit of writing. on
behalf of Alan Moore and the original Watchmen

378
00:36:38,827 --> 00:36:44,630
story in that, you know, if Laurie is such a
miracle, he's like, oh yeah, all life is a

379
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:49,773
miracle. By its very nature, then you'd have
to redefine the term miracle, I think. Well,

380
00:36:49,793 --> 00:36:56,597
she helped him realize that the rarity of life
itself in the cosmos is a miracle and that

381
00:36:56,637 --> 00:37:02,100
by its very nature, each human life is its own
miracle, which it is because, you know, all

382
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,754
of us were at one point, you know, different,
competing. sperm and ova fighting for a chance

383
00:37:07,834 --> 00:37:12,976
to become what we are now. I just feel like
that's a little bit ridiculous because sure,

384
00:37:13,296 --> 00:37:21,138
the odds of the sperm connecting with that specific
egg from your mom statistically is highly unlikely,

385
00:37:21,638 --> 00:37:26,739
but again it happens all the fucking time. So
on earth, again, I think you have to redefine

386
00:37:26,759 --> 00:37:31,821
your definition of miracle because it's not
that special. Cynical asshole says what?

387
00:37:35,278 --> 00:37:39,539
Appreciate your own life. What does that have
to do with anything that we were talking about?

388
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:44,301
I'm saying you're a miracle, bro. I'm saying
you have to perceive life as a miracle in order

389
00:37:44,341 --> 00:37:50,183
to appreciate it. I'm just saying you have to
redefine miracle if it happens repeatedly over

390
00:37:50,203 --> 00:37:54,764
and over and even sometimes by accident. Whoa,
gotta put a rubber on it, man. Gotta put a

391
00:37:54,784 --> 00:38:00,599
rubber on it. Well, how would you redefine it
then? I would define it as highly probable,

392
00:38:00,819 --> 00:38:06,002
even though the fact that the comedian and Sally
Jupiter didn't get along at first, you know,

393
00:38:06,022 --> 00:38:12,225
later on they did. And they boned each other
and they had a baby. As these things happen.

394
00:38:12,605 --> 00:38:17,908
So I'm not like freaking claiming it's the same
thing as air turning into gold, like Dr. Manhattan

395
00:38:17,948 --> 00:38:23,071
is. And yet the rest of the universe may say
differently. They'd be like, holy shit, there's

396
00:38:23,091 --> 00:38:29,975
a planet with life on it. What? Says the planet
that also has life on it. Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

397
00:38:30,635 --> 00:38:35,898
All right. I may be coming across as overly
cynical and I'm not really a cynic, but I'm

398
00:38:35,958 --> 00:38:43,062
not nearly as wishy washy as Dr. Manhattan either.
I don't think you appreciate being alive enough,

399
00:38:43,222 --> 00:38:48,565
Joseph. Really? Yes. I guess what I'm saying
is you need like an existential breakdown.

400
00:38:49,025 --> 00:38:55,809
Okay. I'm pretty busy at work, so it might happen.
We're going to get to Ozymandias aka Adrian

401
00:38:55,889 --> 00:39:01,012
Veit. Adrian doesn't have too much screen time.
In Chapter 2, he spends most of that revealing

402
00:39:01,373 --> 00:39:07,977
the full extent of his grand, terrifying vision.
He was an admirer of Alexander the Great. And

403
00:39:08,097 --> 00:39:14,041
Adrian's master plan is his way of slicing through
the Gordian knot that was the Cold War tensions,

404
00:39:14,422 --> 00:39:20,686
a problem too tangled and complex for any rational
negotiation. Rather than seeking a delicate

405
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:27,646
solution, he opted to manufacture a common enemy
to rally humanity. By sacrificing millions

406
00:39:27,686 --> 00:39:33,549
of innocent lives, he took the utilitarian approach
that the ends justify the means. Yet after

407
00:39:33,589 --> 00:39:40,412
the dust settles and the surviving heroes reluctantly
agree to silence, he looks to them for validation,

408
00:39:40,772 --> 00:39:46,955
an assurance that he truly did the right thing.
His triumph feels hollow, and despite all his

409
00:39:47,055 --> 00:39:53,546
brilliance, he remains uncertain whether he
succeeded in preserving life's value. or simply

410
00:39:53,626 --> 00:40:00,127
proved that humanity can be manipulated into
salvation for however long that lasts. Here's

411
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:06,269
another issue I have with the story of Watchmen.
Okay! And Ozymandias' plan. And another reason

412
00:40:06,289 --> 00:40:13,451
why I like the 2009 live-action adaptation better
because in that film, they showed that Ozymandias

413
00:40:13,591 --> 00:40:18,913
not only attacked New York, but a lot of major
cities across the globe. True. Which I think

414
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:25,072
was important to humanity coming together. against
a common enemy. Let me draw a metaphor for

415
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:30,658
you, okay? Say you're about to get in a fist
fight with your sworn enemy, okay? And right

416
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:35,762
before you two are about to throw punches, your
enemy gets hit by a bike or something like

417
00:40:35,802 --> 00:40:41,387
that, okay? Are you two all of a sudden gonna
join forces together against the bicyclist

418
00:40:41,788 --> 00:40:46,632
or are you gonna be like, thank god it was that
guy and not me, that guy hit by the bike? I'm

419
00:40:46,692 --> 00:40:52,020
not necessarily convinced that New York specifically
getting attacked, and only New York getting

420
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:58,244
attacked, would draw the entire globe together
in world peace, considering that, you know,

421
00:40:58,424 --> 00:41:04,209
America was about to be part of the end of the
world, you know? I'm not sure that New York

422
00:41:04,249 --> 00:41:08,171
would draw that much sympathy from America's
enemies at that time. Well, if I thought that

423
00:41:08,211 --> 00:41:13,855
the bicyclist was also going to come after me,
right after he attacked you, then yeah, I'd

424
00:41:13,895 --> 00:41:18,194
probably join forces with you to fend off the
bicyclist. I don't know if you caught that

425
00:41:18,214 --> 00:41:24,457
I consider you my mortal enemy. I was like,
wait, what? Why is it me that got hit by the

426
00:41:24,537 --> 00:41:31,021
bike? I guess you're right in that regard. But
yeah, I can totally see why the live action

427
00:41:31,061 --> 00:41:35,864
adaptation had multiple attacks across the globe.
Yeah, I would agree with you, actually. That

428
00:41:35,944 --> 00:41:41,867
is one of the things that the film version did
better than the book version. It was that and

429
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:47,928
also Rorschach going to Dr. Manhattan to see
if he. could see into the future to find out

430
00:41:48,428 --> 00:41:53,656
who the masked killer was. Those are two kind
of gaps that are in the book that the movie

431
00:41:53,956 --> 00:41:57,341
covered well, I thought. Let's move on to the
story highlights.

432
00:42:03,874 --> 00:42:09,276
In a world where fantasies collide and heroes
clash, one podcast network rises above the

433
00:42:09,336 --> 00:42:15,839
rest. Prepare yourself for the ultimate showdowns
in comic books, video games, movies, and anime.

debate and settle the score.

440
00:42:52,082 --> 00:42:57,826
On a remote island, horror comic writer Max
Shea and surrealist painter Hira Manish reflect

441
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:03,289
on how they, along with a group of scientists,
contributed to creating a nightmarish creature

442
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:09,572
for unclear reasons and for an unnamed benefactor,
currently being shipped off the island. Over

443
00:43:09,612 --> 00:43:14,475
the course of the film, interwoven within the
narrative, one of Max Shea's comics,

444
00:43:19,558 --> 00:43:24,419
after his ship was destroyed by the dreaded
Phantom Pirate ship known as the Black Freighter.

445
00:43:24,879 --> 00:43:31,201
Forced to build a raft from corpses of his shipmates,
the traumatized sailor grows mad as he battles

446
00:43:31,241 --> 00:43:36,862
sharks and the sea itself to get home to Davidstown
and protect his family from the oncoming Black

447
00:43:36,902 --> 00:43:42,284
Freighter pirates, only to mistake his wife
for a pirate while attempting to rescue her.

448
00:43:42,724 --> 00:43:47,962
The sailor is then chased by a mob to the sea,
where the Black Freighter waits for him. Now

449
00:43:47,982 --> 00:43:52,343
this of course isn't all in the first scene,
it's interspersed throughout the film, but

450
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:56,705
I wanted to get the Black Friday narrative out
of the way. Yeah, I think I said my piece on

451
00:43:56,745 --> 00:44:04,909
it. Again, fight me. With my fists! Now captured
and imprisoned, Walter Kovacs, aka the vigilante

452
00:44:04,989 --> 00:44:10,611
Rorschach, overcomes a prison attack by inmates
he helped put there. During a psychological

453
00:44:10,671 --> 00:44:15,953
evaluation, Rorschach reveals his traumatic
childhood, and how he was driven to murderous

454
00:44:16,013 --> 00:44:22,008
vigilantism, after confronting a man who fed
a young girl he kidnapped to his dogs. Meanwhile,

455
00:44:22,088 --> 00:44:27,330
Dan Dreiberg rescues Laurie Yuspechik from a
fire in his basement that Laurie accidentally

456
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:32,772
caused while inspecting his high-tech hovercraft,
Archie. While talking about their inspirations

457
00:44:32,812 --> 00:44:38,334
for becoming costumed vigilantes, Dan admits
the comedian's death, Rorschach's imprisonment,

458
00:44:38,775 --> 00:44:44,577
Dr. Manhattan's exile to Mars, and the attempted
assassination of Adrian Veidt are too coincidental

459
00:44:44,617 --> 00:44:49,624
to be unrelated. While watching television,
Dan and Laurie eventually kiss, and though

460
00:44:49,644 --> 00:44:54,447
they attempt to make love, Dan finds himself
impotent from the nightmare-inducing stress

461
00:44:54,808 --> 00:44:59,611
of impending nuclear war. One of the things
they did in this movie that was taken straight

462
00:44:59,631 --> 00:45:04,534
from the comic that I thought they did better
than the live-action version was Rorschach

463
00:45:04,614 --> 00:45:10,058
tying the guy who killed the young girl to his
boiler and giving him a saw to cut off his

464
00:45:10,118 --> 00:45:15,730
own hand as he set fire to his house. The movie
was way more violent. But I actually think

465
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:22,171
it's a little bit more jigsaw-esque, like from
the movie Saw, to make him try to cut off his

466
00:45:22,211 --> 00:45:27,493
own hand to save himself, knowing that he ultimately
would not be able to do that. I think the shock

467
00:45:27,573 --> 00:45:32,394
of the violent moment within the live action
movie was more effective in portraying that

468
00:45:32,434 --> 00:45:37,936
transition from Walter Kovacs into Rorschach,
because like he couldn't even speak. All he

469
00:45:37,956 --> 00:45:43,137
did was jam the meat cleaver in the guy's head
saying, men get arrested, dogs get put down.

470
00:45:43,557 --> 00:45:49,389
You know, I thought that was in... extremely
graphic but also effective look at his transitioning

471
00:45:49,429 --> 00:45:55,533
psyche. Here it was just kind of like, eh, you
know, saw your way out if you can. If you can't

472
00:45:55,634 --> 00:45:59,517
then, you know, guess you're gonna die. Well
the whole transition moment was supposed to

473
00:45:59,557 --> 00:46:05,141
be as he's watching the building burn down.
It was sort of this cathartic moment in which

474
00:46:05,201 --> 00:46:11,766
he like arose from the ashes as Rorschach. Sure,
I'll still say less effective. Maybe. While

475
00:46:11,806 --> 00:46:16,548
a mobster named Big Figure attempts to intimidate
Rorschach in his jail cell as a prison riot

476
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:21,371
bruise, Dan and Lori decide to put their old
crime fighting costumes on and take Archie

477
00:46:21,471 --> 00:46:26,855
out for a spin, during which time they rescue
tenants of an apartment fire. Feeling empowered,

478
00:46:27,135 --> 00:46:31,117
Dan and Lori make love aboard Archie before
deciding they should break Rorschach out of

479
00:46:31,177 --> 00:46:36,840
prison. While planning the breakout in Dan's
basement, Dan is visited by his mentor, Hollis

480
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:41,876
Mason, the original Night Owl, who warns Dan
that if he could figure out which crimefighters

481
00:46:41,936 --> 00:46:47,261
rescued the apartment fire tenants, which was
an illegal crimefighting act, the police could

482
00:46:47,321 --> 00:46:52,265
too. After sharing his theory with Hollis regarding
the corporate connections between all of the

483
00:46:52,305 --> 00:46:58,190
recent murders, Dan leaves with Laurie and Archie
just before the police raid his house. While

484
00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:03,234
Dan and Laurie fend off police and rioters,
Rorschach defends himself against a big figure,

485
00:47:03,534 --> 00:47:08,966
killing his men and him before escaping with
his allies. Now the scene with Hollis Mason

486
00:47:09,166 --> 00:47:16,089
visiting Dan is not in the comics. Dan is actually
visited by a detective in that scene. But I

487
00:47:16,149 --> 00:47:22,152
actually liked this more because it gave one
more scene between Hollis and Dan before Hollis

488
00:47:22,192 --> 00:47:26,974
dies. Yeah, that was nice. It kind of gave viewers
that are familiar with the story a little bit

489
00:47:27,014 --> 00:47:31,916
of closure in regards to that relationship,
you know? Right. In the movie, it did seem

490
00:47:31,956 --> 00:47:38,603
like it was just a means for a big exposition
dump. Yes. Yeah. What the story actually was.

491
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:44,866
One thing I didn't like here was how Dan does
give the exposition dump in regards to all

492
00:47:44,886 --> 00:47:50,249
of this research that he seemingly did off screen
about all the different corporations that are

493
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:55,051
tied to the different deaths throughout the
film. Yeah, he was much more informed here

494
00:47:55,071 --> 00:47:59,853
than he ever was in the comics. And we never
really got to see all that information come

495
00:47:59,893 --> 00:48:04,932
together. Regarding the rescue scene of the
tenants from the building fire, that was another

496
00:48:04,952 --> 00:48:09,835
bit of bad dialogue, I thought, when one of
the ladies was like, mother of the deus. And

497
00:48:10,975 --> 00:48:16,699
then Silk Spectre was like, different Spectre
and I'm nobody's mother. Yeah, that was a Trisinski

498
00:48:16,779 --> 00:48:21,021
original there, I believe. And regarding the
sex scene that happened right after, if nothing

499
00:48:21,121 --> 00:48:27,745
else, it just proved how unnecessarily pornographic
Zack Snyder made that scene in his film. Okay,

500
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:36,446
virgin. Damn it! Sorry it makes you so uncomfortable.
It's just gratuitous. I don't know. I don't

501
00:48:36,486 --> 00:48:41,470
disagree. I don't disagree. I thought this was
done very tastefully actually in this animated

502
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:46,694
version. Yeah. In retaliation for Rorschach's
escape, a violent gang of not-tops mistake

503
00:48:46,714 --> 00:48:52,038
Hollis for Dan and beat him to death. During
their escape from police, Dr. Manhattan appears

504
00:48:52,098 --> 00:48:57,121
aboard Archie and takes Laurie with him back
to Mars, where Laurie reminisces through her

505
00:48:57,161 --> 00:49:03,376
life in an attempt to view it from Dr. Manhattan's
extradimensional perception of time, accidentally

506
00:49:03,416 --> 00:49:09,319
revealing in the process that she's sleeping
with Dan. Upset by the revelation, Dr. Manhattan

507
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:15,301
refuses to help save Earth from impending nuclear
war until Laurie comes to the revelation that

508
00:49:15,341 --> 00:49:21,824
the Comedian was her father. Astonished by the
near-miraculous unlikelihood of the union between

509
00:49:21,864 --> 00:49:26,763
Laurie's parents and of Laurie's existence in
general, Dr. Manhattan decides to take her

510
00:49:26,803 --> 00:49:32,767
back to Earth and help. Meanwhile, Dan and Rorschach
visit Adrian's office, hoping he can help them

511
00:49:32,807 --> 00:49:38,452
figure out the connection between the corporations
involved with the recent deaths, only to discover

512
00:49:38,512 --> 00:49:44,996
that Adrian is away at his Antarctic base, Carnac,
and that he owns all of the corporations involved.

513
00:49:45,437 --> 00:49:50,380
On their way to Antarctica, Rorschach mails
his journal to the conspiratorial magazine,

514
00:49:50,681 --> 00:49:56,853
The New Frontiersman. I do like the way this
movie handled Dryberg's revelation that Ozymandias

515
00:49:56,893 --> 00:50:03,259
was behind everything more than the book's method
of having Ozymandias have a really obvious

516
00:50:03,339 --> 00:50:08,583
password on his computer. Like he's the world's
smartest man and yet his password was Ramesses

517
00:50:08,603 --> 00:50:15,509
II, right? Wait, that's an obvious password?
Yes. Oh shit, I need to change mine. Here there

518
00:50:15,529 --> 00:50:19,372
was like no hacking of anything, you know, it
was just good old-fashioned detective work

519
00:50:19,752 --> 00:50:25,024
looking through financial records. Maybe, I
guess you could also say that those records

520
00:50:25,124 --> 00:50:30,429
should have probably been in a vault or a safe
of some sort. And not just like in a drawer

521
00:50:30,449 --> 00:50:35,253
that could be easily opened. I guess that's
fair. When Adrian arrives at Carnac, his assistants

522
00:50:35,313 --> 00:50:39,696
reveal that the shipment from the island has
arrived and that everything for his plan is

523
00:50:39,736 --> 00:50:45,381
in order. Adrian thanks them with wine that
poisons and kills them, while listening to

524
00:50:45,421 --> 00:50:50,365
an interview that he had done with a reporter
that details his life's inspiration for unifying

525
00:50:50,405 --> 00:50:56,293
the world. As Dan and Rorschach approach Antarctica,
we see the ship blow up that was carrying Max

526
00:50:56,313 --> 00:51:02,417
Shea, Hera Manish, and everyone else who built
the unseen creature, now at Karnak, who Adrian

527
00:51:02,457 --> 00:51:08,141
teleports away. Dan and Rorschach attempt to
ambush Adrian, but he counters and disables

528
00:51:08,161 --> 00:51:13,365
them, before revealing that he was the mask
killer, having killed the comedian for learning

529
00:51:13,445 --> 00:51:18,889
of his plan, along with others to get rid of
Dr. Manhattan to prevent him from stopping

530
00:51:18,929 --> 00:51:25,017
his plan. which was to force the world governments
into an era of cooperation and peace, while

531
00:51:25,077 --> 00:51:30,780
seemingly under the threat of an alien attack,
which Adrian achieved prior to Dan and Rorschach's

532
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:36,543
arrival by teleporting a genetically modified
giant squid monster to New York City and causing

533
00:51:36,603 --> 00:51:43,235
it to blow up half its population. Do you ever
feel like... the squid monster was a little

534
00:51:43,275 --> 00:51:48,477
bit far-fetched in the realm of science fiction
for the very grounded world that the Watchmen

535
00:51:48,517 --> 00:51:56,401
story is set in, or relatively grounded world.
I think without Bubastis it was. But with Bubastis

536
00:51:56,541 --> 00:52:02,364
we understand that Ozymandias has been researching
genetic modification for years. Bubastis of

537
00:52:02,384 --> 00:52:08,434
course is Adrian's pet Lynx, genetically modified
Lynx. You know, we know Adrian put a lot of

538
00:52:08,474 --> 00:52:13,958
resources into a lot of different sci-fi-esque
technologies to try to pull off this massive

539
00:52:13,998 --> 00:52:19,421
hoax, including genetic engineering, including
teleportation. Do you think that there is a

540
00:52:19,521 --> 00:52:26,485
more plausible way to fake an alien attack?
When we know that in history, sometimes faking

541
00:52:26,525 --> 00:52:31,809
an alien attack can be as simple as Orson Wells
reading a radio broadcast. Of course, I'm describing,

542
00:52:31,949 --> 00:52:36,504
you know, War of the Worlds. Do you think that
there was probably a better way for Alan Moore

543
00:52:36,584 --> 00:52:43,469
to more convincingly have Adrian depict an alien
attack than through all this sci-fi technology

544
00:52:43,509 --> 00:52:49,554
stuff? Well, how else would you kill two million
people? Well, probably a bomb? I think a more

545
00:52:49,594 --> 00:52:55,879
plausible approach would be like the Independence
Day route where Adrian just develops this UFO

546
00:52:55,919 --> 00:53:00,586
hovercraft that drops a big bomb or something
like that. I think that's... still believable.

547
00:53:00,686 --> 00:53:06,629
Developing an aircraft that's unidentifiable
by the world's military is more simple than

548
00:53:06,849 --> 00:53:12,172
genetically engineering this whole entire new
creature. Yeah, probably. But I also think

549
00:53:12,232 --> 00:53:19,096
that, who knows? I think that if something like
a giant squid monster suddenly appeared on

550
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:24,239
the planet, I'd have an easier time believing
it came from outer space. Then if you just

551
00:53:24,399 --> 00:53:31,371
had a craft drop some kind of explosive and
then like vanish. then, you know, that's nothing.

552
00:53:32,452 --> 00:53:36,435
I guess there would be some deniability there.
Yeah, if Adrian went the ship route, he'd have

553
00:53:36,455 --> 00:53:41,979
to have like the ship crash and it would have
to be of like such advanced technology that

554
00:53:42,099 --> 00:53:46,883
no one would have ever suspected that he was
the one who created it. Still seems a little

555
00:53:46,903 --> 00:53:54,629
bit more plausible than a fucking squid beak
tentacle beast monster. Hey, man, don't hate

556
00:53:54,669 --> 00:53:59,207
the player, hate the game. Well, I will say
I don't hold Alan Moore nearly as high regard

557
00:53:59,247 --> 00:54:04,491
as you do. How does that mean? It means you
put him on a pedestal is what I'm saying. They

558
00:54:04,511 --> 00:54:10,754
have a better writer than Alan Moore. Jonathan
Hickman. No. Wrong. OK.

559
00:54:14,657 --> 00:54:19,940
Dr. Manhattan and Laurie arrive amidst the carnage
in New York. Too late to do anything due to

560
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:26,159
the tachyon radiation from the explosion. Dr.
Manhattan traces the teleportation energy signature

561
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:33,001
to Karnak, where he, Laurie, Dan, and Rorschach
hunt down Adrian for what he did. Though Adrian

562
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:39,263
seemingly kills Dr. Manhattan in an intrinsic
field subtractor, Dr. Manhattan rebuilds himself.

563
00:54:39,563 --> 00:54:44,684
Confronted by the other four, Adrian reveals
via television that his plan was a success

564
00:54:45,104 --> 00:54:49,850
and that world leaders are calling for peace
amidst the tragedy. Each of them accept the

565
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:56,115
reality that Adrian's plan worked and agreed
to secrecy except for Rorschach, whom Dr. Manhattan

566
00:54:56,155 --> 00:55:01,999
kills before informing Adrian that he's leaving
for a less complicated galaxy to create new

567
00:55:02,059 --> 00:55:05,982
life. I can't remember, in the comic book, did
he say that he was leaving for a new galaxy

568
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:11,866
or was he leaving for a new world? Because in
the Watchmen HBO sequel, we saw that he went

569
00:55:11,906 --> 00:55:17,234
to one of the moons of Jupiter, I believe, Europa,
if I'm remembering that correctly. which is

570
00:55:17,274 --> 00:55:22,136
not in another galaxy. And I'm wondering which
adaptation got it incorrect. In the comic,

571
00:55:22,176 --> 00:55:27,940
he said he was leaving the galaxy. Okay, so
the HBO series got it wrong then. Uh, yeah,

572
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:33,623
yeah it did. What are you trying to say? That
it's not good now? Why are you so defensive,

573
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:38,746
Jonathan? I just don't think you like the fact
that I keep attacking what you keep referring

574
00:55:38,786 --> 00:55:45,669
to as the seminal work of the comic book medium.
Uh, yeah, because it is. And you can't accept

575
00:55:45,689 --> 00:55:51,817
that. you think you're too good for it. No DC
work is ever going to be called seminal. Not

576
00:55:51,877 --> 00:55:58,942
while I'm still alive. That could be arranged.
Laurie and Dan, now disguised as Sam and Sandra

577
00:55:58,982 --> 00:56:04,825
Hollis, visit Laurie's mother Sally in a California
rest home, where Laurie reveals she knows the

578
00:56:04,865 --> 00:56:10,489
comedian was her father. Upon leaving, Laurie
and Dan share renewed excitement for costumed

579
00:56:10,569 --> 00:56:15,499
adventuring. In the final scene, employees of
the new frontiersmen are forced to find a new

580
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:20,521
story to run in their magazine now that the
government no longer allows the press to criticize

581
00:56:20,541 --> 00:56:25,583
their former enemies. A junior staffer is asked
to look through a pile of public letters for

582
00:56:25,603 --> 00:56:31,306
a story lead as his hand hovers above Rorschach's
journal. That's the end of the film. I always

583
00:56:31,366 --> 00:56:36,328
liked that ending a lot, and I really like how
the HBO series ran with that too, where it

584
00:56:36,348 --> 00:56:42,530
kind of became like this conspiracy among the
militia group. in that series. Even with like

585
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:47,553
the squid babies, you know, that kept the world
on its toes. That was interesting. What did

586
00:56:47,573 --> 00:56:52,435
you think of the Sam and Sandra Hollis disguise?
Because the live action movie didn't run with

587
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:56,117
that. I don't see why not. I thought it was
a good ending for Dan and Laurie and I like

588
00:56:56,137 --> 00:57:01,179
the way they, you know, paid homage to Hollis
and everything like that. In the end, the book

589
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:07,214
is definitely the best way to experience the
story. And while chapter two was better. than

590
00:57:07,254 --> 00:57:12,757
chapter one. You know, it's still this abridged
animated adaptation that, yeah, may benefit

591
00:57:12,797 --> 00:57:18,261
from increased action in the source material's
latter half, but ultimately it fails to capture

592
00:57:18,561 --> 00:57:24,265
the impact of the book, largely because the
background threat of nuclear war plays second

593
00:57:24,305 --> 00:57:30,990
fiddle to the character drama. Now I'm giving
chapter two three and a half out of five stars

594
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:39,671
a fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. That said
I'm actually not recommending this because

595
00:57:39,731 --> 00:57:44,514
it's the second half of a story starting with
Chapter 1, which I don't recommend. And I don't

596
00:57:44,554 --> 00:57:49,057
recommend this animated adaptation overall.
So you're giving it a fresh rating, but you're

597
00:57:49,077 --> 00:57:55,080
saying you don't recommend it? Yes. Because
of Chapter 1's inferiority? Yes, actually.

598
00:57:55,100 --> 00:58:01,023
Okay, yeah, I think that makes sense. You wouldn't
want people to see Chapter 2 on its own, right?

599
00:58:01,083 --> 00:58:06,038
They coexist with each other, Chapter 1 and
Chapter 2. Right. I agree chapter 2 is better

600
00:58:06,058 --> 00:58:11,262
than chapter 1, but if chapter 1 was a bigger
letdown then I recommend the films as a whole.

601
00:58:11,722 --> 00:58:18,327
I'm really hoping that by me doing this it's
not going to give chapter 2 a 100% tomato meter

602
00:58:18,387 --> 00:58:21,849
score because I don't think it deserves it.
I don't think this film really should have

603
00:58:21,949 --> 00:58:27,273
ever been made. But I don't think it also deserves
to be shit on. The film exists in this weird

604
00:58:27,313 --> 00:58:34,510
limbo of irrelevancy. Neither good nor bad,
just redundant. Here's what I will say. who

605
00:58:34,570 --> 00:58:41,316
made chapters 1 and 2 liked the source material
enough to take a crack at this. I think their

606
00:58:41,356 --> 00:58:46,740
passion shows in how faithful they tried to
make it, but ultimately it was a waste of time.

607
00:58:47,201 --> 00:58:54,167
But you guys have good taste. Most DC things
are a waste of time. Really. So is your face.

608
00:58:54,687 --> 00:58:58,430
But that does it for this review. AG9K, help
close us out.
