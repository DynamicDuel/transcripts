This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:29,335
And welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,355 --> 00:00:34,416
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters and stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:42,298
I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm his twin brother
Johnny DC. And in this episode, guys, we are

5
00:00:42,358 --> 00:00:47,820
reviewing the only DC film that is going to
be released in theaters this year, Joker Folie a Deux.

6
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,801
And was the movie a colossal waste of time?
I'm going to say yes. And I'm going to say...

7
00:00:54,426 --> 00:00:59,327
I hate you, but damn do I respect your opinion.
We're gonna talk all about our opinions on

8
00:00:59,347 --> 00:01:03,168
this film later on this episode. It'll be a
spoiler review, so make sure you've seen the

9
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:06,869
film before you listen to us. Or not. I actually
take that back. Why would you say that? I really

10
00:01:06,889 --> 00:01:11,270
don't care. Before we get into the review, we're
gonna break down the latest comic book movie

11
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,911
news to come out this past week, of which there
was only one news item, and that is that there

12
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:20,833
is a Robin-focused animated film in development
called Dynamic Duo. Totally ripping us off.

13
00:01:20,893 --> 00:01:26,959
We're duel though. D-U-E-L. As always guys,
we list our segment times in our episode description,

26
00:02:29,874 --> 00:02:34,098
which pits your favorite action heroes from
film and television against each other. This

27
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:40,283
week, hosts Scotty and Gilly are breaking down
a Sting vs. Undertaker matchup. On the Senjoworld

28
00:02:40,323 --> 00:02:45,027
podcast, host Zachary Hepburn speculates on
fights between fan favorite anime and manga

29
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:50,931
characters. Last week, he found out who would
win between Gridman and Kaiju 8. We teased

30
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:57,303
the episode incorrectly. Zach will find out
who will win between Muzan from Demon Slayer

31
00:02:57,703 --> 00:03:03,546
and Femto from Berserk. And on the Console Combat
Podcast hosts John and Dean simulate battles

32
00:03:03,566 --> 00:03:08,648
between popular video game characters. In yesterday's
episode, they determined who would win in a

33
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:16,631
fight between Wukong from Black Myth Wukong
and Asura from Asura's Wrath. Visit dynamicpodcasts.com

to the no prize! A no prize is an award Marvel

36
00:03:29,097 --> 00:03:34,800
used to give out to fans. Our version, the dynamic
duel no prize, is a digital award that we post

37
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,522
on Instagram for the person that we feel gave
the best answer to our question of the week.

38
00:03:40,023 --> 00:03:45,726
Last week we asked, what is your theory as to
what the asterisk means in the Thunderbolts

39
00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:49,848
movie title? And we got a few answers. Some
pretty good theories here. Let's go ahead and

40
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:54,343
run down our honorable mentions as well as the
no prize winner. Our first honorable mention

41
00:03:54,403 --> 00:04:00,508
goes to Mike Williams, who said, Hey gang, this
is Mike Williams out of St. Louis, Missouri.

42
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:06,914
The asterisk on Thunderbolts movie probably
means that this is not the real team or they're

43
00:04:06,934 --> 00:04:14,902
going to introduce a team at the end of the
movie. Who knows? So until DC makes a hit movie,

44
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:20,775
make mine Marvel. That is correct. Until DC
makes a good movie, make mine Marvel. Way to

45
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:25,259
go Mike Williams. That's the sentiment we want
from all the callers that call in for sure.

46
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:30,344
Why am I not surprised that he's talking about
movies and not comics? Typical Marvel fan.

47
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:35,508
I think he's right there. So yeah, the primary
theory regarding the asterisk at the end of

48
00:04:35,548 --> 00:04:39,072
the Thunderbolts movie title is that this is
not the real Thunderbolts team. And that could

49
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:43,936
mean either that the team labeled as the Thunderbolts
in this film is actually a different team such

50
00:04:44,096 --> 00:04:48,780
as the champions. Secret Avengers, Dark Avengers,
something like that. Or that they are called

51
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,243
the Thunderbolts, but it's not like an official
team title because they're classified. I think

52
00:04:53,283 --> 00:04:57,226
either of those options would make sense. Yeah,
that second option there is what I actually

53
00:04:57,246 --> 00:05:01,169
think the asterisk means personally. So great
answer, Mike Williams. Let's go ahead and move

54
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:05,932
on to our next honorable mention. Scott Camacho,
who said, Come on, we know what the asterisk

55
00:05:05,992 --> 00:05:10,235
is. They're trying to find another subtitle,
but I'm gonna help them out. It's gonna be

56
00:05:10,295 --> 00:05:17,455
called Thunderbolts Red Alert. Why? because
in the trailer we didn't see Ross. Where is

57
00:05:17,536 --> 00:05:23,659
Ross? I mean, I'm pretty sure the name Thunderbolts
is affiliated with the Red Hulk. So I'm gonna

58
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:28,682
say that it's gonna be a surprise maybe in the
second trailer that we're gonna see the Red

59
00:05:28,702 --> 00:05:33,964
Hulk and it's gonna be Thunderbolts Red Alert.
Now I would actually be surprised if Harrison

60
00:05:34,024 --> 00:05:40,468
Ford made some kind of cameo as a member of
this team. Though I do think that perhaps one

61
00:05:40,488 --> 00:05:45,990
of the reasons the name of the team is classified
is because it's a team that's sanctioned by

62
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:51,452
Thunderbolt Ross in the same way that the Suicide
Squad is sanctioned under Amanda Waller. That's

63
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:57,073
possible. I can understand why a lot of people
think that the Thunderbolts team is somehow

64
00:05:57,113 --> 00:06:01,615
affiliated with President Thunderbolt Ross.
That's actually not the case from the comics.

65
00:06:01,835 --> 00:06:05,916
Thunderbolt Ross had nothing to do with the
original Thunderbolts team led by Baron Zemo.

66
00:06:06,396 --> 00:06:11,877
But I can see how they might go that route in
the MCU as a rationale for the name of the

67
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:16,889
team. It'll be interesting to see how that all
shakes out. If in fact, the Red Hulk will join

68
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:21,033
the team, given that he was once a member of
the Thunderbolts in the comic books. Great

69
00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:27,098
answer, Scott Camacho. Our next honorable mention
goes to Mason Thompson. Who said? What's up?

70
00:06:27,118 --> 00:06:34,745
It's Mason. So this is this is the fact is,
you know, this is just as simple as that. It's

71
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:42,354
a star. Who's a star? Robert Downey Jr. Who
does he play? Dr. Doom. Who's the villain?

72
00:06:42,454 --> 00:06:48,375
Dr. Doom. I hate you 3000. He's gonna be in
the movie! But if I'm being for real, I think

73
00:06:48,415 --> 00:06:53,057
that they were like villains. And then by the
end of the movie, they like changed good. If

74
00:06:53,077 --> 00:06:58,818
that makes sense. RDJ better not be in this
movie. I'm still holding out hope that Marvel

75
00:06:58,838 --> 00:07:04,140
will actually still recast the role of Dr. Doom
as unlikely as that will be. I don't want to

76
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,201
see Robert Downey Jr. in the role for reasons
that we discussed when that news was announced

77
00:07:08,401 --> 00:07:13,096
at Comic-Con. But- The whole conceit of the
Thunderbolts team as they exist in the comic

78
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:18,361
books is that the Thunderbolts are a group of
villains trying to be heroes. So what you're

79
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:22,944
saying is the Thunderbolts asterisk could be
like, oh, it's a super team asterisk, actually

80
00:07:23,004 --> 00:07:28,969
it's villains. Or it's a villains team asterisk,
it's actually heroes. One or the other. That

81
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:34,674
barely makes sense. I'll take it. So great answer
Mason Thompson. We want to give a quick shout

82
00:07:34,694 --> 00:07:39,366
out to Travis Herndon for taking the time to
call in and leave an answer. His answer is

83
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:43,887
actually pretty much almost exactly the same
as the no-prize winner of this week, who is

84
00:07:44,347 --> 00:07:50,009
Jose Marcial. Who said? I have heard a pretty
interesting theory pertaining to the asterisk

85
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:55,910
and the thunderbolt. That at the end of the
movie, somebody, preferably Norman Osborn,

86
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:02,552
hopefully, William DeFoe, is going to come out
and reveal that the whole movie or whatever

87
00:08:02,592 --> 00:08:07,973
was a tryout for them to see what they're capable
of and this is going to be the Dark Avengers.

88
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:13,035
Personally, I really vibe with this theory,
so I hope that is the case. Yeah, I really

89
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,716
like this idea that the Thunderbolts, as they
exist in this movie, is more of just like a

90
00:08:17,816 --> 00:08:24,478
tryout exercise to see who's gonna join the
Dark Avengers set up by Norman Osborn, who

91
00:08:24,558 --> 00:08:29,680
led the team in the comics and in the movies
is played by Willem Dafoe, at least in No Way

92
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,282
Home. But you know, it could be the same actor
for the MCU. I think that'd be fantastic. The

93
00:08:35,322 --> 00:08:40,183
reason this answer got the win over Travis Herndon
is because Travis did say that this is potentially

94
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:45,084
a recruitment team, but the idea of having Norman
Osborn in the movie is really exciting and

95
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:51,046
that was an added element that Jose Marcial
threw in there. I do like the idea of there

96
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:55,787
being some kind of secret benefactor of the
team that's like the major villain. I don't

97
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:59,348
think it's going to be Green Goblin though.
I actually think it's going to be Dr. Doom,

98
00:08:59,468 --> 00:09:06,066
if anybody. Just stop, okay? Leave Dr. Doom's
name out of your mouth. Robert Downey Jr. is

99
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:10,389
not the real Doctor Doom, at least not the one
that real Doctor Doom fans are hoping for.

100
00:09:10,729 --> 00:09:14,992
We want the real Victor Von Doom, so just keep
his name out of your mouth if you know what's

101
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:19,836
good for you. Well, only because Julia Louise
Dryfist seems to be spearheading this whole

102
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:24,419
group. She bought Stark Towers. How did she
afford that? It's gotta be Doctor Doom money.

103
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:29,402
I hope not. I don't want to see that version
of Doctor Doom just yet. It wouldn't make sense

104
00:09:29,462 --> 00:09:33,205
outside of the context of the multiverse. The
Thunderbolts movie, I believe, is not like

105
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:38,186
a multiversal film. Well, it could lead into
Avengers Doomsday. Possibly, I guess so. But

106
00:09:38,226 --> 00:09:42,451
great answer Jose Marcial. Congrats on winning
this week's No Prize. If you the listener want

107
00:09:42,491 --> 00:09:46,376
a shot at winning your own No Prize, stay tuned
to later on this episode when we'll be asking

108
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:50,401
another question of the week. And now that that's
done, on to the news!

109
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:03,352
So last week, Deadline broke the news that a
Robins Origin story titled Dynamic Duo is in

110
00:10:03,372 --> 00:10:08,753
the works with DC Studios and it's going to
be made with puppetry animation. Actually,

111
00:10:08,793 --> 00:10:15,155
it's called specifically Momo animation and
it's a new type of animation that a studio

112
00:10:15,295 --> 00:10:22,997
known as Swaybox has created that combines CGI
with practical effects like stop motion and

113
00:10:23,077 --> 00:10:28,580
live action real-time performances. It's still
in an experimental stage, but they wanna make

114
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:34,024
a full length feature film to be played in theaters.
The movie is being written by Matthew Aldrich,

115
00:10:34,284 --> 00:10:40,068
who also wrote Coco and Lightyear, and it's
gonna be about the early days of Dick Grayson

116
00:10:40,628 --> 00:10:46,452
and Jason Todd as Robin. The film is gonna be
set in James Gunn's DC cinematic universe,

117
00:10:46,472 --> 00:10:52,477
right? We don't know that 100%. I think it's
going to be. All we know for sure is that it's

118
00:10:52,577 --> 00:10:59,501
not going to be a part. of the Matt Reeves Batman
universe. Okay, well, I guess this animated

119
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:05,464
film is a way for fans to see the origins of
these characters that aren't gonna show up

120
00:11:05,504 --> 00:11:09,646
in the Brave and the Bold film. Cause we know
the Brave and the Bold film is set to be a

121
00:11:09,826 --> 00:11:15,049
father, son, Batman and Robin movie where Damien
Wayne is the character of Robin. But that would

122
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:21,032
mean that Dick Grayson and Jason Todd and likely
Tim Drake have already gone through the mantle

123
00:11:21,172 --> 00:11:25,839
in James Gunn's DC universe. So. It's nice that
they're kind of getting their due diligence

124
00:11:25,879 --> 00:11:30,180
within this film. That's all their own. But
it is strange that it's going to be animated.

125
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:36,223
Does that make it seem like it's going to be
a kid's film? It is 100 percent going to be

126
00:11:36,303 --> 00:11:41,705
geared towards families. Actually, one of the
film's producers, Matt Reeves, has pretty much

127
00:11:41,765 --> 00:11:46,867
said that he's excited to do a family film with
this studio. Does that mean that the film's

128
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:51,509
not going to include a savage beatdown of Jason
Todd at the hands of the Joker? Oh, that's

129
00:11:51,529 --> 00:11:56,667
a good question. That would be tragic if it
didn't, but who knows? If they're gearing it

130
00:11:56,687 --> 00:12:01,948
towards families, it may be something that happens
off screen. Who's to say? I've seen some of

131
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:06,709
the test footage that they've been doing with
Swaybox and some of the puppetry. It's not

132
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:12,671
like the Muppets puppetry or anything like that.
This is some high tech quality stuff. Almost

133
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:17,132
in the same vein as Leica Studios, what they
do with their stop motion animation. They made

134
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:21,994
Kubo and the Two Strings and Corpse Bride, Paranorman,
Coraline, stuff like that. What I'm wondering

135
00:12:22,154 --> 00:12:27,078
is who they're gonna cast in these roles, since
James Gunn once stated that the voices that

136
00:12:27,098 --> 00:12:31,522
he casts for animated roles will be playing
the characters in live action. Does that mean

137
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:37,367
that when he casts Dick Grayson and Jason Todd
in this dynamic duo movie, will we eventually

138
00:12:37,427 --> 00:12:42,752
see them in live action in the Brave and the
Bold film? I think as long as like the adult

139
00:12:42,832 --> 00:12:47,355
live action actor can pull off a kid's voice,
you could probably argue that would be the

140
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:51,528
case, but I would be surprised. I guess we'll
find out. Yeah, there's no release date for

141
00:12:51,568 --> 00:12:57,137
this film. It was just announced, but we'll
keep you guys updated as news breaks. But considering

142
00:12:57,197 --> 00:13:01,704
that this film is Robin focused, that brings
us to our question of the week.

143
00:13:06,222 --> 00:13:11,344
Who is your favorite Robin from the comics and
why? There have been a number to choose from

144
00:13:11,605 --> 00:13:15,427
the comics and they all have their own fanbase
so really excited to see what your guys answers

150
00:13:44,878 --> 00:13:48,241
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and get on

151
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:54,267
to our main event, where we review the latest
Warner Bros. DC theatrical release, Joker,

152
00:13:54,467 --> 00:13:55,128
Folie a Deux.

153
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:28,802
Alright, Joker, Folie a Deux, the sequel to
2019's Joker, which up until Deadpool and Wolverine

154
00:14:28,842 --> 00:14:34,406
was the highest grossing rated-R film of all
time and won the Oscars for best actor and

155
00:14:34,446 --> 00:14:40,146
best score, though it was nominated in more
categories including Best Picture, best screenplay

156
00:14:40,206 --> 00:14:45,871
and best director, and it even won the coveted
Golden Lion, the highest honor bestowed at

157
00:14:45,891 --> 00:14:52,017
the Venice Film Festival where it premiered.
The sequel, Folia De, also premiered at the

158
00:14:52,037 --> 00:14:56,901
Venice Film Festival this year to much less
critical acclaim, though I didn't think too

159
00:14:56,941 --> 00:15:02,866
much of it because critics didn't exactly love
the first movie. Many thought it irresponsibly

160
00:15:02,906 --> 00:15:08,194
praised disenfranchised men and would inspire
them to commit violence like the film's lead

161
00:15:08,234 --> 00:15:14,559
character Arthur Fleck, a somewhat valid concern
considering the perpetrator of the 2012 Aurora

162
00:15:14,599 --> 00:15:19,362
Theatre shooting cited the Dark Knight Heath
Ledger version of the character of the Joker

163
00:15:19,582 --> 00:15:26,887
as inspiration. Now, we reviewed 2019's Joker
and gave it 4 stars, though I regret not giving

164
00:15:26,947 --> 00:15:32,791
it a higher rating. At least a 4.5, because
the film was just so unbelievably well

165
00:15:36,678 --> 00:15:41,599
a result of me initially being uncomfortable
with the film. That said, I'd argue now that

166
00:15:41,619 --> 00:15:47,721
the film was intentionally made to be uncomfortable
and therefore succeeded as a work of art. So

167
00:15:47,761 --> 00:15:53,923
it's perhaps strange that while I'd argue the
very same thing for Folly Ado, I'd also argue

168
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:59,584
that this quote unquote work of art, with its
fantastic performances and cinematography,

169
00:16:00,104 --> 00:16:06,687
unfortunately fails to deliver on the promises
it set up. deciding instead to subvert audience

170
00:16:06,727 --> 00:16:14,331
expectations in the most unsatisfying of ways.
It's like the first movie was this disturbing

171
00:16:14,371 --> 00:16:19,575
yet beautiful portrait of the Joker. And for
the second movie, screenwriter and director

172
00:16:19,615 --> 00:16:25,058
Todd Phillips began painting yet another masterpiece.
Only in the final moments of working on the

173
00:16:25,098 --> 00:16:30,361
painting, he decided to shit on it and just
smear it across the canvas, just fucking ruining

174
00:16:30,401 --> 00:16:36,213
everything. almost as if he wanted to play a
joke on the audience. As much as it breaks

175
00:16:36,253 --> 00:16:42,457
my heart, I can't recommend seeing this movie
just because of that ending. If you have seen

176
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:47,220
the movie and want to know my thoughts on it,
please keep listening to this spoiler review.

177
00:16:47,621 --> 00:16:51,723
And if you haven't seen the film and want to
spare yourself of watching it, you can still

178
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:57,407
keep listening too. Yeah, yeah. Now, the premise
of the film is actually pretty good. It's an

179
00:16:57,587 --> 00:17:03,271
experimental portrait of a sympathetic murderer
Arthur Fleck, who learns he's facing the death

180
00:17:03,311 --> 00:17:09,235
penalty for his crimes right after falling for
a manipulative and obsessive fan of his, Harleen

181
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:15,099
Quinzel. I say it's experimental in the way
it subverts audience expectations at the end,

182
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,683
but also in the way music plays a role in the
film. The movie was described by the press

183
00:17:20,723 --> 00:17:26,367
as a musical while it was in production, but
while it does have characters singing in it,

184
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:33,064
to me it felt more like a biopic of a musician.
rather than a quote-unquote musical. Usually

185
00:17:33,104 --> 00:17:38,427
in musicals, the music serves the story in some
way. You often have a song establishing the

186
00:17:38,508 --> 00:17:44,031
setting of the story and the protagonist's goals,
and you'll have a number by the villain that

187
00:17:44,051 --> 00:17:49,495
expresses what they want as well. There's a
whole formula to it that Follyado doesn't adhere

188
00:17:49,535 --> 00:17:55,720
to. Whereas in music biopics, music is often
used simply as entertainment, as a way to liven

189
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:01,007
up the story and visuals of the film. Well,
music biopics are usually about musicians.

190
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:06,292
Exactly. The Joker is not a musician, but I
could see where Todd Phillips would kind of

191
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:11,996
almost see him in that way. I understand why
Todd Phillips would have wanted to focus on

192
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:18,121
music in the sequel. The score of the first
film composed by Hildur Gudnedadder was so

193
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:24,707
damn moving. So expanding upon that with actual
songs, I thought was going to be pretty genius,

194
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:30,562
especially with Lady Gaga cast as Harley Quinn.
If you've listened to the podcast for a while,

195
00:18:30,842 --> 00:18:35,964
you'll know that I've been excited for the idea
of this film as a musical, because not only

196
00:18:36,004 --> 00:18:41,305
was it going to add something new to the comic
book film genre, but also musicals could be

197
00:18:41,405 --> 00:18:48,167
pretty moving and powerful. I'm not one of these
musical haters who refuse to see Folly Ado

198
00:18:48,327 --> 00:18:53,729
just because people sing in it. I'll hear people,
even co-workers, say that, and I'm like, really?

199
00:18:53,969 --> 00:18:57,791
So you don't like Nightmare Before Christmas
or- You know, the South Park movie or Prince

200
00:18:57,831 --> 00:19:02,834
of Egypt, Flight of the Concords. I want you
to look me in the eyes and tell me you can't

201
00:19:02,854 --> 00:19:07,377
sing along to the songs in Aladdin. Well, to
that end, I think this musical would have been

202
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:12,641
more successful as a musical if the songs were
original, building upon Hilda Gunnadadter's

203
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:19,045
talent. Oh, 100%. Yeah. Hilda Gunnadadter's
talent and Lady Gaga's songwriting talent.

204
00:19:19,205 --> 00:19:22,968
If she has any, I don't actually know if she
does. Maybe someone else writes all of her

205
00:19:23,008 --> 00:19:28,296
music. But yeah, when we first learned. that
this was going to be a jukebox musical. I was

206
00:19:28,336 --> 00:19:32,479
pretty disappointed by that when we were talking
about it in our news section. And it turns

207
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:37,283
out that disappointment was just the tip of
a giant iceberg of disappointment I would have

208
00:19:37,323 --> 00:19:41,767
by the end of watching this movie. Now, another
reason I understood the musical direction is

209
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:46,871
because Todd Phillips has explained when talking
about the first movie that music lives in Arthur's

210
00:19:46,971 --> 00:19:53,497
soul, as evidenced in Joaquin Phoenix's graceful,
masterful performance. It was merely glimpsed

211
00:19:53,537 --> 00:19:59,243
in the first film. But in the sequel, Arthur's
internal melody comes to life in the form of

212
00:19:59,363 --> 00:20:04,986
several imagined musical numbers. Though again,
I'm hesitant to call this a musical. As I mentioned,

213
00:20:05,046 --> 00:20:08,727
musicals tend to drive the narrative forward
and provide some insight into a character's

214
00:20:08,767 --> 00:20:13,349
thoughts and feelings. And some of the songs
in this film do indeed provide that function,

215
00:20:13,409 --> 00:20:18,691
but not very well. Partly because the songs
are unoriginal and weren't written for this

216
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:24,013
film. And also because the songs are really
short. Like we just hear snippets here and

217
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:30,631
there. and if they're not being sung by Harley
Quinn as a way to mesmerize and manipulate

218
00:20:30,691 --> 00:20:36,453
Arthur, they take place in Arthur's imagination
as fantasies or ways to cope with what's happening

219
00:20:36,493 --> 00:20:42,295
to him. I didn't mind the way Harley sank to
him because of the whole music therapy thing

220
00:20:42,335 --> 00:20:47,196
that they had going on in this film, but I will
admit the short imagined musical numbers were

221
00:20:47,216 --> 00:20:53,010
kind of pointless to the narrative of the film
and halted its flow. Most of the musical numbers

222
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:58,352
feel like they existed merely to take a break
from the film's courtroom drama, but unnecessarily

223
00:20:58,472 --> 00:21:03,473
so. Like, the courtroom scenes are some of the
most interesting in the movie, I felt, and

224
00:21:03,493 --> 00:21:07,975
that we learn some profound information that
expands upon the tragedy of Arthur from the

225
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:12,857
first film. Yeah, there were some musical scenes
that we saw here that made sense to me in the

226
00:21:12,917 --> 00:21:18,819
context of what was happening in the plot. But
by the time we got to the scene of Joker tap

227
00:21:18,859 --> 00:21:23,862
dancing and stuff like that, I'm like, the film
has lost the plot. Yes, absolutely. And more

228
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:28,625
than that, it made the film seem like it had
no plot. Really, there's not too much story

229
00:21:28,685 --> 00:21:33,387
here. It felt like filler, like they were padding
the runtime, like they just wanted to insert

230
00:21:33,427 --> 00:21:37,570
different musical numbers and various random
places because they have Lady Gaga or some

231
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:43,193
shit. Exactly. Part of the tragedy of Arthur
in this film comes with the realization that

232
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:48,867
Harley is only in love with Joker and what he
represents rather than the pitiful Arthur,

233
00:21:49,247 --> 00:21:55,288
who she selfishly manipulates and tries to bring
more and more of the Joker out of in him. There's

234
00:21:55,308 --> 00:22:00,050
this line that she repeats over the course of
the film, and I took it almost as an explicit

235
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:07,112
promise to the audience that she and the Joker
were going to, quote, build a mountain, unquote.

236
00:22:07,132 --> 00:22:11,633
Now, this was in reference to a song by Sammy
Davis Jr. who played a clown character in the

237
00:22:11,673 --> 00:22:17,283
musical Stop the World I Want to Get Off. He
seems the line that he's going to build a mountain

238
00:22:17,323 --> 00:22:23,485
from a little hill, build a heaven from a little
hell. Now that heaven was going to be the new

239
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:28,708
world the Joker ushered in, a world for the
downtrodden, built from the havoc that Joker

240
00:22:28,728 --> 00:22:34,330
and Harley were seemingly going to wreck upon
the court and the system in glorious retribution

241
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:40,012
for the difficult life Arthur and members of
society have had. But in an almost apologetic

242
00:22:40,112 --> 00:22:47,443
and perhaps socially responsible way, Todd Phillips
dashes any and all hopes for poetic justice

243
00:22:47,763 --> 00:22:53,104
or cathartic bloodlust, deciding instead to
emphasize the tragedy of Arthur Fleck, but

244
00:22:53,124 --> 00:22:57,165
without any kind of beauty whatsoever. Todd
Phillips has said that he thought it would

245
00:22:57,185 --> 00:23:03,167
be interesting if Arthur wasn't the comic book
Joker, but maybe just the inspiration for him.

246
00:23:03,687 --> 00:23:09,129
But then why call your film Joker? Why make
that promise that you can't keep or that joke

247
00:23:09,169 --> 00:23:15,451
for which you have no punchline? For sure. This
pisses me off about Todd Phillips. You said

248
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:20,253
that maybe this film was apologetic. I totally
saw it that way. The vibe that I got walking

249
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:24,595
out of the theater was that Todd Phillips kind
of pussed out at the message that he had set

250
00:23:24,615 --> 00:23:30,577
up in the first film wanting to not perhaps
instigate chaos and anarchy in the world, even

251
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:35,839
though that didn't really happen. Like the first
film, for all the fear that it instigated in

252
00:23:35,959 --> 00:23:40,641
clickbait news media, you know, nothing really
came of it. People just saw it as an interesting

253
00:23:40,701 --> 00:23:45,332
film. But I think the idea of the first film
almost scared Todd Phillips. And it seemed

254
00:23:45,352 --> 00:23:49,894
like he rode himself into a corner or he was
just disavowing the first film. Yeah, it definitely

255
00:23:49,934 --> 00:23:54,457
seems that way. I'm definitely seeing a narrative
emerge around this film that Todd Phillips

256
00:23:54,537 --> 00:23:59,479
must be ashamed of how his Joker has influenced
to the culture and become a symbol for a type

257
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:04,322
of revolution that perhaps is attractive to
the same kind of people that critics were afraid

258
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:09,185
would be inspired by the first film. I'm not
sure that's exactly the case, though I will

259
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:15,205
admit I did get like I said earlier, those apologetic
vibes during the Joker's closing argument.

260
00:24:15,725 --> 00:24:19,708
But on my way home from seeing the movie, I
actually thought of a different possibility

261
00:24:19,748 --> 00:24:25,472
for what went wrong with this film, and that's
studio involvement. Not from the new DC studios,

262
00:24:25,512 --> 00:24:30,475
but from Warner Bros., who's been known to get
too involved with DC's films like Suicide Squad

263
00:24:30,775 --> 00:24:34,798
and Justice League. And to me it makes sense
that the studio would get involved if they

264
00:24:34,838 --> 00:24:40,202
felt one of their major characters was being
mishandled, namely Harley Quinn. a character

265
00:24:40,242 --> 00:24:46,184
that DC head Jim Lee has called the fourth pillar
of DC comics, along with the trinity of Batman,

266
00:24:46,224 --> 00:24:51,987
Superman, and Wonder Woman. Now between 2020's
Birds of Prey film and the Harley Quinn animated

267
00:24:52,047 --> 00:24:57,750
series, Harley Quinn has been established as
an independent feminist icon separate from

268
00:24:57,770 --> 00:25:02,672
the Joker and Thriving. This film couldn't end
with Joker and Harley riding off together into

269
00:25:02,712 --> 00:25:08,130
the sunset, as I suspect many people wanted,
like I wanted. For the sake of Harley, they

270
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:14,112
needed to break the two up, though they managed
to do so in the most anticlimactic way possible.

271
00:25:14,552 --> 00:25:19,333
Now we know from scenes from the trailers, like
Harley with a haircut going down an elevator,

272
00:25:19,733 --> 00:25:24,975
or Harley and Joker high kicking their way down
the steps of a courthouse, as well as set footage

273
00:25:25,235 --> 00:25:30,576
of Harley pushing Arthur down the steps at the
end, that there was probably another cut of

274
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:35,854
this film. And since Warner Brothers has said
this film was never screened, in front of a

275
00:25:35,914 --> 00:25:40,518
test audience prior to its premiere, to me it
makes a lot of sense that it was the studio

276
00:25:40,578 --> 00:25:45,542
itself that made Todd Phillips change his original
vision. I'm not saying that's what happened,

277
00:25:45,902 --> 00:25:50,847
I'm saying it wouldn't surprise me. Yeah, to
that end, maybe we'll be getting a director's

278
00:25:50,867 --> 00:25:55,070
cut of this film considering the poor reception
that the movie is getting both critically and

279
00:25:55,110 --> 00:26:00,675
financially. If a hashtag restore the Phillips
cut starts trending, I would not be surprised.

280
00:26:00,835 --> 00:26:05,483
Because we've praised Todd Phillips on this
podcast before. We've called him an auteur.

281
00:26:06,023 --> 00:26:11,468
If he is entirely to blame for what went wrong
with this film, then I am really confused.

282
00:26:11,908 --> 00:26:19,715
Like experimentation is admirable somewhat,
but not with $200 million, not with fan expectations.

283
00:26:20,035 --> 00:26:24,999
If you're not going to make a comic book movie
for comic book fans, then who are you making

284
00:26:25,059 --> 00:26:29,323
it for? Like was he making it just for Harley
Quinn fans? Like they're not gonna like this

285
00:26:29,363 --> 00:26:34,238
movie. Lady Gaga fans aren't gonna like this
movie. Fans of the first movie aren't going

286
00:26:34,258 --> 00:26:40,062
to like this movie. Why make a movie with actors
of this caliber, with cinematography this beautiful,

287
00:26:40,482 --> 00:26:45,105
that no one is going to like? Well, as we've
said on this podcast before, Todd Phillips

288
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:50,067
wanted to make a movie about mental illness
and knew that the best way to get people to

289
00:26:50,107 --> 00:26:55,450
see it is to attach a comic book character's
name to it. Hence, Joker. Todd Phillips doesn't

290
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:59,573
really care about the comic book universe, which
really makes me question why he also includes

291
00:26:59,633 --> 00:27:05,177
elements like Harvey Dent. getting his two-face,
you know, that was pretty interesting. Or the

292
00:27:05,237 --> 00:27:09,820
new Joker at the very last shot of this film
slicing the Glasgow smile onto his face and

293
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:15,365
everything like that. Those seem like Easter
eggs for the fans, but it's clear that Todd

294
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:19,228
Phillips also doesn't care about the fans. So
he cares about the fans, but he doesn't care

295
00:27:19,248 --> 00:27:24,092
about the fans. Again, I'm confused. I think
it's less about him caring for the fans and

296
00:27:24,132 --> 00:27:29,276
more about he probably has some kind of studio
exec giving him notes on how to include comic

297
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:34,904
book Easter eggs within his that would excite
fans. Oh, yeah, I could see that for sure.

298
00:27:35,464 --> 00:27:41,148
So fucking mind boggling that studios like Sony
and Warner Brothers get this shit wrong because

299
00:27:41,649 --> 00:27:45,851
literally it just seems so easy to give the
fans what they want. I feel like so much commentary

300
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:51,115
is out there by the fans on exactly what they're
looking for, what their hopes are. And studios

301
00:27:51,155 --> 00:27:56,258
really just need to fucking do that and do nothing
else. Studios really just need to fucking give

302
00:27:56,298 --> 00:28:03,560
me a call. I will tell them what they should
do. Yeah, let's move on to our character breakdown.

303
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,624
Now, Arthur Fleck, I'm not going to call him
the Joker because clearly he's not. He was

304
00:28:08,664 --> 00:28:13,228
played by Joaquin Phoenix. I'm not sure I could
say anything about his performance that I didn't

305
00:28:13,288 --> 00:28:17,892
say the first time around. It's perfect. It's
perfection. I've seen some people say that

306
00:28:17,952 --> 00:28:22,676
he seemed lazy in this film, like he was just
phoning it in or cashing a check. I didn't

307
00:28:22,716 --> 00:28:27,580
get that at all. Like, sure, Arthur is pretty
timid at the beginning, but I also noticed

308
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:32,544
that over the course of the film. more and more
of the Joker character was brought back out

309
00:28:32,664 --> 00:28:38,089
in him up until the end when he rejected the
idea of the Joker. No, I mean, well, Arthur

310
00:28:38,109 --> 00:28:42,312
Fleck is a sad character, so he's going to be
mopey for a lot of this runtime. You know,

311
00:28:42,332 --> 00:28:46,336
he's in prison and the character of Harley Quinn
starts kind of bringing him out of his shell.

312
00:28:46,656 --> 00:28:51,240
And I totally saw the difference between his
pre-Harley Quinn state and his post-Harley

313
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:56,084
Quinn state. So I definitely think that honestly,
for such a terrible film, he still gave an

314
00:28:56,184 --> 00:29:00,351
Oscar caliber performance here. It's just gonna
be sad that, you know, he's not gonna get any

315
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:06,276
recognition for that because of how terrible
the writing was at the end. Right. Yeah. Now,

316
00:29:06,356 --> 00:29:10,940
Arthur's arc in the first film was all about
being seen. He felt invisible, like no one

317
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:16,084
saw or cared about him, someone who was abused
and needed help in a harsh world. It wasn't

318
00:29:16,104 --> 00:29:20,668
until he struck back, killing three men who
had been beating him, that he started to get

319
00:29:20,748 --> 00:29:26,733
noticed and he thrived on that newfound attention.
This sequel asks whether or not the Joker was

320
00:29:26,753 --> 00:29:32,160
an alternate persona. and we do get an answer
from Arthur himself that Joker was simply an

321
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:38,303
act, a mask of sorts that he was able to hide
behind to do or say things under a guise of

322
00:29:38,424 --> 00:29:43,787
anonymity. But Arthur's mask becomes a symbol
for the oppressed rising up against the elite,

323
00:29:44,187 --> 00:29:49,030
and it's a cause he never intended to start.
And by the start of this film, he's largely

324
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:54,993
removed from the fanaticism surrounding him
until he meets Harley and his trial starts.

325
00:29:55,582 --> 00:30:00,264
In the same way that Arthur initially became
drunk on the attention he received as Joker,

326
00:30:00,804 --> 00:30:07,086
Arthur in this film becomes intoxicated by Harley's
infatuation with him and seemingly the perceived

327
00:30:07,207 --> 00:30:13,669
mission of the Joker. The guy's incredibly lonely
and is tantalized by the prospect of a normal

328
00:30:13,749 --> 00:30:19,872
life with a family and in the end he chooses
that over any kind of revolution. Arthur never

329
00:30:19,932 --> 00:30:25,450
wanted to change society, he wanted to be a
part of it. and not be rejected by it as someone

330
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:31,612
with mental illness. One of the reasons I feel
this film is so pointless is that Arthur is

331
00:30:31,672 --> 00:30:37,573
so unbelievably tragic and you pity him and
you hope for him and all of that hope is dashed.

332
00:30:38,013 --> 00:30:43,135
Yeah, he dies at the end. He gets stabbed and
nothing happens. What the fuck? Yeah. He like

333
00:30:43,195 --> 00:30:49,677
dies basically alone and no one cares that we
know of. It's just it's OK. Thanks. Thank you.

334
00:30:50,177 --> 00:30:56,119
Thanks a lot, Todd Phillips. You jerk. One of
the biggest things that upset me about the

335
00:30:56,199 --> 00:31:02,903
film regarding the character of the Joker is
trying to determine what the exact catalyst

336
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:09,647
was for him turning his back on his made up
persona. Now, there are a lot of events that

337
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:14,230
happened that you could say served as that catalyst
for his change of heart. Whether it was the

338
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:19,453
testimony of Gary Puddles, his friend, or because
his friend Ricky died who he had inspired.

339
00:31:20,954 --> 00:31:24,856
Or maybe it was because the guards beat the
shit out of him and then raped him. Uh, which

340
00:31:25,137 --> 00:31:29,640
I was not okay with. Like I don't understand
why they needed to include the scene. The idea

341
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:34,523
that you can make the argument that the reason
Joker changed his mind about everything was

342
00:31:34,563 --> 00:31:40,808
because he got sodomized just infuriates me.
We don't know what the exact catalyst is, but

343
00:31:40,848 --> 00:31:46,311
the argument could be made that his rape caused
this change of heart. Like I, I don't understand

344
00:31:46,351 --> 00:31:50,534
what kind of movie this is that would include
something like that. I just didn't appreciate

345
00:31:50,574 --> 00:31:56,177
it as a fan of the character or as a fan of
the first film. Or as a human being? Exactly.

346
00:31:56,697 --> 00:32:02,099
Yeah, it's not explicit what happens to him
in the showers, although I think it's pretty

347
00:32:02,139 --> 00:32:07,842
clear what they were trying to imply. I for
one though don't think that was the catalyst.

348
00:32:07,962 --> 00:32:13,044
I think ultimately what it was, was the death
of Ricky. You saw Arthur lying there in his

349
00:32:13,104 --> 00:32:19,131
cell after what just happened to him and he's
listening. to this guy who took a liking to

350
00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:26,394
Arthur and was definitely, like you said, inspired
by him, die as a consequence of Arthur's actions

351
00:32:26,574 --> 00:32:32,796
riling up the inmates as the Joker, as a figure
of someone who's standing up for himself. It

352
00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:38,218
gave Ricky a courage that he didn't have before,
and he died because of it. But there was no

353
00:32:38,278 --> 00:32:42,420
clear indication that Arthur Fleck cared at
all about Ricky. Well, there was a number of

354
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:48,687
times that Ricky was the first to stand up for
Arthur. He would sit next to him in the prison

355
00:32:48,727 --> 00:32:54,209
courtyard. And I think he had a closer relationship
with Ricky than many of the other inmates,

356
00:32:54,309 --> 00:33:00,972
you could argue. And by nature, Arthur is a
sympathetic guy. Like he cares about other

357
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:07,034
people. And I think one of those people he did
care about was Ricky because he liked him and

358
00:33:07,114 --> 00:33:11,976
Arthur likes people who like him. So I actually
think it was that realization that the symbol

359
00:33:12,036 --> 00:33:18,059
of him could put innocence at risk. I think
that was ultimately his decision. I'm not 100%

360
00:33:18,699 --> 00:33:22,941
on that. I'm sure other arguments could be made,
but that's what I thought about. Because I

361
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:27,282
was like, yeah, I was like, what happened? What
was the catalyst? What changed his mind? And

362
00:33:27,302 --> 00:33:31,904
that was the conclusion I came to. Yeah, personally,
I think it was the testimony of Gary Puddles.

363
00:33:32,865 --> 00:33:37,367
Even though right up until the moment he got
the shit kicked out of him by the guards, he

364
00:33:37,387 --> 00:33:42,369
was still being honorary. He said to the guards,
I guess I'm in trouble, joking around right

365
00:33:42,409 --> 00:33:47,015
before they did that to him. Yeah, still making
jokes like, Oh, aren't you going to buy me

366
00:33:47,055 --> 00:33:52,179
dinner first? Yeah. Which I know there's actually
a number of jokes that were very dark like

367
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,703
that one, like I hope you get cancer, things
like that. You mentioned Arthur being ornery

368
00:33:56,783 --> 00:34:01,687
even after his questioning of Gary and leading
up to him talking with the guards and stuff

369
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:06,611
like that. He was actually ornery going all
the way up to his closing arguments in front

370
00:34:06,631 --> 00:34:10,054
of the jury, pulling up the stool, grabbing
the microphone like he was going to do a stand

371
00:34:10,094 --> 00:34:17,103
up bit. Even the judge saw that coming. So I
was completely. taken aback when he didn't

372
00:34:17,483 --> 00:34:22,265
do anything as noteworthy as his conversation
with Marie Franklin from the first film. I

373
00:34:22,305 --> 00:34:26,747
thought all chaos was about to break loose like
in that movie and it was the exact opposite.

374
00:34:26,787 --> 00:34:31,909
It wasn't a bang. It was a complete absolute
whimper and one that I felt really betrayed

375
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:36,010
by. Probably in the same way that Arthur felt
betrayed by Lee. And speaking of which, let's

376
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:42,133
move on to Harleen Quinzel played by Lady Gaga.
I'm not a huge fan of Lady Gaga's music. I'm

377
00:34:42,153 --> 00:34:46,917
not really familiar with it. But the mere fact
that they cast a musician who can't act got

378
00:34:46,937 --> 00:34:51,862
me pretty excited when her casting was first
announced. And I think she did a terrific job

379
00:34:51,982 --> 00:34:56,226
in the role. I don't think she's a better Harley
Quinn than Margot Robbie, but I also think

380
00:34:56,266 --> 00:35:00,670
that's because of what was on the page. For
as different as they made Harley Quinn in this

381
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:07,357
movie, I also think Lady Gaga did a great job
capturing the crazy slash dangerous aspect

382
00:35:07,457 --> 00:35:12,748
of the character. She was as interesting in
the role as Joaquin Phoenix is as the Joker.

383
00:35:13,128 --> 00:35:17,071
I found it really fascinating what they did
with the character and it had so much potential,

384
00:35:17,251 --> 00:35:23,415
so much promise. The crazy was palpable. 100%.
And I appreciated that for sure. Now in the

385
00:35:23,435 --> 00:35:28,019
comics, Harley was a psychiatrist at Arkham
who was manipulated by the Joker into falling

386
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:33,482
in love with him and becoming a henchwoman for
him to abuse. This film is sort of the opposite

387
00:35:33,522 --> 00:35:39,414
of that. Arthur Fleck isn't confident enough
to entice a romantic partner. But Harley, or

388
00:35:39,494 --> 00:35:44,778
Lee as she's called in this film, is crazy enough
to check herself into a mental institution

389
00:35:44,858 --> 00:35:50,922
just to get close to Joker. It's mentioned that
she did postgraduate work in psychiatry, and

390
00:35:50,962 --> 00:35:56,525
I'd like to think that simply by studying Arthur
Fleck's case, she pitied him and empathized

391
00:35:56,545 --> 00:36:02,149
with him to the point that she took on his worldview.
And that's the whole reason behind the title

392
00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:08,867
of Folly Ado. But that backstory is never explored,
so I may just be giving the film too much credit.

393
00:36:09,247 --> 00:36:15,469
You know, Folly I Do refers to a shared delusional
disorder. And outside of my headcanon, I can't

394
00:36:15,489 --> 00:36:20,510
think of what else the title would be in context
to in the film. I mean, that's a great headcanon,

395
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:25,812
but it's also one that the film doesn't deserve,
because if the film was better and smarter,

396
00:36:25,852 --> 00:36:30,213
they would have done exactly that. Exactly.
Now, Harley met Arthur while she was in music

397
00:36:30,253 --> 00:36:36,519
therapy class, and she uses song manipulate
him, drawing out the Joker from Arthur like

398
00:36:36,539 --> 00:36:42,360
a Gotham City siren, with the intention of helping
the Joker usher in a new world, seemingly,

399
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:48,662
though it's not clear why. Maybe it was out
of guilt for her affluent upbringing, or maybe

400
00:36:48,722 --> 00:36:53,744
she knew some kind of ugly underbelly within
the elite world that helped her identify with

401
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:59,545
Arthur's victimization. It's a huge mystery,
and one that should have been expanded upon.

402
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:03,147
Yeah, what did she mean by we're going to build
a mountain? Now, I know it was a reference

403
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:06,908
to a song, but I have no idea what the metaphor
was in reference to in the context of this

404
00:37:06,948 --> 00:37:11,470
film. I was thinking that it was going to be
like a literal pile of corpses that they were

405
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:17,093
going to build this new world upon. And so my
expectations were completely dashed. Yeah,

406
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:20,474
same. Instead of a mountain, it was more like
a pile of shit, you know, we're going to build

407
00:37:20,494 --> 00:37:26,056
a pile of shit, apparently. At the end of the
film, when Arthur has given up the act of the

408
00:37:26,096 --> 00:37:31,719
Joker, Harley tries singing to him again. And
when he's like, no, stop singing. I just want

409
00:37:31,739 --> 00:37:36,143
to talk. I think that's when she realizes that
she can't manipulate him anymore. And so she

410
00:37:36,183 --> 00:37:42,048
abandons him like everyone else has. Possibly.
At the end of the film, Arthur is informed

411
00:37:42,088 --> 00:37:46,972
that he has a visitor waiting for him. And that's
when he's killed. Do you think that visitor

412
00:37:47,172 --> 00:37:51,496
was Harley? Did she have a change of heart?
That's a good question. I don't know who else

413
00:37:51,576 --> 00:37:55,739
it could possibly be. Maybe it was his former
lawyer. Those are the only two people I can

414
00:37:55,759 --> 00:38:01,199
think of. Well, it could have been Gary. Oh,
yeah. That's true. I think Gary was too afraid

415
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:05,341
of Arthur, though, to do that, in my opinion.
Possibly. But he was still, I think, like the

416
00:38:05,361 --> 00:38:11,125
closest thing he had to a friend, maybe. So,
yeah, it was probably either Harley or his

417
00:38:11,185 --> 00:38:16,508
lawyer. And in that sense, maybe there is sort
of like this romantic tragedy at the very end.

418
00:38:16,848 --> 00:38:23,713
But we'll never know. Yeah. Fuck it. Who cares?
Damn it. It's all pointless. Let's move on

419
00:38:23,753 --> 00:38:24,913

427
00:39:18,914 --> 00:39:24,318
Now the film opens with an animated, Looney
Tunes-esque cartoon sequence showing Arthur

428
00:39:24,358 --> 00:39:29,563
Fleck arrive at the Marie Franklin show, only
to be beaten and impersonated by his shadow

429
00:39:29,803 --> 00:39:35,468
who acts on Arthur's worst impulses, humiliates
him, and leaves Arthur to take the rap, a victim

430
00:39:35,528 --> 00:39:41,152
of his shadow, and police brutality. In the
real world, Arthur is medicated and imprisoned

431
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:45,956
in the criminal wing of Arkham State Hospital,
where he awaits trial for the murder of five

432
00:39:46,016 --> 00:39:51,635
people two years prior. While imprisoned, he's
abused and ridiculed by the security guards

433
00:39:51,675 --> 00:39:56,817
for their amusement, as his ordeal was made
into a made-for-TV film and has made him a

434
00:39:56,877 --> 00:40:02,279
minor public celebrity. On his way to meet his
lawyer, Mary Ann Stewart, Arthur is escorted

435
00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:09,122
past a music therapy class where he first encounters
a patient named Harleen Quinzel, aka Lee. While

436
00:40:09,162 --> 00:40:13,324
meeting with Mary Ann, she explains her hopes
that they can argue Arthur has dissociative

437
00:40:13,424 --> 00:40:18,142
identity disorder and is mentally unfit to be
held accountable for his crimes. having can

438
00:40:18,222 --> 00:40:23,104
meet with a psychologist to gather evidence
for her case. Now, the animated opening was

439
00:40:23,124 --> 00:40:27,506
an interesting surprise. It was actually created
by the same studio that did the triplets of

440
00:40:27,566 --> 00:40:33,049
Belleville, which is a fantastic animated film.
Yeah, I was really taken back by the opening.

441
00:40:33,109 --> 00:40:37,871
I thought it was pretty clever, actually. I
just like cartoons, you know, and the idea

442
00:40:37,911 --> 00:40:42,073
of having the movie open with a cartoon kind
of brought me back to, you know, the 1989.

443
00:40:42,954 --> 00:40:47,756
VHS copy of the Batman movie that you had with
Bugs Bunny and Duffy Duck and I don't know

444
00:40:47,776 --> 00:40:54,179
if this was an homage to that per se but it
was At least an interesting way at the very

445
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,362
least to open your film. That's right You can't
watch your Warner Brothers movie with our Warner

446
00:40:58,382 --> 00:41:06,114
Brothers ballcat Now regarding Arthur's trial
for the murder of five victims I was trying

447
00:41:06,134 --> 00:41:10,776
to count in my head the five victims. Now we
knew that he killed the three people on the

448
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:15,519
subway, that he killed the clown who bullied
him. And we know that he killed Murray Franklin

449
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:19,981
live on TV. So right away, I was like frustrated
thinking that they had got the number wrong

450
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:24,224
because we knew that he killed his mom. And
I was under the assumption that he did kills

451
00:41:24,364 --> 00:41:29,426
as a beats character from the first Joker film.
So I had my number at seven. I was actually

452
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:33,269
higher than that because I assumed he killed
the psychiatrist lady at the end of the movie

453
00:41:33,309 --> 00:41:37,978
as well. Right, right, right. Yeah, I was wondering
about her too, and then I was surprised to

454
00:41:37,998 --> 00:41:42,900
see that, you know, he didn't kill the psychiatrist
at the end of The First Joker. Yeah, so this

455
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:47,821
film actually answered quite a number of questions
as to who was killed in the first movie and

456
00:41:47,861 --> 00:41:53,103
who wasn't. I'm actually pretty happy that Zazie
Beats and her daughter were not killed. Right.

457
00:41:53,423 --> 00:41:57,904
Yeah, because I think we described her state
as kind of like a Schrodinger's cat type situation.

458
00:41:58,044 --> 00:42:02,785
You know, she was neither alive nor dead until
the movie chose to reveal that fact, and here

459
00:42:02,805 --> 00:42:07,340
they did. What is your theory as to what the
hell is up with Brandon Gleason's character?

460
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:11,542
Like, he obviously wasn't a nice guy. They kind
of portrayed him as a fairly straightforward

461
00:42:11,602 --> 00:42:16,425
prison guard who was an asshole, right? But
he wasn't always an asshole. It was really

462
00:42:16,445 --> 00:42:21,187
hard to crack his character, I found. He wasn't
consistent in the slightest. I think he just

463
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:26,410
enjoyed being entertained by Arthur. I think
he enjoyed kind of the celebrity of Arthur.

464
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:31,653
I was just kind of semi-fascinated by that.
The fact that he had power over someone who

465
00:42:31,673 --> 00:42:37,103
was a celebrity. That's what I got. He almost
wanted to tease Arthur by taking him to the

466
00:42:37,123 --> 00:42:41,285
music classes, but also it was kind of just
an excuse for him to sing as well, because

467
00:42:41,345 --> 00:42:46,867
the dude loved to sing. Now, after Jackie Sullivan,
a security guard known for singing, gets Arthur

468
00:42:46,907 --> 00:42:52,409
to kiss a fellow criminal inmate named Ricky
for the guard's amusement, Jackie informs Arthur

469
00:42:52,429 --> 00:42:57,352
that he signed him up for a music therapy class
due to his good behavior. During his first

470
00:42:57,432 --> 00:43:01,993
session, Lee tells Arthur that she was forced
into the mental care facility by her mother,

471
00:43:02,462 --> 00:43:06,504
after setting fire to an apartment building,
that she lives in the same neighborhood he

472
00:43:06,544 --> 00:43:11,527
did, that her father died, and that she's a
big fan of the movie they made of Arthur's

473
00:43:11,567 --> 00:43:17,711
crimes. Arthur, beguiled by Lee, confesses to
her that he actually killed six people, including

474
00:43:17,751 --> 00:43:22,654
his mother. Upon his return to the hospital's
criminal wing, Arthur learns that district

475
00:43:22,674 --> 00:43:27,737
attorney Harvey Dent is seeking the death penalty
for Arthur's crimes, sending Arthur into an

476
00:43:29,558 --> 00:43:34,844
before succumbing to a fit of uncontrollable
laughter in reality. The song that played while

477
00:43:34,884 --> 00:43:40,590
all the inmates were watching TV made me realize,
oh, Joaquin Phoenix is not a great singer,

478
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:46,517
at least not in the musical theater type of
sense. Oh yeah, I don't know if he's ever been

479
00:43:46,537 --> 00:43:54,795
a stage performer, but I could see where he
hasn't. He has been in a band though, I know

480
00:43:54,835 --> 00:43:59,239
that. Yeah, yeah. I don't remember if he was
the lead singer or not though. But not every

481
00:43:59,459 --> 00:44:04,323
lead singer in a band can be in a musical. It's
just a different type of voice training really.

482
00:44:04,363 --> 00:44:08,967
True. So it was kind of awkward hearing him
sing in this moment and being like, oh shit,

483
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:13,851
no. Yeah, that's harsh. I didn't think he was
that bad. Now the scene after that where he

484
00:44:13,871 --> 00:44:19,195
was crying out on the rain really communicated
the message that he is afraid of dying. He

485
00:44:19,235 --> 00:44:23,626
does not want to receive the death penalty at
the hands of the state. Yeah, that was a pretty

486
00:44:23,746 --> 00:44:30,070
powerful scene and brought up an interesting
theme of the fear of mortality. But it wasn't

487
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:35,753
one that was really expanded upon too much more
considering that Arthur had something to live

488
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:41,797
for now. That was Lee. Mm hmm. I do think perhaps
that scene was misplaced. I think it was just

489
00:44:42,117 --> 00:44:46,680
a really powerful performance by Joaquin Phoenix
and they had to put it somewhere. And so they

490
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,726
put it there. I don't think that's the only
place you could have put it, though. Honestly,

491
00:44:50,826 --> 00:44:55,549
I would have saved that for the very, very end
after Lee dumped him and he was back in Arkham.

492
00:44:55,869 --> 00:45:00,251
That would have been perfect. Absolutely. Now
during a movie screening of the 1954 musical

493
00:45:00,271 --> 00:45:06,154
The Bandwagon for the musical therapy animates,
Lee sets fire to a piano to get Arthur's attention,

494
00:45:06,474 --> 00:45:11,657
and the two escape the hospital building alone,
singing and dancing together and capturing

495
00:45:11,677 --> 00:45:16,300
the attention of press outside the hospital
who wanted Arthur to comment on his upcoming

496
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:22,055
trial. After the two are captured by the hospital
guards, Arthur is placed in solitary confinement,

497
00:45:22,435 --> 00:45:28,439
where he dreams of dancing with Lee upon the
Gotham rooftops. Upon awakening from a dream,

498
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:34,242
Arthur finds Lee beside him, claiming one of
the guards let her in, and she informs him

499
00:45:34,382 --> 00:45:38,985
that the hospital is sending her home because
he's a bad influence on her. While painting

500
00:45:39,025 --> 00:45:44,028
his face with Joker makeup, she encourages him
to stop taking his medication, promising that

501
00:45:44,068 --> 00:45:49,155
they'll build a mountain and be together. when
his trial is over before the two have sex in

502
00:45:49,215 --> 00:45:53,236
Arthur's cell. Now, I totally thought that this
was a scene that was all in Arthur's head,

503
00:45:53,256 --> 00:45:58,719
because no way in hell did I ever think that
a prison guard would let another mental patient

504
00:45:58,939 --> 00:46:04,181
into Arthur's cell for a conjugal visit or anything
like that, you know? It just didn't make sense.

505
00:46:05,081 --> 00:46:09,723
It wasn't until we hear Lee speaking to reporters
about how they're going to build a mountain

506
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:14,125
referencing the line that she had previously
told him in the cell that I realized, okay,

507
00:46:14,145 --> 00:46:18,348
so maybe that did happen. It still just doesn't
make any sense to me. Well, I didn't realize

508
00:46:18,388 --> 00:46:24,512
it until she told him that she was pregnant.
And I was like, oh, wait, so that was real,

509
00:46:24,632 --> 00:46:30,116
what? I guess if he was gonna make up a love
scene between him and Lee, that he probably

510
00:46:30,176 --> 00:46:35,620
would have performed better, is what I'll say.
Hey man, it was probably his first time, he

511
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:39,931
did his best. That's true, that's true. This
musical number where they're dancing on the

512
00:46:39,971 --> 00:46:45,334
rooftops was actually my favorite musical scene.
You know, you have Lady Gaga silhouetted against

513
00:46:45,394 --> 00:46:50,637
the full moon and you have the sign on the rooftop
that says Arkham Hotel. I just thought it was

514
00:46:50,677 --> 00:46:55,039
beautifully rendered. Oh, absolutely. Yeah,
the dancing was fantastic. There was actually

515
00:46:55,340 --> 00:47:00,803
no singing in that scene. But yeah, it was great
as a dream sequence. Now, in an attempt to

516
00:47:00,823 --> 00:47:06,526
garner public support for Arthur and the argument
that he has a split personality. Mary Ann schedules

517
00:47:06,626 --> 00:47:12,571
a live television interview with a sensationalist
journalist named Patty Myers, who riles Arthur

518
00:47:12,671 --> 00:47:17,474
up into singing about his love for Lee. The
next day, Arthur arrives at the courthouse

519
00:47:17,494 --> 00:47:22,718
with hundreds of protesters outside, both for
and against him. While Harvey and Mary Ann

520
00:47:22,738 --> 00:47:28,022
question several mental professionals in regards
to the possibility of Arthur's split personality,

521
00:47:28,462 --> 00:47:33,526
Lee shows up late to the trial and argues with
Mary Ann in front of the press, about how her

522
00:47:33,586 --> 00:47:38,950
approach is making Arthur look bad for his fans.
After advocating for more involvement from

523
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:44,375
Lee, Arthur learns from Marianne while back
in his cell that Lee has been lying to him,

524
00:47:44,715 --> 00:47:50,039
that she actually grew up with wealthy parents
who are still alive, studied postgraduate psychology,

525
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:56,725
and checked herself in and out of Arkham willingly.
When Lee visits Arthur and he confronts her,

526
00:47:57,005 --> 00:48:01,489
she confesses to everything but convinces him
that she still loves him, that she's moved

527
00:48:01,529 --> 00:48:06,372
into his old home. and that she's pregnant with
his child. The Patty Meyers interview with

528
00:48:06,472 --> 00:48:11,694
actor Steve Coogan, I thought was going to be
a much bigger thing than it was in the actual

529
00:48:11,754 --> 00:48:16,537
movie. I thought Steve Coogan's life was going
to be threatened in some way. I'm not sure

530
00:48:16,577 --> 00:48:21,580
why, but I also thought this was like the weirdest
musical performance of the entire movie. Yeah,

531
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,962
I was actually surprised Patty just let his
interview essentially become a music video.

532
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:30,325
You know, the cameras were zooming in on Arthur
as he was singing and everything like that

533
00:48:30,345 --> 00:48:36,096
and the whole thing just totally got derailed.
It's things like that, like that moment and

534
00:48:36,216 --> 00:48:40,118
even the judge letting Joker wear makeup in
the courtroom and stuff like that, that just

535
00:48:40,198 --> 00:48:46,762
add this surreal, unbelievable quality to the
film that just didn't ring true and was kind

536
00:48:46,802 --> 00:48:51,905
of annoying. Well, another thing similar to
that was during the Patty interview when Lee

537
00:48:51,945 --> 00:48:57,888
was watching from outside a department store
window with televisions. She's rich. Go inside.

538
00:48:58,328 --> 00:49:03,447
Buy the TV. You don't need to break the window.
grab the TV and then walk away and get away

539
00:49:03,467 --> 00:49:07,250
with it. Like people saw you do that. Yeah,
I'm surprised nobody confronted her about it.

540
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:14,335
I was actually pretty excited when I saw Ken
Lung, a psychiatrist up on the stand as one

541
00:49:14,375 --> 00:49:20,140
of the expert witnesses for the prosecution.
I thought that was Hugo Strange because I totally

542
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:25,664
didn't hear them say his name during the movie.
But after doing my research, it turns out that's

543
00:49:25,764 --> 00:49:31,343
Dr. Victor Liu. So that was... I feel like a
wasted opportunity. When Marianne calls Arthur's

544
00:49:31,483 --> 00:49:37,625
old neighbor and romantic crush Sophie Dumond
to the stand, Arthur is reminded of past childhood

545
00:49:37,665 --> 00:49:42,267
trauma while learning the hurtful truth of how
his mother expressed her feelings toward him

546
00:49:42,587 --> 00:49:49,590
to others. Enraged and humiliated, Arthur fires
Marianne, and that evening, the prisoners riot

547
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:55,233
as they cheer on Arthur for standing up to authority.
The next day, Arthur represents himself at

548
00:49:55,253 --> 00:50:00,815
the trial while wearing Joker makeup. While
questioning his former co-worker, Gary Puddles,

549
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:07,438
on the stand, Arthur argues that those who he
killed deserved to die. Gary reveals to Arthur,

550
00:50:07,478 --> 00:50:12,841
however, that his actions have more victims
than just the men who hurt Arthur. Victims

551
00:50:12,921 --> 00:50:18,163
like Gary, who witnessed one of the murders
and is still traumatized by it. After Harvey

552
00:50:18,283 --> 00:50:24,086
rests his case, Arthur refuses to call any more
witnesses in his defense. instead chastising

553
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:28,808
society and insulting the hospital guards, after
which Arthur leaves the courtroom with Lee

554
00:50:29,088 --> 00:50:34,270
and the two fantasize about getting married.
The Gary Puddles questioning I thought was

555
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:41,053
a really powerful scene in the movie. I'm not
sure why WKF decided to go with the Southern

556
00:50:41,253 --> 00:50:47,496
accent for the Joker in this scene, but to me
it wasn't necessarily as important as him breaking

557
00:50:47,536 --> 00:50:54,034
character when he was realizing what Gary was
saying was true. I think he was just kind of

558
00:50:54,154 --> 00:50:59,335
emulating some of the more popular Southern
lawyers in the vein of like Gose of Mississippi

559
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:03,417
or the Lincoln lawyer or something like that.
I don't think it was necessary because I don't

560
00:51:03,457 --> 00:51:09,278
think that like Southern lawyer archetype is
broadly known, but I do think that the Gary

561
00:51:09,298 --> 00:51:13,660
Puddles questioning was the strongest scene
of the film. Yeah, one of them for sure. I

562
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:19,841
totally agree. The judge in this trial just
fucking sucked though, man. Like, why the hell

563
00:51:19,861 --> 00:51:24,316
did he not put Arthur Fleck in contempt of court,
or at least, you know, like silence him when

564
00:51:24,336 --> 00:51:27,979
he was going off on his rant. I guess it didn't
matter if he held him in contempt because he's

565
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:32,262
already in prison and everything like that,
but he should have called for order so many

566
00:51:32,302 --> 00:51:37,446
more times than he did in the course of this
trial. Yeah, 100% he should have. I thought

567
00:51:37,466 --> 00:51:42,849
it was weird how they had that sequence of Joker
and Harley getting married. Like, why include

568
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:47,873
that if it's not going to happen? I understand
you want to show maybe Joaquin Phoenix fantasizing

569
00:51:47,893 --> 00:51:53,823
about that. But he did it after a moment when
he ran off with Lee. So it's almost like it

570
00:51:53,843 --> 00:51:58,925
was a shared fantasy between them. When, if
there was a shared fantasy between them, why

571
00:51:58,965 --> 00:52:03,306
didn't they get married in real life? There's
probably no opportunity to. I think you could

572
00:52:03,446 --> 00:52:08,888
marry someone who's locked up. All you have
to do is sign papers. Don't ask me, man. Now

573
00:52:08,908 --> 00:52:14,109
upon returning to Arkham, Joker is assaulted,
seemingly sexually, by the guards in the hospital

574
00:52:14,149 --> 00:52:19,413
showers. After being dragged back to his cell,
Arthur listens as the inmate Ricky gets riled

575
00:52:19,473 --> 00:52:24,097
up and is strangled to death by the guards.
The next day in the courtroom, Arthur prepares

576
00:52:24,117 --> 00:52:29,082
to go on a tirade during his closing remarks
to the jury, blaming society for his life and

577
00:52:29,222 --> 00:52:34,086
actions, but instead he confesses that it wasn't
an alternate personality that killed those

578
00:52:34,126 --> 00:52:39,510
people, that the Joker persona isn't something
he grapples with or a rebellious cause of the

579
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:45,507
disenfranchised that he wants to champion. Enraged,
Lee storms out of the courtroom and returns

580
00:52:45,547 --> 00:52:50,951
home, where she seemingly attempts suicide as
Arthur leaves a voicemail expressing his feelings

581
00:52:51,011 --> 00:52:57,696
for her. That was strange. Like, super strange.
I don't understand why they had that attempted

582
00:52:57,776 --> 00:53:03,239
suicide scene with Harley if they didn't address
it in any way, shape or form later on. It just

583
00:53:03,259 --> 00:53:08,043
seemed kind of random. It feels like there was
a missing scene. Yeah, that's what it feels

584
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:12,434
like. Like, why didn't she go through with it?
Why did she give herself a haircut? Why was

585
00:53:12,454 --> 00:53:16,456
she just like hanging out on the steps? Was
she waiting for Arthur? Was she responsible

586
00:53:16,496 --> 00:53:21,700
for the bomb? Yeah. No idea. My guess is that
she struggled with pulling the trigger, decided

587
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:27,764
not to cut her hair, and let the Joker go from
her life. Basically deciding that this facade

588
00:53:27,784 --> 00:53:32,147
of a guy was not worth killing herself over.
That's like another headcanon piece regarding

589
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:35,850
the character of Harley Quinn that they should
have shown in the movie, and they didn't. So

590
00:53:35,890 --> 00:53:39,652
many better scenes could have been included
in this film other than these musical numbers

591
00:53:39,692 --> 00:53:46,390
that were just totally unnecessary. 100% Absolutely.
That is the truthiest truth that has been truth

592
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:52,535
on this review. Now when the jury reads their
guilty verdict, Arthur begins laughing uncontrollably,

593
00:53:52,835 --> 00:53:57,579
causing a member of one of the victim's families
to attack him. In the chaos of the courtroom,

594
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:04,325
a random car bomb explodes outside the courthouse,
injuring many in the courtroom, including scarring

595
00:54:04,485 --> 00:54:09,509
one half of Harvey's face. When a dazed Arthur
stumbles out of the rubble into the street,

596
00:54:09,998 --> 00:54:15,679
He encounters a man dressed as Joker, who helps
him get into his friend's car. As the two drive

597
00:54:15,699 --> 00:54:20,920
away discussing how Arthur is going to help
bring to a head a societal revolution, Arthur

598
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:25,482
escapes the vehicle and eventually makes his
way to the steps outside of his old apartment,

599
00:54:25,682 --> 00:54:31,583
where he finds Lee, still alive, but with a
new haircut. Rather than flee with Arthur,

600
00:54:31,943 --> 00:54:36,365
Lee tells him it's over between them and that
their relationship was only ever a fantasy,

601
00:54:36,765 --> 00:54:42,103
while cops surround them and take Arthur back
to Arkham. The next day, Arthur is informed

602
00:54:42,163 --> 00:54:47,488
by a guard that he has a visitor, and as he
goes to see who it is, he's stopped by another

603
00:54:47,648 --> 00:54:53,914
unnamed inmate who had been observing him throughout
the film, who tells a joke expressing his disappointment

604
00:54:53,974 --> 00:54:59,359
in Arthur for giving up the Joker persona before
stabbing Arthur repeatedly in the stomach.

605
00:54:59,639 --> 00:55:05,804
Then, laughing, uses the blade to slice a smile
into his cheeks. As Arthur lays on the ground

606
00:55:05,864 --> 00:55:10,953
bleeding and dying, A smile forms on his face
just before he passes. Okay, you covered a

607
00:55:10,973 --> 00:55:15,977
lot of ground there. Going back to the bomb,
you said it was a random car bomb that went

608
00:55:16,017 --> 00:55:22,402
off. I don't think it was random, but I'm wondering
who even set the bomb. Like where did the bomb

609
00:55:22,442 --> 00:55:27,187
come from? Were they trying to kill Arthur Fleck
for disavowing the Joker or were they trying

610
00:55:27,207 --> 00:55:31,430
to free him or what was the point of it all?
Oh, that's a good question. I never considered

611
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:36,658
that someone might actually be trying to kill
Arthur. That's valid. It's random in the sense

612
00:55:36,678 --> 00:55:42,283
that we don't know why it went off or who set
it off, essentially. At first I thought maybe

613
00:55:42,303 --> 00:55:46,327
it was the people who rescued him, but that
wouldn't make sense necessarily. It's almost

614
00:55:46,347 --> 00:55:51,411
like the guy in the Joker makeup had no idea
what was going on with the trial because him

615
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:55,214
and his buddy were talking about how Arthur
Fleck was going to change the world and everything

616
00:55:55,234 --> 00:56:00,979
like that, but he had just got done disavowing
the Joker, right? I want to know why everyone

617
00:56:01,019 --> 00:56:07,124
seemingly got horribly injured in this blast.
and yet Joker, who was pretty close to it,

618
00:56:07,484 --> 00:56:13,610
was not. That's a great question. It felt inconsistent.
Friggin' Harvey Dent got his face all fucked

619
00:56:13,670 --> 00:56:17,934
up. That was actually a pretty neat moment,
I thought. That was cool, that was cool. I

620
00:56:17,974 --> 00:56:22,218
like the actor who played Harvey Dent. I agree,
I liked the choice that they went with. I liked

621
00:56:22,238 --> 00:56:27,122
his voice, he did a fantastic job. Now, as I
mentioned earlier, there are set photos that

622
00:56:27,162 --> 00:56:32,667
were taken while filming was occurring of Harley
pushing. Arthur down the steps and that's what

623
00:56:32,707 --> 00:56:38,292
I thought was going to happen. It should have
happened. Yeah, possibly. Either that or they

624
00:56:38,332 --> 00:56:42,615
went off together, but I totally thought that
Harley was going to kill Joker in that moment.

625
00:56:42,855 --> 00:56:49,221
I've seen people say that the man who kills
Arthur at the end is the Dark Knight's Heath

626
00:56:49,261 --> 00:56:54,865
Ledger's Joker. This is obviously not the same
universe as The Dark Knight considering we

627
00:56:54,885 --> 00:57:00,394
have different origin stories for Harvey Dent
and the death of the Waynes. Right. Oh, yeah,

628
00:57:00,434 --> 00:57:06,055
this is totally not Heath Ledger's Joker. I
think maybe they were trying to reference that

629
00:57:06,075 --> 00:57:10,657
version of the Joker. But no, there are too
many discrepancies between this universe that

630
00:57:10,817 --> 00:57:15,698
Arthur Fleck exists in and the Dark Knight's
continuity. And after this movie, I don't want

631
00:57:15,738 --> 00:57:21,440
them to be related. Like this movie already
kind of ruined the first Joker movie. Don't

632
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:27,902
let it ruin the Dark Knight trilogy as well.
Now, we've been bashing on this film for. the

633
00:57:28,002 --> 00:57:33,406
whole duration of this review basically. I do
want to emphasize though that for the most

634
00:57:33,446 --> 00:57:39,572
part, I thought the film was really well made
and I liked it up until the final moments.

635
00:57:39,892 --> 00:57:45,216
Because once Arthur disavowed the Joker, the
film was essentially anti-climax after anti-climax

636
00:57:45,557 --> 00:57:52,442
after yet another anti-climax. And therefore
unbelievably disappointing as a comic fan or

637
00:57:52,623 --> 00:58:00,316
the lover of story in general. I think the film's
craze-worthy performances and gorgeous cinematography

638
00:58:00,457 --> 00:58:06,221
just can't salvage the poor punchline of an
ending in this ultimately disappointing follow-up

639
00:58:06,341 --> 00:58:12,265
to the original, which again was fantastic.
I really, really wanted to give this film three

640
00:58:12,325 --> 00:58:20,351
stars, but upon doing this review, I realized
I can't in good conscience do that. I liked

641
00:58:20,391 --> 00:58:25,819
the movie up until the final act for the most
part, but There are a lot of problems throughout

642
00:58:25,859 --> 00:58:31,923
the film, not just in the final act. So I'm
giving it two and a half out of five stars,

643
00:58:32,483 --> 00:58:37,847
a rotten rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Yeah, I
think I would go along that route too. Two

644
00:58:37,867 --> 00:58:42,230
and a half sounds fair. You know, it's an F
rating. Definitely not recommended. Definitely

645
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:47,253
getting a rotten tomato from me. I just can't
believe how disappointed I was walking out

646
00:58:47,293 --> 00:58:52,260
of the theater. Dude, and that being even from
someone who didn't have the highest of expectations

647
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:57,384
for the film regardless, it just on so many
levels was not the movie that it should have

648
00:58:57,404 --> 00:59:01,347
been. It didn't live up to its potential set
up by the first film or even, you know, its

649
00:59:01,427 --> 00:59:06,951
premise. And that's one of the most tragic things
about this story. But you know what? As long

650
00:59:06,971 --> 00:59:11,314
as people saw the first one, they don't need
to see this one. This one, as far as I'm concerned,

651
00:59:11,835 --> 00:59:18,718
is dead to me. I don't ever want to talk about
it again. Warner Brothers had one job this

652
00:59:18,758 --> 00:59:25,621
year, one job, put out a good DC movie, and
they blew it. And that, kind of in a twisted

653
00:59:25,661 --> 00:59:31,864
way, makes me happy, because an L for DC is
a W for Marvel, as far as I'm concerned. This

654
00:59:31,924 --> 00:59:39,487
is an L for the comic book genre, because this
was supposed to be yet another film that elevated

655
00:59:39,707 --> 00:59:46,002
it to the point of it winning accolades amongst
the broader Hollywood industry. So yeah, you

656
00:59:46,022 --> 00:59:52,304
should not have a smile on your face. We should
all have our upside down Joker faces on. No,

657
00:59:52,364 --> 00:59:57,285
I think the success of Deadpool and Wolverine
is still riding pretty high. Although, you

658
00:59:57,305 --> 01:00:01,666
know, that may entirely change if the Venom
movie really sucks that's coming out in a few

659
01:00:01,706 --> 01:00:06,168
weeks and if Craven really sucks. We may be
in dire straits here as far as the genre is

660
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:10,989
concerned. I hate to tell you this, but Deadpool
and Wolverine is not winning any Oscars. I

661
01:00:11,009 --> 01:00:16,677
don't care. You should. You want the box office
saying so many people saw it. So many people

662
01:00:16,697 --> 01:00:22,042
loved it. So the Joker is just a moot point.
But it's more than that. It's way more than

663
01:00:22,062 --> 01:00:27,446
that, unfortunately. Its failure, I think, is
a massive blow to what James Gunn and Peter

664
01:00:27,486 --> 01:00:34,973
Seifert and want to do with DC Studios. It just
it's that's funny, too, though. Oh, fuck you.

665
01:00:35,073 --> 01:00:43,086
Whatever, dude, whatever. I'm done with this
review. AJ, help close this out. Thanks for
