This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,206 --> 00:00:28,527
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:33,790
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based

4
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:40,332
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother, Johnny DC. And in this episode,

5
00:00:40,352 --> 00:00:48,136
we are going to review the latest Marvel television
animated release, Hitmonkey Season 2. Hitmonkey

6
00:00:48,176 --> 00:00:53,254
Season 1 was a big surprise when we reviewed
that, I think back in 2021. And it's not surprising

7
00:00:53,334 --> 00:00:58,277
that the show got a season two and season two,
every bit as good as the first, if not even

8
00:00:58,317 --> 00:01:03,219
better. So I'm really excited to talk about
it. Yeah, absolutely. Hit Monkey is a vibe

9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,402
and I was totally there for it. And I can't
wait to talk about it. Before that, we're going

10
00:01:07,422 --> 00:01:11,464
to break down the comic book movie news that
came out this past week, of which there was

11
00:01:11,804 --> 00:01:17,047
a lot of news that came out from the recent
D23 conference. Marvel decided to save like

12
00:01:17,207 --> 00:01:22,710
all their good shit for D23, and they kind of
phoned in Comic Con. We're going to be talking

13
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,391
about the Agatha all along official trailer.
We're going to describe the footage that came

14
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:33,313
out for Captain America, Brave New World, fantastic
for first steps Daredevil, Bornegan and Ironheart.

15
00:01:33,913 --> 00:01:39,175
And we got the big news this past week that
Daredevil and Wolverine has surpassed one billion

16
00:01:39,215 --> 00:01:45,137
dollars at the worldwide box office. So it is
just a full on Marvel episode. None of that

17
00:01:45,237 --> 00:01:50,075
DC shit this time. None of that boring news
from the shit fucks down the street, as we

18
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:55,079
like to call them now. She's all Marvel. This
is going to be a fantastic episode. I'm so

19
00:01:55,179 --> 00:02:00,882
thrilled. I don't even know why I'm here. Like,
I don't need to be here. You can go. You can

20
00:02:00,922 --> 00:02:05,686
go. I'm just here to say things like shit. Damn.
And that is whack.

21
00:02:09,128 --> 00:02:15,890
OK, not another teen movie. As always guys,

Network this week, including Max Destruction,

34
00:03:18,837 --> 00:03:23,199
which pits your favorite action heroes from
film and television against each other. This

35
00:03:23,259 --> 00:03:29,442
week, hosts Scotty and Gilly are pitting the
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles against the Warriors

36
00:03:29,623 --> 00:03:35,886
of Virtue. On the Senjoworld podcast, host Zachary
Hepburn speculates on fights between fan favorite

37
00:03:36,006 --> 00:03:42,790
anime and manga characters. This Thursday, Zach's
doing an Olympic sports-themed episode. between

38
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:48,171
Team Berna and Team Mud. Yeah, that'll be an
interesting episode. None of the shows on the

39
00:03:48,211 --> 00:03:52,172
network have ever done anything like that, so
really excited to see how that sports-themed

40
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:57,554
episode goes. On the Console Combat podcast,
hosts John and Dean find out who would win

41
00:03:57,614 --> 00:04:02,015
in fights between popular video game characters.
In yesterday's episode, they determined who

42
00:04:02,035 --> 00:04:08,677
would win between Samus Aran from Metroid and
Mega Man. Visit dynamicpodcasts.com or click

44
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:20,168
But with that out of the way, quick to No Prize!
A No Prize is an award Marvel used to give

45
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:26,290
out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel No
Prize, is a digital award we pushed on Instagram

46
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:31,771
for the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week, we

47
00:04:31,991 --> 00:04:38,513
asked, other than Dynamic Duel, what is your
favorite podcast in the DynaMic Network and

48
00:04:38,593 --> 00:04:45,147
why? And we only got... one answer, but it was
a good answer. This week's no prize goes to

49
00:04:45,767 --> 00:04:53,749
Scott Camacho who said, I'm not biased or anything,
but, um, I really like max destruction. Dustin's

50
00:04:53,809 --> 00:04:59,751
cheesiness followed by Ken's quick wit makes
for a great show. And I love all the action

51
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:05,252
stars. I heard there's a new set of twins that
is going to be doing it now. So I'm definitely

52
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:10,930
going to watch out for them. That's the show
to watch. Max destruction. Yeah, Scotty is

53
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:16,314
not biased at all. It's not like he's the new
main host for Max Destruction going forward.

54
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:21,658
That's right. Yeah. Ken, the initial host of
Max Destruction, the guy who started the show,

55
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:27,483
has stepped away from the podcast and Scotty
is bringing aboard his twin brother, Gilly,

56
00:05:27,863 --> 00:05:33,548
which means that there are two sets of twins
running podcasts in the DynaMic Podcast Network.

57
00:05:34,048 --> 00:05:39,877
And we want to give a quick. Super heartfelt
shout out to Ken. We've been a fan of his ever

58
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:44,381
since he put out the you call those tactics
podcast Ken has been a huge supporter of dynamic

59
00:05:44,421 --> 00:05:49,886
duel. He was our very first executive producer
He was essentially the guy who started the

60
00:05:49,906 --> 00:05:53,849
dynaMic podcast network because he asked us
if he could start his own show and use Our

61
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:59,814
simulator and everything like that so he's just
a fucking legend in the dynaMic network community

62
00:06:00,435 --> 00:06:05,055
and We will always be happy to have him on as
a guest Yeah, he's guested on this podcast

63
00:06:05,095 --> 00:06:11,181
before for our Punisher review. The guy is just
a genius when it comes to anything military

64
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:15,766
related, considering he is active military.
That was always something interesting that

65
00:06:15,806 --> 00:06:20,650
he brought to Max Destruction, the fact that
he's a literal military strategist for the

66
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,695
army speculating on these battles. Now, Scotty,
the new host, was also in the military, so

67
00:06:25,735 --> 00:06:30,194
I'm definitely excited for his matches as well.
Oh yeah, Scotty has brought a lot to the Max

68
00:06:30,214 --> 00:06:35,537
Destruction podcast over the last few months
as he's been co-hosting and he has great chemistry

69
00:06:35,697 --> 00:06:40,839
with his brother Gilly dating back to the womb.
So we know that duo will make Ken proud and

70
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:45,001
really looking forward to seeing what they do
with the show in the future. Especially with

71
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:48,703
their upcoming episode, Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles vs. the Warriors of Virtue, that's

72
00:06:48,723 --> 00:06:53,405
going to be a great way to kick off this new
era of Max Destruction. So great answer Scotty,

73
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:57,900
you win this week's No Prize. If you the listener
want a shot at winning your own no prize, stay

74
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,383
tuned to later on in this episode when we'll
be asking another question of the week. And

75
00:07:02,423 --> 00:07:04,565
now that that's done, onto the news!

76
00:07:10,082 --> 00:07:15,765
Alright, this past weekend we had the D23 event
where Disney presents all of the upcoming projects

77
00:07:15,785 --> 00:07:20,309
they have on their slate to investors. They
showed a lot of exciting footage at the event,

78
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:24,692
which good luck finding video clips of those
on the internet, but we're going to break down

79
00:07:24,732 --> 00:07:29,655
the clips for you here. The first trailer we're
going to talk about is Agatha All Along, which

80
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:33,658
actually was released to the general public
as the official trailer. This wasn't like a

81
00:07:33,738 --> 00:07:38,721
leak or anything, but this is coming off of
the teaser trailer that we got just a few weeks

82
00:07:38,761 --> 00:07:44,499
ago. The Agatha All Along series is about the
witch getting back her powers that were taken

83
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:51,926
from her by the Scarlet Witch at the end of
Wandavision. That is whack! To do that, she

84
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:56,771
has to walk the witch's road. So she gets some
of her old witch friends to do this with her

85
00:07:57,471 --> 00:08:01,876
and they sing a song. I don't know if this is
going to be a musical or not. I guess, you

86
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:07,120
know, Wandavision had a lot of... musical elements
to it and since Agatha all along is kind of

87
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,425
a sequel of sorts to WandaVision, maybe it makes
sense that's why there's music, but it reminded

88
00:08:12,465 --> 00:08:18,791
me a lot of the Far Over the Misty Mountains
Cold song from the first Hobbit movie as Agatha

89
00:08:18,851 --> 00:08:24,996
starts singing a song called The Ballad of the
Witch's Road. All I know is anyone who's looking

90
00:08:25,036 --> 00:08:32,346
forward to this but also trashing the Joker
for being a musical is a hypocrite. Damn! The

91
00:08:32,406 --> 00:08:37,070
trailer for Agatha all along does have some
interesting moments here. We see a witch that

92
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:42,154
looks like the wicked witch of the west from
the Wizard of Oz. We see some scary moments

93
00:08:42,235 --> 00:08:49,241
where like this witch demon chick is like crucified
on fire. It's kind of freaky looking. I don't

94
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:52,724
know what to make of Aubrey Paz's character.
She definitely looks to be like the wild card

95
00:08:52,764 --> 00:08:58,149
of the group, it seems. It'll definitely make
for some pretty solid Halloween viewing this

96
00:08:58,189 --> 00:09:05,031
spooky season. There was a line though that
I absolutely despise where Agatha tells, I

97
00:09:05,091 --> 00:09:10,433
think, Billy, the Scrawler Witch's son, she
says, time to finish the road, last one there's

98
00:09:10,473 --> 00:09:15,614
a good person. It's so fucking cheesy. Horrible
delivery, horrible writing. I hope it's not

99
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:19,775
indicative of some of the cheesiness that may
be to come and it's just kind of a one-off

100
00:09:19,895 --> 00:09:23,896
bad joke. Because otherwise, this all looks
like a lot of fun and I can't wait for it to

101
00:09:23,936 --> 00:09:28,958
come out next month on September 18th. It's
going to be a two-episode premiere. and then

102
00:09:28,978 --> 00:09:36,380
they're going to do one episode a week after
that. Blank, blank! That's so stupid. At D23,

103
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,581
Marvel also showed trailers for Captain America
Brave New World, Fantastic Four First Steps,

104
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:45,943
Daredevil Born Again, and Iron Hearts, but none
of those trailers were officially released.

105
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:50,584
I'll just kind of do a quick run through of
some of the exciting things that these trailers

106
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:56,003
showed. On the Captain America Brave New World
clip, we saw. President Thunderbolt Ross give

107
00:09:56,103 --> 00:10:02,409
a speech congratulating Sam for his help in
acquiring adamantium from the celestial Tiamat

108
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:08,335
which had sprung out of the Indian Ocean in
the Eternals movie. Oh shit! Those rumors are

109
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,557
true. Shut up!

110
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:20,519
There's just a lot of action in that trailer.
We get some lines from Sarbra, who was formerly

111
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:25,221
an Israeli superhero in the comics, but they're
making her a former Black Widow in the movie.

112
00:10:25,701 --> 00:10:30,742
We've already gotten a look at what the Red
Hulk looks like in the first trailer for Captain

113
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:35,823
America Brave New World. Sort of. We saw his
back. In this one, we actually get to see the

114
00:10:35,883 --> 00:10:40,105
front of him, Aunt Harrison Ford's face all
in red, which was really cool. He would have

115
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:45,114
made a really good Hulk back in the day when
he was younger. It's a great character design.

116
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:49,336
Yeah, it looks a lot like Harrison Ford as much
as you would want it to look like him while

117
00:10:49,376 --> 00:10:54,838
still looking like this raging monster true
to the comics. So really looking forward to

118
00:10:54,858 --> 00:10:58,700
seeing Harrison Ford Hulk out. But one of the
other really exciting moments we got from this

119
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:04,202
trailer was when President Thunderbolt Ross
asked Sam Wilson to recreate the Avengers.

120
00:11:04,722 --> 00:11:09,124
So it looks like by the end of this movie, we're
going to have the new Avengers team solidified,

121
00:11:09,184 --> 00:11:14,682
perhaps. Or maybe he's going to start his quest
to form that team. I'd be surprised if we had

122
00:11:15,082 --> 00:11:19,705
an actual solidified team by the end of this.
You might be right. I mean, Sam Wilson did

123
00:11:19,765 --> 00:11:23,488
question Thunderbolt Ross. He was like, you
destroyed the Avengers when you established

124
00:11:23,508 --> 00:11:29,471
the Accords. And Thunderbolt Ross is basically
like, eh, I had a change of heart after the

125
00:11:29,491 --> 00:11:34,094
Avengers saved the world during the events of
Endgame. So I guess that's a believable reason

126
00:11:34,134 --> 00:11:39,677
for him to essentially 180 on his position regarding
superheroes. Of course, this new team of Avengers...

127
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:44,689
seems like it would be under official government
control, so who knows what's going to happen

128
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:50,233
with the team. There was some more footage released
that I believe came from Comic-Con, although

129
00:11:50,273 --> 00:11:55,317
I think they re-showed it at the D23 event,
which was kind of a teaser of sorts for the

130
00:11:55,357 --> 00:12:00,701
Fantastic Four First Steps movie. There was
a whole lot of reveals to come out of this

131
00:12:00,741 --> 00:12:05,925
footage, but it definitely set the tone, which
is very much in keeping with this 1960s feel.

132
00:12:06,546 --> 00:12:11,748
I can definitely see why Matt Shackman got the
job after directing WandaVision, because the

133
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:16,811
way everybody acts and looks is very much in
keeping with how he directed those 60s episodes

134
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:22,755
on WandaVision. Yeah, the cinematography here
is very, very bright, very clean and very in

135
00:12:22,795 --> 00:12:29,919
keeping with this idealistic sci-fi retro 1960s
design aesthetic that looks really cool to

136
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:36,163
see on screen. Yeah, we see the Fantastic Four
suit up as astronauts. They go up into space

137
00:12:36,303 --> 00:12:40,587
and it's almost like they're part of a documentary
talking to the camera as like a promotional

138
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:44,492
piece for the general public learning about
this space mission that they're about to go

139
00:12:44,592 --> 00:12:49,557
on. Reed Richards is like, this is my buddy
Ben. He's the best pilot in the division. And

140
00:12:49,597 --> 00:12:53,801
Ben's like, yeah, best looking, which is interesting
because, you know, it's a joke, but it's ironic

141
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:58,638
that he then turns into the thing who is known
for being this hideous rock monster. And there's

142
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:04,201
a clip here that shows him as part of a dating
game show where a female contestant selects

143
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:09,644
him out of the three possible suitors. The clip
showed the fantasticar and the big reveal at

144
00:13:09,664 --> 00:13:14,586
the end was Galactus. He looks exactly like
he does in the comic books. He's this giant

145
00:13:14,626 --> 00:13:20,430
figure. You only really get to see his face,
but the scale of him is massive, similar to

146
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:26,433
the size of the celestials that we saw in Eternals.
Yeah, he's like Kaiju size, right? Right. And

147
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:31,083
he's peeking through a window. They did a great
job of capturing the look and the scale of

148
00:13:31,103 --> 00:13:37,347
the character for sure. With the square glowing
pupils? Yeah, yeah. At D23 they also showed

149
00:13:37,367 --> 00:13:41,909
a trailer for Daredevil Born Again which was
really exciting to see. We got news that the

150
00:13:41,969 --> 00:13:46,571
show is going to make its debut on Disney Plus
this spring. It looks like a direct continuation

151
00:13:46,632 --> 00:13:51,454
of the Netflix Daredevil series which is all
that the fans want, right? But there were some

152
00:13:51,494 --> 00:13:57,317
great surprises to be seen in the footage including
our first look at Hector Alaya as the White

153
00:13:57,357 --> 00:14:02,556
Tiger. His costume looked a little bit homegrown
because it looks like the premise of the show

154
00:14:02,616 --> 00:14:08,960
is that Matt represents Hector, who believes
himself to be a hero and called to fight crime

155
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:12,802
on the streets as a costume vigilante. But we
also get to see other cool characters like

156
00:14:12,882 --> 00:14:17,685
Muse, we see Bullseye, we see the Punisher Maker
return. That was really cool to see Jon Bernthal

157
00:14:17,705 --> 00:14:23,088
returning to the character. There's this great
diner scene between Matt Murdock and the Kingpin

158
00:14:23,548 --> 00:14:27,499
where Matt's telling him like basically, If
you step out of line, I'm going to be there.

159
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:32,643
And Kingpin, very imposingly, is like, who's
going to stop me? Matt Murdock or your other

160
00:14:32,683 --> 00:14:37,067
half? Yeah, that's probably one of my favorite
parts of the trailer, too. I saw that and I

161
00:14:37,087 --> 00:14:43,532
was like, oh, shit. There was another great
shot where Daredevil opens up his costume closet.

162
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:47,575
And we see like five different masks of the
Daredevil costume, including, you know, his

163
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:51,979
yellow mask. There's a white one in there and
he has like three different variations of red.

164
00:14:52,439 --> 00:14:59,541
Yeah, black one. I was like, blank, blank. Just
stop, right? I know you're the token DC guy

165
00:14:59,721 --> 00:15:06,908
in this episode, but you could also try to not
be annoying. Damn. The last footage we got

166
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:14,014
shown at D23 was from Ironheart, the upcoming
series for Disney Plus, which looks very different

167
00:15:14,054 --> 00:15:17,797
than what I thought it was going to be. I thought
largely it was going to be more like the comics

168
00:15:17,837 --> 00:15:24,422
where we see Riri at MIT building this new suit
of armor. But. we learn early on in the trailer

169
00:15:24,502 --> 00:15:29,924
that she actually gets kicked out of MIT for
skipping classes and just using the campus

170
00:15:29,944 --> 00:15:36,285
for its facilities to rebuild the armor that
she had already constructed in Wakanda in the

171
00:15:36,325 --> 00:15:40,987
Black Panther Wakanda Forever movie. Because
Shuri didn't let Riri take the suit with her

172
00:15:41,047 --> 00:15:45,708
at the end of that film. So she's basically
back to square one trying to recreate that

173
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:53,162
she gets kicked out of MIT and she ends up partnering
with a gang led by the Hood to steal resources

174
00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:59,527
and money to recreate her suit. So, it all felt
very much like set it off. I don't know if

175
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:04,230
our listeners remember that movie from the 90s
with Queen Latifah and like Jada Pinkett where

176
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:09,234
a group of girls essentially become bank robbers.
This is very much in that vein, which is something

177
00:16:09,274 --> 00:16:13,097
that I wasn't expecting. I didn't know that
it was going to be like a redemptive arc for

178
00:16:13,177 --> 00:16:17,800
Riri Williams, but it's an interesting take
for sure. The hood looks pretty cool. There's

179
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,966
definitely a supernatural element going on there.
and the rumor is that Mephisto is going to

180
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:27,268
appear in Ironheart, so it'll be interesting
to see how that supernatural aspect plays into

181
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:32,609
this more sci-fi tech angle with the Iron Man
suit. Yeah, in my opinion, the hood looked

182
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:38,151
like the most interesting thing in this trailer.
Anthony Ramos, I think, gave off the most charisma,

183
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:42,312
probably even more so than the lead Dominique
Thorne, though, you know, she looks like she'll

184
00:16:42,332 --> 00:16:46,313
do a good job as well. I have to say, I wasn't
looking forward to this, but the trailer definitely

185
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:51,267
has me intrigued. For sure. Yeah, me too. I
wasn't a big fan of Dominique Thorne in the

186
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:56,652
Black Panther Wakanda Forever movie, but she
impressed me more in this trailer. So yeah,

187
00:16:56,692 --> 00:17:00,755
definitely looking forward to it. Based on all
of this footage that we got from D23, I do

188
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:06,099
have to say that it looks like Marvel Studios
is absolutely stepping up their cinematography

189
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:10,763
for their television series. That's a great
take. Yeah, for sure. I noticed that too. But

190
00:17:10,803 --> 00:17:16,808
speaking about all the projects coming out for
Marvel that were previewed at D23, that brings

191
00:17:16,848 --> 00:17:18,069
us to our question of the week.

198
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:57,145
just a short quick headline. Deadpool and Wolverine
has surpassed one billion dollars at the worldwide

199
00:17:57,206 --> 00:18:02,949
box office. It's no surprise, I think, to anybody
who's seen the film. It is a very fun movie

200
00:18:02,969 --> 00:18:08,472
that you can listen to our review from a few
episodes ago. But I think the reason this news

201
00:18:08,512 --> 00:18:13,235
is so important is because a lot of people were
kind of down and out on the superhero genre

202
00:18:13,275 --> 00:18:18,386
as a whole. You know, you heard a lot to talk
about superhero fatigue from people and. I

203
00:18:18,406 --> 00:18:22,968
don't want to say that superhero fatigue is
over and done with, but it's clear that people

204
00:18:23,008 --> 00:18:29,172
are still excited to see quality superhero movies.
Now the first two films did not reach a billion,

205
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:34,256
is that correct? But they got close? Correct.
Okay, yeah, that's huge for a rated R film.

206
00:18:34,316 --> 00:18:39,279
I think the Joker is still the highest grossing
rated R film of all time. We'll see if Deadpool

207
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:44,430
and Wolverine can top that. Honestly, I would
be surprised if it didn't. Oh, it will. and

208
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:49,692
super proud of Marvel for bringing the box office
in general out of its slump and for bringing

209
00:18:49,772 --> 00:18:53,473
audiences back to the superhero genre. Because
we all know that DC wasn't going to be able

210
00:18:53,513 --> 00:18:58,816
to do it. I'm sorry, what? You heard me. Nobody
goes to see DC films. Just wait a couple of

211
00:18:58,836 --> 00:19:04,778
months, OK? Joker 1 made a billion dollars.
Joker, Vali-Adu could easily make a billion

212
00:19:04,818 --> 00:19:09,080
dollars as well. That would actually be fantastic,
because then the studios will see that, you

213
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:15,399
know, these movies are worth continuing. They'll
all be doing this till they're 90. That's right.

214
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:25,616
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and get into

215
00:19:25,656 --> 00:19:32,341
our main event, where we review the Marvel Television
Hulu Original Series, Hitmonkey Season 2.

216
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:54,501
Hit Monkey Season 2 is a 20th century production
on Hulu created by Josh Gordon and Will Speck

217
00:19:54,681 --> 00:20:00,745
and directed by Kevin Mellon. It stars Fred
Tataskior, Jason Sudeikis, Leslie Jones, Kristen

218
00:20:00,805 --> 00:20:07,028
Milioti and Nat Faxon. Season 1 was a surprise
hit for us, I think both of our expectations

219
00:20:07,048 --> 00:20:14,172
were surpassed. We rated Season 1 4 stars, calling
it cool, funny, violent, heartfelt and surprisingly

220
00:20:14,212 --> 00:20:19,683
complex despite its high concept premise. And
we weren't alone in being impressed by the

221
00:20:19,703 --> 00:20:24,845
show because it got a season two. And I think
season two wraps up all those qualities, except

222
00:20:24,865 --> 00:20:29,967
for maybe the comedy, because the season wasn't
very funny. But I think it was even more violent

223
00:20:30,167 --> 00:20:34,569
and more emotionally complex. Because I don't
know about you, Jonathan, but I felt fucking

224
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:39,911
devastated after a few of these episodes. And
by the time the season ended, I was kind of

225
00:20:39,951 --> 00:20:44,433
emotionally wrecked. The way the season ended
kind of stuck with me a few days after watching

226
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:49,511
it. Yeah, the way the season concluded was definitely
gut-wrenching. But I would disagree with you

227
00:20:49,531 --> 00:20:54,652
in saying that it was not very funny. I thought
it was actually very funny. Maybe not as funny

228
00:20:54,873 --> 00:21:00,134
as season one, but I was laughing pretty much
the whole time. I guess I should bring up our

229
00:21:00,214 --> 00:21:05,736
spoiler warning. If you haven't watched Hitmonkey
seasons one or two, listen no further. Go watch

230
00:21:05,756 --> 00:21:10,297
the show as long as you're of a mature age and
you don't have a weak stomach for strong violence

231
00:21:10,317 --> 00:21:16,540
and heavy themes. I liken Hitmonkey Season 2's
violence to the invincible animated series

232
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,762
on Amazon, even though I've only seen Season
1 of that show. But things got really gross

233
00:21:20,842 --> 00:21:26,044
and graphic this season. Like, Season 1 was
pretty violent, but I think the biggest standout

234
00:21:26,325 --> 00:21:31,527
holy shit death from that season was the old
gun supplier woman in the fish warehouse who

235
00:21:31,587 --> 00:21:36,309
fell on the conveyor belt and then got sawed
in half. Do you remember that? Yes, yeah. Like...

236
00:21:36,502 --> 00:21:41,444
The shock value of that kill felt pretty tame
compared to some of the shit that went down

237
00:21:41,524 --> 00:21:46,326
this season. Like, this season you had people
sliced down the middle, ripped apart, hung

238
00:21:46,386 --> 00:21:51,388
on meat hooks and burned, flattened by slow
moving vehicles, dissolved, heads were sawed

239
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:57,810
off, bodies exploded. It was insanity. Like,
over time that amount of gore does have a numbing

240
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:02,892
effect. Well, it was like body horror in a way,
especially with the trees and stuff like that.

241
00:22:03,012 --> 00:22:08,667
Mm-hmm. The violence had a unique horror. to
it, especially towards the end. Yeah, but what

242
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:13,611
disturbed me more than the violence were the
emotional challenging moments this season such

243
00:22:13,671 --> 00:22:19,395
as Haruka's death, Akiko's backstory, the Shepard's
suicide, and Hitmonkey's sacrifice at the end.

244
00:22:19,975 --> 00:22:24,418
Just like the series shows no mercy with the
violence, it showed no mercy with my heart.

245
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:29,262
Which time after time in the latter half of
the season just sank into my stomach. It was

246
00:22:29,322 --> 00:22:35,150
tragedy after tragedy after tragedy right up
until the very last shot of the season. They're

247
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:40,433
well-earned moments, but it's a dark show. By
far Marvel's darkest project that they could

248
00:22:40,554 --> 00:22:45,777
conceivably ever produce, which is one of the
reasons why I think this season was moved to

249
00:22:45,837 --> 00:22:50,701
20th century television, from Marvel television,
maybe. And interestingly, none of the other

250
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:55,624
Marvel characters from the comics, to my knowledge,
were in this season. Like the Alderman or the

251
00:22:55,644 --> 00:22:59,727
co-op members, those weren't characters from
the comics, they were original here. The only

252
00:22:59,787 --> 00:23:04,682
other Marvel character here was Lady Bullseye,
carrying over from season one. Really? I was

253
00:23:04,702 --> 00:23:08,143
going to ask you about that because I figured
that all of these characters were from the

254
00:23:08,163 --> 00:23:12,545
comics and I was like, are these, you know,
a Marvel version of the Suicide Squad in a

255
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:16,527
way? Because that's what I was thinking as I
was watching it. But I'm surprised to hear

256
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:21,409
that all of them are original. That's wow. Yeah,
the show's kind of like separating itself from

257
00:23:21,449 --> 00:23:26,851
the larger Marvel brand, it feels like even
though the show is branded as Marvel. But if

258
00:23:26,871 --> 00:23:30,832
you guys are interested in the comic book character
of Hitmonkey, you should definitely check out

259
00:23:30,912 --> 00:23:35,767
our Gleek versus Hitmonkey duel episode. The
character in the comics has oftentimes gone

260
00:23:35,787 --> 00:23:40,609
down a comedic route because the premise is
comedic, especially in the Deadpool comics

261
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:46,252
and stuff like that where we see Monkey try
to kill Wade. But the show rightfully ignores

262
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:52,135
the more silly elements of the character and
kind of goes all in on its serious approach.

263
00:23:52,355 --> 00:23:56,737
Does it? I don't know if I agree with that.
I think the show gets pretty absurd with all

264
00:23:56,777 --> 00:24:00,895
of its characters. I mean, they throw jokes
around here and there. The heaviness of the

265
00:24:00,915 --> 00:24:05,577
violence and the darkness are only slightly
offset by the fact that we're watching a show

266
00:24:05,617 --> 00:24:10,299
about a Japanese macaque wearing a black suit
and sunglasses. I think a better balance of

267
00:24:10,339 --> 00:24:13,920
comedy and tragedy could have been struck if
the jokes had been better. Like, I think a

268
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:18,242
lot of the lines here could and should have
probably been workshopped. Which is especially

269
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:21,504
surprising since you have some comedic geniuses
on the show like Jason

270
00:24:25,942 --> 00:24:31,766
Like, I wonder how they were OK with making
lame and even dated jokes about Greek yogurt,

271
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:37,450
Annie Lennox is walking on broken glass or being
a duo like Pamela Anderson in that red swimsuit.

272
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:43,434
Like, I have no idea. I still chuckled at those
bits. I don't know. I didn't think it was terribly

273
00:24:43,474 --> 00:24:47,657
unfunny. I did think it was interesting that
Jason Sudeikis was a consulting producer on

274
00:24:47,697 --> 00:24:51,820
this show apparently according to the credits.
I wonder how much of that had to do with his

275
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:56,203
line specifically. Yeah, he got the top credit.
at the end of every episode, which I thought

276
00:24:56,223 --> 00:25:00,587
was pretty neat. But yeah, I think this season
could have been even more palatable with better

277
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:06,593
jokes. But another reason that I think that
season two felt much more visceral than season

278
00:25:06,813 --> 00:25:10,777
one was due to the fact that the animation was
better. Like one of our biggest complaints

279
00:25:10,797 --> 00:25:16,482
about season one was that the animation felt
largely like a step up from storyboards with

280
00:25:16,603 --> 00:25:22,782
low frame rates, sometimes even missing action
scenes. And that was likely due to Marvel television's

281
00:25:22,822 --> 00:25:27,144
transition under the Marvel Studios umbrella
in the middle of production, which was something

282
00:25:27,184 --> 00:25:33,005
that cancelled a lot of Marvel's planned shows
except for Modoc and Hitmonkey. But you could

283
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:37,246
tell the animators didn't have any such obstacle
with season 2 because the frame rate was better,

284
00:25:37,466 --> 00:25:42,168
you know, you had more subtle facial and body
motions that helped sell the characters' emotional

285
00:25:42,228 --> 00:25:47,349
states, and you had beautifully rendered environments,
like a lot of them were computer-generated

286
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:52,240
environments. It was really nice to see the
animators be able to execute more fully on

287
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,883
their vision this go around. Yeah, I don't remember
hating the animation of season one. I actually

288
00:25:56,903 --> 00:26:01,706
kind of liked the low budget quality because
it made it feel like Grindhouse. But I also

289
00:26:01,927 --> 00:26:07,630
really enjoyed the animation for this season.
Honestly, it got me kind of jealous how good

290
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:12,033
the animation was, especially coming off of
something like My Adventures with Superman,

291
00:26:12,194 --> 00:26:17,617
which doesn't have bad animation. But when you
compare to the quality of Hit Monkey, you could

292
00:26:17,657 --> 00:26:23,535
definitely tell that the artists spent much
more time with this. I think my adventures

293
00:26:23,555 --> 00:26:27,779
with Superman has fine animation. I would be
more embarrassed about the tomorrow verse,

294
00:26:27,899 --> 00:26:33,043
though. Oh, yeah, especially that. I wasn't
even thinking about that because I was trying

295
00:26:33,064 --> 00:26:38,768
to block it. But yeah, I would agree. I thought
another improvement over season 1 was the music.

296
00:26:38,788 --> 00:26:42,231
And I'm not talking about the original score
because that's always been incredible, but

297
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:47,275
season 2 featured a lot more licensed music
with some phenomenal choices like Bed of Nails

298
00:26:47,395 --> 00:26:53,821
by Patrick Austin, What You Came For by Wallio,
True Killer by The Sneaks, and one in particular

299
00:26:53,841 --> 00:26:59,406
that really stuck with me was the beautifully
haunting Japanese song from the end of episode

300
00:26:59,446 --> 00:27:05,478
7 when Haruka died called Good Morning by an
artist named Yuki. And I have to give a shout

301
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:09,101
out to Reddit for coming through on that one
because that was a really hard song to find.

302
00:27:09,621 --> 00:27:15,886
And I thought it perfectly captured the devastating
emotions I was feeling when that episode came

303
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:20,829
to a close. And I listen to it now and it still
makes me sad. So whoever picked the music for

304
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:25,653
the season did fantastic. Yes, the soundtrack
was amazing. I was like, who put this together?

305
00:27:25,793 --> 00:27:31,117
Quentin Tarantino? Because it is perfection.
Like, I'm going to need that list of songs

306
00:27:31,137 --> 00:27:35,368
that you have. I have a Spotify link I can send
to you, and I'll probably post it in the show

307
00:27:35,388 --> 00:27:40,130
notes if people are curious. Nice, yes please,
do that. Let's go ahead and move into the character

308
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:45,894
breakdown, starting with Hitmonkey who is voiced
by Fred Tataskior. Just like season 1, I'm

309
00:27:45,994 --> 00:27:51,497
surprised Hitmonkey was not voiced by an actual
monkey, because Fred Tataskior is a genius

310
00:27:51,657 --> 00:27:56,380
voice actor who has also done the voice of the
Hulk, he does the voice of Devil Dinosaur in

311
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:02,052
Moongirl and Devil Dinosaur on Disney+. He is
the best voice actor with animalistic sounds.

312
00:28:02,612 --> 00:28:07,335
Yeah, I loved the noises that Hitmonkey made
and it was like a good juxtaposition for how

313
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:12,938
crass Bryce was. Yeah, and there was real emotion
behind his sounds too. Like you don't really

314
00:28:13,058 --> 00:28:17,201
need subtitles for the Hitmonkey character,
although we did get them in one scene. But

315
00:28:17,261 --> 00:28:22,204
other than that, you know exactly what he's
saying. Exactly, yeah. Now Hitmonkey's arc

316
00:28:22,384 --> 00:28:28,620
was difficult and tragic this season. Carrying
over from season 1, he was a skilled assassin

317
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:33,523
who never wanted to kill, but always found himself
in situations where he must, like some kind

318
00:28:33,563 --> 00:28:39,087
of cruel fate. At the start of this season,
he's lost, unhappy, and feels like the killing

319
00:28:39,127 --> 00:28:44,451
is taking a psychological toll on him. And what
he really longs for is a family who can relate

320
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:49,514
to what he's going through, and he finds that
in the assassin's cooperative. He strives to

321
00:28:49,554 --> 00:28:54,998
be one of them, drawn to their family dynamic
and their goal of ending violence. and he relates

322
00:28:55,018 --> 00:29:02,084
to Boon and his values. And by showing Hitmonkey
his origin as a lab experiment, Boon convinces

323
00:29:02,124 --> 00:29:07,808
Hitmonkey that he's been cursed by mankind's
wickedness, and that humanity has always been

324
00:29:08,109 --> 00:29:13,693
only about death. And it shakes Hitmonkey to
the core, especially seeing how his actions

325
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:19,578
affected the person he cared the most about,
Akiko, who transformed herself into Lady Bullseye.

326
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:26,234
In the very end, it seemed like he gave into
his despair. thinking about his so-called curse

327
00:29:26,434 --> 00:29:33,757
as he sacrificed himself to kill her. It was
a heroic final action rooted in misery and

328
00:29:33,937 --> 00:29:39,339
even when he came back as a ghost tethered to
Bryce, he didn't look happy. And I think that

329
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:44,821
was the real tragedy that stuck with me. And
I'm really looking forward to seeing what they

330
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:50,196
do with Hitmonkey if there is a season 3. Oh,
good gosh, please let there be a season three.

331
00:29:50,216 --> 00:29:54,621
I mean, you can't end it with that shot. That
would be just so tragic. Yeah, I hope that

332
00:29:54,661 --> 00:29:58,945
this show really finds its audience in the same
way that season one did and that they announce

333
00:29:58,985 --> 00:30:04,591
a season three for Hitmonkey because it needs
to happen for sure. I did think the revelation

334
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:10,806
that he was an experimental monkey kind of came
out of nowhere in a way for this show. Yeah,

335
00:30:10,826 --> 00:30:16,510
that was something not from the comics. In the
comics, he was just this really astute monkey

336
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:21,473
who was able to pick up the assassin's killing
methods really easily. But here it was almost

337
00:30:21,493 --> 00:30:27,157
like they gave him some kind of genetic enhancement
superpower or something like that. Right. Yeah,

338
00:30:27,298 --> 00:30:31,821
I didn't care for it. And I think it came a
little bit too late. Maybe if it had come earlier

339
00:30:31,901 --> 00:30:36,464
or maybe even in the first season, it would
have been more palatable. But I didn't know

340
00:30:36,484 --> 00:30:41,563
if I needed that twist here. Yeah, it did come
late so they weren't really able to explore

341
00:30:41,723 --> 00:30:46,546
that origin, which is again why we need a season
3. Yeah, for sure. Let's go ahead and move

342
00:30:46,606 --> 00:30:52,430
on to Bryce Fowler, who was voiced by Jason
Sudeikis. I was a little mixed on Bryce this

343
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:58,474
season because the guy is never consistent,
whether it be his humor or his motivations.

344
00:30:58,514 --> 00:31:03,757
At times it seems like he's this plucky, wisecracking
badass. At other times he's this depressed,

345
00:31:03,857 --> 00:31:10,078
selfish asshole. And while I'd like to say that
just makes him a multifaceted character, what

346
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:15,562
I really want is to just see Bryce pick a lane,
I guess. Well, he has to exist in multiple

347
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:20,967
lanes in a way because Monkey can't really.
You know, in a way, Bryce is the main character

348
00:31:21,007 --> 00:31:26,611
of the show. Yeah, and you know, we may see
him kind of pick a lane in this season as he

349
00:31:26,652 --> 00:31:31,095
deals with the guilt over the fact that the
devil claimed Hitmonkey's soul due to his own

350
00:31:31,215 --> 00:31:35,639
selfish deals to get out of hell. Again, I hope
we... get to see the fallout of that in season

351
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:41,802
3. The culmination of Bryce's character growth
ever since season 1 came at the end of this

352
00:31:41,822 --> 00:31:47,105
season when he tried to console Hitmonkey about
his lost family in the co-op, telling him that

353
00:31:47,245 --> 00:31:53,148
Boon was wrong and that humanity isn't all about
death, it's about living. And right after that

354
00:31:53,188 --> 00:31:59,272
he used himself as a human shield to save his
daughter Iris from Akiko, knowing that turning

355
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:04,783
corporeal would doom him to hell for all eternity.
And this was on top of this season long arc

356
00:32:04,903 --> 00:32:09,625
where he tried to get to know Iris, at first
trying to buy her off, and then apologizing

357
00:32:09,665 --> 00:32:14,407
and bonding with her, helping her find herself
in this crazy mercenary world he was involved

358
00:32:14,467 --> 00:32:20,230
in, and then actually forming a truly caring
relationship by the end. In a way, both Bryce

359
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:25,212
and Hitmonkey's stories are all about finding
their family. The only difference is that Bryce

360
00:32:25,292 --> 00:32:31,226
found his this season, whereas Hitmonkey tragically
did not. Well, Hitmonkey took responsibility

361
00:32:31,426 --> 00:32:36,988
in a way for destroying his family from season
one. I really liked Bryce this season. I really

362
00:32:37,028 --> 00:32:42,529
liked him last season as well. Yeah, the character
is inconsistent, but I loved what they did

363
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:47,771
with him here, how he could go in and out of
his corporeal form with that timer on his hand.

364
00:32:48,031 --> 00:32:53,633
It was a great gimmick that I thought they used
to really good effect in this season. I liked

365
00:32:53,673 --> 00:32:59,660
his telekinesis abilities this season. It makes
you think that DC should make Deadman even

366
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:05,503
cooler by giving him telekinesis. Yeah, just
make him like more able to affect the physical

367
00:33:05,543 --> 00:33:11,827
world in a way. Yeah, that would be cool. Let's
go to move on to Officer Haruka, who was voiced

368
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:16,870
by Ali Mackie, who gives a great performance
again. Her character's always the most morally

369
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:22,734
good character in the show, serving as a beacon
to kind of guide Hitmonkey and Bryce. And because

370
00:33:22,754 --> 00:33:27,375
of that, it was pretty interesting this season
that Haruka's journey involved her being tempted

371
00:33:27,415 --> 00:33:32,937
by the power of evil through the Bonsai Master
Sword. And she gave into temptation a few times,

372
00:33:33,517 --> 00:33:39,480
ultimately though choosing to reject it and
thereby dying at the hands of her friend rather

373
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,421
than the other way around. Super sad. But it
was neat that her character drove a lot of

374
00:33:44,441 --> 00:33:48,785
the plot. this time around. You know, she first
introduced the alderman sword to Hitmonkey

375
00:33:48,805 --> 00:33:53,889
and Bryce, and then she was the one that discovered
the truth about the co-op and decided to steal

376
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:59,654
back the sword. She really was a great character
with tremendous buildup over the two seasons,

377
00:33:59,754 --> 00:34:06,559
which is definitely what made her death so tragic
and the emotion around it so earned. Oh yeah,

378
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,523
and especially how she was talking about going
back to her father's fishing village and retiring

379
00:34:11,543 --> 00:34:18,120
there only to be buried at sea. Poetry, it was
poetry. That whole scene I was like, oh, okay,

380
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,624
someone's gonna die here. I didn't actually
think it was gonna be Haruka. So yeah, it was

381
00:34:22,644 --> 00:34:27,888
definitely surprising when it was. Speaking
of that, let's move on to Akiko Yokohama voiced

382
00:34:27,908 --> 00:34:33,472
by Olivia Munn. Holy shit, man. I take back
everything I said from our season one review

383
00:34:33,673 --> 00:34:38,436
about how it didn't make sense for Akiko to
become Lady Bullseye and how they ruined her

384
00:34:38,556 --> 00:34:43,772
arc when she put on the mask. Here she admits
that she took on the lady bullseye mantle because

385
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:47,836
she didn't think she could be strong or vicious
enough on her own, which was totally valid

386
00:34:47,896 --> 00:34:53,080
reasoning. I was like, okay, that makes sense.
From season one, we saw her as a speechwriter

387
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:58,525
for her uncle's campaign back in Tokyo and she
served as the surrogate family for Hitmonkey.

388
00:34:59,005 --> 00:35:03,709
But what we didn't see was this whole devastating
backstory involving the loss of her family

389
00:35:03,929 --> 00:35:08,713
and being bullied and committed to a sanitarium.
That whole scene was really fucking heavy.

390
00:35:09,206 --> 00:35:14,148
And the animation for that sequence was just
heart-wrenching. Like when she cried out in

391
00:35:14,168 --> 00:35:19,550
the sanitarium and her sadness was depicted
as layers and layers of grief within herself,

392
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:25,613
it was just a really effective moment at showing
how broken and devastated she is deep down.

393
00:35:26,093 --> 00:35:31,035
And it was in that emotional flashback where
you really sympathized with her, with what

394
00:35:31,075 --> 00:35:35,237
she had gone through. But the thing is they
followed that immediately with a scene of her

395
00:35:35,337 --> 00:35:41,316
sawing a dude's head off in a bathtub. And the
contrast of those two scenes made it one of

396
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:46,200
the most challenging moments for me to process
in this season. It was like the floor just

397
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:52,404
dropped out from under me and it completely
sold Akiko's complexity and her personal transformation

398
00:35:52,524 --> 00:35:56,427
into Lady Bullseye. So yeah, I take back everything
I said. I thought this whole thing was brilliant

399
00:35:56,627 --> 00:36:02,131
with Akiko. Absolutely. It was also interesting
to see how Lady Bullseye as a ghost was tied

400
00:36:02,171 --> 00:36:09,015
to Akiko and served as her mentor. Yeah. leading
her toward her most violent tendencies. But

401
00:36:09,175 --> 00:36:15,098
even then, Akiko fucking killed Lady Bullseye's
ghost right after killing Karuka, so she just

402
00:36:15,138 --> 00:36:20,200
went off the deep end and was really beyond
redemption as much as Hitmonkey would have

403
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:25,523
wished otherwise. Yeah, I would agree. I just
think it was interesting how she was sort of

404
00:36:25,743 --> 00:36:31,202
like Hitmonkey in a way. The fact that she had
this ghost spirit who followed her. And it

405
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:35,984
was this somewhat peaceful character who became
very violent. She just kind of went the other

406
00:36:36,024 --> 00:36:40,527
direction with it. Right. There's parallels
there. The last character I want to talk about

407
00:36:40,807 --> 00:36:45,689
is Boon, who was the leader of the co-op and
the main villain for the season, who was voiced

408
00:36:45,729 --> 00:36:52,413
by Nat Faxon. I did not recognize Nat Faxon's
voice. It was so hilarious and how douchey

409
00:36:52,453 --> 00:36:56,956
it was. And I think it was pretty clear from
the get go that Boon was just too douchey to

410
00:36:57,036 --> 00:37:02,254
stay good. It was probably pretty obvious that
he was going to turn evil. But Boon's genocidal

411
00:37:02,295 --> 00:37:06,658
twist was, I think, a welcome one. If only that
it meant that you'd see him meet his end by

412
00:37:06,678 --> 00:37:11,722
the hands of Hitmonkey. Yeah, I'm like even
more impressed now that you tell me that these

413
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:17,306
characters were original because the show writers
had to have a pretty great imagination for

414
00:37:17,346 --> 00:37:22,710
coming up with some of these characters like
Boon and the other members of the Assassin's

415
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:29,398
Co-op. Like freaking boy band super villains?
Hilarious. Totally out of left field, but adds

416
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:34,740
unique depth to this character, right? Yeah.
You know, despite Boon's extreme methods by

417
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:40,141
the end, the way he described his dream of a
perfect utopia, one without violence, full

418
00:37:40,161 --> 00:37:45,803
of plants and animals, like an Eden for the
group, his philosophical words were enticing

419
00:37:45,843 --> 00:37:50,544
enough to put Hitmonkey under his spell for
a time. You know, he made Hitmonkey question

420
00:37:50,705 --> 00:37:55,919
everything, from his friendships to the nature
of humanity. he manipulated him like some kind

421
00:37:55,939 --> 00:38:01,222
of charismatic cult leader, even without using
his powers of telepathy and mind control. And

422
00:38:01,262 --> 00:38:07,747
in my book, that made him a fucking solid villain.
Oh yeah, no question. He was a great villain.

423
00:38:08,247 --> 00:38:13,511
Some of the best villains are sympathetic or
you understand the reasoning behind what they're

424
00:38:13,551 --> 00:38:17,734
doing. And Boon was definitely one of those
characters. Like who doesn't want to get rid

425
00:38:17,794 --> 00:38:22,077
of evil in the world? Although you would think,
you know, if he could control minds, if his

426
00:38:22,117 --> 00:38:27,512
power was telepathy, Wouldn't he be a little
bit more capable in getting the alderman to

427
00:38:27,552 --> 00:38:31,695
give him the relics? That was something I was
wondering. Yeah, it's very true. All he really

428
00:38:31,735 --> 00:38:37,119
had to do was encounter them to control them.
Like especially with the third eye guy, like

429
00:38:37,499 --> 00:38:42,683
why did they have a history of difficulty with
him? Or with the shepherd or the call or any

430
00:38:42,723 --> 00:38:45,965
of them. Any one of them could have been mind
controlled because none of them really had

431
00:38:46,165 --> 00:38:51,048
psychic powers. Or a defense against psychic
powers. Right. That was just one of the very

432
00:38:51,068 --> 00:38:53,587
few plot holes I spotted throughout the course
of the show.

440
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:52,409
But speaking of the plot, let's go ahead and
get into our episode highlights. Episode 1

441
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:57,833
was called Return to Sender. In a flashback,
Bryce descends into Hell, where he makes a

442
00:39:57,873 --> 00:40:03,417
deal with Mephisto to return as a ghost to assist
Hitmonkey in sending souls to Hell. In the

443
00:40:03,477 --> 00:40:09,081
present, the duo travel to New York City and
sign up with Eunice Jones, a mercenary agent

444
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:11,262
who sets them up in Bryce's old apartment.

445
00:40:16,798 --> 00:40:22,200
which she smuggled out of Tokyo after a demonic
figure killed all of her fellow officers looking

446
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:27,002
for it. They visit a rare weapons dealer who
identifies the sword as an ancient mythical

447
00:40:27,022 --> 00:40:32,744
weapon and warns them not to wield it to avoid
being possessed by it. While Hitmonkey is out

448
00:40:32,804 --> 00:40:38,447
on a hit, which turns out to be a setup, Haruka
is chased by a demonic tiger through the city.

449
00:40:38,927 --> 00:40:44,069
She wields the sword in order to kill the cat,
temporarily transforming into a supernatural

450
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:51,194
As they ponder what happened, Bryce observes
his daughter Iris from afar. I have to say

451
00:40:51,254 --> 00:40:56,738
that I thought Keith David made an awesome Mephisto
or devil. Whatever. I don't know if this was

452
00:40:56,778 --> 00:41:01,982
Mephisto. I like to think that it is, but Keith
David was spot on with that voice. Oh, absolutely.

453
00:41:02,022 --> 00:41:07,826
Keith David is a fantastic, not just voice actor,
but actor. And, you know, he has a singular

454
00:41:07,866 --> 00:41:13,110
voice that is perfection when it comes to characters
like this, because it was really spooky. He's

455
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:18,313
also going to be voicing Darkseid in the Kite
Man Hell Yeah television series. And I'm sure

456
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:22,176
he's going to kill it. You know, it's going
to be good. Did you realize that the tiger

457
00:41:22,216 --> 00:41:28,641
who was chasing Haruka was the weapons dealers
cat that was transformed by the shepherd? I

458
00:41:28,681 --> 00:41:34,505
did not. That makes sense now. Episode two was
Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. Looking to learn

459
00:41:34,565 --> 00:41:39,968
who ordered the phony hit, Bryce, Hitmonkey
and Haruka track down the vetter at a local

460
00:41:40,008 --> 00:41:45,251
library who directs them to Charles Lehigh of
the Aldermen before being killed by assassins

461
00:41:45,551 --> 00:41:51,214
that Haruka in turn kills with her sword. The
group sneaks into an event at Lehigh's estate

462
00:41:51,314 --> 00:41:56,696
where his necklace charm recognizes Haruka's
sword. He turns into a shrieking monster known

463
00:41:56,776 --> 00:42:02,859
as The Call, but is ripped in half by a mysterious
young girl named Dot who steals the charm necklace.

464
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:07,841
Hitmonkey takes Bryce to visit the restaurant
Iris serves at, but she rejects anything to

465
00:42:07,881 --> 00:42:12,417
do with her dad. When the pair return to the
apartment, they find Haruka transformed and

466
00:42:12,457 --> 00:42:17,741
addicted to the sword's power. Meanwhile, at
a secret meeting of the three remaining aldermen,

467
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:24,887
the ogre vows to take care of Hitmonkey and
Haruka. One of the very few plot holes was

468
00:42:25,188 --> 00:42:30,272
regarding the librarian better. I'm not sure
why she died, why they killed her. I'm guessing

469
00:42:30,312 --> 00:42:35,176
that since Hitmonkey and Bryce survived the
bomb attack from the first episode, it was

470
00:42:35,236 --> 00:42:39,639
likely that the aldermen knew. that they would
investigate the vetter, which is why they tried

471
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:43,742
to kill her. Yeah, I think they were just tying
up loose ends. It's possible that they were

472
00:42:43,782 --> 00:42:48,746
staked out at the library waiting for Hitmonkey
to show up because we know that the reason

473
00:42:48,886 --> 00:42:53,589
the librarian set up the fake hit was because
they tortured her and made her break her code.

474
00:42:54,009 --> 00:42:59,333
So I don't know if it's quite a plot hole. Yeah,
I don't think it is. Episode 3 was called The

475
00:42:59,373 --> 00:43:04,416
Rope. The ogre, who is a big giant, snatches
Haruka out of their apartment and Hitmonkey

476
00:43:04,436 --> 00:43:09,715
and Bryce chase him across the city. A group
known as the Assassin's Cooperative assists

477
00:43:09,775 --> 00:43:14,798
in rescuing Haruka as Hitmonkey goes inside
the Giant's head to kill him before passing

478
00:43:14,898 --> 00:43:20,581
out. Hitmonkey wakes up in the co-op's lair
where he meets its members, Boon, Slyke, Amara,

479
00:43:20,721 --> 00:43:26,404
Double Tap, and Dot. They explain to him how
an ancient relic was divided into eight weapons

480
00:43:26,484 --> 00:43:31,882
wielded by the Aldermen to rule the world from
the shadows. They ask Hitmonkey to join their

481
00:43:31,922 --> 00:43:37,886
cause of obtaining and reforging the weapons
to restore the relic to heal the world. Contemplating

482
00:43:38,026 --> 00:43:42,769
joining the co-op family, Hitmonkey tries to
take Bryce to the restaurant to visit Iris,

483
00:43:42,909 --> 00:43:48,572
but they accidentally get her fired. Upset,
Bryce makes another deal with Mephisto for

484
00:43:48,612 --> 00:43:54,335
a physical form, however it comes with a 48
hour time limit. Meanwhile, Akiko shows up

485
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:59,999
in New York City as Lady Bullseye. I think this
was my favorite episode. I really, really liked

486
00:44:00,059 --> 00:44:05,423
the introduction of the Assassin's Co-op, but
also the backstory of the aldermen. I thought

487
00:44:05,443 --> 00:44:10,348
that was really well done. Yeah. There was just
a lot to like. The whole second deal that Bryce

488
00:44:10,408 --> 00:44:15,492
made with Mephisto you knew was going to end
in tragedy and they totally set that up perfectly.

489
00:44:15,913 --> 00:44:20,677
It was just really well written. For sure. Yeah,
and this episode had great action too. That

490
00:44:20,717 --> 00:44:24,800
fight against the ogre. Yes. That was really
well done with cool ideas. The fact that they

491
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:30,284
actually went into. ogre's head and started
shooting his brain from inside his body. That

492
00:44:30,304 --> 00:44:34,065
was pretty crazy. Yeah, it's the kind of action
that I was really looking forward to with this

493
00:44:34,106 --> 00:44:39,048
season. Just seeing monkey swing through New
York almost like Spider-Man. And yeah, this

494
00:44:39,068 --> 00:44:43,210
was definitely one of my favorite action scenes
from the whole season. Episode four was called

495
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:49,333
Never Too Late. Bryce visits Iris at her apartment
to apologize for abandoning their family, but

496
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:55,201
she rejects him. Haruka traces the Alderman
financials to a hedge fund managed by the third

497
00:44:55,441 --> 00:45:01,445
eye wielder, Yanis Kalamaris. She, Hitmonkey,
and Bryce try to fight Yanis, but are unable

498
00:45:01,485 --> 00:45:06,728
to overcome his future sight, and they are saved
by the co-op who chastises them for almost

499
00:45:06,768 --> 00:45:12,512
getting killed. Bryce reconnects with a former
associate called Snail, who can slow time and

500
00:45:12,552 --> 00:45:17,991
give them a chance against the third eye. Meanwhile...
Akiko tries to find Hitmonkey through his old

501
00:45:18,031 --> 00:45:23,034
associates and kills one with the help of the
original Lady Bullseye's ghost who was following

502
00:45:23,074 --> 00:45:29,077
her. Hitmonkey, Bryce, and Haruka catch up with
the co-op at Yenis' private jet and with Snail's

503
00:45:29,117 --> 00:45:34,440
help they defeat him. Bryce visits Iris again
to apologize and this time she gives him a

504
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:41,064
chance. Meanwhile, in Hell, Mephisto foreshadows
that his army is about to grow. Now is the

505
00:45:41,104 --> 00:45:46,170
snail an original character as well? Correct,
yeah. I liked the snail here. He was voiced

506
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:51,312
by Jim Gaffigan. He had a pretty cool, if not
gross power set where he gets slow time. But

507
00:45:51,372 --> 00:45:56,753
people who were in contact with his saliva were
able to exist outside of the time distortion

508
00:45:56,793 --> 00:46:02,855
effect. Well, it wasn't his saliva. It was his
mucus, his snot. Yeah, that's right. You're

509
00:46:02,875 --> 00:46:08,997
right. He was definitely hocking up loogies.
He wasn't just spitting. Right. Yeah. I liked

510
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:13,939
the snail. I thought the nicknames. and the
grab-assing between Bryce and him were pretty

511
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:18,241
funny. Like Snail called Bryce taint because
he's somewhere between a dick and an asshole.

512
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:22,363
And then he like sack tap him, you know, and
the Bryce would like call him like old chub

513
00:46:22,403 --> 00:46:26,745
and try to titty twist him. He's like, let me
at those little pickles. It's like, what the

514
00:46:26,865 --> 00:46:31,867
fuck is going on here? They just had this hilarious
relationship. Yeah, I thought he was going

515
00:46:31,887 --> 00:46:36,069
to reappear in the final episode. I was kind
of sad that he didn't, but they also made really

516
00:46:36,089 --> 00:46:41,024
good use of him in this episode. Yeah, it was
cool to see Bryce taking on the third eye with

517
00:46:41,044 --> 00:46:45,709
that slow motion effect. It's rare that you
see Bryce kick ass in this series, because

518
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:51,574
usually that's left to Hitmonkey. But when you
see Bryce be a badass, you remember exactly

519
00:46:51,734 --> 00:46:56,919
why he's a good mentor for Hitmonkey. Yeah,
you remember that he is an accomplished assassin.

520
00:46:57,259 --> 00:47:03,625
Yeah. Episode 5 is called Akiko. In a flashback
to Akiko's childhood, we see her family die

521
00:47:03,685 --> 00:47:08,343
in a fire. She is placed in a boarding school
by her uncle Shinji Yokohama, where she is

522
00:47:08,403 --> 00:47:13,365
bullied relentlessly and nearly drowned. She
lashes out and is placed in a psychiatric ward

523
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:19,408
before her uncle comes to raise her into a successful
writer. In the present, Bryce gets Iris a job

524
00:47:19,448 --> 00:47:24,130
with Eunice as a murder crime scene cleaner,
where she learns under another cleaner named

525
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:30,412
Buddy. Hitmonkey bonds with the co-op and visits
Eunice to quit as a mercenary but is ambushed

526
00:47:30,492 --> 00:47:35,815
by Eikiko, who falls off a building during their
fight. Hitmonkey takes her to the co-op for

527
00:47:35,855 --> 00:47:41,098
medical care, where Boon tells him that the
Akiko he knew is gone, and that his brother

528
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:47,743
Colt also succumbed to anger and killing. Unable
to end Akiko's life, Hitmonkey sets her free.

529
00:47:48,183 --> 00:47:54,688
Meanwhile, the Shepard sends a mutated pigeon
after the co-op. I totally thought Akiko initially

530
00:47:54,768 --> 00:47:58,450
died upon her fall. I was like, whoa, really?
That's how they're going to wrap up the Lady

531
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:02,093
Bullseye story? Obviously they didn't do it
that way, but it was kind of foreshadowing

532
00:48:02,133 --> 00:48:07,519
her eventual death. in the very last episode.
Yeah, through the fall maybe. But what it really

533
00:48:07,579 --> 00:48:15,101
did was give Hitmonkey an opportunity to end
her life before things got too severe. He was

534
00:48:15,141 --> 00:48:19,382
contemplating suffocating her with a pillow
while she was recovering in the hospital bed

535
00:48:19,562 --> 00:48:23,423
at the co-op's lair. But he didn't do it. Like
we all knew that he should have done it, but

536
00:48:23,463 --> 00:48:28,345
he just cared for her too much. And he ended
up undoing her handcuffs so that she can leave

537
00:48:28,385 --> 00:48:33,074
when she wakes up. But it really turned out
to be a big mistake. Yeah, huge, which is one

538
00:48:33,094 --> 00:48:37,458
of the reasons why I think he decided to take
responsibility in killing Akiko in the final

539
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:42,683
episode in the way that he did. What did you
think about Iris? I thought it was hilarious

540
00:48:42,723 --> 00:48:48,228
how she turned out to be really a chip off the
old block, you know, getting into the whole

541
00:48:48,448 --> 00:48:54,308
mercenary community. I thought the relationship
that developed between her and Bryce felt pretty

542
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:59,992
organic. It was fast, but it didn't feel too
fast just because of how open and honest Bryce

543
00:49:00,072 --> 00:49:04,334
was with his feelings towards her right off
the bat at the beginning of the season. And

544
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:09,117
it was kind of funny to see that, you know,
for however much she had hated her father,

545
00:49:09,497 --> 00:49:15,761
she ended up being more like him than she probably
realized. And more than he wanted her to. Yeah.

546
00:49:16,338 --> 00:49:22,059
Absolutely. And I love by the end how they formed
this bond between a father and daughter that

547
00:49:22,219 --> 00:49:29,741
felt real and felt pure in a way, and how good
it was for both of them and how Bryce was even

548
00:49:29,781 --> 00:49:34,703
willing to sacrifice himself for his daughter,
which is, you know, what any father should

549
00:49:34,743 --> 00:49:41,185
do. It was a truly redemptive arc for him. Yeah,
like I maybe wanted to be annoyed by Iris at

550
00:49:41,205 --> 00:49:45,150
the start of the season, but the relationship
between her and Bryce was just too good. and

551
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:50,414
she was pretty funny too. She was actually voiced
by Kristen Milioti, who is going to be playing

552
00:49:50,614 --> 00:49:56,979
Carmine Falcone's daughter in the upcoming Penguin
series. Oh really? Okay. I didn't know that.

553
00:49:57,519 --> 00:50:02,743
Episode 6 was called The Estate. The pigeon
gives an invitation to Hitmonkey and the co-op

554
00:50:02,823 --> 00:50:07,767
to join the shepherd for dinner at his estate
in the desert. As they travel there via jet,

555
00:50:08,048 --> 00:50:13,039
Iris and Eunice throw a retirement party for
Buddy. Suspecting a trap at the estate, Bryce

556
00:50:13,059 --> 00:50:17,721
volunteers to scout the situation and he learns
at dinner with the Shepard that the alderman

557
00:50:17,821 --> 00:50:22,584
initially wanted to use the relics to heal the
world just like the assassin's co-op, before

558
00:50:22,624 --> 00:50:28,047
shooting himself and passing his staff to his
wife. She uses mutated scorpions and spiders

559
00:50:28,107 --> 00:50:33,530
to attack the co-op. During the fight, Haruka
and Double Tap seek shelter in a cave where

560
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:38,312
she realizes via his thermal vision goggles
that he was the figure who shot up her precinct

561
00:50:38,352 --> 00:50:44,080
in Tokyo looking for the sword. The Shepard
mutates Hitmonkey into a giant gorilla, but

562
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:49,344
with Boon's help, he overcomes his mental control
and kills the Shepard, getting the last of

563
00:50:49,364 --> 00:50:54,828
the relics. Back at the co-op's lair, Haruka
reveals to Bryce the group's sinister intentions

564
00:50:55,228 --> 00:51:00,332
and they steal Bonsai's master sword, escaping
with Eunice to her vacation home in Montauk.

565
00:51:00,592 --> 00:51:05,816
What did you think of the reveal that Double
Tap was really the monster-like figure that

566
00:51:05,856 --> 00:51:10,039
killed all of the police officers in Tokyo?
I thought it was a little bit misleading because

567
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:16,425
in the flashback, the demonic figure was largely
just walking menacingly toward Haruka as other

568
00:51:16,465 --> 00:51:22,210
mercenaries were doing all the shooting. So
it means that Double Tap hired a hit squad

569
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:27,494
to go after the sword with him. And from what
we learn about the character later on, it seems

570
00:51:27,534 --> 00:51:31,738
more like Double Tap is not really the guy who's
inclined to work with a lot of other gunmen.

571
00:51:32,198 --> 00:51:37,026
Right, exactly. Like for all the talk he was
giving about the team only needing one gunman

572
00:51:37,226 --> 00:51:42,151
and considering how skilled he was with all
of his weapons, I thought that felt very out

573
00:51:42,171 --> 00:51:47,675
of character and very out of left field. Yeah,
it was a good twist but the way they animated

574
00:51:47,715 --> 00:51:52,159
it and set it up wasn't as successful as it
should have been. I haven't gotten your thoughts

575
00:51:52,219 --> 00:51:56,903
on Eunice yet. What did you think of Leslie
Jones as Eunice? I loved Eunice. I love Leslie

576
00:51:56,943 --> 00:52:01,907
Jones in general. I think she is hilarious.
I thought this was perfect casting for her.

577
00:52:02,388 --> 00:52:08,300
I thought all of her It was just a lot of fun.
I think she's a great character addition to

578
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:14,064
Hit Monkey's cast of allies. Yeah, for sure.
I thought Leslie Jones gave the best delivery.

579
00:52:14,184 --> 00:52:18,807
Like, I remember in this episode when she told
Hit Monkey to get out of here with your clown

580
00:52:18,907 --> 00:52:23,850
ass friends, get into your clown ass car, and
go to your clown convention. Because guess

581
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:30,615
what? Your ass is a fucking clown. I died. She's
so good at lines like that. Yeah, it's like

582
00:52:30,655 --> 00:52:35,998
Leslie Jones never plays characters other than
Leslie Jones. She's always playing herself,

583
00:52:36,038 --> 00:52:41,782
but it's just such a great character. Yeah.
In this episode, they address the fact that

584
00:52:41,802 --> 00:52:46,905
they're bringing a monkey to a fight against
a guy who can essentially control and mutate

585
00:52:46,985 --> 00:52:51,827
animals. But the fact that they address that
idea and still do it makes no sense to me.

586
00:52:52,308 --> 00:52:56,750
Yeah, it's like you guys knew this was going
to happen. So why did it happen? Right. That

587
00:52:56,770 --> 00:53:01,013
was a fight that they probably should have left
Hitmonkey at home for. Or maybe Boon just figured

588
00:53:01,073 --> 00:53:06,075
he could control Hitmonkey. But then again,
that brings up the plot hole of why not just

589
00:53:06,115 --> 00:53:11,699
control the shepherd. Right. Exactly. The scene
with the shepherd shooting himself at the dinner

590
00:53:11,739 --> 00:53:18,643
table was fucking disturbing. Yes. And weird
as hell. Very graphic, like the facial expression

591
00:53:18,663 --> 00:53:24,407
he made right before he shot himself in the
head was creepy and scary. I thought his wife

592
00:53:24,447 --> 00:53:29,426
just looking on smiling, even creepier. Yeah,
the whole relationship was weird. Which is

593
00:53:29,466 --> 00:53:34,070
why it was appropriate that Bryce was like,
what the fuck is going on? Yeah. He was thinking

594
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:39,534
what we were all thinking. Episode seven was
called The Last Supper. Boone reads Hitmonkey's

595
00:53:39,594 --> 00:53:45,159
mind, who deduces where the sword is. The co-op
then sends Hitmonkey to Montauk to get it back.

596
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:50,043
Bryce, Haruka, Iris and Eunice fortify their
vacation home to prepare it for battle and

597
00:53:50,123 --> 00:53:54,907
have what they believe to be their last supper.
Hitmonkey arrives and the group tries to tell

598
00:53:54,927 --> 00:53:59,626
him of the co-op's intentions, but he doesn't
believe them. Bryce and Hitmonkey duke it out

599
00:54:00,046 --> 00:54:05,888
and Bryce admits that he used Hitmonkey's killing
to get out of hell. Akiko and Lady Bullseye

600
00:54:05,948 --> 00:54:10,729
intrude on the scene, and though Haruka tries
to reason with her old friend, she's forced

601
00:54:10,869 --> 00:54:15,670
to wield the sword again. Hitmonkey tries to
shoot Akiko but can't bring himself to do it

602
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:21,612
and Haruka abandons her sword, resulting in
her own death by Akiko's hands. Lady Bullseye's

603
00:54:21,652 --> 00:54:27,086
ghost nearly drowns Bryce in the salty ocean,
but the co-op arrives on the scene. prompting

604
00:54:27,146 --> 00:54:32,810
Lady Bullseye and Akiko to flee. The co-op picks
up the sword and Hitmonkey as Iris and Eunice

605
00:54:32,890 --> 00:54:37,693
pull Bryce out of the ocean. I gotta give a
quick shout out to the state of Colorado in

606
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:43,457
this episode because Iris makes a reference
to Vale during supper and tells them that she

607
00:54:43,497 --> 00:54:46,860
wants to learn how to ski with rich people.
And they're like, oh yeah, that's some good

608
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:52,504
skiing up there. It is. And it's really good
skiing. As someone who has skied Vale, I appreciated

609
00:54:52,544 --> 00:54:58,587
that. I really liked this episode. This is another
one of my favorite episodes. I just loved the

610
00:54:58,667 --> 00:55:04,630
drama of it, you know, with the last supper
where they're eating pancakes and where Bryce

611
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:09,892
and Hentmonkey are brawling out in the rain.
And you understand where both of them are coming

612
00:55:09,952 --> 00:55:15,295
from. It was just, again, a well-written episode.
Emotionally devastating episode. I think this

613
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:19,777
was my favorite episode out of all of them,
for sure. Let's move on to episode eight, which

614
00:55:19,797 --> 00:55:25,559
was called Mindmall. The co-op begins the reforging
process as Boon admits to Hitmonkey that they

615
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:30,340
plan on ending global violence by ending global
life. They reveal themselves to be working

616
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:35,521
with Mephisto, who resurrected Bryce to nudge
him and Hitmonkey to the Alderman and the co-op

617
00:55:35,661 --> 00:55:41,283
in his scheme to end humanity and build his
Hell army. Slyke pulls Hitmonkey into his mind

618
00:55:41,403 --> 00:55:46,844
while Bryce, Eunice, and Iris mourn Haruka back
in Montauk. Akiko spies on them from afar and

619
00:55:46,884 --> 00:55:51,826
kills Lady Pulsai's ghost by using their tether
to pull her into the salty ocean. Back at the

620
00:55:51,846 --> 00:55:56,967
apartment, Dot warns Bryce, Iris, and Eunice
about the co-op's real plans before returning

621
00:55:57,027 --> 00:56:02,789
to their lair and being pulled into Slyke's
mind. Secretly harboring Bryce's ghost, Dot

622
00:56:02,869 --> 00:56:08,491
helps rescue Hitmonkey from his chains and directs
them on how to escape Slyke's mind. While Dot

623
00:56:08,551 --> 00:56:13,593
is able to get out, Slyke and Boone's brother
Colt is revealed to be inside his mind too

624
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:18,831
and destroys the exit. As Hitmonkey and Bryce
flee into Slyke's subconscious, Colt learns

625
00:56:18,851 --> 00:56:24,413
that he was mind controlled by Boon into agreeing
to be pulled into his brother's mind. Slyke

626
00:56:24,593 --> 00:56:29,716
enters his own mind to explain his reasoning
to his brother, but Colt kills him, giving

627
00:56:29,756 --> 00:56:34,738
Hitmonkey and Bryce enough time to escape before
Slyke's mind is eradicated. Witnessing the

628
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:39,820
tragedy of brothers turning on each other, Bryce
and Hitmonkey make amends, just as the co-op

629
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:44,602
prepares to use the power of the Forged Relic
in Times Square. This is another fantastic

630
00:56:44,642 --> 00:56:49,584
episode. This is just like a series of great
episodes. I really liked the mind mall setting

631
00:56:50,104 --> 00:56:55,927
that had a very cool eighties retro vibe, very
vibrant and creepy. It kind of reminded me

632
00:56:55,967 --> 00:57:00,709
of the original Suspiria film, although that
was made in the seventies, but the killer racer

633
00:57:00,849 --> 00:57:04,610
that was chasing him through the mall, I think
that was pulled from an eighties movie called

634
00:57:04,710 --> 00:57:10,373
The Wraith, from what I could tell. Really interesting.
It was all just very surreal and kind of incorporated

635
00:57:10,453 --> 00:57:16,279
dream logic in this really cool way. Now, I
just remembered, are you sure all of the characters

636
00:57:16,339 --> 00:57:24,161
from the co-op were original? Because I remember
you having an X-Men comic with a mutant villain

637
00:57:24,321 --> 00:57:32,463
who was also able to warp beings into his mind.
Yeah, you're talking about the X-Men 394 issue,

638
00:57:32,863 --> 00:57:38,405
which has Wolverine and Jean Grey kissing on
the cover. And in it, they get pulled into

639
00:57:38,525 --> 00:57:43,975
this mutant's mind and his name was Warp Savant.
And while they have the same power set, he's

640
00:57:44,015 --> 00:57:50,498
not Slyke. So it's likely that Slyke was influenced
by Warp Savant. Although Warp Savant only made

641
00:57:50,538 --> 00:57:55,141
an appearance in one issue. Are you serious?
He hasn't appeared since? OK, that's dumb.

642
00:57:55,641 --> 00:57:59,803
OK. But it's interesting that you remembered
that pretty good memory there. I just remember

643
00:57:59,964 --> 00:58:04,006
you getting really pissed off because I got
chocolate on that comic cover and you've probably

644
00:58:04,046 --> 00:58:11,794
never forgiven me for that. You dumbass. I completely
forgot about that, too. Oh, I reminded you.

645
00:58:12,034 --> 00:58:16,197
Out of everyone in the co-op, who would you
say was your favorite? Dot because she was

646
00:58:16,237 --> 00:58:20,420
the only one that was good. But like we didn't
get really any of her backstory either. Well,

647
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:24,983
we didn't really get much of any of the co-op's
backstories except for Boon. Well, we got the

648
00:58:25,063 --> 00:58:30,407
statue lady. I forgot her name. Amara. Yeah,
Amara. I just saw apparently she was voiced

649
00:58:30,467 --> 00:58:35,991
by Stephanie Beatrice. So she has the same voice
as Mirabelle from Encanto. Right. Yeah, it's

650
00:58:36,031 --> 00:58:41,115
interesting comparing her voice as that Disney
character and then saying Get fucked, Bryce.

651
00:58:41,135 --> 00:58:47,100
You know. But no, we never got more than a few
sentences of backstory for any of the co-op

652
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:51,084
members except for Boon. I don't know why Amara
was my favorite. I think I just really liked

653
00:58:51,104 --> 00:58:55,508
her power set. But yeah, Dot was great too.
I loved how strong she was. Like that was her

654
00:58:55,548 --> 00:59:00,373
power, right? Just like super strength and durability.
It's a great power set for a creepy little

655
00:59:00,533 --> 00:59:05,197
girl because you wouldn't expect it. Right.
Episode nine was called the concrete jungle.

656
00:59:05,666 --> 00:59:10,290
Boon unleashes the relic on New York City, transforming
the environment and turning people into trees.

657
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:16,155
Bryce, Eunice, Iris, Dot, and Hitmonkey call
in all of Eunice's mercenary contacts to join

658
00:59:16,175 --> 00:59:21,099
their fight. They plan to use Eunice's bomb
to blow up the relic, with Bryce's team planting

659
00:59:21,119 --> 00:59:26,204
the bomb in the subway tunnels under Times Square,
and Monkey's team triggering the remote detonator.

660
00:59:26,644 --> 00:59:31,288
Both groups get attacked by the co-op, with
Hitmonkey weakened after being shot multiple

661
00:59:31,328 --> 00:59:37,795
times by double tap. and Bryce gets turned to
marble by Amara. However, Hitmonkey ricochets

662
00:59:37,835 --> 00:59:43,317
shoots double tap, and Bryce phases out of his
stone form to trap her on the subway car. Boon

663
00:59:43,377 --> 00:59:48,058
mind controls Dot to attack Hitmonkey, but he
survives long enough for Bryce's bomb to get

664
00:59:48,098 --> 00:59:54,400
there, and he blows up Boon and the relic. However,
Boon survives as a plant monster with pieces

665
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:59,221
of the relic embedded in him. I love at the
start of the episode Hitmonkey's speech to

666
00:59:59,241 --> 01:00:03,960
the other mercenaries. He's like, I know we
all probably need therapy, but we could do

667
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:08,103
this together. We're a family. And his screech
at the end when he's like, now who's with me?

668
01:00:08,123 --> 01:00:12,947
It just crickets. Nobody says anything. But
then like somebody starts to slow clap and

669
01:00:12,987 --> 01:00:16,189
then all of a sudden everybody gets super excited
and they start shooting their guns in the air

670
01:00:16,469 --> 01:00:20,252
and even hit monkey shooting his gun in the
air. It was hilarious. Yeah. And especially

671
01:00:20,272 --> 01:00:25,496
when you find out that they're shooting accidentally
hit the bomb in the coffee table. It's like,

672
01:00:25,516 --> 01:00:31,440
of course. The one thing that I hated about
these last two episodes was how like at certain

673
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:36,723
points the main characters would get covered
in vines but somehow weren't ripped apart to

674
01:00:36,743 --> 01:00:41,145
pieces or transformed into plants just like
everyone else was. It was like if you were

675
01:00:41,165 --> 01:00:46,988
a main character on the show you had plot armor
basically. Yeah, pretty much. Pretty convenient

676
01:00:47,209 --> 01:00:52,712
but I don't know. It's not like they didn't
meet cruel fates later on. I loved the stakes

677
01:00:52,852 --> 01:00:57,454
of this season as a whole. Like they were way
bigger than season one. But the stakes kind

678
01:00:57,494 --> 01:01:03,877
of get ruined once you realize that the main
characters aren't susceptible to the bad guy's

679
01:01:03,917 --> 01:01:09,180
final plan. That's not to say that there weren't
casualties, because of course you have Officer

680
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:14,242
Haruka's death and even Hitmonkey dies by the
end of the show, but I feel like Iris and Eunice

681
01:01:14,522 --> 01:01:18,524
should have been turned into plant creatures.
It's really hard to agree with the whole plot

682
01:01:18,584 --> 01:01:23,874
armor thing considering how everything goes
down at the end. sure Bryce lives at the end,

683
01:01:24,034 --> 01:01:29,037
but he's also trapped in a hell of his own making,
as it were, because he's without Hitmucky.

684
01:01:29,277 --> 01:01:34,039
Or at least the one that he knows. As far as
Eunice and Iris, I'm totally fine with them

685
01:01:34,059 --> 01:01:38,901
having plot armor. You know, after surviving
the attack in Montauk, you know, they had already

686
01:01:38,941 --> 01:01:43,803
gone through a lot. It's fine. Plus I want to
see them continue on into Season 3.

687
01:01:49,058 --> 01:01:54,023
drive to help rescue Bryce, Hitmonkey, and Dot
from the Boon monster. While fleeing in their

688
01:01:54,063 --> 01:02:01,090
van, Iris gets the idea to use Buddy's Bodyburner
to destroy Boon, but the monster crashes the

689
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:06,475
vehicle. The group fights Boon and are overpowered,
but they buy enough time for Iris to use Buddy's

690
01:02:06,515 --> 01:02:11,420
Bodyburner, which is only partially effective.
Bryce and Hitmonkey yank the relic shards from

691
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:17,076
the monster's body. which Boon uses to transport
them across time to witness humanity's violence

692
01:02:17,176 --> 01:02:22,720
throughout history, from feudal Japan to World
War I. They teleport to an animal testing facility

693
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:27,282
in the past where Hitmucky sees his younger
self get rescued from a cage where he and his

694
01:02:27,342 --> 01:02:32,866
parents were being experimented on. Bryce pulls
out the last shard, returning them home and

695
01:02:32,926 --> 01:02:38,649
fully killing Boon. As Bryce runs out of time
on his corporeal form and says goodbye to Iris,

696
01:02:39,270 --> 01:02:44,934
Akiko returns and tries to shoot Iris, forcing
Bryce to take the bullets. Hitmonkey stops

697
01:02:44,974 --> 01:02:50,738
Akiko by tackling her off the Brooklyn Bridge,
an act that kills them both. Mephisto claims

698
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:56,503
Hitmonkey's soul as payment for Bryce's deals,
and Bryce returns to life. As Bryce mourns,

699
01:02:56,863 --> 01:03:02,447
he sees Hitmonkey's ghost, who is now tethered
to him. This was a fantastic final episode.

700
01:03:02,627 --> 01:03:09,206
I really love how it began with Steve the Cleaver.
I don't even know who that dude was and neither

701
01:03:09,246 --> 01:03:14,989
did anybody else. I loved how Steve died trying
to be heroic to buy the group sometime. It

702
01:03:15,009 --> 01:03:20,451
was just fucking decimated. He's like, so good.
No, go on without me. And Bryce was like, yeah,

703
01:03:20,491 --> 01:03:27,674
OK, fine. Closes the door. Yeah, no, give a
shit. The ending was so bittersweet with this

704
01:03:27,714 --> 01:03:31,855
like somber music playing and Bryce just kind
of like staring off playing with some salt

705
01:03:31,875 --> 01:03:36,557
in his hand, you know, thinking about everything
that happened. And he glances over and there's

706
01:03:36,617 --> 01:03:41,861
just this random monkey ghost staring at him
from across the street and he walks over to

707
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:46,144
him and is like, what took you so long? And
that's how the season ended. And I thought

708
01:03:46,164 --> 01:03:51,287
it was so poetic considering both of the characters'
journeys, all that they had been through and

709
01:03:51,307 --> 01:03:55,290
how the script was kind of flipped at the very
end. The best thing I can say about this season

710
01:03:55,330 --> 01:04:01,810
is that I'm really, really wanting more of this
story. Yeah, absolutely. And we're- really

711
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:06,935
stuck with me at the end too was how Hitmonkey
was in a ghost form, but he wasn't like his

712
01:04:07,155 --> 01:04:13,061
old self. Like, he didn't have any of his character.
He was like a shell of what he was. So it's

713
01:04:13,101 --> 01:04:18,526
not like they could reunite in some kind of
satisfying way. It wasn't satisfying. It was

714
01:04:18,666 --> 01:04:24,732
bittersweet, it was heartfelt, and it absolutely
calls for a season three. That brings us to

715
01:04:24,752 --> 01:04:30,924
the end of this review. Overall... The season
mixed fun, brutal action with emotionally tragic

716
01:04:30,984 --> 01:04:36,327
moments, and the silly high-concept premise
has proven itself as Marvel's darkest and most

717
01:04:36,387 --> 01:04:45,513
challenging project. I'm giving the show 4.5
stars out of 5, a fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

718
01:04:45,553 --> 01:04:50,375
Yeah, I think that's totally appropriate. I
personally love me a good tragedy. And this

719
01:04:50,415 --> 01:04:56,090
is a tragedy, I would say, in the true sense
of the word. and that comedies have happy endings

720
01:04:56,110 --> 01:05:01,932
and tragedies have somewhat sad endings. The
fact that this tragedy was also able to make

721
01:05:01,972 --> 01:05:08,553
me laugh for a majority of the season is also
a testament to just how well-written it was.

722
01:05:08,773 --> 01:05:14,855
I do think it was better than season one, which
we gave four stars. So yeah, I would agree

723
01:05:14,875 --> 01:05:19,336
with that rating. Yeah, season two just hit
harder, both emotionally, viscerally, with

724
01:05:19,356 --> 01:05:24,758
the violence. Animation was top notch. Animation-wise.
Really good animation, yeah. And the show is

725
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:29,681
just cool. Like it is so cool. Like I'm trying
to think of anything as cool as this show.

726
01:05:30,261 --> 01:05:36,084
Himaki has a vibe to him. You know, it's hard
to put into words the idea of cool, but you

727
01:05:36,104 --> 01:05:40,386
could definitely feel it when watching the show.
For sure. They knew what the tone was and I

728
01:05:40,406 --> 01:05:45,949
think they nailed it. So kudos to the show runners.
But that does it for this review. AJ9K, help

be another review. but it's the last one of

735
01:06:22,422 --> 01:06:26,903
the group before we get back to the duels guys.
We're going to be reviewing Watchmen Chapter

736
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:32,985
one, which hopefully the animation is good because
it's going to be really hard going into that

737
01:06:33,065 --> 01:06:38,406
coming off of Hit Monkey, just with how expressive
and well done the animation was. I have a feeling

738
01:06:38,486 --> 01:06:44,648
it's not going to be as good and I know we already
know the Watchmen story, so I'm not sure how

739
01:06:44,748 --> 01:06:49,742
satisfying watching this will be, but we'll
let you guys know next week. But that does

740
01:06:49,762 --> 01:06:54,164

744
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:16,456

Up, up, and away, true believers. This shit

745
01:07:16,516 --> 01:07:18,597
