1
00:00:03,284 --> 00:00:03,345
you

2
00:00:23,886 --> 00:00:28,508
Dual Podcast, a weekly show where we review
superhero films and debate the superiority

3
00:00:28,808 --> 00:00:34,151
between Marvel and DC by comparing their characters
in stat-based battle simulations. I'm Marvelous

4
00:00:34,211 --> 00:00:39,134
Joe. And I'm his twin brother, Johnny DC. And
in this episode, we will be finding out who

5
00:00:39,154 --> 00:00:44,557
would win in a fight between the Riddler and
Arcade, the X-Men villain. This is going to

6
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:47,959
be one of the more unique dual episodes that
we've ever done. We're dealing with characters

7
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:52,161
that don't really get into physical altercations.
They prefer to fight with their mind. They're

8
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:57,376
all about prep time. Yeah, these characters
create these elaborate traps for the heroes

9
00:00:57,396 --> 00:01:01,699
they go up against, but also considering the
fact that we don't take environment into account,

10
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,481
we had to get creative when it came to finding
a way to pit these characters against each

11
00:01:06,522 --> 00:01:10,264
other. Yeah, so go ahead and stay tuned to later
on this episode when we actually delve into

12
00:01:10,284 --> 00:01:14,086
this match and run the simulations and find
out who would win. Before we get into that

13
00:01:14,126 --> 00:01:18,009
duel matchup, we're going to go over the news
from the past week, of which there wasn't very

14
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:23,432
much. We'll be talking about how the John Wick
director, Chats Tihelsky, is going to be directing

15
00:01:23,452 --> 00:01:27,234
the action scenes for the Birds of Prey movie.
As always, you can look up the segment times

16
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:31,036
in the episode description to go ahead and jump
to whatever topic you wanna listen to. But

17
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:35,358
before we get into the news, we just wanna give
a quick shout out to Ben O'Neill, who gave

18
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:41,442
us a second review on iTunes. Yeah, I guess
he has two accounts or something. Or he's just

19
00:01:41,522 --> 00:01:45,864
using someone else's account. I don't know quite
how Apple would feel about that. Hey, you know

20
00:01:45,884 --> 00:01:49,658
what? We got a rating. We got a rating. We got
a rating. We're at 138. We're that much closer

21
00:01:49,678 --> 00:01:55,063
to our 200 ratings on Apple Podcasts. Once we
get to 200 ratings, Ron Tomatoes says we're

22
00:01:55,123 --> 00:02:00,087
eligible to have our reviews of Marvel and DC
films count toward those films tomato meters.

23
00:02:00,227 --> 00:02:04,290
Which is a huge dream of ours. We have wanted
to be film critics ever since we were in high

24
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,193
school. So if you guys can help us get there,
it'd be hugely appreciated. We love putting

25
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:11,856
this show together for you guys every week.
And if you guys could just give back by doing

26
00:02:11,876 --> 00:02:16,760
that, it'd be fantastic. Yes, please and thank
you. But now that that's done, quick to the

27
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,195
no prize. So a No Prize is an award that Marvel
used to give out up until the 90s to fans.

28
00:02:23,395 --> 00:02:27,957
Our version, the Dynamic Duel No Prize, is a
digital award that we post on social media

29
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:32,679
that I personally draw for those who we feel
gave the best answer to our question of the

30
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:38,621
week. Last week's question was, what character
from the Spider-Man comics do you most want

31
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:44,104
to see Phil Lord and Chris Miller adapt into
a live action television series? And this is

32
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:47,905
coming off the news that Phil Lord and Chris
Miller, who are the producers of the Into the

33
00:02:47,945 --> 00:02:53,633
Spider-Verse movie, They signed a contract with
Sony to develop several live action Spider-Man

34
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:57,296
based television series. So we got a lot of
great answers of the shows that you guys would

35
00:02:57,336 --> 00:03:02,300
like to see. The first honorable mention goes
to Anna Kosasa, who gave the answer of Squadron

36
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,645
Sinister and the Grandmaster. Now this was not
an answer that was really Spider-Man adjacent.

37
00:03:08,025 --> 00:03:11,868
I don't consider the Squadron Supreme or Squadron
Sinister to be part of the Spider-Man universe.

38
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:16,212
It's possible that she may have meant Sinister
6, but she also mentioned the Grandmaster,

39
00:03:16,272 --> 00:03:21,059
so I'm not sure. Either way... A show involving
these characters, especially the Grandmaster,

40
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:25,282
would be pretty damn incredible. Christian Rubito
also gets honorable mention for his answer

41
00:03:25,382 --> 00:03:30,226
of Hydro Man. Yeah, Hydro Man. I don't know
if he might be the only one that wants a television

42
00:03:30,246 --> 00:03:34,709
show based on Hydro Man. That being said, I
do agree that Hydro Man is severely underrated.

43
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:38,411
It would have been cool to maybe see him down
the line, like way down the line in a Spider-Man

44
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:42,354
movie. Although they kind of use that up with
the Elementals from Far From Home. But he's

45
00:03:42,414 --> 00:03:46,497
pretty powerful. Honorable mention also goes
to Caleb Albers, who gave the answer of Spider-Man

46
00:03:46,537 --> 00:03:51,336
2099. He was afraid that this answer was gonna
be like the quote basic bitch answer. And it

47
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:56,318
was and it was because lots of other people
answered Spider-Man 2099, including Chris Castaneda,

48
00:03:56,859 --> 00:04:02,082
Tim Brown and Matthew Gonzalez. Although Matthew
Gonzalez also mentioned Spider-Punk. What I

49
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:06,484
really like about Spider-Man 2099, though, is
that in some ways, this is the perfect answer.

50
00:04:06,624 --> 00:04:10,546
And that's probably why so many people gave
it because you have such an opportunity for

51
00:04:10,566 --> 00:04:16,229
like high concept, high octane science fiction
action within this. It could be like Tron.

52
00:04:16,598 --> 00:04:21,560
meets Fifth Element meets Spider-Man. Sold.
Exactly. So many great things, so many cool

53
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:26,962
things that can be done with a Spider-Man 2099
show. So yeah, great answer, guys. Jeff Miles

54
00:04:27,002 --> 00:04:32,125
Jr. also gets honorable mention for his answer
of Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy. Yeah, he wants

55
00:04:32,165 --> 00:04:36,147
to see that relationship further develop in
a television show, although I think Sony's

56
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:40,189
gonna prefer to explore that within the Spider-Verse
sequel that they're making. In the animated

57
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:45,091
universe that they've established. Right. Honorable
mention goes to John Spies for also giving

58
00:04:45,111 --> 00:04:49,633
the answer of Miles Morales. And Harrison Fox
gave the answer of Spider-Gwen, as did Matt

59
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:55,395
Estes. Honorable mention goes to Joel Seagrave
who said that he wants a Clone Saga television

60
00:04:55,435 --> 00:04:59,817
show, which could be really fascinating. You
know, the Clone Saga was a series from the

61
00:04:59,897 --> 00:05:04,399
90s that Marvel put out that was often derided
by fans because it left us questioning whether

62
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:09,061
or not Peter Parker was actually, you know,
the real Peter Parker or not. I think that's

63
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:13,684
kind of a fascinating concept. especially when
it's explored on its own outside of, you know,

64
00:05:13,744 --> 00:05:17,627
everything else that is Peter Parker related.
Just like seeing what they're getting up to,

65
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:21,290
I think, would make a pretty decent show. It's
interesting how you could explore both Peter

66
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:26,915
Parker's clones and his multiverse selves. There's
like so many, just so many different versions

67
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:30,859
of Spider-Man in the Marvel Comics universe.
And I think Joel Segrave mentioned that if

68
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,822
anyone could get that right, it's Phil Lord
and Chris Miller. Yeah, definitely. They're

69
00:05:34,842 --> 00:05:40,667
great writers. Aaron Alexander Jones also gave
the answer of the Clone Saga. Salvador Martinez

70
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:45,491
gave the answer of a man spider. It's when Peter
Parker mutated into a spider. And he said that

71
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:49,635
the series could follow Madam Webb trying to
put a stop to him. And he said a twist at the

72
00:05:49,675 --> 00:05:54,559
end could be that man spider fuses with carnage,
which would be so deadly and pretty bad ass.

73
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,544
Ken Johnson gets honorable mention for his answer
of Craven. Yeah, that would be a fantastic

74
00:05:59,564 --> 00:06:04,128
show. I'm not sure quite how it would work.
I guess you would have him like hunting a different

75
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:09,063
quarry like every week. It could be like, you
know, dog the bounty hunter, but without the

76
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:14,886
bounty, just the hunter, you know, I totally
see like a fat craving, just like balding spring

77
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:20,089
bear mace in people's face. Right. Exactly.
They believe that Sony is currently working

78
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:24,752
on a live action feature length film for this
character and much in the same way that they're

79
00:06:24,772 --> 00:06:29,514
working on Morbius and Venom. Yeah, that's the
rumor. Colby Hentges gave the answer of Superior

80
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:33,517
Spider-Man, which I think would be a fantastic
mini series. Superior Spider-Man was a great

81
00:06:33,557 --> 00:06:38,563
book. I love the aesthetic. of the character.
Like I wish that was just Peter Parker, like

82
00:06:38,623 --> 00:06:42,865
not Doctor Octopus. Just give all that gear
to Peter Parker. He should have adapted all

83
00:06:42,906 --> 00:06:47,268
those upgrades that Doctor Octopus made to his
whole getup when he became Spider-Man. Right?

84
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:53,391
Yeah. And finally, Red Hood gave the answer
of Spider-X, Blood Spider, or Ezekiel Sims,

85
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:58,546
who are probably like the three most obscure
characters in Spider-Man anthology. You know,

86
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:02,667
having only been in a handful of issues themselves.
Yeah, I think I only know one of those characters.

87
00:07:02,727 --> 00:07:06,168
But you know, a television show is a great way
to explore these characters and develop them

88
00:07:06,228 --> 00:07:12,470
even further. But the winner of this week's
No Prize goes to C.J. Kraft for his answer

89
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:18,892
of Spider-Man Noir. And the way he described
the show made it seem like basically Sin City.

90
00:07:19,552 --> 00:07:24,173
I would love to see a Spider-Man Noir meets
like Sin City type show. That one just really

91
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:29,420
captured my imagination. just as much as a Spider-Man
2099 show would capture my imagination. Really,

92
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,802
both of those ideas have equal merit, but CJ
Kraft was the only one that gave the Spider-Man

93
00:07:33,842 --> 00:07:37,804
no answer, so he gave it to him, basically.
Yeah, I love the visual look of what Robert

94
00:07:37,844 --> 00:07:42,947
Rodriguez did with the Sin City live action
movies. It's just so stylish, it's so cool.

95
00:07:43,327 --> 00:07:49,131
And now make it more 1930s and add Spider-Man
into the mix. Boom. So congrats to CJ Kraft.

96
00:07:49,211 --> 00:07:52,372
You win this week's No Prize, so Jonathan will
go ahead and draw. Who are you drawing this

97
00:07:52,392 --> 00:07:56,493
week? I'm drawing Arcade. You're gonna get a
drawing of Arcade that we'll post to social

98
00:07:56,513 --> 00:08:00,198
media, go ahead and check that out. If you,
the listener, want to win your own No Prize,

99
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:05,066
go ahead and stay tuned to later on this episode
when we ask another question of the week. Now

100
00:08:05,106 --> 00:08:06,648
that that's done, on to the news!

101
00:08:12,554 --> 00:08:17,717
Okay, so the Hollywood Reporter broke the news
a few days ago that John Wick director Chad

102
00:08:17,757 --> 00:08:25,062
Stahelski is going to design and tackle new
action scenes for the Birds of Prey film dropping

103
00:08:25,142 --> 00:08:29,665
next February. Now there's two different ways
you can take this news. Essentially the first

104
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:33,628
way that I took it was, oh, Birds of Prey, you
know, the movie's in trouble, it doesn't have

105
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:37,030
good enough action, they're gonna have to bring
in someone to help fix this movie, kind of

106
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:41,826
like the way they had to fix Rogue One with
Star Wars. Or like World War Z. Yeah. But those

107
00:08:41,866 --> 00:08:46,307
movies turned out great. They did actually.
What's the other way you could take it? The

108
00:08:46,327 --> 00:08:50,288
other way you could take it is that, hey, you
know, a lot of these directors don't actually

109
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:54,769
shoot a lot of the action scenes in their films.
Like take the Russo brothers, for example,

110
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:58,830
they use a lot of second unit direction when
it comes to high octane action. That's one

111
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,551
of the reasons why The Winter Soldier was so
good. And guess who directed the action scenes

112
00:09:02,871 --> 00:09:08,773
in The Winter Soldier? Chad Stahelski. What,
he did? Yeah. Holy shit. Yeah, he's also done

113
00:09:08,853 --> 00:09:13,192
Ninja Assassin, he's done The Hunger Games.
He started off actually as Keanu Reeves stunt

114
00:09:13,232 --> 00:09:20,118
double in The Matrix before breaking into direction.
His stunt firm, I think it's called 8711, was

115
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:24,802
already working on this film, doing the stunts
for it. And they're like, they're doing insane

116
00:09:24,862 --> 00:09:29,145
stunt work right now. If you've seen any of
the John Wick films, you know how crazy their

117
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:34,650
stuff is. He's directed all of the John Wick
films. He co-directed the first John Wick with

118
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,446
David Leitch, who later went on to work on films
like Deadpool 2. Right, right. What's interesting

119
00:09:39,506 --> 00:09:45,068
here is that he is taking an uncredited role
directing these action scenes. Well, he's not

120
00:09:45,088 --> 00:09:48,050
getting a director credit. I think that's what
they were mentioning. I assume that he's still

121
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:52,192
going to get credited for his stunt work. I
mean, his firm will, but the shots he's directing

122
00:09:52,232 --> 00:09:56,474
will be uncredited. My interpretation of that
uncredited news would be that he wouldn't get

123
00:09:56,494 --> 00:10:00,575
a co-director credit, given that he's a big
name. Yeah, I guess we'll see when it comes

124
00:10:00,695 --> 00:10:06,374
out. I think this is good news. It is good news.
It is. It is great news. If you're gonna get

125
00:10:06,494 --> 00:10:10,618
any action director to direct your action scenes,
get the fucking guy that did John Wick in Winter

126
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:15,882
Soldier. In my opinion, he is like the biggest
name in stunt work and action scenes in the

127
00:10:15,922 --> 00:10:21,227
business right now. So hopefully by him taking
this work, maybe he'll get a bigger DC Comics

128
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:25,631
character to work with in the future. What characters
would you like to see him work with? Personally,

129
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:30,655
I've always wanted to see a question film. He's
not superhuman, so there'd be an opportunity

130
00:10:30,695 --> 00:10:35,519
for a lot of stunt work. It's pretty gritty.
Yeah. But all of that could also probably describe

131
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:39,122
the Birds of Prey. So it seems like it's a good
fit. Yeah, the Birds of Prey have never been

132
00:10:39,162 --> 00:10:43,726
really overtly superpowered. So you can get
really grounded with the action. Exactly, exactly.

133
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:48,329
And actually, I just realized if David Leitch
directed Deadpool, Stahelski should direct

134
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:53,574
Deathstroke. Oh, that would be sweet. That movie
needs to be made. His action style is probably

135
00:10:53,614 --> 00:10:57,317
more suited to someone like Deathstroke than,
say, the Birds of Prey, because Deathstroke

136
00:10:57,397 --> 00:11:02,020
uses guns. Does anyone from Birds of Prey use
guns? Huntress uses a crossbow. Harley Quinn

137
00:11:02,081 --> 00:11:06,995
uses guns. Oh, that's true. Ultimately, I think
this movie may have the best action scenes

138
00:11:07,215 --> 00:11:12,297
we've ever seen in a DC film. Well, that's a
short bar to clear, honestly. Oh, fuck off.

139
00:11:13,198 --> 00:11:20,881
Name a great DC action scene. Uh, Batman v Superman,
the warehouse scene. That's like the only one.

140
00:11:21,001 --> 00:11:26,723
The only like grounded one. There's plenty of
action scenes. Yeah, that are crap. Oh, oh,

141
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:32,634
okay. Black Manta versus Aquaman was crap. Okay,
no, that was pretty good actually. Wonder Woman

142
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:37,479
and the enemy soldiers in the town was crap?
Nah, yeah you're right. They've had a few,

143
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:43,084
they've had a few. Superman versus Zod was crap?
No, yeah that was totally shit. I can't give

144
00:11:43,104 --> 00:11:47,808
you that one. I wouldn't expect you to know
good action. This all brings us to our question

145
00:11:47,828 --> 00:11:49,010
of the week. What is the most important thing
in a movie?

146
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:59,113
What is your favorite action scene in a Marvel
or DC film? Post your answer to our Instagram,

147
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:05,416
Twitter, Facebook, or email us at dyna We'll
pick our favorite answer and draw that person

148
00:12:05,457 --> 00:12:10,699
a dynamic duel no prize that we'll post to social
media. But that does it for all the news. There's

149
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:14,422
nothing really else too much to talk about that's
not a rumor. So who knows, maybe next week

150
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:19,404
will be a heavy news week. But now let's get
into our main event where we pit Arcade against

151
00:12:19,484 --> 00:12:21,425
Riddler and find out who will be the champion.

152
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:42,212
Alright, Arcade versus Riddler. We have a primarily
X-Men villain in Arcade and a Batman villain

153
00:12:42,252 --> 00:12:48,235
in the Riddler. Two characters who primarily
fight using not their fists, but their brains.

154
00:12:48,456 --> 00:12:52,658
And of course we're doing this match now, having
just come off of our review of Batman Hush

155
00:12:52,998 --> 00:12:57,941
last week, in which the Riddler played a pretty
prominent role. He was so great in that movie,

156
00:12:58,081 --> 00:13:02,323
in Batman Hush. So we knew that we had to use
him for a duel in this episode, and who better

157
00:13:02,343 --> 00:13:07,602
to pit him against than Marvel's own suit wearing
puzzling trickster, Arcade. Now if this is

158
00:13:07,622 --> 00:13:12,044
your first time listening to one of our duel
episodes, the way we determine the winner between

159
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:17,648
these two characters is we run a series of Monte
Carlo simulations using the characters' base

160
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:22,971
stats. Now these stats are randomized along
a normal distribution which is a bell curve

161
00:13:23,151 --> 00:13:27,334
and that represents all the different variables
that take place in battle. We use the stats

162
00:13:27,354 --> 00:13:31,636
that are given in the Marvel official power
rankings and we extrapolate the DC character

163
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:36,491
stats from those criteria. And we also incorporate
a few more stats just to make a more robust

164
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:43,254
simulation. We take this approach because Joseph
and I are both heavily biased in favor of either

165
00:13:43,314 --> 00:13:47,715
DC or Marvel. Right. And this is the most scientific
approach that we could think of to determine

166
00:13:47,735 --> 00:13:52,177
the answer of who would win. Exactly. It was
the same approach that Spike TV did in their

167
00:13:52,197 --> 00:13:56,739
show Deadliest Warrior that was on the air about
10 or so years ago. Probably more than that

168
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:02,181
now. Yeah. The simulation results give us a
percentage of wins for each character because

169
00:14:02,402 --> 00:14:07,185
There's always one way a character can defeat
another, always a way for Batman to defeat

170
00:14:07,265 --> 00:14:12,228
Superman. Right, so no character ever wins 100%
of the time if we've done our job right in

171
00:14:12,349 --> 00:14:17,372
picking a fair matchup. So we don't consider
fan votes, and we don't consider like extraordinary

172
00:14:17,432 --> 00:14:21,035
feats of strength that are uncharacteristic
for the character. Right. 90% of the time.

173
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:25,318
It's just these base stats with simulations.
Now before we run these simulations, we like

174
00:14:25,338 --> 00:14:29,941
to go into the histories and abilities of each
character. I think it's my turn to go first

175
00:14:29,961 --> 00:14:34,050
with Arcade. Now I'm not sure how many people
out there actually know a lot about the history

176
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:38,392
of arcade given that he hasn't been in a whole
lot of comic book issues. I don't remember

177
00:14:38,412 --> 00:14:43,533
him from the cartoon at all. You don't? No.
He was in X-Men Evolution, he was even in Ultimate

178
00:14:43,573 --> 00:14:46,914
Spider-Man cartoon. Oh wow. Yeah, he's been
in a lot of different things. Primarily though,

179
00:14:47,134 --> 00:14:52,355
I think he really works best in the video games.
I remember the arcade boss battle in Marvel

180
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:56,577
Ultimate Alliance. The whole murder world level
was incredible. He was a villain that was like

181
00:14:56,617 --> 00:15:01,215
tailor-made for video games. What was the name
like, arcade? You would hope so. Right, exactly.

182
00:15:02,055 --> 00:15:07,060
So little is known about the villain Arcade's
early history. Even his real name has never

183
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:11,904
been revealed. He has told, however, that he
was born to an incredibly wealthy family and

184
00:15:11,924 --> 00:15:18,189
had a lifelong fixation with toys and games.
His father detested his childish hobbies and

185
00:15:18,229 --> 00:15:23,193
abused Arcade when he was young. On his 21st
birthday, his parents withdrew his trust fund,

186
00:15:23,573 --> 00:15:28,417
and in retaliation, Arcade killed his parents
with a car bomb, inheriting all their wealth.

187
00:15:29,098 --> 00:15:33,340
It's unknown if that story is actually part
of Arcade's past or not, or if he made it up

188
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,383
just for his own sick enjoyment. What is known
is that as a young adult, Arcade turned his

189
00:15:38,443 --> 00:15:44,907
enjoyment of murder into a career as an assassin,
charging $1 million per contract. Over time,

190
00:15:45,187 --> 00:15:50,290
he grew bored of killing people using conventional
means, and started using his technological

191
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:56,782
genius to build elaborate murder traps in a
mobile facility he called Murderworld. He based

192
00:15:56,822 --> 00:16:01,384
his traps on his targets greatest fears and
weaknesses. By vetting his victims and learning

193
00:16:01,564 --> 00:16:06,027
everything about them, he could tailor his deadly
machinations to provide them with the most

194
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:11,350
amount of despair, while simultaneously providing
himself with the most amount of amusement.

195
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:16,993
He enjoys watching people die. Though Arcade
loved relishing how much his victims suffered,

196
00:16:17,193 --> 00:16:20,875
he would often laugh at and taunt them through
a loudspeaker, he would always give them a

197
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:26,855
tiny chance of escape for sport. Though no one
ever escaped. Murderworld made him renowned

198
00:16:26,895 --> 00:16:32,298
in the criminal underworld, and he took on the
codename Arcade. He's a lot like Jigsaw from

199
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:36,561
the Saw films. Yeah, pretty much. And I guess
like the Riddler from the Arkham games. Yeah,

200
00:16:36,601 --> 00:16:40,404
although Arcade is a little bit more whimsical,
or at least he used to be. Like one of his

201
00:16:40,464 --> 00:16:45,407
most memorable appearances was when he put the
X-Men in a giant pinball machine. That sounds

202
00:16:45,427 --> 00:16:51,091
cool, actually. So Arcade hired two assistants.
Mr. Chambers, his chief engineer, and Miss

203
00:16:51,171 --> 00:16:56,935
Locke, a martial arts expert and field agent,
to lure Arcade's victims into Murder World.

204
00:16:57,315 --> 00:17:01,317
She was also Arcade's lover, and the two often
played deadly games with each other for the

205
00:17:01,337 --> 00:17:07,000
thrill. Over time, Arcade killed numerous conventional
targets and eventually grew bored again, but

206
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:12,483
a contract to kill Captain Britain led to the
first Murder World escape, and brought a newfound

207
00:17:12,543 --> 00:17:17,826
enjoyment to Arcade, who decided he would dedicate
his resources toward killing superheroes. Not

208
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:19,607
for the money, but for the challenge.

209
00:17:24,018 --> 00:17:29,799
and teams such as X-Men, X-Factor, and Excalibur.
But although the heroes kept escaping, Arcade

210
00:17:29,819 --> 00:17:34,561
at least managed to avoid capture himself each
time. One day, while recuperating from his

211
00:17:34,601 --> 00:17:39,122
latest failure, he grew angry and stabbed his
lover Miss Locke too deep while they were in

212
00:17:39,182 --> 00:17:44,284
bed playing with a knife. Unable to cope with
the idea that he murdered her, he convinced

213
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:48,785
himself that Wolverine had done it, and employed
the mutant illusionist mastermind to help him

214
00:17:48,825 --> 00:17:54,347
get his revenge. Mastermind learned the truth
and turned on Arcade, imprisoning him in a

215
00:17:54,427 --> 00:17:59,469
murder world in his own mind. Arcade later recovered
and went on to terrorize superheroes such as

216
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:04,712
Deadpool, Hercules, and Black Cat, once teaming
up with the mystical villain Nightmare to create

217
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:10,414
a murder world that was a terrifying labyrinth.
However, Arcade still had yet to keep a hero

218
00:18:10,454 --> 00:18:14,756
from escaping. After learning that most other
villains thought of him as a gimmicky joke,

219
00:18:15,236 --> 00:18:20,671
Arcade grew depressed and decided that playing
for amusement... was less important than playing

220
00:18:20,731 --> 00:18:25,454
to win. He hired a new assistant named Miss
Coriander who helped him build a murder world

221
00:18:25,554 --> 00:18:31,318
in Antarctica using nanotechnology, as well
as a special suit that would grant him god-like

222
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:37,522
powers within the facility. He captured young
teenage heroes from Avengers Academy, the Runaways,

223
00:18:37,682 --> 00:18:41,585
and Xavier School for the Gifted, and told them
they would have to kill each other, and that

224
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:46,208
only the survivor would escape. In the Avengers
Arena miniseries, he pretty much admitted that

225
00:18:46,268 --> 00:18:49,730
he stole the idea from the Hunger Games books.
I was gonna say Battle Royale. Yeah, but...

226
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:55,592
Well... The young heroes instantly rebelled,
but he used his god powers to kill Metal from

227
00:18:55,612 --> 00:19:00,293
the Avengers Academy. Red Raven then tried to
escape, but she broke her neck by slamming

228
00:19:00,393 --> 00:19:06,595
into the facility's barrier. Oh jeez. The teens
fled and hid across Murderworld, creating alliances

229
00:19:06,695 --> 00:19:11,376
just as Arcade hoped. He manipulated the terrain
and drew them toward each other with supplies

230
00:19:11,396 --> 00:19:17,286
and weapons, leading to a hero named Anachronism
killing Kid Brittain. The Game of Death brought

231
00:19:17,306 --> 00:19:22,507
out the dark side of the hero Apex, who killed
Avengers Academy teammate Justin Seifert and

232
00:19:22,547 --> 00:19:27,909
Runaways member Nico Minoru. Although Nico managed
to resurrect herself and in turn killed Apex

233
00:19:27,989 --> 00:19:33,070
and Deathlock it, who is the cyborg daughter
of the creator of the Deathlock program. When

234
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:38,032
the Avengers began investigating the teens'
disappearance, Arcade used robots wearing the

235
00:19:38,072 --> 00:19:44,106
dead teens' skin to convince them everything
was fine. As more of the teens died... it seemed

236
00:19:44,146 --> 00:19:50,049
Arcade had finally achieved success as a supervillain.
The contest was cut short however when Deathlocket

237
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:55,132
was revealed to have survived her death and
accessed Murderworld's control panel. But Arcade

238
00:19:55,172 --> 00:20:00,295
managed to teleport away and uploaded the events
of that Murderworld to YouTube, finally earning

239
00:20:00,335 --> 00:20:06,859
him respect among his peers. The story was so
brutal. I highly suggest reading Avengers Arena

240
00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:11,121
if you haven't already. You already know the
ending, but you know, you knew the ending of

241
00:20:11,161 --> 00:20:15,565
Hunger Games. before you saw that or read the
book, so you know, read it. I highly recommend

242
00:20:15,605 --> 00:20:20,790
it. So a few of the surviving heroes from the
Antarctic murder world managed to track Arcade

243
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:25,334
down by going undercover in the Masters of Evil.
They strapped into the front of a S.H.I.E.L.D.

244
00:20:25,615 --> 00:20:30,359
helicarrier as they flew around on their missions,
and that was the last that he was seen. Holy

245
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,863
cow. Now Arcade has a genius level intellect
and is an expert when it comes to electronics,

246
00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:40,188
robotics, engineering, and design. He even taught
himself to master the She-R holographic technology

247
00:20:40,228 --> 00:20:44,912
that once powered the X-Men's danger room training
sessions. He prefers not to fight, but has

248
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:49,296
a history involving some hand-to-hand training.
He also has equipped various personal defense

249
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:54,180
weapons, but instead he prefers to defeat his
enemies in Murder World, as his main weakness

250
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,384
is definitely his intense need for entertaining
mental stimulation. And that's arcade. He has

251
00:20:59,404 --> 00:21:04,568
like super ADD. And you combine that with violent
psychopathic tendencies, and you have a recipe

252
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:09,371
for disaster. He's a really fascinating villain,
one that I really never gave enough credit

253
00:21:09,491 --> 00:21:13,633
until I read up on him. That recipe for disaster
is pretty close to the recipe that made the

254
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:17,234
Riddler as well. Really? There's some strong
connections there. Interesting, let's hear

255
00:21:17,254 --> 00:21:23,397
it. Now the Riddler, aka Edward Nigma, is one
of the most notorious and ridiculed villains

256
00:21:23,457 --> 00:21:30,460
of Batman's Rogue's gallery. Born Edward Nashton,
he grew up to an abusive father and absentee

257
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:36,202
mother. While in school at a young age, Edward's
teacher promised a prize to the student who

258
00:21:36,222 --> 00:21:42,144
could solve a puzzle the fastest. Showing both
compulsive and narcissistic tendencies early

259
00:21:42,304 --> 00:21:47,306
on, Edward broke into the school at night to
figure out how to solve the puzzle in under

260
00:21:47,326 --> 00:21:53,369
a minute, and when he did it the next day, he
was given a book of riddles as a prize. Edward's

261
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:58,851
intelligence was often praised, but not by his
father, who disliked his son being smarter

262
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:06,114
than him and often accused him of cheating,
something Edward himself would later in life.

263
00:22:06,455 --> 00:22:11,359
His father's beatings only drove Edward's obsession
with proving his intellectual superiority,

264
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:18,025
suffering from severe insecurity-borne distress
if he was unable to do so. Like a surprising

265
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:24,010
many of Batman's villains, the Riddler worked
early on at a carnival, where he used his deductive

266
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:29,355
skills to cheat the carnival goers out of their
money. Wishing to move up in the world, he

267
00:22:29,395 --> 00:22:34,495
changed his name to Edward Nigma. and climbed
up the corporate world to become the chief

268
00:22:34,535 --> 00:22:40,037
strategist at Wayne Enterprises during Bruce
Wayne's worldwide travels in preparation to

269
00:22:40,057 --> 00:22:46,380
fight crime in Gotham City. With Edward's shady
backdoor schemes and profiteering exposed upon

270
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:52,963
Bruce Wayne's return, Edward's career was left
in ruins. Wishing revenge against Wayne Enterprises

271
00:22:53,263 --> 00:22:55,944
and all of the idiots in Gotham City, Edward

272
00:22:59,906 --> 00:23:06,228
during a hurricane as the Riddler, making him
the first masked villain of Batman's crime-fighting

273
00:23:06,268 --> 00:23:13,051
career post-New 52. Further threatening the
city with explosive weather balloons, the Riddler's

274
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:18,053
secret location was eventually tracked down
by Batman, and when the Riddler threatened

275
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:23,475
to blow up the city unless Batman could solve
twelve of his riddles, Batman surprisingly

276
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:25,836
answered by punching the Riddler in the face.

277
00:23:30,222 --> 00:23:35,906
That's pretty good. Diagnosed with a form of
obsessive-compulsive disorder, Edward was sentenced

278
00:23:36,006 --> 00:23:41,229
to Arkham Asylum for psychiatric treatment.

00:23:41,249 --> 00:23:48,154
vs. Moon Knight episode. So after proving himself
a valuable criminal profiler and apt informant

280
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:53,198
of Gotham's underworld to the police force,
the Riddler eventually grew bored at Arkham

281
00:23:53,418 --> 00:23:57,561
and walked out simply by reciting the names
of the guards' loved ones as they confronted

282
00:23:57,581 --> 00:24:03,288
him. Huh. Offering to team up with the Joker
to kill Batman, the Riddler was instead shot

283
00:24:03,488 --> 00:24:09,051
by the Clown Prince of Crime, starting a large-scale
gang war known as the War of Jokes and Riddles,

284
00:24:09,452 --> 00:24:15,555
in which Batman's rogues divided their loyalties
into two factions, the Joker's or the Riddler's.

285
00:24:15,915 --> 00:24:21,438
Batman eventually sided with the Riddler in
an attempt to stem the amount of innocent bystanders

286
00:24:21,518 --> 00:24:27,121
killed in the supervillain feud, though by the
end, Batman nearly killed the Riddler in anger.

287
00:24:27,706 --> 00:24:32,669
and Edward and the Joker were sent back to Arkham.
You can of course learn more about the Joker

288
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:38,794
in our Joker vs Green Goblin episode. During
one of his stints at the asylum, the Riddler

289
00:24:38,814 --> 00:24:44,638
was freed along with the rest of Batman's enemies
by the villain Bane during the Nightfall storyline,

290
00:24:44,938 --> 00:24:50,783
which you can learn more about in our Bane vs
Iron Fist episode. The Riddler, psychologically

291
00:24:50,963 --> 00:24:57,639
incapable of not leaving clues to stop his crimes,
sent several letters to the Gotham Police Department,

292
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:03,003
all of which were ignored as the police were
overwhelmed by the other Arkham villains out

293
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:09,107
causing mayhem. After the Riddler's henchmen
abandoned him after they grew tired of waiting

294
00:25:09,127 --> 00:25:14,791
for the police to fall into his trap, the Riddler
hijacked a local news television show in a

295
00:25:14,831 --> 00:25:19,594
bid for attention, holding the live audience
hostage with a bomb detonator.

296
00:25:24,394 --> 00:25:33,377
He was thwarted by Robin alone after the sidekick
deduced that the Riddler's bomb was fake. Now,

297
00:25:33,417 --> 00:25:39,340
considered an incompetent joke amongst Gotham's
underworld for most of his career, the Riddler

298
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:44,882
was elevated to a new threatening level during
the Hush storyline when the Riddler bathed

299
00:25:44,982 --> 00:25:50,784
in a rejuvenating Lazarus pit in a desperate
move to cure a malignant tumor that had developed

300
00:25:50,824 --> 00:25:58,808
in his brain. Brought about by the Lazarus Pit,
the Riddler deduced that Batman's real identity

301
00:25:59,068 --> 00:26:04,450
was Bruce Wayne, and he teamed with the villain
Hush to mastermind a plan that nearly drove

302
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:10,373
Batman insane as Bruce Wayne's loved ones were
targeted by nearly every member of his rogue's

303
00:26:10,413 --> 00:26:16,515
gallery. Batman prevailed in the end and reminded
the captured Riddler that a riddle everyone

304
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:22,718
knew the answer to was worthless, ensuring that
the Riddler kept his secret identity. During

305
00:26:22,758 --> 00:26:27,639
the Infinite Crisis storyline, the Riddler joined
the ranks of the Secret Society of Super-Villains,

306
00:26:28,099 --> 00:26:33,041
only to be knocked unconscious and put in a
coma by the hero Shining Knight. Waking up

307
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:39,182
a year later with amnesia, Edward amassed a
small fortune legally as a private investigator,

308
00:26:39,543 --> 00:26:45,084
frequently helping Batman and other heroes solve
crimes for some time, before he was caught

309
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:50,722
in an explosion during a heroic escapade that
re-triggered his psychosis. Whether he's plotting

310
00:26:50,822 --> 00:26:56,444
schemes against Batman, Green Arrow, or even
The Flash, The Riddler is pretty inconsistent

311
00:26:56,464 --> 00:27:01,845
when it comes to success, sometimes failing
in hilarious fashion and other times proving

312
00:27:01,885 --> 00:27:07,367
himself frighteningly capable and underestimated.
While the jury's out on whether or not he's

313
00:27:07,407 --> 00:27:12,849
as intelligent as he claims to be, and though
he has no powers or physical abilities of note,

314
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:19,329
he does have a genius level of intellect. capable
of crafting elaborate death traps and lethal

315
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:25,535
weapons, more likely than not designed around
a question mark motif, like his staff, which

316
00:27:25,575 --> 00:27:31,281
has served successfully as a trigger for various
tricks and snares, and somewhat less successfully

317
00:27:31,761 --> 00:27:36,446
as a combat weapon. That's the Riddler. Yeah,
there were quite a few similarities there.

318
00:27:36,706 --> 00:27:40,550
Two fascinating villains. Let's go ahead and
find out who would win in a fight. Now before

319
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:45,112
we run the simulations, what we'd like to do
on this podcast is kind of improvise a scenario

320
00:27:45,212 --> 00:27:49,495
and talk about how we think one of these 1000
simulated battles would actually play out.

321
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:53,377
We don't set any rules for this battle, save
for the fact that the characters don't know

322
00:27:53,477 --> 00:27:57,539
anything about each other when they first meet,
other than that the other one is a threat that

323
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:02,442
needs to be put down. And the fight takes place
in an environment that plays no bearing on

324
00:28:02,462 --> 00:28:07,525
the match itself. In a non-environment, as it
were. Now these rules would normally apply

325
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:13,299
to our duel episodes. However, this one, we're
taking a different approach. This improvised

326
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:17,800
scenario is not actually 100% improvised. Since
these characters fight more with their brains

327
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,761
than with their fists, we did a little bit of
prep work and you'll see what I mean as we

328
00:28:22,781 --> 00:28:27,003
get into it. So the characters start off 50
yards apart from each other on a non-environment

329
00:28:27,023 --> 00:28:36,105
field. Who goes first? The Riddler. Okay. Right
away he goes, riddle me this. So obviously

330
00:28:36,145 --> 00:28:40,684
these characters, like, They don't really fight
hand to hand. So we figure that what they'll

331
00:28:40,764 --> 00:28:45,507
end up doing is they'll end up talking it out
basically and try to figure out exactly which

332
00:28:45,547 --> 00:28:52,072
of them is smarter. Now to that end, both Jonathan
and I have prepared riddles for each other

333
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:57,396
and logic puzzles to kind of simulate this battle
of the minds, if you will. So the characters,

334
00:28:57,716 --> 00:29:02,659
they sit down next to each other. Arcade pulls
out these taser discs that he usually uses

335
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,651
to strap onto victims that he's luring into
murder world. and he straps a taser disc onto

336
00:29:07,691 --> 00:29:13,095
himself and to the Riddler, and the scenario
is this. The characters each have to answer

337
00:29:13,195 --> 00:29:19,080
five riddles. Whoever gets the most incorrect
gets zapped and electrocuted and dies. And

338
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,643
that's how the speculation is gonna play out.
This is already gonna be a horrible speculation.

339
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:28,067
I am nowhere near as intelligent as the Riddler.
I'm nervous, I'm super nervous about this.

340
00:29:28,248 --> 00:29:33,932
For Arcade, I didn't develop riddles so much
as theme existing logic puzzles to the X-Men

341
00:29:33,952 --> 00:29:39,131
characters. Riddles, some of them actually are
riddles that the Riddler has actually used

342
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:43,234
in the comics. Uh-huh. Not all of them, but
hopefully they're clever enough to stump you.

343
00:29:43,654 --> 00:29:49,557
Okay, so let's get into it. Okay, okay, okay.
Riddle me this. Alright. It holds most knowledge

344
00:29:49,657 --> 00:29:55,800
that's ever been said, but is not the brain
and is not the head. To feathers, they're masters,

345
00:29:56,141 --> 00:30:03,585
both bane and boon, respectively when empty
and when full. The feathers make me think it's

346
00:30:03,605 --> 00:30:11,530
like a quill. Is it a pen? No. Is it a book?
No. No, close though. Is it a bookshelf? No.

347
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:17,474
How many answers do you get? As many as I fucking
need. I'm not as smart as Arcade, okay? Is

348
00:30:17,534 --> 00:30:23,338
it, so it's close to a book? Okay, is it a piece
of paper? Yeah. Is it a letter? Yeah. There

349
00:30:23,358 --> 00:30:31,023
you go. It's paper. Paper. Okay, awesome. Yeah,
writers use like feathered cool pens and you

350
00:30:31,043 --> 00:30:35,578
know, when the page is full of writing, it's
good. And when it's empty, it's not. Okay,

351
00:30:35,598 --> 00:30:39,840
yeah, that's what I figured. Yeah, after like
five tries. I thought it was like when the

352
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:44,783
pen was full of ink as opposed to when the pen
was empty. Nah, anyway, Arcade does not get

353
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:49,826
zapped because I got the answer right. Oh gosh.
Now, okay, now Arcade has a puzzle for the

354
00:30:49,866 --> 00:30:57,130
Riddler. At 9 a.m. multiple men caught a cold
and began sneezing at the start of every minute.

355
00:30:58,051 --> 00:31:04,154
Every time he sneezed, he created a duplicate
of himself with the same exact cold. and each

356
00:31:04,214 --> 00:31:10,455
time a duplicate sneezed, it created its own
duplicate. At exactly 9.06 a.m., his apartment

357
00:31:10,475 --> 00:31:17,317
was half full of dupes. At what time will his
apartment be completely full? That's an easy

358
00:31:17,437 --> 00:31:23,259
one. I mean, if he's doubling every minute and
then at 9.06, his apartment is half full, it

359
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:29,140
means at 9.07, it will be full. Correct. You're
right. Whatever. It was an easy one. It was

360
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:33,978
an easy one. Yeah. The number of multiple men
doubles each minute. Therefore you can say

361
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:40,002
that at 9-07 his apartment is full, being half
full the previous minute. Okay, I don't get

362
00:31:40,022 --> 00:31:45,886
zapped either then. Yay. Alright. Riddle me
this. Okay. I'm always moving forward, never

363
00:31:45,966 --> 00:31:54,112
looking back. My end limit, no one knows. More
of me, they lack. Like a river, I do flow.

364
00:31:54,472 --> 00:32:01,417
Like a bird, I fly. Now go on and take a guess.
What, say you, am I? It's either a clock or

365
00:32:01,537 --> 00:32:08,484
time. Motherfucker. Time, yeah it's time. Time?
Yeah, that makes sense. Cause time flies, it

366
00:32:08,524 --> 00:32:13,087
always goes forward, you can never go back in
time. That was an easy one. Okay, yeah, I guess

367
00:32:13,107 --> 00:32:18,810
so. You're right, it was an easy one. I wanted
it to be easy. Alright, alright, next puzzle

368
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:25,794
for the Riddler. The villain Toad is stuck in
a muddy hole 100 feet deep and is trying to

369
00:32:25,854 --> 00:32:33,378
get out. Every minute he jumps up 25 feet but
slides down 24 feet. How long does it take

370
00:32:33,478 --> 00:32:38,720
Toad to leap out the hole? Oh, this is like
the frog in the well. Yes, except it's Toad

371
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:42,982
in the hole as opposed to a frog in a well.
Okay, ah, math, okay. It's not that hard of

372
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:53,166
math. Essentially, he's going up a foot a minute?
Correct. Okay, but by 75 minutes, 75 minutes,

373
00:32:53,226 --> 00:32:58,208
right? Because 75 minutes, all he'll need is
one more jump. Oh, so 76 minutes. Correct,

374
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:04,680
as 76 minutes or an hour and 16 minutes. Will
take him up to a height of 76 feet at which

375
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,943
point when he leaps he'll leap 25 feet as usual
He'll leap out of the hole and you won't slide

376
00:33:08,963 --> 00:33:13,466
back down nice Always worried for a second I
was gonna do the math on that one right a lot

377
00:33:13,506 --> 00:33:16,869
of people say it'll take him a hundred minutes
for that one and Calculating the one foot per

378
00:33:16,909 --> 00:33:20,731
minute thing, but they don't think about that
last jump. Yeah, okay good Thank you. You're

379
00:33:20,751 --> 00:33:24,514
doing pretty well so far. Okay. I'm trying to
stump you. I'm trying Let's see if I could

380
00:33:24,534 --> 00:33:30,722
do it with this next one riddle me this okay
when I'm quick. I am deadly A rock, shell,

381
00:33:30,762 --> 00:33:38,528
and bone medley. As a man, I'd make you dream
nearby ocean, sea, and stream. Rock, shell,

382
00:33:38,588 --> 00:33:43,712
and bone medley. Makes me think it's like a
wave or something, but what makes you dream?

383
00:33:44,312 --> 00:33:50,316
Sleep? Like what puts you to sleep? Like laying
by the ocean puts you to sleep? No? Is that?

384
00:33:51,217 --> 00:33:59,086
Sandman! Sand! Oh, mother- Yes. Sand? Yeah,
it's sand. Yeah! I was worried about that third

385
00:33:59,106 --> 00:34:02,469
line as I was reading it. I was like, oh, this
is too easy. Yeah, that kind of gives it away.

386
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:06,111
The whole as a man I make you sleep thing. That's
really the whole riddle. Yeah. Yeah, that's

387
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:13,696
the whole riddle right there. All right. So
next puzzle for the Riddler. You are Nightcrawler.

388
00:34:14,117 --> 00:34:20,181
You are trying to save Juggernaut, Deadpool
and a Chimichanga from the roof of a burning

389
00:34:20,241 --> 00:34:26,225
building. You have to teleport all three to
the safety of the street below, but you can

390
00:34:26,285 --> 00:34:31,841
only teleport. one at a time. Now you can't
leave Deadpool all alone with the chimichanga

391
00:34:32,242 --> 00:34:37,146
because he'll eat it. You can't leave Juggernaut
all alone with Deadpool because he'll rip Deadpool

392
00:34:37,186 --> 00:34:43,511
to shreds. Now in what sequence can you safely
teleport all three from the burning building

393
00:34:43,731 --> 00:34:47,474
to the street? Can't you just have Deadpool
eat the chimichanga? What's wrong with him

394
00:34:47,554 --> 00:34:51,017
eating the- You have to save the chimichanga,
that's part of the rules of the puzzle. You

395
00:34:51,037 --> 00:34:55,221
have to save the Juggernaut, Deadpool, and the
chimichanga from the burning building through

396
00:34:55,241 --> 00:34:59,865
teleportation. Okay. Again, you can only teleport
one at a time and you can't leave Deadpool

397
00:34:59,925 --> 00:35:04,088
alone with either the chimichanga and you can't
leave him alone with the juggernaut. Okay.

398
00:35:04,128 --> 00:35:09,433
So what's the sequence? Okay, so like okay,
so juggernaut is not gonna eat the chimichanga?

399
00:35:09,613 --> 00:35:16,259
Correct, right. Yeah, he's safe with the chimichanga.
Okay. Okay, so Nightcrawler will teleport Deadpool

400
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:24,025
first and then go back for juggernaut. Okay.
Okay, so then he takes juggernaut across the

401
00:35:24,045 --> 00:35:28,732
street. But he could take Deadpool back to the
burning building, right? Correct. Yes. OK.

402
00:35:28,892 --> 00:35:32,614
Well, then he takes Deadpool back to the burning
building, grabs the chimichanga, goes back

403
00:35:32,654 --> 00:35:37,056
across the street, leaves the chimichanga with
Juggernaut and then goes back for Deadpool

404
00:35:37,316 --> 00:35:41,399
and brings him back across the street. So all
are safe now. Yep. You got it. You got it.

405
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,841
Fuck. I thought that would be a hard one. It's
just it's just a lot. It takes a lot of back

406
00:35:45,861 --> 00:35:49,783
and forth. Yeah. Basically, if you just remember
that Juggernaut is safe with the chimichanga,

407
00:35:50,024 --> 00:35:54,446
then you kind of work from there. Yeah. Then
it's pretty straightforward. Yeah. Alright,

408
00:35:54,686 --> 00:36:02,030
next. Riddle me this. Reaching stiffly for the
sky, I bare my fingers when it's cold. In warmth,

409
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:11,055
I wear an emerald glove, and in between I dress
in gold. Uh, reach gloved hands to the cold

410
00:36:11,115 --> 00:36:17,699
sky? Yeah, dressing in green and gold. Yes.
In warmth, I wear- Oh, it's a tree! Or a branch.

411
00:36:17,859 --> 00:36:22,758
Okay, alright. Yeah, it's a tree. It's either
a branch or a tree. That one was obvious. Okay.

412
00:36:22,778 --> 00:36:29,043
I suck. These are way easy. The Riddler is a
horrible, horrible deliverer of riddles. Alright,

413
00:36:29,884 --> 00:36:36,350
Riddler's turn. So Mirage, from the New Mutants,
encounters a bear in a wasteland at night,

414
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:42,695
where no one else is around. Mistaking it for
the Demon Bear, Mirage runs away to the north

415
00:36:43,115 --> 00:36:50,718
by 20 yards. The bear runs away to the west
by 30 yards. Suddenly, Mirage stops... She

416
00:36:50,778 --> 00:36:56,982
aims her psionic bow directly south and shoots
the bear with a neural arrow. What color was

417
00:36:57,022 --> 00:37:02,646
the bear? What the fuck? Why does it matter
if she shoots him? She would have missed because

418
00:37:02,686 --> 00:37:07,549
he wasn't there to begin with. She aims directly
south and she shoots him. But he's not there

419
00:37:07,569 --> 00:37:13,493
because he's 30 yards west. That doesn't make
any sense. The question is, what color is the

420
00:37:13,533 --> 00:37:20,082
bear, sir? You never said the color. Brown.
The bear is brown. Bears are brown. BOOM you

421
00:37:20,102 --> 00:37:22,604
just got electrocuted! Riddler just got electrocuted!
Zzzz

422
00:37:49,438 --> 00:37:54,921
You sit-a-lin geometry on me. Yeah, actually
Einstein wrote this riddle. Really? Yeah, except

423
00:37:55,001 --> 00:37:59,305
obviously he didn't use Mirage and the demon
bear, it was just a hunter and a polar bear.

424
00:37:59,885 --> 00:38:07,790
First of all, you said a wasteland. Yeah, the
North Pole's a fucking wasteland. Whatever,

425
00:38:07,991 --> 00:38:16,357
fine. All right, your turn. Yay, I'm winning.
Okay, here we go. Last one, prepare to be electrocuted.

426
00:38:16,897 --> 00:38:22,935
Riddle me this. What's the beginning of eternity,
the end of time and space, the beginning of

427
00:38:23,015 --> 00:38:29,577
every end, and the end of every race? I know
this one. What? I've heard this one before.

428
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:35,158
It's the letter E. Fuck! Right? What? The beginning
of eternity, the end of time and space, time

429
00:38:35,178 --> 00:38:40,140
and space ends with the letter E. The beginning
of every end. Yeah. And the end of every race.

430
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:45,381
Right. Well look at you! I got them all right!
Alright, here's the last puzzle for the Riddler.

431
00:38:46,006 --> 00:38:53,148
Beast is developing a chemical solution to power
the X-Jet with alternative fuels. His new formula

432
00:38:53,468 --> 00:39:00,750
calls for exactly 4 liters of liquid nitrogen.
The problem is he only has an unmarked 5 liter

433
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:07,992
Erlenmeyer flask and an unmarked 3 liter Erlenmeyer
flask. How can he use these flasks to measure

434
00:39:08,092 --> 00:39:13,522
out the 4 liters of liquid that he needs? Why
are all of yours involving math? That's what

435
00:39:13,542 --> 00:39:19,286
I want to know. This is barely math. It's like
elementary addition and subtraction math. Okay.

436
00:39:19,306 --> 00:39:27,071
Yeah. So they're unmarked flasks and he needs
four liters. Right. Did you ever see Die Hard

437
00:39:27,091 --> 00:39:30,914
with a Vengeance? This puzzle was in that movie.
Oh yeah? Yeah. Awesome, I should have seen

438
00:39:30,934 --> 00:39:40,041
the movie. I know how to do it. I would fill
up the five liter flask. Uh-huh. And then I

439
00:39:40,061 --> 00:39:44,254
would empty three of the liters. into the three
liter flask. Right, you'd fill that three liter

440
00:39:44,274 --> 00:39:47,895
flask up. Right, all the way to the top. So
I would, I know I would have two liters in

441
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:53,337
the five liter flask. Right. And three liters
in the three liter flask. Correct. So I just

442
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:58,418
need to figure out how to get rid of the one
and the three liter. Well, where's the nitrogen

443
00:39:58,458 --> 00:40:03,460
coming from? It's coming from a liquid nitrogen
tank. You can pour liquid out too, is all I'm

444
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:08,261
saying. Just dump it on the floor, you know.
He has an unlimited supply of liquid nitrogen.

445
00:40:08,861 --> 00:40:16,499
Okay, that's good to know. Okay, so I still
have five liters. I'll empty out the three

446
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:22,500
liter flask, put the two liters that I still
have in the five liter flask into the three

447
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:28,262
liter flask. Right? So it's one liter away from
being full. Correct. And there's nothing in

448
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:33,363
the five liter flask now. Right. Okay, well
then I'll just fill up the five liter flask

449
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:40,025
and then empty one liter of it into the three
liter flask. So I have four left over in the

450
00:40:40,065 --> 00:40:43,943
five. and I'll just dump whatever's in the three
liter flask. And you have your four liter right

451
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:51,565
there. Boom, boom. You got it. I'm smart, dude.
All I know is that we've come to the end of

452
00:40:51,605 --> 00:40:56,086
the riddles and the puzzles and the Riddler
was the only one that got any of these questions

453
00:40:56,126 --> 00:41:02,408
wrong. So guess what? Arcade presses his trigger
and the Riddler gets zapped and electrocuted

454
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:08,842
until he dies. Yeah, except that the Riddler
used a reverse frequency. Analyzer on his cane

455
00:41:08,982 --> 00:41:14,144
what to redirect the frequency to arcade and
he got electrocuted He doesn't have a sucker.

456
00:41:14,204 --> 00:41:20,587
It's a reverse frequency Versus transmission
frequencies shut up. That's cheating. No. Yeah,

457
00:41:20,607 --> 00:41:24,969
that's fine. Well, okay the river cheats Well,
he cheats all the time. Yes What little did

458
00:41:24,989 --> 00:41:30,792
you know that arcade wouldn't dare risk putting
an electrified taser disc on his own body?

459
00:41:31,172 --> 00:41:36,090
Not knowing whether or not he would know the
answers and get out of this alive. So He actually

460
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:39,813
just projected a hologram of himself right there.
That was a hologram that was answering these

461
00:41:39,853 --> 00:41:43,937
questions. In reality, Arcade's been standing
behind Riddler this whole time, and he just

462
00:41:43,977 --> 00:41:49,201
shoots him with a gun. Oh yeah? Yeah. Well,
little did you know that the Riddler noticed

463
00:41:49,221 --> 00:41:54,386
that Arcade was a hologram through his powers
of deduction, and he knew that the real one

464
00:41:54,406 --> 00:41:59,250
was probably up behind him. What? So before
Arcade could fire that gun, the Riddler spins

465
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:03,738
around in his chair and uses his cane to knock
the gun out of Arcade's hand. Alright, okay,

466
00:42:03,758 --> 00:42:06,861
so now this is just like a full-on brawl then,
eh? Let's do it! We're not fighting with our

467
00:42:06,881 --> 00:42:11,104
brains anymore? Come at me, bro. So, Arcade
lunges at Riddler and pounces on him, knocks

468
00:42:11,124 --> 00:42:15,408
him off his chair, and starts choking the shit
out of him. How are you gonna choke someone

469
00:42:15,708 --> 00:42:20,813
with a long metal cane, who's hitting you in
the head? Well, Arcade gets hit in the head

470
00:42:20,853 --> 00:42:25,457
and he rolls away, and then... No, he's out.
He's been knocked unconscious. No, no, you

471
00:42:25,477 --> 00:42:30,341
know, he's concussed. He's not unconscious.
But he, like, throws up his fist, and like

472
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:35,317
this hard light... holographic like boxing glove
on a spring shoots out and punches Riddler

473
00:42:35,337 --> 00:42:40,582
in the face knocking him out cold. Hard light?
Yeah, it's Shiar technology. Okay, well if

474
00:42:40,622 --> 00:42:45,686
Arcade isn't knocked unconscious with the cane,
the Riddler isn't with the boxing glove. That's

475
00:42:45,726 --> 00:42:50,450
fair I guess. And then the Riddler pulls out
a gun and shoots Arcade in the face. Except

476
00:42:50,510 --> 00:42:57,456
Arcade leaps out of the way and he starts flying
using these air stepper shoes that he has,

477
00:42:57,496 --> 00:43:02,879
or he can like walk on air. What the fuck is
this shit? Yeah, he has those. And then he

478
00:43:02,899 --> 00:43:07,161
just drops a bomb onto the Riddler. Okay well
as the bomb is dropping, that's when the Riddler

479
00:43:07,181 --> 00:43:14,284
is like, RIDDLE ME THIS! I see without seeing.
To me, darkness is as clear as daylight. What

480
00:43:14,324 --> 00:43:19,847
am I? Arcade says who gives a shit, and then
Riddler blows up. A bat! And so he swings his

481
00:43:19,887 --> 00:43:26,214
cane like a bat, knocking the bomb back at Arcade.
You got that riddle from Batman Forever. It

482
00:43:26,234 --> 00:43:32,157
was the only thing I could come up with at the
last minute for a bat. Okay, so allegedly this

483
00:43:32,197 --> 00:43:38,440
is the type of bomb that could be batted upwards
Yes. and still not explode. Whatever. We'll

484
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:43,782
end our improvised scenario there where either
Arcade gets blown up with his own bomb or the

485
00:43:43,822 --> 00:43:47,964
Riddler gets blown up with Arcade's bomb. And
we'll go ahead and run the simulations and

486
00:43:48,004 --> 00:43:49,965
find out which of these characters wins this
match.

487
00:43:54,798 --> 00:44:00,603
Alright, as much as I wanted that to be a battle
of minds, you made it devolve into a battle

488
00:44:00,703 --> 00:44:05,647
of fists in the end. What? Yeah, with your transmitter
reversal device. They had to start punching

489
00:44:05,667 --> 00:44:10,392
each other because they couldn't electrocute
each other. Now intelligence wise, these guys

490
00:44:10,552 --> 00:44:15,196
are probably on par with each other. Now I would
say that Riddler has a higher success rate

491
00:44:15,256 --> 00:44:20,301
in the comics than Arcade. However Arcade frequently
goes up against more powerful heroes than I

492
00:44:20,321 --> 00:44:25,204
would say the Riddler does. For the most part,
the Riddler usually sticks to Gotham City in

493
00:44:25,424 --> 00:44:30,346
Batman, but he's taken his gig to Central City
to fight the Flash before. That being said,

494
00:44:30,426 --> 00:44:35,149
it's pretty rare. Yeah, the rest of their stats
were also pretty comparable in addition to

495
00:44:35,169 --> 00:44:39,331
their intelligence. It's hard to say exactly
what equipment each of these characters has

496
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:44,254
on them, so we kind of went with what you could
consider default weapons. For Riddler, it included

497
00:44:44,294 --> 00:44:49,917
his cane, as well as some question mark flashbangs
and a gun, a pistol. Arcade, that was even

498
00:44:49,977 --> 00:44:55,139
harder. but we assume that he had some kind
of holographic image inducer, maybe some explosives,

499
00:44:55,660 --> 00:45:01,142
maybe a gun. So that being said, we figured
Arcade could probably deliver a higher damage

500
00:45:01,202 --> 00:45:06,244
level than Riddler at any average given moment.
Correct, because basically he's just dealing

501
00:45:06,264 --> 00:45:11,026
with technology that's a little bit more advanced
than Riddler typically works with. Right. But

502
00:45:11,066 --> 00:45:14,427
in terms of like, you know, strength, speed,
durability... They're average. They're not

503
00:45:14,467 --> 00:45:19,914
typically lifting weights, you know? The only
things these guys are lifting are... Pencils

504
00:45:19,934 --> 00:45:25,195
to fill out their Sudoku. Right, exactly. Alright,
so who do you think won between these two characters?

505
00:45:25,795 --> 00:45:30,977
I'm pretty convinced it's Arcade. Just because
of the few stats where he ranks higher than

506
00:45:30,997 --> 00:45:37,159
the Red Lurin, namely damage and evasiveness,
we figured that his holograms would make him

507
00:45:37,179 --> 00:45:42,120
a little bit more tricky with his illusion casting
and possible force field generation. Right,

508
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:46,821
again it all comes down to the toys that they're
using at the moment. So that being said...

509
00:45:47,266 --> 00:45:55,512
The winner of the Riddler vs Arcade is... You're
correct, it's Arcade. What a cheater! Arcade

510
00:45:55,692 --> 00:46:04,499
won 651 matches out of the 1000 simulations.
The Riddler only won 349. So it wasn't that

511
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:10,004
close of a match. No, I'm not surprised. When
one character is higher than another character,

512
00:46:10,304 --> 00:46:14,868
even if it's by a little bit in multiple stats,
it's gonna skew the results in their favor.

513
00:46:15,348 --> 00:46:23,243
By skew, you mean... totally stop, totally annihilate.
What a cheater. Totally win. I'm just in character

514
00:46:23,263 --> 00:46:30,546
right now, what a cheater. That does it for
this episode. Arcade beats Riddler 65.1% of

515
00:46:30,566 --> 00:46:34,467
the time. Go ahead and reach out to us guys,

522
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:07,626
In our next episode, we will be reviewing an
X-Men film, since we're kind of on the theme

523
00:47:07,646 --> 00:47:12,290
of X-Men with the villain, Arcade. We're gonna
be reviewing an earlier X-Men movie. X-Men

524
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:16,433
Days of Future Past, which I think is one of
the better X-Men films. It's definitely one

525
00:47:16,453 --> 00:47:20,917
of the more interesting and it's certainly novel
in the way that the two X-Men generation casts

526
00:47:21,317 --> 00:47:25,381
kind of meet together in this one movie. So
really looking forward to talking about that

527
00:47:25,421 --> 00:47:29,104
film. Go ahead and watch it again if you guys
