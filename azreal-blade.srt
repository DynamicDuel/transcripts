00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:27,180
Hi, welcome to the Dynamic Duel podcast where we
review superhero films and debate the

2
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:31,520
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in crossover battle

3
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:37,840
simulations. I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin
brother Marvelous Joe. And this episode, our main

4
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:45,220
event is Azrael vs. Blade. Yeah, we know that we
wanted to review Blade in our next episode with the

5
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,560
countdown to the Black Panther movie coming out.
We thought it would be a good idea to give homage to

6
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:55,820
the character that kind of not only started the
whole modern wave of superhero films, but also was

7
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,120
one of the first leading Black superhero
characters to start in a film. Yeah. And you know,

8
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,040
putting him against Azrael, I don't think most
people would have thought of this match. It was so

9
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,280
hard. Like, I spent the longest time trying to
convince you that Constantine was the best

10
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,880
matchup for Blade. The worst match ever. There's
no way Blade would stand. Blade would not even

11
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:22,280
touch Constantine. If you say so, I disagree with
that. But I think I ended up googling like DC

12
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,900
superheroes that carry swords or something like
that. I saw a cool image of Azrael Yeah. hearing the

13
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:33,100
sword. So I was like, oh, that might work. I hadn't
even thought of Azrael. And well, Azrael kind of

14
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:39,340
has he has like a pseudo supernatural, more
religious background. Yeah. So it's kind of

15
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:45,460
comparable. And because Blade is a supernatural
hero. So I think it works. Yeah. I mean, you know,

16
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:51,260
Azrael, he's strong and faster than the usual.
He's super human is what I'm saying, along with the

17
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:56,060
blade. Yeah. So you know, Blade was always like
this really, really like unique character. And so

18
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:02,140
when you when you suggested Azrael, I was like, why
didn't I think of that? So that's what we're doing.

19
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:06,820
I think we're also thinking like Zeriel for a
while. But it was really hard to get information on

20
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:13,140
him. Zeriel, the angel who Zario Zario. How do you
say it? I see Zario. He was an angel character that

21
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,620
was featured in the Justice League of America
during Grant Morrison's run. I thought that might

22
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,820
be a good matchup too. But I like this one better.
Dude, Zeriel would have stopped Blade, not even a

23
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:29,040
good match. All right. If you say so, man, I
disagree. But before we get into the match, we like

24
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,740
to do the news breakdown. There's no DC news. Good.
This episode sucks the way I like it. All Marvel all

25
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:41,560
the time. So Logan gets an Oscar nomination for
best adapted screenplay. Wonder Woman gets a

26
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:47,380
snub. We'll be talking about that. Hans Zimmer
comes out of retirement to score X-Men Dark

27
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,660
Phoenix. That's cool. There's a new set photo and
video that gives us our first look at Captain

28
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,640
Marvel. Brie Larson is Captain Marvel. Yeah,
there's a ton of like internet outrage. There's a

29
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,040
reading talk about that. We're going to get into
that. And that's that's pretty much all the news

30
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:08,260
there is. It's kind of a slow news week. A little
bit. It's not too bad for Marvel. But up next, let's

31
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:14,460
talk about the no prize. Yeah. So last week, our
question of the week was, which Marvel or DC

32
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:21,220
television series do you think had the strongest
pilot episode? No one chose my favorite. No one.

33
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,240
Well, actually, a few people chose my favorite.
But I think the most interesting answer and the

34
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:31,920
winner of the no prize for this week is John Spees,
who gave the answer. He said, I think the X-Men

35
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,200
animated series had the best pilot. Yeah, I didn't
even consider like any animated series. No, yeah,

36
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,600
when I was thinking about this question. But I
recently watched the X-Men animated series

37
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,740
again, because we actually, we did a guest spot on
John's podcast, which is the blast from our past

38
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,820
podcast, which is an amazing show that they put on.
If you haven't listened to it yet, super nostalgia

39
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,840
feels. Yeah, check out the blast from our past
podcast. They talk about all the cool stuff that we

40
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,440
enjoyed as kids in the early nineties and late
eighties. So but I will rewatch the X-Men animated

41
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:11,000
cartoon and that pilot episode did such a good job
of setting up the themes of the show. Like it wasn't

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:18,060
afraid to get deep, but it had tremendous action.
And I think it did a great job introducing these

43
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:23,220
iconic characters in a way that made it so
palatable to the mainstream audience. Like that

44
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:29,260
show was heavily inspired by the early nineties,
Jim Lee and Claremont Run. Yeah. Yeah, I think that

45
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:33,260
was a great answer. It's definitely one of the
strongest pilots that has ever been produced.

46
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:39,460
Yeah. So John will be getting the no prize. But what
was your favorite pilot? I think my answer to this

47
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:45,060
question, I think everybody who has listened to
this podcast for a while knows that I'm a huge fan of

48
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:52,540
the Legion TV show that came out early last year.
And I think that pilot episode drew me in in a way

49
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:58,940
that nothing else did. I was I was so concerned that
the Legion show was going to be such a radical

50
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:04,700
departure from the comics. And it was, but it made
it so interesting that I was compelled to keep

51
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:11,100
watching. And I just loved every episode as much as
the first almost. So yeah, that has to be my answer.

52
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,800
I've seen the pilot. It was good. But I didn't like
it as much as I liked Smallville's pilot.

53
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,440
Smallville had a great pilot back in the day. That
was the one that ended with like the tornado in the

54
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,700
cornfield. And they like strung him up like a
scarecrow with the kryptonite necklace and they

55
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:28,900
had the the S painted on the chest. But just like
seeing Clark Kent and Lex Luthorin, like I grew up

56
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:34,180
with I was a freshman when Smallville came out. So
like when Clark became a sophomore and I was

57
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:40,040
growing along with him. So I was like, I was the
perfect age for that show. It was a good one. I mean,

58
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,600
I think I stopped watching after the second or
third season because it kind of became apparent

59
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,000
that they were never going to show him become
Superman. And the way that show ended. They never

60
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:56,760
really did. Yeah, it's so stupid. I think I stopped
after like season five. I stuck with it for a while.

61
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:00,980
I just like every episode I just want to like after
the third season, I was like, just shut up Lana. I

62
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:06,080
just like to the concept of it. Like it was like, you
know, the meteorites coming with Superman to

63
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,200
Earth, the kryptonite meteorites and the
radiation from those creating weekly villain of

64
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,500
the week villain of the weeks. It was, you know, it
may not work now, but it totally worked on me then.

65
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,620
Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, I had had good
action to get special effects. Yeah, great kind of

66
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,560
portrayal of the powers that he did have like with
X-ray vision and the heat vision and all that

67
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,580
stuff. Yeah, it was a good show for a while. Yeah.
And then I sucked. I don't know. I know. But yeah, I

68
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,360
stopped watching. I agree. Great pilot episode
for sure. Yeah, I know I was hooked on that one too.

69
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,620
And I'm not even a DC guy. So that that's a testament
to how good it was. Yeah. All right, so we'll be

70
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,220
asking another question later on in the show
during our news segment. So keep an eye out for that

71
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:55,180
if you want to win that note prize for our next
episode. Yep. So on to the news segment. Logan. No,

72
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:00,580
the real news here is that Wonder Woman was
snubbed. No, I think the real news is that Logan is

73
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:08,080
the first comic book movie to be nominated for the
Best Adapted Screenplay Award. Which? So it's

74
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,680
going to go to, I think James Mangold wrote the
script. Really? Yeah. He also co-wrote it with

75
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:19,920
writers named Scott Frank and Michael Green. So if
they win, it would mean so much to the comic book

76
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:25,360
genre, I think as a whole. Yeah. Because it's not
like a technical award or like a makeup award like

77
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:32,140
Suicide Squad 1. Right. It's a testament to how
strong the story was. Right. Honestly, this is the

78
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:38,840
one category of Oscars that I'm sorry. I've always
wanted a comic book film to be nominated. And to

79
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,200
win. Besides the best picture. Well, besides the
best picture, I think the biggest award a comic

80
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,960
book film has really won was, you know, Best
Supporting Actor for Heath Ledger. That's

81
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,040
definitely like, I think, like the most
prestigious. But again, that's not really

82
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,980
commenting on someone's performance rather than
like the source material and giving legitimacy to

83
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:02,300
the source material. Or the adapted material.
Right. Yeah, I agree. I agree. I think this, if it

84
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:07,760
wins, it can mean so much because I feel like
there's a slight sense of superhero fatigue out

85
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:13,480
there, especially I felt it a lot like around when
Justice League was just released. And I like when

86
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:18,560
people come down on superhero movies, one of their
criticisms is that maybe there's too many of these

87
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,600
being made or something like that. So good
superhero movies can only, you know, benefit the

88
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:28,520
genre as a whole. And especially when they win
awards, that they can only mean positive things.

89
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:35,419
And I think that if it wins an award, we'll see maybe
more movies being made like Logan in the future.

90
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:39,860
Yeah, I'm not sure. Well, what is it going up
against? Oh, that's a good question. It's going up

91
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:47,900
against adapted screenplay. Let's see. Call me by
your name. Donut. The Disaster Artist. Oh, no,

92
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:53,860
that Molly's game. He sort of know that. I've heard
that one was written by Aaron Sorkin. Sure. I heard

93
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,960
that was really good. And the last one was
Mudbound. So like I would have to, I'd probably

94
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:05,780
give Logan like the number two seed in this list. It
might go to Molly's game, which would suck because

95
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:10,320
I mean, well, Aaron Sorkin is really good, but he's
won Academy Awards before. So it would be cool to

96
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,740
see these guys win. You know what the sucky thing is
though, even if it wins this award, what can they do

97
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:21,120
with that? Because, you know, Disney is about to
own those characters now. Plus, like Logan is

98
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:25,420
dead. Like you can't really like take that and run
with it into like a sequel. Like I'm sure like

99
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:29,540
someone really would want to, especially with,
you know, like because it's in a franchise. What I

100
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:35,920
mean, unless Marvel wants to hire main gold to do an
X-Men film, which I think would be fantastic. I do,

101
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,860
I think about how the X-Men are going to go into the
Marvel Cinematic Universe all the time. Like I

102
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,840
dream about that. And I was actually, this is a kind
of a tangent off the main topic, but I was thinking

103
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:52,740
in the shower the other day, how are they going to
introduce mutants into the MCU? Yeah, how they'd

104
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:57,700
never been mentioned before. Right. And I kind of
came up with a theory that I don't know if has been

105
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:03,820
already come up somewhere else. It probably has.
But I was thinking, what if mutants have been

106
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:09,140
around in the MCU this entire time? Like they were
there for the Battle of New York with the Avengers

107
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:15,160
and everything like that. But the reason that
nobody remembers them is because Professor X is

108
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:20,920
like neuralizing them like with Cerebro kind of
like in Men of Black how like, Oh, what? Like how Men

109
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:25,240
of Black you can like make people forget with the
neuralizer. Like what if Professor X is doing

110
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,100
something like that? He's just mindwiping
everybody? Just yeah, using Cerebro. He's like,

111
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:36,340
and that's how he keeps the mutants anonymity is by
keeping them safe. So the whole world doesn't know

112
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:44,000
that mutants exist? Right. Yeah. I think it would
be cool if mutants did already exist in the MCU, but

113
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,100
no one knew about them. People would just keep
getting their mind wiped regarding the mutation

114
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,200
and everything like that. And then they would
almost make Professor X a villain. Yeah, but he's

115
00:10:54,200 --> 00:11:01,500
done shady things like that in the past before, you
know? So I think it's not outside of his character.

116
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,380
And then maybe when they're introduced into the
MCU, Professor X is no longer able to hide the

117
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:12,880
existence of mutants because Magneto like
launches like an offensive against mankind or

118
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,820
something. Destroy Cerebro or something like
that or something like that. Yeah. That's not a bad

119
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,940
theory. I'm trying to think of any other way it
could be done. Nope. That's the only acceptable

120
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:29,300
way it could be done. I think it's a great way to kind
of establish them in the history of the MCU, but

121
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:36,600
also introduce them as new characters. Huh. So
we'll see if they end up going that route. But yeah,

122
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,060
I just thought about that in the shower and I was
like, oh, I got to talk about that in But regarding

123
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,260
Logan, I was a little bit disappointed that the
film wasn't nominated for Best Picture because to

124
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,060
me it was like among my favorite films of last year,
not just because it was a Marvel film or because it

125
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:57,540
was a superhero film, but because it was such a good
story. I know that after the the Dark Knight was

126
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:02,840
nominated or wasn't nominated for Best Picture,
like the Academy increased the number of

127
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:09,280
nominees. And I can't remember. I think they went
backwards. I could totally be making that up. But I

128
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,980
remember like it was like checking her some tweets
about this and they were like, oh, you couldn't

129
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:21,520
extend the list again to include Logan? Yeah. You
know. Well, it just feels like the industry has

130
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:28,760
somewhat of a not of a data, but the fact that Logan
didn't get nominated for Best Picture and the fact

131
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,080
that Wonder Woman didn't receive any nominations
when it was recognized by the PGA, the American

132
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:41,200
Film Institute and everything as well. Yeah. It's
just a little bit weird. It seems like the you know,

133
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:49,140
the AFI and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
Sciences and they like they didn't agree this

134
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:55,140
year. No, not really. I think it's almost like
Hollywood is trying to send a message to everybody

135
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:01,900
that they don't want more superhero films being
made. Yeah. Yeah. It doesn't matter how good you

136
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:08,920
make them because we're not going to recognize
them anyway. It sucks because I don't foresee any

137
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:15,700
movies this year coming out that are like more
impactful than Logan. Maybe Aqua Man. Maybe. No.

138
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:22,000
Definitely not. You don't know. I was gonna say
maybe Infinity War. I don't know. I did it. We'll

139
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,540
see. So you're feeling bad about Wonder Woman
though? I can't do. Okay. That's all that matters

140
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:31,040
to me. Moving on to the next news item. It should
have been nominated for Best Director. What? It

141
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,740
should have been nominated for Best Actress.
Should have been nominated for Best Picture.

142
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:38,800
Should have been nominated for Best Supporting
Actor. Should have been nominated for Best

143
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,380
Screenplay. Should have been nominated for...
This is not the Jonathan Fantasy Awards. This is

144
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,780
the Academy Awards. Dude. It should have been
nominated in each one of those categories. I don't

145
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:55,100
think so man. Alright. Moving on to the next bit of
news. Hans Zimmer who has apparently stated

146
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:59,920
before that he was not going to score any more
superhero films. Yeah. He's going to score X-Men

147
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,100
Dark Phoenix. Which is... Yeah. So apparently
he's only done with DC films. Thanks a lot Hans

148
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,900
Zimmer. What the fuck? He... I think he's done
great work on Man of Steel and of course the Dark

149
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:15,700
Knight trilogy. So this is great news for X-Men
because I don't think that they've had a

150
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:22,300
particularly strong score in any of their films.
Maybe X-Men 2. I think John Ottoman's score in

151
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:29,980
X-Men 2 was pretty well done. It was like... Oh
yeah. Yeah. But I mean they kind of reused those

152
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,900
themes in both Days of Future Past and X-Men
Apocalypse and the other films just weren't that

153
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:40,820
memorable. Yeah. I didn't like the score at all for
X-Men Apocalypse. No. Yeah. So the fact that it's

154
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:46,080
going to at least have more memorable music
registers more on my radar a little bit more. I mean

155
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:53,760
I could listen to the Man of Steel soundtrack all
day. Just all day. Just had headphones on and just

156
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,760
listened to that all day. It's so good. It's really
good. I thought the Dark Knight score was better.

157
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:05,360
What he did with Batman was good too. I don't know.
Hans Zimmer to me right now is like the best

158
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,560
composer and I know like a lot of people would argue
John Williams because he's definitely had like

159
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:20,160
the most iconic and most memorable scores. Yeah.
But to me like technical wise I think I have to give

160
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,860
it to Hans Zimmer. He's done more interesting
things I think than John Williams. John Williams

161
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:30,300
scores are definitely memorable and classic but
it seems like Hans Zimmer is slightly more

162
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:37,160
experimental and yeah I don't know. It's just it
appeals to me in a more unique way. Yeah. This is I

163
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,960
mean this is great news for the for the X-Men
franchise but I mean again it's like are you going

164
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:49,100
to be able to reuse those themes? I think I would not
want them to because I think if you're watching the

165
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:54,040
new MCU X-Men you're going to associate those
themes especially if they're memorable Hans

166
00:15:54,040 --> 00:16:00,880
Zimmer themes to the old shitty X-Men universe.
Yeah. So yeah. All right moving on to the next set of

167
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,160
news. This is probably the biggest news item of the
week. We got our first glimpse through a series of

168
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:13,120
set photos of Brie Larson suited up in her Captain
Marvel superhero costume. It immediately caught

169
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,460
me off guard when I saw these. Yeah. I texted it to
you. But it only took me like at least 10 seconds to

170
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:23,140
like readjust like oh that's the that's the Cree
uniform. Yeah. I remember I texted you the photo

171
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:31,380
and your response was what? What's that? I mean
we've all seen the concept art that was released

172
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:37,080
during Comic Con last year that shows that she will
have the costume in her traditional colors of red

173
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:43,580
and blue and with the gold holostar in the center.
So this like if you're familiar with the comics

174
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:50,800
when Marvel first came to earth and he's the
character that mentored and became the romantic

175
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:57,040
interest of Carol Danvers. It's going to be Jude
Law in the movie. Jude Law. Yes. His costume was a

176
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:04,240
green Cree army uniform. So I'm pretty sure that
she's wearing his suit or not his suit

177
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,079
specifically but wearing the same that same
thing. Yeah. So this this may be before she like

178
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:15,200
customizes it to not resemble a Cree outfit
anymore and more of her own thing. Yeah. I'm

179
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:21,780
assuming. Yeah. So the design itself is a little
interesting. It does have a few more

180
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:28,099
embellishments than I would have thought it would
have. It looks one way in concept art but in the

181
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:32,780
photo it doesn't quite fit nearly as well as it
should which at first made me think that she was

182
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:39,700
wearing his suit. Oh there's like an abundance of
embellishments like if you rivets some piping

183
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:46,700
kind of. I thought yeah I'm glad to hear I'm not the
only one who thought it didn't fit her that well. I

184
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:52,680
mean not that it needs to be skin tight but like
there's a sizable amount of fabric in the crotch

185
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:59,080
area that is just like what is that just dangling it
so she could she could do her high kicks I guess I

186
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,600
guess but like the design of like where the knee
pads are well they're not actually knee pads to the

187
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,480
top of the shin pads but they look like knee pads so
it makes it look like her legs are like super tiny

188
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:13,000
and everything. It's not the most flattering
design. I have to say I like the top half more than I

189
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,900
like the bottom half like if you just kind of cover
up the bottom half. Yeah that looks pretty good and

190
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:23,120
then you cover up the top half and you just look at
the bottom and it's like what is happening but I

191
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,100
think with the the corrected colors I think
that'll be fine. Because we know that she's

192
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:33,120
appearing in Infinity War and I wouldn't be
surprised if you know she has her normal suit

193
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:39,660
colors in that movie but for this movie maybe she
has green all the way up until almost the end. I

194
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:44,720
wouldn't be surprised. Yeah well because her
movie will be her origin story. Right. There was a

195
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:51,340
brief little set video as well that was released
along with these photos and it didn't really

196
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:56,960
reveal much so it's not it didn't go into spoiler
territory but we did see a man approach her

197
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,940
somewhat threateningly and then he she like grabs
his hand and like crushes it and he like winks and

198
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,300
falls to his knees in pain. Not sure what's going on
there but I thought that was pretty interesting.

199
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:12,060
It seems like I think she's like has a big smile
afterward. I don't know if that's just Rilarzans

200
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:18,420
reaction to like the performance or it's actually
part of the script. Part of the character. Yeah

201
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:22,580
yeah like kind of discovering her powers or
something like that. Yeah I have to say the first

202
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:29,340
thing I thought of when I saw this suit was for a
studio that's trying to distance itself like

203
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:35,180
origin wise from Green Lantern this really
reminded me of like a Green Lantern suit. It's like

204
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:41,440
if you wanted to do that this wasn't the best way to
do that at all. It's almost like a Green Lantern

205
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,540
uniform. One of the actually one of the early
thoughts that I had as well was that this suit was

206
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:51,920
green because they were going to animate part of it
like a green screen kind of effect but then I was

207
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,020
like no that's too Green Lantern they wouldn't do
that but you never know they might but yeah that's

208
00:19:57,020 --> 00:20:03,760
actually an apt criticism is that if they're not
animating over it it somewhat resembles a Green

209
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:10,020
Lantern suit and if they are animating over it then
it somewhat resembles the Green Lantern suit from

210
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,820
the 2011 Green Lantern movie. You know what it
really reminded me of? You know the character

211
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:19,640
Jade, Ellen Scott's daughter. Yes. Ellen Scott is
the first Green Lantern. She still she has like

212
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:26,860
that same like Hollister kind of symbol on hers.
That's what it reminded me of. Oh okay

213
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:32,700
interesting. I think that's all I have to say about
that. I'm just looking forward to seeing more set

214
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:38,100
photos as you know they're taking. I'm interested
in seeing more different looks at the costume

215
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,180
essentially and seeing the costume in its proper
color. Right. That'll be cool. This kind of brings

216
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:54,660
us to our question of the week. The question for
this episode is speaking of costumes who in your

217
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,380
opinion has had the best adapted live action
costume design out of all the Marvel and DC films.

218
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:05,500
So go ahead and write your answer into us by

220
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:17,060
answer at dynamicdualpodcastatgmail.com and
we'll go ahead and pick our favorite answer and

221
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:23,400
draw them a Dynamic Dual No Prize with their name on
it that we post to our social media accounts. Yeah

222
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:28,800
if anyone says Green Lantern they will
immediately be blocked. They will not only be

223
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:34,280
disqualified from winning the No Prize they will
be banished from our social media accounts.

224
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,340
Actually you know what I didn't hate the Green
Lantern costume so it made sense to me the way they

225
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:43,220
approached it because if you're going to create
like this this costume that's made of like you know

226
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:50,180
a green construct a green mental construct yeah
maybe it is made of like a CG energy I don't know I

227
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:56,580
don't know. All right yeah let us know who you guys
think had the best superhero costume and with all

228
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:18,500
that news out of the way let's go all right asriel
versus blade um the fight of the century maybe

229
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:23,560
maybe probably not no probably not I mean it's a
good fight I do think I'm interested in seeing how

230
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:29,480
this one will pan out I like both of these
characters I know very little about asriel so I'm

231
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,780
interested in learning about him and seeing what
makes him so cool because despite only sticking

232
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:40,440
around as the replacement for batman for I don't
know like a year maybe less than that he still kind

233
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:45,720
of shows up every now and then in like the the nerd
consciousness yeah so he's an interesting

234
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,800
character for sure. I mean I didn't know too much
about him either so this was a lot of fun research I

235
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:55,960
think I think he would have been a great match up for
moon night. Really? Yeah once I get down into his

236
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:00,020
his profile description you know they both have
you know they're both you know kind of superhuman

237
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,860
they both have like multiple personalities in a
way um they both you know they're both hooded

238
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:09,800
figures yeah who sometimes were white I guess.
Well you never know eventually maybe way down the

239
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,580
line a few years from now we may get to the asriel
versus moon night match that's that's actually a

240
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:19,700
good idea so. Yeah write it down write it down.
We're gonna forget. So if you haven't listened to

241
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:26,220
to one of our dual episodes before the way this
works is we run a thousand spreadsheet battle

242
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,080
simulations the figures from which are
extrapolated from stat sheets that that we record

243
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:37,780
we we do the the simulations a thousand times which
I think is is sort of a big thing for us. It's an

244
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:41,880
accurate way to do it to get a good answer because I
feel like a lot of other people who do something

245
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:48,260
similar in in a way that you know they only do one
match and the thing is is that there's so many

246
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:53,440
different ways for characters when they're
fighting to win or lose you have to do it so many

247
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,560
times to get you know like an inaccurate result I
think. Yeah in our simulations in our simulations

248
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:03,640
no character wins like 100% of the time. No no. So I
always thought that was pretty neat so it feels

249
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:09,280
very accurate we simulate a thousand times we get
the numbers from the stats that we compile from the

250
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,500
official Marvel power rankings as well as a few
other stats that we uh determine ourselves. Yeah

251
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:20,020
we extrapolate the the DC stats from from those
power rankings. Yes it's math there's it's no bias

252
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:24,700
there's no fan votes you know like the the comic
from the 90s where the winners were decided by

253
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:29,280
votes. Oh yeah that was bullshit. Lobo would have
never lost to Wolverine that's what I'm saying so

254
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:34,880
it's it's nothing like that it's it's science yeah
it's science. Yeah and before we do the 1000

255
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,940
simulations uh before we run those numbers in the
spreadsheet we like to go over the profiles and the

256
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:46,160
powers of each of the contestants involved in the
match as well as speculate on how we think at least

257
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,320
one of those matchups would kind of play out. Yeah
it's always fun yeah we don't talk about

258
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:56,460
environment though uh I think that's one of the
things that's also unique is is you can't really

259
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,760
record environmental stats because it's so
variable one character can win one environment

260
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:06,840
and not in another so it's just we don't we don't do
it. Mm-hmm but before the speculation we do the

261
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:11,160
profile breakdowns so let's I think you it's I
think it's your turn to start. Yeah yep I'll go

262
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:19,420
ahead and uh talk about blade. All right so in 1929
London a pregnant prostitute named Tara Brooks

263
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:24,340
summoned a doctor named Deacon Frost to her
brothel to assist with severe labor

264
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:31,900
complications uh Frost was actually a vampire who
feasted on her blood as she gave birth and in doing

265
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:37,760
so the vampire accidentally passed on certain
enzymes from his saliva through Tara's

266
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:44,160
bloodstream into the child that made him immune to
the effects of a vampire bite and gave him an

267
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:49,460
attunement for sensing the supernatural and a
lengthened lifespan. It is all of the strengths of

268
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:54,820
an out of his weaknesses. No it just gave him those
three powers. Oh so it essentially turned the

269
00:25:54,820 --> 00:26:00,280
child into what's called a dampier. Dampier I
think I'm pronouncing that right which is someone

270
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:05,680
who has been touched but not converted by a
vampire. The other women of the brothel were able

271
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:12,060
to dry frost away before he could kill the child as
well and they named the baby Eric. Eric Brooks and

272
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:16,660
he grew up to be the vampire hunter known as Blade.
Wait that's Blade's real name? Eric Brooks yes.

273
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:23,040
Blade has a real name? Yeah I did not expect Eric
Brooks. It wasn't it's not Wesley Snipes. I was

274
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,660
thinking Wesley Snipes or something cool like
that. Yeah so as a teenager Eric was an orphan

275
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:34,220
living on the streets when he first happened upon a
group of vampires attacking an older man named

276
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:40,840
Jamal Afari. He helped fight them off and saved the
man's life. Afari was actually a lifelong vampire

277
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:46,560
hunter who realized that Eric's special immunity
made him ideal for hunting vampires so he took him

278
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:52,080
under his wing and taught him everything he knew.
Eric's main motivation in learning how to kill

279
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,020
vampires was to avenge his mother's death by
killing the vampire responsible. He called

280
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:03,060
himself Blade after his preferred vampire
killing tools. He used these like teak wooden

281
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:09,640
knives throwing knives to kill vampires. So that
was his goal he was unable to find Deacon Frost

282
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:14,480
however but he ended up teaming up with a small
group of vampire hunters to hunt the ruler and most

283
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:20,740
powerful of all vampires Dracula. The group
succeeded in staking Dracula's heart but his

284
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:26,280
servants were able to resurrect him and he got
revenge by killing the group except for Blade. So

285
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:31,160
he persisted in his fight against Dracula with a
new team of hunters that included Quincy Harker

286
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:37,560
and Rachel Van Helsing who were the descendants of
the characters from Bram Stoker's Dracula novel.

287
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:42,220
Over the years they killed Dracula multiple times
but he kept getting resurrected by his servants

288
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:48,860
and his brides. After a while Blade was probably
just like fuck this shit and decided to return to

289
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:55,080
his original mission of avenging his mother. So to
track Deacon Frost he teamed up with Hannibal King

290
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:01,060
who was a detective that was turned into a vampire
and he was played by Ryan Reynolds in the Blade

291
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:06,940
Trinity movie. That's right. Together they
uncovered a plot by Frost to usurp the title of Lord

292
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:13,800
of the Vampires from Dracula. They battled An army
of frost vampires, but ended up killing him. A few

293
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:19,980
years later, Blade teamed up with Doctor Strange,
Hannibal King, and Frank Drake. Frank Drake is

294
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,940
like an inventor dude with a Ghostbuster proton
pack. It was an energy gun that could affect

295
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:31,340
supernatural entities. I thought he was the
lamest thing ever. But they teamed up with Ghost

296
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:38,380
Rider to fight and defeat Lilith, who is the mother
of all demons and her offspring called the Lilin.

297
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:43,400
So Blade continued his mission to rid the world of
vampires, which brought him to New York to stop his

298
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:49,460
former ally Morbius, who was being controlled by
another vampire at the time. He teamed up with

299
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:55,760
Spider-Man for the fight, but managed to get
bitten by Morbius. Blade had been bitten by

300
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,900
vampires before, but he's immune to any effects,
that's one of his natural abilities. Morbius

301
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:08,000
however, was a different sort of vampire, not one
turned by supernatural means. Morbius is like a

302
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,940
pseudo-vampire created by scientific means when
he tried to cure himself of a blood disorder using

303
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:19,140
the genetic material of vampire bats. That's more
like genetic manipulation than... Yeah, so he's

304
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:26,540
like part vampire bat basically. But when he bit
Blade, it turned him to a daywalker. Meaning he got

305
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:33,120
all of the powers of a traditional vampire, and
none of their weaknesses except for the thirst for

306
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:38,980
blood. He got the thirst. Right. But Spider-Man
was able to fashion a serum for both Blade and

307
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:44,700
Morbius to satiate their thirst and they would
both take it regularly. Spider-Man did that?

308
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:51,260
Yeah. Interesting. Blade eventually met his
father, Lucas Cross, who was still alive and

309
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:57,180
coincidentally turned into a vampire a long time
ago. He captured Blade and told him about a

310
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:03,380
prophecy he was to fulfill that results in all
vampires getting their souls restored. So Cross

311
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:09,620
tried to get Blade to drink the blood of a young girl
as one of the conditions of the prophecy was that he

312
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:15,760
had to drink the blood of a virgin. Blade ended up
escaping, but he ended up fulfilling that part of

313
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,720
the prophecy when he drank the blood of his enemy
Draconus, who turns out was a virgin. But he drank

314
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,060
as blood as a means to drain his powers. So he ends up
fulfilling that part of the prophecy and then he's

315
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:32,180
abducted again by his father and taken to Draconus
Castle to complete the final part of the prophecy.

316
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:37,460
So it turns out that Cross had been tricked by
Dracula into thinking that the prophecy ritual

317
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:43,920
would restore all vampire souls, but what it did
instead was resurrect every vampire that had ever

318
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:49,940
died, effectively resetting Blade's mission
back to zero. That's pretty much it for his

319
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:54,960
backstory highlights. Recently he helped the
X-Men fight off an invasion of their island Haven,

320
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:02,200
though not before Jubilee was bitten and turned
into a vampire. Oh, so dumb. And Blade was also a

321
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:08,100
member of Luke Cage's Avengers team called the
Mighty Avengers for a while. As far as powers go,

322
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:14,340
his vampire bite immunity, his long lifespan, and
his ability to send supernatural creatures,

323
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:19,640
those were all acquired at birth during Deacon
Frost's attack on his mother. His later vampire

324
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:25,620
abilities came from Morbius's unique bite that
gave him the more traditional powers of a vampire,

325
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:30,540
although I've never seen him turn into a bat and
I've never seen him hypnotize people. So it's more

326
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:36,520
like the physical stuff. So Blade has enhanced
strength. He can lift about one ton. He has

327
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:41,920
superhuman speed, especially in fast bursts over
short distances, which he can cover in almost an

328
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:48,500
instant. He has enhanced agility, reflexes,
stamina, and durability. He has an accelerated

329
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:54,760
healing ability that we saw in the movie as well.
Not quite as good as Wolverine's, but still pretty

330
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:00,360
good. I remember seeing this image of him fighting
Wolverine and like Wolverine, like put his claws

331
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:06,000
right through his head and Blade was just smiling.
So it has to be pretty good. Yeah, like Wolverine, I

332
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,300
told him, it's like, you know, it's not as fast as
mine, but it's it's almost there. He also has

333
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:16,340
heightened senses, including eyesight, that
make him an expert marksman and able to see in

334
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:21,800
complete darkness. He's a master martial artist
with expertise in multiple fighting styles and a

335
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:26,900
specialist with bladed weapons, including
swords and throwing knives. He also carries

336
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:32,840
automatic machine pistols loaded with hollow
point garlic filled silver bullets. He does have

337
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:38,160
one weakness. I mentioned it before. It's his
thirst for blood. If he doesn't consume blood or

338
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:45,540
his serum for over the course of a couple of weeks,
he dies. And that's everything about him. Did you

339
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:53,680
learn anything? Does he have an English accent?
Yes, he does. Weird. Weird. Yep. Instead of

340
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:58,620
there's worse things out tonight than vampires.
He says it more like, there's worse things out than

341
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:09,320
vampires. Gov'n'at. I can't do an English accent.
So I was real skill wise and ability wise. He's not

342
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:16,360
too far off from Blade. You'll see. OK, so as real.
Jean Paul Valley was a mild mannered programming

343
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:22,380
student at Gotham University when one night a
masked figure crawled bleeding into his

344
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:28,200
apartment. The figure turned out to be his father
to Jean's surprise. And he had been mortally

345
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,780
wounded fighting demon worshipers as the
assassin slash enforcer for a 500 year old

346
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:42,560
religious secret society known as the Sacred
Order of Saint Dumas. Saint Dumas. And you're

347
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:51,660
sorry. Saint Dumas. With his father's last dying
breaths, he explained to Jean Paul that with his

348
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:59,240
death, Jean Paul was the next in line to become the
order's personal angel of death, as real. Using

349
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:04,420
resources, his father bequeathed him. Jean Paul
traveled to Switzerland and met with the Order of

350
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:10,260
Saint Dumas. There he learned that he was a
genetically modified test tube baby. Whose DNA

351
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:16,880
had been spliced with animals to make him stronger
and faster, among other things. He had also been

352
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:23,300
subtly conditioned and brainwashed unknowingly
his whole life. What kind of animals? It's not

353
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:30,820
specific. OK, so he's like part grizzly bear.
Possibly. OK. So he'd been brainwashed

354
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:35,600
unknowingly his whole life in a process known as
the system. Now, under the system's

355
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:40,300
conditioning, Jean was psychologically
manipulated, not only to serve the will of the

356
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:46,139
Order, but also subconsciously trained to become
a violent fighting machine and perfect assassin.

357
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:50,880
And again, this has been going on his whole life
through the Secret Society. I had no idea. Thanks

358
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:57,120
to the system, it wasn't long before Jean Paul was
ready to don the suit of Azrael. Soon after which,

359
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,620
he came into odds with Bruce Wayne, who had
traveled to Switzerland while investigating the

360
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:07,320
death of Jean Paul's father, Beck and Gotham.
Bruce's investigation led him to a man named

361
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:14,280
Carlton LaHaw, a former acolyte of the Order of St.
Dumas and believed servant of the demon Bisse.

362
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:23,140
Bisse? B-I-I-S. Bish. The same man. This was the
same man who killed Jean Paul's father. The new

363
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:28,700
Azrael was tasked with killing LaHaw, but instead
ended up rescuing Batman while LaHaw seemingly

364
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:35,680
died. Aware of Bruce Wayne's secret identity and
inspired by his humanitarian and heroic nature,

365
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,200
Jean Paul rejected the Order and returned home to
Gotham with Batman to break the system's

366
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:47,040
conditioning and to help end the crusade against
Gotham's criminal element. Breaking free from

367
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:54,100
the system proved extremely difficult. It
just...it's impossible. While fighting crime,

368
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:59,380
Azrael would often unknowingly and unwillingly
become over-aggressive and violent. This would

369
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:04,430
cause him a great amount of stress and
frustration, which would turn him into a more

370
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:11,740
aggressive and vicious cycle. He was a
subconscious assassin. Yeah, kinda. Yeah,

371
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:18,060
interesting. I almost think of him like Jason
Bourne, in a way. Like he didn't know he had all

372
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:26,960
these abilities until he was triggered. Yeah.
Batman had strong hope for Jean Paul, who had

373
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,560
proved his usefulness time and time again, thanks
to his physical abilities. When Bane broke

374
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:38,440
Batman's spine, Azrael was chosen to fill in for
him to stop Bane's rise to power. After getting his

375
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,760
ass handed to him by Bane initially, Azrael
developed a new armored bat suit that made him even

376
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:48,740
stronger and faster, with flame-throwing
gauntlets also capable of firing high-velocity

377
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:55,000
razor-sharp batterings. I think most people,
when they... They may not know Jean Paul, but when

378
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,620
they see this suit, they're like, Oh, that's who
Azrael is, that's who Jean Paul Valley is. Yeah,

379
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:04,680
he's like the robotic Batman. Yeah, yeah. The suit
was designed by Joe Cassata, actually. Oh,

380
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:11,520
really? Yeah, interesting. He defeated Bane in
their second match, and this confidence boost

381
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:17,060
only led to him becoming even more violent and
unhinged. He sealed off all entrances to the

382
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:23,520
Batcave, locking Robin out, wanting nothing to do
with him due to Robin's deus approval of Jean

383
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,680
Paul's violent tendencies. After nearly killing
the Joker, Jean Paul lost the trust of many of the

384
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:35,940
Gotham Police Department. Drunk on power,
delusions and hallucinations had developed and

385
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:41,760
intensified, eventually to a point where he let a
serial killer fall to his death, even though he

386
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:48,780
could have saved him because he was having visions
of Saint Dumas. By this time, Bruce had recovered

387
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:55,100
and confronted Jean Paul to strip him of the Batman
mantle. Using nonviolent maneuvers, Bruce

388
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:59,900
stripped Jean Paul of his bat armor in a both
physical and psychological match. That also

389
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:06,560
stripped Jean Paul of his delusions. Mentally
broken, Jean Paul began a rehabilitative quest to

390
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,540
take down the Order of Saint Dumas, which he was
mostly successful in doing as Azrael. Was the

391
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:17,000
order not good though? They were like taking down
like demons and stuff. Like why would why would he

392
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:24,280
take the order down? They're not, I wouldn't say
they're good or bad. They were just, they were a

393
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:30,200
secret society. They go back to the Templars. They
were a splinter group of the Templar Knights

394
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:37,620
during the Crusades. And I think it was Dumas. I
forget his first name. What are those Templar

395
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:42,520
Knights? He found like the treasure of the
Templars and used that to fund a secret society.

396
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:48,180
It's just, it's just one that has been like
carrying out assassinations for centuries. So

397
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:53,560
we're supposed to assume that they're also doing
shady things. Yeah. Okay. I'll believe that. So

398
00:38:53,560 --> 00:39:00,480
Azrael died fighting Garry's surface to La Ha, but
he came back as part of the new 52 relaunch in which

399
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,680
he was an agent of the Order of Saint Dumas once
again. He now wore armor known as the suit of

400
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,780
sorrows, an ancient armor forged from the swords
of fallen Templar Knights that has something like

401
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:16,680
a mystical artificial intelligence. It's not
technical. It's like mystical. It interfaces

402
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:22,320
with the wearer's nervous system, feeding them
extra sensory information like enemy weaknesses

403
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,820
and such. In addition to reinforcing the system's
conditioning, it's been described like having

404
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:33,940
two brains in one body, which is enough to drive any
man insane. This includes Jean-Paul. Batman

405
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:38,320
tried to help him by putting him in a new suit,
designed as a throwback to the Batman armor

406
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:45,240
Jean-Paul wore in the previous continuity.
Developed by Lucius Fox's son, Lucas, the new bat

407
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:50,580
armor had an AI of its own based on Batman's mind
that countered the system's more violent

408
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:56,280
mindset. Having deemed the Azrael line a failure,
the Order of Saint Dumas unleashed a robotic

409
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:01,660
replacement assassin known as Ascalon, an
android with artificial intelligence based on

410
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:07,300
the entire recorded experiences of the suit of
sorrows. As Azrael and Batman tried to stop

411
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:13,040
Ascalon, it was revealed to Jean-Paul that the
leader of the now mostly extinct Order of Saint

412
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,980
Dumas was his father, a revelation that sent him
into a rage that temporarily overthrew his own

413
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:23,960
programming and caused him to punch right through
Ascalon's body, which infected its system with

414
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:30,760
Batman's AI. Due to his genetic modification as a
fetus, Azrael has enhanced strength able to lift

415
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:38,300
several tons, two tons. What? Yes. As well as
increased speed, reflexes, stamina,

416
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:43,680
durability, and the ability to heal several times
faster than ordinary. His mental programming

417
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:48,840
coupled with his innate enhanced senses,
enhanced senses, and the intelligence system of

418
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:54,720
the suit of sorrows, makes him an extremely
skilled and tactical fighter, albeit he is prone

419
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:01,600
to visions and hallucinations. Weapons wise, he
wields a sword that he can ignite on flame, two

420
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:07,120
gauntlet mounted blades, which could also set a
flame, and a dagger that he keeps strapped to his

421
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:13,580
front scabbard. Is the dagger special in any way?
Has like a fleur de lis on it? Pretty fancy. Oh,

422
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,880
that's cool. Okay. I don't think there's anything
sweet about it. No. Okay. It's just a dagger. Yeah.

423
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,860
Okay. So that's Azrael. Well, I didn't know
anything about him. So that's pretty

424
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:27,340
interesting. I've always, I never really liked
the Joe Cassata design. It was weird. It was when he

425
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:33,060
replaced white sleeves and it was just weird. It
was bizarre, but I always liked his modern look. He

426
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:39,260
kind of looks like the Assassin's Creed guy kind of
a little bit. Oh, but yeah, if you're gonna take

427
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,700
like the Assassin's Creed and Moon Knight and mix
them together, you get. I think that's real in a

428
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:48,140
way. All right. We're going to go ahead and
speculate before we, before we actually do the

429
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:53,820
stats and simulations. We're going to speculate
on how we think this matchup would go. When

430
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:58,960
considering this matchup, we always start the
characters 50 yards apart from each other in a

431
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,760
non-environment zone, where they know that each
other are threats, but they don't know anything

432
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,640
else about each other. Right. They're actually
more comparable than I thought they were going to

433
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:12,920
be. Yeah, yeah, I'm trying. I thought I had this one
in the bag and then all of a sudden you're like, oh,

434
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:20,800
two tons. Well, actually, it may even be stronger
than that in some instances, but. So can blade.

435
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:24,500
Those are essentially just feats of strength
again. When I'm breaking down the characters, I

436
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,540
tend to think of them more as like, you know, what's
what's typical. There's no way as real is going out

437
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:32,920
there being able to lift eight tons, which
apparently like he's done something like that

438
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:39,100
before. I just think of that as sloppy writing.
Yeah. You know, oh good. Good. I agree. Slappy

439
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:44,200
writing. What weapons does he have? Let's go over a
weapons list. Well, I went through them. He has his

440
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:49,160
sword that he's able to ignite. He has his blade
gauntlets, which kind of makes him like Wolverine

441
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:54,780
and he has his dagger. But like in previous
incarnations, like he's had he's had multiple

442
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:00,780
suits. He's had like eight different suits, maybe
not that many, but like he wants to have like a

443
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,540
pretty close to a bad man. So he did have things like
batterings and stuff like that. You could assume

444
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:10,860
that he could throw his dagger if you need a
projectile. Sure. If you want one blade, he'll

445
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:18,380
have his throwing stakes. He'll have his two
automatic pistols. His guns. Yeah, he has guns. He

446
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:25,240
has his his main sword and I'll give him his glaive
that he throws. It's like a boomerang knife thing.

447
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:30,220
It's so badass. It was in the movie. Yeah. But he's
also had it in the comics as well. It's really

448
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:37,200
badass. And what else? I think I think that's
that's about it. Metal stakes, glaive, sword,

449
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:47,440
guns. Gauntlet blades, sword, dagger. Is Azrael
suit bulletproof? It's armor. That doesn't

450
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:55,300
answer my question. It's made from swords. Yeah.
Swords of the suit of sorrows is made from. Is that

451
00:43:55,300 --> 00:44:00,900
why he's wearing in this? Yes. Yeah, he's wearing a
suit of sorrows. The one that makes him insane. OK,

452
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:07,860
well, it also makes him more lethal. So does it?
Yeah. OK. More lethal than blade. And it helps him

453
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:13,640
track things, right? So it makes him it helps with
his his agility and it helps with his

454
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:19,540
marksmanship. OK, I think not just marksmanship
with like with weaponry, but also with like his

455
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:25,140
fists and stuff. It's it's not going to find any
weaknesses on blade because blade doesn't really

456
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:30,680
have any weaknesses. So that sort of aspect of is
useless in this match. I think it's going to start

457
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:39,800
off with blade pulling out his guns. I think that's
inevitable. I think in every match, I think as

458
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:47,820
real's primary objective is going to have to be to
disarm blades, guns, somehow or evade the bullets

459
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:52,680
long enough until he runs out of ammo. Question is,
how do you see him doing that? That's because

460
00:44:52,680 --> 00:45:01,280
that's how the match is going to start off. He's
fucking running. He is running his ass off. Like,

461
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:10,800
shit. He's running, but he looked at his sword and
he ignites his sword and he's dragging his sword on

462
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,160
the ground and he's creating like a wall of fire.
And that's going to sort of act like a screen. Oh,

463
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:22,200
that's that's not a bad move. Like, yeah, smoke. Is
it hot enough to set the ground on fire? I've seen

464
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:28,920
like stuff basically explode like when he slices
them just like fire erupting. OK. OK. So he creates

465
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:35,860
a screen using his speed, agility and his flaming
sword. Yeah, it's a pretty good one. All right. So

466
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:41,860
Bway's going to, you know, Wesley Snipes his gun
back into his jacket holster. And then but he, you

467
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:47,040
know, he has good vision. He has good hearing and
stuff. So he could probably peer through the fire

468
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:52,620
and see where Ezreal is. And he's just like a
badass. He's going to leap over the fire like a

469
00:45:52,620 --> 00:46:00,700
strike a cool pose like in midair. And as he lands,
he's going to hurl his glaive right at right at

470
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:08,200
Ezreal. OK, so Ezreal catches the glaive out of
what? What? What? You can't catch blades. Maybe.

471
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:15,120
Yeah, he absolutely. So OK, so he's not. Can blade
catches on glaive? Yes. OK, then Ezreal can. So

472
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:20,340
what you're saying is Ezreal no longer has a hand.
No, he goes to catch it and then it goes right

473
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:27,500
through his hand and he's like, damn it. I remember
how does blade catch it? He's just a badass. Well,

474
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:32,380
he has enhanced senses so you could time it well as
it's coming back to him with his eyesight. Not only

475
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:37,820
does Ezreal have enhanced senses, he also has the
suit of sorrows. What the fuck ever, man? OK, so he

476
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:44,340
catches it fine. He catches it and he's texted away
for later. OK, he pulls out his sword. OK, right.

477
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:48,680
And then blade pulls out his sword. And raise blade
lands and then blades like ready to die.

478
00:46:48,680 --> 00:47:01,060
Motherfucker. OK, John Paul, I have no comeback.
John Paul, just he's just silent and cool. So he. So

479
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:08,440
they go at each other with the swords. Yeah. And the
sword fight. But as real as you know, sword is

480
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:15,120
better because it's flaming. OK, so yeah, they're
the sort of thing. I'm pretty sure Azrael is a

481
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:21,440
better sword fighter. No, I'm pretty sure he's not
because blade is like the best sword fighter, one

482
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:26,180
of the best sword fighters in the Marvel Universe.
Azrael is one of the best sword fighters in DC. OK,

483
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:32,860
so that means they're even. OK, who the fucking
sword fighting? It probably looks bad ass. Yeah,

484
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:39,700
yeah, yeah, like doing flips and like cool shit
spinning around. Yeah, like the capoeira kind of

485
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:46,240
stuff. The cool thing, though, is that, you know,
well, Azrael has his sword in one hand and he's, you

486
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:53,860
know, sword fighting there. He ejects and ignites
the risk mounted blade on his other arm and just

487
00:47:53,860 --> 00:48:01,160
goes at blade with two blades. He's fighting blade
with blades. So blade is fighting off two two

488
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,720
blades all of a sudden. And he and he's surprised.
He is surprised. He didn't see those those

489
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:13,420
gauntlets blades come out. So he he reaches into
his little hip holster and he flings like three

490
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:18,920
silver stakes right at Azrael. Now they bounce
right off his armor. No, right at his face. They

491
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:23,360
bounce right off his armored face. He doesn't have
an army. Yeah, he does have an armor. It's like it's

492
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:32,020
like a cloth. No, it's not. Look closer. It's it's
metallic. OK, so there's no. Are you saying that

493
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:38,140
there's no where that blade can strike Azrael with
his stakes? Well, there is. I don't know if you

494
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:46,780
could see them, though. Oh, he sees. He's Azrael.
He doesn't wear a helmet. He wears a mask with the

495
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:56,220
hood. Oh, so the back of his head. So blades sees the
hood. So he does a flip over and as he's up, you know,

496
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:04,700
upside down mid flip, he jumps a stake into
Azrael's head. Right. Except that no, because as

497
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:10,380
he's doing that, Azrael is also moving at the same
time as well as constantly moving. He's super

498
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:17,600
agile. OK. That's when he takes his dagger and
throws it at blade. And that's when blade. Oh, his

499
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:23,860
dagger. Yeah. Oh, blade would knock that out of the
air with his sword. But it's super fast. I don't

500
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:31,300
know if you know this. He's like super fast in short
distances. And so now that he knocked the blade out

501
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:37,620
of the way, that's when he pulls his gun back out and
then goes. So that's when Azrael pulls out the

502
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:44,300
blade that he had been saving. And knocks the gun
out of blades hand with it. OK. Oh, yeah. Good call

503
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:51,240
there. I'm all out of projectiles. What else do I
got? I use the guns. I use the glaive. I use the

504
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:57,560
stakes. I have the sword. So he knocks the the
glaive or the gun out of blades hand with the glaive

505
00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:04,360
that he stole from him. Yes. OK. You have to
remember like there's fire everywhere. Fire

506
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:09,780
everywhere. Blade doesn't give a shit about fire.
Yeah, he does. Well, kind of mean like he can still

507
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:16,260
burn. Yeah, he's in pain. He's in pain. Yeah, but he
you know, he heals pretty quick. So it's just it's

508
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:22,540
just it's just a flesh wound. Just a minor burn.
Well, his body is is too busy healing itself to be

509
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:27,380
paying as closely attention to Azrael and his
attacks as it should be. I'm trying to figure out

510
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:33,460
how blade can get through armor. Azrael's armor.
Like it's not that durable. Right. I mean, like

511
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:38,460
eventually, yeah, I mean, yeah, it's really
durable. He's gonna have to he's gonna have to

512
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:42,940
target the back of his head then or something. I
mean, it's not because it's unfortunate that he

513
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:48,860
has bladed weapon. Like I don't the bladed weapons
won't necessarily get through a metallic armor.

514
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:54,100
Like if it was like slashing weapons, right? Yeah,
like slash and stab weapons. That's what armor is

515
00:50:54,100 --> 00:51:00,260
made for, you know. Right. So that's a little
rough. Yeah. You want to take this to the stats?

516
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:04,620
Because you give up. Do you have? Because you give
up. I don't give up. No, I just already know that

517
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:11,100
blade already killed Azrael with the stake to the
back of the head. He was like, some other fuck as a

518
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:17,620
wish on an ice skate uphill and then stabs him in the
back of the head. What does that even mean? It just

519
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:21,800
sounds cool saying it so you could say it. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. Yeah, let's go to the stats. All right,

520
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:32,160
we'll go to the stats. We'll be right back.
Gregorian chants always remind me of Monty

521
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:42,480
Python. It's true when they hit themselves on the
head with the board. Yes, you're Dominic. Don't

522
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:48,700
he's right. I think that's just off the top of my
head. That was pretty good. We've ever seen that

523
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:53,720
movie in decades. Yes, seriously. Decade.
Decades. One decade at that one. Yeah, we're not

524
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:59,980
that old. All right, so we ran a thousand
simulations, putting their stats together. The

525
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:06,400
stats were interesting because a lot of them came
out closer than what I thought they would be. It was

526
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,180
mainly being like, oh, yeah, blades way better at
this. And then Jonathan going, no, no, no, he's

527
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:16,960
just as good. And then me going, no, shut up, you're
stupid. And then him going, no, look. Yeah, we

528
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:23,220
determined that blade is faster in short bursts
because he could essentially almost almost

529
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:28,780
teleport. Yeah, almost. Yeah, as well as is
stronger. Yeah, he's stronger. That surprised

530
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:36,480
me. Barely though. His insanity was a bigger
detriment than I thought it was going to be. Right,

531
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:42,020
which makes me kind of sad because he's he's
definitely not as intelligent as Batman, but he

532
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:46,520
is, you know, he does have that conditioning that
essentially just makes him a perfect weapon.

533
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:53,460
Unfortunately, you know, he is again, once again,
prone to to hallucinations and stuff like that. So

534
00:52:53,460 --> 00:53:02,260
it's unfortunate and it hindered him in these
stats, I think. How confident are you feeling

535
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:06,860
right now? Not as confident as it was earlier
because I was like, fucking, as we could do

536
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:12,960
anything blade can do and he wears armor. But there
was one thing that he couldn't do, which is shoot

537
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:20,500
guns. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that ended up being a
factor in this as well. I'm not going to pretend

538
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:24,500
like, you know, Azrael doesn't get tagged
occasionally because, you know, I've seen him

539
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:32,180
bleed for sure. But I'm curious to see what the
results are for sure. All right. Okay, so the

540
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:42,790
winner of the Azrael Blade Dynamic Duel is...
Azrael. What? No, I'm just kidding. No. Aw, you

541
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:50,560
asshole. I do that to you all the time the other way
around. I hate you. It's Blade, whatever. Blade

542
00:53:50,560 --> 00:54:01,320
won... Not by much. Blade won 596% or 596 battles
out of 1000, which is 59.6%. And yeah, the guns

543
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:06,380
played a huge factor in this. It's fucked up. I
mean, I don't think they would have played that big

544
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:12,400
of a role in this match. I mean, Azrael has taken on
guys like Deathstroke and Batman and Bane and

545
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:17,460
beating them. You say that there's nothing that
Blade can do to Azrael, but what can Azrael do to

546
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:24,190
Blade, considering his healing factor, his
speed, and all that stuff? It's a close match. I

547
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:31,420
mean, 59.6 is not that high. It's not as high as the
last match. I mean, this is not too bad for you,

548
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:38,940
right? I mean... Dude, I'm still sad. I'm
heartbroken. It broke my heart. It's what I do.

549
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:44,600
It's what Marvel does. They stomp on DC
characters. It's what they're good at. They stomp

550
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:49,980
on DC characters and they know things. They have
the t-shirt that says that. That's what they do.

551
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,380
Anyway, I've never seen this shirt. I have no idea
what you're talking about. Do you know what that's

552
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:59,520
a reference to? No. Okay, never mind then. All
right. That does it for this episode. Don't forget

553
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,640
to answer our question of the week, which was

I don't really know anything. Next episode, we

560
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:49,600
will be kicking off Black History Month by doing a
review of the first Blade movie. Super excited for

561
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:57,320
that, especially since Blade is a winner in my
book. It's been a long time since I saw the movie.

562
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:01,880
It's good. Forget the director's name. Steven
Norrington. Steven Norrington. He's just a

563
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:07,580
fantastic director. Yeah, he is. He is really
good. So stylized. Don't count the League of

564
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:12,440
Extraordinary Gentlemen against him. Yeah,
totally. Totally. But yeah, so looking forward to

565
00:56:12,440 --> 
that. And we will talk to you guys in a week. Yep. Up,
up and away. True believers.
