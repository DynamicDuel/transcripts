00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,957
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,418 --> 00:00:29,602
Welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,642 --> 00:00:35,527
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:36,007 --> 00:00:42,833
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother Marvelous
Joe. And in this episode- Incoming. Whoa, what's

5
00:00:42,873 --> 00:00:49,439
going on AJ9K? Incoming transmission from Diamondback
at Console Combat. File name man vmonster.afd.

6
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:58,310
Duel input re-initiated. new fighter selection,
Godzilla vs Ultraman. Okay that's weird, so

7
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:04,255
it seems like our initial episode idea has been
scrapped due to this glitch and we are now

8
00:01:04,295 --> 00:01:10,701
going to bring you the matchup of Godzilla vs
Ultraman. Crazy! And since this glitch is coming

9
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:16,466
from Console Combat, we bet that you can probably
check out the first part of this duel matchup

10
00:01:16,646 --> 00:01:21,042
over on their podcast. We're just going to be
continuing the battle here. Before that, we're

11
00:01:21,062 --> 00:01:24,865
going to break down the comic book movie news
from the past week, of which there was none!

12
00:01:25,005 --> 00:01:31,149
But we did miss a news item from two weeks ago,
and that was the third trailer for Suicide

13
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:36,613
Squad, Isekai. That's right, folks, this entire
episode is brought to you from the Isle of

14
00:01:36,653 --> 00:01:42,036

37
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:42,731
to the No Prize! A No Prize is an award Marvel
used to give out to fans. Our version, the

38
00:03:42,771 --> 00:03:47,235
Dynamic Duel No Prize, is a digital award we
post on Instagram for the person that we feel

39
00:03:47,255 --> 00:03:52,828
gave the best answer to our question of the
week. Last week we asked, what song do you

40
00:03:52,868 --> 00:03:57,912
hope to hear in Joker Follyadoo and what character
would sing it? Now this is coming off of the

41
00:03:57,952 --> 00:04:04,117
news that the Joker sequel movie is going to
be a jukebox musical with popular pop songs

42
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:08,961
in it. It was a disappointing news item but
it gave us some great answers that we're going

43
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:12,924
to break down now. We got a lot of them. We're
going to give you the three honorable mentions

44
00:04:13,104 --> 00:04:19,129
as well as the no prize winner. Our first honorable
mention goes to Christian Rubito who said.

45
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:24,285
Hey, this is Christian Urbito. I'm going to
submit the answer of Break Stuff by Lynn Biscuit,

46
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:28,789
because that's kind of how I feel when I learned
that this movie was going to be a musical.

47
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:33,553
The first movie is one of my favorite DC movies
ever. And to hear this is extremely disappointing.

48
00:04:34,033 --> 00:04:38,797
And to the fact of who can sing it, I guess
everyone together. So it can really pack a

49
00:04:38,837 --> 00:04:46,463
punch. Yeah, thanks, all. I mean, it's all about
the he said, she said bullshit. I hope you

50
00:04:46,483 --> 00:04:50,706
know that Joker packs his chainsaw, and they'll
skin your ass raw. Weren't those the days when

51
00:04:50,726 --> 00:04:58,008
like Limp Bizkit was like, OK to like? Yeah.
Oh, man, they were huge back in the day. And

52
00:04:58,108 --> 00:05:02,489
I don't know what happened. They just sucked,
I guess. I don't know about that. I still like

53
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:07,390
I really still like the song that they did for
Mission Impossible. But break stuff. That's

54
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:13,532
an inspired choice. I can't say that I see that
working too well within the tone that Todd

55
00:05:13,572 --> 00:05:18,273
Phillips has established with the first Joker
movie. But then again, this seems to be a departure

56
00:05:18,293 --> 00:05:23,627
from that anyway. Right, I mean, and plus, you
know, the Joker's an angry guy and Break Stuff

57
00:05:23,807 --> 00:05:28,308
is like the ultimate angry song. So, great answer,
Christian. Our next honorable mention goes

58
00:05:28,348 --> 00:05:34,690
to Andrew Shunk, who said, Hey guys, Andrew
Shunk here. I would have to say Mad World,

59
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:43,612
the Gary Jules version that was in Donnie Darko,
would be great for this movie. I would have

60
00:05:43,692 --> 00:05:50,587
Harley Quinn sing it and it could even be a
duet. but start with Harley Quinn singing.

61
00:05:50,607 --> 00:05:55,729
Feeling kind of funny, feeling kind of sad.
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best

62
00:05:55,869 --> 00:06:01,491
I've ever had. I think those depressing lyrics
totally fit fine with the themes of the Joker.

63
00:06:01,892 --> 00:06:05,473
Yeah, he mentioned that he would want to hear
the Gary Jules version, which is a great version.

64
00:06:05,753 --> 00:06:10,615
But of course, that is a cover of a song originally
done by Tears for Fears. And I think that one

65
00:06:10,635 --> 00:06:16,158
would actually work pretty well within the period
piece type of film that is the Joker. And also,

66
00:06:16,318 --> 00:06:20,759
I believe Harley Quinn first debuted in an episode
of Batman the Animated Series that was called

67
00:06:20,899 --> 00:06:25,580
Mad Love. Well, it wasn't her debut, but it
was an award-winning episode that went into

68
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:32,062
her origin. I see, I see. Mad World, Mad Love.
They could change it up to Mad Love. Yeah,

69
00:06:32,102 --> 00:06:39,124
totally. Great answer, Andrew. Our final honorable
mention goes to Waldo. Found him! Who said?

70
00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:45,274
Hey guys, this is Waldo. Longtime listener,
first time caller. I feel like It's an obvious

71
00:06:45,394 --> 00:06:53,378
answer, but I just have to say it. Lady Gaga
needs to sing Joker Face. I mean, it's right

72
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:59,702
there. If they don't do it, that is an intentionally
missed opportunity. Mama, Mama Joker Face,

73
00:06:59,742 --> 00:07:04,645
Mama Joker Face, Mama, Mama. Yeah, you know
she doesn't repeat Poker Face that second time,

74
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:09,468
right? Did you know that? I only just learned
that she says Fucker Face in this song. That's

75
00:07:09,488 --> 00:07:16,207
crazy. Kids, listen to that on the radio. No,
but taking poker face and trying to get into

76
00:07:16,267 --> 00:07:23,272
Joker face is very on the nose for a film starring
Lady Gaga. Probably too on the nose for the

77
00:07:23,312 --> 00:07:30,077
film, but I did like your creative twist on
the song to make it Joker face. I wonder what

78
00:07:30,097 --> 00:07:36,742
she'll mean when she goes, can't read my can't
read my no, he can't read my Joker face. It

79
00:07:36,762 --> 00:07:42,338
means she's just wearing too much makeup, I
guess. Great answers. Everyone, we want to

80
00:07:42,358 --> 00:07:46,840
give a quick shout out to Colby Hentges, John
Storosky, Mitchell Smoothie and Scott Camacho

81
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,543
for also taking the time to visit our website
and drop us an answer. Appreciate it guys.

82
00:07:51,623 --> 00:07:56,986
But the winner of this week's No Prize goes
to Lizzie Dyer Arnie, who said, Cause I'm a

83
00:07:57,026 --> 00:08:05,871
picker, I'm a grinner, I'm a lover, and I'm
a sinner. Playing my music in the sun. I'm

84
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:14,192
a joker, I'm a smoker, I'm a midnight toker.
Shoulda want to hurt no one.

85
00:08:17,335 --> 00:08:23,120
The Joker by the Steve Miller band. Thanks.
Yeah. Great job. There we go. Great job. Well

86
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:28,625
done. Great answer, by the way. Actually, when
we first asked this question, I told Jonathan

87
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:32,889
that I was hoping someone would answer with
The Joker by the Steve Miller band because

88
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:37,333
that's like, you know, that's the obvious answer.
It's set right in that time period too. And

89
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:41,999
it just seems spot on. Great job Lizzie for
giving us that great rendition. That was awesome.

90
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:47,162
As is the song. I totally remember jamming out
to that song on Guitar Hero back when that

91
00:08:47,182 --> 00:08:51,145
was a thing. Yeah I hated doing vocals for that
song. You know what part like whistles it's

92
00:08:51,165 --> 00:08:56,988
like whoo whoo. Great answer Lizzie. Thanks
for being a great sport. You win this week's

93
00:08:57,028 --> 00:09:01,070
no prize. If you the listener want a shot at
winning your own no prize, stay tuned to later

94
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,552
on this episode when we'll be asking another
question of the week. And now that that's done,

95
00:09:06,173 --> 00:09:06,973
on to the news.

96
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:18,567
Okay, so a couple of weeks ago we got the third
trailer for the anime series, Suicide Squad

97
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:25,429
Isakai, along with a release date for the premiere
of the show in Japan at least. We have no word

98
00:09:25,449 --> 00:09:30,150
when it's gonna arrive in America yet, but at
least we know in Japan it will be debuting

99
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:35,932
this July. I imagine it's not gonna come to
America until they localize it and do dubs

100
00:09:36,132 --> 00:09:41,213
for the voice track, but who knows, we'll see.
I wouldn't watch that anyway, I'm gonna watch

101
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:48,220
the subs. Hell yeah, subs before dubs. The trailer
starts off with this romantic kind of scene

102
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,482
between Harley Quinn and the Joker, who looks
pretty awesome. Way cooler than the Jared Leto

103
00:09:53,522 --> 00:09:58,964
version. He still has tattoos, but the tattoo
is like of a smile on his face rather than

104
00:09:59,004 --> 00:10:04,887
like damaged. Yeah, these tattoos actually make
sense. Right, yeah. A lot of this film looks

105
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:11,129
heavily inspired by both Suicide Squad films
and it's just pretty much dripping with style.

106
00:10:11,426 --> 00:10:15,347
but it also doesn't hurt that it has a pretty
catchy J-pop song going on in the background.

107
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:19,908
The trailer definitely seems to be promoting
the song, which I guess is called Go-Getters

108
00:10:19,988 --> 00:10:25,570
by Maury Kaliope. Never heard of that artist,
but it's pretty cool. I thought you were a

109
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:31,612
big J-pop fan, Jon. K-pop, bro! K-pop! Don't
be racist! I bet you so many new listeners

110
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:35,853
are surprised that you listen to K-pop, and
so many older listeners are not surprised at

111
00:10:35,893 --> 00:10:41,227
all considering how little you know about music.
That's why it's because he listens to K-pop.

112
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:47,110
Just because you spend a year living in Korea.
It's catchy. It's catchy. But no, it looks

113
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:51,693
like eventually Harley Quinn gets separated
from the Joker and she's taken with other members

114
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:57,356
of the Suicide Squad to the world of Isekai,
which I guess is connected to the DC world

115
00:10:57,417 --> 00:11:03,660
through a portal of some sort. And they're there
to put a stop between a war between a kingdom

116
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:09,055
and an empire, it looks like. Is it just me
or is the plot to this thing look extremely

117
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:13,477
vague? Like we've gotten three trailers for
this and I don't think we've gotten any new

118
00:11:13,517 --> 00:11:17,339
information on what the story actually is, besides
the fact that they go into this other realm.

119
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:22,141
I don't know. It feels very much like a Japanese
anime teaser to me. You know, at the end of

120
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:26,322
most anime episodes, they'll tease the next
episode and I have no idea what the hell they're

121
00:11:26,342 --> 00:11:31,425
teasing, to be honest. I'm like, well, that's
pretty crazy. Is that really the continuation

122
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:36,431
of the story? All right, sure. This definitely
feels like that. But it's cool just to see

123
00:11:36,472 --> 00:11:40,234
the cast of characters that they have. As we've
seen in previous trailers, they're bringing

124
00:11:40,274 --> 00:11:46,779
Harley Quinn, Deadshot, King Shark, Peacemaker,
Rick Flag. But this is the first time we get

125
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:51,902
to see Diablo, from the first Suicide Squad
movie, the one that controls fire. Although

126
00:11:52,022 --> 00:11:56,585
this time they're giving him a like Michael
Jackson kind of vibe. Yeah, that's weird. I

127
00:11:56,625 --> 00:12:00,288
think it's kind of cool. Another thing that
caught me off guard here is that it's almost

128
00:12:00,368 --> 00:12:04,818
like they're breaking the fourth wall. because
you have the Joker talking about like, oh,

129
00:12:04,838 --> 00:12:09,179
this is just a really long intro to the show.
And then Diablo later on is like, oh, they

130
00:12:09,219 --> 00:12:13,661
miscast us. It's kind of interesting. I wonder
if they'll actually play into that. Do you

131
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:18,622
think it's strange mixing the world of Suicide
Squad with like this medieval fantasy setting?

132
00:12:19,102 --> 00:12:24,163
Yeah, and that's partially why I'm here for
it. Like it's gonna be really, really interesting

133
00:12:24,364 --> 00:12:28,285
and something you probably haven't seen before,
especially with these characters. By the end

134
00:12:28,325 --> 00:12:32,630
of the trailer, we see that Harley Quinn really
just wants to return home. to her lover, the

135
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:37,751
Joker, and she's definitely like the standout
character of this trailer, of all the trailers

136
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:41,112
really. It looks like she's the main character
of the show. It looks like there's a lot of

137
00:12:41,132 --> 00:12:45,854
romantic elements at play, not just between
the Joker and Harley Quinn, but I don't know,

138
00:12:45,874 --> 00:12:51,535
just the setting of the world that they venture
into seems highly romanticized. Yeah, that's

139
00:12:51,575 --> 00:12:58,457
fair. And also very Shinto in a way, or at least
like Eastern folklore with like giant boars

140
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:03,732
and stuff like that. I really hope that this
gets released in the US this year. I'm not

141
00:13:03,752 --> 00:13:08,034
holding my breath. Even if they don't localize
it, I would still love to find a way to watch

142
00:13:08,074 --> 00:13:13,496
the Japanese subtitled version. But given the
fact that this series is an anime, that brings

143
00:13:13,557 --> 00:13:14,877
us to our question of the week.

144
00:13:19,554 --> 00:13:26,256
What is your favorite anime? And why? And it
doesn't have to be just Marvel or DC. I'm just

145
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:30,938
curious. Yeah, record your answer at dynamicduel.com
by clicking on the red microphone button in

146
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:34,740
the bottom right-hand corner of the screen,
which will prompt you to leave us a voicemail.

147
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,102
Your message could be up to 30 seconds long,
and don't forget to leave your name in case

148
00:13:39,142 --> 00:13:43,323
we include you on the podcast. We'll pick our
favorite answer and award that person a Dynamic

149
00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:48,525
Duel No Prize that we'll post to Instagram.
Be sure to answer before April 6th.

150
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:59,943
That does it for all the news for this episode.
Now let's go ahead and move on to the main

151
00:13:59,983 --> 00:14:05,671
event, where we find out who is going to win
in a fight between the DC Comics version of

152
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:09,797
Godzilla and the Marvel Comics version of Ultraman.

153
00:14:25,162 --> 00:14:31,588
Okay, so I'm not sure why our network's AI simulators
have decided to glitch this April Fool's week

154
00:14:32,028 --> 00:14:38,414
and give us all Godzilla vs. Ultraman duels,
but I'm here for it because the rights to Godzilla

155
00:14:38,574 --> 00:14:43,619
are partially owned by Legendary Pictures, who
teams up with Warner Brothers to make some

156
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:49,204
pretty awesome Godzilla movies. And they've
even done some comics published by DC, also

157
00:14:49,324 --> 00:14:54,720
owned by Warner Brothers. Yeah, and actually
Marvel Comics has produced three Ultraman miniseries,

158
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:59,442
which have come out recently, I think starting
in 2020. So Ultraman is a Marvel Comics character

159
00:14:59,462 --> 00:15:04,525
of sorts. What a coincidence! Who would have
thought? Crazy! It's almost like we all got

160
00:15:04,545 --> 00:15:08,427
together and brainstormed which characters could
work across all of our different podcasts in

161
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:13,450
our network. Yeah, because there are video game
versions of Godzilla and Ultraman. There are

162
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:19,193
comic versions that we're going over. There
are movie versions, obviously, and anime versions.

163
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:22,979
So this is pretty exciting. Yeah, can't wait
to find out who's gonna win between Godzilla

164
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:27,143
and Ultraman, but to explain the methodology
behind our duels, let's go to our sentient

165
00:15:27,183 --> 00:15:32,647
duel simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ and INK
tell our listeners how you go about determining

166
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:37,832
a winner in our duel matchups. Yes, of course,
sir. The way I determine a winner between the

167
00:15:37,872 --> 00:15:43,897
contestants is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations
using the characters' statistics. A Monte Carlo

168
00:15:43,937 --> 00:15:48,221
simulation is a probabilistic model used to
determine outcomes through random sampling.

169
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:53,531
In this case... I randomize the statistics along
a normal distribution as a way to simulate

170
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:58,152
the many variables that can occur during battle.
The stat parameters are based on the official

171
00:15:58,212 --> 00:16:03,514
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters'
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat

172
00:16:03,554 --> 00:16:09,075
categories are included such as range, damage
potential, versatility and perception in order

173
00:16:09,115 --> 00:16:14,537
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.
The results of the 1000 simulations provide

174
00:16:14,557 --> 00:16:19,031
a percentage of wins for each character. Contestant
with the higher percentage is declared the

175
00:16:19,091 --> 00:16:24,235
victor as they have a higher probability to
win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,

176
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:29,418
neither character should win 100% of the matches.
The comic book stories have shown that there's

177
00:16:29,558 --> 00:16:34,381
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so
the confidence rate of my method falls in line

178
00:16:34,401 --> 00:16:38,985
with the precedents that have been established
in the source material. My mathematical simulations

179
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:44,188
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes

180
00:16:44,228 --> 00:16:50,484
tabulated for determination of the winner. Thanks
AJ9K! Before we run the simulations though,

181
00:16:50,504 --> 00:16:55,508
we like to break down each character's comic
book histories and abilities before improvising

182
00:16:55,608 --> 00:17:00,813
a scenario on how we imagine one of the 1000
simulations would play out, beat for beat.

183
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:05,817
And I believe it's my turn to go first with
the DC character's backstory, the DC version

184
00:17:05,837 --> 00:17:13,863
of Godzilla, which is the Monsterverse version.
Now in 1980 Tokyo, a young Ishiro Serizawa,

185
00:17:14,164 --> 00:17:20,867
played by Ken Watanabe on screen, met with his
father Eiji, who confided in Ashiro about his

186
00:17:20,947 --> 00:17:28,409
secret job, beginning his tale in Hiroshima
in 1945 after the atomic bombing. Amidst the

187
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:34,451
devastation, Eiji, then a sailor in the Japanese
Navy, searched for his wife and newborn son

188
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:41,173
Ashiro, but was only able to find Ashiro. Eiji
immediately afterward witnessed a mysterious

189
00:17:41,213 --> 00:17:46,507
and massive creature flying in the area. and
suspected it had something to do with the bombing.

190
00:17:46,808 --> 00:17:52,572
While Ashiro was cared for by his grandparents,
Eiji continued serving in the Japanese Navy.

191
00:17:53,152 --> 00:17:59,256
One year after the bombing, Eiji's naval unit
was dispatched to aid an American vessel stranded

192
00:17:59,336 --> 00:18:05,400
on a small Pacific island. Encountering the
same terrifying creature that Eiji saw a year

193
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:12,045
prior, Eiji's unit and the American crew were
all killed, save for Eiji and one American

194
00:18:12,105 --> 00:18:19,868
survivor. Lee Shaw. Impressed by Eiji's rescue,
Shaw recruited him for the US government, leading

195
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:26,131
Eiji to join Monarch, a secret military unit
tasked with combating massive unidentified

196
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:32,974
terrestrial organisms, or MUTOs for short. The
MUTO creature, later dubbed a Shinobura by

197
00:18:33,134 --> 00:18:39,617
Eiji, continued annual attacks around the Pacific,
each time drawing attention to another mythical

198
00:18:39,657 --> 00:18:47,957
creature dubbed Gojira. which only AEG ever
glimpsed and believed existed. In 1953, Monarch

199
00:18:47,977 --> 00:18:54,841
discovered a giant Shinomura cell, proving the
Mudo was actually an organized swarm of smaller

200
00:18:54,881 --> 00:19:01,264
creatures and allowed AEG to theorize about
its connection to Gojira, believing both they

201
00:19:01,444 --> 00:19:07,468
and other Mudos hailed from a prehistoric time
when the Earth was much more radioactive. The

202
00:19:07,508 --> 00:19:14,340
Shinomura destroyed Monarch's headquarters soon
after. and Eiji, believing Gojira had protected

203
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:21,104
them from the Shinomura prior, was tasked with
fighting this Godzilla. The following year,

204
00:19:21,465 --> 00:19:27,088
on Matata Island, Eiji witnessed that there
were actually two Shinomuras, prior to them

205
00:19:27,148 --> 00:19:32,452
merging in order to fight Godzilla, who had
caught up to them. Using his atomic breath,

206
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:37,135
Godzilla managed to re-divide the two monsters
and kill one of them.

207
00:19:40,738 --> 00:19:46,699
who witnessed the tail end of the Mudo fight.
Seeking to spare Godzilla from Monarch's plan

208
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:52,681
to destroy him and the Shinomura with a nuclear
bomb, Eiji confronted Monarch's head general

209
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:58,442
and pleaded for a peaceful resolution, though
he ultimately witnessed the bombing of both

210
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:05,064
on Bikini Island, disguised as nuclear testing.
The result was the confirmation of the Shinomura's

211
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:13,212
death and the presumption of Godzilla's. he
assured his son Ishiro that Godzilla was still

212
00:20:13,252 --> 00:20:19,998
alive. Eiji died one year later, and during
his funeral, Ishiro was approached by Shaw

213
00:20:20,258 --> 00:20:26,043
to join Monarch. That story was told in the
comic Godzilla Awakening, a prequel to the

214
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:32,789
2014 film Godzilla, which, along with Kong Skull
Island, kicked off Warner Brothers and Legendary

215
00:20:32,829 --> 00:20:38,353
Pictures Monsterverse film series, which includes
the events from Godzilla, King of Monsters,

216
00:20:38,786 --> 00:20:46,072
Godzilla vs. Kong, the TV series Monarch Legacy
of Monsters, and the newly released film Godzilla

217
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:53,297
Kong, The New Empire. Also in the canon are
prequel comic series published not by DC, but

218
00:20:53,358 --> 00:21:01,104
by Legendary Comics, namely Godzilla Aftershock,
Godzilla Dominion, and Godzilla Kong The Hunted.

219
00:21:01,264 --> 00:21:08,322
But recently, both Godzilla and Kong have also
appeared in the pages of DC Comics in versus

220
00:21:08,362 --> 00:21:15,187
Godzilla versus Kong seven part miniseries of
which only the first six issues have been released

221
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:21,711
as of this recording. Spoiler warning if you
haven't read it yet. In this alternate timeline

222
00:21:21,751 --> 00:21:28,336
tale the Legion of Doom unleashed Titano, a
skyscraper sized gorilla in Metropolis as a

223
00:21:28,376 --> 00:21:33,620
distraction for them to invade the Forges of
Solitude and steal the Mother Box stored there.

224
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,891
When they accidentally set off an alarm the
Justice League arrived and battled the Legion,

225
00:21:39,292 --> 00:21:44,836
during which time Toy Man stole the Dreamstone
and the Mother Box was triggered, sending the

226
00:21:44,876 --> 00:21:51,121
Legion to Skull Island in the Monsterverse.
After Toy Man was berated by Lex Luthor over

227
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:57,345
his fascination with the Titan-designated Mudos
that he observed while in a Monarch base, Toy

228
00:21:57,385 --> 00:22:02,089
Man made a wish using the Dreamstone that all
of the monsters could come back with them to

229
00:22:02,129 --> 00:22:08,084
their universe. While proposing marriage to
Lois Lane atop the Daily Planet, Clark Kent

230
00:22:08,204 --> 00:22:14,247
witnessed the emergence of Godzilla in Metropolis,
and the two battled while other titans, a giant

231
00:22:14,287 --> 00:22:22,390
Cthulhu-like spider Cilla in Central City, the
gigantic bat Kamizots in Gotham, and the colossal

232
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:26,032
mammoth Behemoth on Themyscira also appear.

233
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:35,594
His allies Hawk Girl Shazam, Supergirl, and
Atom Smasher managed to bring the monster down

234
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:41,598
together, causing Godzilla to flee into the
ocean. Meanwhile, as heroes bring down the

235
00:22:41,658 --> 00:22:47,322
Titans and the other cities, Wonder Woman brought
Green Arrow to Skull Island, which mysteriously

236
00:22:47,362 --> 00:22:53,367
appeared in the ocean as he'd volunteered to
investigate. There, he found King Kong battling

237
00:22:53,447 --> 00:22:58,819
hordes of other monsters to prevent them from
escaping the island. After being subdued by

238
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:04,104
Supergirl, Conk helped Green Arrow fend off
the League of Assassins, who also arrived on

239
00:23:04,124 --> 00:23:10,049
the island to investigate and managed to escape
with one of the fallen Skullcrawler monsters.

240
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:16,435
Superman, seemingly dead, was placed in a stasis
pod on the Justice League satellite headquarters,

241
00:23:16,856 --> 00:23:21,340
while the League reviewed footage of the Legion's
attack on the Fortress of Solitude to determine

242
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:27,226
what caused the Titans to emerge. As Lex Luthor
plotted a way to control the Titans to his

243
00:23:27,387 --> 00:23:32,768
end, the League traveled into the ocean to help
Aquaman defend Atlantis from the giant sea

244
00:23:32,808 --> 00:23:38,950
monster Tiamat, only for Godzilla to come to
their aid, just as Aquaman also unleashed the

245
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:44,892
Kraken. Though Godzilla and the League defeated
the Titan, the Kraken was able to help Aquaman

246
00:23:44,952 --> 00:23:51,013
chain Godzilla in the Kraken's own shackles
within a massive abyss. With help from Lois

247
00:23:51,073 --> 00:23:55,815
Lane, The League learned about Monarch and was
able to access their files concerning each

248
00:23:55,835 --> 00:24:01,056
of the Titans as they grouped and assessed all
of the threats, including Les Luthor finding

249
00:24:01,076 --> 00:24:06,738
and taking control of Mecha-Godzilla, Ras Al
Ghul bringing a Skullcrawler back to life in

250
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:13,360
a Lazarus pit, and Gorilla Grodd manipulating
King Kong by taking mental control over Supergirl.

251
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:19,181
Behemoth, Scylla, and Tiamat joined Mecha-Godzilla
and the Legion in Metropolis to battle the

252
00:24:19,221 --> 00:24:25,815
Justice League. alongside a giant Batman robot
that Batman had built, a mini Batplane sidekick

253
00:24:25,875 --> 00:24:31,117
bot controlled by Nightwing and Damien, and
the human Green Lantern Corps members who formed

254
00:24:31,217 --> 00:24:37,038
a giant green robot of their own named Robo.
When Gorilla Grodd and his Gorilla City army

255
00:24:37,098 --> 00:24:43,160
joined the fray with Supergirl and King Kong
under his control, he and Kong successfully

256
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:50,150
destroyed Robo and he even managed to kill the
Green Lantern Guy Gardener. Despite Beast Boy

257
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:55,832
trying to even the odds by transforming into
a King Kong sized gorilla, he was easily taken

258
00:24:55,912 --> 00:25:01,054
out by Supergirl, who was brought under control
once the Justice League defeated Grodd, bringing

259
00:25:01,094 --> 00:25:07,137
Kong to the side of the good guys, only then
for Russell Gould's Skullcrawler army to arrive.

260
00:25:07,617 --> 00:25:13,480
As hope seemed to vanish, Superman finally awoke
from his stasis chamber and dove into the depths

261
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:18,141
of the ocean to free Godzilla. And we'll see
how this story concludes in issue number 7.

262
00:25:18,638 --> 00:25:26,082
due out on April 16th. Powers-wise, the Monsterverse
version of Godzilla is 120 meters of brute

263
00:25:26,102 --> 00:25:32,085
strength, able to destroy skyscrapers and battleships
with a wave of his tail, which is serrated

264
00:25:32,205 --> 00:25:37,508
all the way up his spine. He has sharp claws
and teeth, and he's durable enough to survive

265
00:25:37,888 --> 00:25:44,092
a nearly direct hit from a 15-megaton hydrogen
nuclear bomb, though it does take some time,

266
00:25:44,452 --> 00:25:50,136
sometimes years, for him to fully regenerate.
depending on how heavy the damage is and how

267
00:25:50,176 --> 00:25:56,160
much radiation he's able to feed on. He's essentially
immortal, having survived since prehistoric

268
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:02,665
times. Speaking of radiation feeding, Godzilla
can absorb radiation, allowing him to emit

269
00:26:02,725 --> 00:26:08,809
his signature radioactive energy beam, known
as Atomic Breath. If overloaded with radiation,

270
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:14,333
Godzilla is able to temporarily emit waves in
all directions of destructive nuclear energy.

271
00:26:14,934 --> 00:26:20,835
His amphibious nature allows him to breathe
both on land and underwater, and he has enhanced

272
00:26:20,915 --> 00:26:27,917
senses, able to hear and smell other monsters
across continents and oceans. He's much faster

273
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:34,099
in the water than he is on land, admittedly,
and in the comics, he was susceptible to Shazam's

274
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:40,060
magic lightning bolts. But besides that, the
guy is basically indestructible, and Ultraman

275
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:45,386
is going down. Uh, Ultraman eats kaiju like
Godzilla for breakfast. I just want you to

276
00:26:45,406 --> 00:26:51,493
know that. Oh, really? Yeah. The king of monsters.
I think not. How tall is Godzilla again? 120

277
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:58,962
meters. It's one of the tallest forms of Godzilla.
Oh, wow. That's that's pretty big. All right.

278
00:26:59,783 --> 00:27:03,767
Well, let me go. Tell you how fucked you are
by going through Ultraman's bio. OK. All right.

279
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:09,772
This is the Marvel Comics version of Ultraman
by the way. The character has been around since

280
00:27:09,792 --> 00:27:15,976
the 1950s, but he was recently rebooted in the
Marvel Comics series in 2020. There have been

281
00:27:16,116 --> 00:27:20,679
three mini-series to come out including The
Rise of Ultraman, The Trials of Ultraman, and

282
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,102
The Mystery of the Ultra-7. There are going
to be more produced later including a crossover

283
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:29,706
between Ultraman and the Marvel Super Heroes
universe, but let me go ahead and tell you

284
00:27:29,726 --> 00:27:30,766
about the character's backstory.

285
00:27:35,826 --> 00:27:41,529
a sentient alien race discovered the existence
of kaiju, extra-dimensional monsters that feed

286
00:27:41,589 --> 00:27:46,672
off of negative emotions that were mysteriously
invading reality from beyond the unknown. The

287
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:52,236
aliens learned that the fear the kaiju caused
would create a cyclical loop of negative emotions

288
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:58,039
that would in turn bring more kaiju into the
universe. To stop the monsters, the sentient

289
00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:03,839
alien race had to transcend beyond their normal
state. evolving past negative emotions and

290
00:28:03,879 --> 00:28:10,683
becoming powerful beings of peace, compassion,
and justice. They became Ultra, and used their

291
00:28:10,703 --> 00:28:15,806
privilege to travel the universe and defend
other lifeforms against the Kaiju. In 1954,

292
00:28:16,746 --> 00:28:22,470
mankind became aware that Kaiju were invading
Earth. An international joint effort was created

293
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:28,713
to study and protect the world from the Kaiju,
known as the United Science Patrol, or USP

294
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:35,357
for short. Twelve years later, in 1966, a pilot
for the USP named Dan Moroboshi was investigating

295
00:28:35,517 --> 00:28:41,541
an approaching anomaly from space that was actually
a spaceship belonging to one of the Ultra Aliens

296
00:28:41,861 --> 00:28:46,865
who was coming to Earth to assist the planet
against the Kaiju. The jet and the Ultra's

297
00:28:46,905 --> 00:28:52,088
ship collided, presumably killing each pilot.
Though the wreckage from the alien ship was

298
00:28:52,128 --> 00:28:57,203
too advanced for the USP to understand, They
were able to reverse engineer some of its technology

299
00:28:57,243 --> 00:29:03,107
for use in Earth's battle against the Kaiju.
This included the invention of Keirei's, a

300
00:29:03,147 --> 00:29:08,331
weapon's energy that was subsequently used to
fight Kaiju and shoot down any subsequent spaceships

301
00:29:08,531 --> 00:29:13,675
sent by the Ultra. Throughout the decades, the
USP was able to use this technology to fend

302
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:19,219
off the Kaiju and keep their existence largely
a secret from the world at large. However,

303
00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:25,782
one day in 2010's Japan, a teenager named Shin
Hayata, and his friend Kiki Fujii stumbled

304
00:29:25,802 --> 00:29:31,265
upon a kaiju monster who attacked them. They
were rescued from being eaten by a USP agent

305
00:29:31,565 --> 00:29:36,207
who stepped in to save them. Managing to escape
the incident and avoid having their memories

306
00:29:36,247 --> 00:29:41,869
erased, Shin and Kiki became obsessed with their
knowledge of the kaiju and the USP, whom they

307
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:46,811
refer to as the Ultimate Sneaky People. They
used their knowledge over the years to find

308
00:29:46,851 --> 00:29:51,913
a way to track the kaiju via their energy signature,
and eventually as young adults, they tried

309
00:29:51,953 --> 00:29:58,665
to join the USP. While Kiki passed their recruitment
exam, Shin did not due to his inability to

310
00:29:58,705 --> 00:30:04,730
put aside his own convictions and follow orders.
Kiki went to work studying the Keirei technology

311
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:10,875
at the USP and was eventually pulled into the
field alongside one Captain Muramatsu. The

312
00:30:10,915 --> 00:30:16,419
two were rescued from a kaiju ambush by Shin,
who built his own Keirei blaster and followed

313
00:30:16,459 --> 00:30:22,146
them. Though he was admonished for his unsanctioned
actions, Captain Muramasa trusted Shin enough

314
00:30:22,226 --> 00:30:27,027
to bring him on his and Kiki's next assignment,
which was to investigate the crash site of

315
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:32,289
a downed Ultra spaceship. The captain ordered
Shin to fire on the Ultra emerging from the

316
00:30:32,329 --> 00:30:38,831
wreckage, which he did reluctantly. As the alien
began dying, Shin ignored orders to stay back

317
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:44,552
and sympathetically approached the being, making
contact and merging with the Ultra in order

318
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:50,750
to save its life. The merging process rendered
Shin comatose for 19 hours. During that time,

319
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:56,015
Kiki researched the 1966 crash incident to try
and understand what was happening to Shin.

320
00:30:56,135 --> 00:31:01,880
This led her to the remote cabin of Dr. Yamamoto,
a scientist who was discharged from the USP

321
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:07,645
for arguing against the use of K-Ray technology.
During their meeting, they were attacked by

322
00:31:07,685 --> 00:31:13,070
a Kaiju monster. Shin was able to find Kiki
in time with help from Captain Muramata and

323
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:18,510
transformed into Ultraman for the first time,
defeating the creature. Transforming back,

324
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:23,374
Shin and Kiki learned from Dr. Yamamoto that
their K-rays were not disintegration beams

325
00:31:23,454 --> 00:31:29,279
as they previously thought, but rather teleportation
energy that would transport the kaiju to an

326
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:35,444
unstable pocket dimension called Limbo. With
the vast number of kaiju that the USP had sent

327
00:31:35,485 --> 00:31:40,749
there over the decades, Limbo was starting to
break down, threatening to release every monster

328
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:47,274
ever sent there back on Earth. One such creature,
a giant lizard named Bemular, did manage to

329
00:31:47,294 --> 00:31:52,018
break through the dimensional barrier. Shin
had to transform back into Ultraman and defeated

330
00:31:52,058 --> 00:31:57,243
the creature by growing to his normal, giant
size and fighting it. Now working with the

331
00:31:57,363 --> 00:32:02,887
USP, Shin and Kiki convinced the director that
the best course of action to avoid all the

332
00:32:02,928 --> 00:32:08,712
kaiju in Limbo spilling onto Earth simultaneously
was to slowly allow kaiju through the dimensional

333
00:32:08,753 --> 00:32:14,417
barrier in a controlled manner. This let Ultraman
handle the kaiju crisis around the world methodically.

334
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:19,652
as he took on creatures big and small, the largest
ones typically hiding at the bottom of the

335
00:32:19,732 --> 00:32:24,294
ocean. As the general public became aware of
the Kaiju's existence via Ultraman's battles,

336
00:32:24,894 --> 00:32:30,616
one former USP robotic scientist named Kato
had a protégé that started developing Mecha

337
00:32:30,656 --> 00:32:36,139
Kaiju as a means to convince people that the
USP were untrustworthy. Ultraman defeated the

338
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:42,281
Mechas, though public distrust in the organization
remained. This included Shin's father himself.

339
00:32:42,738 --> 00:32:47,561
resulting in Shin revealing to his dad that
the kaiju were indeed real and that he was

340
00:32:47,641 --> 00:32:52,584
Ultraman. However, Shin's father did not trust
his son with the aliens power, revealing that

341
00:32:52,644 --> 00:32:57,508
he blamed him for the death of his younger brother
Jiro, who was killed accompanying Shin and

342
00:32:57,528 --> 00:33:03,051
Kiki on one of their kaiju hunts as teenagers.
Ultraman sympathized with Shin stating that

343
00:33:03,151 --> 00:33:09,516
he had lost a brother too named Ultra-7, the
Ultra who had crashed with the USP jet back

344
00:33:09,556 --> 00:33:16,591
in 1966. In that crash, the pilot Moroboshi
and Ultra-7 were revealed to have been sent

345
00:33:16,651 --> 00:33:21,512
into Limbo where they merged. After spending
decades fighting an endless battle against

346
00:33:21,552 --> 00:33:27,094
the Kaiju that were being sent there by the
USP, Ultra-7 eventually became corrupted by

347
00:33:27,134 --> 00:33:32,416
the violence. When Ultra-7 arrived back on Earth
through the weakened dimensional barrier, he

348
00:33:32,456 --> 00:33:37,397
went into a frenzy, attacking both Kaiju and
Ultraman, who tried to reason with him and

349
00:33:37,417 --> 00:33:42,728
eventually subdued him. As it turned out, Ultra
7 first came to Earth in the 1960s as he had

350
00:33:42,768 --> 00:33:48,252
gained evidence that the reason Kaiju were appearing
on the planet was due to an external influence,

351
00:33:48,452 --> 00:33:54,837
an evil presence that had embedded itself within
the USP. This led to Shin, Kiki, Ultraman,

352
00:33:55,197 --> 00:34:00,981
Ultra 7, and Jack who was a new combined mecha
version of Ultraman created by the roboticist

353
00:34:01,042 --> 00:34:06,906
Kato and piloted by his teenage children. They
all formed a team called the Ultra Guard. to

354
00:34:06,946 --> 00:34:12,868
combat the USP's corruption. And that's Ultraman's
backstory in Marvel. Powers-wise, Ultraman

355
00:34:12,908 --> 00:34:17,850
possesses enhanced physical abilities due to
his transcendent alien nature. This includes

356
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:24,633
increased strength in excess of 100 tons, flight
speed up to Mach 5, increased durability, and

357
00:34:24,693 --> 00:34:31,336
increased agility. He can grow in size to a
height of 40 meters or 131 feet tall. He also

358
00:34:31,376 --> 00:34:36,514
has a variety of energy weapons, including this
Spacium Beam, which he can fire when forming

359
00:34:36,554 --> 00:34:42,297
his arms into the shape of a plus sign, and
the Ultra Slash, which is an energy buzzsaw

360
00:34:42,317 --> 00:34:47,219
that he can throw out by moving his right arm
in a tomahawk motion. He is a master in his

361
00:34:47,299 --> 00:34:53,161
judo-esque ultra fighting style, and can see
across the electromagnetic spectrum. Lastly,

362
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:58,483
Ultraman is highly intelligent and logical,
able to adapt and process battle strategy on

363
00:34:58,503 --> 00:35:04,206
the fly, with help from the also intelligent
Shin Hayata in his mind. His one weakness is

364
00:35:04,246 --> 00:35:09,631
that Shin can only remain in the Ultraman form
for three minutes before he has to revert back

365
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:15,556
to Shin due to the weakened state of the Ultra
during their merging process. Wow, that's sad.

366
00:35:15,956 --> 00:35:19,919
That's pretty lame, yeah. But three minutes
is all this guy needs. So you're telling me

367
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:27,185
this guy goes up against shrimpy 40 meter tall
Kaiju's? I mean, Ultraman can grow taller than

368
00:35:27,205 --> 00:35:34,497
that too. Oh yeah? Yeah. Are you sure? Well...
He's never done that in the Marvel Comics version,

369
00:35:34,517 --> 00:35:39,826
so I can't say that with 100% certainty, but
at the very least, he's going to be a third

370
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:44,433
the height of Godzilla. This is going to be
fun.

371
00:35:53,222 --> 00:35:59,290
fantasies collide and heroes clash, one podcast
network rises above the rest. Prepare yourself

372
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:05,618

Visit dynamicpodcast.com, where we settle the
debate and settle the score.

378
00:36:40,374 --> 00:36:44,556
But now that we've got the histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

379
00:36:44,616 --> 00:36:51,401
of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not the speculation,

380
00:36:51,701 --> 00:36:57,705
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could
play out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?

381
00:37:09,858 --> 00:37:15,201
For the speculation, the contestants will begin
approximately 50 meters apart in a non-descript

382
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:20,023
environment that will have no bearing on the
match itself, as no environmental statistics

383
00:37:20,063 --> 00:37:25,467
are considered in my simulations. The contestants
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright

384
00:37:25,487 --> 00:37:31,870
then let's get into it. Godzilla and Ultraman
meet! Woah! What's happening here? Wow! Alright,

385
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:37,393
so like in a fiery explosion, the characters
just teleported into our non-environment setting.

386
00:37:37,938 --> 00:37:43,759
where I guess the fight continues from yesterday's
episode of the console combat podcast. So now

387
00:37:43,779 --> 00:37:48,440
that they're here, who's going to go first?
Well, I got to say, you know, the DC Comics

388
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:54,802
version of Godzilla is just so much taller than
Ultraman. He's just going to straight up stomp

389
00:37:54,902 --> 00:37:59,083
Ultraman into the ground, just stepping on him.
It's not going to be that easy, which shows

390
00:37:59,103 --> 00:38:03,865
how smart Godzilla is. Like Marvel's Ultraman
might only be a third of the size of Godzilla,

391
00:38:03,905 --> 00:38:09,282
but he's still incredibly strong, so strong.
that he's gonna catch Godzilla's foot as it

392
00:38:09,322 --> 00:38:15,244
tries to stomp on him, then he's gonna do this
incredible judo slam, throwing the kaiju down

393
00:38:15,324 --> 00:38:20,185
onto the ground and creates this massive Godzilla-shaped
crater. Okay, well you just paced Godzilla

394
00:38:20,285 --> 00:38:27,967
off now. You can see it in his emotive monster-verse
face. So while he's on the ground, Godzilla's

395
00:38:28,047 --> 00:38:34,089
gonna sweep his long tail and smack it right
into Ultraman, sending him flying toward the

396
00:38:34,129 --> 00:38:39,883
horizon. Okay, but like... Ultraman can fly,
so yeah, he gets smacked to the horizon, but

397
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:44,985
he just comes racing back into the battle at
Mach 5 and just rockets his fist right into

398
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:49,867
Godzilla's jaw at five times the speed of sound.
And that's just gonna shatter all of Godzilla's

399
00:38:49,907 --> 00:38:57,230
teeth. So now we just have Toothless Godzilla,
just gums. Uh, no, I'm gonna say Ultraman rocketed

400
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:04,173
his fist right into Godzilla's bite. So Ultraman's
trapped in Godzilla's jaws. And while Ultraman

401
00:39:04,213 --> 00:39:10,108
is locked there, That's when Godzilla's back
dorsal plates began to glow blue, and he's

402
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:15,992
just gonna fry Ultraman with his atomic breath
point blank. No, I mean, that takes a while,

403
00:39:16,032 --> 00:39:20,574
right? So Godzilla never gets a chance. Because,
like, Ultraman, yeah, his arm is trapped in

404
00:39:20,614 --> 00:39:25,857
Godzilla's teeth, but with his other arm, he's
gonna send out an Ultra Slash, and that energy

405
00:39:25,957 --> 00:39:31,701
buzzsaw thing is just gonna rip right into Godzilla's
neck, just severing his ability to use his

406
00:39:31,741 --> 00:39:38,408
atomic breath. about that it's definitely gonna
hurt Godzilla you know and cause him to drop

407
00:39:38,508 --> 00:39:46,054
Ultraman and by drop I mean drop kick like Spartan
style and that's when Godzilla is gonna let

408
00:39:46,074 --> 00:39:52,458
out this deafening roar that's just gonna stun
Ultraman long enough to get body slammed by

409
00:39:52,498 --> 00:39:58,202
Godzilla like Godzilla is just gonna drop right
on top of him and stay on top of him for you

410
00:39:58,222 --> 00:39:59,603
know whatever time remains in

411
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:09,344
Yeah, Shin's time limit is probably coming up
in his Ultraman form. So yeah, he has to do

412
00:40:09,384 --> 00:40:15,567
something drastic. So he summons all of his
might to lift Godzilla's fat ass off of him,

413
00:40:16,047 --> 00:40:20,089
and then he's gonna handspring back onto his
feet, and then he's gonna do his space-ium

414
00:40:20,149 --> 00:40:25,791
beam technique, you know, forming his forearms
into a plus sign, which unleashes this devastating

415
00:40:25,971 --> 00:40:30,753
energy blast that is just gonna disintegrate
Godzilla. Okay, but like in the time it takes

416
00:40:30,873 --> 00:40:36,465
Ultraman... to do this jutsu dance move with
his arms, you know, that's the same amount

417
00:40:36,505 --> 00:40:41,488
of time it takes Godzilla to counter with a
beam of his atomic breath, causing the two

418
00:40:41,548 --> 00:40:47,572
energies to collide and form a massive explosion.
Whoa, whoa, what's happening? They're being

419
00:40:47,652 --> 00:40:55,878
sucked into another vortex. And they're gone.
AJ 9K, status report, please. Reading anomaly

420
00:40:55,938 --> 00:41:00,881
energy signature. The combatants are traversing
via interdimensional portal to the Max Destruction

421
00:41:00,921 --> 00:41:07,550
podcast. Estimated time of arrival tomorrow.
Okay, well, I guess we'll figure out what happens

422
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:12,834
with these two characters tomorrow on the Max
Destruction podcast Just before the characters

423
00:41:12,874 --> 00:41:18,279
left though. I was able to glance at their stats
and the comic versions are pretty impressive

424
00:41:18,339 --> 00:41:22,622
specimens Yeah, they definitely both have a
lot going for each other They're both incredibly

425
00:41:22,662 --> 00:41:28,126
destructive characters able to level whole cities
in their battles, but You know, Godzilla is

426
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:34,208
just so insanely strong and durable. Although
you can't discount Ultraman's agility and his

427
00:41:34,288 --> 00:41:38,889
fighting skill and his intellect. You know,
Godzilla is a big dumb comparatively. Yeah,

428
00:41:38,909 --> 00:41:43,590
but Godzilla did get the edge when it came to
perception because he's able to sense monsters

429
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:49,112
from an entire continent away. Who needs perception
when you have speed? You know, Ultraman's faster

430
00:41:49,152 --> 00:41:55,554
than Godzilla. Who needs speed? We've got fucking
atomic breath. It'll be interesting to see

431
00:41:55,594 --> 00:42:00,739
who wins when we finally get the results of
this match on Thursday on the Senjoworld podcast.

432
00:42:00,759 --> 00:42:05,162
So if you guys want to know who wins, be sure
to continue on with the DynaMic Podcast Network.

433
00:42:05,583 --> 00:42:10,927
Tomorrow you get to hear hosts Ken and Scotty
talk about movie versions of the two characters

434
00:42:10,967 --> 00:42:16,632
fighting and on Thursday, host Zach is going
to be breaking down really powerful anime versions

435
00:42:16,672 --> 00:42:21,358
of the characters. You do not want to miss it.
And again, don't miss out on yesterday's episode

436
00:42:21,398 --> 00:42:25,639

video game versions of Godzilla and Ultraman.
