This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,334 --> 00:00:29,175
And welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:34,756
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:41,278
I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm his twin brother
Johnny DC. And in lead up to Independence Day,

5
00:00:41,638 --> 00:00:46,700
the day after tomorrow, we are going to find
out who would win in a fight between the DC

6
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:55,374
superhero character of Uncle Sam, the personification
of the US spirit of patriotism. Captain Britain,

7
00:00:55,454 --> 00:01:02,597
the UK's premier superhero. We're taking it
back to 1776 folks, and I gotta say, I think

8
00:01:02,637 --> 00:01:07,859
Britain's gonna win this time. All I know is,
just like in the past, US is totally stomping

9
00:01:07,919 --> 00:01:14,202
on Britain. Like there's no way. Not the Sam's
going down. Never, never fucking America. We'll

10
00:01:14,262 --> 00:01:18,344
see. Before we go over the characters' backgrounds
and put their stats from simulations and find

11
00:01:18,384 --> 00:01:22,265
out who would win, we're gonna break down the
latest comic book movie news to come out this

12
00:01:22,305 --> 00:01:27,167
past week. of which we have three news items,
the first one being the massive amount of set

13
00:01:27,207 --> 00:01:32,489
photos that we've gotten from the Superman film
that's currently filming in Cleveland. We also

14
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:39,292
got a trailer for Hitmonkey Season 2 and a trailer

37
00:03:38,813 --> 00:03:45,392
to the no prize. A No Prize is an award Marvel
used to give out to fans. Our version, the

38
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:50,615
Dynamic duel No Prize, is a digital award we
post on Instagram for the person that we feel

39
00:03:50,655 --> 00:03:57,639
gave the best answer to our question of the
week. Last week we asked, besides Batman, what

40
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:03,742
character do you most hope to see in the Penguin
Max series and why? And of course this question

41
00:04:03,782 --> 00:04:09,085
was a tie-in to the first trailer for the Penguin
series that will be coming up soon on the Max

42
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:13,963
platform. We got a whopping two answers. So
let's go ahead and break down our honorable

43
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:19,684
mention and the no prize winner. The honorable
mention goes to Miggy Matagian who said. Hey,

44
00:04:19,704 --> 00:04:25,466
what's up guys, this is Miggy. And the character
I want to see the most, I most hope to see

45
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:33,768
in the Penguin is Arnold Flass, Jim Gordon's
corrupt detective partner. He was just like

46
00:04:33,788 --> 00:04:37,689
the first character that came to mind when I
heard the question. Like he's from like Batman

47
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:41,162
year one. I think it would just be like. Great
for the grounded safe they're taking with the

48
00:04:41,182 --> 00:04:46,664
Penguin because he's like a corrupt, corrupt
detective that sells drugs or takes drugs or

49
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:52,187
something. Yeah, thanks guys. Yeah, like Miggy
said, Flass is a corrupt detective within the

50
00:04:52,227 --> 00:04:59,630
GCPD. He played a fairly heavy role in comics
like Batman Year One, and we actually saw him

51
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:05,392
in the Batman Begins movie. He was the fat cop
with the beard. Yeah, he was the guy who was

52
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:10,939
dropped from the fire escape by Batman in Batman
Begins. Right, exactly. I figured that he would

53
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:17,103
have played a major role in the GCPD television
series that they were talking about doing.

54
00:05:17,504 --> 00:05:22,007
I think that later evolved into an Arkham series
and I'm not sure where it is right now. But

55
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:27,050
yeah, it would be interesting to see other police
officers besides Jeffrey Wright's Gordon pop

56
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:31,454
up in The Penguin. And if any of them popped
up, you would imagine it would be someone like

57
00:05:31,494 --> 00:05:37,558
Flass because he probably has dealings with
organized crime given that he's corrupt. Yeah,

58
00:05:37,598 --> 00:05:43,281
this is a very practical answer given that the
world of the Batman and this Penguin series

59
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:48,884
is very grounded and very rooted in the crime
genre. Detective Flass is very much a part

60
00:05:48,904 --> 00:05:53,226
of that world and it would make sense for him
to show up. Great answer, Miggy, but the winner

61
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:59,570
of this week's No Prize is Travis Herndon, who
said, What's up, Dynamo dudes? Travis here.

62
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:04,192
Shout out to my other twins. So my answer would
have to be Killer Croc. I think he can easily

63
00:06:04,232 --> 00:06:09,404
fit in this Batman universe. You can either
have him be a bodyguard to the Penguin or some

64
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:14,668
other rival gangster, or even have him be his
own gangster like he was in the comic books

65
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:20,092
before. He became a muscle for other people,
you know, give him that same sort of like makeup

66
00:06:20,112 --> 00:06:25,916
that he had a suicide squad and bam, you got
yourself a cool killer croc. Yeah. The gangster-esque

67
00:06:26,116 --> 00:06:31,841
killer croc that we got in the suicide squad
actually was not the worst interpretation of

68
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:37,040
that character. I don't know if you could go
that far with it for a series like The Penguin.

69
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,683
In the comics sometimes Killer Croc is just
depicted as a big guy with a skin condition.

70
00:06:42,264 --> 00:06:47,367
And I think you could definitely go that route
for The Batman, which again, like you mentioned,

71
00:06:47,548 --> 00:06:53,191
is fairly grounded. Honestly, the more bat villains
we get in here though, the better. I would

72
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:58,315
love to see Matt Reeves' interpretation of all
of them. Yet it's always hard for me to accept

73
00:06:58,435 --> 00:07:05,627
altered origins to characters within a gritty
grounded setting like this because it doesn't

74
00:07:05,647 --> 00:07:10,369
feel true to the comic book origins. So like
if Matt Reeves were to include a character

75
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:15,211
like Killer Croc within the universe of the
Batman and Penguin, it would definitely be

76
00:07:15,231 --> 00:07:19,313
a different take on the character. Like he would
just be a guy whose teeth are filed into points

77
00:07:19,353 --> 00:07:23,755
or something and they say he looks like an alligator
or something like something really grounded

78
00:07:23,775 --> 00:07:29,710
and lame like that, you know? Maybe like tattooed
scales or something, contact lenses. That would

79
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:34,713
be lame. If I saw that version of Killer Croc,
I'd be like, Oh, okay. They did it better in

80
00:07:34,753 --> 00:07:40,537
the last cinematic universe. Maybe they could
retain the continuity from the Peacemaker television

81
00:07:40,577 --> 00:07:47,842
series and have Aquaman be a guy who fucks fish.
And Killer Croc is just the offspring of a

82
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:54,667
relationship between Aquaman and a crocodile.
Considering that was the DCEU, not gonna happen.

83
00:07:55,387 --> 00:08:00,891
Oh, yeah, that's true. The Batman's not in the
DCEU. Okay, makes sense. But also how dare

84
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:05,033
you for bringing that up again. Everyone forgot
about it, you just reminded everyone. Aquaman

85
00:08:05,073 --> 00:08:09,436
fucks fish. So great answer Travis, you win
this week's no prize. If you the listener want

86
00:08:09,476 --> 00:08:13,539
a shot at winning your own no prize, stay tuned
to later on this episode when we'll be asking

87
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,881
another question of the week. And now that that's
done, on to the news.

88
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:28,914
Okay, so last week there were leaked set photos
from the Superman movie directed by James Gunn

89
00:08:29,214 --> 00:08:35,720
revealing the full suit of David Cord sweat's
Superman character. Of course, we got our first

90
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,645
look at the character a little over a month
ago in a kind of a bizarre official photo of

91
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:46,869
Superman sitting down like in an apartment putting
boots on with this like giant space laser in

92
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:52,251
the background. People didn't love that. We
commented on it and we kind of agreed that

93
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:58,552
it was unusual. But I gotta say, after seeing
these set photos, I'm actually really loving

94
00:08:58,632 --> 00:09:03,074
this costume. It does look really good. I have
to say, it might be one of my favorites now.

95
00:09:03,254 --> 00:09:09,856
It's very inspired by the new 52 Superman outfit,
but it has the red trunks and of course the

96
00:09:09,876 --> 00:09:16,157
Kingdom Come logo style. So it's a nice amalgam
of a lot of great Superman elements over the

97
00:09:16,197 --> 00:09:21,327
decades. Yeah, my favorite thing I think is
just the colors. You know, Christopher Reeves'

98
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:27,150
Superman had a very like baby blue with a like
a red cape thing kind of going. Henry Cavill

99
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:33,312
had something that was much darker in tone.
But to me, this hits a perfect blend between

100
00:09:33,353 --> 00:09:38,095
the two. The red is still very vibrant, but
the blue is not quite as dark. It's a little

101
00:09:38,115 --> 00:09:43,937
bit brighter. And I think it's a great interpretation
of Superman just as this bright symbol for

102
00:09:43,977 --> 00:09:49,516
people to look up to. Well, it's a very colorful
costume, right? Actually, every character that

103
00:09:49,536 --> 00:09:54,100
was revealed in the set photos appears to be
quite colorful in a comic book sort of way.

104
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:00,124
Like look at Lois Lane, who is wearing purple
and her outfit is very heavily inspired by

105
00:10:00,344 --> 00:10:04,828
what Lois Lane wore in the animated adventures
cartoon. Well, not just that cartoon. Lois

106
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:09,011
Lane actually wears purple a lot in the comics
as well. But I love the fact that we get to

107
00:10:09,051 --> 00:10:14,306
see her in purple. The actress who plays her,
Rachel Brosnahan. Looks like the character

108
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:19,368
to a T. I swear she was born to play the character.
I like the colorful cast of characters that

109
00:10:19,388 --> 00:10:24,731
we got from The Daily Planet, including Cat
Grant, Steve Lombard, Jimmy Olsen, Perry White.

110
00:10:24,811 --> 00:10:30,173
They all look really good. Yeah, they all look
fantastic. But my favorite look of the character

111
00:10:30,193 --> 00:10:35,175
that we got besides Superman is actually Mr.
Terrific, a member of the JSA, although I'm

112
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:39,797
not sure if he's going to be a member of the
JSA in this movie. Mr. Terrific is played by

113
00:10:39,897 --> 00:10:44,691
Eddie Gathegi. Although I didn't really recognize
him from the set photos. The T-mask that he

114
00:10:44,711 --> 00:10:49,132
wears over his face and hairstyle gives him
this sort of different look, I would say. I

115
00:10:49,152 --> 00:10:53,093
can't wait to see like all of the T spheres
moving around him. And I hope they interpret

116
00:10:53,113 --> 00:10:57,654
the character that way. We also got to look
at Lex Luthor, played by Nicholas Holt, who

117
00:10:57,674 --> 00:11:00,655
looks really good in the role with the bald
head. Yeah, it looks like a bunch of scratches

118
00:11:00,695 --> 00:11:04,416
and bruises. It looks like maybe Superman saved
him from an accident or something like that.

119
00:11:04,536 --> 00:11:09,458
But he's also not the only villain we got to
see. We also got to see the engineer. and some

120
00:11:09,518 --> 00:11:15,060
mysterious man in a black costume. We're not
sure who he is, but it looks like they're arresting

121
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:21,343
Superman along with the military, which kind
of harkens back to Man of Steel. But I don't

122
00:11:21,363 --> 00:11:26,345
know. We'll see how this plays out differently
in this film. The one thing I didn't love from

123
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:32,487
all of these set photos was actually Clark Kent.
Yeah, the character of Clark Kent looks vastly

124
00:11:32,527 --> 00:11:37,609
different from Superman, which, you know, is
good in terms of the disguise of Clark Kent.

125
00:11:37,669 --> 00:11:43,434
But. his hair is like so freaking curly, it
makes you wonder how his transformation into

126
00:11:43,474 --> 00:11:48,017
Superman is possible with those two vastly different
hairstyles. And I know Clark Kent is supposed

127
00:11:48,037 --> 00:11:54,062
to look dorky, but damn, he looks really dorky.
So you guys were making fun of his look on

128
00:11:54,122 --> 00:12:00,488
the Discord. You were calling him Superm Man.
Right, insinuating that he gets a perm to be

129
00:12:00,608 --> 00:12:06,032
Clark Kent. But I came up with the theory that
the way he gets his hair a little bit more

130
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:10,027
straight when he transforms into Superman, is
just by heat visioning his hands so they get

131
00:12:10,047 --> 00:12:15,010
really hot and just brushing them through his
hair so it acts like a flat iron. Which is

132
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:22,115
a horrible theory. Truly horrible. And yet it's
a theory nonetheless. Hahaha. But all in all,

133
00:12:22,635 --> 00:12:28,259
I actually really got excited by all of these
photos. I cannot wait for this movie which

134
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:32,982
comes out in a year. It's gonna be a really
long year, that's all I know. We don't usually

135
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:37,045
comment on set photos, but if you guys have
seen them online, you know that they're substantial

136
00:12:37,085 --> 00:12:42,260
enough. to warrant commenting on and also, you
know, a few of them raise interesting discussions

137
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:48,630
about the plot and the characters, especially
that mysterious man in black photo. But that

138
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,253
brings us to our question of the week.

139
00:12:54,734 --> 00:13:01,155
Who do you think is the mysterious man in black
in the Superman set photos, and why? Record

July 6th. In Marvel News this past week, we

145
00:13:23,691 --> 00:13:28,834
got our first trailer for the upcoming season
of Hit Monkey. This will be season 2, which

146
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:35,359
will be released on Hulu on July 15th, all 10
episodes. Now, we reviewed Hit Monkey season

147
00:13:35,599 --> 00:13:40,983
1 when it came out, and it was actually a surprise
hit. I don't think you and I had any expectations

148
00:13:41,043 --> 00:13:45,726
of what the Hit Monkey show would be, and we
were really pleased with how the show turned

149
00:13:45,806 --> 00:13:50,369
out. It was a whole lot of fun. We rated it
4 stars, and you can listen to our review of

150
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:54,682
season 1. Season 2 looks like it's going to
take place right where season 1 left off, where

151
00:13:54,762 --> 00:14:00,884
Hitmonkey and his Hitman ghost mentor Bryce
are fleeing Japan. They go to New York City

152
00:14:01,164 --> 00:14:05,665
and are in an entirely different environment
in this next season. The way the first season

153
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:12,427
ended, Bryce moved on to the afterlife but made
a deal with Mephisto to come back and resume

154
00:14:12,547 --> 00:14:17,749
as Hitmonkey's personal mentor. It looks like
they just plan on fighting crime in New York

155
00:14:17,789 --> 00:14:23,783
City, but there's a lot of supernatural elements
going down. possibly due to Bryce's deal with

156
00:14:23,883 --> 00:14:26,705
Mephisto, although I don't know if they're gonna
call him Mephisto in the show. I think they're

157
00:14:26,725 --> 00:14:31,868
just gonna call him the devil. But we get introduced
to some new characters, including Eunice, who

158
00:14:31,988 --> 00:14:38,191
is voiced by Leslie Jones. She was Bryce's former
agent. Olivia Munn is gonna be back this season

159
00:14:38,351 --> 00:14:43,334
as Akiko Yokohama, but this time she's gonna
be Lady Bullseye, who's gonna go after Hitmonkey

160
00:14:43,414 --> 00:14:48,157
for his actions in Japan from the first season.
You know, of course, Jason Sudeikis is great

161
00:14:48,277 --> 00:14:52,612
alongside Hitmonkey. They just have a great
dynamic. The show's dialogue is one of its

162
00:14:52,652 --> 00:14:57,557
best features. Actually, the worst feature of
the show is probably the animation, at least

163
00:14:57,597 --> 00:15:01,821
it was for season one. But we didn't really
let that deter us from enjoying the show. But

164
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:06,565
I have to say that from this trailer, season
two's animation looks like they actually put

165
00:15:06,585 --> 00:15:10,709
a little bit more money into it. I actually
really like the stylish animation of the show.

166
00:15:10,749 --> 00:15:16,886
I think it suits the concept and vibe that they're
giving off. I am... Honestly really pumped

167
00:15:16,906 --> 00:15:21,607
for the show. I didn't even know they were making
a season two until not too long ago Now I was

168
00:15:21,707 --> 00:15:25,188
actually really surprised because I thought
that Marvel Studios was doing away with all

169
00:15:25,228 --> 00:15:30,950
the stuff that wasn't like in their MCU Continuity
so this was a very pleasant surprise Yeah,

170
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,751
hit monkey was a holdover from the old Marvel
television division And I guess it was popular

171
00:15:35,831 --> 00:15:40,852
enough for them to continue the series in a
season two Yeah, I think this was one of two

172
00:15:40,892 --> 00:15:46,426
series that got released through that the other
one being Modok, right? Yeah, but Modok only

173
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:51,750
had one season, which is also a shame because
I actually really liked Modok. Hitmonkey season

174
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:57,694
one was great for its action, its tremendous
over-the-top violence, and that humorous dialogue.

175
00:15:57,994 --> 00:16:02,317
It's just a great show. If you haven't checked
out season one, definitely check it out and

176
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:06,640
then catch up on season two and listen to our
reviews. You only have a few weeks to catch

177
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:12,904
up on season one because, again, season two
drops on July 15th. On the DC side of animation,

178
00:16:12,945 --> 00:16:18,959
we got our first trailer. for the first season
of Batman Caped Crusader, a television series

179
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,961
that's coming out on Amazon Prime. It was created
by Bruce Timm, who also created the Batman

180
00:16:25,101 --> 00:16:30,983
animated series that began in the 90s, and it's
very much in that same Bruce Timm style, except

181
00:16:31,263 --> 00:16:36,925
it definitely looks like it has a darker, more
noir, more mature approach. Which, you know,

182
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:41,662
if you know anything about Bruce Timm as a fan
of the comics, He tends to make things that

183
00:16:41,682 --> 00:16:45,804
are a little bit more mature when it's not made
for Saturday mornings. And this definitely

184
00:16:45,824 --> 00:16:51,626
looks like it's a little bit in keeping with
that old Max Fleischer, 1940s kind of style

185
00:16:51,906 --> 00:16:56,848
that he originally wanted to emulate in his
Batman series. This of course follows Batman

186
00:16:56,988 --> 00:17:03,111
in his early years as a caped crusader. So we
get early looks at characters like Catwoman

187
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:08,053
and Two-Face. You know, we get to see him back
when he was Harvey Dent. And I gotta say, the

188
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:14,662
character designs... of villains like Two-Face
and Scarecrow go so much harder than they did

189
00:17:14,842 --> 00:17:20,307
in the original animated series. Yeah, they're
very grotesque, almost like the Dick Tracy

190
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:25,572
villain approach. Yeah, which makes it feel
like so much more pulpy, I would say, and so

191
00:17:25,612 --> 00:17:31,877
much more noir, which I didn't think would be
possible, but it apparently is. The voice cast

192
00:17:31,938 --> 00:17:39,924
for this show is amazing. I'm not too familiar
with his work, but he does a pretty good impression

193
00:17:40,004 --> 00:17:45,089
of Kevin Conroy, I would say. Yeah, he was in
the Legion television series as well as the

194
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:50,553
first Fantastic Four movie as Dr. Doom's assistant.
Oh, okay. Okay. So he's had quite a few roles

195
00:17:50,593 --> 00:17:55,918
within the superhero world. Catwoman is going
to be voiced by Christina Ricci. This new version

196
00:17:55,958 --> 00:18:02,303
of Harley Quinn is voiced by Jamie Chung. And
Diedrich Bader, who has voiced Batman in shows

197
00:18:02,343 --> 00:18:06,466
like Batman Brave and the Bold and the Harley
Quinn animated series, is doing the voice of

198
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:11,548
Harvey Dent in Two-Face. Looks like there's
gonna be a ton of action in this show based

199
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:16,830
on this trailer, where we get to see, you know,
Batman slinking through mist and shadow to

200
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,972
take down gun-wielding bad guys, and there's
like explosions and everything. It's pretty

201
00:18:21,012 --> 00:18:25,714
wild. I expect the show to be really good, because
you know, Bruce Timm has already shown that

202
00:18:25,754 --> 00:18:30,877
he's had an incredible take on the character
from his prior work, but also because it's

203
00:18:30,957 --> 00:18:36,895
produced by Matt Reeves. and JJ Abrams, which
is fascinating. Yeah, Matt Reeves, you know,

204
00:18:36,935 --> 00:18:42,357
being the guy who directed the recent The Batman
movie with Robert Pattinson and JJ Abrams being

205
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:47,440
a prolific director and producer in his own
right. Early days Batman has always been a

206
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,582
very interesting Batman to me, and I can't wait
to see how this compares to things like Batman

207
00:18:52,622 --> 00:18:57,964
Begins or The Batman. Or Batman Mask of the
Phantasm, which we recently reviewed just a

208
00:18:58,004 --> 00:19:03,051
few weeks ago and also took place during Batman's
early years as a crime fighter. Right, exactly.

209
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:08,359
All 10 episodes are dropping simultaneously
on August 1st on the Amazon Prime platform.

210
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,107
So if you don't subscribe to that, definitely
make sure you do it by August 1st because we'll

211
00:19:13,147 --> 00:19:17,113
be watching this, we'll be reviewing it, and
I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

212
00:19:24,494 --> 00:19:27,758
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and get into

213
00:19:27,798 --> 00:19:34,166
our main event where we find out who would win
in a fight between the USA's Uncle Sam and

214
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:36,148
the UK's Captain Britain.

215
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:56,852
Alright, Uncle Sam versus Captain Britain. Now
this is the personification of US patriotism

216
00:19:56,912 --> 00:20:02,894
versus the UK's greatest hero. We are taking
it back to the early days of America's history

217
00:20:03,074 --> 00:20:08,336
when they fought for independence from Great
Britain. And we're gonna see if, you know,

218
00:20:08,356 --> 00:20:13,278
that sticks or if, you know, the UK is gonna
be able to annex America again due to the results

219
00:20:13,298 --> 00:20:19,621
of this match. Holy cow, I didn't know that
much was writing on this. Wow, who knew? Yeah,

220
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:23,379
the battle was not over. This will be the final
bout. We'll see what happens. Winner takes

221
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:28,441
all. Down with the monarch. Yeah, I don't know
much about Uncle Sam as a comic book character.

222
00:20:28,521 --> 00:20:32,462
So I'll be interested in seeing what the hell
this guy can do. Yeah, honestly, I didn't know

223
00:20:32,503 --> 00:20:36,924
too much about him prior to this. He's actually
pretty fascinating. That said, I don't know

224
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:41,366
too much about Captain Britain. So honestly,
I don't even know if this is a good matchup.

225
00:20:42,487 --> 00:20:46,068
I don't know if this is gonna be completely
lopsided when it comes to the simulations,

226
00:20:46,569 --> 00:20:51,123
but I think it's gonna be fun nonetheless. To
explain the methodology behind our duels, let's

227
00:20:51,143 --> 00:20:57,766
go to our sentient duel simulator AlfredJarvis9000.
AJ9K, tell our listeners how you go about determining

228
00:20:57,846 --> 00:21:03,069
a winner in our duel matchups. Yes, of course
sir. The way I determine a winner between the

229
00:21:03,109 --> 00:21:09,133
contestants is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations
using the characters statistics. A Monte Carlo

230
00:21:09,173 --> 00:21:13,455
simulation is a probabilistic model used to
determine outcomes through random sampling.

231
00:21:13,895 --> 00:21:18,786
In this case, I randomize the statistics along
a normal distribution. as a way to simulate

232
00:21:18,806 --> 00:21:23,388
the many variables that can occur during battle.
The stat parameters are based on the official

233
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:28,770
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat

234
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:34,333
categories are included such as range, damage
potential, versatility and perception in order

235
00:21:34,353 --> 00:21:39,775
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.
The results of the 1000 simulations provide

236
00:21:39,795 --> 00:21:44,157
a percentage of wins for each character. The
contestant with the higher percentage is declared

237
00:21:44,197 --> 00:21:49,479
the victor. as they have a higher probability
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,

238
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:54,660
neither character should win 100% of the matches.
The comic book stories have shown that there's

239
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,602
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so
the confidence rate of my method falls in line

240
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:04,223
with the precedents that have been established
in the source material. My mathematical simulations

241
00:22:04,263 --> 00:22:09,404
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes

242
00:22:09,464 --> 00:22:15,599
tabulated for determination of the winner. Thanks,
AJ9K! Before we run the simulations though,

243
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:20,822
we like to break down each character's histories
and abilities before improvising a scenario

244
00:22:20,902 --> 00:22:26,466
on how we imagine one of the 1,000 simulations
would play out beat for beat. And I believe

245
00:22:26,506 --> 00:22:32,351
it's my turn to go first with a DC character,
so let me tell you all about Uncle Sam. On

246
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:39,956
July 4th, 1776, shortly after signing the Declaration
of Independence, three of the country's founding

247
00:22:40,036 --> 00:22:46,461
fathers, Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and Thomas
Jefferson were tasked with creating a seal

248
00:22:46,701 --> 00:22:52,965
for the newly formed United States of America.
Conspiring to imbue their seal with spiritual

249
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:59,730
and mystic power, they gathered ten other occult-minded
men from the other colonies to form a group

250
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:06,394
of thirteen, including a rational alchemist
and patriot named Taylor Samuel Hawk, who led

251
00:23:06,435 --> 00:23:12,354
them in a mystic ritual to forge a spirit of
liberty and freedom. of the American Dream

252
00:23:12,414 --> 00:23:18,218
itself. The Thirteen successfully bound the
spirit to a powerful talisman, which became

253
00:23:18,278 --> 00:23:24,062
engraved with an eagle on one side and an eye
of providence surrounded by thirteen stars

254
00:23:24,183 --> 00:23:29,646
on the other. The talisman was entrusted to
the care of Taylor Samuel Hawk, known as Samuel,

255
00:23:30,027 --> 00:23:35,370
who soon became embroiled in the Revolutionary
War. While helping a wagon train of supplies

256
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:40,654
get to George Washington and his troops, he
was spotted by a group of Hessians. German

257
00:23:40,734 --> 00:23:45,877
soldiers who had been hired by the British crown
to help stop the colonial uprising in America.

258
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:51,861
Risking his life to distract the Hessians from
following Washington's supply wagons, Samuel

259
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:57,085
goaded the Hessians into following him, though
they eventually caught up and beat him, and

260
00:23:57,125 --> 00:24:03,289
left him for dead. Dying with the American talisman
in his hand, the spirit of America awakened

261
00:24:03,689 --> 00:24:05,350
and merged with Samuel's body.

262
00:24:10,294 --> 00:24:15,778
known only as the Minuteman, who crossed the
Delaware with and fought alongside Washington.

263
00:24:16,238 --> 00:24:22,243
After the Battle of Yorktown, the spirit faded,
but would return when needed. In the War of

264
00:24:22,324 --> 00:24:29,029
1812, the spirit was known as Brother Jonathan,
who rallied American troops once again to defend

265
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:34,554
against British retaliation. At the start of
the Civil War, the talisman was split into

266
00:24:34,614 --> 00:24:43,556
two pieces, resulting in the and Johnny Reb,
spirits of the North and South. By the 1870s,

267
00:24:44,156 --> 00:24:49,599
the two halves of the talisman eventually came
into possession of a man named Samuel Augustus

268
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:55,583
Adams, a New York cartoonist who criticized
a powerful and corrupt Democrat politician

269
00:24:55,723 --> 00:25:03,267
named William M. Tweed, aka Boss Tweed, who
had Sam Adams assassinated. As Sam lay dying,

270
00:25:03,387 --> 00:25:09,018
both talisman halves in hand, the spirit of
America bound itself to him. creating the first

271
00:25:09,098 --> 00:25:16,405
incarnation of the enduring entity known as
Uncle Sam. Wait, is Uncle Sam the propaganda

272
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:21,910
character actually based off of Sam Adams? It's
a different Sam Adams, not the one you're thinking

273
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:28,536
of. Not the guy who makes the beer? No, not
that one. I see. A second incarnation of Uncle

274
00:25:28,596 --> 00:25:34,060
Sam emerged during World War I, when the spirit
of America was once again bound to a dying

275
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:40,455
American patriot. And a third incarnation emerged
in World War II, during which time he had a

276
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:46,757
young sidekick named Buddy Smith. After Japan's
attack on Pearl Harbor, Uncle Sam created and

277
00:25:46,837 --> 00:25:52,599
led a superteam known as the Freedom Fighters,
which later became a part of a larger wartime

278
00:25:52,639 --> 00:25:59,481
superteam, the All-Star Squadron. After World
War II, racial division, political assassinations,

279
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:05,619
and foreign wars, among other things fragmented
the American talisman into smaller and smaller

280
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:12,643
pieces over the decades as postmodern America's
sense of self deteriorated. Eventually, an

281
00:26:12,683 --> 00:26:18,486
occult group known as the National Interest
performed a ritual to create a sinister spirit

282
00:26:18,806 --> 00:26:24,690
known as Legal Entity to collect all the fragments
of the American talisman. Eventually, they

283
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:30,353
succeeded, though their ritual to summon the
American Dream produced instead a corrupted

284
00:26:30,393 --> 00:26:36,862
version that called itself the American Scream.
This entity, however, was defeated by a new

285
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:43,048
spirit of America, one formed by thirteen American
individuels across the spectrum of race and

286
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:49,694
age that were joined together in a Native American
ritual to form an entity known as Patriot.

287
00:26:50,215 --> 00:26:56,461
Over time, Patriot became the new incarnation
of Uncle Sam, who formed a new version of the

288
00:26:56,501 --> 00:27:00,703
Freedom Fighters. though it wasn't long before
he and the team were seemingly killed by the

289
00:27:00,743 --> 00:27:06,385
secret society of supervillains. The spirit
of America survived, however, and Uncle Sam

290
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:11,788
later emerged from the Mississippi River. Disturbed
by the violent natures of his former teammates,

291
00:27:11,868 --> 00:27:17,770
who now all worked for a US military organization
known as Shade, or the Superhuman Advanced

292
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:23,733
Defense Executive, Uncle Sam convinced them
to defect from Shade and join him in protecting

293
00:27:23,793 --> 00:27:29,124
people as the Freedom Fighters. Eventually,
the Freedom Fighters and Shade joined forces,

294
00:27:29,584 --> 00:27:35,788
and Uncle Sam became the new head of the organization.
After the Flash reset DC's continuity, the

295
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:42,893
multiverse was re-established, and on an alternate
universe of Earth-10, or Earth-X, the Nazis

296
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:48,437
were never defeated and they conquered the planet.
In that world, Uncle Sam and his Freedom Fighters

297
00:27:48,497 --> 00:27:54,521
fought back against the Nazi occupation of America,
though on a day known as Red Friday, they were

298
00:27:54,581 --> 00:28:01,045
all killed. including, seemingly, Uncle Sam,
who faded away. Believing Uncle Sam was still

299
00:28:01,105 --> 00:28:07,069
alive, Adolf Hitler became obsessed with finding
him, as did a new incarnation of the Freedom

300
00:28:07,109 --> 00:28:13,534
Fighters that eventually formed, who were inspired
by the old team and managed to awaken the spirit

301
00:28:13,594 --> 00:28:18,577
of America when they blew up a version of Mount
Rushmore with the faces of Hitler and other

302
00:28:18,637 --> 00:28:25,250
prominent Nazis carved into it. At that moment,
the spirit of Uncle Sam rose from a grave within

303
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:31,552
an extra-dimensional realm of ideas known as
the Heartland, home to other national personifications

304
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:39,516
such as Britannia, Marianne, Hispania, and Johnny
Canuck, all of whom had also seemingly died.

305
00:28:39,936 --> 00:28:45,658
Alongside the freedom fighters, Uncle Sam managed
to deal enough lows to the Nazis to awaken

306
00:28:45,678 --> 00:28:51,681
the other personifications and save the planet
from Nazi rule. And that's Uncle Sam's backstory

307
00:28:51,721 --> 00:28:59,664
so far. Uncle Sam possesses super strength,
speed, and durability commensurate with the

308
00:28:59,764 --> 00:29:05,666
United States' faith in the ideals of liberty
and freedom. Typically, he's been shown to

309
00:29:05,706 --> 00:29:12,489
lift around 50 tons, though he can lift proportionately
more when he grows in size. He can grow as

310
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:18,532
tall as a skyscraper and shrink to 6 inches.
He could also generate portals to teleport

311
00:29:18,552 --> 00:29:25,791
himself and others to and from the Heartland
and he has limited clairvoyance and telepathy,

312
00:29:26,192 --> 00:29:31,155
able to hear and speak through other people's
minds, remotely perceive major events going

313
00:29:31,255 --> 00:29:36,519
on within the United States, and sense the location
of important patriotic artifacts such as the

314
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:42,824
Declaration of Independence. He is, in a sense,
immortal, in that even though his body can

315
00:29:42,844 --> 00:29:49,909
be killed, his spirit will find a new host body
as long as American patriotism exists. And

316
00:29:50,189 --> 00:29:55,039
that's Uncle Sam. You would have to think that
Uncle Sam in this current political climate

317
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:58,741
is probably weaker than he's ever been though,
right? So he's just going to be a pipsqueak

318
00:29:58,761 --> 00:30:04,143
by this point. Dude, I freaking love America.
What are you saying? How dare you? That is

319
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:10,565
as political as the show will ever get. Thank
goodness. That said, nowadays, you know, Uncle

320
00:30:10,605 --> 00:30:15,988
Sam would probably be splintered too. One would
be called Megaman and the other one would be

321
00:30:16,028 --> 00:30:20,914
called the Progressive. I'd read that comic,
honestly, that'd be pretty interesting. I just

322
00:30:20,934 --> 00:30:25,756
gotta say that Captain America will always be
a better symbol of American freedom than this

323
00:30:25,836 --> 00:30:31,898
Uncle Sam guy will ever be. WHAT? Just for the
record. Oh my gosh, he's literally Uncle Sam.

324
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:37,160
Who cares? Steve Rogers. And I'll say that no
one can represent the UK quite like Captain

325
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:42,963
Britain. Let me get into his backstory. Now,
Brian Braddock was born in Malden, Essex in

326
00:30:42,983 --> 00:30:49,265
the United Kingdom. His father was Sir James
Braddock, a champion of the realm of Avalon.

327
00:30:49,686 --> 00:30:54,907
which is similar to the realm of Asgard where
Thor is from, but Avalon is Celtic in nature

328
00:30:55,107 --> 00:31:00,249
as opposed to Norse. Ser James Braddock was
a knight who was sent by the wizard Merlin

329
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:05,430
to Earth's realm in order to sire the hero Captain
Britain, who would serve as the guardian to

330
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:11,492
Avalon's gateway hidden within the British Isles.
Ser James sired a pair of twins, Brian and

331
00:31:11,532 --> 00:31:16,453
his sister Betsy. While it was his sister Betsy
that would develop mutant abilities and later

332
00:31:16,493 --> 00:31:21,343
be known as Psylocke, It was Brian that would
eventually take on his birthright to become

333
00:31:21,403 --> 00:31:27,085
Captain Britain. You can learn more about Psylocke
in her duel against Gorilla Grodd. Brian's

334
00:31:27,145 --> 00:31:32,587
time to don the mantle came shortly after his
parents died. While he was attending Thames

335
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:38,370
University in London, a mercenary named Reaver
and his crew raided the physics research lab

336
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:43,612
that Brian was studying at in order to steal
the experiments. Brian fled the scene on his

337
00:31:43,692 --> 00:31:50,511
motorcycle, but was chased down by the mercenaries
and rode Bleeding and dying, Brian was visited

338
00:31:50,551 --> 00:31:55,513
by the wizard Merlin and his daughter, known
as the Lady of the Northern Skies. Telling

339
00:31:55,553 --> 00:32:00,655
him that he could live to serve as Great Britain's
protector, they offered Brian a choice between

340
00:32:00,755 --> 00:32:07,419
two magical artifacts. The Sword of Might, or
the Amulet of Right? Seeing himself as more

341
00:32:07,439 --> 00:32:12,621
of a scholar than a warrior, Brian chose the
Amulet of Right, which transformed him into

342
00:32:12,701 --> 00:32:17,744
Captain Britain. and bestowed on him great strength
and the Star Scepter which allowed him to fly

343
00:32:18,105 --> 00:32:23,248
and create magic force fields. The Mercenary
Reaver happened upon the scene and grabbed

344
00:32:23,328 --> 00:32:28,292
the other artifact, the Sword of Might, which
transformed the Mercenary into an armored knight.

345
00:32:28,712 --> 00:32:34,196
Brian fought and defeated Reaver and his mercenary
crew, passing his first challenge as a hero.

346
00:32:34,617 --> 00:32:39,200
He would go on to fight other threats to Great
Britain, including Lord Hawk, the Black Baron,

347
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:43,963
and the Lurker from Loch Ness. He partnered
with other heroes such as Captain America to

348
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:48,925
defeat the Red Skull who had come to Great Britain.
During a flight over the English Channel, Brian

349
00:32:48,945 --> 00:32:53,947
was attacked by Merlin's foes, the Nether Gods,
who forced his plane to crash into the water.

350
00:32:54,408 --> 00:32:59,290
He washed ashore on Cornwall Beach, where the
hero known as the Black Knight discovered him,

351
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:04,953
and the two traveled to Camelot in Avalon, where
together they saved King Arthur's former kingdom

352
00:33:05,013 --> 00:33:09,823
from the evil wizard Mordred. After returning
back to Earth, Brian's abilities were altered

353
00:33:09,843 --> 00:33:14,965
by Merlin so that the magic power of his amulet
and scepter were imbued into Brian himself,

354
00:33:15,305 --> 00:33:20,167
letting him use his powers without the need
of magic artifacts. At one point, he gave up

355
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:24,809
his Captain Britton mantle and passed it on
to his sister Betsy, who at the time had not

356
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:30,131
yet joined the X-Men and was not quite ready
for the task. She nearly died in battle with

357
00:33:30,171 --> 00:33:35,553
an assassin called Slamaster, forcing Brian
to kill the villain. He resumed his mantle

358
00:33:35,653 --> 00:33:40,175
as Captain Britton. and his sister soon joined
the X-Men, where she became the quintessential

359
00:33:40,196 --> 00:33:46,599
hero, Psylocke. When several of the X-Men, including
Psylocke, apparently died, Brian was distraught

360
00:33:46,779 --> 00:33:52,743
and was inspired by Nightcrawler to form a British
mutant team called Excalibur. The initial Excalibur

361
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:59,387
team consisted of Captain Britain, Nightcrawler,
the mutant Kitty Pride aka Shadowcat, Brian's

362
00:33:59,447 --> 00:34:05,350
lover Megan, who was a mutant shapeshifter descended
from mythical fairies, and an alternate universe

363
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:10,414
version of Jean Grey and Cyclops' daughter from
the Days of Future Past timeline called Rachel

364
00:34:10,454 --> 00:34:15,678
Summers, who also went by Phoenix. Excalibur
quickly became Britain's premier superhero

365
00:34:15,718 --> 00:34:21,562
team. When they traveled to the US to aid the
remaining X-Men against the Goblin Queen, Brian

366
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:25,925
learned that his powers were linked to the British
Isles, and that the further he journeyed from

367
00:34:25,965 --> 00:34:31,269
them, the more his powers waned. He was then
given a new costume, which acted as a battery

368
00:34:31,309 --> 00:34:35,712
of sorts, storing mystic energies from Great
Britain so that he could more easily use his

369
00:34:35,752 --> 00:34:41,496
powers away from his homeland. This inadvertently
caused Brian to grow in size during a time

370
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:47,140
of cosmic convergence, when multiple realities
aligned and Brian's suit absorbed the mystical

371
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,984
energy of a multitude of Great Britons. The
Excalibur team used this excess energy to defeat

372
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:58,928
a wizard named Necrom, who tried to use the
convergence to become omnipotent. Brian later

373
00:34:58,968 --> 00:35:03,711
learned that his sister Betsy was alive. and
that she had used one of Merlin's artifacts,

374
00:35:03,791 --> 00:35:09,534
known as the Siege Paralys, to let her and several
other X-Men escape death through a mystic portal.

375
00:35:09,994 --> 00:35:16,278
Brian later married Megan in a ceremony in Avalon,
and Excalibur disbanded. After being attacked

376
00:35:16,318 --> 00:35:20,440
by warriors from Avalon, they journeyed to the
realm where Brian received a message from his

377
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,963
father, Sir James, that as Captain Britain,
Brian was the rightful heir of Otherworld,

378
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:32,323
which was a magic dimension that housed the
realm of Avalon. Wielding the blade of Excalibur,

379
00:35:32,683 --> 00:35:37,587
Brian and Megan ruled over Otherworld for a
time, passing the Captain Britain mantle to

380
00:35:37,607 --> 00:35:42,691
a British woman named Kelsey Lee, offering her,
in a moment of near death, the choice between

381
00:35:42,711 --> 00:35:48,556
the Sword of Might and the Amulet of Right.
She chose the sword and served on the Avengers

382
00:35:48,696 --> 00:35:53,520
until the team was disassembled by the Scarlet
Witch in a fit of madness. Brian eventually

383
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:56,763
returned to Earth and formed a new Excalibur
team.

384
00:35:59,938 --> 00:36:04,702
They tried to invade Avalon through the Siege
Perilous portal in order to control Earth's

385
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:09,747
magic. Brian and Excalibur fought and defeated
the aliens, and went on to stop other threats

386
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:14,211
such as the vampire Lord Dracula, whom you can
learn more about in his duel against Andrew

387
00:36:14,231 --> 00:36:19,476
Bennett. Brian left Excalibur for a short stint,
which at this point was rebranded as MI-13.

388
00:36:20,417 --> 00:36:25,421
He joined the Avengers, and later, a secret
group of influential heroes called the Illuminati.

389
00:36:25,858 --> 00:36:30,141
When Captain America's history was rewritten
by the reality warping Cosmic Cube so that

390
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:35,345
he was a secret member of Hydra, Captain Britain
led a team of European heroes to fight against

391
00:36:35,385 --> 00:36:40,109
Hydra's takeover of America. You can learn more
about this event in our Commander Steel vs

392
00:36:40,169 --> 00:36:44,833
Captain America duel episode. After the mutant
population established their own nation on

393
00:36:44,853 --> 00:36:50,618
the sentient island of Kakoa, Brian visited
his sister Betsy, who at this point had resigned

394
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:56,342
the Psylocke identity to the Japanese assassin,
Quanan. Together, Brian and Betsy journeyed

395
00:36:56,382 --> 00:37:01,825
to Avalon, where Brian was put under a spell
by the Arthurian sorceress Morgan Le Fay. Betsy

396
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:06,928
claimed her brother's amulet of right to reassume
the Captain Britton mantle. She formed her

397
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:12,572
own version of the Excalibur team and defeated
Morgan Le Fay, leaving Brian to claim the Sword

398
00:37:12,612 --> 00:37:19,316
of Might, and he took on the new title of Captain
Avalon, his current moniker. I assume Betsy

399
00:37:19,396 --> 00:37:23,666
is going to retain the title of Captain Britton
from here on out. considering she can no longer

400
00:37:23,746 --> 00:37:28,987
be Psylocke, and considering she's more popular
than her brother, Brian. But since we've already

401
00:37:29,047 --> 00:37:34,109
done a duel with Betsy slash Quanan as Psylocke
against Gorilla Grodd, for this duel against

402
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:39,550
Uncle Sam, I'll be going with Brian as Captain
Britain. Powers-wise, Captain Britain gains

403
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:44,572
his abilities from the magical energy stemming
from the gateway to Avalon located in the British

404
00:37:44,772 --> 00:37:49,293
Isles. Traditionally, that meant that the longer
the time and distance he gets from Great Britain,

405
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:53,784
the weaker his power. However, this limitation
has been resolved by the Lady of the Northern

406
00:37:53,844 --> 00:37:59,790
Skies through the use of magic. Captain Britain
has enough strength to lift around 100 tons.

407
00:37:59,870 --> 00:38:05,095
He has enhanced agility and enhanced durability
through a magic invisible force field that

408
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:10,500
encases his body. He occasionally projects this
force field from his body as a ranged attack.

409
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:16,325
Captain Britain can fly up to sonic speeds and
has enhanced hearing and telescopic sight.

410
00:38:16,846 --> 00:38:22,129
Finally, he has a genius level intellect as
an accomplished physicist and engineer. And

411
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:27,413
that's Captain Britain. I thought for some reason
his power set was way different. I thought

412
00:38:27,433 --> 00:38:32,797
he like shot lasers and stuff for some reason.
No, you might be thinking of Vindicator, who's

413
00:38:32,837 --> 00:38:38,941
like the Canadian version of Captain Britain.
Oh, maybe. Yeah. Who the hell is Union Jack?

414
00:38:39,021 --> 00:38:44,045
Isn't he a guy? Yeah, he's also a British hero,
but he's not Captain Britain. They all look

415
00:38:44,065 --> 00:38:49,084
alike. Well, I mean, yeah, they both wear the
British flag, but you should try not to be

416
00:38:49,124 --> 00:38:54,267
racist. Freaking red coats. All of them. I don't
think Uncle Sam would appreciate what you're

417
00:38:54,287 --> 00:38:59,089
saying. Dude, Uncle Sam loves punching red coats.
It's what he does.

418
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:12,142

discover who will emerge victorious. Visit dynamicpodcast.com
where we settle the debate and settle the score.

425
00:39:53,718 --> 00:39:57,420
Well now that we got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

426
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:03,244
of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not the speculation,

427
00:40:03,404 --> 00:40:07,666
but it's fun to imagine how the fight could
play out. AJ and IK, what are the rules of

428
00:40:07,686 --> 00:40:12,609
our speculation? Well I should say there are
no rules, other than the characters have no

429
00:40:12,669 --> 00:40:17,251
prior knowledge of the other going into the
fight. All they are aware of starting out is

430
00:40:17,271 --> 00:40:21,862
that the other character is a threat that needs
to be eliminated. For the speculation... The

431
00:40:21,882 --> 00:40:26,945
contestants will begin approximately 50 meters
apart in a nondescript environment that will

432
00:40:26,965 --> 00:40:32,289
have no bearing on the match itself, as no environmental
statistics are considered in my simulations.

433
00:40:32,589 --> 00:40:37,752
The contestants must earn victory on their own
merit. Alright then, let's get into it. Uncle

434
00:40:37,792 --> 00:40:43,356
Sam and Captain Britain meet on the battlefield.
Who goes first? I'm going to say that Captain

435
00:40:43,396 --> 00:40:47,519
Britain goes first because he can, you know,
fly up to Sonic's speeds. So he's going to

436
00:40:47,559 --> 00:40:52,302
start off by blitzing Uncle Sam and he's just
going to rock that old man. with the massive

437
00:40:52,322 --> 00:41:00,504
haymaker. Elder abuse. Actually, I don't think
Uncle Sam is that old. I think he just has

438
00:41:00,604 --> 00:41:05,006
white hair, but I think he's actually like a
middle-aged man. But anyway, Uncle Sam, you

439
00:41:05,026 --> 00:41:09,867
know, he gets knocked down, but he's gonna get
back on his feet. He's gonna dust himself off

440
00:41:10,407 --> 00:41:15,249
and roll up his sleeves. And he's gonna be like,
all you've done is awaken a sleeping giant

441
00:41:15,649 --> 00:41:21,243
and he's going to grow. into his giant size
right away and grab Captain Britain like he's

442
00:41:21,263 --> 00:41:27,526
an action figure and just crush him in his grasp.
He'll try to crush him in his grasp, but Captain

443
00:41:27,546 --> 00:41:32,167
Britain's force field is gonna keep him from
getting crushed. So he's gonna slip out of

444
00:41:32,388 --> 00:41:38,490
Uncle Sam's grasp and then he's gonna fly over
his head and Captain Britain's gonna grab Uncle

445
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:44,593
Sam by his back collar and he's gonna flip this
geezer right onto his ass with a big ol' massive

446
00:41:44,633 --> 00:41:51,144
crash. Okay, but From the ground, Uncle Sam's
gonna swat at Captain Britain with his top

447
00:41:51,184 --> 00:41:57,287
hat and actually he's gonna trap him in it.
And Uncle Sam's like, all men are created equal,

448
00:41:57,667 --> 00:42:03,090
except for you, pipsqueak. And he's just gonna
throw his hat on the floor and just stomp on

449
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:09,494
it, just crushing Captain Britain beneath his
boot. Oh, wow. Oh, geez. All right. But Captain

450
00:42:09,514 --> 00:42:15,057
Britain is strong enough to burst out of this
hat and he's gonna catch Uncle Sam's boot as

451
00:42:15,097 --> 00:42:20,244
it's trying to stomp on him. And then he's gonna
like Mario 64 him. He's gonna swing him around

452
00:42:20,284 --> 00:42:24,907
and around and around by the leg. And he's just
gonna release him, which is gonna send Uncle

453
00:42:24,927 --> 00:42:30,091
Sam tumbling across the battlefield. And that'll
probably cause him to shrink back down to his

454
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:35,415
normal size. And that is when Captain Britain's
gonna follow up and fly over to Uncle Sam,

455
00:42:35,455 --> 00:42:40,138
who's on the ground, and he's gonna teabag him.
Just like dunk his nuts right on his face repeatedly.

456
00:42:40,638 --> 00:42:46,738
And he's gonna be like, tea time, tea time.
Uncle Sam's gonna be like... No taxation without

457
00:42:46,778 --> 00:42:52,399
representation, bitch. And he's going to grab
Captain Britain by his nuts and just throw

458
00:42:52,419 --> 00:43:00,802
him into the harbor. Harbor? What harbor? The
the Boston Habba. Duh. There's no environment

459
00:43:00,822 --> 00:43:04,483
here. I don't know what you're talking about.
Captain Britain gets thrown by his sack, but

460
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:08,624
he's going to land on the ground. Probably feeling
a little bit sick to his stomach. You know,

461
00:43:08,664 --> 00:43:12,325
probably feels like he's going to puke. Yeah.
And while Captain Britain is recovering, that's

462
00:43:12,365 --> 00:43:17,447
when Uncle Sam. is gonna run up to him and just
start pounding him with his fists, yelling,

463
00:43:17,667 --> 00:43:23,930
for life, liberty, and the pursuit of kicking
your ass! Boom! Captain Britain is knocked

464
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:29,793
out. No, because before Uncle Sam can knock
Captain Britain out, he's gonna project his

465
00:43:29,853 --> 00:43:35,496
force field as a projectile. It's gonna blast
Uncle Sam away, and then Captain Britain's

466
00:43:35,516 --> 00:43:41,579
gonna follow that up with a flying kick to Uncle
Sam's dumb goatee. Actually, Captain Britain,

467
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:45,661
he's just going to fly and kick straight into
the heartland because Uncle Sam's going to

468
00:43:45,701 --> 00:43:52,165
generate this swirling red, white and blue portal
that Captain Britain just essentially falls

469
00:43:52,245 --> 00:43:58,909
into. So now they're both in Uncle Sam's dimension,
this like idealized Norman Rockwell-esque farm

470
00:43:58,929 --> 00:44:05,073
with like bald eagles in the sky. But in this
world, Uncle Sam, he has some degree of reality

471
00:44:05,113 --> 00:44:11,461
manipulation. So he's gonna summon like a whole
bunch of firework explosions that just blast

472
00:44:11,501 --> 00:44:19,026
Captain Britain. He's like, give me liberty
or I'll give you death. Is he speaking quotes

473
00:44:19,046 --> 00:44:26,151
like that? Sometimes. Alright, so Captain Britain
is getting blasted by these fireworks, but

474
00:44:26,191 --> 00:44:32,735
to avoid them, he's gonna use the Siege Perilous
artifact from Merlin to transport himself and

475
00:44:32,916 --> 00:44:38,763
Uncle Sam to the realm of Avalon. And once they're
there, the lady of the lake, she's going to

476
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:43,286
throw the sort of might to Captain Britain.
He's going to catch it and then run the blade

477
00:44:43,706 --> 00:44:49,049
right through Uncle Sam's torso, just impaling
him and ending the match. Wait, so the Siege

478
00:44:49,109 --> 00:44:56,074
Perlis is an artifact? Yeah, yeah, it's like
a brooch that grows to become a doorway. Yeah,

479
00:44:56,154 --> 00:45:00,957
and Eagle snatches it from Captain Britain before
he could even use it. So what? The match was

480
00:45:00,997 --> 00:45:04,786
already over. I don't know what to tell you.
Well, if the eagle snatches it before they

481
00:45:04,806 --> 00:45:10,568
can transport to Avalon, then that means that
this eagle just exploded in the fireworks as

482
00:45:10,588 --> 00:45:15,669
they're going off. Hey, that eagle died for
his country, sir. That eagle is a patriot.

483
00:45:16,109 --> 00:45:19,831
I'm going to say that the actually the eagle
died from the firework explosions before it

484
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:25,432
could snatch the siege perilous. So, yeah, Captain
Britain wins. He takes them both to Avalon

485
00:45:25,812 --> 00:45:31,382
and then Uncle Sam gets impaled. OK, I guess
we'll leave the match there. Either Uncle Sam

486
00:45:31,422 --> 00:45:37,026
gets impaled by the Sword of Might in Avalon,
or Captain Brain gets bombed by a whole bunch

487
00:45:37,066 --> 00:45:41,388
of fireworks in the Heartland. Let's go ahead
and input the character stats, run the simulations,

488
00:45:41,468 --> 00:45:47,292
and find out which of these events happens when
we come back with a winner. AJ9K, hit it! Inputting

489
00:45:47,332 --> 00:45:53,635
data. Running calculations. Processing results.
Simulations complete. Alright this was a pretty

490
00:45:53,655 --> 00:45:56,917
close match, you know, considering that neither
of us really knew much about the other character.

491
00:45:57,430 --> 00:46:01,433
but the executive producers picked this one
out and I think it was a good call. Yeah, I

492
00:46:01,473 --> 00:46:05,236
mean, powers wise, they were pretty similar
and that, you know, they're both really strong

493
00:46:05,276 --> 00:46:11,601
and they could even teleport to like other fantastical
realms, that's crazy. But stat wise, they were

494
00:46:11,762 --> 00:46:16,225
similar as well. Yeah, we said they had about
the same fighting skill and versatility, but

495
00:46:16,245 --> 00:46:24,119
we said Uncle Sam is faster, more durable, stronger.
and capable of more damage and also greater

496
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:29,522
perception because he has like limited omniscience
over the country. Right, exactly. We also said

497
00:46:29,582 --> 00:46:35,726
Captain Britton was more evasive. He had a greater
range because Uncle Sam has no projectile attacks

498
00:46:35,766 --> 00:46:41,689
basically. And surprisingly, Captain Britton
was more intelligent than Uncle Sam. So taking

499
00:46:41,829 --> 00:46:46,992
all of the stats into consideration, Joseph,
who do you think came out on top? I think that

500
00:46:47,032 --> 00:46:51,887
this is the day Britton finally wins. I think
they're going to get their sweet revenge for

501
00:46:52,108 --> 00:46:58,833
what happened all those centuries ago. And America's
going down. Why do you hate America, sir? I

502
00:46:58,873 --> 00:47:04,257
don't hate America, but I do love Marvel. And
Marvel has Captain Britain, who I'm representing

503
00:47:04,317 --> 00:47:09,221
in this match. You're a traitor to your country?
Well, I mean, I'm not the only one who thinks

504
00:47:09,261 --> 00:47:14,065
that Captain Britain will win because according
to the Instagram poll results, it's an even

505
00:47:14,105 --> 00:47:19,777
split 50-50. That's only because I put the poll
up late because we're recording a little bit

506
00:47:19,917 --> 00:47:28,183
early and not enough Americans have seen the
poll yet. But let's find out who won. AG9K,

507
00:47:28,203 --> 00:47:36,829
the results please. Hey Yuasa. The winner of
the matchup between Uncle Sam and Captain Britain

508
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:45,231
is... Uncle Sam, bitch! We lost again. Dude,
you're American. What are you talking about?

509
00:47:45,851 --> 00:47:54,158
Uncle Sam won 546 out of the 1000 matches or
54.6% of the time compared to Captain Britain,

510
00:47:54,519 --> 00:48:00,984
who won 45.4%. That's pretty close, though.
It was close. Too close, if you ask me. You

511
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:05,668
don't think there's any bias at play here with
having America win on the 4th of July, is there?

512
00:48:06,148 --> 00:48:11,913
Well, I mean, unless AJ9K is biased, unless,
you know, math is biased. I guess math just

513
00:48:11,953 --> 00:48:18,765
loves America. And you know this is actually
really fitting because this upcoming week I'm

514
00:48:18,825 --> 00:48:25,589
traveling to our nation's capital Washington
DC. I'm putting a new meaning to DC in Johnny

515
00:48:25,629 --> 00:48:30,511
DC and I would have been really embarrassed
if I had to show my face there with Captain

516
00:48:30,551 --> 00:48:34,574
Britain winning. I mean you should probably
never show your face anywhere if we're being

517
00:48:34,614 --> 00:48:40,037
honest. Dude my face looks like your face. Ah
shit that was a self burn wasn't it? I guess

518
00:48:40,057 --> 00:48:43,171
that does it for this duel. AG9K, help close
us out.

519
00:48:59,454 --> 00:49:05,197
or by rating and reviewing Dynamic Duel on Apple

In our next episode, we will be reviewing a

522
00:49:17,464 --> 00:49:22,927
Marvel animated direct-to-video feature, Hulk
Versus. Right, and the executive producers

523
00:49:22,987 --> 00:49:28,174
chose that movie to review because it features
a Wolverine versus Hulk fight and Wolverine

524
00:49:28,194 --> 00:49:33,018
is going to be appearing in the Deadpool and
Wolverine movie coming out at the end of this

525
00:49:33,058 --> 00:49:37,321
month. So look forward to that. But that does
it for this episode. We want to give a big
