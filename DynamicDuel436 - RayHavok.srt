This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi, welcome to
the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,759
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,360
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Johnny DC and I'm his twin

4
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:45,000
brother Marvelous Joe and in this episode we are
doing a duel between the characters of Rey from DC

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,320
and Havok, Cyclops brother. Yeah, Havok has been
part of the X-Men and X-Factor. He's probably the

6
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,200
biggest X-Men character that we have yet to do a
duel with, although you know we haven't done a duel

7
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,840
with Kitty Pride yet so that needs to happen at some
point. Oh totally. This episode is actually in

8
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:09,620
lead-up to a future team duel we have planned
between the Freedom Fighters and X-Factor since

9
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:15,040
the Rey is a member of the Freedom Fighters. Yeah,
you can expect that team duel next month I believe.

10
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,120
It should be exciting to see who wins between these
two energy-blasting characters but before that

11
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,720
we're gonna break down the latest comic book movie
news that came out this past week. Of which there

12
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:31,100
was one news item and that was the release of the
peacemaker season 2 official teaser. As always we

that out of the way, quick to the no prize! A no prize

30
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,810
is an award that Marvel used to give out to fans. Our
version, the Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital

31
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:25,790
award we post on Instagram for the person that we
feel gave the best answer to our question of the

32
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:31,430
week. Last week we asked you guys including
Deadpool who should be on the roster for the X-Men

33
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:36,490
Deadpool team-up film and this is coming off of the
news that was reported by the trades that Ryan

34
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:41,710
Reynolds has been tapped by Marvel Studios to
write a movie that features Deadpool teaming up

35
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:47,930
with three to four X-Men characters and this film
would be one of two X-Men films set in the MCU that

36
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,090
are currently being written. We got five answers
this past week so let's go ahead and run down our

37
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:57,930
three honorable mentions and the no prize winner.
Our first honorable mention goes to Lorenzo

38
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:04,050
Valdez who said, This is Lorenzo Valdez calling in
again. My pitch for the roster for the X-Men

39
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:09,930
Deadpool team-up film would be alongside
Deadpool of course, Wolverine, Jean Grey and

40
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:15,890
Cyclops and my idea would be that Deadpool would
help them work through their love triangle while

41
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:22,810
simultaneously providing fourth wall breaking
analysis of the love triangle itself. Clonifer

42
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:28,170
everyone always, bye bye. Yeah and I would
actually throw in Emma Frost into the mix and then

43
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:34,270
you could get Deadpool's commentary on this kind
of love quadrilateral as it were. This almost

44
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:40,950
seems like the premise for an adult film. Yeah it
sounds like a parody of an X-Men Deadpool team-up

45
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:45,930
but it made me laugh so you get an honorable
mention. Great answer Lorenzo our next honorable

46
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:52,250
mention goes to Travis Herndon who said, What's up
dynamic dudes Travis here, shout out to me able to

47
00:04:52,250 --> 00:05:00,810
win so my choices would be Deadpool, Colossus,
X-23, Silo, Nightcrawler and Warhead. I think

48
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:08,270
that's a nice little mix with the old Fox X-Men and
then you can introduce the new three new actors to

49
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:14,470
play those three new X-Men characters. It could be
a nice little mix. They can easily play off each

50
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:19,230
other pretty good something similar to the
Thunderbolt so that's it. Yeah I'm not sure who

51
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:24,350
Travis is referring to the old X-Men and who would
be the new but we know that Colossus and Negasonic

52
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:29,670
Teenage Warhead have both been in the Deadpool
films and then you have X-23 who's played by Daphne

53
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,730
Keane, Silo who is portrayed by Olivia Munn in
X-Men Apocalypse and Nightcrawler who of course

54
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:40,050
was portrayed by Alan Cumming next to who will be
reprising the role in Avengers Doomsday. There

55
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:45,030
was also the other version of Nightcrawler that
was in the first class timeline who was played by

56
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:50,690
Cody Smith McPhee. I actually really like that
lineup it's a really cool cast of characters with

57
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:55,730
really cool power sets I would love it if that was
the roster. Yeah I mean you have your strong guy you

58
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:01,310
have your teleporter you have your psychic you
have your blasty girl and then you have your stabby

59
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:07,190
girl it works it works great answer Travis our next
honorable mention goes to Mike Williams who said

60
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:14,430
my roster for a new Deadpool movie would be
Deadpool themselves Wolverine Bishop Warpath

61
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:22,210
and Domino maybe revive the X-Force so that they
don't all die at the end and maybe start an X-Force

62
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:28,510
franchise that's my two cents as always make mine
Marvel. Yeah this would be essentially a new

63
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:33,590
X-Force movie with some of the characters that
were in the Deadpool 2 film like Domino actually

64
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:38,450
just Domino was part of X-Force in that movie but
Warpath is a long-standing member of X-Force in

65
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:43,890
the comic books and he was in X-Men Days of Future
Past he would be a good addition here Bishop was

66
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:48,370
briefly on the X-Force team in the comic books if I
remember correctly I think he was on Storm's

67
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,630
version of the team and then of course Wolverine
obviously was on the Strike Force version of the

68
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:56,710
X-Force team as well so yeah this is a pretty good
lineup too I like the inclusion of Domino

69
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:02,170
specifically. Yeah I felt like she was missing
from the third Deadpool film personally. Yeah

70
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:06,670
yeah same well I think the same thing with Cable too
I think they all had pretty good chemistry in

71
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:12,350
Deadpool 2. I just remembered that Bishop was also
in Days of Future Past. Great answer Mike we want to

72
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,950
give a special thanks to Kat Stevenson who took the
time to respond with their answer they mentioned

73
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:23,090
Cable, Professor X, Nightcrawler and Cyclops
which was a pretty very team with an interesting

74
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:29,310
mix of characters but the winner of this week's No
Prize goes to Gavin Troyer who said I think the

75
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:35,730
Deadpool team-up movie should be an X-Force movie
with Deadpool's supporting character, Silak,

76
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:44,390
Bishop, Forge and Wolverine played by a separate
actor than Hugh Jackman and Deadpool's mini arc in

77
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:50,750
the movie is to move on from Hugh Jackman's
Wolverine and accept that this new actor can

78
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,410
follow his footsteps. Also the actor who's
playing Wolverine now should be Tom Hardy but

79
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:00,150
anyways that's my thoughts. It's an interesting
cast for Wolverine I don't know if the fact that Tom

80
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:05,630
Hardy has played Venom would have any bearing on
him being cast as an MCU Wolverine but beyond the

81
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:10,810
Wolverine casting aspect the thing I liked most
about this answer was the inclusion of Forge.

82
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:15,610
Gavin's answer out of all the answers was the only
one that included a new character from the X-Men

83
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:20,990
comic books that we haven't seen yet adapted to
live action and I'm a big Forge fan so I think that'd

84
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:26,190
be really cool. Yeah if you're not familiar with
Forge we did a dual episode between him and Mr.

85
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:32,409
Terrific. His mutant power is essentially that he
can create anything he can imagine like

86
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:37,730
technology wise. Right exactly not as like a
technopath he's also like engineer the parts and

87
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:42,890
stuff like that but he makes like a great
quartermaster I think for an X-Force team which

88
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:47,710
was his role for both X-Force and X-Factor in the
comic books and also I like the variety in this team

89
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:52,390
I think it would make for a great X-Force film as
well. So great answer Gavin you win this week's No

90
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:57,090
Prize if you the listener want a shot at winning
your own No Prize stay tuned to later on in this

91
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:07,570
episode when we'll be asking another question of
the week. Another that's done? A lot to the news!

92
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:15,670
Okay last week we got the first official teaser for
Peacemaker season two written by James Gunn the

93
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:23,190
new head of DC Studios who previously wrote season
one of the show along with the Suicide Squad film

94
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:28,790
from which John Cena's Peacemaker character
comes from. I loved the Suicide Squad I loved

95
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:33,830
Peacemaker season one and I've really been
looking forward to Peacemaker season two even

96
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:39,690
though I've been kind of confused as to how it fits
in the new universe that James Gunn is

97
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:45,370
establishing considering John Cena's
Peacemaker character comes from the DCEU. Well

98
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:50,290
this trailer did not clear up any confusion
whatsoever in fact it probably made me more

99
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:55,690
confused but I'm also hoping that it clears things
up once we finally watch the show. Yeah not to skip

100
00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:01,370
to the end of the trailer it does look like at some
point Peacemaker goes into his dad's miniature

101
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,770
universe of closets. Yeah his like pocket
dimension where he's able to access the

102
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:11,510
multiverse maybe. Yeah it kind of seems that way
but in the beginning we get to see the new Justice

103
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:15,370
League that's going to appear in the upcoming
Superman film although the Superman movie comes

104
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:23,070
out before this show debuts. Right Peacemaker
goes to an audition in a rundown toy store to meet

105
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:29,050
with Hawke Girl Green Lantern Guy Gardner and
Maxwell Lord played by the same actors who play

106
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:35,150
them in the Superman movie. During Peacemaker's
interview they failed to mute themselves so

107
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:41,390
they're just talking shit about him behind the
glass and it's very humiliating for him. It was a

108
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:46,410
somewhat humorous scene though I'm not sure all of
the actors pulled off the comedy specifically

109
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:52,870
Isabella Merced. We'll see how it goes. What's
interesting is that Maxwell Lord could be twins

110
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:58,870
with Calenderman as he was portrayed in the
Suicide Squad film and he moves a lot like Weasel

111
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:07,110
how weird is that. Now of course Maxwell Lord is
played by Sean Gunn who yes did play Calenderman in

112
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:12,910
the DCEU but he's moved beyond that. He's onto
bigger and better things like the benefactor of

113
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:17,390
the Justice League Maxwell Lord. After the
opening scene for the rest of the trailer we

114
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:23,390
essentially see the old cast from season one
coming to terms with the fact that even though they

115
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:28,430
saved the world they're getting no real
recognition for it and in fact it looks like

116
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:36,890
they're being hunted by Argus formerly run by
Amanda Waller now run by Rick Flagg Sr whose son was

117
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:43,510
killed by Peacemaker in the Suicide Squad film. It
was a very powerful moment in that film so I'm glad

118
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:49,250
they're still able to play up on that as they did in
Peacemaker season one. We get to see Adebayo,

119
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:55,490
Adrian Chase, AK, Vigilante, Harcourt,
Economist all return they're all being their

120
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:01,370
badass hilarious selves. And we get to see Tim
Meadows as one of the agents of Argus it looks like.

121
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:07,310
Yeah he's in the scene where he's giving nicknames
and directions to his Argus crew and they're all

122
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:15,130
fairly insulting. Yeah Mexicali, Ponyboy,
Titties and Ceno Man I thought that was pretty good

123
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:20,870
one. It was interesting to see Tim Meadows here
who's primarily known for his comedic work but it

124
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:25,030
seems like James Gunn has a pretty good
relationship with a lot of SNL actors because

125
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:30,290
we've seen him use like Pete Davidson as
Blackguard in the Suicide Squad and Beck Bennett

126
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:35,210
is going to be in his upcoming Superman movie. Yeah
I'm a big fan of Tim Meadows from his SNL days it's

127
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:41,950
great to see him on this cast surprisingly also we
get a glimpse of Michael Rooker as a character that

128
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:47,490
I have no idea who it is. Some people are saying
Snowflame I don't know if I believe that. I

129
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,630
definitely don't think it's Savant the character
that the actor played in the Suicide Squad

130
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:58,090
considering he's dead so who knows. Yeah James
Gunn likes to work with a lot of the same actors over

131
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:02,730
and over again Michael Rooker you know being the
actor who played Yondu in The Guardians of the

132
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:08,190
Galaxy movies but again we have this weirdness
where Michael Rooker played Savant in the DCEU and

133
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:12,390
he's playing this new character in this new
version of the DC Universe but they could be like

134
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:16,290
twins just like with this Shang-Gun situation
it's a little bit confusing how they're going to

135
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:20,110
pull this off although that's not to say that
Marvel hasn't reused actors in different roles

136
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:25,850
people like Alfred Woodard or something like
that. Yeah or Gemma Chan. Right like I said earlier

137
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:31,070
I'm hoping some of this confusion gets cleared up
once we watch the show I'm definitely fully

138
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:37,770
expecting to love this show and just find it
hilarious and if things get cleared up in the midst

139
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:45,870
of the fun of watching it that's just icing on the
cake. The show premieres on August 21st on Max and

140
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:50,950
we will absolutely be reviewing it once it wraps up
but going back to our discussion of Tim Meadows

141
00:13:50,950 --> 00:14:00,870
that brings us to our question of the week. Cast any
Saturday Night Live actor as a Marvel or DC

142
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:10,430
superhero who would you cast and why? And
portrayed characters in Marvel and DC the most

143
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:16,430
popular of course was Robert Downey Jr who was a
member of the cast for I think like a year but you

144
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:21,510
know he's Iron Man so that doesn't count neither
does Kristen Wiig who played Cheetah in Wonder

145
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:27,850
Woman 1984 or Pete Davidson who again played
Blackguard in the Suicide Squad. There's also

146
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:36,030
Bill Murray who played Lord Krylar in Quantum and
recently Shazir Zamata played Jennifer Kale in

147
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:47,830
Agatha All Along. Would love to get your answers.

152
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:21,910
The Dark Knight's definitive DC comic stories
adapted directly for audio for the very first

153
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:31,170
time. Fear. I have to make them afraid. He's got a
motorcycle. Get after him or have you shot? You

154
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:38,710
mean blow up the building. From this moment on,
none of you are safe. New episodes every Wednesday

155
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:45,690
wherever you get your podcasts. But that does it
for all of the news for this episode so now let's

156
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:52,050
move on to the main event where we find out who would
win between the Freedom Fighter Ray and the

157
00:15:52,050 --> 00:16:13,670
X-Factor member Havoc. Ray vs. Havoc. These
characters were chosen by our executive

158
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:18,810
producers to battle against each other because
they're both energy emitters as it were. They're

159
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:23,030
both fairly popular characters within Marvel and
DC that for some reason we just haven't gotten to

160
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:29,010
yet. Back when I first started reading comics in
the 90s, Ray was all over the place. Not so much

161
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:34,830
lately in the comics, but you occasionally see him
from time to time. He has a cool look to him. So does

162
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:40,190
Havoc I think. They both have pretty cool
headgear. Ray has his like Spartan warrior style

163
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:46,210
helmet and then Havoc has his like tri-pronged
mask thing. Whatever the hell that is. That's

164
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:51,090
weird. I never really liked his look. It's an
interesting look but it's also a weird look. It's a

165
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:57,590
unique look for sure. He did not have this look in
X-Men 1st class when the character was played by

166
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:02,930
Lucas Till. Yeah, he also showed up in X-Men
Apocalypse where it was established that he and

167
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:08,849
Cyclops were brothers. The way they portrayed
Havoc's plasma blasting abilities in the movies

168
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:15,150
was a little unique. You know, they made his plasma
red probably so that it resembled Cyclops powers a

169
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:19,829
little bit more, but traditionally Havoc
emanates the plasma from his body like in all

170
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:25,349
directions and it emanates in waves. And he's also
not able to control that just like his brother

171
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:30,370
Cyclops. Sometimes he is, but most commonly he
wears a containment suit that helps him control

172
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:35,690
and direct his powers. In a similar way that
Cyclops wears his visor that helps him control and

173
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,750
direct his powers. Now you've never seen the Ray in
a live-action movie but he has been in the

174
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:46,590
Arrowverse on live-action television and also he
had his own animated series called Freedom

175
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:51,910
Fighters the Ray, which is pretty Yeah, I never saw
that but his power set is pretty cool so I bet you the

176
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:56,530
action in that series is pretty well done. Yeah,
both of these characters are pretty powerful so

177
00:17:56,530 --> 00:18:01,930
I'm excited to see how this is going to turn out. To
explain the methodology behind our duels, let's

178
00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:08,330
go to our sentient duel simulator, Alfred Jarvis
9000. AJ and NK tell our listeners how you go about

179
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:14,470
determining a winner in our duel matchups. Yes, of
course, sir. The way I determine a winner between

180
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:20,090
the contestants is by running 1000 Monte Carlo
simulations using the characters statistics. A

181
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:24,390
Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic model
used to determine outcomes through random

182
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:29,870
sampling. In this case, I randomize the
statistics along a normal distribution as a way to

183
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:34,550
simulate the many variables that can occur during
battle. The stat parameters are based on the

184
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:39,610
official Marvel power grid from which the DC
characters statistics are extrapolated.

185
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:44,610
Additional stat categories are included such as
range, damage potential, versatility and

186
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:50,070
perception in order to create a more detailed and
accurate simulation. The results of the 1000

187
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:54,630
simulations provide a percentage of wins for each
character. The contestant with the higher

188
00:18:54,630 --> 00:19:00,150
percentage is declared the victor as they have a
higher probability to win any given battle. In an

189
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:05,570
equitable pairing, neither character should win
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have

190
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:10,450
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat
Superman, so the confidence rate of my method

191
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:14,490
falls in line with the precedents that have been
established in the source material. My

192
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:18,970
mathematical simulations are without
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole

193
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:25,350
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ and IK.

194
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:28,710
Before we run the simulations, though, we'd like
to break down each character's histories and

195
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:33,870
abilities before improvising a scenario on how we
imagine one of the 1000 simulations would play out

196
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:38,570
beat for beat. And I think it's my turn to go first
with the Marvel character, so let me tell you guys

197
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:44,890
all about Havoc. Alexander Summers was born in
Honolulu, Hawaii, one of the sons of Air Force

198
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:49,450
Major Christopher Summers and his wife,
Catherine. As a child living in Anchorage,

199
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:53,870
Alaska, Alex was aboard his father's private
plane with his parents and older brother Scott

200
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:59,230
when it was attacked by an alien spaceship
belonging to the Shi'ar Empire. To save their

201
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:04,490
sons, Christopher and Catherine strapped Alex
and Scott to the plane's only parachute and pushed

202
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:09,790
them out before the plane exploded. The fall left
Scott with a head injury and the boys were placed in

203
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:15,230
an orphanage in Omaha, Nebraska. Unbeknownst to
them, the facility was secretly run by the

204
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:20,090
geneticist, Mr. Sinister, who was obsessed with
the Summers bloodline. You can learn more about

205
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:25,370
Scott Summers, aka Cyclops, in his duel against
Negative Man, and more about Mr. Sinister in his

206
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:30,910
duel against the Ultra Humanite. Alex was soon
adopted by the Blandings, a couple who had lost

207
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:37,150
their own son, Todd. Traumatized in wanting a
replacement child, they raised Alex to behave

208
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:43,010
like Todd. When Todd's killer returned and
kidnapped Alex and his younger foster sister, the

209
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:49,030
stress triggered Alex's mutant powers. He
released a blast of plasma that incinerated the

210
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:54,630
kidnapper. Mr. Sinister erased Alex's memories
of the incident and suppressed his abilities,

211
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:59,730
causing Alex to grow up unaware of his mutant
nature or that he had a brother. After earning a

212
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:05,530
degree in geophysics in college, Alex was
kidnapped by Professor Ahmed Abdaal, also known

213
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:09,990
as the Living Pharaoh, who discovered that he and
Alex shared the same type of cosmic

214
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:15,670
energy-absorbing mutation. Alex's presence
prevented Abdaal from accessing his full power.

215
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:20,810
By abducting and shielding Alex from ambient
cosmic energy, Abdaal was able to transform into a

216
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:26,090
giant entity called the Living Monolith. The
X-Men arrived to stop him, and Alex's powers

217
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:30,910
reawakened under stress. Though he couldn't
control his abilities, he helped defeat the

218
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:36,690
monolith. And afterward, Professor X revealed
that Cyclops was Alex's older brother. Fearing

219
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:41,790
the damage his powers might cause, Alex initially
chose to stay behind in Egypt, but he was soon

220
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:47,570
captured by the mutant hunting sentinels led by
Larry Trask. Trask provided Alex with a

221
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:52,650
containment suit and dubbed him Havoc. The suit
helped regulate Alex's absorption and release of

222
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:57,490
cosmic radiation, which his body naturally
stored and expel in the form of powerful plasma

223
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:02,610
blasts. After being rescued by the X-Men, Alex
joined their ranks and trained to master his

224
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:07,590
abilities. You can learn more about the team in
their duel against the Titans. During this

225
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:13,270
period, Alex grew close to fellow mutant Lorna
Dane, also known as Polaris, who was the daughter

226
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:18,350
of Magneto. The two became romantically involved
and helped the X-Men repel numerous threats,

227
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:23,850
including alien invaders and anti-mutant
groups. Eventually, they left the X-Men to attend

228
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:28,830
graduate school in Nevada. However, they were
manipulated by the Shiar agent Eric the Red and

229
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:33,010
temporarily turned against the X-Men. After
being freed from their mind control, they

230
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:38,170
recovered at Muir Island, where they later fought
the reality-warping mutant Proteus. Alex

231
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:43,230
eventually learned that his and Scott's father
had survived their plane attack and escaped Shiar

232
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:49,530
slavery to become Corsair, the leader of a
spacefaring team called the Starjammers. During

233
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:55,810
their reunion, Scott met Madeline Pryor, a secret
clone of Jean Grey, at a time when he believed Jean

234
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:01,170
was dead. Alex served as the best man at Scott's
wedding to Madeline, and Alex later attempted to

235
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:06,630
leave behind the superhero life. He was drawn back
in, however, when Polaris was possessed by the

236
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:11,430
villain Malice. Alex was unable to free her from
that control and the experience left him

237
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:15,990
frustrated and helpless. He continued to serve
with the X-Men and eventually entered into a

238
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:20,830
relationship with Madeline, who had at the time
been abandoned by Scott when he learned that Jean

239
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,790
was still alive. Madeline was then corrupted by
demonic forces and transformed into the Goblin

240
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:31,670
Queen, triggering a demonic invasion of New York.
She manipulated Alex into becoming her Goblin

241
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:36,610
Prince, turning him against the X-Men, until the
conflict ended with her death, when Madeline

242
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:41,490
learned that she was a clone. You can learn more
about Jean Grey in our Raven vs Phoenix duel

243
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:47,070
episode. To escape an ambush with the cybernetic
villains known as the Reavers, Alex and the rest of

244
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:52,230
the X-Men passed through a mystical gateway
called the Siege Paralysis, which for a time left

245
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:57,470
the world thinking that the X-Men were dead. They
eventually reemerged on Earth, where Alex became

246
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:03,390
a magistrate for the new mutant nation of Genosha.
There, he helped build the Republic, led by

247
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:09,010
Magneto, into a sanctuary for mutants around the
world. Professor X later recruited Alex to lead a

248
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:14,850
government sponsored mutant team called X
Factor, where he was reunited with Polaris.

249
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:19,910
Though effective as a leader, Alex struggled with
team politics, romantic entanglements, and the

250
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:25,350
apparent death of his teammate multiple man from
the Legacy Virus. During a mission with X Factor,

251
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:30,190
Alex was presumed dead in a time machine
explosion. In reality, he was thrown into a

252
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:36,230
parallel universe known as the Mutant X Reality,
where he led a team called the Six, and was married

253
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:41,290
to Madeline Pryor with whom he had a son named
Scotty. Alex helped save the dimension from

254
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:46,110
another iteration of the Goblin Queen before
being cast into the void between dimensions,

255
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,870
where his consciousness remained suspended
until his eventual return to the main Marvel

256
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:56,110
timeline, Earth 616. He woke up in his home
reality, after which Polaris proposed marriage

257
00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:00,890
to him. Though Alex initially agreed, unsure of
his feelings, he ultimately called off the

258
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:07,070
wedding. Angered, Polaris attacked Alex, but the
two eventually reconciled. Alex rejoined the

259
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:11,370
X-Men during a time when most of the Earth's
mutants had their powers taken away by the Scarlet

260
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:17,550
Witch. Though Alex kept his powers, Polaris did
not, and they left the team to be together.

261
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:22,150
However, Polaris was later abducted by the
ancient mutant Apocalypse, who re-granted her

262
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:27,330
powers as one of his horsemen, and Alex fought
alongside the X-Men to rescue her. You can learn

263
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:32,910
more about Scarlet Witch and Apocalypse in their
respective duels against Satana and Black Adam.

264
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:38,330
Professor X soon recruited Alex for a space
mission to stop Vulcan, the long-lost Third

265
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:44,690
Summer's brother who had become a powerful threat
that usurped the alien Xiar Empire. Vulcan killed

266
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:49,750
their father Corsair, and Alex vowed revenge,
taking command of the space-faring Starjammers

267
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:55,670
to resist Vulcan's tyrannical rule. In one of
their fights, Vulcan blasted Havok into a son,

268
00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:01,490
seemingly killing him. However, Alex's ability
to absorb cosmic radiation supercharged his

269
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:07,330
cells with a massive influx of energy that enabled
him to survive the experience. Alex re-emerged

270
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:13,150
with enough power to damage Vulcan's weapons and
free his captured teammates. Returning to Earth,

271
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:18,830
Alex joined X-Factor Investigations, a mutant
private detective agency led by a multiple man who

272
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:24,150
had survived the Legacy Virus. During the
Avengers vs X-Men conflict, Alex sided with the

273
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:29,990
Avengers and was chosen by Captain America to lead
the Avengers Unity Division, an initiative meant

274
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:35,130
to promote human and mutant superhero
cooperation. During a battle with Red Onslaught,

275
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:40,730
Alex was among several heroes who were morally
inverted by a magical spell. Most were eventually

276
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:46,650
restored by a subsequent spell, but Alex remained
inverted. He resigned from the Avengers and

277
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:52,410
joined Emmafrost, Bastion, and Mr. Sinister in a
plan to spread a mutagenic virus called

278
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:58,330
Mothervine, which would cause mutations in
humans and result in mutant dominance on Earth.

279
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:02,930
However, when it was revealed that Mothervine
would also mind control all mutants, Emmafrost

280
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:08,050
betrayed the group and psychically restored
Alex's original personality. You can learn more

281
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:13,730
about Emmafrost in our Poison Ivy vs White Queen
duel episode. Alex died again while defending the

282
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:19,430
X-Men from Sentinels, but was resurrected on the
new Mutant Island nation of Krakowa through a

283
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:24,930
process they could bring mutants back to life via a
select combination of mutant powers. There, he

284
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:31,230
joined the Helians, a new team led by Silak, where a
variant of Madeline Pryor was killed on a mission.

285
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:37,070
Alex pleaded for her resurrection, but was denied
because she was a clone. Frustrated, he lashed out

286
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:41,770
and destroyed one of Mr. Sinister's hidden labs on
Krakowa, ending the villain's secret

287
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:46,470
experiments. Emmafrost eventually persuaded
the Krakowin Council to approve Madeline's

288
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:52,090
resurrection. Although she and Alex reunited,
she told him they needed space. When Alex

289
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:57,210
sacrificed himself to defend her in a later
adventure, Madeline used her magic to restore him

290
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:02,750
to life in gratitude. And that's his backstory.
Powers-wise, Havoc has the innate mutant ability

291
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:09,490
to absorb ambient cosmic energies, including
radiation, light, heat, x-rays, etc., which his

292
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:15,870
body can store and release by converting it into
plasma, which is a super hot ionized gas that

293
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:22,370
ranges from 11,000 to 14,500 degrees Fahrenheit.
Typically, the plasma emanates from Havoc in all

294
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:28,010
directions, but by focusing, he can direct the
blasts into directional beams, often while

295
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:33,150
wearing a special containment suit. He can focus
the amount of energy he projects from levels small

296
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:37,870
enough to increase the surrounding temperature
or powerful enough to disintegrate his immediate

297
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:43,670
vicinity. In addition to his mutant power, he
holds a degree in geophysical science and has

298
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:49,770
received some hand-to-hand combat training. And
that is Havoc. Wait, so he could absorb light?

299
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:54,850
Yeah, basically, in small quantities. Oh, small
quantities. Good. Cause he's gonna get so many

300
00:28:54,850 --> 00:29:00,310
quantities. Well, don't forget that he was thrown
into a sun and managed to survive that, so you might

301
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:07,290
have your work cut out for you. Hmm, we'll see. Let
me get into the Rey's backstory. Langford, happy,

302
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:12,650
Tarrell, was a reporter in the early 1940s who
joined an upper-atmosphere balloon expedition

303
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:19,510
sponsored by the U.S. government under the guise
of scientific exploration. Unbeknownst to him,

304
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:25,210
the expedition was a covert experiment by a
government research group called RONAL, or

305
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:31,630
Research on the Nature of Light, led by Dr. Dazel.
Dazel believed that light originating from the

306
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:37,290
birth of the universe would eventually circle
back to Earth as a sentient destructive entity.

307
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:42,750
And that only being composed of both human and
light could communicate with it. During the

308
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:48,550
expedition, Hapi was exposed to a burst of
electrical energy and ambient sunlight from a

309
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:54,030
detonated light bomb designed to give him
energy-based powers. Surviving the

310
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:59,570
quote-unquote accident, Hapi discovered he
could manipulate light and energy, which he used

311
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:05,870
to become the hero known as the Rey. He fought in
World War II and joined the freedom fighters to

312
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:11,190
combat access forces. During his early
adventures, he battled threats ranging from

313
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:16,930
mystics to metahumans and developed his skills as
a light-wielding champion. He later fought

314
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:23,190
alongside other Golden Age heroes in the All-Star
Squadron. After the war, Hapi married his first

315
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:29,030
wife, Gale, and had a son named Joshua. Joshua
accompanied him briefly as his sidekick

316
00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:35,410
Spitfire, until the boy's unstable nature led to a
violent episode in which he accidentally killed

317
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:40,790
his mother. Unable to cope with his son's
volatility, Hapi placed Joshua in suspended

318
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:47,710
animation. Disillusioned and burdened by the
consequences of his role in Dazel's plan, Hapi

319
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:54,950
retired as the Rey in 1950. In the 1970s, Hapi
briefly joined the freedom fighters before

320
00:30:54,950 --> 00:31:02,210
marrying again. When his second wife Nadine gave
birth to a glowing infant, Hapi realized Dazel's

321
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:07,510
theories had been correct. Bearing the
implications of raising such a child, he told

322
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:14,090
Nadine the baby had died and entrusted his son to
his brother Thomas to raise as his own. The boy was

323
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:20,190
named Raymond Terrell. Years later, Hapi was
summoned by the freedom fighters leader Uncle Sam

324
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:26,510
to seek out the mystical being known as Neon the
Unknown, who Uncle Sam believed could help Hapi's

325
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:31,990
son Raymond. You can learn more about Uncle Sam and
his duel against Captain Britain. When Neon

326
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:39,090
refused to help, Hapi drank from the mystic waters
of Neon's oasis, an act that caused him to merge

327
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:46,250
with Neon. Though Hapi as the new Neon was largely
absent after that transformation, he continued

328
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:52,750
to watch over his son from a distance. As Rey was
raised by his Uncle Thomas, it was claimed that Rey

329
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:59,270
suffered from a lethal light allergy. Confined to
a darkened home and kept from the outside world,

330
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:06,190
Rey was known to the public as Night Boy. On the day
of Thomas's death, Rey learned the truth. He was

331
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:12,510
not allergic to light, and his real father was the
wartime hero known as the Rey. At Thomas's

332
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:17,770
funeral, Rey met his cousin Hank, who helped him
step into the sunlight for the first time,

333
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:22,590
awakening his powers. Though initially
reluctant to become a hero, Rey was soon

334
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:29,550
confronted by Hapi, who revealed the truth about
Ronal and Dazel's experiments. To prepare his son

335
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:36,050
for a potential confrontation with the returning
light entity, Hapi orchestrated a complex plan,

336
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:41,930
using agents to pressure Rey into heroism.
Ultimately, Rey ventured into the realm of the

337
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:48,050
light entity and convinced it to spare Earth.
Embracing his destiny, Rey adopted the mantle of

338
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:54,390
the Rey and began his career as a superhero. He
battled villains such as Dr. Polaris, Brimstone,

339
00:32:54,390 --> 00:33:00,110
and Lobo, and briefly worked under Vandal
Savage's employ before breaking away. Following

340
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:05,350
the death of Superman, Rey was recruited into the
Justice League of America, where he served for

341
00:33:05,350 --> 00:33:10,730
about a year. During this time, he had a
short-lived romance with Black Canary, who you

342
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:15,590
can learn more about in her duel episode against
Black Widow. He later joined the Justice League

343
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:21,950
task force under the Martian Manhunter, helping
to train younger heroes. Following the team's

344
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:27,650
dissolution, Rey remained a reserve Justice
League and joined the forgotten heroes to take

345
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:33,530
down Vandal Savage. He later joined Young
Justice, where he briefly ran for team leader.

346
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:38,830
Though older than most members, he bonded with the
group before later departing. You can learn more

347
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:44,290
about Young Justice in the team duel episode
between them and the Young Avengers. Rey was

348
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:50,270
captured during a battle against the Nowhere Men,
who sought to erase individuality. He was rescued

349
00:33:50,270 --> 00:33:55,250
during the fight and returned to his hero duties,
joining a new incarnation of the Freedom

350
00:33:55,250 --> 00:34:01,090
Fighters. During an ambush by the Secret Society,
most of the team was killed, and Rey was taken

351
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:06,750
hostage to power a device meant to recreate the
universe. He was freed, however, before its

352
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:12,730
destruction. He reemerged with a new costume and
defeated the rogue Stan Silver, who had stolen his

353
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:18,489
identity. Rey joined the Reformed Freedom
Fighters and helped counter various threats.

354
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:24,530
During the sun-eating crisis, Rey masqueraded as
a second son to deceive the threat and provide

355
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:29,270
hope. He continued aiding the superhero
community, including participating in

356
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:35,150
operations against the Anti-Life equation. In
post-Flashpoint continuity, Raymond Terrell

357
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:40,670
was raised in a windowless home by his mother
Nadine, who claimed he was deathly allergic to

358
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:46,270
light. In truth, Rey's powers were latent and
dangerous, passed down from his father, the

359
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:52,330
original Rey. After an accidental flare-up of his
abilities injured his childhood friend, Caden

360
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:58,990
Zipodi, Rey became completely isolated. On his
18th birthday, Rey left his home and was struck by

361
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:04,830
the lights of the city, triggering his
transformation into a being of living light. He

362
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:11,490
became invisible and remained in that state for
four years, drifting through the world. One day,

363
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:17,030
he saw Caden campaigning for mayor of Vanity,
Oregon, and watched an attempt on his life by a

364
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:22,990
member of the Sons of Liberty. Rey intervened
using his powers to stop the attack and was dubbed

365
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:28,910
the Rey by the press. He became the city's
protector and was later recruited into Batman's

366
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:35,110
new Justice League of America. With the league,
Rey participated in freeing the hero Bloodwind,

367
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:41,250
resisting reality-altering threats and serving
as a courier during dimensional crises. He helped

368
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:47,430
expose plots by the Secret Society, contributed
to relief efforts after global disasters, and

369
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:54,190
operated as a solo hero when not engaged with the
league. And that's the Rey's backstory so far.

370
00:35:54,190 --> 00:36:00,910
Powers-wise, the Rey possesses the ability to
absorb and process light energy, which fuels his

371
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:05,870
superhuman abilities. He can project
concentrated rays of destructive light, emit

372
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:11,730
blinding flashes, and form solid light
constructs similar to those of a Green Lantern.

373
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:17,010
His powers allow him to create illusions, render
himself invisible, and heal from injuries

374
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:23,730
through photonic regeneration. Rey can also
convert his entire body into coherent light,

375
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:29,010
rendering himself intangible and immune to
physical damage, while also allowing him to

376
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:37,090
travel at light speed. And that's the Rey. That's a
bullshit power set. Any more so than Havoc's?

377
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:42,250
What? Yeah, he could turn into light and move at the
speed of light. What is he, the Flash? All I know is

378
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:49,750
that it's just like DC to name a character whose
superhero name is the Rey as Rey. His real name is

379
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:55,150
Rey. What the fuck? All right, it makes things
easy. Way to go, DC. It's not like anyone's going to

380
00:36:55,150 --> 00:37:00,950
deduce his secret identity. When he goes into his
like power mode, he turns actually all black, kind

381
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:06,750
of similar to Sunspot. Oh, from absorbing all the
ambient light energy? Exactly. Yeah, actually,

382
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:13,050
his design was created by Joe Cassata, the former
editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics. Oh,

383
00:37:13,050 --> 00:38:09,830
interesting. That is interesting. But now that
we've got their history as a whole, we're going to

384
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:15,130
have to go back to the way. Let's speculate on how
one of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The

385
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:19,390
winner is determined by simulations, not the
speculation, but it's fun to imagine how the fight

386
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:25,270
could play out. AG9K, what are the rules of our
speculation? Well, I should say there are no rules

387
00:38:25,270 --> 00:38:30,110
other than the characters have no prior knowledge
of the other going into the fight. All they are

388
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:35,170
aware of starting out is that the other character
is a threat that needs to be eliminated. For the

389
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:40,150
speculation, the contestants will begin
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript

390
00:38:40,150 --> 00:38:45,210
environment that will have no bearing on the match
itself, as no environmental statistics are

391
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:50,370
considered in my simulations. The contestants
must earn victory on their own merit. All right

392
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:56,690
then, let's get into it. Rey and Havoc meet on the
battlefield. Who goes first? Actually, I'm going

393
00:38:56,690 --> 00:39:02,550
to say the Rey goes first because he can move at
light speed since he's literally light and he'll

394
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:08,690
start off by emitting these flashes of bright
light from his palms that are going to blind Havoc

395
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:14,090
and while Havoc is stumbling around, not sure
where to aim, that's when Rey's gonna just

396
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:20,870
straight up blast him right through his heart with
the laser beam. Boom. But who needs to aim when you

397
00:39:20,870 --> 00:39:27,890
can blast in all directions at any given time?
Like, Havoc doesn't need to aim, so like, sure, he

398
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:33,410
may get temporarily blinded but as his eyes are
recovering and before the Rey could even laser

399
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:40,050
him, Havoc's just gonna release a plasma wave in
all directions and that wave is gonna plow into the

400
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:46,630
Rey and it's gonna throw off his laser beam while
also incinerating him with 12,000 degree heat.

401
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:54,270
No, because as the Rey gets blasted by the initial
front of the wave of plasma, he's going to turn his

402
00:39:54,270 --> 00:40:01,370
body intangible and that's going to allow that
wave to pass right through him before the Rey traps

403
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:07,530
Havoc in a sphere of hard light and then just slam
him into the ground repeatedly, knocking him

404
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:13,170
silly and probably knocking Havoc out. Wait,
wait, wait, I don't think the Rey can phase through

405
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:18,770
plasma. Like, it's not some kind of like solid
physical attack that's just gonna go through him.

406
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:24,430
That's like saying Rey's gonna phase through the
air that's around him. Like, the Rey would somehow

407
00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:29,390
have to physically remove himself from like their
plane of existence or something to not be affected

408
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:37,010
by the superheated matter around him. Well, yeah,
plasma is matter. Rey can phase through matter.

409
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:42,510
Yeah, but it's like highly energized matter.
Like, it's atoms that become ions, essentially.

410
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:48,450
So how can the Rey phase through something that's
affecting his surrounding physical location?

411
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:54,570
Like, if he were placed in a giant oven and the oven
was turned up to 12,000 degrees, do you think the

412
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:59,810
Rey could just phase through the heated air around
him in order to avoid being baked? Because I don't

413
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:07,430
think so. That's a good question. You know, he
could always phase through the oven wall, but if

414
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:13,650
it's too big for him to reach it in time, he probably
would be damaged because he is vulnerable to

415
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:21,290
energy attacks like heat. There you go. Exactly.
So going back, no, Rey isn't creating any sort of

416
00:41:21,290 --> 00:41:27,210
hard light construct. He's fucking baking in his
helmet. Okay, well, all right, so the blast would

417
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:35,170
probably knock him out of his light mode, but once
he reentered it as a being composed of pure light,

418
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:40,950
he'd be fully healed once again. So that's when
he's going to trap Havok in that sphere and knock

419
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:47,070
him around. So he has like some kind of like light
based healing factor? Yeah, exactly. He's a being

420
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:53,370
of pure light. He doesn't have like a physical form
per se, sort of. Like he was once shot in the back of

421
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:58,150
the head and was told that he was going to be like
paralyzed for the rest of his life, but then he just

422
00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:04,730
switched in and out of his light mode and he was
fully healed. That's stupid. So you say that he

423
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:10,670
traps Havok in a solid light construct? I don't
even know what solid light is, like even

424
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:16,530
conceptually, like what is it made out of? Like is
this like maybe a photon's head mass? Whatever.

425
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:20,610
I'm going to say that Havok is going to be able to
blast through it with a focused plasma beam from

426
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:25,970
his chest and it's going to go through the hard
light construct and slam into Rey again since

427
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:30,950
we've established that yeah, Rey is going to be
vulnerable to plasma and getting hit is going to

428
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:35,710
make him drop the construct. Okay. So the hard
light sphere disappears, Havok lands on his feet

429
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:41,410
under the ground and then he's going to blast a
plasma beam downward to propel himself up into the

430
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:48,970
air and just punch Rey right in his tangible face.
Oh, sorry. When Havok was knocked around, you

431
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:54,950
know, he lost his bearings and he didn't notice
that the Rey he now sees is actually a projected

432
00:42:54,950 --> 00:43:02,570
illusion from the now invisible Rey who's
actually behind Havok and he's going to fly into

433
00:43:02,570 --> 00:43:09,530
Havok at high speed and you just send him skidding
across the ground. Okay. Yeah, that would

434
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:15,110
probably hurt Havok, you know, getting hit at high
speed would definitely mean that he's going to get

435
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:20,790
up pretty slowly from the ground. But as the Rey
flies in and tries to land a finishing blow, all of a

436
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:25,570
sudden he just collapses out of the air like he's
sick or something because as it turns out this

437
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:31,090
entire match, Havok has been releasing like a low
level of plasma throughout the environment

438
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:36,950
that's been slowly burning and charring the Rey's
body from the inside out like a microwave. And

439
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:41,010
since we've established that intangibility
isn't going to help the Rey here, his insides are

440
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:47,710
basically charred like an overcooked steak and he
falls to the ground dead. Okay. The problem I have

441
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:56,230
is your use of the word slow. Like Havok stands up
slowly, he's slowly been burning the Rey. The Rey

442
00:43:56,230 --> 00:44:03,910
is not slow. Okay. Even if he's damaged on the
inside and maybe even is dying in less than a

443
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:10,770
second, Rey could just slam into Havok, fly him
into outer space at light speed and just cause

444
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:16,630
Havok to freeze out there among the stars. No, no,
no. Havok isn't freezing at any point. He could

445
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:22,970
just keep himself warm with low level plasma and
but can he breathe? No, but he's displayed the

446
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:28,290
ability to survive for a short time in space like
when he absorbed the power of a star in his fight

447
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:34,570
with Vulcan. And this whole match he's been
absorbing basically the power of a star by the

448
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:40,550
energy that the Rey gives off. So, you know, Havok,
he's amped up. He's doing just fine. He's going to

449
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:47,070
direct a blast of plasma that sends him hurling
like a plasma comet that slams right into Rey and

450
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:51,850
sends them both creaning back into Earth, back
through the atmosphere, the heat upon reentry.

451
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:56,910
That's not going to matter, but they crash into the
ground and the Rey just flattens on impact. And

452
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:03,150
Havok, yeah, he's probably going to flatten too,
but the Rey is going to flatten first and therefore

453
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:10,650
Havok wins. Okay, well, I say the Rey is just going
to phase through Havok at the last second and let

454
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:17,570
Havok crash his own damn self into the planet's
surface, just kind of causing himself. So, Rey

455
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:24,130
survives, Havok doesn't match over. No, I think
the Rey's body is too charred on the inside by this

456
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:29,550
point to be able to do any sort of phasing. So, Havok
actually wins. But we'll go ahead and leave the

457
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:33,690
match there. It's kind of an interesting way to end
this fight, but that's where we ended up. Let's go

458
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:38,070
ahead and input the stats for the characters, run
the simulations, and find out which scenario

459
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:44,870
happens when we come back. A.J .9K, hit it!
Inputting data, running calculations,

460
00:45:44,870 --> 00:45:51,370
processing results, simulations complete. All
right, these guys are two definite powerhouses

461
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:56,830
when it came to damage potential. They could both
basically explode and destroy entire city blocks

462
00:45:56,830 --> 00:46:01,410
with their energy. Although we did say Havok was a
little bit more powerful in terms of damage

463
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:06,510
potential just because he can do things like melt
adamantium, whereas we didn't think the Rey would

464
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:12,790
be able to do that. No, yeah, Havok got the leg up
when it came to damage, but the Rey was pretty off

465
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:18,210
the charts in other stat categories, such as
movement speed, evasiveness because of his

466
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:24,290
intangibility, and even durability thanks to his
healing ability. Yeah, we also said that the Rey

467
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:30,690
was more versatile considering he can do all sorts
of things with his energy-based powers. However,

468
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:36,550
Havok is smarter having a degree in geophysical
science, so he's got that going for him. And I think

469
00:46:36,550 --> 00:46:41,190
that his advantage and intellect and damage
potential are enough to give him the win here. What

470
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:48,010
do you think, Jonathan? I disagree. I think the Rey
is going to take this match handedly, although our

471
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:55,570
followers on Instagram disagree with me. In the
poll that we put up, 57% of people cited with Havok.

472
00:46:55,570 --> 00:47:02,210
Damn straight. Various two group of Instagram
followers that we have, for sure. I doubt it.

473
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:07,070
They're going to learn today. Don't knock our
followers, but let's see who won. AJ and IK, the

474
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:20,490
results, please. Hey, you are, sir. All right, the
winner between the Rey and Havok is the Rey. Yes!

475
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:25,690
Now, did I say his superhero name or his real name?
Who knows? Because D.C.'s dumb. Yes, the answer is

476
00:47:25,690 --> 00:47:35,790
yes. At a 1000 simulated matches, Rey won a
whopping 891 battles, whereas Havok only won 109.

477
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:44,110
So, Rey had a win rate of 89.1%, whereas Havok only
had 10.9%. So you're telling me Rey beats Havok 9

478
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:52,350
out of 10 times? Only because Rey is a cheater
character who can do way too much and, uh, sucks?

479
00:47:52,350 --> 00:48:01,410
Yeah. I'll be honest, I did not think that the Rey
was going to defeat Havok so handedly. I actually

480
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:07,790
thought Havok was going to be a good opponent for
Rey, but clearly we were all wrong. Yeah, it's a

481
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:12,350
mismatch. It's a mismatch for sure. We never
should have put Havok up against Rey. We probably

482
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:17,170
should have put Havok up against, like, Robin or
somebody. I don't know. I think that would have

483
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:22,370
been a better matchup. So I'm going to say this one
doesn't even count, right? Oh no, I'm sorry. It

484
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:28,610
actually does count. Sucks to suck. I'm just going
to forget this one as soon as this episode ends,

485
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:33,630
which is right now. It's just going to be a bad
dream, basically. It's your living nightmare,

486
00:48:33,630 --> 00:49:10,070
motherfucker. So that does it for this duel, guys.
A.J. and I.K. help close this out. Our next episode

487
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:15,410
is going to be another duel episode, where we find
out who would win in a fight between Mary Marble and

488
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:19,270
Hercules. But that does it for this episode. We
want to give a big thanks to our executive
