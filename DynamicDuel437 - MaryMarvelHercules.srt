00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,760
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi and welcome
to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,479
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:37,920
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe and I'm his twin

4
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,740
brother Johnny DC. And in this episode we're going
to find out who would win in a fight between the

5
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:50,120
Greek God-powered characters of Mary Marvel and
Hercules. You know, Hercules is not Greek

6
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,620
God-powered, he is the Greek God of Strength in
Marvel. Oh interesting, I didn't realize he was

7
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:02,620
promoted above Demi-God. Yeah, that is correct. I
do have to say though that even with his godhood, I

8
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:08,980
think this is a mismatch, probably as big of a one
that was Rey vs. Havoc. Because Mary Marvel has all

9
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:15,580
of the powers and Hercules is just some strong
dude. So... Isn't it going to be funny when

10
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:19,820
Hercules beats the shit out of Mary Marvel and then
you're going to be like, oh I was so stupid for

11
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,820
thinking this is a mismatch? No, I don't think
that'll be funny. It'll be funny when Hercules

12
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,880
wins. But before we get into that duel matchup
guys, where we input their stats and run

13
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,060
simulations to see who would win in a fight, we're
going to break down the latest comic book movie

14
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,440
news this past week, of which there was quite a bit
because a lot of studios had their upfront

15
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:42,100
presentations to potential advertisers. So in
addition to the Superman official trailer, which

16
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:47,580
sure, yeah that came out last week, we got the Iron
Heart official trailer last week guys, hell yeah.

17
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:54,720
We also got the teaser for the upcoming Spider-Nor
television show starring Nicholas Cage, and we

18
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,380
also learned that Kristen Ritter will be
returning as Jessica Jones in the next season of

19
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:05,260
Daredevil Born Again. A lot of great Marvel news
and some rinky-dink DC news, but excited to get

20
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:11,800
into it. You doing this just tells me how buttery
you are, how good the Superman trailer was. You

21
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,900
know it and you're hard to be true. As always guys,
we list our segment times in our episode

22
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,780
description, so feel free to check out the show
notes if you want to skip ahead to a particular

23
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:25,440
topic. Our artificially intelligent duel
simulator, AJ9K, has a quick message for our

24
00:02:25,440 --> 00:03:14,520
listeners, so listen up. Thanks AJ9K and thanks to
everyone who supports the podcast. Guys, be sure

25
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,120
to tune into the other shows on the DynaMic Podcast
Network this week, including the console combat

26
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,060
podcast where hosts John and Dean simulate
battles between popular video game characters.

27
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:28,960
In yesterday's episode, they speculated on who
would win in a fight between Joel Miller from The

28
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:34,640
Last of Us versus Leon Kennedy from Resident Evil.
That's going to be a good one. Over on the Max

29
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,400
Destruction podcast, hosts Scotty and Gilly, pit
your favorite action heroes from film and

30
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,100
television against each other. They're on a brief
season break, but they will be returning this

31
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,060
June. On the Senjoh  World podcast, host Zachary
Hepburn speculates on fights between fan

32
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,680
favorite anime and manga characters. On
Thursday, Zach is going to reveal who would win in a

33
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,540
fight between Sunraku from Shingra La Frontier
versus Kirito from Sword Art Online. He's finally

34
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,920
feeling better guys, he got the cast off, so we're
glad that he's back with us. Visit

Quick to the No Prize! A No Prize is an award that

37
00:04:17,779 --> 00:04:23,540
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version, the
Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award that we

38
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:29,240
post on Instagram for the person that we feel gave
the best answer to our question of the week. Last

39
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:35,680
week we asked you guys, cast any Saturday Night
Live actor as a Marvel or DC superhero, who would

40
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,500
you cast and why? And this is coming off of the news
that Tim Meadows is going to have a role in the

41
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,460
upcoming Peacemaker season 2. We got quite a
number of answers, so we're going to break down

42
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,680
this week's 3 honorable mentions before
revealing the No Prize winner. Our first

43
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,960
honorable mention goes to... by Dear Bangura and
Cyrus Moore. They both gave the same answer so

44
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:31,520
they're sharing an honorable mention. They
said... I think it'd be pretty interesting. Yeah,

45
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,660
Andy Sandberg is one of the all-time Saturday
Night Live greats in my opinion. I love the Lonely

46
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,640
Island and what they did with their digital
shorts. I think he would totally kill it as Booster

47
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:48,420
Gold. He may not have the physique to play a
superhero, but I don't think you really need that

48
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:53,320
when you're playing a comedic character like
Booster Gold who has this high-tech weaponry. It

49
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,520
could work. It could totally work. And you know
what? Have your Metacony play Ted Corden, Blue

50
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,520
Beetle. I could see that working. I could also see
Jason Sudeikis in the role of Ted Corden, Blue

51
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,660
Beetle, since he's been a fancast as that
character for a while. But you know, both Jason

52
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,620
Sudeikis and Andy Sandberg were on SNL at the same
time. You're talking about Andy Sandberg's

53
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:17,400
physique, but he actually had a pretty good
physique in the movie Popstar and in Brooklyn

54
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,000
Nine-Nine. I think Brooklyn Nine-Nine was a great
show. He really proved himself as a leading man for

55
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,860
a sitcom series like that. And since we know that
Booster Gold is going to be a TV show set in the DCU, I

56
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,840
think Andy Sandberg could totally carry that.
He'd be fantastic. Great answer by Dyr and Cyrus.

57
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,680
Our next honorable mention goes to Travis
Herndon. Who said? What's our dynamic news?

58
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:44,320
Travis here. Shout out to Manevele Twin. So my
answer would be Kenan Thompson as Night Thrasher.

59
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:50,580
I think he would be an interesting character for
him to play, especially if you go to comedic route

60
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,640
with him. Kind of like making him Marvel's
equivalent of kickass or vigilante from

61
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,040
Peacemaker. I think Kenan Thompson could pull it
off and you know, you can maybe have him like a

62
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:06,480
season two of She-Hulk or something as like this
goofy vigilante or something being sued. I love

63
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:11,480
this idea. At first I wasn't quite sold on the idea
of Kenan Thompson playing a superhero when I was

64
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,080
first listening to Travis's answer. But then when
he pitched the idea of making it kind of like

65
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,340
kickass or vigilante from Peacemaker, I was
instantly sold. I was like, that's exactly how

66
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,640
Kenan should approach this character of Night
Thrasher, who of course is one of the founding

67
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:32,420
members of the new Warriors team for Marvel. Yeah,
I don't know much about Night Thrasher. Does he

68
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:37,560
have any powers? No, he's like a master martial
artist. He's a street vigilante in the true sense.

69
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,980
Okay, yeah, that sounds perfect then. Night
Thrasher will be a member of your team in our

70
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:48,600
upcoming Infinity, Inc. vs. New Warriors team
duel episode, which spoiler alert is going to be

71
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,580
our next episode. So look forward to that. Great
answer, Travis. Our final honorable mention goes

72
00:07:53,580 --> 00:08:00,540
to Mike Williams. Who said? Hi guys, Mike Williams
here. I don't necessarily see anyone I would cast

73
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:09,660
as a hero, but I see David Spade. I think he would
make a decent arcade. The villain out of Marvel

74
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:16,740
who's always taunting the X-Men and Spider-Man.
Well, that's my take. As always, make mine Marvel.

75
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,180
Thanks. We got a lot of great answers for this
particular no prize, but this is one of the only

76
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,140
answers where as soon as I heard it, I really
couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. If

77
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:32,760
Arcade ever makes live action appearance in the
MCU as a villain for the X-Men or maybe like in a

78
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,760
special presentation since I couldn't see him
really holding his own film as a villain, they

79
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:42,100
would have to cast David Spade in my opinion,
because he would be so perfect for that. Yeah, when

80
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:48,820
I think of Arcade, he definitely has the voice at
the very least of David Spade. Yeah, I guess if they

81
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:53,020
went in animated route, but I think he also has the
look minus the red hair. They would just have to dye

82
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:58,320
David Spade's hair red. But speaking of a lot of
great answers, we want to give a huge shout out to a

83
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,560
bunch of people who called in this past week. You
guys came out of the woodwork and we truly

84
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:07,480
appreciate it. So shout out to Brian Rochester,
who said that Chris Catan should play Slapstick. I

85
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,440
don't know if the MCU is ready for a character like
Slapstick just yet, but Chris Catan could totally

86
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,460
do the voice for the character because I think
you'd have to go animated for that. Carter Pitts

87
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:22,380
said Andy Sandbrook should play Trickster, the
Flash villain. Colby Hinches cast a new gods film

88
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:28,560
with people like Mikey Day as Mr. Miracle and Billy
Crystal as Oberon. Jose Marcial said John Mulaney

89
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,700
should play Snowflame as a cocaine joke. Although
I don't think John Mulaney was ever part of the cast

90
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:39,680
officially. He was just a writer at SNL. Cat
Stevenson cast the Avengers with SNL characters.

91
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,560
Lorenzo Valdez said Eddie Murphy should play Gus
Gorman, who was the character that Richard Pryor

92
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,180
played in Superman 3. Travis Bailey, who gave a
shout out to his good twin Travis Herndon, said

93
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:56,840
that Damon Waynes should bring his blank man
character to either the Marvel or DC Universe. But

94
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:25,940
the winner of this week's No Prize is Paul Graves,
who said... I'm really wishing that I cut that last

95
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:32,920
part out of his message. I can't censor the truth.
Now, Martin Short has to be one of my favorite SNL

96
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:40,420
alums of all time. He and Steve Martin are one of the
greatest all time comedy duos ever. And I could

97
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:47,080
totally see Martin Short playing a character to
perfection like Mr. Misk Spitalik. Yeah, this

98
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,760
answer really stood out to me as well because once I
heard it, I really couldn't imagine anyone else in

99
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,960
the role. Now, of course, I think it was Gilbert
Gottfried who voiced the character in the

100
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:00,620
Superman cartoon series from the 90s. And he would
have been a great Mr. Misk Spitalik too. But Martin

101
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:06,120
Short, I think, has the look and the personality, I
think, to tackle a character like that. Yeah, and

102
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:11,140
despite him being older, he still has quite a bit of
physicality to him too. Oh, for sure. The guy can

103
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:16,520
move around. He's very spry. Great answer, Paul.
You win this week's No Prize. If you, the listener,

104
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,880
want to shot at winning your own No Prize, stay
tuned to later on in this episode when we'll be

105
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:32,900
asking another question of the week. But now that
that's done, on to the news. OK, so last week Warner

106
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:40,600
Brothers finally gave us the first official
trailer for Superman, James Gunn's first DCU film

107
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:46,320
that's hitting theaters in mid July. Now, we've
had a teaser trailer, which I thought was really

108
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:52,060
good and an extended version of that. But I feel
like this is the first trailer we've seen where we

109
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:58,340
finally get to see David Corn Sweat's acting
approach to the character. The trailer starts off

110
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:03,580
with Clark Kent and Lois Lane. I think in Lois'
apartment, maybe their shared apartment,

111
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:09,000
they're clearly a couple. But she gets to
interview him for the first time as Superman,

112
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,220
considering he did something fairly
controversial and that he stopped a war abroad to

113
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:22,560
help save lives. And Rachel Brosnahan, as Lois
Lane, totally kills it as a reporter. You know, she

114
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,480
definitely asks Clark the tough questions enough
for him to get fairly upset. But it's also kind of

115
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:34,020
cool just to see how much character David Corn
Sweat is going to bring to the character of Clark.

116
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:39,960
Just in contrast, it made me feel like Henry
Cavill's past performance was a little bit more

117
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:47,800
muted and maybe a little bit more generic. Like
this Superman seems much more like a real person.

118
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,820
Yeah, it was a really interesting start to the
trailer. It went places I didn't think it was going

119
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:57,840
to go, but it seems like the film is going to speak
to, you know, the larger issue of superhero ethics

120
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,640
and the role of Superman within modern society,
which is not something any of the other Superman

121
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:08,520
films have really done. Well, I think Zack Snyder
actually tried to approach ethics in his films.

122
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:12,920
But just the way this interview was set up, I feel
like it's going to be a little bit more successful

123
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,340
in having the audience ponder these questions. I
didn't really like the editorializing that Lois

124
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,820
Lane kind of did with her questions. It seemed just
a little bit antagonistic, but I guess that's kind

125
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,160
of who Lois Lane is. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. And I
mean, it looks like a lot of people are

126
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:33,680
antagonistic towards Superman in this trailer,
including the US military, including Lex Luthor,

127
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:40,020
who has sided with the engineer apparently to
invade the fortress of solitude, which I didn't

128
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:45,760
love seeing that in this trailer. I think I figured
that it was going to happen, but this is going to be

129
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,780
the third or fourth movie now where Lex Luthor has
broken into the fortress. Oh, yeah, there was

130
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:56,180
Superman 2 famously and also Superman Returns
with Kevin Spacey's version of Lex Luthor. But

131
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,880
Nicholas Holt plays a pretty damn good Lex Luthor,
I think. Yeah, just watching Kim perform, I have to

132
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,240
feel like his acting is coming from a very real
place of him just missing out on the role of

133
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:11,140
Superman because he was next in line after David
Cornswet to get the role. So he's probably like,

134
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:17,300
fucking David Cornswet. The engineer looks
interesting. She's made up entirely of like

135
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:23,060
nanobots and can transform her limbs and stuff
into deadly weapons. She kind of comes across as

136
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:28,360
like the Faiora of this movie. But we also get to see
like Miss Tess Mocker, like doing a selfie with

137
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,580
Superman fighting a monster in the background. We
get to see a lot of supporting cast, including Ma

138
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:38,820
and Pod Kent. Actually, Pod Kent, Jonathan Kent
get some voiceover in this trailer, which is kind

139
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:44,540
of cool. They're very, very like Kansas farm
couple. Like more so, I feel like than any other

140
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:48,940
depiction of them that we've seen on screen. For
sure. Yeah, I liked how human they were presented

141
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:54,300
where Ma Kent was like, I cleaned your boots. I'll
go get them. It was funny. Of course, we also get to

142
00:14:54,300 --> 00:15:01,140
see the Justice League in this trailer with Green
Lantern, Hawk Girl, Mr. Terrific. And we get to see

143
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:05,180
them display some of their powers like Green
Lantern kind of flicking some soldiers with a

144
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:10,720
giant green hand. And we also get to see
Metamorpho, who looks like is caged with Superman

145
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,980
in this like glass prison. And he's keeping him
there by turning his hand into Kryptonite, which

146
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:22,140
is pretty wild. Yeah, Metamorpho is a good guy,
though. So Lex Luthor must be manipulating him in

147
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:25,960
order to create that Kryptonite. Yeah, it kind of
looks that way. Maybe by the end of this,

148
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:31,120
Metamorpho will join the Justice League. We also
get to see Ultraman in this trailer. I think that's

149
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,720
Ultraman. People keep calling him Ultraman. I'm
still not 100 percent sure if that's the actual

150
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:43,840
Ultraman, you know, from Earth 3 or if that's like
Lex's battle suit or what it is. No idea. There's

151
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:48,680
still a lot to the story that I feel like we don't
know anything about yet. Well, speaking of battle

152
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:54,820
suits, Superman fights another guy wearing a like
juggernaut almost ask battle suit in this

153
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,560
trailer. Yeah, one that has heat vision. Yeah. Is
that Lex Luthor's battle suit? Is it someone

154
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,580
else's? No idea. But he also fights a Kaiju. I feel
like Superman is just going up against everybody

155
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:10,780
in this movie. Oh, yeah. Yeah, this movie is going
to be all over the place, I feel like, which I'm kind

156
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:16,020
of concerned about, but we'll see how James Gunn
handles it. I didn't love the way the trailer ended

157
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:21,080
with the end joke with, oh, you have a dog and then
there's crypto. It's cute, but it's also

158
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:28,120
Marvel-esque to me. Like, I don't need that kind of
end stinger joke in my DC trailers. Well, DC is just

159
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,460
trying to copy a successful formula, and that is to
say, you know, they're ripping off Marvel. Just

160
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:38,780
give me more epicness. All right. I don't need the
jokes. I need the epicness. And it looks like this

161
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:45,020
movie is going to be pretty epic. It comes out in
July 11th. Can't wait to see it. Super stoked. Way

162
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:50,000
more stoked for this than some shit show like Iron
Heart is probably going to be. Why are you dissing

163
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,360
on Iron Heart? Because they released the trailer
the same day that Warner Brothers released the

164
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,920
Superman trailer, knowing that it was going to
just get buried. Like, who does that? All I know is

165
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,480
that it looks like people are hyped for the Iron
Heart trailer, and I would consider myself one of

166
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,720
them. But let's talk about it. So the trailer
starts off really hammering home that the series

167
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,660
is executive produced by Ryan Coogler, who, of
course, directed the Black Panther films. With

168
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,940
the latter film in the series actually debuting
the character of Riri Williams, where she goes to

169
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:27,099
Wakanda and builds the Iron Heart suit of armor. Of
course, she doesn't get to take it back with her. So

170
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:33,280
this Iron Heart series, I think, is her trying to
rebuild and improve upon her designs. She goes

171
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,500
into this elevator in the trailer where it
suddenly starts filling up with gas. And we hear

172
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,760
from the hood who's played by Anthony Ramos that
this is an interview pitch to see if she can get out

173
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:50,440
of this deadly trap. The way she gets out of it is a
little strange because instead of disarming the

174
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:56,000
gas bomb and putting on the gas mask, she, I guess,
stops the elevator. Man handles one of the handles

175
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,580
off of the side of the elevator and then uses it as
leverage to pry open the elevator door, which

176
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,180
seemed a little low-tech from my perspective. You
would think that she would do something a little

177
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,960
bit more crazy, like, I don't know, turn the
elevator into a jet that shoots out of the building

178
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,500
or something. I don't know. That's just off the top
of my head. I don't know if that's a good example.

179
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:20,820
But manhandling the doors open was not that
impressive to me in terms of a tech solution. Yeah,

180
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:27,440
it literally wasn't a tech solution unless you're
going back to caveman tech. But they called her a

181
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,520
genius for her actions there. I guess she passes
her interview by performing these actions. It did

182
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:36,940
take some out-of-the-box thinking, which can
definitely be considered genius inventive

183
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:42,220
thinking. You know, she's going to MIT. We see her
working on New Iron Man armor. She says she wants to

184
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:46,860
build something iconic, which was a little bit of a
strange adjective to me because I think to be

185
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:51,480
iconic, you know, you're building something that
is a symbol, but it also implies a sort of

186
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,920
originality. But we know that the Iron Heart armor
is heavily inspired by the Iron Man armor. I

187
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:05,780
thought the same exact thing. To me, an icon is set
apart from everything else and really is a legacy

188
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:11,600
character for Iron Man. Right, yeah. She takes on
Tony Stark's legacy and I hope they address that in

189
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:17,360
this series. I think to not bring up Tony Stark at
all would be a mistake. And what was really

190
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,500
interesting is that in the comic books, Tony
Stark's consciousness depicted as an AI hologram

191
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,600
really served as a mentor for Riri as she was
building the suit of armor. They kind of became

192
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,860
like colleagues in a sense in that way, which was
really nice. I think that's what fans want and

193
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:37,300
expect from this series. And my concern is that
they're not going to address Tony Stark's legacy

194
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:42,680
at all. I mean, eventually Riri becomes her own
character, but we don't want to lose sight of that

195
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:48,260
legacy, I think. From the previous look at this
show that we got, I think last year at D23, we

196
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:54,060
learned that the series is taking on kind of like a
set it off type plot where Riri temporarily

197
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:59,020
becomes a thief in order to get the money to fund her
work, building the Iron Heart armor. Therefore,

198
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:03,820
she partners with Parker Robbins, a.k .a. the
hood. Who seems pretty cool in this trailer too? We

199
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:09,300
see that he can bend his magic bullets like he can in
the comic books. The source of his powers are magic

200
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:14,980
based in nature. He gets the hood from Mephisto and
rumors are that Mephisto will be making an

201
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:19,240
appearance in this series, which is interesting
because we'll get that magic versus technology

202
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:24,800
angle here. There was one shot that I thought was
pretty cool, if not a bit derivative, where it

203
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:30,680
looks like Riri is going to get run over by a semi
truck and the armor comes to save her. And then she

204
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,220
does like a superhero landing and punches the
truck over her. We've seen that a lot in these

205
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:40,740
superhero shows. So it wasn't that original to see
it again. I'm really hoping that they take this

206
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,540
series in a direction to make it worth the
investment that Marvel Studios has put into it.

207
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,660
Because I don't know if there's a whole lot of
demand for this series, but if it's good, then I

208
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,620
don't think people will care that there wasn't a
lot of demand. Very true. And you've mentioned the

209
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,000
investment that Marvel has put into this and it
does look like they put quite a bit of money. The

210
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,740
show looks really good, I would say. I don't mean
just the special effects, but just the

211
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,940
cinematography alone. Yeah, it's very
cinematic. The end stinger after the title card,

212
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:14,520
we see Riri go into some guy's bunker. The
character is Joe McGillicuddy, who is an original

213
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:19,120
character to this series. I don't remember that
name from the comic books. And I didn't even know

214
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,940
that Alden Ehrenreich was going to be in this show.
So it was pretty interesting that he shows up.

215
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:29,740
Yeah, I almost wonder if he's like a stand in for
Tony Stark as that kind of mentor type figure.

216
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:34,540
Maybe. He does have like guided missiles in his
bunker or something like that. So he might be some

217
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:40,660
kind of weapons designer like Tony Stark was.
We'll see. The show comes out in about a month. The

218
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:44,960
first three episodes are going to launch on June
24th on Disney Plus. And then we're going to get the

219
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,420
remaining three episodes in the weeks after that.
It is surprising that they're debuting the show

220
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:54,180
with like the first half of the entire season. I'm
really looking forward to the show. I hope it's

221
00:21:54,180 --> 00:22:00,340
good. All I know is that the trailer was better than
the Superman trailer. And all I know is that you

222
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:10,420
know that you are lying to yourself. But that
brings us to our question of the week. Who had the

223
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:17,620
better official trailer last week? Superman or
Ironheart? Obviously the answer is Ironheart,

224
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:23,420
Team Marvel, step up, call in with your answer. Let
us know why Superman is no good. Record your answer

229
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:49,900
to answer before May 24th. Speaking of Marvel
trailers, we got the first official teaser for

230
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:56,380
Spider Noir, which is a series that's going to
debut on Amazon Prime and stars Nicholas Cage as

231
00:22:56,380 --> 00:23:01,540
Spider-Man. The Noir version of Spider-Man as he
was depicted in the Spider-Man into the

232
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:06,860
Spider-Verse animated movie. Now it's strange is
that this hasn't officially been released by

233
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:11,560
Amazon. Like it's not under official YouTube
channel or anything like that, which I thought was

234
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:17,000
strange. Yeah, the trailer was debuted during
their upfront presentation. And I don't know if it

235
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,720
was supposed to be publicly released, although
the version that some channels have put out looks

236
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,460
pretty official. It's pretty damn cool looking.
It's giving Sin City vibes. Oh, yeah. That's the

237
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:31,940
first thing I thought when I saw this and I was
instantly sold. Like these 30 seconds to me are way

238
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:37,460
better than the entire Iron Heart trailer. In the
trailer, we hear a guy talking about how this

239
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:43,440
version of New York, I think it is, needs a hero. And
we hear Nick Cage say, well, I hope it finds one.

240
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,840
There's a spider that crawls by his foot and it
looks like we see his spider sense tingling at one

241
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:53,660
point. It also crawls on his hand and we see him beat
the shit out of some bad guys. The camera work is

242
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:58,580
really damn interesting, especially for a noir
project like this, because the camera is very

243
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:04,400
dynamic. We see Spider-Man flipping on walls and
sliding across the floor. And there's one part

244
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:10,840
where he's hiding behind a bad guy and he clicks his
goggles on, which glow kind of like headlamps,

245
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,600
which I think makes for a really damn cool visual.
Yeah, it looks badass. And we really haven't seen

246
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:23,380
this kind of style of filmmaking since Sin City and
Frank Miller's The Spirit, although I never

247
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:29,240
really watched that. That was a horrible movie.
I've heard. But I mean, it looks really cool. So I'm

248
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,340
glad to see that it's being used once again for this
because this feels like it's the perfect project

249
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:39,660
for that style. It kind of looks like a great mix of
Spider-Man and Batman. I'm actually surprised

250
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:45,140
that DC has never thought to produce a noir series
with Batman like this. Well, Amazon Prime

251
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:50,800
actually does a noir style version of Batman
already in Batman Caped Crusader, the animated

252
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:56,380
series produced by Bruce Tim. If they ever did that
in live action, I think they could totally do a

253
00:24:56,380 --> 00:25:00,600
similar style to this. Absolutely, yeah. That
would be cool. I think one of the coolest things

254
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,640
about this teaser was the title card for
Spider-Nor. I really like the font that they

255
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:11,540
chose. It's very noir looking. Yeah, it's like an
art deco kind of style, but it's wonky. Yeah, the

256
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:15,640
font weight is shifted over. That gives us some
interesting character. And it's all set in

257
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:20,220
shadow, too. It's really cool looking, real
atmospheric. We learned that the show is coming

258
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:26,620
next year in 2026. So I'm really looking forward to
that. Speaking of the upfront presentations by

259
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:31,880
Studios, we learned this past week from Marvel
that Kristen Ritter will be joining the cast of

260
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:38,360
Daredevil Born Again Season 2, reprising her role
as Jessica Jones. Which means that since

261
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:44,680
Daredevil Born Again took on the continuity of the
Netflix Daredevil series and that version of

262
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:49,260
Daredevil and Jessica Jones teamed up in The
Defenders, that means that the Jessica Jones

263
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:54,880
series is also part of the MCU continuity and we'll
get to see that character return with all of that

264
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,220
established backstory. So these characters
won't be meeting each other for the first time in

265
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:04,320
season 2. They'll be meeting again and maybe
that'll even lead to a reformation of The

266
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:09,960
Defenders. But hopefully without Finn Jones. Or
he could come back and pass on the mantle of Iron

267
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,900
Fist onto a character like Lin Lee, the Sword
Master, or something like that and establish that

268
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:19,480
Iron Fist legacy. I think that would be a cool way to
use him if he came back. But it would make sense for

269
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:25,100
some heroes to show up in season 2 since we know that
at the end of season 1, Daredevil is putting

270
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,340
together basically a team to go up against the
Kingpin, who's the mayor of New York. Yeah, I have

271
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:35,120
trouble seeing how Kingpin is going to stand a
chance against a group of superpowered

272
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:41,000
vigilantes like Jessica Jones and The Other
Defenders, unless Kingpin himself starts to hire

273
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,360
out superpowered individuals, which will be
pretty cool. That would be pretty cool. I'd like to

274
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:50,980
see that. There's a lot of speculation to be had
here. I really hope they bring back Mike Coulter as

275
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:55,660
Luke Cage and then bring on some other street
heroes like Moon Knight or something like that.

276
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:00,000
Bring in Oscar Isaac and stuff like that. Who
knows? The sky's the limit. If Kristen Ritter is

277
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,860
coming back as Jessica Jones, who knows who else we
might see. We don't know the specific date, but

278
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:10,660
it's been said that the season is going to debut in
March of 2026, so a year after the first season came

279
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:15,720
out. If you guys listen to this show a lot, you'll
know that we rated Daredevil born again season 1, 4

280
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:30,720
stars out of 5, so I'm really looking forward to
season 2. The Dark Knight's definitive DC comic

281
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:52,160
stories adapted directly for audio for the very
first time. New episodes every Wednesday,

282
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:59,460
wherever you get your podcasts. But that does it
for all the news for this episode, so let's go ahead

283
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:04,040
and move into our main event, where we find out who
would win in a fight between the Greek God-powered

284
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:25,340
characters of Mary Marvel and Hercules. Alright,
Mary Marvel vs. Hercules. Now, we decided to do

285
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:30,380
this episode because Hercules is a big-time
Avengers character in the comic books. He's the

286
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:34,680
most known for being a part of that team, as well as
the champions. But, you know, he's a prominent

287
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,720
Marvel character who's fought alongside of a lot
of other Marvel characters. So we wanted to give

288
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,860
him his due. He did make an appearance at the end of
the Thor 11 Thunder movie played by Brett

289
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,340
Goldstein. Who knows if we're going to see that guy
again? But I really hope we do because he's an

290
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:53,560
awesome character, and all he knows is that he's
going to beat the crap out of Mary Marvel. People

291
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:59,980
say this. I don't know why they're smoking crack.
Because there's no way that's happening. People?

292
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,920
What people? Everyone who's claiming that
Hercules is going to beat Mary Marvel. He's

293
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:12,080
strong, and that's it. I'm pretty sure. I've seen
the Disney movie. That's all he does. Now, Mary

294
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,040
Marvel, of course, is the sister of Shazam,
initially his twin sister, and later on his

295
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:22,480
adoptive sister. But we have seen her on screen,
just like Hercules, of course, played by Grace

296
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,380
Caroline Curry in the Shazam films. If she's such a
great DC character, then why is she named after

297
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:34,500
Marvel? Because the original Captain Marvel did
not belong to Marvel, it belonged to Fawcett

298
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:41,780
Comics, who was bought by DC. Mary Marvel has gone
through a few name changes throughout the years,

299
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:47,940
especially since the new 52 relaunch of DC
continuity, like Lady Shazam. But they didn't

300
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,380
quite stick. It's because everybody knows that
Marvel's better. I'm just going to say that. And

301
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:57,080
Mary Marvel's going to learn that today. But to
explain the methodology behind our duels, let's

302
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:02,600
go to our sentient dual simulator, Alfred Jarvis
9000. AJ9K tell our listeners how you go about

303
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:25,840
determining your winner in our dual matchups.
There are many variables that can occur during

304
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:30,780
battle. The stat parameters are based on the
official Marvel power grid from which the DC

305
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:35,420
characters statistics are extrapolated.
Additional stat categories are included such as

306
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:40,940
range, damage potential, versatility and
perception in order to create a more detailed and

307
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:46,300
accurate simulation. The results of the 1000
simulations provide a percentage of wins for each

308
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,880
character. The contestant with the higher
percentage is declared the victor as they have a

309
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,180
higher probability to win any given battle. In an
equitable pairing, neither character should win

310
00:30:56,180 --> 00:31:01,500
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat

311
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,980
Superman, so the confidence rate of my method
falls in line with the precedents that have been

312
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,820
established in the source material. My
mathematical simulations are without

313
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:15,400
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for

314
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:21,160
determination of the winner. Thanks, A.J .9K!
Before we run the simulations though, we'd like to

315
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:26,220
break down each character's histories and
abilities before improvising a scenario on how we

316
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:32,240
imagine one of the 1000 simulations would play out
beat for beat. And it's my turn to go first with the

317
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:38,420
DC characters' backstory, so let me tell you all
about Mary Marvel. Now, Mary Batson was the twin

318
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:45,980
sister of Billy Batson, born to archaeologists
C.C. and Marilyn Batson. While Billy remained in

319
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:52,220
the United States, Mary accompanied her parents
on an archaeological expedition to Egypt, funded

320
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:59,240
by the villainous scientist Thaddeus Savanna.
There, Theo Adam murdered the elder Batson's and

321
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:05,820
kidnapped Mary, leaving her in the care of his
sister, Sarah Prim, back in America, where it was

322
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:13,680
arranged for Mary to be illegally adopted by Nick
and Nora Bromfield. Renamed Mary Bromfield, she

323
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:19,320
grew up in a wealthy, idealic environment unaware
of her true origins, though she was haunted by

324
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,660
reoccurring dreams of a brother she had
forgotten. Meanwhile, Billy grew up in foster

325
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,680
care and on the streets before being granted the
power of the wizard Shazam, allowing him to

326
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:37,040
transform into the hero formerly known as Captain
Marvel and better known simply as Shazam. You can

327
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:43,100
learn more about him in our Shazam vs Black Bolt
dual episode. Billy and the wizard searched for

328
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:48,720
Mary for years without success, with Billy's only
clue to her identity and whereabouts being her

329
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:55,160
favorite toy, a tiger doll named Takitani that had
been sent back from Egypt with the Batson's

330
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:01,300
belongings. As luck would have it, Mary entered a
regional spelling bee in Fawcett City, where

331
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:08,580
Billy, now working for Wiz Radio, was the MC. After
rescuing Mary from a kidnapping attempt as the

332
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:14,100
hero Shazam, Billy noticed her resemblance to his
sister and confirmed her identity through

333
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:20,640
private investigation. The truth revealed Billy
delivered the Takitani doll to Mary, who was again

334
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,880
kidnapped by the same thugs. When Mary opened the
package and saw the doll and the papers proving her

335
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:33,460
identity, Takitani came to life and instructed
her to speak the word Shazam to save her brother.

336
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:39,580
Upon doing so, she was struck by magical lightning
and transformed into the divinely powered hero.

337
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:45,620
Mary defeated the Canepers and reunited with
Billy, joining him as a member of the Marvel family

338
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:51,700
under the name Mary Marvel. Mary fought alongside
her brother Billy and his friend Freddy Freeman,

339
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:56,800
the hero known as Captain Marvel Jr., against a
variety of magical and superpowered threats in

340
00:33:56,800 --> 00:34:01,880
the universe known as Earth Five. After the
multiverse collapsed into one universe

341
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:07,720
following the crisis on Infinite Earths, Mary now
shared her power with Billy and Freddy, resulting

342
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:13,040
in a sometimes tense dynamic between the three
since the balance of magical energy shifted

343
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:19,580
depending on whoever invoked the magical word of
Shazam. At one point, a disruption in the cosmic

344
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:25,080
balance of magic prevented the marvels from
reverting to their mortal forms, forcing them to

345
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:30,020
journey to the Source Wall at the edge of the
universe to repair the broken nature of magic

346
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:36,000
itself. Mary later joined the Super Buddies, a
team of former Justice Leaguers and participated

347
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,080
in several adventures before traveling with
Supergirl. Mary was killed by a cursed dagger in

348
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:48,900
the Garden of Eden but was eventually resurrected
by one of Supergirl's allies. Following the death

349
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:54,719
of the wizard Shazam, Mary lost her powers,
causing her to fall from the sky. Though she

350
00:34:54,719 --> 00:35:01,800
survived, she fell into a coma and was cared for by
Freddy. Upon awakening, Mary was unable to access

351
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:08,220
her powers. Ignoring warnings, she traveled to
Gotham City and encountered Black Adam, who

352
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:13,760
transferred his power to Mary, transforming her
into a darker version of herself with a black

353
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,700
costume and mystical power. You can learn more
about Black Adam in our Black Adam vs. Apocalypse

354
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:25,980
dual episode. Seeking guidance with her newfound
power, Mary turned to Zatanna, Clarion the

355
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:32,820
Witchboy, and finally Eclipse, who at the time was
possessing Jean Maureen. Eclipse corrupted Mary

356
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:38,580
and attempted to offer her to Darkseid as a
concubine, though Mary rebelled and overpowered

357
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:44,440
her. Realizing the corruption her new powers had
caused, she rejected them, transferring the

358
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:50,420
tainted lightning into Eclipse. Both women fell
into the ocean, but Mary washed ashore on the

359
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:55,360
Mosquera, where she helped expose the deception
of Granny goodness, who had been impersonating

360
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:00,180
the goddess Athena to manipulate the Amazons. You
can learn more about Granny goodness in our

361
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:04,700
Darkseid's Elite vs. Black Order team dual
episode. After journeying through the

362
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:09,600
multiverse with the challengers of the unknown,
Mary eventually returned to Earth to confront

363
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:16,080
Darkseid. Secumbing to temptation, she accepted
the return of Black Adam's powers, adopting her

364
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:21,900
black costume once again. Though ultimately
freed from Darkseid's influence by Freddy,

365
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:27,300
Mary's exposure to Dark magic had lasting
consequences. After Darkseid's defeat, she

366
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:33,820
sought to join Black Adam, informing a new Black
Marvel family, but was rejected. Resolving to

367
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:40,860
operate alone, Mary became a solo heroine for a
time. Later, however, Black Adam enlisted Mary to

368
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:47,280
join him and Isis in Seizing the Rock of Eternity,
where they stripped Billy of his power. Mary

369
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,320
forced Billy to say her name, transforming him
into a corrupted Black Marvel. Together, Mary and

370
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:58,860
Billy launched an assault on the Justice Society
of America, only to be defeated when Black Adam

371
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:04,300
turned against Isis. When the wizard Shazam
resurrected, all four were stripped of their

372
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:09,800
power. The wizard declared Mary and Billy
unworthy and barred them from the Rock of

373
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:16,240
Eternity. Homeless and powerless, the twins
wandered the streets of Fawcett City. Mary was

374
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,900
later tempted by the demon Blaze to kill Freddy in
exchange for restored powers, but ultimately

375
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:27,200
sided with her brother. Together, the three
defeated Blaze and Freddy vowed to find a way to

376
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,940
restore their abilities. In post-Flashpoint
continuity, Mary was no longer Billy's twin

377
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:40,160
sister, but an unrelated older foster sister
named Mary Bromfield, the eldest foster child of

378
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:46,760
Rosa and Victor Vazquez. Having run away from an
abuse of home, she became a maternal figure among

379
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:53,040
the other foster children, including Freddy
Freeman, Darla Dudley, Pedro Pena, Eugene Choi,

380
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:58,640
and later Billy Batson. When Billy was granted the
power of Shazam, he later shared his abilities

381
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:05,260
with the other foster siblings, transforming
them into the family. Mary became a red-suited

382
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:11,080
adult version of herself gifted with the living
lightning. Alongside her family, she fought

383
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:16,320
Black Adam and other magical threats across the
Seven Magic Lands, hoping to restore her brothers

384
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,400
from the King Kid's tyranny and battling Mr. Mind
and the Monster Society of Evil. In the aftermath

385
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,300
of these events, Mary began noticing a disturbing
shift in Billy's personality, who, unbeknownst

386
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:33,420
to her, was being influenced by the Batman who
laughs, who you could learn more about in our

387
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:39,300
Batman Who Laughs vs. Cosmic Ghostwriter
episode. Billy became erratic and aggressive,

388
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:43,860
distancing himself from the rest of the Shazam
family. After tracking him to a confrontation

389
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:50,540
with the war god Ares, Mary attempted to help Billy
by fighting at Ares' side against her adopted

390
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:56,380
brother. Billy feigned remorse and tricked Mary
into lowering her guard, using his corrupted

391
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:02,380
magic to infect her with the same dark influence
that had overtaken him. Mary transformed,

392
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:07,600
adopting a more volatile demeanor, until the
corrupting force lost its grip following the fall

393
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:13,660
of the Batman Who Laughs. The Shazam family lost
their powers as Billy's connection to the Rock of

394
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:19,840
Eternity weakened. Mary visited Billy at Titans
Academy, urging him to see Freddy, whose health

395
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:26,160
was deteriorating without magic. Not long after,
Mary enrolled at Vassier College, attempting to

396
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:31,700
live a normal life. However, she was summoned by
Hoppy, the magical rabbit, sent by Billy to

397
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:39,000
deliver a message that she was now the new champion
of Shazam. After stopping a bank robbery as Lady

398
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,340
Shazam, Mary soon discovered her foster parents
had gone missing. Transferring to Fawcett City

399
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:49,000
Community College, she began investigating a
string of disappearances tied to mysterious

400
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:55,380
magical technology. Facing villains like
Disaster Master and Babbel, Mary unraveled the

401
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:00,220
mystery behind the abductions, ultimately
discovering that Georgia's Savanna, the

402
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:05,480
daughter of Thaddeus Savanna, was responsible.
Mary rescued the kidnapped townspeople,

403
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:11,220
defeated Savanna, and fully embraced her role as
the new champion of Shazam. It wasn't long,

404
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:16,620
however, that Mary sacrificed her powers during
an attack by the goddess Hera on humanity, after

405
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:22,560
which one of Roman's recently deceased mother,
Hippolyta, now ascended to Godhood, declared

406
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:28,600
Mary worthy of her own unique empowerment.
Granting her the blessings of a new pantheon of

407
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:34,960
goddesses, Hippolyta severed Mary's dependence
on the wizard Shazam, establishing her as a divine

408
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,820
champion in her own right. Powers-wise, Mary
Marvel possesses the magical ability to

409
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:46,640
transform into a superpowered version of herself
by saying the word Shazam. In her earlier

410
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,180
incarnations, her powers derived from the wizard
Shazam and were shared with her siblings.

411
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:58,020
Currently, however, Mary has her own distinct
powersets by a new pantheon of goddesses, the

412
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:06,120
agility of Selene, the strength of Hippolyta, the
stamina of Artemis, the flight of Zephyrus, the

413
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:12,780
invulnerability of Aurora, and the wisdom of
Minerva. Though she still transforms using the

414
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:18,000
word Shazam, she no longer bears the wizard's
living lightning, though she could still summon

415
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,520
Zeus's Thunderbolts. That's Mary Marvel. How
does she summon lightning if she doesn't have the

416
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:30,940
power of Zeus anymore? I don't know, man. She just
does. Zeus hears her and lightning happens.

417
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:38,020
Actually, this list of goddesses is pretty close
to her original list of deities, like Pre-Crisis,

418
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:42,840
whom she derived her powers from. Oh,
interesting. Okay. And what is her current

419
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:50,380
superhero name in the comics? Mary Marvel. Okay.
All right. I just wanted to hear that. DC's really

420
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,460
got to get over the Marvel thing, man. Like, they
just got to accept the fact that Marvel should own

421
00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:01,160
any superhero name pertaining to Marvel. Uh, no, I
think we'll keep it. She was for a while called Mary

422
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:07,720
Shazam, and that just sounds bad. That does sound
really bad. Well, let me tell you all about the

423
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:14,400
Marvel version of Hercules. Heracles
Panhellenios was born in ancient Greece as the son

424
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:21,380
of a mortal woman, Alcmenna, and Zeus, king of the
Olympian gods. Zeus seduced Alcmenna by

425
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:27,000
disguising himself as her husband, Amphitrion.
Upon discovering the affair, Zeus's wife Hera

426
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:32,880
became wrathful and tried to kill the child. Even
as an infant, Heracles displayed supernatural

427
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:38,440
strength by strangling two serpents Hera sent to
kill him in his crib. Hoping to appease the

428
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:44,500
goddess, the child was named Heracles, meaning
the glory of Hera, though it did nothing to prevent

429
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:51,140
her wrath. Heracles was raised by Amphitrion and
trained in various forms of combat. As a youth, he

430
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:56,040
accidentally killed his music teacher and was
sent away to learn to control his strength and

431
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:01,780
pursue a life of heroism. He eventually defended
the city of Thebes from a group of minion pirates

432
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:08,380
and as a reward was given the hand of the princess
Magara, daughter of King Crian. They had two

433
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:14,600
children and lived peacefully. Zeus, wanting
Heracles to prove himself worthy of immortality,

434
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:19,580
arranged for him to serve his cousin, who
instructed Heracles to complete a series of 12

435
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:26,160
impossible tasks. These would later become known
as the 12 labors of Hercules. The first labor was to

436
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,900
slay the Nemean lion, whose hide was impervious to
weapons. Heracles strangled the beast and wore

437
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:37,520
its pelt as armor. Next, he traveled to Lerno to
face the Hydra, a multi-headed serpent that

438
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:43,580
regrew two heads for everyone severed. With help
from his nephew Iolus, who cauterized the necks,

439
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:48,800
Heracles defeated the creature and dipped his
arrows in its poisonous blood. Additional tasks

440
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,220
including capturing the Arimathean boar,
hunting the sacred Serenane Hyned of Artemis, and

441
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:59,840
dispersing the Stemphalian birds created by
Ares. He cleaned the Aegean stables by diverting

442
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:05,460
two rivers, captured the Cretan bull, stole the
man-eating mares of Diomedes, and obtained the

443
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:10,900
Amazon Queen Hippolyta's Golden Girdle. He then
slew the three-bodied Gurian to claim his red

444
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:16,260
cattle and tricked the Titan Atlas into helping
him retrieve Golden Apples from the Garden of

445
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:21,180
Hesperides. The final labor was the most
harrowing, descending into the underworld to

446
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:26,860
retrieve Cerberus, the three-headed guard dog of
Hades. His success completing all 12 labors

447
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:33,160
earned him recognition from the gods, but his
return to his home of Thebes was marked by tragedy.

448
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:39,060
During his absence, Thebes had been overtaken by
an outside nobleman named Lycus, who killed King

449
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:44,860
Crian and condemned Megara and her children to
death. Blood lusted and driven mad by a curse from

450
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:52,180
Hera, Heracles killed not only Lycus, but also his
wife Megara and their two sons. Haunted by shame,

451
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:58,020
he began using the Romanized version of his name,
Hercules, to distance himself from both Hera and

452
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:03,620
his past. Hercules adventured across the ancient
world. He killed Keknos, son of Ares, who was

453
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:08,760
murdering travelers to construct a temple from
their bones. When King Glamiden of Troy refused to

454
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,360
pay Hercules for saving his daughter from a sea
monster, Hercules raised the city, killing the

455
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:19,020
king and all his sons saved one. He battled the
river god Acherus for the hand of Daenerys, who

456
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:25,000
would become his next wife. Eventually, Hercules
met his mortal end after Daenerys, fearing that he

457
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,620
had been unfaithful, unknowingly poisoned him
with what she believed was a love potion. Feeling

458
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:36,520
sympathy for his son, Zeus separated Hercules'
mortal body from his divine spirit and raised him

459
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:42,180
to Olympus as the new god of strength. Though now
divine, Hercules retained his love for adventure

460
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:47,960
and he returned to earth often. He participated in
the first Olympic games, allegedly battled

461
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:53,220
Vikings, and claimed an affair with Marie
Antoinette. During World War II, he fought for the

462
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:58,080
Greek resistance while disguised as the
Submariner to avoid punishment from Olympus for

463
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:04,560
intervening in human affairs. In the modern era,
he emerged again and met Thor, joining him on the

464
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,700
Avengers. Deceived into signing a contract by
Pluto, Hercules was nearly trapped in the

465
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:14,760
underworld again until Thor rescued him. He later
fell under the Enchantress's spell and fought the

466
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:19,420
Avengers before regaining his senses. Exiled
from Olympus for coming to earth without

467
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:25,940
permission, Hercules remained with the
Avengers, battling Dragon Man, Typhon, and Ares.

468
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:30,240
You can learn more about the Avengers and their
team duel against the Justice League. Hercules

469
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,580
became a founding member of another superhero
team called the Champions, alongside Black

470
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:40,640
Widow, Iceman, Angel, and Goshreiter. He and
Black Widow developed a romantic interlude.

471
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,320
Later, Hercules was beaten into a coma by the
Masters of Evil after attempting to battle them

472
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:51,160
alone while intoxicated. Zeus blamed the
Avengers for his son's coma and imprisoned them in

473
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:56,600
Hades, but Hercules awoke, cleared their names,
and brokered peace. You can learn more about the

474
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:01,500
Masters of Evil and their team duel against the
Hercules later helped fight the High

475
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:06,460
Evolutionary and Dr. Doom. He was devastated by
the apparent deaths of the Avengers during their

476
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:11,480
battle with Onslaught, a psychic entity you can
learn more about in his duel against Parallax. He

477
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:16,840
joined Heroes for Hire and Shield before
rejoining the Avengers upon the Hero's return and

478
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:21,540
fought with the team until its dissolution at the
hands of the Scarlet Witch, who split the team

479
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:27,360
apart in a fit of madness. You can learn more about
that in the 10 versus Scarlet Witch duel episode.

480
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:32,800
Without his team, Hercules fell into depression,
a moment of vulnerability exploited by Hera and

481
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,740
Eurystheus. They challenged him to complete a
modern version of the 12 labors, this time as part

482
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:43,240
of a reality television show. Among his
challenges, Hercules captured a Sabertooth

483
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:49,200
Tiger in the Savage Land, defeated a Hydra
genetically created by Hydra, captured the

484
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,280
teleporting dog Lockjaw from the Blue Area of the
Moon, fought Dragon Man, and drove Atuma's Hordes

485
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:01,000
from Atlantis. Later tasks involved surviving
Red Skull's Dust of Death, defeating the

486
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,920
Abomination, capturing a monster in Hawaii,
stealing Captain America's Shield, retrieving a

487
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:12,300
Doombot from Laveria, dragging a Shield
Helicarrier by Chain, and returning to the

488
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:18,660
Underworld to retrieve a flower from his former
wife, Megara. In Hades, Megara and their children

489
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:23,480
forgave Hercules for their murder,
understanding Hera's role in the tragedy, and she

490
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:27,780
gave him a flower of love. He opposed the
Superhuman Registration Act during the

491
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:33,220
superhero Civil War and joined Captain America's
Secret Avengers. In the final battle, he

492
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:39,280
destroyed the Thor clone Ragnarok, claiming it
was an insult to the real Thor. He later formed the

493
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:46,000
Renegades with Amadeus Cho, Namora, and others to
aid the Hulk upon his return from being exiled by

494
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,540
some of Earth's heroes to space, empathizing with
a fellow warrior. When the Skrulls secretly

495
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:56,840
invaded Earth on behalf of their alien deities,
Hercules led a team of gods from multiple

496
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:03,460
pantheons called the God Squad. This included
Snowbird, the Inuit Demigoddess, Ajek, the

497
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:10,920
Eternal, the Egyptian Godslayer Demigorge, and
Mikaboshi, the Shinto God of Chaos. Together,

498
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:17,340
they slayed the Skrull gods, Kleibin and Sigurt.
Eventually, Mikaboshi evolved into a new entity

499
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:23,280
called the Chaos King and began destroying all
realms of the afterlife. Hercules reunited with

500
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,640
the God Squad to seal the entity away, but he
expanded all his godly energy in the process,

501
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,520
becoming mortal. Hercules settled in Brooklyn,
bartending at a Greek restaurant and using

502
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:38,740
magical weapons from his brother Aerys' armory,
such as the Sword of Pellius and Perseus' shield.

503
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:43,600
During the Norse god of fear, the Serpent's
attack, Hercules helped save Brooklyn from

504
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:49,040
becoming a Hellscape and became a local hero. He
later served as a guest instructor at the Avengers

505
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:55,100
Academy and fought against a new pantheon of gods
that included the God of Data and the Goddess of

506
00:49:55,100 --> 00:50:00,660
Vanity. After defeating them, he declined to
return to Olympus, choosing instead to live among

507
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:05,680
mortals. Hercules rejoined the Avengers during
their fight against King the Conqueror and later

508
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:10,160
helped a new iteration of the champions,
eventually regaining his godhood with help from

509
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:16,060
god particle scientist, Roshna Cole. He later
learned Nix, the Greek goddess of night, had slain

510
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:21,680
most of the Olympian gods, who subsequently
returned in a corrupted form. Hercules was

511
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:27,680
captured by these dark gods, but was rescued by the
Guardians of the Galaxy. After helping that team

512
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:32,740
exile the dark gods, Hercules returned to Earth
and helped the Avengers fight off a vampire

513
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:38,180
invasion. And that's Hercules' backstory.
Powers-wise, Hercules, as the Greek god of

514
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:43,980
strength, is the physically strongest of all the
Olympian gods, unable to lift well in excess of 100

515
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:49,380
tons. He is also the most durable of his pantheon,
with his invulnerability, unable to run at speeds

516
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:56,020
around 100mph and leap 100 feet in the air. His
immortality grants him limitless stamina,

517
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:01,420
regenerative healing, and toxin resistance. He
is a master combatant in Greco-Roman wrestling

518
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:08,020
and wields a number of mythological weapons,
including his indestructible adamantine mace

519
00:51:08,020 --> 00:51:14,260
forged by his brother Hephaestus, the sword of
Pellius, a curved syca forged by the centaur

520
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:19,060
Kyren, the shield of Perseus, which can
temporarily turn observers to stone when the

521
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:25,600
shield's covers removed, and the bow of Hercules,
with arrows dipped in hydra blood. And that is

522
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:32,400
Hercules. Okay, so he just carries all of these
weapons around with him at all times? Usually when

523
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:38,800
I see him, he's just holding this golden hammer
club thing. Well, modern comics, Hercules is

524
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:43,980
usually depicted actually with his mace and the
sword of Pellius, but he's gone on multiple

525
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:50,760
adventures with the shield. Actually, I less
commonly see him use the bow, but it's his, it's

526
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:56,980
named after him, it's the bow of Hercules, and
yeah, he'll have it for this fight. Okay, cheater.

527
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:01,080
At the very least, he'll have the mace and the
sword, because he almost always carries those

528
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:06,160
around now. They're like strapped on his back like
an X, but we'll say that the shield covers that, and

529
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:11,580
then you know, the bow is just strapped to his side,
we'll say, I don't know. Yeah, having the sword and

530
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:18,980
the shield and the mace and the quiver and the bow on
his back is a lot. That's, it's probably too much,

531
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:23,700
you're right. I guess he won't have the bow for this
match, since yeah, it's less commonly used, but

532
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:53,760
he'll at least have his sword, his shield, and his
mace. We'll say that. Dual, where comic book

533
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:59,480
titans smash every Tuesday. Max destruction,
where TV and action heroes battle every

534
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:05,820
Wednesday, and Sendro World, where anime
champions clash every Thursday. Join us as we

535
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:11,020
speculate on the matches and armed with the power
of mathematical simulations, discover who will

536
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:20,760
emerge victorious. Visit dynamicpodcast.com,
where we settle the debate and settle the score.

537
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:25,060
But now that we got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one of the

538
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:30,640
1000 simulated matches will go. The winner is
determined by simulations, not the speculation,

539
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:36,080
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could play
out. AJ9K, what are the rules or speculation?

540
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:40,760
Well, I should say there are no rules other than the
characters have no prior knowledge of the other

541
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:45,520
going into the fight. All they are aware of
starting out is that the other character is a

542
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:49,880
threat that needs to be eliminated. For the
speculation, the contestants will begin

543
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:55,280
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript
environment that will have no bearing on the match

544
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:00,180
itself, as no environmental statistics are
considered in my simulations. The contestants

545
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:05,460
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright,
then let's get into it. Mary Marble and Hercules

546
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:12,140
meet on the battlefield. Who goes first? Now, I
will admit that probably because of the wisdom of

547
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:18,920
Minerva, Mary Marble wouldn't go first and would
probably wait to observe where Hercules would do.

548
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:24,560
Yeah, plus Hercules is more belligerent than
Mary, right? So yeah, he's gonna go first, and he's

549
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:29,200
gonna start out by pulling out his Mace, his
adamantine Mace, and he's gonna slam it into the

550
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:34,540
ground, which is gonna create this big
earth-shattering earthquake that's gonna open

551
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:41,180
this fissure that travels along the ground and
knocks Mary into the air with seismic force. Okay,

552
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:46,160
yeah, that's fine. Mary stays floating in the air
thanks to the flight of Zephyrus, one of her

553
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:52,760
powers, and she's probably gonna snatch one of the
boulders that are also flung upward, and she's

554
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:58,080
gonna hurl that sucker right at Hercules with the
strength of Hippolyta. Alright, so Hercules sees

555
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:03,440
this boulder being thrown at him, and he's gonna
spin around while holding his Mace out, kind of

556
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:08,580
like how an Olympian would do in the Hammer Throw
event at the Olympics, and he's gonna let go of the

557
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:13,960
Mace hurling it at the boulder, which just
explodes the rock into pebbles in the air, and the

558
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:19,160
Mace is actually gonna travel through the boulder
and slam right into Mary Marble, which is gonna

559
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:25,260
knock her out of the air, and she's probably like in
a coma now on the ground. Now, she has the agility of

560
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:32,800
Selene, so Mary's actually gonna dodge the Mace,
and she's gonna rock it down into the ground and

561
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:38,220
cause her own like miniature earthquake that's
gonna knock Hercules into the air, and that's

562
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:44,240
gonna give her this opening, and she's going to
just uppercut him right into the stratosphere.

563
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:49,260
No, no, she tries to uppercut him, but he catches
her fist as she tries to, and then he's gonna

564
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:54,980
grapple her flinging her over his shoulder, and
then position her head down to do this like pile

565
00:55:54,980 --> 00:56:00,260
driver move right into the ground. So he slams her
down, and now they're both in this big crater.

566
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:06,800
Okay, well, you know, thanks to the
invulnerability of Aurora, Mary's not that hurt.

567
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:13,200
And with Hercules on top of her pinning her down,
that's when Mary is going to just call out Shazam

568
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:19,540
summoning Zeus's lightning, which is gonna crash
into Hercules and just stun the shit out of him. And

569
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:24,880
with him dazed, that's when Mary just kicks
Hercules right in the balls with all of her

570
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:30,680
strength. No, no, Hercules has his shield on his
back. So he's not going to be stunned from Zeus's

571
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,960
lightning, because the shield is going to protect
him. So he's going to leap to his feet, you know,

572
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:40,280
dodging this kick from Mary Marvel, and then he's
going to equip the shield of Perseus and the sword

573
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:45,720
of Pellius from off his back into his arms. And he's
going to raise the sword above his head and come

574
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:51,040
down with a mighty chop that's just going to finish
Mary Marvel off and end this match. Well, except

575
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:56,380
when Hercules is coming down on her with his sword,
Mary's gonna, you know, clap her hands together

576
00:56:56,380 --> 00:57:02,480
above her, stopping the blade in her palms. And
that's when she's going to scream again, Shazam a

577
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:07,880
second time. And a lightning bullet is going to
come down, strike the tip of the blade, and that

578
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:14,260
electricity is going to move through the sword
into Hercules body and just fry his brain. And

579
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:18,640
yeah, since the lightning passed through Mary,
she probably transforms back into her mortal

580
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:25,200
form. But since Hercules is now dead, it doesn't
matter. She wins. Now, I think Hercules is too

581
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:31,240
durable to be finished with just one bolt of magic
lightning. You know, he's hurt for sure, but he's

582
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:37,840
not dead. He's on the ground, injured. And as Mary
stands up, you know, she's in her mortal form now.

583
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:42,440
From the ground, Hercules just chucks his shield
right at her, walloping her and taking her out

584
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:46,780
because she doesn't have her enhanced durability
anymore. Oh no, I mean, she saw that Hercules

585
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:52,260
didn't die from this electricity. So right away,
she's going to cry out Shazam once again, as the

586
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:57,840
shield is hurtling towards her. And the lightning
bolt that strikes her, allowing her to transform

587
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:04,360
the energy from that ricochets the shield back
toward Hercules. And it's just going to

588
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:10,520
decapitate him straight up. Okay. No, but
Hercules is not a chump who'd get taken out with his

589
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:16,480
own shield. Okay, these catches the shield as it
ricochets back toward him. But that lightning

590
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:23,200
bolt explosion, just incinerated the cloth cover
that was over the shield. So Hercules wheels the

591
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:29,640
shield again, and Medusa's face is now visible on
the front of the shield, and her eyes glow green,

592
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:36,040
and the shield turns Mary Marvel into stone. And
that's when Hercules leaps over and just double

593
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:42,100
drop kicks the Mary Marvel statue, and she gets
shattered to gravel for sure, ending this match.

594
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:47,560
Well, I mean, you're right about the lightning
bolt incinerating the shield cover, but not right

595
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:53,480
about Hercules catching it because as it was
traveling back toward him, he saw Medusa's visage

596
00:58:53,480 --> 00:59:00,020
in the shield. So he turned to stone first, after
which the shield just shattered him to gravel as it

597
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:05,280
collided with him. And Mary Marvel knew this was
going to happen, because you know, she recognized

598
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:10,500
the shield cover due to her wisdom of Minerva. How
would she recognize the shield cover? Just

599
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,920
because the shield exists in Greek mythology
doesn't mean it's going to be like the same looking

600
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:20,820
shield with the same looking cover. Of course it
does, bro. Of course it does. And even if it wasn't

601
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:26,280
the same, Minerva would recognize it. Well, you
better recognize that's dumb. But let's find out

602
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:32,360
which of these scenarios happens. Either the
shield of Perseus turns Mary Marvel into stone and

603
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:37,760
then he kicks her to pieces, or the shield of
Perseus turns Hercules into stone as it's

604
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:42,420
traveling toward him and then crashes into him,
shattering him to pieces. Let's go ahead and find

605
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:47,060
out which of these scenarios happens by inputting
the character stats, running their simulations,

606
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:54,000
and coming back with a winner. AJ9K hit it.
Inputting data, running calculations,

607
00:59:54,000 --> 01:00:00,080
processing results, simulations complete.
Okay, so this was a pretty decent matchup way

608
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:04,880
better than I thought it was going to be initially
because I figured Mary Marvel has all of the

609
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:09,760
powers, but it turned out they were pretty
comparable to Hercules. Yeah, I guess the main

610
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:15,960
difference was that Mary Marvel had the lightning
and the power of flight, but Hercules had a few

611
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:20,020
weapons that gave them the edge in a few
categories. Right off the bat, we said that Mary

612
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:25,580
Marvel was faster than Hercules. There's just no
denying that. But since we accounted for the

613
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:31,100
weapons that Hercules had in the speculation, in
these stats, we said that Hercules had a slight

614
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:36,380
edge in evasiveness because he had his shield. For
the purposes of the stats we gave him his shield,

615
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:41,420
his mace, and his sword. Yeah, Hercules also got
the edge when it came to fighting since he's an

616
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:48,200
expert in wrestling and range, surprisingly,
because Mary Marvel doesn't wield her lightning

617
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:53,080
in the same way that Billy does, especially now in
the comics. Yeah, whereas Hercules can throw all

618
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:58,600
of his weapons with great strength and accuracy.
We did give Mary Marvel the edge when it came to

619
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:03,940
perception thanks to her wisdom of Minerva,
allows her to see things that normal people

620
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:09,180
wouldn't be able to see. But for the rest of the
stats, from durability, strength, damage, and

621
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:14,980
versatility, they were even. So, Joseph, with all
of the stats and consideration, who do you think

622
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:19,380
came out on top? I'm going to give it to my boy,
Hercules. I've got to give it to him. I think what he

623
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:26,300
lacks in lightning power, he makes up for in being a
badass with his mace and a few of the other weapons

624
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:31,960
from Ares' armory. And Instagram agrees with me
because 65% of the poll takers sided with

625
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:37,780
Hercules, believing that he'll win. Which
baffles me because... Why? It's freaking Mary

626
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:42,780
Marvel. She essentially has the powers of Shazam,
this insanely powerful Superman-level

627
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:47,340
character. Yeah, but Hercules is like a
well-established Greek mythological figure,

628
01:01:47,340 --> 01:01:53,960
whereas Mary Marvel's just this side character in
the Shazam comic book mythos. Hercules is a Disney

629
01:01:53,960 --> 01:02:00,160
cartoon, bro. You're thinking of the wrong
Hercules that people are familiar with. Let's

630
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:07,060
find out if you and our Instagram poll takers have
any clue what they're talking about. AJ9K, the

631
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:15,140
results, please. Here you are, sir. The winner of
the matchup between Mary Marvel and Hercules

632
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:27,660
is... Fucking Hercules. Hercules, Hercules,
Hercules. He won by 577 of the 1000 matches or

633
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:36,560
57.7%. Mary Marvel won 423 of those 1000 matches.
To me, this makes sense. You know, there's some

634
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:42,640
people out there that may balk at me giving
Hercules the mace and the sword and the shield, but

635
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:46,800
a lot of current depictions have him wielding both
the sword and the mace. And even if he just had the

636
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:52,380
mace, you know, he could use that defensively in
the same way that Thor uses Mjolnir. The only thing

637
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:57,080
that just the mace would do for him statistically
is that it would lower his versatility because he

638
01:02:57,080 --> 01:03:02,120
wouldn't be able to turn Mary Marvel into stone
with the shield of Perseus. So take that away, and

639
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:07,800
this is still a coin toss. So either way, you can't
discount Hercules beating Mary Marvel. I hate

640
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:14,580
that Hercules won. Like, Mary Marvel is just too
near and dear to DC fans' hearts. Hercules is just a

641
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:21,400
jerk. He's Jerkely's. Jerkely's. Now, he's a
pretty endearing character, too. He has a good

642
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:25,820
heart in the comic books. I can't wait to see him in
live action. Hopefully, you know, they do

643
01:03:25,820 --> 01:03:30,640
something with the character besides just that
end credit stinger that we saw in Thor 11 Thunder.

644
01:03:30,640 --> 01:04:02,740
But that does it for this duel, guys. HN9K, help
close us out. MaxDistruction, Senjo World, and

645
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:11,180
Console Combat. As I mentioned earlier, our next
episode is going to be another team duel this time,

646
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:16,860
repeating DC's Infinity Inc. against Marvel's
new warriors. Yeah, I don't know much about

647
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:22,000
Infinity Inc. I guess they're kind of a legacy team
for the Justice Society. Right. So they're like a

648
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:27,160
younger group, but sort of the new warriors, which
consists of characters like Nova, Speedball,

649
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:32,180
Night Thrasher, people like that. We'll break
down the rosters and the team's histories in our

650
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:36,340
next episode. But that does it for this episode. We
want to give a big thanks to our executive
