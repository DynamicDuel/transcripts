00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:27,560
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi and welcome
to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,080
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,780
their characters and stat based battle
simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe and I'm his twin

4
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,200
brother Johnny DC. And in this episode
Abomination is going to beat the Everleaven shit

5
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,180
out of Bizarro and I'm going to laugh about it. It's
going to be funny to me. I'm going to listen back to

6
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:53,980
this episode and have a swell ass time. Dude, you
are never going to learn your lesson, are you? DC's

7
00:00:53,980 --> 00:01:00,460
just better. Learn. I'm putting positive energy
out there from the get go for Marvel, okay? Because

8
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:05,440
you feel you need it? No, because it's just good to
have positive energy for Marvel. It goes out into

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,920
the universe and then it's going to come back to me
when we reveal the results after running the

10
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,060
simulations on these characters. Well, I guess
we'll see. I'm manifesting it in my brain, in your

11
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,640
butthole. That too. Join us later on this episode
as we input the character stats and find out who

12
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:25,640
would actually win in a fight between these two
characters. Before that matchup, we're going to

13
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,380
break down the latest comic book movie news to come
out this past week of which we have two news items

14
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:37,080
and that was that the Penguin won nine Emmy Awards
and actually on the comic book news side, we're

15
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,040
going to discuss the Deadpool Batman crossover
issue. We're not going to give spoilers away.

16
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,780
We're just going to talk about what was inside of it
and what we thought of it. Yeah, looking forward to

17
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,880
that. We've never talked about comics, but we
figured this is a special occasion. But as always,

18
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,780
we list our segment times in our episode
description. So feel free to check out the show

38
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,780
notes to listen to all the shows in the Dynamite
podcast network. But with that out of the way,

39
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:49,420
quick to the no prize. A no prize is an award that
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version, the

40
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:55,220
Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award we post on
Instagram for the person that we feel gave the best

41
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,440
answer to our question of the week. And just a heads
up, I am way behind on posting these no prizes to

42
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:06,440
Instagram. I've been busy with work, but slowly
trying to catch up. At this point, you're going to

43
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:12,820
spend the rest of your life catching up. Maybe.
Yeah. I suck. I know. All right. Last week we asked

44
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:18,420
you guys, besides Marvel and DC, what is your
favorite film franchise of all time and why? And

45
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:23,940
that's coming off of the variety report on current
film franchises that we discussed last week. We

46
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:29,120
got five answers. So let's run down our honorable
mentions as well as the no prize winner. Our first

47
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,140
honorable mention goes to Alex Albro, who said,
Hey guys, my favorite franchise of all time is Star

48
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:41,020
Wars, probably more so than Marvel and DC, to be
honest. Caviar, though, it's pre Disney. There's

49
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,620
been a few things that Disney's put out that are
okay, but I really prefer the George Lucas stuff so

50
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,780
much so I can quote the movies to you pretty much
without watching them. I've read a lot of the lore

51
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,620
and legends books as they're called now. Even in
fifth grade for a writing assignment, I wrote

52
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:59,860
about a 20-ish page script for episode seven
because it had yet to come out. So just based on head

53
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,360
knowledge and canon. So yeah, I feel like I used to
be a fan of Star Wars until Disney ruined it. Like

54
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,660
they ruin everything they touch. I thought your
favorite Star Wars movie was Rogue One, which was

55
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:18,440
produced after the Disney acquisition. Is that
true? Shit. Yes. Mandalorian's great. Rogue One

56
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,320
was great. I will put out a controversial takeout
there. I actually liked The Last Jedi. Brother,

57
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:32,680
ew! Why brother? Ew. I really like the end of that
movie when Luke Skywalker went all badass on Kylo

58
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,980
Ren, you know? He like force projected himself
over the galaxy. I thought that was a really cool

59
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:42,820
moment. It was everything I wanted to see in a
badass Luke Skywalker Jedi moment. I know that,

60
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,460
you know, that story didn't even come close to
touching what was in the novels though. Oh yeah,

61
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:51,100
with like Mara Jade and their sign and stuff like
that? Yeah. They should have just went with that.

62
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:55,680
They should have just went with that. Did not like
Force Awakens and thought Rise of Skywalker was

63
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,420
pretty meh. I feel like everybody has an opinion on
Star Wars though. So like basically nobody is

64
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:06,460
going to agree with my three takes right there. Oh
yeah, I've gotten flack for saying that Rogue One

65
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:11,720
is the best Star Wars movie, even though I'm right.
Great answer, Alex. Our next honorable mention

66
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:20,560
goes to Kylo, who said. Hi guys. My favorite film
franchise has to be The Hunger Games because they

67
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:28,540
have really good characters and I love the world
that the author Susan Collins built. And the

68
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:34,340
movies are really, like really good. So I cannot
recommend them enough if you haven't seen them.

69
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:38,900
But yeah, that's my answer. Thank you. Yeah, my
daughter is a huge fan of The Hunger Game

70
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:45,160
franchise. She's read all of the books. I've seen
the movies multiple times because she has. I

71
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,140
didn't love the first one when I sat in the theaters
because I thought it was kind of anti climactic and

72
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:55,140
Katniss was kind of passive when it comes to
heroism. But the later films I thought were

73
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:59,620
actually really good. I'm a huge fan of the
director Francis Lawrence, who also directed

74
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,440
Constantine. I've only seen the first Hunger
Games movie, which I thought was decent enough.

75
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:10,940
And I just went on living my life and not seeing the
other ones. Is that a mistake? Um, yeah, you should

76
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:15,880
watch them. They're not bad. I'm just going to
continue living all my life, I think. OK, great

77
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:23,280
answer, Kylo. Our final honorable mention goes to
Lorenzo Valdez, who said. Besides DC and Marvel,

78
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,900
my all time favorite film franchise is The
Wizarding World. I love coming of age stories and

79
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:35,080
much like with DC and Marvel, it was a huge part of my
childhood. Clona Forever and always. Bye bye. OK,

80
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:41,840
so my wife is a huge fan of the Harry Potter series.
She grew up with the books and the movies. And

81
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,760
before I met her, I had only seen the first Harry
Potter and I thought it sucked. And it still does

82
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,840
suck to this date is my least favorite Harry Potter
film. And then I went and watched the rest of those

83
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,320
films and they got progressively darker and
progressively more mature. And I really got into

84
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:05,980
them by the last few films. So yeah, I'm a big fan,
too. So I've only seen like the first two movies. I

85
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,360
watched them and then I kind of just went on living
my life. Yeah, I'm a stay. Yeah, I would say that's a

86
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:17,560
mistake because the latter stories get really
like thematic and existential and dark, like dark

87
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,720
as hell, like depressingly dark. Even I was
surprised just to how like depressed these kids

88
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,000
get. And I'll probably just end up living my life.
I'll watch Hunger Games if you finish watching the

89
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,120
Harry Potter movies and we'll come to a consensus
on which franchise is better. How is that even

90
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:37,039
fair? There's way more Harry Potter movies. Ain't
nobody got time for that. There's only like six of

91
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,700
them. Yeah, including the Fantastic Beasts
movies. Oh, yeah, the first Fantastic Beasts

92
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,980
movie was OK. I didn't like the latter two, though.
But yeah, you got to watch those two. Great answer,

93
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,180
Lorenzo. But the winner of this week's no prize is
actually split between two people who gave the

94
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:58,900
same answer and that would be CJ Kraft and Brandon
Estregard, who said, hey, guys, CJ Kraft here and

95
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:04,780
my favorite film franchise of all time. Without
question is the Evil Dead because it's Groovy

96
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:11,480
Duck. And Ash has actually been in the Marvel
comics and Marvel zombies, where he was eaten by my

97
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:17,360
favorite Marvel character. How are the duck only
for the real Ash to come in and kill that? How are the

98
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:23,140
duck? If that's not awesome enough to want to be in
the best, I don't know what it is. Hey, guys,

99
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:28,960
besides DC or Marvel, I'm a huge horror movie fan.
And my favorite horror movie franchise is the Evil

100
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:35,320
Dead series. They do start off pretty campy with
the first ones, the Sam Raimi ones. And then the

101
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:43,840
intensity just dials up to a fucking 11 with Fadea
Alvarez's and then to a 20 with Lee Cronin's. So

102
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,300
yeah, favorite franchise of all time. Yeah, I've
seen about half of the Evil Dead movies, and I'll

103
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,940
agree that they are damn solid. The Sam Raimi films
are campy. I haven't seen Army of Darkness because

104
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,800
I heard that it wasn't that scary, but I'll
definitely have to check it out at some point. And I

105
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:04,340
haven't seen the latest one, Evil Dead Rises yet,
because I don't know, it looked really scary. And

106
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:10,260
so I'm kind of just like waiting for a time when I'm
ready to be that scared, probably around this

107
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:16,080
Halloween. The only Evil Dead movie I've seen is
the original Sam Raimi one. I haven't seen the

108
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,640
sequels to that, like Army of Darkness or anything
like that. Although I've heard they're pretty

109
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:25,640
good. Pretty much classics. I basically refused
to see the new ones after seeing the red band

110
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:32,860
trailer for the Fadea Alvarez directed one. F
that. Yeah, they're pretty gruesome for sure. But

111
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:38,620
I'm glad you guys like them. So congrats on the win,
both CJ and Brandon. If you, the listener, want a

112
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,500
shot at winning Girono Prize, stay tuned to later
on this episode when we'll be asking another

113
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:54,260
question of the week. And now that that's done, on
to the news. OK, last week, actress Kristen

114
00:10:54,260 --> 00:11:00,380
Miliotti, who played Sophia Felcone in the
Penguin television series for HBO Max, won the

115
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:07,340
Emmy for Outstanding Gleed Actress in a Limited or
Anthology Series or Movie, which is awesome. Of

116
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:11,300
course, the Emmys, if you're not familiar with
them, are essentially like the Oscars for

117
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,440
television. It is the most prestigious award that
television creators can receive. And the Penguin

118
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:27,160
won nine of them. Nine. How many Emmys did Marvel
win this past year? Zero. They won zero to nine.

119
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:35,000
Feel bad, Marvel fans. Feel real bad. Of the nine
Emmys, the Penguin also won for costumes, for hair

120
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:43,420
styling, for makeup, for prosthetic makeup, for
music composition, for sound editing, sound

121
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:51,120
mixing and Outstanding Special Visual Effects,
which again, suck it, Marvel, with your Agatha All

122
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,560
Alongs and your Echoes and X-Men 97s. I'm sorry.
Were you saying something? I was really paying

123
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:01,980
attention. Yeah, you wouldn't be, because you
know it's a boring story, man. OK, this is a boring

124
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:07,120
story. You talking about the Emmys or something?
Yeah. Yeah, I guess those are cool. I am a little bit

125
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,540
bummed that X-Men 97 did not win Outstanding
Animated Program and that Agatha All Along didn't

126
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:17,780
win any awards either. I thought those were two
really solid shows. But yeah, I mean, if you like

127
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:24,040
Emmys, whatever. Oh, hell, yeah, bro, the Penguin
loves its Emmys. Ew, it was a fantastic show. We

128
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,960
gave it five stars when we reviewed it on this
podcast. Yeah, it's pretty good if you like that

129
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:34,520
kind of thing. There were originally no plans to do
a season two, and it has been stated that Sophie

130
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:40,580
Falcone will not appear in the Batman sequel. But I
would love to see more from Christian Miliotti's

131
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:46,240
character. So fingers crossed for the Penguin
season two. Apparently, the Penguin is an HBO's 10

132
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:52,320
highest rated TV shows of all time, and it deserves
to be because it's awesome. Oh my god, let's move on

133
00:12:52,320 --> 00:13:00,080
to the real news here. OK, in actual news this past
week, the Deadpool Batman comic book hit stores,

134
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,760
and it is the first Marvel DC crossover to happen in
probably about two decades. I think I can't

135
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,020
remember the exact year that JLA Adventures came
out, but it was definitely the mid 2000s. And that

136
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:17,180
was a solid, solid run. And of course, it was
preceded by the Marvel versus DC crossover that

137
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:23,900
happened in the mid 90s. Both of those comic book
arcs were like multi issue stories. The Deadpool

138
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:28,680
Batman crossover comic that came out this past
week is actually more of a series of one shots

139
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:35,740
between Marvel and DC characters. The first
story, of course, is Deadpool and Batman. And I

140
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,200
fucking loved that story. It was basically
everything you would ever want in a Deadpool

141
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:46,220
Batman crossover. Deadpool was hilarious.
Batman was badass. It was just perfection the way

142
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,760
they pulled that story together. But to my
surprise, there were six other short stories

143
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,140
within that issue. It was a pretty big issue. But
following Deadpool Batman, you got a Captain

144
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:00,620
America Wonder Woman crossover, which was pretty
good. It kind of treated the Marvel and DC

145
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:06,200
universes as if they were one single universe and
explored the relationship between Steve Rogers

146
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,240
and Diana Prince. Then there was Jeff, the Land
Shark and Crypto crossover, where the two play

147
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,460
catch. There was Daredevil and Green Arrow, which
was written by Kevin Smith, the acclaimed film

148
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:22,580
director, who also wrote runs for Green Arrow and
Daredevil. There was an arc with Rocket Raccoon

149
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:27,480
and Green Lantern, where Rocket Raccoon gets the
Green Lantern ring and Green Lantern gets the

150
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:32,760
Infinity Gauntlet and kind of explores what would
happen there. There was an old man Logan and

151
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:38,220
Batman, the Dark Knight Returns version
crossover that was written by Frank Miller. And

152
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:44,660
goddamn, that was awful. Frank Miller is just
getting so bad at drawing and writing. It's just it

153
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:49,180
was really disappointing, that particular short
story. It was only like two pages, two. Yeah, it's

154
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:55,220
sad to see he probably should have quit while he was
on top. Yeah. The final crossover episode kind of

155
00:14:55,220 --> 00:15:01,040
revisits the amalgam universe from the 90s
crossover event where Marvel and DC characters

156
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,300
fused into single beings. Like you had characters
like Dark Claw, who was a merger of Batman and

157
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:12,620
Wolverine. This particular short story focuses
on Logo, who is a crossover between Wolverine and

158
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:19,360
Lobo, the bounty hunter. And that is fantastic
because he has those chain hook things coming out

159
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,160
of his hands and he could shoot them out to capture
bad guys. It's really badass. Yeah, I got to love

160
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,540
those amalgam characters. All in all, while I have
been dying for another full on crossover event

161
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:35,200
between Marvel and DC, these one off shorts did
satiate my appetite for having the two universes

162
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,980
go head to head. And they're not done because the
second part of the Batman and Deadpool story will

163
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:45,820
be released in mid November. Yeah, I'm really
looking forward to that one. If you guys haven't

164
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:50,440
picked up the issue yet from your local comic book
store, be sure to do that or read it online. If you

165
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,180
can, if you're a fan of Deadpool or you're a fan of
Batman, it's absolutely worth your time,

166
00:15:55,180 --> 00:16:04,520
especially since the comic book ties into our

172
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:41,780
27th. But that does it for all the news for this
episode. So let's go ahead and get into the main

173
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:47,460
event where we find out who would win in a fight
between the Superman villain of Bizarro and the

174
00:16:47,460 --> 00:17:08,460
Hulk villain Abomination. All right, Bizarro
versus Abomination. This is in effect a Superman

175
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:14,960
versus Hulk matchup, which we have not gotten to
yet, but was featured in the 90s crossover event

176
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:19,319
between Marvel and DC. Superman and Hulk fought
each other. We're going to riff on that a little bit

177
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:22,780
and go with the villains. And I think this will be a
little bit more even, largely because

178
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:29,400
Abomination is stronger than the Hulk and smarter
than Savage Hulk, at least. And Bizarro is not as

179
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,160
powerful as a regular Superman. So I think
everything's going to kind of balance out in the

180
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:38,300
stats. I don't know if that's fair to say. I would
say he's as powerful as Superman, just not as

181
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:43,240
intelligent, unfortunately, in some
iterations. But yeah, these are essentially the

182
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:49,220
dark mirror counterparts of the heroes that they
battle against. They're both insanely strong and

183
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,740
I'm excited to see who's going to win this.
Abomination, of course, was the main antagonist

184
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:58,880
of the incredible Hulk film starring Edward
Norton and Emil Blonsky. The Abomination was

185
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,360
played by Tim Roth in that film. We've seen him
subsequently in some other projects like

186
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,340
Shang-Chi and The Legend of the Ten Rings and the
She-Hulk television series. And the jury is still

187
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:14,540
out as to whether or not the clone in the Superman
movie could be considered Bizarro. But the

188
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:19,220
character has been in live action shows like
Superman and Lois and Smallville, at least. So

189
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:23,060
we're going to find out who's going to win between
the two characters to explain the methodology

190
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:29,480
behind our duels. Let's go to our sentient dual
simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ and NK, tell our

191
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:35,760
listeners how you go about determining a winner in
our dual matchups. Yes, of course, sir. The way I

192
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,580
determine a winner between the contestants is by
running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations using the

193
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:45,440
characters statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation
is a probabilistic model used to determine

194
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,580
outcomes through random sampling. In this case, I
randomize the statistics along a normal

195
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,480
distribution as a way to simulate the many
variables that can occur during battle. The stat

196
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,600
parameters are based on the official Marvel power
grid from which the DC characters statistics are

197
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:06,040
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are
included such as range, damage potential,

198
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:11,140
versatility and perception in order to create a
more detailed and accurate simulation. The

199
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,860
results of the 1000 simulations provide a
percentage of wins for each character. The

200
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:19,660
contestant with the higher percentage is
declared the victor as they have a higher

201
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:24,700
probability to win any given battle. In an
equitable pairing, neither character should win

202
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:30,040
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat

203
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:34,500
Superman. So the confidence rate of my method
falls in line with the precedents that have been

204
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,360
established in the source material. My
mathematical simulations are without

205
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,940
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole
consideration, nor a fan votes tabulated for

206
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:49,160
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K.
Before we run the simulations, though, we'd like

207
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,420
to break down each character's histories and
abilities before improvising a scenario on how we

208
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:58,300
imagine one of the 1000 simulations would play out
beat for beat. And I believe it's my turn to start

209
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:04,240
off with the DC character. So let me tell you all
about Bizarro. The original Bizarro was created

210
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:10,080
during an experiment by Professor Dalton, a
visiting scientist at Smallville High School who

211
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,780
was demonstrating a duplication rate that he
invented. When the ray was accidentally fired at

212
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:22,660
Superboy, it produced a flawed, imperfect
duplicate. The duplicate had chalk white skin,

213
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:29,080
exaggerated features and distorted logic,
interpreting speech and morality in opposites.

214
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:34,640
Confused and unintentionally dangerous, this
Bizarro roamed Smallville, causing destruction

215
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,940
despite believing he was doing good. Ultimately,
he sacrificed himself to save a blind girl named

216
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:47,540
Melissa, whose sight was restored moments before
his death. Years later, a new Bizarro emerged when

217
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:53,860
Lex Luthor recreated the duplicator ray and used
it on Superman. This new Bizarro, possessing all

218
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:59,520
of Superman's powers, but twisted in mind and
morality, became obsessed with being Superman's

219
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:05,440
equal. Speaking in opposites and seeing heroism
through a backward lens, Bizarro caused chaos and

220
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,860
metropolis in his attempts to help. He eventually
created a Bizarro duplicate of Lois Lane and

221
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:17,040
traveled to a cube shaped Bizarro world that he
made known as Hitre, or Earth spelled backwards,

222
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:23,120
where everything operated under reversed logic.
He founded the Bizarro Justice League and ruled

223
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:29,760
Hitre with Bizarro Lois, enforcing nonsensical
laws and making everything imperfect or ugly.

224
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,200
Bizarro World would later be destroyed, however,
by an entity from the Phantom Zone named Aether.

225
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:41,740
Just before their world exploded, Bizarro and
Bizarro Lois placed their infant son into a rocket

226
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:48,340
ship that they blasted into the core of the planet,
ensuring he'd die first, before they and all the

227
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:53,500
other Bizarros were blown apart along with their
world. Following the crisis on Infinite Earth,

228
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:59,400
Bizarro's history was reimagined. In this
continuity, Lex Luthor again created Bizarro as a

229
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:06,360
clone of Superman using synthetic protoplasm and
Kryptonian DNA. The experiment was conducted in

230
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,660
secrecy and intended to produce a controllable
Superman duplicate. However, the cloning

231
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:17,960
process proved unstable. The resulting being was
malformed and mentally stunted with decaying

232
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:23,720
flesh and fragmented cognition. Luthor
dismissed the creature as a failure, but Bizarro

233
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:29,780
escaped containment and sought to fulfill what he
believed was his purpose, to become Superman.

234
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:35,260
This version of Bizarro tried to take over Clark
Kent's life, kidnapping Lois Lane and attempting

235
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:41,060
to win her affection. His warped sense of identity
and understanding of love put him at odds with the

236
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:45,580
real Superman, who tried to help him without
killing the misguided clone. Their battles

237
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:50,340
caused widespread destruction, but Bizarro
ultimately died protecting Lois from a

238
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:56,140
collapsing building, sacrificing himself in a
final moment of clarity. Later, Bizarro was

239
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:01,040
resurrected by Cadmus as part of a secret
government initiative to create a controllable

240
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:07,060
Superman. He returned as a more monstrous and
erratic figure with fluctuating levels of power

241
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:11,600
and cognitive deterioration. His presence
triggered multiple confrontations with

242
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,280
Superman and other heroes, including Superboy,
who saw Bizarro as a disturbing reflection of his

243
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:23,420
own cloned origin. Bizarro eventually joined the
Superman revenge squad alongside Mongol, Cyborg

244
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,980
Superman, Eradicator, and others. They launched
a coordinated assault on Superman with Bizarro

245
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:34,560
tasked with distracting or neutralizing him,
through brute force. During one of these battles,

246
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,840
Bizarro formed an uneasy bond with a mentally
unstable woman named Tracer, whose inverted

247
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:45,060
logic mirrored his own. Their relationship was
tragically cut short during an encounter with the

248
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:50,140
Justice League, which led to Bizarro's
incarceration. The original pre-crisis version

249
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:56,180
of Bizarro, known as Bizarro number one, was later
summoned by Alexander Luther Jr. to fight

250
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:01,880
Superman alongside other multiversal villains.
Though initially cooperative, Bizarro's

251
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,080
distorted reasoning led him to attack his allies
and enemies alike, proving too unpredictable

252
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:12,460
even for those who had recruited him. At various
points, Bizarro's condition worsened and his

253
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:18,780
body began to degrade as his cloned physiology
lacked long-term stability. He was housed in star

254
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:24,080
labs for observation, but repeatedly escaped,
leading to more erratic appearances and violent

255
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,680
clashes with Superman. Each time, he showed
flashes of conscience and even affection,

256
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:35,020
especially toward Lois Lane, but remained a
tragic and unstable figure. Following the

257
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:41,020
Flashpoint reset of DC continuity after multiple
attempts to clone Superman failed, Lex Luthor

258
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:47,420
created the first viable clone designated
B-Zero. Grown in a laboratory and accelerated

259
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:53,700
through artificial aging, the clone rapidly
matured but deteriorated just as quickly. Within

260
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:59,780
weeks, the imperfect cloning process produced a
bizarro-like creature with chalk white skin,

261
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:04,800
limited intellect, and reversed speech
patterns. Though initially kept hidden by

262
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,980
Luther, the creature broke free after exhibiting
unpredictable behavior and enormous

263
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:15,040
destructive capability. He went on a rampage
across Metropolis, drawing Superman's

264
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:20,560
attention. Unlike previous versions, this
bizarro displayed animalistic rage and had

265
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:25,920
trouble distinguishing a friend from foe. During
their confrontation, Superman recognized the

266
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:31,340
creature's suffering and sought to help it, even
as Bizarro's body began to break down.

267
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:36,780
Ultimately, the clone died in Superman's arms,
its final gesture being a backwards ass drawn on

268
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:41,900
Superman's chest with its own blood. Later, Lex
Luther recreated the project, this time

269
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:47,140
incorporating kryptonite into the cloning
process in an attempt to stabilize the genetic

270
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:53,680
template. The resulting bizarro was stronger,
more durable, and capable of primitive thought.

271
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:58,560
After a brief conflict with Superman, he was
ultimately taken into custody by the Justice

272
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:04,460
League and contained in a secure facility. This
version of bizarro was freed during a raid on the

273
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:10,080
facility by Black Manta, who inducted him into the
Seeker Society of Supervillains. He fought with

274
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,780
the villains against the Justice League, but was
eventually subdued. Lex Luther created yet

275
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:20,780
another bizarro Superman clone in a lab with
Geneticon Industries. Slated for termination,

276
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:27,520
this bizarro was instead purchased by Black Mask,
who intended to use the brute as muscle in Gotham.

277
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,860
While initially obedient, Bizarro's behavior
gradually shifted after he was paired with Red

278
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:39,100
Hood and Artemis on a mission for Black Mask. The
trio ultimately rebelled, forming their own team

279
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:44,100
known as the Outlaws. And you of course can learn
more about Black Mask and Red Hood and their

280
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,960
respective duels against Madame Mask and the
Punisher. Though slow-witted and frequently

281
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:54,820
confused, this bizarro showed increasing
emotional depth and self-awareness as Red Hood

282
00:26:54,820 --> 00:27:00,980
and Artemis treated him as an equal. Bizarro began
to see himself not as a failed clone, but as his own

283
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:07,000
person. After consuming books and classical
music and exposure to synthetic kryptonite,

284
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,420
Bizarro temporarily became a genius, even
constructing a floating base called the Bizarro

285
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:17,940
Sphere. His intelligence eventually began to
fade, but the friendship he formed with Jason Todd

286
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:23,720
and Artemis remained. During a mission to stop the
villains solitary, Bizarro sacrificed himself

287
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,480
to save his teammates, plummeting into an
alternate dimension. However, he later returned

288
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,320
alive, having survived through unexplained
means and rejoined the Outlaws. And that's his

289
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:40,180
history so far. Powers-wise, Bizarro possesses
many powers similar to Superman's, such as

290
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:46,720
immense strength, durability, flight, and super
speed. Though unlike Superman's heat vision,

291
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,900
Bizarro emits freeze vision from his eyes, and
instead of cold breath, he expels flames from his

292
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:58,900
mouth. His enhanced senses also function
somewhat unreliably. He has X-ray vision, for

293
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:05,720
example, but can only see through lead. He's weak
to blue kryptonite, but his greatest handicap is

294
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:17,880
his deteriorated mind and its interpretation of
the world around him. And that's Bizarro. Most of

295
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,400
the Bizarros, I would say, have more similarities
than differences, so I'm going with kind of a

296
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:29,180
generic composite Bizarro, and not any one in
particular. Not the angry one. Oh, the new 52 one?

297
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:34,080
Yeah, probably not that one. Bizarro shouldn't be
angry, in my opinion. He should just be kind of

298
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,020
confused and think he's always doing the right
thing when he's really not. Yeah, he would

299
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:43,300
probably object to this being a battle of villains
and see it more as him trying to stop the villain

300
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:48,740
that is Abomination. Yeah, totally. Bizarro does
not think of himself as a villain. Well, let me get

301
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:55,240
into Abomination's backstory. Emil Blonsky was
born in Zagreb, Yugoslavia, and worked as a spy and

302
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,620
KGB agent during the Cold War. A communist
loyalist, he was tasked with infiltrating the

303
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:06,500
United States Air Force Base in New Mexico,
commanded by General Thaddeus Thunderbolt Ross.

304
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:11,360
The base housed the research of nuclear physicist
Bruce Banner, whose experiments with gamma

305
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,360
radiation had already resulted in his
transformation into the Hulk, whom you can learn

306
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:21,940
more about in his duel against Doomsday. Ordered
to sabotage American military missiles, Blonsky

307
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:27,400
made several attempts but was repeatedly
thwarted, with his identity remaining unknown.

308
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,880
His mission escalated when he attempted to take
Ross's daughter, Betty, hostage, but he was

309
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:38,020
forced to retreat. Soon after, Banner attempted
to kill himself with a lethal gamut device, as the

310
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:43,430
Hulk was suffering under the control of the
enigmatic cosmic being known as the Stranger.

311
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:49,380
Blonsky, spying inside Banner's laboratory,
unknowingly exposed himself to the machine. The

312
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:54,640
concentrated radiation transformed him into a
monster larger and stronger than the Hulk. Betty

313
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:01,140
Ross, horrified, declared him an abomination,
the name that Blonsky embraced. Unlike Banner,

314
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:06,220
who could return to his human form, Blonsky was
permanently trapped in his mutated body.

315
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:11,510
Initially stronger than the Hulk at his baseline,
he also retained his full human intelligence.

316
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:16,400
Revealing in this power, Blonsky nearly killed
the Hulk in their first encounter and kidnapped

317
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:21,720
Betty Ross, prompting General Ross to work
alongside Banner to stop him. Banner used a gamma

318
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,320
weapon to weaken the abomination, though it only
halved his power before the Hulk destroyed the

319
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,780
device. The Stranger, impressed by the Hulk's
heroism and the abomination's strength,

320
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:37,920
transported Blonsky off-world to his laboratory
world, intending to use him as a pawn. On the

321
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:42,720
Stranger's world, the abomination remained
imprisoned until sorcerers on Earth summoned him

322
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,920
as a weapon against the Silver Surfer. Blonsky
rebelled, injuring his summoners, and battling

323
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:52,460
the Surfer before being returned to his cell.
Manipulating the Stranger's technology, he

324
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:57,380
transported Thor to the planet and tried to lead an
uprising among the captives, but Thor turned

325
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:02,780
against him and left him. Blonsky later escaped
the Stranger's cells and became first mate aboard

326
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:08,920
the Starship Andromeda, captained by Cybor, a
space pirate robot on the hunt for a colossal alien

327
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:14,900
monster called Kaatu on Earth. After arriving in
the planet's orbit, the starship came across

328
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:20,680
Bruce Banner. Blonsky and the Hulk fought
bitterly until their vessel clashed with Kaatu.

329
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:26,000
Both monsters plummeted back to Earth during the
battle, where Blonsky entered a coma upon impact

330
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,900
and remained buried for years until a missile test
revived him. Reservicing, the Abomination

331
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:37,140
allied with General Ross and clashed with the Hulk
repeatedly. He briefly teamed with another of

332
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:42,540
Hulk's foes, the Rhino, attempting to destroy
Hulk Buster Base with a gamma bomb. You can learn

333
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:47,360
more about the Rhino in his duel against Cheetah.
Their scheme was thwarted, and the Hulk forced the

334
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,560
villains into colliding with each other. Later,
Ross implanted what Blonsky believed was a bomb

335
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:57,900
into his skull to force him into obedience, but the
device was only a camera. The Abomination

336
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,720
manipulated the Hulk into helping him seize the
Kennedy Space Center, where he tried to ransom the

337
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,160
facility before being defeated again.
Attempting to escape in a rocket, Blonsky was

338
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:13,860
stranded in space. He was recovered by the Galaxy
Master, an immense energy being the enslaved

339
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:18,640
civilizations. Empowered with even greater
strength, the Abomination became the Galaxy

340
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:25,020
Master's enforcer, earning the name Ravager of
Worlds. When the Sagittarian Empress, Daedra,

341
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,940
recruited champions to stop him, they included
the Hulk, who battled Blonsky until his rage made

342
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,680
him stronger than the empowered Abomination. The
Galaxy Master withdrew the power it had granted

343
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:40,300
Blonsky, leaving him vulnerable to defeat. After
another stint stranded in space, Blonsky was

344
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:45,880
cryogenically contained on Earth under Ross's
orders. The villain Modak, seeking to control

345
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:50,420
Blonsky, mentally tortured and forced him into
battle against the Hulk. Despite his mental

346
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:55,680
coercion, Blonsky failed against the Hulk and
Modak disintegrated him. You can learn more about

347
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:00,660
Modak and his duel against Hector Hammond. The
villain Tyrannus, existing in a disembodied

348
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:06,860
state, merged his atoms with Blonsky's scattered
essence to restore a body. Initially, Blonsky

349
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:11,560
enjoyed a human form again while Tyrannus
controlled the Abomination's body. Eventually,

350
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:16,640
Blonsky's mind was returned to his mutated form,
though the transfer left him savage and merely

351
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,620
mindless. He fought Spider-Man and She-Hulk
across New York City until She-Hulk forced him to

352
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:27,180
retreat. Over time, his faculties returned and he
entered into an uneasy service with the leader,

353
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:32,060
another gamma-mutated enemy of the Hulk. During
one battle, the Hulk threw Blonsky into

354
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:37,060
irradiated waste, scarring his body
permanently. Disfigured and embittered,

355
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:41,020
Blonsky descended into the sewers of New York,
where he gathered a community of homeless

356
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:46,240
outcasts and mutants who came to view him as a
protector. Blonsky's life underground brought

357
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,600
him moments of purpose, but also tragedy, as
clashes with police led to the deaths of many under

358
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,360
his care. He encountered several heroes in this
period, including the Submariner and the mutant

359
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:01,700
Nate Gray, known as X-Man. He also crossed paths
with time travelers from a future ruled by the

360
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:06,460
Tyrant Hulk known as the Maestro, whom you can
learn more about in his duel with Kingdom Come

361
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:11,520
Superman. Though Blonsky sought solace in his
subterranean kingdom, his hatred of the Hulk

362
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,780
endured. That hatred reached its darkest
expression when Blonsky murdered Betty Ross,

363
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:22,060
Bruce Banner's wife. Consumed by envy of Banner's
marriage, he poisoned Betty through her dialysis

364
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:28,060
machine with his gamma-irradiated blood, making
it appear as if the Hulk was responsible. Betty's

365
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:32,639
father, General Ross, uncovered the truth, and
the abomination's crime shattered any illusions

366
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:38,150
of kinship he believed he shared with Banner. The
Hulk confronted him, but rather than killing him,

367
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:44,000
offered forgiveness. A response Blonsky could
not endure. Blonsky was eventually imprisoned,

368
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,900
forced to relive his lost humanity through
recordings of his past with his wife Nadia, who

369
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:54,340
believed he had died after his initial gamma
exposure. A shadow organization run by the leader

370
00:34:54,340 --> 00:35:00,340
later released him, manipulating both him and
Nadia into opposing roles. She sought vengeance

371
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:05,360
for her abuse during their marriage, while
Blonsky was promised a reunion. Their

372
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,640
confrontation ended in another battle with the
Hulk, who had befriended Nadia and again defeated

373
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,820
the abomination. During the Hulk's absence from
Earth while being sent away by a hero group known as

374
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:21,540
the Illuminati, Blonsky clashed with She-Hulk
and several Avengers. He was defeated and taken

375
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:26,700
into shield custody. Blonsky escaped, but his
life came to a brutal end when he encountered the

376
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:32,150
Red Hulk in Russia. You can learn more about the Red
Hulk in his duel against the General. Unaware that

377
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:37,780
this new Hulk was actually General Ross
transformed by gamma power, Blonsky was savagely

378
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:43,240
beaten and shot dead with a gamma powered gun. His
body did not rest, as he was resurrected by the

379
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:49,220
Shinto God of Evil known as the Chaos King during a
war among deities. The Chaos King empowered

380
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:54,380
Blonsky with new abilities to confront the Hulk
and his allies, and though he fought fiercely, he

381
00:35:54,380 --> 00:36:00,060
was destroyed once again when the embodiment of
death itself annihilated him. However, even this

382
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:05,320
was not his final chapter. An ancient secret
society recovered his remains, fusing them with

383
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:11,040
gamma tissue from the Hulk to create a mindless
abomination husk that they used as a weapon. This

384
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:15,650
creature was eventually launched into space by
the Avengers. Later, the covert program Shadow

385
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:21,300
Base retrieved and experimented with his corpse.
When its leader, General 14, merged with

386
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:27,200
abomination tissue, Blonsky was resurrected
with in 14's altered body. Now able to shift

387
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,720
between his traditional form and a new,
Lovecraftian form, he established Project

388
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,040
Greenspring, distributing gamma graphs through
a supplement called Fortify. His operation drew

389
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:44,460
the attention of Gamma Flight, a Hulk task force
who opposed Blonsky's efforts. More recently,

390
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:48,880
Blonsky was reverted to a standard form and joined
Mayor Kingpin's government-sponsored

391
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,980
Thunderbolts during Fisk's crackdown on
superheroes in New York. Alongside other

392
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:59,140
villains, he participated in missions such as
capturing the Purple Man's children. And that is

393
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:04,000
the abomination's backstory. Powers-wise,
Abomination has immensely enhanced physicality

394
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,900
derived from his gamma-irradiated physiology.
He's super strong, able to lift an excess of 100

395
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:15,570
tons, and is highly durable to the point of
invulnerability. Should he be injured, he has a

396
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:20,560
regenerative healing factor. He can run at
superhuman speeds and leap many miles in a single

397
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:26,570
bound. As a former spy for the Soviet Union, he is
skilled at espionage and his training enhanced to

398
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:33,060
hand combat. He's had quite the history. What does
his Lovecraftian version look like? Oh, that was

399
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:38,650
crazy. So it was like, you remember the Demigorgan
from Stranger Things Season 1? Yeah. It was like

400
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:44,150
that, but big and green. And Emile's face and
General Fourteen's face were like in the center of

401
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:49,980
that weird mouth face thing. Interesting. Yeah,
it was during the immortal Hulk run. That turned

402
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:55,400
into quite the Lovecraftian story in itself. That
sounds like an abomination, very fitting for his

403
00:37:55,400 --> 00:38:53,780
name. Yeah, yeah. But that's not the version
you're going with. Correct. All right then, well

404
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:58,400
now that we've got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one of the

405
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,600
1000 simulated matches will go. The winner is
determined by simulations, not the speculation,

406
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:10,520
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could play
out. AJ9K, what are the rules over speculation?

407
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,240
Well I should say there are no rules other than the
characters have no prior knowledge of the other

408
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,980
going into the fight. All they are aware of
starting out is that the other character is a

409
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,360
threat that needs to be eliminated. For the
speculation, the contestants will begin

410
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:29,740
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript
environment that will have no bearing on the match

411
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:34,650
itself, as no environmental statistics are
considered in my simulations. The contestants

412
00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:39,740
must earn victory on their own merit. All right
then, let's get into it. Bizarro and the

413
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:46,000
abomination meet on the battlefield. Who goes
first? Okay I'm gonna say Bizarro starts off just

414
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,100
by looking at abomination and right away he's
gonna be like, you am very handsome. We be bad

415
00:39:53,100 --> 00:40:00,260
enemies, no? This bad enemies mean best friends?
Yeah, good friends. Okay, okay. All right so

416
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:05,940
Bizarro's gonna fly over to shake abomination's
hand then and abomination's gonna grab and crush

417
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:11,320
his hand in his grasp and then just ragged all
slammer Bizarro into the ground repeatedly and

418
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,260
it's just gonna like smash up the ground all around
him, turning everything around him into like

419
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:22,200
gravel by like the size of boulders. Okay, Bizarro
gets ragdolled. That's not gonna hurt him too

420
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,610
much. He's probably actually just overjoyed
thinking that abomination wants to play with him

421
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:35,000
or something like that. He's like, oh me found bad
enemy. So Bizarro, he's gonna return the favor by

422
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,420
grabbing one of abomination's ankles with his
other hand as he's being slammed downward and he's

423
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:45,240
gonna fly abomination straight up into the air
before spinning really fast like a top and just

424
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:50,720
hurling abomination straight downward like a
comet right into the ground causing this massive

425
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,340
crater. Okay, if he throws him into the ground, the
impact is gonna launch all those broken boulder

426
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:01,940
pieces like up into the air and they're gonna fly up
and a few of them are gonna hit Bizarro on their way

427
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:06,760
up and as they fall back down, you know, it's
raining boulders all over the battlefield.

428
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:11,460
Bizarro is dodging them in the air and he's
wondering where his friend went and then all of a

429
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:18,060
sudden, abomination leaps up and puts Bizarro
into a headlock from behind and then just like pile

430
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:23,900
drives him back down into the ground creating, you
know, this even larger crater and resulting in

431
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:29,280
this just massive hail storm of boulders falling
from the sky again. Okay, by this point, Bizarro

432
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:35,180
assumes that the object of the game they're
playing is just to cause the other as much pain as

433
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:42,520
possible. So Bizarro, when he lifts his head out of
the ground, he's going to instantly blast

434
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:48,900
abomination with his flame breath just melting
his skin. Flame? Okay, I don't know how hot this

435
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:54,960
flame breath is. I guess it's as hot as heat vision,
right? Right. So that would hurt abomination for

436
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,020
sure. Maybe it might melt him a little bit, but he's
scaly, you know, he's somewhat armored, he's

437
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:05,320
durable. So the melting is going to be minor,
especially because abominations immediately

438
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:10,980
going to jam his fist down Bizarro's mouth, just
knocking out all his teeth and like his fist is

439
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:15,900
going to cork the flames. All right, well,
Bizarro, he's probably going to think that

440
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:23,400
abomination just wants his teeth or something
like that. So after using his super breath to spit

441
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:29,860
out abominations fist really fast from his mouth,
causing abomination to punch himself in the face,

442
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:35,560
Bizarro is going to follow up by spitting his teeth
out abomination like they were watermelon seeds,

443
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:41,240
but as fast as bullets. Bullets don't really hurt
abomination. These teeth are not going to hurt him

444
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:46,110
either. And abominations actually going to
thunderclap his hands together, which is going to

445
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:50,690
create this concussive shockwave, like a blast of
dynamite that's going to just rattle his already

446
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:55,280
rattled brain inside his skull. I mean, this
shockwave that he generates, that's just going to

447
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:03,070
make Bizarro happy. He's like enemy and clapping
for Bizarro. But then he's going to get sad right

448
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:09,860
away because he has no more teeth to give him. And so
he's going to start crying like really hard. And

449
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:14,560
that's going to trigger his freeze vision aimed
right at abomination. And that's going to freeze

450
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,760
him in place. And when Bizarro goes up to
abomination to give his friend a comforting hug,

451
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:25,610
he's going to squeeze him too tight. And that's
going to shatter abomination into little bits. So

452
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:29,900
match over. So he's going to squeeze his friend too
tight, shattering him to bits. I've seen

453
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:35,640
abomination get frozen once before, I think, by
like Iceman. But he like broke out of it

454
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:40,240
immediately because he's like so strong. And I
think because his body emits too much camera

455
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:47,820
radiation to even stay cool in ice. So as Bizarro
tries to bear hug abomination, abomination

456
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:53,800
breaks out of the ice, grabs Bizarro's head and
just turns it all the way around like Superman and

457
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,380
Man of Steel. That's odd. Well, I'm going to say,
even if the ice does a whole abomination, it holds

458
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:06,040
him long enough for Bizarro to use his super speed
to hug him. So Bizarro still wins. Well, let's

459
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:11,680
leave the match there and put in the stats. Either
Bizarro thinks abomination is his friend and bear

460
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:18,020
hugs him and shatters him while frozen or
abomination escapes the ice and pulls a man of

461
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:24,040
steel on the guy. We'll run the simulations and
find out who's going to come out as the winner. AJ9K

462
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:31,560
hit it. Inputting data, running calculations,
processing results, simulations complete. All

463
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,700
right, as I said before, when I was speculating on
who would win this fight, abomination definitely

464
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:41,740
came out ahead of Bizarro in terms of intelligence
and fighting skill, considering that Emil

465
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:48,120
Blonsky was trained as a KGB spy. That also said,
abomination didn't have a whole lot more going for

466
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:54,040
him compared to Bizarro. Yeah, Bizarro, we said,
is faster, has a greater range, has a higher

467
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:59,980
perception and higher versatility. Abomination
is essentially a one trick pony. He punches

468
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:04,420
things. Yeah, which makes him not that impressive
statistically. They need to give him something

469
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:09,140
like glowing radiation fists or something like
that, where he could shoot out gamma energy or

470
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:13,140
something. Yeah, that was an ability that Rick
Jones had. But yeah, they should give that to

471
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:18,120
abomination. Yeah, otherwise, abomination is
just like a not as good version of the Hulk, which I

472
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:22,420
guess you can make the same argument for Bizarro.
Well, I mean, abomination is stronger than the

473
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:26,440
Hulk, you know, base level Hulk. That's true.
Well, taking all of these stats into

474
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:31,800
consideration, Joseph, who do you think came out
on top? Wouldn't you like to know? That's why I'm

475
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:38,940
asking. It could be abomination, could not be.
Maybe just mind your business. And stop asking me

476
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:44,700
questions. We did ask our Instagram followers the
same question, and 72 percent of them think that

477
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:49,980
Bizarro is going to win. That is a lot. It's too
much, I think. How do you feel about that? I said,

478
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:57,020
stop asking me questions, didn't I? All right,
well, let's find out who won. AJ9K, the results,

479
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:05,300
please. Hey, you are, sir. The winner of the
matchup between Bizarro and Abomination is

480
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:14,900
Bizarro by a figure that's not too far off from our
Instagram poll. Out of 1000 simulated matches,

481
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:24,260
Bizarro won 717 or 71.7 percent of the time
compared to Abomination, who only won 28.3

482
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:31,900
percent of the time. Whose idea was this matchup?
Was it mine? I'm not sure, but it was a bad idea

483
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:37,360
whoever gave it. Maybe it was mine. I really
thought Abomination considering that, you know,

484
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:43,000
he's not slow and that he's super strong in a
trained KGB spy. I thought he'd have more going for

485
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:49,920
him statistically over this lame Superman clone.
But the whole Superman power set is just it's too

486
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:56,680
versatile. You know, he can do too many things.
He's too fast. He can control like fire and ice.

487
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:02,320
It's it's stupid. It's stupid. I'm going to say it
now. Superman's dumb character soar all of his

488
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:07,900
clones and all of his protégés. Just give the guy
all the powers, why don't you? It's nice to me like

489
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:14,140
someone is super jealous. I'm trying to remember
what my reaction was to the Kingdom Come Superman

490
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:19,920
versus Maestro fight, and I don't remember the
results of that specifically. But I do remember

491
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:25,080
that Superman won that one, and maybe I should have
took that as a lesson for what happens when you pit

492
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:31,220
Hulk against Superman. I mean, by this point, it
should be obvious. There's no way Hulk ever beat

493
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:36,420
Superman. Stop trying. Well, even according to
these stats, he beats him about a quarter of the

494
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:43,120
time. So you're not quite correct. That's pretty
damn correct, though. Like as far as our results

495
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:49,380
go, that's on the higher end. You're going to be on
the higher end when I swap out your brownies for

496
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:54,640
special brownies and then laugh at you as you trip
balls and freak out and get all paranoid and stuff.

497
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:00,040
I've never done that before, so I probably would
freak out. I've never done that before, so I

498
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:05,460
probably would freak out. Just wait, just wait
when you least expect it. I'm just glad I have a

499
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:11,560
recording to give to the police. That does it for
this episode, guys. Adjune and Katie help close

500
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:44,600
this out. Max destruction, Senjo world and
console combat. Our next episode is going to be

501
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:51,000
another dual episode this time between the
magical sword wielding characters of Amethyst on

502
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:57,680
DC and the Black Knight from Marvel. But that does
it for this episode. We want to give a big thanks to

503
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,800

make this podcast possible. We'll talk to you guys

507
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:23,560
next week. Up, up and away. True believers.
Jonathan never listens to my end sign offs.

508
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:28,740
Therefore, I shall take this opportunity to call
him a punk-ass bitch. I'm an AI. What is he going to

509
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:28,740
do?
