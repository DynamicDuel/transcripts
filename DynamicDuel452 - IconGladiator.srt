00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,560
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi, welcome to
the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,700
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,060
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin

4
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:44,260
brother, Marvelous Joe. And in this episode, we
are doing a duel between the Superman-esque

5
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:52,000
characters of Icon and Gladiator. Yeah, this was a
special request from our executive producers.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,040
I've always been a big fan of Gladiator, even
though he is a Superman knockoff, but just because

7
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,880
he's so heavily tied into the Shiar alien empire,
which is like one of the big races in the world of

8
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:09,360
cosmic Marvel. I guess you could more accurately
say that Gladiator is a Mon-El ripoff. And I have

9
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,600
too much respect for Icon to call him too much of a
Superman knockoff. So I know of Icon, but I

10
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,240
actually don't know his powers. Like both of these
guys are pretty obscured characters, I think,

11
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,280
both like cult followings. Yeah, we're going to
break down each character's histories and

12
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,260
abilities later on in this episode before finding
out who would win in a battle between the two.

13
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,520
Before that, we're going to break down the comic
book movie news from the past week, of which the

14
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:38,940
news is that there is no news. It's all just
freaking rumors all the time. I'm sick of it. I want

15
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:44,320
some real stuff. Yeah, enough with that like
clickbait speculation stuff. Like I want the

16
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,020
studios to like announce something already, you
know? Right. I want a Batman. I want something

17
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:55,540
besides Avengers Doomsday or Spider-Man, I
guess. I want something. Give me something. Give

18
00:01:55,540 --> 00:02:02,140
me anything. I think I have an old pizza crust in a
box upstairs if you want that. The fuck? Of course I

19
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,860
do. I love pizza crust. As always, guys, we list our
segment times in our episode description, so feel

the podcast. Guys, be sure to tune into the other
shows and the Diner Mike podcast network this

31
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:10,880
week, including the console combat podcast,
where hosts, John and Dean simulate battles

32
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,780
between popular video game characters. In
yesterday's episode, the two determined to win

33
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:21,460
between Wario, specifically the WarioWare
version, and Dr. Robotnik from Sonic the

34
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:26,320
Hedgehog. Over on the Max Destruction podcast,
hosts Scotty and Gilly pit your favorite action

35
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,600
heroes from film and television against each
other. On Wednesday, they're coming back from a

36
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,820
month long hiatus to find out who would win in a
fight between Chong Li from Bloodsport and Tong Po

37
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:42,540
from Kickboxer. This is going to be such a good
episode. On the Central World podcast, host

38
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,440
Zachary Hepburn speculates on fights between fan
favorite anime and manga characters. In his next

39
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:53,620
episode, Zach is going to reveal who would win
between Trafalgar D Waterlaw from One Piece and

40
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:59,500
Tanjiro Kanjiro from Bleach. Visit

00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:05,300
notes to listen to all of the shows in the Diner Mike
podcast network. But with that out of the way,

42
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:11,820
quick to the no prize. A no prize is an award that
Marble used to give out to fans. Our version, the

43
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:16,800
dynamic dual no prize is a digital award we post on
Instagram for the person that we feel gave the best

44
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,459
answer to our question of the week. Last week, we
asked you guys, what do you think Deadpool's

45
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:26,280
involvement in the Avengers Doomsday story will
be? And this is coming off of the news that Deadpool

46
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:32,060
will be an Avengers Doomsday, which has been
confirmed by The Hollywood Reporter and vaguely

47
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:36,340
by Ryan Reynolds own Instagram post. The
Hollywood Reporter said that the role would be

48
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,800
unsubstantial, but we thought we'd go to you guys
to see what that role might entail. We got three

49
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:47,660
answers, but actually one of them got lost.
Somewhere on the Internet. So sorry, Lorenzo

50
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:52,300
Valdez. Thank you for calling in. We saw that you
did leave a message, but for some reason it just

51
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,560
didn't load when we would click on it. So our
honorable mention goes to Alex Albro, who said,

52
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,320
Hey guys, I think Deadpool is a narrator of the
movie, the opening line being in a world where

53
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:09,200
fantasies collide and heroes clash. Wait, no,
that's not the right one. That's not the right

54
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,460
line. No, honestly, guys, I have no idea what
Deadpool is doing in this movie. I have no idea what

55
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,180
his role will be. Maybe it's just a post credit
cameo where he is at the end in a chair reading the

56
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,740
Secret Wars comic from Deadpool and Wolverine and
tells us to show up, you know, next December. I have

57
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:30,620
no idea. Actually, I wouldn't mind either of those
options if he's the narrator. Well, I guess it

58
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,140
would make the proceedings of the film seem a
little bit silly because of course he's going to

59
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,880
lend his own comedic commentary to what's going
on. So I like the second idea that Alex suggested

60
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,920
where he's like in a post credit scene kind of
telling people to show up for the continuation of

61
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:51,680
the story in Avengers Secret War. You know how Once
Upon a Deadpool was kind of based off of the

62
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,100
Princess Bride movie? Right. It was sort of like
this framed narrative where Deadpool's reading a

63
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:03,260
story to Fred Savage. I want Avengers Doomsday to
be a framed narrative based on the never ending

64
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:08,920
story because that's what these Marvel movies
are. Never ending stories. Yeah. So what does that

65
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,480
mean? Deadpool's like reading the Avengers
Doomsday story and then he like closes the book and

66
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:18,160
then runs out into a storm and shouts Dr. Doomsname
or something. And then all of a sudden he's writing

67
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:25,740
Dr. Dooms through the skies. That would be epic.
Great answer, Alex. But the winner of this week's

68
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:34,140
No Prize is Noah Terry. Who said? Hey, guys, so for
Deadpool's role in Avengers Doomsday, I would say

69
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:42,420
he will be almost like a multiverse guide to the
Avengers and other characters, almost like a

70
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:48,600
chaotic version of Nick Fury who will introduce
the incursions in the TVA to the characters and

71
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:54,280
help drive the story forward. So that's my answer.
Thanks. Bye, guys. I actually think this one's

72
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,560
plausible in that we know with Loki sitting on his
throne, you know, taking care of the multiverse

73
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:05,220
and substituting for the loom and Mobius, Owen
Wilson's character from the Loki show no longer at

74
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:10,500
the TVA. They got to have some kind of TVA
representative in Avengers Doomsday. So maybe

75
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,460
Deadpool serves as the like the TVA
representative and introducing the concept of

76
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:20,840
the incursions to the Avengers. And I like that
answer a lot because how many characters from the

77
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,280
films are actually familiar with the concept of
the multiverse? I mean, there's Dr. Strange and

78
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:33,000
there's Spider-Man. And I guess like Captain
America was told about them in the post-credits

79
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,840
scene for Captain America Brave New World, I guess
possibly Ant-Man too, with his involvement with

80
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,640
King. And of course, the Fantastic Four would know
about them having come from a separate universe.

81
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,640
So a lot of them, actually. But, you know, they may
not all know about the incursions themselves. I

82
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,640
think that's just the Dr. Strange thing. But I
think this would be a fun idea to be like a quick way

83
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,280
for Deadpool to like get in and out of the story,
just kind of like setting up what these guys got to

84
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,440
do and how the TVA needs them. So great answer,
Noah, and congrats on winning this week's No

85
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,360
Prize. If you, the listener, want to shout out
winning your own No Prize, stay tuned to later on

86
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,100
this episode when we'll be asking another
question of the week. And since there is no news

87
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:18,980
this week, on to the question of the week. All
right, guys, it's fantasy football season. So we

88
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,380
thought we would ask you guys a fantasy football
related question that pertains to Marvel and DC.

89
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:28,960
Basically, who would be your number one
quarterback, running back, wide receiver, tight

90
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,580
end, safety and kicker on your Marvel or DC fantasy
football team? So taking all the superhero

91
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:39,520
characters out there from Marvel and DC, putting
them on a football team, what would those primary

92
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:45,340
positions be? Again, quarterback, running back,
wide receiver, tight end, safety and kicker. And I

93
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:51,020
don't want to see any of these mixing of Marvel and
DC characters on these teams. This is either team

94
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:56,720
DC or team Marvel. You get a pick. Yeah, and give us
the name of your team, too. Record your answer at

98
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,040
favorite answer and award that person a Dynamic
Duel No Prize that will post to Instagram. Be sure

99
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:29,740
to answer before September 6th. But now let's move
on to the main event of this episode, a duel between

100
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:52,480
the DC milestone character of Icon and Marvel's
leader of the Imperial Guard Gladiator. OK, Icon

101
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:59,580
versus Gladiator, as we mentioned earlier, these
are two Superman-esque characters who can fly and

102
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,860
are super strong and shoot lasers. But I think they
also have interesting stories. At least I know

103
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:12,520
Icon does. He, of course, originated in milestone
comics, which was later acquired by DC Comics.

104
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:18,640
Yeah, I like Gladiator's backstory. You know, for
all these Superman copies, essentially, a lot of

105
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,920
them have managed to kind of carve out their own
unique and interesting backstory. For the most

106
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,860
part, I mean, except for Hyperion, right, the
leader of the Squadron Supreme. We actually have

107
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:33,560
done a duel with him against Ultraman. We've also
done a duel with the Sentry against Zod. So this

108
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:38,520
will be like our fourth version of like Superman
versus Superman-esque characters. To my

109
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,560
knowledge, neither of these characters have been
in film, but I know that they have made appearances

110
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:50,500
in both the X-Men and the Young Justice animated
series. Right. Yeah, the X-Men live action films

111
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:57,000
have yet to really go cosmic. Yet there is a cosmic
side to the X-Men comic books, which largely deals

112
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,840
with the Shiar. I guess it would be strange for the
live action X-Men films to really go out there like

113
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:08,880
that. Although, I guess the Dark Phoenix movie did
have the Dabari aliens as villains. Who were not

114
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,860
the Skrulls. Right. But going from there, I think
you could branch out into, you know, the Shiar and

115
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:19,480
the Imperial Guard in a subsequent X-Men movie.
You know, if that whole Fox X-Men universe wasn't

116
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,360
obsolete by this point. I do think a icon movie
would be cool as hell, though. It would be like

117
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:29,060
Django and Chained meets Superman. I mean, they
could go that route. I think that's definitely a

118
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:34,520
route you could take the film. I think that would be
awesome. We would really need a series of films, I

119
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:40,300
think, maybe a trilogy to really tell Icahn's full
story. Well, let's get into those backstories.

120
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,220
First, to explain the methodology behind our
duels, let's go to our sentient dual simulator,

121
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,300
Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K tell our listeners how
you go about determining a winner in our dual

122
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,960
matchups. Yes, of course, sir. The way I determine
a winner between the contestants is by running one

123
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,900
thousand Monte Carlo simulations using the
characters statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation

124
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:05,440
is a probabilistic model used to determine
outcomes through random sampling. In this case, I

125
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,600
randomize the statistics along a normal
distribution as a way to simulate the many

126
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,540
variables that can occur during battle. The stat
parameters are based on the official Marvel power

127
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:19,840
grid from which the DC characters statistics are
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are

128
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,340
included such as range, damage potential,
versatility and perception in order to create a

129
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:30,300
more detailed and accurate simulation. The
results of the 1000 simulations provide a

130
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,260
percentage of wins for each character. The
contestant with the higher percentage is

131
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:39,100
declared the victor as they have a higher
probability to win any given battle. In an

132
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,520
equitable pairing, neither character should win
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have

133
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,360
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat
Superman. So the confidence rate of my method

134
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,440
falls in line with the precedents that have been
established in the source material. My

135
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,920
mathematical simulations are without
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole

136
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:04,400
consideration, nor a fan vote is tabulated for
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K.

137
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,860
Before we run the simulations, though, we'd like
to break down each character's histories and

138
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,940
abilities before improvising a scenario on how we
imagine one of the 1000 simulations would play out

139
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:18,460
beat for beat. And it is my turn to go first with the
Marvel characters backstory. So let me tell you

140
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:28,820
all about Gladiator, whose real name is Clark. Yo,
what? Not Clark. Calark. Wow. K-A-L-L-A-R-K, if

141
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:34,960
you care. Calark was born centuries ago on the
planet Strontia under the dominion of the Shiar

142
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:41,080
Empire. He was descended from a proud lineage and
raised by the Strontian Council of Elders, who are

143
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:46,540
as much as family as his blood relatives. Like all
Strontians, he possessed the potential for great

144
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:52,740
power, but his abilities depended on his complete
devotion to purpose. As a youth, he trained as a

145
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,800
military cadet competing for the title of
Gladiator. He distinguished himself as both an

146
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,820
honorable individual and a formidable soldier.
Only 10 cadets survived the harsh training

147
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:07,820
trials, and they were subjected to a dangerous
enhancement process that granted them powers far

148
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:13,120
beyond the norm of their race. The Council of
Elders informed the cadets that the purpose of

149
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,340
their trials was to select from among them the
finest warrior of the Strontian race, as the

150
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:23,560
planet Strontia was under Shiar rule. The Shiar
were an alien race with a vast intergalactic

151
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:28,960
empire who demanded that the strongest of each of
its subjects serve in its imperial guard and

152
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:34,800
protect the Shiar ruler, known as a Majestor.
Calark and the other cadets were to be tested by the

153
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:40,220
Majestor to core, who, knowing that even an
ordinary Strontian could devastate an army,

154
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:45,500
demanded that they prove their loyalty and
absolute obedience to the empire by ordering the

155
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:51,880
cadets to slay the Strontian Council of Elders.
Most of them refused and died trying to rebel,

156
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,960
leaving only Calark committed enough to fulfill
the order and he killed the council that were once

157
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:03,260
like family to him. For his loyalty, Majestor to
core dubbed Calark as Gladiator, and he was given

158
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:08,800
the rank of Praetor of the Imperial Guard, a
leadership position he would hold for centuries.

159
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:14,460
As the Praetor of the Imperial Guard, Gladiator
served multiple Majestors leading up to D'Kenn, a

160
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,920
power-hungry ruler who craved the Macron crystal
which housed enough energy to destroy an entire

161
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:26,380
universe. D'Kenn's sister, L'Londra, reached
out to the X-Men on Earth, aware of their existence

162
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:32,160
due to their defeat of the invading alien race
called the Xenox. Professor X and his team of

163
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,400
mutants were transported into space where D'Kenn
declared L'Londra a traitor and commanded

164
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:42,520
Gladiator and the Imperial Guard into battle with
the X-Men. You can learn more about the X-Men in

165
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:47,040
their duel against the Titans. L'Londra
eventually convinced Gladiator to stand down

166
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,900
when D'Kenn was rendered catatonic, driven
insane through his contact with the Macron

167
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:57,740
crystal. She laid claim to the Xiar throne,
becoming its new Majestrix, and Gladiator's new

168
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:03,600
charge. He shifted his loyalty to L'Londra and
stood at her side when the Dark Phoenix arose, a

169
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,340
threat the Majestrix equated to Galactus.
Declaring that Jean Grey's possession by the

170
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:13,180
Phoenix could not be allowed to continue,
L'Londra commanded Gladiator to represent her in

171
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:18,540
an honor duel against the X-Men on the blue area of
the moon. Gladiator battled Colossus and

172
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:23,360
overpowered him with ease, surviving the
collapse of ancient Cree ruins without injury.

173
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,960
Yet even Gladiator and the Guard were powerless
against the Dark Phoenix, who defeated them

174
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,980
before ultimately taking her own life. You can
learn more about Jean Grey and the Phoenix Horse in

175
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:38,660
our Raven vs Phoenix duel episode. In later years,
Gladiator remained a stalwart protector of

176
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:43,540
L'Londra. He opposed Lord Samadhar when the
counselor betrayed the throne in alliance with

177
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:48,760
Deathbird, L'Londra's sadistic sister. He also
traveled to Earth mistakenly believing the

178
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:53,060
Fantastic Four were scrolls in disguise and
clashed with them before Spider-Man and Captain

179
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:58,860
America helped expose the true imposters. When
Deathbird usurped the Xiar throne and took the

180
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:04,420
title of Majestrix, Gladiator was forced to serve
her despite his loyalties lying with L'Londra.

181
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:09,579
During Deathbird's rule, he and the Guard fought
with the Starjammers, a group of space pirates who

182
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:14,819
had allied with L'Londra over the power of the
Phoenix Force. He was defeated and Deathbird

183
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:19,680
later lost her throne after a group of alien
scrolls staged a coup in order to reinstate

184
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:25,220
L'Londra as Majestrix and have her be in the
scrolls' thrall. Gladiator continued to enforce

185
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:30,700
Xiar will, but his path often intersected with
Earth's heroes. He clashed with the Avengers and

186
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:35,320
fought Thor, suffering defeat during the
Xiar-Cree War. When Earth's heroes sacrificed

187
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,900
themselves against Onslaught, L'Londra sent
Gladiator and the Guard to safeguard Earth, where

188
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:46,360
they uncovered a Cree extremist plot. He later
battled the Hulk while pursuing a Xiar fugitive on

189
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,500
Earth, thwarted Ronan the Accuser's
assassination attempt on L'Londra, which you can

190
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:55,580
learn more about in our recent Inhumans duel, and
led an assault on the X-Men under Majestrix

191
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:01,300
L'Londra's orders, but learned that she was under
Cassandra Nova's psychic control. You can learn

192
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:07,220
more about Professor X's sister in our Chief vs
Professor X duel. Gladiator's duties extended to

193
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,660
cosmic threats. He was captured by a herald of
Galactus named Tyrant alongside heroes like Beta

194
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:17,500
Ray Bill and the Silver Surfer, though Galactus
eventually freed them. Gladiator infiltrated

195
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:22,620
the Kiln Prison with Thanos and Star-Lord,
discovering an Amnesiac godlike being known as

196
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,560
the Beyonder. He challenged the Champion of the
Universe on planet Skardon, though the

197
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:33,160
Champion's power gem made victory impossible for
Gladiator. He also pursued the Unipower, which is

198
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,580
an energy that emanates from the Enigma Force and
transforms its host into the hero Captain

199
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:43,060
Universe. He teamed up with the Silver Surfer to
stop a space warlord named Krosakis, who had

200
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:47,980
acquired the Unipower energy. Meanwhile,
Vulcan, the lost brother of Cyclops who was

201
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:53,420
separated from his family years ago by Daken's
actions, plotted revenge against Daken. Vulcan

202
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:58,660
secretly pulled Daken out of his coma, who then
took back his rightful title of Majester from his

203
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:04,580
sister, Lalandra. Vulcan then killed Daken and
claimed the Shiar throne by right of conquest,

204
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:10,140
marrying Deathbird and becoming the new charge of
Gladiator and the Imperial Guard. Vulcan's reign

205
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:15,840
embroiled the Shiar in war against the Kree, and
Gladiator eventually defied Vulcan by refusing

206
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,920
to execute Lalandra. However, he soon witnessed
Darkhawk, a rogue member of an ancient sect of

207
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:27,220
Shiar assassins, kill Lalandra. An act you can
learn more about in our Stargirl vs. Darkhawk dual

208
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:32,900
episode. When Vulcan was presumed dead in a battle
against Black Bolt, Gladiator himself assumed

209
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:39,480
leadership of the Shiar to prevent civil war,
becoming the Empire's new Majestor. As ruler,

210
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:44,360
Gladiator faced crises across the galaxy. He
joined a team of cosmic heroes called the

211
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,920
Annihilators, alongside Silver Surfer, Beta Ray
Bill, Quasar, and Ronin, defending against

212
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,580
threats like the Diarrates and the Magus. During
the Phoenix's return to Earth, Gladiator

213
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:59,660
attempted to stop the Phoenix V and rescue his son,
Kubar. Around that time, he recruited the first

214
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:05,720
human into the Imperial Guard's ranks, a woman
named Isabel Kane, aka Spasher, who had

215
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:11,820
discovered special goggles called Exospex that
she could use to download any ability of someone in

216
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:16,380
her view. Gladiator and the Shiar Empire fought
alongside the Avengers and Guardians of the

217
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:21,420
Galaxy against cosmic threats like the
Cancerverse and Thanos, but Gladiator grew sick

218
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:26,340
of his duties over time, wishing instead to return
to his title of Praetor of the Imperial Guard.

219
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:32,620
Supporting his demotion was Deathbird, who saw
Astrantian ruling the Shiar Empire as an insult.

220
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:37,980
Shiar rebels used genetic material from
Lillandra's body and Professor X to create a child

221
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:43,120
named Zandra. When a society of artificial
intelligence threatened the Shiar, Gladiator

222
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,200
abdicated his throne and installed Zandra as the
new Magestrix, though he continued to advise and

223
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,740
protect the child. He also cooperated with
Imminent Nation Krakowa, permitting a gateway to

224
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:59,960
be established between the island and Shandalar,
the Shiar throne world. That's Gladiator's

225
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,140
backstory. Powers-wise, Gladiator has numerous
abilities derived from a scientifically

226
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:10,440
enhanced strontian physiology. He is immensely
strong, able to lift over 100 tons with ease, and is

227
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,620
virtually invulnerable to physical damage. He
can move and fly at orbital speeds of thousands of

228
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:21,120
miles per hour and can emit beams of heat energy
from his eyes that are as hot as the sun. Gladiator

229
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,140
can also expel powerful and freezing gusts of wind
from his lungs and has enhanced senses of hearing

230
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:32,620
and sight. He has been trained in Shiar martial
arts and military strategy since he was young. His

231
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:37,840
power level is dependent on his confidence, so
elapsed and self-assurance in his actions will

232
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,060
weaken him. He's also susceptible to magic and
nuclear radiation. That's Gladiator. You know,

233
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:49,780
Gladiator's origin wasn't as close to Superman's
as I thought it would be, although his power set is

234
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:55,800
very much exactly like Superman's. Icon's origin
is pretty close to Superman, I would say.

235
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,660
Interesting, okay. Yeah, I'm glad that we were
able to get to a duel with Gladiator because the

236
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:47,470
history of the Imperial Guard really is the
history Icon, let me get into his backstory.

237
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:53,830
Thousands of years ago, an alien negotiator from
the planet Terminus named Arnis traveled the

238
00:22:53,830 --> 00:23:00,610
stars aboard a life pod designed to terraform new
worlds. When the pod malfunctioned, it crashed on

239
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:07,290
Earth in the year 1839 in the American South. As
part of its survival protocol, the pod's

240
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:13,670
automorphic technology reconstructed Arnis'
body into the form of the first sentient life it

241
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:19,470
encountered, a black woman named Miriam, who was
enslaved on a cotton plantation. The

242
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:25,790
transformation not only altered his DNA, but also
reset his cognition, turning him into a human

243
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:31,410
infant with no memory of his extraterrestrial
identity. Miriam discovered the child near the

244
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:36,750
crash site and with no knowledge of his origin,
raised him as her own within the enslaved

245
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:43,110
community, naming him Augustus. Growing up in
bondage, Augustus experienced the brutal

246
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:49,210
realities of slavery first hand. As he matured,
his intellect rapidly advanced beyond human

247
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:55,830
limits and with it came flashes of memory and
gradual rediscovery of his true alien nature. He

248
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:01,470
eventually escaped enslavement, joined the
Union Army during the Civil War, and used his

249
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:07,630
powers covertly to help sway key battles in favor
of the North. In the decades that followed, he

250
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:12,910
continued to live under assumed identities,
posing as successive descendants of Augustus

251
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:19,990
Freeman I while acquiring wealth, education, and
influence. By the time of World War II, he once

252
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:25,070
again took part in pivotal moments of history,
using his abilities discreetly to shape the

253
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:30,510
outcome of global events. By the late 20th
century, Augustus Freeman IV lived as a

254
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:36,270
successful corporate attorney in Dakota City,
having grown distant from humanity and resigned

255
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:42,490
to observing rather than intervening. His long
life had convinced him that lasting societal

256
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:48,530
change was unlikely, a belief that was challenged
when his home was broken into by a group of troubled

257
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:54,710
teenagers. Among them was Raquel Irvin, a young,
idealistic writer from the impoverished Paris

258
00:24:54,710 --> 00:25:00,550
Island neighborhood. After witnessing Augustus
use his powers to subdue the intruders, Raquel

259
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:05,790
confronted him with the idea that he could be a
real-life superhero, someone who could inspire

260
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:11,830
change and justice. Though reluctant at first,
Augustus was persuaded by Raquel's conviction

261
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:17,830
and agreed to become a hero under the name Icon,
with Raquel designing his costume and

262
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:23,690
accompanying him as his sidekick Rocket, who you
can learn more about in our Rocket vs. Spider-Gwen

263
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:30,990
dual episode. As Icon, Augustus became a powerful
symbol of hope and lawfulness in Dakota City. He

264
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:35,450
betrothed neighborhoods affected by crime and
corruption, while Rocket helped balance his

265
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:41,130
rigid moral code with compassion and
contemporary social awareness. While Icon often

266
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:45,930
approached problems through a conservative and
lawful lens, Rocket challenged him to see

267
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:51,070
injustices embedded within the systems he sought
to uphold. Their ideological debates

268
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:56,750
strengthened their bond, making them one of the
most effective hero duos in the city. Their

269
00:25:56,750 --> 00:26:01,030
presence soon brought them into contact and
sometimes conflict with other super-powered

270
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:06,190
individuals. Rocket and Icon worked alongside
the vigilantees' static and encountered the

271
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:11,670
inventor known as Hardware, another gifted
genius with ties to corporate conspiracy. You can

272
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:17,350
learn more about static in our Static vs. Jubilee
episode. Eventually, Icon joined other powered

273
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:23,330
individuals to form the Shadow Cabinet, a covert
team assembled to safeguard global stability and

274
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:28,210
prevent superhuman threats from spiraling out of
control. Though initially at odds with the

275
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:33,570
cabinet's secrecy and morally gray tactics, Icon
agreed to join under the condition that their

276
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:39,870
mission remained focused on preserving peace and
liberty. In the public eye, Icon was hailed as a new

277
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:44,490
protector for the marginalized. However, his
presence also attracted the attention of alien

278
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:49,890
horses from his past. The terminating species had
long believed him to be lost and his mission a

279
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:55,510
failure. When they detected his survival, they
dispatched the powerful bounty hunter Oblivion

280
00:26:55,510 --> 00:27:01,310
to retrieve or eliminate him. The confrontation
devastated parts of Dakota City and threatened to

281
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:06,550
reveal Augustus' extraterrestrial origin to the
world. With Rocket's help, Icon defeated

282
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:13,010
Oblivion and reaffirmed his commitment to Earth
as his true home. As Rocket matured, she faced her

283
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:17,310
own challenges including an unexpected
pregnancy that forced her to take time away from

284
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:22,850
crime fighting. Icon continued his mission alone
for a time, during which she became more directly

285
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:29,050
involved in legal reform and rehabilitation of
young offenders. Upon Rocket's return, the two

286
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:34,470
resumed their partnership. When a cosmic crisis
threatened the multiverse, Icon was identified

287
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:39,870
as one of the most powerful beings in his reality
and was drawn into conflicts that extended beyond

288
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:44,930
his dimension. He helped repel interdimensional
threats and fought to protect the balance between

289
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:50,950
worlds. Though these battles exposed him to other
versions of reality, he remained grounded in his

290
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:56,810
adopted identity and mission on his Earth.
Following DC's Flashpoint event, reality was

291
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:02,670
rewritten and Dakota City's history was altered.
In this new continuity, Augustus Freeman

292
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:08,490
remained an alien from Terminus who crash-landed
on Earth in the 19th century. He maintained a low

293
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:14,270
profile, allowing human societies to develop
independently while observing from a distance.

294
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:19,690
In the modern era, he continued to work as a lawyer
in Dakota City, maintaining a private life and

295
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:24,870
avoiding engagement with the growing number of
metahumans. The widespread event known as the Big

296
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:30,390
Bang changed that. During a violent clash between
police and gang members on Paris Island, an

297
00:28:30,390 --> 00:28:36,130
experimental mutagenic gas developed by all the
industries detonated, killing many and mutating

298
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:41,710
others into super-powered beings. The
survivors, known as Bang Babies, created a surge

299
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:47,090
in crime, chaos, and metahuman activity
throughout Dakota City. Among the witnesses to

300
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:51,990
the event was Raquel Urban, whose home and
community were directly affected. Seeking

301
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:56,710
justice and driven by hope, Raquel tracked down
Augustus Freeman after hearing rumors about his

302
00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:01,210
strength and longevity. Once again, she
challenged him to become a symbol for those who

303
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:07,510
felt abandoned and powerless. Inspired by her
resolve, Augustus adopted the icon identity Anu,

304
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:12,230
with Raquel becoming Rocket once more. Their
partnership emerged as a stabilizing force

305
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:17,310
during the chaos of the Big Bang aftermath.
Together, Icon and Rocket battled Bang Babies who

306
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:22,130
used their powers for violence, as well as corrupt
political forces that sought to exploit the

307
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:26,830
crisis for their personal gain. Rocket became
increasingly vocal about issues of social

308
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:32,550
inequality, helping Icon refine his approach to
heroism. Their work led to the formation of new

309
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:38,710
alliances with local heroes, community leaders,
and civil rights advocates. When the government

310
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:44,190
attempted to establish a paramilitary task force
to control metahuman populations, Icon

311
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:50,410
resisted, warning against the misuse of power.
His stand put him at odds with federal agencies and

312
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:55,670
even some of his fellow heroes, but he remained
steadfast in his belief that individual liberty

313
00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:01,770
and accountability were paramount. As threats
escalated both in scale and complexity, Icon was

314
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:07,330
forced to confront remnants of his past. A rogue,
terminan scientist attempted to weaponize

315
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:12,960
Earth's metahumans as part of a plan to terraform
the planet or terminus colonization. But to help

316
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,420
of Rocket and other Dakota-based heroes, Icon
dismantled the operation, reaffirming his

317
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:24,180
loyalty to Earth and the people he now considered
his true kin. And that's Icon's history.

318
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:30,240
Powers-wise, Icon possesses vast superhuman
abilities derived from his alien physiology as a

319
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:35,100
terminan. His strength allows him to lift immense
weights, while his durability makes him

320
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:40,900
resilient to bullets, extreme temperatures,
explosions, and even direct energy assaults. He

321
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:46,500
can fly at high velocities and is capable of
interstellar travel. His longevity grants him

322
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:53,360
near immortality, having aged only marginally
since his arrival on Earth over a century ago. He

323
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:59,520
also has enhanced senses and is a trained soldier
having fought in multiple wars. He can manipulate

324
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:05,060
positronic energy for a variety of effects,
including focused energy blasts from his hands

325
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:11,500
and eyes, or waves of energy from any part of his
body. This energy also allows him to accelerate

326
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:17,520
his healing, generate force fields, and emit
electromagnetic pulses, even capable of

327
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,940
disrupting electric signals in the human body. He
has a genius level intellect and has accumulated

328
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:28,660
vast legal, historical, and scientific
knowledge over his long life. His experience

329
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:33,680
across different cultural and historical eras
also makes him a tactician and leader with deep

330
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:40,840
insight into the nature of humanity. OK, so Icon's
backstory is a lot more similar to Superman's in

331
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:46,580
that he is like an alien who comes to Earth, but his
power set is a lot different from Superman's, I

332
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:50,700
feel like. Yeah, yeah. I mean, he doesn't have like
freeze breath or anything like that, but you know,

333
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,920
he still has the enhanced senses, still has the
super strength and durability and can fly. Yeah,

334
00:31:55,920 --> 00:32:00,820
gladiators powers mimic Superman's down to like
even the weakness to radiation and the freeze

335
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:08,080
breath and everything like that. Oh, actually,
Icon is weak to a specific unnamed alien mineral.

336
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,720
Oh, I know what that mineral is. OK, what is it? What
do you like to know? I'll let you know during the

337
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:24,940
speculation, of course. In a world where
fantasies collide and heroes clash, one podcast

of mathematical simulations discover who will

344
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:10,660
where we settle the debate and settle the score.
Well, now that we've got their histories and

345
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:15,800
abilities out of the way, let's speculate on how
one of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The

346
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:21,060
winner is determined by simulations, not the
speculation, but it's fun to imagine how this

347
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:27,460
fight could play out. AJ9K, what are the rules of
our speculation? Well, I should say there are no

348
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:32,460
rules other than the characters have no prior
knowledge of the other going into the fight. All

349
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:37,560
they are aware of starting out is that the other
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.

350
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:42,760
For the speculation, the contestants will begin
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript

351
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:47,840
environment that will have no bearing on the match
itself, as no environmental statistics are

352
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,020
considered in my simulations. The contestants
must earn victory on their own merit. All right,

353
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:58,660
then let's get into it. Icon and Gladiator meet on
the battlefield. Who goes first? I think as

354
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:03,300
Praetor of the Imperial Guard, Gladiator is going
to go first because he's more like battle hardened

355
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:09,679
than Icon, I think. So he's going to start off by
blasting beams that are as hot as the sun from his

356
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:16,260
eyeballs that just melt through Icon skull. No,
because Icon, he could just counter with his own I

357
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:23,739
beams of positronic energy. So those beams are
going to collide and this ball of energy is going to

358
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:29,620
form in the middle and explode. That's going to
send both characters careening from each other.

359
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:37,239
But Icon right after is going to charge Gladiator
and just bombard him with waves of energy before

360
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:42,040
crashing directly into him. Well, if Icon is
charging at Gladiator, Gladiator is going to

361
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:47,960
charge right back and he's going to pierce through
whatever energy waves Icon is throwing at him,

362
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:53,500
piercing through them like a spear. And he just
clashes with Icon head on. And the force of that

363
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:58,020
impact would probably like rupture a crater in the
grounds beneath him, but the ground doesn't

364
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:03,720
matter anymore because I think Gladiator is just
going to grapple Icon as they collide and then

365
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,460
shoot him into the sky into space and within just
like seconds, just throw him into the heart of the

366
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:14,700
sun where Icon burns life. OK, but as they're
traveling through space, Icon, you know, he'll

367
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:20,560
just free himself from Gladiator's grasp by
walloping cam right in the jaw with a charged

368
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:26,020
energy fist that's going to send Gladiator flying
through space, probably through a couple

369
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:31,720
asteroids, just smashing them into pebbles with
the impact. With the vastness of space, I wonder

370
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:39,040
what the odds are the icon would smash Gladiator
into asteroids. Gladiator flew that far.

371
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,480
Murphy's Law. Exactly. Well, Gladiator picks up
one of these asteroids, probably like in the

372
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,440
asteroid belt or whatever. We'll say that this
asteroid is like the size of Texas, right? Like the

373
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,020
movie Armageddon. And he grabs this asteroid and
he's just full on brains icon with it, smashing it

374
00:35:55,020 --> 00:36:01,500
over his head. OK, but we'll say that as Gladiator
is swinging this giant sized asteroid, Icon is

375
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,500
going to blind him with a quick strobe of energy
from his hands. And that's going to cause

376
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:12,900
Gladiator to completely miss this swing. And
while he's off balance, Icon is going to grab

377
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:19,580
Gladiator by his mohawk and just smash his face
right into the asteroid that he's holding. So hard

378
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:24,140
and so fast that it's going to crack the asteroid
right in half. The whole asteroid, like the whole

379
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:30,400
state of Texas is going to crack in half. That whole
asteroid has a crack. I feel like Gladiator would

380
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:37,080
have a headache from that kind of hit. So he's like
dazed right from the strobe light and from the head

381
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:42,760
injury he just suffered. So he's going to spin like
a whirlwind with his fists just straight out, just

382
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:49,060
knocking away anything that even comes close to
him. And like a blur, he punches Icon like a million

383
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:55,160
and one times in the face. So now both characters
have headaches. Except that Icon can heal

384
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:02,380
rapidly. So while Gladiator Gladiator can also
heal rapidly. OK, fine. He's dizzy then. All

385
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:08,100
right. So when Gladiator stops spinning and he's
like trying to recover, like, whoa, that's when

386
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:13,800
Icon is going to blast him with beams of concussive
energy from his hands, targeting him right in the

387
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,640
balls and is showing any hope for potential future
children. That's fine. Gladiator already has a

388
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:24,140
child. He probably has like dozens of kids. He's
fine. What? Yeah, his name is Kid Gladiator,

389
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:29,640
actually. But either way, like Gladiator has
super equilibrium. So he's not dizzy from

390
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:35,020
spinning in the same way that Superman wouldn't be
dizzy from spinning. And in fact, Gladiator was

391
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:40,660
over being stunned after his spin attack. And he
flies away faster than Icon can even raise his

392
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,600
hands to blast him. In fact, Gladiator flies
behind Icon and freezes him with his freeze

393
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:52,140
breath. So Icon's frozen in the Gladiator, he
makers him into like a thousand pieces that just

394
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:58,240
fly across the galaxy. Match over. Well,
actually, Gladiator is going to haymaker a force

395
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:05,400
field of positronic energy set up by Icon. And then
Icon's going to melt his ice casing by emitting

396
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:11,860
energy from his entire body surface, after which
he immediately emits a pulse that's going to shut

397
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:18,060
down the electrical signals in Gladiator's body.
So while he's paralyzed, Icon's going to grab his

398
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:24,980
head and just snap his neck, ending the match. What
is he, Superman? OK, I guess Superman doesn't do

399
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:29,600
that stuff anymore, huh? Well, he's too punk rock
for it. Only good. Wait, so Gladiator hit a

400
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:35,400
positronic force field instead of hitting the
frozen icon. Yeah, right. Wrong. I'd be

401
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:41,500
positronic that that did not happen, because Icon
was in fact frozen to absolute zero, so he couldn't

402
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:45,460
like do anything because he was frozen solid
through and through. So he got smashed to bits

403
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:52,020
instead. I'll tell you what's absolute zero.
Gladiator's chances of winning. You know what?

404
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:56,460
Let's find out. Let's go ahead and put the
character stats, run the simulations and find out

405
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:01,720
which of these scenarios happens. Either
Gladiator freezes Icon and then smashes him to a

406
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:07,500
thousand bits, or Icon protects himself with a
force field, escapes being frozen, paralyzes

407
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:12,460
Gladiator and then snaps his neck. That's just way
too many steps. Hey, it happened. I don't know what

408
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:19,100
to say. Let's run the simulations and come back
with a winner. AJ9K hit it. Inputting data,

409
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:24,260
running calculations, processing results,
simulations complete. All right, these

410
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:29,500
characters like Superman are very powerful,
although they differed in the stats more than I

411
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,480
thought they would. Yeah, they kind of went
through a pattern where they matched a stat and

412
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:37,900
then deferred in a stat. Then matched a stat, then
deferred in a stat. Like they were the same speed,

413
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:44,460
durability, strength, perception, but they
mismatched on evasiveness to Icon's force

414
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:49,880
fields. Fighting skill, we said Gladiator was a
better fighter. Intellect, because we said Icon

415
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:55,500
was smarter and versatility because Icon was more
versatile due to his energy based power set. We

416
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:00,900
also said that Gladiator was capable of more
damage, which kind of surprised me. Only because

417
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:07,180
Icon really doesn't have the same feats that
Gladiator has in terms of damage. Right.

418
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:13,120
Gladiator has been shown to like fly through
Galactus's eye beams and punch planets in half,

419
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:19,220
which is ridiculous. Dude, even went up against
Hyperion, which is Marvel's analog to Superman.

420
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:24,720
You know, their other analog to Superman and beat
Hyperion. So what does that say about Icon's

421
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:30,160
chances? I mean, Icon apparently punched
Superman harder than Darkseid ever has. Like

422
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,320
knocked him all the way out of the watch tower.
That's not that hard, though, if you think about

423
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,120
it. OK. Considering all these stats, Jonathan,
who you putting your money on? Why am I even asking

424
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:44,520
this question? It's a pointless question. We ask
it every dual episode. My money is on Icon. I'm

425
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:50,900
betting on Black. A majority of our Instagram
followers did not, however, 62 percent of them

426
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:55,920
voted in favor of Gladiator winning this. Well,
apparently they're not heating Wesley Snipes

427
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,480
advice. And neither am I. I'm betting on red, which
in this case is Gladiator because he wears red. But

428
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:08,140
either way, let's see which character won. A.G
.9K, the results, please. Hey, you are, sir. All

429
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:16,740
right, the winner between Icon and Gladiator, the
Praetor of the Imperial Guard, the Defender of the

430
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:26,840
Shiar Empire, the former Majestor, the most
badass dude with the most rock and mohawk is Icon.

431
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:37,940
Yes. OK, all those titles that you just listed and
Icon's bitch to that. No. What is happening out of

432
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:46,980
the 1000 matches? Icon won 581 as opposed to
Gladiator who won 419. So Icon wins 58.1 percent of

433
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,980
the time. I don't know what is happening. I feel
like I'm on a losing streak. I feel like the

434
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:57,720
executive producers have obviously conspired
against me because they're the ones who chose this

435
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:04,660
matchup. And I think I need to call an emergency
meeting with them. You know what happened, right?

436
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:10,560
Because you're on this losing streak, you've been
demoralized and that's Gladiator's weakness. I

437
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:16,020
think you're right. Yeah, that makes sense.
Marvel has lost like four in a row now, which is

438
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:21,320
affecting Gladiator's confidence, which in turn
weakens him, which in turn made him lose this

439
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:29,300
match. That sucks. It's fine. It become even more
demoralized. That's what I want. I swear, if this

440
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:35,220
fucking happens again, I am going to break into
your house and then loosen all the lids on your salt

441
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:40,840
and pepper shakers. No. I couldn't think of
anything else. We're going to get him next time,

442
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:44,100
Marvel guys. We're going to get him next time and
then we're going to start our own streak starting

443
00:42:44,100 --> 00:43:21,300
with our next episode. But that does it for this
episode. Adrian A.K. Help close this out. That is

444
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:26,420
going to be BloodSport versus Killmonger. Of
course, BloodSport was in the Suicide Squad

445
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:32,540
played by Idris angle. And Killmonger was in the
Black Panther film played by Michael B Jordan.

446
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:35,720
Yeah, it should be a fun episode. I'm really,
really excited for that one. Been looking forward

447
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,440
to that one for a long time. But that does it for this
episode. We want to give a big thanks to our

448
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,120
executive producers, John Strausky, Zachary
Hepburn, Dustin Balcom, Mickey Mathenguyen,

449
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:49,400
Nathaniel Wagner, Levi Yatn, Austin Wazalowski,
AJ Duckerly, Nick Obanto, Scott Camacho, Gil

450
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:55,520
Camacho, Adam Spees, Dean Molesky, Devin Davis,
Joseph Kirsting, Josh Leiner, Mike Williams, and

451
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:01,000
Paul Graves for helping make this podcast
possible. We'll talk to you guys next week. Up, up

452
00:44:01,000 --> 
and away! True believers. This matchup didn't
have Russell Crowe at all. I want my money back.
