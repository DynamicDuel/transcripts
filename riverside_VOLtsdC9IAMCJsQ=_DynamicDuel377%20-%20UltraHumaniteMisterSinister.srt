00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,963
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,206 --> 00:00:29,069
Hi, welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,089 --> 00:00:34,354
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:34,894 --> 00:00:40,018
I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm his twin brother,
Johnny DC. And in this episode, we are going

5
00:00:40,038 --> 00:00:45,442
to find out who would win in a fight between
the Superman villain known as the Ultra Humanite

6
00:00:45,743 --> 00:00:53,165
versus the X-Men villain known as Mr. Sinister.
Now, I can't believe that we are over 375 episodes

7
00:00:53,365 --> 00:00:57,908
into this podcast and we have not done a duel
episode with Mr. Sinister yet. That's basically

8
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:03,633
a crime. Yeah, same with Ultra Humanite. I mean,
no one knows who Ultra Humanite is. He's like-

9
00:01:03,653 --> 00:01:08,918
BITCH! He's the very first Superman villain.
That's all you need to know. Actually, I would

10
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:14,262
describe him more as a JSA villain. But yeah,
he's got some notoriety. If by notoriety you

11
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:21,715
mean obscurity, then yeah, notoriety. Basically
both of these guys are elite genetic scientists

12
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:26,797
with super powerful power sets. Yes, specifically
when it comes to telepathy and telekinesis.

13
00:01:26,997 --> 00:01:30,999
We'll go ahead and speculate on the battle and
input the stats and run the simulations later

14
00:01:31,039 --> 00:01:35,241
on this episode. Before that, we're gonna break
down the comic book movie news that came out

15
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:41,084
this past week, including news about Joker Follyadoo
and what kind of musical it's gonna be. And

16
00:01:41,124 --> 00:01:45,842
we also got a teaser trailer for the Penguin
Max series. As always, we list our segment

40
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:54,892
Network to review Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,
which is a movie that I love. I was really

41
00:03:54,932 --> 00:04:00,457
sad that I was not able to join that review.

out of the way... Quick! To the No Prize! A
No Prize is an award Marvel used to give out

44
00:04:11,954 --> 00:04:17,638
to fans. Our version, the Dynamic duel No Prize,
is a digital award that we post on Instagram

45
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:23,263
for the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week we asked,

46
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:28,734
what Marvel or DC film do you think had the
best subtitle? and why and this is coming off

47
00:04:28,814 --> 00:04:34,077
of the news that the upcoming Venom sequel is
going to be titled Venom the Last Dance and

48
00:04:34,097 --> 00:04:39,220
we thought that was stupid as hell but we wanted
to hear what the best ones were. We got so

49
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,022
many answers for this question you guys came
out of the woodwork. I was not expecting that

50
00:04:43,322 --> 00:04:47,424
but I truly appreciate it. Yeah we actually
got 10 total answers this week. I can't remember

51
00:04:47,464 --> 00:04:51,206
the last time we received that many answers
so that's exciting. We're going to break down

52
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:57,506
this week's honorable mentions before revealing
the no prize winner. Our first honorable Nate

53
00:04:57,546 --> 00:05:03,031
Wagner who said, Hey, it's Nate here and I got
to go with Captain America Civil War. I think

54
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:08,515
reading the comic originally just had me excited
of how they were going to adapt it into a movie,

55
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:14,380
but almost worried at the same time, just because
there was so much in the comic. And I feel

56
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,185
like they did a really good job overall with
it. So yeah. Okay. So

57
00:05:25,078 --> 00:05:30,400
I don't think Nate Wagner has a kid, so I'm
gonna guess that was a dog. And it seemed like

58
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,101
he disagreed with you. But you know what? I'm
gonna go ahead and agree with you, Nate. I

59
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:37,203
thought Civil War was a great storyline from
the comics. I was super excited when they announced

60
00:05:37,703 --> 00:05:41,564
that as the subtitle for the third Captain America
film because I didn't think that they were

61
00:05:41,584 --> 00:05:45,766
gonna go there. But they went there. And you
know, it was really off the back of the announcement

62
00:05:45,806 --> 00:05:51,569
of the Batman v Superman movie. But right, I
don't count it as copying because Civil War

63
00:05:51,589 --> 00:05:57,992
was actually a better movie than BBS. Oh, it's
copying. It's 100% copying. But you admit that

64
00:05:58,052 --> 00:06:04,057
Civil War was a better movie than BBS. I did
not do any such thing. Although I guess when

65
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:09,540
it comes to specifically the theatrical versions,
sure, I will admit that Civil War was better

66
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:15,504
than BBS, even when it comes to the subtitle,
Civil War versus Dawn of Justice. Yeah, that

67
00:06:15,524 --> 00:06:20,088
was stupid. Thanks, Nate, for the answer. Let's
go ahead and move on to making my thank you

68
00:06:20,148 --> 00:06:24,334
answer, which also gets an honorable mention.
He said. Hey what's up guys, this is Miggy

69
00:06:24,395 --> 00:06:30,300
and my favorite subtitle is the Judas Contract.
This is just a badass sounding biblical illusion.

70
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,664
The foreshadows the plot pretty well. But really
I'm just using this as an excuse to answer

71
00:06:36,025 --> 00:06:39,107
the question of the week that you guys should
have gone with and give my fancast for the

72
00:06:39,147 --> 00:06:44,632
Teen Titans. So I'm gonna say Wolfgang Novogratz
as Robin slash Nightwing, Coco Jones as Starfire,

73
00:06:44,973 --> 00:06:50,477
Stefan James as Cyborg, Amber Mithunder as Raven,
and Marcel Ruiz as Beast Boy. Thanks guys.

74
00:06:51,218 --> 00:06:56,582
Yeah, Mickey Mathagian is an executive producer
of the show, so he does have some leeway regarding

75
00:06:56,642 --> 00:07:01,566
the questions that we ask on this podcast. And
we should have consulted basically, I think,

76
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:07,552
with our ex-pros before coming up with our question
of the week last time, because I think that

77
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:13,056
with the announcement that DC is working on
a Teen Titans movie, that should have absolutely

78
00:07:13,076 --> 00:07:17,200
been our question of the week. And it's not
a terrible cast that Mickey came up with. As

79
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:23,042
far as the Judas contract goes. Also a great
choice and also like you mentioned an allusion

80
00:07:23,102 --> 00:07:29,264
to a betrayal that would happen within the team
much better than you know Teen Titans, Terror's

81
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:35,666
Betrayal Let's go ahead and move into our final
honorable mention which goes to Caleb Folk

82
00:07:35,986 --> 00:07:42,628
who said hey guys Caleb Folk again I think the
best marveler dc subtitle has to be avengers

83
00:07:42,768 --> 00:07:52,364
endgame Just because not only did it leave suspense
After the infinity war ending But also it symbolizes

84
00:07:52,404 --> 00:07:59,970
the ending of Iron Man, Captain America, Black
Widow, Thor not being the leader of Asgard

85
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:06,415
anymore. I just think that has to be the best
subtitle that any movie's had. Yeah, Infinity

86
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:12,560
War ended with such a cliffhanger. You know,
basically half the entire universe was snapped

87
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:17,775
out of existence by Thanos. So I remember everyone
who was on the edge of our seats, including

88
00:08:17,815 --> 00:08:21,738
this podcast. And if you go back and listen
to those episodes, we were heavily speculating

89
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:27,402
on what the subtitle would be for the fourth
Avengers film. When it was revealed to be endgame,

90
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:31,945
it just felt right. Not only because it was
a direct reference to a quote from Dr. Strange

91
00:08:32,285 --> 00:08:37,009
in the Infinity War film where he says, run
the end game now, but it just had this finality

92
00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:42,032
to it where you knew that this was going to
be the culmination of the entire Infinity War

93
00:08:42,092 --> 00:08:46,706
saga and that it was just going to be epic.
Right. And especially, you know, like post

94
00:08:46,846 --> 00:08:52,889
end game, you kind of wish the end game was
the end of all MCU films because they've just

95
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:57,071
got to shit since then. Now, it really should
have been the end. Shut up. Just you sound

96
00:08:57,271 --> 00:09:01,893
stupid right now. That was the dumbest thing
I've you've ever said on this podcast. I don't

97
00:09:02,433 --> 00:09:06,915
know. I think a lot of people agree with me.
Well, those people are wrong and they could

98
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:11,957
be wrong. Great answer, Caleb. We want to give
a quick shout out to Travis Herndon, who gave

99
00:09:11,997 --> 00:09:17,627
the answer of homecoming. Andrew Shunk, who
gave the answer The Quest for Peace. Colby

100
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:25,450
Hentges, who gave Four Vendetta. Mitchell Smoothie,
who said Under the Red Hood. Scott Camacho,

101
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:31,513
who gave the answer of the Dark Knight trilogy.
And Sean Curtis, who gave an answer from last

102
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:37,295
week regarding video games. Basically chiming
in since nobody gave a DC answer for the last

103
00:09:37,315 --> 00:09:42,777
question of the week. But the winner of this
week's NOAH Prize goes to Noah Terry, who said.

104
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:50,966
Hey guys, I think that the best subtitle for
a Marvel or DC movie has to be Black Panther

105
00:09:51,006 --> 00:09:58,391
Wakanda Forever. I feel that the movie is just
a perfect tribute to Chadwick Boseman, and

106
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:05,175
the way that the subtitle perfectly represents
Shuri taking up his legacy as the Black Panther

107
00:10:05,255 --> 00:10:12,239
is just perfect. It's an amazing movie. Thanks.
Bye, guys. Wakanda Forever is basically this

108
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:18,362
salute representing the pride that Wakandans
have in their home country and Chadwick Boseman

109
00:10:18,482 --> 00:10:23,925
personified the vision of T'Challa the Black
Panther in the first Black Panther film and

110
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:29,588
after his untimely tragic passing due to cancer.
It was a really nice tribute for the sequel

111
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:35,772
to reference that pride that a lot of people
felt in seeing Wakanda represented on screen.

112
00:10:36,172 --> 00:10:43,020
It just felt like it was a mark. of his legacy
on the franchise. Right, that even though he

113
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:48,943
had passed, Wakanda was still going to live
on in the hearts of everyone who just fell

114
00:10:48,983 --> 00:10:55,087
in love with the concept of the African nation.
Yeah, it was a very sentimental subtitle and

115
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:59,629
I think it was just perfect. I also like the
fact that not only did it allude to Shuri carrying

116
00:10:59,689 --> 00:11:05,112
on the mantle of Black Panther, but also that
T'Challa's legacy would continue as well. Yeah,

117
00:11:05,292 --> 00:11:10,296
the movie's all about legacy and... the title
definitely evoked that. It worked on a variety

118
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:14,181
of different levels. And that's why that answer
wins this week's No Prize. So congrats to Noah

119
00:11:14,201 --> 00:11:18,906
Terry for winning. If you, the listener, won
a shot at winning your own No Prize, stay tuned

120
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:23,091
to later on this episode when we'll be asking
another Question of the Week. And now that

121
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:25,113
that's done, on to the news.

122
00:11:30,966 --> 00:11:37,029
Okay, so last week Variety shed some light on
the type of musical that the Joker sequel,

123
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:42,592
Joker, if all you do, is going to be. When we
first heard that the Joker sequel was going

124
00:11:42,612 --> 00:11:49,936
to be a musical, there was quite a bit of mixed
reaction online. Most of it was rage. Not too

125
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:54,719
many people like the idea of the sequel being
a musical. I for one was not one of those people

126
00:11:54,759 --> 00:12:01,682
though. I like some musicals. You know, I like
Sweeney Todd. I like Prince of Egypt. I even

127
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:06,684
liked the new Wonka movie that came out recently.
So I thought a musical could make this movie

128
00:12:06,765 --> 00:12:13,747
fairly interesting. But now we've learned that
Joker Fali Ado is going to be a jukebox musical

129
00:12:13,927 --> 00:12:20,810
in that it's not going to have original songs.
It's going to have up to 15 cover songs. So

130
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:27,813
it's going to be something more like Mamma Mia
or Moulin Rouge. And to me, those films are

131
00:12:27,853 --> 00:12:33,308
more about the music as opposed to the story.
Yeah, the quality of the movie is almost more

132
00:12:33,348 --> 00:12:40,811
about the song choices that they make, right?
Exactly. So hearing this news was so extremely

133
00:12:40,851 --> 00:12:46,754
disappointing because I had been really championing
this film to all the haters who did not like

134
00:12:46,794 --> 00:12:52,876
the fact that it was going to be a musical.
And now I myself am not excited that this film

135
00:12:52,936 --> 00:12:57,506
is going to be a musical because it's like a
lazy musical. They didn't put forth any effort

136
00:12:57,526 --> 00:13:02,267
to write original songs, even though there may
be two original songs in the movie. They're

137
00:13:02,287 --> 00:13:06,689
not sure yet if they have enough time to insert
them. One of the songs we've learned is going

138
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:13,831
to be That's Entertainment from the 1953 musical
The Bandwagon starring Judy Garland. The one

139
00:13:14,011 --> 00:13:19,032
interesting thing about this is that I guess
Hildur Gunnedadder, who did the score for the

140
00:13:19,072 --> 00:13:24,707
first film and won an Oscar for that film, is
recomposing all of the new pieces and Variety

141
00:13:24,747 --> 00:13:31,231
says that she will infuse her distinctive haunting
music cues into each number. I guess that's

142
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:37,416
kinda cool. Ultimately, I think it kinda depends
on what song choices you're going with though.

143
00:13:37,596 --> 00:13:43,440
Are people who aren't fans of the bandwagon
going to be excited by that's entertainment?

144
00:13:44,061 --> 00:13:48,344
I don't think so. If they're going with that
song, it almost seems like they're going with

145
00:13:48,484 --> 00:13:54,259
music throughout cinematic musical history.
Kind of like how the first Joker film was an

146
00:13:54,279 --> 00:14:00,782
homage to Martin Scorsese films, you know? Right.
This movie might be an homage to classic musicals.

147
00:14:01,342 --> 00:14:05,825
Yeah, maybe. Yeah, maybe we'll get like Singing
in the Rain, almost like giving a Clockwork

148
00:14:05,905 --> 00:14:10,567
Orange kind of homage. I don't know. I have
no idea. The trailer is supposed to be coming

149
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:16,810
out soon-ish, I think in April, but I'm not
sure how much music they're going to... unveil

150
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:21,991
in that trailer or even market it as a musical
because Warner Brothers recent musicals haven't

151
00:14:22,031 --> 00:14:27,533
been advertised that way including Guanka. Yeah
I also am disappointed to hear that this is

152
00:14:27,553 --> 00:14:33,334
gonna be more rock of ages than Sweeney Todd
but I wonder if Lady Gaga is gonna have any

153
00:14:33,354 --> 00:14:38,916
of her own songs in there like Bad Romance or
something that would be so bizarre. That would

154
00:14:38,936 --> 00:14:42,817
be awful I would hate that. Harley Quinn all
of a sudden is like I want to take a ride on

155
00:14:42,837 --> 00:14:50,534
your disco stick. Eh, jeez. Who knows? Maybe.
But considering the fact that Joker Folly I

156
00:14:50,574 --> 00:14:54,441
Do is going to be a jukebox musical, that brings
us to our question of the week.

157
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:05,648
What song do you hope to hear in Joker Follyadoo,
and what character would sing it? This is a

158
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:10,170
fantastic question. If you guys wanna sing your
answer to as you submit it, you might get extra

165
00:15:42,279 --> 00:15:50,382
DC news, in good DC news, we got our first official
teaser trailer for the Mac series The Penguin,

166
00:15:50,663 --> 00:15:57,225
which is a sequel to the phenomenal 2022 film
The Batman. Colin Farrell is returning as The

167
00:15:57,265 --> 00:16:02,838
Penguin. And the teaser trailer shows him recounting
the story of this old mobster that he used

168
00:16:02,858 --> 00:16:08,002
to look up to who died and how a parade was
thrown in his honor. He really likes the idea

169
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:13,387
of that kind of legacy. Intercut between his
voiceover, we see a lot of shots of the penguin

170
00:16:13,707 --> 00:16:19,572
walking around being menacing. But we also get
our first looks at Sofia and Alberto Falcone,

171
00:16:19,672 --> 00:16:25,097
which is really exciting and interesting. These
are characters that play big roles in The Long

172
00:16:25,137 --> 00:16:31,192
Halloween. which is a comic book storyline that
is often touted as inspiration for many of

173
00:16:31,212 --> 00:16:36,834
these Batman films. And we also get to see Clancy
Brown as Salvatore Moroni and Michael Kelly

174
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:41,677
as Johnny Vitti. All of these characters were
in The Long Halloween and I bet these are going

175
00:16:41,697 --> 00:16:46,459
to be amazing performances. But of course the
best one looks like it's going to come once

176
00:16:46,479 --> 00:16:54,130
again from Colin Farrell. He is still unrecognizable
in the role of Oswald Cobblepot. Yeah, he definitely

177
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:59,735
inhabits his character. It's interesting that
they chose to go with this anecdote about a

178
00:16:59,915 --> 00:17:05,340
local mobster that was in his neighborhood as
a child. It makes it seem like his entire motivation

179
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:10,785
throughout the course of this season is going
to be the respect and love of the people around

180
00:17:10,845 --> 00:17:16,129
him, which is an interesting motivation for
a character like the Penguin, because usually

181
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:20,113
his motivation is avarice. You know, he's a
greedy son of a bitch in the world of Batman

182
00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:25,398
and I don't remember him ever like looking for
adoration in that way. Um, I think it still

183
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:29,882
fits with the character because you know, the
character is deformed. We see that he's wearing

184
00:17:29,902 --> 00:17:34,986
a leg brace in the teaser trailer, which gives
him a wobble, probably why he's referred to

185
00:17:35,086 --> 00:17:40,712
as the Penguin. I absolutely buy the fact that
the Penguin would be looking for adoration

186
00:17:41,012 --> 00:17:45,871
and respect from his community. Because I feel
like because of his deformities, he probably

187
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:50,373
doesn't get too much of that. So it'd be something
the character wants. Do you think he doesn't

188
00:17:50,413 --> 00:17:54,975
get too much respect because he walks around
in a fat suit? That is obviously a fat suit.

189
00:17:55,415 --> 00:18:00,837
That is not obviously a fat suit. That is like
one of the best makeup jobs I've ever seen.

190
00:18:01,457 --> 00:18:08,500
Obviously a fat suit. Oh, my gosh. You know
it. I know it. He's basically fat bastards,

191
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:15,945
Italian gangster cousin. is not a good color
on you, my friend. You know this show looks

192
00:18:15,985 --> 00:18:20,409
incredible and you can try to insult it all
you want. It doesn't change the fact that the

193
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:26,894
show looks like it's going to be like a really
awesome DC Comics, sopranos type crime drama.

194
00:18:27,394 --> 00:18:33,039
I would like to get a hashtag going inspired
by John Strausky of the Console Combat Podcast,

195
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:39,765
who on the Discord referred to the Penguin as
Fat Mobstered. I think that's perfect. I think

196
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:44,492
that's a perfect description of him. and henceforth
I will only be referring to Colin Farrell's

197
00:18:44,512 --> 00:18:50,878
Penguin as Fat Mobster. And I would like to
get a hashtag going that's hashtag fuck Joseph.

198
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:58,084
That could go the wrong way real quick. Let's
not do that. Wait what? Okay yeah let's not

199
00:18:58,124 --> 00:19:02,948
do that. We don't have an official release date
for the Penguin yet. We just know that it's

200
00:19:02,968 --> 00:19:08,753
coming out this fall and I'm super looking forward
to it. This teaser trailer totally did its

201
00:19:08,793 --> 00:19:14,313
job. And it makes me look forward to the Batman
sequel that we're getting in 2026 even more.

202
00:19:14,694 --> 00:19:16,597
Get in my belly.

203
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,351
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and get into

204
00:19:27,412 --> 00:19:33,255
our main event where we find out who would win
in a fight between the JSA slash Superman villain,

205
00:19:33,635 --> 00:19:37,777
Ultra Humanite, versus the X-Men villain, Mr.
Sinister.

206
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:58,094
Alright, Ultra Humanite versus Mr. Sinister.
As we stated at the top of this episode, we

207
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:03,058
are pitting these two characters against each
other because they both are experts in genetics

208
00:20:03,378 --> 00:20:08,582
and they both have psychic abilities. They're
super powerful too. Ultra Humanite is the villain

209
00:20:08,623 --> 00:20:15,528
for not only Superman, but the entire JSA. And
Mr. Sinister is an acolyte of Apocalypse himself,

210
00:20:15,668 --> 00:20:19,552
even though he's kind of branched away from
Apocalypse and has gone on to plague not only

211
00:20:19,572 --> 00:20:26,196
the X-Men, but mutant kind in general. Yeah,
of course we saw a brief cameo of Mr. Sinister

212
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:32,560
in X-Men Apocalypse. It wasn't a cameo of him,
it was a cameo of someone who worked for SX

213
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,343
Corporation. Which is supposed to be, I guess,
one of Mr. Sinister's holding companies or

214
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:41,626
something. I don't know. They were obtaining
a genetic sample of Wolverine from the Weapon

215
00:20:41,726 --> 00:20:47,569
X program. Okay, that's lame. We did get the
Ultra-Humanite as the main antagonist of Stargirl

216
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:52,112
season 3. three and really the main antagonist
of the whole series. Interesting. I never watched

217
00:20:52,152 --> 00:20:57,276
that show. Was he primarily a big white gorilla
or did he have another form? To answer that

218
00:20:57,296 --> 00:21:03,540
would probably be a spoiler so I plead the fifth.
Interesting. Okay. I think the initial matchup

219
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:09,445
for this episode was gonna be Mr. Sinister versus
Malefic who is Martian Manhunter's brother

220
00:21:09,905 --> 00:21:16,109
who you know has the Martian abilities of telepathy
and is also a shapeshifter just like Mr. Sinister.

221
00:21:16,606 --> 00:21:21,488
I think that would have been a wiser choice
on your part, and I think that you and Team

222
00:21:21,528 --> 00:21:27,530
DC are going down for switching to Ultra Humanite.
And I think you will rue the day that you ever

223
00:21:27,670 --> 00:21:35,053
underestimated Ultra Humanite, fool! Okay. To
explain the methodology behind our duels, let's

224
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:40,636
go to our sentient duel simulator, Alfred Jarvis
9000. H-E-9K, tell our listeners how you go

225
00:21:40,676 --> 00:21:45,686
about determining a winner in our duel matchups.
Yes, of course, sir. The way I determine a

226
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:50,527
winner between the contestants is by running
1000 Monte Carlo simulations using the characters

227
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:56,129
statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic
model used to determine outcomes through random

228
00:21:56,209 --> 00:22:02,030
sampling. In this case, I randomise the statistics
along a normal distribution as a way to simulate

229
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,651
the many variables that can occur during battle.
The stat parameters are based on the official

230
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:12,013
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat

231
00:22:12,053 --> 00:22:17,563
categories are included such as range, damage
potential, versatility and perception in order

232
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:23,024
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.
The results of the 1000 simulations provide

233
00:22:23,044 --> 00:22:27,406
a percentage of wins for each character. The
contestant with the higher percentage is declared

234
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:32,727
the victor as they have a higher probability
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,

235
00:22:33,107 --> 00:22:37,909
neither character should win 100% of the matches.
The comic book stories have shown that there's

236
00:22:38,049 --> 00:22:42,864
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman. So
the confidence rate of my method falls in line

237
00:22:42,884 --> 00:22:47,468
with the precedents that have been established
in the source material. My mathematical simulations

238
00:22:47,508 --> 00:22:52,672
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes

239
00:22:52,712 --> 00:22:58,857
tabulated for determination of the winner. Thanks
AJ9K! Before we run the simulations though,

240
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,862
we like to break down each character's histories
and abilities before improvising a scenario

241
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:09,574
on how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations
would play out for beat. and I believe it's

242
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:14,095
your turn to go first with the Marvel characters
backstory. That's right, yeah, let me go ahead

243
00:23:14,115 --> 00:23:19,937
and tell you all about Mr. Sinister. Nathaniel
Essex was born in England in the mid-1800s

244
00:23:20,877 --> 00:23:27,399
to a noble British family. Growing up fascinated
with biology, Nathaniel studied at Oxford University,

245
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:33,021
becoming one of the foremost minds of his generation.
He fell in love with an English woman named

246
00:23:33,081 --> 00:23:39,327
Rebecca, and the two had a son named Adam. However,
Adam was born with numerous birth defects and

247
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:45,330
ailments, passing away as a child at the young
age of four. This tragedy drove Nathaniel deeper

248
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:50,693
into his studies in genetics and Darwin's theories,
leading him to believe that through rapid evolution,

249
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:57,397
humanity could achieve perfection without defects.
Obsessed, he sought to push evolutionary science

250
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:02,480
to its limits, believing his contemporaries
were too bound by their concepts of morality.

251
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:08,199
Nathaniel became rejected by his peers for his
work. as he hired a group of criminals he dubbed

252
00:24:08,259 --> 00:24:14,084
the Marauders to kidnap people with deformities
for him to experiment on. He even exhumed his

253
00:24:14,144 --> 00:24:19,748
son's corpse to further his research, an act
which estranged his wife, who was once again

254
00:24:19,788 --> 00:24:24,972
pregnant. In the Marauders' search for test
subjects, they stumbled upon and awakened the

255
00:24:25,092 --> 00:24:30,616
ancient mutant known as Apocalypse, who sought
to reshape the world into its strongest potential

256
00:24:30,696 --> 00:24:36,551
through survival of the fittest. Seeing Nathaniel's
work as a means to that end, Apocalypse offered

257
00:24:36,591 --> 00:24:43,094
the scientist immortality and power if he served
him. Conflicted by the offer, Nathaniel returned

258
00:24:43,154 --> 00:24:48,997
home to Rebecca, only to find that she and their
new baby were dying due to a premature labor.

259
00:24:49,417 --> 00:24:54,259
Though he pleaded for his wife's forgiveness
in her last moments, her final words were simply

260
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:59,821
to call him, sinister. Distraught, Nathaniel
returned to Apocalypse to swear fealty to him.

261
00:25:00,238 --> 00:25:06,561
who genetically altered him into a superhuman,
undying, psychic being, now going only by Mr.

262
00:25:06,641 --> 00:25:11,344
Sinister. You can learn more about Apocalypse
in our duel episode where we pit him against

263
00:25:11,404 --> 00:25:17,908
Black Adam. Apocalypse had Sinister create a
plague to wipe out most of humanity, but Sinister

264
00:25:17,928 --> 00:25:23,391
was hesitant as he figured it would hamper his
experiments. Fearful of Apocalypse, Sinister

265
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:29,742
instead created a techno-virus that would infect
Apocalypse's forcing Apocalypse to retreat

266
00:25:29,762 --> 00:25:35,625
to his regeneration chamber for decades as he
purged the infection. Knowing that he had created

267
00:25:35,685 --> 00:25:41,207
an enemy out of the world's most powerful mutant,
Sinister began working on genetically enhancing

268
00:25:41,267 --> 00:25:46,209
his own form. He traveled the world searching
for mutants to obtain their genetic samples

269
00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:52,212
to aid his research and occasionally add their
power set, such as shapeshifting, to his own.

270
00:25:52,692 --> 00:25:57,058
Sinister worked alongside the high evolutionary
for a time. whom you can learn more about in

271
00:25:57,078 --> 00:26:01,859
his duel against Despero, and he worked as a
Nazi scientist where he was given free rein

272
00:26:01,899 --> 00:26:08,061
to experiment on any prisoner he desired. This
earned the enmity of Magneto, who was a prisoner

273
00:26:08,141 --> 00:26:12,843
at Auschwitz and whom you can learn more about
in his duel against Sinestro. With the Nazis

274
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:18,004
defeated and Sinister's labs shut down by Captain
America and Nick Fury's howling commandos,

275
00:26:18,484 --> 00:26:23,606
he set about finding another way to protect
himself from apocalypse. Eventually, Sinister

276
00:26:23,646 --> 00:26:28,549
set up orphanages where he would seek out young
mutants to manipulate, and found the perfect

277
00:26:28,609 --> 00:26:34,553
candidate in Scott and Alex Summers, the boys
who would grow up to become Cyclops and Havoc

278
00:26:34,613 --> 00:26:40,677
respectively. He separated the brothers to isolate
and study Scott's genetics, theorizing that

279
00:26:40,717 --> 00:26:46,000
the offspring between him and another young
mutant named Jean Grey would be powerful enough

280
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:51,511
to challenge apocalypse himself. Sinister planned
to kidnap young Jean Grey, sensing her vast

281
00:26:51,551 --> 00:26:57,255
psychic potential, but the child was discovered
and mentored first by Professor Charles Xavier,

282
00:26:57,375 --> 00:27:02,958
whom Sinister knew to steer clear of. Coincidentally
however, both Scott and Jean were eventually

283
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:07,501
recruited into Professor X's school for the
gifted, and Sinister's secret plan was set

284
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:12,623
into motion. You can learn more about this in
our Negative Man vs Cyclops duel, our Raven

285
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:18,234
vs Phoenix duel, and our Chief vs Professor
X duel. When it later appeared as if Jean Grey

286
00:27:18,294 --> 00:27:24,236
died during an X-Men mission in space, Sinister
used a genetic sample he had to produce a clone

287
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:30,538
of her, which he named Madeline Pryor. He psychically
brainwashed her into loving Cyclops and arranged

288
00:27:30,578 --> 00:27:35,799
for the two to meet. Sinister's plan worked,
and the couple wed and became pregnant with

289
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:41,281
a son named Nathan. Meanwhile, in an effort
to ensure the mutant gene pool remained strong

290
00:27:41,441 --> 00:27:47,463
and without defects he deemed as lesser, Sinister
ordered his newest team of Marauders to massacre

291
00:27:47,603 --> 00:27:53,045
a group of mutant outcasts that had been living
in the sewers in fear of humanity. The X-Men

292
00:27:53,085 --> 00:27:58,167
tried to stop this mass murder, but suffered
heavy casualties in the process, including

293
00:27:58,227 --> 00:28:04,370
the Mutant Angel, whom you can learn more about
in our Zereal vs Archangel episode. Eventually,

294
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:10,152
Jean Grey was revealed to still be alive, prompting
Sinister to try to kill her clone, Madeline

295
00:28:10,192 --> 00:28:15,554
Pryor, before the secret behind her creation
was revealed. Though the X-Men managed to save

296
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:21,276
Madeline, Sinister was successful in kidnapping
Baby Nathan for a time, planning to train him

297
00:28:21,516 --> 00:28:26,898
against Apocalypse. However, Cyclops was able
to rescue his son by destroying Sinister with

298
00:28:26,938 --> 00:28:31,819
a massive optic blast that the villain was only
able to survive thanks to his highly malleable

299
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:37,641
and regenerative form. Soon after, Apocalypse
returned. Upon learning of Sinister's plan

300
00:28:37,661 --> 00:28:43,331
for Cyclops' son, Apocalypse infected the baby
with a techno-organic virus that would consume

301
00:28:43,371 --> 00:28:48,633
his body with cybernetics and kill him, prompting
Cyclops and Jean Grey to send the child into

302
00:28:48,653 --> 00:28:53,935
the future where he could be cared for, a timeline
where Apocalypse ruled and where Nathan was

303
00:28:53,995 --> 00:28:59,398
prophesied to defeat him. Eventually, Nathan
would return to the present as the mutant soldier

304
00:28:59,438 --> 00:29:04,140
hero Cable, whom you can learn more about in
our Booster Gold vs. Cable duel episode.

305
00:29:09,266 --> 00:29:13,807
offering to give him Cyclops and Jean Grey in
exchange for Strife getting him the future

306
00:29:13,847 --> 00:29:19,608
genetic material of the Summers family. Sinister
double-crossed Strife by leading the X-Men

307
00:29:19,648 --> 00:29:24,490
to him, however he was also betrayed as the
canister that was supposed to contain the genetic

308
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:30,472
samples actually contained the Legacy Virus,
a pathogen that was released into the atmosphere

309
00:29:30,772 --> 00:29:36,473
that was fatal to mutants. Seeing the virus
as detrimental to his work, he went about studying

310
00:29:36,553 --> 00:29:40,954
it to find a cure. and though the solution would
ultimately be discovered by the X-Men member

311
00:29:40,994 --> 00:29:46,836
Beast, Sinister's research did assist him. With
the mutant population having dwindled in the

312
00:29:46,896 --> 00:29:52,218
wake of the legacy virus, Sinister's pool of
test subjects was running low, leading him

313
00:29:52,238 --> 00:29:58,140
to create a formula that would spontaneously
induce mutation in humans. This was opposed

314
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:02,801
by the X-Men members Bishop and Gambit, who
destroyed Sinister's laboratory and research.

315
00:30:03,462 --> 00:30:07,783
After the events of Emde, when the Scarlet Witch
depowered most of the world's mutants in a

316
00:30:07,863 --> 00:30:14,126
fit of madness, Sinister found his entire cause
destroyed. The first new mutant child to be

317
00:30:14,186 --> 00:30:20,629
born after Emde was sought after by many groups,
seeking to kill, use, or experiment on her,

318
00:30:21,129 --> 00:30:26,612
Sinister being one of the latter. He reformed
the Marauders to seize the child, and though

319
00:30:26,632 --> 00:30:32,386
they were successful, Sinister was killed by
Mystique who also sought her. In the end, Cable

320
00:30:32,426 --> 00:30:36,927
was able to rescue the firstborn mutant and
took her into the future, naming her Hope.

321
00:30:37,407 --> 00:30:42,769
Sinister had a plethora of fail-safes for death,
however, including a vast legion of his own

322
00:30:42,829 --> 00:30:48,090
genetic clones for his mind to possess. He and
his clones created in the underground city

323
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:54,292
in Alaska, inspired by 19th century London,
from where he attempted to manipulate the returning

324
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:59,793
Phoenix Force, which had possessed a group of
mutants including Cyclops, Emma Frost, the

325
00:30:59,853 --> 00:31:06,423
Sub-Mariner, magic and colossus. Despite Sinister's
efforts to transfer the power into five Jean

326
00:31:06,463 --> 00:31:12,148
Grey clones that he could control, the Phoenix
V incinerated his city and the Phoenix's power

327
00:31:12,248 --> 00:31:16,852
would eventually be used by Hope to restore
the mutant abilities of those who lost them

328
00:31:17,112 --> 00:31:22,757
on M-Day. During a battle with Thanos, the hero
Blackbolt released the Terragen mists into

329
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:27,962
the atmosphere, an event you can learn more
about in our Shazam vs Blackbolt episode. These

330
00:31:28,062 --> 00:31:33,464
mists, though they induced change in inhumans,
proved to be fatal to mutants that were exposed

331
00:31:33,504 --> 00:31:39,827
to them. This inspired Sinister to capture inhumans
and mutants to combine their DNA. Those efforts

332
00:31:39,907 --> 00:31:45,229
were discovered and stopped by the X-Men. When
Professor X and Magneto founded a new mutant

333
00:31:45,269 --> 00:31:50,991
paradise nation on the Sentient Island of Krakoa,
they developed a means of mutant resurrection

334
00:31:51,251 --> 00:31:57,298
using a combination of mutant powers, including
mass generation, reality warping, manipulation,

335
00:31:57,538 --> 00:32:03,562
and genetic and psychic archiving. Since Sinister
had a database of DNA from nearly every mutant

336
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:09,425
who ever existed, Professor X approached him
to request access to it. Sinister initially

337
00:32:09,465 --> 00:32:14,468
declined, but the Professor, being the more
powerful psychic, repressed Sinister's memory

338
00:32:14,628 --> 00:32:19,110
of their meeting so that he would give Krakoa
the access it needed without him ever knowing

339
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:24,673
it. In exchange, Professor X and Magneto asked
Sinister to join their head council of government,

340
00:32:24,926 --> 00:32:30,729
over the island and mutant affairs. Sinister
used his position to secretly implant a portion

341
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:36,652
of his own DNA into every resurrected mutant,
planning on eventually transforming every mutant

342
00:32:36,712 --> 00:32:42,936
into a clone of himself. Eventually he was successful,
leading to a timeline where he had subjugated

343
00:32:42,996 --> 00:32:49,359
the entire planet and eventually the galaxy,
ruling for a horrific 1000 years as he attempted

344
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:55,242
to evolve into godhood. However, that timeline
was eventually reset. and Sinister was exiled

345
00:32:55,322 --> 00:33:01,066
into the pit of Krakoa for eternity for his
deeds. And that's his backstory. Powers-wise,

346
00:33:01,206 --> 00:33:06,829
Mr. Sinister is a human mutate with genetic
enhancements given to him by apocalypse. These

347
00:33:06,849 --> 00:33:12,232
include the psychic abilities of telepathy and
telekinesis, which allow him access to opponents'

348
00:33:12,292 --> 00:33:17,375
minds within moderate proximity wherein he can
read their minds, psychically communicate with

349
00:33:17,415 --> 00:33:24,007
them, sedate them, erase them, alter them, and
control them. He can emit psychic blasts that

350
00:33:24,047 --> 00:33:29,731
cause mental pain, as well as erect psychic
defenses to protect his own mind. He can also

351
00:33:29,771 --> 00:33:34,434
project his consciousness into others, which
he commonly does to escape death. With his

352
00:33:34,494 --> 00:33:39,378
telekinetic abilities, Mr. Sinister can project
a psychokinetic force that allows him to levitate

353
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:45,662
himself or other objects. With this, he can
also generate concussive blasts or force fields.

354
00:33:46,163 --> 00:33:50,818
Having incorporated the powers of other mutants
he has encountered over the decades, Sinister

355
00:33:50,998 --> 00:33:55,640
also has the ability to shape shift and has
complete control over every molecule in his

356
00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:01,884
body. This not only makes him virtually indestructible
or permeable, but it also gives him a regenerative

357
00:34:01,924 --> 00:34:07,367
healing factor and makes him a master of disguise.
Sinister also acquired physical enhancements

358
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:13,470
including strength, able to lift 10 tons, enhanced
durability, and speed. He's one of the most

359
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:19,353
intelligent minds on Earth as a genius level
scientist in biology, chemistry, and psychology.

360
00:34:19,854 --> 00:34:24,095
He's highly adept in the fields of mechanics
and engineering, having developed a number

361
00:34:24,155 --> 00:34:28,956
of inventions in his fortress to aid him in
his research, such as genetic transfer machines

362
00:34:29,196 --> 00:34:35,178
and teleportation devices. And that's Sinister.
Oh, you think Sinister's smart, huh? Ultra-Humanite

363
00:34:35,218 --> 00:34:41,240
has actually been said to be the smartest being
on Earth in the DC Comics universe. Smarter

364
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:46,501
than Lex Luthor, smarter than Batman. He is
the smartest. And yet he's basically achieved

365
00:34:46,621 --> 00:34:53,669
nothing. What? Hence his obscurity. He has achieved
plenty. Let me get into it. For reasons unknown,

366
00:34:54,029 --> 00:35:00,074
Gerard Schuegel was born with an advanced intellect
and a degenerative disease that caused him

367
00:35:00,094 --> 00:35:05,317
to age rapidly. Though he came to believe his
body was unable to cope with the vast amount

368
00:35:05,377 --> 00:35:11,502
of energy his brain required. By the time Gerard
was a young man, he resembled an elderly man

369
00:35:11,762 --> 00:35:16,685
and was confined to a wheelchair, forced to
experiment on himself in order to survive.

370
00:35:17,026 --> 00:35:22,611
which further boosted his intellect. Angered
by his predicament, Gerard began devising plans

371
00:35:22,671 --> 00:35:28,296
to conquer and rule the planet as the villain,
Ultra Humanite, battling Superman from behind

372
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:33,981
the scenes with experimental weaponry, vehicles,
and plagues. You can learn more about Superman

373
00:35:34,421 --> 00:35:40,527
in our Superman versus Dr. Doom episode. After
an attempt to hypnotize Superman failed, Ultra

374
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:45,786
Humanite attempted to shoot Superman with a
laser cannon. only for Superman to pull Ultra

375
00:35:45,946 --> 00:35:51,909
into the Fire Inc path. Though Ultra seemingly
died, he had arranged for his brain to be placed

376
00:35:51,989 --> 00:35:58,432
into a kidnapped actress named Dolores Winters
to avoid any suspicion for his continued criminal

377
00:35:58,512 --> 00:36:04,894
activities. While in this form, Ultra battled
the All-Star Squadron during World War II using

378
00:36:04,974 --> 00:36:10,356
a power-boosting gemstone known as the Power
Stone to bestow powers to several villains,

379
00:36:10,697 --> 00:36:17,915
including Amazing and Death Bolt. Ultra's future
self also aided in his villainous campaign

380
00:36:18,235 --> 00:36:23,996
to extort the US for millions of dollars by
sending a brainwashed Infinity Inc., a team

381
00:36:24,037 --> 00:36:28,938
largely composed of the superpowered children
of the Justice Society of America, and members

382
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:34,139
of the Seeker Society of Super-Villains back
in time to battle the Squadron. Ultimately,

383
00:36:34,519 --> 00:36:39,821
Amazing Band and Cyclotron turned against the
Ultra-Humanite who made them and seemingly

384
00:36:39,881 --> 00:36:46,243
killed him, or her as Dolores. Ultrahumanite's
mind survived, however, trapped within the

385
00:36:46,283 --> 00:36:52,364
mind of Dolores Winters, who was revealed to
have cancer and was hospitalized. Eventually,

386
00:36:52,404 --> 00:36:58,786
the time-traveling villain Perdigaton and Despero
found Ultrahumanite and kidnapped Dolores from

387
00:36:58,826 --> 00:37:04,908
the hospital, allowing Ultrahumanite to transfer
his mind into a genetically mutated albino

388
00:37:04,948 --> 00:37:10,502
gorilla from Gorilla City, which possessed the
strength to house his mind. while also giving

389
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:15,803
him a formidable physical form as well. You
can learn more about Gorilla City in our Gorilla

390
00:37:15,843 --> 00:37:21,545
Grodd vs Psylocke episode. For a time, Ultra
Humanite traveled through time with Perdegaton,

391
00:37:21,645 --> 00:37:27,167
Despero, and Mr. Mind, among other villains,
forming a group known as the Time Steelers,

392
00:37:27,527 --> 00:37:32,509
though they were eventually defeated by Booster
Gold and the Blue Beetle Ted Kord and sent

393
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:37,963
back to their original timelines. Back in his
timeline, Ultra formed the Seeker Society of

394
00:37:38,023 --> 00:37:43,148
Super-Villains, which battled the Justice League
and Justice Society before being banished to

395
00:37:43,188 --> 00:37:49,073
an interdimensional limbo. The Ultra was rescued
from this fate with the help of his past, Dolores

396
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:54,057
Winter, self. The two versions of the Ultra-Humanites
teamed up to stop the All-Star Squadron in

397
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:59,962
the past, though the Ape Ultra ultimately fell
at the hands of Infinity Inc. Ultra-Humanite

398
00:38:00,022 --> 00:38:05,918
eventually became the chief antagonist of the
Justice Society of America. After several battles,

399
00:38:06,278 --> 00:38:11,639
Ultra secretly took over the body of retired
JSA member Johnny Thunder, who you can learn

400
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:16,941
more about in our Jekim Thunder vs Wiccan duel
episode. With the power of Johnny Thunder's

401
00:38:17,021 --> 00:38:23,203
5th dimensional genie under his control, Ultra
Humanite took over the planet, becoming a dictator,

402
00:38:23,563 --> 00:38:29,304
placing a majority of Earth's heroes under suspended
animation and forming new futuristic cities.

403
00:38:29,824 --> 00:38:35,371
With help from a time traveling hour man, however,
Ultra Humanite lost his connection to the Thunderbolt,

404
00:38:35,891 --> 00:38:40,655
and in his human form was shot through the brain
by the Crimson Avenger. You can learn more

405
00:38:40,675 --> 00:38:46,840
about our man in his duel against Bishop of
the X-Men. Ultrahumanite's mind survived, however,

406
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:52,825
within a stolen copy of a helmet worn by Mento,
a former psychic member of the Doom Patrol,

407
00:38:53,005 --> 00:38:59,511
and he eventually became a recurring foe of
Power Girl, aka Karen Starr, who seemingly

408
00:38:59,571 --> 00:39:05,991
helped reform Ultrahumanite by helping clone
young and sustainable version of his Gerard

409
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:12,135
Shugal body. In post-Flashpoint continuity,
for a time, Ultra Humanite was reimagined as

410
00:39:12,175 --> 00:39:17,098
an alien shapeshifting prisoner of the Phantom
Zone capable of feeding on the emotions of

411
00:39:17,238 --> 00:39:22,481
others, though this was retconned and Ultra
Humanite returned to his albino gorilla form.

412
00:39:22,941 --> 00:39:28,344
It was revealed that Gerard Shugal had a daughter
named Laura, a criminal scientist who married

413
00:39:28,404 --> 00:39:33,756
a fellow scientist named Winston Shen. both
of whom aided the Ultra-Humanite in his villainous

414
00:39:33,796 --> 00:39:39,380
endeavors. Fifteen years ago, the Ultra-Humanite
attempted to open a portal to the Phantom Zone,

415
00:39:39,481 --> 00:39:43,764
where he knew the Monkey King was trapped, in
an effort to force him to be his henchman.

416
00:39:44,144 --> 00:39:48,628
Though Ultra's plan was foiled by the Justice
League, one of the Monkey King's hairs escaped

417
00:39:48,688 --> 00:39:53,712
the Phantom Zone disguised as a baby, who was
adopted by Laura and Winston, and eventually

418
00:39:53,732 --> 00:39:58,536
became the hero, the Monkey Prince, who you
can learn more about in our Monkey Prince vs.

419
00:39:58,616 --> 00:40:04,500
Mantis duel episode. Ultra later teamed up with
Gorilla Grodd and Monsieur Malat to take over

420
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:09,723
the cities of Bloodhaven and Gorilla City, who
the Monkey Prince and Detective Chimp teamed

421
00:40:09,823 --> 00:40:15,666
up to stop them. And that's Ultra Humanite's
backstory so far. Powers-wise, Ultra Humanite's

422
00:40:15,706 --> 00:40:21,629
powerful psychic mind grants him telepathy and
telekinesis, and his genius-level intellect

423
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:28,052
allows him to create advanced technology, including
weaponry such as laser cannons, portal generators,

424
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:34,404
and pain-inducing nanites. but also body switching
tech, which has allowed his brain to inhabit

425
00:40:34,424 --> 00:40:40,347
the form of a genetically enhanced gorilla,
granting him enhanced strength, speed, agility,

426
00:40:40,627 --> 00:40:46,470
and durability. Ultrahumanite has also proven
extremely difficult to kill due to his ability

427
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:52,293
to transfer his consciousness, sometimes just
via his telepathy alone, into others or one

428
00:40:52,334 --> 00:40:56,996
of his genetically enhanced gorilla clones.
And that's the ultrahumanite. Literally what

429
00:40:57,016 --> 00:41:02,587
makes this guy any different from Gorilla Grodd?
He's a lot smarter than Gorilla Grodd. They

430
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:07,869
both have telepathy and telekinesis, but Ultra
Humanite tends to bring advanced weaponry and

431
00:41:07,889 --> 00:41:14,131
firepower. Doesn't Gorilla Grodd also use advanced
tech in his battles? Yeah, I guess. I'm just

432
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:17,913
trying to understand why you even need Ultra
Humanite in the DC universe if you already

433
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:23,635
have Grodd. The characters seem way too similar
for them to both exist. I think if it came

434
00:41:23,695 --> 00:41:29,677
down to it, Ultra Humanite would stomp Gorilla
Grodd though, because he's just way smarter.

435
00:41:30,434 --> 00:41:34,118
This Gorilla Garage copy is going down, that's
all I know. There's no way he's gonna stand

436
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:38,803
a chance against Mr. Sinister. Okay, well what
do you know? You sound extremely confident

437
00:41:38,843 --> 00:41:44,209
for someone whose character is about to get
their ass beat. We shall see.

Visit dynamicpodcast.com where we settle the
debate and settle the score.

445
00:42:38,666 --> 00:42:42,467
Now that we've got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

446
00:42:42,507 --> 00:42:48,870
of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not this speculation,

447
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:55,052
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could
play out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?

448
00:42:55,913 --> 00:42:59,914
Well, I should say there are no rules, other
than the characters have no prior knowledge

449
00:42:59,934 --> 00:43:04,336
of the other going into the fight. All they
are aware of starting out is that the other

450
00:43:04,376 --> 00:43:09,442
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.
For the speculation... contestants will begin

451
00:43:09,482 --> 00:43:14,546
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript
environment that will have no bearing on the

452
00:43:14,586 --> 00:43:19,931
match itself, as no environmental statistics
are considered in my simulations. The contestants

453
00:43:19,971 --> 00:43:24,975
must earn victory on their own merit." Alright
then let's get into it. Ultra Humanite and

454
00:43:25,015 --> 00:43:29,959
Mr. Sinister meet on the battlefield. Who goes
first? I feel like it's hard to say who would

455
00:43:29,999 --> 00:43:36,604
go first since they both seem so calculating.
But I think Ultra Humanite is like, you know,

456
00:43:36,644 --> 00:43:42,403
he's an 800 pound mass. of genetically enhanced
gorilla badassery. So I'm going to say he goes

457
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:49,865
first and he's going to start by straight up
charging Mr. Sinister during which he activates

458
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:56,847
a gadget that encases him in an energy field
as he rolls into Mr. Sinister Donkey Kong style,

459
00:43:57,308 --> 00:44:04,274
just crashing into him and vaporizing him on
contact. What is he like Blanka? Exactly. Okay,

460
00:44:04,974 --> 00:44:09,195
um, but Mr. Sinister is going to throw up a
telekinetic force field and Ultra Humanite

461
00:44:09,215 --> 00:44:14,456
just bounces off of that. So yeah, he doesn't
get hit. Okay. But, you know, he's an agile

462
00:44:14,496 --> 00:44:21,038
gorilla. So without missing a beat, Ultra Humanite
is going to land on the ground and fling his

463
00:44:21,198 --> 00:44:27,300
gadget at Mr. Sinister, using it to trap him
in an energy bubble, at which point he's going

464
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:32,501
to pull out a remote that's going to allow him
to zap Mr. Sinister with millions of volts

465
00:44:32,521 --> 00:44:38,127
of electricity. while in that bubble. That's
a pretty good starting move. Maybe I shouldn't

466
00:44:38,147 --> 00:44:43,809
have called him a Grilla Grot copy. Yeah, yeah,
maybe shouldn't have. Okay, so Sinister is

467
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:50,451
stuck in this energy sphere and he's being electrocuted.
I'm gonna say he just reaches out telepathically

468
00:44:50,511 --> 00:44:55,832
to mentally force Ultra Humanite to depower
the energy field. No, that's not gonna work.

469
00:44:56,172 --> 00:45:01,442
Mr. Sinister is gonna try to mind control Ultra
Humanite. and you know he's only gonna end

470
00:45:01,502 --> 00:45:08,365
up with searing brain pain because of Ultra's
telepathic shielding. Okay, so then he reaches

471
00:45:08,425 --> 00:45:13,367
out telekinetically then and he shoots out this
powerful concussive force blast from his hands

472
00:45:13,707 --> 00:45:19,630
that smashes Ultra Humanite's energy field device
and it's also gonna send the Big Ape just flying

473
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:25,092
backward. So Mr. Sinister is free from the energy
field now and I think he's probably gonna want

474
00:45:25,112 --> 00:45:30,707
to get his genetic sample of Ultra Humanite.
so that he can study him after the match. So

475
00:45:30,747 --> 00:45:36,409
he's going for blood, you know? He's gonna reach
his hands down toward the ground and just telekinetically

476
00:45:36,589 --> 00:45:42,252
break the floor apart in a small circle around
him. And he's gonna lift some of that debris

477
00:45:42,432 --> 00:45:48,174
as small shards that he just launches at Ultra
Humanite and they slash through him and just

478
00:45:48,194 --> 00:45:54,297
spill his blood onto the battlefield. I mean,
that would have to be some very sharp stone

479
00:45:54,337 --> 00:45:58,975
shrapnel. Like, Ultra Humanite's durable enough
to take blows from Superman and Power Girl.

480
00:45:59,335 --> 00:46:05,398
They're sharp. They're sharp. Okay. Alright,
uh, so Ultra, you know, he gets tagged by a

481
00:46:05,438 --> 00:46:12,021
few sharp pebbles, I guess. Big whoop. He's
gonna respond by whooping out this huge-ass

482
00:46:12,201 --> 00:46:19,384
laser cannon, and he's gonna fire, like, a massive
disintegration beam at Mr. Sinister, just disintegrating

483
00:46:19,424 --> 00:46:23,798
him. No, the laser beam just goes through Mr.
Sinister. It, like, it, like... permeates him

484
00:46:23,938 --> 00:46:29,103
like if he were made out of liquid, you know,
and the hole that it creates in Mr. Sinister's

485
00:46:29,223 --> 00:46:36,489
chest just seals immediately once the laser
stops and at that point Mr. Sinister is gonna

486
00:46:36,509 --> 00:46:42,054
throw out this device that looks like a red
ruby thing and it floats midair before opening

487
00:46:42,154 --> 00:46:48,980
up to expel several like red and black blobs
is what it looks like but those take shape

488
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:54,475
as Mr. Sinister clones. So now there's like
four Mr. Sinisters on the battlefield. What?

489
00:46:54,816 --> 00:46:59,378
And they're all gonna smile like really creepily
at Ultra Humanite with their black eyes and

490
00:46:59,418 --> 00:47:04,161
sharp teeth, you know? Uh, and then at that
point, they're all just gonna simultaneously

491
00:47:04,281 --> 00:47:08,924
blast Ultra Humanite with lasers from their
foreheads. So like Ultra Humanite's getting

492
00:47:08,944 --> 00:47:14,847
hit from all directions now. And Ultra Humanite's
probably like, what the shit? So as he's, you

493
00:47:14,867 --> 00:47:20,518
know, getting blasted, that's when he quickly
pushes a button on his suit. and that's going

494
00:47:20,558 --> 00:47:26,981
to instantly inflate a mini like zeppelin like
vessel, like a blimp around him. And so he's

495
00:47:27,001 --> 00:47:32,825
going to rise into the air with shielding that
blocks the lasers. So while he's in the ship,

496
00:47:32,845 --> 00:47:37,627
you know, trying to buy all these buttons, he's
going to hit one of them and the zeppelin is

497
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:43,591
going to emit a purple gas and it's going to
spew out of its ventilation. And the sinister

498
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:48,173
clones are going to breathe that in and it's
going to start breaking down their bodies.

499
00:47:48,213 --> 00:47:54,270
They just start falling apart from this purple
plague. A zeppelin? Yeah. That seems very not

500
00:47:54,350 --> 00:48:02,956
high tech. It's a very high tech blimp. Okay.
So the sinister clones get poisoned. Maybe

501
00:48:03,036 --> 00:48:08,120
only one of them falls apart due to this purple
gas, but the gas actually gets blown away by

502
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,883
one of the other clones who transforms his arms
into like this giant paddle that just fans

503
00:48:12,903 --> 00:48:18,226
the gas away from them. And then the other clone.
He's gonna fly up to the zeppelin. He just

504
00:48:18,326 --> 00:48:23,649
rips that thing open by turning his hand into
a sword and flying across it. And while that's

505
00:48:23,689 --> 00:48:29,951
all happening, the real Mr. Sinister, he's going
to collect the blood sample from ultra humanite

506
00:48:29,971 --> 00:48:35,434
that's on the ground. And he's going to mix
it in this glass vial that he then loads into

507
00:48:35,654 --> 00:48:42,397
an injection gun. Okay. Well, okay. So Ultra's
ship is going down. So he's going to eject

508
00:48:42,517 --> 00:48:48,787
out of it armed with a. Nanite dart launcher
that looks like a high tech crossbow and he's

509
00:48:48,807 --> 00:48:54,690
going to fire a dart at the sword wielding sinister
clone And it's going to penetrate him and just

510
00:48:54,750 --> 00:49:01,672
explode him from within at which point the dart
is then going to track the fan wielding sinister

511
00:49:02,193 --> 00:49:08,115
zip into him and blow him up too and Finally
it's going to go to the real mr. Sinister and

512
00:49:08,135 --> 00:49:13,357
blow him up. No that darts never going to reach
mr. Sinister He just like telekinetically smacks

513
00:49:13,377 --> 00:49:18,733
it out of the air real easy and then he's gonna
stretch his arm over to ultra humanite once

514
00:49:18,793 --> 00:49:23,956
the gorilla lands on the ground and he's gonna
inject him with this injection gun dosing him

515
00:49:24,036 --> 00:49:31,461
with this genetically modifying serum that's
gonna basically just turn the ape into just

516
00:49:31,481 --> 00:49:36,845
a regular old ape, you know, without like psychic
powers or anything so the ape is just gonna

517
00:49:36,905 --> 00:49:42,349
stand there scratching his butt or whatever
and at which point Mr. Sinister telepathically

518
00:49:42,409 --> 00:49:48,420
erases his brain killing him and then he's gonna
experiment on the body match over wait so he

519
00:49:48,481 --> 00:49:56,006
kills an innocent monkey like humanely he wipes
his mind it's humane it's fine okay not that

520
00:49:56,046 --> 00:50:02,390
mr. sinister would care about that that's probably
fair um but removing the genetic modifications

521
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:10,619
to Ultra's eighth body would not eliminate Ultra's
powerful mind It would probably cause his eighth

522
00:50:10,759 --> 00:50:16,201
body to age rapidly because it can't contain
his mind. So, you know, Ultra realizes that

523
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:20,923
he's going to need to abandon this body. And
so he's going to smash open a tiny capsule

524
00:50:20,963 --> 00:50:26,966
on the ground before his body completely withers.
At which point, a tiny ant that was within

525
00:50:26,986 --> 00:50:32,808
the capsule rapidly grows to human size. And
it's equipped with a headband that allows Ultra

526
00:50:33,088 --> 00:50:39,700
to psychically transfer his mind into it. And
this ant is also strapped with an ice cannon

527
00:50:40,301 --> 00:50:46,065
that Ultra uses to freeze Mr. Sinister before
telekinetically just slamming him into the

528
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:52,430
ground and causing his body to shatter into
thousands of pieces, like T-1000 style, match

529
00:50:52,510 --> 00:50:58,575
over. What is he, Ant-Man? Where'd the ant come
from? He's been an ant in the comics before.

530
00:50:58,935 --> 00:51:04,127
Really? Yeah. That's stupid. I mean, he can't
transfer his mind if he doesn't have psychic

531
00:51:04,167 --> 00:51:10,170
powers. The serum that he was injected with
removed his psychic powers. Dude, how the psychic

532
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:16,293
powers aren't linked to the Apes genetic enhancements?
Because I said so. That's how it was a power

533
00:51:16,353 --> 00:51:22,536
negating formula. All powers are gone. All right.
Well, that's probably a good place to leave

534
00:51:22,596 --> 00:51:29,613
it either. Mr. Sinister. removed all of Ultra
Humanite's powers including his mental powers,

535
00:51:29,793 --> 00:51:36,038
preventing him from transferring minds before
dying. Or in a more badass version, Ultra Humanite

536
00:51:36,059 --> 00:51:41,963
becomes an ice cannon wielding ant that just
shatters Mr. Sinister. That seems more like

537
00:51:41,983 --> 00:51:47,508
the wacky version than the badass version. It
could be both. But we'll go ahead and leave

538
00:51:47,528 --> 00:51:51,331
our speculation there, let's enter the stats
and run the simulations before coming back

539
00:51:51,451 --> 00:51:59,558
with a winner. AJ9K, hit it! Inputting data,
running calculations, processing results, simulations

540
00:51:59,598 --> 00:52:05,543
complete. All right, these guys are more even
than my shit talking would have you believe.

541
00:52:05,884 --> 00:52:11,589
On one hand, you have Mr. Sinister, who is highly
evasive. As a matter of fact, that was the

542
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:16,634
biggest discrepancy between these two characters.
You know, given the fact that Mr. Sinister

543
00:52:16,774 --> 00:52:21,202
has complete control over every molecule in
his body, he can make himself permeable. He

544
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:25,845
can make himself indestructible in addition
to the telepathic and telekinetic shielding

545
00:52:25,885 --> 00:52:31,289
he can generate. Yeah, Ultra Humanite has the
shielding, but in my research I found out he

546
00:52:31,309 --> 00:52:36,552
doesn't use it as often in his ape form as he
did when he was like in his Dolores Winters

547
00:52:36,592 --> 00:52:42,496
form. Because he's pretty durable and can basically
tank hits from Superman, Power Girl, Martian

548
00:52:42,516 --> 00:52:48,681
Manhunter. So yeah, he's definitely less evasive.
He is slightly more durable, we said though,

549
00:52:48,921 --> 00:52:53,243
than Mr. Sinister. Yeah, Ultra Humanite was
able to compensate not only with durability

550
00:52:53,263 --> 00:52:59,165
but also his strength and damage. Strength makes
sense because Mr. Sinister is only around class

551
00:52:59,205 --> 00:53:04,948
10 whereas Ultra Humanite can go toe to toe
with the likes of DC's heaviest hitters, but

552
00:53:05,108 --> 00:53:10,530
damage was interesting. Mr. Sinister doesn't
usually employ citywide destroying methods

553
00:53:10,731 --> 00:53:14,852
in a lot of his schemes, you know, they're a
lot more subtle than that usually, whereas

554
00:53:14,992 --> 00:53:20,139
Ultra Humanite seems capable of mass destruction.
Yeah, he has no qualms about busting out huge

555
00:53:20,179 --> 00:53:24,482
ass weapons in his battles. It's kind of his
thing. We also said that Ultra Humanite was

556
00:53:24,542 --> 00:53:30,647
slightly more intelligent than Mr. Sinister,
which I thought was bullshit. I'm calling bullshit.

557
00:53:30,667 --> 00:53:35,410
We argued so long about this, guys. And I don't
want the Marvel guys to come at me saying like,

558
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:40,954
oh, you must not really know how smart Mr. Sinister
is. Oh, I do. I know how smart Mr. Sinister

559
00:53:41,054 --> 00:53:47,342
is. He's also the guy that wasn't able to cure
the legacy virus where Beast did. Whereas Ultra

560
00:53:47,382 --> 00:53:53,688
Humanite, I guess, is touted as being smarter
than Lex Luthor. Yes. It's said he's like twice

561
00:53:53,728 --> 00:53:58,773
as smart as Lex Luthor, who claims to be the
smartest man on the planet. So. Well, I mean,

562
00:53:58,873 --> 00:54:04,198
I would put Mr. Sinister at Lex Luthor's intelligence
level easily. I just think maybe Jonathan is

563
00:54:04,258 --> 00:54:09,903
cheating and the whole being smarter than Lex
Luthor thing is just a statement of hyperbole

564
00:54:10,103 --> 00:54:15,462
on behalf of the villain himself just claiming
that. He was like the original mad scientist.

565
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:21,984
Like he was Lex Luthor before Lex Luthor was.
And I mean, his feats may not be comparable

566
00:54:22,004 --> 00:54:26,965
to Lex Luthor in terms of success, but he also
has some pretty incredible feats on his own

567
00:54:27,225 --> 00:54:32,867
when it comes to like his inventiveness. I guess
we've never seen Lex Luthor transfer his mind

568
00:54:32,927 --> 00:54:38,549
into an ant that grows and shoots an ice cannon
or something. It's just wacky. It's wacky shit.

569
00:54:38,629 --> 00:54:43,426
That's like Mr. Fantastic type shit. Yeah, exactly.
In terms of versatility, like both of these

570
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:49,028
guys are off the charts. Mr. Sinister went accounting
for his psychic abilities, his shape-shifting

571
00:54:49,049 --> 00:54:54,451
abilities, his engineering abilities, the tech
and gadgets that he brings into battle. You

572
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:58,712
know, he's as versatile as they come. Same thing
with Ultra Humanite because they have a similar

573
00:54:58,752 --> 00:55:02,914
power set. Although Ultra Humanite doesn't have
the shape-shifting. So with all that said,

574
00:55:03,334 --> 00:55:07,836
Jonathan, who do you think is winning this match?
I mean Ultra Humanite, I think it's going to

575
00:55:07,856 --> 00:55:13,679
be really close. That evasiveness stat really
scares me. but I think Ultra Humanite is gonna

576
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:19,464
squeak out a win here, I hope. Well, everyone
on Instagram thinks you're dumb. I know, well,

577
00:55:19,484 --> 00:55:24,528
what else is new? 75% of people who took our
poll said that Mr. Sinister was going to win.

578
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:30,733
And of course this is a popularity contest.
Ultra Humanite was in the Justice League cartoon,

579
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:35,817
but that was in the 2000s. And I feel like our
fan base is largely kids from the 90s. So they

580
00:55:35,837 --> 00:55:40,841
grew up with Mr. Sinister in like the X-Men
cartoons. Yeah, and the X-Men cartoon is back.

581
00:55:41,082 --> 00:55:44,603
I haven't watched it yet, but I heard it's good.
And of course, we will be reviewing it when

582
00:55:44,643 --> 00:55:47,904
it finishes in about a month and a half here.
But let's go ahead and get to the results of

583
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:55,726
this match. AG 9K, the results, please. Here
you are, sir. The winner between Ultra Humanite

584
00:55:56,366 --> 00:56:07,209
and Mr. Sinister is. Ultra Humanite. Yes. Yes,
is really dumb. Fuck all the haters. It just

585
00:56:07,249 --> 00:56:13,975
makes me think that. Maybe I don't know much
about Ultra Humanite because he won 529 matches

586
00:56:14,095 --> 00:56:22,017
out of the 1000 simulations whereas Mr. Sinister
only won 47.1%. This could be a case of Jonathan

587
00:56:22,237 --> 00:56:26,899
cheating. It probably is. Oh my gosh. Just taking
a lesser known character and then making up

588
00:56:26,919 --> 00:56:31,300
a bunch of bullshit about him so that he wins.
Because no one's going to call him out on his

589
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:34,861
shit because no one knows if he's telling the
truth or not. I'm not actually the one who

590
00:56:34,901 --> 00:56:41,240
even thought of this match. goes to our executive
producer, Mickey Math and Gian. Well, he pulls

591
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:45,303
the same shit too. What? He'll pick the most
random obscure character and they'd be like,

592
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:51,847
oh, you didn't know? He's smarter than Lex Luthor.
So he gets higher on the intelligence stat.

593
00:56:52,328 --> 00:56:58,352
Stupid. I don't know what to tell you. Like
DC characters are just better. And I feel like

594
00:56:58,372 --> 00:57:03,956
you're slowly learning that fact. I'm sorry,
it hurts. The truth hurts. I'm sorry. Truth

595
00:57:03,996 --> 00:57:09,955
can also be manipulated as we saw here today,
folks. No, no, there's one truth and that is

596
00:57:10,255 --> 00:57:18,138
AJ 9k. We waited all this time to put Mr. Sinister
in a duel only to have him lose against a monkey

597
00:57:18,178 --> 00:57:24,781
who flings his own shit. I can't I can't accept
that at all. I feel bad for you. I truly do.

598
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:29,903
Like just switch to Team DC already. If you
felt that bad for me, you would change the

599
00:57:29,943 --> 00:57:33,845
results of this match so that Mr. Sinister would
win. I mean, I don't feel that bad for you.

600
00:57:34,305 --> 00:57:39,123
All right. Well, that does it for this match,
