00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,846 --> 00:00:29,249
And welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:35,073
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:35,653 --> 00:00:41,898
I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm his twin brother,
Johnny DC. And we are kicking off Spooky October.

5
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:45,400
We've never called it Spooky October before
now, but I'm just going to call it Spooky October

6
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:52,125
because we're coming at you guys with non-stop
Halloween-related duels and reviews all October

7
00:00:52,165 --> 00:00:59,126
long. culminating in what is sure to be a much
anticipated episode for our fans on Halloween

8
00:00:59,146 --> 00:01:04,571
day, October 31st. I don't wanna give away the
surprise just yet, but it's gonna be awesome.

9
00:01:05,051 --> 00:01:08,454
This episode is also gonna be awesome. We're
gonna find out who'd win in a fight between

10
00:01:08,674 --> 00:01:14,559
Andrew Bennett from the comic book, I, Vampire,
which I think is like the Apple version of

11
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:21,685
a regular vampire against fucking Dracula. Like
who's this Andrew Bennett guy compared to Dracula?

12
00:01:21,865 --> 00:01:27,241
He's nobody, that's who. You're gonna learn
today. All right. I honestly can't wait for

13
00:01:27,281 --> 00:01:31,065
this matchup. I think it's gonna be pretty cool.
No, no, no. Okay, every time you wanna use

14
00:01:31,085 --> 00:01:35,168
the word cool for the month of October, just
replace it with spooky. So say that again.

15
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:42,235
I'm looking forward to it. It's gonna be spooky.
Before we find out who'd win in a fight between

16
00:01:42,275 --> 00:01:45,718
these two characters, guys, we're gonna break
down the latest comic book movie news to come

17
00:01:45,758 --> 00:01:53,211
out from the past week, including some threads
from James Gunn confirming. new DCU canon info.

18
00:01:53,271 --> 00:01:57,814
And that's basically it, kind of a slow news
week, but we're hoping for more content as

19
00:01:57,894 --> 00:02:02,536
the writer's strike and hopefully the actor's
strike soon become resolved. As always, we

But with that out of the way, quick to the

50
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:51,408
no prize. A no prize is an award Marvel used
to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic

51
00:04:51,448 --> 00:04:56,791
Dual No Prize, is a digital award we post on
Instagram and in our email newsletter for the

52
00:04:56,831 --> 00:05:01,513
person that we feel gave the best answer to
our question of the week. Last week's question

53
00:05:01,553 --> 00:05:07,997
was, what has been the most underrated Marvel
or DC TV show in your opinion and why? And

54
00:05:08,017 --> 00:05:13,780
that was coming off of the final trailer for
the last half of Doom Patrol Season 4, which

55
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,802
Jonathan and I view as a highly underrated show.
You guys reached out with your opinions, let's

56
00:05:18,842 --> 00:05:23,763
go ahead and run down our honorable mentions
as well as the no prize winner. Our first honorable

57
00:05:23,803 --> 00:05:30,105
mention goes to Travis Bailey who said, Travis
Bailey, I love the Travis Bailey, shout out

58
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:36,007
to my good twin. Marvel all day, could have
won with MoDoc, could have won with Lucky Man

59
00:05:36,207 --> 00:05:40,868
on Shutter, check it out. But I'm going with
Black Panther, the animated series, limited

60
00:05:40,928 --> 00:05:48,347
run, like six episodes on BET, had everything.
You had X-Men. Young T'Challa meeting Storm,

61
00:05:48,767 --> 00:05:54,889
The Fall of Wakanda. It's a beautiful show.
Yeah, y'all should check it out. Yeah, Travis

62
00:05:54,929 --> 00:06:00,512
Bailey was kind enough to let us know that we
miscited one of the answers from last week

63
00:06:00,532 --> 00:06:06,214
that was actually given by Travis Herndon. And
we said Travis Bailey. Sorry to Travis Herndon

64
00:06:06,414 --> 00:06:11,016
for that. But apparently you and Travis Bailey
are now twins. And we will address you as such.

65
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:19,073
But no, the Black Panther. Animated show that
came out on BET was an adaptation of the first

66
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:24,457
arc of the Black Panther series that was written
by Famous Hollywood writer and director Reginald

67
00:06:24,497 --> 00:06:30,721
Hudlin. It was essentially a motion comic The
animation wasn't quite that robust, but it

68
00:06:30,741 --> 00:06:36,145
was a fantastic story You know Reginald did
so much for the lore of Wakanda and the character

69
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:40,087
of Black Panther a lot of which was actually
used in the Black Panther movie such as the

70
00:06:40,147 --> 00:06:45,683
contest between Wakandans over who gets to be
the Black Panther. A lot of great stuff there.

71
00:06:46,143 --> 00:06:50,066
Yeah, I'd never heard of this series before.
I didn't know this existed, but it's really

72
00:06:50,086 --> 00:06:55,230
cool to hear how influential it was on the character.
Yeah, yeah, it's definitely a quintessential

73
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:00,794
classic Black Panther arc. Great answer, Travis.
Our next honorable mention goes to Jacob Bell,

74
00:07:01,094 --> 00:07:06,838
who said, Hey, what's up, guys? This is Jacob.
Um, I think the most underrated show that I

75
00:07:06,858 --> 00:07:12,822
have seen is probably Gotham. I think Gotham's
a really good show. I don't know why. It got

76
00:07:12,842 --> 00:07:19,623
all the hate. I think it's a fun idea, fun concept,
and the lead, the guy who plays Jim Gordon

77
00:07:19,804 --> 00:07:23,705
is really good, and the kid who played Bruce
Wayne is also really good. So yeah, Gotham.

78
00:07:23,805 --> 00:07:27,286
I think it's great. I think it's a really good
show. Yeah, I guess you could consider Gotham

79
00:07:27,346 --> 00:07:32,107
underrated. It's kind of hard to justify that
maybe considering that it was a network show

80
00:07:32,127 --> 00:07:38,369
that I think was mostly popular, even though
Jacob's right, it did get shit upon quite frequently

81
00:07:38,549 --> 00:07:43,775
on the internet. I didn't actually watch the
entire series. But what I did see, I thought

82
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:51,001
was fairly well done. Just seeing these iconic
Batman villains in like their proto forms,

83
00:07:51,121 --> 00:07:55,344
like for the Penguin, for the Riddler, for the
Joker, all these different characters, it was

84
00:07:55,384 --> 00:07:59,808
just exciting to see. I don't know, I saw some
episodes too and the acting didn't look that

85
00:07:59,868 --> 00:08:05,012
great. Maybe for like the main characters, but
I mean it's a CW, so it's a step up from soap

86
00:08:05,052 --> 00:08:12,854
opera acting, right? This wasn't a CW, this
was Fox. What? Yeah. Oh, total mind blow. Statement

87
00:08:12,934 --> 00:08:17,938
still applies. It was a WB produced show, so,
you know. I don't know, I mean, I guess you

88
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:22,141
could say some of the characters got kind of
hammy, but it's not like it was fucking the

89
00:08:22,181 --> 00:08:28,125
60s Batman series or anything like that. It
was decent. Production value was good. Thanks,

90
00:08:28,165 --> 00:08:33,669
Jacob Bell, for the answer. Our final honorable
mention goes to Peter Troll, who said. Hey

91
00:08:33,689 --> 00:08:40,206
guys, it's Peter Troll. I just want to say the
most underrated Marvel TV show. Might have

92
00:08:40,226 --> 00:08:45,487
to be Spider-Man the new animated series. It
gets so much hate because of how goofy it looks,

93
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:50,669
but if you can get past the way it looks, it's
got a great story and it rides the coattails

94
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:55,570
of the Sam Raimi trilogy, and it's just got
a lot of great details and stuff that were

95
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:59,812
made for adults, and it's just a good watch
overall and deserves to be watched more often.

96
00:08:59,992 --> 00:09:05,433
Thanks guys. Yeah, thanks Peter Troll. The Spider-Man
the new animated series is an often overlooked

97
00:09:05,493 --> 00:09:12,255
animated series. because it only had one season.
It ran in the summer of 2003, which is actually

98
00:09:12,355 --> 00:09:17,857
in between the first Sam Raimi Spider-Man movie
and Spider-Man 2. And it kind of branched off

99
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:24,900
from the story of the first film in its own
alternate universe type situation is how it

100
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:29,521
could be perceived today because it definitely
doesn't lead into the events of Spider-Man

101
00:09:29,561 --> 00:09:34,724
2. But it was cool for its time, you know, it
was on MTV. Jonathan and I definitely watched

102
00:09:34,764 --> 00:09:39,267
this as kids. You know, it may date us. The
fact that we watched the shit out of the show

103
00:09:39,507 --> 00:09:44,470
as it came out. Yeah, I liked Neil Patrick Harris
in the role. I thought the show was cool. Yeah,

104
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,132
and it had pretty interesting takes on characters
like the lizard. And I remember Michael Clarke

105
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:54,616
Duncan did the voice for the kingpin. Right.
And he had just got off of his role as the

106
00:09:54,656 --> 00:10:00,094
kingpin in the 2003 Daredevil movie starring
Ben Affleck. So it almost felt like a crossover,

107
00:10:00,114 --> 00:10:04,917
like a bridge between the Spider-Man movies
and the Daredevil film, which was pretty cool.

108
00:10:05,377 --> 00:10:09,860
Yeah, it was like a cinematic universe before
a cinematic universe was a thing. You're right,

109
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:16,404
exactly. I bet you if I were to revisit this
show now though, it would look horrible. Probably.

110
00:10:16,944 --> 00:10:21,486
I remember the animation being pretty stiff
back in the day, so it would look extra weird

111
00:10:21,526 --> 00:10:26,269
now. But great answer, Peter. We wanna give
a quick shout out to Scott Camacho and Mitchell

112
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:32,464
Smoothie. for taking the time to visit our website
and record an answer. But the winner of this

113
00:10:32,504 --> 00:10:37,766
week's No Prize is... Eric Jones, who said...
What up, what up, what up, it's Eric Jones

114
00:10:37,786 --> 00:10:42,869
and I think the most underrated DC Marvel TV
show is The Big Green Hero and I'm not talking

115
00:10:42,929 --> 00:10:49,231
about Arrow, I'm talking about M.F.N. Swamp
Thing. The show had everything that I think

116
00:10:49,251 --> 00:10:54,766
you could want in a Swamp Thing based material
show. It had horror. comic book action, it

117
00:10:54,786 --> 00:11:00,171
had different heroes from the Justice League
Dark, it set up perfectly for a season 2 and

118
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:05,596
or Justice League Dark show, and it got taken
away from us way too soon. Swamp Thing's the

119
00:11:05,636 --> 00:11:11,902
way. The Swamp Thing show is so damn good, it
did not deserve to be canceled the way it was

120
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:17,487
before the first season even wrapped its final
episode. It was done so dirty for as good as

121
00:11:17,507 --> 00:11:22,490
it was. Not only were the special effects really
good, But just like the horror elements that

122
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:27,473
they introduced and the writing and the acting,
all top notch. Plus you got Easter eggs from

123
00:11:27,513 --> 00:11:32,916
characters like Blue Devil and Madame Xanadu.
It was such a cool show to watch. Not enough

124
00:11:32,956 --> 00:11:38,499
people have seen it. And it's actually really
hard to see today. It's not on any streaming

125
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,882
service that I'm aware of. If you want to see
it, you actually have to buy it, like digitally.

126
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:47,845
Yeah, the series debuted on the DC Universe
app back when that was a thing. Right. And

127
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:53,969
I know that they... ran the shows on the CW
network that were like toned down. But I've

128
00:11:54,009 --> 00:11:57,452
always been interested in watching this show.
I'm really upset that we did a review at the

129
00:11:57,472 --> 00:12:02,076
time that it came out because we weren't doing
shows back then until we quickly realized,

130
00:12:02,497 --> 00:12:07,241
hey, you know, DC Marvel are actually putting
out great shows on these platforms. We should

131
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:11,304
start reviewing them. Yeah, this was definitely
one of the shows that inspired us to start

132
00:12:11,344 --> 00:12:16,689
reviewing streaming content. And one of these
days, maybe we will revisit Swamp Thing and

133
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:21,480
review season one. I would love that. I mean,
that would be like the least listened to episode

134
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,284
of all time because no one's going to be able
to watch it, but I would still love to do it.

135
00:12:26,624 --> 00:12:31,067
So great answer, Eric Jones. Congrats on winning
this week's no prize. If you the listener want

136
00:12:31,107 --> 00:12:34,970
a shot at winning your own no prize, stay tuned
to later on this episode when we'll be asking

137
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:39,113
another question of the week. And now that that's
done, on to the news.

138
00:12:44,686 --> 00:12:51,249
Okay, so many people, especially DC fans, have
been kind of confused when it comes to the

139
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:56,972
new cinematic universe that James Gunn is setting
up, primarily because of how the Flash movie

140
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:03,255
ended. Initially, since that film was set up
sort of like Flashpoint in the comics, which

141
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:08,182
rebooted DC's continuity, everyone, including
myself, thought that- the Flash was going to

142
00:13:08,242 --> 00:13:13,203
lead into James Gunn's new universe. But in
scheduling DC's movies for this year, Blue

143
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:18,945
Beetle and Aquaman ended up coming out after
the Flash. So it's always been kind of a question

144
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:25,247
as to when James Gunn's DC universe is going
to start. Well, we learned last Wednesday from

145
00:13:25,307 --> 00:13:32,069
James Gunn on Threads, right after the Rider
Strike ended, that DCU continuity will start

146
00:13:32,129 --> 00:13:38,464
with the max animated series. Creature Commandos
that comes out next year. Gunn described Creature

147
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:44,469
Commandos as an aperitif or an appetizer to
the real meat of canon that really begins with

148
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:50,353
Superman Legacy scheduled to be released in
2025. So for a lot of fans like myself who

149
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:55,017
were kind of confused by James Gunn's early
statement saying that, you know, Blue Beetle

150
00:13:55,277 --> 00:14:01,501
was the DCU's first character, but Superman
Legacy is the DCU's first film, now we know.

151
00:14:01,866 --> 00:14:08,008
when the DCU actually starts. We also learned
from James Gunn on threads that Sholo Mariduena,

152
00:14:08,308 --> 00:14:14,851
John Cena, and Viola Davis would be reprising
their roles in the DCU. The dude needs to make

153
00:14:14,871 --> 00:14:19,613
up his mind. Like first he's like, oh yeah,
Blue Beetle's the first DCU character. And

154
00:14:19,653 --> 00:14:24,736
it turns out that, yeah, that might be the case,
but is it like an alternate universe version

155
00:14:24,876 --> 00:14:30,126
of Blue Beetle that's gonna be played by the
same actor? What's going on here? I mean, technically

156
00:14:30,146 --> 00:14:35,787
you could say that Viola Davis's Amanda Waller
is the first DCU character since she was the

157
00:14:35,867 --> 00:14:41,829
first one to be cast way back when. Right, in
Suicide Squad, which came out in 2016. So this

158
00:14:41,869 --> 00:14:48,271
is all still confusing as hell. And James Gunn
is not clearing up anything. And he kind of

159
00:14:48,311 --> 00:14:54,173
wrote off fan confusion as like, oh, I understand
that people want to understand what's going

160
00:14:54,313 --> 00:14:59,076
on. But you know. It'll all be made clear. I
honestly don't think it'll all be made clear.

161
00:14:59,116 --> 00:15:04,340
I think fans are honestly gonna have to kind
of figure shit out for themselves, wherein

162
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:10,725
it's determined that the DCU is just an alternate
universe of the DCEU. Where basically things

163
00:15:10,745 --> 00:15:15,089
are pretty much the same except, you know, Superman
is younger and looks different and Batman too.

164
00:15:15,109 --> 00:15:20,253
I don't know if I would consider this like a
alternate universe of the DCEU. I don't know

165
00:15:20,273 --> 00:15:25,016
what to make of it, honestly. But I mean, James
Gunn does tell me that it's okay to be confused

166
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:31,141
on what's happening in the DCU since no one
has seen anything from the DCU yet. To that,

167
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:37,266
I just have to reply, well, you said that Sholo
Mariduña is returning as Blue Beetle. So, I

168
00:15:37,306 --> 00:15:43,592
mean, I feel like I have seen something from
the DCU in Blue Beetle, in Peacemaker, in the

169
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:49,216
Suicide Squad. I am confused. It's very confusing.
I don't think it's okay to be confused. I think

170
00:15:49,336 --> 00:15:54,350
confusion does not breed. brand loyalty, which
is really what DC needs at this point. I think

171
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:58,272
instead of saying it's okay to be confused,
he should have said, it's like, okay to be

172
00:15:58,352 --> 00:16:03,333
patient. Cause I don't mind being patient. I
know a lot of the internet is not like everyone

173
00:16:03,393 --> 00:16:09,575
wants everything all at once, but yeah, I'll
wait for answers. I just hope that those answers

174
00:16:09,615 --> 00:16:14,976
are freaking amazing, but it's hard to feel
like they're going to be considering that I

175
00:16:15,056 --> 00:16:19,877
sort of feel this was the worst approach to
take with the new cinematic universe. Like

176
00:16:19,997 --> 00:16:26,492
either, continue what was there before or freaking
burn it all to the ground and start from scratch.

177
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:32,376
That's much more easily digestible for audiences
and fans than what we're getting. Like I feel

178
00:16:32,456 --> 00:16:38,279
really bad for Jason Momoa because there was
not a single mention of Aquaman in James Gunn's

179
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:43,302
thread, tweets, threads, whatever you want to
call them. And it kind of feeds into the naysayers

180
00:16:43,802 --> 00:16:51,398
that maybe the Aquaman sequel isn't too important
to watch. Man, it must suck to be a DC I'm

181
00:16:51,638 --> 00:16:57,502
so glad that I'm not one of those. I just kind
of want this year to be over so that we could

182
00:16:57,522 --> 00:17:02,845
get the Joker sequel. Because I know that's
going to be good. Yeah, yeah. Hopefully. It

183
00:17:02,886 --> 00:17:08,009
is a musical, so we'll see. Oh, you're one of
those people, huh? OK. But considering the

184
00:17:08,049 --> 00:17:14,393
fact that James Gunn has confirmed that at least
some prior actors are returning to this universe,

185
00:17:14,613 --> 00:17:20,137
hopefully some storylines are also making the
jump. And that brings us to our question of

186
00:17:20,157 --> 00:17:20,417
the week.

187
00:17:25,014 --> 00:17:32,380
Which prior DC film or television series would
you most hope remained in James Gunn's DCU

188
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:40,146
continuity, and why? And this is besides projects
like Blue Beetle, Peacemaker, and the Suicide

189
00:17:40,186 --> 00:17:44,911
Squad which are already confirmed by Gunn to
be making that leap in transition to the DCU.

195
00:18:16,718 --> 00:18:19,842
But I think that does it for all the news for
this week, so let's go ahead and get into the

196
00:18:19,903 --> 00:18:25,872
main event of this episode, which is going to
be a spooky fun fight between the vampires

197
00:18:26,012 --> 00:18:28,997
of Andrew Bennett and Dracula.

198
00:18:44,302 --> 00:18:49,525
All right, Andrew Bennett versus Dracula. As
I said before, they're both vampires. Andrew

199
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:54,229
Bennett is just some guy with a random ass name
that you can meet on the sidewalk anywhere

200
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:59,713
you went. He's just Andrew Bennett going up
against fucking Dracula, who is, you know,

201
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:04,356
the lord of all vampires. He's freaking jacket.
Everybody knows who Dracula is. No one knows

202
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:09,900
who Andrew Bennett is. You know why no one knows
who Andrew Bennett is? Why? Because he's freaking

203
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,932
super secretive. All right. He's also the lord
of vampires. Just, you're not supposed to know

204
00:19:15,972 --> 00:19:23,559
who he is, because he's sneaky. Allegedly, Andrew
Bennett's series called I Vampire has a super

205
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,703
popular following, and Andrew Bennett is one
of the most powerful and premier vampires in

206
00:19:28,723 --> 00:19:34,128
the DC universe. I'm calling bullshit. I'm saying
show me the receipts to those statements, because

207
00:19:34,488 --> 00:19:39,692
I am horribly naive when it comes to DC. Oh,
you're gonna get those receipts, and you're

208
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:43,690
gonna ruin your words. You're going to ruin
the day you ever talked about Andrew Bennett.

209
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:50,872
We're getting highly dramatic here, but vampires
themselves are quite dramatic characters. Oh,

210
00:19:50,932 --> 00:19:56,414
yeah. I mean, the whole story of I vampire and
Andrew Bennett is full of drama. He's not a

211
00:19:56,514 --> 00:20:02,735
superhero character. It's very much a romantic
gothic horror. Well, I almost fell asleep when

212
00:20:02,755 --> 00:20:08,017
you were explaining that. Oh, wow. I think this
backstory is going to be super interesting.

213
00:20:08,317 --> 00:20:12,578
I know everybody will stay awake for the Dracula
backstory, though. Oh yeah, I'm sure Marvel's

214
00:20:12,598 --> 00:20:17,321
version is so much better than Bram Stoker's
Dracula. Like what the hell does Marvel even

215
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:21,663
think they're doing? Like taking a classic character
and just trying to make it their own. No, it's

216
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:26,645
gonna be the same thing that DC did with Frankenstein.
Did we not do a duel between Frankenstein and

217
00:20:26,665 --> 00:20:28,766
Bloodstone? Fuck you. Exactly.

218
00:20:31,788 --> 00:20:37,711
I'm not gonna dignify that with the response.
Let's move on to AlfredJervis9000 who is going

219
00:20:37,731 --> 00:20:43,734
to explain the methodology behind our duels.
AJ9K, tell our listeners how you go about determining

220
00:20:43,774 --> 00:20:49,257
a winner in our duel matchups. Yes, of course,
sir. The way I determine a winner between the

221
00:20:49,297 --> 00:20:55,321
contestants is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations
using the characters statistics. A Monte Carlo

222
00:20:55,361 --> 00:20:59,643
simulation is a probabilistic model used to
determine outcomes through random sampling.

223
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:04,974
In this case, I randomize the statistics along
a normal distribution. as a way to simulate

224
00:21:04,994 --> 00:21:09,575
the many variables that can occur during battle.
The stat parameters are based on the official

225
00:21:09,635 --> 00:21:14,957
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters'
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat

226
00:21:14,977 --> 00:21:20,518
categories are included such as range, damage
potential, versatility and perception in order

227
00:21:20,538 --> 00:21:25,960
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.
The results of the 1000 simulations provide

228
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,361
a percentage of wins for each character. The
contestant with the higher percentage is declared

229
00:21:30,381 --> 00:21:35,667
the victor. as they have a higher probability
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,

230
00:21:36,047 --> 00:21:40,848
neither character should win 100% of the matches.
The comic book stories have shown that there's

231
00:21:40,988 --> 00:21:45,790
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so
the confidence rate of my method falls in line

232
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:50,411
with the precedents that have been established
in the source material. My mathematical simulations

233
00:21:50,451 --> 00:21:55,613
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes

234
00:21:55,653 --> 00:22:01,223
tabulated for determination of the winner. Thanks
AJ9K, before we run the simulations though,

235
00:22:01,243 --> 00:22:05,385
we'd like to break down each character's histories
and abilities before improvising a scenario

236
00:22:05,445 --> 00:22:11,429
on how we imagined one of the 1000 simulations
would play out beat for beat. And it's my turn

237
00:22:11,449 --> 00:22:17,012
to go first with the DC character's backstory,
so let me tell you all about Andrew Bennett.

238
00:22:18,093 --> 00:22:24,276
In 16th century England, Lord Andrew Bennett
was a young English nobleman and war hero who

239
00:22:24,356 --> 00:22:29,576
served in the court of Queen Elizabeth. Where
he fell in love with one of the Queen's handmaidens,

240
00:22:29,976 --> 00:22:35,780
Mary Seward, who loved Andrew in return. On
the eve of one of Andrew's business travels,

241
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:40,944
Mary begged Andrew not to leave, as she felt
that it was too dangerous for him to travel

242
00:22:41,024 --> 00:22:46,948
so late in the day. Laughing Mary off, Andrew
embarked on his trip, and sure enough that

243
00:22:47,008 --> 00:22:53,352
night, Andrew was attacked and bitten by a vampire.
Though Andrew was able to kill the vampire,

244
00:22:53,753 --> 00:22:59,428
Andrew died as well. arising three days later
with a thirst for blood. Distraught over his

245
00:22:59,488 --> 00:23:04,931
vampirism, Andrew hid, feeding on the blood
of animals until he was eventually discovered

246
00:23:05,031 --> 00:23:11,375
in his bedroom by Mary. Realizing what he had
become, Mary begged Andrew to transform her

247
00:23:11,415 --> 00:23:17,978
into a vampire as well so that they could be
together for eternity. Andrew reluctantly agreed,

248
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:23,998
and fed on Mary, killing her. When she returned
from the dead, she was a vampire. though now

249
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:31,022
completely changed and devoid of her prior humanity,
corrupted and possessing sadistic joy in feeding

250
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:37,625
on others. Mary left Andrew and developed a
reputation for herself as Mary, Queen of Blood,

251
00:23:38,006 --> 00:23:43,469
forming a secret society known as the Cult of
the Blood Red Moon with intentions of taking

252
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:49,212
over the world. Horrified and guilt-stricken
by what Mary had become and by her actions,

253
00:23:49,712 --> 00:23:54,772
Andrew dedicated his immortal life to the to
tracking Mary across the world knowing that

254
00:23:54,812 --> 00:24:00,297
he would be forced to kill his beloved Mary
once again in order to save the human race.

255
00:24:00,877 --> 00:24:06,522
Andrew gained and lost numerous allies over
the centuries in his pursuit of Mary. In the

256
00:24:06,562 --> 00:24:11,847
early 1900s, Andrew nearly caught her after
she had just killed the parents of a young

257
00:24:11,887 --> 00:24:18,273
boy named Dmitri Mishkin. Andrew rescued Dmitri
instead and raised him to become a formidable

258
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:25,508
vampire hunter. In the late 1960s, Andrew confronted
Mary at Woodstock, only for Mary to threaten

259
00:24:25,528 --> 00:24:31,090
the life of a beautiful young woman named Deborah
Dancer. Forced to save Deborah rather than

260
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:36,933
pursue Mary, Andrew confessed to Deborah his
life story and mission. Deborah joined Andrew

261
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:43,355
and Dimitri in their crusade to kill Mary and
stop her cult, eventually encountering a vampire

262
00:24:43,616 --> 00:24:49,618
that turned out to be Dimitri's mother, Dunya
Mishkin, to Dimitri's despair. Not long after,

263
00:24:49,898 --> 00:24:54,541
the trio were attacked by human agents of the
Cult of the Blood Red Moon and trapped in a

264
00:24:54,582 --> 00:25:00,325
cave-in. Andrew nearly succumbed to his bloodlust
and fed on Deborah while she was sleeping,

265
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:05,969
only for her to wake up at the last minute.
Andrew kissed her instead, realizing he was

266
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:10,512
developing romantic feelings for someone other
than Mary for the first time in hundreds of

267
00:25:10,572 --> 00:25:16,456
years. Andrew abandoned Deborah and Dimitri
to hunt Mary on his own and protect his loved

268
00:25:16,577 --> 00:25:22,355
ones from further danger. After Andrew chased
Mary on his own for some time, an old ally

269
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:28,616
of Andrew's named Edward Thrain returned seemingly
from the dead as a vampire and kidnapped Andrew

270
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:34,458
and Deborah. Andrew was able to escape and save
Deborah, however, making him realize how much

271
00:25:34,498 --> 00:25:40,280
his friends meant to him. Andrew decided to
find Dmitri and, with Deborah's help, managed

272
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:45,861
to follow him to Russia, only to learn that
Dmitri was tracking his mother, Dunya Mishkin.

273
00:25:46,334 --> 00:25:52,017
and had been transformed into a vampire himself.
Deborah attempted to kill Dunya, but accidentally

274
00:25:52,057 --> 00:25:57,680
killed Dimitri instead, who killed his mother
with the last of his strength. While in Russia,

275
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:04,063
Andrew discovered an experimental formula and
supposed a cure for vampirism, which he took,

276
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:09,186
allowing him to enjoy the pleasures of being
a man once again. After spending the night

277
00:26:09,206 --> 00:26:14,549
with Deborah, his body succumbed to rigor mortis,
allowing the cult of the blood red moon to

278
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:21,246
capture him as his body began to slowly decay.
Mary forced Andrew to watch as she transformed

279
00:26:21,327 --> 00:26:28,252
Deborah into a vampire. Deborah, having taken
the formula as well, emerged as a vampire without

280
00:26:28,393 --> 00:26:34,017
any typical vampire weaknesses, and the two
women fought to the death, culminating with

281
00:26:34,098 --> 00:26:40,463
Deborah dragging Mary into the sunlight where
Mary burst into flames and died. Deborah returned

282
00:26:40,503 --> 00:26:45,923
to Andrew, who peacefully died in her arms.
Decades later, Andrew's body was resurrected

283
00:26:46,243 --> 00:26:52,126
and now also purged of any innate vampire weaknesses.
Realizing after several suicide attempts that

284
00:26:52,146 --> 00:26:58,550
he was incapable of death even by standard vampire
killing methods, Andrew became apathetic, now

285
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:04,513
tired of living. After being sent to hell alongside
other demonic heroes and villains to partake

286
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:10,116
in a war between the demon Neron and Satanus,
Andrew was later resurrected back on Earth

287
00:27:10,436 --> 00:27:16,493
by the new cult of the blood red moon. now controlled
by Deborah. In post-Flashpoint continuity,

288
00:27:16,873 --> 00:27:21,857
Andrew's past was rewritten so that in the 16th
century he was the young aristocratic son of

289
00:27:21,897 --> 00:27:27,161
a British lord. Mary was now a servant girl
who worked in the Bennett estate, and she and

290
00:27:27,281 --> 00:27:32,746
Andrew fell in love. Andrew's father, however,
disapproved of their relationship as he felt

291
00:27:32,866 --> 00:27:38,390
Mary's social class made her unfit for marriage
to his son. Upon learning this, that same night,

292
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,591
the heartbroken Andrew

293
00:27:42,654 --> 00:27:47,817
His coach was damaged and his coachman was killed
in the accident. Emerging from the wreckage,

294
00:27:48,177 --> 00:27:53,661
Andrew encountered the biblical Cain, who shared
his story of how he was forced to wander the

295
00:27:53,761 --> 00:27:59,806
earth after killing his brother Abel, cursed
by God with vampirism. Cain eventually found

296
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:05,390
a woman, Lilith, Adam's first wife who had been
cast out of Eden prior to Eve's creation.

297
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:17,775
only for her to return to life, now sharing
in Cain's curse. Cain and Lilith became lovers

298
00:28:17,875 --> 00:28:23,680
and had many children who terrorized the planet.
Eventually, Cain and his family were attacked

299
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:29,645
by Etrigan the Demon and other sorcerers in
an attempt to steal his power. Cain survived,

300
00:28:29,945 --> 00:28:35,470
but Lilith and their family did not, and a new
curse was placed upon Cain that if he ever

301
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:41,611
fed on an innocent soul, he would be imprisoned
for eternity. Smelling the love for Mary within

302
00:28:41,751 --> 00:28:48,397
Andrew and confusing it for lust, Kane attacked
him, only to realize upon biting him that Andrew

303
00:28:48,657 --> 00:28:55,082
was indeed innocent. Kane's spirit was sucked
into Andrew's body, which became a prison known

304
00:28:55,223 --> 00:29:01,027
as a demon lock. Cursed with vampirism, Andrew
was afraid to return home in fear of harming

305
00:29:01,128 --> 00:29:07,033
Mary or his family, leaving Mary to feel abandoned,
while forced to submit to the sexual abuse

306
00:29:07,073 --> 00:29:12,767
of Andrew's father. After gaining control over
his bloodlust by feeding on animal blood, Andrew

307
00:29:12,807 --> 00:29:18,850
returned home after a year with the intention
of making Mary his eternal bride. Mary agreed,

308
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:24,732
and after being turned, she admitted her disdain
for him, promising to use her new power to

309
00:29:24,773 --> 00:29:29,775
get revenge on him and all who wronged her,
leaving Andrew to find that she had murdered

310
00:29:29,815 --> 00:29:35,117
his father just before Andrew had returned.
After decades of attempting to stop Mary's

311
00:29:35,177 --> 00:29:41,083
war on humanity, Andrew and Mary came to a truce
that lasted for centuries up until the present

312
00:29:41,123 --> 00:29:47,565
day. After a romantic night together, Mary sent
hundreds of vampires to attack Andrew, forcing

313
00:29:47,605 --> 00:29:53,906
him to kill all of them and be labeled a traitor,
ending their truce. With help from a vampire

314
00:29:53,926 --> 00:30:00,128
hunter named Professor John Truffton, a young
female vampire named Tig Rafelson, John Constantine,

315
00:30:00,528 --> 00:30:04,729
and Batman, the latter two of whom you can learn
more about in their respective dual episodes,

316
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:11,313
Andrew tracked Mary to Gotham City, where Batman
stopped Andrew from killing Mary, only for

317
00:30:11,473 --> 00:30:17,977
Andrew to then be beheaded by Tig, who thought
that by killing Andrew, Mary would also die.

318
00:30:18,377 --> 00:30:24,441
From Andrew's body, the spirit of Cain re-emerged
after centuries, who then summoned all vampires

319
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:29,764
to Gotham City. While the Justice League Dark
protected Gotham citizens, Constantine and

320
00:30:29,824 --> 00:30:34,259
Deadman traveled to the afterlife and found
Andrew. You can learn more about the Justice

321
00:30:34,279 --> 00:30:39,364
League Dark in their team duel episode against
the Midnight Suns. With help from Madame Xanadu,

322
00:30:39,825 --> 00:30:46,552
Andrew returned to the world of the living tethered
to Kane's power, and now his equal. After executing

323
00:30:46,592 --> 00:30:52,739
Kane and absorbing his full power, Andrew gained
full control over all vampires, including Mary,

324
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:57,334
and was able to erase the memory of vampires
from everyone in the city. After helping the

325
00:30:57,374 --> 00:31:02,576
Justice League Dark obtain a map to the Books
of Magic, Andrew resettled all vampires on

326
00:31:02,616 --> 00:31:07,957
a compound in Utah. After an army of vampire
hunters, known as the Order of Van Helsing's,

327
00:31:08,037 --> 00:31:13,379
learned about the compound, they attacked and
killed 60% of the vampires there, while also

328
00:31:13,459 --> 00:31:19,660
unleashing evil magic that turned dead vampires
into uncontrollable zombie vampires.

329
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:29,974
The same way that he contained Cain's spirit,
Andrew absorbed the evil magic and all vampires'

330
00:31:30,034 --> 00:31:35,998
souls, curing the remaining vampires on the
planet of their vampirism, including Mary,

331
00:31:36,298 --> 00:31:41,742
and turning himself evil in the process. After
turning Tig back into a vampire and taking

332
00:31:41,782 --> 00:31:47,906
her as his queen, Andrew attempted to destroy
creation by merging heaven and hell. Tig betrayed

333
00:31:47,946 --> 00:31:53,818
him, however, decapitating Mary and promising
to kill Andrew as well. With Cain emerging

334
00:31:53,858 --> 00:31:59,259
from a portal to hell, he pulled all of the
vampire souls from Andrew in an effort to find

335
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:05,461
his ancient bride Lilith, whose spirit he projected
into Tig. Purged from the evil influence of

336
00:32:05,481 --> 00:32:11,102
the vampire souls, Andrew stopped his own plan
to destroy creation with the help of Mary's

337
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:17,684
spirit, now an agent of God. With help from
the fallen angel Lucifer, Andrew and Mary managed

338
00:32:17,804 --> 00:32:23,514
to defeat Cain and Lilith by trapping them in
the house of mystery and hell. With her mission

339
00:32:23,534 --> 00:32:30,337
complete, Mary gave Andrew a loving goodbye
before departing the mortal plane. Andrew remained,

340
00:32:30,477 --> 00:32:36,239
known to all now, as the Lord of Vampires, charged
with keeping the vampire population in check

341
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:42,242
in order to maintain peace with humanity. Powers-wise,
Andrew Bennett is the planet's most powerful

342
00:32:42,282 --> 00:32:48,684
vampire, imbued with the power of the very first
vampire, Cain. Andrew has enhanced superhuman

343
00:32:48,744 --> 00:32:55,711
senses and physicality. In addition, to regeneration
and mental powers, including telekinesis, clairvoyance,

344
00:32:55,831 --> 00:33:02,374
and hypnosis. Andrew is also able to transform
his body into other forms, including a wolf,

345
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:08,737
a bat, or a half-man hybrid of either of those,
allowing him to grow wings or fangs if needed.

346
00:33:09,177 --> 00:33:15,980
He could also transform into a swarm of bats
or rats, or a mist that grants him intangibility.

347
00:33:16,581 --> 00:33:22,555
In post-Flashpoint vampire lore, Vampires do
not die from sunlight exposure, but are merely

348
00:33:22,635 --> 00:33:29,658
weakened and robbed of any supernatural abilities.
Andrew himself is not vulnerable to many typical

349
00:33:29,698 --> 00:33:35,120
vampire weaknesses, though he can be affected
by holy magic-imbued artifacts or elements.

350
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:41,703
He's also capable of conjuring various weapons,
often bladed, such as swords, daggers, and

351
00:33:41,903 --> 00:33:46,725
even wooden stakes. And that's Andrew Bennett.
I still can't get over why he's called Andrew

352
00:33:46,765 --> 00:33:51,100
Bennett. Why don't they just call him... Dracula
if he's the lord of the vampires. Because there

353
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,604
was a real Dracula, like Vlad Dracul the second
or something like that. I think that was his

354
00:33:56,644 --> 00:34:02,788
name. Yeah. He's not that character. Well, does
Dracula exist in the DC universe? I'm sure

355
00:34:02,828 --> 00:34:07,612
he does. I don't think I've come across him,
but you know, he's not a part of Andrew Bennett's

356
00:34:07,652 --> 00:34:13,936
story. Why does the name Andrew Bennett offend
you? Because it's lame. Apologies to any actual

357
00:34:14,056 --> 00:34:18,010
Andrew Bennets that are out there. Which I'm
sure there are at least several dozen listening

358
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:22,091
to this right now, because it's a common ass
fucking name and certainly does not belong

359
00:34:22,251 --> 00:34:29,953
as the name of a vampire. OK, vampire name expert
over here. Holy shit. That was a pretty good

360
00:34:29,973 --> 00:34:34,255
backstory. Of course, it can't compete with
the one and only Dracula. So let me go ahead

361
00:34:34,275 --> 00:34:41,197
and get into that. Vlad Tepes Dracula was born
in 1430 in Shostberg, Transylvania in what

362
00:34:41,217 --> 00:34:47,643
would later become present day Romania. His
father. Vlad Dracul was a noble lord who was

363
00:34:47,683 --> 00:34:54,406
named Prince of Wallachia by the Holy Roman
Emperor Sigismund II. As a young adult, Vlad

364
00:34:54,466 --> 00:35:00,368
Tepes Dracula was named the new Prince of Wallachia
when his father was murdered by his most trusted

365
00:35:00,408 --> 00:35:05,691
advisors, and he quickly developed a ruthless
reputation when he sentenced all those involved

366
00:35:06,031 --> 00:35:11,653
to death by impalement. Vlad waged a bloodthirsty
campaign in a war against the Ottoman Empire

367
00:35:12,066 --> 00:35:17,670
but was mortally wounded on the battlefield
by En-Sabah Nur, an ancient mutant who later

368
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:22,354
became known as Apocalypse that you can learn
more about in his duel against Black Adam.

369
00:35:22,494 --> 00:35:28,399
Vlad was taken to a Romani healer named Leanda
who was ordered to use her magic to prevent

370
00:35:28,439 --> 00:35:34,284
him from dying. Unbeknownst to Vlad, however,
Leanda was a vampire guided by the ancient

371
00:35:34,304 --> 00:35:40,529
commands of the very first vampire, Varney,
who knew of Vlad's vicious nature. Leanda bit

372
00:35:40,569 --> 00:35:46,644
Vlad. drinking his blood until his human form
perished and he was reborn in darkness, becoming

373
00:35:46,704 --> 00:35:53,006
Varnay's successor as the Lord of Vampires.
From Castle Dracula in Transylvania, Vlad,

374
00:35:53,206 --> 00:35:58,308
now known as Dracula, turned a bevy of women
into his vampire brides and spawned a number

375
00:35:58,348 --> 00:36:03,851
of children, almost all of whom would grow to
hate him. His brutality spread across Europe,

376
00:36:04,251 --> 00:36:09,433
leading to numerous assassination attempts,
all of which failed and grew his evil reputation.

377
00:36:11,114 --> 00:36:17,115
A man named Hans Van Helsing died in his efforts
to kill Dracula, and his wife, Rachel, swore

378
00:36:17,155 --> 00:36:22,437
that the Van Helsing line would not rest until
Dracula was destroyed. Nearly a century later,

379
00:36:22,657 --> 00:36:28,538
the first man to ever successfully kill Dracula
was a Puritan vanquisher of evil named Solomon

380
00:36:28,598 --> 00:36:33,960
Kane, who staked the vampire through the heart
with an ornate cross, turning him into an ancient

381
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,461
skeleton. Shortly after, however, a band of
thieves raided the castle and removed the valuable

382
00:36:41,122 --> 00:36:46,406
which revived him. Dracula later learned of
a dark magic book known as the Darkhold, and

383
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:52,010
a spell within it called the Montesi formula,
which was capable of destroying all vampires.

384
00:36:52,511 --> 00:36:57,835
Though Dracula tried to retrieve the tome from
the Vatican, a sorcerer named Cogliostro managed

385
00:36:57,855 --> 00:37:03,960
to steal it first. In revenge, Dracula turned
the sorcerer's wife, adding her to his collection

386
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:12,218
of brides. In the late 19th century, Dracula
summoned an estate agent to discuss purchasing

387
00:37:12,258 --> 00:37:17,819
land in England, and he became obsessed with
an image of Jonathan Harker's wife, named Mina

388
00:37:17,879 --> 00:37:22,861
Murray. Holding Harker captive with his brides,
Dracula traveled to England where he turned

389
00:37:22,921 --> 00:37:28,202
Mina Murray's friend Lucy and began to seduce
her. Jonathan Harker managed to escape the

390
00:37:28,222 --> 00:37:33,564
castle, however, and with the help of Abraham
Van Helsing, they staked and beheaded Dracula,

391
00:37:33,924 --> 00:37:38,765
seemingly killing him for good. Though Dracula
survived due to Harker's and Van Helsing's

392
00:37:38,805 --> 00:37:44,468
blades, not being made out of silver or wood.
The events involving Mina Marie and Jonathan

393
00:37:44,508 --> 00:37:50,710
Harker were later adapted into a book by novelist
Bram Stoker. As revenge against England for

394
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:56,473
this repulsion, Dracula turned a British noble
named John Falsworth into a vampire and set

395
00:37:56,493 --> 00:38:02,075
him loose in Britain around the time of World
War I, dubbing his latest minion as Baron Blood,

396
00:38:02,435 --> 00:38:06,657
who would go on to become a recurring villain
for many of Marvel's heroes. During World War

397
00:38:06,697 --> 00:38:12,369
II, Dracula returned to his castle to find it
occupied by Nazi soldiers, and he turned the

398
00:38:12,389 --> 00:38:18,013
commander, forcing him to kill his own troops.
In modern times, Dracula fought and killed

399
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:24,037
one of the most prolific vampire hunters of
the late 20th century, a man named Jamal Afari.

400
00:38:24,477 --> 00:38:30,061
Because of this, Afari's pupil, named Blade,
swore vengeance against the Lord of Vampires.

401
00:38:30,621 --> 00:38:35,124
Teaming up with other vampire hunters, Blade
and the group managed to stake Dracula through

402
00:38:35,144 --> 00:38:40,351
the heart, killing him. though Blade was the
only survivor. You can learn more about Blade

403
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:45,653
in his duel against Azrael. A descendant of
Dracula's, a man by the name of Frank Drake,

404
00:38:45,893 --> 00:38:51,315
inherited Castle Dracula, and in his inspection
of the castle, came across Dracula's coffin

405
00:38:51,415 --> 00:38:56,718
containing his staked skeleton. Frank Drake
removed the stake, unknowing what it was, and

406
00:38:56,758 --> 00:39:02,600
in doing so revived Dracula. Ashamed by his
actions, Frank Drake used his wealth to finance

407
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:08,970
other vampire hunters, teaming up with the likes
of Blade. a vampire named Hannibal King, Quincy

408
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:14,492
Harker, who was the son of Mina Murray and Jonathan
Harker, and the descendant of Abraham Van Helsing

409
00:39:14,612 --> 00:39:19,693
named Rachel Van Helsing. Many of these hunters
would go on to form the vampire hunting group

410
00:39:19,793 --> 00:39:25,515
known as the Nightstalkers under the direction
of the hero sorcerer Doctor Strange. Eventually,

411
00:39:25,575 --> 00:39:31,156
Doctor Strange himself would cast the Darkhold
spell of the Montessi formula, eradicating

412
00:39:31,197 --> 00:39:37,696
Dracula and all vampires on Earth. For a long
time, Dracula, it seemed, was finally and fully

413
00:39:37,756 --> 00:39:43,640
dead. But, many years later, an elder demon
of hell named Asmodeus drew upon Dracula's

414
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:50,806
spirit and reconstructed his body in Castle
Dracula using the souls of 666 victims. Dracula

415
00:39:50,826 --> 00:39:55,870
would go on to work alongside the monster hunter
Elsa Bloodstone against a clan of vampire-like

416
00:39:55,950 --> 00:40:01,875
creatures called the Nosferati, who had plotted
to infect Dracula and all vampires with a virus

417
00:40:01,895 --> 00:40:06,690
that would turn them into a blood supply for
the creatures. Not long after, one of Dracula's

418
00:40:06,731 --> 00:40:13,875
sons, named Xeris, staged a coup to usurp the
Lord of Vampires title by uniting the Nosferati,

419
00:40:14,215 --> 00:40:19,838
the Atlantean, and the Charneyputra vampire
sects against his father. Xeris staked Dracula,

420
00:40:19,999 --> 00:40:24,601
decapitating him, and had the various sects
distribute his remains so as not to be joined

421
00:40:24,641 --> 00:40:30,525
again. Under Xeris' rule, the vampires waged
war on humans and mutants alike, going to battle

422
00:40:30,545 --> 00:40:36,107
with the X-Men. Although Xerath managed to bite
and turn the former mutant hero Jubilee, the

423
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:42,749
X-Men managed to resurrect Dracula, who in turn
ripped his son Xerath's head off. To save Jubilee

424
00:40:42,789 --> 00:40:47,711
from Dracula's hold over her, Wolverine traveled
to Castle Dracula, where he teamed up with

425
00:40:47,731 --> 00:40:53,253
the supernatural fighting force called the Howling
Commandos. Although Wolverine managed to decapitate

426
00:40:53,273 --> 00:40:57,927
Dracula and have his head launched into the
sun, he Dracula's head eventually grew back

427
00:40:58,067 --> 00:41:03,310
since the killing was not ceremoniously performed
with wood or silver. Determining he would start

428
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:08,734
his vampire nation anew, Dracula ordered the
genocide of his own kind in order to weed out

429
00:41:08,774 --> 00:41:14,158
the weak. Then in revenge against Wolverine,
Dracula lured him to Paris where his vampire

430
00:41:14,218 --> 00:41:19,642
soldiers stole a sample of his blood which was
then transferred into Dracula where the healing

431
00:41:19,682 --> 00:41:26,426
effects made him now able to survive in sunlight.
And that's Dracula's backstory. Dracula is

432
00:41:26,466 --> 00:41:32,328
the most powerful vampire in existence as the
Lord of Vampires. He has a wide array of abilities

433
00:41:32,408 --> 00:41:37,371
ranging from the physical, to the psychic, to
the mystical. First off, he has razor sharp

434
00:41:37,391 --> 00:41:42,133
fangs that can transfer the curse of vampirism
to his victims upon biting them. He also has

435
00:41:42,193 --> 00:41:48,055
razor sharp claws, as well as enhanced strength,
able to lift around 4 tons, enhanced speed,

436
00:41:48,536 --> 00:41:54,851
agility, and senses including a mystical sense.
He is immortal. unaging with a regenerative

437
00:41:54,891 --> 00:42:00,194
healing factor, capable of repairing all but
a very specifically administered set of wounds,

438
00:42:00,695 --> 00:42:05,458
and he can even resurrect under proper conditions,
such as placing his ashes in a coffin filled

439
00:42:05,478 --> 00:42:10,682
with soil from his homeland, being touched by
the tears of a virgin, or by removing the stake

440
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:15,625
if he is staked through the heart. Dracula has
psionic abilities able to mentally control

441
00:42:15,685 --> 00:42:21,209
not just other vampires, but other people via
hypnosis through eye contact. He can mentally

442
00:42:21,249 --> 00:42:26,651
control the weather. on par with heroes such
as Storm or Thor, and he can summon or shapeshift

443
00:42:26,671 --> 00:42:33,213
his form into a mist, a collective of bats,
a pack of rats, a clutter of spiders, a pack

444
00:42:33,253 --> 00:42:39,894
of wolves, or turn into a larger humanoid, wolf,
or bat-like form. Dracula is a powerful dark

445
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:45,656
magician and able to cast spells such as summoning
golems or undead vampires or zombies around

446
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:50,677
him. He's an adept strategist with centuries
of experience and knowledge, and is an expert

447
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:57,563
and he often carries a sword with him, a long
blade with serrated edges. Weakness-wise, Dracula

448
00:42:57,683 --> 00:43:03,805
has a lot. He is repelled by crosses and other
religious icons and locations, such as churches.

449
00:43:04,305 --> 00:43:09,687
Holy water burns him. He is especially vulnerable
to silver and wood weapons, such as stakes,

450
00:43:09,907 --> 00:43:15,068
spears, or bullets. He dies if he's staked through
the heart, though he comes back if the stake

451
00:43:15,108 --> 00:43:20,202
is removed. Garlic and wolf's pain are also
effective at repelling him. He does have to

452
00:43:20,242 --> 00:43:25,226
make contact with his native Transylvanian soil
once a day, and he has to consume blood to

453
00:43:25,266 --> 00:43:29,950
maintain his strength or he'll become weak with
thirst. He used to be weak to sunlight as I

454
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:35,174
mentioned, but since acquiring Wolverine's healing
factor that is no longer an issue. And that's

455
00:43:35,214 --> 00:43:40,539
Dracula. So essentially these characters are
pretty much the same, except Dracula has more

456
00:43:40,579 --> 00:43:44,382
weaknesses. Except Dracula has a better name.
But yeah, I mean if I had to put my money on

457
00:43:44,402 --> 00:43:50,551
who's a more badass vampire between Cain and
Dracula, I'd- put my money on Kane and Andrew

458
00:43:50,591 --> 00:43:54,894
bad the site isn't with Kane so who gives a
shit but like Andrew Bennett is essentially

459
00:43:54,954 --> 00:44:01,278
Kane's successor you know who cares Dracula's
Varney successor big deal yeah but like Dracula

460
00:44:01,298 --> 00:44:06,502
was turned into a vampire by some peasant woman
whereas Andrew Bennett was transformed by the

461
00:44:06,662 --> 00:44:13,726
vampire of all vampires yeah after the flashpoint
and we all know that retcon was retconned because

462
00:44:13,766 --> 00:44:21,673
DC don't do continuity well for all we know
the Pre-flashpoint was also Kane. So you don't

463
00:44:21,713 --> 00:44:23,258
know. You don't know either.

464
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:34,751
And now that we got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

465
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:40,535
of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not the speculation,

466
00:44:40,855 --> 00:44:45,117
but it's fun to imagine how the fight could
play out. Alfred Jarvis 9000, what are the

467
00:44:45,157 --> 00:44:50,220
rules of our speculation? Well, I should say
there are no rules, other than the characters

468
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,783
have no prior knowledge of the other going into
the fight. All they are aware of starting out

469
00:44:55,103 --> 00:44:59,385
is that the other character is a threat that
needs to be eliminated. For the speculation...

470
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:04,874
contestants will begin approximately 50 meters
apart in a nondescript environment that will

471
00:45:04,914 --> 00:45:10,239
have no bearing on the match itself as no environmental
statistics are considered in my simulations

472
00:45:10,539 --> 00:45:15,744
the contestants must earn victory on their own
merit. Alright then let's get into it. Andrew

473
00:45:15,804 --> 00:45:20,769
Bennett and Dracula meet on the battlefield
who goes first? I'm just gonna say it ain't

474
00:45:20,809 --> 00:45:27,956
no way Dracula is gonna let some lame-ass named
Andrew Bennett go first. I hope someone actually

475
00:45:28,036 --> 00:45:32,171
named Andrew Bennett like finds you on the street
and just beats your ass

476
00:45:35,978 --> 00:45:42,023
I mean, it's a good name. It's just not it's
not good for a vampire. Uh, so Dracula goes

477
00:45:42,063 --> 00:45:47,388
first, the Lord of the vampires. Uh, he's going
to start off by, he's going to raise his sword

478
00:45:47,628 --> 00:45:53,833
up and he's going to summon a cloak of dark
clouds that just cover the entire sky with

479
00:45:53,873 --> 00:45:58,257
some flashes of lightning, but like everything's
dark. And then Dracula is going to transform

480
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:03,381
just bursting into this flock of bats that just
disappear into the darkness surrounding them.

481
00:46:03,882 --> 00:46:08,023
Okay, well, I mean, Andrew definitely knows
now that he's up against a vampire, clearly.

482
00:46:08,563 --> 00:46:14,986
So he does kind of conjure up a pair of wooden
stakes in his hands. And, you know, he's just

483
00:46:15,006 --> 00:46:20,208
going to peer into that darkness and grow a
pair of giant bat wings. And he's just going

484
00:46:20,228 --> 00:46:27,391
to take to the air to stake those bats. OK,
so the bats are swirling around, flying through

485
00:46:27,411 --> 00:46:32,553
the air. And old Andy's trying to stake him.
But all of a sudden, in this like shadowy blur,

486
00:46:33,014 --> 00:46:38,537
Dracula is gonna emerge from the flock of bats
midair and he's gonna use a sword to just slice

487
00:46:39,058 --> 00:46:44,061
Those wooden stakes in half and then just as
quickly and then just as quickly Dracula is

488
00:46:44,081 --> 00:46:50,246
gonna become a flock of bats again Flying into
the clouds above mr. Bennett, and he's gonna

489
00:46:50,286 --> 00:46:55,269
send down a lightning bolt that knocks him out
of the sky That's Lord Bennett to you punk

490
00:46:55,449 --> 00:47:01,806
ass Before the lightning strikes, I'm gonna
say that Andrew transforms into a mist that

491
00:47:01,826 --> 00:47:07,228
makes him intangible to that lightning bolt.
After which, he's just going to flow up into

492
00:47:07,248 --> 00:47:12,690
the dark clouds and he's just going to let those
bats fly right into his mist form, at which

493
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:19,733
point Andrew's going to transform into a pack
of rats that attack the bats midair and cause

494
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:25,716
them to crash down to the ground. So it's just
raining bats and rats like a horrible plague

495
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:32,402
or something. Well, as each bat hits the ground,
it's going to. burst into this like small cloud

496
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:39,425
of black mist. And the mist is gonna all gather
together and reform into the form of Dracula.

497
00:47:39,986 --> 00:47:44,367
At which point Dracula is gonna like raise his
hand and summon a horde of zombies all around

498
00:47:44,407 --> 00:47:48,689
him across the environment. And those zombies
are just gonna beat the shit out of these rats.

499
00:47:48,729 --> 00:47:55,772
Damn. Ha ha ha. Geez. Except that like the rats,
they're gonna group together and reform into

500
00:47:55,952 --> 00:48:01,987
Andrew. Now in this terrifying like werewolf
form, right? And he straight up just rips right

501
00:48:02,027 --> 00:48:08,973
through these slow ass zombies slashing a path
right to Dracula whose head he just tears right

502
00:48:09,013 --> 00:48:14,137
the hell off. You mean he tries to tear off
Dracula's head, but Dracula is just gonna stand

503
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:21,283
there staring at him, smiling with his eyes
glowing red, and uh, Andre Benson, he's gonna

504
00:48:21,323 --> 00:48:27,247
be frozen in place under Dracula's hypnotic
control. I mean that's not gonna work on a

505
00:48:27,287 --> 00:48:34,592
vampire as powerful as Andrew Bennett. So that
smile turns upside down real quick. But why

506
00:48:34,632 --> 00:48:42,036
won't this work? Dude, would you say that Andrew
Bennett could hypnotize Dracula? Fuck no. Exactly.

507
00:48:42,997 --> 00:48:49,760
You say that, but like Dracula was able to exert
some influence against even the queen of monsters

508
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:56,004
in the Marvel comics. So like Dracula may not
be able to control Anders mind, but he at least

509
00:48:56,064 --> 00:49:01,026
forces him to revert into his humanoid form.
You know. mid slash as he tries to take off

510
00:49:01,046 --> 00:49:08,711
his head. So instead of decapitating Dracula,
Mr. Beckett just slaps him. And that was a

511
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:14,614
mistake. Cause Dracula is gonna grab him by
the wrist and twist it, causing Anton to flip

512
00:49:14,674 --> 00:49:19,476
onto his back on the ground where Dracula just
stakes him through the heart with his sword.

513
00:49:19,897 --> 00:49:25,800
Boom, telekinetic shield. That sword just bounces
right off of it. And Andrew Bennett, he's gonna

514
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:30,499
follow up with a telekinetic blast from the
ground. That's just gonna send Dracula on his

515
00:49:30,659 --> 00:49:36,623
ass. Uh, at which point, Andrew gets on his
feet, and in like this wicked fast flurry,

516
00:49:37,103 --> 00:49:42,267
he's going to pin Dracula's hands and feet to
the ground with silver daggers, like crucifixion

517
00:49:42,307 --> 00:49:48,051
style. And while Dracula is like writhing in
pain, Andrew's just gonna look down on him

518
00:49:48,411 --> 00:49:53,274
with like another silver dagger in his hand,
and he's gonna be like, my name is Andrew Bennett,

519
00:49:53,695 --> 00:50:00,299
bitch, before stinking him right through the
heart and killing him. Okay, uh, yeah, Dracula

520
00:50:00,419 --> 00:50:05,382
is in pain from the silver daggers in his hands
and feet, but right as, uh, Drew Barrymore

521
00:50:05,522 --> 00:50:10,726
tries to stake him in the heart, the silver
dagger just goes through a cluster of spiders,

522
00:50:11,186 --> 00:50:17,170
because Dracula turns into spiders and these
spiders crawl up and around Mr. Bentley's arm

523
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:25,056
and into his mouth when suddenly a sword erupts
from out of his chest, slicing up and around

524
00:50:25,276 --> 00:50:32,288
as Dracula emerges from inside. Ashton's now
sliced in half body. Andrew Bennett, it's Andrew

525
00:50:32,308 --> 00:50:37,990
Bennett. It's not worth remembering, he's dead.
Jeez. Dude, I'm pretty sure Dracula wouldn't

526
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:43,253
be able to use his powers if he was positioned
in the shape of a cruciform with silver in

527
00:50:43,293 --> 00:50:49,336
his body. Well, what do you know? You don't
know. Dude, I know what you told me. Yeah,

528
00:50:49,356 --> 00:50:54,678
but it's like, you know, it's fiction. So...
Oh my gosh. Let's go ahead and leave the match

529
00:50:54,718 --> 00:51:00,101
there. Either Andrew Bennett stakes Dracula
to the ground in the shape of a cross and then

530
00:51:00,141 --> 00:51:06,484
stakes his heart, or Dracula turns into spiders,
goes into Andrew Bennett's body, and stakes

531
00:51:06,524 --> 00:51:10,847
him through the heart from the inside while
cutting his body in half. Pretty violent, but

532
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:16,090
they're vampires, so it makes sense. All right,
let's enter the stats and find out who's gonna

533
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:24,398
come out on top. AG9K, hit it. Inputting data,
running calculations, processing results. Simulations

534
00:51:24,438 --> 00:51:30,581
complete. All right, that was pretty fun. Despite
having a horrible name, I will say that Andrew

535
00:51:30,601 --> 00:51:36,124
Bennett came out almost identical to Dracula.
Yeah, their stats are fairly close, you know,

536
00:51:36,424 --> 00:51:42,967
in terms of movement speed, evasiveness, strength,
even fighting skill and range, they're pretty

537
00:51:43,027 --> 00:51:49,535
much equal. We did say that Dracula was less
durable. than Andrew Bennett because Dracula

538
00:51:49,715 --> 00:51:55,139
has more weaknesses. Although he did overcome
his weakness to sunlight, he's still affected

539
00:51:55,179 --> 00:52:00,844
by a lot more things than Andrew Bennett's character.
Plus, Andrew Bennett is able to produce some

540
00:52:00,884 --> 00:52:05,647
of those weaknesses, just conjure them in his
hands. So Dracula lost a point in durability

541
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:12,292
for that reason as well. When it came to intelligence,
we did say that Dracula was smarter, not only

542
00:52:12,332 --> 00:52:19,103
because he lived longer, but also he has more
experience as a leader of vampires than Andrew.

543
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:26,225
Perception wise though, we gave Andrew the edge
because he is clairvoyant. Versatility wise,

544
00:52:26,525 --> 00:52:32,287
both of these guys are highly versatile as the
Lord of the vampires of the respective universes.

545
00:52:32,587 --> 00:52:37,048
They do a bunch of stuff. Yeah, I totally thought
Dracula would have Andrew Bennett in the versatility

546
00:52:37,088 --> 00:52:42,169
department considering all the different powers
that he has, but unfortunately Andrew Bennett

547
00:52:42,189 --> 00:52:46,475
can do just as much, pretty much. The real difference
we found there was that Dracula is able to

548
00:52:46,515 --> 00:52:51,777
control the weather, whereas Andrew Bennett
has telekinetic abilities. And can summon weapons.

549
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:58,200
Yeah. So taking all of these stats into consideration,
Joseph, who do you think came out on top? Not

550
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:04,943
some loser like Andrew Bennett. I would hate
to give the win to Andrew Bennett. You know,

551
00:53:04,983 --> 00:53:11,998
fucking Dracula. It's a vampire match, of course
Dracula. And our Instagram poll takers. agree

552
00:53:12,018 --> 00:53:16,781
with me. Of course they do. Largely probably
because they don't have no fucking clue who

553
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:22,984
Andrew Bennett is. 80% of them think that Dracula
is going to take this. Yeah, but I mean, by

554
00:53:23,024 --> 00:53:26,846
the time we figured out what duel we were doing
for this episode because we weren't sure it

555
00:53:26,866 --> 00:53:31,889
was kind of a last minute decision, this poll
has not been up for 24 hours yet. So there's

556
00:53:31,929 --> 00:53:37,052
still time for people to vote for Andrew Bennett.
Like you never know. Andrew Bennett could take

557
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:43,444
the win in this poll. He's not gonna. He's just
some random dude. He's cool, I swear. You guys

558
00:53:43,484 --> 00:53:49,908
heard it. You know he's cool now. But let's
find out who won. AJ9K, the results please.

559
00:53:50,529 --> 00:53:58,394
Hey Yuasa. All right, the winner of the dual
matchup between Andrew Bennett and Dracula

560
00:53:58,994 --> 00:54:10,226
is Dracula. Of course it is, but barely. By
53.2% or 532 of the 1000 matches. Andrew Bennett

561
00:54:10,286 --> 00:54:16,309
won 468. Of course he would lose. He's literally
nobody. One of these days I hope they make

562
00:54:16,629 --> 00:54:21,831
a comic book character named Joseph Garcia.
So I can talk about what a fucking loser that

563
00:54:21,871 --> 00:54:27,634
character is and how lame they are just because
their name is Joseph Garcia. All comic book

564
00:54:27,654 --> 00:54:32,657
characters have to have a name. Why is Andrew
Bennett like apparently the worst one? Is it

565
00:54:32,697 --> 00:54:38,512
any worse than Steve Rogers? No, but Steve Rogers
is also Captain America. Andrew Bennett is

566
00:54:38,592 --> 00:54:43,817
a tax accountant that works down the street
at the H&R block in the local shopping center.

567
00:54:44,137 --> 00:54:47,920
Not the freaking Lord of vampires like Dracula.
Let me tell you that there's going to be an

568
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:52,504
Andrew Bennett who actually works at an H&R
block listening to this episode. He was like,

569
00:54:52,704 --> 00:54:53,525
oh, I feel seen.

570
00:54:56,768 --> 00:55:02,873
We do see you, Andrew. We see you. Yeah, you're
a badass. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

571
00:55:02,893 --> 00:55:08,073
Badass name. fucking vampire, lord of the vampires.

583
00:56:12,997 --> 00:56:17,740
We've already talked about the first Blade and
Blade 2, so this will round out the trilogy

584
00:56:18,101 --> 00:56:23,725
by talking about this shit show of a film. Oh
my god, it's so bad. Yeah, Dracula's in the

585
00:56:23,765 --> 00:56:30,126
movie and he sucks. So at the end of the day,
Marvel's Dracula really is. a big fucking loser.

586
00:56:30,666 --> 00:56:34,788
That does it for this episode, we want to give
a big thanks to our executive producers Ken
