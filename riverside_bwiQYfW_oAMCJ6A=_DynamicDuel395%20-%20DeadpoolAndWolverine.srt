00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,957
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,174 --> 00:00:28,116
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:33,320
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based

4
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:39,544
battle simulations. I'm Marvelist Joe. And I'm
his twin brother Johnny DC. And this is the

5
00:00:39,584 --> 00:00:44,727
episode where we review the latest Marvel Studios
cinematic release, Deadpool and Wolverine.

6
00:00:45,228 --> 00:00:49,170
Was it awesome? I'm not going to say right now.
I'll let you know my thoughts later on this

7
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:55,114
episode. Yeah, it was awesome. It was awesome.
Of course it was. It was pretty damn awesome.

8
00:00:55,414 --> 00:01:00,616
But yeah, I can't wait to talk about it. Before
we get into that, there was a shit ton of San

9
00:01:00,636 --> 00:01:05,739
Diego Comic-Con news to come out this past week
for Marvel and DC. Not all of it great news.

10
00:01:06,059 --> 00:01:11,141
In fact, most of it was really disappointing
news. So I'm like really glad that Deadpool

11
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:15,463
and Wolverine was a good movie. Otherwise I'd
be pretty damn depressed right now. But we're

12
00:01:15,483 --> 00:01:20,125
gonna be talking about how the Russo brothers
are attached to direct Avengers Doomsday and

13
00:01:20,145 --> 00:01:27,008
Avengers Secret Wars. We learned that Robert
Downey Jr. has been cast as Dr. Doom. I'm still

14
00:01:27,028 --> 00:01:32,471
not over it. Joker Folly I do got an official
trailer. DC Studios unveiled their new logo.

15
00:01:32,952 --> 00:01:38,475
Fantastic Four announced their subtitle for
the film, First Steps. We got the Penguin official

16
00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:43,958
trailer and we got an official teaser for Creature
Commando. So a lot to get through. As always,

17
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:47,860
we list our segment times in our episode description.

out of the way, quick to the no prize. A no

39
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:47,112
prize is an award Marvel used to give out to
fans. Our version, the Dynamic duel No Prize,

40
00:03:47,372 --> 00:03:52,495
is a digital award that we post on Instagram
for the person that we feel gave the best answer

41
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:56,938
to our question of the week. Two weeks ago,
we asked you guys what has been your favorite

42
00:03:56,998 --> 00:04:02,421
Disney Plus original series from Marvel Studios
so far. And we got a lot of answers, let's

43
00:04:02,461 --> 00:04:06,964
go ahead and run down our honorable mentions
as well as the no prize winner. Our first honorable

44
00:04:07,004 --> 00:04:15,104
mention goes to Daniel Alonso, who said... Alright,
so best show on Disney+. Man, I don't know

45
00:04:15,144 --> 00:04:20,568
how you guys don't like Moon Knight. That show
is amazing. I didn't grow up with the comics

46
00:04:20,648 --> 00:04:25,712
or anything, so that was my first introduction.
And you can't beat that suit. I actually really

47
00:04:25,752 --> 00:04:31,996
love that story. The fighting was amazing. Man,
that's the best show on Disney+. That's a Disney

48
00:04:32,016 --> 00:04:38,620
original. Hands down, Moon Knight, dude. So
good. Now imagine if they had actually adapted

49
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:42,502
the story from the comics. how much better it
would have been then. Yeah, I mean, if you

50
00:04:42,522 --> 00:04:46,544
guys are familiar with the Moon Knight character
from the comics, I definitely recommend going

51
00:04:46,704 --> 00:04:52,207
all the way back to what was episode two in
our Batman versus Moon Knight duel episode.

52
00:04:53,227 --> 00:04:58,789
The show was not bad. Like acting-wise, special
effects-wise, action-wise, it was pretty cool.

53
00:04:58,849 --> 00:05:03,871
I just thought it was pretty inconsistent with
the rest of the MCU. And inconsistent with

54
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:09,050
the source material. I didn't dislike it. Even
though a lot of the story was original. to

55
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:14,374
the series, they weren't bad elements, you know?
It was still fairly interesting. Not as interesting

56
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:19,379
as the comic books, but interesting enough to
kind of develop a following for the show. Great

57
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:26,025
answer, Daniel. Our next honorable mention goes
to Cat Stevenson, who said, Hi guys, it's Cat

58
00:05:26,065 --> 00:05:31,590
again, and I really want to say that the best
Disney Plus show is Hawkeye. I know a lot of

59
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:36,386
people are gonna say like Loki, Falcon and the
Winter Soldier, but Hawkeye was so good. with

60
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:41,609
multiple really good character introductions
slash reintroductions with Kingpin, Echo, Kate

61
00:05:41,629 --> 00:05:47,834
Bishop, really, really well done. I loved the
Christmas undertones. Everything about this

62
00:05:47,874 --> 00:05:54,098
show was amazing. I loved the action. I loved
the acting. Everything was really good. Yeah,

63
00:05:54,138 --> 00:05:58,101
Hawkeye was pretty good. I really liked the
Christmas setting. I think it really made the

64
00:05:58,121 --> 00:06:03,325
show stand apart and introduced a lot of fun
elements with Hawkeye, such as the whole I'll

65
00:06:03,345 --> 00:06:07,706
be home for Christmas theme. workshopping his
own trick arrows in the vein of like Home Alone

66
00:06:07,746 --> 00:06:12,068
or something like that. Yeah, Hawkeye was a
lot of fun. And definitely deserved for a character

67
00:06:12,108 --> 00:06:17,089
that never received his own film. A lot of the
story revolved around Kate Bishop, but I thought

68
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:22,991
it was a great passing of the torch or bow as
it were. Yeah. So great answer, Kat. Our next

69
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:28,532
honorable mention goes to Travis Herndon, who
said, What's up dudes? Travis here. Shout out

70
00:06:28,552 --> 00:06:34,566
to my other twins. So my answer had to be Werewolf
by Night. I was very surprised when they announced

71
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:40,988
that, to finally see Werewolf by Night, Madding,
and Elsa Bloodstone within the MCU was just

72
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:46,290
sick. It was awesome. This just opens the door
to the supernatural part of the MCU, which

73
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:53,212
was more my favorite sort of element within
Marvel. So yeah, Werewolf by Night was my favorite.

74
00:06:53,592 --> 00:06:59,093
Great. Yeah, I loved Werewolf by Night as a
Halloween time special presentation by Marvel.

75
00:06:59,273 --> 00:07:04,867
It's to this date. probably the most unique
thing that Marvel Studios has done with its

76
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:10,510
short runtime, its black and white cinematography,
the clear homages to past horror films. I thought

77
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:15,612
it was just incredibly fascinating. Yeah, there's
been a number of projects that Marvel has done

78
00:07:15,712 --> 00:07:21,615
post-Endgame, like War Wolf by Night, like Eternals,
like Moon Knight, that they really haven't

79
00:07:21,995 --> 00:07:26,677
picked up on. But I think of all of those things,
I would love to see them run with War Wolf

80
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:31,827
by Night and the world that sets up. Yeah, like
the dark underworld of monsters and demons

81
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:35,829
and stuff like that. Yeah, yeah. And monster
hunting. It was awesome. Want to give a quick

82
00:07:35,849 --> 00:07:42,433
shout out to Abner O'Terry, who gave the answer
of what if, and the kingpin. Someone did a

83
00:07:42,593 --> 00:07:47,736
really solid impression of Vincent D'Onafrio's
kingpin who gave the answer of Echo. But the

84
00:07:47,836 --> 00:07:55,180
winner of this week's no prize is Scott Camacho,
who said, Odo Loki is my favorite. I'm going

85
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:02,296
to have to give it to WandaVision. only because
they did a great job of the different universes

86
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:09,020
within episodes and then finally ending it with
the good movie to follow. So I think out of

87
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,882
all of them, that's pretty much the one that
nails it for me. So I'm gonna go with Wandavision.

88
00:08:14,383 --> 00:08:19,946
Yeah, Wandavision was the first Marvel Studios
Disney Plus original series to come out. And

89
00:08:20,226 --> 00:08:25,189
in some ways, to me, it still feels like one
of the most special because not only did it

90
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:30,624
have the unique element of riffing on classic
television series throughout the decades, but

91
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:35,387
towards the end, it also felt really cinematic
in that you're like watching a movie on the

92
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:40,330
small screen. And yeah, it was hugely influential
on the greater MCU, you know, spawning movies

93
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:45,814
like Multiverse of Madness and the upcoming
Agatha all along. It was just really well made.

94
00:08:46,114 --> 00:08:51,017
And that's likely why Matt Shackman was hired
to direct the Fantastic Four first steps movie

95
00:08:51,137 --> 00:08:55,166
coming up. Yeah, I don't think I was the biggest
fan of WandaVision when we reviewed it, but

96
00:08:55,206 --> 00:09:00,768
I do have to admire it for its artistry. Like
my favorite Disney Plus series is Loki, and

97
00:09:00,788 --> 00:09:05,009
I'm kind of surprised no one gave that as their
like definitive answer. But WandaVision, I

98
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:10,571
would say is more unique and very ambitious.
Absolutely. So great answer, Scotty. You win

99
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:14,652
this week's No Prize. If you the listener want
a shot at winning your own No Prize, stay tuned

100
00:09:14,672 --> 00:09:18,813
to later on this episode when we'll be asking
another question of the week. And now that

101
00:09:18,853 --> 00:09:20,813
that's done, on to the news!

102
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:31,326
Alright, this past week we had the San Diego
Comic Con event in which we get a ton of news

103
00:09:31,366 --> 00:09:36,470
from Marvel and DC regarding their upcoming
film, comic book, and television movie Slates.

104
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:41,274
There wasn't a whole lot of news, I feel like,
this year that came out of San Diego Comic

105
00:09:41,294 --> 00:09:46,118
Con, and the news that did come out kind of
pissed me off. I'm not gonna lie. But let's

106
00:09:46,138 --> 00:09:50,161
go ahead and get started going through the rundown
of everything that happened. I think one of

107
00:09:50,181 --> 00:09:57,115
the biggest major news items we received was
that the fifth Avengers movie, has been renamed

108
00:09:57,195 --> 00:10:03,139
to Avengers Doomsday. When I saw that, I actually
got really excited because I think a lot of

109
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:09,124
us were expecting that Kang was gonna get replaced
due to the offscreen drama regarding the actor

110
00:10:09,184 --> 00:10:14,268
Jonathan Majors who plays the character of Kang.
Now, you know, if it were me, I wish they would

111
00:10:14,288 --> 00:10:18,232
have just recast Kang. I don't think anybody
would have minded that. But it seems like they're

112
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:25,357
going in a completely different direction by
going with Dr. Doom instead of Kang the Conqueror.

113
00:10:25,906 --> 00:10:31,268
And that normally would really thrill me until
I heard about the casting. But before I talk

114
00:10:31,288 --> 00:10:36,051
about that, we got release dates for the next
two Avengers movies. So Avengers Doomsday is

115
00:10:36,071 --> 00:10:42,254
going to come out in two years, May 2026, which
seems really damn soon. It's likely going to

116
00:10:42,314 --> 00:10:47,596
be filmed back to back with Avengers Secret
Wars, which comes out May 2027, just due to

117
00:10:47,636 --> 00:10:51,863
the proximity of those two release dates. Yeah,
and of course, that's what the Russos did with

118
00:10:51,923 --> 00:10:56,205
Infinity War and Endgame. Those two films came
out almost a year apart, and I believe they

119
00:10:56,225 --> 00:11:00,707
were filmed simultaneously. Yeah, we haven't
had an Avengers film for about six years now,

120
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:04,389
and we won't have another one for two years.
You know, the Avengers are the crown jewel

121
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:10,713
of the MCU, those movies. So it'll be nice to
see them come back and get those epic team

122
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:14,895
stories where we have a lot of characters involved.
They're always a lot of fun. So I'm really

123
00:11:14,935 --> 00:11:18,957
excited for these upcoming two movies, even
though I have no idea now what Doomsday is

124
00:11:18,997 --> 00:11:25,573
going to be about. But let's talk about Doctor
Doom. Doctor Doom, as I think most people know,

125
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:31,996
especially Marvel fans, is probably Marvel's
biggest villain. And I'm talking about bigger

126
00:11:32,016 --> 00:11:37,819
than Thanos in terms of popularity and threat
level to Earth's heroes on a consistent basis.

127
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:43,983
Thanos is very threatening, but he's a cosmic
villain that makes fewer appearances than Doctor

128
00:11:44,023 --> 00:11:49,694
Doom. Doctor Doom is huge. He's primarily a
Fantastic Four villain, posed a threat to almost

129
00:11:49,794 --> 00:11:54,776
every single Marvel hero throughout his span
in the Marvel comics. He was the inspiration

130
00:11:54,796 --> 00:11:59,358
for Darth Vader. Right. Was he? Yeah. I heard
that was a rumor. I don't know if that's actually

131
00:11:59,418 --> 00:12:02,920
true. I believe it. But it wouldn't surprise
me. Yeah. Yeah, I believe it. For sure. The

132
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,622
mask that he wears, very intimidating. You know,
he has his own country. He's the monarch of

133
00:12:07,682 --> 00:12:13,084
Latveria. He's a master of occult magic, similar
to Doctor Strange, but he's also a technological

134
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:18,107
genius much like Reed Richards or Tony Stark.
So he's very formidable. A lot of people have

135
00:12:18,127 --> 00:12:23,332
been looking forward to an accurate depiction
of the comic book character ever since, you

136
00:12:23,352 --> 00:12:28,538
know, before the 2005 Fantastic Four movie because
the Doom we got in that one sucked. You know,

137
00:12:28,578 --> 00:12:33,963
they gave him bioelectricity powers. The Dr.
Doom that was in the 2015 Phantaforstick movie

138
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:38,787
also sucked. You know, he was like some kind
of weird telekinetic mutant birthed out of

139
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:43,571
the negative zone. They never got him right.
And so with the advent of the Fantastic Four

140
00:12:43,591 --> 00:12:47,815
movie coming out, a lot of people were really
anticipating who they were going to cast as

141
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:53,279
Dr. Doom, whether he show up in Fantastic Four
or in Secret Wars or whatever. And what's really

142
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:58,784
sad is that all of these Dr. Doom fans are still
going to have to wait for an accurate depiction

143
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:04,408
of the comic book character because fucking
Robert Downey Jr. is gonna play Victor Von

144
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:12,878
Doom? I don't know. What? What is happening?
Such a dumbass idea. So basically you have

145
00:13:13,098 --> 00:13:18,980
one of the most beloved and most popular actors
to portray a Marvel Studios character coming

146
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,161
back, but not as that character, as a completely
different, perhaps, variant of Doctor Doom,

147
00:13:24,301 --> 00:13:28,502
or perhaps, you know, they're taking a cue from
one of the comic book storylines where Doctor

148
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:32,843
Doom became Iron Man. And note that I said Doctor
Doom became Iron Man in the comics. It was

149
00:13:32,883 --> 00:13:36,964
never really the other way around outside of
like a couple issues where an alternate universe,

150
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:42,466
Tony Stark, became Doctor Doom. And maybe that's
what they're doing here. I think the only way

151
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:48,530
this could possibly work is if Robert Downey
Jr. is Victor Von Doom in the alternate universe

152
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,432
that the Fantastic Four come from. Because we
know that the Fantastic Four movie is taking

153
00:13:52,472 --> 00:13:56,034
place in an alternate universe. And that's why
we're getting like a female silver surfer and

154
00:13:56,054 --> 00:14:00,297
everything like that. That's the only way I
see this working. But there's no way in hell

155
00:14:00,837 --> 00:14:07,301
I will accept Robert Downey Jr. being Victor
Von Doom in the primary 616 cinematic universe.

156
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:13,051
It just doesn't work. No, it boggles the mind,
honestly. I remember when we were talking about

157
00:14:13,251 --> 00:14:17,393
Silver Surfer and how she was going to be a
female, and it was like, OK, does Norenrad

158
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:23,115
not exist in the 616? And in the same way, does
that mean Victor Von Doom does not exist in

159
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:28,757
the 616? It's just weird to me. I feel like
what they're trying to do is make it weird

160
00:14:29,038 --> 00:14:34,120
for the 616 heroes when they see Victor Von
Doom and they're like, oh, what, Tony? Oh,

161
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:41,887
I'm so conflicted. But it's stupid, I feel like.
I just think he's really miscast. When I think

162
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:47,489
of Doctor Doom, I think of someone very sinister
and very cunning. And not that RDJ can't play

163
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:53,212
that, but he's known for playing these fast
talking, wisecracking characters. And I really

164
00:14:53,252 --> 00:14:58,714
don't want to see that in Doctor Doom. No, absolutely
not. No, he's not Doctor Doom. Maybe they'll

165
00:14:58,754 --> 00:15:02,636
alter his voice. You know, maybe they'll cover
up his face. I mean, they should cover up his

166
00:15:02,676 --> 00:15:06,917
face. You never really see Doom's face. And
if you do, it's allegedly scarred to hell.

167
00:15:07,222 --> 00:15:11,024
from when he burned his face when he put the
mask on for the first time, as the legend goes.

168
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:16,108
But even if we don't see his face, I still don't
want Robert Downey Jr. to play Dr. Doom. I

169
00:15:16,128 --> 00:15:20,511
mean, that's even more of a reason to not cast
him, because you could literally cast anybody.

170
00:15:20,891 --> 00:15:25,034
You could literally cast anyone with a great
voice who could act behind a mask, and there

171
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:30,638
you go. It does not have to be someone who was
notorious for making an insane amount of money

172
00:15:31,118 --> 00:15:37,115
on these Marvel films. It feels like creative
bankruptcy, right? You know... The MCU is kind

173
00:15:37,195 --> 00:15:41,378
of in shambles right now because over the past
couple years, they haven't been getting as

174
00:15:41,418 --> 00:15:47,223
much of a return on their films. So it's like
a big marketing move in that they're getting

175
00:15:47,263 --> 00:15:52,868
their biggest star back in an effort to entice
viewers back to the theater. But it's not the

176
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:57,111
right call. There are so many great actors out
there that could have played Doctor Doom that

177
00:15:57,131 --> 00:16:02,535
would have gotten me so excited. I did not watch
Marvel movies to see Robert Downey Jr. I watched

178
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:08,420
Marvel movies to see Tony Stark. And that's
all I'm gonna see when I'm watching Avengers

179
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:14,625
Doomsday, which can I just mention is a horrible
fucking title? Doomsday, really the Superman

180
00:16:14,645 --> 00:16:19,990
villain? I know it's not based off of that,
but it's like a movie coming out That's called

181
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:26,555
Justice League Dr. Doom Exactly. Well, they
should have just called it Avengers Doom. I

182
00:16:26,615 --> 00:16:31,779
think that would have been better Doomsday Yeah,
of course is a DC villain one of the most popular

183
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:35,989
DC villains, you know, the guy that fucking
killed Superman I just don't know what they're

184
00:16:36,009 --> 00:16:41,143
doing over at the MCU, especially with this
Robert Downey Jr. casting choice. And that

185
00:16:41,183 --> 00:16:42,487
brings us to our question of the week.

192
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:27,117
In DC news, in good news, we got to the official
trailer for Joker Folly I Do, the sequel to

193
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:31,820
the Joker film, which was fantastic. A lot of
people aren't looking forward to this Joker

194
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,802
sequel because they don't like the idea of a
musical, but the more I see from the movie,

195
00:17:35,942 --> 00:17:42,125
the more I'm falling in love with the concept,
the more I just am in awe of the cinematography

196
00:17:42,486 --> 00:17:46,768
and the acting performances that it looks like
we're going to get for this movie. It looks

197
00:17:46,788 --> 00:17:53,707
like it's going to be a masterpiece. Oh my God.
I'm sorry, what? Calm down, OK? It looks mid

198
00:17:53,847 --> 00:17:59,868
at best. Oh, my gosh. If this doesn't look like
a masterpiece, I don't know what a masterpiece

199
00:17:59,948 --> 00:18:06,990
looks like. And clearly, you don't either. Sure,
I do. Then it's OK. So then you recognize this

200
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:12,252
looks like one. No, it doesn't. Well, then you
don't know. You don't know what you're talking

201
00:18:12,272 --> 00:18:19,542
about. You could just sit this one out. The
the trailer starts off with. Arthur Fleck being

202
00:18:19,722 --> 00:18:24,806
escorted, I think, to a courtroom. And on the
radio, you hear different voices talking about

203
00:18:24,866 --> 00:18:29,269
him. The first time I watched this trailer,
I watched it without subtitles, which I like

204
00:18:29,289 --> 00:18:34,612
to do because sometimes subtitles can give away
different lines before you hear them. So I

205
00:18:34,632 --> 00:18:40,136
had no idea that one of those voices was Harvey
Dent. I had no idea Harvey Dent was going to

206
00:18:40,156 --> 00:18:45,980
be in this movie. That gets me so much more
pumped up to see it, because you have to imagine

207
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:51,719
if he's involved in the courtroom scenes. Something's
gonna happen to him. And that's gonna be wild

208
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:57,063
to see how that happens in this Joker universe,
because it's just so surprising and violent.

209
00:18:57,403 --> 00:19:01,005
Do you think Joker's gonna throw acid in his
face or something like that? I don't know,

210
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:05,447
him or Harley Quinn, maybe he gets shot in the
face. I have no idea. I just imagine it's gonna

211
00:19:05,487 --> 00:19:10,690
be very intense. We get to hear Joaquin Phoenix
singing for the first time in this movie, along

212
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:17,574
with Lady Gaga as well. They're not coming across
as like very polished singers. Which is interesting

213
00:19:17,594 --> 00:19:21,516
because I thought the musical numbers were going
to be much bigger. We haven't really seen anything

214
00:19:21,636 --> 00:19:26,419
like that yet in these trailers, though I do
imagine they will be in the film in Arthur's

215
00:19:26,479 --> 00:19:32,282
sort of imagined sequences in his mind. We see
a number of those sequences in this trailer,

216
00:19:32,302 --> 00:19:37,485
like when him and Harley are on stage or when
they're dancing in the courtroom or on the

217
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:43,268
rooftops and stuff like that. But in this trailer,
you also get a sense of the origin of how Harley

218
00:19:43,288 --> 00:19:48,747
Quinn became enamored with Arthur Fleck. You
know, she saw him on TV for the first time

219
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:54,572
and he spoke to her in the same way that the
Joker has spoken to a number of people, particularly

220
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:59,196
in Gotham City. But also you see that spilling
out into the real world, where in like political

221
00:19:59,236 --> 00:20:04,220
protests, you'll see people wearing Joker masks
or clown makeup in the same way that people

222
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:09,084
used to wear the Guy Fawkes mask from V for
Vendetta. But it's believable, you know, that

223
00:20:09,164 --> 00:20:14,368
someone like Harley Quinn would be influenced
by him. It does look like she is a patient

224
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:19,791
in Arkham Asylum. Though my theory is still
that she's manipulating the Joker. We'll see

225
00:20:19,831 --> 00:20:24,293
if that's a valid theory or not. She definitely
influences the Joker and makes him feel like

226
00:20:24,513 --> 00:20:29,795
he's a star if he didn't feel like that already.
And one of the guards played by Brendan Gleeson

227
00:20:30,256 --> 00:20:34,657
mentions that. And I think that totally makes
sense that the Joker would think that he was

228
00:20:34,677 --> 00:20:39,920
a star based on the ending of the first Joker
movie, how he just stood up on that police

229
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:45,778
car and felt like seen for the very first time.
He's conflating fame with infamy. Sort of.

230
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:51,182
Like people are influenced by him in this weird
way. And yeah, it could be infamous, the guy

231
00:20:51,423 --> 00:20:57,447
is a violent killer. But like, people were praising
him around that cop car. So he probably feels

232
00:20:57,467 --> 00:21:01,451
like he's doing the world a favor in some weird
way. I don't know, maybe drawing attention

233
00:21:01,531 --> 00:21:06,415
to people who feel unseen. I don't know. The
first movie of course was a sympathetic look

234
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:10,318
at the Joker. So I imagine they'll continue
to run with this. And that's kind of horrifying,

235
00:21:10,538 --> 00:21:16,430
I agree. But it makes for damn good cinema.
The music in this trailer. so damn good using

236
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:22,431
Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland. It really gives
you the vibe of what kind of musical numbers

237
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:27,873
they'll be doing in the movie, like these classic
mid-century tunes. They're just nailing the

238
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:35,895
tone. They're crushing the tone. All it is tone.
That's all it is. But damn, that tone, though.

239
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:40,356
Yeah, there's not much substance to these trailers.
You know, it's like you get a line here or

240
00:21:40,396 --> 00:21:46,771
there and then you get a crescendo swelling
of music. Yeah, and you see the Joker and makeup

241
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:49,912
and stuff like that and then you see the title
and then it's over like You really have no

242
00:21:49,992 --> 00:21:54,294
idea Too much of what the overall story is going
to be or how they're going to make it interesting

243
00:21:54,334 --> 00:22:01,157
like is it a trial movie? Uh, is it a romance?
All of the above who knows yes all of the above

244
00:22:01,317 --> 00:22:06,939
I imagine honestly I'm sold on tone like I don't
want to know too much of the story Like if

245
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:10,501
you can get me with the performances if you
could get me with the music if you could get

246
00:22:10,521 --> 00:22:15,723
me with a hint of a story If you could get me
with the revelation that Harvey Dent is going

247
00:22:15,743 --> 00:22:23,246
to be in this movie, you got me. Check your
expectations, man. Fuck you. It's too late.

248
00:22:23,466 --> 00:22:28,849
I'm too far gone. There's no hope. I just need
to see the movie. Well, it comes out in just

249
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:33,891
a little over two months and I will be there
day one. I honestly hope to get like an early

250
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:38,193
screening for this. I want to see as many times
as I can in theaters before we have to review

251
00:22:38,253 --> 00:22:42,824
it. And I'm really looking forward to it. Mind
you, you did not like the first Joker movie

252
00:22:42,864 --> 00:22:47,388
the first time you saw it. That's very true.
That's very true. You better watch yourself.

253
00:22:47,848 --> 00:22:53,673
This time I'm not going to take all my coworkers
so I can feel like uneasy and almost like embarrassed.

254
00:22:53,693 --> 00:22:58,897
It's just me going in. And I love how these
trailers are letting me know what to expect.

255
00:22:59,298 --> 00:23:03,341
Now, the Joker trailer came out before Comic-Con
so that it could play in front of the Deadpool

256
00:23:03,361 --> 00:23:09,102
movies at Comic-Con. There wasn't too much of
a presence from DC Studios. James Gunn wasn't

257
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:16,247
there, but he did record a video to unveil the
new logo for DC Studios and DC in general.

258
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:23,533
I say new, but it's really not. It's just a
return to the classic DC Bullet logo that was

259
00:23:23,573 --> 00:23:29,818
designed by the renowned graphic designer Milton
Glazer. Now let's be real, it's a step down

260
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:37,262
from what came previously. The existing DC Comics
logo. I thought was a great modern interpretation

261
00:23:37,422 --> 00:23:42,745
of the bullet logo. You know, it simplified
it and made it really clean and bold. Returning

262
00:23:42,765 --> 00:23:49,367
to the logo that they used in the 80s and 90s
seems dumb. Which was my initial reaction because

263
00:23:49,467 --> 00:23:53,949
I was under the impression that it was only
DC studios that was going to be using this

264
00:23:53,989 --> 00:23:58,631
logo and not the comics, not the merch, not
the video games or anything else. Which I thought

265
00:23:58,651 --> 00:24:05,134
was really bad for brand synergy. Like you don't
want one division using one logo for DC and

266
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:12,497
other divisions not using that same logo. I
do really like DC's most recent logo. I agree

267
00:24:12,517 --> 00:24:17,439
with you. I thought it was a great interpretation
of not only the DC bullet, but a lot of other

268
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:24,642
logos from DC's past. It was perfection in my
opinion. That said, my second favorite DC logo

269
00:24:25,002 --> 00:24:29,144
is absolutely the bullet. It's the one that
was around when I first started reading comics.

270
00:24:29,304 --> 00:24:34,354
So I don't know if nostalgia plays a factor,
but yeah, the design is not bad. Well, I mean,

271
00:24:34,394 --> 00:24:39,939
it's inferior, but I understand why they needed
to do this because they needed to make it clear

272
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:44,624
to the general public that DC is moving in a
new direction, that they're like establishing

273
00:24:44,664 --> 00:24:50,489
a new cinematic universe and whatnot. But the
issue is that DC has rebranded like 50 fucking

274
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:56,415
times in the last couple of decades. Yeah. You
had the swoosh logo. You had the stupid like

275
00:24:56,515 --> 00:25:02,055
fold over logo. That was a really bad logo.
But then you also had the most recent modern

276
00:25:02,115 --> 00:25:06,939
DC logo, which was fantastic. Because of all
these changes, I think DC knew that they couldn't

277
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:12,503
really afford to go in another new direction
and still maintain that solid brand awareness.

278
00:25:13,023 --> 00:25:17,366
In that regard, they had to go back to something
that had come previously, and so they went

279
00:25:17,386 --> 00:25:23,791
with their classic logo. Something that is arguably
more iconic. When I talk to people about DC

280
00:25:23,831 --> 00:25:29,395
comics, I talk about Watchmen, I talk about
Dark Knight Returns. All of these things came

281
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:36,944
out during the DC Bullet logo era, so it's not
surprising that they would want to remind people

282
00:25:37,104 --> 00:25:42,290
of that and be like, hey, remember when you
loved DC Comics? Well, get ready to love it

283
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:47,556
again, because here we are. I do agree that
they probably wanted something new. I don't

284
00:25:47,576 --> 00:25:51,527
know if they needed it. But yeah, you're right.
It would have signaled to everyone that, hey,

285
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:55,588
this is a brand new era. And there's a lot of
different companies who are going back to their

286
00:25:55,688 --> 00:26:00,050
old retro logos. Like fast food chains like
Pizza Hut and Burger King. You know, they're

287
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:05,892
all going back to the 70s and 80s. So, you know,
I guess it's just DC's turn. I don't love it.

288
00:26:05,992 --> 00:26:10,394
I wish it never happened. But if it had to happen,
you could have done worse logos than the bullet.

289
00:26:10,834 --> 00:26:14,356
All I know is that Marvel better not do this
shit because I'll be pissed. What? You don't

290
00:26:14,376 --> 00:26:19,150
like the classic Marvel logo with the lettering
on top of the giant and with yellow? comics

291
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:23,753
written across it? It's fine. You know, that's
the logo that they had when I grew up reading

292
00:26:23,773 --> 00:26:27,616
the comics and everything like that, but it's
been improved upon and I don't want to see

293
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:34,081
them doing a DC. Oh, you mean being badass?
No, I mean fucking up. You guys are fucking

294
00:26:34,101 --> 00:26:40,205
up plenty. Don't. Exactly. Don't act like you're
not. Speaking of fucking up, back to Marvel

295
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:45,289
news, we got the first subtitle announced for
the Fantastic Four movie. A lot of us just

296
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:50,910
thought that. This upcoming MCU Fantastic Four
film would just be called Fantastic Four or

297
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:56,435
The Fantastic Four. But no, it's going to be
called Fantastic Four First Steps. And the

298
00:26:56,715 --> 00:27:03,001
title treatment kind of makes it seem like a
kid's cartoon. And I understand that's probably

299
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:09,507
due in part to the 60s sitcom vibe that they're
kind of going with. But I don't know why they

300
00:27:09,547 --> 00:27:13,890
needed a subtitle for this movie. It makes it
sound like. Fantastic Four are learning how

301
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:18,474
to walk. Now, the only way that this subtitle
works, I think, and really it could work on

302
00:27:18,534 --> 00:27:23,798
multiple levels. First Steps could allude to
the Fantastic Four taking their first steps

303
00:27:23,838 --> 00:27:28,061
on the moon or something like that. If in fact,
you know, this is the 60s and part of their

304
00:27:28,162 --> 00:27:32,525
space exploration where they run into their
cosmic ray accident is part of the space race

305
00:27:32,845 --> 00:27:37,289
or something like that. I can see that working.
But I think more than that, in order for this

306
00:27:37,309 --> 00:27:42,228
subtitle to work... A big part of the storyline
needs to revolve around Reed and Sue becoming

307
00:27:42,308 --> 00:27:47,993
parents for the first time. Because then you
have first steps alluding to Franklin and maybe

308
00:27:48,033 --> 00:27:52,976
Valeria as well, as their children taking their
first steps. I feel like Valeria is a bit of

309
00:27:52,996 --> 00:27:57,980
a stretch, maybe all you need is Franklin, but
even then that seems really soon. I guess it

310
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,144
is a way to differentiate this Fantastic Four
film from other Fantastic Four films in that

311
00:28:03,424 --> 00:28:08,843
Reed and Sue would become parents and maybe
make this film feel more family oriented. So

312
00:28:08,863 --> 00:28:13,726
it's not a terrible idea. I just don't think
it needed the subtitle. It didn't. I'm not.

313
00:28:13,786 --> 00:28:18,349
I'm not a fan of the subtitle. Fantastic for
first steps. I don't ever want to call it that.

314
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:23,972
OK, can I just say that Marvel has really been
sucking lately when it comes to subtitles?

315
00:28:24,492 --> 00:28:31,997
I think it started with homecoming. I was like,
what? Homecoming? No, just stop with the sucky

316
00:28:32,217 --> 00:28:38,503
ass subtitles. Give us like real subtitles that
we actually want. You know, Brave New World

317
00:28:38,583 --> 00:28:44,244
is not a bad one, but Asterisk? I guess that's
not really a subtitle. It's just it's just

318
00:28:44,365 --> 00:28:48,686
weird. Are you talking about the Asterisk that
comes at the end of the Thunderbolts title?

319
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:53,487
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, who knows what's going on
there? That's weird. I feel like I'm complaining

320
00:28:53,507 --> 00:28:58,248
a lot for a subtitle, but it just confuses me
and I hate being confused. And people really

321
00:28:58,268 --> 00:29:03,046
shouldn't be confused at this stage in Marvel
because they need wins. Like they can't really

322
00:29:03,086 --> 00:29:09,091
afford bad news. I mean, maybe they can because
Deadpool and Wolverine totally killed, but

323
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:14,915
that could be forgotten so easily with one more
bad Marvel movie. Yeah, Goodwill only lasts

324
00:29:15,035 --> 00:29:20,239
as long as your most recent announcement or
decision or movie. You know, I've been online

325
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:25,002
a lot and it seems like the majority opinions
regarding the first step subtitle and Robert

326
00:29:25,022 --> 00:29:30,806
Downey Jr.'s return as Dr. Doom are mostly negative,
and deservedly so. I hope Marvel listens to

327
00:29:30,826 --> 00:29:37,368
the fans because making them happy is how they
make money. You know what makes me happy? The

328
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:42,149
new Penguin trailer. Everyone who's been listening
to the podcast knows that I love the Batman,

329
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:47,851
that I've really been looking forward to this
show and how it expands the world of Matt Reeves

330
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:52,972
the Batman. I think Colin Farrell totally nailed
the performance of the Penguin. I still can't

331
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:59,090
believe it's him in this role. And it looks
like this show is going to be one epic. crime

332
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:03,952
drama of how the Penguin rises to power. We
see him being heavily influenced by his mother

333
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:08,393
in this trailer who makes him feel like he should
be the one in charge of Gotham's underworld.

334
00:30:08,734 --> 00:30:13,896
And the trailer does a really good job of making
the Penguin appear like a threat. You see him

335
00:30:13,956 --> 00:30:19,398
freaking stab someone, you see him shoot people
with machine guns, you see him plow into people

336
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:24,100
with his car. It's freaking crazy. Yeah it looks
a lot more violent and action heavy than most

337
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:28,778
other crime shows and films. Like something
like the Sopranos. Sure it's but I wouldn't

338
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,861
say there's a lot of action. The Penguin seems
to have a lot of action. Yeah, I think we mentioned

339
00:30:33,901 --> 00:30:40,204
that in our review of the last trailer that
they put out and how the explosions and stuff

340
00:30:40,324 --> 00:30:47,328
sets a step above, action-wise, other crime
dramas that you see on networks like HBO. This

341
00:30:47,368 --> 00:30:52,051
is grounded, but it's still very much oriented
in that comic book world. Yeah, it looks more

342
00:30:52,071 --> 00:30:57,126
like Heat as opposed to something like The Wire.
Yeah, yeah, I could see that. This trailer

343
00:30:57,166 --> 00:31:02,809
also gives us a really good idea of who is going
to be Oswald's main antagonist in the show,

344
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:07,872
and that's going to be Sophia Falcone, the daughter
of Carline Falcone, who we saw get shot and

345
00:31:07,892 --> 00:31:12,494
killed in the Batman movie. It looks like both
of those characters are going to be fighting

346
00:31:12,534 --> 00:31:16,877
to see who comes out on top and rule Gotham's
criminal underworld, but the wrench thrown

347
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:22,040
into the mix is that Sophia Falcone was apparently
an inmate at Arkham, which definitely makes

348
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,862
things interesting. It looks like we're going
to get to see the inside of Arkham. and I'm

349
00:31:25,902 --> 00:31:29,843
wondering who else we're gonna see there. Maybe
we'll see the Riddler, maybe we'll see the

350
00:31:29,883 --> 00:31:34,144
Joker again. Maybe, that would be incredible,
it's probably unlikely, that feels like a pipe

351
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:39,685
dream, but who knows. We got to a release date
with this trailer, finally. It's going to be

352
00:31:39,725 --> 00:31:45,647
debuting on HBO, they're really branding it
with HBO instead of Just Max, on September

353
00:31:45,727 --> 00:31:50,928
19th. Do you know how many episodes it's gonna
be? Eight episodes. So we'll be reviewing this

354
00:31:50,988 --> 00:31:56,923
like in mid-November. Also coming out this year
in December, is Creature Commandos, which we

355
00:31:56,963 --> 00:32:02,988
got the first teaser trailer for during Comic-Con.
Of course, this is the first official project

356
00:32:03,408 --> 00:32:08,773
in James Gunn's DCU Cinematic Universe, but
it really looks like it's stemming off of the

357
00:32:08,813 --> 00:32:15,318
events that happened in Peacemaker Season 1,
with the outing of Amanda Waller as the head

358
00:32:15,358 --> 00:32:20,522
of Task Force X, and it looks like here she's
kind of doing more of the same, except instead

359
00:32:20,562 --> 00:32:27,880
of creating a Suicide Squad, she's creating
the Task Force M, which is somewhat in keeping

360
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:32,803
with the comics. They didn't call it Task Force
M there, but they called it Project M. Interesting.

361
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:37,927
The show looks really good, actually. I was
kind of blown away by how quirky everything

362
00:32:37,967 --> 00:32:43,591
feels, how great the animation was, and how
cool the character designs are. And the voice

363
00:32:43,631 --> 00:32:48,734
cast is awesome. And the great thing is that
the cast will also be playing live action versions

364
00:32:48,794 --> 00:32:54,526
of these characters in the films. So you have
David Harbour as Frankenstein. You have Sean

365
00:32:54,566 --> 00:32:59,949
Gunn as Weasel, who of course played the character
in The Suicide Squad, directed by James Gunn

366
00:32:59,969 --> 00:33:05,792
a few years ago. Alan Tudyk is Dr. Phosphorus.
Indira Varma is The Bride. But of course, you

367
00:33:05,812 --> 00:33:11,655
also have Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, Frank
Girlo as Rick Flagg Sr. and Steve Agge, who's

368
00:33:11,715 --> 00:33:16,738
returning as John Economus. The teaser trailer
we got was not very long. It was only a minute

369
00:33:16,758 --> 00:33:21,961
and 30 seconds. We didn't get a great idea of
what the story is, but it looks to be in keeping

370
00:33:22,261 --> 00:33:28,673
pretty much with The Suicide Squad just a little
bit more monstrous as it were. Well, it sounds

371
00:33:28,693 --> 00:33:33,797
like they're fighting Nazis according to GI
Robots line. Right, yeah. I love the fact that

372
00:33:33,837 --> 00:33:37,960
these characters are getting their own show.
The Creature Commandos have always been a really

373
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,744
cool team to me and I love the fact that James
Gunn is kind of continuing his Suicide Squad

374
00:33:43,844 --> 00:33:49,568
kind of zany character team group dynamic because
he did a phenomenal job with the Suicide Squad

375
00:33:49,608 --> 00:33:53,687
film. Again, the show is coming out in December.
I'm not sure how many episodes there are for

376
00:33:53,747 --> 00:33:57,071
it, but we're definitely going to review it.
Well, if it starts in December, it's probably

377
00:33:57,091 --> 00:34:01,616
going to lead into January, which means that
the show probably won't qualify for a Brothers

378
00:34:01,656 --> 00:34:06,341
Award. It'll probably go into the 2025 awards.
Oh yeah, it's definitely going into January.

379
00:34:06,421 --> 00:34:06,861
Absolutely.

380
00:34:13,998 --> 00:34:17,582
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and get into

381
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:23,909
our main event where we review the latest Marvel
Studios movie release, Deadpool and Wolverine.

382
00:34:39,138 --> 00:34:43,660
All right, Deadpool and Wolverine was directed
by Sean Levy and stars Ryan Reynolds, Hugh

383
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:49,403
Jackman, Emma Corrin and Matthew McFadden. It's
one of the most anticipated movies of the year,

384
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:54,886
the only film that Marvel Studios is releasing
this year. But did it deliver on the hype and

385
00:34:54,926 --> 00:35:02,050
expectations? Well, John, Adam, what do you
guys think? I would say it did. Not just did

386
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:09,594
it, it massively lived up to the hype, my man.
Welcome back to the show, guys. Longtime listeners

387
00:35:09,614 --> 00:35:14,018
will know John and Adam Spies. They were the
hosts of the blast from our past podcast. They

388
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:18,721
are the hosts of the throwback trivia take down
podcast. And longtime listeners know them from

389
00:35:18,781 --> 00:35:24,266
our reviews of X-Men Origins Wolverine, Batman
Forever and Batman the Movie. Both of them

390
00:35:24,506 --> 00:35:29,590
have been or are executive producers of Dynamic
Duel. They are the self professed biggest Deadpool

391
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:34,894
fans in the world. And I believe it. And they
are also the most requested guests. from our

392
00:35:34,954 --> 00:35:39,276
fans. To this day, people still ask when we're
going to do another review with Adam and John.

393
00:35:39,897 --> 00:35:44,579
And I couldn't think of a better movie than
the one that probably ends the journey that

394
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:50,303
was started with X-Men Origins Wolverine. John,
Adam, glad to have you guys. How you guys been

395
00:35:50,343 --> 00:35:55,266
doing? Been doing great. We just both had to
body slide over from the BeFop Network podcast

396
00:35:55,306 --> 00:35:59,188
verse, if you will. We've been doing great.
We actually got to hang out with y'all just

397
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:04,359
a couple of weeks ago, which was wonderful in
person. I was very excited for you all to invite

398
00:36:04,499 --> 00:36:10,562
us for this amazing movie, which I have no doubt
will be the first six of all time on your ratings.

399
00:36:10,682 --> 00:36:14,964
Six out of five. That's obvious. So I want to
jump in real quick and give a quick spoiler

400
00:36:14,984 --> 00:36:19,626
warning to the listeners. This is a spoiler
review. So don't like ruin the surprises for

401
00:36:19,646 --> 00:36:23,748
yourself. If you haven't seen the movie yet,
definitely go see the movie. It's absolutely

402
00:36:23,828 --> 00:36:29,471
worth the ticket price. Like regardless of end
quality. The movie itself is a big deal in

403
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:33,593
that it brought Hugh Jackman out of retirement,
who had hung up his claws about seven years

404
00:36:33,633 --> 00:36:39,977
ago after the Logan movie. John Adam, I want
to get real quick your reactions to the Deadpool

405
00:36:40,037 --> 00:36:44,639
3 announcement teaser that Ryan Reynolds did
that announced that Wolverine would be in the

406
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:51,663
movie. I mean, I was as pleasantly surprised
as everyone else. I didn't think it was something

407
00:36:51,683 --> 00:36:57,962
that was beyond the realm of possibility because,
you know, money talks. and never say never.

408
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:03,125
Patrick Stewart also said that he would never
play Professor X again and then we saw him

409
00:37:03,225 --> 00:37:08,328
a few years later in Multiverse of Madness.
So the truth is, is any story that's worth

410
00:37:08,368 --> 00:37:15,152
their weight is gonna entice an actor to any
role regardless. I mean, even I heard James

411
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:20,675
McAvoy was asked, you know, would you ever return?
He said, listen, if the story is there, if

412
00:37:20,715 --> 00:37:26,326
it's a story worth telling, I'm in. And I think
especially, actors who have been around for

413
00:37:26,347 --> 00:37:33,433
a while where maybe money isn't necessarily
the biggest draw, it's creativity. If you come

414
00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:39,077
to them with something really good, they're
probably in. I came in with a whole heart of

415
00:37:39,197 --> 00:37:44,082
optimism. I mean obviously with Deadpool in
the comics, him and Wolverine have a very interesting

416
00:37:44,142 --> 00:37:49,026
relationship. It's not that buddy-buddy relationship
that he had with Cable, which honestly I think

417
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:54,802
they botched in Deadpool 2 a little bit. I did
not like Cable being as... kill hungry as he

418
00:37:54,862 --> 00:38:01,327
as he was in that movie. But time and time again
in Deadpool one and two, Hugh Jackman and Wolverine

419
00:38:01,668 --> 00:38:05,811
was brought up by Deadpool like, you know, that
first movie you take the mask off, you see

420
00:38:05,831 --> 00:38:11,335
the Hugh Jackman mask on top. He was obviously
a driving factor for creativity for Ryan Reynolds.

421
00:38:11,355 --> 00:38:16,459
And so seeing them sitting together, him walking
behind, you know, oh, hey, Hugh, you in for

422
00:38:16,499 --> 00:38:20,986
it? And he's like, yeah, sure. Chills, man.
It got me super excited. That's not without

423
00:38:21,026 --> 00:38:27,028
hesitation because we all saw Logan and Logan
is a phenomenal film. Could they make it work?

424
00:38:27,068 --> 00:38:31,330
It's all about the story. Yeah, for sure. That
totally makes sense. I remember seeing that

425
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:36,372
announcement trailer a couple of years ago and
just being pumped, like bouncing off the walls.

426
00:38:36,652 --> 00:38:40,694
Just I think I'm still writing the energy from
that announcement. And it's definitely taking

427
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:45,756
me through all the disappointing comic news,
the fact that this movie was good. And I definitely

428
00:38:45,776 --> 00:38:51,099
think lived up to the expectations because.
My big takeaway from the movie was that it

429
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:57,804
110% delivered on the dynamic between the main
characters and gave us scenes that we've always

430
00:38:57,984 --> 00:39:02,367
wanted to see as fans and even some scenes that
we never knew we always wanted to see. It's

431
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:06,790
so weird because Ryan Reynolds, he definitely
has his finger on the pulse marketing-wise

432
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:12,254
in terms of like what fans want. Like this is
the movie that Doctor Strange and the Multiverse

433
00:39:12,274 --> 00:39:16,877
of Madness should have been. This is the multiverse
movie that all of the fans have been asking

434
00:39:16,917 --> 00:39:21,036
for. They delivered in such a big way with all
the different cameos and stuff like that. Yeah,

435
00:39:21,056 --> 00:39:25,238
it was ironic that at the end of the film, Deadpool
was like, can we cool it with the multiverse

436
00:39:25,258 --> 00:39:30,041
thing? When, you know, in reality, he's probably
done it better than any other film has thus

437
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:34,083
far. It's one of those kind of things where
because they did so well in this film, it kind

438
00:39:34,103 --> 00:39:37,905
of adds validation to some of the older ones.
Go like, OK, I kind of had to sift through

439
00:39:37,925 --> 00:39:43,008
the shit to get to where it actually makes sense.
For sure. Yeah, like 20 years of shit. Right.

440
00:39:43,168 --> 00:39:47,916
I mean, like they went back to the Electra movie.
They went back to the Fantastic Four movie.

441
00:39:48,436 --> 00:39:52,160
They gave us the Channing Tatum Gambit movie
that we never actually got to see that was

442
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:56,825
canceled. And their writing and the allusions
to that, you know, the meta side of that was

443
00:39:56,925 --> 00:40:02,590
so perfectly done. And something you could only
have done in a Deadpool movie. Any other movie,

444
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:07,215
it doesn't make sense. It seems cheesy. This
movie, it works. Right. Yeah. All those like

445
00:40:07,315 --> 00:40:11,730
meta in jokes where you not only have to know.
The films themselves were probably some of

446
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:16,351
the behind the scenes stuff as well, like how
Wesley Snipes was not a fan of Ryan Reynolds.

447
00:40:16,731 --> 00:40:20,152
And he was like, I don't like you. And then
this movie is like, he never did. That was

448
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:24,614
so good. Like in a way, this movie almost makes
Blade Trinity better because it gives you some

449
00:40:24,654 --> 00:40:29,215
closure to that whole shit storm. And like it
never felt good watching Blade Trinity, not

450
00:40:29,235 --> 00:40:32,556
only because it wasn't a good movie, but because
you knew all the behind the scenes drama and

451
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:36,957
stuff like that. So it was nice to get a lot
of closure. And I think that's one of the best

452
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:41,410
things that this movie has going for it. In
addition. to all the fan service. But speaking

453
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:46,893
of the fan service, how did you guys feel about
the movie leaving the theater? I had a shit

454
00:40:46,953 --> 00:40:51,895
eating grin from beginning to end. First time
I saw it, I saw it with my wife and we walked

455
00:40:51,935 --> 00:40:57,277
out. And she, who knows very little, she knows
basically just from marrying me, you know,

456
00:40:57,357 --> 00:41:02,779
some tiny things about Deadpool. And she enjoyed
the film. And I just turned her I said, I fucking

457
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:08,161
loved that. And then the second time I went
with a buddy from work, who is a huge Batman

458
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:14,224
fan. And we've had some fun little Deadpool
versus Batman things. And I talked to him and

459
00:41:14,285 --> 00:41:18,747
I was like, so what do you think? He was like,
yeah, that's better than any Batman recent

460
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:25,691
Batman movie. And I'm like, fuck yeah, it is.
No lie. No, it's better. It's better than anything

461
00:41:25,711 --> 00:41:30,554
you've had recently. I mean, because it's just
a fun film and you're getting more for like

462
00:41:30,834 --> 00:41:35,557
the extra nerds like us who have read comics
and know enough about extra things. But because

463
00:41:35,737 --> 00:41:41,296
it just brings the fun. I couldn't help but
be in a state of euphoria at the end of this

464
00:41:41,316 --> 00:41:45,538
film both times. I mean, I really don't have
too much to add. That's basically how I was.

465
00:41:45,558 --> 00:41:49,540
I saw it Friday morning, I saw it Saturday morning.
Friday morning I left it and all I could do

466
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:53,243
the rest of the day was think about it. And
I finally told my wife, I said, I got to go

467
00:41:53,263 --> 00:41:57,885
back. I got to go back and watch it again. So
my son and I went back the second time. And

468
00:41:58,205 --> 00:42:02,588
I told my son as soon as we walked out, I said,
I think I liked that even more the second time

469
00:42:02,668 --> 00:42:06,710
I went in, even already knowing what was going
to happen. I would agree. I think actually

470
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:12,572
seeing the second time, I felt like I was able
to absorb maybe even more of a wider picture

471
00:42:12,873 --> 00:42:17,494
because I'm not trying to take in so much detail.
Yeah, there was a lot in this movie. I remember

472
00:42:17,594 --> 00:42:22,136
my first reaction coming out of the theater
was texting Joseph, letting him know, hey dude,

473
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:28,799
you need to see this movie more than once. I
think my biggest takeaway coming out too was

474
00:42:29,059 --> 00:42:35,194
just how much of a fan service movie this was
and how rewarding it was to see as a fan. because

475
00:42:35,214 --> 00:42:40,116
you got so much more out of it. My wife went
to go see it with me as well and she enjoyed

476
00:42:40,176 --> 00:42:43,958
it. But I just know that I got so much more
out of it because I understood all of the different

477
00:42:44,018 --> 00:42:49,221
references and meta jokes and stuff like that.
And it's probably the most rewarding film in

478
00:42:49,241 --> 00:42:53,303
terms of fan service than anything else that
has ever existed. It's like even more than

479
00:42:53,444 --> 00:43:00,908
Endgame. Definitely more than The Flash, for
sure. Hey, hey. OK. My big takeaway walking

480
00:43:00,928 --> 00:43:04,822
out of the movie was, I mean, I was entirely
pleased with what they had done here. I did

481
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:10,546
feel like there was a story structural problem
that Deadpool 2 had as well where there were

482
00:43:10,606 --> 00:43:16,189
almost four acts or more of like a prequel as
it were. Everything kind of felt more episodic

483
00:43:16,249 --> 00:43:20,652
or like a series of comic issues than it did
like a typical narrative structure. Why is

484
00:43:20,692 --> 00:43:25,916
that a problem? It does make the film feel a
little bit long and I think that moment at

485
00:43:25,956 --> 00:43:29,759
the end when Deadpool's like hang tight folks
were almost there, at that moment I was like

486
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:33,961
okay, yeah, I am kind of feeling that. Because
you had what felt like a big third act fight.

487
00:43:34,346 --> 00:43:40,848
with the resistance against Kuzantronova's army.
And then you had almost an epilogue going back

488
00:43:40,888 --> 00:43:45,230
to Deadpool's universe. You had the Deadpool
core fight. And then even after that, you had

489
00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:49,812
the big sacrifice to destroy the time ripper
machine. So it felt episodic. There was a lot

490
00:43:49,832 --> 00:43:55,755
of sequences strung together as opposed to watching
a singular movie narrative. I will say this,

491
00:43:56,015 --> 00:44:00,737
the first time I watched it, I felt that, I
felt the length. The second time I watched

492
00:44:00,797 --> 00:44:05,993
it, went by like that. Absolutely. I completely
agree. And I think that has to do with you

493
00:44:06,013 --> 00:44:09,836
already having the right expectations for what
the story is going to be. Yeah. So, yeah, I

494
00:44:09,876 --> 00:44:13,600
definitely didn't mind that as much the second
time I watched the movie. And each of those

495
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,424
beats gave you something exciting, gave you
something fun. Because, yeah, you had that

496
00:44:18,504 --> 00:44:24,249
climactic, you know, oh my God, Blade and Electra
and Gambit are all kind of getting their hero

497
00:44:24,309 --> 00:44:28,133
moment. And that's cathartic. And then you're
like, okay, oh shit, I'm still going on a journey

498
00:44:28,153 --> 00:44:31,726
here. But then you're getting that. bus fight
in that Deadpool core fight, which is incredible.

499
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:35,628
And then you're like, OK, shit, we are still
going here. But then you have the emotional

500
00:44:35,668 --> 00:44:40,510
tie of their kind of sacrifice, which wasn't
a sacrifice, but I'm that didn't bother me,

501
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:45,992
honestly, because it works for Deadpool. But
that emotional moment, it hits you in a lot

502
00:44:46,012 --> 00:44:50,154
of different fields. Like this film did a great
job, even though I agree. I'm actually with

503
00:44:50,194 --> 00:44:53,915
you guys 100 percent, where it kind of felt
like, OK, we got another thing to conclude

504
00:44:53,976 --> 00:44:59,342
and then another thing to conclude. But I got
satisfied conclusions from each of them. Yeah,

505
00:44:59,682 --> 00:45:03,843
the good thing about the sort of episodic nature
of the story is that you got a lot of great

506
00:45:03,903 --> 00:45:08,645
moments at the end of each like little beat,
right? There are so many moments in this movie

507
00:45:08,666 --> 00:45:13,107
that will be contenders for the Brothers Awards
that we do at the end of the year. You know,

508
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:16,709
there was the scene where they're sacrificing
themselves listening to Madonna. Like I got

509
00:45:16,749 --> 00:45:20,831
chills. I got teary like watching those moments
of them thinking of like their entire arcs

510
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:24,512
culminating in that moment thinking they're
about to die. I got chills during the Deadpool

511
00:45:24,532 --> 00:45:29,034
core fight scene. What was your favorite moment
from? the movie, would you say, if you had

512
00:45:29,054 --> 00:45:35,018
to pick one? I want to say the one that got
the biggest reaction from me in the theater

513
00:45:35,258 --> 00:45:40,521
was the bait and switch of Chris Evans. Yep.
Was the Captain America to flame when he said

514
00:45:40,561 --> 00:45:44,863
flame on. I about shit myself because that's
I mean, they did such a great job of peppering

515
00:45:44,923 --> 00:45:49,946
in Captain America multiple times before. And
Deadpool's love of him, which is pretty comic

516
00:45:50,006 --> 00:45:55,789
accurate. And then, oh, my God, yes, it's Cap.
And then, oh, it's not. And I just I was floored.

517
00:45:56,094 --> 00:46:00,077
I fucking died in the theater and I can't believe
I didn't see it coming. Yeah. But right when

518
00:46:00,097 --> 00:46:04,100
you get that reveal, that's when you figure
out, oh, I know exactly what this movie is

519
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:08,244
going to be here, at least in the void setting.
Yes. It's just going to be a ton of cameos

520
00:46:08,324 --> 00:46:13,708
and all this just so much fun, just so much
fanboy excitement. Like I definitely had to

521
00:46:13,728 --> 00:46:21,034
grab my special sock. Yeah. It was so good.
I didn't think in a million years that Chris

522
00:46:21,094 --> 00:46:26,446
Evans would be playing Johnny Storm again. It
was so good. I... I wouldn't say that it was

523
00:46:26,506 --> 00:46:32,350
spoiled for me, but I'd heard numerous people
say, hey, he could come back as Johnny Storm

524
00:46:32,410 --> 00:46:36,753
because they're doing this here. So that was
kind of in the back of my mind. It was still

525
00:46:36,773 --> 00:46:42,337
a surprise, but I was like, oh, of course they
did this because it's the funny thing to do.

526
00:46:42,897 --> 00:46:48,001
The thing that got the biggest reaction out
of me, other than the initial very first trailer,

527
00:46:48,561 --> 00:46:53,084
I didn't watch anything. I didn't watch anything
else. I did have a couple of things spoiled

528
00:46:53,124 --> 00:46:57,851
for me just because social media sucks. Big
time. X23 was spoiled for me, and that was

529
00:46:57,871 --> 00:47:02,154
without having seen the trailer. I really was
disappointed that they spoiled that. The thing

530
00:47:02,174 --> 00:47:06,817
that got the biggest reaction out of me was
Wesley Snipes. Oh, yeah, that shocked the hell

531
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:11,300
out of me. I literally shouted, holy shit, in
the theater right next to my 14 year old son,

532
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:15,322
who surprisingly didn't hear me because everyone
else in the theater was also yelling, holy

533
00:47:15,382 --> 00:47:20,305
shit. It was one collective holy shit. Uh-huh.
So Wesley Snipes was actually spoiled for me.

534
00:47:20,658 --> 00:47:25,159
And I messaged you guys on Facebook Messenger.
I said, stay off the goddamn internet because

535
00:47:25,399 --> 00:47:30,460
there are spoilers out there. I had opened up
Instagram and I saw the clip of Wesley Snipes

536
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,602
and it was unforgivable. At that point, I just
completely like did not get on Instagram or

537
00:47:35,642 --> 00:47:39,643
anything until I saw the movie. It was a great
feeling. It was another kind of like chills

538
00:47:39,663 --> 00:47:45,344
down the back. Like, oh, my God, he's back.
Oh, my God. Where's my white pants? It was

539
00:47:45,484 --> 00:47:52,511
exactly because we're never fucking getting
Mahershala Ali. I know, it's like 10 years

540
00:47:52,531 --> 00:47:56,973
in the making now already almost. But I'm excited
for Mahershala Ali's. I thought it was a great

541
00:47:57,013 --> 00:48:00,795
meta joke when Wesley Snipes was like, it's
only one blade and there's only gonna be one

542
00:48:00,815 --> 00:48:05,758
blade. It was so good. I was like, I hope that's
not actually true because we gotta get that

543
00:48:05,798 --> 00:48:10,981
Mahershala Ali movie. I already knew that Elektra
was gonna be in the film because that was revealed

544
00:48:11,021 --> 00:48:15,183
by the trades back when she was actually cast.
But I did not know that Channing Tatum was

545
00:48:15,203 --> 00:48:20,306
gonna be in the movie. What was your reaction
to Channing Tatum's look, accent, all I would

546
00:48:20,326 --> 00:48:26,007
say pleasantly surprised. I felt like his headpiece
was a little thick. That part took a little

547
00:48:26,027 --> 00:48:29,328
way for it. Also, I don't think his hair was
big enough. I feel like his hair needed to

548
00:48:29,348 --> 00:48:35,150
be bigger, taller. There needed to be more.
His accent I thought was fine. It's not an

549
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:42,192
easy accent to do unless you're a native speaker.
So the shock of him being in it was fun. It

550
00:48:42,212 --> 00:48:47,173
was the fun surprise. It wasn't the holy shit
surprise that Blade was, but it was the fun

551
00:48:47,193 --> 00:48:51,874
surprise of like, oh, we get to do this. This
is cool. I thought what they did with the visual

552
00:48:51,914 --> 00:48:57,357
effects with his cards was cool. I thought his
fighting was fine. I thought the lines he had

553
00:48:57,397 --> 00:49:01,859
to say was fine. Like I said, I thought his
accent was fine. It wasn't perfect. But the

554
00:49:01,879 --> 00:49:04,920
thing that took me, not out of it, but the thing
that bothered me the most was I thought the

555
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:09,202
headpiece was too thick. For some reason, that
kind of bothered me. Yeah. I always think of

556
00:49:09,242 --> 00:49:15,225
Gambit as just having a very gaunt facial structure.
And when you combine Chyney Tatum's rounder

557
00:49:15,265 --> 00:49:18,738
face, especially as he gets older... with that
headpiece. I just wish they got rid of the

558
00:49:18,758 --> 00:49:22,540
headpiece. I think it would have been fine just
with the jacket. I agree. Or make it may have

559
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:26,902
a cloth. It didn't have to be out of leather.
Yeah. Or a rubber or whatever it was. I thought

560
00:49:26,982 --> 00:49:32,504
that moment of Channing Tatum in there was another
perfect moment for us, the extra nerds, the

561
00:49:32,544 --> 00:49:37,726
people who really have given in the time to
not just watch all the movies and shows because

562
00:49:37,746 --> 00:49:41,328
we've all done that. And so many people have
done that. But the people who know, oh, this

563
00:49:41,348 --> 00:49:44,609
is the extra stuff that we know this is going
to happen or that, you know, all this stuff

564
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:50,265
is rumored, etc, etc. This was for the real
deep cut people. And when he was talking, I

565
00:49:50,345 --> 00:49:55,149
loved his bad accent. I mean, it wasn't even
that bad. But I know because even when you

566
00:49:55,189 --> 00:50:01,074
watch X-Men 97 and you know that stuff, it's
a real hard accent and even rogues is that

567
00:50:01,114 --> 00:50:05,578
Louisiana accent's real fucking tough to do.
And so them just making fun of it. And also

568
00:50:05,598 --> 00:50:09,641
the meta jokes of your fourth wall breaks of
who's your dialect coach, like all that stuff.

569
00:50:09,961 --> 00:50:16,038
I thought it played off exactly the way a Deadpool
movie can do it in a very interesting and funny

570
00:50:16,078 --> 00:50:20,259
and met away. But like my wife, who was sitting
next to me, had no idea. Like, well, why the

571
00:50:20,279 --> 00:50:23,200
hell is Channing Tatum in this? And I was like,
well, you see, you see, because he was cast

572
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:27,081
and he was supposed to be in it. And like all
the jokes of him, like, yeah. And I some people

573
00:50:27,121 --> 00:50:30,222
feel like they were born in the void. And I'm
like, because he never got the movie, honey.

574
00:50:30,302 --> 00:50:36,343
Do you get it? Like that was great for us. It
was for that extra level of deep nerd that

575
00:50:36,563 --> 00:50:41,325
even just the casual fan wouldn't get. They
would be fine with it. But like us, we got

576
00:50:41,345 --> 00:50:48,741
a little a little extra boner from that. Just
an extra inch there. The Channing Tatum reveal

577
00:50:49,001 --> 00:50:52,904
was actually probably my favorite moment in
the entire film, because when I saw the card,

578
00:50:53,185 --> 00:50:58,089
I was like, oh, shit, they brought Taylor Kitsch
back. And then sure enough, it's fucking Channing

579
00:50:58,129 --> 00:51:03,873
Tatum. I was like, what? It was amazing. Hands
down, my favorite cameo. I got to say my least

580
00:51:03,933 --> 00:51:09,238
favorite cameo, though, was fucking Henry Cavill
as Wolverine. I did not appreciate that shit.

581
00:51:09,258 --> 00:51:17,167
That was perfect. The Cavalry was so good. They
broke my heart. Well, I think DC and the executives

582
00:51:17,187 --> 00:51:21,348
broke your heart when they fired him. Yeah.
I'm going to insist everyone on the Discord

583
00:51:21,368 --> 00:51:29,931
that's part of Team Marvel now refer to Team
DC as the shit fucks down the street. Yes.

584
00:51:30,811 --> 00:51:35,413
It was such a good moment. I remember people
talking about Henry Cavill being cast as the

585
00:51:35,453 --> 00:51:38,306
new Wolverine in the MCU. I was like, you guys
don't know what you're talking about. That's

586
00:51:38,346 --> 00:51:43,388
just wishful fanboy thinking. But apparently
the rumor got enough traction to actually warrant

587
00:51:43,428 --> 00:51:47,510
a cameo in this movie. And I was, I'm totally
here for it. And he seems like such a nerd

588
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:51,211
guy that he'd be down for that kind of stuff.
Cause you know, you know, he loves all this

589
00:51:51,251 --> 00:51:55,733
kind of nerd stuff. I do have to say that they
did drop the ball on one major cameo that they

590
00:51:56,053 --> 00:52:01,035
could have and totally should have done. And
that was Joe Manganiello as Deathstroke. You

591
00:52:01,055 --> 00:52:05,237
could have played off of that with like, oh,
like I came first, you're a variance of me

592
00:52:05,317 --> 00:52:10,703
kind of thing. Now we only need so many DC cameos
in a Marvel movie, okay? All right, whatever

593
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:16,705
I will tell you one cameo. I was expecting and
highly disappointed I didn't get I didn't get

594
00:52:16,745 --> 00:52:22,167
Taylor Swift as dazzler and I was very disappointed.
I didn't get that I was totally expecting that

595
00:52:22,647 --> 00:52:26,349
I was too actually well I mean like there was
so much buzz around that Taylor Swift being

596
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:31,370
in the movie and she even sent out like an Instagram
post congratulating Ryan Reynolds and Blake

597
00:52:31,390 --> 00:52:35,092
Lively and Hugh Jackman and everybody on their
movie and stuff like that So yeah, I felt very

598
00:52:35,132 --> 00:52:38,833
strange that she wasn't in there. I wasn't actually
expecting her to be in the film per se I was

599
00:52:38,873 --> 00:52:42,915
expecting to see her in like an end credit scene
like and it's just a throwaway thing that didn't

600
00:52:42,935 --> 00:52:48,838
really matter I was not disappointed with the
end credit scene. We got yeah It was exactly

601
00:52:48,878 --> 00:52:54,020
like my high school senior class video that
they put on at the end of the year Oh, yeah,

602
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:58,914
the mid credits, you know with Green Day. It
was the exact same video. Yeah but a perfect

603
00:52:58,974 --> 00:53:03,758
cathartic moment for the end of an era, if you
will. Right. Made me feel sad. Yeah. Well,

604
00:53:03,938 --> 00:53:09,223
like the movie turned out to be a love letter
to the superhero films of the early 2000s and

605
00:53:09,243 --> 00:53:14,187
late 90s. You know, the Fox universe, the New
Line stuff with Blade. So it was like bittersweet

606
00:53:14,207 --> 00:53:19,832
in that way. We're saying goodbye to all that
nostalgia. And now we're in this new consolidated

607
00:53:19,952 --> 00:53:25,997
MCU universe. Sony notwithstanding. Fucking
Sony. The end to end credit scene with Johnny

608
00:53:26,037 --> 00:53:29,634
Storm, though. I don't know if it was quite
worth staying for, but it did make me laugh

609
00:53:29,674 --> 00:53:34,621
my ass off. I love that this was like a Boston
version of a Chinese storm and Chris Evans

610
00:53:34,661 --> 00:53:38,287
brought out like his natural Boston accent.
That was that was good stuff. Yeah, I didn't

611
00:53:38,307 --> 00:53:42,072
need it to set up anything new. I was happy
to just kind of add an extra laugh. That was

612
00:53:42,112 --> 00:53:42,473
right for me.

00:54:37,327 --> 00:54:43,091
Let's go ahead and get into our character breakdown,
starting with Deadpool, aka Wade Wilson, played

621
00:54:43,111 --> 00:54:49,095
by, of course, Ryan Reynolds, who is Marvel
Jesus as far as I'm concerned. He is, I think,

622
00:54:49,235 --> 00:54:53,698
Marvel Studios' biggest A-list talent now that
Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans have left,

623
00:54:53,718 --> 00:54:57,821
although, you know, RDJ is coming back, but
I'm trying not to think about that too much.

624
00:54:57,981 --> 00:55:03,325
Lame. So lame. Super lame. Yeah, this, I mean,
this is the largest R-rated opening weekend

625
00:55:03,365 --> 00:55:07,835
of all time. Yeah, I think it's projected to
make around 205 million. And it's like the

626
00:55:07,955 --> 00:55:11,837
eighth biggest opening worldwide of all time.
It's just it's going to make a billion dollars,

627
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:16,059
which is really good for, you know, people who
are talking about super hero fatigue. Yeah,

628
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:21,401
Ryan Reynolds is a gem. You know, he's just
as in command of the Deadpool role as a like

629
00:55:21,541 --> 00:55:25,903
Robert Downey Jr. was for Iron Man or, you know,
Christopher Reeve for Superman back in the

630
00:55:25,943 --> 00:55:30,345
70s or something like that. He just very much
personifies the role and not even just Deadpool,

631
00:55:30,425 --> 00:55:33,959
even like the other variants that he played
like. Nice Pool and stuff like that. I thought

632
00:55:33,979 --> 00:55:39,362
that was hilarious. I forgot about Nice Pool.
Van Milder. He was like regeneration. What?

633
00:55:41,824 --> 00:55:46,467
The first time through I wasn't all that big
on Nice Pool, but the second time through I

634
00:55:46,487 --> 00:55:49,970
think it worked better for me Sure. I think
one of my biggest laughs in the movie was when

635
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:54,573
Deadpool killed him on purpose. Oh, yeah You
know like early in the movie they had set that

636
00:55:54,613 --> 00:55:58,676
up because he was like, you know You don't want
me as an owner in case anything happens to

637
00:55:58,696 --> 00:56:03,670
you and he's like what could happen to me and
he's like all kinds of things. So you knew

638
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:07,392
it was kind of lurking there in the background.
I think this is the most sinister we've ever

639
00:56:07,432 --> 00:56:12,314
seen Deadpool was in this movie. Like when he
got Johnny Storm killed and then he got nice

640
00:56:12,354 --> 00:56:15,635
pull killed. It's kind of funny, especially
the part where he's like, you're going to live.

641
00:56:15,655 --> 00:56:21,318
God damn it. Shout it. And he's like, I was
laughing my ass off at that point. The thing

642
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:27,720
that made me laugh the most and it happens very
quickly after Wolverine walks past the Deadpool

643
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:32,591
core with the dog and they're not shooting him.
When they cut back, they He's performing CPR

644
00:56:32,611 --> 00:56:38,216
in a headless body. It only happens for a few
seconds. But I was giggling for so long to

645
00:56:38,236 --> 00:56:42,900
the point where my son was like, what is so
funny? And I was like, I'll tell you later.

646
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:46,944
And then following that up with him brandishing
the gold plated guns, that was just so good.

647
00:56:47,744 --> 00:56:51,148
Again, which was set up earlier, you knew he
was gonna end up with those. Right. My favorite

648
00:56:51,168 --> 00:56:54,731
part with NicePool was so when he looked at
the camera, it was like, the proposal. And

649
00:56:54,791 --> 00:57:01,436
Deadpool was like, is that what you think I
do? So Deadpool's arc here, I think, was about

650
00:57:01,476 --> 00:57:06,121
coming out of depression. He got rejected from
the Avengers, which was just the final straw

651
00:57:06,141 --> 00:57:11,285
for him in that moment that put him into a downward
spiral, leading to his retirement. It cost

652
00:57:11,325 --> 00:57:16,250
him his relationship with Vanessa, but he comes
out of his funk, getting abducted by the TVA,

653
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:21,454
finding new purpose. He saves his friends and
his timeline from destruction in the process,

654
00:57:21,514 --> 00:57:26,579
bonding with a larger team of heroes like Wolverine
and the Resistance. culminating in his attempt

655
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:32,203
to sacrifice himself for those he loves. But
here's the thing, in Deadpool 2, he saved Cable's

656
00:57:32,223 --> 00:57:36,606
timeline from Firefist in the process bonding
with a larger team of heroes, Cable and X-Force,

657
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:41,109
which culminated in his self-sacrifice. Like
he died in that movie and Cable brought him

658
00:57:41,149 --> 00:57:46,813
back. So the character growth that he went through
in Deadpool and Wolverine was pretty damn similar

659
00:57:46,853 --> 00:57:51,797
to the character growth he already had in Deadpool
2. Like if you substitute Wade's sadness over

660
00:57:51,837 --> 00:57:56,716
Vanessa's death, with Wade's depression over
his lack of meaning, you have almost nearly

661
00:57:56,796 --> 00:58:04,059
identical arcs. I don't disagree. I found it's
more about sacrifice for others, not sacrifice

662
00:58:04,099 --> 00:58:10,003
for himself. I felt like this one was a little
bit more about him himself, finding his personal

663
00:58:10,043 --> 00:58:15,265
growth. They had that specific moment where
Happy talks about the Avengers, like, you know,

664
00:58:15,285 --> 00:58:20,468
they're Avengers because people need them. And
at the end, when he is doing the time-ripper

665
00:58:20,508 --> 00:58:25,407
thing, he says, I'm doing it for others, finally.
It's his growth for trying to put others above

666
00:58:25,447 --> 00:58:33,191
him. I think that's valid fucking. I don't care.
We're still good I noticed that as I was watching

667
00:58:33,211 --> 00:58:38,074
that thought that was really similar to the
second film You just kind of replace the foil

668
00:58:38,094 --> 00:58:43,937
that was cable with the foil that is Wolverine
though I have to say I think Deadpool and Wolverine

669
00:58:43,957 --> 00:58:49,100
played off each other a lot better than Deadpool
and cable So even if it was the same one we

670
00:58:49,120 --> 00:58:54,262
can agree they did it better in this movie.
Yes, absolutely Absolutely. Can I add to that

671
00:58:54,302 --> 00:59:01,046
real quick, though? Sure. That's Deadpool. Deadpool
constantly wants to be the hero and then gets

672
00:59:01,086 --> 00:59:04,668
in his own way. And he tries to be the hero,
then gets in his own way. Wants to be a part

673
00:59:04,688 --> 00:59:10,951
of team, gets in his own way. That's his whole
fucking arc over and over and over again. So

674
00:59:10,971 --> 00:59:15,734
it doesn't bother me that it's the same thing
we're getting, but it's done better. Well,

675
00:59:15,754 --> 00:59:19,276
Deadpool is a type of character that you don't
necessarily need to take seriously in that

676
00:59:19,316 --> 00:59:24,262
way. So in some regards, he's above this type
of criticism. And that could either be to the

677
00:59:24,282 --> 00:59:28,743
character's detriment or you guys are big Deadpool
fans, there's a reason that he's such a popular

678
00:59:28,763 --> 00:59:32,884
character is because he's so charismatic and
endearing no matter what he goes through. And

679
00:59:32,924 --> 00:59:36,405
you don't want him to change that much. Right.
You kind of want him to keep getting in his

680
00:59:36,485 --> 00:59:42,827
own way. Yeah, valid, valid. But to get to Hugh
Jackman and Wolverine, I totally see him as

681
00:59:42,847 --> 00:59:47,869
the heart of this film. He actually had a fantastic
character arc because he is also battling depression

682
00:59:47,909 --> 00:59:53,715
here, which manifested with alcoholism and self-loathing.
His aim was to seek redemption for his past

683
00:59:53,775 --> 00:59:58,757
when he abandoned his X-Men team who died. And
though he wasn't able to fix what happened

684
00:59:58,798 --> 01:00:03,280
in his timeline, he was able to help save Wade's
and it was enough to help him get through his

685
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:08,223
depression and find a new life in that timeline
with his new surrogate daughter, X-23. I was

686
01:00:08,263 --> 01:00:12,345
really glad that they brought her back into
Wade's timeline as well, because then he could

687
01:00:12,365 --> 01:00:17,127
kind of go through the same arc that Logan did
in the movie. Logan. Yeah. The arc for Wolverine

688
01:00:17,167 --> 01:00:21,486
is really the one that matters here as we've,
as I've kind of already set up Deadpool. doesn't

689
01:00:21,526 --> 01:00:26,110
do these arcs all that well, you know, he just
kind of is going to revert to his, oh, I'm

690
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:31,836
the funny mouth and I kill people and all that
kind of stuff. Like say for the end of Deadpool

691
01:00:31,936 --> 01:00:36,701
one, where he kills Ajax at the end, even though
Colossus is giving him that speech of, you

692
01:00:36,721 --> 01:00:40,365
know, we don't kill them for five moments and
then he shoots Ajax in the head in this movie.

693
01:00:40,385 --> 01:00:44,609
It parallels that, you know, but Wolverine is
the one who says, no, we're not going to kill

694
01:00:44,649 --> 01:00:48,672
Cassandra Nova. He's the real hero. He is the
one who goes through this arc. And because

695
01:00:48,772 --> 01:00:54,035
he is the important one, he is the hero guy.
He is that hero type and he is the anchor being.

696
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:57,337
I think it totally makes sense why he is the
one who goes through more of the character

697
01:00:57,357 --> 01:01:03,521
arc than Deadpool. Yeah, absolutely. I do have
to say, though, that I thought the reason for

698
01:01:03,821 --> 01:01:09,665
why he was so depressed and how he failed everybody
was going to be much more interesting. And

699
01:01:09,725 --> 01:01:15,052
I was at first initially. disappointed that
was basically, oh, he went to a bar and while

700
01:01:15,072 --> 01:01:19,095
he was away, everyone died. I thought it was
going to be something more like in Logan where,

701
01:01:19,215 --> 01:01:23,658
you know, Professor X started to get seizures
and those seizures kind of killed everyone.

702
01:01:24,078 --> 01:01:29,082
So for it to be something so simple, again,
initially I found kind of disappointing, but

703
01:01:29,482 --> 01:01:34,946
later on I kind of appreciated how simple it
was, I guess, because that really wasn't what

704
01:01:34,986 --> 01:01:40,514
the story was about. All he needed to do was
kind of feel that survivor's guilt, which Logan

705
01:01:40,574 --> 01:01:45,197
is bound to do because he has such a high longevity.
He was going to outlive everyone anyway, and

706
01:01:45,217 --> 01:01:49,860
they could have gone with that even. But that
ultimately wasn't as important to a story arc

707
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:54,283
as the fact that he did grow. We don't need
to make things more convoluted than they are.

708
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:58,025
I thought it was pretty well done. Well, it
wasn't just that he got drunk and kind of ran

709
01:01:58,065 --> 01:02:03,349
away. He talked about how he basically went
to a berserker rage and he killed fucking everybody.

710
01:02:03,689 --> 01:02:09,274
And then. All humans turned on mutants afterwards
because of that. That's true. So he started

711
01:02:09,314 --> 01:02:14,338
that because of his rage. He was the downfall
of all mutants. And to add on to what Adam

712
01:02:14,378 --> 01:02:19,763
said, the first time he tells you what happens,
he says he was away when they revisit it. At

713
01:02:19,803 --> 01:02:26,429
the end, he actually says, it wasn't just that
I was away. I walked away. I heard them basically

714
01:02:26,469 --> 01:02:32,442
being killed and I walked away. Then when I
saw the bodies, I went into my rage. So. It

715
01:02:32,462 --> 01:02:37,364
was not just that he happened to be away. It
was his active choice to walk away from it.

716
01:02:37,524 --> 01:02:42,466
Yeah. And then his guilt with that. And that's
why he was wearing the suit. The pajamas, as

717
01:02:42,486 --> 01:02:47,328
Deadpool called them, because he felt guilty
about rejecting that earlier. What did you

718
01:02:47,368 --> 01:02:52,190
guys think of the suit? God damn, that suit
looks good. Yeah, I loved the suit. I have

719
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:57,312
thoughts on the cowl. Yeah. I mean, the cowl,
you when I saw it, I was like, oh, I mean,

720
01:02:57,352 --> 01:03:03,168
of course, you know, extra another extra inch.
just came on me. But after a while you kind

721
01:03:03,208 --> 01:03:09,293
of realize, okay, that's why they didn't do
this. Right. It's the eyes. Also, it's hard

722
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:14,958
to make that mask a perfect size because I feel
like the wings needed to be slightly bigger

723
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:20,323
to make them look more comic accurate, but at
the same time, they would look ridiculous.

724
01:03:20,543 --> 01:03:25,547
The blow job handles? Yes, if they were actually
that big. So it was a hard thing to do in live

725
01:03:25,607 --> 01:03:30,863
action. I think they did the absolute best they
could. They stuck to the white eyes because

726
01:03:30,883 --> 01:03:36,526
they're already doing it with Deadpool. Although
I feel like they didn't make them as expressive

727
01:03:36,686 --> 01:03:40,848
as Deadpool's are because I know that the way
they do that is he actually takes the eyepieces

728
01:03:41,028 --> 01:03:46,171
out when they're filming and they track his
eyebrow movements so that Deadpool's eyes are

729
01:03:46,191 --> 01:03:50,693
expressive. I don't feel like they did that
with Wolverines and I wish they had. Yeah,

730
01:03:50,753 --> 01:03:55,976
I think the issue was his eye line was always
off. It was like he was blind when he should

731
01:03:55,996 --> 01:04:02,460
have been looking at Wade. you have that kind
of line that really shows you where his head

732
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:09,985
is pointing. And it's kind of an issue in live
action. Kind of like Batman. Yeah. I thought

733
01:04:10,045 --> 01:04:14,868
his Wolverine suit was great. It did look a
little football patty at times. I actually

734
01:04:14,888 --> 01:04:19,532
think I slightly preferred the brown and yellow,
the mustard and brown one that they use for

735
01:04:19,552 --> 01:04:23,474
that short little moment for the Hulk thing.
I was like, that looks a little bit more simpler.

736
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:28,177
I think I liked it just a slightly bit better,
but still super exciting to see him in a more

737
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:32,813
Accurate costume for sure. That was great I
kind of feel like the whole reason they did

738
01:04:32,853 --> 01:04:37,197
the Deadpool core scene at the end and I could
be wrong Was just so that they could show the

739
01:04:37,217 --> 01:04:41,420
mask I kind of like that whole scene didn't
really need to be in the movie I think that's

740
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:44,683
when the movie started to feel long for me.
I don't really care about the Deadpool core

741
01:04:44,703 --> 01:04:49,787
personally Well, that's because you're wrong
I think if they just put the mask on earlier

742
01:04:49,867 --> 01:04:53,711
when they were going up against Cassandra Nova's
team I think that would have been perfectly

743
01:04:53,731 --> 01:04:57,698
fine. I would have been happy with that. It
all kind of felt a little bit extra I can see

744
01:04:57,718 --> 01:05:01,579
where you're coming from because the Deadpool
core was shoehorned in they could have immediately

745
01:05:01,639 --> 01:05:05,460
just gone to destroy the time Ripper because
they already had really their third act fight

746
01:05:05,861 --> 01:05:10,903
back in the void But here's the thing how can
you have a multiversal Deadpool movie and not

747
01:05:10,943 --> 01:05:14,904
have the Deadpool core you have to I was just
gonna Say they had to have them because this

748
01:05:14,924 --> 01:05:18,225
is the only place you can do it anywhere else
It doesn't make any sense. Yeah secret oars

749
01:05:19,242 --> 01:05:23,343
Well, because that would take over too much.
Yeah, there's going to be too much in too much

750
01:05:23,523 --> 01:05:28,184
Deadpool. But I mean, they tied it in well enough.
They set it up, you know, multiple times. We

751
01:05:28,284 --> 01:05:32,145
you know, we when we first met Nice Pool, he
kind of alluded to it. And then Cassandra Nova

752
01:05:32,165 --> 01:05:35,666
said Deadpool's are a diamond dozen here, but
we do, you know, this is like our first Wolverine.

753
01:05:35,906 --> 01:05:40,768
So we got little glimpses. And then when they
came out for the Deadpool nerds like us, I

754
01:05:40,788 --> 01:05:45,289
was in there looking at like, oh my God, which
ones do I recognize? Which ones have I seen

755
01:05:45,329 --> 01:05:49,007
in the comics? There's only one I'm gonna mention
that disappointed me that wasn't in there because

756
01:05:49,107 --> 01:05:53,490
I imagine John was as well If he thought of
it is agent X was I would have loved to see

757
01:05:53,530 --> 01:05:57,713
him It's somewhere in the background as well,
but that's it. I see I don't see him as a Deadpool

758
01:05:57,733 --> 01:06:03,736
variant I know he is but I kind of see him.
I see him as his own thing. Sure. So fair Let's

759
01:06:03,756 --> 01:06:08,519
go ahead and move on to the villains of the
piece. I Think the Deadpool films their main

760
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:14,207
weakness has always been the villains sure especially
Deadpool 2 I didn't love either Cassandra Nova

761
01:06:14,347 --> 01:06:18,950
or Mr. Paradox. Dude, I loved Cassandra Nova.
What are you talking about? I'm with Jonathan.

762
01:06:19,411 --> 01:06:23,834
Cassandra Nova I really liked. I guess I've
never really been a fan of Cassandra Nova from

763
01:06:23,894 --> 01:06:28,717
the comics. Now she was a Grant Morrison creation.
She's the twin of professor Charles Xavier.

764
01:06:29,198 --> 01:06:34,221
In the comics, I always saw her as more bitter
and nasty and stuff like that. But here she

765
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:39,385
was like deceptively sweet. And I guess that
kind of threw off my preconceived notions of

766
01:06:39,405 --> 01:06:43,631
what the character. should and would be like
in the movie. I don't know, it sounded like

767
01:06:43,891 --> 01:06:47,974
maybe she was still a little bitter, but I mean,
it's not gonna be the exact same thing. I mean,

768
01:06:47,994 --> 01:06:54,117
she was evil. I will say, that shit sounds like
something Grant Morrison would do, so I totally

769
01:06:54,157 --> 01:06:58,720
understand that. I'm actually with them, I actually
really liked her. I liked her better even the

770
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:02,121
second time than the first time, because there's
a lot of things that I noticed about her the

771
01:07:02,202 --> 01:07:07,484
second time. Some of the mannerisms in her facial
expressions were really good. The fact that

772
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:12,935
they actually elongated her fingers. which made
her seem more creepy. She was fairly creepy.

773
01:07:12,955 --> 01:07:17,477
I thought the actress did a good job. Yes, I
agree. And I'll be honest, I'm kind of glad

774
01:07:17,537 --> 01:07:22,199
we didn't get like an all out fight at the end
with her, because by the time we got to that,

775
01:07:22,219 --> 01:07:26,160
I was already fought out. Also, realistically,
they weren't gonna win a fight with her. They

776
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:31,002
had to do something out of the ordinary in order
to, well, say finish her off sounds weird.

777
01:07:31,022 --> 01:07:37,105
But, I'd finish her off. It's a Deadpool review,
you're fine. Especially when she talked about

778
01:07:37,945 --> 01:07:43,239
flicking her bean. Yeah, to end you- oh man.
Yeah, I was happy there. Now I got a new box

779
01:07:43,259 --> 01:07:47,661
set, I gotta go find- Yeah, I'm gonna listen
to White Flag tonight. There's a box set? White

780
01:07:47,681 --> 01:07:51,883
Flag is Dido, isn't it? Oh yeah, you're right,
that's Dido, my bad. I always confuse him.

781
01:07:51,903 --> 01:07:57,545
Come on, man. It's the same person. Fine. I
thought the way they portrayed Kassandra Nova's

782
01:07:57,585 --> 01:08:01,807
powers was really fascinating here because,
you know, she has all the powers of Professor

783
01:08:02,007 --> 01:08:09,202
X in addition to his potential latent powers
according to his DNA. So- She has telekinesis.

784
01:08:09,282 --> 01:08:14,824
She has the ability to phase. And I thought
the way that they combined those aspects here

785
01:08:15,064 --> 01:08:20,606
by giving her more tactile telepathy and she
has to like phase into their minds in order

786
01:08:20,646 --> 01:08:25,347
to read their minds. That was creepy as hell.
Oh, yeah. It was incredible. Very cinematic.

787
01:08:25,567 --> 01:08:31,209
Great decision to do that. Absolutely horrifying.
It's just a new great way to visualize telepathy

788
01:08:31,269 --> 01:08:34,882
without. doing the same old boring thing of,
you know, two people standing across from each

789
01:08:34,922 --> 01:08:37,983
other. One of them raises their fingers to their
forehead and then, you know, they read their

790
01:08:38,023 --> 01:08:42,585
thoughts. I guess to move over to Paradox, the
other villain, I actually really like the actor.

791
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:47,146
I thought he was wonderful. I liked, you know,
the very Britishness about him. And he's the

792
01:08:47,506 --> 01:08:52,568
white collar villain in this one. I do think
he had some motivational issues. I thought

793
01:08:52,588 --> 01:08:57,329
it was kind of strange that they're going off
grid and they're going to build this time ripper

794
01:08:57,429 --> 01:09:02,791
and prune stuff themselves. But yet he also
decided to pull Deadpool out because his bosses

795
01:09:02,831 --> 01:09:05,971
told him to. Like, why are you listening to
your bosses on this when you're just gonna

796
01:09:05,991 --> 01:09:10,173
like turn around and not listen to them for
other stuff? Right. I will say this, the one

797
01:09:10,193 --> 01:09:14,454
thing they say is that basically that timeline
was going to get pruned, it was just gonna

798
01:09:14,474 --> 01:09:20,535
take 2,000 years for it to happen. But I just
think he just wasn't patient. Also, my first

799
01:09:20,595 --> 01:09:26,677
thought was why would he have so many of these
people with him? Because he had like a whole

800
01:09:26,757 --> 01:09:32,403
section of people. However... If we're taking
this to kind of happen not long after Loki

801
01:09:32,443 --> 01:09:38,145
season two, their decision to change the way
they do things is a very stark change in a

802
01:09:38,185 --> 01:09:44,148
very fast time. And I could see that being iffy
for people who are used to doing the same thing

803
01:09:44,188 --> 01:09:49,870
for probably thousands of years at that point
and not wanting to change and say, oh, this

804
01:09:49,890 --> 01:09:53,391
guy wants to go back to the way we did do it.
I'm more comfortable there. Let's go with him.

805
01:09:54,252 --> 01:10:00,566
It's not a good motivation though. It's my biggest
issue with the film. was to destroy Wade's

806
01:10:00,606 --> 01:10:04,628
timeline because it was more efficient to do
so and it would impress him to his higher-ups

807
01:10:04,648 --> 01:10:09,910
so that he would become leader of the TVA. But
since Loki took over the timelines and they're

808
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:15,233
allowing these branches to grow and a multiverse
to exist, the TVA's function is no longer to

809
01:10:15,273 --> 01:10:19,534
prune timelines. You're assuming that he knows
about Loki. Even if he doesn't, his directive

810
01:10:19,554 --> 01:10:25,617
would be to let the multiverse thrive. TVA has
reset charges that they used to use to prune

811
01:10:25,657 --> 01:10:30,544
timelines all the time. I don't understand why
he had to use this time ripper device. It was

812
01:10:30,745 --> 01:10:35,869
very strange and definitely not in accordance
with a lot of what we saw in the Loki television

813
01:10:35,909 --> 01:10:40,653
series. Also considering that, you know, they're
in the TVA, time doesn't exist, there was no

814
01:10:40,733 --> 01:10:47,358
reason why they were like, oh, we have to rush
this 2000 year thing. Exactly. That doesn't

815
01:10:47,378 --> 01:10:51,802
make sense. And it was clear that even if he
did prune this timeline with the time ripper,

816
01:10:52,242 --> 01:10:55,745
he's not going to impress anybody with it. They
would have actually admonished him and they

817
01:10:55,865 --> 01:11:01,933
did. for what he tried to do. So it just made
no sense and because his whole motivation doesn't

818
01:11:01,953 --> 01:11:07,296
make sense, the story almost falls apart because
of that. Also I have an issue with anchor beings.

819
01:11:07,556 --> 01:11:12,779
The idea of anchor beings, it makes me wonder
how any timeline branch survives more than

820
01:11:12,899 --> 01:11:17,941
a couple thousand years because humans only
have so long of a lifespan. The idea of anchor

821
01:11:17,961 --> 01:11:22,904
beings means that eventually any timeline branch
is going to die and that the multiverse is

822
01:11:22,944 --> 01:11:29,549
then essentially self-containing. and the TVA
beforehand would seem irrelevant prior to Loki

823
01:11:29,669 --> 01:11:34,513
taking on his throne. I don't know, that's reading
a lot into it, I think. The issue of anchor

824
01:11:34,553 --> 01:11:39,878
beings didn't really bother me. I actually liked
the idea that they exist and that Wolverine

825
01:11:39,918 --> 01:11:45,242
would be one of them. I'm sure there is some
kind of, you know, paradoxical nature to it,

826
01:11:45,643 --> 01:11:52,328
but then it bothered me so much as we never
learned who Paradox was like answering to or

827
01:11:52,348 --> 01:11:56,151
working for, because it seemed like... He really
wasn't answering to the TVA. He was answering

828
01:11:56,192 --> 01:12:01,496
to some kind of like shadow organization, perhaps
within it or even outside of it. And we never

829
01:12:01,536 --> 01:12:05,619
got that closure. Well, he was working for himself.
He was selfish. He wanted to be in charge of

830
01:12:05,639 --> 01:12:09,823
the TVA. It was all bullshit. So then why pull
out Deadpool? Why pull out Deadpool at all?

831
01:12:10,203 --> 01:12:14,406
Because his higher ups wanted Deadpool to be
part of the Sacred Timeline because it's part

832
01:12:14,426 --> 01:12:17,929
of his destiny. He has some kind of big role
to play in the Sacred Timeline's future. Oh,

833
01:12:17,949 --> 01:12:22,813
yeah. He has to die in Thor's arms. Yeah, exactly.
So he could die. The motivational problems

834
01:12:22,853 --> 01:12:27,215
were there. But at the same time, it didn't
anger me like it seems to have angered you,

835
01:12:27,395 --> 01:12:31,337
Joseph, because at the end of it, it's a fucking
Deadpool movie, and I was able to kind of cut

836
01:12:31,357 --> 01:12:35,538
that cord from my head and be like, alright,
fine, fuck it. Also, I'm gonna say this is

837
01:12:35,558 --> 01:12:38,820
why I think you're wrong. First of all, you're
assuming that all the anchor beings are happening

838
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:43,782
now. Instead of maybe one timeline, anchor being
doesn't happen for another 5000 years. In which

839
01:12:43,822 --> 01:12:48,264
case, that timeline doesn't get trimmed. Also,
everything up until this point, up until Loki,

840
01:12:48,604 --> 01:12:52,665
was one timeline, yes? Correct. Yeah, it was
the secret timeline. Everything else was being

841
01:12:52,765 --> 01:12:58,708
pruned. So in this case, anchor beings is probably
a new thing because they have all these different

842
01:12:58,728 --> 01:13:02,950
timelines. Some people say like if it doesn't
happen on screen, it shouldn't happen, but

843
01:13:03,170 --> 01:13:06,791
to me, I don't need to hear about them discovering
anchor beings. They just say, hey, we discovered

844
01:13:06,811 --> 01:13:11,373
it. Each of these timelines has an anchor being.
So all of these little variant timelines are

845
01:13:11,413 --> 01:13:15,175
not all going to be the same length. I think
it just brings it back to even if that were

846
01:13:15,215 --> 01:13:20,257
the case, the TVA never needed to exist because
the multiverse was self-sustaining in that

847
01:13:20,337 --> 01:13:25,764
sense errant timelines would eventually die.
But Kang started the pruning because he didn't

848
01:13:25,784 --> 01:13:29,908
want the multiverse wars. And so even with like
over these thousands of years, that war still

849
01:13:29,928 --> 01:13:35,272
might have happened. And so it got pruned because
he, you know, knew that the even the sacred

850
01:13:35,292 --> 01:13:39,695
timeline would get exploded. And so that was
kind of why he started the prune stuff and

851
01:13:39,715 --> 01:13:44,519
the TVA. So, I mean, yes, it could be self-sustaining,
but it wasn't about it being self-sustaining.

852
01:13:44,599 --> 01:13:49,845
It was about Kang stopping the war. The other
Kang's. Yeah. And now that is the TVA's new

853
01:13:49,885 --> 01:13:56,499
primary function, is stopping the multiversal
war. It's all convoluted. Super! As John says.

854
01:13:57,281 --> 01:13:59,145
So convoluted. Multiverses suck.

855
01:14:06,414 --> 01:14:10,315
I think that does it for the character breakdown,
so let's go ahead and get into our story highlights.

856
01:14:10,916 --> 01:14:15,698
Deadpool visits Logan's grave where he's attacked
by a group of time variance authority hunters.

857
01:14:16,178 --> 01:14:20,700
In a flashback to when Deadpool used Cable's
time travel device, he ends up on the Sacred

858
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:26,042
Timeline in 2018, where he tries to join the
Avengers in an interview with Happy Hogan,

859
01:14:26,262 --> 01:14:31,505
but is rejected. I thought it was really interesting
that typically the Deadpool films don't take

860
01:14:31,545 --> 01:14:36,360
the credit scenes seriously. And like this one
didn't, but like it actually had actual credits

861
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:40,824
for the people that were involved in the production.
And I kind of missed those gags. But it was

862
01:14:40,864 --> 01:14:46,288
really funny to see Deadpool dancing to N-Sync.
Oh, yeah. I mean, it was a ton of fun. They

863
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:50,992
set up what you're getting. You're getting a
lot of dumb fun. And I agree, like as the first

864
01:14:51,012 --> 01:14:55,195
two movies, they had like the fake title cards.
And this one, they use extra real ones. But

865
01:14:55,315 --> 01:14:59,939
I do specifically want to mention because of
that scene, all of us were worried about how

866
01:14:59,979 --> 01:15:06,227
the fuck are we going to respectfully bring
and deal with Logan and then we don't. And

867
01:15:06,247 --> 01:15:11,070
that's so perfectly fucking done that way. And
only a way a Deadpool could do it is, yeah,

868
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:15,693
we're not going to be respectful. We're going
to literally play with his fucking bones, desecrate

869
01:15:15,733 --> 01:15:21,617
his body. And we'd love it. And I love every
second of that. It was so good. I was horrified.

870
01:15:22,037 --> 01:15:27,640
I never understood the confusion because it
always said that Logan takes place in the future,

871
01:15:27,741 --> 01:15:32,876
like 2029 or some shit. There is nothing to
say that Deadpool and Wolverine had to take

872
01:15:32,896 --> 01:15:38,221
place after that. So I was never confused about
how they were going to include him in the story

873
01:15:38,781 --> 01:15:44,867
because it's fucking time. Logan was set in
the future. Jesus H Christ people, it is not

874
01:15:45,247 --> 01:15:51,092
that difficult. I have the same issue with people
who couldn't figure out why in Endgame affecting

875
01:15:51,132 --> 01:15:54,776
the past does not affect the future. And I've
talked to so many people who are like, I just

876
01:15:54,836 --> 01:16:00,103
understand. It is not fucking hard. It's not
hard to understand that when you move to the

877
01:16:00,143 --> 01:16:05,687
past that past is not your past It is now your
future and it is a completely different Timeline

878
01:16:05,747 --> 01:16:09,670
essentially in this case, but it's funny cuz
Deadpool 2 they use the dead they use back

879
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:15,534
to the future style because the bear that cable
was carrying was burned and then when he Sacrificed

880
01:16:15,554 --> 01:16:20,237
himself at the end the bear turned to bright
and it's showing that his kid didn't die. So

881
01:16:20,257 --> 01:16:23,932
they Fucking, well granted at that time, there
wasn't part of the MCU, but it's- I mean, you

882
01:16:23,952 --> 01:16:28,256
could also say that it was not cyclical. He
went back and changed it, and what he went

883
01:16:28,296 --> 01:16:32,239
forward to was a completely new timeline. And
look at Days of Future Past as well, you know,

884
01:16:32,259 --> 01:16:36,943
the way they handled time there. I guess time
works differently depending on which branch

885
01:16:36,983 --> 01:16:41,807
of the Marvel multiverse you're in. Yeah, I
was one of the people who was not thrilled

886
01:16:42,087 --> 01:16:47,772
when I found out that Hugh Jackman was returning
to the role of Logan, not because I was wondering

887
01:16:48,052 --> 01:16:53,039
how they were going to do it story-wise. but
because we already had that cathartic goodbye

888
01:16:53,059 --> 01:16:57,441
for the character. But I will admit that I am
happy that he decided to make the return back

889
01:16:57,501 --> 01:17:03,184
and that they brought him back in such a fantastic
way. I liked the heartfelt scene of when Deadpool

890
01:17:03,204 --> 01:17:06,445
was trying to join the Avengers because he really
felt like he wanted it. And I thought that

891
01:17:06,466 --> 01:17:10,167
was a great bit of acting. That confused me.
That really confused me. Okay. So I get he

892
01:17:10,207 --> 01:17:15,442
breaks the fourth wall, right? And so he would
know about the Avengers. But the fact that

893
01:17:15,562 --> 01:17:22,568
they established him as being on Earth 1005,
whatever it was. So he traveled through the

894
01:17:22,608 --> 01:17:28,653
multiverse to Earth 616. He's wearing a cable's
thing. So that's how he moved across. But so

895
01:17:28,693 --> 01:17:33,717
he was willing to leave his friends and everything
that he had saved to be a part of the Avengers.

896
01:17:34,237 --> 01:17:39,302
And yet when he was offered that opportunity
later on, that's when he got upset. Six years

897
01:17:39,342 --> 01:17:45,602
changes a man. OK, that's a great question.
I didn't think of that. I guess my assumption

898
01:17:45,622 --> 01:17:49,365
is that he probably would have wanted to bring
his friends and family over to the Sacred Timeline

899
01:17:49,425 --> 01:17:55,449
with him if he got the job. I don't know. In
2024, in his native timeline, Wade works as

900
01:17:55,489 --> 01:17:59,512
a used car salesman with his friend Peter, who
throws Wade a surprise birthday party with

901
01:17:59,532 --> 01:18:04,255
all their friends, including his ex-girlfriend
Vanessa. A group of TVA hunters show up and

902
01:18:04,295 --> 01:18:08,838
take Wade to meet Mr. Paradox, an agent who
offers him a place on the Sacred Timeline.

903
01:18:09,279 --> 01:18:13,261
Paradox informs Wade that due to the death of
Logan, who was his timeline's anchor being,

904
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:18,251
his universe is slowly dying. He goes on to
tell Wade that he intends to speed up the process

905
01:18:18,691 --> 01:18:23,953
using a time ripper device to prune Wade's universe
in order to improve the TVA's efficiency so

906
01:18:23,973 --> 01:18:28,895
he can get promoted to the head of the organization.
Unwilling to see his friends die, Wade steals

907
01:18:28,915 --> 01:18:34,317
the TVA Tempad to visit Logan's grave. I love
this scene when the TVA hunters show up at

908
01:18:34,337 --> 01:18:38,955
the party and he's like, this isn't like Pretty
Women. We're going to be kissing. Oh, yeah.

909
01:18:40,036 --> 01:18:43,940
This is the one where he talked about pegging
is not new for me, but new for Disney. Right.

910
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:47,282
That's the and then the wink to the camera.
I mean, that's perfect. Absolutely perfect.

911
01:18:47,543 --> 01:18:52,146
Hilarious. Deadpool travels the multiverse looking
for a Wolverine variant substitute to save

912
01:18:52,187 --> 01:18:57,991
his timeline. He visits short Wolverine, Brown
Suit Wolverine, Age of Apocalypse Wolverine

913
01:18:58,332 --> 01:19:05,023
Patch Crucifixion Wolverine. Old Man Logan and
Cavalryne before coming upon an alcoholic Wolverine

914
01:19:05,063 --> 01:19:10,184
whom he brings back to the TVA. Mr. Paradox
calls this variant the worst Wolverine who

915
01:19:10,224 --> 01:19:14,866
abandoned his X-Men during their tragic deaths.
He then uses a time stick to send Deadpool

916
01:19:14,886 --> 01:19:18,927
and Wolverine to the void at the end of time.
And just wanted to reiterate, Cavalryne is

917
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:22,908
awesome. He's a better Wolverine than he ever
was a Superman.

918
01:19:26,329 --> 01:19:31,863
The crucifixion Wolverine. was dark as hell.
I mean, that's like a classic iconic cover

919
01:19:31,903 --> 01:19:35,444
from the comics. I remember the cover. When
the X-Men went up against the Reavers. But

920
01:19:35,484 --> 01:19:39,186
like seeing it in real life, I was like, holy
shit, you don't want to be that Wolverine for

921
01:19:39,246 --> 01:19:43,908
sure. It also made me realize that I don't want
them to actually cast a five foot three actor

922
01:19:43,928 --> 01:19:50,951
to play the character. No. Seeing short Wolverine.
That's hilarious. I was cracking up the whole

923
01:19:50,991 --> 01:19:55,413
time just because of that. And then I stopped
laughing when I saw Cavalereen. Sucker.

924
01:20:00,019 --> 01:20:04,622
In the Void, Deadpool and Wolverine fight before
Deadpool promises that if they escape the Void

925
01:20:04,642 --> 01:20:09,145
they can not only save his timeline, but also
have the TVA save the X-Men from Wolverine's

926
01:20:09,165 --> 01:20:13,489
timeline. They're discovered by a Human Torch
variant who tells Deadpool and Wolverine about

927
01:20:13,549 --> 01:20:18,292
Cassandra Nova, Professor X's twin sister who
rules over the Void, and about the resistance

928
01:20:18,332 --> 01:20:22,795
force in the Borderlands formed against her.
The three are attacked by Cassandra Nova's

929
01:20:22,855 --> 01:20:27,674
gang who brings them before her. And I do think-
You know, obviously we mentioned already the

930
01:20:27,774 --> 01:20:32,455
importance of the cameos, getting some of these
moments. But fan service was that was this

931
01:20:32,495 --> 01:20:37,176
movie. And we're getting things like, you know,
Wolverine and Deadpool fighting. We're getting

932
01:20:37,337 --> 01:20:41,498
Wolverine and Sabretooth going up against each
other. And it didn't bother me. I know a lot

933
01:20:41,518 --> 01:20:45,759
of people might have wanted like an actual bigger
battle with them. Now we got a lot of other

934
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:49,480
battles down the line, so I didn't care. You
know, he just kind of sliced his head off pretty

935
01:20:49,520 --> 01:20:56,498
quickly. And, you know, in the comics, he beheaded
him. And that's how Sabretooth died. It didn't

936
01:20:56,518 --> 01:21:01,699
bother me one bit, but, you know, I enjoyed
seeing all those characters come in kind of

937
01:21:01,779 --> 01:21:05,340
one by one and be like, oh, shit, there's pyro.
Oh, shit. There's this person. There's that

938
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:10,122
bro. Tyler mains back. Those were wonderful
moments. I mean, John and I have talked about

939
01:21:10,162 --> 01:21:16,363
nostalgia ad nauseam. I love nostalgia. I live
on nostalgia. I mean, I can just feed off of

940
01:21:16,423 --> 01:21:21,645
it and I sustain myself. You had a whole podcast
about it. Exactly. And so it makes me happy.

941
01:21:22,225 --> 01:21:27,272
I have to say next to a cavalry. Tyler Maine
as Sabretooth was the cameo that I was most

942
01:21:27,352 --> 01:21:31,395
disappointed in because I expected a bigger
match between the two. I would have taken a

943
01:21:31,515 --> 01:21:36,119
bigger match between those two and maybe skipped
the whole brawl and the Honda Odyssey fight.

944
01:21:36,239 --> 01:21:39,762
Oh, you're fucking wrong. The Odyssey was amazing.
What? That was so good. That was such a good

945
01:21:39,782 --> 01:21:44,266
fight. The Honda Odyssey fucks, man. Yeah, the
Honda Odyssey fucks. I don't know. So good.

946
01:21:48,029 --> 01:21:52,532
The first fight between Wolverine and Deadpool
where you see Wolverine running on all fours

947
01:21:52,572 --> 01:21:57,354
and stuff, very animalistic. Holy shit. Love
it. Oh, that was so good. See, there were too

948
01:21:57,374 --> 01:22:01,556
many fights between the two and it just felt
redundant to me because no, they're not hurting

949
01:22:01,576 --> 01:22:05,677
each other anyway. They have fucking healing
factor. So why do I need to see this five fucking

950
01:22:05,717 --> 01:22:09,958
times in the movie? You saw it twice in the
movie. Yeah, and that's what they would do

951
01:22:09,978 --> 01:22:15,519
with the twice what they would fucking do. Yes,
exactly. If you look behind Adam over his right

952
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:20,821
shoulder, there is a cover of Deadpool holding
up Wolverine's body because that is all they

953
01:22:20,881 --> 01:22:25,775
fucking did in the comics was fighting each
other. Wolverine 88 this is one of my favorite

954
01:22:25,795 --> 01:22:29,916
comic covers of all time. Yep, same so fucking
good same nice color That's a great one. That

955
01:22:29,996 --> 01:22:34,379
is really good. They can't hurt each other though.
It's wasted film doesn't matter It doesn't

956
01:22:34,399 --> 01:22:38,580
matter if you ever if you ever just wanted to
get out aggression Have you never punched a

957
01:22:38,620 --> 01:22:43,663
wall or something you know the wall is not gonna
win or you're not gonna win against the wall

958
01:22:43,843 --> 01:22:50,702
I don't think I have I did that just a few hours
ago When I lost my microphone cable They're

959
01:22:50,762 --> 01:22:54,543
just they just got to get out aggression. They
don't care. They're they're definitely trying

960
01:22:54,563 --> 01:22:59,884
to kill each other But they just know it's not
gonna happen And I think the two fights were

961
01:23:00,004 --> 01:23:05,906
so drastically different in style because you
get a wide Brawl right out in the open for

962
01:23:05,926 --> 01:23:12,387
the first one and then this really nice contained
almost defensive fight Inside of the car. I

963
01:23:12,808 --> 01:23:16,349
loved it. I could have gone with another one.
Yeah for sure Oh, we kind of got it with the

964
01:23:16,369 --> 01:23:20,670
Deadpool core fight It was will ring going up
against a whole legion of Deadpools Cassandra

965
01:23:20,690 --> 01:23:24,491
Nova kills the human torch and buries Wolverine
underground with her telekinesis before using

966
01:23:24,531 --> 01:23:29,733
her tactile telepathy to read Deadpool's mind.
Wolverine stabs Cassandra Nova, who heals and

967
01:23:29,774 --> 01:23:34,816
leaves the pair to be devoured by Eliath, a
temporal entity that feeds on reality in the

968
01:23:34,856 --> 01:23:40,518
void at the end of time. Now you guys all saw
Loki, right? Absolutely. Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm

969
01:23:40,558 --> 01:23:44,460
reminded of, my son and I were discussing it
after the second time and he goes, you know,

970
01:23:44,480 --> 01:23:49,286
the thing I don't understand is I didn't identify
with like, Eliath? What was his name? And I

971
01:23:49,306 --> 01:23:54,430
go, bitch, you saw Loki season one. He goes,
yeah, but I didn't really remember. I'm like,

972
01:23:54,470 --> 01:24:00,755
well, that's on you. Why is that my problem?
Deadpool and Wolverine escape Aliyah on a jet

973
01:24:00,795 --> 01:24:05,299
powered Sentinel leg and decide to find the
resistance force in the Borderlands. They come

974
01:24:05,319 --> 01:24:10,243
across Dogpool and his owner, Nicepool, who
lends them his Honda Odyssey. This is so ridiculous

975
01:24:10,263 --> 01:24:16,788
to read out loud. Can we talk to Dogpool for
a little bit? I think the casting choice for

976
01:24:16,828 --> 01:24:22,336
Dogpool was perfect. The most ugly dog of all
time. They've actually won the 2023 Britain's

977
01:24:22,376 --> 01:24:27,481
Ugliest Dog Award. Oh, really? They cast that
thing. Yes. And it was perfect. Definitely

978
01:24:27,501 --> 01:24:31,384
didn't look like the comics version of Deadpool.
But yeah, I super appreciated this version.

979
01:24:31,504 --> 01:24:36,008
I didn't care. Yeah, I didn't care. Yeah. Wolverine
learns that Deadpool lied about the possibility

980
01:24:36,048 --> 01:24:40,471
of the TVA fixing the tragedy of his timeline
and the two fight, knocking each other unconscious.

981
01:24:40,972 --> 01:24:45,035
They're discovered by an X 23 variant who takes
them to the borderlands where they meet the

982
01:24:45,075 --> 01:24:49,899
resistance consisting of Electra, Blade and
Gambit. Together, they decide to attack Cassandra

983
01:24:49,939 --> 01:24:55,063
Nobra's brotherhood to steal Juggernaut's helmet
which offers protection from her psychic powers.

984
01:24:55,383 --> 01:24:59,086
Speaking of Juggernaut, I'm really disappointed
that Vinnie Jones didn't come back for his

985
01:24:59,126 --> 01:25:04,650
role. A little bit. This random dude did nothing
for me. Like Vinnie Jones, Olivia Munn, I don't

986
01:25:04,670 --> 01:25:08,072
know if they didn't cast them because they really
didn't need to. They didn't have speaking lines

987
01:25:08,092 --> 01:25:12,816
or anything like that or if it was a budget
concern. Maybe both. Vinnie Jones was quoted

988
01:25:12,876 --> 01:25:16,522
in an interview saying they called him for the
role. But he didn't want to do it because he

989
01:25:16,542 --> 01:25:20,443
didn't like wearing the juggernaut suit, but
he fucked up Why is he being a little bitch?

990
01:25:20,463 --> 01:25:25,444
He is. One day at work. Come on, Vinny. I tell
you what it would have been funny. That whole

991
01:25:25,464 --> 01:25:33,687
thing was a Mad Max sort of pseudoism If they'd
gotten the giant guy from Fury Road to be Juggernaut

992
01:25:33,707 --> 01:25:37,988
Yeah, was it Nathan Jones? Yeah, that would
have been a funny twist That would have been

993
01:25:38,028 --> 01:25:41,709
great. At least then it would have kind of made
sense with the Mad Max name Honestly, Vinny

994
01:25:41,729 --> 01:25:47,910
Jones probably just grew a beard, got lost the
abs after all these years. That's what CGI

995
01:25:47,930 --> 01:25:52,552
is for. Yeah, fair. The Resistance fights the
Brotherhood, and X-23 is able to decapitate

996
01:25:52,572 --> 01:25:56,493
Juggernaut and throw Deadpool the helmet, while
Cassandra Nova uses her telepathy to try and

997
01:25:56,533 --> 01:26:02,314
convince Wolverine to join her crew. Her psychic
powers are subdued, then Pyro shoots her, revealed

998
01:26:02,334 --> 01:26:06,416
to be working with Mr. Paradox in exchange for
a way out of the void. Knowing that she is

999
01:26:06,436 --> 01:26:11,477
their only way back home, Wolverine chooses
to save her life. In exchange, she uses a Doctor

1000
01:26:11,497 --> 01:26:16,396
Strange variant sling ring. to open a portal
out of the void. I don't think it's a Doctor

1001
01:26:16,416 --> 01:26:20,559
Strange sling rings. I heard a theory on this
and I'm choosing to believe it. She said like

1002
01:26:20,599 --> 01:26:26,584
a half-rate magician. I think it is a variant
of the shitty magician that they had in She-Hulk

1003
01:26:26,784 --> 01:26:31,028
that they went to court over. Johnny Blades
or Donny Blades. I think it was him. Yeah.

1004
01:26:31,048 --> 01:26:36,072
Could have been, yeah. I do feel like Strange
would have put up a better fight. I agree.

1005
01:26:36,132 --> 01:26:40,716
Kind of thing. Now, can the sling rings go through
time? Cause I feel like then why do you need

1006
01:26:40,736 --> 01:26:45,619
the time stone? Oh. Did they go through time?
Well, it went through time because like all

1007
01:26:45,639 --> 01:26:50,343
time ends at that point. It's like the end point
in time. Right. Then you know what? Yes, they

1008
01:26:50,363 --> 01:26:59,829
can. OK. All right. Sure, Jonathan. Damn it.
It's a good point. Who cares? It does seem

1009
01:26:59,869 --> 01:27:04,753
like it would be really risky to send any sort
of magician back to the void because they could

1010
01:27:04,773 --> 01:27:09,476
just escape pretty easily. Yeah. Back in Deadpool's
timeline, he and Wolverine learned that Mr.

1011
01:27:09,516 --> 01:27:13,770
Paradox's time ripper device is nearly ready.
Cassandra Nova also comes through the portal

1012
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:18,451
to take over the Time Ripper and destroy all
time except for the Void. Before Deadpool and

1013
01:27:18,471 --> 01:27:21,732
Wolverine can stop her, the Deadpool core also
comes through the portal and they're forced

1014
01:27:21,752 --> 01:27:29,055
to fight. Peter, aka Peterpool, comes in to
stop the fighting. Okay, so Peterpool, this

1015
01:27:29,095 --> 01:27:34,876
is the level of absurdity in Deadpool that I
feel like just... There's a certain absurdist

1016
01:27:34,916 --> 01:27:41,218
humor threshold that I have, and Peterpool was
that. I was like, really? That ended the whole

1017
01:27:41,258 --> 01:27:46,740
battle with the Deadpool core? It made sense.
That the do us mock in a side of him. I didn't

1018
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:51,121
know I needed it, but I'm good with it. Like
I am. I'm totally fine with it. Well, for some

1019
01:27:51,161 --> 01:27:55,242
reason, Deadpool had such a high regard of Peter.
Nobody knows why he was his favorite member

1020
01:27:55,282 --> 01:27:59,023
of the X-Horse. I like the idea of him having
such a high regard for Peter, that all the

1021
01:27:59,043 --> 01:28:02,884
Deadpools having a high regard for their universe
is Peter, that they would stop fighting just

1022
01:28:02,924 --> 01:28:08,519
for him. It made sense. OK, I'll say two things.
One. They actually kind of, I don't know if

1023
01:28:08,539 --> 01:28:12,141
this is directly related to this, but in my
mind it is, they actually set up in the scene

1024
01:28:12,161 --> 01:28:17,045
where they're, uh, the two are in the diner,
about Deadpool having ADHD, and being distracted

1025
01:28:17,085 --> 01:28:21,308
by Peter is something that would absolutely
distract all of the Deadpools, and them having

1026
01:28:21,368 --> 01:28:29,173
ADHD. Second of all, did you guys see the fucking
cojones in the suit? I tried not to, but they

1027
01:28:29,213 --> 01:28:33,937
were there. Impossible, don't you? They were
enormous. The moose knuckle was... They were

1028
01:28:33,957 --> 01:28:38,295
like, grapefruit sized. I think he has some
kind of like illness or something. They're

1029
01:28:38,335 --> 01:28:43,677
swollen. Elephantitis. I hope I'm not misremembering
this, but I think I could also see there was

1030
01:28:43,697 --> 01:28:48,199
like a little patch under his belly button that
was still open. You kind of see the ring in

1031
01:28:48,219 --> 01:28:53,381
the chain from the nipple rings and chain that
they show earlier. That's why it's funny. That

1032
01:28:53,401 --> 01:28:58,403
was such a good gag. And the fact that Hunter
B-15, I guess she's Judge B-15 now, was like

1033
01:28:58,463 --> 01:29:01,524
really into him. I thought that was hilarious.
She's like, damn, you look good in that suit.

1034
01:29:01,604 --> 01:29:10,714
Yeah. Peter Poles, man. Peter Poles. Peter fucks.
Let's be honest. Yeah, that's like a hot Odyssey.

1035
01:29:10,734 --> 01:29:14,396
Deadpool and Wolverine learn from Paradox that
in order to stop Cassandra Nova, one of them

1036
01:29:14,416 --> 01:29:18,379
will have to sacrifice themselves to destroy
the Time Ripper device. They both attempt to

1037
01:29:18,419 --> 01:29:22,702
make the sacrifice, allowing them to survive
while destroying the machine and Cassandra

1038
01:29:22,722 --> 01:29:27,185
Nova in the process. My least favorite part
of the movie was the exposition given by Paradox

1039
01:29:27,405 --> 01:29:34,722
on how anti-matter and matter combine to destroy
the universes. And only one person. can't stop

1040
01:29:34,782 --> 01:29:40,166
it and they must complete the circuit, but it
will destroy them. And I'm like, shut up, just

1041
01:29:40,546 --> 01:29:44,549
do it. I don't care how you explain it, just
say you got to destroy the device. I mean,

1042
01:29:44,829 --> 01:29:49,612
they needed to go through that though. I will
say though, if they didn't say that, then enough

1043
01:29:49,652 --> 01:29:53,255
of the nerds would bitch about why did it work
and blah, blah. Yeah, it would have been confusing.

1044
01:29:53,735 --> 01:29:58,438
That was cool with it. I like how the time ripper,
the way it destroyed universes was exactly

1045
01:29:58,478 --> 01:30:01,900
like the spaghettification that we saw in Loki
season two. I always thought that was a cool

1046
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:07,307
effect. Yeah, that was cool. to me makes sense
because now you can identify what is happening

1047
01:30:08,287 --> 01:30:13,028
in the world. TVA Judge B-15 arrives to arrest
Mr. Paradox, revealing to Deadpool and Wolverine

1048
01:30:13,048 --> 01:30:17,169
that the timeline is now healing due to Wolverine
being the new anchor. Or at least that's how

1049
01:30:17,209 --> 01:30:21,470
I understood it. She returns the resistance
members from the void to their respective timelines,

1050
01:30:21,530 --> 01:30:27,132
including X-23 who joins Logan in Wade's timeline.
They all celebrate with Wade's friends and

1051
01:30:27,172 --> 01:30:31,853
Wade reconciles with Vanessa, telling her he
saved the universe for her. And that's the

1052
01:30:31,873 --> 01:30:36,708
end of the movie. of each of the Deadpool movies
has been Vanessa. You know, that is his heart.

1053
01:30:36,768 --> 01:30:41,492
And so kind of always tying in his love for
her and the romantic element. I was very good

1054
01:30:41,512 --> 01:30:45,075
with that. The whole relationship between the
two when they weren't together was just heartbreaking

1055
01:30:45,095 --> 01:30:50,059
to me, like seeing Vanessa talking about her
new boyfriend through work and stuff like that

1056
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:54,743
and like the whole breakup conversation. He's
like, just say it like you don't want me anymore.

1057
01:30:55,044 --> 01:31:00,688
Like that was hard to watch, but it was really
nice that it ended in the way that it did where

1058
01:31:00,908 --> 01:31:04,262
they're coming back together because. They're
crazy, match each other, and they belong together.

1059
01:31:04,903 --> 01:31:08,304
That brings us to the end of the review. I don't
know if you guys have heard, but we're on Rotten

1060
01:31:08,324 --> 01:31:15,087
Tomatoes now. Yeah, you guys haven't said it
every five seconds. So I gotta give my blurb.

1061
01:31:15,347 --> 01:31:20,670
The titular duo delivers a one-two punch with
their iconic performances and brutal action

1062
01:31:20,710 --> 01:31:26,772
scenes in a chaotic, messy, and hilarious film
full of fun surprises. I'm giving the movie

1063
01:31:26,832 --> 01:31:33,395
four out of five stars a fresh rating on Rotten
Tomatoes. Can I convince you otherwise? I can

1064
01:31:33,435 --> 01:31:40,742
be convinced. Okay. So let's go through the
Deadpool films. Deadpool 1, you gave a 4. You

1065
01:31:40,782 --> 01:31:46,106
gave Deadpool 2 a 3.5 and you gave this one
a 4 now currently. I argue that this is the

1066
01:31:46,166 --> 01:31:53,032
best Deadpool film of the bunch. I think this
is the most amount of humor, the most amount

1067
01:31:53,052 --> 01:31:58,436
of fan service and overall the most fun film.
Yes, it has some faults, which I will be willing

1068
01:31:58,456 --> 01:32:03,724
to say maybe doesn't deserve a 5. But I want
to push hard for that 4.5 because going through

1069
01:32:03,744 --> 01:32:11,251
some of your other movies. Here comes we've
got. Yeah. OK, buddy. Here it comes. Buckle

1070
01:32:11,311 --> 01:32:16,195
up, Buttercup. Yeah. Blue Beetle was a four.
This is better than Blue Beetle. Simple as

1071
01:32:16,215 --> 01:32:20,739
that. Across the Spider-Verse is an amazing
film. 4.5 I think this is pretty much this

1072
01:32:20,799 --> 01:32:26,504
is the right kind of Deadpool movie. This is
the movie you need for Deadpool. I think that's

1073
01:32:26,544 --> 01:32:31,932
why this deserves to be there. Guardians 3,
4.5, this is as good as Guardians 3, without

1074
01:32:31,952 --> 01:32:38,277
question, without question. Loki season 2, 4.5,
this is as good as Loki season 2. Wakanda forever,

1075
01:32:38,457 --> 01:32:42,981
this is as good as, if not better than Wakanda
forever, I can absolutely tell you that. Multiverse

1076
01:32:43,001 --> 01:32:47,825
of Madness, this is as good or better than Multiverse
of Madness, which you gave a 4.5. Well, the

1077
01:32:47,845 --> 01:32:51,668
Batman you gave a five, and I think that's fantastic.
The Batman worked so well as a Batman movie,

1078
01:32:51,908 --> 01:32:56,346
this works so well as a Deadpool movie. The
one I really want to give it home to is you

1079
01:32:56,386 --> 01:33:01,629
gave Eternals a fucking four. You cannot give
this the same score as the Eternals. This is

1080
01:33:01,649 --> 01:33:06,291
a four point five. Are you fucking kidding me?
I knew this was coming. Reach within your soul,

1081
01:33:06,331 --> 01:33:11,353
sir. You have to give this the proper rating.
So the way I do this is if I have no notes

1082
01:33:11,493 --> 01:33:15,614
on a movie, really, if it's pretty good, I give
it four and a half. If I have no notes and

1083
01:33:15,654 --> 01:33:20,516
it exceeds my expectations, I give it a five.
If I have notes, but it's good, I give it a

1084
01:33:20,536 --> 01:33:26,952
four. That being said, any rating. I ever really
give could be plus or minus half a star. I

1085
01:33:26,972 --> 01:33:31,335
think this has notes, but also exceeds expectations.
So it's kind of got you got to bump it back

1086
01:33:31,375 --> 01:33:35,758
up for that. You're not wrong. And all the DC
movies that you listed, I don't take any credit

1087
01:33:35,778 --> 01:33:39,900
for it because Jonathan always rates his shit
half a star higher than he should. You just

1088
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:44,483
said it fluctuates within a half a star. Yeah,
but you always round up. I always round down.

1089
01:33:44,784 --> 01:33:50,359
OK. In this case, you know, I. Debated heavily
whether or not this should be four or five

1090
01:33:50,379 --> 01:33:55,781
stars and I'm willing to Four point five Round
up Four point five Come on with me guys Four

1091
01:33:55,821 --> 01:34:02,284
point five Wait, even you Jonathan Four Alright
Okay, sure It's not a hard decision to make

1092
01:34:02,344 --> 01:34:06,285
really I could easily go four point five with
this review It's a good movie I had a lot of

1093
01:34:06,305 --> 01:34:09,687
fun John, I'm assuming that you would also rate
it four point five or would you go higher?

1094
01:34:10,347 --> 01:34:13,968
Um You know what I give it? I give it a ten
A ten, a fucking ten Ten I'm giving

1095
01:34:17,366 --> 01:34:22,948
I'm giving it a five. I want to go back and
see it again. Very few of these movies do I

1096
01:34:22,988 --> 01:34:27,110
actually want to go back and see it again while
it's in theaters. I'm like, oh cool, I can't

1097
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:31,472
wait to see that again when it comes out on
Disney+. I want to go back and see it again.

1098
01:34:31,492 --> 01:34:34,974
I've already seen it twice. I'm waiting for
friends to call me and say, hey, have you seen

1099
01:34:34,994 --> 01:34:38,856
this? I'm going to be like, no, I haven't. I'm
going to go back and see it again. It's a fucking

1100
01:34:38,876 --> 01:34:45,083
five for me. Because you want to see, you want
to be there when they gasp. at fucking flame

1101
01:34:45,203 --> 01:34:49,246
on when they see Wesley Snipes, you want to
you're going to get joy out of those moments

1102
01:34:49,266 --> 01:34:53,729
from them as well. Experiencing the movie again
vicariously through people who haven't seen

1103
01:34:53,749 --> 01:34:57,712
it yet is something that I love doing with these
Marvel films. It's why I saw movies like the

1104
01:34:57,752 --> 01:35:02,495
first Avengers and even the first Deadpool movie
multiple times. I think I saw all of those

1105
01:35:02,515 --> 01:35:07,158
like six times in the theater. I would absolutely
see this movie again. It's really fun to experience.

1106
01:35:07,198 --> 01:35:13,675
It's a perfect summer movie. So a lot of people
who have been know that I don't put as much

1107
01:35:13,815 --> 01:35:20,640
stock into entertainment and quote unquote fun
as I do story. Like I want to be moved in these

1108
01:35:20,761 --> 01:35:26,265
theatrical experiences. I don't always necessarily
need to just be entertained. You must be fun

1109
01:35:26,285 --> 01:35:32,891
at parties. I tell him that all the time. I'm
sorry, Jonathan, I really am. That was low

1110
01:35:32,911 --> 01:35:39,436
hanging. Now that said, while the story I think
was bare bones here, I did think it was touching.

1111
01:35:39,636 --> 01:35:44,603
I did think it was moving. Do you think there
was heart to it? Absolutely. You know, entertainment

1112
01:35:44,643 --> 01:35:48,645
is just the cherry on top. And so when Joseph
and I were talking about, you know, oh, you

1113
01:35:48,665 --> 01:35:52,607
know, what would you rate this? That's usually
all we talk about prior to doing a review is,

1114
01:35:52,667 --> 01:35:57,149
you know, what is your star rating? I was saying
four point five. Yeah. And I think I'm going

1115
01:35:57,169 --> 01:36:02,991
to stick with that because I do think this was
intentionally so the ultimate Deadpool movie.

1116
01:36:03,391 --> 01:36:10,347
Yeah. Very fair. There you go. Four point five,
guys. Yeah. We did it! We did it! A lot of

1117
01:36:10,367 --> 01:36:16,472
that has to do with the fact that Adam has badgered
me since we did that initial Deadpool review

1118
01:36:16,913 --> 01:36:21,357
constantly about how I rated that movie wrong.
So, this is for you, man. This is for you.

1119
01:36:21,377 --> 01:36:27,382
Thank you. Thank you. But that does it for this
review, guys. John, Adam, thank you guys so

1120
01:36:27,422 --> 01:36:32,306
much for being able to do this review with us.
We truly appreciate having you guys on board.

1121
01:36:32,326 --> 01:36:37,814
We're big fans and we're really sad that Blast
From Our Past podcast is gone. I'm not gonna

1122
01:36:37,974 --> 01:36:42,557
beg you guys to bring it back because I know
that you guys are busy, you're busy men. But

1123
01:36:43,197 --> 01:36:48,180
I do expect it to eventually return one day.
Well, much like Hugh Jackman retiring from

1124
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:53,003
Wolverine, never say never. Yes. Alright. Actually,
I want to reach out and say for your final

1125
01:36:53,063 --> 01:36:58,086
episode that you guys did for that show, you
had a bunch of shows call in trying to advertise

1126
01:36:58,146 --> 01:37:04,550
their podcasts so that viewers can leave your
show and go on to theirs. I- did not submit

1127
01:37:04,670 --> 01:37:08,673
a recording in time and that will be my lifelong
regret that I didn't get to do that for you

1128
01:37:08,693 --> 01:37:12,556
guys final episode. I did think it was weird
at the time when Adam was like, oh yeah, you

1129
01:37:12,576 --> 01:37:15,197
guys could plug your show. I'm like, I don't
wanna plug my show. I just wanna talk about

1130
01:37:15,217 --> 01:37:21,341
how much Blastformer Past meant to me as a listener.
So I never got around to it. I apologize, but

1131
01:37:21,522 --> 01:37:26,385
yeah, your show meant a lot to me. You know
what the good thing is? There's still 300 episodes

1132
01:37:26,525 --> 01:37:31,168
still out there that you can go back and revisit.
That's true. And I encourage listeners to do

1133
01:37:31,208 --> 01:37:37,168
so and to listen to Throwback Trivia take down.
And we'll have to have you guys again on sometime

1134
01:37:37,428 --> 01:37:43,692
in the future. For the Cavalry movie, maybe.
You're right. No, no. I'll just sit out on

1135
01:37:43,712 --> 01:37:50,637
that review. I refuse a boycott. Always a joy
to have those guys on the show reviewing films

1136
01:37:50,657 --> 01:37:54,880
with us. Remember to check out their podcast
Throwback Trivia Take Down, of which their

1137
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:59,863
first episode, Jonathan and I were actually
contestants. And we went head to head on Marvel

1138
01:37:59,883 --> 01:38:05,055
and DC trivia. It was a whole lot of fun. Go
check them out. Absolutely. That does it for

will be of my adventures with Superman season

1146
01:38:49,102 --> 01:38:55,447
two. I really enjoyed season one. I have not
even started season two yet. No, that's a lie.

1147
01:38:55,467 --> 01:38:59,971
I've seen the first episode, maybe first two
episodes. Anyway, I'll be reviewing all of

possible. We'll talk to you guys next week.

1153
01:39:26,726 --> 01:39:33,268
Up up and away, true believers. She's a megalomaniacal
psychotic asshole, a finger licking dead inside

1154
01:39:33,328 --> 01:39:38,039
pixie slapping third rate dime store nut milk.
she can lick my god damn cinnamon ring clean

1155
01:39:38,060 --> 01:39:42,003
and kick rocks all the way to bald hell. In
fact, I don't give a shit if she removes all

1156
01:39:42,023 --> 01:39:46,407
my skin and pops me like some nightmarish blood
balloon. If the last thing I do in this godforsaken

1157
01:39:46,427 --> 01:39:50,952
cum gutter existence is light that fuckbox on
fire, I still won't die happy. That's right,

1158
01:39:51,092 --> 01:39:56,096
I won't be happy until I've urinated on her
freshly barbecued corpse and husk remains while

1159
01:39:56,136 --> 01:39:58,619
gargling juggernaut juggernuts. And you can
quote me.
