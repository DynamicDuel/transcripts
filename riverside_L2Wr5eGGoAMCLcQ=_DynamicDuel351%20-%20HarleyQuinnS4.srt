00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:32,212
a weekly show where we review superhero films
and debate the superiority between Marvel and

3
00:00:32,252 --> 00:00:38,675
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based
battle simulations. I'm Johnny DC. And I'm

4
00:00:38,695 --> 00:00:45,078
his twin brother Marvelous Joe. And in this
episode we are reviewing season 4 of the Max

5
00:00:45,138 --> 00:00:50,701
exclusive series, Harley Quinn. Watch all the
episodes at the very last minute before writing

6
00:00:50,721 --> 00:00:56,518
this review. I loved this season, love the series
overall. I feel like I keep waiting for a bad

7
00:00:56,558 --> 00:01:00,661
season of this animated series and it just hasn't
happened yet. It's really well done. Yeah,

8
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:04,524
we'll talk all about season four later on in
this episode. Before that, we're going to break

9
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:09,348
down the comic book movie news from the past
week, of which there was the Doom Patrol season

10
00:01:09,429 --> 00:01:15,334
four B official trailer. It's a trailer for
the last episodes of Doom Patrol. So this is

11
00:01:15,414 --> 00:01:21,282
a all Max episode. I'm still trying to figure
out who Max is, but As always, we list our

12
00:01:21,322 --> 00:01:25,103
segment times in our episode description, so
feel free to check out the show notes if you

13
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:29,345

our listeners may know, our dual simulator

14
00:01:29,405 --> 00:01:34,126

has named itself the artificial life form for

15
00:01:34,186 --> 00:01:41,569
running extensive duels just a rather very intelligent

30
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:04,242
past week happy birthday Abner If I could get
you any gift from the world of Marvel it would

31
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:09,770
be a spider-man suit Specifically the one with
the web armpits, you know since I know that

32
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,433
you're going skydiving for your birthday and
you're probably gonna want like a backup squirrel

33
00:03:14,473 --> 00:03:18,756
suit type thing just in case things go south
with the parachute. Not that I'm putting that

34
00:03:18,816 --> 00:03:25,601
out there. Geez. Well, in that case, I'll give
you one better than that. And that is Kite

35
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:32,505
Man's kite. The hang glider one. Hell yeah.
Thanks so much for being a patron Abner and

breaks in between a batch of episodes. Unlike
our dumbasses, why aren't we doing that? I

don't know. But also definitely while they're
on a break. Check out their back catalog of

00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:22,627
But with that out of the way, quick to the No
Prize! A No Prize is an award Marvel used to

45
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:29,663
give out to fans. is a digital award we post
on Instagram and in our email newsletter for

46
00:04:29,683 --> 00:04:34,145
the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week's question

47
00:04:34,185 --> 00:04:40,107
was, do you plan on seeing Aquaman in the Lost
Kingdom in theaters? Why or why not? And of

48
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:44,569
course, this was coming off of the first trailer
that we received for the film. The trailer

49
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:49,791
was awesome, but I still know that there's a
lot of bad taste regarding the film for a lot

50
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:57,874
of people considering not only its status within
the DCEU, but also Amber Heard. We got four

51
00:04:57,994 --> 00:05:03,476
answers. So let's break down the honorable mentions
before revealing this week's no prize winner.

52
00:05:03,956 --> 00:05:10,918
Our first honorable mention goes to Travis Bailey,
who said, Hey guys, Travis here. So my answer

53
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:18,360
would have to be a cautious yes, while I am
hyped to see Black Manta, given all the controversy

54
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:26,410
that's been happening through this movie, particularly
the whole Amber stuff. for this movie similar

55
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:32,215
to the whole Ezra Miller with Flash. So while
I will give this movie a shot, I don't expect

56
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:36,939
walking out of there saying it's gonna be a
10 out of 10 movie. This sounds like an entirely

57
00:05:37,019 --> 00:05:42,003
reasonable answer to me. For as amazing as the
trailer was, I think people have to check their

58
00:05:42,043 --> 00:05:47,188
expectations because word on the street is that
the movie is actually not that great and that

59
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:51,271
there were people walking out of the theater.
Jonathan had his own theory regarding that

60
00:05:51,431 --> 00:05:55,950
we discussed last week about why people were
walking out, but. Who knows? I do know that

61
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:00,634
a lot of people are still upset by Amber Heard's
involvement in the film, even though it sounds

62
00:06:00,654 --> 00:06:06,318
like it's been diminished considerably. I, for
one, have no problem separating art from the

63
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:12,343
artist. I see the character more as Mera, not
necessarily as Amber Heard. So I'm still looking

64
00:06:12,363 --> 00:06:16,966
forward to this movie and seeing it in theaters
despite any of that actor behind the scenes

65
00:06:17,006 --> 00:06:23,006
controversy. But remember, Jonathan, you have
to check your expectations. Like, it's gonna

66
00:06:23,026 --> 00:06:28,489
be good! You never do and you always get disappointed
when you don't? That's not always true. Our

67
00:06:28,529 --> 00:06:34,893
next honorable mention goes to Cornelius Robinson,
who said, Hey guys, this is Cornelius Robinson.

68
00:06:35,653 --> 00:06:42,837
And yes, I plan on seeing Aquaman 2 in theaters.
Why? Because not only this is the final, final

69
00:06:43,157 --> 00:06:50,101
movie in the DCEU, but judging from the preview
with the visual effects being presented, it's

70
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:56,883
required. to go see at theaters. Yeah, the special
effects look incredible, except for like one

71
00:06:56,923 --> 00:07:01,825
scene in the trailer where Aquaman was trying
to punch a submarine or underwater vessel of

72
00:07:01,865 --> 00:07:07,047
some kind. I thought all of it looked top notch.
Yeah, certainly better than the recent Flash

73
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:12,649
movie, right? Which is kind of surprising how
Warner Brothers allocates their assets, especially

74
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:17,507
for movies that are a long time coming. Both
the Flash and this Aquaman movie have been

75
00:07:17,527 --> 00:07:21,529
delayed multiple times. So it kind of made the
special effects for the Flash a little bit

76
00:07:21,549 --> 00:07:26,311
confusing, but you're right, judging from the
trailers, the visual effects for Aquaman look

77
00:07:26,351 --> 00:07:30,814
just as good as they were in the first film.
Which kind of bothers me, because I thought

78
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:35,516
that the special effects in the Flash trailers
looked great. So my biggest fear is that they're

79
00:07:35,536 --> 00:07:39,819
just polishing up all the effects that are appearing
in the trailers and not necessarily everything

80
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:45,506
for the film. I guess we'll see. We'll see.
Our final honorable mention goes to... Miggie

81
00:07:45,526 --> 00:07:50,210
Mathingian who said, Hey, what's up guys? This
is Miggie and of course I'm going to see Aquaman

82
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:56,295
the Lost Kingdom in theaters. I'm a diehard
DC fan and I see every DC movie in theaters

83
00:07:57,056 --> 00:08:02,161
and this trailer looks really good. So I'm actually
pretty excited. Yep. So keep up the good work.

84
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:07,986
Yeah. As I mentioned in our last episode, I
was ready to write this film off just because

85
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:14,090
of what's happening with the DCEU. And honestly,
I'm not even sure. whether or not Aquaman 2

86
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:20,013
counts as being a part of the DCEU or the DCU.
Like maybe Jason Momoa is going to continue

87
00:08:20,053 --> 00:08:24,955
to be Aquaman and James Gunn's new universe.
I guess we'll find out. But the trailer has

88
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:30,257
definitely re-energized my excitement for the
movie. All I can say, Miggy, is check your

89
00:08:30,317 --> 00:08:36,079
expectations. You know what, Miggy? Don't. You
know what? Raise those expectations as high

90
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:41,301
as you damn well please. Don't let anyone, especially
a Marvel guy, tell you what you should or should

91
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:46,853
not do. When Joseph tries to tell you that,
your response should be, no Joseph, fuck you.

92
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:53,377
I'm pretty sure I get told that on the Discord
like every other day, so it doesn't even phase

93
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:59,061
me anymore. That's true, we even have a GIF.
That does it for all the honorable mentions,

94
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:05,266
let's go ahead and move into the no prize winner,
who is Peter Troll, who said. Hey, it's Peter

95
00:09:05,306 --> 00:09:11,822
Troll again. I do plan on actually going to
see Aquaman, The Lost Kingdom. I think it's

96
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:15,704
gonna be a really great movie based off of how
it looks, just visually it's gonna be beautiful

97
00:09:16,304 --> 00:09:21,627
and it gave off Thor Ragnarok kind of vibes
and I love Thor Ragnarok and I think it's gonna

98
00:09:21,647 --> 00:09:26,430
be similar and if it can be, I think it's going
to be a great movie and I am so excited to

99
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:31,813
see it. Thanks guys. I'm sorry to tell you guys
but the actual correct answer for this question

100
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:36,976
of the week was no, I will not be seeing in
theaters. That's what we were looking for.

101
00:09:37,477 --> 00:09:42,680
That was the expected answer. But I guess if
you had to give the opposite answer of yes,

102
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:49,186
at least Peter Troll threw in a reference to
Thor Ragnarok. As a Marvel fan, that is why

103
00:09:49,306 --> 00:09:55,391
I give this answer the no prize win. Actually,
the correct answer was, yes, I will be seeing

104
00:09:55,411 --> 00:10:03,177
this in theaters. In fact, multiple times, probably
like five to 10 times. I really want this Aquaman

105
00:10:03,217 --> 00:10:08,001
sequel to make a billion dollars as much as
the first movie made, because I'm really sick

106
00:10:08,021 --> 00:10:13,735
and tired. of these diminishing returns on not
just DC films, but also Marvel. Yeah, superhero

107
00:10:13,755 --> 00:10:18,016
films in general have kind of seen a decline.
You're right. And the real reason that Peter

108
00:10:18,056 --> 00:10:23,197
Troll won this week's No Prize actually was
because of the Thor Ragnarok reference. A lot

109
00:10:23,237 --> 00:10:27,979
of people made references to Thor when the first
Aquaman movie came out. I think, you know,

110
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:34,260
long haired, bearded Jason Momoa is an easy
comparison to make to a character like Thor

111
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,826
played by Chris Hemsworth. They also deal with
these fantastical worlds as well. But Thor

112
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:44,888
Ragnarok was a fantastic film that was beloved
by most people. And I'm really hoping that

113
00:10:45,348 --> 00:10:51,031
Aquaman 2 captures that same kind of spirit
as a sequel. Yeah, hopefully it doesn't pull

114
00:10:51,311 --> 00:10:58,194
Thor Love and Thunder. Yes, we want Thor Ragnarok,
not Love and Thunder. Big difference. But congrats

115
00:10:58,234 --> 00:11:01,715
again to Peter Troll for winning this week's
No Prize. If you the listener want a shot at

116
00:11:01,735 --> 00:11:05,637
winning your own No Prize, stay tuned to later
on this episode when we'll be asking another

117
00:11:05,757 --> 00:11:09,281
Question of the Week. And now that that's done.
On to the news!

118
00:11:14,926 --> 00:11:20,229
Okay, so a lot of the series that first began
on the DC Universe platform back when that

119
00:11:20,249 --> 00:11:27,835
was a thing are now ending. We saw Titans recently
wrap up its final season and Doom Patrol is

120
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:33,079
also wrapping up its final season this year
with season 4. They split up this final season

121
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:38,843
into two parts and the second half of it will
be released starting October 12th. It's about

122
00:11:38,903 --> 00:11:43,670
time. I guess I actually haven't even started
season 4 yet. Yeah, and I hope this trailer

123
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:48,794
doesn't give away any spoilers because we do
learn that they lose their longevity. I'm wondering

124
00:11:48,895 --> 00:11:53,999
if that's the first half cliffhanger that gets
resolved in the second half. But either way,

125
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,083
I don't really mind knowing that the show is
so off the wall that you could basically show

126
00:11:59,203 --> 00:12:03,166
anything within these trailers and I wouldn't
be surprised. But I'll always be intrigued

127
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:06,689
because that's just the nature of the show.
They throw everything at you. Everything is

128
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:11,933
just so bizarre, but it's a great ride nonetheless.
It's been really hard for me to be sentimental.

129
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:18,312
about the ending of this series because I haven't
started its final season. This trailer, though,

130
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:24,735
made me realize just how close to the end we
are for what's been a fantastic series so far.

131
00:12:25,115 --> 00:12:28,936
At least you got four seasons of this, though.
You know, you look at a show like Daredevil

132
00:12:29,377 --> 00:12:34,659
that only got three seasons, which was also
a fantastic show. And you got to be grateful.

133
00:12:34,979 --> 00:12:39,021
I mean, that's a bad example, because isn't
Daredevil getting a fourth season on Disney

134
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:46,789
Plus? Damn right it is. You damn right it is.
Hell yeah. Hell yeah. No, but I loved Doom

135
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:51,071
Patrol. I've been super surprised by it each
and every season. And I can't wait to start

136
00:12:51,131 --> 00:12:55,414
this season because it looks like more of the
same heartfelt, comedic, bonkers storylines

137
00:12:55,634 --> 00:13:00,897
that the Doom Patrol is known for. I'm glad
to see that Timothy Dutton is returning, if

138
00:13:00,977 --> 00:13:06,160
at least for a bit, as the chief, Niles Calder,
in this season, because he was, I think, sorely

139
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,679
missed from season three. Oh, yeah, absolutely.
And it looks like a number of characters are

140
00:13:10,719 --> 00:13:15,063
returning. You know, we're getting General Immortus
again. Looks like the brain and Monsieur Mala

141
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:21,269
are making a return. Garguax, Mr. Nobody, totally
miss that guy. I can't wait to see all of them

142
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:26,373
return. I think those are just flashbacks, if
I'm not mistaken. Are they? They could be,

143
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:30,557
honestly. But then why show them in the trailer
if they're not going to show up in the season?

144
00:13:30,877 --> 00:13:34,781
Because it's kind of like a retrospective of
everything they've gone through leading into

145
00:13:34,821 --> 00:13:40,347
the series finale. Possibly, but it also does
look like a time machine is involved in this

146
00:13:40,487 --> 00:13:44,728
second half of the season in some way And you
know the fact that they're even name-dropping

147
00:13:44,768 --> 00:13:49,970
them maybe enough for me. I guess we'll see
how those episodes play out I wasn't thrilled

148
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:55,171
with how the Titans series ended I'm really
hoping that Doom Patrol has a more satisfying

149
00:13:55,291 --> 00:14:00,033
conclusion to everything Well, I think the Titan
show had a decent resolution in the final episode

150
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:04,234
when they all had dinner together, you know
and said goodbye But yeah, I'm looking for

151
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:09,057
something a little bit more substantial. Just
because the Doom Patrol show is more substantial

152
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:14,401
than most other superhero fare out there. Absolutely.
If you guys aren't watching Doom Patrol, this

153
00:14:14,461 --> 00:14:19,384
is your last chance to get caught up. So we
could all experience the final episode together

154
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:24,047
in this beautiful moment. Hopefully, we'll see
how beautiful it turns out to be. It looks

155
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:29,719
like the final episode is going to drop on November
9th of this year. Yeah, we'll be reviewing

156
00:14:29,799 --> 00:14:34,306
it, looking forward to it. Even as a Marvel
fan, I do think the show is criminally underrated.

157
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:38,152
I hope a lot of people check it out for its
resolution. But that brings us to our question

158
00:14:38,192 --> 00:14:38,613
of the week.

159
00:14:43,074 --> 00:14:50,778
What has been the most underrated Marvel or
DC TV show in your opinion and why? Yeah, what

160
00:14:50,798 --> 00:14:55,141
is the show that you think a lot of people didn't
check out but should have based on how good

167
00:15:28,054 --> 00:15:31,821
That does it for all the news for this episode,
now let's move on to the main event, where

168
00:15:31,902 --> 00:15:37,373
we review Season 4 of the Max-exclusive animated
series, Harley Quinn.

169
00:15:53,294 --> 00:15:59,136
Harley Quinn is a Max-exclusive animated series
that stars Kelly Cuoco as the title character

170
00:15:59,476 --> 00:16:06,219
and is showrun in season 4 by Sarah Peters,
as the show's former head writers, Justin Halpern

171
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:12,081
and Patrick Schumacher, left the series to write
the upcoming Kite Man spinoff series also for

172
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:17,764
Max. You'd never really have known, however,
because the show maintains its trademark balance

173
00:16:17,965 --> 00:16:23,768
of irreverence and lewd humor with heartfelt
themes and top-tier comedic voice talent. If

174
00:16:23,788 --> 00:16:28,911
you're not watching Harley Quinn by now, I'm
guessing you've probably decided that its style

175
00:16:28,951 --> 00:16:34,575
of humor is really not your thing, but I assure
you, the show is much more than the dick jokes

176
00:16:34,615 --> 00:16:39,838
they put into the marketing for the series,
which also makes my eyes roll. But season to

177
00:16:39,878 --> 00:16:45,580
season, Harley Quinn has been an absolute riot
and joy to watch. So I encourage you to do

178
00:16:45,641 --> 00:16:50,663
so if you haven't already before listening to
the spoiler review. Yeah, the show is one of

179
00:16:50,683 --> 00:16:57,146
the more consistent series that I've ever come
across. You know, almost every other superhero

180
00:16:57,186 --> 00:17:02,368
television series has like one season that dips
a little bit in quality. But season to season

181
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:07,411
with Harley Quinn has been impressively top
notch. Yeah, I don't know why season by season

182
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:13,374
I keep getting surprised by how good the writing
for this is, but it is fantastic and I laugh

183
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:19,117
every time. Yeah, I think you get reminded each
season just how good of a handle the writers

184
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:24,580
have not only on this incredible character they
developed in this world's version of Harley

185
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:29,603
Quinn, but also, you know, the grander world
building that they've done. Yeah, this world

186
00:17:29,623 --> 00:17:34,125
they've built in this alternate universe for
Harley Quinn is very well realized. I'll agree

187
00:17:34,145 --> 00:17:39,627
with that. This is only our second season that
we've reviewed on this podcast, not counting

188
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:44,848
the Valentine's Day special episode that they
released early this year. I honestly don't

189
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:50,250
have much to say about this season that I haven't
already said in the Season 3 review, but I

190
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:55,671
think that's a testament to the show's mostly
consistent nature. I will say that this season

191
00:17:55,731 --> 00:18:01,813
differs from past seasons in a number of subtle
ways, resulting in a somewhat diminished return,

192
00:18:01,993 --> 00:18:07,120
but not by much. Yeah, I think, you know, one
of the strengths of the show is that it never

193
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:12,323
fails to build on the character of Harley Quinn.
You know, she's gone tremendous character growth

194
00:18:12,363 --> 00:18:17,066
over the course of four seasons. You know, season
one was about her discovering that she can

195
00:18:17,106 --> 00:18:21,569
truly be somebody apart from the Joker. Season
two was her discovering that she was in love

196
00:18:21,589 --> 00:18:26,113
with her best friend, Poison Ivy. Season three
was about her discovering that she had a conscience

197
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:31,396
and a heroic side to her. Season four almost
felt more like an addendum to season three

198
00:18:31,456 --> 00:18:36,627
where like, I guess her big lesson was that...
She's kind of neutral. Yeah, she has a conscience,

199
00:18:36,687 --> 00:18:42,711
but also she doesn't want to be a hero, right?
So that type of revelation isn't quite as profound

200
00:18:42,811 --> 00:18:47,234
necessarily. So the season overall had less
of those profound moments, even though it was

201
00:18:47,254 --> 00:18:52,257
still enjoyable. Yeah, I'll touch more on the
themes later, but I agree. You know, last season

202
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:57,701
we saw Harley's heroic inclination begin to
develop. So in this season, she's a fledgling

203
00:18:57,741 --> 00:19:03,356
member of the Bat family. and with Ivy's foray
into executive management of the world's largest

204
00:19:03,436 --> 00:19:08,300
villain organization, the Legion of Doom, it
wasn't surprising that the two of them would

205
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,863
spend more time apart than in past seasons and
that heartfelt romantic nature of the show

206
00:19:13,883 --> 00:19:18,947
would take a dip. But, you know, over the past
couple of seasons, and especially with the

207
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:24,010
Valentine's Day special, I don't mind a break
from the romance. And the conflict brought

208
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:28,693
about by Harley and Ivy's new professions kept
the pace running smooth for the most part.

209
00:19:29,214 --> 00:19:32,936
Yeah, I mean, it was a great setup. I wasn't
sure that they could deliver on the setup of

210
00:19:33,056 --> 00:19:37,978
Ivy running the Legion of Doom and Harley joining
the Bat family. But for the most part, I do

211
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:42,741
think that they landed the concept. Yeah, I
agree. I do have to say I feel like the show

212
00:19:42,801 --> 00:19:48,144
has definitely lost a lot of the charm brought
on by its ensemble cast, particularly this

213
00:19:48,184 --> 00:19:52,886
season, you know, with the absence of Kite Man
and why it felt like a diminished role for

214
00:19:52,946 --> 00:19:58,469
King Shark. I do miss some of the banter and
comedic hijinks between Harley's old crew.

215
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:05,133
Though I will admit we got just the right amount
of Clayface and Bane this season. Nora carried

216
00:20:05,173 --> 00:20:09,856
a lot of that side story weight much better
than I thought she would. Nora was freaking

217
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:14,998
hilarious. She was such a minor character before
this, but like the fact that they kind of elevated

218
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:20,842
her to side character status was brilliant because
she's freaking hilarious. Who's the actress

219
00:20:20,862 --> 00:20:23,883
that does her voice? It kept like driving me
crazy that I could recognize it, but couldn't

220
00:20:23,903 --> 00:20:28,566
pin it down. Rachel Dratch from SNL. Oh, that's
right. OK. Alright, that makes sense. It was

221
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:33,228
hilarious. I love that she did the voice. She
did a fantastic job. I thought we were going

222
00:20:33,268 --> 00:20:37,630
to get a lot more out of the Bat family this
season, but of course, you know, the lack of

223
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:43,272
side characters allowed the writers to further
dive into the two leads of Harley and Ivy,

224
00:20:43,332 --> 00:20:48,575
which was great. Now each of the two leads,
Harley and Ivy, got their own separate cast

225
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:53,857
of side characters this season, with each also
struggling to achieve acceptance and maintain

226
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:59,327
those relationships. Interestingly, I think
by the end, the overall theme of the season

227
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:04,089
that both Harley and Ivy learned was that they
shouldn't depend on acceptance from others

228
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:08,971
if they're unable to accept themselves. I thought
it was an interesting theme like very Thelma

229
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:13,453
and Louise, us against the world kind of approach
and I'm curious to see where it leads with

230
00:21:13,473 --> 00:21:18,636
Harley and Ivy having burned a lot of bridges
this season. You know, they formed the Gotham

231
00:21:18,656 --> 00:21:23,714
City Sirens with Catwoman and Batgirl at the
very end, but I have no idea. what that team

232
00:21:23,734 --> 00:21:28,776
is going to do. Like, are they good? Are they
bad? Who knows? But I'm excited to see. Stan,

233
00:21:28,936 --> 00:21:33,338
you know, that's a great testament to the quality
of the show is that even four seasons out,

234
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:37,620
they're still finding new ways to approach these
characters. Like, I'm super excited with the

235
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,942
Gotham City Sirens. I'm really excited to see
what happens with Nightwing and the whole Lazarus

236
00:21:41,982 --> 00:21:46,163
pit situation. Because that was one of the threads
that I was hoping that they wouldn't abandon

237
00:21:46,183 --> 00:21:50,225
because it felt like they were just gonna drop
the whole Nightwing thing. Like, she got away

238
00:21:50,245 --> 00:21:53,967
with it, you know? But I'm really glad they
didn't do that. And it looks like one of the

239
00:21:54,008 --> 00:21:58,811
major plot threads for next season is going
to be Harley Quinn's comeuppance for her actions

240
00:21:59,011 --> 00:22:03,274
during this season. Right. Yeah, I agree. I
wouldn't be surprised if, you know, a lot of

241
00:22:03,314 --> 00:22:07,938
the conflict comes next season from Harley's
guilt over killing Nightwing, you know, with

242
00:22:08,058 --> 00:22:12,561
Batgirl on her team. And maybe eventually Batgirl
learns and forms a rival team, the Birds of

243
00:22:12,601 --> 00:22:17,545
Prey, with Black Canary and Huntress or something
like that. That would be cool, I think. That

244
00:22:17,565 --> 00:22:22,887
would be cool. Yeah. The Nightwing death was
spoiled for me, unfortunately, before I started

245
00:22:22,927 --> 00:22:26,969
watching the series. Again, for these reviews,
I like to watch as much of the show in one

246
00:22:26,989 --> 00:22:32,171
piece as I can, so I kind of waited to the last
minute to even start this season. But like

247
00:22:32,211 --> 00:22:35,772
you, I'm really glad with the way they resolved
that in the end, because I was about to be

248
00:22:35,872 --> 00:22:41,815
pissed off. If anything, it's almost like this
season could have done with a few more episodes,

249
00:22:41,835 --> 00:22:46,217
because I think most Harley Quinn seasons are
like 13 episodes, but this one was only 10.

250
00:22:46,817 --> 00:22:51,674
Season three was also 10 episodes. Well, I guess
not counting the Valentine's Day special. Right,

251
00:22:51,694 --> 00:22:55,976
yeah, I saw that they counted the Valentine's
Day special as episode 11 of season three,

252
00:22:56,096 --> 00:23:01,637
which was strange, I thought. One major component
missing from this season that I felt was sorely

253
00:23:01,697 --> 00:23:06,879
lacking was the introspective psychological
analysis we get of certain characters that

254
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:12,681
happens at least once per season. Last season
we got to go into Bruce Wayne's mind, which

255
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:18,531
ended up being my favorite episode of the series
so far. Prior to that, we delved into The Joker,

256
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:24,636
Ivy, and Harley, but nothing this season. For
a show starring a former psychologist, I thought

257
00:23:24,656 --> 00:23:29,259
they would keep that aspect of the show running,
and I definitely thought the sleepwalking storyline

258
00:23:29,479 --> 00:23:34,683
this season was going to lead to something like
that, but that ended on an unsatisfying note,

259
00:23:34,763 --> 00:23:39,762
I'd say, with Harley's random ass potato clone.
That's true. Yeah, that was definitely the

260
00:23:39,802 --> 00:23:44,145
most unsatisfying aspect about the season was
that they introduced this element that they

261
00:23:44,245 --> 00:23:49,548
never really followed through on. I don't remember
Harley sleepwalking at any point during the

262
00:23:49,568 --> 00:23:55,531
whole series, and I think they tried to rationalize
her disorder as due to her inability to cope

263
00:23:55,551 --> 00:24:00,134
with the loss of her villainous side. But it
didn't ring true for me. Totally. I totally

264
00:24:00,154 --> 00:24:04,916
get it. Let's talk more about that and Harley
Quinn in our character breakdown. Now, Harley

265
00:24:04,936 --> 00:24:10,461
Quinn was voiced by Kelly Cuoco. who by now
portrays my favorite version of Harley Quinn

266
00:24:10,822 --> 00:24:16,088
in any medium. I've said this before, but I
would love it if James Gunn used Kelly Cuoco

267
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:21,794
and Lake Bell to portray their live action counterparts
as part of the new DC University's building,

268
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:27,006
but I'm not holding my breath. They would be
great. For sure. This season, Harley struggles

269
00:24:27,046 --> 00:24:32,488
with her foray into superheroism alongside the
Bat Family while Bruce Wayne is incarcerated.

270
00:24:32,648 --> 00:24:37,750
Unable to get a flow with the team, whether
due to their no killing rule, her poor eyesight,

271
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:42,953
or stubbornness against training under Alfred,
Harley also had to face Nightwing's distrust

272
00:24:43,193 --> 00:24:48,495
and the relationship ethics of going to Ivy
with her problems. This all compounds into

273
00:24:48,555 --> 00:24:53,437
bouts of sleepwalking where Harley fulfills
her destructive desires, which leads up to

274
00:24:53,477 --> 00:24:59,376
her killing Nightwing. Unable to deal with that
guilt, Harley is forced to face the fact that

275
00:24:59,397 --> 00:25:05,621
she can't cut it as a hero, and decides to embrace
both her good and evil natures. I think the

276
00:25:05,661 --> 00:25:10,464
sleepwalking was brought about entirely by stress.
Like you mentioned, because she was unable

277
00:25:10,505 --> 00:25:15,628
to fulfill her villainous tendencies like were
expressed by the whole Hargrit alter ego that

278
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:20,292
she developed when they went to Vegas. If anything,
she probably should have maintained that for

279
00:25:20,332 --> 00:25:25,588
her own mental health, right? Right. Yeah. Lots
of superheroes have secret identities, and

280
00:25:25,768 --> 00:25:29,611
the fact that her alter ego was a villain I
think would have been kind of an interesting

281
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:33,395
thing to explore further. Yeah, I think they
could have easily gotten a few more episodes

282
00:25:33,415 --> 00:25:37,538
out of this season. I would have definitely
loved to have seen a return of Hargret. Moving

283
00:25:37,658 --> 00:25:44,164
on to Poison Ivy, she was voiced by Lake Bell
to perfection. I'd say this is also my favorite

284
00:25:44,224 --> 00:25:49,074
version of Poison Ivy now. who I feel like DC
has had a hard time balancing in the comics

285
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:55,236
as both a sexual femme fatale for Batman and
a queer icon that subverts gender expectations.

286
00:25:55,256 --> 00:26:00,458
Ivy's arc this season was very similar to Harley's
in that she struggled in this new environment

287
00:26:00,498 --> 00:26:05,320
around new people, with her being the new CEO
of the Legion of Doom, you know, working for

288
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,841
the undercutting and mansplaining Glex Luthor
while trying to push her socially conscious

289
00:26:09,981 --> 00:26:15,484
evil initiative. Between keeping employees happy
while navigating the high class yet cutthroat

290
00:26:15,524 --> 00:26:20,567
world of female business elites, or championing
your image and brand on social media while

291
00:26:20,587 --> 00:26:25,949
mentoring the next generation of aspiring and
talented women, it's a lot to balance. And

292
00:26:26,029 --> 00:26:31,833
despite Ivy's competence, she ultimately comes
up short, learning that by trying to please

293
00:26:31,973 --> 00:26:37,636
everyone, she ends up pleasing no one, especially
herself, as she ends up embarrassed in her

294
00:26:37,676 --> 00:26:42,474
public confrontation with Lex Luthor at the
end of the season. Through her failure, she

295
00:26:42,514 --> 00:26:48,116
learns that her success should be on her own
terms, and manages at the very end to get revenge

296
00:26:48,216 --> 00:26:53,618
on all of her enemies, making her, in my opinion,
the most interesting character this season.

297
00:26:54,058 --> 00:27:00,040
I was just about to say that. I do think that
between the two main arcs of Ivy's Legion of

298
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:06,239
Doom situation and Harley joining the Bat Family,
I prefer Poison Ivy's story, largely because

299
00:27:06,479 --> 00:27:11,321
I feel like Harley's time with the Bat family
was dismissive. Like they had a dismissive

300
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:16,363
attitude toward Harley and it never quite felt
like she ever became a part of what they had,

301
00:27:16,523 --> 00:27:21,566
you know? Well, I mean, the Legion of Doom was
just as dismissive to Poison Ivy, but I think

302
00:27:21,746 --> 00:27:26,948
Ivy did more about it. Like she was less whiny,
she was more active, she was more proactive,

303
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:32,119
you know, teaming up and taking advice with
people like Talia. Yeah, and I felt like overall

304
00:27:32,139 --> 00:27:35,823
we just got more screen time with Ivy for some
reason. I'm not sure if that's the case, but

305
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:40,187
it definitely felt like that. Yeah, you might
be right. There's, of course, a ton more characters

306
00:27:40,227 --> 00:27:45,032
to talk about. But one character I wanted us
to focus on was the villain this season, Lex

307
00:27:45,112 --> 00:27:50,962
Luthor. He is voiced by Giancarlo Esposito,
who kills it as the character. Like every time

308
00:27:51,022 --> 00:27:55,823
I hear his voice, I just remember how brilliant
and menacing he was on Breaking Bad. And I

309
00:27:55,843 --> 00:28:01,405
just have to admire the fact that the casting
director landed an actor of Giancarlo Esposito's

310
00:28:01,425 --> 00:28:07,707
caliber in an animated show with dick jokes.
I'm glad that I largely forget who the voice

311
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:13,029
talent is for these seasons and just being reminded
that it is Giancarlo Esposito makes it so much

312
00:28:13,069 --> 00:28:18,080
better in hindsight. Yeah, I would love to see
Giancarlo play a live action Lex Luther in

313
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:23,785
like a Kingdom Come Elseworlds project. That
would be incredible for sure. Or even in James

314
00:28:23,825 --> 00:28:29,189
Gunn's new DCU. He might be a little old for
that, but maybe not. Maybe I'm wrong. Lex definitely

315
00:28:29,229 --> 00:28:34,193
had a larger role this season than I thought
he was going to have because, you know, in

316
00:28:34,253 --> 00:28:38,276
previous seasons, he's been relegated to kind
of a figurehead. Kind of it was very much a

317
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:42,891
supporting role as opposed to this season. I
just loved everything that they chose to do

318
00:28:42,911 --> 00:28:47,555
with this character. Like he was like injecting
himself with like Falcon DNA, you know, to

319
00:28:47,595 --> 00:28:51,998
try to get his hair to grow back and lifted
his cheekbones and those chicken breast caffeine

320
00:28:52,018 --> 00:28:56,461
plants. Right. Everything was so hilarious.
It was great. And it made total sense for the

321
00:28:56,481 --> 00:29:01,345
character because for the most part, Lex Luthor
has always been trying to compete with the

322
00:29:01,625 --> 00:29:06,809
superior specimen that is Superman. Right. So
it totally makes sense that he's kind of like.

323
00:29:07,222 --> 00:29:11,305
doing all this shit to his body, like bathing
in baby seal blood and stuff like that to try

324
00:29:11,345 --> 00:29:16,130
to achieve that perfection. Right, yeah I thought
it totally made sense for the character. You

325
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:21,074
know, Lex Luthor in this season he makes Ivy
the CEO of the Legion of Doom not only for

326
00:29:21,114 --> 00:29:26,399
the public optics of having a woman-led legion,
but also because it allowed him to focus on

327
00:29:26,439 --> 00:29:32,505
his master plan of destroying and replacing
Superman, which I thought was a pretty decent

328
00:29:32,585 --> 00:29:38,695
plan. Of course, his unveiling of a moon-based
laser that could increase Earth's ozone layer

329
00:29:38,955 --> 00:29:44,437
to repair holes in it was mocked as stealing
Ivy's socially conscious evil idea, but it

330
00:29:44,497 --> 00:29:49,578
proved to be an effective and new way to bring
down Superman by blocking out the sun. Like

331
00:29:49,598 --> 00:29:54,760
you mentioned, watching Lex throughout the season
preparing to supplant Superman by perfecting

332
00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:00,582
his physical body through caftoning and regrowing
his hair was not only fairly humorous, But

333
00:30:00,622 --> 00:30:05,405
it resulted in what I thought was a satisfying
evil master plan for the series overall and

334
00:30:05,445 --> 00:30:10,089
definitely led to higher stakes than what I
thought was just going to be cheekbone implants

335
00:30:10,129 --> 00:30:16,794
for vanity's sake. Yeah. When Harley and Ivy
realized that, wait, was this all just a plot

336
00:30:16,874 --> 00:30:23,299
to get at Superman? I was legitimately impressed
at how good of a plan it was. Yeah. But let's

337
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:26,301
talk more about that plan in our story highlights.

338
00:30:33,858 --> 00:30:39,903
Episode 1 was titled Gotham's Hottest Hotties.
In it, Poison Ivy, the new CEO of the Legion

339
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:45,207
of Doom, struggles to gain her employees' respect
on her first day on the job. She approves all

340
00:30:45,247 --> 00:30:50,211
of their evil plans in an attempt to win them
over, but this backfires when Bane blows up

341
00:30:50,251 --> 00:30:55,636
an oil rig, causing chemical pollution in the
sea, which Ivy had originally wanted to prevent.

342
00:30:56,237 --> 00:31:01,221
After some encouragement from Nora Freeze and
a fight with Snowflame, Ivy stands up to the

343
00:31:01,241 --> 00:31:07,206
Legionnaires. and hires Nora as her assistant.
Meanwhile, a serial killer is targeting Gotham's

344
00:31:07,246 --> 00:31:12,431
hottest people, which Harley investigates with
the Bat Family and eventually realizes that

345
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:17,555
Professor Pig is the killer. Pig is trying to
surgically create the hottest human specimen

346
00:31:17,816 --> 00:31:23,861
by using his victim's best body parts. Using
Nightwing's perfect ass's bait, the Bat Family

347
00:31:23,921 --> 00:31:29,994
captures Pig, but Harley goes too far and kills
him, to her teammate's horror. Meanwhile, King

348
00:31:30,034 --> 00:31:36,116
Shark's wife Tabitha is expecting babies and
Talia Al Ghul decides to travel to Gotham after

349
00:31:36,156 --> 00:31:41,577
hearing about Wayne Enterprises financial problems.
It was kind of cool to see how the Bat Family

350
00:31:41,617 --> 00:31:46,799
took on a Bat Rogue in Professor Peg. I wish
we got a little bit more of that this season

351
00:31:46,899 --> 00:31:52,000
for sure, but I also thought the stuff between
the Legion of Doom employees and Poison Ivy

352
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:56,942
this episode was great. It was a great first
episode to the season overall. There were a

353
00:31:57,022 --> 00:32:01,463
lot of moments that had me laughing my ass off
during this first episode. I love the part

354
00:32:01,543 --> 00:32:06,384
when the Legion of Doom roundtable was like
telling Poison Ivy get out of the way because

355
00:32:06,404 --> 00:32:11,146
they want to see who the new CEO is. And then
she was like, I am the new CEO. And then Mattello

356
00:32:11,166 --> 00:32:17,428
was like, oh, fuck, the rumors were true. It
was so good. And then later on, he was like,

357
00:32:17,488 --> 00:32:21,009
so in a hissy fit. Yeah. And then later on,
he was like, if we wanted to be bust around

358
00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:27,195
by a woman, we'd get girlfriends. I like the
part where they're like, she probably slept

359
00:32:27,235 --> 00:32:33,700
with Lux to get the position. I hope she gets
pregnant. It was so bizarre. So hilarious though.

360
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:40,104
The scene where Harley Quinn stages a nude photo
shoot with Nightwing to draw Professor Pig

361
00:32:40,164 --> 00:32:45,508
was freaking hilarious. Like all of the direction
that she was sending his way was top-notch

362
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:49,150
writing for sure. I would have loved to have
been a fly on the wall in the writer's room

363
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:53,793
while they were coming up with those ideas for
how Nightwing should pose. It was just great.

364
00:32:54,334 --> 00:32:59,376
Oh man, I bet the writers room is just non-stop
them cracking up. Yeah, holy cow. How could

365
00:32:59,416 --> 00:33:07,181
it not be? Episode 2 was titled B.I.T.C.H. Ivy
attends a networking event for evil businesswomen

366
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:13,464
and meets Talia, the conservator of Wayne Enterprises
while Bruce Wayne is imprisoned. Talia advises

367
00:33:13,664 --> 00:33:19,027
Ivy on her plan to legally replace Gotham's
male trees with female trees, which unknown

368
00:33:19,047 --> 00:33:24,995
to Talia would ruin Wayne Enterprises' pharmaceuticals
division. and Ivy and Talia develop a mutual

369
00:33:25,035 --> 00:33:30,017
respect for each other's intellect and villainy.
As punishment for breaking the Bat Family's

370
00:33:30,137 --> 00:33:36,461
no-killing rule, Harley is demoted to Alfred's
assistant. Alfred teaches her a technique called

371
00:33:36,861 --> 00:33:44,265
BITCH. Breathe, identify the problem, T-break,
consider your options, handle it, which she

372
00:33:44,445 --> 00:33:49,628
uses to stop Alfred from robbing a bank. The
Bat Family is impressed by Harley's actions

373
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:55,983
and gives her own bat outfit. Alfred is arrested
and sent to Arkham Asylum for rehabilitation.

374
00:33:56,323 --> 00:34:02,586
I gotta say, I'm gonna start using the bitch
method in real life. It's not bad advice. I

375
00:34:02,606 --> 00:34:07,067
don't know what use the tea break has, but I'm
sure, you know, helps with lowering your blood

376
00:34:07,107 --> 00:34:11,969
pressure, just calming down and stuff. Teas
just delicious, you know, you need a reason

377
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:17,132
for it. The whole Alfred arc here just had me
dying. Like the character was so hilarious.

378
00:34:17,253 --> 00:34:20,815
This whole episode, when it turned out that
he was trying to get arrested so that he could

379
00:34:20,855 --> 00:34:25,378
be back with his master Wayne again, I thought
it was hilarious. And even later on during

380
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:30,422
the course of the season when he became like
this gourmet hooch wine creator was just brilliant,

381
00:34:30,482 --> 00:34:36,646
I think, for the character. Yeah, white color
wine. Yeah. One of my favorite jokes for this

382
00:34:36,686 --> 00:34:41,829
episode was when Harley finally got her bat
costume for stopping Alfred. And Robin was

383
00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:46,768
like, snitches get stitches, but he was talking
about the stitch work on her costume, right?

384
00:34:46,788 --> 00:34:50,910
I thought that was pretty good. Right. Yeah.
I don't think Robin was as funny this season

385
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:55,513
as he has been in past seasons, like where he
had like a crush on Harley and stuff like that.

386
00:34:55,973 --> 00:34:59,515
His dynamic with his mom was pretty good. I
thought that was funny. Yeah, that was good.

387
00:34:59,595 --> 00:35:04,858
It was great to see Talia this season for sure.
Moving on to episode three that was titled

388
00:35:05,018 --> 00:35:11,181
Icons Only. Harley and Ivy go to Las Vegas for
a vacation, hoping to see Clayface's new show.

389
00:35:11,554 --> 00:35:16,516
though all of the tickets are sold out, and
Harley realizes that her hero reputation has

390
00:35:16,576 --> 00:35:21,678
made her an outcast in the villain community.
After seeing that Bruce Wayne can be a DJ in

391
00:35:21,718 --> 00:35:27,580
prison while still maintaining his public identity,
she decides to create a fake identity for herself

392
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:33,723
as well, calling herself Hargrit. She enjoys
her time with Ivy as Hargrit until Clayface

393
00:35:33,783 --> 00:35:39,165
foils their attempt to steal tickets to a show
as revenge for Ivy not keeping in touch with

394
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:44,301
him. This results in a fight between the two,
which is interrupted by Tabitha giving birth

395
00:35:44,341 --> 00:35:50,305
to nine shark babies. Tabitha agrees to co-parent
one of the babies with King Shark, who gets

396
00:35:50,345 --> 00:35:56,330
the rest, and chooses Harley and Ivy to be the
children's godparents. Afterward, Ivy admits

397
00:35:56,370 --> 00:36:00,553
that she was worried that she and Harley would
have nothing in common anymore because of their

398
00:36:00,593 --> 00:36:05,877
different jobs. Harley then announces that she
is moving in with the Bat family to learn more

399
00:36:05,917 --> 00:36:11,517
about being a hero. Ivy sad to hear this, but
she supports Harley's decision. This episode

400
00:36:11,557 --> 00:36:18,022
kind of felt like a break from the normal storyline,
and I think it was there really just to maintain

401
00:36:18,062 --> 00:36:23,366
the relationship of Harley and Ivy, because
for a large portion of this season, the two

402
00:36:23,427 --> 00:36:28,130
really aren't together kind of tackling life
side by side. Right, well it's kind of a shame

403
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:32,614
though that they introduced one of the season's
more compelling concepts in the alter ego thing,

404
00:36:32,634 --> 00:36:37,634
considering that this was kind of like a side
story episode. I think you're right. in terms

405
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:42,865
of the level of clay face that was in this season.
I think he was getting a little grating in

406
00:36:42,905 --> 00:36:47,213
previous seasons and how much he was included.
Right. Plus after the guy falls in love with

407
00:36:47,253 --> 00:36:53,127
his own ass, like, where do you go from there?
That's right. I'm wondering how they go from

408
00:36:53,207 --> 00:36:58,751
that, though, to having him be like this super
successful mega celebrity star with his own

409
00:36:58,771 --> 00:37:03,914
review show in Vegas. Well, he became like a
superstar with the whole Batman movie at the

410
00:37:03,934 --> 00:37:08,117
end of season three, where he was pretending
to be Billy Bob Thornton. So I could see how

411
00:37:08,157 --> 00:37:13,021
he could segue that into a successful Las Vegas
career. I did love the fight between him and

412
00:37:13,061 --> 00:37:17,444
Harley. I think it just really showed how much
of a powerhouse those two characters are. That

413
00:37:17,464 --> 00:37:23,933
was some awesome action this season. Yeah, speaking
of fights, one of the amenities at the Lexor

414
00:37:23,953 --> 00:37:28,176
Hotel for the villains was that they could bet
on gladiatorial matches, which I thought was

415
00:37:28,216 --> 00:37:32,779
pretty interesting. I think the first fight
was between Doll Man and Ragdoll, which was

416
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:36,903
perfect. I thought that was great. It just reminded
me of Dynamic Duel for some reason. I was like,

417
00:37:37,123 --> 00:37:42,487
oh yeah, this is cool. I just love that was
a thing though at Lexor. Instead of the Luxor,

418
00:37:42,707 --> 00:37:49,740
hilarious hilarity. the first person to come
back from a business conference without chlamydia,

419
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:54,923
which has to be a record for like the longest
episode title of a television show ever. Hyvi

420
00:37:54,943 --> 00:38:00,566
attends Malcon, a supervillain convention on
the moon, where she expects to give a presentation,

421
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:05,870
but is instead asked to give an opening speech
for Luther's presentation. Following Talia's

422
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:10,973
advice, she decides to network with other villains
and impresses them with her ideas, including

423
00:38:11,053 --> 00:38:16,289
Steppenwolf. As Luther gives his presentation,
he realizes that everyone is more interested

424
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:21,694
in Ivy than him, which angers him and causes
him to destroy his lunar base and call off

425
00:38:21,714 --> 00:38:27,319
the convention. Meanwhile, due to Talia cutting
the Bat Family's budget, Harley teaches them

426
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,503
how to fight without weapons and gadgets and
rents out Wayne Manor to Scandinavian tourists

427
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:38,028
to make more money. When the Scandinavians try
to rob the manor, the Bat Family uses Harley's

428
00:38:38,068 --> 00:38:43,940
teachings to stop them. After Harley sells some
of Ivy's panties online to exploit her newfound

429
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:49,103
fame, the Bat Family is able to buy new equipment.
As they check the Batcave's security footage,

430
00:38:49,363 --> 00:38:53,966
they miss the footage of Harley sleepwalking
and wrecking havoc in the manor during the

431
00:38:54,026 --> 00:38:59,909
night. Which is a clue to her whole arc a little
too little too late. Perhaps I didn't love

432
00:38:59,929 --> 00:39:04,432
the Bat Family arc for this episode. I think
this is where Poison Ivy started to become

433
00:39:04,452 --> 00:39:08,226
a little bit more interesting to me for this
season. I love- how she kind of just took over

434
00:39:08,366 --> 00:39:12,867
the convention on the moon, knocking people
like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg off their

435
00:39:12,887 --> 00:39:17,268
villain panels, which I thought was hilarious.
Yeah, I agree. Loved the Poison Ivy stuff,

436
00:39:17,308 --> 00:39:21,970
loved everything about it in this episode. It
didn't make sense to me in the Harley Quinn

437
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:27,291
portion why she was training the Bat Family
how to fight without weapons and gadgets because

438
00:39:27,391 --> 00:39:32,333
they already fucking know how to do that. It's
the Bat Family, as if Batman would not train

439
00:39:32,353 --> 00:39:37,078
them how to fight without weapons. That's an
absurd notion to me. Yeah, I think that's just

440
00:39:37,098 --> 00:39:42,220
part of the gag was that they had become too
reliant on their bat gear. But yeah, the idea

441
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:47,222
of Harley Quinn training them in hand-to-hand
combat felt very off. And the whole storyline

442
00:39:47,442 --> 00:39:52,765
seemed very random, like Scandinavian tourists.
I mean, the show is kind of humorous in its

443
00:39:52,805 --> 00:39:58,147
randomness, but that just seemed like okay.
Yeah, I was expecting them to be like name

444
00:39:58,327 --> 00:40:02,489
super villains or something like that. But no,
they were just really just Scandinavian Airbnb

445
00:40:02,529 --> 00:40:08,719
guests who were high on drugs. Episode five
was titled Getting Ice Stick. Don't wait up.

446
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:16,242
I honestly, when I saw the title for the episode,
I was going in a completely different direction.

447
00:40:16,282 --> 00:40:19,664
I was thinking Dick Grayson or something like
that, you know, I think the bad family was

448
00:40:19,704 --> 00:40:24,366
off getting ice or something. But when I realized
what the title was in reference to, I was laughing

449
00:40:24,406 --> 00:40:30,268
my ass off. That is funny. Now, Harley Quinn
has eye surgery performed by Supergirl. I'm

450
00:40:30,288 --> 00:40:35,078
not sure why to improve her vision for night
missions. She calls Barbara Gordon to pick

451
00:40:35,098 --> 00:40:40,941
her up, but is instead met by Barbara's roommate,
Alyssa, who found Barbara's phone. Nightwing

452
00:40:40,981 --> 00:40:46,084
tells Harley that Barbara has gone missing,
but refuses to let Harley help find her because

453
00:40:46,124 --> 00:40:52,308
he doesn't trust her. Meanwhile, Lex Luthor
assigns his PR team, the Johns, to manage Poison

454
00:40:52,388 --> 00:40:57,771
Ivy's career. They convince Ivy to increase
her social media activity to gain more followers.

455
00:40:58,191 --> 00:41:04,234
As a result, Ivy neglects her relationships
with Harley and her mentees, Tara, Volkanna,

456
00:41:04,494 --> 00:41:09,317
and Te Faye Holland. Harley finds Barbara in
the mountains and goes there with Alyssa to

457
00:41:09,357 --> 00:41:13,800
save her. Harley discovers that Barbara is in
the mountains and goes there with Alyssa to

458
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:18,803
save her. They learn that Barbara went there
to bring her mother home from the family cabin

459
00:41:19,163 --> 00:41:24,366
after Jim Gordon rushed back to Gotham to accept
a security job at the Legion of Doom headquarters.

460
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:29,269
Harley laments that she gave up everything from
her previous life to join the Bat Family, but

461
00:41:29,329 --> 00:41:34,355
still doesn't feel accepted. Barbara assures
her that it takes time just before they find

462
00:41:34,456 --> 00:41:39,218
Nightwing's dead body, which shocks them both.
And again, I wasn't shocked here because I

463
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:43,001
knew Nightwing was going to die. I guess it
just kind of threw me in the way that they

464
00:41:43,281 --> 00:41:46,843
just tacked that on at the end of the episode.
It seemed like something very big and I was

465
00:41:46,863 --> 00:41:52,042
like, wait, what? Yeah, I was shocked for sure.
I did not see that coming. Overall, I think

466
00:41:52,062 --> 00:41:56,944
this is my least favorite episode though, largely
because I really did not like whatever joke

467
00:41:56,964 --> 00:42:00,925
they were doing with the Johns. I just don't
think it landed for me and they kept repeating

468
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:05,667
it. And I didn't like that Nightwing died. Yeah,
I could see how the Johns kind of overstayed

469
00:42:05,687 --> 00:42:11,129
their welcome. I thought it was great at first
though. I also did like Ivy's group of mentees,

470
00:42:11,229 --> 00:42:14,763
how they were all like elemental in nature.
I thought that was a really cool team. Yeah,

471
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:18,865
that was fun. I think actually the biggest gem
that came out of this episode, everything else

472
00:42:18,905 --> 00:42:24,670
aside, was the annual boys night out with the
cold themed superheroes like Captain Cold and

473
00:42:24,730 --> 00:42:29,293
Isocal. Yeah. I thought that was hilarious.
And they were just like playing in the snow,

474
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:34,056
having a snowball fight and their underwear.
I agree. That was probably my favorite part

475
00:42:34,096 --> 00:42:39,680
of the episode, too. But moving on to the next
episode, episode six was titled Metamorphosis

476
00:42:40,321 --> 00:42:45,159
after Nightwing's funeral. Harley, Batgirl,
and Robin go their separate ways to avoid being

477
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:50,842
killed. Harley learns about her sleepwalking
from Frank after he witnesses it when she returns

478
00:42:50,862 --> 00:42:55,485
to Catwoman's apartment. Lucius discovers that
Nightwing's tracker pinpoints the Legion of

479
00:42:55,525 --> 00:43:00,528
Doom's headquarters, leading Barbara to believe
that Ivy is behind the murder, which Harley

480
00:43:00,568 --> 00:43:06,231
refuses to believe. The tracker is later found
by Gordon in a parking garage but is no longer

481
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:06,811
traceable.

482
00:43:11,734 --> 00:43:17,197
so she decides to take them down with help from
Terra, Volkana, and Te Fae. She acts out in

483
00:43:17,257 --> 00:43:22,360
public at a children's beauty pageant she's
hosting, purposely angering the Jons, who then

484
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:28,623
morph into one giant person and try to destroy
Ivy. Ivy and her mentees use their combined

485
00:43:28,663 --> 00:43:34,387
abilities to defeat and kill the Jons. The Joker
later arrives at the Legion of Doom, announcing

486
00:43:34,427 --> 00:43:39,429
his return to villainy and claiming that he
is Nightwing's killer, much to Barbara's anger.

487
00:43:40,002 --> 00:43:44,665
While the Legionnaires cheer on the Joker, a
shocked Harley notices an alternate version

488
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:50,709
of herself winking at her from the crowd, leading
her to believe she's going insane. So is the

489
00:43:50,749 --> 00:43:56,493
assumption here that Harley took Nightwing's
tracker to the Legion of Doom, I guess just

490
00:43:56,533 --> 00:44:01,096
hanging around? I think the assumption here
is that Nightwing was tracking Poison Ivy,

491
00:44:01,557 --> 00:44:06,040
which he did while Poison Ivy was on that one
talk show. But then why would he have left

492
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,130
the tracker there and then go up to the mountains?
because he was also following Carly. Okay.

493
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:14,894
All right. That makes more sense now. That's
just a guess. I'm not entirely sure. It's a

494
00:44:14,934 --> 00:44:19,797
little confusing. Again, I don't really care
for anything they did on the show in reference

495
00:44:19,897 --> 00:44:25,461
to the whole sleepwalking and sleep eviling
habit. Yeah, the fact that her doppelganger

496
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:31,165
was created from one of her hairs and a potato
was kind of strange. Random. So unbelievably

497
00:44:31,205 --> 00:44:35,968
random and not a good payoff at all, I would
say, if they were trying to make me believe

498
00:44:36,008 --> 00:44:40,159
that Harley Quinn was going insane. I thought
the show very much dropped the ball in that

499
00:44:40,199 --> 00:44:44,621
regard, because at no point did I think that
Harley was going insane. Even when she saw

500
00:44:44,661 --> 00:44:48,703
the doppelganger of herself, I was like, I don't
know, Clayface, there's so many people that

501
00:44:48,723 --> 00:44:55,207
can impersonate Harley Quinn. Episode 7 was
titled the most culturally impactful film franchise

502
00:44:55,527 --> 00:45:03,331
of all time, which we learn is apparently Avatar.
Well, Batgirl exposes the Joker for lying about

503
00:45:03,371 --> 00:45:10,752
killing Nightwing on Dr. Psycho's podcast, Harley
and Ivy use a time sphere to visit their future

504
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:17,277
selves for advice. They arrive in a post-apocalyptic
Gotham in 2048, where they learn a mysterious

505
00:45:17,337 --> 00:45:24,523
force destroyed the city in 2024, and an adult
Robin rules as a tyrant. Harley and Ivy meet

506
00:45:24,603 --> 00:45:29,927
their future daughter, Naityri, who betrays
them to Robin. Naityri reveals that Harley

507
00:45:29,947 --> 00:45:34,371
and Ivy were bad parents and a bad couple due
to their lack of communication.

508
00:45:37,694 --> 00:45:42,236
and escape with the help of one of King Shark's
adult children. They accidentally return to

509
00:45:42,256 --> 00:45:47,459
the present six days after they first traveled
to the past, only to learn that in their absence,

510
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:53,202
the apocalypse began a year early. This episode
felt sort of like the Las Vegas episode to

511
00:45:53,242 --> 00:45:58,045
me in that it's kind of fillery. I'm not sure
they needed to take this whole approach that

512
00:45:58,065 --> 00:46:01,967
they did with them traveling to the future,
considering it never really played a part later

513
00:46:02,047 --> 00:46:06,689
on this season. No, it was just for the gags,
I think, but I thought the gags were pretty

514
00:46:06,729 --> 00:46:11,531
funny. I'm wondering how Poison Ivy and Harley
Quinn could have a kid. I'm assuming through

515
00:46:11,691 --> 00:46:16,293
cloning, I guess, put their DNA together and
then come out with a kid that way. But the

516
00:46:16,413 --> 00:46:22,095
concept of Naetiria, I thought, was pretty solid
and I love their reaction to their daughter.

517
00:46:22,276 --> 00:46:26,097
Yeah, the funniest part of this episode to me
was Robin, the way he was just like controlling

518
00:46:26,137 --> 00:46:29,939
everything from a video game. I thought that
was great. And he turned out to be this like

519
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:33,960
bearded guy who couldn't even stand anymore
because he's so used to sitting in his chair.

520
00:46:37,238 --> 00:46:42,079
While Harley and Ivy were in the future, Bane
travels to Italy to fix the Legion of Doom's

521
00:46:42,139 --> 00:46:47,721
pasta maker for Nora. After discovering that
the model is discontinued, he learns how to

522
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:53,202
make pasta from an elderly and abusive Italian
woman. Luther plans to thicken the ozone layer

523
00:46:53,242 --> 00:46:58,784
with a laser from his moon base, but needs Volcano's
powers to activate volcanoes and expand Earth's

524
00:46:58,924 --> 00:47:04,385
ozone for his plan to work. Nora refuses to
let Luther abuse his power while Ivy is away,

525
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:10,072
so Luthor traps her and the others in the Legion
of Doom's headquarters. They escape by blowing

526
00:47:10,152 --> 00:47:14,795
up the headquarters, which gives Luthor the
ozone range he needs to use his laser to block

527
00:47:14,835 --> 00:47:21,398
the sun, causing chaos. Harley and Ivy realize
upon their return that Luthor's goal was to

528
00:47:21,438 --> 00:47:27,422
weaken Superman. I do love how they managed
to take what was kind of a really dumb element

529
00:47:27,462 --> 00:47:32,745
from Season 3 with Bane and the whole pasta
maker thing, and turn it into a pretty awesome

530
00:47:32,845 --> 00:47:38,276
gag for this season. You know what? I think
we both complained about Bane's story arc from

531
00:47:38,317 --> 00:47:44,461
season three, but love how they just doubled
down on it by actually making him go to Italy

532
00:47:44,682 --> 00:47:49,726
and learn how to make pasta. It was actually
hilarious. It was great. It was super funny.

533
00:47:49,786 --> 00:47:54,349
I thought the whole grandmother stabbing him
and then like teaching him how to cook and

534
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:58,653
then being like, you're going to stay here forever.
It was such a great arc and great storyline

535
00:47:58,673 --> 00:48:03,584
this episode. Who would have thought when the
pasta maker subplot was introduced at the very

536
00:48:03,604 --> 00:48:08,426
end of season two that it would have such a
great payoff in season four? No one would have

537
00:48:08,446 --> 00:48:15,350
guessed that. Nah. I also loved all the stuff
with Nora this episode, like between her and

538
00:48:15,550 --> 00:48:20,453
Captain Cold. I thought it was just hilarious
how they're just trying to get together and

539
00:48:20,493 --> 00:48:25,416
all this other stuff keeps happening. Rachel
Trash again was just phenomenal as the character

540
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:32,260
of Nora. Moving on to episode nine. It was titled
Potato-Based Cloning Incident. Harley and Ivy

541
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:37,263
discover that Harley has a clone, unknowingly
created by Gordon, with the Legion of Doom's

542
00:48:37,303 --> 00:48:43,207
cloning device slash microwave. Potato Harley
suggests Ivy use her Lexcorp board membership

543
00:48:43,347 --> 00:48:48,990
to vote Luther out so they can legally turn
off his ozone laser. To secure the last vote,

544
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:55,630
Ivy organizes a golf tournament to sway an influential
board member, but accidentally kills him. Nonetheless,

545
00:48:55,790 --> 00:49:01,493
his wife votes against Lex Luthor because Harley
had previously saved her life, allowing Ivy

546
00:49:01,553 --> 00:49:07,515
to shut down Luthor's machine. Meanwhile, Potato
Harley reveals that she witnessed Harley killing

547
00:49:07,575 --> 00:49:12,758
Nightwing during one of her sleepwalking episodes,
which Dr. Psycho confirms by entering Harley's

548
00:49:12,838 --> 00:49:18,320
memory. Though with Flash's help with time travel,
Harley prevents Psycho from remembering and

549
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:24,307
exposing her as the killer on his podcast. Potato
Harley attempts to arrest the real Harley along

550
00:49:24,327 --> 00:49:29,329
with other people whom she considers criminals
for minor infractions, leading Harley to fight

551
00:49:29,429 --> 00:49:34,912
and destroy her clone. Ashamed of her actions
and realizing her failure as a hero, Harley

552
00:49:34,952 --> 00:49:39,974
announces to Batgirl she is quitting the Bat
family before the Joker shoots Batgirl in the

553
00:49:40,034 --> 00:49:45,877
spine in order to rebuild his reputation. I
do love the different ways sometimes this show

554
00:49:45,977 --> 00:49:50,879
will reinterpret comic canon like the Joker
shooting Batgirl. I thought this was a perfect

555
00:49:50,959 --> 00:49:54,780
and shocking moment to do that. Yeah, for sure.
When they did that, I was like, oh, this is

556
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,701
the killing joke. And it made sense, like, why
he would do that because his reputation was

557
00:49:58,741 --> 00:50:03,062
destroyed. So he was like, I got to take out
a member of the Bat family somehow. Yeah. This

558
00:50:03,102 --> 00:50:08,124
episode was really the pinnacle of Harley's
arc. It ended a little bit early, which I thought

559
00:50:08,144 --> 00:50:12,965
was interesting, when she realized that she
really wasn't cut out to be a hero and was

560
00:50:13,005 --> 00:50:19,028
too guilty to continue either way. Again, I
don't love Potato Harley and I don't really

561
00:50:19,268 --> 00:50:24,851
love the fact that Harley learned she was able
to be a hero because of Potato Harley. I think

562
00:50:24,871 --> 00:50:28,874
there was a different way the writers could
have done it. It's just so unbelievably random

563
00:50:28,974 --> 00:50:33,096
that they went this direction. I did think it
was funny that her first line after Potato

564
00:50:33,116 --> 00:50:39,420
Harley died was, she killed Nightwing. Yeah,
yeah, I can't wait to see the repercussions

565
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:44,826
of her line to Batgirl in the next season. Episode
10 was titled Killer's Block, and this episode

566
00:50:44,846 --> 00:50:50,468
was actually dedicated to Arlene Sorkin, who
was the inspiration for Harley Quinn due to

567
00:50:50,528 --> 00:50:55,470
a Harley Quinn performance that she gave while
she was cast on the Days of Our Lives. I thought

568
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:59,491
that was pretty cool that they did that. In
the episode, Harley is conflicted when she

569
00:50:59,531 --> 00:51:04,752
can't break herself to kill the Joker for paralyzing
Batgirl, and she later joins Poison Ivy on

570
00:51:04,792 --> 00:51:10,050
the moon for Lex Luthor's birthday party, which
Ivy plans to ruin. They learn however that

571
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:15,953
Luthor has captured Superman and weakened him,
creating a suit that mimics his powers. After

572
00:51:15,993 --> 00:51:21,616
getting into a brawl with Luthor, Ivy is easily
defeated by him. Embarrassed and realizing

573
00:51:21,636 --> 00:51:26,699
that her business partners are not interested
in making a change, Ivy quits her job and teams

574
00:51:26,759 --> 00:51:32,162
up with Harley and Batgirl to use Luthor's laser
to destroy their businesses, blowing up the

575
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:38,474
earth bases of LexCorp, Wayne Enterprises, Veronica
Kale's company, and the Legion of Doom. Just

576
00:51:38,514 --> 00:51:43,878
before the moon cracks in half from the overloaded
laser, Steppenwolf sends Luther to Apocalypse

577
00:51:43,958 --> 00:51:49,482
as punishment for harming Ivy, and Harley saves
Superman, having finally accepted both her

578
00:51:49,522 --> 00:51:54,786
good and bad qualities. Three days later, with
Superman regaining his powers restoring the

579
00:51:54,846 --> 00:52:00,310
moon, Bruce Wayne is released from prison and
becomes Batman once again. Harley and Ivy then

580
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:06,730
form a new team with Barbara Gordon and Catwoman
called the Gotham City After discovering that

581
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:11,814
Nightwing's grave has been robbed, they decide
that they will investigate the case, unaware

582
00:52:11,894 --> 00:52:17,638
that Talia Al Ghul has taken the corpse and
have resurrected Nightwing in a Lazarus pit.

583
00:52:17,698 --> 00:52:22,941
I thought this was a solid final episode. I
like how the show adapted the idea of Lex's

584
00:52:23,001 --> 00:52:30,394
battle suit into a means of specifically recreating
Superman's powers. Yeah, that's actually from

585
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:34,917
the comics. You know, there was a time when
Lex Luthor attempted to be a more superior

586
00:52:35,017 --> 00:52:39,360
Superman and showed up, even like stole his
logo and everything like that. So, yeah, this

587
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:45,083
was an interesting interpretation of that. I
agree. I loved this episode. I loved the fight

588
00:52:45,103 --> 00:52:50,927
scene between Ivy and Lex. I love how Ivy destroyed
like all of those different companies on Earth.

589
00:52:51,347 --> 00:52:55,189
And I love how Harley saved Superman. I thought
that was pretty interesting. Yeah, it kind

590
00:52:55,229 --> 00:53:00,163
of felt like. Poison Ivy's arc was going to
be anti-climactic, just losing to Lex in the

591
00:53:00,183 --> 00:53:04,205
way that she did, but there was something very
cathartic and satisfying when she just said

592
00:53:04,285 --> 00:53:07,927
fuck it and started blowing up all of her enemies'
shit. I mean it's not the most clever way to

593
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:13,049
culminate an arc, but there's something still
satisfying about how she did it. I thought

594
00:53:13,069 --> 00:53:17,691
it was clever, actually. I didn't see it coming,
at least. But you know, Ivy's smart enough

595
00:53:17,711 --> 00:53:23,133
to be able to retool a device like that to be
a weapon. Again, I'm excited for the Gotham

596
00:53:23,153 --> 00:53:27,503
City Sirens. I wasn't sure that they were ever
going to go in that direction with the show

597
00:53:28,024 --> 00:53:32,206
and it looks like they are. Season five is not
going to come soon enough, I can tell you that.

598
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:35,968
Yeah, it's gonna be great. I initially thought
they were going the birds of prey route, so

599
00:53:36,048 --> 00:53:39,950
I thought it was funny when, you know, they
kind of subverted that with the Gotham City

600
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:43,012
sirens. I was like, okay, that makes sense because
that's a little bit more true considering the

601
00:53:43,032 --> 00:53:46,854
team members. But then Barbara Gordon brought
up, or we could call ourselves the birds of

602
00:53:46,874 --> 00:53:50,876
prey. And they're like, no, like we have nothing
to do with birds. Like, why would we do that?

603
00:53:51,356 --> 00:53:57,417
None of us are even bird themed. Yeah. That
was funny though, because to my knowledge,

604
00:53:57,777 --> 00:54:01,681
I think all of, if not most of those characters
were actually also part of the Birds of Prey

605
00:54:01,701 --> 00:54:07,826
in the comics too. I don't think Poison Ivy
was, but yes, Catwoman and Harley Quinn, I

606
00:54:07,846 --> 00:54:12,450
believe, have both been members. In addition
to Batgirl. Right, right. She founded the team.

607
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:16,913
But that does it for all the episodes. I thought
it ended on a really high note. I don't think

608
00:54:16,934 --> 00:54:22,418
it was as strong as past seasons. I don't think
it was as heartfelt as prior seasons. but the

609
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:28,082
series' fantastic voice talent and irreverent
raunchy humor just continues to make this DC's

610
00:54:28,402 --> 00:54:33,166
greatest guilty pleasure. I'm giving it three
and a half stars, just one notch down from

611
00:54:33,226 --> 00:54:39,530
season three, but still a fresh rating on Rotten
Tomatoes. Yeah, I agree. I think it was an

612
00:54:39,571 --> 00:54:45,455
enjoyable season, maybe just a small notch below
previous entries for the series, but still

613
00:54:45,475 --> 00:54:51,390
a solid entry for DC television, and hopefully
we get more. Yeah, I'm absolutely looking forward

614
00:54:51,431 --> 00:54:55,593
to more. I feel like if the show got canceled,
there would be like a sore lack of dick jokes

615
00:54:55,813 --> 00:55:00,535
just out there in the world. The show kind of
fills that kind of like dick joke niche. 100

616
00:55:00,816 --> 00:55:05,498
percent. I definitely agree with that. It would
definitely be missed if and when it ever gets

617
00:55:05,538 --> 00:55:09,941
canceled, which I think the show is pretty popular,
so hopefully it doesn't. But that does it for

628
00:56:02,298 --> 00:56:07,241
our executive producer meeting is this weekend
in which we'll determine the next month's content.

629
00:56:07,581 --> 00:56:12,985
We do know that Dynamic Duel is gonna go full
on Halloween mode for the entire month of October.

630
00:56:13,538 --> 00:56:19,106
So we're thinking maybe your next episode is
gonna be like vampire characters or demon type

631
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:23,673
characters, something Halloween-ish. Yeah, I'm
excited for Halloween this year. It's gonna

632
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:28,795
be awesome. So look forward to next week's episode.
