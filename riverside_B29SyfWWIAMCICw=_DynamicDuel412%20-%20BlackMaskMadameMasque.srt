10
00:01:10,314 --> 00:01:15,737
Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we
review superhero films and debate the superiority

11
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:21,701
between Marvel and DC by comparing their characters
and stat-based battle simulations. I'm Johnny

12
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:28,026
DC. And I'm his twin brother Marvelous Joe.
And in this episode, we are doing a duel between

13
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:33,209
the Batman street level mobster villain Black
Mask and the high tech mafia queen, Madame

14
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:37,512
Mask from Marvel. Yeah, she's primarily an Iron
Man villain, but she's also been a prominent

15
00:01:37,532 --> 00:01:43,012
villain for like Kate Bishop Hawkeye. Of course,
the stool is a tie-in to the Penguin review

16
00:01:43,032 --> 00:01:48,295
that we did last week, because Black Mask is
a Batman villain that fits into that crime

17
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:52,138
mobster type world. That's right. And we're
going to find out who's going to win between

18
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:55,600
those two characters later on in this episode.
Before that, we're going to break down the

19
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,464
comic book movie news from the past week, of
which there was finally some DC news. We learned

20
00:02:00,524 --> 00:02:07,809
that a Sergeant Rock film is in development
with Luca Guadagnino and Daniel Craig. You

21
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:13,508
son of a bitch. James Bond himself! You'd love
to see it! All these Bond actors working for

22
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:17,510
DC, I just don't understand it, but we'll talk
about it later on. I guess I can't really call

23
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:23,253
you a son of a bitch without Diss and Mom, so...
Yeah. I retract that last statement. Yay, you!

24
00:02:23,273 --> 00:02:28,476
Love you, Mom! As always, guys, we list our
segment times in our episode description, so

Pip pip cheerio. Thanks, AJ and NK. And thanks

35
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:29,394
to everyone who supports the podcast. And especially
thank you to not only. patrons and executive

36
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:33,777
producers of the show, but also members of the
DynaMic Podcast Network, another set of awesome

37
00:03:33,857 --> 00:03:39,620
twins, Scott and Gil Camacho. It was their birthday
this past week. Happy birthday, guys. Gil,

38
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,882
if I could get you any gift from Marvel for
your birthday, I would get you a gamma bomb

39
00:03:43,902 --> 00:03:49,105
because you could use it to get the powers of
the Hulk and then you'd be frigging the Hulk.

40
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:54,068
So yeah, that'd be awesome. Wait, you're saying
you want to blow him up? What? No, no, no.

41
00:03:54,528 --> 00:03:57,950
You just get bombarded by the radiation. You
know how it goes. You know how it goes. Damn,

42
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:03,755
tell Gilly how you really feel. No, it's fine.
He just has to detonate it from a safe distance.

43
00:04:04,296 --> 00:04:11,043
Okay, sure. And I will get Scotty, the DC fan,
and the superior twin, the Batcave. Specifically,

44
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:15,447
the trophy room area for you to store all of
your cool collectible stuff. Yeah, that's not

45
00:04:15,487 --> 00:04:20,192
as cool as Hulk powers, so I think Gilly won
out here. It's cooler than being blown up by

46
00:04:20,232 --> 00:04:27,360
a bomb. Ha ha ha. Thanks, Gillie and Scotty,
so much for being as cool as you are, and again,

47
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:32,164
happy birthday. But speaking of Scotty and Gillie,
be sure to tune in to their show on the DynaMic

48
00:04:32,204 --> 00:04:37,148
podcast network, Max Destruction, which pits
your favorite action heroes from film and television

49
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:42,313
against each other. Both hosts are taking a
short break for the holidays, so this is the

50
00:04:42,373 --> 00:04:47,137
perfect time to get caught up on their back
catalog of episodes if you've missed any. On

51
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:51,861
the Senjou World podcast, host Zachary Hepburn
speculates on fights between fan favorite anime

52
00:04:51,881 --> 00:04:57,211
and manga characters. Zach is back with an all
new episode this week. He's going to pick Kaido,

53
00:04:57,251 --> 00:05:03,452
the king of beasts from One Piece against AcnoLogia,
the dragon king from Fairy Tale. And on the

54
00:05:03,492 --> 00:05:09,114
console, combat podcast hosts John and Dean
simile battles between popular video game characters.

55
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:14,816
In yesterday's episode, they found out who would
win between Astro Bot and Sackboy from Little

56
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:19,737
Big Planet. Visit dynamicpodcasts.com or click

But with that out of the way, quick to the

58
00:05:24,438 --> 00:05:30,680
No Prize! A No Prize is an award Marvel used
to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic

59
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,081
Duel No Prize, is a digital award we post on
Instagram for the person that we feel gave

60
00:05:35,121 --> 00:05:39,802
the best answer to our question of the week.
Last week, we asked you guys, what has been

61
00:05:39,842 --> 00:05:45,684
your favorite animated Marvel or DC project
of all time and why? And this was coming off

62
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:50,825
of the first official trailer that we got for
What If Season 3, which is coming out in just

63
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:55,147
a few weeks. We got a lot of great answers and
actually a lot of people gave the same answer.

64
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:59,909
So it was really hard to pick winners this time
around, but we have three honorable mentions

65
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:06,191
as well as the no prize winner. Our first honorable
mention goes to Cyrus Moore who said, Hey guys,

66
00:06:06,251 --> 00:06:12,174
Cyrus Moore here. My favorite animated show
of all time will always be Young Justice. I

67
00:06:12,234 --> 00:06:19,437
grew up as a kid watching it all the time, very
religiously, the action in it's phenomenal.

68
00:06:19,457 --> 00:06:25,701
The storylines phenomenal. the romance between
Miss Martian and Superboy, just everything

69
00:06:25,741 --> 00:06:30,626
about that TV show is captivating. It's got
something for everybody and everybody should

70
00:06:30,646 --> 00:06:35,530
love that show. Yeah, Young Justice, it's a
fantastic show. All of the seasons have just

71
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,494
gotten better one after the other. The world
building that they do in this show as its own

72
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:46,980
Young Justice universe is phenomenal and totally
ranks right up there with other large ensemble

73
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,010
shows like Justice League. Yeah, apparently
Young Justice is so good that two other people

74
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,232
gave the same answer, including Scott Camacho
and Mickey Mantlingian. Apparently I need to

75
00:06:57,272 --> 00:07:02,233
start watching Young Justice. Yeah, we've never
reviewed it on this show because the episode

76
00:07:02,273 --> 00:07:07,695
count and the seasons are so long and it hasn't
consistently been released on any platform,

77
00:07:08,175 --> 00:07:12,876
but maybe if they make another season we will.
We'll see. Great answer, Cyrus. Our next honorable

78
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:21,263
mention goes to Mason Thompson. Who said? Hey
guys, I think. My favorite animated project

79
00:07:21,303 --> 00:07:27,806
from Marvel DC is gonna have to be Batman Beyond
because I think they just took so many cool

80
00:07:27,846 --> 00:07:34,529
concepts With like future Batman villains. It
was just awesome. I think that it was ahead

81
00:07:34,549 --> 00:07:40,791
of its time literally Get it get it. Alright.
See ya. The whispering notwithstanding Batman

82
00:07:40,831 --> 00:07:44,133
Beyond is a great answer. Yeah, I feel like
we're being trolled with the whispering by

83
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:51,407
this point I loved Batman Beyond. I still remember
as a kid watching the premiere of that show

84
00:07:51,767 --> 00:07:56,008
and just loving everything about it. I thought
it was the coolest show that had ever been

85
00:07:56,048 --> 00:08:01,690
made. And it may have been, in fact. In terms
of just cool factor, yeah, I would have to

86
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:07,272
agree with you. It was such a cool concept.
Like this super high-tech futuristic Batman

87
00:08:07,672 --> 00:08:14,510
as a young guy but still being able to fit Bruce
Wayne into the story, like every episode. There

88
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:20,196
are a lot of future versions of Batman, like
the Dark Knight, but Batman Beyond may be my

89
00:08:20,236 --> 00:08:25,823
favorite. Yeah, we did a duel episode with Batman
Beyond against Spider-Man 2099, so if you're

90
00:08:25,843 --> 00:08:29,647
interested in those characters, definitely check
out that duel episode, because that was a lot

91
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:34,833
of fun. Great answer, Mason Thompson. Our next
honorable mention goes to Travis Herndon, who

92
00:08:34,873 --> 00:08:39,539
said... What's up Dynamin' Dudes, Travis here,
shout out to my Able Twins. So my answer would

93
00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:46,281
have to be the Hope vs Wolverine animated movie.
I think that movie was cool, it was bloody,

94
00:08:46,421 --> 00:08:52,123
it had a badass fight between these two legendary
characters. Nolan North as Deadpool was awesome,

95
00:08:52,623 --> 00:08:58,965
and honestly, I'm hoping that we get something
like this within the MCU one day between Wolverine

96
00:08:59,045 --> 00:09:05,275
and the more savage Hulk. Yet we nearly reviewed
Hulk vs. and lead up to the Deadpool and Wolverine

97
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:10,278
movie that came out during the summer because
of course the Hulk vs. famously has a Deadpool

98
00:09:10,298 --> 00:09:16,420
vs. Wolverine fight scene in addition to Hulk
vs. Wolverine and also packaged with that film

99
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,442
if you can find that film anywhere in cheese
is Thor vs. Hulk. I think the only reason we

100
00:09:21,542 --> 00:09:27,585
didn't end up reviewing Hulk vs. was because
it was not easily findable outside of the Blu-ray

101
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:32,976
or DVD media. Yeah, I've never seen Hulk versus
I've heard great things, but the fact that

102
00:09:33,016 --> 00:09:38,399
Marvel can't respect their own characters and
projects enough to have available for streamers

103
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:43,422
on any kind of streaming platform just shows
you how sucky Marvel is. Well, you would think

104
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:48,224
it would be on Disney Plus, right? But it's
not. I wonder why. I think because Universal

105
00:09:48,284 --> 00:09:53,908
co-owns the film rights to the Hulk, so that
might be it. Or at least they did, but it might

106
00:09:53,928 --> 00:09:58,158
have something to do with that. Gotcha, that
actually makes a lot of sense. We want to give

107
00:09:58,178 --> 00:10:03,159
a quick shout out to Peter Troll, who gave the
answer of Spectacular Spider-Man and to Colby

108
00:10:03,199 --> 00:10:08,941
Hentges and Gil Camacho, who both answered with
X-Men, the animated series and X-Men 97. But

109
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:16,323
the winner of this week's No Prize is Mike Williams,
who said, Best animated DC would have to be

110
00:10:16,843 --> 00:10:22,965
Justice League and Justice League Unlimited.
Great stories and great way to inculcate other

111
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:29,207
characters. As far as Marvel, I would have to
go with X-Men and X-Men 97. Really like the

112
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:34,310
animation drawings and the storylines they presented
there. And as always, make mine Marvel. Take

113
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:41,013
care. Yeah, Justice League Unlimited is like
peak Bruce Tim universe. It introduced us to

114
00:10:41,153 --> 00:10:46,236
so many characters that a lot of the public
isn't familiar with, but as comic fans, I just

115
00:10:46,376 --> 00:10:51,179
loved seeing all of them. It was a great episodic
series as well, in the same vein as the Saturday

116
00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:55,061
morning cartoons that we would watch as a kid.
It was tailor-made for the audience, and like

117
00:10:55,081 --> 00:11:00,295
the true successor, of a show like Super Friends
that a previous generation grew up watching.

118
00:11:00,915 --> 00:11:05,097
Yeah, and he also mentioned X-Men the Animated
Series and X-Men 97. It goes without saying

119
00:11:05,357 --> 00:11:10,539
that series is probably the best superhero animated
show of all time. You know, we had two other

120
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:15,080
people give the answer of X-Men 97, and like
we gave that season five stars out of five.

121
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,701
It's like the quintessential X-Men experience.
So you could do no wrong with that answer.

122
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:23,831
Where Michael Williams went right in terms of
this week's No Prize win was that he packaged

123
00:11:23,872 --> 00:11:29,334
together Justice League and X-Men, which were
probably the paragons of each universe's respective

124
00:11:29,614 --> 00:11:34,836
animated series. At least for 90s kids like
us, you know? Yeah, absolutely. Great answer,

125
00:11:34,876 --> 00:11:38,758
Michael Williams. You win this week's No Prize.
If you the listener want a shot at winning

126
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:43,820
your own No Prize, stay tuned to later on in
this episode when we'll be asking another Question

127
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,741
of the Week. Another That's Done? On to the
news!

128
00:11:52,106 --> 00:11:58,070
Alright, in a bit of news that I swore we've
talked about before, filmmaker Luca Guadagnino

129
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:04,274
is developing a Sergeant Rock film with Daniel
Craig, who will potentially play the lead character.

130
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:09,458
If you're not familiar with Luca Guadagnino,
he's an amazing director. He's directed films

131
00:12:09,498 --> 00:12:15,202
such as Call Me By Your Name, Suspiria, Bones
and All, Challengers, and the upcoming queer

132
00:12:15,222 --> 00:12:20,378
film, which also stars Daniel Craig. And if
you're not familiar with Daniel Craig... then

133
00:12:20,618 --> 00:12:27,902
where have you been? Because the guy is fucking
007 James Bond. And if he gets this role of

134
00:12:28,002 --> 00:12:35,307
Sergeant Rock, I will probably never forgive
you, Jonathan. Okay, I'm fine with that. You

135
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:39,969
stole Timothy Dalton, he was the chief in the
Doom Patrol series, he was a fantastic chief.

136
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,093
You stole Pierce Brosnan, who was Dr. Fate in
the Black Adam movie. You're damn right. You

137
00:12:45,113 --> 00:12:50,783
had Sean Connery. in the League of Extraordinary
Gentlemen movie, which was actually a DC imprint.

138
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:55,384
Yeah, that's correct. So you've had all these
tremendous Bond actors play DC roles. Zero

139
00:12:55,404 --> 00:13:00,505
Bond actors have played a Marvel role so far.
And if you have listened to this podcast for

140
00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:06,227
a while, you know that in addition to me being
a Marvel fan, I'm also a huge James Bond fan.

141
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:11,928
So like if Daniel Craig becomes Sergeant Rock
and this movie is as amazing as it sounds,

142
00:13:12,448 --> 00:13:16,589
like it's like Saving Private Ryan with Sergeant
Rock and Daniel Craig or something like that.

143
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:23,390
I'm going to end this podcast and probably never
talk to you again. I kind of consider Adam

144
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:29,454
West to be the American Roger Moore because
they look like brothers. So there's that. Well,

145
00:13:29,494 --> 00:13:33,497
Roger Moore, unfortunately, never got a chance
to play either a Marvel or DC character, but

146
00:13:33,937 --> 00:13:37,179
I'd like to think that he would have played
a Marvel character if he got a chance to. Well,

147
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:41,782
the odds are against you, my friend, because
apparently all the James Bond guys like DC.

148
00:13:41,943 --> 00:13:48,639
Now, no deal has been signed between Luca and
DC Studios. James Gunn and Peter Safran, so

149
00:13:48,699 --> 00:13:54,182
it's not official, but because it's being reported
by the trades, odds are more than likely that

150
00:13:54,262 --> 00:13:59,385
it will be happening. The film apparently already
has a script written by the same screenwriter

151
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:05,568
who wrote Challengers and Queer for Luca Guadagnino.
Do you think Daniel Craig would make a good

152
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:10,150
Sergeant Rock? Yeah, I think he'll make a fine
Sergeant Rock. Sergeant Rock is a World War

153
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:16,458
II character in DC Comics, so essentially this
film would just be a war movie. There have

154
00:14:16,478 --> 00:14:21,801
been other adaptations of Sgt. Rock, like the
animated short where he led the creature commandos.

155
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:27,064
So I don't know if they would tie that into
this film in any way. I imagine not. It may

156
00:14:27,084 --> 00:14:31,587
just be a really solid World War II movie. And
I'll take it. I wish Marvel would do something

157
00:14:31,627 --> 00:14:35,369
like that. Well, I guess we had Captain America
the First Avenger. That was a World War II

158
00:14:35,389 --> 00:14:41,793
movie. But not like in a realistic, gritty sense.
It was very much in like a diesel punk, fantastical

159
00:14:41,973 --> 00:14:45,378
type of World War II setting. Yeah, I don't
think this would be anything like that. It's

160
00:14:45,398 --> 00:14:49,459
definitely not Lucas Highbrow style, but because
of that, it makes me really look forward to

161
00:14:49,499 --> 00:14:54,000
see what he could do with the World War II movie.
It just sounds like it would be very rated

162
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:59,742
R. Probably the most rated R war movie ever
made. Next to like Inglorious Basterds or something

163
00:14:59,762 --> 00:15:06,184
like that. I also hope it really happens because
Daniel Craig is attached to it and because

164
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:10,605
he played James Bond and because I know that
would break your heart. That would be funny

165
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:16,961
to me. If it happens. I will immediately rip
my clothes, fall down onto my knees, and fly

166
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:23,406
the stars. I swear. What? I don't know, like,
where that was going. I was going for, like,

167
00:15:23,426 --> 00:15:28,350
a real dramatic type feeling, but yeah, you
took that in a different direction. Anyway,

168
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:32,633
the news about Daniel Craig potentially becoming
Sergeant Rock brings us to our question of

169
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:32,953
the week.

170
00:15:37,462 --> 00:15:43,704
What Marvel character would you cast former
007 actor George Lazenby as and why? Now, George

171
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:49,787
Lazenby is the only other 007 actor that's alive
that has yet to play a Marvel or DC movie.

172
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:54,790
He was only in one James Bond film and that
was On Her Majesty's Secret Service. But, if

173
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:59,492
you take a look at the guy, think about what
Marvel role he could play, and then my goal

174
00:15:59,532 --> 00:16:04,138
is to start campaigning Marvel to hire George
Lazenby as that character. So think about it

Be sure to answer before December 7th. You

180
00:16:24,964 --> 00:16:30,825
guys have two weeks for this one, because Jonathan
and I are recording the next episode early.

181
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:33,384
due to the holidays and some business travel.

182
00:16:40,622 --> 00:16:44,105
That does it for the news for this episode.
So let's go ahead and move on to the main event

183
00:16:44,526 --> 00:16:50,993
where we find out who would win in a match between
Black Mask and Madam Mask.

184
00:17:06,306 --> 00:17:11,688
Okay, Black Mask versus Meta Mask. As we mentioned
earlier, these are two mobster characters who

185
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:19,291
both literally wear masks. Black Mask wears
a ebony black skull mask carved from the coffin

186
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:26,734
of his father, which is badass. And Meta Mask
wears just a plain boring ass gold mask. I

187
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:31,556
would not describe it as boring. It's pretty
badass. It's made out of gold. It's featureless,

188
00:17:31,616 --> 00:17:36,997
except for her eyes. You know, it's really mysterious
and totally awesome. Yeah, I see that and I'm

189
00:17:37,037 --> 00:17:43,052
not scared. I see black mask and I'm shitting
myself. Well, you just have a poor constitution

190
00:17:43,072 --> 00:17:50,195
then and probably irritable bowel syndrome.
Of course, Block Mask has been in a movie.

191
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:54,597
He was the main antagonist in Harley Quinn and
the Birds of Prey, or I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

192
00:17:54,917 --> 00:18:01,079
Birds of Prey and the fantibulous emancipation
of one Harley Quinn. Oh God. Madame Masque has

193
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:06,481
not been in a Marvel movie, but the version
of the character, Whitney Frost, was in Agent

194
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:12,024
Carter season two. Oh, I didn't know that. Did
she wear a gold mask? No, which is why it was

195
00:18:12,044 --> 00:18:16,990
kind of a lame adaptation. Dumb. Well, hopefully
we do the character justice here. But before

196
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:21,452
we get into our match to explain the methodology
behind our duels, let's go to our sentient

197
00:18:21,492 --> 00:18:27,696
duel simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K, tell
our listeners how you go about determining

198
00:18:27,736 --> 00:18:33,399
a winner in our duel matchups. Yes, of course,
sir. The way I determine a winner between the

199
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:39,462
contestants is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations
using the characters statistics. A Monte Carlo

200
00:18:39,502 --> 00:18:43,805
simulation is a probabilistic model used to
determine outcomes through random sampling.

201
00:18:44,225 --> 00:18:49,115
In this case, I randomise the statistics along
a normal distribution as a way to simulate

202
00:18:49,155 --> 00:18:53,736
the many variables that can occur during battle.
The stat parameters are based on the official

203
00:18:53,796 --> 00:18:59,098
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters'
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat

204
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:04,659
categories are included such as range, damage
potential, versatility and perception in order

205
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:10,101
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.
The results of the 1000 simulations provide

206
00:19:10,121 --> 00:19:14,615
a percentage of wins for each character. Contestant
with the higher percentage is declared the

207
00:19:14,675 --> 00:19:19,819
victor as they have a higher probability to
win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,

208
00:19:20,199 --> 00:19:25,002
neither character should win 100% of the matches.
The comic book stories have shown that there's

209
00:19:25,142 --> 00:19:29,945
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so
the confidence rate of my method falls in line

210
00:19:29,965 --> 00:19:34,569
with the precedents that have been established
in the source material. My mathematical simulations

211
00:19:34,609 --> 00:19:39,752
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes

212
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:45,563
tabulated for determination of the winner. Thanks
AJ9K, before we run the simulations though

213
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:49,644
we'd like to break down each character's history
and abilities before improvising a scenario

214
00:19:49,704 --> 00:19:54,506
on how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations
would play out beat for beat. And I believe

215
00:19:54,546 --> 00:20:00,049
it's my turn to go first with the DC characters
backstory, so let me tell you about Black Mask.

216
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:06,471
Now Roman Sionis was born into Gotham City's
wealthy elite, but his privileged life masked

217
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:12,334
deep dysfunction. His parents, obsessed with
maintaining their social standing. showed little

218
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:18,059
genuine affection for their son. This neglect
continued throughout his childhood, with Roman

219
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:23,643
forced to adhere to the same public facade as
his parents. Roman's parents maintained social

220
00:20:23,683 --> 00:20:29,328
ties with the Waynes despite privately resenting
them, and Roman was forced into a friendship

221
00:20:29,388 --> 00:20:34,872
with a young Bruce Wayne. And though Bruce Wayne
was polite and kind, Roman could sense the

222
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:40,017
genuine bond Bruce shared with his parents,
which only amplified Roman's bitterness toward

223
00:20:40,057 --> 00:20:46,338
his own family. Roman masked his jealousy behind
a shallow camaraderie, but deep down he despised

224
00:20:46,378 --> 00:20:51,942
Bruce's seemingly perfect life, seeing it as
a reflection of everything he lacked. Roman

225
00:20:51,982 --> 00:20:58,448
grew to hate the, quote-unquote, masks his parents
wore to conceal their true selves, and he developed

226
00:20:58,508 --> 00:21:05,214
a lifelong fascination with masks as symbols
of identity. As an adult, Roman joined Janus

227
00:21:05,234 --> 00:21:11,490
Cosmetics, his father's company, quickly rising
to vice president. Roman fell in love with

228
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:16,713
a working-class model named Cersei, but his
parents forced him to end the relationship.

229
00:21:17,174 --> 00:21:23,497
Enraged, Roman retaliated by burning down the
family mansion, killing his parents, and inheriting

230
00:21:23,557 --> 00:21:29,441
their fortune. With complete control of Janus
Cosmetics, Roman initially enjoyed success,

231
00:21:29,761 --> 00:21:36,705
but his lack of business acumen led to disaster.
He launched a defective makeup line that disfigured

232
00:21:36,805 --> 00:21:42,629
hundreds of customers. The lawsuits bankrupted
the company and destroyed its reputation. Bruce

233
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:48,214
Wayne, head of Wayne Enterprises, offered a
bailout, but only if Roman relinquished control

234
00:21:48,254 --> 00:21:54,619
of the company. Humiliated, Roman blamed Wayne
for his failures, and in a fit of rage, he

235
00:21:54,719 --> 00:22:00,484
smashed his father's ebony coffin in the Sionis
family crypt and carved a mask from its lid,

236
00:22:00,884 --> 00:22:03,526
transforming himself into Black Mask.

237
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:12,575
for his personal and professional failures.
As Black Mask, Roman established himself as

238
00:22:12,635 --> 00:22:18,397
one of Gotham's most feared crime lords. He
founded the False Face Society, a criminal

239
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:24,599
gang whose members wore distinctive masks, hand-picked
by Roman to reflect their personalities. From

240
00:22:24,639 --> 00:22:29,840
their base in the Sionis family crypt, the False
Face Society launched a crime spree across

241
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:36,295
Gotham, drawing the attention of both law enforcement
and Batman. One of Roman's early crimes involved

242
00:22:36,395 --> 00:22:41,978
targeting Wayne Foundation executives. Using
the toxic cosmetics that had ruined his company,

243
00:22:42,378 --> 00:22:48,922
Black Mask disfigured and killed three executives.
He also kidnapped Cersei, his former fiance,

244
00:22:49,282 --> 00:22:54,885
and forced her to wear a mannequin-like mask
laced with a diluted version of the toxic makeup,

245
00:22:55,325 --> 00:23:01,589
permanently disfiguring her face. To humiliate
her further, Roman made Cersei his unwilling

246
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:07,627
accomplice. After deducing Black Mask's identity,
Batman set a trap to capture him by hosting

247
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:13,209
a masquerade ball at Wayne Manor, knowing Roman
would be unable to resist the opportunity to

248
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:19,731
strike. Roman infiltrated the event with Cersei
as his date and lured Bruce into the conservatory,

249
00:23:19,911 --> 00:23:25,592
intending to kill him. However, Bruce disarmed
Roman, forcing him to flee. Batman and Robin

250
00:23:25,652 --> 00:23:31,302
tracked Black Mask to the Cionis crypt, where
they defeated his gang. Roman escaped through

251
00:23:31,342 --> 00:23:36,204
a hidden passage accessed through the false
bottom of his father's coffin and fled to his

252
00:23:36,264 --> 00:23:42,007
family's rebuilt estate, which he set ablaze
again in an attempt to sever his ties to his

253
00:23:42,067 --> 00:23:47,969
former identity. During a confrontation with
Batman, Roman fell face-first into the flames,

254
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:55,233
refusing the ebony mask to his face. Severely
disfigured but alive, Roman was apprehended

255
00:23:55,333 --> 00:24:00,803
and sent to Arkham Asylum. Roman eventually
escaped Arkham and resumed his criminal activities.

256
00:24:01,123 --> 00:24:06,325
He reassembled the False Face Society and began
a series of arsons targeting Wayne Enterprise

257
00:24:06,385 --> 00:24:12,628
properties. Batman infiltrated the gang under
the alias Skull Face, posing as a new recruit.

258
00:24:13,008 --> 00:24:19,131
Roman, impressed by Skull Face's skills, tasked
him with assisting in various crimes. However,

259
00:24:19,151 --> 00:24:25,073
when Lucius Fox was kidnapped, Batman revealed
his true identity and rescued Fox, though Black

260
00:24:25,113 --> 00:24:30,596
Mask escaped. Roman's vendetta against Wayne
and Batman continued, driving his gang to more

261
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:36,460
audacious crimes. During the No Man's Land crisis
when Gotham City was devastated by an earthquake

262
00:24:36,801 --> 00:24:42,625
and declared uninhabitable, Roman seized control
of the Fashion District and rebranded his gang

263
00:24:42,985 --> 00:24:50,110
as the True-Facers, a nihilistic cult. Rejecting
wealth and power, Roman embraced a philosophy

264
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:56,910
of destruction, claiming Gotham's devastation
revealed its quote-unquote true face. The true-facers

265
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:03,273
disfigured themselves and their victims, spreading
terror through the ruined city. Roman targeted

266
00:25:03,393 --> 00:25:08,855
Oracle's clock tower, planning to dismantle
the remnants of organized resistance. However,

267
00:25:08,935 --> 00:25:14,498
Batgirl intervened, breaking Roman's arm and
dismantling his cult. Roman was subsequently

268
00:25:14,538 --> 00:25:20,400
imprisoned in Blackgate Penitentiary. After
Gotham's reconstruction, Roman resurfaced during

269
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:26,800
a Gotham gang war known as the War Games. Exploiting
a gang war triggered by the Gotham vigilante

270
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:32,745
known as Spoiler, Roman rebuilt his criminal
empire. He murdered Orpheus, a gang leader

271
00:25:32,805 --> 00:25:39,050
secretly allied with Batman, and assumed Orpheus'
identity to manipulate Gotham's underworld.

272
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:45,455
Roman's machinations made him the undisputed
king of Gotham's crime scene. However, Spoiler

273
00:25:45,515 --> 00:25:48,598
escaped his clutches, and Batman exposed his
deception.

274
00:25:53,846 --> 00:25:59,328
which instead returned him to Oracle's Clock
Tower. Though he survived Oracle's self-destruct

275
00:25:59,408 --> 00:26:05,731
trap, Spoiler did not survive the injuries she
sustained while tortured by Black Mask. The

276
00:26:05,771 --> 00:26:11,474
gang war subsided shortly after, and Roman's
empire began to fracture. Roman's reign of

277
00:26:11,514 --> 00:26:16,936
terror continued until he faced the Red Hood,
who targeted his operations in a calculated

278
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:23,119
campaign to dismantle his criminal empire. Despite
Roman's alliances with figures like Mr. Freeze

279
00:26:23,219 --> 00:26:29,283
and Deathstroke, the Red Hood's relentless attacks
destabilized his control. Roman's efforts to

280
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:34,846
consolidate power ultimately failed, culminating
in his defeat at the hands of Batman and the

281
00:26:34,906 --> 00:26:40,009
Red Hood. Roman eventually attempted to rebuild
his empire, shifting his focus to Gotham's

282
00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:44,972
East End, where he sought to control the drug
trade. This brought him into conflict with

283
00:26:45,072 --> 00:26:51,354
Catwoman, the self-appointed protector of the
area. Roman retaliated against Catwoman's interference

284
00:26:51,394 --> 00:26:56,756
by targeting her loved ones. He kidnapped her
sister Maggie and tortured her brother-in-law

285
00:26:56,876 --> 00:27:02,997
Simon to death. Roman forced Maggie to consume
parts of Simon's corpse, leaving her mentally

286
00:27:03,057 --> 00:27:09,019
shattered. Enraged, Catwoman confronted Roman
in his penthouse. Their battle ended with Catwoman

287
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:13,780
shooting Roman in the head, killing him. During
the Blackest Night, in which dead heroes and

288
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:21,795
villains of the past were resurrected Roman
used his Black Lantern powers to torment Catwoman

289
00:27:21,875 --> 00:27:28,058
further, desecrating her sister's mental institution
and creating torture chambers. However, Roman's

290
00:27:28,118 --> 00:27:33,360
rampage ended when Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn
joined forces with Catwoman to neutralize him.

291
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,522
Trapped in a carnivorous plant, Roman's Black
Lantern form was dissolved. In post-Flashpoint

292
00:27:39,563 --> 00:27:45,385
continuity, Roman Sionis returned as Black Mask,
though he was reimagined as a man with Dissociative

293
00:27:45,465 --> 00:27:51,664
Identity Disorder. his black mask persona exerting
dominance over his psyche. His signature ebony

294
00:27:51,704 --> 00:27:57,288
mask gained technological upgrades, granting
him the ability to control the minds of weaker-minded

295
00:27:57,388 --> 00:28:02,771
individuels. While imprisoned in Arkham Asylum,
Roman orchestrated a mass breakout during the

296
00:28:02,851 --> 00:28:08,694
Night of Owls, using his mind control abilities
to manipulate inmates into attacking the Court

297
00:28:08,734 --> 00:28:14,822
of Owl's assassins. Roman escaped Arkham and
reassembled the False Face Society. reigniting

298
00:28:14,942 --> 00:28:20,443
a violent rivalry with the Mad Hatter, another
villain known for mind control. Their feud

299
00:28:20,523 --> 00:28:26,145
drew the attention of Batman, who defeated both
men and destroyed Roman's mask, temporarily

300
00:28:26,225 --> 00:28:31,127
neutralizing his abilities. Over time, Roman
regained his status as one of Gotham's top

301
00:28:31,187 --> 00:28:36,368
crime bosses. He aligned with the Penguin and
Great White Shark in the Blacks and Whites

302
00:28:36,428 --> 00:28:42,290
Alliance, a coalition seeking to consolidate
Gotham's criminal enterprises. Roman also sought

303
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:47,695
to use his advanced technology, including a
techno-organic virus, to gain an edge over

304
00:28:47,735 --> 00:28:53,800
his rivals. This led to a confrontation with
Red Hood, who infiltrated Roman's masked organization

305
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:59,945
under the guise of an ally and exposed Roman's
operations, turning Roman's own resources against

306
00:28:59,985 --> 00:29:05,690
him. Alongside Artemis and Bizarro, Red Hood
dismantled Roman's empire, forcing a final

307
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,530
confrontation.

308
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:16,573
but the plan backfired, leaving him mentally
incapacitated and defeated. That's Black Mask's

309
00:29:16,614 --> 00:29:22,498
history so far. Power-wise, Black Mask's Ebony
Mask grants him a degree of mental influence

310
00:29:22,598 --> 00:29:28,622
over others, as well as protection for his head.
He's a criminal mastermind with access to a

311
00:29:28,682 --> 00:29:35,307
vast fortune and resources, including weaponry.
An expert marksman, Black Mask carries several

312
00:29:35,327 --> 00:29:40,558
handguns, which he'll have in this match, along
with a classic mobster tommy gun. He's in peak

313
00:29:40,598 --> 00:29:45,703
human physical condition and is a competent
fighter. When you were describing his backstory,

314
00:29:45,923 --> 00:29:52,789
the part where he disfigured his ex-fiance with
the mask, it made me think that Tim Burton's

315
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:58,915
1989 Batman film with Jack Nicholson's Joker
took inspiration maybe from Black Mask because

316
00:29:58,975 --> 00:30:04,360
there was that scene where Joker scarred the
face of Grisham's girl, right? Right. And she

317
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,954
wore that like white mannequin mask. Yeah, you
could definitely say that also because of the

318
00:30:07,994 --> 00:30:14,817
fact that Joker attacked Gotham with tainted
cosmetics. Yeah, yeah. Interesting. Okay. Black

319
00:30:14,837 --> 00:30:20,380
Mask was created in 1985, I believe. So that
could absolutely be the case that he inspired

320
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:25,202
Burns Joker. Yeah, he was probably on top of
mind at that time. So makes sense. Well, I

321
00:30:26,062 --> 00:30:31,124
honestly, I think the characters of Black Mask
and Madam Mask have even more in common than

322
00:30:31,184 --> 00:30:36,899
I realized. And let me go ahead and tell you
all about Madam Mask. Born as Julieta Neferia,

323
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:43,183
Madam Mask was introduced to a life of deception
from the start. Her father, Count Lucino Neferia,

324
00:30:43,223 --> 00:30:48,867
was a powerful crime lord in the Magia, a shadowy
crime syndicate resembling the Mafia based

325
00:30:48,907 --> 00:30:54,671
in New York City. Count Neferia desired a different
path for his daughter, a respectable life unmarred

326
00:30:54,711 --> 00:30:59,774
by the criminal underworld that defined his
own. Thus, he gave her up to Brian Frost, a

327
00:30:59,814 --> 00:31:07,350
trusted employee, and his wife Loretta, who
raised Whitney Frost. Whitney grew up as a

328
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:12,272
sophisticated debutante and socialite, moving
in elite circles and building connections for

329
00:31:12,332 --> 00:31:17,313
what she thought would be a prosperous, legitimate
life. She eventually became engaged to an ambitious

330
00:31:17,353 --> 00:31:22,234
politician, Roger Vane. However, her life was
shattered when her adoptive parents passed

331
00:31:22,274 --> 00:31:27,816
away and Count Nefaria re-entered her life,
revealing her true heritage and offering her

332
00:31:27,876 --> 00:31:33,906
a place in the Magia. Initially horrified, Whitney
turned to her fiance Roger for support. only

333
00:31:33,946 --> 00:31:39,428
to find him unwilling to risk his career for
her criminal connections. Heartbroken and betrayed,

334
00:31:39,768 --> 00:31:44,610
she reluctantly accepted her father's offer,
leaving behind her privileged life to learn

335
00:31:44,651 --> 00:31:50,793
the brutal arts of strategy, combat, and manipulation
under Neferia's guidance. Whitney proved to

336
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:55,075
be a natural in the criminal world, quickly
ascending to become the leader of the Neferia

337
00:31:55,115 --> 00:32:00,682
family within Demagia, adopting the alias Big
M. Under this persona, Whitney She aimed to

338
00:32:00,782 --> 00:32:05,945
infiltrate and raid Stark Industries, crossing
paths with Iron Man for the first time. The

339
00:32:06,025 --> 00:32:11,249
operation ended in disaster, and as she attempted
to escape on a plane, the aircraft crashed

340
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:17,433
and she was left horribly disfigured. Her life
was saved by Mordecai Midas, a crime lord with

341
00:32:17,453 --> 00:32:23,377
an obsession for gold, who gifted Whitney a
golden mask to cover her scars. With her new

342
00:32:23,457 --> 00:32:29,361
identity as Madame Masque, Whitney joined Midas'
empire and furthered her reputation as a ruthless

343
00:32:29,401 --> 00:32:35,454
criminal. In a fateful twist, Madame Masque
met Tony Stark, Iron Man's alter ego, and was

344
00:32:35,514 --> 00:32:40,818
drawn to him despite her adversarial relationship
with his superhero identity. Tony's compassion

345
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:45,862
for her scarred appearance softened her, and
Whitney eventually betrayed Midas to save Tony,

346
00:32:46,202 --> 00:32:51,126
only to disappear from his life, fearing her
past would forever haunt any chance of happiness.

You can learn more about Iron Man in his duel
against Cyborg.

348
00:32:59,918 --> 00:33:04,600
Chrissy Longfellow, his secretary. This charade
allowed them to rekindle their connection,

349
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,423
leading to a romance once their true identities
were revealed. Their happiness was cut short

350
00:33:09,443 --> 00:33:14,126
when Count Nefaria resurfaced, now on the verge
of death from a failed superhuman experiment.

351
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:19,329
Whitney brought her father to Stark, begging
him to find a cure. However, Nefaria's violent

352
00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:24,332
threats forced Iron Man to confront the crime
lord and his minions in a deadly clash. When

353
00:33:24,352 --> 00:33:29,126
Nefaria's life support system was damaged during
the fight, Whitney was struck by overwhelming

354
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:34,367
guilt and descended into madness, severing her
ties with Stark and returning to the Magia

355
00:33:34,688 --> 00:33:39,969
to reclaim her role as a ruthless leader. As
her criminal activities escalated, Madame Masque

356
00:33:40,029 --> 00:33:45,771
grew increasingly paranoid, fearing betrayal
and weakness. To maintain control, she created

357
00:33:45,871 --> 00:33:51,973
bioduplicates of herself, robots and clones
to act as her stand-ins and bodyguards. One

358
00:33:51,993 --> 00:33:57,311
of these bioduplicates, known simply as Masque,
developed an independent streak and became

359
00:33:57,351 --> 00:34:03,316
an ally to the Avengers, urging Whitney to reconsider
her path and join forces with the heroes. The

360
00:34:03,356 --> 00:34:08,079
duplicate's nobility led her to sacrifice herself
to protect the Avengers and take down Count

361
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:13,903
Nefaria, who had returned with powerful Ionic
abilities. This selfless act shook Whitney

362
00:34:13,923 --> 00:34:19,227
to her core, as she saw the admiration and mourning
from Iron Man and the Avengers, forcing her

363
00:34:19,247 --> 00:34:24,142
to confront the nature of her own paranoia and
distrust. Despite this revelation, she chose

364
00:34:24,222 --> 00:34:28,565
not to renounce her criminal past entirely,
though she acknowledged her need for change.

365
00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:32,767
Years later, Whitney found a new partner and
purpose when she became the second in command

366
00:34:32,848 --> 00:34:38,411
and lover to Parker Robbins, aka The Hood, a
rising figure in New York's criminal underworld.

367
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:43,494
With the superhero community fractured by the
Superhuman Registration Act, The Hood saw an

368
00:34:43,534 --> 00:34:48,817
opportunity to unite the underworld, using his
mystical powers to protect criminals in exchange

369
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:53,515
for their loyalty. Madame Masque joined them
in battling the New Avengers, though shortly

370
00:34:53,575 --> 00:34:58,498
after she fought alongside Earth's heroes to
repel the Skrull invasion, briefly aligning

371
00:34:58,538 --> 00:35:03,101
herself with humanity's defenders. You can learn
more about the Avengers and the Superhuman

372

Registration Act and the Skrull invasion in
our Justice League vs Avengers duel episode.

373
00:35:08,143 --> 00:35:12,546
Her relationship with the Hood deepened as she
supported him during his struggle with demonic

374
00:35:12,586 --> 00:35:16,988
possession by Dormammu, and her loyalty was
made evident when she finally revealed her

375
00:35:17,008 --> 00:35:22,562
disfigured face to him as a symbol of trust.
Despite this loyalty to the hood, she remained

376
00:35:22,742 --> 00:35:27,504
unable to suppress her volatile emotions for
Tony Stark, leading to a violent confrontation

377
00:35:27,524 --> 00:35:33,205
with Pepper Potts when Norman Osborn put a bounty
on Tony Stark's head. In a desperate bid to

378
00:35:33,245 --> 00:35:38,887
force Stark's love, she demanded his romantic
confession only for Tony to choose Pepper over

379
00:35:38,987 --> 00:35:45,048
her. Enraged, she engaged Pepper in the rescue
armor in a brutal fight only to be incarcerated.

380
00:35:45,588 --> 00:35:46,669
After escaping custody,

381
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:55,133
forming alliances and taking on high stakes
jobs. She connected again with the Hood, who

382
00:35:55,353 --> 00:36:01,538
now wielding the Reality Gem, used its power
to heal her facial scars. She traveled to Madripoor,

383
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:06,541
where she bit on a videotape that appeared to
blackmail Hawkeye for murder. During this mission,

384
00:36:06,862 --> 00:36:11,805
Madame Masque was ambushed by Kate Bishop, who
impersonated her in an attempt to recover the

385
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:16,969
tape, and it was destroyed. Furious, Madame
Masque vowed revenge on Kate and tracked her

386
00:36:16,989 --> 00:36:22,787
to Los Angeles, luring the hero into a trap
Kate would later escape. In the end, Shields

387
00:36:22,827 --> 00:36:29,069
dismantled Mademask's Los Angeles-based operation,
leading to her arrest. Upon her release, she

388
00:36:29,129 --> 00:36:33,970
joined Baron Zemo's Masters of Evil, acting
as his right-hand woman. You can learn more

389
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:38,731
about Kate Bishop in our Batgirl versus Hawkeye
duel episode, and more about Baron Zemo in

390
00:36:38,771 --> 00:36:43,553
his duel against Lex Luthor. Mademask's interests
took a darker turn, and she began collecting

391
00:36:43,613 --> 00:36:49,103
magical artifacts to empower herself. seeking
control over magic as a means of survival and

392
00:36:49,143 --> 00:36:55,205
dominance. She raided Castle Doom for the mystical
Wand of Votum, engaging in a showdown with

393
00:36:55,345 --> 00:37:00,828
Ironman, after which she was possessed by demonic
forces. Only a collaboration between Doctor

394
00:37:00,868 --> 00:37:05,629
Doom and Doctor Strange saved her as they performed
an exorcism and handed her over to S.H.I.E.L.D.

395
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:11,772
custody. After escaping, Mademask orchestrated
a brutal gang war in New York, faking her own

396
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:17,299
death in a car explosion set by the Magia Enforcer
turned leader. Hammerhead. She infiltrated

397
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:22,263
the Magia from within in disguise, capturing
Hammerhead and declaring herself the new leader

398
00:37:22,303 --> 00:37:27,287
of the organization. Seeking total control of
New York's crime scene, she manipulated her

399
00:37:27,327 --> 00:37:32,251
rivals through mind control, gathering her forces
for a final showdown with the rival gangs.

400
00:37:32,771 --> 00:37:37,555
However, Spider-Man and his allies intervened,
disrupting her plans as they freed her mind-controlled

401
00:37:37,595 --> 00:37:42,079
allies. Despite her careful preparations, she
was turned over to authorities by Spider-Man,

402
00:37:42,419 --> 00:37:47,983
swearing vengeance against him and her gang
And that's her backstory. Powers-wise, Madam

403
00:37:48,003 --> 00:37:53,225
Mask has no innate superhuman abilities, but
is trained and skilled in a variety of arenas.

404
00:37:53,765 --> 00:37:58,967
This includes her expertise in gymnastics, martial
arts, and marksmanship. She wears a golden

405
00:37:59,007 --> 00:38:04,170
mask that can protect her head from psychic
intrusion and gunfire. She is a master of disguise,

406
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:08,972
often using her resources to create technological
and biological clones of herself for further

407
00:38:09,012 --> 00:38:13,373
deception, though for this match she'll employ
holographic image-inducers for that effect.

408
00:38:13,826 --> 00:38:17,869
She carries modified handguns that can fire
high caliber bullets, concussive blasts of

409
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:23,653
energy, or sleeping gas cartridges. She is also
a master strategist and has dabbled in some

410
00:38:23,694 --> 00:38:29,578
magic using artifacts that can induce hypnosis.
Her weakness is that she is always extremely

411
00:38:29,638 --> 00:38:34,742
paranoid, making her mentally unstable. And
there you have it. She has a lot of gadgets

412
00:38:34,762 --> 00:38:39,086
and stuff, but I'm not worried. Black Mask's
got this because she doesn't have any gadgets

413
00:38:39,106 --> 00:38:46,355
to stop bullets. Well she has her mask, her
golden mask. As does Black Mask. So I guess

414
00:38:46,375 --> 00:38:52,619
we're even. A wooden mask is not bulletproof.
Not like a gold plated metal mask is. So I

415
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:57,922
don't know how Black Mask's mask is going to
stop bullets. But I guess we'll find out. Dude,

416
00:38:57,982 --> 00:39:03,565
Ebony is real hard. Yeah, and these are real
hard bullets. And you are real hard headed.

417
00:39:04,005 --> 00:39:07,888
If you think he's going to win this match. I
thought you were going an entirely different

418
00:39:07,908 --> 00:39:10,689
route. I'm so glad that you said headed right
there. Yes.

419
00:39:17,902 --> 00:39:23,564
Where fantasies collide and heroes clash, one
podcast network rises above the rest. Prepare

420
00:39:23,584 --> 00:39:29,307
yourself for the ultimate showdowns in comic

424
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:53,683
Join us as we speculate on the matches and armed
with the power of mathematical simulations,

425
00:39:53,924 --> 00:40:00,809
discover who will emerge victorious. Visit dynamicpodcast.com
where we settle the debate and settle the score.

426
00:40:05,143 --> 00:40:08,525
But now that we've got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

427
00:40:08,565 --> 00:40:14,509
of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not the speculation,

428
00:40:14,549 --> 00:40:20,193
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could
play out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?

429
00:40:20,953 --> 00:40:24,936
Well, I should say there are no rules, other
than the characters have no prior knowledge

430
00:40:24,976 --> 00:40:29,359
of the other going into the fight. All they
are aware of starting out is that the other

431
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:34,466
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.
For the speculation... contestants will begin

432
00:40:34,506 --> 00:40:39,569
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript
environment that will have no bearing on the

433
00:40:39,609 --> 00:40:44,952
match itself as no environmental statistics
are considered in my simulations. The contestants

434
00:40:44,992 --> 00:40:49,775
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright
then let's get into it. Black Mask and Madame

435
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:55,858
Mask meet on the battlefield. Who goes first?
I think since Black Mask has a Tommy gun, he

436
00:40:56,038 --> 00:41:04,018
has to start by just blasting that thing at
Madame Masque, Say hello to my little friend.

437
00:41:04,058 --> 00:41:11,140
All right, so Madam Masks is like, oh shit.
And she immediately takes off running. But

438
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:15,521
as she runs, she's going to start creating holographic
copies of herself using her image inducer.

439
00:41:16,101 --> 00:41:21,143
And soon there's like 15 different Madam Masks
on the battlefield. And Black Mask doesn't

440
00:41:21,163 --> 00:41:25,964
know which one is real. And he runs out of bullets.
OK, so that's when he just pulls out his spare

441
00:41:26,144 --> 00:41:31,494
ammo drum from his jacket. He's going to lock
that thing into place. and just start blasting

442
00:41:31,554 --> 00:41:36,557
all of the figures in front of him, just laughing
like a maniac. All right, well, his laughing

443
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:43,841
like ha is gonna turn into ow ow, when suddenly
the real Madame Masque shoots the Tommy gun

444
00:41:43,981 --> 00:41:49,144
with a concussive beam from her handgun, and
it's just gonna shatter his Tommy gun, exploding

445
00:41:49,244 --> 00:41:53,846
it in Black Mask's hands, and then she's gonna
fire another round from a second pistol, this

446
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:59,369
time it's a high caliber bullet, that goes right
through one of his knee caps. Oh damn, well.

447
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:06,721
Okay, Black Mask, he has a high tolerance for
pain. So as he is limping to the side to dodge

448
00:42:06,822 --> 00:42:12,285
any more gunfire, he's going to pull out his
handgun from his holster and just bullseye

449
00:42:12,305 --> 00:42:17,067
Madam Mask right in the forehead, which, you
know, isn't going to kill her, but it certainly

450
00:42:17,087 --> 00:42:23,791
knocks her out cold. Well, she got shot in the
face with her mask on. We'll say she's heavily

451
00:42:23,851 --> 00:42:29,399
dazed and on the ground for sure. And while
she's on the ground. That's when Black Mask

452
00:42:29,419 --> 00:42:34,423
is gonna limp over to her and pull out a pair
of needle nose pliers, like one of several

453
00:42:34,463 --> 00:42:41,929
torture devices he probably keeps on him, which
he uses to grab her ear and he starts yanking

454
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:48,235
it to rip it off. That's some sick twisted shit,
man. I've honestly, I've seen Black Mask do

455
00:42:48,275 --> 00:42:53,820
worse. Well, before he can yank her ear off
with pliers, she's gonna snap right out of

456
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:59,528
her fog from being shot. She's gonna pull out
a magical artifact from her utility belt that

457
00:42:59,548 --> 00:43:05,833
looks like a small sundial, which is gonna create
this like hypnotic sigil. And she's gonna put

458
00:43:05,893 --> 00:43:11,637
Black Mask under a hypnotic trance. And while
he's in this like stupor, she's gonna stand

459
00:43:11,697 --> 00:43:16,540
up and just start pistol whipping the shit out
of him. Calling him a sick fuck and knocking

460
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:22,244
the ebony teeth out of his skull mask and just
stomping him in the ribs, cracking him. Well,

461
00:43:22,444 --> 00:43:28,129
I mean that would certainly snap- Black Mask
out of his hypnosis. We'll see that as, you

462
00:43:28,149 --> 00:43:32,713
know, Meta Mask is about to stomp his torso
again, Black Mask quickly just pulls out a

463
00:43:32,753 --> 00:43:39,039
knife and drives into Meta Mask's shin before
pulling it out and slicing her other leg's

464
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:45,104
ankle. Okay, so they're basically just reducing
each other to crawling and limping for the

465
00:43:45,124 --> 00:43:49,968
rest of this match, I guess. Basically. She's
gonna fall to the ground, and as Black Mask

466
00:43:50,008 --> 00:43:55,107
like tries to crawl over to her, Madam Mask
is gonna unleash a gas pellet that like fills

467
00:43:55,147 --> 00:44:00,489
her vicinity with sleeping gas and that's gonna
knock Black Mask out cold. It's not gonna knock

468
00:44:00,529 --> 00:44:07,032
her out too? No, she has a mask on. So does
he! Yeah, but hers like covers her nose and

469
00:44:07,072 --> 00:44:12,014
mouth. Well how does she breathe then? Well
like through a respirator in her mask, most

470
00:44:12,034 --> 00:44:17,416
likely. Interesting. Anyway, she doesn't get
affected by the sleeping gas, he does, he's

471
00:44:17,476 --> 00:44:22,178
out cold, that gives her enough time to crawl
over to him. and she's just going to yank his

472
00:44:22,198 --> 00:44:27,620
mask off and finish him off with a shot right
through the forehead. Well, I mean, his mask

473
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:33,903
is actually melted onto his face. So it'd be
hard to just yank off. That's exactly what

474
00:44:33,923 --> 00:44:38,765
she does then. She just rips the whole damn
face off. Damn! Just like in that movie. Face

475
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:45,608
off? No, not that one. Guardians of the Galaxy
3? Yep, there you go. That's what I'm talking

476
00:44:45,648 --> 00:44:52,279
about. Okay, well, as she's yanking his face
off, Again, that for sure wakes Black Mask

477
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:58,164
up. You know, he just snaps out of it and he
quickly whips out like a small torch from his

478
00:44:58,204 --> 00:45:03,628
sleeve and just burns her right in the gut while
she's over him. And while she's in shock from

479
00:45:03,668 --> 00:45:09,192
this attack, he's going to rip off her mask
and allowing him to influence her psychically

480
00:45:09,712 --> 00:45:14,856
into taking her own life. Wait, so he has like
a mini blowtorch on him. Yeah, like all kinds

481
00:45:14,876 --> 00:45:21,029
of like torture gear. OK. Well, I think honestly,
he'd be in too much pain from getting his face

482
00:45:21,089 --> 00:45:26,793
peeled off to do any sort of psychic attack
or anything really. So, yeah, I think Madame

483
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:31,777
Mask ends up winning. Well, he couldn't even
do the psychic attack if the mask was removed

484
00:45:31,817 --> 00:45:37,562
from his face. So this happens before that.
She doesn't even get to rip off his mask. And

485
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:43,187
I'm saying she does. So let's go ahead and find
out what scenario happens. Either she pills

486
00:45:43,267 --> 00:45:50,392
his face off with his mask or he. peels her
mask off and psychically gets her to off herself.

487
00:45:51,053 --> 00:45:55,036
Either way, somebody's mask is coming off. Let's
find out which one by inputting the stats,

488
00:45:55,376 --> 00:46:01,782
running the simulations and coming back with
a winner. AJ9K, hit it. Inputting data, running

489
00:46:01,822 --> 00:46:08,207
calculations, processing results, simulations
complete. You know, sometimes we do matches

490
00:46:08,347 --> 00:46:13,331
on this show, like the Two-Face and Jigsaw one
comes to mind, where it's like, we just need

491
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:19,100
therapy afterward. It's just too violent. or
like Red Hood and Punisher, the characters

492
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:24,724
with guns who like don't have any other powers
except for that are not fun to speculate with.

493
00:46:25,225 --> 00:46:30,730
Yeah, but I don't know, I think we did as well
as we could with these two characters. Statistically

494
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:36,775
they were pretty close to being even. We said
they had about the same speed, durability,

495
00:46:36,955 --> 00:46:42,179
damage level, fighting skill, intelligence,
range, and perception. Yeah, no surprise there.

496
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:47,583
I figured the characters were going to be really
similar. We did give the edge in evasiveness

497
00:46:47,663 --> 00:46:53,307
to Madam Mask as well as the edge in versatility.
Yeah, because she is like an Olympic level

498
00:46:53,508 --> 00:46:59,011
gymnast and has like magical artifacts and high
tech gadgets like sleeping gas pellets and

499
00:46:59,051 --> 00:47:05,636
stuff like that. Where Madam Mask had an advantage
in agility over Black Mask, Black Mask had

500
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:10,559
a slight advantage in strength. Yeah, the dude
was literally able to destroy his father's

501
00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:17,143
coffin with a huge rock slab with his bare hands.
and go toe to toe with Batman. So yeah, dude's

502
00:47:17,183 --> 00:47:23,805
jacked. Not like Ewan McGregor at all. But taking
all of this into consideration, Joseph, who

503
00:47:23,825 --> 00:47:28,287
do you think is gonna get the win? I think Madame
Massey is gonna take it. I think she just has

504
00:47:28,327 --> 00:47:33,529
a lot going for her in terms of the number of
gadgets she has, which I think gives her the

505
00:47:33,589 --> 00:47:38,696
versatility to. avoid damage and to really cause
confusion on the battlefield, whether it's

506
00:47:38,716 --> 00:47:43,039
through her duplicates or whether it's through
her magical artifacts, something like that,

507
00:47:43,139 --> 00:47:49,043
I think is going to put her over the top here.
And no one agrees with me. Basically on Instagram,

508
00:47:49,303 --> 00:47:55,248
Black Mask clearly won that poll that we've
put up there with 69% of the poll takers saying

509
00:47:55,288 --> 00:48:01,152
that Black Mask was going to beat Madame Masque.
You know why? It's because he's cool. Way cooler

510
00:48:01,172 --> 00:48:06,195
than Madame Masque. No one knows who the hell
she is. Iron Man fans know who Madam Mask is.

511
00:48:06,555 --> 00:48:11,800
Yeah, but Iron Man fans are MCU fans and they
don't read the comics. They have no idea who

512
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:16,824
she is. I think they do. Well, let's find out
if the Instagram poll matches the actual results.

513
00:48:17,304 --> 00:48:24,610
AJ9K, the results please. Here you are, sir.
All right, the winner of the matchup between

514
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:39,798
Black Mask and Madam Mask is... Madam Mask.
She won. 573 of the 1000 matches or 57.3% of

515
00:48:39,838 --> 00:48:46,583
the time compared to Black Mask who only won
42.7. I mean Black Mask might be brutal but

516
00:48:46,703 --> 00:48:51,266
he just doesn't have enough brutality to overcome
everything that MadamaSK can throw at him.

517
00:48:51,687 --> 00:48:56,830
Yeah what gave her the win was definitely her
increased versatility and evasiveness. It was

518
00:48:56,850 --> 00:49:01,314
something that Black Mask just couldn't compete
with. It's actually a higher percentage. then

519
00:49:01,374 --> 00:49:05,756
I thought she would win by like it's almost
60% which was kind of surprising. Well when

520
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:13,221
you think about it, Black Mask is just a dude
with a gun and a black mask. Yeah, that's fair.

521
00:49:13,901 --> 00:49:20,585
It's literally in the name what he is. Are you
sad? Eh, not really. There are other Batman

522
00:49:20,605 --> 00:49:26,709
villains that I'm bigger fans of. He's pretty
brutal in the comics, you know, as are a lot

523
00:49:26,769 --> 00:49:31,312
of Batman villains, but I don't know, he just
doesn't have as much character I would say.

524
00:49:31,933 --> 00:49:36,357
Yeah, you're sad. I feel like you want me to
be more sad. And I'm not going to give you

525
00:49:36,378 --> 00:49:41,263
that satisfaction. You know what? I'm happy
he lost. I'm proud that he lost. Yeah, what

526
00:49:41,303 --> 00:49:48,670
are you going to do? Call you a fake DC fan,
I guess. Oh, no, I am sad. But that does it

527
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:56,467

533
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:34,264
time between another Batman villain, Copperhead,
against a Spider-Man villain, Scorpion. Yeah,

534
00:50:34,284 --> 00:50:38,347
we're going with the Spider-Man villain and
lead up to the Kraven the Hunter film that

535
