This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi, welcome to
the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,140
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:38,680
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Johnny DC and I'm his twin

4
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:45,460
brother Marvelous Joe. And in this episode we are
doing our monthly team duel, this time pitting

5
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:53,140
Infinity, Inc. versus the New Warriors. Now tell
me if I'm wrong, Jonathan. Infinity, Inc. is to the

6
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:59,200
Justice Society as the Teen Titans are to the
Justice League. Yeah, it's basically a team made

7
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:07,640
up of legacy characters or successors to the
Justice Society members. Now I wouldn't call the

8
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:13,980
New Warriors a legacy team because a lot of them are
original to the team but they are a young group of

9
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:20,100
badasses. And I can't wait for them to mop the floor
with Infinity, Inc. Clearly you know nothing

10
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:26,520
about Infinity, Inc. I don't really know. That's
true. A lot of people don't. It was a short-lived

11
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,100
team but a cool team and we're gonna learn all about
it later on in this episode. Before that we're

12
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:37,260
gonna break down the comic book movie news from the
past week of which there was just one major news

13
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:43,480
item and that was the release dates that have been
pushed back for Avengers Doomsday and Avengers

14
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:49,040
Secret Wars. As always we list our segment times in

Quick to the no prize. A no prize is an award that

28
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,780
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version the
Dynamic Dual No Prize is a digital award we post on

29
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:58,800
Instagram for the person that we feel gave the best
answer to our question of the week. Last week we

30
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:05,980
asked you guys who had the better official trailer
from a couple weeks ago. Superman or Iron Heart and

31
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:11,220
why and both of those trailers were released on the
same day and we wanted to see you know what you guys

32
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,600
liked more. So let's go ahead and say two honorable
mentions and a no prize winner. Our first

33
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:24,040
honorable mention goes to Lorenzo Valdez who said
this is Lorenzo Valdez calling in once again. I

34
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,580
quite like the Iron Heart trailer and I'm very much
looking forward to that show but it doesn't hold a

35
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:35,700
candle to the Superman trailer. I mean the shot of
Clark young Clark running into Jonathan's arms

36
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:42,520
that shot alone gives the Superman trailer the
edge I think I would I would vote for it just based on

37
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,400
that shot alone. Clon of forever and always. Bye
bye. Yeah if there's one thing that I've come to

38
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:54,500
associate with James Gunn and his filmmaking it's
that he is pretty damn good at pulling on the heart

39
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,860
strings whether it was the Suicide Squad or even
Peacemaker and Guardians of the Galaxy for sure he

40
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:06,580
knows how to tell an emotional story and I
absolutely am expecting that for this upcoming

41
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:12,480
Superman movie especially when you have things in
the trailer like a little boy just running up to his

42
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:18,220
dad excited. I'm not gonna lie I stopped listening
to Lorenzo's answer about a third of the way

43
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,840
through so all I know is that he really liked the
Iron Heart trailer which makes sense it's gonna be

44
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,520
a great show. I don't know what to say clean your
ears apparently. Great answer Lorenzo our next

45
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,320
honorable mention goes to Buster Barnes who said
hi guys Buster Barnes here and the best trailer out

46
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:39,780
of Iron Heart and Superman was definitely Iron
Heart. I mean been waiting to see if you really was

47
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,320
on the screen for a long time you know after with
Canada forever really just couldn't wait to see

48
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,260
her you know said absolutely no one ever. I mean
Superman definitely cleared and it's gonna be

49
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:57,060
amazing best superhero movie of 2025 and yeah I
can't wait for July let's go. Not gonna lie you had

50
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,000
me there totally thought you were gonna go the Iron
Heart route but then you had that twist reveal at

51
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
the end and totally saved your answer and yes
you're correct Superman is gonna be so much better

52
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,560
than Iron Heart it's not even funny. I'm not gonna
lie either I stopped listening to Buster's answer

53
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,440
about midway through so all I heard is that he
thinks that the Iron Heart trailer was better and

54
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,580
that he can't wait to see Riri Williams again. Okay
so you need to get your ears checked and your brain

55
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:31,000
checked. Great answer Buster but the winner of
this week's no prize is Brian Rochester who said.

56
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,940
Hello I'm gonna be controversial in this question
and say both trailers are good. I cannot pick

57
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:48,020
between Marvel and DC I've always liked both and
I'm going to be the outlaw on this so there you have

58
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:53,620
it. Now normally Jonathan on this podcast we don't
like people to straddle the fence we like them to

59
00:06:53,620 --> 00:07:00,040
pick a side but I think in this particular case with
this question of the week this was clearly the best

60
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:05,720
answer of the group. The only reason this is
getting the no prize win for anyone who's curious

61
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:12,640
is because we do give points for originality and
since he gave a unique answer that no one else gave

62
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:18,060
yeah we're gonna give it to him even though he knows
in his heart that the Superman trailer was better

63
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:24,420
he knows in his heart that Iron Heart was fantastic
correct yes. When's the last time you had a CAT

64
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:31,240
scan? Because he needed another one your due.
Great answer Brian you and this week's no prize if

65
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,360
you the listener want to shout out winning your own
no prize stay tuned to later on this episode when

66
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:46,360
we'll be asking another question of the week and
now that that's done. Lots of the news! So this past

67
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:52,980
week we got the total bullshit news that the
Avengers Doomsday and Avengers Secret Wars films

68
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:58,600
are going to be pushed back from May in their
respective years to December. Specifically

69
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:07,540
Avengers Doomsday has been moved from May 1st of
2026 to December 18th and Avengers Secret Wars has

70
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:15,200
been pushed from May 7th of 2027 to December 17th.
So these films are no longer opening the summer

71
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:22,180
movie frame but instead coming out in the winter
holiday season. No one knows why it's very likely

72
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,180
that these films are being pushed back because
they're just so gargantuan that there wasn't

73
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:33,840
enough time within the span of this upcoming year
to adequately fulfill what is necessary in terms

74
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:40,039
of like special effects and post production and
perhaps reshoots if necessary. Sometimes those

75
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:45,360
are the breaks and things like this just happen in
life. Yeah, I keep hearing rumors about more

76
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:52,080
people joining these casts, specifically
Doomsday's cast. And I have to imagine with all of

77
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,500
those actors there's got to be schedule
conflicts. So I'm actually not surprised that

78
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:03,100
this has been pushed back if they want to bring on
more people and just need to work around their

79
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:08,800
schedule adding more buffer time to kind of get
things sorted. Yeah, right, because it seems like

80
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:15,020
the Avengers Doomsday cast is larger than even
Infinity War or Endgame and it's possible the

81
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:21,120
Secret Wars cast is just as large. So considering
that scale, I totally understand why Marvel

82
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:28,060
Studios would make this call. I understand it, I
respect it, but damn does it disgust me still. I

83
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:33,940
don't want to wait. I feel so impatient for these
upcoming Avengers films. The hype is already

84
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,640
building. It's been building ever since, you
know, the cast announcement and we've heard so

85
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,720
much speculation regarding the plot of these
films. I just can't help but be super excited and

86
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,420
therefore super disappointed that we have to wait
seven months longer, eight months longer. One of

87
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:54,280
those two. Yeah, I could take them or leave them,
you know, maybe they won't even come out. Shut the

88
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:00,760
fuck up. Don't you put that evil out there in the
world, Jonathan? Speaking of speculation, it's

89
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,620
also currently being speculated that the
upcoming Spider-Man film will also get a release

90
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:12,180
date push. Oh my God, shut up. We don't want to hear
that. We don't want to hear that. It was originally

91
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:18,200
supposed to come out between Avengers Doomsday
and Secret Wars. So if they want to keep that story

92
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,060
continuity, yeah, that's probably going to go
back as well. You know what the plus side of this

93
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:29,620
could be that if they were to fast track the Blade
movie, they could probably still get it out before

94
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:35,780
the Avengers film. It would have to be sort of like a
small stakes story without much special effects

95
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,500
or anything like that. But they could pull it off if
they really wanted to, if they just got their shit

96
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,920
together and got the Blade movie going. I agree.
Marvel does need to get their shit together. No

97
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:50,400
more so than DC. Like what's going on with the
Batman movie? Exactly. That's none of your

98
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,900
business. What's going on? Wouldn't you like to
know, Weather Boy? No, I don't really care

99
00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:01,420
actually. But speaking of the upcoming Avengers
Doomsday film, we have a question to ask you guys

100
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:11,720
for our question of the week. What is your favorite
theory as to why Victor Von Doom would look like

101
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:16,520
Tony Stark? If you guys have been listening to this
podcast, you'll know that Jonathan and I

102
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,460
absolutely hate the idea of Robert Downey Jr.
returning as Victor Von Doom because it doesn't

103
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:28,260
give the character of Victor Von Doom, as we know
him from the comics, his do as his own original,

104
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,160
incredible character. Maybe he's going to turn
out to be a variant or something like that. But

105
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,160
there are a lot of interesting ideas that
rationalize why Victor Von Doom would have Tony

106
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,660
Stark's face. So whether it's your original
theory or something you heard online, let us know

107
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:48,480
how this casting can best be explained. Record

Dynamic Duel No Prize that we'll post to

113
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:51,000
But that does it for the news portion of this
episode. Now let's go ahead and move on to the main

114
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:14,660
event, the team duel between DC's Infinity Inc.
and Marvel's new warriors. Okay, Infinity Inc

115
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:20,780
versus new warriors. As we mentioned at the top of
the episode, these are both teams comprised of

116
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:26,660
younger heroes, or at least heroes that are
starting out. You'll be familiar with quite a few

117
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:33,820
of the Infinity Inc. team members if you watched
the Star Girl television series that was on CW.

118
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:42,020
Characters like Wildcat 2, Brainwave, Our Man,
and even Dr. Midnight, the Beth Chapel version,

119
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:49,240
were all members of Infinity Inc. Now there was
going to be a new warriors television series up

120
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:55,600
until Marvel Studios took over all of the Marvel
television series. Right, yeah. When the Marvel

121
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,100
television division was folded under the Marvel
Studios umbrella, a lot of the existing

122
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,280
television projects got reshuffled and some got
cancelled entirely. The new warriors television

123
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,940
show was going to start Milana Vayntrabe as
Squirrel Girl, and reports said that the show was

124
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,080
actually really good, but sometimes things just
don't pan out that way, which is a shame. But the new

125
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,940
warriors is a pretty cool group of heroes. It
includes characters that we've done duels with,

126
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:25,120
including Speedball and Nova, and some
additional characters that we haven't done

127
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,700
individual duels with, but I'll be sure to get into
their backstory within the larger new warriors

128
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:36,640
history. I will never forgive Kevin Feige for
taking away the AT &T girl Squirrel Girl from us.

129
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:42,200
Yeah, I don't think anyone will. That's his
biggest crime so far as a producer. 100%. But

130
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,120
getting into this team duel to explain the
methodology behind it, let's go to our sentient

131
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:54,340
duel simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K, tell
our listeners how you go about determining a

132
00:14:54,340 --> 00:15:00,400
winning team in our team duel matchups. Yes, of
course, sir. The way I determine a winner between

133
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,560
the two teams is by running 1000 Monte Carlo
simulations between every character on each team

134
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:10,880
using their statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation
is a probabilistic model used to determine

135
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,940
outcomes through random sampling. In this case, I
randomize the statistics along a normal

136
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:20,980
distribution as a way to simulate the many
variables that can occur during battle. The stat

137
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:26,060
parameters are based on the official Marvel power
grid from which the DC characters statistics are

138
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:31,420
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are
included such as range, damage potential,

139
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:36,620
versatility and perception in order to create a
more detailed and accurate simulation. The

140
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,480
results of the 49000 simulations provide a
percentage of wins for each character on both

141
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:46,160
teams. The team with the higher average win rate is
declared the victor as they have a higher

142
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,680
probability to win any given battle. In an
equitable pairing, neither team should win 100%

143
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,940
of the matches. The comic book stories have shown
that there's even a way for Batman to defeat

144
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,360
Superman, so the confidence rate of my method
falls in line with the precedents that have been

145
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,240
established in the source material. My
mathematical simulations are without

146
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,920
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for

147
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,180
determination of the winner. Thanks, Agent 9K!
Before we run the simulations though, we like to

148
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:20,460
break down each team's histories and rosters
before improvising a scenario on how we imagine

149
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:26,260
one of the thousands of simulations would play out
beat for beat. And it is my turn to go first with the

150
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:32,320
Marvel team history, so let me tell you all about
the new Warriors. Under the leadership of Dwayne

151
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:38,180
Taylor, better known as Night Thrasher, the new
Warriors emerged as a team of young superheroes

152
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,300
determined to prove themselves in a world
dominated by older, more established crime

153
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:49,040
fighters. Dwayne's crusade began in tragedy when
as a child he witnessed the murder of his wealthy

154
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,740
parents. Raised by their associates Andrew Corde
and Ty, Dwayne grew up obsessively training in

155
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:01,240
combat and tactics, eventually taking to the
streets as a costumed vigilante. Inspired by the

156
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,700
familial bond of the Fantastic Four and
encouraged by Corde to build his own team, Dwayne

157
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:12,000
identified and sought out like-minded young
heroes to join him. Among his first recruits was

158
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,980
Richard Ryder, the former Nova who had been
depowered after his time at the Nova Corps.

159
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:22,160
Believing Ryder's powers could be reactivated
under stress, Night Thrasher forcibly dropped

160
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,480
him from a building, a move that successfully
reawakened Ryder's abilities and brought him

161
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,400
reluctantly into the fold. Dwayne also
approached telekinetic mutant Vance Astrovic,

162
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,620
then operating as Marvel Boy. Vance had recently
tried to join the Avengers but was rejected for

163
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:44,960
being too inexperienced. Eager for validation
and community, he accepted Dwayne's offer. The

164
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,580
final founding member Dwayne sought out was
Angelica Jones, known as Firestar, a mutant with

165
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,120
microwave energy powers who had previously
trained under the White Queen Emma Frost at the

166
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,880
Massachusetts Academy. Though hesitant,
Firestar joined after Night Thrasher uncovered

167
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,920
her identity and applied pressure. You can learn
more about the White Queen in her duel episode

168
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:09,600
against Poison Ivy. Before the group could
formally establish themselves, they were thrust

169
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,860
into battle against Terriks, a cosmic threat and
former Herald of Galactus. During this

170
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,540
encounter, the group was joined by two additional
heroes, the hyperactive Speedball with kinetic

171
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:25,360
absorption powers and Namorita, who was the
cousin to Namor the Submariner and a genetically

172
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,260
engineered clone of her mother, Namora.
Speedball coined the team's name, the New

173
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:35,160
Warriors, based on a news broadcast and the team
established their base in the penthouse of the

174
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:40,580
Ambrose building, funded by Dwayne's Family
Foundation. The team quickly became involved in a

175
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:45,060
range of battles, helping Thor combat the
juggernaut and confronting the sinister genetic

176
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:50,780
research corporation, Genitech. Genitech,
using data from the Mad Thinker, created a rival

177
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:56,580
team of unstable superhumans called Psionics.
These adversaries would become recurring foils

178
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:01,540
for the New Warriors, with shifting alliances
forming over time. Additional threats to the team

179
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,840
included the White Queen's Helians,
Environmental Extremists known as the Force of

180
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:12,320
Nature, and the corrupted corporate giant
Obadiah Stain, Stain International. While the

181
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:18,340
Warriors expanded their ranks, adding heroes
like Darkhawk, Rage, Turbo and Silhouette, the

182
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:23,220
team began experiencing internal changes.
Namorita, while juggling her responsibilities

183
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,980
with the Warriors, faced revelations about her
own identity. Having grown up believing she was

184
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:33,160
Namora's daughter, she was shocked to discover
she was, in fact, a clone. This revelation, along

185
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:37,640
with increasing leadership demands after Night
Thrasher's periodic absences, led to mounting

186
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:43,160
personal struggles. Her brief tenure as team
leader ended in disaster when she unwittingly

187
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,690
allowed the villainous Poison Memories gang
access to the Warriors' personal information.

188
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:53,730
The gang attacked the team's families, killing
Rage's grandmother and deeply traumatizing the

189
00:19:53,730 --> 00:20:00,030
group. Namorita briefly left the team, only to
return later as Chimera after undergoing a

190
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:06,190
transformation into a more traditionally blue
Atlantean form. Vance's romantic relationship

191
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:11,310
with Firestar deepened, but his personal life
remained complicated. He had been raised in an

192
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:16,770
abusive household and during an altercation,
accidentally killed his father. The resulting

193
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:22,510
trial revealed years of domestic abuse, and
although Vance was acquitted of murder, he was

194
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:28,050
convicted of negligent homicide. Choosing to
serve a sentence in the vault, he demonstrated a

195
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:33,670
firm moral compass and resolve, later returning
to the new Warriors' team under the new code name,

196
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:38,510
Justice. Angelica Jones, aka Firestar,
meanwhile, continued to struggle with the

197
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:43,430
consequences of her powers. As an Avengers
recruit early on, she discovered that prolonged

198
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:49,190
use of her microwave emissions could render her
infertile. This discovery caused tension in her

199
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:53,970
engagement to Justice, but was eventually
addressed when Hank Pym designed a suit that

200
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:59,790
regulated her radiation powers. With new control
over her abilities, Firestar played key roles

201
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:05,470
both on and off the team, including aiding
Spider-Man against Carnage and participating in

202
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:10,390
Avengers' missions against Ultron and King the
Conqueror. Night Thrasher's journey took an

203
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:15,590
increasingly darker turn as he uncovered
corruption within the Taylor Foundation. His

204
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:20,830
adoptive guardian, Court, had been mystically
compelled by his other guardian, Ty, to murder

205
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:27,470
Dwayne's parents as part of a larger occult plot.
Ty, a member of the Dragon's Breath cult, intended

206
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:33,430
to sacrifice super-powered youth to harness the
energies of a mystical nexus called the Well of All

207
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:38,810
Things. Ty's long-term manipulation, including
orchestrating the formation of the new warriors

208
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:44,430
as potential sacrifices, was exposed during a
climactic showdown in Cambodia where Night

209
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:50,550
Thrasher killed Ty to save the team. Following
Ty's death, Dwayne and Court began to rebuild the

210
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:56,190
Taylor Foundation and the new warriors' trust.
Dwayne became legal guardian to rage and the

211
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:01,690
mutant Microbe brought an ink his role as a mentor.
However, as Dwayne's crime-fighting methods

212
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:07,710
grew increasingly unorthodox, including using
wealth to coerce or buy out criminals, his

213
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:12,610
leadership came into question. This culminated
in his expulsion from the new warriors, although

214
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:17,550
he would rejoin them again after Stintin Japan
studying martial arts and aiding Iron Fist

215
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:21,950
against the Hand. The team faced additional
challenges including confrontations with the

216
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:27,430
villainous Folding Circle, genetically
engineered threats like Helix and cosmic foes

217
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:32,650
such as the Sphinx. At one point, the warriors were
scattered across time, requiring a secondary

218
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:38,050
team to rescue them. As the core members matured,
the team experienced repeated shifts in

219
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:43,430
leadership and lineup. Justice and Firestar
eventually joined the Avengers, while new

220
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:49,130
recruits like Aegis, Boltz, and Debris helped
keep the team active. As public interest in the

221
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:54,950
team waned, Night Thrasher rebooted the new
warriors as a reality TV series to fund their

222
00:22:54,950 --> 00:23:00,070
activities. This controversial move brought
back core members like Nova, Speedball, and

223
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:05,310
Namorita alongside newer heroes like Microbe and
Debris. The show chronicled their

224
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:10,150
crime-fighting exploits across small-town
America, but during one such mission in Stamford,

225
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:15,030
Connecticut, the warriors confronted a group of
supervillains that included Nitro, who had the

226
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:20,990
ability to self-detonate and reform from a
gaseous state. In an attempt to subdue him,

227
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:25,870
Namorita slammed Nitro into a bus and taunted him,
prompting Nitro to detonate an catastrophic

228
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:31,610
explosion that killed over 600 civilians,
including schoolchildren and most of the new

229
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:37,390
warriors. The Stamford disaster sparked the
Superhuman Registration Act, which divided the

230
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:42,930
superhero community and led to the superhuman
Civil War. Only Speedball survived the blast,

231
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:47,970
though it was emotionally devastated. Believing
he deserved punishment, he rebranded himself as

232
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:53,210
the self-flatulating vigilante Penance and
joined the Thunderbolts. In the wake of this

233
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:58,550
tragedy, former Warriors member Dwayne's
half-brother, Don Yell, formed a new team of

234
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:03,170
underground vigilantes in the new Warriors'
name, composed of depowered mutants using

235
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:08,530
advanced technology. Operating outside the law,
this group struggled with internal trust issues,

236
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:13,230
especially around Don Yell's secrecy and
personal agenda to locate his brother Dwayne's

237
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:17,930
body. Their mission ultimately ended in failure
with the team disbanding after a misguided

238
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:23,230
attempt to use time travel to undo the Stamford
disaster. Meanwhile, Justice led another

239
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:28,470
iteration of the team known as Counter Force,
joined by Rage, Debris, Ultra Girl, and

240
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:33,230
Slabstick. Acting as watchdogs against the
government's initiative program, the group

241
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:38,050
eventually took back the new Warriors' name and
formed the Avengers Resistance in response to

242
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:43,430
Norman Osborn's rise to power. After Osborn's
fall, many of the members moved on to become staff

243
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:48,690
at Avengers Academy. The new Warriors would
resurface again under Justice and Speedball's

244
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:54,330
guidance as they recruited new young heroes,
including a resurrected neighbor Rita, to stop

245
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:58,750
the high-evolutionaries' plan to eliminate
superpowered beings. And that's the new

246
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:03,550
Warriors' history. For the roster, I'm going with
the original team roster, starting with the team

247
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:09,030
founder and initial leader, Night Thrasher, who
is a master martial artist, particularly with his

248
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:14,270
Escrima sticks. His bulletproof and fireproof
suit comes equipped with a variety of gadgets,

249
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:19,210
including small firearms, gas-emitting
gauntlets, incendiary explosives,

250
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:25,510
communication devices, an LED camouflage
system, infrared goggles, a glider's chute, and

251
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:31,610
most importantly, a jet-powered armored
skateboard. Next up is his first recruit, Nova,

252
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,510
who we go over in his duel against the Green
Lantern, Hal Jordan, and who has greatly enhanced

253
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:40,730
strength, able to lift over 100 tons, ability to
fly at faster-than-line speeds, and can channel

254
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:46,250
the Nova Force as extremely powerful concussive
blasts or force fields. Then on the roster, we have

255
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:52,490
Justice, who emits a telekinetic aura that he can
use to psychokinetically move objects, fly,

256
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:58,970
project concussive blasts, and erect protective
force fields. Next up is Firestar, who can tap into

257
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:04,450
the nuclear forces and surrounding atoms and
convert them into microwave radiation. She can

258
00:26:04,450 --> 00:26:10,650
use this energy to fly and can project beams of
intense heat. Following her is Neymarita, whose

259
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:15,910
human-Atlantian physiology grants her the
ability to breathe underwater and gives her

260
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:20,870
enhanced physicality, including increased
strength, able to lift 75 tons and increased

261
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:27,550
durability. She can fly with the wings on her
ankles, has limited armor, and atlantian combat

262
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:32,330
training. Last to the original team is Speedball,
whom you can learn more about in his duel against

263
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:37,830
Wally West The Flash. Speedball has a kinetic
force field that can redirect all force exerted

264
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:42,910
against him, but with greater momentum. He can
slightly extend this field to protect others in

265
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:48,490
his immediate proximity, and can hurl blasts of
kinetic energy or lend kinetic force to his

266
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:53,870
physical attacks. The last member of my New
Warriors roster has never actually been a member

267
00:26:53,870 --> 00:26:59,010
of the team, but has notoriously been associated
with them over the decades, and that's Squirrel

268
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:04,310
Girl. Comic book writer Fabian Nichieza, I think
I'm pronouncing that right, reportedly wanted

269
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:09,210
Squirrel Girl on the New Warriors team, and he
wrote her as being a huge fan of the team and having a

270
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:15,110
heavy crush on Speedball. She was also a member of
the New Warriors in the unerred pilot of the TV show

271
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:20,410
as we discussed before, so I do feel like she's a new
warrior in spirit. As detailed in her duel against

272
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:24,890
Ratcatcher, Squirrel Girl has the proportionate
physicality of a squirrel and can communicate

273
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:30,690
with the rodents. She has claws, enlarged
incisors, and advanced negotiating skills.

274
00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:36,130
That's my roster. To reiterate the New Warriors
fighting today will be Night Thrasher, Nova,

275
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:43,070
Justice, Firestar, Namorita, Speedball, and
Squirrel Girl. So right off the bat when you

276
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:50,610
started this backstory of the New Warriors, I
thought, wow, what a ripoff of Batman Night

277
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:58,310
Thrasher is. Not really. Like verbatim, almost.
What is going on? Yeah, but Night Thrasher has a

278
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:03,290
jet-powered skateboard. Does Batman? He's a
Batmobile. He doesn't need some punk-ass

279
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:10,370
skateboard. That's right. He doesn't. I didn't
know that Squirrel Girl was not a member of the New

280
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:15,790
Warriors team. I feel like when I've looked for
imagery of New Warriors, I see a lot of Squirrel

281
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:20,730
Girl. Yeah, she's associated with the team a lot of
times. So yeah, I felt comfortable adding her to

282
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:27,490
this roster. Interesting. Okay, well, let me get
into the DC team's backstory and tell you all about

283
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:34,230
Infinity Inc. Now, Infinity Inc. was formed when
several young heroes, most of them children or

284
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:39,610
heirs to members of the Justice Society of
America, were denied membership in the legendary

285
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:46,230
team, which you can learn more about in our Justice
Society vs. Fantastic Four Team Duel episode.

286
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:52,150
These hopeful young heroes included Hector Hall,
a.k .a. Silver Scarab, the son of Hawkman and

287
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:58,670
Hawkwomen, Lita Trevor, a.k .a. Fury, the
daughter of Earth Two's Wonder Woman and Steve

288
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:06,190
Trevor, Norda Candrell, a.k .a. Northwind, the
godson of Hawkman and Hawkgirl, and Albert

289
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:12,810
Rothstein, known as Nuclon or Adam Smasher. Be
sure to learn more about in our Adam Smasher vs.

290
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:20,270
Stinger Duel episode. They were later joined by
Jenny Lynn Hayden or Jade and Todd Rice, known as

291
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:27,190
Obsidian, the children of the Green Lantern, Alan
Scott. After the rejection by the JSA, the group

292
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:33,010
caught the attention of Sylvester Pemberton, the
former Star-Spangled Kid, who had once been a

293
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:38,650
youthful adventurer himself during World War II
as part of the Severance Soldiers of Victory.

294
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:45,950
Sympathetic to their cause, Pemberton left the
JSA and founded a new team with them, bringing in

295
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:51,870
additional heroes like Power Girl, Huntress, and
Brainwave Jr. The group was officially named

296
00:29:51,870 --> 00:30:17,320
Infinity Inc. and headquartered in the Infinity,
Inc. debuted publicly during a press conference

297
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,600
in which its members revealed their secret
identities and announced Hector Hall's

298
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,840
engagement to lead at Trevor. The team's first
major conflict was against the Justice Society,

299
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:33,680
who had been turned evil by the Ultra Humanite.
After subduing the JSA and defeating the Ultra

300
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,940
Humanite, who you can learn more about in his duel
against Mr. Sinister, the team established

301
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:45,040
themselves as protectors of Los Angeles,
operating under a public contract with the city.

302
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:51,160
Their dual roles as both public figures and
vigilantes brought media scrutiny as well as a

303
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:57,280
loyal fan base. The team soon clashed with Helix, a
group of metahumans created through unethical

304
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:04,740
genetic experiments. During one encounter, Fury
was kidnapped and in another, the second wildcat,

305
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:11,160
Yolanda Montez, discovered familial ties to
Helix member Karcharo. Though Helix initially

306
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:17,040
escaped one of its members, Mr. Bones, a
chain-smoking albino with transparent skin and

307
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:23,220
cyanide-laced touch, was later apprehended by
authorities. Despite his criminal past and grim

308
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:29,500
appearance, Bones expressed remorse and a desire
to change. After some hesitation, Infinity, Inc.

309
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:35,000
allowed him to join their ranks. His addition
introduced tension within the group, especially

310
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,220
due to the lethal nature of his powers, but also
reinforced the team's mission of offering

311
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:46,180
redemption and purpose to those who saw it. During
the crisis on Infinite Earths, the team played a

312
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:52,580
supporting role in the multiversal conflict and
gained three new members, the new Wildcat, a new

313
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:58,460
Our Man, and a new Dr. Midnighth named Beth
Chappell, the latter two of whom you can learn more

314
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,360
about in their respective duels against Bishop
and Falcon. Together they helped stabilize

315
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,920
collapsing realities and provided backup to the
JSA and other heroes. The team suffered a tragic

316
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:16,040
blow when Hector Hall fell under the influence of
the evil Hath Set and became a corrupted

317
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:23,540
incarnation of the Silver Scarab, wielding the
ancient Eye of Ra. After a final confrontation at

318
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:29,320
Hall Mansion, which was revealed to contain a
hidden pyramid, Hector was destroyed by the Eye's

319
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:36,140
power. Northwind and Fury left the team in the
aftermath, and Fury later reunited with Hector,

320
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:41,060
who had become the new Sandman in the Dream
Dimension. He could only return to the real world

321
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:46,480
for one hour per day, but it was enough to rekindle
their relationship. Eventually the two were

322
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,940
married and chose to live together in the Dream
Inc, severing their ties to the mortal world.

323
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:58,140
Infinity Inc experienced a devastating blow
during the wedding of Hector Hall and Lita Trevor,

324
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:03,700
when Marcy Cooper, secretly the third Harley
Quinn and a double agent working against the team,

325
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:09,920
orchestrated a lethal trap. She manipulated
events so that Skyman, Sylvester Pemberton, the

326
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:15,520
team's founder and leader, would be alone with
Solomon Grundy, a powerful and unpredictable

327
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:21,600
creature who you could learn more about in his duel
against Warwolf by Night. At the same time she

328
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:28,380
lured Mr. Bones into the room, knowing his flesh
carried a deadly touch. Under Harley Quinn's

329
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:34,180
influence Grundy grabbed Bones and forcibly
pressed his hand against Skyman, instantly

330
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:40,040
killing him. Bones, horrified at what had
happened, fled the scene. The team tracked him to

331
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:46,140
the villainous group Helix, who had taken him in
once more. But when Dr. Love, their manipulative

332
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:53,120
creator, ordered Helix to kill Bones, the group
turned on their maker and killed him instead.

333
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,920
Disillusioned, Helix disbanded, and Bones, now
free of their influence, was granted full

334
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:05,660
membership in Infinity Inc. Still, the loss of
Skyman shattered the team's foundation. With

335
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:10,820
their headquarters at Stellar Studios burned
down and their guiding force gone, the remaining

336
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:16,400
members of Infinity Inc found themselves
leaderless, directionless and overwhelmed. In

337
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:21,840
time they chose to disband, each member going
their separate way. Although the team dissolved,

338
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:28,000
their legacy lived on. Several former members of
Infinity Inc joined Black Adam's campaign to

339
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,040
liberate Condoc, forming part of his
superpowered army. Brainwave, Northwind,

340
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:40,080
Nemesis, Adam Smasher, and a host-possessed
Eclipse, aided in Black Adam's violent mission.

341
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:44,580
Though his militant assembly bore little
resemblance to the idealistic team once

342
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:51,139
headquartered in Los Angeles. In a parallel
timeline, resurrected after Infinite Crisis, a

343
00:34:51,139 --> 00:34:57,340
new Earth 2 emerged, one where the Justice Society
and Infinity Inc had merged into a single

344
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:03,300
multi-generational unit known as the Justice
Society Infinity. This version of the team

345
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:09,360
featured doppelgangers of familiar faces like
Silver Scarab, Fury, Jade, and Northwind. Unlike

346
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:16,040
their counterparts, this team operated in a world
where Alan Scott had died, Jade Carrick retired,

347
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:21,300
and Superman had vanished. Back on Earth 1,
decades after the original Infinity Inc

348
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:27,240
disbanded, the name was resurrected as part of Lux
Luthor's Everyman project to turn ordinary

349
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:33,040
citizens into superpowered crime fighters under
his control. Luthor purchased the rights to the

350
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:41,960
Infinity Inc name and identities of the lauded
superhero team composed of regular people given

351
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:47,140
metahuman abilities through a synthetic
medigene therapy. These new heroes included

352
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:55,220
Natasha Irons, known as Starlight, a new Skyman,
Nuclon, Fury, Everyman, and the Speedster,

353
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:01,820
Trajectory. The team operated as both Luthor's
personal metahuman unit and a corporate stunt,

354
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:07,660
appearing frequently in media and managing rogue
Everyman subjects. Their headquarters and

355
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:13,960
operations were largely overseen by Lexcorp
under the careful watch of Luthor and bodyguard

356
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:20,040
Mercy Graves. Though they fought threats such as
Blockbuster and Cobra operatives, the team's

357
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:25,140
darker purpose was eventually revealed when
Luthor deactivated Trajectory's powers with

358
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:31,780
flight leading to her death. He later murdered
Skyman through Everyman, who took his identity to

359
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:37,700
expose Natasha Irons as a double agent working
with her uncle, Steel. Luthor's own powers

360
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:43,400
derived from the exo-gene treatment were
nullified when Natasha used Steel's hammer to

361
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:50,300
emit an EMP, ending his control. In the wake of
Luthor's exposure, remaining members were

362
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:56,960
arrested. However, some resurfaced during World
War 3 when Ellen Scott called on them to aid in the

363
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,580
battle against Black Adam. They refused and fled
the battlefield, realizing that true heroism

364
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:10,280
required more than manufactured power. A year
after the dismantling of the Everyman project,

365
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:17,520
several of its former subjects, Natasha Irons,
Eric Strom, aka Fury, and Juro McKenna, aka

366
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:28,320
Nuclon, entered therapy to cope with the become
mist-like. Jerome could duplicate himself and

367
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:34,400
Eric manifested a dominant female alter ego.
Together with a pain-inducing psychic named

368
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:41,520
Lucia and Lex Cork bodyguard of Mercy graves, they
attempted to reform as a new Infinity Ink, now

369
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:47,400
independent of Luthor and determined to forge
their own identity. This group operated briefly

370
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,300
from a mobile base, engaging in missions while
trying to control the erratic changes in their

371
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:58,380
powers. However, they were soon targeted by a
facade of Apocalypse, who manipulated Jerome's

372
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:04,040
psyche and attempted to siphon their powers using
a specialized machine. The plant backfired when

373
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:12,020
the machine caused Infinity Ink to vanish. Steel,
arriving too late, swore to find his niece. The

374
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:17,480
team later reappeared, imprisoned in the Terror
Titans compound. The rescue was orchestrated

375
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:23,640
with the help of Miss Martian, but the reunion was
short-lived. The trauma of their experiences and

376
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:29,720
instability of their abilities left the team
scattered once more, their futures uncertain in

377
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:35,820
the wake of a legacy marked by tragedy and
reinvention. And that's the team's history. For

378
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:42,440
my Infinity Ink roster, I'm sticking with the
classic roster composed of legacy characters to

379
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:49,160
the Justice Society of America. Starting with a
former member of the JSA, the Star-Spangled Kid,

380
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:55,620
aka Skyman, who is the leader of the team for most of
its history, and whose cosmic converter belt

381
00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:01,800
grants him flight, energy projection, and
enhanced physicals. Joining him will be Silver

382
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:07,640
Scarab, the son of Hawkman and Hawkwomen, whose
Anthemetal Armor also grants him flight, energy

383
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:14,560
projection, and enhanced physicals. Silver
Scarab's wife, the Amazon known as Fury, will also

384
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:20,040
be on the team along with the twins Jade and
Obsidian, who can create constructs from light

385
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:26,600
and shadow, respectively, among other things.
Adam Smasher, who is known as Nuclon while on the

386
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:32,680
Infinity Ink team, and the second Wildcat, whose
agility and retractable claws make her a fiercer

387
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:38,600
fighter than her predecessor, will also be on this
team. So to reiterate, my roster will include

388
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:47,640
Skyman, Silver Scarab, Fury, Jade, Obsidian,
Adam Smasher, and Wildcat. So the character of

389
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:53,920
Fury we've actually seen in live action in the
Sandman television series on Netflix, right?

390
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:00,720
Yes, she was Hector Hall's wife, Lita Hall. The one
who was like dreaming about him and then like she

391
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:06,160
got pregnant? Yeah, yep, that's correct. That
actually happened in the comics as well. Well, at

392
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,440
least one of these characters has got a live action
rendition. Well, a lot of the Infinity Ink members

393
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,280
have. I'm not talking about Stargirl, no one
watched that show. Although, I don't know how many

394
00:40:15,280 --> 00:41:15,280
more people watch Sandman, so maybe I don't know
what I'm talking about. You never did. Well, now

395
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,940
that we've got the team's histories and rosters
out of the way, let's speculate on how one of the

396
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:25,160
thousands of simulated matches will go. The
winner is determined by simulations, not our

397
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:30,380
speculation, but it's fun to imagine how the fight
could play out. Agent 9K, what are the rules of our

398
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:36,120
speculation? Well, I should say there are no rules
other than the teams have no prior knowledge of the

399
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:41,480
other going into the fight. All they are aware of
starting out is that the other side is a threat that

400
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,940
needs to be eliminated. For the speculation, the
groups will begin approximately 50 meters apart

401
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:51,900
in a nondescript environment that will have no
bearing on the match itself, as no environmental

402
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:57,220
statistics are considered in my simulations. The
teams must earn victory on their own merit.

403
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:03,120
Alright then, let's get into it. Infinity Inc and
New Warriors meet on the battlefield, which team

404
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:08,300
goes first? I'm going to say Night Thrasher is
going to lead the New Warriors into battle, riding

405
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:17,080
on his skateboard, his Jeb Howard skateboard, and
he's going to do this like badass 360 spin kickflip

406
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:25,200
as he peppers the Infinity Inc team with a bunch of
sleeping gas capsules. So extreme, so badass, and

407
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,080
most if not all of Infinity Inc is knocked out and
they're just getting the shit stomped out of them

408
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:37,920
by the New Warriors. Except that, you know, when
Night Thrasher is in the air doing this so extreme

409
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,940
badass skateboard trick, before he even fires any
capsules, he's going to get snatched out of the air

410
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:51,140
by a giant sized atom smasher who's just going to
blink him right towards the horizon. Meanwhile,

411
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:57,480
Jade is going to use her chlorokinesis to have
these thorny rose vines sprout out from the ground

412
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:03,920
to beneath the New Warriors and just trap them in
place. Okay, if Pokemon has taught me anything

413
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:11,120
though, it's that Fire Beats Plant. So Firestar,
she's going to get her team out of this mess by just

414
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:16,180
burning away all the vines using focused
microwave beams, but Nova, he doesn't even need

415
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:21,240
her to do that actually, he's just going to bust out
of the vines himself and he's going to shoot atom

416
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:26,500
smasher with the Nova Force Blast that's so
powerful that it's going to send atom smasher to

417
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:32,480
the horizon in the other direction. What? So like
you just see this 100 foot tall giant man like

418
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:39,300
flailing through the air until he's out of sight.
Wow, okay. Well, Skyman, the team's leader,

419
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:45,820
noticed how Firestar is helping her team. So he's
going to take to the sky and blast her with these

420
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:51,260
stellar energy force beams that's going to knock
her to the ground. Meanwhile, Silver Scarab is

421
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:56,340
going to do the same thing to Speedball, but he's
going to blast him with a solar energy beam that's

422
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:02,780
going to burn him. Well, okay, so I'm going to say
that Speedball is going to save Firestar from

423
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:09,060
Skyman's Force Blast by leaping in the way and
redirecting the blast back at Skyman using his

424
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:16,200
kinetic field. So Skyman just knocks himself out
of the sky and since Silver Scarab was aiming his

425
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:21,080
solar beam at Speedball, Firestar is going to
return the favor by stepping in front of him and

426
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:26,340
absorbing the heat radiation. So they protected
each other, right? Defensive teamwork. They're

427
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:32,180
going to high five and everything. Okay, you know,
Skyman, he falls to the ground, but he's tough. So,

428
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:38,680
you know, he'll recover. Wildcat, meanwhile, is
going to take the fight to Squirrel Girl, landing

429
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:46,020
this combo of slashes and kicks against her while
shredding any squirrels that get near her with her

430
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:52,400
attractable claws. Geez, why the squirrels, man?
Fuck squirrels, bro. Well, Squirrel Girl has her

431
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:58,520
own claws, just like Wildcat. So Squirrel Girl
holds her own for a bit, going claw to claw. I won't

432
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:04,600
say she's as talented of a fighter as Wildcat, but I
think what she lacks in combat training, she makes

433
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:12,760
up in her speaking skills, right? So she talks to
Wildcat and gets her to hesitate in her use of

434
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:17,420
violence for just the slightest second, we'll
say. And that's when Squirrel Girl just straight

435
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:23,600
up chomps down on Wildcat's fist with her giant
front teeth and totally rendering one of

436
00:45:23,600 --> 00:45:31,100
Wildcat's hands useless. And while Wildcat's
like, oh shit, my hand, that's when she's overrun

437
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:37,820
by a squirrel stampede and she's basically chewed
to bits. Well, except the obsidian sees the

438
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:43,920
stampede coming, so he just blacks out the entire
environment. So the squirrels can't see anything

439
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:48,900
and they don't know what they're doing. But
Wildcat can see in the dark. So that's when she

440
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:55,640
lands a single devastating knockout uppercut
right to Squirrel Girl's face, just shattering

441
00:45:55,640 --> 00:46:00,760
those buck teeth right in her mouth. And you know
what the squirrel's being affected by the

442
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:06,840
nightmarish shadow land energy that obsidian has
them trapped in, they're gonna turn on Squirrel

443
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:11,920
Girl and they're gonna devour her in the
confusion. Now you can't do that. It's Squirrel

444
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:19,180
Girl. She's the unbeatable Squirrel Girl. I looks
like she is in fact beautiful because that's just

445
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:25,520
what happened. She's out. Okay, well, you know who
else could see in the dark? The marita, right? So

446
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:31,140
she goes over to obsidian, slaps him down to the
ground, which will turn the lights back on on the

447
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:37,600
battlefield, essentially. And she's gonna lift
obsidian into the air by his ankle and spin him

448
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:42,500
around and just hurl him into Jade, which sends
them both tumbling across the ground. No, I mean

449
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:47,440
Jade, you know, she'll create a green energy
construct of like a giant pillow to soften their

450
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:54,520
landing. And Fury, meanwhile, she's gonna charge
towards Namorita and tackle her out of the air once

451
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:59,980
the lights turn back on. And the two of them are
gonna trade blows. So it's Amazon versus

452
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:06,500
Atlantean. But I'm gonna say with Fury's superior
Amazonian fight training, she's gonna be able to

453
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:11,740
rip off Namorita's ankle wings. I don't think that
Amazonian training would be superior to

454
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:18,020
Atlantean training. Oh, it is. But if Fury's going
for Namorita's ankles, even if she's successful

455
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:22,080
in ripping them off, you know, looking down like
that, she's gonna miss Namorita's elbow that

456
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:28,680
comes right down on her head. That's gonna stun
her. And you know, as she's in her days, Nova flies

457
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:35,660
by like a cannon ball, just completely knocking
Fury out with a supersonic punch. So yeah, either

458
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:41,680
Fury's in a coma, or she's just a goner. And either
way, she's out of this match. Well, that's gonna

459
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:47,180
piss off Silver Scarab, you know, who probably saw
his wife get taken out. So he's gonna fly after

460
00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:54,320
Nova, just bombarding him with solar energy
beams. And while Nova is distracted by those,

461
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:59,720
that's when Adam Smasher's hand just comes out of
nowhere, slapping Nova down to the ground and

462
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:04,440
knocking him out. When did Adam Smasher get back
into this fight after being blasted to the

463
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:10,560
horizon? Well, he's been leaping back from there,
which Silver Scarab noticed. And he

464
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:15,700
intentionally directed Nova in Adam Smasher's
direction while distracting him. He's smart like

465
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:20,580
that. Okay, well, it's gonna take more than that to
take out Nova, I think, just getting slammed to the

466
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:27,100
ground. But Justice is gonna telekinetically
lift Adam Smasher's hand off of Nova. And then he's

467
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:32,680
gonna force Adam Smasher to make a fist and punch
himself right in the gonads. It's gonna make him

468
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:39,160
fall over in pain, and he's gonna feel sick and puke
in his mask. And he's gonna be out of commission for

469
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:45,260
a bit, just reeling. Meanwhile, Wildcat, she's
gonna try to hit Speedball, but like he keeps

470
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:49,920
absorbing the kinetic energy from all of her
punches that just bounced right off of him. And

471
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:55,460
then with all this kinetic energy stored up, he's
gonna run into her and slam into her, just bouncing

472
00:48:55,460 --> 00:49:00,400
her across the battlefield until she's like a mile
away. And that's probably gonna knock her out, I

473
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:04,560
would assume. But either way, she's out of this
match, because she's just too far to easily get

474
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:09,420
back regardless. Okay, but as Speedball is
running around, zipping through the

475
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:15,460
environment, that's when he's suddenly gonna
fall into Adam Smasher's giant shadow, thanks to

476
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:21,400
Obsidian. And so Speedball is now in the
Shadowlands, where he's being tormented by his

477
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:28,700
worst nightmares. So he's out of the match as well.
Oh, that wasn't a good ending for him. Okay. But by

478
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:34,500
this point, Night Thrasher has parachuted back
into the match, back from when he got thrown into

479
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:40,520
the horizon. And as he's gliding over Adam
Smasher, he's just gonna unload a few packs of

480
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:47,040
Incendiary napalm that's just gonna burn Adam
Smasher alive. So he's out. And then Night

481
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:51,260
Thrasher lands back on the ground, back on a
skateboard, actually, all extreme sports like,

482
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:57,400
and he's gonna pull out his emergency submachine
gun and just unload all of his bullets into Jade.

483
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:03,120
Nah, force field. And actually, in addition to the
force field, she's gonna create a ramp that's

484
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:08,800
gonna cause Night Thrasher to launch into the air
on a skateboard, just out of control, Williams

485
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:16,480
flailing, and he's gonna accidentally land on his
neck, snapping his spine, and he's dead. That is

486
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:21,980
not a cool way to go out. That's not extreme. Well,
while that's happening, Firestar is gonna beam

487
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:27,480
Skyman with radiation that's just gonna fry the
circuitry of his belt, and it's gonna cook him from

488
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:34,200
the inside out so that he just explodes like a baked
potato in a microwave. He's done so. Damn. Okay.

489
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:41,080
Well, while that happened, Silver Scarab, he's
gonna be cooking Namorita by bombarding her with

490
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:46,380
solar beams that are gonna dehydrate her like
really quick and just cause her body to shrivel

491
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:54,400
into a dry husk. So she's out as well. Okay. Well, I
have Justice left. He's going to telekinetically

492
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:00,740
remove Silver Scarab's armor from his body, and
then he's gonna compress all that metal into this

493
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:06,460
antmetal circular shield, kind of like Captain
America shield, and he's gonna hurl it through

494
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:12,100
Silver Scarab, just cleaving him into that
shield. What the heck? Is he like Magneto? This is

495
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:19,300
really strong metal. Now, he's telekinetic. He's
a strong telekinetic. Okay, whatever. I have Jade

496
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:26,720
and Obsidian left. So as this metal disc is flying
around, Obsidian, he's gonna open up a shadow

497
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:34,200
portal in its flight path, and the other opening is
gonna be right behind Justice so that disc is just

498
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:41,080
gonna straight up decapitate him. Oh, geez. Well,
killing Justice is gonna piss off Firestar, who's

499
00:51:41,080 --> 00:51:48,380
gonna like just burn with rage, and the radiation
aura that surrounds her is gonna turn all fiery and

500
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:53,120
white hot. So with that, she's gonna fly right
through Obsidian, just burning right through his

501
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:59,340
shadow form, since he's weak to light, and she's
gonna dissipate him from within the shadow lens.

502
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:06,620
Oh, damn. That was a good move. But I mean, you think
Firestar was pissed at Justice's death? Like

503
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:14,460
Obsidian is Jade's twin brother, so Jade is gonna
trap Firestar in this vacuum chamber, made of

504
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:20,660
solid green energy, and that's gonna quickly
remove all of the air around her, and cause

505
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:26,160
Firestar to suffocate and die. All right, so who's
left? Okay, so it's really just down to Nova and

506
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:31,620
Jade at this point, and we all know that Nova could
take a green lantern, so he's just gonna blast Jade

507
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:37,740
with a Nova Force beam that's so strong it could
punch a hole in the entire planet. So she's just

508
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:43,660
gone. Well, I mean, except that Nova can't hit what
he can't see, you know, because Jade can use her

509
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:49,380
magical light-based power to band the light
around her, making her invisible to Nova. So,

510
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:55,200
well, Nova's looking around for her. That's when
Jade's gonna channel the full power of the star

511
00:52:55,200 --> 00:53:01,360
heart into this massive, mystical, light-hot
energy beam that's gonna push Nova's force field

512
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:07,120
to the limit, and once he's drained, Jade's just
gonna pull his body apart with green energy

513
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:14,200
tendrils. Match over. Jade's not that powerful.
She can't overwhelm the Nova Force. Yeah, she is.

514
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:18,560
Like, she doesn't need a green lantern ring or like
a power battery or anything like that. She's a

515
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:25,020
direct conduit to the mystical star heart energy.
Like, she even wants to be Cain, the star heart. I

516
00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:29,940
don't know what the star heart is. Well, it's
essentially concentrated chaos magic from

517
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,480
throughout the universe. It's more powerful than
the Nova Force. That's all you need to know. You're

518
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:39,040
smoking acid right now if you think the star heart
is more powerful than the Nova Force. What?

519
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:44,700
Smoking acid? Can you do that? I don't know. Yeah,
you just put all the papers into like a smoking

520
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:50,800
paper and then you roll it up and then you smoke it
and then you say crazy things just like you did. I

521
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:57,960
don't know. I guess maybe we'll leave it there.
Either Nova blasts Jade into oblivion or she turns

522
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:04,120
invisible and blasts him into oblivion,
essentially. Let's go ahead and put the team's

523
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:17,480
statistics into our simulator and come back with a
winner. Ageninke hit it. This is a damn good

524
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:23,200
matchup. I had a lot of fun with this one, both with
the speculation and seeing just how the stats

525
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:28,460
lined up between all the characters. Of course,
Nova was the most powerful character out of either

526
00:54:28,460 --> 00:54:33,500
team. I had the most powerful character.
Jonathan, you had the least powerful character in

527
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:39,680
Wildcat. Yeah, which is kind of depressing. My
most powerful character is actually Obsidian,

528
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:45,620
which kind of makes sense to me because he was able
to take on the entire JSA like solo. Yeah, my

529
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:51,820
weakest character was actually Firestar, which
was surprising considering just how powerful she

530
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:56,480
is. But statistically, she wasn't that
impressive because other than in microwave

531
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:02,180
radiation, she didn't have a whole lot going for
her. Looking at the stat categories, it looks like

532
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:08,100
the biggest discrepancy between the two teams was
in the category of strength. And Infinity Inc had

533
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:14,400
the big advantage there. Yeah, basically all of my
guys, except for Wildcat, had enhanced strength

534
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:20,020
with Adam Smasher actually being my strongest.
Yeah, and you guys also had the advantage in

535
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:25,300
durability and versatility because my guys
weren't actually that versatile at all. I would

536
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,860
only say that Night Thrasher had a lot of
versatility. Night Thrasher was actually way

537
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:35,000
more impressive statistically than I would have
thought. Oh, for sure. I mean, you know, like he's

538
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:41,840
fast on his skateboard. He has really good armor.
He has a whole lot of weapons, including a whole lot

539
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:46,840
of explosives that could do some pretty decent
damage. And he's pretty damn smart. He was also the

540
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:51,720
best fighter on your team. Right, right, right,
right. So with all that said, Jonathan, who do you

541
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:57,520
think is winning this match? I'm worried, but I got
a root for Infinity Inc. I know you have the most

542
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:03,760
powerful character, but I have to believe that my
team is more well rounded. Our Instagram poll

543
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:11,420
takers do not agree with me. They voted in favor of
the new Warriors by 56%, which I don't know. Both

544
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:17,000
teams are pretty obscure. I'm not entirely sure
why new Warriors won out because our Instagram

545
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,300
followers are smart. That's why. But let's get the
official results. A g9k, the results, please.

546
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:32,020
Hey, you are, sir. Yeah. The winner between
Infinity Inc. And the new Warriors is Infinity

547
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:40,600
Inc. Yes. What the hell is happening here? New
Warriors, man. How did they lose? I mean, I guess it

548
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:49,920
was only by a few percentage points. Infinity Inc.
won 51% even of all of their matches, whereas the

549
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:58,160
new Warriors won 49% even. Nice. Not going to lie. I
am surprised. Like I was hoping that Infinity Inc.

550
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:03,420
was going to win. I did not actually expect it to
happen, though, especially considering it looks

551
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:11,920
like Nova's win rate was a whopping 87.6%. That's
insane. Yeah. He won most of his matches. Really.

552
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:18,880
None of my guys had a bad win rate. Even my weakest
characters still won about a third of It really

553
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:24,340
looks like Jade and Obsidian carried my team for
the most part. Both of them had really high win

554
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:30,920
percentages, though I also had the lowest win
percentage with Wildcat. She only won 18.3% of her

555
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:37,120
matches. Everyone else was about middle of the
road around 50%. Well, the new Warriors may have

556
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:43,280
lost, but they are still the better team because
they have that cool factor. Infinity Inc. is

557
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:49,220
probably the least cool superhero team I have ever
seen or heard of. What the hell are you talking

558
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:54,520
about? They have no style, no thematic through
line, none of the things that make a team cool. So

559
00:57:54,520 --> 00:58:01,560
how does new Warriors have a stronger thematic
through line than a legacy team like Infinity

560
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:10,100
Inc.? Well, look at Night Thrasher. Total badass.
Nova. Total badass. Speedball. Really awesome.

561
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:14,360
Same thing with Justice Firestar and Namerita.
They're all like the rock stars of the Marvel

562
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:21,760
Universe. So while we may not have won this match,
at least we have that going for us. Again, CAT scan,

563
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:59,640
bro. CAT scan. That does it for this duel, guys.
HN9K, help close this out. Our next episode is

564
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:06,580
going to be another duel episode, just an
individual duel between Elongated and Medusa. We

565
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:13,020
have a guy who can stretch his body versus a chick
who can stretch her hair. So it's going to be really

566
00:59:13,020 --> 00:59:18,480
stretchy and a lot of fun. Yeah, I can't wait. That
does it for this episode. We want to give a big
