00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,963
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:29,731
Welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:35,673
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:36,053 --> 00:00:42,395
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous
Joe. And in this episode, we're doing a duel

5
00:00:42,675 --> 00:00:50,237
between two evil Superman-type characters from
alternate dimensions, Ultraman against Hyperion.

6
00:00:50,637 --> 00:00:55,940
Hyperion's not evil. What are you talking about?
It wasn't he like a bad guy for a while. No,

7
00:00:56,301 --> 00:01:01,845
he's like he's misguided sometimes. We'll just
say that. But he's a hero. Pretty sure in supreme

8
00:01:01,865 --> 00:01:08,851
power, he was bad. That was the even Marvel
continuity. Those Marvel Max. OK. Anyway, Hyperion's

9
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:13,395
a good guy, and he's going to beat the shit
out of Ultraman. That's all you need to know.

10
00:01:13,895 --> 00:01:20,361
And all you need to know is I got I don't know.
I got nothing. I'll think of something later

11
00:01:20,421 --> 00:01:24,655
on in this episode. Before that, we're going
to break down the comic book movie news from

12
00:01:24,675 --> 00:01:29,620

39
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:09,975
to the no prize! A No Prize is an award Marvel
used to give out to fans. Our version, the

40
00:04:10,015 --> 00:04:14,816
Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award we
post on Instagram for the person that we feel

41
00:04:14,856 --> 00:04:19,958
gave the best answer to our question of the
week. Last week we asked, who is your favorite

42
00:04:20,058 --> 00:04:25,999
villain from a Marvel or DC television series
and why? And this is coming off the news that

43
00:04:26,059 --> 00:04:31,221
Wilson Bethel will be returning as Bullseye
in the Daredevil Born Again Disney Plus series

44
00:04:31,261 --> 00:04:35,758
next year. We got quite a few answers. So let's
break down the honorable mentions before revealing

45
00:04:35,798 --> 00:04:41,841
this week's no prize winner. Our first honorable
mention goes to... Miggy Mathengian, who said...

46
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:48,584
Hey what's up guys, it's Miggy. My favorite
DC TV villain is Eivartan from The Flash Season

47
00:04:48,744 --> 00:04:53,966
1. I think his motivation was pretty unique
because he just wanted to get home, so you

48
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:59,268
can sympathize with that while still disliking
his methods. Also his relationship with the

49
00:05:00,088 --> 00:05:05,599
protagonist was also very unique because it
started out out of pure resentment, but it

50
00:05:05,659 --> 00:05:11,563
evolved into a love-hate mentorship. Thanks
guys. Yeah, Eobard Thawne was the reverse Flash

51
00:05:11,664 --> 00:05:18,148
antagonist in the Flash CW series. Now the character
was played by multiple actors over the course

52
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:23,912
of the series, namely Tom Kavanaugh and Matt
Letcher, but every time he was on screen, he

53
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:29,016
was a force to be reckoned with. He was just
pure evil in how much he wanted to bring down

54
00:05:29,276 --> 00:05:33,227
the series protagonist Barry Allen. Yeah, I
never watched The Flash show, but it seemed

55
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:38,112
like Reverse Flash was the best out of all the
villains that were on all the seasons. Yeah,

56
00:05:38,152 --> 00:05:43,978
I didn't watch the whole thing, but I did watch
the final battle of the final episode and that

57
00:05:43,998 --> 00:05:48,222
was pretty cool. It was really cool to see the
Reverse Flash and all the other speedsters

58
00:05:48,242 --> 00:05:52,686
that The Flash had gone up against throughout
the series in that episode. Great answer, Miggy.

59
00:05:52,726 --> 00:05:59,146
Our next honorable mention goes to Travis Herndon,
who said, Hey guys, Travis here. So my answer

60
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:04,868
would have to be Bushmaster from Luke Cage Season
2. I think he was an amazing villain, had a

61
00:06:04,908 --> 00:06:11,030
tragic backstory, an interesting power set.
I really love him as an antagonist and a villain

62
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,771
and seeing that fight, that main fight between
him and Luke Cage was cool as well as them

63
00:06:15,811 --> 00:06:21,693
teaming up really makes me wish that he could
have stayed as sort of a new partner for Luke

64
00:06:21,713 --> 00:06:27,138
Cage in Season 3, but hey, what will he do?
Yeah, Bushmaster in season two of Luke Cage

65
00:06:27,198 --> 00:06:33,080
was incredible. He had a great backstory and
he was quite the formidable challenge for Luke

66
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,141
Cage. Like he totally whipped his ass early
on in that season. And then, you know, Luke

67
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:40,882
Cage had to grow as a character in order to
finally face him again. The Luke Cage television

68
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:46,403
show had some great villains across its two
season run. Like in the first season, you had

69
00:06:46,543 --> 00:06:51,625
Cottonmouth and Black Mariah. Although you also
had Diamondback, which really sucked. But like

70
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:56,267
season two had no such villain problem. because
Bushmaster was just phenomenal. And Black Mariah

71
00:06:56,288 --> 00:07:01,692
was phenomenal too. Yeah, Luke Cage season two
is like one of the most underrated, I think,

72
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:07,236
seasons of superhero television in existence.
I feel like not enough people saw that, and

73
00:07:07,336 --> 00:07:12,621
it was really good. In part, thanks to Bushmaster,
fantastic villain. Great answer, Travis. Our

74
00:07:12,661 --> 00:07:19,066
next honorable mention goes to Judson Batty,
who said. Hi guys, Judson Batty here. I think

75
00:07:19,126 --> 00:07:27,024
that the best villain from a Marvel or DC project,
show is Deathstroke from Arrow season two.

76
00:07:27,284 --> 00:07:34,189
He was played incredibly well with subtleties
that made the performance never get boring.

77
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,253
He was recognizable as the character from the
comics and made a hero as selfless as Green

78
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:43,976
Arrow for his own life and not just that of
those around him, which is quite an impressive

79
00:07:44,016 --> 00:07:49,540
feat. Yeah, Deathstroke has been the villain
of a number of television seasons, including

80
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:54,644
like Titan season two. but he was never more
frightening and more effectively used than

81
00:07:54,704 --> 00:08:02,030
in Arrow Season 2. The fact that you set up
this character of Slade as being an ally of

82
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:07,435
the main character Oliver Queen throughout Season
1, only to see that relationship deteriorate

83
00:08:07,475 --> 00:08:11,558
in the Season 2 flashbacks, and just see the
consequences of everything that happened on

84
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:17,884
the island in the present day, it was terrifying.
He was like a great monster movie character,

85
00:08:17,924 --> 00:08:22,146
almost like Michael Myers or something like
that, but like... smart and just deadly and

86
00:08:22,206 --> 00:08:27,168
fast, really wicked, really awesome, fantastic
answer. We want to give a quick shout out to

87
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:31,849
Colby Hentges and Scott Camacho for taking the
time to visit our website and leave their answers

88
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:38,531
as well. But the winner of this week's Snow
Prize is Alex Fowler who said, What is up,

89
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:43,452
gentlemen? This is Alex Fowler, huge fan, been
listening for a long time. My favorite depiction

90
00:08:43,492 --> 00:08:49,502
of a villain in a Marvel or DC series. I'm a
DC fan, but I've got to say. Vincent D'Onofrio's

91
00:08:49,542 --> 00:08:56,644
depiction of Kingpin in Daredevil is just great.
He's complex. You understand why he is the

92
00:08:56,664 --> 00:09:01,925
way he is. He's depicted intensely. He's just
great, guys. You know what? You guys are doing

93
00:09:01,965 --> 00:09:09,287
a great job. Keep up the great work. Huge, huge
fan. Take care. Bye-bye. Yeah, I mean, this

94
00:09:09,327 --> 00:09:14,989
is the answer, right? Vincent D'Onofrio's Kingpin
so epitomizes the character and I think even

95
00:09:15,049 --> 00:09:19,438
enhances what everybody's perception of him
was from the comics. You know, Kingpin was

96
00:09:19,478 --> 00:09:23,740
always the fat bald guy who for some reason
could go toe to toe with Spider-Man. I think

97
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:29,662
watching Vincent D'Onofrio's intensity as he
plays the character, not only in Daredevil

98
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:33,924
seasons 1 through 3, but also I think in the
recent Echo television series, the character

99
00:09:33,944 --> 00:09:39,626
is so believable, so threatening. Vincent D'Onofrio
is phenomenal. Yeah, I'm a DC fan just like

100
00:09:39,726 --> 00:09:45,268
Alex, and even I admit that Vincent D'Onofrio
was like born to play Kingpin. It's a sight

101
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:49,351
to behold. And there's not much more to say
about it than that. Great answer, Alex. You

102
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:53,397
win this week's No Prize. If you the listener
want a shot at winning your own No Prize, stay

103
00:09:53,417 --> 00:09:57,522
tuned to later on this episode when we'll be
asking another question of the week. And now

104
00:09:57,562 --> 00:09:59,545
that that's done, onto the news.

105
00:10:04,974 --> 00:10:11,255
Okay, so a few weeks ago we learned that the
finalists for the casting of Laura Zor-El,

106
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:19,438
aka Supergirl, in James Gunn's DC Cinematic
Universe was down to McDonaldi from some Disney

107
00:10:19,618 --> 00:10:26,120
zombie TV show and Millie Alcock from HBO's
House of the Dragon. And it's been revealed

108
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:32,718
that Millie has won the role of Supergirl, beating
out McDonaldi. Not gonna lie. I was actually

109
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:37,702
rooting for McDonaldy for the role. And this
is probably because my daughters have watched

110
00:10:37,782 --> 00:10:42,366
that zombie Disney television series. So I was
familiar with her. I haven't seen House of

111
00:10:42,386 --> 00:10:47,410
the Dragon yet, but now I know I definitely
need to because I've heard great things about

112
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:52,454
Millie Alcock's performance in that even though
she's only in two episodes of the series. But

113
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:56,638
yeah, she's our super girl. And all I want to
know is how the heck did like this eight year

114
00:10:56,698 --> 00:11:02,062
old get this part? Right. Not going to lie.
That was my first reaction to. Apparently though,

115
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:09,265
she's 23 years old. She looks 12, but she's
23. She's 5'5". You know, I've seen some fan

116
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:14,887
art, some better than others, where she looks
fairly decent as the character. Not as good

117
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:19,389
as McDonnelly, but I'm not gonna hold that against
her, because again, she's supposedly a fantastic

118
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:24,391
actress. And I like the fact that James Gunn
would choose the better actress over the more

119
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:29,798
comics accurate depiction, I guess you could
say. She's like the female Will Poulter. She

120
00:11:29,818 --> 00:11:35,742
looks exactly like Will Poulter. You know who
you look exactly like? You? That's fair, I

121
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:41,607
shouldn't say anything else then. Ha ha ha.
To be fair, I stole the Will Poulter line from

122
00:11:41,807 --> 00:11:46,211
Meggie on the Discord channel. That's what he
said and it cracked me up because it's true.

123
00:11:47,512 --> 00:11:53,737
She just does not look like Supergirl to me
and I'm really thinking that we may need to

124
00:11:53,777 --> 00:11:59,978
realign our expectations for this role. She
may not look like Supergirl. but she may act

125
00:11:59,998 --> 00:12:04,340
like Supergirl. And according to some of the
scans I've seen from the woman of tomorrow

126
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:10,042
trade paperback, the character is a total badass.
Oh yeah, Supergirl in that comic series is

127
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:16,545
a very hard edged character. And maybe Millie
Alcock has that hard edge to her that the other

128
00:12:16,605 --> 00:12:22,088
actresses did not. Ultimately, she's the lead
in a film that is probably gonna be really,

129
00:12:22,128 --> 00:12:28,126
really expensive to make. So I hope they put
their chips in the right hand. But I'm optimistic

130
00:12:28,167 --> 00:12:34,171
because so far the rest of the other casting
in the DCU has been spot on. Yeah, Millie Alcock

131
00:12:34,191 --> 00:12:39,656
might be all, you know, 5'5 and look like she's
a teenager, but I will also admit that she

132
00:12:39,716 --> 00:12:45,100
also looks feisty and like she could kick some
ass if she needs to. We've recently seen Supergirl

133
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,745
in quite a few projects as of late, including
the Supergirl television series and the Flash

134
00:12:50,805 --> 00:12:55,409
movie. So Millie Alcock has some big shoes to
fill. And that brings us to our question of

135
00:12:55,449 --> 00:12:55,789
the week.

136

award that person a Dynamic Duel No Prize that

141
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:28,210
we'll post to Instagram. Be sure to answer before
February 10th. In Marvel News, we learned this

142
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:33,992
past week that the Thunderbolts has cast two
new roles in the film, including Geraldine

143
00:13:34,052 --> 00:13:40,435
Viswanathan. We're not quite sure who she's
playing yet, but it appears that Lewis Pullman

144
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:46,458
has nabbed the role of Robert Reynolds, aka
The Sentry, taking over the spot that was left

145
00:13:46,498 --> 00:13:52,420
behind by Steven Yeun. Now Lewis Pullman is
an actor that I'm not too familiar with other

146
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:58,230
than his parentage. He is the son of Bill Pullman.
who we all know as the badass president from

147
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:03,092
Independence Day, and also while you were sleeping.
And a bunch of other great stuff. Bill Pullman's

148
00:14:03,112 --> 00:14:08,655
a great actor. His son, I'm hoping, is great
as well. He was in Top Gun Maverick, and he

149
00:14:08,675 --> 00:14:13,617
was also in Bad Times at the El Royale, and
recently Lessons in Chemistry with Brie Larson.

150
00:14:14,077 --> 00:14:18,859
I saw parts of all three of those, and I don't
remember him. Well, you're gonna remember him

151
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:23,801
now that he's playing the Sentry. He looks the
part, you know, he looks the part of Bob Reynolds,

152
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:27,810
I should say, maybe not necessarily the Sentry.
It will be interesting to see him bulked out

153
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:32,492
with like golden flowing hair and stuff like
that. But you know, he has time to bulk up

154
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:37,314
if he needs to. I don't know if they're going
to go for like the drug addict Rob Reynolds

155
00:14:37,354 --> 00:14:41,936
look or the totally shredded sentry, but we'll
see. Whatever actor was going to play the sentry

156
00:14:41,996 --> 00:14:46,938
needed to convincingly convey both a light and
a dark side, considering the sentry's dark

157
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:53,041
shadow self is the void. So it's really a dual
role here. Do we know what character Geraldine

158
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:58,299
Viswanathan is going to play? No, but she did
replace Ayo Adabiri, who had to depart the

159
00:14:58,319 --> 00:15:03,361
project due to scheduling issues, just like
Steven Yeun. Cool. This is like the most boring

160
00:15:03,401 --> 00:15:07,322
casting announcement ever. It's like a whole
bunch of people we don't know playing roles

161
00:15:07,342 --> 00:15:11,464
that we aren't sure about. What are you talking
about? We know who the Sentry is. Yeah, but

162
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:15,965
I mean, the Sentry is not that cool. Do you
want to die? I mean, we all die someday.

163
00:15:19,394 --> 00:15:22,876
Sentry is badass, you don't know what you're
talking about. And I think this is pretty interesting

164
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:27,300
news. I'm looking forward to seeing how Lewis
Pullman plays the character. You know what

165
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:34,505
we need? We need like some fucking costume tests.
Like we're getting casting news without costume

166
00:15:34,545 --> 00:15:39,329
tests. I wanna see these people in the roles.
Kevin Feige and James Gunn, come on. Well,

167
00:15:39,349 --> 00:15:43,852
maybe we'll get some news at this year's San
Diego Comic-Con. I bet this year's Comic-Con

168
00:15:43,932 --> 00:15:49,076
is gonna be so cool. Like I'm looking forward
to it more than I have in a long time. It's

169
00:15:49,236 --> 00:15:52,458
because there's only a few movies coming out
this year. So there's a lot more to look forward

170
00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:56,261
to in the coming years than there is this year.
Yeah, the sooner we get through this year,

171
00:15:56,321 --> 00:16:03,486
the better, man, for real. Let's just fast forward
2024. Just have a ton of fun because time flies,

172
00:16:03,506 --> 00:16:08,429
apparently. No, I'm looking forward to Deadpool
three. Better be lots of fun. It will be. We

173
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:09,009
all know it will be.

174
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:19,728
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and move into

175
00:16:19,828 --> 00:16:25,952
our main event where we find out who would win
in a fight between the Crime Syndicate's Ultraman

176
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:28,813
versus the Squadron Supremes Hyperion.

177
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:50,481
Alright, Ultraman versus Hyperion. Ultraman
of course is the evil Earth 3 counterpart to

178
00:16:50,581 --> 00:16:57,645
Superman and Hyperion is the Superman, one of
many Superman counterparts in Marvel. You've

179
00:16:57,665 --> 00:17:02,668
got Hyperion, you've got Gladiator, you've got
the Sentry, you've got a whole bunch of people

180
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:07,330
because Marvel's a big ripoff company. I mean
not really though if you think about it. I

181
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:14,418
just did and I just revealed that was true.
Now Hyperion is cool. He's the leader of the

182
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:20,520
Squadron Supreme, who is a team that had a fantastic
run in the mid-1980s, even before Watchmen

183
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:26,221
came out, that really started to break down
and deconstruct the superhero mythos. And really

184
00:17:26,241 --> 00:17:31,383
what Marvel was doing was they were trying to
tell the story using these DC character archetypes

185
00:17:31,523 --> 00:17:38,105
to explore what would it be like if they were
more authoritarian and really do things that

186
00:17:38,305 --> 00:17:42,838
DC couldn't really do with their IP at the time.
And really, it was a huge influence, I think,

187
00:17:42,858 --> 00:17:48,260
to Alan Moore's Watchmen, who told a similar
story, but those characters were more analogs

188
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:54,361
to the Charlton characters, but fantastic stories.
You know, I knew about the Squadron Supreme

189
00:17:54,421 --> 00:17:58,562
legacy as being something like that. I didn't
realize it came before Watchmen, though. I'll

190
00:17:58,582 --> 00:18:03,324
have to read it. It's good. It's really good.
I'll definitely go into major spoilers about

191
00:18:03,344 --> 00:18:08,125
that story within my Hyperion background, but
I hope it'll convince a lot of people to check

192
00:18:08,145 --> 00:18:13,397
it out. Yeah, there's... several versions of
Hyperion, right? Correct, yeah. So there was

193
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:18,801
the original Hyperion from the Squadron Supreme,
there was Hyperion from Squadron Sinister,

194
00:18:19,162 --> 00:18:24,626
which was an evil doppelganger version of Squadron
Supreme, then there was also Supreme Powers

195
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:29,190
Hyperion, which was a line in the Marvel Max
imprint, and then two other Hyperions found

196
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:34,735
their way to the Marvel Primary 616 universe.
I don't think we've mentioned this yet, but

197
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:39,138
this is actually a multiversal duel. That's
the whole reason why we're doing this. Oh yes,

198
00:18:39,198 --> 00:18:46,180
so of course Ultraman was in the recent Justice
League Crisis on Infinite Earths Part 1 animated

199
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,663
film. We were supposed to review that after
Echo, so this is a tie into that. But also,

200
00:18:51,823 --> 00:18:56,725
you know, between Crisis on Infinite Earths
and Madame Web, we were looking to do these

201
00:18:56,765 --> 00:19:01,587
multiversal duels. So this is one of them. Yeah,
we've done several multiversal duels over the

202
00:19:01,628 --> 00:19:07,133
course of this show, including Batman Beyond
vs. Spider-Man 2099, Cosmic Gross Rider vs.

203
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:12,297
The Batman Who Laughs, and we've done Kingdom
Come Superman vs. Maestro. So it's always neat

204
00:19:12,337 --> 00:19:18,143
to explore these universes outside of the primary
Marvel and DC continuity. Yeah, and we'll do

205
00:19:18,203 --> 00:19:23,347
so in the characters' backstories. Before that,
let's go to our sentient duel simulator, Alfred

206
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:30,155
Jarvis 9000. AJ 9K. Tell our listeners how you
go about determining a winner in our dual matchups.

207
00:19:31,076 --> 00:19:35,377
Yes, of course, sir. The way I determine a winner
between the contestants is by running 1000

208
00:19:35,858 --> 00:19:41,540
Monte Carlo simulations using the characters
statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic

209
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:47,122
model used to determine outcomes through random
sampling. In this case, I randomize the statistics

210
00:19:47,162 --> 00:19:51,844
along a normal distribution as a way to simulate
the many variables that can occur during battle.

211
00:19:52,244 --> 00:19:56,999
The stat parameters are based on the official
Marvel power grid. from which the DC characters'

212
00:19:57,019 --> 00:20:02,203
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat
categories are included, such as range, damage

213
00:20:02,223 --> 00:20:07,648
potential, versatility, and perception, in order
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.

214
00:20:08,128 --> 00:20:12,932
The results of the 1,000 simulations provide
a percentage of wins for each character. The

215
00:20:12,972 --> 00:20:17,436
contestant with the higher percentage is declared
the victor, as they have a higher probability

216
00:20:17,476 --> 00:20:23,261
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,
neither character should win 100% of the matches.

217
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:28,279
The comic book stories have shown that there's
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so

218
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:32,181
the confidence rate of my method falls in line
with the precedents that have been established

219
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:37,784
in the source material. My mathematical simulations
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are

220
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:42,165
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes
tabulated for determination of the winner.

221
00:20:43,586 --> 00:20:48,127
Thanks AJ9K, before we run the simulations though,
we'd like to break down each character's histories

222
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:53,190
and abilities before improvising a scenario
on how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations

223
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:58,252
would play out beat for beat. And I believe
it's my turn to go first with the Marvel backstory,

224
00:20:58,312 --> 00:21:04,334
so let me go ahead and tell you all about Hyperion.
Beyond the Earth-616 mainstream Marvel universe,

225
00:21:04,774 --> 00:21:11,437
an adjacent reality known as Earth-712 was the
home of a team of superheroes called the Squadron

226
00:21:11,497 --> 00:21:17,519
Supreme. The team was led by a hero named Hyperion,
who was the last surviving member of a race

227
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:23,500
of Eternals whose planet had died. Sent to live
on Earth as a baby, Hyperion was raised by

228
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:29,162
a loving family who named him Mark Milton, and
instilled a strong moral code. Growing up as

229
00:21:29,182 --> 00:21:34,563
the hero Hyperion, he moved to Cosmopolis, where
he worked at a newspaper as a cartoonist, and

230
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:40,425
fell in love with reporter Lonnie Latimer. During
his career as a superhero, he befriended fellow

231
00:21:40,485 --> 00:21:47,729
adventurer Nighthawk, aka Batman, and the two
joined forces with Power Princess, aka Wonder

232
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:56,394
Woman, Amphibian, aka Aquaman, the Blur, aka
Flash, Dr. Spectrum, aka Green Lantern, and

233
00:21:56,494 --> 00:22:03,298
the Skrull hero Skymax, aka Martian Manhunter,
to form the Squadron Supreme. Together, they

234
00:22:03,338 --> 00:22:07,821
were the world's finest protectors, rising to
fight and defeat any threat to planet Earth.

235
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:13,505
In one adventure, The elder of the universe
known as the Grandmaster created an evil duplicate

236
00:22:13,545 --> 00:22:19,009
of the team and called it the Squadron Sinister.
In a cosmic wager against a variant of the

237
00:22:19,029 --> 00:22:23,693
villain King the Conqueror, the Grandmaster
pit the Squadron Sinister against Earth-616's

238
00:22:24,714 --> 00:22:31,099
Avengers in a contest of champions. The Avengers
won the battle. Like, super easily mind you.

239
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:36,386
Bullshiiiit. And though the Grandmaster and
King's bet was over, The Avengers later found

240
00:22:36,406 --> 00:22:42,989
themselves accidentally transported to Earth-712,
where they met the Squadron Supreme. After

241
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:47,431
a brief misunderstanding where they confused
them for the Squadron Sinister, the two teams

242
00:22:47,471 --> 00:22:52,533
eventually joined forces to defeat a mutant
villain named Brainchild, before the Avengers

243
00:22:52,613 --> 00:22:58,015
returned to their home reality. Later, the Squadron
became mind-controlled by an evil entity known

244
00:22:58,095 --> 00:23:03,510
as Overmind, and the team ravaged the United
States into an apocalyptic state. However,

245
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:08,774
Earth-616's Defenders team were able to travel
to their dimension and free the Squadron and

246
00:23:08,814 --> 00:23:14,139
combine their might to defeat Overmind. The
Defenders then returned to their home reality,

247
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:20,605
but Earth-712's America was left in chaos. You
can learn more about King the Conqueror and

248
00:23:20,625 --> 00:23:24,688
his duel against Professor Zoom, more about
the Avengers and their duel against the Justice

249
00:23:24,728 --> 00:23:29,393
League, and more about the Defenders and their
duel against the Suicide Squad. With the United

250
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:34,543
States falling apart, Hyperion and his teammates
decided that with their combined knowledge

251
00:23:34,563 --> 00:23:40,506
and power, they could restore the country and
transform it into a utopia. The team declared

252
00:23:40,646 --> 00:23:46,509
martial law and usurped the US government, implementing
a series of sweeping changes that included

253
00:23:46,609 --> 00:23:51,691
a behavior modification program to inhibit the
criminal instincts of prison inmates. They

254
00:23:51,771 --> 00:23:57,534
also destroyed all firearms and replaced them
with personal force field devices, and developed

255
00:23:57,714 --> 00:24:02,796
medical cryogenic technology to preserve those
who were near death until such time they could

256
00:24:02,836 --> 00:24:07,298
be restored to health. Though the squadron's
reforms successfully turned the planet into

257
00:24:07,318 --> 00:24:12,480
a paradise without crime, poverty, and sickness,
their new system of order was not without its

258
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:18,543
setbacks. The hero known as the Golden Archer,
aka Green Arrow, was removed from the team

259
00:24:18,683 --> 00:24:23,525
after it was discovered he was using the behavior
modification process to brainwash his teammate

260
00:24:23,625 --> 00:24:30,047
Lady Lark aka Black Canary, to fall in love
with him. Nuke, aka Firestorm, went on a crazed

261
00:24:30,087 --> 00:24:34,829
rampage after learning the radiation from his
body had killed his parents, forcing the Squadron

262
00:24:34,869 --> 00:24:39,430
to kill him. Several members left the Squadron
after becoming disgusted with its methods,

263
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:45,012
including Amphibian and Nighthawk, the latter
of whom created his own team of heroes and

264
00:24:45,052 --> 00:24:50,282
former villains called the Redeemers who would
rise to oppose the Squadron. The two groups

265
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:56,028
clashed in a brutal fight in which several members
on each side were killed. When Hyperion saw

266
00:24:56,148 --> 00:25:01,653
Nighthawk perish in the battle, he became horrified
at what was happening and realized that his

267
00:25:01,713 --> 00:25:06,598
late friend was right. That although their intentions
were good, the Squadron Supreme had become

268
00:25:06,658 --> 00:25:12,083
dictators in a totalitarian state of their own
creation. They surrendered control of the US

269
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:17,015
back to the government and the team disbanded.
Shortly after, Hyperion recruited the remaining

270
00:25:17,055 --> 00:25:23,237
members of the squadron to save Earth-712 from
the Nth Man, aka Phantom Stranger, who was

271
00:25:23,317 --> 00:25:28,620
inadvertently nullifying dimensions he was traveling
through. Several members of the squadron died

272
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,842
trying to stop him, though they ultimately were
successful. Hyperion, however, ended up stranded

273
00:25:33,862 --> 00:25:39,064
alongside several other squadron members in
the Earth-616 reality for a time, where he

274
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:44,467
ended up occasionally partnering with the Avengers.
Eventually Hyperion and his fellow teammates

275
00:25:44,547 --> 00:25:49,250
found a way back to their home reality, where
they found that in the absence of the Squadron,

276
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:55,333
the world governments had formed a global directorate
that were using the technology of the Squadron's

277
00:25:55,494 --> 00:26:01,057
old Utopia project for themselves. The founding
members of the Squadron Supreme banded together

278
00:26:01,157 --> 00:26:06,180
once again, along with the son of the original
Nyhawk and a team of dimension-hopping heroes

279
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:11,496
called the Exiles. Together they battled and
defeated the global directorate, returning

280
00:26:11,576 --> 00:26:16,741
freedom to the world, and allowing society to
progress democratically and without superhuman

281
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:22,406
involvement. Unfortunately, all of Earth-712
came to an end, however, when realities in

282
00:26:22,446 --> 00:26:28,131
the Marvel multiverse began colliding and destroying
each other in a series of cataclysmic incursions.

283
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:33,837
Hyperion became his universe's only survivor,
floating in the void left where his dimension

284
00:26:33,897 --> 00:26:40,387
was destroyed. There, he was discovered by AIM
scientists from Earth-616 who held him in captivity

285
00:26:40,527 --> 00:26:45,608
until he was rescued by the Avengers and joined
their ranks for a time as they tried to stop

286
00:26:45,648 --> 00:26:51,550
the incursions. After the events of the secret
wars that rebuilt the multiverse, Hyperion

287
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:57,092
formed a new squadron supreme composed of heroes
who had also survived their own universe's

288
00:26:57,172 --> 00:26:59,132
destruction. And that's his backstory.

289
00:27:03,394 --> 00:27:09,077
capable of absorbing cosmic radiation and channeling
it like a nuclear reactor for a variety of

290
00:27:09,117 --> 00:27:15,000
effects. This includes vastly enhanced durability
and strength, able to lift well in excess of

291
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:20,703
100 tons. He can fly and move at hypersonic
speeds, and has superhuman senses including

292
00:27:20,763 --> 00:27:26,206
hearing, smell, and sight, able to see in all
wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum

293
00:27:26,326 --> 00:27:32,109
like infrared and x-rays. He can also fire beams
of intense radiation from his eyes called atomic

294
00:27:32,169 --> 00:27:38,011
vision. In addition to his physical attributes,
he is a capable leader and an experienced combatant.

295
00:27:38,511 --> 00:27:44,773
He has only one weakness, and that is to Argonite,
a substance native to his birth planet. Which

296
00:27:44,813 --> 00:27:49,214
is named Argon? It's never named actually. I
guess you could assume that his birth planet

297
00:27:49,254 --> 00:27:54,656
was Argon or Argo. Friggin no shame. How are
you with the fact that you're essentially using

298
00:27:54,696 --> 00:27:59,397
a DC character in this match? I don't know what
you're talking about. I hope it feels good.

299
00:28:00,017 --> 00:28:07,071
How do you figure? Hyperion is basically a DC
character. I don't see it. Cosmopolis, Argonite,

300
00:28:07,631 --> 00:28:15,793
Atomic Vision. You totally lost me, man. Alright.
Well, let me move on to Ultraman. Within the

301
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:21,635
DC multiverse, there exists a universe that
is a dark reflection of DC's Prime Universe,

302
00:28:21,935 --> 00:28:27,317
in which heroes became villains and villains
became heroes. In this universe, the planet

303
00:28:27,357 --> 00:28:35,255
Krypton never exploded, The infant son of the
Kryptonian criminal, Jir-Lil, was rocketed

304
00:28:35,295 --> 00:28:40,876
from the planet to Earth, encountering Kryptonite
adrift in space along the way, which empowered

305
00:28:40,916 --> 00:28:46,678
the infant in this universe rather than weakening
him. Gaining new powers each time he encountered

306
00:28:46,718 --> 00:28:52,679
the smallest fragment of Kryptonite, the Kryptonian
grew to become a superpower despot known as

307
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:58,481
Ultraman. During his conquest and destruction,
he encountered four other powerful and tyrannical

308
00:28:58,521 --> 00:29:05,945
beings, Overpowering and Johnny Quick and together
they joined to form the Crime Syndicate of

309
00:29:06,005 --> 00:29:11,628
America Able to overpower any resistance the
Crime Syndicate conquered most of the world

310
00:29:11,748 --> 00:29:16,391
with Ultraman gaining new powers Every time
they encountered new stashes of Kryptonite

311
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:22,435
on Earth Eventually Ultraman gained a new type
of supervision that allowed him to see into

312
00:29:22,555 --> 00:29:28,397
other universes Setting his sights on Earth's
one and two the home dimensions of the Justice

313
00:29:28,457 --> 00:29:33,058
League and Justice Society, respectively. You
can learn more about the Justice League and

314
00:29:33,098 --> 00:29:38,281
Justice Society in their team duel episodes
against the Avengers and Fantastic Four. Eager

315
00:29:38,321 --> 00:29:42,503
to test the strength of the crime syndicate
against the champions from these other worlds,

316
00:29:42,663 --> 00:29:48,445
Ultraman and his allies nonetheless proved themselves
incapable of overpowering the combined might

317
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:54,728
of the heroes from Earths 1 and 2. Ultraman
himself fell after the heroes of Earth 1 exposed

318
00:29:54,768 --> 00:30:00,251
him to a chunk of kryptonite so large, his body
went into a paralytic shock after the acquisition

319
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:05,033
of so many new powers. which eventually wore
off. Ultraman and the crime syndicate were

320
00:30:05,073 --> 00:30:10,635
imprisoned by Green Lantern in an interdimensional
prison between universes, though they eventually

321
00:30:10,715 --> 00:30:17,037
escaped and Ultraman was rescued by Lex Luthor
and Alexi Luthor of Earths 1 and 2 in order

322
00:30:17,077 --> 00:30:23,839
to kill the supermen of their worlds. With the
help of Alexander Luthor Sr. of Earth 3, a

323
00:30:23,899 --> 00:30:26,400
hero, the supermen were able to defeat and

324
00:30:30,238 --> 00:30:36,442
Eventually, a wave of antimatter tore through
the DC Multiverse, destroying entire universes.

325
00:30:36,923 --> 00:30:43,288
Though the Crime Syndicate teamed up with Alexander
Luther Sr. and other heroes of Earth 3, nothing

326
00:30:43,328 --> 00:30:49,372
they did was able to stop the wave. Resigned
to fight to the very end, Ultraman charged

327
00:30:49,432 --> 00:30:54,616
the oncoming wave at full force and was instantly
erased from existence, just before the rest

328
00:30:54,656 --> 00:30:59,947
of his universe also vanished. After the Crisis
on Infinite Earth's event concluded with the

329
00:30:59,967 --> 00:31:04,890
destruction of the multiverse and the creation
of a single universe, the villain's psycho

330
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:11,113
pirate revealed years later the ability to psychically
manifest any being from the former multiverse

331
00:31:11,213 --> 00:31:17,497
from his mask, known as the Medusa Mask, which
was revealed to contain Ultraman. Years later,

332
00:31:17,757 --> 00:31:22,359
it was also revealed that Ultraman's mind was
rescued prior to its destruction by the antimatter

333
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:28,511
wave by the Legion of Superheroes villain, Saturn
Queen. a powerful psychic from the future who

334
00:31:28,551 --> 00:31:34,074
attempted to use Ultraman to take over the bottled
city of Kandor in the present, though her plan

335
00:31:34,094 --> 00:31:39,657
was thwarted by Supergirl. While the Multiverse
had collapsed during the Crisis on Infinite

336
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:45,160
Earths, there did still exist an antimatter
counterpart to the Positive Matter Universe,

337
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:51,323
home to another antimatter version of the Crime
Syndicate and a new version of Ultraman. This

338
00:31:51,503 --> 00:31:57,338
antimatter version was formerly a human astronaut
named Lieutenant Clark Kent, whose spaceship

339
00:31:57,418 --> 00:32:03,762
exploded in hyperspace, and his body was rebuilt
by aliens using anti-cryptonite radiation in

340
00:32:03,802 --> 00:32:08,925
an effort to build the ultimate weapon. Clark
gained control of his new powers that he had

341
00:32:08,965 --> 00:32:14,328
developed before the aliens could control him,
however, and Clark returned to Earth. His mind

342
00:32:14,428 --> 00:32:20,130
now warped and used his powers to take over
the planet. Anti-Matter Ultraman was revealed

343
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:25,011
to be married to Superwoman, the Anti-Matter
Lois Lane, though she was having an affair

344
00:32:25,051 --> 00:32:31,113
with Anti-Matter Owlman. Ultraman's powers were
contingent upon exposure to Anti-Cryptonite.

345
00:32:31,753 --> 00:32:36,235
Though Anti-Matter Lex Luthor attempted to save
his Earth from the Crime Syndicate's rule,

346
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:40,956
with help from the Positive Matter Universe's
Justice League, his plan ultimately failed,

347
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:47,258
as the Anti-Matter Earth recognized the Crime
Syndicate as their legitimate leaders. Eventually,

348
00:32:47,358 --> 00:32:52,363
the Crime Syndicate grew bored with Earth's
collective Stockholm Syndrome and decided to

349
00:32:52,403 --> 00:32:58,229
attack the antimatter planet of Kord, home to
the Weponeers that created the very first yellow

350
00:32:58,269 --> 00:33:03,555
power ring. Their battle ended up creating a
positive matter wave that spread throughout

351
00:33:03,595 --> 00:33:09,039
the antimatter universe, altering its reality.
In an attempt to better understand what was

352
00:33:09,079 --> 00:33:14,422
going on, Ultraman and his allies visited the
positive matter universe disguised as their

353
00:33:14,482 --> 00:33:19,205
counterparts and eventually decided to stay.
Though they were fought back to their dimension

354
00:33:19,245 --> 00:33:25,048
by the Justice League, only to learn that now
everyone on their Earth hated them. When 52

355
00:33:25,149 --> 00:33:31,172
new universes were created during the Infinite
Crisis, Earth 3 was reimagined. This time,

356
00:33:31,292 --> 00:33:36,258
Krypton was destroyed by the Anti-Monitor. and
the young Cal Ill's father sent him from the

357
00:33:36,318 --> 00:33:42,500
dying planet into space to grow in power and
eventually get revenge. After landing on Earth,

358
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:48,162
the infant Cal forced two alcoholic drug addicts
named Jonathan and Martha Kent to adopt him,

359
00:33:48,382 --> 00:33:53,663
only to later murder them when he turned seven
years old. He eventually became Ultraman and

360
00:33:53,703 --> 00:33:58,325
formed the Crime Syndicate, once again taking
over the world only for it to be destroyed

361
00:33:58,405 --> 00:34:04,441
by the Anti-Monitor just like Krypton. It was
at this time that Darkseid on the Prime Earth

362
00:34:04,521 --> 00:34:10,347
gained the anti-life equation, initiating the
final crisis, and allowing the Crime Syndicate

363
00:34:10,387 --> 00:34:15,713
to escape Earth-3, though they became trapped
in an interdimensional limbo, save for their

364
00:34:15,753 --> 00:34:21,359
versions of Alfred and the Atom, who managed
to escape to the new Prime Continuity established

365
00:34:21,439 --> 00:34:27,924
after the Flash reset DC's timeline. After the
Earth-3 Alfred and Adam orchestrated a clash

366
00:34:28,004 --> 00:34:33,288
between the Justice League, JLA, and Justice
League Dark Teams, a portal was opened that

367
00:34:33,348 --> 00:34:38,872
unleashed Ultraman and his allies in the Prime
Universe while also trapping many of its heroes.

368
00:34:39,152 --> 00:34:44,395
The crime syndicate was eventually stopped by
Earth's villains, primarily by Lex Luthor,

369
00:34:44,596 --> 00:34:49,679
with Ultraman as the syndicate's only survivor.
Imprisoned by the Justice League upon their

370
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:55,244
return, he was eventually set free during a
war between Darkseid and the Anti-Monitor to

371
00:34:55,284 --> 00:35:00,688
help stop them. Ultraman put up his best fight
against the Anti-Monitor, but was easily killed

372
00:35:00,728 --> 00:35:07,274
by him in an anti-matter energy blast. The Earth-3
universe eventually healed itself, and Ultraman

373
00:35:07,294 --> 00:35:12,714
and the Crime Syndicate were reborn, and eventually
encountered by Superman's son, Jonathan Kent,

374
00:35:12,834 --> 00:35:18,758
whom Ultraman imprisoned and eventually confessed
to that he had no real friends. Ultraman and

375
00:35:18,798 --> 00:35:23,921
the crime syndicate joined Perpetua, the creator
of the multiverse, when she and Batman from

376
00:35:23,981 --> 00:35:30,044
across the Dark Multiverse attempted to destroy
it. Owlman, feeling betrayed that he was not

377
00:35:30,124 --> 00:35:35,968
one of the Dark Multiverse Batman and seeking
revenge against Perpetua, shot and killed Ultraman

378
00:35:36,188 --> 00:35:43,332
and Superwoman with a gun from Kord. Your deal
destroyed and recreated Earth-3, whose new

379
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:49,036
version of Ultraman obtained a device that allowed
him to traverse the multiverse and kill any

380
00:35:49,096 --> 00:35:54,960
Superman that he came across. Though Val Zod,
the black Superman of Earth-2, and Jonathan

381
00:35:54,980 --> 00:36:00,504
Kent tried to stop him, Ultraman banished Val
Zod to the Phantom Zone, and though Jonathan

382
00:36:00,544 --> 00:36:05,968
nearly defeated Ultraman, Ultraman was killed
by the Superman from the Injustice Universe,

383
00:36:06,108 --> 00:36:12,512
Earth-49. And that's his backstory. Powers-wise,
Ultraman's physiology allows him to gain vast

384
00:36:12,572 --> 00:36:17,976
power from the radiation of his native planet,
Krypton. Though he can store that radiation

385
00:36:18,056 --> 00:36:23,680
in his body, the presence of Kryptonite strengthens
him even further. He possesses vast strength

386
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:30,144
and durability, ultra-speed, and flight. He
also has ultra-senses, such as hearing and

387
00:36:30,244 --> 00:36:36,209
sight, and he can emit heat vision from his
eyes. His one weakness is that his powers will

388
00:36:36,249 --> 00:36:42,303
diminish over time without access to kryptonite
and this accelerates when exposed to solar

389
00:36:42,363 --> 00:36:49,470
radiation. He's more powerful in the dark. DC
has no shame. Like, how dare they rip off a

390
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:54,876
hero- Themselves? His beloved and popular as
Ultraman. What? The true Ultraman, which is

391
00:36:54,916 --> 00:36:56,077
the Japanese Ultraman.

392
00:36:59,238 --> 00:37:04,282
Actually, I think our Ultraman came before that
one. Do you know that for sure? Yes, I do.

393
00:37:04,783 --> 00:37:10,327
The Japanese Ultraman came out in 1966. And
the Silver Age version of Ultraman came out

394
00:37:10,447 --> 00:37:16,212
in 1964. So boom, damn it. Everyone copies DC,
gosh.

395
00:37:23,746 --> 00:37:28,389
But now that we've got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

396
00:37:28,429 --> 00:37:34,493
of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not this speculation,

397
00:37:34,813 --> 00:37:40,657
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could
play out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?

398
00:37:41,438 --> 00:37:45,441
Well, I should say there are no rules, other
than the characters have no prior knowledge

399
00:37:45,461 --> 00:37:49,864
of the other going into the fight. All they
are aware of starting out is that the other

400
00:37:49,884 --> 00:37:54,971
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.
For the speculation, the contestants will begin

401
00:37:54,991 --> 00:38:00,075
approximately 50 meters apart in a non-descript
environment that will have no bearing on the

402
00:38:00,095 --> 00:38:05,439
match itself, as no environmental statistics
are considered in my simulations. The contestants

403
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:10,782
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright
then, let's get into it. Ultraman and Hyperion

404
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:16,106
meet on the battlefield. Who goes first? Alright,
I'm going to say that since Ultraman is more

405
00:38:16,286 --> 00:38:22,830
evil and unhinged than Hyperion, he's going
to go first. He's gonna start by crushing a

406
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:27,512
kryptonite rock that he had and just snorting
that thing off the back of his hand. So now

407
00:38:27,532 --> 00:38:33,054
that he's more powered up, he's gonna ultra-speed
dash over to Hyperion and just like crush his

408
00:38:33,135 --> 00:38:38,957
neck in his bare hands. Where did he get this
kryptonite rock from? He has a stash of kryptonite

409
00:38:38,977 --> 00:38:45,620
that he keeps around him. He knows he needs
it. Alright. Alright, well Hyperion sees Ultraman

410
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:51,995
do this line of kryptonite crack and Hyperion's
against it. He's like, drugs are illegal and

411
00:38:52,535 --> 00:38:58,478
bad. So he's going to hold out his hand as Ultraman's
flying at him. And he just catches Ultraman's

412
00:38:58,538 --> 00:39:03,981
fist in his palm and uses that momentum to slam
Ultraman into the ground, just creating this

413
00:39:04,062 --> 00:39:09,445
massive crater that shakes whatever planet they're
onto its core. OK, I mean, that's fine. Ultraman,

414
00:39:09,605 --> 00:39:14,728
you know, he's going to ultra spin his body,
just drilling deep into the ground before he

415
00:39:14,788 --> 00:39:20,611
explodes back out right beneath Hyperion, just.
pushing him into space while heat visioning

416
00:39:20,651 --> 00:39:27,355
his face off. Okay, well as Hyperion's being
carried into space, he's gonna counter Ultraman's

417
00:39:27,395 --> 00:39:32,778
heat vision with his atomic vision. And like
the two eye beams are like canceling each other

418
00:39:32,918 --> 00:39:37,500
out and Hyperion is gonna grab Ultraman by the
head and then he's just gonna head butt the

419
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:44,344
shit out of him, sending Ultraman crashing back
into the ground from space. And then Hyperion

420
00:39:44,484 --> 00:39:50,231
with his eyes still glowing. He's going to fly
down and slam into Ultraman with this badass

421
00:39:50,311 --> 00:39:56,554
superhero landing pose. Except that Ultraman
sees Hyperion speeding down toward him, and

422
00:39:56,614 --> 00:40:02,396
he's going to use his ultra breath to freeze
Hyperion, causing him to just shatter once

423
00:40:02,436 --> 00:40:08,199
he hits the ground. So now there's blood and
ice everywhere. Yeah, Ultraman's blood. What?

424
00:40:08,759 --> 00:40:14,441
Because he just got freaking decimated by a
Hyperion ice missile. Like, ice isn't really

425
00:40:14,461 --> 00:40:19,075
going to hurt. Hyperion like he wouldn't freeze
through that fast considering his body is built

426
00:40:19,095 --> 00:40:23,837
like a nuclear reactor Fine, I guess Ultraman,
you know has the wind knocked out of him or

427
00:40:23,877 --> 00:40:29,119
something. He could withstand nuclear bombs
Okay. All right. So while Ultraman is winded

428
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:35,002
Hyperion yanks him by the cape and swings him
around and around and around Choking Ultraman

429
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:40,564
by his collar and then Hyperion let's go the
cape Tossing him like a hammer throw and sending

430
00:40:40,684 --> 00:40:47,584
Ultraman crashing right into a nearby moon.
On moon? Okay Uh, so Ultraman, you know, he's

431
00:40:47,664 --> 00:40:52,788
gonna grab that moon and just hurl it right
back down toward Hyperion, just annihilating

432
00:40:52,808 --> 00:40:57,992
him and the planet he's on. Is he strong enough
to do that? Yeah, uh, actually Ultraman had

433
00:40:58,032 --> 00:41:03,537
to move the moon between the sun and the Earth,
so that the Earth was in a constant state of

434
00:41:03,577 --> 00:41:09,461
eclipse, and so he wouldn't be degraded power-wise.
Oh, interesting. Okay, well, Hyperion sees

435
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:14,105
that this moon is gonna crash down onto him.
I don't think he would have any choice but

436
00:41:14,145 --> 00:41:18,552
to, like, meet it head on by flying through
it, kind of like a bullet through a bowling

437
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:23,415
ball type situation, which is, you know, it's
going to hurt him. Like a bullet is not going

438
00:41:23,435 --> 00:41:27,177
to go through a bowling ball unscathed. The
same goes for Hyperion. You know, it's going

439
00:41:27,197 --> 00:41:30,959
to hurt him. He's going to be drained pretty
badly, but he is going to be angry and he's

440
00:41:30,979 --> 00:41:36,283
going to be like, you throw another moon at
me. I'm going to lose it. So Ultraman throws

441
00:41:36,303 --> 00:41:43,315
another moon at Hyperion. What? For where? I
don't know. But. The thing is, this one randomly

442
00:41:43,455 --> 00:41:48,920
happened to be filled with kryptonite. Who knew?
Oh my God. Basically, when it explodes upon

443
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:55,205
hitting Hyperion, it's going to turn Ultraman
into like a god and now he's like this reality

444
00:41:55,245 --> 00:42:01,931
warping telekinetic and he's going to mentally
explode Hyperion's atoms across the universe.

445
00:42:02,451 --> 00:42:08,597
Just with a thought. Boom. Dude, that's environmental.
You can't say the moon has kryptonite in it.

446
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:12,724
Like who's to say? I mean, I do. I just I just
said that. Like you're the one who brought

447
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:17,788
the moon into it. Well, most planets have a
moon like that seems fairly easy to assume.

448
00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:23,793
But also, like you said in Ultraman's bio that
too much kryptonite exposure paralyzed him

449
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:27,637
because he like developed too many powers at
once or something. Well, that's a silver age

450
00:42:27,657 --> 00:42:32,981
version. I don't care. I want to say instead
of killing Hyperion, Ultraman's like, eh, it's

451
00:42:33,021 --> 00:42:39,098
too much power and he's going to go into a coma,
at which point Hyperion. It's gonna take this

452
00:42:39,138 --> 00:42:44,542
opportunity and he's just gonna fly Hyperion
into the nearest sun, which is just gonna render

453
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:51,907
Ultraman powerless and like ultra dead. Alright,
that would definitely kill Ultraman. So yeah,

454
00:42:51,947 --> 00:42:57,431
we'll leave it there. Either Ultraman is killed
by being thrown into a sun and just losing

455
00:42:57,471 --> 00:43:03,595
his power from the solar radiation, or he gets
ultra powered up from a whole bunch of kryptonite

456
00:43:03,635 --> 00:43:08,918
around him and just erases Hyperion from existence.
Yeah, sounds pretty good. Let's go ahead and

457
00:43:08,998 --> 00:43:14,240
enter the character stats, run the simulations
and come back with a winner. AG9K, hit it!

458
00:43:14,821 --> 00:43:22,644
Inputting data, running calculations, processing
results, simulations complete. Okay, so these

459
00:43:22,704 --> 00:43:28,226
characters are both Superman, analogs, ripoffs,
whatever you may want to call them. They're

460
00:43:28,246 --> 00:43:34,949
basically Superman. So it's not surprising that
their stats were basically equal to Superman's.

461
00:43:35,326 --> 00:43:40,549
Yeah, they had the same speed, evasiveness,
durability, strength, damage level, fighting

462
00:43:40,589 --> 00:43:45,773
skill, range, versatility. They were pretty
much a match. Which is pretty rare. Like, we

463
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:50,236
don't come across that too often. We try not
to. Right. Because if we know the character

464
00:43:50,256 --> 00:43:54,339
stats are the same, we run into a situation
where it's a guaranteed coin flip, you know,

465
00:43:54,379 --> 00:44:00,223
50-50 on who wins. But you know, it could still
be anybody's fight. According to our Instagram

466
00:44:00,343 --> 00:44:06,860
poll takers, they believe that Ultraman is ultimately
going to come out on top in this match. Sixty

467
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:12,403
two percent of those who voted in Ultraman's
favor. And I'm going to chalk that up to them

468
00:44:12,443 --> 00:44:20,249
thinking it was the Japanese Ultraman. There's
a photo of Ultraman on the pole. I don't really

469
00:44:20,269 --> 00:44:23,971
know anything about the Japanese Ultraman, so
I don't know what his powers are, but I'm still

470
00:44:23,991 --> 00:44:29,315
going to say he's more popular. Well, let's
find out who the winner is. H.E. 9K, the results,

471
00:44:29,355 --> 00:44:35,836
please. Hey, you are, sir. All right. The winner.
between the Crime Syndicate's Ultraman and

472
00:44:35,876 --> 00:44:44,305
the Squadron Supreme's Hyperion is... Hyperion!
Really close though, almost a coin toss, Hyperion

473
00:44:44,345 --> 00:44:52,753
won 517 matches out of the 1000 simulations
whereas Ultraman only won 483. So Hyperion's

474
00:44:52,793 --> 00:45:01,840
51.7% over Ultraman's 48.3%. And I knew this
was gonna happen once I realized that I had

475
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:08,565
to concede Ultraman's intelligent stat. He's
definitely not as smart as Superman, so we

476
00:45:08,585 --> 00:45:14,149
figured he's not as smart as Hyperion. Yeah,
Hyperion's not the sharpest tool in the shed,

477
00:45:14,269 --> 00:45:18,572
you know. He was the one who thought that it
would be a good idea to essentially become

478
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:23,855
a dictator over an authoritarian state, but
he's also not so stupid to think that he can

479
00:45:23,955 --> 00:45:30,035
punch an antimatter wave and have that be okay.
Yeah, that was kind of humorous when I read

480
00:45:30,075 --> 00:45:36,539
that. So, I mean, I guess I can't be too bummed.
The good guy won, even if it is a Marvel guy.

481
00:45:36,699 --> 00:45:41,182
Still a rip off, though. Essentially, you could
say Superman wins in the end in this match.

482
00:45:41,722 --> 00:45:48,826
No, I period would beat him to what? No, no,
he loses just on originality points alone.

483
00:45:49,086 --> 00:45:53,929
Like that needs to be a new stat originality.
DC is going to top out Marvel every time in

484
00:45:53,969 --> 00:45:57,918
that stat. As we've said many times on the show,
it's not about who does it first. It's about

485
00:45:57,938 --> 00:46:02,920
who does it better. And if there was a quality
stat, Marvel would be higher because their

486
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:08,401
characters are just better. So it would even
out. If you're arguing that Hyperion is better

487
00:46:08,821 --> 00:46:13,643
than Superman. Yes. I would have fucked. Duh.
Obviously. Next time I see you, when's the

488
00:46:13,683 --> 00:46:20,004
next family dinner? Be prepared. I'm not afraid
of you. Well, I guess that does it for this

489
00:46:20,104 --> 00:46:24,505
duel. Let us know what you thought about the

497
00:47:01,772 --> 00:47:05,855
duel, where we pit two characters outside of
the main Marvel and DC continuity against each

498
00:47:05,895 --> 00:47:11,939
other. This time we're going to find out who'd
win in a fight between Rocket, who is the sidekick

499
00:47:11,979 --> 00:47:19,544
to Icon. Yeah, from Milestone Comics. Versus
Spider-Gwen, who everybody knows is a popular

500
00:47:19,604 --> 00:47:24,627
Spider-themed multiversal character. And of
course, that episode is in lead up to Madam

501
