00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,959
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,174 --> 00:00:28,376
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:28,516 --> 00:00:33,399
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters and stat-based

4
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:39,642
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother Johnny DC. And guys, we are

5
00:00:39,662 --> 00:00:44,765
in the eye of the storm of what Jonathan and
I are calling review hell right now. We still

6
00:00:44,785 --> 00:00:49,047
have three more DC things to review because
DC sucks and that is Suicide Squad

7
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,831
We've been reviewing so many things that we
haven't done a duel episode since over a month

8
00:00:56,871 --> 00:01:02,014
ago with Atrocitus vs Juggernaut, but this episode,
we're getting back to it. We're going to find

9
00:01:02,054 --> 00:01:07,398
out who would win in a fight between Arsenal
and White Widow. Arsenal was formerly Speedy,

10
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:12,681
sometimes also known as Red Arrow, but he's
the protégé of Green Arrow, whereas White Widow

11
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:18,164
is the protégé of Black Widow. And her real
name is Yelena Belova, and you know probably

12
00:01:18,224 --> 00:01:22,078
all about her from the Black Widow movie. She's
played by Florence Pugh. And if you're a fan

13
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:27,661
of CW's Arrow, you'll know Roy Harper because
he was played by Colton Haynes. Nobody watched

14
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:33,664
that show. Hey, if we're naming actors, why
can't I? But before we get into the characters'

15
00:01:33,724 --> 00:01:37,607
backstories, run the simulations, and determine
who would win in a match-up between the two

16
00:01:37,627 --> 00:01:42,009
characters, we're going to break down the comic
book movie news from the past week, of which

17
00:01:42,029 --> 00:01:46,972
there was only one interesting news item. And
that was that James Spader is returning to

18
00:01:46,992 --> 00:01:53,405
voice Ultron for the upcoming Vision. Disney
Plus television series. As always we list our

quick to the no prize A no prize is an award

41
00:03:54,482 --> 00:03:59,766
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version,
the Dynamic Duel No Prize, is a digital award

42
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:04,309
that we post on Instagram for the person we
feel gave the best answer to our question of

43
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:10,554
the week. Last week we asked, which upcoming
DC Studios film or show are you most looking

44
00:04:10,594 --> 00:04:16,598
forward to and why? Of course in the week prior,
we asked what MCU project you were most looking

45
00:04:16,618 --> 00:04:21,978
forward to and we only got two answers. This
time we got so many more! because so many more

46
00:04:22,018 --> 00:04:27,621
people are looking forward to DC stuff. Well,
DC fans are insecure, but also we got quite

47
00:04:27,641 --> 00:04:31,783
a few answers that said, no one cares. I'm not
looking forward to any DC project because DC

48
00:04:31,843 --> 00:04:35,505
sucks. Well, I mean, doesn't that prove that
Marvel fans are insecure? Like, why even call

49
00:04:35,605 --> 00:04:44,030
in with that answer? Because it's fun to dunk
on DC. It's fun to be butthurt. OK. We have

50
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,992
three honorable mentions and a no prize winner
to get through. So our first honorable mention

51
00:04:48,032 --> 00:04:53,275
goes to Travis Herndon. Who said? What's up,
dynamic dudes? Travis here. Shout out to my

52
00:04:53,295 --> 00:04:58,459
other twins. So my answer would have to be the
Creature Commandos. Just like the Guardians

53
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:04,804
of the Galaxy, I am very surprised to even see
this sort of D-list superhero group be in a

54
00:05:04,844 --> 00:05:10,068
theatrical universe like this. So I'm excited
for the show. I'm excited to be in the live

55
00:05:10,148 --> 00:05:16,093
action series. So yeah, Creature Commandos is
going to be cool. It's going to basically be

56
00:05:16,113 --> 00:05:22,209
DC's Guardians. Yeah, I'm really looking forward
to this kicking off James Gunn's DC Universe.

57
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,613
I know it's going to be animated, but I still
feel like it'll set the tone for a lot of what's

58
00:05:26,653 --> 00:05:31,917
coming, considering that James Gunn wrote it.
Plus, the creature commandos are just a really

59
00:05:31,937 --> 00:05:38,062
cool team. I love the concept of like a super
team of these borderline universal monster

60
00:05:38,102 --> 00:05:42,986
type characters, and I think it's going to be
a lot of fun. Yeah, we might just have to squeeze

61
00:05:43,026 --> 00:05:48,390
in a duel with the creature commandos around
Halloween time. Yeah, maybe. Great answer,

62
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:54,632
Travis. Our next honorable mention goes to Lizzie
Dyer Arnie, who said, It's Lizzie. And of course,

63
00:05:54,693 --> 00:05:58,654
the DC series that I'm most looking forward
to is the superhero you've never heard of,

64
00:05:59,014 --> 00:06:05,377
Mr. Booster Gold. He's got definitely the most
unique origin story. He's a college football

65
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:11,940
player from the future who gets expelled for
illegal gambling. And he works as a security

66
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:16,118
guard and steals some stuff from the Superhero
Museum. and then he comes back to our time

67
00:06:16,138 --> 00:06:21,579
to become a superhero. He is just such a fun
guy and I love him. Yeah, Booster Gold, of

68
00:06:21,619 --> 00:06:27,861
course, is an upcoming, I believe television
project from DC Studios. Rumors are heavily

69
00:06:27,941 --> 00:06:34,123
pointing to Kumail Nanjiani to play the lead
role of Booster Gold, which I don't hate because

70
00:06:34,443 --> 00:06:40,224
it's a very comedic role and he's a very comedic
guy. And also there'd be an awesome blow to

71
00:06:40,264 --> 00:06:45,570
Marvel because he of course was one of the Eternals.
Yeah, he was Kingo. in the Eternals movie.

72
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:49,752
I thought he was an awesome Kingo. I know that
he'll make an awesome Booster Gold and it would

73
00:06:49,772 --> 00:06:54,454
be really interesting to see who they would
cast as Blue Beetle. You know there's the Jamie

74
00:06:54,474 --> 00:06:59,136
Reyes Blue Beetle and then there's the Ted Kord
Blue Beetle. And since James Gunn said the

75
00:06:59,196 --> 00:07:04,058
movie version of Blue Beetle would be making
his way into the new DCU and in that movie

76
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:08,500
they made reference to Ted Kord, I think it
would be a lot of fun seeing who they cast

77
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:13,690
as the Blue Beetle Booster Gold duo. Yeah, I'm
still rooting for Jason Sudeikis, but we'll

78
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:20,212
see if that happens. Great answer, Lizzie. Our
final honorable mention goes to Scott Camacho,

79
00:07:20,492 --> 00:07:26,914
who said Scotty Macho here. One I am looking
forward to only because of my son's namesake

80
00:07:27,574 --> 00:07:32,396
is Batman, Brave and the Bold. I really want
to see what they're going to do with Damien

81
00:07:32,436 --> 00:07:39,262
Wayne. Batman, Brave and the Bold. Gilly Macho
here. And this is mine. DC sucks. Shut the

82
00:07:39,322 --> 00:07:45,865
fuck up, don't fricking come in here. DC's up.
Dude, I know all about embarrassing twin brothers.

83
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:52,049
Let me tell ya, it's rough. Gilly, you're my
boy. Thank you so much for that. Way out of

84
00:07:52,089 --> 00:07:57,212
line, way out of line. Batman Brave and the
Bold is gonna be awesome. I'm still really

85
00:07:57,252 --> 00:08:02,315
hoping, honestly, that they bring Robert Pattinson
into the DCU. Probably not gonna happen, but

86
00:08:02,455 --> 00:08:06,417
I can still hold out hope because they haven't
really announced any casting news for this

87
00:08:06,457 --> 00:08:11,325
film yet. That said, I'm still really looking
forward to it because we may finally get a

88
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:17,450
Batman and Robin in live action on the big screen
that works. The way you could do it with Robert

89
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:23,996
Pattinson is have his fling with Talia Al Ghul
happen, not when he's Batman, but while he's

90
00:08:24,036 --> 00:08:29,320
training around the world. So when he was younger,
that way it's still believable that Batman

91
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:35,682
could still have a child. Yeah, and a five year
old Damian would be totally fine with me. just

92
00:08:35,702 --> 00:08:41,567
like kicking ass, it would be hilarious. I could
see it. Great answer, Scotty. Dishonorable

93
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:45,970
mention to you, Gillie. Which also counts as
an honorable mention coming from a DC guy,

94
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:51,695
so good job. We wanna give a special thanks
to Cyrus Moore, Abner O'Tary, and Kat Stevenson

95
00:08:51,715 --> 00:08:56,879
for taking the time to visit our website and
record an answer. And Gil Camacho and Nate

96
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:02,784
Wagner. No, no, they're dead to me. The winner
of this week's snow prize, however, is Mickey

97
00:09:02,824 --> 00:09:08,081
Math and Gian, who said... Hey, what's up guys?
This is Miggi and no surprise the DC Studios

98
00:09:08,121 --> 00:09:12,284
film I'm looking forward to the most is Superman.
I'm a huge Superman fan and everything I've

99
00:09:12,304 --> 00:09:20,972
seen from GunsPost about his inspirations and
set photos and the casting, the costume design,

100
00:09:21,052 --> 00:09:25,916
it just looks like it's going to be the perfect
Superman film. And a great start to the DC

101
00:09:26,097 --> 00:09:33,414
Studios reboot. So yeah, Superman. I'm super
excited. Thanks guys. Yeah, the initial photo

102
00:09:33,454 --> 00:09:38,737
they released of David Corn sweat as Superman
in the costume did not get my hopes up, but

103
00:09:38,797 --> 00:09:45,101
the set photos absolutely did. From seeing the
costume on set to all of the actors portraying

104
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:50,704
their different roles, I am so unbelievably
pumped for James Gunn's Superman movie, which

105
00:09:50,764 --> 00:09:56,727
as Biggie said is really going to kick off James
Gunn's DC universe in the live action sense.

106
00:09:56,747 --> 00:10:03,242
I mean yeah, if you like that sort of thing.
Uh, yeah, bro. DC fans do, and that's why this

107
00:10:03,282 --> 00:10:08,104
is the best answer, cause it's effing Superman.
And if you don't like Superman, then you don't

108
00:10:08,144 --> 00:10:13,647
like superheroes, cause they wouldn't exist
without him. So then. I mean, surely there

109
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:18,709
was Zorro before Superman, you know, he was
kind of a superhero. I'm sorry, could he leap

110
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:24,671
tall buildings in a single bound? No, fuck Zorro.
John Carter of Mars? Was he faster than a speeding

111
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:30,106
bullet? No, fuck John Carter. The Phantom? Oh,
was he bullet powerful than a locomotive? I

112
00:10:30,126 --> 00:10:36,193
have no idea. Oh, it's Phantom! What is happening?
Superman, that's what's happening. Next year

113
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:40,197
he's happening. It's gonna be awesome. Can't
wait for it. Great answer, Miggie. You win

114
00:10:40,217 --> 00:10:44,302
this week's No Prize. If you the listener want
a shot at winning your own No Prize, stay tuned

115
00:10:44,322 --> 00:10:48,887
to later on in this episode when we'll be asking
another Question of the Week. And now that

116
00:10:48,907 --> 00:10:50,669
that's done, on to the news!

117
00:10:56,130 --> 00:11:01,253
Alright, this past week we learned from the
Hollywood Reporter that the actor James Spader

118
00:11:01,273 --> 00:11:07,497
would be returning as the voice of the villain
Ultron in the upcoming Vision series. Now,

119
00:11:07,837 --> 00:11:11,620
previously we heard that the series was going
to be called Vision Quest, but the Hollywood

120
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:17,144
Reporter said that that's not the official title,
which thank God, because really the series

121
00:11:17,184 --> 00:11:21,907
should just be called Vision. I don't know,
I kind of liked the title Vision Quest. Shut

122
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:29,280
up! So the Hollywood Reporter also called...
Vision series as like the third in a sort of

123
00:11:29,741 --> 00:11:36,246
Trilogy of television shows starting with WandaVision
followed up by Agatha all along and then ending

124
00:11:36,326 --> 00:11:41,510
with this upcoming Vision series Which is a
pretty cool concept Rumors are that Elizabeth

125
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:46,875
Olsen will be returning in her role as the Scarlet
Witch in the upcoming Vision series as well

126
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:52,259
Although that's not been confirmed. Spoiler
maybe? I don't think so. I think it's pretty

127
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:56,851
expected, right? If she was gonna show up anywhere,
it would be here Well, maybe it's like a flashback

128
00:11:56,871 --> 00:12:01,414
or something. I guess it could be. Or maybe
she's just coming back from the dead in Agatha,

129
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:07,259
La Lange. Who knows? But this is exciting news.
If you remember from the end of the Avengers

130
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:14,285
Age of Ultron movie, Ultron allegedly died off
screen during a conversation with Vision, where

131
00:12:14,305 --> 00:12:18,648
they kind of had this philosophical discussion
about the nature of humanity. And then Ultron

132
00:12:18,808 --> 00:12:22,151
lunges at Vision, and then there's a bright
flash of light. And then we never really see

133
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:27,366
what happens. We're just left to assume that
Ultron is dead. But as we know from the comics,

134
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:34,649
Ultron has implanted failsafe coding within
the Vision android, compelling him to rebuild

135
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:38,490
the evil robot. Now that may not be exactly
what's happening here, especially since the

136
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:43,992
original Vision body was recreated by the Sword
Organization and he's white in color now and

137
00:12:44,032 --> 00:12:48,033
kind of devoid of his previous personality,
also similar to what happened in the comics.

138
00:12:48,213 --> 00:12:53,120
So. There's a lot of cool stuff going on here.
I really like the character of Vision, especially

139
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,123
how he's portrayed by actor Paul Bettany. So
I'm really excited for this series, especially

140
00:12:58,163 --> 00:13:02,026
now that we know that Ultron's gonna be the
bad guy. I feel like series like these should

141
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:06,829
have come years ago. Like I'm so ready for Marvel
to pick up all these loose threads that they've

142
00:13:06,849 --> 00:13:11,612
been dangling everywhere. Ultron being a big
one. Yeah, and Vision too. We've been waiting

143
00:13:11,632 --> 00:13:16,803
to see what happened with the white Vision ever
since 2021. I can't remember, did we like James

144
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:25,510
Spader as Ultron or was it lame? My impression
was that he did a great dark sinister voice.

145
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:30,735
It wasn't necessarily what I thought the character
sounded like based on how I read it in the

146
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:37,480
comics. I would set up him as a little bit more
snivelly and whiny I guess. But yeah, I like

147
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:44,962
James Spader as an actor and he does a good
take on Ultron I would say. thinking behind

148
00:13:45,022 --> 00:13:51,267
Spader's casting in Avengers Age of Ultron was
that Joss Whedon was kind of counter casting

149
00:13:51,327 --> 00:13:57,212
against Robert Downey Jr. because both Downey
and Spader were teen heartthrobs in the 80s.

150
00:13:57,592 --> 00:14:03,697
And considering how Ultron here was kind of
portrayed as the brain child of Tony Stark,

151
00:14:03,837 --> 00:14:08,160
I thought that all fit pretty well. Yeah, I
think if anyone could go toe to toe with Robert

152
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,739
Downey Jr., it's definitely... James Spader.
He's a solid actor. And definitely a formidable

153
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,222
one for Paul Bettany to go up against. For sure.
For sure. It's gonna be a great show. I can't

154
00:14:17,242 --> 00:14:21,385
wait for Marvel to announce a release date for
Vision. But as soon as we know it, we'll let

155
00:14:21,405 --> 00:14:26,488
you guys know. But speaking of great casting
for a Marvel villain, that brings us to our

156
00:14:26,528 --> 00:14:27,289
Question of the Week.

157
00:14:31,726 --> 00:14:38,408

DC villain of all time? A lot of great options

158
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:42,970
to choose from, from both Marvel and DC, so

164
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,924
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and get into

165
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:20,896
our main event where we find out who'd win in
a fight between the Green Arrow protégé, Arsenal,

166
00:15:21,276 --> 00:15:23,741
and the Black Widow protégé, White Widow.

167
00:15:39,042 --> 00:15:44,444
All right, Arsenal versus White Widow. We are
doing this duel episode now because it's a

168
00:15:44,484 --> 00:15:48,365
lead up to our team duel that we have going
on in a few weeks where we find out who'd win

169
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:54,528
in a fight between the Outsiders team versus
X-Force. And that was selected by our executive

170
00:15:54,568 --> 00:15:59,490
producers. That's going to be a fun episode.
But Arsenal is a quintessential outsider. Yes.

171
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:07,733
He was the leader of an incarnation of the Outsiders
for a time. Yes. And he has the ability of

172
00:16:07,893 --> 00:16:13,259
a marksman. just like Green Arrow, correct?
Uh, yeah, except he uses more than a bow and

173
00:16:13,299 --> 00:16:18,562
arrow. Like, Green Arrow pretty much sticks
to only that, but Arsenal has a literal arsenal

174
00:16:18,702 --> 00:16:24,504
of weapons that he is a perfect marksman with.
Does he have a boxing glove arrow? I'm sure

175
00:16:24,545 --> 00:16:29,547
he does. As Arsenal, he's a little probably
too cool and hip for something like that. But

176
00:16:29,607 --> 00:16:33,509
as Speedy, you know, in his younger years, he
definitely used that. You know who doesn't

177
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:37,818
have a boxing glove arrow? White Widow. And
that's probably because she doesn't have a

178
00:16:37,878 --> 00:16:43,059
bow, but it automatically makes her the better
character. I just said Arsenal doesn't use

179
00:16:43,099 --> 00:16:48,681
that. Well, in my headcanon, he does. He fires
nothing but boxing glove arrows and he's a

180
00:16:48,761 --> 00:16:53,142
big dumb dumb. Well that will be your downfall.
To be fair, I don't really know much about

181
00:16:53,162 --> 00:16:57,183
the character, so I guess I'm going to find
out now as we go into the characters backstories,

182
00:16:57,363 --> 00:17:01,824
input their stats, run simulations, and find
out who to win in a fight. But to explain the

183
00:17:01,844 --> 00:17:06,346
methodology behind our duels, let's go to our
sentient duel simulator. Alfred Jarvis 9000.

184
00:17:07,286 --> 00:17:13,809
AJ9K, tell our listeners how you go about determining
a winner in our duel matchups. Yes, of course,

185
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:18,651
sir. The way I determine a winner between the
contestants is by running 1000 Monte Carlo

186
00:17:18,691 --> 00:17:23,693
simulations using the characters statistics.
A Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic

187
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:29,275
model used to determine outcomes through random
sampling. In this case, I randomize the statistics

188
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:33,977
along a normal distribution as a way to simulate
the many variables that can occur during battle.

189
00:17:34,402 --> 00:17:39,143
The stat parameters are based on the official
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters'

190
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:44,345
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat
categories are included such as range, damage

191
00:17:44,385 --> 00:17:49,787
potential, versatility and perception in order
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.

192
00:17:50,287 --> 00:17:55,089
The results of the 1000 simulations provide
a percentage of wins for each character. The

193
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:59,582
contestant with the higher percentage is declared
the victor. as they have a higher probability

194
00:17:59,602 --> 00:18:05,444
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,
neither character should win 100% of the matches.

195
00:18:05,944 --> 00:18:10,425
The comic book stories have shown that there's
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so

196
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:14,346
the confidence rate of my method falls in line
with the precedents that have been established

197
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:19,928
in the source material. My mathematical simulations
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are

198
00:18:19,968 --> 00:18:24,369
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes
tabulated for determination of the winner.

199
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:29,950
Thanks, Adrian 9K. Before we run the simulations
though, we like to break down each character's

200
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:34,532
histories and abilities before improvising a
scenario on how we imagine one of the 1000

201
00:18:34,932 --> 00:18:40,214
simulations would play out beat for beat. And
I believe, Jonathan, it is your turn to go

202
00:18:40,254 --> 00:18:45,736
first with the DC character, so tell us all
about Arsenal. Alright. Roy Harper Jr. was

203
00:18:45,816 --> 00:18:51,217
raised by a single father, Roy Sr., who was
a forest ranger in the southwestern United

204
00:18:51,277 --> 00:18:57,714
States. At age two, Roy Jr. was orphaned when
his father helped evacuate and rescue members

205
00:18:57,754 --> 00:19:04,139
of a Navajo reservation because of a wildfire,
and Roy was adopted by Brave Bow, the tribe's

206
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:11,064
shaman who trained Roy in archery. When Green
Arrow emerged as a superhero, Roy became fascinated

207
00:19:11,124 --> 00:19:15,868
that someone could become a hero with only a
bow and arrow. When Brave Bow learned that

208
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:20,798
he was dying from an illness, He invited Green
Arrow to visit the reservation and judge an

209
00:19:20,898 --> 00:19:26,760
archery tournament, during which Roy impressed
Green Arrow with his bow skills. Though Roy

210
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:32,702
was sabotaged in the final round of the competition,
Green Arrow recognized how fast Roy was with

211
00:19:32,742 --> 00:19:38,904
his bow, even speedier than him, and he agreed
to take Roy on as his ward to continue his

212
00:19:39,004 --> 00:19:44,025
archery training as well as foster skills in
crime fighting. When Green Arrow felt Roy was

213
00:19:44,085 --> 00:19:48,527
ready, He presented him with his own costume
and trick arrows so that he could become his

214
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:53,828
sidekick, known as Speedy. You can learn more
about Green Arrow in our Green Arrow vs Hawkeye

215
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:59,229
Duel episode. After aiding Green Arrow in numerous
adventures against villains such as Count Murdigo

216
00:19:59,269 --> 00:20:04,031
and Clock King, Roy eventually helped found
a team of teen sidekicks known as the Teen

217
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:09,092
Titans, which you can learn more about in our
Titans vs X-Men Duel episode. After breaking

218
00:20:09,152 --> 00:20:15,038
up with his teenage sweetheart Donna Troy, the
eventual disbandment of the The loss of Green

219
00:20:15,098 --> 00:20:19,459
Arrow's fortune and its subsequent abandonment
of Roy to travel the country with Green Lantern

220
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:25,621
and Black Canary, Roy, depressed, turned to
drugs and became addicted to heroin. When Green

221
00:20:25,701 --> 00:20:31,362
Arrow uncovered Roy's drug use, he kicked him
to the curb, forcing Roy into homelessness.

222
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:36,724
It took some time, but eventually Roy overcame
his addiction after promising to Black Canary

223
00:20:36,744 --> 00:20:41,065
that he would, though it took a lot longer for
him to overcome his resentment toward Green

224
00:20:41,185 --> 00:20:46,747
Arrow. Having grown into an adult, Roy became
a counselor to teams with drug problems, and

225
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:51,691
he attempted to become a crime fighter once
again, even joining a reformed Team Titans,

226
00:20:51,971 --> 00:20:57,154
though the team later disbanded. Eventually,
Roy was recognized by the Central Bureau of

227
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:03,678
Investigations, or CBI, as a potential clandestine
agent to stop drug trafficking and terrorism.

228
00:21:04,018 --> 00:21:08,421
The CBI trained him in the use of firearms and
turned him into an official drug enforcement

229
00:21:08,561 --> 00:21:13,600
agent. tasked on one assignment to gain the
trust of a foreign assassin named Cheshire.

230
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,803
Though Roy was eventually supposed to turn Cheshire
into the authorities, the two ended up falling

231
00:21:18,863 --> 00:21:24,346
in love and having an affair. Worried that their
relationship would endanger her, Roy abandoned

232
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:29,289
Cheshire, unaware that she was pregnant and
would give birth to his daughter, Leanne. When

233
00:21:29,349 --> 00:21:33,972
Roy learned of Leanne's existence, he and Nightwing,
who you can learn more about in our Nightwing

234
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:39,684
vs. Daredevil episode, tracked Cheshire down.
though she captured and poisoned Roy, leaving

235
00:21:39,724 --> 00:21:44,508
him for dead along with their daughter. Though
Nightwing was able to save Roy, and Roy accepted

236
00:21:44,528 --> 00:21:49,932
the responsibility of being a single father,
just as his father was. After the CBI was moved

237
00:21:50,032 --> 00:21:55,577
under the larger clandestine organization Checkmate,
Nightwing came to an agreement with the US

238
00:21:55,597 --> 00:22:01,261
government that the Titans should be a gove
team, at which point Nightwing stepped down

239
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:07,578
as team leader, and Roy, now going by the new
superhero codename Arsenal. took his place.

240
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:13,363
The Titans team eventually dissolved, and Arsenal
used the opportunity to reconcile with Green

241
00:22:13,443 --> 00:22:19,848
Arrow, shortly before his Mator dive in an airplane
explosion. After a new incarnation of the Titans

242
00:22:19,888 --> 00:22:25,052
disbanded following the death of several team
members at the hands of Brainiac, Arsenal received

243
00:22:25,132 --> 00:22:30,657
corporate sponsorship to form a new superteam,
which he named the Outsiders. That included

244
00:22:30,757 --> 00:22:33,259
Nightwing, the Green Lantern-powered Jade,

245
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:42,801
and a rehabilitated brainiac robot named Indigo,
among others. During one mission, the team

246
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:49,184
encountered a child slaver named Tanner from
Roy's past as an undercover CBI agent. Tanner

247
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:54,827
recognized Roy and decided to torture him by
kidnapping his daughter, Leon, even branding

248
00:22:54,867 --> 00:22:59,970
her with his mark. But Roy and the outsiders
were able to track him down and safely rescue

249
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:05,033
all of the children he had captured, including
Leon. After being shot in the chest and having

250
00:23:05,053 --> 00:23:10,036
his throat slit- During the team's many adventures,
Roy decided that the outsider's aggressive

251
00:23:10,096 --> 00:23:14,679
approach to crime fighting wasn't suitable for
a single father, and he left the team with

252
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:19,803
Nightwing in charge. Eventually, Roy was recruited
to the Justice League, during which time he

253
00:23:19,823 --> 00:23:25,747
was dubbed Red Arrow by Green Lantern, an identity
he fully embraced by taking up the bow as his

254
00:23:25,827 --> 00:23:31,030
primary weapon once again. During his time on
the League, the team was attacked by the villain

255
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:36,406
Prometheus, who infiltrated their satellite
headquarters, ambushed Roy, and sliced off

256
00:23:36,446 --> 00:23:41,568
his arm with a sword. You can learn more about
Prometheus in our Prometheus vs Taskmaster

257
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:47,731
duel episode. As Roy was undergoing emergency
medical treatment for his arm, Prometheus successfully

258
00:23:47,771 --> 00:23:53,293
destroyed most of Star City, where Roy resided
with his daughter. Leon was home when it was

259
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:58,515
destroyed, and she died as a result. Green Arrow,
who had long since returned to life by this

260
00:23:58,575 --> 00:24:04,346
point, killed Prometheus in response, and Roy
was given a cybernetic arm. though it was of

261
00:24:04,426 --> 00:24:09,528
little solace as he initially had trouble aiming
with his new arm, and in his despair he turned

262
00:24:09,608 --> 00:24:14,690
to painkillers. He was eventually ambushed one
night in his new home by Cheshire, who blamed

263
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:19,472
him for Leon's death, though in their dispute
the two ended up grieving together rather than

264
00:24:19,532 --> 00:24:25,154
fighting. Returning to heroin, Roy took to the
streets, viciously beating up criminals while

265
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:30,757
high. He was eventually discovered by Nightwing,
who put Roy in rehab, though Roy escaped and

266
00:24:30,777 --> 00:24:36,100
later killed the imprisoned villain. known as
the Electrocutioner, who was Prometheus' accomplice

267
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,324
in the destruction of Star City. After which,
Roy burned down his home and all of his possessions

268
00:24:41,624 --> 00:24:46,467
while reclaiming the mantle of Arsenal. Roy
joined Deathstroke's villainous version of

269
00:24:46,487 --> 00:24:51,311
the Titans, helping to build a healing machine
called the Methuselah that Deathstroke was

270
00:24:51,411 --> 00:24:56,334
able to use to heal his son, Jericho. You can
learn more about Deathstroke in his duel episode

271
00:24:56,354 --> 00:25:01,546
against Deadpool. When Deathstroke claimed the
machine could also bring back Leon, Cheshire

272
00:25:01,586 --> 00:25:06,769
jumped at the opportunity, but Roy came to the
sobering conclusion that his daughter was in

273
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:11,411
a better place, and he took on Deathstroke and
the rest of the team to successfully destroy

274
00:25:11,431 --> 00:25:17,195
the machine. Though Cheshire vowed revenge against
him, Roy and the newly-healed Jericho decided

275
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:23,178
to reform the Titans' team. In post-Flashpoint
continuity, Roy's backstory remained about

276
00:25:23,318 --> 00:25:29,862
80% intact, though his arm was replaced with
an organic replica, and Leon never died. After

277
00:25:29,902 --> 00:25:35,466
forming a team called Iron Rule to overthrow
the Korraki dictatorship, Roy was forced to

278
00:25:35,526 --> 00:25:40,470
kill his teammates when they turned against
him and began killing civilians. For his crimes

279
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:46,475
against Korraki, Roy was sentenced to death,
though he was rescued by the Red Hood and Starfire,

280
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:51,119
both of whom you can learn more about in their
respective duels against the Punisher and Sunspot.

281
00:25:51,459 --> 00:25:56,263
Together, the three formed a team known as the
Outlaws, taking on the likes of the Joker in

282
00:25:56,303 --> 00:26:01,159
Gotham City and the League of Assassins around
the world. world. When Wally West returned

283
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:07,224
to continuity, Roy and the original Titans reformed
the team, though Wally would accidentally cause

284
00:26:07,304 --> 00:26:13,009
Roy's death later during a speed force explosion
incident at a therapeutic resource center for

285
00:26:13,069 --> 00:26:17,773
superheroes known as the Sanctuary, where Roy
was getting treatment for his addictive nature.

286
00:26:18,253 --> 00:26:23,698
He was eventually resurrected via a black lantern
ring, but he was able to overcome its influence

287
00:26:23,738 --> 00:26:29,090
through his love for his daughter, Leon, and
help from his former teammate, Jade. Roy eventually

288
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:34,511
reunited with Leon, learning that she had become
a young vigilante on her own, known as Cheshire

289
00:26:34,591 --> 00:26:40,373
Cat. Well, he, Black Canary, and Green Arrow's
son, searched for a Green Arrow who had become

290
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:44,254
lost in the timestream along with the rest of
the Justice League. That's pretty much his

291
00:26:44,294 --> 00:26:50,676
backstory so far. Powers-wise, Arsenal has no
superhuman ability outside of his uncanny speed

292
00:26:50,836 --> 00:26:56,177
and precision with ranged weaponry. He's an
accomplished technician, having developed many

293
00:26:56,217 --> 00:27:01,520
of Green Arrow's trick arrows including ones
that are explosive, electrified, cryogenic,

294
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,783
contain knockout gas, smoke, adhesive resin,
and neural scrambling waves, just to name a

295
00:27:07,843 --> 00:27:12,846
few. And though he's among the best archers
in the world, unlike his mentor Green Arrow,

296
00:27:13,266 --> 00:27:18,729
Arsenal employs other weapons such as handguns,
rifles, grenades, crossbows, darts, daggers,

297
00:27:19,129 --> 00:27:24,932
and other throwing blades. He is literally a
walking arsenal, on top of being an expert

298
00:27:24,972 --> 00:27:32,236
in close quarters combat and strategy. His only
weakness is, well, heroin. But he's working

299
00:27:32,296 --> 00:27:37,299
on that. Well, I hear that White Widow has some
contacts in the underground drug trade, so

300
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,943
you might be screwed. I'm sorry, is she regularly
carrying heroin on her? Why do you think they

301
00:27:42,983 --> 00:27:47,445
call her the White Widow? Oh, shit. It's one
of those slang words that Deadpool knows about.

302
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:52,869
I doubt that. I think you just made that up.
But let me go ahead and tell you the real backstory

303
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:58,997
of White Widow. Now little is known about the
early life of Yelena Belova, who was born to

304
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:05,283
unknown parents in Russia. At age 15, she attracted
the attention of the Soviet Red Room, who recruited

305
00:28:05,323 --> 00:28:10,327
her into their Black Widow program, training
her to be an elite spy for 10 years. While

306
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:14,711
in the program, she constantly held herself
to the standard of the Red Room's most infamous

307
00:28:14,771 --> 00:28:20,396
Black Widow, a spy by the name of Natasha Romanoff,
who had defected from Russia to join the American

308
00:28:20,436 --> 00:28:25,307
group of heroes known as the Avengers. You can
learn more about Natasha in our Black Canary

309
00:28:25,347 --> 00:28:31,130
vs Black Widow duel episode. Yelena's marks
exceeded Natasha's while in the program, and

310
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:36,493
after succeeding in a test to avenge the death
of her mentor, Yelena graduated from the Red

311
00:28:36,533 --> 00:28:42,657
Room. Sent out as Russia's new elite spy, Yelena
shadowed her rival Natasha during a mission

312
00:28:42,697 --> 00:28:47,860
to retrieve a biological weapon. Planning to
kill Natasha and retrieve the weapon for Russia,

313
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,511
she learned that Natasha was onto her all along.
and the two were forced to fight together against

314
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:59,296
one Colonel Khan. In order to teach the ambitious
young Yelena a lesson in what makes a spy,

315
00:28:59,677 --> 00:29:04,160
Natasha brought her into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.
They swapped faces, just like in the movie

316
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:10,766
Face Off, and Natasha went undercover as Yelena
to stop Yelena's handler, a rogue Russian general,

317
00:29:10,946 --> 00:29:16,211
from restarting the Cold War. Disguised as Natasha,
Yelena learned that the general viewed her

318
00:29:16,311 --> 00:29:22,215
as a disposable and naive tool. Feeling betrayed,
Yelena defected from Russia and had her and

319
00:29:22,235 --> 00:29:28,919
Natasha's faces restored, abandoning their rivalry.
She retired from being a spy to Havana, Cuba,

320
00:29:29,179 --> 00:29:33,862
where she became a model and ran a safe house
that she used to help shelter Natasha while

321
00:29:33,882 --> 00:29:38,784
she was on the run. Yelena teamed up with Daredevil
to rescue Natasha when she was captured by

322
00:29:38,824 --> 00:29:43,687
a cosmetics agency known as Gainacon who was
using pheromone triggers acquired from the

323
00:29:43,727 --> 00:29:49,082
Russian Red Room and its products to manipulate
women around the world. Returning to life as

324
00:29:49,122 --> 00:29:54,363
a spy, Yelena joined SHIELD where she became
part of a rogue faction that was illegally

325
00:29:54,423 --> 00:30:00,385
mining Antarctic vibranium down near the South
Pole in an area called the Savage Land. There

326
00:30:00,645 --> 00:30:06,227
she was attacked by a villain named Soron who
burned and disfigured her body. While in intensive

327
00:30:06,267 --> 00:30:11,088
care, Yelena was approached by Hydra who offered
to restore her appearance by outfitting her

328
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:16,899
with cybernetics, giving her the powers of the
superadaptoid. villainous robot with the ability

329
00:30:16,939 --> 00:30:22,623
to alter its appearance and take on the powers
of others. In turn, Yelena was tasked with

330
00:30:22,684 --> 00:30:28,308
destroying the Avengers. She nearly succeeded,
taking on the power of the Sentry, but was

331
00:30:28,348 --> 00:30:34,213
defeated by subsequently taking on the Sentry's
villainous alter ego, The Void, which drove

332
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:39,357
her insane. Seeing that she had failed her mission,
Hydra killed her. You can learn more about

333
00:30:39,397 --> 00:30:45,026
the Sentry in this duel episode against General
Zod. The evil science organization AIM was

334
00:30:45,086 --> 00:30:50,449
able to use Yelena's Adaptoid components to
revive her body, and they manipulated her into

335
00:30:50,509 --> 00:30:55,311
joining AIM. After stealing the Iron Patriot
armor on behalf of the evil scientists she

336
00:30:55,371 --> 00:31:00,914
worked for, Yelena became an enemy of SHIELD,
who sent Natasha after her former protege.

337
00:31:01,354 --> 00:31:06,797
This time, Yelena was able to overcome her fellow
Black Widow using her super Adaptoid powers.

338
00:31:07,258 --> 00:31:13,081
But Natasha was rescued by the Avenger Hawkeye.
When AIM captured Hawkeye's ex-wife, a spy

339
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:19,159
named Mockingbird, she and Yelena fought. When
it appeared that Mockingbird was victorious,

340
00:31:19,699 --> 00:31:25,440
AIM had her shot. However, it was later revealed
that during the fight, Mockingbird used a holographic

341
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,482
image inducer to alter Yelena's appearance,
and Yelena was the one that AIM had killed.

342
00:31:30,882 --> 00:31:36,323
The Russian Red Room then enacted a program
to revive their best agents via genetic cloning.

343
00:31:36,683 --> 00:31:42,005
This included Natasha, who at the time was also
dead. Regaining her original memories from

344
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:49,120
Epsilon The Natasha clones sought to shut down
the program by using three amnesiac clones

345
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:54,684
of Yelena to help destroy the facility and the
genetic samples. Only one of Yelena's clones

346
00:31:54,724 --> 00:31:59,687
survived, who was given the original's memories
from the Red Room psychic as well. Back in

347
00:31:59,747 --> 00:32:05,051
control of her life, Yelena became a mercenary
spy known as the White Widow, and went on a

348
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:11,070
mission to break the Russian hero Red Guardian
out of captivity. Together, They rescued Natasha

349
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:15,152
and broke her out of her brainwashing from her
enemies that made her forget her life as a

350
00:32:15,212 --> 00:32:20,876
spy. Both Yelena and the Red Guardian later
joined the new Thunderbolts team led by the

351
00:32:20,916 --> 00:32:26,258
Winter Soldier, a former Captain America sidekick
turned Russian assassin turned hero whom you

352
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:31,621
can learn more about in our Red Robin vs. Winter
Soldier duel episode. Together, the Thunderbolts

353
00:32:31,661 --> 00:32:36,184
took on and defeated the Red Skull, a villain
you can learn more about in his duel against

354
00:32:36,284 --> 00:32:42,554
Rosal Gull. And that's Yelena's backstory. Abilities-wise,
White Widow has been vigorously trained in

355
00:32:42,574 --> 00:32:48,056
the Soviet Red Room to be one of Marvel's premier
operatives. She is a master in multiple styles

356
00:32:48,096 --> 00:32:53,037
of fighting, and she has biological enhancements
that grant her peak human physicality in terms

357
00:32:53,077 --> 00:32:59,379
of strength, speed, agility, endurance, and
durability. She is an experienced spy, tactician,

358
00:32:59,659 --> 00:33:05,361
hacker, and markswoman. Her costume provides
resilience to small arms fire, and her specialized

359
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:10,895
bracelets contain a variety of weapons and gadgets
from which she can shoot grapple lines, gas

360
00:33:10,935 --> 00:33:17,799
pellets, and a blast of 30,000 volts of electricity
called a widow's bite. On her person, she also

361
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:23,802
carries combat knives, handguns, and lock picks.
And that's White Widow. So basically, she's

362
00:33:23,862 --> 00:33:30,806
like a less armed version of Arsenal. Sweet.
A less armed but better in every other way

363
00:33:31,146 --> 00:33:35,329
version of Arsenal, yes. What? That's correct.
We'll find out, I guess. All I'll say is that

364
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:42,304
she's never done heroin. Wow. How judgmental,
you judgmental piece of shit. Remember kids,

365
00:33:42,324 --> 00:33:42,885
don't do drugs.

373

debate and settle the score.

374
00:34:37,611 --> 00:34:41,073
Now that we got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

375
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:46,977
of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not the speculation,

376
00:34:47,237 --> 00:34:51,880
but it's fun to imagine how the fight could
play out. AJ and IK, what are the rules of

377
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:56,883
our speculation? Well, I should say there are
no rules, other than the characters have no

378
00:34:56,944 --> 00:35:01,507
prior knowledge of the other going into the
fight. All they are aware of starting out is

379
00:35:01,547 --> 00:35:07,746
that the other character is a threat that needs
to be eliminated. contestants will begin approximately

380
00:35:07,806 --> 00:35:12,967
50 meters apart in a nondescript environment
that will have no bearing on the match itself

381
00:35:13,287 --> 00:35:18,009
as no environmental statistics are considered
in my simulations the contestants must earn

382
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:23,590
victory on their own merit. Alright then let's
get into it. Arsenal and White Widow meet on

383
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:28,932
the battlefield who goes first? Wait let me
answer that. Arsenal goes first. Like they

384
00:35:28,952 --> 00:35:38,559
don't call him speedy for nothing. Alright.
So Arsenal has already drawn duel handguns

385
00:35:38,899 --> 00:35:44,501
and shot her twice in the chest. All right.
Except White Widow's spy suit is made entirely

386
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:48,343
out of Kevlar. So the bullets are going to hit
her. They're going to knock her down, but she's

387
00:35:48,423 --> 00:35:53,325
not dead. She's still alive and she's going
to go into like agility mode, you know, just

388
00:35:53,365 --> 00:35:59,207
sliding across the floor and handspringing up
to her feet. And while she's in mid handspring,

389
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:06,818
she's going to fire a gas pellet, a cyanide
gas pellet at Arsenal. and the gas pellet breaks

390
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:12,940
on him and Arsenal breathes in the cyanide gas
and his lungs just burn up. Actually, Arsenal's

391
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,281
going to shoot that capsule before it even gets
close to him. So now there's this like small

392
00:36:18,401 --> 00:36:23,703
cyanide cloud between them and as White Widow,
you know, is doing hand springs across the

393
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:29,184
environment, he's going to holster his guns
and he's going to draw his bow and he's going

394
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:34,802
to fire a glue arrow at her hand just as it
touches the ground. And so her hand is just

395
00:36:34,862 --> 00:36:39,265
stuck there. How does he even know where to
shoot if there's this cyanide cloud in between

396
00:36:39,285 --> 00:36:44,148
them blocking their line of sight? I said it
was a small cloud, you know, plus she's moving

397
00:36:44,188 --> 00:36:50,353
around. So, you know, it's not blocking him
for very long. OK. All right. Well, if he can

398
00:36:50,373 --> 00:36:56,517
see her, then White Widow can see Arsenal firing
this arrow and like a fucking badass, White

399
00:36:56,537 --> 00:37:01,320
Widow is going to catch the arrow midair because
she's an elite spy. OK, she's not going to

400
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:06,243
get shot with some goo like a chump. And as
she catches the arrow, she's going to immediately

401
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:11,568
hurl the arrow back at Arsenal. And the glue
arrow is going to hit his holster so that he's

402
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:16,672
not able to draw one of his guns anymore. She's
that good. Like, she could hurl an arrow that

403
00:37:16,812 --> 00:37:22,737
accurately and that fast. She's that good. OK,
let's say that happens. Let's say Arsenal doesn't

404
00:37:22,857 --> 00:37:27,821
somehow manage to shoot a thrown arrow out of
the air, just like he did with the capsule.

405
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:33,025
That's fine. You know, because that's just one
gun out of an entire arsenal that he still

406
00:37:33,065 --> 00:37:39,076
has. So he's tired of her flipping and diving
around. So he's going to knock a bola arrow

407
00:37:39,336 --> 00:37:44,479
that's tied to a line. And she gets wrapped
up in it, falling to the ground. At which point

408
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:50,142
he's just going to reel her toward him like
a fish on a hook. Except White Widow is a master

409
00:37:50,162 --> 00:37:54,525
escape artist. She can slip out of anything.
So she slips out of being wrapped up by this

410
00:37:54,645 --> 00:38:00,868
bola. And at this point, she's within ass kicking
distance of Arsenal. So she's just going to

411
00:38:00,888 --> 00:38:05,347
proceed to kick his ass. She's going to grab
his arm. and she's gonna twist it, flipping

412
00:38:05,387 --> 00:38:10,271
him onto the ground. And then she's gonna step
on his back and just break his arm in like

413
00:38:10,451 --> 00:38:16,356
four different places. Well, I'm sorry to inform
you that she in fact grabbed his prosthetic

414
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:24,723
arm. Fuck! So, she's holding his arm and Arsenal,
he's just gonna lay down his own ass kicking

415
00:38:24,883 --> 00:38:29,787
on her, but with a knife in his good hand. And
that's gonna allow him to like sever tendons

416
00:38:29,987 --> 00:38:34,895
in her arms and legs. That's going to slow down
her movement. No, I mean, he might get one

417
00:38:34,935 --> 00:38:42,061
good slash in there on her arm, but Arsenal
is now literally fighting one handed. So White

418
00:38:42,101 --> 00:38:46,525
Widow is going to use her other arm that didn't
just get stabbed to put Arsenal in a wrist

419
00:38:46,585 --> 00:38:51,789
lock, forcing him to drop the knife, which she's
going to catch midair before it hits the ground.

420
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:58,355
And like in one smooth motion, she's going to
stab that knife right into his thigh. OK, like

421
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:03,218
Aria from Game of Thrones style. Yeah, yes,
exactly. Okay, but I mean, she's going to have

422
00:39:03,238 --> 00:39:08,879
to drop his prosthetic arm while doing that.
And, you know, since Arsenal, you know, he

423
00:39:08,939 --> 00:39:14,641
needs to reattach the arm and he'll need some
distance and some time to do that. This is

424
00:39:14,681 --> 00:39:20,683
where he's going to snatch a cryo arrow from
his quiver. He's going to slam that into White

425
00:39:20,703 --> 00:39:26,705
Widow's back, freezing her torso. So she's going
to be in shock. And that's when Arsenal is

426
00:39:26,725 --> 00:39:32,067
going to reattach his arm and pull the knife
out of his thigh. Okay, so White Widow is in

427
00:39:32,107 --> 00:39:37,390
shock from having her torso frozen, but she's
trained for this. You know, she's from Russia.

428
00:39:37,931 --> 00:39:43,054
I'm sure she's been out in those Siberian winters.
She probably knows what it's like to be frozen.

429
00:39:43,194 --> 00:39:46,676
So she's going to assess the situation quickly.
It's not going to affect her too much. And

430
00:39:46,716 --> 00:39:51,219
yeah, she's not going to be able to move around
as much, but she can still move her arm. And

431
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:57,344
while Arsenal is attaching his prosthetic, Zap!
He gets shot with 30,000 volts of electricity

432
00:39:57,464 --> 00:40:03,274
to his forehead with White Widow's, Widow's
and it's going to fry his brain and end this

433
00:40:03,314 --> 00:40:12,237
match because he's not faster than fucking electricity.
Damn. Uh, the thing is, though, Arsenal saw

434
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:17,859
her aiming at him, so he just moved slightly,
like just in time, just enough so that the

435
00:40:17,919 --> 00:40:23,720
widow's bite just knocks off the ball cap that,
you know, he usually wears. And with the knife

436
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:28,102
in his hand that he pulled from his thigh, he's
just going to flick that into her neck. and

437
00:40:28,142 --> 00:40:33,723
that's gonna sever her spinal column like a
damn surgeon. So unfortunately for you, she

438
00:40:33,803 --> 00:40:39,305
is the one that is dead. You mean unfortunately
for you, Arsenal was already electrocuted before

439
00:40:39,345 --> 00:40:45,366
he could even do that. Why? What do you mean
why? Why not? Because he saw her aiming her

440
00:40:45,566 --> 00:40:50,428
arm at him because she fires those from her
wrist bracelets, right? Yeah, so? He doesn't

441
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:54,949
know what they do. No, she knows that she's
gonna shoot something from them. He doesn't

442
00:40:54,969 --> 00:41:01,689
know that she has widow bites. He doesn't know
shit. Agree to disagree, but I guess we can

443
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:08,874
leave the match there. Either Arsenal gets his
brain fried by her widow's bite, or she gets

444
00:41:08,994 --> 00:41:14,578
a knife thrown through her neck. Damn. Let's
go ahead and input the character stats, run

445
00:41:14,598 --> 00:41:20,763
the simulations, and come back with a winner.
Adrian 9K, hit it. Inputting data, running

446
00:41:20,783 --> 00:41:26,947
calculations, processing results, simulations
complete. All right, this was a really good

447
00:41:27,007 --> 00:41:32,291
matchup. I didn't realize the characters had
as many background similarities in being both

448
00:41:32,331 --> 00:41:37,095
hero and villain and being both spies and stuff
like that. But they also were pretty similar

449
00:41:37,115 --> 00:41:42,100
when it came to their stats as well. Yeah, I
knew right off the bat that Arsenal was going

450
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:47,204
to have an advantage over White Widow when it
came to damage level. And I knew that he would

451
00:41:47,224 --> 00:41:51,647
probably have her when it came to range as well,
just because, you know, being a marksman is

452
00:41:51,707 --> 00:41:57,100
all that he has. And he has a vast arsenal as
well. But White Widow did have a few stats

453
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:03,045
over Arsenal, including fighting skill and intelligence.
Yeah, they went a little bit tit for tat in

454
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:09,590
the stats, but any time one of them came out
on top, it was just barely so. Like when it

455
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:14,835
came to a lot of the physical stats like speed,
evasiveness, durability, strength, they were

456
00:42:14,995 --> 00:42:22,081
even. Surprisingly, because I thought speedy
would be speedier. So taking all of this into

457
00:42:22,121 --> 00:42:26,671
consideration. Joseph, who do you think came
out on top in this match? I think it's going

458
00:42:26,691 --> 00:42:31,994
to be White Widow, because I think they're pretty
evenly matched, and I think Luck is just on

459
00:42:32,054 --> 00:42:37,117
White Widow's side. Oh, I'm sorry, we do not
have a Luck stat, so that is completely moot.

460
00:42:37,617 --> 00:42:43,460
Will our Instagram followers agree with me?
In our poll, 53% said that White Widow would

461
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:48,903
be Arsenal. Now, to be fair, though, I put up
that poll super late. So there's still a chance

462
00:42:48,923 --> 00:42:51,825
that Arsenal could come out on top. If people
thought Arsenal would win, they would vote

463
00:42:51,845 --> 00:42:58,645
for him. I don't want to hear your excuses.
All right, well, AJ 9K, the results, please.

464
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:08,352
Here you are, sir. The winner of the matchup
between Arsenal and White Widow is... Arsenal!

465
00:43:08,853 --> 00:43:17,599
He won 54.6% of the 1000 matches compared to
White Widow, who only won 45.4% or 454 total

466
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:26,615
wins compared to Arsenal's 546%. But where does
the drug dependency stat come into play? Cause

467
00:43:26,675 --> 00:43:33,417
I feel like at any given moment, it's most likely
that Arsenal is just smacked up on heroin and

468
00:43:33,597 --> 00:43:38,038
White Widow barely has to do anything to even
try. He's kicked the habit often enough where

469
00:43:38,218 --> 00:43:42,539
I don't think that would be the case. Uh, what
you didn't account for, and I think why this

470
00:43:42,559 --> 00:43:46,900
is an appropriate win is that even during our
speculation, like I didn't unleash Arsenal's

471
00:43:47,201 --> 00:43:53,824
full Arsenal, like I didn't use anything explosive.
I didn't pull out any crossbows or rifles.

472
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:58,287
Well, White Widow has explosives too. Yeah,
but they can't go as far as Arsenaals can.

473
00:43:58,628 --> 00:44:04,693
You don't know that? Yeah, I do. Okay. I like
100% know that. All right. So yeah, Arsenaal

474
00:44:04,713 --> 00:44:10,458
wins. Go team DC. After that long break of duel
episodes as we were doing reviews, it's nice

475
00:44:10,478 --> 00:44:15,262
to come back to a duel episode and get the win.
And it will be nice for me to come back in

476
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:19,565
our next duel episode after this one and teach
you a lesson. What is the next duel episode?

477
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:25,475
Our next duel episode is going to be the team
duel, Outsiders vs X-Force. That's right. But

478
00:44:25,495 --> 00:44:29,479
that's not going to be next week, that's going
to be in a couple weeks. Right, our next episode

479
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:35,506
is actually going to be a review of Suicide
Squad Isekai, the television series, and we're

480
00:44:35,526 --> 00:44:39,570
going to bring on a special guest for that.
So look forward to that next week, but that

481
00:44:39,610 --> 00:44:47,256
does it for this duel. AJ9K, help close us out.
