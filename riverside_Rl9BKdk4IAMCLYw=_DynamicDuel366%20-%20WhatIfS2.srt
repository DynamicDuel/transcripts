00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,957
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,682 --> 00:00:30,427
the Dynamic Dual Podcast, a weekly show where
we review superhero films and debate the superiority

3
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:36,012
between Marvel and DC by comparing their characters
and stat-based battle simulations. I'm Johnny

4
00:00:36,052 --> 00:00:41,477
DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous Joe.
And in this episode, we are reviewing the second

5
00:00:41,517 --> 00:00:48,303
season of the Disney Plus MCU animated series
What If. Of course, the show ended last year.

6
00:00:48,584 --> 00:00:52,062
We're barely getting around to reviewing it
now. But literally it was just like a week

7
00:00:52,082 --> 00:00:55,844
and a half ago, so we'll let you guys know what
we thought about the show later on this episode.

8
00:00:55,884 --> 00:00:59,066
Before that we're going to break down the latest
comic book movie news to come out this past

9
00:00:59,106 --> 00:01:04,589
week. Of which there was really only one news
item, which is that Steven Yeun has exited

10
00:01:04,609 --> 00:01:09,092
the Thunderbolt film. As always we list our
segment times in our episode description, so

11

out of the way, quick to the No Prize! A No

36
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:29,505
Prize is an award Marvel used to give out to
fans. Our version, the Dynamic Dual No Prize,

37
00:03:29,785 --> 00:03:34,229
is a digital award we post on Instagram and
in our email newsletter for the person that

38
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:39,233
we feel gave the best answer to our question
of the week. Last week we asked, now that the

39
00:03:39,293 --> 00:03:48,064
DCEU is finished, what would you say are the
top three DCEU and why. We only received two

40
00:03:48,164 --> 00:03:53,648
answers but it's okay because we have an honorable
mention and a winner to announce. The honorable

41
00:03:53,688 --> 00:04:00,634
mention goes to Connor Pierce who said Connor
Pierce- Hi guys, I think Shazam, Wonder Woman,

42
00:04:01,235 --> 00:04:12,024
and Black Adam are the top three best DCEU films
of all time. They are just so good and Shazam

43
00:04:12,144 --> 00:04:19,667
is one of the better ones because had Zachary
Levi in it and Asher Angel and I think that

44
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:25,809
they need to do more movies like that. Thanks
guys. Yeah so Shazam, Wonder Woman, and Black

45
00:04:25,909 --> 00:04:31,750
Adam are actually a pretty good trifecta of
quality that DC has put out. I know a lot of

46
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,212
people didn't like Black Adam but the superhero
action in that movie was top-notch and it was

47
00:04:36,312 --> 00:04:41,233
really cool to get to see the Justice Society
on screen. Yeah for some reason people give

48
00:04:41,273 --> 00:04:45,211
Black Adam shit but... Even as a Marvel guy,
someone who doesn't really care about the DC

49
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:48,913
characters, I had a lot of fun with it. It wasn't
like groundbreaking, well, like maybe in terms

50
00:04:48,953 --> 00:04:55,356
of like PG-13 superhero violence, but it totally
worked for what it was trying to be. Yeah,

51
00:04:55,476 --> 00:04:59,778
it would have been nice if Shazam was in the
movie, but of course Shazam already had a really

52
00:04:59,818 --> 00:05:04,420
good film. It was a great origin story, a great
movie with family themes, and it was funny,

53
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:09,095
probably one of the most funny films in the
DCEU. and Wonder Woman of course was extremely

54
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:14,059
well made by Patty Jenkins. I loved the World
War I setting for that first film. The sequel

55
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,502
didn't quite hold up, but the first Wonder Woman
film absolutely is one of the DCEU's best.

56
00:05:18,963 --> 00:05:23,246
Yeah, as far as I'm concerned, Wonder Woman
is like Oscar caliber. I don't think it won

57
00:05:23,286 --> 00:05:29,171
any, but it's Oscar caliber in my book. Great
answer is Connor, but the winner of this week's

58
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:36,297
No Prize is Abner O'Terry, who said, Oh, this
is Abner O'Terry. My answers would have to

59
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:41,192
be Blue Beetle. because of his connection with
his family. Black Adam, because you get to

60
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:48,956
see the Justice Society of America. And then
Snyder Cut of Justice League, because you get

61
00:05:48,976 --> 00:05:53,859
to see the whole Justice League together. And
they're awesome. Thank you. Yeah, so I thought

62
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:59,242
Blue Beetle was the best DC film of last year.
Spoiler alert, if you haven't listened to last

63
00:05:59,282 --> 00:06:03,265
week's episode of the Brothers Awards yet. But
yeah, I really enjoyed that movie. It actually

64
00:06:03,325 --> 00:06:09,411
reminded me a lot. of the Shazam movie in that
it was comedic, action packed, and had strong

65
00:06:09,431 --> 00:06:14,814
family values. But the real reason that this
answer gets the win is because I think the

66
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:21,476
best DC movie ever made is Zack Snyder's Justice
League. You had to get a Zack Snyder film in

67
00:06:21,496 --> 00:06:26,378
there for as much hate as the director and his
films get. I still think that could have been

68
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:32,501
a masterful cinematic universe if Warner Brothers
had just let him create it. I don't know man,

69
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:38,703
have you heard the reviews for Rebel Moon? The
fuck do I care about that for? Hehe

70
00:07:02,162 --> 00:07:07,044
And then it's like a three way tie between Wonder
Woman, Aquaman and Shazam. And I don't know

71
00:07:07,064 --> 00:07:11,165
if I'd probably go Aquaman or Wonder Woman on
that one. Yeah, the DCEU had some really good

72
00:07:11,205 --> 00:07:16,647
films and it will be missed now that it's over.
That said, I am really looking forward to seeing

73
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:21,409
what James Gunn brings us next year. We have
to wait a whole damn year. Sucks. But great

74
00:07:21,469 --> 00:07:25,951
answer, Abner O'Terry. You win this week's no
prize. If you the listener want a shot at winning

75
00:07:25,991 --> 00:07:30,313
your own no prize, stay tuned to later on in
this episode, where we'll be asking another

76
00:07:30,593 --> 00:07:34,368
question of the week. And now that that's done,
on to the news!

77
00:07:39,938 --> 00:07:44,461
Alright, this past week we learned that Steven
Yeun will not be playing the Sentry in the

78
00:07:44,581 --> 00:07:49,886
upcoming Thunderbolts film. It was never actually
officially announced by Marvel Studios that

79
00:07:49,926 --> 00:07:55,730
Yeun was cast as the Sentry, but it was almost
all but confirmed. The reason that Yeun is

80
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:01,135
leaving that movie is because, according to
him, scheduling conflicts due to the writer

81
00:08:01,175 --> 00:08:05,698
and actor's strikes. We know that the strikes
caused the Thunderbolts film to be pushed from

82
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:12,739
July 2024 to July 2025, a whole year back. And
yeah, that can always create conflicts for

83
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:17,381
actors who try to squeeze in multiple projects.
Yeah, when I first heard this news, I was actually

84
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:23,004
pretty bummed. I was like, what scheduling conflicts?
Like, what could possibly top starring in a

85
00:08:23,064 --> 00:08:28,647
Marvel movie? But it sounds like he's pretty
bummed. And he said that he still hopes to

86
00:08:28,787 --> 00:08:35,178
one day star in an MCU film, which is nice.
Yeah. I mean, he's a fantastic actor. and I

87
00:08:35,218 --> 00:08:38,879
think Marvel would be lucky to have him in any
role, really. He was always an interesting

88
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,881
choice for the Sentry. He never quite resembled
the character from the comic books, who's like

89
00:08:43,921 --> 00:08:48,283
this white blonde-haired guy, but taking it
in the direction of Yen entirely works, and

90
00:08:48,323 --> 00:08:52,905
I think it would have been a fantastic performance
because Yen is just such a quality actor. Yeah,

91
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:57,627
honestly, like, the Sentry is not a well-enough
known character, where I think anyone would

92
00:08:57,647 --> 00:09:02,169
have been up in arms over colorblind casting.
I thought it was a really good choice because

93
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:06,984
first and foremost, You want a quality actor
who would be able to capture the psychological

94
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:13,728
complexity of a character like Robert Reynolds,
aka the Sentry. Aka the Void. Yeah, there's

95
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:18,210
a great duality to the character of the Sentry
that I think Yun would have been fantastic

96
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:23,954
playing. So it's a shame I don't think that
this casting change is going to alter the plot

97
00:09:23,994 --> 00:09:27,596
of the movie at all. I still think we're going
to get the Sentry character within the film.

98
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:32,130
So it'll be interesting to see who they cast
for that. going forward, you'd think we'd get

99
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:35,951
a casting announcement soon, considering that
they should start filming here in a few months.

100
00:09:36,071 --> 00:09:39,352
Yeah, I mean, Marvel's pretty secretive, so
I wouldn't be surprised if they held the back

101
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:44,114
of the news until, like, Comic-Con. Like they'll
cast someone, but they won't say what character

102
00:09:44,134 --> 00:09:47,735
they're playing until, you know, they're ready
for some huge announcement. You're probably

103
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:52,717
right about that. We'll see. But on the subject
of this entry's casting, that brings us to

104
00:09:52,737 --> 00:09:53,717
our question of the week.

105
00:09:58,262 --> 00:10:02,923
Who would you cast as the Sentry in the MCU's
Thunderbolts film? Now that Steven Yeun's out

106
00:10:02,943 --> 00:10:06,925
of the picture, we'd like to hear who you guys
think would make an awesome Sentry. If you

107
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:11,567

113

January 13th.

114
00:10:39,822 --> 00:10:43,707
I think that does it for all the news for this
episode. Now let's move on to the main event,

115
00:10:43,987 --> 00:10:49,635
where we review the Disney Plus animated Marvel
series, What If, season two.

116
00:11:05,838 --> 00:11:11,262
Season 2 is an animated series on Disney+, directed
by Brian Andrews, written by A.C. Bradley,

117
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:15,926
and starring many familiar names and voices
from the live-action Marvel Cinematic Universe.

118
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:21,430
Based on the What If comic books, the show explores
the multiverse with a series of anthological

119
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,853
tales told from the perspective of The Watcher,
who is the cosmic entity that oversees the

120
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:31,246
events happening in each episode. Each story
is set up with a question of what if. that

121
00:11:31,286 --> 00:11:36,327
explores how a single change in the primary
MCU timeline would affect continuity and unfolds

122
00:11:36,367 --> 00:11:41,369
the universal effects from that change. The
season is the follow-up to the first season

123
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:46,090
which we reviewed on the show a few years ago,
saying that while the show has a great premise,

124
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,451
the first season squandered its potential with
a hit or miss run of episodes, some that felt

125
00:11:50,691 --> 00:11:56,373
so pointless that I felt more like asking but
why? When watching them. Exactly like Party

126
00:11:56,413 --> 00:12:00,881
Thor. Yeah. That being said, I thought that
this second season improved upon the first

127
00:12:01,041 --> 00:12:05,606
one and chose to tell more interesting tales
and therefore is actually more worth your time.

128
00:12:05,626 --> 00:12:10,531
With that in mind, if you haven't watched What
If Season 2 yet, be sure to do so before listening

129
00:12:10,551 --> 00:12:16,096
to this review because we will be delving into
spoilers. All the reviews that we do on the

130
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:20,739
show are spoiler heavy. Now one of the criticisms
that we said about the premise of the What

131
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:25,462
If show was that it inherently doesn't require
much investment on behalf of the audience because

132
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:30,145
any anthological exploration outside of the
primary universe is just a sandbox that writers

133
00:12:30,185 --> 00:12:34,927
can let thrive or destroy and it technically
doesn't affect anything that matters to the

134
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:40,411
primary timeline. Because we don't have to care,
sometimes it's hard to, but this season didn't

135
00:12:40,431 --> 00:12:45,193
feel pointless because of the worthwhile stories
they chose to explore. Yeah, no, I mean...

136
00:12:45,726 --> 00:12:50,848
Whether they affect the main timeline or not
to me was never really too much of the draw

137
00:12:50,928 --> 00:12:55,851
of What If. I like Elseworld Tales, What If
Tales. They're some of my favorite stories

138
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:59,753
because you're able to do things with characters
that you would never be able to get away with

139
00:12:59,953 --> 00:13:05,356
in the Prime Continuity timeline. My issue with
the first season of What If was that I didn't

140
00:13:05,397 --> 00:13:10,499
think that the questions they asked, as you
mentioned, were worth asking in any way and

141
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:14,978
I will agree with you that this season asked
much more interesting questions. Yeah, I think

142
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:20,099
in hindsight, Season 1 was trying too hard to
set up its Guardians of the Multiverse team

143
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,841
in its final episode, prioritizing that roster
over telling good stories. Because of that,

144
00:13:25,881 --> 00:13:32,924
we got such duds from Season 1 as T'Challa Star-Lord,
Party Thor, and who I like to call a more convoluted

145
00:13:32,964 --> 00:13:38,474
Killmonger that were less interesting versions
of what was in the main MCU timeline. In season

146
00:13:38,574 --> 00:13:44,036
2 however, the overarching narrative only played
out as ending scenes in a couple of episodes

147
00:13:44,136 --> 00:13:49,618
before the finale with Doctor Strange Supreme.
Beyond him, there were only two other characters

148
00:13:49,638 --> 00:13:53,500
that mattered to the finale which were Captain
Carter and the newcomer character, Kihori.

149
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,302
And because the show had more freedom, it could
explore better concepts in its other episodes.

150
00:13:59,462 --> 00:14:03,124
I think that made all the difference in the
world for this season. Yeah, a lot of the Guardians

151
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:07,265
of the Multiverse weren't even in the season
at all, which I think worked for it as a whole.

152
00:14:07,762 --> 00:14:12,043
Absolutely, yeah. And while the first season
had some concepts that married classic films

153
00:14:12,063 --> 00:14:16,404
with multiversal events such as The Night of
the Living Dead in the Marvel Zombies episode

154
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:22,186
or Risky Business with the Party Thor episode,
the second season did it with greater success,

155
00:14:22,406 --> 00:14:27,247
I think with episodes taking cues from movies
like Blade Runner, Mad Max, Fury Road, and

156
00:14:27,307 --> 00:14:31,888
Die Hard. I really liked that how they were
able to merge other pop culture stuff with

157
00:14:31,948 --> 00:14:37,118
Marvel and interesting ways in alternate universes.
And they weren't shy about it either. Like

158
00:14:37,158 --> 00:14:43,062
they explicitly were mentioning characters from
Die Hard in that Christmas episode. Yeah. It's

159
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:47,265
a lot of fun when they do that though. In addition
to the movie homages though, I really like

160
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:53,690
the fact that this season also delved into what-if
tales from the comics, like 1602, which actually

161
00:14:53,770 --> 00:15:00,155
isn't necessarily a what-if story, but it is
an Elseworlds alternate universe tale that

162
00:15:00,175 --> 00:15:04,862
Marvel published. Right, yeah. It was written
by Neil Gaiman. and it was a fantastic story

163
00:15:04,902 --> 00:15:09,864
about the Marvel Universe manifesting at the
end of the Renaissance era. This 1602 episode

164
00:15:09,904 --> 00:15:14,226
was nothing like that story, and really didn't
hold a candle to it, honestly, because I thought

165
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:18,608
it was one of the lesser episodes of the season.
But the fact that they're exploring ideas like

166
00:15:18,628 --> 00:15:23,030
that was still fun. Like, there were still great
ideas there. Like, in the comic, Steve Rogers

167
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:29,032
was like a Native American guy. And in this
episode, Steve Rogers was Rogers-hood, a riff

168
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:34,003
on Robin Hood. Even though that should have
been Hawkeye, but... Yeah, you're absolutely

169
00:15:34,063 --> 00:15:38,608
right. I just like the call out to the comics,
you know, I'm glad that they're looking towards

170
00:15:38,628 --> 00:15:43,973
the source material for ideas. Yeah. Usually
I prefer my alternate Unova stories to be wholly

171
00:15:44,013 --> 00:15:48,597
original accounts as opposed to retellings of
familiar tales, which is like one or two minor

172
00:15:48,637 --> 00:15:53,782
changes. Season 2 did something interesting
where they mashed up their own franchises a

173
00:15:53,822 --> 00:15:58,050
bit, like the What If Captain Carter Fought
the Hydra Stomper episode. was essentially

174
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:03,173
a retelling of Captain America the Winter Soldier
that incorporated elements from the Black Widow

175
00:16:03,214 --> 00:16:08,597
film, specifically the Red Room and Melina Vostokov's
work with the Mind Control Agent that worked

176
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:14,421
so well within the concept of Russia manipulating
an old hero that is cherished to the protagonist.

177
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:19,705
I thought that was really well done. Yeah, that
was really cool. Similarly, What If Hela Found

178
00:16:19,725 --> 00:16:24,759
the Ten Rings was basically the first Thor film,
but with Hela as the lead with the setting

179
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:29,320
of medieval China from Shang-Chi and the Legend
of the Ten Rings. Now if Shang-Chi had father

180
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:34,241
issues in his movie, Hela also had father issues.
Thematically, I think it just worked for me.

181
00:16:34,721 --> 00:16:39,383
And I think these mashups were a very interesting
way to approach these stories. Yeah, honestly,

182
00:16:39,763 --> 00:16:44,844
ancient China is way more interesting than modern
day New Mexico. Sorry to all of our listeners

183
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:49,125
from New Mexico. I don't know, man. Did they
have green chili? Hell yeah. Did medieval China

184
00:16:49,165 --> 00:16:55,670
have hatch green chili? You win, that's fair.
It's harder to go into my overall thoughts

185
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,713
on the show without going into specifics on
each episode, so let's go ahead and get into

186
00:16:59,753 --> 00:17:06,179
our episode highlights. Episode 1 was called
What If Nebula Joined the Nobacore? It stars

187
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:11,844
Karen Gillan as Nebula, Jude Law as Yonrog,
Michael Rooker as Yondu, Seth Green as Howard

188
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:17,039
the Duck, and Taika Waititi as Korg. Note that
if I don't see an actor with the character,

189
00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:22,602
it just means that the character was played
by a primarily voice actor who may not be a

190
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:26,425
recognizable name. I just want to point out
when the actual actors from the films portray

191
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:30,987
the same roles in animation. I always really
like that when the actual actor came back to

192
00:17:31,027 --> 00:17:36,810
voice the role. It really helps me decide which
MCU actors are like too stuck up and snobby

193
00:17:37,211 --> 00:17:42,154
to return to the role for animation. You know,
which ones aren't greedy assholes. Yeah. So-

194
00:17:42,346 --> 00:17:46,848
What the heck Robert Downey Jr. Too good for
us or what? Scarlett Johansson, come on! Hahaha.

195
00:17:47,348 --> 00:17:52,771
But in the story for episode 1, in this timeline,
Ronan the Accuser kills Thanos and his forces

196
00:17:52,811 --> 00:17:58,253
wage a campaign against Xandar and the Nova
Corps. Nebula, without purpose after her father's

197
00:17:58,273 --> 00:18:03,276
death, joins the Nova Corps. To protect Xandar
from Ronan, Nova Prime seals it off with a

198
00:18:03,316 --> 00:18:08,915
planetary force field, throwing the population
into chaos. Nebula comes across the murdered

199
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:14,259
body of Yondu, though there is suspiciously
no investigation. Prompted by Nova Prime to

200
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:19,043
covertly look into things, Nebula learns that
Yondu discovered the source code to the planetary

201
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:23,867
shield generator. Believing that an invasion
is in the works, Nebula enlists the help of

202
00:18:23,947 --> 00:18:29,351
Yonrog, a former Kree soldier, to help infiltrate
the Nova Corps mainframe and destroy the codes.

203
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:34,155
He betrays her, however, and steals the codes,
nearly killing her before revealing that he

204
00:18:34,195 --> 00:18:39,663
and Nova Prime plan to give Xandar up to Ronin.
Nebula survives with help from Howard the Duck,

205
00:18:39,844 --> 00:18:44,227
and along with Korg, Groot, and Meek, the group
breaks into the Nova Corps headquarters to

206
00:18:44,267 --> 00:18:48,931
stop the shield opening. It's revealed that
Nebula suspected Nova Prime's intentions through

207
00:18:48,951 --> 00:18:53,454
her unorthodox request to investigate Yondu's
death by any means necessary, and that she

208
00:18:53,614 --> 00:18:58,258
altered the shield codes to close right after
opening to destroy Ronan's ship and stop his

209
00:18:58,298 --> 00:19:03,418
invasion. Nova Prime falls to her death in the
fight, and Xandar is freed. I thought this

210
00:19:03,438 --> 00:19:08,620
was a really strong episode to start the series
with. I really liked it. Not only did I like

211
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:14,063
the Blade Runner aesthetic and the Technonore
genre that it was, but the classic like Houdonnet

212
00:19:14,103 --> 00:19:18,645
mystery was also pretty well done, I thought.
Yeah, it was a little bit convenient that Nebula

213
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:22,747
was on to Novo Prime the entire time and so
everything just kind of neatly fell into place

214
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:27,629
at the end. But you know, it's only like a 30
minute episode and I can forgive it for how

215
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:33,789
cool everything was. Just the environment of
this post-apocalyptic Xandar was really cool.

216
00:19:33,849 --> 00:19:37,172
Yeah, I'm not sure why Jude Law had to be in
this episode. I kind of feel like he was just

217
00:19:37,212 --> 00:19:42,516
filling a contractual obligation. But the rest
of it I thought was great. My favorite part

218
00:19:42,656 --> 00:19:47,580
was when I realized that Korg, Groot, and Meek
was rock, paper, scissors. Like, they were

219
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,763
playing up on that whole thing. I thought that
was funny. Yeah, that was fantastic. I thought

220
00:19:50,783 --> 00:19:56,588
it was really interesting to see how Ronin killing
Thanos meant that the Guardians never formed,

221
00:19:56,708 --> 00:20:02,575
therefore Nebula never joins them. instead joining
a different team, the Nova Corps, and finding

222
00:20:02,615 --> 00:20:07,897
her redemption there. So like, no matter what
path Nebula goes on, it's always within this

223
00:20:08,057 --> 00:20:13,980
family team situation. Yeah, right. Alongside
Howard the Duck in this version, which I thought

224
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,682
was great. I thought Seth Green did a fantastic
job with that role as always. Yeah, he showed

225
00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:23,884
up a few times in season one as well, like in
the Party Thor episode and in T'Challa Star-Lord,

226
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:29,795
but I thought he was best served here as this
casino owner. In all, I give this episode 4

227
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:33,078
stars. So what I'm going to do since this is
like an anthology thing and each episode kind

228
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:38,082
of stands on its own, I'll rate each episode
on a star rating and my overall score for the

229
00:20:38,122 --> 00:20:43,627
season is basically an average of those ratings.
Yeah, I'll agree with 4 stars. Episode 2 is

230
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:48,891
called What If Peter Quill Attacked Earth's
Mightiest Heroes. In it you have Michael Douglas

231
00:20:48,931 --> 00:20:53,976
playing Ant-Man Hink Pym, Lawrence Fishburne,
playing Goliath, aka Bill Foster. Sebastian

232
00:20:54,036 --> 00:20:58,940
Stan returned as the Winter Soldier, aka Bucky
Barnes. Atandwa Connie revisited his role as

233
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,824
T'Chaka, Black Panther. Haley Atwell played
Peggy Carter. John Slattery played Howard Stark.

234
00:21:04,105 --> 00:21:09,209
And Kurt Russell returned as Ego. Kudos to Kurt
Russell for coming back, that was awesome.

235
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:13,693
Yeah, it's really interesting to see these big
name legends come back to do animated work

236
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:17,957
for the MCU, like Michael Douglas. For sure.
They're not too cool for school, Chris Evans.

237
00:21:18,217 --> 00:21:23,999
Right? In this timeline in 1988, the Ravagers
deliver Peter Quill to his father, Ego, who

238
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:29,161
unlocks the child's cosmic powers. Escaping
his father to Earth, Peter crash lands in New

239
00:21:29,181 --> 00:21:33,342
York and makes his way to Missouri, causing
destruction in his path out of self-defense.

240
00:21:33,882 --> 00:21:38,524
In response, Shields Peggy Carter and Howard
Stark assemble an early version of the Avengers,

241
00:21:38,684 --> 00:21:43,886
including Ant-Man, Goliath, the Winter Soldier,
Black Panther, and Captain Mar-Vell. Their

242
00:21:43,906 --> 00:21:48,508
attempts to contain him at Coney Island fail
until Thor intervenes, having tracked Peter

243
00:21:48,588 --> 00:21:52,930
across the cosmos by the destruction left in
his wake. Taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody,

244
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:57,512
Peter is befriended by Ant-Man's kid daughter
Hope, who frees him and informs S.H.I.E.L.D.

245
00:21:57,892 --> 00:22:03,515
about the threat Ego poses. Ego's avatar travels
to Earth after losing communication with Peter,

246
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:08,117
and his arrival is detected by S.H.I.E.L.D.
who sends Black Panther, Goliath, and Thor

247
00:22:08,137 --> 00:22:13,613
to confront the while Ant-Man, Captain Marvel,
and the Winter Soldier find Peter visiting

248
00:22:13,673 --> 00:22:19,338
his mother's grave. As the first group struggles
against Ego's cosmic powers, the latter group

249
00:22:19,398 --> 00:22:23,902
tries to convince Peter to help them against
his father. They join the battle, and Peter

250
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:29,707
harnesses the cosmic power in Ego's expansion
seed to destroy his avatar. The team celebrates

251
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:35,291
their victory and prepares to venture into space
to confront Ego the Planet. I loved this episode!

252
00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:39,654
I thought this was a really, really cool episode.
I love seeing the early Avengers that could

253
00:22:39,674 --> 00:22:44,116
have been. Yeah, the 80s roster. It's interesting
because like you forget how many superpowered

254
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:48,998
beings there were in the MCU's history. It's
kind of a surprise that Nick Fury was the first

255
00:22:49,098 --> 00:22:52,840
one to come up with the Avengers initiative
in the main MCU timeline and that the idea

256
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,762
of assembling these superpowered beings into
a team didn't manifest sooner. Yeah, I agree.

257
00:22:57,782 --> 00:23:02,864
And this was just an awesome roster, too. Yeah,
I liked it a lot. It was nice that Thor actually

258
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:07,574
felt more like Thor again, like he wasn't cracking
jokes at every turn. Exactly. I also liked

259
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:12,037
that Mar-Vell was in there as well in a callback
to Captain Marvel, although I kind of wish

260
00:23:12,197 --> 00:23:16,861
that her Tesseract ship had blown up and she
had received the powers from the Tesseract.

261
00:23:16,881 --> 00:23:20,903
I thought that would have been way cooler. That
would have been awesome. Yeah. I did have the

262
00:23:20,923 --> 00:23:26,447
question of why Peter Quill destroyed other
planets like Jotunheim if Ego wasn't fully

263
00:23:26,487 --> 00:23:30,558
in control of Peter's actions, but that was
never really addressed in this episode. I think

264
00:23:30,598 --> 00:23:33,959
he was just listening to his father. I think
the whole reason he didn't destroy Earth was

265
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:38,382
because it was his home. That's where his mom
lived and he lived when he was younger. Yeah,

266
00:23:38,482 --> 00:23:43,245
that makes sense. I even liked the hope and
young Peter Quill dynamic. You know, I didn't

267
00:23:43,265 --> 00:23:48,227
mind that. Yeah, honestly, I'm kind of pissed
off at fucking Yondu for not delivering Quill.

268
00:23:48,687 --> 00:23:52,169
Yeah, because then Earth would have been equipped
with an Avengers team three decades earlier.

269
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:56,752
Yeah. And a dope one. That was really cool.
I read this episode four stars. I thought it

270
00:23:56,772 --> 00:24:01,247
was really well done. I had a lot of fun despite
questioning why. Thor would struggle against

271
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:06,551
Ego's avatar beings just as much as Black Panther
and less powerful heroes were. That's fair.

272
00:24:06,991 --> 00:24:11,975
I also still feel like Marvel has an issue with
what they're calling a celestial and what they're

273
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:17,980
not. I don't know. Yeah, that whole thing is
weird. Maybe since Ego is a planet and celestials

274
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:22,463
are born within planets, Ego is just like an
alternate version of a celestial, one that

275
00:24:22,603 --> 00:24:27,323
merged into the planet as opposed to erupting
from it. I guess that makes sense. I do really

276
00:24:27,363 --> 00:24:32,648
like Ego as a villain. I like seeing him come
to planet Earth and terrorize heroes here.

277
00:24:32,869 --> 00:24:36,753
I really like this episode. I'm giving it 4
and a half stars. It was one of my favorites.

278
00:24:37,273 --> 00:24:43,320
Episode 3 was called What If Happy Hogan Saved
Christmas. It had Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan

279
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:48,817
aka the Freak, Sam Rockwell, as Justin Hammer,
Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk aka Bruce Banner,

280
00:24:48,977 --> 00:24:54,682
Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye aka Clint Barton, Kobe
Smulders as Maria Hill, Kat Dennings as Darcy

281
00:24:54,742 --> 00:25:00,487
Lewis, Lake Bell as Black Widow aka Natasha
Romanoff, and Chris Hemsworth as Thor. Wait,

282
00:25:00,527 --> 00:25:05,151
you said the Freak. Is that an actual character
from the comics? Yes. In the comics, Happy

283
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:10,396
Hogan was mortally injured at one point and
Tony Stark used some experimental technology

284
00:25:10,516 --> 00:25:15,018
on him and it transformed him into like this
bald, strong, not as strong as the Hulk, but

285
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:18,139
he was like about as strong as Spider-Man. It
was nice that they had this precedent here

286
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:22,380
for the character. It wasn't just some random
thing that they introduced. Yeah, that's cool.

287
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:27,122
That's really cool. Yeah. In this timeline,
Justin Hammer escapes from prison prior to

288
00:25:27,142 --> 00:25:31,843
the events of Avengers Age of Ultron. He and
his henchmen seize the Avengers Tower during

289
00:25:31,903 --> 00:25:37,125
a time that the Jarvis AI is down for maintenance,
where Happy Hogan is overseeing security at

290
00:25:37,165 --> 00:25:41,907
the building's annual Christmas Eve party. Stumbling
on the villain's plan to steal a sample of

291
00:25:41,967 --> 00:25:46,150
Hulk's blood, Happy works his way through the
building's vents to get to the lab and retrieve

292
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:51,053
the sample first. He accidentally injects himself
with the sample, which causes him to begin

293
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:55,296
transforming into a Hulk-like monster known
as the Freak. He tries to get ahold of the

294
00:25:55,336 --> 00:26:00,160
Avengers members, but Natasha is fighting Hydra
at the Nutcracker Ballet, Tony is playing Santa

295
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:04,703
Claus for kids at a Stark charity event along
with Steve who is an elf, and Bruce and Clint

296
00:26:04,743 --> 00:26:09,978
are shopping for a hard-to-get Iron Man action
figure for Clint's kids. Happy calls his intern

297
00:26:10,038 --> 00:26:14,881
Darcy, asking her to reboot Jarvis and regain
control of the building. But she is captured

298
00:26:15,061 --> 00:26:19,723
and Justin Hammer dons the Hulkbuster armor
to fight Happy, who has fully transformed into

299
00:26:19,743 --> 00:26:24,746
the Freak. Though Happy defeats Justin Hammer,
the Avengers return and attack him, believing

300
00:26:24,766 --> 00:26:30,689
he is a villain. Darcy convinces them that the
Freak is Happy and everyone celebrates. Thor

301
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:34,972
arrives late. I thought this was a fun and entertaining
episode, exactly what it was supposed to be

302
00:26:35,072 --> 00:26:39,195
as an homage to the Die Hard movie. I thought
it was great that they dropped it on Christmas

303
00:26:39,215 --> 00:26:44,479
Day. I did have a small issue with the dialogue,
specifically Justin Hammer's dialogue was a

304
00:26:44,539 --> 00:26:49,562
little bit punny and kind of overwritten and
not all the jokes landed, but I thought it

305
00:26:49,582 --> 00:26:55,126
was a great concept where Justin Hammer filled
in as the Hans Gruber character. Yeah, I thought

306
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:59,749
that was perfectly well done. I did not mind
the puns. I thought it was totally appropriate.

307
00:27:00,266 --> 00:27:05,548
I was laughing a lot during this episode. I
like the part where he falls out of Avengers

308
00:27:05,588 --> 00:27:09,790
Tower like Hans Gruber fell out of Nakatomi
Plaza. They did it in slow motion and everything.

309
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:16,313
So many great little call outs to the Die Hard
movie. Darcy is usually hit or miss for me,

310
00:27:16,393 --> 00:27:21,495
but I actually really liked her in this episode.
I thought she was funny. She was like, Happy,

311
00:27:21,675 --> 00:27:25,957
are you making me your Reginald Val Johnson?
And Happy is like, wait, that's what you remember

312
00:27:26,017 --> 00:27:31,472
from the movie? Yeah, John Favreau is a great
voice actor. I have to say he actually does

313
00:27:31,532 --> 00:27:36,776
really well in this episode and in the 1602
episode. He has a lot of range as a voice actor.

314
00:27:37,117 --> 00:27:42,001
Definitely. Yeah, I would agree. In all, I give
this episode four stars as well. So far, all

315
00:27:42,021 --> 00:27:46,724
the episodes have gotten four stars for me.
Yeah, I'll go four stars as well. I liked it.

316
00:27:46,804 --> 00:27:51,348
I didn't like it as much as the last episode,
though. Episode four is called What If Iron

317
00:27:51,368 --> 00:27:56,380
Man crashed into the Grandmaster? It has Jeff
Goldblum as the Grandmaster, Tessa Thompson

318
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:02,124
as Valkyrie, Taika Waititi as Korg, and Josh
Brolin as Thanos. In this timeline, Iron Man

319
00:28:02,184 --> 00:28:06,348
didn't make it back through the wormhole after
sending the nuclear missile into the Chitauri

320
00:28:06,368 --> 00:28:11,492
ship and ended up on the planet of Sakaar. The
Grandmaster invites him to celebrate his birthday

321
00:28:11,612 --> 00:28:16,696
and Tony obliges under threat of being melted.
He witnesses the Sakaar Grand Prix, a death

322
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:21,199
race in a gladiatorial arena. where Valkyrie
impresses Tony with her driving, despite the

323
00:28:21,239 --> 00:28:26,482
fact he's put off by the barbarism on display.
Tony tries to rescue Korg, but Gamora enters

324
00:28:26,502 --> 00:28:31,725
the scene, attempting to kill Stark for defeating
Thanos' army. Gamora and Tony are hit with

325
00:28:31,785 --> 00:28:37,089
obedience discs and imprisoned, though Stark
escapes by overloading his disc using his arc

326
00:28:37,129 --> 00:28:42,312
reactor. He recruits both Korg and Valkyrie
to help him overthrow the Grandmaster's tyrannical

327
00:28:42,352 --> 00:28:49,588
rule over Gamora is also forced to participate
in the race, whom Tony tries to reason with

328
00:28:49,668 --> 00:28:54,191
and convince her to step out of her father's
shadow. Despite the Grandmaster cheating at

329
00:28:54,271 --> 00:28:59,474
every turn, Tony wins the race and Valkyrie
becomes the new ruler of Sakaar after the Grandmaster

330
00:28:59,534 --> 00:29:04,417
accidentally gets melted with his own weapon.
On Tony's way out of Sakaar, Gamora confronts

331
00:29:04,437 --> 00:29:09,740
him and the two execute a plan to kill Thanos
using Grandmaster's Melt Stick. I feel like

332
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:14,811
this was an episode that was really good on
paper. And, you know, just hearing you describe

333
00:29:14,891 --> 00:29:20,937
it, it sounds like a fantastic episode. I just
think the voice actor for Tony Stark was fricking

334
00:29:21,077 --> 00:29:27,503
terrible. I really liked it. No, I think he
delivers his lines very differently from how

335
00:29:27,603 --> 00:29:32,127
Robert Downey Jr. would actually deliver. I
don't know. The actor's name is Mike Wingert.

336
00:29:32,327 --> 00:29:37,111
And I actually liked a lot of his delivery here,
especially when it came to Tony Stark's approached

337
00:29:37,251 --> 00:29:42,407
the absurdity of the planet Sakaar. His reactions
to everything kind of reminded me of Robert

338
00:29:42,427 --> 00:29:47,470
Downey Jr's reaction to the Guardians of the
Galaxy in the Infinity War movie, where he's

339
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:52,153
just at his tipping point all the time with
this weird cast of characters. I thought it

340
00:29:52,173 --> 00:29:57,176
was a lot of fun. Maybe it was just the combination
of the face animation and the voiceover. I

341
00:29:57,216 --> 00:30:02,319
just knew the whole time that it was not Robert
Downey Jr. And it just took me out of the whole

342
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:08,775
thing. I also never liked Jeff Goldblum as the
Grandmaster. What? Yes, it's you're on the

343
00:30:08,815 --> 00:30:14,039
wrong side of history on that one. I got irritating
shit. I don't like it. It's just so unbelievably

344
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:19,204
played for laughs. And I personally don't find
Jeff Goldblum that funny. I know I'm on the

345
00:30:19,224 --> 00:30:23,607
wrong side of history there. I don't really
give a fuck because that's irritating to shit.

346
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:28,752
He's like the personification of debauchery
and hedonism. I thought it was fantastic. I

347
00:30:28,872 --> 00:30:34,256
loved the Mad Max for your road premise. The
action was so chaotic at times. It was sometimes

348
00:30:34,276 --> 00:30:38,512
hard to follow because you don't have that.
depth of field in animation like you do in

349
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:43,296
live action. Right. But the cars were incredible.
I liked that one car that would swallow up

350
00:30:43,376 --> 00:30:47,139
cars ahead of it in the jet turbine and then
grind them up and spit them out as bullets

351
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:52,524
behind it. I was like, I need that in Mario
Kart. That'd be like the perfect car. My favorite

352
00:30:52,544 --> 00:30:59,049
car honestly was Iron Man's suit that he made
for this episode. Holy cow. It made me honestly

353
00:30:59,129 --> 00:31:03,693
really miss Iron Man as a character just because
of all the really cool stuff you could make

354
00:31:03,753 --> 00:31:09,471
and do. Yeah, when his chariot car blew up and
he ejected his suit, which like reformed into

355
00:31:09,491 --> 00:31:13,872
this race car kind of thing, that was a bad
ass moment. Really cool. Honestly, that may

356
00:31:13,912 --> 00:31:18,994
be like one of the biggest highlights of the
entire series. If only it was live action.

357
00:31:19,054 --> 00:31:23,935
Holy shit. This would have been a cool episode
in live action. Yeah, I really like the ending

358
00:31:23,995 --> 00:31:27,916
where Gamora melts Thanos. I thought that was
a powerful ending. This is the same Gamora

359
00:31:27,956 --> 00:31:31,657
that went on to become one of the guardians
of the multiverse from season one. Although

360
00:31:31,677 --> 00:31:36,187
we never see Thanos melted. We see him partially
melting. You know, he's going to melt. He's

361
00:31:36,207 --> 00:31:40,390
going to melt. That's what the melt stick does.
It melts. True. I did not think that Cynthia

362
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:45,514
McWilliams, who was the actress who played Gamora
in this episode, sounded anything like Zoe

363
00:31:45,534 --> 00:31:50,017
Saldana, though. No, same. Absolutely. Come
on, Zoe, where are you making billion dollar

364
00:31:50,037 --> 00:31:56,581
films, I guess? In all, I give this episode
four stars again. I think the series has been

365
00:31:56,761 --> 00:32:01,044
nothing but consistent so far. I give it three
and a half just because it's too much Jeff

366
00:32:01,084 --> 00:32:07,369
Goldblum for me. Did you see the after credit
scene on that one? Yes, unfortunately. Wasting

367
00:32:07,409 --> 00:32:09,075
my time. Sponge me up.

368
00:32:15,854 --> 00:32:20,838
Episode 5 was called What If Captain Carter
Fought the Hydra Stomper. It had Hayley Atwell

369
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:26,604
as Captain Carter, Lake Bell as Black Widow,
Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Rachel Weiss

370
00:32:26,824 --> 00:32:32,450
as Melina Vostokoff, and Sebastian Stan as Bucky
Barnes. In this timeline, Peggy Carter received

371
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:37,455
the Super Soldier Serum after Steve Rogers was
shot at Project Rebirth. She became Captain

372
00:32:37,475 --> 00:32:43,419
Carter in World War II as Rogers donned a precursor
Iron Man suit called the Hydra Stopper developed

373
00:32:43,479 --> 00:32:48,760
by Howard Stark and powered by the Tesseract.
Together, they helped stop a plot by the Red

374
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:54,282
Skull from using the Tesseract to bring an extra-dimensional
entity to Earth. Captain Carter's actions sent

375
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:58,964
her nearly seventy years into the future where
she became an Avenger. On one mission for S.H.I.E.L.D.,

376
00:32:59,444 --> 00:33:03,765
she and Black Widow stumbled upon Steve Rogers
and the Hydra Stopper armor who attacks them

377
00:33:03,945 --> 00:33:08,180
and then escapes. Peggy learns that Steve was
captured by the Russian Red Room during the

378
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,945
Cold War and brainwashed into serving as their
assassin, with the armor keeping him in stasis

379
00:33:13,065 --> 00:33:17,450
until he was needed. The Hydra Stomper attacks
the S.H.I.E.L.D. Treskeleon headquarters in

380
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:22,615
an attempt to kill Bucky Barnes, who had become
Secretary of State. Peggy manages to subdue

381
00:33:22,655 --> 00:33:26,899
him, and she and Black Widow take Steve to a
secret safe house in Scotland where they reboot

382
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:32,119
the Hydra Stomper and decide to dismantle the
Red Room. Steve takes them to an old KGB base

383
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:36,744
built like an old American suburb where they're
attacked and confronted by Melina Vostokoff,

384
00:33:36,844 --> 00:33:41,468
the new Red Room leader and the one in charge
of Steve's brainwashing. During the battle,

385
00:33:41,648 --> 00:33:46,413
Peggy appeals to Steve who overcomes the mind
control to sacrifice himself to destroy the

386
00:33:46,453 --> 00:33:51,457
Red Room headquarters. Believing that Steve
is alive, Peggy sets out to find him but falls

387
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:55,721
through a portal that takes her to a renaissance
themed universe that is looking for her help.

388
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:59,593
This was another one of my favorite episodes.
I really liked it because, as you mentioned,

389
00:33:59,753 --> 00:34:05,158
it's essentially the Winter Soldier storyline,
but if Peggy became Captain America. Yeah,

390
00:34:05,658 --> 00:34:10,122
with, again, those elements from the Black Widow
movie, which I thought plot wise played in

391
00:34:10,322 --> 00:34:14,826
brilliantly with the story of the Winter Soldier.
Great episode. I was excited to see Rachel

392
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:19,170
Weisz voice the role. She's a phenomenal actress.
And for her to come back for animation for

393
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:23,806
this just shows, you know, how much they, I
guess, like Marvel as a whole. Right. I think

394
00:34:23,866 --> 00:34:27,988
like Bell does a pretty good job of voicing
Scarlett Johansson. I mean, at some points

395
00:34:28,048 --> 00:34:32,771
I would hear just Poison Ivy speaking, but I
would say a lot of the times she passed for

396
00:34:32,831 --> 00:34:36,913
Scar Jo. I would agree. Watching the beginning
of this episode, I was trying to figure out

397
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:42,476
why Captain Carter's existence in the past led
to Bruce Banner not becoming the Hulk and being

398
00:34:42,516 --> 00:34:46,658
part of the original Avengers, though it was
cool to see the Wasp as one of the original

399
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:50,681
Avengers. Yeah, that was cool. I mean, not as
cool as the 80s team from episode two, but

400
00:34:50,961 --> 00:34:56,392
still pretty cool. Yeah. I want to bring up
the huge power levels problem that this show

401
00:34:56,412 --> 00:35:01,295
seems to have. I brought it up in a previous
episode where we see how Thor and Black Panther

402
00:35:01,436 --> 00:35:05,979
struggle similarly in a fight against Ego's
avatars. And that problem continues in this

403
00:35:06,019 --> 00:35:11,422
episode. Like how can Captain Carter take on
the Hydra Stomper, which is basically an Iron

404
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:16,926
Man suit, as well as tank dozens of widow's
bites that are shot at her before they even

405
00:35:16,946 --> 00:35:22,954
seem to affect her. She also had a car slammed
into her that then exploded. and she was fine

406
00:35:22,994 --> 00:35:28,420
afterward. It was just very strange. Not going
to lie, they make Captain Carter way too OP

407
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,625
in the series. I understand that she's sort
of like the protagonist of maybe the whole

408
00:35:32,725 --> 00:35:37,550
what of series, but it's like, OK, yeah, we'll
talk about that again later on in the last

409
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:42,596
episode. But I rate episode five three and a
half stars. Wait, what? Yeah, I didn't think

410
00:35:42,636 --> 00:35:47,191
it quite held up as much as the other ones.
Mainly because the dialogue and line delivery

411
00:35:47,251 --> 00:35:51,253
between Hayley Atwell and Lake Bell started
getting grading to me. I don't think Hayley

412
00:35:51,273 --> 00:35:56,276
Atwell is a solid voice actress. She kind of
reads the lines like she's reading lines, you

413
00:35:56,296 --> 00:36:00,799
know? That's fair. That's fair. I did like the
episode though. I would give it four stars.

414
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:05,822
Let's go to move on to episode six, which is
called What If Kehori Reshaped the World. In

415
00:36:05,882 --> 00:36:11,985
it, we have Devory Jacobs playing the character
of Kehori. In this timeline, the fire demon

416
00:36:12,105 --> 00:36:17,939
Surtur... destroyed Asgard during Ragnarok centuries
earlier, resulting in the Tesseract hurtling

417
00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:23,440
to pre-colonial eastern America on Earth. Falling
into a lake, the Tesseract created a portal

418
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:28,482
to an alternate dimension, causing the local
Native American tribes to name the area Forbidden

419
00:36:28,542 --> 00:36:34,283
Lake. In the late 15th century, a young Mohawk
woman named K'Hori and her little brother Wata

420
00:36:34,403 --> 00:36:38,805
encounter a group of conquistadors ransacking
their village in search of the Fountain of

421
00:36:38,865 --> 00:36:44,346
Youth. Fleeing, the siblings stumble upon the
Forbidden Lake. Kahori is shot and falls into

422
00:36:44,406 --> 00:36:49,069
it, and the portal within, which transports
her to what the natives refer to as Skyworld.

423
00:36:49,549 --> 00:36:54,612
There she learns to control the vast telekinetic
powers granted to her by the energy of the

424
00:36:54,652 --> 00:37:00,475
tesseract, including telekinesis, enhanced speed,
concussive blasts, energy shielding, and portal

425
00:37:00,495 --> 00:37:05,618
creation. Though the inhabitants are content
to stay within Skyworld, Kahori's knowledge

426
00:37:05,698 --> 00:37:10,080
of the Conquistadors motivates her to use her
abilities to try and leave the dimension in

427
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:14,822
order to save her brother and her tribe. She
returns home and attacks a fleet of ships that

428
00:37:14,842 --> 00:37:19,684
had chained up her tribe, though they bombard
her with cannon fire. The inhabitants of Skyworld

429
00:37:19,724 --> 00:37:24,485
return just in time to help, and they free her
people, being referred to as Thunder Beings

430
00:37:24,585 --> 00:37:29,947
by Wata. Empowered by their victory, they confront
Queen Isabella of Spain, though it is cut short

431
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:34,688
by Doctor Strange Supreme, who recruits Kihori
for a mission. I thought this was an amazing

432
00:37:34,748 --> 00:37:38,669
original story. When I first heard that they
were going to introduce a new character within

433
00:37:38,769 --> 00:37:44,832
one of the I wasn't thrilled because I thought
that the concept of what if should be restrained

434
00:37:44,912 --> 00:37:49,775
to explorations of existing stories, but I thought
this was a beautiful story. The setting of

435
00:37:49,815 --> 00:37:54,098
Skyworld I thought was really cool. It was like
Avatar. It kind of reminded me of that. I love

436
00:37:54,178 --> 00:37:58,321
how they chose to do the entire episode in the
Mohawk language and Spanish. That was an awesome

437
00:37:58,361 --> 00:38:04,885
choice. I saw on the internet a few people call
K'Hori a Mary Sue because she was just immediately

438
00:38:04,945 --> 00:38:09,983
so adept at using her powers. But I think the
story provided the context and why she would

439
00:38:10,003 --> 00:38:15,284
be because she was the only one out of the natives
in Skyworld that knew of the conquistadors.

440
00:38:15,444 --> 00:38:19,086
And she knew that she had to return in order
to save her people, whereas everyone else was

441
00:38:19,106 --> 00:38:23,067
kind of complacent. In all, I loved the world
building that they had here, the character

442
00:38:23,107 --> 00:38:27,609
building. I think Kihori is a fantastic new
addition to the Marvel Universe. I'm really

443
00:38:27,649 --> 00:38:31,870
interested in seeing where they take her from
here. I hope that she makes an appearance in

444
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:36,133
the comic books. I hope they don't just relegate
her to this television show because I think

445
00:38:36,293 --> 00:38:39,896
her character is worth further exploration.
Do you think they would ever bring her about

446
00:38:39,956 --> 00:38:43,698
in live action? That would be awesome. And I
think the actress who does the voice for her

447
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:48,162
could play her in live action. I think that'd
be great. In all, this is probably one of my

448
00:38:48,182 --> 00:38:52,004
favorite episodes of the season, so I give it
four and a half stars. Yeah, it was good. It

449
00:38:52,024 --> 00:38:55,907
was solid. Honestly, no real gripes with it.
I'll give it four and a half stars. I thought

450
00:38:55,947 --> 00:39:01,474
Kohari as a superhero was really cool. Her power
set is just incredible. Yeah for sure. Moving

451
00:39:01,514 --> 00:39:07,118
on to episode 7, that is called What If Hela
Found the Ten Rings. It has Cate Blanchett

452
00:39:07,198 --> 00:39:12,642
playing Hela and Idris Elba playing Heimdall.
Fucking Cate Blanchett doing voice over, that

453
00:39:12,662 --> 00:39:17,465
was awesome. She did such a good job. Really
good job. She really owns that character, I

454
00:39:17,485 --> 00:39:22,489
think. Lot of personality there. For sure. In
this timeline, instead of imprisoning his daughter

455
00:39:22,529 --> 00:39:27,853
Hela in the realm of Hell, Odin banishes her
to Earth to learn respect for life, enchanting

456
00:39:27,893 --> 00:39:33,439
her crown to be worn on her. Only by those with
mercy, Odin sends Hella to medieval China where

457
00:39:33,459 --> 00:39:38,340
the Mandarin finds her. He takes a liking to
her and tries to recruit her into his army,

458
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:44,742
though she attempts to steal his rings. Unsuccessful,
Hella flees his compound and encounters a hand-done

459
00:39:44,762 --> 00:39:50,564
creature that guides her to the realm of Ta
Lo. There, a woman named Yi reveals to Hella

460
00:39:50,604 --> 00:39:55,785
her true desire of freedom from control, and
teaches her the mystical martial arts, bringing

461
00:39:55,825 --> 00:40:00,866
Hella peace. Odin learns from Heimdall that
he can no longer see Hela and that the Mandarin

462
00:40:00,907 --> 00:40:05,568
is in possession of a god-destroying power.
Convinced his daughter is in danger, Odin leads

463
00:40:05,608 --> 00:40:10,909
an army of Asgardians to Earth and goes to battle
with the Mandarin's forces. Hela arrives to

464
00:40:10,949 --> 00:40:17,131
assist and fights her father, eventually subduing
him and granting him mercy. At that point she

465
00:40:17,151 --> 00:40:22,552
becomes worthy of her crown again and Odin grants
her his throne, where she strives to free the

466
00:40:22,592 --> 00:40:28,551
nine realms from Asgard's empire and becomes
a hero across the cosmos. later alongside the

467
00:40:28,591 --> 00:40:34,115
Mandarin, the two defeat Thanos, the Mad Titan.
I think this is another amazing story, again

468
00:40:34,436 --> 00:40:38,439
melding the first Thor film with the Legend
of the Ten Rings movie. Yeah it was a good

469
00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:43,143
episode, honestly I was just really excited
to see the Ten Rings come back again. I think

470
00:40:43,163 --> 00:40:47,287
we were way past due for a Shang-Chi sequel,
so it was nice to get a little taste of that

471
00:40:47,347 --> 00:40:53,692
again here. Yeah, it was funny that Wenwu took
a liking to Hela. I liked how Hela was humbled

472
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:57,779
by her mortal trappings. You know, she came
in with such confidence and she was a good

473
00:40:57,799 --> 00:41:02,081
fighter and everything. But you just saw how
devastated she was when she couldn't lift up

474
00:41:02,101 --> 00:41:07,263
her crown. And I thought it was a believable
journey going from there to trying to steal

475
00:41:07,283 --> 00:41:12,265
the rings, to going to Talo and then really
being humbled again there and coming to be

476
00:41:12,405 --> 00:41:17,147
at peace with herself. I thought it was really
cool to see Odin in battle as well. It's something

477
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:22,450
we've never really seen before in the MCU. He's
a badass. He is such a badass. with Gungnir,

478
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:26,834
like especially going up against the Ten Rings,
where Odin was like twirling his spear, Kung

479
00:41:26,854 --> 00:41:31,017
Fu style, to block the rings that are flying
at him. Everything about that battle was fantastic.

480
00:41:31,558 --> 00:41:37,322
I honestly don't think that Hela and Wenwu would
ever defeat Odin in battle, so that was kind

481
00:41:37,342 --> 00:41:42,367
of like a power levels thing here, because Odin
is pretty much all powerful. But, I think for

482
00:41:42,407 --> 00:41:47,891
the purposes of the story that they were telling,
where Hela really grew as a character due to

483
00:41:47,931 --> 00:41:51,966
her experience on Earth, I thought it all worked
well. Yeah, I thought the ending was kind of

484
00:41:51,986 --> 00:41:57,749
bullshit too, but overall a pretty good episode.
I liked when you saw Hela and the Asgardian

485
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:02,852
army side by side with the Mandarin's forces
and they were charging into battle against

486
00:42:02,892 --> 00:42:09,115
Thanos together. And when Wu was like running
on air on top of his rings, using them as like

487
00:42:09,275 --> 00:42:14,138
stepping stones. That was badass. I just love
how the ten rings are depicted always. I want

488
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:19,681
the ten rings. I give this episode four stars
and all. I thought it was another solid great

489
00:42:19,761 --> 00:42:25,871
exploration. Yeah, I'll go four stars as well.
Episode 8 was called What If the Avengers Assembled

490
00:42:25,891 --> 00:42:32,153
in 1602. It had Hayley Atwell as Captain Carter,
Samuel Jackson as Sir Nicholas Fury, Elizabeth

491
00:42:32,253 --> 00:42:37,654
Olsen as Wanda Merlin, Chris Hemsworth as King
Thor, Mark Ruffalo as the Monster in the Iron

492
00:42:37,674 --> 00:42:43,196
Mask, Jon Favreau as Sir Harold Hogan, Paul
Rudd as Scott Lang, and Sebastian Stan as Bucky

493
00:42:43,216 --> 00:42:48,698
Barnes. In this timeline, Marvel heroes lived
during the time of the late Renaissance. In

494
00:42:48,718 --> 00:42:53,119
the year 1602, Captain Carter is summoned to
save the dimension from an incursion that is

495
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:58,261
slowly destroying reality due to the presence
of a time displaced individual. However, after

496
00:42:58,321 --> 00:43:03,522
failing to stop the tears in the universe, King
Thor has Peggy branded an outlaw, believing

497
00:43:03,602 --> 00:43:08,644
her to be the cause. She turns to Tony Stark
to find the individual, but he tells her they

498
00:43:08,664 --> 00:43:13,045
need the Time Stone and King Thor's scepter
to power the device that will locate them.

499
00:43:13,494 --> 00:43:17,975
To steal the scepter, Peggy turns to a group
of thieves consisting of Steve Rogers, Bucky

500
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:23,336
Barnes, and Scott Lang. However, their rendezvous
is ambushed by the Yellow Jackets and the Destroyer,

501
00:43:23,516 --> 00:43:29,238
led by Sir Harold Hogan. Peggy is imprisoned,
but she escapes and frees Bruce Banner. Rejoining

502
00:43:29,258 --> 00:43:33,759
with Steve Rogers' band of thieves and Tony
Stark, Peggy and the group storm King Thor's

503
00:43:33,799 --> 00:43:39,320
court to get the Time Stone. With Wanda Merlin's
help, the group acquires the gem to Power Stark's

504
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:45,458
device, which identifies Steve Rogers as the
Man Out of Time. a result of Steve striking

505
00:43:45,478 --> 00:43:50,880
the Time Stone in his battle with Thanos during
the events of Infinity War. Peggy uses Stark's

506
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:55,822
device to send Steve back to his home timeline,
and after the battle, she's approached by Doctor

507
00:43:55,842 --> 00:44:02,164
Strange Supreme. I thought this episode sucked.
I thought it was a lame excuse to have another

508
00:44:02,184 --> 00:44:06,565
episode with Captain Carter. Do not think she
belonged in this universe or was even needed.

509
00:44:07,314 --> 00:44:12,455
I thought there was a lot of missed opportunities,
like low-hanging fruit when it came to making

510
00:44:12,495 --> 00:44:17,957
Hawkeye Robin Hood and Tony Stark the man in
the Iron Mask. Yes, I totally agree with that.

511
00:44:17,997 --> 00:44:22,599
Just too much that I did not like. The main
issue with this episode is that it was a fight

512
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:27,221
that could have been a conversation, right?
For some reason, King Thor was the antagonist

513
00:44:27,361 --> 00:44:32,964
just due to his stubbornness. But ultimately
what he was wanting was to stop this incursion

514
00:44:32,984 --> 00:44:37,386
from happening. And if they had basically, I
think just had a conversation and were like,

515
00:44:37,406 --> 00:44:41,849
dude, we just need to borrow the scepter. We'll
find out who this guy is using this device.

516
00:44:42,029 --> 00:44:47,172
What was the point of all the fighting? It just
kind of made Thor seem like this overly stubborn

517
00:44:47,332 --> 00:44:52,075
character and really unlikeable, which, you
know, you don't want to dislike Thor. Yeah,

518
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:57,982
I know. Right. I mean, like Thor, Love and Thunder
already did enough of that. I do. Question

519
00:44:58,022 --> 00:45:05,328
though, if the Steve Rogers that was in this
1602 episode was the one from the Infinity

520
00:45:05,388 --> 00:45:10,572
War battle in main MCU, because if so, does
that mean that the Chris Evans version of Steve

521
00:45:10,612 --> 00:45:15,816
Rogers that we know has these memories of being
in the past? I think it's really unclear as

522
00:45:15,856 --> 00:45:21,020
to what memories Steve Rogers had. Like when
he was Rogershood, did he still retain his

523
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:26,480
memories from battling Thanos? I think he did.
And if so, why didn't he just come out as the

524
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,763
individual who was causing these terrors in
space time? It's possible that he didn't know,

525
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:35,407
but you think that he would have been informed
of that during the debrief as to why they needed

526
00:45:35,427 --> 00:45:38,970
the time stone and all that stuff. You know,
a lot of questions with this episode. I mean,

527
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:45,255
he knew that he had hit the time stone. He explained
that. So I think it's clear that he had memories

528
00:45:45,315 --> 00:45:48,978
of it. I think the implication was that being
flagged by the time stone kind of awakened

529
00:45:49,018 --> 00:45:54,931
those memories. I don't know. I don't know.
And honestly, I don't care. Because this episode

530
00:45:55,011 --> 00:45:59,695
sucked. I think the biggest crime that this
episode committed was that it was nothing like

531
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:03,679
the 1602 comic book, which would have been a
lot of fun. Yeah, I'm sure Neil Gaiman is like,

532
00:46:03,699 --> 00:46:09,645
what the fuck, guys? Really? I rate this episode
three stars out of five. I'll give this one

533
00:46:09,825 --> 00:46:14,730
three stars as well, but even then I think that's
a little bit generous. In the final episode,

534
00:46:14,950 --> 00:46:20,286
episode nine was called, What If Strange Supreme
Intervened? It had Hayley Atwell returning

535
00:46:20,466 --> 00:46:26,228
as Captain Carter, Benedict Cumberbatch as Dr.
Strange Supreme, and Devory Jacobs as K'Hori.

536
00:46:26,308 --> 00:46:31,149
In it, Strange Supreme reveals to Captain Carter
that he's been imprisoning universe killers

537
00:46:31,349 --> 00:46:35,910
as his atonement for the destruction of his
own reality. He asks her for help in catching

538
00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:40,452
an escaped variant, though this turns out to
be K'Hori, who warns Peggy about Strange's

539
00:46:40,512 --> 00:46:46,413
true intentions, to recreate his reality using
a dimensional forge fueled by beings of great

540
00:46:46,453 --> 00:46:51,596
power. As Strange attempts to kill K'Hori, Captain
Carter frees his captives and they encounter

541
00:46:51,656 --> 00:46:56,838
Killmonger from the first season wearing Infinity
Ultron's armor. K'Hori teleports him out of

542
00:46:56,858 --> 00:47:02,181
the suit, which Peggy then dons to wield the
Infinity Stones. After an extended battle,

543
00:47:02,301 --> 00:47:07,644
Captain Carter and K'Hori acquire Hela's Crown,
Mjolnir, the Ten Rings, and what appears to

544
00:47:07,684 --> 00:47:13,964
be the sword Excelsior from a variant of Hulkling.
Strange is overtaken by the demonic personification

545
00:47:14,004 --> 00:47:19,148
of his guilt, who Carter and Kihori knock into
the forge, killing Strange by creating a new

546
00:47:19,208 --> 00:47:24,632
universe where Strange's love, Christine Palmer,
lives. The Watcher takes Peggy on a journey

547
00:47:24,692 --> 00:47:30,197
to see the multiverse, which manifests as the
Yggdrasil tree from the end of Loki Season

548
00:47:30,237 --> 00:47:37,199
2. Uh... But majority of the runtime was taken
up by this insanely epic fight between Strange

549
00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:42,721
Supreme and Captain Carter and Kahori. As enjoyable
as that fight was, I kept being annoyed by

550
00:47:42,821 --> 00:47:48,582
the power levels issue because it was established
in season one that Doctor Strange Supreme was

551
00:47:48,642 --> 00:47:54,524
the most powerful being in existence in that
reality. He basically overcame everybody and

552
00:47:54,544 --> 00:47:59,625
destroyed the universe in his quest to acquire
enough power to resurrect Christine Palmer,

553
00:47:59,725 --> 00:48:04,566
who died in his reality. So you have the most
powerful being in existence of one universe

554
00:48:04,606 --> 00:48:10,208
going up against Kahori who has telekinesis.
And she was basically holding her own and I

555
00:48:10,228 --> 00:48:15,130
thought that was a little bit strange. More
annoying than that, you have Captain Carter

556
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:20,171
wearing the Infinity Armor that Ultron created
from season one. The big thing there is that

557
00:48:20,331 --> 00:48:26,413
somehow both Killmonger and Captain Carter are
able to wield the energies of the stones and

558
00:48:26,433 --> 00:48:31,576
the subsequent radiation, which we know is powerful
enough. to render the Hulk out of action and

559
00:48:31,656 --> 00:48:36,920
kill Tony Stark. And yet these guys were wielding
the stones energies effortlessly. Not only

560
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:42,145
that, I don't get why the stones worked outside
of the universe that they originated to begin

561
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:47,069
with. Right, that's a whole thing too. In the
comic books, the stones don't work outside

562
00:48:47,089 --> 00:48:51,693
of their native dimension. I'm not sure if that's
the case within the MCU. Well, Loki said it

563
00:48:51,733 --> 00:48:56,577
was. We learned that in Loki season one. They
didn't work in the TVA because the TVA is outside

564
00:48:56,617 --> 00:49:01,239
of time and space. but we don't know if the
same rule applies to, you know, carrying stones

565
00:49:01,319 --> 00:49:05,821
across dimensions. We just know that they don't
work in the TVA. Okay. Now, some people might

566
00:49:05,861 --> 00:49:11,384
say that the reason that Peggy Carter was able
to wield the Infinity Armor was because the

567
00:49:11,444 --> 00:49:17,706
armor granted the wearer enough protection against
the stones' energies, to which I reply, there

568
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:23,629
is a shot in this episode where Peggy loses
the stones from the armor and Kihori telekinetically

569
00:49:23,729 --> 00:49:29,305
throws them back at Peggy. Peggy catches all
the stones in her hand, which she then uses

570
00:49:29,365 --> 00:49:34,649
to deliver an insanely epic punch against the
demon creature that is Strange Supreme. So

571
00:49:34,669 --> 00:49:39,653
she has the stones in her hand, which should
have just torn her apart. Right, like the Power

572
00:49:39,693 --> 00:49:43,837
Stone alone should have done that as we saw
in Guardians of the Galaxy, unless she's like

573
00:49:43,957 --> 00:49:48,561
half celestial like Peter Quill was. There's
no way she's even close to being half celestial,

574
00:49:48,961 --> 00:49:55,842
right? It's a problem. I have questions. Last
point about the stones. I made this point in

575
00:49:55,882 --> 00:50:00,164
our review for season one is that I feel like
these people aren't wielding the stones right.

576
00:50:00,444 --> 00:50:06,047
Like literally you just have to snap things
away. Like wire Infinity Ultron and Captain

577
00:50:06,087 --> 00:50:10,489
Carter using the stones with a warrior's mentality.
Like you don't have to do all that. Once you

578
00:50:10,509 --> 00:50:14,571
have all the stones, you're literally omnipotent
and you can do anything and you don't have

579
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:18,973
to like shoot laser beams. Like why would you
do that? Just blink Doctor Strange away. That's

580
00:50:18,993 --> 00:50:23,815
all you have to do. It's weird. It's true. Yeah,
I mean we saw Killmonger snap away Thanos with

581
00:50:23,875 --> 00:50:29,399
his Infinity Gauntlet. Why not just do it to
Doctor Strange Supreme? Yeah, it was really

582
00:50:29,439 --> 00:50:34,583
cool to see all the like bonus characters in
this episode from previous seasons and from,

583
00:50:34,723 --> 00:50:39,606
you know, the MCU and stuff. We saw Thanos,
we saw Hela, we saw Zombie Wanda. That was

584
00:50:39,646 --> 00:50:45,550
all really cool. I'm really curious why we didn't
see benevolent Hela like. If there were any

585
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:50,213
characters that could like change the universe
completely, you'd think that version of Hela

586
00:50:50,333 --> 00:50:55,977
would do more to change things than Kehori.
You're not wrong. Honestly, I'm not sure why

587
00:50:56,037 --> 00:51:00,600
Dr. Strange Supreme even needed Captain Carter
to capture Kehori for him. Like this whole

588
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:06,524
thing was fucking pointless. That's entirely
true. That is a great question. Um, I guess

589
00:51:06,544 --> 00:51:10,822
because Dr. Strange wanted to capture both of
them ultimately. But you're right, with how

590
00:51:10,882 --> 00:51:15,805
powerful as Strange Supreme is, he should have
had no problem getting Kahori back into his

591
00:51:15,825 --> 00:51:20,347
collection. And also it's not like if he needed
to capture both of them, he didn't need one

592
00:51:20,387 --> 00:51:25,750
to do the other. He's fucking Doctor Strange
Supreme. Right. I did think that the ending

593
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:31,453
for this episode though, was kind of a poetic
for Strange Supreme's story. Wherein he ultimately

594
00:51:31,493 --> 00:51:37,196
got exactly what he always wanted, which was
Christine Palmer reborn in a new universe,

595
00:51:37,317 --> 00:51:41,179
but one that he would never be born into. at
the end of the day. It was ironic. Yeah, it

596
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:45,001
was definitely poetic justice, like you said.
I did think it was cool that they managed to

597
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:50,284
squeeze Yggdrasil in at the very end of this
considering that just happened in Loki. Yeah,

598
00:51:50,424 --> 00:51:54,666
that was really cool to see. I know that they're
working on a Season 3 of What If, and they've

599
00:51:54,686 --> 00:51:59,529
already released a preview clip of that. I think
it's supposed to come maybe sometime this year.

600
00:52:00,490 --> 00:52:06,073
I hope that they kind of explore the whole Loki
serving as the multiversal loom thing within

601
00:52:06,113 --> 00:52:10,495
this upcoming What If season. They hinted at
it here. I think it's worth exploring and we'll

602
00:52:10,515 --> 00:52:14,618
see what happens. As we talked about this episode,
I actually originally gave this episode four

603
00:52:14,658 --> 00:52:18,861
stars, but I think I'm gonna knock it down a
half star because while I thought the action

604
00:52:18,901 --> 00:52:23,524
was awesome, there was just kind of a lot to
question, such as like why Dr. Strange needed

605
00:52:23,544 --> 00:52:26,626
Captain Carter. Although the ending was good,
I'm still gonna give this episode three and

606
00:52:26,646 --> 00:52:31,469
a half stars. I'm gonna give it three. I think
there were just too many plot holes that were.

607
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:37,411
critical to the story such as why Captain Carter
got involved and how Dr. Strange was punched

608
00:52:37,431 --> 00:52:42,673
in the face with infinity stones. Things like
that just break the episode for me. Yeah, but

609
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:47,974
those are all the episodes. When you average
out all my ratings, it comes to around four

610
00:52:48,034 --> 00:52:54,556
stars, which is one whole star higher than what
I rated season one. And I think that sounds

611
00:52:54,576 --> 00:52:59,477
about right. I really enjoyed season two. I
think it was the first time that audiences

612
00:52:59,517 --> 00:53:04,116
will see the premise of the show really come
to life. The stories were just better. You

613
00:53:04,136 --> 00:53:08,918
know, the sophomore season focused less on the
overarching narrative and more on telling worthwhile,

614
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:14,882
compelling stories that better serve the show's
concept. I rate the season 4 stars, a fresh

615
00:53:14,922 --> 00:53:20,265
rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Yeah, I would agree
with 4 stars. I do think it was better than

616
00:53:20,425 --> 00:53:26,468
season 1. I just love anthology series in general
and there were a lot of great episodes in this

617
00:53:26,528 --> 00:53:30,966
season. Definitely better than what we got in
season 1. So yeah, I'll agree with four stars.

618
00:53:31,446 --> 00:53:35,447
Do you know if all your star ratings averaged
out to about four stars? Yeah, I'm not doing

619
00:53:35,467 --> 00:53:39,588
the math. I'll just agree with you. Yeah. But
that does it for this review, guys. Let us

between the characters of Livewire, the Superman

630
00:54:32,968 --> 00:54:38,530

Yeah, these are two energy beings, essentially

631
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:43,892
one made of electricity and one made of sound.
I think it'll be a pretty fun duel episode.

632
00:54:43,912 --> 00:54:47,713
It'll be nice to get back to the duels, considering
it's been a few weeks since we've done one.
