00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,963
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,238 --> 00:00:29,160
Hi and welcome to Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:34,603
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:35,163 --> 00:00:41,127
I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm his twin brother
Johnny DC. And for Spooktober in this Halloween

5
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:45,929
season, guys, we have a special treat for you.
Just like last year, how we kind of surprised

6
00:00:45,949 --> 00:00:51,793
you guys with our DCs vs. Marvel zombies team
duel episode. We're doing it again. We're going

7
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:57,423
to do another spooky... team duel and find out
who would win in a fight between the creature

8
00:00:57,463 --> 00:01:03,985
commandos and the legion of monsters slash hellen
commandos. Yeah, of course, this is perfect

9
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:11,047
timing because DC has a creature commandos television
series that will be coming out later on this

10
00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:15,969
year. Yeah, I really can't wait to get into
this duel match, learn about both teams and

11
00:01:16,149 --> 00:01:19,870
of course find out who will win. That's all
coming later on this episode. Before that,

12
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,492
we're gonna break down the latest comic book
movie news to come out this past week. Of which

13
00:01:23,512 --> 00:01:27,854
there's quite a bit of news coming out of New
York Comic Con. Including our first look at

14
00:01:27,934 --> 00:01:33,956
Crypto in the DCU Superman film, the Creature
Commandos official trailer, the Batman Ninja

15
00:01:33,996 --> 00:01:40,759
vs Yakuza League new trailer, and the Watchmen
Chapter 2 official trailer. All DC news! Yeah,

16
00:01:40,779 --> 00:01:46,262
that's kinda lame, but Marvel got a lot of big
news coming out of D23 a few months ago. Marvel's

17
00:01:46,302 --> 00:01:52,228
going to win this matchup, so... What do you
think, huh? I'm not too concerned. Yeah. As

To the No Prize! A No Prize is an award Marvel

41
00:03:55,535 --> 00:04:00,778
used to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic
Duel No Prize, is a digital award that we post

42
00:04:00,818 --> 00:04:05,439
on Instagram for the person that we feel gave
the best answer to our question of the week.

43
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:12,562
Last week, we asked, What has been your favorite
live-action Marvel or DC television series

44
00:04:12,762 --> 00:04:18,845
so far and why? And that was coming off of the
hype of the Green Lantern casting for the upcoming

45
00:04:18,945 --> 00:04:24,604
Lantern series on HBO. We got a number of answers.
Let's break down this week's honorable mentions

46
00:04:24,624 --> 00:04:30,907
before revealing the no prize winner. Our first
honorable mention goes to Colby Henches who

47
00:04:30,947 --> 00:04:38,051
said, hey boys Colby Henches The best live-action
comic show from Marvel or DC was Marvel's Runaways

48
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:44,235
on Hulu. It was three seasons It was amazingly
cast and acted. They even brought the girl

49
00:04:44,255 --> 00:04:51,226
who played Nico back to play her again in the
Marvel Midnight Suns video game I don't regret

50
00:04:51,346 --> 00:04:57,230
a minute of that show. It was fun start to finish.
It should have had more seasons. So this one

51
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,593
gets the honorable mention right out of the
gate because I feel like it was controversial,

52
00:05:01,673 --> 00:05:06,537
at least as far as my feelings go regarding
the Runaways television series. If you listen

53
00:05:06,577 --> 00:05:11,420
to our review of the Runaways season two, which
is the only season that we reviewed on this

54
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:17,164
podcast, you'll note that I didn't really like
the changes that the show had made from the

55
00:05:17,204 --> 00:05:21,552
original comic book series, which I... I thought
it was a lot more exciting than the television

56
00:05:21,592 --> 00:05:25,735
show. The television show kind of became its
own thing. And I'll admit that it was well

57
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:30,899
cast and the special effects were great, but
it was largely a teen drama, which is how I

58
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:34,962
guess you could describe the comic book series.
But there was a lot more adrenaline and suspense

59
00:05:35,283 --> 00:05:40,827
and fantastical elements in the comic book series
that weren't present in the live action show.

60
00:05:41,328 --> 00:05:46,992
But I appreciate an opinion that differs from
mine. I don't know if Colby Hentges is a fan

61
00:05:47,172 --> 00:05:51,662
of the Runaways comic books. but I know that
a lot of people really like The Runaways and

62
00:05:51,702 --> 00:05:56,504
it was always interesting to get their perspective
on why. I feel like it appealed to a younger

63
00:05:56,564 --> 00:06:00,865
generation than you and I are. Man, that's cool,
that's fine. I do have to say though that the

64
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:05,487
comic book series, while I never read it, I
am a big fan of the author, Brian K. Vaughan.

65
00:06:06,047 --> 00:06:10,228
He wrote another one of my favorite series,
Why the Last Man. It was a DC Vertigo comic

66
00:06:10,248 --> 00:06:15,398
book. Fantastic piece of literature. Brian K.
Vaughan is the man. And I kind of wish they

67
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:20,563
would have adapted the comic series more faithfully
in the television series. But critics like

68
00:06:20,603 --> 00:06:25,427
The Runaways too, so yeah, maybe it should have
got more seasons, but I think that ended due

69
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:31,652
to Marvel Studios' takeover of Marvel Television.
Yeah, that's right. Great answer, Colby. Our

70
00:06:31,712 --> 00:06:37,057
next honorable mention goes to Michael Williams.
Who said? Mike Williams, I was saying goes

71
00:06:37,077 --> 00:06:44,562
to Missouri. Live action show between DC, the
Peacemaker, and Teen Titans. Really loved Peacemaker

72
00:06:44,622 --> 00:06:50,627
the last episode where the Justice League showed
up. As far as Marvel, Falcon, Winter Soldier.

73
00:06:51,969 --> 00:06:59,255
Enjoy your show. And as always, make mine Marvel.
Take care. Yeah, in reference to the Teen Titans

74
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:04,879
series, I think he's referring to the live action
Titan series that was on Max, which I think

75
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:10,144
got better season by season. Peacemaker is also
on Max. I love that show, which was written

76
00:07:10,184 --> 00:07:15,307
by James Gunn, the new head of the DCU. And
I'm really looking forward to season two, along

77
00:07:15,327 --> 00:07:19,148
with everything else he's going to bring to
the universe. Yeah, and Michael also mentioned

78
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:23,750
for Marvel, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,
Disney Plus series, and yeah, for my money,

79
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:28,732
the first episode of that series had one of
the best MCU action scenes of all time. Great

80
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:33,614
answer, Michael. Our next honorable mention
goes to Daniel Alonso. Who said? Okay, well,

81
00:07:33,674 --> 00:07:38,956
there's only one answer for this, and it's gotta
be Daredevil. I mean, hands down. It's got

82
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:45,135
incredible fight scenes, the cinematography
is amazing. The freaking acting, the all-star

83
00:07:45,195 --> 00:07:51,377
cast, Charlie Cox, Vincent D'Onofrio, John Bernthal,
Debra Anne Wohl, like come on, it's incredible.

84
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:57,140
And Daredevil, oh my god, we finally get Daredevil
how he should be. Dude, there's not enough

85
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,082
that I can say about that. I mean, yeah, hands
down, it's gotta be Daredevil, there's no other

86
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:05,924
answer. That's it. Daredevil's not just one
of the best superhero television series out

87
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:10,246
there, it's one of the best television series
of all time, period. It's so well made. and

88
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:15,387
I think it truly transcends the comic book genre
and totally appeals to fans of crime series

89
00:08:15,747 --> 00:08:20,508
and stuff like that as well. I can't say enough
good things about the Daredevil show. Yeah,

90
00:08:20,528 --> 00:08:25,770
I definitely agree with you about it transcending
the genre, particularly in season 3. That season,

91
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,872
I was just riveted every episode. It was so
damn good. I've gotten pretty nervous with

92
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:37,473
the character popping up in the Spider-Man movie
and She-Hulk. I really don't want Disney to

93
00:08:37,553 --> 00:08:41,738
ruin the character. But it looks like with all
of the different crew changes and reshoots

94
00:08:41,778 --> 00:08:46,260
that they've done with the upcoming Daredevil
Born Again series, it should be pretty good.

95
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,861
I don't think there's anything to worry about
regarding the show making its transition from

96
00:08:50,921 --> 00:08:55,942
Netflix to Disney+, because it's been confirmed
that on Disney+, Daredevil Born Again is going

97
00:08:55,962 --> 00:09:00,363
to be TVMA. And judging from, you know, the
leaked trailers and stuff that have come out

98
00:09:00,403 --> 00:09:05,285
of New York Comic Con and D23, it's going to
be incredible, still keeping in the tone of

99
00:09:05,305 --> 00:09:09,954
the Netflix show. And they announced the premiere
date for... Daredevil Born Again. It's going

100
00:09:09,974 --> 00:09:15,677
to be March 4th, 2025, and the season is going
to be nine episodes. Are you serious? I didn't

101
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:19,560
know that. Oh, it's going to be forever until
March now. Dig it. Yeah, it's quite a ways

102
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:25,223
away. But good things come to those who wait,
as they say. We as comic book movie fans know

103
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:29,645
this most of the time. Great answer, Daniel.
We want to give a quick shout out to Mason

104
00:09:29,705 --> 00:09:34,768
Thompson for taking the time to visit our website
and record an answer. But the winner of this

105
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:40,924
week's no prize is Travis Bailey. Who said?
Hey, what's up Travis Bailey. Shout out to

106
00:09:40,964 --> 00:09:46,849
my good twin. Look, Marvel, everybody knows
this, dominates every form of media as far

107
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:53,895
as common sense is concerned. Print, movies,
animation, yes, animation. But if we're being

108
00:09:53,955 --> 00:09:59,059
honest, it has to be watchmen. I mean, the product
that they put out on HBO, I mean, known for

109
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:04,604
pressing these television, it did not disappoint.
Got some Emmy nods. It validates everything

110
00:10:04,904 --> 00:10:10,023
incessant DC fans say about their work. I think
the main point that we want to take away from

111
00:10:10,103 --> 00:10:16,769
Travis Bailey's answer is that Marvel dominates
everything over DC, including animation. Except

112
00:10:16,829 --> 00:10:22,774
apparently television, which I guess you're
admitting. No, yeah, Watchmen hands down is

113
00:10:22,814 --> 00:10:27,838
the best series that I think has ever been produced
as an adaptation from the comics. Now, of course,

114
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:33,422
the Watchmen series was a sequel to the Watchmen
comic, but holy cow, was it a phenomenal one.

115
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:38,859
It was a better sequel than anything DC has
produced since then. including Doomsday Clock.

116
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:44,203
I don't know if Watchmen is a better show than
Daredevil. Yes, it is. But it's up there. It

117
00:10:44,484 --> 00:10:48,987
was a really damn good show for sure. And not
only did it get a few Emmy nods, it freaking

118
00:10:49,047 --> 00:10:54,292
won more Emmys the year it came out than any
other show it was competing against. It won

119
00:10:54,312 --> 00:10:59,857
a Peabody Award, which is unheard of. Like a
television series, one based off of a comic

120
00:10:59,877 --> 00:11:05,666
book that wins a Peabody, incredible. Yeah,
if you haven't seen Watchmen on HBO, and you're

121
00:11:05,686 --> 00:11:09,127
a fan of Watchmen, definitely check it out,
because it was really well conceived, really

122
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:14,610
well made. Yeah, Damon Lindelof served as the
showrunner for Watchmen, and he's also serving

123
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:19,672
as the showrunner for the upcoming Lantern series,
which gets me super, super pumped for that.

124
00:11:20,052 --> 00:11:23,894
So congrats to Travis Bailey for winning this
week's No Prize. If you, the listener, want

125
00:11:23,934 --> 00:11:28,476
a shot at winning your own No Prize, stay tuned
to later on in this episode when we'll be asking

126
00:11:28,536 --> 00:11:32,477
another question of the week. And now that that's
done, on to the news.

127
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:44,765
So last week, James Gunn on social media not
only confirmed that crypto will be in the upcoming

128
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:50,268
Superman movie that's going to hit theaters
in 2025, but he also shared the first look

129
00:11:50,368 --> 00:11:55,411
at crypto as he's sitting next to Superman on
the moon overlooking the planet Earth. And

130
00:11:55,471 --> 00:12:00,954
I just want to give the dog a huge hug because
he's so cuddly. And don't deny you don't either.

131
00:12:00,974 --> 00:12:06,237
I'm good. I'm good, bro. You know, you know
that is just like the scruffiest, just fluffiest

132
00:12:06,277 --> 00:12:10,712
dog ever. want to pet that guy. In the social
media post where he made the announcement,

133
00:12:11,092 --> 00:12:15,955
James Gunn talked about the inspiration for
including crypto in this movie and it was a

134
00:12:16,116 --> 00:12:20,418
dog that he had rescued named Ozu and he was
talking about how when they first got him he

135
00:12:20,438 --> 00:12:25,422
was just destroying everything in the house
and it kind of inspired James Gunn to be like

136
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:31,426
oh what if Ozu had superpowers like that would
be so much more wild and possibly humorous.

137
00:12:31,586 --> 00:12:37,518
So it kind of indicated a comedic tone that
crypto may have in the Superman movie. So does

138
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:42,422
that mean that the Superman movie is gonna be
about how Superman gets crypto? No, I don't

139
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:48,727
believe so. We're entering the DCU as an established
universe. And so I think crypto is just gonna

140
00:12:48,747 --> 00:12:53,091
be, you know, one of Superman's allies in the
film. I'm not sure how large of a role he'll

141
00:12:53,131 --> 00:12:59,056
have in the movie, considering it looks like
he's CG and he may be expensive to produce.

142
00:12:59,336 --> 00:13:03,520
But I also just love the fact that they're including
him. We haven't seen crypto since League of

143
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:09,084
Superpets, the animated film. But it's really
cool to actually see him make the jump to live

144
00:13:09,144 --> 00:13:13,407
action. What do you think of the image itself
of Superman sitting nice to crypto on the moon?

145
00:13:13,907 --> 00:13:19,030
I love this image. I really freaking love it.
It made me so much happier than I thought it

146
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:24,554
would and just kind of really washed all of
the bad taste of Joker 2 out of my mouth. I

147
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:28,617
think DC fans are getting a little bit overhyped
about this image because essentially you're

148
00:13:28,637 --> 00:13:33,861
just looking at Superman's back and crypto's
back and it's like, who cares, right? But it's

149
00:13:33,881 --> 00:13:38,736
like an iconic. looking image like it just framed
really well as they look over the planet and

150
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:43,939
it's just a joy I guess to see Superman with
his dog. I guess so. You cold-hearted piece

151
00:13:43,959 --> 00:13:50,983
of shit! Why? Because I'm not gushing all over
this image. It's been posted to death by this

152
00:13:51,023 --> 00:13:56,026
point. Like I'm sick of seeing it as a teaser
image. It's fine but like I'm waiting for a

153
00:13:56,106 --> 00:14:01,649
trailer already. Oh same. Yeah absolutely. The
movie comes out in summer of next year so...

154
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:07,409
I actually think we'll be getting a teaser trailer
soon, maybe by the holiday season. Yeah, I'd

155
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:11,412
put my money on that. Around Christmas time
we'll get the trailer for Superman. Fingers

156
00:14:11,452 --> 00:14:15,955
crossed. Moving on to the trailers that were
released during New York Comic Con, starting

157
00:14:15,995 --> 00:14:20,778
with Creature Commandos. This show is coming
out December 5th and it's going to kick off

158
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:25,942
James Gunn's DCU. We've already seen some footage
from the teaser trailer, but this is the first

159
00:14:25,982 --> 00:14:30,905
official trailer that has been released by DC
Studios. The premise of the show is setting

160
00:14:30,965 --> 00:14:37,072
up. is that because the government found out
about Amanda Waller's Task Force X or Suicide

161
00:14:37,112 --> 00:14:43,034
Squad due to the events at the end of Peacemaker
Season 1, she's now forced to pull from a different

162
00:14:43,074 --> 00:14:48,536
set of prisoners, namely ones that aren't human,
in order to accomplish these dangerous and

163
00:14:48,576 --> 00:14:54,659
possible tasks, and that is the Creature Commandos.
From this trailer, it looks like the core team's

164
00:14:54,699 --> 00:15:03,955
roster is going to be The Bride, Dr. Phosphorus,
Weasel, Dr. Nina Mazursky, and GI Robot. Frankenstein

165
00:15:03,995 --> 00:15:07,758
is also going to be making appearances and he's
going to be voiced by David Harbour, but it

166
00:15:07,778 --> 00:15:12,541
looks like maybe he's just a side character
for the team. He won't be there the whole time.

167
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:18,305
And of course, Rick Flagg Sr. voiced by Frank
Urlo is also a member of the team. Is the villain

168
00:15:18,645 --> 00:15:23,669
Magenta at the beginning of this trailer? It
looks like her kinda. I don't believe so. I

169
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:27,551
don't actually know who this character is. I
think it's Cersei because I

170
00:15:30,738 --> 00:15:35,862
in the show. So my bet is that it's her. We
also get to see Clayface in this trailer, which

171
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:39,325
I thought was pretty surprising because I didn't
know he was going to show up either. Yeah,

172
00:15:39,365 --> 00:15:43,908
Clayface is just showing up everywhere, isn't
he? This is like the year of Clayface, I swear

173
00:15:43,928 --> 00:15:49,913
to God. Between Suicide Squad, Isekai, Batman
Caped Crusader, and his guest appearance in

174
00:15:49,953 --> 00:15:54,077
Kite Men, hell yeah, season one. Yeah, he's
all over the place. Yeah, it's kind of cool.

175
00:15:54,137 --> 00:16:00,422
And he looks really cool in this trailer. I
swear if they adapt this version to live I

176
00:16:00,442 --> 00:16:04,944
will lose my mind, because that would just be
incredible. There's also some cameos from some

177
00:16:04,984 --> 00:16:10,967
rather obscure characters, including Kongarilla
and Rubber Duck. I've never heard of that character

178
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:14,489
before, but apparently it's a thing. The show
looks like it's going to be really good. I

179
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:18,752
especially like the character arcs that it looks
like we're getting for The Bride and Dr. Nina

180
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:23,694
Mazursky, and G.I. Robot. I think the show is
going to be really heartfelt, and I can't wait

181
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:27,896
to see it when it comes out in early December.
This trailer definitely has me pumped for the

182
00:16:27,937 --> 00:16:32,741
show. I love the creature commandos. It does
look like this one's going to be gratuitously

183
00:16:32,801 --> 00:16:38,347
violent, but that's pretty much in keeping with
James Gunn's The Suicide Squad film and Peacemaker,

184
00:16:38,447 --> 00:16:42,912
so I'm not surprised. Yeah, as everyone knows,
the Creature Commandos are a team comprised

185
00:16:43,093 --> 00:16:46,677
of kind of spooky characters, so that brings
us to our question of the week.

186
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:57,619
Who do you think is the scariest Marvel or DC
character and why? Yeah, we'll be going through

192
00:17:20,374 --> 00:17:25,855
Be sure to answer before October 26th. Another
DC trailer also came out during New York Comic

193
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:31,357
Con, Batman Ninja versus Yakuza League. I loved
the first Batman Ninja and everything I see

194
00:17:31,397 --> 00:17:37,399
coming out about this sequel just gets me more
and more pumped for this film. In the previous

195
00:17:37,439 --> 00:17:42,621
teaser trailer that we got for this, we speculated
that perhaps the actions from the first film

196
00:17:42,981 --> 00:17:51,131
resulted. in the future being affected and influencing
the modern world with more Japanese elements,

197
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:56,613
particularly in Gotham City. But it actually
looks like this alternate dimension is being

198
00:17:56,693 --> 00:18:03,015
folded on top of Gotham City, sort of like origami.
And in this alternate dimension of Japan, it's

199
00:18:03,075 --> 00:18:09,596
ruled over by a Yakuza League or different Justice
League members that are like evil Yakuza versions

200
00:18:09,636 --> 00:18:13,097
of themselves, or at least most of them are.
It kind of seems like Wonder Woman might be

201
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:18,744
good in this movie whereas everyone else is
bad? Well it's like competing Japanese factions.

202
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:24,286
The Ninkyo versus the Yakuza. And I thought
it was really cool how it looks like the islands

203
00:18:24,306 --> 00:18:30,248
of Japan are over Gotham City. So you have things
like Yakuza storms where they just rain down

204
00:18:30,328 --> 00:18:35,250
onto Gotham City and cause chaos. Which is wild
because the Yakuza storms are actually Yakuza

205
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:41,453
gangsters just like flooding a city. It's pretty
cool. The character designs as we've said before

206
00:18:43,670 --> 00:18:47,451
Particularly Aquaman as we get to see a little
bit more of him. The different looks for Wonder

207
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:51,593
Woman are also really cool I can't wait to see
Superman. They're still hiding him from us

208
00:18:51,773 --> 00:18:55,394
I figure he's gonna be the main bad guy or at
least like the final bad guy because it definitely

209
00:18:55,414 --> 00:19:00,156
looks like Rosselle Gould is heavily involved
in whatever is going on with these dimensional

210
00:19:00,196 --> 00:19:04,398
folds. The story looks like it's gonna be really
good too really heartfelt You know like the

211
00:19:04,438 --> 00:19:08,200
line from Batman who says it's most dangerous
when a friend becomes an enemy and things like

212
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,201
that seems pretty deep And everything the only
thing that I don't like about this project

213
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:17,791
is the animation itself is no good. Especially
coming off of like Suicide Squad Isekai. Yeah.

214
00:19:17,911 --> 00:19:22,852
And how that was hand drawn traditional anime
animation. And you go to this computer generated

215
00:19:22,892 --> 00:19:27,834
shit. There were parts of Batman Ninja in the
first one that were computer animated that

216
00:19:27,874 --> 00:19:32,555
I really liked, like the statues of the villains
that Catwoman was introducing Batman to when

217
00:19:32,575 --> 00:19:37,916
she was setting up the feudal world that Batman
was currently in within Japan. I do hope we'll

218
00:19:37,936 --> 00:19:44,439
get more animation in that style, but who knows?
I agree. Like Suicide Squad Isekai totally

219
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:49,604
ruined a lot of other DC animation for me, but
I'm still looking forward to the story for

220
00:19:49,644 --> 00:19:55,088
this one. It's coming out in early 2025. We
don't have an exact release date yet, but look

221
00:19:55,108 --> 00:20:02,154
for it then. But speaking of bad-looking CG,
the last trailer we want to talk about this

222
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:08,019
episode is the official trailer for Watchmen
Chapter 2. Now, if you've listened to our review

223
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:16,057
for Watchmen Chapter 1, care for that film.
It was kind of pointless. Yeah, being an inferior

224
00:20:16,097 --> 00:20:22,401
version adaptation-wise of the Zack Snyder 2009
live-action film, this kind of felt a little

225
00:20:22,421 --> 00:20:27,285
bit redundant. And the second part to the Watchmen
animated movie also looks the same. I mean,

226
00:20:27,305 --> 00:20:31,928
yeah, not only was it not as good as Zack Snyder's
adaptation, it's just not as good as the book

227
00:20:32,008 --> 00:20:38,272
either in that it tries to be a perfect adaptation
of the book and yet fails to capture a lot

228
00:20:38,292 --> 00:20:44,819
of the things of what makes the book in the
form of the comic medium so special. So considering

229
00:20:44,859 --> 00:20:50,721
that, it's really hard to get excited for Watchmen
Chapter 2. The animation still looks like it's

230
00:20:50,741 --> 00:20:56,122
going to be very wooden and not nearly as good
as some of DC's other animated projects. That

231
00:20:56,142 --> 00:21:02,264
being said, the second half of the Watchmen
story has some incredible moments like Rorschach's

232
00:21:02,364 --> 00:21:07,565
origin story, the prison escape scene, the fight
in Karnak. So there's a lot to look forward

233
00:21:07,585 --> 00:21:12,727
to story-wise here. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, some
of the best moments from Watchmen happen in

234
00:21:12,747 --> 00:21:17,950
the second half. The first half was really all
built up for this, right? Including a killer

235
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:23,032
twist. I'm really interested in seeing the design
of the squid and how they incorporate that

236
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:28,795
here. I wonder if it'll be as good as what they
showed in the HBO Watchmen series, or if it'll

237
00:21:28,815 --> 00:21:34,217
look more like the comics or what it'll look
like. Well, based on what we've seen from this

238
00:21:34,257 --> 00:21:38,785
two part film. It's gonna be almost exactly
like what we've seen in the comics considering

239
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:44,530
that they're really trying their hardest to
capture artist Dave Gibbons style. It's not

240
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:49,654
gonna top what we saw in the Watchmen television
series. I already know that. I'm already prepared

241
00:21:49,794 --> 00:21:55,820
for that. Really, I'm prepared for the whole
damn thing because, again, I read this book

242
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:01,405
like once every year, every two years. I know
it by heart, basically. So there's not much

243
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:05,630
to look forward to. Maybe for people new to
this story, but like we said in our review,

244
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,591
I think if someone's coming in new, I would
just recommend a different adaptation than

245
00:22:09,631 --> 00:22:14,933
this one. Or just, you know, read the original
comic. Oh, absolutely. I have multiple versions

246
00:22:15,073 --> 00:22:18,914
of the graphic novel for that very purpose.
Someone tells me they haven't read Watchmen.

247
00:22:18,934 --> 00:22:25,116
I'm like, here, take it. Just take it and read
it. I'm not anticipating any kind of surprise

248
00:22:25,296 --> 00:22:29,897
with this adaptation. Again, I think it's going
to be very much by the numbers from the comic,

249
00:22:30,397 --> 00:22:37,475
but who knows? We'll see. Part two of this film
is coming out on digital and Blu-ray on November

250
00:22:37,515 --> 00:22:43,197
26th. So we will be reviewing this in a little
bit over a month. If you haven't read Watchmen

251
00:22:43,377 --> 00:22:49,218
and don't know how it ends, read the comic before
part two comes out and before you watch that.

252
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:54,700
Or if you're a Marvel fan, just go on living
your life because who cares? If you're a Marvel

253
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,841
fan, you should read Watchmen so that you know
what a good comic is.

254
00:23:07,022 --> 00:23:10,806
But that does it for all the news for this episode,
so let's go ahead and get into our main event,

255
00:23:11,107 --> 00:23:18,436
which will be a team duel between the spook-tastic
Marvel and DC teams of creature commandos and

256
00:23:18,476 --> 00:23:19,597
the Legion of Monsters.

257
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,753
Alright, Creature Commandos vs. The Legion of
Monsters. We decided to go with this duel episode

258
00:23:39,773 --> 00:23:43,956
along with the executive producers because it
was just too good of an opportunity to pass

259
00:23:44,036 --> 00:23:48,259
up. You know, we got a lot of great feedback
last year when we did the deceased vs. Marvel

260
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:54,244
zombies and this is always a fun time of year
to do these type of duel episodes. It is nice

261
00:23:54,264 --> 00:23:58,635
to do something special around these seasons.
Yeah, absolutely. Especially when it comes

262
00:23:58,675 --> 00:24:02,679
to characters that I love like the Creature
Commandos. Yeah, we figured this would be good

263
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:07,664
to do in lead up to the Creature Commandos animated
television show that'll be coming out in a

264
00:24:07,704 --> 00:24:12,468
few months. Both teams are comprised of like
classic Halloween creatures. It's kind of like

265
00:24:12,508 --> 00:24:18,274
the Monster Mash of Marvel and DC. Absolutely.
This is going to be a graveyard smash. When

266
00:24:18,294 --> 00:24:22,918
did the Creature Commandos originate in DC Comics
in terms of publication history? Because the

267
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:27,580
Legion of Monsters came out in the 1970s. And
actually, the Legion of Monsters number one

268
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:33,403
issue was published by an imprint of Marvel
called Curtis Comics that refused to carry

269
00:24:33,443 --> 00:24:38,006
the Comics Code Authority seal. So they could
tell these more supernatural stories, like

270
00:24:38,026 --> 00:24:43,369
with Dracula and Frankenstein and the creature
from the Black Lagoon, or Manfibian, as he's

271
00:24:43,389 --> 00:24:48,271
known in Marvel. Well, I guess it looks like
Marvel came out first here, because the Creature

272
00:24:48,291 --> 00:24:55,166
Commandos didn't come out until 1980. What a
rip-off. Damn ripoff. Hey, hey, it's like you

273
00:24:55,206 --> 00:24:59,307
always tell me. It's not about who comes first,
it's about who does it better. So Legion of

274
00:24:59,327 --> 00:25:04,329
Monsters then. Alright, but to explain the methodology
behind our duels, let's go to our sentient

275
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:10,270
duel simulator Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ and IK
tell our listeners how you go about determining

276
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:15,532
a winner in our duel matchups. Yes, of course,
sir. The way I determine a winner between the

277
00:25:15,572 --> 00:25:20,913
two teams is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations
between every character on each team using

278
00:25:20,953 --> 00:25:26,435
their statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation is
a probabilistic model used to determine outcomes

279
00:25:26,455 --> 00:25:31,676
through random sampling. In this case, I randomised
the statistics along a normal distribution

280
00:25:31,996 --> 00:25:36,617
as a way to simulate the many variables that
can occur during battle. The stat parameters

281
00:25:36,657 --> 00:25:41,039
are based on the official Marvel power grid,
from which the DC characters statistics are

282
00:25:41,079 --> 00:25:47,080
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are
included such as range, damage potential, versatility

283
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,202
and perception in order to create a more detailed
and accurate simulation. The results of the

284
00:25:52,262 --> 00:25:57,745
49,000 simulations provide a percentage of wins
for each character on both teams. The team

285
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:01,827
with the higher average win rate is declared
the victor as they have a higher probability

286
00:26:01,887 --> 00:26:07,390
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,
neither team should win 100% of the matches.

287
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:12,013
The comic book stories have shown that there's
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so

288
00:26:12,053 --> 00:26:15,915
the confidence rate of my method falls in line
with the precedents that have been established

289
00:26:15,935 --> 00:26:21,518
in the source material. My mathematical simulations
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are

290
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:27,459
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes
tabulated for determination of the winner.

291
00:26:27,479 --> 00:26:32,761
Thanks AJ9K! Before we run the simulations though,
we like to break down each team's histories

292
00:26:32,941 --> 00:26:39,263
and rosters before improvising a scenario on
how we imagine one of the thousands of simulations

293
00:26:39,283 --> 00:26:44,364
would play out beat for beat. And I believe
it's my turn to go first with the DC team's

294
00:26:44,404 --> 00:26:49,674
backstory, so let me tell you all about the
creature commandos. Now during World War II,

295
00:26:49,714 --> 00:26:55,415
the United States government launched a top-secret
project known as Project M, aimed at creating

296
00:26:55,596 --> 00:27:02,457
experimental super-soldiers and psychological
weapons. Led by Professor Mazursky, the program

297
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:07,719
operated from a hidden laboratory beneath the
Statue of Liberty. Recognizing the fear that

298
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:13,861
monsters evoked, Mazursky aimed to weaponize
this by transforming volunteers into grotesque

299
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:19,914
beings inspired by classic horror archetypes.
The first volunteers included Warren Griffith,

300
00:27:20,294 --> 00:27:25,996
a soldier suffering from delusions of lycanthropy,
who was transformed into a werewolf. Vincent

301
00:27:26,036 --> 00:27:32,858
Velcro, a court-martialed soldier turned into
a vampire, and Elliot Lucky Taylor, a severely

302
00:27:32,898 --> 00:27:38,800
wounded soldier reconstructed as a patchwork
Frankenstein-esque monster. Dr. Myrna Rhodes,

303
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:44,581
a plastic surgeon exposed to mutagenic chemicals
that transformed her into a gorgon with snakes

304
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:50,844
for hair, also joined the team as Dr. Medusa.
This team became the Creature Commandos, led

305
00:27:50,884 --> 00:27:55,726
by the hardened Lieutenant Matthew Shreve, who
often viewed the commandos as mere tools for

306
00:27:55,746 --> 00:28:00,489
the war effort. The Creature Commandos were
deployed across Europe and beyond, taking on

307
00:28:00,569 --> 00:28:05,911
both conventional and supernatural threats.
Their first mission in France involved destroying

308
00:28:05,991 --> 00:28:12,394
Nazi android duplicates of allied leaders, proving
their effectiveness as a strike team. Operating

309
00:28:12,474 --> 00:28:20,680
out of London, including the mission to rescue
Dr. Rene Frederique, a scientist with knowledge

310
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:26,104
of chemical nerve gas. Though the commandos
initially rescued a Nazi agent posing as Frederique.

311
00:28:26,605 --> 00:28:32,490
In a rare moment of humanity, the agent sacrificed
herself to save the team, challenging the commandos

312
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:38,375
perspective. The team eventually found the real
Dr. Frederique in a death camp, but under orders,

313
00:28:38,815 --> 00:28:43,434
killed her to prevent her knowledge from falling
into enemy hands. This mission deeply affected

314
00:28:43,474 --> 00:28:48,675
the team, particularly Lucky Taylor, who attempted
suicide afterward. Though doctors repaired

315
00:28:48,695 --> 00:28:54,257
his body, the trauma left him mute. As their
missions continued, the commandos faced morally

316
00:28:54,317 --> 00:29:00,238
ambiguous tasks, testing their loyalty and moral
compass. One mission involved eliminating Nazi

317
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:05,160
super soldier children at a German boarding
school. While the commandos hesitated to kill

318
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,741
children, Shreef took matters into his own hands
and gunned them down, creating a rift within

319
00:29:10,781 --> 00:29:16,992
the team. Despite these dark tasks, the commandos
also found moments of redemption. In one mission,

320
00:29:17,232 --> 00:29:22,654
they rescued a group of blind French children
from a Nazi attack, earning medals of honor.

321
00:29:23,074 --> 00:29:27,837
Yet internal conflict persisted and Shreeve
briefly left the team, feeling his leadership

322
00:29:27,857 --> 00:29:34,299
style was too harsh. After a successful mission,
rescuing French civilians, Shreeve was reinstated.

323
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:39,261
In 1943, the commandos were sent to the South
Pacific to investigate the disappearance of

324
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:44,747
of allied planes near Dinosaur Island. There
they discovered a hidden Japanese naval fleet

325
00:29:44,847 --> 00:29:49,828
and turned the island's dinosaurs against the
enemy ships, using the creatures as weapons.

326
00:29:50,128 --> 00:29:55,310
Shrieve documented the dinosaurs for military
intelligence, but Velcro destroyed the photographs,

327
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:00,371
fearing that war would bring destruction to
these creatures. The commandos later returned

328
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:06,013
to Dinosaur Island where they encountered Jake,
the first GI robot. Together they discovered

329
00:30:06,113 --> 00:30:12,568
a supposed lost colony of Atlantis. responsible
for sinking ships. Atlantean robots had taken

330
00:30:12,608 --> 00:30:17,230
control of Jake, but he ultimately overrode
their programming and sacrificed himself to

331
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:22,753
destroy the colony, preventing further attacks
on allied vessels. Following Jake's destruction,

332
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:28,596
the commandos met his replacement Jake II, who
joined the team and expanded their capabilities.

333
00:30:29,117 --> 00:30:35,280
As World War II neared its end, Project Am tasked
the commandos with a final mission, piloting

334
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:41,954
an experimental The rocket malfunctioned, veering
off course and drifting into space with the

335
00:30:41,974 --> 00:30:48,002
commandos aboard. With the original team lost,
Project M later shifted its focus to creating

336
00:30:48,202 --> 00:30:53,369
new super soldiers. Over time, the program produced
a series of new recruits to replace the original

337
00:30:53,409 --> 00:30:59,158
commandos, expanding its reach beyond traditional
monsters. One such recruit was Captain Lucius

338
00:30:59,198 --> 00:31:04,961
Hunter, who took over leadership duties in place
of Shrieve. Hunter, an older veteran who had

339
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:09,743
undergone extensive rejuvenation therapies,
led a new iteration of the creature commandos

340
00:31:09,843 --> 00:31:17,307
called M-Team Alpha. M-Team Alpha included fresh
faces like a Ten, a mummy-like communication

341
00:31:17,347 --> 00:31:23,870
specialist, the Bog Man, an amphibious creature
resembling a Gill Man, and Gunner Mackie, a

342
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:29,973
revived World War II soldier turned into a cyborg
zombie. This modernized version of the Creature

343
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:35,017
Commandos continued Project M's legacy, adapting
to new threats and expanding its roster to

344
00:31:35,077 --> 00:31:40,280
face evolving challenges. Years later, the original
Creature Commandos were discovered aboard an

345
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:45,984
alien vessel controlled by Brainiac. Freed from
stasis, they joined forces with other heroes

346
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:52,048
to fight their captors. Upon returning to Earth,
the team was captured by General Sam Lane and

347
00:31:52,168 --> 00:31:53,569
integrated into Project

348
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:02,654
Cryptonians. Despite their capture, the Commandos
were never deployed against the Cryptonians

349
00:32:02,774 --> 00:32:07,957
during the tensions between Earth and New Krypton.
Following the disbandment of Project 7734,

350
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:14,120
Maxwell Lord took control of the Commandos and
deployed them against the Justice League International.

351
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:19,603
Under Lord's telepathic influence, the Commandos
fought for a time but eventually broke free

352
00:32:19,643 --> 00:32:24,925
from his mind control. Realizing they no longer
had a clear purpose or allegiance in this new

353
00:32:25,045 --> 00:32:30,279
era, The Commandos faced uncertainty as their
monstrous forms and tortured pasts left them

354
00:32:30,379 --> 00:32:36,300
relics of a bygone age. In the post-Flashpoint
timeline, the Creature Commandos were reimagined

355
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:42,842
as field operatives for the secretive organization,
SHADE, or the Superhuman Advanced Defense Executive.

356
00:32:43,202 --> 00:32:48,704
This version of the team was led by Frankenstein,
replacing the original leader, Matthew Shreve.

357
00:32:49,044 --> 00:32:55,578
Dr. Nina Mazursky, now a scientist and geneticist
for SHADE, spearheaded the program, using the

358
00:32:55,638 --> 00:33:01,739
legacy of Project M to design a new generation
of creature commandos. Mazursky herself transformed

359
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:07,441
into a hybrid amphibious creature resembling
a Gill-Man to better fight alongside her creations.

360
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:13,263
Vincent Velcorro was again turned into a vampire,
with his abilities derived from a modified

361
00:33:13,303 --> 00:33:18,964
version of Dr. Kirk Langstrom's Manbat serum,
wherein Griffith retained his werewolf form,

362
00:33:19,384 --> 00:33:23,665
now more stable and controlled, allowing him
to harness his primal nature more effectively.

363
00:33:24,118 --> 00:33:29,681
The team also included Khalees, an enigmatic
Egyptian mummy whose origin remained a mystery,

364
00:33:30,022 --> 00:33:35,826
but who served as the team's medic. Under Frankenstein's
leadership, the commandos tackled a range of

365
00:33:35,886 --> 00:33:40,669
supernatural threats. One of their missions
involved combating giant monsters emerging

366
00:33:40,729 --> 00:33:45,713
from Bone Lake, Washington, showcasing their
role as humanity's frontline against the monstrous

367
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:51,857
and supernatural. The team faced personal challenges
as well. The bride, Frankenstein's estranged

368
00:33:51,937 --> 00:33:57,707
wife, departed after learning the fate of their
son, leaving a void in the team's dynamic.

369
00:33:58,007 --> 00:34:03,369
Despite their monstrous appearances, the Commandos
remained dedicated to defending humanity, evolving

370
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:08,770
under Mazurski's guidance as she continued merging
cutting-edge science with the macabre legacy

371
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:15,652
of Project M. Team-wise, I knew that for my
seven-person roster, I'd want a blend of the

372
00:34:15,852 --> 00:34:21,458
old, original team members that showcased classic
monster archetypes with the newer more tech

373
00:34:21,498 --> 00:34:26,061
and occult focused commandos that we've seen
in recent iterations of the team. From the

374
00:34:26,161 --> 00:34:31,905
early roster, I'm including Warren Griffith,
the werewolf, Vincent Velcoro, the vampire,

375
00:34:32,425 --> 00:34:40,671
Dr. Mira Rhodes, aka Dr. Medusa, and the GI
robot, Jake 2. Noticeably absent from this

376
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:47,355
original roster is Lieutenant Shreve, because
who wants a human on a monster team, and Lucky

377
00:34:47,395 --> 00:34:52,683
Taylor, whom I'm replacing with Frankenstein.
who you can learn more about in our Frankenstein

378
00:34:52,703 --> 00:34:58,529
vs Bloodstone duel episode. Along for the ride
will be Frankenstein's bride, as well as a

379
00:34:58,589 --> 00:35:04,635
third agent of shade, Dr. Nina Mazursky, the
aquatic kill woman responsible for creating

380
00:35:04,695 --> 00:35:10,101
the newest versions of the commandos. So to
recap, that's Frankenstein, his bride, Lady

381
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:18,751
Frankenstein, the werewolf Griffith, the vampire
Vel'Koro, Dr. Medusa, Dr. Mazursky, and Jake

382
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:23,494
II, the GI robot. I think one of the most interesting
things I learned there was that the team was

383
00:35:23,534 --> 00:35:30,239
created in World War II just because the professor
wanted soldiers that would be scary in a traditional

384
00:35:30,339 --> 00:35:36,303
Halloween monster sense. Yeah, he wanted to
scare Nazis with classic Hollywood monsters,

385
00:35:36,343 --> 00:35:43,066
essentially. That's kind of lame. That's okay.
Kind of an anticlimactic origin for the team,

386
00:35:43,247 --> 00:35:47,928
I think. Like if they were to make a creature
commandos for today, they would create soldiers

387
00:35:47,948 --> 00:35:52,289
that look like, I don't know, Freddy Krueger
or Mike Myers or something like that. I don't

388
00:35:52,309 --> 00:35:57,731
know, it seems weird. But sure, in concept,
they're a cool team, but not as cool as the

389
00:35:57,771 --> 00:36:02,813
Legion of Monsters. Let me go ahead and break
down their backstory. The Legion of Monsters

390
00:36:03,213 --> 00:36:08,215
was never a traditional superhero team. It was
a collection of outcasts brought together by

391
00:36:08,275 --> 00:36:14,400
strange circumstances and united by their monstrous
nature. The original lineup came together during

392
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:20,203
an encounter with the Starseed, the benevolent
alien entity. While investigating its appearance,

393
00:36:20,604 --> 00:36:26,488
Morbius, the living vampire, Werewolf by Night,
Man-Thing, and Ghost Rider found themselves

394
00:36:26,548 --> 00:36:32,052
drawn together. Overcome by their monstrous
hungers, Morbius and Werewolf by Night attacked

395
00:36:32,112 --> 00:36:38,424
Starseed, inadvertently causing its death. The
dying starseed, in a final act of mercy, tried

396
00:36:38,444 --> 00:36:43,887
to cure the Legion of their monstrous forms,
but was too weak to succeed. Disillusioned,

397
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:49,371
the team parted ways, barely recognizing themselves
as a team, not yet realizing that they had

398
00:36:49,411 --> 00:36:54,475
laid the foundation for something much larger.
Now, Jack Russell, also known as Werewolf by

399
00:36:54,515 --> 00:36:59,278
Night, inherited his curse from his father's
bloodline, transforming into a werewolf with

400
00:36:59,338 --> 00:37:03,561
every full moon. Though he initially lacked
control, he graduelly learned to manage his

401
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:08,552
transformations. making him a powerful ally
when the Legion briefly came together to investigate

402
00:37:08,612 --> 00:37:15,375
Starseed. Russell's superhuman strength, speed,
heightened senses, and near savers vulnerability

403
00:37:15,415 --> 00:37:20,138
to Silver made him one of the most fearsome
members of the Legion of Monsters, though the

404
00:37:20,178 --> 00:37:24,801
team's dissolution left him once again wandering
the world alone. You can learn more about him

405
00:37:25,081 --> 00:37:30,224
in our Solomon Grundy vs. Werewolf by Night
duel episode. Years later, Morbius found himself

406
00:37:30,264 --> 00:37:35,774
at the helm of a new incarnation of the Legion
of Monsters. this time with a clearer mission,

407
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:41,656
to protect monsters from being hunted. The world
had grown increasingly hostile toward any creatures

408
00:37:41,716 --> 00:37:46,537
perceived as a threat, and Morbius, along with
his old ally Man-Thing, sought to create a

409
00:37:46,577 --> 00:37:52,719
safe haven for monsters. They were soon joined
by the Living Mummy, Man-Phybian, and Simon

410
00:37:52,759 --> 00:37:59,020
Garth the Zombie. The Living Mummy, once known
as Nkantu, was the prince of a North African

411
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:05,462
tribe before being captured and cursed by Egyptian
priests. Mummified and held in a state of eternal

412
00:38:05,502 --> 00:38:11,285
life, N'Katu awoke in the modern era and joined
the Legion of Monsters. His superhuman strength,

413
00:38:11,465 --> 00:38:16,567
able to lift around 5 tons, and durability,
along with his immortality, made him a valuable

414
00:38:16,607 --> 00:38:21,589
protector of those who could not defend themselves.
Although he longed for peace, his curse bound

415
00:38:21,629 --> 00:38:26,832
him to a world he barely understood. Manphibian,
an alien who had traveled to Earth thousands

416
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:31,794
of years ago while pursuing the murderer of
his mate, also joined the Legion's ranks. His

417
00:38:31,834 --> 00:38:38,015
amphibious physiology gave him tremendous strength,
able to lift around 15 tons, sharp claws, a

418
00:38:38,035 --> 00:38:43,617
healing factor, and skin tough enough to withstand
missile attacks. Simon Garth the Zombie had

419
00:38:43,717 --> 00:38:49,018
once been a businessman in New Orleans before
being sacrificed by a voodoo cult and transformed

420
00:38:49,098 --> 00:38:54,560
into a zombie. Though bound by the amulet of
Damballa, which allowed his controller to command

421
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:59,621
him, Garth retained a shred of humanity that
fueled his desire to protect those who could

422
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:04,764
not protect themselves. As part of the Legion,
Garth used his immense strength, mystical senses,

423
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:09,448
and healing abilities to fight with the Legion
for a better future for all monsters. As the

424
00:39:09,508 --> 00:39:15,292
Legion solidified its purpose, they established
Monster Metropolis, a sanctuary city hidden

425
00:39:15,332 --> 00:39:20,596
beneath the streets of New York in the Moorlach
tunnels. This underground refuge provided safety

426
00:39:20,636 --> 00:39:24,879
to countless creatures, but it also put the
Legion in direct conflict with groups like

427
00:39:24,959 --> 00:39:29,950
the Hunter of Monster Special Forces, led by
Robert Hellsguard. During one battle between

428
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:35,434
the groups, the Legion resurrected the Punisher,
transforming him into the Monsters' Frankencastle.

429
00:39:35,874 --> 00:39:40,837
With his newfound form, Frankencastle fought
alongside the Legion to defend Monster Metropolis,

430
00:39:41,277 --> 00:39:45,540
though his return to humanity would eventually
lead him away from the team. You can learn

431
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:50,783
more about this in our Red Hood vs Punisher
duel episode. As the Legion of Monsters grew,

432
00:39:50,963 --> 00:39:56,782
their ranks began to attract other powerful
beings, including the half-demon daughter of

433
00:39:56,862 --> 00:40:03,426
Marduk Kurios, aka Satan. Satana spent years
as a succubus, feeding on the souls of men

434
00:40:03,466 --> 00:40:09,309
to sustain her powers. When she joined the Legion,
her mastery over black magic, teleportation,

435
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:14,552
and hellfire proved invaluable in their battles.
Though her motivations often remained mysterious,

436
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:19,835
Satana's raw power made her a force to be reckoned
with, and her demonic nature tied her fate

437
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:25,110
to the other monsters who sought refuge in Monster
Metropolis. While the Legion of Monsters fought

438
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:30,371
to protect their own, another group was forming
in the shadows, this time under the auspices

439
00:40:30,411 --> 00:40:35,233
of SHIELD, the global peacekeeping organization.
The team was called the Howling Commandos,

440
00:40:35,253 --> 00:40:39,894
and they were a special unit tasked with handling
supernatural threats that ordinary agents could

441
00:40:39,914 --> 00:40:45,656
not. Based at Area 13, a secret facility designed
to contain paranormal entities, the Howling

442
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:52,014
Commandos recruited several members of the Legion
of Monsters, including the living mummy Manfibian,

443
00:40:52,254 --> 00:40:56,676
and Zombie, who formed a new strike force against
supernatural and extraterrestrial dangers.

444
00:40:57,216 --> 00:41:01,798
Alongside these veterans came new recruits,
including Nina Price, the Vampire by Night.

445
00:41:02,358 --> 00:41:08,241
Nina, the niece of Werewolf by Night, had inherited
the family's curse of lycanthropy, but was

446
00:41:08,321 --> 00:41:13,843
later bitten by a vampire, transforming her
into a hybrid of both creatures. She joined

447
00:41:13,883 --> 00:41:18,125
the Hellen Commandos to keep her powers in check,
and quickly became an integral part of the

448
00:41:18,165 --> 00:41:24,191
team. using her supernatural strength able to
lift half a ton, agility, hypnosis, fangs,

449
00:41:24,571 --> 00:41:29,512
and healing abilities to fight against mystical
threats. Her immunity to sunlight made her

450
00:41:29,553 --> 00:41:34,794
a unique asset as she could operate during the
day, something most vampires could not. Another

451
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:40,296
addition to the Howling Commandos was Glob,
a creature formed when Joe Timms, a petty criminal,

452
00:41:40,716 --> 00:41:46,277
drowned in a radioactive swamp and was resurrected
as a near indestructible monster. Despite his

453
00:41:46,317 --> 00:41:51,265
simple-mindedness, Glob's immense strength,
able to lift around 100 tons, and resilience

454
00:41:51,325 --> 00:41:55,488
made him an effective member of the Howling
Commandos, particularly in missions where brute

455
00:41:55,508 --> 00:42:01,293
force was needed. His body, made of swamp matter,
could absorb physical attacks with little effect,

456
00:42:01,613 --> 00:42:06,037
making him nearly impossible to harm. The Howling
Commandos' first major mission came when they

457
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:11,161
were called to stop the ancient sorcerer Merlin
from transforming England into a mythical kingdom.

458
00:42:11,542 --> 00:42:16,794
They launched a daring assault on Merlin's forces,
ultimately forcing the wizard to retreat. His

459
00:42:16,814 --> 00:42:21,115
victory cemented the Hellenic Commandos as a
key player in SHIELD's Supernatural division

460
00:42:21,475 --> 00:42:26,876
and the team continued to take on threats ranging
from demonic invasions to rogue mystical artifacts.

461
00:42:27,456 --> 00:42:31,418
As both the Legion of Monsters and the Hellenic
Commandos battled supernatural threats, the

462
00:42:31,458 --> 00:42:35,999
members constantly confronted the duelity of
their existence. They fought not only to protect

463
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:40,180
their fellow Monsters, but also to reconcile
the parts of themselves that were both human

464
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:45,141
and monstrous. Choosing the roster for this
Legion of Monsters team duel was particularly

465
00:42:45,181 --> 00:42:51,232
difficult. because a lot of Marvel's most prominent
supernatural characters like Morbius, Ghostwriter,

466
00:42:51,312 --> 00:42:56,094
and Man-Thing I already used in our Justice
League Dark vs. Midnight Suns duel episode.

467
00:42:56,514 --> 00:43:01,096
That being said, there was still Werewolf by
Night and a slew of other prominent Halloween-ish

468
00:43:01,116 --> 00:43:06,039
characters I could pull from for this Halloween
duel. First on my list, of course, is Werewolf

469
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,001
by Night, who was a founding member of the Legion
of Monsters and the Howling Commandos. Next

470
00:43:11,081 --> 00:43:17,009
is the Living Mummy. who was also an early member
of both teams alongside Zombie and Manfibian.

471
00:43:17,489 --> 00:43:22,092
Satana became a prominent member of the Legion
of Monsters in their second iteration, and

472
00:43:22,152 --> 00:43:27,876
from the Howling Commandos I'm pulling two members
that are largely serving as stand-ins for Legion

473
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:33,480
of Monsters characters. And that's Vampire by
Night, who's substituting for Morbius, and

474
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:38,864
Glob, who I'm substituting for Man-Thing. Because
if you're gonna have a Halloween creature duel,

475
00:43:39,324 --> 00:43:44,903
you need a Vampire and a Swamp Monster. So that's
my lineup. Werewolf by Night, The Living Mummy,

476
00:43:45,484 --> 00:43:52,328
Zombie, Manfibian, Satana, Vampire by Night,
and Glob, the Swamp Monster. Your names are

477
00:43:52,388 --> 00:43:59,212
terrible. What? Yeah. Why? I said it. Griffith,
Vel'Koro, Mizzurski, those are way better names.

478
00:43:59,532 --> 00:44:06,216
Those are just fucking last names. And? Better
than fucking Glob. Glob is a Hulk villain.

479
00:44:06,336 --> 00:44:11,973
It's a great name for a Glob-ish creature. Zombie?
Yeah, Zombie is a zombie. Do you know any other

480
00:44:12,013 --> 00:44:14,861
villains named Zombie? Just saying, it's a little
on the nose.

481
00:44:22,318 --> 00:44:27,959

podcast network rises above the rest. Prepare

Visit dynamicpodcast.com where we settle the
debate and settle the score.

489
00:45:09,590 --> 00:45:13,672
Well now that we got these teams, histories,
and rosters out of the way, let's speculate

490
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:17,955
on how one of the simulated matches will go.
Now the winning team is going to be determined

491
00:45:17,975 --> 00:45:22,579
by simulations, not the speculation, but it's
fun to imagine how the fight could play out.

492
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:28,543
AJ and IK, what are the rules of our speculation?
Well, I should say there are no rules, other

493
00:45:28,583 --> 00:45:32,986
than the teams have no prior knowledge of the
other going into the fight. All they are aware

494
00:45:33,026 --> 00:45:37,609
of starting out is that the other side is a
threat that needs to be eliminated. For the

495
00:45:37,649 --> 00:45:42,772
speculation... groups will begin approximately
50 meters apart in a nondescript environment

496
00:45:42,993 --> 00:45:47,536
that will have no bearing on the match itself,
as no environmental statistics are considered

497
00:45:47,576 --> 00:45:52,800
in my simulations. The teams must earn victory
on their own merit." Alright then, let's get

498
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:58,344
into it. The creature commandos and the legion
of monsters meet on the battlefield. Which

499
00:45:58,384 --> 00:46:02,607
team goes first? Well, I mean, I don't know
how my team would start. You know, they're

500
00:46:02,627 --> 00:46:08,651
a military team, so most of them, like Frankenstein,
Lady Frankenstein, Dr. Medusa, Jake 2, even

501
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:14,034
Nina Mazurski, they all have guns. So they're
just going to start by gunning down the League

502
00:46:14,054 --> 00:46:18,856
of Monsters and the hail of bullets. Well, you
know that most of the Legion of Monsters are

503
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:23,939
like invulnerable to gunfire, right? Like no
werewolf by night can only be killed by silver

504
00:46:23,979 --> 00:46:28,181
bullets. Same thing with vampire by night. Living
mummy and zombie, you know, they can't really

505
00:46:28,201 --> 00:46:33,124
be hurt too much by small arms fire, manfibian,
the bullets would bounce off of them and the

506
00:46:33,164 --> 00:46:37,486
glob would just like completely no sell these
bullets. So I guess the only one that could

507
00:46:37,747 --> 00:46:43,170
be shot is Satana, but she's probably also one
of the most powerful members on my team. So

508
00:46:43,230 --> 00:46:46,952
Satana is gonna dodge the bullets by flying
up into the air, and then she's just gonna

509
00:46:47,112 --> 00:46:52,416
rain down hellfire, like grenades just exploding
all over the battlefield. And it's gonna scatter

510
00:46:52,696 --> 00:46:56,758
the creature commandos all over, and it's gonna
make them stop shooting and start diving for

511
00:46:56,798 --> 00:47:03,262
cover. Okay, well, as the team scatters, I'm
gonna say that Vel'Koro... dodges the flames

512
00:47:03,302 --> 00:47:09,604
by transforming into a bat, so he's a smaller
target. And with his transformation comes a

513
00:47:09,884 --> 00:47:15,925
rolling mist that's going to surround his teammates
and hide them from the hellfire. And within

514
00:47:16,105 --> 00:47:23,247
the mist, Griffith, with his enhanced wolf senses,
he's going to track down Zombie and attack

515
00:47:23,287 --> 00:47:29,669
him, just chomping down on his bones. Why Zombie?
Because he smells bad? Because bones, man.

516
00:47:29,789 --> 00:47:35,055
Dogs love bones. Well, Zombie doesn't give a
fuck about this werewolf biting down on his

517
00:47:35,095 --> 00:47:38,977
bones. In fact, I'll do you one better. I'm
going to say that Griffith straight rips off

518
00:47:39,017 --> 00:47:46,362
zombies arm bone and swallows it. OK, so zombies
missing an arm. But all of a sudden, that arm

519
00:47:46,402 --> 00:47:51,925
is going to burst out of Griffith's chest because
it's still animated by zombie. So what Griffith

520
00:47:51,985 --> 00:47:57,568
like falls onto his back in pain and he's dead
now. And zombies arm is going to reach up evil

521
00:47:57,608 --> 00:48:01,678
death style. Zombie grabs it and attaches it
back to his shoulder. So Griffith's out of

522
00:48:01,698 --> 00:48:07,579
the match already. Okay, killing right out the
gate, I see. Well, a lot of these guys are

523
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:13,201
kind of like one trick ponies, you know. That's
true, that's fair. Well, I'm gonna say that

524
00:48:13,441 --> 00:48:18,662
as Zombie is reattaching his arm back to his
shoulder, all of a sudden, his head freaking

525
00:48:18,722 --> 00:48:24,924
explodes because Lady Frankenstein, with her
four arms and four firearms, she just blasts

526
00:48:24,964 --> 00:48:30,205
his head with like four simultaneous headshots,
turning his brain to slush. She has four arms?

527
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:34,808
Yeah, yeah, she's like Goro. She doesn't have
forearms in the television show that's coming

528
00:48:34,868 --> 00:48:39,390
up. Maybe not at the beginning, but I'm pretty
sure by the end of it she will. That's interesting,

529
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:47,375
okay. All right, so Zombie gets headshot four
times and dies, but Nina Price, you know, the

530
00:48:47,395 --> 00:48:52,338
vampire by night, she turns into her wolf form,
because, you know, in addition to being a vampire,

531
00:48:52,358 --> 00:48:58,621
she's also a werewolf. She's actually a white
wolf, unlike her uncle, who's brown. But as

532
00:48:58,721 --> 00:49:04,447
a werewolf, She uses her senses to track down
Vincent Velcoro, who's still in his vampire

533
00:49:04,467 --> 00:49:09,668
bat form, flying around. And she snatches him
out of the air with her teeth, which is gonna

534
00:49:09,708 --> 00:49:14,049
force Velcoro into his human form. And vampire
by night is gonna come out of her wolf form.

535
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:19,511
So you have two vampires standing off against
each other, except that Nina also happens to

536
00:49:19,551 --> 00:49:25,492
be a vampire hunter. So she just stakes Velcoro
through the heart, killing him. That backstabbing

537
00:49:25,573 --> 00:49:31,479
bitch! Oh, by the way, when I say bitch, I'm
only saying that because she's a wolf. Okay,

538
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:36,603
that's fair. She stabbed him in the chest, not
the back. Oh, okay. You know who is backstabbing

539
00:49:36,623 --> 00:49:42,928
though, or rather back shooting? Frankenstein.
Because as Vel'Koro is dying, Frankenstein,

540
00:49:42,968 --> 00:49:47,652
he's gonna load a silver bullet into a steam
gun, which hits like a steam powered train,

541
00:49:48,132 --> 00:49:52,716
and he shoots vampire by night's entire heart
right the hell out of her chest. Where did

542
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:57,558
he get his silver bullet from? Dude. He's going
up against monsters all the time. You think

543
00:49:57,578 --> 00:50:04,540
he doesn't carry a silver bullet? That's very
convenient, I'll say that. Werewolf by night

544
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:09,762
sees this and he's pissed and he lets out a
blood curdling howl because his niece just

545
00:50:09,802 --> 00:50:15,043
died and he goes into a rabid frenzy. And because
Frankenstein took out one of his family, now

546
00:50:15,203 --> 00:50:22,385
Werewolf is gonna take out Frankenstein's bride.
So like in this blur of teeth and claws, Werewolf

547
00:50:22,445 --> 00:50:27,462
is just gonna rip apart Lady Frankenstein. ripping
off all four of her arms in an attack that

548
00:50:27,502 --> 00:50:32,024
basically looks like she was thrown into a blender.
All of her limbs just scatter across the battlefield.

549
00:50:32,624 --> 00:50:38,125
Hmm, okay. Well, with Werewolf by Night in this
frenzy, and he's probably looking around for

550
00:50:38,165 --> 00:50:43,347
another target, and that's when he's gonna meet
the gaze of Dr. Medusa and her glowing eyes.

551
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:50,009
So BAM! Instant petrification, Werewolf by Night
is now just an angry-looking stone statue.

552
00:50:50,469 --> 00:50:55,751
She could turn people into stone? Okay, so she's
never done it in the comics, but only because

553
00:50:56,172 --> 00:51:00,934
for some reason, anytime she tried to use it
in the comics, the people that she used against

554
00:51:01,114 --> 00:51:09,479
were unable to turn into stone like robots.
Okay, that's weird. Yeah. All right. Bullshit.

555
00:51:09,739 --> 00:51:14,141
Okay. All right. So werewolf by night is a statue,
but living mummy at this point has lumbered

556
00:51:14,282 --> 00:51:18,724
over to Dr. Medusa and he's just gonna grab
her by her snake hair and just slam her to

557
00:51:18,744 --> 00:51:24,551
the ground. Yeah, and he gets bitten by her
snakes. So he's poisoned and dying now. But

558
00:51:24,851 --> 00:51:30,113
how can Living Mummy be poisoned? He doesn't
even have blood in his body. It's like a special

559
00:51:30,273 --> 00:51:36,096
magic Egyptian embalming formula. So he doesn't
get poisoned. Snake poison does nothing. And

560
00:51:36,156 --> 00:51:41,018
Living Mummy just rips Dr. Medusa's head off
like Perseus did to the mythological Medusa.

561
00:51:41,458 --> 00:51:46,640
So she's out. He just rips off her head with
his bare hands? Yeah, he's strong. He can lift

562
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:52,812
like five tons. Okay. Well, I'm going to say
that... As the living mummy is holding Dr.

563
00:51:52,852 --> 00:51:58,597
Medusa's head, suddenly he just bursts into
flames thanks to Jake Two, who transformed

564
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:04,442
his left arm into a flamethrower and is just
gousing the living mummy's very, very flammable

565
00:52:04,482 --> 00:52:09,366
body wrappings in a stream of fire. That was
actually a pretty good move because living

566
00:52:09,406 --> 00:52:14,931
mummy is pretty vulnerable to fire since he's
all desiccated and stuff, you know? But uh,

567
00:52:14,971 --> 00:52:21,020
you know who's vulnerable to basically nothing?
Glob. And he's gonna walk over to GI Robot

568
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:26,424
as he's doing this, and he's gonna completely
swallow him up in his swamp muck body. And

569
00:52:26,444 --> 00:52:30,908
the swamp matter is just gonna ooze into all
of GI Robot's inner workings, like shutting

570
00:52:30,928 --> 00:52:35,932
down his gears and his weapon systems. And Glob
is actually the strongest member out of the

571
00:52:35,972 --> 00:52:40,156
entire Legion of Monsters, you know. His strength
level approaches the Hulk, so just by like

572
00:52:40,296 --> 00:52:45,921
flexing, he completely dismantles the guy. And
then just expels all the robot parts from his

573
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:54,176
swamp body. So now G.I. Robots out of this match.
OK. Uh, well, Glob was once human, right? Yeah,

574
00:52:54,236 --> 00:53:01,162
he was a criminal named Joe Timms. That's right.
OK. So while Glob is busy shitting out Jake

575
00:53:01,202 --> 00:53:07,727
two parts from his body, that's when Dr. Nina
Mazursky is going to plunge a syringe right

576
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:13,032
into his thigh, injecting him with a formula
that's going to revert Glob back into human

577
00:53:13,092 --> 00:53:17,703
form. You know, as Joe Timms. And right when
that happens, she's gonna blast his head off

578
00:53:17,743 --> 00:53:23,565
with her energy gun. How does she know how to
turn glob back into a human? She's an expert

579
00:53:24,025 --> 00:53:30,328
in turning humans into monsters. So, yeah, she
just did a reverse formula for that. It's stupid.

580
00:53:30,348 --> 00:53:37,391
I'll allow it. All right. Well, man, Fibian
sees what Dr. Nina Masursky did, and he's a

581
00:53:37,431 --> 00:53:41,953
Gilman creature just like her. But for some
reason, she only breathes water, right? She's

582
00:53:41,993 --> 00:53:46,183
not amphibious like him. Like she always. No,
no. walks around with that water cooler helmet

583
00:53:46,363 --> 00:53:50,905
of hers. She could breathe air. Like initially
she couldn't. She had to wear that helmet full

584
00:53:50,945 --> 00:53:56,369
of water, but the mummy Khaleese made it so
that she could breathe both water and in the

585
00:53:56,489 --> 00:54:02,252
air. Oh, well regardless, Manfebian's gonna
shatter her water helmet by smacking it with

586
00:54:02,292 --> 00:54:07,715
his razor sharp claws. And all the water is
gonna come pouring out. And as she adjusts

587
00:54:07,755 --> 00:54:12,738
from breathing water to breathing air, that's
when Manfebian... grabs her energy gun from

588
00:54:12,758 --> 00:54:18,362
her hand and uses it to blast a hole through
her chest. Just destroying her lungs and destroying

589
00:54:18,943 --> 00:54:24,526
basically her life. Well I mean maybe she reaches
for another syringe to turn him human. Manfibian's

590
00:54:24,546 --> 00:54:30,470
an alien. Like what is she gonna do? Revert
him back into an alien? Yes. No. I don't know.

591
00:54:31,071 --> 00:54:38,156
She's dead. Okay. Well right when Manfibian
kills Dr. Nina Mazursky that's when Frankenstein,

592
00:54:38,556 --> 00:54:45,263
who now has six arms. picks up Manfibian because
Frankenstein collected and grafted his bride's

593
00:54:45,423 --> 00:54:51,466
arms onto his body. And so each of the bride's
forearms are holding one of Manfibian's limbs,

594
00:54:51,506 --> 00:54:55,968
just stretching them out so he can't move. While
Frankenstein is going to use his own super

595
00:54:56,048 --> 00:55:04,491
strong arms to squeeze a Manfibian's neck until
pop, just gets popped like a zit. So I just

596
00:55:04,531 --> 00:55:09,833
have Satana left, but you only have Frankenstein
left. So it's just those two left on the battlefield.

597
00:55:10,238 --> 00:55:15,761
So, Seitan is gonna swoop in and land a big
ol' smoochy smooch right on Frankenstein's

598
00:55:15,781 --> 00:55:23,045
lips. She was like, come here you big lug. Mwah!
And Frankenstein's like, whoa. And he's probably

599
00:55:23,065 --> 00:55:29,588
feeling pretty good about himself, except that
Seitan is a succubus, okay? By kissing Frankenstein,

600
00:55:29,949 --> 00:55:34,291
she just stole his soul and it comes out of
his body in the form of a butterfly out of

601
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:40,430
his mouth and his body gets all desiccated and
just goes straight to hell. And with him out,

602
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:45,213
the Legion of Monsters win. I mean, I don't
think Frankenstein was as flattered as you

603
00:55:45,253 --> 00:55:50,977
think. For one, you know, his heart belongs
to the bride. And they were actually in addition

604
00:55:50,997 --> 00:55:56,962
to grafting his bride's arms onto his body.
He also grafted her head into his chest where

605
00:55:56,982 --> 00:56:03,906
his heart is in order to save her. He's like
Quato from Total Recall. Her head is just in

606
00:56:03,966 --> 00:56:08,734
his chest. So his body has two consciousnesses
now. And while Frankenstein's soul. may have

607
00:56:08,754 --> 00:56:14,319
been stolen sure the bride is still around and
she's going to take control of the body and

608
00:56:14,779 --> 00:56:21,585
She doesn't appreciate this demon hoe trying
to make moves on her man so You know the bride

609
00:56:21,605 --> 00:56:25,869
is gonna grab Frankenstein sword which once
belonged to the Archangel Michael by the way

610
00:56:25,909 --> 00:56:32,095
So it's holy and she's gonna plunge that blade
right into Satanas head sending her back to

611
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:37,703
hell meaning the creature commandos win, uh
I'm going to say that Frankenstein meant to

612
00:56:37,743 --> 00:56:43,746
graft the bride's head onto his body, but he
just forgot to. He just did the arms. So I

613
00:56:43,766 --> 00:56:48,989
literally just said that he did that. Well,
I'm saying that he didn't that he forgot to.

614
00:56:49,529 --> 00:56:53,852
So we'll go ahead and find out which of these
scenarios happens by inputting the character

615
00:56:53,912 --> 00:57:00,235
stats into our team simulator, comparing thousands
of matrices against each other and coming back

616
00:57:00,255 --> 00:57:08,000
with a winner. A.G. 9K hit it. Inputting data.
running calculations, processing results, simulations

617
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:14,485
complete. This was actually a pretty close matchup.
I didn't think it would be that close because

618
00:57:14,586 --> 00:57:19,910
the character of Satana turned out to be way
more powerful than she had any right to be

619
00:57:19,930 --> 00:57:24,674
within this team duel. Like, she was far beyond
anybody else on either of these teams. Out

620
00:57:24,714 --> 00:57:30,554
of all of her matches, she actually won over
90% of them. So uh... Yeah, that was a little

621
00:57:30,574 --> 00:57:34,975
bit of a mismatch, including say 10 on the Legion
of Monsters. But I also had Zombie on my team,

622
00:57:35,275 --> 00:57:40,777
who was by far the weakest character out of
anybody on either team. He only won one fifth

623
00:57:40,897 --> 00:57:45,638
of all of his matches. Yeah, as we learned in
our werewolf by night versus Solomon Grundy

624
00:57:45,658 --> 00:57:52,740
match, zombies are pretty weak stat wise. But
at least even Solomon Grundy had super strength

625
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:56,921
going for him. Well, I mean, zombie has super
strength, but like zombies in general, they

626
00:57:56,941 --> 00:58:02,928
don't have. great stats in terms of speed or
range or intelligence, you know, things like

627
00:58:02,968 --> 00:58:07,971
that. So I'm just convinced that we would all
just be fine if a zombie apocalypse were to

628
00:58:07,991 --> 00:58:13,154
ever happen. You had the strongest guy and the
weakest guy. My strongest guys were actually

629
00:58:13,274 --> 00:58:19,758
Frankenstein and GI Robot. Both of those guys
ended up winning 60% each of their matches.

630
00:58:20,158 --> 00:58:27,394
And overall, the stat categories that the Leech
Dome Monsters had over the creature Like it

631
00:58:27,434 --> 00:58:33,938
is really hard to kill most of the Legion of
Monsters characters, but also strength. A lot

632
00:58:33,958 --> 00:58:39,862
of my guys were pretty damn strong. But the
Creature Commandos had intelligence and range

633
00:58:39,902 --> 00:58:44,706
going for them. Not only do we have several
doctors and members who have lived for centuries

634
00:58:44,766 --> 00:58:50,810
on the team, but they're all pretty much packing
heat as well. Yeah, yeah. A lot of my guys

635
00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:54,553
didn't have any range at all basically. They
had to get in close and personal in order to

636
00:58:54,573 --> 00:58:59,099
inflict any sort of damage. So taking all of
this into consideration, Joseph, who do you

637
00:58:59,139 --> 00:59:03,380
think came out on top? I'm gonna say it's gonna
be Legion of Monsters. I think it's gonna be

638
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:07,182
close, but I think Legion of Monsters is still
gonna come out on top largely because they're

639
00:59:07,202 --> 00:59:13,805
just more ferocious and badass. The Instagram
poll takers though disagree with me. 53% of

640
00:59:13,825 --> 00:59:19,287
them voted in favor of the creature commandos
winning this fight. I have to think that maybe

641
00:59:19,307 --> 00:59:23,469
that's just due to the upcoming television show
that's coming out, but who knows? It's gonna

642
00:59:23,489 --> 00:59:29,400
be a close match. Oh, you think so, huh? Well,
let's find out. AG90K, the results please.

643
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:38,526
Hey, Yuasa. The winner of the team matchup between
Creature Commandos and Legion of Monsters is

644
00:59:40,067 --> 00:59:49,114
Legion of Monsters. All right. They won 517
of the 1000 matches or 51.7% of the time compared

645
00:59:49,134 --> 00:59:56,150
to the Creature Commandos who won 48.3. Now
I have to say, I... I'm actually kind of surprised

646
00:59:56,370 --> 01:00:00,092
that the Legion of Monsters did not have a higher
win rate. This is a closer match than I thought

647
01:00:00,112 --> 01:00:04,474
it would be. Once we started putting in the
stats and I saw how powerful Satana was compared

648
01:00:04,494 --> 01:00:09,516
to everyone else, I was like, oh crap, I totally
am going to lose this match for sure. But I

649
01:00:09,536 --> 01:00:14,378
thought it was going to be by a lot more. So
in a way, I still feel good about this because

650
01:00:14,739 --> 01:00:18,560
my team did better than I thought we would.
Well, let's be real. If I didn't have Satana

651
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:24,062
on my Legion of Monsters team. These guys may
not have been able to pull off a victory. Like

652
01:00:24,122 --> 01:00:29,924
she was far and above everybody else. And yeah,
it was kind of a little bit of a mismatch.

653
01:00:29,964 --> 01:00:34,405
You could say or you could just say that was
strategic thinking on behalf of myself and

654
01:00:34,425 --> 01:00:39,647
the executive producers. Or you could say you
guys were a bunch of cheaters. There's also

655
01:00:39,687 --> 01:00:44,168
that you could say anything, really. You could
also just say that you chose your team wrong.

656
01:00:44,348 --> 01:00:48,829
You know, oh, I actually liked my team, though.
I'm still proud of our turnout. I liked your

657
01:00:48,869 --> 01:00:56,203
team, too. Yeah. I liked it as well in the fact
that they lost and in your face. And I hope

658
01:00:56,283 --> 01:01:04,169
that everyone's Halloween is as scary as these
results were to DC fans. OK, so not that scary

659
01:01:04,189 --> 01:01:10,575
because you guys didn't win by that much. Gotcha.
That does it for this episode, guys. AJ 9K

666
01:01:45,176 --> 01:01:51,377
upcoming Sony Marvel film, Venom the Last Dance.
I'm not expecting huge things, I'm hoping that

667
01:01:51,497 --> 01:01:57,142
it's at least better than Venom Let There Be
Carnage, but we will find out and discuss it

We'll talk to you guys next week. Up up and

673
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:27,363
away, true believers. I was working in the lab
late one night when my eyes beheld an eerie

674
01:02:27,423 --> 01:02:33,027
sight, for my monster from his slab began to
rise, and suddenly, to my surprise, he did

675
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:33,908
the monster mash.
