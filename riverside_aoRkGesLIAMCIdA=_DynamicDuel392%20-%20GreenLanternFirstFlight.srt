00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,957
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,822 --> 00:00:30,164
Dynamic duel Podcast, a weekly show where we
review superhero films and debate the superiority

3
00:00:30,204 --> 00:00:35,466
between Marvel and DC by comparing their characters
in stat-based battle simulations. I'm Johnny

4
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:41,068
DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous Joe.
And in this episode, we were supposed to be

5
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:48,471
reviewing Hulk vs. but Marvel sucks and that's
impossible to find on any streaming platform.

6
00:00:48,812 --> 00:00:54,702
So we're changing it up. Instead, we will be
doing a review of Green Lantern. first flight

7
00:00:55,162 --> 00:01:00,543
a probably superior film even though I've never
seen Hulk vs. Well, yeah, I was so surprised

8
00:01:00,563 --> 00:01:06,145
that I couldn't find Hulk vs. anywhere to stream
that wasn't like a skeezy torrent or streaming

9
00:01:06,205 --> 00:01:11,386
site. You know, the only way you can watch Hulk
vs. right now legally is by buying the Blu-ray

10
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:17,328
or DVD, which I'm not going to do because I
no longer have a Blu-ray or DVD player streaming

11
00:01:17,388 --> 00:01:21,209
all the way. Same here, but that's probably
toward detriment in cases like this. But it's

12
00:01:21,269 --> 00:01:25,550
also not like, you know, The Hulk vs DVD is
easy to buy, you just can't go to a store,

13
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:29,952
you have to like order it from Amazon or something
and have it delivered. I guarantee you it's

14
00:01:30,012 --> 00:01:35,713
in the DVD bin of my local Dollar General. I
guarantee you, no one cares that much about

15
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:40,435
it. Our executive producers cared, but I think
Green Lantern First Flight is an appropriate

16
00:01:40,455 --> 00:01:46,116
substitute considering next week's episode is
going to be Juggernaut vs Atrocitus. Atrocitus

17
00:01:46,136 --> 00:01:49,857
is a Green Lantern villain, so this episode
ties into that. Yeah, that's going to be a

18
00:01:49,897 --> 00:01:54,338
fun episode. This film is actually pretty fun
and we'll talk all about it later on in this

19
00:01:54,378 --> 00:01:58,300
episode. Before that we're gonna break down
the comic movie news from the past week of

20
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,921
which it's all DC news because Marvel's not
doing shit right now. Oh we got Deadpool and

21
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:07,962
Wolverine coming up in a few weeks so yeah we
got a lot going on. We're gonna talk about

22
00:02:08,062 --> 00:02:13,044
Guy Gardner and Hawkgirl being revealed in Superman
set photos. We're gonna be talking about the

23
00:02:13,104 --> 00:02:18,405
Batman Ninja vs Yakuza League teaser trailer
and we're gonna be talking about the Kite Man

24
00:02:18,465 --> 00:02:23,427
Hell Yeah official trailer. As always, we list
our segment times in our episode description,

to the No Prize! A No Prize is an award Marvel

47
00:04:22,724 --> 00:04:27,386
used to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic
duel No Prize, is a digital award we post on

48
00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:32,427
Instagram for the person that we feel gave the
best answer to our question of the week. Last

49
00:04:32,487 --> 00:04:37,649
week, we asked you guys, who do you think is
the mysterious man in black in the Superman

50
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:42,315
set photos and why? And this is coming off of
the Superman movie that's currently filming,

51
00:04:42,476 --> 00:04:45,918
and we got a look at a mysterious character
all dressed in black, and thought it would

52
00:04:45,938 --> 00:04:49,841
be fun for you guys to speculate on who it might
be. Yeah, we got quite a few answers. We're

53
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:54,644
going to break down this week's honorable mentions
before revealing the no-prize winner. Our first

54
00:04:54,684 --> 00:05:01,509
honorable mention goes to Alex Albro, who said,
Hey guys, it's Alex. I think the mysterious

55
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:06,872
man in black on the Superman set is really just
the character of Neil Quinn, aka Ulythes, who

56
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:10,802
has some energy transference powers. Something
about the last son of Earth and it's a whole

57
00:05:10,822 --> 00:05:15,405
big metaphor for Superman being the last son
of Krypton and they're gonna fight. And he's

58
00:05:15,445 --> 00:05:20,628
just one of seemingly three enemies Superman's
gonna have to face in this film. Thanks. Bye.

59
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:25,951
Yeah, so Ulysses is a fairly recent character
in the Superman comics. He gets his powers

60
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:31,214
from the fourth dimension and he essentially
has the same powers as Superman. What makes

61
00:05:31,274 --> 00:05:37,417
this answer possible is that he, like the character
that was seen in the set photos, has a U on

62
00:05:37,457 --> 00:05:43,385
his costume. Yeah, and it's a black costume
in the comics too. So this could be it. I don't

63
00:05:43,405 --> 00:05:48,449
know much about the character. I would be kind
of surprised if they were to introduce a character

64
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:54,653
that obscure into the Superman film, but you
never know. The guy is wearing a mask. It could

65
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:59,997
literally be anybody. And this is as good a
guess as any. So great answer, Alex. Our next

66
00:06:00,037 --> 00:06:05,101
honorable mention goes to Buster Barnes. Who
said? Hi guys, Buster Barnes here. Hope you're

67
00:06:05,141 --> 00:06:09,547
doing well. I think the villain in the black
outfit is going to be called Ultraman, however

68
00:06:09,587 --> 00:06:14,129
not the usual iteration that we expect. Instead,
I think it's going to be more like Superman

69
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:19,231
from the Red Sun movie where he is a clone created
by Lex Luthor and or the government in which

70
00:06:19,271 --> 00:06:24,333
he's going to be sent out to take down or potentially
frame Superman. And then he is going to eventually

71
00:06:24,373 --> 00:06:29,736
deteriorate into a bizarro-like villain for
Superman's fight. Take care, guys. Love the

72
00:06:29,756 --> 00:06:34,902
show. Right. So Buster is saying that the U
probably stands for Ultraman. If you've listened

73
00:06:34,922 --> 00:06:41,143
to the podcast a few months ago, we did a duel
episode between Ultraman and Hyperion, so you'll

74
00:06:41,163 --> 00:06:45,665
know all about him. Yeah, and if you've read
the Red Sun miniseries or watched the Red Sun

75
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:50,466
animated movie adaptation, you'll know that
there is a character in that story that's kind

76
00:06:50,486 --> 00:06:55,568
of like an amalgam of Ultraman and Bizarro.
Basically a clone that Lex Luthor created to

77
00:06:55,588 --> 00:07:00,569
go up against the Russian version of Superman.
So of course the speculation is that the masked

78
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:06,487
figure with the U on his chest is an evil version
of Superman, which could make sense because

79
00:07:06,947 --> 00:07:12,448
Lex Luthor is the one who created Superior Man
in the comics, and he also created Bizarro

80
00:07:12,468 --> 00:07:17,550
in the comics as well. And since Lex Luthor
is in the movie, why not have him create an

81
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:23,712
evil Superman clone, who he would call Ultraman?
Great answer Buster, our final honorable mention

82
00:07:23,772 --> 00:07:30,622
goes to Jacob Foster, who said, What if it's
unknown soldier? I mean, He was based back

83
00:07:30,722 --> 00:07:35,466
out in World War II, Creature Commandos were
back in World War II. James Gunn even said

84
00:07:35,506 --> 00:07:41,110
Creature Commandos was the start of the DC,
of his universe at least. Rick Clark Sr. is

85
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:46,894
in Creature Commandos, Rick Clark Sr. is in
Superman. I wanna say that it's a re-adaptation

86
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:53,486
kind of the Unknown Soldier, like just a little
bit of a costume change. The Unknown Soldier

87
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:59,131
is a character in DC Comics who was essentially
a World War II veteran who suffers from amnesia

88
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:04,796
and no longer remembers who he is. He does wear
a full face mask and is a master of disguise.

89
00:08:05,036 --> 00:08:09,420
Of course all of the set photos that we've seen
this mysterious figure in has him associated

90
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,804
with the military, which could mean that yeah,
maybe he's the Unknown Soldier. Just like a

91
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:19,348
modern take on the character. Yeah, I'm not
sure I follow Jacob's line of reasoning that

92
00:08:19,368 --> 00:08:24,971
just because Rick Flagg is in the creature commandos
and this movie. That means that this guy could

93
00:08:24,991 --> 00:08:29,212
be unknown soldier because he was also in World
War two with the creature commandos. But why

94
00:08:29,252 --> 00:08:34,093
not? Sure. It could all work out that way. We
want to give a quick shout out to Brandon Estregard

95
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:38,774
and Daniel Alonso, who also called in with their
answers. Thank you guys so much for taking

96
00:08:38,814 --> 00:08:43,976
the time to do that. Daniel, your suggestion
that it was Night Monkey is, I think, spot

97
00:08:44,116 --> 00:08:52,326
on. But the winner of this week's no prize is
Hey what's up guys it's Miggy and I think the

98
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:59,510
guy in the stuff photos isn't Ultraman or Ulysses
like people are thinking because it's kind

99
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:05,694
of weird to have another reverse Superman and
Gunn has said that it's not a big spoiler that

100
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:11,337
he's been filming out in public so I think it's
an Ultramarine core, a super obscure character

101
00:09:11,397 --> 00:09:16,500
just another like military henchman type. Also
pretty excited about the terrifics in the first

102
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:22,118
look of Hawkgirl and Guy Gardner. Thanks guys.
So the Ultramarine Corps was actually a super

103
00:09:22,158 --> 00:09:28,641
team, not a specific character within DC Comics
that was put together by General Wade Eiling.

104
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:34,863
Although I think Miggy's suggesting that instead
of being a ragtag team of C-list characters,

105
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:39,944
the Ultramarine Corps could be just generic
super soldier types. And this figure dressed

106
00:09:39,964 --> 00:09:43,926
in black is just one of those. Yeah, I could
totally see that being the case. I don't think

107
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:48,990
the figure needs to be some superpowered individuel.
I just think it needs to be an elite soldier

108
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:54,175
of sorts that maybe in this film was not put
together by Wade Eiland, but maybe by Lois

109
00:09:54,195 --> 00:09:59,459
Lane's father, Sam Lane in conjunction with
Lex Corp or something like that. Yeah, yeah,

110
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,163
it's possible. I don't think it's anyone special
when it comes down to it. I don't really want

111
00:10:04,223 --> 00:10:08,987
it to be any kind of Superman knockoff character
because I really want to focus on Lex Luther

112
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:13,476
as the villain. And that's why Miggie gets the
win. So great answer, Miggy, you win this week's

113
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:18,001
No Prize. If you the listener want a shot at
winning your own No Prize, stay tuned to later

114
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:22,767
on in this episode when we will be asking another
Question of the Week. And now that that's done,

115
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:24,209
onto the news.

116
00:10:29,678 --> 00:10:36,063
Okay, so these past two weeks we have been fortunate
enough to receive a ton of set photos from

117
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:41,828
the outdoor filming of the upcoming Superman
film directed by James Gunn. In our last episode

118
00:10:41,848 --> 00:10:47,672
we talked about the first look of the full suits
for Superman and Mr. Terrific. This week we

119
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:52,717
got our first looks at the suits for Guy Gardner,
the Green Lantern played by Nathan Fillion

120
00:10:52,997 --> 00:10:58,541
and Hawk Girl played by Isabella Merced. Now
right off the bat, pretty much everyone noticed

121
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:05,162
that both Hawkeye Girl and Guy Garner were wearing
uniforms very similar to that worn by Mr. Terrific.

122
00:11:05,302 --> 00:11:10,406
And it looks like these are uniforms worn by
a super team sponsored by Maxwell Lord and

123
00:11:10,446 --> 00:11:16,270
his business known as Lord Tech. Which is really
interesting. It definitely leans more towards

124
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:21,414
like a Justice League international team from
the comics, which was sponsored by Maxwell

125
00:11:21,454 --> 00:11:25,056
Lord. Now, I don't know if they're going to
be referred to as the Justice League in this

126
00:11:25,096 --> 00:11:31,075
film or maybe the Terrifics. which was a team
from the comic books led by Mr. Terrific. But

127
00:11:31,295 --> 00:11:35,997
I do think it's interesting that they're going
this sort of corporate sponsored route. Well,

128
00:11:36,037 --> 00:11:41,179
it provides a nice contrast for the type of
hero that Superman is. You know, Superman being

129
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,162
a guy who does what's right for the sake of
what's good and right. Right, yeah, he has

130
00:11:46,182 --> 00:11:51,904
a sense of duty as compared to a corporate sponsored
team, which may be doing it maybe somewhat

131
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:56,538
for the duty, but also maybe for, you know,
the money and perks. Now a lot of people are

132
00:11:56,578 --> 00:12:01,842
dishing out a lot of flack for these outfits
considering the fact that they're not entirely

133
00:12:01,902 --> 00:12:06,705
comics accurate. Guy Garner definitely doesn't
have a lot of green on his costume and Hawkgirl

134
00:12:06,985 --> 00:12:11,909
traditionally wears armor. Yeah, the CW did
it better for her costume, gotta say. Maybe.

135
00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:17,153
I do like her helmet. And Guy Garner's, you
know, bowl cut is definitely in keeping with

136
00:12:17,193 --> 00:12:22,396
the ridiculousness of the character's look in
the comics. And while I do wish that both he

137
00:12:22,497 --> 00:12:28,255
and Hawkgirl were... more comics accurate in
regards to their looks. I also don't hate the

138
00:12:28,315 --> 00:12:34,937
idea story wise of a team that wears the same
uniform, almost sort of like the X-Men in the

139
00:12:34,997 --> 00:12:39,758
first X-Men movie, how they wore all black leather.
This at least is a little bit more colorful

140
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:45,120
and it still has like their brand logo insignias
on their uniforms. I mean, story reasoning

141
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,081
aside, I think the costume choices here were
made to the detriment of character recognition.

142
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:54,569
I mean, this is the first look that we're ever
going to get at the Green Lantern core within

143
00:12:54,629 --> 00:13:00,294
James Gunn's new DCU. And I don't think it quite
services Green Lantern well enough. Same thing

144
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:04,517
with Hawk Girl. I think you're going to run
into like a brand issue at that point almost,

145
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:08,901
because most people are going to associate the
characters within this new universe with this

146
00:13:08,961 --> 00:13:14,566
new look. Well, I mean, in regards to Guy Gardner's
look specifically, he wears a jacket in the

147
00:13:14,606 --> 00:13:19,598
comics. So I think, you know, just a color swap
on his pants and the jacket. would make him

148
00:13:19,658 --> 00:13:26,781
fit right into the upcoming Lantern show. If
all of them wore leather uniforms, I also wouldn't

149
00:13:26,821 --> 00:13:31,523
hate that. It's kind of like Guardians of the
Galaxy, like the Nova Corps in a way. I don't

150
00:13:31,543 --> 00:13:37,025
think they need to be CG energy costumes like
they were in the Ryan Reynolds film. You mentioned

151
00:13:37,045 --> 00:13:41,947
the X-Men earlier. I think that's a fair comparison.
And we've seen what happens when you don't

152
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,748
put the characters in the proper costumes right
away. And sometimes you have to wait 20 plus

153
00:13:45,768 --> 00:13:51,270
years to finally see them in their comics accurate
outfit. Oh, you mean like Wolverine? Yeah.

154
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:57,012
Yeah, you know, that's a fair criticism. But
I also think that if this team is going up

155
00:13:57,052 --> 00:14:02,353
against Superman in this movie, the team is
probably going to disband by the end of it.

156
00:14:02,573 --> 00:14:07,074
And I think it's probably fair that they'll
probably have more comics accurate looks the

157
00:14:07,094 --> 00:14:11,536
next time we see them on screen. That's just
wishful thinking. Yeah. Of course, the one

158
00:14:11,576 --> 00:14:15,637
character that we know is in this film that
has not been seen in the set photos, who is

159
00:14:15,697 --> 00:14:20,978
also a member of the terrific in the comics.
is Metamorpho, who we know is going to be played

160
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:26,920
by Anthony Carrigan. There was a guy in a blue
motion capture suit spotted on set, so that

161
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:31,941
may have been him. He might be an all CGI character,
which would make sense for the character, since,

162
00:14:32,021 --> 00:14:36,062
you know, he's made up of gases and minerals
and stuff like that. I don't know if that's

163
00:14:36,102 --> 00:14:40,704
a motion capture suit or just like a blue screen
suit to make the character invisible later

164
00:14:40,844 --> 00:14:45,925
on. It could be a reference point. I have no
idea how special effects work, but of all of

165
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:51,123
the characters to not be in uniform. he kind
of makes the most sense. But yeah, that's really

166
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:55,686
it. I thought the looks were pretty interesting
and I can't wait to see more official looks,

167
00:14:55,806 --> 00:15:00,248
maybe something that includes Hawker Girls wings
around Comic-Con, I imagine, which is just

168
00:15:00,288 --> 00:15:07,072
in a few weeks. In other DC news, we got our
first 30 second teaser trailer for the sequel

169
00:15:07,112 --> 00:15:12,395
to the animated film, Batman Ninja. This time
it's called Batman Ninja versus Yakuza League,

170
00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:17,550
which looks like it's gonna be Jessica Cruz,
the Green Lantern, the Flash, Aquaman, and

171
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:23,175
Wonder Woman so far. I would be really surprised
if Superman didn't make his way in there somehow.

172
00:15:23,695 --> 00:15:28,600
But so far from what we've seen of these Justice
League characters in these feudal Japanese

173
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,424
designs, I cannot wait for this movie because
it looks like it's gonna be really fun to watch.

174
00:15:33,965 --> 00:15:38,228
Yeah, well, part of the appeal of the first
Batman Ninja movie was to see a bunch of Batman's

175
00:15:38,369 --> 00:15:43,391
rogues gallery. reinterpreted in these feudal
Japanese designs. And it's cool to see that

176
00:15:43,431 --> 00:15:47,652
carried over to the Justice League for this
film. It appears that maybe Batman's actions

177
00:15:47,772 --> 00:15:52,853
in the past influenced present day Japan because
it looks like this movie is taking place in

178
00:15:52,933 --> 00:15:58,215
modern Tokyo, although with a very heavy feudal
Japanese approach. Yeah, which is kind of awesome.

179
00:15:58,515 --> 00:16:03,996
I think that's a really cool setting and approach
to a sequel. I love the looks for Green Lantern,

180
00:16:04,076 --> 00:16:08,377
Aquaman and Wonder Woman. I think they look
really cool. The one I don't love though is

181
00:16:08,397 --> 00:16:12,392
the flash. The hat just doesn't make sense to
me. You know, if you're running, the thing's

182
00:16:12,452 --> 00:16:18,277
gonna fly off. But I'm really curious to see
Superman and any other Justice Leagueers that

183
00:16:18,317 --> 00:16:22,981
make an appearance. It does look like Damien
Wayne is going to be his sidekick for this

184
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:27,785
movie as Robin, and he was in the first movie
as well. Although I do miss the lone wolf and

185
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:33,630
cub inspired haircut for him. Well, it's present
day Japan now, so you gotta modernize it. That's

186
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:38,311
fair. Another thing I love the design of is
the logo for this film. It's the word ninja

187
00:16:38,511 --> 00:16:44,213
and the shape of the Batman logo. I want to
get that tattooed on my face. I'm wondering

188
00:16:44,233 --> 00:16:48,394
though, since Batman's going up against the
Yakuza League, does that mean that the Justice

189
00:16:48,434 --> 00:16:54,055
League are evil? Yeah, I think that's a fair
assumption here. They're organized crime. And

190
00:16:54,075 --> 00:16:57,736
they're going to be turned good by the end,
maybe? It's weird to see the characters as

191
00:16:57,776 --> 00:17:03,443
villains. That's a good question. Yeah, maybe
he has to go back in time. to fix whatever

192
00:17:03,543 --> 00:17:10,628
got messed up in the past and the league follows
him. I have no idea. We don't have a release

193
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:15,152
date for this film just yet. We just know that
it's coming out soon and I can't wait to learn

194
00:17:15,212 --> 00:17:19,776
more about it. Again, hopefully during Comic-Con.
I expect all of my answers to all of my questions

195
00:17:19,816 --> 00:17:26,441
to be revealed at Comic-Con. That never happens.
I know. I just realized now that I'm visiting

196
00:17:26,521 --> 00:17:31,665
the official Batman Ninja website. You know
what they're going for with the Flash's hat?

197
00:17:31,982 --> 00:17:38,068
They're going for a Jay Garrick's helmet homage.
Oh, OK. I see. I was thinking Raiden for some

198
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:41,372
reason. I don't know what the lightning. No,
because the hat definitely has wings on it.

199
00:17:41,632 --> 00:17:45,897
You know, got you. Makes sense. I loved the
first movie. I can't wait for this movie. I

200
00:17:45,937 --> 00:17:49,041
love the concept. And that brings us to our
question of the week.

201
00:17:53,590 --> 00:18:00,655
What other Marvel or DC character would you
like to see get a cultural reimagining for

202
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:06,099
a one-off special? Right, similar to Spider-Man
India or like, I don't know, the upcoming Aztec

203
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:11,564
Batman, things like that. What culture, what
hero? Describe your reimagining. Record your

before July 13th. In our final bit of DC news,

209
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:41,523
we got an official trailer for the upcoming
Kite Man Hell Yeah animated series. Of course,

210
00:18:41,563 --> 00:18:47,365
this is a spin off of the Harley Quinn animated
series, and a lot of characters are seemingly

211
00:18:47,405 --> 00:18:53,368
making a return. for this one. Which makes me
wonder why this couldn't just be a subplot

212
00:18:53,448 --> 00:18:58,710
for the upcoming season of Harley Quinn, but
I hope it's just as funny as the Harley Quinn

213
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:03,052
show. I mean, this is the series that no one
asked for, right? No one asked for a Kite Man

214
00:19:03,092 --> 00:19:06,893
series. I don't know what they're doing. I know
that we have to review this, but I'll say that

215
00:19:06,933 --> 00:19:11,215
I'm not looking forward to it despite the fact
that yeah, Harley Quinn is hilarious, Kite

216
00:19:11,235 --> 00:19:15,177
Man the character is hilarious. I just think
there's no demand and nobody's gonna really

217
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:19,866
watch this in my opinion. Dude, no one asked
for Kite Man as a character to exist in the

218
00:19:19,886 --> 00:19:25,988
comics to begin with. You're right, this should
not exist in any shape or form, but it does

219
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:29,209
and I'm kind of here for it. Because it looks
like they're really, you know, gonna bring

220
00:19:29,269 --> 00:19:34,310
out the lovable loser trope that is Kite Man.
It looks like he has really horrible luck,

221
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:39,352
his dad hates him, he's trying to run a bar
with his new girlfriend, Golden Glider, who's

222
00:19:39,392 --> 00:19:44,633
just killing everybody. I guess the concept
does lend itself to a situational comedy sitcom

223
00:19:44,673 --> 00:19:50,107
of sorts. I don't want to sound like a hater
because you look at a show like Modok, which

224
00:19:50,227 --> 00:19:54,608
also nobody asks for, but I truly loved that
show. So I'm hoping for something like that,

225
00:19:54,708 --> 00:20:00,410
I guess. I do hope that this show is much more
episodic than Harley Quinn. Let that have an

226
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:05,571
overarching narrative throughout the season,
but let this one be more like Cheers. I think

227
00:20:05,591 --> 00:20:11,413
that would be perfect. Absolutely. Yeah. The
show is being released on July 18th. I'm hoping

228
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:15,776
that we could squeeze in a Kite Man duel around
that time. The executive producers were kicking

229
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:20,864
around the idea of pitting Stiltman against
Kiteman, which I think is so perfect. Hopefully

230
00:20:20,904 --> 00:20:24,891
we can get that in. Yeah, that'll be a lot of
fun. Once I heard the idea, I can't un-hear

231
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:26,433
it, and it definitely needs to happen.

232
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:38,619
So that's it for all the news this week, now
let's move on to the main event, where we review

233
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,649
the 2009 animated film Green Lantern First Flight.

234
00:20:59,402 --> 00:21:06,223
Green Lantern First Flight is a standalone animated
direct-to-video film released in 2009. It was

235
00:21:06,263 --> 00:21:11,965
directed by Lauren Montgomery, a former storyboard
artist for the Justice League Unlimited animated

236
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:17,967
series, who went on to direct some of DC's most
celebrated animated films, including Wonder

237
00:21:17,987 --> 00:21:24,688
Woman, Batman Year One, Superman Doomsday, Justice
League Doom, just to name a few. She's also

238
00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:30,431
worked on projects for Marvel and Nickelodeon's
Avatar franchise, Basically, she's a badass

239
00:21:30,511 --> 00:21:35,155
in the animation industry, so it should come
as no surprise that one of Green Lantern's

240
00:21:35,215 --> 00:21:41,760
most badass films, live action or otherwise,
would be one she directed. Namely, this movie.

241
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,944
Now since the movie is a decade and a half old
by this point, I'm guessing if you wanted to

242
00:21:46,964 --> 00:21:52,168
see the movie by now, you would have. But here's
your warning that if you want to avoid spoilers,

243
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:57,673
I'd probably skip this review until you see
the film, which has awesome action, a stellar

244
00:21:57,693 --> 00:22:03,910
voice cast, and really is a film made for fans
of the source material. Now, First Flight was

245
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:10,155
released two years before the live action Green
Lantern film that starred Ryan Reynolds, and

246
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:15,680
it's a shame they didn't take more inspiration
from this film because while it admittedly

247
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:21,785
isn't the best origin story when it comes to
Hell Jordan, it does a surprisingly decent

248
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:27,649
job at explaining the cosmic lore behind the
Green Lantern stories and a phenomenal job.

249
00:22:27,978 --> 00:22:34,200
with its villain. Sinestro in this film is hands
down the best villain in any Green Lantern

250
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,782
film to date, of which there aren't many, but
yeah, this film set the standard right out

251
00:22:38,822 --> 00:22:44,565
the gate with its corrupt law enforcer mentoring
the rookie training day-esque approach to the

252
00:22:44,625 --> 00:22:49,707
story. Yeah, one of the best things that this
movie did with the origin was make it primarily

253
00:22:49,747 --> 00:22:55,689
in space. The 2011 live action Green Lantern
movie had its main conflict back on Earth.

254
00:22:55,990 --> 00:23:01,594
But I think the unique thing about Green Lantern
is that he's one of DC's few cosmic heroes.

255
00:23:01,754 --> 00:23:07,097
You know, you have the core, you have the new
gods and a handful of others. But unlike Marvel's

256
00:23:07,117 --> 00:23:12,461
cosmic side, DC doesn't have a whole lot of
popular franchises set in outer space. That's

257
00:23:12,741 --> 00:23:16,844
fair. Now, I would definitely agree with you
that the decision to keep the film in outer

258
00:23:16,924 --> 00:23:22,869
space kind of helped the narrative in that you
were learning about the universe along with

259
00:23:22,949 --> 00:23:28,711
the main character. as opposed to him being
on Earth and aliens having to learn about us.

260
00:23:28,831 --> 00:23:33,612
It was kind of backwards for the way I think
a Green Lantern film should be. As I mentioned,

261
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:38,554
the film isn't a great origin story for its
main character, Halt Jordan, who's very much

262
00:23:38,594 --> 00:23:44,415
along for the ride and very reactionary in the
film, in much the same way Ethan Hawke's character

263
00:23:44,475 --> 00:23:51,057
was in Training Day. And for some reason, that
works. The rookie thrown into the deep end

264
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:56,636
framing of the story helps, I think, with all
of the lore and exposition that's thrown at

265
00:23:56,676 --> 00:24:03,840
the audience. The film wastes no time, like
zero. Hal Jordan is literally wearing the Green

266
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:09,343
Lantern suit less than four minutes into the
film. It doesn't bother explaining Hal Jordan's

267
00:24:09,383 --> 00:24:16,187
history or relationship or goals. We don't know
why he was chosen to wear the ring. The Earth

268
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:22,142
scenes are just prologue, essentially, to the
story's massive stakes. of who will control

269
00:24:22,202 --> 00:24:28,366
the dominant power in the universe. The thing
is though, that the film is only 77 minutes

270
00:24:28,446 --> 00:24:35,169
long, almost 15 minutes shy of a standard 90
minute film. Like 90 minutes is the minimum

271
00:24:35,229 --> 00:24:40,372
length a film should be. And there was a lot
of backstory for Hell that they could have

272
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:45,435
squeezed into that remaining time. So that kind
of sucks, and it really makes it seem like

273
00:24:45,595 --> 00:24:51,418
they knew the audience watching this film would
be fans of the comics and not- need all of

274
00:24:51,438 --> 00:24:58,063
that extra information maybe? Though I'd argue
that's probably a lazy and dangerous approach

275
00:24:58,323 --> 00:25:03,747
and it shows in this film's current Rotten Tomatoes
scores as the audience score is fresh while

276
00:25:03,767 --> 00:25:08,971
the critics score is rotten. Though who knows
with my review that may change. Yeah the movie

277
00:25:08,991 --> 00:25:13,554
definitely does no favors for newcomers to the
franchise. You had mentioned that it seems

278
00:25:13,674 --> 00:25:18,135
the filmmakers here knew that their audience
would be fans of the character most likely,

279
00:25:18,415 --> 00:25:23,117
but it also seems more like an admission that
casual viewers aren't going to watch their

280
00:25:23,157 --> 00:25:27,618
film. Yeah. Which is not a good thing. You know,
especially for an origin story, you want things

281
00:25:27,658 --> 00:25:32,059
to be accessible. Yeah, absolutely. And you
know, there are a lot of comics characters

282
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:38,761
with really dense lores, but a good writer can
fix that in a way, because not everything needs

283
00:25:38,801 --> 00:25:45,380
to be adapted. one for one from comics to the
screen because you have decades worth of history

284
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,801
to back you up in the comics, whereas you don't
have that when you're trying to reach an audience

285
00:25:49,821 --> 00:25:55,004
for the first time. I could have easily done
with a good 15 minutes or more of this film

286
00:25:55,204 --> 00:26:00,086
because I did enjoy it. The current runtime,
I think signifies there was a budget issue

287
00:26:00,206 --> 00:26:03,987
and maybe that's why they couldn't squeeze in
more of that pertinent character building.

288
00:26:04,387 --> 00:26:08,649
Yeah, I was guessing the same thing. They probably
didn't have the money to do more story, which

289
00:26:08,689 --> 00:26:13,496
is a shame. Now, I will admit that one of the
reasons the film does a decent job with the

290
00:26:13,536 --> 00:26:19,580
Green Lantern lore is because it wisely chose
to ignore comic writer Jeff Johns' introduction

291
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:25,945
of the emotional electromagnetic spectrum and
the embodiments of the emotions within it such

292
00:26:26,005 --> 00:26:31,929
as the entity of Parallax, who we were introduced
to in the Green Lantern Rebirth comic storyline

293
00:26:31,949 --> 00:26:37,733
a few years prior. Parallax, of course, was
the villain in the live-action film and rewatching

294
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:43,913
this film All I could think about was how much
of a mistake that was. Yeah. Can I say my favorite

295
00:26:43,953 --> 00:26:48,717
thing about this movie is the lack of emotional
spectrum. When you start talking about colors

296
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:55,041
as emotions, it all becomes just a little bit
too conceptual and maybe cheesy. I like their

297
00:26:55,062 --> 00:26:58,944
approach of just saying this is the green energy
that they were able to harness from the green

298
00:26:59,004 --> 00:27:03,568
element and it's weak to the yellow element.
And that's really all you need to know. I completely

299
00:27:03,628 --> 00:27:09,523
agree. It's way too. convoluted. Even in the
comics, it's too much in my opinion. Yeah,

300
00:27:09,943 --> 00:27:15,004
I mean it makes everything just too emotional,
which sounds like a shitty thing to say because

301
00:27:15,124 --> 00:27:20,286
it's not a bad thing to be emotional, but you
really paint your characters into a corner

302
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:24,527
and it's hard for them to be multifaceted and
have multiple emotions when you know they're

303
00:27:24,547 --> 00:27:29,728
represented by things like anger for the red
lanterns or avarice for the orange lanterns,

304
00:27:30,128 --> 00:27:35,054
fear for the yellow lanterns. Everything is
just kind of pigeonholed character-wise. Yeah,

305
00:27:35,074 --> 00:27:39,355
it makes the characters more one-dimensional.
I completely agree with you. Going back to

306
00:27:39,375 --> 00:27:44,116
Hal Jordan's lack of character development,
the main reason I think it's easy to gloss

307
00:27:44,376 --> 00:27:50,838
over that is the action. I think the animated
action of this film is actually its main draw,

308
00:27:51,078 --> 00:27:56,479
and anticipating what ingenious way Hal Jordan
was going to use his ring's power to get out

309
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,941
of various conflicts was really fun to watch,
like in a MacGyver kind of way. With all the

310
00:28:02,001 --> 00:28:07,164
prejudice the alien characters had, for the
human Hal Jordan, it was satisfying to see

311
00:28:07,184 --> 00:28:12,308
him outthink them in a way that it never really
was for the live action film, at least for

312
00:28:12,348 --> 00:28:16,612
me personally. Yeah, I mean Green Lantern's
power set is so visual, it's always fun to

313
00:28:16,632 --> 00:28:21,556
watch. Absolutely. The guy can literally create
anything, so what is he going to create next?

314
00:28:21,636 --> 00:28:26,219
Let's find out. I mean, there is a severe lack
of imagination among the Green Lantern Corps

315
00:28:26,239 --> 00:28:31,704
in general. They kind of seem to keep their
constructs limited to the six simple machines,

316
00:28:32,204 --> 00:28:36,874
but it's still fun to watch that too. In terms
of the animation, I tend to knock the Bruce

317
00:28:36,894 --> 00:28:43,257
Timm style for its overuse, but this is among
the best works in that style I would say, like

318
00:28:43,297 --> 00:28:49,759
hands down. It almost, like almost, edges into
kinetic anime style in moments when characters'

319
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:54,781
body structures become exaggerated, but I wouldn't
go as far as to say this is anywhere close

320
00:28:54,801 --> 00:29:00,195
to being as good as anime animation. Yeah, it's
a step up, I think, from a lot of what we got

321
00:29:00,295 --> 00:29:04,878
in the DC animated movie universe. Even though,
you know, that whole run of films was incredible,

322
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:10,261
the animation was slightly lacking during that
run. Here, it was fantastic. Yeah, of course,

323
00:29:10,301 --> 00:29:15,425
this film was not in that run. It wasn't a part
of that. This, of course, was its own standalone

324
00:29:15,445 --> 00:29:20,968
film. I think even Green Lanterns Emerald Nights
is only considered a quasi sequel, with only

325
00:29:21,048 --> 00:29:26,968
some of the voice cast returning for that movie.
I did mention that the voice cast here is stellar

326
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:33,153
and we see some pretty big names including Michael
Madsen of Reservoir Dogs fame as Killawog,

327
00:29:33,634 --> 00:29:39,799
Kurtwood Smith from That 70s Show as Kanjar
Rowe, and Trisha Helfer from Battlestar Galactica

328
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:45,644
as Budica. They spent way more money on the
casting budget for this film than they have

329
00:29:45,684 --> 00:29:51,188
in recent DC animated fare and that's probably
why they could only reach 77 minutes. But let's

330
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:56,056
talk about the two main characters. and the
actors who voiced them in our character breakdown.

331
00:29:56,517 --> 00:30:01,381
Now Hal Jordan was voiced by Christopher Maloney,
who's most well known for playing Detective

332
00:30:01,421 --> 00:30:07,367
Stabler on Law and Order SVU, but is also a
known face from other films such as 12 Monkeys

333
00:30:07,507 --> 00:30:12,612
and Man of Steel, where he played Colonel Hardy.
I still remember rumors that he was going to

334
00:30:12,632 --> 00:30:16,936
be Hal Jordan when his casting was announced
for Man of Steel way back when, because of

335
00:30:16,976 --> 00:30:22,300
his work in this Green Lantern film. Now, my
favorite voice actor for Hal Jordan is actually

336
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:28,304
Nathan Fillion, but probably only because Maloney
doesn't have a whole lot to work with in this

337
00:30:28,364 --> 00:30:34,248
film. Like I've said, Hal's a very reactionary
character. So a lot of his lines in the movie

338
00:30:34,428 --> 00:30:42,954
are relegated to things like, OK, and what the
hell? It's not the best writing. Yeah, he doesn't

339
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:46,956
get a lot of monologues or anything like that.
Definitely not. The most he speaks is when

340
00:30:46,996 --> 00:30:51,571
he's like talking to the guardians. or when
he's talking to Budoka and Killawag in his

341
00:30:51,651 --> 00:30:57,415
cell. Now regarding Hal's character arc, it's
clear from the opening scene that Hal is something

342
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:02,878
of a troublemaker who's probably too skilled
to test flight simulators and he's pretty bored.

343
00:31:03,298 --> 00:31:07,441
That of course all changes when he gains the
Green Lantern Ring and is whisked off across

344
00:31:07,461 --> 00:31:13,204
the universe on an adventure with universal
stakes. But that's pretty much it. Like he's

345
00:31:13,264 --> 00:31:18,239
kind of the universe's luckiest guy. and that
he often just finds himself in the right place

346
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:24,142
at the right time, whether it's being chosen
for the ring or noticing invisible aliens in

347
00:31:24,162 --> 00:31:29,525
a spaceport or even being near the central power
battery at the end of the film. Yeah, I noticed

348
00:31:29,565 --> 00:31:34,647
that a lot of the plot was driven by Hal just
being lucky. Like, of course, he fell into

349
00:31:34,667 --> 00:31:39,994
the sewer right before the bad guy fell into
the sewer. You know, right? Yeah. I just managed

350
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:45,635
to run into Kush. Yeah, it's again, not an example
of the best writing. You don't want your character

351
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:50,817
to just be lucky. You want there to be reasons
for that, typically. You shouldn't be able

352
00:31:50,837 --> 00:31:56,118
to get away with something like that in screenwriting,
but they kind of did in this film. Yeah, just

353
00:31:56,158 --> 00:32:02,140
barely enough where the audience didn't question
it too much. I do think that this movie probably

354
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:07,361
deserved a sequel and that it set up really
well why Hal Jordan would be regarded as one

355
00:32:07,401 --> 00:32:11,600
of the best among the core. which is always
kind of hard to believe considering how massive

356
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,263
the court is. You know, everyone's always talking
about how great Hal Jordan is. But this movie

357
00:32:16,403 --> 00:32:20,126
showed that, you know, he definitely has something
unique going for him. Yeah, we may not know

358
00:32:20,246 --> 00:32:26,070
why he's special, but the film does a good job
of establishing the fact that he is. I think

359
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:31,193
they definitely could have taken that in different
directions for a sequel. Also special is Sinestro,

360
00:32:31,294 --> 00:32:37,098
who in this film was voiced by Victor Garber,
the Tony and Emmy award winning actor. known

361
00:32:37,118 --> 00:32:43,362
for his work in films like Titanic and Argo
and shows like Alias. He was Martin Stein in

362
00:32:43,402 --> 00:32:49,186
the CW's Arrowverse shows, you know, one half
of Firestorm. The guy's just an amazing actor

363
00:32:49,506 --> 00:32:55,211
and he was great as Sinestro, like flawlessly
capturing the characters cold cunning to boiling

364
00:32:55,291 --> 00:33:01,815
rage. Sinestro is easily the most interesting
character in this film. You know, he's a bad

365
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:06,751
cop who's disdained for chaos and crime in the
universe. which he attributes to a failure

366
00:33:06,811 --> 00:33:12,135
in leadership on behalf of the Guardians, leads
to him abusing his power. He believes it's

367
00:33:12,175 --> 00:33:17,360
better to be feared and respected rather than
being compassionate, and his extreme methods

368
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:24,246
have proven results that garner him influence
within the core. His utilitarian philosophy,

369
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:31,172
that his means are justified by his end goal
of instilling order in the universe, is comparable

370
00:33:31,232 --> 00:33:37,432
to other villains like Thanos, or Ozymandias
from Watchmen. It's wrong, but it's easy to

371
00:33:37,472 --> 00:33:43,937
see how good intentions could lead there. And
the crazy thing is that if it wasn't for one

372
00:33:43,997 --> 00:33:50,662
guy from one backwater planet, he would have
been successful. Like he killed so many good

373
00:33:50,702 --> 00:33:56,438
guys in this film, more than a lot of other
villains in a lot of other movies. Like you

374
00:33:56,478 --> 00:34:01,642
mentioned, I would have loved to have seen a
direct sequel to this film where Sinestro goes

375
00:34:01,722 --> 00:34:08,027
on to create the Sinestro Corps. That sequel
will never happen, but I hope that Sinestro

376
00:34:08,248 --> 00:34:14,253
is as good in the upcoming Lanterns television
series as he was in this film. For sure. Yeah,

377
00:34:14,293 --> 00:34:18,096
he was fantastic in this movie. I was blown
away. His motivations were so clear. You could

378
00:34:18,136 --> 00:34:22,339
totally see where he was coming from, where
he truly believed that any action he took,

379
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:28,119
no matter how seemingly immoral or evil. were
rationalized by the fact that he likely would

380
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:33,481
produce results. But as Hal Jordan shows, there
are multiple ways to achieve order in the universe,

381
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:39,343
and not all of them mean you have to be a dick.
Or specifically a dictator, you know? Right.

382
00:34:39,363 --> 00:34:44,866
Which is exactly what Sinestro wanted to be,
and he wanted to amass power to essentially

383
00:34:44,946 --> 00:34:50,288
control everyone and everything in the universe,
taking away their freedoms. And that's sort

384
00:34:50,328 --> 00:34:54,974
of what sets him apart from someone like Thanos
or Ozymandias. They weren't really trying to

385
00:34:55,034 --> 00:34:59,958
control people in the same way that Sinestro
is, and I think that makes him a little bit

386
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:05,862
even more sinister, perhaps. For sure. I was
actually surprised by the body count in this

387
00:35:05,922 --> 00:35:11,526
movie. Like, so many dead green lanterns. The
stakes were massive, and the movie definitely

388
00:35:11,566 --> 00:35:16,309
didn't shy away from showing us that. Yeah,
no. Like, we saw some popular lanterns go down,

389
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:22,493
like Tomar Ray, Boudicca, Green Man. Too many.
Too many. Oh, I didn't know Charlie Day was

390
00:35:22,533 --> 00:35:24,123
in this movie. What?

399
00:36:18,611 --> 00:36:24,314
Moving on to the story highlights, during an
exercise in a flight simulator for aeronautics

400
00:36:24,334 --> 00:36:30,719
company Ferris Air, Hell Jordan is abducted
by the dying alien Aben Suur, a protector of

401
00:36:30,739 --> 00:36:35,962
the universe known as a Green Lantern, whose
spacecraft crash landed in the American desert.

402
00:36:36,483 --> 00:36:42,467
His power ring chooses Hell to be Aben's successor,
and after donning the ring, the spacecraft

403
00:36:42,527 --> 00:36:48,696
explodes, destroying any evidence of it or the
alien. Like you said, lightning quick. The

404
00:36:48,756 --> 00:36:53,483
origin happened so fast in this movie, I was
actually kind of confused that I maybe skipped

405
00:36:53,543 --> 00:36:58,870
over some important establishing scene or something.
Yeah, actually I thought the same thing. It's

406
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:03,016
been a while since I'd last seen this film.
So yeah, I rewound it and watched it a couple

407
00:37:03,056 --> 00:37:08,515
of times actually. Now, one thing they did in
this film that was brilliant was have the spacecraft

408
00:37:08,735 --> 00:37:13,897
explode and destroy the alien body, destroying
all evidence, essentially, because then you

409
00:37:13,917 --> 00:37:18,139
don't even need to worry about that. Like what
they did in the Green Lantern live action film.

410
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:22,461
It's like, oh, all of a sudden we have this
alien cadaver that we need to, you know, run

411
00:37:22,501 --> 00:37:26,963
tests on and stuff like that. Get that out of
the way. Get into space. Does that mean the

412
00:37:27,023 --> 00:37:30,844
Evans or ship had some kind of self-destruct
sequence built into it or something like that?

413
00:37:30,904 --> 00:37:37,449
I guess I don't even know why the ship exploded.
Oh, yeah, that's fair. The reasoning is because

414
00:37:37,469 --> 00:37:44,295
we need to move the story along. All right.
We need to get to the opening credits. That

415
00:37:44,315 --> 00:37:48,899
doesn't seem very efficient in terms of Green
Lantern detective work when one of the core

416
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:53,222
members goes down. You would think that the
ring itself would at least serve as a black

417
00:37:53,262 --> 00:37:58,787
box sort of log for that type of situation,
but seems that's not the case. Oh, that's true.

418
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:03,894
I didn't even think about that. It should. It
probably would in the comics, but I guess not

419
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:08,957
for this film. Now after returning the simulator
back to Ferris Air Base, Hal Jordan informs

420
00:38:08,997 --> 00:38:14,779
his love interest and supervisor, Carol Ferris,
that he'll be taking a week off of work, just

421
00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:20,081
before he's ambushed and interrogated by four
other alien members of the Green Lantern Corps,

422
00:38:20,541 --> 00:38:25,603
who questioned what happened to Abbasur and
inform Hal that they'll be taking him to their

423
00:38:25,663 --> 00:38:31,562
homeworld, Oa, at the center of the universe,
for approval from their superiors. beings known

424
00:38:31,702 --> 00:38:37,186
as the Guardians. The Guardians initially express
disdain at the idea of an Earthling bearing

425
00:38:37,266 --> 00:38:43,170
a Green Lantern power ring, but after Hal stands
up for himself against the Guardians, a senior

426
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:48,855
Green Lantern named Sinestro offers to train
and test Hal to see if he's worthy of the ring.

427
00:38:49,215 --> 00:38:53,738
Sinestro takes Hal to the central power battery
that energizes their rings so that Hal can

428
00:38:53,778 --> 00:39:00,583
download all of the known information of Universal
Sector 1215. a process that Hal surprisingly

429
00:39:00,623 --> 00:39:07,506
survives. The two travel to Kadmindo, a planet
within Sector 1215, where Sinestro believes

430
00:39:07,526 --> 00:39:13,990
they can find Kutch. The alien Sinestro believes
is responsible for Abin Sur's death. When Sinestro

431
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:20,153
tortures Kutch's love interest, Labela, for
information, Hal tries to stop him just before

432
00:39:20,213 --> 00:39:23,235
Kutch attacks the Green Lanterns, then attempts
to flee.

433
00:39:28,598 --> 00:39:34,400
but upon delivering him to Sinestro, HAL has
physically reprimanded for his earlier defiance,

434
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:39,862
learning of Sinestro's uncompromising disdain
for the crime and chaos in the universe, and

435
00:39:39,882 --> 00:39:45,084
that the Guardians have been inadequate in preventing.
Other Green Lanterns arrive, and they take

436
00:39:45,184 --> 00:39:50,907
Kutch back to Oa for interrogation. Another
thing that the script kind of skips over is

437
00:39:51,087 --> 00:39:56,389
why Kutch was a lead for the Corps. They mention
his name kind of out of the blue, and all of

438
00:39:56,409 --> 00:40:01,639
a sudden we're following this guy. Well, somehow
Sinestro knew that Kutch was the one who killed

439
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:07,723
Abin Sur. We never learned how he learned that
information, but possibly he learned it from

440
00:40:07,803 --> 00:40:13,546
Kanjar Rowe, which begs the question, why didn't
a Sinestro just go straight to Kanjar Rowe?

441
00:40:13,926 --> 00:40:17,408
That's a great question. And you would think
that maybe Hal Jordan would have questions

442
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:21,791
about what they were doing and why. Possibly.
You know, Hal Jordan is not a detective on

443
00:40:21,931 --> 00:40:26,333
Earth, so maybe he wouldn't have thought of
that. That's the only explanation I could think

444
00:40:26,433 --> 00:40:33,670
of. The moon ball scene where Sinestro was torturing
Labella was hard to watch, I found. Yeah, because

445
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:40,195
of the context that this moon ball was a drug.
So the analog to Earthbound Drugs was like

446
00:40:40,375 --> 00:40:46,139
watching him make her inject herself with heroin
repeatedly or something like that. Right. Yeah,

447
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:51,062
that's crazy. This is actually the scene that
made me think of Training Day specifically,

448
00:40:51,423 --> 00:40:55,325
you know, just the whole drug tie in. And I
was like, oh man, this is kind of brilliant.

449
00:40:55,445 --> 00:41:01,307
Yeah. Now on Oa, Hal is befriended by Budica
despite his discrimination from other lanterns.

450
00:41:01,787 --> 00:41:06,608
Budica explains the history of the Green Lantern
Corps and how it's currently being threatened

451
00:41:06,648 --> 00:41:12,630
by the emergence of the Yellow Element, an energy
source recently stolen by an alien smuggler

452
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:18,972
named Kanjar Rho that rivals the Green Element
within the Central Power Battery. Kutch, Hal

453
00:41:19,012 --> 00:41:24,713
learns, fatally wounded Abin Sur when Abin Sur
went undercover to find the Yellow Element.

454
00:41:25,058 --> 00:41:30,739
just before Abin crash landed on Earth. After
torturing and killing Kutch for information,

455
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:36,541
Sinestro debriefs the core as to Kanjar Rose
whereabouts in preparation for a mission to

456
00:41:36,641 --> 00:41:42,343
get him, just before being scolded by the Guardians
for his extreme measures. The scene between

457
00:41:42,383 --> 00:41:48,025
Budica and Hal is actually pretty crucial I
would say for the movie because there's a lot

458
00:41:48,065 --> 00:41:54,491
of exposition there. and they do it in a pretty
efficient way through essentially a mind reading

459
00:41:54,551 --> 00:41:59,172
of each other. Yeah, it was the exchange of
information through the rings, which is a pretty

460
00:41:59,192 --> 00:42:04,934
cool concept. This used so much foreshadow how
Sinistra uses his own ring to read the dying

461
00:42:04,994 --> 00:42:09,455
mind of Kenjaro later in the film. Yeah, but
it doesn't explain how he was able to reanimate

462
00:42:09,495 --> 00:42:14,196
Kenjaro's body. Like, I didn't know the Green
Lantern ring could bring back the dead. Well,

463
00:42:14,216 --> 00:42:19,374
he was saying that he was reconnecting his dead
synapses in his brain. Something like that.

464
00:42:19,394 --> 00:42:26,880
That's bullshit. It's bullshit. I agree. When
a team of lanterns arrive at the Cadian space

465
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:33,325
terminal to find Kanjaro, Hel is assigned to
watch the outer perimeter. Kanjaro, meanwhile,

466
00:42:33,546 --> 00:42:38,670
learns the lanterns are looking for him and
meets with Sinestro telepathically, revealing

467
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:43,734
that the two are secretly working together to
turn the yellow element into a weapon. Though

468
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:49,218
Sinestro tries to focus the lantern's attention
away from Kanjaro, so that he could escape,

469
00:42:49,578 --> 00:42:55,020
Hal notices suspicious activity on the loading
dock area and discovers Kanjar Rho and his

470
00:42:55,080 --> 00:43:02,123
soldiers. A battle and chase ensue, but thanks
to Hal's ingenuity and competence, he manages

471
00:43:02,163 --> 00:43:08,026
to reach Kanjar before the others, only to be
knocked unconscious. When Sinestro arrives

472
00:43:08,246 --> 00:43:14,408
second, he kills Kanjar knowing Hal would get
the blame. That action scene that happens through

473
00:43:14,428 --> 00:43:19,383
the space warp tunnel is so damn cool. I really
liked how that all played out. It had a lot

474
00:43:19,403 --> 00:43:23,385
of momentum. Yeah, all the action scenes in
this had a lot of momentum and again, a lot

475
00:43:23,405 --> 00:43:28,508
of stakes because you actually see lanterns
fall during the battle. So it's like, oh, shit.

476
00:43:28,928 --> 00:43:33,290
You know, what's going to happen to these characters
that we've kind of come to know. And the way

477
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:38,713
that Held Jordan manages to succeed where the
others don't. Again, one of the highlights

478
00:43:38,753 --> 00:43:44,637
of watching this film, like him using that grapple
to latch onto the spaceship as it emerged from

479
00:43:44,737 --> 00:43:49,127
that wormhole thing. It's like, why didn't the
others think of that? Because that was brilliant.

480
00:43:49,568 --> 00:43:55,111
Exactly. I also really liked the whole plot
of Sinestro framing Hal Jordan for murder.

481
00:43:55,712 --> 00:44:00,094
Again, it's another tie to the Training Day
film. If you guys haven't seen Training Day,

482
00:44:00,214 --> 00:44:05,558
watch that movie. I think that would be a perfect
setup for a Green Lantern film. And I really

483
00:44:05,578 --> 00:44:11,870
hope that's used as inspiration or basis for
the upcoming HBO Max Lantern show. Back on

484
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:17,054
Oa, Hel is put on trial for the death of Kanjar
and stripped of his power rink and placed in

485
00:44:17,114 --> 00:44:23,199
custody for deportation back to Earth. Confiding
in his fellow lanterns Budica and Kilowog that

486
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:29,284
he suspects Sinestro was responsible for killing
Kanjar and stealing his energy rod, they take

487
00:44:29,304 --> 00:44:35,629
a detour to the morgue where Hel's suspicions
are confirmed as they find Sinestro using Kanjar's

488
00:44:35,709 --> 00:44:40,853
energy rod to telepathically deduce that the
yellow element is with the weaponers on the

489
00:44:40,893 --> 00:44:47,423
planet. Quard. When Killawag tries to arrest
Sinestro, Budica reveals herself to be in league

490
00:44:47,443 --> 00:44:54,729
with Sinestro and knocks Killawag out. As Sinestro
leaves Oa for Quard, Budica attempts to kill

491
00:44:54,789 --> 00:45:01,455
Hal only for Killawag to awaken. Hal manages
to outsmart Budica who accidentally kills herself

492
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:06,900
in an explosion from Kandar's energy rod. Budica's
betrayal totally caught me by surprise. I did

493
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:11,539
not see that coming. It was a legitimate twist.
Yeah, and kudos to the animators for making

494
00:45:11,699 --> 00:45:15,863
all of her like previous worrisome glances have
like this double meaning when you watch the

495
00:45:15,883 --> 00:45:20,547
film for the second time. Like she's worried
Hal is catching on, not that she's worried

496
00:45:20,647 --> 00:45:27,372
about Hal in general. Her death scene was hardcore.
It was violent. I was like, what rating is

497
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:33,518
this? Holy shit. Yeah, it's like, why isn't
the blood blue? When Sinistro arrives on cord,

498
00:45:33,618 --> 00:45:38,698
the weaponers reveal that they have made a second
power battery using the yellow element. and

499
00:45:38,758 --> 00:45:44,342
gift him with a yellow ring to control it before
departing back to their home dimension. When

500
00:45:44,402 --> 00:45:50,246
a squad of green lanterns arrive on Kord, having
learned of Sinestro's whereabouts, Sinestro

501
00:45:50,286 --> 00:45:55,970
kills them, sending their rings back to Oa.
Sinestro arrives on Oa soon after with his

502
00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:01,694
power battery and decimates the planet along
with any lantern that tries to stop him. When

503
00:46:01,714 --> 00:46:07,638
the yellow power battery overloads the green
one, lanterns across the universe are with

504
00:46:07,718 --> 00:46:13,783
many of them dying in space. As the Guardians
prepare to surrender to Sinestro, HAL manages

505
00:46:13,823 --> 00:46:18,647
to harness the green element directly while
within the destroyed central power battery.

506
00:46:19,047 --> 00:46:24,852
Full of green energy, HAL battles Sinestro,
managing to destroy the yellow power battery

507
00:46:25,132 --> 00:46:31,378
with two moons of Oa in the process. Using up
the last of his energy to blast Sinestro to

508
00:46:31,418 --> 00:46:33,299
the surface of Oa from space,

509
00:46:36,374 --> 00:46:42,336
destroy Sinestro's reign before flying up to
rescue Hal from his fall. Is the movie implying

510
00:46:42,396 --> 00:46:48,859
that green energy is not necessarily weak to
yellow energy if there's a sufficient quantity

511
00:46:48,879 --> 00:46:54,222
of the green energy? For some reason Hal was
able to withstand the yellow attacks. Was it

512
00:46:54,262 --> 00:47:01,225
because he had a whole lot of green energy?
I think so. That's convenient is all I'll say.

513
00:47:01,705 --> 00:47:06,315
But I guess it makes sense. I mean, why wouldn't
it? Hal was charged directly from the green

514
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:10,156
element, whereas other green lanterns, you know,
they're not as close to that power source,

515
00:47:10,276 --> 00:47:15,879
so they wouldn't have had as much energy to
battle Sinestra with. Right. Hal was like glowing

516
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:21,741
with so much green energy. The way I kind of
chose to think of it is, yes, ice is weak to

517
00:47:21,821 --> 00:47:28,244
fire. But if you have a whole lot of ice, it's
going to be harder for the fire to defeat the

518
00:47:28,324 --> 00:47:35,951
ice, to put it in Pokemon terms, I guess. Yeah.
One thing I thought about was the scene prior

519
00:47:36,171 --> 00:47:42,515
where Sinistro forces Hal Jordan to put his
fist into the power battery. It's almost like

520
00:47:42,535 --> 00:47:48,298
a proximity to the green element made it more
effective or more powerful. And for some reason,

521
00:47:48,338 --> 00:47:54,261
Hal Jordan was able to absorb that energy in
a way that other aliens had not been able to

522
00:47:54,341 --> 00:47:59,324
or even died trying to attempt that. Yeah, my
assumption is that no other alien had attempted

523
00:47:59,424 --> 00:48:05,264
to access the green element directly. Right,
yeah exactly. I did think it was really badass

524
00:48:05,304 --> 00:48:10,247
when he took the two moons and used it to crush
the yellow central power battery. That was

525
00:48:10,327 --> 00:48:15,350
a feat unlike any other. That was the most badass
thing I think I've ever seen a Green Lantern

526
00:48:15,391 --> 00:48:20,974
do. That was awesome. In the final scene of
the film, the Guardians recognized their discrimination

527
00:48:21,154 --> 00:48:26,318
against Hal was unwarranted, and they hold a
ceremony to honor him and the fallen lanterns.

528
00:48:26,798 --> 00:48:33,814
After leading the core in the oath of the Green
Lanterns, Hell flies into space to return to

529
00:48:33,934 --> 00:48:39,696
Earth. That's the end of the film. No, we never
saw the oath recited previously, right? No,

530
00:48:39,996 --> 00:48:45,678
it wasn't used as a mechanism to charge the
ring in this film. It was simply their pledge,

531
00:48:45,738 --> 00:48:49,539
sort of like the Pledge of Allegiance, which
works for me, because I always thought the

532
00:48:49,639 --> 00:48:53,680
oath was kind of a silly way to charge your
ring. Like just hold it up to the lantern,

533
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:59,395
you're good. That's true. I think in addition
to several... establishing scenes in the beginning

534
00:48:59,415 --> 00:49:03,618
of this movie, it would have been nice to have
an ending scene having him return to Earth

535
00:49:03,798 --> 00:49:09,503
and see how the experience changed him and his
relationship somewhat. Absolutely, yeah. The

536
00:49:09,543 --> 00:49:14,687
film should have been longer. It was dense and
they could have spread that out over a little

537
00:49:14,707 --> 00:49:20,832
bit more time pretty easily, you would think.
Yeah. Overall, the film was dense, but with

538
00:49:20,872 --> 00:49:27,936
fun action and cosmic lore, It's unapologetically
intended for fans of the source material, though

539
00:49:27,956 --> 00:49:34,901
I would say it struggles as an effective origin
tale. The voice cast was phenomenal, the animation

540
00:49:35,061 --> 00:49:41,625
was great, but ultimately I would say the film
is inaccessible to probably most audience members.

541
00:49:42,025 --> 00:49:48,369
And because of that, I'm giving this 3.5 out
of 5 stars. Still a fresh rating on Rotten

542
00:49:48,389 --> 00:49:53,800
Tomatoes, though. Yeah, I mean the movie has
its faults, especially with story and character

543
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:58,124
development, but I think that the pros outweigh
the cons, especially in terms of spectacle,

544
00:49:58,244 --> 00:50:02,067
you know, what you come to see a Green Lantern
movie for, the action and stuff, you know?

545
00:50:02,587 --> 00:50:06,450
And there was plenty of it and I would definitely
recommend the movie to Green Lantern fans,

546
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:11,495
absolutely. I will say though that I didn't
like it quite as much as Green Lantern Beware

547
00:50:11,515 --> 00:50:15,978
My Power or Green Lantern Emerald Nights, but
it goes to show that the character has some

548
00:50:16,058 --> 00:50:20,958
solid animated movies under his belt. If not,
you know, the live action movie. Yeah, I definitely

549
00:50:20,998 --> 00:50:25,840
hope they use this movie and probably Emerald
Nights, which I also really liked as a basis

550
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,622
for the upcoming series. Beware, my power is
also good, though I would like to see the show

551
00:50:30,662 --> 00:50:34,443
focus more on Green Lanterns, whereas beware,
my power focuses, you know, on a whole bunch

552
00:50:34,463 --> 00:50:40,386
of different alien races like the Raniens, the
Thanagarians. That may be important for a show

553
00:50:40,486 --> 00:50:45,328
set out in outer space, but I'm not sure if
Lanterns is going to do that. It better if

554
00:50:45,368 --> 00:50:52,227
it knows what's good for it. I agree. I agree.
But that does it for this review, AJ9K, help

earlier, we're going to find out who'd win

561
00:51:28,267 --> 00:51:34,390
in a fight between Atrocitus, the Red Lantern,
versus Juggernaut, the X-Men villain. It's

562
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:39,612
the Red Power Ring versus the Crimson Bands
of Scytorek. Yeah, of course, that is in lead

563
00:51:39,672 --> 00:51:45,695
up to our review of Deadpool and Wolverine,
since Juggernaut was a major player in the
