Welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, where we
discuss all things DC and Marvel related, we

2
00:00:05,602 --> 00:00:11,608
review superhero films, and we debate who would
win in Marvel vs. DC matchups. I'm Jonny DC.

3
00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:16,552
And I'm his twin brother Marvelous Joe. We're
formerly known as the DC Marvel Battlecast,

4
00:00:16,712 --> 00:00:22,737
so ignore all references to that in this episode.
And note that our new email address is dyna

5
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:30,613
You can also find us on Twitter and Instagram.
by searching for Dynamic Dual Podcast. Let's

6
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:31,114
start the show.

7
00:00:54,903 --> 00:00:59,928
today is Black Canary versus Black Widow. Yeah
that's gonna be a close one. Of all the matchups

8
00:00:59,948 --> 00:01:04,673
that we've had so far I think Black Canary and
Black Widow is probably going to be the closest

9
00:01:04,714 --> 00:01:08,718
match just from putting in the stats. They're
even more similar than Batman and Moon Knight

10
00:01:08,738 --> 00:01:14,747
were. Yeah I think so. So yeah look forward
to that later on. Black Canary is part of a

11
00:01:14,927 --> 00:01:20,809
super team called the Birds of Prey. Another
one of those team members was Barbara Gordon

12
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:29,453
aka Oracle aka Batgirl. Yeah, so this wasn't
officially released by the studio, but Warner

13
00:01:29,473 --> 00:01:35,536
Brothers kind of goofed. For people who have
seen the movie, they gave them this survey

14
00:01:36,036 --> 00:01:40,399
that was asking them questions like oh, you
know, how would you rate the actors in the

15
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:47,363
film? was Jenna Malone which we know has been
cut from the film. She'll appear in the rated-r

16
00:01:47,403 --> 00:01:52,566
version. So they're showing people the rated-r
version? No. No? No. But they left it in as

17
00:01:52,606 --> 00:01:57,429
part of the survey by mistake. So people were
like taking screenshots of that. So I mean

18
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:03,273
again this hasn't been officially released but
the likelihood of it being true is it's she's

19
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:09,638
pretty much Oracle which is pretty cool. I remember
when they first announced her casting I would

20
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,662
Kelly. That's what my guess was too. I think
that would have been awesome because it's a

21
00:02:16,682 --> 00:02:20,965
different way to portray Robin. Robin has never
been you know taken the most seriously out

22
00:02:20,985 --> 00:02:24,047
of all the superheroes. There's you know there's
always a lot of jokes so it made sense to me

23
00:02:24,067 --> 00:02:28,410
because it felt like that was the easiest way
to kind of get around that kind of stigma that's

24
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:33,193
attached to the character. But it's all about
like continuity and when you started reading

25
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:38,517
comics I'm pretty confident in saying that probably
most people's favorite Robin was Dick Grayson

26
00:02:38,877 --> 00:02:39,338
but a lot of

27
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,723
that role into Nightwing. So once you take Dick
Grayson out of the equation, what Robin are

28
00:02:47,763 --> 00:02:54,267
you left with? What Robins? People either like
Tim Drake or people like Damien Wayne. Everyone

29
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:59,731
loves The Dark Knight Returns. And doing Carrie
Kelly's, I thought it would have been a nice

30
00:02:59,751 --> 00:03:06,155
way to appease fans who sort of have one Robin
preference over another, I guess. Yeah, yeah,

31
00:03:06,195 --> 00:03:10,979
I think it would have been cool. But I'm equally
as happy with her being Barbara Gordon. Yeah,

32
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:15,702
it would be cool if they eventually do make
a Birds of Prey movie or something. My theory

33
00:03:15,822 --> 00:03:20,284
is that she's probably not going to be Oracle
in the rated R version. My theory is that they

34
00:03:20,304 --> 00:03:26,128
probably do a flashback with the Joker, the
rumors of them having a scene with the Joker

35
00:03:26,168 --> 00:03:30,190
where he's beating Jason Todd to death, the
scene where he's shooting Barbara Gordon in

36
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:36,550
the spine, paralyzing her, that famous scene
from the killing joke. And speaking of Commissioner

37
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:41,792
Gordon too, Mortar Brothers recently knows that
J.K. Simmons has been cast as Commissioner

38
00:03:41,832 --> 00:03:46,755
Gordon, which is awesome. I think you'd make
a good Commissioner Gordon, not as good as

39
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:51,637
a J. Jonah Jameson, but he'll make a good Commissioner
Gordon. I kind of bummed because I think a

40
00:03:51,657 --> 00:03:55,579
lot of people wanted J.K. Simmons to come back
in the role of J. Jonah Jameson for the new

41
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:01,041
Spider-Man movie by Sony coming out. And now
that's not going to happen, obviously. So that's

42
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:06,084
a little bummer. But I think that's pretty good
casting. It can't wait for. whenever they make

43
00:04:06,344 --> 00:04:10,807
the Batman movie, I mean, whatever it's called,
if it's just called The Batman, just like the

44
00:04:10,887 --> 00:04:15,970
Ben Affleck directed standalone Batman film.
Think of how many Oscar winners you're gonna

45
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:21,293
have in there. You're gonna have Ben Affleck,
J.K. Simmons. The Oscars mean nothing to me,

46
00:04:21,353 --> 00:04:26,677
so I'm not impressed. You're gonna have Jared
Leto. You're gonna have Jeremy Irons won an

47
00:04:26,737 --> 00:04:33,581
Oscar. Maybe Chris Terrio, if he goes back to
write it. It's gonna be a very high caliber

48
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:38,892
film. It's gonna be great. Just when you have
that level of talent, it has to be phenomenal.

49
00:04:39,722 --> 00:04:45,764
Yeah, that budget's going to be almost as big
as the $400 million by BBS. That's not true.

50
00:04:46,985 --> 00:04:52,467
How is Bad Members Superman doing? Actually,
it has the second highest pre-sale record of

51
00:04:52,508 --> 00:04:57,790
all time after Star Wars, which is awesome.
A lot of the way they track pre-sale tickets

52
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:06,834
is like in the first 24 hours, what percentage
of the available tickets are sold. For Star

53
00:05:06,874 --> 00:05:13,797
Wars, 75% in the first 24 hours. Why do they
track it that way? Why don't they just track

54
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:20,900
it in terms of dollars? I don't know. Because
they would have a record of that. I'm sure

55
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:27,362
they do. That's weird. But yeah, so Star Wars
has the highest number. I think it was 70,

56
00:05:27,842 --> 00:05:33,404
I think it was, like it was around 75%. Third
place goes to Jurassic Park, which had 50%.

57
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:42,018
Fourth place. was I believe Avengers Age of
Ultron. I mean, in Civil War tickets have gone

58
00:05:42,058 --> 00:05:48,103
on sale and I'm actually sure how that did.
I know it didn't do as good as BBS, but Batman

59
00:05:48,183 --> 00:05:56,831
v Superman did close to 60%, I believe. So it's
doing really well. Do you think it'll break

60
00:05:56,871 --> 00:06:03,337
200 million opening weekend? Over under. I think
it's gonna get close to 200 million. Yeah.

61
00:06:04,818 --> 00:06:14,189
And that's what a lot of, you know, like, film
industry commenters are now changing their

62
00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:17,794
prediction to. Yeah, because it used to be like
130 or something. It was between 100 and 140,

63
00:06:18,815 --> 00:06:24,986
essentially. So it should be Deadpool, at least.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure it'll be Deadpool. If

64
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:29,993
it doesn't, I will laugh. It's going to be definitely
mention it on the next podcast. It should be

65
00:06:30,013 --> 00:06:36,843
beat dead. It's the two biggest superhero icons
in the world. Yeah, but that doesn't just because

66
00:06:36,864 --> 00:06:45,043
they're icons. It doesn't equal box office revenue.
Familiarity as well. Otherwise Man of Steel

67
00:06:45,063 --> 00:06:50,365
would have done way better than it did. Familiarity
brings a lot to the table though. I mean, that's

68
00:06:50,405 --> 00:06:54,366
one of the reasons I think Marvel does so well.
Is because people are familiar with that Marvel

69
00:06:54,406 --> 00:06:59,187
brand. People are familiar with Batman. Those
movies have always been successful. DC doesn't

70
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:04,929
really have a cinematic brand right now though.
No, but we have the familiarity of our characters.

71
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:12,753
Well, people didn't go see Man of Steel because
of the bad taste of Superman Returns. But when

72
00:07:12,773 --> 00:07:20,397
you bring Batman into the mix, Batman has always
sold well. So... Yeah, I guess that's true.

73
00:07:21,738 --> 00:07:28,422
What about the familiarity of Sandman? I heard
that movie got delayed. Uh... Well, I mean,

74
00:07:28,442 --> 00:07:33,504
there was no like official start. I mean, you
could say it was delayed. You could say that,

75
00:07:33,564 --> 00:07:40,526
you know, it's still in development. Joseph
Gordon-Levitt, who was attached to definitely

76
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:46,209
direct and possibly star. Or I think he announced
that he was going to star like the day he announced

77
00:07:46,229 --> 00:07:54,992
that he was departing the project. He's departing
the project. So I can't imagine him as an anime.

78
00:07:55,012 --> 00:08:03,360
I don't know why. Can you? It's weird because
I always imagined him as Nightwing and I was

79
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,182
really pumped when he was in the Dark Knight
Rises. I kind of hoped that they would have

80
00:08:07,202 --> 00:08:11,364
done something with that. In my mind, I'm still
kind of hoping that he's gonna be Nightwing

81
00:08:11,464 --> 00:08:16,186
somehow, somewhere down the line. He's a pretty...
he... no, I don't think that would ever happen.

82
00:08:16,727 --> 00:08:21,589
No. Just because of the Dark Knight Rises. Yeah.
But he is a pretty broad range. I couldn't...

83
00:08:22,558 --> 00:08:28,599
If you give him like, you know, some 80s hair,
dark, long hair. Like a seagull's hair? Not

84
00:08:28,619 --> 00:08:34,661
bad. The Cure hair? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I could
see him as a dream. You know who I really saw

85
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:42,203
though was probably like Tom Hiddleston. Oh,
he would be fantastic. He would be a great

86
00:08:42,403 --> 00:08:48,525
dream. He's like almost the new Johnny Depp.
And I say that because, did you ever see Crimson

87
00:08:48,565 --> 00:08:51,941
Peak? It was the new- No, I saw the trailer
for it though. The Guillermo del Toro movie.

88
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:58,391
Right. That was very much- it was such kind
of like- the spiritual successor to Sleepy

89
00:08:58,431 --> 00:09:04,714
Hollow by Tim Burton with Johnny Depp. I almost
consider them companion pieces because they

90
00:09:04,734 --> 00:09:08,875
have a very similar setting and kind of just
really creepy kind of feel. If you haven't

91
00:09:08,895 --> 00:09:14,258
seen it, you should see it. But yeah, I think
Tom Hiddleston would be great because his character

92
00:09:14,298 --> 00:09:19,320
kind of reminded me of if this movie were made
in the early 90s, it would totally be Johnny

93
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,202
Depp in the role. So yeah, that's a good idea.

94
00:09:26,084 --> 00:09:33,311
Tom Hiddleston is Loki, he'll probably be Loki
for a while maybe. Yeah. But Sandman is so...

95
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:43,962
I mean, it's part of the DC universe just because
in the comic Sandman, aka Dream, aka Morpheus

96
00:09:44,242 --> 00:09:52,624
interacted with some of the... the characters,
like Marshall Manhunter, like the Scarecrow,

97
00:09:53,825 --> 00:10:05,212
like Dr. Destiny. But he's kind of like, if
anyone's not familiar with Sandman, it was

98
00:10:05,232 --> 00:10:15,106
a comic written in the 90s by Neil Gaiman. And
it was basically just about these... gods,

99
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:21,809
essentially these just sort of abstract concepts.
The primary character, his name was Dream,

100
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:31,493
and he was basically the embodiment of thought,
essentially, creativity. And so his stories

101
00:10:31,513 --> 00:10:38,377
were really way far out there, and you could
do almost anything with him. Yeah, I almost

102
00:10:38,397 --> 00:10:45,941
think it would make a better series because
of that fact. Oh, absolutely. within one plot

103
00:10:46,061 --> 00:10:52,186
arc with a series, you could have a new arc
each episode. Yeah, no. Anytime there's this

104
00:10:52,246 --> 00:10:59,112
big new comic book film announcement, I always
tell Barbara, my wife, don't let me die until

105
00:10:59,152 --> 00:11:09,401
this comes out. If they ever did an announcement
for a Sandman TV show. Oh my gosh, yeah, totally,

106
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:16,156
I just go into like. hyper sleep hibernation.
Oh, speaking of, and speaking of Johnny Depp,

107
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:27,160
you just made me realize Tim Burton would direct
like the most unbelievable, unbelievably good

108
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,843
version of Sandman or Guillermo del Toro. Yeah.
Or him. I, I don't know. I think Guillermo

109
00:11:32,863 --> 00:11:38,985
del Toro would be better because he, he's just
as dark as Tim Burton, but he's even more mature,

110
00:11:39,245 --> 00:11:44,708
I think. Cause like it would be hard to imagine
Tim Burton directing like a Blade 2 type thing.

111
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:49,450
But Guillermo can do everything Tim Burton can
do and more, I think. That's probably true.

112
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:55,053
Plus Tim Burton would probably try and change
it to suit his own story. Like Superman, uh,

113
00:11:55,073 --> 00:12:00,355
lips or whatever. Didn't, um, didn't Guillermo
Detorlo was he attached to direct Justice League

114
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:05,798
Dark? Is that still in development? Yes. Yeah.
With like, uh, Deadman and Constantine and.

115
00:12:06,418 --> 00:12:10,800
Yeah, that's another big one. I'm ever since
he mentioned that he was writing. That's the

116
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:16,682
one I'm looking forward to a lot just to see
Constantine on film again done I mean, I don't

117
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:21,363
want to say done right because I actually liked
the cannot reuse Constantine film Yes, but

118
00:12:22,204 --> 00:12:26,325
you know just more like the comics I guess more
like the Hellblazer character. Yeah. Yeah,

119
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:32,767
my wife loves The Constantine movie and the
TV show was great too. TV show is really good.

120
00:12:32,827 --> 00:12:40,803
Yeah, I was kind of bummed Well, I kind of it
kind of got kind of well it It kind of suffered

121
00:12:40,823 --> 00:12:47,369
from the same issues that kind of like the Daredevil
show did, I think, where they were trying to

122
00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:51,693
spread out too much story among too many episodes,
or too little story among too many episodes.

123
00:12:51,713 --> 00:12:56,217
So you kind of wanted to keep getting back to
the arc that was introduced in the first episode

124
00:12:56,237 --> 00:13:01,194
of Constantine, I think. And they kept going
off like on different tangents and... and some

125
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:05,456
of the actors annoyed me and stuff, but it was
a good show. It was a good show. Is he going

126
00:13:05,776 --> 00:13:10,318
to, has he showed up in Legends of Tomorrow
yet? Constantine? Yeah. The actor? No, he was

127
00:13:10,378 --> 00:13:16,681
in Arrow. That's earlier. Yeah. Which was, which
was a nice cameo. It's so hard to say goodbye

128
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:22,403
to Matt Reeves, the actor who played Constantine
as Constantine because he was spot on perfect.

129
00:13:22,683 --> 00:13:29,175
Cause they do adjust this like dark movie. I
mean. They'll probably go for like some big

130
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:33,421
name actor like Ewan McGregor or something like
that, which would be fine. Yeah, he would be

131
00:13:33,441 --> 00:13:39,188
good. But, uh, I'm gonna miss... I'm gonna miss
that Constantine. Well, hopefully he like joins...

132
00:13:39,208 --> 00:13:43,639
..the... The Legends of Tomorrow team, down
the line or something. Hopefully. They have

133
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:48,241
that option. They need a magic user on that.
Yeah, that'd be pretty cool. That'd be a pretty

134
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:55,184
cool way to use them. So yeah, hopefully Justice
League Dark comes out. You know what's not

135
00:13:55,224 --> 00:14:01,888
coming out this year? Gambit. And who called
it? We called it. I think you called it. Yeah,

136
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:06,710
I think everyone called it. Yeah, it was definitely
not, it was originally scheduled. Fox had a

137
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:12,432
schedule for October 7th, 2016 this year. I
think in our first, very first episode, as

138
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:18,394
we were going down the slate of movies, we mentioned
that it probably was not gonna get released

139
00:14:18,434 --> 00:14:24,596
this year because it doesn't, you know, as I
haven't started filming. They have a director

140
00:14:24,716 --> 00:14:32,759
and a star and a romantic lead, but that's about
it. That's right. Yeah. So it was pushed back.

141
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:39,001
They haven't said to where yet, although Fox
did announce two untitled Marvel films. One

142
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:46,395
of them being, pretty much the same date next
year, 2017, October 6th, 2017. And another

143
00:14:46,495 --> 00:14:55,138
one on January 12th, 2018. So, do you think
either of those will be Gambit? My guess is

144
00:14:55,418 --> 00:15:02,520
that, well, okay, so Wolverine 3 is scheduled
for March 3rd, 2017, about a year from now.

145
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:11,118
And that's kind of, it seems kind of behind
in production. If... If I had to guess, I bet

146
00:15:11,158 --> 00:15:18,760
you Gambit might take that March 3rd spot. Or
if it sticks with... No, but Wolverine's the

147
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,501
March 3rd. If Wolverine 3 sticks with March
3rd, then I bet you Gambit's gonna be released

148
00:15:22,821 --> 00:15:27,963
on that October 6th, 27th date. As far as the
January 12th, 2018, I can only guess Deadpool.

149
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:35,485
That would be my guess. Deadpool 2? Deadpool
2. Or X-Force? Uh... or X-Force. Yeah. I wonder

150
00:15:35,505 --> 00:15:41,575
what they're gonna do with that. Do you stick
with Deadpool, which has done so well? Or do

151
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:49,037
you sort of put him in a team dynamic? I think
they'll put him in a team dynamic. He certainly

152
00:15:49,077 --> 00:15:55,819
can join the current iteration of X-Men because
those actors are so young. And it's still in

153
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,080
the past, what is it now? It's in the 1980s.
And Deadpool takes place in the current time.

154
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,721
So I figure the only way they can have Deadpool
meet up with this current generation of actors

155
00:16:05,401 --> 00:16:10,842
is to bring... them from the past into the present.
I didn't even realize that. Like just skip

156
00:16:10,882 --> 00:16:15,166
over the 90s or something. Super tricky. Yeah,
they really screwed themselves over. They did?

157
00:16:15,446 --> 00:16:20,712
Wow. They kind of made their own continuity
gap and they're gonna have to pull like a crisis

158
00:16:20,752 --> 00:16:24,876
on infinite earths or something. But I mean
they brought the original X-Men team from the

159
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:30,441
comics into the future. Yeah, I wonder if they
would. X-Factor. They can totally do that.

160
00:16:31,226 --> 00:16:35,288
Yeah, and maybe that's what they'll call it.
They'll bring all those younger actors, they'll

161
00:16:35,308 --> 00:16:42,392
just skip over the 90s or something. And did
you hear my phone? Yeah. I just never read

162
00:16:42,632 --> 00:16:45,594
it. I don't know if you could hear or not. They'll
probably skip over the 90s maybe and just bring

163
00:16:45,614 --> 00:16:50,217
them right into like 30 years into the future,
into the present time. And the 2000s. And the

164
00:16:50,237 --> 00:16:57,041
2000s, yeah. I don't know what they're gonna
do. But I mean, going back to the release dates,

165
00:16:57,081 --> 00:17:01,737
I bet you. They've got to be thinking about
working on a Deadpool movie sometime soon,

166
00:17:01,797 --> 00:17:10,084
so I bet you it'll take place in January 2018.
And I bet you it'll be with the team. They

167
00:17:10,104 --> 00:17:15,610
already said that Cable is going to be in it,
so... Yeah, yeah. Well, I also remember that

168
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:21,735
the Fantastic Four movie, the sequel to the
Fantastic Four reboot, that was originally

169
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:33,098
slated for July 14th. 2017, so middle of next
summer. So I wonder if they'll... move Gambit

170
00:17:33,158 --> 00:17:39,640
or Wolverine to that date? Probably. There's
so many. Sometimes I just can't believe how

171
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:46,602
far in advance they're they're, you know, planning
these films. I mean, you look at Marvel's slate,

172
00:17:46,622 --> 00:17:55,304
you look at DC's slate, Justice League, and
then, you know, Yeah, we're going to be old

173
00:17:55,344 --> 00:18:01,547
men by the time Green Lantern comes out. I know.
Yeah, they announced that. Green Lantern may

174
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:07,973
not be appearing until Justice League 2 at like
the earliest. Like he may not even appear in

175
00:18:08,293 --> 00:18:14,119
Justice League 2. It may be because Justice
League right now I think is slated, Justice

176
00:18:14,139 --> 00:18:19,264
League Part 2 at least is slated for 2019, and
the Green Lantern movie was slated for 2020.

177
00:18:20,686 --> 00:18:26,252
I think that's right. The Green Lantern Corps
movie. What am I saying? Did I say Green Lantern

178
00:18:26,292 --> 00:18:34,082
Corps? Green Lantern Corps is slated for 2020.
Justice League Part 2 for 2019. Which I heard

179
00:18:34,122 --> 00:18:41,393
rumors that there was a cameo. Green Lantern
of Hal Jordan in Batman v Superman So to hear

180
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:46,657
that it's still gonna be you know like almost
half a decade Before we actually get to see

181
00:18:46,697 --> 00:18:54,163
another film version of him kills me why are
they doing that? Don't do that Yeah, well because

182
00:18:54,203 --> 00:18:59,308
really you want to see like the big DC 7 you
want to see the Magnus Vincent 7 You know on

183
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:04,432
screen at the same time right which I don't
know. I don't know if we were ever gonna see

184
00:19:04,452 --> 00:19:13,683
that in in Batman Reveals Superman just because
like they sort of leaked like what the flash's

185
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:17,944
cameo is. Oh they did? Have you heard about
that? I haven't heard about that. I don't know

186
00:19:17,964 --> 00:19:25,747
if I'll say. Well okay here's a spoiler. Okay
so jump ahead like two minutes or two three

187
00:19:25,787 --> 00:19:29,428
minutes. Two minutes. You don't want to hear
this. It won't take long. Okay. Alright and

188
00:19:29,448 --> 00:19:39,115
jump. Okay so his cameo is he appears in Batman's
nightmare sequence. He appears to warn Batman.

189
00:19:39,895 --> 00:19:46,840
So it's sort of like... So Flash can go into
dreams? Well, no, I think it's sort of ambiguous

190
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,623
as to whether or not it is a dream or if the
Flash takes him to the future to show him what

191
00:19:51,643 --> 00:19:57,627
the future's gonna be like if Superman takes
over or something like that. Why would Superman

192
00:19:57,667 --> 00:20:03,411
take over? I don't know. That's a good question.
Wait, is, okay, so is this a rumor or is this

193
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:11,753
confirmed, this cameo? This is... confirmed.
By whom? People who have seen the film. Okay.

194
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:19,946
Yeah. Alright. Yeah, it's so hard to stay off
the internet and not read these things. So

195
00:20:20,046 --> 00:20:24,428
I don't have the willpower. I don't do it anymore.
I completely spoiled myself on the first Avengers

196
00:20:24,448 --> 00:20:29,650
movie, and I knew everything that was going
to happen, including up to like all the good

197
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:33,852
parts. Everybody has such a good reaction to
like when the Hulk like said, puny God and

198
00:20:33,872 --> 00:20:38,574
everything like that. I already knew that was
coming because I read every little thing that

199
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:42,055
I could about the movie. And so I was not surprised.
It was like I was watching it for the second

200
00:20:42,095 --> 00:20:45,336
time when I watched it the first time. But I
mean, it's still enjoyable. The thing with

201
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:51,872
spoilers for me is I mean. I'm still able to
enjoy the film when everyone cries foul for

202
00:20:51,932 --> 00:20:58,857
showing doomsday or now even with Spider-Man
Which we'll get to later. I don't care. I'll

203
00:20:58,877 --> 00:21:02,879
still enjoy the film I think there's something
to be said for letting the surprises happen

204
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:09,383
when they're meant to happen though yeah, and
I purposefully stayed away from all spoilers

205
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:18,522
for the second Avengers movie and But even like
that flash, it's okay if you're here from when

206
00:21:18,562 --> 00:21:22,084
I said to jump ahead, because I'm not going
to mention what it is again. But even me telling

207
00:21:22,104 --> 00:21:27,829
you about that, does that ruin the film for
you? Do you think it will? Yes. No, it won't.

208
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:36,875
I don't know, maybe. I still don't believe it,
I don't think. I have trouble... I hope they

209
00:21:36,895 --> 00:21:43,351
don't write themselves into a corner, because...
That kind of scenario seems like you might

210
00:21:43,371 --> 00:21:49,835
write yourself into a corner with that. I have
faith in Chris Terrio. There was an article

211
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:56,058
recently done by the Wall Street Journal where
they interviewed him and the guy... He's a

212
00:21:56,078 --> 00:22:02,781
great speaker and he really sounds like he knows,
he did a ton of research for these films. And

213
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:07,303
he's really trying to, he was saying about like
how he wasn't sure he was gonna do Justice

214
00:22:07,343 --> 00:22:14,566
League until he went on set and he saw Jesse
Eisenberg do a scene with Holly Hunter. And

215
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:22,090
he was like really moved by it, I guess he was
saying. Was it a love scene? No, it's just

216
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:26,592
so moved by the love making, you just have to
keep writing these characters. He said he felt

217
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:32,537
like it felt like this really like indie cool
film and he was like I have to keep writing

218
00:22:32,577 --> 00:22:39,842
these characters. Which is cool. The things
he said in that Wall Street Journal article,

219
00:22:39,882 --> 00:22:44,346
which I haven't read the entirety of because
it's behind a freaking paywall, which sucks.

220
00:22:44,806 --> 00:22:49,490
I've read snippets and I want to read the whole
thing, but it seems like a really good article.

221
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:56,426
They interviewed Chris Terrio and Charles Rovin
and Ben Affleck. some interesting just sort

222
00:22:56,446 --> 00:23:02,369
of like inside information about the whole DC
Cinematic Universe in general, not just Batman

223
00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:07,951
v Superman came out through the article and
it was pretty cool. Cool. So if you do have

224
00:23:07,991 --> 00:23:13,273
that, if you are a subscriber to the Wall Street
Journal, Send us that article. Email us that

225
00:23:13,293 --> 00:23:21,877
shit because I want to read it. Another movie
that's in development that we heard this week

226
00:23:22,217 --> 00:23:29,529
is Venom. Right. But the big thing about that
is that it will be unrelated to the new Spider-Man.

227
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:37,275
I remember when I... because I heard this information
first, this news first, and I chatted it to

228
00:23:37,295 --> 00:23:42,318
you, or I texted it to you. I just remember
your reaction. I forgot what it was. I was

229
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:48,803
just like, bullshit or something. You were like,
nooooo! It doesn't make sense why Venom is

230
00:23:48,923 --> 00:23:55,850
such... I mean, he's a good character, and while
you could, I guess... I imagine that if they're

231
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:02,555
making it unrelated to Spider-Man, they're going
with the new Flash Thompson agent Venom route.

232
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:06,658
But I mean, even then, do you do Flash Thompson?
Because he's related to Spider-Man, they're

233
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:09,620
probably going to use... Because Spider-Man
is still in high school. Right, so they're

234
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:14,443
probably going to have Flash Thompson in the
new movie. It's kind of ridiculous. It's not

235
00:24:14,463 --> 00:24:18,726
going to be related to Spider-Man. Right. So...
It probably can't... I mean, how do you explain

236
00:24:18,786 --> 00:24:23,354
his look without Spider-Man? Maybe it'll be
Eddie Brock or something as the agent. Which

237
00:24:23,374 --> 00:24:27,535
would be stupid. I think... It can't be related
to... It's not related to Spider-Man. I don't

238
00:24:27,555 --> 00:24:30,175
think... I think it's gonna be an original character.
You know, I think this is gonna be... It can't

239
00:24:30,195 --> 00:24:34,036
be an original character. This is gonna be...
Fans will write it. This is gonna be Marvel

240
00:24:34,077 --> 00:24:41,579
slash Sony's version of Catwoman. Oh, like Catwoman
in name only? Right. With Halle Berry. So,

241
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,400
but see, when you just have that, then it's
just a guy with like an alien symbiote who's

242
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:52,970
just like a suit... He, like, kind of like spawn
or something. Which in itself is not... a terrible

243
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:57,334
concept, it's an interesting concept, but it's
not a venom. You're ruining the potential for

244
00:24:57,374 --> 00:25:05,627
the character in future Spider-Man movies, I
think. Yeah, I mean, I've heard people say,

245
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:11,611
some insiders say that they're speculating the
only reason that this isn't happening, which

246
00:25:11,651 --> 00:25:19,115
makes sense to me, is because Marvel has probably,
you know, said like we're not interested in

247
00:25:19,475 --> 00:25:26,351
Venom, like, anytime in the near future. So,
I mean, Sony's probably like, well, we have

248
00:25:26,371 --> 00:25:30,794
this great character in our stable. We might
as well do something with it, make money off

249
00:25:30,834 --> 00:25:37,237
of it somehow. But it's like... Stupid Sony.
They're really stupid. I don't understand.

250
00:25:37,257 --> 00:25:41,220
They're really stupid as studios. Like, if you
read, did you read any of those leaked emails?

251
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,462
I've seen, yeah, I've seen them. I saw so many
just bullshit emails. Like, they have no idea

252
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:49,584
what the fuck they're doing. It pisses me off
sometimes. I'm hoping this will turn into a

253
00:25:49,624 --> 00:25:55,046
case where... like, you know, fans bitch about
it so much that it ends up just getting pulled.

254
00:25:55,326 --> 00:25:59,968
That's what needs to happen. If you're if you're
listening to this bitch about it, bitch about

255
00:25:59,988 --> 00:26:06,410
it. Be the bitchiest bitch on the whole bitchy
planet. Be the biggest bitch that you know.

256
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:13,452
Boss bitch. Be the hashtag. Be the head bitch
in charge. You we have to complain. We have

257
00:26:13,512 --> 00:26:18,593
to. If we want. It makes no sense. You want
to save the character, even if they have no

258
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:25,388
immediate plans with him in the future. Eventually
they will. I mean, now I can't remember. Who's

259
00:26:25,428 --> 00:26:31,813
playing Spider-Man? What's his name? Tom Holland.
You know, he's a young kid He's probably in

260
00:26:31,873 --> 00:26:37,757
it for the long haul. You know, we're gonna
see him grow from a spider boy to a spider-man

261
00:26:37,817 --> 00:26:46,923
I'm assuming so I mean Save that use that potential
save that character For future movies. Well,

262
00:26:46,943 --> 00:26:51,858
you know and make it when people have long art
already long forgotten the Topher Grace Spider-Man

263
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:58,103
3 version. Yeah. Because there is a good story
to tell there. So... How long do you wait?

264
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:03,907
I mean, do you wait Green Lantern long? Or...
No, 10 years is fine. Spider-Man 3 came out

265
00:27:03,927 --> 00:27:07,610
in 2007, so if they wanted to... Even if they
threw Venom in the next movie... Holy cow,

266
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:13,534
I didn't realize it was that far. Yeah, time's
good by quick, man. But even next year, I think

267
00:27:13,554 --> 00:27:20,887
that's fine. It's a whole decade past. So...
yeah. Just when did I talk about fan pitching?

268
00:27:21,127 --> 00:27:27,612
It was like our second or third episode. Yeah.
And it does make a difference. Totally. Yeah.

269
00:27:27,652 --> 00:27:31,715
That's how I think that's how we got Apocalypse.
It's how we got Apocalypse. It does not look

270
00:27:31,815 --> 00:27:38,880
like Iva News. It's how we got Deadpool. It's
how we got the movie Deadpool made. So, yeah,

271
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:43,583
go out there. And even to an extent like Batman
v Superman, like just, you know, addressing

272
00:27:43,623 --> 00:27:50,030
the whole like this mass destruction issue,
you know. I don't think they could ever be

273
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:58,295
fixed. Unless Superman flies around the world
and goes back in time. I don't know. We'll

274
00:27:58,315 --> 00:28:02,517
see how it's addressed in Battle for Superman,
but I have a heart, I just don't see how he

275
00:28:02,537 --> 00:28:08,300
could redeem himself, I don't know. Well, Howard,
I mean, okay, so the new Civil War trailer

276
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:13,423
came out, and right from the beginning of the
trailer, they talk about the destruction that

277
00:28:13,783 --> 00:28:21,404
has been wrought in the past Marvel Cinematic
films. They could be redeemed, but Manifestale

278
00:28:21,444 --> 00:28:27,930
can't. They could be redeemed because they didn't
show an apparent lack of regard for human life

279
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:33,095
like Superman did. It was his first battle.
Actually, there's been a few interviews. I

280
00:28:33,115 --> 00:28:39,922
forget who did the interview. Who did it? With
Henry Cavill. He was just talking about that

281
00:28:40,462 --> 00:28:46,815
and how this film is sort of a response to that.
When the guy talks about Superman, it just

282
00:28:46,855 --> 00:28:53,301
makes you really appreciate him as the character.
He really understands the character and it's

283
00:28:53,581 --> 00:28:58,345
interesting to hear his approach. When he was
explaining the destruction, he was basically

284
00:28:58,525 --> 00:29:04,209
agreeing that he was an amateur, which sort
of makes the fight against Batman and Batman

285
00:29:04,229 --> 00:29:08,733
v Superman more interesting because he was saying
he's an amateur going up against someone very

286
00:29:08,773 --> 00:29:14,802
well versed in the art of war. And that's why
when people say that Superman... should always

287
00:29:14,842 --> 00:29:18,805
be able to beat Batman. There's no way Batman
should stand a chance. That was sort of his

288
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:28,153
argument saying, you know, Superman is still
very much new in this universe. But I mean-

289
00:29:28,173 --> 00:29:36,500
Shh, Superman would win. I still... Anyway,
I've always been the advocate every time I

290
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:41,605
read the Dark Knight returns or something like
that. What are you doing, Superman? Just freaking

291
00:29:41,625 --> 00:29:49,487
kill the guy. If any, he won't because he's
Superman. But I'm always never quite interested

292
00:29:49,527 --> 00:29:53,731
in seeing how those two fight because I always
think it should go another way. It is interesting

293
00:29:53,811 --> 00:29:59,356
to see that they are addressing consequences
in film. I mean, not only with BVS, but with

294
00:29:59,396 --> 00:30:06,842
the new Civil War trailer. It was hard for the
characters to even look at the past. The damage.

295
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:14,923
The damage, which, I mean. What? Wasn't... If
they can't handle that kind of, those kind

296
00:30:14,943 --> 00:30:19,425
of consequences, they couldn't stand it. They
couldn't handle the DC universe. DC universe

297
00:30:19,445 --> 00:30:24,048
is too much for them. You know what's surprising?
How many people do you think died in Zod's

298
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:33,433
attack on Metropolis? It's no less than five
million. No. That's not... What? That was a

299
00:30:33,473 --> 00:30:38,380
joke. If you had to put a number on it, how
many people do you think died? Actually, I

300
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:44,383
think they gave a number for at least the Wayne
Tower collapse. It was in the thousands. So

301
00:30:44,423 --> 00:30:51,628
it was in the thousands? Yeah. Looking at the
Civil War trailer, they did give the actual

302
00:30:51,828 --> 00:30:56,351
figures for each of those battles. Let's see.
Alright, so if you had to guess how many casualties

303
00:30:56,391 --> 00:31:02,800
were in the attack on New York, how many would
you guess? Marvel is so wussy. I mean, they

304
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:07,564
were like, oh, our heroes have to save everyone.
There can't be any consequences for this alien

305
00:31:07,584 --> 00:31:12,669
invasion. It's because they're good heroes,
unlike some people. That's bullcrap. How many

306
00:31:12,689 --> 00:31:20,717
people? What's your guess? 50. How many casualties?
50. Higher? 100. Lower? Are you shitting me?

307
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:27,438
74 people on the attack in New York. New York
is a big ass city and there are a ton. of the

308
00:31:27,498 --> 00:31:32,499
Leviathan monster going through building. Really,
Marvel Universe. 74. You know why? Because

309
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:37,301
they evacuated and they got people to save ground.
How many people do you think died in the Winter

310
00:31:37,321 --> 00:31:44,803
Soldier DC Helicarrier crash? None. 23. All
right, and how many people do you think died

311
00:31:44,823 --> 00:31:50,045
in the Sokovia in Avengers 2? Like one, and
that was Quicksilver. I would have thought

312
00:31:50,065 --> 00:31:54,635
it would have been the fewest, because, you
know, they... They went out of their way to

313
00:31:54,655 --> 00:32:02,682
show how many people there were. 177 people.
177 casualties. So overall, it's just a mere

314
00:32:02,722 --> 00:32:08,027
fraction of the people that died in Metropolis.
I just thought that was kind of funny. So go

315
00:32:08,067 --> 00:32:16,647
Marvel heroes. Am I right? I'm looking up the
current number for what the newspaper and the

316
00:32:16,707 --> 00:32:22,088
second Batman v Superman trailer showed the
death toll as. Oh. It's got a... There was

317
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:27,590
just one building. Thousands in one building.
Yeah, in the thousands. I forget the exact

318
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:32,971
number. Yeah. Overall... I can't remember if
it was just one building, or if it was the...

319
00:32:33,071 --> 00:32:40,193
I think it was actually the entire ordeal. It
would have to be in the thousands. Just...

320
00:32:40,213 --> 00:32:44,651
I remember thinking... Oh, thank God they've
knocked down all the buildings. There's nothing

321
00:32:44,731 --> 00:32:50,013
left to knock down. Then all of a sudden, you
know, like they'll come from like, or they

322
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:52,934
go into outer space and I'm like, oh, thank
God that they're done knocking down buildings.

323
00:32:52,974 --> 00:32:57,636
They'll find space now. And then they found
space. And then they crashed into the satellite.

324
00:32:58,016 --> 00:33:02,738
And then they brought the satellite down right
back onto the exact same city. And the satellite

325
00:33:02,778 --> 00:33:08,141
knocked down like another 10 buildings. It was
it was just nuts. Anyway. I put thousands of

326
00:33:08,181 --> 00:33:13,739
people die when stuff like this happens. I mean,
look at 9-11. That was what I think, like 3,000?

327
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:23,224
Right, yeah, and I think it's kind of weird
that 9-11 had such a huge impact on society,

328
00:33:24,404 --> 00:33:32,348
in real life, and in a movie where you have,
it's 9-11 times 1,000, and all that results

329
00:33:32,388 --> 00:33:41,355
from it is... Senate hearing with Superman.
It's a congressional hearing. Yeah, but that's

330
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:46,480
not legislation. That's just a hearing. I mean,
they need to start somewhere. I guess. I don't

331
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,365
know. Hopefully we'll see more along the line.
I'm sure we will. In Civil War we're actually

332
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:57,035
seeing... legislation and laws being passed
to put these guys in check. We're not seeing

333
00:33:57,115 --> 00:34:02,177
laws being passed in Batman versus Superman.
You don't know it. I don't know that. But I'm

334
00:34:02,197 --> 00:34:06,538
going to assume that because that's what I do.
What would you think of the trailer of the

335
00:34:06,558 --> 00:34:13,241
Civil War trailer? Yeah. It was. It was OK,
I think. It was not it was not my favorite

336
00:34:13,261 --> 00:34:18,895
trailer. I know people are going. just completely
nuts over it. It was not better than the last

337
00:34:18,935 --> 00:34:23,497
trailer. The first trailer was so good. I think
it had to do the music in this trailer. The

338
00:34:23,537 --> 00:34:28,439
first time I saw it, I was actually getting
kind of bored. But it didn't really show that

339
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:35,182
much new footage. It didn't show that much new
footage. The music was kind of somber and it

340
00:34:35,202 --> 00:34:40,985
was just like a lot of just really serious sounding
dialogue spoken just line by line by line.

341
00:34:41,005 --> 00:34:45,474
It was kind of monotone. The thing that I was
really looking forward to and I knew was coming

342
00:34:45,754 --> 00:34:50,496
because Marvel had announced it the day prior
that they were going to show Spider-Man at

343
00:34:50,516 --> 00:34:55,917
the At the end of the trailer. That's that's
what I was looking forward to so By like, you

344
00:34:55,937 --> 00:35:00,239
know two-thirds of the way through I'm like,
okay, just get to Spider-Man already that's

345
00:35:00,659 --> 00:35:06,461
really interesting gear your take on the whole
trailer because I You know just co-workers

346
00:35:06,501 --> 00:35:10,158
and stuff. They they you know come to me and
they're like, oh what you think? It was so

347
00:35:10,178 --> 00:35:13,320
good, it was the greatest thing ever, wasn't
it? It was so good, I'm like, yeah, it's Marvel.

348
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:21,507
Don't get me wrong, don't get me wrong. I think
it had some amazing wow moments to it, but

349
00:35:21,547 --> 00:35:24,009
overall I don't think the trailer was

350
00:35:27,072 --> 00:35:32,496
as cohesive as the last one, I think. The last
one, which is really the first one, the last

351
00:35:32,576 --> 00:35:40,963
one, yeah, the first one really clearly defined
the themes and I was excited to see it. and

352
00:35:41,023 --> 00:35:48,390
it had well moments too. Like at the end when
Captain Bucky or taking Iron Man and stuff

353
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:54,115
like that. This one had a few well moments too.
This one had more well moments I would say.

354
00:35:54,175 --> 00:36:02,723
It had more spectacle. We got to see Ant-Man
on one of Hot Guy's arrows. I kind of wish

355
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:07,614
they would have saved that for the movie. I
didn't want to see that now out of context

356
00:36:07,654 --> 00:36:14,036
or anything, but that was an incredible shot
in the trailer. I watched that over and over

357
00:36:14,056 --> 00:36:20,238
again. It was like fake. I was actually surprised
how much from this film looked fake. Well,

358
00:36:20,618 --> 00:36:25,380
I'm sure the effects aren't done yet. Yeah.
I think that, I mean, the standout for me other

359
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:34,527
than Spider-Man, I guess, is Black Panther.
Yeah, you get to see... Chadwick Boseman as

360
00:36:34,607 --> 00:36:38,990
T'Challa. He's in one of those blasts at the
beginning of the trailer. You think his father

361
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:43,653
died right there? Yeah, I think T'Chaka died
right there. He just became the new king? Yeah,

362
00:36:43,773 --> 00:36:48,557
and I think that's why he's going after the
Winter Soldier. See, what confuses me is occasionally

363
00:36:48,677 --> 00:36:54,441
you'll see in later shots, like when Iron Man
hits Captain America and says, you just started

364
00:36:54,521 --> 00:37:04,248
war, there's this figure in a tube in the background,
and it looks... really similar to the container

365
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:10,433
that Winter Soldier was being held in at the
beginning of the trailer. So, and this is just

366
00:37:10,453 --> 00:37:15,397
speculation, I don't think this is a spoiler,
but it makes me wonder what... Do you think

367
00:37:15,417 --> 00:37:19,880
they cloned Bucky and maybe it's a Bucky clone
that's causing all this damage and stuff, and

368
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:23,863
that's why they think he did it and why they're
going after him and all that stuff? Would they

369
00:37:23,883 --> 00:37:28,995
be able to do that? I don't know. I don't know
if they would... go that science fictiony with

370
00:37:29,015 --> 00:37:32,498
that. It's interesting. I've never, I haven't
heard that anyone speculate that. Yeah. No

371
00:37:32,538 --> 00:37:37,482
one speculated that. That's me speculating that.
I think it would make sense for why they would

372
00:37:37,522 --> 00:37:40,585
suspect the Winter Soldier's doing all this
stuff. I do have to admit, like just watching

373
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:46,670
the trailer, the Winter Soldier's a dick. I
don't know if it's just like clever editing.

374
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:51,154
Like when he shoots down war machines, like,
oh, that guy's. Well, he had a rifle. It was

375
00:37:51,194 --> 00:37:55,637
just kind of, that's the way it was cut. We
don't know wherever that energy beam came out.

376
00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:02,575
where that came from, I don't know. I'm pretty
sure it was someone on Team Cap. It almost

377
00:38:02,595 --> 00:38:09,541
looks like one of Vision's blasts. Really? I
wonder if Scarlet Witch, again, we don't know

378
00:38:09,561 --> 00:38:14,264
anything about this movie, this is just- You
think she hijacks him? Yeah, I wonder if she

379
00:38:15,946 --> 00:38:20,830
mentally manipulates him. She hijacks him into
loving her? Because we know that she can read

380
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:28,047
his mind, because she read his mind in Avengers
Age of Ultron. Back when he had Ultron's mind

381
00:38:28,107 --> 00:38:31,109
and she saw that he was gonna cause like damage
and destruction and that's when they eventually

382
00:38:31,149 --> 00:38:35,952
turned on Ultron So we know that vision has
a mind to read so maybe I'm wondering if she

383
00:38:35,972 --> 00:38:40,495
manipulates that somehow Because that would
definitely turn the tide, you know, there are

384
00:38:40,535 --> 00:38:46,218
not a lot of heavy hitters on team cap You can
go up against someone like vision. Yeah, I

385
00:38:46,259 --> 00:38:50,021
was always wondering that I was like Well, who's
team is vision on because that's the thing

386
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:54,127
that's gonna win Right, and when you combine
that with the Ithmore machine and Iron Man,

387
00:38:54,208 --> 00:39:04,360
I think I can see it going that way. Um, but
yeah, so going to the other big moments in

388
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:10,963
the film, we saw the, um, it looked like the
raft, um, in coming out of the water. It's

389
00:39:11,003 --> 00:39:16,866
the super, the superhero, supervillain, uh,
prison. It looks like, you know, instead of

390
00:39:16,886 --> 00:39:20,227
the negative zone, because they don't have the
negative zone nor do I think they have the

391
00:39:20,247 --> 00:39:26,282
rights to the negative zone. I think that's
a fantastic four thing with Fox. But so instead

392
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,644
of being in the negative zone, it looks like
the prison is like deep in the middle of the

393
00:39:29,724 --> 00:39:38,389
ocean. And so that was pretty interesting. What
is that? Is that in the comic? A prison? In

394
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:46,614
the Civil War series, Mr. Fantastic created
a prison in the negative zone to put people

395
00:39:46,654 --> 00:39:51,837
who violate the superhero registration act.
Okay, yeah. So yeah, that was pretty cool to

396
00:39:51,877 --> 00:39:59,640
see. You know what else was cool to see in the
trailer? Spider-Man. That's really what I was

397
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:07,305
looking forward to, as I just said. And what
did you think of him? I wanna get your thoughts

398
00:40:07,325 --> 00:40:13,629
before I give my thoughts. I didn't know he
was actually gonna be in the trailer. I didn't

399
00:40:13,649 --> 00:40:22,262
see the news saying that he was gonna be in
there. Oh no? I wasn't like... excited when

400
00:40:22,282 --> 00:40:27,505
he was there just but I just don't care about
Spider-Man. He's sort of he's only had like

401
00:40:27,605 --> 00:40:34,669
two movies like good movies out of five movies.
I don't know I'm kind of over the character

402
00:40:34,729 --> 00:40:41,713
really and I think Iron Man has kind of supplanted
him as like the main Marvel uh you know flagship

403
00:40:41,933 --> 00:40:50,158
kind of character sort of like what Superman
is or you know maybe Batman to DC. Um I Okay,

404
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:58,045
so where my first reactions the costume looked
super CG it did Yeah, I don't know how I feel

405
00:40:58,085 --> 00:41:05,851
about the customer. I feel like Andrew Garfield's
so I ran costume in the second one amazing

406
00:41:05,871 --> 00:41:15,479
spider-man 2 is better Just because I had the
really big eye Lens lenses. I don't like the

407
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:15,900
small

408
00:41:18,906 --> 00:41:23,970
spider on his chest. I didn't really care about
like the sort of like the updates to the suit

409
00:41:24,310 --> 00:41:31,536
or I had like the blue like bands or stripes.
Oh on the on the deltoids and on the on the

410
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:42,505
elbows. Yeah I also wasn't a fan of his web
shooters the wrists the bracelets. I keep going

411
00:41:42,585 --> 00:41:47,849
on and on about what I how much I did like those
I mean those are just nitpicks. I'm glad he's

412
00:41:47,869 --> 00:41:53,782
in the movie. it's gonna be really cool to actually
see, you know, the, I think, you know, it's

413
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:59,967
gonna be Marvel's Spider-Man. Just the voice,
that was a perfect voice. Really? I thought

414
00:42:00,007 --> 00:42:06,652
so. I mean, it's young, it was kind of like
borderline cocky, borderline like unsure, I

415
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:10,996
thought. It's a lot to read into one line, but
I thought he nailed it. Really, because I didn't

416
00:42:11,016 --> 00:42:16,360
get any hint of cockiness to it. I thought it
was almost a Andrew Garfield kind of take,

417
00:42:16,741 --> 00:42:24,985
where it was almost kind of like, a little shy,
maybe, like, here, everyone. Maybe I just kinda

418
00:42:25,005 --> 00:42:29,868
got the implication of the cockiness just because
like his squint at the end, maybe. Which is

419
00:42:29,948 --> 00:42:37,012
so cool. Okay, the one thing I really did like
about seeing Spider-Man is the way they interpreted

420
00:42:37,292 --> 00:42:44,676
his, they found a way to make his eyes show
emotion, grow big and grow smaller. But it

421
00:42:44,696 --> 00:42:48,674
wasn't, I thought they were probably gonna go
like the Deadpool route. where his eyes were

422
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:56,199
essentially just CG, but they incorporated something
that makes sense with the story, some kind

423
00:42:56,259 --> 00:43:00,642
of tech, because you could hear the whirring
sound. Yeah, because if you think about it

424
00:43:00,882 --> 00:43:05,485
in Deadpool, that didn't make sense, the way
his eyes moved with the mask. No, it worked.

425
00:43:06,386 --> 00:43:13,211
It worked maybe because the tone of the movie
was, it's not something that you thought about

426
00:43:13,271 --> 00:43:19,150
because he's kind of such a cartoony character
and breaks the fourth wall. You can't really

427
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:25,234
nitpick it like that. I honestly wonder though,
like, I mean, in all the Batman films, they

428
00:43:25,274 --> 00:43:29,636
never really gave him lenses just because they
wanted to be able to see his eyes so that he

429
00:43:29,656 --> 00:43:33,578
could emote. But I think if, even if he did
the Deadpool route and something like that,

430
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:40,602
it would still work. I don't think people would
care if Batman's eyebrows moved. I think they

431
00:43:40,622 --> 00:43:47,446
would get over it. But I think you sort of avoid
that controversy. whether they would care with

432
00:43:47,486 --> 00:43:55,089
what they do with Spider-Man. Yeah, I'm a big
fan. So here are my thoughts. I was super excited

433
00:43:55,689 --> 00:44:01,331
when I first saw the web. I was like, oh, OK.
Well, first of all, they nailed the web. I

434
00:44:01,351 --> 00:44:05,313
don't think they've ever got the web wrong,
though. The look of the web looks pretty cool.

435
00:44:05,573 --> 00:44:15,265
Yeah, it's always. After I watched it in hindsight,
so he does the superhero landing, the pose.

436
00:44:16,847 --> 00:44:21,471
He looks really sweet holding Captain America's
shield. And I wonder, it's such a cool visual.

437
00:44:22,012 --> 00:44:27,804
And I wonder if it would... be such a cool visual
if he wasn't holding cap shield. I thought

438
00:44:27,904 --> 00:44:33,728
the costume looked fantastic. I was like, oh,
that's exactly how we should look. It looks

439
00:44:35,149 --> 00:44:42,614
like Marvel Spider-Man with a modern updated
suit. But then, of course I'm going back and

440
00:44:42,814 --> 00:44:48,942
playing that part over and over again. And the
more I watched it, the more I kind of... Obviously

441
00:44:49,002 --> 00:44:53,925
the CGI isn't finished, but I was kind of disappointed
because the suit looked like rubber to me.

442
00:44:54,265 --> 00:45:00,268
It looked kind of balloon-y. And when you have
a character like Spider-Man, whose face is...

443
00:45:01,649 --> 00:45:09,534
very bulbous, you know? I think it's a weird
choice to give him a rubber suit because it

444
00:45:09,574 --> 00:45:14,317
makes it look such like a balloon. It looked
flat. It did look a little flat. I think...

445
00:45:16,218 --> 00:45:19,379
you know, obviously the special effects aren't
finished, so it'll look different in the final

446
00:45:19,419 --> 00:45:25,761
cut. I did get, I did download, you know, the
super, super high res and I maxed it out and

447
00:45:25,821 --> 00:45:32,444
I looked, got a really good close look at the
suit. And actually to my surprise, what I first

448
00:45:32,484 --> 00:45:37,046
thought was rubber and no texture, turns out
that it's texture. It's not rubber. There's

449
00:45:37,066 --> 00:45:43,569
a lot of texture actually. The red portion of
the costume, it's almost like a denim. It looks

450
00:45:43,589 --> 00:45:49,954
like, it looked like a red. denim type of fabric,
but thicker than like what's on your jeans.

451
00:45:50,434 --> 00:45:54,478
So that's pretty cool. And in the blue parts,
I thought those are flat too, but if you zoom

452
00:45:54,498 --> 00:45:59,243
in close enough, it's actually like a Jersey
type material, like a thick Jersey, not like

453
00:45:59,303 --> 00:46:04,568
with all the holes, like a, like a, like one
of those new Reebok hockey jerseys, if you're

454
00:46:04,588 --> 00:46:11,318
familiar with those, the ones that Reebok made
like a three or four years ago. So yeah, it's

455
00:46:11,338 --> 00:46:15,139
like a jersey material, a denim material. It's
very fabric-y. I think it looks pretty cool.

456
00:46:15,259 --> 00:46:19,300
And I hope that texture really stands out during
the course of the film, because I think it's

457
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:26,202
that texture that keeps it, you know, really
from looking cartoony. Yeah, I don't think

458
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:33,524
I realized how important texture was in a superhero
suit until Man of Steel. I think, I mean, I

459
00:46:33,544 --> 00:46:37,125
think it started with- Yeah, comparing Superman
Returns and the Man of Steel costume. Well,

460
00:46:37,145 --> 00:46:42,179
I mean, no, if it's- Because Superman Returns
didn't have- any on the blue part. It was all

461
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:47,342
a really flat and bland. And like, I think it
started with Sam Raimi's version of Spider-Man

462
00:46:47,362 --> 00:46:51,684
because I really liked that costume. I liked
the texture on it. I didn't understand why

463
00:46:51,945 --> 00:46:58,168
they had it. I had read articles that it was
for like. And sort of like a dimension to it,

464
00:46:58,188 --> 00:47:02,171
it makes it look a little bit more interesting
if you had a texture to it. I didn't see that

465
00:47:02,211 --> 00:47:06,393
texture in the in the Captain in the Civil War
trailer on Spider-Man. I think you'll see in

466
00:47:06,413 --> 00:47:11,943
the movie. I mean, I don't know if I saw the
super high rise version. Like I had to take

467
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:16,793
a really good close look to even see that there
was texture even there. I think that's sort

468
00:47:16,853 --> 00:47:22,731
of. And you know, I thought like the black webbing
was really, it wasn't as pronounced as it was

469
00:47:22,751 --> 00:47:25,892
in previous films. Like in the Sam Raimi- No,
it's thinner. It's a thinner, yeah, thinner

470
00:47:25,912 --> 00:47:29,794
line. Yeah, it was in the Sam Raimi version.
Like it was almost like upraised. It was, yeah.

471
00:47:29,814 --> 00:47:34,635
But in this version, it's not as- It's a little
inset almost. Almost kind of similar to how

472
00:47:34,715 --> 00:47:42,962
the Andrew Garfield suit was. I think that was
inset as well. Although I didn't like- If I'm

473
00:47:43,002 --> 00:47:48,224
ranking the Spider-Man costumes, I will put
the first Amazing Spider-Man movie, that costume

474
00:47:48,244 --> 00:47:53,727
that he had there. The texture was cool, it
kind of reminded me of a, kind of like basketball,

475
00:47:53,967 --> 00:47:58,769
but the design of the Spider-Man outfit was
horrendous. I hate it. Every time I went to

476
00:47:58,789 --> 00:48:03,432
the store and I saw that stupid Spider-Man,
Amazing Spider-Man, with the stupid yellow

477
00:48:03,612 --> 00:48:07,918
eyes, I just wanted to break stuff. That was
a really weird choice. Yeah, I thought you

478
00:48:07,938 --> 00:48:10,660
were saying that was your number one ranked
costume. Oh, no, it's my... You're starting

479
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,703
from the bottom. Yeah, starting from the bottom.
Okay. Yeah, I hated that costume. You could

480
00:48:14,744 --> 00:48:18,647
ask my wife. I was pissed off every time I saw
those stupid yellow eyes. I'm like, Spider-Man

481
00:48:18,707 --> 00:48:25,092
does not have yellow eyes. What the hell are
you thinking? Well, I love the eyes. Fanboy

482
00:48:25,112 --> 00:48:28,695
bitching. Yeah, they changed it for the second
one. I think if I have to pick the very best

483
00:48:28,735 --> 00:48:33,614
version of the Spider-Man costume in movies,
it would be... The amazing spider-man 2 yeah,

484
00:48:33,634 --> 00:48:39,617
I agree because he had the big eyes It seems
like they took a lot of the cues from Remy's

485
00:48:39,657 --> 00:48:46,041
spider-man costume they give it that texture
and it was it was very the classic design and

486
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:54,265
the blue was a little bit darker and Yeah, I
think it looks fantastic And this suit that

487
00:48:54,285 --> 00:49:00,829
they have is much less the classic look he He
has the external web shooters, which actually

488
00:49:01,049 --> 00:49:06,564
kind of like the look of but his belt is very
much different and his sleeves look a little

489
00:49:06,584 --> 00:49:11,348
bit different. They went much wider on the sleeves
than they typically do. Well, on the red part

490
00:49:11,388 --> 00:49:17,352
on the sleeves, I should say, because Spider-Man
always has the inside of his bicep area and

491
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:23,396
inner forearm is always blue and the outside
is the red with the webbing. Well, like at

492
00:49:23,416 --> 00:49:27,559
the glove area, he does this. Right, and at
the glove, it becomes full red. It's full red.

493
00:49:29,821 --> 00:49:38,015
So this one... They went much wider with the
outside red web area. And it kind of reminds

494
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:44,817
me of Captain America's suit, the way they did
the sleeve design in the first Avengers movie.

495
00:49:45,377 --> 00:49:49,779
He had like, most of his sleeve was blue and
they had a small patch of white around the

496
00:49:49,799 --> 00:49:53,840
inner bicep area. And it looks like they're
doing the same thing with this costume. So

497
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:58,121
that's pretty interesting. I mean, that's not
a nitpick. I think it's a good choice just

498
00:49:58,141 --> 00:50:02,462
because it's different. And we haven't really
seen it before. I guess if I have any gripe,

499
00:50:03,503 --> 00:50:10,808
it's probably the spider. The symbol, yeah,
really small. The belt. The belt, while functional,

500
00:50:11,889 --> 00:50:16,252
because it looks like it holds as spare cartridges
of webbing, it is black. That was my guess

501
00:50:16,332 --> 00:50:19,895
as well. I'm guessing that this suit is- It
wasn't black, it was dark blue, wasn't it?

502
00:50:19,935 --> 00:50:23,137
Was it dark blue? I thought I saw dark blue.
I thought I saw black. But then again, you

503
00:50:23,177 --> 00:50:28,621
saw a high-res version. I didn't. It was black.
Really? Well, that's disappointing. Yeah, it's

504
00:50:28,641 --> 00:50:35,394
black. But it's black containers over a red
belt. So there's hints of red in between. Yes.

505
00:50:35,634 --> 00:50:41,558
Really? Yeah. So I think this suit is the one
that's designed by Iron Man. I don't think

506
00:50:41,638 --> 00:50:46,242
we'll get a version of the Iron Spider like
that was in the Civil War comic where he had

507
00:50:46,282 --> 00:50:50,245
kind of like, Yeah. Doctor Octopus spider legs
coming out of his jaw. Which I have to say,

508
00:50:51,686 --> 00:50:56,129
I liked that suit. Oh. It was a cool suit for,
You know a suit I really liked? It was a temporary

509
00:50:56,149 --> 00:51:00,556
suit, so it was cool. Yeah. I really liked the
superior Spider-Man when Doc Ops took over

510
00:51:01,097 --> 00:51:07,703
Spider-Man. I loved that suit. That was a fantastic
suit. That was a fantastic story, I think.

511
00:51:07,743 --> 00:51:15,269
But no, I mean, just going back to the suit
in the trailer, yeah, definitely had some tech

512
00:51:15,289 --> 00:51:20,434
with it. I'm definitely interested to see how
much involvement Tony Stark had with helping

513
00:51:20,594 --> 00:51:21,214
Andrew Garfield.

514
00:51:25,026 --> 00:51:32,871
kid with low on resources who survives by his
wits, you know, sort of. So to have him, I

515
00:51:32,891 --> 00:51:37,274
don't know, his Marvel debut, you know, come
out with some fancy tech suit, I don't know

516
00:51:37,294 --> 00:51:42,378
how I'm kind of- I'm sure that's not his first
suit. I'm sure the first suit that he shows

517
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:50,103
in the film is probably before Iron Man, you
know, gets ahold of him and brings him onto

518
00:51:50,123 --> 00:51:54,983
his team. I'm betting his first suit is probably-
kind of like the concept art that we've seen.

519
00:51:55,003 --> 00:51:59,066
I don't know if it's fan art or concept art,
but it's kind of like a hoodie with like goggles

520
00:51:59,146 --> 00:52:03,609
and stuff. It looks pretty cool. Yeah, I hope
that's it because- I totally forgot about that.

521
00:52:03,729 --> 00:52:07,892
For some reason I was thinking that, you know,
when he says underoos in the trailer, which

522
00:52:08,052 --> 00:52:13,095
was funny. It was funny. I was thinking that
was probably gonna be the first time we see

523
00:52:13,276 --> 00:52:19,160
Spider-Man in the film, not Peter Parker, but
Spider-Man, just because it seemed like some

524
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:25,337
kind of like grand entrance kind of thing. Yeah.
I don't think so. I wonder how much involved

525
00:52:25,357 --> 00:52:32,342
he is. It would be too out of left field if
he just kind of appeared. And there's not anybody

526
00:52:32,562 --> 00:52:36,303
who's not familiar with the character of Spider-Man,
so I don't think people would be like, who

527
00:52:36,323 --> 00:52:41,345
the heck is this guy? But I mean, if there ever
was a person who wasn't familiar with Spider-Man,

528
00:52:41,365 --> 00:52:44,446
and they'd be like, what the heck just happened
in this movie? Where did this guy come from?

529
00:52:44,486 --> 00:52:48,927
Who is he? What's going on? So it wouldn't quite
make sense. So I'm pretty positive that's not

530
00:52:48,947 --> 00:52:54,128
the first time we see him. I'm pretty sure we
will see him in his first, the first incarnation

531
00:52:54,188 --> 00:53:02,845
of his homemade costume. And then it'll go from
there. One last thing about the eyes. I have

532
00:53:02,986 --> 00:53:10,351
always been a huge fan of the thick. black line
around the eyes, like the Alex Ross style of

533
00:53:10,471 --> 00:53:17,453
eyes, as opposed to the really Todd McFarland,
the huge... I like big eyes, but I like the

534
00:53:17,473 --> 00:53:23,855
thick black line around the eyes. I never liked
the really pencil thin around the white. They

535
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:28,876
had that in the Sam Raimi films. They had that
in... Yeah, the Sam Raimi films, I feel like

536
00:53:28,897 --> 00:53:34,720
that's different. Those felt very much... You
know, they were designed by Oakley. They felt

537
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:39,267
very much like lenses. Yeah. In the Amazing
Spider-Man, they felt less like lenses and

538
00:53:41,249 --> 00:53:46,757
they had a little bit of texture to them as
well. And those are good. But I think these

539
00:53:46,777 --> 00:53:51,035
will be my favorite eyes just because I really
love the Alex Ross style. of the eyes, I think

540
00:53:51,456 --> 00:53:56,623
you can express more with them. And I'm glad
that they've taken that route because yeah,

541
00:53:56,643 --> 00:54:00,048
you'll be able to show emotion with the eyes
and with the mask, as opposed to the thin line

542
00:54:00,088 --> 00:54:04,093
in which you don't, you can only do so much
with the expression. I was kind of, I kind

543
00:54:04,173 --> 00:54:10,417
of opposite. I was like the big white eyes.
But I mean, yeah, it's a good look. As much

544
00:54:11,459 --> 00:54:17,586
as I griped on it at the beginning when we first
started talking about him, he looks great.

545
00:54:18,067 --> 00:54:27,918
Yeah, I'm excited. I'm excited. Yeah, I can't
wait. I hope he's in the movie. more than just

546
00:54:27,938 --> 00:54:32,442
kind of like a cameo. Like he's, it looks like
he's at the end of the big fight scene at the

547
00:54:32,742 --> 00:54:37,086
airport. And that might be it. I hope that's
not the extent of his action. I don't know

548
00:54:37,106 --> 00:54:42,951
if he'll actually get into, you know, fisticuffs
and or fight anybody else or if, but- I wonder

549
00:54:42,971 --> 00:54:47,495
how much they're gonna show him in like marketing
material. I at least want to see him like take

550
00:54:47,515 --> 00:54:51,759
down some like burglars or something like that,
you know? Yeah. Hopefully. I don't know how

551
00:54:51,779 --> 00:54:57,440
much the, they haven't shown him- anything about
him until this trailer. So I don't know how

552
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:03,247
much he'll actually appear in marketing materials.
Mike is his own poster. Mike, he'll move. That's

553
00:55:03,267 --> 00:55:06,771
right, because they come out with those posters.
Yeah, he wasn't part of it. He wasn't a part

554
00:55:06,791 --> 00:55:10,675
of it. Those were terrible posters. They were
terrible posters. It was just the profile of

555
00:55:10,715 --> 00:55:16,974
the face. Yeah. Without any masks on anybody.
Yeah, that was interesting. I would have. why

556
00:55:16,994 --> 00:55:22,805
they chose that direction. Was it just to humanize
the whole thing? I would have preferred to

557
00:55:22,865 --> 00:55:29,427
have seen their masks. The Black Panther costume
is still, I think... It's amazing. It's great.

558
00:55:29,607 --> 00:55:35,830
It's great. I really like it. Yeah, I think
they just came out. Sometimes I think they

559
00:55:35,850 --> 00:55:38,711
don't put a whole lot of thought to the marketing
materials. They just put something out there,

560
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:45,294
you know, to keep the buzz going. Yeah. I can't.
I kind of wondered how much like because, you

561
00:55:45,314 --> 00:55:51,957
know, the day that the trailer came out, the
movie posters came out a few days before. And

562
00:55:51,997 --> 00:55:57,340
it's like, no tickets are on sale. Why are tickets
on sale so far in advance for the film? They're

563
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:02,001
trying to bite into the Bambi B Superman sales
tickets, I think. But whatever. That's just

564
00:56:02,061 --> 00:56:07,464
paranoia, man. Those posters aren't helping
them sell tickets. I mean, yeah, for sure.

565
00:56:07,484 --> 00:56:11,945
They'll probably come out with more posters
before the release. Yeah. But you know who

566
00:56:11,985 --> 00:56:17,067
had some pretty cool posters? The Daredevil
ones. Those Daredevil posters were pretty sweet.

567
00:56:17,368 --> 00:56:24,098
We finally got a look at Frank Castle's Punisher
Skull on his shirt. Finally. And I think the

568
00:56:24,138 --> 00:56:29,140
skull looks fantastic. I think it's the best
iteration of it. We didn't get to see it fully,

569
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:35,081
but I mean, from what we saw, it looks really,
it's big, it's like dark. Yeah. In War Zone,

570
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:40,863
it was kind of subtle and it almost looked like
it was printed onto like a mesh that he wore

571
00:56:40,923 --> 00:56:44,364
over his Kevlar. And it was very angular. It
was very angular. As opposed to like the Thomas

572
00:56:44,404 --> 00:56:48,105
Jane one looked very like organic. Thomas Jane
was very organic. It looked very spray painted,

573
00:56:48,145 --> 00:56:51,840
kind of graffiti style. This one has kind of
that same style, but it's a good combination

574
00:56:51,860 --> 00:56:57,064
of the two. It's not angular, but it's spray
painted over this very angular body armor piece.

575
00:56:57,084 --> 00:57:01,968
Yeah, it's about a body armor. And it kind of
incorporates part of the shape of the body

576
00:57:02,028 --> 00:57:06,612
armor. That's what kind of forms the eyes of
the skull. Yeah. I think that's badass. I think

577
00:57:06,632 --> 00:57:11,416
this is the best looking version of the Punisher
to date, especially hands down the poster version

578
00:57:11,456 --> 00:57:15,707
where he's holding that minigun. with the big
bandolier bullets that's going through it.

579
00:57:15,727 --> 00:57:19,289
That's straight out of the comics. I was so
excited when I saw that. I cannot wait until

580
00:57:19,309 --> 00:57:24,372
the day that these characters show up in a Marvel
film. Although you know what I want? I just

581
00:57:24,392 --> 00:57:29,275
realized this the other day when I was driving
on my way to work. The Defenders show. What

582
00:57:29,395 --> 00:57:33,997
story arc are they gonna go with that? I have
no idea. You know what I want them to do? What?

583
00:57:34,038 --> 00:57:42,262
Secret war. The secret war where Nick Fury recruited
them to overthrow Latveria. Yeah, the Italian

584
00:57:42,342 --> 00:57:48,327
artist did that comic. Yeah, Gabriel D'Otto.
Yeah. I never read the comic, but I remember

585
00:57:48,347 --> 00:57:52,710
seeing the artwork for it. He's a phenomenal
painter. I think that's the way to incorporate

586
00:57:52,730 --> 00:57:56,672
them into the mainstream Marvel Universe if
they're not going to be in the Infinity War.

587
00:57:57,173 --> 00:58:01,396
I think if you do a smaller story with them
where Nick Fury shows up and he recruits the

588
00:58:01,416 --> 00:58:05,559
small band of people that most people don't
know of. They're kind of out of the public

589
00:58:05,639 --> 00:58:10,294
eye. Who was it? Black Widow Daredevil Punisher.
Oh, in the comic? Yeah. In the comic it was

590
00:58:10,334 --> 00:58:16,057
Wolverine, Spider-Man, Black Widow, Luke Cage,
Quake. Who the hell that is? Daisy Johnson,

591
00:58:16,097 --> 00:58:20,320
who's in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. She's the main
character. Oh, nice. That's a nice way to tie

592
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:25,382
in all the different properties. Yeah, I think
that would be fast. I've never heard that mentioned

593
00:58:25,423 --> 00:58:29,845
anywhere, but I think about these things. I'm
like, what a way to work. Well, what are you

594
00:58:29,865 --> 00:58:35,288
going to do after Infinity War? Well, my tie
into that is if they're not a part of Infinity

595
00:58:35,328 --> 00:58:40,191
War, because, you know, the budget or whatever.
I think that people will be like, well, how

596
00:58:40,211 --> 00:58:43,372
come these characters, the Netflix characters
aren't in the movie? And it's like, oh, because

597
00:58:43,392 --> 00:58:46,413
they're on their own secret mission that no
one's supposed to know about them. No one's

598
00:58:46,433 --> 00:58:50,495
supposed to know they exist. No one's supposed
to know about their mission. I think I think

599
00:58:50,515 --> 00:58:53,997
that's the way to do it. You'd have to do it
probably with a black widow, though. Right.

600
00:58:54,057 --> 00:58:57,738
Yeah, that's fine. I'm kind of like sad. If
it doesn't happen now, I'm going to be disappointed

601
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:02,760
because I feel like my idea was better. Anyway.
Well, I mean, how do you feel about the rift

602
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:07,742
between the cinematic universe and the television
universe? Like, are they even tied together

603
00:59:07,782 --> 00:59:11,684
anymore? They are tied together, yes. Because
they make direct references to things that

604
00:59:11,724 --> 00:59:15,926
happen in the films. But with the films, like,
I don't know if the films would ever use any

605
00:59:15,966 --> 00:59:19,667
of those characters. That's the question. If
they, I mean, if they ever did, it would have

606
00:59:19,687 --> 00:59:26,170
to be in a big, wide, massive crossover event,
which the Infinity War is. Yeah. So if they

607
00:59:26,190 --> 00:59:29,211
don't show up there, I don't know how, where
they would show up unless they eventually got

608
00:59:29,231 --> 00:59:33,973
their own film. If you really want to expand
your universe, I mean, and make like the biggest

609
00:59:34,053 --> 00:59:41,409
impact you possibly can. with spoilers when
Thanos will probably, should I say, I think

610
00:59:41,429 --> 00:59:46,912
we've said that in a previous podcast. Kills
half the universe. If you show someone like

611
00:59:47,312 --> 00:59:51,935
Charlie Cox's character sitting next to Alexia,
then all of a sudden, he disappears. It's a

612
00:59:51,955 --> 00:59:57,138
great way to pay some kind of tribute to people
who watch the shows. To have them show up in

613
00:59:57,178 --> 01:00:02,881
a film. Only to disappear at all. Yeah, but
I think even fans will appreciate that because...

614
01:00:03,222 --> 01:00:07,604
There were a lot of characters that disappeared
in the comic book story. Like I remember Hawkeye

615
01:00:07,624 --> 01:00:13,067
disappeared and Cersei, I think, was with him.
Although nobody knows. Very few people know

616
01:00:13,087 --> 01:00:18,490
who that is. And if you do, kudos. I don't know
who she is. She's a she's an eternal. I know

617
01:00:18,511 --> 01:00:23,854
who the DC Cersei is, but. Oh, yeah, that's
right. She's a Wonder Woman bad guy. Yeah.

618
01:00:24,514 --> 01:00:28,636
She'll be in the movie. I remember Mary Jane
died as part of the Infinity Gauntlet. There

619
01:00:28,656 --> 01:00:33,103
were a lot of people that disappeared. If they
go along that lines, I can see that working

620
01:00:33,143 --> 01:00:38,446
as well. Is that it for the news? I think that's
everything. I mean, there's a lot more, but

621
01:00:38,466 --> 01:00:42,708
we can't cover everything in the podcast. I
think that's all the big stuff. OK, all right.

622
01:00:42,928 --> 01:00:47,991
Well, as we mentioned at the beginning of the
podcast, we're doing a battle cast for repeating

623
01:00:48,111 --> 01:00:53,233
Black Widow against Black Canary. Should be
exciting. Yeah. Let's get into it. All right.

624
01:01:10,766 --> 01:01:17,269
Attention! Can you hear me? We come from the
future. We are interrupting this transmission.

625
01:01:17,609 --> 01:01:24,814
We are here to save you from shitty audio quality
and just really bad planning overall. I don't

626
01:01:24,834 --> 01:01:28,676
know. At first you sounded like an alien right
there, but you kind of saved it. Alright, so

627
01:01:28,736 --> 01:01:34,179
yeah, what we're doing here is we are going
back to some of these earlier episodes to redo

628
01:01:34,199 --> 01:01:40,763
some of the duels that were initially not very
well plotted. and it was not plotted at all.

629
01:01:40,823 --> 01:01:46,168
It was a different format and poor audio quality.
So we think you, the listeners, deserve better

630
01:01:46,288 --> 01:01:50,632
and also the characters deserve better than
what we initially did in the early days of

631
01:01:50,652 --> 01:01:54,816
this podcast. So we're gonna go ahead and redo
the duel between Black Canary and Black Widow.

632
01:01:55,056 --> 01:01:59,340
The way we do this on this podcast is we take
the characters and we provide you with the

633
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:04,785
history and powers behind each one. Then we
take their stats and run a thousand simulations

634
01:02:04,905 --> 01:02:10,299
using those numbers. and the Monte Carlo method
to sort of randomize them along a bell curve

635
01:02:10,399 --> 01:02:14,420
that accounts for all the variables that happen
in battle. Once we run the simulations, we

636
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:18,562
come back to you guys with a winner. Now we're
not going to go ahead and redo the results

637
01:02:18,602 --> 01:02:24,484
of this match, but we are going to provide you
with more in-depth backstories of the characters

638
01:02:24,624 --> 01:02:29,085
as well as go over our speculative scenario
on how we think a fight between the two would

639
01:02:29,125 --> 01:02:34,072
actually go. Our stats are based on the official
Marvel Power Rankings, from which we extrapolate

640
01:02:34,152 --> 01:02:38,936
the DC character stats and to which we also
incorporate a few additional stats that we

641
01:02:39,016 --> 01:02:44,079
think are important to these matches. Right,
right. Let's get started with the histories

642
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:48,802
of the characters. I think you go first with
Black Widow. Alrighty, so Black Widow is the

643
01:02:48,842 --> 01:02:53,606
perfect balance between superhero and spy, in
that she often goes up against larger-than-life

644
01:02:53,626 --> 01:02:58,369
villains and world-ending threats, but often
does so from the shadows, where she operates

645
01:02:58,449 --> 01:03:02,931
most effectively. I think her appeal mainly
lies in her ability to complete any mission,

646
01:03:03,071 --> 01:03:07,053
no matter how insurmountable the odds, as well
as her crossover potential between fantasy

647
01:03:07,093 --> 01:03:11,795
superhero stories and more grounded tales of
crime and espionage. Not much is known about

648
01:03:11,855 --> 01:03:17,817
Natalia Romanova's life prior to her recruitment
to the KGB as a young woman. As a child, she

649
01:03:17,857 --> 01:03:22,619
was an orphan raised by a Soviet soldier named
Ivan Petrovich, who trained her from an early

650
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:27,581
age in how to fight and defend herself. She
was a gifted athlete and scholar and gained

651
01:03:27,681 --> 01:03:33,156
recognition. by the Soviet government for her
skill as a dancer in the Russian Ballet. Shortly

652
01:03:33,236 --> 01:03:38,639
after World War II, she was drafted alongside
27 other young females into the covert Red

653
01:03:38,659 --> 01:03:44,603
Room facility, where she was arduously trained
in advanced combat and espionage. They psychologically

654
01:03:44,643 --> 01:03:49,326
manipulated the women into absolute obedience
and utter callousness for enemies of the state.

655
01:03:49,886 --> 01:03:53,808
They also chemically tampered with them through
a Soviet version of the Super Soldier Serum

656
01:03:54,168 --> 01:03:58,382
that would grant them longer lifespans. Which
is why although Natasha is around 80 years

657
01:03:58,482 --> 01:04:03,924
old, she only appears to be in her early 30s.
Dang! One of her trainers in the Red Room was

658
01:04:04,004 --> 01:04:09,485
James Bucky Barnes, who at that point was brainwashed
into the Winter Soldier. They shared a brief

659
01:04:09,525 --> 01:04:14,587
relationship before the KGB arranged for her
to be married to a Soviet test pilot, Alexei

660
01:04:14,627 --> 01:04:20,168
Shostakov. Though soon after, the government
stole Alexei away and told Natasha he was dead.

661
01:04:20,928 --> 01:04:25,369
In reality, they were preparing him to become
the Red Guardian, Russia's version of Captain

662
01:04:25,389 --> 01:04:31,476
America. In the grief over losing her husband,
Natasha dove into her KGB espionage missions

663
01:04:31,816 --> 01:04:37,019
and became known in intelligence circles as
the Black Widow. Her first mission to the United

664
01:04:37,059 --> 01:04:42,362
States was to locate and assassinate Anton Vanko,
also known as the Crimson Dynamo, an enemy

665
01:04:42,402 --> 01:04:47,685
of Iron Man who defected from the USSR. Iron
Man foiled her attempt and consistently stopped

666
01:04:47,705 --> 01:04:52,528
her schemes against him and Stark Industries.
She eventually encountered and recruited Hawkeye

667
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:57,154
in her fight against Tony Stark, and the two
fell in love. weakening her loyalty to her

668
01:04:57,194 --> 01:05:02,415
country when Hawkeye switched sides and joined
the Avengers superhero team. After the KGB

669
01:05:02,455 --> 01:05:07,457
tried to have Natasha gun down for wavering,
she also switched sides and fought alongside

670
01:05:07,477 --> 01:05:12,979
the Avengers as well. Although she was offered
membership to the team, she declined and was

671
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:18,780
instead convinced by Nick Fury to join the international
espionage organization known as SHIELD. She

672
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:23,001
was equipped with a new sleek black costume
and personalized equipment such as her bracelets.

673
01:05:23,522 --> 01:05:28,844
She helped S.H.I.E.L.D. gain intel on organizations
such as Hydra, The Hand, and even her old allies

674
01:05:28,904 --> 01:05:33,646
Communist Russia and China. Russia tried to
get her back on their side, through the revelation

675
01:05:33,666 --> 01:05:38,288
that her husband Alexei was still alive. However,
the offer turned out to be a ruse, and they

676
01:05:38,308 --> 01:05:42,749
tried to kill her again. She destroyed the Russian
intelligence headquarters and returned to the

677
01:05:42,849 --> 01:05:47,892
US to join the Avengers and even become the
team's leader alongside the Black Knight, after

678
01:05:47,952 --> 01:05:52,613
many of the original team disappeared after
the Onslaught Saga. When the heroes returned,

679
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:57,993
Natasha rejoined SHIELD. Later, while on a mission,
Natasha came into conflict with a Russian spy

680
01:05:58,013 --> 01:06:03,578
named Yelena Belova, who was also trained in
the Soviet Red Room. Natasha defeated Yelena,

681
01:06:03,758 --> 01:06:07,901
completed her mission, and brought her into
SHIELD custody. They swapped faces just like

682
01:06:07,921 --> 01:06:12,484
in the movie Face Off, and Natasha went undercover
as Yelena to stop a rogue Russian general from

683
01:06:12,564 --> 01:06:16,948
restarting the Cold War. Wait, is she the blonde
one? Like the short-haired blonde Russian spy?

684
01:06:16,968 --> 01:06:21,486
Yeah, yeah, Yelena is the short blonde-haired
black widow. A short while later, Natasha was

685
01:06:21,526 --> 01:06:25,827
nearly assassinated by the Russian government
who decided to eliminate all former Red Room

686
01:06:25,867 --> 01:06:30,309
spies. Her investigation into the matter led
her back to her old training facility where

687
01:06:30,329 --> 01:06:34,750
she learned that she and the 27 other young
women were implanted with false memories and

688
01:06:34,850 --> 01:06:40,332
chemically manipulated to follow orders through
pheromone-activated triggers. She also learned

689
01:06:40,372 --> 01:06:44,813
that Nick Fury knew about this and used this
control mechanism to get her to join SHIELD

690
01:06:44,893 --> 01:06:50,464
all those years ago. Pheromone Science was being
used by a modern cosmetics agency to manipulate

691
01:06:50,504 --> 01:06:55,207
women around the world, which Natasha put a
stop to by killing the Russian operative behind

692
01:06:55,227 --> 01:07:00,129
the conspiracy and the CEO of the cosmetics
company. She sided with Iron Man during the

693
01:07:00,169 --> 01:07:04,932
Civil War event and subsequently rejoined the
Avengers where she's mostly been since. Though

694
01:07:04,952 --> 01:07:09,055
she still often spies for S.H.I.E.L.D. and even
at one point assumed command of the organization,

695
01:07:09,155 --> 01:07:14,017
being the highest ranking agent present after
Nick Fury and Maria Hill were both incapacitated.

696
01:07:14,858 --> 01:07:19,239
As far as abilities go, Natasha is among the
top tier of martial artists in the Marvel Universe,

697
01:07:19,659 --> 01:07:24,280
alongside greats like Cat in America and Daredevil.
She is a master in multiple styles of fighting,

698
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:29,722
including Savat, Muay Thai, Judo, Ninjitsu,
and Kung Fu. Her biological enhancements grant

699
01:07:29,762 --> 01:07:35,163
her peak human physicality in terms of strength,
speed, agility, endurance, and durability.

700
01:07:35,503 --> 01:07:41,525
She is an experienced spy, tactician, hacker,
markswoman, and seductress. Her costume provides

701
01:07:41,585 --> 01:07:46,470
resistance to small arms fire, and allows her
to stick to walls via micro suction cups. Her

702
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:51,132
specialized bracelets contain a variety of weapons
and gadgets from which she can shoot grapple

703
01:07:51,152 --> 01:07:56,733
lines, gas pellets, and her signature weapon,
a blast of 30,000 volts of electricity called

704
01:07:56,753 --> 01:08:02,315
the Widow's Bite. On her person, she also often
carries combat knives, explosives, handguns,

705
01:08:02,695 --> 01:08:08,257
and occasionally a sniper rifle. That is a lot
of versatility. Yeah, it is. It's like an entire

706
01:08:08,337 --> 01:08:12,294
arsenal. Yeah, she's kind of like the female
Batman. Seems that way. That would actually

707
01:08:12,314 --> 01:08:16,515
be a really good fight, I think. Black Canary
used to carry like all those gadgets, but since

708
01:08:16,555 --> 01:08:21,517
then she really hasn't. She's relied more on
her fighting skill in general and her superpower,

709
01:08:21,877 --> 01:08:26,018
which I will get into. Sweet. Yeah, I don't
know too much about Black Canary. So I just

710
01:08:26,058 --> 01:08:30,359
always see her as the blonde DC black widow
with a sonic voice. I don't know. You have

711
01:08:30,379 --> 01:08:35,781
that turned around. No, I don't think so. All
right, so Black Canary in pre-New 52 continuity,

712
01:08:36,081 --> 01:08:42,433
Dina Laurel Lance. was the daughter of the Golden
Age crime fighter Dina Drake Lance, aka Black

713
01:08:42,453 --> 01:08:47,056
Canary. Wait, they have the same first name
and last name? Yeah, so Dina Laurel is like

714
01:08:47,076 --> 01:08:52,460
a mini, which is like the female version of
Junior. Dina Drake Lance, aka Black Canary,

715
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:57,864
was a member of the Justice Society of America.
The younger Dina was trained in fighting and

716
01:08:57,964 --> 01:09:02,987
acrobatics from a young age by her mother's
colleague, Ted Grant, a boxing champion and

717
01:09:03,027 --> 01:09:08,358
martial artist who fought crime as the hero
Wildcat. Dinah eventually grew into her mother's

718
01:09:08,398 --> 01:09:13,261
fishnet stockings and took up her mantle as
the new Black Canary against her mother's wishes.

719
01:09:13,761 --> 01:09:18,684
Having been born with a metagene that granted
her an ultrasonic scream known as the Canary

720
01:09:18,724 --> 01:09:23,267
Cry, Dinah quickly established herself as an
adept crime fighter in the streets of Gotham

721
01:09:23,307 --> 01:09:28,089
City and was one of the first members of the
Justice League of America, where she met her

722
01:09:28,129 --> 01:09:33,772
longtime romantic interest Oliver Queen, aka
Green Arrow, who you can learn more about in

723
01:09:33,812 --> 01:09:38,615
our Green Arrow vs Hawkeye episode. Dyna fought
alongside the Justice League for several years,

724
01:09:38,956 --> 01:09:44,479
advancing her martial arts skills by training
with heroes like Wonder Woman and Batman. Eventually,

725
01:09:44,539 --> 01:09:50,023
however, her mother died from cancer caused
by her earlier days fighting alien creatures

726
01:09:50,383 --> 01:09:54,967
with the Justice Society. And Dyna gave up her
crime-fighting career for a time to move to

727
01:09:55,007 --> 01:10:00,991
Seattle with Green Arrow and run a flower shop
called Sherwood Florist. During her time in

728
01:10:01,031 --> 01:10:05,878
Seattle, Dyna was kidnapped and tortured by
a drug dealer she had been investigating. she

729
01:10:05,918 --> 01:10:10,982
lost her canary cry, and the ability to have
children. Green Arrow killed that man that

730
01:10:11,042 --> 01:10:15,346
tortured her while she recovered in the hospital,
and he was with her as she went through counseling.

731
01:10:15,786 --> 01:10:21,732
Though traumatized by the event, she could nevertheless
not stop herself from interfering when innocents

732
01:10:21,752 --> 01:10:26,616
were in danger, and she resumed her crime-fighting
career, though it wasn't long before her and

733
01:10:26,676 --> 01:10:32,161
Oliver parted ways romantically. Eventually,
Dinah was contacted by Barbara Gordon, formerly

734
01:10:32,201 --> 01:10:38,092
Batgirl. but now the wheelchair-bound genius
hacker known as Oracle. The two formed a partnership

735
01:10:38,132 --> 01:10:43,135
that would become the covert superhero team
known as Birds of Prey. Throughout the team's

736
01:10:43,235 --> 01:10:49,118
many rosters, Dinah served as the lead field
agent, equipped with an array of gadgets, including

737
01:10:49,479 --> 01:10:54,782
Canary Cry bombs, that acted as a replacement
for her former power until one of their missions

738
01:10:54,802 --> 01:10:59,664
brought Dinah to a Lazarus pit, and its healing
properties restored her ultrasonic metahuman

739
01:10:59,684 --> 01:11:04,987
ability and the ability to have children. During
her time on the team, she also advanced her

740
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:09,051
martial arts skills by training with some of
the world's premier assassins and martial artists

741
01:11:09,351 --> 01:11:14,415
like Lady Shiva and Cassandra Cain. After training
with Lady Shiva, Black Canary quit the Birds

742
01:11:14,455 --> 01:11:20,160
of Prey to care for a young girl she adopted
from Asia named Sin, who beforehand was being

743
01:11:20,200 --> 01:11:26,045
groomed to be Lady Shiva's successor. She soon
rejoined the Justice League and was appointed

744
01:11:26,105 --> 01:11:28,286
its leader due to her strategic talents.

745
01:11:32,278 --> 01:11:36,581
and eventually the two were married, though
they separated after Oliver was found guilty

746
01:11:36,641 --> 01:11:41,726
of killing the villain Prometheus for destroying
his hometown of Star City. Dyna stepped down

747
01:11:41,746 --> 01:11:47,130
from her role in the Justice League and rejoined
the Birds of Prey. In post-New 52 continuity,

748
01:11:47,471 --> 01:11:52,815
there's only been one Black Canary, Dyna Drake,
who was a runaway orphan taken in and raised

749
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:59,221
by an ex-Special Forces agent and martial arts
sensei named Desmond Lamar. After he died from

750
01:11:59,281 --> 01:12:04,421
brain cancer, Dina became the new Sensei of
his dojo and was forced to defend it from street

751
01:12:04,441 --> 01:12:10,526
gangs seeking protection money and ninjas wanting
to take down the dojo. Though she failed to

752
01:12:10,586 --> 01:12:16,731
save the dojo, her talents were recognized by
a man named John Lynch, who recruited her into

753
01:12:16,771 --> 01:12:23,396
a covert special ops unit named Team 7, which
included Slade Wilson, who would later become

754
01:12:23,457 --> 01:12:31,619
Deathstroke, longtime Wonder Woman love interest
Steve Trevor, Amanda and Kurt Lance, whom Dyna

755
01:12:31,739 --> 01:12:37,243
would marry in secret. During her recruitment
to Team 7, Dyna had been secretly tested and

756
01:12:37,283 --> 01:12:42,466
found Medi-Gene positive, so Lynch put her in
the most difficult, dangerous missions in an

757
01:12:42,546 --> 01:12:48,511
effort to trigger her innate power. And it worked!
While on a mission to recover a powerful magical

758
01:12:48,571 --> 01:12:54,175
artifact known as Pandora's Box, she saw her
husband Kurt get shot, and she unleashed a

759
01:12:54,215 --> 01:13:01,271
canary cry equal in power to an array of to
the surprise of Lynch, who initially predicted

760
01:13:01,311 --> 01:13:06,435
her power to be akin to a sonic bullet. Her
scream destroyed the small island they were

761
01:13:06,475 --> 01:13:11,958
working on and seemingly killed her husband.
Team 7 disbanded after the incident and Dinah

762
01:13:11,998 --> 01:13:17,082
started her own crime-fighting team named Birds
of Prey, recruiting members such as Batgirl,

763
01:13:17,222 --> 01:13:22,225
Kitana, and Poison Ivy, though the team later
disbanded after it was revealed that Dinah

764
01:13:22,546 --> 01:13:28,309
was being manipulated behind the scenes by an
amnesiac Kurt Lance with ties to Amanda Waller.

765
01:13:29,014 --> 01:13:34,395
Dyna later joined a rock band named Black Canary
and fought crime as they toured the country.

766
01:13:34,755 --> 01:13:40,257
After which, she met Oliver Queen for the first
time, formed a relationship with him, and was

767
01:13:40,317 --> 01:13:46,318
recruited to the Justice League by Batman. Powers-wise,
Black Canary can use her voice to emit ultrasonic

768
01:13:46,378 --> 01:13:51,720
frequencies capable of disorienting foes or
shattering steel. She could also use it to

769
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:56,621
launch herself into the air by aiming her voice
toward the ground. Additionally- So, like Banshee,

770
01:13:56,661 --> 01:14:02,726
can she fly? It's more of like a glide. Additionally,
she's one of the most skilled martial artists

771
01:14:02,806 --> 01:14:09,191
on the planet, having mastered multiple forms
of martial arts, including Judo, Jujitsu, Taekwondo,

772
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:15,796
Wing Chun, Krav Maga, and Dragon-style Kung
Fu, to name a few. She's an agile acrobat and

773
01:14:15,857 --> 01:14:21,301
well-trained in weaponry, espionage, and tactical
analysis. Oh, that's Black Canary. It's always

774
01:14:21,321 --> 01:14:26,425
interesting hearing like both versions of their
origin, like both pre-New 52, post-New 52.

775
01:14:26,814 --> 01:14:30,735
All the post-New 52 stuff is eventually gonna
go away, right? Or what's gonna happen? Uh,

776
01:14:30,775 --> 01:14:35,237
no, I think they're being merged. Like, that's
essentially what happened with Superman. Both

777
01:14:35,257 --> 01:14:40,459
of his continuities have been merged. Like,
literally into one Superman. Oh, okay. Yeah.

778
01:14:40,499 --> 01:14:45,301
Personally, I prefer the New 52 origin for Black
Canary. It seems like she was more of a spy.

779
01:14:45,822 --> 01:14:50,505
in the new 52 universe with Team 7. Yeah, along
with like new characters like Slade Wilson

780
01:14:50,545 --> 01:14:54,348
and Amanda Waller. It's like, you know, those
are well-known characters in DC for being like

781
01:14:54,428 --> 01:14:57,891
spy characters. Yeah, as opposed to just, you
know, growing up as the daughter of a crime

782
01:14:57,911 --> 01:15:02,334
fighter and then, you know, going into her shoes.
Exactly. Yeah, exactly. So now that we've gone

783
01:15:02,354 --> 01:15:06,817
through their histories, we go ahead and speculate
on how we think a fight between the two characters

784
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:11,180
would go. The rules that we set out for the
match are that the characters start out about

785
01:15:11,221 --> 01:15:15,815
50 yards apart from each other. They don't know
anything about each other than that the other

786
01:15:15,875 --> 01:15:21,337
one is a threat that needs to be put down. Mm-hmm.
We also don't account for the environment.

787
01:15:21,657 --> 01:15:27,220
Or at least we like to speculate that this match
takes place in an environment that has no bearing

788
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:32,722
on the battle. Because environments can be too
variable. Right. And some characters can win

789
01:15:32,782 --> 01:15:38,384
in certain environments and not in others. Right,
the environment plays too much of a factor

790
01:15:38,404 --> 01:15:43,039
on the fight and we don't take stats for it,
so we just say. that it has no bearing on our

791
01:15:43,099 --> 01:15:47,662
speculation or the simulations that we run.
Right. So let's go ahead and start this match

792
01:15:47,762 --> 01:15:52,965
off. 50 yards apart. Who goes first? I'm gonna
say Black Widow's gonna go first with this

793
01:15:52,985 --> 01:15:57,068
because she's gonna have a sniper rifle. And
so right away she's gonna set up from 50 yards

794
01:15:57,168 --> 01:16:01,411
out, bring her gun up, and then start firing
off shots with her gun. Black Canary used to

795
01:16:01,431 --> 01:16:06,855
carry firearms back when she was a covert soldier,
but since she started her superhero career,

796
01:16:06,895 --> 01:16:10,757
she really doesn't do that anymore. She just,
you know, again, relies on her superpower.

797
01:16:11,234 --> 01:16:15,395
But she's no stranger to being shot at. You
know, like dodging bullets stuff. Yeah. As

798
01:16:15,415 --> 01:16:19,137
to what, you know, whether it's from other covert
organizations or from street crime. So she

799
01:16:19,177 --> 01:16:24,119
knows how to move in a way where she's not going
to be an easy target. Okay. And so she's moving

800
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:28,421
across the terrain. And she also uses her, her
Sonic screen pointed downward to sort of like

801
01:16:28,721 --> 01:16:32,463
launch herself into the air and kind of like
move faster that way. To become like a harder

802
01:16:32,503 --> 01:16:37,445
target. Yeah. Okay. So she closes the distance
between her and Black Widow. Right. Okay. So

803
01:16:37,645 --> 01:16:41,638
they get in close and they start their fight.
Black Widow is still holding the sniper rifle,

804
01:16:41,678 --> 01:16:45,019
so she's kind of like fighting with that, almost
kind of like a bow staff kind of weapon. Uh

805
01:16:45,039 --> 01:16:51,081
huh. Okay, so yeah, they're fighting, but Black
Canary manages to grapple the rifle away from

806
01:16:51,121 --> 01:16:55,902
Black Widow, and then aim it at her, and fire
off a few rounds. Okay, so she takes the gun

807
01:16:55,942 --> 01:17:00,384
from her, Black Widow does like a few backflips
to dodge these rifle bullets, and fires her

808
01:17:00,424 --> 01:17:06,745
widows by at Black Canary to kind of stun her
arm to drop the gun. Okay. She drops her gun.

809
01:17:07,118 --> 01:17:11,521
And that's when she just fires off her canary
cry. Can't make her drop that. So the canary

810
01:17:11,561 --> 01:17:15,884
cry, is it gonna hurt Black Widow's ears or
is it gonna hit her like a car or something

811
01:17:15,904 --> 01:17:20,827
like that? It's a disorienting cry. So it's
like a low frequency canary cry just to incapacitate

812
01:17:20,847 --> 01:17:24,490
Black Widow. Just to start off? So they're both
kind of stunned from their respective abilities

813
01:17:24,530 --> 01:17:29,854
kind of. Black Canary from her widow's bite
and Black Widow from the canary cry. So at

814
01:17:29,874 --> 01:17:33,936
that point, Black Widow, I think she has more
stamina than Black Canary because she's undergone

815
01:17:33,956 --> 01:17:38,755
those chemical experiments. So she shrugs off
the canary cry pretty quick and she pulls out

816
01:17:38,775 --> 01:17:42,716
a pair of handguns and she starts shooting towards
a black canary with the handguns. So black

817
01:17:42,736 --> 01:17:46,678
canary fires off another canary cry that warps
the medium that the bullets are traveling in

818
01:17:46,718 --> 01:17:51,640
so they go off course. Oh really she can do
that. Yeah, she can sonically force bullets

819
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:56,722
off course. So the guns are pretty much useless.
Together, you're- I don't know she could do

820
01:17:56,742 --> 01:18:00,604
that. She could do a lot of stuff. It's a pretty
versatile power. All right, so black widow

821
01:18:00,644 --> 01:18:03,445
also has to deal with the oncoming waves that
are going toward her as she's shooting the

822
01:18:03,505 --> 01:18:08,356
gun toward a black canary. So Black Widow does
a cartwheel out of the range of the Canary

823
01:18:08,376 --> 01:18:12,879
Cry, and at which point she closes the distance
again with a flying kick, and like wraps her

824
01:18:12,919 --> 01:18:17,603
legs around Black Canary. Yes, she does. And
like spins around and like throws her through

825
01:18:17,623 --> 01:18:21,726
the air onto the ground. OK, well, Black Canary
just kind of rolls out of it and presses her

826
01:18:21,766 --> 01:18:25,609
own martial arts attack. So they're going to
get it hand to hand again. OK, I can see like

827
01:18:25,629 --> 01:18:29,511
Black Widow is trying to stun her again with
her widow's bite, but Black Canary already

828
01:18:29,632 --> 01:18:33,162
being aware of its existence, keeps like moving
her arm and stuff and. And I could also see

829
01:18:33,462 --> 01:18:37,566
Black Canary trying to use her Canary Cry at
close range, but Black Widow keeps attacking

830
01:18:37,586 --> 01:18:41,429
her from behind and grabs her in a chokehold
from behind so that she can't use her voice.

831
01:18:41,629 --> 01:18:46,133
Okay, well that's when Black Canary just aims
her Canary Cry downward and launches them both

832
01:18:46,173 --> 01:18:51,278
straight into the air. Oh yikes. How are they
gonna get out of that? Well Black Canary can

833
01:18:51,438 --> 01:18:57,023
definitely just fire another blast down to land
softly. So as they're in the air, Black Canary

834
01:18:57,423 --> 01:19:02,222
lifts Black Widow over her and throws her down
to the ground. Oh man. Alright, so Black Widow

835
01:19:02,242 --> 01:19:05,523
is falling toward the ground and I assume that
Black Canary is kind of like slowly gliding

836
01:19:05,823 --> 01:19:09,184
down toward the ground with her Canary Cry.
Right. At the very last second she like shoots

837
01:19:09,204 --> 01:19:13,565
a grapple line that wraps around Black Canary's,
I guess, ankle or something like that. Uh huh.

838
01:19:13,745 --> 01:19:17,346
And like lowers herself gently to the ground
so that, you know, she doesn't splatter. But

839
01:19:17,446 --> 01:19:22,388
with that cable line attached to her leg, Black
Widow yanks Black Canary out of the sky and

840
01:19:22,428 --> 01:19:26,769
slams her into the ground. Okay, but not like
hard because, you know, she just has her Canary

841
01:19:26,789 --> 01:19:31,859
Cry to lessen the impact. Right. Okay. So they're
both on the ground now except now Black Widow

842
01:19:32,259 --> 01:19:36,943
has Black Canary by a grapple line. And so with
Black Canary somewhat restricted like that,

843
01:19:37,483 --> 01:19:41,866
Black Widow shoots a tear gas pellet into her
general vicinity. Does she need a gun to do

844
01:19:41,886 --> 01:19:46,089
that or does it fire from her bracelet? It fires
from her bracelets. Okay. Yeah. So now Black

845
01:19:46,109 --> 01:19:50,772
Canary is on the ground, wrapped with a cable
around her ankle, and surrounded by tear gas.

846
01:19:51,372 --> 01:19:56,156
Okay, well again, Black Canary's had special
forces training so I'm sure she's been in that

847
01:19:56,196 --> 01:19:59,982
kind of training situation before where she's
had to endure tear gas. She kind of like holds

848
01:20:00,002 --> 01:20:05,227
her breath and like unwraps her leg from the
cable and then she leaps out of the gas In

849
01:20:05,287 --> 01:20:10,431
a like a handspring front flip flying kick towards
Black Widow real quick to close the gap All

850
01:20:10,451 --> 01:20:14,054
right, so they're back to hand-to-hand combat
at this point Yeah, but Black Widow pulls out

851
01:20:14,074 --> 01:20:18,738
like one of her knives and straight-up stabs
Black Canary this time. No Black Canary isn't

852
01:20:18,758 --> 01:20:24,743
the most well armored of superheroes. The knife
thing is hard. I wouldn't say she gets stabbed

853
01:20:24,823 --> 01:20:29,822
Maybe she gets like sliced a little bit. Okay
But yeah, I mean that just comes with the territory

854
01:20:29,842 --> 01:20:33,925
of hand-to-hand fighting with someone with a
knife. So Black Canary is sliced a little bit,

855
01:20:34,005 --> 01:20:39,788
it kind of like slows her down just a little
bit, at which point Black Widow straps a explosive

856
01:20:39,828 --> 01:20:45,751
sticky bomb to her back, then- What?! Kicks
off of her, does a few black hand springs as

857
01:20:45,791 --> 01:20:50,114
the explosive goes off, and kills Black Canary.
Okay, but she's wearing a leather jacket. Okay.

858
01:20:50,134 --> 01:20:54,296
So, as she hears the beeping like about to go
off, she takes off the leather jacket and throws

859
01:20:54,336 --> 01:20:59,178
it towards Black Widow. Hehehehe. And to top
it off- She unleashes like a freight train

860
01:20:59,218 --> 01:21:03,499
of a sonic scream towards Black Widow. Okay,
so Black Widow is gonna suffer the bomb explosion

861
01:21:03,699 --> 01:21:07,240
and the canary cry? Right. Except that I say
that Black Canary didn't get the jacket off

862
01:21:07,260 --> 01:21:11,822
in time and it blows up before she could actually
throw it. Agree to disagree. Alright, let's

863
01:21:11,842 --> 01:21:15,843
go ahead and take it to the stats. So we're
gonna go ahead and go back to the future and

864
01:21:15,903 --> 01:21:20,584
leave you guys with the original results of
this match so you can find out who exactly

865
01:21:20,624 --> 01:21:28,799
got out of this situation alive. Awesome. See
you guys. Anyway, let's take it to the computer

866
01:21:28,819 --> 01:21:40,510
show. Let's run the figures. All right. The
fuck was there a duck in the simulation runner?

867
01:21:42,371 --> 01:21:48,717
I don't know how the machine works, man. Sometimes
ducks run there. So the results are in. And

868
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:54,074
looking at the risk solver add-on, it's going
to be really close. I know that. It is very

869
01:21:54,114 --> 01:22:01,219
close. It's 52.3, which makes this the closest
battle that we've had yet. How is there ever

870
01:22:01,239 --> 01:22:05,122
going to be a closer battle than that after
a thousand simulations? Well, here's the thing.

871
01:22:05,142 --> 01:22:09,406
When I was putting in the numbers, I ran an
average of all the stats, and they came out

872
01:22:09,426 --> 01:22:14,470
to the same number, actually. I'm not surprised.
So, I mean, random numbers are generated between

873
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:19,233
a standard deviation of that stat number. But
if you just average the base of what we put

874
01:22:19,273 --> 01:22:24,561
in... the average came out the same. So essentially,
they're as equally powerful. So if we were

875
01:22:24,581 --> 01:22:30,125
to run the simulation again, it's possible that
Black Canary would come out on top. Wait, so

876
01:22:30,165 --> 01:22:36,249
Black Widow came out on top. Black Widow did
win. By 52%. Yeah, she won 52.3% of the 1,000

877
01:22:36,690 --> 01:22:43,835
simulations. So we're taking that as the truth.
What the heck? As gospel. That is what happened,

878
01:22:44,115 --> 01:22:49,795
and that's what we're sticking to. So in your
face. Whatever, that's not, that is not in

879
01:22:49,815 --> 01:22:54,138
your face. I'm not running the simulations again.
That was, it's pretty much a coin toss. So

880
01:22:54,158 --> 01:22:59,721
close, it is a coin toss. Wow, will we ever
have a match that close again? Probably, but

881
01:22:59,761 --> 01:23:04,705
we'll see. It would have to be like Hyperion
and Superman or something, I don't know. Just

882
01:23:04,725 --> 01:23:10,088
people that are clones of each other. Yeah,
clones. I mean, they're sort of clones. I thought

883
01:23:10,148 --> 01:23:15,112
her canary kite would have put her out on top,
but it's probably the lethality of Black Widow.

884
01:23:15,612 --> 01:23:20,880
It's not the lethality, it's the... Let me look
at the stats again. Yeah, Black Canary certainly

885
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:27,706
ranked higher in projectile damage, but Black
Widow's Edge was in, she was slightly smarter

886
01:23:28,026 --> 01:23:34,392
and had a greater accuracy at long range. Oh,
that's, when I say accuracy, I mean marksmanship.

887
01:23:34,832 --> 01:23:39,116
Because Black Canary doesn't use guns. She always
uses Oracle, and Black Widow is kind of her

888
01:23:39,236 --> 01:23:43,840
own Oracle. She's like a master hacker and she's
super smart. She led the Avengers, she's good

889
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:49,316
at tactics, things like that. Black Canary,
while she's had a leadership role before, I

890
01:23:49,336 --> 01:23:55,300
don't think it's quite to the same extent. No,
no. So there you have it. That was a good match,

891
01:23:55,320 --> 01:24:00,904
holy cow. That was pretty good. So if you're
keeping tabs at home, Marvel is up two one.

892
01:24:01,585 --> 01:24:07,869
That's like a split down the middle win. So
it was like 1.5 versus 1.5. Technically this

893
01:24:07,909 --> 01:24:12,413
one goes in the Marvel books and we'll see what
happens the next time. So next podcast. Next

894
01:24:12,433 --> 01:24:20,485
podcast in two weeks. we are going to be reviewing
Batman v Superman. Are you nervous? No, I'm

895
01:24:20,665 --> 01:24:27,048
so excited. I just, uh, I'm nervous for you.
You know, I can't believe it's only two weeks

896
01:24:27,088 --> 01:24:31,150
away. It's coming up soon. It's going to be
a really long two weeks. Kick off to the DC

897
01:24:31,190 --> 01:24:34,672
Extended Universe. It'll be exciting. Yeah.
Well, we'll join us for that. Definitely tune

898
01:24:34,692 --> 01:24:39,294
in on the next podcast. Looking forward to it.
Yeah, totally. All right. Without further ado,

899
01:24:39,794 --> 01:24:41,275
up, up and away. True believers.
