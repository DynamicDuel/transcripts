8
00:01:16,174 --> 00:01:20,035
Hey and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

9
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:25,336
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based

10
00:01:25,476 --> 00:01:31,518
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother Johnny DC. And in this episode,

11
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:37,380
we are going to find out who would win in a
fight between the DC villain Copperhead and

12
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,341
the Marvel villain Scorpion. I was gonna say
that this is like a lizard-themed duel, but

13
00:01:42,641 --> 00:01:47,803
uh... Yeah, only one of these guys are reptile
themed. Of course, Scorpion is an insect. So

14
00:01:48,403 --> 00:01:53,724
I had kind of a brain fart right there. Actually,
scorpions aren't insects. They're arachnids.

15
00:01:53,785 --> 00:01:57,746
Fuck you, Jonathan. It was right off the gate.
You're stupid. You're going down. I hope you

16
00:01:57,786 --> 00:02:04,447
lose this match now. Don't correct me. It disgusts
me. Anyway, Jonathan and I are recording this

17
00:02:04,487 --> 00:02:08,829
episode a little bit early. We're actually recording
this the week before Thanksgiving. And this

18
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:14,111
episode is actually coming out the week after
Thanksgiving. Initially, this episode was going

19
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:19,594
to be a review of Watchmen Chapter 2, but we
got a lot of stuff going on during the Thanksgiving

20
00:02:19,634 --> 00:02:24,636
week. So we decided to put this episode out
now and next week we're going to be reviewing

21
00:02:24,716 --> 00:02:29,659
Watchmen Chapter 2. Yeah, we had Thanksgiving.
I have a work trip. It's just a lot of stuff

22
00:02:29,679 --> 00:02:36,122
going on. Plus it gives me, you know, more time
to sit with my thoughts after watching Watchmen

23
00:02:36,142 --> 00:02:39,604
Chapter 2, which I have not done yet because
it's not out. Please bear with us because this

24
00:02:39,644 --> 00:02:44,203
is actually a pretty bare-boned show. We're
not gonna have a no price segment. We're not

25
00:02:44,243 --> 00:02:50,126
going to have any news. We're just gonna get
right into the duel. Right, but first we do

26
00:02:50,186 --> 00:02:55,029
have to hear from our artificially intelligent
duel simulator, AJ9K, who has a quick message

27

out of the way, let's go ahead and get on to

42
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:18,973
the main event where we find out who would win
in a fight between Copperhead and Scorpion.

43
00:04:34,102 --> 00:04:39,524
All right, Copperhead versus Scorpion. This
episode is coming out in lead up to the upcoming

44
00:04:39,604 --> 00:04:43,586
Craven the Hunter movie that's coming out in
a few weeks. Of course, that film will be based

45
00:04:43,626 --> 00:04:47,228
off of the Spider-Man villain known as Craven
the Hunter, but we've already done a duel episode

46
00:04:47,248 --> 00:04:53,831
with Craven. We pit him against DC's Vixen.
So we were thinking of another Spider-Man villain

47
00:04:53,871 --> 00:04:58,593
to do a duel episode with, and actually my favorite
Spider-Man villain of all time is Scorpion.

48
00:04:59,142 --> 00:05:03,043
And it is a damn shame that we have not gotten
to a duel episode with him yet. So we're going

49
00:05:03,063 --> 00:05:09,186
to fix that right now. Pitting Scorpion against
Copperhead, who was not an easy foe to come

50
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:14,628
up with. Took us a while to settle on Copperhead,
us and the executive producers. But essentially,

51
00:05:14,668 --> 00:05:19,510
these guys are incredibly agile. They're strong
and in part, they're gifted that strength thanks

52
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:25,332
to the suits that they wear, which include these
long tails that can wrap people up. One guy

53
00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:30,975
uses acid attacks. Another guy uses venom based
attacks. It was actually a hard sell once we

54
00:05:31,075 --> 00:05:36,679
realized Copperhead could work. Yeah, I think
I primarily know Copperhead from the Suicide

55
00:05:36,699 --> 00:05:42,004
Squad Hell to Pay animated movie in which he
was a member of the Suicide Squad team. And

56
00:05:42,044 --> 00:05:47,568
he was pretty cool. He was like a cyborg with
like snake-like powers in that film. I'm assuming

57
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:52,652
that's what he's like in the comics. Not quite.
Well, we will find out all about him and Scorpion.

58
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:58,657
You know what's crazy is that I feel like Copperhead
has been better represented in the medium of

59
00:05:58,697 --> 00:06:03,681
film than Scorpion has. Scorpion, again, my
favorite Spider-Man villain, has yet to make

60
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:08,685
an appearance in the films besides that stupid
cameo that was in Spider-Man Homecoming. I

61
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:13,850
think prominently he was best featured in Spider-Man
Into the Spider-Verse, although that was the

62
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:18,834
ultimate version of Scorpion. Copperhead wasn't
in any films either except for Hell to Pay.

63
00:06:19,315 --> 00:06:23,882
Oh, he was also in a video game, although it
was the girl version of him. in Arkham Origins

64
00:06:23,922 --> 00:06:28,886
and that was awesome. That was really cool.
Well, I mean, Scorpion's been in a lot of Spider-Man

65
00:06:28,906 --> 00:06:33,070
video games, so I guess he has that going for
him. Can't wait to see who's gonna win this

66
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:37,433
fight, but to explain the methodology behind
our duels, let's go to our sentient duel simulator,

67
00:06:37,614 --> 00:06:42,798
Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K, tell our listeners
how you go about determining a winner in our

68
00:06:42,838 --> 00:06:47,922
duel matchups. Yes, of course, sir. The way
I determine a winner between the contestants

69
00:06:47,962 --> 00:06:53,346
is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations using
the characters' statistics. The Monte Carlo

70
00:06:53,366 --> 00:06:57,650
simulation is a probabilistic model used to
determine outcomes through random sampling.

71
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,994
In this case, I randomised the statistics along
a normal distribution as a way to simulate

72
00:07:03,034 --> 00:07:07,618
the many variables that can occur during battle.
The stat parameters are based on the official

73
00:07:07,678 --> 00:07:12,983
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters'
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat

74
00:07:13,023 --> 00:07:18,547
categories are included such as range, damage
potential, versatility and perception in order

75
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:23,975
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.
The results of the 1,000 simulations provide

76
00:07:23,995 --> 00:07:28,377
a percentage of wins for each character. The
contestant with the higher percentage is declared

77
00:07:28,397 --> 00:07:33,700
the victor, as they have a higher probability
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,

78
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,883
neither character should win 100% of the matches.
The comic book stories have shown that there's

79
00:07:39,023 --> 00:07:43,826
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so
the confidence rate of my method falls in line

80
00:07:43,846 --> 00:07:48,448
with the precedents that have been established
in the source material. My mathematical simulations

81
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:53,611
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes

82
00:07:53,671 --> 00:07:59,775
tabulated for determination of the winner. Thanks,
A.J. 9K. Before we run the simulations, though,

83
00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:04,458
we like to break down each character's histories
and abilities before improvising a scenario

84
00:08:04,538 --> 00:08:10,462
on how we imagine one of the 1,000 simulations
would play out beat for beat. And I believe

85
00:08:10,482 --> 00:08:14,224
it's my turn to go first with the Marvel characters
backstory, so let me go ahead and tell you

86
00:08:14,304 --> 00:08:21,095
all about Scorpion. McDonald Mac Gargan's early
life is shrouded in mystery, but he eventually

87
00:08:21,115 --> 00:08:25,557
became a private investigator known for his
willingness to take on difficult and morally

88
00:08:25,597 --> 00:08:30,880
questionable jobs. This reputation drew the
attention of Daily Bugle publisher J. Jonah

89
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:36,302
Jameson, who was determined to reveal how Peter
Parker consistently captured such astonishing

90
00:08:36,322 --> 00:08:40,103
photographs of Spider-Man, whom you could learn
more about in his duel against Blue Beetle.

91
00:08:40,564 --> 00:08:45,758
Jameson hired Gargan to shadow Parker, hoping
to uncover a secret connection. However, Peter

92
00:08:45,798 --> 00:08:50,641
Parker's spider sense alerted him to Gargan's
presence each time, leaving Jameson frustrated

93
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:56,185
and ready to pursue a bolder strategy. Jameson
arranged for Gargan to undergo a risky procedure

94
00:08:56,205 --> 00:09:01,989
with Dr. Farley Stillwell, a scientist exploring
genetic manipulation. In exchange for a $10,000

95
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:08,554
fee, Gargan agreed to become Stillwell's first
human test subject. His DNA was fused with

96
00:09:08,614 --> 00:09:15,430
that of a scorpion, one of a spider's natural
predators, granting endurance and reflexes.

97
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:21,092
Stillwell also outfitted Gargan with a cybernetically
controlled mechanical tail, completing his

98
00:09:21,113 --> 00:09:26,075
transformation into Scorpion. But while the
experiment made Gargan physically formidable,

99
00:09:26,535 --> 00:09:31,537
it also had unforeseen mental consequences,
driving him toward insanity and sparking a

100
00:09:31,597 --> 00:09:36,999
deep-seated aggression that he would later be
unable to control. Initially, Gargan reveled

101
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,921
in his new powers, believing they made him invincible.
His first encounters with Spider-Man reinforced

102
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:47,787
this confidence, as he defeated the webslinger
twice. However as Gargan's powers grew, so

103
00:09:47,827 --> 00:09:53,589
did his hatred toward Jameson, whom he now saw
as the true architect of his monstrous transformation.

104
00:09:53,989 --> 00:09:59,050
This contempt soon became an obsession, leading
Scorpion to attack Jameson at the Daily Bugle,

105
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:04,792
only to be foiled by Spider-Man in their third
battle. Despite being arrested, Gargan's animosity

106
00:10:04,832 --> 00:10:09,853
toward Jameson, whom he saw as both his creator
and his enemy, would remain a driving force

107
00:10:09,893 --> 00:10:15,419
for years to come. Over time, Gargan's animosity
turned him into a hardened mercenary, accepting

108
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:19,720
dangerous assignments that often brought him
into conflict with other heroes. As Gargan's

109
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,781
criminal career advanced, he became part of
the Masters of Evil supervillain team under

110
00:10:23,941 --> 00:10:28,682
Egghead, joining forces to battle the Avengers,
though they were ultimately defeated. You can

111
00:10:28,722 --> 00:10:33,584
learn more about the Masters of Evil in their
duel episode against the Legion of Doom. Gargan's

112
00:10:33,604 --> 00:10:38,205
reputation for brutality grew, making him a
reliable go-to for villains who needed muscle

113
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:43,524
for their operations. Yet he remained haunted
by the life he had lost and the monstrous identity

114
00:10:43,564 --> 00:10:48,448
he was now trapped in, leading him to believe
he can never remove his costume. Desperate

115
00:10:48,508 --> 00:10:53,571
and mentally unstable, Scorpion attempted to
subject Jameson to an acid bath, a scheme foiled

116
00:10:53,591 --> 00:10:58,855
by Captain Marvel, who threw Gargan into the
acid herself. Horribly burned and in agony,

117
00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:04,279
Gargan retreated into the sewers, his sanity
slipping further. He would spend weeks in isolation,

118
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:09,874
spiraling deep into madness and becoming convinced
he was truly a monster. This self-loathing

119
00:11:09,934 --> 00:11:14,275
and paranoia haunted him until another confrontation
with Spider-Man revealed that his monstrous

120
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:19,077
identity was more of a psychological prison
than a physical one. In a bid to regain his

121
00:11:19,097 --> 00:11:23,499
sense of control, Gargan accepted offers from
corporate backers like Justin Hammer, who saw

122
00:11:23,559 --> 00:11:29,041
value in enhancing Scorpion's deadly abilities.
Hammer outfitted him with a new suit and extended

123
00:11:29,081 --> 00:11:34,599
his tail, equipping it with advanced weaponry.
but Gargan's volatility proved disastrous as

124
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,763
he repeatedly jeopardized Hammer's operations
with his inability to follow orders. Despite

125
00:11:39,803 --> 00:11:44,306
these setbacks, Gargan continued to cling to
his criminal career, unable to give up his

126
00:11:44,326 --> 00:11:48,909
vendetta against Jameson and Spider-Man. In
one of his most significant turning points,

127
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,713
Gargan was approached by Norman Osborn, who
sought to harness Gargan's hatred for Spider-Man.

128
00:11:54,233 --> 00:12:00,217
Osborn, aka the Green Goblin, now aware of Spider-Man's
true identity, offered Gargan an upgraded suit.

129
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:06,353
and revealed Parker's secret to him. He instructed
Gargan to kidnap Peter's Aunt May if Osborn

130
00:12:06,373 --> 00:12:11,476
was ever incarcerated. Gargan nearly completed
his mission when he encountered the Venom symbiote,

131
00:12:11,616 --> 00:12:16,539
which offered him even greater power, becoming
the new monstrous Venom, whom you can learn

132
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,642
more about in our Clayface versus Venom duel
episode. As Venom, Gargan discovered newfound

133
00:12:21,702 --> 00:12:27,505
powers, joining Osborn's Sinister 12 in a bid
to destroy Spider-Man. Though he was defeated,

134
00:12:27,886 --> 00:12:32,528
Gargan enjoyed the raw powers the symbiote offered.
However, controlling the symbiote came at a

135
00:12:32,588 --> 00:12:38,351
cost as his bloodlust drove Gargan to increasingly
savage acts. Concerned with his violent tendencies,

136
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:43,514
the government implanted electrical inhibitors
in Gargan's body, hoping to restrain the symbiote's

137
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:48,577
influence. Following the Skrull invasion, Osborn
elevated Gargan's status by assigning him to

138
00:12:48,637 --> 00:12:53,840
the Dark Avengers, where he took on the public
persona of Spider-Man to present a twisted

139
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:58,931
reflection of the hero to the public. His hatred
for Jameson? Now New York's mayor led him to

140
00:12:58,991 --> 00:13:04,756
orchestrate a gang war aimed at tarnishing Jameson's
reputation, plunging the city into chaos. When

141
00:13:04,836 --> 00:13:09,379
Osborn's empire finally fell during the Siege
of Asgard, Gargan and the other Dark Avengers

142
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:14,804
were arrested, and the symbiote was forcibly
removed. Without it, Gargan experienced severe

143
00:13:14,864 --> 00:13:19,448
health repercussions, his body having grown
dependent on the symbiote for stability. His

144
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:24,211
freedom came when Alastor Smythe, a villain
known as the Spider Slayer, broke him out of

145
00:13:24,251 --> 00:13:28,870
prison and outfitted him with an advanced scorpion
suit. which included a life support system

146
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:34,912
and a quote-unquote scorpion sense similar to
Spider-Man's spider sense. Smite's intervention

147
00:13:34,952 --> 00:13:39,973
provided Gargan with a semblance of normalcy,
but it also rekindled his obsession with revenge.

148
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:45,114
Together, the two staged a high-profile attack
on Jameson and his family, though Spider-Man

149
00:13:45,214 --> 00:13:50,396
ultimately thwarted their plans. His ongoing
vendetta against Venom resurfaced after Eddie

150
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,996
Brock reclaimed the symbiote.

151
00:13:56,546 --> 00:14:03,128
Gargan adopted a new identity, Virus, and acquired
a heavily weaponized suit. He pursued Venom

152
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:07,970
relentlessly, but was ultimately captured by
Codex, a symbiote hive ruler who forced him

153
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:13,212
to resume his Scorpion identity. Gargan eventually
accepted a position on the government-run symbiote

154
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:19,175
task force, targeting rogue symbiotes in a twisted
attempt at redemption. Powers-wise, Scorpion

155
00:14:19,195 --> 00:14:24,857
is a mutate with Scorpion-human hybrid physiology.
This grants him superhuman strength, able to

156
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:30,167
lift around 20 tons. and enhanced running speed
around 50 miles per hour. His scorpion suit

157
00:14:30,187 --> 00:14:34,748
grants him enhanced durability that renders
him bulletproof to small arms fire and he's

158
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:39,609
equipped with pincers and the gloves that allow
him to grasp onto walls and rip through solid

159
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:44,531
metal. Best of all though is his 10 foot long
mechanical tail that can whip at 100 miles

160
00:14:44,571 --> 00:14:49,852
per hour and is dexterous enough to carry objects
or use as a springboard to launch himself three

161
00:14:49,892 --> 00:14:55,026
stories into the air. The tip of his tail is
equipped with a poisonous barb. and from it

162
00:14:55,086 --> 00:15:00,271
he can fire both laser blasts and corrosive
acid. While Scorpion is not a trained fighter,

163
00:15:00,711 --> 00:15:06,336
he is an adept brawler and a gifted investigator.
That's Scorpion. Wait so you're telling me

164
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:12,701
I can get a suit like the Scorpion for just
10 G's? Not only a suit but also Scorpion DNA.

165
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:19,147
Eh it doesn't matter I don't have that anyway.
A guy could dream though, although I'm not

166
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:24,015
sure how much it costs to get Copperhead's suit.
But I would say it's even more oppressive than

167
00:15:24,075 --> 00:15:28,659
Scorpion's and probably more expensive. Probably.
Well, I mean, Scorpion debuted in the 1960s,

168
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:36,305
so $10,000 in the 1960s now, it's got to be
at least $10 billion. Oh, Copperhead also appeared

169
00:15:36,345 --> 00:15:41,789
in the 60s, the late 60s. Interesting. Let me
get into his backstory. The criminal known

170
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:47,474
as Copperhead first emerged in Gotham City as
a mysterious figure whose agility, stealth,

171
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:53,686
and cunning allowed him to execute a series
of audacious thefts. His costume, resembling

172
00:15:53,806 --> 00:15:58,609
a snake's scales, included a prehensile tail
that he could use to bind an incapacity to

173
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:04,351
his victims, earning him the moniker Copperhead.
Though his true identity remained a mystery,

174
00:16:04,711 --> 00:16:10,874
his modus operandi was distinct, striking swiftly
and vanishing without a trace. Copperhead's

175
00:16:10,894 --> 00:16:16,717
contortionist skills and snake-like agility
made him nearly impossible to apprehend, confounding

176
00:16:16,837 --> 00:16:22,885
Gotham's police force. Copperhead's first major
heist involved the theft of a tiara belonging

177
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:28,970
to a foreign dignitary visiting Gotham City.
Disguised as an elderly man, Copperhead infiltrated

178
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:34,515
the dignitary's heavily guarded quarters, stealing
the tiara before escaping into the shadows.

179
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:40,039
His theft drew the attention of Batman, who
enlisted the help of Batgirl and Wonder Woman

180
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,844
to help capture the slippery villain. The trio
set a trap for Copperhead using the golden

181
00:16:45,884 --> 00:16:52,039
cask of Montezuma. a priceless artifact as bait.
Though Copperhead failed in his attempt to

182
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,902
steal it, the trap failed as well, and he successfully
evaded the heroes once again, disappearing

183
00:16:57,982 --> 00:17:03,384
into Gotham's underworld. Shortly after, Copperhead
captured Wonder Woman during an encounter in

184
00:17:03,444 --> 00:17:08,586
Gotham Park and brought her back to his lair.
Batman and Batgirl were able to track him,

185
00:17:08,626 --> 00:17:13,949
however, to his hideout where they managed to
capture and arrest him. After escaping from

186
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:18,554
prison, Copperhead upgraded his suit. with help
from the Secret Society of Super-Villains,

187
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:24,537
who invited him to join their ranks. While working
for the Society, he collaborated with villains

188
00:17:24,557 --> 00:17:29,879
like Gorilla Grodd and Star Sapphire on a series
of heists, the former of which you can learn

189
00:17:29,939 --> 00:17:34,561
more about in our Gorilla Grodd vs. Psylocke
duel episode. Internal conflicts within the

190
00:17:34,581 --> 00:17:39,383
group, however, led Copperhead to abandon his
associates after becoming suspicious of the

191
00:17:39,443 --> 00:17:44,745
Society's leadership. As a freelance assassin,
Copperhead expanded his criminal endeavors

192
00:17:44,805 --> 00:17:50,123
internationally. He was hired to assassinate
a French finance minister only to be thwarted

193
00:17:50,163 --> 00:17:56,484
by Elongated Man, the first of several battles
against the hero across Europe. When the archdemon

194
00:17:56,544 --> 00:18:02,426
Niron offered numerous villains upgraded powers,
Copperhead sold his soul to be transformed

195
00:18:02,866 --> 00:18:08,688
into a human-snake hybrid. This new form enhanced
his physical abilities, granting him actual

196
00:18:08,748 --> 00:18:15,709
venomous fangs, superhuman strength, and predatory
instincts. However, it also eroded his humanity.

197
00:18:16,182 --> 00:18:22,585
making him more animalistic and driven by primal
urges. In his transformed state, Copperhead

198
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:27,948
became a vicious killer. He battled Superboy
in Hawaii, where his venomous bite managed

199
00:18:28,028 --> 00:18:33,251
to pierce the young hero's skin. Though he was
temporarily defeated, Copperhead survived and

200
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:38,254
joined the Suicide Squad, only to betray the
mission and escape with his newfound freedom.

201
00:18:38,854 --> 00:18:45,154
As his monstrous tendencies grew, Copperhead
devolved into a serial killer monster. consuming

202
00:18:45,194 --> 00:18:50,398
the victims he slaughtered. His killing spree
ended when District Attorney Kate Spencer,

203
00:18:50,579 --> 00:18:56,684
secretly the vigilante Manhunter, tracked him
down. In a brutal confrontation, Manhunter

204
00:18:56,744 --> 00:19:02,228
killed Copperhead with an energy baton, ending
his reign of terror. By the time of his death,

205
00:19:02,248 --> 00:19:07,953
Copperhead had claimed over 48 lives. Later,
Copperhead was resurrected as a member of the

206
00:19:07,993 --> 00:19:13,986
Black Lantern Corps during the Blackest Night.
As a Black Lantern Zombie, He attacked Coast

207
00:19:14,046 --> 00:19:19,712
City along other reanimated villains and attempted
to kill the Flash. However, he was ultimately

208
00:19:19,752 --> 00:19:25,717
destroyed when Green Lantern annihilated his
Black Lantern ring. In post-Flashpoint continuity,

209
00:19:25,777 --> 00:19:31,743
Copperhead underwent several incarnations. The
first was Samir Park, a snake-like metahuman

210
00:19:32,023 --> 00:19:37,568
who joined the Seeker Society of Super-Villains.
This version of Copperhead was nearly successful

211
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:42,311
in killing the hero Black Canary, as he was
immune to her sonic scream due to his lack

212
00:19:42,351 --> 00:19:48,095
of ears. She was rescued, however, by the Justice
League, and Copperhead continued working with

213
00:19:48,115 --> 00:19:53,139
the Seeker Society up until his death at the
hands of Deathstroke, who betrayed the Seeker

214
00:19:53,179 --> 00:19:58,522
Society to join Lex Luthor's and Justice League.
You can learn more about Black Canary, Deathstroke,

215
00:19:58,582 --> 00:20:04,366
and Lex Luthor in their respective duels against
Black Widow, Deadpool, and Baron Zemo. After

216
00:20:04,406 --> 00:20:09,414
Samir Park's death, the mantle of Copperhead
passed to a South American woman using the

217
00:20:09,494 --> 00:20:15,619
alias Jane Doe. This version of Copperhead was
a deadly hitwoman and crime boss renowned for

218
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:20,763
her lethal, venomous attacks, rivaling the toxic
villainess Cheshire, who you can learn more

219
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:26,568
about in her duel against Silver Samurai. Copperhead
established herself as a prominent figure in

220
00:20:26,628 --> 00:20:31,291
Central City's criminal underworld, taking over
her family's crime syndicate after serving

221
00:20:31,372 --> 00:20:37,056
as a mercenary. Her tenure as a crime boss brought
her into conflict with several heroes, including

222
00:20:37,116 --> 00:20:43,193
Batman and The Flash. When Two-Face placed a
bounty on Batman's head, Copperhead was among

223
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:48,518
the mercenaries who pursued him, tracking him
to a moving train. Though she attempted to

224
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:54,243
kill him, he evaded her by leaping into a nearby
river. Copperhead's activities eventually drew

225
00:20:54,263 --> 00:20:59,628
the attention of The Flash, who arrested her
mercenary enforcers including Shrapnel, Black

226
00:20:59,668 --> 00:21:05,653
Spider, and the Trigger Twins. This setback
forced Copperhead to negotiate with Captain

227
00:21:05,713 --> 00:21:10,775
Cold. the rival crime lord encroaching on her
territory, who you can learn more about in

228
00:21:10,815 --> 00:21:16,697
his duel against Pyro. Captain Cold betrayed
Copperhead, however, by planting a bomb in

229
00:21:16,717 --> 00:21:22,538
a weapon's delivery. The Flash intervened to
save Copperhead from the explosion and apprehended

230
00:21:22,578 --> 00:21:28,160
Captain Cold, though Copperhead herself avoided
prosecution due to insufficient evidence of

231
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:34,030
her involvement. This Copperhead was later jailed
in Iron Heights, prisoned by Superman, after

232
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:39,734
she attacked reporters at the Daily Planet.
An unnamed iteration of Copperhead, possibly

233
00:21:40,134 --> 00:21:46,058
a reimagining of the original, recently appeared
as a copper-skinned criminal. This Copperhead

234
00:21:46,118 --> 00:21:52,202
joined forces with Asp and Lady Viper to form
the Snake Gang, and were nearly successful

235
00:21:52,262 --> 00:21:57,106
in defeating the Birds of Prey before the villainous
group was defeated and disbanded.

236
00:22:02,606 --> 00:22:09,990
who traditionally wears a suit woven from experimental
elastic metal fibers coated in a polymer film.

237
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:16,154
This not only grants him enhanced durability,
flexibility, and the insurance that most physical

238
00:22:16,174 --> 00:22:21,837
blows will glance right off of him, but it also
allows him to travel with surprising speed

239
00:22:21,997 --> 00:22:27,821
due to his reduced friction and his knack for
slipping into tight spaces. The guy is basically

240
00:22:27,921 --> 00:22:33,015
untouchable. The suit also has suction cups
at the ends of the limbs, allowing him to adhere

241
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:38,936
and maneuver across most solid surfaces, and
his helmet is equipped with sharp, fang-like

242
00:22:38,996 --> 00:22:45,718
blades, coated with a toxin that causes paralysis
and eventual death after a half hour. He's

243
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:51,360
also an experienced martial artist, often using
his suit's heavy and stretchable tail to shatter

244
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:58,258
bones or even rock, or bind and crush his foes.
That's Copperhead. You know how I know that

245
00:22:58,298 --> 00:23:04,760
Marvel is better than DC? Uh, no I don't know.
Because when DC gets a supervillain group of

246
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:09,701
snake-themed villains together, they call them
the Snake Gang. Yet when Marvel does it, they

247
00:23:09,741 --> 00:23:16,083
call it the Serpent Society. That's a badass
name. That's how Marvel's better. Okay, I'm

248
00:23:16,123 --> 00:23:22,025
pretty sure the Serpent Society name was already
taken by the time the Snake Gang was formed,

249
00:23:22,465 --> 00:23:27,620
so you should go f yourself. Serpent Society?
Oh, that sounds a lot like the Secret Society

250
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:32,505
to me, of which Copperhead was already a part
of. You mean the Secret Society of Super-Villains?

251
00:23:32,985 --> 00:23:38,770
Well, yeah, that's the longer version of the
name. Okay. How long is Copperhead's tail?

252
00:23:39,611 --> 00:23:45,797
Uh, it could stretch. It could stretch to wrap
a man up at least twice. So, comparatively

253
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:51,650
to Scorpion's 10-foot long tail, Copperhead
has kind of like a chode going on. I didn't

254
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:57,363
realize this was a tail measuring contest, my
friend. Doesn't matter the size. It's how you

255
00:23:57,504 --> 00:24:01,733
use it. Well, let's find out how these guys
use their tails as we get into the match.

who will emerge victorious. Visit dynamicpodcast.com,
where we settle the debate and settle the score.

264
00:24:56,066 --> 00:24:59,186
Now that we got their histories and abilities
out of the way, we're going to speculate on

265
00:24:59,246 --> 00:25:04,708
how one of the 1000 simulated matches will go.
The winner is determined by simulations, not

266
00:25:04,748 --> 00:25:09,549
our speculation, but it's fun to imagine how
the fight could play out. AJ9K, what are the

267
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:14,671
rules of our speculation? Well, I should say
there are no rules, other than the characters

268
00:25:14,691 --> 00:25:19,232
have no prior knowledge of the other going into
the fight. All they are aware of starting out

269
00:25:19,572 --> 00:25:23,833
is that the other character is a threat that
needs to be eliminated. For the speculation...

270
00:25:24,182 --> 00:25:29,184
The contestants will begin approximately 50
meters apart in a nondescript environment that

271
00:25:29,204 --> 00:25:33,606
will have no bearing on the match itself, as
no environmental statistics are considered

272
00:25:33,626 --> 00:25:38,848
in my simulations. The contestants must earn
victory on their own merit. Alright then, let's

273
00:25:38,888 --> 00:25:44,850
get into it. Copperhead and Scorpion meet on
the battlefield. Who goes first? So I'm going

274
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:49,613
to say that Scorpion goes first. And like they
seem about the same in terms of speed anyway.

275
00:25:49,693 --> 00:25:56,679
So Scorpion... is gonna use his prehensile scorpion
tail to launch himself into the air with this

276
00:25:56,699 --> 00:26:02,921
like giant leap that covers the entire 50 meter
distance between them and as he lands near

277
00:26:03,041 --> 00:26:09,282
copperhead scorpion's gonna lunge with his tail
in a move that just impales copperhead on his

278
00:26:09,342 --> 00:26:14,564
tail bar. Well I mean of course copperhead is
gonna see scorpion leaping towards him it's

279
00:26:14,624 --> 00:26:21,746
very telegraphed so just before scorpion's tail
impales him copperhead's gonna You know, dart

280
00:26:21,766 --> 00:26:28,089
to the side, just enough for Scorpion's barb
to glance off of his suit's slick surface.

281
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:34,233
At which point, Copperhead's gonna, you know,
drop to the ground, slide underneath Scorpion

282
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:40,076
between his legs, and then slip up and over
his back and just wrap his tail around Scorpion's

283
00:26:40,156 --> 00:26:45,319
neck, crushing his throat like it was just nothing.
You dumbass! You don't want to attack Scorpion

284
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:50,551
from behind. That's the worst place to attack
Scorpion, okay? So... As Copperhead's choking

285
00:26:50,571 --> 00:26:54,954
Kim out from behind with his tail, Scorpion's
just gonna fire a green laser beam from his

286
00:26:54,994 --> 00:26:59,417
tail that's gonna tag Copperhead right in the
back of the head and essentially just blow

287
00:26:59,437 --> 00:27:04,261
his brains out. Dude, blow his brains out? What
are you talking about? Like not only is Copperhead

288
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:10,965
wearing a metallic helmet for protection, but
it's also coated in a gel that's heat resistant.

289
00:27:11,025 --> 00:27:19,234
So yeah, he's fine. Heat resistant gel on his
head? Yeah. Okay, alright, so the laser beam

290
00:27:19,275 --> 00:27:25,017
didn't work because fucking lube boy is all
lubed up over here. Ha ha ha! Scorpion's getting

291
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:30,339
choked out, he's about to pass out, so instead
he's gonna use his tail to wrap around Copperhead's

292
00:27:30,379 --> 00:27:35,321
body and just yank him off of him and slam him
into the ground. Okay, but I mean, the stronger

293
00:27:35,361 --> 00:27:40,003
Scorpion's tail wraps around Copperhead, you
know, the faster Copperhead's just gonna get

294
00:27:40,163 --> 00:27:46,834
squeezed out of that tail's grasp, because again,
he's super slippery. Ha ha ha! So... Copperhead

295
00:27:46,914 --> 00:27:52,158
slips away from Scorpion and he slides across
the ground in this zigzagging, like confusing

296
00:27:52,278 --> 00:27:57,081
motion. So Scorpion doesn't know if he's coming
at him or if he's moving away from him until

297
00:27:57,101 --> 00:28:03,265
it's too late. Copperhead's gonna lunge at Scorpion
and sink his helmet's fangs into Scorpion's

298
00:28:03,385 --> 00:28:08,149
neck, poisoning him. Scorpion has Scorpion Sense
with his new suit that Smythe gave him. So

299
00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:13,552
his Scorpion Sense activates, it alerts him
to Copperhead's attack, and as his big ass

300
00:28:13,612 --> 00:28:19,197
mouth is about to chomp down on him. Scorpion
grabs Copperhead by the jaw with his pincer

301
00:28:19,237 --> 00:28:24,401
gloves on his suit and he's gonna use their
superior grip to just straight up rip Copperhead's

302
00:28:24,461 --> 00:28:31,167
jaw off with his hands. Big ass helmet you mean.
What? Big ass helmet. It's not his actual mouth.

303
00:28:31,467 --> 00:28:38,072
You said Scorpion is larger, but Copperhead
has a bigger helmet. Yeah, I was talking about

304
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:42,296
his mouth helmet. I hate that phrase. What are
we saying? I never want to say mouth helmet

305
00:28:42,336 --> 00:28:49,109
again for the rest of my life. But yeah, Scorpion
uses his pincer gloves to rip off Copperhead's

306
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:55,315
helmet. Or at least he tries to, but his pincer
just slipped right off. Copperhead's helmet

307
00:28:55,395 --> 00:29:04,222
is just too slippery. Well, if Scorpion's pincers
slip off of Copperhead's helmet, then they're

308
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:10,207
just going to slip right onto Copperhead's exposed
face. And then Scorpion just rips the guy's

309
00:29:10,247 --> 00:29:16,002
face right off. There's nothing he can do with
his face anymore. Oh damn. Maybe he should

310
00:29:16,042 --> 00:29:21,225
lube up his face too next time. Well, I mean,
actually, with Scorpion's hands so close to

311
00:29:21,265 --> 00:29:28,129
Copperhead's fangs, that was just the opportunity
that Copperhead needed to twist his head and

312
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:34,213
pierce Scorpion's hands, paralyzing them and
causing Scorpion to drop Copperhead, at which

313
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:40,996
point all Copperhead has to do is evade Scorpion's
attacks as the paralysis spreads and Scorpion

314
00:29:41,016 --> 00:29:46,038
soon dies from the venom. You said it takes
like half an hour for Copperhead's venom to

315
00:29:46,058 --> 00:29:52,140
kill somebody? Yeah, but in the meantime they
slowly lose the ability to move. A half an

316
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,421
hour is a long ass time. Like eventually you
would think that Scorpion would get a shot

317
00:29:56,461 --> 00:30:01,863
in. The more time that passes the less likely
that would be the case. But I think you're

318
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:07,484
forgetting an important detail in that Scorpion
has armored gloves. So no, Copperhead does

319
00:30:07,604 --> 00:30:14,435
not bite through his hands and I say Scorpion...
does rip off Copperhead's face with his pincers,

320
00:30:15,015 --> 00:30:21,398
and then he shoots acid down the face hole for
his Mortal Kombat fatality. Oh, what scorpion

321
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:31,222
is this? You know, scorpion. Okay. I say you're
dreaming, because scorpion's hands may be armored,

322
00:30:31,642 --> 00:30:35,584
but Copperhead's fangs are sharp, and they'll
manage to puncture a spot on the wrist where

323
00:30:35,604 --> 00:30:40,086
it's unarmored, like at an exposed joint or
something. Well, let's find out. We'll go ahead

324
00:30:40,106 --> 00:30:45,090
and leave the match there. We'll input these
characters' stats, run the simulations, and

325
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:49,953
find out which scenario happens when we come
back with a winner. Yeah, either Copperhead

326
00:30:50,253 --> 00:30:56,818
managed to pierce Scorpion with his poisonous
fangs, slowly paralyzing and killing him, or

327
00:30:57,078 --> 00:31:04,563
Scorpion straight up rips off Copperhead's face
and burns his body inside the suit with acid.

328
00:31:05,023 --> 00:31:14,177
AG9K, run the stats. Running calculations, processing
results, simulations complete. Copperhead is

329
00:31:14,197 --> 00:31:19,300
a pretty cool character. I think he was a pretty
solid match up for Scorpion. The characters

330
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,564
had a lot of stats that evened out, including
movement speed, durability, intelligence, and

331
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:30,387
they came pretty close in other stats like perception
and versatility. Yeah, I think the two biggest

332
00:31:30,427 --> 00:31:35,786
discrepancies between their stats were strength
and evasiveness. Copperhead. is really damn

333
00:31:35,806 --> 00:31:42,191
evasive. I had no idea that he was such a slippery
character until our speculation. But Scorpion

334
00:31:42,392 --> 00:31:47,936
is stronger than Copperhead. We did say that
Copperhead was a better fighter, but Scorpion

335
00:31:48,296 --> 00:31:52,940
is more versatile considering he can do everything
Copperhead can do, but he also has, you know,

336
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:58,404
the laser beams and the acid. So with all that
in consideration, Jonathan, who do you think

337
00:31:58,685 --> 00:32:03,048
is coming out on top in this match? I think
both characters are pretty impressive. I'm

338
00:32:03,108 --> 00:32:10,316
hoping Copperhead comes out Not 100% sure. Instagram
definitely disagrees with me in our poll so

339
00:32:10,396 --> 00:32:17,839
far. It looks like 67% of people believe that
Scorpion will win this match. So about two

340
00:32:17,879 --> 00:32:24,342
thirds. Well, let's see if the stats agree with
them. AJ9K, the results please. Hey, Yuasa.

341
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:35,426
All right, the winner between Copperhead and
Scorpion is Scorpion. I figured, here I am!

342
00:32:35,947 --> 00:32:42,229
Rock you like a hurricane! You know, that song
that's sung by the scorpions, Rock you like

343
00:32:42,249 --> 00:32:48,052
a hurricane. Anyway, Scorpion wins. Is there
a band called Copperhead? Probably, but they

344
00:32:48,332 --> 00:32:54,715
probably suck. Anyway, this wasn't that close
of a match. Scorpion beat Copperhead 627 times

345
00:32:55,095 --> 00:33:01,670
out of the 1000 battles, whereas Copperhead
only won 373 matches. So it was Scorpion's

346
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:10,872
62.7% win rate over Copperhead's 37.3% win rate.
Well, that's dumb. In the end, Scorpion was

347
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:16,994
just too strong. He had a slight range advantage
considering that Copperhead doesn't really

348
00:33:17,014 --> 00:33:23,316
have much range at all except for his shorter
tail and versatility. I think in the end, we

349
00:33:23,356 --> 00:33:28,217
learn here that size actually does matter. Yeah,
the size of the helmet, right? And being lubed

350
00:33:28,377 --> 00:33:34,272
helps. Clearly not enough in Copperhead's case.
But that does it for this duel guys. Congrats

351
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:41,442
to Marvel fans for the win this go round. AJ9K

In our next episode, as we mentioned earlier,
we will be doing a review of the direct to

358
00:34:15,901 --> 00:34:22,985
video animated DC film Watchmen Chapter 2, the
conclusion in a two-part animated Watchmen

359
00:34:23,065 --> 00:34:28,368
adaptation. Yeah, we found the first part to
be redundant, but at least the second half

360
00:34:28,388 --> 00:34:33,071
of the Watchmen story has a lot more exciting
things happen. So we'll see if it's any better.

361
00:34:33,511 --> 00:34:37,353
