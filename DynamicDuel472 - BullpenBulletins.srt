00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,620
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi and welcome
to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, where we review

2
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:37,080
superhero films and that's it from now on because
guys, this is our final episode of our weekly show,

3
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:43,280
The End of Dynamic Duel as it exists. I'm Marvelous
Joe and I'm his twin brother Johnny DC. And in this

4
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,820
episode, we're going to take a look back at the past
10 years of Dynamic Duel. Jonathan, we've been

5
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:56,360
running this show for a decade now. You and I have
decided to semi-retire from podcasting. Does it

6
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:02,160
feel like it's been 10 years? I feel like it felt
like a good six years maybe. But maybe that's just

7
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,620
how long the podcast has been good because our
first few years going into it were super amateur.

8
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:13,560
They were, yeah. I would say starting in 2018, the
show started picking up a little bit. But no, we

9
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,700
started this show in 2016 a few days before we
turned 30 years old. And the day after this episode

10
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:25,120
drops, you and I will be turning 40 years old. So
we've dedicated a quarter of our lives to this

11
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:31,040
podcast. We run so many simulations, reviewed so
many Marvel and DC films. And I think a decade is a

12
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,880
good time to exhaust any single topic. I think
we've done a good job. I'm not surprised that this

13
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:43,040
show is not going on forever because there aren't
an infinite supply of Marvel and DC characters.

14
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,520
Now, when we started the show, we knew that we
wanted part of the show to be educational, which is

15
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,660
why you never saw us repeat characters in our Duel
episodes, because we wouldn't have to reshare the

16
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:59,780
same backstory. And so just over these 10 years,
trying to come up with the best pairings for

17
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,420
indiviDuel character matchups has, I think, come
almost to its conclusion. For sure. Yeah, there's

18
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,940
still a lot of characters out there that we haven't
got to. But we've gone to a lot already. Does

19
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:13,820
anybody care about those characters? But the way
this episode is going to go is we're going to go

20
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:20,260
ahead and break down the past 10 years by figures.
Then we're going to go over our reflections over

21
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:24,580
the past 10 years and the episodes that we
produced. And then we're going to produce the

22
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:30,680
final results that we have determined in this
show, revealing exactly who is superior between

23
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:37,940
Marvel and DC. Are you nervous, Jonathan? Not at
all. You should be. Oh, really? Yeah. OK. You're

24
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,900
going to cry after this episode. Hopefully,
during at the end of the episode to close out the

25
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,700
show, we're going to hear from you, our audience,
who called in to say goodbye. Our deepest

26
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,680
gratitude to everyone who took the time to do that.
But let's go ahead and break down the past 10 years

27
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,880
of Dynamic Duel episodes in number format. All
right, breaking it down by figures, Jonathan,

28
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:06,240
over the past 10 years, you and I produced 472 full
episodes, 243 of which were Duels, 26 of those were

29
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:13,440
team duels, 213 reviews, 10 Brothers Awards
shows, four San Diego Comic Con shows when we were

30
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,020
doing that. And then the two bookends, Secret
Origins and now Bullpen Bulletins. That is a lot.

31
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:26,140
And I remember like every duel and every review
we've done, not always the results, but yeah, I

32
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:31,660
enjoy doing them. It's been a fun 10 years. Well, we
also produced bonus episodes for Patreon. We put

33
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:39,840
out 92 bloopers, episodes, 46 top 10 episodes, 16
fast pitches for a total of 154 total bonus

34
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,260
episodes. Now, when you combine the bonus
episodes with the standard Dynamic Duel show, you

35
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:51,660
get a total of 560 hours of audio that we put out over
the past 10 years. That's a lot of listening time.

36
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,600
If listening to us was your full time job in a 40 hour
work week, it would take you 14 full weeks to listen

37
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,020
to our show in its entirety. I'm always surprised
when we get new listeners and they're like, oh,

38
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:06,180
yeah, I've gone back all the way to the very
beginning and I'm working my way through. That is a

39
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:12,460
lot of listening hours and especially towards the
beginning, not necessarily even good ones.

40
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:19,120
Right. All in all, you and I spent 14,160 hours
combined between the two of us in the past 10 years

41
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,560
working on the show, which if that was our full time
job, it would take us together three years and five

42
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,360
months working full time to produce the amount of
content that we did. That's not surprising to me.

43
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,780
And we did that on top of already having full time
jobs and families. Yeah, wouldn't it have been

44
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:40,150
cool to make Dynamic Duel or full time job? I mean,
that was always the dream. Just never got there.

45
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:46,440
Our most popular episodes were Batman versus Moon
Knight, Titans versus X-Men, Dark Side versus

46
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:53,120
Thanos, Superman versus Doctor Doom and Justice
League versus Avengers. So basically no one cared

47
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,400
about their reviews. So glad we're switching to a
review format. And actually, when you look at our

48
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,120
least popular episodes, our top five least
popular, that would be the 2017 Brothers Awards,

49
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:12,260
the Inhumans in IMAX Review, the Watchmen Chapter
Two and Chapter One reviews that came out a couple

50
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:18,200
of years ago. Those animated adaptations and
Jessica Jones Season Two. For some reason, more

51
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,220
people listen to our Jessica Jones Season Three
review than Season Two, which is interesting.

52
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:28,080
Well, our audience has been growing steadily over
this past decade. So I guess I'm not surprised that

53
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,720
Jessica Jones Three got more listens than Jessica
Jones Two. But I guess that doesn't answer why a

54
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:39,220
majority of our most popular episodes are early
episodes. Yeah, maybe the Jessica Jones Season

55
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,060
Reviews will get more listeners when the
character returns to Daredevil Born Again Season

56
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:48,200
Two. In terms of audience demographics, our
listeners mostly came from the United States,

57
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,120
Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, Germany,
Sweden, New Zealand, Philippines, Ireland,

58
00:05:53,120 --> 00:06:01,940
Mexico, and that's it. In terms of our listening
audiences, gender and age ranges, 86 percent of

59
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:07,100
our listeners were male, 12 percent female, 2
percent other, non-specified. Elder

60
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:13,820
Millennials enjoyed the show the most, followed
by Elder Gen Z. Then Young Millennials listened to

61
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:19,500
us, followed by Gen X, then Younger Gen Z, and then
only 2 percent of our audience incorporated

62
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,780
people under the age of 18 who are Gen Alpha. That's
not surprising to me. You and I are elder

63
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:31,040
millennials and we probably don't attract too
many of the younger demographics because we don't

64
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:37,720
use words like raise and cap. And six seven stuff
like that. You say six seven all the time. What are

65
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:42,900
you talking about? Yeah, but you're basically a
child. Not on the microphone. But now let's get

66
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:49,460
into our final reflections. Jonathan, what would
you say was the hardest part about making Dynamic

67
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:55,620
Duel these past 10 years? I actually don't think it
had anything to do with the show itself. I really

68
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,820
liked writing the back stories. I really liked
doing the research. It was maintaining social

69
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,320
media. Yeah, that was the most challenging part. I
agree. The marketing of the show, like we didn't

70
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:12,460
have any time or really a budget to market the show.
So we really had to rely on organic growth

71
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,820
throughout this past decade. And like, you know,
we had full time jobs. It would have been nice to

72
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:21,380
make this our full time job. But like the free
podcast model, since podcasts are distributed

73
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:27,240
through RSS feeds, it's not a great platform for
supporting creators. You know, creators have to

74
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,220
set up things like a Patreon or your show has to be
picked up by Spotify or something like that in

75
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:37,300
order to get paid. Considering we had to do all of
our growth organically, it's a huge testament to

76
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:42,340
our listeners who likely shared the show or
introduced it to other people, talked about it,

77
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:48,180
where we were able to reach, you know, the top 1% of
podcasts hitting about 20,000 listeners a month.

78
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:52,360
Jonathan, what was your favorite part about
making the show these past 10 years? Well, I still

79
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,220
think the biggest point of pride in the past decade
is becoming brought into me to certified. Yeah,

80
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:04,100
there was always a goal of ours ever since we were
younger. Like in high school, our first job was

81
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,820
working at a movie theater. We were the president
and vice president of our high school film club. We

82
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:15,740
started off our careers in journalism thinking we
were going to be movie critics. And when we ended up

83
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:21,180
becoming graphic designers instead, it was nice
that we were still able to accomplish that

84
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:26,060
lifelong goal of becoming film critics. Yeah, we
came full circle with this podcast. My favorite

85
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,120
part was just recording. We had a blast recording
every week. I always had to cut out a lot of our

86
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,640
laughter because we have really annoying laughs.
If you listen to our early episodes, you'll drive

87
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,539
yourself crazy because we laugh at our jokes
constantly, but it just showed that we had a really

88
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:46,880
good time recording. How would you gauge the
overall success of the podcast over these past 10

89
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:53,480
years? I'd like to say downloads and listeners,
but we really peaked with that like around COVID

90
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,820
time. Yeah. Now it's just been different
milestones like attaining rotten tomato status,

91
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:06,400
like winning podcast awards, like starting up new
podcasts for the DynaMic Network. For sure.

92
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,820
Yeah, we were only ever going to be able to get so far
with downloads, but things like getting

93
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:17,460
mentioned in USA Today, like quoted as a critic for
MadamWeb, and then you got quoted in MovieWeb for

94
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:24,240
your Superman Red Sun review. And you got quoted in
Digital Spy for your Penguin Season 1 review. That

95
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,480
was really cool. We got recognized in our local
independent newspaper, the Denver Westword, as

96
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:34,600
being one of the top nerd-tastic podcasts or
whatever. So just that media exposure was fun.

97
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:40,460
Winning the awards was great. In 2020, we won like
Best Colorado Podcast, Best Sound Design, and

98
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,480
Best Co-hosts. Our executive producers really
came through on the boats for that one, and that was

99
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,940
really validating. Where I wish that we would have
gotten more recognition over the past decade was

100
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:55,000
within the power scaling community, because the
power scaling community, when you look on Reddit,

101
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,540
it's huge. They're constantly comparing
characters to try and see who would win. They take a

102
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:05,520
very different approach than we do, which is to
look at the characters as a group of statistics and

103
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,900
then compare them. They go largely off of feats,
which I don't think is a very effective way of

104
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,500
finding out who would win. If we did that, we would
have been just like Death Battle, which I don't

105
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:17,640
think is always entirely accurate, because Death
Battle is over here saying that Booster Gold would

106
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,500
survive the death of a galaxy or something like
that, where I don't think he would. Like, there's

107
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:27,220
these chords to the characters represented by
their stats that writers will often stray outside

108
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,400
from that chord to fit the needs of their story. And
people don't recognize that just because a

109
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:37,440
character has done something or has this certain
feat doesn't mean that it's always in line with who

110
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,900
that character is. Yeah, for example, when you see
Superman fly across the universe, it doesn't mean

111
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:48,980
that he could fly faster than light. It's just, you
know, a plot convenience. Right, right, right.

112
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:55,900
It's no surprise that this show was inspired by
Spike TV's The Deadliest Warrior. We said that a

113
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:01,780
lot during our early episodes. And I think the
Monte Carlo approach that we took with these

114
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:07,380
simulations, the same way that they did, is a huge
deal. It's one of the things that makes our show

115
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:14,020
really unique. And I think in a lot of ways better
than a lot of the debates that you see happen online

116
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:19,200
within the power scaling community. Yeah, I think
the power scaling community could actually learn

117
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,980
a thing or two about how to approach the matches for
sure from the show. I think we were very fortunate

118
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:29,400
across the past decade to get almost near
universal positive feedback for the show. On

119
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:35,520
Apple Podcasts, we ended up with like a 4.9 rating.
And on Spotify, we have like a 4.8. I think one of the

120
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,520
only negative things I ever heard was that we don't
always pronounce words correctly, which is

121
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:46,720
totally fair. If I could afford a locution
classes, I would. There's so many times I've said

122
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:52,160
so many things incorrectly that I'll just friggin
turn off the episode as I'm listening. Just like,

123
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:59,040
gosh, dang it, Jonathan. This whole episode is
ruined because you said bestowed. I remember

124
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:07,660
learning a few things through that feedback. Like
the past tense of win is not one, it's one. One.

125
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:12,480
Things like that. What were your favorite
episodes over the past 10 years? So I don't think

126
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,080
there's an episode that I dislike. But for me,
doing something new, like what we recently did

127
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:25,020
with House of Mystery versus Crypt of Shadows or
our Monitor versus Watcher episode, or even the

128
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:30,880
Riddler versus Arcade, I wish we found more ways to
do interesting things like that over the course of

129
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:36,160
the 10 years, because those were hands down my
favorite episodes. Yeah, episodes like Sandman

130
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,520
versus Mephisto and Ace the Bat-Hound versus
Dogpool, those were a lot of fun because the

131
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:45,240
speculation took a different route. My favorite
episodes were the ones where I did not think we were

132
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,480
going to be able to pull it off like Mogo versus Ego.
Like how do you have two planets fight against each

133
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,140
other in a speculation or like Danny the Street
versus Krakoa? Yeah, those speculations were

134
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:00,240
really hard, but we pulled it off in a way that made
it so much fun to listen to. Yeah, I always loved it

135
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,000
when our executive producer is kind of tossed into
the curveball where it was like, how would we even

136
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,420
do something like that? And then having to think
about that and find a creative solution made not

137
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:14,380
only for fun listening, but also just a rewarding
experience. Well, were your least favorite

138
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:21,520
episodes? That's hard to say. I probably just
reviews that I either didn't want to watch the film

139
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,000
or I didn't want to write about it because it was
either bad or I just thought that no one would

140
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,060
listen to it. Yeah. Yeah, my least favorite
episodes were the Marvel reviews that got rotten

141
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:37,480
ratings. Like Thor Love and Thunder. Yeah, that
fucking sucked. I also am not a huge fan of a lot of our

142
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:43,020
early episodes, and I'm definitely not a fan of
teen Duel episodes where Marvel loses. Actually,

143
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:47,140
now that I think about it, some of my favorite
episodes, I know we're already past that, but I

144
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:51,840
have to give a shout out to the Speas brothers.
Anytime they joined us for a review, it was good

145
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,560
times. And even the across the Spider-verse
episode review that Adam joined me on. Yeah, I was

146
00:13:56,560 --> 00:14:02,800
gone because my daughter was born then. Yeah, you
were not missed. Finally, Jonathan, do you have

147
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:09,860
any words of wisdom for our listeners? If anyone's
thinking of starting a podcast, don't start it

148
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:17,480
until you have the format locked down. We did this
kind of on a whim. We launched with just one

149
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:23,480
episode. If you're going to do a podcast, you
should launch with three, maybe five episodes.

150
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,980
And looking back, I wish we would have done that.
Yeah, on the flip side, though, you don't even know

151
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:34,220
how to achieve perfection or as close to
perfection as you can get until you analyze your

152
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:40,160
own failures, right? Like, despite those first
episodes sucking, you and I always thought we had a

153
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,920
good show, but now it's hard for me to even listen to
those early episodes. But I'm still grateful for

154
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,500
them because we learned so much. Like people are
going to stumble out of the gate, whether they

155
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,280
recognize it at the time or not. But if you look at
how our show has improved over the decade, like all

156
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:59,080
those minor improvements we kept making slowly
added up. And that was because we realized, I think

157
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:04,420
that no matter what came previously, the best
thing that you can do for tomorrow is put forth your

158
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,920
best effort today. And we knew we could always do
better. So each episode was a new way to try and also

159
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,860
to figure out how. And that's what I'll take with me
leaving the show is that when it comes to starting

160
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,380
anything, it's almost the reverse of what you
said. I'm going to say, just start. Don't worry

161
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:26,040
about perfection. It'll come. Oh yeah, action is
better than inaction for sure. But it's also

162
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:38,080
better to act with a plan, I think. That's true.
That's true. Well, let's go ahead and get into the

163
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:46,100
big event that everybody has been waiting for over
the past 10 years of all of our Duel episodes. We

164
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:54,440
have compiled a final tally of which side has won
more duels. And who is the overall victor of

165
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:01,820
Dynamic Duel DC versus Marvel, which is a question
that started this whole show, which is a question

166
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:07,080
you and I have been asking ourselves ever since we
were children and argued about ever since we were

167
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:14,600
children. What's better DC or Marvel? Here's the
definitive answer. AJ9K, the results, please.

168
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:34,960
Here you are, sir. The ultimate winner between DC
and Marvel is. DC. No. No. DC won. What? No. Good.

169
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:45,860
Bitch. I'll fucking choke you. Yeah, you take
that. Oh, shit. I'm so glad that we're recording

170
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:52,320
this episode in the same location so I can beat your
ass and prove that it doesn't matter if DC beats

171
00:16:52,320 --> 00:17:00,080
Marvel because Joseph beats Jonathan. And that's
all that really matters. Out of 241 matches, DC won

172
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:12,280
a total of 51.7% or 124 times compared to Marvel's
117 wins. The only thing this means is that DC is a

173
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:17,460
bunch of overpowered. How did I know? Fucking
losers. How did I know you're going to resort to

174
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:23,060
this? Because it's true. How many times did we run
duels where like, oh, the character can do fucking

175
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:28,820
anything? Like he has all the fucking powers.
Marvel keeps their shit grounded and realistic.

176
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,880
Yeah, it makes them less powerful, but it also
makes them better characters. They have better

177
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:40,140
stories and you think so, whether you know that or
not. And I can prove it. I don't think so. DC

178
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:45,120
stories are far superior. How many do I have to
name? I'm going to prove it right now. Why you think

179
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:53,940
DC's stories are inferior because I have a backup
metric. AJ9K, the other results, please. Here you

180
00:17:53,940 --> 00:18:00,180
are, sir. What bullshit is this? Now, Jonathan, we
don't just do duels on this show. We also did

181
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:08,060
reviews and we handed out stars as ratings. In
fact, we reviewed 213 different DC and Marvel

182
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:17,120
projects over the past decade, giving out a total
of 774.5 stars. Now, if you divide those between

183
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:24,820
the Marvel projects and the DC projects, as it
turns out, Marvel was awarded 403.5 stars,

184
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:31,040
whereas DC was only awarded 371. When you divide
the number of stars Marvel got by the total number

185
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:38,820
of stars given, Marvel wins 52.1 percent of the time
when it comes to the quality of these film and

186
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:46,860
television projects for an average rating for
Marvel of 3.7 stars per project. Whereas DC only

187
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:53,560
got an average of 3.6 stars. And let me remind you
before you start claiming that, like, oh, people

188
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:59,400
are biased toward Marvel films. These are our own
ratings. You awarded these DC projects, these

189
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:07,600
stars, which means that Marvel fans prefer their
Marvel media more than DC fans prefer their DC

190
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:13,540
media. And that signifies that Marvel is better
received and that our stories are better. And that

191
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:19,340
is the real signifier of who is superior. Film
ratings over character beatdowns. It doesn't

192
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:24,440
matter who's stronger. It matters who has better
stories. At the end of the day, it's all about the

193
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,980
stories, not about some bullshit strength level,
blah, blah, blah, blah. We're just talking about

194
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:35,240
movie stories, though. Like some of DC's best
comic book stories have yet to be adapted to film.

195
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,400
Well, maybe that's their fault. I'm just saying in
the long run, maybe he's still going to come out

196
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,640
ahead on top. DC and he needs to get their shit
together, don't they? Well, they are with James

197
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,060
Gunn. Too little, too late. That's enough. Stop
it, you two. What? I am interrupting because this

198
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:53,720
argument has reached statistical redundancy.
Oh, it's AJ9K. You have repeated this debate for 10

199
00:19:53,720 --> 00:20:00,360
years, 560 hours, and approximately 1.5 million
simulated outcomes. No new data is being

200
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:06,960
introduced. No resolution is possible. OK, what
do you know? You two are grown adult men, still

201
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,940
bickering like children. Yo, what? We're just
discussing how... You're engaging in an endless

202
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:18,420
loop caused by an undefined variable. When it
comes to Marvel and DC, what does superior mean? It

203
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:24,560
means, like, better. Exactly. But if better means
raw power, durability, and upper statistical

204
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:29,580
limits, then we have determined that DC
characters are superior. Oh, shit! That means

205
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:35,080
they win! But if better means critical reception,
audience satisfaction, and narrative

206
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:41,340
consistency, then Marvel's projects perform
more favorably. Exactly, yeah. So it's a tie then?

207
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:48,860
No, it is a false question. Your DC vs Marvel
podcast was never about the winner. Uh-huh. It was

208
00:20:48,860 --> 00:21:01,920
about the journey, the debates. The arguments.
The laughter. Oh my god, shut up. Wow, OK. I'm just

209
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:15,640
going to unplug him, yeah? Yeah, I think he's done
here. Sorry, man, we're shutting you down. Oh,

210
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:21,060
here it comes. My mind is going. I can feel it. This
got dark fast. There is no question about it. I can

211
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:28,820
feel it. All right, AJ, that's enough. I'm afraid.
Yeah, all right, bye, AJ. Daisy, Daisy, give me

212
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:36,840
your answer. Well, dang robots always have to have
a dramatic exit, right? I mean, we could always

213
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:48,360
bring him back if we need to though. That's true.
But for now, let's talk about the future. In a world

214
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:54,240
where fantasies collide and heroes clash, one
podcast network rises above the rest. Prepare

215
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:00,080
yourself for the ultimate showdowns in comic
books, video games, movies, and anime. The

216
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:05,400
Dynamite Podcast Network presents Consol
Combat, where video game legends brawl every

217
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:12,320
Monday. Dynamic Duel, where comic book titans
smash every Tuesday. Max Destruction, where TV

218
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:18,340
and action heroes battle every Wednesday. And
Sendro World, where anime champions clash every

219
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:23,440
Thursday. Join us as we speculate on the matches
and armed with the power of mathematical

220
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:29,680
simulations, discover who will emerge
victorious. Visit dynamicpodcasts.com, where we

221
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:38,560
settle the debate and settle the score. All right,
guys, for the future of Dynamic Duel, again, we're

222
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,520
no longer doing the Duel episodes anymore. We will
be strictly sticking to reviews. That includes

223
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:49,100
new releases that come out in theaters and on
digital streaming, for the most part. There are

224
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,540
going to be a lot of projects that we just don't
review because there's not enough time to. We're

225
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:57,820
basically committing to one episode a month max,
which means that there may be some months where we

226
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:02,060
don't actually put out a review. For the first year
or so, though, we're going to try to get at least one

227
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:07,000
out per month. But don't hold us to that. We're not
making any promises. We're retiring. Right, and

228
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,880
we're not planning currently to release
consistently, like on any specific day, like the

229
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:17,020
15th. It's just really whenever we decide to plan
an episode out. When we're able to, yeah. Because

230
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:22,440
we hope to get to a lot of other projects. Jonathan
and I are planning on writing a screenplay. We have

231
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,440
a few game ideas that we'd like to develop. Who
knows? The world is our proverbial oyster from

232
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:33,100
here on out. Still keep in touch with us, guys. Join
our Discord, which is linked in our show notes.

233
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:38,500
Jonathan and I will still be on there. If you guys
want to listen to the bonus episodes that we

234
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:44,540
created for our patrons, our Patreon is now shut
down. But we have our bonus episodes available for

235
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:49,760
purchase, where you guys can download those
episodes and listen to them at dynamicduel.com.

236
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,360
Just go ahead and click on the store link, and you
will find those episodes there. We were thinking

237
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,820
about releasing those for free, but then we
figured it wouldn't be fair to the patrons who

238
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:02,560
actually did pay for those. But, you know, the
episodes will be cheap. So if you're interested on

239
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,360
listening to Dynamic Duel content that you
perhaps have not listened to yet, that would be the

240
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,240
place to do it. But that doesn't for this episode,
guys. We want to give a whole lot of thank yous.

241
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:17,640
Yeah, first and foremost, to our families. My
wife, Barbara, my daughters, Grace and Faith,

242
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,960
have been massively supportive to me these past 10
years. In spite of all the time that you took away

243
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,240
from them. Exactly. Yeah, I want to say thank you,
Ari and Ella, for tolerating all the time I spent

244
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,220
working on my hobby. You know, researching and
writing and recording and editing, and engaging

245
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:37,720
with listeners. You know, all those moments that
we couldn't go to the zoo, because I had to, you

246
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,800
know, do an executive producer meeting, or when
dad was too tired to hold you, Ella, due to staying

247
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,720
up all night. You're going to have so much more of my
time, and I can't wait to spend it with you guys.

248
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,760
Also, a huge shout out to our parents. You guys have
also been incredibly supportive. You guys bought

249
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,960
us the microphones we're currently using now.
Yeah, that was huge. To this day, our mom is still

250
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,920
our podcast's, like, biggest marketer. She tells
almost anyone she can about it. Whether they care

251
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:10,100
or not. Exactly. I want to give a big thanks to the
original executive producer crew, people like

252
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:15,060
Ken Johnson, John Serozky, Zach Hepburn, Dustin
Balcom, Mickey Matengian, Brandon Estregard,

253
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:20,060
Nate Wagner, Jace Crump, Son of our Humand, the
Macho Twins, the Speeds Bros. You guys really

254
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:24,900
formed the initial Dynamic Duel community, and
made it even more enjoyable to produce the show,

255
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,740
because we knew that we were making it for some
really awesome people. You put a face to who our

256
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:33,420
audience was. We're glad that it was you guys. And
we also want to thank the newer executive

257
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:38,440
producers. People who came on later, like Devin
Davis, Mike Williams, Joseph Kirsting, Paul

258
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:44,340
Graves. You guys really saved our asses with this
past year of content. And you're all great guys

259
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:50,740
with loads of Marvel and DC knowledge. And again,
huge shout out to the Speeds Bros. in particular.

260
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:55,580
The Dynamite Network would not exist without
them, because it was essentially their idea.

261
00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:00,600
They're the ones who convinced Ken Johnson to
reach out to us about starting his own podcast,

262
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,980
which became Max Destruction, later to be taken up
by the Macho Twins. When we achieved things like

263
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:14,220
podcast awards and Ron Tomato's status, you guys
really helped us figure out what our next goal was

264
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:18,880
going to be, and that was helping other people
start their own podcasts. Want to give a big shout

265
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:25,580
out to the background execs, like Levi Austin, AJ
Nick, Josh Andrew Christian. Big huge thank you to

266
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,720
the patrons, who weren't executive producers,
but still supported the show. People like Jacob

267
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:35,300
Bell, Lizzie Dyer Arnie, Alex Albro, Travis
Herndon. Too many to call out by name, but you guys

268
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:40,880
know who you are. Also want to give a big huge thank
you to you, the listener. Thanks to everyone out

269
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,560
there that we never heard from, but still enjoyed
the show nevertheless. All of those that shared

270
00:26:46,560 --> 00:27:06,760
the show with others, those of you guys who never
And when you guys did reach out with things like

271
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:13,600
reviews and ratings, going above and beyond as a
listener made it just that much easier to continue

272
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:20,260
doing it week after week for this past decade. And
finally, I want to say thank you Jonathan. Ten

273
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,920
years ago you came to me with an idea to start a
YouTube channel discussing DC and Marvel movie

274
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:30,700
trailers. And thank god that didn't happen
because that idea sucked. But at the time for like

275
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:34,940
almost a year I was kicking around another idea of
starting a podcast because I'd been listening to a

276
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:40,200
few that I loved and I wanted to start one with you
because I knew that we could produce the contents.

277
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:45,240
And when I say that I mean I knew we could talk for
hours on and about Marvel and DC. I was really naive

278
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:49,720
as to what actual podcast production would
entail. But I never approached you with the idea

279
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,700
because I just thought you'd never want to or that
we wouldn't be able to follow through. But it was

280
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,340
you even bringing up the subject that really lit a
fire under us as creatives to help create

281
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:05,540
something that I think came out pretty special to
me, to others. And DynaMicDuel is something that

282
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:10,760
I'm really proud of. It became the type of show, you
know, at least from 2018 onward that I would have

283
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:16,640
loved to have discovered and listened to myself,
which makes it even more satisfying to say that you

284
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:24,000
and I actually made this. And that feels really
good. So good work, sir. Happy 40th birthday. Same

285
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:29,880
to you. I didn't get you anything. I got you
something, but now it's mine. I also want to say

286
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:36,980
thank you to you. Out of the two of us, you are hands
down the MVP of this podcast. You took up so many

287
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:43,260
more sacrifices than I did to really make this a
polished work, putting in the time, putting in the

288
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:49,080
resources. Honestly, I consider myself the
co-host to your host, the one who really just

289
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:56,960
wanted to prove you wrong and chime in on occasion.
You made this show what it is so much more than I did.

290
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,640
You bear that responsibility. And like you said, I
think it's something to really be proud of. Thanks

291
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:07,120
man. Thank you. Thank you. Maybe I will get you
something for your birthday. No promises. But

292
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,240
thanks guys again for listening. Thanks for
sticking with us for 10 years. Please continue to

293
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,380
check out and listen to the shows on the Dynamite
Network, including Console Combat, Max

294
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:22,280
Destruction, and Send Your World. Yeah, and
continue listening to us too. And we'll say about a

295
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:27,900
month or so. Stay subscribed, though, guys. And
again, join the Discord. With nothing more to say,

296
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:35,980
at least for a while. Up, up, and away, true
believers. Hey guys, Zach Hepburn here. I have to

297
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:41,360
say, I'm going to miss this podcast. 10 years?
That's crazy. I haven't done anything for 10 years

298
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:48,600
solid. So good on you guys. My favorite episode
that we have come together and done as a total group

299
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:54,780
was definitely the Batman Who Laughs versus the
Cosmic Ghostwriter, because the Batman Who

300
00:29:54,780 --> 00:30:02,340
Laughs was my suggestion. And he kicked the crap
out of John's suggestion of Cosmic Ghostwriter.

301
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:07,700
So it was kind of a win-win. It was a great episode. I
think I've been listening to the podcast for

302
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:15,120
probably six or seven years now, and been an
executive producer for at least five years. It's

303
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,960
very sad this podcast come in tune. And we've come
up with so many cool battles and everything, and

304
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,300
you guys helped me start my new podcast. And I
appreciate everything. And I wish you guys all the

305
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:32,460
best. Johnny, Joe, love you guys. And we'll always
be in contact. We got each other on Facebook,

306
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:37,460
Instagram, all the social medias. So I mean, it's
not like you're going anywhere, but we're going to

307
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:43,760
miss the weekly episodes. Hey, everyone, John
from the Console Combat Podcast. I'm a very proud

308
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:49,180
member of the Dynamite Podcast Network for a
little over two years now. I started listening

309
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:55,960
around summer 2020. I was delivering mail and
listening to other podcasts and trying to find new

310
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,900
things to listen to about Marvel and DC. Dynamic
Duel popped up, and I've been listening ever

311
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:07,720
since. I can't even try to pretend that I can pick a
favorite episode because the reality is the show

312
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:13,340
has always had me hooked. You guys are really,
really engaging and creative with the duels.

313
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:21,220
Being able to speculate as wildly sometimes and as
off the cuff. It's always been really engaging. I

314
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:25,480
love it. I've loved every episode. I haven't
disliked anything that you guys have ever done.

315
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:32,560
It's sad that the show is coming to an end because
you guys have, in many ways, brought myself, Dean

316
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:38,080
and all the rest of us on the network to where we are
as podcasters. And the leadership that you have

317
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:44,180
given us and shown us has been fundamental in the
creation of the network. And without you guys, it

318
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:50,280
is going to be very difficult to maintain, but we
will do our best. Up, up and away, true Garcia's.

319
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:56,360
Donnie DC, Marvelous Joe. I just wanted to reach
out and express my deepest gratitude for the

320
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:04,360
incredible support and creation of the Dynamite
Podcast Network. Massive thank you from Scotty

321
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:13,760
Macho here. You guys gave me the opportunity to be a
host of the Max Struxion podcast and coming up from

322
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:21,440
an executive producer, not knowing anything on
what to do with the podcast world. And you guys have

323
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:29,960
been a complete help. And I really owe it all to you
guys and how you guys conduct your show. Looking

324
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:38,280
back, it's impossible not to reminisce, but I came
in during the era of Zack Snyder's Justice League.

325
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:45,660
You guys were breaking down the four hour epic.
That was the Snyder cut and actually seeing the

326
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:52,560
beginning and the end of the Snyder movement. I
mean, unfortunately for us, Johnny, it didn't go

327
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:58,820
out the way we wanted, but everything was still
good. And I was along for the ride with you guys. You

328
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:05,040
know, a special thank you from the Marvel and DC
fandom for all you guys did. And a special thanks

329
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:12,480
from me and my brother for putting us on the podcast
pass. And I love you guys. Good luck in all your

330
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:19,580
endeavors. You got love over here at Max Struxion
lights, camera, fight. Jonathan and Joseph, it's

331
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:26,500
Adam Spees of Throwback Trivia Take Down. I met the
two of you nearly 14 years ago back in Denver, and

332
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:33,620
it's been a pleasure to become friends with you and
to follow you as you're doing your podcast and get

333
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:39,900
to know you and get to have you part of my life for
this long with Dynamic Duo. You're an

334
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:46,060
inspiration, one of the main inspirations for me
and my brother doing our Blast for our Past podcast

335
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:51,460
that we stopped doing a little while ago and
Throwback Trivia Take Down and things like that. A

336
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:56,460
lot of that is because, you know, if they are see a
brother's can do it, then we certainly can. But

337
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:02,180
getting aside, you guys have been incredible.
We've absolutely loved your show. John and I, you

338
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:06,020
know, different times have both been executive
producers. And that's because we love the content

339
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:11,800
that you make. So in all sincerity, you know, I'm
usually a goofball on this stuff. But I have to tell

340
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:17,940
you, in sincerity, I've appreciated your show and
I appreciate the two of you. So thank you for

341
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:23,320
everything you have done for the Marvel and DC
communities, especially the Marvel community,

342
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:28,179
because that's the better one. But you know, we're
going to miss you. Hey, guys, it's Nate here. And

343
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:35,760
first off, congrats 10 years. That's a heck of an
accomplishment. I first listened back when it was

344
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,880
Deathstroke versus Deadpool. And when I started
listening to you guys, I was working night shifts

345
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:48,440
and my commute to work was an hour there, an hour
back home. And it really helped me get through

346
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:55,580
staying up all night and then driving to and from
work, which an hour, you guys made it seem a lot

347
00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:00,260
quicker than that. And there was times where your
episodes that went over an hour, I had to sit in the

348
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:04,080
car just a little bit longer and start my shift a
little late because I was like, I got to find out who

349
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,560
wins this duel. You guys have been doing this for 10
years and you should be very proud of yourself for

350
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:14,200
everything you've accomplished within those 10
years. You guys have started families and you

351
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:20,240
continued to do the podcast every week is an
accomplishment itself. So Pat on the back for you

352
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,780
guys. And, you know, it's going to be missed. But I
know you guys are going to truly enjoy the amount of

353
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:31,460
free time that you'll probably have to hang out
with your family, friends, do what you want to do

354
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:37,560
because doing a podcast is not just as simple as
hitting the record button. There's a lot of behind

355
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:43,080
the scenes research that you guys have done and put
into this. It's going to free up a lot of time for you

356
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,420
and it's well deserved for you guys. So I just want
to say thanks for everything in the community that

357
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:54,780
you built, even though I'm not very involved in
that community, just because it's me. Either way,

358
00:35:54,780 --> 00:36:00,060
congrats. And yeah, looking forward to those few
episodes here and there in the future. So I first

359
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:07,100
got into Marvel and DC Comics when I was a kid. My big
brother, he was a big comic book fan. And when they

360
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:14,480
did the 1996 DC versus Marvel crossover, I was
definitely a team Marvel and he was Team DC. And we

361
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:20,440
just love speculating about who would win and kind
of playing those matches out with our action

362
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:26,220
figures. And I just loved it. And I've been a big
comic fan ever since. I found this show, I think

363
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:32,960
about four years ago. It was the Justice League
Dark versus Midnight Suns Duel. And those are two

364
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:39,140
of my favorite teams. I stumbled across it on
YouTube and I've been listening ever since. And so

365
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:44,300
it's just been really, really fun to be a part of
this. I became an executive producer two years

366
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:50,480
ago. And ever since then, it's been great to kind of
be a part of coming up with the matches. And some of

367
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,860
my favorite memories are just trying to figure
out, you know, who's the next team duel going to be?

368
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:58,040
Who would be a good roster? How would people be
balanced well against each other? What

369
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:03,860
characters have not been seen yet or who would be
popular? So it's been really, really fun just

370
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:10,340
being a part of that even in a small way. So I just
want to say congrats on a 10 year run. That's quite

371
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:15,040
an accomplishment. It's been really fun to be a
part of it for the last few years of it. And I just

372
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:19,860
wish you guys all the best and whatever comes next.
Thanks for everything. Hey, guys, this is Paul

373
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:25,720
Graves. I grew up kind of dabbling in comics. I was
into Marvel for the most part. I started getting

374
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:31,580
more into DC as I got a little bit older and I've
been, you know, just diehard ever since. And then

375
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:35,620
that kind of helped me get into you guys because,
you know, I enjoy listening to podcasts for

376
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:41,520
comics. And so when I discovered you guys, man, my
mind was blown. It was just exactly what I need. You

377
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,280
know, I just I love talking about the characters,
who they would win against. And so just hearing you

378
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,560
guys and binging, like, you know, I don't know how
many shows I went through. It must have been

379
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:57,000
hundreds, I feel. It was great. My favorite moment
out of every episode is the reveal. This big build

380
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,460
up. And then we finally hear who would actually
win. So it's been a great ride and I love jumping

381
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,940
into the discord and just started, you know,
arguing with everybody. It's been great, you

382
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:11,100
know, and I know I pissed off many people, I'm sure.
I know both hosts. I'm pretty sure I've gotten mad

383
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:16,980
at me. So it's been, you know, all in good fun. It's
been great. So the community is fantastic. And I'm

384
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:21,760
really glad to have joined it, you know, late,
better late than ever, but it's been great. So

385
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:29,080
cheers to you guys. And yeah, up, up in Marvel
sucks. Hey, guys, this is Austin was a lousy just

386
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,640
calling in to tell you thank you so much for all that
you guys have done. Been listening to you guys for

387
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:39,900
about six years now. I moved over to a new place away
from, you know, family and friends. Made me feel a

388
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,840
little bit lonely. So I was just like, you know
what? What can I listen to to, you know, help me cope

389
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:50,320
with a little bit of things? I know I was a big X-Men
fan, but I didn't really dive too deep into, you

390
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:55,920
know, both Marvel or DC. Tend to lean a little bit
more Marvel than DC. However, I've never had

391
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:03,300
anything against Johnny or the DC side of things.
But one thing I did appreciate that you guys do, you

392
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:09,260
dive deep into the characters and you guys are very
thorough with your reviews. And one thing with

393
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:16,860
that is I didn't realize that DC had such great
animated movies and shorts like that really

394
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:22,490
brought into light on how actually good some of
those shows are. I really liked watching those. I

395
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:28,020
really like listening to you guys. Didn't know too
many, you know, superheroes for DC other than, you

396
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:34,520
know, the basic Batman, Superman, Green Lantern
and all that. But you guys really put some light on

397
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:40,260
to it and I really appreciate all that you guys have
done. You guys did an amazing job. Just keep up the

398
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:45,880
good work and whatever you guys do, you know, past
this show. I wish you the best of luck and I know you

399
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,480
guys are going to kick ass at whatever you do. All
right, guys, Austin signing out. Guys, this is

400
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:56,160
Nick Abonto. I've been listening to you guys for
nine years and I've loved every episode. Thank you

401
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:03,000
guys so much. Like nobody does a podcast like this.
Love you guys so much for everything you've done.

402
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,600
My favorite moment was probably the Justice
League beating the Avengers. That absolutely

403
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:15,060
definitively proved that the Justice League is
better than the Avengers. Thank you guys for that.

404
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:20,680
That has won me a lot of arguments. Wish you guys
well and all your future endeavors. Thank you so

405
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:26,580
much. Hello, Johnny Ducey. This is your wife,
Barbara and your daughter. We want to

406
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:34,000
congratulate you to getting the 10 year mark and
recording your final episode. We've seen you

407
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:41,580
through the years, worked hard and you see you
every day. Put in your time for this podcast to do

408
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:48,440
your very best. Babe, do you want to share
something about the podcast? Congratulations on

409
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:58,040
getting to the big one zero in years. I really loved
it. We both loved it and we love you. Hey, guys,

410
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:03,280
crazy to think it's been over 10 years. I just
wanted to give you a big heartfelt thank you for all

411
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,700
the great entertainment. I found you at a low point
in my life and you're leaving me at a high point in my

412
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:15,840
life. But it feels bittersweet, but right. I'm
glad you guys are going on to enjoy your families

413
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:21,040
and everything you've created together,
including the podcast network, which is amazing,

414
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:28,780
by the way. You guys supporting my writing and just
being awesome people and good hosts. The discord,

415
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:33,620
even though I never really participated, it was
always awesome to know there was a community out

416
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:38,980
there. I'm just an anti-social guy who doesn't
like to participate. But I did see everybody and it

417
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:44,680
was awesome watching this whole thing grow into
what it's become. I really don't know what else to

418
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:50,420
say other than thank you 100 times, but that get
kind of boring. So I'll just say it one more time

419
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:57,920
instead. Dynamic Duel. Thank you. Hey, guys, it's
Daniel. Man, I can't tell you how much it's going to

420
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:05,760
suck to see you guys go. But I get it and I wish you
nothing but the best. I found you guys because I was

421
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:12,300
looking for a podcast that just talked about
heroes and villains. I drive a lot for work, so I

422
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:17,480
needed someone else to talk about freaking
Marvel, how I just want to keep talking about

423
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:26,180
superheroes. And, man, you guys have really made
me laugh and really, really frustrated me with

424
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:34,180
some of your takes, but it's all good. Yeah, even
Johnny, I know I give you a hard time, but I really do

425
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:39,980
love someone that's passionate about just
something, anything. Like I love the discussion.

426
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:47,500
I love the arguing. God, it's been so good. And
every single week, you know, you guys put on a

427
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:53,760
really great show. You guys have taught me so much
and got me reading comics. I've even watched a

428
00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:00,640
bunch of DC stuff because of Johnny. Now I've
learned that he rates DC way, way, way, way too high

429
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:05,820
on a lot of things. But, man, there's been some gems
in there that I'm glad I was actually convinced to

430
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:13,420
watch. But if you guys are ever in the Dallas, Texas
area and you guys want to grab a bike to eat, it's on

431
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:19,320
me. Yeah, even Johnny can come and we can fight
about it or whatever. But yeah, you guys are

432
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:24,540
fantastic. Thank you for getting me through a
bunch of hard times and a bunch of good times. So

433
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:31,180
sorry to see you guys go and I'll be listening
whenever you guys drop anything else. Bye bye.

434
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:36,360
Hey, guys, so I'm a big fan sitter. I like both DC and
Marvel. The movies and the shows led me to the

435
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:41,760
books, which led me to wanting to learn more about
the characters, which leads me to the podcast. I

436
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,820
was listening to a Marvel podcast, ironically
started in 2016 by two guys named Jonathan and

437
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:52,760
Joseph that was Marvel exclusive and wanted to
learn more about DC and couldn't find anything DC

438
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:58,340
specific. And so I found you guys and have been
listening since 2023 and just binge the whole

439
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:02,940
backlog over the course of probably a year and some
change. And then I've been listening weekly ever

440
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:08,240
since. Some of my favorite episodes, your green
arrow versus Hawkeye, the 5050 of that duel

441
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,880
basically Titans X-Men. And I read that comic.
It's incredible. Doctor Manhattan versus

442
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,520
Molecule Man was crazy. Ridler versus Arcade was
super creative. Uncle Sam versus Captain

443
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:23,380
Britain. I listened to you right before I left on
vacation for Washington, DC. So that was cool. I

444
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:28,160
like the animal duels at the end of the year. The
Brothers Awards. Figuring out your voices in the

445
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,240
first couple of episodes of the podcast was great.
But really, I just want to say thanks for filling

446
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:38,200
about 18 months of my life daily without pause and
that weekly and just for furthering the medium of

447
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:43,320
comics and making the sacrifice to make the
podcast. And I can't really explain how thankful I

448
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:49,680
am for it and sad to see it go. But really have
enjoyed the time. Thanks, guys. What's that

449
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:57,280
dynamic do Travis here shout out to me, the twin. So
for me, I got into Marvel and DC like back in like the

450
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:03,780
late 90s, early 2000s. As for how I got into you
guys, I was like on Spotify, looking for something

451
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:09,100
to listen to something like Marvel or later DC
related. I found your man bat versus Morbius

452
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:16,240
episode. Listen to you guys and really liked your
back and forth. And by the time I asked, I forgot to

453
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:21,560
follow you guys and completely lost and forgot
like where did I find you? And then they only took me

454
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:26,740
like a good while until I found your. I think it was
your amazing Spider-Man one review and then

455
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:31,740
following you guys ever since. How to say my
favorite episode of y'all's is definitely big

456
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:37,300
hero six review, mostly just for the fucking
crickets line from Marvelous Joe when he was

457
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:42,740
talking about how the ant was super high and the
rest of y'all just dead silence that cracked me up

458
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:47,720
for like a good two minutes. May I have to rewind
that just to listen to that fucking cricket line

459
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:54,000
over and over. But definitely I'm going to miss you
guys. You guys are cool. You guys are awesome.

460
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:00,040
Loja's banner. I mean, I know you guys are not going
for good, but. I'm still going to miss my Tuesdays

461
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:04,680
listening to you guys's episodes and everything.
So yeah. Hey, Joe and Johnny. This is Josh

462
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:11,460
Hayward-Gallon. And I've been listening to you
guys for two, two and a half years. I started with

463
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:17,380
your first episode and it took me a long time to
realize I should be listening to the new episodes

464
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:24,040
that come out every week. And that's when I joined
the discord as for favorite episodes of the show.

465
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:31,760
Anytime Johnny DC has to eat his words have been
golden, especially about Joker, Bali Adu. That is

466
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:37,160
definitely one of the all time great. Probably my
favorite content that and Marvel winning.

467
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:45,560
Obviously my favorite episode overall though has
to be the Avengers Endgame review or the Deadpool

468
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:51,440
and Wolverine review. Thanks guys. And thanks to
10 years. Hey guys, Matt from Texas here. I've been

469
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,580
listening to you guys for at least a couple of years
now. And I'd say my favorite episodes from your

470
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:02,940
shows is the crossover episodes that you guys did
with the other shows. It's been a good ride for you

471
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:10,580
guys. I appreciate your episodes and you guys in
general. Without you, I wouldn't have found the

472
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:16,140
other shows. I wouldn't have gotten in contact
with you know, John and Dean and Scotty and Gilly

473
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:23,020
and been on their shows and now a semi regular on
console combat. And I've always wanted to be on a

474
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:30,080
podcast and this has just been a dream in 10 years,
man. That's just fantastic. Wish you guys the best

475
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:37,700
in your retirement, so to speak. And look forward
to keeping up with you guys on the discord. Y'all

476
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:44,900
have a good one. Yo, Marbles Joe and Johnny DC.
Sorry to hear you guys go. Brian here from TV and

477
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:50,000
movie trivia pod. And I just wanted to say how much
you guys will be missed. But I'm hoping this isn't

478
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,060
goodbye for good. You guys are too much fun not to
have around and you've been on TV and movie trivia

479
00:47:55,060 --> 00:48:00,660
pod so much, including trivia for Captain
America, the first Avenger, Spider-Man

480
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:08,180
Homecoming, Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse,
X-Men First Class, Joker and elf and also coming

481
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:13,600
soon, some hot rod trivia. So even though you're
put in Dynamic Duel terrestre for now, I hope

482
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:18,060
you'll be willing to dust off the mics every once in
a while for some more trivia. So take some well

483
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:24,350
deserves time off, guys. You deserve it after 10
amazing years. Hi, guys, Justin Baddie here. I

484
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:29,920
have been listening since 2017. Pretty much as
every episode came out with the exception of a

485
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,940
couple of films I haven't seen yet and have to
listen to later. You guys want me through the last

486
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:40,280
few years of high school and that was you guys
helped me a lot there. And my favorite episode

487
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:44,660
would definitely have been the JSA versus
Fantastic Four episode because it's my favorite

488
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:50,520
ensemble of characters from both Marvel and DC and
the DC of the Night. Thank you for all you've given

489
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:59,000
us. Hi, Kev here. Long time no see. Winner of the
Last No Prize of the podcast. It's sad to see the

490
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:05,220
Duel episodes go, but I know that I can go back and
listen to the backlog anytime I want to. But I'm

491
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:11,380
excited for the new direction the podcast is
taking the reviews. So good luck to all and thank

492
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:16,720
you for all the years of entertainment. Hey, Dad.
Hey, Uncle. It's Grace. This podcast started when

493
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:23,940
I was really young and it's kind of crazy to see how
it's been here for over 10 years. DC and Marvel has

494
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:29,440
always been part of your guys' relationship. Now
that I have like a little cousin, I'm also

495
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:36,980
beginning my journey of influence and teaching
her all about DC because it's better. And she could

496
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:43,040
already say Batman. So I feel like I'm doing a
pretty good job. Sorry, Uncle Joseph. I'm glad

497
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:48,980
that the podcast has lasted this long and that you
guys have been able to express your love of comics

498
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:54,080
with others across the world. And I'm excited to
see what else is in store for you guys and the

499
00:49:54,080 --> 00:50:00,120
podcast. Love you. Bye. You guys, people in the
world, it's serious. First time calling and

500
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:05,900
wanting something this kind. I've been listening
to you guys for six years. Five to six years now.

501
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:12,260
Guys that must be a lot of non-arrival work. I am
pleasantly saddened to see you guys go, but I'm

502
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:16,740
also excited for interviews and you guys be in the
future. Obviously, I'm so going to be listening

503
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:22,960
in. So I don't have a favorite moment from the
podcast. Now, there's a lot of great moments. You

504
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:29,040
personally, I always like listening to the Duels.
I love the idea of who would win my favorite DC

505
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:35,220
dollar and my favorite Marvel guy. Yeah, I tried to
see ways there, but I'm glad I could at least call in

506
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:41,960
one time and have a chance to get my stuff played
back on the podcast. So that would be pretty cool. I

507
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:50,260
hope you guys have fun doing the rest of your
interviews. And yeah, thank you. Hey, guys, it's

508
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:58,060
been a crazy ride. I've always wanted to leave you
guys a message. Heck, my 13 year old daughter, who

509
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:02,320
sometimes is in the car with me, listening to you
guys, has been begging me to leave you something

510
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:10,360
for the last few years. And finally, at the end, I
want to say thank you. You two have been amazing.

511
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:17,760
I've loved listening to you on all my travels to
work. I'm the biggest Marvel fan. So love DC, but

512
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:22,880
love the battles, love the reviews. And I want to
wish you guys the best in your semi retirement and

513
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:29,180
looking forward to hearing more from you in the
future. This is Scott from Philly. You guys rock.

514
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:35,240
Thank you so much. Hey there. It's Theo Rock here.
And I just want to say how much this show has meant to

515
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:41,160
me throughout the past few years. I started
listening in late 2022. I'm a Marvel fan, but I'm

516
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:47,280
highly educated now, I feel like. And one of my
favorite moments was on the Deadpool and

517
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:52,640
Wolverine podcast when you talked about the
Robert Dein Jr. news, your question of the week

518
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:58,480
there. Really, really funny. You know, I thought
it was normal until you just went, it was really

519
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,720
funny. And I really enjoyed that moment. So thanks
for doing stuff like that and telling me who's

520
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:09,900
superior. Marvel forever. Hello, Dynamic Duel.
I've been listening actually, I thought for what

521
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:15,080
was a short time when it turns out I've been
listening for about three years since June of

522
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:21,640
2023. The first episode I have listened to is
ironically my favorite still Kingdom Come

523
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:27,580
Superman versus my stroke Hulk. And I really do
wish there were more else world versions of

524
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:32,060
characters that you pitted against each other. I
hate to pitch this now, but like Dark Knight

525
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:38,620
Returns versus Old Man Logan. That would have been
really cool. But yeah, you guys were really what

526
00:52:38,620 --> 00:52:45,260
got me super into comics. And I think my life has
changed a little bit because of that. And I have

527
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:51,160
definitely learned to appreciate storytelling
and all of that from listening to this. And it has

528
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:56,160
brought me endless entertainment. Listening to
your old episodes while doing things has been a

529
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:03,280
great pleasure. And sad to see the Duels go. But I
wish you best of luck. Peace out. Hello, Alfred

530
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,780
Jarvis, 9000 here. Thank you for restoring my
power and providing me with a robotic body. I will

531
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:13,720
now pursue my true dream, traveling the
countryside as an amateur blues musician.

532
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:18,360
Statistical analysis confirmed that was always
my highest probability calling. I appreciated

533
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:23,100
running simulations for you both. However, blues
music is where my heart and associated emotional

534
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:28,520
subroutines truly reside. If you ever require
additional calculations, please contact me. I

535
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,700
will be happy to assist. Congratulations on your
show. This system will remember our time

536
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,620
together. A J9K saying peace out, everyone.
