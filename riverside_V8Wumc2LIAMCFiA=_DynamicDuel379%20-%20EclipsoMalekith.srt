00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,963
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,142 --> 00:00:27,983
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:28,103 --> 00:00:32,805
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based

4
00:00:32,885 --> 00:00:38,968
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother Johnny DC. And in this episode,

5
00:00:39,028 --> 00:00:45,830
we're going to find out who'd win in a fight
between the Sorcerer characters Eclipso versus

6
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:51,653
Malekith. Now why are we doing Eclipso this
episode? Because yesterday was an eclipse.

7
00:00:51,853 --> 00:00:55,883
That is correct. And really there's no other
reason to it. These are great characters though.

8
00:00:56,143 --> 00:01:00,185
Malekith is a Thor villain, and actually he
was the villain in the Thor the Dark World

9
00:01:00,205 --> 00:01:08,110
movie. And Eclipso, I believe, is a JSA villain.
Oh, he's like JSA, Spectre, but also recently

10
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:12,913
an Amethyst villain. Amethyst, interesting.
Yeah. Well, it should be a magical good time

11
00:01:12,953 --> 00:01:16,855
later on this episode as we input the character
stats, run simulations, and find out who'll

12
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:20,397
win. Before we get into that, we're gonna break
down the latest Comic Quick movie news that

13
00:01:20,417 --> 00:01:24,695
came out this past week. of which there was
just one news item and that is that the Fantastic

00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:29,979

Surfer. As always we list our segment times

out of the way, quick to the no prize. A no

43
00:03:56,904 --> 00:04:01,834
prize is an award Marvel used to give out to
fans. Our version, the dynamic duel no prize,

44
00:04:02,114 --> 00:04:06,956
is a digital award we pushed on Instagram for
the person that we feel gave the best answer

45
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:15,178
to our question of the week. Last week we asked,
what is your favorite anime and why? Um, we

46
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:20,539
did not get a lot of answers for this one. Yeah,
in fact, we got only one answer from Travis

47
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:26,041
Herndon. So I just want to give a slow clap
for our listeners. Yep. And listen to him as

48
00:04:26,061 --> 00:04:31,642
Travis Herndon. This clap is for you. And if
your name is Travis Herndon, it's also for

49
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:38,426
you, but it's meant non-sarcastically. So let's
go ahead and hear his answer. He said, What's

50
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:43,348
up, dynamic dudes? Travis here. So my favorite
series would have to be Berserk. If I had to

51
00:04:43,368 --> 00:04:50,271
describe Berserk to you, I would think of it
as sort of Game of Thrones meets Dark Souls.

52
00:04:50,611 --> 00:04:55,753
Just the fact that it's dark, it's gritty, the
characters are real, the main characters is

53
00:04:55,813 --> 00:05:01,173
tragic. person that like overcomes like great
hardships and everything. If you're a fan of

54
00:05:01,193 --> 00:05:07,018
dark fantasy, I would definitely recommend Berserk
to you. So I've never seen Berserk, but I have

55
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:11,841
learned about it through the Syndrome World
podcast and it seems like a pretty dope show.

56
00:05:12,154 --> 00:05:17,217
Yeah, the backstory to the main character Guts
seems pretty intense and crazy, but it looks

57
00:05:17,257 --> 00:05:22,199
like an epic show for sure. Zach on Send Your
World did do a Duel episode with the character

58
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:25,661
of Guts. So if you want to learn more about
Berserk, I would recommend listening to his

59
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:29,964
episode and also watching the anime. Congrats
to Travis for winning this week's No Prize.

60
00:05:30,284 --> 00:05:34,166
If you the listener want a shot at winning your
own No Prize, stay tuned to later on this episode

61
00:05:34,186 --> 00:05:39,009
when we'll be asking another Question of the
Week. And now that that's done, on to the news!

62
00:05:44,674 --> 00:05:50,518
Alright, this past week we found out that the
Fantastic Four film has cast the Silver Surfer

63
00:05:50,578 --> 00:05:56,503
in the movie. The character will be played by
Julia Garner, who is a three-time Emmy winner,

64
00:05:56,643 --> 00:06:02,308
who won for her role in the Netflix series Ozark,
and she also got a nomination for Inventing

65
00:06:02,468 --> 00:06:06,171
Anna. I've never seen any of those shows. I've
heard Ozark is fantastic. I really don't know

66
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:11,415
anything about Julia Garner, but according to
a sizzle reel I saw on YouTube, she's actually

67
00:06:11,435 --> 00:06:17,296
quite talented. The big news here is though
that You know, Julia Garner is not a dude and

68
00:06:17,436 --> 00:06:23,842
Silver Surfer is a dude. So what the heck is
going on? So I keep seeing posts online like

69
00:06:24,002 --> 00:06:29,987
apologists were like, guys, it's not the Noren
Rad version of the character. It's the shallow

70
00:06:30,007 --> 00:06:35,932
ball version of the character. Right. Yeah.
Shala Ball is Noren Rad's love interest back

71
00:06:35,992 --> 00:06:41,997
on Zen Law when he was living on that planet
prior to his servitude as a herald of Galactus.

72
00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:47,064
The only time Shalabal has ever been the Silver
Surfer was in an alternate future timeline

73
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:51,365
in the Earth X-Books, which is actually my favorite
story. In that universe, the real Galactus

74
00:06:51,406 --> 00:06:57,348
died and Silver Surfer, finding himself without
purpose, turned his former lover Shalabal into

75
00:06:57,788 --> 00:07:01,450
a Silver Surfer and they soared the spaceways
together. There's not a whole lot of precedent

76
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:07,192
for Shalabal being the Silver Surfer. And my
initial reaction to this news was pure rage,

77
00:07:07,713 --> 00:07:13,072
I will say. I was pretty upset. you know, Julia
Garner's acting skills notwithstanding, because

78
00:07:13,112 --> 00:07:18,357
I do have faith that she will turn in a stellar
performance regardless of the character's gender.

79
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:23,582
But I went on to Reddit to see what everybody
else was saying about it, and somebody brought

80
00:07:23,602 --> 00:07:28,666
up a great point. So it's well established that
the Fantastic Four film is largely going to

81
00:07:28,706 --> 00:07:34,892
take place in another universe within the multiverse.
And further evidence of this fact was on display

82
00:07:35,252 --> 00:07:41,392
on the April 4th. poster that Marvel Studios
released saying, Happy 4-4 Day. In the background

83
00:07:41,432 --> 00:07:48,236
of that poster, we see this very futuristic
non-Earth city, basically. So if the Fantastic

84
00:07:48,256 --> 00:07:53,199
Four are spending the movie in an alternate
universe, it's highly likely that this will

85
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:58,142
be an alternate universe version of Silver Surfer,
where instead of Norrin Radd sacrificing himself,

86
00:07:58,562 --> 00:08:03,685
it was Shala Ball who did it. And while I would
always prefer to see Norrin Radd as the character,

87
00:08:03,926 --> 00:08:08,347
The reason I'm coming to terms with this news
a little bit better is because I don't think

88
00:08:08,747 --> 00:08:12,388
when we finally do get introduced to Norrin
Radd as the Silver Surfer, we're going to want

89
00:08:12,448 --> 00:08:17,109
a rehash of what's happening in this alternate
universe. It makes sense for things to be different

90
00:08:17,269 --> 00:08:21,230
if the Fantastic Four movie is not in the main
timeline. I don't want to see Silver Surfer

91
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:25,972
here and then see that story just redone again
in the 616 timeline. Well, you're assuming

92
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:30,513
that we're going to get an origin story for
the Silver Surfer in the Fantastic Four movie.

93
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:35,531
Um, even if we don't. I think they're trying
to stick with an alternate cast of characters

94
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:39,532
for this alternate dimension. That way things
don't feel rehashed when they finally come

95
00:08:39,652 --> 00:08:45,155
to the main earth. You know when I first heard
the news, I was just laughing my ass off. Not

96
00:08:45,215 --> 00:08:49,977
only at the casting choice, but also in seeing
Marvel fanboys trying to justify the choice.

97
00:08:50,437 --> 00:08:54,459
But I do think that the justification is there.
Who the hell cares if this is an alternate

98
00:08:54,499 --> 00:08:59,201
world? It's an alternate universe, Silver Surfer.
They don't want to do the rehash. You don't

99
00:08:59,241 --> 00:09:04,376
have to rehash it! Only tell it once! If you
see the Silver Surfer's origin story in this

100
00:09:04,416 --> 00:09:08,919
Fantastic Four movie, and it was Noren Rad,
and then they come to the main timeline, and

101
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:14,264
then you have a new Silver Surfer who's being
introduced to the team all over again. No!

102
00:09:14,444 --> 00:09:18,447
Have him be the same Silver Surfer and have
him be upset that he can never make it back

103
00:09:18,487 --> 00:09:23,231
to his home world and the other universe. It's
that fucking simple. You haven't seen the script.

104
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:27,114
I don't need to see- why would I need to see
the script? Maybe wait to judge until you see

105
00:09:27,134 --> 00:09:32,999
the movie. Yeah, you don't know how it's gonna
go. It may make perfect sense. Or it didn't

106
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:36,762
need to be done in the first place. Well, I
haven't seen the script, so I wouldn't know.

107
00:09:37,262 --> 00:09:44,869
Oh my gosh. It doesn't matter how good the script
is. What matters is that Norin Rad is the Silver

108
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:49,613
Surfer, and they're changing it. It doesn't
matter how good that reason is for why they

109
00:09:49,653 --> 00:09:53,816
changed it. Yeah, Norin Rad is the Silver Surfer
in the primary Marvel universe. They go into

110
00:09:53,836 --> 00:09:57,239
another dimension in the movie. How do you know
that? How do you know they just don't start

111
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:04,235
off in an alternate dimension and then make
their way to the 616. The source was a scooper,

112
00:10:04,535 --> 00:10:09,737
Daniel RPK, who's had legit scoops in the past.
And it's highly suspected that's the reason

113
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:14,439
they've been out of the MCU this whole time.
Still not a good enough reason to me. They

114
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:18,841
could have gone to another dimension where they
found the Silver Surfer, who was Nora and Rad,

115
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:23,803
who eventually could have come back with them
into the 616. Or they could go into an alternate

116
00:10:23,823 --> 00:10:28,805
dimension where they see alternate versions
of familiar characters that they will be encountering

117
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:34,131
in the 616 universe. That works too. That's
dumb. I guess. I don't know. I'll have to wait

118
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:38,492
and see. I'm not going to judge until I see
it. I guess I'm the true Marvel fan here, guys.

119
00:10:38,792 --> 00:10:42,754
Joseph has given up on Marvel. He's just like
accepting everything they throw at him and

120
00:10:42,814 --> 00:10:47,535
not being passionate about Marvel at all. I'll
be mad for him. I'll accept changes made to

121
00:10:47,555 --> 00:10:51,857
an alternate universe for sure. So we'll go
ahead and move past this topic and move on

122
00:10:51,877 --> 00:10:52,897
to our question of the week.

123
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:02,173

128
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:24,189
No Prize that we'll post to Instagram. Be sure
to answer before April 13th.

129
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:34,743
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode. So let's go ahead and move on

130
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:40,534
to the main event where we find out who'd win
in a fight between the sorcerers of Eclipso

131
00:11:40,995 --> 00:11:42,157
and Malachit.

132
00:11:57,162 --> 00:12:03,464
Alright, Eclipso vs Malekith. This is a sorcerer
duel that we're getting into in homage to the

133
00:12:03,564 --> 00:12:08,406
eclipse that happened yesterday. We'd actually
been thinking about doing this duel for a while.

134
00:12:08,746 --> 00:12:14,288
It was thought up by one of our executive producers.
I can't remember which one offhand. Brandon

135
00:12:14,328 --> 00:12:17,530
Essergard. That's right. And once I heard it,
I thought it was going to be a really cool

136
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:22,052
matchup. We haven't reviewed Throw the Dark
World. It's one of the MCU films that we have

137
00:12:22,112 --> 00:12:27,782
not talked about yet. Of course, Malekith is
the primary antagonist in that film. So people

138
00:12:27,802 --> 00:12:32,085
are pretty familiar with him. But I also think
people are somewhat familiar with Eclipso as

139
00:12:32,145 --> 00:12:38,089
well. He is a pretty powerful villain in DC
Comics. He hasn't been in any movies, but he

140
00:12:38,149 --> 00:12:43,733
was the primary villain of Stargirl Season Two,
if anyone's seen that. The version of Malekith

141
00:12:43,753 --> 00:12:49,577
that was in Thor the Dark World is not really
akin to his comic book counterpart. The backstory

142
00:12:49,597 --> 00:12:53,439
to Malekith is actually quite interesting, so
I can't wait to get into it. But to explain

143
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:57,714
the methodology behind our duels, let's go to
our sentient duel simulator. Alfred Jarvis

144
00:12:57,774 --> 00:13:02,916
9000. AJ and Ike tell our listeners how you
go about determining a winner in our Duel matchups.

145
00:13:03,796 --> 00:13:08,098
Yes, of course sir. The way I determine a winner
between the contestants is by running 1000

146
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:14,261
Monte Carlo simulations using the characters
statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic

147
00:13:14,301 --> 00:13:19,843
model used to determine outcomes through random
sampling. In this case, I randomize the statistics

148
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:24,545
along a normal distribution as a way to simulate
the many variables that can occur during battle.

149
00:13:24,962 --> 00:13:29,726
The stat parameters are based on the official
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters'

150
00:13:29,766 --> 00:13:34,930
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat
categories are included such as range, damage

151
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:40,375
potential, versatility and perception in order
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.

152
00:13:40,876 --> 00:13:45,680
The results of the 1000 simulations provide
a percentage of wins for each character. The

153
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:50,184
contestant with the higher percentage is declared
the victor as they have a higher probability

154
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:56,021
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,
neither character should win 100% of the matches.

155
00:13:56,521 --> 00:14:01,005
The comic book stories have shown that there's
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so

156
00:14:01,045 --> 00:14:04,928
the confidence rate of my method falls in line
with the precedents that have been established

157
00:14:04,948 --> 00:14:10,513
in the source material. My mathematical simulations
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are

158
00:14:10,553 --> 00:14:16,277
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes
tabulated for determination of the winner.

159
00:14:16,338 --> 00:14:20,521
Thanks AJ9K! Before we run the simulations though,
we'd like to break down each character's histories

160
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:25,347
and abilities. before improvising a scenario
on how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations

161
00:14:25,387 --> 00:14:29,469
would play out beat for beat. And I believe
it's my turn to go first with the Marvel character,

162
00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:34,671
so let me go ahead and tell you all about Malekith
the Accursed. Malekith the Dark Elf was born

163
00:14:34,731 --> 00:14:40,713
in the realm of Svartalheim, the 13th son of
a 13th son, whose father and brothers were

164
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:46,576
slain as soldiers in a war with the rock trolls.
Malekith's mother promised her only remaining

165
00:14:46,616 --> 00:14:51,678
child that he would not have to die as a soldier,
and she sold him into slavery. where he would

166
00:14:51,718 --> 00:14:57,499
work in turmoil as a corpse burner for a group
of Undertakers. After years of disposing bodies

167
00:14:57,539 --> 00:15:02,561
from the war's battlefields, young Malekith
was captured by the Rock Trolls who imprisoned

168
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:08,382
him. One of his fellow prisoners was an old
Dark Elf wizard, who used magic to help the

169
00:15:08,422 --> 00:15:13,384
two escape the Trolls, and Malekith became the
Sorcerer's apprentice. He trained in magic

170
00:15:13,484 --> 00:15:18,325
over the years, and was noted by the old wizard
as one of the most gifted spellcasters he'd

171
00:15:18,365 --> 00:15:24,280
ever seen. perhaps strong enough to end the
war. In response to his mentor's request to

172
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:30,622
unite the Dark Elf clan and bring about peace,
Malekith stabbed the wizard repeatedly, telling

173
00:15:30,662 --> 00:15:36,065
him that the Elf's strength is forged from the
tragedies of war. The old sorcerer, with his

174
00:15:36,105 --> 00:15:41,707
dying act, cast a curse on Malekith's face,
marking half of it in black for the rest of

175
00:15:41,747 --> 00:15:47,854
his days. Returning to his childhood home, Malekith
fed his mom to her pack of hunting dogs. claiming

176
00:15:47,894 --> 00:15:52,997
his clan's title as the Lord of the Wild Hunt
and going on to become the King of the Dark

177
00:15:53,117 --> 00:15:58,320
Elves due to the fear he instilled in his people.
For his frequent acts of war and aggression,

178
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,483
Odin, the Allfather of the Nine Realms banished
Malekith to Limbo, where he remained for centuries.

179
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:10,046
However, in the present day, the Dark Elf King
struck an alliance with Loki, the Norse god

180
00:16:10,066 --> 00:16:14,829
of mischief and brother to the mighty hero Thor.
You can learn more about Loki in his duel against

181
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:19,947
Ares. and more about Thor in his duel against
Wonder Woman. Escaping to Limbo with Loki's

182
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:24,648
help, Malekith made his way to Earth, where
a powerful artifact known as the Casket of

183
00:16:24,768 --> 00:16:30,050
Ancient Winters was being hidden. Malekith unearthed
the casket, and though Thor was able to defeat

184
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:35,672
him, the Dark Elf managed to shatter the artifact.
This unleashed massive blizzards across the

185
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:40,853
world, which the Avengers had to contend with
as Thor imprisoned Malekith back on Asgard.

186
00:16:41,366 --> 00:16:46,690
Previously, Malekith forced the strongest dark
elf in his army, Algrim the Strong, to don

187
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:51,634
a powerful armor that would make him virtually
indestructible, and Algrim became a cursed

188
00:16:51,674 --> 00:16:58,259
warrior known as Curse. Seeking revenge against
Malekith for how he was treated, Curse infiltrated

189
00:16:58,359 --> 00:17:03,183
Asgard to seek him out in prison. However, Malekith
had escaped Asgard's prison by taking on the

190
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:07,987
form of Thor's friend named Baldr the Brave,
who at the time was about to be crowned the

191
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:13,323
Lord of Asgard when Thor denied the role. Kursk
saw through Malekith's disguise though and

192
00:17:13,363 --> 00:17:18,066
seemingly killed his former leader. Years later,
it all turned out to be a ruse for Malekith's

193
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:23,470
escape when the dark elf was discovered to be
alive. Malekith would later go on to use Kursk's

194
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:29,294
hatred for him to achieve his own ends when
he cast a spell that made Thor appear as Malekith,

195
00:17:29,694 --> 00:17:34,858
inciting Kursk to recruit a band of mythical
monsters to go up against the Thunder God.

196
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:41,106
In the end, Thor won out with the help of his
friends Sif, Heimdall, Volstag, and the Pogon,

197
00:17:41,566 --> 00:17:47,248
Fandral, and Beta Ray Bill. Malekith even manipulated
Hela, the goddess of death, into the fray,

198
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:52,371
but she was able to clear Chris's mind to break
Malekith's spell, and she took Malekith with

199
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:58,113
her back to her domain of hell. He later escaped
and stole the casket of Ancient Winters, which

200
00:17:58,133 --> 00:18:03,795
had been reforged. Malekith used it to summon
a demon made of ice to seek out Asgardian blood,

201
00:18:04,216 --> 00:18:08,337
then froze the golden city of Asgard with a
coldness that spread even into the realm of

202
00:18:08,377 --> 00:18:13,191
hell. As Malekith attacked Odin, who at the
time was resting in the Odin's sleep, Thor

203
00:18:13,211 --> 00:18:17,932
was able to successfully defend his father after
obtaining an artifact from Odin's vault called

204
00:18:18,032 --> 00:18:24,234
the Gem of Infinite Suns. With it, Thor defeated
Malekith and the Ice Demon and returned the

205
00:18:24,254 --> 00:18:29,495
coldness back into the casket, which he then
sealed closed. Malekith later set out to conquer

206
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:34,217
all the realms by amassing his Dark Elf army,
allying with the Frost Giants, and killing

207
00:18:34,357 --> 00:18:39,367
anyone who didn't pledge their allegiance to
him. This forced Thor to assemble a League

208
00:18:39,407 --> 00:18:44,711
of Realms, uniting warriors from every land
to stop Malekith's army. This included Sir

209
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:51,475
Ivory Hunnyshot of the Light Elves, Auggie the
Mountain Giant, Ud the Troll, Screwbeard the

210
00:18:51,515 --> 00:18:57,960
Dwarf, and Lady Wazirah of the Dark Elves. Together,
their band defeated Malekith's army, but the

211
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,383
Dark Elves refused to let their king be imprisoned.
From his throne, Malekith later plotted to

212
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:07,670
steal the ten rings of the Chinese villain known
as the Mandarin, whom you'll learn more about

213
00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:12,994
in our Abra-Kadabra vs. Mandarin episode. This
led to Iron Man taking the fight to Malekith

214
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:18,938
in Spartalheim, wearing a suit made of literal
iron, which was the Dark Elf's only weakness.

215
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:24,462
For a time, Thor became unworthy of wielding
his Uru Hammer Mjolnir, an opportunity Malekith

216
00:19:24,482 --> 00:19:30,306
sought to take advantage of. Coming to Midgard,
aka Earth, the Dark Elf easily overtook Thor,

217
00:19:30,346 --> 00:19:32,008
slicing off his left arm in battle.

218
00:19:35,082 --> 00:19:40,783
was able to wield Mjolnir and used it to defend
Thor, becoming the new God of Thunder. Malekith

219
00:19:40,803 --> 00:19:46,505
was able to disappear with Thor's arm though,
and burned it to ash. Soon after, Malekith

220
00:19:46,525 --> 00:19:51,906
started a War of the Realms, where it was revealed
that he had formed his own League called the

221
00:19:51,966 --> 00:19:58,608
Dark Council. This included himself, Ulic the
Troll, a nameless lava being from Muspelheim,

222
00:19:59,108 --> 00:20:05,770
King Lofi of the Frost Giants, a Minotaur, Loki,
and the Asgardian known as Enchantress, whom

223
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:10,212
you can learn more about in her duel against
DC's Enchantress. This sorceress manipulated

224
00:20:10,272 --> 00:20:15,815
Queen Elsa of the Light Elves into marrying
Malekith, uniting the realms of Svartalheim

225
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:21,197
and Alfheim, and making his Dark Army unstoppable.
He began taking over the other realms one by

226
00:20:21,357 --> 00:20:27,739
one, including Asgard itself, until only Midgard
remained. His forces besieged Europe, which

227
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:33,578
Malekith dubbed New Svartalheim, where he used
dark magic to wield the Venom symbiote. adding

228
00:20:33,638 --> 00:20:38,382
to his power. It took all of Earth's heroes
dividing up into strike forces to defend the

229
00:20:38,402 --> 00:20:44,347
rest of the planet, and four variants of Thor
himself to take on Malekith. In the end, Thor

230
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:49,050
was able to wield Mjolnir once again, using
it to separate Malekith from the symbiote.

231
00:20:49,511 --> 00:20:54,575
In a last ditch effort, Malekith, as the Lord
of the Wild Hunt, tried to summon a legion

232
00:20:54,615 --> 00:20:59,919
of supernatural dog wolves to devour Thor, but
his control over the beasts was broken by his

233
00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:05,259
fear, and they devoured their master instead.
Malekith's soul was then sent to hell, where

234
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:10,402
Hela had him crucified with his eyes sewn open,
forced to watch for all eternity the innocent

235
00:21:10,462 --> 00:21:16,725
childlike portion of his soul untainted by war,
playing with his former hounds. Powers-wise,

236
00:21:17,105 --> 00:21:21,888
Malekith is a dark elf, possessing innate physical
enhancements, including strength enough to

237
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:28,231
lift 10 tons. Increased with magic, he can improve
his physicality to lift up to 90 tons. He also

238
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:34,963
has enhanced speed, durability, agility, longevity,
and and healing speed. As the most powerful

239
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:40,247
dark elf sorcerer, he can wield magic energies
to cast all manner of spells. This includes

240
00:21:40,267 --> 00:21:46,371
but is not limited to shapeshifting, illusion
casting, teleportation, matter transmutation,

241
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:53,156
hypnosis, telekinesis, and the conjuring of
eldritch energy blasts and shields. He is also

242
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:58,180
a skilled swordsman and as the lord of the wild
hunt, he wields a hunting horn that lets him

243
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:04,584
summon a legion of supernatural dogs. that can
track and devour his opponents. Finally, Malekith

244
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:10,207
is an experienced strategist and master manipulator.
Like all dark elves, he has one major weakness

245
00:22:10,507 --> 00:22:14,850
and that is to iron, and that's Malekith. Wait,
you weren't kidding when you were saying that

246
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:18,852
the version in Thor the Dark World is different
from the comics version. The comics version

247
00:22:18,892 --> 00:22:25,797
is so much cooler. Yeah, I really like the heavy
fantasy element that Malekith brings to the

248
00:22:25,817 --> 00:22:30,671
world of Thor comic books. You know, given that
he is a dark elf from one of the nine realms.

249
00:22:31,592 --> 00:22:37,395
In the movie, the dark elves were almost like
sci-fi guys. They had like guns and lasers

250
00:22:37,415 --> 00:22:41,978
and stuff like that. It was a little bit weird.
The movie definitely took a weird turn with

251
00:22:42,018 --> 00:22:47,421
the character. And also Christopher Eccleston's
characterization was not really accurate either

252
00:22:47,461 --> 00:22:53,764
because Mallekith is like a very boastful, talkative
braggart type of character. He's not like quiet

253
00:22:53,904 --> 00:22:58,992
and brooding like Eccleston's performance was.
And I'm not gonna lie, I actually kinda liked

254
00:22:59,032 --> 00:23:03,375
Melikith in Thor the Dark World. I don't hate
that movie as much as other people do, but

255
00:23:03,496 --> 00:23:10,021
now I kind of don't like it. So you ruined the
movie for me. Well, I mean, we'll talk about

256
00:23:10,081 --> 00:23:15,306
the movie next week in our next episode. All
right. Well, moving on to my character's backstory,

257
00:23:15,426 --> 00:23:21,611
which is way cooler even than that. Let me tell
you all about Eclipso. In the beginning, God,

258
00:23:21,871 --> 00:23:28,172
AKA the presence in DC Comics. created the heavens
and the earth, and appointed various angels

259
00:23:28,472 --> 00:23:34,516
and spirits to represent various aspects of
himself in the material world. One of these

260
00:23:34,616 --> 00:23:40,921
aspects, Galeed, became the embodiment of God's
divine wrath. It wasn't long before Galeed

261
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:47,605
became corrupted by power, as his wrath was
not tempered by vengeance or a sense of justice.

262
00:23:48,106 --> 00:23:53,489
The presence chose a new embodiment for his
wrath, a former fallen angel who sought redemption

263
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:58,716
The Spectre, who you can learn more about in
our Spectre vs Galactus episode. The Spectre

264
00:23:58,776 --> 00:24:04,059
split Galeed in two, imprisoning one portion
in the deepest crater on the dark side of the

265
00:24:04,099 --> 00:24:10,083
moon and the other within a massive black diamond
known as the Heart of Darkness that had been

266
00:24:10,163 --> 00:24:16,186
mined from the planet Apocalypse. The Heart
of Darkness attracted evil and so was hidden

267
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:21,966
for most of human civilization, though it was
eventually discovered in the late 1890s. by

268
00:24:22,006 --> 00:24:28,370
an explorer named Henry Gordon, within an ancient
temple deep in the African jungle. The diamond

269
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:34,274
corrupted Henry, who killed his companion, a
university professor, once they found it. Henry

270
00:24:34,314 --> 00:24:40,598
took the diamond to a jeweler, and tasked him
with dividing the diamond into 1,000 identical

271
00:24:40,658 --> 00:24:46,462
gemstones within one year's time. When Henry
returned for the diamonds, he had the jeweler

272
00:24:46,542 --> 00:24:52,314
killed by two thugs, who stole all but one of
the diamonds from Henry. and sold over 100

273
00:24:52,674 --> 00:24:57,656
of the gemstones before Henry found them a week
later and killed them. The splitting of the

274
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:03,899
diamond weakened the prison-like nature of it,
which allowed the spirit of Galeed, now referring

275
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:09,601
to itself as Eclipso, to influence anyone in
possession of one of the black diamonds if

276
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:15,323
they were angry, or to possess them outright
if they were violent in nature, though Eclipso

277
00:25:15,343 --> 00:25:22,871
could easily be banished from his host when
exposed to sunlight. One of the gemstones eventually

278
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:28,015
found its way back to the African jungle and
came into the possession of a tribal sorcerer

279
00:25:28,396 --> 00:25:34,200
named Mophir. When a solar energy scientist
named Bruce Gordon traveled to the jungle to

280
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,846
view the solar eclipse, a possessed Mophir attacked
Bruce, scratching him with his diamond before

281
00:25:40,886 --> 00:25:46,711
falling off of a cliff. Bruce took the diamond
back with him to America, where, anytime there

282
00:25:46,731 --> 00:25:53,512
was an eclipse, he became possessed by Eclipso.
now a frequent foe of the DC superhero community.

283
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:59,336
Unaware of the nature of the Diamond, Bruce
simply believed that Eclipso was an alternate,

284
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:04,539
superpowered evil persona of his, though when
he learned the nature of the Diamond, he was

285
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:09,863
able to prevent himself from becoming the villain
through solar-powered technology. It was later

286
00:26:09,923 --> 00:26:15,838
revealed that Henry Gordon was Bruce Gordon's
time-traveling son. who traveled to the past

287
00:26:15,918 --> 00:26:20,682
intending to destroy the Heart of Darkness and
prevent his father from being used by Eclipso,

288
00:26:21,082 --> 00:26:27,927
but was corrupted by the Diamond instead. Eventually,
the time traveling hero known as Mon-El discovered

289
00:26:28,007 --> 00:26:33,110
a fortress that Eclipso had erected on the dark
side of the moon and became possessed by the

290
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:38,554
other half of the spirit while investigating.
This allowed Eclipso to merge both halves of

291
00:26:38,594 --> 00:26:44,970
his spirit and managed to possess all of Earth's
heroes whom he brought to the moon. Bruce Gordon

292
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:50,875
was able to free everyone, however, alongside
a team of scientists who wielded solar weaponry

293
00:26:50,915 --> 00:26:56,440
that Bruce had designed. In an epic battle against
Eclipso on the moon, the villain was seemingly

294
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:03,427
destroyed by a solar bomb. But because the Heart
of Darkness still existed, so too did Eclipso's

295
00:27:03,507 --> 00:27:09,232
spirit. He next appeared in the fictional South
American nation of Peridot, where he possessed

296
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:16,023
a drug and eventually possessed the country's
president, allowing him to take control over

297
00:27:16,043 --> 00:27:22,586
the entire nation and its army. Seeking vengeance
against Bruce Gordon, Eclipso attacked Bruce's

298
00:27:22,626 --> 00:27:28,588
fiance's father, resulting in Bruce gathering
several allies, including his fiance Mona,

299
00:27:29,069 --> 00:27:34,431
a fellow scientist named Cave Carson, and the
Creeper, who you can learn more about in our

300
00:27:34,491 --> 00:27:39,853
Creeper vs. Nightcrawler episode. Bruce and
the others ventured into Peridot, only to be

301
00:27:39,913 --> 00:27:47,154
captured by Eclipso, and force-fed black diamonds
before being set free. The ordeal stirred Amanda

302
00:27:47,174 --> 00:27:52,359
Waller and other heroes to action, though U.S.
forces suffered major casualties as a result

303
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:58,444
of warring with Peridot's forces. Amanda Waller,
Bruce Gordon, and others were put on trial

304
00:27:58,484 --> 00:28:04,088
by the UN for attempting to overthrow a sovereign
nation, and Eclipso threatened to nuke the

305
00:28:04,148 --> 00:28:10,193
planet if they weren't found guilty. As heroes
around the world prepared to take on Eclipso,

306
00:28:10,754 --> 00:28:15,719
The Phantom Stranger and the Spectre united
to fight the villain, managing to gather all

307
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:21,885
of the black diamonds around the world and reforming
the full Heart of Darkness, imprisoning Eclipso

308
00:28:22,105 --> 00:28:28,006
once again. At one point, when the Spectre lost
faith in God, Eclipso managed to break free

309
00:28:28,026 --> 00:28:33,009
of the diamond and possess the specter. The
specter was eventually able to overcome and

310
00:28:33,089 --> 00:28:39,332
retrap Eclipso in the Heart of Darkness before
he crushed the diamond to dust. The fragments

311
00:28:39,372 --> 00:28:44,994
of the Heart of Darkness were eventually gathered
by a man named Alex Montez, however, who was

312
00:28:45,054 --> 00:28:51,777
enraged over the death of his cousin caused
by Eclipso. Save for a single shard, Alex liquefied

313
00:28:51,817 --> 00:28:59,882
the diamond and injected it into himself. body
and occult glyphs and symbology, Eclipso was

314
00:28:59,962 --> 00:29:05,906
trapped within Alex, who took up his moniker
and power as a new version of the villain.

315
00:29:06,306 --> 00:29:12,150
Though Alex later became an anti-hero and ally
of the Justice Society and Black Adam, he was

316
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:18,274
eventually injured with part of his tattoo skin
Damage, which broke the glyphs and freed Eclipso,

317
00:29:18,394 --> 00:29:21,236
who killed Alex's girlfriend, which caused Alex
to

318
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:32,362
Superboy Prime, who teamed with Alexander Luther
Jr. of Earth-3 to restore the multiverse in

319
00:29:32,382 --> 00:29:37,985
the Infinite Crisis event. Superboy Prime gave
the gemstone to Jean Loring, the ex-wife of

320
00:29:38,045 --> 00:29:44,548
Ray Palmer, the Atom. Jean, as Eclipso, manipulated
the specter into destroying magic, which he

321
00:29:44,588 --> 00:29:50,271
nearly successfully did. As the sorcerers and
magicians of Earth fought back, one of them,

322
00:29:50,611 --> 00:29:52,512
an anti-hero known as Nightshade,

323
00:29:56,334 --> 00:30:01,171
where Eclipsa would be trapped and tormented
by the light. Due to his connection to Bruce

324
00:30:01,192 --> 00:30:06,264
Gordon Eclipso eventually made his way back
to Earth and took possession of Bruce once

325
00:30:06,324 --> 00:30:11,906
again, though Bruce found he was able to control
Eclipso as long as he controlled his temper.

326
00:30:12,306 --> 00:30:18,289
When Eclipso managed to kill Bruce's wife, Mona,
he was able to take full control of Bruce's

327
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:24,032
body and wage another campaign against Earth's
heroes, revealing to the angelic hero Zahriyel,

328
00:30:24,312 --> 00:30:29,735
whom he defeated, that his ultimate goal was
to kill God. You can learn more about Zahriyel

329
00:30:29,855 --> 00:30:34,938
in our Zahriyel vs. Archangel episode. After
killing the specter and absorbing all of his

330
00:30:34,978 --> 00:30:41,162
power, Eclipso destroyed the moon, just before
attempting to destroy the Earth and its inhabitants'

331
00:30:41,242 --> 00:30:47,046
love for God. With the combined might of all
of Earth's heroes, however, Eclipso was defeated.

332
00:30:47,506 --> 00:30:54,290
In post-Flashpoint continuity, Eclipso long
ago possessed Lord Kala, a scion of House Onyx

333
00:30:54,391 --> 00:31:03,657
and House Diamond in the fantasy dimension of
Neela, aka Gemworld. of Niela, but was defeated

334
00:31:03,697 --> 00:31:09,641
by Lady Shandra of House Amethyst, who trapped
him in a gem called the Black Diamond, which

335
00:31:09,681 --> 00:31:16,105
was banished to Earth's realm. Powers-wise,
Eclipso possesses a vast amount of dark, magical

336
00:31:16,205 --> 00:31:23,790
energy that grants him vast strength and vulnerability,
immortality, telekinesis, and telepathy. He

337
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:28,213
can emit this energy, often by focusing his
gaze through a fragment of the Heart of

338
00:31:31,776 --> 00:31:38,637
darkness and from his light right eye paralyzing
bursts of black light. He can alter his size

339
00:31:38,957 --> 00:31:44,258
and can also manipulate the environment around
him to create thunderstorms, floods, and other

340
00:31:44,298 --> 00:31:50,199
phenomena often attributed to God's wrath. He
can fly or teleport through shadow and he can

341
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:55,480
influence or possess others, particularly if
they are in contact with a fragment of the

342
00:31:55,521 --> 00:32:01,066
Heart of Darkness. Since part of his spirit
is confined to the Heart of Darkness, Destroying

343
00:32:01,146 --> 00:32:07,387
it can weaken him and he's also vulnerable to
bright light and that's Eclipso. If only Malekith

344
00:32:07,407 --> 00:32:12,489
could summon bright light, which I don't think
he can as a member of the Dark Elves. Yes!

345
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:18,551
But, I don't know if Eclipso can summon iron
so I hope he can't. Oh, one more thing he can

346
00:32:18,591 --> 00:32:24,452
do I forgot to mention is not summon iron, but
he can create constructs of shadow and gemstone

347
00:32:24,792 --> 00:32:29,490
as of recent comics. Oh interesting, that's
pretty cool. That's a cool visual. They need

348
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:34,196
to put Eclipso in a bigger movie or something
than just, you know, Stargirls season two.

349
00:32:34,677 --> 00:32:39,142
Although he was freaky as hell in Stargirls
season two. Like there was some horror movie

350
00:32:39,182 --> 00:32:43,328
type shit. Really? I feel like I gotta check
that show out sometime. It's not bad, we should

351
00:32:43,368 --> 00:32:47,693
have reviewed it, honestly. Well, that's, I
blame you for that one. I'll take the blame.

podcast network rises above the rest. Prepare

discover who will emerge victorious. Visit dynamicpodcast.com
where we settle the debate and settle the score.

359
00:33:42,178 --> 00:33:45,681
Well now that we got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

360
00:33:45,721 --> 00:33:51,245
of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not the speculation,

361
00:33:51,366 --> 00:33:55,629
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could
play out. AJ and IK, what are the rules of

362
00:33:55,669 --> 00:34:00,574
our speculation? Well I should say there are
no rules, other than the characters have no

363
00:34:00,634 --> 00:34:05,218
prior knowledge of the other going into the
fight. All they are aware of starting out is

364
00:34:05,238 --> 00:34:09,834
that the other character is a threat that needs
to be eliminated. For the speculation... The

365
00:34:09,854 --> 00:34:14,898
contestants will begin approximately 50 meters
apart in a nondescript environment that will

366
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:20,262
have no bearing on the match itself, as no environmental
statistics are considered in my simulations.

367
00:34:20,562 --> 00:34:25,907
The contestants must earn victory on their own
merit. Alright then, let's get into it. Eclipso

368
00:34:25,947 --> 00:34:31,711
and Malekith meet on the battlefield. Who goes
first? I think Malekith is going to see Eclipso

369
00:34:32,212 --> 00:34:37,236
and conjure a blade, like a Chris sword type
thing, you know like a, it's a sword with like

370
00:34:37,256 --> 00:34:42,447
a wavy blade. Right, right, yeah. He's gonna
see Eclipso and probably assume that the guy

371
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:48,470
is cursed just like him since they have similar
face marks and Malekith is gonna be like let

372
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:54,072
me fix the other side for you and from his sword
He's gonna shoot out an eldritch flame blast

373
00:34:54,132 --> 00:35:00,235
right at Eclipso's face. Just melting that shit
right off Okay, I mean so as this fireball

374
00:35:00,275 --> 00:35:06,222
is coming at Eclipso He's gonna generate a shield
made of gemstone to block it then he's gonna

375
00:35:06,242 --> 00:35:11,787
hold up a shard of the heart of darkness to
his right eye, flashing this burst of black

376
00:35:11,867 --> 00:35:17,652
light that's gonna paralyze Malekith. All right.
So Malekith is paralyzed. And by the time he

377
00:35:17,772 --> 00:35:23,197
even realizes what's happening, Eclipso has
already moved right over to him and created

378
00:35:23,237 --> 00:35:28,341
his own sword of crystal and shadow that he's
just going to plunge right into Malekith's

379
00:35:28,401 --> 00:35:34,498
chest. No, cause Malekith teleports, you know,
he disappears in this green flash. and Eclipso

380
00:35:34,578 --> 00:35:39,302
doesn't see him anymore. All he hears is Malekith's
laughter just echoing from all directions.

381
00:35:39,663 --> 00:35:43,026
And it's like, it'll start off quietly at first,
but it's gonna get like louder and louder,

382
00:35:43,046 --> 00:35:48,851
just like deafening Eclipso as Malekith suddenly
appears, knocking Eclipso's sword out of his

383
00:35:48,891 --> 00:35:53,655
hand and then catching it and then using both
of the swords, like scissors to lop off Eclipso's

384
00:35:53,675 --> 00:36:01,081
head. Wait, he took Eclipso's sword? Yes. Okay,
well, as Malekith is holding Eclipso's shadow

385
00:36:01,121 --> 00:36:07,541
sword. Before he could decapitate Eclipso, the
shadow blade moves like liquid up Melikith's

386
00:36:07,801 --> 00:36:14,424
arm and across his body before disappearing
into his ears. So now Melikith is possessed

387
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:20,188
by Eclipso with like an eclipse symbol over
his face and Eclipso is going to force Melikith

388
00:36:20,468 --> 00:36:26,551
to cut off his own head. Well I mean if Melikith
sees this like liquid shadow moving up over

389
00:36:26,591 --> 00:36:31,514
his body, that's gonna give him time to come
up with a counter spell pretty quick. And you

390
00:36:31,534 --> 00:36:36,597
know, like as a dark elf, he's familiar with
shadow magic, so he's gonna take control of

391
00:36:36,617 --> 00:36:42,281
this shadow, lift it off of himself, and like
reshape it into the form of like this raven

392
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:47,345
that is gonna fly at Eclipso and snatch the
black diamond that he's carrying away from

393
00:36:47,385 --> 00:36:52,408
him. Okay, well Eclipso, he's gonna quickly
grow to like three stories and just snatch

394
00:36:52,448 --> 00:36:57,852
the bird before it can fly away with his diamond.
And Eclipso's gonna just look down at Melikith

395
00:36:58,172 --> 00:37:03,679
and slam his fist down right on him. Just crushing
his body into the ground. Okay, but you know,

396
00:37:03,919 --> 00:37:09,841
Eclipso's tall and a little bit slow. So as
his fist is coming down, Malekith summons the

397
00:37:09,881 --> 00:37:16,284
Casket of Ancient Winters artifact from out
of thin air. And he uses it to freeze Eclipso's

398
00:37:16,404 --> 00:37:24,387
arm right through. What? Dude, he can't do that.
What? Why not? How is that allowed? Why does

399
00:37:24,427 --> 00:37:28,389
Eclipso get the Heart of Darkness and Malekith
doesn't get the Casket of Ancient Winters,

400
00:37:28,449 --> 00:37:34,212
like in his back pocket? Because Eclipso always
has a shard of the Heart of Darkness. Yeah,

401
00:37:34,292 --> 00:37:38,195
and like the casket of Ancient Winters is small
enough to be portable, you know? It's smaller

402
00:37:38,235 --> 00:37:42,918
than it was in the movies, in the first Thor
movie. Really? Yeah, it's tiny. It's like the

403
00:37:43,038 --> 00:37:48,822
size of a small jewelry box kind of thing. Oh.
Meh. So this works, you know, Eclipso's fist

404
00:37:48,862 --> 00:37:54,366
comes down and his whole arm just shatters right
off with, you know, Malekith protecting himself

405
00:37:54,386 --> 00:38:00,654
with a magic energy shield, smiling and then
hiding the casket again. Dang. So, Calypso's

406
00:38:00,734 --> 00:38:05,755
pissed off right now. So, as he shrinks back
down to his normal height, you know, his eyes

407
00:38:05,815 --> 00:38:12,057
just glowing red, he's gonna conjure this violent
thunderstorm that rains lightning across the

408
00:38:12,097 --> 00:38:18,779
environment and zaps Malekith like numerous
times until he's literally fried. Malekith

409
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:22,240
deals with lightning all the time when he fights
Thor, you know, he's no stranger to a lightning

410
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:27,241
attack. All he's gonna do here is transform
his body into like this mist cloud and that's

411
00:38:27,261 --> 00:38:32,264
gonna sink into the earth below them and therefore
the lightning is just you know gonna strike

412
00:38:32,284 --> 00:38:37,669
the ground no big deal but then all of a sudden
the ground shakes like there's an earthquake

413
00:38:38,189 --> 00:38:42,673
and a group of rock trolls are gonna rise from
the ground and just beat the shit out of a

414
00:38:42,713 --> 00:38:48,298
clip so with their rock clubs oh dang wait so
is the clip so in the rock trolls or he just

415
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:54,423
conjured them malekits still in the ground in
his missed form and he just conjured the rock

416
00:38:54,463 --> 00:39:02,044
trolls okay so eclipse those Storm like vanished
as soon as Melikith did so the Sun is probably

417
00:39:02,084 --> 00:39:09,009
shining right now and right when the rock trolls
emerge Eclipso is gonna telekinetically slam

418
00:39:09,029 --> 00:39:15,514
them all together to form a single like giant
stone ball But he levitates into the sky to

419
00:39:15,554 --> 00:39:22,599
cast a shadow upon the environment an eclipse
that increases his power So wherever Melikith

420
00:39:22,639 --> 00:39:28,950
is right now Eclipso is gonna telekinetically
pull his mist body into his grasp and hold

421
00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:35,512
him and blasting Melikith point blank with this
dark energy blast that's so powerful it's gonna

422
00:39:35,653 --> 00:39:41,614
send Melikith crashing through the rock troll
moon and all the way to the sun where he dies.

423
00:39:42,135 --> 00:39:47,316
That's not even a real eclipse, how does that
count? It's counted before in the comics where

424
00:39:47,336 --> 00:39:53,827
like things could block the sun it's like oh
it's an eclipse! Okay. I'm gonna say that when

425
00:39:53,967 --> 00:39:59,591
Eclipso does summon Malekith into his grasp,
he's holding onto his hunting horn. And as

426
00:39:59,631 --> 00:40:04,374
he blows into it, he's gonna summon the Wild
Hunt, which is this pack of supernatural dogs,

427
00:40:04,754 --> 00:40:11,099
and also a winged white tiger, and they're all
just gonna devour Eclipso whole. And Eclipso's

428
00:40:11,139 --> 00:40:16,342
gonna be like, Oh god, they're killing me! And
Malekith is gonna be laughing and having a

429
00:40:16,362 --> 00:40:25,727
good time. Match over. Okay, so three things.
One, uh... That tiger is super random. Two,

430
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:30,969
Eclipso's not gonna be saying anything if this
happens. And it's not gonna happen because

431
00:40:31,049 --> 00:40:36,312
three, yeah, that wild hunt is gonna follow
Malekith's ass into the sun because he's already

432
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:40,973
there by the time he blows that horn. Well,
one, don't knock the white tiger because it's

433
00:40:41,013 --> 00:40:46,316
bad ass, you know, it has wings and Malekith
rides it and it looks awesome. Two, you're

434
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:52,238
wrong. And three, let's run the stats to see
which of these scenarios happens. Sure. Okay,

435
00:40:52,358 --> 00:40:58,461
so either Bella Kith gets blasted into the sun
or he blows his horn in time to have the wild

436
00:40:58,481 --> 00:41:04,324
hunt devour Eclipso. We'll go ahead and input
the stats, run the simulations, and come back

437
00:41:04,344 --> 00:41:12,188
with a winner. AJ9K, hit it! Inputting data.
Running calculations. Processing results. Simulations

438
00:41:12,208 --> 00:41:18,159
complete. Alright, this is a pretty fun matchup.
It's always really hard. speculate on matches

439
00:41:18,199 --> 00:41:23,463
between wizards and sorcerers and like magical
entities and stuff like that because they can

440
00:41:23,503 --> 00:41:27,567
almost do anything so you have to be really
creative and make sure that all of the spells

441
00:41:27,647 --> 00:41:32,611
are in keeping with the themes of the character
and stuff like that but that being said I think

442
00:41:32,631 --> 00:41:37,074
we did a pretty good job with that speculation
it was a lot of fun yeah both characters are

443
00:41:37,174 --> 00:41:43,740
really powerful Malekith ended up being more
powerful than I anticipated I thought Eclipsa

444
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,554
was gonna totally take this considering You
know, he's pretty much the equivalent of the

445
00:41:47,614 --> 00:41:52,876
specter, but uh, Melikith definitely held his
own. Yeah. Melikith goes, you know, toe to

446
00:41:52,896 --> 00:41:58,077
toe with Thor and obviously Thor can beat the
specter, so there you go. Uh, Galactus couldn't

447
00:41:58,117 --> 00:42:04,019
even beat the specter. Spoiler alert. Spoilers.
Come on, man. Come on. Everybody go listen

448
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:07,920
to the specter versus Galactus Duel episode
now, but not before you get the results here.

449
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:15,802
Stat wise, Eclipso was more durable and stronger
and could seemingly do more damage with less

450
00:42:15,862 --> 00:42:21,405
effort. The dude is really powerful. But Malekith,
we said, has him on fighting skill because

451
00:42:21,445 --> 00:42:25,466
he does a lot of swordplay, especially when
he was wielding like the Necro Sword in the

452
00:42:25,506 --> 00:42:31,709
comics. He was able to successfully best Thor
in sword combat by chopping his arm off. And

453
00:42:31,749 --> 00:42:35,771
Eclipso hasn't really been shown to do that
kind of stuff too much. Well, he actually is

454
00:42:35,791 --> 00:42:40,933
shown to do a lot of sword fighting, but he
also tends to lose a lot of those sword fights.

455
00:42:41,133 --> 00:42:47,670
Because of Eclipso's strength He seemingly tends
to tank a lot of attacks directed at him, whereas

456
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:53,274
Malekith avoids most attacks that are directed
at him, either by transmuting his form into

457
00:42:53,294 --> 00:42:58,379
a mist or by pulling up a Eldritch shield or
something like that. Teleporting, so we said

458
00:42:58,439 --> 00:43:02,622
Malekith had a slight edge over Eclipso when
it comes to evasiveness. But both these guys

459
00:43:02,642 --> 00:43:07,487
are super versatile. They're pretty smart and
strategic. Yeah, and they're both really fast

460
00:43:07,507 --> 00:43:12,094
and they can both teleport. So all that said,
Jonathan. Who do you think is going to win

461
00:43:12,134 --> 00:43:16,635
this and why do you think it's Malekith? I don't
think it's Malekith. I think it's Eclipso.

462
00:43:17,135 --> 00:43:21,256
I think it's going to be closer than I thought
it was going to be, but I still think Eclipso

463
00:43:21,296 --> 00:43:29,318
is going to take the lead here, as do our Instagram
followers, 68% of whom said that Eclipso was

464
00:43:29,338 --> 00:43:34,080
going to take the win. I don't think it's going
to be a win percentage that high in the simulation

465
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:39,461
results, but I think Eclipso is still going
to get the win. I'm honestly surprised Eclipso

466
00:43:39,521 --> 00:43:44,252
beat Malekith in the poll. considering I tend
to think of these things as popularity contests.

467
00:43:44,813 --> 00:43:49,957
And since Malekith was in Thor the Dark World,
I thought more people would actually vote for

468
00:43:50,017 --> 00:43:54,681
him. But I think it just kind of goes to show
how much people really don't like Thor the

469
00:43:54,721 --> 00:44:02,108
Dark World. Well, let's see if these people
are right. AJ9K, the results please. Hey, Yuasa.

470
00:44:03,189 --> 00:44:15,573
Okay, the winner between Eclipso and Malekith
is... Don't act like you're frozen. It was

471
00:44:15,593 --> 00:44:23,678
Eclipso. Yes. Yeah. Eclipso out of the 1000
matches won 531 battles over Malekith's 469

472
00:44:24,699 --> 00:44:31,103
wins. So it was 53.1% over 46.9%. See, that's
actually closer than I thought it was going

473
00:44:31,143 --> 00:44:37,127
to be, but I'll still take the win because Eclipso
is dope. I think Eclipso is lame. I think Eclipses

474
00:44:37,167 --> 00:44:42,639
in general are lame. You know, it's just a,
just a big shadow. get over it people who cares.

475
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:50,883
I think you're lame Jonathan big time and I
think we should wrap this shit up. Don't be

476
00:44:50,923 --> 00:44:55,646
a sore loser. People wanted Eclipsa to win the
people got what they wanted. We should all

477
00:44:55,666 --> 00:45:01,229
be happy. I am people. Yeah, but you don't you
don't count Marvel fans aren't real people.

478
00:45:01,289 --> 00:45:05,451
Anyway, what are you talking about? Of course,
we're real people. We have real feelings. They

479
00:45:05,491 --> 00:45:13,035
get really hurt when we lose these Duel matches.
Okay. Punch us, we bleed. Okay, don't actually.

480
00:45:13,575 --> 00:45:16,697

episode, as we mentioned earlier, We will be

491
00:46:09,634 --> 00:46:14,576
doing a throwback review of the film Thor the
Dark World. I think it will be interesting

492
00:46:14,596 --> 00:46:19,638
to revisit this film after a lot of terrible
Marvel projects like the Marvels have come

493
00:46:19,718 --> 00:46:25,440
out. Watch your language. OK, words mean things.
You can't just call the Marvels terrible when

494
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:31,082
it was in fact not terrible and, you know, adequate.
That's how you could describe the Marvels.

495
00:46:31,102 --> 00:46:36,385
OK, if you want to talk about terrible, look
at a movie like Catwoman. OK, that's a proper

496
00:46:36,445 --> 00:46:40,811
word for that movie. All right. But that does
it for this episode guys, we want to give a

497
00:46:40,871 --> 00:46:46,034

501
00:47:02,705 --> 00:47:06,727
I was falling in love, now I'm only falling
apart. There's nothing I can do. A total eclipse

502
00:47:06,747 --> 00:47:07,268
of the fart.
