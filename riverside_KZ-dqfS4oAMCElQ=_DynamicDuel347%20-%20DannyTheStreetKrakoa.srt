00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,652
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:29,912 --> 00:00:35,114
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based

4
00:00:35,154 --> 00:00:41,116
battle simulations. I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his
twin brother Marvelous Joe. And in this episode,

5
00:00:41,156 --> 00:00:48,019
we are doing a duel between the two landmass
characters, Danny the Street from the Doom

6
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:55,067
Patrol comics and Kercoa, a mutant from Marvel's
X-Men comics. This matchup has been an idea

7
00:00:55,127 --> 00:00:59,751
that our executive producers came up with a
while back. I never actually thought you would

8
00:00:59,831 --> 00:01:04,815
ever do it because the speculation is going
to be weird for this one. Like I still have

9
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:09,819
no idea how it's going to go down. We're going
into uncharted territory here, folks. Somebody

10
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:13,382
give us a Guinness World Record because I think
we're going to be the first people ever to

11
00:01:13,462 --> 00:01:20,548
speculate on how a fight would go between two
locations, not people or things to locations.

12
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:25,872
No idea how that's going to work out. Right,
yeah, wish us luck. Before the matchup, we're

13
00:01:25,892 --> 00:01:30,835
going to break down the comic book movie news
from the past week, of which there was still

14
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:36,539
not really any news thanks to the ongoing writers
and actors strikes. We are going to talk about

15
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,983
Ed Boon, the creator of Mortal Kombat, talking
about a potential Marvel vs. DC fighting game,

16
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:47,027
and that's about it. As always, we list our
segment times in our episode description, so

17
00:01:47,087 --> 00:01:51,754
feel free to check out the show notes if you
want to skip ahead to a particular topic. As

18
00:01:51,814 --> 00:01:56,037
our listeners already know, our dual simulator
has become so advanced it's gained sentience,

19
00:01:56,457 --> 00:02:00,420
and has named itself the artificial life form
for running extensive duels, just a rather

20
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:06,464
very intelligent simulator 9000, or Alfred Jarvis
9000. Here's a quick message for our listeners,

to the no prize! A no prize is an award Marvel

44
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:16,923
used to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic
Dual No Prize, is a digital award that we post

45
00:04:16,943 --> 00:04:21,584
on Instagram and in our email newsletter for
the person that we feel gave the best answer

46
00:04:21,824 --> 00:04:27,358
to our question of the week. Last week's question
was... Who's your favorite robot character

47
00:04:27,398 --> 00:04:32,619
from Marvel and DC and why? And that was coming
off of the announcement of my and Jonathan's

48
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:37,181
card game that we invented called Chronicle
AI, which is about artificial intelligence

49
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:42,162
robots. We got three answers total, so let's
run down our two honorable mentions and the

50
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:48,524
no prize winner. Our first honorable mention
goes to Christopher Menotti, who said, Hi guys,

51
00:04:48,564 --> 00:04:56,186
Christopher Menotti. My favorite Marvel DC robot
character is Red Tornado. Red Tornado is a

52
00:04:56,226 --> 00:05:04,628
great character that is not used enough. I think
his powers are very unique for a robot. Robots

53
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:09,790
tend to have a lot of the same powers. Plus,
it's a lot of fun watching his character grow,

54
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:15,772
especially in Young Justice, when he creates
an alternate body to experience humanity. I

55
00:05:15,812 --> 00:05:21,573
think that's really interesting. Yeah, Red Tornado
is very unique when it comes to other robots.

56
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:27,433
Not many of them are elemental forces of nature
like the Red Tornado, right? And the character

57
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:33,297
was very well done in Young Justice, which was
a callback to his mentorship role in the comic

58
00:05:33,377 --> 00:05:38,060
of the same title. Yeah, Red Tornado has always
been this interesting mix of like technology

59
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:42,503
and nature, you know? So there's always been
that dichotomy within the character that I

60
00:05:42,523 --> 00:05:45,726
thought has been pretty interesting. If you
want to learn more about Red Tornado, check

61
00:05:45,766 --> 00:05:51,029
out his dual episode against Sandman. It was
basically wind versus earth powers. It was

62
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:56,723
pretty cool. Yeah, our next honorable mention
goes to Mitchell Smoothie, who said, Hello,

63
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:06,065
Mitchell Smoothie here. And I would say my favorite
robot is probably from Marvel, and it's the

64
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:14,048
sinister Adaptoid. Due to his abilities to copy
all the sinister six, he's just the best robot,

65
00:06:14,228 --> 00:06:19,889
taking the best parts of Super Adaptoid and
putting them into his own spin. That's why

66
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:26,033
he's just the best robot. and he is a robot.
I checked it out. Thank you. Have a great day.

67
00:06:26,073 --> 00:06:30,917
Yeah, the sinister adaptoid is an adaptoid with
the powers of the sinister six. I would argue

68
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:36,562
that super adaptoid is actually better. The
super adaptoid gave birth to the adaptoid after

69
00:06:36,762 --> 00:06:42,027
acquiring the power of the cosmic cube. And
the super adaptoid itself was created from

70
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:48,192
AIM, Advanced Idea Mechanics using a portion
of their cosmic cube. Basically the robot can

71
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:52,843
adopt any sort of power that it wants to. We're
hoping to get a dual episode with Super Adaptoid

72
00:06:52,963 --> 00:06:57,725
against Amazo at some point, because Amazo is
a robot with pretty much the same power too.

73
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:04,348
That'll be a good one. Yeah, I remember Super
Adaptoid from the Modok show and he was hilarious.

74
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:09,630
That's my only experience with him. But yeah,
I think he's a fantastic robot. Thanks Christopher

75
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,632
and Mitchell for taking the time to visit our
website and record an answer. But the winner

76
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:19,783
of this week's no prize is Travis Herndon, who
said, Hey guys, Travis here. So my pick would

77
00:07:19,823 --> 00:07:25,267
have to be Baymax. I know he's not completely
accurate, but he's still an iconic robot character

78
00:07:25,327 --> 00:07:30,671
after just one movie. From his design, from
his voice, you can't hate Baymax. And if you

79
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:35,154
do, well, you deserve to get throw-a-chopped.
Not punch, but chopped for that comment. Yeah,

80
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:40,538
I mean, if you don't like Baymax, who the hell
do you think you are, right? Baymax is one

81
00:07:40,578 --> 00:07:45,961
of the most original, unique robot character
designs in the history of robots, honestly.

82
00:07:46,454 --> 00:07:52,101
The way Pixar adapted him from the comic books
where he was more of a techno shapeshifter

83
00:07:52,382 --> 00:07:58,290
to the film Big Hero 6 where he is like a cuddly
balloon healthcare robot I thought was pretty

84
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:06,118
ingenious. I mean, I don't like Baymax. Well
you're a piece of shit then. Guess what? Prepare

85
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:11,262
to get throat chopped. I'm just kidding. I like
Baymax. I love the design, like you mentioned,

86
00:08:11,302 --> 00:08:16,886
of the character from the movie. Have they incorporated
that version into the comics? No. No, they

87
00:08:16,906 --> 00:08:20,850
haven't. He's still like a metallic robot. Although,
you know, they don't appear too much. Well,

88
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:26,674
apparently Marvel Comics doesn't care for Baymax
either. They've kind of relinquished the characters

89
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:31,138
to Disney publishing, because Disney kind of
took the characters in a direction that seems

90
00:08:31,158 --> 00:08:37,902
a little bit more iconic and lasting. Interesting.
So congrats to Travis for winning this week's

91
00:08:37,942 --> 00:08:41,649
No Prize. If you the listener want a shot at
winning your own No Prize, stay tuned to later

92
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:45,938
on this episode when we'll be asking another
question of the week. And now that that's done,

93
00:08:46,579 --> 00:08:47,380
on to the news.

94
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:58,428
All right, this past week, ComicBook.com did
an interview with Ed Boone, who is the creative

95
00:08:58,448 --> 00:09:03,791
director behind NetherRealm Studios, which is
a video game production company behind the

96
00:09:03,851 --> 00:09:09,354
Mortal Kombat franchise. And they've also done
video games like Mortal Kombat versus DC and

97
00:09:09,414 --> 00:09:14,597
the Injustice fighting video games. Ed has been
talking for a while about how one of his dream

98
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:19,640
projects would be a Marvel versus DC fighting
video game. And that's pretty cool because

99
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:26,291
it is also a dream project for us. Marvel versus
DC fans. You know, that's the end all be all,

100
00:09:26,391 --> 00:09:32,595
I think, is a fighting video game between these
comic book characters. And when Ed Boon talks

101
00:09:32,615 --> 00:09:38,358
about it, it feels more and more like it's within
the realm of reality, you know? Hopefully we

102
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:43,061
see this before we get too old, you and I, Jonathan.
But it was interesting because like a while

103
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:49,184
back, he posted a poll on Twitter asking fans
what they hoped his next project would be.

104
00:09:49,684 --> 00:09:55,064
And one of the options on that poll, was a Marvel
versus DC game, and it overwhelmingly won his

105
00:09:55,104 --> 00:10:00,968
Twitter poll, and nothing has been heard since,
other than Ed Boon basically stating that it

106
00:10:01,048 --> 00:10:06,612
would be difficult to bring this into fruition.
I mean, I kind of feel like if DC and Marvel

107
00:10:06,712 --> 00:10:11,195
don't agree to do this, they're just leaving
the money on the table, right? Absolutely,

108
00:10:11,455 --> 00:10:16,579
yeah. I think with both film franchises struggling
as well, this would be a great way to test

109
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:24,141
the waters to see how eager audiences are for
a Marvel and DC crossover. Yeah, it might be

110
00:10:24,161 --> 00:10:29,065
a good transition from like a cinematic universe
to a video game universe in which they release

111
00:10:29,085 --> 00:10:32,928
a bunch of, you know, different spin-offs and
stuff like that. I think that would be a hell

112
00:10:32,948 --> 00:10:37,632
of a good time. I'm gonna go ahead and read
a quote from comicbook.com's interview with

113
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:43,376
Ed Boon regarding this project in which he said,
I mean, we did a number of games with DC characters

114
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:47,720
with your kids and you're like, who would win
in a fight? Mighty Mouse or Superman? Just

115
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:52,531
these dumb different universe things. There's
part of us that still has those immature conversations.

116
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:57,334
To me, Spider-Man and Batman would be the coolest
thing in the world. So of course we'd love

117
00:10:57,374 --> 00:11:02,196
to do that, but it's probably very difficult
to jump that hurdle. To which I say, Jonathan

118
00:11:02,216 --> 00:11:08,660
and I have made it a weekly thing to have those
immature conversations. It's so much fun to

119
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,983
speculate on how battles between these characters
will go. And even more exciting, I think, would

120
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:19,185
be to actually play it out using a controller.
Oh yeah, absolutely. We've mentioned this before.

121
00:11:19,542 --> 00:11:23,024
maybe once or twice on this podcast. That's
the whole reason we even have this podcast

122
00:11:23,444 --> 00:11:28,708
is because we've been dreaming about a Marvel
versus DC video game since we were teenagers.

123
00:11:29,008 --> 00:11:33,371
Legit, no lie, sometimes I like go to bed at
night just dreaming up different ways that

124
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:38,755
a Marvel versus DC video game could go. Usually
in my dreams, it ends up something like Super

125
00:11:38,795 --> 00:11:44,579
Smash Brothers or the recent DC multiverses
game. But I would settle for literally any

126
00:11:44,819 --> 00:11:49,546
version of this game. For real, I would take
anything like Even like a Tetris version of

127
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:54,349
it, I would take like a Pokemon like back and
forth, choose your move, kind of RPG style.

128
00:11:54,930 --> 00:12:00,173
Anything! Anything Marvel vs. DC. Yeah, of course
DC characters are in a fighting game called

129
00:12:00,213 --> 00:12:05,916
Injustice, which uses the same combat engine
as Mortal Kombat. And the Marvel characters

130
00:12:06,036 --> 00:12:11,519
are commonly featured in the Marvel vs. Capcom
video games, which uses a Street Fighter type

131
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:16,518
fighting engine. So there's a lot of different
ways that this game could go, but... That brings

132
00:12:16,578 --> 00:12:17,691
us to our question of the week.

133
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:28,594
Pitch us your perfect Marvel vs. DC video game.
What would it be like? Yeah, record your answer

139
00:12:58,382 --> 00:13:01,926
So that does it for all of the news for this
episode, now let's move on to the main event,

140
00:13:02,287 --> 00:13:07,574
where we find out who would win in a fight between
the Doom Patrol member, Danny the Street, and

141
00:13:07,594 --> 00:13:09,537
the X-Men member, Krakoa.

142
00:13:24,618 --> 00:13:29,900
Okay, Danny the Street versus Kracoa. As we
mentioned, this is a lead up to episode 350

143
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:35,644
in a few weeks. That's going to pit the teams
of the Doom Patrol against the Guardians of

144
00:13:35,664 --> 00:13:40,667
the Galaxy. When we and the executive producers
were trying to think of the rosters for that

145
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:47,150
team matchup, we figured that Mento was a good
member to put on the Doom Patrol team. Although

146
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:51,673
I don't think any of us loved that Mento is
not a really well known member and he's kind

147
00:13:51,713 --> 00:13:57,369
of an asshole douchebag. He's just not a very
good character, but everyone loves Danny the

148
00:13:57,409 --> 00:14:02,973
Street. You know, he's very popular on the Doom
Patrol television series. And so when we were

149
00:14:03,013 --> 00:14:09,078
thinking of the idea of maybe we replace Mento
with Danny the Street, I have to admit, I got

150
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:13,021
a little frightened because I knew that more
people were going to like Danny the Street

151
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:17,825
than Mento. And sure enough, we voted to include
him on the roster, which brings us to this

152
00:14:17,905 --> 00:14:21,814
episode. Yeah, of course, there's not a whole
lot of people that Danny of the Street can

153
00:14:21,854 --> 00:14:27,096
go up against on Marvel. The most prominent,
like, physical location other than Ego, the

154
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:31,157
living planet, which we've already done a dual
episode with him. But the other best example,

155
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:38,320
I think, is Krakoa, the sentient mutant island
that is the current home of the X-Men and all

156
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,061
mutants on Marvel's Earth. Yeah, the closest
thing we've done to two locations fighting

157
00:14:43,101 --> 00:14:48,459
each other is... ego, the living planet against
Mogo, the Green Lantern, which was like a month

158
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:52,600
ago. Yeah, but that was like relatively easy
because the two planets are still, you know,

159
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,821
like separate entities, you know, they exist
within their own space and everything, but

160
00:14:56,901 --> 00:15:03,903
to like locations like a street and an island,
how do you get them to fight against each other?

161
00:15:03,923 --> 00:15:08,364
We're going to figure it out. But to explain
the methodology behind our duels, let's go

162
00:15:08,404 --> 00:15:15,119
to our sentient dual simulator, Alfred Jarvis,
9000 AJ 9K. Tell our listeners how you go about

163
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:17,400
determining a winner in our dual matchups.

164
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:47,273
from which the DC characters' statistics are
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are

165
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:53,519
included, such as range, damage potential, versatility
and perception, in order to create a more detailed

166
00:15:53,539 --> 00:15:58,663
and accurate simulation. The results of the
1000 simulations provide a percentage of wins

167
00:15:58,703 --> 00:16:03,147
for each character. The contestant with the
higher percentage is declared the victor, as

168
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:08,512
they have a higher probability to win any given
battle. In an equitable pairing, neither character

169
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:13,231
should win 100% of the matches. The comic book
stories have shown that there's even a way

170
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:18,293
for Batman to defeat Superman, so the confidence
rate of my method falls in line with the precedents

171
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:23,375
that have been established in the source material.
My mathematical simulations are without subjectivity

172
00:16:23,435 --> 00:16:28,777
or bias. Feats are not the sole consideration,
nor are fan votes tabulated for determination

173
00:16:28,797 --> 00:16:35,320
of the winner. Thanks AJ9K! Before we run the
simulations though, we like to break down each

174
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:40,906
character's histories and abilities before improvising
a scenario. on how we imagine one of the 1000

175
00:16:41,226 --> 00:16:46,088
simulations would play out beat for beat. Yeah,
and I believe it's my turn to go first, this

176
00:16:46,128 --> 00:16:52,189
time with the Marvel character, so let me go
ahead and tell you all about Krakoa. Two billion

177
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:57,871
years ago, the very first mutants outside of
the normal cycle of evolution thrived on Earth.

178
00:16:58,271 --> 00:17:03,633
One of these mutants was named Grov, a being
who, along with their fellow mutants, formed

179
00:17:03,673 --> 00:17:09,200
a group called the Threshold. The Threshold
was attacked by a group of undersea mutants

180
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:15,063
called the Unbreathing, and Grove sustained
heavy injuries in battle. Grove's mutation,

181
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:20,486
which allowed them to heal through vegetative
growth, transformed them from a wood-elf-looking

182
00:17:20,546 --> 00:17:26,770
being into a bark-covered creature much like
the species Flora colossi, of which the hero

183
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:33,258
Groot is a member. No longer resembling themselves,
Grove changed their name to Okara. And though

184
00:17:33,298 --> 00:17:39,019
both the threshold and unbreathing mutants would
eventually perish, Grove, now Okara, lived

185
00:17:39,199 --> 00:17:44,821
on, changing and growing through the millennia
until they reached the size of an island, free-floating

186
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:51,042
in the South Pacific. Several thousand years
ago, Okara became an island home to a new generation

187
00:17:51,082 --> 00:17:56,004
of mutants led by Apocalypse, whom you can learn
more about in our Black Atom vs Apocalypse

188
00:17:56,084 --> 00:18:05,272
duel. These mutants were attacked by an other-dimensional
demon horde. to cleave Okara in half. Grove,

189
00:18:05,412 --> 00:18:13,118
which had become Okara, now became two separate
beings, Oroko and Krokoa. Apocalypse sealed

190
00:18:13,198 --> 00:18:18,403
the dimensional breach, trapping the demon horde
in their native realm, but sacrificing his

191
00:18:18,463 --> 00:18:25,329
fellow mutants alongside Oroko, half their home.
This left Krokoa alone, once again existing

192
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:30,593
as a free-floating island, now just a part of
its former whole and without much of its former

193
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:36,800
sentience. Years later, during World War II,
Krakoa played a small role in the Pacific Theater

194
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:42,163
when Nick Fury and his Howling Commandos stumbled
upon the island and discovered it was sentient.

195
00:18:42,484 --> 00:18:47,606
Fury and Krakoa reached an agreement that allowed
the commandos to leave the island as long as

196
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:52,289
they kept its existence a secret. You can learn
more about Nick Fury in his duel episode against

197
00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:58,573
Rick Flag. Eventually, Professor X telepathically
discovered Krakoa via his power amplifying

198
00:18:58,613 --> 00:19:03,979
device called Cerebro. He sent his X-Men to
investigate, but the island captured them.

199
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:09,880
Professor X then sent additional mutant recruits
to rescue the X-Men. Krakoa formed itself into

200
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:16,482
a giant humanoid shape and attacked the mutants,
but Polaris, a mutant with powers of magnetism

201
00:19:16,502 --> 00:19:21,424
like her father Magneto, used her abilities
that were supercharged by Storm's lightning

202
00:19:21,764 --> 00:19:27,165
to interact with the Earth's magnetic field,
and she launched Krakoa's landmass into space.

203
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:34,047
While in orbit, Krakoa was captured by the enigmatic
cosmic entity known as the Stranger. The Stranger

204
00:19:34,107 --> 00:19:38,969
took the island to its lap for study, however
some spores of Krakoa had broken off prior

205
00:19:39,349 --> 00:19:45,170
and landed on Earth. One spore became a danger
room-like training ground called the Danger

206
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:51,712
Grotto, which was used by the Generation X mutant
team. Another spore swallowed up 56 construction

207
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:57,066
workers before it was stopped by the new mutants.
And another spore... landed in the British

208
00:19:57,226 --> 00:20:03,347
Isles where the mutant team Excalibur defeated
it. Eventually, a member of the Eternals race

209
00:20:03,448 --> 00:20:09,169
managed to free Kakoa from the Stranger's Lab
in space and it returned to Earth. Professor

210
00:20:09,389 --> 00:20:15,591
X began working to reawaken the island's consciousness
and reshape Kakoa into a paradise for mutants

211
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:21,433
as it had once been thousands of years prior.
He bioengineered new flowers on the island

212
00:20:21,473 --> 00:20:28,797
that produced chemicals that solved many of
regarding antibiotics, longevity, and mental

213
00:20:28,877 --> 00:20:34,702
illnesses. Professor X offered these drugs to
any country that recognized Krakoa as a sovereign

214
00:20:34,762 --> 00:20:41,007
mutant nation, transforming the island into
a pharmaceutical titan and world power overnight.

215
00:20:41,027 --> 00:20:46,432
He also created flowers that could bloom into
self-sustaining biomes anywhere in the universe,

216
00:20:46,772 --> 00:20:52,277
which also served as gateways to and from the
main island. After a period of prosperity on

217
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:57,763
Krakoa, where Professor X and Magneto seemingly
achieved a compromise regarding human and mutant

218
00:20:57,783 --> 00:21:04,266
relations, Krakoa's other half, Arako, returned
from the other dimension where it and its mutant

219
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:10,089
residents had been trapped. Angry at Apocalypse
for his actions several millennia ago, both

220
00:21:10,209 --> 00:21:14,710
islands chose a series of champions to represent
them in a fighting tournament instead of an

221
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:20,773
all out war. Ultimately, Krakoa's champions
won the contest and Apocalypse was sent to

222
00:21:22,434 --> 00:21:27,297
while Arako was brought to Earth. Though the
two island halves had finally gotten their

223
00:21:27,337 --> 00:21:33,341
chance to reunite, they had grown so different
over the millennia that Krakoa and Arako decided

224
00:21:33,401 --> 00:21:39,645
to remain separate and unique. However, a new
island of warlike mutants didn't seem feasible

225
00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:44,288
on Earth when the mutants of Krakoa had just
achieved a semblance of peace with humans.

226
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:50,293
Therefore, Magneto developed a plan to relocate
Arako to Mars, where he would terraform the

227
00:21:51,842 --> 00:21:57,627
to accommodate that island and its mutants.
Mars was then claimed as the first mutant world,

228
00:21:57,728 --> 00:22:02,893
with Arako serving as the new capital of the
solar system. Back on Krakoa, which achieved

229
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:08,819
a total population of approximately 250,000,
mutantkind celebrated their new achievements

230
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:13,584
with an annual celebration event called the
Hellfire Gala. And that's as far as I'll get

231
00:22:13,744 --> 00:22:20,295
with Krakoa's backstory. Powers-wise, Krakoa
is a sentient hive-mined landmass incorporating

232
00:22:20,455 --> 00:22:25,818
all vegetable and animal life forms that reside
on it outside of its mutant inhabitants. It

233
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:31,320
has full control of its mass and can terraform
in any manner it chooses, including creating

234
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:37,042
natural formations such as forests, volcanoes,
and lakes, and unnatural formations such as

235
00:22:37,102 --> 00:22:42,905
massive tentacles, or a giant humanoid rock
plant monster, or even small life forms that

236
00:22:42,965 --> 00:22:48,190
serve as an extension of itself. Krakoa can
drain the life force out of any being that

237
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:53,472
steps foot on its surface. And its biome can
also survive in any environment, even the cold

238
00:22:53,632 --> 00:22:58,873
oxygenless void of space, and it can create
gateway portals allowing residents to travel

239
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:04,255
between portions of itself. Krakoa has also
demonstrated the ability to create a variety

240
00:23:04,295 --> 00:23:09,756
of chemicals via manipulation of its own natural
chemistry. Though the island is conscious,

241
00:23:09,916 --> 00:23:15,766
it has limited intelligence and operates mostly
out of instinct. That's Krakoa. That was pretty

242
00:23:15,966 --> 00:23:22,529
convoluted. I'm not sure it needed to be that
convoluted. Well, that describes Hickman's

243
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:28,812
run on X-Men to a T, right? I mean, Hickman
threw in this entire mythology that he developed

244
00:23:28,852 --> 00:23:35,054
that stretches from ancient prehistory to outer
space. And it's a lot, you know, it's one of

245
00:23:35,094 --> 00:23:39,796
the most unique things about his run on X-Men
and also one of the worst. It's almost like

246
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:44,303
he brought in all these different elements and
ideas that. don't necessarily fit the mold

247
00:23:44,343 --> 00:23:49,067
of the X-Men, but I still admire Hickman as
a writer nonetheless. Just the whole thing

248
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:55,072
of like, Krokoa being like initially a like
wood elf that became a plant island that was

249
00:23:55,152 --> 00:24:00,537
split in two. Just make it a fucking mutant
that was an island, period. That's all you

250
00:24:00,557 --> 00:24:04,841
need to say. Right, right, right. I think the
biggest bullshit thing is that he decided to

251
00:24:05,341 --> 00:24:11,506
name the original land mass as an anagram for
Krokoa called Okara. And then it split into

252
00:24:11,626 --> 00:24:16,230
Arako and Krakow. It's just he didn't need to
do that. You know, they didn't need to be rearrangements

253
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,934
of the same six letters. You know, right. Right.
How old is Krakow is like Krakow, like one

254
00:24:20,954 --> 00:24:27,359
of Stanley's old, like monsters like Fin Fum
or something like that. Krakow made its first

255
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:31,903
appearance to my recollection in Giant Size
X-Men, where we were introduced to characters

256
00:24:31,943 --> 00:24:36,527
like Storm, Nightcrawler and Colossus. Oh, really?
That's cool. And you know what else is cool?

257
00:24:36,987 --> 00:24:43,232
Danny the Street. Let me get to his back story.
Danny the Street is a sentient, male, genderqueer

258
00:24:43,292 --> 00:24:48,817
pocket dimension that most often presents himself
by appearing as a street full of macho military

259
00:24:48,897 --> 00:24:54,762
surplus stores and sports shops, but decorated
with feminine flourishes such as frilly pink

260
00:24:54,822 --> 00:25:01,708
curtains and awnings. Danny is the last survivor
of a dream dimension of pure imagination known

261
00:25:01,788 --> 00:25:08,133
sometimes as Wonderland, Neverland, or Oz that
caught the sickness of the real world and fell

262
00:25:08,153 --> 00:25:14,958
apart. Since then, for decades and perhaps longer,
Danny has traveled the world, warping space-time

263
00:25:14,978 --> 00:25:20,743
to integrate himself seamlessly into any location
in search of the lonely outcasts of the world.

264
00:25:21,123 --> 00:25:27,429
Whether it's an alley in Hong Kong or a street
in Toronto, Danny attracts those who feel unaccepted

265
00:25:27,769 --> 00:25:33,494
and gives them a place to live and feel welcome,
often entertaining them with drag shows performed

266
00:25:33,554 --> 00:25:39,458
by the Perpetual Cabaret, a drag troupe who
also lives on Danny. Danny's existence was

267
00:25:39,498 --> 00:25:45,559
eventually discovered by The Men From Nowhere,
a group founded by Darren Jones who was obsessed

268
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:51,341
with eliminating from the world any and all
strangeness, peculiarity, or anything that's

269
00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:57,143
not essentially a white picket fan's 1950s sitcom,
which is how he lived his life, going so far

270
00:25:57,183 --> 00:26:01,904
as to have his wife hit a laugh track button
whenever he made a joke in his home. When The

271
00:26:01,964 --> 00:26:07,485
Men From Nowhere arrived on Danny, they began
killing its citizens and breaking Danny's property.

272
00:26:08,054 --> 00:26:13,475
The Doop Patrol arrived and began being attacked
by the men from nowhere as well. After bringing

273
00:26:13,515 --> 00:26:19,637
them down, Danny teleported next to Darren Jones'
home and had the perpetual cabaret dress him

274
00:26:19,677 --> 00:26:25,579
up in drag just before his boss visited for
dinner, which resulted in Darren being fired

275
00:26:25,639 --> 00:26:30,261
and his reputation tarnished after Danny teleported
away. Sounds like the laugh track would be

276
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:35,728
used a lot in that situation though. It was
used in that situation, exactly. It was revealed

277
00:26:35,808 --> 00:26:41,651
one of Danny's residents was an amnesiac hero
named Flex Mantallo, who had regained his memory

278
00:26:41,751 --> 00:26:47,034
after seeing the Doom Patrol come to the rescue
of the citizens. Flex, attempting to rebuild

279
00:26:47,074 --> 00:26:52,337
his life, was captured by the Men From Nowhere
along with the Doom Patrol member Dorothy Spinner

280
00:26:52,658 --> 00:26:58,381
and imprisoned in the sub-sub basement of the
Pentagon. Danny helped the Doom Patrol rescue

281
00:26:58,421 --> 00:27:04,224
Flex and Dorothy, by teleporting himself into
the Pentagon basement, after which Danny became

282
00:27:04,324 --> 00:27:10,407
the Doom Patrol's headquarters. Not long after,
however, Danny was seemingly abducted by Mr.

283
00:27:10,487 --> 00:27:15,609
Nobody and the Brotherhood of Dada, villains
of the Doom Patrol and outcasts in their own

284
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:20,871
right, though it was revealed that the Brotherhood
merely wanted Danny to take them away, which

285
00:27:20,912 --> 00:27:26,514
he was happy to oblige. When an evil entity
known as the Candlemaker emerged from the mind

286
00:27:26,554 --> 00:27:35,500
of Dorothy Spinner, After healing from the ordeal,
Danny eventually grew to form Danny the World,

287
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:40,923
an interdimensional planet and became the home
of several Doom Patrol members such as Crazy

288
00:27:40,963 --> 00:27:46,927
Jane and Negative Man for a time when they left
the team. Danny the World was annihilated by

289
00:27:46,987 --> 00:27:52,991
the Gentrifiers, however, who had attempted
to take him over. Leaving Danny as only a brick,

290
00:27:53,392 --> 00:27:58,675
Crazy Jane fled with him back to the Doom Patrol,
which was based on Oolong Island at the time.

291
00:27:59,396 --> 00:28:05,640
After taking some time to heal, Danny eventually
became Danny the Bungalow. He and Crazy Jane

292
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:11,684
rejoined the Doom Patrol, during which time
he returned to being a Street. In post-Flashpoint

293
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:17,468
continuity, Danny the Street was revealed to
be a teenager, who was discovered by Red Robin

294
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:23,171
of the Teen Titans and recruited to infiltrate
an organization known as Nowhere, which captured

295
00:28:23,251 --> 00:28:25,313
and experimented on young metahumans.

296
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:35,957
Danny became a member of the Teen Titans, acting
as the team's spy. Danny was later nearly destroyed

297
00:28:36,057 --> 00:28:41,498
by Nowhere and used the last of his strength
to teleport the Teen Titans from Mystery Island

298
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:47,619
to New York, seemingly sacrificing himself in
the process and ending up as a mundane ally

299
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:53,120
in the city. It was revealed later, however,
that Danny had actually reverted to the form

300
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:58,734
of a brick, which was found by Crazy Jane and
the two traveled to the cosmos together. After

301
00:28:58,774 --> 00:29:05,519
being used as a weapon by an entity known as
D to kill a god, Danny retreated to Earth and

302
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:10,582
grew to become Dannyland, an amusement park.
With the happiness he was able to bring the

303
00:29:10,622 --> 00:29:16,547
masses, Danny gained enough strength to create
his own sentient life, bringing to life a comic

304
00:29:16,627 --> 00:29:22,451
character from the Danny-published Danny Comics
named Casey, space case Brink, to see what

305
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:27,554
she would be like in the real world. Unaware
of her true nature, Casey was contacted by

306
00:29:27,614 --> 00:29:33,516
Danny and urged to reform the Doom Patrol when
Danny land became threatened by an alien organization

307
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:39,938
known as Vectra, who wanted to use Danny's new
ability to create life in order to create cheap

308
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:45,459
meat for their chain of intergalactic fast food
restaurants. Taking on an additional form as

309
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:50,841
Danny the Ambulance, Danny helped Casey find
the Doom Patrol members to reform the team

310
00:29:51,181 --> 00:29:56,519
and together they defeated Vectra. When the
Dupatrol member Robotman received an upgrade

311
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:02,521
that caused him to become his own planet, Casey
sacrificed herself to stop him, and she returned

312
00:30:02,601 --> 00:30:08,684
to being a comic character in Danny Comics.
And that's Danny's history so far. Powers-wise,

313
00:30:08,984 --> 00:30:14,586
Danny is a sentient pocket dimension capable
of warping space-time to teleport to any location

314
00:30:14,906 --> 00:30:20,188
and integrate his space seamlessly into it.
Danny has a spatial sense that allows him to

315
00:30:20,248 --> 00:30:26,272
move to any location, in any universe, even
some hidden or unknown areas. He's able to

316
00:30:26,312 --> 00:30:31,321
generate buildings, structures, and objects
to fill his space, and the more inhabitants

317
00:30:31,341 --> 00:30:36,978
that exist within him, the stronger he becomes
and the larger he's able to grow. potentially

318
00:30:37,078 --> 00:30:42,979
even to planet size. When these structures and
objects are damaged, however, Danny is weakened

319
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,981
and is unable to maintain his size. Recently,
Danny has shown to be able to generate sentient

320
00:30:49,021 --> 00:30:54,163
life, though this requires a deal of strength.
He is able to communicate with his inhabitants

321
00:30:54,503 --> 00:31:00,044
by telekinetically transforming the environment
to form words, whether on a window display

322
00:31:00,345 --> 00:31:05,106
or even a puddle on the ground. That's Danny
the Street. I gotta say that's every bit as

323
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:10,751
whimsical and fantastical as I hoped it would
be being familiar with the character on the

324
00:31:10,811 --> 00:31:15,875
Doom Patrol television series. Anytime Danny
of the Street shows up on that show, I'm always

325
00:31:16,055 --> 00:31:21,680
thrilled because it's just such a unique concept,
especially his method of communication. Just

326
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:26,764
the way he expresses himself is quite brilliant
actually. I think it's a truly unique concept.

327
00:31:27,144 --> 00:31:31,648
Yeah, he's really cool. I'm glad we're gonna
include him on the team duel match that's coming

328
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:35,471
up against the Guardians of the Galaxy. I feel
like I have a better idea of how that will

329
00:31:35,511 --> 00:31:41,177
play out where it's an environment versus a
group of superheroes as opposed to how this

330
00:31:41,217 --> 00:31:45,541
will play out where it's an environment versus
another environment. But let's go ahead and

331
00:31:45,561 --> 00:31:46,121
give it a shot.

332
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:57,080
Because now that we got their histories and
abilities out of the way, we're going to speculate

333
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,585
on how one of the 1000 simulated matches will
go. The winner is determined by simulations,

334
00:32:02,725 --> 00:32:07,168
not the speculation, but it's fun to imagine
how the fight could play out. Alfred Jarvis

335
00:32:07,209 --> 00:32:13,073
9000, what are the rules of our speculation?
Well I should say there are no rules, other

336
00:32:13,093 --> 00:32:17,157
than the characters have no prior knowledge
of the other going into the fight. All they

337
00:32:17,177 --> 00:32:21,700
are aware of starting out is that the other
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.

338
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:27,409
For the speculation… The contestants will begin
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript

339
00:32:27,449 --> 00:32:32,253
environment that will have no bearing on the
match itself as no environmental statistics

340
00:32:32,273 --> 00:32:37,818
are considered in my simulations. The contestants
must earn victory on their own merit. And since

341
00:32:37,858 --> 00:32:43,743
both characters are environments, we could go
ahead and disregard what AJ9K said about environments

342
00:32:43,783 --> 00:32:48,887
not being a factor. But let's go ahead and get
into it. Danny the Street and Krakoa meet on

343
00:32:48,907 --> 00:32:55,050
the battlefield and they are the battlefield
as well. But who goes first? OK, so I'm assuming

344
00:32:55,330 --> 00:33:00,232
this match starts off with the environments,
like the street and the island about 50 meters

345
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:07,134
apart from each other, while the space around
them is otherwise void and empty. But I think

346
00:33:07,214 --> 00:33:14,776
Danny is going to start by teleporting himself
onto Krakow. So now this island has a bustling

347
00:33:14,896 --> 00:33:20,377
street in the middle of it. And am I allowed
to have people on Danny the street? Would you

348
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:27,081
say like? the perpetual cabaret maybe. I think
like how usually in our duels the environment

349
00:33:27,121 --> 00:33:32,464
has no bearing on the characters. Here, the
characters are gonna have no bearing on the

350
00:33:32,544 --> 00:33:38,648
environments. So the locations have to win on
their own merits basically. Okay. So no people.

351
00:33:39,208 --> 00:33:46,272
Okay, let's say Danny teleports onto Krakoa
and he's just gonna cause like one of the shelves

352
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:51,815
in his army surplus store to break. So these
boxes of kerosene fuel tanks are just going

353
00:33:51,835 --> 00:33:57,837
to roll out of the store into Krakow, which
is going to cause this huge fire to break out

354
00:33:57,917 --> 00:34:03,239
on the island. And Danny's going to teleport
away from that to prevent any damage to himself.

355
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:09,702
Okay. So Krakow has this fire going on it, but
it's going to terraform and it's going to divert

356
00:34:09,782 --> 00:34:15,564
a river that's flowing through the island over
to the fire to put it out. And then once it's

357
00:34:15,704 --> 00:34:21,359
out, Krakow is going to divert the river again.
to wherever Danny has teleported and the river's

358
00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:25,641
gonna flood Danny the street. And the flash
flood is basically gonna tear everything apart.

359
00:34:25,961 --> 00:34:31,524
I cannot think of her signs and small buildings.
Except one of the signs is gonna read F-U.

360
00:34:31,924 --> 00:34:38,148
It's gonna be like, oh shit. Okay, so Danny's
definitely hurt by this and he's gonna become

361
00:34:38,648 --> 00:34:45,043
Danny the boat. No, no, Danny the pirate ship.
And on this pirate ship are cannons and that's

362
00:34:45,063 --> 00:34:50,086
going to allow Danny to begin firing cannonballs
in all directions that are just going to tear

363
00:34:50,126 --> 00:34:56,489
through Krakow as Danny sails down the river.
Okay, but Danny the pirate ship now has to

364
00:34:56,529 --> 00:35:01,932
navigate through the series of large jagged
rocks that Krakow puts in the river's path.

365
00:35:02,352 --> 00:35:07,675
So the pirate ship is going to be crashing and
breaking apart all over these rocks and then

366
00:35:07,835 --> 00:35:09,376
oh no, it goes over a waterfall.

367
00:35:13,718 --> 00:35:19,642
Okay, I mean, Denny's sustained more damage,
so he's going to shrink again and transform

368
00:35:19,983 --> 00:35:26,827
as he falls into Denny the fighter jet, because
now he's pissed off. Can he turn into a fighter

369
00:35:26,867 --> 00:35:32,171
jet? Yeah, he could turn into a vehicle. Like
he was once Denny the ambulance, right? Though

370
00:35:32,211 --> 00:35:38,796
he probably can't pilot himself, but you know,
that's what autopilot is for. Okay. So he's

371
00:35:38,816 --> 00:35:43,563
gonna be just like tearing through the sky.
with Highway to the Danger Zone playing a full

372
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:49,386
blast, and he's gonna begin firing missiles
at the Krakoa surface. I do have to say, this

373
00:35:49,406 --> 00:35:55,449
is very uncharacteristic for Danny. He's normally
very peaceful. You just made him mad. I mean,

374
00:35:55,489 --> 00:36:00,532
it's no holds barred action, so you gotta do
what you gotta do. Right, so Danny's a fighter

375
00:36:00,572 --> 00:36:08,196
jet, but Krakoa is gonna manifest this large
volcano on its surface, which is gonna erupt

376
00:36:08,216 --> 00:36:14,128
a mass of lava and ash into the air. and that's
going to blind Danny while he's flying and

377
00:36:14,148 --> 00:36:18,732
just burn him with the lava. And that's going
to cause him to crash into the mountainside

378
00:36:19,253 --> 00:36:24,578
and die. Well, actually, you know, Cucurro is
going to see the plane go into the smoke, but

379
00:36:24,598 --> 00:36:31,484
he doesn't see Danny emerge because Danny teleports
away to another part of the island, it's like

380
00:36:31,504 --> 00:36:38,254
a flower meadow as Danny, the flower meadow.
And from here, while he's camouflaged. he's

381
00:36:38,274 --> 00:36:44,657
going to gather strength from the life force
of Kercoa itself to become Danny the super

382
00:36:44,697 --> 00:36:49,540
highway. And this thing is going to stretch
across the entirety of Kercoa. It's going to

383
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:55,403
be full of like massive diesel trucks that are
all running and they're just polluting Kercoa's

384
00:36:55,443 --> 00:37:03,088
environment. Oh no pollution. So earthquake
basically all those streets and vehicles are

385
00:37:03,108 --> 00:37:07,162
going to come crashing down because Kercoa is
going to generate an earthquake. that just

386
00:37:07,382 --> 00:37:14,185
swallows everything up in this massive tremor.
Okay, so Danny's underground. Let's say now

387
00:37:14,225 --> 00:37:21,808
he becomes Danny the mine. Okay, and mines are
full of explosives. So let's say that happens.

388
00:37:22,088 --> 00:37:27,230
The explosives are going to detonate just blowing
up like a huge chunk of the island. And now

389
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:32,652
Danny is going to teleport across the island
as Danny the pit mine, just causing explosions

390
00:37:32,832 --> 00:37:38,270
all over the island and causing it to cave in
on itself. That's pretty good. Shit. Okay.

391
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:44,272
All right, in order to stop the explosions from
happening, Kracoa is gonna have to catch Danny,

392
00:37:44,452 --> 00:37:51,634
as it were, right? So when Danny the Mine teleports
to a new underground location on Kracoa, before

393
00:37:51,654 --> 00:37:56,355
he sets off the explosives, Kracoa is immediately
gonna send him up to the island's surface,

394
00:37:56,935 --> 00:38:04,077
and waiting for Danny there are a group of large
stone golems with like giant stone clubs that

395
00:38:04,137 --> 00:38:09,576
just- proceed to beat the ever loving shit out
of this pit mine, rendering everything to dust.

396
00:38:09,636 --> 00:38:16,580
I don't even know what that looks like. Okay,
I mean, if Danny gets hit by a bunch of stone

397
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:22,824
clubs, he's hurt for sure. So I'm gonna say
he just teleports away, which is gonna cause

398
00:38:22,864 --> 00:38:27,966
the space time that he occupied to fold back
in on itself. And that circle of golems that

399
00:38:27,986 --> 00:38:33,329
were surrounding him hit and destroyed themselves,
all right? Oh, and also I didn't mention this.

400
00:38:33,846 --> 00:38:39,909
but those mines were uranium mines. So chunks
of uranium are all over the island, just poisoning

401
00:38:39,929 --> 00:38:46,732
the shit out of it and just making everything
die essentially. Okay. Well, I mean, in the

402
00:38:46,773 --> 00:38:52,295
comics, the US did atomic bomb testing in the
South Pacific Ocean near where Krakoa lived.

403
00:38:52,736 --> 00:38:58,419
And actually that was what Professor X theorized
turned Krakoa into a sentient mutant, was that

404
00:38:58,439 --> 00:39:04,734
radiation. Dude, that's so much better than
what Hickman came up with. Yeah, that was actually

405
00:39:04,754 --> 00:39:09,875
Krakow's origin story before Hickman wrote the
new backstory. Wow. I'm pretty sure Krakow

406
00:39:09,895 --> 00:39:15,317
has been around radioactivity before and survived
just fine. So I don't think Danny's attempt

407
00:39:15,677 --> 00:39:21,699
to poison Krakow with uranium will do anything.
And if Danny's now a bunker, Krakow is just

408
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:27,980
gonna drain the life force out of Danny the
bunker and reduce him to, you know, Danny the

409
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:34,251
rivet. And then Danny the nothing, because he's
dead. But like... If Krakoa wasn't actually

410
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:40,276
mutated via radiation, then we don't know actually
if it was exposed to it, right? Like that was

411
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:46,982
just a theory. True. I say Professor X's theory
was wrong, and that Krakoa was never exposed,

412
00:39:47,282 --> 00:39:54,588
and that Krakoa withers and dies, well, Danny
survives. Off of spam and tank. Pfft. Ha ha

413
00:39:54,608 --> 00:39:59,512
ha. Well, let's go ahead and leave the match
there. Either... Danny poisons Krakoa with

414
00:39:59,592 --> 00:40:06,184
uranium by becoming... uranium mines teleporting
all over the island, or Krakowa drains the

415
00:40:06,265 --> 00:40:12,649
life force from Dany as the island can do with
any life form that exists on its surface. Let's

416
00:40:12,669 --> 00:40:16,131
go ahead and find out which of these scenarios
happens by inputting the character stats, running

417
00:40:16,171 --> 00:40:23,275
the simulations, and coming back with a winner.
AG9K, hit it! Inputting data. Running calculations.

418
00:40:23,756 --> 00:40:29,695
Processing results. Simulations complete. I
think actually that speculation went better

419
00:40:29,775 --> 00:40:35,358
than I thought it would, because with Krakoa,
I just had to come up with these natural disasters,

420
00:40:35,458 --> 00:40:40,721
essentially, considering Krakoa is a natural
landmass. So it was easier than I thought it

421
00:40:40,741 --> 00:40:45,263
was going to be, honestly. Yeah, it wasn't too
bad. The stats were not easy, I would say,

422
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:50,746
and they're very different from any other characters
that we've done before. Things like movement

423
00:40:50,806 --> 00:40:56,602
speed were interesting. We said that Danny,
since he could teleport, was much faster. than

424
00:40:56,622 --> 00:41:02,123
a Krakoa who's essentially stationary. Neither
of these guys evade and their fighting skill

425
00:41:02,183 --> 00:41:08,205
is basically non-existent. Yeah, the stats that
Krakoa really shined in where Danny wasn't

426
00:41:08,305 --> 00:41:14,626
quite up to snuff were durability and damage.
Yeah, Danny could get injured pretty easily,

427
00:41:15,247 --> 00:41:20,408
even just by breaking one of his glass panes.
And he's not very offensive, so his damage

428
00:41:20,428 --> 00:41:25,629
stat category was much lower than Krakoa's.
However, in addition to speed, Danny also excelled

429
00:41:25,769 --> 00:41:30,591
in intelligence because we said Danny's a little
bit smarter than Krakoa, who largely operates

430
00:41:30,631 --> 00:41:35,512
off of instinct. But we said that Danny was
also more perceptive. Yeah, thanks to his spatial

431
00:41:35,552 --> 00:41:40,613
sense that allows him to teleport to locations
and find people. Danny definitely has this

432
00:41:40,633 --> 00:41:47,055
like psychic readout thing going where he knows
exactly what form to take wherever he's teleporting

433
00:41:47,115 --> 00:41:52,637
to. So we accounted for that in his perception.
But both can perceive largely everything that

434
00:41:52,837 --> 00:41:59,507
occurs within them. Right, exactly. Both Krakoa
and Denny are highly versatile, able to do

435
00:41:59,607 --> 00:42:04,509
essentially anything they want with their own
existence, which makes them highly adaptable.

436
00:42:04,529 --> 00:42:09,911
With all these stats in mind and their disparities
and similarities accounted for, Jonathan, who

437
00:42:09,931 --> 00:42:13,453
do you think is walking away with the win on
this? I personally think Denny the Street is

438
00:42:13,473 --> 00:42:18,855
going to win just because he's faster and smarter.
Instagram disagrees with me apparently.

439
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:30,353
I was surprised actually. I was surprised just
because, you know, Kakoa has never been seen

440
00:42:30,813 --> 00:42:35,496
in live action before, whereas Danny the Street
has. So you think that Danny the Street is

441
00:42:35,536 --> 00:42:40,700
actually more popular than Kakoa? I would have
assumed so. I think a lot of people are taking

442
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:46,784
landmass into consideration because an island
is a much bigger size than a street. True,

443
00:42:46,944 --> 00:42:51,147
but like Danny the Street can't accommodate
for that. He could become the size of a planet

444
00:42:51,187 --> 00:42:55,978
if the circumstances are correct. You're not
wrong. But I have the results here. Here you

445
00:42:56,018 --> 00:43:06,363
are, sir. The winner between Danny the Street
and Krikoa is Danny the Street. Yes. Which

446
00:43:06,664 --> 00:43:15,228
surprises me. Really? Honestly. Yeah. Danny
the Street out of 1000 matches, won 573 of

447
00:43:15,248 --> 00:43:22,993
them or 57.3 percent of the time, whereas Krikoa
only won 427 or 42.7 percent of the time. The

448
00:43:23,213 --> 00:43:28,417
biggest disparity. within their stats was speed.
Cause apparently Danny the Street can just

449
00:43:28,457 --> 00:43:33,821
teleport all over the place wherever he wants.
That speed advantage of Danny's cannot be overcome

450
00:43:33,981 --> 00:43:39,426
by Krakoa's durability and damage. And then
you have like the intelligence thing kind of

451
00:43:39,506 --> 00:43:44,069
putting Danny a little over the edge. I called
it. Honestly, I think another way this fight

452
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:49,294
would really play out is that Danny would sense
how lonely Krakoa is just as the solitary island

453
00:43:49,594 --> 00:43:53,997
and then become a planet for him to occupy itself
on. I thought he would just drown the island.

454
00:43:55,774 --> 00:43:59,857
It is pretty interesting the way it played out.
I just think about how much damage like these

455
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:05,281
creatures that Krikoa manifests could do to
a street. But in the end, that was unable to

456
00:44:05,321 --> 00:44:09,544
help Krikoa get the win, especially when he
considered that Danny could have created his

457
00:44:09,704 --> 00:44:14,968
own life to combat those monsters as well if
he chose to. I don't know. These stats are

458
00:44:15,008 --> 00:44:18,891
like largely theoretical and I guess there's
like a thousand different ways the match could

459
00:44:18,911 --> 00:44:23,758
have gone. It's just that Danny wins slightly
more of them. Boom! But that does it for this
