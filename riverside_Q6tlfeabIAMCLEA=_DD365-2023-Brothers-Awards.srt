00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,958
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,366 --> 00:00:28,469
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:33,453
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters and stat-based

4
00:00:33,614 --> 00:00:39,178
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother Johnny DC. And Happy New Year

5
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:44,843
everyone! Yeah, welcome to 2024! Yeah, and this
year Jonathan and I will have had this podcast

6
00:00:44,883 --> 00:00:50,949
running for a total of 8 years. Holy shit. 8
years, people. We started this show in 2016.

7
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:57,152
And holy crap, it's been going on a while. Like,
if you honestly told me that there were enough

8
00:00:57,212 --> 00:01:01,875
Marvel and DC characters to put in these many
duels and this many Marvel and DC related media

9
00:01:01,915 --> 00:01:07,358
to review, I would have told you to go fuck
yourself. Geez. All right. It's kind of a dream

10
00:01:07,398 --> 00:01:12,881
come true, right? For comic book fans, 2023
may go down in history as the year that comic

11
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:18,964
book fatigue finally set in. But honestly, I'm
still enjoying most films. Yeah. Who's not

12
00:01:18,984 --> 00:01:24,384
fatigued? This guy right here. I'm pointing
to myself because 2023 had a lot of great stuff

13
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:29,188
come out for Marvel and DC. And in this episode,
our annual Brothers Awards episode, we will

14
00:01:29,228 --> 00:01:34,173
award the best that the company has produced.
Yeah, this is the eighth annual Brothers Award

15
00:01:34,213 --> 00:01:39,637
episode. Of course, we named it the Brothers
Awards off of the DC versus Marvel comic book

16
00:01:39,657 --> 00:01:46,123
and mini series that came out in the mid 90s,
which depicted two cosmic entity twin brothers

17
00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:51,620
that each represented both Marvel and DC. So
we figured that the name of the award was fitting.

18
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:57,926
Yeah, and we represented those cosmic entities
as little statues that we award these films.

19
00:01:58,026 --> 00:02:03,392
You could check out the images of these awards
on our Instagram. Little statues? I've always

20
00:02:03,432 --> 00:02:07,576
imagined them as being like pretty big fucking
statues, dude. I thought they were like Oscar

21
00:02:07,636 --> 00:02:13,794
sized, you know? No, no, we're thinking like
Statue of Liberty, bro. All right. Before we

22
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:17,116
get into our awards, we're going to break down
the latest comic book movie news that came

23
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:21,278
out this past week, of which there was none.
Partially because Jonathan and I are recording

24
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:26,241
this episode early, but also because, you know,
we're like in a dead zone in terms of movie

25
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:31,845
news. Yeah, it's pretty quiet during the holidays.
But, we do have a No Prize to award and a new

26
00:02:31,885 --> 00:02:35,807
question of the week for you guys. As always,
we list our segment times in our episode description,

27
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:39,969
so feel free to check out the show notes if
you want to skip ahead to a particular topic.

28
00:02:40,722 --> 00:02:45,095

49
00:04:45,182 --> 00:04:51,487
But with that out of the way, quick to the no
prize. A no prize is an award Marvel used to

50
00:04:51,507 --> 00:04:57,572
give out to fans. Our version, the dynamic dual
no prize is a digital award we post on Instagram

51
00:04:57,752 --> 00:05:02,655
and in our email newsletter. for the person
that we feel gave the best answer to our question

52
00:05:02,675 --> 00:05:07,897
of the week. In last week's question, we asked,
which actor would you choose to recast Kang

53
00:05:07,957 --> 00:05:13,299
in the MCU and why? Of course, that was coming
up with the news that Jonathan Majors was fired

54
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:19,362
as King of the Conqueror from Marvel. We got
three answers here. So, you know, two honorable

55
00:05:19,382 --> 00:05:23,363
mentions and one no prize winner. Let's go ahead
and run them down. Our first honorable mention

56
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:29,902
goes to Chumnu, who said, Hello, if I could
recast Kang, I would probably recast. Busta

57
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:37,808
Rhymes because you know, he can portray like
a, what's it called, like a menacing type of

58
00:05:37,848 --> 00:05:45,154
demeanor. And I just feel like he would fit
the role, you know, because Kang is very menacing

59
00:05:45,174 --> 00:05:51,480
himself. So thank you for your time. Thank you
for listening. So Cham Ngu gave the answer

60
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,724
of Busta Rhymes. Honestly, I've only ever seen
Busta Rhymes in one movie and that was Halloween

61
00:05:56,764 --> 00:06:05,631
Resurrection. And he was Fucking horrible in
that movie. This is a horrible answer. Everyone

62
00:06:05,651 --> 00:06:09,654
knows that if you're gonna hire a rapper to
play King of the Conqueror, it's either gotta

63
00:06:09,674 --> 00:06:17,541
be Ice Cube or Ice T. One of the ice guys. Not
vanilla ice. Fuck that guy. But I think Ice

64
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:22,565
T could pull it off. He kinda has a cool demeanor.
He's a little up there in age. So is Cube though.

65
00:06:22,585 --> 00:06:28,970
They're all getting older. It's so sad. Or,
or, hear me out. You hire Coolio? And it turns

66
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:34,892
out that his character from the director's cut
of Daredevil was also Kang. He was a Kang variant.

67
00:06:35,072 --> 00:06:45,577
Coolio's dead, bro. Oh no! Really? Yes! I didn't
know that! Dude. Whoops. I mean, we have AI

68
00:06:45,597 --> 00:06:51,119
now. It's fine. You may as well said Tupac or
something. Jesus. Oh, fuck you. I know he's

69
00:06:51,339 --> 00:06:55,681
dead. Anyway, let's go to move on to our next
honorable mention after that poor showing from

70
00:06:55,721 --> 00:07:01,700
Jonathan here. Our next honorable mention goes
to Andrew Shunk, who said, Hey guys, Andrew

71
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:11,684
Shunk here. I would cast Christopher Judge for
Kang. So this is kind of a very dark horse,

72
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:18,667
but he's from the Stargate SG-1 series. He's
also the voice of Kratos from the God of War

73
00:07:18,707 --> 00:07:26,710
series. I think it's something where he could
pull it off. Yeah, Christopher Judge had a

74
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:31,992
prominent role in the Stargate SG-1 series.
He's one of the other dimensional tough guys,

75
00:07:32,272 --> 00:07:35,994
basically. I don't know. I never watched the
show, but I know of the character. He's kind

76
00:07:36,034 --> 00:07:40,436
of like a interesting looking face. Yeah, he
was in The Dark Knight Rises, although it was

77
00:07:40,456 --> 00:07:45,478
a very minor role. He was like assassin number
three or something like that. Interesting.

78
00:07:45,938 --> 00:07:52,301
But I would say that he has an interesting look.
I guess he's a decent actor. I never really

79
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:58,168
watched the Stargate TV series. Yeah. But I
wonder if he's maybe not a big enough name

80
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:03,251
for Kang, someone who, you know, the MCU is
hindering their entire multiverse saga on.

81
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:07,994
I don't know. I mean, he has fan cred, I would
guess. But I just don't think he's that great

82
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:12,556
of an actor, though far be it for me to judge
anybody on a show that I have not seen. So

83
00:08:12,596 --> 00:08:16,879
who knows? Did you know that Jason Momoa was
on one of the Star Gate shows? I did know that.

84
00:08:16,939 --> 00:08:22,374
Yeah. He's on Stargate Atlantis. A precursor
of things to come. So great answer Andrew Shunk,

85
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:29,020
but the winner of this week's no prize is Travis
Herndon, who said, Hey guys, Travis here. So

86
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:34,625
my pick would have to be Chuck Woody Wooji.
I think he did an amazing job in Guardians

87
00:08:34,665 --> 00:08:41,191
3 and I think he could pull off being Kang.
Now I know he's already played high evolutionary

88
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:46,556
before, but you can easily have it and not only
he stood the new variant, but you can even

89
00:08:46,616 --> 00:08:52,479
have it at Kang. Kang was a different Kang variant
that just took a different path compared to

90
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:58,361
the other versions of Kang. So that's my pick.
Honestly, I don't love any of these answers,

91
00:08:58,401 --> 00:09:03,243
but I do have to say that Chuck Woody Iwuji
is the best actor out of the bunch. That's

92
00:09:03,263 --> 00:09:07,065
true. Yeah, that's why Travis Herndon wins this
award. Yeah, I didn't love any of the answers

93
00:09:07,345 --> 00:09:13,948
either, but they were in fact answers. And yeah,
Chudwuki is really solid as he proved in the

94
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:18,806
Peacemaker television show and in Guardians
of the Galaxy Vol. 3. With the nature of the

95
00:09:18,886 --> 00:09:24,270
multiverse, you can literally cast anybody and
say that they're just a variant. So, that's

96
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:29,514
why I don't hate this answer. But also, it would
be weird for the high evolutionary to be a

97
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:34,017
variant of Kang, I feel. Who knows, it may just
have been a variant who wasn't interested in

98
00:09:34,077 --> 00:09:39,641
time, but more interested in biology. They can
make it work if they needed to. You know, rumors

99
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:44,864
are that Mads Mikkelsen, who played Kasellius
in the Doctor Strange movie, is being courted

100
00:09:44,904 --> 00:09:50,676
for the role of Victor Von Doom. I also hate
that. Well the idea there, according to fan

101
00:09:50,696 --> 00:09:55,418
theories, is that they would actually retcon
the character of Casselius so that it was an

102
00:09:55,598 --> 00:10:02,122
alias for Victor Von Doom as he was studying
to be a sorcerer. You know, in the comics Victor

103
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:06,825
was learning magic as a way to circumvent death,
which is exactly what Casselius' motivations

104
00:10:06,885 --> 00:10:10,987
were in Doctor Strange. And you know, he already
has the fucked up face because of what the

105
00:10:11,007 --> 00:10:16,530
Dark Dimensions forces did to it, so it could
work. I take it back. that's actually kind

106
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:22,074
of brilliant. I don't hate it, honestly. Well,
if you had to recast Kang, who would you cast?

107
00:10:22,574 --> 00:10:27,598
Well, I think the correct answer here was John
Boyega, who played Finn in the Star Wars sequel

108
00:10:27,638 --> 00:10:31,861
trilogy. The guy who was done dirty in the Star
Wars franchise, and I think he deserves some

109
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:36,244
redemption in the Marvel universe. He has gone
on Twitter saying he's not interested in the

110
00:10:36,284 --> 00:10:40,947
role, but I think for the right price, anybody
would be interested. Seriously, if I was coming

111
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:45,651
to Feige, I'd be like, what's the number? Just
tell me the number. Write it down, write it

112
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:54,358
down. I'll add a zero. As in I'll add a plus
sign and then zero. Geez, final offer. Anyway,

113
00:10:54,838 --> 00:10:58,241
thanks to everyone who called in this week,
guys. Congrats to Travis Herndon for winning

114
00:10:58,281 --> 00:11:02,304
this week's No Prize. If you the listener want
a shot at winning your own No Prize, stay tuned

115
00:11:02,324 --> 00:11:06,347
to later on this episode when we'll be asking
another Question of the Week. And now that

116
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,689
that's done, on to the Question of the Week.

117
00:11:13,134 --> 00:11:18,556
So now that Aquaman and The Last Kingdom has
been released, the DCEU has come to an end.

118
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:26,419
And we want to know, now that it's finished,

124
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:48,961
January 6th.

125
00:11:56,206 --> 00:12:00,369
But I think now we're ready to move on to the
main event of this episode, where we award

126
00:12:00,409 --> 00:12:04,814
the best that has come out from Marvel in DC
in the year 2023. We're going to go ahead and

127
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:09,818
roll out the red and blue striped carpet. We're
going to get in our tuxes. Let's go ahead and

128
00:12:09,838 --> 00:12:12,601
move into the 2023 Brothers Awards.

129
00:12:21,646 --> 00:12:25,508
With all of the guests have made their way into
the auditorium where we're presenting the awards

130
00:12:25,668 --> 00:12:32,211
of which there are 10 categories. Best trailer,
best original music, best new on-screen character,

131
00:12:32,672 --> 00:12:42,377
best villain, best hero, best moment, best actress
and best actor, best series or special, and

132
00:12:42,417 --> 00:12:48,220
finally best picture. There was so much media
to pour over for Marvel and DC both on the

133
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:53,280
small screen and the big screen. When it came
to Marvel specifically, the media that was

134
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,624
eligible that was released in 2023 are Ants
Man and the Wasp Quantumania, Guardians of

135
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:08,431
the Galaxy Vol. 3, Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse,
Secret Invasion Season 1, Loki Season 2, The

136
00:13:08,491 --> 00:13:11,313
Marvels, and What If Season 2.

137
00:13:17,346 --> 00:13:23,209
Harley Quinn, a very problematic Valentine's
Day special, Legion of Superheroes, Shazam!

138
00:13:23,329 --> 00:13:31,453
Fury of the Gods, Batman! The Doom that came
to Gotham, Titans Season 4, The Flash, Justice

League Warworld, Blue Beetle, My Adventures

and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. Holy shit!

141
00:13:46,421 --> 00:13:51,573
It's a lot. A spoiler warning, if you haven't
seen any of these movies or shows from the

142
00:13:51,593 --> 00:13:58,137
past year, there is the potential that we will
spoil something for the nominees this episode.

143
00:13:58,678 --> 00:14:02,440
Yeah, DC had way too much stuff come out this
year, like almost double the amount of Marvel's

144
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,523
projects. It was just too much because no one
cares about DC. Are we gonna have to throw

145
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:12,227
down on this stage? Is that what's gonna happen?
It depends on what I think of your words. But

146
00:14:12,247 --> 00:14:17,151
let's go ahead and hear them, starting with
our first category. best trailer. Trailers

147
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:22,474
exist to get us excited for upcoming films and
television series. They are marketing material

148
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:28,338
that show us the tone and tease the story. If
they're done right, which they often are when

149
00:14:28,378 --> 00:14:33,862
it comes to Marvel and DC projects, it gets
us fans all aboard the hype train. Yeah, these

150
00:14:33,882 --> 00:14:39,346
trailers not only got fans boarded upon the
hype train, they also smashed barriers of doubt

151
00:14:39,686 --> 00:14:45,034
and uncertainty to make everyone super excited.
At least until the films came out. Yeah, sometimes

152
00:14:45,054 --> 00:14:49,656
the trailer is actually better than a movie.
Very true. But let me list the nominees for

153
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:57,180
best DC trailer this year. The nominees are
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom official trailer.

154
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,541
If you lead, the Seven Kingdoms will follow.

155
00:15:06,978 --> 00:15:09,149
Blue Beetle official trailer.

156
00:15:15,216 --> 00:15:15,601
choice

157
00:15:18,934 --> 00:15:26,753
The Flash official trailer 2. You wanna get
nuts? Let's get nuts.

158
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,255
Shazam! Fury of the Gods official trailer 2

159
00:15:44,894 --> 00:15:50,758
It's a great list. I'm going to guess that your
ward is going to the Flash. The Akuma trailer

160
00:15:50,778 --> 00:15:54,219
was also pretty good, but we got it so late
in the game that it was kind of lacking in

161
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,542
that aspect. But the Flash, I think, actually
got us really excited at the time it came out

162
00:15:58,642 --> 00:16:04,825
because it gave us the best look into what looked
like a really exciting riff on the Flashpoint

163
00:16:04,865 --> 00:16:13,346
story. And the winner is the Flash official
trailer 2. Called it. You guessed right. That

164
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:17,769
flash trailer, I mean, all of the trailers for
the flash were amazing, but that one specifically

165
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:24,073
got me super pumped because I had so many great
moments within it. It felt very Snyder in a

166
00:16:24,093 --> 00:16:28,917
way to me, in a way that I tried to capture
emotion and just this awesome spectacle because

167
00:16:28,977 --> 00:16:35,241
the visuals were pretty incredible. The score
was sweeping and heartfelt. And you can't top

168
00:16:35,281 --> 00:16:41,245
the nostalgia factor of hearing Michael Keaton's
Bruce Wayne say, you want to get nuts? OK.

169
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:47,873
Let's get nuts. And the trailer was nuts. I
really like the shot where it was the two flashes

170
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:53,716
and Supergirl like coming at the camera as the
backdrop was like zooming out, you know. Yeah,

171
00:16:54,036 --> 00:16:59,379
that was a neat effect. I also really like the
shot where Michael Keaton's Batman ejects from

172
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:03,581
the Batplane as it's like exploding in the air.
There was just a lot of exciting things to

173
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:07,924
get thrilled over. Yeah, yeah. There's also
the shot at the very end that closed out the

174
00:17:07,964 --> 00:17:13,659
trailer where we see Batman diving through the
night sky. And the Batplane is in the distance

175
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:18,602
against the moon. What a beautiful shot. I was
so good. I was so unbelievably pumped for this

176
00:17:18,642 --> 00:17:22,725
movie. For sure. Yeah, I mean, I think this
is maybe one of the instances where the trailer

177
00:17:22,765 --> 00:17:26,407
actually was better than the movie, but you
know, a lot of people had a lot of different

178
00:17:26,427 --> 00:17:30,610
feelings on the flash. Let's go to move on to
the Marvel best trailer. You're right, hold

179
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:36,054
on. Let's strike one. You had salt DC two more
times. We are throwing down on this stage.

180
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:42,179
I've been salted DC like 10 times already this
episode. Strike one. All right. I won't stand

181
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:42,559
for it.

182
00:17:52,403 --> 00:18:02,372
one thing. What's that... time? Echo official
trailer You have so much pain in you

183
00:18:06,866 --> 00:18:12,909
Someone's rage. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.
3, new trailer.

184
00:18:17,252 --> 00:18:17,435
ride.

185
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,279
The Marvels teaser trailer.

186
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,108
team. Oh no we're not a team.

187
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:40,152
I'm trying to think of which of those trailers
got me most pumped to see the show. I think

188
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:45,594
the Echo trailer is pretty intriguing in that
it's so very different from anything else that

189
00:18:45,614 --> 00:18:52,017
we've received from the MCU television series
wise. But I think even more so than that, the

190
00:18:52,037 --> 00:18:58,280
trailer that got me most excited to see a Marvel
film was Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. So

191
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:06,224
that's my guess. And the winner is... Echo.
official trailer. I mean, did I say Guardians

192
00:19:06,244 --> 00:19:11,789
of the Galaxy? I'd gone with my first pick.
I said Echo. Ant-Man and the Wasp, Quantumania,

193
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:16,733
and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 all had great
marketing ahead of those releases, but a lot

194
00:19:16,753 --> 00:19:21,897
of it was kind of to be expected. We knew that
they were going to be fun, special effects

195
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:26,701
driven films, largely sticking to Marvel's brand.
I will say that the Marvel's teaser trailer

196
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:30,984
actually got me really excited for that movie,
and that was an instance where maybe the trailer

197
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:36,675
actually was better than the movie. Even more
than all of those other ones, Echo got me super

198
00:19:36,715 --> 00:19:42,537
hyped because I was not looking forward to Echo
at all. And when that trailer came out and

199
00:19:42,577 --> 00:19:46,279
we saw how brutal everything is, where we see
people like straight up shoot each other in

200
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:51,101
the face and you know, Kingpin beats a man to
death by punching him in the face. It was a

201
00:19:51,161 --> 00:19:57,864
massive signal to fans that the brutality that
we were used to from the Netflix shows, specifically

202
00:19:57,904 --> 00:20:03,467
the Daredevil Netflix show was returning. And
that is all the news I ever needed to hear.

203
00:20:03,948 --> 00:20:08,212
Yeah, and thank goodness, holy cow, because
I was worried for a second when it came to

204
00:20:08,253 --> 00:20:13,238
shows like Hawkeye and She-Hulk and what they
did with the Netflix characters. I'm really

205
00:20:13,258 --> 00:20:17,543
glad to see that Marvel Studios is making a
course correction. Yeah, and the Echo show

206
00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:21,207
comes out soon here, we'll be reviewing it in
just a few weeks. I'm looking forward to it,

207
00:20:21,668 --> 00:20:25,650
mostly because of this trailer specifically.
Let's go ahead and move on to our next award,

208
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:31,612
which is Best Original Music. Now, this award
goes to the movie or show that had the best

209
00:20:31,852 --> 00:20:39,234
overall musical original score. Music is a huge
factor in the quality of these films and television

210
00:20:39,274 --> 00:20:44,736
shows. A great score can make a great movie
even greater, but it can even make a mediocre

211
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:49,750
movie even greater. And I feel like that's the
case for quite a few films. for Marvel and

212
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:55,253
DC this year. Yeah, given that both companies
had some mediocre films, but awesome scores

213
00:20:55,333 --> 00:21:01,256
across the board. Let me run down the list of
my nominees for DC's Best Original Music. The

214
00:21:01,316 --> 00:21:04,857
nominees are, Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom.

215
00:21:19,534 --> 00:21:20,333
Blue Beetle.

216
00:21:35,054 --> 00:21:35,679
The Flash.

217
00:21:50,582 --> 00:21:51,729
Merry little Batman.

218
00:22:06,498 --> 00:22:12,562
Those all had great scores. Merry Little Batman
was a very unique score. But I think you're

219
00:22:12,602 --> 00:22:18,427
going to give the award to the Flash primarily
because of how it was able to incorporate so

220
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:26,232
many different themes from other DC heroes across
the decades, from the 1989 Batman to even Christopher

221
00:22:26,272 --> 00:22:34,534
Reeve Superman. And the winner is. Blue Beetle.
So you are wrong. Largely because I was really

222
00:22:34,594 --> 00:22:40,057
focusing on originality for this award. We had
recently heard Denny Elfman's Batman in the

223
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:45,479
Joss Whedon version of Justice League when that
came out in theaters. So it wasn't as exciting

224
00:22:45,499 --> 00:22:51,502
or as nostalgic I think this time around. Unfortunately
I did really like the Flash score and I almost

225
00:22:51,522 --> 00:22:57,444
gave it the award. But I decided ultimately
to go with Blue Beetle because it was a score

226
00:22:57,644 --> 00:23:02,999
unlike anything we have heard before. And I
may be a little bit biased because of my Latin

227
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:07,583
heritage, but there was just something about
the music that I thought was incredibly moving

228
00:23:07,703 --> 00:23:14,329
and touching and nostalgic. Not only that, but
I also really liked the music in the movie

229
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:20,554
that wasn't original. There were some timeless
mariachi classics like Sinti and Sabor a mi

230
00:23:20,634 --> 00:23:26,679
from Los Panchos that just made the movie even
more moving for me. Yeah, I would describe

231
00:23:26,719 --> 00:23:32,643
the Blue Beetle score as mostly electronic with
some like Latin Beats, some industrial stuff

232
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:37,327
a little bit too. It wasn't like a super sleek
score. It kind of had some heaviness to it,

233
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:42,211
you know? And it was also semi nostalgic in
that it kind of invoked 90s vibes with like

234
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:46,895
its synthetic electronic score, like you mentioned.
So yeah, I thought it was definitely the best

235
00:23:47,115 --> 00:23:52,140
score of the year and a year with a lot of great
scores. Yeah, same goes for Marvel. Let me

236
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:57,564
go ahead and run down the nominees for best
Marvel original music. The nominees are Ant-Man

237
00:23:57,584 --> 00:23:59,065
and the Wasp, Quantum Mania.

238
00:24:13,806 --> 00:24:15,993
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3

239
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:32,072
Loki Season 2

240
00:24:46,894 --> 00:24:48,761
Spider-Man across the Spider-Verse.

241
00:25:03,726 --> 00:25:09,028
I'm going to go with Guardians of the Galaxy
only because I feel like James Gunn does a

242
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:14,432
really good job with music. Now of course he's
not the composer for that film, but I also

243
00:25:14,492 --> 00:25:18,894
remember the music just being really moving
in that film in general. And the winner is

244
00:25:20,475 --> 00:25:25,798
Loki Season 2. Well that of course was going
to be my second guess because I also really

245
00:25:25,838 --> 00:25:30,080
like the music in Loki. I'm surprised your second
guess was in Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse

246
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:36,713
because that movie nearly got this award. With
all the incredible music that was in that movie

247
00:25:36,793 --> 00:25:42,858
between Gwen Stacy's drumming and visiting Spider-Man
India's world and Miles Morales' Latin feeling

248
00:25:42,898 --> 00:25:47,602
theme, there was a lot to really like in the
Across the Spider-Verse soundtrack. However,

249
00:25:48,163 --> 00:25:54,328
I'm kind of punting that award to maybe the
next movie in that franchise, Beyond the Spider-Verse,

250
00:25:54,648 --> 00:25:59,192
and hopefully, you know, the score is equally
as good there. But for now, I want to give

251
00:25:59,212 --> 00:26:04,664
the award to Loki Season 2. largely because
I think Natalie Holt did excellent work on

252
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:09,368
both seasons of this television series. You
know, for Loki season 1, that almost got the

253
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:13,351
music award too, but I ended up giving it to
WandaVision just because of the varied nature

254
00:26:13,391 --> 00:26:17,474
of all the television themes that I thought
were done really well in that show. But Natalie

255
00:26:17,514 --> 00:26:25,240
Holt's Loki score is so moving, so beautiful,
and very, very unique among the superhero genre.

256
00:26:25,661 --> 00:26:30,855
With these really... ethereal synths and Nordic
feeling orchestral movements. It's just all

257
00:26:30,935 --> 00:26:35,677
so well done. But I just remember one of the
things that moved me so much in the final episode

258
00:26:35,777 --> 00:26:40,479
was the music. I think that music closed out
the show perfectly. I remember when Loki season

259
00:26:40,539 --> 00:26:45,021
one came out, I had chosen that as my pick for
what I thought was going to get the Brothers

260
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:49,343
Award for Best Music that year. Like you said,
it didn't. So I'm really glad that it's winning

261
00:26:49,363 --> 00:26:54,585
this year because it definitely deserves it.
The Loki score does a better job than I would

262
00:26:54,625 --> 00:27:00,590
say most. comic book properties of setting the
tone. Absolutely. Let's go to move on to our

263
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:07,056
next award, which is best new on screen character.
Yeah, like we mentioned earlier on in the podcast,

264
00:27:07,116 --> 00:27:12,460
if you had told us that comic book movies would
still be going strong for the most part, eight

265
00:27:12,501 --> 00:27:17,965
years into this podcast, I would not have believed
you. The fact that we're still getting new

266
00:27:18,005 --> 00:27:23,690
characters on screen is just a dream come true
for any comic book fan. Now, a lot of these

267
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:28,791
characters we've known and loved from the comics
for decades, but the fact that people are getting

268
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:33,893
to experience them for the first time on screen
is one of the true joys of being a fan. For

269
00:27:33,913 --> 00:27:39,034
sure. Seeing new characters represented in live
action or animation is one of the most exciting

270
00:27:39,094 --> 00:27:44,015
things about being a fan of the source material.
We had quite a few new characters for DC this

271
00:27:44,055 --> 00:27:51,097
year, so let's find out who's the best. The
nominees are Blue Beetle from Blue Beetle.

272
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:59,477
Kordax from Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.

273
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:07,981
Space Case from Doom Patrol Season 4.

274
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:15,297
Supergirl from The Flash.

275
00:28:20,094 --> 00:28:25,140
Obviously this has got to go to Blue Beetle.
It's not even a question. I mean, all great

276
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:30,186
characters, but yeah. My guess is Blue Beetle.
Oh, you're so sure of yourself, huh? Yep. The

277
00:28:30,226 --> 00:28:39,151
winner is... Blue Beetle from Blue Beetle. Of
course. Yeah, no, this one is probably a giveaway

278
00:28:39,271 --> 00:28:44,134
because the character was just so unbelievably
well realized on screen. Of course, it also

279
00:28:44,154 --> 00:28:49,897
doesn't hurt that of the nominees, he was the
only starring character. Yeah, Kordax and Space

280
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:54,300
Case had really minor roles, so did Supergirl
to a slightly lesser extent. But yeah, Blue

281
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,002
Beetle is probably one of the characters that
we never expected to actually get a movie despite

282
00:28:59,042 --> 00:29:04,265
how cool he was. And to see him finally on the
screen and realize actually so well from the

283
00:29:04,305 --> 00:29:09,227
comics. was a great feeling. I don't know if
I never expected it, but I definitely always

284
00:29:09,287 --> 00:29:14,448
wanted it because I always thought the character
had the potential to be as popular as Spider-Man

285
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:19,729
because he is essentially in some regards DC's
Spider-Man. He just has a really cool look

286
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:24,331
about him. He's just a really cool character
with really cool powers. And it was great again

287
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:29,112
to see that realized on the big screen. Well,
there are a few new characters on Marvel side

288
00:29:29,152 --> 00:29:34,853
as well. So let me go ahead and run down those
nominations. The nominees are High Evolutionary.

289
00:29:35,254 --> 00:29:37,401
from Guardians of the Galaxy, Volume 3.

290
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:44,751
Lahori from What If Season 2.

291
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:52,760
Kang the Conqueror from Ant-Man and the Wasp,
Quantumania.

292
00:29:57,618 --> 00:30:01,156
Spider-Man 2099 from Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse.

293
00:30:06,046 --> 00:30:13,108
Okay, I haven't finished What If Season 2 yet,
so I have no idea who that is, but I'm gonna

294
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:19,150
say that you went with Spider-Man 2099, because
I think they did a really good job adapting

295
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:25,993
that character. And the winner is... Kang the
Conqueror from Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania.

296
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:33,977
Gosh dang it! You're 0 for 3 so far. Some people
may say that Spider-Man 2099 is not a new on-screen

297
00:30:34,017 --> 00:30:38,581
character because he made an appearance in the
Into the Spider-Verse movie, the first film

298
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:43,424
in that franchise. But it was an after credits
thing, so I don't think it was really a proper

299
00:30:43,464 --> 00:30:47,987
introduction. I still consider him a new on-screen
character for Across the Spider-Verse. And

300
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:52,110
also, I don't actually think that was a solid
adaptation of the character from the comic

301
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:55,593
books. He was actually very different. Well,
I thought they improved upon him, honestly.

302
00:30:56,293 --> 00:31:00,735
I- don't agree with that either. They did. They
did. Okay. He was a cool character, just a

303
00:31:01,015 --> 00:31:06,316
slightly different version. But, Kang the Conqueror,
played by Jonathan Majors, and like this is

304
00:31:06,577 --> 00:31:11,018
obviously going to be awkward awarding it given
that Jonathan Majors is no longer playing the

305
00:31:11,058 --> 00:31:16,039
character. But, I thought he did fantastic in
the role. I thought Kang proved to be a great

306
00:31:16,139 --> 00:31:20,161
threat for Ant-Man and the Wasp. And as a fan
of the character from the comics, I really

307
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:25,315
like this take on the character. Well, no, I,
you know. He would have been my choice if it

308
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:30,579
were not for the controversy surrounding the
character and sort of the bitter sweetness

309
00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:33,982
that he's not returning to the role. Yeah, I
could totally see that. I do want to give a

310
00:31:34,002 --> 00:31:38,645
shout out to Kihori from What If Season 2. She
is an original character that was introduced

311
00:31:38,885 --> 00:31:44,330
in that season to Marvel, and what a great way
to kick off a character's origin. Let's go

312
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:48,673
ahead and move on to our next award, which is
Best Villain. Of course, the hero is only as

313
00:31:48,713 --> 00:31:54,211
good as his villain. And if a movie or show
doesn't have an adequate enough threat, then

314
00:31:54,491 --> 00:31:58,732
it's kind of a letdown, right? Villains can
really make or break a film. And these are

315
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:04,254
the best villains that appeared in 2023 that
we feel pose the greatest threat to our heroes.

316
00:32:04,594 --> 00:32:09,195
Right. And of course, being a great hero means
overcoming great threats. You can't do that

317
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:14,677
if you have a crappy villain who should be menacing,
cunning and powerful. Yeah, that's a great

318
00:32:14,697 --> 00:32:19,002
recipe to put heroes through the wringer. I'm
excited to hear who the best DC villains of

319
00:32:19,042 --> 00:32:25,173
2023 are. The nominees are Black Manta from
Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom.

320
00:32:30,126 --> 00:32:34,315
General Lane from My Adventures with Superman,
season one.

321
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:42,817
Yogg-Satha from Batman the Doom that came to
Gotham.

322
00:32:47,522 --> 00:32:49,812
Joker from Merry Little Batman.

323
00:32:54,530 --> 00:33:00,753
What an eclectic group of villains. Out of the
13 projects that you had to choose from, I

324
00:33:00,773 --> 00:33:03,935
guess I'm a little bit surprised that these
are your nominees, although I can't offhand

325
00:33:04,155 --> 00:33:09,159
name you better ones. I'm going to go with Black
Manta from Aquaman. That's my guess. And the

326
00:33:09,199 --> 00:33:16,923
winner is... Yogg-Sattha from Batman, the doom
that came to Gotham. Wow. All right, I will

327
00:33:16,963 --> 00:33:23,664
not lie. DC had a villain problem this year.
Of the 13 projects, it was really hard to come

328
00:33:23,724 --> 00:33:29,228
up with a list of solid villains this year.
But once I broke down all of the threats that

329
00:33:29,248 --> 00:33:35,954
the heroes faced, I don't think one was more
powerful, more evil, and more successful than

330
00:33:36,074 --> 00:33:41,238
Yogg-Sotha from Batman the Doom that came to
Gotham. It was an animated film, fantastic

331
00:33:41,258 --> 00:33:47,347
film, I loved the film, and I thought the villain
was next level. Yeah, Batman the Doom that

332
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:52,892
came to Gotham was an adaptation of a Mike Mignola
written Elseworlds series, very Hellboy-esque

333
00:33:52,952 --> 00:33:57,636
in its approach to the character of Batman and
his rogues and allies. Well, it was a Lovecraftian

334
00:33:57,676 --> 00:34:02,540
take on the Batman mythos. Yeah, and it was
fantastic. I remember loving that movie and

335
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:07,605
I do remember the tremendous ending that it
had. I don't really want to give it away here

336
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:13,089
because it was just too good to spoil. But yeah,
the villain was in some regards, successful.

337
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:18,456
and honestly could kick any other villains ass.
Like I'm sure your list of villains wouldn't

338
00:34:18,476 --> 00:34:22,881
be able to hold a candle to Yogg-Sotha. Oh,
don't be so sure about that. Let me go ahead

339
00:34:22,901 --> 00:34:29,009
and get into my list of Marvel villains. And
the nominees are Darben from the Marvels.

340
00:34:33,806 --> 00:34:36,356
Gravik from Secret Invasion Season 1.

341
00:34:41,058 --> 00:34:44,500
High Evolutionary from Guardians of the Galaxy
Vol. 3

342
00:34:49,314 --> 00:34:52,541
King the Conqueror from Ant-Man and the Wasp,
Quantumania.

343
00:34:57,362 --> 00:35:02,165
So the way this episode is cut, you probably
would not have heard me laughing after you

344
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:08,290
said Darben from the marvels, but I was like
hilariously because she was such a horrible

345
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:12,333
villain. I don't understand how she made it
on your list. So you definitely didn't choose

346
00:35:12,373 --> 00:35:17,677
her. I'm going to guess. And I'm hesitant to
do so because I'm 0 for 3 for this movie so

347
00:35:17,697 --> 00:35:25,102
far, I think. But Guardians of the Galaxy's
high evolutionary. And the winner is He became

348
00:35:25,142 --> 00:35:33,985
the Conqueror from Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania.
Clearly, I have a James Gunn bias. And I keep

349
00:35:34,025 --> 00:35:37,667
choosing Guardians of the Galaxy because I just
thought it was Marvel's best film this year.

350
00:35:38,207 --> 00:35:44,189
And you don't agree, I guess. High Evolutionary
was a great villain. I hated that guy. Maybe

351
00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:48,771
almost too much because I was really pissed
that they let him live. But also he was a little

352
00:35:48,791 --> 00:35:52,933
bit annoying with how much he freaking yelled.
I did not love Chirwooki Uwuji's performance

353
00:35:53,313 --> 00:35:58,056
in that film. But you know that I liked Jonathan
Majors as King of the Conqueror, who I think

354
00:35:58,276 --> 00:36:03,981
also posed a similar level threat to the heroes.
Okay, I mean, that's fair. They were definitely

355
00:36:04,041 --> 00:36:10,146
setting him up to be, of course, as we all know,
the big bad of Marvel's multiversal saga. And

356
00:36:10,206 --> 00:36:15,070
I guess I'm hoping at some point he gets to
the level of Thanos. I just don't think he's

357
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:20,294
quite there yet. But I think for what they had
here, King was the best part about Quantumania.

358
00:36:20,495 --> 00:36:23,377
I don't think you could say the same about the
other villains on my list, that the villain

359
00:36:23,397 --> 00:36:28,781
was the best part. That's fair. Yeah, that's
absolutely fair. But also, King would not beat

360
00:36:28,821 --> 00:36:34,145
the shit out of Yaksatha. So you're wrong. Yeah,
he would. He would go back in time to when

361
00:36:34,265 --> 00:36:40,769
Yaksatha was a little baby and then choke him
out. Oh, my gosh. What a strike to bitch. Why

362
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:47,174
strike to ain't nobody dissing Yaksatha? He's
like a Lovecraftian god of chaos from when

363
00:36:47,194 --> 00:36:53,510
he was a baby in another dimension outside of
King's like perception. There are no dimensions

364
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:59,794
outside of King's purview. Yes, yes there absolutely
are. Sorry. He's a three dimensional being

365
00:36:59,834 --> 00:37:05,277
like you or me. Some would say he's a fourth
dimensional being. Oh, okay, well, fuck them

366
00:37:05,377 --> 00:37:13,054
and you. Let's go to move on to our next award,
which is Best Hero. Stories have existed ever

367
00:37:13,094 --> 00:37:17,558
since humans came up with language. Going all
the way back to the Sumerian times, you had

368
00:37:17,598 --> 00:37:24,424
the hero of Gilgamesh taking on those primordial
deities. Heroes mean something to us as a species.

369
00:37:24,765 --> 00:37:28,928
They go through the trials and tribulations
of life and teach us lessons that we don't

370
00:37:28,988 --> 00:37:33,472
necessarily have to experience ourselves, but
love living vicariously through them. Yeah,

371
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:38,556
everybody loves a hero. Both Marvel and DC had
fantastic heroes that displayed all the tenets

372
00:37:38,596 --> 00:37:44,499
of great protagonists like sacrifice, compassion,
responsibility, and yes, I think I pulled those

373
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:52,844
from Merry Little Batman. Well, let me break
down the best heroes for DC in 2023. The nominees

374
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:55,845
are Blue Beetle from Blue Beetle.

375
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:02,377
Flash from the Flash.

376
00:38:07,298 --> 00:38:10,005
Little Batman from Merry Little Batman.

377
00:38:14,886 --> 00:38:18,775
Superman from My Adventures with Superman season
one.

378
00:38:23,542 --> 00:38:27,424
That's a solid list, I think any one of those
could take home the prize. But I'm gonna give

379
00:38:27,465 --> 00:38:32,789
it to The Flash largely because of the unique
lesson that he learned within his movie specifically.

380
00:38:33,129 --> 00:38:40,334
That's my guess. And the winner is... Superman
from My Adventures with Superman, Season 1.

381
00:38:40,755 --> 00:38:47,660
Brung again! I'm actually a little bit surprised.
Is it because it was such a wholesome and new

382
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:53,615
version of Superman character? that but also
because I think they really captured the essence

383
00:38:53,835 --> 00:38:59,718
of the character of Superman who is, I would
argue, the most heroic archetype that exists

384
00:38:59,798 --> 00:39:05,260
within comic book heroes. He is selfless and
he protects the innocent no matter the cost.

385
00:39:05,661 --> 00:39:10,743
We really saw aspects of the character in the
My Adventures with Superman show when he was

386
00:39:10,823 --> 00:39:14,985
putting himself in front of bullets and lasers
to protect Lois without even knowing that he

387
00:39:15,005 --> 00:39:20,667
was bulletproof or laser proof. It was such
a fantastic take on Superman. And as we mentioned

388
00:39:20,727 --> 00:39:26,028
in that review, it's really kind of unfortunate
that they didn't use this take in live action.

389
00:39:26,408 --> 00:39:30,749
For sure. Yeah, the My Adventures with Superman
cartoon was a great template for a live action

390
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:35,911
origin story for Superman and his supporting
cast. When it comes to other heroes from DC

391
00:39:35,951 --> 00:39:40,592
this year, you know, Blue Beetle really didn't
have control of the Blue Beetle suit and become

392
00:39:40,652 --> 00:39:45,953
heroic to the very end. The Flash committed
a, you know, arguably selfish act that kind

393
00:39:45,993 --> 00:39:50,788
of... derailed the entire timeline. And little
Batman, you know, also a little selfish and

394
00:39:50,808 --> 00:39:55,710
definitely disobedient. I thought Superman definitely
epitomized what it means to be a hero. Well,

395
00:39:55,730 --> 00:40:01,853
let's go ahead and see who the best Marvel hero
of 2023 was. The nominees are Ant-Man from

396
00:40:01,973 --> 00:40:03,813
Ant-Man and the Wasp, Quantumania.

397
00:40:08,546 --> 00:40:11,900
Rocket Raccoon from Guardians of the Galaxy
Vol. 3

398
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:18,539
Loki from Loki Season 2.

399
00:40:23,318 --> 00:40:26,399
Miles Morales from Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse.

400
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:36,352
This is also a good list of heroes. You even
have a villain on your list. Interesting. I

401
00:40:36,453 --> 00:40:44,677
think I'm going to go with Loki, mainly because
the way the show ended with Loki's arc from

402
00:40:44,737 --> 00:40:51,621
villain to hero was so unbelievably well realized.
So yeah, Loki, that's my guess. And the winner

403
00:40:51,701 --> 00:41:01,502
is Loki from Loki Season 2. About time! Finally
got one right. Damn! Yeah, no, I mean, you're

404
00:41:01,522 --> 00:41:07,524
entirely right. All the reasons that you stated.
The arc that Loki went through from his unsuccessful

405
00:41:07,564 --> 00:41:13,885
coup of Earth in the Avengers film, where we
saw that variant get arrested by the TVA, transformed

406
00:41:13,925 --> 00:41:21,267
from a selfish ego maniac into the most selfless
hero. He basically gives up his entire life

407
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:27,069
to make sure that everyone else gets to live
by overseeing the new branching timelines in

408
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:31,476
the new Marvel multiverse. It was an incredible
journey from start to finish. Yeah, it was

409
00:41:31,616 --> 00:41:35,800
unbelievably moving. I'm actually really glad
you're giving him the award because I wasn't

410
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:39,343
even considering him for some reason because
I always think of him as a villain. But yeah,

411
00:41:39,363 --> 00:41:44,348
what he did in the show is absolutely heroic.
Yeah, his heroic journey was very different

412
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:49,813
from Superman's in My Adventure with Superman,
but no less so heroic. Great choice. Very happy

413
00:41:49,853 --> 00:41:50,353
with that choice.

414
00:41:57,518 --> 00:42:02,039
Let's go ahead and move on to our next award,
which is best moments. Now, these are the onscreen

415
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:06,861
moments from Marvel and DC television and film
that we think were the best, whether that means

416
00:42:07,042 --> 00:42:13,424
most moving emotionally or most rousing in terms
of action and excitement or just something

417
00:42:13,444 --> 00:42:18,286
that we thought was really cool. You know, cool
factor goes a long way for this award. Yeah,

418
00:42:18,346 --> 00:42:23,208
saying that a movie scene had you on the edge
of your seat is kind of cliche, but these scenes

419
00:42:23,448 --> 00:42:28,432
absolutely had me on the edge of mind. but were
also incredibly memorable, which is what I

420
00:42:28,452 --> 00:42:34,356
would say is the main criteria for this award.
Here are my choices for DC's best moment. The

421
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:40,421
nominees are Aquaman vs Black Manta from Aquaman
and The Lost Kingdom.

422
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:48,501
Final Resolutions from Doom Patrol Season 4.

423
00:42:53,314 --> 00:42:55,421
Hullway Fight from Blue Beetle.

424
00:43:00,086 --> 00:43:02,416
Worlds collide from the Flash.

425
00:43:07,326 --> 00:43:12,750
Oh, those are all great moments. I think the
one that really sucker punched me right in

426
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:17,233
the gut though, the one that I did not see coming
and the one that I still can't get over is

427
00:43:17,334 --> 00:43:24,619
Final Resolutions from Doom Patrol Season 4.
That's my guess. The winner is... Final Resolutions

428
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:31,705
from Doom Patrol Season 4. I figured. So I almost
gave this award to Worlds Collide from the

429
00:43:31,765 --> 00:43:37,776
Flash. But the more I see that scene, the more
sort of it feels out of place with the whole

430
00:43:37,856 --> 00:43:42,878
movie in general, the more I notice just the
bad CG of it. I thought it was really cool

431
00:43:42,918 --> 00:43:47,000
in theaters at the time, and I think it's one
of the reasons why I gave the film the high

432
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:52,163
score that I did. But reminiscing on all the
different moments from this past year, from

433
00:43:52,243 --> 00:43:59,850
DC, the Doom Patrol finale was absolutely the
most moving. It was so- unbelievably bittersweet

434
00:43:59,870 --> 00:44:03,312
to say goodbye to these characters and see how
they're going to live out the rest of their

435
00:44:03,352 --> 00:44:09,274
lives, particularly when it came to the very
final scene of the show, which is Robotman

436
00:44:09,334 --> 00:44:15,617
witnessing the life of his grandson and then
dying as a result of being so at peace with

437
00:44:15,637 --> 00:44:21,439
that. How dare you bring that up again. Like,
oh, my heart, it's still broken. Yeah, I think

438
00:44:21,479 --> 00:44:26,381
that one's going to stay with me for a while.
So there was no way I couldn't give Doom Patrol

439
00:44:26,501 --> 00:44:32,342
that nod. It was a fantastic show, still one
of my favorite DC shows that I would recommend

440
00:44:32,362 --> 00:44:37,167
to anyone. And holy cow if you haven't seen
it I'm so unbelievably sorry for spoiling it,

441
00:44:37,287 --> 00:44:42,132
but definitely watch it, it's worth it. Totally
for sure. Let's go to move on to the best Marvel

442
00:44:42,172 --> 00:44:47,017
moments. The nominees are, Entangled Wrangle
from The Marvels.

443
00:44:51,862 --> 00:44:56,233
Escaping the Spider Society from Spider-Man
across the Spider-Verse.

444
00:45:00,842 --> 00:45:03,472
Loki's Ascension from Loki Season 2.

445
00:45:08,106 --> 00:45:11,452
Rockets Lament from Guardians of the Galaxy,
Volume 3.

446
00:45:16,154 --> 00:45:21,517
Oh man, this is gonna be a hard choice. Um,
but I'm gonna go out on a limb and say you're

447
00:45:21,537 --> 00:45:27,342
a big old softy like me and was really affected
by the cathartic closure of damn fine television

448
00:45:27,562 --> 00:45:35,427
and go with Loki's Ascension. And the winner
is Loki's Ascension from Loki season two. Knew

449
00:45:35,468 --> 00:45:41,932
it! I knew it! Yeah, great guess. I mean, Rocket's
Lament was moving, but in a very like depressing

450
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:48,312
way, right? It wasn't cathartic. Loki's ascension
at the end of Loki Season 2 though was cathartic.

451
00:45:48,492 --> 00:45:55,495
It was so satisfying and jaw-dropping and honestly
unexpected when he started restoring the multiverse

452
00:45:55,735 --> 00:46:01,258
and you know giving up everything to oversee
its existence. A damn fine culmination to the

453
00:46:01,278 --> 00:46:06,220
character and both seasons of the series of
Loki. Really couldn't ask for more. Yeah no

454
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:11,820
I agree like the finale to Doom Patrol Season
4. the finale to Loki season 2 is definitely

455
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:17,465
a memorable one and probably more memorable
than any other MCU show that has come out.

456
00:46:17,905 --> 00:46:22,109
I would agree, yeah for sure. Let's go ahead
and move on to our next award which is Best

457
00:46:22,369 --> 00:46:27,954
Actress. There are quite a few actresses for
both Marvel and DC that really seem to embody

458
00:46:28,114 --> 00:46:32,938
the character from the source material and yet
are also capable of making it their own for

459
00:46:32,978 --> 00:46:38,003
the screen. Yeah, they not only embody the character,
they also elevate. their roles, I think, to

460
00:46:38,023 --> 00:46:42,407
become something more than what's just lifted
off the page. There's some fantastic female

461
00:46:42,547 --> 00:46:46,531
characters from the comics, and we want to celebrate
the actresses who brought those characters

462
00:46:46,551 --> 00:46:54,958
to life in 2023. Let's find out the best from
DC. The nominees are Alice Lee as Lois Lane

463
00:46:55,198 --> 00:46:57,821
in My Adventures with Superman Season 1.

464
00:47:02,318 --> 00:47:06,061
Bruna Marcazzin as Jenny Cord in Blue Beetle

465
00:47:10,818 --> 00:47:15,769
Michelle Gomez as Madame Rouge in Doom Patrol
Season 4.

466
00:47:20,646 --> 00:47:24,153
Sasha Kaie as Supergirl from The Flash.

467
00:47:29,026 --> 00:47:37,932
This is an okay list. Um, I think it was- That's
strike three, motherfucker. It's go time. I

468
00:47:38,012 --> 00:47:42,736
think my guess would be Sasha Kaia as Supergirl
because although her role was small, I thought

469
00:47:42,756 --> 00:47:47,579
it was impactful. Did you not hear me say it's
go time? It's fucking go time. Ready, ready?

470
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:52,883
That's me slapping you across the face. Punching
you, right here. Dude, you're already down

471
00:47:52,903 --> 00:47:58,940
with the one slap. I just Will Smith'd you.
Clearly I was still punching afterwards, so

472
00:47:59,721 --> 00:48:09,686
no. And the winner is... Sasha Kaia as Supergirl
in The Flash. Yeah, makes sense. I really wanted

473
00:48:09,726 --> 00:48:15,089
to give it to one of the Doom Patrol actresses
because I think they're all great in that show.

474
00:48:15,389 --> 00:48:20,372
It's one of the reasons why the show is so great,
I believe. Michelle Gomez was definitely the

475
00:48:20,452 --> 00:48:25,295
highlight of this past season because she had
the largest role. And yet, she also came across

476
00:48:25,355 --> 00:48:30,098
as slightly annoying. So ultimately, I decided
to go with Sasha Kaia as Supergirl from The

477
00:48:30,118 --> 00:48:35,441
Flash just because of her acting ability. I
thought she did a fantastic job as the character.

478
00:48:36,074 --> 00:48:40,798
I'm actually kind of sad that we won't get to
see more of this version of Supergirl, and

479
00:48:40,858 --> 00:48:45,502
I really hope we get the chance to see Sacha
Kaeya in more work because she is extremely

480
00:48:45,542 --> 00:48:49,945
talented. Yeah, in just the 10 or 15 minutes
or so that she was on the screen, she really

481
00:48:49,965 --> 00:48:54,469
made her mark on the character of Supergirl,
I think. That will be highly influential, I

482
00:48:54,509 --> 00:48:59,413
think, in subsequent depictions. Yeah, not only
did she have a really cool look in the movie,

483
00:48:59,574 --> 00:49:06,183
but the way she emoted from sadness to rage
to bewilderment. She just did an amazing job.

484
00:49:06,584 --> 00:49:10,187
For sure, yeah, I totally agree with this pick.
Let's go ahead and move on to the Marvel side

485
00:49:10,228 --> 00:49:15,553
of things and find out who the best actress
there was. The nominees are Olivia Coleman

486
00:49:15,913 --> 00:49:19,317
as Sonya Fallsworth in Secret Invasion, season
one.

487
00:49:23,854 --> 00:49:28,231
Karen Gillan as Nebula in Guardians of the Galaxy
Vol. 3

488
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:37,207
Hailey Steinfeld as Gwen Stacy in Spider-Man
Across the Spider-Verse.

489
00:49:41,822 --> 00:49:45,456
Iman Velani as Ms. Marvel in The Marvels.

490
00:49:50,198 --> 00:49:57,487
Um, I think you're probably going to give this
award to Hayley Steinfeld for Across the Spider-Verse.

491
00:49:57,507 --> 00:50:04,515
It was a voice role, but I thought she did fantastic
in it. And the winner is... Hayley Steinfeld

492
00:50:04,796 --> 00:50:11,046
as Gwen Stacy in Spider-Man Across the Spider-Verse.
Right again! You're on a roll now, you were

493
00:50:11,066 --> 00:50:16,068
struggling in the beginning. Um, yeah, you're
right. Hailey Steinfeld's performance in Across

494
00:50:16,088 --> 00:50:21,491
the Spider-Verse as Spider-Gwen was very on
point. I thought she hit all the emotional

495
00:50:21,511 --> 00:50:26,813
beats harder than she needed to. It was really
easy to empathize with her character from the

496
00:50:26,873 --> 00:50:31,875
opening narration that she gave while she was
drumming to the end scenes when she is assembling

497
00:50:31,915 --> 00:50:35,817
the team to rescue Miles. I thought it was actually
an improvement over her performance in the

498
00:50:35,897 --> 00:50:39,841
first Spider-Verse movie. I feel like we really
got to know the character a whole lot better

499
00:50:40,101 --> 00:50:44,886
in Across the Spider-Verse. Yeah, it did not
hurt that they gave her some really special

500
00:50:44,926 --> 00:50:50,112
moments in this movie. Set in her own universe
with her own art style. But honestly, that

501
00:50:50,152 --> 00:50:56,019
wouldn't have meant much if the voice performance
is not up to par. Yeah, for sure. I do want

502
00:50:56,039 --> 00:51:01,263
to give a shout out to Iman Valani. from the
Marvels. I was heavily considering giving her

503
00:51:01,363 --> 00:51:06,045
this award, largely because she was I think
the best part about the Marvels, which is surprising

504
00:51:06,065 --> 00:51:11,247
considering you know she's a new actress. Yeah,
I agree. Fantastic job for her film debut.

505
00:51:12,187 --> 00:51:16,769
Finally, Olivia Colman gets nominated for something
and doesn't win, right? I thought she was great

506
00:51:16,789 --> 00:51:22,491
in the crown. Let's go to move into our next
category, which is best actor. Like the actresses,

507
00:51:22,671 --> 00:51:29,074
the dudes also have a substantial task in bringing
these characters Not all of them do it well.

508
00:51:29,615 --> 00:51:35,259
It is quite a feat, I think, to bring something
so fantastic to life. Oh yeah, absolutely.

509
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:40,903
But when they do get it right, there is no greater
joy to be had as a comic book fan. Let's go

510
00:51:40,923 --> 00:51:47,548
ahead and hear who the best DC actors were this
year. The nominees are Ezra Miller as The Flash

511
00:51:47,728 --> 00:51:49,849
and Young Barry in The Flash.

512
00:51:54,562 --> 00:51:58,808
Jack Quaid as Superman in My Adventures with
Superman.

513
00:52:03,606 --> 00:52:07,007
Michael Keaton as Batman in The Flash.

514
00:52:11,798 --> 00:52:15,245
Shalomari Doinya, as Blue Beetle, in Blue Beetle.

515
00:52:19,878 --> 00:52:24,559
I think between Jack Quaid and Ezra Miller,
surprisingly, I think I'm gonna go with Ezra

516
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:29,381
Miller. Despite the fact that he's kind of a
shithead in real life, I think he did a good

517
00:52:29,441 --> 00:52:33,983
job portraying two different characters in The
Flash, so that's my guess. And the winner is...

518
00:52:35,384 --> 00:52:41,550
Ezra Miller as The Flash and Young Barry in
The Flash. I feel like this is the year where

519
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:45,593
we're probably gonna get some shit for the awards
that we're handing out, considering we're handing

520
00:52:45,633 --> 00:52:52,598
awards to Jonathan Majors and Ezra Miller. Yeah,
this was definitely a really poor year in terms

521
00:52:52,859 --> 00:52:57,962
of actors for comic book adaptations, considering,
you know, we also had Amber Heard thrown into

522
00:52:57,982 --> 00:53:03,226
the mix. People just really did not like a lot
of the actors that were in comic book movies

523
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:08,842
this year, Ezra Miller being one of them, you're
right. But despite how... crappy the guy is

524
00:53:08,882 --> 00:53:13,746
in real life throwing chairs at people and stuff
like that. There's no denying the strong performance

525
00:53:13,786 --> 00:53:20,911
he gave is not just one but two different characters,
actually three, in The Flash. Yeah, despite

526
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:24,814
the fact that I never thought he was quite suited
to the role, he was enjoyable in the movie

527
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:29,657
and I think he convincingly pulled off different
characters. Yeah, there's a lot of people who

528
00:53:29,697 --> 00:53:34,020
don't think that, you know, he was right for
Barry Allen, and I could agree, but I also

529
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:41,144
see where Zack Snyder was coming from when casting
him. The Justice League was sort of a five-man

530
00:53:41,164 --> 00:53:46,988
band kind of trope and he fit sort of the silly
character archetype that the team needed. Carrying

531
00:53:47,008 --> 00:53:52,611
that into his solo movie, The Flash, I thought
he did a tremendous job acting against himself

532
00:53:52,851 --> 00:53:58,254
and with Michael Keaton and everyone else in
the cast. Yeah, I'm hoping that both Ezra Miller

533
00:53:58,534 --> 00:54:03,577
and Jonathan Majors are able to kind of redeem
themselves in real life so that way these awards

534
00:54:03,717 --> 00:54:07,507
don't age poorly. Oh no, we're definitely gonna
get some shit for them. No one's gonna remember

535
00:54:07,547 --> 00:54:11,409
these awards by the time Ezra Miller, Jonathan
Majors, and Amber Heard redeem themselves,

536
00:54:11,509 --> 00:54:17,413
if ever. But I'm sticking to it. Sometimes as
a fan, you have to separate the art from the

537
00:54:17,473 --> 00:54:21,576
artist if you're looking to get any sort of
enjoyment out of these films. Absolutely. Well,

538
00:54:21,596 --> 00:54:26,959
let's go to move on to the best of Marvel's
actors this year. The nominees are... Bradley

539
00:54:26,999 --> 00:54:31,281
Cooper as Rocket Raccoon in Guardians of the
Galaxy Vol. 3

540
00:54:36,078 --> 00:54:39,488
Tom Hiddleston as Loki in Loki Season 2.

541
00:54:44,034 --> 00:54:48,592
Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror in Ant-Man
and the Wasp Quantumania.

542
00:54:53,354 --> 00:54:57,681
Shamik Moore as Miles Morales in Spider-Man
Across the Spider-Verse.

543
00:55:02,346 --> 00:55:09,389
Wow, this may be the hardest one to guess yet,
but I'm gonna take a swing and say Shemeek

544
00:55:09,429 --> 00:55:17,353
Moore from Across the Spider-Verse. And the
winner is Tom Hiddleston as Loki in Loki Season

545
00:55:17,413 --> 00:55:22,135
Two. Okay, I mean, that's fair. They all could
have won. Honestly, they were all great performances.

546
00:55:22,555 --> 00:55:26,996
They were all fantastic performances. Again,
I think a lot of people are already aware,

547
00:55:27,036 --> 00:55:32,837
we're huge fans of the arc that Loki had throughout
all of his appearances throughout the MCU and

548
00:55:32,858 --> 00:55:38,419
how it culminated in the way it did at the end
of Loki season two. But Tom Hiddleston is a

549
00:55:38,499 --> 00:55:44,281
phenomenal actor. He's honestly an Oscar worthy
actor. I think if he just got an Oscar

550
00:55:47,914 --> 00:55:53,198
very technical, brilliant in his deliveries
and his choices that he makes. Absolutely.

551
00:55:53,258 --> 00:55:58,623
Yeah, Tom Hiddleston just needs to do like a
master class and how to be a fucking badass

552
00:55:58,743 --> 00:56:03,787
actor. But I loved Bradley Cooper as Rocket
Raccoon. I think that was his best performance

553
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:08,090
and it was just so moving from young Rocket
to although I don't think he voiced young Rocket

554
00:56:08,211 --> 00:56:12,955
actually, but you know, Rocket's journey was
so incredible as well going from basically

555
00:56:13,235 --> 00:56:17,923
this asshole raccoon to such a forgiving creature,
you know. for giving the high evolutionary

556
00:56:18,023 --> 00:56:22,087
despite everything that he had gone through.
That's why he was also a nominee for best hero.

557
00:56:22,507 --> 00:56:27,792
But yeah, the performance really enhanced that
arc. Same goes for Shamik Moore as Miles Morales.

558
00:56:28,293 --> 00:56:32,457
And of course, Jonathan Majors was great as
Kang. I thought he was really menacing, but

559
00:56:32,477 --> 00:56:39,664
I'm not about to give an award to a convicted
criminal. Okay. Strike four. I don't know what

560
00:56:39,684 --> 00:56:44,516
happens in strike four. I'll tell you what happens,
we move on to the next award category, the

561
00:56:44,556 --> 00:56:49,440
penultimate category, which is best series or
special. Essentially this category is like

562
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:54,845
the home media compared to the theatrical releases
for Marvel and DC, including both long form

563
00:56:54,885 --> 00:57:01,890
content and shorter content from entire seasons
to one hour specials. Sort of, I mean, DC does

564
00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:07,595
release direct to video stuff that is eligible
for the best picture category, but you're right,

565
00:57:07,615 --> 00:57:12,654
for the most part, the series or special nominees
are mostly enjoyed from home. And honestly,

566
00:57:12,714 --> 00:57:18,076
they're among my favorite projects. A lot of
it is long form content, serialized content,

567
00:57:18,536 --> 00:57:23,978
which is very fitting given the source material
which also is serialized. I love long form

568
00:57:23,998 --> 00:57:29,160
storytelling. Let me break down the nominees
for the best that DC brought this year. The

569
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,981
nominees are Doom Patrol Season 4.

570
00:57:36,834 --> 00:57:38,541
Harley Quinn, season four.

571
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:45,979
My Adventures with Superman Season 1.

572
00:57:50,606 --> 00:57:52,095
Titans Season 4

573
00:57:56,874 --> 00:58:00,555
It's really gonna come down to My Adventures
with Superman season 1 and Doom Patrol season

574
00:58:00,655 --> 00:58:05,997
4 because both were phenomenal. At the end though,
I think I'm gonna go with My Adventures with

575
00:58:06,037 --> 00:58:11,600
Superman just because it was less uneven than
Doom Patrol season 4. And the winner is...

576
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:18,502
My Adventures with Superman season 1. I feel
like I'm kind of on a roll. I don't know, I'm

577
00:58:18,522 --> 00:58:23,504
not counting. You were right in your reasoning
for why My Adventures with Superman beat out

578
00:58:23,564 --> 00:58:28,442
Doom Patrol. As moving as the Doom Patrol was...
There were some problems with it. Problems

579
00:58:28,462 --> 00:58:34,085
that did not exist for my adventures with Superman,
which was nearly perfect. I loved that series.

580
00:58:34,165 --> 00:58:39,687
I loved the take that they took with the Superman
mythos. I loved the animated style that they

581
00:58:39,727 --> 00:58:45,430
did as well. I never would have thought Superman
would have worked as a shonen anime, but it

582
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:50,732
absolutely does. They knocked it out of the
park and I can't wait for season two. I was

583
00:58:50,772 --> 00:58:55,990
not looking forward to this show. I watched
it begrudgingly. And then I walked away super

584
00:58:56,050 --> 00:59:01,353
thrilled that I did because I've never been
a fan of Superman really as a Marvel guy And

585
00:59:01,593 --> 00:59:08,396
this show made me a fan which is hugely commendable
That's the biggest compliment the show could

586
00:59:08,456 --> 00:59:13,558
ever receive the fact that it made marvelous
joe a fan of a dc character You guys heard

587
00:59:13,578 --> 00:59:19,060
it here. Well, I mean, I still like every single
other marvel character more than superman,

588
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:24,555
but uh, Yeah, superman's pretty cool now I'm
debating whether or not to give you a strike

589
00:59:24,595 --> 00:59:31,600
five. I definitely think that my praise of the
show is greater than the awards that you just

590
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:37,485
gave it. No, no, there's no award greater than
the Brothers Awards. We all know this. Let's

591
00:59:37,525 --> 00:59:42,369
go to move on to Marvel and hear what the best
series for that were. The nominees are Loki

592
00:59:42,669 --> 00:59:43,209
Season 2.

593
00:59:47,882 --> 00:59:49,808
Secret Invasion Season 1

594
00:59:54,326 --> 00:59:55,671
What if season two?

595
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:05,531
You only had three? Wait, what's the fourth
nominee? There is no fourth nominee. Holy shit,

596
01:00:05,571 --> 01:00:11,994
Marvel sucked this year! Well, the obvious answer
is Loki Season 2. Even though I haven't finished

597
01:00:12,034 --> 01:00:19,277
What If Season 2, I know it's not beating Loki.
And the winner is... Loki Season 2. I feel

598
01:00:19,297 --> 01:00:24,658
like I'm on a roll. You're not though. Damn,
barely, barely. What if season two is fantastic?

599
01:00:24,818 --> 01:00:29,360
I actually liked it more than what if season
one, but you're right, nothing touches Loki

600
01:00:29,380 --> 01:00:33,821
season two. Of course, Secret Invasion is not
even part of the discussion. That was a huge

601
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:38,462
letdown when it absolutely should not have been.
Like the worst part about Secret Invasion is

602
01:00:38,482 --> 01:00:42,524
that it did not live up to its potential. And
that's an even bigger crime in my book. Loki

603
01:00:42,544 --> 01:00:47,605
season two, I think, surpassed its potential.
I think it told an incredible story, as we've

604
01:00:47,625 --> 01:00:52,971
already discussed many times this episode. because
Loki has won a ton of awards and deservedly

605
01:00:53,031 --> 01:00:58,494
so. Yeah, no, I agree. Loki has been my favorite
Marvel show out of everything that's been put

606
01:00:58,534 --> 01:01:03,416
out on Disney Plus so far. And I'm really, really
glad that it went out on such a high note.

607
01:01:03,856 --> 01:01:08,959
It's absolutely deserving of this award. I just
can't believe Marvel put out such little content

608
01:01:09,019 --> 01:01:14,481
this year that you can't even come up with four
nominations. That is, wow, dropping the ball.

609
01:01:15,018 --> 01:01:18,959
Yeah, I mean, Echo was supposed to come out
this year, but they punted it to January and

610
01:01:18,979 --> 01:01:22,660
they didn't have any specials this year. So
yeah, I was stuck with three nominees. DC is

611
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:28,021
just crushing it, I guess. Let's go to move
on to our final award of the evening, which

612
01:01:28,081 --> 01:01:33,342
is Best Picture for Marvel and DC. You know,
this is like the top tier award. Like with

613
01:01:33,362 --> 01:01:37,444
the Oscars, everybody wants to know what the
best picture was of the year. Of course, this

614
01:01:37,484 --> 01:01:41,925
is even more important because it pertains to
Marvel and DC, who never win Oscars for Best

615
01:01:41,965 --> 01:01:46,246
Picture. But they're damn going to win a Brothers
Award. I mean, Black Panther and the Joker

616
01:01:46,506 --> 01:01:50,889
received nominations for best picture. But yeah,
why does that matter when they could win a

617
01:01:50,929 --> 01:01:57,972
brother's award? Exactly. Let's find out what
the best DC picture is for 2023. The nominees

618
01:01:58,172 --> 01:02:01,033
are Batman, the doom that came to Gotham.

619
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:06,288
Blue Beetle.

620
01:02:11,086 --> 01:02:11,740
The Flash.

621
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:17,667
Merry little Batman.

622
01:02:22,358 --> 01:02:26,721
I'm surprised to see Merry Little Batman at
this list, but it was such a cute movie that

623
01:02:27,102 --> 01:02:32,727
I guess it deserves to be here among the best.
I think it's kind of a toss-up between Blue

624
01:02:32,767 --> 01:02:36,630
Beetle and The Flash, although the Doom that
came to Gotham was everything you would ever

625
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:40,814
want it to be. I'm gonna go with The Flash though,
I think you're gonna give Flash best picture.

626
01:02:41,234 --> 01:02:50,774
That's my guess. The winner is... Blue Beetle.
Oh shit! Just lost your roll! Ha ha! Okay,

627
01:02:50,834 --> 01:02:56,140
so originally I was giving it to The Flash because
for as much hate as it gets, I still think

628
01:02:56,180 --> 01:03:00,705
that's a really good movie. When I first came
out of the theater after watching The Flash,

629
01:03:01,285 --> 01:03:07,632
I was so ecstatic that I gave the film a 4.5
rating, which I admit now is probably too high.

630
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:15,091
I think it's a solid 4 film. I also gave Blue
Beetle a 4. And in rewatching these films now

631
01:03:15,111 --> 01:03:19,554
that I own them, I have to say Blue Beetle,
in my opinion, is the better movie. I'm finally

632
01:03:19,634 --> 01:03:26,119
glad to see you admit to your bias. Dude, I've
admitted to this before. Like, I give wrong

633
01:03:26,179 --> 01:03:31,223
ratings all the time, more frequently than I'm
willing to admit. Like, the Joker got a wrong

634
01:03:31,263 --> 01:03:37,247
rating from me. The Flash definitely did. But
Blue Beetle did not. It was a fantastic time

635
01:03:37,287 --> 01:03:42,070
at the theater. It's why you go to the theater
to see these movies. but it was also a fantastic

636
01:03:42,150 --> 01:03:47,994
adaptation of the character and one that I really
hope James Gunn continues in the DCU. I agree.

637
01:03:48,575 --> 01:03:52,878
As far as Blue Beetle goes, I think there was
very little lacking in terms of what you would

638
01:03:52,938 --> 01:03:57,761
want or expect from a Blue Beetle origin story
movie. I don't know if the same could be said

639
01:03:57,781 --> 01:04:01,944
about the other nominees on this list. Like
when it comes to the Flash, I think what you

640
01:04:01,964 --> 01:04:06,587
would want and expect is a more direct adaptation
of the Flash Point paradox story, but Blue

641
01:04:06,607 --> 01:04:12,211
Beetle, they nailed. Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
I also loved the family themes that had, as

642
01:04:12,251 --> 01:04:18,273
I mentioned earlier, the music was fantastic
and the CG that it had was the best hands down

643
01:04:18,393 --> 01:04:23,095
that DC put out this year. I would totally agree
with that. Yeah, the movie looked incredible.

644
01:04:23,516 --> 01:04:28,578
Unlike shots from The Flash or even Aquaman
and The Lost Kingdom. Right, the latter of

645
01:04:28,638 --> 01:04:34,240
which wasn't even nominated for this award.
Same goes with Shazam Fury of the Gods. Well,

646
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,699
I don't think it'll be hard to guess what my
nominations were for Marvel. considering that

647
01:04:37,739 --> 01:04:42,350
Marvel only had four full-length pictures come
out this year. So let me run down them. The

648
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:45,677
nominees are Ants Man and the Wasp, Quantumania.

649
01:04:50,274 --> 01:04:52,148
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3

650
01:04:56,802 --> 01:04:57,397
the Marvels.

651
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:03,820
Spider-Man across the Spider-Verse.

652
01:05:08,558 --> 01:05:14,121
You're probably gonna give it to Across the
Spider-Verse, but man, I'm really, really hoping

653
01:05:14,161 --> 01:05:19,484
you actually give it to Guardians of the Galaxy
Volume 3, because I think that was my personal

654
01:05:19,524 --> 01:05:27,629
favorite Marvel film of the year. And the winner
is Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3. Yes! James

655
01:05:27,669 --> 01:05:32,151
Gunn wins, Joseph likes DC. I'm gonna count
that as a wrong guess, because I think you

656
01:05:32,171 --> 01:05:38,887
actually guessed that I was gonna pick Spider-Man
on that one. No, I- So, Spider-Man Across the

657
01:05:38,907 --> 01:05:42,609
Spider-Verse was incredible. I didn't get to
review that one because it came out the same

658
01:05:42,649 --> 01:05:46,991
week that my little baby girl was born. That
movie will actually always hold a special place

659
01:05:47,011 --> 01:05:51,634
in my heart because of that. But if I had gotten
the chance to review Spider-Man Across the

660
01:05:51,674 --> 01:05:55,656
Spider-Verse with you and Spies, I would have
told you how much I loved it. It's actually

661
01:05:55,777 --> 01:06:01,440
probably one of the best animated films I've
ever seen. But it's also just half a story.

662
01:06:01,880 --> 01:06:08,251
Whereas Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3... was
a culmination of a fantastic trilogy of films

663
01:06:08,551 --> 01:06:14,852
and was entirely satisfying as an end to these
characters' journeys. Yeah, absolutely. I really

664
01:06:14,892 --> 01:06:19,514
liked the Guardians of the Galaxy films and
I don't know, again, maybe I'm just a big softie,

665
01:06:19,534 --> 01:06:24,635
but I really like the way that the arcs ended
for the characters that we had grown to love

666
01:06:24,795 --> 01:06:30,957
in the MCU. Rocket Story was incredible. Star-Lord's
journey was fantastic. I'm really excited to

667
01:06:30,997 --> 01:06:34,879
see where that goes in the future. I think it
would have been hard to conceive of a better

668
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:41,105
way to end that franchise than what James Gunn
did with Volume 3. Honestly, if we were giving

669
01:06:41,585 --> 01:06:47,430
one Best Picture award for both Marvel and DC,
I would also give it to Guardians of the Galaxy

670
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:52,514
Volume 3. I thought it was better than any of
the movies that DC put out this year, and it

671
01:06:52,554 --> 01:06:58,159
really makes me look forward to what James Gunn
can do in the DC universe. Well, Across the

672
01:06:58,179 --> 01:07:02,646
Spider-Verse was also better than anything else
DC put out this year, so I mean, I think what

673
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:08,850
I just heard you say was that Marvel is better
than DC this year. So you admit it in 2023.

674
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:15,633
Yes. In the theater, Marvel was better than
DC. And I and I don't think you're going to

675
01:07:15,653 --> 01:07:22,077
find anyone who disagrees with that. Honestly,
you heard it here first, folks. Jonathan likes

676
01:07:22,117 --> 01:07:25,699
Marvel more than DC. I'm going to change your
name to read on the discord. He's

677
01:07:28,980 --> 01:07:33,699
just wait till the next Brothers Awards. OK.
I guarantee you Joker Folly I do is gonna blow

678
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:40,222
anything that Marvel does out of the water.
2024 is the year of DC. Maybe the year where

679
01:07:40,302 --> 01:07:45,465
DC embarrasses itself by producing a musical
that it had no right making. What is it with

680
01:07:45,605 --> 01:07:51,188
Marvel fans and musicals? Musicals are not bad.
I just saw Wonka in the theater. I didn't know

681
01:07:51,248 --> 01:07:56,231
it was going to be a musical. It was a musical.
It was fantastic. Musicals are not bad. Can

682
01:07:56,271 --> 01:08:02,803
Joaquin Phoenix even sing? You know he was in
a band, right? No. Well, now you do. Who wasn't

683
01:08:02,863 --> 01:08:09,888
in a band? You. That's true. But that brings
us to the end of this award show, guys. We

684
01:08:09,908 --> 01:08:16,112
hope you had fun recounting the best that Marvel
and DC had to offer in the year 2023. Really

685
01:08:16,132 --> 01:08:21,636
looking forward to 2024, kind of largely because
Marvel Studios is only putting out one theatrical

686
01:08:21,676 --> 01:08:27,941
release, Deadpool 3, and Sony, oh God, is putting
out two movies with Madame Webb and Kraven

687
01:08:27,961 --> 01:08:33,564
the Hunter. So. You might be right, Jonathan.
2024 might be the year of DC. I mean, I'm sure

688
01:08:33,804 --> 01:08:38,326
Deadpool 3 is going to be amazing. I just don't
think it's going to be up to the same caliber

689
01:08:38,346 --> 01:08:42,909
of film that Todd Phillips is going to make
with Joker Folly, I do. But of course, that's

690
01:08:42,929 --> 01:08:47,111
the only theatrical release that DC is putting
out this upcoming year. I feel like we live

691
01:08:47,131 --> 01:08:52,815
in fucking covid times. It's ridiculous. Freaking
actor and writer strikes, man. Yeah, those

692
01:08:52,835 --> 01:08:57,457
strikes really delayed a lot. It's a real shame.
But luckily, there's a lot to enjoy on the

693
01:08:57,497 --> 01:09:02,652
small screen. this year with television shows.
And direct-to-video animated features like

694
01:09:02,712 --> 01:09:08,395
Justice League Crisis on Infinite Earths, Watchmen,
Aztec Batman, Creature Commandos, Kite Man

695
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:13,879
Hell Yeah, and Suicide Squad Isakai as well.
Not to mention The Penguin. Altogether we're

696
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:19,222
looking at about 10 DC projects to review in
2024. It's going to be Slim Pickens for Marvel,

697
01:09:19,282 --> 01:09:24,325
it's unclear as to whether or not Agatha, Darkhold
Diaries is going to come out in 2024, same

698
01:09:24,345 --> 01:09:29,179
thing with Eyes of Wakanda. your friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man and Marvel zombies, but we'll see.

699
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:33,362
Maybe even Ironheart is going to come out this
year. I know that Daredevil was pushed to 2025,

700
01:09:33,902 --> 01:09:38,284
so the Brothers Awards might be a little bit
more predictable next December. I predict that

701
01:09:38,304 --> 01:09:42,146
I'm going to beat your ass when it comes to
guessing what you're going to choose. I predict

702
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:48,330
I'm going to beat your ass. Period. For life.
That does it for this awards episode guys.
