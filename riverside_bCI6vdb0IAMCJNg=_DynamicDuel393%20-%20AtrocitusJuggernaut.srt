00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,963
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,302 --> 00:00:28,924
And welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:28,944 --> 00:00:34,726
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:40,889
I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm his twin brother
Johnny DC. And guys, this is the episode where

5
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:47,912
we find out who'd win in a fight between the
Red Lantern Atrocitus and the Juggernaut. Holy

6
00:00:47,952 --> 00:00:53,263
shitballs, this is going to be an awesome episode.
I cannot believe it has taken us until year,

7
00:00:53,363 --> 00:00:59,687
what is this, eight, nine, to get to a Juggernaut
duel. Shame on us. It's a crime for sure. Yeah,

8
00:00:59,748 --> 00:01:06,072
Juggernaut is one of the most powerful Marvel
characters out there. And I don't think Atrocitus

9
00:01:06,092 --> 00:01:11,776
has a chance in hell of winning this duel. I
mean, the guy punches strong. What else is

10
00:01:11,816 --> 00:01:17,307
there? Oh, you'll find out. later on as we get
into the characters' backstories, and then

11
00:01:17,347 --> 00:01:21,449
we'll run their stats in a thousand simulations
to come out with a definitive winner. Before

12
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:24,711
that, we're going to break down the latest comic
book movie news that came out this past week,

13
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:29,674
which we got a lot of. There was the new Captain
America Brave New World official teaser, we

14
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:35,597
got the Agatha All Along teaser trailer, as
well as the Watchmen Chapter 1 Red Band trailer.

15
00:01:36,077 --> 00:01:39,679
A lot to talk about, but as always, we list
our segment times in our episode description,

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,561
so feel free to check out the show notes if
you want to skip ahead to a particular topic.

17
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,906

including Max Destruction, which pits your

28
00:02:42,491 --> 00:02:47,735
favorite action heroes from film and television
against each other. This week, hosts Ken and

29
00:02:47,775 --> 00:02:53,300
Scottie are pitting Schwarzenegger's Conan the
Barbarian against King Leonidas from 300. I

30
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,703
know we said that last week, but in their last
episode they actually reviewed Conan the Barbarian.

31
00:02:58,224 --> 00:03:03,948
On the Senjoworld podcast, hosts Zachary Hepburn
speculates on fights between fan favorite anime

32
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:09,393
and manga characters. The show is currently
on a season hiatus, but it's coming back in

33
00:03:09,413 --> 00:03:15,180
a few weeks. So this is the perfect time to
catch up on Send Your World's 40 episode library.

34
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,803
And on the Console Combat podcast, hosts John
and Dean find out who would win in fights between

35
00:03:19,863 --> 00:03:23,925
popular video game characters. In yesterday's
episode, they found out who would win in a

36
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:30,048
battle between Codsworth from Fallout 4 and
Clap Trap from Borderlands. So it was like

37
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:36,112
a BattleBots episode. Visit dynamicpodcasts.com

to all of the shows in the DynaMic Podcast
Network. But with that out of the way, quick

39
00:03:41,715 --> 00:03:48,738
to the no prize. A no prize is an award Marvel
used to give out to fans. Our version, the

40
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:53,581
dynamic duel no prize, is a digital award that
we post on Instagram for the person that we

41
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:58,984
feel gave the best answer to our question of
the week. Last week we asked you guys, what

42
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:03,526
other Marvel or DC character would you like
to see get a cultural re-imagining for a one-off

43
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:08,649
special? And this was coming off of the Batman
Ninja versus Yakuza League teaser trailer that

44
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:12,919
we got. the week prior, we were saying what
other kind of concepts you guys could come

45
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,620
up with that was similar to Batman Ninja. And
we got a lot of great answers. Like all of

46
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,421
them were great. It was really hard to pick
the honorable mentions and winner this week.

47
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:27,903
But the first honorable mention goes to Travis
Herndon, who said, What's up, Donn and Medoos.

48
00:04:27,943 --> 00:04:33,625
Travis here. Shout out to my twins. So my answer
had to be Spider-Man, but with an African style

49
00:04:33,705 --> 00:04:39,824
makeover. You can even go for a more mystical
route with him that instead of like a regular

50
00:04:39,884 --> 00:04:44,526
spider total, it could be a Nazi, the spider
from African mythology. I mean, that would

51
00:04:44,546 --> 00:04:48,187
be cool, like a mystical Spider-Man. Like imagine
that kind of Spider-Man teaming up with Black

52
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:54,170
Panther. So that's my answer, African Spider-Man.
This was such an awesome answer. African Spider-Man,

53
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:58,912
of course, there's the African deity and Nazi,
the spider. So it totally makes sense that

54
00:04:58,972 --> 00:05:02,718
there would be an African Spider-Man and, you
know, his stories could take place. in early

55
00:05:02,798 --> 00:05:08,803
Africa and it works so well for the character,
especially since Anansi is always depicted

56
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:13,587
as kind of like a trickster, jokey kind of god.
But the answer is too good because it's already

57
00:05:13,627 --> 00:05:19,071
actually been done in Marvel Comics. The very
first Spider-Man in the Marvel 616 universe

58
00:05:19,091 --> 00:05:24,796
was actually named Anansi and he was in Africa.
Yeah, that blew my mind. I loved this answer

59
00:05:24,836 --> 00:05:28,519
so much. I totally thought we were going to
give it the win until you were like, this is

60
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:35,161
actually already a thing. I was like, what?
And maybe Travis Herndon subliminally already

61
00:05:35,181 --> 00:05:39,365
knew that, and maybe that's why he gave it as
his answer. But yeah, great answer. Our next

62
00:05:39,385 --> 00:05:45,070
honorable mention goes to Cat Stevenson, who
said. Hi guys, it's Cat, first time caller,

63
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:52,277
long time listener. I think it would be really
cool to set Hawkeye in a wild Western setting.

64
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:58,374
I know it's one of the weirder things, but I
think a Sheriff Hawkeye thing would be really

65
00:05:58,454 --> 00:06:03,398
intriguing to watch, and I think it'd be super
fun. It'd be a good movie, different animation

66
00:06:03,438 --> 00:06:09,662
styles, and I would till to see a bow and arrow
duel scene. That would be epic. Alright guys,

67
00:06:09,822 --> 00:06:14,966
hope you have a good day. Bye bye. This is a
really fun answer. I think having Hawkeye set

68
00:06:15,006 --> 00:06:20,162
in the days of the Old West using his bow and
arrow instead of gun slinging... fight villains

69
00:06:20,282 --> 00:06:24,663
as like the sheriff of this old west town. That's
perfect. I could totally picture it in my head.

70
00:06:24,723 --> 00:06:29,324
Like maybe he was trained by Native Americans
at the time and the use of the bow and arrow

71
00:06:29,584 --> 00:06:34,486
and he just prefers to use that and he's like
shooting down the barrels of bad guys guns

72
00:06:34,586 --> 00:06:38,907
as they're like set to draw and everything like
that. It would be fantastic. Yeah, seeing like

73
00:06:38,947 --> 00:06:44,548
a high noon type duel and the dirt roads of
the old west with a bow and arrow would be

74
00:06:44,648 --> 00:06:49,910
wild. Wild west. And they could probably name
the movie Wild West. And then they have like

75
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:56,016
a giant spider in it. And Nazi. Oh, my God,
it's all it all makes sense. It's coming full

76
00:06:56,056 --> 00:07:02,742
circle. Great answer, cat. Our next honorable
mention goes to Colby Hentges, who said, Hey,

77
00:07:02,783 --> 00:07:10,310
boys, Colby Hentges, I'd like to see Dr. Strange
get a Celtic reimagining, less occult and mysticism,

78
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:15,546
more nature and druid kind of vibes. That's
what I want. That would be cool. Like have

79
00:07:15,566 --> 00:07:20,907
an old medieval style version of Dr. Strange.
Just reimagine him in that time period, probably

80
00:07:20,987 --> 00:07:25,548
set around Ireland or Scotland or something
like that, the old Celtic region, and have

81
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:30,330
a more of a, yeah, Druid nature bound type of
spell caster. I think that works pretty well

82
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:36,131
for the master of the mystic arts. I'm actually
not too familiar with Druid shamanism and how

83
00:07:36,171 --> 00:07:40,653
it compares to something like occultism. So
I'd actually be really interested to see that.

84
00:07:40,953 --> 00:07:46,279
Well, it's like a lot of animal and plants.
control, like nature control type stuff, right?

85
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,941
Gotcha. That'd be totally cool to see. And I
would love to see it like in that, like book

86
00:07:50,981 --> 00:07:55,604
of Kells, Wolfwalkers type animation style.
That'd be really cool. Oh, hell yeah. Yeah,

87
00:07:55,624 --> 00:07:59,166
that's really cool. That's a great idea. Great
answer, Colby. We want to give a special shout

88
00:07:59,186 --> 00:08:04,489
out to Micky Matangian who suggested the idea
of a Filipino flash, which was a great concept.

89
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:08,651
I think we were just looking for more of a hook
there. Also shout out to Cyrus Moore who said

90
00:08:08,691 --> 00:08:12,533
he wanted to see stories about green lanterns
throughout American history, dating back to

91
00:08:12,553 --> 00:08:16,594
the Revolutionary War. which was just a little
bit more broad of a concept than we were looking

92
00:08:16,634 --> 00:08:20,756
for. But that does sound pretty cool too. Yeah,
I really liked both of those answers. But the

93
00:08:20,816 --> 00:08:28,898
winner of this week's no prize is Joseph Kirsting,
who said. Hi, it's Joseph Kirsting. The character

94
00:08:28,998 --> 00:08:36,860
I think is green arrow in ancient Greece. I
think you see him grow up under the rifle king.

95
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:43,810
Maybe a son of Apollo get banished by an evil
king. Him. fight his way back in a classic

96
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:54,536
hero quest and overthrow the evil king and become
a vigilante king hybrid and then it'd be pretty

97
00:08:54,556 --> 00:09:00,880
cool. Yeah, ancient Greek myths are heavily
influential when it comes to heroic storytelling

98
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:07,043
in comics in particular. It would be really
cool to see Oliver Queen among the pantheon

99
00:09:07,144 --> 00:09:13,735
of heroes that include like Hercules and Perseus
and Jason. His old school approach really works

100
00:09:13,795 --> 00:09:19,058
within that world, because you could also explain
his trick arrows as being divine or mythic

101
00:09:19,098 --> 00:09:24,921
in some way. Yeah, given to him by Apollo or
Artemis or something like that, fantastic.

102
00:09:24,961 --> 00:09:28,483
Yeah, that would be really cool. The way Joseph
described the story that he would wanna see,

103
00:09:28,523 --> 00:09:33,066
it sounds a lot like Perseus, and that's fine
with me. I think if you could retell some of

104
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:39,309
these ancient stories with superhero characters,
I think that'd be actually a pretty cool interpretation.

105
00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:43,665
That actually would be really cool. I would
read a series about that for sure. So great

106
00:09:43,705 --> 00:09:47,469
answer, Joseph. You win this week's No Prize.
If you the listener want a shot at winning

107
00:09:47,509 --> 00:09:52,414
your own No Prize, stay tuned to later on in
this episode when we'll be asking another question

108
00:09:52,434 --> 00:09:55,657
of the week. And now that that's done, on to
the news.

109
00:10:01,122 --> 00:10:06,585
Alright, this past week we got our first official
teaser trailer for the upcoming Captain America

110
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:13,048
Brave New World movie that's coming out on Valentine's
Day in 2025. I was really shocked when this

111
00:10:13,108 --> 00:10:16,830
trailer came out because I wasn't expecting
it to come out, but it makes sense considering

112
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:21,093
that they're starting to do fan screenings for
Deadpool and Wolverine and this teaser is almost

113
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:26,236
certainly playing before that movie. And I'm
here for it. I think my big takeaway from watching

114
00:10:26,256 --> 00:10:33,329
the trailer was that it perfectly captures the
vibe of the Captain America spy espionage thriller

115
00:10:33,449 --> 00:10:37,833
section of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That
tone was established in films like Captain

116
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:41,536
America The Winter Soldier, Captain America
Civil War, and of course the Falcon and the

117
00:10:41,556 --> 00:10:46,661
Winter Soldier Disney Plus television series.
It's my favorite pocket of the MCU, I think,

118
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:53,587
and this trailer gets me super pumped to revisit
that tone for these Marvel films. Yeah, it

119
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:59,622
totally gives off vibes of Winter Soldier for
me. I really didn't want to like this trailer

120
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:04,324
because you know Falcon and the Winter Soldier
I thought was okay. It had some great action

121
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:09,165
scenes, but I can't say I was really looking
forward to seeing this film in particular.

122
00:11:09,205 --> 00:11:14,727
Now I cannot wait to see this. It looks like
it's going to be everything that I hope the

123
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:19,248
MCU returns to. It just looks like it's going
to be really badass. For sure. Yeah, I mean

124
00:11:19,488 --> 00:11:23,809
if you watched Falcon and the Winter Soldier,
that show did have a villain problem with Flag

125
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:28,601
Smasher. But we got to see Falcon go up against
the likes of Batroc the Leaper, which was really

126
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:33,665
badass, and the Tunisia flight scene was probably
one of the most incredible action scenes out

127
00:11:33,685 --> 00:11:39,490
of any Marvel movie or show. Actually, I think
it'll be hard to top in this movie, but considering

128
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,794
we see Captain America going up against like
other fighter jets in a similar vibe to the

129
00:11:43,814 --> 00:11:47,777
first Iron Man movie, they might just be able
to accomplish beating the Tunisia flight scene.

130
00:11:48,202 --> 00:11:51,003
Yeah, I don't know if they're going to be able
to, but it looks like they're trying really

131
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:55,925
damn hard. You know, with the second wingman,
his sidekick, the new Falcon, I forget his

132
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,967
name. Yeah, Joaquin Torres. That's going to
be cool. And also looks like they're doing

133
00:12:00,007 --> 00:12:04,729
a callback to Eternals because there's been
a lot of speculation that whole flight action

134
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:10,252
scene takes place around Tiamat, the celestial
that was coming out of Earth's core. Yeah,

135
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:14,638
the big rumors that that's where Adamantium
is going to come from. I don't know if that's

136
00:12:14,658 --> 00:12:19,442
been confirmed or not, but that would be pretty
cool as a tie into the future X-Men franchise.

137
00:12:19,963 --> 00:12:25,887
Yeah, for sure. Now, the teaser trailer starts
with Sam Wilson meeting with President Thunderbolt

138
00:12:25,927 --> 00:12:30,931
Ross, formerly General Thunderbolt Ross, who
was played by William Hurt, who unfortunately

139
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:36,176
passed away prior to this movie filming. Harrison
Ford, we've talked about this recasting before.

140
00:12:36,456 --> 00:12:39,238
I think he's an inspired choice to replace William
Hurt.

141
00:12:43,406 --> 00:12:48,949
caliber and credibility with fans show up in
a Marvel film. I'm really excited to see Harrison

142
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:53,431
Ford in this role, especially since one of the
most exciting things about this trailer came

143
00:12:53,471 --> 00:13:00,595
from one of the end tags of the Red Hulk appearance.
Yeah, that was a fantastic way to end this

144
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:06,098
trailer. I got pumped up. Like the Hulk is my
favorite Marvel character. I honestly don't

145
00:13:06,138 --> 00:13:11,541
know too much about the Red Hulk. I know that
the angrier he gets, the hotter he gets, not

146
00:13:11,561 --> 00:13:16,964
like sexually. But like heat wise, yeah, the
angrier he gets, the more he emits heat radiation.

147
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:24,028
Okay, cool. Yeah. Uh, we need to get duel with
him in here soon, I think, or maybe closer

148
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:29,251
to the actual drop date of this film, but I'm
looking forward to that too. For sure. Yeah.

149
00:13:29,331 --> 00:13:33,553
I think one of the coolest things about this
whole trailer too, was this initial setup,

150
00:13:33,593 --> 00:13:39,597
this conversation between Sam Wilson and Thunderbolt
Ross and the premise that Ross wants to make

151
00:13:39,617 --> 00:13:42,862
Captain America a figure in the military once
again.

152
00:14:07,774 --> 00:14:12,395
It's also interesting because they already have
US Agent working for them, so why would they

153
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:17,458
need Captain America? That's a great point.
Probably because US Agent sucks. Yeah, fuck

154
00:14:17,498 --> 00:14:21,699
that guy! Although, he'll be showing up in the
Thunderbolts movie, so he might be able to

155
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:26,581
redeem himself there. As will Thunderbolt Ross,
apparently. We get some pretty good shots of

156
00:14:26,621 --> 00:14:31,864
Giancarlo Esposito's character. We don't quite
know who he's going to be playing, but the

157
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:37,466
rumor is that he's going to play a former SHIELD
agent named G.W. Bridge. who's actually a good

158
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:42,249
guy. The vibes that he gives off during this
trailer is that he looks kind of sinister,

159
00:14:42,409 --> 00:14:48,012
but that could also be translated as badass
as fuck. It was interesting to see Isaiah Bradley

160
00:14:48,032 --> 00:14:52,915
here who was in the Falcon and the Winter television
show. He was another super soldier, the first

161
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:59,579
black super soldier, and he tries to assassinate
President Ross. Yeah, not gonna lie, this trailer

162
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:05,994
definitely hit a little bit differently after
Trump's assassination attempt. It's a dark

163
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:10,957
reminder of what the world is actually like.
For sure. You know, there's actually a lot

164
00:15:11,017 --> 00:15:15,680
of shit going on in the real world that's affecting
this movie and actually even the Falcon and

165
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:20,423
the Winter Soldier because that show originally
had a plot dealing with a global virus. And

166
00:15:20,443 --> 00:15:26,286
now you have this movie with an attempted assassination
and also all the shit that's going on in Israel

167
00:15:26,366 --> 00:15:32,169
and Gaza right now. As a matter of fact, that
geopolitical situation has forced Marvel to

168
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:38,817
drop the moniker of Sabra from Shir Haas who
plays the character in this movie. I believe

169
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:43,580
the change that they're going with is that Ruth
Bat Sarraf is going to be a former black widow

170
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:51,124
as opposed to the Israeli hero. Can life stop
imitating art, please? For real, right? Hopefully

171
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:54,806
nothing else drastic happens like the White
House doesn't get destroyed or something like

172
00:15:54,846 --> 00:16:00,538
that. Yeah, if it's destroyed by like a red
hulk especially, I'm gonna be like, nope. We

173
00:16:00,578 --> 00:16:06,781
do get a slight glimpse of the back of the leader's
head, Samuel Stearns played by Tim Blake Nelson,

174
00:16:06,901 --> 00:16:10,984
and we hear his voice in this trailer too, actually.
Who knows what part the leader is going to

175
00:16:11,024 --> 00:16:15,166
play in this movie. If he's the one who's maybe
mind-controlling Isaiah Bradley because he

176
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:20,209
does have the power of telepathy in the comics,
maybe he has something to do with transforming

177
00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:25,912
President Ross into the Red Hulk. That would
make sense. But however it plays out, I'm super

178
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:30,304
here for this movie, man. I cannot wait to see
it. Yeah, I'm really looking forward to the

179
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:34,349
leader as a villain because we've been waiting
for him ever since the second film within the

180
00:16:34,429 --> 00:16:38,193
MCU, The Incredible Hulk. Right, yeah, they've
been sitting on the character for a while,

181
00:16:38,253 --> 00:16:42,358
so hopefully it's all worth the wait. Hopefully
this movie is better than the Falcon and the

182
00:16:42,378 --> 00:16:47,084
Winter Soldier television series, which we thought
was mostly okay. But that brings us to our

183
00:16:47,124 --> 00:16:47,925

190
00:17:43,224 --> 00:17:48,752
originals, this past week we also got our first
teaser trailer for Agatha All Along season

191
00:17:48,952 --> 00:17:52,634
one. I also was not expecting this trailer.
I don't even know what I was expecting from

192
00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:57,818
this show. I thought maybe it was gonna be quirky
and silly, similar to the early episodes of

193
00:17:57,838 --> 00:18:02,441
the WandaVision television series, but I was
kind of blown away by this trailer, honestly.

194
00:18:02,861 --> 00:18:08,926
Were you surprised, Jonathan? Dude, I was so
confused at the start of it. Like, it's a long

195
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:14,169
setup, right? Making you feel like you're in
some sort of dark police procedural. Yeah,

196
00:18:14,249 --> 00:18:19,784
I mean, It heavily evokes the television series
called The Killing, which is a fantastic television

197
00:18:19,824 --> 00:18:24,227
series. Actually, this series appears to be
evoking a lot of thriller and horror based

198
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:28,449
series, including The Killing, including, you
know, like even The Exorcist. There's a whole

199
00:18:28,469 --> 00:18:33,692
lot to enjoy here. And I'm actually really looking
forward to the show after not really anticipating

200
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:38,935
it at all. I think it'll be a good time around
the Halloween season. Yeah, I agree. This is

201
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:43,942
definitely a show that I don't think anyone
asked for. I mean, Agatha Harkness. getting

202
00:18:43,962 --> 00:18:50,204
her own television series. That's kind of crazy.
But I was really glad to see that this show

203
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:55,947
is invoking like a lot of different horror genre
tropes in the same way that WandaVision did

204
00:18:55,987 --> 00:19:01,570
with classic television. I think it makes it
a worthy successor of WandaVision in that regard.

205
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,512
Yeah, Agatha Harkness is not a popular Marvel
character for sure, definitely nobody asked

206
00:19:06,532 --> 00:19:12,879
for this series, but she does inhabit this very
specific corner of the Marvel Universe, specifically

207
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:17,301
witchcraft. You know, if you're talking about
witches, outside of the Scarlet Witch, Agatha

208
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:21,123
Harkness is like the biggest player in the game.
And it seems like they have an interesting

209
00:19:21,223 --> 00:19:26,886
story to tell here where we see that Agatha
was trapped in Wanda's spell. And since the

210
00:19:26,906 --> 00:19:31,609
Scarlet Witch died in the Multiverse of Badness,
there's no way for her to get out. So we have

211
00:19:31,889 --> 00:19:37,932
this other witch, Rio, played by Aubrey Plaza,
kind of snap her out of the spell and see if

212
00:19:37,952 --> 00:19:42,314
she can get her magic back, it looks like. Although
I'm not entirely sure Aubrey Plaza is a good

213
00:19:42,354 --> 00:19:47,016
guy or a bad guy here. She really comes across
as the same character that she played in the

214
00:19:47,096 --> 00:19:51,897
Legion television series, which is far and away
one of my favorite Marvel television series

215
00:19:52,037 --> 00:19:57,099
ever. But in that show, she played Lenny, who
was once possessed by the Shadow King. And

216
00:19:57,139 --> 00:20:01,800
I don't know if it's just Aubrey Plaza's demeanor
or cadence or something like that, but she

217
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,702
always comes across as a little kind of sinister.
I totally get those vibes as well. If they

218
00:20:06,742 --> 00:20:11,223
have any sort of multiversal aspect to the show,
it would be nice to get a callback to Lenny,

219
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:15,844
because Aubrey Plaza was just incredible in
the Legion television series. But here she

220
00:20:15,864 --> 00:20:22,046
plays a witch alongside Agatha. Agatha is going
to walk the Witch's Road, which is apparently

221
00:20:22,426 --> 00:20:28,468
a trial to get her magic powers back. And so
she assembles this coven of covenless witches,

222
00:20:28,548 --> 00:20:33,589
which looks like a lot of fun. Apparently this
includes Billy Maximoff, who is the son of

223
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:38,787
Wanda. I don't know who the actor is. I've never
seen him in anything. I've seen a lot of people

224
00:20:38,927 --> 00:20:43,910
praised his performance in Heartstopper. So
hopefully that translates to this show. No,

225
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:49,912
he's not actually Billy yet, right? Well, he's
credited, I believe, as just teen, but I think

226
00:20:50,352 --> 00:20:55,595
it's gonna be revealed that he is Billy. Okay.
A.K.A. Wiccan, a member of the Young Avengers.

227
00:20:56,075 --> 00:21:01,237
I wonder if we'll run into Speed as well this
series. His brother? Yeah, that would be fantastic.

228
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:05,327
I don't know if he fits. within the story that
they're trying to tell here about witches and

229
00:21:05,367 --> 00:21:09,868
magic, but it feels not right to see one brother
and not the other. I think it's fantastic that

230
00:21:09,988 --> 00:21:13,350
Marvel appears to be going full on horror with
this, you know, we did get a glimpse of that

231
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:16,631
with the werewolf by night special, but it looks
like they're taking that even further here

232
00:21:16,691 --> 00:21:21,313
with some truly scary seeming moments in the
teaser. Yeah, for real, at one point I was

233
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:26,915
like, what the fuck is this, the conjuring?
The show debuts on September 18th, I believe

234
00:21:26,955 --> 00:21:30,377
the first two episodes are going to come out
on that day, then each episode is going to

235
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:35,127
come out weekly into November. and we'll definitely
be reviewing it once all the episodes come

236
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:40,529
out. So look forward to that, but also look
forward to our upcoming review of Watchmen

237
00:21:40,569 --> 00:21:47,312
Chapter 1 for which a Red Band trailer was dropped
this past week. Now I don't have too much to

238
00:21:47,412 --> 00:21:53,334
say about the trailer other than it looks incredibly
faithful to the source material as we've talked

239
00:21:53,374 --> 00:21:58,756
about the teaser trailer that they did for parts
1 and 2. It looks like it's just the comic

240
00:21:58,796 --> 00:22:04,167
book panels in animated form. Actually watching
this trailer made me really appreciate how

241
00:22:04,307 --> 00:22:09,792
faithful Zack Snyder was to the source material
when it came to framing his shots from the

242
00:22:09,832 --> 00:22:14,977
comic. Yeah, I think the last time we talked
about this project, I mentioned how this animated

243
00:22:15,037 --> 00:22:19,941
Watchmen series of films just seems redundant,
especially when you have Zack Snyder's version

244
00:22:19,981 --> 00:22:25,867
out there. I still feel the same way. And in
fact, I actually like a lot of the line deliveries

245
00:22:25,967 --> 00:22:31,707
and voices given by the actors from Zack Snyder's
live-action film like Billy Crudup's voice

246
00:22:31,927 --> 00:22:37,371
as Dr. Manhattan was way better than Dr. Manhattan's
voice in this trailer and for this upcoming

247
00:22:37,471 --> 00:22:42,255
movie. Yeah, I won't disagree with that I thought
Billy Crudup's performance and voice performance

248
00:22:42,295 --> 00:22:47,458
specifically was phenomenal in the Watchmen
movie and some of the lines from this trailer

249
00:22:47,698 --> 00:22:52,381
Kind of felt like they were trying to imitate
the same delivery that they made in the live-action

250
00:22:52,422 --> 00:22:57,625
film Such as like maybe this was a political
killing things like that. Yeah, Jeffrey Dean

251
00:22:57,665 --> 00:23:02,274
Morgan's delivery of the comedians line, what
are you kidding, we're saving them from themselves,

252
00:23:02,334 --> 00:23:08,360
was like a lot more cocky and nuanced than this
voice actor who just seems like angry in one

253
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:15,107
note. So even after this trailer, I feel like
I'm less excited for it. Really? Yeah. I like

254
00:23:15,167 --> 00:23:20,653
the look of it. I'm glad that it exists in the
sense that more people are going to be exposed.

255
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:25,769
to the Watchmen story. Maybe people that would
never have picked up the comic, which you know

256
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:31,514
is hailed as maybe one of the best examples
of comic books as a medium. But also, the Watchmen

257
00:23:31,534 --> 00:23:35,937
storyline, I think, also translates to different
mediums pretty well. Well, in that regard,

258
00:23:35,977 --> 00:23:39,299
I think I would have rather had something like
a Watchmen video game or something like that

259
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,563
than this rehash of the Watchmen story, because
the Watchmen story never changes, right? I

260
00:23:44,604 --> 00:23:48,454
feel like there are so many other projects that
DC could have done. besides this considering

261
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:52,578
we got already a pretty faithful adaptation
of this story, we could have got something

262
00:23:52,618 --> 00:23:56,441
like, I don't know, a Hawkman animated film
or something like that. And that just seems

263
00:23:56,481 --> 00:24:00,704
like it would have been a better use of their
resources. I know Watchmen is a brand and everything

264
00:24:00,744 --> 00:24:04,808
like that, but I think telling the same story
over and over is just a missed opportunity

265
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:09,892
on DC's part, which is why I appreciated so
much what Damon Lindelof did with the Watchmen

266
00:24:10,092 --> 00:24:15,997
HBO television series. Oh, just like adding
to that universe? Yeah. Yeah, he did a fantastic

267
00:24:16,017 --> 00:24:20,364
job with that. I did notice that Paramount was
one of the studios responsible for this animated

268
00:24:20,404 --> 00:24:24,828
film. They of course helped produce the live
action film made by Zack Snyder along with

269
00:24:24,868 --> 00:24:30,193
Warner Brothers and I'm wondering if this maybe
is a push in some way for Paramount to make

270
00:24:30,313 --> 00:24:35,497
money. I know that the studio is being sold
currently and this may be like an easy cash

271
00:24:35,537 --> 00:24:40,021
grab considering the fact as we've learned since
the last time we reviewed the teaser trailer

272
00:24:40,041 --> 00:24:47,946
for this, Watchmen is apparently DC Comics best
selling published work. Like by far, year after

273
00:24:47,966 --> 00:24:52,007
year. More than like the Dark Knight or something
like that? Something bad? Yeah, oh yeah, absolutely,

274
00:24:52,107 --> 00:24:58,229
totally. That's weird. I mean, is it, it's a
really good piece of work. Of course the trailer

275
00:24:58,249 --> 00:25:03,291
was red banned for this film because it's gonna
have nudity in it. In the trailer, it even

276
00:25:03,471 --> 00:25:09,873
shows Dr. Manhattan's schlong, which is gonna
be weird to see animated. I wonder what kind

277
00:25:09,893 --> 00:25:14,563
of floppy effects that are gonna give it. Yeah,
it was pretty floppy in the live action movie.

278
00:25:14,783 --> 00:25:19,085
Not that I was paying too much attention, but
yeah, not that you were stepping frame by frame.

279
00:25:20,845 --> 00:25:24,947
But yeah, it looks incredibly faithful. From
the looks of it, the film may go up to the

280
00:25:25,027 --> 00:25:31,170
fearful symmetry chapter within Watchmen, which
I know was the halfway mark of the book. And

281
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:35,432
then part two will carry on the story from there.
Exactly. So like the prison sequences, the

282
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:41,040
breakout, all the squid stuff. That won't be
until next year. Chapter 1, of course, is being

283
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:47,149
released on August 13th, so we're just a month
away from reviewing it. Along with everything

284
00:25:47,229 --> 00:25:51,936
else that's being released around that time,
geez. For real. Disney and Warner Bros. decided

285
00:25:51,956 --> 00:25:55,421
to release everything all at once this summer.
It's ridiculous.

286
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:05,656
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and get into

287
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:11,009
our main event where we find out who would win
in a fight between the Red Lantern Atrocitus

288
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:12,793
and Juggernaut.

289
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:33,410
Alright, Atrocitus versus Juggernaut. These
are two extreme powerhouses from Marvel in

290
00:26:33,431 --> 00:26:39,136
DC, both wielding Crimson energies as it were.
You know, Atrocitus with his red lantern ring

291
00:26:39,436 --> 00:26:44,501
and Juggernaut with the Crimson Bands of Sidorak.
That was like a Doctor Strange thing, wasn't

292
00:26:44,541 --> 00:26:49,465
it? Yes, he has a spell called the Crimson Bands
of Sidorak which he uses to ensnare people.

293
00:26:49,626 --> 00:26:55,494
Now he invokes the same entity that the Juggernaut
is a champion of. but no, the bands that the

294
00:26:55,554 --> 00:27:00,336
Juggernaut wields are what provide him his armor.
It's not like he can summon an ensnaring spell

295
00:27:00,356 --> 00:27:05,498
or anything like that. All right, so these are
like bracelets? Yeah, pretty much. Okay, so

296
00:27:05,538 --> 00:27:11,961
it's like the tough guy wearing red jewelry
duel. Exactly. Another tiny between these characters

297
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:16,142
is that they're both magically powered. I know
that the Juggernaut is, but I'm not so sure

298
00:27:16,163 --> 00:27:22,025
about Atrocitus. Yeah, Atrocitus is like a shaman,
you could say. So their powers sort of come

299
00:27:22,065 --> 00:27:27,432
from magic in a way. Should be interesting,
but to explain the methodology behind our duels,

300
00:27:27,472 --> 00:27:33,217
let's go to our sentient duel simulator Alfred
Jarvis9000. AJ9K tell our listeners how you

301
00:27:33,257 --> 00:27:38,961
go about determining a winner in our duel matchups.
Yes, of course sir. The way I determine a winner

302
00:27:38,981 --> 00:27:44,226
between the contestants is by running 1000 Monte
Carlo simulations using the characters statistics.

303
00:27:44,726 --> 00:27:49,170
A Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic
model used to determine outcomes through random

304
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:55,022
sampling. In this case, I randomized the statistics
along a normal distribution. as a way to simulate

305
00:27:55,062 --> 00:27:59,646
the many variables that can occur during battle.
The stat parameters are based on the official

306
00:27:59,706 --> 00:28:05,010
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters'
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat

307
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:10,574
categories are included such as range, damage
potential, versatility and perception in order

308
00:28:10,614 --> 00:28:16,038
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.
The results of the 1000 simulations provide

309
00:28:16,058 --> 00:28:20,421
a percentage of wins for each character. The
contestant with the higher percentage is declared

310
00:28:20,461 --> 00:28:25,735
the victor as they have a higher probability
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,

311
00:28:26,116 --> 00:28:30,918
neither character should win 100% of the matches.
The comic book stories have shown that there's

312
00:28:31,058 --> 00:28:35,860
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so
the confidence rate of my method falls in line

313
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,482
with the precedents that have been established
in the source material. My mathematical simulations

314
00:28:40,502 --> 00:28:45,664
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes

315
00:28:45,704 --> 00:28:51,744
tabulated for determination of the winner. Thanks
AJ9K! Before we run the simulations though,

316
00:28:51,764 --> 00:28:56,507
we like to break down each character's histories
and abilities before improvising a scenario

317
00:28:56,587 --> 00:29:02,132
on how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations
would play out beat for beat. And it's my turn

318
00:29:02,152 --> 00:29:06,255
to go first this episode with the Marvel characters'
backstories, so let me go ahead and tell you

319
00:29:06,335 --> 00:29:13,240
all about Juggernaut. Kane Marco was born to
Marjorie and Dr. Kurt Marco, who was a nuclear

320
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:18,516
physicist from Berkeley, California. Kane's
mother died when he was three years old, leaving

321
00:29:18,556 --> 00:29:24,140
him in the hands of his abusive father. A troubled
child, Kane was sent to multiple boarding schools,

322
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,364
all of which he was expelled from. When one
of his father's colleagues, Dr. Brian Xavier,

323
00:29:29,524 --> 00:29:35,048
died in an accident at his research facility,
Dr. Kurt married Xavier's widower, Sharon,

324
00:29:35,428 --> 00:29:40,372
and he and Kane moved into her family estate
in Westchester, New York, along with her young

325
00:29:40,432 --> 00:29:47,247
son, Charles Xavier. Having a new family didn't
end Dr. Kurt's abusive behavior, who continued

326
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:53,149
to beat Kane and his new wife, though he spared
Charles, whom he seemed to prefer over his

327
00:29:53,229 --> 00:29:58,110
own son. Kane hated Charles for this, and he
began bullying his stepbrother relentlessly.

328
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:02,671
What he didn't know though was that Charles
was developing psychic abilities stemming from

329
00:30:02,711 --> 00:30:08,473
a genetic mutation, and was already experiencing
the mental and emotional turmoil that Kane

330
00:30:08,513 --> 00:30:12,936
and his mom were going through. You can learn
more about this in our Chief vs. Professor

331
00:30:13,056 --> 00:30:18,240
X duel episode. Ultimately, the abuse proved
to be too much for Sharon, and she succumbed

332
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:24,225
to alcoholism. Shortly after, Dr. Kurt Marco
died in a fire inside their mansion's home,

333
00:30:24,426 --> 00:30:30,151
leaving Charles and Kane as orphans. While Charles
would use his gifted academic mind to graduate

334
00:30:30,191 --> 00:30:35,435
high school early and earn multiple degrees
at home and abroad, Kane was pulled into the

335
00:30:35,475 --> 00:30:41,176
military. While serving on a mission in Asia,
Kain deserted his unit as they came under heavy

336
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:46,680
fire. Cowardly trying to navigate through the
jungle brush, he happened upon the lost secret

337
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:52,465
temple of Citorok, a powerful mystic deity.
Within, Kain happened upon the crimson gem

338
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:57,849
of Citorok, which looked like a giant glowing
ruby. Planning to steal it, Kain grabbed the

339
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:03,754
gem and upon contact was bombarded with mystical
energies that destroyed the temple and buried

340
00:31:03,794 --> 00:31:09,302
Kain in the rubble. He emerged, transformed
with crimson armor, and seemingly limitless

341
00:31:09,342 --> 00:31:14,725
strength becoming the Juggernaut. With his mind
set on vengeance for the injustices of his

342
00:31:14,765 --> 00:31:20,869
past, Kane sought out his stepbrother Charles
who at this point had become Professor X, the

343
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:26,492
leader of the X-Men, which he formed to defend
his dream of peaceful, mutant, and human coexistence.

344
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:32,095
You can learn more about the X-Men in their
team duel against the Titans. Kane's new helmet

345
00:31:32,195 --> 00:31:36,877
protected him from Professor X's psychic attacks,
and the entire X-Men team was able to defeat

346
00:31:36,897 --> 00:31:41,987
him. were unable to stop his newfound might.
It took assistance from the Human Torch of

347
00:31:42,007 --> 00:31:47,130
the Fantastic Four to melt off Kane's helmet
so that Professor X could stop his stepbrother

348
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:52,592
by placing him into a coma. The Professor locked
Kane in the mansion's basement, where he attempted

349
00:31:52,612 --> 00:31:57,514
to remove the powers of the Juggernaut with
some assistance from Doctor Strange. Eventually,

350
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:03,456
Kane came out of his coma and attacked the X-Men
again, who used the Gem of Sidorak to send

351
00:32:03,516 --> 00:32:09,360
Kane to the deity's dimension known as the Crimson.
Cosmos. Kane eventually made his way back to

352
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:13,603
Earth's dimension and went on to battle other
heroes such as the Hulk, before meeting and

353
00:32:13,663 --> 00:32:19,108
forming a criminal partnership with a mutant
named Black Tom Cassidy, and soon the pair

354
00:32:19,128 --> 00:32:24,872
became the world's most wanted criminals. After
fighting Thor, the Norse God of Thunder, Kane

355
00:32:24,892 --> 00:32:30,697
found himself hurled into space, where he overthrew
a small planet and became its ruler. Black

356
00:32:30,737 --> 00:32:36,061
Tom Cassidy made a deal for access to a teleportation
machine, which he used to get Kane back to

357
00:32:36,181 --> 00:32:41,575
Earth. Upon his return, Kane searched for and
rediscovered his Crimson Gem of Sidorak to

358
00:32:41,615 --> 00:32:48,057
reclaim his power source, which mystically bonded
to his body. Not long after, the powerful psychic

359
00:32:48,137 --> 00:32:54,379
entity known as Onslaught emerged, a manifestation
of the combined psyches of Magneto and Professor

360
00:32:54,599 --> 00:33:00,380
X. Shocked to learn that Onslaught was partly
his stepbrother, Kane fought the entity, who

361
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:05,294
ripped the Crimson Gem from Kane's body and
trapped him inside of it. Kane eventually was

362
00:33:05,334 --> 00:33:11,258
able to free himself only by destroying a corrupt
aspect of Sidorak himself, a battle that would

363
00:33:11,318 --> 00:33:16,841
later strip him of most of his power. Humbled,
Kane finally reconciled with his stepbrother

364
00:33:16,881 --> 00:33:22,484
Professor X and joined the X-Men, coming to
understand the mutant plight despite not being

365
00:33:22,544 --> 00:33:27,787
a mutant himself. His old partner in crime,
Black Tom Cassidy, then formed a new Brotherhood

366
00:33:27,807 --> 00:33:32,770
of Mutants, which Kane joined as a double agent
for the X-Men, and later joined the British

367
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:37,773
mutant team known as Excalibur, which you can
learn more about in our Uncle Sam versus Captain

368
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:43,036
Britain duel. Kane was among the X-Men who tried
to protect Professor X from the Hulk's wrath,

369
00:33:43,336 --> 00:33:48,019
who had returned to Earth after being exiled
into space by a secret group of influential

370
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:54,703
heroes called the Illuminati. Still unable to
access the full power of Sidorak, Kane lost

371
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:59,970
his fight with the Hulk. However, Sidorak then
appeared before Kane to tell him that the Crimson

372
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:06,493
Gem was meant to be used for selfish, not heroic
purposes. Agreeing to the Deity's terms, Cain

373
00:34:06,513 --> 00:34:11,495
was restored to his full strength and once again
fought the Hulk, a battle which ended with

374
00:34:11,515 --> 00:34:17,057
the Hulk using Cain's momentum against him and
fleeing the encounter. Cain ended up abandoning

375
00:34:17,117 --> 00:34:23,280
Sidorak's power, instead choosing to wield the
Hammer of Kurth to become a member of the Worthy,

376
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:29,342
a group loyal to the Norse god of fear known
as the Serpent. Eventually, Thor defeated the

377
00:34:29,382 --> 00:34:35,925
serpent and Cain lost his hammer. Without the
blessing of Sidorak, he was now entirely powerless.

378
00:34:36,465 --> 00:34:42,628
Retiring to a farm in Utah, Cain tried to live
peacefully, but soon heard Sidorak's gem calling

379
00:34:42,828 --> 00:34:48,591
out to him as he started looking for a new champion
for the Mystic Deity. Cain heeded the call,

380
00:34:48,871 --> 00:34:53,493
but only to the gem first in order to destroy
it. He had to take on the power instead of

381
00:34:53,533 --> 00:34:58,427
eradicating it, however. to keep the gem's power
out of the hands of a villain known as the

382
00:34:58,507 --> 00:35:03,909
Living Monolith. Becoming Cidorak's champion
once again, Kain tried to collect a 20 million

383
00:35:03,949 --> 00:35:08,711
dollar bounty on Deadpool's head, though the
merc buried Juggernaut with a cement truck,

384
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:15,014
buying him enough time to escape. During a confrontation
with the former New Mutants member Magic, Kain

385
00:35:15,034 --> 00:35:19,736
was condemned to her nether realm of Limbo,
where he was cut off from Cidorak's power.

386
00:35:20,216 --> 00:35:24,586
Kain had to sacrifice his armor to get back
home. where he once again sought out the Crimson

387
00:35:24,626 --> 00:35:29,728
Gem and regained his abilities. You can learn
more about Magic in her duel episode against

388
00:35:29,848 --> 00:35:35,409
Deadman. Though Kane sought to become a citizen
of the mutant island nation of Krakoa, Professor

389
00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:41,291
X had to initially deny his stepbrothers request
since Kane was not a mutant. However, due to

390
00:35:41,331 --> 00:35:46,192
his history as a member of the X-Men, Krakoa's
leading council put Kane's citizenship up for

391
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:51,182
a vote, and he was able to join his former teammates
on the island. Kane became a member of one

392
00:35:51,222 --> 00:35:56,723
of Krakoa's defensive forces based out of a
pocket reality contained in Professor X's son

393
00:35:56,843 --> 00:36:02,765
Legion's psyche, a team known as the Legionaries.
You can learn more about Legion and Krakoa

394
00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:07,406
in their respective duels against Crazy Jane
and Danny the Street. And that's the Juggernaut's

395
00:36:07,426 --> 00:36:13,088
backstory. Powers-wise, Juggernaut is bonded
to the Crimson Bands of Cidorak, granting him

396
00:36:13,128 --> 00:36:18,549
immense levels of mystic power. This includes
vastly enhanced strength, able to lift in excess

397
00:36:18,589 --> 00:36:23,450
of 100 tons. He is fully invulnerable to damage
due to a mystic personal force field around

398
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:28,892
his body, which he can extend to increase his
area of protection. Juggernaut's personal inertia

399
00:36:28,992 --> 00:36:33,853
keeps him moving in any direction he chooses,
making him able to smash through any obstacle

400
00:36:34,273 --> 00:36:39,195
and rendering him virtually unstoppable. With
enough time and distance, Juggernaut can reach

401
00:36:39,255 --> 00:36:45,216
speeds approaching Mach 1. He is only susceptible
to high-level mental or magical attacks, and

402
00:36:45,276 --> 00:36:50,586
if he is ever injured, the powers of Sidorak
allow him to regeneratively heal. He also has

403
00:36:50,646 --> 00:36:56,671
military hand-to-hand combat training, and finally
with the bands, he is self-sustaining, having

404
00:36:56,811 --> 00:37:03,256
no need for food, water, or air. Hey, sounds
like a better version of Rhino. That's not

405
00:37:03,316 --> 00:37:09,381
a incorrect statement for sure. Yeah, they both
specialize basically in charging their enemies,

406
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:13,525
and I gotta tell you, there's no way that Atrocitus
is gonna stop the Juggernaut because you can't

407
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:19,714
stop this motherfucker. Holy shit balls. Is
what the Juggernaut is gonna be saying. when

408
00:37:19,734 --> 00:37:26,320
Atrocitus kicks his ass. Let me tell you all
about the Red Lantern Atrocitus. Now in DC

409
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:31,204
comics, the Guardians of the Universe are a
race of beings who are among the first intelligent

410
00:37:31,244 --> 00:37:37,670
beings in the universe. In order to bring order
and peace to the universe, the Guardians settled

411
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:43,435
on the planet Oa near the center of existence,
from which they directed a peacekeeping army

412
00:37:43,475 --> 00:37:49,775
of androids known as Manhunters. The Manhunter's
programming eventually became corrupted however,

413
00:37:50,095 --> 00:37:55,998
punishing beings over trivial matters and eventually
coming to the conclusion that because organic

414
00:37:56,078 --> 00:38:01,740
life could not be perfect, they would exterminate
all of it to achieve true order within the

415
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:08,042
universe. Out of 3,600 sectors in the universe
that the Manhunters were charged with protecting,

416
00:38:08,423 --> 00:38:16,018
they began their universal genocide in Sector
666, where a being named Altos watched as Furtah,

417
00:38:16,398 --> 00:38:21,740
daughter Atreca, and son Limey were murdered
by the androids. Although the Guardians were

418
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:27,703
able to decommission the Manhunters before more
sectors were entirely annihilated, Altos was

419
00:38:27,843 --> 00:38:33,846
one of only five beings in the entire sector
to survive the genocide. Together, they formed

420
00:38:33,926 --> 00:38:39,468
a terrorist cabal known as the Five Inversions
that was dedicated to destroying the Guardians

421
00:38:39,488 --> 00:38:46,392
from Oa and all that served them. With Altos,
now known as Atrocitus, as their leader, the

422
00:38:46,452 --> 00:38:52,955
Five Inversions performed an alien occult ritual
that allowed them to see into the future. Prophesying,

423
00:38:53,035 --> 00:38:58,498
among other things, the Blankest Night event
when Necron, the embodiment of death, would

424
00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:03,581
usher in the death of all life in the universe.
After setting up a home base on the planet

425
00:39:03,621 --> 00:39:09,585
Yismalt, the Five Inversions conquered three
entire galaxies, establishing a dominion known

426
00:39:09,645 --> 00:39:16,408
as the Empire of Tears, with magic and occultism
integrated into everyday life. Looking to quell

427
00:39:16,448 --> 00:39:22,392
the Inversion's terrorism and replace the Empire
of Tears' chaotic magic use with scientific

428
00:39:22,572 --> 00:39:28,455
order, the Guardians used their new universal
peacekeepers, the Green Lantern Corps, to overthrow

429
00:39:28,475 --> 00:39:33,638
the Empire and imprison the five Inversions
on Yosmalt. The five prisoners were periodically

430
00:39:33,678 --> 00:39:38,741
visited by the Green Lantern named Avan Sur,
who became obsessed with their prophecy of

431
00:39:38,761 --> 00:39:43,653
the Blackest Night. When Aben freed Atrocitus
in order to guide him to the source of the

432
00:39:43,713 --> 00:39:50,419
prophetic Black on Earth, Atrocitus escaped,
fatally injuring Aben and beginning a rampage

433
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:56,424
on Earth. After performing rituals to track
down William Hand, the one prophesied to herald

434
00:39:56,504 --> 00:40:02,209
the Blackest Knight, Atrocitus was attacked
and defeated by Sinestro and the rookie Green

435
00:40:02,249 --> 00:40:07,674
Lantern, Hal Jordan. Both of whom you can learn
more about in our Sinestro vs Magneto, and

436
00:40:07,714 --> 00:40:13,977
Green Lantern vs. Nova duel episodes. Sinistro
returned Atrocitus to Yismalt, where Atrocitus

437
00:40:14,057 --> 00:40:19,540
vowed revenge against Sinistro and prophesied
that Sinistro's home planet of Korugar would

438
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:25,023
fall into chaos. This prophecy eventually resulted
in Sinistro defecting from the Green Lantern

439
00:40:25,063 --> 00:40:30,587
Corps and starting his own Sinistro Corps, who
went to war with the Guardians. It was at this

440
00:40:30,627 --> 00:40:36,490
time that Atrocitus forged the first Red Lantern
power battery, powered by rage, in much the

441
00:40:36,510 --> 00:40:41,572
same way that Green Lanterns and Yellow Lanterns
were powered by Willpower and Fear, respectively.

442
00:40:42,052 --> 00:40:47,634
He killed the other four Inversions, using their
blood to create a Red Central Power Battery

443
00:40:47,774 --> 00:40:53,517
and Red Brains, which were sent to wrathful
beings across the universe, primarily those

444
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:58,739
who had been wronged by the Sinestro Corps,
including the former Green Lantern Lyra. The

445
00:40:58,819 --> 00:41:03,821
Red Lanterns ambushed the Green Lanterns after
they had defeated Sinestro, capturing him and

446
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:09,515
retreating to Yasmalt. There, Atrocitus had
Sinestro crucified to a red lantern symbol,

447
00:41:09,976 --> 00:41:15,638
attempting to use his blood to expand his new
red rings for his core, with the goal of destroying

448
00:41:15,678 --> 00:41:21,921
Kor'gar, the Sinestro core, and the Green Lantern
core. Before he could, however, Sinestro was

449
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:27,623
rescued by his core members alongside Hal Jordan
and a couple of blue lanterns in a massive

450
00:41:27,663 --> 00:41:33,326
battle on Yosmalt, forcing Atrocitus to retreat
to the dark side of the planet. where he performed

451
00:41:33,386 --> 00:41:39,211
a ritual to locate the Blue Lantern's homeworld,
as they too were now the subject of his wrath.

452
00:41:39,491 --> 00:41:44,935
During the Blackest Night event, Black Power
Rings arrived on Yosemalt and reanimated Lyra

453
00:41:45,015 --> 00:41:50,260
as well as the other foreign versions, one of
which ripped out Atrocitus' heart, though he

454
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:55,824
survived since Red Lantern Blood was pumped
by their red rings once they obtained them.

455
00:41:56,204 --> 00:42:01,979
Later on Akara, Atrocitus attempted to steal
the sole orange lantern Larkfleeza's power

456
00:42:01,999 --> 00:42:08,262
battery, but was thwarted by members of the
other colored core. Hal Jordan, Sinestro, the

457
00:42:08,282 --> 00:42:15,105
blue lantern Saint Walker, the violent lantern
Carol Ferris, as well as Indigo One. Atrocitus

458
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:20,407
was taken to the planet Riot, where he agreed
to help fight the Black Lanterns, despite vowing

459
00:42:20,447 --> 00:42:25,229
to kill the Guardians afterward. After tracking
the Black Lantern's central power battery to

460
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:30,665
Earth, the core leaders combined their lights
to form the white light of creation, who have

461
00:42:30,725 --> 00:42:36,809
failed to destroy the battery. During an attack
by a Black Lantern Spectre, Atrocitus sensed

462
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:42,133
its true nature as an entity of divine wrath
and attempted to capture him to use his rage

463
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:47,817
as a power source. His attempt failed, however,
and Atrocitus received a warning from the Spectre

464
00:42:48,138 --> 00:42:54,042
about the true rage entity of the emotional
spectrum, a being known as the Butcher. After

465
00:42:54,102 --> 00:42:58,606
Necron and the Black Lanterns were defeated,
Atrocitus returned to Earth and used the blood

466
00:42:58,626 --> 00:43:04,070
of several criminals to perform a ritual to
locate the emotional spectrum entities, including

467
00:43:04,170 --> 00:43:10,096
the Butcher, though his actions sparked a confrontation
with Hal, Carol, and Sinestro. Atrocitus had

468
00:43:10,136 --> 00:43:15,861
hired Lobo earlier to attack them, however,
in a ploy to gain the other's trust. His plan

469
00:43:15,921 --> 00:43:22,514
worked, and Atrocitus managed to locate the
Butcher, which, with reluctant he managed to

470
00:43:22,554 --> 00:43:27,755
imprison his power battery to use as an energy
source for his rings to create constructs.

471
00:43:28,195 --> 00:43:33,457
Though the Spectre tried to stop him, he found
himself unable as he realized Atrocitus' cause

472
00:43:33,717 --> 00:43:38,578
was a quote-unquote, Holy One. You can learn
more about the Spectre in his duel against

473
00:43:38,658 --> 00:43:44,020
Galactus. The Butcher was, however, eventually
freed from Atrocitus' lantern by the villain,

474
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:49,461
Corona, a former guardian of the universe who
was responsible for unleashing evil and chaos

475
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:55,466
on the world, near the beginning of time. After
using the Butcher to defeat Atrocitus and several

476
00:43:55,586 --> 00:44:01,090
other lanterns, Chrona retreated to the planet
Riot, and though Atrocitus and the others managed

477
00:44:01,191 --> 00:44:06,755
to track him there, they initially only found
the Book of Black, which revealed that it was

478
00:44:06,815 --> 00:44:12,720
Chrona all along who had corrupted the Manhunter's
programming. The lanterns became trapped within

479
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:20,278
the book, but were eventually freed by the Green
Lantern Kyle Raynor. of the opportunity to

480
00:44:20,358 --> 00:44:26,180
kill Krona in revenge, as Hal Jordan had done
it while Atrocitus was trapped, Krona's corpse

481
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:31,781
was delivered to Atrocitus on his smalt to do
with as he saw fit. With the ultimate cause

482
00:44:31,821 --> 00:44:38,443
for his rage avenged, Atrocitus feared losing
control over the Red Lanterns as his rage dimmed.

483
00:44:38,763 --> 00:44:44,445
Performing a blood ritual using Krona's innards,
Atrocitus made a new vow to punish the guilty

484
00:44:44,485 --> 00:44:50,216
across the universe to maintain order. and he
promoted one of his Red Lanterns, Bleese, to

485
00:44:50,236 --> 00:44:55,781
be his right hand, restoring her sanity as the
Red Lantern rings drive its bearers mad with

486
00:44:55,861 --> 00:45:02,626
rage. Bleese, however, almost immediately attempted
a revolt, and on top of that, Krona's corpse

487
00:45:02,687 --> 00:45:08,852
went missing, leading Atrocitus to fear that
Krona had resurrected somehow. In reality,

488
00:45:09,212 --> 00:45:15,517
a being named Abyssmas, which was one of Atrocitus'
early attempts at creating life through necromancy,

489
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:22,114
stole Krona's corpse and ate it, imbuing him
with great power. Although Atrocitus was injured

490
00:45:22,174 --> 00:45:27,958
in the battle against Abyssmas, he was saved
by Jon Mour, the new Red Lantern of Earth.

491
00:45:28,278 --> 00:45:32,401
When another Lantern of Earth, Kyle Raynor,
attempted to harness the power of the Seven

492
00:45:32,421 --> 00:45:38,985
Core, Atrocitus agreed to train Kyle in harnessing
rage and the use of a Red Lantern Ring. Shortly

493
00:45:39,105 --> 00:45:46,314
after, Atrocitus was confronted by a powerful
entity known as the First Lantern, an alternate

494
00:45:46,354 --> 00:45:52,375
reality in which his former self, Altos, did
not lose his family to the Manhunters, but

495
00:45:52,415 --> 00:45:58,117
instead rose to power as a wrathful dictator
within his sector, going so far as to killing

496
00:45:58,157 --> 00:46:03,979
his own wife and later being killed by his own
son. Atrocitus rejected this reality and joined

497
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:09,300
a campaign to destroy the first lantern with
the other core, which also resulted in him

498
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:15,219
and Sinestro killing the last of the Guardians
of the Universe. Stripped of his Red Ring by

499
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:20,743
the Green Lantern, Guy Gardner, who became the
new leader of the Red Lanterns, Atrocitus merged

500
00:46:20,763 --> 00:46:25,827
with the Butcher, but was stripped of the entity
by Kyle Raynor. After attempting to create

501
00:46:25,907 --> 00:46:31,291
hundreds more rings and ring bearers on Earth,
Guy Gardner destroyed all of the new rings,

502
00:46:31,651 --> 00:46:38,477
as well as Atrocitus, seemingly. Atrocitus emerged
later on, however, and regained leadership

503
00:46:38,597 --> 00:46:45,124
over the Red Lantern. with whom he began enacting
the prophecy of the Red Dawn on Earth, as the

504
00:46:45,204 --> 00:46:51,488
planet and its beings were the new source of
his rage. And that's Atrocitus so far. Powers-wise,

505
00:46:51,788 --> 00:46:57,631
the Red Lantern Atrocitus is an alien of the
planet Yismalt with greater longevity, physical

506
00:46:57,691 --> 00:47:03,454
strength, and durability than humans, as well
as having sharp claws on his hands. He is an

507
00:47:03,494 --> 00:47:10,226
accomplished necromancer and shaman of blood
magic, allowing him to see into the and create

508
00:47:10,326 --> 00:47:16,591
objects such as red lantern batteries and rings.
Upon bearing the red ring, Atrocitus' blood

509
00:47:16,631 --> 00:47:22,816
was replaced by a lava-like red plasma, so intent
it's capable of burning through and corroding

510
00:47:23,277 --> 00:47:28,921
other forms of energy. He can project this plasma
from his mouth or ring, and he is one of the

511
00:47:28,981 --> 00:47:34,446
few red lanterns capable of creating energy-based
constructs of anything he can imagine. He's

512
00:47:34,546 --> 00:47:40,090
also one of the few red lanterns in possession
of his full mental faculty, and and not consumed

513
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:45,495
by a debilitating sense of rage. And that's
Atrocitus. So it looks like another similarity

514
00:47:45,535 --> 00:47:49,958
between the two characters is that sometimes
they've occasionally flirted with the idea

515
00:47:49,978 --> 00:47:56,043
of being heroes. Uh, yeah, you could say that.
He's definitely teamed up with, you know, quote-unquote

516
00:47:56,163 --> 00:48:00,187
good Lantern Cores, kind of the same way that
the Juggernaut has teamed up with the X-Men.

517
00:48:00,567 --> 00:48:05,431
He's a misunderstood anti-hero, I guess you
could say. I would not describe Juggernaut

518
00:48:05,491 --> 00:48:10,427
as that. He's more of like a selfish dickhead
who sometimes gets wise. And Atrocitus is going

519
00:48:10,447 --> 00:48:14,530
to get wise during this matchup because he's
going to find out what happens when an unstoppable

520
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:19,795
force meets an immovable object. Is Atrocitus
the unstoppable force or the immovable object?

521
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:23,077
No, obviously Juggernaut is both. Okay.

522
00:48:30,478 --> 00:48:36,142

00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:13,405
where we settle the debate and settle the score.

530
00:49:17,738 --> 00:49:21,680
But now that we've got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

531
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:28,003
of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not this speculation,

532
00:49:28,343 --> 00:49:34,666
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could
play out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?

533
00:49:35,586 --> 00:49:39,588
Well, I should say there are no rules, other
than the characters have no prior knowledge

534
00:49:39,608 --> 00:49:43,994
of the other going into the fight. All they
are aware of starting out... is that the other

535
00:49:44,014 --> 00:49:49,117
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.
For the speculation, the contestants will begin

536
00:49:49,158 --> 00:49:54,221
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript
environment that will have no bearing on the

537
00:49:54,261 --> 00:49:59,605
match itself, as no environmental statistics
are considered in my simulations. The contestants

538
00:49:59,645 --> 00:50:04,728
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright
then let's get into it. Atrocitus and Juggernaut

539
00:50:04,988 --> 00:50:09,772
meet on the battlefield. Who goes first? I'm
going to say Atrocitus goes first, because

540
00:50:10,272 --> 00:50:17,075
he's just like really angry. way more angry
than Juggernaut. So he'll start off by aiming

541
00:50:17,095 --> 00:50:23,177
his ring at Juggernaut and just napalming the
guy with like a stream of hot plasma that's

542
00:50:23,217 --> 00:50:27,438
just gonna melt his armor off. No, Juggernaut's
force field is gonna stop that. It's not even

543
00:50:27,458 --> 00:50:32,399
gonna touch Juggernaut. And Juggernaut's gonna
be like, "'Don't you know who I am? "'I'm the

544
00:50:32,499 --> 00:50:38,861
Juggernaut, bitch.'" I had to say that. And
Juggernaut's gonna charge forward and he slams

545
00:50:39,021 --> 00:50:45,224
into Atrocitus, just turning him. into a red
smear. Quickest match ever. Okay, so let me

546
00:50:45,244 --> 00:50:52,189
get this straight. Human torch can melt his
armor, but atrocitas can't? No, I mean to clarify,

547
00:50:52,389 --> 00:50:57,772
the human torch melted the rivets that held
Juggernaut's helmet in place, not his armor,

548
00:50:58,292 --> 00:51:03,536
and that was like his first comic book appearance.
I mean like since then, he's grown more powerful

549
00:51:04,016 --> 00:51:10,667
and developed the force field thing. Okay, but
Atrocitus' plasma can destroy other forms of

550
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:16,028
energy, like forcefield energy. No, no, Juggernaut's
forcefield, it's not like just simple energy.

551
00:51:16,608 --> 00:51:23,690
It's magic energy sourced from one of the most
powerful elder mystic deities. Like Atrocitus

552
00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:28,972
is not more powerful than Sidorak, and like
neither are any of the lanterns for that matter.

553
00:51:29,412 --> 00:51:34,553
So I don't think Atrocitus' energy is actually
strong enough to burn through Juggernaut's

554
00:51:34,613 --> 00:51:40,416
forcefield. Okay, fine. Atrocitus gets slammed
into but you know, he's not a smear because

555
00:51:40,516 --> 00:51:45,498
he threw up a wall construct at the last second
So what juggernaut plows right through the

556
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:50,982
wall and he's this unstoppable force now, right?
No, but like Atrocitus was knocked out of the

557
00:51:51,022 --> 00:51:56,925
way of the juggernaut by the wall debris is
what I'm saying And you know Atrocitus he's

558
00:51:56,945 --> 00:52:02,448
an accomplished shaman and he's probably gonna
recognize The mystic nature of juggernaut's

559
00:52:02,508 --> 00:52:07,855
powers by this point. So while juggernaut you
know, continues to charge in the same direction,

560
00:52:08,395 --> 00:52:14,737
Atrocitus is just gonna vomit plasma blood on
the floor in a circle around him. What is it?

561
00:52:14,757 --> 00:52:21,440
What does the circle of plasma blood do? You're
gonna find out. You're gonna learn today. Okay.

562
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:27,503
Well Juggernaut, meanwhile, he's gonna make
a long ass U-turn and he's gonna double back

563
00:52:27,843 --> 00:52:32,325
to charge Atrocitus again. But this time, you
know, he's built up enough speed so he's going

564
00:52:32,345 --> 00:52:37,927
like 200 miles per hour. And like, for sure
when he plows it to Atrocitus, he's gonna turn

565
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:42,689
him into a skid mark. Except that like in the
time it takes for Juggernaut to do this long

566
00:52:42,789 --> 00:52:50,292
ass U-turn, Atrocitus used his blood to create
a blood magic sigil around him. And when Juggernaut

567
00:52:50,432 --> 00:52:57,335
steps into that sigil, he gets frozen in place.
You virtually can't stop him though. Like there's

568
00:52:57,415 --> 00:53:02,837
also a mystic force powering Juggernaut's inertia.
So you're just talking about magic versus magic.

569
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:09,274
Okay, okay, well, let's say instead of freezing
him in place, the blood sigil just makes him

570
00:53:09,434 --> 00:53:14,958
run in place like a like a frictionless surface
or like a hamster wheel. Interesting. I'll

571
00:53:14,978 --> 00:53:22,943
allow it. And from the sigil, Atrocitus is then
going to channel a tornado made of pure blood

572
00:53:23,224 --> 00:53:28,447
that just lifts Juggernaut into the air. And
now that he's in the air and can't like run

573
00:53:28,487 --> 00:53:33,951
or charge or do fucking anything that he can
do. Atrocitus is going to create this giant

574
00:53:34,051 --> 00:53:39,776
mace that he's going to swing in the air and
knock Juggernaut to the horizon. No, but like,

575
00:53:40,136 --> 00:53:47,022
so a force generated against Juggernaut is the
same thing as Juggernaut directing a force

576
00:53:47,102 --> 00:53:53,307
against the object. So basically Juggernaut
is just going to no sell being hit by this

577
00:53:53,347 --> 00:53:58,631
red energy mace. It's just going to shatter
around him as he's like running midair being

578
00:53:58,672 --> 00:54:03,995
lifted up by this blood tornado. And then. Juggernaut's
gonna clap his hands, which is gonna be like

579
00:54:04,015 --> 00:54:10,057
this massive thunder clap that generates a gust
of wind that's gonna dissipate Atrocitus' blood

580
00:54:10,077 --> 00:54:15,319
tornado. And Juggernaut's gonna fall to the
ground, you know, outside of the blood sigil,

581
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:21,462
and he's gonna stomp the ground, which is gonna
kick up this massive ass boulder that he catches

582
00:54:21,822 --> 00:54:27,585
and just hurls at Atrocitus, just smashing into
him. Except that this boulder is caught midair

583
00:54:28,045 --> 00:54:34,786
by like a giant... set of claws like talons.
It's an energy construct that just crushes

584
00:54:34,826 --> 00:54:40,190
the boulder in its grasp before moving over
to Juggernaut and gripping him by his helmet

585
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:46,415
like a crane game and bringing him over to Atrocitus
who uses the claws to pry off the Juggernaut's

586
00:54:46,435 --> 00:54:52,700
helmet, at which point he's going to carve a
symbol into Juggernaut's forehead that allows

587
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:58,264
Atrocitus to take control of him, like mentally.
And that's one of the Juggernauts just going

588
00:54:58,285 --> 00:55:04,760
to punch his own head off. and end this match.
Well, okay, if the Talons pick up and bring

589
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:12,024
Juggernaut over to Atrocitus, then they're generating
inertia for Juggernaut in Atrocitus's direction,

590
00:55:12,144 --> 00:55:17,107
right? So like, Atrocitus doesn't have any time
to pry off Juggernaut's helmet or carve anything

591
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:22,270
into his head because Juggernaut's just gonna
keep fucking flying toward Atrocitus, you know,

592
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:28,613
fist first, and he's just gonna punch off Atrocitus's
head clean off instead of his own. Hey, hey,

593
00:55:28,673 --> 00:55:35,021
you can't. You can't do that thing. I did the
head thing. I say Juggernaut misses and punches

594
00:55:35,061 --> 00:55:42,545
Atrocitus through the chest. And surprise, Atrocitus
doesn't even need a heart to live. Well, he

595
00:55:42,585 --> 00:55:45,606
probably has other organs in his chest, right?
Like lungs or something like that. Does he

596
00:55:45,646 --> 00:55:50,429
need lungs to breathe? Because those are gone,
too, with this hole in his chest. He's an alien.

597
00:55:50,449 --> 00:55:56,472
Like, you don't know where his lungs are. All
right. Well, then Juggernaut turns Atrocitus

598
00:55:56,512 --> 00:55:59,831
around and then rips out his ass lungs. OK.
Same thing.

599
00:56:05,122 --> 00:56:11,043
The disrespect, no way Atrocitus is gonna let
this happen to him. He would just get so pissed

600
00:56:11,143 --> 00:56:18,305
off. He's already full of rage and he saw this
coming. So it didn't happen because he divined

601
00:56:18,365 --> 00:56:24,067
the future before this match and saw Juggernaut
would try shit like that. And so it doesn't

602
00:56:24,107 --> 00:56:28,728
work. Like Juggernaut just ends up under his
control. End of match that never happened.

603
00:56:28,748 --> 00:56:33,929
All right, we'll go ahead and leave it there.
Either Atrocitus manages to pry off Juggernaut's

604
00:56:33,969 --> 00:56:38,652
helmet. and carve a magic symbol in his forehead
that makes him take over Juggernaut's mind

605
00:56:39,152 --> 00:56:45,616
and cause him to punch his head off. Or Juggernaut
rips out Atrocities' heart and or butt lungs.

606
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:53,660
Well it's not the heart. I hate to say it's
the butt lungs. We'll just say internal organs.

607
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:57,422
We'll just go with that. Okay. There we go.
We'll go ahead and leave the match there. We're

608
00:56:57,442 --> 00:57:01,144
going to input the character's stats, run a
thousand simulations, and come back with a

609
00:57:01,164 --> 00:57:08,826
winner. AJ9K, hit it! inputting data, running
calculations, processing results, simulations

610
00:57:08,846 --> 00:57:14,951
complete. All right, this is a pretty interesting
match up. The characters were semi-similar

611
00:57:14,971 --> 00:57:20,796
in terms of their stats, although we did give
the edge in things like durability and strength,

612
00:57:21,216 --> 00:57:26,381
obviously, to Juggernaut. Yeah, there was no
surprise there. Also no surprise we gave the

613
00:57:26,521 --> 00:57:33,743
edge in terms of versatility, range, and evasiveness
to Atrocitus because Juggernaut never evades.

614
00:57:34,283 --> 00:57:39,888
Yeah, that's true. We also gave the speed advantage
to Atrocitus because Juggernaut really has

615
00:57:39,928 --> 00:57:45,052
to accelerate to those high speeds that he can
run at. Whereas Atrocitus, you know, he's damn

616
00:57:45,092 --> 00:57:51,037
fast. We gave a slight fighting edge to Juggernaut
considering that he has a lot of experience

617
00:57:51,177 --> 00:57:57,958
as a brawler and also has some military combat
training. Whereas Atrocitus was a... whereas

618
00:57:58,018 --> 00:58:03,903
Atrocitus was a psychologist prior to joining
the five inversions. And we all know that psychologists

619
00:58:03,943 --> 00:58:08,387
don't know how to fight. I'm just saying like
he doesn't have much fight training. He's very

620
00:58:08,427 --> 00:58:13,952
much a brawler, but I don't know how formal
that is. Of course this means that Atrocitus'

621
00:58:13,972 --> 00:58:18,276
background gives him the edge in intelligence.
We also said that he had the edge in perception,

622
00:58:18,456 --> 00:58:22,860
being that he can divine the future. So taking
all these stats into account, Jonathan, who

623
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,727
do you think is going to take home the dub?
I'm pretty sure it's gonna be atrocities. They

624
00:58:27,767 --> 00:58:32,591
were almost tit-for-tat when it came to the
different stats But I feel like the stats were

625
00:58:32,631 --> 00:58:38,295
atrocities came out ahead in he came out far
ahead in and I think most people would agree

626
00:58:38,575 --> 00:58:44,899
Our Instagram followers in the poll that we
did voted 73% in favor of Atrocities winning

627
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:50,183
which surprised me not gonna lie. I mean, it's
the motherfucking juggernaut. You can't stop

628
00:58:50,203 --> 00:58:55,146
him I don't see how you can vote against him,
but let's see if they're right AG9K the results

629
00:58:55,186 --> 00:59:06,354
please. Here you are sir. Alright the winner
between Atrocitus and Juggernaut is... Atrocitus.

630
00:59:06,934 --> 00:59:13,099
Of course it is! Of course it is! I guess you
can stop this motherfucker cause Atrocitus

631
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:19,303
laid the beat down on Juggernaut winning 827
of the simulated matches over Juggernaut's

632
00:59:19,463 --> 00:59:27,747
measly 173 wins. Shit yeah, eighty two point
seven percent over seventeen point three percent

633
00:59:27,787 --> 00:59:32,708
is no joke Juggernaut just didn't have you know
a lot of the stuff that atrocities excelled

634
00:59:32,788 --> 00:59:39,451
in like range versatility and speed Durability
and strength alone weren't able to help him

635
00:59:39,511 --> 00:59:46,073
overcome. I mean really statistically juggernaut
is not that Impressive of a specimen. He's

636
00:59:46,113 --> 00:59:52,127
kind of a one-trick pony in that You know, he
smashes things and he punches things and he

637
00:59:52,167 --> 00:59:56,930
does that stuff really well, but there's not
much more he can do. Yeah, he's sort of like

638
00:59:56,950 --> 01:00:01,392
the ultimate when it comes to like smashing
and punching things, right? Yeah. But yeah,

639
01:00:01,412 --> 01:00:07,095
it definitely didn't help him when it came up
against a character as versatile as a lantern.

640
01:00:07,556 --> 01:00:13,179
So does that mean that this was a mismatch?
Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, I liked the idea

641
01:00:13,219 --> 01:00:17,521
of it at the time, because, you know, again,
all the different correlations that we found

642
01:00:17,561 --> 01:00:24,427
between them. regards to like red energy and
they're just both angry thematically the match

643
01:00:24,467 --> 01:00:30,592
works but statistically it could have been worse
almost and we definitely can't blame the executive

644
01:00:30,612 --> 01:00:36,857
producers on this one because it was my idea
for a matchup i perhaps overestimated the juggernaut's

645
01:00:36,877 --> 01:00:42,342
ability to go up against red lantern so that's
my bad and once again you underestimate the

646
01:00:42,502 --> 01:00:49,532
awesomeness of dc and now you're learning your
lesson I definitely overestimate the cheater-ness,

647
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:55,235
the overpowered-ness of DC quite often. I tend
not to think that the characters are as bullshit

648
01:00:55,255 --> 01:00:59,858
as they are, but apparently I'm wrong. It's
a fucking lantern character! How did you not

649
01:00:59,899 --> 01:01:07,043
see this coming? Because it's the fucking juggernaut,
bitch! That's why. Pride, that's what it is.

650
01:01:07,324 --> 01:01:12,087
You're too proud of your Marvel characters.
Well, pride cometh before the fall, and now

651
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:17,982
you know. Well, my fist cometh before your fall.
Next time I see you. simply because I'm mad

652
01:01:18,002 --> 01:01:22,885
about this match. So yeah, next time I see you
in person, Jonathan, just be ready. You're

653
01:01:22,905 --> 01:01:27,708
gonna get punched. Okay, and like atrocities,
before you even reach me, I'm just gonna vomit

654
01:01:27,768 --> 01:01:28,368
all over you.

655
01:01:31,430 --> 01:01:37,993
That's gross. So have fun. Come at me. Well,

final film in the 10 film Tomorrowverse series.

663
01:02:22,401 --> 01:02:25,783
I'm gonna say right now I don't think you can
match the conclusion that was Justice League

664
01:02:25,803 --> 01:02:31,647
Dark Apocalypse War, but I'm hoping that Part
3 is at least better than Part 2. Yeah, same,

665
01:02:31,867 --> 01:02:35,829
same. But that does it for this episode, we
