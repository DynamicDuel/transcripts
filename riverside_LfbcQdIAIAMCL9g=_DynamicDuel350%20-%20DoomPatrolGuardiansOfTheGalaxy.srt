00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,012
Welcome to the dynamic duel podcast a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:30,032 --> 00:00:35,695
the superiority between Marvel and DC By comparing
their characters and stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:36,196 --> 00:00:45,301
I'm marvelous Joe and I'm his twin brother Johnny
DC and this is our 350th episode of this podcast

5
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:50,704
Jonathan did you ever think we'd make it this
far if you told me when we first started this

6
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:55,859
podcast That we would have had like a hundred
and seventy five matchups that we could come

7
00:00:55,919 --> 00:01:01,283
up with and 175 media content that we could
review. I would have said, there's no way you're

8
00:01:01,323 --> 00:01:07,008
out of your mind. I would have told you to get
the hell out of my house. Although you're not

9
00:01:07,048 --> 00:01:14,534
counting the Brothers Awards episodes and like
the San Diego Comic-Con episodes. True. But

10
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:19,498
yeah, we've been doing this for a long ass time,
but the show is still a blast to do. And this

11
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:23,181
episode is going to be a blast. We're going
to find out who'd win in a fight between the

12
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:30,059
teams of Doom Patrol and the Guardians of the
Galaxy. They're the misfit teams, as it were.

13
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,902
We're gonna put the misfits against each other.
Things are probably gonna get weird because

14
00:01:33,942 --> 00:01:37,726
things do get pretty weird with these teams
and we'll see which one comes out on top. This

15
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:42,891
will be the ninth team duel that we've done
so far on this show and in fact the fifth that

16
00:01:43,031 --> 00:01:47,194
Marvel will have won. Oh, you seem really confident
there. Yeah man, it's the Guardians. Not only

17
00:01:47,254 --> 00:01:51,214
are they gonna kick ass, they're gonna do it
with attitude. It's gonna be awesome. Before

18
00:01:51,234 --> 00:01:54,655
that, we're going to break down the comic book
movie news that came out this past week, of

19
00:01:54,675 --> 00:02:00,278
which we finally, finally got the first trailer
for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. We also got

20
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:06,801
a trailer for Kite Man, Hell Yeah, which will
be an animated series appearing on Max. It's

21
00:02:06,861 --> 00:02:11,663
a spinoff of the Harley Quinn animated series.
Right, as always, we list our segment times

22
00:02:11,683 --> 00:02:15,145
in our episode description, so feel free to
check out the show notes if you want to skip

23
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:20,184
ahead to a particular topic. As our listeners
may know, our dual simulator is so advanced

24
00:02:20,284 --> 00:02:24,627
that it's gained sentience and has named itself
the Artificial Lifeform for running extensive

25
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:31,772
duels, just a rather very intelligent simulator
9000, or Alfred Jarvis 9000. He has a quick

26
00:02:31,812 --> 00:02:38,419

pronounce this? Ryu no Suke? Aku Tagawa? from

44
00:04:11,858 --> 00:04:18,759
Bungo Stray Dogs and Gaara from Naruto. Please,
nobody message us about how I'm pronouncing

45
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:23,641
these because I don't know what I'm saying.
But they're cool anime characters from Stray

But with that out of the way, quick to the

48
00:04:36,144 --> 00:04:43,170
no prize. A no prize is an award Marvel used
to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic

49
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:48,514
Dual Note Prize, is a digital award that we
post on Instagram and in our email newsletter

50
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:53,877
for the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week's question

51
00:04:53,937 --> 00:04:59,621
was, what is your favorite non-video game from
Marvel or DC and why? We were looking for your

52
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:05,585
top table top games. And we got a hell of a
lot of answers for this one. A lot of great

53
00:05:05,665 --> 00:05:10,512
answers. It's pretty much impossible to pick
honorable mentions and winners for this. If

54
00:05:10,532 --> 00:05:15,055
you're a patron of the show, be sure to hop
on Discord where we'll be posting all of the

55
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:20,919
audio for these answers onto our Discord server.
But the first honorable mention goes to Lizzie

56
00:05:20,939 --> 00:05:26,923
Dyer Arnie, who said, Hey, it's Lizzie. My favorite
analog DC game is the DC deck building game.

57
00:05:27,403 --> 00:05:31,166
So this game, you get to choose your favorite
character. There's a million expansion packs,

58
00:05:31,186 --> 00:05:35,789
so you can pretty much be anyone you want. You
keep buying more cards, building your deck

59
00:05:35,809 --> 00:05:40,367
to defeat the villains. Some of the cards have
different powers. This is a really fun game

60
00:05:40,387 --> 00:05:46,049
to play and I highly recommend it. Yeah, I own
this game. It's a really fun game and there

61
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:52,332
are a ton of expansions based on like different
teams and storylines from the DC Comics universe.

62
00:05:52,672 --> 00:05:57,394
It's really fun to play. I love deck building
games. As you guys already know, Joseph and

63
00:05:57,494 --> 00:06:03,416
I created our own deck building game using Marvel
and DC characters, but we're also selling a

64
00:06:03,576 --> 00:06:10,132
robots version of that. Add aside. The DC deck
building game is a whole lot of fun. I love

65
00:06:10,152 --> 00:06:14,694
the DC deck building game. I remember you introduced
that to me like a little over a decade ago

66
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:18,997
and I immediately had to go on the internet
to see if there was a Marvel version of that

67
00:06:19,037 --> 00:06:24,240
game. And sure enough, right around that time
Marvel Legendary was introduced, which is the

68
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:29,222
Marvel deck building game that has a few more
components to it. It comes with a board and

69
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:33,385
different scenarios and everything. Both games
are a lot of fun though, for sure. Yeah, I

70
00:06:33,445 --> 00:06:39,834
highly recommend them. Next honorable mention
goes to Adam Spears, who said, Hey guys, it's

71
00:06:39,914 --> 00:06:45,838
Adam Spears. And I want to say that the best
card game out there is Munchkin. It's absolutely

72
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:51,663
fantastic for Marvel or DC fans. There is a
Batman expansion pack, but what I have played

73
00:06:51,703 --> 00:06:57,368
with my brother on is we've merged the Marvel
X-Men and Deadpool packs all together and we

74
00:06:57,388 --> 00:07:02,372
have a fantastic time with it. Munchkin is just
a funny, competitive and combative game. And

75
00:07:02,432 --> 00:07:06,902
I guarantee you, you're going to have a good
time with it. Oh, and check out the blast from

76
00:07:06,922 --> 00:07:11,364
our past podcast. Yeah, definitely check out
the Spears brothers blast from our past podcast.

77
00:07:11,644 --> 00:07:16,667
It's good times. A lot of fun, a lot of nostalgia.
Yeah, they put out a top 10. I think it was

78
00:07:16,687 --> 00:07:21,789
either board games in general or card games
episode. But they mentioned Munchkin on that

79
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:25,711
episode and they both ranked it fairly high
on their lists, which is all the recommendation

80
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:31,534
I need. Munchkin is a dungeon crawler style
board game. And in the Marvel version. You

81
00:07:31,554 --> 00:07:36,455
roleplay as a shield agent and you have your
level and you add your bonuses to it in order

82
00:07:36,495 --> 00:07:42,016
to fight the villains and gain their bonuses
if you manage to defeat them. Sounds like a

83
00:07:42,056 --> 00:07:47,478
lot of fun. I haven't played it myself, but
with such high recommendations, I know that

84
00:07:47,578 --> 00:07:52,439
I need to do that. And I didn't realize that
you could merge different expansions into one

85
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:58,501
game set. That's really cool. That is really
cool. Our final honorable mention goes to Unworthy

86
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:05,197
Collector, who said Hey guys, it's Unworthy
Collector. My favorite game that is not a video

87
00:08:05,257 --> 00:08:11,421
game from DC or Marvel would have to be from
the best Batman movie ever, Batman Forever.

88
00:08:11,902 --> 00:08:17,486
And the game was called Battle at the Big Top
and was a 3D board game. You really ought to

89
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:22,690
look it up. You had to roll the dice and flip
over the audience and shoot balls through hoops.

90
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:29,030
It was a great game. Yeah guys, check out Unworthy
Collector on Instagram and YouTube. And I really

91
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,873
appreciate this answer because it was a pretty
good deep dive. Oh yeah, I didn't even know

92
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:38,116
it existed. But just looking at photos of it
online, it almost looks like Mouse Trap, but

93
00:08:38,136 --> 00:08:43,220
with a Batman Forever theme. That's really cool.
I loved Mouse Trap as a kid, but this game

94
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,524
sounds even zanier, like shooting balls through
hoops and stuff. I like board games that don't

95
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:52,727
necessarily feel like your standard board game.
And this one sounds almost like a miniature

96
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:56,549
carnival game or something like that. Yeah,
thanks for your answer, unworthy collector.

97
00:08:57,138 --> 00:09:03,482
And also thanks to John Storosky, Christopher
Manotti, Peter Troll, and Louis DiArco for

98
00:09:03,522 --> 00:09:08,465
their answers. They had some great ones. I'll
just run them down. They mentioned Cards Against

99
00:09:08,545 --> 00:09:13,328
Marvel, the Batman the Animated Series board
game, Marvel Champions the card game, and Five

100
00:09:13,368 --> 00:09:17,491
Minute Marvel, which I've seen that at Target.
I've been wanting to check that one out specifically.

101
00:09:17,972 --> 00:09:23,976
But the winner of this week's No Prize is Colby
Hentges, who said, Hey boys, Colby Hentges.

102
00:09:24,296 --> 00:09:29,420
The best tabletop comic game is Hero Click.
They have Marvel hero clicks, they have DC

103
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:34,004
hero clicks, they had Indie hero clicks, they
had Horror hero clicks, you could have Aliens

104
00:09:34,024 --> 00:09:40,249
and Predator, Invincible, Hellboy, Iron Man,
Batman, they had everybody. And they played

105
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:44,372
really well together. They could all be on the
same team fighting Galactus, or they could

106
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:48,916
all be on separate teams fighting each other.
It was a great game, a little pricey for the

107
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:53,859
quality of minis you got, but I liked it. Yeah,
Colby Hentges gets the win this week because

108
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:57,961
Jonathan and I place a lot of nostalgic value
on Hero Clicks. We played the heck out of that

109
00:09:58,001 --> 00:10:03,665
game back when it came out in the early 2000s,
and you could buy both Marvel and DC figurines.

110
00:10:03,845 --> 00:10:08,467
And that's what Jonathan and I did, and we would
have our own Marvel versus DC battles using

111
00:10:08,507 --> 00:10:14,731
those miniatures. Yeah, Hero Clicks was absolutely
the easiest way to get into miniature gaming

112
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:20,058
because of the dial, the ingenious dial it had
on the stand that held the figurine. that you

113
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:25,220
would rotate and click the dial, depending on
how your health was affected, either by healing

114
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:30,102
or taking damage. And it changed your stats.
So you could see how it definitely inspired

115
00:10:30,202 --> 00:10:35,604
even this podcast. Oh yeah, Jonathan and I,
we kind of homebrewed our version of Hero Clicks

116
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:40,627
to give our characters powers that we thought
they should have, that they didn't necessarily

117
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:44,849
have. It was a lot of fun going through the
maps, fighting against each other, working

118
00:10:44,869 --> 00:10:49,950
with the stats. Just a great time overall. And
the figurines, you're right, they were not

119
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:54,712
great quality for the price, but we got a lot
of use out of them. We even made our own chess

120
00:10:54,732 --> 00:10:59,173
sets with our figurines. And I loved how, like
when people were watching us play chess, they

121
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:03,574
would be like, Oh, well, how do you know which
piece is which? And it's like, obviously Superman's

122
00:11:03,614 --> 00:11:11,556
the king. Obviously Batman's a knight. Obviously
Aquaman's a bishop. Come on. But congrats again

123
00:11:11,576 --> 00:11:15,017
to Colby Hentges for winning this week's No
Prize. If you, the listener, won a shot at

124
00:11:15,057 --> 00:11:19,337
winning your own No Prize. Stay tuned to later
on this episode when we'll be asking another

125
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:23,221
question of the week. And now that that's done,
on to the news!

126
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:34,571
Okay, so Aquaman is scheduled to be released
December 20th. So we've been waiting for a

127
00:11:34,651 --> 00:11:39,572
trailer for this for a while now, for a few
months, because usually they'll at least release

128
00:11:39,592 --> 00:11:46,074
a trailer maybe six months up to a year before
the movie's actual release date. But nothing

129
00:11:46,174 --> 00:11:51,116
until last week, which actually sets a record
in the amount of time between DC releasing

130
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:57,877
a trailer for a DCEU film and the actual release
date. But I gotta say, this was worth the wait.

131
00:11:58,378 --> 00:12:04,139
Like this trailer, James Wan's cinematography,
it looks so breathtaking. Like I was ready

132
00:12:04,179 --> 00:12:09,961
to write this film off because I'm still kind
of disheartened by them releasing these movies

133
00:12:10,221 --> 00:12:15,122
that really aren't leading anywhere. You know,
it's like a dead end since James Gunn is rebooting

134
00:12:15,142 --> 00:12:20,924
the universe soon. I was kind of just hoping
that they would release this film on Max, but

135
00:12:20,944 --> 00:12:25,645
I got to say this definitely looks like I want
to see it in theaters on the biggest screen

136
00:12:25,685 --> 00:12:31,065
possible. I agree, actually I liked the first
Aquaman movie, if you guys remember from our

137
00:12:31,105 --> 00:12:37,731
review of it, and like you I think I was ready
to kind of write this film off because there

138
00:12:37,851 --> 00:12:42,215
are lots of reports of test screenings that
didn't go too well from the film, but from

139
00:12:42,255 --> 00:12:47,419
what I could tell here, judging by this trailer,
this movie looks like a fucking great time.

140
00:12:47,859 --> 00:12:51,963
I don't know what those test screening people
saw, it could be that this is just the best

141
00:12:52,003 --> 00:12:57,906
trailer for the worst movie, but it really impressed
me. So I do have a theory regarding that. Early

142
00:12:57,926 --> 00:13:03,928
in the trailer, we get shots of Aquaman and
his baby that he and Mera had, Arthur Curry

143
00:13:03,968 --> 00:13:10,830
Jr., I'm supposing. The baby is super cute.
But if you read the comics, you know that Arthur

144
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:16,551
Curry Jr. suffers the tragic fate of dying at
the hands of Black Manta. I'm guessing this

145
00:13:16,611 --> 00:13:22,433
film received poor test screenings because they
were probably true to the comics and the baby

146
00:13:22,473 --> 00:13:27,075
died and people just kind of hated that. That's
my theory. I don't actually know if they're

147
00:13:27,095 --> 00:13:31,657
going to do that for the movie or if they changed
it or what's going to happen. But I do have

148
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:36,660
to say I would be really sad to see that baby
die because that's a cute baby is a cute baby

149
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:43,404
for sure. Don't kill Aqua baby Warner Brothers.
Come on. I'm torn. I'm like, do you stay true

150
00:13:43,424 --> 00:13:48,607
to the comics or do you like keep a fun movie
fun? Because it looks like it's going to be

151
00:13:48,767 --> 00:13:54,574
super fun and even borderline comedic, which
I guess is in the same tone. as the first movie.

152
00:13:54,594 --> 00:13:58,676
That also looks like it's going to be just as
visually breathtaking as the first movie as

153
00:13:58,736 --> 00:14:03,378
well. That was one of the major takeaways from
our review for that first film was just how

154
00:14:03,498 --> 00:14:08,140
good it looked. The cinematography, as I mentioned,
is breathtaking. I mean, there's a lot of,

155
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:14,643
you know, obvious visual effects going on, but
the world building and just like the vibrancy

156
00:14:14,743 --> 00:14:19,705
of the special effects really do a great job
of capturing the eye. Oh, yeah, the world building

157
00:14:19,725 --> 00:14:26,585
with like the jellyfish lanterns. going across
the city and even the train that Aquaman has

158
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:30,668
to stop early in the trailer. That's a very
Superman-esque moment. It's kind of cool to

159
00:14:30,748 --> 00:14:36,172
see him in that role. He's like the underwater
Superman, which I think is a perfect description

160
00:14:36,212 --> 00:14:40,835
of the character and a great way to portray
him. We see that there's a threat that's about

161
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:46,099
to befall the planet and it looks like Aquaman
is going to need the help of his brother, who

162
00:14:46,119 --> 00:14:50,638
was the villain in the first movie, Ocean Master
or Oram. It looks like they're going to team

163
00:14:50,658 --> 00:14:56,983
up in this movie to take on Black Manta, who
is wielding the Black Trident, which looks

164
00:14:57,483 --> 00:15:02,326
super cool, like the green flames and everything.
Oh man. Like just when you thought that Black

165
00:15:02,386 --> 00:15:07,450
Manta cannot look any cooler, they found a way.
For sure. Yeah. Black Manta looks badass in

166
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:12,593
this film. How do you feel about the premise
of Aquaman and Ocean Master teaming up for

167
00:15:12,613 --> 00:15:19,470
a fight? Is there precedence for that in the
comics? Yeah, actually in the new 52, Orm was

168
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:25,933
not depicted as villainous as he had been prior
to the New 52. Like he was very much willing

169
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:31,397
to abdicate the throne to his brother once he
found out that he was alive and that he existed.

170
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:37,000
So I think it's kind of in keeping with the
more recent comics that Ocean Master really

171
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:42,303
does have Atlantis' best intentions at heart,
most of the time. And it definitely looks like

172
00:15:42,363 --> 00:15:47,886
Black Manta is going to pose enough of a threat
to warrant the two brothers teaming up. Because

173
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:53,267
it almost looks like the Black Trident gave
some access to this undead underwater zombie

174
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:58,308
army, which is like right in keeping with James
Wan's horror background. Yeah, it seems very

175
00:15:58,508 --> 00:16:02,309
Game of Thrones in that regard, but you know,
much more fantastical and colorful. There's

176
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:06,851
a little bit of Lord of the Rings elements there
too, when you see the original Atlantean King

177
00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:11,052
going up against that Sauron looking guy with
the Black Trident in that flashback battle.

178
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:15,913
A lot of great stuff here. Oh yeah, and I described
the first movie as the closest thing that a

179
00:16:15,973 --> 00:16:20,718
superhero film has come. to Lord of the Rings,
but of course this was before Endgame and that

180
00:16:20,758 --> 00:16:25,700
big final end battle. One thing that James Wan
has been saying about this film in regards

181
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,461
to the two brothers teaming up is that from
the very beginning when he started working

182
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:36,223
on the first Aquaman movie, he pitched the sequel
as a bromance of sorts. Like the first movie

183
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:41,224
revolved around Aquaman and Mera, but the second
film I guess was always intended, according

184
00:16:41,244 --> 00:16:47,438
to James Wan, to revolve around Arthur and Orm.
So I'm excited to see how all of this leads

185
00:16:47,498 --> 00:16:52,340
up to a battle between Black Manta and his undead
army. It looks like it's gonna be really good

186
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,361
times, and I honestly can't wait for Christmas,
because this movie looks like it's gonna be

187
00:16:57,381 --> 00:17:02,703
incredible. I agree. I'm looking forward to
it. I hope it is the proper sendoff that the

188
00:17:02,743 --> 00:17:08,224
DCEU deserves, and it ends with a bang, not
a whimper. For sure. I hope there's no cameos.

189
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:13,860
Like, just let this thing stand on its own.
Just let the DCEU die. try not to lead into

190
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,530
anything else. That's my hope. But I guess we'll
find out this December. But this brings us

191
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,772
to our question of the week.

192
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:30,727

199
00:17:56,124 --> 00:18:03,789
before September 23rd. Now on the television
side of things, Max released its first teaser

200
00:18:03,829 --> 00:18:10,354
trailer for the animated series, Kite Man Hell
Yeah. It's of course a spin-off of the Harley

201
00:18:10,374 --> 00:18:16,018
Quinn animated series, which featured Kite Man
as a character for the past three seasons.

202
00:18:16,338 --> 00:18:19,820
Kite Man was definitely a standout character
on that show. So when I first heard that he

203
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:26,107
was getting his own spin-off series, I was pretty
excited. I mean, yeah, Kite Man was hilarious.

204
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:31,068
In the episodes that he was in, he played a
kind of love interest for Poison Ivy for a

205
00:18:31,108 --> 00:18:35,089
while. But the fact that he's getting his own
show is still kind of mind blowing. You know,

206
00:18:35,129 --> 00:18:40,491
this is Kite Man we're talking about. And I
feel really torn because on one hand, I do

207
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:46,132
think that the show is gonna be funny. The jokes
on Harley Quinn are always pretty solid and

208
00:18:46,232 --> 00:18:51,450
this seems to be continuing with that trend.
But on the other hand, it's fucking... Kite

209
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:56,731
Man with his own show and I'm sure we're gonna
laugh but I'm wondering if we're gonna care

210
00:18:57,051 --> 00:19:01,812
Yeah I mean I think the only people who are
going to tune into this are people who loved

211
00:19:01,872 --> 00:19:06,854
the character from Harley Quinn Because Kite
Man isn't the biggest name brand I gotta say

212
00:19:07,094 --> 00:19:12,735
I know this was just a teaser that was released
but it didn't do the best job of Teasing the

213
00:19:12,775 --> 00:19:17,377
humor in my opinion like there was one joke
at the beginning About Kite Man letting his

214
00:19:17,397 --> 00:19:22,439
mom know when he was going to be masturbating
when he was a boy which I guess was kind of

215
00:19:22,479 --> 00:19:27,363
funny, but the rest of the teaser was really
more action shots than anything else between

216
00:19:27,403 --> 00:19:32,587
Golden Glider and some other characters I'm
not too familiar with. You know, we'll see

217
00:19:32,627 --> 00:19:38,111
how the whole thing plays out once it's released.
I'm still not quite sure if we need a second

218
00:19:38,451 --> 00:19:44,576
Harley Quinn type series, so who knows, maybe
this one will be more action packed. I can't

219
00:19:44,636 --> 00:19:49,988
imagine that... This show will be worth the
investment that Max put into it. It just seems

220
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:55,132
very self-indulgent on behalf of the Harley
Quinn creators to even put this show out there,

221
00:19:55,152 --> 00:20:00,596
because it would have to be really, really good
in order to get people to tune in. Yeah, yeah,

222
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:05,159
I agree. Hopefully Word of Mouth is strong for
this one. Hopefully it's good enough to even

223
00:20:05,199 --> 00:20:10,483
generate Word of Mouth. Right, yeah, absolutely.
I'm not quite sold on the show yet, at least

224
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:14,986
not as much as I thought I would be by the time
we got this first teaser. And I guess I'm reserving

225
00:20:15,026 --> 00:20:18,988
judgment until we get a full on trailer and
where we get to see more of what the show will

226
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:23,950
be like. This was only a 45 second teaser and
I can't wait for something more substantial.

227
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:31,333
No word on a release date, although it does
say that it's coming too soon. That is funny.

228
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:41,683
That does it for all the news for this episode.
So let's go ahead and move into the main event

229
00:20:41,903 --> 00:20:48,173
where we find out who'd win in a team duel between
Doom Patrol and the Guardians of the Galaxy.

230
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:08,620
Alright, Duel Patrol versus Guardians of the
Galaxy. This is our ninth team duel that we've

231
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,262
done. I'll go ahead and just run down all the
other team duels that we've done. We found

232
00:21:12,422 --> 00:21:16,745
out who would win between Justice League and
the Avengers. Titans and the X-Men. Justice

233
00:21:16,785 --> 00:21:22,088
Society versus Fantastic Four. Suicide Squad
versus the Defenders. Justice League Dark versus

234
00:21:22,168 --> 00:21:28,091
Midnight Suns. Arkham Asylum versus the Sinister
Six. Young Justice versus Young Avengers. And

235
00:21:28,131 --> 00:21:33,054
the Rogues versus the Brotherhood of Mutants.
Yeah, these duels are a lot of fun. It's pretty

236
00:21:33,094 --> 00:21:38,278
hard work because we don't just compare one
character against another character as we typically

237
00:21:38,318 --> 00:21:44,863
do in our duel episodes. We compare seven characters
against seven characters. In each team duel,

238
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:50,188
the way your matrices are set up are for seven
characters, a team of seven going up against

239
00:21:50,248 --> 00:21:54,731
a team of seven. Yeah, and it's each member
going up against every other member from the

240
00:21:54,771 --> 00:22:00,996
opposing team. A lot of data. Yeah, so it's
actually 49,000 simulations that we run, which

241
00:22:01,076 --> 00:22:05,840
is a shit ton. Takes a while, but it's worth
it to settle once and for all who would win

242
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:11,024
in a fight between these misfit teams. Doom
Patrol of course is basically a freak show

243
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:16,908
team of superheroes put together by Dr. Niles
Calder and they have their own television show

244
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:21,772
on Macs that is freaking awesome. As a Marvel
fan, I didn't know much about Doom Patrol until

245
00:22:21,812 --> 00:22:26,114
I watched that show, but they have really interesting
stories. And of course, everyone loves the

246
00:22:26,134 --> 00:22:30,176
Guardians of the Galaxy movies. They're among
my favorite Marvel movies. And I'm saying that

247
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:35,038
as a DC guy, they're just really well made.
Of course, by James Gunn, who's now taking

248
00:22:35,158 --> 00:22:39,820
over DC Studios. I've been looking forward to
this match for a while, ever since it was decided

249
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:44,682
upon by the executive producers to pit these
two teams against each other. And I can't wait

250
00:22:44,702 --> 00:22:48,443
to get into it. Yeah, I guarantee you this is
going to be the only team duel we ever have,

251
00:22:48,583 --> 00:22:56,422
where we pit a talking tree against a sentient
street. It's gonna get weird guys. Yeah, hopefully

252
00:22:56,442 --> 00:23:00,983
it's bonkers. Let's get down to business. To
explain the methodology behind our duels, let's

253
00:23:01,003 --> 00:23:06,785
go to our sentient duel simulator, Alfred Jarvis
9000. AG9K, tell our listeners how you go about

254
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:11,847
determining the winner of our duel matchups.
Yes, of course, sir. The way I determine a

255
00:23:11,887 --> 00:23:16,908
winner between the two teams is by running 1000
Monte Carlo simulations between every character

256
00:23:16,948 --> 00:23:22,322
on each team using their statistics. A Monte
Carlo simulation is a probabilistic model used

257
00:23:22,362 --> 00:23:27,526
to determine outcomes through random sampling.
In this case, I randomize the statistics along

258
00:23:27,546 --> 00:23:32,170
a normal distribution as a way to simulate the
many variables that can occur during battle.

259
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:37,194
The stat parameters are based on the official
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters

260
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:42,418
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat
categories are included, such as range, damage

261
00:23:42,438 --> 00:23:47,983
potential, versatility, and perception, in order
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.

262
00:23:48,443 --> 00:23:53,158
The results of the 49,000 simulations provide
a percentage of wins for each character on

263
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:57,780
both teams. The team with the higher average
win rate is declared the victor as they have

264
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:02,602
a higher probability to win any given battle.
In an equitable pairing, neither team should

265
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:07,444
win 100% of the matches. The comic book stories
have shown that there's even a way for Batman

266
00:24:07,484 --> 00:24:11,846
to defeat Superman, so the confidence rate of
my method falls in line with the precedents

267
00:24:11,886 --> 00:24:16,988
that have been established in the source material.
My mathematical simulations are without subjectivity

268
00:24:17,048 --> 00:24:22,490
or bias. Feats are not the sole consideration.
nor are fan votes tabulated for determination

269
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:28,072
of the winner. Thanks, you, J9K. Before we run
the simulations, though, we like to break down

270
00:24:28,292 --> 00:24:34,655
each team's histories and rosters before improvising
a scenario on how we imagine one of the simulations

271
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:38,896
would play out, beat for beat. And I believe
it's my turn to go first this episode with

272
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:42,777
the Marvel backstory, so let me go ahead and
tell you all about the Guardians of the Galaxy.

273
00:24:43,234 --> 00:24:47,657
The story of the Guardians of the Galaxy began
with the incursion of the other-dimensional

274
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:54,103
despot Annihilus from the Negative Zone into
Marvel's reality. He and his Annihilation Wave

275
00:24:54,183 --> 00:25:01,289
destroyed entire galaxies, thousands of worlds,
and even several cosmic entities. This unfathomably

276
00:25:01,329 --> 00:25:07,274
large threat created unlikely alliances among
interplanetary forces and heroes from across

277
00:25:07,314 --> 00:25:12,262
the universe. Although the heroes were successful
in stopping the Annihilation Wave, their victory

278
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:18,107
came at great loss and sacrifice. This prompted
the hero Star-Lord, who was an essential strategist

279
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:23,792
in the war, to put together a team of space
warriors to prevent other future threats. The

280
00:25:23,852 --> 00:25:29,337
initial group was composed of heroes that Star-Lord
had fought alongside during Annihilus' invasion,

281
00:25:29,818 --> 00:25:36,344
including Drax the Destroyer, a being created
to kill the mad titan Thanos, and Gamora, called

282
00:25:36,384 --> 00:25:41,379
the most dangerous woman in the universe. Starlord
also recruited heroes he worked with during

283
00:25:41,419 --> 00:25:46,982
a special mission for the Kree Empire to stop
the techno-organic parasitic race, the Phalanx,

284
00:25:47,342 --> 00:25:53,325
who were led by Ultron at the time. This included
Mantis, a trained psychic, Rocket Raccoon,

285
00:25:53,525 --> 00:25:59,409
a brilliant weapons engineer, and Groot, a powerful
plant creature. Rounding out the initial team

286
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:05,932
were also Phylavel, then wielder of the Quantum
Bands, and the enigmatic Adam Warlock. Starlord,

287
00:26:06,172 --> 00:26:13,736
on the based the team at a space station made
from the giant head of a celestial cosmic being

288
00:26:13,856 --> 00:26:18,539
called Nowhere, which had a teleportation system
that could beam them nearly anywhere in the

289
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:23,462
universe. After stopping a cult known as the
Universal Church of Truth, the team happened

290
00:26:23,502 --> 00:26:30,426
upon a frozen body floating in the void of space
belonging to one Major Vance Astro, a hero

291
00:26:30,446 --> 00:26:35,349
from a far alternate future who had earned the
privilege of wielding Captain America's shield.

292
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:40,292
After thawing out his body, they learned that
Vance Astro belonged to a team of heroes known

293
00:26:40,452 --> 00:26:46,496
as the Guardians of the Galaxy, and Rocket Raccoon
stole the name for their own group. So this

294
00:26:46,536 --> 00:26:52,099
team wasn't the original Guardians of the Galaxy?
In terms of publishing chronology, no, the

295
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:56,421
original Guardians of the Galaxy team came out
in the 1960s, but that was in an alternate

296
00:26:56,481 --> 00:27:02,004
universe. In the Marvel 616 continuity, the
Guardians team started being published in the

297
00:27:02,044 --> 00:27:07,707
early 2000s. Interesting. The Guardians unsuccessfully
tried to intervene diplomatically when war

298
00:27:07,747 --> 00:27:12,408
broke out between the Inhumans and the Shi'ar
alien race, and had to deal with the fallout

299
00:27:12,448 --> 00:27:16,989
of the conflict which opened up a rift in the
fabric of the universe into a dimension where

300
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:22,971
death did not exist and all life had been corrupted.
Although the Guardians helped seal the rift,

301
00:27:23,371 --> 00:27:28,153
Star-Lord and Nova sacrificed themselves to
stay behind in that dimension in order to keep

302
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:33,512
Thanos from escaping. Without their leader,
The Guardians disbanded and the chief of security

303
00:27:33,592 --> 00:27:39,117
at nowhere, Cosmo the Space Dog, assembled a
new team for a time called the Annihilators,

304
00:27:39,438 --> 00:27:45,123
which you can learn more about in our Red Lantern
Deck Star vs Cosmo the Space Dog duel episode.

305
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:50,288
Eventually, Star-Lord was able to return to
his dimension with the reality-warping device

306
00:27:50,408 --> 00:27:54,712
the Cosmic Cube. After the Guardians of the
Galaxy prevented the podune alien invasion

307
00:27:54,752 --> 00:28:00,197
of Earth, Jason Star-Lord's father and king
of the planet Spartax arrested the team for

308
00:28:00,237 --> 00:28:06,082
violating a new galactic law that declared Earth
neutral territory. However, the Guardians escaped

309
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:11,866
with the help of Groot, Jason was subsequently
deposed, and the Spartax Council crowned Star-Lord

310
00:28:12,026 --> 00:28:18,011
as their new leader due to his popularity as
a galactic hero. Enraged, Jason obliterated

311
00:28:18,051 --> 00:28:23,916
Hala, the capital planet of the alien Kree Empire,
in order to obtain a celestial created object

312
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:29,259
called the Black Vortex. which was capable of
evolving a being to their fullest potential.

313
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:35,040
Jason used it to encase the planet Spartax in
an energy construct, but the Guardians were

314
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:40,602
able to free the people and defeat Jason with
help from the X-Men member, Kitty Pride. While

315
00:28:40,622 --> 00:28:45,824
the team initially assisted Star-Lord with his
duties as ruler of Spartax, they eventually

316
00:28:45,904 --> 00:28:51,250
separated ways from him, and Rocket Raccoon
became the new leader of the Guardians. However,

317
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:56,832
one former Kree accuser blamed Star-Lord and
Spartax for Jason's actions against the former

318
00:28:56,892 --> 00:29:02,254
Throneworld and launched an assault against
the Spartoi army. The Guardians assisted in

319
00:29:02,294 --> 00:29:07,496
the battle to defeat the accuser, though Star-Lord
was blamed for the damage to the planet Spartax

320
00:29:07,616 --> 00:29:12,619
and was stripped of his title as King. The Guardians
of the Galaxy then reunited under their original

321
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:17,821
leader, but the team was now branded as outlaws
and fugitives. While trying to protect the

322
00:29:17,861 --> 00:29:22,030
cosmos while clashing with the Nova Corps, The
Guardians found themselves in the middle of

323
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:27,873
a feud between two elders of the universe, the
Grandmaster and the Collector, which ended

324
00:29:27,913 --> 00:29:33,135
in a truce and Star-Lord was gifted an Infinity
Stone. The Guardians were able to use the Power

325
00:29:33,155 --> 00:29:39,518
Stone to fend off the Chitauri aliens, but Star-Lord
disbanded the team again to join Dr. Strange's

326
00:29:39,618 --> 00:29:45,200
new Infinity Watch, a group of Infinity Stone
wielders assembled to prevent Thanos, who was

327
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,082
believed to be dead at the time, from acquiring
the stones. You can learn more about Thanos

328
00:29:50,162 --> 00:29:55,545
in our Darkseid vs Thanos duel episode. Eventually,
Thanos did return from the dead possessing

329
00:29:55,585 --> 00:30:01,668
the body of his brother Starfox, and the Guardians
had to reunite to defeat him. After the formation

330
00:30:01,708 --> 00:30:06,631
of the Galactic Council in the wake of the new
Kree-Skrull alliance led by young Avenger Hulkling,

331
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:11,134
whom you can learn more about in our Miss Martian
vs Hulkling duel episode, the Guardians of

332
00:30:11,154 --> 00:30:14,976
the Galaxy were officially sanctioned as protectors
of the cosmos.

333
00:30:19,058 --> 00:30:25,742
and an expanded roster that included Nova, Quasar,
Nebula, and the Super Scroll. And that's the

334
00:30:25,762 --> 00:30:30,385
history of the Guardians. For this team duel
of seven characters, I wanted to include as

335
00:30:30,566 --> 00:30:35,769
many of the 2000's Guardians original roster
as possible, since they've been with the team

336
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:41,213
the longest and are more well known because
of the Marvel Studios films. So obviously I'm

337
00:30:41,253 --> 00:30:44,955
starting out with the one who formed the team,
Peter Quill aka Star

338
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:54,215
element guns, and arsenal of various gadgets.
By his side will be Gamora carrying a sword

339
00:30:54,275 --> 00:31:00,401
and pair of daggers. Drax the Destroyer is also
joining, armed with his signature knives. Rocket

340
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:05,846
Raccoon will take up the fourth slot, packing
a big ass energy blaster, a smaller ass energy

341
00:31:05,886 --> 00:31:11,311
blaster, his jet boots, and enough explosives
to destroy a whole city. Groot is next on the

342
00:31:11,351 --> 00:31:15,854
team, and he'll be bringing just himself because
that's all he needs. The second to last spot

343
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:20,177
will be held by Mantis, since I think her empathic
and psychic abilities will bring something

344
00:31:20,237 --> 00:31:25,481
new to the table. And finally, I'm going with
Adam Warlock, because the guy's a powerhouse

345
00:31:25,501 --> 00:31:29,443
with like so many different powers, and I think
I'll need his versatility to round out the

346
00:31:29,463 --> 00:31:37,969
team's stats. So again, that's Starlord, Gamora,
Drax, Rocket, Groot, Mantis, and Warlock. And

347
00:31:37,989 --> 00:31:40,751
they're going to put the Doom to the Doom Patrol.

348
00:31:45,095 --> 00:31:47,185
X to the guardians of the galaxy.

349
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:58,483
So bad. I don't know. Let me get into their
backstory. So the Doom Patrol was created by

350
00:31:58,543 --> 00:32:05,286
Dr. Niles Calder, a genius scientific polymath
who accidentally paralyzed himself in order

351
00:32:05,306 --> 00:32:11,469
to remove a bomb implanted in his spine by the
Nazi villain General Immortus, who had secretly

352
00:32:11,509 --> 00:32:18,331
hired Niles to create a formula for immortality.
Though Niles freed himself from General Immortus'

353
00:32:18,371 --> 00:32:24,694
control, he was left distraught and depressed
over his new handicap. Eventually realizing

354
00:32:24,714 --> 00:32:31,038
he needed to stop General Immortus, however,
Niles developed a theory he called the Catastrophe

355
00:32:31,078 --> 00:32:36,602
Curve, which stated that traumatic, life-altering
events such as what Niles had gone through

356
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:42,786
would force people to adapt and emerge stronger
and more capable than they were before. Deducing

357
00:32:42,806 --> 00:32:48,289
that a team of traumatized and ostracized individuals
could be strong enough to take on the world's

358
00:32:48,329 --> 00:32:53,547
villains, While also challenging the stigmas
that Niles and other handicapped individuals

359
00:32:53,607 --> 00:32:59,970
faced, Niles developed technologies and therapies
to help three individuals who had gone through

360
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:06,533
horrific accidents overcome their injuries and
develop superpowers as a result. This included

361
00:33:06,633 --> 00:33:12,695
Cliff Steele, a race car driver whose body was
destroyed during a race. Niles was able to

362
00:33:12,735 --> 00:33:18,922
salvage Cliff's brain and put it in a robotic
body, creating Robotman. When Hollywood darling

363
00:33:19,002 --> 00:33:24,463
Rita Farr was in an on-set accident that exposed
her to chemical vapors that caused her body

364
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:30,245
to become malleable, Niles helped train her
to maintain and control her shape to become

365
00:33:30,465 --> 00:33:35,967
Elasti-Girl. When the guidance system on Air
Force Test Pilot Lurie Chynar's experimental

366
00:33:36,067 --> 00:33:40,688
aircraft malfunctioned, sending him through
a field of radiation that caused his body to

367
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:46,589
become irradiated with an other dimensional
entity, Niles developed radiation-proof bandages

368
00:33:46,946 --> 00:33:53,051
that allowed Larry to be around and help others
as Negative Man. Initially hiding his identity

369
00:33:53,191 --> 00:33:58,936
under the alias The Chief, Niles led the first
iteration of the Doom Patrol from their Midway

370
00:33:58,976 --> 00:34:04,080
City headquarters against General Immortus and
some of the planet's most bizarre villains,

371
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:11,046
including Animal Vegetable Mineral Man and Monsieur
Malah and the Brain. Rita eventually married

372
00:34:11,146 --> 00:34:16,734
a telepath named Steve Dayton, who joined the
team as the hero Mento. and the two of them

373
00:34:16,894 --> 00:34:22,720
adopted the shapeshifting youngster Garfield
Logan, aka Beast Boy, who you can learn more

374
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:28,385
about in our Beast Boy vs. Beast episode. Niles
attempted to reform and bring his romantic

375
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:34,290
interest, Madame Rouge of the Brotherhood of
Evil, onto the team, though he failed and she,

376
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:39,775
along with the villain General Zal, were responsible
for the death of the original four-member team

377
00:34:39,875 --> 00:34:45,142
of the Doom Patrol when they chose to sacrifice
their lives rather than allow the town of Codsville,

378
00:34:45,202 --> 00:34:51,045
Maine, and its population of 14, to be destroyed.
You can learn more about Madame Rouge in her

379
00:34:51,105 --> 00:34:57,067
dual episode with Mystique. Eventually, a new
Doom Patrol team, also based in Midway City,

380
00:34:57,407 --> 00:35:03,810
was formed by Niles' mysterious widow, a woman
named Arani Desai, who went by the superhero

381
00:35:03,850 --> 00:35:10,333
codename Celsius, as she was able to control
temperature. In an effort to stop General Immortus

382
00:35:10,453 --> 00:35:16,624
and find her husband Niles, whom she believed
to still be alive, Arani brought together Joshua

383
00:35:16,664 --> 00:35:23,728
Clay, an energy controlling medic known as Tempest,
the Russian spy Valentia Vostok, who inherited

384
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:30,192
Negative Man's radioactive negative spirit entity
to become Negative Woman, and Robotman, who

385
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:35,335
had been rebuilt by Dr. William Magnus, a robotics
engineer that you can learn more about in our

386
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:40,938
Metal Men versus Colossus episode. The team
moved to Kansas City, and increased their ranks

387
00:35:40,978 --> 00:35:46,982
to include Lodestone, who could manipulate the
electromagnetic spectrum, Karma, who generated

388
00:35:47,102 --> 00:35:53,586
bad luck in others, and a young boy named Scott
Fisher with a burning touch. This version of

389
00:35:53,626 --> 00:35:59,089
the team discovered that both Larry Trainor
and Niles Calder survived the explosion that

390
00:35:59,129 --> 00:36:05,173
killed the Doom Patrol, though Niles denied
ever being married to Irani. Irani died during

391
00:36:05,193 --> 00:36:10,068
the invasion storyline, that also resulted in
Negative Woman losing her connection to the

392
00:36:10,088 --> 00:36:15,873
Negative Spirit, Scott Fisher succumbing to
leukemia, and Lodestone falling into a coma.

393
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:21,918
The team disbanded, though was soon reformed
by Niles Calder, with Negative Man returning,

394
00:36:22,258 --> 00:36:27,502
though Larry involuntarily merged with a nurse
named Eleanor Poole to form a new Negative

395
00:36:27,642 --> 00:36:33,467
entity known as Rebus. Robot Man also returned
after an episode of depression and a stint

396
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:41,369
at a mental facility with dissociative identity
disorder named Crazy Jane, who also joined

397
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:47,494
the team. Joshua Clay agreed to stay on the
team as its medic, and soon after a young girl

398
00:36:47,554 --> 00:36:52,538
named Dorothy Spinner, capable of bringing her
imaginary friends to life, also joined the

399
00:36:52,578 --> 00:36:58,283
team. When they discovered that the comatose
Lodestone was being held captive by a supernatural

400
00:36:58,363 --> 00:37:04,548
serial killer named Red Jack, the team came
to her rescue, only for Lodestone to wake up

401
00:37:04,648 --> 00:37:10,733
in a and kill Red Jack herself. The team was
based in the Justice League's former secret

402
00:37:10,773 --> 00:37:16,757
sanctuary headquarters until they met Danny
the Street, a teleporting sentient genderqueer

403
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:23,661
pocket dimension upon whom lived Flexmantallo,
a muscle-bound man of muscle mystery. When

404
00:37:23,681 --> 00:37:28,885
a malevolent entity known as the Candlemaker
that posed as one of Dorothy's imaginary friends

405
00:37:29,005 --> 00:37:36,458
was unleashed, the team suffered massive casualties,
with Robotman's brain getting and Joshua being

406
00:37:36,478 --> 00:37:42,402
killed by Niles, just before it was revealed
that Niles was responsible for the accidents

407
00:37:42,723 --> 00:37:48,226
that befell the original team members and he
was decapitated by the Candlemaker. Once the

408
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:54,611
Candlemaker was defeated, several of the team's
members, including Crazy Jane and Rebus, decided

409
00:37:54,651 --> 00:38:00,074
to leave the team to retire on Danny, who by
this point had grown to the size of a planet.

410
00:38:00,615 --> 00:38:07,219
After Robotman was rebuilt by Dr. Magnus again,
he Dorothy and Niles, whose head was kept alive

411
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:12,261
with nanobots, moved into an abandoned country
club known as the Rainbow Estates that was

412
00:38:12,301 --> 00:38:18,143
haunted by sex ghosts who were used to power
the team's technology. The team took on the

413
00:38:18,203 --> 00:38:23,725
Bandage People, a married couple named George
and Marion who were wrapped in bandages, and

414
00:38:23,785 --> 00:38:30,208
a transgender superhero named Kate Godwin, aka
Quagula, who could control states of matter.

415
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:40,492
Alice wired for sound, he left the team to enter
the Tree of Life, and only Robotman, Coagula,

416
00:38:40,632 --> 00:38:45,975
and Dorothy remained, though Dorothy destroyed
both of them during a psychic meltdown that

417
00:38:46,055 --> 00:38:51,697
also put her into a coma. A new corporate version
of the Doom Patrol was later formed by a wealthy

418
00:38:51,757 --> 00:38:58,460
industrialist named Thayer Jost as a young superteam
with members named Fast Forward, Fever, Freak,

419
00:39:01,294 --> 00:39:06,618
though this version of Robotman was revealed
to be an imaginary version created by the still

420
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:12,883
comatose Dorothy. The other members of the team
found and revived the real Robotman, who made

421
00:39:12,943 --> 00:39:18,307
the difficult decision to remove Dorothy from
life support, after which the team disbanded.

422
00:39:18,727 --> 00:39:24,492
During the Infinite Crisis event, where Superboy
Prime and Alexander Luther of Earth 3 created

423
00:39:27,106 --> 00:39:32,590
The original Doom Patrol of Niles, Robotman,
Elastigirl, and Larry Trainer as Negative Man

424
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:38,774
were revealed to be a team once again. After
recovering their memories of past continuity,

425
00:39:39,075 --> 00:39:44,399
they learned that Elastigirl had been regrown
by Niles from a fragment of her skull that

426
00:39:44,419 --> 00:39:50,343
he had uncovered. The team reunited with Mento
and aided the Teen Titans, during which it

427
00:39:50,383 --> 00:39:55,783
was revealed that Niles was manipulating the
team. in order to cure them as a form of penance

428
00:39:55,823 --> 00:40:00,925
for having orchestrated their accidents in the
past. Niles was kicked off of the team, with

429
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:06,447
both Mento and Beast Boy assuming leadership
for a brief time, and with the Titan heroes

430
00:40:06,507 --> 00:40:12,170
Vox and Bumblebee joining the Doom Patrol. When
the team set up their headquarters on Oolong

431
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:19,033
Island, Crazy Jane and Danny returned, though
the latter as a brick, and Ambish Bug also

432
00:40:19,093 --> 00:40:25,105
joined the team. After the Flashpoint event
reset DC's continuity, the original four-member

433
00:40:25,145 --> 00:40:32,470
team of Niles, Robotman, Elastigwomen now, and
Negativeman were joined by Elementwomen. When

434
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:37,614
Niles and the team attempted to capture Jessica
Cruz, the Green Lantern, to get her onto the

435
00:40:37,654 --> 00:40:43,418
team, it was revealed by Lex Luthor that Niles
had caused the team's accidents, and they went

436
00:40:43,478 --> 00:40:49,410
their separate ways. The team was eventually
brought back together by Casey Brink. a comic

437
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:55,212
book character from Danny the Street's self-published
series that was brought to life. The team helped

438
00:40:55,312 --> 00:41:00,274
save Danny from aliens who were trying to force
him to mass produce meat for their intergalactic

439
00:41:00,314 --> 00:41:05,336
chain of fast food restaurants. After Niles
attempted to recruit the team for a mission

440
00:41:05,636 --> 00:41:10,278
that turned out to be a form of payment for
Niles' gambling debts, the team kicked him

441
00:41:10,438 --> 00:41:16,841
out. Currently, the Doom Patrol is led by Crazy
Jane, now controlled by an alternate personality

442
00:41:16,901 --> 00:41:26,170
known and consists of Robotman, Elastigwoman,
Negativeman, and newcomers Beast Girl and Degenerate.

443
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:32,253
For my team, I'm definitely starting with Robotman,
as he is the only Doom Patrol member that has

444
00:41:32,313 --> 00:41:38,096
been a part of each incarnation of the team.
I'm also going with Dr. Niles Calder, aka the

445
00:41:38,156 --> 00:41:43,519
Chief, as he was the team's founder, as well
as Negativeman and Elastigwoman since they

446
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:44,840
were original members.

447
00:41:48,162 --> 00:41:53,804
Though I've already used Beast Boy in our Titans
vs X-Men team duel episode, and there are definitely

448
00:41:53,884 --> 00:42:00,487
more interesting Doom Patrol members than Mento,
including Crazy Jane, Dorothy Spinner, and

449
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:05,689
Danny the Street, each of whom have been made
popular by the Doom Patrol television series

450
00:42:05,769 --> 00:42:11,151
on Max, and who were chosen by our executive
producers. So that rounds out my seven member

451
00:42:11,191 --> 00:42:19,943
team. Robot Man, The Chief, Negative Man, Elastigwomen,
Crazy Jane, Dorothy Spinner and Danny the Street.

452
00:42:20,443 --> 00:42:23,604
I should note that if you want to learn more
about any of the characters on my roster or

453
00:42:23,664 --> 00:42:27,966
Jonathan's roster, check out their individual
dual episodes because they all have them. Yeah,

454
00:42:27,986 --> 00:42:32,728
some of them are pretty old, but they exist.
I had to say listening to the history of the

455
00:42:32,768 --> 00:42:38,610
Doom Patrol, I think the only team that has
disbanded and reformed more than them is the

456
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:43,732
Guardians of the Galaxy. I don't think I quite
gave across the impression that the Guardians

457
00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:49,046
split up and reform over and over again. Yeah,
that's the case. I kind of skipped over it

458
00:42:49,086 --> 00:42:54,148
because it got annoying after a while. But that's
something these teams definitely have in common.

459
00:42:54,608 --> 00:42:58,349
And in the Deer Patrol's instance, it's always
something to do with Niles Colder and how he

460
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:03,450
fucked up. Yeah, with the Guardians, it's usually
something dealing with Peter Quill. The original

461
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:09,392
Guardians team only formed because he had Mantis
psychically manipulate the group into coming

462
00:43:09,432 --> 00:43:14,873
together. Oh, no way. Oh, that's interesting.
Yeah, you have some shitty shit going on both

463
00:43:14,913 --> 00:43:15,213
sides.

464
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:27,512
Well, now that we've got the histories and rosters
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

465
00:43:27,552 --> 00:43:32,875
of the simulated matches will go. The winning
team is determined by simulations, not this

466
00:43:32,935 --> 00:43:38,898
speculation, but it's fun to imagine how this
fight could play out. Alfred Jarvis9000, what

467
00:43:38,918 --> 00:43:44,541
are the rules of our speculation? Well, I should
say there are no rules, other than the teams

468
00:43:44,561 --> 00:43:49,124
have no prior knowledge of the other going into
the fight. All they are aware of starting out

469
00:43:49,484 --> 00:43:54,167
is that the other side is a threat that needs
to be eliminated. For the speculation, the

470
00:43:54,187 --> 00:43:58,730
groups will begin approximately 50 meters apart
in a non-descript environment that will have

471
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:03,973
no bearing on the match itself, as no environmental
statistics are considered in my simulations.

472
00:44:04,454 --> 00:44:09,477
The teams must earn victory on their own merit.
Alright then, let's get into it. Doom Patrol

473
00:44:09,637 --> 00:44:15,642
and Guardians of the Galaxy meet on the battlefield.
Who goes first? So I imagine starting out that

474
00:44:15,722 --> 00:44:20,805
the Doom Patrol is standing on Denny the Street,
just looking at the Guardians of the Galaxy.

475
00:44:21,466 --> 00:44:26,009
and like a marquee above a theater on Danny
is gonna read, who the hell are these guys?

476
00:44:29,051 --> 00:44:33,974
And then Groot's gonna be like, I am Groot,
which means we're the freaking guardians of

477
00:44:33,994 --> 00:44:40,298
the galaxy, except he doesn't say the word freaking,
but that line is gonna be like the team's rallying

478
00:44:40,339 --> 00:44:45,362
cry and they're gonna charge into battle and
Rocket Raccoon is gonna start off who's riding

479
00:44:45,422 --> 00:44:50,405
on Groot's shoulder and he's gonna fire a grenade
launcher that shoots out this volley of explosions.

480
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:56,634
that just rain down on Danny the Street and
the rest of the Doom Patrol. Okay, but just

481
00:44:56,734 --> 00:45:01,617
before those explosives land and the Guardians
reach the Doom Patrol, Danny's just going to

482
00:45:01,697 --> 00:45:07,902
teleport the Doom Patrol right behind the Guardians.
And Negative Man is going to get the jump on

483
00:45:07,922 --> 00:45:14,446
them by firing out his negative spirit that
just tears through rockets and like Drax and

484
00:45:14,466 --> 00:45:21,343
Gamora at Sonic Speed, causing them this debilitating
pain. Yeah, but when Negative Man sends out

485
00:45:21,383 --> 00:45:26,548
his negative spirit, he just, his body just
like collapses to the ground, right? Yeah,

486
00:45:26,588 --> 00:45:30,371
but like, you know, I'm sure Danny is gonna
hide his body in a basement to keep it safe

487
00:45:30,411 --> 00:45:37,137
or something like that. It's fine. Well, unfortunately
for the negative spirit, I'll say the Guardians

488
00:45:37,197 --> 00:45:43,804
have a member who deals with like matters of
the spirit all the time. And that's Adam Warlock,

489
00:45:43,944 --> 00:45:48,763
who is the former wielder of the Soul Gem. So
Adam Warlock, he's going to psychically hone

490
00:45:48,823 --> 00:45:53,765
in on the negative spirit and he's going to
trap it in this like cosmic energy cocoon that

491
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:59,467
the spirit can't phase out of. Meaning negative
man is screwed because doesn't he die if the

492
00:45:59,507 --> 00:46:04,089
negative spirit doesn't return back to his body
within a certain amount of time? It used to

493
00:46:04,109 --> 00:46:09,631
be 60 seconds, but like that amount of time
has increased significantly in recent years.

494
00:46:10,151 --> 00:46:14,953
So, you know, we'll see what we can do about
that later. Meanwhile, Elastawoman grows to

495
00:46:15,013 --> 00:46:23,356
six stories tall. and stomps on Star Lord. You
mean she tries to stomp on Star Lord, but as

496
00:46:23,396 --> 00:46:29,000
he sees her gargantuan foot like descending
on him, he's going to blast her with his element

497
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:34,405
guns, which encase both of her legs in ice,
freezing them so she can't move. And she's

498
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:39,950
just stuck there with one leg in the air. And
that's when Groot runs over and he grows himself

499
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:45,414
to giant size to match Elastigwomans height,
and he just knocks her over. sending her crashing

500
00:46:45,454 --> 00:46:50,355
to the ground. Well, I mean, Alessa Woman is
basically made out of silly putty, so the fall's

501
00:46:50,395 --> 00:46:58,397
not actually going to hurt her, and she'll just
shrink back down to escape the ice. But meanwhile,

502
00:46:58,437 --> 00:47:04,959
crazy Jane turns into Sun Daddy, like this two-story
tall woman with a sun fur ahead, and she's

503
00:47:04,999 --> 00:47:11,181
gonna hurl fireballs at Groot, setting his ass
on fire. Oh shit, uh, except that she doesn't

504
00:47:11,721 --> 00:47:16,435
do that. What? Son Daddy thought she wanted
to hurt Groot, but then she suddenly decides

505
00:47:16,475 --> 00:47:21,756
that, you know, she likes him. And instead she
turns all of her anger and negative emotions

506
00:47:22,096 --> 00:47:28,698
to that guy over there in the wheelchair and
sets his ass on fire. And that is because Mantis

507
00:47:28,838 --> 00:47:35,640
got a vision of the future of Groot on fire.
And so to prevent it, she empathically manipulated

508
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:41,566
Crazy Jane's mind. Okay. Son Daddy hurls a fireball
towards the chief, which He's just going to

509
00:47:41,606 --> 00:47:46,189
block with the force field because he already
has that activated, right? But Crazy Jane's

510
00:47:46,329 --> 00:47:50,912
alters her other personalities. They're going
to realize right away that she's being psychically

511
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:57,197
manipulated. So they're going to break up that
psychic connection by sending up Silvertongue

512
00:47:57,337 --> 00:48:03,021
from the underground, who is going to take control
of Crazy Jane's body and be like, stay out

513
00:48:03,061 --> 00:48:08,905
of my mind. And those words are going to turn
into these blades in midair that fly at Mantis

514
00:48:08,925 --> 00:48:14,788
and slice her up. No, no, because Gamora is
going to leap into the way and block all of

515
00:48:14,828 --> 00:48:19,811
these flying blades with her sword, just knocking
him out of the air with her badass sword skills.

516
00:48:20,291 --> 00:48:24,073
And then she's going to like slide tackle Crazy
Jane to the ground and then just jam a dagger

517
00:48:24,093 --> 00:48:29,777
in her chest. And while that's happening, Drax
is going to run over to one of the Doom Patrol

518
00:48:29,797 --> 00:48:34,879
members to fight them. But it turns out it's
Dorothy Spinner. She turns around and Drax

519
00:48:34,899 --> 00:48:39,554
sees that it's just a young girl. So it's awkward
because like Drax... doesn't want to fight

520
00:48:39,574 --> 00:48:43,537
her because she probably reminds him of his
daughter. So he's like, go away, get out of

521
00:48:43,557 --> 00:48:47,480
here, hairy child. And then he's going to run
over a robot man and just plow into him like

522
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:52,163
a charging bull. I mean, Drax probably shouldn't
have caught the attention of Dorothy spinner

523
00:48:52,603 --> 00:48:58,848
because before he even reaches robot man, Dorothy's
like, Cliff, look out. And she's going to unleash

524
00:48:59,368 --> 00:49:04,472
dark is the morning that looks like a shadow
with like a huge fanged mouth. And that's going

525
00:49:04,492 --> 00:49:09,287
to shoot over to Drax and just bite down on
his head. Meanwhile, a robot man sees this

526
00:49:09,527 --> 00:49:14,590
and he's like, what the fuck? And while Drax
is distracted and his face is covered, that's

527
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:21,235
when Robotman runs up and just kicks Drax right
in the nuts. All right. So Drax is going to

528
00:49:21,255 --> 00:49:26,319
fall to the floor and puke from the pain. But
since this shadow creature is like chomped

529
00:49:26,379 --> 00:49:31,242
down over his head, he's going to puke into
the shadow creature and it's going to cause

530
00:49:31,262 --> 00:49:35,485
it to dissipate. And Drax is going to be like,
victoriously like, I vanquish the monster.

531
00:49:35,785 --> 00:49:39,748
Rocket. sees all this happening and he just
shakes his head before leaping over to the

532
00:49:39,808 --> 00:49:45,212
chief and he's like, oh, I'm going to get that
wheelchair. So he pulls out and then rolls

533
00:49:45,292 --> 00:49:50,416
over an explosive grenade toward the chief that
detonates right underneath his seat and launches

534
00:49:50,436 --> 00:49:56,980
him out of the chair. Okay, but the chief has
sensors in his chair that will notify him if

535
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:01,944
there's like a nearby explosive. So the chief
does launch out of the wheelchair, but he's

536
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:06,766
in an ejector seat with a parachute. And as
he's floating to the ground from high in the

537
00:50:06,786 --> 00:50:12,149
sky, he's gonna pull out a handgun and take
aim at Mantis, and he's gonna shoot her in

538
00:50:12,169 --> 00:50:19,352
the chest. So she's out of the match. Okay,
Mantis gets shot, but before she dies from

539
00:50:19,372 --> 00:50:25,575
the wound, she's gonna actually project her
astral form out of her body. And her spirit's

540
00:50:25,595 --> 00:50:30,037
gonna travel over to Groot and possess his mind
because, you know, she can communicate with

541
00:50:30,077 --> 00:50:35,961
plant life as part of her training. And... She
has the ability to reform a new body out of

542
00:50:35,981 --> 00:50:42,366
vegetation. That's why she's the color green.
So she has Groot use his powers to create this

543
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:46,830
like plant woman, essentially. And then Mantis
is going to inhabit it with her mind, form

544
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:53,496
it into her new body. And it's like she never
left. She's back in action. That's dumb. But

545
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:59,842
by this point, the negative spirit that was
inside of Adam Warlock's cosmic cocoon. It's

546
00:50:59,862 --> 00:51:05,424
gonna explode out of that because it was able
to absorb all of that cosmic energy and evolve

547
00:51:05,464 --> 00:51:11,947
into a more powerful form like Rebus who also
formed in this cosmic egg type cocoon and it's

548
00:51:11,967 --> 00:51:16,889
gonna dive into Danny the Street, repossess
Negative Man that's just gonna make him stronger

549
00:51:17,049 --> 00:51:22,611
and now capable of flight so Negative Man flies
out of Danny's basement and goes toe-to-toe

550
00:51:22,891 --> 00:51:29,014
with Adam Warlock just trading blows and blasting
him with powerful radioactive beams Bet Adam

551
00:51:29,054 --> 00:51:34,796
Warlock regretted that. I mean, Adam Warlock
has energy shields, so he's able to block these

552
00:51:34,816 --> 00:51:41,639
beams with his energy force fields. And then
he's going to use quantum magic to just exercise

553
00:51:41,679 --> 00:51:46,661
the negative spirit out of negative man's body
while he's flying midair. What? And that's

554
00:51:46,681 --> 00:51:50,503
going to cause the negative man to just fall
down to the ground to his death. So negative

555
00:51:50,523 --> 00:51:56,778
man's dead. Fine. And then Adam Warlock's going
to manipulate the negative spirit energy. into

556
00:51:56,798 --> 00:52:02,541
like this like energy ball, removing the consciousness
within. And then he's going to hurl this energy

557
00:52:02,561 --> 00:52:08,004
ball at Robotman, just exploding Robotman's
limbs all over the battlefield. Now, except

558
00:52:08,044 --> 00:52:13,688
that before this energy ball even hits Robotman,
Danny is going to erect a stop sign that's

559
00:52:13,708 --> 00:52:19,471
going to deflect it like just enough that it
misses Robotman, its target. But we'll say

560
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:25,130
it probably hits like one of Danny's buildings.
And that's going to hurt Danny. enough to probably

561
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:30,593
make him shrink down so that he becomes Danny
the Tank, which Robotman is gonna hop inside

562
00:52:30,853 --> 00:52:37,817
and drive, all right? And Robotman's gonna take
aim at Groot, just blasting him with this explosive

563
00:52:37,857 --> 00:52:45,021
tank shell, and that's gonna reduce him to twigs.
Oh shit, okay, so Groot gets blasted, but that

564
00:52:45,101 --> 00:52:51,865
pisses Rocket off, who by this point reconstructed
the Chief's wheelchair into this powerful energy

565
00:52:51,885 --> 00:52:57,736
cannon. that he shoots at Danny the Tank and
just blasts it with enough force to turn him

566
00:52:57,796 --> 00:53:04,880
into Danny the Brick. Ugh. So, Danny's out,
and Robotman gets blown like, dozens of yards

567
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:11,044
away, right next to Star-Lord. And, uh, the
two size each other up, and Star-Lord looks

568
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:17,147
at him, and he turns up his Walkman to the maximum
volume. And then he hits play, and starts doing

569
00:53:17,167 --> 00:53:22,669
the Thriller dance. Oh shit, is this like a
dance-off? It's a dance-off, bro! Me and you.

570
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:32,786
Alright, so, Robotman, he'll counter with the
robot. He's gonna be like, Tomo arigato, Mr.

571
00:53:32,846 --> 00:53:39,970
Robot. Pop and lock, pop and lock. Ooh, can't
touch this. Alright, then Star-Lord starts

572
00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:42,591
doing the pendulum from the right stuff. He's
like, oh,

573
00:53:45,773 --> 00:53:51,276
oh. Oh, look, Robotman is on the ground doing
the worm. And then he segues into like, the

574
00:53:51,336 --> 00:53:56,780
windmill into a head spin. Oh! Then he jumps
to his feet and he's like, top that motherfucker.

575
00:53:59,142 --> 00:54:05,888
And then Star-Lord just shoots Robotman with
electrical energy blasts, just flying his circuits.

576
00:54:06,008 --> 00:54:11,753
It was all just a distraction and Robotman fell
for it. So Robotman's out of the match. It

577
00:54:11,773 --> 00:54:20,739
was worth it. OK, Dorothy saw this. And she
loves Cliff, so she is like emotionally traumatized.

578
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:26,860
And she's gonna hear the candle maker whisper
in her head, make a wish. So she does. And

579
00:54:27,561 --> 00:54:32,922
suddenly Star-Lord's mask is gonna turn into
this like monster demon creature wrapped around

580
00:54:32,942 --> 00:54:38,924
his face that just suffocates him and kills
him. Oh, geez. Like a face hugger? Exactly,

581
00:54:39,044 --> 00:54:44,750
exactly. From alien? Scary, freaky alien monster.
Geez. Meanwhile, Crazy Jane. She was on the

582
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:50,371
ground bleeding from the wound Gamora stabbed
in her chest, but the Hangman's beautiful daughter

583
00:54:50,411 --> 00:54:56,353
personality takes control and paints a bandage
on the ground using her blood, which then is

584
00:54:56,373 --> 00:55:02,194
going to become real, and she uses that bandage
to stop the bleeding, after which she gets

585
00:55:02,414 --> 00:55:09,096
taken control of by Black Annis, you know, with
her red eyes, blue skin, and she has these

586
00:55:09,376 --> 00:55:10,597
like four razor-sharp,

587
00:55:13,930 --> 00:55:19,973
So she's in control and she's going to attack
Drax cause she hates men. And she's going to

588
00:55:20,013 --> 00:55:25,015
stab him right in the chest with all eight claws,
like right into his heart. These are like Wolverine

589
00:55:25,035 --> 00:55:29,778
claws. Like are they made out of adamantium?
Cause like they'd have to be pretty dang sharp

590
00:55:29,798 --> 00:55:37,062
to cut into Drax. I mean, they're like supernatural
blades. Okay. All right. Well, Drax is going

591
00:55:37,082 --> 00:55:41,724
to look down and he's going to see these claws
sticking into his chest and he's going to be

592
00:55:41,744 --> 00:55:47,819
like, my nipples. And then he's gonna be like,
die. And he's gonna shove both of his blades

593
00:55:47,899 --> 00:55:52,601
into her neck. So basically they're gonna take
each other out. They both bleed out. They're

594
00:55:52,621 --> 00:55:58,764
both out of the match. But Gamora, she saw what
Dorothy Spinner did to Star-Lord. So she knows

595
00:55:58,784 --> 00:56:03,026
this little girl has to go down. But she's like,
no one wants to see Dorothy get stabbed or

596
00:56:03,046 --> 00:56:07,647
anything. So what Gamora's gonna do is she's
gonna sneak up behind Dorothy and just yeet

597
00:56:07,687 --> 00:56:13,238
her. What? Yeah, she picks up this 90 pound,
like pipsqueak of a child and just. freaking

598
00:56:13,278 --> 00:56:17,620
tosses her toward their horizon. You know, probably
killing her, not in a way that anyone could

599
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:22,122
see or certainly describe. Out of sight, out
of mind. But Dorothy's out of the match. Being

600
00:56:22,142 --> 00:56:29,225
your father changes you, right? Yeah, yeah.
Okay, we'll say that while that happened, the

601
00:56:29,265 --> 00:56:35,187
chief has landed safely near Robotman, who's
been deactivated, and he's gonna plug into

602
00:56:35,247 --> 00:56:41,406
him like a nanobot cartridge that repairs and
upgrades Robotman's systems. So Robotman's

603
00:56:41,426 --> 00:56:46,888
back online, he's like, fuck yeah. And the chief
tells him to go after the raccoon's gun because

604
00:56:46,908 --> 00:56:53,791
the chief wants it. So Robotman runs up near
Rocket and pulls his energy cannon out of his

605
00:56:53,831 --> 00:57:00,974
hands using magnetic upgrades. And that's when
he uses that cannon to blast Adam Warlock to

606
00:57:01,014 --> 00:57:06,556
smithereens. It was just like dialed up all
the way. And before Rocket even has the time

607
00:57:06,576 --> 00:57:12,198
to react, he's gonna get hit in the head by
a brick. Danny the Brick specifically, which

608
00:57:12,298 --> 00:57:19,160
the chief threw. So Rocket's dead too. Geez,
that's animal cruelty. He's an alien animal,

609
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:27,382
right? That's true. Okay, so Robotman has his
upgrades, but suddenly he's feeling something

610
00:57:27,943 --> 00:57:32,384
weird going on with his new inner workings.
Like maybe he had some bad sushi or something.

611
00:57:33,824 --> 00:57:39,138
When suddenly a branch shoots out of his mouth
and his whole body... is going to start bursting

612
00:57:39,338 --> 00:57:45,340
at the rivets and getting wrapped up in vines
as a whole ass tree man grows out from within

613
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:50,561
Robotman's body. That's right, Robotman thought
he blew up Groot, but I'm going to say one

614
00:57:50,581 --> 00:57:56,243
of the twigs survived and made its way inside
Robotman's metal shell, taking him out from

615
00:57:56,263 --> 00:58:01,424
the inside. Groot's back. I love how these plant
creatures just keep coming back. It's awesome.

616
00:58:02,764 --> 00:58:09,598
I'm going to say though that Groot starts feeling
weird. Like he ate some bad whatever the fuck

617
00:58:09,658 --> 00:58:16,680
Groot eats, all right? And he's like, I am Groot.
And that's when his body is torn apart from

618
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:24,222
the inside by Alastewoman, who had shrunk her
body down and squeezed into Groot's body before

619
00:58:24,262 --> 00:58:29,944
expanding and breaking him apart. And I say
no way he has the energy to regrow himself

620
00:58:30,004 --> 00:58:35,905
again for this match. So he's out. Way to be
original with that one. So I got to say about

621
00:58:35,925 --> 00:58:42,224
that. So that happened, that was quite the spectacle
of Robotman dying and then Groot dying. Chief

622
00:58:42,264 --> 00:58:46,947
is watching this happen and all of a sudden
he hears like this whirring sound. Like woo

623
00:58:47,387 --> 00:58:51,769
woo. And he quickly turns around to see where
it's coming from and whack! Sword right through

624
00:58:51,789 --> 00:58:57,192
the neck. Because Gamora threw her sword and
it comes spinning through the air like a saw

625
00:58:57,212 --> 00:59:03,776
blade across the battlefield and just decapitates
the Chief. So he's out and same thing for Elastawoman.

626
00:59:03,896 --> 00:59:10,598
She hears a whirring sound too. dagger to the
face. Gamora is just throwing blades, taking

627
00:59:10,618 --> 00:59:15,760
names. Yeah, but Alastor woman can't really
be injured physically like that. So she's simply

628
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:20,901
going to pull the knife from her face and she's
going to stretch her arms toward Gamora, just

629
00:59:20,941 --> 00:59:26,623
picking her up and lifting her into the sky
as she grows to like skyscraper height. And

630
00:59:26,643 --> 00:59:30,484
then she's just going to drop Gamora. And we're
going to see Gamora's dead body on the ground,

631
00:59:30,644 --> 00:59:35,325
just like an end game. Again, with the originality,
that was the same move that you did in the

632
00:59:35,585 --> 00:59:44,139
Hawk Girl versus Gamora fight. Hey, it's a classic
for a reason. All right. OK, so it's just down

633
00:59:44,179 --> 00:59:50,564
to Mantis and Elastawoman now. I believe so.
Yeah. The bigger they are, the bigger the brain.

634
00:59:51,025 --> 00:59:57,049
So Mantis, like she's going to climb up Elastawoman,
scaling her like a building until she gets

635
00:59:57,089 --> 01:00:02,214
up to her shoulder. And then Mantis is going
to put her hand on the Elastawoman's head that

636
01:00:02,314 --> 01:00:08,226
sends a surge of like psychic pain through her
mind, shutting it down. and causing the last

637
01:00:08,266 --> 01:00:14,628
woman to just drop to the ground into this lifeless
puddle. And guardians win. Except that you

638
01:00:14,648 --> 01:00:19,749
know how you said that Dorothy was tossed toward
the horizon by Gamora? Yes, okay. Well, it

639
01:00:19,769 --> 01:00:24,770
turns out her imaginary friend, flying Robert,
who's like this cherub with a balloon for a

640
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:31,412
head, caught her and dropped her back off at
the battlefield. So Dorothy's back and she

641
01:00:31,452 --> 01:00:36,902
sees that all of her friends are dead, so she's
horrified. And in her distress, She's gonna

642
01:00:36,942 --> 01:00:44,045
emit this like nuclear bomb sized psychic explosion
that's just gonna rock Mantis' mind and kill

643
01:00:44,105 --> 01:00:50,387
her. And Dorothy is gonna go into a coma afterward,
but she's alive at the end. So it counts for

644
01:00:50,547 --> 01:00:54,889
a win for the Doom Patrol. I knew Gamora should
have been a little bit more direct in getting

645
01:00:54,909 --> 01:01:00,691
rid of Dorothy. That's what you get. I'm gonna
say that Dorothy actually isn't horrified when

646
01:01:00,711 --> 01:01:05,753
she returns. She's actually just, you know,
real chill in spite of everything, just calm.

647
01:01:06,294 --> 01:01:11,737
because Mantis empathically calms her down.
And then Mantis is just gonna put Dorothy into

648
01:01:11,777 --> 01:01:18,120
a deep sleep. So either way, Dorothy is in a
coma, but in this case, it's still a guardian's

649
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:24,084
win. And we can leave the match there. Either
Dorothy unleashes a psychic explosion that

650
01:01:24,104 --> 01:01:30,187
shuts down Mantis' mind and then goes into a
coma, or Mantis shuts down Dorothy's mind and

651
01:01:30,227 --> 01:01:34,638
Dorothy still goes into a coma. So we'll find
out which way Dorothy goes into a coma. by

652
01:01:34,718 --> 01:01:40,182
running the stats on all these characters and
coming back with a winner. Let's do it. AJ9K,

653
01:01:40,642 --> 01:01:48,267
run the stats. Inputting data, running calculations,
processing results, simulations complete. All

654
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:55,152
right, poor Dorothy. I feel bad because that's-
She can't break. Yeah, that's how she ended

655
01:01:55,192 --> 01:02:00,496
up passing in the comic books, right? She went
into a coma. Right. But no, I liked the way

656
01:02:00,516 --> 01:02:04,735
that match went. It did end up being pretty
weird. but the team seemed like a good match

657
01:02:04,755 --> 01:02:09,820
for each other. They were an even better match
for each other statistically than I initially

658
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:14,264
suspected. I thought this was actually gonna
be a little bit more lopsided of a match, but

659
01:02:14,404 --> 01:02:20,029
statistically they ended up pretty well balanced.
Right, my most powerful character was crazy

660
01:02:20,149 --> 01:02:24,994
Jane, it turns out. Yeah, and mine was Adam
Warlock. Which wasn't too surprising. Like

661
01:02:25,054 --> 01:02:29,862
I figured he was gonna be your most powerful
guy, but surprisingly, Another one of my most

662
01:02:29,902 --> 01:02:35,223
powerful team members was the Chief. I did not
see that coming actually. Well, that's because

663
01:02:35,243 --> 01:02:40,225
of the versatility stat. By far, the Doom Patrol
was so much more versatile than the Guardians

664
01:02:40,245 --> 01:02:45,766
of the Galaxy. That was the biggest disparity
between the team stats because Chief can do

665
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:51,588
almost anything he puts his mind to. Dorothy
Spinner can summon all sorts of imaginary creatures.

666
01:02:52,068 --> 01:02:58,034
Crazy Jane can turn into so many different types
of super powered beings. Danny the street can

667
01:02:58,094 --> 01:03:02,838
manifest as so many different types of locations.
Like so many of these characters were able

668
01:03:02,858 --> 01:03:07,921
to adapt in so many different ways. Whereas
the guardians were a little bit more, you know,

669
01:03:08,101 --> 01:03:12,484
straightforward in their approach to their powers,
except for Adam Warlock. He was my most versatile

670
01:03:12,825 --> 01:03:17,108
and Rocket Raccoon also had quite a few tricks
up his sleeve. I would say your guys's were

671
01:03:17,148 --> 01:03:24,193
much more weighted in the physical end of the
spectrum. Whereas mine were a little bit more

672
01:03:24,213 --> 01:03:28,930
diverse all over the board. Yeah, actually the
thing that Marvel came out furthest ahead on

673
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:34,852
was fighting skill. A lot of the Guardians of
the Galaxy members are just more adept fighters

674
01:03:34,892 --> 01:03:40,154
like Mantis, Drax, Gamora. They're all well
trained as opposed to the Doom Patrol, which

675
01:03:40,314 --> 01:03:45,835
very few of them have formal hand-to-hand combat
training. In the end, the Guardians individual

676
01:03:45,875 --> 01:03:53,617
win percentages ran anywhere from 35% to 75%
with Drax actually getting the lowest amount

677
01:03:53,637 --> 01:03:58,067
of wins. out of all of his simulations, and
then Adam Warlock winning three-fourths of

678
01:03:58,107 --> 01:04:04,508
his matches. Similarly, Robotman actually had
the lowest win rate out of anyone in Doom Patrol,

679
01:04:04,888 --> 01:04:09,530
whereas Crazy Jane had the highest win rate.
Similarly, Victorious about three-fourths of

680
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:14,991
the time. With all that said, Jonathan, which
of these teams do you think ultimately is going

681
01:04:15,011 --> 01:04:19,513
to end up the victor? I'm really hoping it's
going to be the Doom Patrol. I just really

682
01:04:19,553 --> 01:04:23,526
like the team, but I also know that they're
insanely versatile. I really think that's going

683
01:04:23,546 --> 01:04:29,372
to come through for them in a clinch. Instagram
disagrees with me. Fifty four percent of our

684
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:34,737
poll takers there said that Guardians of the
Galaxy were going to win, to which I just have

685
01:04:34,757 --> 01:04:40,904
to respond. You guys don't watch the Doom Patrol
show and you should be. Why would they when

686
01:04:40,924 --> 01:04:45,788
they can watch the Guardians of the Galaxy movies?
Right? Because that's over. That's it's done.

687
01:04:46,149 --> 01:04:50,468
Get over it. Doom Patrol is over too. Oh, I
guess the last half of the last season hasn't

688
01:04:50,528 --> 01:04:55,692
come out, but that shows over in Dunwith as
well. Yeah, I mean, but not yet. So technically

689
01:04:55,892 --> 01:05:01,476
media-wise, Doom Patrol survived longer. Let's
see if that's the case with this match. AJ

690
01:05:01,516 --> 01:05:08,902
9000, the results please. Hey, Yuasa. All right,
the winner of this team duel between the Doom

691
01:05:08,942 --> 01:05:18,119
Patrol and the Guardians of the Galaxy is Doom
Patrol. Yes, which is bullshit. I got to say,

692
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:22,701
did not see like I totally thought Guardians
had this one in the bag. How the fuck did the

693
01:05:22,761 --> 01:05:27,363
Doom Patrol pull this off? There are a bunch
of freaking losers. OK, that's ableist of you.

694
01:05:27,843 --> 01:05:33,846
Very, very close matchup, though. Doom Patrol
won a whopping five hundred four matches out

695
01:05:33,866 --> 01:05:38,508
of one thousand. So they barely beat the Guardians.
Guardians won four hundred ninety six of the

696
01:05:38,528 --> 01:05:44,264
matches. So it was fifty point four percent
to forty nine. 50.6% overall. This is really

697
01:05:44,385 --> 01:05:51,553
close. That actually surprised me. I don't remember
if this is our closest team duel or not, but

698
01:05:51,613 --> 01:05:58,881
it just might be. It's one of the closer ones.
Wow. 50.4%. Good job Doom Patrol. I mean, considering

699
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:04,507
that Both Doom Patrol and Guardians are probably
the least similar in terms of their rosters.

700
01:06:04,687 --> 01:06:08,888
You know, I would say that something like Justice
League and Avengers are much more similar in

701
01:06:08,908 --> 01:06:12,969
their lineups. But Justice League and Avengers
was a pretty lopsided match. This Doom Patrol

702
01:06:13,009 --> 01:06:18,091
Guardians one is not. So I don't know. That's
just interesting how some of the stuff plays

703
01:06:18,171 --> 01:06:22,512
out. Just means that we and the executive producers
did a great job picking this match. Yeah, it

704
01:06:22,532 --> 01:06:27,053
was a lot of fun really looking forward to our
next match, which I believe is going to be

705
01:06:27,253 --> 01:06:32,832
the Legion of Doom. versus the Masters of Evil.
So another Doom team. Yeah, if by Doom you

706
01:06:32,852 --> 01:06:39,936
mean dumb, sure. Yeah, another dumb team. What?
I don't know what I'm saying. All right, let's

707
01:06:39,976 --> 01:06:44,358
