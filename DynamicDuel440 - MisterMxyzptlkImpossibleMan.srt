00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,680
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi, welcome to
the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,780
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,440
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin

4
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,820
brother Marvelous Joe. And in this episode we are
doing a duel between the Superman villain, Mister

5
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:50,040
Mxyzptlk, and the Fantastic Four villain,
Impossible Man. Yeah, they're both impish

6
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:56,440
characters who are insanely powerful. They
actually had a crossover in the Superman Silver

7
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,640
Surfer pop one-shot issue, but we're here to fully
settle the debate who would win between these two

8
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,000
characters no holds barred. Right, because that
ended in a stalemate. And we don't play like that.

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,580
There's not gonna be any Superman or Silver Surfer
to save Mister Mxyzptlk's ass this time. Or

10
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,620
Impossible Man. But before that we're gonna break
down the comic book and movie news from the past

11
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:23,440
week, which you know we're not because once again
there is no comic book movie news worth talking

12
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,040
about. Yeah, what's up with this drought that
we're in right now? You think as we're gearing up to

13
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,480
the Superman and Fantastic Four films and the Iron
Heart show that there'd be more news going around?

14
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:39,460
Well I figured that Superman and Fantastic Four
would be having final trailers soon to kind of say

15
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:44,520
hey tickets are now on sale but Fantastic Four
jumped the gun and put their tickets on sale before

16
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,380
even having a final trailer. And I'm like what?
That reminds me I gotta buy my tickets. Wait, you

17
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,340
don't have your tickets yet? Fake fan. I'm getting
them. I'm gonna get them right now actually. So

18
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:59,860
just keep talking while I do that. So I don't know if
you guys know this but Marvel sucks big time. Let me

19
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:05,180
tell you why. Not only do they put their tickets out
without releasing a final trailer like who does

20
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:13,120
that but also what are you doing? You told me to keep
talking. I may continue on with the episode. Oh,

21
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,440
okay. Now go on to an editorial. Got you. Alright.
Well as always we list our segment times in our

00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:27,880
John and Dean simulate battles between popular

35
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:34,520
they pit Cloud Strife from Vinyl Fantasy versus
Ike from Fire Emblem. Over on the Max Destruction

36
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:40,020
podcast hosts Scotty and Gilly pit your favorite

D. Grayman versus Tokia Mikagami from Flame of
Reka. Visit dynamicpodcasts.com or click the

00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,680

in the Dino Mike podcast network. But with that out

42
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,880
of the way quick to the no prize. A no prize is an
award Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version

43
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,940
the Dynamic Dual no prize is a digital award that we
post on Instagram for the person that we feel gave

44
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:28,080
the best answer to our question of the week. Last
week we asked you guys how did you find Dynamic Dual

45
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,080
and how long have you been listening to the show.
And this is coming off with the news that Jonathan

46
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:41,100
and I will be ending this podcast in January of 2026
as it currently exists. Basically it's not going

47
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,060
to be a weekly show anymore because Jonathan and I
have been doing this for 10 years. We started on our

48
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,120
30th birthday and we thought our 40th birthday
would be a good time to retire the show. So we're

49
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,700
going to stop doing weekly episodes but we're
still going to review the latest Marvel and DC

50
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,580
comic book movies that come out to theaters
because we want to retain our Rotten Tomatoes

51
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:08,180
credentials as critics. So basically this was a
horrible question though because there was no way

52
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:14,980
we could pick an answer. So this week there are no
honorable mentions and there's really no winner.

53
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,760
We appreciate everyone who called in and we're
going to play all of your answers because you guys

54
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:24,720
are all winners. Yeah everyone's a winner. You get
a no prize and you get a no prize and you get a no

55
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,420
prize. Let's go ahead and hear from the callers
starting with Cyrus Moore who said hey guys. Cyrus

56
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:37,200
Moore I found you guys in 2019. I was in a pretty low
place and I was just going through Spotify trying

57
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:45,780
to find a DC podcast that would tickle my fancy and I
just happened to stumble upon you guys and I've

58
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:52,120
just been listening every day since 2019 and
haven't missed an episode and I love you guys and

59
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:57,400
thank you for always making a great show. I
appreciate it. Not going to lie one of the most

60
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:03,100
heartwarming things about doing this podcast is
hearing feedback like this where we helped bring

61
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:08,460
some kind of joy to someone's life. Yeah and he
jumped in at the right time too because 2019 is when

62
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:14,100
the show probably started getting good. It took us
a few years of trying to nail this formula before we

63
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,900
finally got it. And not saying this show is good. It
could be better. It could be better. It can always

64
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:24,960
be better. Mostly by this year we'll nail it. Yeah.
Year 10 is our year. Year 10 is when the show really

65
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:32,680
gets good. Finally. Thanks Cyrus more. Our next
answer comes from Lorenzo Valdez who said this is

66
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,160
Lorenzo Valdez calling in once again. I've
actually only been listening to your podcast for

67
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:43,980
the last couple of months. I think I found out about
your podcast via an advertisement that you guys

68
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:54,580
had on one of DC's new official podcasts either DC
studio showcase or DC high volume Batman. Clon of

69
00:06:54,580 --> 00:07:02,100
forever and always. Yeah the podcast that he heard
an ad for us on was DC high volume. DC's reps reached

70
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:08,920
out to us and wanted to promote that show on our
podcast and also let us promote our show on theirs

71
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:15,880
which has happened a couple of times like Marvel's
Wolverine podcast the Long Nights also did that.

72
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,840
Yeah we've been pretty lucky over the years to hear
from reps from Marvel and DC themselves

73
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,500
specifically within the podcast space. But all
I'm saying is we actually got listeners from the DC

74
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:32,140
one. Thanks Lorenzo. The next caller is Eli who
said this is Eli and I've been listening since

75
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:39,620
March of 2020. You guys got me through the pandemic
and straight through high school but when the

76
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:45,080
pandemic started I got kicked out of school and
started looking and so I needed something to

77
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,780
listen to during my nine hour shifts at the
warehouse. So I blew through all you guys's

78
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:55,920
previous episodes pretty quick and started
listening to the weekly uploads. The pandemic

79
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:01,440
year 2020 when that all started I wasn't even sure
this podcast was going to survive everything that

80
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,440
was going on then just because everything was
really weird and we managed to get through that

81
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:11,280
year largely by just reviewing older Marvel and DC
films which thankfully there was a large backlog

82
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,220
of content for us to look at because we know that
Marvel and DC weren't putting out anything new at

83
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:19,160
that time. So yeah a lot of listeners found us
during that time when a lot of people were

84
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,860
listening to podcasts. Yeah and you and I actually
started recording separately around that time

85
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:29,420
because for a long time we were recording in the
same room. Right but then like everybody else you

86
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,760
know we started hopping on zoom calls and stuff to
collaborate. Great answer Eli our next answer

87
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:40,780
comes from CJ Kraft who said. Hey guys CJ Kraft here
I've been listening so long I'm not sure when I

88
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:46,740
started. I know it was around the show's beginning
because it was before the first retooling. I can't

89
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,980
believe it's already been 10 years every Tuesday
the entertainment's been top notch. I don't know

90
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,500
what I'm going to do with you guys gone. You'll be
missed but I'll look forward to the episodes we do

91
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:02,740
get. Thanks guys. Yeah CJ Kraft is one of our
original listeners I think he's been with us for a

92
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,920
long time and he's reached out time and again and
we've been looking enough to hear from him because

93
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,220
he's a talented writer and we promoted some of his
books on this podcast as well. Yeah for anyone who

94
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,260
hasn't listened to the show from the very start
when CJ is talking about the retooling he's

95
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:22,000
talking about our first year where we were
actually a bi-weekly show and we called ourselves

96
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,780
the DC Marvel Battlecast. That's right yeah
that's real old school. Thanks CJ our next answer

97
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:36,080
comes from Alex Albrough who said. Hey guys found
you in early 2023 when I was having to drive a lot and

98
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,140
I had a Marvel podcast I liked and was looking for a
DC podcast to learn more about those characters.

99
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,160
Found this one where I could learn about both and
imaginary battles between the two and got hooked

100
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,000
pretty instantly. I went through your whole
library except for movies and shows I haven't seen

101
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:55,060
yet in about a year and a half and now I'm all caught
up and look forward to listening every Tuesday.

102
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:01,860
Congrats on the podcast guys and happy early early
40th birthday. I do not want to turn 40 so everybody

103
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,060
just hold off on their birthday wishes for now. I am
not looking forward to that actually I've already

104
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:13,740
started telling people that I'm 40 because I might
as well be you know 39 really you're 40. Thanks for

105
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:19,800
listening Alex and thanks for your answer our next
answer comes from Matt from Texas. Hey guys Matt

106
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:24,540
from Texas. The first time I heard about your
podcast was on the TV a movie trivia podcast with

107
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:32,060
Brian Sheehan where Joe was a special guest for the
Captain America first Avengers back in 2022. I

108
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:37,020
jumped over here that was about a year and a half ago
and just started listening and binged through

109
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:43,560
every single one of your episodes and have loved
every single one of them. Good job guys. Yeah Brian

110
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:50,540
has had me on his TV and movie trivia podcast as a
guest for about four or five episodes I think and

111
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:56,600
I've had a blast every time. I haven't gone on his
show for a few months now maybe almost a year so I got

112
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,680
a remedy that I'll have to reach out to him again
because I really love his podcast and he has great

113
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:08,520
trivia questions and he's a really cool dude. I was
on his podcast in the fall of last year as sort of a

114
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:15,240
tie into the Joker sequel that was coming out. We
did trivia on the first Joker movie and you could

115
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:21,760
see how hyped I was for the Joker sequel and I feel
like the episode is very dated now because of how

116
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:28,200
bad the Joker sequel actually was. I gotta go back
and listen to it and just laugh at all of your

117
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,540
misplaced enthusiasm. Thanks for the call Matt.
Our next answer comes from Christian Robito who

118
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,620
said, Hey y'all it's Christian Robito. I've been
listening to this podcast for about two or three

119
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:42,720
years now. My favorite part of this podcast has
definitely been the dual episodes. It's been fun

120
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,780
listening to fictional fights between
characters that we all love. I especially love the

121
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,940
banter between you two. It's been fun to hear but
really this podcast has just been a good way to tune

122
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:56,100
out from the real world and all the stress and
everything that entails and just have fun

123
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,980
listening to nerdy stuff. Thanks for everything.
Y'all hope to hear from you soon. Yeah, I'm not sure

124
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:07,140
which episodes I prefer creating the duels or the
reviews. I know this podcast started with duels

125
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,840
because you and I have been arguing about these
characters fighting since we were little kids but

126
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:17,880
being film critics has also been a dream of ours
also since we were younger. Right. I think it

127
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:22,060
depends on what episode we're currently doing.
Like if we're currently doing a dual episode, I

128
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,140
think man, I can't wait to get to a review and when
we're doing a review, I think man, I can't wait to

129
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:31,500
get to a duel. So it's been a nice balance of having
both formats available. We're doing a lot of duels

130
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,180
this year just trying to do every single character
under the sun and I'm actually really enjoying it.

131
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:42,680
It's a lot of work but it's always fun to do. Thanks
Christian. Our next color was Rysiel. Who said?

132
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,440
Hey guys, this is Rysiel. I've been listening to
you guys for apparently like nine years now

133
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,180
because I remember starting like right around
when you guys started. I found you guys on

134
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,880
accident. I'm just sick of listening to music
sometimes while I'm sitting at work. So I just

135
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,320
started searching for something nerdy,
something DC related and you guys are the only one I

136
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,080
listened to that doesn't sound like the comic book
nerd like, oh actually. So yeah, that's about it.

137
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,320
See you. Well, Jonathan still sounds like that. I
think that's fair. But actually, have you noticed

138
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:15,500
that a lot of these colors are saying that they were
searching for a DC podcast when they found this and

139
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,700
not a Marvel podcast? Well, yeah, I mean, Marvel
has a lot of fans. So there's a lot more Marvel

140
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:26,600
podcasts and DC fans are kind of like solitary
figures who don't really go out at night or put

141
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:32,100
together podcasts. So they're harder to come by.
I'm sorry DC has some amazing podcasts. You don't

142
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:37,680
know what the fuck you're talking about. Way to
profile DC fans. I will profile DC fans all day

143
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:43,140
long. Okay, want to hear my profile of a Marvel fan?
Nope. Too bad because you're going to hear it.

144
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:49,380
Marvel fans are stupid. They're just really dumb.
Why did you use the thesaurus for that one? They are

145
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:56,800
ignoramuses. Thanks for calling in Rizio. Our
penultimate answer comes from Brian Rochester.

146
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:05,400
Who said? Hi, it's Brian. I found Dynamic Dual by
Random Searching for different podcasts about

147
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:16,720
Marvel and DC. And I think the first episode I
listened to was the iVampire versus... I don't

148
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:24,480
forgot about the vampires, but it's been a great
show. Yeah, that was Andrew Bennett iVampire

149
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,280
versus Dracula. It was Marvel's version of
Dracula. We put that out in October of 2023 as kind

150
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:37,460
of like a spooky October Vampire Dual episode. I
still contend that Andrew Bennett is the absolute

151
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:43,040
worst name for a vampire and a DC character in
general. It's just a fucking name. Andrew

152
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:49,320
Bennett. So dumb. Well, as compared to something
like Niko Minoru? Yeah, at least that's like

153
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,000
unique and cool sounding. Niko Minoru will
straight up stab your ass. Andrew Bennett will

154
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,500
sell you flood insurance. What is Blade's real
name again? Eric Brooks. That's wild because that

155
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:07,440
is the exact name of my accountant. Touche.
Touche. Well, I mean at least he has the name Blade,

156
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,980
which is still better than iVampire. Thanks for
the call, Brian. Our final answer comes from our

157
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:18,120
friends at Max Destruction, twins Scotty and
Gilly. Who said? Scotty Macho here. Gilly Macho

158
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:24,280
here. Max Destruction. I want to say my favorite
episode you guys didn't air because I want to bet

159
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:31,060
against Gil when you did the stats for me against
Martian Manhunter versus Vision and DC Guys Won.

160
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:37,660
Sorry, I got my bet back when we did Century versus
Zod and I won. Yeah, so we're listening to you guys

161
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:43,300
for five to six years now and it's sad to see you guys
go from the battles, but at least we still have the

162
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:48,900
movie reviews. And at least we still have Max
Destruction with your guys's dope episodes.

163
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:53,420
Yeah, I'm really looking forward to this week's
The Tick versus Goliath Dual episode because

164
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:58,780
Jonathan and I watched both of those cartoons
growing up as kids. You guys do great. I think you

165
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:03,880
kind of stole our whole stick when it comes to twins
talking about versus battles, but we'll let it

166
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:09,080
slide because you guys are awesome. Also real
quick, I'm confused because we actually did do a

167
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:13,780
Martian Manhunter versus Vision episode. Yeah, I
think you said that maybe we didn't air it, but

168
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:18,820
yeah, that was an episode back in like 2018, I want
to say. I do want to give a special shout out to

169
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:25,140
Spider Frank who left us a message on Spotify
comments who wrote, I've been listening since

170
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:31,260
2016 when I was 12 years old and now that I'm 21, it
feels like I'm losing a great friend. I'll dearly

171
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:36,180
miss the dual episodes, my favorite part of the
show and over the years, I forgot to say thank you.

172
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,320
I'm not crying, you're crying, right? Fucking
gutted from that answer. Thank you so much, Spider

173
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:46,340
Frank, for writing to us. That answer hurts on
multiple levels because I feel bad that the show is

174
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:52,440
ending in January, but also I feel bad because you
were 12 years old when you started listening and

175
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:58,260
now you're old enough to drink, so we have been
doing this for a while. Those are all the answers

176
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:02,340
and now that we've gone through all of them, I hope
it didn't seem like a big circle jerk on behalf of

177
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:07,180
Jonathan and myself, but we truly wanted to
spotlight the people who took the time to give us a

178
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:12,420
call and leave such touching answers. It means a
lot to us and we can't wait to continue making

179
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:16,660
episodes for you guys throughout the rest of this
year because like we said last time, we got some

180
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:22,300
good ones in the works, including this Mr. Mixi
Spitalik vs. Impossible Man dual episode, but

181
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:31,820
speaking of duels, that brings us to our question
of the week. What Marvel or DC character that we

182
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:38,500
haven't done a duel with yet, are you still hoping
we get to by January? We've done so many

183
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:43,840
characters, but we're looking specifically for
characters that we have not done duels with. Yeah,

184
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:49,100
just a reminder that the calendar is already set by
our executive producers, but we're interested in

185
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:54,420
seeing how much that calendar aligns with
listener expectations. Recording an answer at

Dual No Prize that we'll post to Instagram. Be sure

190
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:26,220
to answer before June 14th. But now it's time for
the main event of this episode, where we pit the

191
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:48,700
nigh-impetent imp characters of Mr. Mxyz
Spitalik vs. Impossible Man. Okay, Mr. Mxyz

192
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:55,040
Spitalik vs. Impossible Man. I think I'm saying
Mxyz's name right. I've heard a number of

193
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,080
different ways, but that's the pronunciation I
remember from the Superman 90s cartoon, in which

194
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:05,380
Mxyz made a few appearances voiced by Gilbert
Godfrey. Yeah, Impossible Man has made a few

195
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,960
appearances in Marvel cartoons as well. I'm
wondering if we should just refer to the

196
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:15,240
characters as Mxyz and Impey as Impossible Man is
sometimes known in the comic books from here on out

197
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:19,960
for this episode, because it is really hard to say
in Mr. Mxyz Spitalik. Oh yeah, no, I'm totally fine

198
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:24,760
with that. He's often referred to as Mxyz in the
comics. Or is that too cutesy for these two badass

199
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,960
characters? I guess they're not really badass.
They're both jokesters, right? They both like to

200
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,780
play pranks. They both like to have fun. Although I
always say that Mr. Mxyz Spitalik is a little bit

201
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:40,840
more devious in his pranks than Impossible Man is.
Yeah, Mxyz is definitely a villain in DC. He's

202
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:46,020
sometimes partnered with the good guys, but it's
pretty rare. Now Mxyz has also had several

203
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:52,340
live-action appearances in Smallville and the
Supergirl television series. I'm guessing we've

204
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:57,980
never seen Impossible Man in live-action. No, we
have not yet. He's kind of ridiculous looking. He

205
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:04,800
kind of looks like a pickle. He looks like Pickle
Rick. I'm Pickle Rick! Now, to explain the

206
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:11,180
methodology behind our duels, let's go to our
sentient duel simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000.

207
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:17,660
AJ9K, tell our listeners how you go about
determining a winner in our duel matchups. Yes, of

208
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:22,620
course, sir. The way I determine a winner between
the contestants is by running 1000 Monte Carlo

209
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:28,020
simulations using the characters statistics. A
Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic model

210
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:32,740
used to determine outcomes through random
sampling. In this case, I randomize the

211
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:37,680
statistics along a normal distribution as a way to
simulate the many variables that can occur during

212
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,640
battle. The stat parameters are based on the
official Marvel power grid from which the DC

213
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,280
characters statistics are extrapolated.
Additional stat categories are included such as

214
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,820
range, damage potential, versatility and
perception in order to create a more detailed and

215
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:58,160
accurate simulation. The results of the 1000
simulations provide a percentage of wins for each

216
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:02,760
character. The contestant with the higher
percentage is declared the victor as they have a

217
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:08,040
higher probability to win any given battle. In an
equitable pairing, neither character should win

218
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:13,380
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat

219
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,840
Superman, so the confidence rate of my method
falls in line with the precedents that have been

220
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,700
established in the source material. My
mathematical simulations are without

221
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:27,260
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for

222
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:32,880
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K.
Before we run the simulations though, we'd like to

223
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,480
break down each character's histories and
abilities before improvising a scenario on how we

224
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,440
imagine one of the 1000 simulations would play out
beat for beat. And I believe it's my turn to go first

225
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,960
with the Marvel character backstory, so let me
tell you guys all about Impossible Man. Born on the

226
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:55,800
perilous world of pop-up in the 10th galaxy, the
alien later dubbed Impossible Man belonged to a

227
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,400
communal species whose members shared a single
group mind and could instantly rearrange every

228
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,220
molecule of their bodies into any form their
imaginations conceived. Restless after

229
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,900
millennia of surviving lethal predators, an
adventurous pop-upian transformed himself into

230
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:16,280
a starship and rocketed to Earth soon after the
Fantastic Four's debut. Landing in New York City,

231
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:21,940
he robbed a bank simply to buy lunch, then
delighted in outmaneuvering police, soldiers,

232
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,460
and the Fantastic Four. The thing called him
impossible, and the giddy visitor adopted the

233
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:32,640
nickname on the spot. Mr. Fantastic eventually
realized the prankster craved attention. When

234
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:38,000
every New Yorker agreed to ignore him, he declared
the planet intolerably dull and blasted off in

235
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,300
search of fresh amusement. You can learn more
about the Fantastic Four and their duel against

236
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:47,720
the Justice Society. He returned years later and
lured the planet-debouring Galactus away from

237
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:53,020
Earth by offering pop-up itself as sustenance.
The collective consciousness of its people

238
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,760
accepted the sacrifice reasoning that their
culture would endure within Impossible Man their

239
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,900
most adventurous emissary. Galactus consumed
the hyper-adaptive world but suffered

240
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:09,120
near-fatal indigestion, leaving Impossible Man
the lone living vessel of pop-up's mind. Inviting

241
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,920
himself aboard the Fantastic Four's craft, he
accompanied them home, determined to make Earth

242
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,760
his playground. Almost immediately, he stormed
into the fictional offices of Marvel Comics

243
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:24,320
demanding a series dedicated to his exploits. A
hasty promise from editor Stan Lee averted

244
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,700
disaster, and the trickster moved on to
impersonate the newly inaugurated US president,

245
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:35,020
foiling an assassination scheme involving mind
control technology and the cyborg deathlock.

246
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,720
Taking up temporary residence in the Baxter
building, he was ambushed by Klaw and the Molecule

247
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,320
Man. Recovering mid-battle, he proved immune to
sonic vibration and molecular manipulation once

248
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:50,820
he anticipated them and helped free the Fantastic
Four after Molecule Man possessed Reed Richards.

249
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:55,840
Concluding that the team took life far too
seriously, he drifted to Hollywood and gleefully

250
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,880
disrupted multiple film shoots until boredom
again set in. Back in New York, he visited The Thing

251
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:07,240
and sculptor Alicia Masters. Their obvious
affection inspired him to split his own essence

252
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:12,880
and create a companion, Impossible Woman.
Following Reed and Sue's example, the couple soon

253
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:18,440
produced thousands of Impossible Kids. Domestic
squabbles over who should lead the family erupted

254
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:24,260
into an intergalactic scavenger hunt. On Earth,
Impossible Man confiscated the X-Men's Mansion,

255
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:29,840
Nick Fury's eye patch, Zabu the Sabertooth Tiger,
Doctor Strange's Skylight, Iron Man's prototype

256
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:35,420
armor, and other trophies before the X-Men,
backed by Shiar and Pres LaLondra, forced the

257
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:41,140
Impossible Family to return every item and
apologize before a tribunal of alien races.

258
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:45,800
Determined to restore his bruised ego,
Impossible Man revisited the X-Mansion but found

259
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:51,420
only the teenage new mutants. Their techno
organic teammate Warlock accepted his challenge

260
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:57,140
to a global shape-changing duel that tore across
Manhattan's docks, Rio's beaches, London's

261
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:03,340
rooftops, Moscow's spires, and Tokyo's streets.
Warlock finally triumphed by altering his own

262
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:08,660
coloration, something a pop-upian could not
duplicate, prompting Impossible Man to storm

263
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:14,180
back into space. While evading a war fleet from the
planet Ergonar, he irritated the solemn silver

264
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:18,880
surfer, insisting that Harold find a sense of
humor, and secretly followed him during a

265
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:24,360
confrontation with the death-worshipping Titan
Thanos. Convinced that cosmic levity might just

266
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,440
yet save the day, the prankster eventually
departed in search of easier sport. Family Duty

267
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:35,780
resurfaced when Impossible Woman demanded a
summer vacation on Earth for their 4682

268
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,900
offspring. They scattered around the globe to
sightsee, Impossible Man pestered Spider-Man

269
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:46,360
during a stakeout, impersonated occult tomes
inside Doctor Strange's Sanctum and briefly

270
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:51,880
became the Punisher's Rifle before pying the
vigilante in the face. A chaotic day at an

271
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:57,760
amusement park ended with Childe number 4682
missing, sending Impossible Man to consult the

272
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,320
Watcher on the Moon, scour the Microverse, and
stir up Asgard, where Queen Frigga halted the

273
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,960
commotion with a royal spanking. The youngster
was finally located fronting a rock band, and the

274
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,900
Relied Family launched a galaxy-wide concert
tour. Left to his own devices, Once More

275
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:18,610
Impossible Man infiltrated a supervillain poker
game at the infamous DynaMic's villain hangout,

276
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:24,250
The Bar With No Name, and disguised himself as an
extra ace of spades, igniting a brawl among the

277
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:28,970
hardened criminals. Feeling slighted when the
Hulk's friend Rick Jones failed to invite him to a

278
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:34,190
wedding, he mailed invitations to disgruntled
villains and rival alien empires, transforming

279
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:39,970
the ceremony into chaos. Later impossible man
badgered Cable and his ex-force team during their

280
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:45,770
island vacation into mentoring three of his
apathetic, impossible teens. However, the kids

281
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:50,970
stayed glued to their hollow screens instead of
training until a colossal crustacean burst from

282
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:56,210
the lagoon and swatted their father clear through
a cliff. The shock of seeing impossible man

283
00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:01,490
injured finally spurred them to fight alongside
the ex-force and after helping subdue the beast,

284
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:06,950
they teleported off, calling themselves
Impossible X, clad in pouches and straps tactical

285
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:12,550
gear pad or doctor cables. You can learn more about
ex-force in their duel against the outsiders.

286
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:16,890
Returning to Earth under the guise of the Silver
Surfer, Impossible man warned of the parasitic

287
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:22,110
Homojian, aliens who merged with native
populations. During the battle, he was

288
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:28,290
vaporized, reforming in sight Spider-Man's
lungs as microscopic vapor that Spidey vomited

289
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:33,890
into a towering Papupian conglomerate that
separated the parasites from their hosts. The

290
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:38,070
Fantastic Four negotiated a compromise with the
Homojian that transplanted into the new

291
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:44,450
exhaustible Papupian biomass and the fused race
left peacefully. Later Impossible man was in a

292
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:47,990
Himalayan village suffering from hiccups that
were triggering uncontrollable

293
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:52,910
transformations. A visit from the Thing was able
to frighten the hiccups away after which

294
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:57,750
Impossible man attended Grimm's long-delayed
Bar Mitzvah. Seeking profit, he partnered with

295
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:02,870
the showman assassin Arcade to market
self-morphing toys made from his own tissue, but

296
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:07,810
switched sides when those toys attacked the human
torch. You can learn more about Arcade in his duel

297
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:13,230
against the Riddler. During a reality-rending
uprising led by the Japanese death god Amatsumi

298
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:19,370
Kaboshi, Impossible man tried to distract the
deity with slapstick forms but was unraveled into

299
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:24,610
nothingness, yet his intangible consciousness
soon recovered. Observing a later clash between

300
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:30,930
Hulk, Red Hulk, and the telepathic Titan Xemnu,
Impossible man used a Valizian compounder to fuse

301
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:36,410
the two hulks into a single behemoth so they could
defeat Xemnu before separating them. Paternal

302
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:41,210
concern returned when Impossible man implored
Mr. Fantastic's science organization known as

303
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:48,150
the Future Foundation to educate his introverted
genius son, whom he lamented was far too possible.

304
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:51,950
In exchange, Impossible man supplied the
Foundation with intelligence on the time lost

305
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:57,590
Fantastic Four. He later celebrated with the
reunited Richards family on the moon. Most

306
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:01,390
recently, while on a journey of
self-improvement, Impossible man attempted to

307
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:07,110
master the creed discipline of Zen fascist yoga
within the Dark Dimension. His meditation

308
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:12,970
destabilized multiple realities until Doctor
Strange and Beast persuaded him to desist,

309
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:17,570
whereupon he departed once more for parts
unknown. And that's Impossible man.

310
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:23,370
Powers-wise, Impossible man is of the Papupian
race, giving him the innate ability to rearrange

311
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:28,750
and convert the molecules of his body into
anything, mimicking most of their properties.

312
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:34,070
This includes the ability to separate himself for
the purposes of self-duplication or manifesting

313
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:39,670
separate entities. He can increase or decrease
his mass between beings the size of Galactus or

314
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:45,770
down to the microscopic. He can also use his
molecular shifting power to fly, teleport, and

315
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:51,310
even produce energy or force. One drawback of
Impossible man's power is that he traditionally

316
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:57,630
can't alter his color outside of his green-purple
scheme across the tonal spectrum. When he uses his

317
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:03,870
power to shift his form or teleport, it produces a
loud pop sound. And that is the Impossible man.

318
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:10,870
Wait, so you're telling me that Impossible man is
not a reality warper? No, but through his powers he

319
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:15,570
can mimic a lot of other abilities, even things
that you wouldn't think that shape-changing

320
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:22,470
could accomplish, like telekinesis. One time he
pretended to be magneto and was able to simulate

321
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:28,730
his powers of magnetism. Essentially, I believe
by reducing offshoots of his own matter into

322
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:34,510
molecules that could affect other matter. The
dude sounds more like Martian Manhunter than

323
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:41,050
Mixie. Not gonna lie. Impossible man is not only
far more durable than Martian Manhunter because

324
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:46,930
he's not a fucking wuss when it comes to fire, but
also his molecular shape-shifting ability is far

325
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:51,550
more versatile. I'll just say this now. I don't
think it's going to be versatile enough because

326
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:57,710
Mixie Spindelik I think is way more powerful. Let
me get into his backstory. Mr. Mixie Spindelik

327
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:03,630
hails from the fifth dimension, a plane of reality
so advanced that its inhabitants and technology

328
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:10,030
appear as magic to those in the third dimension.
Though a being of immense power, Mixie adopted the

329
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:15,550
appearance of a mischievous imp, a diminutive
figure often dressed in eccentric attire,

330
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:21,650
including a bowler hat and outlandish colors.
Drawn to Earth out of sheer curiosity and a desire

331
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:27,270
for amusement, Mixie took a particular interest
in Superman, whose sense of justice and order

332
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:32,550
stood in stark contrast to Mixie's chaos and
whimsy. You can learn more about Superman in our

333
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:38,790
Superman vs. Dr. Doom episode. On Earth 2, Mixie
Spindelik plagued Superman with unpredictable

334
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:44,430
tricks and reality-altering antics, defying the
laws of physics and common sense using fifth

335
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:50,090
dimensional technology. Incapable of defeating
Mixie through conventional means, Superman

336
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:55,110
discovered that saying Mixie Spindelik's name
backward would banish him to the fifth dimension

337
00:31:55,110 --> 00:32:01,690
for a mandatory period of 90 days. This became a
recurring tactic in their confrontations with

338
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:07,690
Mixie always returning once the banishment
window expired. On Earth 1, a new incarnation of

339
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:13,630
Mixie Spindelik emerged, targeting Superman
both in Metropolis and retroactively during his

340
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:18,950
youth as Superboy in Smallville. In one
encounter, Superman turned the tables by

341
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:24,370
entering the fifth dimension himself, where
Mixie was running for mayor. Despite Mixie's

342
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:30,450
attempt to trap Superman there by tricking him
into saying Namropus or Superman backwards,

343
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:37,250
Superman escaped by saying Lelac, his Kryptonian
name spelled backward. The imp's last notable

344
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:41,710
appearance before the Crisis on Infinite Earths
occurred was when he revealed himself as the

345
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:48,150
mastermind behind Superman's recent adversity.
Claiming boredom after millennia of impishness,

346
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:53,750
Mixie chose to embrace true malevolence, using
his power to empower other villains and ensnare

347
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:59,910
the fortress of solitude. Upon being discovered,
he took on a grotesque true form that caused pain in

348
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:04,770
others to behold. When Superman accidentally
banished him to the Phantom Zone while Mixie

349
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:09,210
Spindelik said his name backward, the
dimensional collision tore the imp apart.

350
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:15,030
Distraught over causing Mixie's death, Superman
depowered himself using gold kryptonite and

351
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:21,510
retired. Following the multiversal reset, Mixie
remained a reality-defying trickster, though

352
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:25,850
was revealed to be a sane psychological
researcher from the fifth dimension who came to

353
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:31,890
Earth to study human behavior. Initially
rational and curious, repeated exposure to the

354
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:37,130
three Stooges films warped his mind and
transformed him into the maniac being known as

355
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:42,570
Mixie Spindelik. At one point, Mixie visited the
Joker for advice on how to better torment

356
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:50,090
Superman. The Joker tricked the imp into giving up
99.9% of his power, allowing the Joker to gain

357
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:56,050
control over reality itself and reshape the world
into a grotesque nightmare. Rendered nearly

358
00:33:56,050 --> 00:34:02,470
powerless, Mixie wandered Metropolis in a daze
until he recovered enough sanity to aid Superman

359
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:08,690
and Steel in escaping Earth and confronting the
Joker. With assistance from the Spectre, Mixie

360
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:13,370
helped reverse the damage and restore the world.
You can learn more about the Joker and his duel

361
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:19,170
against the Green Goblin. Later, Mixie was
captured and imprisoned by the deranged Superboy

362
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:25,590
Prime, who sought to use the imp's power to
recreate Earth Prime. The ritual failed due to the

363
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:32,210
sacrifice of a heroic sorceress named Anathas
Arathas. Though Mixie tried to save her, he

364
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:37,170
respected her decision to atone through death. It
was during this time that he cryptically revealed

365
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:43,710
that over the ages, he had assumed many names
familiar to Earth mythology, including Loki and

366
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:51,030
Anansi. In post-Flashpoint continuity, Mixie's
presence was initially subtle. His wife, Nixleic

367
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:57,010
Spitlands, known as Mrs. Nixley, mentioned him
during her own appearances, noting that he had

368
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:02,230
fallen into a coma following a catastrophic
battle with their former court Chester, Lord

369
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:07,670
Vendictavix. In this new continuity, it was
revealed that Mixie was actually a traveling

370
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:13,630
entertainer who performed illusions for the King
of Xerph, charming both the monarch and Princess

371
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:19,890
Nixley. Jealous of the attention Mixie received,
Vendictavix attempted to assassinate him. The

372
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:26,850
attempt went awry and the King was killed instead.
Enraged, Vendictavix chased Mixie and Nixley

373
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:32,030
into the third dimension. On Earth, the couple
disguised themselves as humans and lived in

374
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:38,930
Metropolis. Mixie, performing as Mr. XXX, even
fathered a child before succumbing to an

375
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:44,210
Earth-based illness that placed him in a coma.
When Superman defeated Vendictavix's final

376
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:50,190
attack, Mixie awakened, suggesting that he had
faith in Superman's victory all along, though

377
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:55,770
whether this was sincere or a deeper part of an
elaborate ruse remained unclear. Later, Mixie

378
00:35:55,770 --> 00:36:01,690
was revealed to be a captive of a mysterious figure
known as Mr. Oz, who was later revealed to be

379
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:07,850
Superman's birth father, Jor-El. Mixie believed
Superman would rescue him, though over time grew

380
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:14,230
embittered when no help came. Freaking himself,
he confronted Superman, Lois, and their son,

381
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:19,670
Jonathan, unaware that they were from
pre-Flashpoint continuity. Once he realized the

382
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:24,790
truth, he fused them with their post-Flashpoint
counterparts and retreated to the fifth

383
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:31,550
dimension, expressing fear that a greater being,
likely Dr. Manhattan, was hunting him. Later,

384
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:36,210
Mixie was contacted telepathically by Martian
Manhunter and Starman to assist the Justice

385
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:41,950
League during a sixth-dimensional, multiversal
crisis. Tricked into believing his 90-day

386
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:48,170
banishment had ended, Mixie arrived on Earth
unleashing havoc. However, he agreed to help,

387
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:53,450
once informed that the source walls collapsed
through and the entire multiverse including the

388
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:58,450
fifth dimension itself. Using his power, he
opened a portal to the sixth dimension for

389
00:36:58,450 --> 00:37:03,390
Superman, explaining he had imbued Superman with
fifth-dimensional energy from their earliest

390
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:09,550
encounters. After Superman and others departed,
Mixie began erasing parts of the city until

391
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:15,690
another fifth-dimensional imp, the Batman
superfan known as Batmite, and the Legion of Doom,

392
00:37:15,690 --> 00:37:22,030
intervened and subdued him. And that's Mixie's
backstory. Power-wise, Mr. Mixie Spitalik

393
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:28,110
possesses nigh-imnipotent abilities derived
from the laws of the fifth dimension, granting him

394
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:34,610
total control over reality in the third and fourth
dimensions. His powers allowed him to bend,

395
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:40,910
alter, or ignore the laws of time, space, matter,
and energy at will. He could conjure objects from

396
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:47,810
nothing, teleport across dimensions, transmute
beings or environments, and warp reality. Immune

397
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:54,130
to temporal manipulation, he cannot be undone by
time travel or erased by retroactive changes.

398
00:37:54,130 --> 00:38:00,170
Though physically small, he is indestructible,
and his only consistent vulnerability is his

399
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:05,810
self-imposed rules of banishment, frequently
being just saying his name backward, which

400
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:11,530
returns him to the fifth dimension for a time. He is
a hyper-intelligent prankster and considered to

401
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:17,670
be one of the most dangerous entities in the DC
multiverse. If he's so powerful, how come he was

402
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:22,810
almost taken out by a common cold? It sounds like he
was put into a coma by some standard earthbound

403
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:27,370
sickness, something that would never happen to an
impossible man. For as powerful as you claim him to

404
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:33,210
be, he seems largely limited in what he has done,
compared to what he can do. Did you ever hear about

405
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:40,070
John Burns' fun little Easter egg where he implied
that Mr. Mixie Spitalik is impossible man when he

406
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:45,810
travels to the Marvel timeline? Like he changes
his form to look like impossible man and they're

407
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:50,050
actually the same character, across multiple
dimensions. Yeah, I was definitely aware of that,

408
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:54,710
and that's why I guess I assumed impossible man was
a reality warper, though I guess that's not

409
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:59,930
accurate. I assume that Burns' theory that he put
out there was debunked when the characters

410
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:05,190
actually met up in the Superman Silver Surfer
crossover comic. Although you could say that

411
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:09,610
since pop-upians can duplicate themselves
indefinitely, that they actually are still the

412
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:14,690
same character. Just different parts of that same
entity. And also since Mixie Spitalik is not bound

413
00:39:14,690 --> 00:40:14,030
by time, so he could have been battling a past or
future version of himself. Now that we got the

414
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:17,850
characters' histories and abilities out of the
way, let's speculate on how one of the 1000

415
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:22,950
simulated matches will go. The winner is
determined by simulations, not the speculation,

416
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:27,450
but it's fun to imagine how the fight could play
out. AJ and I.K., what are the rules of our

417
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:32,730
speculation? Well, I should say there are no
rules, other than the characters have no prior

418
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:37,490
knowledge of the other going into the fight. All
they are aware of starting out is that the other

419
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:42,650
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.
For the speculation, the contestants will begin

420
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:48,030
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript
environment that will have no bearing on the match

421
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:52,950
itself, as no environmental statistics are
considered in my simulations. The contestants

422
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:59,450
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright
then, let's get into it. Mixie and Impey, me on the

423
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:05,650
battlefield, who goes first? I think Impossible
Man would go first, because he'd just be so excited

424
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:12,850
for someone to play with. And with a pop sound, all
of a sudden he turns into a 100 foot tall birthday

425
00:41:12,850 --> 00:41:20,690
cake, where each tier of the cake is the size of a
story. A birthday cake? Okay, so Mixie's probably

426
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:28,350
like, is it my birthday? What the heck? And so he'll
teleport to the top of the cake just to blow out the

427
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:36,110
candles, and the gust from his breath is going to be
so powerful that it's going to scatter the cake all

428
00:41:36,110 --> 00:41:41,990
across the environment, just spreading Impey
thin everywhere. But all of a sudden, from within

429
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:47,710
the cake pops out Impossible Man, and he's like,
surprise, congratulations, you get to be my

430
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:54,930
plaything for the day. And then he transforms into
a firework rocket that shoots right into Mixie's

431
00:41:54,930 --> 00:42:02,310
Biddalock and explodes into these like dazzling
green and purple fireworks. And the display is so

432
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:09,990
loud and powerful, each one being like a TNT
explosion that Mixie is just blown to smithereens

433
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:15,770
from the fireworks. Well, I don't think he would be
blown to smithereens, but let's say he's charred

434
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:21,010
and blackened from the explosion, right? So he's
going to be angry, you know, he'll probably grab

435
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:27,070
his hat and slam it to the ground and be like, that
does it. And that's when he's going to conjure a

436
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:33,570
giant vacuum that's going to suck up all of the
sparkly bits of Impey raining down from the sky.

437
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:40,990
And when the vacuum bag is full, he's going to unzip
it and dump all the sludgy green and purple goop

438
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:47,070
into a giant trash bag that he's going to tie off and
be like, time to take out the trash. And he's going

439
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:55,270
to drop kick the trash bag, sending it right into
space. Okay, so Impossible Man is in a trash bag. He

440
00:42:55,270 --> 00:43:01,650
disappears from sight in the atmosphere. But then
all of a sudden, this giant green smiling face

441
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:07,990
appears in the sky and it gets bigger and larger as
it comes hurtling back down to earth because

442
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:14,190
Impossible Man teleported out of the trash bag and
then transformed into an asteroid that's in the

443
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:19,230
shape of his head. And as he comes careening back
onto the battlefield, he's like, here's Impey and

444
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:26,530
he crashes into and obliterates Mixi Spitalik
into nothing. Well, no, Mixi sees Impey careening

445
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:33,790
toward him. And that's when he rolls up the sleeves
of a baseball uniform that he's now wearing. And,

446
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:38,790
you know, he taps his baseball bat to the ground a
couple of times and swings right at the perfect

447
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:45,330
time, just smashing Impey into a whole bunch of
rocky bits. And he's like, grand slam. He's going

448
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:51,450
to start rounding the bases in this giant baseball
stadium that he just conjured up. A stadium? Yeah.

449
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:56,770
Okay. Well, after a bunch of popping sounds, all of
a sudden the stadium fills up with a bunch of

450
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:04,490
duplicates of Impossible Man who start booing
Mixi Spitalik. And the crowd then starts throwing

451
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:11,150
tomatoes, like green tomatoes, and purple banana
peels, and knives and grenades. So when he even

452
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:18,270
throws a shoe and Mixi Spitalik just gets pelted.
Well, Mixi is like, what the heck? And to protect

453
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:24,490
himself, he's going to teleport into the
Jumbotron, which, you know, has his face on it now.

454
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:31,050
And he transforms the stadium itself into like
this giant Mecca body with a screen for a face and

455
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:36,830
metal beams for limbs and cement fists and feet.
And he's just going to start stomping on and

456
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:42,810
terrorizing those. What is it? Pop-upians? Yeah,
pop-upians. Yeah. Okay. So the crowd of

457
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:49,290
pop-upians, they're going to flee this Mecca
stadium version of Mixi Spitalik. But then these

458
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:54,890
Impossible Men start climbing on each other's
shoulders. And they amass themselves into like a

459
00:44:54,890 --> 00:45:01,590
giant composite Sasquatch, like a green
Sasquatch. And the beast is going to swing his arms

460
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:09,230
into Mecca Mixi, just reducing him to rubble.
Okay. Well, Mixi, he's going to climb out of this

461
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:15,430
rubble. And he's probably all dirty and cursing.
And all of a sudden a light bulb is going to appear

462
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:20,590
above his head. And he's going to pull a chain
attached to it. And that's when everything goes

463
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:27,550
black. But suddenly a spotlight flashes on in the
darkness. And we're going to see Impossible Men in

464
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:32,310
his regular form standing there just looking
around like, what, where am I? And that's when

465
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:38,790
another spotlight is going to shine on Mixi, who's
holding this badass electric guitar shaped like

466
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:45,810
an axe. And he's wearing sunglasses. And he's just
going to shred this gnarly guitar solo. So epic.

467
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:52,390
What? So powerful that it just shakes Impy to his
very core. And he's so humbled by it that he just

468
00:45:52,390 --> 00:46:00,030
gives up the match. What is happening? So it's a
battle of the bands type thing. Sure. Yep. Okay.

469
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:04,870
Well, all right. Impossible Men would be game for
that. But like, he's not going to give up. He may be

470
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:11,150
impressed by Mixi's performance, but he's up for
the challenge. So Impossible Men transforms a

471
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:17,850
keyboard right in front of him. And it's like this
crazy, multi-tiered looking keyboard with keys

472
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:26,370
that don't even just go from A to G, but play a range
of notes from A to Z. Okay. And Impossible Men just

473
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:32,910
starts jamming out a keyboard solo that's so much
more epic and so otherworldly sounding, like

474
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:38,730
hitting all these chaotic notes. And then
suddenly when his solo is over, Mixi just vanishes

475
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:46,430
from sight back to the fifth dimension. Why?
Because within Impossible Men's solo, he

476
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:52,750
randomly spelled Mixi's name backwards using all
those extra music notes. What? Yeah. So part of his

477
00:46:52,750 --> 00:47:02,270
solo was like K, L, C, whatever, however you spell
his name. Backwards. Well, that was convenient.

478
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:08,590
Okay, but I'm going to say Mixi, since he's from the
fifth dimension, he was able to recognize what was

479
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:15,410
going on because apparently their music notes
also go up to Z. And before Impi could finish his

480
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:22,710
solo, that's when Mixi uses his axe guitar to chop
up the keyboard into pieces and then he just

481
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:28,990
decapitates Impi with it. You think that would
kill him? I don't know. I guess not. But let's say

482
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:36,070
Mixi is so angry by what almost happened that he's
going to banish the Impossible Man to the fifth

483
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:43,210
dimension instead, so he's trapped for eternity.
Match over. I'm going to say that Impossible Man

484
00:47:43,210 --> 00:47:49,290
played his solo so quickly that Mr. Mixi Spitalik
didn't even have time to react because he probably

485
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:54,230
played this with like multiple hands and multiple
arms, you know? Well, no, I mean, Mixi Spitalik

486
00:47:54,230 --> 00:48:00,250
could stop time. Okay. Well, I think that's a good
place to stop. Let's go ahead and input these

487
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:05,730
character stats and run the simulations and find
out whether Impossible Man pulled off this

488
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:12,870
reverse name keyboard solo or if Mixi caught on to
him and then banished Impossible Man to the fifth

489
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:16,970
dimension. We'll find out which of these
scenarios happens when we run the simulations.

490
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:23,490
8G9K, hit it. Inputting data, running
calculations, processing results, simulations

491
00:48:23,490 --> 00:48:28,970
complete. That was a fun match. These are really
fun characters. They may be one of the most fun

492
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:33,930
matches I think we've ever done on this podcast. I
mean, the sky was kind of the limit, right? So it was

493
00:48:33,930 --> 00:48:39,110
kind of fun to use my imagination to try to counter
what you were doing. Even just starting off with

494
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:44,210
their birthday cake is just so unique for our dual
speculations. I don't see that ever happening

495
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:49,310
again. This was definitely a fun one. Well,
stats-wise, both characters obviously are

496
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:55,770
insanely powerful. They were both maxed out in so
many stats like speed and invasiveness,

497
00:48:55,770 --> 00:49:00,210
durability and strength. But they both suck at
fighting. You don't really see either of these

498
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:05,750
guys throwing down in hand-to-hand combat in any
sort of trained or meaningful way. They just have

499
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:10,250
too much other abilities at their disposal to even
do that. Right. Yeah, both characters are

500
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:16,450
insanely versatile, although we did give the edge
to Mixi when it came to versatility. Right,

501
00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:21,710
because he can warp reality as opposed to just
transform. He also got the edge in terms of

502
00:49:21,710 --> 00:49:26,450
perception because he can kind of perceive things
outside of the standard three-dimensional space

503
00:49:26,450 --> 00:49:33,070
time. We said he was smarter than impossible man
who's kind of childlike. And we said that Mixi

504
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:39,450
Spidalik has the edge in damage, considering he's
nearly in nipotent. Not only that, we also gave him

505
00:49:39,450 --> 00:49:46,190
the edge in range, considering Mixi is not really
bound by space. Right. So with all that said,

506
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:51,650
Jonathan, who do you think is taking this one? It's
no contest. Mixi is totally going to win this. What

507
00:49:51,650 --> 00:49:59,290
a dumbass! Well, what? Okay, if I'm a dumbass, then
so are 73% of our Instagram poll takers who agreed

508
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:06,230
that Mixi is going to win. You all heard me. I would
be surprised if it was not you who was in fact the

509
00:50:06,230 --> 00:50:13,030
dumbass. Well, let's find out. AJ9K, the results
please. Hey, you are, sir. All right, the winner

510
00:50:13,030 --> 00:50:27,290
between Mr. Mixi Spidalik and Impossible Man is
Mr. Mixi Spidalik. Oh, look at that dumbass! Am I

511
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:34,570
the dumbass though? Because although Mr. Mixi
Spidalik won 80.3% of his matches over Impossible

512
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:40,670
Man's 19.7% victory rate, in the end, according to
John Byrne, these guys might be the same

513
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:46,310
character. So Mr. Mixi Spidalik's win rate is also
Impossible Man's win rate, and I consider this one

514
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:50,610
a tie. Okay, but even if they're the same
character, you're admitting that the DC version

515
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:56,630
of the character had the higher win rate. I admit
nothing. I admit it's a tie. How is it a tie when the

516
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:01,290
percentage is differed? That's just how it works,
man, with like 5th dimensional math. If you can't

517
00:51:01,290 --> 00:51:07,090
wrap your head around it, I don't know what to tell
you. We both win. Yay for Marvel. Way to go, guys. We

518
00:51:07,090 --> 00:51:42,510
did it. You can't beat Crazy, I guess. But that does
it for this duel. AJ9K, help close us out. Send Joe

519
00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:48,890
World and Console Combat. All right, and our next
episode is going to be a team duel. This time we're

520
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:54,990
going to find out who would win in a fight between
DC's freedom fighters versus Marvel's X Factor.

521
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:59,310
It's one of the biggest mutant teams that we
haven't gotten to yet. A lot of great characters in

522
00:51:59,310 --> 00:52:03,830
X Factor, and I'm really looking forward to that
match. But that does it for this episode. We want to

523
00:52:03,830 --> 00:52:08,850
give a big thanks to our executive producers, John
Staroski, Zachary Hepburn, Dustin Belcom,

Graves for helping make this podcast possible.

527
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:31,230
We'll talk to you guys next week. Up, up, and away.
True believers. I'm pretty sure it's pronounced

528
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:32,890
Mr. Mixio spit on it, hawk-toa.
