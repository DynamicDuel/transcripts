00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:25,486 --> 00:00:30,570
Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we
review superhero films and debate the superiority

3
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:35,774
between Marvel and DC by comparing their characters
and stat-based battle simulations. I'm Johnny

4
00:00:35,814 --> 00:00:41,619
DC. And I'm his twin brother Marvelous Joe.
And in this episode, we are pitting the Doom

5
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:48,204
Patrol leader, Niles Calder, aka the Chief,
against the X-Men leader, Charles Xavier, aka

6
00:00:48,284 --> 00:00:53,789
Professor X. Yeah, both of these guys are bound
to wheelchairs. They're both wicked smart.

7
00:00:54,209 --> 00:00:59,023
And While one of them has powers and the other
one doesn't, the Chief is highly versatile

8
00:00:59,503 --> 00:01:04,385
and a complete wild card. So I think it's going
to be a pretty good match. We said last week

9
00:01:04,405 --> 00:01:09,447
that this episode was going to be Dorothy Spinner
vs. Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur, but we're

10
00:01:09,488 --> 00:01:13,909
actually going to punt that duel to later on
next month and we're going to do this one now.

11
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:17,511
Yeah, before the matchup we're going to break
down the comic book movie news from the past

12
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:23,073
week of which there was just one minor news
item. In regards to speculation around Gal

13
00:01:23,093 --> 00:01:27,929
Gadot's involvement. in a potential Wonder Woman
movie. And we're also going to bring on Ken

14
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:33,133
Johnson, the host of the Max Destruction podcast,
to talk about his show. Yeah, as always, we

15

00:01:46,945 --> 00:01:53,751
Running Extensive Duels, just a rather very
intelligent simulator, 9000. Or Alfred Jarvis

And with that out of the way, quick to the No
Prize! A No Prize is an award Marvel used to

40
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:54,741
give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel
No Prize, is a digital award we post on Instagram.

41
00:03:55,114 --> 00:03:59,155
and in our email newsletter for the person that
we feel gave the best answer to our question

42
00:03:59,195 --> 00:04:04,817
of the week. Last week we asked, besides Loki,
what other Disney Plus Marvel television series

43
00:04:05,097 --> 00:04:10,398
that has come out do you most hope gets a season
2? And this is coming off of the trailer for

44
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:15,180
Loki season 2. We got quite a few answers, let's
go ahead and run down our honorable mentions

45
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:20,890
as well as the no prize winner. Our first honorable
mention goes to Travis Herndon, who said Hey

46
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:26,774
guys, Travis here. My pick would be a very controversial
pick, but I would say She-Hulk. I feel like

47
00:04:26,795 --> 00:04:31,859
that show could get redeemed with a season two.
Maybe bring in some people who've done the

48
00:04:31,899 --> 00:04:37,924
comics to write for She-Hulk, as well as maybe
bringing in one or two people who've done good

49
00:04:37,984 --> 00:04:45,030
lawyer shows to really make it feel like a lawyer
show with a splash of Marvel heroism. I just

50
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:50,458
feel like She-Hulk can get a redemption. Yeah,
this is a great answer. that I didn't think

51
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:54,622
about because She-Hulk is, you know, probably
the worst Disney plus Marvel television show

52
00:04:54,642 --> 00:05:01,048
to come out, in my opinion. But Tatiana Maslany
gave a great performance and the show's concept

53
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:06,693
has a lot of potential, especially if they lean
more into the like lawyer comedy drama case

54
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:12,098
of the week type format. Despite the fact how
much I disliked season one, I do think that

55
00:05:12,118 --> 00:05:17,038
the show can be redeemed with the season two.
And that's what I want to see. Yeah, I mean,

56
00:05:17,118 --> 00:05:22,181
as we've seen before, Kevin Feige is, you know,
not above self-correcting when he realizes

57
00:05:22,201 --> 00:05:26,244
that he's made a mistake. Take Trevor Slattery,
for example. I love what they've done with

58
00:05:26,264 --> 00:05:31,248
that character. And likewise, I don't think
She-Hulk, the series, is beyond redemption.

59
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:36,131
It needs to be redeemed, if anything. So great
answer, Travis. Our next honorable mention

60
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:42,135
goes to Rick McGrew from the RetroNomopod, who
said, Hey, guys, Rick from the RetroNomopod.

61
00:05:42,856 --> 00:05:48,388
Yeah, I think Jeremy Renner. Taking up his mantle
as Hawkeye would what I'd want to see for a

62
00:05:48,988 --> 00:05:55,653
second season. I like a ground-level hero I'd
like to see what other adventures Haley Steinfeld

63
00:05:55,693 --> 00:06:01,277
would Get up to as Kate Bishop and kind of see
where the relationship evolves to from where

64
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:06,920
we left off So yeah season two of Hawkeye, I
think is the win Yeah, due to Jeremy Renner's

65
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:13,425
unfortunate accident that happened last year
It's likely that he wouldn't take a starring

66
00:06:13,605 --> 00:06:17,810
action role within a Hawkeye season two, but
that's completely fine because they did a great

67
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:23,432
job of setting up the character's legacy in
Kate Bishop in Hawkeye season one. I think

68
00:06:23,472 --> 00:06:28,093
we really need to see where the story goes from
there, and I'm surprised actually that a Hawkeye

69
00:06:28,113 --> 00:06:32,475
season two hasn't been announced yet. Yeah,
same. I mean, considering that Jeremy Renner's

70
00:06:32,495 --> 00:06:37,776
Hawkeye was one of the first main Avengers,
I would really hope to see that a subsequent

71
00:06:37,816 --> 00:06:43,098
season would kind of establish a new Avengers
or sort of push in that direction. because

72
00:06:43,158 --> 00:06:47,479
I think the Avengers team is something that's
sorely missing from the MCU right now that

73
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:51,041
people are interested in. For sure, yeah, and
Hawkeye season one was definitely like the

74
00:06:51,121 --> 00:06:57,144
most Avengers-y feeling to it out of all the
Disney Plus shows. Great answer, Rick. Our

75
00:06:57,184 --> 00:07:02,626
next honorable mention goes to Anson Millard,
who said, Hey guys, this is Anson Millard.

76
00:07:02,946 --> 00:07:07,868
The easy answer for this is Moon Knight. It
was one of the best received Disney Plus shows.

77
00:07:08,448 --> 00:07:16,094
I think it's the best set up to have a sequel.
in another season. We can finally see Mark

78
00:07:16,214 --> 00:07:22,400
and Stephen work together with their combined
powers but there's also some room for some

79
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,484
drama between them because they like the same
girl can see some more stuff with Jake and

80
00:07:27,564 --> 00:07:31,688
I would love if they tie more into the direct.
It sounds like Anson got cut off there but

81
00:07:31,929 --> 00:07:35,752
I think he was gonna say he would like them
to take more in the direction of the comics.

82
00:07:36,253 --> 00:07:41,076
That's only a guess. because while the Moon
Knight television series was good, it was largely

83
00:07:41,096 --> 00:07:45,981
a departure from the source material. But he's
right. I wanna see where the Mark and Steven

84
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:50,724
relationship goes, especially with Scarlett
Scarab in the mix. And in the very last scene

85
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:55,869
of season one, we got introduced to Jake Lockley's
character, who I think can be explored too.

86
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:00,773
There's still a lot of mysteries within that
show that I think would be fun to see get addressed.

87
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:04,156
Yeah, it was also nice that the show had some
supernatural elements. I would actually like

88
00:08:04,176 --> 00:08:09,291
to see Gael Garcia Bernal's werewolf by night
character making appearance on the show considering

89
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:13,934
that you know moon night first made an appearance
in his comic. That would be incredible. That

90
00:08:13,954 --> 00:08:17,676
would be really cool. I'd like to see those
two team up even if it's just for an episode

91
00:08:17,716 --> 00:08:22,078
or something. Just go on an adventure together?
Yeah. Like just steering the moon night show

92
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:27,101
in that more supernatural horror route would
be really cool. For sure. Great answer, Anson.

93
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:32,044
We want to give a quick shout out to Christopher
Manotti, Meggy Mathengian, and Jose Marcial

94
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:36,590
for taking the time to visit our website and
record an answer. But the winner of this week's

95
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:43,555
no prize is Colby Hentges, who said, Hey boys,
Colby Hentges. I'm going loose with the concept

96
00:08:43,595 --> 00:08:49,679
of season two. What I want is an Elsa bloodstone
series coming out of the werewolf by night.

97
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:56,224
One shot. It could be a Buffy, the vampire slayer
style monster of the week show of just Elsa

98
00:08:56,264 --> 00:09:01,547
hunting down different monsters every week.
It would be awesome. That's my answer. Hell

99
00:09:01,587 --> 00:09:06,450
yeah, bro. This was a genius answer. Totally
sold me on this pitch. of having a Buffy the

100
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:11,913
Vampire Slayer take on the character of Elsa
Bloodstone who was first introduced in the

101
00:09:11,953 --> 00:09:16,636
Werewolf by Night special presentation around
Halloween last year. This is fantastic, we

102
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:21,659
could see the origin of the monster hunters,
get more backstory on her father Ulysses and

103
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:26,001
the Bloodstone itself, and get introduced to
a lot of supernatural characters from the comics

104
00:09:26,061 --> 00:09:32,365
incorporated into the MCU. Plus we could potentially
get more Manthing, who I think should be the

105
00:09:32,545 --> 00:09:37,251
new Groot. He just- seems like a really fun,
cool character. Which is weird to say, but

106
00:09:37,571 --> 00:09:42,774
it is what it is. And maybe we would even get
more Gal Garcia Bernal as werewolf by night.

107
00:09:43,155 --> 00:09:47,137
He could just cameo in all the shows, including
Moon Knight. So yeah, out of these answers,

108
00:09:47,197 --> 00:09:51,759
I would most want to see a Bloodstone series
for sure. So congrats to Colby Hentges for

109
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:56,162
winning this week's No Prize. If you, the listener,
want a shot at winning your own No Prize, stay

110
00:09:56,182 --> 00:10:00,404
tuned to later on this episode when we'll be
asking another question of the week. And now

111
00:10:00,424 --> 00:10:02,545
that that's done, on to the news.

112
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:13,765
Okay, a couple of weeks ago, Gal Gadot gave
an interview to ComicBook.com where she said

113
00:10:13,805 --> 00:10:18,267
that she loved playing Wonder Woman and that
she heard from James Gunn and Peter Safran,

114
00:10:18,527 --> 00:10:24,370
the heads of DC Studios, that they were going
to develop Wonder Woman 3 together. Not long

115
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:30,674
after that, she did another interview with Flant
Magazine where she explicitly said that she

116
00:10:30,694 --> 00:10:36,317
was invited to a meeting with James Gunn and
Peter Safran and that they told her and she

117
00:10:36,597 --> 00:10:41,068
said this was a quote. you're in the best hands,
we're going to develop Wonder Woman 3 with

118
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:45,692
you, we love you as Wonder Woman, you've got
nothing to worry about." This kind of caused

119
00:10:45,732 --> 00:10:53,178
an uproar on the interwebs from people who either
loved the idea of Gal Gadot remaining as Wonder

120
00:10:53,238 --> 00:11:00,264
Woman and another project happening in the new
Gunnverse, or just absolutely hated the idea

121
00:11:00,324 --> 00:11:06,449
and wanted Wonder Woman Recast. We haven't really
heard anything from James Gunn regarding this

122
00:11:06,489 --> 00:11:11,947
situation, which is strange considering, you
know, he'll go on to Twitter to debunk any

123
00:11:11,987 --> 00:11:16,868
random rumor that appears on there. But we did
hear from Warner Brothers through a variety

124
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:23,890
article saying that basically Gal Gadot was
mistaken. There are no plans to proceed with

125
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,591
a Wonder Woman film with her involved at this
time. And there's no Wonder Woman film planned

126
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:34,153
at all, only the Paradise Lost prequel series
that kind of tells the story of the Amazons

127
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:40,191
prior to Wonder Woman. being born essentially.
Yeah, if you ask me, I think Gal Gadot was

128
00:11:40,231 --> 00:11:46,534
trying to play to her fan base to force James
Gunn and Peter Safran's hand into keeping her

129
00:11:46,754 --> 00:11:54,077
on as Wonder Woman in the new DCU. I think Gal
Gadot has a disease and it's called Liabetes.

130
00:11:54,257 --> 00:11:59,219
And I stole that from a gift that I posted on
Discord. I don't think her intentions were

131
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:03,521
malevolent at all. You know, I think someone
asked her for an update and she just honestly

132
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:10,812
told them what she was told. I think James and
Peter absolutely told her that they're fans

133
00:12:10,832 --> 00:12:14,815
of her as the character and that they would
like to develop a new Wonder Woman movie with

134
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:18,937
her. But saying you're going to develop a project
with someone does not mean that they're going

135
00:12:18,977 --> 00:12:25,541
to star in that movie. We all know that Gal
Gadot is a huge Wonder Woman fan. It basically

136
00:12:25,581 --> 00:12:30,383
helped make her career. But considering the
fact that this is a whole new fresh start,

137
00:12:30,764 --> 00:12:35,194
it would be really confusing to me if Gal Gadot
continued in the role. I wouldn't hate it though

138
00:12:35,214 --> 00:12:39,277
if she served as like an executive producer
maybe, something like that. She would still

139
00:12:39,297 --> 00:12:44,300
be able to develop the story if she's truly
that passionate about the character. Yeah,

140
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,623
it would be like she was passing on the baton
to the next Wonder Woman in this new universe.

141
00:12:49,163 --> 00:12:54,887
I think that she played the character well enough
that I would like to see her at least partially

142
00:12:55,087 --> 00:13:00,218
involved, even if it's just an executive producer
title, in the new reboot. All in all, while

143
00:13:00,318 --> 00:13:05,361
I do love Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman and think
she's perfect in the role, I don't think she's

144
00:13:05,401 --> 00:13:10,344
the only one who's perfect in the role, or has
the potential to be perfect in the role. And

145
00:13:10,364 --> 00:13:15,306
I'm excited to see what is in store for the
future of the character on the big screen.

146
00:13:15,747 --> 00:13:20,569
Yeah, personally I'm hoping for a full on reboot
and recast, but that brings us to our question

147
00:13:20,589 --> 00:13:20,989
of the week.

148
00:13:25,486 --> 00:13:30,928
Who would you want to direct a Wonder Woman
reboot and why? Now we already asked you guys

149
00:13:30,968 --> 00:13:35,490
who you would want to recast as Wonder Woman
if the role did get recast and we got some

150
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:40,652
great answers, but now we wanna hear about your
director choices. Record your answer at dynamicduel.com

156
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:09,860
the news for this episode. Let's go ahead and
bring on Ken Johnson, the host of Max Destruction,

157
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,544
a Dynamike Podcast Network show that pits your
favorite action heroes from movies and television

158
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,514
against each other. Yeah, I'll get him on the
line right now. Hey, Ken, glad to have you

159
00:14:19,534 --> 00:14:25,557
back on the show since you were last on for
our 2004 Punisher review. How's it going? Great,

160
00:14:25,597 --> 00:14:30,280
except you didn't have me back for Punisher
Warzone, which I took as a personal affront.

161
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,463
We had to call a quick audible on that one because
of Ray Stevenson's passing, but we did want

162
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:41,947
to have you on for that episode if that is any
consolation. It is. RIP, Ray. You guys did

163
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:47,422
a great job. I think it was well reviewed. It
was outstanding. I appreciate you guys. adding

164
00:14:47,462 --> 00:14:51,223
me on for Punisher, that was definitely one
of my favorite things to do, uh, and really

165
00:14:51,263 --> 00:14:56,324
kind of put me into where I am now. For those
who don't know, Ken is an executive producer

166
00:14:56,424 --> 00:15:01,106
of Dynamic Duel. And as someone who has some
influence over what we do on this podcast,

167
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:05,967
he came to us essentially pitching a sister
show to ours, where he would use the Monte

168
00:15:05,987 --> 00:15:11,589
Carlo simulator we use, but for action movie
star fights. And from that idea spawned not

169
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:18,007
only his show, Max Destruction, but the whole
Dynamike podcast network. So Ken, first off,

170
00:15:18,227 --> 00:15:22,669
thank you for that. Between Max Destruction
and Send Your World, I think we're developing

171
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:26,951
a pretty neat collection of shows and Jonathan
and I love nothing more than taking credit

172
00:15:26,971 --> 00:15:33,334
for things that we're only tangentially involved
in. 100% and it's my way of influencing from

173
00:15:33,354 --> 00:15:39,677
the bottom. Yeah, Max Destruction has about
14 episodes right now. Your 15th episode is

174
00:15:39,717 --> 00:15:45,700
coming out tomorrow. Your co-host is another
executive producer of the show, Dustin Balcom,

175
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:51,623
who reviewed Big Hero 6 with us. Ken, how aware
were you at the time when you selected Dustin

176
00:15:51,643 --> 00:15:57,027
to do the show that you were going to be upstaged
to every turn? So it's a very interesting question

177
00:15:57,067 --> 00:16:02,810
and I really appreciate you asking that because
we can finally settle the score. Dustin definitely

178
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:08,193
upstages me every time. He is the one that's
actually working all the little puppet strings

179
00:16:08,213 --> 00:16:13,189
in the background. I'm not even really a person.
You guys have been talking to an AI program

180
00:16:13,469 --> 00:16:20,515
this entire time that Dustin has created. You
know what? Honestly, it's been a blessing to

181
00:16:20,575 --> 00:16:26,040
have Dustin as my co-host. Previous to this
podcast, of course, I had you call those tactics,

182
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:32,385
which the longest and worst issue I had with
that is finding a co-host that I could riff

183
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:38,502
with. It's so much fun to have somebody there
with you, either hyping you up, or trying to

184
00:16:38,902 --> 00:16:45,325
shit on you at every turn, which is, I find
probably the most enjoyable about our podcasts.

185
00:16:45,785 --> 00:16:51,047
And it's right up there with our deli guy, right?
It just spontaneously happened, and I'm so

186
00:16:51,067 --> 00:16:58,611
glad Dustin is willing and able to keep up with
my shenanigans. Yeah, the deli guy is a fictional

187
00:16:58,651 --> 00:17:03,753
character that pops up in every episode of Max
Destruction and is the brunt of a lot of the

188
00:17:03,793 --> 00:17:09,136
collateral damage that happens in... their speculative
battles and it is awesome. But I had to prop

189
00:17:09,176 --> 00:17:14,218
my boy Dustin up because he's part of Team Marvel
on our Discord. But you and Dustin have developed

190
00:17:14,258 --> 00:17:19,121
quite a funny antagonistic relationship and
you guys have speculated on some incredible

191
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:24,805
fights like Jason Bourne versus James Bond,
Zoro versus Spartacus, Blade versus Riddick.

192
00:17:25,205 --> 00:17:30,808
I have my own favorites so far, but what has
been your favorite episode to record? Oh my

193
00:17:30,848 --> 00:17:37,435
gosh. Okay, so I'll give you my top two. My
first favorite really is Born vs Bond. As a

194
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:42,236
military professional and representing the United
States, I was glad really to bring home that

195
00:17:42,336 --> 00:17:49,738
win. For America. Yeah, America, freedom, right?
The greatest episode I think I've had the most

196
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:55,380
fun with is probably one of the last ones we
did, which was Frank Dukes vs Nacho Libre.

197
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:01,638
I really loved that one. I knew from the moment
that I chose Nacho. I was free to just come

198
00:18:01,718 --> 00:18:07,660
at it as ham-handed as I wanted to. And I have
such love for both characters that no matter

199
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,501
how it turned out, it didn't matter to me. Yeah,
I have the unfortunate distinction of running

200
00:18:12,561 --> 00:18:18,183
the stats for Max Destruction. So all of the
episodes are spoiled for me. I always know

201
00:18:18,203 --> 00:18:23,764
who's going to come out on top. But the speculations
that you and Dustin do are just fantastic.

202
00:18:23,924 --> 00:18:29,578
I have to say I think my favorite episode so
far is the Crow versus Dean Winchester. just

203
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:33,982
learning about Dean, Manchester. I never watched
the show Supernatural, but it made me interested

204
00:18:34,022 --> 00:18:38,746
in that show because it's like totally the type
of show that I would very much watch and enjoy.

205
00:18:39,046 --> 00:18:44,671
And the crow is just awesome. I loved the fact
that you guys do these battles in environments,

206
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:49,856
because you essentially say, fuck dynamic duel
and they're not environment scenarios that

207
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:54,940
they come up with. The environments you guys
establish, like the church for that specific

208
00:18:54,981 --> 00:19:00,916
match was. just so cool as part of the visualization
and the imagination of just thinking about

209
00:19:00,996 --> 00:19:06,239
what was going on as you guys were describing
it. Yeah, my favorite episode I think has been

210
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:11,662
Jack Slater versus Dr. Smulder Bravestone, which
is essentially Last Action Hero versus Jumanji.

211
00:19:12,163 --> 00:19:16,585
Largely for nostalgic reasons, I just really
have a fond nostalgia for the movie Last Action

212
00:19:16,605 --> 00:19:21,128
Hero, which I remember seeing in theaters as
a kid. I also really liked Cameron Poe and

213
00:19:21,248 --> 00:19:26,310
Axel Foley. I think the speculation on that
was top tier. As hosts, you and Dustin do a

214
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:30,613
great job of making these two very disparate
characters interact in a way that feels true

215
00:19:30,633 --> 00:19:35,056
to how they would interact while staying true
to themselves and the movie worlds they came

216
00:19:35,096 --> 00:19:38,658
from. So I think that's one of the best things
about your show. Yeah. Well, I appreciate it.

217
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:43,982
Obviously, the speculation you think would kind
of come easily. I can honestly say that was

218
00:19:44,022 --> 00:19:48,485
the hardest thing to kind of get to. Like listening
to you guys is like, man, I don't know how

219
00:19:48,545 --> 00:19:53,038
you guys think this is hard. You're just talking
up a video game between two characters, but

220
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:58,360
then, you know, taking these individuals that
you may or may not have a ton of understanding

221
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:04,202
with. Like you're taking these characters that
haven't been seen on the big screen, you know,

222
00:20:04,302 --> 00:20:10,343
early 90s, sometimes 80s, and then trying to
apply them across the speculation and trying

223
00:20:10,363 --> 00:20:16,025
to make it fun. So, you know, getting the stride
of tit for tat, you know, if I'm going to do

224
00:20:16,085 --> 00:20:20,635
left, he's going to do right, but also not.
choreography, you know, trying not to set it

225
00:20:20,675 --> 00:20:26,681
up prior to having it be spontaneous. And then
for me, always finding that way of putting

226
00:20:26,701 --> 00:20:32,826
the nut shot on Dustin. And it doesn't matter
what character it is. I'm going to find a way

227
00:20:32,866 --> 00:20:37,750
of doing it because I know he's expecting it.
And now I know the audience is expecting it

228
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:43,595
because I'm getting that feedback. So audience,
thank you. Keep it coming. It really drives

229
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:51,903
me to excellence, personas. of finding the way
of achieving that goal. For sure. My favorite

230
00:20:51,923 --> 00:20:56,245
nut shot so far actually is when Zoro threw
his hat into Spartacus's balls. That was, I

231
00:20:56,265 --> 00:21:00,286
think, the most creative so far. Really liked
that. Did not see it coming, so kudos. I even

232
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:04,287
loved the nacho one where he just kind of like
fell over and like hit it from the floor, yeah.

233
00:21:04,307 --> 00:21:10,429
That was great. Speculating battles is almost
like an art form and you guys are doing so

234
00:21:10,469 --> 00:21:15,306
much better than we did at the same stage in
your podcast. Jonathan and I always knew the

235
00:21:15,347 --> 00:21:19,549
simulator could be used for something more than
just comics characters And as movie fans were

236
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:25,553
super glad you wanted to do an action movie
podcast as a fellow movie fan What are some

237
00:21:25,613 --> 00:21:30,476
of your favorite action movies and can we expect
any of those to show up in future episodes?

238
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:37,240
So absolute favorite action movies. One of them
is the episode that just came out which is

239
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:43,342
Indiana Jones so Raiders of the Lost Ark and
Last Crusade are my absolute favorite movies

240
00:21:43,482 --> 00:21:47,563
on earth. They really are. So Indiana Jones
is my favorite and I personally cannot wait

241
00:21:47,603 --> 00:21:54,265
to see how that turns out against Jack Sparrow.
Terminator is definitely up there. So Terminator

242
00:21:54,305 --> 00:21:59,207
2 is the greatest action movie on earth and
I would defy anybody to fight me on that one

243
00:21:59,407 --> 00:22:04,728
and I will legitimately fight you, not Monte
Carlo simulated, but anywhere anytime we will

244
00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:12,031
fight. The Terminator will definitely be showing
up. We're working on that. I really, really

245
00:22:12,111 --> 00:22:20,178
enjoy noir films. Casablanca is not an action
movie per se, but I can't wait to pit like

246
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:27,665
Dick Tracy up against somebody. So that's going
to be fun as we roll out. So our first season

247
00:22:27,685 --> 00:22:32,590
is only 20 episodes, guys. So after our first
season, we're gonna kind of rework things and

248
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:36,473
revisit and really take a look at these character
matchups that the audience has been putting

249
00:22:36,573 --> 00:22:41,499
out. and by picking out the ones that we think
would work the best, those are going to be

250
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:45,780
episodes that will be coming up in season two
and so on. I can't wait to see what matches

251
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:52,102
you guys come up with in the future. I'm hoping
for Neo from The Matrix and Bruce Willis from

252
00:22:52,202 --> 00:22:56,803
Die Hard. There's so many. Yeah, yeah. Well,
it was great to have you on as part of this

253
00:22:56,863 --> 00:23:02,205
episode. Ken Max Destruction is an awesome show,
and we are super proud to have it as part of

254
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:06,867

action movies and you want to see who'd win

00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:10,808
in a fight and are interested in hearing all
the creative ways Ken sneaks in a nut shot

262
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:53,277
But now let's get into the main event of this
episode, where we find out who's gonna win

263
00:23:53,337 --> 00:23:59,068
in a battle between the Doom Patrol leader,
the Chief, and the X-Men leader, Professor

264
00:23:59,389 --> 00:23:59,409
X.

265
00:24:14,774 --> 00:24:20,656
Okay, the Chief versus Professor X, this is
definitely a mind over matter duel, which are

266
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:24,878
always pretty interesting to do. It's taken
us a while to determine who we would want to

267
00:24:24,938 --> 00:24:29,520
pit against the Chief, because he doesn't really
have any powers. His superpower is essentially

268
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:34,302
that he's just really smart. But when it came
down to it, it was really hard not to do Professor

269
00:24:34,422 --> 00:24:39,864
X, considering the fact that Professor X is
kind of inspired by the Chief. Yeah, and the

270
00:24:39,964 --> 00:24:44,915
X-Men themselves were heavily inspired by Doom
Patrol. This duel of course is in lead up to

271
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:49,817
our 350th episode, which will be a team duel
between the Doom Patrol and the Guardians of

272
00:24:49,857 --> 00:24:55,340
the Galaxy. Now, we all know Professor X is
like the foremost telepathic mind in the Marvel

273
00:24:55,380 --> 00:25:00,343
universe, and a lot of people are probably wondering
why he's going up against the Chief, who seemingly

274
00:25:00,383 --> 00:25:06,166
has no powers, but I think the people who read
Doom Patrol or watch the series and know all

275
00:25:06,206 --> 00:25:11,209
about Niles Calder know that he has a contingency
for everything. That is basically his superpower.

276
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:17,500
He's so versatile. It's almost like he has every
superpower in like a one time use kind of situation.

277
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:21,961
That's the impression that I get. So I think
the stats will play out accordingly, and it

278
00:25:22,001 --> 00:25:26,263
should be closer than I think a lot of people
would give the chief credit for. Yeah, anyone

279
00:25:26,323 --> 00:25:32,106
doubting the chief, I think simply doesn't know
the chief. But we're going to rectify that

280
00:25:32,126 --> 00:25:37,748
in this episode. But to explain the methodology
behind our duels, let's go to our sentient

281
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:44,038
dual simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000, AJ 9K. Tell
our listeners how you go about determining

282
00:25:44,179 --> 00:25:49,641
a winner in our dual matchups. Yes, of course,
sir. The way I determine a winner between the

283
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:54,563
contestants is by running 1,000 Monte Carlo
simulations using the characters' statistics.

284
00:25:55,043 --> 00:25:59,485
A Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic
model used to determine outcomes through random

285
00:25:59,545 --> 00:26:05,387
sampling. In this case, I randomize the statistics
along a normal distribution as a way to simulate

286
00:26:05,407 --> 00:26:09,989
the many variables that can occur during battle.
The stat parameters are based on the official

287
00:26:10,049 --> 00:26:15,345
Marvel power grid. from which the DC characters'
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat

288
00:26:15,385 --> 00:26:20,689
categories are included, such as range, damage
potential, versatility, and perception, in

289
00:26:20,749 --> 00:26:25,973
order to create a more detailed and accurate
simulation. The results of the 1,000 simulations

290
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:30,357
provide a percentage of wins for each character.
The contestant with the higher percentage is

291
00:26:30,397 --> 00:26:36,073
declared the victor. as they have a higher probability
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,

292
00:26:36,454 --> 00:26:41,258
neither character should win 100% of the matches.
The comic book stories have shown that there's

293
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:46,203
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so
the confidence rate of my method falls in line

294
00:26:46,223 --> 00:26:50,827
with the precedents that have been established
in the source material. My mathematical simulations

295
00:26:50,867 --> 00:26:56,011
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes

296
00:26:56,071 --> 00:27:01,815
tabulated for determination of the winner. Thanks
AJ and IK. Before we run the simulations though,

297
00:27:01,835 --> 00:27:06,018
we like to break down each character's histories
and abilities before improvising a scenario

298
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:11,022
on how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations
would play out beat for beat. And I believe

299
00:27:11,062 --> 00:27:16,446
it's my turn to go first with the DC character's
backstory, so let me tell you all about Niles

300
00:27:16,466 --> 00:27:24,111
Calder, aka The Chief. Niles Calder was born
with an aptitude for genius. He was a polymath

301
00:27:24,131 --> 00:27:28,926
who excelled in his studies, particularly in
science and engineering. due to his obsession

302
00:27:28,946 --> 00:27:33,989
with the gothic horror novel Frankenstein or
the Modern Prometheus written by Mary Shelley.

303
00:27:34,369 --> 00:27:40,893
Fascinated by the concept of creating life,
Niles built incredible robots and, after obtaining

304
00:27:40,933 --> 00:27:46,796
his doctorate, was given a grant by a mysterious
benefactor who had noticed his work. Niles

305
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:51,719
created a laboratory and after running experiments
and developing a ray that could reanimate dead

306
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:57,050
tissue, he traveled the world, learning from
other scientists and shamans the ways in which

307
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:04,433
to prolong life. While in India during the 1960s,
Niles made considerable progress on a life-extending

308
00:28:04,493 --> 00:28:10,896
formula with the help of a wealthy mystic named
Ashok Desai, whose wife had died during childbirth.

309
00:28:11,236 --> 00:28:17,138
Believing that the formula was nearly complete,
Ashok tested it on himself, and though it worked,

310
00:28:17,438 --> 00:28:22,961
he also activated a latent metagen within him,
turning himself into a living portal to the

311
00:28:23,021 --> 00:28:28,862
netherworld and driving him insane. Ashok's
daughter, Arani, feared her father and ran

312
00:28:28,902 --> 00:28:34,884
away, living on the streets of Calcutta, where
she became deathly ill. Niles eventually found

313
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:40,066
Arani and married her, giving her the formula
on their wedding night in order to heal her

314
00:28:40,146 --> 00:28:46,307
sickness. Concerned about the motivations behind
his mysterious benefactor, Niles left Arani

315
00:28:46,387 --> 00:28:51,929
in the Himalayas to keep her safe. Niles soon
discovered that his benefactor was a man named

316
00:28:52,069 --> 00:28:57,985
General Immortus. an evil and wealthy despot
and former Nazi who had lived for thousands

317
00:28:58,025 --> 00:29:03,809
of years thanks to a magic potion that he had
lost the formula for and was counting on Niles

318
00:29:03,889 --> 00:29:09,473
to recreate. When Niles refused to finish his
work for Immortus, the villain implanted a

319
00:29:09,553 --> 00:29:15,537
bomb in Niles' chest, which could be detonated
remotely or if Niles attempted to remove it

320
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:21,561
while he was still alive. Forced to continue
his work, Niles instead orchestrated a plan

321
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:27,293
in which he manipulated Immortus into shooting
and killing him, stopping his heart. After

322
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:33,738
which, a surgical robot that Niles invented
removed the bullet and the bomb, and resuscitated

323
00:29:33,818 --> 00:29:40,163
Niles back to life. The operation took longer
than planned, however, and as a result, Niles

324
00:29:40,183 --> 00:29:46,207
was left a paraplegic without the use of his
legs. Initially distraught, Niles eventually

325
00:29:46,247 --> 00:29:51,550
developed a theory that he called the Catastrophe
Curve. essentially believing that traumatic

326
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:57,472
events such as his own would force people to
adapt and emerge stronger and better than before.

327
00:29:57,952 --> 00:30:03,834
Deciding he needed to stop General Immortus,
Niles saw others who had underwent debilitating

328
00:30:03,974 --> 00:30:10,055
traumas to help him combat evil, eventually
putting together the Doom Patrol, which initially

329
00:30:10,095 --> 00:30:16,137
consisted of Robot Man, Negative Man, and Elastigirl,
each of whom you could learn more about in

330
00:30:16,157 --> 00:30:21,443
their respective duel episodes. against The
Thing, Cyclops, and Ms. Marvel respectively.

331
00:30:21,883 --> 00:30:28,024
Having become wealthy by patenting several inventions,
Niles used scientific means to help each of

332
00:30:28,044 --> 00:30:34,206
the Doom Patrol members overcome the accidents
that left them quote unquote freaks and develop

333
00:30:34,266 --> 00:30:40,768
superhuman abilities as a result. Niles himself,
however, kept his motivations and even his

334
00:30:40,848 --> 00:30:47,279
identity a secret from the team, revealing himself
only as the Chief. It wasn't until numerous

335
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:52,923
adventures later, during the Doom Patrol's third
battle against General Immortus, that Niles

336
00:30:52,963 --> 00:30:59,589
was forced to explain his real name and backstory
to the team. Several years later, while battling

337
00:30:59,629 --> 00:31:04,973
the villains General Zal and Madame Rouge, Niles
and the other Doom Patrol members decided to

338
00:31:05,053 --> 00:31:10,597
sacrifice their lives in order to stop the villains
from blowing up the small town of Codsville,

339
00:31:10,758 --> 00:31:16,386
Maine. You can learn more about this in our
Madame Rouge vs Mystique duel episode. Upon

340
00:31:16,446 --> 00:31:23,548
hearing of Niles' death, Arani left Asia and
started her own Doom Patrol team to find Niles,

341
00:31:23,868 --> 00:31:29,890
who she believed was still alive. Arani, whose
temperature-controlling metagene was activated

342
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:35,971
after Niles left her due to his formula, went
by the codename Celsius, and it was later revealed

343
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:42,033
that her hunch was correct. Niles had survived
the explosion thanks to a force field that

344
00:31:42,073 --> 00:31:47,875
he had activated. after which he went into hiding
from General Immortus and began secretly working

345
00:31:47,895 --> 00:31:54,296
for the US government. Arani died shortly after
Niles' existence was discovered, and Niles

346
00:31:54,377 --> 00:32:00,198
rejoined the Doom Patrol, which reformed with
all new members including Dorothy Spinner and

347
00:32:00,258 --> 00:32:05,880
Crazy Jane, the latter of whom you can learn
more about in our Crazy Jane vs Legion episode.

348
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:12,141
During the team's adventures, Niles had secretly
been working on his magnum opus, the ultimate

349
00:32:12,414 --> 00:32:18,579
and cruelest implementation of his catastrophe
curve theory. After killing one new Doom Patrol

350
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:24,243
member known as Tempest for asking too many
questions, Niles was confronted by Robotman,

351
00:32:24,644 --> 00:32:30,188
to whom Niles revealed that he was responsible
for the original Doom Patrol team's traumatic

352
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:35,793
accidents, along with several others who made
up the Doom Patrol's enemy team known as the

353
00:32:35,833 --> 00:32:41,581
Brotherhood of Evil. Just before Niles could
enact his master plan to detonate a nanotech

354
00:32:41,621 --> 00:32:47,226
bomb that would destroy half the world's population
and turn the rest into freaks, his head was

355
00:32:47,266 --> 00:32:53,372
torn from his body by the Candlemaker, a creature
created from the mind of Dorothy Spinner. Dr.

356
00:32:53,412 --> 00:32:59,097
William Magnus, who you can learn more about
in our Metal Men vs. Colossus episode, managed

357
00:32:59,197 --> 00:33:05,246
to save Niles' head, however, and built a new
robotic body for him. while insisting that

358
00:33:05,306 --> 00:33:11,170
Niles make up for his horrible actions. Wracked
with guilt, Niles removed his own head from

359
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:17,675
his robot body, after which he existed as a
disembodied head for some time. After rebuilding

360
00:33:17,715 --> 00:33:23,018
the Doom Patrol and merging with one of its
new members, Niles died after entering the

361
00:33:23,078 --> 00:33:29,043
Tree of Life. After the events of Infinite Crisis,
when Superboy Prime altered events within DC's

362
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:35,399
continuity, the original Doom Patrol, including
Niles Calder, emerged as a team once again,

363
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:41,042
and while its members were aware that Niles
was responsible for their accidents, they forgave

364
00:33:41,082 --> 00:33:47,366
him. During the Blackest Night event, Arani
was resurrected as an evil black lantern zombie,

365
00:33:47,746 --> 00:33:54,069
and used her powers to freeze and shatter Niles'
legs. After teleporting her and other black

366
00:33:54,109 --> 00:33:59,533
lanterns to the Justice League's location for
them to deal with, Niles set to work on creating

367
00:33:59,673 --> 00:34:05,779
a new body for himself. successfully forming
one from Kryptonian cells allowing him to gain

368
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:11,560
the powers of Superman. After turning on his
team, he was defeated by the Doom Patrol and

369
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:17,742
his comatose body was placed in storage. In
post-Flashpoint continuity, Niles Caulder created

370
00:34:17,762 --> 00:34:23,484
a Doom Patrol team consisting of its original
members and Element Woman. After the team learned

371
00:34:23,524 --> 00:34:28,645
from Lex Luthor that Niles caused the traumatic
accidents that turned them into superhumans,

372
00:34:29,105 --> 00:34:34,671
the team disbanded. Niles was able to reform
the team eventually, but they fired him once

373
00:34:34,691 --> 00:34:39,552
they realized he was using them for his own
selfish purposes once again. And that's Niles

374
00:34:39,572 --> 00:34:45,294
Colder's history. Powers-wise, the Chief has
a genius level intellect and is a world-renowned

375
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:50,975
expert in the fields of robotics, engineering,
chemistry, physics, biology, and many others.

376
00:34:51,455 --> 00:34:56,697
He's developed an array of machines, devices,
and formulas, including Robot Man's body, the

377
00:34:56,737 --> 00:35:01,923
radiation-containing bandages of Negative Man,
a life ray that brings the recently dead back

378
00:35:01,963 --> 00:35:08,646
to life, nanobots that can rearrange matter
itself, an elixir that extends one's lifespan,

379
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:15,829
and forcefield and portal generators from his
wheelchair. He also packs a gun, so break yourself.

380
00:35:19,211 --> 00:35:24,133
Niles Calder has always been a fascinating character
to me. I think he's one of DC's most interesting

381
00:35:24,173 --> 00:35:29,216
characters, actually. largely informed by my
viewing of the Doom Patrol television series,

382
00:35:29,256 --> 00:35:33,718
but to actually hear the comic book series,
I'm all the more intrigued. It was really interesting

383
00:35:33,818 --> 00:35:40,002
how he ended up in a wheelchair, but I think
it's weird how writers made him go from a guy

384
00:35:40,082 --> 00:35:46,386
who was testing out the catastrophe theory into
like a super villain who wanted to destroy

385
00:35:46,426 --> 00:35:49,328
half the world. I feel like that was a pretty
large leap there.

386
00:35:52,674 --> 00:35:57,016
Don't self pity yourself even though like this
horrible thing happened to you. You can turn

387
00:35:57,036 --> 00:36:02,379
that into something greater. They took that
to its extreme where he believed that catastrophe

388
00:36:02,399 --> 00:36:08,422
was necessary to sort of evolve humanity. And
so he was going to be the arbiter of that.

389
00:36:08,822 --> 00:36:13,805
Delusions of grandeur. You know what though,
Professor X has some dark shit in his backstory

390
00:36:13,845 --> 00:36:18,908
too. Let me go ahead and tell you all about
that right now. Now Charles Xavier was born

391
00:36:18,988 --> 00:36:25,075
in New York City to Sharon and Brian Xavier.
renowned nuclear physics researcher operating

392
00:36:25,215 --> 00:36:31,239
in New Mexico. As a genetic mutant, Charles
began manifesting the earliest signs of his

393
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:37,163
latent psychic potential while still in the
womb as he recognized his twin as a malignant

394
00:36:37,203 --> 00:36:42,706
presence. Though his sister Cassandra tried
to kill Charles as a fetus, he was able to

395
00:36:42,726 --> 00:36:48,129
defend himself with his telepathic ability,
causing Cassandra to apparently be stillborn.

396
00:36:48,686 --> 00:36:53,907
When Charles was nine years old, his father
Brian died in an accident at the research facility

397
00:36:54,367 --> 00:37:00,509
and his mother Sharon married a Dr. Kurt Marco.
The three moved into Sharon's family estate

398
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:06,151
in Westchester, New York, where Charles met
his new stepbrother, Cain Marco. Charles' new

399
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:11,613
stepfather Dr. Kurt Marco was abusive, however,
and relentlessly beat his wife Sharon and his

400
00:37:11,653 --> 00:37:18,068
son Cain, who in turn bullied Charles. The young
Charles not only endured torment at the hands

401
00:37:18,108 --> 00:37:23,694
of his stepbrother, but as his telepathic abilities
began growing in power, he also experienced

402
00:37:23,794 --> 00:37:29,439
Kane's and his mom Sharon's abuse firsthand.
Ultimately, the abuse proved to be too much

403
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:35,906
for Sharon, and she succumbed to alcoholism.
Shortly after, Dr. Kurt Marco died in a fire

404
00:37:36,006 --> 00:37:41,746
inside their mansion home, leaving Charles and
Kane as orphans. Fortunately, Charles had a

405
00:37:41,846 --> 00:37:47,189
gifted academic mind and was able to graduate
high school and attend Bard College, graduating

406
00:37:47,209 --> 00:37:53,032
with a degree in biology at age 18, by that
point having lost all of his hair. He then

407
00:37:53,052 --> 00:37:58,414
went overseas to Oxford University for his postgraduate
studies, earning master degrees in genetics

408
00:37:58,494 --> 00:38:04,717
and biophysics. There, he met fellow student
Moir McTaggart, and the two developed a romantic

409
00:38:04,777 --> 00:38:09,668
relationship. After college, Charles decided
to join the military, where he excelled in

410
00:38:09,728 --> 00:38:14,470
search and rescue missions through the use of
his telepathic powers. Charles then traveled

411
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:20,394
the world, ending up working at an Israeli hospital
for Holocaust survivors, where he first encountered

412
00:38:20,554 --> 00:38:26,417
a fellow mutant named Eric Lencher, whom you
can learn more about in our Sinestro vs. Magneto

413
00:38:26,497 --> 00:38:32,080
duel episode. The two men often debated on how
the evolving human race would affect mankind.

414
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:38,051
While Eric foresaw war and death, Having suffered
his whole life for being different, Charles,

415
00:38:38,211 --> 00:38:43,254
more idealistic, hoped for a future of peace
and acceptance between humans and mutants.

416
00:38:43,814 --> 00:38:49,557
Later, after encountering a destructive, power-hungry
mutant called the Shadow King in Egypt, Charles

417
00:38:49,617 --> 00:38:55,159
realized that the existence of malevolent mutants
would mean he would ultimately have to fight

418
00:38:55,199 --> 00:39:01,042
to protect his cause and convince the human
race of a peaceful coexistence. He then traveled

419
00:39:01,082 --> 00:39:06,063
to the Himalayan mountains, where he encountered
an alien named Lucifer, who was scouting the

420
00:39:06,103 --> 00:39:11,244
planet in preparation for a future invasion.
To prevent any interference, the alien dropped

421
00:39:11,264 --> 00:39:18,006
a massive stone block on Charles' legs, crippling
him. While recovering in Bombay, India, Charles

422
00:39:18,046 --> 00:39:23,268
began working on a device called Cerebro that
would amplify his telepathic abilities and

423
00:39:23,308 --> 00:39:28,469
help him find other mutants. He began psychically
reaching out to young mutants in an effort

424
00:39:28,489 --> 00:39:33,914
to help them control including a young Jean
Grey, whom you can learn more about in our

425
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:39,896
Raven vs. Phoenix episode. Charles then traveled
back to New York and attended Columbia University,

426
00:39:39,956 --> 00:39:45,798
where he received a PhD in anthropology and
a medical doctorate in psychiatry, before transforming

427
00:39:45,818 --> 00:39:51,740
his family estate in Westchester into an institute
for young mutants. It was there he would teach,

428
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:56,541
protect, and guide students in the use of their
burgeoning abilities, instilling in them his

429
00:39:56,581 --> 00:40:03,207
dream of human and mutant peace. Charles' initial
students consisted of Cyclops, Jean Grey, Beast,

430
00:40:03,528 --> 00:40:09,330
Archangel, and Iceman, and he called them the
X-Men for their extra abilities. You can learn

431
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:14,733
more about the team in our Titans vs X-Men team
duel episode. In their first field mission,

432
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:20,116
the X-Men fought Charles' old friend Eric, now
known as Magneto, who had assembled his own

433
00:40:20,156 --> 00:40:25,890
group, the Brotherhood of Mutants, to enforce
mutant superiority. Over the years, the X-Men

434
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:29,753
protected humanity from threats such as the
Juggernaut, who was Charles' step-brother,

435
00:40:29,793 --> 00:40:35,317
Cain Marco, now imbued with the power of the
magical crimson bands of Scytoric, a mystic

436
00:40:35,377 --> 00:40:40,321
entity. Charles also directed his team against
the Sentinels, who were mutant hunting robots,

437
00:40:40,741 --> 00:40:45,465
and the Savage Land Mutates, who were experiments
from an Antarctic jungle. Though Charles and

438
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:50,728
the X-Men saved the Earth time and again, they
never won humanity's respect, and mankind's

439
00:40:50,788 --> 00:40:56,379
fear of mutants only grew. With his reputation
preceding him, Charles joined an elite secret

440
00:40:56,419 --> 00:41:01,741
group of the planet's most influential figures
called the Illuminati, which included Iron

441
00:41:01,761 --> 00:41:07,363
Man, the Submariner, Dr. Strange, Mr. Fantastic,
and Black Bolt, and the group would prevent

442
00:41:07,403 --> 00:41:14,086
sensitive global catastrophes in secret. Eventually,
the X-Men came across Krakoa, a sentient island

443
00:41:14,126 --> 00:41:19,548
that captured the team, forcing Charles to recruit
a new band of mutants to rescue them, including

444
00:41:19,628 --> 00:41:25,475
Storm, Wolverine, Colossus, and Nightcrawler.
As his group of students grew, Charles received

445
00:41:25,535 --> 00:41:31,057
a telepathic message from LaLondra, the princess
of the Shi'ar alien race who sought his help.

446
00:41:31,417 --> 00:41:35,919
Charles and LaLondra fell in love, and after
a mission that seemingly killed most of the

447
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:42,162
X-Men, he moved to space to live with the Shi'ar
as LaLondra's consort. Charles later returned

448
00:41:42,222 --> 00:41:47,664
to Earth and recruited another young team called
the New Mutants. Around this time he learned

449
00:41:47,684 --> 00:41:52,442
that he had a son named David with a woman he
met in Israel. the young man suffered from

450
00:41:52,542 --> 00:41:58,304
severe psychic trauma and would later be known
as the Mutant Legion. Eventually, the missing

451
00:41:58,484 --> 00:42:04,266
X-Men returned and Charles led the team to fight
Magneto on his orbital asteroid base. During

452
00:42:04,286 --> 00:42:09,727
that fight, Charles mentally shut down Magneto's
mind, which caused the evil portion of the

453
00:42:09,747 --> 00:42:15,269
villain's psyche to implant itself in Charles'
brain. This evil presence, combined with Charles'

454
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:21,095
vast telepathic power, eventually manifested
into a dark psychic entity called Onslaught,

455
00:42:21,575 --> 00:42:26,776
which took a majority of Earth's heroes to defeat
and nearly destroyed the world. Remorseful

456
00:42:26,816 --> 00:42:31,658
for his part in Onslaught's creation, Charles
turned himself over to government authorities,

457
00:42:31,998 --> 00:42:37,059
who then attempted to use Charles' powers against
mutant kind. Rescued by the X-Men, Charles

458
00:42:37,139 --> 00:42:42,441
helped the team fight the ancient mutant apocalypse,
but faced a more personal psychic threat when

459
00:42:42,461 --> 00:42:48,126
his twin sister Cassandra Cassandra Nova was
revealed to have survived from the womb as

460
00:42:48,166 --> 00:42:54,028
a psychic presence and took over Charles' body.
She exposed Charles as a mutant to the world

461
00:42:54,248 --> 00:42:58,929
and caused the obliteration of the entire mutant
population living on the island of Genosha.

462
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:04,211
Eventually Jean Grey was able to use Cerebro
to help constitute Charles' mind within his

463
00:43:04,351 --> 00:43:10,132
own body, pushing Cassandra Nova out. Charles
used the publicity surrounding his mutant status

464
00:43:10,152 --> 00:43:11,713
to create the X Corporation,

465
00:43:14,882 --> 00:43:20,426
that would provide resources to mutants in need.
All was not well however, as it was later revealed

466
00:43:20,486 --> 00:43:25,129
that Charles had kept secrets from the X-Men.
Back when the X-Men were captured by the sentient

467
00:43:25,229 --> 00:43:30,573
island of Krakoa, Xavier had recruited a new
team to rescue them, but they perished in the

468
00:43:30,613 --> 00:43:36,658
attempt. Xavier also kept secret that the danger
room was powered by a sentient Shi'ar artificial

469
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:41,781
intelligence that he had suppressed. The AI
eventually broke free and attacked the X-Men.

470
00:43:42,354 --> 00:43:46,335
After a time, Xavier was able to make peace
with the Danger Room, and he sought redemption

471
00:43:46,375 --> 00:43:51,356
alongside the mutant Gambit in their mission
to stop the evil geneticist, Mr. Sinister.

472
00:43:51,857 --> 00:43:56,938
At one point, Cyclops, who had amassed the power
of the Phoenix Force and had become Dark Phoenix,

473
00:43:57,338 --> 00:44:02,560
killed Charles. With him dead, the villainous
Red Skull harvested Charles' brain and used

474
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:08,230
it to imbue himself with telepathic powers,
turning himself into the Red Onslaught. After

475
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:12,253
the Red Onslaught was defeated, it was revealed
that Charles' mind had been abducted by the

476
00:44:12,273 --> 00:44:17,377
Shadow King to fight in a never-ending battle
on the Astral Plane, which is a psychic plane

477
00:44:17,397 --> 00:44:22,702
of existence. The X-Men found Charles and rescued
him from the Astral Plane, with X-Men member

478
00:44:22,842 --> 00:44:29,207
Phantom X donating his body for Charles' mind
to inhabit. Shortly after, Charles implemented

479
00:44:29,247 --> 00:44:31,469
a plan he had been working on with former love
interest

480
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:41,951
He developed a system in which all mutants could
live in peace and be resurrected through a

481
00:44:42,011 --> 00:44:47,512
process that used a combination of mutant abilities.
Charles sent telepathic invitations to all

482
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:54,034
mutants, helping to turn Kakoa into an influential
world power, and finally finding a worthy compromise

483
00:44:54,334 --> 00:45:00,076
between his ideals and those of his old friend
Magneto. And that's his backstory. Powers-wise,

484
00:45:00,136 --> 00:45:05,237
Professor X possesses vast psionic abilities
and is regarded as having the most powerful

485
00:45:05,277 --> 00:45:10,731
mind on Earth. With his psychic powers, he can
perform a variety of telepathic effects including

486
00:45:10,851 --> 00:45:18,333
mind reading, mind control, mind erasure, mind
transference, thought casting, illusion casting,

487
00:45:18,893 --> 00:45:25,395
psychic cloaking, psychic shielding, psychic
pain, and psychic astral projection, all at

488
00:45:25,435 --> 00:45:31,637
a range of up to 250 miles or 400 kilometers.
He has a genius level IQ and is the world's

489
00:45:31,697 --> 00:45:37,266
foremost authority on genetics and mutation.
and is an expert in nearly every field of mental

490
00:45:37,386 --> 00:45:43,508
and life sciences, as well as an expert strategist
and diplomat. He is also gifted in engineering,

491
00:45:43,668 --> 00:45:48,870
having created Cerebro, which amplifies his
abilities to a global range and has become

492
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:55,011
mobile in its latest versions. Prior to his
paralysis, Professor X was a proficient hand-to-hand

493
00:45:55,051 --> 00:46:00,253
fighter, having received combat training from
his time in the military. His weaknesses include

494
00:46:00,333 --> 00:46:06,314
telepathic shielding, such as Magneto's helmet.
and the paralysis of his legs. To offset this

495
00:46:06,374 --> 00:46:12,056
latter weakness though, he rides a hoverchair
invented by the mutant Forge who incorporated

496
00:46:12,136 --> 00:46:18,558
Shiar technology and is controlled via mental
command. And that's Professor X. I totally

497
00:46:18,618 --> 00:46:25,860
forgot about Onslaught. Would we ever do a duel
with Onslaught? The entity itself doesn't have

498
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:31,941
a huge history on its own, but I guess I could
go into greater detail of the story of Onslaught.

499
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:34,337
if and when that time came. Okay, cool.

500
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:45,728
Well, now that we've got their histories and
abilities out of the way, let's speculate on

501
00:46:45,768 --> 00:46:52,472
how one of the 1000 simulated matches will go.
The winner is determined by simulations, not

502
00:46:52,512 --> 00:46:57,395
this speculation, but it's fun to imagine how
this fight could play out. Alfred Jarvis9000,

503
00:46:58,175 --> 00:47:03,398
what are the rules of our speculation? Well,
I should say there are no rules, other than

504
00:47:03,418 --> 00:47:07,781
the characters have no prior knowledge of the
other going into the fight. All they are aware

505
00:47:07,821 --> 00:47:12,328
of starting out... is that the other character
is a threat that needs to be eliminated. For

506
00:47:12,368 --> 00:47:17,572
the speculation, the contestants will begin
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript

507
00:47:17,612 --> 00:47:22,415
environment that will have no bearing on the
match itself, as no environmental statistics

508
00:47:22,435 --> 00:47:27,638
are considered in my simulations. The contestants
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright

509
00:47:27,658 --> 00:47:32,862
then let's get into it. The Chief and Professor
X meet on the battlefield. Who goes first?

510
00:47:38,294 --> 00:47:43,918
the chief's mind and learning all about this
guy, who he is, what he can do. OK, I was prepared

511
00:47:43,938 --> 00:47:51,585
for this, though. OK, because I'm thinking like
the chief's brain is a vast labyrinth of knowledge

512
00:47:51,605 --> 00:47:57,329
and experiences that would make like most men's
heads just explode if they ever got a peek.

513
00:47:58,130 --> 00:48:04,836
So, OK, if Professor X ever got a mental glimpse
into that mind, like at the very least, he'd

514
00:48:04,876 --> 00:48:11,064
be so shocked by the breath. of information
and atrocities and just dark thoughts within

515
00:48:11,084 --> 00:48:16,388
the chief's mind. He'd just be like, holy crap.
Right. So that's going to leave the chief at

516
00:48:16,448 --> 00:48:21,252
least a few seconds to pull out his gun and
just shoot Professor X like right in the bald

517
00:48:21,292 --> 00:48:26,395
dome. That is quite the assumption right there.
And I'm guessing a lot of your strategy actually

518
00:48:26,475 --> 00:48:31,199
hinged on Professor X being shocked by Niles
Calder's brain. Yes. You know what? I actually

519
00:48:31,219 --> 00:48:36,650
believe that would happen. I think that Niles
Calder has a really. crazy ass mind judging

520
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:40,953
by all the crazy ass adventures the Doom Patrol
have been on. So sure, if the Chief needed

521
00:48:40,993 --> 00:48:45,736
to buy himself a second, this is where he buys
it. But also, like then again, Professor X

522
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:50,318
has dealt with like a lot of disturbed minds
also. So I don't think he's quite as stunned

523
00:48:50,518 --> 00:48:54,841
by the Chief's brain as he thinks he is. I think
he's able to actually avoid the Chief's gunshot

524
00:48:54,881 --> 00:49:01,785
by using mind control at the last second to
throw off his firing can. Okay, that just means

525
00:49:01,825 --> 00:49:06,907
that the bullet's just gonna... hit his hover
chair then instead of his head. And you know,

526
00:49:07,167 --> 00:49:13,088
that's gonna make the hover chair malfunction
and just go haywire. So Professor X, he's essentially

527
00:49:13,248 --> 00:49:18,650
writing a mechanical bull at this point and
he's gonna be too distracted to perform any

528
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:22,731
psychic attacks. You can't do that to a man
in a wheelchair. What the hell's going on here?

529
00:49:23,051 --> 00:49:29,693
Just did, it just did. Okay, so if Professor
X's hover chair is like flying around, Professor

530
00:49:29,813 --> 00:49:35,659
X. is gonna mentally steer it as best he can
to crash into the chief's wheelchair, just

531
00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:40,140
murderballing the dude. Do you know what murderball
is? Like people know what murderball is, right?

532
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:46,922
Yeah, I know. It was a documentary about the
US men's paraplegic rugby team. Right. And

533
00:49:46,962 --> 00:49:50,863
in that movie they just knock the shit out of
each other, pushing other wheelchair guys to

534
00:49:50,883 --> 00:49:56,465
the ground. That's what happens here, the chief
is knocked over in his wheelchair. Okay, so

535
00:49:57,005 --> 00:50:04,161
I didn't mention this in my bio, but... The
Chief can walk. What? He doesn't actually need

536
00:50:04,201 --> 00:50:10,305
his wheelchair. Why? He cured himself of his
paralysis a long time ago. He just used the

537
00:50:10,346 --> 00:50:19,392
wheelchair to avoid suspicion and garner sympathy.
Oh my God. What a fucking prick. Yeah, yeah.

538
00:50:19,833 --> 00:50:25,377
That's what Robotman said essentially as well.
So the Chief, you know, he just dives back

539
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:30,821
toward his wheelchair. and he's going to activate
a button that actually transforms the wheelchair

540
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:38,047
into this like robotic exoskeleton suit kind
of like robot man and wearing that exo suit

541
00:50:38,367 --> 00:50:43,131
he's going to leap onto professor x's hover
chair and just yank him right out of it and

542
00:50:43,151 --> 00:50:48,916
just like fling him to the ground this dude
sucks but i'm going to say that before the

543
00:50:48,936 --> 00:50:54,621
chief can even lay a hand on the professor x
is going to start erasing the chief's mind

544
00:50:54,701 --> 00:51:00,409
right including his knowledge of how this exosuit
even works. So the chief's not going to be

545
00:51:00,429 --> 00:51:04,251
able to do anything. His mind is just going
to go blank. But like the chief has worked

546
00:51:04,291 --> 00:51:10,594
with psychics on the patrol like Mento before.
So he'd most likely be able to realize if his

547
00:51:10,674 --> 00:51:16,098
mind is being erased. And I'm going to say,
like, once he notices that without hesitation,

548
00:51:16,378 --> 00:51:20,360
real quick, he's just going to whip out the
squirt gun from his jacket and he's going to

549
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:28,523
spray this anti-medicine. formula onto Professor
X that's gonna erase his mutant powers. Meta-humans

550
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:34,425
aren't the same thing as mutants. They're basically
the same thing. Chief made a formula that can

551
00:51:34,485 --> 00:51:40,826
erase powers? Well, I mean, he made a formula
that could trigger Meta-Genes and extend life,

552
00:51:41,046 --> 00:51:46,748
so sure, yeah, he could reverse engineer that
to remove Meta-Gene powers as well. The dude's

553
00:51:46,808 --> 00:51:52,349
smart. Like, I'm calling bullshit. I feel like
your speculation hinges on a lot of assumptions.

554
00:51:52,758 --> 00:51:57,762
You don't think Chief would be prepared living
in a world with metahumans to be able to disable

555
00:51:57,782 --> 00:52:03,246
them? I guess he's created so many superpowered
beings it's not out of the realm of possibility

556
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:10,372
that he has means to depower them. But before
this depowering formula fully kicks into effect,

557
00:52:10,892 --> 00:52:16,277
Professor X, he's gonna reach into the trunk
of his hoverchair and pull out a mobile Cerebro

558
00:52:16,317 --> 00:52:21,261
device, and he's gonna put it on, it's gonna
amplify his power so that before his psychic

559
00:52:21,281 --> 00:52:27,331
abilities vanish, he still has enough psychic
juice to make Chief's mind explode from a telepathic

560
00:52:27,371 --> 00:52:33,233
blast. Force field. Boom. The blast doesn't
reach the Chief because he activates a force

561
00:52:33,253 --> 00:52:39,174
field that includes psychic shielding. All right.
The Chief's then going to launch a capsule

562
00:52:39,214 --> 00:52:44,816
of nanobots from his exosuit at Professor X
and that's just going to disassemble his body

563
00:52:45,196 --> 00:52:51,517
at the molecular level. Essentially, it looks
like he dissolved Professor X with acid. Okay,

564
00:52:51,557 --> 00:52:59,504
sure. Whatever. All right. But if you remember
earlier in this duel, Professor X erased part

565
00:52:59,524 --> 00:53:06,385
of the chief's mind, right? And the dark malevolent
side of the chief combined with Professor X's

566
00:53:06,465 --> 00:53:13,307
psychic power. So now in place of Professor
X is Onslaught. Way to go. And now the chief

567
00:53:13,347 --> 00:53:18,149
is a fuck like a million times over because
Onslaught is going to tear through his mind

568
00:53:18,369 --> 00:53:22,386
and just obliterate it like a boot crushing
an ant. And no force field is going to hold

569
00:53:22,486 --> 00:53:28,587
onslaught back. Match over. So the chief is
dead? Yeah, the chief's dead. Onslaught just

570
00:53:28,647 --> 00:53:34,789
ripped his mind a new butthole. OK, I mean,
jokes on you, though, because once the chief's

571
00:53:34,809 --> 00:53:41,051
heart stops beating, it triggers his exosuit
to emit a life ray, which brings the recently

572
00:53:41,151 --> 00:53:47,833
dead back to life. And once he's back, that's
when he activates a portal to the D creator,

573
00:53:48,153 --> 00:53:53,539
which is this giant eyeball in the sky that
lays its sights right on Onslaught and just

574
00:53:53,819 --> 00:54:00,723
de-creates him. I mean, Niles too, probably.
But Onslaught first, so the Chief wins. Well,

575
00:54:00,843 --> 00:54:05,365
I remember the de-creator from the show. Yeah,
that. That's way more powerful than Onslaught.

576
00:54:05,786 --> 00:54:10,548
I don't think so, but it doesn't matter because
from the very beginning this whole match actually

577
00:54:10,568 --> 00:54:16,832
took place in the Astral Plane, where Professor
X took Chief's mind to play out as like a psychic

578
00:54:16,852 --> 00:54:23,631
illusion this whole match to And now that Professor
X knows what the chief would do and like his

579
00:54:23,711 --> 00:54:28,914
curiosity has been satiated. He's just going
to leave the chief in this comatose state where

580
00:54:28,954 --> 00:54:33,597
he believes that he's been decreated by the
Decreator. How did I know you were going to

581
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:40,640
go there? It's all an illusion. It was all a
dream. I say it all really did happen and Professor

582
00:54:40,761 --> 00:54:45,123
X was dissolved and onslaught was decreated.
You can't just go back to the beginning of

583
00:54:45,143 --> 00:54:49,265
the match and be like, oh, it never happened.
Yes, I can, because that is one of Professor

584
00:54:49,365 --> 00:54:55,833
X's powers. Haters gonna hate, and mind manipulators
gonna manipulate. So we'll go ahead and leave

585
00:54:55,853 --> 00:55:00,116
the match there and input these characters'
stats and find out which scenario actually

586
00:55:00,156 --> 00:55:07,521
happens when we come back with a winner. AG9000,
take it away. Inputting data, running calculations,

587
00:55:07,982 --> 00:55:14,346
processing results, simulations complete. Okay,
as we predicted, these characters have fairly

588
00:55:14,466 --> 00:55:20,150
different stats. As we mentioned, Professor
X is very one note, and the chief is... quite

589
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:25,374
versatile. In fact, that was the chief's highest
stat, the versatility. That makes sense because

590
00:55:25,394 --> 00:55:30,899
the chief has a contingency for everything,
right? But Professor X was off the charts in

591
00:55:30,939 --> 00:55:36,284
terms of damage level, considering the guy can
render, you know, like an entire town inert

592
00:55:36,504 --> 00:55:41,628
just by shutting down everybody's minds. And
his range was also ridiculously high considering

593
00:55:41,648 --> 00:55:47,353
he can stretch his mind out to a radius of 250
miles and extend that even further with Cerebro.

594
00:55:47,393 --> 00:55:51,920
Right. We did say though that the chief was
smarter, he had a higher intellect, and he

595
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:58,144
was more evasive, thanks to the fact that he
utilizes force fields. Yeah, I had a real hard

596
00:55:58,185 --> 00:56:04,008
time conceding even the notion that the chief
is smarter than Professor X. But then you gotta

597
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:09,112
kinda consider the chief at the same level as
Mr. Fantastic Reed Richards. Yes, Professor

598
00:56:09,312 --> 00:56:15,156
X is a brilliant genius. A large part of that
though has to do with his psychic faculties,

599
00:56:15,216 --> 00:56:21,703
not necessarily his book smarts. Professor X
is the foremost authority on genetics and mutation,

600
00:56:22,183 --> 00:56:29,265
but Reed Richards and the chief can like invent
teleportation devices. So Professor X was lower

601
00:56:29,465 --> 00:56:35,086
in the intelligence stat, but he was much higher
in the perception stat where we accounted for

602
00:56:35,126 --> 00:56:39,708
his telepathic abilities, including mind reading.
Yeah, the perception stat is where the two

603
00:56:39,748 --> 00:56:45,409
characters had the largest discrepancy when
it came to stats. So taking all of this into

604
00:56:45,449 --> 00:56:50,311
consideration. Who do you think came out on
top? Professor X. Gotta go with the main mind

605
00:56:50,352 --> 00:56:56,275
here. As smart as Chief is, he's just not as
powerful. And not only do I think that, a vast

606
00:56:56,295 --> 00:57:00,317
majority of people think that, because according
to our Instagram poll that we put out there,

607
00:57:00,857 --> 00:57:06,901
86% of our Instagram followers think that Professor
X is gonna win. That's a big margin. I guarantee

608
00:57:06,921 --> 00:57:13,084
you though, that is just because of the X-Men
cartoons and the movies. People just love the

609
00:57:13,224 --> 00:57:18,414
X-Men. So of course they're gonna vote for an
X-Man. Yeah, people like the X-Men because

610
00:57:18,494 --> 00:57:23,677
they're more popular than the Doom Patrol because
Marvel's better. So I agree with you. Yes.

611
00:57:24,217 --> 00:57:29,799
Well, let's see how misplaced your confidence
is. AJ 9K, the results, please. Hey, you are,

612
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:37,162
sir. The winner of the matchup between the Doom
Patrol's chief and the X-Men's Professor X

613
00:57:37,982 --> 00:57:51,007
is. Professor X, you damn right it is. By 60.8.
percent. Professor X won 608 of the 1000 simulated

614
00:57:51,107 --> 00:57:57,049
matches, whereas the Chief only won 392. You
know, that's actually closer than I thought

615
00:57:57,069 --> 00:58:02,570
it was going to be. For as careful as I was
not to underestimate Niles Calder, I still

616
00:58:02,610 --> 00:58:07,032
did in the fact that he got a few more wins
than I thought he would. I mean, you made a

617
00:58:07,072 --> 00:58:10,673
believer out of me. When you first mentioned
this match, I didn't think it was going to

618
00:58:10,693 --> 00:58:15,214
be that great because I figured Professor X
would win. So this isn't really a surprise

619
00:58:15,234 --> 00:58:18,875
to me. But when I started delving more into
the character and was like, hey, maybe he could

620
00:58:18,915 --> 00:58:25,778
pull this off. I really got hopeful and I regret
that now cause I feel bad. Good. Actually,

621
00:58:25,818 --> 00:58:29,880
when you were going into the chief's backstory
and you were talking about how he gave himself

622
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:36,002
Superman powers and stuff like that, I'm like,
oh no, I made a horrible suggestion, but you

623
00:58:36,022 --> 00:58:41,104
know, I feel really happy about how this all
turned out. Yeah, I mean, the chief has no

624
00:58:41,144 --> 00:58:45,895
powers, but he has tremendous potential. In
the end, though, I guess that can overcome

625
00:58:46,295 --> 00:58:52,139
just the vast sheer might of Professor X, which
sucks. I mean, for you, yeah, not for Marvel

626
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:57,984
fans. As it turns out, Professor X has a greater
mind. Marvel fans have the greater minds. Wait,

627
00:58:58,404 --> 00:59:04,769
what? Yeah. Yep. You didn't know that? Makes
sense because you're a DC fan that you wouldn't

628
00:59:04,809 --> 00:59:12,614
know something. I can't say no, I didn't know
that because. Whatever. That does it for this
