00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:29,151
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:34,577
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based

4
00:00:34,717 --> 00:00:41,164
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother Johnny DC. And in this episode

5
00:00:41,204 --> 00:00:47,607
we are going to review season one of My Adventures
with Superman. which is an animated television

6
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:53,531
series that debuted on Cartoon Network and Max.
It was 10 episodes long and it was pretty good.

7
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:56,714
Can't wait to talk about it later on this episode.
Before that, we're going to break down the

8
00:00:56,754 --> 00:01:00,697
latest comic book movie news to come out this
past week, of which we got news about some

9
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:06,742
release date changes for Marvel shows on Disney+.
As always, we list our segment times in our

10
00:01:06,782 --> 00:01:10,464
episode description, so feel free to check out
the show notes if you want to skip ahead to

11
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:15,138
a particular topic. As our listeners may know,
our dual simulator is so advanced that it's

12
00:01:15,178 --> 00:01:19,525
gained sentience, and it's named itself the
artificial life form for running extensive

13
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:26,415
duels, just a rather very intelligent Simulator
9000 or Alfred Jarvis 9000. Here's a quick

14
00:01:26,455 --> 00:01:32,756
message for our listeners, so listen up. Why
hello there. Do you love listening and chatting

15
00:01:32,796 --> 00:01:37,942
about Marvel and DC? Then become a part of the
dynamic dual community on Patreon, where you

16
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:43,267
can choose from three tiers. The dynamic two-o
tier lets you listen to this podcast without

17
00:01:43,388 --> 00:01:48,113
ads and gives you access to its discord chat
group, where you can chat with Johnny DC and

18
00:01:48,153 --> 00:01:53,059
Marvelous Joe. The Fantastic Four tier gives
you that and more with two bonus episodes each

19
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,541
month, including bloopers and top ten shows
where Johnny and Joe count down your favourite

20
00:01:57,581 --> 00:02:02,604
Marvel and DC subjects. The X-Force tier makes
you an executive producer of Dynamic Duel,

21
00:02:02,964 --> 00:02:06,886
where every month you help the hosts choose
what to review and who to fight against each

22
00:02:06,946 --> 00:02:12,888
other. And finally, the Dynamite Podcast Network
tier allows aspiring podcasters to create their

23
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:16,230
own battle-focused show using this Monte Carlo
simulator.

24
00:02:35,944 --> 00:02:41,648
Thanks AJ9K, and thanks to everyone who supports
the podcast. Be sure to tune into the Max Destruction

25
00:02:41,688 --> 00:02:48,826
podcast, which is part of the Dynamike Podcast
Network, to witness the bare-knuckle across

26
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:53,768
film and television. This week on Wednesday
September 6th, you can learn who would win

27
00:02:54,068 --> 00:03:01,151

into Senjou World, another Dynamite Network
show featuring your favorite anime characters

29
00:03:05,833 --> 00:03:09,494

30
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:15,737
a fight between Tire Harabelle from Bleach and
Hoshigaki Kasami from Naruto. I am horrible

31
00:03:15,777 --> 00:03:20,006
at pronouncing these names. Damn it, Zach. But
no, I'm actually blown away by your character

32
00:03:20,026 --> 00:03:23,888
selection. I don't know who these characters
are half the time, but it's always fascinating

33
00:03:23,928 --> 00:03:27,649
to learn about these anime characters in the
show. Yeah, totally. Makes me want to watch

34
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:33,831

out of the way, quick to the no prize. A no

36
00:03:40,573 --> 00:03:45,207
prize is an award Marvel used to give out to
fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel No Prize,

37
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:50,210
is a digital award we post on Instagram and
in our email newsletter for the person that

38
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:55,193
we feel gave the best answer to our question
of the week. Last week we asked you guys to

39
00:03:55,253 --> 00:04:01,878
pitch us your perfect Marvel vs. DC video game
and to tell us what it would be like. We only

40
00:04:01,918 --> 00:04:07,101
got two eligible answers. To be fair, we are
recording this episode early due to Labor Day

41
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:11,515
weekend. Right, right. But still, that's not
a whole lot of participation. For what I thought

42
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:15,418
was a pretty interesting question, like just
describe the most awesome Marvel versus DC

43
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,340
video game you can think of. Yeah, like Rampage,
but with Lestaro or Fing Feng Fum. That's just

44
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,303
off the top of my head, guys. Fucking bejeweled
blitz, but it's Marvel versus DC. I don't know

45
00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:30,346
how you would do that, but you can imagine it'd
be pretty awesome. It would be Infinity Stones

46
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:35,909
and Green Lantern Rings. Boom, off the top of
my head, it just happens. It's that easy, guys,

47
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:41,213
to call in. We did get pretty solid answers
for the two answers we did get, so let's go

48
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:45,076
ahead and run down our honorable mention and
the no prize winner. Our first honorable mention

49
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:51,401
goes to Colby Hentges, who said, Hey boys, Colby
Hentges. I could have any Marvel vs DC video

50
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:58,007
game. It would play like Skullgirls. Batman
Robin vs Caveland Deadpool, Three Teen Titans

51
00:04:58,027 --> 00:05:03,992
vs Spider-Man, Rocket and Groot vs Bane, any
one-on-one or three-on-three matchup or anything

52
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:09,258
in between. It would be awesome. Okay, I've
never actually heard of Skullgirls, but I looked

53
00:05:09,298 --> 00:05:14,500
it up and it looks pretty interesting. Basically,
the premise of the game is you're a bunch of

54
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,281
goth schoolgirls that are fighting against each
other that have like magic powers. The gameplay

55
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:24,343
style is very much in the vein of Marvel versus
Capcom, but like way more insane and you can

56
00:05:24,383 --> 00:05:29,964
choose any combination of up to three fighters
per matchup, kind of like how in Marvel versus

57
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:34,145
Capcom, you select two fighters and they fight
back to back or you can switch off in between

58
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:38,967
them. during the course of the fight. It looks
like a pretty damn cool game. It would be incredible

59
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:44,068
to have a Marvel vs DC video game like this.
Yeah, with the appeal really being that you

60
00:05:44,108 --> 00:05:48,429
don't have to select just one character to fight
with, but up to three or maybe more for this

61
00:05:48,469 --> 00:05:53,651
game. Like give me the entire seven roster member
Justice League to fight with. That'd be dope.

62
00:05:53,671 --> 00:05:57,092
I would do it. I'd play the shit out of that
game. That would be dope. I do love how you're

63
00:05:57,132 --> 00:06:02,513
comparing it to Marvel vs Capcom though, instead
of just Street Fighter. Just say Street Fighter.

64
00:06:04,438 --> 00:06:09,661
Well, I always thought of Marvel vs. Capcom
as being a much more over the top, crazy video

65
00:06:09,701 --> 00:06:13,083
game than Street Fighter. Although, you know,
Street Fighter has gotten pretty over the top

66
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:17,445
as well over the years. But yeah, they're both
great games. Great answer, Colby. We do have

67
00:06:17,485 --> 00:06:22,928
to give a shout out to Christopher Manotti,
who recorded an answer, but he described a

68
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:28,852
Arkham style nightcrawler video game with no
DC element to it. So it didn't qualify, unfortunately,

69
00:06:28,992 --> 00:06:33,234
but thank you for taking the time to record
your answer. The winner of this week's snow

70
00:06:33,274 --> 00:06:40,559
prize though is Matt Lamb who said, Hey guys,
Matt Lamb here. So my idea for this game would

71
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:45,383
be in the style of injustice and mortal combat.
Um, I think it'd be a good way to show off

72
00:06:45,423 --> 00:06:52,147
their powers and abilities. I think it put in
a, uh, Finisher, not a fatality, but something

73
00:06:52,187 --> 00:06:57,471
special to, uh, in the match for the winner.
Um, and I was thinking storyline, this could

74
00:06:57,491 --> 00:07:06,028
all start off where Mr. meets Mojo and they
decide to have a fun game between both universes.

75
00:07:06,609 --> 00:07:13,033
Yeah, considering Ed Boon made comments regarding
a Marvel vs. DC video game last week, and Ed

76
00:07:13,053 --> 00:07:17,076
Boon is the head of NetherRealm Studios who
makes the Mortal Kombat and Injustice video

77
00:07:17,096 --> 00:07:21,879
games, it seems most likely that if this game
were going to be made, it would be in that

78
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:27,423
same Mortal Kombat style. And they're great
games! Yeah, they're fantastic. I love NetherRealm's

79
00:07:27,483 --> 00:07:32,926
storytelling. You know, they created Injustice,
which is just fantastic. They also have incredible

80
00:07:33,066 --> 00:07:36,728
character designs. They've gotten much better
at that than they have in the past, I feel.

81
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:41,950
So I would love to see them render all of the
Marvel and DC characters that they would have

82
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:47,713
on the rosters. It would be insanely cool and
brutal AF. It's fricking Netherrealm. Right.

83
00:07:48,493 --> 00:07:54,336
If I'm being honest, I actually do like the
moral combat renders more than Capcom's, which

84
00:07:54,396 --> 00:07:58,418
tend to be a little bit cartoony, you know,
like in the Street Fighter vein. Right. Mortal

85
00:07:58,458 --> 00:08:03,220
Kombat approaches the characters almost like
if they were live-action movie costumes, you

86
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,782
know? Right. And I think that would be really
cool to see in a video game for Marvel and

87
00:08:06,802 --> 00:08:10,424
DC. I think they'd have to brighten up their
palette a bit, because a lot of their games

88
00:08:10,744 --> 00:08:15,087
feel like very dark. Mm-hmm. But yeah, it could
totally work. I think it would be fantastic.

89
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:20,190
Now I know Matt Lamb said that the characters
wouldn't have fatalities but special finishers,

90
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:24,452
but screw that, what would Batman's fatality
be? He would just run your ass over with the

91
00:08:24,472 --> 00:08:31,224
Batmobile. That's pretty good. What about Spider-Man?
Spider-Man's Mortal Kombat fatality, he would

92
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:36,128
totally like mark of Kane your shit up. Like
he'd stick his hand onto your face and then

93
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:41,612
just rip your face right off. Oh damn! And then
he'd web up your entire body and then web swing

94
00:08:41,652 --> 00:08:46,355
you and slam you into the ground until you're
just like bag of mush. I will accept that.

95
00:08:48,457 --> 00:08:52,540
Great answer, Matlam. Congrats for winning this
week's No Prize. If you, the listener, want

96
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,509
a shout out winning your own No Prize. Stay
tuned till later on in this episode where we'll

97
00:08:56,549 --> 00:09:01,397
be asking another question of the week. And
now that that's done, on to the news!

98
00:09:06,998 --> 00:09:11,800
Alright, this past week we heard from the Hollywood
Reporter that Marvel is shuffling their TV

99
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:19,424
calendar, setting new dates for The Agatha Show,
Echo, X-Men 97, and What If. Initially we were

100
00:09:19,444 --> 00:09:24,807
supposed to get all of these shows this year
in 2023, considering it's already September.

101
00:09:24,927 --> 00:09:28,809
It seemed highly unlikely that this was all
going to happen this year, especially due to

102
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:34,152
the ongoing writers and actor strikes. Disney
Plus is still going to release Loki Season

103
00:09:34,172 --> 00:09:39,046
2 this year, starting on October 6th. But the
first show to get pushed back was What If,

104
00:09:39,206 --> 00:09:43,728
which is now going to debut around Christmas
time of this year, so the very end of the year.

105
00:09:43,928 --> 00:09:48,069
Echo was originally supposed to drop in November,
all the episodes were going to drop at the

106
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:54,791
same time, but that got pushed to January of
2024. The animated series X-Men 97, which is

107
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:59,652
going to be a continuation of the classic 1990
series from Fox, that's going to come out sometime

108
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:07,740
early 2024, around springtime. And then finally...
Agatha Coven of Chaos has been renamed to Agatha

109
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:13,544
Darkhold Diaries, and it's going to drop in
the fall season of 2024. It's crazy because

110
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:18,968
the Agatha show was originally named House of
Harkness, then it got renamed to Coven of Chaos,

111
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:26,474
and now it's called Darkhold Diaries. It's like
pick a name, holy shit. Seriously. But I do

112
00:10:26,514 --> 00:10:31,577
think that like right around Halloween time
is a perfect time to drop an Agatha television

113
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:36,801
series. Do you like the name Darkhold Diaries?
I mean, sure, it works just like the rest of

114
00:10:36,821 --> 00:10:40,463
them worked. I think they all were fine. I liked
Covenant of Chaos, I'm not gonna lie. Yeah,

115
00:10:41,064 --> 00:10:47,268
I liked that one too. But considering that we
now have a show dropping early 2024 in Echo,

116
00:10:47,468 --> 00:10:54,633
spring 2024 in X-Men 97 and autumn 2024 in Agatha
Darkhold Diaries, it makes me think that other

117
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:59,737
shows that have been filmed or partially filmed
such as Ironheart, Daredevil Born Again and

118
00:10:59,817 --> 00:11:05,722
Wonder Man. are all getting pushed into 2025,
which is possibly a good thing. I know there's

119
00:11:05,762 --> 00:11:09,966
a lot of concern going around that Marvel is
producing too much content that people aren't

120
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:15,431
able to keep up with and therefore are kind
of losing interest in. And so I think the aim

121
00:11:15,532 --> 00:11:21,477
is to focus on the quality and make sure that
the release dates are staggered to hold audience

122
00:11:21,517 --> 00:11:26,124
interest. Yeah, I think it's a smart move. Bob
Iger pretty much admitted that there was too

123
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:31,087
much Marvel content on Disney+. This gives them
some breathing room to kind of reevaluate what

124
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:35,029
they want to do with each series and make sure
it's a little bit more cohesive, I think, going

125
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:40,812
forward, hopefully. But speaking of all of these
shows, in particular X-Men 97, that brings

126
00:11:40,852 --> 00:11:42,113
us to our question of the week.

127
00:11:46,602 --> 00:11:53,786
90s kids, what was your favorite Marvel or DC
cartoon from the 90s and why? Basically, if

128
00:11:53,806 --> 00:11:57,528
you're listening to this and you were born after
the 90s, you can still answer but also you're

129
00:11:57,548 --> 00:12:02,011
too young. You're just too young. You're too
young. Be older, because we're looking for

130
00:12:02,131 --> 00:12:07,775
90s cartoons. It was the best era for Marvel
and DC cartoons, in my humble opinion. Yeah,

131
00:12:07,795 --> 00:12:11,317
I think it was definitely like the Renaissance
after shows like Super Friends and stuff like

132
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:16,239
that, you know? Yeah. Record your answer at

136
00:12:29,363 --> 00:12:34,525
Dynamic Duel No Prize that we'll post to Instagram
and our email newsletter. Be sure to answer

137
00:12:34,565 --> 00:12:36,025

138
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:46,952
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and move into

139
00:12:46,992 --> 00:12:54,036
our main event, where we review the DC animated
series on Cartoon Network and Max, My Adventures

140
00:12:54,176 --> 00:12:55,737
with Superman, Season 1.

141
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:16,371
Adventures with Superman is a 10-episode animated
series made for Cartoon Network's Adult Swim

142
00:13:16,431 --> 00:13:22,753
programming block and the Mac streaming platform
by the series' showrunners Jake Wyatt, Brandon

143
00:13:22,773 --> 00:13:29,095
Kloffer, and Josie Campbell. The series explores
Clark Kent's early career as both a journalist

144
00:13:29,135 --> 00:13:34,757
for the Daily Planet and as the superhero Superman,
as well as the burgeoning relationship with

145
00:13:34,797 --> 00:13:40,295
his colleague Lois Lane. It was a fantastic
series. that modernizes Superman in a way that

146
00:13:40,335 --> 00:13:45,740
has never been done before. I definitely recommend
watching it. It's available on Macs. Once again,

147
00:13:46,141 --> 00:13:51,566
please watch it before listening any further
to this spoiler review. Yeah, even as a Marvel

148
00:13:51,586 --> 00:13:57,271
fan, I highly recommend this series. It actually
turned out better than expected when the executive

149
00:13:57,311 --> 00:14:03,337
producers requested that we review the show.
I was kind of a whiny bitch about it. I didn't

150
00:14:03,357 --> 00:14:08,703
want to do it. I feel like we've seen this story
done well before in the Smallville television

151
00:14:08,743 --> 00:14:14,186
series and even in animated form recently with
the Man of Tomorrow movie. But this show ended

152
00:14:14,226 --> 00:14:18,227
up blowing all my expectations away and when
I first started watching it I was like, what's

153
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:24,210
this cartoony shit? By the time I was done,
I considered it one of the best interpretations

154
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:28,852
of Superman's origin story that has existed.
Way better than Man of Tomorrow, honestly.

155
00:14:29,012 --> 00:14:34,122
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, no question. Like you,
when this cartoon was first announced... I

156
00:14:34,342 --> 00:14:37,945
can't say I was looking forward to it, and I
was also surprised when it was decided that

157
00:14:37,965 --> 00:14:43,029
we were going to review it, because we don't
usually review Cartoon Network shows. You know,

158
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:47,573
considering the fact that the episodes were
dropping on Macs shortly after their Cartoon

159
00:14:47,593 --> 00:14:52,277
Network debut, and because the episode count
was relatively short, we figured we'd review

160
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:56,040
it, and I'm really glad we did, because like
you mentioned, the show was way better than

161
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,983
I thought it would be, and it's definitely a
far cry from the character that we've seen

162
00:15:00,044 --> 00:15:04,634
on the big screen for the past decade, I would
say. When My Adventures with Superman was first

163
00:15:04,714 --> 00:15:09,636
announced in early 2021, based off the title,
I was under the impression that it was a series

164
00:15:09,656 --> 00:15:14,957
that focused on Lois Lane specifically, and
you know, like her perspective regarding Superman

165
00:15:15,197 --> 00:15:20,619
and life in Metropolis. Right away, I assumed
I wasn't the target demographic. And you know,

166
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,240
I'd probably watch it with my daughters, but
probably wouldn't enjoy it. I was totally wrong.

167
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,714
I enjoyed the shit out of the show, because
I forgot how much I could relate. to the romantic

168
00:15:30,794 --> 00:15:35,296
side of the Superman story, which is an element
that has been there since the very beginning

169
00:15:35,316 --> 00:15:41,599
of the character's introduction since 1938.
Jerry Siegel, one of the creators of Superman,

170
00:15:42,039 --> 00:15:47,322
said that one of the inspirations for Clark
Kent as an alter ego was because he had crushes

171
00:15:47,382 --> 00:15:52,884
on girls who didn't even know he existed. And
he thought to himself, what if, secretly, he

172
00:15:52,904 --> 00:15:58,388
was really great? What if he was super? The
love triangle of sorts that stemmed from Clark

173
00:15:58,448 --> 00:16:04,814
Kent loving Lois Lane, but Lois Lane loving
Superman, was this tragic component that allowed

174
00:16:04,854 --> 00:16:10,219
readers to connect with these otherwise perfect
characters. And it's a component that was noticeably

175
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:15,284
lacking in Zack Snyder's take on the character,
or from any other medium other than maybe Smallville

176
00:16:15,304 --> 00:16:20,989
for decades. I would argue that this show nails
the romantic aspect between Superman and Lois.

177
00:16:21,442 --> 00:16:26,664
than any film or television series in history
because of the novel approach they take with

178
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:33,107
the Clark Kent alter ego. His awkwardness in
this show isn't necessarily an act like it

179
00:16:33,147 --> 00:16:37,409
was for the Christopher Reeve version of the
character. It's often been debated amongst

180
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:43,431
comic readers whether Clark Kent should be an
act, and in this show we see that Clark Kent

181
00:16:43,491 --> 00:16:49,074
and Superman are essentially the same person.
It's just that Clark Kent is clumsy, due to

182
00:16:49,094 --> 00:16:54,476
having to control and hide his powers at all
times, which is difficult to do when his attention

183
00:16:54,636 --> 00:17:01,139
is on a pretty girl like Lois. I'm not usually
one for romantic media, I'll admit that. I

184
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:09,923
think my tastes as a hyper-masculine dude is
pretty much in the vein of, you know, I like

185
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:14,245
to see the action aspect of these superheroes.
The romantic side never really interested me.

186
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:19,459
But You know, I think that Superman actually
has one of the most interesting romantic angles

187
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:24,801
out of all superheroes in general. Yeah, I mean,
his romantic relationships, and I guess not

188
00:17:24,841 --> 00:17:29,622
just that, his relationships in general are
the source of his vulnerability, right? And

189
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:34,203
plus, like Superman's really only loved one
girl for the most part. I think he's had some

190
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:39,545
a few other romantic interests in his history,
but for the most part, Lois is Superman's girl

191
00:17:39,865 --> 00:17:44,488
ever since the 1940s, you know. Whereas I think
most other male superheroes have quite a number

192
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:49,713
of romantic interests, like another prime example
is Spider-Man, but he's had Gwen Stacy, Mary

193
00:17:49,753 --> 00:17:55,719
Jane, Felicia Hardy, you know? Spider-Man's
a ho! It's much more wholesome, I think, with

194
00:17:55,859 --> 00:18:00,343
the Superman-Lowes relationship. Absolutely,
yeah. Now, there was a lot of length, but that

195
00:18:00,363 --> 00:18:04,467
was in high school. You know, since becoming
an adult, Superman is primarily a wood woman

196
00:18:04,507 --> 00:18:09,826
man. Now, the show is so well written. And the
chemistry between the characters of Superman

197
00:18:09,846 --> 00:18:15,128
and Lois is so well realized that even though
Lois discovers Clark Kent as Superman less

198
00:18:15,148 --> 00:18:20,349
than halfway through the series, it doesn't
ruin the dramatic flow and tension between

199
00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:25,551
the characters. And it even helps address a
criticism many have levied at the writers of

200
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:31,012
Lois Lane for decades in that if she's such
an intelligent investigative journalist, why

201
00:18:31,052 --> 00:18:37,803
didn't she deduce that Clark Kent was Superman
early on? Here she does. and in a more believable

202
00:18:37,903 --> 00:18:43,527
and natural way than, say, Amy Adams' version
of the character. The way the showrunners approached

203
00:18:43,587 --> 00:18:48,371
the relationship between Clark and Lois wasn't
the only novel aspect of the show, however,

204
00:18:48,771 --> 00:18:54,875
the most blatant being the anime animation style.
We saw shades of the anime style in the DC

205
00:18:54,935 --> 00:18:59,019
animated movie universe that began with the
Justice League The Flashpoint Paradox animated

206
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:04,859
film, but my adventures with Superman is, for
the most part, a shounen anime in terms of

207
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:10,543
both animation and story style. Shounen animes
are geared toward teenage boys and include

208
00:19:10,603 --> 00:19:17,128
tropes such as growing in power like leveling
up, having a romantic rival, themes of teamwork,

209
00:19:17,168 --> 00:19:22,411
and the power of friendship, many of which are
found in this show. I love that for almost

210
00:19:22,551 --> 00:19:27,135
every villain that Superman went up against,
Lois and Jimmy were on the sidelines figuring

211
00:19:27,175 --> 00:19:31,534
out how to help Superman, whether it was pushing
buttons on a crate or... you know, finding

212
00:19:31,574 --> 00:19:36,896
the off switch for a high tech panic room. Yeah,
the anime art style was pretty well done here.

213
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:41,958
I never knew how well suited the character of
Superman was to the anime style until I saw

214
00:19:42,158 --> 00:19:47,040
it. And it works really damn well. Yeah, there's
a lot of visual anime tropes on the show as

215
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:53,563
well. You know, such as Superman sparking with
electricity like Goku or the Majoko style transformation

216
00:19:53,863 --> 00:19:58,145
into a super suit. There's a teaser for the
next episode at the very end of the one you're

217
00:19:58,165 --> 00:20:03,672
watching. And you know, overall the fast action
and exaggerated facial expressions. I don't

218
00:20:03,712 --> 00:20:09,136
watch a lot of anime, but I do know that some
of my favorites, like Neon Genesis Evangelion,

219
00:20:09,496 --> 00:20:15,159
My Hero Academia, and Sword Art Online, would
be considered shounen. And recognizing some

220
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:20,482
of those anime tropes, both story and visual,
was part of the fun of watching this show.

221
00:20:20,823 --> 00:20:25,425
I never would have thought, like you, that Superman
would have worked in that style, but he totally

222
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:30,685
did. For sure. And going back to the romantic
angle, I think for some reason, the anime art

223
00:20:30,705 --> 00:20:36,569
style does a really good job of expressing that
sort of like shy, flirtatious behavior between

224
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:40,211
characters. Yeah. You know, with like the blush
cheeks and everything like that, it just worked

225
00:20:40,251 --> 00:20:46,055
really well in selling their romantic back and
forth in an endearing way. Yeah, totally. Japanese

226
00:20:46,075 --> 00:20:51,058
shounen don't really shy away from romance in
the same way that I think Western cartoons

227
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:58,374
geared towards young men do. It was like, oh,
they love each other. I was like, he likes

228
00:20:58,434 --> 00:21:04,656
her, oh no. No, my daughter loves this series
as well. She's 12 years old. She's in middle

229
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:10,197
school. She watched the new episodes before
I did. She was like really into it. Girls love

230
00:21:10,237 --> 00:21:14,819
anime, I found. Yeah. And I think a large part
of it has to do with, yeah, they don't shy

231
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:20,220
away from things like romance. Now, as a Superman
fan, one of the things I loved most about this

232
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,646
show was the approach it took with Superman's
origin and how it resulted week to week. and

233
00:21:25,686 --> 00:21:31,528
a who's who of supervillains from DC Comics.
In a similar way to how Kryptonite was responsible

234
00:21:31,548 --> 00:21:36,710
for creating many of Superman's villains in
the Smallville television series, in this show,

235
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:42,533
many of them are powered by repurposed Kryptonian
technology. Superman doesn't realize this until

236
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:47,635
the very end of the season, so he doesn't have
like that same guilt that Clark did in Smallville,

237
00:21:47,935 --> 00:21:52,337
but I'm sure that's coming next season. Some
people got tired of the Kryptonite villain

238
00:21:52,357 --> 00:21:57,532
of the week, Shtick from Smallville. But since
my adventures with Superman was only 10 episodes,

239
00:21:57,672 --> 00:22:02,896
I didn't feel that aspect overstayed its welcome.
And it helped story-wise in coming up with

240
00:22:02,936 --> 00:22:08,060
a simple solution for why all of these superpowered
beings emerged for Superman to fight. We got

241
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:16,246
to see Livewire, Silver Banshee, Mist, Rough
House, Dr. Ivo, Parasite, Heatwave, Deathstroke,

242
00:22:16,546 --> 00:22:23,306
Mixi Spidlic, Amanda Waller, Lex Luthor, Omac
Robots, General Lane and even Matsumura Mala

243
00:22:23,386 --> 00:22:29,528
and the Brain. At the very end, we even get
teases of Brainiac and Zod. None of these characters

244
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:36,090
get much character development, and it shouldn't
work because of that, but it somehow does because

245
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:41,892
of the way all of the villains get their powers
and because the show is so focused on Superman

246
00:22:41,972 --> 00:22:47,993
and his friends. Yeah, I think the tech aspect
goes a long way in making the show feel modern.

247
00:22:48,354 --> 00:22:52,556
as well. A lot of the bad guys almost seem like
Iron Man or something like that, you know?

248
00:22:53,276 --> 00:22:58,819
But it doesn't feel untrue to the characters
themselves. Like Livewire, I think she was

249
00:22:58,879 --> 00:23:05,803
actually a villain introduced in the Superman
animated series from the 90s. But her origin

250
00:23:05,863 --> 00:23:09,205
here, I think is actually better than the one
they introduced in that old cartoon. And you're

251
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:13,868
right, it was fun going like, oh, that's Livewire.
Oh, that's Deathstroke. It's funny how like,

252
00:23:14,308 --> 00:23:17,766
I was so ready to write off the show in the
beginning. Cause I thought that was lame. I

253
00:23:17,786 --> 00:23:20,988
was like, what the fuck are they doing? Like
reinventing all these characters. And I was

254
00:23:21,008 --> 00:23:25,632
like, this is just some else world's bullshit.
But by the end I was like, man, this would

255
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:31,796
be a great angle for a film adaptation, honestly.
Oh man, don't even get me started. Like I liked

256
00:23:31,836 --> 00:23:36,540
this show so much that it actually got me a
little depressed by how good it was. Because

257
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:42,464
like most DC animations, I don't understand
why Warner Brothers couldn't adapt this approach

258
00:23:42,524 --> 00:23:48,034
for live action, you know? Like each of these
episodes were only 22 minutes long. This could

259
00:23:48,054 --> 00:23:52,636
have easily been a pair of films, maybe even
a trilogy. And that would have been amazing.

260
00:23:53,036 --> 00:23:58,297
Like whatever James Gunn is doing with the Superman
legacy film, the bar has been set for how well

261
00:23:58,317 --> 00:24:03,719
you could introduce Superman already right now.
It does have its work cut out for it in telling

262
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:08,900
Superman's early years better than this show
did. Right. Exactly. And it's been said that,

263
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:14,471
you know, it's not focusing on Superman's early
years as Superman. but it is supposed to focus

264
00:24:14,491 --> 00:24:19,655
on his early years in Metropolis with Lois Lane
and stuff like that. So, I don't know. Maybe

265
00:24:19,695 --> 00:24:24,619
he could go like the Superman birthright route
in that regard, but we'll see, I guess. For

266
00:24:24,699 --> 00:24:29,723
my money, this was a better modern adaptation
of the character of Superman than the Man of

267
00:24:29,783 --> 00:24:35,588
Steel movie, which I thought was an interesting,
you know, alien sci-fi approach to the character.

268
00:24:36,028 --> 00:24:41,152
You know, I love Man of Steel. It's one of my
favorite DC movies, and I would agree with

269
00:24:41,192 --> 00:24:47,467
you. That's why I'm depressed. But moving on
to the character breakdown, there's really

270
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:53,130
only three main characters to talk about. Of
course, starting with Superman, aka Clark Kent,

271
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:58,852
he was voiced by Jack Quaid, who's the son of
Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid, and is probably

272
00:24:58,912 --> 00:25:04,574
best well known for playing Huey and the boys.
It's a lighter, more comedic take on Superman,

273
00:25:04,934 --> 00:25:10,417
but I thought Jack nailed this version of the
character. I've never heard or seen Superman

274
00:25:10,497 --> 00:25:15,403
to be this expressive on screen. Oh, he was
incredible. I didn't even know that was him.

275
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:19,026
And now I'm kind of blown away by that. Yeah,
yeah. I didn't realize it was him either. He's

276
00:25:19,046 --> 00:25:25,331
pretty talented. Now, the show asks numerous
times, who is Superman? Superman asks himself

277
00:25:25,351 --> 00:25:30,395
that question. As we see each of Superman's
powers activate during the course of the show,

278
00:25:30,875 --> 00:25:37,540
he learns that he's a hero who simply does what
he can to help others. A good example of this

279
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:42,236
is when he steps in front of Lois. to shield
her from a barrage of lasers without thinking,

280
00:25:42,476 --> 00:25:48,001
without even knowing that he was invulnerable
to them. Superman being a hero isn't the most

281
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:53,266
shocking answer to the question of who he is.
The bigger shock comes from the angle they

282
00:25:53,306 --> 00:25:59,432
took in showing us that not only are some supermen
across the multiverse seemingly evil, but they

283
00:25:59,512 --> 00:26:01,694
also make us believe for a time that

284
00:26:05,778 --> 00:26:09,681
Yeah, there's an aspect to the show that was
kind of reminiscent of the invincible comic

285
00:26:09,721 --> 00:26:14,325
book series and animated show on Amazon, where
they portrayed the Kryptonians almost like

286
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:19,369
Viltrumites, where like they're these super
powerful beings. And I think Jor-El in this

287
00:26:19,429 --> 00:26:25,234
show can almost be seen as an analog to invincible's
father Omniman. I thought that was really fascinating,

288
00:26:25,734 --> 00:26:30,038
even though we know that Jor-El is ultimately
going to be a good guy. But then you have Zod

289
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:35,454
at the end. Right. Yeah. So cool. I can't wait
for season two. And I think that's a testament

290
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:40,616
to just how good this show is. I spoke earlier
about how like this show does a better job

291
00:26:40,697 --> 00:26:45,379
of bringing the character into modern times
while making him feel like Superman. Yes, like

292
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:50,801
a young classic version of Superman in the modern
day. And they never thought that they would

293
00:26:50,841 --> 00:26:55,764
be able to do that as successfully as they did
here. I think that's really why I was so happy

294
00:26:55,804 --> 00:27:01,106
with the show by the end of it, because it proved
that it could be done. Right. Like Henry Cavill's

295
00:27:01,206 --> 00:27:05,669
Superman was a little bit dark for some people's
tastes. He was a little bit brooding. You cannot

296
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:11,473
say that about this animated version of Superman.
Should have been live action. Damn it. Moving

297
00:27:11,533 --> 00:27:17,357
on to Lois Lane, she was voiced by Alice Lee,
a singer and actress from Zoe's Extraordinary

298
00:27:17,397 --> 00:27:23,361
Playlist. I never saw the show. Alice is of
Korean descent and her version of Lois Lane.

299
00:27:23,926 --> 00:27:28,169
is also of Korean descent and I believe this
is the first time we've ever seen the character

300
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:32,952
depicted that way. And I don't mind it, you
know, they also race-bent Jimmy Olsen to match

301
00:27:33,052 --> 00:27:38,276
his voice actor, and we'll talk about that character
in a bit, but I think matching the ethnicity

302
00:27:38,316 --> 00:27:44,000
of the voice actor best suited for the role
is admirable. And I have to say, I loved the

303
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:48,983
voice work for Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen. Oh
yeah, they did a perfect job. Now, Lois's arc

304
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:54,130
really revolves around her relationship with
her father. She disdains him for keeping secrets

305
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:59,293
from her growing up about his classified work
and her mother's cancer, and she struggles

306
00:27:59,313 --> 00:28:05,295
to find success in part due to feelings of neglect
from him ignoring her growing up. I think it

307
00:28:05,335 --> 00:28:09,817
was brilliant that they made her father, General
Lane, the primary villain. I thought it was

308
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:15,359
going to be like Lex Luthor or maybe Brainiac,
but having it be General Lane added a whole

309
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:21,214
other layer of conflict to the relationship
between Superman and Lois. I mean, who didn't

310
00:28:21,254 --> 00:28:26,155
see that coming? But also, yeah, brilliant idea.
I mean, I didn't initially until we actually

311
00:28:26,255 --> 00:28:32,597
saw him. I was like, oh, shit. Nice. I did kind
of roll my eyes when we learned that there

312
00:28:32,617 --> 00:28:37,699
was a multiversal league of Lois Lane's because
we've seen that done so many times by this

313
00:28:37,739 --> 00:28:44,641
point. Like Council of Rick's Council of Reed
Richards, you know. But after a while, I realized

314
00:28:44,701 --> 00:28:49,747
it was a clever way. to not only add further
tension to Superman and Lois's relationship

315
00:28:49,927 --> 00:28:55,149
and introduce Kryptonite, but also to qualm
any haters who may have an issue with this

316
00:28:55,189 --> 00:29:00,751
adaptation of the world of Superman, or even
the race-bending, by saying that this is its

317
00:29:00,891 --> 00:29:07,573
own thing, its own world. Your classic Superman
world still exists, but this is our interpretation

318
00:29:07,793 --> 00:29:12,576
and our stance. There's a little bit of the
Manic Pixie Dream Girl characterization here,

319
00:29:12,616 --> 00:29:18,040
especially in the early episodes for Lois Lane,
but Lois Lane is kind of like the OG Manic

320
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:23,964
Pixie Dream Girl. She's always been this like
borderline insane woman who will always be

321
00:29:24,004 --> 00:29:27,986
impulsive and go out and do the dangerous thing.
Right. And that's also an anime trope, you

322
00:29:28,006 --> 00:29:33,110
know, the wild impulsive anime girl. And I really
liked how they kind of blended that characterization

323
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:38,553
into this version of Lois Lane. For sure. Yeah.
She was really well done. As was Jimmy Olsen.

324
00:29:38,934 --> 00:29:44,115
He was voiced by Ishmael Saheed, and I have
to say I haven't enjoyed Jimmy Olsen this much

325
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:51,297
in a long while. It's always been hard to sincerely
say that Jimmy Olsen is Superman's best pal

326
00:29:51,317 --> 00:29:56,338
in the comics, because he's always been like
this dimwitted and somewhat annoying peon of

327
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:02,240
sorts. But here they made Clark and Jimmy bros,
like equals, who were friends even before they

328
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:08,061
arrived at the Daily Planet. And on top of that,
they made Jimmy a conspiracy theorist vlogger.

329
00:30:08,534 --> 00:30:13,596
which was a brilliant way to add tension to
him and Clark. Yeah, at first I thought it

330
00:30:13,616 --> 00:30:19,098
was just like this random character trait that
was done for comedic relief. And I was prepared

331
00:30:19,138 --> 00:30:23,940
to be really annoyed by Jimmy Olsen actually.
And then I kind of saw how all the pieces fell

332
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:28,722
together as Clark always found himself nervous
around Jimmy because Clark is an alien, you

333
00:30:28,742 --> 00:30:32,724
know? Right. So it was pretty interesting. Again,
you know, there's an anime trope of like the

334
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:37,978
comedic relief character that this version of
Jimmy Olsen fell squarely into, but uh... The

335
00:30:38,078 --> 00:30:43,181
way that the show was able to fill those molds
while still staying true to the Superman mythos

336
00:30:43,581 --> 00:30:49,204
was just brilliant. Yeah, I mean, tropes and
cliches exist for a reason. And when they're

337
00:30:49,244 --> 00:30:53,707
well done, they're really well done. Now, I
don't know how I feel about the reveal that

338
00:30:53,767 --> 00:30:59,630
Jimmy recognized that Clark was an alien early
on as roommates, but I guess it makes sense

339
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:05,493
considering they were living together. And it
also shows how true of a friend Jimmy was in

340
00:31:05,533 --> 00:31:11,788
that. as a vlogger about aliens, he wouldn't
expose Clark as one. Like if that isn't the

341
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:16,930
sign of a true friend, I don't know what is.
My impression is that it was his realization

342
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:22,613
that Clark was like a super strong alien guy
that manifested his whole conspiratorial nature

343
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:28,035
to begin with. Oh interesting, maybe. He's like
holy crap this guy's like superhuman, the fantastical

344
00:31:28,075 --> 00:31:32,877
must exist, and I must learn all about it. I
love that, that's great. Let's move on to the

345
00:31:32,917 --> 00:31:33,737
story highlights.

346
00:31:41,418 --> 00:31:46,879
In episode 1, titled Adventures of a Normal
Man, part 1, in Smallville, Kansas, a young

347
00:31:46,959 --> 00:31:52,381
Clark Kent awakens the power of flight and strength
to save a woman and her baby from a car accident.

348
00:31:52,921 --> 00:31:58,562
Years later, in Metropolis, Clark and his roommate
Jimmy Olsen, a photography student and alien

349
00:31:58,602 --> 00:32:04,604
conspiracy theorist, start their first day as
interns for the Daily Planet. Assigned to senior

350
00:32:04,684 --> 00:32:09,905
intern Lois Lane, she deceives them into helping
her investigate a military-grade technology

351
00:32:09,965 --> 00:32:15,608
theft. With a lead from Flip Johnson's News
Kid Legion, the trio finds the thieves loading

352
00:32:15,688 --> 00:32:22,232
military robots at the docks. The thieves' leader,
Leslie Willis, unleashes a robot to attack

353
00:32:22,252 --> 00:32:28,056
them. Clark gets out of view and returns in
disguise to destroy it. As Willis activates

354
00:32:28,096 --> 00:32:33,959
the remaining robots to battle Clark, Lois successfully
deactivates them while he awakens his super

355
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:40,163
speed to destroy the final robot. Despite their
efforts, Editor-in-Chief Perry White refuses

356
00:32:40,203 --> 00:32:45,947
to publish the story based on Jimmy's blurry
photos without real proof of the new metahuman

357
00:32:45,987 --> 00:32:51,711
that Lois dubbed Superman. Once the trio become
friends, Lois invites the boys to help her

358
00:32:51,751 --> 00:32:57,615
get an exclusive interview with Superman. Now,
I'll admit this first episode I did not love.

359
00:32:57,855 --> 00:33:03,459
When it came to the wacky, you know, Jimmy Olsen
hijinks, the manic characterization of Lois

360
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:08,786
and like the kids' newspaper brigade or whatever.
I was like, God. I didn't... Why are we reviewing

361
00:33:08,826 --> 00:33:13,628
this? Like, I would have rather have reviewed
the live-action Superman and Lois television

362
00:33:13,668 --> 00:33:16,970
series is what I thought to myself or something
like that, you know, because I've heard that's

363
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:22,352
good. But to the show's credit, as the show
progresses, it gets more serious along the

364
00:33:22,392 --> 00:33:27,614
way, which I think resulted in nice growth for
the characters. Yeah, true. Like you, I wasn't

365
00:33:27,854 --> 00:33:32,276
thrilled by this first episode. Like, I didn't
think it was the greatest adaptation ever for

366
00:33:32,316 --> 00:33:38,058
Superman. I didn't really feel that way until
maybe episode three or four. But episode 2

367
00:33:38,078 --> 00:33:43,822
was pretty good. That was titled Adventures
of a Normal Man, part 2. While Lois doggedly

368
00:33:43,862 --> 00:33:49,466
follows up on the robot theft for a lead to
Superman, Clark returns to Smallville to investigate

369
00:33:49,506 --> 00:33:55,150
his past and understand his new powers. Digging
up the space pod that delivered him to Earth,

370
00:33:55,530 --> 00:34:02,135
Clark activates an alien hologram and sees visions
of an alien planet amid a space war being destroyed.

371
00:34:02,635 --> 00:34:08,692
After Clark gains new alien clothing from this,
His mother, Martha, adds a belt and shorts

372
00:34:08,732 --> 00:34:14,677
to complete the look. Meanwhile, Willis is hunted
by the organization she stole the robot technology

373
00:34:14,717 --> 00:34:21,684
from, Task Force X, and arranges a meeting with
leading agent Slade Wilson, aka Deathstroke.

374
00:34:22,164 --> 00:34:26,608
When Willis threatens to detonate explosives
across the city sewers if they continue hunting

375
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:32,133
her, Lois and Jimmy's surprise interruption
turns the meeting into a scramble for the detonator.

376
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:37,452
Willis reveals her electrical super suit to
fight Deathstroke until Superman arrives to

377
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:43,616
subdue her. Deathstroke damages her suit's power
crystal, leading Superman to destroy it after

378
00:34:43,656 --> 00:34:49,019
it gives him another vision of the space war.
Though Jimmy's clear photos convince Perry

379
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:55,982
to publish the story, he gives the byline to
uninvolved staff reporters. Later, Deathstroke

380
00:34:56,023 --> 00:35:02,214
tortures Willis, now Livewire, at a black site
for information about Superman. I've seen a

381
00:35:02,274 --> 00:35:07,319
lot of flack online for the transformation scene
in this episode, and I really feel like early

382
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:11,903
on when the show's first episodes were coming
out, there was a lot of antagonism towards

383
00:35:11,983 --> 00:35:18,009
it. But I am happy to see more and more people
admit that they liked the series online. Well,

384
00:35:18,069 --> 00:35:22,834
I mean, it just made sense for the context of
the scene, right? Clark activating the ship

385
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:27,330
for the first time and going down into it and
seeing partial visions of the Kryptonian. story

386
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:31,774
and you know getting a suit from that I think
worked really well. And yeah like it's kind

387
00:35:31,814 --> 00:35:37,959
of a funny anime cliche for the characters to
suit up in this overtly grandiose fashion but

388
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,062
considering it only happened once in the season
and it had that context to go with it I thought

389
00:35:42,082 --> 00:35:46,186
it was spot on. Yeah I don't even think it was
that over the top either. It literally only

390
00:35:46,226 --> 00:35:52,371
lasted five seconds, maybe not even that long.
Yeah. I do love the fact that Martha helped

391
00:35:52,411 --> 00:35:56,190
contribute to the suit in some way because in
the comics... She did, you know, she helped

392
00:35:56,210 --> 00:36:00,734
him make it and design it. Yeah. So that was
cool. It really only took me up until this

393
00:36:00,794 --> 00:36:05,939
episode to start getting into the show. Once
you kind of saw what they did with LiveWire,

394
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:10,043
something kind of like clicked for me and I
understood what they were going with in terms

395
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:16,228
of bringing in the larger DC universe. Right,
yeah. We've begun to episode three, titled

396
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:21,851
My Interview with Superman. While Lois attempts
to interview Superman, Clark struggles to figure

397
00:36:21,951 --> 00:36:27,494
out how to help her while protecting his secret
identity. However, the interns must also contend

398
00:36:27,734 --> 00:36:33,357
with the Daily Planet's established Scoop Troop
reporters, who pericredited for their Superman

399
00:36:33,397 --> 00:36:39,500
story. Specifically, Steve Lombard, Kent Grant,
and Ronnie Troop. Meanwhile, Myst and his friend

400
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:44,947
Ruff House use technology they obtained from
Livewire to break his sister, Chauvin McDougal,

401
00:36:45,187 --> 00:36:50,391
out of prison and equip her with sonic tech
to rebuild their small time crew, Intergang.

402
00:36:50,711 --> 00:36:56,335
Despite Clark's misgivings, the interns impersonate
the Scoop Troop to investigate Chauvin, now

403
00:36:56,375 --> 00:37:02,019
Silver Banshee, discovering a clue to Intergang's
next heist. When Intergang attempts to rob

404
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:07,683
the Metropolitan City Bank, their ice cannon's
power crystal malfunctions and begins to freeze

405
00:37:07,743 --> 00:37:13,078
everything in proximity. Seeing Lois and Jimmy
in danger, Superman awakens his heat vision

406
00:37:13,338 --> 00:37:19,640
and destroys the crystal, granting him a vision
of an invading robot army. While Deathstroke's

407
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:25,061
organization secretly takes the defeated Inter
Gang members into custody, Superman accepts

408
00:37:25,101 --> 00:37:31,083
Lois' interview and discloses that he is still
figuring himself out, but is committed to saving

409
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:37,445
people. However, to his dismay, Lois later tells
Clark that she suspects Superman is lying.

410
00:37:37,965 --> 00:37:42,266
Now, when I first saw Inter Gang pop up here,
I was guessing that the main villain was going

411
00:37:42,287 --> 00:37:46,989
to be Darkseid and that this was apocalyptic
tech, but that turned out to not be the case.

412
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:53,333
Right, because traditionally, intergang is supplied
with new god technology, right? I do like the

413
00:37:53,353 --> 00:37:56,495
way they kind of flipped it here so that it
was Kryptonian tech though. I think it still

414
00:37:56,515 --> 00:38:02,958
worked. Yeah, I agree. I also think it's interesting
how crystals power Kryptonian tech. You know,

415
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:09,386
Sunstone is a thing in the comics. We saw that
in the Superman movie as well. where like all

416
00:38:09,426 --> 00:38:14,788
the architecture and stuff is created from crystals.
So it was nice that they found a way to incorporate

417
00:38:15,088 --> 00:38:21,051
crystals and even kryptonite as a crystal into
Superman's mythos. Yeah, when Superman destroyed

418
00:38:21,111 --> 00:38:26,553
the ice crystal with his heat vision, that's
when I recognized the shonen tropes of him

419
00:38:26,593 --> 00:38:32,016
like leveling up to face new challenges throughout
the course of each episode. I thought that

420
00:38:32,036 --> 00:38:37,506
was really neat. It's really interesting. It's
still not entirely clear how his. new powers

421
00:38:37,546 --> 00:38:41,708
were unlocked, he kind of just like sparked
with electricity and then boom, had a new power.

422
00:38:42,229 --> 00:38:46,751
But I thought it was cool and I thought it worked.
I have a feeling maybe Jor-El was kind of keeping

423
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:52,574
tabs on his son and would unlock new powers
as he needed them. Episode 4 was titled, Let's

424
00:38:52,594 --> 00:38:58,538
Go to Ivo Tower, You Say. Perry assigns the
interns to cover the Amazotech Gala, held by

425
00:38:58,618 --> 00:39:05,374
CEO Dr. Anthony Ivo. Lois is snubbed by the
attendees for her invasive questions. while

426
00:39:05,414 --> 00:39:10,778
Clark stumbles upon an argument between Ivo
and his chairman, Curtis, regarding the board

427
00:39:10,798 --> 00:39:17,784
of directors voting out Ivo. Ejected by Ivo's
security, Lois sneaks Clark back inside. They

428
00:39:17,884 --> 00:39:23,829
open up to each other before discovering a secret
room with technology that connects Ivo to Livewire

429
00:39:23,969 --> 00:39:30,455
and Intergang. An angered Ivo demonstrates the
Parasite 1.0 armor and attempts to kill Chairman

430
00:39:30,495 --> 00:39:36,763
Curtis. Clark becomes Superman to save Curtis,
and while Ivo traps the attendees in the Amazo

431
00:39:36,803 --> 00:39:42,708
Panic Room to make them witness him overpowering
Superman. Realizing the armor absorbs energy

432
00:39:42,768 --> 00:39:48,652
from his attacks, Superman stops fighting Ivo
directly as Lois and Jimmy deactivate the panic

433
00:39:48,712 --> 00:39:54,436
room. With the suit depowered, Superman removes
it from Ivo, who became deformed due to the

434
00:39:54,496 --> 00:40:00,560
suit's side effects. With Ivo under EMT care,
the interns return to find the secret room

435
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:07,125
empty. Lois kisses Clark, considering the night
a date night. Later, after submitting her expose

436
00:40:07,165 --> 00:40:13,590
on Ivo, Lois finds a torn tabloid article involving
Kansas' miracle sightings in Clark's coat.

437
00:40:14,191 --> 00:40:20,756
After reworking her evidence board, Lois concludes
that Clark is Superman. Now, Ivo was the one

438
00:40:21,256 --> 00:40:26,561
villain, I think, that they really didn't do
justice, or I should say parasites. Professor

439
00:40:26,661 --> 00:40:31,985
Ivo in the comics, of course, is a mad scientist
of sorts who is responsible for the creation

440
00:40:32,618 --> 00:40:37,862
villainous robots such as a mezzo. Parasite
is his own villain. For some reason, they decided

441
00:40:37,902 --> 00:40:43,086
to merge the two here and I really didn't care
for the character design. I don't understand

442
00:40:43,167 --> 00:40:49,352
why it needed a tail of all things. It was weird.
Yeah, Parasite has never traditionally been

443
00:40:49,392 --> 00:40:55,437
depicted as a tech. I mean, a lot of Superman's
villains are not tech based, although you could

444
00:40:55,497 --> 00:40:59,941
rationalize a lot of their abilities as tech
oriented. Take for example, Silver Banshee,

445
00:40:59,961 --> 00:41:05,678
which I thought was Well done. Parasite, I'm
not quite so sure, successfully makes the transition

446
00:41:05,738 --> 00:41:09,863
over to Tech Villain. Although, you know, the
whole power draining aspect of it made sense

447
00:41:09,883 --> 00:41:16,429
for me, but the weird, like, tail and insectoid
elements of the armor didn't quite make sense.

448
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:21,795
I also thought that they really played a little
bit probably too heavily off of Tony Stark

449
00:41:21,935 --> 00:41:28,552
for Ivo, making Kim like this. you know, celebrity
CEO on Playboy. I don't know, I think they

450
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:33,594
could have done a better job although I do appreciate
the effort, I suppose. By this episode, with

451
00:41:33,694 --> 00:41:38,497
Alex making an appearance, you know, Ivo's like
scientist assistant, I totally thought that

452
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:43,220
the main bad guy of the season was going to
be Lex Luthor. What are your thoughts on the

453
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:48,423
show kind of like positioning Lex Luthor as
more of a secondary villain type? I don't mind

454
00:41:48,483 --> 00:41:55,298
it, honestly. Like, if you want to build up
Lex Luthor as a major antagonist, over a season

455
00:41:55,339 --> 00:42:01,003
or two, that's fine by me. Like give next season
to General Zod, maybe have Lex Luthor help

456
00:42:01,204 --> 00:42:06,008
defeat him in some way, but become bald in the
process and then have him be like the main

457
00:42:06,068 --> 00:42:10,111
villain by season three. That's that's fine.
Yeah, I think that totally works. I assume

458
00:42:10,131 --> 00:42:15,316
that they're going to have Alex take over his
former boss's company. Essentially, he's going

459
00:42:15,336 --> 00:42:21,301
to take over a Mazotech and turn it into Lex
Court or Lex Tech, one of those episode five

460
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:26,615
was titled. you will believe a man can lie.
Hoping to confess his burgeoning feelings for

461
00:42:26,675 --> 00:42:31,636
Lois, Clark asks for her help in developing
a story about the stolen military technology

462
00:42:31,976 --> 00:42:37,498
spreading throughout Metropolis and a mysterious
individual kidnapping anyone using it. However,

463
00:42:37,618 --> 00:42:42,599
she sees it as an opportunity to expose him
as Superman. Using an old dispatch scanner,

464
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:48,241
she chases down Superman as he foils various
crimes before eventually meeting him after

465
00:42:48,281 --> 00:42:53,868
he defeats Heatwave. another criminal empowered
by the stolen technology. While Superman is

466
00:42:53,888 --> 00:42:59,452
distracted, Heatwave escapes, believing he is
behind recent kidnappings of inter-gang members

467
00:42:59,712 --> 00:43:04,436
who have used the high-tech weaponry. After
Superman drops off Lois at the Daily Planet

468
00:43:04,476 --> 00:43:09,939
to keep her safe, he reconfronts Heatwave and
discovers the true culprit behind the abducted

469
00:43:09,999 --> 00:43:16,464
criminals is an armored Deathstroke aided by
similar robots that Livewire used. Their subsequent

470
00:43:16,524 --> 00:43:23,569
fight soon endangers civilians. leading to Deathstroke's
superiors, the General and Amanda Waller, ordering

471
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:29,294
him to withdraw so Superman can save them. After
returning to Lois, she forces Clark to reveal

472
00:43:29,334 --> 00:43:35,799
his secret identity to her and is left distraught.
Meanwhile, Jimmy is disappointed to learn that

473
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:40,622
Clark and Lois fail to attend a pre-planned
camping trip to investigate Bigfoot sightings

474
00:43:40,663 --> 00:43:46,262
with him. He goes alone, but a large gorilla
kidnaps him. I thought this was a pretty good

475
00:43:46,282 --> 00:43:51,505
episode both action wise and like drama wise.
I was actually surprised by the amount of drama

476
00:43:51,525 --> 00:43:56,908
they were able to milk out of the whole Superman
Clark Kent reveal to Lois Lane. Right? Yeah.

477
00:43:56,968 --> 00:44:02,251
This is one of my favorite episodes. There's
often criticism that, oh, you know, Lois Lane

478
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:08,114
should know that Superman is Clark Kent because
Superman is just Clark Kent without glasses.

479
00:44:08,415 --> 00:44:12,877
But I think this episode does a decent job of
sort of showing that Lois doesn't really get

480
00:44:12,937 --> 00:44:18,782
the best. looks at Superman. He's never around
enough for her to interact with him the way

481
00:44:18,802 --> 00:44:22,906
that she wants to. I mean, that all depends
on what version of Lois Lane you're talking

482
00:44:22,946 --> 00:44:27,209
about though, because like, if you look at Richard
Donner's movie, they had a whole like date

483
00:44:27,249 --> 00:44:31,333
night interviewed together, so she got a pretty
good look then. Margot Kidder should have known

484
00:44:31,353 --> 00:44:36,357
better. It's fair. Well, she did figure it out
in Superman 2 on her own. That's true. To be

485
00:44:36,397 --> 00:44:43,654
fair. Episode 6 was entitled, My Adventures
with Mad Science. After failing to locate Jimmy,

486
00:44:43,994 --> 00:44:50,036
Clark reaches out to Lois for help. Despite
still being mad at him, she agrees. Scouring

487
00:44:50,076 --> 00:44:56,118
the woods, the pair find an abandoned military
installation called Area 52, but upon crossing

488
00:44:56,158 --> 00:45:02,140
the fence, Clark's powers falter due to the
area being exposed to red solar radiation before

489
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:09,502
they are chased by OMAC robots. Meanwhile, inside
Area 52, Jimmy meets and befriends the gorilla

490
00:45:09,562 --> 00:45:15,523
Matsumala, and his partner, the Brain. The pair
reveal they originally worked for Project Cadmus,

491
00:45:15,823 --> 00:45:22,025
a branch of Task Force X that focused on developing
futuristic technology, before the latter organization

492
00:45:22,065 --> 00:45:27,907
betrayed them and raided Area 52. Ever since,
the Brain and Mala have been attempting to

493
00:45:27,947 --> 00:45:33,648
create a wormhole to access other dimensions
where they will be accepted. Eventually, breaching

494
00:45:33,748 --> 00:45:39,430
Area 52, Clark and Lois reconcile with each
other and Jimmy, who reveals he knew of Clark's

495
00:45:39,470 --> 00:45:45,413
secret identity all along, before joining Brain
and Mala in defeating the Omacs. Successfully

496
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:51,235
opening their wormhole, the Brain warns Clark
that Task Force X is after him before leaving

497
00:45:51,315 --> 00:45:57,478
with Mala. Concurrently, the General recruits
Ivo to help him use Cadmus' technology to kill

498
00:45:57,558 --> 00:46:03,861
Superman. This is one of the lesser episodes,
in my opinion, largely because of the characters

499
00:46:03,901 --> 00:46:08,215
amongst your Mala and the Brain. I know them
as Doom Patrol villains from the Brotherhood

500
00:46:08,255 --> 00:46:15,138
of Evil. Right. And they weren't very evil in
this reality. Well, no, I think a lot of the

501
00:46:15,198 --> 00:46:20,740
villains that were under the hands of Grant
Morrison were reinterpreted in a way that made

502
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:27,243
them less evil than they were prior, I would
say. Like he's the one who made Munsu Ramallah

503
00:46:27,383 --> 00:46:32,750
and the Brain lovers to begin with, which just
struck me as really weird in this show. Yeah,

504
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:38,535
especially considering that the brain was a
scientist that helped give Monsier Mala the

505
00:46:38,575 --> 00:46:43,539
gorilla his genius, and then fell in love with
him, which seems like a weird case of bestiality

506
00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:49,585
going on. Like, was he fucking that gorilla
the whole time? I hope not. I don't know if

507
00:46:49,625 --> 00:46:53,248
we want to be... He better not be. Right? Yeah,
like I didn't feel like comfortable with some

508
00:46:53,268 --> 00:46:58,592
of the implications of this episode. There's
definitely like a breach of ethics there somewhere.

509
00:46:59,153 --> 00:47:03,344
Anyway... Yeah, I didn't love what they did
with the Brandon Manseuramala. They're Doom

510
00:47:03,364 --> 00:47:08,388
Patrol villains again, so I'm not sure why they
were here in this episode. There are other

511
00:47:08,428 --> 00:47:12,552
villains from Project Cadmus that I think could
have worked here just as well. Can you explain

512
00:47:12,692 --> 00:47:18,477
why the area was doused in red solar radiation?
Cause I guess I didn't quite get that part

513
00:47:18,977 --> 00:47:23,921
or like why there were booby traps around as
the OMAX were chasing Lois and Clark through

514
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:29,181
the jungle. Well the booby traps were set up
to protect Mansuramala and the brain from Task

515
00:47:29,201 --> 00:47:35,626
Force X should they ever return to the base
of Area 52. I don't know what the red solar

516
00:47:35,646 --> 00:47:41,230
radiation thing was about, I also didn't catch
that. Again I don't think it was a great episode

517
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:46,374
because of unexplained things like that. I did
think the omacs were cool, and I was actually

518
00:47:46,394 --> 00:47:51,077
surprised to see them so soon after watching
Blue Beetle. Yeah they're like everywhere now.

519
00:47:52,146 --> 00:47:58,412
Episode 7 was titled Kiss Fallen Portal. After
Clark shows Lois and Jimmy his spaceship and

520
00:47:58,452 --> 00:48:04,538
clarifies his incomplete alien origin, Clark
and Lois plan their first date. However, he

521
00:48:04,578 --> 00:48:10,003
is interrupted by Mr. Myxhospitalik, a multiversal
imp who deceives him into helping him steal

522
00:48:10,083 --> 00:48:16,029
a recorder from a museum on Earth-1, revealing
Clark is from the planet Krypton in the process.

523
00:48:16,618 --> 00:48:21,361
Meanwhile, Lois and Jimmy are recruited by the
Multiversal League of Lois Lanes to help them

524
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:27,085
stop Mixy Spitalik and Clark. Suspicious of
their intentions, Lois searches their files,

525
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:33,609
stumbling onto the redacted File X. Upon finding
them, the League attacks Clark, while Mixy

526
00:48:33,629 --> 00:48:38,552
Spitalik hijacks the League's vessel and travels
to their headquarters with the recorder and

527
00:48:38,632 --> 00:48:45,237
Lois' help. As she steals the original File
X, Mixy Spitalik retrieves his hat, regains

528
00:48:45,277 --> 00:48:51,210
his full strength, and causes chaos until Superman
distracts him, allowing Lois to depower him

529
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:56,795
and Jimmy to restrain him. While the League
arrests Mixius Spidelik, Jimmy's counterpart,

530
00:48:56,915 --> 00:49:02,560
Jelena, secretly brings the interns back to
their native Earth-12, where Clark and Lois

531
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:08,685
finish their date. Following this, she opens
File X and finds recordings of evil alternate

532
00:49:08,765 --> 00:49:14,238
universe Superman and a sample of kryptonite
that the League used to injure him. I actually

533
00:49:14,298 --> 00:49:20,300
really like this interpretation of Miksi Spedulik,
and I never know if I'm pronouncing that correctly.

534
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:24,882
Well, that's how they pronounced it in the show.
Yeah, it was very different from other iterations

535
00:49:24,902 --> 00:49:29,024
of the character that I've seen. Typically he's
portrayed as like this impish looking character,

536
00:49:29,064 --> 00:49:34,666
but here he definitely had like mystic alien
influences. I thought he was more like a feline

537
00:49:34,866 --> 00:49:40,288
genie, which kind of made sense to me considering
that fifth dimensional imps in DC comics are

538
00:49:40,348 --> 00:49:45,523
often interpreted as genies like the thunderbolt.
I liked it. The hat didn't make sense, but

539
00:49:45,564 --> 00:49:50,588
I liked it. No, yeah, and the fact that he got
his powers from his hat, I thought was a little

540
00:49:50,608 --> 00:49:55,533
bit convenient. But no, there were a lot of
great references in this episode to alternate

541
00:49:55,653 --> 00:49:59,978
animated universe Superman that I appreciated.
I don't think he got his power from his hat.

542
00:50:00,338 --> 00:50:07,425
I just think he was in toll without his hat.
Okay, yeah. Episode 8 was titled Zero Day Part

543
00:50:07,725 --> 00:50:14,007
1. The General uses shock collars to forcibly
recruit Livewire, Intergang, and Heatwave into

544
00:50:14,047 --> 00:50:20,393
assisting Deathstroke and Ivo in capturing Superman.
Meanwhile, after developing Superhearing and

545
00:50:20,433 --> 00:50:25,457
sensing everyone in the city crying for help,
Clark runs himself ragged, helping everyone,

546
00:50:25,777 --> 00:50:31,182
and soon becomes sleep deprived and weakened.
When Gotham Gazette journalist Vicky Vail arrives

547
00:50:31,262 --> 00:50:36,871
to cover his activities, Lois is star-struck
to meet her. only to be disappointed when Vail

548
00:50:36,911 --> 00:50:42,715
runs a biased story defaming Superman as a menace
to gain a promotion. Superman saves an invisible

549
00:50:42,795 --> 00:50:48,219
Mist from being hit by a truck, but causes an
accident, turning public opinion against him.

550
00:50:48,619 --> 00:50:54,263
Mist says Task Force X kidnapped Silver Banshee,
and Superman offers to rescue her, only to

551
00:50:54,283 --> 00:50:59,227
be led into a trap and attacked by the group.
Though he holds his own despite his weakened

552
00:50:59,307 --> 00:51:06,004
state, Superman is eventually knocked out by
Ivo, via his upgraded parasite armor and livewire.

553
00:51:06,445 --> 00:51:11,630
The General stops Ivo from killing Superman
as he wants to interrogate him, Mr. Egress

554
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:16,895
luring Superman into the trap as Lois and Jimmy
rush to the scene but arrive to see the group

555
00:51:16,935 --> 00:51:22,020
carry Superman away. And this was cool, like
this was a way to introduce the Suicide Squad

556
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:27,605
without actually naming them as such. Just repurposing
all of the villains that they showcased throughout

557
00:51:27,645 --> 00:51:31,500
the season. I thought was pretty well done.
Yeah, and seeing Superman going up against

558
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:35,764
all of them was a lot of fun to watch. It's
like that video game that's never coming out.

559
00:51:35,924 --> 00:51:41,448
Suicide Squad killed the Justice League. Right,
right. The angle they took for this episode

560
00:51:41,508 --> 00:51:47,033
where his super hearing kind of creates this
vulnerability in that he struggles with being

561
00:51:47,133 --> 00:51:52,338
everywhere at once and therefore doesn't sleep
and therefore is less effective playing upon

562
00:51:52,538 --> 00:51:58,094
people's fears that are being stirred by this
new biased reporter. It all works really well

563
00:51:58,134 --> 00:52:02,695
together. The show can be really well written
at times. Most times, I would say. Yeah, I

564
00:52:02,755 --> 00:52:09,757
agree. Episode 9 was Zero Day Part 2. In flashbacks
to Zero Day, the General, Waller, and their

565
00:52:09,797 --> 00:52:16,299
forces were attacked by an alien army led by
a Superman-like figure codenamed Nemesis Omega

566
00:52:16,639 --> 00:52:22,581
before a mysterious event forced the army back
into a retreat that left their technology behind.

567
00:52:22,921 --> 00:52:27,491
In the present... The News Kid Legion helps
Lois and Jimmy search for Superman, while the

568
00:52:27,552 --> 00:52:33,275
General interrogates him for information on
Zero Day. From Superman's anguished reaction,

569
00:52:33,615 --> 00:52:38,918
the General doubts his connection to it, while
a displeased Waller secretly helps the prisoners

570
00:52:38,998 --> 00:52:46,482
escape, during which Livewire electrocutes Deathstroke's
right eye. A vengeful Ivo attacks Superman,

571
00:52:46,842 --> 00:52:52,890
but inadvertently frees him. Flip from the News
Kid Legion eventually finds Superman, and takes

572
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:59,011
him to safety. Clark believes he was sent to
Earth to destroy it, but Lois assures him otherwise.

573
00:52:59,571 --> 00:53:05,053
Upon learning Ivo is siphoning the power grid
and going on a Kaiju rampage through the city,

574
00:53:05,513 --> 00:53:10,495
Lois and Jimmy use social media to petition
Metropolis's citizens to turn off their power,

575
00:53:10,875 --> 00:53:16,796
weakening Ivo so Superman can use his newly
awakened x-ray vision to locate and remove

576
00:53:16,936 --> 00:53:24,516
Ivo from the suit. As Superman and Lois declare
their love, Jimmy Fine's File X. On Checkmate's

577
00:53:24,556 --> 00:53:30,780
behalf, Waller demotes the General and gives
him Ivo's last invention, the Omega Cannon,

578
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:38,465
with orders to kill Superman. And again, I didn't
love Ivo in this episode. The whole Kaiju parasite

579
00:53:38,505 --> 00:53:44,889
thing was recently done in Superman Man of Tomorrow.
So it wasn't like novel to see it done again.

580
00:53:45,354 --> 00:53:50,898
No, it was pretty cool how Superman's newly
gained ability of X-ray vision assisted in

581
00:53:51,078 --> 00:53:55,322
Parasite's defeat though. That was cool. Yeah,
I agree with that. I actually thought this

582
00:53:55,362 --> 00:54:00,106
was the season finale. I knew that there was
10 episodes, but for some reason I was like,

583
00:54:00,266 --> 00:54:05,150
oh, it must be a mistake. I think there's actually
only nine. So I was surprised and pleased to

584
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:10,474
see that there was episode 10 because I thought
episode 10 was great. Episode 10 was called

585
00:54:10,674 --> 00:54:16,470
Hearts of the Fathers. After having nightmares
about Zero Day. Clark is promoted, along with

586
00:54:16,570 --> 00:54:22,172
Lois and Jimmy, to full reporters for their
article on Ivo's defeat. They have Thanksgiving

587
00:54:22,232 --> 00:54:28,153
dinner with Clark's parents, and Lois invites
her father, Sam Lane, revealed to be the General,

588
00:54:28,453 --> 00:54:34,615
though he fails to recognize Clark. In private,
Clark finds File X and the Kryptonite Shard,

589
00:54:34,835 --> 00:54:40,397
which hurts him. His space pod reacts to the
Kryptonite, and releases a signal that prompts

590
00:54:40,437 --> 00:54:46,689
an invasion similar to Zero Day. Superman and
Sam battle the invaders, with Jimmy learning

591
00:54:46,729 --> 00:54:52,574
the kryptonite hurts them as well. Superman
takes the kryptonite and, despite being weakened,

592
00:54:53,034 --> 00:54:58,459
uses it to destroy the mothership, halting the
invasion. A hologram of his father helps return

593
00:54:58,479 --> 00:55:04,084
him to Earth. Sam prepares to kill him, but
Lois pleads for his life and reminds him that

594
00:55:04,104 --> 00:55:09,509
he just saved them, causing him to leave. Jimmy
reveals he sold his social media platform,

595
00:55:09,649 --> 00:55:16,265
Flamebird. to the daily planet for over 5 million
dollars and is now rich. On a distant world,

596
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:23,769
a robot seemingly brainiac informs his Kryptonian
master about the halted invasion. His master,

597
00:55:24,189 --> 00:55:30,252
seemingly General Zod, says that the rebellious
world will soon kneel. I thought this was a

598
00:55:30,313 --> 00:55:37,497
fantastic finale episode. The stakes were incredible.
The sacrifice of the hero, I thought, was profound.

599
00:55:37,857 --> 00:55:43,937
Great arc resolution. All around well done.
The action of this episode was fantastic. When

600
00:55:43,977 --> 00:55:49,642
he started throwing down in that spaceship corridor
with those robots, right, I was like, kick

601
00:55:49,682 --> 00:55:55,387
their asses, Superman. Superman gets his own
hallway fight scene. Yeah. I mean, the action

602
00:55:55,487 --> 00:56:00,532
overall is not really comparable to some of
the better anime action I've seen. I think

603
00:56:00,552 --> 00:56:05,636
that could have actually been done better in
the season. But I did really enjoy seeing Superman

604
00:56:05,676 --> 00:56:09,459
throw down with all these robots. That's what
the character is good for. You know, these

605
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:15,342
larger than life fights. Exactly. Yeah. Superman
has battles that no other superhero really

606
00:56:15,442 --> 00:56:21,105
can have. It's top tier for sure. I also loved
seeing Jor-El like help his son fight alongside

607
00:56:21,125 --> 00:56:24,827
him in the hallway, just like short circuiting
all those robots by zapping through them as

608
00:56:24,867 --> 00:56:31,891
a hologram. I was like, you go, Jor-El, you
go. I wasn't quite sure why Jor-El's recognition

609
00:56:31,911 --> 00:56:38,106
of the Kryptonite initiated a Kryptonian invasion,
but I am super interested in seeing why all

610
00:56:38,126 --> 00:56:42,610
of that happens the way it happens in season
two, when we get reintroduced to characters

611
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:47,994
like Brainiac and General Zod, and get the whole
missing side of the story there. Exactly, yeah,

612
00:56:48,114 --> 00:56:52,918
for sure. It almost seems like the ship woke
up in a response to the kryptonite for some

613
00:56:52,958 --> 00:56:58,083
reason, and there wasn't much that Jor-El could
do about it. I'm not sure. I did love the final

614
00:56:58,143 --> 00:57:03,627
line of Jimmy Olsen when he was like, oh yeah,
I'm rich now. My mouth went open just like

615
00:57:03,667 --> 00:57:08,274
everyone else's around the table, just like
what, what? It's definitely a fun angle for

616
00:57:08,314 --> 00:57:12,737
Jimmy Olsen, I think. For sure. Really interested
in seeing where that goes. Yeah, I'm interested

617
00:57:12,757 --> 00:57:18,140
in seeing where all of it goes, because this
series is just so refreshing as a DC fan and

618
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:24,123
a Superman fan in particular. It modernizes
the character in a way that, again, I didn't

619
00:57:24,143 --> 00:57:30,346
think could ever be done. It was this perfect
blend of anime action and romance, and the

620
00:57:30,366 --> 00:57:35,269
show's sleek character designs and charming
animation just successfully modernized Superman

621
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:41,794
and his friends. so well that I'm giving this
season four and a half out of five stars a

622
00:57:41,874 --> 00:57:46,778
fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Yeah I have
to agree with the four and a half star rating.

623
00:57:47,279 --> 00:57:52,503
I wasn't going that way at the beginning of
the season but one of the most impressive things

624
00:57:52,583 --> 00:57:57,928
about the show is how it managed to turn me.
My mind on what it was completely changed from

625
00:57:57,988 --> 00:58:02,531
beginning to end. Like at the start I was like
oh this is like some kid's show you know. I

626
00:58:02,551 --> 00:58:09,974
thought the characterizations were too and the
universe was too unrecognizable. But the characters

627
00:58:10,234 --> 00:58:15,819
really grew throughout the season, and I think
the universe that they built here came to be

628
00:58:16,099 --> 00:58:22,585
one of the more compelling iterations of the
Superman story ever. I agree. To me, it was

629
00:58:22,705 --> 00:58:26,708
near perfect. I think the worst thing you could
say about it is that the show doesn't do the

630
00:58:26,788 --> 00:58:32,593
best job of adapting lesser known Superman villains,
but they are lesser known Superman villains.

631
00:58:33,046 --> 00:58:39,531
It's not like they botched Zod or Brainiac or
Bizarro or something like that. These are Livewire

632
00:58:39,571 --> 00:58:44,754
and Heatwave. So I didn't mind the creative
liberty they took with the characters. And

633
00:58:44,875 --> 00:58:50,519
overall, fantastic show. Yeah, I hope the show
does well because I think that this version

634
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:56,603
of Superman will be to the 2020s that Smallville's
Clark Kent was to the early 2000s. I hope so.

635
00:58:57,084 --> 00:59:01,655
I hope so because Smallville was insanely popular.
And I hope for all the people who were maybe

636
00:59:01,835 --> 00:59:05,278
thinking about this show the same way we were
going into it, that it was, you know, just

637
00:59:05,298 --> 00:59:10,203
this kiddie show. Take the time to watch this
and really find something to admire like we

638
00:59:10,243 --> 00:59:14,787
did. But that does it for this review. Let us

649
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:14,804
going to find out who'd win in a fight between
Dorothy Spinner and Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur.

650
01:00:14,824 --> 01:00:19,086
Yeah, this is going to be a pretty interesting
match. The story of Dorothy Spinner is pretty

651
01:00:19,146 --> 01:00:23,429
tragic. I don't know much about Moon Girl and
Devil Dinosaur, but I'm definitely interested

652
01:00:23,469 --> 01:00:27,163
in seeing them throw down. But that does it
