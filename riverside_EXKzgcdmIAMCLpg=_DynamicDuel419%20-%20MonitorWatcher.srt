00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:28,647
Hey and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:28,747 --> 00:00:33,729
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters and stat-based

4
00:00:33,849 --> 00:00:40,132
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother Johnny DC. And in this episode,

5
00:00:40,492 --> 00:00:45,934
guys, we're going to find out who would win
in a fight between DC's The Monitor and Marvel's

6
00:00:46,435 --> 00:00:51,917
The Watcher. Now we're coming straight off of
our review of What If Season 3 in which The

7
00:00:51,977 --> 00:00:57,919
Watcher Uwatu plays a prominent role, and the
executive producers figured now was as good

8
00:00:57,959 --> 00:01:02,740
a time as any to use that character in a duel
and find out who would win when we put him

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,941
against DC's equivalent. Yeah, for a while there
we were considering doing anti-Monitor or maybe

10
00:01:08,002 --> 00:01:12,383
Metron against Watcher, but we voted on Monitor.
This speculation will get pretty interesting.

11
00:01:12,763 --> 00:01:16,484
Yeah, we'll find out who will win between those
two characters later on this episode. Before

12
00:01:16,524 --> 00:01:19,825
that, we're going to break down the comic book
movie news to come out this past week of which

13
00:01:19,865 --> 00:01:26,840
there was none. You get nothing. You stole fizzy
lifting drinks. Good day, sir. Yeah, there's

14
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,963
a ton of rumors going on out there right now
in regards to both the DCU and MCU, but nothing

15
00:01:32,003 --> 00:01:37,006
really concrete. We will be breaking down this
week's no prize winners and giving a question

16
00:01:37,026 --> 00:01:41,308
of the week though. As always, we list our segment

to the no prize. A No Prize is an award Marvel

38
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,211
used to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic
Duel No Prize, is a digital award that we pushed

39
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:44,293
on Instagram for the person we feel gave the
best answer to our question of the week. Last

40
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:52,575
week we asked you guys if you could recast any
other DCEU actor in a DCU role, who would it

41
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:57,717
be and why? And this is coming off the news
that Jason Momoa has been cast as Lobo in James

42
00:03:57,757 --> 00:04:04,063
Gunn's new DC movie universe. having previously
been in the DCEU of course as Aquaman. We got

43
00:04:04,103 --> 00:04:08,365
a total of four answers, so we have three honorable
mentions to go over before revealing this week's

44
00:04:08,445 --> 00:04:14,688
no-price winner. Our first honorable mention
goes to Colby Henches, who said, Hey boys,

45
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:21,311
Colby Henches. If any DCEU actor were coming
back, I'd like to see it be everybody's favorite

46
00:04:21,331 --> 00:04:27,493
Flash Thompson, Joe Manganiello. He only got
to be Deathstroke for like two seconds on screen.

47
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,252
I'd love to see him come back as Deathstroke,
but if we're recasting, I think he'd be a great

48
00:04:32,332 --> 00:04:38,195
Midnighter in the upcoming Authority movie.
Yeah, Deathstroke is an A-tier villain in DC

49
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:42,578
Comics, not only for teams like the Titans,
but also the Justice League. I would love to

50
00:04:42,618 --> 00:04:47,780
see him in action on screen in a way that we
haven't before, like on the small screen with

51
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:54,024
the Titans show or even Arrow. And yeah, Joe
Manganiello was definitely robbed of the opportunity

52
00:04:54,064 --> 00:04:59,671
to play that badass character in a movie. No
one quite has had it as bad, I think, as Joe

53
00:04:59,711 --> 00:05:04,094
Manganiello. So I think he would be great in
the role. I think he deserves to be seen. Yeah,

54
00:05:04,194 --> 00:05:08,437
100%. I also would have hated him as Midnighter,
but I would let him choose what role he wanted

55
00:05:08,457 --> 00:05:11,940
to play. Great answer, Colby Hentges. Let's
go ahead and move on to our next honorable

56
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,724
mention given by Miggy Matangian, who said.
Hey, what's up, guys? This is Miggy, and if

57
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:25,869
I could recast a DCEU actor in the DCU, I would
probably go with Keirsey Clemens as Miss Martian.

58
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:32,511
She played Iris West previously. I think she
just kind of has the vibe to like play an innocent

59
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:38,213
character who's secretly hiding something. I
could also see Jack Dylan Grazer as Beast Boy.

60
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:45,235
Thanks guys. Yeah, those are both great options
for young heroes within DC. I totally get what

61
00:05:45,255 --> 00:05:49,316
you're coming from with Kirsi Clemens. Kind
of having those doe eyes makes her look innocent

62
00:05:49,356 --> 00:05:52,897
and cute like you mentioned. I don't know if
you mentioned the cute part. I added that part.

63
00:05:53,157 --> 00:05:58,399
But yeah, Miss Martian should be cute. Jack
Dylan Grazer as Beast Boy 2 is also a top choice.

64
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,902
I will miss Ryan Potter in the role, but yeah,
Jack Dylan Grazer has all of the qualities

65
00:06:02,922 --> 00:06:08,045
that I think you would want in a Beast Boy actor.
If Keirce Clemens was Ms. Martian, who would

66
00:06:08,085 --> 00:06:14,388
you cast as Marsha Manhunter? Oh, Dennis Haysbert.
Terrific voice, great actor. I think you would

67
00:06:14,428 --> 00:06:18,671
be perfect. That's a good call, that's a good
call. Great answer, Miggy Mathenkean. Our next

68
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:24,466
honorable mention goes to Brandon Estregard,
who said. Hey guys. If I was able to bring

69
00:06:24,506 --> 00:06:30,891
back one actor from the DCU, it would have to
be Eldris Hodge. I would cast him as Icon,

70
00:06:31,211 --> 00:06:37,475
and for bonus I would cast Bailey Bass as Rocket.
Yeah, Eldris Hodge is another great actor that

71
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:42,879
I will definitely miss if he's not brought back
for James Gunn's DCU. I think he would make,

72
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:47,402
like, really any great superhero. I would love
to see him as Icon, because I would love for

73
00:06:47,422 --> 00:06:52,518
there to be an Icon movie. That would be a fantastic
story to put on the screen, for sure. Icons

74
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:56,161
like Superman, but he's different enough where
I think audiences would really latch onto it.

75
00:06:56,621 --> 00:07:01,005
I'm not familiar with Bailey Bass. I guess she
was an avatar, the second one. But yeah, from

76
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:05,508
the looks of it, I think she would be a terrific
Rocket as well. Yeah, we pit Rocket against

77
00:07:05,689 --> 00:07:10,192
Spider-Gwen in a Duel episode. If you guys want
to learn more about Icon and Rocket. But great

78
00:07:10,232 --> 00:07:16,477
answer, Brandon Estregard. The winner of this
week's No Prize goes to Noah Terry, who said,

79
00:07:16,998 --> 00:07:24,355
Hey, guys, so if I could recast any TCU actor
into the DCU, it would be Asher Angel aka Billy

80
00:07:24,395 --> 00:07:31,338
Batson as Nightwing. I think that he can definitely
act with heart. He's no stranger to action

81
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:36,101
and he would just be a great fit to see him
in Batman, the Brave and the Bold. So that's

82
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:42,905
my answer. Thanks, bye guys. Yeah, I cannot
wait to see Nightwing on the big screen. He's

83
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:47,444
a really important character. You know, besides
the Trinity, I think he's probably the fourth

84
00:07:47,484 --> 00:07:52,107
most important character in DC comics. And Asher
Angel definitely has the look for Nightwing.

85
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:56,910
He may be a little young for the character,
but hey, if that's the case, there's always

86
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,213
Red Hood. By the time the movie comes out, he'll
be old enough. Do you think he would do as

87
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:06,337
good of a job as Dick Grayson as Chris O'Donnell
did? Yeah, that's not even a question. I'm

88
00:08:06,597 --> 00:08:11,141
not concerned about that. My big concern is
can he do a better job than Brenton Thwaites

89
00:08:11,201 --> 00:08:16,784
from the Titan series? because Brenton Thwaites
is a phenomenal actor and he did way better

90
00:08:16,804 --> 00:08:21,788
than was even necessary for the character of
Dick Grayson in Nightwing in that show. That's

91
00:08:21,828 --> 00:08:26,571
true, yeah, he would be the guy to beat. He's
by far the best Dick Grayson on screen. Great

92
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:30,214
answer, Noah Terry, you win this week's No Prize.
If you, the listener, want a shot at winning

93
00:08:30,234 --> 00:08:34,717
your own No Prize, stay tuned to later on this
episode when we'll be asking another Question

94
00:08:34,737 --> 00:08:40,841
of the Week. And now that that's done, on to
the news. There is no news. That's right, nevermind.

95
00:08:41,402 --> 00:08:42,750
On to the question of the week.

96
00:08:47,286 --> 00:08:54,713
What Marvel or DC theatrical film are you most
looking forward to in 2025? That of course

97
00:08:54,793 --> 00:09:00,438
includes Superman, which is DC's only theatrical
release this year, Captain America Brave New

98
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:06,644
World, which releases in just about a month,
The Fantastic Four First Steps, or Thunderbolts.

99
00:09:07,185 --> 00:09:13,114
Let us know which one you guys are most pumped
to see in theaters in 2025. Record your answer

Be sure to answer before January 18th.

105
00:09:41,218 --> 00:09:45,685
But I think we're ready now to go ahead and
dive into our duel and find out who would win

106
00:09:45,745 --> 00:09:50,133
in a fight between DC's monitor and Marvel's
watcher.

107
00:10:05,302 --> 00:10:10,443
Alright, the Monitor versus the Watcher. Now,
as I mentioned earlier, we're doing this episode

108
00:10:10,503 --> 00:10:16,625
as a tie-in to the review of What If Season
3, which we spoke about last episode. At the

109
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:23,006
end of that season, the character of the Watcher,
also known as Uwatu, kicks all kinds of ass.

110
00:10:23,287 --> 00:10:27,888
He throws down against the other Watchers, and
it was really a sight to behold. It was a great

111
00:10:27,908 --> 00:10:32,949
way to close out the show, despite the fact
that it kinda goes against the pacifist ideals

112
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:38,484
of the character. So this will be an interesting
duel to get through in pitting two guys who

113
00:10:38,624 --> 00:10:43,067
are basically sworn to inaction against each
other. Yeah, that's more of a watcher thing

114
00:10:43,087 --> 00:10:49,312
than a monitor thing. But yeah, these are essentially
two characters who weren't created to interact

115
00:10:49,352 --> 00:10:53,995
in any way. They were just created to observe.
So in determining how these characters would

116
00:10:54,075 --> 00:10:58,798
fight, we had to get kind of creative. Yeah,
we've gotten creative in a few of our duel

117
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:04,426
episodes before. Like if you listen to the Riddler
versus Arcade, those are two characters. who

118
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:09,127
don't really throw down a lot. You know, they
use their mind in the battle, which is always

119
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:13,568
hard to speculate on. So we ended up coming
up with riddles to give each other to see who

120
00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:19,150
had the strongest mind. In the Mephisto versus
Sandman duel episode, there was a game that

121
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:25,171
was played between Sandman and the devil in
the Sandman comic book series that we decided

122
00:11:25,211 --> 00:11:29,813
to run with for that duel speculation. And that
was a lot of fun. And even if you look at our

123
00:11:29,853 --> 00:11:34,638
most recent duel episode, the one we did at
the end of last year, where we pit dog pool

124
00:11:34,758 --> 00:11:40,081
against ace the bat hound. That was a different
take. We put them against each other in a dog

125
00:11:40,101 --> 00:11:44,124
show because we didn't really wanna see two
dogs tearing each other apart like in an actual

126
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:48,486
dog fight. So we've gotten creative with this
stuff before and I'm really excited to show

127
00:11:48,506 --> 00:11:54,069
you guys how we're going to pit these two observers
against each other and test their observational

128
00:11:54,229 --> 00:11:58,672
skills. Yeah, I'm looking forward to that. I'm
also looking forward to just giving the backstory

129
00:11:58,872 --> 00:12:02,618
of the monitor because giving the backstory
of the monitor. is kind of like giving the

130
00:12:02,658 --> 00:12:08,142
backstory of the DC universe as a whole. So
I kind of feel like this is a special episode.

131
00:12:08,723 --> 00:12:17,350
That's gonna be a really boring story. You could
fuck you, fuck you. To explain our methodology

132
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:22,473
behind our duels, let's go to our sentient Duel
simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ 9K, tell

133
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:27,417
our listeners how you go about determining a
winner in our Duel matchups. Yes, of course,

134
00:12:27,437 --> 00:12:32,227
sir. The way I determine a winner between the
contestants is by running 1000 Monte Carlo

135
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:37,268
simulations using the characters statistics.
A Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic

136
00:12:37,308 --> 00:12:42,850
model used to determine outcomes through random
sampling. In this case, I randomize the statistics

137
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:47,591
along a normal distribution as a way to simulate
the many variables that can occur during battle.

138
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:52,732
The stat parameters are based on the official
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters

139
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:57,942
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat
categories are included such as range, damage

140
00:12:57,962 --> 00:13:03,383
potential, versatility and perception in order
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.

141
00:13:03,863 --> 00:13:08,665
The results of the 1000 simulations provide
a percentage of wins for each character. The

142
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:13,166
contestant with the higher percentage is declared
the victor as they have a higher probability

143
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:19,028
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,
neither character should win 100% of the matches.

144
00:13:19,528 --> 00:13:24,022
The comic book stories have shown that there's
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman. So

145
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:27,923
the confidence rate of my method falls in line
with the precedents that have been established

146
00:13:27,963 --> 00:13:33,504
in the source material. My mathematical simulations
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are

147
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:39,326
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes
tabulated for determination of the winner.

148
00:13:39,346 --> 00:13:43,448
Thanks AJ and NK. Before we run the simulations
though, we like to break down each character's

149
00:13:43,488 --> 00:13:48,389
histories and abilities before improvising a
scenario on how we imagine one of the 1000

150
00:13:48,709 --> 00:13:52,514
simulations would play out. Beat for beat. And
I believe it's my turn to go first with the

151
00:13:52,554 --> 00:13:57,796
Marvel character, so let me go ahead and tell
you guys all about Uwatu the Watcher. The Watchers

152
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:02,637
are one of the most ancient and advanced races
in the Marvel Universe, originating billions

153
00:14:02,657 --> 00:14:07,619
of years ago. Known initially as the Luminous,
they were revered for their vast knowledge

154
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:12,801
and cosmic power, capable of transforming their
bodies into light and traversing the universe

155
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:17,947
in an instant. Their altruistic mission began
with the noble goal of sharing their advanced

156
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:23,172
knowledge to uplift less developed civilizations
and foster universal progress. However, their

157
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:28,836
first attempt to aid the planet Prasilius by
introducing nuclear technology ended in catastrophic

158
00:14:28,896 --> 00:14:34,000
failure. The Prasilikans weaponized the knowledge,
plunging the world into a devastating nuclear

159
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,325
war that annihilated their race. Ashamed and
burdened by guilt, the Luminous took a solemn

160
00:14:39,365 --> 00:14:44,969
vow to observe and record the universe without
interference, renaming themselves the Watchers.

161
00:14:45,578 --> 00:14:49,921
Relocating to various parts of the cosmos, they
built an extraordinary repository of knowledge

162
00:14:49,981 --> 00:14:55,265
called the Acycopedia Universum, and established
their sacred code of non-interference. Over

163
00:14:55,306 --> 00:15:00,330
millennia, they became cosmic chroniclers, silently
witnessing the unfolding history of the universe,

164
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:06,214
preserving its secrets, and standing as eternal
guardians of knowledge. The lessons from Priscilla

165
00:15:06,234 --> 00:15:11,279
Kiss forever shaped their philosophy, instilling
a deep-seated fear of unintended consequences

166
00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:17,524
and their cosmic responsibilities. Among the
Watchers, Uatu was uniquely drawn to the complexity

167
00:15:17,564 --> 00:15:22,508
and resilience of Earth and its solar system.
Establishing his base in the blue area of the

168
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:28,553
moon, Uatu faithfully upheld his duties for
millennia. His father, Ikor, was a staunch

169
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:34,097
advocate of the Watcher's Code, shaping Uatu's
early understanding of their mission and instilling

170
00:15:34,157 --> 00:15:40,242
in him a deep sense of responsibility. Despite
his upbringing, Uatu developed a profound fascination

171
00:15:40,262 --> 00:15:46,162
with humanity and its capacity for both greatness
and destruction. The unique Duelity of human

172
00:15:46,202 --> 00:15:51,925
nature with its boundless potential deeply resonated
with Uatu, fostering a strong emotional connection

173
00:15:51,945 --> 00:15:56,747
with Earth's inhabitants. Uatu's first recorded
interaction with humanity occurred in 1602,

174
00:15:58,387 --> 00:16:03,009
when a temporarily displaced Captain America
threatened to unravel the time stream. Uatu

175
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:07,951
revealed himself to an Elizabethan-era Doctor
Strange who was instrumental in facilitating

176
00:16:07,991 --> 00:16:12,853
Captain America's return to his rightful time,
thus preserving the integrity of the timeline.

177
00:16:13,302 --> 00:16:18,725
This event marked the beginning of a long history
of subtle interventions that would define Uatu's

178
00:16:18,765 --> 00:16:24,049
role as Earth's watcher. In modern times, Uatu's
fascination with humanity deepened when the

179
00:16:24,069 --> 00:16:29,533
Fantastic Four ventured to the moon and discovered
his citadel. You can learn more about the Fantastic

180
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:34,776
Four in their duel against the Justice Society.
Uatu observed the Fantastic Four's battle against

181
00:16:34,796 --> 00:16:39,920
the Russian scientist known as the Red Ghost
and his Super Apes, a conflict he allowed to

182
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:45,070
play out as a test of their mettle and unity.
Impressed by the Fantastic Four's victory,

183
00:16:45,491 --> 00:16:50,873
Uatu began to subtly intervene in critical events
on Earth, justifying his actions as necessary

184
00:16:50,913 --> 00:16:55,935
to safeguard the planet from existential threats.
His involvement with the Fantastic Four established

185
00:16:55,975 --> 00:17:00,997
a precedent for future interactions with Earth's
heroes, further intertwining his destiny with

186
00:17:01,037 --> 00:17:06,639
theirs. Among Uatu's most significant violations
of the Watcher's Code was his involvement in

187
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:12,578
humanity's first encounter with Galactus, the
world's devouring cosmic entity. Using his

188
00:17:12,618 --> 00:17:17,939
advanced technology, Uatu attempted to cloak
Earth from Galactus' detection, and later guided

189
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:23,521
the Human Torch to Galactus' worldship to retrieve
the Ultimate Nullifier, the only weapon capable

190
00:17:23,561 --> 00:17:28,062
of deterring the World's Devourer. You can learn
more about Galactus in his duel against the

191
00:17:28,102 --> 00:17:33,384
Spectre. Though Galactus ultimately spared Earth,
Uatu's actions drew the attention of his fellow

192
00:17:33,424 --> 00:17:38,545
Watchers, leading to a trial that found him
guilty of repeated interference. Despite their

193
00:17:38,585 --> 00:17:43,709
disapproval, Uatu's love for humanity compelled
him to continue observing Earth and its heroes

194
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:49,152
closely, often justifying his defiance by the
planet's unique potential and his belief that

195
00:17:49,232 --> 00:17:53,876
Earth held a special place in the cosmos. Over
the following years, Uatu played a pivotal

196
00:17:53,936 --> 00:17:58,419
role in more events. He warned the Fantastic
Four of threats like the Molecule Man and the

197
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:03,362
Overmind, assisted the Avengers in battles against
time-traveling foes such as King the Conqueror,

198
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:09,174
and provided invaluable guidance during crises
like the Kreisgrul War. Yet Uatu's compassion

199
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:13,857
extended beyond humanity. He offered aid to
extraterrestrial allies like the Silver Surfer,

200
00:18:14,297 --> 00:18:18,960
and intervened in cosmic disputes that threatened
the stability of the universe. His penchant

201
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:24,283
for continuing to bend the rules led to increased
conflict with other Watchers, including his

202
00:18:24,343 --> 00:18:30,026
nephew, Eren. As a young Watcher who had not
yet been assigned a station, Eren also broke

203
00:18:30,046 --> 00:18:34,269
the Watcher's code and schemed to manipulate
the Fantastic Four to create a pocket universe

204
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:39,879
that he could rule on his own. Uatu ultimately
subdued Eren, an act that sacrificed his own

205
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:44,501
status among the Watchers, as they stripped
him of his title and exiled him from their

206
00:18:44,621 --> 00:18:50,804
order. Despite his exile, Uatu's bond with Earth
remained unbroken. He continued to witness

207
00:18:50,844 --> 00:18:56,226
humanity's triumphs and tragedies. However,
Uatu's history took a tragic turn as a citadel

208
00:18:56,306 --> 00:19:00,988
on the moon was attacked by a group of villains
who sought to plunder his vast repository of

209
00:19:01,048 --> 00:19:06,670
knowledge. Uatu was gravely wounded and one
of his eyes… containing the secrets of everything

210
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:12,372
he had observed was stolen. Nick Fury, senior,
seeking to prevent further misuse of the Watcher's

211
00:19:12,392 --> 00:19:18,174
knowledge, confronted the injured Uatu, who
after being attacked had now become more steadfast

212
00:19:18,474 --> 00:19:24,496
in his code of non-interference. When Uatu refused
to divulge his attackers identities, Fury took

213
00:19:24,516 --> 00:19:29,317
the drastic step of killing him with a gamma
irradiated bullet and taking his remaining

214
00:19:29,517 --> 00:19:35,136
eye. This granted Nick Fury all of Uatu's knowledge,
and he reluctantly inherited his role as Earth's

215
00:19:35,196 --> 00:19:40,879
observer, now known as the Unseen. You can learn
more about Nick Fury Sr. in his son's duel

216
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:47,262
against Rick Flag. However, Uatu was later miraculously
resurrected from his own eye when the Unseen

217
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:52,865
happened upon some ancient alien relics. Uatu
reclaimed his role as the Watcher and employed

218
00:19:52,945 --> 00:19:58,131
the now- powerless Nick Fury to act as his agent
against a newly discovered renegade faction

219
00:19:58,331 --> 00:20:03,133
of Priscilla Kins, the same race believed to
have destroyed themselves all those eons ago.

220
00:20:03,594 --> 00:20:09,516
As they were now waging a war against the Watchers,
Uatu traveled to his home planet of T-37X to

221
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:14,318
call the other Watchers to action. Yet they
still vowed not to interfere so as not to repeat

222
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:19,000
the mistakes of their past, and the Watchers
imprisoned Uatu. Using a device called the

223
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:25,163
Apex of All Realities, which could see what-if
worlds, they made Uatu watch an alternate reality

224
00:20:25,263 --> 00:20:30,406
in which he had not helped the Fantastic Four
against Galactus. He saw that not only would

225
00:20:30,506 --> 00:20:34,708
Earth have repelled the World Devourer on its
own, but the planet would have developed into

226
00:20:34,748 --> 00:20:40,711
a scientific utopia. Distraught, Uatu was soon
rescued by Nick Fury, and he later learned

227
00:20:40,771 --> 00:20:45,914
that alternate Earth would have eventually been
destroyed by its own technology. As the Priscilla

228
00:20:45,934 --> 00:20:47,415
Kins poisoned the Watcher's

229
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:58,524
who merged with the apex of all realities to
become the one and only Watcher. He used his

230
00:20:58,604 --> 00:21:03,666
increased power to restore the Priscilla's home,
and reinstated Nick Fury Senior as Earth's

231
00:21:03,746 --> 00:21:09,269
new Watcher. And that's his backstory. Powers-wise,
the Watcher, like every member of his race,

232
00:21:09,349 --> 00:21:14,751
is considered a cosmic-level being with vast
power and knowledge. Though he's sworn to inaction,

233
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:19,313
he will occasionally take the minimal steps
necessary to prevent large-scale death and

234
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:25,643
destruction. Among his vast power set is omniscient
level cosmic awareness and senses, immortality,

235
00:21:26,143 --> 00:21:33,125
telepathy on a global scale, teleportation on
a universal scale, invisibility, illusion casting,

236
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:40,847
time travel, flight, vast durability, size alteration,
vast cosmic energies that can create blasts

237
00:21:40,907 --> 00:21:46,108
on a global scale or shields or other constructs.
He also has an extra-dimensional portal that

238
00:21:46,129 --> 00:21:53,156
he can use to see into alternate realities.
He is all-knowing, he's all-powerful, and today

239
00:21:53,176 --> 00:21:58,141
he's gonna kick all kinds of monitor ass. Bro,
the Watcher is like monitor light. What are

240
00:21:58,161 --> 00:22:03,646
you talking about? If by monitor light you mean
gonna totally stomp all over monitor's ass,

241
00:22:03,686 --> 00:22:10,171
then yeah. No, you don't know what light means,
apparently. You'll get what I'm talking about

242
00:22:10,231 --> 00:22:12,333
when I go over the monitor's backstory.

243
00:22:17,258 --> 00:22:23,779
was one of three cosmic siblings created by
Perpetua, a celestial being known as a Hand

244
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:29,161
that hailed from the greater omniverse. The
Hands were tasked with creating multiverses

245
00:22:29,421 --> 00:22:35,643
within the omniverse using anti-crisis energy
from the source, God essentially, intended

246
00:22:35,723 --> 00:22:42,985
to pass their energies back to him upon completion.
Perpetua, however, defied her purpose, forging

247
00:22:43,085 --> 00:22:49,766
a multiverse fueled by negative crisis energy.
the DC Multiverse, designed to perpetuate itself

248
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:55,548
through cycles of crises and rebirth that would
keep her alive. Perpetua shaped her multiverse

249
00:22:55,588 --> 00:23:01,990
into three distinct realms, dark matter of creative
potential, positive matter of constancy and

250
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:09,312
order, and destructive antimatter. To oversee
these realms, she created her three sons. Marnovu,

251
00:23:09,452 --> 00:23:14,490
the Monitor, was charged with safeguarding the
positive matter realm. and preserving the universes

252
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:20,194
within it from existential threats. Alpheus,
the World Forger, crafted potential universes

253
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:26,497
within the Dark Matter Realm. Mobius, the Anti-Monitor,
governed the Anti-Matter Realm, tasked with

254
00:23:26,557 --> 00:23:31,700
ensuring the light of creation did not breach
the boundaries of the Greater Omniverse and

255
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:37,784
alert the Source. Curious about the Greater
Omniverse, Marnovu peered into it and its other

256
00:23:37,844 --> 00:23:44,258
multiverses, becoming aware of his mother's
crime. When he confronted Perpetua, she revealed

257
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:50,380
her intent to remain as their multiverse's eternal
protector and shared her vision of omniversal

258
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:56,442
conquest. To achieve this, she merged Martians
and humans to create an army of perfect and

259
00:23:56,482 --> 00:24:03,143
immortal beings known as Apex Predators, genetically
designed for endless warfare. Horrified and

260
00:24:03,183 --> 00:24:08,825
fearing the judgment of the source, Marnovu
rejected his mother, who unleashed her Apex

261
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:15,880
Predators on him. Marnovu eventually united
with Alpheus and Mobius to oppose their mother.

262
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:21,984
In their Promethean galaxy, they created a colossal
tuning fork tower in an attempt to communicate

263
00:24:22,004 --> 00:24:27,447
with the Omniverse to expose Perpetua's crimes,
and though she attempted to intervene by unleashing

264
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:33,810
her army on them, her sons were successful.
The source responded by sending a cosmic raptor,

265
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:42,355
a manifestation of judgment, to confront Perpetua.
Perpetua and all of her power were imprisoned

266
00:24:42,395 --> 00:24:49,018
within a source wall made up of her apex predators,
a boundary that marked the multiverse's edge.

267
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:55,562
Rather than destroy Perpetua's creation, the
multiverse was reset, including the three brothers,

268
00:24:55,882 --> 00:25:02,206
with Marnovu coalescing over time on the moon
of Oa in the Prime Universe and Mobius on the

269
00:25:02,246 --> 00:25:04,867
moon of Chord in the Antimatter Universe.

270
00:25:09,738 --> 00:25:14,400
sought to destroy him, beginning by conquering
the antimatter universe and subjugating the

271
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:20,023
citizenry of Kord into becoming his army. He
transferred the most loyal of Kord's inhabitants

272
00:25:20,363 --> 00:25:25,566
into shadow demons and corporeal extensions
of his will, while drafting others into his

273
00:25:25,706 --> 00:25:31,990
army of Thundererers, warriors equipped with
devastating lightning bolts. Marnovu, aware

274
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:36,973
of his brother's actions, eventually went to
war with Mobius in a universal battle between

275
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:42,187
the barrier of their universes. that spanned
a million years. Their feud eventually ended

276
00:25:42,267 --> 00:25:47,869
in a stalemate, leaving both the monitor and
the anti-monitor inert and trapped in a state

277
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:54,152
of dormancy. For nine billion years, they remained
motionless, forgotten by the countless worlds

278
00:25:54,192 --> 00:25:59,674
their battle had once threatened. Eventually,
Krona, a curious scientist from the planet

279
00:25:59,714 --> 00:26:05,817
Maltus, sought to know the origins of the universe,
and in his experimentations, fractured the

280
00:26:05,877 --> 00:26:12,455
newly stabilized multiverse into infinite parallel
universes. Though Corona mistakenly believed

281
00:26:12,555 --> 00:26:18,877
he had created the multiverse, his actions merely
revealed its existence to his reality, destabilizing

282
00:26:18,937 --> 00:26:24,878
it further. The Malthusians suppressed the story
of Perpetua, fearing the consequences of her

283
00:26:24,938 --> 00:26:31,980
legacy. Pariah, a scientist from a fringe universe
like Corona, unintentionally discovered the

284
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:38,222
anti-matter universe, accidentally unleashing
it into his own and destroying it. This act

285
00:26:38,422 --> 00:26:44,307
also awakened Mobius, as the antimatter universe
expanded to fill the void of the one Pariah

286
00:26:44,347 --> 00:26:51,013
destroyed, increasing Mobius' domain and power.
Re-amassing his army and sending universe-destroying

287
00:26:51,053 --> 00:26:56,757
waves of antimatter into the multiverse, Mobius
determined that to defeat Marnovu, he could

288
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:03,543
gain infinite power by destroying the now infinite
multiverse. Sensing Mobius' resurgence, Marnovu

289
00:27:03,683 --> 00:27:09,575
also awoke and prepared for the coming crisis.
Establishing a base in space, he used advanced

290
00:27:09,655 --> 00:27:15,637
technology to study the multiverse and identify
champions capable of defending it. Among these

291
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:21,860
was Harbinger, a girl he rescued and empowered
to serve as his emissary. As Mobius's antimatter

292
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:28,083
wave began consuming universes, Marnovu devised
a plan to preserve what remained. He constructed

293
00:27:28,143 --> 00:27:34,085
colossal tuning fork towers to stabilize surviving
Earths, which were at the centers of each universe.

294
00:27:34,602 --> 00:27:40,967
tasked his champions with defending these devices.
Harbinger was sent to retrieve the infant Alexander

295
00:27:41,027 --> 00:27:46,812
Luther Jr, the last survivor of Earth-3, whose
parents sent him in a rocket ship to Earth-1

296
00:27:47,352 --> 00:27:53,357
during an antimatter wave, turning him into
a being made of both positive and antimatter.

297
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:58,722
Mobius, however, subtly corrupted Harbinger
by possessing her multiversal counterparts

298
00:27:58,742 --> 00:28:04,766
with shadow demons, and successfully tricked
her into killing the monitor. Marnovu foresaw

299
00:28:04,786 --> 00:28:10,290
her betrayal, however, and used his death to
power the Tuning Forks, merging Earth-1 and

300
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:16,695
Earth-2 into a netherverse shielded from Mobius.
The sacrifice allowed the defenders of the

301
00:28:16,755 --> 00:28:22,499
multiverse to regroup and ultimately defeat
Mobius, the Anti-Monitor, collapsing the infinite

302
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:28,364
multiverse into a single, unified reality known
as New Earth. Although New Earth streamlined

303
00:28:28,404 --> 00:28:34,387
the multiverse into a cohesive timeline, traces
and memories of their original multiverse lingered.

304
00:28:34,787 --> 00:28:39,829
The re-emergence of the multiverse began during
another crisis event caused by Alexander Luther

305
00:28:39,869 --> 00:28:46,312
Jr., who believed the New Earth was flawed.
Using the remains of Mobius's armor, he constructed

306
00:28:46,372 --> 00:28:52,515
a tuning fork tower to split New Earth into
multiple universes in an effort to find a perfect

307
00:28:52,695 --> 00:28:58,542
one. His actions, though ultimately thwarted,
destabilized reality. and led to the creation

308
00:28:58,622 --> 00:29:04,607
of a finite multiverse of 52 parallel Earths.
This restructured multiverse gave rise to a

309
00:29:04,707 --> 00:29:10,491
new race of monitors, fragments of Marnovu's
essence, each overseeing a specific Earth.

310
00:29:10,851 --> 00:29:16,735
Unlike Marnovu, these monitors were not unified
by a singular purpose. They developed indiviDuel

311
00:29:16,775 --> 00:29:23,300
personalities and often clashed over their roles.
Bob, the monitor of New Earth, championed empathy

312
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,875
and collaboration between the universes. In
contrast, Solomon, the monitor of Earth-8,

313
00:29:29,655 --> 00:29:35,518
pursued the violent eradication of multiversal
anomalies, or people who existed outside their

314
00:29:35,558 --> 00:29:41,520
intended universe. Solomon's genocidal stance
divided the monitors and led to internal strife

315
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:46,502
within their order and without, creating enemies
against their kind that included the being

316
00:29:46,582 --> 00:29:52,145
known as Monarch, who forced superpowered beings
across the multiverse into gladiatorial matches

317
00:29:52,185 --> 00:29:56,287
to determine the strongest among them. for an
army that he was building to eliminate the

318
00:29:56,347 --> 00:30:01,970
Monitors. The conflict escalated when Solomon
attempted to absorb Bob's essence to augment

319
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:07,334
his own power, resulting in Bob's death and
destabilizing the Monitor Collective. Amid

320
00:30:07,394 --> 00:30:14,418
this chaos, Monarch's actions led to the destruction
of Earth 51, whose Monitor, Nyx Uotan, was

321
00:30:14,478 --> 00:30:19,978
banished to Prime Earth for failing to protect
his universe. Stripped of his powers, He lived

322
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:25,142
as a human until regaining his memories and
becoming a superhero known as Super Judge.

323
00:30:25,442 --> 00:30:31,027
During the supposed final crisis event, Nix
became one of the last surviving Monitors,

324
00:30:31,387 --> 00:30:36,671
assembling an army of supermen from across the
multiverse to defeat Mandrake, a corrupted

325
00:30:36,812 --> 00:30:42,476
Monitor. Despite their victory, Nix lamented
the Monitor's failures and allowed their civilization

326
00:30:42,556 --> 00:30:49,302
to fade. In post-Flashpoint continuity, unbeknownst
to the resurrected Marnovu and Mobius, Their

327
00:30:49,342 --> 00:30:55,563
brother Alpheus had been killed by his pet dragon
Barbados, who had been responsible for devouring

328
00:30:55,703 --> 00:31:02,565
newly forged universes too dark to exist. Barbados'
abandonment of his duty led to the formation

329
00:31:02,645 --> 00:31:08,827
of the Dark Multiverse, champions from which
were led by Barbados in a war against the Multiverse.

330
00:31:09,287 --> 00:31:14,369
Though Barbados and his army were defeated,
the war eventually resulted in a crack within

331
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:21,424
the source wall that freed Perpetua. sought
to reclaim her multiverse. Marnovu, Mobius,

332
00:31:21,584 --> 00:31:28,087
and a newly reformed Alphius merged to form
the Ultra Monitor in a desperate bid to stop

333
00:31:28,107 --> 00:31:33,490
their mother, but Perpetua regained her strength,
turning Mobius against her brothers by granting

334
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:38,393
him the anti-life equation that allowed him
to control his brothers. With help from the

335
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:42,715
Green Lantern John Stewart, who you can learn
more about in our Green Lantern vs Quasar duel

336
00:31:42,755 --> 00:31:49,451
episode, Marnovu and Alphius were freed from
their and Alpheus sacrificed his life to protect

337
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:55,535
Marnovu and his allies from a universe destroying
attack from Perpetua. To help stop his mother,

338
00:31:55,895 --> 00:32:02,000
Marnovu hid shards of Element X, the metal used
to forge universes, for the forces opposing

339
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:07,183
his mother to find when Perpetua and the Batman
Who Laughs took over reality. You can learn

340
00:32:07,203 --> 00:32:11,786
more about the Batman Who Laughs and his duel
against Cosmic Ghost Rider. This helped Wonder

341
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:17,930
Woman defeat both, after which the hands of
the Multiverse recreated. DC's multiverse.

342
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:24,833
And that's his history so far. Power-wise, the
Monitor Marnovu wields immense cosmic power,

343
00:32:25,173 --> 00:32:30,095
including multiversal cosmic awareness that
enables him to perceive and understand the

344
00:32:30,195 --> 00:32:35,678
infinite dimensions and realities that comprise
the multiverse. His abilities include matter

345
00:32:35,838 --> 00:32:41,940
and energy manipulation, teleportation across
universes, and control over space-time itself.

346
00:32:42,201 --> 00:32:46,566
He wields the dimensional superstructure of
the universe. one of seven forces of the universe,

347
00:32:46,926 --> 00:32:51,468
granting him partial control over the fabric
of reality, though his power is diminished

348
00:32:51,568 --> 00:32:57,531
outside of the sixth dimension. While he's immortal,
he can be destroyed, though he'll reform within

349
00:32:57,551 --> 00:33:03,333
the sixth dimension. His size can shift from
human scale to planetary proportions, and his

350
00:33:03,413 --> 00:33:09,096
precognition provides glimpses into possible
futures. His one weakness is that his strength

351
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:14,654
and power is intrinsically tied to the stability
of his domain. should the universes of the

352
00:33:14,694 --> 00:33:20,116
multiverse be destroyed, his power would diminish.
Well, it's too bad for him that Uatu is gonna

353
00:33:20,156 --> 00:33:24,318
basically destroy all of his multiverse and
then just leave him powerless. That doesn't

354
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:29,441
sound like something Uatu would do. You know
what Uatu would do? He would fucking fall asleep

355
00:33:29,681 --> 00:33:35,083
while listening to that story because it was
so long and so convoluted and boring. No, yeah,

356
00:33:35,123 --> 00:33:41,494
that was way better than Uatu's history, I'm
sorry. Way better. Way more epic. What is going

357
00:33:41,514 --> 00:33:47,476
to pull a harbinger and kill monitors ass just
like she did? You forget that the monitor gave

358
00:33:47,596 --> 00:33:53,918
Harbinger a shit ton of power. So now, bro,
what an idiot. What an idiot. Well, monitor

359
00:33:53,938 --> 00:33:58,019
is going to pull a Nick Fury and just shoot
the watcher with a fucking bullet. Hey, that

360
00:33:58,059 --> 00:34:03,061
was before he was the one and only watcher.
So, OK, well, Harbinger killed monitor before

361
00:34:03,101 --> 00:34:05,941
he was the ultra monitor. I don't know.

362

where fantasies collide and heroes clash, one
podcast network rises above the rest. Prepare

where we settle the debate and settle the score.

369
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:04,059
Now that we got the histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

370
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:09,521
of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not our speculation,

371
00:35:09,882 --> 00:35:13,803
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could
play out. AJ and IK, what are the rules of

372
00:35:13,823 --> 00:35:18,786
our speculation? Well I should say there are
no rules, other than the characters have no

373
00:35:18,846 --> 00:35:23,408
prior knowledge of the other going into the
fight. All they are aware of starting out is

374
00:35:23,448 --> 00:35:28,038
that the other character is a threat that needs
to be eliminated. For the speculation... The

375
00:35:28,058 --> 00:35:33,121
contestants will begin approximately 50 meters
apart in a nondescript environment that will

376
00:35:33,141 --> 00:35:38,465
have no bearing on the match itself, as no environmental
statistics are considered in my simulations.

377
00:35:38,765 --> 00:35:44,049
The contestants must earn victory on their own
merit. Alright then, let's get into it. Monitor

378
00:35:44,169 --> 00:35:49,593
and Watcher meet on the battlefield. Who goes
first? Well, since neither of these cosmic

379
00:35:49,633 --> 00:35:53,595
level beings are really known for fighting,
we thought we would take a different route

380
00:35:53,615 --> 00:35:58,583
with this duel by challenging each other on
what they're known for. observing. To that

381
00:35:58,683 --> 00:36:03,666
end, the Monitor and the Watcher have come to
the match prepared with certain events from

382
00:36:03,766 --> 00:36:09,610
DC and Marvel's history in order to test their
opponents' observational skills. It's a contest

383
00:36:09,751 --> 00:36:15,475
of watching, essentially, or since this is a
podcast, listening. Yeah, how good is the other

384
00:36:15,495 --> 00:36:20,818
character at perceiving the events of their
respective universes? In a way, we could all

385
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:26,703
be considered Watchers and Monitors of Marvel
and DC as consumers. of Marvel and DC films

386
00:36:26,743 --> 00:36:31,666
and shows, and that we observe what happens
without taking action and chronicling their

387
00:36:31,706 --> 00:36:39,451
events in our fanboy minds. Right, so Jonathan,
as the DC monitor, will be presented with four

388
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:45,896
audio events from DC's past, same for me as
the Marvel Watcher. The task will be to identify

389
00:36:45,936 --> 00:36:50,479
the four events given to us, and the one who
correctly identifies more events will be the

390
00:36:50,539 --> 00:36:55,499
winner of this speculation. And to add a twist
to the challenge, Each event presented to the

391
00:36:55,539 --> 00:37:00,243
opposing character will have some sort of commonality,
be it a thematic throughline or some other

392
00:37:00,283 --> 00:37:05,747
connection. Both the Watchers and the Monitor's
ultimate test will be to deduce this commonality

393
00:37:05,827 --> 00:37:11,151
in order to win. So let's get started. The Watcher
presents the Monitor with an event from the

394
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:18,657
DC Universe. Okay DC Monitor, here is your first
event. This city is mine.

395
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:53,175
Okay, I have no idea whose voice that is. The
city is mine. So a city is involved. It sounds

396
00:37:53,275 --> 00:37:58,660
after that there's like a dragon like screaming
and it's just like attacking all these people

397
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:05,565
and destroying some kind of city, I'm assuming.
But at the very end, there's like this robotic

398
00:38:05,906 --> 00:38:11,490
cybernetic kind of sound. It can't be cyborg.
This is not Justice League. There's some kind

399
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:17,679
of giant monster there. Shazam Fury of the Gods
had a dragon. Aquaman had a giant carathen.

400
00:38:17,819 --> 00:38:23,002
The Suicide Squad had Starro. Oh, is that the
thinker who's saying the city is mine? You

401
00:38:23,042 --> 00:38:27,604
can't just name every movie and every monster.
Okay. I think I know what scene this is. Okay

402
00:38:27,624 --> 00:38:35,248
this is the climactic battle of the Suicide
Squad when Starro is confronting the Suicide

403
00:38:35,288 --> 00:38:41,032
Squad telling them that the city belongs to
him and all of his minions that have Starro's

404
00:38:41,092 --> 00:38:47,576
on their faces begin to attack the Suicide Squad.
That is correct. Yes. Oh, good gosh. This is

405
00:38:47,636 --> 00:38:53,481
the Star of the Conqueror scene from the Suicide
Squad when Star of the Conqueror attacks Corto

406
00:38:53,501 --> 00:38:59,225
Maltese. And the computerized sounds that you
hear at the end are Amanda Waller's crew waking

407
00:38:59,306 --> 00:39:04,850
up to find out that there's a freaking Kaiju
that's been awakened. Gotcha. Okay. So one

408
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:10,194
point for me, apparently. Yes, one point for
you. Okay. So now it's the monitor's turn to

409
00:39:10,254 --> 00:39:13,837
present the Watcher with an event from Marvel.

410
00:39:44,054 --> 00:39:51,259
This one is Easy Money. I hear a man saying
no, and I hear cityscape sounds, and also a

411
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:59,025
very distinctive scoring, music-wise. The event
in question is when Otto Octavius realizes

412
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:03,548
that the metal arms have been grafted to his
body, and he escapes out into the city and

413
00:40:03,608 --> 00:40:09,193
attacks a taxi cab before fleeing into the night.
Right, what movie is that from? That is from

414
00:40:09,453 --> 00:40:16,022
Spider-Man 2. Great job, you had a way easier
time with that one than I did. Well, I'm just

415
00:40:16,062 --> 00:40:22,328
a better observer, I guess. But now it is the
DC Monitor's turn again. Here is your next

416
00:40:22,368 --> 00:40:22,648
event.

417
00:40:26,146 --> 00:40:30,350
Come on, start moving now people, let's go!
The boss wants us out of the building, so let's

418
00:40:30,391 --> 00:40:31,552
make it happen! Jack!

419
00:40:52,758 --> 00:41:00,562
Okay, I'm hearing a car chase, it sounds like.
And there's a lot of destruction and structures

420
00:41:00,602 --> 00:41:05,564
crumbling. Two guys are talking. It definitely
sounds like Ben Affleck. Sounds like there's

421
00:41:05,584 --> 00:41:11,848
a lot of chaos and destruction going on and
someone's driving. This has to be the opening

422
00:41:11,988 --> 00:41:19,292
to Batman v Superman when Bruce Wayne is racing
to Wayne Enterprises during Zod's attack on

423
00:41:19,652 --> 00:41:25,906
Metropolis. That is correct. from Batman vs
Superman, a point to the DC monitor for that

424
00:41:25,986 --> 00:41:31,854
one. Two for two. Gotta say, Hans Zimmer's score
during that film, still really iconic. Moving

425
00:41:32,014 --> 00:41:37,661
on to the second challenge for Uwatu. Here is
the second event for Marvel.

426
00:41:45,454 --> 00:41:51,962
Are you even pulling? Are you on my team? Just
represent, pull! Alright, let's go! NNNN

427
00:42:00,102 --> 00:42:01,125
Good Steve, no pressure.

428
00:42:04,706 --> 00:42:11,775
Come on, Cap. Okay, I'm hearing a lot of voices.
I'm hearing people struggling. I'm hearing

429
00:42:11,815 --> 00:42:16,697
some whimsical music. This is another pretty
easy one, I think. This is the scene when the

430
00:42:16,777 --> 00:42:23,239
Avengers try to lift Thor's hammer from Avengers
Age of Ultron. That is correct. One more point

431
00:42:23,299 --> 00:42:29,521
for the Watcher. Congrats. All right, it is
now the DC Monitor's turn for the next event.

432
00:42:59,562 --> 00:43:03,885
Okay, that's definitely from a Superman movie.
I think it's from Superman the movie. Is this

433
00:43:03,945 --> 00:43:08,949
the destruction of Krypton? That is correct.
Yes, this is the destruction of Krypton from

434
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:12,132
Superman the movie. Yeah, this is the scene
where we see all of the Kryptonians sort of

435
00:43:12,232 --> 00:43:18,538
falling into the fiery chasms that are now what's
left of Krypton. And after the planet explodes,

436
00:43:18,578 --> 00:43:24,963
we see the baby hell else ship zip by the camera.
Correct. Yeah, good job. All right. The DC

437
00:43:24,983 --> 00:43:29,646
monitor gets another point. You're three for
three so far. I freaking got scared at the

438
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:36,871
beginning of the clip, I'm not gonna lie. Alright,
the monitor is now presenting Uatu with Marvel's

439
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:40,313
third event to recall. I shall miss you, my
friend.

440
00:44:08,866 --> 00:44:15,167
What the fuck is that from? Okay, I hear what
sounds like Professor X saying, I will miss

441
00:44:15,227 --> 00:44:20,929
you, my friend. And then a lot of people saying,
I'm sorry. Ooh, this is a tough one. I don't

442
00:44:21,009 --> 00:44:27,090
immediately recognize what this is from. Maybe
I'm not correct and that's not Professor X.

443
00:44:27,731 --> 00:44:34,532
Oh, I know what this is from. Okay, the I'm
sorry suddenly makes sense now. This is from

444
00:44:34,592 --> 00:44:41,823
Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness
when Black Bolt erases Doctor Strange from

445
00:44:42,223 --> 00:44:48,265
that timeline. Right, a multiversal Doctor Strange
from the multiverse, where Professor X and

446
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:52,967
Black Bolt and Mr. Fantastic are all part of
this council. That was a great challenge right

447
00:44:52,987 --> 00:44:57,489
there. I'm ashamed to say that I didn't immediately
get it because I'm sure some of our listeners

448
00:44:57,549 --> 00:45:03,131
will, but I'm glad I pulled it off in the end.
That's three points for me so far. For you,

449
00:45:03,251 --> 00:45:10,989
the DC Monitor, I present you with your final
challenge. The only way to save the world from

450
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:13,241
ever happening. Take this.

451
00:45:36,742 --> 00:45:43,605
Okay, I'm pretty sure this has to be from the
flash just because someone's telling another

452
00:45:43,645 --> 00:45:48,667
guy to run and there's like this electrical
sound. I can't pinpoint the scene though. I'm

453
00:45:48,707 --> 00:45:53,709
not sure who's telling him to run, I think.
I want to know what the guy gives the runner

454
00:45:54,110 --> 00:45:59,092
when he says take this. What is that? Obviously,
this has to be from a film where something

455
00:45:59,152 --> 00:46:04,062
just catastrophic happens and time has to be
rewritten. That's why my guess is it's the

456
00:46:04,102 --> 00:46:08,523
Flash, but it could also be Zack Snyder's Justice
League. Why can't I recognize that voice? That

457
00:46:08,943 --> 00:46:14,145
frigging kills me. I feel like this is from
an animated film. Is this from Justice League

458
00:46:14,185 --> 00:46:20,186
Dark Apocalypse War? It is not. No. Okay, well
then it's gotta be from the Tomorrowverse.

459
00:46:20,686 --> 00:46:26,308
This has gotta be from Justice League Crisis
on Infinite Earths, part one. I'm guessing.

460
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,388
Fuck you.

461
00:46:30,569 --> 00:46:35,547
I feel like I could see the scene in my head.
I just have no idea what movie it's from or

462
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:43,070
who's on the screen. It's just shadows really.
The voice belongs to Thomas Wayne and it is

463
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:49,272
from the end of Justice League the Flashpoint
Paradox. When he says take this he's handing

464
00:46:49,512 --> 00:46:54,034
Barry Allen a note to his son Bruce Wayne. You
know I should have known this I feel really

465
00:46:54,094 --> 00:46:59,336
stupid because of course that's what it's from.
For that particular round I award you no points

466
00:46:59,896 --> 00:47:05,960
and may God have mercy on your soul Jonathan.
I need that. Well, that's three out of four

467
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,603
for the monitor. Let's see how Marvel's The
Watcher fares with this fourth and final event

468
00:47:13,024 --> 00:47:14,885
that I'm hoping is the most difficult.

469
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:51,675
Okay, I hear animals attacking each other. I
hear a dog getting slapped. And I think there's

470
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:59,001
really only one movie that happens in, and that
would be the Hulk dog fight from the 2003 movie

471
00:47:59,061 --> 00:48:04,545
Hulk. You think you're better than me? I think
I'm a better Watcher than you, yeah. Okay.

472
00:48:06,387 --> 00:48:13,012
Well, maybe not. Let's see if you pass the ultimate
test, Mr. Watcher. What do all four of these

473
00:48:13,152 --> 00:48:18,767
events have in common? Well, why don't you tell
me first? There was the climactic battle against

474
00:48:18,807 --> 00:48:23,989
Starro at the end of the Suicide Squad. There
was the opening to Batman v Superman with Bruce

475
00:48:24,009 --> 00:48:29,412
Wayne driving to Wayne Enterprises during Zod's
attack. So I guess cities are being destroyed.

476
00:48:29,932 --> 00:48:35,134
There was Superman the movie with the destruction
of Krypton. And then I guess there was the

477
00:48:35,154 --> 00:48:42,137
destruction of an entire universe in the Flashpoint
Paradox. So the theme is destruction? That

478
00:48:42,177 --> 00:48:48,675
is correct. Yeah. cosmic level events of mass
destruction. Yeah. Gotcha. Okay, cool. So I

479
00:48:48,715 --> 00:48:55,377
guess I win ultimately. Even though I got one
wrong. For the Watcher, the events that were

480
00:48:55,397 --> 00:49:03,499
presented to him were Doctor Octopus's awakening,
you have the Avengers trying to lift Thor's

481
00:49:03,539 --> 00:49:10,861
hammer, you have Black Bolt destroying Doctor
Strange, and you have Hulk fighting against

482
00:49:10,921 --> 00:49:19,106
the Hulk dogs. This commonality is much harder
for me to determine. I cannot think of a single

483
00:49:19,287 --> 00:49:24,830
damn thing, especially with the Avengers party
kind of throwing a wrench in there. I know

484
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:28,753
that two of the movies were directed by Sam
Raimi. The other one was directed by Joss Whedon.

485
00:49:28,773 --> 00:49:32,956
The other one was directed by Ang Lee. One of
the movies came out in 2003. One of the movies

486
00:49:32,976 --> 00:49:38,880
came out in 2004. And then you have 2015 with
Age of Ultron and Dr. Strange came out in 2022,

487
00:49:40,201 --> 00:49:45,371
I think. Are you Googling this shit? No. Get
off Google. I'm not fucking Googling. That's

488
00:49:45,431 --> 00:49:51,332
all in my brain, motherfucker. I cannot think
of the commonality between those. Is there,

489
00:49:51,472 --> 00:49:57,034
I honestly have no idea. I have no idea. So
you admit that you're inferior as a watcher.

490
00:49:57,514 --> 00:50:01,995
No, I mean, I got all the events correct, but
what's the commonality between them? Are you

491
00:50:02,015 --> 00:50:07,517
ready for the answer? I am ready for the answer.
All films were scored by Danny Elfman. Ah,

492
00:50:07,617 --> 00:50:13,444
shit! Of course they were. Yeah, you're totally
right. Oh, that was a good one. That was really

493
00:50:13,484 --> 00:50:19,548
good. Yeah, yeah, the Spider-Man Sam Raimi franchise,
the 2003 Hulk movie, Multiverse of Madness,

494
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:24,711
and Avengers Age of Ultron were all scored by
Danny Elfman. Although for Age of Ultron, he

495
00:50:24,731 --> 00:50:30,856
was one of many composers on that film. But
that, though, that was a sneaky ass commonality

496
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:37,300
between all the events. Well, I guess since
the Watcher failed the true test of this whole

497
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:43,043
matchup, the Monitor wins. And yet it was the
watcher who was able to correctly identify

498
00:50:43,243 --> 00:50:49,086
every event that happened. So really, the watcher
wins. That doesn't matter. You have to look

499
00:50:49,186 --> 00:50:53,267
deeper at things. Yeah, just like how apparently
you didn't look deep enough at the flashpoint

500
00:50:53,307 --> 00:51:00,030
paradox to remember what the fuck happened in
that movie, obviously. You're the one who cheated

501
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:06,893
by pulling out a direct-to-video animated film.
Who does that? Uh, DC does that. A lot. They

502
00:51:06,913 --> 00:51:11,434
put out a lot of- direct to video animated films.
Blame them. Yeah, but I don't remember any

503
00:51:11,474 --> 00:51:16,921
of them. You don't remember the Flashpoint Paradox,
which is one of DC's best animated projects?

504
00:51:17,222 --> 00:51:22,729
That's fair, that was really good. It honestly
just makes you sound dumb. Like you explained

505
00:51:22,849 --> 00:51:29,390
everything about the plot of that movie without
getting the movie. I mean, the monitor got

506
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:35,355
everything but the title of the project. So
maybe the watchers dumb. Maybe the watchers

507
00:51:35,395 --> 00:51:41,920
tired of your shit and just shoves the monitor.
Oh, oh, look, who's suddenly getting all confrontational.

508
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:46,344
Mr. I swear not to intervene, you know, monitor.
He's going to respond by shoving the watcher

509
00:51:46,384 --> 00:51:51,809
back, but with energy beams from his hands that
just like yeet the watcher into outer space.

510
00:51:52,389 --> 00:51:57,673
I mean, the watcher has interfered before, like
when necessary. Right. And he's all too happy.

511
00:51:58,166 --> 00:52:04,311
right now to interfere with the monitor's face
by rearranging it. So yeah, the watcher gets

512
00:52:04,351 --> 00:52:10,716
blasted back into the cosmos, but suddenly he
disappears in a flash of light and he reappears

513
00:52:10,776 --> 00:52:16,901
behind the monitor. But now he's the size of
a whole planet. And he's going to shoot down

514
00:52:16,961 --> 00:52:21,545
energy beams from his eyes that just disintegrate
the monitor. Yeah, I mean the monitor saw this

515
00:52:21,665 --> 00:52:28,318
coming due to his precognition and cosmic awareness.
So the monitor blocks the eye blast. by beaming

516
00:52:28,478 --> 00:52:34,341
in this massive structure, this tuning fork
tower between him and the Watcher's lasers

517
00:52:34,561 --> 00:52:39,803
before they reach him. And this tower absorbs
those lasers along with all of the Watcher's

518
00:52:39,903 --> 00:52:47,406
energy just draining him so now he's just this
giant floating husk in space. Except that when

519
00:52:47,486 --> 00:52:54,309
the Watcher attacked Monitor, he also telepathically
read his mind and learned all of his secrets.

520
00:52:54,814 --> 00:53:00,116
including his knowledge about this power draining
antenna. Okay, so as the Watcher's power is

521
00:53:00,156 --> 00:53:04,738
being drained, he has a contingency plan. You
know, he has this massive comet from the far

522
00:53:04,778 --> 00:53:11,100
reaches of the solar system fly in and plow
right through that antenna, like a bullet through

523
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:17,743
a gas tank, just unleashing the antenna's energy
in like this sun-sized explosion, and the monitor

524
00:53:17,863 --> 00:53:22,885
dies in the blast. So the match is over. No,
except that the comet actually just passes

525
00:53:23,274 --> 00:53:27,835
right through the antenna because once they
had enough of the watcher's energy, the antenna

526
00:53:27,875 --> 00:53:33,156
sent out this frequency throughout the universe
that shifted it into the sixth dimension where

527
00:53:33,196 --> 00:53:38,698
the watcher is like nothing but an infant and
the monitor can control reality. So the monitor,

528
00:53:38,898 --> 00:53:43,739
you know, he's aboard his ship and he simply
presses a button on his console and the watcher

529
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:49,141
ceases to exist. Match over. Okay, so the monitor
is a cold-hearted bastard who would erase an

530
00:53:49,301 --> 00:53:58,259
infant? Wow. And the Watcher looks like a big
baby! I mean, the Watcher, I'm pretty sure,

531
00:53:58,779 --> 00:54:02,722
is powerful enough to like, you know, thrive
in the sixth dimension. So like, right as the

532
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:09,026
monitor is about to press that eraser button,
all of a sudden time freezes, okay? And the

533
00:54:09,066 --> 00:54:15,191
Watcher is going to peer into a what-if universe
that's called, what if the monitor was a weak,

534
00:54:15,311 --> 00:54:20,790
punk-ass loser? And all of a sudden the fight
gets transported there. where the Watcher just

535
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:27,193
kills the monitor with a backhand slap. You
know, ending the match. Sixth dimensional time

536
00:54:27,273 --> 00:54:33,115
freezing? That is horseshit. Why is that horseshit?
Because it's the sixth dimension, like time

537
00:54:33,155 --> 00:54:37,917
does not even exist. I'm pretty sure it does.
Why are you so confident that the Watcher can

538
00:54:37,997 --> 00:54:44,740
even comprehend anything he's seeing in the
sixth dimension? Because he's the fucking Watcher.

539
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:50,711
That's why he's pretty damn powerful. Again,
horseshit. I say the monitor is a more advanced

540
00:54:50,871 --> 00:54:55,713
being than the watcher. So there's no way the
watcher is going to be able to peer into any

541
00:54:55,733 --> 00:55:00,456
other kind of reality from the sixth dimension.
He's just going to get erased. Oh, we're just

542
00:55:00,476 --> 00:55:04,218
going to take your word for it that he's a more
advanced being than the watcher? Sure. Yeah.

543
00:55:04,778 --> 00:55:08,660
Well, let's find out by taking this fight to
the stats. Okay. We're going to go ahead and

544
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:12,643
plug in their stats, run the simulations and
see which one wins.

545
00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:24,066
Processing results simulations complete. All
right, these guys are super powerful. Definitely

546
00:55:24,106 --> 00:55:29,850
reflected in the stats because all their stats
were almost maxed out. There were a few discrepancies.

547
00:55:30,390 --> 00:55:35,133
We did say that the watcher was more evasive
because he's a little bit more elusive and

548
00:55:35,173 --> 00:55:40,117
behind the scenes than the monitor. And you
know, the watcher often goes invisible. The

549
00:55:40,137 --> 00:55:45,340
monitor is a little bit more concrete. Right.
The monitor though, we said has a lot more

550
00:55:45,581 --> 00:55:51,549
toys at his disposal. He's always carrying around
six dimensional technology that he uses, whereas

551
00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:57,314
the Watcher, he has his Citadel and some of
the items stored there help him out, but largely

552
00:55:57,794 --> 00:56:02,598
he acts through his own power. We also said
that the monitor had a greater perception than

553
00:56:02,638 --> 00:56:07,902
the Watcher because his cosmic awareness extends
across universes and even out into the greater

554
00:56:08,022 --> 00:56:13,427
omniverse. Yeah, yeah, we said that the monitor
essentially observes more than the Watcher.

555
00:56:13,847 --> 00:56:20,237
The Watcher largely relegated to Earth and its
solar system, traditionally speaking. But for

556
00:56:20,277 --> 00:56:25,601
everything else, including intelligence, versatility,
strength, durability, they were all even. The

557
00:56:25,641 --> 00:56:30,125
strangest stat had to be fighting skill. We
had no idea what the heck to do for that one,

558
00:56:30,506 --> 00:56:35,150
but we figured whatever we gave them, they would
be basically even. Yeah, they've both been

559
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:40,054
known to throw down very, very rarely. So yeah,
fighting skill was a hard one to tabulate for

560
00:56:40,094 --> 00:56:43,597
them. With all that said and done though, Jonathan,
who do you think is going to win this match?

561
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:49,451
I think it's going to be the monitor and our
Instagram poll takers agree with me. So far.

562
00:56:50,172 --> 00:56:57,034
Yeah, they are giving the monitor a 54% edge
over the watcher. Last time I checked the watcher

563
00:56:57,054 --> 00:57:00,556
was ahead in that poll. What the hell? It is
kind of surprising to me that the watcher is

564
00:57:00,596 --> 00:57:05,317
not ahead right now considering we just got
off of what if and he was a major player in

565
00:57:05,357 --> 00:57:09,721
that. Well, I mean, I guess the monitor was
in the recent Justice League Crisis on Infinite

566
00:57:09,821 --> 00:57:16,146
Earth's trilogy of films, as well as the Arrow
vs Crisis on Infinite Earth's crossover event.

567
00:57:16,526 --> 00:57:20,910
That's true. Anyway, what does Instagram know?
Let's get the final results of this match.

568
00:57:21,090 --> 00:57:28,677
AJ9K, the results please. Hey Yuasa. Okay, the
winner between the monitor and the watcher

569
00:57:29,657 --> 00:57:37,411
is... The monitor. Hell yeah! It was very close.
Out of 1000 simulated matches, the monitor

570
00:57:37,451 --> 00:57:48,216
won 554 battles, whereas the watcher only won
446. So it's 55.4% over 44.6%. I'm not surprised.

571
00:57:48,296 --> 00:57:53,578
I knew the watcher was powerful, but I also
figured the monitor just operated at a bigger

572
00:57:53,638 --> 00:57:59,001
scale. And the stats sort of reflected that.
Well, I mean, if the monitor is so perceptive,

573
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:03,622
how come he didn't know... what the fucking
end of the Flashpoint paradox was. No, no,

574
00:58:04,283 --> 00:58:10,884
you're comparing Mar Novo to Johnny DC. That's
not a fair comparison. Yeah, I guess you're

575
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:14,646
right. Johnny DC is not that great. Yeah, neither
is Marvelous Joe because he couldn't find the

576
00:58:14,666 --> 00:58:20,367
connection between all of the different four
movies. I may be observant, but I'm not smart.

577
00:58:20,687 --> 00:58:27,149
That's fair. Well, that does it for this duel,
guys. AJ 9K, help close this out. Thanks for
