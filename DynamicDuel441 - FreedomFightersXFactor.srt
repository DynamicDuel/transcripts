00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:27,620
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi and welcome
to the Dynamic Dual Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,640
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,840
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe and I'm his twin

4
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,460
brother Johnny DC. And in this episode, we're
going to find out who would win in a fight between

5
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:49,020
DC's Freedom Fighters and Marvel's X-Factor.
It's a team duel, we're pitting seven characters

6
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,660
from the Freedom Fighters against seven
characters from X-Factor. For an all-out, no

7
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,700
holds barred brawl. We're going to input all the
character stats from simulations to find out who

8
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:03,840
the superior group is. Yeah, this matchup was
chosen by our executive producers in part because

9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,820
both teams have been government-based agencies.
And with Independence Day coming up and July

10
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,180
already being packed full of reviews, we
definitely wanted to get this match in before

11
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,120
then. Yeah, we'll find out which team wins later on
this episode. Before that, we're going to break

12
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,920
down the latest comic book movie news to come out
this past week of which we finally got some news.

13
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,020
There was the new trailer for the Superman movie
announcing that tickets are on sale. There was the

14
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:33,280
second trailer for Iron Heart. And DC Studios
announced that they're making a Mr. Miracle

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,620
animated series. As always, we list our segment
times in our episode description, so feel free to

35
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:30,540
notes to listen to all of the shows and the Diner
Mike podcast network. But with that out of the way,

36
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:38,200
quick to the no prize. A no prize is an award that
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version, the

37
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:43,600
Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award that we
post on Instagram for the person that we feel gave

38
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:49,860
the best answer to our question of the week. Last
week we asked you guys, what Marvel or DC character

39
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,760
that we haven't done a duel with yet, are you still
hoping we get to by January? And this is coming off

40
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,060
of the news that in January, Jonathan and I will
have hit the 10 year anniversary for this podcast.

41
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,960
We'll be turning 40 and we have decided that at that
point, this podcast will no longer be a weekly

42
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,900
show. We'll still do some review episodes when
films come out, but this will be the last year for

43
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,200
dual episodes. Yeah, we got quite a number of
answers, but we're going to break down three

44
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:22,240
honorable mentions before revealing this week's
no prize winner. Our first honorable mention goes

45
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:29,420
to Travis Bailey, who said, What's up, this Travis
Bailey, shout out to my good twin. All right, so I'm

46
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:37,340
not sure if y'all have done any, let me know. I'd
like to see Saber II versus Slade Wilson, for sure.

47
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:44,080
Let me get Gladiator versus Lobo. That could be the
main card. That could be the main event. Jamie

48
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:51,280
Madrox. Madrox and Gorilla Grodd, for sure. And
where's Mephisto? Y'all done Mephisto yet? Y'all

49
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,760
got to get Mephisto in there. All right. So there
were a whole lot of options in this one. We've

50
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,340
actually done a lot of these characters already.
We did Deathstroke versus Deadpool. Saber Tooth,

51
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:06,840
we put against Killer Croc. Lobo, we put against
Carnage. Gorilla Grodd, we put against Scylocke.

52
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,920
And Mephisto, we put against Sandman of the
Enthalas. Yeah, but there are a number of

53
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:18,400
characters he mentioned that we haven't done
duels with, namely, Multiple Man and Gladiator.

54
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,400
Yeah, Gladiator is the head of the Imperial Guard
for the Shiar Alien race. He's basically just like

55
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,040
Superman. With all the weeks planned out for the
rest of the year, by us and the executive producer

56
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,900
team, we won't be able to get to a Gladiator match,
but we've done a lot of duels with Superman-like

57
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:42,240
characters, such as Superman versus Dr. Doom,
Ultraman versus Hyperion, Sentry versus Zod,

58
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:49,020
things like that. And while we won't be getting to a
Multiple Man individual duel, luckily Travis, he

59
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,620
will feature in this duel episode, Freedom
Fighters versus X Factor. Right, so look forward

60
00:05:54,620 --> 00:06:01,080
to that. Great answer, Travis. Our next honorable
mention comes from Matt from Texas, who said, Hey

61
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,420
guys, Matt from Texas here. I want to see the Crime
Syndicate versus the Squadron Supreme. Crime

62
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:11,320
Syndicate's Ultraman, Alman Superwoman, Johnny
Quick, Power Ring, Dead Eye, and White Martian.

63
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,480
Versus the Squadron Supreme's Hyperion, Night
Hawk, Power Princess, Blurred Doctor Spectrum,

64
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:21,440
Golden Archer, and Scrollion Skymaster. I think
it'd be awesome to see two alternate versions of

65
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,840
the Justice League fight each other. That would
have been a great matchup. Essentially, it's Evil

66
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,900
Justice League versus Marvel's version of the
Justice League. But since they're both basically

67
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,200
iterations of the Justice League, we can probably
assume that the match would be close to 50-50,

68
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:42,100
right? It's probably a coin toss. Although I'll
say I really liked Matt's picks for each team. We

69
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,100
have done individual duels with Ultraman versus
Hyperion. Yeah, I think that episode is probably

70
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:52,480
the closest we'll ever get to that match. Which
hurts to say because I really love Squadron

71
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:57,640
Supreme, but we have a lot of other great team duels
coming down the pike. You know, teams like West

72
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:04,580
Coast Avengers. The Inhumans, the Eternals,
Legion of Superheroes, the Authority. So you

73
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:09,040
still got a lot of great team duels coming your way.
So great answer, Matt. Our final honorable

74
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:15,540
mention goes to Alex Albro, who said, Hey guys, I
think you should do a duel between Lois Lane and

75
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:20,140
Mary Jane, our Superwoman versus Jackpot. They
could fight with their powers and compete to write

76
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:26,420
the best article for their respective dailies.
I'd also like to see Kevin Feige versus James Gunn,

77
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:31,880
if you have a chance, and then also the last duel
that I think we all want to see is Johnny DC versus

78
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:37,160
Marvelous Joe. Thanks guys. So actually the last
matchup that you mentioned, Johnny DC versus

79
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,420
Marvelous Joe, Johnny DC would totally win no
contest. What are you talking about? I would stomp

80
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,980
your goofy ass. Don't even try. Actually, we
already ran these simulations for one of our

81
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:55,140
patrons one time, and we did determine I would win
because frankly, I just have more weapons than

82
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:00,660
you. Yeah, I don't really own any weapons. So yeah,
I would get my ass kicked. If it got into close range

83
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,660
though, I'm like quicker than Jonathan, right? So
I just give them like a throat strike and he just

84
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:12,200
beat down for the count. What? No, you're not. I'm
way faster than you. What are you talking about?

85
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:18,500
You know it. I know it. As far as Lois Lane versus
Mary Jane Watson, that was actually a duel that was

86
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,920
pitched by Mickey Mathen-Gian, one of our
executive producers. Although I think we

87
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:28,180
determined that there were just more prominent
super powered characters that we wanted to get to

88
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:34,600
before them. Well, I mean, there are super powered
versions of Lois Lane and Mary Jane Watson. Mary

89
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:41,120
Jane Watson is jackpot in the comic books and she
gets a random power based on this like slot machine

90
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,400
gadget that she has. I don't know if a random power
would help you against the powers of superwoman,

91
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,000
but if she rolls three sevens on her device, she
gets like godlike power. It's a long shot though,

92
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,420
you know, could be interesting, but we're also
trying to get to characters like Abomination and

93
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,100
Ocean Master and Jubilee and Guy Gardner and you
know, some of these big time players that we just

94
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,400
haven't got to yet. But great answer, Alex. We want
to give a quick shout out to Coy and Liao, who also

95
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:13,100
gave the suggestion of Lois Lane versus jackpot.
Cyrus Moore, who said we should do a duel with

96
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,240
L'Arfles, which we won't get to, but we will be
doing other ring powered characters. Daniel

97
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:26,200
Alonso suggested Armadillo, or as I like to call
him, Armadildo, after the Modoc television show.

98
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,880
Jetson Batty also said L'Arfles, Kat Stevenson
said we should do a Hive versus Aime team duel,

99
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,080
that'd be pretty cool. Although we have some Aime
characters coming up in another team duel

100
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,940
episode. Lorenzo Valdez said Lana Lang, who at one
point was superwoman. Yeah, she was like an

101
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,560
electric version. Okay. I really like Sheldon
Moore's answer, who said we should do Superboy

102
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,660
Prime versus Franklin Richards, because that
would also tie into the upcoming reviews we're

103
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:55,400
doing next month with the Superman and Fantastic
Four films. I mean, Superboy Prime would just

104
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:02,940
punch Franklin Richards' reality alterations
really hard, just destroying them. You wish. And

105
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:08,280
then Travis Herndon suggested three matchups,
including Scandal Savage versus Daken, Scar

106
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:13,540
versus Calabac, and Kid Devil versus Robbie
Reyes. Great suggestions, but don't get greedy,

107
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,960
guys. Don't get greedy. Otherwise, I mean, we'd be
doing this forever, which may be what some people

108
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:26,060
want. Who knows. But the winner of this week's No
Prize is Brian Rochester, who said, Hi, I think you

109
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:33,200
should do a DC Universe versus Marvel Universe
universal war. Every character, every team. I

110
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,720
know that's very far fetched, but I think it would
be pretty awesome to see that. I love your show and

111
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,800
sorry to see it go. Bye. Well, funny you should
mention that, Brian, because we might have

112
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,860
something similar to that planned for one of our
final episodes. And I'll just leave it at that. All

113
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:57,740
I could say is I can't wait. It's going to be epic.
Great answer, Brian. Congrats for winning this

114
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,560
week's No Prize. If you, the listener, want to
shout out winning your own No Prize, stay tuned to

115
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,480
later on this episode when we will be asking
another question of the week. And now that that's

116
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:18,240
done, on to the news. OK, with less than a month to go
for the release of the Superman film in theaters,

117
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:24,620
DC last week unveiled what I imagine is its final
trailer for the film announcing that tickets are

118
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:31,540
now on sale. Now, when this film was first
announced by the head of DC Studios, James Gunn,

119
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:37,380
who is also writing and directing this film, he
said one of the inspirations for it was All Star

120
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:44,080
Superman, which was a comic book series written by
Grant Morrison that kind of showcased Superman's

121
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:50,200
last days on Earth. And it was very episodic. He
went up against various villains and various

122
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:57,300
adventures. And of all the trailers to come out for
this film, that very episodic nature of the All

123
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:03,300
Star Superman story feels the most apparent in
this trailer specifically. How so? I didn't get

124
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,500
that vibe at all. There's just so much going on with
all of the different characters that Superman is

125
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:15,220
fighting like Lex Luthor, like an army, giant
Kaiju monsters, portals opening up beneath

126
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:21,900
Metropolis, giant eyeballs in the sky. There's
just so much going on in this film. It seems like

127
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:28,980
it's going to be the most epic Superman movie ever
made. Now, there is a rumor that this film is not

128
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:34,360
going to have like a typical three act structure.
It's going to essentially be like a week in the life

129
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:40,480
of Superman as it were. In fact, they even had like
chapters for this film that would be like Sunday,

130
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,040
Monday, Tuesday. Now that was a rumor. I'm not
exactly sure if it was true, but again, this

131
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:51,980
trailer feels like it's kind of all over the place,
but in a really good and epic way. I didn't feel like

132
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,620
it was all over the place at all. There's a lot of
different types of villains that he's fighting,

133
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,200
but it doesn't seem like it's outside of an
elaborate plan by Lex Luthor, who really seems to

134
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,520
take the spotlight in this trailer. Yeah, I'm not
sure Lex Luthor is responsible for the portal

135
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:09,520
beneath Metropolis or even the Kaiju. I would be
surprised if that was the case. I'm pretty sure

136
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:15,020
that he will be the primary antagonist. But this is
a very, very action packed trailer. That's

137
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:20,100
probably one of the reasons I really like it
because I love seeing Superman in action. Not only

138
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:25,620
do we see him stop a series of toppling buildings,
but we also see him zipping around the skies,

139
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:32,460
battling Kaiju's and other flying super powered
beings. A few of which I actually think might be

140
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:40,700
Samson or Atlas from All Star Superman, just based
on their hairdos, which are a little bit blurry. I

141
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:46,240
think they're intentionally keeping some of the
villains secret in the trailers, which is fine by

142
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,960
me. I mean, there's one guy that he punches in the
face. I hope that's just not a normal human who's

143
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,220
wearing a suit of armor. I think if you get punched
in the face by Superman and you're not super human,

144
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:00,200
your head just explodes. This guy loses some
teeth, but it makes me wonder if Superman pulls his

145
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,520
punches in the same way that Spider-Man does when
he's going up against normal people. Yeah, I'd

146
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,640
like to think that these are some super powered
individuals, because yeah, I don't like the idea

147
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:14,540
of Superman just punching an ordinary human. But
it is cool to see crypto get in on the action as well.

148
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,820
As we see Superman fighting everyone, we also have
this voiceover from Lex Luthor, who's talking

149
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:25,260
about how he's essentially going to kill him and
everyone he loves. It's not the best voiceover,

150
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:31,040
but it does lend credence to the fact that he is the
primary antagonist for this movie and yeah,

151
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,820
probably has an elaborate plot to basically kill
everyone. There's this wild shot of Superman

152
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:45,100
holding a green baby while being wrapped up by this
other like alien octopus creature. I have no idea

153
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,880
what's going on in that scene, but it looks
incredible. It's very different from I think

154
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:55,240
anything we've seen before in a Superman film. Of
course, we also get to see the supporting cast,

155
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:01,460
everyone from Lois Lane, who pilots a high tech
ship alongside Jimmy Olsen and Perry White, as

156
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:07,000
well as the Justice League members Guy Gardner and
Mr. Terrific. They look awesome. I'm assuming

157
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,720
that ship belongs to Mr. Terrific. Maybe, you
know, it's kind of round almost like one of his

158
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,280
T-Spheres. That's a good guess, I would say. One of
the final shots of the trailer, we see Mr. Terrific

159
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:24,180
call down to Superman, who looks really beat up
like he has two black eyes and he's facing down this

160
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:30,020
portal beneath the city. Now, are those black eyes
or has he just been using his heat vision and that's

161
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:35,620
like heat scarring? I didn't get the impression. I
would hope that using his heat vision would not

162
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:40,660
give him scarring of any kind. I think it would
temporarily if he did a big enough heat vision

163
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:47,460
blast. I don't think I would like that personally.
Who knows? Again, the scale of this movie just

164
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:53,380
looks so massive. And I love the fact that James
Gunn seems to be giving Superman these challenges

165
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:58,580
that really only Superman can face. Because what
are characters like the X-Men or Spider-Man gonna

166
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:04,740
do when a massive black hole seems to open up
beneath the city? What is Superman gonna do? I

167
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,720
guess we'll find out. All I know is he's probably
gonna save the day and I can't wait to find out how.

168
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,340
Probably my favorite moment from this trailer is
also near the end where we see Superman surrounded

169
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:20,600
by these flying villains. And he's just blasting
all of them with heat vision while spinning around

170
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:27,080
super fast. It may be one of the coolest things I've
ever seen Superman do on screen. And I can't wait to

171
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:33,700
see it in theaters. This trailer totally sold me on
getting tickets for the film. I bought mine. I hope

172
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:38,700
you guys have too because it looks like it's gonna
be epic, especially on a really big screen like

173
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:46,160
IMAX. I'm gonna go see it on the smallest screen I
can. Sucks to suck, I guess. But considering all of

174
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,120
the cool stuff that we get to see Superman do in this
trailer, that brings us to our question of the

175
00:16:51,120 --> 00:17:02,740
week. What has been your favorite Superman moment
from past films or television series? And why? And

176
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,660
this includes animated films and television
shows that Superman has been a part of, going all

177
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,060
the way back to the 1940s. Record your answer at

181
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:33,360
Duel No Prize that we'll post to Instagram. Be sure
to answer before June 21st. In way better news,

182
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:39,380
this past week we got the official trailer number
two for the upcoming Iron Heart television series

183
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:44,880
that's going to be released on Disney Plus,
starting on June 24th. Now Disney Plus is

184
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,300
releasing three episodes of the six episode
series all at once. So basically half the show

185
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:56,600
starting on June 24th, and then I think the
subsequent episodes will be released weekly. But

186
00:17:56,600 --> 00:18:01,980
this particular trailer is probably the most
exciting look at the show that we've gotten yet, in

187
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:07,900
that it introduces the concept of
re-re-incorporating magic into her armor

188
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:14,700
system. Which is pretty damn cool visually,
because as we see her heads up display come up, we

189
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:19,320
see like sigils and runes and things like that.
It's a really cool concept that they briefly

190
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,640
touched upon in the comic books, where we've seen
her incorporate like the 10 rings into her armor.

191
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,740
And I remember one time she fought alongside Dr.
Strange, and she like accessed the Wellspring, I

192
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:34,980
think it was called, and she was shooting out like
magic repulsors. I'm pretty positive all this

193
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:42,280
magic occult stuff ties into the primary villain
of the show, who is the hood, who gets his powers via

194
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,920
the demon Mephisto. Oh I thought Mephisto was
going to be the primary villain. Do you think Riri

195
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:53,600
like sells her soul to get these powers? I think she
makes a deal with the hood, who is in turn powered by

196
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,080
Mephisto. So it's going to be something like that.
But it's interesting because this whole time we

197
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:06,180
thought that the show was going to be this set it off
style story where we see Riri steal in order to work

198
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:10,380
on her armor designs. But it looks like she
actually goes much further than simply stealing,

199
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:15,940
but she in fact taps into dark magic. So we're
definitely going to see her go down the rabbit hole

200
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:21,340
as it were, and redeem herself by the end
hopefully. Yeah I had no idea that she had a history

201
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:27,220
of tapping into magical sources in the comics.
That's interesting. Actually that's definitely

202
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,640
the most interesting thing I've seen come out of
all of these trailers. I would agree with you. Well

203
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:37,560
I mean it's not something that she regularly does
in the comic books, but there is precedent for

204
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:42,300
including magic in this type of story. One of the
other big reveals that we got in this trailer is

205
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:48,860
that the show will be including her AI assistant
named Natalie, and that she will be a 3D

206
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:54,300
holographic projection, not just a voice within
the armor, kind of like how Jarvis and Friday were

207
00:19:54,300 --> 00:20:00,540
with Tony Stark's armor. I thought in the comics
that Tony Stark was her like AI assistant. No when

208
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,020
he was dead for a time in the comic books his digital
consciousness did serve as like a mentor figure

209
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:10,380
early on, but no he wasn't her AI assistant like
Natalie was. When Natalie was like who the hell

210
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:17,800
else would it be, Bish? I was like Tony Stark? Yeah
Tony Stark is the answer to that question. I didn't

211
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:22,120
love that line at all. That was just horrible
writing. You know who else I thought delivered

212
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:28,120
terrible lines? Alden Ehrenreich. I'm still
pretty confused as to what his role is going to be in

213
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:33,400
this show. Well as I mentioned before he's playing
Joe McGillicuddy who is an original character for

214
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:39,420
this series. I think he's kind of serving as a Tony
Stark stand-in taking on that mental role from the

215
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,560
comic books. I agree it's not great dialogue. The
whole taking things apart and putting it back

216
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:49,100
together really gives off watchman vibes. And
also I just don't like the idea of him being her

217
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:54,500
mentor. Like where is Shuri? Why isn't she
mentoring Riri? That's a great question. Yeah

218
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:59,880
considering that Shuri helped facilitate her
previous armor in Wakanda Forever you think she'd

219
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,280
be keeping tabs on her or something like that. In
the same way that the Dorya Milaje was keeping tabs

220
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:10,400
on Bucky. Right right right and maybe they'll show
up who knows. All I know is that I'm way more excited

221
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:17,900
for this show than Superman. And all I know is you
picked a hell of a week to stop sniffing glue. Going

222
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:24,140
back to DC news recently it was announced that DC
Studios is putting out its second animated series

223
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:30,800
after Kichir Commandos in Mr. Miracle which is
going to be based off of Tom King's Eisner

224
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:37,140
award-winning mini series. We got our first look
at the show in a single frame that looks like it was

225
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,380
ripped right from the comics. And we also got a
series description about how essentially Mr.

226
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:48,580
Miracle will be battling Darkseid who attains the
anti-life equation the result of which is

227
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:54,640
fracturing Mr. Miracle's mind. Now the comic book
series that this is based on dealt heavily with

228
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:03,540
themes of like PTSD and depression. I'm not sure
it's the best storyline to introduce the new gods.

229
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:10,280
I especially don't love the idea of our
introduction to Darkseid having him already

230
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:15,180
attain the anti-life equation like that's
something you should absolutely build up to. So

231
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:21,760
while I love the idea that Mr. Miracle is finally
getting his own show I don't love the storyline

232
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,900
that they will be basing it off of. Well they might
alter the storyline a little bit to accommodate

233
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:32,100
the greater DCU that they're establishing. It
could be more of like a personal story than

234
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:38,140
touching on the larger plot behind that arc. I
think the show has a lot of work cut out for it. Not

235
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:44,460
only does it need to introduce us to Jack Kirby's
fourth world and that whole cast of characters but

236
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:51,620
it also needs to be a personal story set within a
larger world that James Gunn is developing

237
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,780
essentially. Well he did a good job with that in
Creature Commanders. But that was a fairly

238
00:22:55,780 --> 00:23:00,220
self-contained story. When you're involving
characters like Darkseid and things like the

239
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:06,160
anti-life equation if that doesn't affect other
DC projects I would feel like they would have made a

240
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:11,280
mistake because really Darkseid and the
anti-life equation should be a Justice League

241
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,340
level threat not just Mr. Miracle and Big Barda. I
guess it would be like saving Thanos and the

242
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:24,020
Infinity Gauntlet for an animated series as
opposed to a whole saga of films. Exactly. I doubt

243
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:29,380
they would do that and even if they do there's still
plenty of other large scale DC threats out there

244
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:34,780
for the films to touch on. Now there is a way in which
they could keep this self-contained that would

245
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:41,540
basically be to have Mr. Miracle contained within
an Omega Sanction which is a trap essentially set

246
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:47,520
by Darkseid in which Mr. Miracle would just relive
countless lives over and over. We'll see if they go

247
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:52,120
that route. They would almost need to. I think that
would be pretty cool actually. We'll have to keep

248
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:58,040
an eye on who they cast as the voice actors for these
different characters because as James Gunn has

249
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:04,100
said he wants there to be as much crossover between
the animation voice actors and live action actors

250
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:09,820
as possible. And here's hoping we get a live action
new gods movie one day. I think most fans know that

251
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:16,000
they try to get a live action new gods film off the
ground in the DCEU days with a film directed by Ava

252
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,420
DuVernay but that didn't come to fruition. It is
nice to see this fourth world stuff finally get off

253
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:25,540
the ground and hopefully it's done well. Yeah I
hope so. We don't know what network this is going to

254
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:31,000
be on. It may not be on HBO Max. I guess they're
shopping it around so we'll see where it ends up and

255
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:42,060
when it gets released. But that does it for all the
news for this episode so let's go ahead and move

256
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:47,300
into our main event where we find out who'd win in a
fight between the two teams of the Freedom

257
00:24:47,300 --> 00:25:08,260
Fighters and X Factor. Alright Freedom Fighters
versus X Factor as we mentioned earlier these are

258
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:13,840
two teams that have been backed by the government
going up against each other. That's kind of their

259
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,700
thematic through line here although X Factor has
definitely spent time on its own not being

260
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,540
government sanctioned but I think the most
prominent version of the X Factor team was

261
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:29,520
spearheaded by government agent Valerie Cooper.
Who's that? Yeah I guess that means nothing to you

262
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,000
if you don't know the comic books but she had a lot of
dealings with like the X-Men books putting

263
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,940
together like Freedom Force. I go into it in our
Mystique versus Madame Rouge episode. Wait

264
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:44,660
Freedom Force why does that sound familiar?
Because that was Mystique's team of mutants like

265
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:48,560
the second iteration of the Brotherhood of
Mutants that were working for the government.

266
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,440
They were kind of like Marvel's version of the
Suicide Squad for a while. I'm sorry the correct

267
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:58,600
answer was because it's a ripoff of Freedom
Fighters. Now the Freedom Fighters actually had

268
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,900
their own animated movie of sorts I guess you could
say they featured heavily in the Rey animated

269
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:09,600
series which was set in the Arrowverse. Oh
interesting Yeah X Factor hasn't had their own

270
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,460
show or series or anything like that but a lot of the
characters have already played roles within the

271
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:20,800
live action X-Men films. Yeah characters like
Havoc were in the X-Men first class movies.

272
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:26,980
Polaris was in that one X-Men TV show I forget the
name. Yeah the Gifted but Ice Man of course was in

273
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:32,240
the movies. Multiple Man made an appearance in
X-Men 3. Beast of course was in the films. A whole

274
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:37,120
bunch of them. Maybe if things go well for the DCU
one day we'll get a Freedom Fighters movie who

275
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,980
knows. Oh that'd be cool. I'll say that there is an
impressive roster of characters on that team and

276
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:47,080
we'll discuss that soon but to explain the
methodology behind our duels let's go to our

277
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:52,680
sentient duel simulator Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K
tell our listeners how you go about determining a

278
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:58,600
winner in our team duel matchups. Yes of course sir
the way I determine a winner between the two teams

279
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,620
is by running 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations
between every character on each team using their

280
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:08,800
statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation is a
probabilistic model used to determine outcomes

281
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:14,700
through random sampling. In this case I randomize
the statistics along a normal distribution as a

282
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:19,620
way to simulate the many variables that can occur
during battle. The stat parameters are based on

283
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:24,680
the official Marvel power grid from which the DC
characters statistics are extrapolated.

284
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:29,780
Additional stat categories are included such as
range, damage potential, versatility and

285
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:35,540
perception in order to create a more detailed and
accurate simulation. The results of the 49,000

286
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:40,740
simulations provide a percentage of wins for each
character on both teams. The team with the higher

287
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:46,080
average win rate is declared the victor as they
have a higher probability to win any given battle.

288
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:51,280
In an equitable pairing neither team should win
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have

289
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:56,200
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat
Superman so the confidence rate of my method falls

290
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,940
in line with the precedents that have been
established in the source material. My

291
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,540
mathematical simulations are without
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole

292
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:11,120
consideration nor are fan votes tabulated for
determination of the winner. Thanks A.J .9K.

293
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,800
Before we run the simulations though we like to
break down each team's histories and rosters

294
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:21,540
before improvising a scenario on how we imagine
one of the thousands of simulations would play out

295
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:27,780
beat for beat. And it's my turn to go first with the
DC team's backstory so let me tell you about the

296
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:32,880
Freedom Fighters. Now the Freedom Fighters began
as a group of American superheroes brought

297
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:40,060
together during World War II by the mysterious
patriotic figure known as Uncle Sam. More than a

298
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:46,040
man Uncle Sam was the living embodiment of
American ideals, a spiritual force that had taken

299
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:51,780
form to protect the nation during times of crisis.
You can of course learn more about Uncle Sam in our

300
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:58,980
Uncle Sam vs Captain Burr in dual episode. As war
erupted across the globe Uncle Sam foresaw grave

301
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:05,580
danger ahead not just from the Nazis on earth but
from a parallel world where the Axis powers had

302
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:12,380
already won. That world was Earth X, a twisted
mirror of earth where the Nazis won the war and were

303
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:18,640
taking control of the entire planet. In an effort
to prevent the same fate from befalling his own

304
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,780
world, Uncle Sam assembled a team of heroes to
travel to Earth X and resist its oppressive

305
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:31,760
regime. His earliest group included lesser known
heroes like Neon the Unknown, Magno, Miss

306
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:37,360
America, and the Invisible Hood among others.
They attempted to prevent the attack on Pearl

307
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,540
Harbor but failed. Most of the team actually
perished in the mission with seemingly only Uncle

308
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:51,360
Sam surviving. Undeterred, Uncle Sam assembled a
second team consisting of Black Condor, Dollman,

309
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:58,600
the Human Bomb, the Ray, Phantom Lady, and the Red
Bee. They joined Uncle Sam on Earth X where they

310
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:04,860
continued to fight against the Nazi regime that
had overrun the planet. Tragically, the Red Bee

311
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:10,880
was killed during their first mission, rescuing
the hero Our Man from a Nazi villain known as Baron

312
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:16,320
Blitzkrieg. Eventually, the team liberated
Earth X with the help of the Justice League from

313
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,660
Earth One and the Justice Society from Earth Two.
You could learn more about both teams in their team

314
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:28,240
duels against the Avengers and Fantastic Four
respectively. After their success, the Freedom

315
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,940
Fighters became bored with peace and sought new
challenges. They migrated to Earth One where a

316
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:40,020
misunderstanding with authorities led them to be
wrongfully accused of terrorism. Framed by a

317
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:45,800
villain called the Silver Ghost, the team became
fugitives, struggling to clear their names while

318
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:51,020
fending off both supervillains and law
enforcement. They set up a base in New York City's

319
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:57,100
East Armory and continued operating as heroes
while being hunted by the authorities. While the

320
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:03,180
team faced many threats including alien war
makers and demons like Kamulus, they briefly

321
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:09,160
added new members like Firebrand and battled
alongside Superman, eventually preventing a

322
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:16,120
neo-Nazi plot to destroy American foundational
documents. After that, they returned to Earth X.

323
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:21,360
When the crisis on Infinite Earths destroyed
Earth X and folded its history into a single

324
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:32,000
continuity known as New Earth, the Freedom
Fighters were retroactively made a part of the

325
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,880
All-Star Squadron, a wartime superhero
collective that included other teams like the

326
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:43,040
Seven Soldiers of Victory and the Justice
Society. With Uncle Sam having mysteriously

327
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:49,240
vanished, the Freedom Fighters eventually faded
into obscurity. In modern times, Uncle Sam

328
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:55,100
re-emerged as the spirit of America, taking on a
new form as the Patriot during an intergalactic

329
00:31:55,100 --> 00:32:01,160
conflict known as the Imperiax War. He gathered
together a new team of Freedom Fighters including

330
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:08,540
Damage, Iron Man Rowe, and new versions of Black
Condor, Phantom Lady, and the Wray. They later

331
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:13,880
worked with the Justice Society and operated as
federal agents. This team eventually met

332
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,020
disaster while investigating superhuman
activity during another crisis event. Black

333
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,780
Condor, Phantom Lady, and the Human Bomb were all
killed by members of the Seeker Society of

334
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:29,400
Supervillains. Damage was gravely injured and
Wray was captured while Uncle Sam vanished once

335
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:34,520
again. With their leader presumed dead and most of
the team destroyed, the Freedom Fighters

336
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:40,640
effectively ceased to exist. Uncle Sam returned
years later, resurrected in the Mississippi

337
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,880
River. With a new sense of purpose and warning of a
corrupt government on the rise, he recruited a new

338
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,740
generation of heroes. Among them were new
versions of Firebrand, Dullman, Human Bomb,

339
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:57,960
Phantom Lady, and the Wray. These new Freedom
Fighters had previously served as agents of the

340
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:04,400
shadowy government agency, Shade, led by the
immortal Father Time. Uncle Sam opposed their

341
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:10,160
brutal methods and convinced them to join his
fight against tyranny. Operating from a surreal

342
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:15,800
extra-dimensional base called the Heartland,
the new team continued to add members, including a

343
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:22,800
new Black Condor, Red Bee, and Invisible Hood.
Their main enemy became Father Time himself, who

344
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:28,880
was working to install a mechanical doppelganger
of a U.S. Senator, Gonzo, the mechanical bastard,

345
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,880
as President of the United States. Uncle Sam
discovered the plot and tried to expose Gonzo, but

346
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,880
was captured along with his team by a new Miss
America, secretly one of Father Time's agents.

347
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:47,200
The team was rescued by reinforcements that
included the resurrected original Miss America,

348
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,580
who defeated her imposter. With new allies like
the Second Wray, who you can learn more about in our

349
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:58,880
Wray vs. Havoc episode, the team regrouped and
fought back. They exposed Gonzo's identity in a

350
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,160
public press conference, just as he unleashed an
army of mind-controlled metahumans. Father

351
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:09,600
Time, betrayed by Gonzo, switched sides and
helped trap the robotic tyrant inside a special

352
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:15,060
containment device. Before vanishing into the
time stream with brainwashed metas, Father Time

353
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:27,940
revealed The president appointed the Freedom
Fighters as directors of Shade, though some

354
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:34,159
members, like the Rey, chose to return to civilian
life. Their next battles were no less strange.

355
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,380
They stopped a rogue nuclear launch orchestrated
by the calculator and later dealt with the bizarre

356
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:45,320
evolution of the Red Bee, who had been transformed
into a human insect hybrid. Shade tried turning

357
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:51,560
the team into media icons, but not everyone agreed
with this direction. Several members, including

358
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:58,520
Uncle Sam, Dullman, Human Bomb, and Firebrand,
returned to the heartland in protest. Others

359
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:03,920
remained and formed a new group called the
Crusaders. The Red Bee's condition worsened and

360
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,200
she eventually lost control to her insectoid
instincts, enslaving the Crusaders and the

361
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:14,020
Freedom Fighters through pheromones. A massive
battle erupted between the brainwashed heroes

362
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:20,080
culminating in the intervention of Linkford
Tarrell, who had inherited the power of Nyand

363
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:26,580
Yen-None. He cured Red Bee of the infestation and
the team stopped an insectoid invasion. Despite

364
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:31,920
the victory, however, the group dissolved again.
Though Uncle Sam vowed they would return when

365
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:37,380
needed. In post-Flashpoint continuity, the
Freedom Fighters appeared in alternate forms

366
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:42,840
across the multiverse. On Earth 10, they were
reimagined as a resistance force fighting

367
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:49,260
against a Nazi regime that had won World War II with
the help from Overman, a Superman-like figure

368
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,940
raised under fascism. The team's members were
genetically engineered by Dr. Savanna to

369
00:35:54,940 --> 00:36:00,920
represent an inclusive, modern resistance
movement. It included alternate versions of Rey,

370
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:11,100
Black Condor, Phantom Lady, and Dullman, and the
destruction of a Justice League orbital station

371
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:17,000
over Metropolis. On the main Earth, a Chinese
version of the Freedom Fighters appeared, led by

372
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,160
the flying Dragon General. Members included
analogues of the original team, such as Sunbeam

373
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:30,440
for the Rey, Blue Condor, Ghost Woman, Folding
Paper Man, who was a version of Plastic Man, and

374
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:36,220
Human Firecracker. These characters embodied
nationalistic ideals tailored to China,

375
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:41,760
reflecting how the legacy of the Freedom Fighters
had spread beyond the United States. Recently,

376
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,500
the original Freedom Fighters surviving
members, including Uncle Sam and Phantom Lady,

377
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,980
reappeared during a discussion between Mr.
Trevick and Quiz Kid. There were shown mentoring,

378
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:56,900
the time-lost Sidekicks Cherry Bomb, and
Ladybug, young heroes who had once been

379
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:02,620
associated with the original human bomb and Red
Bee. And that's the Freedom Fighters history so

380
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:09,160
far. Now, for my 7-person roster for the Freedom
Fighters, I of course started with Uncle Sam, the

381
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,720
leader of the team, and the one responsible for
bringing various incarnations together. I'm

382
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,040
also going with the original team members of Black
Condor, capable of flight thanks to his wind

383
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:26,320
control, and the Rey, a being composed of pure
light energy, both of whom you can learn more about

384
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:32,940
in our Black Condor vs. Warpath and Rey vs. Havoc
episodes. Original members we haven't done duels

385
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:39,040
with yet that are on my team include Phantom Lady,
who can turn visible, intangible, and create

386
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:44,880
holographic illusions, the human bomb, who
possesses a powerful explosive touch, as well as

387
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:51,780
superhuman durability, and Dollman, the 6-inch
telekinetic. For the 7th and final member of my

388
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:57,760
team, I decided to go with Plastic Man, a
short-lived member of the team, yet hands down the

389
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:03,340
most popular character from Quality Comics,
where all of these characters originated prior to

390
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:08,840
DC's acquisition of that company. And you of
course can learn more about Plastic Man in his duel

391
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:17,200
against Mr. Fantastic. So to reiterate, my team
consists of Uncle Sam, Black Condor, Rey, Phantom

392
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:24,840
Lady, Human Bomb, Dollman, and Plastic Man. Yeah,
I really like that roster except for Dollman, who

393
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:31,620
is probably the worst DC character ever. You say
that about every DC character. That's true, but I

394
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:36,600
really mean it this time. Dollman's basically
just an action figure with telekinesis. And his

395
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:42,840
name is Dollman. You should be ashamed. Hey,
here's an acquisition, man. You came with the

396
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:47,640
whole package. What are you gonna do? Well, I can
guarantee you there's no one named Dollman on X

397
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,140
Factor, although some members did have some
pretty lame names like Strong Guy. Although

398
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:58,460
Guido's power was pretty cool. Let me tell you all
about X Factor. The five original X-Men, Cyclops,

399
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:04,660
Gene Gray, Angel, Beast, and Iceman, reunited
after Gene Gray was discovered alive after being

400
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:10,120
thought dead and was temporarily replaced by the
cosmic entity known as the Phoenix Force, an event

401
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:15,620
you can learn more about in our Raven vs. Phoenix
duel episode. The group, feeling out of place on a

402
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:22,000
team now led by their old enemy, Magneto, formed X
Factor Incorporated with Angel using his wealth

403
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,420
to fund the operation. To the public, X Factor was a
group of mutant hunters who captured dangerous

404
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:34,560
individuals for pay. In truth, the team found and
sheltered young mutants in an effort to help them

405
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:40,020
control and develop their newfound abilities.
While hunting the Alliance of Evil, they met

406
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:45,200
Apocalypse, an ancient mutant who preached
survival of the fittest. He vanished after

407
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:50,080
testing their strength in their first encounter,
promising to return. Soon, the villain Mr.

408
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:54,720
Sinister's mutant henchmen known as the
Marauders butchered a group of mutants called the

409
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,640
Morlocks who were living in the sewers under
Manhattan. Angel rushed in to help and the killers

410
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:05,700
severely damaged his wings. Broken and bitter, he
tried to attempt suicide but Apocalypse saved him

411
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:11,480
and experimented on him, giving him metal wings
and blue skin. Angel was transformed into Death,

412
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:16,460
one of Apocalypse's agents known as the Four
Horsemen. Angel later broke free of his mind to

413
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:20,880
control, yet his new form and the name Archangel
stayed with him. You can learn more about

414
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:25,860
Archangel and Apocalypse in their respective
duels against Zoriel and Black Adam.

415
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:31,160
Apocalypse's horseman attacked Central Park,
and X Factor saved thousands of civilians, many

416
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,280
belonging to the same crowd that had cursed
mutants in fear. With Apocalypse defeated, the

417
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:41,920
team moved into his captured living starship, a
base big enough for all their young students.

418
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:48,920
Later, demons warped the mind of Cyclops' wife and
Jean's clone named Madeleine Pryor, turning her

419
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:54,000
into a possessed villain known as the Goblin
Queen. She tried to sacrifice her and Cyclops' son

420
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Nathan on the Empire State Building, but X Factor
and the X-Men teamed up to stop her. However,

421
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,200
Apocalypse soon kidnapped Nathan and infected
him with a techno-organic virus to kill him.

422
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,000
Rebels from 2000 years into the future traveled to
the present and took the baby forward in time to

423
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,140
save him. He would return later as the hero Cable,
whom you can learn more about in his dual episode

424
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:20,740
against Booster Gold. After a final fight on Muir
Island against the evil psychic entity Shadow

425
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:28,200
King, the founding five X Factor members rejoined
the X-Men and X Factor closed its first chapter.

426
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,000
You can learn more about the X-Men in their team
dual against the Titans. Federal agent Valerie

427
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:39,020
Cooper believed the United States needed a public
mutant team and asked Cyclops' brother Havoc to

428
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:44,220
lead a government-backed X Factor. Cooper also
brought aboard Lorna Dane, a magnetic-powered

429
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:50,080
mutant called Polaris. When Lorna was a young
teen, her parents argued mid-flight on a private

430
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:55,960
plane. The stress triggered her hidden magnetism
power, which tore the plane apart and turned her

431
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:02,140
hair green. The mutant magneto sensed the
magnetic pulse and rescued Lorna, later learning

432
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:07,060
that she was his daughter. He left her with
relatives to grow up safely and as an adult, she

433
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:12,820
joined the X-Men and later joined Havoc as the
second X Factor recruit. Valerie Cooper also

434
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:18,640
contacted Jamie Madrox, the mutant known as
Multiple Man. From the moment Jamie was born, when

435
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:24,020
the doctor slapped his baby behind, the child
split into a perfect duplicate. Born with the

436
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:29,620
mutant power of kinetic duplication, Jamie wore a
suit that absorbed his shocks so he would not keep

437
00:42:29,620 --> 00:42:35,180
dividing. Years later, after leaving his Kansas
farm, the X-Men's leader Professor Xavier

438
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:41,280
discovered and taught Jamie how to reabsorb his
duplicates and keep their memories. As Multiple

439
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,440
Man, he became the team's instant backup. Wolf
Spain, a Scott's girl who could shift into a wolf,

440
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,840
signed on next. Strong Guy, who stored impact
energy as muscle and the speedster Quicksilver,

441
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:59,660
rounded out the new squad. Together, they stopped
Mr. Sinister, foiled extremists in the war-torn

442
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:05,300
Middle East, and guarded witnesses from mutant
killers like Cyber. On the island of Genosha, when

443
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:10,480
one of Multiple Man's duplicates caught the
lethal legacy virus and died, the team feared the

444
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,380
original Multiple Man was lost. Strong Guy
absorbed an alien bomb blast over Magipore and

445
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:22,440
suffered a heart attack that put him in a coma.
Havoc, quit in grief, and Forge, a mutant inventor

446
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:27,860
who could build any device he imagined, became the
team's new leader. Washington soon forced

447
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:33,020
Mystique and the Feral Sabertooth onto the
roster, but soon, funding dried up and the

448
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:38,100
government squad dissolved. The original
Multiple Man later resurfaced in New York's

449
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:44,120
mutant town and opened X-Factor Investigations,
a private detective agency. He hired Wolfsbane

450
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:50,180
and the recovered Strong Guy, also welcoming
Teresa Cassidy into the agency. Teresa, called

451
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:56,480
Siren, could shatter steel with her sonic scream.
Raised by her criminal uncle, Black Tom Cassidy,

452
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:03,000
she once aided him in robberies, unaware that her
real father was the heroic X-Men member Banshee,

453
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,680
from whom she acquired her powers. After being
caught stealing by Spider-Woman, Siren chose a

454
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:14,120
better path with X-Factor Investigations. The
mutants Monet, St. Croix, and Richter joined

455
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:19,460
next, followed by Leila Miller, a team with hidden
knowledge about the mass loss of mutant powers

456
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:24,800
around the world caused by the Scarlet Witch, an
event you can learn more about in her duel against

457
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:31,000
Zatana. When the X-Factor detectives outsmarted
the rival firm, Singularity Investigations, the

458
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:36,460
anti-mute agency retaliated by firing a
power-dampening dart into Siren's throat,

459
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:40,560
temporarily stripping her upper power.
Quicksilver later appeared with Tarogen

460
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:45,560
crystals stolen from the Inhumans that could
restore a mutant's lost powers, but also cripple

461
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:51,640
the user. X-Factor exposed the risk and drove him
off. You can learn more about this in our Flash vs.

462
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:56,680
Quicksilver episode. Leila Miller later
followed a multiple-man duplicate into a future

463
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,540
where mutants were jailed, while the present
multiple-man battled Cortex, who was a rogue

464
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:07,020
duplicate who had become an evil murderer. The
billionaire Cade bombed New York's mutant town,

465
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:12,760
forcing the agency to move to Detroit. After Siren
was impregnated by multiple-man, or perhaps one

466
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:18,060
of his duplicates, she gave birth to a boy named
Sean, named after her father. However, while

467
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:23,080
holding the infant, multiple-man involuntary
absorbed his child, who was born with the same

468
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:29,120
powers, an act that devastated both parents.
Later, when Polaris' mind unraveled after being

469
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:34,900
tortured by Apocalypse, Siren bargained with the
Celtic goddess Morrigan for power that healed

470
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:40,400
Lorna, yet bound Siren to the deity's service.
During these struggles, Jaime recruited

471
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:45,420
Longshot to the agency, a genetically engineered
rebel from the television ratings-obsessed

472
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:51,600
dimension of Mojo World. Longshot had enhanced
physiology, limited psychometry, throwing

473
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:56,760
knives, and a subconscious gift to bent
probability in his favor. After finding an

474
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:02,140
interdimensional portal to Earth, he helped the
X-Men repel an invasion by Mojo, his impossible

475
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:07,300
luck earning him the moniker Longshot. When the
agency dissolved, Polaris accepted an offer from

476
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:12,520
several industries to lead a short-lived,
corporate-backed X-Factor team with Gambit,

477
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:17,820
Quicksilver, Danger, Cipher, and Warlock on the
team. During this time, they rescued mutant

478
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:23,760
hostages from the evil science organization AIM,
retrieved stolen data from the Thieves Guild, and

479
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,280
prevented a potential threat by the tech-narci,
an artificially intelligent alien race. When

480
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:34,680
Professor Xavier founded the island nation of
Cracowa, the mutant North Star formed another

481
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:41,360
X-Factor team. He drafted Polaris, his twin
sister Aurora, Wolverine's son Daken, the

482
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:47,100
power-mimicking prodigy, illusion-spotting
i-boy, and the telepathic prestige. Their

483
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:51,880
assigned task for their new nation was to confirm a
mutant's death so that Cracowa's resurrection

484
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:57,280
protocols would not create accidental
duplicates. The team's first cases took them into

485
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:02,800
Mojo World's lethal live streams, and later to
Alberta, Canada, after Siren, who was still bound

486
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:08,440
to Morrigan, repeatedly caused her own death in
order to stall the Celtic Deity's mass sacrifice

487
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:13,240
of every mutant on Cracowa. The mutant
Shatterstar's dimension-cutting swords killed

488
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:18,340
the goddess, freeing Siren from her control.
X-Factor later investigated the mysterious

489
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:23,820
death of the Scarlet Witch on Cracowa, though it
was determined to be an elaborate ruse by her and

490
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:30,480
Magneto. Their plan used Chaos Magic to establish
on Cracowa a magic plane of existence called the

491
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,580
Waiting Group, which allowed Cerebro to scan
through time for mutants to use in Cracowa's

492
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:41,180
resurrection protocols, ensuring that every
mutant who had ever died, past or future, had a

493
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:46,900
chance at resurrection. This plane, however, was
destroyed during the fall of Cracowa. That's

494
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:51,520
X-Factor's history. For the seven-person
roster, I'm going with a mix of mutants from across

495
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:57,120
the various iterations of the team. This includes
the original members Beast and Iceman, who formed

496
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:01,700
the first X-Factor alongside their original
X-Men teammates, and both have their own

497
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:08,020
individual duels. Also on my team are Havoc,
Polaris, and multiple men who were founding

498
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:13,780
members of the X-Factor's government team. Out of
that group, only Havoc has his own duel. And for my

499
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:20,900
final two, I'm going with members of the X-Factor
Investigations Agency, Siren, and Longshot. So

500
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:28,900
to reiterate, that's Beast, Iceman, Havoc,
Polaris, multiple men, Siren, and Longshot.

501
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:33,360
Yeah, this is a solid roster, and I'm actually
surprised some of those members like Iceman and

502
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:39,900
Beast haven't been in previous team duel episodes
with other X-Men characters. I'm glad we finally

503
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:44,640
get around with them. Yeah, for sure. Some of my
favorite X-Men characters of all time are members

504
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:50,520
of X-Factor. I'm a huge Jamie Madrox fan, multiple
man, and while it's a shame we won't be doing an

505
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:55,400
individual duel with him, I'm glad to at least be
doing this team duel with the character. Yeah, he

506
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:00,820
has one of the coolest powers in comics, I think. If
I could have any super power, like my list of top

507
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:06,540
five would definitely be multiple man's powers.
Yeah, and his Madrox series and X-Factor written

508
00:49:06,540 --> 00:50:07,820
by Peter David rest in peace, he did a phenomenal
job writing Jamie Madrox as a character. Now that

509
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:11,800
we've got the teams, histories, and rosters out of
the way, let's speculate on how one of the

510
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,840
thousands of simulated matches will go. The
winners determined by simulations, not our

511
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:21,960
speculation, but it's fun to imagine how the fight
could play out. AJ and IK, what are the rules of our

512
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:27,080
speculation? Well, I should say there are no
rules, other than the teams have no prior

513
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:31,980
knowledge of the other going into the fight. All
they are aware of starting out is that the other

514
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:36,820
side is a threat that needs to be eliminated. For
the speculation, the groups will begin

515
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:41,740
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript
environment that will have no bearing on the match

516
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:47,260
itself, as no environmental statistics are
considered in my simulations. The teams must earn

517
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:52,760
victory on their own merit. All right, then let's
get into it. Freedom fighters and X-Factor meet on

518
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:58,280
the battlefield. Who goes first? I'm going to say
Uncle Sam goes first, and he's going to start by

519
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:05,780
growing about six stories tall right off the bat,
and he's going to point to the X-Factor and say, I

520
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:13,700
want you to die. And so he's going to leap towards
them and land right on top of the group, just

521
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:20,080
stopping them all into the ground with his giant
feet. No, but Siren is going to shout out a sonic

522
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:26,900
blast at Uncle Sam as he's trying to land on them.
And the sonic force waves are going to make him fall

523
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:33,180
short in his leap, and he's just going to fall on his
ass instead. And then Havoc unloads a giant plasma

524
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:39,300
blast in Freedom Fighters direction that for sure
incinerates Uncle Sam, but also just

525
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:46,360
disintegrates the rest of the team. For sure. No.
Uncle Sam is basically invulnerable. So he may get

526
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:52,600
burned, but he's not going to disintegrate. In
fact, actually his body is going to act as a barrier

527
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:58,960
between both teams, and he's going to protect his
side from Havoc's energy. And from behind Uncle

528
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:06,760
Sam, the ray is just going to zip right into the sky
and rain lasers down upon X-Factor, which is going

529
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:13,080
to provide cover for the rest of his team to emerge
into the battle. Well, Polaris throws up an

530
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:18,100
electromagnetic shield that'll protect
X-Factor from the ray's lasers and also provide

531
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:24,320
that team with cover to go out into the battle. And
right away, Iceman rides over to Black Condor, and

532
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:28,980
he's going to be like, let's clip those wings, and
he's just going to perforate Black Condor's wings

533
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:35,200
with the volley of icicles, just turning the wings
into Swiss cheese. So now the dude can't even fly.

534
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:39,980
No, I'm going to say Black Condor totally saw
Iceman sliding toward him, because how could he

535
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:47,000
not? And he's going to counter these icicles with a
generated gust of wind that's strong enough to

536
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,560
redirect them toward, let's say, beast. And it's
going to attack him in his chest and in each of his

537
00:52:53,560 --> 00:53:00,540
limbs. Well, okay, so beast gets tagged with like
one or two of these icicles, but the damage is minor

538
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:06,520
at best. He also has quick enough reflexes to avoid
the rest of the ice spikes by flipping into the air.

539
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:12,660
And in fact, he catches one of the icicles, and he's
going to land on Uncle Sam's giant head and

540
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:17,840
probably make some quip about the sorry state of US
politics before just jamming the icicle right

541
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:24,100
into one of Uncle Sam's eyes. So now Uncle Sam has no
depth perception for the rest of this match. Well,

542
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:30,020
let's say Dull Man was on Uncle Sam when this
happened, just kind of hiding out. And he's

543
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:36,300
definitely too small for beast to notice. So
before beast can even land on Uncle Sam, Dull Man is

544
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:43,460
going to telekinetically stall beast in midair
and then hurl him really hard right into long

545
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:49,340
shots, sending both of them toppling across the
ground. Except that with long shots, good luck

546
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:56,200
power. He ducks out of the way just in time. So beast
misses hitting long shot and instead he rolls into

547
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:03,380
a ball that plows right into Phantom Lady, like a
furry 300 pound bowling ball. Okay. And he just

548
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:10,860
knocks her right the heck out. Except that Phantom
Lady was invisible and intangible at the time. So

549
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:16,660
no, actually he slams into multiple man. And
that's just going to send new versions of multiple

550
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:21,900
man scattered everywhere. Well, she's like an
impact of that magnitude would probably create

551
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:27,100
like 20 duplicates of multiple man
instantaneously. And I'm going to say that all 20

552
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:33,160
of these dupes are going to run over to the human
bomb and just start stomping his ass like they owe

553
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:40,140
him money. Human bomb. You clearly know nothing
about human bomb. You fucked up. I'm going to say as

554
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:46,600
these multiple men are attacking the human bomb,
he's going to pull off one of his gloves and just

555
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:53,780
punch one of them right in the shin, generating
this massive explosion that disrupts the entire

556
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:59,580
environment. Everyone just goes flying away from
the explosion and all of the multiple men

557
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:05,800
themselves, including the original, capture the
brunt of this explosion and get disintegrated.

558
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:11,120
You can't do that. No, that was way too quick for
multiple man. He didn't know what human bomb does.

559
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:17,500
How was multiple man supposed to know? He's going
to learn today. He just did. Okay, so multiple

560
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:25,120
man's out and the battlefield is a shallow crater.
Everyone's scattered. The dupes are dead and

561
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:31,620
everyone on X Factor is probably like, oh, shit, we
got to get rid of this human bomb guy. So I'm just

562
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:36,260
going to go out on a limb here and say that I think the
human bomb suit is made out of metal. Oh, no,

563
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:45,500
actually, it's a material called fibrowax. It's
like this non-metallic heat resistant material.

564
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:50,480
It's like the only thing he could touch that
doesn't explode because it's chemically inert.

565
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:58,080
Fucking course it is. Well, then Iceman freezes
human bomb. So now he's just frozen in this big ice

566
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:05,660
cube and Siren lets out a sonic cry that shatters
the ice cube and human bomb to pieces. So he's out of

567
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:11,940
this match now. No more threat from him.
Meanwhile, Havoc fires a plasma wave at Plastic

568
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:17,520
Man that just melts him into a plastic puddle.
Okay, well, Plastic Man, of course, is going to be

569
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:22,900
super extra about it. He's going to transform to
look like the Wicked Witch of the West. He's going

570
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:29,420
to be like, I'm melting. I'm melting. And that's
going to get the attention of Black Condor, who is

571
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:34,820
just going to dive bomb Havoc and knock him onto the
ground, which is going to give Plastic Man just

572
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:42,700
enough time to spring into the air and turn into
this small house that lands on Havoc crushing his

573
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:49,800
body with only his legs poking out from beneath the
foundation. So Havoc's dead. Why all the Wizard of

574
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:55,880
Oz references? I don't know. Plastic Man just
watched the movie. It was tough to mine. Okay,

575
00:56:55,880 --> 00:57:03,400
well, Polaris would be upset by Havoc's death.
She's angry and she's so angry that she emits a

576
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:10,240
electromagnetic wave that fries all the tech on
the battlefield. So that would include Phantom

577
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:16,360
Lady's tech, right? And whoever else uses tech.
And at the very least, I think the EMP would make Ray

578
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:20,700
puke his guts or something. Oh, right. Because
he's sensitive to electromagnetic energy.

579
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:28,420
Maybe, maybe. But yeah, Phantom Lady really is the
only one on the team who uses tech. It would disrupt

580
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:34,000
her Black Light technology that gives her her
powers. So, you know, she's probably not

581
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:40,020
invisible or intangible anymore. Good. Because
that's when Beast leaps over to her and lands like

582
00:57:40,020 --> 00:57:46,780
this 25 hit combo. Just like a cartwheel kick
followed by like a breakdance windmill move and

583
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:52,740
like a capoeira butterfly kick thing. Phantom
Lady is just getting hit like, uh, and then, you

584
00:57:52,740 --> 00:58:00,460
know, she's dead. Wow. Okay. Meanwhile, Polaris,
she's suddenly going to get wrapped up in a giant

585
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:07,200
Plastic Man burrito. Like literally it's a giant
tortilla with goggles. And in her panic while

586
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:14,640
trying to get out, she's going to quickly use up all
of her air and suffocate. So, she's out. A burrito

587
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:20,440
is a weird way to go out. But I'm going to say this is a
frozen burrito because Iceman just froze Plastic

588
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:26,820
Man and Plastic Man's out of the match because Ice
is his weakness. But Iceman grows into a giant form

589
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:32,420
like an Ice Giant about the same size as Uncle Sam.
And he's going to grab this frozen Plastic Man

590
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:38,200
burrito and just slap it across the face of Uncle
Sam. So Plastic Man shatters and Uncle Sam just got

591
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:46,200
walloped in the face. Okay. So you literally awoke
a sleeping giant. Bad move because while Iceman is

592
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:54,380
distracted by treading blows with Uncle Sam, Rey
is going to just bombard Iceman from above with

593
00:58:54,380 --> 00:59:00,700
heat waves. That's going to melt him and evaporate
him simultaneously so that Iceman becomes

594
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:09,760
non-existent, basically. Okay. But Beast, after
beating the crap out of Phantom Lady, he used his

595
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:15,880
ingenuity to get her Black Light technology
working again because he studied it and he's smart

596
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:22,620
like that. And he's going to use her Black Light
technology to emit a Black Light hologram that

597
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:27,220
he's going to shoot at the Rey, which is going to
encase the Rey in darkness and just erase him from

598
00:59:27,220 --> 00:59:34,900
this match. Interesting. Okay. Science. That was
a good move, actually. But suddenly, Uncle Sam's

599
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:42,140
giant top hat is going to slam down over Beast and
when he lifts it back up, Beast is gone because he

600
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:47,860
was banished to the Heartland dimension by Uncle
Sam, who used his hat like a portal. What is he? Some

601
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:55,040
kind of stage magician? Sure. Instead of pulling a
rabbit out of a hat, he puts a beast into it. But then

602
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:03,260
all of a sudden, Uncle Sam's head explodes. What?
And Dollman crawls out of it. Why? Because Siren

603
01:00:03,260 --> 01:00:10,980
used her hypnotizing Siren song to lure Dollman
into going into Uncle Sam's head and then blowing

604
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:18,580
it up with a mental blast. Dang. Well, with the
death of Uncle Sam, the leader of the team, Black

605
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:26,800
Condor is going to fly literal around Siren,
trapping her in a tornado that's also going to suck

606
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:31,960
the air away from her. And that's going to prevent
her from using her sound powers while also

607
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:38,780
simultaneously knocking her unconscious from
the lack of oxygen. So Siren's out. But then all of a

608
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:46,060
sudden, Black Condor falls out of the sky because
he got a throwing blade to the face. And yeah, he's

609
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:52,820
high up in the air, but Longshot threw the blade and
Longshot's aim is lucky like that, which means

610
01:00:52,820 --> 01:01:01,700
that the battle is down to Longshot and Dollman.
Oh, shit. OK, Dollman, he's a master of stealth

611
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:06,540
operations. So he's just going to use the
environment and like all of the bodies strewn

612
01:01:06,540 --> 01:01:12,840
about to hide from Longshot. And he's going to wait
until Longshot just stumbles right over him. And

613
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:17,800
that's when Dollman is going to do a leaping
uppercut right to Longshot's abdomen, just

614
01:01:17,800 --> 01:01:24,040
knocking the wind out of him. And with Longshot on
his knees, trying to breathe, that's when Dollman

615
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:30,320
is going to deliver a knockout punch right to
Longshot's temple, knocking him out. So Dollman

616
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:37,140
is like leaping around doing all this punching.
Yeah. OK. Well, when Dollman first makes contact

617
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:42,660
when he knocks the wind out of Longshot, that's
when Longshot got a glimpse of Dollman's future

618
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:48,580
using his psychometry. So Longshot knows that the
second blow to his head is coming while he's

619
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:54,340
kneeling. So instead of landing that shot,
Dollman just jumps into a knife that Longshot

620
01:01:54,340 --> 01:02:02,420
threw and the match is over. Nah, because Dollman,
he's really agile for his size. And so as the knife

621
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:09,180
is coming at him, Dollman's just going to freeze it
midair, jump onto the blade like he's surfing it,

622
01:02:09,180 --> 01:02:15,460
and he's going to ride it as he telekinetically
hurls it right into Longshot's own neck. Yeah, he

623
01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:20,880
meant to do that, but he mistimed everything and
then got cleaved into by the knife. Caused, of

624
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:26,860
course, by Longshot's probability
manipulation. That's dumb. That's also probably

625
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:33,660
a good place to leave the match. Either Dollman
uses Longshot's own blade against him or Dollman

626
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:39,360
just has bad luck and ends up getting cleaved into.
Let's go ahead and put the team members statistics

627
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:47,140
into our simulator, run the sims, and come back
with the winner. A.J .9K, hit it! Inputting data,

628
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:52,680
running calculations, processing results,
simulations complete. What'd you think of this

629
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:57,300
episode? I thought it was pretty fun. I liked the
rosters on both teams. They're definitely really

630
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:02,520
cool characters. Like I mentioned earlier that
Multiple Man had a cool power set, but so does like

631
01:03:02,520 --> 01:03:08,420
the human bomb and Phantom Lady and Rey and really
all of the members of the Freedom Fighters. Yeah,

632
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:14,800
it was really fun to pair those characters against
X Factor. In order to maintain like, a semblance of

633
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:20,680
fairness between these rosters, we like to pair up
each of the characters. So in this instance, we

634
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:27,640
went with Rey and Iceman, Plastic Man and Multiple
Man, Dollman and Longshot, Black Condor and

635
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:34,960
Siren, Phantom Lady and Polaris, Human Bomb and
Havoc, and Uncle Sam and Beast. I thought those

636
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:40,180
were pretty damn good pairings. Yeah, a few of
those would have made fantastic individual dual

637
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:45,100
episodes. Inputting the team statistics, it
looks like the biggest differences between the

638
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:51,060
teams were in the categories of durability and
perception, with the Freedom Fighters being way

639
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:57,480
more durable, like shockingly more durable than X
Factor. As compared to some of DC's characters

640
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:04,160
like Plastic Man, Uncle Sam, Human Bomb, who all
have increased durability. Yeah, the Rey can

641
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:09,100
regenerate and stuff like that. My most durable
character was Iceman, who could also regenerate.

642
01:04:09,100 --> 01:04:14,240
But we had decent evasiveness like Polaris has her
force fields, Longshot has his probability

643
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:19,720
manipulation, and Iceman also has shielding. We
did say that the X Factor team was much more

644
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:25,660
versatile. A lot of the Freedom Fighter members
are kind of one-trick ponies. I think another

645
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:30,840
category that sticks out is range. A lot of the X
Factor guys have some sort of ranged attack,

646
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:36,400
except for Beast. Now, I definitely had the most
powerful character on both teams in the Rey,

647
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:41,100
surprisingly. No, he wasn't the most powerful. He
actually tied with Polaris, who was also very

648
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:47,080
powerful and the most powerful on X Factor,
stat-wise. But X Factor had the weakest members

649
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:53,040
out of both teams in Siren and Havoc, which is
shocking to say because they're both pretty

650
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:59,240
powerful characters. So I think that just goes to
show that both teams have really solid rosters. So

651
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:04,540
with all of this said, Joseph, which team do you
think came out on top? I think it's going to be X

652
01:05:04,540 --> 01:05:12,160
Factor. And Instagram agrees with me, because 61%
of our followers who took part in our poll said that

653
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:17,120
X Factor would win. And I think the win rate's going
to be right around there. I feel like anytime you

654
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:23,060
pit an X-Men team against any other team, people
are going to vote for the X-Men team. They're just,

655
01:05:23,060 --> 01:05:30,920
yeah, more popular. As they should. But are they
right? Let's find out. AJ9K, the results please.

656
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:39,180
Hey, you are, sir. The winner in the team duel
matchup between Freedom Fighters and X Factor

657
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:49,720
is... Freedom Fighters! Bish! How the hell did
that happen? By how much? Freedom Fighters won

658
01:05:49,720 --> 01:05:59,700
56.2% of the simulated matches compared to X
Factor's 43.8. So it was close, but not that close,

659
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:06,520
I guess. You thought X Factor was going to beat
Freedom Fighters by 61%. Yeah. What? Why not?

660
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:11,760
Because they're not that good, bro. I was
initially thinking about having Quicksilver on

661
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:18,480
this team duel, and I wonder if maybe I should have
replaced Longshot or Siren with Quicksilver, who

662
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:22,960
may have been more statistically impressive. I
was thinking about that when you were listing all

663
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:28,440
the different characters that were on the team,
and I was like, oh, Quicksilver, why was he not on

664
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:32,620
this roster? Not that it would have made a
difference. It probably wouldn't have made a

665
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:36,880
difference. I think I still would have lost,
because even Quicksilver is not that much

666
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:42,420
statistically better than Longshot or Siren or
Havoc. Freedom Fighters, I guess, is just a team

667
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:48,060
composed of cheater characters who are way too
powerful for their own good. Just vague and

668
01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:53,640
powerful. That's all DC has. I mean, they didn't
even start on DC. They were quality comics

669
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:59,220
characters that DC acquired. Well, they acquired
them because the characters were vague and super

670
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:06,580
powerful. And winners, unlike your team, of
losers. Now, actually, the losers are a DC team as

671
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:14,340
well. Oh, yeah, that's fair. That's true. But that
does it for this duel. AJ9K help close us out.
