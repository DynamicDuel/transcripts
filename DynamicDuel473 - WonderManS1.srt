00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,480
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi, welcome
back to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a Rotten

2
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,320
Tomatoes-approved show that reviews superhero
films and series through the lens of the DC and

3
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:32,280
Marvel fandoms. I'm Jonathan. You're not Johnny
DC anymore? Heck no, I'm so sick and tired of

4
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:41,160
calling you Marvelous Joe. Okay, I'm Joseph. If
people haven't figured out that Jonathan is Team

5
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,560
DC and Joseph is Team Marvel after 10 years, I don't
know what to tell them. Well, maybe people are

6
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,120
listening to the show for the first time with this
episode. They're going to want to know things

7
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,800
like, I'm your twin brother and we had a show where
we pit Marvel and DC characters going up against

8
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,300
each other for 10 years and then we retired that
show and that we're bringing it back as a monthly

9
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:08,920
podcast reviewing Marvel and DC projects. Yeah,
it's been just over a month since we reached this

10
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:15,200
semi-retired phase. I got to say, I really missed
it. It's hard to get back into this now. I feel like

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,740
I'm so out of practice. I don't even know what a
podcast is anymore. But thank you to our listeners

12
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,280
for sticking with us as we transition into this new
phase. In this episode, we're going to be

13
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:32,240
reviewing season one of Wonder Man. Jonathan, did
you watch it? I tried to. I think I got a little bit

14
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,580
more than halfway through the first episode.
Well, that's okay that you didn't watch it because

15
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:41,020
we're going to be doing non-spoiler reviews from
here on out. Those of you who are used to listening

16
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:46,220
to our earlier reviews, you know that we typically
dive deep into the plot and we break down basically

17
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:52,340
everything that happens and discuss spoilers.
But in this brand new era of dynamic dual, we're

18
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:56,580
going to be taking a more traditional approach to
our film and TV criticism in that we're not going to

19
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,960
be doing full story breakdowns. We're not going to
be discussing anything that would be considered a

20
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,920
spoiler, hopefully. Instead, these reviews are
going to serve more as an overview of our thoughts

21
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:12,240
on the project and whether or not we as longtime
Marvel and DC fans would recommend it. I think our

22
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,480
new aim here is really to provide that superfan
perspective among the whole sea of other types of

23
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,760
film and TV critics who may or may not have
familiarity with these characters. So our

24
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:27,780
format's changing a little bit. Hopefully you
still enjoy it. But first real quick, our

25
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:34,360
artificially intelligent co-host, AJ9K, is also
backing you as a quick message for our listeners.

26
00:02:34,360 --> 00:03:16,240
So listen up. Thanks, AJ9K. Before we get into the
review, since this is a Marvel and DC review

27
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:21,060
podcast, one of the new things that we'll be doing
is going over the comic book characters that

28
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,340
appear within the projects that we're reviewing,
giving people a refresher or an introduction to

29
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:34,500
the source material, origins, and powers. This is
a new segment we're calling Who's Who. So let me go

30
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,100
over the comic book characters that appear in
Wonder Man Season 1, starting with Wonder Man. A

31
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:46,260
competitor to Tony Stark, Simon Williams was an
industrialist who lost his munitions company and

32
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:52,060
was imprisoned after being caught in bezeling
funds. Baron Zemo freed Simon from prison and

33
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:58,320
exposed him to ionic radiation, transforming him
into Wonder Man. He infiltrated the Avengers as a

34
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:03,400
mole for the Masters of Evil, but later had a change
of heart and ultimately sacrificed himself to

35
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:09,480
save his new heroic friends. Though believed
dead, Simon survived in a death-like coma and was

36
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,300
eventually revived. He rejoined the Avengers and
became a prominent member of the team. Simon later

37
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,680
co-founded their West Coast branch in Los
Angeles, where he also established a

38
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,920
semi-successful acting career. Powers-wise,
Wonder Man's ionic form grants him vast

39
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:29,360
superhuman strength, near-total
invulnerability to physical and energy attacks,

40
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:35,720
and flight. On rare occasions, he'll expel his
ionic energy in the form of eye blasts. You can

41
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,600
learn more about Wonder Man in his dual episode
against Captain Adam. Now, it was going to go into

42
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,740
the backstory of the Mandarin, but I don't think
that will be helpful to people watching Wonder

43
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:50,680
Man. The backstory of Trevor Slattery is more
important there, and Trevor is an original

44
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,700
character to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. So
let's dive into another character that appears in

45
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:02,820
Wonder Man Season 1, called Dorman. Damar Davis
was a mutant whose ex-gene granted him the ability

46
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:08,620
to act as a living doorway. Adopting the name
Dorman, he joined the unconventional and

47
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,220
unsanctioned Great Lakes Avengers, quickly
becoming the team's primary means of

48
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:19,460
transportation and tactical repositioning. By
merging his body with solid surfaces, Dorman can

49
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:25,140
go intangible and open a portal through himself,
allowing others to pass instantly from one side of

50
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:30,740
an object to another. You can also access the Dark
Force dimension using the realm as a conduit for

51
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:35,440
longer-range travel. We never did a duel with
Dorman, but you can learn more about the Dark Force

52
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,220
dimension in our Cloak and Dagger dual episode
where we pit the two characters against the Wonder

53
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:46,020
Twins. The final character that I'll get into in
Wonder Man Season 2 is called the Grim Reaper. This

54
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:50,900
is Eric Williams, who is the elder brother of
Simon, who refused to join their family munitions

55
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,420
business and instead joined the mob. When Simon
became Wonder Man and seemingly died saving the

56
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:02,200
Avengers, Eric blamed the team for his brother's
fate. Consumed by grief and instability, he

57
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,220
adopted the identity of the Grim Reaper,
outfitting himself with advanced tech. Eric

58
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:12,040
became obsessed with avenging Simon and later
fixated on the android Vision, whose mind was

59
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,960
patterned from his brother Simon's brainwaves.
He became a recurring enemy of the Avengers and

60
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,260
West Coast Avengers, although Simon eventually
returned to life. Eric's fractured psyche

61
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:26,500
prevented their reconciliation. The Grim Reaper
is an experienced hand combatant with a

62
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:32,180
cybernetic arm ending in a scythe-like blade
capable of projecting energy blasts and whirling

63
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:38,040
as a shield or helicopter blade. He has a genius
level aptitude for electronics and robotics, and

64
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:44,080
after he died in battle once, he was resurrected as
a zombie-like being and gained the power of

65
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:51,040
Necromancy, able to reanimate the death. That is
Wonder Man's brother. We did not do a dual episode

66
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:56,480
with Grim Reaper, but if you guys come up with a good
idea on who he could have gone up against, go ahead

67
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,460
and let us know on our Discord, which is linked in
our show notes and maybe we'll run the stats on

68
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:09,900
them. Yeah, him or doorman. Now that you know all
about the comic book characters that appear in

69
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:29,360
this series, let's go ahead and get into our main
event, where we review Wonder Man Season 1.

70
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:35,380
Alright, Wonder Man Season 1 was released by
Marvel Television in January of 2026 on Disney

71
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:42,880
Plus. The series stars Yaya Abdul-Mateen II and
Sir Ben Kingsley. It's showrun by Andrew Guest and

72
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,940
was co-created by Shang-Chi and the upcoming
Spider-Man brand new day director, Dustin Daniel

73
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:53,320
Cretton. The series follows struggling actor
Simon Williams, who tries to land the role of

74
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:59,400
Wonder Man in a remake of the 1980 superhero film of
the same title. He learns about the role after

75
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,220
running into Trevor Slattery, an actor trying to
make a comeback after being imprisoned and

76
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,280
disgraced in Hollywood for impersonating a
terrorist known as the Mandarin. And of course

77
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,000
that happened in Iron Man 3 and we saw the fallout of
that event in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten

78
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,340
Rings. Simon and Trevor befriend each other in
their pursuit of the roles of Wonder Man and his

79
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:26,220
sidekick Barnaby, respectively, while Simon
struggles with the fact that his Ionic super

80
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:32,299
abilities make him ineligible for the role under
an industry wide ban on superpowered beings. Now

81
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:38,120
is Barnaby a character from the comics? No,
Barnaby is original to this particular series.

82
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:43,419
They needed something for Ben Kingsley's
character, Trevor Slattery, to try out for.

83
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:47,800
Obviously he couldn't be Wonder Man, they needed
somebody that was close to the character that

84
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:53,280
would be like a lead role that they were both going
for. So Barnaby is like Wonder Man's Alfred in this

85
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:58,080
series? Exactly, yes. All while this is
happening, Simon is under investigation by the

86
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,960
Department of Damage Control who is seeking to
arrest him for potentially harboring dangerous

87
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:10,200
powers. Now my biggest takeaway from the show is
that it is not anything like the comic book

88
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:15,460
character. It's not faithful in any way, it's not a
satisfying adaptation of Simon Williams from the

89
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:21,420
comic books. And in fact this might be one of the
poorest translations of the source material and

90
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,720
certainly Marvel televisions for this
departure, even more than like Moon Knight, which

91
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:32,840
was a pretty far departure. I might even label
Wonder Man season one as Wonder Man in name only.

92
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,980
Now if you're not a fan of the comic book character,
the fact that Simon Williams in this show is almost

93
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:43,860
nothing like his comic book counterpart isn't
going to mean anything to you. And if you are a fan,

94
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,640
I'm going to say that it's not going to mean
anything to you either. Because despite the fact

95
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:53,620
that we have a poor adaptation situation going on
here, what we also have I think is one of Marvel

96
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:58,840
Studios most interesting and approachable
experiments that they've ever produced. Yeah it

97
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,280
was shocking to see that this was produced under
the Marvel spotlight banner. I didn't realize

98
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:09,580
that until I started the first episode. Of course
Marvel's other spotlight series was Echo, but I

99
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:15,600
know spotlight is specifically used to highlight
projects that are tackling lesser known

100
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,820
characters or unconventional stories, I
believe. Well it's for projects that are more

101
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,780
standalone. I don't know what to think about the
Marvel spotlight banner as it pertains to this

102
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:32,060
particular series. But the lack of adherence to
the source material as a Marvel purist, it did

103
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,920
raise difficult questions for me about the trade
off between seeing faithful and exciting

104
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:43,100
interpretations of the characters that I know and
love and seeing quality projects in general, even

105
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,740
those perhaps entirely outside of the superhero
genre. Oftentimes when I'm watching something

106
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:54,420
that is being adapted for film in a way that
completely deviates from the source material, I

107
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,900
often find myself realizing different ways they
could have incorporated different elements from

108
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:05,100
the source material into the series or the film,
but just didn't. Maybe because they weren't

109
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,880
knowledgeable enough or I don't know, just missed
it. Which makes me respect it less. Well like let me

110
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:19,860
raise a quandary for you. Okay you're a DC fan.
That's the quandary. What? No, no. Okay, so take

111
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,980
the character of Booster Gold, who's not only a
superhero, but also a football player, right?

112
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:33,860
Now, what if DC Studios released a Booster Gold
show that was 95% not about him as a superhero and

113
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:39,220
rarely showed his powers, but was still one of the
better and more interesting sports shows that

114
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,880
you've ever seen? What do your opinion of the show
as an adaptation affect your judgment of the show

115
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,580
as a quality project? That's not the best example
because Michael Carter, Booster Gold, was not a

116
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,560
football player for very long. He was caught
making sports bets and of course became a janitor

117
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,140
in a superhero museum. That doesn't matter
because Wonder Man wasn't an actor for very long

118
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,720
either. Oh. You know, in bits and pieces here and
there. But the fact is that regardless of that,

119
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,100
because he has this history as a comic book
character as a football player, they decided to

120
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:15,340
make the entire show about that. I would hate that
because Booster Gold is not about football. He's

121
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:20,720
about time travel. Really Wonder Man, the comic
book character is not about acting, but yet they

122
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,160
made the entire show about that. I'll say this. I do
have issues with Wonder Man, but nearly all of

123
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,360
those issues stem from the series as an adaptation
and not as a show in itself. But I ask myself, what

124
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,080
does that mean? Does that mean I have to be like an
apologist for the comic fandom? I don't know. Like

125
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:42,280
really, I defer to your struggles, Jonathan, with
the Joker film. Like the first Joker film, Joaquin

126
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:48,260
Phoenix's Joker was really Joker in name only. The
movie evoked the best of Scorsese's films,

127
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:53,960
though. It also was not a superhero film. It's also
not a great example because it was tackling

128
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:59,640
something that we really had no prior knowledge
of, which was the origin of the Joker. In the

129
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:04,200
comics, it's sort of intentionally left
ambiguous. There's multiple versions, but we're

130
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:11,420
not quite sure which one is the real one. The Joker
film tried to sell us on a specific version. So I

131
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:18,080
guess maybe that's how you're approaching Wonder
Man. This is a very specific version. I guess all I

132
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,520
know is that the Joker film was good. Wonder Man
season one was good. And what I don't want to do is

133
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,140
make your mistake of coming down on a project for
not being what you expected and failing perhaps to

134
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:34,100
fully praise it for the transcendent project that
it was. I think in hindsight, you yourself would

135
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,960
have rated Joker the first Joker higher than the
four stars that you did. Yeah, maybe. Yeah, though

136
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:48,360
I rated it low not because it was a bad adaptation,
but because it was just disturbing. Right. Right.

137
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:52,820
The project as an adaptation didn't matter to you
was more about the story. Yeah. I don't want to get

138
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:57,440
too far into the weeds here because Wonder Man is
not Joker, but I'll say that Wonder Man did evoke

139
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,360
some other great Hollywood projects. Like I
watched it and found myself drawing comparisons

140
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:08,200
to films like Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,
Midnight Cowboy, or even dialogue heavy

141
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:14,440
two-handers like Before Sunrise. There is some
action in the series. Don't get me wrong, but I'd

142
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,260
say it's like less than two minutes total of
runtime in eight 30 minute episodes. Say no more.

143
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:26,320
It's pretty crazy. Say no more. I'm not watching
it. It is pretty crazy for a superhero project. And

144
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:30,620
I do wonder if people will find that appealing. I do
think people will need to check their

145
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,860
expectations going in and not necessarily expect
your standard Marvel fare, but really expect

146
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:40,420
something entirely different. Did you find
instances as you were watching where they could

147
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:46,020
have inserted more action? No. I feel pretty
organic. I think what Marvel Studios has in the

148
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:51,020
Wonder Man series is basically an attempt to
venture beyond the standard formulas, tropes and

149
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:57,500
plot beats of good versus evil superhero fare and
do something unique. I've come down on Marvel

150
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:02,820
projects for straying outside the comics in
previous reviews. I liked Moonlight, but I'm

151
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,840
convinced it would have been better as a crime
thriller. There was She-Hulk, which tried to be a

152
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:12,680
legal comedy, but failed as both a satire of
superhero tropes and as a legal procedural.

153
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:18,100
Wonder Man is definitely its own thing. I would
define it as an American buddy comedy. And it

154
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,400
succeeds at being that, which makes all the
difference in the world. You know, if something is

155
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:27,560
done well, it makes me forgive what it could have
been, or maybe what I would have wanted as a comic

156
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:34,240
book fan. There are three things that Wonder Man
gets exceptionally right. Probably more than

157
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,360
that, but I'm going to narrow it down to dialogue,
performance, and cinematography. Starting with

158
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:46,260
the former two, like, never in my wildest dreams
would I have ever imagined Yaya Abdul-Mateen and

159
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:52,200
Sir Ben Kingsley as a quintessential buddy
pairing. But I am convinced that their chemistry

160
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:57,760
is exactly why Yaya was cast. Now, Trevor Slattery
has always been an out-of-left-field gem of a role

161
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:04,540
for Ben Kingsley, and to see Yaya match him line for
line reminds me of just how incredible Yaya is as an

162
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,540
actor. Like I remember thinking back to his
amazing delivery in the HBO Watchmen series, that

163
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:15,740
bar scene that he had with Regina King, that was an
iconic scene. And like between that series and

164
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:22,120
Wonder Man now, I'm entirely convinced that Yaya
Abdul-Mateen II is one of the best actors of this

165
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:29,040
generation. Not only can he act, he can act about
acting in this series. It's so meta that it feels

166
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,460
like you're watching a real behind-the-scenes
process when you see him do his thing. He is good. He

167
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:39,920
is really good. And it's funny because I think I
first heard about him when he was cast for Black

168
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,280
Manta in Aquaman. I don't remember hearing about
him prior to that. Yeah, same. In the course of the

169
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:51,660
series, Yaya convincingly lays out the arc of a man
who was alone and emotionally isolated from the

170
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,100
world around him due to feeling different, and
begins piecing together through this newfound

171
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,860
friendship that he retreats into acting as a means
to have any sort of semblance of emotional

172
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:08,260
connection with the world around him. Yaya took
this insecure over-thinker character and made

173
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,619
him endearing, while also making him the perfect
partner to Kingsley's infinitely quirky and

174
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:18,300
charming Trevor Slattery. The two leads are so
good together, just in their acting, that they can

175
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:22,980
take something as mundane and simple as
discussing their favorite movie monologues and

176
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:28,020
make that worth watching. It's those personal
interactions that are so low stakes for a Marvel

177
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:33,540
project, but they're like some of the best parts
about the show. The more toned-down, personal

178
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:38,280
approach to the story is definitely reflected in
the look of the show. I don't think I've seen

179
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:44,040
another MCU project with this type of
cinematography, this very naturalistic style,

180
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:49,420
which serves to highlight that this is not only not
a superhero adventure with super saturated

181
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:54,880
visual effects, it makes it feel like a
documentary almost, like a day in the life of an

182
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,260
aspiring LA actor. It's really different, but it
works, and it makes you feel like you're watching

183
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:03,480
some kind of art house fair. What's really
interesting is that the naturalistic

184
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,720
cinematography makes it really fucking shocking
when on the very rare occasion that something does

185
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,020
go down. Like, I don't think this is a spoiler, but I
will say that Wonder Man has one of the most violent

186
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:21,880
single shots out of any Marvel Studios project,
and because of that documentary feel to it, I

187
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,400
remember my jaw dropping at the moment. Like it was
very real and uncomfortable. And I'm talking like

188
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:32,380
this is more violent than any of the playful
ultra-violent stuff in Deadpool and Wolverine. I

189
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:37,800
remember going like, what the fuck? I was
surprised to hear you say that you thought the

190
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,560
cinematography was good, just because I didn't
really notice the documentary style you're

191
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:47,560
alluding to. Oh really? It definitely looks
different than any other Marvel Studios project.

192
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:52,700
There's even an entire episode that's shot in
black and white. It's fucking gorgeous. It's in

193
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:58,780
the middle of the season. It was really done well.
Regarding the story of the season, I really have to

194
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:03,000
say it was so hard writing this review and
deviating from a spoiler format because I just

195
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,240
want to talk about everything that happens. But at
the end of each episode, there's a decent turn that

196
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,960
makes you want to watch the next one. And the series
plots along pretty nicely, even though not a whole

197
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,000
lot happens in a couple of episodes. Like this
could have been a six-episode season. But at least

198
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,060
nothing meanders for too long, like it would in an
hour-long episode show because each episode was

199
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:28,300
only about 30 minutes. At the end of the day, the
show is less about the plotting or having

200
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:32,520
characters reach the next goal or resolving any
single conflict. It's more about the

201
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:38,060
relationship between the lead characters. And
more so than any other project, the story is about

202
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:43,480
the journey. Not really the end. Although I will
say that the end will still leave you with a smile on

203
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,200
your face. And still gets me really excited for
what comes next for these characters. I think

204
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,220
we'll definitely need a season two, the way this
season ends before we see Wonder Man crossover

205
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:59,440
with any other MCU characters. I would really love
to see Wonder Man join the Avengers though at some

206
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,720
point. Even though it wouldn't be entirely
necessary for this version of the character, I

207
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,740
think it would be fascinating. Yeah, maybe
they'll have him decide to join the Avengers as

208
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:14,660
part of some study in Casper View for a role he wants
to audition for in playing Tony Stark or

209
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,940
something. Who knows? I don't know. There's your
Tony Stark connection. He seems like he'd be more

210
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:23,840
at home with the Thunderbolts team. Maybe that's
just commenting on the cinematography of the

211
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,400
series. But I guess the Thunderbolts aren't
really a team anymore. They are the Avengers. So

212
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,560
who knows? When the time comes for you to write your
first review in this non-spoiler format,

213
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,260
Jonathan, I know you're going to have a hard time.
There's so much more I want to discuss about what

214
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:41,560
happens here. The plot does raise some
interesting points regarding superhero ethics.

215
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,460
And you know how much I love discussing superhero
ethics. I think it would be an interesting

216
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:51,220
conversation as to whether or not Simon should
even be acting, but I can't really get into any of

217
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:56,680
that without getting into spoilers. Oh, because
with great power comes great responsibility? No,

218
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:01,540
not at all. Okay, that's not what I'm talking about
at all. It has more to do with the nature of his

219
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:07,460
powers, which are not really like how they are on
the comic books. But I do think that it's actually a

220
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:12,300
pretty cool interpretation. Ultimately, the
Wonder Man series I think is important for Marvel

221
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:18,560
Studios. It's a really interesting first review
out of the gate for our new podcast format in that

222
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:23,320
the show made me question my own inconsistencies
and my approach to criticism, which eventually

223
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:30,280
made me land on the revelation that faithfulness
matters to me. So one of the most important things

224
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:35,500
out there when it comes to my approach to these
reviews, but quality matters more. I think at the

225
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:41,560
end of the day, I'd rather see a really, really damn
good project like Wonder Man Season 1 over a

226
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:47,700
faithful one. That being said, faithfulness is
still important. Would you say that quality is

227
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:54,140
more important to the survival of the genre than
faithfulness? Because as a fan of the comics, I'm

228
00:21:54,140 --> 00:22:00,400
always like, just follow the comic book. It's
there. Just do that. Like panel for panel and you

229
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,280
can't go wrong because it's great. Right. But so
many Marvel and DC projects aren't as good or at

230
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:12,520
least as exciting as I feel like they used to be. So
yeah, I'm not sure what's going to save the genre.

231
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:17,920
Does Wonder Man save the genre in the way it kind of
promised to in the marketing? Does it beat

232
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:22,660
superhero fatigue? Was that a claim that it made in
the marketing that it would beat superhero

233
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:28,160
fatigue? Yeah, it was like, oh, yeah, this is the
answer to superhero fatigue. Yeah, I think so. I

234
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:34,100
would definitely say that I think an out of box
approach is necessary in this era of alleged

235
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:40,320
superhero fatigue. And that's exactly what
Wonder Man does. Like this series is the once upon a

236
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,960
time in Hollywood for Marvel Studios. Like no one
does meandering character exploration like

237
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,280
Quentin Tarantino. It isn't even until the third
act of once upon a time that you even realize, oh,

238
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:57,340
this is revisionist history on the Manson murder
of Sharon Tate. But even that ending is secondary

239
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:03,200
to the film's like meta industry commentary and
the personal relationship between the two lead

240
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,340
characters, Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt. And
that's the exact same thing with Wonder Man, I

241
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:13,960
think it's more about the relationship between
these two characters. There is a story in Wonder

242
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,580
Man Season One, but it's secondary. And that's
pretty unique, I think, which is fascinating

243
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:23,320
because I know there are films out there that don't
have too much story. They're essentially just

244
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:30,380
plot for you to say that a comic book project has no
story and is just plot kind of has me a little

245
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:37,020
intrigued, but also kind of has me a little
disgusted. I'll say that in all, though Wonder Man

246
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:43,420
Season One falters as a comic book adaptation, it
succeeds as a worthy and unique experiment in

247
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:48,900
dialogue driven chemistry fueled character
study and rating Wonder Man Season One four stars

248
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:55,780
out of five, a fresh rating on rotten tomatoes.
Well, now that we know whether or not you recommend

249
00:23:55,780 --> 00:24:02,400
the project, you probably give us a few spoilers.
How about some out of context spoilers? Sure. OK,

250
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:11,480
some out of context spoilers. In Wonder Man Season
One, you see Olaf enter another man. Also, you can

251
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:18,740
see the most shocking head explosion since the
movie Scanners, I think. And you'll learn about

252
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:26,500
Mandarin's Mandarin's. Take from that what you
will. I don't want to. I might go to dark places. All

253
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:33,040
in all, guys, that was a review of Wonder Man Season
One. AJ9K helped close this out. Thanks for

257
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,300
what else is coming down the pike that you're
looking forward to reviewing later on this year?

258
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,560
Well, for DC, our next project is Supergirl, but
that's not coming down until the summer.

259
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:04,700
Honestly, the thing I'm most looking forward to,
though, is Spider Noir. Oh, yeah, that looks

260
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,840
really good. The trailer came out for that. I will
not be watching it in color. I will absolutely be

261
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:14,020
watching it in black and white. Nicholas Cage
looks a little unhinged in it, but that doesn't

262
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:19,180
come out until May. I know that Daredevil, born
against season two, drops its first episodes in

263
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:24,140
March, but we probably won't get to that until
later when the entire series is out. That does it

264
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:29,040
for this episode. We will see you guys in March. We
don't know what we're going to review yet, so look

265
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:34,220
forward to that surprise next month. Yeah, it'll
probably be something DC. I'll find something.

266
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:40,300
Thanks guys for listening. Up, up and away. True
believers. Turns out I suck a fat sack at playing

267
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,160
the blues, so glad to be back, guys.
