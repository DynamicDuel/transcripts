00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,600
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi, welcome to
the DynaMic Duel Podcast, where we review

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,820
superhero films and debate the superiority
between Marvel and DC by comparing their

3
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:39,980
characters in stat-based battle simulations.
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother Marvelous

4
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:47,120
Joe. And welcome to the episode of all episodes,
the one where we finally determine which universe

5
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:53,300
would win against the other. DC vs Marvel. It's our
penultimate episode. That's right, there's only

6
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,760
one more episode after this one. Jonathan, this is
our last duel. How do you feel about that? It's

7
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:04,220
pretty bittersweet. I'm not going to lie, but I'm
also super stoked just for you to find out how bad

8
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:10,280
Marvel would actually lose in a battle with DC.
Well, to be fair, this isn't the entire Marvel

9
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:17,400
Universe against the entire DC Universe. This is
12 of its top main characters against DC's 12 top

10
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:24,160
main characters. Right, we're in 2026 now, and
this is the 30th anniversary of the DC vs Marvel

11
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:30,720
four-part comic mini series that came out in 1996.
That was highly influential to us growing up. And

12
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,960
to honor that, we're kind of taking the same
approach with this final duel. Joseph and I are

13
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,680
brothers, just like the red and blue brothers from
that mini series. We've picked 12 champions from

14
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,380
each of our respective worlds, and we're going to
pit them against each other full force. It is going

15
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,300
to be the team duel to end all team duels. Really
excited to share with you guys who I've picked for

16
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,540
my 12-person roster. Before we get into the duel,
though, we're going to break down the latest comic

17
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,480
book movie news to come out over the past few weeks,
including the Avengers Doomsday teasers, at

18
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:07,800
least the first three. And the news that Sebastian
Stan and Scarlett Johansson have joined the cast

19
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:12,900
of the Batman part two. As always, we list our
segment times in our episode description, so feel

20
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,740
free to check out the show notes if you want to skip
ahead to a particular topic. Our artificially

21
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:24,780
intelligent duel simulator, AJ9K, has a quick

notes to listen to all the shows in the DynaMic
Podcast Network. But with that out of the way for

41
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:11,400
the final time, on to the news. Right over the past
few weeks, we've gotten teaser trailers for the

42
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,760
upcoming Avengers Doomsday movie that's going to
be coming out in December of 2026. Now, allegedly,

43
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,000
the short little teasers, which are only like 30
seconds long, will be leading up to a more official

44
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,460
teaser, but I'm not sure when that's going to
happen. I was actually kind of hoping that Marvel

45
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,260
would drop that before the show ended, because I
would love to talk about it. Looks like that's not

46
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,760
going to happen. They might be saving the longer
teaser for maybe the Super Bowl or something. But

47
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:40,480
there have been three of these trailers released
so far, officially a fourth one was leaked, but I

48
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,860
don't necessarily want to discuss that one in case
anybody hasn't seen it. But the first 30 second

49
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:50,640
teaser was with Steve Rogers. The big huge reveal
there was that Chris Evans is returning as Steve

50
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,880
Rogers in Avengers Doomsday. That was pretty huge
news because he wasn't revealed on that chair

51
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,740
promo where they revealed all the cast member
names that were going to be within the movie. So

52
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:05,260
that was pretty cool. Turns out he has a kid with
Peggy. I don't know if that's going to be James

53
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:10,800
Rogers, who was the character that was in that
Marvel Next animated movie. I think that's the

54
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,420
most likely candidate for who that baby is going to
be. Yeah, you figure he would have to have been born

55
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:20,820
around the middle of the 20th century, right?
That's true, actually. I didn't even think about

56
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:26,200
that. He likely would have been born around the
1950s, 1960s at the latest. So yeah, he's going to

57
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,660
be substantially older by the time the events of
Avengers Doomsday takes place. If they even show

58
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,180
him in the current timeline, right? Like Steve
Rogers might be plucked out of the timeline where

59
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,480
his kid was born and he doesn't get to see him
anymore or something like that. Who knows? The

60
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:47,700
second 30 second teaser that we got involved Thor,
who prays to his father Odin for the strengths to

61
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:54,040
fight for his daughter, Love. As much as I don't
love the character of Love because the movie Love

62
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:00,540
and Thunder sucked, it is really, really nice to
get a more serious Thor back on the screen. A mature

63
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,700
Thor, which is wild because the Thor movies have
gotten pretty wacky and almost crude with the

64
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:11,140
humor. So it's definitely a different take that
the Russo's have on the character from what we've

65
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:17,000
seen in his solo films recently. For sure. Yeah.
Big breath of fresh air right there. The third

66
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,280
teaser is probably the one that actually got me
excited because it showcased the return of the

67
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:30,260
X-Men. We see an elderly Magneto and Professor X
playing chess in the dilapidated X mansion. At the

68
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:37,700
end, though, we see James Marsden as Cyclops going
full on 90s Cyclops X-Men. It's glorious. He's

69
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,600
shooting an optic blast to the sky. Everything's
red. I'm pumped that they're finally doing

70
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:49,600
Cyclops justice on the big screen. And to add to
that, it's James Marsden in the role who was really

71
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,160
given the short end of the stick in the previous
X-Men franchise. Good for him. The character is

72
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:00,100
getting his due and the actor is. Totally shows how
awesome it is to have Marvel properties with

73
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,020
Marvel Studios and that having some other studios
try and figure out the characters. Exactly.

74
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,480
Exactly. In addition to the next leaked teaser
that's come out, I think we're going to get one

75
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:14,380
other teaser allegedly with Doctor Doom. But who
knows, you know, the Internet has tons of rumors

76
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:20,180
these days. AI doesn't help because I've seen like
four different AI teasers of the leaked one that we

77
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:26,260
don't want to spoil. Just trying to find the actual
footage. It's bullshit. I'm getting major legacy

78
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:32,080
vibes from all of these teasers that we've seen
with Captain America's son, with Thor's

79
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:37,760
daughter. Yeah, for as final as Avengers Endgame
felt, this Avengers Doomsday movie seems even

80
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:44,960
more like the lid on an era after Secret War. Which
thank goodness, because everything pretty much

81
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,220
after Endgame feels like it hasn't really been
connected in a satisfying way. So if they can sort

82
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,760
of officially pass on the baton in a way that they
weren't able to earlier, I think that'll go a long

83
00:07:56,760 --> 00:08:02,100
way in mending relationships with a lot of fans.
For sure. Yeah, just tie everything back together

84
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:07,940
again. Can't wait for the movie to come out this
December. We will be reviewing it. In DC News, we

85
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:13,600
learned that Sebastian Stan and Scarlett
Johansson have been cast in the Batman Part Two

86
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:18,200
directed by Matt Reeves and starring Robert
Pattinson. Now, it's been confirmed that

87
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:25,560
Sebastian Stan is playing Harvey Dent, a.k .a.
potentially Two Face, though we are not yet sure

88
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:31,180
who Scarlett Johansson is playing. The current
rumors are that she will be playing Gilda Dent, who

89
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,980
played a major role in the long Halloween comic
book series by Jeff Lowe and Tim Sayle, which I did

90
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:43,720
not see coming. We've seen Harvey Dent a lot in a lot
of media. So I didn't think they were going to go

91
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:49,540
that route. But the fact that they cast Sebastian
Stan opposite Robert Pattinson, I think is a

92
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,160
really solid choice. So when you say that we've
seen Two Face and a lot of media, are you referring

93
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,500
to like Joker, Folie a Deux? I'm talking about
basically every single Batman onscreen

94
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:05,260
franchise from the Tim Burton films to the
Schumacher films to the Nolan films. He's pretty

95
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:11,280
much been everywhere. So I'm not sure how they
would do him in a new kind of way. But again, if

96
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:16,660
you're going to do it, yeah, cast Sebastian Stan.
No, I'm sorry. I don't accept this because

97
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:22,500
Sebastian Stan is the winter soldier and he always
will be. And Scarlett Johansson will always be

98
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:28,440
Black Widow. So keep your hands off shit that you
can't have DC. Now, Scarlett Johansson is

99
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,180
definitely not a Black Widow anymore. But
Sebastian Stan just freaking played Bucky in the

100
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:38,160
Thunderbolts film. He's still the winter
soldier. So the fact that he's playing double duty

101
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,920
might be a little confusing. But the fact that the
Batman Matt Reeves universe does not take place in

102
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:52,320
the DCU helps a little bit. Maybe maybe Bucky dies
in Avengers Doomsday. Good. What? Yeah, I hope he

103
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,400
does. Oh, you're such a piece of shit. Now, rumors
are, like you said, that Scarlett Johansson is

104
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,860
playing Harvey Dent's wife, but she only had
relevance within the Long Halloween storyline in

105
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:07,740
the comic books. But the first The Batman Movie was
already heavily influenced by the Long

106
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,740
Halloween. The Long Halloween is one of the best
Batman comics. I'm not surprised that it

107
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:18,600
continues to be a wellspring from which movie
creatives continue to draw from. I'm wondering if

108
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:25,640
this will be the story of Harvey Dent becoming two
face or they're just including him here as a way to

109
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:30,340
build up something that could be paid off, maybe in
a third film. The rumors are that part two will

110
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:36,960
focus heavily on Arkham Asylum. So my suspicion is
that Gilda will play into that somehow, which is

111
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:42,860
probably why insiders are saying her role is a
major one within the film. And here I was hoping for

112
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:47,400
Mr. Freeze. What was I thinking? Hey, I'm eager to
see anything from the Matt Reeves Batman

113
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:53,000
universe. Sign me up. Yeah, if the Penguin showed
us anything, it's that there's a lot to explore

114
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,840
here and it's all really fucking good. Now, it'll
be a while before we actually see the film. It's not

115
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:04,660
scheduled to come out until October 2027. So we
have over a year and a half to go. I'm sure it's going

116
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:10,760
to feel really long until then, but I'm sure it'll
be worth the wait more than Avengers Doomsday for

117
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:16,120
sure. People have been waiting way longer for this
Avengers sequel than they have for the Batman

118
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:29,140
sequel. So sorry, but you're done. I said what I
said. But now let's get to the Duel matchup 10 years

119
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:53,880
on the making and find out who is going to win in a 12
versus 12 matchup of DC versus Marvel. OK, guys, DC

120
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:02,020
versus Marvel. It was a four part mini series that
both comic publishers released in 1996. Joseph

121
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:08,720
and I collected it. We had the poster for it. We were
all about it. For the longest time, it was like the

122
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:15,620
de facto DC versus Marvel event in comics up until
J. L. A. Avengers. And really, those are the big

123
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:20,660
two. Yeah, at least when it comes to like universe
wide events, not just individual character

124
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:27,900
crossovers. Now, we loved that story because it
was so ambitious in the world building created

125
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:33,280
with the two brothers and the Amalgam universe,
where DC and Marvel characters were merged and

126
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:38,780
everything that came from that. We even named our
awards show that we do at the end of every year after

127
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:44,900
the brothers that represent the DC and Marvel
universes from this mini series in which each

128
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:50,240
brother chose champions, essentially the most
popular characters at the time to pay against each

129
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,740
other to decide which universe lived and which
universe died. And those matches were Superman

130
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:01,880
versus Hulk, Batman versus Captain America,
Wonder Woman versus Storm, Green Lantern versus

131
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,560
Silver Surfer, Flash versus Quicksilver,
Aquaman versus Namor the Submariner, Shazam

132
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:16,020
versus Thor, Catwoman versus Electra, Superboy
versus Spider-Man, Lobo versus Wolverine and

133
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:22,120
Robin versus Jubilee. Yes, some questionable
matchups there. Also some questionable results

134
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,940
due to the fact that about half of those matchups
were voted on by readers. So it was kind of a

135
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,820
popularity contest, which is not how things are
supposed to be done. As you know, on our podcast, we

136
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:36,900
use character stats to run simulations to find out
who would actually win. And today we are going to

137
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:43,420
set the record straight 30 years after the comic
debuted as to who would have actually won in those

138
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:48,020
matches. Yeah, we're going to reveal some of the
results now because the other ones still pertain

139
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:53,660
to our current matchup and we'll keep those a
surprise for the end of the show. First to explain

140
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:59,200
the methodology behind our duels, let's go to our
sentient Duel simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000.

141
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,500
AJ9K tell our listeners how you go about
determining a winner in our Duel matchups. Yes, of

142
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,560
course, sir. The way I determine a winner between
the two teams is by running 1000 Monte Carlo

143
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,800
simulations between every character on each team
using their statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation

144
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,480
is a probabilistic model used to determine
outcomes through random sampling. In this case, I

145
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,700
randomize the statistics along a normal
distribution as a way to simulate the many

146
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,680
variables that can occur during battle. The stat
parameters are based on the official Marvel power

147
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,960
grid from which the DC characters statistics are
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are

148
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:40,500
included such as range, damage potential,
versatility and perception in order to create a

149
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:45,840
more detailed and accurate simulation. The
results of the 49000 simulations provide a

150
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,860
percentage of wins for each character on both
teams. The team with the higher average win rate is

151
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,180
declared the victor as they have a higher
probability to win any given battle. In an

152
00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:00,440
equitable pairing, neither team should win 100%
of the matches. The comic book stories have shown

153
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,820
that there's even a way for Batman to defeat
Superman. So the confidence rate of my method

154
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,860
falls in line with the precedents that have been
established in the source material. My

155
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:13,460
mathematical simulations are without
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole

156
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:20,400
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K. Yeah,

157
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,980
let's kick things off with probably the most
confusing matchup to me from the 90s miniseries,

158
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:32,260
Spider-Man vs. Superboy. Now, I understand that
at the time, Spider-Man's clone saga was going on,

159
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:38,100
so they wanted to pit a clone against a clone. But of
all the clones you could have chosen, Superboy was

160
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:45,060
by far the weirdest. Now, in the comic, Spider-Man
beat Superboy. But according to our results,

161
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:52,820
Superboy would actually beat Spider-Man. 59.5%
of the time compared to Spider-Man's win rate of

162
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:59,280
40.5%. Yeah, no surprise there. That's a weird
matchup. In the Aquaman vs. Namor the Submariner

163
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:04,400
matchup, they actually got that result right.
Aquaman would defeat Namor as we actually have

164
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:10,220
previously confirmed in an earlier episode of
Dynamic Duel Aquaman vs. the Submariner. Aquaman

165
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:18,360
wins 60.7% of the time. We also confirmed that
Flash would defeat Quicksilver 76.9% of the time.

166
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,620
But in a matchup we haven't done, Lobo vs.
Wolverine, it looks like they got it wrong. Lobo

167
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:33,500
would actually stomp Wolverine 82.1% of the time
compared to Wolverine's win rate of 17.9%. How

168
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:39,780
does that feel, Joseph? Unsurprising. It was a bad
matchup. Also a bad matchup, Wonder Woman vs.

169
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:45,220
Storm. Wonder Woman actually beat Storm not the
other way around as it happened in the comic.

170
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:53,300
Wonder Woman has a win rate of 63.9% compared to
Storm with the win rate of 36.1%. In the matchup

171
00:16:53,300 --> 00:17:00,700
between Silver Surfer and Green Lantern, Silver
Surfer won in the comic and that's accurate. He's a

172
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:09,700
stat powerhouse who wins 67.8% of the time
compared to Green Lantern's 32.2% win rate. In the

173
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:14,640
comic, Electra defeated Catwoman, which we
determined would actually be the case with a win

174
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:23,260
rate of 67.7% compared to Catwoman's 32.3%. And
for the final result that we'll give from the

175
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:30,500
miniseries, Robin vs. Jubilee, they had that one
correct as well. Robin wins 75.2% of the time

176
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:38,040
compared to Jubilee's win rate of 24.8%. In the
comic, Marvel actually won a majority of the

177
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:43,160
matches, but it looks like statistically that
would not have been the case. Yeah, DC would have

178
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,940
won a majority of those matches. They just didn't
have a good pairings at the time for those

179
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:52,420
characters. I think we chose better pairings for
this particular Duel matchup. So forget that 30

180
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:57,140
year old miniseries. Let's talk about who the
brothers should have actually chose. Superman

181
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:02,900
and the Hulk, Batman and Captain America, Wonder
Woman and Captain Marvel, Green Lantern and

182
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:10,120
Scarlet Witch, the Flash and Spider-Man, Aquaman
and Black Panther, Blue Beetle and Iron Man,

183
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:16,480
Shazam and Thor, Hawkgirl and Wolverine, John
Constantine and Doctor Strange, Green Arrow and

184
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,860
Daredevil, and finally Harley Quinn and
Deadpool. That is how you do a versus roster for

185
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:29,960
both sides. Now, these are all matches that we have
not done in prior episodes. So we have no idea who is

186
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:36,340
going to win yet. The rosters we chose were decided
upon with help from our executive producers. From

187
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:41,560
a long list of characters on potential matches, we
thought these ones were the most interesting with

188
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:47,300
the best respect of rosters from each universe.
Now let's speculate on how one of the thousands of

189
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:51,820
simulated matches will go. Again, the winners
determined by simulations, not our speculation,

190
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:56,060
but it's fun to imagine how the fight could play
out. AJ and IK, what are the rules of our

191
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:01,840
speculation? Well, I should say there are no rules
other than the teams have no prior knowledge of the

192
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,180
other going into the fight. All they are aware of
starting out is that the other side is a threat that

193
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:12,660
needs to be eliminated. For the speculation, the
groups will begin approximately 50 meters apart

194
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:17,620
in a nondescript environment that will have no
bearing on the match itself, as no environmental

195
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:23,380
statistics are considered in my simulations. The
teams must earn victory on their own merit. All

196
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:29,740
right, then let's get into it. For the final
matchup ever, Team DC and Team Marvel meet on the

197
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:36,060
battlefield. Who goes first? Is it even a
question? I mean, the Flash. the Flash goes first.

198
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:41,260
Always. Always he goes first. And he's going to
start things off by speeding around the planet

199
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:47,700
like five times in less than a second, just
gathering mass and momentum to the level of nearly

200
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:55,080
a black hole before slamming his fist hard right
into the face of your side's biggest guy, the Hulk,

201
00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,600
which is going to send him Korean backward all
before your team can even blink. You think if he hit

202
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,660
him with near the mass of a black hole, he would do
more than just cream backward. I think the

203
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:09,420
infinite mass punch is kind of bullshit, right?
Because the speed force negates the laws of

204
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:14,600
physics. I'll grant you that it was a really,
really powerful punch, but all that's going to do

205
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:20,660
is piss the Hulk off. As the Hulk flies backward,
Dr. Strange recognizes through the Eye of

206
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:27,420
Agamotto that it was a speedster that hit the Hulk.
And so he's going to generate a magic spell called

207
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:33,300
the following flames of the Faltine, which is this
blue fireball that's just going to endlessly

208
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:38,960
chase the Flash until it eventually catches up
with him and engulfs him and burns him alive. So the

209
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,860
flash is going to have to be constantly running to
avoid the flame. And while that's happening, Thor

210
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:51,320
spins his hammer and hurls a whirlwind over toward
the DC guys that immediately grows into this

211
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,880
powerful tornado that picks them all up and
scatters them across the battlefield. Oh, it

212
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,880
doesn't hurt them. It just scatters them. Yeah. I
mean, like he keeps them from strategizing,

213
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,380
though, because they're not near each other
anymore. OK, that's fine. Harley Quinn, she's

214
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:11,060
probably like, wee. And we'll say she gets flung
toward Deadpool, who doesn't have time to react

215
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:17,300
before she just wallops him across the face with
her giant mallet. Her giant mallet. Deadpool is

216
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:24,340
like, what in the penis envy is this? And he's just
going to slice Harley Quinn's hammer in half with

217
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:29,840
one of his katanas. And then he's going to slash at
her again. Like, let's do this hot topic. My safe

218
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:36,840
word is chimichanga. All right. Harley, she's
going to dodge the swords and she'll drop like a

219
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:43,560
cupcake grenade that blows off one of Deadpool's
legs as she skates away, laughing. Meanwhile,

220
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:49,100
Green Lantern is going to trap Captain America in a
green rocket ship construct that's going to

221
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,820
launch him into space just right away, taking him
out of the match. What? And at the same time,

222
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,660
Aquaman is going to hurl his Trident at Scarlet
Witch impaling her. No, no, no. Scarlet Witch is

223
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:05,760
going to throw up a hex shield that's going to cause
the Trident to reflect off of her shield and fly

224
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,400
right into one of Hawkgirls' wings, which is
going to impale it and ground Hawkgirls so she

225
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,980
can't fly anymore. And then Scarlet Witch is going
to teleport up to Captain America's rocket ship

226
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:22,000
and bring him back down to the battlefield, saving
him. You do realize that Hawkgirls' wings are not

227
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,060
organic, right? Like they're made of anthmedal.
Actually, that's the same material that

228
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:31,880
Aquaman's Trident is. So it doesn't pierce her
wings. Actually, the Trident is just going to

229
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:37,320
ricochet off her wings and get lodged into the
ground beside her. So she'll pick that up and now

230
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:43,560
she's Duel-wielding two-anthmedal weapons with
Aquaman's Trident and her own mace. And she's just

231
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:49,620
going to combo strike Spider-Man like a stab,
bash, spin, slash stab, combo. No, but Spider-Man

232
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:55,280
has Spidey Sense, and that'll allow him to dodge
and flip and spin and avoid getting hit by Hawke

233
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:00,480
Girls' weapons. And while he's dodging, he's
going to shoot a couple of web strands at Aquaman

234
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:07,700
and use them to slingshot Aquaman right into Hawke
Girls. So they collide and get knocked down. And

235
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:13,740
while that's happening, Captain Marvel flies
over to Green Arrow and shoots an energy blast that

236
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:19,580
turns him into a smear on the ground. Except that
the blast is blocked by Wonder Woman, who, you

237
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:25,240
know, leaps in to protect Green Arrow with her
silver bracelets. And Green Arrow from behind

238
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,080
Wonder Woman is going to hit Captain Marvel with an
explosive arrow that's going to knock her out of

239
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:37,080
the air. OK. Meanwhile, Wolverine straight up
lunges and pounces on Constantine, pinning him to

240
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:43,280
the ground and stabbing him right through the gut
with his claws. OK, that'll hurt Constantine. But

241
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,520
as he curses at Wolverine from the floor, he's
going to take the cigarette that he was smoking

242
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:55,200
from his mouth and put it out right in Wolverine's
eye and then snap his finger. And Wolverine's

243
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,640
going to get engulfed in flames. So he's going to
leap off of Constantine just freaking out. And

244
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,600
Constantine is going to perform a quick healing
spell on his stab wounds so that he doesn't bleed

245
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:11,520
out. OK, so Wolverine's on fire, but Iron Man is
going to fly over to him and use extinguishers in

246
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,380
his suit to douse Wolverine. So Wolverine's
charred, but, you know, his healing factor will

247
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:22,280
kick in. Simultaneously, Iron Man is going to
shoot out a homing missile that locks onto Batman

248
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:27,920
and flies over to him and explodes him. There
Batman, he'll dive out of the way of the missile.

249
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:34,480
And, you know, as it like circles back toward him,
he's going to shoot out a bat flare as a decoy that

250
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,900
the missile will lock onto instead. And actually,
you know, he shoots that flare at Captain America

251
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:47,260
across the battlefield so the missile blows him
up. Captain America is like, oh, shit. And he holds

252
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:52,620
up his shields just in time to protect him from the
flare and the missile explosion. So he's on phase

253
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:58,080
and he's going to hurl his shield at Blue Beetle,
which is going to hit Blue Beetle like a

254
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,420
sledgehammer right into his back where the alien
scarab is fused to a spine. And that's going to

255
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:09,720
cause the scarab to short circuit. Yeah, Blue
Beetle, his scarab will probably sense the

256
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,480
approaching shield. So it's just going to snatch
you out of the air with his mechanical insect arms

257
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,100
that, you know, protrude from his back. So now you
just gave him a back shield. And while that

258
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:26,060
happened reflexively, he was actually shooting a
grapple line that is going to connect to Black

259
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:32,540
Panther. And it's a Taser grapple. So it just fries
the vibranium suit and stuns him. OK, Black

260
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:36,860
Panther would be stunned because vibranium
wouldn't protect him from an electrical attack.

261
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:42,120
But through being shocked, he musters the
strength and will power to sever the grapple line

262
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:47,400
with his claws. So that's just going to cut off the
flow of energy from Blue Beetle's suit. At that

263
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:54,100
point, Black Panther is going to hurl a volley of
energy daggers at Shazam that are going to stick in

264
00:25:54,100 --> 00:26:00,080
his cape and then explode with kinetic energy,
knocking Shazam to the ground. That would barely

265
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,860
faze Shazam. Meanwhile, Superman, he's going to
fly over to Daredevil and freeze him into an ice

266
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:14,640
block with his freeze breath. What? What? OK,
Daredevil's frozen. But Hulk is going to break

267
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,860
Daredevil out of the ice block before Daredevil
freezes through. And then Hulk is going to leap

268
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:26,100
like 20 stories into the air and then come down like
a meteor crashing into Wonder Woman, just

269
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:30,680
slamming her into this like Wonder Woman shaped
crater on the ground, shaking the entire

270
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:35,620
battlefield with his landing. OK, but Shazam sees
this and he's going to knock the Hulk away from

271
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:41,140
Wonder Woman with a lightning bolt so large and
powerful that it's going to fry the Hulk's skin to a

272
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:46,340
crisp. Big deal. He can heal from that. It'll just
take a few seconds. While that's happening,

273
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:51,220
Daredevil, fresh from being freed from the ice
block that he was in, you know, this whole time he's

274
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:55,960
been tracking the Flash with his radar sense.
What? And he knows that the Flash is trying to

275
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:02,240
outrun the fireball that Dr. Strange created and
with perfect timing, Daredevil fires his billy

276
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:10,020
club out and trips the Flash up, who then falls,
gets caught by the fireball and burns alive. OK,

277
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:16,380
except that the Flash trips and falls into Iron
Man, or through him because he phases through him

278
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:21,420
and that's going to cause the fireball to collide
with Iron Man and just melt his armor. No, no, no,

279
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:26,880
no, that would happen. The following flames of the
Faltine are magic. They're homing. They would

280
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:32,780
actually go around Iron Man and still burn the
flash up while he was on the ground. That shit. Or

281
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:38,680
well, Constantine, he could use his trench coat,
which is fireproof, to smother the magic flames,

282
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:45,680
which he does before flinging that coat at
Daredevil and causing it to wrap around his face.

283
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:51,840
And since that coat is demonically possessed,
Daredevil becomes trapped in this illusion that

284
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:58,580
he's in hell. Meanwhile, as flash rapidly heals
from his burn wounds, Green Arrow is going to

285
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,960
straight up turn Wolverine into a pincushion full
of arrows. Yeah, that's not even going to slow

286
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:10,020
Wolverine down. It's just going to send him into a
berserker rage where he straight up eviscerates

287
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:16,080
Green Arrow, legit turning him into deli slices,
except that those arrows that Green Arrow shot

288
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,880
into him were taser arrows. And Green Arrow is
going to trigger them as Wolverine charges right

289
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:27,800
for him. So Wolverine gets electrocuted and now
he's down for the count. No, because Dr. Strange is

290
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:34,080
going to magically extract the electricity
flowing through Wolverine's skeleton and form it

291
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,400
into like a sort of Zeus's thunderbolt. And then
he's going to hurl it at Hock Girl with her metal

292
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:45,060
wings. And she's going to get zapped. Meanwhile,
Deadpool, his leg is now healed from being blown

293
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:50,740
off, he's gonna teleport behind Green Lantern and
straight up shoot him in the back of the head. He's

294
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:58,060
gonna be like, your movie sucked. Okay, but Batman
sees Green Lantern about to get shot and so he rolls

295
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:04,000
this sharp ass battering that lodges right into
Deadpool's wrist before he pulls the trigger. And

296
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:11,220
that's gonna sever all of the nerves to his hand.
Isn't he like, oh no my girlfriend! And with Green

297
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:17,840
Lantern now aware that Deadpool is behind him,
he's going to generate a giant green wrench and

298
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:23,020
just whack Deadpool. That's gonna send him
tumbling across the battlefield. Okay, well,

299
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:27,580
Spider-Man is gonna web up Harley Quinn, web up her
skates. We're just gonna make her a trip and eat

300
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:32,320
shit. She tries to curse him out like, fuck you,
pajama man, but he's gonna web her mouth shut and

301
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:38,320
she's actually gonna put her in like this web
cocoon, just web her all up. Meanwhile, Iron Man

302
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,140
fires a repulsor blast at Blue Beetle that knocks
Blue Beetle to the floor and knocks Captain

303
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:49,480
America's shield off of his back. Okay, Blue
Beetle would probably get hit, but you know, he

304
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:55,640
would set up a giant shield in front of him to block
any additional beams from Iron Man. And then he'll

305
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:01,700
transform that shield into like this massive
energy cannon that he'll use to fire a giant laser

306
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:08,080
beam like the size of a semi truck right back at Iron
Man. Knocking his ass into outer space. It would

307
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,400
never even hit him because Captain Marvel flew
into the laser's path and absorbed all of that

308
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:19,680
energy from Blue Beetle. So she's like pulsing
with cosmic energy now and she just unloads all of

309
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:27,080
that into Superman. So it's Superman's ass that
gets knocked into outer space, not Iron Man. Okay,

310
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:33,420
meanwhile Aquaman has his Trident back and he's
locked in with a battle with Thor who we'll say has

311
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:39,680
generated this massive storm and has hurling
lightning at Aquaman. But Aquaman, he's gonna

312
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:45,440
slam his Trident into the earth to ground the
lightning strikes and then pull it out and use its

313
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:51,700
magic to gather all of the rainwater from the storm
into a swirling pillar of water, a whirlpool

314
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:58,000
around Thor that's going to drown him. And Aquaman
can control water now? Well, I mean technically

315
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
yes, like he controls water in the comics even
without the Trident now. But I mean he's been able

316
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,020
to do that more or less with various Tridents for
some time in the comics. I guess I don't understand

317
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:16,500
what a whirlpool is gonna do to Thor because he can
simply fly out of the whirlpool because no

318
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:22,160
current's gonna be able to hold him. Meanwhile
Hulk is gonna punch the ground hard enough to

319
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:27,680
create a fissure in the earth that the Flash falls
into and then dies. Dude, you think Flash can't

320
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:33,580
outrun a fissure? Or like run up a fissure wall? You
know, he's gonna do just that and then run literal

321
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:39,460
circles around the Hulk, vacuuming the air out of
his lungs and causing him to transform into Bruce

322
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:46,320
Banner. And when Flash notices that this happens,
he's gonna pick Banner up and just drop him off on

323
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,900
the other side of the planet and leave him there
before running back to the battle. Meanwhile

324
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:56,940
Shazam and Captain Marvel are gonna be trading
blows mid-air, but the wisdom of Solomon tells

325
00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:02,780
Shazam that while she may have absorbed Blue
Beetle's energy attack, she probably can't

326
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:08,580
absorb magic. So that's when he summons this
massive bolt of living lightning that's gonna

327
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:13,720
crash Captain Marvel straight into the ground.
Okay, yeah, she can't absorb magic, that makes

328
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:20,660
sense, but Scarlet Witch is gonna fire a hex bolt at
Wonder Woman's lasso that's on her side causing it

329
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:26,700
to unravel and wrap around Wonder Woman and just
hog-tie her. And these knots are indestructible,

330
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:32,980
so Wonder Woman is powerless to escape her lasso.
Meanwhile, Black Panther leaps onto Hawkgirl's

331
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:39,660
back and uses his anti-metal claws to tear her
metal wings right off. She crashes into the ground

332
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:46,140
and probably tries to hit Black Panther with her
mace, which she does, but Black Panther absorbs

333
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:52,100
the blow of that with his Vibranium suit. So he gets
knocked away, but he's like vibrating with all of

334
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:58,660
this kinetic energy now. I don't think anti-metal
would break down like common Earth metals, so

335
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:04,780
while Black Panther sure does cause Hawkgirl to
crash to the ground from slashing her back, I'm

336
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:09,920
gonna say her wings remain intact, and Black
Panther, yeah, he's still knocked away by her mace

337
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:16,280
strike. But while that happened, Superman is
gonna swoop back to the battle from outer space and

338
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:22,820
he's just gonna rain down heat vision onto Captain
America who does not have a shield. No, he has a

339
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:28,660
shield. He got it back when it was knocked away from
Blue Beetle when Iron Man blasted him. So Captain

340
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:34,440
America uses the shield to block Superman's heat
vision and actually it reflects off of Captain

341
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:41,100
America's shield, hitting Aquaman, who burns and
gets dehydrated from the heat. Then Captain

342
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:45,820
America runs over to Daredevil and yanks
Constantine's coat off of his face, which pulls

343
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:51,660
him out of the Hell illusion. And now Free,
Daredevil flips over to Batman, dodging all of

344
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:58,040
Batman's strikes, and he wraps his Billy Club
cable around Batman's neck and just garots him.

345
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:02,580
Okay, well you know what, Daredevil didn't see
coming though? He doesn't see anything coming.

346
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:08,880
Exactly. But especially Harley Quinn's chaotic
tendency to show up just out of nowhere. Because

347
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:14,500
after getting out of Spider-Man's webbing with an
acid pellet, she's gonna load a stink bomb round

348
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,960
into her pop gun and fire that at Daredevil. And
that's gonna overload his senses with a smell

349
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:26,940
worse than hell. Allowing Batman to get free. And
while Daredevil is distracted, Harley Quinn's

350
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:33,219
gonna follow up with another round, this time a 9mm
one, which she's gonna use to send him to heaven. So

351
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:38,100
Daredevil's out? Yes, and meanwhile, Wonder
Woman, you know, she's been shimmying back and

352
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:43,300
forth while wrapped in her lasso, and that's gonna
give her enough slack to clap her bracelets

353
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:49,239
together. And that's gonna emit enough force to
cause a gap in the wrapping that allows Wonder

354
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:55,060
Woman to free herself. And now that she's free,
she's gonna lasso Captain Marvel by the neck and

355
00:34:55,060 --> 00:35:00,800
just yank her toward her, slamming her fist right
into Captain Marvel's face, just to link her out

356
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,420
cold. Okay, but right before Wonder Woman's fist
makes contact with Captain Marvel, Captain

357
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:12,440
Marvel just explodes like an energy bomb, which is
gonna knock Wonder Woman away, and Captain

358
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:17,740
Marvel's gonna free herself from the lasso. While
that's happening, Captain America is going toe to

359
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:22,120
toe with Harley Quinn, and Harley Quinn just is not
gonna stand a chance in that fight. He's gonna

360
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:27,580
disarm all of her attacks and just knock her out
unconscious with his shield before she even has

361
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:33,640
anything funny to say. So Harley Quinn is now out of
the match. Okay, all right, well, Green Arrow and

362
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:39,240
Deadpool are gonna be battling, and Green Arrow is
gonna manage to fire several cheap shot boxing

363
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:46,000
glove arrows right at Deadpool's nut sack like it
was a speed bag. And while Deadpool's lying on the

364
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,700
ground wincing, that's when Green Arrow's gonna
pin his head to the floor with an adhesive arrow,

365
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:57,960
gluing it to the ground permanently so Deadpool's
also out. Okay, gluing his head to the ground with

366
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:04,000
an arrow through the brain? Yeah, that's pretty
clever. Okay, well, Doctor Strange uses the

367
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,540
Ayavaga Moto to find Bruce Banner on the other side
of the world, and he's gonna open a portal to bring

368
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:15,940
Hulk back into the battle. Okay, but the portal is
gonna be set up right above Hulk Girl, so Hulk drops

369
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,840
back into the fight, right onto Hulk Girl's back,
crashing her into the ground and smashing her to a

370
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:27,080
paste. Because he's like mega pissed right now, so
Hulk Girl's out of the match. Okay, all right, well

371
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:33,060
Flash, he's going to disarm Captain America, just
straight up take a shield from him, which he then

372
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:39,120
uses as a battering gram, speed battering him from
like every angle until he's knocked unconscious

373
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:46,040
and is out of the match. Okay, well then Flash tries
that battering gram shit on Spider-Man, but

374
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:51,740
Spider-Man's Spidey sense warns him to hop out of
the way at the last second, and then he webs Flash's

375
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:57,660
feet to the ground as the Flash is speeding by and
that sudden stop and momentum is gonna break the

376
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:04,300
Flash's ankle, completely hobbles him like he's
James Caan in misery. Geez. And then Spidey is

377
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:09,280
gonna flip drop heel kick Flash right in the head,
which is gonna completely knock the Flash out of

378
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:15,320
the match. That's messed up, but meanwhile
Constantine, he's, you know, using sigil shields

379
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:20,980
to ward off blasts from Captain Marvel, and he has
his coat back on, by the way, so he's gonna reach

380
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:27,100
into one of his coat pockets and pull out a flask,
which he hurls at her. And when Captain Marvel

381
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:32,680
blasts it out of the air, the flask actually
latches onto her energy, converting her into pure

382
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:39,300
light as it sucks her into the flask like a genie.
And once she's completely absorbed, he grabs it

383
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:43,900
out of the air, puts it back in its coat pocket, and
so she's out of the match. Oh, that was

384
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:50,820
interesting. Okay. Uh, well, speaking of Captain
Marvel being out, Scarlet Witch is gonna place a

385
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:57,340
psychic hex on Shazam, and that's gonna cause
Shazam to transform and de-age back into Billy

386
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:04,740
Batson, but the hex is like compounding. So Billy
continues de-aging until he's just a baby, and

387
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:11,200
then finally just a pair of microscopic
reproductive cells. So Shazam's out. Oh, look at

388
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,780
that. Scarlet Witch just got blown to smithereens
by a green tomahawk missile. Looks like Green

389
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:21,520
Lantern was sick of her shit. Black Panther is sick
of Green Arrow's shit. Not only does he sever the

390
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,260
line on Green Arrow's bow with his claws, which is
gonna render Green Arrow completely useless,

391
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:31,880
Black Panther is gonna follow up by releasing all
of that stored up kinetic energy he has in his

392
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:37,300
vibranium suit with a punch to Green Arrow's chest
that's just gonna shatter all of his ribs into

393
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:44,400
gravel. Alright, meanwhile, Aquaman, he's been
summoning a wellspring beneath him to rehydrate

394
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:51,240
him. And finally, like Old Faithful, this hot
geyser shoots out from beneath him, launching him

395
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:57,320
into the air, where he magically redirects the jet
stream onto Spider-Man, which is gonna pin him to

396
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:04,280
the ground before Aquaman lands right on top of him
and impaling him with his Trident. Wow, okay, Iron

397
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,740
Man didn't appreciate that. He saw that, and he
lets Aquaman know that he didn't appreciate it by

398
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:15,380
frying him with a beam of microwave energy that
evaporates all of the moisture in Aquaman's body

399
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:21,580
until he's fully cooked and now dead. Alright, you
know what? Superman, he's gonna grab Hulk with his

400
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:27,740
super speed, fly him straight into space, and just
hurl him towards the sun, harden fast enough that

401
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:34,520
Doctor Strange doesn't have time to magically
teleport him back. Now what? Wolverine is gonna be

402
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:41,280
fighting against Batman at that time, and Batman
gets taken out of the match by some claws that go

403
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:46,680
right through his skull, because plot armor will
not protect him against Adamantium. Wait, what

404
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:52,120
the heck? You're taking out Batman like so
unceremoniously? Yeah, Wolverine doesn't give a

405
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:59,180
fuck. Well, okay, guess what? Wolverine, he's
suddenly gonna get yanked to the ground by Blue

406
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:05,280
Beetle, who then pins his neck and wrist to the
ground with a few rounds from a giant blue staple

407
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:10,860
gun, essentially. And with Wolverine
immobilized, that's when Blue Beetle drops this

408
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:16,860
scarab-shaped grenade near him. That's gonna
generate a small nuclear blast that's gonna leave

409
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:25,380
only Wolverine's bones as Blue Beetle flies away.
Okay, but Thor is gonna finally settle the end of

410
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:31,020
our Justice League Avengers team duel, our first
team duel that we ever did. He's gonna channel his

411
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:38,600
supernatural godly energies into his hammer, and
he's gonna fire it from Mjolnir as a god blast that's

412
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:45,340
gonna punch a hole right through Superman, who is
vulnerable to magic. What? So, Thor's weakens

413
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:52,920
now, yes, but it was worth it because Superman is
out of this match. Okay, I thought he was gonna be my

414
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:59,960
last guy, not gonna lie. But when Thor does that,
that's suddenly when Mjolnir is gonna get snatched

415
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:06,420
by Wonder Woman's lasso. And so now she's Super
Asgardian Wonder Woman, and she's gonna lift the

416
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:11,880
hammer into the air and bring it down right on top of
the weakened Thor, taking him out of the match.

417
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:17,900
Come at me, bro. Okay, so Wonder Woman has Thor's
hammer, but Doctor Strange is gonna detach his

418
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:24,500
cloak of levitation and is gonna fly at Wonder
Woman, envelop her, and is gonna swallow her up

419
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:32,280
basically and teleport her to Asgard. Where Odin
sees this chick who killed his son and is wielding

420
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:38,900
Mjolnir now, Odin's gonna remove the hammer's
power and then just imprison Wonder Woman in their

421
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:45,860
dungeons. So Wonder Woman's out of the match. What
the hell? Alright, I was not expecting that, I will

422
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:53,340
admit. Uh-huh. But meanwhile, back to the battle,
Blue Beetle Scarab has analyzed the vibratory

423
00:41:53,340 --> 00:42:00,120
nature of Black Panther's suit and produces a
counter-frequency that Blue Beetle fires at him

424
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:07,120
from a sonic cannon, shattering the vibranium
suit like it was glass. And with T'Challa exposed,

425
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:12,120
that's when he's gonna get impaled by a giant blue
lance from Blue Beetle's arm. So now Black

426
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:18,420
Panther's out. Interesting move, but little did
you know Iron Man has slowly been hacking the Blue

427
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:25,240
Beetle suit using nanotech drones that are gonna
force the Scarab to destroy its host, basically

428
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:30,800
disintegrating Jaime Reyes from within. And then
the Scarab is gonna fly over to Iron Man, now

429
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:38,080
programmed to incorporate itself into Iron Man's
armor. So now Iron Man is Iron Beetle. And good luck

430
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:44,600
with that. Oh yeah, no problem. The Scarab Kajida
is rich alien technology, but it's been corrupted

431
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:50,640
by magic before. So that was actually stupid on
behalf of Iron Man because Constantine knows the

432
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:56,560
history of the Scarab, and so he's gonna recite a
self-destruct incantation that Iron Man can't

433
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:04,580
decode in time, so kaboom, Iron Man's out. Ah,
okay. Dr. Strange sees this, and he's gonna detect

434
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:11,780
the dark occult magic that's in Constantine, and
he's gonna trace that to all the demons that are in

435
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:18,500
hell that own a part of Constantine's soul. So Dr.
Strange is gonna use a little bit of dark magic to

436
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:25,280
summon these demons to the battlefield, or to each
rip Constantine to pieces and drag him to hell in

437
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:31,320
small bits. No, dang. That's like the worst way to
take out Constantine. Good. Well, I guess it's

438
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:37,820
down to Green Lantern and Dr. Strange. Here it is.
The last one standing, the duel to end all duels,

439
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:43,780
and Green Lantern is gonna be the one to quick draw
first. He's gonna point his ring at Dr. Strange,

440
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:50,120
trapping and freezing him in a giant Green
Lantern, like a power battery that's on Oa, which

441
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:56,720
has held entities like Parallax, and the Lantern
battery drains Dr. Strange of all of his magic

442
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:03,460
power. And Green Lantern is going to use it to power
his own ring with like star-heart magical energy,

443
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:09,680
and he's gonna be like, beware my power. Green
Lantern's light! And he's gonna snap his fingers,

444
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:17,300
and Dr. Strange just ceases to exist. End of match.
You're right. Yep. Yep. And then Dr. Strange wakes

445
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:23,340
up from his trance, recognizing that that was one
of the thousands of simulations where his marble

446
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:29,740
team didn't win. So with the compounded knowledge
of everything that his team needs to do to win, he's

447
00:44:29,740 --> 00:44:34,900
gonna confer with the rest of the Marvel heroes
outside of time, and then he's gonna rewind the

448
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:39,460
clock back to the start of the match with everyone
knowing exactly what they need to do to win

449
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:46,400
decisively and swiftly. And the DC guys just
fucking get annihilated. They're gonna be

450
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,500
thinking they suck so hard because they get
defeated so quickly, and even Batman's gonna be

451
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:58,380
like, what the hell? Before he dies. And Marvel
wins. Match over. In the ten years of this podcast,

00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:56,660
emerge victorious. Visit dynamicpodcasts.com,
where we settle the debate and settle the score.

458
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:01,080
Let's go ahead and find out which of these
scenarios happens. Either Green Lantern traps

459
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:07,380
Dr. Strange in a power battery, drains his magic,
and uses it to power up his ring and snap Dr. Strange

460
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:13,960
out of existence. Or Dr. Strange foresees that
happening, rewinds time, and uses the battle

461
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:18,840
information to help the Marvel heroes defeat the
DC side. Let's go ahead and input all the character

462
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:33,740
stats, run all the simulations, and find out who
wins. Marvel or DC. AJ9K? Hit it! Alright, I think

463
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:41,920
that felt sufficiently epic for our final ever
duel and team duel. This was a whole lot of math. It

464
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:46,460
took us a couple days to actually run all of these
simulations. There's a whole lot of data here, a

465
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:53,080
lot to pour into. To start off, the most powerful
guys from each side were Green Lantern and Dr.

466
00:46:53,080 --> 00:47:00,360
Strange. My weakest guy on Marvel was a tie between
Daredevil and Captain America, but the weakest

467
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:06,760
person overall on both teams was Harley Quinn.
Weakest statistically, I should say. Right.

468
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:11,280
Breaking it down by category, the biggest stat
discrepancy between the two teams overall was

469
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:17,100
intelligence. Marvel actually came out ahead in
that category because of people like Bruce

470
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:21,880
Banner, Spider-Man, T'Challa, Iron Man, and Dr.
Strange. We had a lot of intellectual

471
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:28,360
powerhouses, whereas DC mostly had Constantine,
Batman, and that's pretty much it. Yeah, that was

472
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:34,040
the biggest discrepancy, but DC also came out
pretty far ahead in terms of speed. Thanks to

473
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:40,560
characters like Flash, Shazam, Superman, Wonder
Woman, we were a lot faster than the Marvel guys.

474
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:45,540
And the DC team was a lot more versatile,
especially among characters like Green Lantern,

475
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:50,740
Blue Beetle, Constantine, Green Arrow, Batman.
They're all really well equipped. Marvel's side,

476
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:54,940
though, wasn't a slouch when it came to the
fighting skills stat. Characters like Captain

477
00:47:54,940 --> 00:48:01,040
America, Wolverine, Daredevil, Deadpool are all
really skilled in fighting. Yeah, compared to my

478
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,400
side where my best fighters were Batman, Wonder
Woman, and Green Arrow. And Hawkgirl was up there,

479
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,360
too. Let's break down the pairings individually.
In the matchup between Superman and the Hulk,

480
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:20,920
Superman won 75.3% of their matches. I'm not too
surprised by that, just because Superman is

481
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:25,760
arguably strong, if not stronger than the Hulk,
and has all the versatility of his other

482
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:31,800
Kryptonian powers. In the Batman vs. Captain
America pairing, also no surprise for me, Batman

483
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:39,520
won that 72.8% of the time. I guess the result there
isn't surprising for me, but the win rate for

484
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:45,120
Batman is surprising. In the end, Captain America
is just as good as a fighter as Batman, but can't

485
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:49,540
compete with Batman's versatility or
intelligence. That's what it came down to. In the

486
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:55,100
Wonder Woman vs. Captain Marvel fight, DC won
again, with Wonder Woman beating Captain Marvel

487
00:48:55,100 --> 00:49:01,680
56.2% of the time. This one was a little bit closer.
Captain Marvel just wasn't quite as durable or as

488
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:06,160
strong as Wonder Woman. Yeah, honestly, in
regards to this matchup, I was actually

489
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:10,140
surprised. I was thinking Captain Marvel was
going to come out ahead, but I was really happy to

490
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:16,920
see that Wonder Woman did. In the Green Lantern vs.
Scarlet Witch matchup, DC wins yet again, with

491
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:23,900
Green Lantern pulling off a 72.5% win rate over
Scarlet Witch, which I'm calling bullshit. The

492
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:29,280
problem is that Green Lanterns are just so
impressive statistically, because they have all

493
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:35,620
the powers, and Scarlet Witch, even though she's
almost maxed out in stats like damage level,

494
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:40,420
invasiveness and versatility, she was lacking in
other key areas like fighting skill,

495
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:46,180
intelligence, and durability. Right, so DC has
won all four matches so far, but that ended when we

496
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:52,820
picked Spider-Man against the Flash. I totally
thought the Flash was going to win this, but

497
00:49:52,820 --> 00:50:01,940
Spider-Man did. 54.3% of their 1000 matches.
Which, what? Yeah, for as fast as the Flash is,

498
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:07,400
Spider-Man is arguably a slightly better
fighter. He has a Spider sense which helps him, and

499
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:12,560
he's stronger. So that was a close matchup, but
Spider-Man did narrowly get the victory there. In

500
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:18,680
the Aquaman vs. Black Panther matchup,
unfortunately Aquaman won that one, winning

501
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:25,600
54.1% of the time over Black Panther. Again, that
was a pretty close one as well. It looks like

502
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:31,380
Nth Metal does win the war against Vibranium. I
don't know about that, but Aquaman did eke out a win

503
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:37,000
due to his strength stat. In the matchup between
Iron Man and Blue Beetle, Earth comes out ahead

504
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:47,140
against the aliens because Iron Man won 67.7% of
the matches compared to Blue Beetle's 32.3%. I'm

505
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:51,540
not surprised by that one. I will say that Blue
Beetle was a lot more statistically impressive

506
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:57,400
than I thought he would be against Iron Man. But
Iron Man still had a pretty damn high win rate, so it

507
00:50:57,400 --> 00:51:01,160
just goes to show that Iron Man is just way better
than Blue Beetle, largely due to his

508
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:05,460
intelligence. Yeah, Iron Man was one of your most
powerful characters, very impressive

509
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:12,280
statistically. In the Thor vs. Shazam fight, now
this is one of the fights that took place in the 90s

510
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:19,740
crossover, we can definitively say that Thor does
beat Shazam, 59.5% of the time. In the end, Shazam

511
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:24,500
was just a little bit too much of a one-trick pony,
with Thor being able to do everything that Shazam

512
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:33,780
could do, but even more. In our closest pairing,
Wolverine beat Hawkgirl 50.2% of the time.

513
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:39,860
Cointoss. Now this is kind of a throwback to our
Hawk Man vs. Wolverine duel episode. I'm really

514
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:45,000
glad we redid that though because if you listened
to that episode, the power set we used for Hawk Man

515
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:52,100
was very specific to the new 52 era and completely
outdated. They didn't have identical stats, Hawk

516
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:56,480
Girl was more evasive because she could fly and she
was stronger, but Wolverine was a better fighter

517
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:01,560
and more durable. They kind of evened each other
out, therefore, a Cointoss. In the matchup

518
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:09,380
between Doctor Strange and Constantine, Doctor
Strange won 73.8% of the time due to a variety of

519
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:13,440
stats. I think largely it just comes down to the
fact that Doctor Strange is a sorcerer, whereas

520
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,300
Constantine is an occultist, and therefore
things just come a little bit slower and harder for

521
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:23,340
him. But also Doctor Strange is a powerhouse
statistically. He has all the powers, he's super

522
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:28,600
smart. Right, again, your most powerful
character. In one of my favorite pairings, Green

523
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:37,740
Arrow vs Daredevil, I'm happy to say that Green
Arrow won 54.5% of the time, which I think means

524
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:43,560
that Bullseye would totally stop in a real matchup
against Daredevil. Out of all the matches so far,

525
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:47,960
this one pisses me off the most because I don't see
how Green Arrow would ever hit Daredevil. I guess

526
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:54,040
sometimes Bullseye does hit Daredevil in their
fights, but what really eaked Green Arrow over the

527
00:52:54,040 --> 00:53:00,240
top was his versatility. Daredevil just has his
Billy Club, and it doesn't have as good of a range as

528
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:07,220
Green Arrow's plethora of arrows. Eventually,
Green Arrow's going to tag him or choose some kind

529
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:11,860
of arrow that overwhelms his senses. It's
bullshit. In the final matchup, where we pit

530
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:18,420
Deadpool against Harley Quinn, I don't think this
is any surprise, Deadpool won 61.1% of the time.

531
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:24,480
Harley Quinn had a more varied arsenal with all of
her silly gadgets, but Deadpool's healing factor

532
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:29,140
was just second to none, unless you're Wolverine.
Or the Hulk. But I mean, like we said earlier,

533
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:34,460
Harley Quinn was my weakest character. She
actually did not come out ahead in a majority of her

534
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:43,060
matches. Now, tallying it all up, we had 12
matches, and surprisingly, we each had 6 wins. Yah

535
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:47,320
yah, really lucky with the Wolverine vs. Hulk girl
fight, because that was a coin toss, and if

536
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:54,040
Wolverine didn't win that one, the overall score
would have been DC7 Marvel 5. But, since we each won

537
00:53:54,040 --> 00:54:01,300
6 matches, I guess it's a tie for Marvel and DC. No,
no, no, no. We have the total wins for all of the

538
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:08,000
matches for all of these characters, so let's find
out who actually wins between everyone. AJ9K, the

539
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:22,220
results please. Hey, you are, sir. The winner of
the matchup between Team DC and Team Marvel is...

540
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:29,880
Team DC! Fuck you! Fuck you! This doesn't really
mean that DC would win, it just means that these

541
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:35,960
particular 12 characters would beat these
particular 12 Marvel characters. Hey, we chose

542
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:43,040
these characters as the 12 representatives of our
respective universe. We've never done a team

543
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:50,820
matchup with this many characters before. You
have to accept DC's victory. They won 51.4% of the

544
00:54:50,820 --> 00:55:01,960
total matches compared to Marvel who won 48.6%.
Sir, DC officially wins. DC is officially better,

545
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:10,200
and I officially demand an apology from you. After
nearly 40 years, vol of your bullshit, saying that

546
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:16,960
Marvel characters are better when clearly they
are inferior. First of all, you can go straight up

547
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:24,040
fuck yourself. Second of all, those results are a
coin toss. If DC only won 50.4% of the matches...

548
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:31,480
51.4%. Oh, well, it's still pretty close. Third of
all, go fuck yourself again, harder. And then

549
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:37,260
fourth of all, I think we should judge these
results based off of the number of individual

550
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:42,600
pairing wins, which is 6-to-6, which is a tie.
You're trying to get me to admit that Marvel loses

551
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:47,840
overall when really it was just a breakdown of
these 24 characters. Dude, what do you think this

552
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:54,100
podcast has been about for the past 10 years? Yes,
I'm trying to get you to admit that Marvel would

553
00:55:54,100 --> 00:56:00,520
lose. They did. Hashtag deal with it. Also
hashtag, give me an apology. What we're going to do

554
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:05,660
is actually tally up all the wins and losses for
Marvel and DC throughout the 10 years of this

555
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:12,400
podcast in our next episode to reveal the actual
true winner between these two universes. But

556
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,440
we'll save that for our final episode. And just a
general retrospective of the podcast over the

557
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:23,400
past decade. Yeah, join us for our final episode
next week as we say goodbye to you guys for now.

558
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:28,140
Right, again, the podcast isn't going away
completely. We're just ending the weekly show.

559
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:34,980
We're ending the duels and switching to
exclusively a review focused show. AJ9K, help

560
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:58,540
close this out. Thanks to everyone for tuning into
this penultimate episode. Again, if you haven't

561
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:04,760
left us a voicemail, please visit our website at
dynamicduel.com to do so. Yeah, click the red

562
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:09,780
microphone button. We'd love to hear from you guys
and say our goodbyes. Thanks to everyone who's

563
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:15,040
helped to make this podcast possible. And we'll
talk to you guys next week up up and away. True

564
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:20,280
believers. Oh, so no more duels from here on out,
huh? Thanks, guys. I guess I'll just go fuck

565
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:20,280
myself.
