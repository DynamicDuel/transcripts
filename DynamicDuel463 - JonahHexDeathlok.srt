7
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,140
welcome to the DynaMic Duel Podcast, a weekly show
where we review superhero films and debate the

8
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,540
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters and stat-based battle

9
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:17,320
simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe and I'm his twin
brother, Johnny DC. And in this episode, we're

10
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:24,200
going to find out who would win in a fight between
the cowboy character of Jonah Hex and the zombie

11
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:30,600
cyborg character of Deathlock. Everybody knows
you put a cowboy against anyone, the cowboy's

12
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,580
coming out on top. Sure, except for zombie
cyborgs, obviously. Dude, zombies are like the

13
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:42,300
easiest things to kill except when they're
cyborgs. Except when the cyborg has a zombie

14
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:48,060
brain. No, he has a human brain, it's reanimated,
and he also has a computer brain to go with it.

15
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,160
Marvel needs to make up their mind. Is he a zombie?
Is he a cyborg? What's going on? He's a winner is

16
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:58,460
what he is. And we're going to find out later on this
episode when he beats Jonah Hex. Before we get into

17
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,500
that battle, we're going to break down the latest
comic book movie news to come out this past week, of

18
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,320
which we have a few news items, including the news
that Brainiac has been confirmed as the villain

19
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,660
for the Man of Tomorrow film. We got a couple
surprise crossover comic books released by

20
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,560
Marvel and DC, the publishing divisions. And we
also learned there is a Jimmy Olsen spin-off

21
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,700
television series in development. As always, we
list our segment times in the episode

43
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:21,860
way, quick to the No Prize. A No Prize is an award
that Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version,

44
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:27,260
the Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award that
we post on Instagram for the person that we feel

45
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:33,100
gave the best answer to our question of the week.
Last week, we asked you guys, what Marvel or DC

46
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:39,380
movie or television show from 2025 has been your
favorite and why? And this is coming off of the end

47
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,900
of Peacemaker Season 2, which was the final show
released by Marvel or DC for this year. There's

48
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,960
nothing really else that they're putting out
that's new. So we wanted to get your guys'

49
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,520
opinions. Let's run down our honorable mentions
as well as the No Prize winner. Our first honorable

50
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:58,420
mention goes to Alex Albro, who said, Not to be a
dead horse, but it's got to be Superman. You know, I

51
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,920
was worried about this movie, but you could feel
the excitement in the parking lot in line for

52
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,560
concessions in the theater. Seeing him bleed in
the opening moments was so abnormal and crazy. To

53
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,120
me, you know, this was a big determining factor in
whether or not I keep up with DC. And it sold me. Made

54
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,780
me like a character I've historically disliked
for a long time. Plus, you know, my wife liked it a

55
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,640
lot too, which is great because she only goes to
these movies because I ask her to. She's not a huge

56
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,900
fan, but she really liked Superman. Yeah, one of
the biggest criticisms against Superman is that

57
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:35,220
he's too powerful. So for this movie to open the way
it did with him losing his first battle and we get to

58
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,820
see him bruised and bleeding, I'm sure it was a
shock for a lot of people who make that criticism

59
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,640
against the character. Yeah, I think James Gunn
knows that a vulnerable Superman is an

60
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,960
interesting Superman, whether that be
emotionally vulnerable or physically

61
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,320
vulnerable. I think that's one of the main reasons
why this particular movie resonated with fans as

62
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:58,520
much as it did this year. Great answer, Alex. Our
next honorable mention goes to Colby Hinchus, who

63
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:05,300
said, Hey, boys, Colby Hinchus, the best Marvel DC
project of 2025 was Superman. That movie had no

64
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:10,460
right being as good as it was. I've watched it
probably 20 times since it's been on Max. It's

65
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,520
everything I wanted DC movie to be. It's
everything the Snyderverse wasn't, which makes

66
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:21,920
it great. Yeah, James Gunn's approach to
Superman, making him more human, is pretty much

67
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,760
exactly the opposite of what Zack Snyder tried to
do, which was essentially to deify the character.

68
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,980
And whereas James Gunn's Superman was
empathetic, even going so far as to save squirrels

69
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:38,420
in Zack Snyder's universe, of course, you have pod
can't questioning whether Clark Kent should even

70
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:44,880
save a school bus full of children. They could not
be more different. And I think the success of James

71
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:52,220
Gunn's Superman goes to show how people expect the
character of Superman to be. He nailed that. Do you

72
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:58,160
think James Gunn's Superman film affects your
star rating for the Man of Steel movie? I still like

73
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,300
Man of Steel. I think it's an interesting
Elseworlds tale. Like a sci-fi take on Superman, I

74
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:10,300
think is really cool. But I do think that James Gunn
nailed the character of Superman that I am more

75
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:16,520
familiar with from the comics. Gotcha. I would say
James Gunn is more of a comic fan, whereas Zack

76
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:22,020
Snyder is probably more of like a philosophy and
mythology fan, I suppose. Well, great answer to

77
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:28,860
Colby. Our final honorable mention goes to by Dear
Bangora. Who said? Oh, Daniel, I think the best

78
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:37,600
show of 2020. To be the second only the second.
We'll turn again. I think the pacing are better.

79
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,700
The story telling was better. You can see that it
was a bit different from there. And you can also see

80
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:49,180
that the story and continues. And it seems like a
continuation of the previous Daredevil series.

81
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:55,520
So for me, it has to be the second half of Daredevil.
One again. See, I'm the opposite. I actually liked

82
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,900
the opening of Daredevil born again more than the
closing. Well, the first episode was fantastic,

83
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,280
right? Or at least the first part of the first
episode. I enjoyed the show overall, and you could

84
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,620
definitely listen to our review of that series
while it didn't quite hold up to the Netflix

85
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,980
series. I think it's still very much carried on the
torch that the Netflix series started. The show

86
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:18,540
runners didn't switch halfway through the
season. So I guess I'm a little bit confused why by

87
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:24,220
dear preferred the second half. But I will say that
the series did kind of meander a little bit in the

88
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,460
middle of the season and didn't quite pick back up
until we got into the Muse story arc. Great answer

89
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:36,500
by dear, but the winner of this week's No Prize is
Travis Herndon. Who said? What's up, Dany Medus?

90
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,299
Travis here. Shout out to Maevele Twin. So my
answer would be your friendly neighborhood,

91
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:45,180
Spider-Man. I know like since the teaser trailer
and pictures and stuff came out, everybody was

92
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:51,520
bashing on it from the art style to it being quote
unquote woke because of the great swaps and even

93
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:56,700
you guys were a little bit against it. But after it
came out, the show was really good. Love how the

94
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,680
origins of certain heroes and villains and
everything. And I really enjoyed the show and I

95
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,960
can't wait for season two. So yeah. Yeah. The
reason that Travis won this week's No Prize is

96
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,100
largely because one, he gave an original answer,
but also I have a lot to say about your friendly

97
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,780
neighborhood, Spider-Man. Now, quick
disclaimer, I haven't finished the season yet.

98
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:22,400
I've only on episode like four or five, I think. But
I can see where people would enjoy it because the

99
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:28,540
animation is fantastic. Done in the Steve Ditko
art style, the way Spider-Man moves and like

100
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:33,160
swings through the city is probably the most
dynamic and visually spectacular the character

101
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,640
has ever looked in animation. Obviously not more
so than the Spider-Verse films, though. I was just

102
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:45,380
about to say what? Yeah. The music is fantastic in
the show. So it looks and sounds amazing. That

103
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,920
being said, my gripes with the show still hold from
my criticisms of when the show was being

104
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,520
developed. It was initially marketed as being an
animated version of the MCU. Peter Parker giving

105
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,320
us a look at his early days of being Spider-Man
during his freshman year. In fact, the show was

106
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,160
called Spider-Man freshman year. They changed it
to your friendly neighborhood, Spider-Man, when

107
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,520
it was clear it was no longer going to be an MCU
Spidey, but rather a multiversal variant of

108
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:18,560
Spidey. And the story is close enough to the MCU
Spider-Man to kind of just piss you off because

109
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,560
they make a whole bunch of changes that I feel like
were unnecessary. Not in terms of like race

110
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:28,500
bending or anything like that, but in terms of like
having Peter go through experiences in his

111
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,640
freshman year that we know that MCU Peter went
through in his sophomore year, changing things

112
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:39,440
like his crush from Liz to Pearl, changing things
like his origin being magical in nature and that he

113
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,260
was bitten by a spider that came through a mystical
portal. As a matter of fact, Doctor Strange was

114
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:49,240
there when Peter Parker got bit in this series,
which kind of negates the whole introduction that

115
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,640
they had where Peter Parker was like, oh, we're
going by our made up names. So I'm Spider-Man, you

116
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,600
know. So there's a lot that the series takes away
from MCU Spidey. At the end of the day, I still

117
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,540
really wanted this to be what it was initially
marketed as, as Tom Holland's Spider-Man's

118
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:09,720
origin story. It's clever, sure, and how it
approaches its universe's characters and

119
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,300
origins and things like that. But I've also seen
that done really well in other animated

120
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,160
Spider-Man shows, like Spectacular Spider-Man
or the 90s Spider-Man. I mean, like I've said

121
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,740
before, when I first heard that this was a
multiverse story, I was like, yeah, I'm not going

122
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,780
to watch that. Is it worth watching? Do you
recommend it? I think if you're a Spider-Man fan

123
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:34,100
who isn't sick of seeing his original story
rehashed time and again, especially if you're a

124
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,600
fan of the early Ditko comic books and stuff like
that, I think it's worth checking out for sure. OK,

125
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,040
so I should not watch it. Yeah, probably not. Yes.
Well, great answer, Travis. I'm glad you like the

126
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,680
show. Congrats on winning this week's No Prize. If
you, the listener, want to shot at winning your own

127
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:54,460
No Prize, stay tuned to later on in this episode
when we'll be asking another question of the week.

128
00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:06,700
But now that that's done, on to the news. OK, the
world's worst kept secret. It was revealed last

129
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:13,840
week by Umberto Gonzalez of The Wrap that the main
villain of the Superman sequel, Man of Tomorrow,

130
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,540
is Brainiac. Now, we all suspected that this was
going to be the case. James Gunn didn't

131
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:27,220
necessarily even try to hide it going so far as to
put an image of a brain on the script cover for Man of

132
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:34,060
Tomorrow. But I do got to say with this news
confirmed, I am super excited to see Brainiac in

133
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:39,400
live action. He's the number one villain I've
always wanted to see in a Superman movie. There's

134
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:45,100
been a lot of depictions of him in a lot of other
media, like the animated series, like the video

135
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,540
games, like Injustice, or even like the My
Adventures with Superman cartoon that came out

136
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,760
last year. I think with the advent of AI in real
life, this is a very timely villain. And I'm super

137
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:02,320
stoked to see him go toe to toe up against both
Superman and Lex Luthor. Oh, yeah, super timely.

138
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,680
Although is Brainiac AI what you consider him?
Sometimes he is. Sometimes he's more like an

139
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,980
alien. What's your preferred version of
Brainiac? Oh, that's a good question. I actually

140
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:19,860
do prefer it when he is an AI who maybe kind of
developed his own body. The Kaluan version is not

141
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,700
my favorite version, though I wouldn't hate it if
they went that direction. Brainiac, if you

142
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:30,820
remember, in our Brainiac versus Ultron match is
from the planet Colu, a alien race of super

143
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:36,320
intelligent beings. And he was like the smartest
one. I really liked the version that was in My

144
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,540
Adventures with Superman season two. He was
really unique in there. Of course, Brainiac has

145
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:45,020
been in a few animated movies as well, including
one from the 90s called Superman Brainiac

146
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,720
attacks. And then I think he was also the main
antagonist in Superman Unbound. Yes, that's

147
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:55,360
correct. And he was also in Superman Red Sun. I'm
super curious to see who they're going to cast in

148
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,400
the role. I'm hoping they're going to make that
announcement soon because this movie starts

149
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:04,240
filming in April, surprisingly, which is
awesome. Like remember when they used to make

150
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,280
superhero movies back to back? Yeah, they would
like release the movie and then the following year

151
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,920
they would film the sequel so that the following
year after that they would release the sequel. So

152
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,600
we would get the sequels a couple years apart from
each other as opposed to five, six, seven years

153
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,960
apart looking at you, Shang-Chi. Yeah, this is the
way to do it. Brainiac is the way to go. I am all

154
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,160
aboard the hype train. Just be sure to check your
expectations right out of the gate, Jonathan. You

155
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:33,440
haven't even seen the Supergirl movie yet. Oh, I
wonder if they'll have like an end credits teaser

156
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:40,700
of Brainiac. That would be dope. Sure. And other DC
Superman related news. We also learned that DC

157
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:48,380
Studios is developing a Jimmy Olsen spin off TV
series from the character that we saw in the

158
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:54,600
Superman movie. It's from the American Vandal
creators. If you're familiar with that show, it's

159
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:00,600
on Netflix. It won a Peabody and I think it was
nominated for an Emmy. It's a fantastic show. If

160
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,820
you haven't seen it, hilarious. And I wonder if
they're going to take the same kind of

161
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:12,720
mockumentary approach with this Jimmy Olsen spin
off show. Some people are calling it DC crime. I'm

162
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,980
not sure why. I don't think James Gunn knows why
either. But I'm all there for it because it looks

163
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:23,340
like a lot of the Daily Planet stars are set to
return. I mean, that's great because I would say

164
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:29,360
that the Daily Planet cast was underutilized and
largely pointless in the Superman movie, which

165
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,600
was surprising considering the cast that they had
for them, you know, like Beck Bennett, Wendell

166
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,340
Pierce, McKayla Hoover and Christopher
McDonald. They played Steve Lombard, Perry

167
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:45,900
White, Kat Grant and Ron Troupe respectively. I
also wonder if maybe David Cornswet and Rachel

168
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:51,760
Brosnahan will return to their roles also as Clark
and Lois. That would be cool. I'm not sure how

169
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:57,480
excited people are about this, but I remember when
they announced the powerless television show,

170
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,300
people were bitching about that for some reason,
because I found the premise quite interesting.

171
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:06,900
And then the show came out and like you liked it, you
watched it. You thought it was great, but it ended

172
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,680
up getting canceled early, largely due to the lack
of interest in it. I hope that doesn't happen with

173
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:17,260
this. Yes, this is a television series that no one
asked for. That doesn't mean it won't be good. I

174
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:22,340
mean, I asked for this. I love this. I think if DC
wants to get this off the ground, they should just

175
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:28,060
title this spin off series The Daily Planet. Yeah,
you got brand name recognition right there. I

176
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:34,080
would also accept the adventures of Jimmy Olsen.
No, no one's going to watch that. I would. And I hope

177
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:39,040
he would get turtle powers. Apparently the show is
going to revolve also around Gorilla Grodd,

178
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:45,240
though. Maybe it's like Jimmy Olsen tracking
Gorilla Grodd in Metropolis. And that sounds

179
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:51,180
amazing. How are you not excited about this?
Anyone who's not excited about this? Because you

180
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:56,660
should be. I mean, throwing in Gorilla Grodd does
sound a little bit ridiculous, but in the best way.

181
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:03,840
OK, in other news, in comic book news, actually, in
a follow up to the Deadpool, Batman, Marvel and DC

182
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:10,060
crossover comic event from earlier this year, the
publishers dropped two surprise web comics on DC

183
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:16,839
Universe Infinite and Marvel Unlimited, a flash
and fantastic for crossover story and a Shazam

184
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:24,000
Thor crossover story. I think largely it was a
means of promoting the other publishers' digital

185
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,420
subscription content, because it was the
weirdest thing. As a Marvel Unlimited

186
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:36,240
subscriber, I suddenly got an email from Marvel
with an offer to subscribe to DC Comics. It was so

187
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,220
fucking disturbing. It's like hell is freezing
over. Yeah. And I don't know, like, is that a good

188
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:47,520
thing? What's happening? Is the science of like a
consistent partnership and collaboration going

189
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,280
forward? Maybe even potentially a merger down the
line? Better not. Is all I'm saying. We got to keep

190
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,460
these things separate. Otherwise, I'm not going
to know who to root for. It would be like Star Wars

191
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:02,600
and Star Trek promoting each other's content.
Yeah, or like Pepsi and Coke joining forces to

192
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:08,740
release a new drink together. Ew. Pepsi Coke. That
sounds disgusting. I would spit that out. Same

193
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:14,080
here. That being said, if Marvel and DC want to
collaborate on a fighting video game, combining

194
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:20,220
the two universes, I would be all for that. That is
all I've ever wanted in life. I did read the Shazam

195
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:25,260
Thor crossover comic book. I thought it was pretty
good that you teamed up against Mr. Mind. I enjoyed

196
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:34,800
it. But this crossover event brings us to our
question of the week. Well, Marvel versus DC

197
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:41,760
crossover, have you always wanted to see in the
comics? And why? Out of all the crossovers we've

198
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,060
gotten from the publishers, including, you know,
the 90s DC versus Marvel crossover and even before

199
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:52,420
that, like the original Superman versus
Spider-Man and Hulk versus Batman. Later on in the

200
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:58,420
2000s, we got JLA Avengers. And then recently, of
course, the various crossover events. Besides

201
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:03,960
those, what two characters from Marvel and DC have
you always wanted to read about teaming up or going

to answer before November 22nd. But that doesn't

207
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:40,400
for all the news this week. So let's go ahead and
move into our main event for this episode, where we

208
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:46,380
find out who would win in a fight between the DC
character of Jonah Hex and the Marvel character of

209
00:19:46,380 --> 00:20:06,360
Deathlock. All right, Jonah Hex versus
Deathlock. We've been trying to get both of these

210
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:13,020
characters in a duel for years now. And the time has
finally come. They're both semi popular, I think,

211
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:18,880
within their respective universes. Jonah Hex
even had a film adaptation and he was a prominent

212
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,120
character in one of the seasons of Legends of
Tomorrow. Yeah, he was also featured in an episode

213
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:30,900
of the Batman animated series and had his own DC
showcase short, which was pretty good. Yeah, I

214
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:36,520
really liked that one. Deathlock hasn't been in as
much media, I would say. There was a version of the

215
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,720
character that was in the agents of shield
television series, although it wasn't the

216
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,860
version of the character that I'll be going with,
which is the original Deathlock from the comic

217
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:49,220
books named Luther Manning. Basically, the other
versions of Deathlock would be way too damn

218
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,580
powerful for Jonah Hex. So we went with the
original and let's beefed up a version of

219
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:59,560
Deathlock. Yeah, basically, the reason we and the
executive producers decided to pit these two

220
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:04,120
characters against each other is because we think
they're awesome. And also because they have a lot

221
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:10,940
of similarities in terms of like half of their face
is missing and they're also really good marksmen

222
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:16,820
with their guns. That's pretty much it. Yeah,
you're right. I don't know much about Jonah Hex, so

223
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:21,760
I'm interested in learning how accurate the movie
adaptation was for the character. Well, I'm here

224
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,700
to set the record straight about how sucky their
interpretation of Jonah Hex was. But before that,

225
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,520
to explain the methodology behind our duels,
let's go to our sentient dual simulator, Alfred

226
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:39,880
Jarvis, 9000. AJ9K, tell our listeners how you go
about determining a winner in our dual matchups.

227
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:45,240
Yes, of course, sir. The way I determine a winner
between the contestants is by running 1000 Monte

228
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:50,100
Carlo simulations using the characters
statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation is a

229
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:55,020
probabilistic model used to determine outcomes
through random sampling. In this case, I

230
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:59,200
randomize the statistics along a normal
distribution as a way to simulate the many

231
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,140
variables that can occur during battle. The stat
parameters are based on the official Marvel power

232
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:09,420
grid from which the DC characters statistics are
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are

233
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:14,920
included such as range, damage potential,
versatility and perception in order to create a

234
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,920
more detailed and accurate simulation. The
results of the 1000 simulations provide a

235
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,860
percentage of wins for each character. The
contestant with the higher percentage is

236
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:28,680
declared the victor as they have a higher
probability to win any given battle. In an

237
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:34,100
equitable pairing, neither character should win
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have

238
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,960
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat
Superman. So the confidence rate of my method

239
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,020
falls in line with the precedents that have been
established in the source material. My

240
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,500
mathematical simulations are without
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole

241
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:53,980
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K.

242
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:57,240
Before we run the simulations, though, we like to
break down each character's histories and

243
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,440
abilities before improvising a scenario on how we
imagine one of the 1000 simulations would play out

244
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:07,480
beat for beat. And I believe it's my turn to go first
with the Marvel characters backstory. So let me

245
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:14,020
tell you all about Deathlock. Luther Manning was a
Detroit, Michigan native from an alternate

246
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:21,480
reality called Earth 7484 in the greater Marvel
multiverse. He enlisted in the US Army and rose to

247
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,780
the rank of Colonel before the political collapse
of his reality. In his timeline, the Age of Heroes

248
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:33,220
ended when the multinational corporation,
RocksOn, used dimensional technology to

249
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:39,100
eliminate Earth's superhumans. The aftermath
triggered widespread war and devastation across

250
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:44,600
the United States. Manning served through this
turmoil, but during a training exercise, he was

251
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:49,420
critically injured by a concussion bomb.
Declared legally dead after failing to survive

252
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:56,620
surgery, he was selected by Major Simon Riker for
Project Alphamec, a covert initiative intended

253
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:02,780
to produce cyborg soldiers. Manning's remains
were rebuilt by Simon's brother Harlan, who

254
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:08,460
transplanted Manning's brain, nervous system,
and surviving organic tissue into a cybernetic

255
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:14,980
body. After five years in stasis, Manning was
reanimated as the cyborg Deathlock, named for his

256
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:20,020
ability to be locked into a suspended death-like
state. Riker oversaw his training and

257
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:25,800
deployment, intending to use the cyborgs to seize
global power, while Harlan pursued his own vision

258
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:32,100
of replacing humanity entirely with cyborgs that
he called Homo Ascendant. As Deathlock's human

259
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:37,520
memories reemerged, he began resisting his
program's directives and ultimately broke free

260
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,360
of Riker's control. In discovering his new
condition, he learned that he had been declared

261
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:48,260
dead and that his wife had remarried his friend,
Mike Travers. Unable to take his own life due to

262
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:53,460
built-in fail safes, he instead dedicated
himself to undermining Riker, who at overtime

263
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:58,920
also become a cyborg through his brother Harlan's
experiments. Riker attempted to merge with New

264
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:04,740
York's Omni Computer to become the digital entity
called Savier Machine, but Deathlock forced him

265
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:10,380
out, leaving Riker mentally shattered. The CIA
attempted to restore Luther's humanity by

266
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,780
transferring his consciousness into a cloned
human body, but the process only recreated his

267
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:21,740
memories in the clone while leaving the cyborg
unchanged. Deathlock continued operating for

268
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:27,140
the agency, primarily targeting the threat of
Harlan Riker, now operating as the cyborg

269
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:32,140
Hellinger. During this period, Deathlock
encountered a time-traveling Spider-Man from

270
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:37,780
Earth 616, Marvel's primary timeline, as an early
sign of the temporal disruptions that would

271
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:43,700
repeatedly intersect with Luther's life.
Deathlock soon encountered Godwolf, a former

272
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:49,240
rocks-on operative turned rebel leader who
sought to save what remained of America after the

273
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:53,840
elimination of the world's superhumans plunged
into chaos. To protect him from Hellinger's

274
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,760
forces, Godwolf displaced Deathlock through
time to Earth 616. There, Deathlock assisted the

275
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:06,300
mystic hero Devil Slayer against a cult before an
attempt to return him home was intercepted by the

276
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:12,760
Fixer and Mintello. The villains implanted a
control device in Luther and used the cyborg in an

277
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:18,000
assassination plot against the US president, but
their plan was stopped by the Fantastic Four and

278
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,320
the Impossible Man. Freed from external control,
Deathlock entered a catatonic state and was taken

279
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:30,280
into shield custody. Agents of Earth 616's
rocks-on later stole Deathlock's cyborg body and

280
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,660
delivered it to their corporation facility,
where this timeline's version of Harlan Riker

281
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:39,740
examined it. Riker created a fully robotic
Deathlock duplicate which was subsequently

282
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:46,060
destroyed by the Thing and Quasar. Meanwhile,
Luther's true body was reprogrammed by rocks-on

283
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:51,920
for their efforts toward repeating the actions of
Earth 7484 and eliminating the world's

284
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:57,140
superhumans. In Luther's native reality,
Godwolf sent a clone of Luther back in time to

285
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:02,380
locate the original Deathlock. Luther killed the
clone during the confrontation, but the dying

286
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:06,780
duplicate's touch restored Deathlock's
suppressed memories and freed him from

287
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:12,260
rocks-on's programming. Deathlock returned to
his timeline with Captain America and Godwolf's

288
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:17,960
team called the Redeemers to stop Hellinger from
deploying an army of doomsday mechs. Though

289
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:23,600
Hellinger briefly took control of Deathlock's
systems, Luther resisted long enough to kill him.

290
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,320
Captain America's subsequent actions in Earth
616 prevented rocks-on from destroying his

291
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,380
country, causing Marvel's reality to diverge
from the timeline that produced Manning.

292
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:38,500
Deathlock remained active in Earth 7484,
assisting Godwolf against the foreign ruler

293
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:43,520
Timestream after the Redeemers were killed in an
An assault that triggered further global

294
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:48,620
destruction. Disillusioned upon learning
Godwolf had hidden crucial information from him,

295
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:53,400
Deathlok abandoned the struggle. He later fought
alongside the deviant Tantalus, though these

296
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:59,120
battles did little to alter the ongoing collapse
of his world. Upon learning that remnants of

297
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:05,420
Roxxon had resumed their efforts to eliminate
superhumans in Earth 616, Deathlok traveled back

298
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:10,620
to that reality, only to be shut down and seized by
SHIELD. Though repaired under the assumption he

299
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:15,460
could be controlled, Deathlok rebooted
autonomously, destroyed Roxxon's developing

300
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:21,500
technology, and returned to his native timeline
once again. By 2011, the computer core within

301
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:27,260
Luther's body had deteriorated, leaving him
operating in a severely degraded state and forced

302
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:33,280
to survive on his own. TimeStream reappeared and
recruited him with promises to rewrite the past so

303
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,720
that he would never become Deathlok. The scheme
drew the attention of the Time Variance

304
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:42,940
Authority, who sent Godwolf to stop him.
TimeStream recruited the human Luther Manning of

305
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:50,260
Earth 616, while Godwolf enlisted Earth 616's
version of Deathlok named Michael Collins.

306
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:55,760
Luther eventually discovered TimeStream's true
nature and cited with Michael Collins to end his

307
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:01,160
plans. Regarding the Earth 616 version of
Deathlok that I just mentioned, Michael Collins

308
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:06,860
was a computer programmer and neuroscientist
born in Philadelphia who earned advanced degrees

309
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:12,860
in prosthetics. A pacifist devoted to ethical
technological development, he joined CyberTech

310
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:17,740
Systems, which was a Roxxon subsidiary,
believing his work in neural prosthetics would

311
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:22,960
benefit the disabled. Unaware of his company's
secret Deathlok program, Collins only learned

312
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:28,020
the truth when he discovered his research had been
appropriated for weapons development. When he

313
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:33,660
confronted his superior, Harlan Riker, Collins
was shot with a sedative and his brain was

314
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:39,540
transplanted into CyberTech's newest Deathlok
cyborg. Upon awakening in the cyborg body,

315
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:43,940
Michael Collins initially had no control over its
actions and witnessed the machine killing

316
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:49,340
soldiers during field testing. Gradually, he
asserted his will, preventing the killing of a

317
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:54,780
child and overriding the program's lethality
protocols by imposing a strict no-killing

318
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:59,840
parameter on the system. He learned that his
original human body still existed and tracked

319
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,120
Harlan Riker to a weapons deal, capturing him
before turning him over to authorities.

320
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,960
Michael's existence as Deathlok brought him into
contact with SHIELD, the Fantastic Four, the

321
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,080
X-Men, Spider-Man, and other heroes. He
participated in efforts ranging from preventing

322
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:19,860
a nuclear strike on the United States to stopping
the Sinister Six and assisting in the defeat of

323
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:25,800
Carnage. During this period, he revealed his
cyborg identity to his family, his wife Tracy,

324
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,120
their children Nicholas and Tisha, and his
extended relatives while continuing to search

325
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:36,000
for a way to restore his original body. Michael was
later abducted to a distant world by the cosmic

326
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,860
scientist called The Stranger and lived there for
years with other superhumans until their

327
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:45,460
eventual escape. After the group's escape from
the alien world, Michael found that he could

328
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:50,980
revert to human form at will. However, once he
arrived back on Earth, he was unable to transform

329
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:57,160
back into Deathlok, ending his tenure as the hero.
Meanwhile, Luther Manning, the original

330
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,980
Deathlok, still resentful of Godwulf's
manipulations, stole a time gauntlet and

331
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:07,820
abandoned his native timeline, traveling
permanently to Earth 616. There he lived in the

332
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:12,360
sewers of Manhattan where he helped protect
innocent residents of an underground community

333
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:17,980
called the Tunnel Dwellers before departing them
to contemplate his existence. There have been

334
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:22,800
several other victims of the Deathlok program
over the years, including Harlan Riker's own

335
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:29,280
daughter, called Deathlokit. But that is the
history of the two primary Deathloks. For this

336
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:33,620
still, I'll be going with the original Luther
Manning version of the character because Michael

337
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:39,920
Collins is just way too strong and durable for it to
be a fair fight against Jonah Hex. Powers-wise,

338
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:45,300
Luther Manning's Deathlok has a reanimated body
with cyborg enhancements. This gives him

339
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:50,800
increased strength, able to lift 10 tons, and
enhanced durability. His mind reacts and

340
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:55,660
processes information at computer speeds and
allows for tracking and targeting multiple

341
00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:01,600
subjects. He carries a helium neon laser pistol
and a 9 inch throwing dagger that magnetically

342
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,680
attaches to his calf. As a former US Army colonel,
he is a trained hand combatant, marksman, and

343
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:13,580
strategist. And that's Deathlok. I wanted to get
into the backstory of both the primary Deathlok

344
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:19,260
from Earth 74-84 and into the Earth 616 Deathlok,
which was Michael Collins. They both have very

345
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,720
different backstories. And actually, the
Michael Collins version of the character was

346
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,540
created by Dwayne McDuffie, who also created
characters like Static and Icon for Milestone

347
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:36,360
Comics. I'm legit surprised that we have not had a
Deathlok movie. I mean, just listening to that

348
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:43,260
backstory, it sounds like a 90s movie. Well, I
mean, Robocop ripped it off wholesale. Deathlok

349
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:48,620
came out in the 70s, Robocop came out in the 80s, but
it's essentially the same exact story. Deathlok

350
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:53,400
just looks a little bit more zombie cyborg.
Henceforth, I will always watch Robocop thinking

351
00:32:53,400 --> 00:33:01,120
of it as a Deathlok movie in the same way that I watch
Ghost thinking of it as a Deadman movie. The 80s,

352
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,780
man. They were just ripping off comic book stories
all the time. Well, if Robocop is essentially

353
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:12,400
Deathlok, I do have to say that his movie is better
than the Jonah Hex movie, but the Jonah Hex comic

354
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:18,300
storyline would have made a better one. So let me
get into his backstory from the comics. Jonah Hex

355
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:25,540
was born in 1838 in Missouri to Woodson and
Virginia Hex. His childhood was defined by

356
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:32,540
Woodson's drinking and violent outbursts until
Virginia fled, leaving Jonah behind. At 13, Jonah

357
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:39,020
traveled west with Woodson during the Gold Rush.
In need of safe passage, Woodson sold Jonah to an

358
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:45,480
Apache tribe. Jonah lived as a slave until he saved
their chief from a Puma, at which point he was

359
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:51,340
adopted as a member of the tribe. He learned Apache
methods of hunting and tracking, and he formed

360
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:58,860
bonds with the chief's son, Notante, and a young
woman named White Fawn. At age 16, Jonah and

361
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:06,520
Notante undertook a rite of passage to steal Kiowa
horses. During the raid, Notante betrayed Jonah,

362
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:12,400
striking him unconscious and leaving him behind
to claim White Fawn for himself. Taken prisoner,

363
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:18,219
Jonah survived a US cavalry assault on the Kiowa,
but was shot in the stomach when he tried to stop the

364
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:24,139
soldiers from killing children. Left for dead, he
was rescued by an old trapper. When Jonah later

365
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:29,040
attempted to return to the Apache, they had
relocated, forcing him to wander the frontier

366
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:35,600
alone. As a young man, Jonah enlisted as a cavalry
scout for the US Army, then joined the Confederacy

367
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:41,020
when the Civil War began, believing he was
defending his homeland. He rose to lieutenant in

368
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:45,860
the 4th Calvary and fought alongside Jeb
Turnbull. After learning of the Emancipation

369
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:51,120
Proclamation, Jonah could no longer justify the
cause and deserted to Fort Charlotte to

370
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:56,860
surrender. He refused to reveal his unit's
position, but a Union aide identified it from the

371
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:02,740
clay on Jonah's horse's hooves. The Confederates
were captured, and the Union commander staged a

372
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:09,220
false escape tunnel so his starving men could kill
the fleeing prisoners. Most of Jonah's comrades,

373
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:14,720
including Jeb, were slaughtered. Jonah
survived, killed the commander, and escaped.

374
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,440
Labeled a traitor, Jonah was not allowed to return
to the Confederate lines. He returned to the

375
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,660
Apache instead, seeking acceptance and
discovered that Notante had married White Fawn.

376
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:32,380
Jonah accused him of betrayal, and the chief
ordered a trial by combat. Notante sabotaged

377
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:39,400
Jonah's tomahawk, and Jonah resorted to a knife,
violating tribal law. He killed Notante, and it

378
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:46,000
was branded across the right side of his face, the
mark of a demon, before being exiled. Years later,

379
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:56,900
when Jonah returned to the Apache tribe to rescue a
White captive, he was captured Jonah broke free,

380
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:01,960
killed the chief, and gunned down several
warriors before fleeing permanently. Jonah

381
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:06,980
wandered the frontier until the day he shot a man
beating his wife in the street. The man was an

382
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:13,500
outlaw named Lucas Mad Dog McGill, and the deputy
who arrived recognized the bounty on his head.

383
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:19,500
Realizing he could earn a living, killing men like
McGill, Jonah became a bounty hunter. His first

384
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:26,480
major hunt ended with rival manhunter Arby
Stoneham taking his query and guns. Years later,

385
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,580
after Jonah had become widely feared, he found
Stoneham crippled and chose to leave the past

386
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:37,120
behind. Jonah spent decades tracking outlaws,
foiling land schemes, clashing with corrupt

387
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:42,200
lawmen, and at times working with the US Secret
Service, including disrupting an assassination

388
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:48,900
attempt on President Grant. He tried to protect
peaceful tribes, but often arrived too late. His

389
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,480
survival of gunfights, while wounded,
outnumbered, or temporarily blinded, cemented

390
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:58,740
his reputation as one of the deadliest men alive.
Jonah's path occasionally crossed with larger

391
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:05,080
forces. He was abducted by the Lord of Time as one of
the five warriors from forever, and turned

392
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:11,420
against the Justice League and Justice Society
before breaking free and returning to his era. He

393
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:17,000
later rode with Western legends like Bat-Lash,
Cinnamon, and Skellpunter when the league was

394
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:23,260
thrown into the 19th century, and he fought Shadow
Demon during the crisis on Infinite Earth. Jonah

395
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:29,700
tried repeatedly to abandon violence. He married
Mei Ling, who insisted he quit bounty hunting.

396
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:35,620
After a fire destroyed their farm, Jonah secretly
resumed the work to pay debts, and Mei Ling left

397
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:41,740
him. Their son Jason later sought Jonah out as an
adult, but the two failed to reconcile. Jonah

398
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:46,860
formed an on-and-offigan partnership with
Tallulah Black, a scarred gunfighter avenging

399
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:52,820
her murdered family. He also encountered bizarre
frontier threats, including zombies raised by a

400
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:58,720
traveling surgeon, the subterranean autumn
brothers, cannibal clans, and corrupt Wild West

401
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:06,340
show promoters. In 1875, Jonah was abducted in a
flash of light by Reinhold Borstyn, and taken to a

402
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:12,500
post-apocalyptic 21st century Seattle. He
escaped Borstyn's lab, allied briefly with a Road

403
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:18,040
Reapers biker gang, donned a radiation-proof
zone suit, and fought through mutants,

404
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:24,000
mercenaries, and alien-backed warlords. He
became entangled in Sven Tara's rebellion

405
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:31,040
against the invading Exiggs. During his time in
the future, Jonah discovered his own taxidermied

406
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:37,200
corpse in a carnival exhibit, confirming his
eventual return and death in his own era. Though

407
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:43,280
the means are unknown, Jonah did return to the
past. By the early 20th century, he lived with a

408
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,960
woman named Talbird. In 1904, George Barrow
murdered Jonah in a saloon, with Sheriff Hank

409
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:56,800
Crawford shooting Barrow immediately. Showman
L.B. Farmham stole Jonah's body, stuffed it in

410
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,580
gaudy clothes, and exhibited it until Talbird
reclaimed it. When the collector later attempted

411
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:08,880
to seize the corpse, he was shot in the back by an
unseen figure, implied to be a time-traveling

412
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:15,500
Jonah himself. In post-Flashpoint continuity,
Jonah's early life remained mostly unchanged.

413
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:20,280
His Confederate service and the Fort Charlotte
massacre again left him wandering the West as a

414
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:26,740
bounty hunter with a strict moral code. In the
1880s, he traveled to Gotham at the request of Dr.

415
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:32,460
Armadeus Arkham to hunt the Gotham Butcher. Jonah
uncovered ties between the murderers and the

416
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:38,060
religion of crime, drawing him into conflict with
corrupt officials, industrialists, and secret

417
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:44,380
societies. He fought through ambushes, machine
gun traps, subterranean tunnels, and child labor

418
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:49,760
rings beneath the city. He encountered the
ancestors of the Wayne family, remnants of

419
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,900
ancient tribes, and early agents of the Courts of
Owls while dismantling the crime-bible network.

420
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:00,600
Jonah resumed life on the trail with Tallulah
Black until an encounter with Booster Gold

421
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:06,540
displaced him in the 21st century. Mistaking for
an unstable impersonator, he was committed to

422
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:12,820
Arkham Asylum until Dr. Jeremiah Arkham
confirmed his identity. Jonah adapted quickly,

423
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:17,780
assisting modern heroes against criminals,
monsters, and occult threats. He formed a

424
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:23,560
relationship with a woman named Gina, and after a
drunk driving accident left him comatose,

425
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:29,260
surgeons repaired his scarred face. Booster
eventually returned Jonah to the Old West, with

426
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:34,660
Gina accompanying him, though she died crossing
the desert. Jonah also learned that an imposter

427
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:41,220
with a similar scar had committed crimes using his
name. When Jonah killed him, he gave his name as

428
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:48,160
George Barrow, in effect, faking his own death.
During the rise of the Dark Multiverse, Jonah was

429
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,500
resurrected by a black lantern ring and fought
alongside Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman

430
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:59,120
against the Batman who laughs. You can learn more
about in our Batman Who Laughs vs. Cosmic

431
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:04,980
Ghostwriter episode. When his undead body was
destroyed, Jonah's spirit was bound to a cursed

432
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:12,060
firearm, later inherited by his descendant,
Ginny Hex, a member of Young Justice, which you can

433
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:17,800
learn more about in our Young Justice vs. Young
Avengers team duel. The powers-wise, Jonah Hex

434
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:24,420
has no superhuman abilities, but is one of the most
lethal marksmen of any era. He is a trained Apache

435
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:30,340
warrior and hardened bounty hunter, capable of
drawing and firing with exceptional speed and

436
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:36,580
accuracy, even when injured or impaired. He is an
expert tracker, able to follow faint signs across

437
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:42,520
fast terrain, and he is a master with knives,
tomahawks, sabers, and is a brutal hand-to-hand

438
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:47,740
combatant. That's Jonah Hex. Didn't he have
mystical powers in the movie, if I remember

439
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:54,500
correctly? Yes, in the movie, he had a magic touch
that could bring people back to life until he

440
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:59,600
touched them again. That's weird. Yeah,
unnecessary, I think. The character makes for a

441
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:04,580
great Western cowboy without needing a
superpower. He's just a badass, and that's all you

442
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:09,620
need a cowboy to be. Do you think he has enough going
for him to go up against Deathlock? He's gone up

443
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:14,980
against worse, my friend. Yeah, there definitely
seemed like an era where he was taken out of the

444
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:21,020
whole Western genre and put more into like a
post-apocalyptic pulp genre. Yeah, kind of like

445
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:32,840
Deathlock. That's true. That's true. In a world

459
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:02,020
way. Let's speculate on how one of the 1000
simulated matches will go. The winner is

460
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:06,600
determined by simulations, not the speculation,
but it's fun to imagine how the fight could play

461
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:12,840
out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?
Well, I should say there are no rules, other than

462
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:17,340
the characters have no prior knowledge of the
other going into the fight. All they are aware of

463
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:21,920
starting out is that the other character is a
threat that needs to be eliminated. For the

464
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,920
speculation, the contestants will begin
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript

465
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:31,980
environment that will have no bearing on the match
itself, as no environmental statistics are

466
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:37,180
considered in my simulations. The contestants
must earn victory on their own merit. All right,

467
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:42,840
then let's get into it. Jonah Hex and Deathlock
meet on the battlefield. Who goes first? Don't

468
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:49,380
answer that, actually. I already know. Jonah is
literally the fastest draw in the West. So as they

469
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:54,680
square off, staring each other down, Jonah is
going to snap his gun forward, firing a shot that

470
00:44:54,680 --> 00:45:00,740
hits Deathlock, square between the eyes with his
Colt 45 revolver. Blam! Square between

471
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:07,460
Deathlock's eyes is actually flesh, because the
cyborg part of his face doesn't extend directly in

472
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:13,760
the middle, it's just on the left side of his face.
Good. But Deathlock's computer implant grants

473
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:20,360
him enhanced reaction time. So no matter how quick
of a draw Jonah Hex is, Deathlock still has time to

474
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:25,580
like somewhat at least turn his head so that the
bullet actually hits the left side of his face,

475
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:31,300
which is metal. So bullet ricochets and Deathlock
is probably knocked to the ground from the impact.

476
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:36,500
But from the ground, he's going to quickly pull out
his laser pistol and just shoot Jonah Hex through

477
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:42,460
the chest. Oh, you mean where he wears his
bandolier of ammo? I guess Deathlock's shot also

478
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:48,500
hits metal. I mean, I guess a laser pistol might
trigger a round or two to go off, but those bullets

479
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:54,300
are just going to graze Jonah's chest and he's
going to shrug it off. So while Deathlock is still

480
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:59,800
on the ground, Jonah is going to quick draw a second
revolver. And so he's dual wielding. He's going to

481
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:05,240
fire 10 rounds right into Deathlock, killing him
in seconds. No, no, no, Deathlock, he's going to

482
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:10,820
kick off the ground into a back hand spring while
his computer scanner is going to be tracking Jonah

483
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:16,440
Hex's arm position. And that's going to allow
Deathlock to dodge the bullets. And like even the

484
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,360
few that he wouldn't dodge, he'll just shoot out of
the air with his laser gun because he's that

485
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:27,800
accurate at targeting. And as he dodges to one side
to avoid like the last of the bullets from the

486
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:35,820
revolvers with his non shooting hand, Deathlock
grabs and flings his dagger with perfect aim right

487
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:43,040
into Jonah Hex's good eye. Good eye. I'm pretty
sure both eyes are good, but doesn't he have a

488
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:49,560
fucked up eye? Kind of. He can still shoot
perfectly with it, so it can't be that bad. It's

489
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:54,700
just his eyelid that's missing. Oh, so he can't
blink. So he has dry eye. He works with it. He works

490
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:59,860
with it somehow. I'm going to say lucky for him. By
my count, Jonah still had one round left in the

491
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:05,440
chamber, and he's also accurate enough to shoot
the dagger off course. So once he does that without

492
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,800
missing a beat, Jonah is going to charge at
Deathlock using speed loaders that he got from the

493
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:16,700
future to reload his revolver as he runs toward
him, flicking the cylinders into place and

494
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:22,140
cocking those hammers back. He's going to unload
on Deathlock again. Dude is a fucking one trick

495
00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:29,000
pony with his pistols. OK, Deathlock, he's going
to power slide to dodge the gunfire and he

496
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,240
magnetically pulls his dagger back to him. And
while Deathlock is moving to dodge the gunfire,

497
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:40,900
you know, using his enhanced reaction time to help
him, maybe he gets tagged once or twice by this new

498
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:46,460
round of bullets. But that's fine because he can
tank a few rounds at least, no problem. And he's so

499
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:53,280
reflexive and agile, he can even dodge at close
range. So he closes the distance between himself

500
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:59,420
and Jonah Hex. And with his dagger, he just slices
off Jonah Hex's fingers on his right hand. Well,

501
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:07,540
OK. Well, Jonah's probably very pissed off by
that. So he will pull out a tomahawk with his left

502
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:12,900
hand and he's going to chop off Deathlock's arm
with it. Deathlock's arm is metal. The only thing

503
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:17,620
that would happen would be like the tomahawk would
just wedge into his shoulder joint. OK, so you

504
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:23,140
can't use it anymore. Gotcha. He's fine. But while
Deathlock is realizing that that's when Jonah

505
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:29,380
quickly reaches under his trench coat to grab a
sawed off twin barreled shotgun that he keeps at

506
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:35,000
the small of his back, he's going to fire it point
blank at Deathlock's face. Good luck dodging

507
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:39,700
that. Deathlock doesn't need to dodge that. He's
going to block the shot with his mechanical hand,

508
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:45,040
which covers the barrels. So the bullets ricochet
and Jonah is going to catch some of that ricochet

509
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:50,180
from his own shotgun shot. And then Deathlock
punches him hard enough to like send him flying

510
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:57,880
like 20 yards back. What? And Jonah Hex drops the
shotgun, which Deathlock crushes in his hands.

511
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:04,900
Dang it. OK. I'm going to say Jonah knows he's beat.
So he's going to raise his hands and surrender and

512
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:12,680
slowly walk toward Deathlock, admitting defeat.
But just as Jonah gets within range, he's going to

513
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:18,880
quickly scrape a match against the stubble on his
jawline and quickly light a small bundle of

514
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,580
dynamite he had hidden in this pocket. And he's
going to hurl that thing right at Deathlock before

515
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:32,100
just turning and running like hell, basically. So
Deathlock's going to blow up. Jonah Hex wins. And

516
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:38,880
in the aftermath, we'll say Jonah sells Deathlock
cybernetic parts for scrap metal as a bounty. No,

517
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:44,540
Jonah could try to kill Deathlock with dynamite.
But to do that, he would have to throw it with

518
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:50,300
perfect timing, right? So that it would explode
right as it lands near Deathlock. Yeah. But in

519
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:54,380
order to do that, he would have to like, you know,
hold onto the bundle for at least a second before

520
00:49:54,380 --> 00:50:01,460
throwing it. Therefore, Deathlock uses his laser
pistol to shoot the dynamite while Jonah Hex is

521
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:07,640
holding onto it and it just explodes in his hands,
killing him. Yeah, it was it was a short fuse. OK,

522
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:13,040
like Jonah didn't need to hold onto it for very long
at all. But he couldn't even throw the bundle that

523
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:17,620
well, because he has buckshot in his gut from the
ricochet from before. No, no, paint does not

524
00:50:17,620 --> 00:50:24,560
affect Jonah or his aim. Like he's probably had
buckshot lodged in his body parts for years. He's

525
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:30,120
like mostly made out of buckshot. He's like a
cyborg in himself, like a really shitty cyborg.

526
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:36,140
We'll go ahead and leave the match there. OK,
either Jonah Hex manages to pull off exploding

527
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:42,900
Deathlock with a bundle of dynamite or the
dynamite gets shot while Jonah Hex is holding onto

528
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:47,980
it and he blows himself up. We'll see which of those
two scenarios happens when we input the character

529
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:55,460
stats, run the thousand simulations and come back
with a winner. A.J .9K. Hit it. Inputting data,

530
00:50:55,460 --> 00:51:02,060
running calculations, processing results,
simulations complete. All right, I will say that

531
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:07,720
neither of these guys are that impressive
statistically, like especially compared with

532
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:14,000
other superheroes. Yeah, both of these guys are
kind of one trick ponies as well. Yeah, I mean,

533
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,280
Deathlock has enhanced strength and durability,
but otherwise he just has like a little laser gun

534
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:24,640
and a knife. He should have a better arsenal and
actually the Michael Collins version of

535
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:30,640
Deathlock did. They were mostly tit for tat when it
came to the stats. We gave Jonah Hex the edge when it

536
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:36,920
came to damage level because I've seen him use
dynamite before, essentially. But Deathlock

537
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:42,100
came out ahead and a lot of the physical stats, like
you mentioned, as well as perception. Yeah, but

538
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:47,160
there are even when it came to like range and
actually fighting, which surprised me, Jonah Hex

539
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:51,420
is actually a better fighter than I guess I would
have thought he was, given his backstory. I guess

540
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:58,080
that makes sense. They had similar intellect and
ebasin miss as well. Considering all of this,

541
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:04,400
Jonathan, who's winning this match, who's your
money on and how much money? If I was a betting man, I

542
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:10,720
would put 100 large on the table. 100 large. Is that
like a hundred thousand dollars or is that just a

543
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:16,620
hundred dollars? No, no, I just mean a hundred
dollars. Even though the odds are against me,

544
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:24,160
according to our Instagram poll, 59 percent of the
voters in that poll bet it in favor of Deathlock,

545
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:28,940
essentially. Smart people. They look at a cowboy
and then they look at a zombie cyborg and they're

546
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:33,100
like, yeah, I'm going with the zombie cyborg on
that one. And they know that the Jonah Hex movie

547
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:38,220
sucks. So they know what they're doing. But let's
get the actual results. AG9K, the results,

548
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:44,960
please. Here you are, sir. All right, the winner
between Jonah Hex and Joe Hex. Jonah Hex and

549
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:55,220
Deathlock is Deathlock. Gosh dang it. The
demolisher he won out of a thousand matches, 658

550
00:52:55,220 --> 00:53:02,060
percent of the time, whereas Jonah Hex only won
34.2 percent of the time. In the end, it was

551
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:07,640
Deathlock's enhanced strength and durability
that won him out. Jonah Hex just couldn't compete

552
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:13,100
with that. So I was afraid Deathlock was going to
win. If he did, I did not think it was going to be by

553
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:17,960
that much. He's essentially winning two thirds of
the time, which sucks because like what does

554
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:24,520
Deathlock have going for him? He has a gun and a
knife. Jonah Hex has that and more. He has a cyborg

555
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:31,080
body is what it comes down to. That's overrated. I
guess this means that Jonah Hex couldn't beat

556
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:37,620
Robocop either. Shoot him in the mouth. It's not
that hard. My apologies to all of the Jonah Hex fans

557
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:47,640
out there. This sucks. There are literally dozen
of you. Now, there's more than that. Great job,

558
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:52,780
Marvel fans. Like I said, in an earlier episode
this month, we are going to take the month of

559
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:58,420
November. We're coming back. We're going to close
this gap. I scoffed at the idea at the time, but I am

560
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:04,360
concerned now as you should be, as you should be.
That does it for this duel, guys. AJ9K help close us

next episode is going to be another duel in which we
find out who doing in a fight between Vandal

567
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:49,880
Savage, the immortal DC villain versus Sebastian
Shah, the not quite immortal, but long living and

568
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:55,420
energy absorbing X-Men villain. Look forward to
that next week. But that does it for this episode.

Graves for helping make this podcast possible.
We'll talk to you guys next week up up and away. True

573
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:21,920
believers. The amalgam version of these two
characters would be a cowboy zombie cyborg called

574
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,260
Death Hex.
