00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:28,080
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi, welcome to
the DynaMic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,980
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,960
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin

4
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:45,720
brother, Marvelous Joe. And in lead up to our
review of the Marvel film Thunderbolts, we are

5
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:52,320
doing a team duel where we pit that team against
DC's Watchmen. Yeah, we're not pitting the

6
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,800
traditional Thunderbolts team against the
Watchmen, like the original classics. It's going

7
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,100
to be more in line with the film version of the
Thunderbolts, which is also in line with the most

8
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,640
recent roster in the comics. Basically the idea
here is that we have a bunch of street level heroes

9
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,000
and one super powerful character on the team to
back them up. Yeah, Dr. Manhattan in the century,

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,420
respectively. Exactly. We'll be raking down each
team's histories and the rosters we'll be using

11
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:25,360
later on in this episode. There's no comic book
movie news this week, but as always, we list our

12
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,540
segment times in our episode description, so feel
free to check out the show notes if you want to skip

13
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:35,720
ahead to a particular topic. Our artificially
intelligent duel simulator, AJ9K, has a quick

Thanks AJ9K and thanks to everyone who supports
the podcast, including executive producer Nick

23
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:30,740
Abonto who had a birthday recently. Happy
birthday man, if I could give you one gift from

24
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:37,320
Marvel, it would be the power of the century, but
without the void persona attached to it. Okay, and

25
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:43,480
I'll do you one better. I will give you the power of
Dr. Manhattan. Yeah, blue balls and all. Yeah,

26
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,620
have fun with those. Happy birthday. Guys, be sure
to tune into the other shows in the Dynamite

27
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,440
Podcast Network this week, including the console
Combat Podcast, where hosts John and Dean

28
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,940
simulate battles between popular video game
characters. In yesterday's episode, they

29
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:02,200
speculated on who would win in a fight between
She-Hulk from Ultimate Marvel versus Capcom 3

30
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:08,020
versus The Mask. Over on the Max Destruction
Podcast, hosts Scotty and Gilly pit their

31
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:13,180
favorite action heroes from film and television
against each other. They are on a brief season

32
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:19,200
break currently, so now is the perfect time to get
caught up with their past episodes. And on the

33
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,680
Senjoh World Podcast hosts Zachary Hepburn
speculates on fights between fan favorite anime

34
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,740
and manga characters. On Thursday, Zach is going
to reveal who would win between Sunraku from

35
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:34,300
Shangri-La Frontier versus Kirito from Sword Art
Online. We said that was going to be last week's

36
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:40,220
episode, but Zach had to undergo surgery last
week, so he was able to release the episode and

37
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,980
we're wishing him a speedy recovery. Visit

notes to listen to all the shows in the Dynamite
Podcast Network. But with that out of the way,

39
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:57,140
quick to the No Prize! A No Prize is an award that
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version, the

40
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:02,680
Dynamic duel No Prize, is a digital award we post on
Instagram for the person that we feel gave the best

41
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,980
answer to our question of the week. Last week we
asked you guys, what did you think of the Shalabal

42
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:13,560
Silver Surfer from the Fantastic Four First Steps
official trailer? And we got three answers, so

43
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,120
let's go over our two honorable mentions and the No
Prize winner. Our first honorable mention goes to

44
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,700
Kat Stevenson, who said, Hi guys, this is Kat
Stevenson. I think that the Shalabal in the

45
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:32,300
Fantastic Four First Steps trailer, while it was a
bold choice, I think will ultimately be positive.

46
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,960
I think it'll keep the same people who have been
consistently shitting on James Gunn's Superman

47
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:46,140
away from the film and will help maintain positive
audience reactions to the film. Thanks guys.

48
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:51,980
Yeah, I'm not quite sure what he was saying here in
regards to the Superman film thing, but basically

49
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,620
his answer was it's a bold choice cotton. Let's see
how the strategy pays off for them. What I took this

50
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:03,400
to mean was that so many people are going to be
distracted by the Silver Surfer that's going to be

51
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,880
a positive for DC because they're not going to care
if anything's wrong with that film because

52
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:14,100
they're just going to be so negatively focused on
Fantastic Four and Silver Surfer. No he said it's

53
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:19,340
going to be a positive outcome. Yeah, for DC. Oh.
Yeah, I don't think that's what he meant. Well,

54
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:25,440
that's what I heard. Good answer Kat, our next
honorable mention goes to Gavin Troyer, who said,

55
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:33,480
I don't care if Silver Surfer has boobs or a penis. I
don't even care about bad CGI anymore.

56
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,820
Truthfully, I don't really care about the
Fantastic Four or Silver Surfer that much, but as

57
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:46,260
long as the movie is good, it's good. And it doesn't
really matter what the gender or how good the CGI

58
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:53,160
is. Hopefully the movie is fantastic and that's
all it really needs. All the criteria it needs is to

59
00:05:53,160 --> 00:06:02,440
be fantastic. OK, but what if the Silver Surfer had
boobs and a penis? Well, like Gavin said, I don't

60
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,720
think it would matter if the movie was good. If the
movie is good, then, you know, the sex of the Silver

61
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,860
Surfer is probably going to be the last thing on
anyone's minds. At the end of the day, I think

62
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:18,700
people care more about the overall quality than
any specific, you know, genitalia detail. I don't

63
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:25,040
know about that. I think I would notice silver
genitalia. Great answer, Gavin. But the winner of

64
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:32,680
this week's No Prize is Travis Herndon, who said.
What's up, dynamic do's Travis here. So I'm fine

65
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,980
with a female Silver Surfer. I mean, they've
already established that this is an alternate

66
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:44,340
universe compared to the main MCU universe. And
usually when it comes to multiverses types,

67
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:50,120
situations is always the whole like, oh, hey, this
character might be gender-banned or this

68
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:55,800
character might be race-wild. I mean, we
introduced the multiverse into your story is kind

69
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,940
of expected. That's a great point made by Travis.
And I think why this answer got the No Prize win for

70
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:07,020
this being the multiversal saga as an audience,
we've gotten very little actual multiversal

71
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:14,860
content. And to quote the vision, what is the
multiverse, if not interesting and bold casting

72
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:21,860
choices, persevering? But what? I don't remember
him saying that. I'm paraphrasing. Oh, OK. Well, I

73
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:27,960
mean, Marvel does have a precedence for
gender-bending characters and the multiverse.

74
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:35,220
If you take a look at Captain Carter or Loki or even
Lady Deadpool, we've seen gender-bent versions

75
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:42,840
of heroes we know and love. And since this is a
multiversal character, I could see how people

76
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,980
could be a little bit more forgiving. That being
said, I still stand by what I said last week in that

77
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:53,800
sense. Shalabal is really the only seeming
multiversal component of the Fantastic Four

78
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,400
first steps film other than the time period. It
would have been nice if Marvel chose to go with the

79
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:05,580
Frankie Ray Nova Herald of Galactus instead.
Yeah, 100 percent. I agree with that. Well,

80
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:09,280
congrats to Travis Herndon for winning this
week's No Prize. If you, the listener, want a shot

81
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,080
at winning your own No Prize, stay tuned until
later on this episode when we will be asking

82
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:22,700
another question of the week. And now that that's
done onto the question of the week. Since this

83
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:28,900
episode is a team duel between Watchmen and
Thunderbolts and since Thunderbolts is coming

84
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:36,620
out this week, here's our question. For those of
you who have seen both films, which was better?

85
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:42,980
2009's Watchmen or Thunderbolts and why? Record

in case we include you on the podcast. We'll pick
our favorite answer and award that person a

89
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:08,980
dynamic duel No Prize that will post to Instagram.
Be sure to answer before May 3rd. DC High Volume,

90
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:16,620
Batman. The Dark Knight's definitive DC comic
stories adapted directly for audio for the very

91
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:26,020
first time. Fear. I have to make them afraid. He's
got a motorcycle. Get after him or have you shot?

92
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:33,260
You mean blow up the building? From this moment on,
none of you are safe. New episodes every

93
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:40,960
Wednesday, wherever you get your podcasts. But
now let's go ahead and move on to the main event of

94
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:48,660
this episode, a team duel where we find out who will
win between DC's Watchmen and Marvel's

95
00:09:48,660 --> 00:10:08,620
Thunderbolts. OK, Watchmen versus
Thunderbolts, as we mentioned earlier on in this

96
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:15,860
episode, this is really going to be a team of street
level heroes and one really superpowered

97
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,440
character backing them up. As you may know, with
the characters of Watchmen, none of them have

98
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,600
superpowers except for Dr. Manhattan, since this
is a world where people are essentially dressing

99
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:34,100
up to play superhero rather than actually being a
superhero. Yeah. And with Thunderbolts, if you

100
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:39,560
watch the marketing for the upcoming film, Yelena
Belova describes the team as a bunch of people who

101
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:45,060
punch and shoot stuff. But then there's also the
Sentry, who is on par with Superman, if not

102
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:50,300
stronger. I'm really excited for this matchup. I
never actually thought I would get to do Watchmen

103
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:57,440
as a team duel. Watchmen is one of my favorite DC
stories and highly praised as the greatest

104
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,280
graphic novel of all time. So I'm super pumped for
this matchup. Well, I think the original arc of the

105
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,580
Thunderbolts has also been called the greatest
graphic novel of all time. Shut the hell up by

106
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:14,180
somebody. Me, I mean, like at least I just said it
right now. So technically, yeah, it has been

107
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:20,500
called that. All right, one person. But to explain
the methodology behind our duels, let's go to our

108
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,840
sentient duel simulator, Alfred Jarvis, 9000.
Agent 9K tell our listeners how you go about

109
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:31,640
determining a winner in our team duel matchups.
Yes, of course, sir. The way I determine a winner

110
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,620
between the two teams is by running 1000 Monte
Carlo simulations between every character on

111
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:42,060
each team using their statistics. A Monte Carlo
simulation is a probabilistic model used to

112
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:47,220
determine outcomes through random sampling. In
this case, I randomize the statistics along a

113
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,480
normal distribution as a way to simulate the many
variables that can occur during battle. The stat

114
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,560
parameters are based on the official Marvel power
grid from which the DC characters statistics are

115
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:02,900
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are
included such as range, damage potential,

116
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:08,120
versatility and perception in order to create a
more detailed and accurate simulation. The

117
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,960
results of the 49000 simulations provide a
percentage of wins for each character on both

118
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,660
teams. The team with the higher average win rate is
declared the victor as they have a higher

119
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:22,880
probability to win any given battle. In an
equitable pairing, neither team should win 100

120
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,180
percent of the matches. The comic book stories
have shown that there's even a way for Batman to

121
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:31,720
defeat Superman, so the confidence rate of my
method falls in line with the precedents that have

122
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,740
been established in the source material. My
mathematical simulations are without

123
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:41,400
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for

124
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:47,360
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K.
Before we run the simulations, though, we like to

125
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,500
break down each team's histories and rosters
before improvising a scenario on how we imagine

126
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:59,560
one of the thousands of simulations would play out
beat for beat. And it's my turn to go first with the

127
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:06,220
DC team's backstory. So let me tell you all about
Watchmen. Now, the alternate universe of

128
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:13,160
Watchmen, the costumed adventurers first
emerged during the late 1930s and early 1940s,

129
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:18,960
beginning with the masked vigilante known as
Hooded Justice. His brutal and mysterious

130
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:25,020
activities against criminals inspired the
formation of The Minutemen, a team of eight masked

131
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:30,880
crime fighters, including Silk Spectre, Captain
Metropolis, Duller Bill, Mothman, the

132
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:38,080
Silhouette, Night Owl, the comedian and Hooded
Justice himself. Though publicly celebrated,

133
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,520
internal tensions plagued the group after an
attempted sexual assault by the comedian on Silk

134
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:49,680
Spectre was violently stopped by Hooded Justice,
the comedian was expelled from The Minutemen.

135
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,460
Despite their colorful appearances, the members
of The Minutemen harbored dark secrets and

136
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:59,660
personal flaws, and the team eventually
dissolved under the weight of scandal, tragedy

137
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:06,500
and infighting. Hooded Justice vanished without
a trace in the 1950s. His ultimate fate never

138
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:12,440
publicly confirmed. In the years that followed,
new costumed adventurers emerged. Daniel

139
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:18,340
Dryberg, inspired by the original Night Owl,
adopted the same moniker and operated with high

140
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:24,340
tech gadgetry. Laurie Yospeczyk, the daughter of
the original Silk Spectre, reluctantly took up

141
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:30,620
her mother's mantle as the second Silk Spectre.
Edward Blake, the comedian, continued operating

142
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:36,020
through government sanction, becoming a
hardened and cynical figure who participated in

143
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:42,900
the Vietnam War alongside Dr. Manhattan, who was
formerly John Osterman. He emerged as the first

144
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:47,400
being with true superhuman powers after a
scientific accident disintegrated and

145
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:54,080
reconstituted him as a blue-skinned being who
perceived all of times simultaneously. Adrian

146
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:59,740
Veit, known as Ozzy Mendeus and renowned as the
smartest man alive, rose to prominence with an

147
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:06,420
image of altruism and efficiency, only to retire
and channel his genius into business ventures. In

148
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:12,640
the early 1960s, Captain Metropolis attempted to
reunite the new generation of adventurers under a

149
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:18,320
team called the Crime Busters. The group gathered
for a meeting, but the effort collapsed when the

150
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,140
comedian mocked their idealism and exposed the
futility of costumed heroics in the shadow of

151
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:29,180
nuclear Armageddon. Following this, the
independent operations of the crime fighters

152
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:35,960
continued until in 1977, when the United States
passed the Keen Act, outlawing un-sanctioned

153
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:42,360
vigilanteism. Most heroes retired. Ozzy Mendeus
left the public eye to pursue corporate power.

154
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,820
Dryberg reluctantly stepped down. Dr. Manhattan
and the comedian continued their work as

155
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:53,620
sanctioned government operatives and only
Rorschach refused to comply. Continuing his

156
00:15:53,620 --> 00:16:00,140
crusade illegally. In October 1985, Edward Blake
was thrown from the window of his apartment in New

157
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:05,980
York City. His death initially believed to be an
isolated homicide. Through the attention of

158
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,940
Rorschach, who uncovered Blake's secret
identity as the comedian, convinced that someone

159
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:16,940
was targeting masked heroes. Rorschach visited
his former colleagues, Daniel Dryberg, Laurie

160
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:23,200
Yospechik, Dr. Manhattan and Adrian Weitz.
Though most of them dismissed his warnings, the

161
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:28,340
seeds of suspicion were planted. Blake's funeral
brought the surviving former heroes together.

162
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:33,640
Dryberg, Weitz and Manhattan attended, each
reflecting under complicated relationships

163
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:39,480
with Blake. Shortly after the funeral, Dr.
Manhattan was publicly accused of causing cancer

164
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:45,540
among his former associates. Shocked by the
allegations and humanity's sudden rejection,

165
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:51,200
Manhattan exiled himself to Mars. With the
departure of their superhuman deterrent, the

166
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:56,680
Soviet Union seized the opportunity to invade
Afghanistan, escalating global tensions

167
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,700
towards nuclear war. Weitz narrowly survived an
assassination attempt for their convincing

168
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:08,300
Rorschach that a conspiracy was afoot.
Meanwhile, Laurie, disillusioned with her life

169
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:13,960
alongside the increasingly detached Dr.
Manhattan, grew closer to Dryberg. The two

170
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,859
eventually donned their costumes once more,
rekindling their sense of purpose as vigilantes

171
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:24,079
and rescuing residents from a burning apartment
building. Their renewed partnership deepened

172
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:29,780
into romance. Rorschach, continuing his
investigation, was framed for the murder of the

173
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:35,820
former villain, Mollick, and was captured by
police after a violent struggle. In prison, he was

174
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:41,200
subjugated to attacks from fellow inmates, but he
defended himself with ruthless efficiency,

175
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:47,460
culminating in a cafeteria scalding and the
brutal murder of a crime boss. Meanwhile, Dryberg

176
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,040
and Yospechek, believing Rorschach's
conspiracy theory had merit, executed a daring

177
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:58,300
plan to break him out of prison during a massive
riot. While Dryberg and Rorschach investigated

178
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:04,640
further, Dr. Manhattan transported Laurie to
Mars. There, Laurie pleaded with him to save

179
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,440
humanity from impending doom. Initially
unmoved, Manhattan reconsidered after Laurie's

180
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,840
revelation that she was the daughter of the
comedian, the product of a complex and painful

181
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:21,820
relationship between her mother and Blake.
Seeing the improbability and beauty of human

182
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,820
existence, Manhattan agreed to return to Earth.
During investigation, led Dryberg and Rorschach

183
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:33,520
to suspect Adrian Veit as the masked killer,
following a trail of evidence they traveled to

184
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:39,420
Antarctica to confront him in his private base,
where Veit revealed his plan to save humanity from

185
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:45,520
nuclear annihilation by staging an alien
invasion that would decimate New York City. By

186
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,120
uniting the United States and the Soviet Union
against a perceived extraterrestrial threat,

187
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,460
you believed he could avert global war. Veit
admitted to orchestrating the cancer scare to

188
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:02,080
drive Dr. Manhattan away, staging the attempt on
his own life to eliminate suspicion, murdering

189
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,800
Blake when he uncovered the plot and framing
Rorschach to impede his investigation. As

190
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,740
Dryberg and Rorschach reeled from the
revelation, Veit disclosed that his plan had

191
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:19,140
already been enacted. In New York, millions lay
dead amid the wreckage caused by the appearance of

192
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:24,920
the genetically engineered psychic creature, a
colossal sized squid that was teleported into the

193
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:30,440
city. News reports confirmed that the United
States and Soviet Union had entered talks to unite

194
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,740
against the supposed alien menace. Manhattan and
Lorry arrived on Earth and traveled to

195
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:41,280
Antarctica, confronting Veit. Although
appalled by the slaughter, the heroes realized

196
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:47,660
that exposing the truth would only reignite the
threat of nuclear war. All except Rorschach

197
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:53,760
agreed to keep silence. Rorschach refused to
compromise. As he departed into the frozen

198
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,800
wasteland to reveal the truth, he encountered Dr.
Manhattan and he demanded to be killed rather than

199
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:06,160
be silenced by any other means. Without a word,
Manhattan complied, disintegrating Rorschach.

200
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:11,540
Following the confrontation, Dryberg and Lorry
adopted new identities, leaving behind their

201
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:17,320
former lives. Meanwhile, back in New York, the
right wing newspaper New Frontiersman received

202
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:22,920
Rorschach's journal detailing his
investigation and suspicions into Adrian, its

203
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:28,060
contents poised to expose the entire truth,
depending on the editor's decision. Dr.

204
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:34,380
Manhattan, disillusioned by humanities and less
cycles, left Earth to explore new galaxies.

205
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:40,600
Adrian Veit, victorious, yet uncertain, was left
to wonder about the consequences of his actions.

206
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,680
Years after the devastation in New York City, the
world uncovered the truth behind Adrian Veit's

207
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:51,040
deception when Rorschach's journal was finally
published. Rather than uniting humanity

208
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:56,360
indefinitely, the revelation reignited
distrust and chaos among the nations. In

209
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:02,140
desperation, Veit sought to locate Dr.
Manhattan, believing only he could repair the

210
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:08,060
world he had broken. Tracking residuel quantum
traces across dimensions, Veit crossed into a

211
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:14,200
parallel Earth where superheroes had long shaped
history differently. There, he manipulated a

212
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:20,240
successor to Rorschach, Reginald Long,
convincing him to assist in the search. Edward

213
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,960
Blake, the comedian whose death Veit had once
orchestrated, was pulled from the moment of his

214
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,380
murder and brought into this new world by Dr.
Manhattan's intervention. Now alive again,

215
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:37,520
Blake hunted Veit for revenge, while also
becoming entangled in violent conflicts between

216
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:43,140
metahuman factions. Dr. Manhattan, observing
this world, had been subtly reshaping its

217
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,920
history. Intrigued by the resilience of its
greatest hero, Superman, Manhattan had

218
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:54,400
experimented with removing key figures and
altering pivotal moments, shifting the

219
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,200
emergence of heroes and the world's timeline.
Yet, despite his manipulations, Manhattan found

220
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,220
himself unable to see beyond a looming
confrontation with Superman, uncertain whether

221
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:12,500
he would destroy this reality or be destroyed by
it. Adrian Veit, recognizing the instability Dr.

222
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,840
Manhattan's presence created, attempted once
more to engineer peace by igniting a global

223
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:24,420
metahuman arms race and framing Superman as a
threat. His plans ultimately unraveled as the

224
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:30,620
truth surfaced aided by heroes from this new earth
who resisted further deception. In the final

225
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:36,440
confrontation, Superman's unwavering hope
inspired Dr. Manhattan to abandon his cold

226
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:43,140
detachment. Rather than destroy or dominate the
world, Manhattan restored what he had broken,

227
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:48,880
returning lost heroes to existence and ensuring
the survival of those he had once endangered. Veit

228
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,700
was returned to his own world, exposed for his
crimes and imprisoned, accepting that he had no

229
00:22:54,700 --> 00:23:01,900
place in this world. Manhattan entrusted his
power to a child he had raised, a boy he named Clark,

230
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:07,180
whom he gave to Daniel Dryberg and Laura Yospechik
to raise before Manhattan vanished from

231
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:13,380
existence. Clark grew up to become the superhero
known as the Watchman. And that's the full history

232
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:19,320
of the Watchman characters. Now, for my seven
member Watchman roster, I am, of course, going

233
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:25,080
with the six main characters of the Watchman
story, including Rorschach, Silk Spectre and the

234
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:30,180
Comedian, none of whom who have superhuman
powers, but are skilled fighters and possess

235
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:36,380
various crime fighting tools and weapons. Ozzy
Mandius, also included on this team, possesses

236
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:41,920
near superhuman abilities, as he is the most
intelligent and most physically capable human

237
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:48,680
man in existence. Dr. Manhattan, as my sixth
member, is the powerhouse of the team, possessing

238
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,580
nine missions and omnipotence, whom you've
learned more about in our Dr. Manhattan versus

239
00:23:53,580 --> 00:24:00,940
Molecule Man episode. For my seventh and final
member, I decided to go with Hooded Justice, as he

240
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:06,080
was the very first superhero in Watchman Comics
and is an accomplished fighter and stealth

241
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:12,260
expert. But who watches the Watchman? Your mom?
Yeah, I think she's seen that movie. You're right.

242
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:18,440
You're right. I got to say that the subsequent
rebirth DC universe aspects of these characters

243
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,400
history didn't really hold a candle to the
original Watchman story. No, and I don't think it

244
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:29,200
really holds a candle to what they did with the
Watchman television series. In my opinion, that

245
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:35,880
is the superior sequel to the Watchman story,
particularly when it comes to also the history of

246
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:41,520
certain characters like Hooded Justice. But
that's not comics canon. Yeah, if DC was smart,

247
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:46,720
they would actually serialize the Watchman
television show from HBO, put it into a comic book

248
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:52,360
format and then make it an official sequel. I might
be too late for that, but it's fine. Well, at least

249
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,620
Marvel has the synergy going with this new team
that's going to be in the Thunderbolts movie. But

250
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:01,460
let me take you back to the beginning of the comic
book history. The Thunderbolts were founded

251
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:07,000
after a battle with Onslaught left the world
without the Avengers or Fantastic Four. Seizing

252
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,280
the opportunity, Baron Zemo assembled a new team
of villains from the Masters of Evil group now

253
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:17,780
posing as heroes. Vidal, Fixer, Goliath,
Moonstone and Screaming Mimi, who adopted the new

254
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:23,360
identities of Mach 1, Techno, Atlas, Moonstone
and Songbird. You can learn more about the Masters

255
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,100
of Evil in their team duel against the Legion of
Doom. The Thunderbolts debuted to public

256
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:34,180
acclaim, even inspiring young heroine Jolt, who
joined the team unaware of their deception. After

257
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:39,400
the Avengers and the Fantastic Four returned,
Zemo accelerated his plans, publicly exposing

258
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:44,180
the Thunderbolts true identities to destroy
their chances at redemption and solidify their

259
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:49,620
loyalty to him. Zemo attempted to enslave the
global population with a mind control device, but

260
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:54,480
the team, having genuinely embraced heroism,
turned against him, freeing the mind controlled

261
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,800
populace. Zemo fled while the remaining
Thunderbolts, now fugitives, struggled to earn

262
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,760
back the trust they had betrayed. Better an
Avenger Hawkeye than joined and led the team,

263
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:10,240
boosting their credibility. He convinced Mach 1
to serve jail time for past crimes, solidifying

264
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,580
the team's commitment to change. Under Hawkeye,
the Thunderbolts defeated the new Masters of

265
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:20,100
Evil, gained the headquarters, and earned
government support. After exposing Henry

266
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:25,340
Guyridge's anti-superhuman conspiracy, they
were officially pardoned. Later, during a battle

267
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:30,860
with Graviton, several Thunderbolts, including
Fixer, Jolt and Songbird, were hurled to counter

268
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:36,060
Earth, which was a parallel world created by
Franklin Richards, the son of Mr. Fantastic and

269
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:41,400
Invisible Woman. There, they worked with Baron
Zemo to stabilize the devastated planet.

270
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,040
Meanwhile, Hawkeye formed a second Thunderbolts
team to combat Crimson Cowell's forces.

271
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,900
Meanwhile, Hawkeye formed a second Thunderbolts
team to combat Crimson Cowell's forces. After

272
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,740
various battles in the return of the original team
from counter Earth, the Thunderbolts merged into

273
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:01,820
one group. Zemo seized control, convincing some
members to follow his vision of saving the world

274
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,760
through domination. His Thunderbolts clashed
with the Avengers and were ultimately defeated,

275
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:12,240
fracturing the team. Original members Mock Four,
Songbird and Atlas later revived the

276
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,820
Thunderbolts with new recruits like Joystick,
Rizzard, Speed Demon and Radioactive Man. This

277
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:23,400
era saw them battle against Hydra and the Purple
Man, who tried to enslave New York. Zemo secretly

278
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:57,780
manipulated a Formerly the Green Goblin, soon
assumed leadership of the new Thunderbolts

279
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:03,240
lineup. You can learn more about him in his duel
against the Joker. Characters like Songbird,

280
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,500
Moonstone, Bullseye, Venom, Penance, and
Swordsman operated as a sanctioned strike team

281
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:13,580
capturing unregistered heroes. Despite public
success, internal betrayal and corruption

282
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:18,380
riddled the team. Osborn manipulated events
during the Skrull invasion positioning himself

283
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,340
as the national hero known as Iron Patriot. Under
Osborn, the Thunderbolts became a covert

284
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:29,220
assassination squad known as the Dark Avengers.
New members included White Widow, Yelena Baloba,

285
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:34,580
who was actually Natasha Romanoff in disguise,
Ant-Man, and Ghost. Missions ranged from

286
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:39,040
targeting Deadpool to seizing weapons for Masked
Guard during Osborn's campaign against the realm

287
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:44,180
after it manifested on Earth. After Osborn's
fall, Luke Cage took over the Thunderbolts

288
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:50,840
program. The team included Songbird, Mach 5,
Ghost, Moonstone, Juggernaut, Crossbones,

289
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:55,840
Hyperion, and Manthing. Operating from the Raft
prison, this version aimed at rehabilitating

290
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,600
villains, though tensions and betrayals
remained. Crossbones and Hyperion were expelled

291
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,980
after betraying the team, and Satan had joined to
defend against magical threats. The team was

292
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:12,100
later lost in time, battling through World War II,
Camelot, and a dystopian future before returning

293
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:17,480
to the present and then disbanding. Later,
General Thaddeus, Thunderbolt Ross, now Red

294
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:23,630
Hulk, formed his own Thunderbolt strike team with
Deadpool, Electra, Agent Venom, Punisher, and

295
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:27,940
eventually Ghost Rider. Operating outside
government control, they confronted threats

296
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:33,920
like Madman, Gamma-irradiated Crimson Dynamos,
and even travel to Hell. The team fractured after a

297
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:38,660
brutal internal conflict between Punisher and
Red Hulk, which was partly orchestrated by the

298
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:44,400
villain known as the Leader. James Bucky Barnes,
aka the Winter Soldier, assembled a new

299
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:50,000
Thunderbolt squad, including original members
Fixer, Atlas, Moonstone, and Mach 10. The mission

300
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,900
was to prevent Shield from abusing the sentient
cosmic cube, Cobyc. During this time, they

301
00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:00,340
battled alien invaders, the squadron Supreme,
and a secretly fascist Captain America. Songbird

302
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:05,120
briefly reunited with the team before it
disbanded, following attacks by Baron Zemo and

303
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,440
the Masters of Evil. Subsequently, Zemo
organized a Thunderbolt's team during his

304
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,900
vendetta against the Punisher. His roster
included Ghost, Moonstone, Radioactive Man,

305
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:21,080
Fixer, and Jigsaw. Their efforts to trap and kill
Frank Castle failed after Ghost turned against

306
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:27,280
Zemo. The Kingpin, as Mayor of New York later
formed his own Thunderbolt's task force led by

307
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:32,980
Taskmaster to fight the evil deity Null's
invasion of the city. After being hunted by Null's

308
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,840
shadowy forces, the team made their way to the
Ravencroft Institute, where they teamed with

309
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:43,800
Norman Osborn to use the Sentry against Null's
symbiote base. After Null's eventual defeat,

310
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:48,800
which you can learn more about in his duel against
DC's White Lantern, Kingpin continued using the

311
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:54,620
Thunderbolts, now led by a US agent to crack down on
Vigilantism. Following Fisk's downfall as

312
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:59,800
Mayor, the newly elected Luke Cage restructured
the Thunderbolts and placed Hawkeye in charge

313
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:05,560
with a new lineup featuring Photon, Miss America,
and Power Man. This team successfully defended

314
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:10,060
New York from several threats, but was
short-lived. Meanwhile, the Winter Soldier and

315
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:15,180
former Shield agent Contessa Valentina Allegra
de Fontaine assembled a separate Thunderbolts

316
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:21,620
team to dismantle Red Skull's global operations.
Red Guardian, White Widow, Black Widow, Sharon

317
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:28,100
Carter, Shang Chi, and US agent joined the cause.
They succeeded in defeating the Red Skull after a

318
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:33,940
battle in Laferia, involving Dr. Doom. And that's
the Thunderbolts backstory. For this team duel's

319
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:38,360
7-person roster, I'm going with mostly members
from the most recent iteration of the comic book

320
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:43,180
team, which largely coincides with the roster in
the Thunderbolts movie, which comes out this

321
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:47,640
week. Yes, it did destroy me that we're not
including any members of the original

322
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:53,480
Thunderbolts team here, including people like
Baron Zemo, Mach 1, Songbird, Atlas, Moonstone,

323
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,660
and Techno. No one is more upset by this than me,
because I think the original Thunderbolts

324
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:04,140
storyline up through Hawkeye's leadership of the
group is just classic Marvel storytelling that no

325
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:09,360
other iteration of the team has been able to match.
But as we said earlier, when we realized that the

326
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,840
film's Thunderbolts roster could potentially
make for a good duel against the Watchmen, we just

327
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,640
saw an opportunity that we couldn't pass up. So
representing the Thunderbolts are the Winter

328
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:24,060
Soldier, who has led two separate versions of the
team, Taskmaster, who served on three iterations

329
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:31,380
and even led the team once, Ghost, a three-time
Thunderbolts member, US Agent, who has served on

330
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:37,480
the Thunderbolts twice and led once, White Widow,
who was involved in two incarnations of the team,

331
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:42,600
Red Guardian, who was a more recent recruit, and
finally, the Sentry, who was never actually a

332
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:47,500
Thunderbolts member but who was a part of Norman
Osborn's Dark Avengers, which was a team that spun

333
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:52,020
out of the Thunderbolts. Each of these characters
has had their own duel episode for listeners to

334
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:58,260
learn more about them, except for Ghost and Red
Guardian. Ghost was a brilliant data engineer who

335
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:02,600
developed quantum computing chips that could
phase out of existence to bypass the physical

336
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:07,000
limitations of the real world, such as
overheating. When he was betrayed by the company

337
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,260
he worked for, he integrated the technology into a
suit that could render him both invisible and

338
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:16,780
intangible. After killing his company's
executives, he became a corporate saboteur for

339
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:21,600
hire. He clashed with Iron Man on multiple
occasions before being drafted into the

340
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:27,300
Thunderbolts. Ghost's suit also renders him
completely silent, able to zap others or disrupt

341
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:33,120
electronics with an electric touch, able to
interface with technology, and able to float. Of

342
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,300
course, the comic version is very different than
the MCU's version, who is Ava Star, the daughter of

343
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:43,860
the Ant-Man villain Egghead. Now Red Guardian's
real name is Alexi Shostakov, whom I discussed

344
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:49,280
briefly in our Black Canary vs Black Widow Duel
episode. In the comics, he is a former Soviet pilot

345
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:54,800
and husband of Black Widow. His death was faked by
the KGB in order to turn him into a special

346
00:33:54,800 --> 00:34:00,440
operative. Russia is answered to Captain
America, called Red Guardian. He was often pit

347
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:05,280
against his American rival and later against his
ex-wife, when she defected from Russia and joined

348
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,380
the Avengers. Red Guardian later defected
himself, and often teamed up with White Widow

349
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:16,340
against the Red Room. He wields a circular shield
and carries smaller discs on his belt that he can

350
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:21,639
use as throwing projectiles. That's the team. To
reiterate, my Thunderbolts roster is Winter

351
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:28,400
Soldier, Taskmaster, Ghost, US Agent, White
Widow, Red Guardian, and Sentry. Right, and when

352
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:34,380
we're formulating rosters with our executive
producers, we like to pair up these characters

353
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:41,719
just to make sure that they are evenly matched, or
as evenly matched as we can get. In this case, Red

354
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:48,440
Guardian is pairing up with Hooded Justice, White
Widow with Comedian, Ghost with Silk Spectre,

355
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:55,360
Taskmaster with Ozzy Mandias, Winter Soldier
with Night Owl, US Agent with Rorschach, and of

356
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,820
course, Sentry with Dr. Manhattan. Yeah, one of
the main differences between the two teams is that

357
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:07,380
the watchmen are going to get served justice like
lightning. Okay. And if you didn't know, that is

358
00:35:07,380 --> 00:36:08,480
the Thunderbolts tagline. So, yeah. But now that
we've got the team's histories and rosters out of

359
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,200
the way, we're going to speculate on how one of the
thousands of simulated matches will go. The

360
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:17,660
winner is determined by simulations, not the
speculation, but it's fun to imagine how the fight

361
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:23,140
could play out. Agent I.K., what are the rules over
speculation? Well, I should say there are no

362
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:27,980
rules, other than the teams have no prior
knowledge of the other going into the fight. All

363
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:33,080
they are aware of starting out is that the other
side is a threat that needs to be eliminated. For

364
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,660
the speculation, the groups will begin
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript

365
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:42,720
environment that will have no bearing on the match
itself, as no environmental statistics are

366
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:48,160
considered in my simulations. The teams must earn
victory on their own merit. All right, then, let's

367
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,620
get into it. The watchmen and the Thunderbolts
meet on the battlefield, which team goes first?

368
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:59,700
Actually, I'm going to say that because Dr.
Manhattan already knows how this match is going to

369
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:07,220
play out and end, he's going to start by causing
this colossal labyrinth of reflective glass and

370
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:14,320
clockwork gears to rise up from the ground around
them. And so now the teams have to fight through

371
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:20,720
this MC Escher-esque hall of mirrors. That's
pretty cool, but the Thunderbolts are going to be

372
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:28,500
like, what the hell is this? How is this fair? And
why is that blue guy's dick out? And Red Guardian is

373
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,080
going to be like, should I pull my dick out? And
everybody's going to be like, that's gross. Don't

374
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:36,960
do that. But I'm going to say the century starts off
by he's just going to tear through the clockwork

375
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,880
tower, like shattering some parts of it, melting
parts of it down. So everything is basically

376
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,400
falling apart around them. And as this glass
structure gets torn down, Winter Soldier

377
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,240
suddenly gets a clear shot with his sniper rifle
through a hole in the glass, and he just shoots

378
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:56,660
Comedian right in his side. Actually, though,
that was just a reflection of the Comedian. So

379
00:37:56,660 --> 00:38:02,560
Winter Soldier really just shoots through glass
and now he's given away his location to the real

380
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:10,190
Comedian to return to the favor by launching a
grenade from his rifle at the Winter Soldier. And

381
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:14,300
that's going to cause his good arm to get blown
right off. No, no, no, no, because as the grenade

382
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:19,920
comes in, it's just going to bounce off of US
agents' shield and blow up another part of the

383
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,820
glass tower. I think by this point, like at least
half of the structure is already gone. So White

384
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:30,860
Widow grapples up to the highest point that's
still around. And she's going to shoot down a gas

385
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:36,700
pellet that covers Rorschach and Hooded Justice
in tear gas smoke, and they're not able to breathe

386
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:42,860
and they're incapacitated. You literally chose
the two characters who both have mouth coverings

387
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:52,480
to filter their air. No, it would affect them more.
I don't think it would. Oh, shit, did I fuck up?

388
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,580
Rorschach, you know, he's going to see where the
tear gas came from and he's going to use his

389
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:02,660
grappling gun to zip up to where White Widow is, at
which point he's going to attack her with a broken

390
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:08,780
shot of glass that he collected down below and he's
just going to slice right into her neck. There's no

391
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:13,320
way. Like White Widow is going to block this slash
attack and then she's going to punch Rorschach

392
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,140
right in the face and then she's going to look at his
mask and she's going to be like, I think I see a bitch

393
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:23,000
and she's going to rent house, kick him right off
the glass tower where he lands on some spiky glass

394
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:29,860
debris down below and dies. What? Damn. OK, he's
probably going to call her a whore as he falls to his

395
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:38,640
death. Right in front of Night Owl, who's like, no.
And so he's going to grapple up to his Archie Owl

396
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:46,000
ship and use its sonic emitters to shatter the
glass tower that White Widow is in. So she also

397
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,680
falls to her death. I said that you couldn't use
Archie in the course of this battle. I'm sorry.

398
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,860
Why? For the same reason I said you couldn't use the
bug ship in the Blue Beetle duel episode. And yet I

399
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:04,560
did. And it's not fair to do one and not the other. So
suck it. Meanwhile, back in the match, Hooded

400
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:11,720
Justice has Red Guardian panties to the ground in a
wrestling chokehold. OK. And Red Guardian is

401
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:18,960
going to be like, why is the guy fighting me have an
erection? What is with this team? And he's going to

402
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:23,980
be rescued by USA agent who curls his shield at
Hooded Justice's head, which is going to cause him

403
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:29,520
to lose his grip on Red Guardian. And Red Guardian,
he's going to get up and he throws his shield at

404
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,300
Hooded Justice to in retaliation for the
chokehold. And then, you know what? Just to get it

405
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:38,020
on the action, Taskmaster also throws his shield
at Hooded Justice. So that's three different

406
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:43,100
shields being thrown at him. Hooded Justice is
looking like a pinball here and he's knocked out of

407
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:48,760
this match. No one's taken three shields to the
face and living to tell about it. OK, that seemed

408
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:55,960
unnecessary. Let's say Silk Spectre and Ghost are
battling get out elsewhere in this match. But, you

409
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:02,260
know, even with ghosts, phasing abilities, Silk
Spectre is one of the best trained fighters in the

410
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:09,240
watchmen world. So she's able to time her attacks
perfectly and land several debilitating blows

411
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:15,700
against a ghost that would never happen. If
anything, Ghost is probably just going to have

412
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:21,000
some fun, like frustrating Silk Spectre as she
tries to land hit after hit after hit and just

413
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:25,940
getting air each time. And then Ghost is just going
to turn invisible. And Silk Spectre is wondering

414
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:31,580
where the hell he's gone. When all of a sudden Ghost
appears behind her and straight up tases her in the

415
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:37,340
neck and she drops to the floor like a wet sack. So
Silk Spectre is out of this match now. For my

416
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:45,100
tasing? Yeah, she's incapacitated. OK, well,
this whole time, Ozymandias has been hiding in

417
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:51,440
the labyrinth, just observing the thunder bolts.
And through his powers of deduction, he's noticed

418
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:58,920
that the Russian technology of the winter
soldier's bionic arm doesn't match his accent. So

419
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:05,540
he assumes he is a kidnapped, brainwashed
assassin. And having read about Russian

420
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:12,060
brainwashing techniques, Ozymandias quickly
speaks Bucky's code words to take control of him.

421
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:17,820
And he has Bucky's snap red guardians neck killing
him. Well, you're thinking of the movies here,

422
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:22,600
like in the books, there were no code words. If I
remember correctly, it was just he was controlled

423
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:28,040
by the Russians through mind implants. But we'll
say that, yeah, sure. Somehow Ozymandias knew

424
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,280
something about Russia manipulation
techniques, at least enough to take advantage of

425
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:38,960
them. All right, cool. Yeah. So the winter soldier
is his agent now, and he killed Red Guardian. But

426
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,000
whatever Ozymandias can do, Taskmaster can
copy. So as the US agent and ghost are like

427
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:49,140
defending themselves from Bucky's gunfire,
Taskmaster is going to just run his sword through

428
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:55,180
Ozymandias and pailing him and killing him and
then using the same Russian techniques to bring

429
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:59,860
the winter soldier back onto the Thunderbolt
side. No, no, no, because Ozymandias had

430
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:07,060
observed Taskmaster as well and also deduced his
ability to mimic physical abilities. So as

431
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:13,320
Taskmaster attacks him, Ozymandias just
sidesteps and catches the blade of Taskmaster's

432
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:19,280
sword between his palms. And with one fluid
motion, Ozymandias disarms and impales

433
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:25,120
Taskmaster on his own sword. OK, so you're telling
me that Ozymandias not only still has winter

434
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:30,460
soldier under his control, but he also just took
out Taskmaster. That's right. Well, it's pretty

435
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:37,420
dang strong. I'm going to say by this point, Ghost
has floated up to Archie, Night Owl's ship, and he

436
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:42,600
uses his ghost tech to shut down all of Archie's
electrical systems and Night Owl has no idea

437
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:48,140
what's going on because Ghost is invisible and
inaudible. So Night Owl ejects from the ship as it

438
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:54,740
falls from the sky. But Ghost manages to steer it
right into Ozymandias, who's like, oh, shit, I

439
00:43:54,740 --> 00:44:00,880
didn't see this coming. And then he gets fined into
the world's smartest pancake. OK, sure. Night

440
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:07,320
Owl, he's going to glide down from the sky
silently. And he aims right for US agent doing a

441
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:14,220
gliding double kick right into his spine, causing
US agent to topple forward. And Night Owl is

442
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:20,520
quickly going to follow up by hurling a crescent
blade right into US agent's neck. No, not only does

443
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:25,520
US agent block this crescent blade with his
shield, he's going to rush over and then straight

444
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,620
up shield uppercut Night Owl's head. Right off his
body, because, you know, he has like 10 ton level

445
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:37,460
strength. What the heck? All right. Well, this is
when US agent suddenly gets hosed down by the

446
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:43,700
comedian's flamethrower, just setting him
ablaze. And while US agent is dying, comedian

447
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:49,620
turns his attention to Winter Soldier, who's
coming out of Ozymandias's brainwashing, all

448
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:56,140
confused. And the comedian snipes him right in the
head. No, I think Winter Soldier is less confused

449
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:02,000
than you think. Like he snaps out of Ozymandias's
brainwashing and straight up catches comedian's

450
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:07,280
bullet with his metal arm. And then without
missing a beat with his other arm, he just flings a

451
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,500
throwing knife that flacks right into comedian's
forehead. Dude, I said comedian snaped him. He was

452
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:20,660
far away. Winter Soldier could throw a knife that
hard, that fast, that far. Yeah. OK. So what? All I

453
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:27,460
have left is Dr. Manhattan. Oh, no. Whatever.
Psych. Dr. Manhattan is going to split himself

454
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:34,700
into three duplicates and one's going to teleport
over to ghost and turn him into steam. And another

455
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:40,780
one's going to go to US agent. Just turn him to
Mercury. And the third one, he's going to teleport

456
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:47,180
over to Winter Soldier and turn him into
snowflakes. Wow. Easy peasy. And then he's going

457
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:54,700
to re merge into one giant being that's going to
snatch the century right out of the air. And, you

458
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:59,760
know, maybe taking a second to study his
photosynthetic physiology. He's just going to

459
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:05,880
straight up turn him into a black hole. Match over.
I win. OK. I'm going to say that Dr. Manhattan meant

460
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:11,020
to turn century into a black hole. But what he
actually accidentally did was bring out the

461
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:16,780
centuries void persona. So this like black hole
that Dr. Manhattan created, it actually develops

462
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:22,280
like this dark smile and shoots at a bunch of dark
tendrils that embed themselves into Dr.

463
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:29,340
Manhattan and they just explode him like a nuclear
bomb. No, Dr. Manhattan would have seen this

464
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:34,520
coming, though. No, no, no, because there were
tachyons. Right. Created by the mini black hole

465
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:40,580
that was actually the void. And then when Dr.
Manhattan exploded like a nuclear bomb, like,

466
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:45,400
yeah, there were tachyons. And, you know, all the
science stuff. So he couldn't see it. Sorry.

467
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:52,760
You're just saying words. OK. Actually, you know
what? There was a nuclear bomb explosion. So as the

468
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:58,500
voids embedding itself in Dr. Manhattan, let's
say suddenly this bright light crackles between

469
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:06,280
them just as a massive alien squid suddenly
explodes onto the scene, not only blowing up the

470
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:12,020
void and Manhattan, but also invading their minds
with like disturbing psychic energy that

471
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:19,360
literally shatters their minds. And how how did
this happen when Ghost crashed Archie into

472
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:26,560
Ozymandias at the last second? He leaped through
one of Archie's giant eye windows and then he

473
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:31,960
rewired and rebooted the ship's technology to
send a signal back to bite industries and putting

474
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,640
coordinates for where his squid alien should
appear and detonate. He probably knew he wouldn't

475
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:42,320
survive the explosion, but he knew that Dr.
Manhattan could by reconstituting himself

476
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:48,120
afterward, giving his side the wind. Except, you
know, that the century would also regenerate from

477
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:53,560
this, not just Dr. Manhattan. So that would work.
Yeah. OK, well, you know, Dr. Manhattan would

478
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:59,860
regenerate first, so we still win. I don't think
so, but we can go ahead and leave the match there.

479
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:06,420
Either Dr. Manhattan regenerates from
Ozymandias's giant squid explosion first or the

480
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:11,600
century regenerates first. Let's go ahead and
find out which scenario happens by inputting the

481
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:18,660
stats on these teams, running the simulations and
coming back with the winning team. AJ9K, hit it.

482
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:24,640
Inputting data, running calculations,
processing results, simulations complete. All

483
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:29,620
right, this is quite the fun pairing, mostly
because putting in the stats for the more street

484
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:35,860
level characters was funny compared to the more
god level power characters. Yeah, it was not even

485
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:44,600
close. Dr. Manhattan won a whopping 97.8 percent
of his matches against the entire Thunderbolts

486
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:51,500
team. It was funny because it's rare that we ever
get a zero win rate percentage, but it happened for

487
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:55,940
the first time in the course of this match. There
were several Thunderbolts characters who

488
00:48:55,940 --> 00:49:02,060
literally stood a zero percent chance of
defeating Dr. Manhattan. Yeah, he was by far the

489
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:07,560
most powerful character on either of our teams.
Now, the century, obviously, was your most

490
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:13,020
powerful character. Yeah, and there were some
watchmen characters that the century beat, like,

491
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:19,220
99.9 percent of the time. So his overall win rate
ended up being 84.3 percent. It would have been

492
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:24,000
damn near close to 100 if it wasn't for Dr.
Manhattan. It was interesting seeing how the

493
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:29,500
overall stat categories compared across each
team, especially with things like evasiveness.

494
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:35,640
Like the Thunderbolts were way more evasive than
the watchmen, largely because US agent has a

495
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:42,580
shield, taskmaster has a shield, red guardian has
a shield, ghost is fucking intangible and

496
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:48,280
invisible. So the Thunderbolts just dominated in
that category. Yeah, the only stat where the

497
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:54,780
street level watchmen characters really shined
in was fighting skill. They're all pretty good

498
00:49:54,780 --> 00:50:01,400
fighters. And next to Dr. Manhattan, my most
impressive character was actually Night Owl. I

499
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:08,360
thought it was going to be Ozzy Madius, but with the
Archie Owl ship that really leveled up Night Owl in

500
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:13,220
terms of his stats. I mean, yeah, the watchmen were
good fighters, but the Thunderbolts were also

501
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:18,300
really good fighters. That's fair. And you guys
were also much more versatile than the watchmen as

502
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:24,800
well. I had the most powerful character, but I also
had the two weakest characters in Silk Spectre and

503
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:30,100
Hooded Justice. Yeah, my weakest character was
actually Ghost, who does great in terms of

504
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:35,740
evasiveness, but wasn't really impressive in any
other stat category, except for intelligence and

505
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:41,340
versatility. Yeah, Ghost as your weakest
character had a win rate of thirty six point five

506
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:49,080
percent, whereas my lowest win rate of fourteen
point six percent belonged to Silk Spectre. So we

507
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:53,160
got a nice little trade off here going basically,
Jonathan, you have the character with the highest

508
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:58,320
win rate, but you also have the characters with the
lowest win rate. My best win rate doesn't match Dr.

509
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:04,180
Manhattan's, but also I don't go as low as fourteen
point six percent like you did. So that all said,

510
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:09,340
which team do you think came out on top? Well, it's
kind of hard to say. I think it's going to be the

511
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:15,720
Thunderbolts, because even though Dr. Manhattan
is statistically better than the Sentry, I think

512
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:22,180
that the rest of the team is far superior to the
Watchmen. Although Instagram does not agree with

513
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:29,640
me in the poll that we put up prior to recording this
episode, 69 percent of the poll takers sided with

514
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:35,580
the Watchmen. And I'm not surprised because
Watchmen is way cooler than Thunderbolts and

515
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:43,800
everybody knows it. But did Watchmen get the win? A
JNNK, the results, please. Here you are, sir. The

516
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:55,980
winning team in our matchup between the Watchmen
and Thunderbolts is. Thunderbolts, that's

517
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:05,040
right. What did I say? Justice like lightning.
They won an even 57 percent of their matches

518
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:11,440
compared to Watchmen who only won 43, which is
actually a pretty decent showing for the

519
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:17,480
Watchmen. Right. Now, I guarantee you that Dr.
Manhattan got all their wins for them almost

520
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:23,820
literally. Yeah. But still decent showing. I
don't understand this considering the fact that

521
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:30,080
at the start of each match, Dr. Manhattan could
literally teleport the entire Thunderbolts team

522
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:35,100
to Mars and they would all just die. Well, the
century wouldn't and he would bring him right back

523
00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:41,560
to Earth and then kick Dr. Manhattan right in his
blue wiener. Whatever. Also, we don't consider

524
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:49,520
battlefield removal as a viable strategy in these
duels. Says you. Yeah, says the winner. Are you

525
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:55,580
sad, Jonathan? I'm not going to lie. I am pretty
sad. Like, I just want to go to bed now. Do you think

526
00:52:55,580 --> 00:53:01,680
we could get you crying on air before we sign off?
Well, let me try. Let me try. No, I can't do it.

527
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:09,320
Sorry. Well, that's too bad. But that doesn't for
this duel, guys. Agent 9K, help close this out.

535
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:57,320
to see it. Basically staying off the Internet for
the whole rest of the week because I'm not seeing it

536

spoilers. And I could just forward them to you
because I'm petty for losing this match. But thank

538
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:15,560

545
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:47,600
shit. I lost it.
