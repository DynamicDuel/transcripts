1
00:00:03,277 --> 00:00:03,338
you

2
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,593
Dynamic Dual Podcast, a weekly show where we
review superhero films and debate the superiority

3
00:00:28,633 --> 00:00:34,657
between Marvel and DC by comparing their characters
in stat-based battle simulations. I'm Marvelous

4
00:00:34,717 --> 00:00:40,181
Joe. And I'm his twin brother Johnny DC. And
in this episode, it's a Halloween themed episode,

5
00:00:40,221 --> 00:00:45,344
we're going to find out who would win in a fight
between the Batman villain, Man-Bat, and the

6
00:00:45,424 --> 00:00:52,209
Spider-Man villain, Morbius. Yeah, Morbius is
like a vampire and Man-Bat is like this man

7
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:52,969
that's a bat.

8
00:00:57,487 --> 00:01:03,270
It's spooky. Yeah. Morbius isn't strictly a
vampire. He's like a pseudo vampire. Basically

9
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:08,632
he did some experiments with vampire bats and
became not a supernatural type of vampire but

10
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:13,014
like a scientific type of vampire. That was
all done due to the Comics Code Authority because

11
00:01:13,034 --> 00:01:17,276
they couldn't include actual vampires in the
comics at the time. Yeah, so glad that the

12
00:01:17,316 --> 00:01:21,542
publishers got away from using that. Before
we gather statistics on these characters. and

13
00:01:21,602 --> 00:01:25,483
run them through 1,000 simulations to find out
who would win in a fight, we're going to go

14
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:29,344
over the comic book movie news from the past
week. There wasn't too much news to come out

15
00:01:29,364 --> 00:01:34,465
this past week, basically because DC is gonna
save all their headlines for the upcoming DC

16
00:01:34,485 --> 00:01:39,666
fandom event that's coming out on October 16th.
And basically Marvel is holding on to their

17
00:01:39,707 --> 00:01:44,008
news so that they can release it right after
the event so that they can poach all the headlines.

18
00:01:44,028 --> 00:01:49,509
What? But we will be discussing the upcoming
full celebrity guest list that will be at the

19
00:01:49,529 --> 00:01:54,078
DC fandom event. Marvel totally would pull a
dick move like that. I can't wait for them

20
00:01:54,098 --> 00:01:58,840
to pull that dick move just so I could call
them out on pulling that dick move. And then

21
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:05,161
what are you gonna do about it? Call them dicks.

32
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:06,076
is an award that Marvel used to give out up
until the 90s to fans. Our version, the Dynamic

33
00:03:06,116 --> 00:03:11,059
Duel No Prize, is a digital award that we post
on social media that I personally draw for

34
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:15,963
those who we feel gave the best answer to our
question of the week. For last week, we asked,

35
00:03:16,323 --> 00:03:21,206
who is your favorite Marvel or DC character
created or partially created? by Jack Kirby

36
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:26,428
and why. Of course, Jack Kirby was one of the
most prolific comic book creators back in the

37
00:03:26,468 --> 00:03:31,410
golden age and silver age of comics. He created
a ton of Marvel and DC's beloved characters

38
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,272
and a lot of you guys responded with your favorites.
Let's go ahead and run down our honorable mentions

39
00:03:35,312 --> 00:03:41,454
as well as the no prize winner. Our first honorable
mention goes to Nate who said, Hey guys, it's

40
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:46,877
Nate here and for the question of the week,
could you ask a more vague question? I mean,

41
00:03:46,917 --> 00:03:52,283
honestly, you could say any. one of your favorite
characters and chances are, Jack the King Kirby

42
00:03:52,303 --> 00:03:58,067
has made it. But in all honesty, I gotta go
with my favorite character by him is Galactus.

43
00:03:58,587 --> 00:04:06,732
To this day, his design holds up and it is fantastic.
No pun intended, I guess. Well, to answer your

44
00:04:06,752 --> 00:04:12,836
question about whether we could ask something
more vague, the answer is yes. Yes, yeah, totally,

45
00:04:12,936 --> 00:04:16,962
we could have. But to respond to the second
part of your answer. Yeah, when it comes to

46
00:04:17,242 --> 00:04:24,185
Jack Kirby's character designs, I think Lactis
is the epitome of his complex style of line

47
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:29,547
work and tech-like embellishments, similar to
how he designed the Celestials or the New Gods

48
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:34,990
over on DC. And it's so strange because it's
like the complete opposite of the Silver Surfer

49
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:40,672
character who's very stripped down, basically
just like this naked silver dude without any

50
00:04:40,712 --> 00:04:45,686
embellishments. Right, very streamlined. Yeah.
The silhouette of Galactus, I think, is one

51
00:04:45,706 --> 00:04:52,029
of the most iconic and striking designs in comics.
There's like nothing else like it. Oh, definitely

52
00:04:52,089 --> 00:04:57,051
not, yeah, and I really can't wait till we see
him in live action. Like, properly? Right,

53
00:04:57,131 --> 00:05:00,173
yeah, yeah. Because I've seen him show up in
like some video games and stuff and he just

54
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:05,235
looks so epic. And it's gonna be awesome when
he eventually rears his head in the MCU. Our

55
00:05:05,275 --> 00:05:10,357
next honorable mention goes to Michael Haggerty,
who said... Hey guys, Michael Haggerty here.

56
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:16,051
So uh... My favorite character by Jack Kirby,
there's only one real way to bring him out,

57
00:05:16,131 --> 00:05:22,154
to announce him like a wrestler. And it's this,
gone the form of man. My favorite Jack Kirby

58
00:05:22,174 --> 00:05:29,437
character is Etrigan. Oh, hit you with a poem.
Anyway, yeah that's it. I'm kind of embarrassed

59
00:05:29,497 --> 00:05:33,538
I did that, but you know, whatever. It's cool,
I stand by it. I stand by my decision. Etrigan.

60
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:39,421
Etrigan for president. Yeah? We prefer all of
our answers to be in the form of a poem. Yeah,

61
00:05:39,481 --> 00:05:44,756
totally. Take note guys. You know, Etrogen is
definitely one of the coolest characters, I

62
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:49,641
think personally, that Jack Kirby came up with.
Definitely one of the darkest. Oh yeah, I mean

63
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:55,727
the spectrum within which Jack Kirby operated
was so broad in terms of genre and different

64
00:05:55,787 --> 00:06:00,071
types of characters. It was awesome. The man
could work within any subject matter. Whether

65
00:06:00,091 --> 00:06:05,818
it was like, you know, the super patriotic Captain
America. to like the dark demonic magic realm

66
00:06:05,878 --> 00:06:11,500
that Etrigan operated in to like the cosmic
sci-fi arena of like the new gods or silver

67
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,561
surfer or something like that. There was like
nothing he couldn't do. I like the medieval

68
00:06:15,601 --> 00:06:19,562
like tunic he gave him. You know, it's not often
that you think of demons and think of them

69
00:06:19,602 --> 00:06:23,343
wearing like lighthearted medieval outfits,
but he made it work and still made them so

70
00:06:23,363 --> 00:06:27,964
bad ass. It was very unique. You wanna talk
about how unique he was in the form of a poem?

71
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:46,272
words and poems for me to share. This is a challenge
I do not like, but if you don't like it, then

72
00:06:46,432 --> 00:06:47,293
take a hike.

73
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:59,278
Ah, Jonathan, the next freestyle artist out
there. I am the worst. All right, let's go

74
00:06:59,298 --> 00:07:04,441
ahead and move on to our next honorable mention
given by DC Joe, who said. I got two answers

75
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:10,424
to this question. First answer is Darkseid,
because he's just one of the most interesting

76
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:16,927
and most powerful villain that there ever was.
And the other answer is Dr. Doom. In his own

77
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:22,970
right, he's interesting, but without Dr. Doom,
there is no MF Doom. best rapper ever, R.I.P.

78
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:31,232
I mean, I think Jonathan might be the best new
rapper out there now. Sweet. But yeah, great

79
00:07:31,292 --> 00:07:37,054
answer with Darkseid and Dr. Doom, respectively,
probably DC and Marvel's greatest villains

80
00:07:37,134 --> 00:07:41,875
ever. It's so crazy that one guy came up with
like the baddest villains for both respective

81
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:46,296
universes, right? Yeah, they're both very different,
but also, you know, they have some similarities.

82
00:07:46,677 --> 00:07:51,534
They both like to stand around with their arms
behind their back a lot. They both also wear

83
00:07:51,634 --> 00:07:56,898
like tunics. Does Darkseid wear a tunic? Yeah,
kinda, sorta. At least in his original design.

84
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:01,922
I do have to say Darkseid would totally stomp
on Doctor Doom. I mean, we all saw what Doctor

85
00:08:01,942 --> 00:08:07,346
Doom did to Thanos in 2015's Secret Wars event,
so I don't know about that. I mean, Thanos

86
00:08:07,366 --> 00:08:12,209
is no Darkseid. Let's be real. I mean, that's
true, because Thanos is better. Do we need

87
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:17,813
to go back to the duel episode between Thanos
and Darkseid? Nope. Exactly. Great answer,

88
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:22,608
DC Joe. That does it for our honorable mentions.
We want to give big shout outs to Miggy Mathagean,

89
00:08:22,888 --> 00:08:26,771
Patrick and Evan Tomkeaf for taking the time
to visit our website and leave their answers

90
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:34,016
as well. But the winner of this week's No Prize
is CJ Kraft who said, CJ Kraft here and my

91
00:08:34,076 --> 00:08:39,440
favorite Jack Kirby creation has to be the ever
loving blue eyed thing from Yancy Street. Whenever

92
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,823
it's clobbering time, he gets the job done.
His battles with the Hulk are epic. His back

93
00:08:44,863 --> 00:08:49,822
and forth with Johnny Storm is some of the funniest
stuff in comics. They just apparently can't

94
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:55,025
get them right in movies. Come on, Marvel, you
gotta fix that. But no other character has

95
00:08:55,085 --> 00:09:01,069
so much of Jack in him, right down to the cigar-chomping
and smart mouth. So gotta be the Thing. Oh

96
00:09:01,109 --> 00:09:05,411
yeah, definitely. The Thing is such a great
answer when it comes to Jack Kirby's creations.

97
00:09:05,812 --> 00:09:10,494
You're right, there was so much that Jack Kirby
had in common with the character of The Thing.

98
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:16,426
It was almost like he personified himself in
comic form. And what a lovable character. so

99
00:09:16,486 --> 00:09:21,449
influential, you know, the Fantastic Four really
put Marvel comics on the map in the Silver

100
00:09:21,549 --> 00:09:25,592
Age and the character like the thing had never
really been done before, you know, basically

101
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:30,115
you had this monster who was a hero, usually
monsters were saved for, you know, villains

102
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:34,338
or monster tales and the like. And really all
of Jack Kirby's work was really influential,

103
00:09:34,398 --> 00:09:39,782
he created so many popular characters that you
know have stood the test of time. It's remarkable

104
00:09:39,802 --> 00:09:45,810
that one man could have that amount of influence.
I think he's had more influence. over the comics

105
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:49,933
medium and the characters within than any other
person. At least when it comes to Marvel and

106
00:09:49,973 --> 00:09:55,376
DC for sure. Oh absolutely, yeah. The King.
King Kirby. Yeah and it's always nice to revisit

107
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:59,198
some of these early creators that really formed
the Marvel and DC universe we know and love

108
00:09:59,618 --> 00:10:05,101
as a fan base we owe so much to them. But congrats
again to CJ Craft. Guys, CJ is a long-time

109
00:10:05,142 --> 00:10:10,945
listener of this show. Every year he puts out
a new collection of short horror stories called

110
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:16,517
Pages of Terror. And a day after this episode
drops, October 13th, his third book, Pages

111
00:10:16,557 --> 00:10:22,042
of Terror 3, hits Amazon. And he's also compiled
these first three books into a collection called

112
00:10:22,142 --> 00:10:27,986
Pages of Terror Trilogy of Fear. I myself read
both of his first books. He's a magnificent

113
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:32,150
horror writer. So if you're into that at all

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:38,235
onto Amazon and check out Pages of Terror Trilogy
of Fear or any of his Pages of Terror books.

115
00:10:38,275 --> 00:10:43,226
Yeah, I really gotta say, over these past years,
CJ has been like super inspirational and how

116
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:47,609
he's really pursuing you know his dream of becoming
a writer. I think he's mentioned before like

117
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:53,432
writers write and that's exactly what he's doing.
As someone who aspires to be you know an artist,

118
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:58,515
a writer, myself, I'm really proud of the work
that CJ has done and the fact that he's putting

119
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:03,577
them out there for all of us to read is really
admirable. So congrats once again to CJ for

120
00:11:03,617 --> 00:11:08,540
releasing another book and guys definitely support
your indie artists. That does it for the No

121
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,135
Prize. If you the listener want a shot at winning
your Stay tuned to later on this episode when

122
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:18,013
we'll be asking another question of the week.
And now that that's done, on to the news!

123
00:11:23,822 --> 00:11:32,124
Okay, so DC's second annual virtual comic convention,
the DC Fandom, is this upcoming Saturday, October

00:11:32,164 --> 00:11:38,266
16th. And last week, they announced the full
celebrity guest list that will appear during

125
00:11:38,306 --> 00:11:43,948
the virtual panels. It's a huge list! Yeah,
there's gonna be a lot of people there when

126
00:11:43,988 --> 00:11:49,189
they release the trailer for the DC Fandom event.
While I did recognize some of the celebrities

127
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:53,062
that are gonna be part of this thing... there
were a lot of faces I didn't recognize. They

128
00:11:53,082 --> 00:11:57,964
were like, join me. And I'm like, I don't even
know who you are. So we have the full celebrity

129
00:11:58,024 --> 00:12:03,205

Adam movie. What about Angel Manuel Soto? He's

139
00:12:51,546 --> 00:12:56,007
the director of HBO Max's upcoming Blue Beetle
film. Oh, so we might get news about that,

140
00:12:56,067 --> 00:13:02,069
that's cool. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anne LeMay, who's
that? She works for WB Games. She's probably

141
00:13:02,089 --> 00:13:06,210
gonna be tied to some video game. I'm not sure
which one, and I'm not sure why they're calling

142
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,991
her a celebrity. Next on the list is Anson Mount.
I already know who that is. He was the guy

143
00:13:11,011 --> 00:13:15,553
who played Black Bolt in the Inhumans television
show, and he's voicing Batman in the Injustice

144
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:21,932
animated movie. That's right. Ava DuVernay?
Ava DuVernay, she was going to do a New Gods

145
00:13:21,972 --> 00:13:26,176
film but that got scrapped. She's gonna be here
because she's probably gonna be promoting the

146
00:13:26,256 --> 00:13:32,721
upcoming CW series, Naomi. Who's Bilal Fallah?
He's the other co-director of the Batgirl film

147
00:13:32,761 --> 00:13:38,106
for HBO Max. Bruce Timm, we all know him. Yeah,
yeah, he's a major producer of a lot of DC's

148
00:13:38,186 --> 00:13:43,831
animated content. Cam Newton is gonna be there?
Is that the same Cam Newton as the quarterback

149
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:49,455
Cam Newton? Yes, it is. And honestly- I can't
figure out why he's gonna be there. I think

150
00:13:49,475 --> 00:13:53,837
he just really likes DC Comics. What a loser.
I'm glad the Broncos beat him in that Super

151
00:13:53,877 --> 00:14:01,942
Bowl about a decade ago. Alright, who's Cameras
Johnson? He's an actor on the Batwoman CW TV

152
00:14:01,982 --> 00:14:07,185
series. He plays Luke Fox, Lucius Fox's son.
And he's supposed to be suiting up as Batwing

153
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:12,568
in this next season. Oh, that's cool. That's
cool. Candice Patton? She plays Iris West on

154
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:19,238
CW's Flash TV series. Okay, who's Chris Wood?
He plays Manel on the Supergirl series. Lotta

155
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:23,900
CW actors here. Oh, is that Manel part of the
Legion of Superheroes? Yes, yes he is. There's

156
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,261
actually a few Legion members that appear on
the Supergirl series. Interesting. Next up

157
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:33,082
is Christian Convery. Oh, I'm excited for this
actually. He's the young actor who plays Sweet

158
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:37,504
Tooth on the Netflix show of the same name.
So hopefully we get some kind of news about

159
00:14:37,784 --> 00:14:42,265
season two of that show, because that show was
freaking awesome. And who's Christina Hudson?

160
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:47,079
She was the screenwriter on Birds of Prey. but
she's also writing the upcoming Flash movie

161
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:53,641
as well as Batgirl for HBO Max. David Harewood?
He plays Hank Henshaw. Really, he plays Martian

162
00:14:53,661 --> 00:14:59,264
Manator who's pretending to be Hank Henshaw
in the Supergirl series. And who's Dennis Cowan?

163
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:04,006
He's a comic book artist. He's done quite a
bit of work for the milestone characters like

164
00:15:04,126 --> 00:15:09,288
Icon and Static Shock. And who's Donald Mustard?
I've never heard that name before. He is the

165
00:15:09,348 --> 00:15:15,852
chief creative officer for Epic Games. So...
Maybe there might be some big DC Fortnite announcement

166
00:15:16,112 --> 00:15:20,655
during the fandom. That would be really cool.
That would be cool. Who the hell is this Dwayne

167
00:15:20,715 --> 00:15:26,219
Johnson guy? Actually, that's the one name on
the list that I had no idea what he was doing.

168
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:31,603
Something about like the hierarchy of power
in the DC universe. He's changing it forever

169
00:15:31,623 --> 00:15:37,247
or something. I don't know. Sounds lame. Who
is Echo Kellum? Oh, he was the actor who played

170
00:15:37,287 --> 00:15:42,342
Mr. Terrific in the CW Arrow series, which is
over. I don't know, maybe he'll make an appearance

171
00:15:42,362 --> 00:15:47,607
on Flash. I haven't really been keeping up with
the CW shows. So. Looks like Ed Boon is gonna

172
00:15:47,627 --> 00:15:51,930
be there. Of course, he's the head of NetherRealm
Games. Yeah, it's expected that he's going

173
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:57,154
to announce Injustice 3, though I'm really hoping
that he announces the video game that he's

174
00:15:57,174 --> 00:16:02,379
been talking about making on Twitter, which
is DC vs. Marvel. That will break the internet

175
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:08,824
and my mind. Elizabeth Gillies, who that is?
She's gonna voice the character of Catwoman

176
00:16:09,224 --> 00:16:15,607
in the upcoming animated film Catwoman hunted.
Okay, cool. What about Elizabeth Tullock? She's

177
00:16:15,647 --> 00:16:21,668
the actress who plays Lois Lane in Superman
and Lois Ezra Miller. Hmm. What's he all about?

178
00:16:21,908 --> 00:16:28,070
He of course is the actor who plays the Flash
in the DCEU Who's Freddy Stroma? He's gonna

179
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:33,992
be playing vigilante in the upcoming Peacemaker
series and Gareth Dunnett Aloe said he's the

180
00:16:34,012 --> 00:16:40,293
writer of the upcoming Blue Beetle film Grant
Gustin He's the Flash on the CW flash series

181
00:16:40,822 --> 00:16:46,503
What about Hindon Walsh? She's a voice actress,
probably most notably in DC for the voice of

182
00:16:46,563 --> 00:16:52,325
Starfire in the Teen Titans Go series. And Jacob
Bertrand? Most people probably know him as

183
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:57,307
the Hawk in the Cobra Kai series, but he's gonna
do one of the voices in the Batwell series

184
00:16:57,347 --> 00:17:01,828
for Cartoon Network as well. James Gunn is gonna
be there? Oh, probably promoting Peacemaker,

185
00:17:01,848 --> 00:17:08,091
right? Yeah. Who's Jason Momoa? He's gonna kick
your ass. He of course is Aquaman, I really

186
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:12,934
hope we get like some kind of teaser footage
for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. Javisha Leslie?

187
00:17:13,474 --> 00:17:18,197
She's the actress who plays Batwoman in the
Batwoman series. Okay moving on to Jennifer

188
00:17:18,217 --> 00:17:23,261
Holland? That's actually James Gunn's girlfriend.
She's going to be one of Peacemaker's handlers

189
00:17:23,581 --> 00:17:27,384
in the Peacemaker TV series. Oh that's right
and she was also in the Suicide Squad movie.

190
00:17:27,704 --> 00:17:33,268
That's right. Okay who's Jesse Rath? He's the
actor who plays Brainiac 5 in Supergirl. Another

191
00:17:33,308 --> 00:17:39,507
Legionnaire. Who the hell is this Jim Lee guy?
Jim Lee of course is the publisher and CCO

192
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:44,389
of DC Comics. Also one of the best comic book
artists of our time. Yeah, for sure. He's been

193
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:48,491
like teasing this massive artwork piece that
he's been working on for like the past few

194
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:53,013
months on his Instagram. I can't wait to see
that thing fully unveiled. It's gonna be incredible.

195
00:17:53,513 --> 00:17:57,215
Oh, JJ Abrams is gonna be there. That's cool.
So he's probably gonna be talking about like

196
00:17:57,255 --> 00:18:02,317
Justice League Dark. Yeah, probably like the
upcoming Zatanna movie. And I think also Constantine.

197
00:18:03,137 --> 00:18:08,132
And Superman, right? Possibly. Yeah, the upcoming
Superman project that's being written by Ta-Nehisi

198
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:13,094
Coates. John Cena is gonna be there, of course
promoting peacemaker Justin Hartley, I know

199
00:18:13,114 --> 00:18:17,357
that name. Isn't he the guy voicing Superman
on the upcoming injustice movie? Yeah, that's

200
00:18:17,397 --> 00:18:23,000
right. Casey Walfall She's the actress that's
playing Naomi in the upcoming CW show. Kaylee

201
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:27,382
Cuoco is gonna be there Of course, she voices
Harley Quinn in that animated series and what

202
00:18:27,402 --> 00:18:33,405

that movie Linda Carter. She of course played

203
00:18:33,465 --> 00:18:38,471
Wonder Woman in the old school TV series, but
she most recently played Asterea in the Wonder

204
00:18:38,491 --> 00:18:44,532
Woman 1984 movie. Matt Bomer? Of course he's
playing Negative Man in the Doom Patrol series,

205
00:18:44,552 --> 00:18:49,374
he also voiced the Flash in the recent Justice
Society World War II movie. That's right. Matt

206
00:18:49,434 --> 00:18:54,055
Reeves, he's the director of the upcoming Batman
movie. We're supposed to get a trailer for

207
00:18:54,075 --> 00:18:58,116
the Batman, hopefully we get that, that'll be
cool. I think that's the thing I'm most looking

208
00:18:58,156 --> 00:19:05,214
forward to. Melissa Benoist? Is that how you
pronounce it? Benoist? Yeah, it is. She's Supergirl,

209
00:19:05,254 --> 00:19:11,456
of course, in the CW series. Noah Centineo.
He's gonna be playing Adam Smasher in the upcoming

210
00:19:11,536 --> 00:19:16,857
Black Adam movie. Patrick Redding. He's the
creative director for Warner Bros. Games, so

211
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:21,318
I think he'll be talking about Gotham Knights.
Patty Jenkins is gonna be there, interesting.

212
00:19:21,758 --> 00:19:26,400
Yeah, yeah, it is interesting. She, of course,
directed Wonder Woman and Wonder Woman 1984.

213
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,881
I'm wondering if she's there to announce Wonder
Woman 3. Maybe, maybe not. Pierce Brosnan.

214
00:19:33,314 --> 00:19:38,755
Holy shit. Man needs no introduction. Of course
he's gonna be playing Dr. Fate in the upcoming

215
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:44,597
Black Adam movie. That's huge. I'll be tuning
into that panel for sure. Quintessa Swindell.

216
00:19:44,757 --> 00:19:48,698
The name sounds familiar. Who's that? They're
the actor that's gonna be playing Cyclone in

217
00:19:48,758 --> 00:19:53,739
Black Adam. Reggie Hudlin. I already know who
that guy is. He's a writer and producer and

218
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:58,080
director. He's done work for Marvel Comics as
well, but he also works for DC. Oh yeah, he's

219
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:03,766
one of the minds behind DC's milestone media
relaunch. What about Robert- Pattinson who's

220
00:20:03,806 --> 00:20:11,508
that guy? He's the goddamn Batman! What about
Ron Funches? He does the voice of King Shark

221
00:20:11,788 --> 00:20:17,409
on the Harley Quinn animated series. And Scott
Minville? He does the voice of Robin in Teen

222
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:22,591
Titans Go. Scott Snyder. Is that Zack Snyder's
brother? Everyone asks that I'm sure he gets

223
00:20:22,611 --> 00:20:28,232
that question all the time. He's a popular writer
for DC Comics. What about Sefton Hill who's

224
00:20:28,252 --> 00:20:33,598
that guy? He's the creative director and co-founder
of Rocksteady Games. He'll be Suicide Squad

225
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:38,440
killed the Justice League, most likely. Steve
Aggey? He's gonna be in the upcoming Peacemaker

226
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,323
series. He was also in the Suicide Squad and
did the mocap work for King Shark. Tara Strong?

227
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:49,485
She is the voice of Raven in Teen Titans Go.
And also has done a lot of Harley Quinn work

228
00:20:49,525 --> 00:20:54,047
as well. Yeah, yep. All right, next is Todd
McFarlane. That's pretty cool. Yeah, he's gonna

229
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:59,269
be there probably to talk about the DC toy line
that he's making. They're really cool toy sculpts.

230
00:20:59,694 --> 00:21:03,797
Tyler Hocklin is going to be there. Of course,
he's the actor that plays Superman in the Superman

231
00:21:03,817 --> 00:21:08,601
and Lois television show. That's right. Shiloh
Mardi Dwenya. He's the actor who's going to

232
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:12,885
be playing Blue Beetle in the upcoming movie.
He's also known for his work on Cobra Kai.

233
00:21:13,425 --> 00:21:17,409
Oh, look at that. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is also
going to be there. Yeah, he's the actor who

234
00:21:17,449 --> 00:21:22,713
played Black Manta in the first Aquaman movie.
I imagine he's going to be there for the sequel,

235
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:28,486
but he was also Dr. Manhattan in the Watchmen
television series for HBO Max. so you never

236
00:21:28,506 --> 00:21:33,008
know what else he may be there for. Zachary
Levi is gonna be there. Of course, yep, he's

237
00:21:33,048 --> 00:21:38,050
the actor who plays Shazam in those movies.
And last but not least, Zoe Kravitz, who of

238
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:43,852
course is playing Catwoman in the upcoming The
Batman movie. Right. So a few awesome names

239
00:21:43,892 --> 00:21:48,334
there. I'm probably only gonna turn into the
fandom for a few panels here and there, but

240
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:52,716
largely, like most Marvel fans, I'll be skipping
the fandom. Good, we don't even want you there,

241
00:21:52,816 --> 00:22:01,008
Normie. Ha ha ha. This is for DC fans. This
list is missing notably I think like Jeff Johns

242
00:22:01,188 --> 00:22:06,012
or anyone else involved in the Green Lantern
Corps series for HBO Max. I'm actually really

243
00:22:06,052 --> 00:22:09,694
surprised not to see anyone's name because that's
like one of the big projects that I'm really

244
00:22:09,714 --> 00:22:14,057
looking forward to hearing more about. Yeah,
where's like Michael Keaton? Yeah, yeah, there's

245
00:22:14,097 --> 00:22:18,180
no Michael Keaton and there's no Sasha Kaia
either, which is kind of disappointing. And

246
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,804
no Andy Muschietti who's directing The Flash.
What's up with that? I was wondering the same

247
00:22:22,844 --> 00:22:27,186
thing. Apparently the only one that's going
to be repping The Flash is gonna be Ezra Miller

248
00:22:27,267 --> 00:22:31,969
during the fandom. Which is kinda disappointing.
Overall, does this list make you more or less

249
00:22:32,009 --> 00:22:36,972
excited for the fandom? I mean, I'm really excited.
This list, I wouldn't say it made me more excited.

250
00:22:37,192 --> 00:22:41,415
It's kind of pretty much what I was expecting.
But yeah, if we would've seen some Henry Cavill

251
00:22:41,475 --> 00:22:45,497
on there or some Michael Keaton, I would've
been much more excited. Well, cool, we'll see

252
00:22:45,517 --> 00:22:50,200
how it all goes down this Saturday, October
16th. How do you visit the DC Fandom event?

253
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:55,804

254
00:22:55,985 --> 00:23:00,030

time to check it out. All in all, though, there's

255
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:03,934
going to be a ton of DC projects that they're
going to be talking about. I'm personally most

256
00:23:03,954 --> 00:23:08,780
looking forward to any project that involves
the DCEU. And that brings us to our question

257
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,181
of the week.

275
00:24:52,846 --> 00:24:57,213
Thanks again to HBO Max for sponsoring this
episode. But now let's get into the main event

276
00:24:57,394 --> 00:25:03,464
where we pit the Batman villain, Man-Bat, against
the Spider-Man villain, Morbius, the living

277
00:25:03,504 --> 00:25:04,025
vampire.

278
00:25:19,022 --> 00:25:26,605
Alright, Manbat vs Morbius. As we said earlier,
Manbat is basically Manbear Pig, but minus

279
00:25:26,645 --> 00:25:31,787
the bear pig and adding a bat. So he's kind
of lame, but Morbius on the other hand is a

280
00:25:31,847 --> 00:25:38,230
legit vampire. Just in time for Halloween, right
off the back of our Venom Let There Be Carnage

281
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:43,592
review. Morbius is of course a Spider-Man villain
who is also getting his own live action film

282
00:25:43,632 --> 00:25:48,462
this upcoming January starring Jared Lotto as
the character. And that film was supposed to

283
00:25:48,502 --> 00:25:52,465
come out already. We've been planning this episode
for a while, and we always kind of figured

284
00:25:52,485 --> 00:25:57,769
that we would be pitting Man-Bat against Morbius
considering both characters were scientists

285
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:04,094
who became supervillains by experimenting with
bats. Yeah, I don't know too much about Man-Bat.

286
00:26:04,414 --> 00:26:09,158
Is Man-Bat like vampiric at all, or is he just
like a giant fucking bat? He's like a giant

287
00:26:09,198 --> 00:26:15,850
motherfucking bat. What? Well, that is something
to look out for. If you've never listened to

288
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:19,934
one of our duel episodes before, the way we'll
determine a winner between Manbat and Morbius

289
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:25,299
is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations using
their statistics. Now, a Monte Carlo simulation

290
00:26:25,439 --> 00:26:30,864
is a probabilistic model used to determine outcomes
through random sampling. In our case, it randomizes

291
00:26:30,904 --> 00:26:35,428
statistics along a normal distribution, which
is a bell curve, as a way to simulate the many

292
00:26:35,448 --> 00:26:40,212
variables that can occur during battle. The
stat parameters we use are based on the official

293
00:26:40,252 --> 00:26:45,829
Marvel power grid. and we use that criteria
to extrapolate the DC's character stats. We've

294
00:26:45,849 --> 00:26:50,173
included some additional stat categories of
our own, such as range, damage, potential,

295
00:26:50,213 --> 00:26:56,177
versatility, and perception, in order to create
a more complete and robust simulation. Running

296
00:26:56,217 --> 00:27:00,401
these 1000 simulations gives us a percentage
of wins for each character, and we declare

297
00:27:00,421 --> 00:27:04,304
the one with the higher percentage to be the
ultimate victor, considering that they're more

298
00:27:04,344 --> 00:27:09,600
likely to win any given battle. No character
ever wins 100% of the time. Comics have shown

299
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:14,104
that there's always a way for Batman to defeat
Superman. We feel our method falls in line

300
00:27:14,124 --> 00:27:17,947
with the precedents that have been established
in the comic book stories. And we used this

301
00:27:18,007 --> 00:27:22,491
method because it was the least subjective,
most unbiased way to determine who would win.

302
00:27:22,791 --> 00:27:26,655
Of course, we were both heavily biased toward
our respective allegiances, and instead of

303
00:27:26,695 --> 00:27:31,939
debating these matches forever, we just let
the math decide for us. So there's no fan votes

304
00:27:31,979 --> 00:27:36,983
here, and no relying on just feats. Before we
run the simulations though, we like to break

305
00:27:37,003 --> 00:27:41,828
down each character's histories and abilities
before improvising a scenario on how we imagine

306
00:27:42,048 --> 00:27:47,132
one of the 1000 simulations we run would play
out beat for beat. And I think it's my turn

307
00:27:47,152 --> 00:27:50,215
to break down the Marvel character's history
first, so let me go ahead and tell you guys

308
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:56,380
all about Morbius, the living vampire. Michael
Morbius was born in Greece to a single mother

309
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,125
and grew up with a rare blood disorder similar
to hemophilia. Fearful of her son getting injured,

310
00:28:02,582 --> 00:28:07,346
Michael's mom kept him indoors for most of his
childhood, often bringing him books to read

311
00:28:07,406 --> 00:28:12,451
from the bookstore where she worked. Michael
became an intellectually gifted child, though

312
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:17,556
he occasionally sneaked out of the house to
play with his best friend, Emil Nicos. During

313
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:23,422
one such outing, he fell and got injured, causing
both boys to get into trouble and vow to one

314
00:28:23,462 --> 00:28:28,979
day cure Michael's condition. Michael and Emil
grew up... and studied science together at

315
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:34,403
their university, specializing in human and
animal biology. They won a Nobel Prize for

316
00:28:34,423 --> 00:28:39,928
their research on using vampire bat blood to
cure several other blood disorders, convincing

317
00:28:39,988 --> 00:28:45,612
Michael that was the key to fixing his own condition.
Michael became engaged to a fellow scientist

318
00:28:45,712 --> 00:28:51,477
named Martin Bancroft, though his body was quickly
weakening. Debilitated to the point where he

319
00:28:51,517 --> 00:28:56,541
could barely lift a coffee mug, Michael rushed
an experiment on himself using the vampire

320
00:28:56,561 --> 00:29:02,994
bat blood. and electroshock therapy. The process
transformed his body. His skin turned chalk

321
00:29:03,014 --> 00:29:08,878
white, his canine teeth protruded fangs, his
nose flattened like a bat's, and his eyes turned

322
00:29:08,938 --> 00:29:14,803
blood red. Michael's blood disorder had mutated
into a disease of pseudo vampirism, and he

323
00:29:14,843 --> 00:29:19,827
immediately developed an intense thirst for
human blood. He lashed out and bit his lab

324
00:29:19,847 --> 00:29:25,527
partner and friend, Emil, killing him and drinking
his blood. which revitalized Michael to a normal

325
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:30,550
appearance and healthy physicality that he had
never known. Restored to his normal mental

326
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:35,314
state, Michael was shocked to see that he had
murdered his childhood friend. Saddened and

327
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:40,597
horrified by what he had become, and to protect
his fiancee, Martine, he threw himself into

328
00:29:40,617 --> 00:29:45,440
the Mediterranean Sea, though a fishing vessel
that was traveling toward New York City soon

329
00:29:45,481 --> 00:29:50,964
picked him up. By the time the boat reached
the US, all the crewmen were dead, as Michael

330
00:29:51,004 --> 00:29:56,083
feasted on them during the voyage. He washed
up on the South Hampton shore where Spider-Man

331
00:29:56,143 --> 00:30:01,165
and the Lizard were at the time. Thirsty, Michael
attacked the pair, but was overpowered and

332
00:30:01,205 --> 00:30:05,927
had to flee back into the night. The Lizard
was able to use a sample of Michael's blood

333
00:30:06,027 --> 00:30:12,010
to create a serum that could temporarily transform
himself back into his human form and cure Spider-Man,

334
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:17,053
who had at that point mutated into having six
arms. You can learn more about Spider-Man in

335
00:30:17,093 --> 00:30:21,666
our Blue Beetle vs Spider-Man dual episode.
Michael began reluctantly feeding off of New

336
00:30:21,707 --> 00:30:27,869
Yorkers, occasionally turning random victims
into pseudo-vampires themselves. He tried abstaining

337
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:33,052
from drinking blood, but the thirst would take
over when given enough time. Distraught, he

338
00:30:33,092 --> 00:30:37,854
tried to commit suicide, though his new healing
factor would not let him die. With nowhere

339
00:30:37,874 --> 00:30:43,337
to turn, Michael reached out to his former fiancée,
Martine, who collaborated with him from overseas

340
00:30:43,637 --> 00:30:48,683
in developing an antidote. They created a serum
derived from his blood that would cure his

341
00:30:48,743 --> 00:30:54,165
turned victims of their vampirism, though it
unfortunately did not work on himself. He declared

342
00:30:54,205 --> 00:30:58,627
that if he must drink blood in his search for
a cure, then it should be the blood of criminals.

343
00:30:59,267 --> 00:31:03,709
In an attempt to become an anti-hero, Michael
discovered a woman named Barbara Clark, who

344
00:31:03,729 --> 00:31:08,631
was being pursued by a demon named Nilrack.
He went through great lengths to protect the

345
00:31:08,651 --> 00:31:13,333
woman from the monster, though afterward, he
killed Barbara and drank her blood to satisfy

346
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:19,301
his thirst. feeling immense guilt at his lack
of control. Eventually, Blade the Vampire Hunter,

347
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:23,443
whom you can learn more about in our Asriel
vs Blade episode, came across Michael and tried

348
00:31:23,463 --> 00:31:28,406
to kill him. Once Blade learned about Morbius'
plight, however, and his anti-hero status,

349
00:31:28,806 --> 00:31:34,029
the two teamed up to defeat an otherworldly
sorcerer named Daimond. Michael also met and

350
00:31:34,069 --> 00:31:39,192
tried to stop another sympathetic monster known
as the Werewolf by Night, real name Jack Russell,

351
00:31:39,572 --> 00:31:44,703
and the two became reluctant rivals. Eventually,
they both teamed up with Ghost Rider and Man-Thing

352
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:49,885
and formed the first incarnation of the Legion
of Monsters superhero team, though they soon

353
00:31:49,925 --> 00:31:55,047
disbanded after accidentally killing a benevolent
entity called the Starseed. Believing that

354
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:59,989
perhaps Spider-Man's radioactive blood held
the key to his antidote, Michael attacked him

355
00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:05,491
and managed to get his fangs in the hero's neck.
At that moment, he was hit by a bolt of lightning,

356
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:12,558
which somehow resulted in Michael being cured
of his pseudo-vampirism. Authorities charged

357
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:17,879
him for his crimes as a vampire, though She-Hulk
defended him in court claiming he was not responsible

358
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:23,741
for his actions. After living life as a normal
human again for a few years, Michael was captured

359
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:29,163
and reverted back to his pseudo-vampire condition
by the Voodoo Queen. He teamed up with Dr.

360
00:32:29,203 --> 00:32:33,404
Strange and Brother Voodoo to stop the Voodoo
Queen's attempt to bring back vampires after

361
00:32:33,444 --> 00:32:38,190
Dr. Strange had eradicated Dracula, but the
group was unsuccessful. You can learn more

362
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:43,234
about Doctor Strange in our Doctor Fate vs Doctor
Strange episode. Morbius then formed a team

363
00:32:43,274 --> 00:32:48,178
of supernatural heroes with his former allies
called the Midnight Sons and together they

364
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:53,322
stopped Lilith, the mother of demons, and her
spawn, the Lilin, from plunging the earth into

365
00:32:53,402 --> 00:32:59,346
eternal darkness. During the fight against Lilith,
Michael's ex-fiancee, Martine, was killed and

366
00:32:59,386 --> 00:33:05,090
turned into a vampire herself, bringing him
more torment. Morbius put his mind to work

367
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:09,293
trying to find a cure for a zombie virus that
had entered Marvel's dimension through the

368
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:14,956
nexus of all realities in Manthing Swamp. Together
with the Midnight Suns, he helped contain a

369
00:33:14,996 --> 00:33:19,638
zombie outbreak, and he later teamed up with
the Lizard to try and permanently cure their

370
00:33:19,678 --> 00:33:24,621
conditions together at Horizon Labs, though
Michael inadvertently attacked the other scientists

371
00:33:24,721 --> 00:33:29,924
and was sent to the Rapt Prison before he could
finish his work. Recently, Michael was seen

372
00:33:29,984 --> 00:33:34,607
back in Europe, where a group of vampires captured
him and and mixed his blood with their own,

373
00:33:34,987 --> 00:33:41,071
creating a new breed of monsters. With Domino's
help, Michael defeated the new vampires and

374
00:33:41,111 --> 00:33:47,196
continued his journey across the earth in search
for a cure. Powers-wise, Morbius is a pseudo-vampire

375
00:33:47,276 --> 00:33:52,019
in that he has all the abilities of vampires
but none of their traditional weaknesses, except

376
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:57,503
for the thirst and a minor sensitivity to direct
sunlight. These abilities include superhuman

377
00:33:57,543 --> 00:34:03,884
strength, being able to lift one ton, superhuman
speed, especially in short bursts, night vision

378
00:34:03,944 --> 00:34:10,129
and a sensitivity to the smell of blood, a regenerative
healing factor, sharp fangs and claws, the

379
00:34:10,149 --> 00:34:16,054
ability to glide almost endlessly, he can mesmerize
people through prolonged eye contact with the

380
00:34:16,094 --> 00:34:21,138
duration of his influence depending on his victim's
willpower, he can occasionally create other

381
00:34:21,238 --> 00:34:27,904
pseudo-vampires, and he doesn't age being effectively
immortal. Morbius is also an incredibly gifted

382
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:34,473
biochemist and Nobel Prize winner. Silver, garlic,
religious relics, stakes through the heart,

383
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:39,757
all of that have no effect on him. His only
weakness being the fact that he needs human

384
00:34:39,817 --> 00:34:44,321
blood in order to maintain his strength. So
he can't turn into like a bunch of bats or

385
00:34:44,341 --> 00:34:49,065
anything like that? No. He can't like teleport
through shadows? No, I guess he doesn't have

386
00:34:49,305 --> 00:34:54,689
all of their powers. He just has most of their
powers. Okay, he's more like man bat than I

387
00:34:54,729 --> 00:34:59,293
realized. For some reason I thought Morbius
was a lot stronger than you know the one ton

388
00:34:59,353 --> 00:35:03,447
lifting strength. But I'm glad he's not. This
should be a good match, I think. Let me get

389
00:35:03,467 --> 00:35:09,970
into the history of Manbat. When Dr. Robert
Kirkland Langstrom, aka Kirk, was a young boy,

390
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:15,793
he made national headlines as a missing child
as he became trapped within a deep underground

391
00:35:15,853 --> 00:35:22,276
cavern for six weeks. He was eventually rescued
and began frightening other children, including

392
00:35:22,396 --> 00:35:28,007
a six-year-old Bruce Wayne, with stories of
the half-man... half-bat creatures he believed

393
00:35:28,047 --> 00:35:33,191
he had encountered in the cavern during his
time there. Kirk maintained an obsession with

394
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:39,357
bats as the years went on, and he attended Gotham
University to become a zoologist specializing

395
00:35:39,657 --> 00:35:45,682
in chiropterology, or the study of bats. It
was during his university years that he met

396
00:35:45,782 --> 00:35:51,947
and dated the chemist Francine Lee, with whom
he shared his ideas of how his bat studies

397
00:35:52,088 --> 00:35:58,343
could pioneer medical breakthroughs. After obtaining
his doctorate, Kirk became a zoologist and

398
00:35:58,383 --> 00:36:03,665
nocturnal mammals expert employed at the Gotham
Natural History Museum and he and Francine

399
00:36:03,705 --> 00:36:10,308
became engaged. After learning that he was slowly
becoming deaf, Kirk developed a serum derived

400
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:16,411
from bat gland extracts within his museum basement
lab that could benefit blind or deaf people

401
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:23,613
with enhanced hearing, granting them echolocation
like a bat. Kirk tested his formula on himself.

402
00:36:24,086 --> 00:36:30,851
which had the unintended consequences of mutating
him into a monstrous half-man half-bat hybrid,

403
00:36:31,292 --> 00:36:38,818
a man-bat with large leathery wings and razor-sharp
claws. Terrified by what he had done and overwhelmed

404
00:36:38,858 --> 00:36:44,884
by his enhanced senses, Kirk soon became aware
that criminals had broken into the museum above

405
00:36:44,924 --> 00:36:50,088
him. They were members of the Blackout Gang,
a stealthy group that was currently on the

406
00:36:50,148 --> 00:36:55,880
run from Batman. who you can learn more about
in our Batman vs. Moon Knight episode. Overcome

407
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:02,045
by his animal instincts, Kirk attacked the gang
alongside Batman, who assumed Kirk was a new

408
00:37:02,085 --> 00:37:08,189
fellow crime fighter. Kirk fled immediately
after, but ran into Batman multiple times over

409
00:37:08,229 --> 00:37:14,153
the coming days as Kirk attempted to steal chemicals
from around the city, desperate to find a cure

410
00:37:14,253 --> 00:37:16,094
before his animal mind took over.

411
00:37:21,446 --> 00:37:26,208
sleeping harmlessly during the day and only
going out at night to wreak havoc throughout

412
00:37:26,248 --> 00:37:31,710
the city. That's hilarious. Yeah, they kind
of like were roommates for a while. Batman,

413
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:37,212
who by this time had deduced that the creature
was Dr. Kirk Langstrom, attempted to work on

414
00:37:37,252 --> 00:37:43,095
an antidote and enlisted the help of Kirk's
fiance, Francine. Though they were successful,

415
00:37:43,475 --> 00:37:49,477
Manbette rejected the antidote, and in an effort
to prove her love, Francine took the Manbette

416
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:56,817
serum. transforming into She-Bat. These names,
man. Man-Bat followed the two bat creatures

417
00:37:56,837 --> 00:38:02,440
to Gotham Cathedral, where he forced them both
to take the antidote. Grateful to be human

418
00:38:02,521 --> 00:38:09,264
once again, Kirk and Francine got married soon
after, and Batman was Kirk's best man. Batman

419
00:38:09,364 --> 00:38:15,488
in his Batman costume? Yes. Yep. Interesting.
Okay. The antidote, however, was revealed to

420
00:38:15,508 --> 00:38:21,751
be impermanent, as days after his wedding, Kirk
transformed back into Man-Bat, and with his

421
00:38:21,891 --> 00:38:27,554
animal mind attempting to take control, he created
a more potent formula that would transform

422
00:38:27,594 --> 00:38:33,076
him into Man-Bat permanently. Batman stopped
him from taking it, however, and administered

423
00:38:33,096 --> 00:38:39,399
the antidote once again. Months later, Francine
reverted back to She-Bat, and Kirk helped Batman

424
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:45,234
track her down and administer the antidote to
her. Eventually, Kirk was able to develop a

425
00:38:45,354 --> 00:38:50,637
new formula that would allow him and his wife
to keep their human minds whenever they transformed.

426
00:38:51,117 --> 00:38:57,441
Kirk became a crime fighter and ally to Batman,
helping him as Man-Bat take down villains such

427
00:38:57,521 --> 00:39:04,525
as the Getaway Genius and Baron Time. The Langströms
later moved to Chicago to get away from Gotham

428
00:39:04,565 --> 00:39:10,188
City's criminal element, only to encounter and
defeat the likes of the Ten-Eyed Man and Dr.

429
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:15,842
Thanatogenos before moving to New York City.
While there, Kirk teamed up with Robin and

430
00:39:15,902 --> 00:39:20,884
Batgirl in order to stop a villain named the
Outsider who was attempting to kill members

431
00:39:20,964 --> 00:39:26,766
of the Bat family. The Langstrums eventually
became pregnant, and Kirk became a bounty hunter

432
00:39:26,806 --> 00:39:32,407
of sorts, capturing criminals in order to collect
the reward money for his growing family. As

433
00:39:32,467 --> 00:39:37,169
Francine went into labor, Kirk teamed up with
Etrigan the Demon, who you can learn more about

434
00:39:37,229 --> 00:39:42,519
in our Etrigan vs. Ghost Rider episode. to stop
the sorceress Morgan Le Fay from transforming

435
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:48,221
all of the hospital's babies into demons. Francine
gave birth to a healthy baby girl, whom they

436
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:54,364
named Rebecca. Now with a child to think of,
Kirk retired as madbat and began working in

437
00:39:54,404 --> 00:39:59,906
construction to support his family. News reports
of a bat creature terrorizing New York City,

438
00:39:59,926 --> 00:40:04,928
however, led him to question whether or not
he really had control over his transformations

439
00:40:04,948 --> 00:40:10,950
while he slept. He later discovered It was his
wife seeking freedoms from the new responsibilities

440
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:16,352
of motherhood. When the Langstroms realized
Rebecca suffered from acute hearing, Man-Bat

441
00:40:16,412 --> 00:40:22,193
attempted to steal chemicals once again to develop
a cure. Batman stopped him, however, and it

442
00:40:22,213 --> 00:40:27,935
was Superman who later helped Kirk find a cure
for his daughter. A short time after the Langstroms

443
00:40:28,015 --> 00:40:33,517
moved back to Gotham City, Kirk accidentally
made a miscalculation in the formula he and

444
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:38,590
his wife used to keep their human minds when
they transformed. and his animal mind took

445
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:44,554
over completely. He secretly returned to the
Batcave, leading Batman and Alfred to wonder

446
00:40:44,634 --> 00:40:50,258
if the Batcave was haunted. Batman eventually
found Man-Bat and attempted to use the antidote,

447
00:40:50,598 --> 00:40:55,661
but Kirk's mind was too far gone and it didn't
work. It wasn't until Man-Bat saw his daughter

448
00:40:55,701 --> 00:41:01,405
Rebecca that Kirk's mind was reawakened and
he was able to take control once again. Although

449
00:41:01,445 --> 00:41:07,447
after that, Kirk was forced to take the antidote
regularly to limit his now more intense transformations.

450
00:41:07,907 --> 00:41:13,188
After getting his job back at the Gotham Natural
History Museum, the long hours caused Kirk

451
00:41:13,248 --> 00:41:19,190
to forget to take his antidote, and he transformed
into an uncontrollable man-bat once again,

452
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:24,872
kidnapping Jason Todd in an attempt to transform
him into a bat hybrid before being stopped

453
00:41:24,912 --> 00:41:30,793
by the combined effort of Batman, Francine,
and Rebecca. The Langströms later had a son,

454
00:41:31,133 --> 00:41:37,311
Eren. who was born with a deadly illness due
to Kirk's and Francine's altered DNA. Francine

455
00:41:37,331 --> 00:41:44,293
was forced to inject Eren with the Man-Bat serum,
transforming him into a baby-bat hybrid permanently

456
00:41:44,613 --> 00:41:49,375
in order to save his life. Talia Al Ghul, who
you can learn more about in our Daughters of

457
00:41:49,395 --> 00:41:55,216
the Demon vs. Daughters of the Dragon dual episode,
later kidnapped the Langstrom family and threatened

458
00:41:55,236 --> 00:42:00,758
to kill them if they didn't give her the Man-Bat
formula, which they did, in which Talia used

459
00:42:00,798 --> 00:42:07,160
to create an army of bat-hybrid assassins known
as the Manbat Commandos. Later, while Francine

460
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,481
worked as a member of the Outsiders, serving
as their scientific advisor, Kirk realized

461
00:42:12,521 --> 00:42:18,563
he was able to control his Manbat transformations
at will. During the Blackest Night storyline,

462
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:24,545
Francine discovered a cure for her and her husband's
transformations, while also discovering that

463
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:29,952
if Kirk transformed one more time, he would
no longer be able to turn back into a human.

464
00:42:30,432 --> 00:42:36,538
Just as Kirk was about to take the cure, a battle
between Black Lantern Solomon Grundy and Bizarro

465
00:42:36,778 --> 00:42:42,703
injured Francine, and Kirk was forced to transform
one final time in order to protect and save

466
00:42:42,743 --> 00:42:49,569
his wife. In post-Flashpoint continuity, the
Manbat Serum originated as a lab-created airborne

467
00:42:49,649 --> 00:42:56,306
virus that plagued Gotham City before its accidental
creator, Dr. Kirk Langstrom, was able to derive

468
00:42:56,366 --> 00:43:02,668
an anti-virus by transforming himself into a
bat hybrid, once again, the Manbat. He took

469
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:08,009
a villainous turn for a while, allying himself
with Scarecrow during the Arkham Wars and serving

470
00:43:08,049 --> 00:43:13,211
as a member of the Crime Syndicate before joining
an anti-terrorism task force for the supernatural

471
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:18,272
organization, Shade, which you can learn more
about in our Frankenstein vs. Bloodstone episode.

472
00:43:18,712 --> 00:43:23,702
He was later a member of Woodrow Man's Justice
League Dark Team, during which time he became

473
00:43:23,742 --> 00:43:30,646
an expert on the science of magic. Powers-wise,
Manbat possesses flight thanks to his wings,

474
00:43:31,086 --> 00:43:37,650
as well as enhanced physicality, including superhuman
strength and agility. He has extremely sensitive

475
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:43,433
hearing that allows for echolocation, and he
can emit sonic blasts with his voice, capable

476
00:43:43,473 --> 00:43:49,677
of stunning his victims. He also has razor-sharp
claws on his hands and feet. He has a brilliant

477
00:43:49,717 --> 00:43:54,688
scientific mind, Though the longer he's in his
Man-Bat form, the harder it is for him to fight

478
00:43:54,708 --> 00:44:00,971
back against Man-Bat's pure, instinctual, and
animalistic mind. He can communicate with bats,

479
00:44:01,371 --> 00:44:06,654
and has a sensitivity to bright lights in his
Man-Bat form. That's Man-Bat. It's interesting,

480
00:44:06,694 --> 00:44:10,797
like, this Batman villain is not really crazy,
like, he's never been to Arkham Asylum or anything,

481
00:44:10,837 --> 00:44:16,280
so he seems quite different from the standard
Batman rogues. He's kinda like Morbius, where

482
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:21,474
he's basically more of a good guy who gets into
trouble. Yeah, he's a lot like Morbius except

483
00:44:21,874 --> 00:44:27,656
which one do you think came first? Obviously
Morbius. He came out in 1971. Oh Man-bat has

484
00:44:27,676 --> 00:44:33,257
him beat by one year. He came out in 1970. What
a rip-off. But once again But Marvel did it

485
00:44:33,317 --> 00:44:38,199
better because Morbius is a much cooler character
who's actually getting his own film Actually

486
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:44,100
Man-bat was going to be the villain of the Batman
and Robin sequel But that never happened as

487
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:48,141
long as Joel Schumacher didn't direct it. I'd
be down to see that I think he was gonna direct

488
00:44:48,161 --> 00:44:53,121
it actually. Eww Nah, that would be no good.
He would have had like nipples, like bright

489
00:44:53,161 --> 00:44:59,546
pink areolas, I think. So these characters are
like so similar then. Although you know what's

490
00:44:59,566 --> 00:45:04,110
interesting is that Morbius, although he was
essentially turned into like a bat vampire

491
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:09,535
creature, he doesn't have echolocation like
Manbat does. And that's why he's going to die.

492
00:45:09,555 --> 00:45:13,619
Well, let's find out. Now that we've got their
histories and abilities out of the way, let's

493
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:19,302
speculate on how one of the 1000 simulated matches
will go. The winner is determined by simulations,

494
00:45:19,582 --> 00:45:23,924
not the speculation, but it's fun to imagine
how this fight could play out. We don't set

495
00:45:23,964 --> 00:45:27,986
any rules for this match other than the characters
don't know anything about each other going

496
00:45:28,126 --> 00:45:33,108
in, except that the other character is a threat
that needs to be put down. And we say that

497
00:45:33,128 --> 00:45:38,510
they start off about 50 meters apart in an environment
that has no bearing on the match itself because

498
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:42,852
we don't take stats for the environment. Plus
certain characters have advantages in some

499
00:45:42,892 --> 00:45:47,014
environments over others, and we want these
characters to win on their own merit. So let's

500
00:45:47,034 --> 00:45:52,176
get into it. Morbius and Manbat meet on the
battlefield. Who goes first? I'm gonna say

501
00:45:52,196 --> 00:45:57,518
that Manbat does just because he's a little
bit more animalistic and wild. So he's gonna

502
00:45:57,538 --> 00:46:04,521
start off by soaring into the air and send out
the shriek that stuns Morbius. So Manbat's

503
00:46:04,561 --> 00:46:09,423
shriek is capable of stunning people? Yes. Yeah,
it can also like shatter windows and stuff.

504
00:46:09,603 --> 00:46:14,365
It's pretty powerful. Well, Morbius would be
particularly susceptible to that because he

505
00:46:14,445 --> 00:46:20,419
does have enhanced hearing. Exactly. Okay, so
Morbius, you know, he's like in pain, he's

506
00:46:20,459 --> 00:46:25,922
stunned, and Manbat, he's gonna use this opening
to just like dive bomb him, right? And he's

507
00:46:25,962 --> 00:46:31,785
gonna slash Morbius' torso, just leaving these
deep bloody gashes before taking off back into

508
00:46:31,825 --> 00:46:36,167
the air. That was a good opening, Salvo. And
Morbius is definitely gonna be feeling the

509
00:46:36,207 --> 00:46:41,049
attack, both audio and physical, but you know,
he's gonna be able to heal those slash wounds.

510
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:48,055
and he leaps up into the air at Manbat right
at him and digs his own sharp claws into Manbat's

511
00:46:48,095 --> 00:46:52,999
chest and holds on tight and reaches up and
just sinks his teeth into the creature's neck.

512
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:58,544
Wait, he's gonna bite his neck as they're flying
through the air? Yeah. Except that Manbat reacted

513
00:46:58,584 --> 00:47:03,789
to Morbius's claw attack with a barrel roll
as he's flying through the air, right? So that's

514
00:47:03,809 --> 00:47:10,214
gonna fling Morbius off of him towards the ground
before Manbat could get bit in the neck. Do

515
00:47:10,254 --> 00:47:16,057
a barrel roll! Exactly. Except Morbius isn't
gonna hit the ground, he can glide. So he's

516
00:47:16,097 --> 00:47:22,261
just gonna glide away from Manbat and just kinda
like disappear into the shadows. Shadows? What

517
00:47:22,301 --> 00:47:26,763
shadows? Well wherever there's light, there's
shadows. And wherever there's not light, there's,

518
00:47:27,104 --> 00:47:33,547
you know, also shadows. Okay? I mean, but you
can't hide from Manbat in the shadows though.

519
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:40,239
He has echolocation. So right when Morbius thinks
he's safe- Manbat's just gonna silently swoop

520
00:47:40,379 --> 00:47:45,523
in and just lift Morbius back into the air by
his hair. That long ass hair that's just easy

521
00:47:45,563 --> 00:47:51,868
to grab. But Morbius is smart, okay? So, when
he realizes that Manbat is able to detect where

522
00:47:51,908 --> 00:47:57,352
he is through echolocation, which Morbius would
know because he'd be able to hear the echolocation

523
00:47:57,392 --> 00:48:02,615
scream, and also he would know where Manbat
is at all times now that Manbat's bleeding

524
00:48:02,756 --> 00:48:07,418
because he could smell his blood. So, when Manbat-
thinks he's getting the drop on Morbius by

525
00:48:07,498 --> 00:48:12,800
swooping in to grab him by the hair. Morbius
counters by dashing to the side and slashing

526
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:18,681
through one of Manbat's wings and just fricking
turning it into shreds. No, that's right. Manbat's

527
00:48:18,701 --> 00:48:23,463
grounded. All right. So Manbat, he's probably
like screeching in pain. And honestly, that

528
00:48:23,503 --> 00:48:29,884
attack probably like made Dr. Langstrom lose
control over the animal mind within Manbat.

529
00:48:30,185 --> 00:48:36,326
So now it's no more Mr. Nice Manbat. All right.
He's gonna scurry across the ground and just

530
00:48:36,506 --> 00:48:41,448
lunge at Morbius, just like grabbing his jugular
in his jaws and just biting down really hard

531
00:48:41,488 --> 00:48:47,489
going for the kill. Holy shit. Except as Manbat
pounces on Morbius, uh, Morbius is gonna throw

532
00:48:47,509 --> 00:48:52,651
up his arms in- in self-defense, and Manbat
is only just gonna bite into his forearm instead

533
00:48:52,691 --> 00:48:59,333
of Morbius' neck. And with Manbat's bangs, you
know, like, deep into Morbius' forearm, Morbius

534
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:04,502
is gonna maneuver Manbat's head where he can
expose his neck. and Morbius just sinks his

535
00:49:04,542 --> 00:49:10,506
fangs into Manbat's neck and it's gonna drain
him of all of his blood and energy. So Manbat's

536
00:49:10,526 --> 00:49:15,609
like done, like Morbius just like freaking pushes
him off to the side and Manbat falls lippily

537
00:49:15,629 --> 00:49:20,231
to the ground cause he doesn't have anything
left, Morbius wins. Except Manbat, you know,

538
00:49:20,251 --> 00:49:25,294
he's not frail without his blood. In fact, he's
stronger now than he's ever been because since

539
00:49:25,354 --> 00:49:31,478
Morbius bit him, he's now a pseudo vampire Manbat.
No, no, except, no, that didn't. Nah. He's

540
00:49:31,558 --> 00:49:37,199
man-pseudo-vampire bat with like all white fur
and skin like red eyes and now with his own

541
00:49:37,239 --> 00:49:43,161
healing factor But like still all animal instinct.
He's more dangerous now than ever. Did you

542
00:49:43,201 --> 00:49:50,784
say man pseudo vampire bat? Yes, man pseudo
vampire bat So he's like a giant albino bat

543
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:59,390
now, but with vampiric tendencies. Yeah. So
Morbis is like, oh shit, I done fucked up Exactly,

544
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:04,533
but you know Morbius is also gonna be stronger
than he's ever been because he just got done

545
00:50:04,573 --> 00:50:10,416
feasting on the man bats blood So, you know,
he's like full of energy and before man meant

546
00:50:10,617 --> 00:50:16,340
what is it pseudo man's a pseudo vampire bat
Yes Before he could do anything Morbius speed

547
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:22,183
blitzes him and tackles him to the ground pinning
him down as Morbius looks into his eyes and

548
00:50:22,304 --> 00:50:28,504
Mesmerizes the creature into becoming docile
dude Morbius can't tame the animal mind within

549
00:50:28,544 --> 00:50:33,468
Manitou vampire bat. All right? Animals can't
be hypnotized, so they're not smart enough.

550
00:50:33,528 --> 00:50:39,654
OK, so as Morbius thinks he's hypnotizing Manitou
vampire bat, he's just going to stick his head

551
00:50:39,694 --> 00:50:45,198
out and bite right into Morbius's neck, just
ripping it out entirely and ending this match.

552
00:50:45,218 --> 00:50:50,783
So basically, Manitou vampire bat took advantage
of Morbius just staring at him and it did nothing.

553
00:50:51,164 --> 00:50:56,531
Exactly. Morbius tried and failed. But Morbius
wouldn't die from getting his throat ripped

554
00:50:56,591 --> 00:51:04,657
out. What? Um, but I'm thinking now that Man-Bat
has vampirism and he also has this mutagenic

555
00:51:04,757 --> 00:51:09,080
chemical in his blood that transformed him into
Man-Bat in the first place. I bet you like

556
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:15,384
in the comics, it probably somehow reacts with
Morbius's own blood disorder. So as Morbius

557
00:51:15,444 --> 00:51:22,609
heals his neck, he also sprouts giant bat wings
and sheds his outfit and he becomes his own.

558
00:51:23,082 --> 00:51:30,188
Man-pseudo-vampire bat-vampire. Man-pseudo-vampire
bat is probably horribly confused by what just

559
00:51:30,228 --> 00:51:37,774
happened. So man-pseudo-vampire bat-vampire
then attacks man-pseudo-vampire bat and rips

560
00:51:37,814 --> 00:51:45,607
his pseudo-man heart out of his vampire bat
chest. Okay, wait, whose heart got ripped out?

561
00:51:46,268 --> 00:51:52,353
The man, pseudo, vampire, bat, vampire? No,
no, the man, pseudo, vampire, man, bat. All

562
00:51:52,433 --> 00:51:59,058
I know is Marvel wins. You don't know shit,
like no one does anymore. Basically, there's

563
00:51:59,078 --> 00:52:05,404
these two giant albino, vampire, pseudo, man,
bats that are attacking each other. There's

564
00:52:05,424 --> 00:52:10,308
just so much cross contamination of like blood
conditions and viruses and shit. Who knows

565
00:52:10,348 --> 00:52:15,006
which one is which one anymore? But let's find
out who wins this scenario by running these

566
00:52:15,046 --> 00:52:19,721
character stats in 1000 simulations and coming
back with a winner. Let's do it!

567
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:31,215
That was unexpected. What was it again? Pseudo
vampire bat man? No, man pseudo vampire bat

568
00:52:31,255 --> 00:52:37,040
man. Oh, okay. I forgot. But we ran the stats
on these characters. Pretty comparable here,

569
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:41,624
as I figured it would be. It's definitely gonna
be a close match because these characters are

570
00:52:41,664 --> 00:52:47,329
nearly identical when it comes to things like
speed, evasiveness, strength, damage level,

571
00:52:47,629 --> 00:52:53,608
versatility. But it was determined that Morbius
is much more durable given that he has a regenerative

572
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:59,732
healing factor, whereas Manbat does not. Right,
but where Manbat did get the edge was in perception,

573
00:52:59,772 --> 00:53:05,095
thanks to his echolocation. That's something
that Morbius didn't have. Manbat also had a

574
00:53:05,135 --> 00:53:10,638
slight advantage when it came to range due to
his sonic shriek that he has. Morbius has some

575
00:53:10,678 --> 00:53:15,280
range with his whole mesmerization thing, but
it's not very much. The victim has to be kind

576
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:19,926
of in close proximity to see his gaze. So after
crunching these numbers and running the simulations,

577
00:53:20,226 --> 00:53:25,128
who do you think is gonna win this match, Jonathan?
Manbet, hopefully. I'm not sure, I know it's

578
00:53:25,148 --> 00:53:30,429
gonna be close. I really hope it's not the same
results that we got from our Instagram poll,

579
00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:36,611
in which 72% of our Instagram followers chose
Morbius. And I'm like, what? What are you guys

580
00:53:36,651 --> 00:53:42,473
doing? Like, Manbet is way cooler than Morbius.
I don't know how that happened. Manbet is just

581
00:53:42,533 --> 00:53:47,650
too simplistic of a character, I think. He's
not interesting enough to ever be that popular.

582
00:53:48,070 --> 00:53:53,352
Whereas Morbius, you know, he's a fucking vampire.
Vampires are cool. Morbius is like the least

583
00:53:53,472 --> 00:53:59,573
cool vampire in fiction. He's like a living
vampire. How lame is that? Like even other

584
00:53:59,613 --> 00:54:07,676
vampires hate him. It's interesting to me that
Manbat turned out to be not vampiric at all.

585
00:54:07,976 --> 00:54:11,437
I always thought like he'd bite other people
and turn them into Manbats themselves. No,

586
00:54:11,617 --> 00:54:16,450
it all comes down to his serum. Hence the lowered
popularity. hence these poll results. But let

587
00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:22,193
me go ahead and tell you who won. The winner
in the dual matchup between Manbat and Morbius

588
00:54:22,473 --> 00:54:33,897
is Morbius, the living vampire. It was fairly
close. It was 56.4% to 43.6%. So Morbius won

589
00:54:33,977 --> 00:54:42,061
564 matches out of a thousand compared to Manbat's
436 wins. I thought Manbat scored higher in

590
00:54:42,141 --> 00:54:47,386
more stat categories than Morbius. but Morbius
scored much higher when it came to durability.

591
00:54:47,866 --> 00:54:52,788
And intellect, since we reasoned that Man-Bat
isn't always consistent with how smart he is

592
00:54:52,948 --> 00:54:58,969
in that form. I forgot about intelligence. Shit.
At the end of the day, a brilliant human mind

593
00:54:58,989 --> 00:55:04,351
will always beat out a crazy animal mind. That's
just the food chain. Man-Bat turns into a nice

594
00:55:04,431 --> 00:55:09,312
snack for Morbius, and us Marvel fans get another
win. You guys have needed one of those for

595
00:55:09,332 --> 00:55:15,518
a while. DC is totally stomping you guys, so
congrats, I guess. Thanks man. I can't wait

596
00:55:15,558 --> 00:55:26,723
to see Morbius's rotten tomato meter. I'm sure
it'll probably also be at 56.4%. That's probably

597
00:55:26,763 --> 00:55:33,066
true, touche. That was pretty good. But that
does it for this duel guys. Let us know what
