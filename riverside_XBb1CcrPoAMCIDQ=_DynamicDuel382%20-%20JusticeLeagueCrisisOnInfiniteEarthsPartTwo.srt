This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:26,198 --> 00:00:31,202
a weekly show where we review superhero films
and debate the superiority between Marvel and

3
00:00:31,222 --> 00:00:37,187
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based
battle simulations. I'm Johnny DC. And I'm

4
00:00:37,207 --> 00:00:43,192
his twin brother Marvelous Joe. And in this
episode, we are reviewing the latest direct-to-video

5
00:00:43,252 --> 00:00:49,798
DC animated film, part two of a three-part trilogy,
Justice League, Crisis on Infinite Earths.

6
00:00:50,358 --> 00:00:55,098
Of course, it's based on a comic of the same
name. Was it as good as part one? We'll let

7
00:00:55,118 --> 00:00:58,859
you know later on in the review. Before that
we're going to break down the comic book movie

8
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:04,902
news from the past week, of which it's all Marvel
news. We got the Deadpool and Wolverine official

9
00:01:04,962 --> 00:01:10,984
trailer, and we also learned that Kraven the
Hunter has been pushed back to December. As

36
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:33,287
you guys have ever been a fan of dynamic duel,
you owe it to yourselves to check out the rankers

37
00:03:33,347 --> 00:03:38,429
podcast where you can listen to Jonathan and
I take a more holistic approach in their latest

38
00:03:38,469 --> 00:03:43,251
episode to the Marvel versus DC debate. It was
a whole lot of fun. I felt like it was a Marvel

39
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:48,153
and DC debate that Jonathan and I had been prepping
our entire lives for. So definitely check out

40
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:52,931
the rankers podcast. In fact, you know, Marvel
fans, if you have no interest in hearing a

41
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:57,293
review about Justice League Crisis on Infinite
Earths, I'd go check out the Rankers podcast

42
00:03:57,313 --> 00:04:03,915
right now. Honestly, even if you're a DC fan,
like that episode is better than Crisis on

43
00:04:03,975 --> 00:04:09,498
Infinite Earths, part two. I'm just going to
say it's a five star episode. Crisis on Infinite

44
00:04:09,518 --> 00:04:14,900
Earths, part two is not five stars. Definitely
check out the Rankers podcast. But with that

45
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:21,444
out of the way, quick to the no prize. A no
prize is an award Marvel used to give out to

46
00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:26,789
fans. Our version, the Dynamic duel No Prize,
is a digital award we post on Instagram for

47
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,174
the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week, we

48
00:04:31,334 --> 00:04:36,520
asked, what casting announcement for a Marvel
or DC film were you the most hyped about when

49
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:42,530
you first heard about it and why? And this is
coming off of the lackluster news of... the

50
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,873
Jonathan and Martha Kent casting in the Superman
movie. But we thought it was a fun question.

51
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:50,556
We got a lot of great answers. So let's go ahead
and run down our honorable mentions as well

52
00:04:50,596 --> 00:04:56,821
as the no prize winner. Our first honorable
mention goes to Travis Herndon, who said, What's

53
00:04:56,861 --> 00:05:02,246
up, Dynamic Dudes? Travis here. Shout out to
my twins. So my pick would have to be Christian

54
00:05:02,266 --> 00:05:06,489
Bale. I mean, when I heard that Christian Bale
was going to be gore to God butcher, I was

55
00:05:06,549 --> 00:05:12,958
excited. I was high. Granted, Christian Bale
didn't look exactly like gore. go into comics

56
00:05:13,078 --> 00:05:17,801
and Love and Thunder was underwhelming to say
the least. But come on, we have to admit we

57
00:05:17,821 --> 00:05:22,104
were all hyped when we heard Christian Bale
as Gore the God Butcher. Yeah, I remember being

58
00:05:22,264 --> 00:05:27,507
thrilled because Christian Bale is such a fantastic
actor and Gore the God Butcher is an equally

59
00:05:27,547 --> 00:05:32,570
fantastic villain for Thor. I thought the next
Thor movie was going to be the next Batman

60
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,513
Begins or something like that. And that did
not happen. We'll say that. Nope, nope, nope.

61
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:43,824
No, honestly, I cannot admit that I was excited
for Kushra Bell's casting. I felt horribly

62
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:47,766
betrayed and heartbroken when I learned that
he was in a Marvel movie. I was like, what

63
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:53,329
are you doing? Well, DC had moved on from his
Batman at that point, so it was only fitting

64
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:57,111
that he comes over to Marvel's side. I just
wish that the character of Gore would have

65
00:05:57,131 --> 00:06:01,293
been done more justice. Not that his portrayal
of Gore was bad. It was just that the movie

66
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:06,324
was so. off. If anything, Christian Bale was
actually the best part of Thor 11th Thunder,

67
00:06:06,524 --> 00:06:11,467
but you know, being the best part of a turd
sandwich is still not great. Yeah, he absolutely

68
00:06:11,507 --> 00:06:15,669
was the best part. But I do have to ask you,
how would you feel if like, Toby Maguire came

69
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:21,292
over to DC and played like Ted Kord or something?
Toby Maguire is probably my least favorite

70
00:06:21,452 --> 00:06:27,616
Spider-Man actor, so I would not care. Okay,
what if Hugh Jackman came over to DC and played,

71
00:06:27,636 --> 00:06:33,074
I don't know, Brainiac? Oh, that would be weird.
I mean, he'd be so covered in prosthetics,

72
00:06:33,114 --> 00:06:38,176
I'd imagine that he'd be almost unrecognizable.
I would be interested in seeing that, for sure.

73
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:43,817
You only say that because you don't know what
it's like to be heartbroken, like I do. Great

74
00:06:43,877 --> 00:06:50,039
answer, Travis. Our next honorable mention goes
to Gilly Macho, who said, What up guys, Gilly

75
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:55,280
Macho here. And the announcement I was most
excited for was Jon Berthold as the Punisher.

76
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,114
We've all seen Walking Dead, and I was a big
fan of the Shane character. And when I heard

77
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:06,156
he was coming to be the Punisher, you knew that
Blood and Gore was coming with him. So yep,

78
00:07:06,697 --> 00:07:11,779
John Berthold as the Punisher. Yeah, I was thrilled
by this news. I had watched the first season

79
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:16,461
of Walking Dead and that was my first exposure
to the actor, John Bernthold. And when they

80
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:22,023
announced his casting, I immediately was super
hyped because even though I liked Ray Stevenson

81
00:07:22,203 --> 00:07:26,865
as the Punisher, who played the character most
recently prior to this casting, John Bernthold.

82
00:07:27,474 --> 00:07:32,137
just felt more like Frank Castle to me. You
know, he had that rage that he portrayed so

83
00:07:32,157 --> 00:07:37,661
well in The Walking Dead. And also he seemed
more Italian, which The Punisher is. And it

84
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:43,665
just felt perfect. Yeah. Like everything you've
said, same, except I think I saw two seasons

85
00:07:43,705 --> 00:07:48,889
of The Walking Dead. John Bernthal was a fantastic
actor. And yeah, I think in all of the fan

86
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:54,673
castings for an upcoming Punisher film or television
series, everyone was pushing him for the role,

87
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:59,582
including me. Yeah, I'm really glad that he's
coming back for the Daredevil born again series,

88
00:07:59,623 --> 00:08:03,864
or, you know, he's heavily rumored to appear
again. I think he just captures the character

89
00:08:04,144 --> 00:08:09,125
on a deeper level than any previous Punisher
actor has. For sure. Yeah, absolutely. Great

90
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:15,507
answer, Gilly. Our next honorable mention goes
to Judson Batty, who said, Hi guys, Judson

91
00:08:15,547 --> 00:08:20,788
Batty here. I would say that the casting decision
I was most excited about was Pierce Brosnan

92
00:08:20,908 --> 00:08:25,714
as Dr. Fate in Black Adam, because I wasn't
too hyped in the movie beforehand. But when

93
00:08:25,794 --> 00:08:31,559
they cast a James Bond actor who was really
good, I knew that at the very least, no matter

94
00:08:31,579 --> 00:08:36,223
how shit the rest of the film turned out to
be, Dr. Fate would be done well. And just really

95
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:41,728
made me excited for it. Leave it to the Brits
to say that a James Bond actor was the one

96
00:08:41,748 --> 00:08:45,891
they were the most excited for. But you know
what? I am right there with you, man. I am

97
00:08:45,931 --> 00:08:49,855
a huge fan of James Bond as people who have
listened to this podcast for a long time know.

98
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:56,123
And I was just seething with jealous rage. when
Pierce Brosnan was cast as Dr. Fate because

99
00:08:56,143 --> 00:09:01,545
DC also got Timothy Dalton to play the chief
in the Doom Patrol television series and like

100
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:06,887
I'm wondering when a Bond actor is going to
join Marvel. Freaking never. I know that's

101
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:11,469
so heartbreaking. At one point I believe Daniel
Craig was going to play Baldur the Brave and

102
00:09:11,489 --> 00:09:17,491
he had to back out but hopefully they find a
good role for Daniel Craig in a Marvel movie.

103
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:23,838
He's still my fan cast choice for Despero if
they ever do Despero in a DC movie. I'll take

104
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:28,320
George Lazenby at this point too. I mean, Sean
Connery is still alive and he's done LXG, so

105
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:35,564
you think he'd be up for a Marvel movie? Oh,
LXG, another DC imprint film. Damn it! Ha ha!

106
00:09:37,005 --> 00:09:40,847
Ugh, James Bond actors are breaking my heart
over here. But in regards to Pierce Brosnan

107
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:45,850
as Dr. Fate, yeah, I was super stoked when I
heard this news as well. Pierce Brosnan is

108
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:51,433
absolutely the kind of quality actor you'd want
in a role that's sort of somewhat generic as

109
00:09:51,493 --> 00:09:56,407
Kent Nelson. He could really bring that character
to life in a way that hasn't been done in the

110
00:09:56,427 --> 00:10:01,449
comics. Also, I knew his voice was going to
be fantastic for the character of Dr. Fate,

111
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:07,612
and I was not wrong. He was awesome. Yeah, Pierce
Brosnan delivered on the hype for him in the

112
00:10:07,652 --> 00:10:11,894
role. I think the movie gets undeserved flak
because I thought it was pretty entertaining

113
00:10:11,934 --> 00:10:17,876
overall. And I was definitely pleased with Pierce
as Dr. Fate. It's actually a shame that he

114
00:10:17,896 --> 00:10:21,886
won't be playing the character anymore, I think.
Yeah, well, I mean... For two reasons, one

115
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:27,489
because the character died in the movie and
also because the DCEU is over. But Gilly's

116
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:33,813
brother Scotty also gave Pierce Brosnan as Dr.
Fate for his answer. So shout out to Scotty.

117
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:38,656
I thought that was kind of coincidental too.
Yeah, out of all the casting people just really

118
00:10:38,696 --> 00:10:44,680
love Pierce Brosnan. Yeah, who doesn't? But
the winner of this week's No Prize is Colby

119
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:51,448
Hentges who said, Hey boys, Colby Hentges. The
Marvel DC casting I was most hyped for was

120
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:57,613
Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson. He had done the
van Wilder and the waiting movie. So I knew

121
00:10:57,633 --> 00:11:02,116
he could do the sophomore humor stuff. He did
the blade Trinity. So I knew he could do the

122
00:11:02,156 --> 00:11:07,820
comic book action stuff. You guys, I went into
Wolverine origins. So hype.

123
00:11:13,227 --> 00:11:18,311
Only to be let down so much, at least in that
film. Yeah, so hyped and then so disappointed.

124
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:23,316
X-Men Origins Wolverine was horrible and they
really fucked up the character of Deadpool.

125
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:28,941
So it was really nice when seven years later,
Ryan Weld's got the chance to do the character

126
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:33,526
justice in his own movie. He's pretty much the
perfect casting and he's a fan of the character.

127
00:11:33,806 --> 00:11:40,051
He exemplifies Deadpool to a T. It's actually
hard to imagine. Deadpool now without Ryan

128
00:11:40,071 --> 00:11:44,415
Reynolds voice. I think when I read Deadpool
comics nowadays He just so embodies the character

129
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:49,359
in a way that few actors are able to do You
know Robert Downey Jr. Did it Hugh Jackman

130
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:54,103
did it and I think you could add Ryan Reynolds
to that list And now that the MCU has lost

131
00:11:54,403 --> 00:11:59,888
some of their a-list talents like Robert Downey
Jr I really think that Ryan Reynolds is the

132
00:11:59,928 --> 00:12:05,332
biggest name that the MCU currently has in their
acting roster So I'm glad that he's able to

133
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:10,816
pick up some of the slack with this year's Deadpool
and Wolverine movie. That's true, actually.

134
00:12:11,357 --> 00:12:16,000
Yeah, I wonder if one of the reasons that Marvel
isn't drawing as big of audiences as they used

135
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:21,103
to is just the lack of star power. It's possible.
An actor like Robert Downey Jr. can draw a

136
00:12:21,143 --> 00:12:25,346
crowd on his own. And nowadays that kind of
pool just doesn't exist quite like it used

137
00:12:25,366 --> 00:12:30,149
to. Which is interesting because some people
accuse Marvel of killing off the movie star.

138
00:12:30,658 --> 00:12:34,600
People were caring more about the characters
as opposed to the actors playing them. But

139
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:39,622
yeah, maybe now actors matter more than people
realize. So great answer Colby, you win this

140
00:12:39,642 --> 00:12:43,684
week's No Prize. Congrats on that. If you the
listener want a shot at winning your own No

141
00:12:43,724 --> 00:12:48,167
Prize, stay tuned to later on this episode when
we'll be asking another question of the week.

142
00:12:48,647 --> 00:12:50,948
And now that that's done, onto the news!

143
00:12:56,470 --> 00:13:02,674
All right, this past week we got the trailer
for Deadpool and Wolverine. And while the first

144
00:13:02,814 --> 00:13:08,178
teaser focused more on Deadpool and the TVA
and kind of set up the situation that he would

145
00:13:08,198 --> 00:13:13,542
be going through, they only really teased that
shot of Wolverine in the shadows as he stabbed

146
00:13:13,642 --> 00:13:17,425
Deadpool at the end of the teaser. We didn't
get a whole lot of Wolverine action in that

147
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:23,789
first preview. But in this trailer, they really
build upon the Deadpool and Wolverine relationship.

148
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:28,849
Oh, yeah, this trailer is almost entirely all
Wolverine, which is fitting considering, you

149
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:34,134
know, Wolverine shares the title with Deadpool.
So I'm not surprised that they dedicated a

150
00:13:34,174 --> 00:13:40,840
trailer mostly to him. Like, there's very few
Deadpool jokes in this trailer. Right. Yeah.

151
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:47,165
So it wasn't as funny, but I think it's just
so hype inducing to see Hugh Jackman back in

152
00:13:47,185 --> 00:13:51,969
the role, especially in that comics. Accurate
costume. Yeah, I was actually pretty happy

153
00:13:52,009 --> 00:13:56,578
to see him. with no sleeves, because I didn't
love the yellow sleeves when we first got like

154
00:13:56,598 --> 00:14:01,143
the set photos. But yeah, I'm glad to see that.
I'm just wondering if we're going to get to

155
00:14:01,163 --> 00:14:05,568
see the mask before the movie comes out or if
they're going to make us pay to see it. Oh,

156
00:14:05,588 --> 00:14:10,513
they're probably going to make us pay to see
the mask for sure. The trailer starts off with.

157
00:14:10,954 --> 00:14:15,356
Wolverine in a bar similar to when we very first
saw the character in the first X-Men movie

158
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:19,518
that came out in the year 2000, which I thought
was pretty fitting. And it was just so jarring

159
00:14:19,538 --> 00:14:23,180
to all of a sudden see Deadpool's stupid face
pop in the shot. And he's like, hey, Peanut,

160
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:27,423
that was pretty good. And Wolverine's like,
lady, I don't have time for this. Started out

161
00:14:27,443 --> 00:14:31,865
with a bang. But then the trailer kind of goes
into dark territory because we see that this

162
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:36,267
particular variant of Wolverine, I'm not sure
if it's the same Wolverine that was in the

163
00:14:36,347 --> 00:14:41,622
Logan movie or if it's a different multiversal
version of the character, but Basically, it

164
00:14:41,662 --> 00:14:49,386
seems like he let his entire universe down somehow
by letting the X-Men die. Now, we see a shot

165
00:14:49,546 --> 00:14:56,249
of this version of Wolverine standing, I think,
next to a bunch of tall monuments, maybe tombstones.

166
00:14:56,289 --> 00:15:00,911
They kind of look like some of the Sentinel
ships from the Days of Future Past movie. So

167
00:15:00,971 --> 00:15:06,854
it could be like a Sentinel situation that killed
all of his friends in the X-Men or If it's

168
00:15:06,894 --> 00:15:11,896
the same version of Wolverine from the Logan
movie, then it was actually Professor X who

169
00:15:11,956 --> 00:15:16,959
had like a seizure and killed the rest of the
X-Men. It's hard to say. I'm inclined to believe

170
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:21,202
that this is not the Logan version just because
it wasn't Wolverine's fault that the X-Men

171
00:15:21,262 --> 00:15:26,444
died in that movie. Well, they can make it Wolverine's
reason that Professor X perhaps had the seizure.

172
00:15:26,905 --> 00:15:31,307
Like he failed to get his medication on time
or, you know, something like that. Something

173
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:36,298
like that, yeah. I am inclined to think it's
the Logan version only because He suffered

174
00:15:36,338 --> 00:15:43,001
from the same like claw ejection problem that
Rogan had in that movie. Yeah, he had ejectile

175
00:15:43,021 --> 00:15:49,303
dysfunction. Right. Yeah. He doesn't later on
in the trailer, though. And it is glorious

176
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:54,906
to actually see those claws pop out of his blue
gloved hand with those like little metallic

177
00:15:54,966 --> 00:15:59,128
slits, mirrors, knuckles. It's glorious. Yeah.
Just think him take swipes to Deadpool, which

178
00:15:59,188 --> 00:16:03,089
actually, I guess, is an Easter egg call out
to the first Spider-Man movie. There's quite

179
00:16:03,109 --> 00:16:09,393
a few. Easter eggs in this trailer, like there
was dog pool and Ant-Man's or Giant Man's helmet.

180
00:16:09,853 --> 00:16:15,937
It took me a few viewings to catch quite a few
of them because everything happens so fast.

181
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:21,340
Oh yeah, there's a huge cast of characters in
this from, you know, Lady Deathstrike, Zazel,

182
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:26,964
we see Callisto from X-Men 3. There's a ton
of characters here, both from the Fox X-Men

183
00:16:26,984 --> 00:16:32,747
franchise and, you know, with Ant-Man from the
MCU. We even see the guys jump from Ant-Man's

184
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:37,369
skull into a Dr. Strange portal. So it's possible
that Dr. Strange is even in this movie, which

185
00:16:37,409 --> 00:16:42,592
would be wild to see. That moment when they're
jumping out of the eye into the portal with

186
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:47,195
Madonna's like a prayer playing, like I got
chills. Like I just, I cannot wait to see this

187
00:16:47,695 --> 00:16:51,978
in the theater. I'm so pumped. I hope it's not
Dr. Strange that makes a cameo. I hope it's

188
00:16:52,038 --> 00:16:59,041
Wong's friend Madison, who like got his sling
ring. I hope it's Wong, now that you said that.

189
00:16:59,598 --> 00:17:04,079
I think that'd be hilarious. It probably will
be the guys everywhere in this phase. He's

190
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:09,280
made a lot of cameos like She Hulk, Shang Chi
for sure. The movie comes out in theaters July

191
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:14,362
26th, and all I have to say is, let's fucking
go, let's fucking go. Did this trailer sell

192
00:17:14,382 --> 00:17:18,683
you on the movie? Like, do you want to see another
trailer after this? Yes, I would love another

193
00:17:18,723 --> 00:17:23,844
trailer, actually. Although I don't need one.
I just kind of want some more context into

194
00:17:23,884 --> 00:17:26,885
what the movie is about, because I feel like
we haven't really gotten that too much yet.

195
00:17:27,205 --> 00:17:31,727
Yeah. I didn't like this trailer as much as
the first one, so yeah, I'm still hoping to

196
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:37,050
get one that really merges the humor of Deadpool
with the action of Wolverine. More so than

197
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:41,512
either of these two trailers did. I'm sure we
will get another trailer after this, and I'm

198
00:17:41,532 --> 00:17:46,074
sure it'll be more of a story trailer. Yeah,
that'd be cool. Maybe something more with Cassandra

199
00:17:46,094 --> 00:17:50,836
Nova. She was cool to see in this trailer as
well. Yeah, she looks like she's gonna be pretty

200
00:17:50,856 --> 00:17:56,303
formidable. You know, being Professor X's sister.
But speaking of all these different characters

201
00:17:56,323 --> 00:18:00,515
that appeared in the Deadpool and Wolverine
trailer that brings us to our question of the

202
00:18:00,555 --> 00:18:00,816
week.

203
00:18:05,362 --> 00:18:11,268
Other than Wolverine and the characters that
you saw in the trailer, what Fox X-Men character

204
00:18:11,308 --> 00:18:16,453
do you most hope appears in Deadpool and Wolverine
and why? There's a lot to choose from, both

205
00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:21,978
from the Patrick Stewart Ian McKellen era, the
James McAvoy Michael Fassbender era, the previous

206
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:27,624
Deadpool movies, the Wolverine movies, the new
Mutants movie, there's a lot going on here,

212
00:18:49,702 --> 00:18:56,104
before May 4th. In other news, we learned this
past week that Craven the Hunter, the movie

213
00:18:56,164 --> 00:19:01,394
being produced by Sony in the Sony Spider-Man
universe, has been pushed back from August

214
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:08,637
30th, 2024 to December 13th, 2024. So it's no
longer a summer release. It's now a Christmas

215
00:19:08,677 --> 00:19:14,360
time release. And I think if they just keep
pushing this movie back, that would be the

216
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,622
best thing for everyone. I mean, this is its
fourth release date, right? I think so. Yeah,

217
00:19:19,642 --> 00:19:24,464
it's been pushed back quite a bit. I know initially
it was supposed to come out for October of

218
00:19:24,504 --> 00:19:29,866
2023. But then I think the studio wanted to
have Aaron Taylor Johnson promote it. and he

219
00:19:29,906 --> 00:19:34,747
couldn't due to the strike at the time. So yeah,
they pushed it back to this year and it just

220
00:19:34,767 --> 00:19:39,928
keeps getting pushed back. Honestly, I wasn't
surprised by this pushback. This fall seems

221
00:19:39,968 --> 00:19:45,310
kind of crowded for comic book films and there
really isn't anything comic book related being

222
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:50,051
released in December, which tends to be a good
money making month. I just don't know about

223
00:19:50,491 --> 00:19:54,472
this film making money during the holiday season
because it looks like it's gonna be kind of

224
00:19:54,532 --> 00:20:00,607
violent. Yeah, but that might be the best thing
about it, honestly. because as Sony has shown

225
00:20:00,707 --> 00:20:06,991
us with recent releases like Madame Web and
Morbius and Let There Be Carnage, the studio

226
00:20:07,011 --> 00:20:12,295
is just not really great at making the Spider-Man
spinoff movies and it doesn't seem like they're

227
00:20:12,315 --> 00:20:15,797
really going anywhere. At first, Sony was really
pushing the idea of all these movies being

228
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:19,900
interconnected and they kind of backpedaled
on that, especially since the release of Madame

229
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:25,644
Web and stated like oh, this is kind of like
in its own separate standalone universe thing

230
00:20:26,004 --> 00:20:29,930
because really nobody's liking these movies.
And if they say that they're all connected,

231
00:20:30,251 --> 00:20:34,873
people are even less inclined to go see them.
Wait, so you're telling me that we're not going

232
00:20:34,893 --> 00:20:41,057
to see Morbius and Vulture and Craven and everyone
team up? It's looking like that's likely not

233
00:20:41,077 --> 00:20:45,980
going to be the case. That's embarrassing. I
feel bad for Sony. Holy cow. I feel bad for

234
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,622
Sony, too. Not really, though. They kind of
shut the bed and they should be forced to sleep

235
00:20:50,642 --> 00:20:55,085
in it now. Yeah. And then eventually just give
the Spider-Man rights back to Marvel. That's

236
00:20:55,105 --> 00:20:59,696
what we want to see, right? Very true. I have
very little hope for this movie, which is a

237
00:20:59,776 --> 00:21:03,860
shame because I am a big fan of the character
of Craven the Hunter. If you want to learn

238
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,843
more about him, if you haven't read about him
in the comics, go ahead and check out our Vixen

239
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:13,488
vs Craven the Hunter duel episode. But speaking
of James Bond earlier, the rumor is that Aaron

240
00:21:13,508 --> 00:21:17,772
Taylor Johnson is going to be the next James
Bond. So part of me kind of hopes that Craven

241
00:21:17,792 --> 00:21:21,555
the Hunter does really well at the box office
so that he doesn't lose that chance because

242
00:21:21,595 --> 00:21:26,730
I do think that Aaron Taylor Johnson would make
a good Bond. but if this movie bombs, he might

243
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,811
be seen as box office poison. I don't know.
I don't know if I buy him his Bond. I think

244
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:35,132
he's too short. You know who should be Bond?
Theo James. I was talking about this with a

245
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:41,014
guy at work. Theo James should be Bond. Fuck
no! That James Franco lookalike guy? What?

246
00:21:41,594 --> 00:21:47,216
I don't like it. Plus, he's like already 40
years old. It wouldn't work. Isn't Aaron Taylor

247
00:21:47,256 --> 00:21:56,251
Johnson like close to 40? No, he's 33. Fuck!
Why do I feel so old? Anyway, off the topic

248
00:21:56,271 --> 00:22:00,876
of James Bond, I guess ultimately I'm pushing
for Craven the Hunter to do well and be good.

249
00:22:01,356 --> 00:22:02,457
It's not, don't worry about it.

250
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:14,117
But I guess that does it for all the news for
this week. So let's move on to the main event

251
00:22:14,157 --> 00:22:20,267
of this episode where we review the animated
film Justice League, Crisis on Infinite Earths

252
00:22:20,568 --> 00:22:21,189
Part 2.

253
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:43,007
Justice League Crisis on Infinite Earths Part
2 is the second of a 3-part animated film saga

254
00:22:43,287 --> 00:22:50,953
that itself is the conclusion of a 10-part animated
film universe known as the Tomorrowverse. Though

255
00:22:50,993 --> 00:22:56,518
the Crisis trilogy actually has ties going back
to the previous DC animated movie universe

256
00:22:56,758 --> 00:23:04,544
that began with Justice League The Flashpoint
Paradox in 2013. Now the DC AMU had a phenomenal

257
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:10,167
and heartbreaking ending. in the animated film
Justice League Dark Apocalypse War, which we

258
00:23:10,187 --> 00:23:15,970
gave a 5 star review, despite the fact that
its ending was somewhat ambiguous. Considering

259
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:22,053
that it could be argued the Crisis on Infinite
Earth trilogy is 11 years in the making and

260
00:23:22,073 --> 00:23:27,155
there are some rumors it will lead straight
into James Gunn's new DC universe that includes

261
00:23:27,235 --> 00:23:33,350
animated films, I feel like I should be a whole
hell of a lot more excited about Crisis. But

262
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:38,171
it's really hard to be considering the way the
producers have structured the stories. And

263
00:23:38,211 --> 00:23:43,833
make no mistake, there is a structure, as you
can now see easter eggs across the Tomorrowverse

264
00:23:43,873 --> 00:23:51,095
films and even some DC animated shorts. But
so far, the whole is the sum of its parts,

265
00:23:51,175 --> 00:23:56,597
and if you've been following our reviews of
the Tomorrowverse films, despite a few exceptions,

266
00:23:56,957 --> 00:24:02,415
the parts aren't that great. and are only marginally
made better by the story reveals that come

267
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:09,477
perhaps too little too late. Now, I don't want
to spoil those reveals for anyone, so if you

268
00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:14,398
haven't seen Crisis on Infinite Earths Part
2, well, I'm guessing you haven't seen Part

269
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:19,039
1 either, and maybe you're just waiting until
Part 3 comes out later this year to hear whether

270
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:24,961
the whole thing is worth investing your time.
I can't really say Part 2 is worth your time

271
00:24:25,301 --> 00:24:30,524
because it feels very much like a mere stepping
stone to get to part three. It's just something

272
00:24:30,544 --> 00:24:35,708
you kind of have to get through. And honestly,
I really wish that wasn't the case. Yeah, my

273
00:24:35,748 --> 00:24:41,492
first impression after seeing Crisis on Infinite
Earths part two was that the story seemed to

274
00:24:41,552 --> 00:24:46,816
kind of be treading water as we went into the
third part. The first movie I thought was really

275
00:24:46,856 --> 00:24:51,540
interesting from a narrative perspective with
the Flash kind of skipping through time. The

276
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:57,107
second movie also did a lot of time skipping.
So it seems to be kind of like a theme within

277
00:24:57,167 --> 00:25:03,351
this trilogy of films to not tell the story
linearly. It just kind of makes everything

278
00:25:03,511 --> 00:25:08,753
a little bit disjointed and hard to follow and
not as enjoyable as it necessarily could be.

279
00:25:09,214 --> 00:25:15,217
Well, yeah, the time skipping in this film happened
only in the first half of it. After that, everything

280
00:25:15,337 --> 00:25:20,220
was pretty much happening in real time or not
real time, but in the present, I should say.

281
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,775
I really wanted to like this movie because like
you, I really liked part one, again despite

282
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:32,001
its unconventional story structure. The second
film in a lot of trilogies is arguably the

283
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:38,746
best. You know, the Dark Knight, Empire Strikes
Back, The Two Towers is perfection. This film,

284
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:44,691
not so much. You forgot Spider-Man 2 and X-Men
2. Hey, you know, that's also valid. But this

285
00:25:44,731 --> 00:25:50,416
film is not better than the first one, though
due to the hit or miss nature of the Tomorrowverse,

286
00:25:50,876 --> 00:25:56,427
I shouldn't be surprised. It is very much the
second act of a three-part story, though the

287
00:25:56,467 --> 00:26:02,750
second act is supposed to be the most exciting
act as it ramps up to the climax. Narratively,

288
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:09,093
you set up the conflict in Act 1, in Act 2 the
conflict escalates until it reaches its maximum

289
00:26:09,133 --> 00:26:15,436
potential, and Act 3 is a come down from that
high where order is restored. Now obviously

290
00:26:15,456 --> 00:26:20,854
in the trilogy, conflict and action will continue
into the third film. but I feel like this film

291
00:26:20,874 --> 00:26:25,757
didn't pack enough of a punch to get me excited
for the third one. And I honestly have a hard

292
00:26:25,797 --> 00:26:32,261
time reconciling why that is. I mean, the main
characters in this film were legitimately interesting,

293
00:26:32,421 --> 00:26:38,344
I felt. Supergirl, Monitor, Psycho Pirate were
my favorite parts of the film. Like, I found

294
00:26:38,404 --> 00:26:43,567
Supergirl way more interesting in this film
than I did in Legion of Superheroes. And the

295
00:26:43,607 --> 00:26:49,299
central theme of how emotions develop in us
and affect us was fairly strong throughout

296
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:54,963
the movie. It was just everything with the other
heroes and around the towers that I felt dragged

297
00:26:55,023 --> 00:27:00,667
the film down. Like I hated what they did with
Batman here. He didn't learn any kind of lesson

298
00:27:00,707 --> 00:27:06,532
about teamwork or camaraderie or family, and
he should have by the end. Like the cameos

299
00:27:06,552 --> 00:27:12,696
they had, like Batman Beyond, Commandy, John
Constantine, were all so small and didn't amount

300
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:17,508
to much, if anything at all. The film just didn't
know how to juggle its characters in a way

301
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:22,852
that was as satisfying as the strong single
narrative focus that they had with The Flash

302
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:28,977
in Part 1, or the character ensemble that was,
say, Avengers Infinity War. Or Justice League

303
00:27:28,997 --> 00:27:33,801
Dark Apocalypse War. That movie, I think, had
a huge cast, just as large as this one, but

304
00:27:33,821 --> 00:27:39,285
it just juggled everything better. Yeah, absolutely.
Another problem with the film, I feel, were

305
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:44,506
the stakes. Like in the first film, you really
felt the threat of the end of the world. a

306
00:27:44,606 --> 00:27:50,050
lot more than he did here, I feel. Like, any
time there was an antimatter wave that passed

307
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:55,655
over, the threat was pretty much non-existent
for the most part. Yeah, I was never really

308
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:59,538
nervous for any of the worlds and, you know,
I knew that there were just so many Earths

309
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:03,921
that the characters could regroup at. No one
single Earth mattered compared to the whole

310
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:08,305
of the multiverse, you know? So, the movie's
premise kind of works against itself in that

311
00:28:08,505 --> 00:28:13,843
regard. But really, this movie seems to be more
of a character study than anything else, really

312
00:28:13,883 --> 00:28:18,824
focusing on, you know, Supergirl, Psycho Pirate,
and the Monitor. Yeah, and I feel like that's

313
00:28:18,984 --> 00:28:25,846
not a great approach for a massive epic event
film. I mean, it's not like in the comic book

314
00:28:25,886 --> 00:28:30,067
Crisis on Infinite Earths, we got backstories
for like Psycho Pirate or anything like that.

315
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:34,508
I don't know if it was the right approach here.
It's interesting, for sure, but it doesn't

316
00:28:34,528 --> 00:28:40,434
really lend itself to epic storytelling, I guess.
Yeah. If anything, the character studies take

317
00:28:40,494 --> 00:28:44,957
away from the overarching narrative that you
would expect in a big, multiversal crossover

318
00:28:44,997 --> 00:28:50,220
event. Absolutely, absolutely. Now, I liked
this film. I'm ragging on it, but it wasn't

319
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:56,664
terrible. It doesn't get me excited for part
three, but it is, as I mentioned earlier, a

320
00:28:56,724 --> 00:29:02,287
stepping stone to get there. So it's something.
Outside of that, I don't have much to say about

321
00:29:02,327 --> 00:29:07,322
the film that I haven't said about part one
and other Tomorrowverse films. You know. The

322
00:29:07,342 --> 00:29:12,164
first act premises are strong, but the story
does always stick the landing. The voice acting

323
00:29:12,224 --> 00:29:17,827
is great. The character designs are great. The
animation can be a little bit sticky. Right.

324
00:29:17,907 --> 00:29:22,910
But yeah, if you've listened to our reviews
of DC animated films recently, you've heard

325
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:27,573
it all before. Let's go ahead and talk about
the main characters in the movie in our character

326
00:29:27,613 --> 00:29:34,437
breakdown, starting with Supergirl slash Kara
Zor-El. Now, Meg Donnelly does a fantastic

327
00:29:34,497 --> 00:29:41,446
job voicing Supergirl. I was really rooting
for her to play Supergirl in James Gunn's DCU,

328
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:47,931
but she lost out to Milly Alcock and I'm not
gonna lie, I was disappointed. Yeah, the actress

329
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:52,094
was great in the Legion of Superheroes movie,
which is really more of a Supergirl movie,

330
00:29:52,495 --> 00:29:57,359
and she was great here. I think she brings a
lot of emotional weight to the character, just

331
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:01,602
like she did in the Legion of Superheroes animated
movie, which was not a great film, but she

332
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:07,450
was definitely the best part of that, I think.
Yeah, I agree. We learn that immediately after

333
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:13,253
Krypton's destruction, Supergirl was begrudgingly
rescued by the Monitor, who had observed the

334
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:19,755
death of the planet. Supergirl, suffering from
amnesia, was raised by the Monitor for timeless

335
00:30:19,796 --> 00:30:24,878
decades before she realized that he knew about
what happened to her homeworld, at which point

336
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:30,740
she left him due to his apathy. Despite him
later imparting some of his power to her in

337
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,699
order for her to gather an army to protect the
multiverse, Her distrust and anger toward the

338
00:30:35,739 --> 00:30:41,403
monitor continued to grow, allowing Psycho Pyre
to manipulate her to where she ultimately kills

339
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:47,647
the monitor. Her arc revolves around loss, you
could say. The loss of her mom, loss of her

340
00:30:47,747 --> 00:30:54,191
world, loss of time with her cousin, loss of
the Legion, and ultimately a loss of control

341
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:58,994
over everything that's happening in her life
and the universe. and all of that feeling of

342
00:30:59,054 --> 00:31:05,015
loss results in her ultimately losing a father
figure at her own hands. It's pretty tragic.

343
00:31:05,376 --> 00:31:08,817
For sure, yeah. Everything that Supergirl has
gone through has been quite heartbreaking.

344
00:31:09,037 --> 00:31:13,258
I guess I am a little bit confused though what
happened when the monitor imparted some of

345
00:31:13,298 --> 00:31:18,279
his power onto her. I thought that was going
to transform her into Harbinger. It did transform

346
00:31:18,339 --> 00:31:23,301
her into Harbinger. She could just go in and
out of her Harbinger mode when she's traversing

347
00:31:23,321 --> 00:31:27,666
the multiverse. Actually, that's one of the
more interesting changes they d- made to the

348
00:31:27,706 --> 00:31:33,251
crisis story because in the comic harbinger
is Lila Michaels a separate character from

349
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:39,415
Supergirl and Lila does end up being manipulated
by the anti-monitor into killing the monitor

350
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:45,640
in the comics but here the way they sort of
wrote around that and having Supergirl angry

351
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:51,485
at monitor and blaming him for things like the
destruction of Krypton it was really well written

352
00:31:51,765 --> 00:31:56,816
I thought. Yeah, the movie is able to kind of
retcon and streamline the crisis on Infinite

353
00:31:56,876 --> 00:32:00,338
Earth's movie in a really interesting way. For
sure. That's probably the best thing about

354
00:32:00,378 --> 00:32:05,621
it. Even though the execution isn't always successful,
you have to admire the approach. With almost

355
00:32:05,781 --> 00:32:10,884
every film in the Tomorrowverse, you could say
that. Yeah, yeah. It's like everything sounds

356
00:32:10,924 --> 00:32:15,086
good on paper, and then somewhere it just gets
botched along the way, which is unfortunate,

357
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:19,069
because it's like the Tomorrowverse should be
so much better than it is. It really should

358
00:32:19,109 --> 00:32:25,947
be. It really should be. Moving on to Monitor
aka MaruNoVu, he was voiced by Jonathan Adams,

359
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:32,189
who delivers a very understated performance,
appropriately so. I thought he was perfect

360
00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:37,370
in this role. And the guy apparently has a lot
of experience playing god-like characters.

361
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:44,152
Like he's voiced Darkseid, Galactus, Dormammu,
King the Conqueror. He's just a fantastic voice

362
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:50,822
actor. What a badass. Totally, right? What a
resume. Now the Monitor's arc revolves around

363
00:32:50,982 --> 00:32:57,045
Supergirl and the feelings he develops not just
for her, but life in the multiverse as a whole,

364
00:32:57,185 --> 00:33:03,928
because of her, enter inspirations and criticisms
that spur him to reject his calling and take

365
00:33:04,088 --> 00:33:09,350
action to protect everything. He assumes the
antimatter waves bombarding the multiverse

366
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:15,333
are a natural phenomena, but by the end he learns
that not only are they coming from a specific

367
00:33:15,393 --> 00:33:21,985
individuel, the Anti-Monitor, but that everything
that has transpired is perhaps his fault. I

368
00:33:22,025 --> 00:33:27,349
imagine the next film will get a flashback as
to why the anti-monitor hates the monitor,

369
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:33,154
and I'm really curious to see how much influence
recent comics like The Dark Side War or Dark

370
00:33:33,174 --> 00:33:40,380
Knight's Metal will have on the story. Why does
DC feel the need to rip off Marvel and characters

371
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:45,844
like The Watcher with like this enigmatic race
of beings who are sworn only to observe and

372
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:50,408
not interfere with the cosmic level events.
The fuck's that about? That's straight from

373
00:33:50,448 --> 00:33:55,832
the Crisis comic. And? All right, let's find
out who came first. Obviously, the Watcher

374
00:33:55,852 --> 00:34:01,556
came first. He came out in the 60s. Crisis was
an 80s book. Be more original is what I guess.

375
00:34:01,576 --> 00:34:07,800
Yeah, I guess he came out in 1982. Damn it.
But I mean, he just looks cooler, you know?

376
00:34:08,241 --> 00:34:15,522
Like, what's with the giant bald head of the
Watcher? Weird. Looks like a big baby. What

377
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:20,706
do you think it is that Monitor ended up developing
empathy? I think it was because he was never

378
00:34:20,806 --> 00:34:26,430
as close to anyone as he was to Supergirl. He
always tried to keep his distance. But because

379
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:32,836
of satellite's actions, his sentient spaceship
as it were, he was forced into a position where

380
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:39,281
he either cared for this young woman that was
rescued or he just callously eject her back

381
00:34:39,321 --> 00:34:44,885
out into space. I don't think he liked the idea
of her death because he was more aware of her

382
00:34:44,945 --> 00:34:50,348
individuel existence compared to the nameless
victims of Krypton. And I think he just developed

383
00:34:50,448 --> 00:34:55,352
what is it called, propinquity. You know, where
you develop feelings for the people you are

384
00:34:55,392 --> 00:35:01,576
closest in proximity to. I think it's as simple
as that. Moving on to Psycho Pirate, aka Charles

385
00:35:01,616 --> 00:35:08,841
Halsted. He was voiced by Jeffrey Arren. And
I know this guy. He was in 500 Days of Summer.

386
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:14,715
He was in the Ringer, in Garden State, in a
bunch of TV shows. I did not know he did voice

387
00:35:14,795 --> 00:35:19,917
acting and he did a fantastic job with Psycho
Pirate, though, you know, based on his history,

388
00:35:19,937 --> 00:35:25,538
he probably should have had an English accent.
But that aside, yeah, Jeffrey Arendt, great

389
00:35:25,578 --> 00:35:31,000
voice. His voice, I have to say, is pretty damn
haunting. Like, I think out of all the main

390
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:36,541
characters in this movie, he was the most interesting
every time he was talking about his backstory

391
00:35:36,561 --> 00:35:41,411
or just speaking in general. I was pretty much
hooked. Oh yeah, it was really interesting.

392
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:46,774
What I found most interesting early on was that
they didn't go with the Roger Hayden version

393
00:35:46,874 --> 00:35:51,317
of the character, like the one I talked about
in our last episode. They went with Charles

394
00:35:51,377 --> 00:35:57,380
Halstead, who they not only made a metahuman
empath, you know, removing any reference to

395
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:04,544
the Medusa mask, but they also made him a multiversal
entity who's gone by names such as Dr. Spectro

396
00:36:04,844 --> 00:36:10,315
or Rainbow Raider in different universes. Which
was hilarious because we saw Dr. Spectro in

397
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:15,078
the Blue Beetle animated short that ties into
this film and he's playing with people's emotions.

398
00:36:15,398 --> 00:36:20,160
Yeah, that was interesting. It also serves to
solve one of the questions that you and I had

399
00:36:20,501 --> 00:36:24,943
regarding the Justice Society World War II movie.
Because I remember we were bitching in that

400
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:30,446
movie about why Psycho Pirate didn't have his
Medusa mask and how like the Medusa mask would

401
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:34,788
have made a great artifact MacGuffin for that
film and everything like that. But yeah, this

402
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:39,586
version of the character never used the Medusa
mask. all his empathic abilities were due to

403
00:36:39,646 --> 00:36:44,908
his metahuman nature. Dude, so I was listening
to our review of Justice Society World War

404
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:52,770
Two in lead up to writing this review, and we
were so wrong about so many things. Like, not

405
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:57,031
only were we bitching about a psycho pirate,
we were bitching about Wonder Woman and how

406
00:36:57,051 --> 00:37:02,633
she'll probably never be seen in another movie
again. It was just so many things. Well, like,

407
00:37:02,773 --> 00:37:07,595
how are we supposed to know? We weren't we weren't.
But because Justice Society World War Two took

408
00:37:07,615 --> 00:37:13,580
place in another timeline and we weren't sure
how that would fold into like the main tomorrow

409
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:18,324
versus timeline. But as it turns out, there
really isn't a main tomorrow versus timeline.

410
00:37:18,344 --> 00:37:22,948
You could say it's Earth one. But no, you're
right. We had no way of knowing that this was

411
00:37:22,968 --> 00:37:29,093
going to happen. It does make my review like
pretty obsolete, though, I would say. There

412
00:37:29,113 --> 00:37:33,897
are so many things I got wrong in it. It's embarrassing.
This movie doesn't make me like that movie

413
00:37:33,937 --> 00:37:39,159
anymore. I don't want to say it redeems the
movie, but it does address some of the criticisms

414
00:37:39,259 --> 00:37:44,742
we had about the film. Now the original backstory
they created for Charles Halstead in this film

415
00:37:44,942 --> 00:37:50,804
was wild. His actions in the movie stem from
the fact that he simply hates people because

416
00:37:50,824 --> 00:37:56,007
he's constantly feeling their emotions and feels
that the world would be better if everyone

417
00:37:56,047 --> 00:38:01,549
just felt what he was feeling all the time.
He's an interesting character at times being

418
00:38:01,629 --> 00:38:08,375
somewhat sympathetic. Well, also at times shockingly
evil. And I'd say it's probably an upgrade

419
00:38:08,395 --> 00:38:13,277
to what we got in the Crisis on Infinite Earth's
comic. Yeah. Well, I mean, this origin story

420
00:38:13,317 --> 00:38:17,338
just seemed better than the comics version of
his origin that we learned last week, where

421
00:38:17,518 --> 00:38:22,219
basically the guy just hated his boss and so
became like an expert on emotions or some stupid

422
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:29,802
shit. It's so dumb. Yeah. That scene where the
dude killed all his classmates and. the German

423
00:38:29,862 --> 00:38:34,763
officers came into the school and they saw all
these students hanging from the ceiling. That

424
00:38:34,803 --> 00:38:39,304
shit was nightmare fuel. Like, I remember watching
that and thinking, like, when the fuck did

425
00:38:39,324 --> 00:38:43,886
this become a horror film? Oh, my God. Oh, yeah,
it was straight out of the horror genre. That

426
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:49,727
was wild. I do kind of miss the Medusa mask,
though. Like, I generally like a lot of the

427
00:38:49,747 --> 00:38:53,889
character designs, really like the character
designs of the Tomorrowverse characters, but

428
00:38:54,029 --> 00:38:58,842
not Psycho Pirate. I don't like being able to
see his. face as much as I do. I'm used to

429
00:38:58,942 --> 00:39:03,424
not seeing his face in the comics. Well, the
Medusa mask is just such a cool concept, you

430
00:39:03,444 --> 00:39:09,187
know, where it like portrays an emotion that
is projected onto its victims. Yeah, it's just

431
00:39:09,227 --> 00:39:14,969
a great visual that you think would do really
well in a medium like movies, you know, for

432
00:39:15,009 --> 00:39:20,091
sure, for sure. I can't wait to see that adapted
into live action. That'll be so cool. Just

433
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:26,210
like this liquid gold mask. Hell, yeah. If they
choose to do that, they should. Psycho pirate

434
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:30,835
is a really great villain that just needs to
be adapted. Heck, based off of this origin,

435
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:35,319
I could see like a psycho pirate live action
movie, a la The Joker, where it's just like

436
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:41,526
focused around him. I guess. I don't know. It
could be a horror film. Why not? Hmm. I'd watch

437
00:39:41,586 --> 00:39:43,908
it. I wouldn't because I don't like horror movies.

445
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:42,531
But I think that does it for the character breakdown,
now let's move on to the story highlights.

446
00:40:43,011 --> 00:40:47,712
The film begins with Joker and several other
Batman rogues attacking the tower that allows

447
00:40:47,752 --> 00:40:52,914
the planet to become intangible and avoid the
waves of antimatter that are destroying entire

448
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:58,395
universes. With help from Bat family members
from across the multiverse, Earth-1 Batman

449
00:40:58,495 --> 00:41:05,757
stops the Joker, though Batman disapproves of
the other's help. Now, this was a pointless

450
00:41:05,977 --> 00:41:11,495
opening to the film. Like, I understand that
Batman is a draw commercially, but when you

451
00:41:11,535 --> 00:41:16,737
have him just being a dick to everyone else,
it's not fun to watch. Right. Yeah, you want

452
00:41:16,757 --> 00:41:23,059
to see the Bat family kicking gas, you know,
united and working together. It's kind of a

453
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:29,341
downer when you see Batman just being an asshole.
Really, the whole Batman storyline was inessential

454
00:41:29,461 --> 00:41:33,895
to the entire narrative. And I don't know why
they kept revisiting it because he seemed no

455
00:41:33,935 --> 00:41:38,197
more important than any other single other universe
that was protecting their own tower. Right,

456
00:41:38,277 --> 00:41:44,101
right, exactly. And in that regard, you know,
cameos like Batman Beyond, which were really

457
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:48,103
used to help sell this movie in the trailers
and stuff like that, we got really excited.

458
00:41:48,563 --> 00:41:53,546
That all felt kind of hollow and empty when
it just seemed kind of gratuitous. Oh yeah,

459
00:41:53,926 --> 00:41:58,829
man, I was really excited, honestly, for Batman
Beyond, especially because Will Friedle was

460
00:41:58,869 --> 00:42:05,129
returning to voice the role. he only got like
literally two lines. He also voiced Commandy

461
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:10,733
and he had way more lines as that character
than he did as Batman Beyond, which was unfortunate.

462
00:42:11,213 --> 00:42:17,098
I guess you could rationalize Batman's behavior
in this film though as a sort of coping method

463
00:42:17,178 --> 00:42:22,742
with witnessing the death of James Gordon. He
didn't want to lose anyone else close to him.

464
00:42:23,262 --> 00:42:27,926
Although maybe that's not true because he wasn't
close to that version of James Gordon. and

465
00:42:27,966 --> 00:42:33,710
he definitely wasn't close to all of his adoptive
children from other multiverses. He freaking

466
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:39,655
admitted to taking Dick Grayson back to the
orphanage in his universe. That's messed up.

467
00:42:40,056 --> 00:42:45,060
Yeah, it kind of makes it feel like not my Batman,
right? Because like, right, my Batman would

468
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:51,465
take on a ward in Dick Grayson. Who the fuck
is this guy? For sure, for sure. Now in a flashback

469
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:57,578
to World War Two on Earth Two, Psycho Pirate
converses with an imprisoned Dr. Fate. recounting

470
00:42:57,598 --> 00:43:03,322
his childhood as an empathic metahuman who absorbed,
amplified, and reflected the emotions of those

471
00:43:03,382 --> 00:43:08,125
around him. Another flashback follows that goes
all the way back to the destruction of Krypton,

472
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:14,810
observed from a distance by the monitor in his
satellite ship, which notices and rescues Supergirl

473
00:43:14,870 --> 00:43:20,574
amidst Krypton's ruin. Why do you think Dr.
Fate gave Psycho Pirate the ability to traverse

474
00:43:20,674 --> 00:43:25,157
among the multiverse? We don't know that yet.
I'm hoping we'll learn that in the third film.

475
00:43:25,462 --> 00:43:29,986
But I'm guessing it has something to do with
either a change of heart that comes from the

476
00:43:30,006 --> 00:43:35,570
Psycho Pirate or some kind of... I don't know.
He's needed for some reason. Like, it's his

477
00:43:35,691 --> 00:43:40,495
fate to be able to traverse the multiverse.
So, of course, Dr. Fate got involved and gave

478
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:45,579
him that ability. You think Psycho Pirate will
be redeemed in the third film? He certainly

479
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:51,164
was not in the comic. So, I don't know. I could
see them going either way. Did this scene with

480
00:43:51,204 --> 00:43:55,915
Dr. Fate redeem... the character at all for
you from the Justice Society World War II movie.

481
00:43:56,976 --> 00:44:02,979
A bit. He was much cooler in this film, partly
because we actually got to see him as Dr. Fate

482
00:44:02,999 --> 00:44:07,542
in all of his glory. Now going back to Psycho
Pirates' past, his parents shipped him off

483
00:44:07,562 --> 00:44:12,304
to a boarding school in Bavaria, where he suffered
under the amplified aggression of the school

484
00:44:12,344 --> 00:44:18,868
boys. Over time he managed to control his power
and used it to kill, humiliate, and control

485
00:44:18,968 --> 00:44:24,260
everyone in his school. Meanwhile, Monitor,
initially annoyed by Supergirl's presence,

486
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:29,324
helped her recuperate and began teaching her
about the multiverse and his ancient race who

487
00:44:29,384 --> 00:44:34,949
observe events in the multiverse. As timeless
decades pass, Supergirl eventually finds her

488
00:44:34,969 --> 00:44:40,613
Kryptonian ship on the satellite and is devastated
when she remembers Krypton's destruction. When

489
00:44:40,653 --> 00:44:46,378
Supergirl confronts Monitor, he reveals that
her younger cousin is still alive as Superman

490
00:44:46,778 --> 00:44:52,334
and Supergirl leaves Monitor, angry, to go to
her cousin. Now I like the rationale they had

491
00:44:52,394 --> 00:44:57,456
for why Superman is older than Supergirl in
this universe. It's because she was aboard

492
00:44:57,536 --> 00:45:02,458
the monitor ship where time does not pass. I
thought that was a great reasoning. Yeah, considering

493
00:45:02,498 --> 00:45:08,061
that she was older when Krypton exploded and
K'Hellel was just a baby. Exactly. The character

494
00:45:08,101 --> 00:45:12,543
of Satellite was pretty interesting. He was
like a more humanized version of Hell 9000

495
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:18,885
from 2001 of Space Odyssey. Yeah, yeah, he looked
pretty menacing with that like single eyeball.

496
00:45:19,222 --> 00:45:24,004
But it turns out he was just a big old softy
who cared for Kara. He was like, whoops, I

497
00:45:24,064 --> 00:45:29,266
accidentally saved her life. He had more empathy
than the monitor did. And it was almost like

498
00:45:29,286 --> 00:45:34,068
he was trying to teach the character of the
monitor how to care about things. Yeah, I thought

499
00:45:34,088 --> 00:45:38,050
the same thing. You almost have to wonder if
he was being manipulated by the presence at

500
00:45:38,090 --> 00:45:43,072
all, because the specter at the end explicitly
said that the presence wanted the monitor to

501
00:45:43,152 --> 00:45:48,624
feel empathy. Interesting, interesting. Now
the Psycho Pirate recounts his time as a Nazi

502
00:45:48,664 --> 00:45:54,269
pirate captain whose ship sank and while adrift
at sea, discovered Atlantis, using his power

503
00:45:54,309 --> 00:45:59,493
to manipulate Aquaman and his kingdom into being
Nazi allies, as we saw in the film Justice

504
00:45:59,513 --> 00:46:04,838
Society World War II. As Psycho Pirate concludes
his story, he learns that his powers have no

505
00:46:04,898 --> 00:46:10,623
effect on Dr. Fate before Dr. Fate teaches Psycho
Pirate a magic spell that would allow him to

506
00:46:10,663 --> 00:46:16,664
travel to other universes. Meanwhile, As Monitor
observes the first waves of universe destroying

507
00:46:16,744 --> 00:46:22,047
antimatter, he also observes Supergirl's heroic
actions at the conclusion of the Legion of

508
00:46:22,128 --> 00:46:27,972
Superheroes film and is inspired to take action,
summoning her to a satellite once again where

509
00:46:28,012 --> 00:46:32,915
he imbues her with a portion of his power to
allow her to also traverse the multiverse as

510
00:46:32,955 --> 00:46:39,520
his harbinger and collect heroes in order to
save it. Does Dr. Fate usually recite his spells

511
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:44,199
in Latin? Seems like more of a Constantine thing,
right? Yeah, I don't usually see Dr. Fate,

512
00:46:44,359 --> 00:46:48,201
you know, reciting incantations in the same
way that John Constantine does. That's more

513
00:46:48,241 --> 00:46:54,385
of an occult thing, whereas Dr. Fate is more
like artifact based, I would say. And Dr. Strange

514
00:46:54,405 --> 00:46:59,448
just says a bunch of nonsense, like the hoary
hosts of Hoggeth, like stuff Stan Lee invented.

515
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:01,829
Yeah, those hosts of Hoggeth are hoary.

516
00:47:05,706 --> 00:47:10,688
As the Justice Society emerges victorious back
in World War II, Psycho Pirate escapes to a

517
00:47:10,748 --> 00:47:16,591
new universe where he's encountered by Harbinger
and asked to aid in the protection of the multiverse.

518
00:47:17,031 --> 00:47:22,453
In the present, Superman witnesses a new wave
of antimatter approaching and heroes from across

519
00:47:22,493 --> 00:47:27,996
the multiverse activate their towers to protect
their universes, including the post-apocalyptic

520
00:47:28,036 --> 00:47:33,450
world of the Atomic Knights, saved by Superman
and Supergirl. the latter of whom is still

521
00:47:33,491 --> 00:47:38,674
concerned with the monitor's initial apathy
toward Krypton's destruction and the erasure

522
00:47:38,834 --> 00:47:43,358
of the future timeline that included her friends
in the Legion of Superheroes, which we saw

523
00:47:43,378 --> 00:47:48,402
at the end of Crisis Part 1. Yeah, I think we
hypothesized at the end of Crisis Part 1 that

524
00:47:48,562 --> 00:47:54,666
anyone who was from a future timeline got erased,
but it turns out that just their specific universes

525
00:47:54,686 --> 00:47:59,798
got erased. Right, exactly, because we still
see characters like Baman beyond. Right. While

526
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:05,401
Commandi is returned to his own post-apocalyptic
Earth alongside the intelligent ape Solovar

527
00:48:05,681 --> 00:48:11,305
to protect its tower, Psycho Pirate manipulates
Monitor into giving him a portion of his power

528
00:48:11,665 --> 00:48:17,149
in order to more effectively maintain the heroes'
emotions as they continually work to protect

529
00:48:17,189 --> 00:48:22,452
their worlds. As the heroes monitoring things
from the satellite speculate someone may be

530
00:48:22,492 --> 00:48:28,026
behind the waves of antimatter, They also deduced
that they could potentially move all the worlds

531
00:48:28,067 --> 00:48:33,168
to nether space with enough energy. When Blue
Beetle confronts Psycho Pirate, the villain

532
00:48:33,228 --> 00:48:38,770
is transported away by the Anti-Monitor. I have
a question, why does DC have so many intelligent

533
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:44,411
ape characters? You know, there's Gorilla Grodd,
there's the Ultra Humanite, and now we have

534
00:48:44,571 --> 00:48:50,373
Solovar. Solovar is like Gorilla Grodd's rival
from Gorilla City. That does not answer my

535
00:48:50,413 --> 00:48:57,862
question. Because in DC Comics, you know, there
is Gorilla City and it's entirely full of intelligent

536
00:48:57,962 --> 00:49:03,406
apes that have evolved. Solovar being one of
them. I knew as soon as he showed up that Command

537
00:49:03,426 --> 00:49:08,689
D was not going to have it. Well, yeah, considering
that Command D is based on Planet of the Apes

538
00:49:08,749 --> 00:49:13,993
or was inspired by it, I should say, it was
kind of funny to have Solovar there. But that's

539
00:49:14,013 --> 00:49:18,376
straight from the Crisis comic as well. Wait,
Command D played a role in the Crisis comic?

540
00:49:18,796 --> 00:49:23,508
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Interesting. The Tomorrowverse
was laying all these clues with the shorts

541
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:27,711
they decided to create and stuff like that as
to the direction that the franchise was going

542
00:49:27,731 --> 00:49:33,696
to go. We just never saw the crisis story coming.
No. As the heroes of the multiverse prepare

543
00:49:33,716 --> 00:49:39,321
for a new wave, this time it leaves behind hordes
of shadow demons on each world that attack

544
00:49:39,361 --> 00:49:45,746
the heroes and the towers. Meanwhile, the Anti-Monitor
promises Psycho-Pirate an entire universe to

545
00:49:45,786 --> 00:49:51,266
control in exchange for helping put a stop to
the Monitor and his heroes. As Batman gets

546
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:56,407
overwhelmed by shadow demons, members from the
Bat Family from other worlds come to his aid

547
00:49:56,507 --> 00:50:01,689
once again, and together they determine Bright
Light destroys the demons. And once again,

548
00:50:01,989 --> 00:50:08,110
Batman's completely a dick to these guys. As
Wonder Woman, Commandee, and others protect

549
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:14,052
their towers, Psycho Pirate begins broadcasting
feelings of hate and distrust across the multiverse,

550
00:50:14,332 --> 00:50:19,333
causing heroes such as the Bat Family, Green
Lantern and Dr. Light, and the Amazons to turn

551
00:50:19,393 --> 00:50:24,419
against each other. When Supergirl attacks a
shadow demon, her physical contact with it

552
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:30,101
allows PsychoPirate to project an illusion in
her mind of her being with her loved ones and

553
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:35,402
coming to the conclusion that the monitor caused
the destruction of Krypton and everything bad

554
00:50:35,442 --> 00:50:40,944
that has happened since. Now I'm not going to
lie, this whole Supergirl illusion thing was

555
00:50:41,084 --> 00:50:46,279
super confusing because she was talking to PsychoPirate
in one moment. then she was helping her cousin

556
00:50:46,299 --> 00:50:50,962
fight shadow demons in another, then all of
a sudden she's back on Krypton with the Legion

557
00:50:51,002 --> 00:50:55,946
and her mom, then Krypton is kind of destroyed
behind her, and then she's with Psycho Pirate

558
00:50:56,006 --> 00:51:02,372
again. It's weird. As heroes across the multiverse
continue to fight, a homeless man is revealed

559
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:07,476
to be John Constantine, with help from the Green
Lantern John Stewart. When Monitor confronts

560
00:51:07,556 --> 00:51:13,301
Psycho Pirate about what he's doing, he escapes
to another universe, just as another wave emerges

561
00:51:13,381 --> 00:51:18,495
on the horizon. Many worlds are destroyed, including
the world of the Amazons and Atomic Knights,

562
00:51:18,815 --> 00:51:23,936
though some heroes manage to overcome their
wrath to activate their towers in time. So

563
00:51:24,116 --> 00:51:30,518
Wonder Woman is dead now, right? It's ambiguous.
Her Tiara lived, and she mentioned earlier

564
00:51:30,538 --> 00:51:36,440
that she was immortal, so I don't know if that
means that allowed her to survive. I will give

565
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:42,181
you a spoiler. In the extras for this film,
they show a preview for part 3 in which she

566
00:51:42,281 --> 00:51:50,304
is still alive. that could take place timeline
wise before she dies here? I have no idea.

567
00:51:50,364 --> 00:51:55,408
But I think that Tiara is a clue that she's
still alive. As the monitor observes everything

568
00:51:55,428 --> 00:52:00,233
that's happening, he is approached by the spectre
who implies that he will suffer for his millions

569
00:52:00,273 --> 00:52:06,259
of years of apathy. When the shadow demons across
the multiverse leave for Earth 1, there they

570
00:52:06,299 --> 00:52:12,272
combine to form a colossal sized anti-monitor.
The emergence of the Anti-Monitor reveals to

571
00:52:12,312 --> 00:52:16,655
the Monitor and the Spectre that everything
that has happened is the Monitor's fault and

572
00:52:16,715 --> 00:52:22,220
as punishment, he allows Supergirl to kill him.
When the heroes attacks on the Anti-Monitor

573
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:28,525
fail, Supergirl realizes what she has done and
holds the Monitor's dead body. The film ends

574
00:52:28,605 --> 00:52:35,911
with the Anti-Monitor charging up a massive
energy attack, which is hella anti-climactic.

575
00:52:35,951 --> 00:52:40,410
For real. My wife is like, that was the end?
Really? I'm like, any other, you know, they're

576
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:45,613
setting up a part three, but you're right. It
just kind of ended in a way that didn't feel

577
00:52:45,653 --> 00:52:51,476
like an ending. No, no. I mean, they should
have just ended it with Supergirl holding monitor.

578
00:52:51,596 --> 00:52:55,978
Like they didn't need the whole charge up attack
because if you're not going to finish that,

579
00:52:56,999 --> 00:53:01,742
why then? Why do it? Especially considering
we still don't have a release date for part

580
00:53:01,822 --> 00:53:06,444
three. Like we know it's coming out this year,
but who knows how many months he'll have to

581
00:53:06,484 --> 00:53:14,031
charge that damn thing. It's gonna be one massive
attack. Although the anti-monitor himself seems

582
00:53:14,131 --> 00:53:18,633
less threatening than an anti-matter wave that's
tearing through the universe. Right, especially

583
00:53:18,673 --> 00:53:23,735
considering the fact that the heroes were actually
able to physically, not necessarily harm him,

584
00:53:23,875 --> 00:53:28,858
but affect him. You know, cause like his mouth
is screaming, he's like, ah. Right. But you

585
00:53:28,878 --> 00:53:33,559
know, they couldn't do that to an anti-matter
wave. We'll see how it plays out. I have high

586
00:53:33,619 --> 00:53:39,562
hopes for the next film, the third in the trilogy.
I hope it ends with a bang. But I realize I

587
00:53:39,582 --> 00:53:45,446
have to temper my expectations considering the
past quality of the Tomorrowverse film universe.

588
00:53:45,946 --> 00:53:51,689
Yeah, considering the inconsistent quality of
this series of films, these crisis movies almost

589
00:53:51,749 --> 00:53:56,032
require audience members to have seen every
single movie in the Tomorrowverse to get a

590
00:53:56,072 --> 00:54:01,055
lot of the context behind what's going on here.
Like, even in this film, little things like

591
00:54:01,095 --> 00:54:06,014
the scene of Supergirl trying to find Superman
when she comes back to Earth. You know, we,

592
00:54:06,174 --> 00:54:11,136
having seen Justice League Warworld, we know
that that's where he is, up in space, but someone

593
00:54:11,176 --> 00:54:15,258
coming new to this film wouldn't know that,
and so it would just add to the confusion.

594
00:54:15,618 --> 00:54:20,520
Things like Commandy, you know, if people hadn't
seen that DC showcase short, they'd be like,

595
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:25,342
who the hell is this guy showing up randomly
in this film? Lots of little things like that.

596
00:54:25,783 --> 00:54:30,705
The investment required of the audience, I think,
is too much. And this trilogy so far has done

597
00:54:30,765 --> 00:54:37,005
absolutely zero handholding. Yeah, and it doesn't
help that a lot of the references, even in

598
00:54:37,186 --> 00:54:43,391
part one, are to some of my least favorite Tomorrowverse
films. Like, there's a lot of references to

599
00:54:43,431 --> 00:54:49,837
Justice Society World War Two. Hated that movie.
Legion of Superheroes. That movie sucked. It's

600
00:54:49,877 --> 00:54:54,461
like, where's the long Halloween references,
you know? Where's the... I guess they did have

601
00:54:54,581 --> 00:55:00,706
Green Lantern beware my power references, because
I liked that movie. But yeah. I mean, at least

602
00:55:00,726 --> 00:55:06,309
you could say the crisis films are better than
most of the other tomorrow verse films. I don't

603
00:55:06,329 --> 00:55:10,771
know how much that's saying, but it's saying
something. They're like midway there. They're

604
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:16,875
kind of mid overall. I like the first one again.
Yeah. Hopefully part three is going to be the

605
00:55:16,915 --> 00:55:22,758
best in the whole tomorrow verse universe in
the same way that Justice League Dark was really,

606
00:55:22,918 --> 00:55:28,201
really damn good and among the best of the DC
animated movie universe. But in regards to

607
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:33,639
this film, Despite intriguing backstories for
several characters, the film fails to capture

608
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:40,180
the stakes or interest of part one as it slowly
ramps up for the finale. We gave part one three

609
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:45,722
and a half stars. I'm giving this one a notch
below that three stars, right on the borderline

610
00:55:45,782 --> 00:55:52,064
of rotten and fresh. This time I'm leaning rotten
for rotten tomatoes. Right because you know

611
00:55:52,144 --> 00:55:55,905
the tomato meter is a measure of recommendation.
A lot of people view the tomato meter as a

612
00:55:55,945 --> 00:56:00,442
measure of quality. It's actually a measure
of recommendation. And at the end of the day,

613
00:56:00,703 --> 00:56:05,605
I think I would also not recommend this movie,
whereas I would recommend the first one. But

614
00:56:05,625 --> 00:56:09,787
that does it for this review. If you guys saw
the movie, I'd love to hear what you thought

622
00:56:46,301 --> 00:56:52,244
in lead up to our review of the Netflix series,
Dead Boy Detectives, we are doing a Sandman

623
00:56:52,364 --> 00:56:57,606
tie-in duel because Dead Boy Detectives takes
place in the Sandman universe. we will be pitting

624
00:56:57,806 --> 00:57:04,150
Sandman Wesley Dodds against Madame Webb. Right,
the Julia Carpenter version of Madame Webb,

625
00:57:04,230 --> 00:57:08,772
not the Cassandra Webb version, because she
would be, I think, pretty useless in a fight.

626
00:57:09,192 --> 00:57:13,475
She'd be able to tell how the fight went by
predicting her own defeat, but she wouldn't

627
00:57:13,495 --> 00:57:17,577
be able to do much more than that, you know?
Yeah. But no, I think it'll be a good matchup.

628
00:57:17,657 --> 00:57:23,480
You know, both Wesley Dodds and Julia Carpenter
can subdue their opponents and have premonitions

629
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:27,070
and stuff like that. I think it'll be pretty
good. But that does it for this episode, we

630
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:31,872
want to give a big thanks to our executive producers

634
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:53,100

pants.
