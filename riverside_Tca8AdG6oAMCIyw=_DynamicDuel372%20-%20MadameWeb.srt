00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,957
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,362 --> 00:00:29,746
Welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,786 --> 00:00:35,751
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:42,276
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous
Joe. And I have no idea why I'm leading this

5
00:00:42,317 --> 00:00:47,681
episode. It's like an all Marvel episode. Not
only are we reviewing Madame Webb later on,

6
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:52,705
it was alright, it wasn't terrible, but we're
also breaking down the news from this past

7
00:00:52,765 --> 00:00:58,491
week. which includes the release dates for Thunderbolts
and Fantastic Four being swapped and the trailer

8
00:00:58,531 --> 00:01:04,333
for the X-Men 97 cartoon that's coming out on
Disney+. This is my favorite kind of episode,

9
00:01:04,573 --> 00:01:09,494
is the all Marvel episode. Like why am I even
here? I ask myself that question every single

10
00:01:09,534 --> 00:01:14,455
time we record together. Honestly, who needs
a Marvel vs. DC podcast when you could just

11
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:20,057
have a Marvel podcast? Ugh, this sounds not
very fun at all. Just like Madame Web and the

12
00:01:20,097 --> 00:01:25,412
movies that Marvel makes. You mean Sony? No,
Marvel. Eh, Marvel has to take credit for it,

13
00:01:25,452 --> 00:01:29,776
too. Their name's in the front of it. As always,
guys, we list our segment times in our episode

anime characters. This week, we'll find out
who would win between Roronoa Zoro from One

36
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:30,772
Piece and Ezra Scarlett from Fairy Tail. As
always, I'm sure you nailed that pronunciation.

37
00:03:31,072 --> 00:03:36,455
Probably not. On the Console Combat podcast,
hosts John and Dean find out who would win

38
00:03:36,475 --> 00:03:41,454
in fights between popular video game characters.
In yesterday's episode. We found out who'd

39
00:03:41,494 --> 00:03:49,259
win between Halo's Master Chief and God of War's
Kratos. Visit dynamicpodcasts.com or click

00:03:55,123 --> 00:04:01,347
But with that out of the way, quick to the No
Prize! A No Prize is an award Marvel used to

42
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:06,871
give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel
No Prize, is a digital award we post on Instagram

43
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:11,678
for the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week's question

44
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:16,943
we asked, what has been your favorite Deadpool
joke out of all of Deadpool media? And that

45
00:04:16,963 --> 00:04:22,007
was coming off of the Deadpool and Wolverine
trailer that we got during the Super Bowl.

46
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:26,250
We got four answers, so we'll break down this
week's honorable mentions before revealing

47
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:33,196
the no prize winner. Our first honorable mention
goes to Clayton DeMato, who said, Hey there

48
00:04:33,216 --> 00:04:40,121
guys, my name is Clayton DeMato, long time listener.
As someone who enjoys to have his balls fondled.

49
00:04:40,482 --> 00:04:47,326
probably go where Deadpool talks about fondling
Wolverine's balls. But ultimately, I think

50
00:04:47,446 --> 00:04:54,171
the best is when Deadpool is fighting the mercenaries
in the car and he sticks the lighter in the

51
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:59,795
guy's throat and tells him not to swallow. Yes,
this was one of many off-color jokes made in

52
00:04:59,835 --> 00:05:05,960
the first Deadpool movie, for which I saw way
too many kids in theaters. I'm sure half the

53
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,262
jokes went over their heads, but still people
got to- Look at what the rating is before they

54
00:05:10,282 --> 00:05:19,107
take their kids to see a superhero movie. OK,
dad. Yeah, I am one. The don't swallow joke.

55
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:24,830
It's solid. It's quick. It's witty. It has a
perfect mix of being both adult and crude,

56
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:28,872
but also clever, which is one of the great things
I think about the Deadpool movies and Ryan

57
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:33,755
Reynolds style of humor is that it technically
is juvenile, but it's not necessarily childish,

58
00:05:33,795 --> 00:05:38,938
if that makes sense. Great answer, Clayton.
Our next honorable mention goes to Cornelius

59
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:45,921
Robinson who said, Hey guys, this is Cornelius
Robinson and my favorite joke from the Deadpool

60
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:51,683
media is through the movies. When he mentioned
that Nickassan and Teenage Warhead and Clauses

61
00:05:52,003 --> 00:05:58,186
were in a big house living together all alone.
And it was funny how it was almost the studio

62
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:06,549
didn't have any more money for new X-Men members.
Which was a meta joke and was returned in the

63
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:12,044
sequel. and it cracked me up. Yeah, that was
a little bit of self-deprecating humor on behalf

64
00:06:12,084 --> 00:06:17,367
of the studio. Great joke with Deadpool referencing
how only Negasonic Teenage Warhead and Colossus

65
00:06:17,387 --> 00:06:21,750
seem to be at the X-Men Mansion all the time.
I really did love the follow-up in Deadpool

66
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:27,513
2 when we saw the cast of X-Men Dark Phoenix
in one of the classrooms, like basically hiding

67
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:33,156
from Deadpool. So good. It did make me wonder
where in the timeline the second Deadpool movie

68
00:06:33,256 --> 00:06:37,987
fit, but yeah, it was a great gag. It was a
meta joke, it doesn't necessarily have to be

69
00:06:38,027 --> 00:06:42,771
scrutinized in the larger continuity. Sure,
sure, I get that. But great answer Cornelius,

70
00:06:42,851 --> 00:06:48,555
our final honorable mention goes to Travis Herndon,
who said, Hey guys, Travis here. So my favorite

71
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:54,320
joke would have to be from the Deadpool 2 teaser
where he's changing into his superhero costume.

72
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:00,324
Mostly just from the realism from it, like we
all think we'd be these badass superheroes

73
00:07:00,364 --> 00:07:04,511
and stuff though, but let's be honest with me.
would take that long just to get into our superhero

74
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:10,274
costume and possibly get the same outcome like
in the teaser. So that's my favorite joke just

75
00:07:10,314 --> 00:07:15,558
from the realism for me as well as just the
Superman theme too. Yeah, I'm not sure how

76
00:07:15,578 --> 00:07:20,741
many people remember the teaser trailer to Deadpool
2. It was played in front of the Logan movie.

77
00:07:20,981 --> 00:07:25,327
It was essentially... Wade Wilson walking down
and seeing an old man getting mugged in an

78
00:07:25,407 --> 00:07:30,090
alley and he runs into a phone booth to change
into his Deadpool costume and it just takes

79
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,972
entirely way too long. That's the joke. It takes
him like two minutes just to change into his

80
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:38,215
Deadpool costume and in the meantime before
he can even get out of the phone booth we hear

81
00:07:38,675 --> 00:07:45,019
the old man get shot. Great gag. A hilarious
way to kick off the marketing for Deadpool

82
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:49,858
2. I had almost completely forgot about this
teaser until Travis brought it up again. And

83
00:07:49,898 --> 00:07:55,920
now you just remember Ryan Reynolds ass. Thanks
for that. The Stan Lee cameo in that teaser

84
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,282
was pretty good, too, where he's like, hey,
nice suit. And he's like, zip it, Stanley.

85
00:08:01,122 --> 00:08:07,005
R.A.P. Great answer, Travis. But the winner
of this week's no prize is Sean Curtis. Who

86
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:14,508
said, hey, guys, Sean Curtis, I have to say
my favorite Deadpool joke of all time off the

87
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:19,394
top of my head anyway, would be from Ultimate
Spider-Man when Spider-Man is trying to warn

88
00:08:19,574 --> 00:08:27,459
Deadpool of Taskmaster's booby traps and Deadpool
goes, ha ha, traps. Because I'm expecting him

89
00:08:27,499 --> 00:08:34,464
to say, to be laughing at boobies, but it's
simple and catches me off guard. Yeah, and

90
00:08:34,524 --> 00:08:40,968
another classic Deadpool style joke where again
it mixes the juvenile with the clever. In the

91
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:46,043
Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon, Spider-Man... and
Deadpool teamed up against Taskmaster. And

92
00:08:46,304 --> 00:08:50,607
it was a nice bit of subversion where you think
that Deadpool, upon hearing the phrase booby

93
00:08:50,627 --> 00:08:54,971
traps is going to laugh at booby. But of course,
he laughs at traps. He's like, you said traps.

94
00:08:55,311 --> 00:08:58,854
It was a great gag. I never saw the ultimate
Spider-Man cartoon. I didn't even know Deadpool

95
00:08:58,894 --> 00:09:04,939
was in that. He seems like a risky character
for a cartoon. But, yeah, solid joke. Well,

96
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,943
the nice thing about Deadpool is that you can
make him as PG or rated R as you want to. And

97
00:09:09,003 --> 00:09:13,106
it just kind of works. As long as he's quirky
and funny, it'll still feel like him. Do you

98
00:09:13,126 --> 00:09:18,547
have a favorite Deadpool joke? I really like
the dig at DC that he did in Deadpool 2 where

99
00:09:18,567 --> 00:09:23,628
he's like, so dark, are you sure you're not
from the DC universe? That was quality. This

100
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:30,430
is fucking worst joke. No, but like I would
say mine is in sort of the same scene. He's

101
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,712
introduced to Black Tom Cassidy and he was like,
hi, white Wade Wilson. And then later on he

102
00:09:35,732 --> 00:09:43,054
was just like, you killed Black Tom Cassidy.
You racist. I was cracking up. Yeah. I also

103
00:09:43,094 --> 00:09:48,136
really liked the Juggernaut song though. Like
that one stick with me for a while. Holy shit

104
00:09:48,156 --> 00:09:55,359
balls. Yeah, that was great. Yeah, Deadpool's
humor is actually really solid and it makes

105
00:09:55,379 --> 00:09:59,641
me really excited to see Deadpool and Wolverine
coming out the summer. So congrats again to

106
00:09:59,661 --> 00:10:02,722
Sean Curtis for winning this week's No Prize.
If you the listener want a shot at winning

107
00:10:02,742 --> 00:10:07,224
your own No Prize, stay tuned to later on this
episode when we'll be asking another Question

108
00:10:07,264 --> 00:10:10,645
of the Week. And now that that's done, on to
the news.

109
00:10:16,226 --> 00:10:22,792
Alright, this past Valentine's Day we got official
word from Marvel Studios finally that Pedro

110
00:10:22,832 --> 00:10:28,357
Pascal will be playing Mr. Fantastic, Vanessa
Kirby will be Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn will

111
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:33,441
be Johnny Storm, and Iban Mas Bakrak, I'm still
not sure if I'm pronouncing that correctly,

112
00:10:33,662 --> 00:10:39,547
but he'll be Ben Grimm. Now we talked about
this news last week, before it was officially

113
00:10:39,587 --> 00:10:44,290
confirmed, but all but confirmed. It's nice
to finally- get that news from the studio itself.

114
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:48,792
It's shaping up to be a great cast. Really can't
wait to see them as Marvel's first family.

115
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:54,574
And out of all the cast that the Fantastic Four
franchise has had so far in live action, this

116
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:58,496
one actually seems the most interesting to me.
Yeah, it is interesting. I think it's a great

117
00:10:58,516 --> 00:11:04,118
cast. The logo is what I found most interesting.
Like it almost makes me wonder if the Fantastic

118
00:11:04,138 --> 00:11:09,160
Four is gonna be a period piece. I've heard
rumors that was gonna be the case. And I think

119
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:15,880
that this mid-century logo proves that. I think
they're really gonna set up the Fantastic Four

120
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:22,344
as like Marvel's first superhero family chronologically
within the Marvel Universe and have them like

121
00:11:22,424 --> 00:11:27,588
maybe time travel into the present day by the
end of the film. And why not? I mean, that

122
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:32,791
could work. It worked with Captain Marvel. So.
Right. Yeah, exactly. But besides the cast

123
00:11:32,831 --> 00:11:38,315
and potentially the setting of the movie, we
also got a release date change for the film.

124
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:44,194
It was originally going to kick off the summer
season in 2025. coming out May 2nd, but Fantastic

125
00:11:44,214 --> 00:11:49,096
Four has been pushed back to July 25th, which
is the date when the Thunderbolts movie was

126
00:11:49,116 --> 00:11:54,198
going to come out, but that film has been moved
up to May 2nd, so basically they just swapped

127
00:11:54,258 --> 00:11:59,701
dates. So now Thunderbolts is kicking off the
summer movie season, which I think is good

128
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:04,863
news. I think it shows that Marvel has faith
in the Thunderbolts movie to have such a valuable

129
00:12:04,903 --> 00:12:11,225
release date. Have they started filming Thunderbolts?
Not yet, no. Man, that seems like a quick turnaround.

130
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:17,047
But I imagine it has fewer special effects than
Fantastic Four would need. Maybe. Who knows?

131
00:12:17,587 --> 00:12:22,249
A few months prior to that, in February, we're
going to get Captain America, Brave New World,

132
00:12:22,369 --> 00:12:26,110
which has already started filming and I think
is close to wrapping up here. I think this

133
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:30,171
is all great news. It gives the studio more
time to work on Fantastic Four, which, you

134
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:35,112
know, is a flagship franchise that needs to
be done right in its third iteration. And nothing

135
00:12:35,132 --> 00:12:39,922
got pushed back. It's just dates that are swapping.
So we can still expect. something Marvel to

136
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:44,924
come out on those original dates. Yeah, next
year. Again, I'm really just hoping for this

137
00:12:44,964 --> 00:12:49,126
year to fly by. I know it's gonna be a crazy
year with like the election and everything.

138
00:12:49,586 --> 00:12:54,828
Just bring on 2025 after The Joker, of course,
cause I really want to see that, but yeah,

139
00:12:54,908 --> 00:13:00,430
2025 is gonna be better than 2024, I'm pretty
sure. Now I don't want to skip over Deadpool

140
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:04,212
and Wolverine. So we could get to that movie
and then once it comes out, then yeah, I'm

141
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:08,253
ready for 2025 already. All right, we'll just
skip to Deadpool and Wolverine, then skip to

142
00:13:08,273 --> 00:13:12,906
The Joker. and then skip to 2025. No, skip to
Christmas, because you can't skip Christmas,

143
00:13:12,946 --> 00:13:16,130
man. That's true. That's fair. What are we talking
about? I don't know.

144
00:13:19,414 --> 00:13:24,600
But let's go to move on to the next bit of news
here, which is that the official trailer for

145
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:30,302
the X-Men 97 cartoon has been released. It was
released under a new banner. called Marvel

146
00:13:30,362 --> 00:13:34,363
Animation, which is pretty exciting to see,
because I think it signifies that Marvel is

147
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:39,065
going to be producing a lot more animated projects.
Yeah, maybe What If will fall under that banner

148
00:13:39,105 --> 00:13:43,707
now, that's Spider-Man series, the prequel series
that they're coming up with. I forget the name

149
00:13:43,747 --> 00:13:48,449
of it. Yeah, that was originally called Spider-Man
Freshman Year, but they've since changed the

150
00:13:48,489 --> 00:13:52,811
title to Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. I'm
surprised there's not a home in there somewhere,

151
00:13:53,551 --> 00:13:58,273
but that's probably Marvel Animation, I imagine,
as well. Marvel Zombies is also going to be

152
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:03,657
animated. when that comes out. So, lots of projects
for Marvel Animation cannot wait. These type

153
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:08,940
of stories do really well, I think, in animation
and Marvel hasn't really invested too much

154
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,163
in that lately. Their previous animated films
weren't very good, but these series hopefully

155
00:14:13,203 --> 00:14:18,227
will be. Just like the X-Men cartoon was back
in the 90s, the trailer starts off showing

156
00:14:18,327 --> 00:14:22,310
us clips from the series from Nali back when
that ended and picks up right where it left

157
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:27,193
off. It's cool that the camera goes into the
analog screen and basically takes us right

158
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:33,639
back into that world. The animation is a little
bit different in style, but you can tell heavily

159
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:38,921
inspired by the 90s cartoon at the very least,
especially in terms of character design, especially

160
00:14:38,941 --> 00:14:43,422
in terms of voice. Yeah, it sounds like the
voice cast is returning, which I think I had

161
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:47,903
already known that, but it was a nice kind of
surprise to hear as well. Yeah, if it's not

162
00:14:47,923 --> 00:14:54,245
the original voice cast, they are remarkable
impressionists. It's nice to see Cyclops as

163
00:14:54,285 --> 00:14:58,447
the leader of the team again. and really take
center stage. Hopefully he proves to a whole

164
00:14:58,467 --> 00:15:03,191
new generation of fans that he is the de facto
leader of the X-Men because the movies kind

165
00:15:03,231 --> 00:15:07,535
of gave him the shaft. The most standout moment
for me in the trailer is when Wolverine is

166
00:15:07,595 --> 00:15:13,559
charging toward the camera, Gambit jumps on
his back and charges his claws up with kinetic

167
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,122
energy. I thought that was really dope. Yeah,
it was a nice combo move, kind of like a fastball

168
00:15:17,162 --> 00:15:22,174
special, you know, if Colossus isn't around
or anything like that. Yeah. I like there was

169
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:27,598
a scene with Storm and she has her new haircut.
It's like the ponytail kind of thing and there's

170
00:15:27,618 --> 00:15:31,501
just lightning crackling all around her. I'm
like, oh shit, the animation is a lot better

171
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:37,125
than in the 90s. Yeah, the ponytail hair here
is kind of like a nice compromise between,

172
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:41,869
you know, her long flowing hair from the 90s
cartoon and also her mohawk style. I really

173
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:47,773
like the way it looks here. Yeah, same. We see
Jean Grey in this trailer who appears to be

174
00:15:47,873 --> 00:15:52,575
pregnant. Which is a surprise because that never
happened in the comic books. Scott knocked

175
00:15:52,635 --> 00:15:59,218
up Madeline Pryor, who was a clone of Jean Grey.
So either this version of Jean Grey is actually

176
00:15:59,238 --> 00:16:04,500
a clone or they're just going to make Jean Grey
the mother of Cable, which is what I assume

177
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:10,943
they're going with here. I think that's Cable
in the womb. Unless Wolverine's the father.

178
00:16:11,163 --> 00:16:17,298
Oh, shit scandals. I doubt that they would do
that. But if they're making Jean Grey. Cable's

179
00:16:17,338 --> 00:16:22,080
mother. I'm totally fine with that because she
basically raised him in the comic books anyway

180
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:27,723
when she and Scott were sent to the future to
take care of him. I don't really like the character

181
00:16:27,743 --> 00:16:32,786
of Madeline Pryor or like the Goblin Queen or
any of that stuff. So I won't miss her if she's

182
00:16:32,806 --> 00:16:37,529
gone. It looks like Magneto has taken over the
whole school, which is kind of cool. Yeah,

183
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:42,771
that is from the comics. Magneto took over the
school around the time of the New Mutants and

184
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:46,593
he kind of turned over a new leaf for a while
before, you know, going back to being the villain.

185
00:16:47,226 --> 00:16:52,788
The trailer got me pumped up with loads of nostalgia.
I remember loving this series as a kid, especially

186
00:16:52,828 --> 00:16:57,250
the first two seasons. The show kind of fell
off after that. But the show was always known

187
00:16:57,290 --> 00:17:02,892
for seriously tackling the issues of prejudice
and things like that. And hopefully this new

188
00:17:02,932 --> 00:17:06,473
cartoon really runs with those themes, keeps
it as straight as possible, doesn't make it

189
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:10,215
too goofy or anything like that because that's
what made the original 90s X-Men cartoon so

190
00:17:10,235 --> 00:17:14,617
great. I can't wait for it. The show is actually
going to debut pretty soon here in about a

191
00:17:14,737 --> 00:17:21,374
month on March 20th. on Disney Plus. And speaking
of the 90 series, that brings us to our question

192
00:17:21,414 --> 00:17:21,816
of the week.

193
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:32,453
What was your favorite character from the X-Men
90s cartoon, besides Wolverine, and why? I

194
00:17:32,473 --> 00:17:36,975
mean, everyone's gonna say Wolverine, so yeah,
that's probably a good caveat. Record your

200
00:18:07,118 --> 00:18:10,583
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and get into

201
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:16,633
our main event, where we review the latest Sony
Spider-Man Universe movie, Madam Web.

202
00:18:33,522 --> 00:18:40,567
directed by S.J. Clarkson and stars Dakota Johnson,
Sidney Sweeney, Isabella Merced, Celeste O'Connor,

203
00:18:40,747 --> 00:18:46,771
and Tahar Rahim. The movie is based on an obscure
Spider-Man ally from the comic books, a mysterious

204
00:18:46,871 --> 00:18:51,675
psychic woman who can peer into the web of life
and destiny, and has helped Spidey in several

205
00:18:51,735 --> 00:18:58,480
of his adventures. Madam Web is a project that
literally no one asked for, centered around

206
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,331
a character that isn't even bottom of the barrel.
She's so under and below the barrel that you

207
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:09,555
have to dig to find her. I wasn't anticipating
this film, I only moderately enjoyed it and

208
00:19:09,615 --> 00:19:14,859
I won't be recommending it. I don't think a
lot of people are going to be seeing this movie,

209
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:21,283
I don't think it's necessary to see. So as I
give our obligatory spoiler warning for this

210
00:19:21,323 --> 00:19:26,547
review, I do so with great ambivalence. If you
don't want to be spoiled on Madame Webb's plot,

211
00:19:27,107 --> 00:19:33,183
give us a pause and I wish you the best in seeing
this movie. If it sounds like I'm actively

212
00:19:33,223 --> 00:19:37,746
discouraging people from seeing the film, you
may be partially correct. It's gotten to the

213
00:19:37,786 --> 00:19:43,770
point now where the obviousness of Sony's disregard
for the source material and the audience is

214
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:49,094
beyond the pale. For those who may not know,
prior to the existence of Marvel Studios, the

215
00:19:49,134 --> 00:19:53,857
film rights for many Marvel characters were
sold to outside studios with Spider-Man going

216
00:19:53,877 --> 00:19:59,341
to Sony. It made sense at the time because Marvel
was a publishing company. They made comics.

217
00:19:59,381 --> 00:20:04,164
They didn't know how to make movies. But since
the mid-2000s, Sony has cranked out a lot of

218
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:09,148
subpar live action films, especially when compared
to Marvel Studios, who has obviously had the

219
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:14,292
best handle on their own intellectual property.
Spider-Man has fared much better at Marvel

220
00:20:14,372 --> 00:20:18,976
than he ever did at Sony, but technically the
Spider-Man Home Trilogy films were a Marvel

221
00:20:19,016 --> 00:20:24,981
production of a Sony franchise, because to this
day, Sony still has the rights to Spider-Man,

222
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:28,984
and they will continue to have them as long
as they keep making Spider-Man-related films

223
00:20:29,064 --> 00:20:34,618
and don't lapse on their contract. The only
reason average films like The Amazing Spider-Man,

224
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:40,240
Venom, Morbius, and now Madame Web were made
was to keep the character from reverting to

225
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:45,621
Marvel. In Sony's eyes, it's better to make
a mediocre movie now that no one wants to see

226
00:20:45,821 --> 00:20:51,743
in order to retain the potential of making money
later. And as a Marvel fan, and as a movie

227
00:20:51,763 --> 00:20:57,605
fan, that sucks. And if we have to show the
studio that message with our wallets, then

228
00:20:57,625 --> 00:21:03,259
that's what we should probably do. Don't go
through any great efforts to see this movie

229
00:21:03,379 --> 00:21:08,403
if you already weren't planning on doing so.
Yeah, it's definitely not worth your time,

230
00:21:08,504 --> 00:21:13,267
I would say. Yeah, I mean, it's not terrible,
but you're right, yeah. It's not worth probably

231
00:21:13,287 --> 00:21:17,151
the money that you would spend. I would probably
say if you're gonna see it, wait until it's

232
00:21:17,191 --> 00:21:22,195
out of theaters on streaming. That being said,
I'm not gonna bash this movie for the sake

233
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:28,060
of it. I will remain as impartial as I can as
a critic. There are some people out there saying

234
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,110
that this is the worst superhero movie ever
made. But I think they're forgetting that 2015's

235
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:38,033
Fantastic Four exists. Or Batman and Robin,
which was worse than that. Or the Shaquille

236
00:21:38,053 --> 00:21:42,654
O'Neal Steel movie, which was worse than that.
So, Madame Webbe, I would say, is around the

237
00:21:42,694 --> 00:21:48,797
same quality as Morbius, although I personally
liked Morbius a little bit more. Madame Webbe

238
00:21:48,957 --> 00:21:52,959
is a film that is more divisive than outright
horrible. And I'll say that I liked it a little

239
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:57,881
bit more than I thought I would. But in the
end, I could take it or leave it. Again, it's

240
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:03,323
a film no one asked for. Yeah, I mean... I also
liked it surprisingly a little bit more than

241
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:07,426
I thought I would because I was expecting the
worst movie that's ever been made honestly

242
00:22:07,446 --> 00:22:12,170
with the way film critics were talking about
it. But I honestly liked it more than Morbius.

243
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:16,853
I'd say I liked it more than Electra. There
are worse Marvel movies than this in my opinion.

244
00:22:17,393 --> 00:22:24,698
Yeah, go see Howard the Duck, right? Exactly.
Yeah. But yeah, I mean, it's really hard to

245
00:22:24,738 --> 00:22:30,786
watch non MCU Marvel movies, because it's obvious
that they don't have a roadmap. You know, how

246
00:22:30,826 --> 00:22:36,969
does this connect in any way to Morbius or the
upcoming Craven film or Venom? I have no idea.

247
00:22:37,069 --> 00:22:42,351
I honestly don't care. Yeah, I really don't
care where this whole thing is going. And I

248
00:22:42,391 --> 00:22:46,372
kind of get the impression that the filmmakers
didn't really care about this project at all

249
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:51,394
either. And even the writers, it seems like
none of them had really read the comics. Well,

250
00:22:51,414 --> 00:22:55,036
I mean, it's not like there's a huge amount
of Maddenweb comics to go off of. You know,

251
00:22:55,056 --> 00:23:00,347
this is largely an original origin story for
the character. Yeah, to be honest, I don't

252
00:23:00,367 --> 00:23:04,491
know much about the character. All I know from
her is what I learned from the animated series

253
00:23:04,531 --> 00:23:09,997
in the 90s. Yeah, that was also my introduction
to the character. She had quite a sizable role

254
00:23:10,017 --> 00:23:14,502
within that animated series, much larger than
she ever did in the comic books. Interesting.

255
00:23:15,223 --> 00:23:20,508
The movie isn't a total dumpster fire. I think
what keeps the film from being so is the director,

256
00:23:20,769 --> 00:23:26,068
S.J. Clarkson. This lady has been a part of
every single television show you've ever loved

257
00:23:26,348 --> 00:23:32,532
in the last 15 or so years, having directed
quintessential episodes of Heroes, House, Dexter,

258
00:23:32,692 --> 00:23:38,135
Bates Motel, Orange is the New Black, Jessica
Jones, Game of Thrones, Succession, Need I

259
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:44,278
Go On. You know, SJ Clarkson is incredibly acclaimed
and talented. And I also think that she set

260
00:23:44,318 --> 00:23:48,220
up some incredible shots in this movie, especially
in the first act when Cassie is discovering

261
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:53,628
her powers. It's clear. that the director had
an incredible knack for visual storytelling.

262
00:23:54,048 --> 00:24:01,093
The problem is that the story has to be good,
and Madame Webb's story is not good. A lot

263
00:24:01,113 --> 00:24:06,136
of the characters are shallow, the second act
is a drag with very little momentum, and I

264
00:24:06,156 --> 00:24:10,660
don't care how good of a director you are, there's
no way to direct most of the dialogue in this

265
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,303
film. Some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard
in any film. And what's really tragic is that

266
00:24:16,444 --> 00:24:22,748
S.J. Clarkson actually has a screenplay credit
here. So it's not clear where things went wrong,

267
00:24:23,088 --> 00:24:28,093
but given the director's track record, I can
almost guarantee it was studio interference.

268
00:24:28,213 --> 00:24:33,077
Interesting. I didn't realize she wrote this
as well. That's a shame if it was studio interference

269
00:24:33,117 --> 00:24:37,240
because they really threw her under the bus
letting her put her name all over it. Yeah,

270
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:42,385
it seems to me when it comes to Sony and the
Sony Spider-Man Universe films, it's like a

271
00:24:42,445 --> 00:24:47,569
bunch of non-creative business people making
creative decisions that muddle the overall

272
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:53,921
vision. Cause I do think that there were flashes
of a genuine suspense thriller here, but I

273
00:24:53,961 --> 00:24:58,885
guarantee you that some executive was like,
no, we need a scene of these girls dancing

274
00:24:58,925 --> 00:25:04,208
on the table. And like we need the climactic
fight to be under that Pepsi sign and like

275
00:25:04,328 --> 00:25:10,172
put in fireworks. Cause my niece loves fireworks.
So much Pepsi product placement. It was a little

276
00:25:10,192 --> 00:25:13,755
ridiculous. Really made me want a Pepsi though
at the end of this film, but hell no, I'm a

277
00:25:13,815 --> 00:25:19,643
Coke guy for life. Honestly, the movie that
I, probably would have preferred to this one

278
00:25:19,843 --> 00:25:24,967
is the superhero movie that we were promised
in the marketing. Like was this even a superhero

279
00:25:24,987 --> 00:25:29,451
movie? Maybe in the sense that there were people
with powers and a struggle between good and

280
00:25:29,491 --> 00:25:34,235
evil, but the costumes were pretty much non-existent.
It wasn't like this, it was a spider-woman

281
00:25:34,275 --> 00:25:39,359
team-up film where we got to see these ladies
kick ass. Right? Yeah, I don't even know like

282
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:44,023
how the girls got their spider powers. Like
what the hell? Yeah, the characters were like

283
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:48,618
pretty much a bait-and-switch I think, which
was not cool. The film felt so small because

284
00:25:48,658 --> 00:25:53,861
the stakes were so minuscule. While the film
implies that these teenage girls will grow

285
00:25:53,961 --> 00:25:58,603
up to become superheroes, doesn't show anything
to the effect of them, you know, saving the

286
00:25:58,643 --> 00:26:04,086
world in the future or even stopping a crime
or doing anything worthwhile besides striking

287
00:26:04,106 --> 00:26:08,788
some cool poses. I mean, technically they all
kind of saved Peter Parker's life, but it's

288
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:14,091
not even clear in this universe whether or not.
Peter Parker will become Spider-Man. If he

289
00:26:14,151 --> 00:26:19,115
does, he's not a very original character considering
there's a shit ton of other Spider-People in

290
00:26:19,155 --> 00:26:23,879
this universe. And that's one of the worst things
about this movie, right? The implications that

291
00:26:23,899 --> 00:26:29,384
it has on the larger Sony Spider-Man universe
where everybody gets Spider-powers. You get

292
00:26:29,424 --> 00:26:33,788
Spider-powers. You get Spider-powers. There's
a whole race of indigenous Spider-People in

293
00:26:33,828 --> 00:26:38,712
Peru apparently. And you know... There is some
of that in the comics. There's the whole spider

294
00:26:38,752 --> 00:26:43,256
society, which I think was one of the worst
ideas ever. Like J. Michael Straczynski really

295
00:26:43,296 --> 00:26:49,041
started this all when he insinuated that Spider-Man
was part of the spider totem and that all of

296
00:26:49,081 --> 00:26:54,145
his animal themed bad guys were also representatives
of their animal totems. It's kind of a neat

297
00:26:54,225 --> 00:27:00,831
idea and concept, but people ran with that shit
for years and years. And then it just outstated

298
00:27:00,851 --> 00:27:05,426
its welcome. Like you had the sisterhood of
the wasps. and the Spider Society and all this

299
00:27:05,547 --> 00:27:11,750
random shit. And it got really lame really fast.
I'm just gonna say it now. There's too many

300
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:17,774
Spider-Men, like way too many. I agree with
you, for sure. At least within the 616 proper

301
00:27:17,854 --> 00:27:22,296
universe, I don't care how many Spider-Men there
are across the multiverse. And I think that

302
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:26,279
actually works, especially when you look at
a film across the Spider-Verse. But when you

303
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:31,041
have 50 million Spider-Men and Spider-Women
in the same playground, it gets a little crowded.

304
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:36,072
Which is a shame, I feel like, for anyone who
liked the Spider-Verse films. Like if they

305
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:40,774
go into this movie expecting like more of that
kind of awesomeness, they're going to be sorely

306
00:27:40,814 --> 00:27:46,797
disappointed. Oh, for the most part. I really
wish that this movie, like those Spider-Verse

307
00:27:46,837 --> 00:27:51,899
films, was made for the fans. Because honestly,
I don't think this one was. I think this was

308
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:58,766
trying to capture a new demographic for superhero
films that really isn't. as interested in them

309
00:27:58,986 --> 00:28:05,450
as comic book readers. I 100% agree. It was
like it was trying to tap into like the teenage

310
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:09,572
thriller genre, like the people that went and
saw Final Destination. But I think they'll

311
00:28:09,592 --> 00:28:13,975
be disappointed when they see this film. Of
course, the fans will be disappointed. So it's

312
00:28:13,995 --> 00:28:18,897
hard to know exactly who is going to love this
movie, if anybody. But speaking of the characters,

313
00:28:18,917 --> 00:28:24,801
let's go ahead and get into our character breakdown,
starting with Madame Webb, aka Cassandra Webb,

314
00:28:24,841 --> 00:28:30,183
who was played by Dakota Johnson. I actually
liked Dakota Johnson here more than I wanted

315
00:28:30,223 --> 00:28:34,904
to. I haven't seen her in too much stuff, only
in Suspiria, but I was never too impressed

316
00:28:34,924 --> 00:28:39,765
with her acting ability. In this movie though,
I actually thought she did well enough with

317
00:28:40,005 --> 00:28:45,707
most of the material, not just in conveying
her burgeoning psychic powers, but also her

318
00:28:45,787 --> 00:28:50,288
emotional scenes as well. Yeah, this was also
the first time I saw her. I agree, I didn't

319
00:28:50,308 --> 00:28:53,929
think she did that terrible. She probably had
the best performance in the film next to like

320
00:28:54,009 --> 00:28:59,388
Adam Scott. Yeah. She has this kind of deadpan
style to her that I think was really able to

321
00:28:59,468 --> 00:29:04,712
tap into the script's humor. I think she sold
the comedy actually really well. What little

322
00:29:04,752 --> 00:29:11,257
comedy there was in the script. And surprisingly,
I believed in the idea of her as a superhero

323
00:29:11,377 --> 00:29:16,021
toward the end of the movie more than I believed
in her as a cynical paramedic in the beginning

324
00:29:16,041 --> 00:29:20,964
of the film. I wouldn't mind seeing more of
her as a superhero character if and when she

325
00:29:20,984 --> 00:29:26,996
turns up again down the line. I praise her performance,
however, with the caveat that she completely

326
00:29:27,036 --> 00:29:31,358
dropped the ball in her final scene with the
wheelchair and the strange eyeglasses. That

327
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:36,661
was just a really bad delivery. Absolutely.
I'm still really confused by that whole thing.

328
00:29:37,121 --> 00:29:42,344
Like obviously she was blinded by some kind
of debris, but when did she become paralyzed?

329
00:29:42,725 --> 00:29:48,908
How did she afford this like badass wheelchair?
And why was she like all smiley at the end?

330
00:29:48,948 --> 00:29:53,283
Like the future has been really good, I guess.
I don't know. I remember reading a quote from

331
00:29:53,363 --> 00:29:57,307
James Marsden over 20 years ago when he was
doing an interview for the first X-Men movie

332
00:29:57,367 --> 00:30:02,171
saying that it was really hard to act through
his cyclops visor and I think maybe Dakota

333
00:30:02,191 --> 00:30:06,375
Johnson just had the same struggles here. Yeah,
it's gotta be a challenge. And it's a shame

334
00:30:06,415 --> 00:30:11,060
that Final Seem was what the audience was left
with because I think the rest of her performance

335
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:15,454
was pretty decent. Good even. Especially as
she goes through her arc, you know, Cassie

336
00:30:15,494 --> 00:30:20,776
starts the film as a cynical paramedic detached
from others due to her life as a seemingly

337
00:30:20,916 --> 00:30:25,937
unloved foster child. I think she resented her
mother for being more invested in her research

338
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:31,398
in the Amazon and then dying instead of caring
and being there for her. And what's actually

339
00:30:31,418 --> 00:30:36,060
great about this aspect of the movie is that
I thought the same thing about her mom. Like,

340
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:41,121
I remember thinking in the beginning, like,
lady, you are pregnant, do not fight over the

341
00:30:41,161 --> 00:30:47,783
spider with the gun toting psycho. But in Cassie
getting her powers and exploring their ties

342
00:30:47,803 --> 00:30:52,764
to her mother's past, she learns that her mom
did care about her, that her whole reason for

343
00:30:52,804 --> 00:30:57,466
seeking out the spider was for the improved
quality of life for her child. And I don't

344
00:30:57,486 --> 00:31:01,907
know if it's because I'm a parent now, but that
revelation hit me like a punch in the gut.

345
00:31:02,367 --> 00:31:06,769
And Cassie carried that forward, protecting
and then seemingly raising these neglected

346
00:31:06,809 --> 00:31:12,522
teens as the mother figure herself, coming full
circle. Cassie's arc and that theme of motherhood

347
00:31:12,723 --> 00:31:17,985
is the best part of this movie without a doubt.
Yeah, that was a nice revelation. The fact

348
00:31:18,025 --> 00:31:22,627
that she learned that, you know, what her mom
was doing was for her. It was a selfless act.

349
00:31:23,127 --> 00:31:25,989
You're right that she should have just given
up the spider though. Like she shouldn't have

350
00:31:26,049 --> 00:31:30,070
put up that much of a fight. It's like things
will be okay. Yeah. What's interesting is that

351
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:37,446
the disease that the doctor told Cassie's mom
that her baby would have is what- character

352
00:31:37,466 --> 00:31:43,251
of Madame Webb actually has in the comic books.
It's called Myasthenia Gravis, and in the books,

353
00:31:43,411 --> 00:31:48,896
Madame Webb was born with it. She was born blind
and a paraplegic, and she developed these psychic

354
00:31:48,936 --> 00:31:54,020
powers, this ability to peer into the web of
life and destiny, which is a construct of fate.

355
00:31:54,701 --> 00:31:59,185
And in this movie, that is the disease that
Cassie's mom was trying to prevent. Yeah, so

356
00:31:59,205 --> 00:32:04,589
you could say it's ironic then that her daughter
ended up blind and in a wheelchair anyway at

357
00:32:04,609 --> 00:32:09,636
the end. Yeah, like it was faded or something.
The web of life and destiny is actually the

358
00:32:09,716 --> 00:32:13,658
source of Spider-Man's Spidey-Sense and all
the Spider characters who have Spidey-Sense

359
00:32:13,678 --> 00:32:18,241
are able to tap into that just a little bit.
In the comics, Madame Web worked as a psychic

360
00:32:18,341 --> 00:32:23,704
medium who was once visited by Peter Parker,
whom she knew off the bat was Spider-Man, surprising

361
00:32:23,764 --> 00:32:28,586
him, and she would go on to help him in several
of his adventures. She not only had telepathy,

362
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:34,009
but she also had clairvoyance. She could predict
the future and she could also astral project.

363
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:38,231
This movie had an interesting take on the astral
projection though, in that she could send out

364
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:42,852
multiple copies of herself who could also interact
physically with the environment. That was a

365
00:32:42,872 --> 00:32:46,793
little weird. Yeah, pretty unique though. I
thought that was actually kind of cool. Yeah,

366
00:32:46,813 --> 00:32:51,034
it's an interesting way to not limit her so
much if the character is ever used again in

367
00:32:51,114 --> 00:32:56,516
future films. Let's go ahead and move on to
Julia Cornwall who is played by Sydney Sweeney.

368
00:32:56,916 --> 00:33:01,337
This is actually my first time seeing Sydney
Sweeney in anything. I never watched Euphoria

369
00:33:01,597 --> 00:33:07,063
or White Lotus or anything. I only really know
of Sydney Sweeney by her reputation as a smoke

370
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:13,266
show, but I'll say that I walked away disappointed
by her acting. Like is she overrated or was

371
00:33:13,386 --> 00:33:18,348
this just not the right project for her? It
was almost like the insecurities of her character

372
00:33:18,568 --> 00:33:23,831
leaked into her performance, making her come
across as more of an awkward actress than an

373
00:33:23,911 --> 00:33:29,953
awkward teenager. I've never seen her in anything
either, but I don't think she did terrible.

374
00:33:30,173 --> 00:33:35,827
I- I think she played an insecure teenager fairly
well. Stop thinking with your dick. She was

375
00:33:35,927 --> 00:33:42,069
not great in this movie. I don't think I am.
Honestly, I think she did the best out of the

376
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:47,950
three teenage actresses or playing teenagers.
I think Isabella Merced did the best. And that's

377
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,831
good news for you considering that she's going
to be Hawke Girl in next year's Superman legacy

378
00:33:51,851 --> 00:33:56,813
movie. But let's talk about Anya Corazon played
by Isabella Merced. None of the characters

379
00:33:56,833 --> 00:34:01,666
were written well. Again, the dialogue was so
incredibly awful. But at least I think Anya

380
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:07,951
had the most believable delivery. Sydney Sweeney
had to play this shy teenager, which she totally

381
00:34:07,971 --> 00:34:12,574
didn't come across as. Celeste O'Connor, who
played Maddie Franklin, tried to portray herself

382
00:34:12,654 --> 00:34:17,377
as this rebellious teen, which I also didn't
think she sold. But Isabella Merced as Anya

383
00:34:17,497 --> 00:34:23,381
really just had to play smart. She was the smart
one. She had the easiest acting job, and therefore

384
00:34:23,421 --> 00:34:28,564
I think she pulled it off better. Yeah, I mean,
she did fine. I don't know if I agree that

385
00:34:28,585 --> 00:34:32,448
she did better than the Sidney Sweeney, but
yeah, she definitely did better than Celeste

386
00:34:32,468 --> 00:34:37,272
O'Connor. Yeah, Celeste O'Connor played Maddie
Franklin. This is my first time seeing Celeste

387
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:41,656
in anything, and if I never see her again in
another film, I think I would be just fine.

388
00:34:42,077 --> 00:34:48,242
Her acting was so bad in this movie. She brought
down the entire film like she didn't deliver

389
00:34:48,322 --> 00:34:52,838
a single line, believably, I thought, and it
was probably one of the. worst performances

390
00:34:52,878 --> 00:34:57,782
out of any superhero movie in the last few decades.
But not only that, like her character sucked.

391
00:34:57,943 --> 00:35:04,388
Like Maddie was so unlikable and rude and impulsive.
And when she tried rescuing Cassie while skateboarding

392
00:35:04,548 --> 00:35:10,073
on a piece of debris, I wanted to fucking puke.
If we gave away Brothers Awards for the worst

393
00:35:10,113 --> 00:35:13,976
moment, that would win it, because that was
just ridiculous. What did you think about her

394
00:35:14,036 --> 00:35:18,380
backstory? Are I guess any of these three girls
backstories? I thought they were good backstories.

395
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:23,342
I agree. I thought. that made the characters
more interesting. What I'm really curious about

396
00:35:23,462 --> 00:35:27,944
is how they got their powers in the movie. Yeah,
they never address that. They just leave it

397
00:35:28,124 --> 00:35:31,705
open-ended, I assume, for maybe a sequel, where
they'll get their powers or something like

398
00:35:31,725 --> 00:35:36,366
that. But in the comics, Cassie just kind of
developed her powers. She's not a mutant, but

399
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:42,168
she just became a psychic, I think, largely
because her condition left her with a clairvoyant

400
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:48,129
mind. But Julia Cornwall, who would later become
Julia Carpenter, she got her powers through

401
00:35:48,169 --> 00:35:53,579
genetic experiments. by a secret government
group called the Commission and they gave her

402
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,021
like, you know, the standard power set. But
what's unique about her is that she has psychic

403
00:35:57,061 --> 00:36:01,463
webbing. It's like psychic energy that lets
her restrain her opponents and she can also

404
00:36:01,543 --> 00:36:05,464
send out psychic feelers as like the spider
sense. And we saw that in the movie. That was

405
00:36:05,484 --> 00:36:09,626
kind of cool. Yeah. I mean, it wasn't clear
that it was psychic webbing, but that's what

406
00:36:09,646 --> 00:36:14,748
it was. Maddie Franklin, she's called Spider-Woman
in the comics. She gained her powers through

407
00:36:14,768 --> 00:36:21,551
this It didn't give her spider abilities, but
it did give her strength, speed, agility, reflexes.

408
00:36:22,051 --> 00:36:27,934
But she later got the additional abilities of
Madame Webb's granddaughter, who had been turned

409
00:36:27,974 --> 00:36:33,476
into a spider-human hybrid by Doctor Octopus,
hence the giant spider legs from her back that

410
00:36:33,516 --> 00:36:39,339
allow her to wall crawl. And then Anya, who
is known as Aranya in the books, or Spider

411
00:36:39,379 --> 00:36:44,901
Girl sometimes, her powers were given to her
by a sorcerer of the Secret Spider Society

412
00:36:44,961 --> 00:36:49,944
who was trying to save her life. and she did
get the powers of a spider in addition to the

413
00:36:49,984 --> 00:36:55,429
ability to summon this exoskeleton armor. And
she also carries these spider bola devices

414
00:36:55,549 --> 00:37:00,873
that she created that allow her to grapple ledges
and snare opponents and can also be thrown

415
00:37:00,913 --> 00:37:05,577
as projectiles. So we saw that in the movie
too. Man, that's a lot to get through in a

416
00:37:05,637 --> 00:37:10,922
sequel if they ever do. Yeah, I assume that
if they ever get to those superhero origins,

417
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:15,145
they'll probably all get their powers in the
same way. Yeah, from the spiders in Peru, I

418
00:37:15,185 --> 00:37:21,139
guess. Speaking of that, let's move on to Ezekiel
Sims who is played by Tahar Rahim. I don't

419
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:27,641
even know where to start. Tahar Rahim is an
actor I've never heard of playing horribly

420
00:37:28,241 --> 00:37:33,862
a role that is unrecognizable compared to the
comic book Ezekiel, a character who in itself

421
00:37:33,942 --> 00:37:39,644
is a big ol' sack of mediocrity. Never ever
have I cared less about a comic book movie

422
00:37:39,684 --> 00:37:46,614
villain. He had no arc beyond his desire to
just continue existing. Beyond that, there

423
00:37:46,634 --> 00:37:51,458
were no goals. You know, he's a guy who wanted
the spider venom to give himself power. And

424
00:37:51,498 --> 00:37:56,743
I guess he did that. You know, he amassed this
power and wealth, but like, who the fuck is

425
00:37:56,763 --> 00:38:02,188
this guy? Like, why did he want power? What
did he plan on doing with it? What was he doing

426
00:38:02,268 --> 00:38:06,912
all this time as Cassie was growing up? Like
fucking investing in stocks and jacking off

427
00:38:06,932 --> 00:38:12,217
or some shit? He was not a good villain. He
was barely even a character. You know, he mentioned

428
00:38:12,297 --> 00:38:18,493
something in. the Amazon about his family starving
or something like that. And I guess he built

429
00:38:18,513 --> 00:38:23,436
an empire after that. But I have no sense of
how loaded this guy is. Apparently only has

430
00:38:23,456 --> 00:38:28,600
like one employee who works in his apartment.
It's like they couldn't find another location

431
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,663
for him. They couldn't like show him walking
through office space or anything like that.

432
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:38,046
It's like, holy crap, what is going on here?
Like he wasn't evil enough. He wasn't interesting

433
00:38:38,086 --> 00:38:43,398
enough. He wasn't anything worthwhile enough.
And also his acting was not great. Not only

434
00:38:43,418 --> 00:38:47,841
did I not believe any of Tahar Rahim's line
deliveries, I don't even think he delivered

435
00:38:47,881 --> 00:38:52,704
them because his voice never matched his mouth.
It was like most of his lines were 80 yard

436
00:38:52,724 --> 00:38:58,589
in post-production. Yes. I actually wondered
if that was his actual voice in the movie or

437
00:38:58,629 --> 00:39:02,652
if they got another actor to do his lines because
I don't know, maybe he had a really heavy accent

438
00:39:02,672 --> 00:39:06,975
that was difficult to understand. I could definitely
see in a lot of the shadowy scenes and just

439
00:39:07,035 --> 00:39:12,830
in the poor editing that he wasn't really actually
saying. the lines we are hearing. Yeah, that

440
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:17,052
may be due to rewrites, might be due to an accent
or something. He's a French actor, and maybe

441
00:39:17,092 --> 00:39:20,994
he couldn't pull off a convincing Latin American
accent, which I think the character was supposed

442
00:39:21,014 --> 00:39:28,697
to be. Yeah, who knows? But in the books, Ezekiel
is not Peruvian, although he did get his powers

443
00:39:28,737 --> 00:39:33,859
through a mystic ritual in a Peruvian spider
temple, which is probably why the movie started

444
00:39:33,959 --> 00:39:41,334
off in Peru. But like Ezekiel never wore a black
Spider-Man suit in the comics. Where did that

445
00:39:41,354 --> 00:39:45,855
come from? Like, I want to know the reasoning
behind that. The film never addresses why he

446
00:39:45,895 --> 00:39:49,996
looks like Spider-Man. It makes no sense, especially
when you consider the implications for Spider-Man

447
00:39:50,196 --> 00:39:55,778
and his costume, which he developed and created
and conceived of all on his own. It implies

448
00:39:55,838 --> 00:40:02,620
that maybe there was some external influence
in Peter Parker's costume creation, and that

449
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,081
doesn't make sense. Maybe from the Peruvian
spider people? Not sure. Oh, that was dumb

450
00:40:08,121 --> 00:40:13,386
too. It was interesting. I kind of feel like
when they were trying to explain the character

451
00:40:13,426 --> 00:40:17,688
of Ezekiel, they're like, he's kind of like
Spider-Man. So they're like, oh, so he wears

452
00:40:17,728 --> 00:40:22,209
a suit. Let's just make him look like evil Spider-Man.
Ugh. Yeah, that was some studio executives

453
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:25,930
idea for sure. They're like, we got to make
it marketable. We got to make it seem like

454
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:31,171
Spider-Man's in this movie. 100%. The final
characters I want to talk about are Benjamin

455
00:40:31,211 --> 00:40:37,313
Parker, played by Adam Scott, and Mary Parker,
played by Emma Roberts. I don't have too much

456
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:42,183
to say about them because their roles were so
small. They're both likable actors who I think

457
00:40:42,223 --> 00:40:46,225
were entirely wasted in their roles in this
movie. I don't know about wasted. I think they

458
00:40:46,305 --> 00:40:51,048
almost kind of added credibility to the film
that it would have normally had. I liked seeing

459
00:40:51,088 --> 00:40:55,750
them in those roles. I think they're bigger
actors than, you know, what those roles called

460
00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:00,673
for. They could have gotten away with actors
of a lesser caliber, but no, I like seeing

461
00:41:00,693 --> 00:41:04,776
them in the roles. Yeah, it makes you wonder
if they're planning to use them again down

462
00:41:04,816 --> 00:41:09,580
the line, which is why they wanted to get these
bigger name actors. I keep making allusions

463
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:13,363
to a sequel to this movie, but I think it's
pretty clear that that's not going to happen.

464
00:41:13,883 --> 00:41:18,467
If Madame Web ever shows up again, it's probably
going to be in some kind of like team up film,

465
00:41:18,547 --> 00:41:21,830
like Sinister Six type movie or something like
that, that I think Sony is working toward,

466
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:27,594
but probably not a Madame Web too. Just taking
the box office into consideration. Yeah, I

467
00:41:27,614 --> 00:41:32,925
didn't even get number one. And this is a Spider-Man
movie. That's crazy. Yeah, but that does it

468
00:41:32,945 --> 00:41:35,973
for all the characters. Let's go ahead and move
into our story highlights.

469
00:41:43,082 --> 00:41:49,747
In 1973, medical researcher Constance Webb discovers
a rare species of spider in the Peruvian jungle

470
00:41:49,827 --> 00:41:55,532
whose venom has healing and strengthening properties.
Though she is pregnant, her security escort

471
00:41:55,632 --> 00:42:01,638
Ezekiel Sims shoots her and steals the spider.
An indigenous tribe tries to save Constance's

472
00:42:01,678 --> 00:42:06,502
life using the spider venom, but she dies shortly
after giving birth to her daughter Cassandra.

473
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:11,734
Now writing out that scene kind of sounds pretty
interesting and cool in theory. But seeing

474
00:42:11,814 --> 00:42:17,015
it done in practice, I thought was kind of ridiculous,
especially when you see the indigenous tribe

475
00:42:17,055 --> 00:42:22,857
crawling through the trees looking like Spider-Man.
It's like, what the fuck is going on here?

476
00:42:24,137 --> 00:42:30,259
The CG is pretty bad seeing them leap through
the trees. But I honestly didn't hate the designs

477
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:35,240
of them. Like, if you're going to do an indigenous
Amazon tribe, Spider-Man, that's how you do

478
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,082
it. I didn't like the black webbing that they
covered their bodies in. It was like. black

479
00:42:40,122 --> 00:42:44,286
twigs or something. Yeah, or netting, something
like that. Some kind of- It was like trying

480
00:42:44,326 --> 00:42:49,772
too hard to make it look like Spider-Man's costume.
Probably, probably that's fair. I thought it

481
00:42:49,792 --> 00:42:53,075
was just kind of an interesting design at the
very least. Now when they were talking about

482
00:42:53,115 --> 00:42:58,281
the legend of the Aranya people, I forget what
they called them, they mentioned a poison touch

483
00:42:58,401 --> 00:43:03,666
that Ezekiel Sims, of course, later on gets.
What did you think of that? I think that's

484
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:08,489
a cool idea, Ezekiel does not have that power
in the comics, but I think it was a way to

485
00:43:08,529 --> 00:43:12,753
make him seem more villainous and more threatening.
Back to the story, 30 years later, in 2003

486
00:43:13,393 --> 00:43:20,258
Queens, New York, Cassie works as a paramedic
alongside her partner Ben Parker. After helping

487
00:43:20,318 --> 00:43:24,602
rescue a man from a car about to fall off a
bridge, she falls into the water and has a

488
00:43:24,662 --> 00:43:29,645
near-death experience that awakens her psychic
potential to see into the web of life and destiny.

489
00:43:30,146 --> 00:43:33,828
I thought that was a pretty cool scene when
she first started seeing the web in the water.

490
00:43:34,388 --> 00:43:39,031
It was hella confusing, honestly. I did like
how the shattered glass looked like a web.

491
00:43:39,111 --> 00:43:43,954
Actually there's a ton of shattered glass in
this movie that's very web-like. It's kind

492
00:43:43,974 --> 00:43:48,496
of like a recurring visual motif. Yeah, I thought
that was pretty neat. Especially when it also

493
00:43:48,556 --> 00:43:54,380
correlates to what feels like her mind fracturing
as her powers start developing. Right, yeah

494
00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:02,361
exactly. I do have a question. Were Cassandra
and Ben fucking? No. OK. He stuck in the tip

495
00:44:02,501 --> 00:44:09,687
once. It didn't count. He put in a ball. All
I know is that didn't really mean anything.

496
00:44:09,727 --> 00:44:14,371
Ben tells her that, like, you know, he's met
someone, but he never says may. I was just

497
00:44:14,431 --> 00:44:18,715
wondering because they had like a weird chemistry
between each other. No, I think she was too

498
00:44:18,755 --> 00:44:23,859
detached for any sort of relationship. Oh, Cassie
began suffering from visions that turn out

499
00:44:23,879 --> 00:44:28,658
to come true, such as the death of her coworker,
O'Neil. Meanwhile, it's revealed that since

500
00:44:28,678 --> 00:44:33,861
his time in Peru, Ezekiel used the spider venom
to grant himself enhanced physicality, wall

501
00:44:33,881 --> 00:44:40,584
crawling ability, a poisonous touch, and precognitive
dreams. Ezekiel seduces and kills an NSA agent

502
00:44:40,624 --> 00:44:45,126
to get access to a person tracking system to
find three girls that his visions have convinced

503
00:44:45,166 --> 00:44:51,108
him will kill him in the future. I do think
you can't really say precognitive dreams considering

504
00:44:51,128 --> 00:44:56,358
the fact that his dreams were lying to him.
Yeah, it's hard to say because, you know, according

505
00:44:56,398 --> 00:45:01,520
to this movie, the future can be changed. So,
I'm wondering if that's what would have happened

506
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:08,042
to him if Madame Webb never came to be or something.
Who knows? I have no idea what happened there.

507
00:45:08,102 --> 00:45:12,943
Yeah, kind of dumb. Meanwhile, Cassie has a
vision on the subway of Ezekiel murdering the

508
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:18,225
three girls, Julia Cornwall, Maddie Franklin,
and Anya Corazon. She convinces the girls to

509
00:45:18,245 --> 00:45:23,327
get off the train and they flee. Ezekiel pursues
them. but his attention is diverted long enough

510
00:45:23,347 --> 00:45:28,552
by local police trying to stop him for Cassie
and the girls to escape in a taxi. Cassie drives

511
00:45:28,572 --> 00:45:33,497
them to a nearby forest where they discuss the
man who moves like a spider. Cassie tells them

512
00:45:33,517 --> 00:45:38,362
to wait there as she leaves to revisit her mother's
spider research back home. I thought it was

513
00:45:38,382 --> 00:45:43,835
a little convenient how easily they were able
to ditch Ezekiel. Really, he was too distracted

514
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:49,419
by taking out police officers. Why not just
wait for them to be away from the police considering

515
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:53,663
no one was looking up at the ceiling apparently
to see him? Well, the police were shooting

516
00:45:53,703 --> 00:45:58,287
at him. He had to take him out. They would have
kept shooting at him as he was trying to get

517
00:45:58,307 --> 00:46:02,811
at the girls. But they were only shooting at
him because he started attacking them, right?

518
00:46:03,271 --> 00:46:07,515
Well, and also because he's a fucking dude crawling
on the ceiling. I think, you know, anybody

519
00:46:07,535 --> 00:46:14,043
would shoot at that. That's where I would. Back
in the forest, the girls get restless and walk

520
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:19,367
to a nearby diner. Cassie learns from her mother's
journal about the rare Peruvian spider, the

521
00:46:19,407 --> 00:46:25,251
mysterious indigenous tribe, and Ezekiel's identity
as her mother's former security escort. At

522
00:46:25,271 --> 00:46:29,834
the diner, the girls draw attention to themselves,
prompting a local to report the location of

523
00:46:29,854 --> 00:46:35,458
their missing whereabouts, leading to Ezekiel
finding them. Cassie gets visions of Ezekiel

524
00:46:35,518 --> 00:46:40,021
killing them in the diner, prompting her to
crash her car into the restaurant to ram him.

525
00:46:40,462 --> 00:46:44,463
Teenage girls, man, you can't leave them alone
for a second before they're dancing on a tabletop

526
00:46:44,483 --> 00:46:48,965
so impress some boys. I don't know what kind
of kid you're raising, but she needs to shape

527
00:46:49,045 --> 00:46:56,368
up. I was just saying, it was like bad writing.
Like really bad. It was. Cassie hides the girls

528
00:46:56,428 --> 00:47:00,910
at a hotel where she learns more about Ezekiel's
motives and abilities after communicating with

529
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:05,812
him through a dream. She teaches the girls how
to perform CPR, then leaves them to hide out

530
00:47:05,872 --> 00:47:11,499
at Ben's while she travels to Peru. There Cassie
discovers a member of the indigenous tribe

531
00:47:11,519 --> 00:47:16,221
who tells her how her mother died and guides
her through the web of life and destiny revealing

532
00:47:16,261 --> 00:47:21,944
that her pregnant mom sought out the spider
in Peru to cure her daughter's myasthenia gravis.

533
00:47:22,384 --> 00:47:26,246
I do wonder why the guy wasn't dressed up like
rainforest spider-man anymore. He was like

534
00:47:26,266 --> 00:47:32,308
wearing regular clothes. Like, does the tribe
sometimes paint themselves red and cover themselves

535
00:47:32,328 --> 00:47:36,690
in black twigs and then sometimes wear regular
clothes? Or I had something happen to that

536
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:40,452
guy in the last 30 years where he was like,
you know what? I'm going to move out of the

537
00:47:40,492 --> 00:47:45,214
rainforest. Yeah, I wondered the same thing.
I think that was a mistake. I think they should

538
00:47:45,234 --> 00:47:49,676
have kept with the tribal look. Yeah, I agree,
because, you know, they felt very mysterious

539
00:47:49,956 --> 00:47:56,059
and mystical almost. Back in Queens, Ben's sister-in-law,
Mary, goes into labor on the way to the hospital.

540
00:47:56,099 --> 00:48:01,622
Ben's car is caught on camera with the girls
and Ezekiel pursues them. Cassie. Now back

541
00:48:01,662 --> 00:48:05,844
in New York has a vision of them being attacked
and steals an ambulance to help the girls escape

542
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:11,626
and divert Ezekiel away from Ben and Mary. She
takes the girls to a condemned fireworks factory

543
00:48:11,787 --> 00:48:16,569
where they set up traps for Ezekiel and call
for a helicopter medical evac. Now I'm pretty

544
00:48:16,609 --> 00:48:22,352
sure that freaking fireworks factory burned
down earlier in the movie, right? Right? Yeah,

545
00:48:22,392 --> 00:48:26,133
like how are all those fireworks still there
after a fire like that? That doesn't make any

546
00:48:26,193 --> 00:48:30,687
sense. Also, I didn't realize that bottle rockets
could shoot holes through brick walls. I got

547
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:35,729
to be more careful with those things. I know,
right? Those fireworks were so ridiculously

548
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:41,452
overpowered. I think it was a front for like
a mafia artillery cache or something like that,

549
00:48:41,532 --> 00:48:46,594
because like literally one of those fireworks
took down a whole fucking helicopter, like

550
00:48:46,794 --> 00:48:52,997
exploded it. It's so crazy. And like ripping
holes through the roof and like it pretty much

551
00:48:53,037 --> 00:48:56,847
toppled the whole building down. It's like,
where can I buy these fireworks? Not where

552
00:48:56,887 --> 00:49:02,092
we live. You and I have had some fireworks mishaps
on our own, you know, like accidentally having

553
00:49:02,112 --> 00:49:06,455
them explode the cardboard tube that they're
in and like sending sparks everywhere. But

554
00:49:06,495 --> 00:49:10,378
I don't remember that being powerful enough
to like rip a hole in someone's house. It's

555
00:49:10,418 --> 00:49:16,523
sad guys are on fire, but didn't destroy a house.
When Ezekiel arrives, the fireworks distract

556
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:21,447
him as the girls make their way to the roof
for the evac. Ezekiel follows and the helicopter

557
00:49:21,468 --> 00:49:26,263
gets destroyed, putting each of the girls in
danger. Cassie's powers then fully manifest,

558
00:49:26,343 --> 00:49:31,347
allowing her to project astral projections to
help each of the girls. As the building falls

559
00:49:31,387 --> 00:49:35,991
apart, Cassie reveals that it was she and not
the girls who were destined to destroy Ezekiel,

560
00:49:36,191 --> 00:49:41,015
and he falls to his death before being crushed
by a falling Pepsi sign. There are so many

561
00:49:41,075 --> 00:49:46,800
times in this movie where I'm like, does Ezekiel
not have spider sense? Like, how the hell is

562
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:51,767
he getting hit by all these different things?
Like- ambulances and fireworks and signs. I

563
00:49:51,847 --> 00:49:57,429
think that maybe his spidey sense kind of manifests
as those dreams, visions that he gets. Sucks

564
00:49:57,449 --> 00:50:02,772
to be him then. Yeah. Cassie also falls off
the building into the river below where she's

565
00:50:02,812 --> 00:50:09,895
blinded by a firework. She's saved from drowning
by Julia and Maddie and Anya perform CPR. Cassie

566
00:50:09,935 --> 00:50:15,677
awakens in a hospital, now paralyzed and blind,
and learns that Mary gave birth to her son,

567
00:50:15,877 --> 00:50:21,028
Peter. Back at her apartment in a wheelchair,
Cassie decides to mentor the girls in their

568
00:50:21,048 --> 00:50:26,831
future roles as Spider-Heroes and has a vision
of them in costume. No, they never named the

569
00:50:26,851 --> 00:50:33,615
baby Peter. No, and you know, fans will obviously
get the reference. I don't know if general

570
00:50:33,675 --> 00:50:38,738
audiences will know that that's actually Spider-Man
and Uncle Ben and Spider-Man's mom. Yeah, no

571
00:50:38,778 --> 00:50:42,820
one in my family did. I saw it with my wife
and daughters and I had to explain to them

572
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:47,078
who those characters were and why they were
important. Seems like they dropped the ball

573
00:50:47,418 --> 00:50:52,782
on that front. Yeah. You know, considering that
at the baby shower, they played a game where

574
00:50:52,802 --> 00:50:56,964
they tried to guess the baby's first name. They
could have at least followed through with that

575
00:50:57,144 --> 00:51:02,867
by having a scene where Cassie visits Mary and
is like, so what did that name end up being?

576
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:07,610
And she's like, Peter, you know, and then the
audience is like, Oh my God. You know, that

577
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:11,712
would have been better. Right. And the baby
would have been played by Toby McGuire. Right.

578
00:51:11,792 --> 00:51:16,039
Exactly. I didn't see this would have flipped
out. Yeah, superimposed Toby McGuire's face

579
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:22,462
on little baby's head. The costumes we saw at
the end were not great. I feel like that was

580
00:51:22,502 --> 00:51:28,085
the best look we got at them. And I did not
love Madame Webbs. It looked really cheap.

581
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:33,768
I don't know if it was just like the lipstick
or the glasses or I don't know. Just I didn't

582
00:51:33,788 --> 00:51:39,163
like it. I don't like any of them as much as
I thought I would. I liked the costumes, I

583
00:51:39,203 --> 00:51:44,206
did not like the headgear on any of them. Especially
Madame Web's which looked like a plastic sleeping

584
00:51:44,346 --> 00:51:50,691
eye mask. Yes. The costume looked fine though.
I didn't like Julia Cornwall's mask. That was

585
00:51:50,731 --> 00:51:55,794
weird. Oh, like the chin strap? Yeah. Very strange.
But that was the end of the movie. There was

586
00:51:55,834 --> 00:52:00,097
no end credit scene or mid credit scene. I think
I was half expecting Jared Leto to show up

587
00:52:00,277 --> 00:52:05,781
and say it's morbentime or something like that.
But I'm kind of glad that there wasn't. Overall.

588
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:11,400
The movie did have some emotional moments and
was competently directed, but I think a beautiful

589
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:16,322
arc regarding motherhood can't save the film
from its clunky dialogue, the lack of superhero

590
00:52:16,402 --> 00:52:23,585
action, subpar performances, and forgettable
characters. I rate this film 2.5 stars out

591
00:52:23,605 --> 00:52:30,168
of 5, a rotten rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Yeah,
that sounds about right. I forget what we gave

592
00:52:30,268 --> 00:52:36,743
Morbius. We gave Morbius 3 stars? Yeesh. But
I actually think Morbius had a stronger story

593
00:52:36,923 --> 00:52:41,646
and a better villain. I actually think Madame
Web was about the same quality as the Echo

594
00:52:41,926 --> 00:52:45,888
television series that we just reviewed, which
we also gave two and a half stars. Yeah, maybe

595
00:52:45,908 --> 00:52:50,090
you're right when it comes down to the villain.
This absolutely was one of the worst villains

596
00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:56,894
in superhero cinema history, hands down. So
yeah, around 2.5 seems right to me. I'm not

597
00:52:56,934 --> 00:53:02,017
expecting much better in terms of quality for
the next Sony Spider-Man Universe film that's

598
00:53:02,037 --> 00:53:06,931
coming out later this year. which will be Craven
the Hunter. Yeah, no, the whole radioactive

599
00:53:06,991 --> 00:53:14,074
lion blood just still freaking kills me. These
Sony film writers need to read the comics.

600
00:53:14,674 --> 00:53:18,676
They would have made something we actually maybe
would have wanted to see, like a Miles Morales

601
00:53:18,716 --> 00:53:23,398
movie or like Prowler, I don't know, something
cool. I think a Prowler movie is a great idea.

602
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:28,340
Just make it starring Donald Glover. I'd definitely
see that. Oh, you weren't into Hypno Hustler?

603
00:53:28,981 --> 00:53:34,420
No, fuck that. But that does it for the review
