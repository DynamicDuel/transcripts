00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,963
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,174 --> 00:00:28,195
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:33,216
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based

4
00:00:33,276 --> 00:00:39,618
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother Johnny DC. And this episode

5
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:45,320
guys, it's a big one. It's a big milestone team
duel episode, which we do every 25 episodes

6
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:51,101
or so. We're going to find out who would win
in a fight between the outsiders and X-Force.

7
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:57,794
The Outsiders is a badass DC group started by
Batman consisting of characters like Black

8
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:03,599
Lightning and Katana, and X-Force is a badass
Marvel group consisting of characters like

9
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:09,364
Cable and Deadpool. Yeah, they're borderline
street level teams, but they also have some

10
00:01:09,424 --> 00:01:14,748
real powerhouses and some really cool characters.
Yeah, this particular team duel was determined

11
00:01:14,788 --> 00:01:19,891
by our executive producers and... We've been
building toward it for a few months now, and

12
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:24,454
I'm really excited to see who's going to win
between these two groups. Of course, this isn't

13
00:01:24,474 --> 00:01:28,216
the first team duel that we've done. We've done
lots of other team duels. I think we've done

14
00:01:28,236 --> 00:01:34,708
like 11 of them now, including... Justice League
vs Avengers Titans vs X-Men Justice Society

15
00:01:34,748 --> 00:01:40,652
vs Fantastic Four Suicide Squad vs Defenders
Justice League Dark vs The Midnight Suns Arkham

16
00:01:40,712 --> 00:01:47,117
Asylum vs Sinister Six Young Justice vs Young
Avengers The Flash's Rogues vs The Brotherhood

17
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:52,921
of Mutants Doom Patrol vs Guardians of the Galaxy
We did a special last Halloween, Deceased vs

18
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:58,324
Marvel Zombies and the Legion of Doom vs. Masters
of Evil. If any of those strike your fancy,

19
00:01:58,444 --> 00:02:02,686
definitely go check out our Team Duel episodes.
In addition to this episode, because, you know,

20
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:07,149
they're big ones. They're a lot of fun. A lot
of work goes into them. So much work. Yeah,

21
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:13,032
it's worth it, though. And we hope you guys
enjoy our four hundred and first episode. Episode

22
00:02:13,052 --> 00:02:17,682
400 was actually our Suicide Squad Isekai review.
But before we get into that team duel, we're

23
00:02:17,702 --> 00:02:20,903
going to go over the latest comic book movie
news to come out this past week, of which there

24
00:02:20,923 --> 00:02:26,104
was just one news item, and that was that Marvel
television executive, Brad Winterbaum, has

25
00:02:26,144 --> 00:02:31,526
confirmed that Nova will be a television series.
As always, we list our segment times in our

00:02:31,566 --> 00:02:35,307

out of the way, quick, to the no prize! A no

47
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,831
prize is an award Marvel used to give out to
fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel No Prize,

48
00:04:31,091 --> 00:04:35,793
is a digital award that we posted on Instagram
for the person that we feel gave the best answer

49
00:04:35,814 --> 00:04:41,777
to our question of the week. Last week we asked,
out of the 400 episodes we've done, what has

50
00:04:41,817 --> 00:04:46,820
been your favorite episode of Dynamic Duel so
far, and why? And I thought we would get a

51
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:53,323
ton of answers. We got three. Which is disappointing,
but you know, I think we've asked this question

52
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:57,402
a few times already, so it makes sense that
we would get diminishing returns on it. We

53
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:03,226
got two honorable mentions and a no prize winner.
Our first honorable mention goes to Miggy Mathengian,

54
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:08,150
who said, Hey, what's up, guys? This is Miggy.
And my favorite episode of your guys's is the

55
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:14,354
Titans versus X-Men team duel. It just came
out at a time when I had finished catching

56
00:05:14,374 --> 00:05:19,978
up on all of your backlog and I was listening
to episodes weekly. And the Titans are like

57
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:25,374
my favorite team and some of my favorite characters.
So it was just kind of that sweet spot. Also

58
00:05:25,454 --> 00:05:30,335
the Batman review with the Spies Brothers, the
Batman movie with the Spies Brothers, the 60s

59
00:05:30,435 --> 00:05:36,137
one, hilarious. Thanks guys. Yes, we have definitely
asked this question before and Mickey has responded

60
00:05:36,497 --> 00:05:40,898
with those same answers. But just hearing his
choices again reminds me of how much fun I

61
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:45,919
have doing this podcast. It makes me feel like
we peaked years ago on this show. Totally.

62
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:51,541
His answers have not changed. That's true. We
keep putting out new episodes, but apparently

63
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:57,822
they're not getting any better than those I
mean it is the Titans and X-Men. Well, maybe

64
00:05:57,842 --> 00:06:03,084
the X-Force episode will be better. We'll see.
Yeah, cause Outsiders is kind of Titans adjacent

65
00:06:03,384 --> 00:06:09,466
and X-Force is X-Men adjacent. We'll see. No
pressure, no pressure. Thanks, Miggy, for your

66
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:15,527
answer. Our next honorable mention goes to Travis
Herndon, who said. What's up, DynamaDews? Travis

67
00:06:15,547 --> 00:06:22,449
here, shout out to my other twins. So my answer
would have to be your video on Poison Ivy versus

68
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:27,913
Emma Frost's battle. That one to me was definitely
the funniest from you guys' back and forth.

69
00:06:27,933 --> 00:06:35,139
You know how the fight was slowly going from
this actual fight to this hot and steamy, sexy

70
00:06:35,719 --> 00:06:40,863
time and you guys had to be stopping yourselves
over and over again. So that had to be my pick,

71
00:06:40,963 --> 00:06:47,889
the Poison Ivy vs Emma Frost. Yeah, that's embarrassing.
Really the only quasi-sexy thing that I remember

72
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:54,298
from that duel is when Poison Ivy cracked Emma
Frost's diamond form. And Jonathan said that

73
00:06:54,338 --> 00:07:02,402
the crack was the crack of the ass. Ridiculous.
But yeah, Jonathan does that type of shit all

74
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:07,325
the time when it comes to the femme fatale duels
and he's working on it. He's trying to do better.

75
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:13,849
I literally cannot deny it because our patrons
have access to our blooper reels from when

76
00:07:13,869 --> 00:07:20,332
we did like Catwoman versus Hellcat. I'm not
proud of it, but I am amused by it. Great answer,

77
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:25,831
Travis. But the winner of this week's snow prize
is. Kat Stevenson who said, Hi guys, it's Kat

78
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:32,736
again. And recently I went to the Seattle Museum
of Pop Culture where I got to see the Batman

79
00:07:32,776 --> 00:07:37,759
and Robin suit. Seeing the Bat nipples in real
life made me realize that my favorite episode

80
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:46,966
is your Batman and Robin review. That movie
is absolutely bat shit crazy. And just getting

81
00:07:47,006 --> 00:07:51,949
to listen to you guys rant about a horrible
movie is amazing. I love that episode and I

82
00:07:51,989 --> 00:07:57,312
love you guys. Thank you so much. Thanks, Kat.
Yeah, this episode got the win largely because

83
00:07:57,372 --> 00:08:01,195
I was just really surprised by the answer. I've
never heard this before. Actually, I remember

84
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:06,098
when we did that review of Batman and Robin,
we got some flack from some listeners who just

85
00:08:06,258 --> 00:08:10,660
knew the movie was bad and didn't want to hear
a review on it. I guess not recognizing that,

86
00:08:11,081 --> 00:08:15,623
you know, we're trying to review all the Marvel
and DC movies whether they're new or old. Good

87
00:08:15,743 --> 00:08:22,123
or bad. Right. And holy cow, Batman and Robin.
is bad. Even revealing it, I'm like, this review

88
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:27,705
is way worse than I even remembered it being.
I'm glad someone liked the review because I

89
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:32,707
sure did not enjoy writing it. But the best
part about that whole experience was probably

90
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:38,469
recording our review and just cracking up. So
yeah, brought back some good memories. Thanks,

91
00:08:38,509 --> 00:08:42,431
Kat Stevenson. Congrats on winning this week's
No Prize. If you the listener want a shot at

92
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:46,673
winning your own No Prize, stay tuned to later
on this episode when we'll be asking another

93
00:08:46,973 --> 00:08:50,543
question of the week. And now that that's done.
On to the news!

94
00:08:55,938 --> 00:09:01,380
This past week, Brad Winterbaum, who is the
Marvel Studios Head of Streaming, Television,

95
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:08,523
and Animation, guested on a podcast called the
Phase Zero Podcast. And on the show, Winterbaum

96
00:09:08,603 --> 00:09:13,885
confirmed that Nova is getting a Disney Plus
television series. Now, I think a lot of us

97
00:09:13,985 --> 00:09:17,787
have assumed that for quite a while or we've
known that. But what was interesting about

98
00:09:17,827 --> 00:09:22,869
this reveal that Nova is going to be a television
show is that Brad Winterbaum described the

99
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:29,869
series as having shades of both Star Trek and
Battlestar Galactica, which both of those shows

100
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:36,175
are long running fan-loved sci-fi franchises.
So this can only mean good things for a Nova

101
00:09:36,235 --> 00:09:40,198
series. Actually, you know what? I thought the
most interesting thing about that was, of course,

102
00:09:40,258 --> 00:09:45,482
Marvel would be doing a Nova series after the
Green Lantern series was greenlit by Warner

103
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:50,666
Brothers. Because why wouldn't they? Because
they're a bunch of copiers. I'm sorry. The

104
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:56,286
Green Lantern series has been described as true
detective in space. whereas the Nova series

105
00:09:56,326 --> 00:10:01,489
is being described as Star Trek and Battlestar
Galactica. Now which one of those other television

106
00:10:01,509 --> 00:10:07,371
show comparisons seems more appropriate for
an intergalactic, spacefaring, peacekeeping

107
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:13,634
core out in the galaxy? You tell me. True Detective
or Star Trek? Now when you say appropriate,

108
00:10:13,694 --> 00:10:20,477
do you mean like interesting? Because True Detective!
I mean both. True Detective. Dude, Star Trek?

109
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:26,273
Meets Battlestar Galactica. It's a big done
before. It's called Star Trek and Battlestar

110
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:33,818
Galactica. True Detection has been done before.
But now what? I have space, bro. OK, come on.

111
00:10:33,838 --> 00:10:38,922
Oh, let's see Star Trek in space. I wonder what
that's like. Fucking awesome. That's what it's

112
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:45,226
like. Now, Brad Winterbaum said that it's going
to be an ensemble piece. So it looks like the

113
00:10:45,246 --> 00:10:49,869
series is not just going to focus on one Nova
like Richard Ryder or maybe Sam Alexander.

114
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:54,491
It's going to focus on the entire Nova Corps
and perhaps what happens to them after Zandar

115
00:10:54,511 --> 00:10:59,592
is destroyed. I would prefer the Nova Corps
and the Gromund Day to visit Earth, recruit

116
00:10:59,732 --> 00:11:04,654
Richard Ryder, and then restart the Nova Corps.
I think that'd be a great premise. But really

117
00:11:04,674 --> 00:11:10,735
the MCU is focusing more on the Nova Corps itself,
the entire team, as opposed to one individuel

118
00:11:11,055 --> 00:11:15,137
Corps member. We saw in the first Guardians
of the Galaxy film where we were introduced

119
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:20,090
to the Corps on Zandar, how the Nova Corps were
more like a... police force than a group of

120
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,453
superheroes, you know, they didn't fly around
on their own. They flew around in Nova Corps

121
00:11:24,493 --> 00:11:30,616
spaceships. And the way the Nova Force manifested
was like an energy force field linked between

122
00:11:30,636 --> 00:11:35,279
their ships and stuff like that. It was really
fascinating. And it'll be really interesting

123
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:40,282
to see where they take that concept with this
Nova Corps series, especially considering that

124
00:11:40,342 --> 00:11:44,544
Xandar has been destroyed. I'm actually not
surprised they're making it an ensemble considering

125
00:11:44,584 --> 00:11:49,483
some of the cast members they've had. in the
Nova Corps and past movies like John C. Reilly

126
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:53,704
and Glenn Close. You know, if you could get
those actors to come back, maybe even for like

127
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:58,246
a brief appearance, that'd be pretty cool. But
also, I'm not surprised that it's an ensemble

128
00:11:58,306 --> 00:12:05,249
because a lead character named Dick Ryder is
not for Disney+. You are the first person to

129
00:12:05,289 --> 00:12:11,712
ever make that joke. I mean, I try. Now, Richard
Ryder is a great character. If you guys want

130
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:16,502
to learn more about him, definitely check out
our duel episode between him and Hal Jordan

131
00:12:16,562 --> 00:12:22,684
Green Lantern. Actually, speaking of Green Lantern,
rumors are a swirling about who they are going

132
00:12:22,724 --> 00:12:29,026
to cast as Hal Jordan. The list includes Josh
Brolin, Thanos himself, Matthew McConaughey,

133
00:12:29,246 --> 00:12:35,428
Ewan McGregor, Chris Pine, and Timothy Olyphant.
And I gotta say, that's a solid lineup. I'd

134
00:12:35,448 --> 00:12:39,189
be happy with any one of those. Yeah, I'd be
happy with any of those except for Josh Brolin,

135
00:12:39,309 --> 00:12:42,651
I think. He just doesn't feel like Hal Jordan
to me. But it seems like they're going with

136
00:12:42,691 --> 00:12:48,198
an older actor for Hal Jordan and a younger
actor for Jon Stewart. Yeah, yeah, that's their

137
00:12:48,238 --> 00:12:52,904
plan, allegedly. But speaking of Nova and Green
Lantern, that brings us to our question of

138
00:12:52,924 --> 00:12:53,205
the week.

139
00:12:57,582 --> 00:13:03,766
Who would you cast as Richard Ryder in the Nova

145
00:13:35,278 --> 00:13:38,240
Well that does it for all the news for this
episode, so let's go ahead and get into our

146
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:44,364
main event where we find out who'd win in a
fight between DC's The Outsiders and Marvel's

147
00:13:44,885 --> 00:13:45,365
X-Force.

148
00:14:00,642 --> 00:14:06,065
Alright, Outsiders vs X-Force. These are two
badass teams that I think are largely well

149
00:14:06,105 --> 00:14:11,448
known for their respective fan bases. X-Force
is definitely well known even amongst non-comic

150
00:14:11,468 --> 00:14:18,312
book readers because the team made a cameo appearance
on the Deadpool 2 movie. Yeah, and the Outsiders

151
00:14:18,332 --> 00:14:24,295
had an entire season dedicated to them in the
Young Justice animated series from DC. Which

152
00:14:24,335 --> 00:14:30,062
is not the same level of popularity as a theatrical
release. Nobody watches this cartoon that you're

153
00:14:30,082 --> 00:14:35,264
talking about. The only people that would know
who the outsiders are actual DC comic book

154
00:14:35,304 --> 00:14:40,465
fans, I think. Bitch, you don't know people's
lives? Show me the numbers. Prove me wrong.

155
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:45,887
Prove yourself right. The burden on proof is
on you, I think. I'm just gonna say that it

156
00:14:45,947 --> 00:14:50,348
is. You have to prove me wrong. That's how it
works. We'll tell everybody out there who are

157
00:14:50,408 --> 00:14:56,091
not quite familiar with who the outsiders are
their basic gist. The idea of the outsiders

158
00:14:56,231 --> 00:15:01,976
is that they can do things and go places that
the Justice League cannot. And the X-Force

159
00:15:01,996 --> 00:15:07,020
are kind of exactly the same when it comes to
the X-Men. Like the X-Force go out and do things

160
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,484
outside of the scope of your standard X-Men
mission. You know, they're often considered

161
00:15:11,624 --> 00:15:17,309
outlaws for their more extreme, brutal methods.
You know, they're a product of the extreme

162
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:23,694
80s and 90s. They're also a product of the outsiders,
because the outsiders can first... and they

163
00:15:23,734 --> 00:15:28,796
did all that stuff first. How do you know that
the Outsiders came first? Because the X-Force

164
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:33,959
came out in like the early 90s, I'm pretty sure,
and the Outsiders were around before Crysis.

165
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,842
Well X-Force came out in 1991. Okay, yeah, so
I'm right. Again it doesn't matter who came

166
00:15:39,882 --> 00:15:44,045
out first, it matters who did it better. And
we're going to find out which team is better

167
00:15:44,105 --> 00:15:49,208
in this episode, but to explain the methodology
behind our team duels, let's go to our sentient

168
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:55,423
duel simulator Alfred Jarvis 9000. Tell our
listeners how you go about determining a winner

169
00:15:55,623 --> 00:16:00,885
in our team duel matchups. Yes, of course, sir.
The way I determine a winner between the two

170
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:06,047
teams is by running 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations
between every character on each team using

171
00:16:06,087 --> 00:16:11,570
their statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation is
a probabilistic model used to determine outcomes

172
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:16,812
through random sampling. In this case, I randomize
the statistics along a normal distribution

173
00:16:17,152 --> 00:16:21,750
as a way to simulate the many variables that
can occur during battle. The stat parameters

174
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:26,172
are based on the official Marvel power grid,
from which the DC characters' statistics are

175
00:16:26,212 --> 00:16:32,214
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are
included such as range, damage potential, versatility

176
00:16:32,335 --> 00:16:37,357
and perception, in order to create a more detailed
and accurate simulation. The results of the

177
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:42,899
49,000 simulations provide a percentage of wins
for each character on both teams. The team

178
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:46,981
with the higher average win rate is declared
the victor, as they have a higher probability

179
00:16:47,021 --> 00:16:52,537
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,
neither team should win 100% of the matches.

180
00:16:52,898 --> 00:16:57,142
The comic book stories have shown that there's
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so

181
00:16:57,182 --> 00:17:01,045
the confidence rate of my method falls in line
with the precedents that have been established

182
00:17:01,065 --> 00:17:06,671
in the source material. My mathematical simulations
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are

183
00:17:06,691 --> 00:17:12,656
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes
tabulated for determination of the winner.

184
00:17:12,676 --> 00:17:17,999
Thanks, Adrian, I'm K. Before we run the simulations
though, we like to break down each team's histories

185
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:24,400
and rosters before improvising a scenario on
how we imagine one of the thousands of simulations

186
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:29,262
we run would play out beat for beat. And it's
my turn to go first with the Marvel team's

187
00:17:29,302 --> 00:17:34,683
backstory, so let me go ahead and tell you all
about X-Force. The origins of the X-Force team

188
00:17:34,723 --> 00:17:39,844
are actually found within another group known
as the New Mutants, a team of young heroes

189
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:44,962
formed by Professor X when he mistakenly believed
his X-Men had perished. Though the Professor

190
00:17:44,982 --> 00:17:49,924
was reluctant to form a new team, Xavier decided
that he could still mentor young mutants in

191
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:55,327
the use of their powers without sending them
into combat. However, combat found the young

192
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:59,589
team and the new mutants were in near constant
struggles against outside enemies and their

193
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:04,771
own inner demons despite Professor X's wishes.
You can learn more about Professor X and his

194
00:18:04,811 --> 00:18:10,846
duel against the Chief and more about the X-Men
in their team duel against the Titans. Eventually,

195
00:18:11,066 --> 00:18:17,228
the time traveling cyborg mutant soldier named
Cable took charge of the new mutants and restructured

196
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:21,390
it into a strike team that would take a more
proactive approach against threats against

197
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:27,793
mutant kind. More specifically, against threats
posed by Cable's clone named Strife, who had

198
00:18:27,853 --> 00:18:33,695
formed a terrorist mutant group called the Mutant
Liberation Front. Cable took the young heroes

199
00:18:33,775 --> 00:18:38,917
under his wing, radicalizing them in his more
extreme methods, which prompted several members

200
00:18:38,977 --> 00:18:45,990
to leave. including Warlock, Wolfsbane, Richter,
and Sunspot, leaving only Cannonball and Boom

201
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:52,414
left on the team. This resulted in Cable recruiting
new members, Warpath, Shatterstar, Feral, and

202
00:18:52,534 --> 00:18:58,218
Domino. Together they formed a new group that
Cable monocled X-Force, a group existing between

203
00:18:58,258 --> 00:19:03,982
Professor X's pacifist ideals and Magneto's
hostile aggression. The team fought against

204
00:19:04,062 --> 00:19:09,145
Genesis, a disciple of Apocalypse who hired
their mercenary Deadpool to attack X-Force.

205
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:14,890
They also battled Strife's Mutant Liberation
Front, Juggernaut and Black Tom Cassidy, the

206
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:20,915
Immortal Mutant Externals, the Parasitic Phalanx
Aliens, and even the International Espionage

207
00:19:20,975 --> 00:19:26,801
Organization SHIELD after getting on their radar
for their brutal, uncompromising methods. In

208
00:19:26,821 --> 00:19:31,705
their adventures, they brought on new recruits
including Siren, Caliban, Meltdown, Bedlam,

209
00:19:31,865 --> 00:19:37,622
and Mirage. When Strife framed Cable for an
assassination attempt on Professor X, X-Force

210
00:19:37,662 --> 00:19:42,366
found themselves without a mentor for a time.
They were taken under the guidance of the mutant

211
00:19:42,386 --> 00:19:48,391
British spy, Pete Wisdom, but they disbanded
not long after. Eventually the cast of a mutant

212
00:19:48,431 --> 00:19:53,935
reality TV show took the name X-Force for their
group, prompting the original team to confront

213
00:19:53,975 --> 00:19:59,620
them and they changed their name to X-Statics.
Later the Scarlet Witch used her reality warping

214
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:04,844
powers during a psychotic break to remove most
of the world's mutant abilities in an event

215
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:10,987
known as M-Day. When Earth's first new mutant
was born, groups around the world raced to

216
00:20:11,027 --> 00:20:17,010
find her, either seeking to protect, experiment
on, or destroy her. As part of the search,

217
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:22,252
Cyclops formed a strike force within the X-Men
team to find the child and protect her from

218
00:20:22,332 --> 00:20:28,835
all threats, creating a new iteration of X-Force,
this time led by Wolverine and consisting of

219
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:36,186
X-23, Warpath, Caliban, and Hepzibah. Ultimately,
it was Cable acting on his own, who was able

220
00:20:36,226 --> 00:20:41,067
to secure the child, naming her Hope Summers
and taking her into the future to protect her.

221
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:46,529
Cyclops retained X-Force as a secret black ops
team tasked with eliminating potential threats

222
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:52,430
to mutant kind, including William Stryker and
his purifiers, and Mr. Sinister and his marauders.

223
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:57,752
Archangel joined the team, and the group operated
out of his area estate in the Colorado Rocky

224
00:20:57,792 --> 00:21:02,433
Mountains. They were also joined by Domino and
Deadpool when they were sent to the future

225
00:21:02,493 --> 00:21:08,880
to help After saving the two and returning to
the present, the team relocated to an island

226
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:13,943
base off the coast of San Francisco. There,
X-Force fought against the mutant Succubus

227
00:21:13,983 --> 00:21:20,487
Selene and her undead army, and later Bastion
and his battalion of Nimrod Sentinels. Eventually,

228
00:21:20,587 --> 00:21:26,350
Cyclops determined the strike force was no longer
necessary, and he had X-Force disbanded. However,

229
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:31,393
Wolverine kept it going in secret, bringing
aboard Psylocke and Phantom X to the team.

230
00:21:31,842 --> 00:21:36,524
They battled the resurrected Apocalypse and
his four horsemen, and the cybernetic Reavers,

231
00:21:36,904 --> 00:21:42,087
during which the zombie cyborg soldier Deathlock
joined. They also opposed the evil psychic

232
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:46,849
entity known as the Shadow King, before Wolverine
revealed the group's existence to the X-Men,

233
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:53,013
and the X-Force disbanded once again. Is Deathlock
a mutant? He's not, but technically neither

234
00:21:53,073 --> 00:21:57,930
is Deadpool. He's a mutate. So the X-Force team
is not just mutants exclusively, like Shatterstar

235
00:21:57,950 --> 00:22:03,692
is not a mutant. Gotcha. He's an alien. Meanwhile,
Cable and Hope returned to the present, where

236
00:22:03,732 --> 00:22:08,853
Cable's techno-organic virus was purged from
his system. With his psychic powers fully unleashed,

237
00:22:09,273 --> 00:22:14,135
Cable began receiving precognitive visions of
the future, and he recruited a new X-Force

238
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:19,516
team to battle the threats that he foresaw,
including new members Hope, Colossus, and Forge.

239
00:22:20,036 --> 00:22:24,558
Together, they stopped numerous threats such
as a public transmode virus infection, and

240
00:22:24,598 --> 00:22:29,562
an alien invasion. However, since the team's
actions were preemptive, X-Force was branded

241
00:22:29,642 --> 00:22:34,206
as terrorists and got on the radar of the Avengers
and had to fight the team to continue their

242
00:22:34,246 --> 00:22:40,171
work. Simultaneously, the Black Ops X-Force
team, now known as the Uncanny X-Force, had

243
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:45,895
continued on, now led by Psylocke, and included
members such as Storm, Bishop, Spiral, and

244
00:22:45,975 --> 00:22:51,440
Puck. One of Cable's premonitions led Hope to
perceive the Uncanny team as a threat, and

245
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:57,043
the two X-Forces fought. They eventually called
a truce, however, and Psylocke's team disbanded.

246
00:22:57,484 --> 00:23:02,767
Eventually, Cable, still beset by his premonitions,
went after the mercenary Deadpool, who at the

247
00:23:02,807 --> 00:23:08,390
time was being tested by the Time Variance Authority
as a potential agent. Cable stole a time harness

248
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:13,413
in an attempt to stop Deadpool from causing
a disaster and to fix his mind from the premonitions.

249
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:19,056
In the process, the time harness merged Cable
with various incarnations of himself across

250
00:23:19,096 --> 00:23:25,200
the time stream, and Cable returned to the present.
back with his techno-organic virus, and without

251
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:31,525
his future premonitions. No longer tied to a
mission, the X-Force team disbanded. When Professor

252
00:23:31,686 --> 00:23:36,910
X, Magneto, and other Mutant leaders developed
their own nation on the mutant island of Krakoa,

253
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:42,715
they found themselves still targeted by foreign
threats and decided to form a Krakoan intelligence

254
00:23:42,815 --> 00:23:48,600
agency, a new special operations squad named
X-Force. You can learn more about Krakoa in

255
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,283
his duel episode against Danny the Street. This
new team was headed by Beast and included Sage,

256
00:23:54,463 --> 00:23:59,646
Wolverine, Domino, Colossus, and Kid Omega,
with special equipment provided for their missions

257
00:23:59,706 --> 00:24:05,728
by Forge. Together, they executed missions to
protect Krakoa's national interests, including

258
00:24:05,768 --> 00:24:11,311
defending against the anti-Krakoan organization
known as Orcus. And that's their backstory

259
00:24:11,351 --> 00:24:16,133
up until recently. For the 7-person X-Force
roster I'll be going with for this team duel,

260
00:24:16,426 --> 00:24:21,408
because all of our team duels include 7 person
rosters. I wanted to pull from across the team's

261
00:24:21,448 --> 00:24:25,851
long and varied history. First off, I chose
the founder of X-Force and its frequent leader,

262
00:24:25,991 --> 00:24:31,314
Cable, who is a physical and psychic powerhouse.
I'm also going with one of the first recruits

263
00:24:31,354 --> 00:24:36,697
of the original team, a founding member, and
one of the group's most frequent members, Domino,

264
00:24:36,957 --> 00:24:42,881
my good luck wildcard. The strongman Warpath
is my third member, who is also an original

265
00:24:42,901 --> 00:24:47,703
member of X-Force. The latter two that I just
mentioned were also members of the X-Force

266
00:24:47,743 --> 00:24:52,165
Special Ops team, which is one of my personal
favorite incarnations of the group and where

267
00:24:52,225 --> 00:24:57,547
I pulled from the remaining four members. This
includes Deadpool, who initially started out

268
00:24:57,587 --> 00:25:03,169
as a mercenary adversary for the team but later
joined them, Archangel, who I consider my aerial

269
00:25:03,209 --> 00:25:08,572
support as one of the only flyers on the group,
Psylocke, another psychic threat, and lastly

270
00:25:08,832 --> 00:25:14,130
X23, who in the comic books is now going by
the code name Talon. which is a name I really

271
00:25:14,170 --> 00:25:19,853
like for her, and that's what I'll be calling
her here instead of X23. Talon not only was

272
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:24,956
a member of the Special Ops Squad, but she's
also serving as a stand-in of sorts for her

273
00:25:25,056 --> 00:25:30,859
father, and I put father in quotes, Wolverine,
and Wolverine has led several versions of X-Force,

274
00:25:30,939 --> 00:25:36,102
but I already used him in the Titans versus
X-Men duel. So that's my roster. To reiterate,

275
00:25:36,542 --> 00:25:44,754
the seven-member X-Force team that I'm going
with for this duel is Cable, Psylocke, Archangel,

276
00:25:45,255 --> 00:25:51,418
Warpath, and X23, now known as Talon. And you
can learn all about their individuel histories

277
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:56,661
in their respective duel episodes. Basically,
this team is as badass as badass gets though.

278
00:25:57,042 --> 00:26:01,284
It is pretty badass. Actually, there are a lot
of tie-ins in their backstory that reminded

279
00:26:01,324 --> 00:26:05,606
me a lot of the Outsiders backstory. The teams
are maybe a little bit more similar than I

280
00:26:05,626 --> 00:26:11,130
would have even thought. But let me get into
the Outsiders backstory. When Lucius Fox a

281
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:15,973
board member of Wayne Enterprises, was kidnapped
during a business trip in the fictional European

282
00:26:16,013 --> 00:26:21,718
country of Markovia during the coup of the country's
monarchy, Batman insisted the Justice League

283
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:26,261
intervene, though he was rejected on the grounds
that the League's presence would be seen as

284
00:26:26,281 --> 00:26:32,166
an involvement in a political conflict. Enraged,
Batman quit the League and enlisted the help

285
00:26:32,206 --> 00:26:38,158
of Black Lightning to rescue Lucius abroad.
While posing as Lucius's brother, Black Lightning

286
00:26:38,198 --> 00:26:43,842
developed a contact within the Markovian revolutionaries
named General Carnes, who worked with the villain

287
00:26:43,862 --> 00:26:49,706
Baron Bedlam to kill King Victor Markov and
take over the country. Carnes was killed, however,

288
00:26:49,986 --> 00:26:54,529
by the sword-wielding Kitana, who blamed him
for selling weapons that killed her family.

289
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:59,613
While Black Lightning was blamed and imprisoned
for the death of Carnes, Batman encountered

290
00:26:59,673 --> 00:27:05,537
Halo, an amnesiac young woman seemingly a victim
of the war in Markovia that possessed energy

291
00:27:05,597 --> 00:27:11,439
powers. and Markovia's chief royal scientist,
Dr. Helga Jace, was imbuing the country's prince,

292
00:27:11,719 --> 00:27:18,201
Bran Markov, with geokinetic powers in order
to protect the crown. Metamorpho, an elemental

293
00:27:18,241 --> 00:27:23,722
shapeshifter, was also in Markovia at the time,
seeking help from Dr. Jace to cure him of his

294
00:27:23,782 --> 00:27:30,964
powers. After Prince Bryan, aka Geoforce, was
shot and left for dead, Batman, Halo, and Metamorpho

295
00:27:31,004 --> 00:27:35,745
were all captured and imprisoned, though Katana
reappeared and helped rescue the heroes from

296
00:27:36,642 --> 00:27:41,643
When GeoForce recovered, the heroes all managed
to work together to overthrow Baron Bedlam,

297
00:27:41,843 --> 00:27:47,224
and rescue Lucius Fox to boot. Impressed by
their abilities and cooperation, Batman convinced

298
00:27:47,324 --> 00:27:52,606
all of the heroes to join him in Gotham City
to train as a new, secret superteam capable

299
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:57,967
of covert missions that the Justice League were
incapable of performing. When Metamorpho wondered

300
00:27:57,987 --> 00:28:03,309
aloud if a group of outsiders like them could
really be a team, it was GeoForce that determined

301
00:28:03,429 --> 00:28:08,086
outsiders should be the team name. Batman led
the Outsiders in numerous missions against

302
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:13,208
villains such as Agent Orange, Meltdown, and
Cryonic Man. They clashed with the Teen Titans,

303
00:28:13,288 --> 00:28:17,889
fought alongside the Justice League, and dealt
with personal struggles, including Kitana's

304
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:24,151
battle against the Yakuza, the betrayal and
death of Geoforce's sister Terra, Halo's abduction

305
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:29,453
by the extradimensional light beings known as
Articles, and the kidnapping of Sapphire Stag,

306
00:28:29,633 --> 00:28:34,814
metamorphosed fiancee, on their wedding day.
After a space mission to stop the Cobra Cult

307
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:39,876
from taking over America, the outsiders traveled
to the subterranean kingdom known as Abyssa,

308
00:28:40,236 --> 00:28:45,538
where Kitana's friend Emily Briggs discovered
her royal heritage and powers, taking on the

309
00:28:45,578 --> 00:28:50,859
codename Looker, and becoming the latest member
to join the team. Eventually, Baron Bedlam

310
00:28:50,899 --> 00:28:57,421
returned to Markovia and kidnapped Princess
Ilona, the fiancée of King Gregor Markov, Geoforce's

311
00:28:57,521 --> 00:29:02,755
older brother. Batman withheld this information
from the team in the hopes that Geoforce would

312
00:29:02,815 --> 00:29:08,397
remain in Gotham, and when the team found out,
Batman was ultimately forced off the team.

313
00:29:08,857 --> 00:29:13,558
After receiving funding from the Kingdom of
Markovia, the Outsiders relocated from Gotham

314
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:19,400
to Los Angeles, establishing their secret headquarters
in an ocean research lab. After several adventures

315
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,570
and a number of scandals, the Outsiders reunited
with Batman to take on Eclipso. after which

316
00:29:24,610 --> 00:29:29,534
they teamed up with Infinity Inc. after PsychoPirate
attempted to pose as Baron Bedlam in Takeover

317
00:29:29,574 --> 00:29:34,378
Markovia. You can learn more about Eclipso and
PsychoPirate in their respective duels against

318
00:29:34,479 --> 00:29:40,243
Malekith and Mastermind. Due to the team's continual
involvement in international affairs, particularly

319
00:29:40,304 --> 00:29:45,488
in Markovia, the US government began hunting
the outsiders as enemies. It was during this

320
00:29:45,528 --> 00:29:51,053
time that Dr. Helga Jace also betrayed the team,
revealed to be a sleeper agent of the robotic

321
00:29:51,133 --> 00:29:56,226
manhunters. brainwashed Metamorpho into attacking
the team, though he was able to eventually

322
00:29:56,306 --> 00:30:01,751
overcome her control and attacked her instead,
resulting in both his and Dr. Jace's death.

323
00:30:02,171 --> 00:30:06,736
After Looker lost her powers, and Halo went
into a coma after battling the Manhunters,

324
00:30:07,196 --> 00:30:12,001
and with the US government still after them,
the Outsiders decided to disband. The team

325
00:30:12,041 --> 00:30:17,094
members later rejoined for the christening of
Geoforce's nephew, Prince Gregor II, and were

326
00:30:17,134 --> 00:30:22,057
forced to team up again to defend the country
from an army of vampires, which killed an entire

327
00:30:22,117 --> 00:30:27,662
village and placed the blame on the Outsiders,
making them international fugitives. During

328
00:30:27,702 --> 00:30:33,786
this time, the Outsiders took on three new members,
the Sorcerer Faust, the Exosuit-Wearing Technocrat,

329
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:41,132
the Kryptonian Superman clone Eradicator, and
a man-beared thing named Wild. Ha ha ha. After

330
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:46,002
defeating the vampires in the Kingdom of Abyssah,
The Outsiders' names were cleared of wrongdoing,

331
00:30:46,202 --> 00:30:51,845
and after some infighting, the teams split into
two factions, one led by Eradicator in Los

332
00:30:51,925 --> 00:30:58,208
Angeles and the other led by Katana in New York.
Eradicator's team clashed with the Feiron Empire,

333
00:30:58,528 --> 00:31:03,750
resulting in widespread destruction and internal
conflicts exacerbated by media distrust and

334
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:09,332
police intervention. The teams eventually reunited
after dealing with betrayal from Faust and

335
00:31:09,372 --> 00:31:15,324
Wild, who they fought against in a hellish dimension.
Dr. Light and a clone of Terra later joined

336
00:31:15,384 --> 00:31:20,829
the team, though it eventually disbanded. Following
the deaths of several Titans at the hands of

337
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:26,473
a mysterious android named Indigo, the Titans
team disbanded, leading Arsenal and Nightwing

338
00:31:26,513 --> 00:31:32,399
to form a new incarnation of the Outsiders with
a metamorpho-revenant named Shift, an Amazon

339
00:31:32,479 --> 00:31:37,663
named Grace, Black Lightning's daughter Thunder,
the daughter of Green Lantern Ellen Scott,

340
00:31:37,803 --> 00:31:43,846
Jade, and the android Indigo. Sponsored by Wayne
Enterprises and operating from a Brooklyn bomb

341
00:31:43,866 --> 00:31:48,408
shelter, the team took a proactive approach
to crime fighting by hunting known criminals.

342
00:31:48,848 --> 00:31:54,129
After defeating the likes of the Joker and Brother
Blood, Huntress briefly joined the team along

343
00:31:54,149 --> 00:31:59,751
with Black Lightning and Captain Marvel Jr.
Eventually, Indigo was revealed to be a traitor

344
00:32:00,031 --> 00:32:05,013
and was actually Brainiac 8, leading to the
Outsiders and Titans teaming up to defeat her.

345
00:32:05,473 --> 00:32:10,483
Kitana eventually joined the new team. proving
invaluable when her Soul Sword was able to

346
00:32:10,523 --> 00:32:15,545
absorb and imprison the demon Sabacc. After
Black Lightning was framed for murder, Nightwing

347
00:32:15,585 --> 00:32:20,987
and Red Hood led a failed breakout from Iron
Heights that resulted in numerous deaths. The

348
00:32:21,027 --> 00:32:26,409
team faked their own deaths and continued operating
covertly with a new roster funded by Green

349
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:32,012
Arrow that now included Captain Boomerang, though
their existence was later exposed by the villainous

350
00:32:32,032 --> 00:32:37,414
Dr. Sivana, and the team was captured by the
government organization Checkmate. who enlisted

351
00:32:37,434 --> 00:32:43,135
them as covert operatives. When one mission
went awry, the team ended up being captured

352
00:32:43,235 --> 00:32:49,397
and tortured in North Korea, forcing Batman
to intervene. Upon their rescue, Nightwing

353
00:32:49,437 --> 00:32:54,559
stepped down as team leader and put Batman back
in charge of the outsiders. Batman's new roster

354
00:32:54,619 --> 00:33:00,500
included Shazam, Martian Manhunter, Catwoman,
the Batgirl Cassandra Kane, and Green Arrow,

355
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:06,438
with Geoforce and Looker joining the ever-shifting
roster later on as well. When Batman seemingly

356
00:33:06,498 --> 00:33:12,181
died, in his will he ordered Alfred Pennyworth
to assemble a new team of outsiders consisting

357
00:33:12,221 --> 00:33:19,666
of Black Lightning, Creeper, Geoforce, Halo,
Kitana, Metamorpho, and Owlman, who together

358
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:25,029
worked to stop immortals known as the Insiders
from destroying the planet. After the Flashpoint

359
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:30,159
reset of DC's continuity, It was revealed that
Batman put together a secret team consisting

360
00:33:30,199 --> 00:33:35,581
of Black Lightning, Metamorpho, Geoforce Kitana,
and Halo to investigate a mystery concerning

361
00:33:35,641 --> 00:33:40,443
specific metals and their ties to the existence
of metahumans, though Black Lightning later

362
00:33:40,484 --> 00:33:46,026
formed his own Outsiders team consisting of
Kitana, Cassandra Cain, and the new hero, Signal,

363
00:33:46,226 --> 00:33:51,348
Gotham City's daytime protector. Now, for my
Outsiders roster, each member of which you

364
00:33:51,368 --> 00:33:55,822
can learn more about in their respective duel
episodes, I will be going with the original

365
00:33:55,862 --> 00:34:02,505
members of Black Lightning, Katana, Metamorpho,
Geoforce, and Halo as each of them have had

366
00:34:02,565 --> 00:34:08,067
recurring memberships on the team throughout
its many incarnations. Noticeably absent on

367
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:13,109
this roster will be Batman, which seems strange
considering oftentimes the Outsiders comic

368
00:34:13,169 --> 00:34:18,692
is titled Batman and the Outsiders, but it was
for that very reason that to me he felt more

369
00:34:18,732 --> 00:34:24,266
like a benefactor of the group, an outsider
to the Outsiders as it were. And since to me

370
00:34:24,306 --> 00:34:29,028
Batman is more of a Justice Leagueer, the executive
producers and I didn't have too many qualms

371
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:33,429
about leaving Kim off the team since he has
already been a part of one of our team duels.

372
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:40,953
Replacing Kim will be Cassandra Cain, aka Batgirl,
or Orphan, or Black Bat, who's been a member

373
00:34:40,993 --> 00:34:45,754
of the team's more recent incarnations. And
lastly, since I didn't have room to include

374
00:34:45,834 --> 00:34:52,057
Roy Harper, aka Arsenal, in our Titans vs X-Men
team duel, I knew I wanted to make sure he

375
00:34:52,097 --> 00:34:57,072
was on the Outsiders, since he was a founder
of a prominent incarnation of the Super Team.

376
00:34:57,472 --> 00:35:04,916
So that's Black Lightning, Kitana, Metamorpho,
Geoforce, Halo, Black Bat, and Arsenal. It's

377
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:10,919
really interesting how many similarities these
teams have, including the fact that we're substituting

378
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:16,182
some of the key members of these respective
teams with their young female proteges, including

379
00:35:16,342 --> 00:35:23,090
Black Bat substituting in for Batman and Talon
X-23 substituting in for Wolverine. Yeah, I

380
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:27,173
also thought it was interesting that they both
had like split versions of the teams that like

381
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:32,156
battled each other for a bit. Yeah, it's really
strange when all these things start aligning

382
00:35:32,176 --> 00:35:36,759
that you didn't expect to. You find out that
it's an even better idea than anybody even

383
00:35:36,779 --> 00:35:43,304
knew. It's wild when, you know, Marvel essentially
just copies DC. They find all the different

384
00:35:43,344 --> 00:35:47,727
ways in which that's the case. There are clearly
some things that happened in the outsiders

385
00:35:47,747 --> 00:35:50,989
team after they happened to X-Force. So I don't
want to hear it.

386
00:35:57,422 --> 00:36:03,088
Where fantasies collide and heroes clash, one
podcast network rises above the rest. Prepare

Visit dynamicpodcast.com where we settle the
debate and settle the score.

393
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:48,026
But now that we got the team's histories and
rosters out of the way, let's speculate on

394
00:36:48,086 --> 00:36:53,670
how one of the 1000 simulated matches will go.
The winner is determined by simulations, not

395
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:58,775
the speculation, but it's fun to imagine how
the fight could play out. AG and IK, what are

396
00:36:58,795 --> 00:37:04,079
the rules of our speculation? Well, I should
say there are no rules, other than the teams

397
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:08,663
have no prior knowledge of the other going into
the fight. All they are aware of starting out

398
00:37:09,023 --> 00:37:13,698
is that the other side is a threat that needs
to be eliminated. For the speculation, the

399
00:37:13,738 --> 00:37:18,260
groups will begin approximately 50 meters apart
in a non-descript environment that will have

400
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:23,502
no bearing on the match itself, as no environmental
statistics are considered in my simulations.

401
00:37:23,982 --> 00:37:29,184
The teams must earn victory on their own merit.
Alright then, let's get into it. The Outsiders

402
00:37:29,525 --> 00:37:34,547
and X-Force meet on the battlefield. Who goes
first? Actually, Deadpool is going to start

403
00:37:34,587 --> 00:37:38,588
off by signaling, time out! He's going to be
like, time out, time out! And he's going to

404
00:37:38,608 --> 00:37:42,662
speak directly to our listeners, and he's going
to be like... You better get your white pants

405
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:46,944
on nerds, it's gonna get good. And he was like,
alright time in, we can commence with the fighting

406
00:37:46,984 --> 00:37:51,726
now. Okay, before he even finishes that last
sentence though, Arsenal's just gonna shoot

407
00:37:51,746 --> 00:37:56,208
him right in the head with an arrow. So Deadpool
is knocked out and he's gonna fall straight

408
00:37:56,228 --> 00:38:03,010
to the ground. Alright, okay that's fine. Archangel
is gonna spread his metal wings and he's gonna

409
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:09,573
take into the sky and just rain down a shower
of razor feathers that's gonna slice into the

410
00:38:09,613 --> 00:38:15,551
entire Outsiders team. and poison them with
a neurotoxin that paralyzes them. Ah, okay.

411
00:38:15,571 --> 00:38:21,752
Uh, but Metamorpho, he's gonna stretch his hands
up and he's gonna transform his hands into

412
00:38:22,113 --> 00:38:27,774
a metal shield that protects the outsiders from
those feathers. Okay, so the feathers stick

413
00:38:27,834 --> 00:38:32,855
into Metamorpho's shield, which is his hand,
so the metal feathers are still gonna poison

414
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:38,297
him and seep into his system. Well, no, because
Metamorpho, he's actually immune to poisons

415
00:38:38,337 --> 00:38:44,120
due to his, you know, composition and he could
reproduce the elemental makeup of whatever

416
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:50,945
he comes into contact with so in fact he's gonna
reproduce that neurotoxin in his body and become

417
00:38:51,025 --> 00:38:57,649
a poisonous cloud that spreads across the X-Force
team paralyzing them. Okay I'm gonna say that

418
00:38:57,669 --> 00:39:04,014
before Metamorphro can even spread himself out
over the X-Force team Cable's gonna reach out

419
00:39:04,034 --> 00:39:11,198
with his telekinesis to grab this poison cloud
and dissipate him into the sky. So Metamorpho,

420
00:39:11,438 --> 00:39:15,339
he's like in the upper atmosphere now and he's
gonna have to take some time to reconstitute

421
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:21,861
himself. Meanwhile, Talon, X23, she's gonna
scramble across the battlefield over to Katana

422
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:27,903
and she's gonna handspring kick her with her
foot claws, just slashing her across the chest.

423
00:39:27,963 --> 00:39:33,904
No, because like in one smooth fluid motion,
Katana is gonna unsheath her sword and just

424
00:39:34,124 --> 00:39:40,283
expertly deflect Talon's foot claws and then
she's gonna... transfer that momentum from

425
00:39:40,323 --> 00:39:46,307
her defensive move into like a counter strike
that is going to slash Talon across her back.

426
00:39:46,847 --> 00:39:52,911
Okay Talon's in pain but she's used to pain
okay and without missing a beat she's gonna

427
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:57,715
continue her claw fight against Katana's. Really
I assume neither of their blades would break

428
00:39:57,755 --> 00:40:04,319
against each other considering Talon's blades
are adamantium and Katana's blade is magic.

429
00:40:04,659 --> 00:40:08,694
Yeah her sword is unbreakable and it could basically
cut through anything. I'm guessing you're going

430
00:40:08,714 --> 00:40:14,658
to say not adamantium. So yeah, Talon and Katana,
they're going to get it. Meanwhile, Geoforce,

431
00:40:14,978 --> 00:40:20,302
he's going to use his Geokinesis to rip the
ground up into like a series of boulders. And

432
00:40:20,322 --> 00:40:25,466
he's going to hurl those at Warpath, increasing
their gravity to just bury him. Well, no matter

433
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:30,569
how heavy these boulders are, they're still
made out of earth, right? And Warpath is super

434
00:40:30,629 --> 00:40:34,392
durable and strong. So he's just going to punch
his way out from underneath these boulders.

435
00:40:34,912 --> 00:40:39,275
And then he's going to pick one of them up.
and curl it over at Black Lightning to squashing

436
00:40:39,295 --> 00:40:43,798
him. OK, force field. You know, Black Lightning
throws up his force field, which blocks against,

437
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:49,762
you know, metal and energy projectiles. So that
does literally nothing to. No, no, no. Boulder's

438
00:40:49,802 --> 00:40:54,446
not made out of metal. It's made out of like
earth, like silicon, right? There's enough

439
00:40:54,526 --> 00:41:02,851
metallic elements in the boulder for it to be
deflected. OK. Anyway, Domino is going to run

440
00:41:02,891 --> 00:41:07,722
over to Deadpool and yank Arsenal's arrow out
of his brain. So Deadpool starts coming to

441
00:41:07,762 --> 00:41:13,844
and he's like back from the dead, just like
Marvel Jesus. And Domino takes Arsenal's arrow

442
00:41:13,864 --> 00:41:19,225
and she's going to hurl it like a dart right
at Black Bat. And the arrow is going to be

443
00:41:19,385 --> 00:41:25,207
aided by Domino's luck powers. So it's just
going to bullseye Black Bat right in the face.

444
00:41:25,227 --> 00:41:29,748
Well, no, because Black Bat, she could just
catch that arrow mid air because she has her

445
00:41:30,028 --> 00:41:34,289
kinesthetic intuition ability. She could read
what Domino's doing and going to. No, no, no.

446
00:41:34,866 --> 00:41:40,329
Luck powers supersede intuition. Okay, so even
though Black Bat tries to catch the arrow,

447
00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:46,272
her bad luck is gonna lead to the arrow just
sticking right into her hand. Those luck powers

448
00:41:46,412 --> 00:41:53,656
are the lamest thing. I hate it, but sure, okay.
Black Bat, you know, her hand gets pierced,

449
00:41:53,696 --> 00:41:57,918
but she's gonna break the arrow off and, you
know, has a hand injury now, but she could

450
00:41:57,958 --> 00:42:04,241
roll with it. Meanwhile, Halo, she's gonna turn
the color indigo and she's gonna put Deadpool.

451
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:09,929
into a energy field, a tractor beam, and she's
just gonna hurl him toward the horizon, just

452
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:14,452
away from the battlefield. Are you gonna let
him do anything during this match? I think,

453
00:42:14,552 --> 00:42:18,995
in fact, he actually yells those exact words
as he disappears from view. He's gonna be like,

454
00:42:19,055 --> 00:42:25,820
are you gonna let me do anything, Johnny DC,
you cock knocker? Nope. Meanwhile, Psylocke,

455
00:42:26,501 --> 00:42:31,724
using her stealth, she's gonna sneak up behind
Geoforce, and she's gonna plunge her psychic

456
00:42:31,784 --> 00:42:36,624
knife right into the back of his head. stunning
him. Okay, but Geoforce, he's not going to

457
00:42:36,644 --> 00:42:42,749
be stunned for long because her hand gets knocked
away from Geoforce's head with a boxing glove

458
00:42:42,849 --> 00:42:48,173
arrow from Arsenal's quiver, and he's going
to follow that up by firing two cryo arrows

459
00:42:48,513 --> 00:42:53,778
like in quick succession at her feet, trapping
her in place. Big deal. She's going to break

460
00:42:53,838 --> 00:42:59,502
out of the ice by shattering it with her telekinesis,
and then she's going to hurl a telepathic blade

461
00:42:59,723 --> 00:43:04,986
at Arsenal, and you know, he's going to try
to because that's what he does, but he's not

462
00:43:05,006 --> 00:43:09,768
going to know that her blade is psychic energy.
And so he's not going to be able to do anything

463
00:43:09,808 --> 00:43:16,111
about it. And the psychic blade hits him and
he gets mentally knocked out. Meanwhile, Deadpool,

464
00:43:16,391 --> 00:43:22,393
he's going to come back onto the scene with
Archangel who went to go get him. And Deadpool

465
00:43:22,773 --> 00:43:28,035
is writing Archangel kind of like Sebastian
at the end of the never ending story. He's

466
00:43:28,055 --> 00:43:33,750
going to be like, Falcor is wonderful. And he
leaps off of Archangel's back. You know, he's

467
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:39,054
going to do a superhero landing next to Black
Bat, and he's going to pull out his swords

468
00:43:39,614 --> 00:43:44,558
and be like, Hello, Black Bat, I'm White Wade
Wilson. Is your power cultural appropriation?

469
00:43:44,578 --> 00:43:51,282
Dude, he doesn't even know what race she is.
It doesn't matter. OK. I'm not going to lie.

470
00:43:51,362 --> 00:43:57,367
Like Deadpool's body language is probably super
challenging for Black Bat to read. I imagine

471
00:43:57,647 --> 00:44:03,095
he's pretty unpredictable. So she's disoriented.
And because of that, she's going to throw down

472
00:44:03,195 --> 00:44:09,540
a pellet with knockout gas that just puts him
to sleep. All right. Once again, before he

473
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:14,164
gets to do anything, you're trying to take him
down. So Deadpool falls asleep. And as he's

474
00:44:14,204 --> 00:44:18,247
dozing off, he's probably going to be like,
don't hurt me, Liam Neeson or something. Well,

475
00:44:20,169 --> 00:44:26,233
by this point, Metamorpho has reconstituted
and, you know, seeing Katana and Talon battling.

476
00:44:26,754 --> 00:44:31,515
He's gonna turn the lower half of his body into
a straight jacket that just wraps around Talon,

477
00:44:32,076 --> 00:44:36,938
while the upper half of his body is still in
his standard form, except for his hands. He's

478
00:44:36,958 --> 00:44:42,200
gonna turn those into mallets and he's just
gonna pummel Talon mercilessly. Okay, so Talon

479
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:46,182
is in a straight jacket and getting beat up,
but a straight jacket's not gonna cover her

480
00:44:46,262 --> 00:44:53,084
legs. So while Metamorpho thinks he has her
restrained, she's just gonna kick her leg up

481
00:44:53,185 --> 00:44:58,203
and slice off both of his hammer hands. with
her foot claws and then she escapes the straitjacket.

482
00:44:58,623 --> 00:45:05,445
Meanwhile, Cable is gonna pull out his BFG.
You know what that stands for? Big Friendly

483
00:45:05,526 --> 00:45:12,708
Giant. Stands for Big Fucking Gun, man. It's
a giant energy rifle and Cable's gonna use

484
00:45:12,748 --> 00:45:18,091
it to shoot a hail of energy rounds at GeoForce,
just perforating the guy. Okay, well I mean,

485
00:45:18,611 --> 00:45:25,946
how well does a BFG stand up against a BFV?
A big fucking volcano. That's what's gonna

486
00:45:26,026 --> 00:45:32,950
erupt from the ground around Geoforce, blocking
Cable's blasts. And Geoforce, he's in the center

487
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:38,753
of this, like 30 foot tall mountain that shoots
him into the sky as it erupts. And from the

488
00:45:38,913 --> 00:45:45,297
air, Geoforce is gonna bombard Cable with beams
of magma. So Geoforce creates a volcano that

489
00:45:45,337 --> 00:45:50,639
shoots him up into the air? Yeah. That's pretty
cool. But if it's only 30 feet tall, that sounds

490
00:45:50,659 --> 00:45:56,443
more like a little baby volcano than a big fucking
volcano. Whatever. But Cable's gonna throw

491
00:45:56,463 --> 00:46:01,806
up a telekinetic shield to block the magma and
you know, the sky's Archangel's domain So that

492
00:46:01,826 --> 00:46:06,930
was stupid like Geo Force is focused on burning
up Cable when all of a sudden he gets sliced

493
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:14,315
in half by Archangel's metal wings and Geo Force
is the first one out in this match. What? No,

494
00:46:14,635 --> 00:46:21,260
I thought he was gonna be like my last one He's
like my most powerful guy Okay. Well, I do

495
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:27,002
have one question for you Do you know what happens
to an angel when it's struck by lightning?

496
00:46:27,563 --> 00:46:32,784
It croaks. The same thing that happens to everything
else. Cause that's exactly what's gonna happen

497
00:46:32,804 --> 00:46:37,845
to Archangel. Black Lightning, you know, he
saw what happened to Geoforce. And since Archangel's

498
00:46:37,905 --> 00:46:43,487
wings are made of metal, he's like a great conductor
of electricity. So Black Lightning channels

499
00:46:43,707 --> 00:46:49,949
this massive lightning bolt that just completely
fries Archangel to a crisp in the sky. So Archangel

500
00:46:50,029 --> 00:46:55,632
is out as well. All right, okay. Well, I'm going
to say that the thunder from Black Lightning's

501
00:46:55,812 --> 00:47:01,217
lightning bolt is going to wake up Deadpool
and Arsenal, who was, you know, knocked out

502
00:47:01,237 --> 00:47:05,982
by Psylocke. And Deadpool sits up and he's going
to be like, where did that little baby volcano

503
00:47:06,022 --> 00:47:12,067
come from? Oh, my God. Are those twin gold plated
desert eagles you're carrying? And he's going

504
00:47:12,087 --> 00:47:16,592
to point at Arsenal's guns and Arsenal's going
to look down at his holster and he's going

505
00:47:16,612 --> 00:47:23,079
to be like, uh, no. Well, Deadpool's like, I
need them for my collection. And he's going

506
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:28,002
to teleport over to Arsenal and right away slice
off his gun holster with his swords and knock

507
00:47:28,042 --> 00:47:31,784
the guns up into the air. And Deadpool's going
to catch him and just pump Arsenal full of

508
00:47:31,824 --> 00:47:39,668
lead. And then Deadpool's going to be like,
wait, these aren't gold. Okay. Well, as Deadpool

509
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:45,211
comes to that realization, the guns actually
get sliced in half, followed up by his own

510
00:47:45,251 --> 00:47:51,354
decapitation, all thanks to Katana's soul taker
sword. So Deadpool's out of the match. Fine.

511
00:47:52,514 --> 00:47:59,837
Meanwhile, Metamorpho, who just regrew his hands,
he hears a beeping sound. And he realizes that

512
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:05,578
a sticky explosive mine has been thrown onto
his back. And he's going to spin around and

513
00:48:05,618 --> 00:48:11,480
see Domino is the one who threw the mine. And
with a smile, she's going to shoot right through

514
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:17,321
Metamorpho, hitting the explosive that stuck
to his back in this unbelievably lucky shot.

515
00:48:17,802 --> 00:48:23,083
and the mine is gonna detonate with a sizable
explosion that just sends chunks of metamorpho

516
00:48:23,443 --> 00:48:29,885
scattered across the battlefield. All right.
So, Halo sees this and goes on the offensive

517
00:48:29,945 --> 00:48:36,947
against Domino. She turns yellow and flashes
at Domino, blinding her, which I believe negates

518
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:43,609
Domino's luck powers since they depend on her
vision, right? Right. So, bad luck for Domino,

519
00:48:43,829 --> 00:48:50,484
Halo then turns red and just beams at giant
hole right through Domino's torso, taking her

520
00:48:50,544 --> 00:48:56,649
out of the match. Good one. That was good. Well,
Warpath saw what Halo did, and he just throws

521
00:48:56,689 --> 00:49:02,454
his vibranium knives like two tomahawks right
at Halo and the knives impale her and take

522
00:49:02,474 --> 00:49:08,719
her out of this match, too. Yeah, no, the Halo
Warpath threw his knives at just dissipated

523
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:13,022
into blue light when the blades went through
her because there was a hologram created by

524
00:49:13,062 --> 00:49:20,979
Halo. And that's when Black Bat She's going
to swoop in and stealthily land on Warpath's

525
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:25,121
shoulders. And before he could do anything,
she's going to be striking nerve points across

526
00:49:25,161 --> 00:49:30,404
his body in rapid succession, just paralyzing
Kim and making him useless for the rest of

527
00:49:30,424 --> 00:49:36,207
the match. OK, well, Psylocke sees this and
she jumps in and fights Black Bat, you know,

528
00:49:36,267 --> 00:49:42,229
ninja versus ninja. And like maybe Black Bat
gets a few good hits in there. But suddenly.

529
00:49:42,818 --> 00:49:47,399
Black Bat realizes she can't read Psylocke's
moves anymore because her mind is all fuzzy.

530
00:49:47,919 --> 00:49:53,961
And that's because Psylocke telepathically clouds
her brain. And then she deals her coup de grace

531
00:49:54,141 --> 00:49:59,382
with a telekinetic sword right through Black
Bat's torso. So Black Bat's gone. And you know

532
00:49:59,402 --> 00:50:06,424
what? I'm not even angry. Black Bat went out
with honor, but not by Psylocke. Before Psylocke

533
00:50:06,604 --> 00:50:12,846
could deal the final blow, Katana's Soul Sword
warned her of Black Bat's imminent death. And

534
00:50:12,886 --> 00:50:17,728
so Katana, she moved really quick over to Black
Bat and made sure that she trapped Cassandra's

535
00:50:17,788 --> 00:50:22,771
soul and her sword by delivering that killing
blow. And that's going to give Katana not only

536
00:50:22,871 --> 00:50:28,455
Black Bat's kinesthetic intuition, but also
her martial arts mastery and knowledge of Psylocke's

537
00:50:28,595 --> 00:50:33,878
psychic powers. And since Katana's sword can
block things that are immaterial, like psychic

538
00:50:33,938 --> 00:50:39,361
blades, the two are just going to clash and
sword on sword action. But ultimately, with

539
00:50:39,401 --> 00:50:43,722
Black Bat's aid, Katana's gonna come on top
and she's just gonna impale Psylocke with her

540
00:50:43,762 --> 00:50:49,364
sword and steal her soul as well. That doesn't
make any sense. So Katana took out her own

541
00:50:49,444 --> 00:50:56,027
teammate in order to get her teammates abilities.
It's like friendly seppuku, okay? But just

542
00:50:56,047 --> 00:51:01,448
because Katana would be aware then that Psylocke
probably has psychic powers, that doesn't make

543
00:51:01,608 --> 00:51:07,787
her immune to Psylocke's psychic attacks. Wha-
Katana can't be easily affected psychically

544
00:51:07,827 --> 00:51:12,249
because the soul of her husband talks to her
all the time through the sword, you know, feeding

545
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:17,471
her information, and he'd warn her and tell
her how to move and dodge and parry and slash

546
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:22,613
and stuff if Psylocke tried to affect Katana
psychically, like through illusions or clouding

547
00:51:22,633 --> 00:51:31,217
or anything like that. Uh, okay, alright. If
you say so. I do! I think that's a reach. Uh,

548
00:51:31,257 --> 00:51:37,007
so suddenly Katana dies. because Cable lifts
her up by her neck with his metal tech arm

549
00:51:37,047 --> 00:51:42,009
and just snaps the life out of her. Dude, she
would literally slice that metal arm right

550
00:51:42,129 --> 00:51:46,671
the hell off before he could even do that. Not
if Cable telekinetically keeps her from swinging

551
00:51:46,691 --> 00:51:54,514
that sword. Fuck! So she's out. Meanwhile, Talon
is going up against Halo. And Halo, you know,

552
00:51:54,554 --> 00:52:01,317
she could probably block Talon's attacks with
her orange force field. But Cable has the ability

553
00:52:01,397 --> 00:52:07,031
to... telepathically compel Halo to drop her
forcefield. And that's gonna leave her vulnerable

554
00:52:07,071 --> 00:52:14,933
to Talon, who just rips Halo to shreds. No!
Okay, well, you know what's cool though? Both

555
00:52:14,973 --> 00:52:20,055
of your guys that are left, Cable and Talon,
they have conductive metal throughout their

556
00:52:20,075 --> 00:52:26,417
body. So while Cable is busy with Katana and
Halo, his metal arm just gets slammed with

557
00:52:26,617 --> 00:52:30,926
millions of volts of electricity from Black
Lightning. who also is going to chain that

558
00:52:31,126 --> 00:52:37,871
off of him to Talon. So both of them basically
get electrocuted to death. And bam, Black Lightning

559
00:52:37,911 --> 00:52:43,794
emerges victorious. Oh, you think so? OK, right?
Well, Black Lightning thinks that he's won.

560
00:52:44,134 --> 00:52:50,258
A little Deadpool emerges looking like a naked
troll doll with a mask on because his decapitated

561
00:52:50,298 --> 00:52:56,418
head is regrowing his body. And like a weird
baby, he stumbles over to Cable's body. and

562
00:52:56,458 --> 00:53:02,439
steals his time travel device and he uses it
to travel through time and the multiverse and

563
00:53:02,459 --> 00:53:07,881
he's gonna pop back onto the battlefield the
moment he left with a whole legion of Deadpool

564
00:53:07,901 --> 00:53:13,262
variants, the Deadpool core and Deadpool's gonna
lead them into battle he's gonna be like FOR

565
00:53:13,302 --> 00:53:19,764
FREEDOM and they're gonna swarm black lightning
and just massacre the guy like it's not pretty

566
00:53:20,344 --> 00:53:25,185
and then with the battle over Deadpool says
to our listeners those shit fucks down the

567
00:53:25,225 --> 00:53:31,393
street never stood a chance and he does the
X salute and he's like X force match over.

568
00:53:31,694 --> 00:53:37,878
Except that as he's doing the salute he's gonna
get clocked by Shift which is a sentient Metamorpho

569
00:53:37,938 --> 00:53:42,341
remnant who was a part of the Outsiders for
a time and you know he turned his fist into

570
00:53:42,361 --> 00:53:47,605
an anvil and just punches the lights out of
Deadpool and in fact actually with all the

571
00:53:47,645 --> 00:53:53,369
scattered pieces of Metamorpho around the battlefield
there's an army of shifts just ready to take

572
00:53:53,429 --> 00:53:59,347
on the Deadpool core. So good luck with that.
I'm going to say that Metamorpho was blown

573
00:53:59,448 --> 00:54:05,810
up into two smaller pieces to actually form
an army of Metamorphos. Metamorpho has like

574
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:12,373
literally been vaporized multiple times and
he's always come back. So has Deadpool. Unless

575
00:54:12,433 --> 00:54:17,335
you have like a magic sorcerer supreme Deadpool
because that's really the only way Metamorpho

576
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:22,277
can be taken out is magically. Then I think
this match would just basically go on forever.

577
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:29,033
I'm sorry to tell you one of the Deadpool variants
is the Sorcerer Supreme. So there you go. And

578
00:54:29,093 --> 00:54:34,436
I think you're making that shit up. Well, we
could go ahead and leave the match there. Either

579
00:54:34,556 --> 00:54:40,639
the Deadpool core beats this legion of Metamorphos
or the Metamorphos beat the Deadpool core.

580
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:46,122
We'll go ahead and input the stats on all these
characters, run the simulations and see which

581
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:53,502
team came out on top. AJ9K, hit it! Inputting
data, running calculations. Processing results.

582
00:54:54,023 --> 00:54:59,667
Simulations complete. All right, this was a
great matchup. These teams are very, very close.

583
00:55:00,287 --> 00:55:04,470
They were close thematically. They were close
in terms of their backstories, and they're

584
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:10,675
even close statistically. Cable was by far the
most powerful member out of either of these

585
00:55:10,715 --> 00:55:18,121
groups. But the outsiders were no slouch either.
Black Lightning, Metamorpho, Geoforce, they

586
00:55:18,141 --> 00:55:23,872
were all heavy hitters. Yeah, Geoforce was my
heaviest, followed closely behind by Metamorpho,

587
00:55:24,372 --> 00:55:30,816
and Black Lightning was just under him. Yeah,
actually both Geoforce and Metamorpho won around

588
00:55:30,896 --> 00:55:36,639
3 fourths of all of their matches, and Black
Lightning won about 3 fifths of his matches.

589
00:55:37,179 --> 00:55:42,622
Cable, though, won like 4 out of 5 of all his
matches, but the rest of my guys didn't do

590
00:55:42,682 --> 00:55:48,405
as well. Like, Deadpool, Psylocke, Archangel,
they all came out around the same statistically.

591
00:55:48,842 --> 00:55:54,607
winning just about half of their matchups. My
second most powerful guy was actually Warpath,

592
00:55:54,687 --> 00:55:59,391
who won a little bit over half of his matchups.
Yeah, not too many of my team members were

593
00:55:59,431 --> 00:56:04,656
around that 50 percent mark. I had some that
were either like three fourths winning or one

594
00:56:04,676 --> 00:56:11,122
fourth winning. So, you know, it varied quite
a bit. My weakest character by far, surprisingly,

595
00:56:11,482 --> 00:56:17,654
was Kitana. Yeah, she's not impressive statistically,
is she? No, not even compared to some of your

596
00:56:17,694 --> 00:56:23,196
weaker characters. She only won one fifth out
of every match, basically. Yeah, if you think

597
00:56:23,236 --> 00:56:28,497
about it, Katana has the ability to steal your
soul if she kills you, right? But like, as

598
00:56:28,578 --> 00:56:33,139
a superpower, that's kind of lame because you'd
be dead anyway, right? It was a power that

599
00:56:33,219 --> 00:56:38,921
didn't help her in the stats, really. In terms
of the overall team stats, the biggest discrepancy

600
00:56:38,981 --> 00:56:44,139
between these two teams was fighting skill.
and versatility. Like the outsiders were way

601
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:49,663
more versatile than the X-Force who are mainly
just you know like shoot and stab guys, but

602
00:56:49,923 --> 00:56:55,027
X-Force was much more trained in hand-to-hand
combat than the outsiders. Which is wild because

603
00:56:55,167 --> 00:57:00,571
I feel like I had the best fighter in Black
Bat. Yeah you had Black Bat and Katana, but

604
00:57:00,591 --> 00:57:05,154
you also had Halo who really brought your team
down. Whereas everyone in X-Force is like an

605
00:57:05,234 --> 00:57:11,222
expert fighter almost. X-Force also had the
edge in durability and strength but the outsiders

606
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:17,103
had the edge in damage level and range. So taking
all this into consideration, Jonathan, considering

607
00:57:17,143 --> 00:57:21,404
how close things are, who do you see coming
out on top here? Well, it's definitely closer

608
00:57:21,465 --> 00:57:24,885
than I thought it was going to be. I thought
the outsiders were totally going to stomp,

609
00:57:25,025 --> 00:57:29,907
but I think the outsiders are still going to
come out ahead just barely. Instagram does

610
00:57:29,947 --> 00:57:36,148
not agree with me. Apparently X-Force is the
more popular team. 62% of our poll takers sided

611
00:57:36,188 --> 00:57:40,806
with Marvel for this team match. And I'm ready
to prove them all wrong. I don't know, they

612
00:57:40,826 --> 00:57:45,969
sound pretty right to me, but let's go ahead
and find out. AJ9K, the results please. Here

613
00:57:45,989 --> 00:57:57,396
you are, sir. Alright the winner between the
Outsiders and X-Force is... X-Force! Damn it!

614
00:57:57,636 --> 00:58:04,560
Suck on that! X-Force wins! It was really damn
close though. Out of 1000 matches, X-Force

615
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:13,380
won 509. whereas the outsiders won 491, basically
a coin toss between these two teams. That is

616
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:18,842
shocking. Again, I did not think it was gonna
be this close. Me and the DC guys on Discord

617
00:58:18,882 --> 00:58:23,744
were like, oh yeah, outsiders is totally gonna
take this one. Haha, Marvel's stupid. I mean,

618
00:58:23,824 --> 00:58:27,786
Marvel's still stupid. But then who turned out
to be stupid, right? Is that what you're gonna

619
00:58:27,826 --> 00:58:35,049
say? No. I am super pleased with these results.
I think X-Horse is just too badass of a team

620
00:58:35,089 --> 00:58:41,725
to lose. to a bunch of nobodies like outsiders
like who the hell has ever heard of Halo? Not

621
00:58:41,785 --> 00:58:47,970
me. Uh, I'm pretty sure more people have heard
of Halo than fucking Warpath. Warpath was in

622
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:54,414
X-Men Days of Future Past. Okay? All of my guys
on the X-Force team have been in movies. Oh,

623
00:58:54,434 --> 00:59:00,178
and guess what? Halo has been in Young Justice
Outsiders. So that again, that's a fucking

624
00:59:00,198 --> 00:59:08,456
cartoon that nobody's watched. Marvel's just
more popular. and they're stronger and in this

625
00:59:08,496 --> 00:59:15,063
case just better overall. But not better looking
because you guys have Deadpool. Sure, but who

626
00:59:15,103 --> 00:59:21,050
cares? He kicked ass this match. Who really
wins? DC. All right. You got to take what you

627
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:26,976
can get, I suppose. Oh, we will. We will. But
that does it for this team duel, guys. AJ and

642
01:00:47,836 --> 01:00:50,999
then I remembered it's after Labor Day and now
I'm just devastated.
