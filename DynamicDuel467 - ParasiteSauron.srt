7
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:09,300
Hi, welcome to the DynaMic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

8
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:13,880
the superiority between Marvel and DC by
comparing their characters in stat-based battle

9
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,880
simulations. I'm Marvelist Joe. And I'm his twin
brother Johnny DC. And in the countdown to the

10
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,040
final episodes of this podcast, we're at number 6,
that means there are 5 episodes left after this

11
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,620
one. Which is Parasite versus Sauron, the
Superman villain against the X-Men villain?

12
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:38,620
Yeah, he's basically a pterodactyl man who lives
in the savage land and also, like Parasite, has the

13
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,920
ability to drain the life energy from his victims
through contact. Yeah, you mentioned last

14
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,260
episode that it was a crime that we had not yet
gotten to a Shadowcat duel. It is an even bigger

15
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,600
crime that it took us so long to get to a Parasite
duel. He's like one of Superman's biggest

16
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,800
villains. Nah, to me that's more like a
misdemeanor, whereas not getting to Kitty Pride

17
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,260
was basically a felony on behalf of the show. Well
not getting to Parasite is a felony with a higher

18
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,580
sentencing, I don't know. Before we get into that
matchup guys, where we input the character stats

19
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,420
and run simulations to find out who would win,
we're going to break down the latest comic book

20
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:16,420
movie news that came out this past week, of which we
have one news item and that is the Supergirl

21
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,240
official teaser trailer. As always, we list our
segment of times in our episode description, so

22
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,660
feel free to check out the show notes if you want to
skip ahead to a particular topic. Our

23
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,540
artificially intelligent duel simulator, AJ9K,

done, on to the news. OK, so last week, DC unveiled

45
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:45,860
the official teaser trailer for the Supergirl
film, which is coming out June 26th next year. Of

46
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:52,040
course, we saw Supergirl at the very end of the
Superman movie that came earlier this summer. She

47
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,840
took crypto with her at the end of the movie, and now
she's going to have her own adventure. Crypto

48
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,860
kicks off this trailer, which is nice to see
because I was a huge fan of the character in the

49
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:06,920
Superman movie. What was not nice to see was how
filthy the living condition Supergirl lives in

50
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:15,600
is. Dog piss and alcohol all over the floor. Bitch,
you nasty. Yeah, I can smell it through the screen

51
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,340
almost. It's not pleasant, but that's her
character, right? She's kind of depressed. Yeah,

52
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:26,120
and the women of tomorrow graphic novel, she is
depressed, having lost crypto and having

53
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,840
witnessed the loss of it, which we partly see in
this trailer as the city that she lived in erects a

54
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,480
force field to protect the city. It doesn't fully
work. I think the ground shielding didn't protect

55
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:43,880
them from the radiation. But the line that Ruthie
asks when what was it like to lose everything in a

56
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:49,220
day and Supergirl responds with Krypton didn't
die in a day. The gods aren't that kind. It was

57
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,260
actually a line from the comic, and I really liked
the way that Millie Alcock delivered it here.

58
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:58,780
She's going to do a pretty good job as Supergirl. I
feel like especially this version of Supergirl,

59
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:04,200
who again is depressed and just kind of trying to
fight it back with alcoholism, essentially, when

60
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,540
she's celebrating her 23rd birthday and saying
it's going to be the best yet, although that's not a

61
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,000
hard bar to clear. You really felt it in her
performance. Yeah, I think she's going to do

62
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,040
better with the drama in the role, better than the
action, I think. Although, you know,

63
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:22,200
Kryptonians, they don't need to be buff. It's not
where they get their strength from. I think my

64
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:28,240
issue with Millie Alcock is just how she's selling
the action more than do I believe she's actually

65
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,580
doing this stuff? Oh, I'm not even going to
disagree with you. Like when she's going up

66
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:38,320
against the guys in that bar brawl with like the
axe, it wasn't really convincing that she was

67
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,280
going to be able to take them, especially since it
appeared they were able to match her strength

68
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,300
wise. And then at the very end, when she's like
pulling on that machine connected to a cable, I was

69
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:54,200
like, I don't think you quite sold that there.
Well, I think maybe that was a special effects

70
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,020
issue at the end there because centrifugal force
doesn't work that way. Like the string would have

71
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:04,560
to be taught going straight out in order for her to
maintain that swinging momentum. It was just

72
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,200
strange. Right. Yeah. Like physics wise, she
would just be pulling that piece of machinery

73
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:15,060
toward her and not in an arc. Exactly. I think it's
just hard for people to believe that this

74
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,420
character has the strength to swing a battle axe
with one arm when it looks like the actress is

75
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:24,440
struggling to do that herself. I'm guessing the
more physical stuff will be done with CGI. And of

76
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,780
course, there's always her powers like heat
vision, which we get to see in this trailer, along

77
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:35,580
with characters like Kram of the Yellow Hills, who
is the villain of this movie. And Lobo, played by

78
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:41,520
Jason Momoa. We don't get a good look at him. But
from what we do see, holy shit, he's going to nail

79
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,440
this. He was born to play this role. Yeah, it was
just a brief glimpse, but it looks spot on.

80
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,920
Regarding the look of the movie as a whole,
Jonathan, how do you feel about DC straight up

81
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:57,920
Xeroxing Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy? And
they're not doing anything with it anymore. May as

82
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:03,500
well continue the franchise over at DC. I mean, I
was actually really surprised as to how much this

83
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:09,000
looked like Guardians of the Galaxy, considering
the fact it's not directed by James Gunn. It's

84
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,440
directed by Craig Gillespie, who also directed
films like I Tania and Corella, which I thought

85
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,440
were great movies. Well, it's just confusing me
because when I look at the Woman of Tomorrow comic,

86
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,880
it's a gorgeous looking book. It's very colorful,
very organic looking alien worlds, almost pastel

87
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:33,200
in its color palette. This is not that. These are
straight up reused Guardians of the Galaxy sets.

88
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,780
That wouldn't surprise me. I'm guessing the
director, maybe at the behest of James Gunn,

89
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:44,580
wanted to make it look more like a James Gunn movie
so that it looks like it fit more with the world that

90
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:52,140
the Superman movie established, as opposed to
looking more like the comic, which is very alien,

91
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,920
very organic, very colorful, like you mentioned.
Well, does that mean that every DCU project in live

92
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,200
action is going to have to look like James Gunn made
it? Like, is the upcoming Clayface movie going to

93
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:07,820
be like Slyther or something like that? Oh, dude, I
hope so. You just sold me on that. I guess I was the

94
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:14,880
wrong comparison. All in all, I think this was a
good teaser, not the best teaser I've ever seen by

95
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:21,900
any means. But it was enough, I think, to get people
excited. And honestly, I can't wait to see

96
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:28,080
people's reactions and theaters to this. Right
now, I only know my reaction and like my daughters.

97
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,280
They're excited. I'm excited. So when you say that
this teaser was enough to get people excited, are

98
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,200
you referring specifically to just you and your
daughters? Because I don't know anybody else

99
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,480
who's excited by this. Not even people on the
discord got excited by this. There was like zero

100
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:48,220
conversation about it. To be fair, I was in the
hospital the day this came out. So I would have been

101
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:55,500
talking about it a lot. Why are you giving us your
excuses? Because I was in pain in the ER. Again, why

102
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,820
are you giving us your excuses? Because I have them
to give. Well, you're out of the hospital within

103
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:06,320
like a day. So maybe you should be talking about
this on the discord. It's also been my daughter's

104
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:14,580
birthdays for the past two days. Oh, my God, so many
excuses. Yeah, bro. Yeah. You can't judge the

105
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:20,860
success of a trailer based on how many people are
talking about it in our own podcasts discord. I've

106
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:26,000
seen plenty of discussion online about it. Most of
it is good. Like I said, no one thinks this is the

107
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,060
greatest teaser trailer of all time, but it's
passable. All right. It's like a B minus. That's DC

108
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:37,400
for you. That's DC. I can't wait for the new
Avengers Doomsday teasers that are coming to

109
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,940
theaters. Apparently there's going to be four
different teasers and they're all going to be

110
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:46,580
attached in front of Avatar, Fire and Ash in
theaters. Are you serious? I did not know that. So

111
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,680
it looks like I'm going to go see Avatar four times
in theaters and hope I get to see each one. You're

112
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,900
going to have to go to like four different
theaters. I don't know, man. It's kind of

113
00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:02,100
bullshit. That reeks of desperation, I must say.
For Avatar. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I meant.

114
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,020
Yeah. I'll just wait till it's all online. Well,
we'll see if that happens. Maybe it'll be recorded

115
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,900
by somebody on their phone or something. Who
knows? It better be. When is Avengers coming out

116
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:17,600
next December? OK, well, I imagine the teaser for
that is going to be super, super short compared to

117
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:24,440
this one. Yeah. Of course, Supergirl again, comes
out next summer on June 26th. So look forward to our

118
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,120
review of it then. Right, because it'll come out
after this podcast ends, but we're still going to

119
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:40,540
be reviewing new films when they come out. That's
right. But that does it for all the news for this

120
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:44,900
episode. So let's go ahead and move into our main
event where we find out who would win in a fight

121
00:11:44,900 --> 00:12:05,520
between the Superman villain, Parasite and the
X-Men villain, Sauron. All right, Parasite

122
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,780
versus Sauron, these are both parasitic beings,
obviously. I mean, the guy's name is Parasite, but

123
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:16,420
in the sense that they absorb or siphon life energy
from their victims, it makes them stronger and

124
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,860
Sauron that manifests differently, I think, than
like someone like Rogue or Parasite, because

125
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:28,740
although Sauron can obtain the mutant powers of
people he siphons life energy from, largely, it

126
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:33,780
gives him the ability to like shoot out the energy
he absorbs in the form of like thermal energy,

127
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:39,160
which is pretty unique. Oh, like lasers? No, like
it looks more like electricity that comes from his

128
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,600
hands or fire from his mouth. Interesting. I did
not know that. Actually, I don't really know

129
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,040
anything about Sauron. He's a pretty dope
villain. Like out of all the characters from the

130
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,960
Savage Land that we could have gone with, I guess we
probably should have gone with Khazar or K-Zar,

131
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,700
however you want to pronounce it. But in the end,
I'm glad we went with Sauron, largely because what

132
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:03,560
defines the Savage Land are its dinosaurs, its
prehistoric life. And also, he's probably just

133
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,120
the biggest badass. That's like not human to come
out of there. Yeah, for a while we were considering

134
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:15,100
pitting Khazar or Khazar against either Warlord
or Commandy, which I think would have been cool.

135
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:19,940
That would have been cool. This is better. Yeah, if
we never did a Parasite duel in these 10 years, I

136
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:24,720
would have been really pissed off. We would have
failed as a podcast. Pretty much, pretty much. I

137
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,880
think there are many versions of Parasite that
have existed. So I'll be interested in seeing

138
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,280
which one you go with. It'll be Rudy Jones. He's the
primary one, I would say. Although, I'll go into

139
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:40,000
the backstory of a few others. OK. The movie
adaptation of this guy was very confusing, I have

140
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,860
to say. But also hella good, am I right? Before we
get into their backstories to explain the

141
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:51,820
methodology behind our duels, let's go to our
sentient duel simulator Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K

142
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:57,300
tell our listeners how you go about determining a
winner in our duel matchups. Yes, of course, sir.

143
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:01,300
The way I determine a winner between the
contestants is by running 1000 Monte Carlo

144
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:06,700
simulations using the characters statistics. A
Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic model

145
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,420
used to determine outcomes through random
sampling. In this case, I randomize the

146
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:16,360
statistics along a normal distribution as a way to
simulate the many variables that can occur during

147
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,300
battle. The stat parameters are based on the
official Marvel power grid from which the DC

148
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:25,960
characters statistics are extrapolated.
Additional stat categories are included such as

149
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,480
range, damage potential, versatility and
perception in order to create a more detailed and

150
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,840
accurate simulation. The results of the 1000
simulations provide a percentage of wins for each

151
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,420
character. The contestant with the higher
percentage is declared the victor as they have a

152
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,720
higher probability to win any given battle. In an
equitable pairing, neither character should win

153
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,060
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat

154
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:56,520
Superman. So the confidence rate of my method
falls in line with the precedents that have been

155
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,380
established in the source material. My
mathematical simulations are without

156
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:05,940
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole
consideration, nor a fan vote is tabulated for

157
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:11,680
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K.
Before we run the simulations, though, we like to

158
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,500
break down each character's histories and
abilities before improvising a scenario on how we

159
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,200
imagine one of the 1000 simulations would play out
beat for beat. And I believe it's my turn to go first

160
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,840
with the Marvel character backstory. So let me
tell you all about Sauron. Millions of years ago,

161
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,460
in the era of dinosaurs and the supercontinent
Pangea, an alien race called the New Wally

162
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:39,660
constructed a refuge for Earth's prehistoric
life in what is now Antarctica. When an asteroid

163
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:45,120
impact wiped out most of dinosaur life, this
preserve remained protected, allowing its

164
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,680
ancient species to survive unchanged. Over time,
shifting geological land masses and glaciation

165
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:58,240
formed an enormous crater that concealed what
came to be known as the Savageland. Spanning 350

166
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,120
square miles, its sheer icy walls isolated the
tropical basin from the frozen continent around

167
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,440
it, hiding the region for millennia, except
through secret tunnels, though pockets of early

168
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:16,000
man did stumble upon the Savageland, becoming its
native inhabitants. In modern times, Carl Lycos

169
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:22,400
was born the son of an explorer and spent his early
youth accompanying his father on expeditions. As

170
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,860
a teenager, he joined his father on a journey to
Tierra del Fuego, an archipelago at South

171
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:33,320
America's southernmost tip. There, they
assisted a wealthy client, Dr. Anderson and his

172
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,560
daughter, Tanya. During his expedition, Tanya
wandered into a cave and was attacked by mutant

173
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,920
pterodactyls that originated from the
prehistoric Savageland. Carl intervened,

174
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,880
driving the creatures off with his walking stick,
but in the struggle, he was bitten. Dr. Anderson

175
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:54,280
saved Carl's life, but the wound left him changed.
During his recovery, Carl discovered that he

176
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:59,500
could drain the life force of living beings
through touch, accidentally killing his dog. The

177
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,000
need for this life energy became persistent, and
in secret, he found himself periodically

178
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,579
compelled to extract it from animals to survive.
After Carl's father died shortly after the

179
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:15,819
expedition, Dr. Anderson took him into his home as
thanks for saving Tanya. Over the years, Carl and

180
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:21,060
Tanya grew close, but her father forbade a
relationship due to Carl's lack of wealth,

181
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:26,119
determined to win his approval. Carl pursued
medical training and became a physician,

182
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:31,620
geneticist and hypnotherapist. He treated
patients with hypnosis while secretly siphoning

183
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:37,160
their energy, rationalizing that he took only
enough to weaken, never to kill. During this

184
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:42,440
period, he collaborated with Professor Charles
Xavier, who became aware of Carl's condition, but

185
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,640
kept his secret. When Havoc was nearly killed
after losing control of his powers in a battle with

186
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,360
sentinels, the X-Men brought him to Carl's
Manhattan practice, believing him trustworthy

187
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:57,340
due to Xavier's association. You can learn more
about Havoc and the X-Men in their respective

188
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:02,960
duels against the Ray and the Titans. While
treating Havoc, Carl siphoned part of his life

189
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,720
force, but absorbing mutant energy triggered an
unprecedented transformation. He mutated into a

190
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:15,180
half humanoid pterodactyl with human
intelligence and powerful hypnotic abilities.

191
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:20,420
Shocked, he attacked the X-Men before escaping to
Dr. Anderson's home in an attempt to plead for

192
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:25,400
Tanya's hand in marriage. However, Tanya and her
father recognized Carl for the monster he had

193
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:31,600
become, forcing him to flee. Carl returned to
Tierra de Fuego, where horrified by his actions,

194
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,540
he attempted to starve himself to death. However,
Tanya pursued him, arriving with the X-Men close

195
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:42,820
behind. Carl felt the pull to drain Tanya's life
energy, but instead ran, falling over a cliff,

196
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:48,920
unable to locate him. Tanya and the X-Men presumed
Carl dead. However, he survived unconscious on a

197
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:54,460
ledge below and eventually wandered through
subterranean passages into the Savage Land.

198
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:59,920
There, he lived in human form by feeding only on
lesser animals, keeping his Sauron persona at

199
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:05,620
bay. He became an ally to the Jungle Lord, Khazar,
and provided medical care to his companions for

200
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:10,920
many months. When the X-Men later became stranded
in the Savage Land, the presence of mutant life

201
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:16,640
energy overwhelmed him, and he preyed on the team.
After absorbing Storm's energy, he reverted into

202
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,480
Sauron again, though he soon returned to human
form. After the X-Men departed, Magneto took an

203
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,540
interest in the Savage Land and began
experimenting on local inhabitants, creating a

204
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:33,060
mutated army to help him control the region.
However, his campaign was stopped by Khazar.

205
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:37,500
Tanya eventually learned Carl had survived the
fall and traveled to the Savage Land with

206
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:43,400
Archangel and Spider-Man. They found him, but the
Savage Land mutates captured them and used one of

207
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,520
Magneto's genetic transformers to mutate
Archangel, Spider-Man, and Tanya into

208
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:53,300
animalistic forms. When the machine was
destroyed, Carl drained their altered life

209
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:58,720
energies to restore them. The process worked, but
he involuntarily transformed into Sauron again

210
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,500
and joined the mutates in opposing the X-Men. The
X-Men defeated them and returned Carl to the

211
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:10,520
United States, where Professor Xavier appeared
to cure him. Carl and Tanya reunited, hoping to

212
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:16,700
build a normal life. The attempt ended when the
mutant Toad abducted Carl and Tanya in order to

213
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,740
recruit Sauron into his new Brotherhood of Evil
Mutants, whom you've learned more about in their

214
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:27,700
duel against the Flash Rogues. Toad forced Carl to
drain Tanya's life energy, killing her and

215
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:32,800
transforming Carl into Sauron once more.
Enraged, Sauron joined the Brotherhood and

216
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:38,300
helped them attack X-Force, Cable then shot
Sauron and discarded his body, though he

217
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:42,760
eventually recovered. He later battled
X-Factor, marking the beginning of several

218
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:48,120
renewed clashes with the X-Men. You can learn more
about Toad in his duel against the Trickster and

219
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,300
more about X-Force and X-Factor in their
respective duels against the Outsiders and the

220
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:58,300
Freedom Fighters. Sauron returned to the Savage
Land and took leadership of the Mutates. In one

221
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:03,940
effort to increase his power, he had them kidnap
Havoc, hoping to use his energy to sustain

222
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:09,340
himself. When Cyclops, Phoenix, and Polaris
attempted a rescue, Sauron placed both Summers

223
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:14,640
Brothers in an energy transfer device. The
combined energies mutated him further,

224
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,280
enlarging him and increasing his strength.
Phoenix confronted Carl on the psychic Astral

225
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:24,200
Plane, where his human consciousness seized
control and cast his Sauron persona into an

226
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,160
internal abyss. As a result, Sauron's physical
form became trapped in a feral, non-sentient

227
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:35,720
state. Sauron later recovered fragments of his
human mind and used this clarity to escape the

228
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:41,060
Savage Land by stowing away Ancazar's transport
to New York. He sought out the X-Men again, but was

229
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:46,540
defeated and turned over to Shield. Eventually,
he was incarcerated within the Weapon X program,

230
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:51,500
subjected to their experimentation, and forced
to capture and recruit other mutants, though the

231
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:57,580
program eventually collapsed. Carl was then held
in the superhuman prison called the Raft, where he

232
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:02,720
escaped during a jailbreak, prompting the
Avengers to pursue him back to the Savage Land.

233
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,800
After briefly holding the New Avengers team
hostage alongside the mutates, Sauron was shot in

234
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,600
the head by Black Widow. He survived by having
previously absorbed Wolverine's healing

235
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,920
factor. During the Skrull's secret invasion of
Earth and their infiltration of the Savage Land,

236
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:23,440
Sauron fought the Skrulls alongside Khazar, his
wife Shanna, their pet Sabertooth Tiger Zabu, and

237
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,480
the native tribes. Sauron later appeared at a
gathering of Wolverine's enemies, hosted by

238
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,680
Sabertooth, where Wolverine fought and defeated
the assembled villains. Sauron then joined the

239
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:39,020
Hellfire Club's new school, the Hellfire
Academy, as a staff member, serving as the

240
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:44,100
school's science instructor. Sauron eventually
partnered with Dr. Vincent Stegron, a former

241
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:50,000
Shield scientist who experimented with dinosaur
DNA recovered from the Savage Land. Together,

242
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,380
they plan to transform humanity into dinosaurs,
battling Spiderman and students from the Jean

243
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:00,260
Grey School. Their alliance crumbled due to
jealousy over their infatuation with the student

244
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:05,380
Shark Girl, leading to an internal conflict that
caused their powers to cancel out, petrifying

245
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:11,540
both. Later, Carl resumed laboratory work to
enhance control over his transformations. Now

246
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:17,780
able to store mutant energy, he transformed into
Sauron at will and confronted the Scarlet Spider,

247
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:22,980
a clone of Spiderman before being defeated and
restrained for authorities. However, he escaped

248
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:28,860
and maintained a lab in Staten Island, helping
defend it against Null, a dark primordial deity

249
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:33,480
you can learn more about in his duel with White
Lantern. Joining his fellow mutants on the

250
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,020
Sentient Island nation of Krakowa, Carl then
joined the team X-Men Green, which took an

251
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:44,400
environmentalist stance, fighting on behalf of
planet Earth. After the fall of Krakowa, Carl

252
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,800
returned to the Savage Land, where he was later
imprisoned by Khazar. And that's his backstory.

253
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:55,880
Powers-wise, Sauron is a mutate with the ability
to drain life energy or any thermal energy source

254
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,860
directed at him through touch contact.
Initially, the energy would involuntarily

255
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:06,340
transform Carl into a pterodactyl form, though
through his medical and genetics expertise, he

256
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:11,520
developed the ability to transform at will by
storing the energy in his cells. With his

257
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,420
pterodactyl physiology, he gains enhanced
strength, able to lift around 10 tons,

258
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:22,800
durability, and flight. He has a beak full of sharp
teeth along with talons on his hands and feet.

259
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:28,200
Siphoning a victim's life energy leaves them
feeling drained, and Sauron can expel excess

260
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:33,960
energy from his mouth via fire breathing or energy
emissions through his hands. With his eyes,

261
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:39,100
Sauron can hypnotize victims to induce
hallucinations. When he drains mutants, he

262
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:44,780
absorbs their mutant powers temporarily, though
to a lesser extent than rogue. If he runs out of

263
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:49,960
energy, he will revert back to his human form. The
extent of his intelligence while in pterodactyl

264
00:24:49,960 --> 00:25:04,310
mode varies. He typically retains his intellect
as Sauron Okay, so he is a little bit more going for

265
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:11,170
him than I initially thought. Good. I also forgot
that he had a human form. I thought he was just full

266
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:17,470
pterodactyl all the time. Nope. Initially, he was
supposed to be like a bat creature, but they

267
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,610
couldn't get that past the comics code authority
because that would have been too vampire like. So

268
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:27,230
the writers turned him into a pterodactyl, which
in turn influenced the entire savage land to be a

269
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:31,730
prehistoric refuge. Interesting. Well, that
sounds like it would have been too close to Morbius

270
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:36,590
anyway. Right, exactly. Well, now that we've
heard about Sauron, let's get to the character

271
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:43,650
everyone's here for. Parasite. The earliest
individual to bear the name Parasite was Raymond

272
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:49,370
Maxwell Jensen, a laborer whose exposure to
radioactive material at a research facility

273
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:55,610
mutated his body into a parasitic organism
capable of absorbing life energy, memories, and

274
00:25:55,610 --> 00:26:00,770
powers through physical contact. Jensen
repeatedly confronted Superman, draining

275
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:06,250
portions of Kryptonian power before his body
destabilized and disintegrated. Though

276
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:11,990
believed destroyed multiple times, Jensen's
cells repeatedly reconstituted, establishing

277
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:18,690
that a human body could persist as a living energy
absorbing entity. Years later, a new incarnation

278
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:26,090
emerged in Rudolph Rudy Jones, a janitor employed
at the Pittsburgh branch of Star Labs. Believing

279
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:32,010
valuable materials were hidden within secured
waste containers, Rudy forced one open and was

280
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:38,150
exposed to experimental radiation. The accident
transformed him into a bald, green-skinned

281
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:43,890
mutant whose body could no longer sustain itself
naturally. Rudy discovered that he had to drain

282
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:49,630
life energy directly from other beings in order to
survive, leaving victims as burned-out

283
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:56,610
skeletons. Unlike Jensen, Rudy's hunger was
constant and unavoidable, and without feeding,

284
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:02,530
his body rapidly deteriorated. Rudy fled
confinement and became known as Parasite,

285
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:08,390
quickly drawing the attention of Superman after
draining multiple victims. When Parasite made

286
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:14,190
contact with Superman, he absorbed Kryptonian
energy on a massive scale, gaining superhuman

287
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:19,970
strength, durability, and heightened
intelligence. As the stolen energy dissipated,

288
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:25,630
Parasite weakened again, driving him to
repeatedly seek out Superman as his most potent

289
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:31,130
source of sustenance. Parasite's earliest
confrontations with Superman were erratic and

290
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:37,370
driven by immediate hunger. He was repeatedly
captured and incarcerated, only to escape as his

291
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:43,110
absorption abilities weakened power systems and
guards alike. Attempts to stabilize or cure his

292
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:48,610
condition failed, instead altering his
physiology. Medical interventions changed his

293
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:54,570
skin color from green to purple, and expanded his
absorption capabilities to include non-living

294
00:27:54,570 --> 00:28:01,310
energy sources such as electricity and heat.
During a volatile standoff involving Firestorm,

295
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:06,570
Parasite was deployed despite objections from
those overseeing the operation. Once released,

296
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:11,510
he immediately lost control, feeding
indiscriminately and endangering multiple

297
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:16,930
combatants. When he attacked Firestorm
directly, the disparity in power left Parasite

298
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:22,770
severely injured and near death, though subdued,
Parasite later exhibited further psychological

299
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:28,090
changes. Parasite's fixation on Superman
intensified during a crisis in which Superman

300
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:34,110
struggled to contain an overload of solar energy.
The confrontation carried both beyond Earth,

301
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:40,130
where Superman released a massive burst of heat
vision. Parasite absorbed the blast entirely,

302
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:45,770
triggering a violent mutation that increased his
size and strength. In this state, he could drain

303
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:51,330
inertia from moving objects and siphon energy
through mental contact, making telepathic

304
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:56,810
attacks ineffective. The transformation also
increased his metabolic demands, forcing more

305
00:28:56,810 --> 00:29:02,490
frequent feeding. While imprisoned afterward,
Parasite absorbed a scientist tending to him,

306
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:07,170
though he was not consumed completely, and
instead the mind of Dr. Torval Freeman remained

307
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:13,370
within Parasite, significantly increasing his
intelligence. From that point forward, Parasite

308
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:19,790
employed more calculated tactics, relying less
on uncontrolled rampage and more on planning and

309
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:25,150
deception. Parasite later aligned himself with
other adversaries targeting Superman,

310
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:29,470
repeatedly testing how his absorption
interacted with altered forms of Kryptonian

311
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:35,690
power. In one encounter, Superman's unstable
energy nearly killed Parasite. In another,

312
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:40,790
Parasite attempted to feed on Supergirl and was
defeated. These encounters informed Parasite's

313
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:46,070
subsequent tactics and feeding strategies. A
significant change occurred when Parasite was

314
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:51,550
contracted to drain excess electromagnetic
energy from an electrical being known as Strange

315
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:57,350
Visitor. Exposure to this energy altered
Parasite permanently, allowing him to retain

316
00:29:57,350 --> 00:30:03,050
absorbed intellects and hold stolen power for
extended periods. Later, he absorbed a

317
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:08,230
shapeshifter, getting the ability to replicate
victims perfectly at the genetic level,

318
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:13,710
including voice, appearance, and biological
traits. With these abilities, Parasite shifted

319
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:19,390
tactics. He stalked Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen,
seeking leverage over Superman rather than

320
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:25,050
immediate power. By posing as an elderly civilian
and engineering brief physical contact with

321
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:31,310
Lois, Parasite confirmed Superman's secret
identity. He abducted Lois and replaced her,

322
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:36,630
maintaining the impersonation through repeated
contact. During this period, Parasite provoked

323
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:42,430
confrontations with Clark Kent and later struck
Superman while still disguised as Lois,

324
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:48,370
revealing the deception. The scheme ended during
a physical assault on Superman. Over time,

325
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:53,950
Parasite had unknowingly absorbed Kryptonite
radiation present in Superman's system. The

326
00:30:53,950 --> 00:31:00,090
accumulated poisoning overwhelmed him, made
flights, paralyzing, and killing him before he

327
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:05,970
could disclose Lois' location. Superman later
recovered Lois from Parasite's hideout. Despite

328
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:11,610
his apparent death, Parasite later resurfaced in
St. Rock, Louisiana. There, he used his abilities

329
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:16,710
to temporarily drain other villains of their
powers in exchange for payment, allowing them to

330
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:21,210
evade detection. Though his appearance and
speech differed noticeably from earlier

331
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:27,270
encounters, he was confirmed to be Rudy Jones,
having regenerated from his apparent death.

332
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:33,250
After the Flashpoint event reset continuity, a
new Parasite emerged in the form of Joshua Michael

333
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:38,950
Allen, a courier living in Metropolis. Allen's
transformation began when he attacked a

334
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:44,030
Parasitic creature during a battle,
electrocuting both it and himself. Though he

335
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:50,010
survived, his body deteriorated rapidly. While
undergoing examination at Star Labs, an

336
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:55,490
explosion killed the attending scientists and
transformed Allen into a skeletal, hairless

337
00:31:55,490 --> 00:32:00,550
organism that drained life energy
uncontrollably. Unable to endure the constant

338
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:05,950
hunger, Allen attempted suicide, but Superman
intervened. Contact with Superman temporarily

339
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:12,330
relieved his pain, initiating an obsession with
metahuman energy. Allen was imprisoned and later

340
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:17,670
aligned with criminal groups to gain access to
stronger power sources. His abilities evolved,

341
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:23,010
allowing power replication with minimal contact
and size increase, proportional to absorbed

342
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:28,970
energy. Rudolph Rudy Jones later reappeared as
Parasite in this continuity, demonstrating

343
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:34,590
greater caution than in earlier incarnations and
refusing to absorb energies he believed would

344
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:40,010
destroy him. He was forcibly recruited into
suicide squad operations and deployed on a

345
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:45,810
mission to capture the new Swamp Thing, during
which he fed on the green and was violently purged

346
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:51,250
of the stolen energy, leaving him mutilated and
abandoned. Jones later returned under

347
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:55,910
supervision, equipped with a device that
regulated his hunger and allowed limited

348
00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:01,230
employment. He assisted Superman during major
threats and was seemingly killed while fighting

349
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:07,530
Doomsday, surviving by absorbing residual
energy. His most unstable mutation allowed him to

350
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:12,590
divide into autonomous duplicates capable of
infecting other beings, increasing his threat

351
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:18,650
level while also accelerating his physical
collapse. And that's Parasites. Powers-wise,

352
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:24,350
Parasite absorbs life energy, memories, skills,
and superhuman abilities through physical

353
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:31,510
contact and can train non-living energy sources
such as electricity, heat, and solar radiation.

354
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:37,190
Absorbed power temporarily enhances his
strength, durability, size, and intellect

355
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:43,070
before dissipating, requiring continual
feeding. He can perfectly mimic victims down to

356
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:49,010
their DNA and regenerate. Later incarnations
could also divide into duplicates, though he

357
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:53,570
inherits the weakness of those he drains,
including vulnerability to kryptonite when

358
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:59,490
absorbing kryptonian energy and excessive
absorption destabilizes his body. That's

359
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:04,170
Parasite. Why didn't I know that he has
shapeshifting abilities? He didn't always have

360
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:10,670
them. He only attained them because he absorbed a
shapeshifter for a time. But does he consistently

361
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:17,730
have shapeshifting abilities now? Maybe. Okay,
fucking dumb. It is unique that he's actually one

362
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:23,590
of the few energy absorbers that can shapeshift.
Like, Rogue can't do that. Well, no, his whole body

363
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:30,870
is just weird, though. He's almost like Clayface
in a way in a few iterations where he's just like

364
00:34:30,870 --> 00:34:35,850
this amorphous blob almost. Can you describe the
version you're going with for this match a little

365
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:42,030
bit better? Yeah, sure. I mean, he's going to start
off in like a normal humanoid-ish size and

366
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:47,670
physique, but of course purple in color. Okay. All
right, that works for me. I don't think we've ever

367
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:52,050
put two energy absorbers against each other. Like
the most recent match we did was with Sebastian

368
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:58,310
Shaw, but that was against Mandel Savage, and of
course we've done Rogue and Superboy. So I have no

369
00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:04,290
idea how this is going to end, but let's find out.
Did we think this battle through enough? Like,

370
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:08,670
they're both energy absorbers. What are they
going to absorb from each other? The ability to

371
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:34,030
absorb energy? It's like pooping back and forth
forever. I don't know if you like it. Podcast

383
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,410
got the characters, histories, and abilities out
of the way, let's speculate on how one of the 1000

384
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:59,710
simulated matches will go. The winners
determined by simulations, not the speculation,

385
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:05,310
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could play
out. AG9K, what are the rules of our speculation?

386
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:10,070
Well I should say there are no rules, other than the
characters have no prior knowledge of the other

387
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:14,810
going into the fight. All they are aware of
starting out is that the other character is a

388
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:19,190
threat that needs to be eliminated. For the
speculation, the contestants will begin

389
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:24,570
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript
environment that will have no bearing on the match

390
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:29,470
itself, as no environmental statistics are
considered in my simulations. The contestants

391
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:35,490
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright
then, let's get into it. Parasite and Sauron meet

392
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:42,030
on the battlefield? Who goes first? I'm actually
guessing Parasite might go first, because at his

393
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:50,130
base level, he's probably not as intelligent or as
calculating as Sauron is. Basically, Parasite,

394
00:37:50,130 --> 00:37:56,770
he's just gonna be hungry, so he is going to lunge
for Sauron, grabbing one of his wings, and

395
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:01,950
draining his life energy, as well as his
intellect. You think that Parasite can cover that

396
00:38:01,950 --> 00:38:06,910
distance of 50 meters between them before Sauron
takes to the sky? I don't think that's gonna

397
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:12,590
happen. Parasite's not gonna be able to touch
Sauron, and while Sauron's looking down on

398
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:19,270
Parasite from the air, he's gonna use his gaze to
hypnotize Parasite into a trance that keeps him

399
00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:26,670
still. And with Parasite just standing there,
Sauron's gonna land down behind him and grab his

400
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:32,330
skull with both hands and just drain his life
energy. Well, I mean, Sauron's physical contact

401
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:39,770
would actually allow Parasite to drain him as
well, though. And this match is over. They just

402
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:44,670
both drain each other to death forever,
apparently. Well, I mean, I imagine there would be

403
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:51,810
some kind of energy feedback loop that would
probably cause both of them to overload and be

404
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:57,810
violently repelled from each other, like an
explosive force. So now Parasite is like 15 feet

405
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:05,990
tall, inject with a huge mouth of razor sharp teeth
and wings. That doesn't sound right to me. I don't

406
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:10,950
actually think Parasite would gain any benefit
from absorption if that energy is just going back

407
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:16,390
and forth between him and Sauron. My guess is that
they wouldn't overload by touching each other,

408
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:19,830
because where would that excess energy come from?
Like, they're absorbers, they're not

409
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:26,030
generators. I think that it would actually be a net
energy gain for each side, like nothing would

410
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:31,590
happen. So absorption alone probably wouldn't be
a factor in this match. They'd have to resort to

411
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:37,850
other abilities. But I mean, Parasite gets larger
by absorbing any energy. Like maybe he wouldn't

412
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:43,690
get the wings or any of Sauron's unique abilities,
but the energy moving through him, I think, would

413
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:49,810
make him smarter and stronger. What? Why? Like,
you don't get any energy that Parasite absorbs

414
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:58,770
would be taken from him via Sauron's absorption.
Okay. Okay. So how would Sauron defeat Parasite

415
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:05,950
then? Easy. Sauron rips Parasite's face off with
his claws, obviously. Okay. So you mean he

416
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:11,470
physically touches him? Awesome. With each
slash, Parasite is just going to get stronger. But

417
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:17,810
Sauron would also get stronger with each slash
two. You know what, we got to find a way for them to

418
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:23,750
actually absorb each other. That's the only way
this is going to work. But we'll say that the one who

419
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:29,970
is absorbing is the one who initiated the contact.
So they can't touch each other. The one who's doing

420
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:34,910
the strike is the one that absorbs. Does that make
sense? How about that? So we'll go back to the

421
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:39,870
initial narrative where Sauron takes to the air
hypnotizes Parasite into submission and then

422
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:44,470
lands behind him and then drains him with his
claws. So this is going to leave Parasite weakened

423
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:50,090
because he's not going to be absorbing from
Sauron's touch. And then Sauron is just going to

424
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:56,370
fry Parasite to a crisp with his flame breath,
finishing him off. Okay. So Parasite will just

425
00:40:56,370 --> 00:41:03,270
absorb the thermal energy from the flame. And
that's going to restore him probably beyond what

426
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:09,690
he started out as because I'm going to say Sauron
emitted much more energy than he drained. What? So

427
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:17,310
now Parasite is, we'll say he's like eight foot
jacked monster who uses his longer reach to grab

428
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:23,290
Sauron by the wrists, draining his energy because
he's the one who initiated the contact while also

429
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:30,090
spreading Sauron's arms apart until they pop from
the sockets. All right. But while Parasite is

430
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:35,390
holding Sauron's arms out, he's going to kick his
legs forward and snatch Parasite by the chest with

431
00:41:35,390 --> 00:41:41,370
his talons. And he's going to start draining back
the energy that Parasite stole from him. That's

432
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:48,410
going to cause Parasite to let go of Sauron's
wrists. So Parasite loses energy. He shrinks down

433
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:58,210
in withers. He's sees what the game is here. He's
going to put some distance between them. So he's

434
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:03,330
going to fly like 50, 100 yards away. And he's just
going to start tearing up the environment below

435
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:08,710
him, like slashing out the ground, tearing it up
into like small chunks of earth. You know, he's

436
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:13,310
could lift 10 tons. He's strong enough, but he's
going to pick up some of these chunks and then fly

437
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:18,790
into the air and then just start dropping and
pelting Parasite with the stones, basically

438
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:24,010
stoning him to death because he knows he has to keep
his distance and Parasite can't do anything Okay,

439
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:31,170
except in the brief moment Parasite held Sauron,
he caught glimpses of some of Sauron's memories,

440
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:37,350
particularly of Tanya. So with the last amount of
his energy, Parasite is going to transform it to

441
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:42,030
her. And that's going to trick Sauron's
animalistic brain and prevent him from attacking

442
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:47,670
her with the stones. And when Sauron flies down to
meet her, that's when Parasite is just going to

443
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:53,590
grab him by the throat and drain him. And he's going
to gain wings in the process. So he flies up to the

444
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:59,490
sky holding Sauron by the neck. And when Sauron
becomes so drained that he reverts back to human

445
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:06,930
form, that's when Parasite is going to drop him,
causing Carl to fall to his death. Match over. That

446
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:13,990
was a pretty solid move. But I'm going to say that
right before turning back into Carl, Sauron with

447
00:43:13,990 --> 00:43:17,810
the last of his strength just rips out Parasites
throughout with his beak while they're flying in

448
00:43:17,810 --> 00:43:25,730
the air. So Parasite, you know, he's in pain. He
drops Sauron who glides safely to the ground, but

449
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:31,110
Parasite crashes down and then bleeds out. Wait,
so you're saying that Sauron did that with the last

450
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:39,130
of his energy? So he still reverts to human form and
still fell when Parasite let go? I'll allow this. I

451
00:43:39,130 --> 00:43:43,510
didn't mean it was like the last last of his energy.
I mean, he still had some in the tank, you know, he

452
00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:48,530
was running on fumes, basically. But he could
still do it. Parasite could use some of his stored

453
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:54,830
energy to actually regenerate. You know, he's
come back from death that way several times. Yep.

454
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:59,730
But the key phrase there of what you just said is
that he died, meaning Sauron wins, meaning match

455
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:05,590
over. No, because I mean, what really happened is
that he dropped Carl. So, well, we'll leave the

456
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:11,770
match there. This was a tricky one. Either
Parasite absorbed so much of Sauron's energy

457
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:17,630
while flying up in the air that he causes Sauron to
revert back to Carl and then drop some down to the

458
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:23,870
ground, or Sauron, before reverting back into
human, rips out Parasite's throat and Parasite

459
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:29,930
dies that way. Not likely. We'll go ahead and input
the character stats, run the simulations, and

460
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:36,370
come back with a winner. AJ9K hit it. Inputting
data, running calculations, processing

461
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:41,610
results, simulations complete. All right, whose
idea was this matchup? Was it yours, Jonathan?

462
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:47,770
Because I feel like it was one of yours. It may have
been mine, and I think I'm realizing why now we kept

463
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:54,650
pushing this match off. This was not easy
considering Parasite's stats are so fluid and

464
00:44:54,650 --> 00:45:00,210
variable. Yeah, really, Parasite is only as good
as the character he's going up against. When he

465
00:45:00,210 --> 00:45:05,070
goes up against huge powerhouses like Superman,
his stats are off the charts. But when he's going up

466
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:09,610
against someone like mid-level, I would describe
Sauron as, you know, Parasite stats are

467
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:16,050
mid-level. That being said, you can never know at
what given time what Parasite's stats are,

468
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:20,450
because it's all based on how much energy he's
absorbed from his opponent. Basically, what

469
00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:26,670
we've done energy absorbers in the past, like
Rogue or Sebastian Shaw, will average their stats

470
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:33,070
between their base level and their potential. So
that's what we did here. Now, Parasite has some

471
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:39,210
pretty impressive feats in the comics, but
considering that Sauron is not as powerful, like

472
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:45,270
you mentioned, as Superman or someone even like
Firestorm, and on top of that, basically has the

473
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:52,550
same abilities as Parasite in terms of
absorption, this didn't really go in my favor, I

474
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:58,090
feel like. Well, Parasite really had one main
thing going for him over Sauron, and I believe that

475
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:05,370
was durability. Yeah, base level durability for
Parasite is fairly high. But Sauron, you know, he

476
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:11,170
had the intellect thing going for him. He had the
versatility because not only can he, you know,

477
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:15,590
slash you with his talons, burn you with his
fireballs or shoot you with energy or hypnotize

478
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:21,190
you, he has like all this shit going for him outside
of just the power of absorption. Whereas Parasite

479
00:46:21,190 --> 00:46:26,610
doesn't, he has to actually absorb the ability
before he has it. So with all that said, Jonathan,

480
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:31,570
who do you think is winning this match? Well, let's
see, I'm hopeful. Just as our Instagram followers

481
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:39,170
are, 62% of them voted in favor of Parasite in the
poll that we put up on Instagram. Well, I think a lot

482
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:44,730
of those poll takers are probably considering the
fact that Parasite is a Superman villain, so

483
00:46:44,730 --> 00:46:50,650
they're putting him at Superman levels without
actually considering exactly how his powers work

484
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:56,990
in any singular matchup. But let's see if I'm
right. AJ9K, the results please. Here you are,

485
00:46:56,990 --> 00:47:07,470
sir. Alright, the winner between Parasite and
Sauron is Sauron. There's only one Lord of the

486
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:13,410
Rings and he does not share power, not even with
Parasite. Because out of the 1000 matches that

487
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:24,830
they fought, Sauron won a whopping 662, damn,
whereas Parasite only won 338, so 66.2% over

488
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:33,650
33.8%. I'm not surprised by this, I'm hurt for
sure, but not surprised. Although I feel like a lot

489
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:39,690
of people will be. Yeah, well, really Jonathan,
what you needed to do was have Parasite go up in a

490
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:45,950
match with Superman and drain all of his energy and
then go into this match with Sauron where he would

491
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:50,750
have just wiped the floor with the dinosaur. But
since that is not really something that we do in

492
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:58,070
this podcast, yeah, Parasite just basically ate
ass. Did you say he ate ass? Or ate shit? That's what

493
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:04,070
I meant to say. Ew, so you're saying Parasite ate
Sauron's ass? Oh my god, get over it, you're so

494
00:48:04,070 --> 00:48:08,350
obsessed with this, just move on. I already know
you're running visuals in your head and

495
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:16,010
everything. Well, let's leave it on that note.
That'll do it for this duel. AJ9K, help close this
