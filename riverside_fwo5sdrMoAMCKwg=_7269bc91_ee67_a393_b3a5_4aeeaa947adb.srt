16
00:01:56,922 --> 00:02:01,966
Hi, welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

17
00:02:01,986 --> 00:02:07,511
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters and stat-based battle simulations.

18
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:16,078
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother Marvelous
Joe. And welcome to episode 254! We're doing

19
00:02:16,098 --> 00:02:20,862
a team duel this episode. We're going to pit
the Justice League Dark against Marvel's Midnight

20
00:02:20,922 --> 00:02:26,790
Suns. We wanted to do this on episode 250. But
of course, we've had to do quite a few reviews

21
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,932
lately, and that pushed our big team duel episode
back by a month. Yeah, we were trying to get

22
00:02:31,972 --> 00:02:35,774
to this before Halloween, but it just didn't
work out that way. But this team duel episode

23
00:02:35,854 --> 00:02:39,856
ties into Halloween in that these teams that
were pitting against each other are Marvel

24
00:02:39,876 --> 00:02:44,818
and DC's respective supernatural teams. These
are the guys that fight the things that go

25
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:49,620
bump in the night, the monsters, the demons,
the ghosts, the things like that. Yeah, I love

26
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,838
doing these team duels. Can't wait for the main
event later on in the episode. Before that,

27
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:57,719
we're going to break down the comic book and
movie news items from the past week, of which

28
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:03,142
it's all Marvel news once again, thanks to Disney
Plus Day, in which they gave us our first looks

29
00:03:03,222 --> 00:03:08,564

lot more. As always, we list our segment times

40
00:04:03,454 --> 00:04:08,517
notes. I want to quickly reach out to one of
our executive producers who happens to be sick

41
00:04:08,537 --> 00:04:12,480
with COVID at this time. Guys, stay safe out
there. We're definitely not out of this COVID

42
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,743
thing yet. Get vaccinated if you can and well
wishes to anyone who is currently sick out

43
00:04:16,763 --> 00:04:21,118
there. Yeah, man, if you're listening, get well
soon. We're rooting for you. We also want to

44
00:04:21,138 --> 00:04:25,700
give a shout out to patron Lizzie Dyer, whose
birthday was a few days ago. Happy birthday.

45
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,862
If I had to give you a gift from Marvel, I would
give you Hawkeye's quiver of trick arrows,

46
00:04:31,242 --> 00:04:37,504
including, you know, his birthday candle lighting
arrows, which you know he totally has. Like

47
00:04:37,524 --> 00:04:42,006
a lighter arrow? Yeah, yeah. He just, you know,
shoots across the wicks and it lights everything.

48
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:47,548
Interesting. Lizzie, if I could get you a gift
from DC, it would be Big Barter's Mega Rod.

49
00:04:48,009 --> 00:04:52,511
Way cooler than a bag of arrows. Well, I mean,
if she doesn't like the gift, there's no receipt.

50
00:04:53,092 --> 00:05:00,097
So, whatever. But with that out of the way,
quick, to the No Prize! A No Prize is an award

51
00:05:00,177 --> 00:05:05,060
Marvel used to give out up until the 90s to
fans. Our version, the dynamic dual No Prize,

52
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:10,104
is a digital award we post on social media that
Jonathan draws for those who we feel gave the

53
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:15,267
best answer to our Question of the Week. Last
week's question coming off the news that Marvel

54
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:21,129
is going to do a Halloween special in 2022 based
on the werewolf by night character, we asked,

55
00:05:21,309 --> 00:05:25,511
what's a cool Marvel or DC holiday special that
you would like to see? We got some awesome

56
00:05:25,571 --> 00:05:28,992
answers for this one. Let's go ahead and run
down our honorable mentions as well as the

57
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:34,454
no prize winner. Our first honorable mention
goes to Michael Haggerty, who said, hello boys,

58
00:05:34,494 --> 00:05:39,617
Michael Haggerty here. I want to see a Justice
League Dark Christmas Carol with Constantine

59
00:05:39,697 --> 00:05:44,175
or Constantine based on your regional preference.
As Ebenezer Scrooge, there's already ghosts

60
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:47,617
in Just League Dark and there's ghosts in Christmas
Carol. So it kind of matches up perfectly.

61
00:05:48,038 --> 00:05:53,221
The only question left is who would be little
Timmy? Who would be God bless us everyone?

62
00:05:53,642 --> 00:05:57,004
What character would play that character? I
think that's the bigger question, but that's

63
00:05:57,044 --> 00:06:01,787
my answer. All right, boys, gotta go, bye. A
Christmas Carol featuring John Constantine

64
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:06,411
is probably one of the most brilliant ideas
I've ever heard come out of a question of the

65
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:12,855
week. John Constantine is totally like a selfish
Scrooge. So for him to be visited by the ghosts

66
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:18,500
from his past totally makes sense. And as for
the Timmy character, that's obvious. Astralogue,

67
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,203
the little girl he tried and failed to save
at Newcastle from the demon Nurgall. Oh my

68
00:06:23,223 --> 00:06:28,308
gosh dude, Michael Haggerty, you blew my mind.
I think a better Tiny Tim would be Damien Wayne,

69
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:34,072
Robin. That is a terrible idea. Why? Because
Constantine trying to save Astralogue in the

70
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:40,097
same way that Scrooge tries to save Tiny Tim
just writes itself. What about like Snapper

71
00:06:40,137 --> 00:06:45,247
Car? Get the fuck out of here. That's rude,
you're like a screwed yourself. This story

72
00:06:45,307 --> 00:06:50,348
needs to happen, I swear. Our next honorable
mention goes to Miggy Mathenkean, who said.

73
00:06:50,888 --> 00:06:54,949
Hey, what's up guys, it's Miggy, and I would
love to see a Cinco de Mayo DC holiday special.

74
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:59,471
I think it would just be really dope to see
Jaime Reyes, Jessica Cruz, and Cisco Ramon

75
00:06:59,491 --> 00:07:04,472
just like all, you know, get together, just
celebrate the holiday, and then maybe have

76
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:09,413
to team up against like Bain. Now to my knowledge,
they don't actually celebrate Cinco de Mayo

77
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:15,462
in Mexico. Yeah, it's much more celebrated in
America. But, you know, Cisco, Jaime, and Jessica

78
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:20,846
are all, you know, Latin American. So I think
it works. Are they all Mexican American? Well,

79
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:27,111
Blue Beetle is Mexican American. Cisco, I think,
is Puerto Rican. And I guess Jessica is half

80
00:07:27,151 --> 00:07:32,996
Mexican, half Honduran. And of course, Bain
is from a Latin Caribbean country, right? Like

81
00:07:33,016 --> 00:07:37,540
a riff on Cuba. Yeah, Santa Prisca. But you
know what? They still come together to celebrate.

82
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,742
Yeah, it's kind of just like a drinking holiday,
right? It's like... It's like St. Patrick's

83
00:07:40,782 --> 00:07:44,543
Day, just an excuse to drink. It'd be cool if
they all got drunk and then tried to fight

84
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:49,104
Bane, who was also drunk. And then they all
come together to recognize the official meaning

85
00:07:49,144 --> 00:07:53,245
of the holiday, which was the Mexican defeat
over the French on the 5th of May. Yep, there

86
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:58,987
you go. Our final honorable mention goes to
Michael Harald, who said, Hey guys, it's Michael

87
00:07:59,027 --> 00:08:03,868
Harald. So I think the holiday special I'd like
to see would be Lego Batman in live action

88
00:08:04,188 --> 00:08:08,129
with a Will Arnett and all them doing Mother's
Day and Father's Day to see them hamming it

89
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:13,813
up over not having his parents. or really just
any holiday. I think that could be pretty funny.

90
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:18,396
Yeah, maybe live action can work. I still love
Lego Batman in his animated form. I really

91
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:22,079
wish they would make a sequel to the first movie
because I really liked it. Well, Lego Batman

92
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:26,342
is pretty funny. I'll admit that I've always
wanted to see Will Arnett, who does the voice

93
00:08:26,362 --> 00:08:30,946
for Lego Batman, dressed up in the bat suit
and do his shtick in live action. I think that

94
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:35,349
would be pretty cool to see. And considering
that Batman has no parents, it would be interesting

95
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:39,843
to see. him do a holiday special on Mother's
Day or Father's Day. Or in the case of Lego

96
00:08:39,863 --> 00:08:44,725
Batman, who prefers to be called Padre, Padre's
Day. I think it would definitely build upon

97
00:08:44,765 --> 00:08:49,507
the movie where we see Batman take Robin on
as a father. So you know, you can learn about

98
00:08:49,547 --> 00:08:53,529
the true meaning of fatherhood. Before we announce
the winner of this week's No Prize, we want

99
00:08:53,549 --> 00:08:57,971
to give a quick shout out to Corey Wooten, who
took the time to visit our site and record

100
00:08:57,991 --> 00:09:02,633
an answer. Yeah, his answer of Santa Claus was
really good also. But the winner of this week's

101
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:10,151
No Prize... goes to someone who only identified
themselves as the man who said, Hello Marvelous

102
00:09:10,211 --> 00:09:17,136
Joe and Johnny DC. Stan Lee here. How about
we get a holiday special featuring yours truly?

103
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:24,843
Just an idea. Thank you, true believers for
keeping the spirit of Marvel strong. Excelsior.

104
00:09:25,803 --> 00:09:30,748
That impression, if it was an impression that
wasn't actually just Stan Lee speaking to us

105
00:09:30,768 --> 00:09:35,594
from beyond the grave, that was so good. That
was incredible. I don't even understand how

106
00:09:35,634 --> 00:09:41,276
an impression is possibly that good. It sounded
just like him. Not only did it sound like him

107
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:47,797
with like the cadence and everything, it sounded
like what Stan Lee would actually say. I'm

108
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:52,219
just blown away by this impression, and that's
why he gets this week's no prize. But also,

109
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:58,120
it would be really cool to see a Stan Lee holiday
special where he celebrates just any holiday

110
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:03,566
visiting his favorite creations from Marvel.
I've got chills. It's so spot on. There's got

111
00:10:03,586 --> 00:10:07,987
to be like only a few people in the world that
can do an impression that good. If this guy

112
00:10:08,007 --> 00:10:12,849
is not getting paid to do Stanley impressions,
he should be. Because my first impression to

113
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:18,412
hearing that was actually fright. You know,
I was like, oh my God, that was actually him.

114
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:24,034
And I really want to believe that it is. Well,
you know, maybe that reaction is appropriate

115
00:10:24,094 --> 00:10:28,536
for this Halloween themed duel we have coming
up. You know, what's interesting, though, is

116
00:10:28,576 --> 00:10:34,226
that Stanley actually died three years almost
to the day. so this episode is being done on

117
00:10:34,246 --> 00:10:38,588
the anniversary of his passing. But congrats
again to The Man for winning this week's No

118
00:10:38,628 --> 00:10:43,451
Prize. If you the listener want a shot at winning
your own No Prize, stay tuned to later on this

119
00:10:43,491 --> 00:10:48,573
episode when we'll be asking another Question
of the Week. And now that that's done, on to

120
00:10:48,593 --> 00:10:49,233
the news!

121
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,572
All right, this past Friday was Disney Plus
Day. I didn't even really know that was gonna

122
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:04,414
be a thing until like a few weeks beforehand.
But basically, it kind of served as a news

123
00:11:04,454 --> 00:11:09,176
event for what the past year held on Disney
Plus as well as what's to come. Yeah, it was

124
00:11:09,196 --> 00:11:14,819
kind of like a lame version of the DC fandom,
right? If by lame you mean better with more

125
00:11:14,859 --> 00:11:22,754
news, then yeah, lame. I didn't mean that. We
got quite a few. Surprise announcements in

126
00:11:22,794 --> 00:11:27,676
addition to first looks at some of the upcoming
shows that were announced a while ago Including

127
00:11:27,856 --> 00:11:32,818
Moon Knight she Hulk and Ms. Marvel We'll go
over those first looks first starting with

128
00:11:32,938 --> 00:11:37,060
Moon Knight Which is kind of turning out to
be way different than I thought it was gonna

129
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,422
be it looks definitely more mature than any
other Disney plus show that has come out so

130
00:11:41,482 --> 00:11:47,365
far almost like a Netflix series looking show
It looks dark which is great because it's a

131
00:11:47,425 --> 00:11:52,266
Moon Knight so it should seeing him just like
clobber some guy on the ground in this white

132
00:11:52,346 --> 00:11:57,788
cape and hood was kind of frightening. Yeah,
the costume looks really good in the comics.

133
00:11:58,028 --> 00:12:02,569
When you draw an all white costume, you can
still really hide it through shadow. But in

134
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:08,531
live action, he looks very immaculate, almost
priestly in his garb, which is, yeah, kind

135
00:12:08,551 --> 00:12:13,292
of like haunting, you know, seeing him leap
across that night sky with the crescent moon

136
00:12:13,312 --> 00:12:18,174
in the background was everything I wanted it
to be. It was so freaking cool. It's everything

137
00:12:18,214 --> 00:12:22,917
I've ever wanted to see in a Batman movie. Well,
Batman can't leap across a whole city street.

138
00:12:23,218 --> 00:12:28,582
What? He can leap across an alley, sure, but
he's not superhuman. He can grapple across

139
00:12:28,662 --> 00:12:33,025
a city street. I mean, he could glide though.
That's true, that's true. But if you're aware

140
00:12:33,045 --> 00:12:36,328
of the Moon Knight character, you know that
he has strength that waxes and wanes with the

141
00:12:36,368 --> 00:12:40,671
phases of the moon, so it's apt here. I think
the thing that shocked me the most though was

142
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:46,135
Oscar Isaac's voices that he does for his different
personalities. Like his Mark Spector or maybe

143
00:12:46,175 --> 00:12:50,958
Jake Lockley has a British accent, which was
interesting compared to his Moon Knight voice,

144
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:55,922
which is very dark and almost Batman-esque.
It was really cool. Kind of creepy, which again

145
00:12:56,202 --> 00:13:00,785
is pretty good and pretty apt. We don't get
a lot of footage here, but the fact that Oscar

146
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:05,729
Isaac seems to be as confused with what we're
seeing as you know, we are is a good sign.

147
00:13:05,789 --> 00:13:09,952
I think. Yeah. He's switching in and out of
his multiple personalities. The way the show

148
00:13:09,992 --> 00:13:14,051
seems to be handling that looks fascinating.
Just like Fight Club, like how we describe

149
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:18,695
the character in our duel episode with him against
Batman. Oh, like Tyler Durden? Yeah, exactly.

150
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:22,438
I'm definitely looking forward to this one.
We don't have a release date, do we? No, we

151
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:26,241
don't have release dates for any of these. They
all say that they're just streaming soon. So

152
00:13:26,302 --> 00:13:31,266
next year sometime. The next first look that
we got was of Ms. Marvel. We didn't get a look

153
00:13:31,426 --> 00:13:36,911
at her costume or of her using her powers, really.
We do see this like purple energy emanate from

154
00:13:36,951 --> 00:13:41,310
her. But it was the first live-action footage
we're getting from the show. We see her kind

155
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:46,375
of struggle with her identity as a hero, her
family praying as Muslims, and claiming that

156
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:50,739
heroes don't usually look like brown girls from
Jersey. The only costume that we really see

157
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:56,765
her in is when she's wearing her Captain Marvel
Halloween costume, which I think is what maybe

158
00:13:56,785 --> 00:14:01,869
a lot of us would do as kids if we first discover
superpowers and we don't have any sort of like

159
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:06,053
tailor, you know? We'll just put on the superhero
costume of the hero that we admire the most.

160
00:14:06,538 --> 00:14:11,660
I like that angle here as kind of a nod to her
origin in the comic books and the origin of

161
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,382
her superhero name. We do get to see her like
running across the sky, which I thought was

162
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:20,484
interesting. I'm really curious to see how they're
going to depict her power. Yeah, it's not going

163
00:14:20,504 --> 00:14:24,806
to be stretching really like how it is in the
comics. Essentially, it looks like her bangle

164
00:14:24,826 --> 00:14:28,988
that she wears on her wrist, which she wears
in the comics as an heirloom, that's going

165
00:14:29,008 --> 00:14:33,269
to be the source of her superpowers. It emanates
like this personal energy field around her.

166
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:38,520
that she can manipulate in a way that is akin
to stretching, like enlarging her fists or

167
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,562
stretching her legs out or something like that.
It's gotta be like Kree technology or something,

168
00:14:42,622 --> 00:14:48,065
right? Perhaps. It's an interesting take. I
think they're doing it, one, for special effects

169
00:14:48,085 --> 00:14:54,729
reasons, two, to make it so that Mr. Fantastic
is the first elastic hero within the MCU, and

170
00:14:54,769 --> 00:15:00,272
three, to make all of the Marvel's characters
in the upcoming The Marvel's film all energy-based,

171
00:15:00,512 --> 00:15:06,071
including Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel, and Photon.
Makes sense. The next first look we got was

172
00:15:06,211 --> 00:15:10,733
of She-Hulk, and this was our first glimpse
of the logo, which I thought was pretty weird.

173
00:15:10,773 --> 00:15:15,135
It almost looks something like the practice
or Ally McBeal or something like that. Like

174
00:15:15,155 --> 00:15:21,157
Nip Tuck. Yeah, Nip Tuck, yeah, that was interesting.
It looks very like 90s legal drama. And I wonder

175
00:15:21,197 --> 00:15:25,119
if that's the vibe that the show is going for,
because toward the end of this teaser, which

176
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:28,881
starts off with Jennifer Walters introducing
herself, and then we see a glimpse of her in

177
00:15:28,901 --> 00:15:33,551
her She-Hulk form, at the end. She's like breaking
the fourth wall like the character does in

178
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:37,834
the comics, speaking to the audience and saying,
don't make me angry, you wouldn't like me when

179
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:43,478
I'm angry. And that setting in which she does
it looks very 90s. I was gonna say 70s. Yeah,

180
00:15:43,498 --> 00:15:47,961
could be 70s. Anywhere between like the 70s
and 90s, I would say. Okay. I wonder if it's

181
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:51,164
gonna be like a lawyer commercial or something
like that. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know

182
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,805
what's happening there. It's really strange
that like Bruce Banner was just kind of...

183
00:15:54,046 --> 00:15:58,688
standing still in the background. I wonder if
like everybody freezes in the show as she speaks

184
00:15:58,728 --> 00:16:03,011
to the audience in the same way like saved by
the bell or something like that. I never knew

185
00:16:03,031 --> 00:16:07,334
that She-Hulk broke the fourth wall in the comics.
That seems so weird to me. Yeah, she used to

186
00:16:07,354 --> 00:16:10,916
do all the time way before Deadpool was doing
it. It does look like they're gonna go the

187
00:16:10,976 --> 00:16:15,919
CG route with She-Hulk just like the Hulk and
not just like paint her skin green. I hope

188
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:20,942
the special effects on Tatiana Maslany are as
good as they are on Mark Ruffalo. I'll be really

189
00:16:20,962 --> 00:16:25,564
interested to see like the facial expressions
on this character design. Timeline-wise, it

190
00:16:25,604 --> 00:16:32,488
appears like this may take place in between
the events of Avengers Endgame and Shang-Chi

191
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:36,791
because we see the Hulk here in his Professor
Hulk form. But I can't be certain on that.

192
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:40,493
Maybe Mark Ruffalo can still change back and
forth while still retaining his personality.

193
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,756
I was gonna say that this takes place before
because the Hulk's arm isn't like scarred and

194
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:49,210
broken and damaged. Yeah, that's a great point.
That's a great point. We'll see when the show

195
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:53,273
comes out next year. So that was really it for
the first looks. We did get a brief glimpse

196
00:16:53,393 --> 00:16:57,636
of Samuel L. Jackson's character as he's going
to appear in Secret Invasion, in which he has

197
00:16:57,656 --> 00:17:02,459
a longer beard and isn't wearing the eye patch,
which is interesting. Makes me suspect he's

198
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:07,603
a Skrull. Right off the bat. We also got announcements
that they're coming out with a season two of

199
00:17:07,683 --> 00:17:12,026
What If, which we already knew. But we did get
new announcements of shows that were not announced

200
00:17:12,046 --> 00:17:18,154
previously by Disney Plus, including Echo, which
will be a spinoff of the Hawkeye series. Marvel

201
00:17:18,194 --> 00:17:24,196
Zombies, which might be an animated spin-off
of What If? Agatha House of Harkness, which

202
00:17:24,236 --> 00:17:28,958
is definitely a spin-off of WandaVision. And
most surprisingly, a show called Spider-Man

203
00:17:29,018 --> 00:17:33,940
Freshman Year, which will be animated, perhaps
voiced by Tom Holland or maybe the actor who

204
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,082
did Spider-Man's voice in What If? But basically
it looks like it's going to recount Spider-Man's

205
00:17:38,262 --> 00:17:42,784
origin story within the MCU. Which is really
cool, because we never got to see that. Yeah,

206
00:17:42,804 --> 00:17:48,018
I'm excited for this, for sure. They also announced
that they will be doing more X-Men cartoons,

207
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:52,822
like the 90s version of the X-Men. I was surprised
that they put the Marvel Studios banner above

208
00:17:52,842 --> 00:17:57,006
that one, considering it's not part of the MCU
though. No, it's like an alternate universe

209
00:17:57,106 --> 00:18:01,349
X-Men, kind of. It's great that they're bringing
that back though. Hopefully with better animation

210
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:06,433
and fingers crossed it's the same voice cast.
This will be Marvel Studios first X-Men project,

211
00:18:06,714 --> 00:18:11,838
which is also exciting. Oh yeah, so much to
look forward to. Way better than that fan dome

212
00:18:11,878 --> 00:18:18,939
crap, who needs that when you have Disney Plus
Day? Oh gosh. Yay logos! Yay for logos. Marvel

213
00:18:18,959 --> 00:18:23,421
fans always excited by them logos. I mean, we
didn't even get a logo for Blue Beetle or Batgirl.

214
00:18:23,681 --> 00:18:28,604
So how about that? No, we got to see concept
art of them in costume. Oh, concept art. Yay.

215
00:18:28,924 --> 00:18:33,146
Whatever, dude. All I'm saying is I got way
more pumped from this news than I did at the

216
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:37,729
fandom. I'm sorry. What's your name again? Marvelous
Joe? OK, that makes sense. I can't wait till

217
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:42,011
we get dates on all of these. It looks like
next year is going to be just as big of a year

218
00:18:42,311 --> 00:18:48,255
as 2021 was. Lots to look forward to. Lots to
review. Too much Marvel stuff to watch. Ugh.

219
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:52,567
But regarding all the news to come out at Disney
Plus Day, that brings us to our question of

220
00:18:52,587 --> 00:18:52,928
the week.

for the news for this episode. Let's go ahead

227
00:19:26,414 --> 00:19:32,876
and get a word from our sponsor, HBO Max. Bruce
Wayne may appear to be a wealthy playboy, but

228
00:19:32,896 --> 00:19:38,359
beneath his facade, his true identity is that
of the Batman waging an endless war against

229
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:44,141
crime. Join the caped crusader in Batman, the
audio adventures, the first scripted audio

230
00:19:44,201 --> 00:19:49,463
original featuring Batman and his villainous
rogues gallery in a world premiere story of

231
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:57,118
life and death in Gotham City, debuting exclusively
on HBO Max. Starring Jeffrey Wright as Batman

232
00:19:57,178 --> 00:20:01,639
and a who's who of incredible Saturday Night
Live alums, this rollicking adventure, told

233
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:07,421
across 10 episodes, is written and directed
by Emmy winner Dennis McNicholas, includes

234
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:13,183
devilishly delightful original music by Doug
Bossie, and performances by Rosario Dawson,

235
00:20:13,443 --> 00:20:20,045
John Leguizamo, Chris Parnell, Melissa Villaseñor,
Seth Meyers, Jason Sudeikis, Brooke Shields,

236
00:20:20,365 --> 00:20:27,266
Fred Armisen, and many, many more. Go to HBOmax.com
slash Batman Audio Adventures for more and

237
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:35,092
stream Batman The Audio Adventures only on HBO
Max. Thanks to HBO Max for sponsoring this

238
00:20:35,132 --> 00:20:38,757
episode. Now let's go ahead and get into our
main event where we find out who would win

239
00:20:38,797 --> 00:20:44,325
in a fight between the supernatural teams of
DC's Justice League Dark and Marvel's Midnight

240
00:20:44,445 --> 00:20:44,805
Suns.

241
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:05,331
Okay, Justice League Dark versus the Midnight
Suns. These are both DC and Marvel's most prominent,

242
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:10,353
supernatural super teams. Though I gotta be
honest, I only learned about the Midnight Suns

243
00:21:10,493 --> 00:21:15,154
like earlier this year. Well, yeah, I told you
about them when we were trying to come up with

244
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:20,156
our next team duel episode. I thought it would
be really cool since Episode 250 was gonna

245
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:25,257
land around the same time as Halloween to do
a kind of Halloween themed team duel. Right.

246
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,833
It's a little disappointing that we're two weeks
past Halloween now, but that's just how the

247
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:34,317
episodes fell. Basically, we didn't want to
skip a review because then we'd be pushing

248
00:21:34,357 --> 00:21:38,641
back all of the review episodes that we were
going to do. But to me, it was never the end

249
00:21:38,661 --> 00:21:42,625
of the Halloween season until we got to this
episode. I'm going to get right back into it.

250
00:21:42,685 --> 00:21:48,049
Just jack-o-lanterns and black cats and autumn
leaves falling in the dead of night. That's

251
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,953
where my mind is at right now. Yeah, the duel
is supposed to not take place in any kind of

252
00:21:51,993 --> 00:21:56,126
environment. But that's the environment I'm
going to be imagining for this matchup. Now

253
00:21:56,146 --> 00:22:00,508
the only prime exposure I have to Justice League
Dark is the movie that we reviewed a couple

254
00:22:00,548 --> 00:22:05,369
years ago, the animated film Justice League
Dark, and its sequel, Justice League Dark Apocalypse

255
00:22:05,409 --> 00:22:10,790
War. Yeah, that wasn't quite a sequel specifically
to Justice League Dark. I'm not sure why they

256
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:14,531
called that film Justice League Dark Apocalypse
War. It probably should have just been like

257
00:22:14,671 --> 00:22:20,053
Apocalypse War. But yeah, both of those films
featured characters from Justice League Dark.

258
00:22:20,393 --> 00:22:24,680
Back when we started this podcast too, We were
talking about how Guillermo del Toro was supposed

259
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:28,843
to make a Justice League Dark movie. I think
he was calling it Dark Universe at the time,

260
00:22:29,184 --> 00:22:33,287
and that seemed like it was really cool. Still
waiting for that to materialize. But I guess

261
00:22:33,327 --> 00:22:37,831
that JJ Abrams is working on bringing some of
those characters to the screen for HBO Max,

262
00:22:37,891 --> 00:22:43,056
like as we speak. So that's exciting. Yeah,
and sometime in 2022, we're supposed to get

263
00:22:43,176 --> 00:22:48,321
a Midnight Suns video game, which I think will
be the primary exposure of that team to the

264
00:22:48,341 --> 00:22:54,125
world at large. It is spelled S-U-N-S, which
the developer did to make the team seem more

265
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:59,248
inclusive. And in that video game, the team
is actually named after a rare astronomical

266
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:04,492
event, during which time the demon character
Lilith attempts to resurrect C'thun, the Elder

267
00:23:04,512 --> 00:23:09,976
God of Chaos. So I actually think that's pretty
cool. I think the name reads cooler with S-U-N-S,

268
00:23:10,396 --> 00:23:15,059
and I do think that Marvel will follow suit
with the next incarnation of the team. So the

269
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:20,491
title of this podcast will use that newer spelling.
S-U-N-S? Yeah. Well, I can't wait to learn

270
00:23:20,531 --> 00:23:24,534
more about them. If you've never listened to
one of our duel episodes before, the way we

271
00:23:24,594 --> 00:23:29,718
determine a winner for these two teams is by
running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations using

272
00:23:29,758 --> 00:23:34,501
their statistics. And actually it's more than
1000 when we do team duels, we're actually

273
00:23:34,521 --> 00:23:40,486
comparing matrices of data. Yeah, between each
character, so it's 49,000 Monte Carlo simulations

274
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:44,689
technically. Friggin' crazy. It takes a long
time. Now if you're wondering what a Monte

275
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:49,951
Carlo simulation is, It's a probabilistic model
used to determine outcomes through random sampling.

276
00:23:50,351 --> 00:23:55,212
And in our case, it randomizes statistics along
a normal distribution, which is a bell curve

277
00:23:55,512 --> 00:23:59,874
as a way to simulate the many variables that
can occur during battle. The stat parameters

278
00:23:59,934 --> 00:24:05,235
we use are based on the official Marvel Power
Grid, and we use that criteria to extrapolate

279
00:24:05,275 --> 00:24:09,556
the DC character stats. We've included some
additional stat categories of our own, such

280
00:24:09,596 --> 00:24:14,863
as range, damage potential, versatility, and
perception. in order to create a more complete

281
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:20,486
and robust simulation. Running these 1000 simulations
gives us a percentage of wins for each team,

282
00:24:20,786 --> 00:24:25,209
and we declare the team with the higher percentage
to be the ultimate victor considering that

283
00:24:25,229 --> 00:24:31,173
they're more likely to win any given battle.
No characters ever win 100% of the time. Comics

284
00:24:31,193 --> 00:24:35,735
have shown that there's always a way for Batman
to defeat Superman, so we feel our method falls

285
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:40,234
in line with the precedents that have been established
in the comic book stories. And we used this

286
00:24:40,274 --> 00:24:44,938
method because it was the least subjective,
most unbiased way to determine who would win.

287
00:24:45,258 --> 00:24:49,142
Of course, we are both heavily biased toward
our respective allegiances, and instead of

288
00:24:49,222 --> 00:24:54,346
debating these matches forever, we just let
the math decide for us. So there's no fan votes

289
00:24:54,366 --> 00:24:59,691
here, and no relying on just feats. Before we
run the simulations though, we like to break

290
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:05,796
down each team's histories and rosters, before
improvising a scenario on how we imagine one

291
00:25:05,816 --> 00:25:10,238
of these simulations would play out beat for
beat. It's been a while since we've done a

292
00:25:10,298 --> 00:25:15,080
duel episode. Yeah, I think not since Manbat
vs Morbius, like almost a month. It's crazy.

293
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,222
It's crazy. So many reviews. But I think it's
my turn to go first with the DC backstory,

294
00:25:20,523 --> 00:25:24,924
so let me tell you all about Justice League
Dark. Now, though the most recent iteration

295
00:25:24,984 --> 00:25:30,487
of the team is known as Justice League Dark,
the Magic-based group is much less renowned

296
00:25:30,547 --> 00:25:34,648
than the popular superteam, the Justice League,
which you can learn more about in our 100th

297
00:25:35,129 --> 00:25:40,679
episode, Justice League vs Avengers. Justice
League Dark actually has its roots in a team

298
00:25:40,699 --> 00:25:46,181
known as the Sentinels of Magic, which emerged
in the Day of Judgment storyline where the

299
00:25:46,221 --> 00:25:51,603
demon Etrigan tricked the hostless spirit of
vengeance known as the Spectre to bond with

300
00:25:51,643 --> 00:25:57,906
the fallen angel Asmodel in Hell. With his new,
nearly limitless power, Asmodel caused Hell

301
00:25:57,926 --> 00:26:04,049
to freeze over and unleashed hordes of demons
on Earth as well as powerful, evil spirits

302
00:26:04,309 --> 00:26:09,804
such as the Enchantress. With the Justice League
and Justice Society overwhelmed, magicians,

303
00:26:09,964 --> 00:26:16,288
sorcerers, and occultists from around the world
joined together, namely Zatanna, the Phantom

304
00:26:16,328 --> 00:26:23,573
Stranger, Madame Xanadu, Deadman, Raven, Ragman,
Faust, Doctor Occult, and the Green Lantern,

305
00:26:23,653 --> 00:26:29,617
Ellen Scott, in order to stop Asmodel and find
a new host for the Spectre. After slaying the

306
00:26:29,657 --> 00:26:36,522
Enchantress to reignite the fires of Hell, the
Sentinels helped the who you can learn more

307
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:41,584
about in our Green Lantern vs Nova episode.
Eventually, Hull Jordan was separated from

308
00:26:41,624 --> 00:26:47,706
the Spectre's spirit, which was manipulated
by the spirit of wrath known as Eclipso, into

309
00:26:47,726 --> 00:26:53,329
destroying all magic. You can learn more about
this in our Spectre vs Galactus episode. Now,

310
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:58,271
after the Spectre destroyed the Rock of Eternity,
an incapacitated sorcerer is powerful enough

311
00:26:58,291 --> 00:27:04,634
to stop him, such as Dr. Fate and Madam Xanadu,
several other magic users banded together to

312
00:27:04,654 --> 00:27:10,556
take a stand against the Spectre, including
a resurrected Enchantress, Blue Devil, Ragman,

313
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:17,659
Nightmaster, Nightshade, and Detective Chimp,
forming a team known as Shadow Pact. Though

314
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,441
Zatanna wasn't an official member of the team,
she and other magical heroes did help them

315
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:28,423
reform the Rock of Eternity. Shadow Pact was
unsuccessful in stopping the hostless Spectre,

316
00:27:28,623 --> 00:27:29,924
whose threat to magic was

317
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:40,273
by Heaven after the Spectre killed the powerful
ancient wizards Shazam and Naboo. Shadow Pact

318
00:27:40,373 --> 00:27:46,417
remained together, operating out of the Oblivion
Bar, which existed in a pocket dimension accessible

319
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:52,020
to magic users, and taking on new members such
as the angel Zareel, who you can learn more

320
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:57,503
about in our Zareel vs Archangel episode. Together,
they defeated magical threats to Earth from

321
00:27:57,543 --> 00:28:02,665
groups such as the Pentechol and the Congregation,
and they stopped villains like Dr. Gotham.

322
00:28:03,274 --> 00:28:08,818
In post-Flashpoint continuity, DC's premier
Magic team became known as Justice League Dark,

323
00:28:09,219 --> 00:28:16,225
a team initially consisting of John Constantine,
Zatanna, Deadman, Shade, Mindwarp, and Madame

324
00:28:16,285 --> 00:28:22,410
Xanadu, the latter of whom brought the team
together to stop the succubus Enchantress after

325
00:28:22,430 --> 00:28:28,215
she became unbound to her host, June Moon, and
defeated the Justice League. Constantine was

326
00:28:28,295 --> 00:28:33,924
able to re-bind Enchantress to June Moon, and
the team disbanded for a short time before

327
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:39,588
coming together again, sans mind warp, to fend
off Kane and his legion of vampires. Joined

328
00:28:39,608 --> 00:28:44,913
by the vampire Andrew Bennett from the series
I, Vampire, the team defeated Kane, drawing

329
00:28:44,933 --> 00:28:50,037
the attention of the government agency Argus,
who actually gave the team the name Justice

330
00:28:50,077 --> 00:28:55,321
League Dark. Argus commissioned the League to
stop the sorcerer Faust, who planned on taking

331
00:28:55,361 --> 00:29:02,022
control of all magic using the Books of Magic.
That's a clever name. That was the name of

332
00:29:02,062 --> 00:29:07,687
the Timothy Hunter book written by Neil Gaiman
for Vertigo. Now after accidentally unleashing

333
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:13,652
the Demons III, a trio of powerful demons under
Faust's control, the team discovered Faust

334
00:29:13,692 --> 00:29:19,737
was actually working for Nick Necro, the mentor
to both Constantine and Zatanna. With the help

335
00:29:19,777 --> 00:29:26,123
of Black Orchid, Frankenstein, Amethyst, and
the boy sorcerer Timothy Hunter, Nick Necro

336
00:29:26,243 --> 00:29:31,419
was defeated. During the Trinity War storyline,
Wonder Woman approached the League in order

337
00:29:31,439 --> 00:29:37,084
to help determine how a mystic artifact known
as Pandora's Box was able to manipulate Superman

338
00:29:37,204 --> 00:29:43,509
into killing. The Box, Constantine discovered,
was actually a gateway to Earth-3, home to

339
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:49,434
the Crime Syndicate and the likes of evil Justice
League doppelgangers like Ultraman, Superwoman,

340
00:29:49,574 --> 00:29:54,739
and Owlman, who broke through Pandora's Box
and trapped all the members of the Justice

341
00:29:54,779 --> 00:30:00,602
League, Justice League of America, and Justice
League Dark. Constantine, however, was rescued

342
00:30:00,742 --> 00:30:06,185
by the Justice League Dark's base of operations,
the sentient and interdimensional House of

343
00:30:06,265 --> 00:30:12,768
Mystery. With the help of Nightmare Nurse, Swamp
Thing, the Phantom Stranger, Pandora, Zareal,

344
00:30:12,848 --> 00:30:19,090
and Deadman, the latter of whom also escaped
capture, Constantine located Zatanna, and together,

345
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:24,212
they stopped Nick Necro and Faust again, who
had partnered with the Crime Syndicate, but

346
00:30:24,252 --> 00:30:28,490
this time, they stopped him in Nandaparbat.
which you can learn more about in our Dead

347
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:35,134
Man vs. Magic episode. Their battle there eventually
awakened an evil old god of Nandaparbat, Pantheon,

348
00:30:35,274 --> 00:30:39,977
whom the Justice League Dark managed to defeat.
When their House of Mystery merged with Nick

349
00:30:40,037 --> 00:30:45,520
Necro's House of Secrets to form the House of
Wonder, the League was forced to destroy it

350
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:50,643
since it had become powerful enough to conquer
the planet. After the events of Dark Knight's

351
00:30:50,703 --> 00:30:56,194
Metal resulted in a break in the Source Wall,
Magic was thrown into flux. and Wonder Woman

352
00:30:56,234 --> 00:31:02,075
formed a new Justice League Dark Team in response.
This team initially consisted of Wonder Woman,

353
00:31:02,215 --> 00:31:07,657
Zatanna, Detective Chimp, Manbat, and Swamp
Thing, though it wasn't long before Constantine

354
00:31:07,677 --> 00:31:13,739
got involved in a battle against the hostless
spirit of Naboo, as Dr. Fate, who was trying

355
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:20,020
to destroy the chaos of magic by summoning the
Upside-Down Man and the other kind to devour

356
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:25,966
it. Wonder Woman was able to fend off the Upside-Down
Man, however, thanks to a burgeoning magical

357
00:31:26,026 --> 00:31:32,148
ability that she later learned was derived from
the Greek goddess of magic, Hecate. After Hecate

358
00:31:32,188 --> 00:31:37,129
corrupted and took control of Wonder Woman and
several other magic heroines, including Black

359
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:43,331
Orchid, Manitou Dawn, and Witchfire, Wonder
Woman used the Upside-Down Men to devour Hecate

360
00:31:43,591 --> 00:31:49,292
and free the women from her curse. After Detective
Chip inherited the Sword of Nightmaster, he

361
00:31:49,312 --> 00:31:55,303
was able to transfer many heroes to the Mystic
Realm of Myrrah. including Swamp Thing, Etrigan,

362
00:31:55,403 --> 00:32:00,668
and Deadman, where they would be safe from being
devoured by the upside down man and his other

363
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:06,513
kind. Naboo and the other Lords of Order, however,
were able to invade the realm and began stripping

364
00:32:06,533 --> 00:32:12,238
the citizens there of magic. Zatanna and Wonder
Woman, meanwhile, were transformed into Lords

365
00:32:12,258 --> 00:32:17,983
of Chaos for a time by the Chaos Lord Mordru,
and the League defeated the Lords of Order

366
00:32:18,223 --> 00:32:23,590
with Wonder Woman bringing magic back to the
world. With Wonder Woman's arch-nemesis Cersei

367
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:29,453
now in control of Hecate's magic, Cersei formed
an Injustice League Dark villain team, in which

368
00:32:29,473 --> 00:32:35,115
she allowed herself to be possessed by Eclipso
and teamed up with Floronic Man, Clarion the

369
00:32:35,155 --> 00:32:40,877
Witch Boy, Papa Midnight, and Solomon Grundy.
Thanks to help from the Upside-Down Men and

370
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:46,220
the other kind, the League was able to stop
the Injustice League Dark. Recently, the Injustice

371
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:52,415
League Dark team became more closely partnered
with the Justice League, became a new official

372
00:32:52,435 --> 00:32:57,759
member of the team as the most powerful and
dangerous sorcerer, Merlin, was resurrected.

373
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:03,504
And that's the team's history so far. Now there
are a ton of magic-based superheroes in DC,

374
00:33:03,884 --> 00:33:08,669
many of whom have been members of the Justice
League Dark and its previous incarnations.

375
00:33:09,169 --> 00:33:13,853
One character that has been in almost every
iteration of the team, however, is Zatanna.

376
00:33:14,173 --> 00:33:19,938
So she was a no-brainer, as was Constantine,
who's not the biggest team player, but a powerful

377
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:26,861
and popular figure in DC's world of magic. Like
Zatanna and Constantine, Deadman was an original

378
00:33:26,901 --> 00:33:32,903
member of the first Justice League Dark team,
so he's in, as is Swamp Thing, who was also

379
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:38,066
there early on thanks to his ties to Constantine.
A lot of these characters so far have had their

380
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:43,148
own Vertigo titles, so in keeping with that,
I wanted to include Black Orchid on the team

381
00:33:43,448 --> 00:33:48,082
since she was a more prominent member of the
initial team than characters like F- Frankenstein

382
00:33:48,182 --> 00:33:53,686
Amethyst or the Vampire Andrew Bennett. Since
what Roman took over the team, both Detective

383
00:33:53,706 --> 00:34:00,491
Chimp and Manbat have become mainstays, though
of the two, I opted for Manbat due to his versatility.

384
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:05,514
And finally, I chose my seventh team member
to be Etrigan. He's only been a member of the

385
00:34:05,554 --> 00:34:10,477
Justice League Dark for a short time, but Jason
Blood is often depicted as being on the team

386
00:34:10,818 --> 00:34:18,215
in other media and alternate timelines, including
the and even Guillermo del Toro's Justice League

387
00:34:18,255 --> 00:34:24,200
Dark script. So that's my team. Yeah, that makes
sense. What do you think of the name Justice

388
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:28,624
League Dark? Because you mentioned their previous
incarnations as like the Sentinels of Magic

389
00:34:28,664 --> 00:34:33,748
and stuff. I think that's way better and less
derivative. Yeah, it's named Justice League

390
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:38,792
Dark so that it sells, but I would much prefer
a team name of like Shadow Pact or something

391
00:34:38,812 --> 00:34:43,316
like that for sure. Or even like Constantine's
like old band name, Yookus Membrane. I'm sure

392
00:34:43,356 --> 00:34:48,632
he would have voted for that over Justice League
Dark. Yeah, I think when it comes to the names

393
00:34:48,652 --> 00:34:52,915
of these teams, Midnight Suns is just way better.
And actually, they're just a better team in

394
00:34:52,975 --> 00:34:57,439
general when you think about it. And I think
our listeners agree when they compare the Justice

395
00:34:57,459 --> 00:35:03,263
League Dark backstory to the Midnight Suns backstory.
Okay, let's hear it. So the story of the Midnight

396
00:35:03,323 --> 00:35:08,967
Suns goes back hundreds of years, beginning
as an ancient secret order of protectors with

397
00:35:08,987 --> 00:35:13,863
the mission of stopping supernatural threats
to humanity. Their ranks included members that

398
00:35:13,883 --> 00:35:19,647
were reputed to have a taste of damnation, those
with some measure of exposure to the darkness

399
00:35:19,727 --> 00:35:25,231
of paranormal, mystical, and hellish evils on
Earth. Their greatest feat among battling the

400
00:35:25,271 --> 00:35:30,736
likes of Dracula was the defeat of Lilith, the
mother of all demons and former wife of the

401
00:35:30,816 --> 00:35:36,620
devil himself. The Midnight Suns cast her and
her children, the Lilin, to a dark dimensional

402
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:41,575
prison called the Shadow Side. though it was
prophesied among the Order that she would one

403
00:35:41,595 --> 00:35:47,257
day return and that nine of their own would
stand against her. That day came hundreds of

404
00:35:47,277 --> 00:35:52,399
years later when Doctor Strange, the Sorcerer
Supreme, detected a rift in the Shadow Side

405
00:35:52,499 --> 00:35:56,781
and that Lilith would soon escape and come back
to Earth. He knew that he couldn't face her

406
00:35:56,801 --> 00:36:00,963
himself because the magical energies that would
stem from the battle would weaken the dimensional

407
00:36:00,983 --> 00:36:05,825
barriers between the two realms, and so he would
have to gather the nine together that were

408
00:36:05,845 --> 00:36:11,409
foretold in the prophecy. Doctor Strange reached
out to his occasional ally, Johnny Blaze, who

409
00:36:11,429 --> 00:36:16,052
was host to Ghost Rider, the vengeful demon,
and his brother, Ketch, who was host to the

410
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:21,757
Spirit of Vengeance, both of whom had also seen
a vision of Lilith's return. On their motorcycles,

411
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:27,121
the brothers traveled to gather Doctor Strange's
recruits, including the reluctant pseudo-vampire

412
00:36:27,162 --> 00:36:32,046
Morbius, and the group known as the Nightstalkers,
who were Hannibal King, the self-loathing vampire

413
00:36:32,086 --> 00:36:37,862
detective, Frank Drake, a descendant of Dracula,
and the daywalker, Blade. the Vampire Hunter.

414
00:36:38,282 --> 00:36:43,485
The last of their recruits were three experts
on the occult and the Darkhold, a book of black

415
00:36:43,545 --> 00:36:50,289
magic. They were Victoria Montessi, Sam Buchanan,
and Louise Hastings, together known as the

416
00:36:50,349 --> 00:36:55,752
Darkhold Redeemers. Dude, the Books of Magic
is a way better name than the Darkhold. I noticed

417
00:36:55,772 --> 00:37:02,455
you can't help but hide that smile as you say
that. That's right. The prophesied nine collectively

418
00:37:02,495 --> 00:37:09,131
battled and killed four of the Lilin, and who
managed to escape, though she was severely

419
00:37:09,191 --> 00:37:13,954
weakened. Though the nine heroes fulfilled the
prophecy and sealed the rift in the Shadowside,

420
00:37:14,195 --> 00:37:19,658
they knew that Lilith would soon sire more children
and try to conquer Earth's realm again. They

421
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:24,802
maintained a loose connection, though one day
Blade, in his desire to obliterate all vampires

422
00:37:24,822 --> 00:37:30,786
from existence, tried to use a spell from the
Darkhold to do so. This backfired, transforming

423
00:37:30,826 --> 00:37:36,058
him into the possessed Switchblade, who went
on a supernatural killing spree. He murdered

424
00:37:36,178 --> 00:37:40,821
many of the prophesied Nine, though the Darkhold
Redeemers were able to use the book to counter

425
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:46,605
the spell and undo the damage that Blade had
caused. Reunited, the group of Nine learned

426
00:37:46,705 --> 00:37:51,769
that Lilith had partnered with the demon Xerathos,
who had opened a portal to the Shadow Side

427
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:57,473
within Salem Field Cemetery. Xerathos is the
Ghost Raider? Yeah, this demon was not connected

428
00:37:57,513 --> 00:38:02,416
to Johnny Blaze at the time. Okay. The prophesied
Nine traveled to the cemetery to try to stop

429
00:38:02,536 --> 00:38:07,139
Lilith and her Lilin again, though they were
overwhelmed and had to flee with the help of

430
00:38:07,219 --> 00:38:12,221
the Caretaker. They regrouped at Dr. Strange's
Sanctum Sanctorum, where it was discovered

431
00:38:12,281 --> 00:38:18,023
that Morbius was a traitor to the Nine due to
an infection with Lilin blood. They were overrun

432
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:23,465
again, leading Dr. Strange to cast a spell that
magically detonated his Sanctum, killing the

433
00:38:23,505 --> 00:38:28,727
Lilin inside. They helped Morbius fight off
his infection, and traveled back to the cemetery

434
00:38:28,827 --> 00:38:34,478
and used a magic medallion provided by the Caretaker
to send Lilith back to the Shadow Side. They

435
00:38:34,558 --> 00:38:39,661
also defeated Xerathos and his followers using
a mystic sword, though throughout the whole

436
00:38:39,681 --> 00:38:45,124
ordeal, several members of the Nine fell in
battle. With Lilith finally gone for good,

437
00:38:45,264 --> 00:38:51,368
the surviving members, including Ghost Rider,
Strange, Blade, and Morbius, underwent a ceremony

438
00:38:51,448 --> 00:38:56,491
in which they were branded with the mark of
the Midnight Suns, a flaming dagger that resembles

439
00:38:56,531 --> 00:39:01,998
a small cross, officially making them members
of the ancient order. Years later, a zombie

440
00:39:02,018 --> 00:39:06,901
virus infiltrated Earth's realm through the
nexus of all realities, located in the swamp

441
00:39:07,162 --> 00:39:12,165
where the creature known as Manthing lived.
Morbius saw the need for a supernatural fighting

442
00:39:12,185 --> 00:39:17,348
force to return and formed a new Midnight Suns
group consisting of himself, Jennifer Kael,

443
00:39:17,428 --> 00:39:22,031
who is Ghost Rider's cousin, Hellstorm, the
son of Satan, Jack Russell, the werewolf by

444
00:39:22,071 --> 00:39:27,819
night, and Manthing. Though Morbius' zombie
cure failed, the team was able to mystically

445
00:39:27,859 --> 00:39:34,263
transfer the virus into one person named Simon
Garth, aka Zombie, a man who was already undead

446
00:39:34,383 --> 00:39:39,967
due to a voodoo curse. Later, the city of Las
Vegas was burned down and sent to hell during

447
00:39:40,007 --> 00:39:46,051
a takeover by the criminal organization Hydra.
The city was resurrected using magic, but while

448
00:39:46,091 --> 00:39:52,516
it was in hell, Mephisto had created a casino
called Hotel Inferno. It was brought to earth

449
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:58,199
with the rest of Vegas, where gamblers could
bet- their very souls. Holy crap! Doctor Strange

450
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:03,981
made a deal with Mephisto where if Strange won,
the casino's souls would be set free and Mephisto

451
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:09,283
and the Hotel Inferno would return to hell.
If Strange lost, Mephisto could claim his soul.

452
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:15,266
Notified of the wager, Strange's assistant,
Wong, summoned the Midnight Suns again, including

453
00:40:15,386 --> 00:40:20,728
Blade, Ghost Rider, and Man-Thing, with new
recruits Brother Voodoo, Moon Knight, Iron

454
00:40:20,768 --> 00:40:26,702
Fist, Scarlet Spider, and Elsa Bloodstone. Together,
they traveled to Vegas and fought Mephisto's

455
00:40:26,762 --> 00:40:31,924
Demon Army. Ghost Rider fought Mephisto head
on, who killed Johnny Blaze and sent him to

456
00:40:31,964 --> 00:40:37,186
Hell. There, Blaze and the Spirit of Vengeance
freed the Casino's captured souls from their

457
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:43,588
vault and usurped the Crown and Throne of Hell,
cutting Mephisto off from his power. The rest

458
00:40:43,628 --> 00:40:49,309
of the team then defeated the Demon Lord and
saved Doctor Strange's soul. That's the comics

459
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:54,231
team history. I did want to note that the upcoming
video game that renames the team to Midnight

460
00:40:54,271 --> 00:41:00,152
Suns with a U does recruit other Mystic heroes
such as Niko Minoru, a former Runaways character,

461
00:41:00,392 --> 00:41:06,394
and the new mutant member known as Magic. Which
makes sense. Yeah. For this team duel, I chose

462
00:41:06,454 --> 00:41:11,796
seven members to represent the Midnight Suns.
Doctor Strange, who is Marvel's foremost Magic

463
00:41:11,856 --> 00:41:16,677
hero and who was the initial recruiter for this
present-day incarnation of the Order. Ghost

464
00:41:16,717 --> 00:41:22,119
Rider. first gathered the team and is also a
supernatural heavy hitter. Blade and Morbius,

465
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:28,242
both original members with vampiric abilities.
Man-Thing who is recruited into Morbius's team

466
00:41:28,582 --> 00:41:33,224
and whom I've always thought was pretty creepy
and cool. And lastly Brother Voodoo and Bloodstone,

467
00:41:33,364 --> 00:41:38,226
both newer recruits but also characters I think
are badass and really grew to love during their

468
00:41:38,266 --> 00:41:42,168
individual duel episodes that we've done. Yeah
if you want to learn more about the individual

469
00:41:42,188 --> 00:41:46,946
characters on each of our teams we've done duel
episodes with all of them so... Definitely

470
00:41:46,966 --> 00:41:51,688
go back and check out the catalog. It's only
$2 on Spotify. I would have included characters

471
00:41:51,728 --> 00:41:55,991
like Moon Knight and Iron Fist, but of course
they were in our last team duel where we pit

472
00:41:56,031 --> 00:42:00,693
the defenders against the Suicide Squad. So
you have like two sorcerers in Doctor Strange

473
00:42:00,713 --> 00:42:06,257
and Brother Voodoo. You have two vampires in
Morbius and Blade. You have a swamp monster

474
00:42:06,497 --> 00:42:13,140
in Man-Thing, a monster hunter in Bloodstone,
and I guess a fiery demon in Ghost Rider. Bring

475
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:18,208
them on, I'll take them. I'll take them all
on. Haha so cocky, we'll see how this plays

476
00:42:18,308 --> 00:42:22,071
out. Because now that we've gotten their histories
and abilities out of the way, we're going to

477
00:42:22,131 --> 00:42:27,495
speculate on how one of the simulated matches
will go. The winner is determined by simulations,

478
00:42:27,816 --> 00:42:33,020
not the speculation, but it is fun to imagine
how this fight could play out. We don't set

479
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:37,283
any rules for this match, other than the characters
don't know anything about each other going

480
00:42:37,423 --> 00:42:42,548
in, except that the other team is a threat that
needs to be put down. And we say that each

481
00:42:42,588 --> 00:42:47,318
team starts off about 50 meters apart. in an
environment that has no bearing on the match

482
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:52,460
itself because we don't take stats for the environment.
Yeah, plus certain characters have advantages

483
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,441
in some environments over others, and we want
these teams to win on their own merit. So let's

484
00:42:57,461 --> 00:43:03,302
get into it. Justice League Dark and the Midnight
Suns meet on the battlefield. Who goes first?

485
00:43:03,363 --> 00:43:07,144
I could guarantee you right away that Constantine,
he's just gonna look at this whole situation

486
00:43:07,464 --> 00:43:12,805
and be like, oh bloody hell, and then just like
make himself disappear from the situation.

487
00:43:13,085 --> 00:43:18,199
Where does he go? He just... Turns himself invisible.
All right, so Dr. Strange, he's gonna use his

488
00:43:18,259 --> 00:43:22,640
Eye of Agamotto. You know, he's gonna fly into
the air and the eye is gonna glow and shine

489
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,861
an eye symbol onto the foreheads of each of
his teammates on the Midnight Suns, which is

490
00:43:27,881 --> 00:43:32,523
gonna grant them the Eye of Agamotto's sight.
Right, so that means that throughout the course

491
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:38,504
of this match, they can see through any illusion
or hidden being, including Deadman and the

492
00:43:38,544 --> 00:43:44,539
now hidden Constantine. What? I feel like that's
cheating. Swamp Thing, he's gonna start things

493
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:48,961
off just by shoving his hands like into the
ground and he's gonna cover the floor beneath

494
00:43:48,981 --> 00:43:52,963
the Midnight Suns with foliage and branches
before they even get a chance to move, right?

495
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:57,626
And he's just gonna grab their ankles and hold
them in place. While Etch again, he's gonna

496
00:43:57,666 --> 00:44:03,289
breathe out a blast of hellfire that just sets
that foliage ablaze and he just burns the shit

497
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:08,212
out of the Midnight Suns where they stand with
hellfire. You know that like half this team

498
00:44:08,252 --> 00:44:13,222
is like immune to fire, right? What do you mean?
I guess it's just- Ghost Rider and Brother

499
00:44:13,242 --> 00:44:17,465
Voodoo. But actually, you know what? Brother
Voodoo, not only can he control fire, he can

500
00:44:17,485 --> 00:44:21,167
also control plant life. So what Brother Voodoo
is gonna do is he's just gonna handle this.

501
00:44:21,647 --> 00:44:26,129
He's gonna release the team from the branches
that they're stuck in by commanding them to

502
00:44:26,169 --> 00:44:30,892
let go, and then he's just gonna manipulate
the Hellfire so that it extinguishes before

503
00:44:30,992 --> 00:44:35,835
it burns anyone. So like, Dr. Voodoo was the
ultimate defense against this attack. And with

504
00:44:35,855 --> 00:44:40,537
the team free, the Midnight Suns are just gonna
rush forward and charge Justice League Dark.

505
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:45,413
The fastest one on the team out of anybody here,
I think, is Ghost Rider. So on his motorcycle,

506
00:44:45,453 --> 00:44:49,035
he's going to be the first one across the battlefield.
He's just going to ride right over to Swamp

507
00:44:49,075 --> 00:44:52,878
Thing, who's like the biggest guy on the Justice
League Dark, and he's going to wrap Swamp Thing

508
00:44:52,938 --> 00:44:58,421
up in his Hellfire chains and just burn this
plant man to a crisp. Is it like Swamp Thing?

509
00:44:58,601 --> 00:45:02,144
He goes up against fire guys all the time. I
feel like he's just going to slough off the

510
00:45:02,184 --> 00:45:06,087
burnt parts, right? So he's probably just like
a pair of legs right now, but he'll regrow.

511
00:45:06,167 --> 00:45:11,334
It's fine. So like the rest of the Midnight
Sun's approach, the Justice League Dark. Zatanna,

512
00:45:11,354 --> 00:45:16,238
she's just gonna summon forth magic armor for
her entire team. She's just gonna be like Kegum

513
00:45:16,778 --> 00:45:22,663
Ram-ra-poo. What is that? That's magic armor
up. What kind of armor is this? I don't know,

514
00:45:22,683 --> 00:45:27,247
it's like medieval kind of chest plate and shoulder
armor and a helmet that's like made of light.

515
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:32,892
Okay, even for Deadman? Who's not physical?
Everyone except for a Deadman, alright? But

516
00:45:32,952 --> 00:45:39,957
Deadman, he's gonna fly into the body of Man-Thing,
alright? And possess his body becoming Deadman-Thing.

517
00:45:41,938 --> 00:45:47,401
And in this body, he's going to be attacking
Blade, just taking him by surprise, grabs his

518
00:45:47,541 --> 00:45:52,324
arm, and just burns it with a sulfuric acid
touch. Well, Blade wears a jacket, you know,

519
00:45:52,344 --> 00:45:57,006
it's like a thick, durable, heavy leather jacket.
So, you know, that's going to protect him a

520
00:45:57,046 --> 00:46:01,909
little bit from this Man-Thing touch. But Blade
is going to be surprised, yeah, and he's going

521
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:07,252
to like slice off Man-Thing's arm as it's grabbing
him. And he's going to like spin around, yanking

522
00:46:07,312 --> 00:46:12,118
off his jacket before the acid burns his flesh.
I could totally see that into Wesley Snipes'

523
00:46:12,138 --> 00:46:16,959
like, twirl. Yeah, and he's gonna finish off
the twirl by slicing Man-Thing right in half

524
00:46:17,019 --> 00:46:22,001
at the waist. Which, you know, won't kill Man-Thing,
but you know. Yeah, Man-Thing, he just regenerates,

525
00:46:22,081 --> 00:46:28,963
right? Exactly. So, Blade is probably gonna
mouth like, What the fuck? Hahahaha! Just with

526
00:46:29,003 --> 00:46:34,544
like, what was the blood god's name? Like, yeah,
from the movie. Yeah. So meanwhile, nearby

527
00:46:34,604 --> 00:46:39,970
Man-Bat, he's gonna unleash this debilitating
scream at Elsa Bloodstone specifically. just

528
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:45,991
dropping her to her knees. And as she's disoriented,
he's gonna grab her with his talons, just swoop

529
00:46:46,071 --> 00:46:52,173
high above the battle, and just let her go,
just drop her straight down. Okay, um, all

530
00:46:52,193 --> 00:46:56,914
right. As Elsa Bloodstone is falling, she's
gonna throw up a dagger that sticks right into

531
00:46:57,034 --> 00:47:01,896
Manbat's leg, because she's just not pleased
with what he just did to her. And right before

532
00:47:01,916 --> 00:47:06,777
she hits the ground, Doctor Strange is gonna
save her by slowing her descent using the winds

533
00:47:06,797 --> 00:47:12,011
of Watomb. So she's fine. and man bats like
bleeding out from his leg. Oh, awesome, okay.

534
00:47:12,551 --> 00:47:18,754
Meanwhile, Morbius, he'll have snuck behind
Zatanna at this point, and he's gonna attack

535
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:24,797
her, biting her in between her helmet and shoulder
armor, sinking his teeth into her neck. And

536
00:47:24,817 --> 00:47:30,759
this is gonna turn her into a vampire. So her
skin turns white, her eyes glow red, nose flattens,

537
00:47:30,979 --> 00:47:37,858
fangs grow, and she'll now be known as Batanna,
the pseudo-vampiris. Who is basically on the

538
00:47:37,878 --> 00:47:42,360
side of the Midnight Suns against her own team
since she's like a familiar of Morbius I was

539
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:46,482
gonna say, oh thanks for just leveling her up
with like vampire powers But you're saying

540
00:47:46,502 --> 00:47:52,124
she's now under Morbius's command? Not under
his command, but on his side So what she's

541
00:47:52,144 --> 00:47:58,187
gonna do is she's gonna yank Constantine out
of his cowardly hiding spell and from her hat

542
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:04,529
She's gonna pull this like army of vampire rabbits
that just freaking pounce on Constantine and

543
00:48:04,569 --> 00:48:09,909
feast on him They're like biniculas. Yeah, exactly,
like binicula. She pulls out an army of biniculas

544
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:14,672
from her hand now that she's a vampire. That's
kind of cool. But like Constantine, he has

545
00:48:14,712 --> 00:48:19,155
demonic blood, which actually makes him immune
to vampire bites. So these rabbits, they're

546
00:48:19,175 --> 00:48:24,318
just going to like explode upon biting him,
all right? And he's going to pull out this

547
00:48:24,338 --> 00:48:29,922
like vial from his pocket, which is like an
anathema for vampirism. And you're just going

548
00:48:29,942 --> 00:48:35,034
to throw it at Zatanna's feet and it's going
to emit this smoke, like a smoke bomb. that

549
00:48:35,054 --> 00:48:39,876
transforms her back into her normal self. I
mean, would he really have an anathema for

550
00:48:40,036 --> 00:48:45,779
pseudo vampirism? This works on, like, vampirism
of any form. He's prepared for shit like this.

551
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,342
Okay. Meanwhile, Black Orchid, she's going to
be going up against Brother Voodoo, and she's

552
00:48:51,382 --> 00:48:56,025
going to emit these pheromones that control
him into shooting a magic blast at Ghost Rider,

553
00:48:56,245 --> 00:49:00,867
just knocking him straight off of his hell cycle.
Right on his ass. Okay, so it's a lot of teammate

554
00:49:00,907 --> 00:49:06,050
turning on teammate here, huh? Yeah. Well, Brother
Voodoo is, you know, easily manipulated by

555
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:11,453
external forces because within him resides the
spirit of his brother. So Daniel, his brother,

556
00:49:11,493 --> 00:49:16,396
he flies out of his brother and like shakes
him out of this daze that he's in. And brother

557
00:49:16,416 --> 00:49:20,818
Voodoo is able to prevent further pheromone
control on him by using this like special Voodoo

558
00:49:21,038 --> 00:49:26,301
herb mixture that counteracts the pheromones.
And then Daniel the spirit is going to go off

559
00:49:26,481 --> 00:49:32,325
and freaking tackle Deadman thing which pushes
Deadman out of the body. And those two are

560
00:49:32,345 --> 00:49:37,736
just going to start fighting as ghosts. Okay,
okay. And as payback for manipulating Kim,

561
00:49:38,037 --> 00:49:43,761
Brother Voodoo is gonna in return manipulate
Black Orchid. Since she is part plant and he

562
00:49:43,802 --> 00:49:48,846
can command plants, he's gonna like freeze her
in place where she stands as he just strikes

563
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:53,250
her in the head with his staff of legba. Oh,
you mean he strikes her in her magic helmet?

564
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:59,795
Oh yeah, that's stupid magic armor. It's still
around, I gotta get rid of that. Edrigan meanwhile,

565
00:49:59,895 --> 00:50:04,650
he's trying to attack Dr. Strange, just slashing
through. His magic shields laughing and rhyming

566
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:09,032
about how he's gonna feast on his entrails,
you know? Jesus. And finally, he's gonna break

567
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:13,094
through Dr. Strange's defenses and shields,
alright? And Etrigan, he's just gonna bloody

568
00:50:13,154 --> 00:50:17,456
Dr. Strange with his teeth, claws, and superior
strength. Because Etrigan's like Hulk strength,

569
00:50:17,496 --> 00:50:22,097
remember? With magic. Okay, yeah, I think that
would mess Dr. Strange up if he started getting

570
00:50:22,137 --> 00:50:27,880
like pummeled by Etrigan. So he's probably gonna
be near death, but he's gonna raise up his

571
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:33,955
hand, and he's gonna call upon the Spear of
the Seraphim. to just fall from the sky and

572
00:50:34,015 --> 00:50:38,118
impale Edrigan where he stands, like right through
his armor and everything. And since it's from

573
00:50:38,138 --> 00:50:42,782
the Seraphim, you know, Seraphim are angels.
So it's just gonna freaking cause Edrigan to

574
00:50:42,842 --> 00:50:48,487
explode in this bright, holy light that exercises
the demon and sends him back to hell, leaving

575
00:50:48,627 --> 00:50:55,012
just the human, Jason Blood, in his place. And
this holy light explosion is gonna be so powerful

576
00:50:55,392 --> 00:51:00,476
that it's also going to demolish the magic armor
that everybody's wearing. What? Conveniently.

577
00:51:00,817 --> 00:51:05,656
Like what, shatter? Yeah, it's like a angelic
light spear, you know, it carries a big punch.

578
00:51:06,077 --> 00:51:11,821
I feel like that's a really random way to get
rid of the armor, but okay. It's magic. No

579
00:51:11,861 --> 00:51:17,546
question it. Okay. Uh, but by this time Swamp
Thing, he's regrown his body and he's going

580
00:51:17,566 --> 00:51:21,870
to see the vampire Morbius and he's going to
turn his hand into like this wooden stake and

581
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:26,453
he's just going to quickly stretch out his arm,
running the wooden stick right through Morbius'

582
00:51:26,493 --> 00:51:31,317
heart as he was gliding through the air. That
doesn't work on Morbius. He's not a real vampire.

583
00:51:31,337 --> 00:51:36,542
It's. Stakes through the heart don't actually
do anything, nor do holy water or garlic or

584
00:51:36,582 --> 00:51:41,666
things like that. I'm pretty sure getting impaled
would do something to Morbius. I mean it would,

585
00:51:41,706 --> 00:51:45,509
like he'll be out of commission for a bit as
he regenerates his heart using his healing

586
00:51:45,549 --> 00:51:50,894
factor. But you know, he's not out of the match.
And suddenly, like swamp thing, his head freakin'

587
00:51:50,934 --> 00:51:56,218
explodes into shredded lettuce. Because Bloodstone
is gonna unleash two Goliath rounds from her

588
00:51:56,238 --> 00:52:00,874
shotguns at him point blank. Goliath rounds?
Yeah, it's like getting hit with a bus. I guess

589
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:05,716
it's a good thing that Swamp Thing doesn't really
care about that. He'll be fine. Meanwhile,

590
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:12,540
Manbat, he's gonna dive bomb right into Manthing
at full speed, just splattering him into canned

591
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:19,144
spinach. Like all over the battlefield. Oh,
really? Yeah. You do know that Manthing is

592
00:52:19,224 --> 00:52:24,486
full of like, sulfuric acid. So he's like splattered
all over Manbat, meaning Manbat essentially

593
00:52:24,506 --> 00:52:31,262
is just burning himself alive. I take it back!
That was a really dumb move. And then- and

594
00:52:31,302 --> 00:52:35,966
then Man-Thing, he's gonna reform from the splatter,
and Manbat's like, he's done for. He's burned

595
00:52:36,006 --> 00:52:39,889
all over his body, like his flesh is burning
off all over his body, and he's just gonna

596
00:52:39,909 --> 00:52:48,276
finish Manbat off by ripping off Manbat's Manbat-Thing.
What? He's done, he's out. Manbat dies. He

597
00:52:48,296 --> 00:52:54,601
can't survive that. What a way to go. That was
literally like the worst death we've ever had

598
00:52:54,921 --> 00:53:02,006
in any of these team duels. That was so dumb.
Manbat is dead now, but- Meanwhile, Deadman,

599
00:53:02,146 --> 00:53:08,228
using his superior agility, he's gonna evade
this Daniel brother voodoo ghost, and he's

600
00:53:08,248 --> 00:53:14,369
gonna leap into Bloodstone's body, and he's
gonna use her red gem to blast Daniel, like,

601
00:53:14,469 --> 00:53:18,870
out of existence. Okay, yeah, I mean, it's a
magic blast. I think he could do that, yeah.

602
00:53:18,971 --> 00:53:23,912
And then, he's gonna take one of her knives
and use it to slice her own throat, like cutting

603
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:30,454
off the Bloodstone, which causes Morbius to
become, like, overwhelmed with blood drink

604
00:53:30,474 --> 00:53:35,236
her dry, removing bloodstone from the match.
That's messed up. Well, I mean, like Morbius

605
00:53:35,276 --> 00:53:40,078
was regrowing a heart at this time. But I guess
the sight of seeing bloodstone bleed from her

606
00:53:40,138 --> 00:53:45,120
neck would compel him to gather his strength
to go feast on that because he can't help himself.

607
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:49,662
But the bloodstone makes her blood toxic to
vampires. Yeah, it doesn't matter. Dead men

608
00:53:49,722 --> 00:53:55,184
cut that off when he slit her throat, too. So
OK, so Morbius takes out bloodstone, which

609
00:53:55,244 --> 00:53:59,958
is fucked up and like Blade is going to be like
really pissed off. You know, he's not having

610
00:54:00,018 --> 00:54:04,620
any of that shit. That's everything that he
stands against. So Blade would at this point

611
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:10,562
probably kill Morbius for killing Bloodstone.
This is an interesting turn of, I'm gonna allow

612
00:54:10,602 --> 00:54:15,344
this. I'm gonna allow this. I mean, it's what
would happen. I think, so he's gonna chop off

613
00:54:15,384 --> 00:54:20,946
Morbius' head, pick it up and like shove it
in front of Dead Man's face since he can see

614
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:27,049
him, you know, due to the Eye of Agamotto spell.
So Morbius' vampiric eyes, they're gonna mesmerize

615
00:54:27,089 --> 00:54:33,241
Dead Man giving Doctor Strange enough time to
freaking cast Deadman into like the dark dimension.

616
00:54:33,421 --> 00:54:40,947
Deadman's gone. Wait, so Blade decapitated Morbius,
but used his vampiric gaze from his head to

617
00:54:41,148 --> 00:54:46,792
stun Deadman? Yeah, yes, yes. Like, uh, Perseus
did with Medusa. I just recently watched Clash

618
00:54:46,812 --> 00:54:52,677
of the Titans. That may be where I'm getting
this from. Okay, Deadman's gone, but meanwhile,

619
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:58,426
Constantine and Jason Blood, they're gonna be
working together on exercising Xerathos. from

620
00:54:58,486 --> 00:55:04,430
Ghost Rider, who I imagine is back on his bike
and you know is pretty hard to capture, alright?

621
00:55:04,450 --> 00:55:08,753
Yeah. Now Dr. Strange killed Etrigen, but that
just sends Etrigen back to hell, where Jason

622
00:55:08,773 --> 00:55:13,196
Blood can resummon him. So as Constantine is
distracting Ghost Rider, that's what Jason

623
00:55:13,216 --> 00:55:19,000
Blood does. He's like gone, oh form of man.
No, no, no. Before he can even finish this.

624
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:23,202
First of all, the spirit of the Seraphim didn't
just banish Etrigen back to hell, it fucking

625
00:55:23,282 --> 00:55:28,270
destroyed his ass. What? But second of all,
it doesn't matter regardless because... Before

626
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:33,194
Jason Blood can even finish performing this
transformation incantation, he just gets run

627
00:55:33,254 --> 00:55:39,834
over at full speed by Ghost Rider's motorcycle.
He's like, one, two, cheese! It's cold! So

628
00:55:39,894 --> 00:55:45,398
freaking Jason Blood is dead. Wow. And as Ghost
Rider rides past Constantine, he's gonna yank

629
00:55:45,418 --> 00:55:49,301
him by his collar while he's riding. You know,
he's gonna like stand up and surf on his bike

630
00:55:49,541 --> 00:55:53,604
as he's holding onto Constantine, and he's just
gonna peer into his eyes and do the pen and

631
00:55:53,624 --> 00:55:58,888
stare on Constantine, forcing him to relive
all the pain that he's ever caused on others.

632
00:55:59,088 --> 00:56:04,532
For Constantine, that's a lot. So the Hellblazer
is just gonna go out in a blaze of glory, going

633
00:56:04,572 --> 00:56:09,883
to hell for all the shit that he's done, finally.
Yeah, that pen and star would absolutely destroy

634
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:14,686
Constantine. But it's a good thing that's not
Constantine, I guess. Because instead of exploding,

635
00:56:14,866 --> 00:56:20,009
Constantine's skin just like sloughs off like
dead leaves. It was actually Black Orchid pretending

636
00:56:20,049 --> 00:56:26,252
to be Constantine. The real Constantine is actually
nearby, having finished like an exorcism spell

637
00:56:26,492 --> 00:56:32,436
that causes Ghost Rider in his entirety to get
sucked into this tiny vial in Jon's hands with

638
00:56:32,456 --> 00:56:37,715
the Seal of Solomon on it. Boom. Ghost Rider
is out of the match. You just got conned! Why

639
00:56:37,775 --> 00:56:42,978
would the Pennanesther work on Black Orchid?
She's a hero. She's not a criminal. Well, no,

640
00:56:42,998 --> 00:56:47,281
she's done some shit in her past. She's very
mysterious, right? But like even in the comics,

641
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:52,044
like when she was taken over by Hecate, like
she destroyed the Parliament of Tres. She's

642
00:56:52,064 --> 00:56:56,507
done some shit. You can't say she hasn't. But
I mean, that's not really her sins. Like, I

643
00:56:56,527 --> 00:57:00,390
don't think the Pennanesther would actually
kill Black Orchid. No, no, she's not dead.

644
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:07,390
But but she is likely overcome with the fear
and the pain that she's inflicted. And so Man-Thing

645
00:57:07,430 --> 00:57:11,793
is gonna capitalize on it. Since she feels fear,
Man-Thing is just gonna burn her and tear her

646
00:57:11,813 --> 00:57:16,175
to shreds. So Black Orchid's now out of this
match. That's right, because he's attracted

647
00:57:16,195 --> 00:57:20,258
to fear. Well, he's not attracted to it. It
makes him uncomfortable, so he tries to get

648
00:57:20,278 --> 00:57:26,742
rid of it. Okay, so RIP Black Orchid. Meanwhile,
Zatanna and Swamp-Thing, who by this point

649
00:57:26,782 --> 00:57:31,684
has regrown his head, are going toe-to-toe with
Dr. Strange. Now Swamp-Thing, he creates these

650
00:57:31,744 --> 00:57:37,400
duplicates of himself, and together, They manage
to bind Dr. Strange's hands, which allows Zatanna

651
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:43,864
to hit him with this massive energy blast. Well,
Dr. Strange has, like, magical blast resistance,

652
00:57:43,884 --> 00:57:48,588
as it were, you know? So, this magic blast,
I'm gonna say it's not gonna kill him or anything.

653
00:57:48,928 --> 00:57:53,811
If it's really that strong, it'll probably knock
him unconscious. But before he loses consciousness,

654
00:57:54,232 --> 00:57:58,955
he's going to eject his astral form. And he
can still do magic in his astral form. And

655
00:57:59,055 --> 00:58:05,354
in his spirit mode, he's going to recognize
that swamp thing... is essentially also an

656
00:58:05,474 --> 00:58:11,316
astral form just inhabiting this massive plants.
So he's gonna pull out Swamp Thing's spirit.

657
00:58:11,576 --> 00:58:15,157
What's Swamp Thing's real name? Alakolland.
But Swamp Thing isn't actually Alakolland.

658
00:58:15,417 --> 00:58:20,078
It was an entity that thought it was Alakolland
for a time. Well he's gonna pull out that entity

659
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:25,560
and he's gonna take him up onto the astral plane
where Dr. Strange turns into like this giant

660
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:30,721
fiery beast that just burns Swamp Thing and
all of his incarnations and the green itself.

661
00:58:30,781 --> 00:58:35,267
It's just all gonna burn. Dude! Dr. Strange
just fucking killed everybody. If the green

662
00:58:35,327 --> 00:58:39,688
is gone, there's no more plant life. Yeah, just
in the DC universe. That's fine by me. Well,

663
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:45,211
so in the battlefield, no one knows really what's
going on, but the swamp things just disintegrate.

664
00:58:45,491 --> 00:58:49,972
And Dr. Strange's astral form goes back into
his unconscious body. I think Constantine would

665
00:58:49,992 --> 00:58:54,834
have seen what happened, you know, on the astral
plane, because he's psychic, right? So before

666
00:58:54,874 --> 00:58:59,336
Dr. Strange's astral form could return to his
body, Constantine's just gonna perform this

667
00:58:59,436 --> 00:59:05,011
spell that banishes Dr. Strange's astral form.
to hell, like preventing him from returning

668
00:59:05,031 --> 00:59:09,473
to his comatose body and eliminating him from
the match. First of all, Dr. Strange would

669
00:59:09,493 --> 00:59:14,376
go to heaven. So he's trapped in heaven. No,
he went to hell. That's where Constantine sends

670
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:18,879
people. So essentially, Dr. Strange is in the
afterlife now. He's out of this match. Right.

671
00:59:19,239 --> 00:59:24,202
But it would take time for Constantine to invoke
this spell, right? So right after he finishes,

672
00:59:24,542 --> 00:59:30,165
he finds that a glaive has just decapitated
him. Thrown by Blade. What? Yeah. So Constantine's

673
00:59:30,225 --> 00:59:34,327
head falls off. and the glaive returns to blade
like a boomerang and he just catches it like

674
00:59:34,367 --> 00:59:38,579
a badass and like removes his sunglasses and
is like some motherfuckers always trying to

675
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:39,361
ice skate uphill

676
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:47,652
Okay, I did not see Constantine being taken
out with a sword or a glaive, but his trench

677
00:59:47,672 --> 00:59:52,974
coat is demonically possessed All right So upon
Constantine's death it's gonna fly off of his

678
00:59:53,014 --> 00:59:57,876
body and just wraps around blades face and neck
Just smothering and strangling him. Well blade

679
00:59:57,896 --> 01:00:01,978
could just cut that jacket off. No big deal
No, because as blade is trying to cut it off

680
01:00:02,318 --> 01:00:07,660
Zatanna causes all of blades weapons to transform
into like liquid which allows blade to get

681
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:12,638
strangled and he's out of the match What's the
spell for turning blades into liquid? Oh gosh.

682
01:00:14,139 --> 01:00:20,142
Take your time. Nort-ot, do you kill? Something
like that. Okay, so Blade is gone. He's been

683
01:00:20,182 --> 01:00:24,784
smothered to death. But Man-Thing appears behind
Zatanna and just slashes her across her back,

684
01:00:25,025 --> 01:00:30,247
leaving these painful burning slash marks. Okay,
but Zatanna, she's gonna turn around and just

685
01:00:30,287 --> 01:00:36,371
compress Man-Thing's matter into like this crystal
ball. And then she's gonna like lock this crystal

686
01:00:36,411 --> 01:00:41,233
ball in a magic chest that just appears. And
then wrap that chest in like magic chains.

687
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:47,753
And then just cause the whole chest to disappear.
Presto, chain Joe. That was like a pretty elaborate

688
01:00:47,813 --> 01:00:54,097
elimination. She had to get rid of him. And
I think I only have one guy left. Yeah, actually

689
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:58,259
it's just Zatanna and Brother Voodoo now, I
believe. I wasn't even keeping track. So if

690
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:03,843
it's Brother Voodoo versus Zatanna, of all the
magics that Zatanna is well versed in, I bet

691
01:01:03,863 --> 01:01:10,107
you one of them is not necromancy like Brother
Voodoo is. He's gonna raise all of his fallen

692
01:01:10,127 --> 01:01:16,192
comrades, including Blade, Morbius, Bloodstone,
Dr. Strange. They're all gonna come back in

693
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:22,216
zombie form under Brother Voodoo's command.
What? So really, it's Brother Voodoo and the

694
01:01:22,256 --> 01:01:27,040
Marvel zombies against Zatanna. And they're
all just gonna freakin' dogpile on her and

695
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:30,883
feast on her flesh. I mean, she could just set
them on fire before like, any of them even

696
01:01:30,903 --> 01:01:34,830
get close though. That's not how you kill a
zombie, fool. All you did was just turn him

697
01:01:34,870 --> 01:01:39,252
into fire-covered zombies. They're still lurching
forward, they're still tackling, they're still

698
01:01:39,272 --> 01:01:45,014
feasting. Well, little did you know though,
that Zatanna was actually possessed by Deadman

699
01:01:45,094 --> 01:01:49,416
at the time of her death. Because he could teleport
between planes of existence. So when Doctor

700
01:01:49,436 --> 01:01:53,718
Strange banished him, he just came right back
in the nick of time. And since these zombies

701
01:01:53,738 --> 01:01:58,440
have been given new life, Deadman, he's gonna
duplicate himself and take control of each

702
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:03,662
one. Brother Voodoo no longer has any control
of these guys. So they turn on him. Well then

703
01:02:03,942 --> 01:02:08,103
at this point brother Voodoo would just blast
all the zombies heads off and be the last survivor

704
01:02:08,304 --> 01:02:13,326
No, no, cause Deadman is an acrobat He's gonna
use his superior agility to dodge like any

705
01:02:13,346 --> 01:02:18,108
magic blast that brother Voodoo may send at
the zombies to defend himself Acrobatic zombies?

706
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:23,330
What is cooler? So the dead man zombies are
just gonna tear brother Voodoo apart and give

707
01:02:23,370 --> 01:02:28,092
Justice League Dark the win I disagree I think
brother Voodoo kills the zombies and then destroys

708
01:02:28,132 --> 01:02:32,113
dead man using Voodoo giving Midnight Sons the
win Well, let's take it to the stats and see

709
01:02:32,133 --> 01:02:37,018
what happens Alright yeah, either Dead Man Zombies
feast on Brother Voodoo, or Brother Voodoo

710
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:40,589
vanquishes Dead Man. We'll run the simulations
and be right back with the results.

711
01:02:44,898 --> 01:02:49,060
Alright, that was a spooky good time. I always
enjoy these team duel matches. This one got

712
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:53,022
pretty interesting because I felt like there
were a lot of possessions and like forcing

713
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:56,704
other people to do things through magic and
stuff. Yeah, yeah, it got pretty crazy. I think

714
01:02:56,724 --> 01:03:01,287
that's why I kind of lost track of who was still
alive and who was dead. So we ran the simulations.

715
01:03:01,347 --> 01:03:06,290
Basically, when it comes to team duels, we don't
run sets of data against each other. We run

716
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:11,413
matrices. So it's all seven of the Justice League
Dark characters against all seven of the Midnight

717
01:03:11,453 --> 01:03:15,548
Suns characters. Yeah, I was pretty surprised
to see how these stat totals added up. The

718
01:03:15,568 --> 01:03:20,312
teams were pretty even, even though I would
say that these teams specifically, probably

719
01:03:20,352 --> 01:03:24,836
more so than any of our other previous team
duels, had a pretty wide range between like

720
01:03:24,896 --> 01:03:29,981
really powerful characters and really weak characters.
Well, that was also the case for our JSA vs.

721
01:03:30,001 --> 01:03:35,505
Fantastic Four duel, but yeah, same here. Now,
for purposes of balance, when we determine

722
01:03:35,565 --> 01:03:40,089
who's going to fight in these team duels, we
kind of pair characters up against each other.

723
01:03:40,394 --> 01:03:46,796
So the pairings for Justice League Dark vs Midnight
Suns were Zatanna vs Doctor Strange, Constantine

724
01:03:46,816 --> 01:03:52,719
vs Brother Voodoo, Swamp Thing vs Man Thing,
Echigan vs Ghost Rider, Black Orchid vs Bloodstone,

725
01:03:52,979 --> 01:03:57,601
Man Bat vs Amorbius, and Dead Man vs Blade.
But that's just for balance. Every character

726
01:03:57,621 --> 01:04:01,883
is fighting every other character. Looking at
the results, Doctor Strange was definitely

727
01:04:01,923 --> 01:04:08,082
the most powerful character out of both teams.
He won a whopping 84%. of all of his fights.

728
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:13,306
Yeah, he was definitely the most powerful character
out of both teams. But Swamp Thing wasn't too

729
01:04:13,326 --> 01:04:19,610
far behind him as my most powerful character,
winning over 75% of his matches. I only had

730
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:25,134
a total of three characters on the Midnight
Suns who had a win rate above 50%. Besides

731
01:04:25,154 --> 01:04:29,857
Doctor Strange, that was Brother Voodoo and
Ghost Rider. Justice League Dark had a few

732
01:04:29,897 --> 01:04:34,300
more people with an over 50% win rate, including
Swamp Thing, Zatanna, Constantine, and Ettrichin.

733
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:39,163
But you had the lowest win rates as well. Yeah,
Deadman had the lowest win rate, honestly,

734
01:04:39,203 --> 01:04:44,005
because his stats... He's a ghost, his stats
aren't that great. So he only had a win rate

735
01:04:44,065 --> 01:04:48,588
of like less than 15%. And considering he's
going up against a bunch of like magicians

736
01:04:48,628 --> 01:04:52,990
and sorcerers and stuff like that, it kind of
makes sense. And Black Orchid and Manbat didn't

737
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:57,573
fare too much better either, with their win
rates both in the 30s. Your weakest character

738
01:04:57,613 --> 01:05:01,815
was Bloodstone. It was either Bloodstone or
Manthing, they were also both in the 30s. They

739
01:05:01,835 --> 01:05:05,817
were almost tied, basically. Manthing, even
though he's seemingly a powerhouse, he's just

740
01:05:05,877 --> 01:05:10,604
not... very impressive statistically given that
he doesn't really have a mind, you know? But

741
01:05:10,665 --> 01:05:15,328
I have the final results between these two teams
Justice League Dark and Midnight Suns. Who

742
01:05:15,348 --> 01:05:19,871
do you think came out on top? I'm gonna say
I'm gonna say Midnight Suns because both teams

743
01:05:19,891 --> 01:05:25,234
have a large disparity in terms of power levels,
but Dr. Strange is the most powerful statistically.

744
01:05:25,595 --> 01:05:29,397
And plus the Midnight Suns didn't have anyone
as low as Deadman. So since I have the most

745
01:05:29,437 --> 01:05:34,341
powerful and you have the least powerful, I
think I got this. Even though freaking Instagram

746
01:05:34,461 --> 01:05:40,856
doesn't agree On our Instagram poll, two thirds
of the voters, 67%, said that they think Justice

747
01:05:40,897 --> 01:05:45,499
League Dark is gonna win. But I think that's
because the Midnight Suns aren't very popular.

748
01:05:45,819 --> 01:05:49,321
Right, they haven't had a movie like Justice
League Dark has. And their game hasn't come

749
01:05:49,361 --> 01:05:54,845
out yet. Well, let's see how close our Instagram
followers were. The winner of the matchup between

750
01:05:54,925 --> 01:06:03,209
Justice League Dark and the Midnight Suns is
Justice League Dark. No. Yes, psych. They won.

751
01:06:03,682 --> 01:06:13,030
52.3% of the team matches. Wait, how much? 52.3.
523 of the 1000 matches between both teams.

752
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:19,655
So, Midnight Suns won 477. Yes, yeah. I mean,
that's pretty close. I mean, it's like the

753
01:06:19,735 --> 01:06:24,379
least close team duel we've ever done so far,
actually. The rest of them have been closer

754
01:06:24,399 --> 01:06:29,604
than this. Your mom has been closer than this.
That's stupid. That doesn't sound right to

755
01:06:29,644 --> 01:06:34,718
me. Dr. Strange, he's got a... find more powerful
Marvel characters to add to his team next time.

756
01:06:35,058 --> 01:06:39,940
Because although Dr. Strange was the most powerful,
you know, the combined might of Zatanna, Constantine,

757
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:44,281
Swamp Thing, and Etchigan was just too much
for your team to handle. Yeah, I guess Man-Thing,

758
01:06:44,321 --> 01:06:47,742
Bloodstone, Blade, and Morbius were a little
bit lower on the spectrum. But I thought Dr.

759
01:06:47,762 --> 01:06:53,024
Strange could compensate for that. Yeah, I guess
he's the Sorcerer sub-prime. Well, the Justice

760
01:06:53,064 --> 01:06:57,885
League Dark are the Justice League dorks. I
fucking suck. That was bad. That wasn't bad.

761
01:06:58,005 --> 01:07:04,130
I'm pissed off. I got nothing. I'm actually
heartbroken right now because I love Marvel's

762
01:07:04,191 --> 01:07:07,932
supernatural characters. But whatever, I'll
get you on the next team duel. Yeah, that'll

763
01:07:07,952 --> 01:07:12,053
be in April and we're gonna be doing our very
first villain team duels. We're gonna be pitting

764
01:07:12,193 --> 01:07:16,954
Batman's Arkham villains against the Sinister
Six. Right, yeah, and this is gonna piggyback

765
01:07:17,134 --> 01:07:21,955
off of the Spider-Man No Way Home movie, which
we suspect will feature the Sinister Six. So

766
01:07:21,995 --> 01:07:27,577
that'll be a fun one. We're talking like Joker
vs. Green Goblin, Scarecrow vs. Mysterio, Penguin

767
01:07:27,597 --> 01:07:33,711
vs. Vulture, Mr. Freeze vs. Electro. Clayface
vs Sandman, and Bane vs Kraven the Hunter.

768
01:07:34,031 --> 01:07:37,894
Yeah that's gonna be an awesome matchup. I can't
wait for that one. But that does it for this

769
01:07:37,934 --> 01:07:42,396
