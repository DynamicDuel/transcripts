I will announce during that December duel episode.

16
00:01:25,748 --> 00:01:30,818
Which fan base will be the most charitable?
So far it's Marvel. DC guys, let's step up

17
00:01:30,858 --> 00:01:33,804
our game. But with that out of the way, on with
the show.

18
00:01:54,262 --> 00:01:59,266
Hi, welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

19
00:01:59,306 --> 00:02:04,871
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters and stat-based battle simulations.

20
00:02:05,351 --> 00:02:11,136
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous
Joe. And in this episode, we are reviewing

21
00:02:11,516 --> 00:02:17,021
Season 2 of the Disney Plus series, Loki. It
was only six episodes, but they were actually

22
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:22,938
pretty good episodes. Yeah, for my money's worth,
this season was actually the best season. that

23
00:02:22,958 --> 00:02:27,420
Marvel Studios has to offer on the Disney Plus
platform. So stay tuned for that review later

24
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,923
on in this episode. Before that, we have a ton
of news to go over, considering that we didn't

25
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:37,546
break down any news from last week due to my
business trip. But in this episode, we're going

26
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:43,108
to be talking about how Superman Legacy has
cast Lex Luthor, Jimmy Olsen, Eve Tesmacher,

27
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:47,771
and the Engineer. We'll be talking about a bunch
of trailers, including Aquaman and the Lost

28
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:54,166
Kingdom, Madame Web, Justice League Crisis on
Infinite Earths, and Marry Little Batman as

29
00:02:54,226 --> 00:02:58,308
well. Yeah, we're gonna have to speak in our
chipmunk voices, just like speed through it

30
00:02:58,328 --> 00:03:03,630
because this is gonna be a long episode, I feel.
Yeah, as always, we list our segment times

31
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:07,111
in our episode description, so feel free to
check out our show notes if you wanna skip

32
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:11,553
ahead to a particular topic. As our listeners
may know, our duel simulator is so advanced

33
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:16,155
that it's gained sentience and has named itself
the Artificial Lifeform for running extensive

34
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:22,788
duels, just a rather very intelligent simulator
9000, or Alfred Jarvis 9000. He has a quick

35
00:03:22,808 --> 00:03:29,427

Ryōmen Sukuna from Jujutsu Kaisen. This will

50
00:05:07,025 --> 00:05:11,826
be the last episode of the season as Zack is
going to take a break for the month of December.

51
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:17,028
But debuting in December will be the newest
addition to the Dynamite Podcast Network, a

52
00:05:17,068 --> 00:05:23,570
show coming out called Console Combat hosted
by executive producer of this show, John He

53
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,752
and his co-host Dean are going to let you guys
know who'd win in matchups between your favorite

54
00:05:28,052 --> 00:05:34,255
video game characters. Stay tuned for a trailer
of that upcoming show at the end of this podcast.

55
00:05:34,415 --> 00:05:39,877
Yeah, I can't wait for that one. Visit dynamicpodcasts.com
or click the link in our show notes to listen

56
00:05:39,917 --> 00:05:43,879
to all of the shows in the Dynamike Podcast
Network. Real quick, we wanna give a shout

57
00:05:43,899 --> 00:05:48,281
out to patrons Lizzie Dyer Arnie and the Kamacho
Twins. All three of them had their birthdays

58
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:52,284
this past week. Lizzie, if I could give you
anything from Marvel, it would be the ability

59
00:05:52,344 --> 00:05:57,788
to time slip, because getting older just sucks.
And I think it would be cool to travel through

60
00:05:57,828 --> 00:06:02,792
time that way, just like Loki. And I would give
you Wesley Dodd's dreaming power. That way

61
00:06:02,812 --> 00:06:06,995
you can tell the future and see if you want
to travel there. And for the Kamacho twins,

62
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:09,677
if I could give you anything from the world
of Marvel, I'm trying to think of the most

63
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:15,201
prominent twins in Marvel. Probably Scarlet
Witch and Quicksilver. So one of you gets reality

64
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:19,355
warping powers. and one of you gets super speed.
I'll let you guys pick which one gets which.

65
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:25,258
And in honor of the Wonder Twins, I would give
you, Scott, the power to turn into any animal

66
00:06:25,578 --> 00:06:32,581
and Gilly, you get the ability to turn into
a bucket of water. Cause you like Marvel. The

67
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:37,783
Marvel powers are just so much better. Happy
birthday guys, thanks for being patrons. Happy

68
00:06:37,803 --> 00:06:44,858
birthday. But with that out of the way, quick
to the no prize. The No Prize is an award Marvel

69
00:06:44,898 --> 00:06:49,799
used to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic
Duel No Prize, is a digital award that we post

70
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,301
on Instagram and in our email newsletter for
the person that we feel gave the best answer

71
00:06:54,341 --> 00:07:00,122
to our question of the week. So two weeks ago,
we asked what other characters from the Sandman

72
00:07:00,222 --> 00:07:05,304
universe do you hope get their own series on
Netflix? And this was a tie in to the first

73
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:10,665
trailer that we got for the Dead Boy Detective's
Netflix series, which itself is a supposed

74
00:07:10,705 --> 00:07:15,372
tie in. to the Sandman universe that they've
established on that streaming platform. You

75
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:21,997
guys had two weeks to answer and we got two
answers. That just means it wasn't a great

76
00:07:22,037 --> 00:07:27,700
question. I will say that one of the answers
was unusable because whoever called it in whispered

77
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,204
the entire time pretending to be Batman and
it just could not be understood. But between

78
00:07:33,504 --> 00:07:36,626
the two answers that were understandable, one
of them gets an honorable mention and the other

79
00:07:36,686 --> 00:07:42,718
one gets no prize win. So our honorable mention
goes to Lizzie Dyer Arnie. Who said? Hey, it's

80
00:07:42,758 --> 00:07:47,220
Lizzie. No contest here. If Sandman character
gets her own spinoff, it's gotta be my boy

81
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:52,782
Wesley Dodds, aka Sandman Mystery Theater. It's
the greatest comic you've never read. I like

82
00:07:52,802 --> 00:07:59,505
to describe it as Batman meets SVU. It's set
in the 1930s. I think it would attract fans

83
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:05,667
of shows like Boardwalk Empire and the now canceled
Perry Mason. You know, what's HBO's loss could

84
00:08:05,687 --> 00:08:11,662
be Netflix's gain. Yeah. So Sandman Mystery
Theater was a vertigo comic book. It was the

85
00:08:11,722 --> 00:08:17,024
same imprint that also published the Sandman
comics, and it was established that Wesley

86
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:23,226
Dodds, the original Golden Age Sandman, received
dreams from Morpheus. The comic was very, very

87
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:28,129
detective noir, and I think it would translate
fantastically into a show, especially the way

88
00:08:28,209 --> 00:08:32,951
Lizzie described it. Yeah, I always liked the
JSA character of Sandman. A lot of people kind

89
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:38,933
of maybe write him off as just a guy with a
sleeping gas gun and a gas mask, but kind of

90
00:08:38,973 --> 00:08:43,915
similar to the question. there's a lot more
going on there than first impressions may imply.

91
00:08:44,035 --> 00:08:47,936
I think he's a fascinating character. Yeah,
he's a great like pulpy character, sort of

92
00:08:47,976 --> 00:08:51,677
like the green hornet or the shadow. I feel
like there's a lot that they could do with

93
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:56,318
the character on screen that they just haven't
done yet. Yeah, especially as a period piece

94
00:08:56,539 --> 00:09:01,540
as Lizzie described it. For sure. So great answer
Lizzie, but the winner of this week's No Prize

95
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,682
is Luke Tucker, who said, Hey guys, this is
Luke. I think they should make a death spinoff

96
00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:12,605
series with the premise being based on the line
that she tells Dream in the comics about how

97
00:09:12,645 --> 00:09:16,427
she'll put the chairs on the table, turn off
the lights, and lock the door to the universe

98
00:09:16,487 --> 00:09:20,810
once the last living thing dies. The series
could follow her through time, witnessing the

99
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:25,513
past, present, and the future, with the ending
of the series being her witnessing the last

100
00:09:25,553 --> 00:09:30,355
living thing die and locking the door to the
universe as everything passes on. Thanks, guys.

101
00:09:30,896 --> 00:09:37,143
So if you had the chance to listen to my guest
spot, on the Mad Trivia podcast. You know that

102
00:09:37,283 --> 00:09:42,306
I love existential film. And this sounds like
the most existential series that could ever

103
00:09:42,346 --> 00:09:47,049
be made. Yeah, especially how Luke describes
it where we witness her travel through time.

104
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:52,472
You know, the episode that involved death in
the Sandman Netflix series was one of my favorite

105
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:55,814
episodes because we got to see Dream, like,
you know, travel through time, through the

106
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:59,656
centuries, and I just thought that was fascinating.
Yeah, honestly, I don't even know if you need

107
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:04,127
to necessarily follow death. Like she's obviously
like a recurring character, but I think it

108
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:08,311
could be almost like an anthology series just
telling stories about these people on their

109
00:10:08,371 --> 00:10:13,615
last days, you know, before they die. Sort of
like the animated short that we got for death.

110
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:17,638
It just told the last day of this artist. Yeah,
of course she would show up at the end of every

111
00:10:17,678 --> 00:10:22,722
episode. Exactly. Yeah, that sounds perfect.
So fantastic answer, Luke Tucker. You win this

112
00:10:22,762 --> 00:10:26,946
week's No Prize. If listeners want a shot at
winning their own No Prize, stay tuned to later

113
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:31,469
on in this episode when we'll be asking another
Question of the Week. And now that that's done...

114
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:32,957
On to the news!

115
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:44,926
Okay, so these past two weeks we've gotten a
slew of casting news for Superman Legacy thanks

116
00:10:44,966 --> 00:10:49,990
to The Actor's Strike, which ended a few weeks
earlier. We've been expecting this for quite

117
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:56,294
a few films and I'm really excited to say that
it looks like, according to Deadline, Nicholas

118
00:10:56,354 --> 00:11:03,139
Holt has been cast as Lex Luthor for the movie.
Of course, he was up for the role of Superman,

119
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:09,131
but he lost out on that role to David Cornsweat.
A lot of people were fan-casting him as a potential

120
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:14,293
Lex Luthor because he has this great sort of
like villainous look to him, I think. But I'm

121
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:19,155
super excited about this news. Oh, it's fantastic
casting. He's had some villainous turns in

122
00:11:19,295 --> 00:11:24,957
other movies, like the menu. He wasn't really
a villain so much as a weirdo in that movie.

123
00:11:24,997 --> 00:11:30,979
But yeah, he can play a fantastic Dastardly
character and especially opposite David Cornsweat.

124
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,281
I think this is brilliant. I really can't wait
to see it. I think he'll be the best Lex Luthor

125
00:11:35,301 --> 00:11:40,171
we've gotten. since Gene Hackman. Oh yeah, I
think he's gonna be the best Lex Luthor we've

126
00:11:40,191 --> 00:11:45,073
ever had. And I said the same thing for Rachel
Brosnahan as Lois Lane. The casting choices

127
00:11:45,113 --> 00:11:51,516
that they're making for this film are just absolutely
perfect. Including the news that Skyler Gazzando

128
00:11:51,796 --> 00:11:59,660
is playing Jimmy Olsen. He looks the role to
a T. Holy crap. I saw him in the vacation reboot,

129
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,102
sequel, recue. He was pretty good in that one.
I could totally see him in this role. Great

130
00:12:04,122 --> 00:12:08,864
comedic actor, I hope they make Jamie Olsen
a comedic character. And since it's a James

131
00:12:08,904 --> 00:12:12,966
Gunn film and he tends to be, you know, more
comedic with his films like Guardians of the

132
00:12:12,986 --> 00:12:16,587
Galaxy, I bet that's what the role is going
to be. And I bet Skyler is going to knock it

133
00:12:16,607 --> 00:12:21,990
out of the park because he's great. We also
got news that Sarah Sampayo is going to be

134
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:27,812
Eve Tessmacher, who anyone who's seen the Superman
film directed by Richard Donner in the 70s

135
00:12:27,973 --> 00:12:32,342
knows that she's Lex Luthor's girlfriend. I'm
actually kind of surprised she's in this movie

136
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,604
and I'm not quite sure what route they're gonna
take with the character. Like, are they gonna

137
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:39,745
make her like a badass, like Mercy Graves or
something like that? Or are they gonna make

138
00:12:39,786 --> 00:12:44,468
her more comedic, sort of like that first Superman
movie? It's almost like the Superman legacy

139
00:12:44,488 --> 00:12:49,290
movie is going to pay homage to Superman, the
movie from the 70s. Yeah, that is interesting.

140
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:55,132
In our last bit of casting news, we also learned
that Maria Gabriella de Feria, a Venezuelan

141
00:12:55,212 --> 00:13:01,604
actress, is going to play the role of the engineer.
Now the Engineer is a character who is a member

142
00:13:01,644 --> 00:13:06,708
of the Authority from the Wildstorm comics.
She is a robotic type character. Her body is

143
00:13:06,748 --> 00:13:12,753
made up of nanobots and it's rumored that she's
actually like a sub-villain for the larger

144
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:18,718
threat that will be posed by Brainiac. Hopefully
that's the case because I think a lot of people

145
00:13:18,738 --> 00:13:22,481
are rooting for Brainiac to be the villain of
this movie considering he's like probably the

146
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:29,163
biggest Superman villain that has yet to appear
in a Superman live-action movie. early stories

147
00:13:29,203 --> 00:13:32,891
and his origin and stuff like that, it seems
almost like a no-brainer to go with him. Yeah,

148
00:13:32,951 --> 00:13:38,021
definitely low-hanging fruit there. I really
hope Brainiac is in the movie. And that brings

149
00:13:38,082 --> 00:13:39,384
us to our question of the week.

150
00:13:43,762 --> 00:13:49,686
If Brainiac is the villain in Superman Legacy,
who would you cast as the character, and why?

156
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:17,651
great casting choices, perfect casting choices.
In my opinion, I can't wait to see what James

157
00:14:17,671 --> 00:14:24,413
Gunn is going to do with Superman Legacy, which
comes out July 11th, 2025. Before that, we've

158
00:14:24,433 --> 00:14:29,415
got Aquaman coming out this December, for which
tickets just went on sale and Warner Brothers

159
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:34,616
has released a trailer to coincide with that.
It's a short trailer. It's only a minute and

160
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:39,718
30 seconds long, but there's a lot of new footage
that we haven't seen in prior trailers. It

161
00:14:39,758 --> 00:14:44,860
starts off with Aquaman talking to his infant
son, who's communicating with Goldfish in a

162
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:49,302
tank. It's pretty adorable, honestly. But we
learned through the course of this trailer

163
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:55,865
that the key to Black Manta accessing this super
powerful army to fight against Aquaman and

164
00:14:55,905 --> 00:15:03,348
Atlantis is the royal bloodline, of which Aquababy
is the last member. Right, so it looks like

165
00:15:03,468 --> 00:15:09,084
Black Manta kidnaps Aquababy. from Aquaman's
father's lighthouse and I think they can't

166
00:15:09,124 --> 00:15:13,008
be more blatant that this baby is gonna die.
Which would be super tragic because it's a

167
00:15:13,068 --> 00:15:18,592
cute baby. We know that James Wan doesn't really
hold back when it comes to, you know, violence.

168
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:23,917
Yeah, I mean the movie looks amazing. You know,
everything from the Dead King to Black Manta

169
00:15:24,317 --> 00:15:28,581
to all the Underwater battles between Aquaman
and Black Manta that we're gonna see. It looks

170
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:34,250
breathtaking as usual. I'm not surprised there
and I really can't wait to see the movie. December

171
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:41,133
22nd. I already have my tickets. Do you? No.
Well, get them. It's the end of an era, people.

172
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:46,655
This is the last film in the DCEU. Allegedly.
I don't know. According to Jason Momoa, it

173
00:15:46,715 --> 00:15:50,037
is. Yeah, the trailer's pretty good. It looks
like it's gonna be a good movie. You know what

174
00:15:50,057 --> 00:15:56,540
it looks like is not gonna be a good movie and
was a shitty trailer? Madame Webb? How do you

175
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:02,686
like that transition? I liked it a lot. God,
this... Sony does not know what the hell they're

176
00:16:02,726 --> 00:16:08,888
doing. This past week, we got the first official
trailer for Madame Web, and it looks about

177
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:15,530
as bad as we were all thinking it would be.
Dakota Johnson plays apparently Cassandra Webb.

178
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,431
We thought she was playing Julia Carpenter,
because her version of Madame Web looks exactly

179
00:16:19,451 --> 00:16:24,292
like the Julia Carpenter version from the comics.
But Sydney Sweeney, one of the actresses in

180
00:16:24,312 --> 00:16:29,282
this movie, is actually playing Julia Carpenter,
one of the Spider Women. So... Yeah, I think

181
00:16:29,442 --> 00:16:33,225
Dakota Johnson is playing Cassandra Webb. She,
of course, has the power of premonition like

182
00:16:33,245 --> 00:16:37,768
she does in the comics, but it plays out in
the course of this trailer, like an iteration

183
00:16:37,809 --> 00:16:42,432
of the Final Destination franchise, where she
sees all this horrible stuff happen and then

184
00:16:42,452 --> 00:16:47,776
she's able to prevent it from happening through
her powers. It's like Final Destination with

185
00:16:47,856 --> 00:16:53,360
a little bit of crime talk day. Yeah, a little
bit. We learned that Madam Webb was a paramedic

186
00:16:53,501 --> 00:16:58,220
alongside Uncle Ben. who's played by Adam Scott
in this movie. She has a near-death experience,

187
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,704
which I guess ties her into the web of life
and destiny, where she can see the future.

188
00:17:03,324 --> 00:17:09,029
And she basically witnesses this crazy guy with
spider powers kill these three girls who also

189
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:14,454
have spider powers. Now, the villain of this
movie is going to be a character named Ezekiel,

190
00:17:14,474 --> 00:17:19,998
who was introduced in the J. Michael Straczynski
run in the Spider-Man comics. He is basically

191
00:17:20,118 --> 00:17:25,410
a guy with spider powers that he received in
a ritual in the jungle. and he tells Peter

192
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:31,194
Parker Spider-Man all about the spider totem
and how every character that has an animal-based

193
00:17:31,214 --> 00:17:36,657
ability is tied into the animalistic totem and
some totems feed on others and there's also

194
00:17:36,937 --> 00:17:42,501
this vampiric race of beings known as the Inheritors
of which a character called Moralune is a part

195
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:48,644
of that feeds off of these totems. It makes
no sense for the character of Ezekiel to be

196
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:53,800
attacking these women as he is. It also makes
no sense for him to dress up in this dark Spider-Man

197
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,503
outfit. Uh, what the fuck is that? I mean, is
that Ezekiel in the Spider-Man outfit? I don't

198
00:17:58,523 --> 00:18:04,407
know. Or is the black Spider-Man guy a version
of Morlun, the inheritor? I don't know what's

199
00:18:04,427 --> 00:18:09,391
going on here, but it all looks really bad and
a horrible way to introduce elements from the

200
00:18:09,431 --> 00:18:15,695
Spider-Man universe into a film. I mean, yeah,
the movie looks bad, but also doesn't look

201
00:18:15,915 --> 00:18:21,519
bad regarding the cinematography. I actually
liked that. Well, you are the only one in that.

202
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:25,743
Really? Sure. I mean, like the cinematography
is fine. It looks like a movie, right? What

203
00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:31,348
what's special about the cinematography here,
Jonathan? The women look good and well lit

204
00:18:31,368 --> 00:18:37,273
in their costumes. I actually thought the girls
look a little bit silly in their costumes.

205
00:18:37,433 --> 00:18:42,157
So we have here Julia Carpenter, who was a character
called Spider Woman in the comics. She was

206
00:18:42,177 --> 00:18:46,741
actually the Spider Woman in the Secret Wars
event, who eventually in the comics became.

207
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:51,648
her own version of Madame Web after Cassandra
Web died. She's played by Sydney Sweeney. We

208
00:18:51,688 --> 00:18:56,736
also have Anya Corazon here. She got her powers
from the Spider Society, which was founded

209
00:18:56,876 --> 00:19:01,663
by Ezekiel as a- I didn't know she was in the
movie, actually. I saw her and I was like,

210
00:19:01,703 --> 00:19:08,415
what is Hawk Girl doing in this movie? That's
right. Yeah. Because Isabella Mercer, it was

211
00:19:08,475 --> 00:19:12,676
also cast in Superman Legacy as Hawk Girl. So
it looks like she is pulling double duty for

212
00:19:12,696 --> 00:19:18,039
both Marvel and DC. Yeah. And the third lady
is Maddie Franklin. She's also Spider Woman

213
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:22,620
and she has the spider legs that sprout from
her back, just like in the comic books. It's

214
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:28,843
all very strange to see these essentially D-less
characters in this film. I hope it doesn't

215
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:34,045
really dilute the brand or confuse audiences
as to what the hell is going on regarding the

216
00:19:34,065 --> 00:19:38,868
character of Spider-Man. This whole string of
movies that plays within the Spider-Man universe

217
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:43,552
without actually showing the character of Spider-Man
is just getting ridiculous now. And I think

218
00:19:44,113 --> 00:19:48,496
seeing these Spider-Women characters within
this trailer serves to highlight that. It's

219
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:52,880
weird having them without actually Spider-Man
showing up. And especially when you have the

220
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,104
villain dressing up like Spider-Man. That's
so weird. Yeah, that was weird. But I mean,

221
00:19:57,624 --> 00:20:02,708
honestly, Spider-Man could show up in this movie.
It's not out of the realm of possibility, but

222
00:20:02,748 --> 00:20:07,631
I bet you he's not gonna. At the very best you'll
get like a cameo from Morbius or Venom or something

223
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:13,975
like that. It's Morbin time. The trailer does
show some of the action, which looks pretty

224
00:20:13,995 --> 00:20:18,157
good. To me, it just looks very much like Final
Destination where essentially we'll see an

225
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:22,199
entire scene play out and then it turns out,
oh, that entire thing that just happened was

226
00:20:22,239 --> 00:20:26,822
a premonition. This is how it's really going
to play out. I recently saw the film Suspiria

227
00:20:27,002 --> 00:20:30,984
over Halloween. I was watching a bunch of scary
movies and that was actually the first time

228
00:20:31,024 --> 00:20:34,966
I've ever seen Dakota Johnson in a role because
I never saw. 50 Shades of Grey. Gosh, she's

229
00:20:35,066 --> 00:20:39,268
not that great of an actress. If you thought
her line delivery within this trailer was a

230
00:20:39,308 --> 00:20:44,731
little bit stiff, expect more, I'll say, when
the movie actually comes out. Yeah, I mean,

231
00:20:44,971 --> 00:20:50,654
I'm not expecting any Oscars for this film,
except for maybe costume design. I doubt that.

232
00:20:51,135 --> 00:20:56,417
But we'll find out when the movie comes out
in February. Moving on to the animated trailers.

233
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:01,934
We got the first Justice League Crisis on Infinite
Earths trailer, which apparently is going to

234
00:21:01,954 --> 00:21:06,819
kick off a trilogy of films that are coming
out next year. Now, the trailer is titled the

235
00:21:06,859 --> 00:21:11,583
official trilogy trailer, so I'm not sure how
much of the footage from it comes from just

236
00:21:11,723 --> 00:21:16,728
part one of the trilogy, or if it spans more
than that. Crisis on Infinite Earths part one,

237
00:21:17,048 --> 00:21:21,752
of course, takes place immediately following
the events of Justice League Warworld, which

238
00:21:21,812 --> 00:21:27,487
we reviewed recently. and which was not great.
Actually a lot of the recent movies set in

239
00:21:27,507 --> 00:21:33,848
the animated Tomorrow vs Universe, which this
trilogy will take place, are not good I would

240
00:21:33,908 --> 00:21:38,550
say. So I can't say that I'm looking forward
to it and I can't really say that this trailer

241
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:42,911
did anything for me. Honestly, I'm probably
looking forward to it even less because of

242
00:21:42,951 --> 00:21:48,252
this trailer. Particularly because there was
an issue we mentioned in Justice Society World

243
00:21:48,292 --> 00:21:57,715
War 2 that also appears to be happening in Barry
Allen has no nose when he's in profile It just

244
00:21:57,735 --> 00:22:04,057
bothers me That's just nitpicking. I think really
the reason why this trailer did nothing for

245
00:22:04,077 --> 00:22:08,078
you is because it doesn't give a clear idea
Of what the story is actually we see a lot

246
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:13,340
of shots of dramatic things happening such as
worlds disappearing and stuff But without the

247
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,241
stories context, it feels like there's no real
emotional stakes tied to any of this. Hopefully

248
00:22:18,301 --> 00:22:24,809
we get a true trailer for part one of this trilogy
that'll shed some light on exactly what's going

249
00:22:24,889 --> 00:22:29,252
on here. Yeah, it does look like Barry Allen
and Supergirl are going to be playing large

250
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:33,515
roles in this trilogy, which makes sense considering,
you know, they had major roles in the comic

251
00:22:33,555 --> 00:22:38,338
book version. We don't have a release date yet
for any of the three films, though we do know

252
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:43,321
that all three will be coming out next year.
And you know, we'll be reviewing them once

253
00:22:43,341 --> 00:22:48,351
they do come out. This past week we also got
a trailer for What If Season 2 which features

254
00:22:48,431 --> 00:22:54,273
a very different style of animation. Some would
say better and they would be correct. Especially

255
00:22:54,293 --> 00:22:59,954
when you watch the two trailers for DC's Crisis
on Infinite Earths and What If Season 2, you

256
00:22:59,975 --> 00:23:03,416
can tell right off the bat that Disney's bringing
their A-game when it comes to the animation.

257
00:23:03,896 --> 00:23:10,546
Uh, okay. I loved this What If Season 2 trailer.
I thought it looked really good. Visually at

258
00:23:10,586 --> 00:23:14,788
least, I don't know if the stories that it tells
are going to be any better than season one

259
00:23:15,249 --> 00:23:20,311
But we're gonna get some pretty cool concepts
here at the very least including a early version

260
00:23:20,451 --> 00:23:27,575
of the Avengers Which seems to include Captain
Mar-Vell, the Winter Soldier, Ant-Man and T'Chaka,

261
00:23:27,915 --> 00:23:33,038
Black Panther's father That looks like it'll
be pretty cool But we also get a scene of Hela

262
00:23:33,418 --> 00:23:39,842
and the Asgardians going up against Wenwu and
his ten rings We see strange Supreme make a

263
00:23:39,882 --> 00:23:45,886
return from season one as well as Captain Carter.
They're gonna continue those stories, those

264
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:50,329
being some of the better episodes from season
one. But most importantly, and the thing I'm

265
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:55,433
most excited to see, is that there appears to
be an episode that focuses on a race on the

266
00:23:55,453 --> 00:24:02,437
planet of Sakaar that involves Iron Man in some
kind of like Hulkbuster racing car, Gamora,

267
00:24:02,938 --> 00:24:07,901
Valkyrie. It looks like something straight out
of Mad Max, and it's gonna be an absolute blast,

268
00:24:07,941 --> 00:24:13,513
it seems. The action looks incredible. Yeah,
that episode looks like it's gonna be pretty

269
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:18,418
good, not gonna lie. It looks like some of the
episodes rehash the events from Infinity War,

270
00:24:18,938 --> 00:24:25,584
and one of them is going to be about Happy Hogan
in a die-hard Christmas-type situation, which

271
00:24:25,624 --> 00:24:29,667
is gonna be a lot of fun. That episode is actually
gonna drop on Christmas Day. What's really

272
00:24:29,687 --> 00:24:34,471
interesting is that, actually, the first episode
of season two is gonna drop on December 22nd,

273
00:24:34,851 --> 00:24:39,619
and then we're gonna get one episode a day every
day. until the end of the year, which is a

274
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:43,843
new method of releasing episodes for Disney
Plus, but I'm looking forward to it. I think

275
00:24:43,863 --> 00:24:48,686
it'll be a fun kind of holiday break where it's
like we get to unwrap a new What If present

276
00:24:48,747 --> 00:24:54,051
every day. Yeah, it's like a advent calendar
in a way. Yeah. Of course, our review for What

277
00:24:54,071 --> 00:24:59,996
If Season Two isn't going to drop until early
2024. Yeah, in January, but What If Season

278
00:25:00,036 --> 00:25:05,780
Two will be incorporated into our 2023 Brothers
Awards. It will be in consideration for those

279
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:11,507
awards. As will... Merry Little Batman, which
is an animated film that will be premiering

280
00:25:11,707 --> 00:25:17,469
on Amazon Prime on December 8th. I wasn't sure
if we were going to review this, but after

281
00:25:17,489 --> 00:25:22,630
seeing this trailer, I'm like, we got it, because
this just looks like the cutest, most fun holiday

282
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:29,072
Batman film ever. The thing that actually appeals
to me the most is the animation style. Again,

283
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:34,013
all three of these animated trailers that we're
discussing have very different animation styles.

284
00:25:34,538 --> 00:25:41,080
But Merry Little Batman is definitely the most
unique and the most cartoony, and very much

285
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,742
in keeping with the kind of lighthearted style
of the story that is trying to tell it seems.

286
00:25:46,243 --> 00:25:50,585
Yeah, it's a kid's story that centers around
Damien Wayne, who tries to take up the mantle

287
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:56,147
of Batman while his father is away during Christmas.
The fact that the Joker is trying to steal

288
00:25:56,207 --> 00:26:02,614
Christmas in Gotham is fantastic. Like, I know
they stole that from The Grinch. But I can't

289
00:26:02,654 --> 00:26:07,215
wait to see that play out on screen, because
the Joker is, you know, pretty much a Grinch.

290
00:26:09,836 --> 00:26:13,257
It looks like the film is going to be filled
with a ton of cute jokes. You know, whether

291
00:26:13,297 --> 00:26:18,158
they're talking about donut crumbs and Batman's
beard, or the Joker asking who gave the little

292
00:26:18,178 --> 00:26:22,899
kid explosives. Honestly, I'm really looking
forward to seeing this movie with my own children.

293
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:30,841
Yeah, it kind of looks like the Grinch meets
Home Alone meets Batman. What? Sold. Cannot

294
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:35,383
be more sold. Honestly I don't want to like
this trailer because it's DC but every time

295
00:26:35,463 --> 00:26:39,831
I watch it puts a smile on my face so I think
it'll be a great time this holiday season.

296
00:26:40,271 --> 00:26:44,258
If you guys have Amazon Prime definitely check
it out and definitely check out a review of

297
00:26:44,318 --> 00:26:46,421
it after it drops December 8th.

298
00:26:53,806 --> 00:26:57,893
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode. Holy cow, that was a lot. Now

299
00:26:57,913 --> 00:27:03,323
let's move on to the main event, where we review
season two of the Marvel Studios television

300
00:27:03,363 --> 00:27:04,545
series, Loki.

301
00:27:19,882 --> 00:27:25,607
Okay, Loki Season 2 was directed by Justin Benson
and Aaron Moorhead and stars Tom Hiddleston,

302
00:27:25,827 --> 00:27:31,372
Owen Wilson, Sofia DiMartino, and Jonathan Majors.
The season immediately continues the story

303
00:27:31,392 --> 00:27:36,977
of Loki Season 1, so right up top, I'm gonna
give you guys your spoiler warning. Don't hurt

304
00:27:37,017 --> 00:27:42,882
yourself by listening to this review before
watching Loki Season 2, which is incredible,

305
00:27:43,263 --> 00:27:48,603
I highly recommend it, and don't skip Loki Season
1 either. So spoiler warning for that season

306
00:27:48,823 --> 00:27:54,086
in this review as well. Yeah, if you haven't
seen Loki season one, definitely do so. It's

307
00:27:54,127 --> 00:27:59,830
fantastic. This is coming from a DC guy. In
my opinion, Loki is the best thing that Marvel's

308
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:06,975
put out on the Disney Plus platform. I don't
disagree for sure. In season one, the Loki

309
00:28:07,015 --> 00:28:12,119
variant from Avengers Endgame was arrested by
the Time Variance Authority whose job it is

310
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:17,430
to eliminate branches to what they refer to
as the Sacred Timeline. Along the way, he met

311
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:21,713
another Loki variant named Sylvie, and the two
worked together to uncover the mystery behind

312
00:28:21,733 --> 00:28:28,758
the TVA and the man who created it, a Kang variant
named He Who Remains. Sylvie killed He Who

313
00:28:28,798 --> 00:28:35,142
Remains, resulting in a branching Marvel multiverse,
and sent Loki back to the TVA. That's the most

314
00:28:35,222 --> 00:28:41,198
basic of recaps for season 1. We rated it 4
stars on this podcast when it came out. Basically,

315
00:28:41,438 --> 00:28:45,301
I remember saying everything about that season
was amazing, the only thing I didn't like was

316
00:28:45,321 --> 00:28:49,724
that I felt the character of Loki lost some
of his agency to Sylvie, who it seemed really

317
00:28:49,744 --> 00:28:55,428
took on the protagonist role. But the same could
not be said of this season too, where Loki

318
00:28:55,568 --> 00:29:01,393
is front and center, supported by a strong cast
of characters, including Sylvie and Mobius,

319
00:29:01,633 --> 00:29:06,416
and a great new addition named Ouroboros played
by Kei-Hui Kuan. I really like this season.

320
00:29:06,676 --> 00:29:11,304
Even more than I liked the first season. And
I agree, I think this is unequivocally Marvel

321
00:29:11,324 --> 00:29:16,008
Studios best series to date. I'm not sure if
I liked this season more than last season,

322
00:29:16,348 --> 00:29:21,413
but I think it's a worthy successor, I guess
you could say, to season one, which I think

323
00:29:21,433 --> 00:29:27,338
is probably the most important thing that Marvel
Studios has put out story-wise after Avengers

324
00:29:27,438 --> 00:29:32,562
Endgame. Yeah, for sure. It really kicked off
the multiversal saga, at least like the reasoning

325
00:29:32,622 --> 00:29:37,883
behind the Marvel multiverse, right? Season
one was great. this season, yeah, I think is

326
00:29:38,083 --> 00:29:41,847
a worthy successor. I think it does a great
job of picking up the pieces where the story

327
00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:48,133
left off. And plus the show is just an audio
visual masterpiece, I think. Holy cow. The

328
00:29:48,193 --> 00:29:53,558
cinematography, the art direction and the production
design is all top tier. It's phenomenal, just

329
00:29:53,598 --> 00:29:58,102
like it was in season one where everything is
gorgeous and often even better looking than

330
00:29:58,162 --> 00:30:03,979
the theatrical films that Marvel Studios produces.
No, I agree. Sometimes I think that the Marvel

331
00:30:04,019 --> 00:30:09,504
films get a little too candy-coated in terms
of the cinematography. Loki is something that

332
00:30:09,584 --> 00:30:14,388
definitely shines in terms of cinematography
in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yeah, if

333
00:30:14,408 --> 00:30:19,372
you describe the Marvel Studios theatrical films
as being kind of candy-coated, like the Marvels,

334
00:30:19,513 --> 00:30:24,637
like Guardians of the Galaxy 3, like Ant-Man
Quantumania, I would describe the Loki television

335
00:30:24,657 --> 00:30:29,741
series as being like antique bronze-coated.
It just has that feel. Yeah, yeah, I can see

336
00:30:29,781 --> 00:30:36,394
that. Or like a rich leather and mahogany finish.
Yeah, it just looks different from everything

337
00:30:36,474 --> 00:30:41,517
else. They did a fantastic job of sticking to
a very specific color palette throughout the

338
00:30:41,557 --> 00:30:46,140
show. And I just couldn't take my eyes off the
screen the whole time. It was just gorgeous.

339
00:30:46,821 --> 00:30:51,003
The show sounds great, too, with one of the
most unique and atmospheric scores out of any

340
00:30:51,124 --> 00:30:56,988
media, honestly, film or television series masterfully
composed by Natalie Holt, who I kind of feel

341
00:30:57,008 --> 00:31:00,854
like came out of nowhere, starting with Loki
season one a few years ago. to become one of

342
00:31:00,894 --> 00:31:06,858
the most compelling artists in her craft currently.
Oh yeah, I love the synthetic score that they

343
00:31:06,878 --> 00:31:11,381
have for Loki. It's so damn good. I think we
mentioned in our review of season one that

344
00:31:11,421 --> 00:31:14,944
it just reminds me of something from, I don't
know, like Clockwork Orange or something like

345
00:31:14,984 --> 00:31:19,807
that. Yeah. There's something dated, but it
works really well with the tone of the show.

346
00:31:20,247 --> 00:31:25,111
Yeah, it's atmospheric, it's slightly eerie,
but above all things, it's interesting. So

347
00:31:25,131 --> 00:31:29,786
you have the audio, you have the visuals, and
the direction by Benson and Moorhead. really

348
00:31:29,826 --> 00:31:34,607
well done here. They didn't work on the first
season of Loki, but they did direct some of

349
00:31:34,627 --> 00:31:38,928
the episodes of Moon Knight, which is also one
of Marvel Studios' most cinematic feeling shows.

350
00:31:39,449 --> 00:31:43,850
And I think they have a great command of the
camera and storytelling sense to pull the most

351
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:49,592
emotion and shock and coolness from a scene.
We know Matt Shackman is going to direct the

352
00:31:49,652 --> 00:31:54,813
Fantastic Four film for Marvel Studios. He was
hired for that based on his work on the WandaVision

353
00:31:54,853 --> 00:31:59,028
television series. And I think Benson and Moorhead
also deserve to be tapped for a full length

354
00:31:59,068 --> 00:32:03,411
feature film in the future, because if Moon
Knight and Loki are anything to go by, they

355
00:32:03,431 --> 00:32:08,975
would do fantastic. Yeah, I mean, Destin Daniel
Cretton is no longer going to direct Avengers

356
00:32:09,015 --> 00:32:15,419
the Kang Dynasty. So why not tap these guys
for that film? I would love that, honestly.

357
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:20,703
I would love that. Especially since it's just
continuing Kang's story. Right, exactly. And

358
00:32:20,723 --> 00:32:25,026
they did a great job with Victor Timely in this
season. I could totally see that. With how

359
00:32:25,066 --> 00:32:30,649
great everything looks and feels with this show,
I just wish Marvel would take a more artistic

360
00:32:30,669 --> 00:32:35,212
approach like this to their other projects.
And if Vincent and Moorhead were tapped for

361
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:39,735
the King dynasty, I think they might bring that
more artistic approach to the film. The story

362
00:32:39,775 --> 00:32:45,459
of the Loki series is such that I'm not really
surprised wherever it goes because the nature

363
00:32:45,699 --> 00:32:50,182
of the TVA is that you can kind of take the
story to any time or place imaginable. But

364
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:55,184
in the first season, you know, we went to first
century Pompeii, alien planets like Lomantis

365
00:32:55,344 --> 00:33:00,886
1. We went to the void at the end of time. Whereas
in season two, we went to such exciting places

366
00:33:00,906 --> 00:33:07,329
like Oklahoma in the 80s, London in the 70s,
and 19th century Chicago. Although I'll admit

367
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:12,751
that Chicago was an impressive period setting.
But the story really scales back from all the

368
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:18,113
time hopping to focus more on the TVA and the
ramifications that a multiverse has on that

369
00:33:18,173 --> 00:33:23,012
organization. It was kind of a bit more of a
smaller scale story in that regard, but with

370
00:33:23,072 --> 00:33:27,574
more focus on this primary group of characters.
And I actually really enjoyed the time that

371
00:33:27,594 --> 00:33:31,857
we got to spend at the TVA with Ouroboros and
the gang as they tried to solve the problem

372
00:33:31,897 --> 00:33:36,540
of the temporal loom. Yeah, I didn't mind the
scaled back nature of the series. I thought

373
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:42,623
six episodes was perfect. I thought they did
enough interesting things with the story that

374
00:33:42,843 --> 00:33:46,245
it didn't really matter that it didn't have
much action or set pieces or something like

375
00:33:46,265 --> 00:33:50,149
that. I just enjoyed where the story took me.
You mentioned that the show doesn't really

376
00:33:50,309 --> 00:33:55,694
surprise you. I was surprised so many times
during this season, and I think that's one

377
00:33:55,714 --> 00:34:00,598
of the reasons I really enjoyed it. Yeah, there
were several cliffhangers at the end of the

378
00:34:00,658 --> 00:34:05,903
episodes that just left me with my jaw open,
you know, like really ready to just binge the

379
00:34:05,923 --> 00:34:10,087
next episode and see what the heck is going
on. Did you binge the series or did you watch

380
00:34:10,107 --> 00:34:15,703
it week to week? I watched the first two episodes.
as they came out and then I watched the last

381
00:34:15,783 --> 00:34:20,227
four episodes. I binged them before I wrote
the review. Okay, yeah, see this series, if

382
00:34:20,327 --> 00:34:24,070
I was watching it week to week, I feel like
I would have just hated that. Cause I would

383
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:28,814
have just been thinking like the whole week,
like what the hell is happening? For sure,

384
00:34:28,974 --> 00:34:33,939
yeah, it could be infuriating, but also infuriating
is, you know, getting spoiled ahead of time

385
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:37,462
on what's gonna happen on the show. So I was
at least glad that even though I waited to

386
00:34:37,542 --> 00:34:41,945
binge the series, I wasn't really spoiled on
anything major that happens at the end. Well,

387
00:34:42,566 --> 00:34:48,130
I was spoiled on a few things but I had no context
for them, so it ended up not being too much

388
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:52,975
of a spoiler. Yeah, I will say that watching
the first two episodes as they came out, my

389
00:34:52,995 --> 00:34:57,458
impression of the show was that it was fine,
you know? I didn't think we really were getting

390
00:34:57,519 --> 00:35:02,663
into the meat of the story until I binged the
last four and those last four episodes starting

391
00:35:02,723 --> 00:35:07,450
with Chicago and Victor Timely leading up into
the- final two episodes, which I thought were

392
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:12,131
absolutely fantastic in movie quality, there
was like a vast difference in the quality of

393
00:35:12,171 --> 00:35:18,013
the show, where the first two episodes weren't
bad, but the last two episodes were just sublime.

394
00:35:18,153 --> 00:35:22,594
Oh man, yeah, the last two episodes took the
show to a whole other level. I would agree

395
00:35:22,694 --> 00:35:27,215
that the first couple of episodes, I thought
they were okay, I agree with you, but the last

396
00:35:27,235 --> 00:35:32,157
two episodes does things that I never thought
Marvel Studios would ever do in terms of like

397
00:35:32,617 --> 00:35:37,506
artistic quality for a series based on a comic
book. Yeah, or what Marvel Studios would do

398
00:35:37,646 --> 00:35:43,868
for the character of Loki. You know, where he
goes in this story is such fascinating character

399
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:49,090
growth based on where he came from. Oh, yeah.
And honestly, like, I still don't even fully

400
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:54,791
understand what happened. All I know is that
it was beautiful. Well, we'll dive into it

401
00:35:54,951 --> 00:36:00,433
in our character breakdown, starting with Loki
played by Tom Hiddleston. Now, Tom Hiddleston's

402
00:36:00,573 --> 00:36:06,240
portrayal of Loki. by this time has transcended
his peers and become something more than a

403
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,642
simple supervillain role, something that feels
significant and mythic in a way that no singular

404
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:16,365
Marvel role has before, something that only
Hiddleston himself could inhabit as one of

405
00:36:16,405 --> 00:36:20,887
the very best actors of his generation. I think
he outdid himself here, and while I can only

406
00:36:20,947 --> 00:36:25,029
hope we see this character again, the ending
of this season would be one hell of a send

407
00:36:25,089 --> 00:36:30,479
off for Loki. Oh yeah, I definitely agree. What
they're doing with this character is so much

408
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,321
better than what they're doing with his brother
Thor in movies like Love and Thunder. It's

409
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:41,164
like no comparison. Yeah, Thor should be ashamed.
Like I hope Chris Hemsworth watches Loki season

410
00:36:41,184 --> 00:36:45,585
two and goes to Marvel Studios and says, I want
to do something like that. I'm sick of the

411
00:36:45,625 --> 00:36:50,187
dick and fart jokes and fucking bow the God
of Dumplings. Let's do something real with

412
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:55,629
the character of Thor and give him his proper
send off if Chris Hemsworth returns to the

413
00:36:55,669 --> 00:37:00,880
role. which you probably will. Loki's arc this
season had less to do with Sylvie, which I

414
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:07,165
was happy with. Here, it was more about stopping
He Who Remains, then about saving the TVA,

415
00:37:07,305 --> 00:37:13,088
and then saving time itself. All because, after
being humbled by the TVA in season 1, he made

416
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:18,472
friends who he felt were worth saving. You know,
he transformed over the course of all his on-screen

417
00:37:18,492 --> 00:37:23,784
appearances from the most selfish being ever.
with simple aspirations of a throne to actually

418
00:37:23,944 --> 00:37:29,249
achieving a throne through the most selfless
act of eternal sacrifice. It's a beautiful

419
00:37:29,309 --> 00:37:35,495
story. Oh man, yeah. To go from the first Avengers
movie where he's saying that he's Loki and

420
00:37:35,535 --> 00:37:41,961
he's burdened with glorious purpose to learn
in this show that purpose is more burden than

421
00:37:42,001 --> 00:37:48,926
glory, the arc from one to the other is incredibly
profound. Yeah, especially since he's doing

422
00:37:48,966 --> 00:37:54,248
it for his friends, you know, and his role is
so lonely now perched atop that throne all

423
00:37:54,288 --> 00:37:58,450
by himself outside of time. But, you know, it's
something he's willing to do to ensure the

424
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:02,952
survival of those he loves, which is not something
that you ever could have conceived of the character

425
00:38:03,312 --> 00:38:08,694
based on his actions in the first Avengers film.
I liken his arc, particularly in this season,

426
00:38:09,174 --> 00:38:15,317
to Bill Murray's arc in Groundhog Day. You know,
they're very similar. He sort of attains enlightenment

427
00:38:15,477 --> 00:38:22,581
over the course of. living many lives as it
were and again profound it's very interesting

428
00:38:22,621 --> 00:38:28,163
to see a character who was a villain become
so unbelievably selfless yeah to see real change

429
00:38:28,424 --> 00:38:34,767
believable change is always thought-provoking
it's cathartic yeah let's move on to mobius

430
00:38:34,827 --> 00:38:39,809
who's played by owen wilson i gotta say owen
wilson is the most likable actor on the planet

431
00:38:40,278 --> 00:38:44,739
Like, I love seeing him in this role. He's fantastic
as Mobius, especially later on in the season

432
00:38:44,759 --> 00:38:49,421
when you got to see the TVA agents in their
lives on the Timeline branches. And we got

433
00:38:49,441 --> 00:38:55,464
to see that Mobius was a jet ski dealer named
Don, which kind of went full circle with Mobius's

434
00:38:55,484 --> 00:39:01,207
fascination with jet skis in the TVA. Yeah,
I think his story really sold the notion of

435
00:39:01,247 --> 00:39:06,869
how tragic it was that these characters in the
TVA lost lives that they could have lived on

436
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:11,439
Timeline branches. Yeah, what did you think
of him retiring from the TVA at the end of

437
00:39:11,459 --> 00:39:15,202
the show? I mean, I'm really happy for him.
I don't know quite how that's going to work

438
00:39:15,242 --> 00:39:19,064
out with a Deadpool movie because he's supposed
to make a cameo in that or something like that.

439
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:24,647
But I was happy to see the character kind of
get what he always wanted. Yeah, it was kind

440
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:30,691
of bittersweet watching him watch his variant
take care of his kids. You know, we know that

441
00:39:30,791 --> 00:39:36,234
he can actually resume his life since that other
Don already exists. But I like to think that

442
00:39:36,294 --> 00:39:40,916
Mobius kind of spends his days out on the water
on his jet ski or something. It was quite a

443
00:39:40,956 --> 00:39:45,798
touching moment though at the very end there.
Yeah, absolutely. Let's move on to Ouroboros

444
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:51,620
who is played by Keihei Kuan. I hope I'm pronouncing
that right. But he was such a fantastic addition

445
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:57,283
to the Loki cast. He fits so perfectly in with
the show's atmosphere and sensibilities. It's

446
00:39:57,323 --> 00:40:01,184
almost like he was always a part of the show
from the beginning. You know, it was just incredible

447
00:40:01,204 --> 00:40:06,218
casting. And I hope that the actor blows up
Hollywood. and shows up in everything because

448
00:40:06,238 --> 00:40:10,761
he's just so enjoyable to watch that it's impossible
for him to be overexposed in my opinion. Haha,

449
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:15,703
I would agree. I mean, this is the first we're
seeing Kim after his Oscar win, I believe.

450
00:40:15,723 --> 00:40:19,725
I don't know, I haven't seen the new Indiana
Jones movie. I think he's actually in that.

451
00:40:20,205 --> 00:40:23,847
But it was great to see him again after, you
know, watching everything everywhere all at

452
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:28,849
once. And you're right, he fit in perfectly
into this world, which itself is fairly quirky.

453
00:40:29,426 --> 00:40:35,030
Yeah, he could get a very quirky yet endearing
type vibe as the technician behind the TVA,

454
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:38,813
but I also thought it was kind of funny when
he turned out to be this physics teacher and

455
00:40:38,933 --> 00:40:44,257
failed science fiction writer. Yeah, that was
a great choice. Much like Owen Wilson as Mobius,

456
00:40:44,558 --> 00:40:50,342
I think the casting director should be commended
for getting actors that are just very enjoyable

457
00:40:50,362 --> 00:40:55,182
to watch, very endearing, and inhabit the roles
and the world of Loki so well. Let's move on

458
00:40:55,222 --> 00:41:00,085
to Sylvie, who's played by Sofia DiMartino,
reprising her role from season one. She did

459
00:41:00,105 --> 00:41:04,328
have a smaller role here, a more supporting
character to Loki's main narrative, which I

460
00:41:04,348 --> 00:41:09,451
thought was nice. She did have a worse haircut.
I hated her haircut in this season. Like, I

461
00:41:09,491 --> 00:41:13,694
don't usually comment on characters' hair, but
the fact that it was like a mullet just kind

462
00:41:13,754 --> 00:41:19,502
of threw me. I liked her hair last season, but
no, I agree. It was a choice. wrong one. I

463
00:41:19,542 --> 00:41:24,867
like that the show completely ditched the whole
awkward romantic subplot between the two Loki's

464
00:41:25,267 --> 00:41:30,051
because I think a lot of critics rightfully
so felt that it was just kind of like incestuous

465
00:41:30,091 --> 00:41:36,076
and creepy. Here Sylvie was mainly just someone
who wanted everyone to have free will and the

466
00:41:36,136 --> 00:41:40,239
right to existence. So she's kind of like a
freedom fighter in that regard. Less extreme

467
00:41:40,279 --> 00:41:44,563
than she was in season one but more likeable.
I did find it interesting that like immediately

468
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:50,838
after killing He Who Remains she decided to
go live her life working at McDonald's. There

469
00:41:50,858 --> 00:41:55,340
was like a huge product placement for McDonald's.
I was like, what the heck? Absolutely, I don't

470
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,621
know how I feel about that. But like you think
about like one of the most mundane scenarios

471
00:41:59,661 --> 00:42:03,882
for her. I think that's what she wanted for
herself. You know, she had spent her entire

472
00:42:03,922 --> 00:42:09,184
life living in apocalypses and living on the
run that the ideal existence for her was the

473
00:42:09,224 --> 00:42:14,294
exact opposite. You know, routine, a lack of
excitement, things like that. It made sense

474
00:42:14,334 --> 00:42:18,755
for the character and despite the fact that,
you know, she killed He-He Remains and kind

475
00:42:18,815 --> 00:42:23,356
of caused this whole mess, you still felt for
her. True, yeah. And she ended up going right

476
00:42:23,396 --> 00:42:27,558
back to the very same spot at the end of the
show. Which I thought was great. You know,

477
00:42:27,658 --> 00:42:32,059
she had already found where she wanted to end
up. Her happy ending, as it were. Yeah, but

478
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:35,960
considering Asgardians live for about 10,000
years, I wonder how long that'll stick. Before

479
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:40,921
she's moving on beyond McDonald's and getting
back into the action, as it were. Who knows?

480
00:42:41,446 --> 00:42:45,467
But if this is the last we ever see of Sylvie,
I thought it was fantastic. I think her whole

481
00:42:45,487 --> 00:42:50,388
character arc was quite brilliant as well. Honestly,
I hope it's not the last we see of Sylvie.

482
00:42:50,728 --> 00:42:55,990
I definitely think there is potential for her
to go on to become a mainstay in the MCU, whether

483
00:42:56,050 --> 00:43:01,111
it's as a hero or a villain. How would you feel
about that? Well, I mean, honestly, I hope

484
00:43:01,131 --> 00:43:04,532
this isn't the last we see of any of the characters.
I hope we get a Loki season three, you know,

485
00:43:04,632 --> 00:43:09,353
so. Well, the showrunner said that that's not
going to happen, I believe. Yeah, I heard that

486
00:43:09,393 --> 00:43:14,244
too, which is a shame. But I also heard rumors
that Loki will appear in Secret Wars, but you

487
00:43:14,264 --> 00:43:17,507
know, rumors say that everybody's going to appear
in Secret Wars, so who knows? Who the hell

488
00:43:17,567 --> 00:43:23,592
is it? I'm going to be in Secret Wars. Let's
go ahead and move on to Victor Timely, played

489
00:43:23,632 --> 00:43:29,017
by Jonathan Majors. God, I hope Jonathan Majors
didn't do that shit that they said he did to

490
00:43:29,037 --> 00:43:33,180
his girlfriend. I hope he doesn't get convicted
with criminal charges. And I hope Marvel Studios

491
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:37,323
sticks with him, because if this season showed
anything, it shows that he's a really talented

492
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:41,719
guy, you know, is meek and stuttering Victor
Timely. is so different from his cocky and

493
00:43:41,759 --> 00:43:46,565
eccentric he-who-remains, who is also so different
from his angry and menacing king of the conqueror

494
00:43:46,585 --> 00:43:52,831
from quantumania. I was impressed with his performance
here, especially at his ability to elicit sympathy

495
00:43:52,992 --> 00:43:58,558
in the scene where Sylvie was gonna kill him.
Oh yeah, totally. I mean, for an actor that

496
00:43:58,618 --> 00:44:03,819
people know is probably not so sympathetic in
real life, to elicit sympathy on screen and

497
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:09,924
still have the viewer experience that emotion
is evidence that he's a fantastic actor. I

498
00:44:09,964 --> 00:44:14,549
agree with you, I hope we get to see more of
him. I know a lot of people are angry with

499
00:44:14,609 --> 00:44:21,695
him and want to cancel him, and maybe rightfully
so, but people make mistakes and I think, you

500
00:44:21,715 --> 00:44:27,100
know, as long as you leave room for redemption,
hopefully he takes that opportunity and maybe

501
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:31,804
hopefully is able to come back. There were other
major characters in the series including Hunter

502
00:44:31,824 --> 00:44:36,869
B-15, Casey, Ravonna Renslayer, and Miss Minutes,
but there wasn't too much going on arc wise

503
00:44:36,889 --> 00:44:41,413
with them that I think merits discussion. So
let's go ahead and move on to the story highlights.

504
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:51,053
Hey guys, Marvelous Joe here to tell all of

516
00:45:52,576 --> 00:45:59,918
Thanks guys! Alright, episode 1 was titled Ouroboros.
After Loki gets sent to the Time Variance Authority

517
00:45:59,938 --> 00:46:05,299
by Sylvie at the Citadel at the end of time,
he begins slipping between the past and present.

518
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:13,006
While trying to warn the TVA of the threat of
he who remains and his variance, Loki and with

519
00:46:13,046 --> 00:46:18,048
help from the technician named Ouroboros, who
deduces that the issue is the result of an

520
00:46:18,168 --> 00:46:24,890
overloaded temporal loom, a device that refines
raw time into physical timelines. Ouroboros

521
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:30,032
constructs a temporal aura extractor device
that pulls Loki from the time stream into the

522
00:46:30,072 --> 00:46:35,715
present TVA. General Dox, after receiving orders
not to prune the new timelines from Judge Gamble,

523
00:46:35,935 --> 00:46:40,737
rallies a group of hunters to allegedly find
Sylvie, who is in hiding at a McDonald's in

524
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:47,288
1982 Oklahoma. There was some good setup here
that got pay off in later episodes such as

525
00:46:47,348 --> 00:46:51,630
Loki pruning himself from the future into the
past. I thought it was clever when they paid

526
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:55,852
that off later in the season. Yeah, that was
sort of a mystery that was running for a while.

527
00:46:56,072 --> 00:47:00,574
Like, who pruned him at that moment? Yeah, and
why was Sylvie there and all that stuff? It

528
00:47:00,614 --> 00:47:06,017
was a good mystery. What was really interesting
was the answer that we had at the end of Loki

529
00:47:06,037 --> 00:47:11,913
season one, which was... Where is Loki or when
is Loki when he's talking to Mobius and Mobius

530
00:47:11,933 --> 00:47:16,698
has no idea who he is and we see the statue
of Kink. We theorized that maybe Loki was sent

531
00:47:16,738 --> 00:47:22,043
to an alternate version of the TVA, but as we
learned here, there's only one version of the

532
00:47:22,083 --> 00:47:27,367
TVA no matter how many branching timelines there
are, and Loki was merely sent into the distant

533
00:47:27,447 --> 00:47:33,953
past of the TVA. Which is actually pretty trippy
knowing that time runs differently at the TVA.

534
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:38,893
Right, there's a past, present, future, even
though it technically exists outside of the

535
00:47:38,933 --> 00:47:42,896
timelines, right? That's pretty interesting.
But we saw him go back and forth in time at

536
00:47:42,936 --> 00:47:48,221
the TVA, from a point to where he remains was
in charge of the organization, to later on

537
00:47:48,261 --> 00:47:53,085
where he kind of removed himself and put in
those figureheads, as it were. The timekeepers.

538
00:47:53,445 --> 00:47:58,649
Exactly. Let's go to move on to episode two,
which was called Breaking Brad. Trying to find

539
00:47:58,729 --> 00:48:05,582
Sylvie, Loki and Mobius track down X-5 in 1977
London. believing that this TVA hunter found

540
00:48:05,622 --> 00:48:11,765
her due to his Tempad going dark. They discover
that X-Five is hiding and living on the sacred

541
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:17,047
timeline as a famous actor named Brad Wolf.
They apprehend him and bring him back to the

542
00:48:17,087 --> 00:48:21,829
TVA where they learn through interrogation that
X-Five learned of Sylvie's whereabouts before

543
00:48:21,869 --> 00:48:28,032
abandoning his mission. TVA clerk Casey deduces
that former head judge Ravonna Renslayer received

544
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:33,026
a message from the artificial intelligence Miss
Minutes before both disappeared. and Ouroboros

545
00:48:33,046 --> 00:48:38,170
warns that he cannot fix the temporal loom from
meltdown without the temporal aura of He Who

546
00:48:38,210 --> 00:48:44,594
Remains to open the containment doors. Loki,
Mobius, and X-Five travel to 1982 to meet with

547
00:48:44,634 --> 00:48:49,598
Sylvie, where X-Five reveals that General Dox
and her group are secretly pruning the new

548
00:48:49,638 --> 00:48:55,081
timelines. They fight and capture her to prevent
any further pruning. This was I think maybe

549
00:48:55,121 --> 00:48:59,184
the most inconsequential episode of the season.
I just wasn't really interested in the character

550
00:48:59,264 --> 00:49:04,787
of Brad Wolf or X-Five. that he was kind of
an unnecessary addition to the cast of characters.

551
00:49:05,327 --> 00:49:10,209
Yeah, no, I agree. It took me a while to realize
that Brad and X5 were the same person, even

552
00:49:10,269 --> 00:49:15,652
though they were saying that they were looking
for X5. Like, I didn't I didn't quite catch

553
00:49:15,792 --> 00:49:22,094
who X5 even was until later on, considering
the fact that Brad and X5 looked fairly different.

554
00:49:22,134 --> 00:49:28,597
Like X5 had a beard. Brad didn't. It was confusing
for a while. Yeah, the hair thing kind of threw

555
00:49:28,617 --> 00:49:33,348
me right. If this season had any missteps, I
think the biggest one was probably around the

556
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:39,413
character of Brad. Let's go ahead and move on
to episode 3, which was called 1893. In 1868

557
00:49:40,133 --> 00:49:44,737
Chicago, Miss Minutes has Ravonna Renslayer
leave a copy of the TVA guidebook for young

558
00:49:44,817 --> 00:49:50,421
Victor Timely, a variant of He Who Remains,
to find. In the present, Ouroboros deduces

559
00:49:50,461 --> 00:49:54,644
that without He Who Remains temporal aura to
open the blast doors, they could still use

560
00:49:54,704 --> 00:50:00,247
Miss Minutes to override the controls. Locine
Mobius track her to 1893 Chicago where they

561
00:50:00,287 --> 00:50:05,529
find her and Renslayer observing Victor Timely
who has built TVA prototypes as well as fake

562
00:50:05,569 --> 00:50:11,372
inventions as scams for money. Sylvie interrupts
in an attempt to kill Timely but he escapes

563
00:50:11,392 --> 00:50:16,534
with Renslayer and Miss Minnitz who want him
to take He Who Remains Place running the TVA

564
00:50:16,694 --> 00:50:21,496
at the Citadel at the end of time alongside
them. Miss Minnitz gets shut off after coming

565
00:50:21,736 --> 00:50:27,139
onto Timely and Sylvie appears. only to spare
Victor and have Loki and Mobius take him to

566
00:50:27,159 --> 00:50:32,723
the TVA. She sends Renslayer to the Citadel
at the end of time with Miss Minutes. I didn't

567
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:36,926
love what they did with Miss Minutes here. I
thought it was really weird that she was in

568
00:50:37,006 --> 00:50:42,450
love with Victor Timely. Yeah, it kinda seemed
unnecessary to me as well, especially considering

569
00:50:42,610 --> 00:50:46,573
that it didn't really go anywhere. But Miss
Minutes was incredibly uncomfortable during

570
00:50:46,613 --> 00:50:50,155
this whole season, I thought. Like, especially
in the later episode when they're killing all

571
00:50:50,175 --> 00:50:55,883
those TVA hunters and she's like smiling that
creepy cartoon smile as they're all being crushed

572
00:50:55,903 --> 00:51:02,148
to death. It was effectively creepy, but was
it a necessary creep factor? I almost wish

573
00:51:02,168 --> 00:51:07,511
that they used Miss Minutes more perhaps as
the main villain at the end. With how creepy

574
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:12,695
she was, I think she deserved a better send-off
than merely just being shut off by Ouroboros.

575
00:51:13,276 --> 00:51:18,600
I agree, I didn't love how Miss Minutes and
Rentslayer's arcs were just kind of dropped

576
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:22,975
at the very end. There were a few things that
kind of just became irrelevant as the show

577
00:51:22,995 --> 00:51:27,558
decided to kind of explore a little bit more
of like Loki's psyche and what he's going through

578
00:51:27,618 --> 00:51:32,662
personally. Yeah, Ramona Renslayer was merely
pruned and sent to the void at the end of time

579
00:51:32,682 --> 00:51:37,265
where she was I think devoured by Eliath. Although
that being said, you know, Miss Minence and

580
00:51:37,325 --> 00:51:42,309
Renslayer weren't really in the season until
this episode, so they were really merely side

581
00:51:42,329 --> 00:51:48,033
plots. Yeah, absolutely. I really liked the
setting of late 19th century Chicago. I thought

582
00:51:48,053 --> 00:51:52,795
they did really well. with the cinematography,
with the costuming, with the set design. Yeah,

583
00:51:52,815 --> 00:51:56,777
that carnival seemed pretty interesting. What
did you think of the idea of Victor Timely

584
00:51:56,817 --> 00:52:01,419
as a scam artist? That threw me. I didn't see
that coming. That was a surprise. I thought

585
00:52:01,459 --> 00:52:07,221
he was a legit scientific inventor. And I didn't
know if it was just because he was a variant

586
00:52:07,321 --> 00:52:12,403
in this universe that he wasn't like the scientific
genius or whatever. I guess he still was. He

587
00:52:12,444 --> 00:52:17,954
just didn't have the technology to create what
he really wanted to. Exactly. Yeah, he was

588
00:52:17,994 --> 00:52:23,278
limited by the technology of his time. He was
a genius, he was also running scams, so it

589
00:52:23,298 --> 00:52:27,522
was a little bit vague for a minute there as
to whether or not he was just a loony variant

590
00:52:27,682 --> 00:52:31,225
or if he actually was smart. I'm glad it was
the latter. Let's go ahead and move on to episode

591
00:52:31,265 --> 00:52:36,969
4 which is called Heart of the TVA. Miss Minutes
reveals to Renslayer that she was once a commander

592
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:42,674
of He Who Remains Army and co-leader at the
end of time before he had her memories erased.

593
00:52:47,062 --> 00:52:51,925
that will prevent the Temporal Loom from melting
down and allow it to accommodate more timelines.

594
00:52:52,465 --> 00:52:57,229
Meanwhile, Renslayer and Miss Minutes attempt
to overtake the TVA by recruiting General Docs

595
00:52:57,289 --> 00:53:02,732
and her group of hunters in custody. All but
X5 reject Renslayer's offer and are killed.

596
00:53:03,353 --> 00:53:10,097
X5 kidnaps Timely, forcing Goroboros to shut
off Miss Minutes. Sylvie enchants X5, forcing

597
00:53:10,137 --> 00:53:15,841
him to prune Ribona. With Timely saved, he opens
the containment doors with his Temporal Aura.

598
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:21,398
and volunteers to activate the throughput multiplier.
However, they're too late and the temporal

599
00:53:21,418 --> 00:53:26,402
radiation turns him into spaghetti as he approaches
the temporal loom. I liked this episode. I

600
00:53:26,442 --> 00:53:31,286
thought there was like a lot of tension, you
know, back and forth where you are riddled

601
00:53:31,306 --> 00:53:36,330
with anxiety as the clock is ticking and Victor
Timely is kidnapped. And then you're relieved

602
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:41,575
when he's rescued. And then you're shocked when
he is spaghettified in the temporal radiation.

603
00:53:41,595 --> 00:53:46,158
I thought there was a lot of great like emotion
pulling in this episode. Yeah, that was pretty

604
00:53:46,198 --> 00:53:51,241
wild when he just straight up was like disintegrated
like that, like spaghetti. Did not see that

605
00:53:51,301 --> 00:53:57,864
coming. But also I kind of felt overall with
this main conflict of the whole temporal loom

606
00:53:58,064 --> 00:54:04,208
overloading, it was a little vague as to what
exactly the consequences were going to be until

607
00:54:04,368 --> 00:54:08,990
you saw Victor Tynely spaghettified. Yeah, and
then as you saw the temporal loom explode and

608
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:14,373
everybody's just standing there like, what the
fuck do we do? That was the season's best cliffhanger,

609
00:54:14,573 --> 00:54:20,088
I think. Absolutely. Where you just saw Loki's
face and then end credits. I'm like what the

610
00:54:20,248 --> 00:54:24,551
heck is gonna happen now? Exactly. I was like
is this the season finale? What's going on?

611
00:54:25,811 --> 00:54:30,594
Let's go to move on to episode 5 which is called
science fiction Loki escapes the meltdown by

612
00:54:30,674 --> 00:54:35,737
time-slipping to the branch timelines where
his friends from the TVA are from Discovering

613
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:42,360
that they were reset to their original lives
He finds Ouroboros aka Doug who is a theoretical

614
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:48,135
physics teacher and failed science fiction writer
and enlists his help in building a Tempad to

615
00:54:48,315 --> 00:54:53,297
use to recruit the others to go back in time
to the TVA and succeed where they had previously

616
00:54:53,357 --> 00:54:58,899
failed. Loki convinces everyone but Sylvie,
who gets him to admit that his true motivation

617
00:54:59,039 --> 00:55:04,762
is to keep from losing his friends, and concedes
that their lives outside the TVA may be better

618
00:55:04,782 --> 00:55:10,544
for them. Nonetheless, as the Temporal Loom
can't sustain the branches, everything spaghettifies

619
00:55:10,644 --> 00:55:15,722
anyway, forcing Loki to gain control of his
time slipping. and allowing him to travel to

620
00:55:15,782 --> 00:55:22,865
any point in time and space. The scene where
Loki apparently abandons the mission for the

621
00:55:22,905 --> 00:55:27,707
betterment of his friends, and we see Sylvie
visiting that record store and just listen

622
00:55:27,727 --> 00:55:33,990
to an album as everything starts going to shit
was nightmare fuel. It was so surreal. Oh,

623
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:38,532
absolutely. Yeah, it's terrifying. After seeing
what happened to Victor Timely in the previous

624
00:55:38,592 --> 00:55:43,815
episode, and then seeing everything spaghettify,
It turned out to be quite the horrifying effect.

625
00:55:43,915 --> 00:55:48,397
Like every time it would happen, I actually
felt this sense of dread. Especially as they're

626
00:55:48,417 --> 00:55:52,880
like running from it in slow motion and you
know there's just like no escape. You just

627
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:57,583
wait for it to hit you. Yeah, exactly, nightmare
fuel. The effect itself kind of reminded me

628
00:55:57,663 --> 00:56:02,706
of string theory, which essentially states that
particles are strings that move through time

629
00:56:02,746 --> 00:56:07,508
and space, and those were all just kind of like
disappearing, those strings. Yeah, exactly.

630
00:56:07,949 --> 00:56:14,451
Moving on to the final episode. episode 6 called
Glorious Purpose. In it, Loki travels to before

631
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:19,672
the loom's meltdown and fails repeatedly to
get the throughput multiplier to work. After

632
00:56:19,712 --> 00:56:24,574
successfully activating it, he learns it's all
pointless as the loom will never be able to

633
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:30,175
accommodate infinitely growing branches. Loki
then has to travel back to before Sylvie killed

634
00:56:30,215 --> 00:56:35,397
He Who Remains where he learns that the loom
is a failsafe that will protect the sacred

635
00:56:35,437 --> 00:56:40,434
timeline by deleting all the branches along
with the TVA. and that destroying the loom

636
00:56:40,574 --> 00:56:45,775
would lead to infinite realities and the multiversal
war. He Who Remains states the only way to

637
00:56:45,816 --> 00:56:50,857
save the loom is to kill Sylvie, which Loki
rejects. Loki travels through time to confer

638
00:56:50,877 --> 00:56:56,239
with Mobius, who tells him that purpose is more
about burden than glory, but the hard thing

639
00:56:56,259 --> 00:57:02,060
to do is the thing that has to be done. He then
travels to visit Sylvie, who tells him, sometimes

640
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:07,022
it's okay to destroy something if there's hope
you can replace it with something better. With

641
00:57:07,042 --> 00:57:11,684
that in mind, Loki travels to the time of the
meltdown and destroys the loom, giving the

642
00:57:11,704 --> 00:57:16,606
multiverse a chance to exist by replacing the
device and overseeing the timelines from a

643
00:57:16,646 --> 00:57:22,708
throne at the center of the timelines that become
Yggdrasil, the world tree. Mobius retires from

644
00:57:22,728 --> 00:57:28,711
the TVA, who now tracks the variants of he who
remains. Uh, brilliant episode, brilliant episode,

645
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:34,753
incredible. Wait, so Loki doesn't become a new
loom, transferring chaotic time into solidified

646
00:57:34,793 --> 00:57:39,484
time? Yeah, he essentially replaces the loom.
He becomes his own loom, preventing the multiversal

647
00:57:39,504 --> 00:57:43,327
war. Okay, that's what I thought. You know,
the start of the episode is really about him

648
00:57:43,367 --> 00:57:49,731
trying to get the throughput multiplier to work.
And it's so tragic that he had to spend centuries

649
00:57:49,872 --> 00:57:54,315
learning everything he could from Ouroboros
about theoretical physics, only for it to all

650
00:57:54,335 --> 00:57:59,378
be moot because the loom could never be upgraded
enough to accommodate infinite branches, you

651
00:57:59,398 --> 00:58:04,622
know? That was tragic. And then the big reveal
from He Who Remains stating that The loom is

652
00:58:04,662 --> 00:58:09,586
just a fail safe to protect the sacred timeline.
That was a big jaw drop moment. Just so many

653
00:58:09,606 --> 00:58:16,171
good scenes all leading up into the end, which
felt so poignant. The final shot of Loki sitting

654
00:58:16,231 --> 00:58:21,856
on his throne, accepting his role was a brilliant
bit of acting from Tom Hiddleston for one,

655
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:26,460
but such a fascinating way to end the series.
It was a fantastic ending, such a good ending.

656
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:31,784
I'm kind of glad there wasn't any kind of after
credit scenes because it didn't need it. Like

657
00:58:31,824 --> 00:58:37,104
just end with that mic drop. Boom, there you
go. Yeah, you know, I definitely, of course,

658
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:43,168
poured over the end credits looking for a scene,
but when that ended up being it, you settle

659
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:48,151
in with the closure of what you just saw. And
on my part, I felt really pleased with the

660
00:58:48,171 --> 00:58:53,735
way the season had gone. Really pleased, but
also really sad. It's a great mixture of emotions

661
00:58:53,755 --> 00:58:58,319
that I think just are a testament to how good
this season was. For sure, yeah. Every time

662
00:58:58,339 --> 00:59:02,121
you watch a good show that ends, doesn't that
usually come with a bit of sadness? Because

663
00:59:02,161 --> 00:59:06,683
it's over? I mean, it depends on the show. Some
shows have terrible endings like Game of Thrones,

664
00:59:07,123 --> 00:59:11,965
and some like this have very great endings where
you're sad that you won't get to be with these

665
00:59:12,005 --> 00:59:16,647
characters again, but you're also happy with
their lives the way they turned out and you

666
00:59:16,667 --> 00:59:22,389
don't really want to see any of that unravel.
Yeah. But that does a further review for Loki

667
00:59:22,409 --> 00:59:28,224
Season 2. God, it is a shame that it is over.
And I feel like we'll have similar sentiments

668
00:59:28,344 --> 00:59:33,768
about Doom Patrol season four in our next episode
when we review that. Just a great bit of long

669
00:59:33,788 --> 00:59:38,371
form television storytelling from Marvel and
DC. That'll be bittersweet saying goodbye to

670
00:59:38,391 --> 00:59:43,695
this year. Yeah, with MCU, you know, kind of
sending off Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, this

671
00:59:43,775 --> 00:59:50,879
is another hit, I think to the fandom, but like
in the best way. So kudos to Marvel Studios

672
00:59:50,919 --> 00:59:56,003
for getting something right, which I feel like
they haven't done in a while, because I enjoyed

673
00:59:56,043 --> 01:00:02,648
it a lot. Yeah, absolutely. With gorgeous cinematography,
extraordinary music score, and a matchless

674
01:00:02,688 --> 01:00:08,953
cast of characters, Loki season two to date
offers the best that Marvel Studios television

675
01:00:08,973 --> 01:00:14,437
has to offer. I'm giving this season four and
a half stars, a fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

676
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:20,668
And I think that makes sense, especially with
how profound the season was in particular.

677
01:00:20,988 --> 01:00:25,490
It was very different from what I thought it
was going to be. In a way, it defied my expectations

678
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:31,372
for the better, just in how many shocks and
surprises there ended up being, and how great

679
01:00:31,472 --> 01:00:38,515
the ending was. I agree. I actually also rated
season one 4.5 stars. You disagreed with me

680
01:00:38,795 --> 01:00:43,077
because you said that Loki was out of character,
but no, I've always been a fan of the show,

681
01:00:43,117 --> 01:00:48,685
and you're just a fake fan. Shut up. No, go
back and listen to our review of season one

682
01:00:48,705 --> 01:00:53,549
and I think you'll find that my gripes with
that season still hold up. But no, season two

683
01:00:53,569 --> 01:00:57,492
was fantastic. I liked it more than season one.
Four and a half stars. But that does it for

694
01:01:47,672 --> 01:01:53,153
Alfred Pennyworth vs Edwin Jarvis. As I mentioned
earlier, our next episode is going to be another

695
01:01:53,193 --> 01:01:59,615
review where we discuss season 4 of Doom Patrol.
Now this is a little bit late this episode.

696
01:01:59,715 --> 01:02:05,937
I think the series ended on November 9th I want
to say. Yes. But to save face, I blame Jonathan.

697
01:02:06,457 --> 01:02:13,390
I blame myself. I started a new job recently,
so it's been hard just, you know, not only

698
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:17,454
finishing the season, but reviewing it as well.
But yeah, we're going to talk all about the

699
01:02:17,474 --> 01:02:22,078
show next week. Doom Patrol is fantastic. I'm
expecting great things from it. But that does

700
01:02:22,098 --> 01:02:26,658
it for this episode. We want to give a big thanks
to our executive producers. Ken Johnson, John

701

Wagner, Levi Yeaton, Nick Ibbonto, Austin Wiselowski,
AJ Dunkerley, Scott Camacho, Adam Spies, and

703
01:02:37,807 --> 01:02:42,091
Andrew Schunk for helping make this podcast
possible. And we'll talk to you guys next week.

704
01:02:42,531 --> 01:02:47,996
Up up and away, true believers. Eat spaghetti
no regretty. Hello gamers, are you ready to

705
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:55,161
dive into a video game podcast unlike any other?
Then look no further. Welcome to Console Combat.

706
01:02:55,506 --> 01:03:00,549
I'm John. And I'm Dean. We're here to give you
the info on the latest releases, upcoming titles,

707
01:03:00,589 --> 01:03:04,531
and everything else that's making waves in the
gaming universe. That's right Dean, but that's

708
01:03:04,591 --> 01:03:09,574
not all we do here at Console Combat. Each week
we'll put two video game characters against

709
01:03:09,594 --> 01:03:15,418
each other in our epic battle simulator Cortex.
After a brief speculation, Cortex ultimately

710
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:21,221
determines who would emerge victorious by running
1,000 battles in its adopted Monte Carlo simulator.

711
01:03:21,858 --> 01:03:26,603
Who has the mightiest punch, the fastest speed,
or the most cunning strategy? On Console Combat,

712
01:03:26,763 --> 01:03:31,770
we'll put that to the test. Essentially, we're
a multiversal Super Smash Bros. style podcast.

713
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:36,575
So whether you're a casual player or a hardcore
gaming enthusiast, there's something for everyone

714
01:03:36,615 --> 01:03:41,822
here at Console Combat. So grab your controllers,
strap in, and let's get ready for some action.
