00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,957
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,202 --> 00:00:29,805
Hi, welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,845 --> 00:00:35,968
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:42,031
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous
Joe. And in this episode, we are reviewing

5
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:47,894
the latest DC animated film set in the Tomorrow
Verse Justice League, Crisis on Infinite Earths

6
00:00:47,974 --> 00:00:54,566
Part 1, the first part of a trilogy of films
that will end out this universe. Yeah, part

7
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:57,948
one came out about a week ago, the other two
parts are going to come out later this year.

8
00:00:58,448 --> 00:01:02,030
I was really surprised by this film. There's
a lot of films in the Tomorrowverse that I

9
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,794
haven't liked. It's been pretty much hit or
miss. But Crisis part one is really unique

10
00:01:08,254 --> 00:01:11,956
and I'm really looking forward to talking about
it. Before that, we're going to break down

11
00:01:11,996 --> 00:01:16,819
the comic movie news from the past week, of
which there was just one news item and that

12
00:01:16,839 --> 00:01:21,854
was the teaser trailer for Justice League Crisis
on Infinite Earths part- 2. So this is a full

13
00:01:21,954 --> 00:01:26,616
on Crisis on Infinite Earths episode, apparently.
As always, we list our segment times in our

31
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:01,462
from the 1989 Batman film and Captain America
from the 1990 Captain America film. This week,

32
00:03:01,803 --> 00:03:05,985
I believe hosts Ken and Scotty are going to
find out who would win between Steven Seagal's

33
00:03:06,045 --> 00:03:11,311
Casey Ryback from Under Siege. versus Chuck
Norris' major Scott McCoy from Delta Force.

39
00:03:38,054 --> 00:03:43,179
only between Tomb Raider's Lara Croft and Assassin's
Creed's Ezio Auditore, but also Super Mario

40
00:03:43,259 --> 00:03:49,866

in the Dynamike Podcast Network. But with that

42
00:03:54,371 --> 00:04:00,763
out of the way, quick to the no prize! A No
Prize is an award Marvel used to give out to

43
00:04:00,803 --> 00:04:05,826
fans. Our version, the Dynamic Dual No Prize,
is a digital award we post on Instagram and

44
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:10,329
in our email newsletter for the person that
we feel gave the best answer to our question

45
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:15,552
of the week. Last week, we asked, what other
character from the Daredevil Netflix series

46
00:04:15,572 --> 00:04:20,415
do you most hope returns for the Disney Plus
Daredevil born-again show and why? And this

47
00:04:20,455 --> 00:04:24,910
is coming off of the news that Deborah Anwalt
and Elden Henson will be... reprising their

48
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:30,212
roles as Karen Page and Foggy Nelson in the
Daredevil Born Again series. We got literally

49
00:04:30,252 --> 00:04:34,234
two answers for this question of the week, which
is not surprising because we only gave you

50
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:39,076
guys about two days to do it. So let's run down
our honorable mention as well as our no prize

51
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:45,158
winner. Our first honorable mention goes to
Lizzie Dyer Arnie, who said, Hey, it's Lizzie.

52
00:04:45,278 --> 00:04:49,860
So I really want to see Marcy Stahl return to
the new Daredevil series on Disney. If you

53
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,206
don't remember who she is, she's Foggy's on
again, off again girlfriend. who helped them

54
00:04:54,226 --> 00:04:59,208
take down Landman and Zack from the inside.
She provides much needed comic relief to the

55
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:05,631
show. And I think we are long overdue to see
Marcy and Foggy's wedding. Have a great day.

56
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:11,914
Now, I'm not going to lie. I barely remember
this character, but I do agree that Daredevil

57
00:05:12,014 --> 00:05:18,157
needed comic relief and she was great in the
role. Well, I thought Foggy himself provided

58
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:22,532
comic relief for the show. but it was nice that
they gave him a love interest because otherwise

59
00:05:22,612 --> 00:05:27,416
he was just kind of like the, you know, the
tag along sidekick character to Matt Murdock.

60
00:05:27,576 --> 00:05:31,940
I liked actress Amy Ruppberg in the role as
Marcy. I always thought she was like way too

61
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:37,284
hot for Foggy Nelson, but that was kind of like
the appeal of it, I think. It was nice to see

62
00:05:37,785 --> 00:05:41,728
this bumbling character get a girl who's way
out of his league. Yeah, that's true. Plus

63
00:05:41,788 --> 00:05:47,293
I also don't hate the idea that Lizzie gave
of Foggy finally getting married. Like the

64
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:51,138
guy deserves it. Yeah, it literally rains shit
on Foggy Nelson a lot, so it's nice to see

65
00:05:51,158 --> 00:05:55,600
that he has this one consistent good thing in
his life. Great answer Lizzy! But the winner

66
00:05:55,640 --> 00:06:01,621
of this week's No Prize is Judson Baddie. And
I hope I'm pronouncing that right. But he said,

67
00:06:02,242 --> 00:06:06,883
Hi guys, Judson Baddie here. Long time listener,
first time responder. I think the character

68
00:06:07,003 --> 00:06:11,764
and actor I'd like to see return for Dead Ever
Born again the most is Father Paul Langton

69
00:06:11,784 --> 00:06:17,491
played by Peter McRobbie. I feel like he had
some interesting dynamics. with Charlie Cox

70
00:06:17,551 --> 00:06:24,516
as Daredevil and provided and understated the
very important role in the spiritual side of

71
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:28,599
the Daredevil character and the show wouldn't
be the same without him. Well, you guys went

72
00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:33,342
with some pretty deep dives for your answers
for this question of the week. Father Lantern,

73
00:06:33,783 --> 00:06:39,387
played by Peter McRobbie on the Daredevil Netflix
show, was very much the soul of the show. He

74
00:06:39,427 --> 00:06:45,867
was essentially Matt Murdock's spiritual guide,
given that... Matt Murdock is a very religious

75
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:50,449
character in the comic books and in the show.
He's a devout Catholic. And I thought the actor

76
00:06:50,489 --> 00:06:56,512
Peter McRobbie did a great job and was an interesting
character in guiding Matt Murdock and discussing

77
00:06:56,552 --> 00:07:02,875
the ethics of his actions as both a Catholic
and a vigilante. Yeah, I'm not gonna lie. This

78
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:08,877
is another character I barely remember, but
I like this as the win for this week's question.

79
00:07:09,334 --> 00:07:15,039
because of how religious a character Daredevil
is. And it's pretty unique in comics that a

80
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:21,364
character is so heavily involved in his spirituality.
Yeah, I mean, it makes sense for a character

81
00:07:21,544 --> 00:07:26,249
named Daredevil, right? It kind of adds to the
intrigue given that, you know, he dresses up

82
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:31,313
like the devil and beats the shit out of people.
It's really interesting that dichotomy of Daredevil.

83
00:07:31,753 --> 00:07:36,938
Honestly, I thought we were going to get answers
like Electra and Bullseye. Right. Yeah. Bullseye

84
00:07:37,038 --> 00:07:42,842
was in fact the correct answer played by Wilson
Bethel. He was incredible in season three and

85
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:47,425
the dude needs to come back as Bullseye. He
was fantastic. Yeah, 100 percent. But great

86
00:07:47,465 --> 00:07:51,447
answer Jetson, you win this week's No Prize.
If you're the listener, want a shot at winning

87
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:56,631
your own No Prize, stay tuned to later on in
this episode when we'll be asking another question

88
00:07:56,671 --> 00:08:00,033
of the week. And now that that's done, on to
the news.

89
00:08:05,582 --> 00:08:11,123
Okay, so we recently got the official teaser
trailer for Justice League Crisis on Infinite

90
00:08:11,183 --> 00:08:17,125
Earths Part 2, the sequel to the film we're
about to review later in this episode, Crisis

91
00:08:17,165 --> 00:08:25,387
on Infinite Earths Part 1. Now, in Part 1, there's
quite a bit of time jumping, and it looks like

92
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:32,529
that may be the case for Part 2 as well. We
learned in Part 1 that Monitor's assistant

93
00:08:32,609 --> 00:08:39,197
of sorts, Harbinger, is actually Supergirl from
the Legion of Superheroes film, and it looks

94
00:08:39,217 --> 00:08:44,361
like in part two we're going to find out exactly
how she became Harbinger. It kind of looks

95
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:48,885
like she's going to be the main character of
part two, honestly, in the same way that Flash

96
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:54,409
was the main character of part one. Which is
not a big surprise of the two major sacrifices

97
00:08:54,429 --> 00:09:00,954
that happened in the comic book. Flash and Supergirl
were probably the most impactful. My guess

98
00:09:01,094 --> 00:09:05,996
is Supergirl does not make it to the end of
the film. That's just a guess. Sorry if that's

99
00:09:06,036 --> 00:09:10,478
a spoiler. Well, I mean, if you look at the
cover to the crisis on Infinite Earth's trade

100
00:09:10,518 --> 00:09:15,920
paperback, you'll see Superman holding a dead
Supergirl. So I don't know how much of a spoiler

101
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:19,841
that actually is. True. That's fair. Yeah. I
thought it was really cool to see the Bat family

102
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:25,984
at the beginning of this trailer, which seems
to include Batman Beyond and Batwing. Yeah,

103
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:30,238
honestly, that was pretty shocking seeing Batman
Beyond, who's from the future. considering

104
00:09:30,298 --> 00:09:35,762
the end of part one. Not gonna give away any
spoilers, but if you know, you know. It really

105
00:09:35,782 --> 00:09:41,186
looks like this film picks up right after the
events of part one, as we still see the frequency

106
00:09:41,286 --> 00:09:45,609
tuning fork tower in the background in the opening
shots. It looks like the main thread of this

107
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:50,152
movie though are these like shadow creatures.
Shadow demons, yes, they're from the comics.

108
00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:55,596
They're like the soldiers of the anti-monitor.
Interesting. We also get a shot of Psycho Pirate.

109
00:09:55,936 --> 00:09:59,830
It's not too clear what he's doing. but the
character is pretty interesting from the comics

110
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,811
so I'm looking forward to seeing what's going
on there. All in all there's really not too

111
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:08,012
much more to talk about. It's a really short
teaser, it's less than 45 seconds. I thought

112
00:10:08,032 --> 00:10:11,833
we were going to get a release date with it,
but at the very end it just says coming soon.

113
00:10:12,013 --> 00:10:16,715
So when we do get that release date, we'll make
sure to let you guys know. Because I'm looking

114
00:10:16,735 --> 00:10:21,996
forward to it for sure. Yeah, I think in total
this trilogy is going to be quite an epic series

115
00:10:22,016 --> 00:10:27,237
of films. But speaking of epic animated trilogies,
that brings us to our question of the week.

116
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:38,134

you want to see adapted as an animated film

121
00:10:55,506 --> 00:10:59,949
No Prize that we'll post to Instagram and our
email newsletter. Be sure to answer before

122
00:11:00,349 --> 00:11:01,309
January 27th.

123
00:11:08,718 --> 00:11:13,060
That does it for all the news for this episode,
now let's move on to the main event, where

124
00:11:13,141 --> 00:11:20,205
we review the latest DC animated film, Justice
League, Crisis on Infinite Earths, Part 1.

125
00:11:35,342 --> 00:11:41,625
Alright, Justice League Crisis on Infinite Earths
Part 1 is the latest in Warner Bros. Animation's

126
00:11:41,685 --> 00:11:49,470
Tomorrowverse world of direct-to-video DC animated
films, which is the follow-up universe to the

127
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:56,054
DC animated movie universe that ended with the
phenomenal film Justice League Dark Apocalypse

128
00:11:56,094 --> 00:12:02,890
War. Comparisons between the animated universes
have been inevitable. Most fans, I would say,

129
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:08,432
have been pining for a return to the DC AMU,
which had its critics, but has been widely

130
00:12:08,472 --> 00:12:15,574
accepted as being superior to the Tomorrowverse.
I personally have praised the Tomorrowverse's

131
00:12:15,614 --> 00:12:20,875
character designs and premises, but with the
exception of the two-part Batman the Long Halloween

132
00:12:20,895 --> 00:12:27,937
films, the overall execution of the Tomorrowverse
has ranged from fairly decent to borderline

133
00:12:28,077 --> 00:12:32,837
unwatchable. So how does Crisis on Infinite
Earths, the first part of a trilogy that's

134
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:38,643
being released throughout this year, compare
to the other Tomorrowverse films? I'm relieved

135
00:12:38,703 --> 00:12:43,868
to say it's one of the best. If you haven't
seen it yet, maybe because you've given up

136
00:12:43,928 --> 00:12:49,012
on the Tomorrowverse? I definitely recommend
watching it and it makes me want to recommend

137
00:12:49,052 --> 00:12:54,476
watching the entirety of the Tomorrowverse beforehand
because it really makes you appreciate little

138
00:12:54,516 --> 00:12:58,819
hints and Easter eggs they've sprinkled throughout
the other films to show that they've been building

139
00:12:58,939 --> 00:13:04,643
up to this concluding trilogy in order to successfully
capture the emotional impact that long time

140
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:10,186
DC fans had while first reading the Crisis on
Infinite Earths comic that this film is based

141
00:13:10,286 --> 00:13:16,647
on. I don't know that's a lot to ask audiences,
especially our listeners. Like putting them

142
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:21,992
through the likes of Justice Society World War
II or Legion of Superheroes or Justice League

143
00:13:22,032 --> 00:13:27,096
War World. Like, there's a lot of duds that
I just would not recommend watching just to

144
00:13:27,136 --> 00:13:32,361
better enjoy this film. It's surprising to me
that you said that Crisis on Infinite Earths

145
00:13:32,401 --> 00:13:39,007
Part 1 is one of the better entries in the tomorrowverse
because you're right. But also, this movie

146
00:13:39,047 --> 00:13:44,142
was mostly okay. So just... thinking that it
was actually still one of the best makes me

147
00:13:44,202 --> 00:13:49,524
kind of sad about the whole Tomorrowverse in
general. Well, I mean, the number one film

148
00:13:49,564 --> 00:13:54,946
in the Tomorrowverse was absolutely the two
part long Halloween, probably followed by Green

149
00:13:54,986 --> 00:14:00,067
Lantern Beware My Power. And I'm not sure if
I like this as much as Beware My Power. It

150
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:05,209
might be just underneath that, but I still liked
this film. Crisis on Infinite Earths is an

151
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:10,527
adaptation of the comic of the same name. Now
if you're not familiar with Crisis on Infinite

152
00:14:10,587 --> 00:14:16,791
Earths, it was the first major universe-spanning
blockbuster event in comics that drastically

153
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:23,575
changed DC's continuity and delivered explosive
stakes for long-time comic readers, going all

154
00:14:23,615 --> 00:14:29,338
the way back to 1956 when the introduction of
Barry Allen, the Flash, kicked off the Silver

155
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:35,902
Age of comics. The stories in the comics released
prior to that, during the Golden Age, were

156
00:14:35,942 --> 00:14:41,144
eventually revealed to have taken place in a
parallel universe that Barry Allen learned

157
00:14:41,164 --> 00:14:48,266
he could travel to. This set up the first-ever
multiverse, which became threatened in 1985

158
00:14:49,146 --> 00:14:55,629
by the Crisis on Infinite Earth storyline, where
we saw characters like Barry Allen die or sacrifice

159
00:14:55,649 --> 00:15:02,133
themselves during the event. Now to successfully
adapt a story like Crisis on Infinite Earths

160
00:15:02,274 --> 00:15:07,178
in animation, you have to try and match what
comic book writers had decades to accomplish,

161
00:15:07,298 --> 00:15:12,583
creating long-standing relationships between
fictional characters and invested audiences

162
00:15:12,683 --> 00:15:18,369
through serialized adventure stories. It's a
lot easier to create a comic book than it is

163
00:15:18,409 --> 00:15:24,270
to create an animated film though. Literally,
one or two guys can create a comic. compared

164
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:31,156
to sizable budgets and teams of animators needed
to create a future film. The Tomorrow vs Producers,

165
00:15:31,556 --> 00:15:36,841
Jim Krieg and Kimberly Moreau, who wanted to
do a Crisis on Infinite Earths adaptation,

166
00:15:37,001 --> 00:15:43,766
were allowed to create a 10-film universe, which
they used to lead up to this major trilogy

167
00:15:43,867 --> 00:15:49,970
event that begins with Crisis on Infinite Earths
Part 1. This was only recently revealed, but

168
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:55,332
going back to early films in the Tomorrowverse,
it's now apparent that not only have the filmmakers

169
00:15:55,372 --> 00:16:00,674
been planning their way to a crisis story, but
also that they've planned on involving prior

170
00:16:00,754 --> 00:16:08,616
animated universes such as the DC AMU and several
DC Showcase animated shorts, including Constantine,

171
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:15,735
House of Mystery, Adam Strange, and Commandie.
The connect- The connectivity blows my mind

172
00:16:15,815 --> 00:16:22,561
and makes me unbelievably excited for the releases
of part 2 and 3 later this year. Well, I remember

173
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:29,186
that the Adam Strange short was a direct prequel
to Green Lantern Beware My Power. But I'm having

174
00:16:29,246 --> 00:16:34,530
trouble remembering exactly how the House of
Mystery and Command D were referenced in this

175
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:38,973
Crisis on Infinite Earths part 1 movie. Well,
Constantine House of Mystery is a pretty obvious

176
00:16:39,113 --> 00:16:45,692
one. It's the connective tissue between the
DC AMU and the tomorrow verse. At the end,

177
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:50,053
I believe he was punished by the specter, but
I forgot what the punishment was. I guess we

178
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:55,435
see the results of that in this movie when we
see Constantine as an old guy. Yeah, he's forced

179
00:16:55,535 --> 00:17:01,857
to live through the ends of universes. Interesting.
And Comedie has been confirmed to be a part

180
00:17:01,877 --> 00:17:07,514
of this universe as well by the producers. Now,
I wasn't always excited for the Crisis films

181
00:17:07,574 --> 00:17:12,316
this year. In fact, I'd say they were the DC
projects I was looking forward to the least,

182
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:18,818
hands down. Just like as of last week, basically.
But after seeing the bold risk they took with

183
00:17:18,898 --> 00:17:26,020
Part 1 in terms of its unconventional narrative
structure and having it pay off so spectacularly

184
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:32,774
well, I feel like I've glimpsed a genius adaptation
of the source material. Like, I've never seen

185
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:39,061
a superhero film be so hyper-focused on a single
character's perspective of a story. You could

186
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:45,728
say Crisis Part 1 is like the Groundhog Day
or memento of superhero films in that regard,

187
00:17:46,128 --> 00:17:51,493
but the story borrows most heavily from The
Time Traveler's Wife, a book that's been adapted

188
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:56,934
to both a film and television series if you're
not familiar with it. Yeah, as a narrative

189
00:17:56,974 --> 00:18:01,818
device, the time jumping thing got a little
bit grating after a while because it was kind

190
00:18:01,838 --> 00:18:06,122
of hard to tell the overall structure of the
film. Like it didn't have like a clear three

191
00:18:06,282 --> 00:18:11,847
act breakdown. And that can sometimes be a frustrating
experience as a viewer. It did actually have

192
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:17,171
three acts. Well, that was not easy for me to
tell. Well, apparently you're stupid then.

193
00:18:17,732 --> 00:18:23,603
I don't know what else to say. I'll be honest,
when I first got done watching this film, I

194
00:18:23,643 --> 00:18:27,766
couldn't tell you if it was good or not. I knew
that it was interesting, and I do think that

195
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:33,389
it sets up tremendous potential for the overall
trilogy of films. I get the impression that

196
00:18:33,429 --> 00:18:38,151
when all is said and done, the story is going
to be massive and epic in a way that puts even

197
00:18:38,191 --> 00:18:42,674
Apocalypse War to shame. But I just think we
haven't gotten there yet. There was a lot of

198
00:18:42,734 --> 00:18:47,096
like missing context to a lot of what we were
watching, and it sometimes felt confusing in

199
00:18:47,136 --> 00:18:52,987
that regard. But I will admit. that your comparisons
to stories like Memento and The Time Traveler's

200
00:18:53,027 --> 00:18:58,749
Wife have me a little bit more intrigued. Yeah,
honestly, Crisis Part 1 is going to be a film

201
00:18:58,769 --> 00:19:05,171
that you either love or you hate, kind of like
films like Groundhog Day. I think everyone

202
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:10,353
loves The Time Traveler's Wife. It's a love
story, so it may be outside the interest of

203
00:19:10,393 --> 00:19:15,155
our podcast's audience demographics. But if
you're not familiar with it, the time traveler's

204
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:21,321
wife follows a man cursed with a time traveling
condition that causes him to live his life

205
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:28,747
out of linear time. Like he experiences events
in his life in a nonlinear random order, while

206
00:19:28,767 --> 00:19:33,691
the woman he loves struggles to live life with
someone with this condition. In Crisis Part

207
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:39,942
1, about three quarters of the way through the
film, The Flash absorbs the entire speed force

208
00:19:40,082 --> 00:19:45,264
of a universe that was just destroyed by an
antimatter wave traveling through the multiverse,

209
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:52,166
which causes him to experience time non-linearly,
and we as an audience are along for the ride.

210
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:59,228
The film constantly jumps, or time trips, throughout
its story, and it's not until a decent ways

211
00:19:59,268 --> 00:20:05,523
into the film that we begin to grasp what's
going on. Story-wise, the film jumps back in

212
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:10,826
time to tell the story of how the Justice League
first formed. A story we didn't get the chance

213
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:16,549
to see in earlier Tomorrowverse films, which
is something fans had complained about, including

214
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:21,211
myself. Oh yeah, I remember we brought that
up as a criticism of the Tomorrowverse during

215
00:20:21,251 --> 00:20:26,414
the Beware My Power review. Yes. Because the
League was already formed by that movie, but

216
00:20:26,554 --> 00:20:32,097
the only reference we got to the League prior
to that was in Justice Society World War II.

217
00:20:32,746 --> 00:20:35,348
where they're like, oh, maybe we should form
a team or something like that. And then all

218
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:39,851
of a sudden we see it fully formed without any
kind of glimpse into how or why these characters

219
00:20:39,891 --> 00:20:45,075
got together. I was surprised when I saw that
this was, in fact, a Justice League origin

220
00:20:45,215 --> 00:20:49,899
story. Yeah, that was a huge surprise to me
as well. The formation of the Justice League

221
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:55,723
has never been particularly profound, in my
opinion. Basically, a group of heroes get together

222
00:20:55,923 --> 00:21:01,703
to battle a major threat like Starro or Darkseid.
But in this film, the team's formation is a

223
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:09,108
ruse to draw out a life-stealing android named
Amazo, whose own story is more existential

224
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:15,532
and emotional than it needed to be. Like, it
did not need to go that hard. As we learn that

225
00:21:15,572 --> 00:21:21,515
story, we also visit the Earth-3 universe ruled
by an evil version of the Justice League, known

226
00:21:21,555 --> 00:21:27,423
as the Crime Syndicate, and witness that universe's
destruction. which sets up the stakes for the

227
00:21:27,463 --> 00:21:34,408
film's central and final threat. That the multiverse
is being destroyed, universe by universe, and

228
00:21:34,508 --> 00:21:39,852
it being outside of space and time, the monitor
has brought heroes from across the multiverse

229
00:21:39,952 --> 00:21:45,136
to save it. The true heart of the film, though,
comes from the story between Barry and his

230
00:21:45,176 --> 00:21:50,440
wife, Iris, as we see them meet for the first
time shortly after Barry received his powers,

231
00:21:50,941 --> 00:21:56,223
and eventually get married, despite Barry's
inability to experience his life linearly.

232
00:21:56,763 --> 00:22:02,266
In one moment, he's at his wedding, the next
he's on Earth 3, the next he and Iris are old.

233
00:22:02,626 --> 00:22:09,248
The dedication and love that Barry and Iris
have to each other despite their crazy lives

234
00:22:09,709 --> 00:22:15,551
makes Crisis Part 1 arguably one of the most
romantic superhero projects that I've ever

235
00:22:15,611 --> 00:22:19,573
seen. Yeah, at first part of me was like, out
of all the people the Flash could have gotten

236
00:22:19,593 --> 00:22:25,820
to help him build these towers, Why did he go
with someone that's not super powered or like

237
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:30,542
a super genius or something like that? So the
decision was entirely made out of the desire

238
00:22:30,562 --> 00:22:35,785
to spend the rest of his life with this woman
He loves and uh, you know, I could appreciate

239
00:22:35,805 --> 00:22:41,388
that too. Definitely made for a touching twist
on the narrative at the end Absolutely, like

240
00:22:41,629 --> 00:22:46,191
it just made me want to go like hug my wife
You know, hey cool it with the romance man

241
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:52,783
This podcast has a limit on the number of lovey-dovey
things that can be said Alright, there's just

242
00:22:53,263 --> 00:22:58,627
so much that I love about this film, but I can
also see where a lot of people would maybe

243
00:22:58,667 --> 00:23:03,611
be turned off by its haphazard time-jumping,
like you mentioned. It's not exactly the best

244
00:23:03,711 --> 00:23:09,815
plot structure to explain an event as complicated
in itself as the destruction of the multiverse,

245
00:23:10,376 --> 00:23:15,559
so there are multiple barriers to entry for
audiences on top of the barrier that exists

246
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:21,331
naturally in a cinematic universe. Basically,
if you don't watch everything that came before,

247
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:26,894
there's a chance you'll be missing important
information needed to truly understand or appreciate

248
00:23:26,934 --> 00:23:31,637
the current story that you're watching. Marvel
runs into that sometimes. Yeah, more often

249
00:23:31,657 --> 00:23:36,000
than not, the longer your cinematic universe
goes, the more of a chilling effect audiences

250
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,822
are going to have going into it. Exactly. And
the only other gripe that I have about the

251
00:23:40,862 --> 00:23:46,654
film is the animation. Again, the character
designs are great for the most part. Although

252
00:23:46,714 --> 00:23:51,435
actually there were a few I was really unhappy
with in this film. But the animation leaves

253
00:23:51,475 --> 00:23:56,856
a lot to be desired. Like there are some scenes
that felt like old school super friends cartoons,

254
00:23:56,976 --> 00:24:02,498
where the entire frame is still except for characters'
mouths moving. Yeah, the tomorrowverse is largely

255
00:24:02,538 --> 00:24:07,119
computer animated and sometimes it can be done
to great effect like in the Batman the Long

256
00:24:07,139 --> 00:24:12,621
Halloween films. This was nothing like that.
Like, sometimes these characters would not

257
00:24:12,681 --> 00:24:17,163
blink and they were just staring. like not even
making direct eye contact with who they were

258
00:24:17,183 --> 00:24:22,167
talking to, and they look like soulless abominations.
But I just think it's probably an issue of

259
00:24:22,247 --> 00:24:27,452
timing with the animators. They probably didn't
have enough time to actually add all the subtle

260
00:24:27,512 --> 00:24:32,976
quirks and eye movements and things like that
when producing this film. Maybe, yeah, maybe

261
00:24:33,036 --> 00:24:38,200
for certain characters over others, that's probably
true. Now the film is nowhere near as dynamic

262
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:44,285
as it needs to be. But at least for me personally,
the story made up for a lot of the film's drawbacks.

263
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:50,833
Though the film features a large cast of DC
characters, it focuses solely on the experiences

264
00:24:51,013 --> 00:24:56,597
of one. So there's not many characters to really
dive into for our character breakdown, but

265
00:24:56,617 --> 00:25:02,841
let's start with The Flash. Now The Flash, aka
Barry Allen, was voiced by Matt Bomer. Now

266
00:25:02,881 --> 00:25:08,344
Matt isn't just a fantastic voice actor, but
a great actor in his own right. And as such,

267
00:25:08,504 --> 00:25:13,676
he is fantastic at capturing emotion. I have
to give major credit to the filmmakers for

268
00:25:13,716 --> 00:25:18,980
making the decision to get an actor as talented
as Matt Bomer to successfully kick off this

269
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:25,466
three film conclusion to a cinematic universe.
The end of a story should be bittersweet, and

270
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:30,951
Matt Bomer definitely helped make The Flash's
ending bittersweet and heartfelt. Yeah, I mean,

271
00:25:31,231 --> 00:25:37,137
we saw him portray the character of the Negative
Man largely in voice alone for the Doom Patrol

272
00:25:37,157 --> 00:25:42,460
television series. It does amaze me how different
his voice acting is here for the character

273
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,643
of Barry Allen. The guy is super talented. Yeah,
for sure. Yeah, his negative man was so like

274
00:25:47,743 --> 00:25:54,387
melancholic, whereas his Barry is much more
bright. Now for a film in which so many things

275
00:25:54,447 --> 00:26:00,371
happen, the character of Barry Allen is relatively
static. And that's in part because everything

276
00:26:00,411 --> 00:26:06,427
he experiences, whether it be the first time
he met his wife or his wedding, He's experiencing

277
00:26:06,507 --> 00:26:11,611
as someone who already knows what's going to
happen because he's been to the future. What

278
00:26:11,631 --> 00:26:16,575
makes him interesting in this film is when he
is put in situations that we don't yet know

279
00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:21,379
how he's going to get out of it. Whether it's
going up against a mezzo or escaping Earth

280
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:28,264
3 or preventing the destruction of his universe.
In the comics, the Flash sacrificed his life

281
00:26:28,344 --> 00:26:34,448
to help save the multiverse. And while he does
the same in this film, it's incredibly touching

282
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:39,792
that they still found a way for him to live
out an entire lifetime with his wife Iris happily

283
00:26:39,972 --> 00:26:47,097
and with no regrets. And the fact that his last
moments existing in time in his universe was

284
00:26:47,197 --> 00:26:53,222
at his wedding reception celebrating with the
rest of Earth's heroes is like the greatest

285
00:26:53,302 --> 00:26:59,838
of honors. It literally brought tears to my
eyes and I can think of no ending greater for

286
00:26:59,858 --> 00:27:05,599
a hero as important to the comics as The Flash.
Yeah, the narrative approach that he took with

287
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:10,641
The Flash does make me question some things,
particularly when we've seen the character

288
00:27:10,681 --> 00:27:16,483
in previous movies such as Justice Society World
War II, where we know that he still experienced

289
00:27:16,523 --> 00:27:21,004
time linearly throughout the course of that
entire adventure, the time traveling notwithstanding.

290
00:27:21,184 --> 00:27:26,805
Yeah, that's a good question. Like at what point
in his life did he start time tripping? And

291
00:27:26,885 --> 00:27:31,099
it- seems like it really kicks in around the
time of the formation of the Justice League.

292
00:27:31,499 --> 00:27:35,620
Though honestly, parts of it go back to even
before that to, you know, when he first gets

293
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,802
his powers. Exactly. So that's a little bit
strange. I do think that they could have effectively

294
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:46,263
told the same story with about 25% less time
jumping because at some point I got really

295
00:27:46,323 --> 00:27:50,665
sick and tired of seeing that graphic of the
Speed Force tunnel thing. I'm like, oh my God,

296
00:27:50,685 --> 00:27:57,092
just stop. Just little touches, like what you
mentioned about him spending some of his last

297
00:27:57,152 --> 00:28:02,115
moments dancing with his wife at his wedding.
That's just poetry. So there's a lot of kind

298
00:28:02,135 --> 00:28:06,377
of like back and forth, the things that I really
like and things that I don't really care for.

299
00:28:06,577 --> 00:28:11,080
But overall, as a concept, I really appreciate
where they were trying to go with it. Yeah,

300
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:16,363
it's ambitious for sure. Now the only other
character I have anything to dive into with

301
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:22,930
is Amazo. He was voiced by Nolan North, who
also did the voice. for John Constantine and

302
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:28,992
Hal Jordan in this movie. He's a voice actor
and a damn good one. No, Amazo was created

303
00:28:29,032 --> 00:28:36,455
by Dr. Anthony Ivo for the sole purpose of extending
human life. Ivo was a scientist for LexCorp

304
00:28:36,635 --> 00:28:43,846
and when Lex purposefully gave Ivo Hutchinson-Gilford
syndrome, causing him to age rapidly. Ivo created

305
00:28:43,886 --> 00:28:50,308
Imezo with the ability to absorb, store, and
redirect energy in order to restore vitality

306
00:28:50,348 --> 00:28:56,551
to the dying and the sick. Lex, however, corrupted
Imezo's programming so that he was capable

307
00:28:56,591 --> 00:29:02,673
of absorbing and using metahuman energy, granting
him the powers of Superman and the Flash, among

308
00:29:02,814 --> 00:29:08,856
others. Imezo's always been a considerable threat
for the Justice League, so I thought having

309
00:29:08,896 --> 00:29:14,498
him be the catalyst for the formation of the
League was a good choice. But the heroes initially

310
00:29:14,598 --> 00:29:20,160
formed the Justice League during a public address
as a way to draw out a mezzo to them, though

311
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:26,063
it also brought Lex Luthor in an awfully designed
mech suit. Yeah, that was horrible looking.

312
00:29:27,083 --> 00:29:32,045
It was cool to see Lex continue his journey
from the Man of Tomorrow movie, but it was

313
00:29:32,085 --> 00:29:37,448
also a little bit convoluted considering he
had this scientist who he gave this really

314
00:29:37,508 --> 00:29:42,698
rare disease to and he probably could have just
given him cancer or something like that. and

315
00:29:42,738 --> 00:29:48,219
he had him build a benevolent android who really
struggled with Lex's commands. You would think

316
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:51,380
that Lex could almost just build this thing
himself. I don't know. It was a little bit

317
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:55,181
strange there, but it was cool to see Zachary
Quinto in the role again. Yeah, he's great

318
00:29:55,221 --> 00:30:01,563
as Lex. I think it was implied that Ivo was
a prodigy and that the creation of an AI as

319
00:30:01,663 --> 00:30:08,865
evolved as Amazo was, was outside of Lex's abilities.
But that's just a guess. Yeah, this was a much

320
00:30:08,925 --> 00:30:13,080
different- version of a Mazer than the one that
we saw in Batman under the Red Hood, right?

321
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:18,103
Yes. Yeah, very much so. Because in that movie,
Batman was able to defeat the Mazer with some

322
00:30:18,163 --> 00:30:25,348
explosives, if I recall correctly. Which is
bullcrap. But yeah, I loved how they used parasite

323
00:30:25,468 --> 00:30:30,772
alien technology to give a Mazer his like absorbing
powers. I thought that was smart. That makes

324
00:30:30,792 --> 00:30:37,376
sense. Yeah, that tighted well. I do have to
wonder, though, as well, like Lex's mech suit

325
00:30:37,657 --> 00:30:44,251
almost looks like a metallo. Like, if they were
selling that as a prototype for maybe a later

326
00:30:44,371 --> 00:30:48,532
version of Botelo, I could totally buy that.
That's really the only reasoning I'll accept

327
00:30:48,572 --> 00:30:53,894
for why his suit looked so damn bad. Now when
The Flash realizes that Amazo's been corrupted

328
00:30:53,954 --> 00:31:01,416
by Lex and he brings Dr. Ivo to him, Amazo attempts
to heal Ivo using the metahuman energy that

329
00:31:01,456 --> 00:31:09,031
he had absorbed. When that ended up killing
the frail Ivo instead, the subtle acting quote-unquote

330
00:31:09,051 --> 00:31:15,615
by Amazo was incredible. Like the android was
so profoundly shocked by betraying the very

331
00:31:15,715 --> 00:31:21,339
reason for his existence and accidentally killing
his creator, he could barely complete a sentence.

332
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:27,804
It just broke him. The fact that Amazo was brought
back online by the Flash to help him and Iris

333
00:31:27,824 --> 00:31:34,088
complete the frequency tower and save the multiverse
at the end, allowing Amazo to fulfill his programming

334
00:31:34,148 --> 00:31:40,721
before being destroyed, also cut me super deep
to my core. Like for a character to go from

335
00:31:40,781 --> 00:31:47,726
the deepest valley of regret to the utmost peak
of fulfillment in his last moment was surprisingly

336
00:31:47,886 --> 00:31:53,918
more cathartic than I thought it'd be. And this
is just part one. Yeah, as the story was going

337
00:31:54,018 --> 00:31:59,740
on, I wasn't quite sure why they felt the need
to include Amazo in this particular story,

338
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:06,862
because I wasn't sure it made sense thematically
with the idea of the multiverse ending. By

339
00:32:06,902 --> 00:32:11,603
the end it was clear that they included Amazo
because they wanted to tell the story of him

340
00:32:11,724 --> 00:32:17,125
fulfilling his programming. I'm not entirely
sure it was necessary though. Why did they

341
00:32:17,165 --> 00:32:22,661
need Amazo? who I wasn't even aware was filled
in on the frequency tower schematics or anything

342
00:32:22,701 --> 00:32:26,243
like that or what he had to do with that. Like,
Iris and Flash could have built that tower

343
00:32:26,263 --> 00:32:31,267
themselves. Probably, it probably would have
taken them a lot longer to do it without Amazo,

344
00:32:31,307 --> 00:32:37,351
considering they're not engineers and Amazo
is a super intelligent AI. You could argue

345
00:32:37,391 --> 00:32:41,874
that he wasn't necessary to the story, but I
actually really like that they were able to

346
00:32:41,954 --> 00:32:47,795
introduce him again as the threat that resulted
in the formation of the League. but also coming

347
00:32:47,835 --> 00:32:52,983
full circle to have him be the one that helps
save humanity at the end of the movie. It's

348
00:32:53,023 --> 00:32:57,289
just good writing. And with that said, let's
move on to our story highlights.

349
00:33:04,494 --> 00:33:08,977
The film begins with Barry Allen, the Flash,
running through the time stream, observing

350
00:33:09,017 --> 00:33:14,202
himself on the night he got his powers in a
lab accident and met his future wife, Iris

351
00:33:14,262 --> 00:33:19,887
West. Barry time trips farther along the time
stream to when he and Superman first encountered

352
00:33:20,007 --> 00:33:26,573
the energy-stealing android villain, Amazo,
created by Dr. Anthony Ivo for LexCorp. When

353
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:32,326
Flash and Superman become too weak to face Amazo,
Green Arrow comes to their rescue. and he and

354
00:33:32,366 --> 00:33:37,731
Flash take Superman to the home of Bruce Wayne
on Halloween night to recover. Now remember

355
00:33:37,771 --> 00:33:42,035
when we were talking about the post credits
scene of Batman the Long Halloween Part 2 and

356
00:33:42,075 --> 00:33:46,119
we were like, what? Flash and Green Arrow? What
does that mean? That was a horrible ending.

357
00:33:46,499 --> 00:33:51,944
Well now we see how that scene came about. Barry
time trips to when he and Iris meet a destitute

358
00:33:51,964 --> 00:33:57,822
John Constantine who is responsible for some
of Flash's time trips. Barry then travels to

359
00:33:57,842 --> 00:34:03,764
when he first meets Dick Grayson and encourages
Bruce Wayne to foster him. We then jump back

360
00:34:03,804 --> 00:34:08,926
in time to when Superman is recovering in the
Batcave before Flash, Superman, Batman, and

361
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:14,648
Green Arrow decide to form a team to face a
mezzo that includes Vixen and Martian Manhunter.

362
00:34:14,808 --> 00:34:19,891
When they try to recruit the Green Lantern Hale
Jordan, Hale rejects the team and Constantine

363
00:34:19,911 --> 00:34:25,313
appears again telling the Flash that he must
bear witness before sending him to the parallel

364
00:34:25,453 --> 00:34:30,247
universe of Earth 3. Hal Jordan was kind of
a dick throughout the entire tomorrow verse,

365
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:36,430
right? Even in the Green Lantern Beware My Power
movie, he became Parallax and was evil and

366
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:41,152
shit, you know? And here he was just like, I'm
already part of a team, screw you guys. It

367
00:34:41,172 --> 00:34:46,514
was nice to see Jon Stewart get his due as a
character though, within this universe. I like

368
00:34:46,534 --> 00:34:51,597
that the focus was on him as the resident Green
Lantern. Yeah, I'm sure a lot of fans also

369
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:57,179
liked at the very end of the film. during Barry
and Iris' wedding when Jon Stewart and Hawke

370
00:34:57,219 --> 00:35:01,561
Girl ended up dancing together. Because that
of course goes back to the Bruce Tim verse,

371
00:35:01,701 --> 00:35:06,043
or whatever that's called. That's called the
DCAU, which incorporates Batman the Animated

372
00:35:06,083 --> 00:35:11,325
Series, Superman the Animated Series, and Justice
League. And Justice League Unlimited. Now after

373
00:35:11,385 --> 00:35:16,907
encountering Johnny Quick and the Crime Syndicate,
Flash realizes that he's in a new universe

374
00:35:17,187 --> 00:35:22,489
before getting pummeled by its evil doppelganger
version of the Justice League, the Crime Syndicate.

375
00:35:22,978 --> 00:35:28,019
Flash trips back to his universe when he and
his allies announce the Justice League team

376
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:33,420
to the world, just before they're attacked by
Amazo and Lex Luthor, the latter of whom is

377
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:39,242
wearing a mech suit. During the battle, Amazo
uses the speed he's absorbed from the Flash

378
00:35:39,542 --> 00:35:44,643
to have a conversation with the speedster with
time at a near standstill, explaining that

379
00:35:44,663 --> 00:35:49,945
he was programmed to extend human life, but
that Lex Luthor had corrupted his programming.

380
00:35:52,886 --> 00:35:58,487
but accidentally time trips back to Earth 3
instead. While on Earth 3, Flash discovers

381
00:35:58,527 --> 00:36:03,148
that it's ruled by evil counterparts to the
heroes of his world, and the Crime Syndicate

382
00:36:03,188 --> 00:36:08,810
learns of the potential for other Earths and
parallel universes that they can conquer. Flash

383
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:13,911
also learns that sharing the Speed Force with
the evil Speedster Johnny Quick prevents him

384
00:36:13,951 --> 00:36:20,113
from gaining enough speed to return to his universe.
However, the decrepit Constantine appears and

385
00:36:20,173 --> 00:36:25,616
warns the Syndicate, that their universe is
about to be destroyed. Flash time trips back

386
00:36:25,656 --> 00:36:30,560
to his universe on the day of his wedding when
he warns Iris that something major is going

387
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:36,224
to happen but also promises that no matter what
they will grow old together. Time tripping

388
00:36:36,364 --> 00:36:42,589
back to the past, the Flash finds Dr. Ivo at
LexCorp learning that Ivo created a mezzo using

389
00:36:42,729 --> 00:36:47,852
alien technology with the intention of curing
Kiss Hutchinson-Gilford syndrome which caused

390
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:53,853
Ivo to age rapidly. As the Flash races Ivo back
to the Justice League's battle with the Meizou,

391
00:36:54,333 --> 00:37:00,197
Flash time trips back to his time on Earth 3.
At this point in the story, I'm wondering what

392
00:37:00,237 --> 00:37:05,081
the point of everything is, because it's just
the nature of the narrative device of time

393
00:37:05,121 --> 00:37:09,985
skipping. It's really hard to make heads or
tails of not just what's going on, but why

394
00:37:10,025 --> 00:37:14,155
things are happening. You know, it's easy to
assume in films like these that it's all going

395
00:37:14,175 --> 00:37:18,518
to come together at the end, like the movie
Memento. But it definitely feels like the movie

396
00:37:18,558 --> 00:37:23,401
starts to drag at some points because you don't
quite know where it's going. Actually, when

397
00:37:23,481 --> 00:37:29,104
I was watching this film for the first time,
the whole movie felt very quick to me. Like

398
00:37:29,184 --> 00:37:33,227
everything was happening at such a rapid pace
that by the time the movie was over, I was

399
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:38,129
like, really? That was 90 minutes? But yeah,
it was. I had the opposite experience. Really?

400
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,992
Yeah, but halfway through the movie, I was like,
shouldn't this thing be over by now? And then

401
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:47,616
I checked the time code and realized it was
only halfway done. Geez. It's strange that

402
00:37:47,676 --> 00:37:52,319
we experience time differently while watching
this movie. Honestly, I don't think you could

403
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:57,422
think this movie was slow. Like, I can get like
being confused by what's going on, because

404
00:37:57,582 --> 00:38:02,125
there certainly was a time towards the beginning
of the film where I didn't realize what was

405
00:38:02,145 --> 00:38:06,909
going on either. But I caught on pretty quick
and it was, you know, just enjoying the ride.

406
00:38:07,169 --> 00:38:12,743
Maybe that's the difference. I enjoy rides.
You don't apparently. Yeah, you get motion

407
00:38:12,763 --> 00:38:20,026
sick. There you go. Now on Earth 3, Flash watches
as the crime syndicate proves to be incapable

408
00:38:20,067 --> 00:38:26,569
of managing the turmoil caused by violent storms
across the planet. When Flash asks how Constantine

409
00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:31,591
is appearing in different universes, Constantine
explains that he and Flash are guilty of a

410
00:38:31,652 --> 00:38:36,514
heinous act. We time trip back in time to the
Justice League's battle with the Mezzo. and

411
00:38:36,554 --> 00:38:42,836
the League members fall one by one. With Amazo
and Lex nearly victorious, Flash arrives with

412
00:38:43,036 --> 00:38:49,840
Ivo, who asks Amazo to use the metahuman energy
he absorbed to cure him. Amazo's attempt to

413
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:56,623
do so fails, and Ivo dies. With his primary
objective made obsolete, the shocked Amazo

414
00:38:56,683 --> 00:39:02,805
deduces that Lex is the one who inflicted Ivo
with the disease. Amazo destroys Lex's mech

415
00:39:02,865 --> 00:39:08,878
suit. though Flash stops Amazo before he can
kill his former ally. Once Lex is apprehended

416
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:14,462
by the authorities, it's revealed that the formation
of the Justice League was a ruse to draw out

417
00:39:14,542 --> 00:39:20,307
Amazo, but the heroes decide to make the League
a reality after all. Am I the only one that

418
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:25,291
thought that Batman maybe had a point in his
approach? You know, clear all the innocent

419
00:39:25,311 --> 00:39:30,859
civilians out, but then just bomb the hell out
of Lex Luthor. Everybody was like, no, you

420
00:39:30,879 --> 00:39:36,783
can't do it. You can't bomb the city. But it's
like this guy's super powerful. You clearly

421
00:39:36,823 --> 00:39:42,807
can't let a mezzo steal Superman's powers because
that's worse than a bomb. So I don't know why

422
00:39:43,027 --> 00:39:47,510
they were getting all up. Batman's asked for.
Well, I mean, Flash ultimately proved that

423
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:52,013
he had a better solution. Yeah. But like, I
don't know, the other heroes were just annoying

424
00:39:52,053 --> 00:39:57,897
me. You're on the wrong side of history there.
Literally. Yeah. Time tripping ahead in the

425
00:39:57,957 --> 00:40:03,212
timeline. We see an older Barry and Iris wake
up to celebrate the anniversary of the first

426
00:40:03,232 --> 00:40:09,135
day they met, before we trip back to the day
of their wedding, which is interrupted by Harbinger,

427
00:40:09,455 --> 00:40:14,718
who is recruiting heroes for the Monitor to
save the multiverse. On the Monitor's ship

428
00:40:14,818 --> 00:40:20,302
outside of space-time, heroes from across the
multiverse and time begin appearing, including

429
00:40:20,442 --> 00:40:27,405
Wonder Woman, Robin, Huntress, Dr. Light, and
Psycho Pirates, among others. Harbinger reveals,

430
00:40:27,638 --> 00:40:32,880
that she is actually Supergirl to the future
hero Dawnstar of the Legion of Superheroes.

431
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:38,742
The Monitor arrives and reveals to the heroes
that a wave of antimatter is ripping through

432
00:40:38,762 --> 00:40:43,585
the multiverse, destroying entire universes,
and that they have been brought together to

433
00:40:43,645 --> 00:40:49,867
stop it. Barry time trips to the future when
an elderly version of himself and Iris continue

434
00:40:49,887 --> 00:40:56,026
to work on a mysterious project. Before Barry
trips again to Earth 3, where he witnesses

435
00:40:56,046 --> 00:41:02,209
the antimatter wave begin to erase that universe.
Tripping back to the monitor ship, the flash

436
00:41:02,249 --> 00:41:07,011
reveals that the monitor is telling the truth
and that the threat of the antimatter wave

437
00:41:07,151 --> 00:41:11,653
is real. Did you get the feeling when Harbinger
showed up in the movie that finally they're

438
00:41:11,673 --> 00:41:16,395
getting to the story of Crisis on Infinite Earths?
Like, it seemed a little bit late within the

439
00:41:16,455 --> 00:41:22,178
runtime to start introducing those elements,
right? Honestly, I wasn't sure how- the formation

440
00:41:22,218 --> 00:41:29,180
of the League was going to tie into the crisis.
So I actually wasn't thinking that. As I mentioned

441
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,882
earlier, there are like three distinct sort
of conflicts going on throughout the course

442
00:41:33,902 --> 00:41:40,024
of this movie. One is a mezzo, one is the crime
syndicate, and one is the antimatter wave.

443
00:41:40,444 --> 00:41:45,365
It's true that the antimatter wave storyline
doesn't really begin until halfway through

444
00:41:45,385 --> 00:41:50,663
the film. But again, everything was just moving
so fast that it didn't feel like the halfway

445
00:41:50,703 --> 00:41:54,365
point to me. This is the first part of a trilogy.
It's not like they were going to go through

446
00:41:54,405 --> 00:41:59,447
the entire crisis storyline just in this movie.
I figured it was going to be delayed. I figured

447
00:41:59,487 --> 00:42:06,930
there was going to be some setup. Well, fine.
As Earth 3 is entirely destroyed by the wave,

448
00:42:07,271 --> 00:42:12,653
the death of Johnny Quick allows Flash to gain
enough speed force to return to his universe.

449
00:42:13,213 --> 00:42:19,433
In the future, It's revealed that Amazo is helping
the elderly Barry and Iris on their project.

450
00:42:19,994 --> 00:42:25,838
On the monitor ship, the heroes decide to split
into two teams. One to determine a solution

451
00:42:26,078 --> 00:42:31,281
and one to build it. During their brainstorm
session, Flash reveals that absorbing the entirety

452
00:42:31,321 --> 00:42:37,246
of the speed force of the Earth 3 universe upon
its demise knocked him out of his linear time

453
00:42:37,286 --> 00:42:43,822
experience. When the heroes learn that the Flash
is able to traverse the multiverse, by vibrating

454
00:42:43,962 --> 00:42:50,165
into different planes of existence, they determine
that colossal tuning fork towers built on their

455
00:42:50,305 --> 00:42:56,627
earths could vibrate their universes to a state
of intangibility when the wave strikes. As

456
00:42:56,647 --> 00:43:03,210
the heroes begin building the towers, it's revealed
that the elderly Barry, Iris, and Amazo are

457
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:08,112
working on building one of those towers. Now
the reason they have to do that is because

458
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:13,354
the flash needs to slow down time due to the
wave moving quicker. which was not foreseen

459
00:43:13,574 --> 00:43:18,798
by the heroes when they were building the towers.
But the story never reveals why the wave moved

460
00:43:18,858 --> 00:43:23,500
quicker all of a sudden. I'm assuming that they're
going to touch on that in later films. Yes,

461
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:30,404
I got the implication that this whole thing
is a product of the monitor based on his conversation

462
00:43:30,424 --> 00:43:34,687
with the specter that we'll talk about later
on. But I could be wrong. There still could

463
00:43:34,727 --> 00:43:40,378
be an anti-monitor. Who was the villain of the
crisis story in the comics? Yes, exactly. As

464
00:43:40,418 --> 00:43:45,361
the heroes build, they're shocked to discover
the wave has arrived ahead of schedule. The

465
00:43:45,401 --> 00:43:51,644
Flash encounters Constantine, who tells him
to run to Iris. With Iris in his arms, the

466
00:43:51,685 --> 00:43:57,588
Flash imbues her with enough speed force energy
that the two are able to move with time essentially

467
00:43:57,648 --> 00:44:03,151
at a standstill, allowing them to complete the
construction of the tower over the span of

468
00:44:03,231 --> 00:44:10,568
relative decades. As the anti-manager wave slowly
approaches, The elderly Iris dies from old

469
00:44:10,768 --> 00:44:16,553
age, just as they finish work on the tower.
As the elderly Barry charges up the tower by

470
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:23,198
running on a power generating turbine, the heroes
experiencing time normally watch as the tower

471
00:44:23,278 --> 00:44:30,144
is constructed at rapid speed before them just
as the wave hits. Though the tower is destroyed

472
00:44:30,224 --> 00:44:35,689
as the wave passes over, the tower's frequency
was successfully transmitted throughout the

473
00:44:35,729 --> 00:44:42,115
multiverse. saving countless Earths. Infinite
Earths? Maybe not infinite, but a whole hell

474
00:44:42,155 --> 00:44:48,037
of a lot. I'm calling bullshit on the marketing.
Ha ha ha. The Spectre meets with the Monitor,

475
00:44:48,137 --> 00:44:53,578
who has determined that his experiment was a
success, though he was doubtful it would be.

476
00:44:53,999 --> 00:44:59,960
The Spectre then visits the elderly Barry and
reveals that a mezzo now destroyed knew he

477
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,710
had succeeded in his mission to extend human
life in his last moment. The specter also reveals

478
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:11,413
that though he is an agent of God's wrath, Barry
has atoned for his responsibility in helping

479
00:45:11,573 --> 00:45:18,236
cause the events that had transpired. As the
Speed Force absorbs Barry into it, in his final

480
00:45:18,276 --> 00:45:24,078
moments he's able to warn his younger self the
day of his accident and Bruce Wayne and Warlord

481
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:30,201
that they must go back to before the beginning.
We see that on the day of Barry's and Iris's

482
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:35,535
wedding, Harbinger brought all of the heroes
of this world to celebrate together with them

483
00:45:35,935 --> 00:45:41,437
before embarking on the monitor's mission to
save the multiverse. In the final scene, as

484
00:45:41,477 --> 00:45:46,338
the heroes celebrate on the monitor's ship,
we see that their actions have affected the

485
00:45:46,398 --> 00:45:52,400
timeline and characters from the future such
as Don Star and Brainiac 5 begin to disappear.

486
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:57,301
And that's why it's interesting that Batman
Beyond is in the trailer for the next film.

487
00:45:57,810 --> 00:46:01,933
I didn't make the connection that it was just
characters from the future that were blipping,

488
00:46:02,434 --> 00:46:05,957
and it looked like they were being blipped.
I thought it was just like random characters.

489
00:46:06,037 --> 00:46:11,522
Oh really? You probably were like, what an Infinity
War ripoff. Right. But I guess it was made

490
00:46:11,622 --> 00:46:17,019
clear by what Brainiac 5 told Supergirl at the
very end. I thought it was a very strange ending

491
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:20,501
though. Considering that the main character
for the whole film was the Flash, we didn't

492
00:46:20,621 --> 00:46:24,783
end with the Flash. The story seemed to kick
over to Supergirl at that point, which makes

493
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:30,287
me feel like this scene is also going to be
the beginning to part 2. We did end with the

494
00:46:30,307 --> 00:46:35,029
Flash though. He died. He merged with the Speed
Force. No, the very last shot of this movie

495
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:39,632
was Brainiac 5 disappearing. Right, I know,
but that's just set up for the next film. You

496
00:46:39,652 --> 00:46:42,934
were saying that you were surprised it didn't
end with the Flash. And I'm saying, what the

497
00:46:43,014 --> 00:46:48,157
fuck, of course they would set up the next movie,
it's a fucking trilogy. But they didn't need

498
00:46:48,197 --> 00:46:52,339
to. These final moments seem to stem more out
of their need to set up a cliffhanger than

499
00:46:52,399 --> 00:46:56,801
anything else. It just didn't feel as satisfying
an ending as if they had just chose to end

500
00:46:56,862 --> 00:47:02,445
with The Flash. It's part one of a fucking trilogy,
it doesn't need to be satisfying. It should

501
00:47:02,785 --> 00:47:07,827
set up the next film, it should make you eager
for the continued storyline. I don't think

502
00:47:07,847 --> 00:47:12,578
they needed to end it with just The Flash. I'm
actually pretty intrigued. by how they ended

503
00:47:12,618 --> 00:47:18,443
it because it continues the conflict, right?
There's more story to be told. What threw me

504
00:47:18,543 --> 00:47:24,608
at the end of this, actually, was the whole
Bruce Wayne on Skartaris scene, because I was

505
00:47:24,648 --> 00:47:32,254
under the impression that was just a hallucination
induced by War World. And I'm wondering if

506
00:47:32,274 --> 00:47:38,019
they're implying that, actually, that was a
real universe. That wouldn't make sense, because

507
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:45,208
War World doesn't have time travel. portal capabilities.
No, it did. Actually, they said in the Warworld

508
00:47:45,248 --> 00:47:50,691
film that Mongol had been scouring the multiverse
on Warworld. So, you're saying that Wonder

509
00:47:50,731 --> 00:47:55,894
Woman actually went to the Wild West and Superman
actually went to the 1950s. I mean, I think

510
00:47:55,934 --> 00:48:03,098
that's what this implies. No, I don't think
so. Okay, I mean, why not? Why not? I guess

511
00:48:03,118 --> 00:48:08,481
we'll find out in future films. Again, we have
no idea when they're coming, but I'm looking

512
00:48:08,501 --> 00:48:14,392
forward to them. because this film was really
good in my opinion. Its unconventional narrative

513
00:48:14,432 --> 00:48:20,474
structure ultimately pays off as its emotional
ending sets up the promise of a fascinating

514
00:48:20,514 --> 00:48:25,676
conclusion to this animated universe. The film
wasn't perfect and I know it's going to put

515
00:48:25,776 --> 00:48:34,280
off a lot of people, so I'm giving it 3.5 out
of 5 stars. A fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

516
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:39,318
And actually to your credit Joseph, you had
to talk me down from giving it 4 stars. It's

517
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:43,521
definitely not a four star film. It's going
to be divisive. I think it raises a lot of

518
00:48:43,561 --> 00:48:48,285
questions while you're watching it and can be
frustrating, which is not a great movie going

519
00:48:48,346 --> 00:48:53,610
experience. I think what it tried to do is better
in concept than what it did in practice. As

520
00:48:53,630 --> 00:48:59,695
can be said for the rest of the Tomorrowverse.
Oh, for sure. Yeah, I think at least each concept

521
00:48:59,715 --> 00:49:03,999
that each movie set up in the Tomorrowverse
had potential. And honestly, the best thing

522
00:49:04,019 --> 00:49:09,558
that you can say about Crisis Part One is that
the potential stories that it has set up for

523
00:49:09,598 --> 00:49:14,720
parts two and part three look to be epic as
hell. And I really hope that the tomorrow verse

524
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:19,741
is able to stick this landing and end in a great
way. Yeah, I hope they will. You know, honestly,

525
00:49:19,781 --> 00:49:25,763
if they take more bold swings like what they
did here, I'm all for it, honestly. And I just

526
00:49:25,783 --> 00:49:31,005
have to appreciate the ambition it took to do
something like crisis part one, because not

527
00:49:31,105 --> 00:49:36,899
only did it tell a really good story. unconventional
as it was. They also showed a little bit of

528
00:49:36,919 --> 00:49:41,702
genius when it came to how they're adapting
this crisis story. But that does it for this
