00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:31,407
Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we review
superhero films and debate the superiority

3
00:00:31,447 --> 00:00:37,332
between Marvel and DC by comparing their characters
in stat-based battle simulations. I'm Johnny

4
00:00:37,372 --> 00:00:43,518
DC. And I'm his twin brother Marvelous Joe.
And in this episode, we are reviewing the Disney

5
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:49,663
Plus Marvel series, Secret Invasion. Not a bad
series. I see a lot of hate for it online.

6
00:00:50,004 --> 00:00:54,943
I feel like I liked it more than most people.
I feel like I liked it less than you, which

7
00:00:54,983 --> 00:01:00,086
is strange because I'm the Marvel guy, you're
the DC guy. I don't know where the disconnect

8
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:04,328
is, but we'll talk about it later on this episode.
Right. Before then, we're going to break down

9
00:01:04,368 --> 00:01:10,272
the comic book movie news from the past week,
which there isn't much news with ongoing writers

10
00:01:10,412 --> 00:01:16,115
and actor strikes. We did learn that Sony has
delayed Craven and Spider-Man Beyond the Spider-Verse,

11
00:01:16,615 --> 00:01:21,126
and they have given Venom 3 a release date.
So we're going to talk about that. As always,

12
00:01:21,146 --> 00:01:25,210
we list our segment times in our episode description,
so feel free to check out the show notes if

13
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,814
you want to skip ahead to a particular topic.
As our listeners may know, our duel simulator

14
00:01:29,854 --> 00:01:35,759
has become so advanced that it's gained sentience
and has named itself the Artificial Lifeform

15
00:01:35,779 --> 00:01:43,266
for Running Extensive Duels, just a rather very
intelligent simulator 9000 or Alfred Jarvis

16
00:01:43,326 --> 00:01:50,971
9000. Here's a quick message for our listeners,
so listen up. Why hello there. Do you love

2nd to see who would win between Jack Black's

31
00:03:04,551 --> 00:03:08,772
Nacho Libre versus Jean-Claude Van Damme's Frank
Dukes from Bloodsport. We totally got that

32
00:03:08,792 --> 00:03:13,653
wrong in our last episode. We said that was
going to come out last week, but last week's

33
00:03:13,673 --> 00:03:20,463
episode was Spartacus versus Zorro, which was
awesome. Also debuting this week is the new

34
00:03:20,563 --> 00:03:27,366
Dynamike Network show, Senjoworld, hosted by
executive producer of this show, Zachary Hepburn.

35
00:03:27,846 --> 00:03:32,948
Senjow is the Japanese word for battlefield,
and in the show, Zach is going to tell you

36
00:03:33,008 --> 00:03:37,890
who would win in a fight between your favorite
anime characters. So if you're a fan of anime,

37
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,912
be ready to check out Senjoworld, launching
August 3rd. Click on the link in our show notes

39
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:57,102
the way, quick to the no prize. A no prize is
an award Marvel used to give out to fans. Our

40
00:03:57,142 --> 00:04:02,324
version, the dynamic dual no prize, is a digital
award we post on Instagram and in our email

41
00:04:02,364 --> 00:04:06,226
newsletter for the person that we feel gave
the best answer to our question of the week.

42
00:04:06,586 --> 00:04:12,768
Last week we asked what DC Comics storyline
that hasn't been adapted to an animated film

43
00:04:13,088 --> 00:04:18,147
would you like to see adapted and why? This
of course was coming off the news that Watchmen

44
00:04:18,227 --> 00:04:24,651
and Crisis on Infinite Earths were announced
as animated movies for 2024 next year at Comic

45
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:29,014
Con. We got so many answers. We got too many
fucking answers. We got way too many answers.

46
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:34,358
All you DC guys came out in droves to give your
opinion. It was too many. It was impossible

47
00:04:34,398 --> 00:04:38,921
to pick. They were all great answers, but I
guess ultimately we just had to pick the ones

48
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:43,945
I think we prioritize if we were in charge,
I guess. But any of the answers we got could

49
00:04:43,965 --> 00:04:48,443
work as an animated film. Let's break down this
week's honorable mentions before revealing

50
00:04:48,483 --> 00:04:55,165
the no prize winner. Our first honorable mention
goes to CJ Kraft, who said, Hey guys, CJ Kraft

51
00:04:55,205 --> 00:04:59,967
here. Been loving the latest dual matchups,
some of the best episodes yet. Actually after

52
00:05:00,007 --> 00:05:04,389
listening to the latest episode, I think I'd
want to see an animated film of the Monkey

53
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:09,391
Prince. His powers would lend really well to
animation, and if they did something like Batman

54
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:14,413
Ninja, the art itself could be spectacular.
Have a good one guys, and keep up the great

55
00:05:14,453 --> 00:05:19,383
work. Hey, thanks, CJ. I loved Batman Ninja.
We reviewed it on this podcast. I thought the

56
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:24,184
animation was really cool. And after reading
a lot about the monkey prince, you know, for

57
00:05:24,204 --> 00:05:29,506
our last episode, I'm absolutely convinced that
this character would make for a great animated

58
00:05:29,546 --> 00:05:35,968
feature. I think it makes more sense, like stylistically,
because the monkey prince looks cool as a character

59
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:41,978
and I think would adapt very well to a medium
with more visual movement. But I would say

60
00:05:42,018 --> 00:05:45,299
I wasn't too impressed with his origin story.
I think they would have to kind of tweak it

61
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:49,541
to make it more compelling for an animated film.
I think he has a great origin story. What are

62
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:55,043
you talking about? I mean, it was OK. I just
think it tied too much into his parents who

63
00:05:55,163 --> 00:05:59,785
are like super villain henchmen. I think you
could kind of like tone down that a little

64
00:05:59,805 --> 00:06:04,367
bit and then go more into his relationship with
the mythical Monkey King. I can see that. Yeah,

65
00:06:04,387 --> 00:06:08,489
that'd be cool. I do want to see the ultra human
eye as the villain, though, because I think

66
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:14,603
Monkey versus girl is just. The way to go. Just
yeah. Totally. Great answer CJ. Our next honorable

67
00:06:14,683 --> 00:06:19,704
mention goes to... Miggy Mattingian who said...
Hey what's up guys it's Miggy and I would love

68
00:06:19,744 --> 00:06:25,826
to see a Superman Smash the Clan animated movie.
I think it would be dope to see a Superman

69
00:06:25,846 --> 00:06:31,347
period piece kind of like Gotham by Gaslight.
And some like DC animated movies mimic the

70
00:06:31,507 --> 00:06:37,869
art style of the source material like All-Star
Superman or Superman Batman Apocalypse. And

71
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:42,283
I think it would be dope to do that here. And
now it's the perfect time with the popularity

72
00:06:42,323 --> 00:06:46,866
of the My Adventures with Superman animated
series. Yeah, so I haven't read the graphic

73
00:06:46,926 --> 00:06:52,349
novel, but I do know that it's inspired by the
Superman radio show that actually helped combat

74
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:58,113
the Klan's activities. That's a really cool
aspect of the character of Superman, and I

75
00:06:58,133 --> 00:07:03,336
would love for them to explore that in an animated
film. That would be really cool. The art style

76
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:08,598
on that comic book series looks really interesting
too. As Miggy said, if they choose to adapt

77
00:07:08,618 --> 00:07:13,160
that art style to the animated film as well,
I think it could add additional appeal. I also

78
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:18,842
like the idea of a time period piece for Superman.
Miggy's right, we've had several period pieces

79
00:07:18,942 --> 00:07:23,744
for Batman, but not for Superman, and I think
the character works very well in earlier time

80
00:07:23,784 --> 00:07:29,207
periods as well. Great answer, Miggy. Our final
honorable mention goes to Michael Harald, who

81
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:35,049
said, Hey guys. So I think the obvious answer
is going to be Black is Knight. That would

82
00:07:35,069 --> 00:07:41,135
be just... in every way and they couldn't just
do one movie for that either. They had to break

83
00:07:41,155 --> 00:07:48,156
it into multiple different ones. Like three
maybe a trilogy that'd be pretty freaking cool.

84
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:53,878
Yeah, Matt Lamb also gave this answer. I think
Blackest Night is one of the coolest DC storylines

85
00:07:54,178 --> 00:08:00,060
of all time. Just having all of its dead characters
come back as these evil zombies for the characters

86
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,621
to fight not only brought this like horror angle
to DC Comics but also like this tragic kind

87
00:08:06,701 --> 00:08:12,574
of personal stakes for the characters and that
they had to fight these people who they loved.

88
00:08:12,894 --> 00:08:20,459
Yeah, also, I think Green Lantern has a shocking
lack of animated projects under his belt, considering

89
00:08:20,519 --> 00:08:25,903
how cinematic his power set is. I think it would
be really great to get another Green Lantern

90
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:30,887
animated film out there beyond First Flight
and Emerald Nights. And Blackest Night is largely

91
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:35,663
regarded as one of Green Lantern's better stories.
Yeah, I mean, I would love it if they would

92
00:08:35,763 --> 00:08:41,088
lead up to it with the Sinestro Corps War and
then do Blackest Night. Obviously, the film

93
00:08:41,108 --> 00:08:44,891
would be centered around the Green Lanterns,
but I would also love to see them incorporate

94
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:50,816
the entire pantheon of DC Superman, Batman,
all of the characters. Matt Lamb suggested

95
00:08:50,976 --> 00:08:56,882
also incorporating Brightest Day into like a
two-part film series, but I could see Sinestro

96
00:08:56,902 --> 00:09:01,862
Corps War, then Blackest Night and Brightest
Day as like a trilogy. That'd be cool. We want

97
00:09:01,882 --> 00:09:05,805
to give a quick shout out to everyone who took
the time to visit our website and record an

98
00:09:05,925 --> 00:09:13,030
answer, including Brandon Estergard, Colby Henches,
Dustin Belcombe, John Storosky, Scott Camacho,

99
00:09:13,431 --> 00:09:18,194
and The Unworthy Collector, who you could find
on Instagram. But the winner of this week's

100
00:09:18,254 --> 00:09:23,798
No Prize goes to three different people who
gave the same answer. Ed Jones, Christopher

101
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,918
Menotti, and Noah Terry. Let's hear from Ed
Jones. What's up guys, it's Air Jones. I think

102
00:09:29,998 --> 00:09:34,340
one of the storylines that should be adapted
to Heaven Minion is Kingdom Come. It's probably

103
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:41,103
one of my favorite storylines in the DC universe.
It has the best of what DC has to offer. Present

104
00:09:41,143 --> 00:09:47,326
heroes, past heroes, and future possible heroes.
Great fight scenes, a great story, and it is

105
00:09:47,426 --> 00:09:53,169
the comic book that got me to love comic books.
So if it has to be one, it should definitely

106
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:59,820
be that. All right, thanks guys. Peace. Yeah,
Kingdom Come is my absolute favorite DC storyline

107
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,723
ever, which is surprising because it was also,
I think, the very first graphic novel from

108
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:11,487
DC that I had ever read. Similar to Ed Jones.
It's a fantastic story. I get more out of it

109
00:10:11,547 --> 00:10:16,430
every time I read it. I would love it if one
day they adapted it until live action, but

110
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:22,493
in the meantime, I would happily accept an animated
version of the movie. I'm actually having trouble.

111
00:10:22,818 --> 00:10:28,241
grasping how they have not yet adapted Kingdom
Come into an animated film considering all

112
00:10:28,281 --> 00:10:32,724
the different stories that DC has done. It's
the perfect Elseworlds story, and you know

113
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:37,608
James Gunn mentioned that they would be making
Elseworlds movies in his new DCU So I'm really

114
00:10:37,648 --> 00:10:42,371
hoping that this is one of them. He did post
a picture of the Kingdom Come like special

115
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:49,056
edition cover to his Twitter So I imagine he's
a fan and that gets me excited. It would be

116
00:10:49,076 --> 00:10:54,520
cool to see an animated Kingdom Come film done
in the art style of Alex Ross's paintings.

117
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,644
Yeah, yeah, that'd be really cool. Holy cow,
that'd be amazing. A painterly style would

118
00:10:59,665 --> 00:11:05,290
be perfection because the story itself is a
masterpiece. So congrats to Ed Jones, Christopher

119
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,854
Manotti, and Noah Terry, you all win this week's
No Prize. If you, the listener, want a shot

120
00:11:09,874 --> 00:11:13,657
at winning your own No Prize, stay tuned to
later on this episode when we'll be asking

121
00:11:13,817 --> 00:11:18,161
another Question of the Week. And now that that's
done, on to the news.

122
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:28,385
Alright this past week we learned from Sony
Pictures that the Craven the Hunter movie has

123
00:11:28,445 --> 00:11:36,030
moved from October 6th of this year to August
30th, 2024, almost a year back, largely due

124
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:42,454
to the ongoing actors and writers strikes. As
we all know, the current actor strikes prevent

125
00:11:42,554 --> 00:11:49,059
actors from promoting current or upcoming projects,
and so the speculation is that Sony moved the

126
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,254
Craven the Hunter movie in order to make sure
that Aaron Taylor Johnson was available. to

127
00:11:53,274 --> 00:11:57,577
do a worldwide press tour on the movie. My guess
is that they actually have little faith in

128
00:11:57,597 --> 00:12:02,941
the movie existing on its own without being
promoted by its lead star. Right, yeah, and

129
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:07,445
maybe if they feel like they need to tweak the
film after doing certain test screenings, this

130
00:12:07,465 --> 00:12:12,869
will give them opportunity to do so. Well, judging
off of the first teaser trailer that came out

131
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:18,294
for Cave in the Hunter, I would hope to God
they do a lot of tweaking because it does not

132
00:12:18,314 --> 00:12:24,843
look that great. Besides looking like the greatest
film ever right next to Morpheus. But we also

133
00:12:24,903 --> 00:12:29,446
received news that Spider-Man Beyond the Spider-Verse
has lost. It's an upcoming release date, which

134
00:12:29,466 --> 00:12:33,970
was supposed to be March 29th of next year.
And there was no way it was ever going to hit

135
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:38,533
that date anyway. So a delay was inevitable.
Yeah, the animators were saying that they haven't

136
00:12:38,854 --> 00:12:42,717
even begun work on the film. And, you know,
the across the Spider-Verse movie had to be

137
00:12:42,757 --> 00:12:46,980
delayed due to all the animation work they had
to do. I was really surprised to hear that

138
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,938
the movie has been delayed indefinitely, though.
I'm sure they'll get a release date if they

139
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:57,181
improve their relationship with animation studios,
who are apparently contentious with the studio

140
00:12:57,201 --> 00:13:01,483
right now, considering their strict deadlines
that they gave them. But also they can't get

141
00:13:01,523 --> 00:13:06,345
any voice performances done until the Actors
Union gets back to work. Right. Have you seen

142
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:10,607
Across the Spider-Verse yet? No, but I should
soon. I think the movie comes out on digital

143
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:15,329
in a few weeks here. I mean, so you probably
know that the film ends on a cliffhanger, like,

144
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:21,972
with no resolution? I don't want to know shit!
Shut the fuck up! I'm just saying like... I

145
00:13:22,273 --> 00:13:27,316
shut your mouth. If they don't make Beyond the
Spider-Verse, that's gonna really suck. I don't

146
00:13:27,336 --> 00:13:33,921
know. All right. I don't want to know anything.
Nobody talk to me. I will see the movie in

147
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:38,344
a few weeks and I'm actually looking forward
to listening to your review that you did on

148
00:13:38,704 --> 00:13:43,908
it. UN Spees. For those who don't know my daughter
was born right around the release of Across

149
00:13:43,928 --> 00:13:48,398
the Spider-Verse. So I was not able to go see
it in theaters. But also in Sony Spidey news,

150
00:13:48,418 --> 00:13:54,300
we got a release date for Venom 3, which is
going to come out on July 12th, 2024. And I

151
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,741
know that they've started filming already, so
I guess they had to stop production. Yeah,

152
00:13:58,761 --> 00:14:04,103
they had some set photos from the sets for Venom
3. We know that the last film Venom Let There

153
00:14:04,123 --> 00:14:10,245
Be Carnage ended with Venom in Mexico kind of
taking a vacation. And it looks like he will

154
00:14:10,285 --> 00:14:14,195
continue his adventures down there for at least
part of this film. But yeah, all the news this

155
00:14:14,235 --> 00:14:19,765
past week was in regards to Sony's Spider-Man
universe, which brings us to our question of

156
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:20,125
the week.

157
00:14:24,718 --> 00:14:31,081
Who's your favorite Spider-Man or woman across
the comics multiverse and why? Yeah, so we're

158
00:14:31,101 --> 00:14:35,743
not looking for your favorite actor who's played

That does it for all the news for this episode,
so let's go ahead and move on to the main event

166
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:16,833
where we review Disney Plus' latest Marvel Studios
series, Secret Invasion.

167
00:15:32,106 --> 00:15:38,351
Alright, Secret Invasion is the latest Marvel
Studio series on Disney+, showrun by Kyle Bradstreet,

168
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:45,316
directed by Ali Saleem, and starring Samuel
L. Jackson. The show is about the Skrull alien

169
00:15:45,356 --> 00:15:50,340
invasion of Earth. Skrulls being shapeshifting
beings that can take the form of anyone. We

170
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,004
first saw them in the MCU in the Captain Marvel
film, which was kind of a prerequisite for

171
00:15:55,024 --> 00:16:00,469
this series. Secret Invasion has quite a few
surprises throughout, so right up top, here's

172
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:05,908
your We'll be revealing all the show surprises.
So if you haven't watched Secret Invasion yet,

173
00:16:06,168 --> 00:16:11,071
be sure to turn off the podcast, go watch it,
then come back and listen to our review. Because

174
00:16:11,131 --> 00:16:16,275
I think ultimately it's worth seeing, especially
if you're a Marvel fan. I definitely think

175
00:16:16,315 --> 00:16:20,978
it's the most interesting thing that Marvel
has put out in a while, at least on Disney

176
00:16:21,018 --> 00:16:27,946
Plus. And at least with something that has connective
tissue to the larger MCU. Yeah, it was pretty

177
00:16:27,966 --> 00:16:33,530
interesting and I remember being super excited
for Secret Invasion before it came out because

178
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:37,733
I thought the comic book series was pretty fun.
You know, trying to guess which of Earth's

179
00:16:37,773 --> 00:16:41,756
heroes were going to turn out to be a Skrull,
how long they had been taken over and stuff

180
00:16:41,776 --> 00:16:48,041
like that. I really enjoy paranoid thrillers
that deal with not knowing who to trust. Like

181
00:16:48,081 --> 00:16:52,524
those types of thrillers take a special sort
of like writing prowess, I think, to steer

182
00:16:52,584 --> 00:16:56,831
audiences in different directions. constantly
making people second-guess things and question

183
00:16:56,851 --> 00:17:01,554
their previous assumptions. Especially since,
usually, audiences are primed not to trust

184
00:17:01,634 --> 00:17:06,176
anything when it comes to this sort of genre.
So, like, when it's done well, it's like a

185
00:17:06,216 --> 00:17:12,019
work of art. Films like John Carpenter's The
Thing come to mind, and I thought the marketing

186
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:18,083
did a great job of getting me to expect something
like that. Which is kind of a shame because

187
00:17:18,403 --> 00:17:22,865
the show ended up going in a different direction.
Like, there were surprises to be had for sure.

188
00:17:23,278 --> 00:17:29,102
And in fact, there were moments almost every
episode where I was like, oh damn! But like,

189
00:17:29,303 --> 00:17:35,948
surprises I don't think are the same thing as
twists. Surprises I define as unexpected events

190
00:17:36,128 --> 00:17:42,533
in the course of a story. Twists are unexpected
events that alter your previously held assumptions.

191
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:47,958
The latter of which I think are sorely lacking
in the story, whose source material is rife

192
00:17:47,998 --> 00:17:52,746
with twists. It's a shame because Marvel television
has done this sort of story before. And it

193
00:17:52,766 --> 00:17:57,867
was fucking incredible. On the Agents of SHIELD
television show, and those who watched it will

194
00:17:57,907 --> 00:18:02,948
know, in the middle of season four, there was
an arc about a rogue AI who had replaced several

195
00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:07,049
members of the team with life model decoys,
which are androids meant to serve as copies

196
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:11,891
of people. Like Nick Fury uses them a lot in
the comics. But anyway, in Agents of SHIELD,

197
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:17,012
there was an episode called Self Control where
two scientist characters, Fitz and Simmons,

198
00:18:17,112 --> 00:18:21,513
who love each other, they learn that some members
of the team are secretly LMDs, but they don't

199
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:25,414
know what to do. and it really toyed with your
emotions, making you go back and forth on these

200
00:18:25,434 --> 00:18:30,176
characters. It was flawless. And that whole
episode was great, probably actually the best

201
00:18:30,396 --> 00:18:34,877
single episode of the entire Agents of the Shield
series. And I feel like that should have been

202
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:40,639
the template for what this Secret Invasion show
should have been like. Okay, yeah, I get how,

203
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:45,920
you know, you would want this to be like that.
I think on its own, just judging it though,

204
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,102
it was good. It was solid. I was surprised at
how much I didn't hate it, honestly. because

205
00:18:51,122 --> 00:18:56,147
of all the vitriol I see online regarding the
show. And a lot of it honestly has to do with

206
00:18:56,227 --> 00:19:01,873
comparisons to the comic and how little of the
MCU universe it was able to utilize. Right.

207
00:19:01,893 --> 00:19:07,498
There was no cameos really in this outside of
Rhodey. Yeah, I would totally agree with that

208
00:19:07,518 --> 00:19:12,744
criticism and I'll touch on that. My main problem
with Secret Invasion is that we were constantly

209
00:19:12,804 --> 00:19:17,543
given the villains perspective, like. We knew
Gravik's plans, we knew almost every facet

210
00:19:17,563 --> 00:19:22,025
of what he was trying to do and how he was trying
to do it. There was no mystery there, and because

211
00:19:22,045 --> 00:19:28,567
there was no mystery, there was no paranoia
and very few twists. That's a fantastic point

212
00:19:28,587 --> 00:19:32,589
that I didn't even think about actually. And
yeah, that's totally true. It's like what if

213
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:38,491
in the X-Files, like you knew what the Cigarette
Man was all about and like what his plans were.

214
00:19:38,932 --> 00:19:44,126
It would just completely strip the show of all
of its mystery. For sure, for sure. I think

215
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:48,610
the show should have focused more on Fury as
he's uncovering everything and should have

216
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:53,314
totally kept the whole Skrull thing as a mystery.
And maybe it was just false expectations on

217
00:19:53,354 --> 00:19:58,278
my part, but I think the marketing really steered
me toward expecting a paranoid thriller. So

218
00:19:58,578 --> 00:20:02,662
the show never really ended up being what I
thought it should have been. Despite that,

219
00:20:02,942 --> 00:20:08,971
I will commend Secret Invasion for its tone
and performances. which both really elevated

220
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:13,836
the feel of everything, I think similar to Captain
America the Winter Soldier, which was comparatively

221
00:20:14,337 --> 00:20:19,422
much more mature than other Marvel Studios fare.
Like looking at this series next to something

222
00:20:19,462 --> 00:20:24,427
like Amon and the Wasp quantumania, it's like
watching the evening news compared to Saturday

223
00:20:24,467 --> 00:20:30,253
morning cartoon. And while both are good, I
find myself more intrigued by the more mature

224
00:20:30,293 --> 00:20:35,483
stuff personally. This was definitely more mature
than anything Marvel has done in a while. Definitely

225
00:20:35,523 --> 00:20:40,624
more violent, surprisingly so for a Disney plus
show. Absolutely. I'm thinking to like when

226
00:20:40,644 --> 00:20:46,106
that guy got his finger cut off. Yeah. During
the torture scene, that was intense. I mean,

227
00:20:46,186 --> 00:20:50,947
he ended up being an alien, so it was like purple
blood. But still, for sure. Or when like you

228
00:20:50,987 --> 00:20:55,768
see Gravit getting shot in the face, even though
he heals with the extremist powers, it was

229
00:20:55,788 --> 00:21:00,358
still pretty crazy. There were definitely a
lot of things to like within this series. But

230
00:21:00,398 --> 00:21:06,999
for every great performance or mature scene
or violent action that there was, I also feel

231
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:12,221
like there was a larger plot hole within the
series. There were so many questions that are

232
00:21:12,301 --> 00:21:18,082
posed by the very conceit of this show as it's
presented here. So what I'd like to do is similar

233
00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:22,544
to what we did with Loki Season 1 where I had
a lot of questions. I'm going to run through

234
00:21:22,604 --> 00:21:26,365
all the plot holes I thought of while watching
the series and you and I will see if we can

235
00:21:26,405 --> 00:21:32,006
fill in some of these gaps ourselves. Sure.
Alright. Plot hole question number one. I understand

236
00:21:32,066 --> 00:21:37,188
why Fury wouldn't want to get the Avengers involved
because it could possibly reveal the existence

237
00:21:37,228 --> 00:21:42,089
of the Harvest sample, and exposing the Skrulls
to the world at large puts both the Skrulls

238
00:21:42,349 --> 00:21:47,190
and humanity at risk. But why wouldn't Fury
just reveal the Skrull invasion to the World

239
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:52,032
Security Council? Because even if a few of their
members were Skrulls, that would at least be

240
00:21:52,072 --> 00:21:57,173
a covert way to draw suspicion among them to
any sort of global manipulation Gravik's army

241
00:21:57,193 --> 00:22:01,250
would try to achieve. Like he could have said
something along the lines of, scrolls are a

242
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:06,132
mongus, hold off any World War III shit at least
for the time being until this is sorted out.

243
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:11,593
That's not a plot hole. He figured he could
avert the global catastrophe on his own without

244
00:22:11,633 --> 00:22:17,395
needing help from anyone because he's motherfucking
Nick Fury. Well, that's just foolish. I think

245
00:22:17,495 --> 00:22:22,076
the Secret Invasion series needed like more
superheroes in it. Having more powerful beings

246
00:22:22,516 --> 00:22:27,517
as scroll wild cards makes it more risky to
do anything and it would handcuff Fury's actions

247
00:22:27,577 --> 00:22:32,541
more. And I mean, like you had the Super Scroll
element here, sure. But because Fury held all

248
00:22:32,581 --> 00:22:36,684
the cards there with the harvest sample, he
definitely had more options with what he could

249
00:22:36,765 --> 00:22:42,189
do here than if he was dealing with like Scroll
Iron Man or Scroll Scarlet Witch. You know,

250
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:47,353
I think he should have done some sort of revelation
to a select number of people that could actually

251
00:22:47,553 --> 00:22:51,997
prevent World War Three from happening if it
came down to that. Well, I mean, I don't think

252
00:22:52,017 --> 00:22:57,041
you necessarily needed super powered characters.
I think the scrolls could have easily, you

253
00:22:57,061 --> 00:23:02,301
know, hijacked one of Tony Stark's old Iron
Man suits. There are definitely heroes without

254
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:08,045
superpowers tied to their DNA that could have
been involved here, like Falcon, Winter Soldier,

255
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:13,228
the whole cast of characters from the Thunderbolts
pretty much. Yeah, I mean, that's actually

256
00:23:13,489 --> 00:23:17,992
true. It's easier for Skrulls to replicate those
sort of abilities than it is to replicate the

257
00:23:18,072 --> 00:23:22,435
ones that they needed the Harvest DNA for. Speaking
of those type of heroes, that brings me to

258
00:23:22,475 --> 00:23:28,346
my next plothole question. Why wouldn't Skrull
roadie? just assumed the role of president.

259
00:23:28,766 --> 00:23:33,528
He and the other Skrulls spent so long trying
to manipulate the world into chaos when they

260
00:23:33,548 --> 00:23:37,050
could have just been more selective in whose
identities they assumed and then just took

261
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:42,212
over. Like if I were Skrull Rodie, I would have
put President Ritzen into a permanent nap time

262
00:23:42,232 --> 00:23:46,954
with a hospital pillow and then just assumed
his form and ordered the nuclear attack. Like

263
00:23:46,974 --> 00:23:52,376
it doesn't get more simple than that. The Skrulls
themselves seemed severely handicapped in their

264
00:23:52,396 --> 00:23:57,306
ability to shape shift and assume just anyone
at any time. Right, they needed to get people

265
00:23:57,546 --> 00:24:02,247
whose memories they were able to capture. And
I think that's largely the main reason why

266
00:24:02,287 --> 00:24:08,049
they didn't assume President Ritzen's form because
they didn't have access to his knowledge and

267
00:24:08,249 --> 00:24:12,310
maybe they felt like they needed it. Okay, so
I put him in a temporary coma, put him in a

268
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:17,212
closet, order the strike, then take him out
of the closet. I mean, it's simple stuff here.

269
00:24:17,592 --> 00:24:22,913
That's fair. That brings me to pahol question
number three. Aliens already live on Earth

270
00:24:23,073 --> 00:24:28,299
in the MCU. They have a whole ass settlement
called New Asgard, which seems to be widely

271
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:33,260
accepted by Earthlings. So why do Fury and Talos
believe that humans will not accept the Skrulls?

272
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:42,263
Because Thor, Love and Thunder is stupid. I
actually like what Secret Invasion does here.

273
00:24:42,303 --> 00:24:47,964
I'd rather erase the other bad Thor stuff and
leave Secret Invasion the way it is. Okay,

274
00:24:48,004 --> 00:24:53,226
well then that being said, you know, there's
only a million alleged Skrulls on Earth. That's

275
00:24:53,306 --> 00:24:58,309
only like a city's worth. And there's so much
unoccupied land throughout the globe. The scroll

276
00:24:58,329 --> 00:25:02,212
should have been simple to accommodate, right?
Like why can't the UN establish a scroll city

277
00:25:02,352 --> 00:25:07,516
on Antarctica? Like, if you even said the scrolls
like the cold, right? And that's a whole ass

278
00:25:07,536 --> 00:25:11,519
continent to themselves to live on in their
own skin. They could even keep the city secret

279
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,421
if they wanted. Cause like, ain't nobody going
down there. Like fucking call them Santa's

280
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:20,585
green elves or some shit. I don't care. I feel
like the show made this problem much more complicated

281
00:25:20,605 --> 00:25:26,137
than it needed to be. I think just by him saying
that they like the cold makes this a plot hole.

282
00:25:26,417 --> 00:25:29,119
Because you're right, they could have gone to
Antarctica. He should have said they hate the

283
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:35,363
cold. There you go. Exactly. And maybe that's
why they hated being in Russia. Maybe. But

284
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:40,987
that just made me think of something like, why
didn't the Skrulls just make their own home

285
00:25:41,127 --> 00:25:45,950
in Russia? I guess they kind of did, you could
argue with their settlement. But if they're

286
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:51,486
so concerned about having a home of their own
skin, that's literally it. They knew humans

287
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:55,209
weren't around. Yeah, all they needed to do
was establish their perimeter. It would have

288
00:25:55,229 --> 00:25:59,093
been undetectable to most humans, and it largely
was throughout the course of the show. Like

289
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:03,497
Russia, I don't think knew what was going on
there. So weird. But that brings me to plot

290
00:26:03,517 --> 00:26:08,021
hole question number four. The Guardians of
the Galaxy and Thor films have shown that it's

291
00:26:08,061 --> 00:26:14,246
a large universe out there with plenty of inhabitable
planets. How is it possible that Captain Marvel

292
00:26:14,266 --> 00:26:20,238
and Nick Fury cannot find even one to establish
as new Skrullos? I don't fucking know. Like

293
00:26:20,258 --> 00:26:25,261
they didn't show that. But also, like, why was
it up to just those two? Like the Avengers

294
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:30,984
have their own ships, their Quinjets that can
go off world as we saw happen to Hulk in Thor

295
00:26:31,004 --> 00:26:36,347
Ragnarok. You know, at the very least, Saber
could make the scrolls some ships and the scrolls

296
00:26:36,407 --> 00:26:40,530
even had their own starship at the end of Captain
Marvel. So why couldn't the scrolls use that

297
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:44,732
to find their own planet? They tried. All of
Asgard was living on one spaceship at the end

298
00:26:44,772 --> 00:26:49,698
of Ragnarok. I'm sure the scrolls can do that,
too. Better yet, fucking Gaia has literally

299
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:54,900
all the powers now. Why can't she fly her ass
into space to find a new world? She probably

300
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:59,202
couldn't, she probably will. They didn't address
that here though. Your mom didn't address that

301
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:03,324
here though. I wanna know why they couldn't
find a new planet. It doesn't make sense. But

302
00:27:03,384 --> 00:27:08,806
how many habitable planets are there that are
like Earth? So many as we've seen in Guardians

303
00:27:08,846 --> 00:27:13,108
of the Galaxy and Thor. Yeah, but they're all
taken too. Those can't be the only ones though.

304
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:18,306
I understand that they couldn't find it, I just
think that's preposterous. Honestly, I don't

305
00:27:18,366 --> 00:27:22,088
like sounding like I'm nagging, but like it
doesn't take a brilliant mind to think of these

306
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:26,449
things. And I wish the writers would have addressed
at least some of these plot holes to keep audiences

307
00:27:26,469 --> 00:27:31,571
from asking these nagging questions that rob
some of the enjoyment from the story. I feel

308
00:27:31,631 --> 00:27:36,453
personally, you know, every story is going to
have plot holes for the most part. Anyone could

309
00:27:36,553 --> 00:27:41,616
ask any question and just get offended that
they don't have an answer. Half of these questions

310
00:27:41,636 --> 00:27:47,314
didn't cross my mind as I was watching this.
I enjoyed it, but I guess I would. say that

311
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:54,100
for a show of this type, that should be something
of a mystery, you want as little of those plothole

312
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,225
questions as possible. Grievances aside, I do
think that one of the best things about the

313
00:27:59,245 --> 00:28:03,749
show is the performances and the caliber of
the cast involved. So let's go ahead and talk

314
00:28:03,769 --> 00:28:10,335
about the actors in our character breakdown.
Starting with Nick Fury. Motherfucking what?

315
00:28:10,535 --> 00:28:14,574
Nothing. I was gonna try and get that in before
he said Nick Fury. Starting with motherfucking

316
00:28:14,655 --> 00:28:20,520
Nick Fury played by Samuel L. Jackson and we
know the L stands for motherfucking Samuel

317
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:27,546
L. Jackson I think really shined in parts in
this show and I adore the actor without a doubt

318
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:33,812
He is a legend but I don't know if it's the
actor or the character He came across as really

319
00:28:33,932 --> 00:28:39,356
weary here Which was kind of hard to watch whether
it's seeing Fury past his prime or maybe Sam

320
00:28:39,397 --> 00:28:44,135
Jackson just aging I didn't mind that. I think
it made sense and I think that he came up with

321
00:28:44,175 --> 00:28:50,016
a lot of reasons for why that was the case.
You know, he was blipped and that really shook

322
00:28:50,056 --> 00:28:54,918
him as a character. I do appreciate the show
delving deeper into his past, you know, with

323
00:28:54,958 --> 00:29:00,480
his wife, who is a scroll and revealing that
he rose to prominence within Shield only by

324
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:06,341
exploiting the scrolls. That was fascinating.
Yeah, it helped cement his deceitful nature,

325
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:10,287
which. You know, you ultimately forgive because
you always know Fury's intentions are always

326
00:29:10,307 --> 00:29:15,290
about protecting the innocent. But that's the
thing I love most about the character, even

327
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:20,373
from the comics. You know, Nick Fury has always
been the most unethical, yet paradoxically

328
00:29:20,553 --> 00:29:24,776
most moral man. You know, the man who always
does whatever it takes for the greater good,

329
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:30,439
no matter how dishonest the action. Like personally,
I would never trust Nick Fury with anything

330
00:29:30,879 --> 00:29:35,294
except to get the job done. I loved the scenes
with Sam Jackson. especially when he was just

331
00:29:35,314 --> 00:29:40,937
like talking with other people. I could watch
Sam Jackson talk for hours, literally. I literally

332
00:29:40,977 --> 00:29:47,221
did, I guess. His delivery as an actor is second
to none. Oh yeah, absolutely. Going toe to

333
00:29:47,261 --> 00:29:52,003
toe with like Don Cheadle or the actress from
The Queen, I forget her name. Olivia Colman.

334
00:29:52,203 --> 00:29:57,486
Literally everyone on the show he had a conversation
with. Top notch work. In the season, Nick Fury's

335
00:29:57,566 --> 00:30:02,509
arc revolved around guilt. You know, he couldn't
find the scrolls of home. He put the world

336
00:30:02,629 --> 00:30:07,667
above his wife. He knows that the conflict and
Gravik's motivations are all his fault. I think

337
00:30:07,687 --> 00:30:12,448
the show did a good job of showing that his
actions do weigh on him, despite the fact he

338
00:30:12,468 --> 00:30:16,209
would never apologize for them. I really got
the sense that, you know, his heart may be

339
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:21,811
cold, but it still beats. And by the end, you
know, Gravik is stopped. And he goes back to

340
00:30:21,871 --> 00:30:26,412
remedying his other guilt, this time choosing
to involve his wife as he tries to get peace

341
00:30:26,432 --> 00:30:30,573
through other means. So Fury here was really
trying to work on alleviating his conscience

342
00:30:30,773 --> 00:30:35,883
from his past actions. Right. But that brings
us to the villain Gravik who is played by Kingsley

343
00:30:35,923 --> 00:30:41,305
Benadir. This is my first real exposure to the
actor. I think he did fine here portraying

344
00:30:41,365 --> 00:30:46,647
the arrogance of Gravik. It was easy to understand
his motivations as the character. However,

345
00:30:46,787 --> 00:30:50,909
it was all kind of fairly generic. Maybe it
was an issue of screen time, perhaps a lack

346
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:57,471
of charisma. But outside of an early flashback
and Gravik's angry rant at Fury in the last

347
00:30:57,511 --> 00:31:02,758
episode, I feel like we barely got to know Gravik.
He was mostly just like a smiling face. who

348
00:31:02,798 --> 00:31:06,301
probably could have been played by anybody.
But that being said, I don't think he's the

349
00:31:06,341 --> 00:31:11,745
worst Disney plus MCU villain. I think that
honor still goes to She-Hulk or Flag Smasher

350
00:31:11,785 --> 00:31:16,069
from Falcon and the Winter Soldier. He was a
villain that definitely grew on me throughout

351
00:31:16,089 --> 00:31:20,953
the series. I didn't really care for him in
the earlier episodes, especially the way he

352
00:31:20,993 --> 00:31:25,677
always kept his mouth open. I was like, close
it, mouth breather. What? I didn't even notice

353
00:31:25,897 --> 00:31:29,640
that. Yeah, just the actor's performance. I
think he always had like a smirk on his face,

354
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:34,564
so his mouth was always open. But later on,
I thought his plan was interesting, honestly.

355
00:31:34,944 --> 00:31:39,787
It really transitioned from being about finding
the Skrulls a new home to the more selfish

356
00:31:39,847 --> 00:31:44,291
ambition of gaining power for himself. And I
think the Skrulls recognized it and that's

357
00:31:44,331 --> 00:31:48,714
why they tried to form that mutiny. Yeah, that
was a crazy scene. Let's go ahead and move

358
00:31:48,754 --> 00:31:54,798
on to Talos, played by Ben Mendelsohn. I adore
Ben Mendelsohn. The more I see of him, the

359
00:31:54,838 --> 00:31:59,261
more of a fan I am. I think he's a fantastic
actor. I think he gave a really personable

360
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:04,451
performance here. even though you kind of come
to realize how flawed and kind of lazy and

361
00:32:04,511 --> 00:32:10,234
meek his perspective is. You know, over the
years you see that he came to rely on Fury

362
00:32:10,274 --> 00:32:16,076
too much and saw that living on Earth and hiding
as being the best solution for his people,

363
00:32:16,396 --> 00:32:19,918
even though I think he should have realized
that eventually the Skrulls would want more

364
00:32:19,958 --> 00:32:27,241
for themselves. Despite his flaws, I was shocked
when he died and that hit me because I know

365
00:32:27,261 --> 00:32:32,612
that I'll miss Ben Mendelsohn in the MCU. Yeah,
he had a really interesting relationship with

366
00:32:32,672 --> 00:32:38,458
Nick Fury, and they had some great back-and-forth
scenes with each other. Ben Middleson's performance,

367
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:43,984
he's just a phenomenal actor, and I agree, I
will also miss the character of Talos. I don't

368
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:50,711
know if I would describe him as lazy. I think
he was optimistic. He's kind of like the Professor

369
00:32:50,912 --> 00:32:57,749
X to Gravix Magneto. He just foresaw a world
where one day, Skrulls and humans potentially

370
00:32:57,789 --> 00:33:02,032
could live together. I think he kind of gave
up hope that they would ever find a new world

371
00:33:02,052 --> 00:33:06,315
because he went out searching with Carol Danvers
and couldn't find anything, you know. That's

372
00:33:06,335 --> 00:33:11,678
true, that's a fantastic analogy. You're totally
right. I think you could also compare Talos

373
00:33:11,718 --> 00:33:16,862
to like Moses. And you know, he was just trying
to deliver his people to the promised land,

374
00:33:17,242 --> 00:33:22,085
but they were so impatient and inconsiderate
that they were never gonna get where they wanted

375
00:33:22,105 --> 00:33:26,637
to go. And I think he was kind of partly just
upset with his own people because of that.

376
00:33:26,997 --> 00:33:30,761
You're just crushing it with the comparisons
today. Yeah, I'm pretty popular at parties.

377
00:33:33,043 --> 00:33:39,569
I can compare anything to anything. Let's go
ahead and move on to Gaia, who is played by

378
00:33:39,649 --> 00:33:44,193
Emilia Clarke. Emilia kind of gave somewhat
of a detached performance here, but I think

379
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:48,336
had maybe to do with the character's misgivings
because she neither really identified with

380
00:33:48,356 --> 00:33:53,604
her father or Gravik. I'm really interested
in seeing where Gaia goes from here, especially

381
00:33:53,944 --> 00:33:58,768
as the most fucking overpowered being in the
entire universe now. For real, like I thought

382
00:33:58,808 --> 00:34:04,532
Carol Danvers was overpowered to the way she
just like tanked Thanos' punch. What the fuck

383
00:34:04,552 --> 00:34:09,916
would Gaia do? Like she could literally do anything
she wants now. Pretty much like she has Captain

384
00:34:09,956 --> 00:34:16,059
Marvel's powers, Thanos' thors. all the black
order is just nuts. Like you think she'd really

385
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,341
be able to take some agency now with her desires
for her people and get them a new place to

386
00:34:20,401 --> 00:34:25,843
live. Like if she can't do it, literally no
one else can. Literally. I mean, she could

387
00:34:25,883 --> 00:34:30,285
rule the whole planet for all she wants right
now. Like what's stopping her? Absolutely nothing

388
00:34:30,325 --> 00:34:34,667
and nothing can. Well, probably the goodness
of her heart. But otherwise, yeah, I mean,

389
00:34:34,707 --> 00:34:39,289
it's hard to complain too much because I also
do think that storyline was brilliant with

390
00:34:39,309 --> 00:34:45,489
the DNA and the power absorption. since scrolls
by their nature, you know, have shape shifting

391
00:34:45,529 --> 00:34:49,432
DNA, it kind of makes sense that they would
be able to absorb other people's powers. And

392
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:54,877
I thought that, you know, in lieu of the Fantastic
Four existing in this universe, that being

393
00:34:54,937 --> 00:34:59,882
able to take Korg's arm instead of the thing,
or like Groot's stretchy powers instead of

394
00:34:59,902 --> 00:35:05,227
Mr. Fantastic, or Carol Denver's like light
aura instead of human torch was pretty smart.

395
00:35:05,527 --> 00:35:10,446
It was really smart. I liked that. You know,
the first... Original Super Skrull in the comics

396
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:14,949
was a villain for the Fantastic Four and his
name was Colert and we did a dual episode with

397
00:35:14,969 --> 00:35:19,371
him that you can check out where he fought against
Metamorpho. But the Skrulls gave him the powers

398
00:35:19,531 --> 00:35:24,994
of the Human Torch, Mr. Fantastic, Invisible
Woman, and The Thing. And in the show, the

399
00:35:25,034 --> 00:35:31,038
powers that Gravik was initially able to obtain
corresponded to the Human Torches with the

400
00:35:31,078 --> 00:35:37,501
Extremis abilities, Mr. Fantastic's with Groot's
powers, and The Things largely through Cull

401
00:35:37,521 --> 00:35:42,564
Obsidian's powers. They were missing the invisibility
aspect, but they kind of did get that later

402
00:35:42,624 --> 00:35:48,047
through ghosts abilities, you know? And in the
comics, there have been other Super Scrolls

403
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:54,170
that have had other combinations of Marvel hero
powers, especially used within the Secret Invasion

404
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:58,613
storyline. Like there was one that had Black
Panthers and Quicksilvers and Visions powers,

405
00:35:58,653 --> 00:36:03,495
like that was one Super Scroll. There was another
one that had a bunch of X-Men powers like Colossus,

406
00:36:03,836 --> 00:36:08,674
Nightcrawler, Cyclops and Wolverine. So the
fact that they kind of... took that concept

407
00:36:08,914 --> 00:36:12,635
and applied it here with all the Avengers and
stuff. I actually, I really liked that. And

408
00:36:12,655 --> 00:36:17,136
how they were portrayed visually, like that
kind of like patchwork sort of body style,

409
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:22,158
I just had a great time with. Yeah, that was
cool. Let's go ahead and move on to Reva, who

410
00:36:22,218 --> 00:36:28,299
is a Skrull disguised as James Rhodes played
by Don Cheadle. I love Don Cheadle as Rhodey.

411
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:33,241
I thought he did a fantastic job of playing
the villain. You could definitely tell the

412
00:36:33,261 --> 00:36:38,858
difference between Skrull Rhodey and regular
Although maybe you can't because what this

413
00:36:39,078 --> 00:36:44,780
show seems to insinuate is that Rhodey was switched
during the events of Captain America Civil

414
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:50,621
War when he was knocked out of the sky accidentally
by vision and taken to the hospital. Right.

415
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:55,363
Because we see him being taken away without
being able to use his legs, wearing a hospital

416
00:36:55,383 --> 00:37:00,704
gown in episode six of the show, which is pretty
crazy. And that means that anytime we've seen

417
00:37:00,724 --> 00:37:06,138
him since then, it's been a scroll, including
Falcon in the Winter Soldier. Infinity War

418
00:37:06,398 --> 00:37:11,523
and Endgame. Pretty crazy. I'm really excited
to see what happens to Rhodey's character in

419
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:16,467
the upcoming Armor Wars movie and how he kind
of like redeems his whole situation. Let's

420
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:21,190
go ahead and move on to Sonya Falsworth who
was played by Olivia Colman. She stole every

421
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:26,074
scene that she was in. She was a true standout
in the show. I loved every single second when

422
00:37:26,094 --> 00:37:30,386
she was on the screen. It was just a lot of
fun. Is she a character from the comics? Like,

423
00:37:30,506 --> 00:37:34,608
I wasn't quite sure why she was in the show.
I thought she was gonna be a Skrull in all

424
00:37:34,648 --> 00:37:40,031
honesty. So did I, actually. She's not from
the comics, she's an original character. But

425
00:37:40,351 --> 00:37:46,434
her last name is Fallsworth, which is the same
last name as James Fallsworth, who's a British

426
00:37:46,494 --> 00:37:51,657
hero named Union Jack in the comics. And actually,
that character was one of the Howling Commandos

427
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:56,300
in the Captain America, the first adventure
movie. He was the British one. Huh, I wonder

428
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,474
if they'll go down that route where like her
son becomes Union Jack. Maybe I don't know.

429
00:38:00,514 --> 00:38:06,376
My assumption is that Sonya Fallsworth is the
daughter of James Fallsworth, the Howling Commando.

430
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:12,359
Okay. Because in the comics, if I remember correctly,
he did have a daughter who was a superhero.

431
00:38:12,399 --> 00:38:18,301
Her name was Spitfire. And obviously here Sonya
Fallsworth is just a brilliant MI6 agent. But

432
00:38:18,722 --> 00:38:23,944
I think her character is kind of in homage to
that. She definitely was a Spitfire. Yeah,

433
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:29,294
for sure. Let's go to move on to the final character
I want to talk about. Vara, who's played by

434
00:38:29,334 --> 00:38:34,876
Charlene Woodard. I don't have much to say about
her other than I think she gave a superb performance.

435
00:38:35,036 --> 00:38:39,538
I did want to point out that she played Sam
Jackson's mom in Unbreakable and that really

436
00:38:39,558 --> 00:38:45,041
threw me off every time they had a scene together.
I also noticed that and I was like, what? It

437
00:38:45,061 --> 00:38:50,483
was a little awkward, I felt like. I still haven't
seen Glass yet, which is like the third movie

438
00:38:50,683 --> 00:38:55,145
in that franchise because it goes Unbreakable,
then Split, then Glass. So I'm interested in

439
00:38:55,205 --> 00:38:59,750
seeing how, you know, those actors. kind of
play off each other as mother and son again

440
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:03,435
in that movie. I don't know. I haven't seen
it either. That's the reason for me to not

441
00:39:03,475 --> 00:39:04,116
want to see that.

442
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:17,294
Let's go ahead and move into our episode highlights.
Episode 1 was called Resurrection. In Russia,

443
00:39:17,555 --> 00:39:23,100
CIA operative Evert K. Ross meets with paranoid
agent Prescott, who tells him that the shapeshifting

444
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:28,245
alien Skrulls have secretly begun infiltrating
Earth posing as humans. Killing Prescott in

445
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:33,329
self-defense, Ross flees a pursuing Russian
agent and falls off a building and dies, which

446
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:39,038
reveals him to be a Skrull. The pursuing Russian
is revealed to be Talos. a former leader of

447
00:39:39,078 --> 00:39:44,261
a group of Skrulls who first came to Earth decades
ago as refugees from the Kree-Skrull War. Nick

448
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:48,803
Fury is summoned from the space station Sabre
to address the Skrull threat, learning from

449
00:39:48,864 --> 00:39:54,407
Talos and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Maria Hill that
a group of rebel Skrulls led by Gravik intend

450
00:39:54,427 --> 00:39:59,529
to clandestinely start a nuclear war that will
annihilate human life on Earth, leaving it

451
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:05,853
as a new home for the radiation-resistant Skrulls.
Fury meets with his former ally, MI6 agent

452
00:40:05,893 --> 00:40:10,816
Sonya Falsworth. who is also investigating the
Skrull threat and tracked a stolen dirty bomb

453
00:40:10,896 --> 00:40:16,739
to Moscow. While following the bomb, Talos reunites
with his estranged daughter Gaia, who has joined

454
00:40:16,759 --> 00:40:21,462
the Skrull rebellion but becomes a double agent
after learning the rebels killed her mother.

455
00:40:21,882 --> 00:40:26,805
She reveals to Talos Gravik's plan to bomb a
square in Moscow and portray it as an American

456
00:40:26,845 --> 00:40:33,448
attack. Fury, Talos, and Hill fail to stop Gravik's
bomb and in the chaos, Gravik disguises himself

457
00:40:33,488 --> 00:40:38,483
as Fury and shoots Maria Hill. I thought this
was a really solid first episode. This was

458
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:43,286
a lot of what I was actually expecting from
the show. It had a lot of great intrigue, spy

459
00:40:43,326 --> 00:40:49,609
dialogue, and lots of shocks and twists. Yeah,
I saw Maria Hill's death coming though. It

460
00:40:49,629 --> 00:40:53,472
was foreshadowed heavily during the chess scene
that she gave with Fury, where she was like,

461
00:40:53,872 --> 00:40:59,195
you're off your game Fury, and when you are,
people get hurt. I was like, okay, she's dead.

462
00:40:59,275 --> 00:41:04,458
Exactly, exactly. But I agree, it was a solid
opening episode for sure. Go ahead and move

463
00:41:04,518 --> 00:41:09,442
on to episode 2, which was called Promises.
In the late 90s, we see Fury recruiting the

464
00:41:09,462 --> 00:41:14,726
Skrull refugees, including a young Gravik as
his covert operatives in protecting Earth in

465
00:41:14,787 --> 00:41:20,491
exchange for finding them a new home planet.
In the present, en route to London, Talos reveals

466
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:25,796
to Fury that he summoned even more refugees
in that time, and that around 1 million Skrulls

467
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:29,999
were currently living on Earth. Gravik meets
with the Skrull Council, a group of Skrulls

468
00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:34,679
who have taken influential identities across
the globe. and they elect him as the new Skrull

469
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:40,004
General. Colonel James Rhodes advises US President
Ritzen on the matter and is sent to London

470
00:41:40,044 --> 00:41:45,849
to meet with Fury. Rhodey holds Fury responsible
for the Moscow attack and Maria Hill's death,

471
00:41:46,209 --> 00:41:52,014
discharging him from his role at Sabre and within
the US government. Agent Falsworth interrogates

472
00:41:52,054 --> 00:41:57,519
a captured Skrull who reveals that Gravik is
experimenting with Skrull DNA to create Super

473
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:04,104
Skrulls. Fury returns home to his wife. a scroll
named Vara disguised as Priscilla Davis, who

474
00:42:04,124 --> 00:42:09,448
was living in London. Again, a lot of shocking
surprises here. This episode was a little bit

475
00:42:09,488 --> 00:42:14,011
slower than the first episode, but I think it
was still really solid. I was really enjoying

476
00:42:14,051 --> 00:42:18,454
the show at this point. Yeah, I didn't even
mind the slow moments. I'm really glad that

477
00:42:18,474 --> 00:42:24,419
the series as a whole was relatively short,
only six episodes. I think the level of intrigue

478
00:42:24,459 --> 00:42:27,981
was able to be maintained throughout the whole
series, and it definitely kept my attention.

479
00:42:28,021 --> 00:42:32,603
So. It didn't feel as long as it actually was.
I got through the whole thing in, you know,

480
00:42:32,643 --> 00:42:36,765
just two days and I was, you know, glued to
the screen the whole time. That's a good compliment

481
00:42:36,785 --> 00:42:40,867
to the show, actually. Yeah, I think so. I liked
it again. You know, I definitely didn't have

482
00:42:40,887 --> 00:42:44,549
all the qualms that you and other fans have
had. What did you think about Rody in this

483
00:42:44,589 --> 00:42:49,031
episode? I didn't suspect him as a scroll at
this point. I just thought he was being a fucking

484
00:42:49,091 --> 00:42:55,678
asshole. I should have suspected him as a scroll.
I thought he was a scroll in the comics. So

485
00:42:55,858 --> 00:43:00,539
I straight from the get-go assumed that he was
going to be one. I honestly thought potentially

486
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:06,501
everyone in the show besides Fury could be a
Skrull. I think I was definitely dumb for not

487
00:43:06,761 --> 00:43:11,982
immediately suspecting him considering he was
the only other big name player in the season

488
00:43:12,162 --> 00:43:15,943
that they could have done that sort of shocking
twist with. Yeah, I assumed they were going

489
00:43:15,963 --> 00:43:19,864
to do that with everyone. They did it with Everett
K. Ross, called that straight from the beginning.

490
00:43:20,084 --> 00:43:24,658
The only one who wasn't a Skrull that I thought
was going to be one was Agent Fallsworth. Let's

491
00:43:24,678 --> 00:43:29,700
go ahead and move on to episode 3 which is called
Betrayed. In it, Gravik shows the Skrull Council

492
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:34,122
his Super Skrull device and tells of his plan
to be the first test subject and explains how

493
00:43:34,142 --> 00:43:39,004
he has infiltrated the British Royal Navy to
attack a United Nations aircraft. In the late

494
00:43:39,084 --> 00:43:45,467
90s, we see Fury meet with Vara, a Skrull diplomat
serving as official liaison between the refugees

495
00:43:45,547 --> 00:43:50,409
and Fury, and the two fall in love. Back in
the present, Talos meets with Gravik regarding

496
00:43:50,449 --> 00:43:55,551
his daughter Gaia. who manages to sneak a message
to her father, warning him of Gravik's upcoming

497
00:43:55,651 --> 00:44:00,753
Royal Navy attack. Talos and Fury learn who's
in charge of the Navy vessel from Agent Falsworth,

498
00:44:01,173 --> 00:44:06,255
and they infiltrate his home, revealing him
to be a Skrull. Talos assumes his identity

499
00:44:06,536 --> 00:44:12,678
to call off the Navy strike using a password
acquired by Gaia. Outed as a rebel Skrull traitor,

500
00:44:12,918 --> 00:44:18,260
Gaia flees the Skrull compound, but is intercepted
by Gravik, who shoots her dead. Meanwhile,

501
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:24,055
Vara is given orders to kill her husband Fury,
revealing her as part of the Skrull Rebellion.

502
00:44:24,476 --> 00:44:28,418
This was a fantastic episode. I think it was
actually the best of the entire season. I think

503
00:44:28,438 --> 00:44:34,122
it had the best moment where Fury and Talos
single handedly infiltrates the Royal Navy

504
00:44:34,142 --> 00:44:38,165
commander's home. I thought that was filled
with a lot of tension. Although I did think

505
00:44:38,185 --> 00:44:43,969
it was anticlimactic that the commander's password
was his son's name. Yeah, that's pretty basic.

506
00:44:43,989 --> 00:44:48,953
You never use your children's name as your password,
people. Come on. That's some basic shit right

507
00:44:48,993 --> 00:44:55,248
there. For real. I remember being super shocked
that Gaia was killed at the end of this episode.

508
00:44:55,788 --> 00:44:58,889
I had no idea that she was coming back, I thought
she was done for, especially since she had

509
00:44:58,909 --> 00:45:03,531
like transformed into her Skrull self. I was
like, oh, that means she's super dead. I didn't

510
00:45:03,571 --> 00:45:08,214
even think about the concept of her using the
Super Skrull device. That is a pet peeve of

511
00:45:08,254 --> 00:45:11,975
mine where they do that. They're like, oh, here's
a flashback that you didn't know that kind

512
00:45:12,015 --> 00:45:16,357
of solves everything. It's like, all right.
Well, that was until the next episode. But

513
00:45:16,517 --> 00:45:21,354
uh. At the end of this episode, we hear Rhodey
speak with Nick Fury's wife. And I could totally

514
00:45:21,394 --> 00:45:25,598
tell that it was Don Cheadle's voice. Because
I think he has a very distinctive voice. I

515
00:45:25,618 --> 00:45:30,923
was like, OK, so Rhodey is a Skrull. OK, right.
Right. How did you watch the show? Was it week

516
00:45:30,943 --> 00:45:35,387
to week or did you binge it? I binge the first
two episodes and then I watched the rest week

517
00:45:35,407 --> 00:45:38,870
to week. Yeah, I probably would have gotten
frustrated with the show like this, watching

518
00:45:38,931 --> 00:45:43,470
it week to week. I enjoyed binging it. It was
very bingeable. Things like, you know, Gaia

519
00:45:43,530 --> 00:45:49,474
being shot dead wasn't a problem for me for
very long. It was like a 15 second problem.

520
00:45:49,855 --> 00:45:54,378
Let's go ahead and move on to episode 4, which
is called Be Loved. In it, it's revealed that

521
00:45:54,398 --> 00:45:59,021
before fleeing the Rebel Scroll base, Gaia used
Gravik's Super Scroll Machine to give herself

522
00:45:59,041 --> 00:46:03,884
an extremis healing factor that saves her life.
Vara meets with Rody, who turns out to be a

523
00:46:03,944 --> 00:46:09,488
Skrull named Reva in disguise, and they discuss
Fury's fate, as Fury listens to their conversation

524
00:46:09,528 --> 00:46:14,155
through a bug he planted on his wife. Talos
meets with Gaia, and the two are shown to have

525
00:46:14,335 --> 00:46:18,798
irreconcilable differences over the fate of
their people. Where Talos is content hiding

526
00:46:18,838 --> 00:46:23,220
in secret, his daughter wants the Skrulls to
have their own home living in their own skin.

527
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:28,583
Fury confronts Vara, but she confesses that
she truly loves him and could never hurt him.

528
00:46:28,943 --> 00:46:34,366
He then visits Skrull Rody and plants a liquid
tracker on him. Talos and Fury follow him and

529
00:46:34,406 --> 00:46:39,269
President Ritson's convoy, which Gravik and
his men attack, presenting themselves as Russian

530
00:46:39,289 --> 00:46:44,412
terrorists. Though Fury and Talos manage to
save the President's life, Talos is killed

531
00:46:44,472 --> 00:46:49,594
in the firefight. That whole firefight scene
was pretty cool. It was the first time we got

532
00:46:49,634 --> 00:46:54,557
to see the Super Scroll powers outside of Extremis.
I didn't initially register his stretching

533
00:46:54,597 --> 00:46:58,880
ability as group powers, even though I probably
should have because they definitely looked

534
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:04,543
like roots extending outward, but I really liked
it when they addressed that those were in fact

535
00:47:04,743 --> 00:47:10,278
a Flora Colossus ability. Well I recognized
it even before they explicitly said that. when

536
00:47:10,358 --> 00:47:15,041
Gaia was on the computer looking at the different
DNA samples that they had in like episode 2

537
00:47:15,061 --> 00:47:19,885
or 3. So I was waiting for something like that
to pop up. Oh yeah, I guess I didn't pay attention

538
00:47:20,005 --> 00:47:25,709
close enough to the monitors. Episode 5 is called
Harvest. In it, the Skrull Rebellion loses

539
00:47:25,749 --> 00:47:30,473
faith in Gravik following his failure to kill
the President or Nick Fury, which incites a

540
00:47:30,553 --> 00:47:36,277
mutiny that Gravik stops. Fury takes the President
to the hospital and confronts Skrull Rody.

541
00:47:36,782 --> 00:47:41,884
who reveals that he leaked footage of the Moscow
attack, implicating Fury in Maria Hill's death

542
00:47:42,284 --> 00:47:47,206
and turning Nick Fury into a wanted man. Fury
visits Gaia at a safe house where she tells

543
00:47:47,246 --> 00:47:52,148
him that Gravik's Super Scroll process involves
infusing Skrull DNA with those of Earth's other

544
00:47:52,188 --> 00:47:57,730
heroes and villains, including Extremis soldiers,
Groot, and Thanos' henchmen, Cull Obsidian,

545
00:47:58,070 --> 00:48:02,892
and that he is looking specifically for the
Harvest DNA samples, which contains genetic

546
00:48:02,932 --> 00:48:07,338
material from everyone in the battle against
Thanos. called the Battle of Earth in Avengers

547
00:48:07,438 --> 00:48:12,340
Endgame. On orders from Gravik, Skrull-Rody
tries to convince President Ritsin that the

548
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:17,641
attack was from a Skrull group harbored by Russia
and advises him to attack the Rebel Skrull

549
00:48:17,661 --> 00:48:23,263
compound on Russian soil. Gaia and Vara hold
a funeral for Talos and fend off Rebel Skrulls

550
00:48:23,283 --> 00:48:28,124
sent to assassinate them for their betrayal.
Gravik calls Fury asking for him to bring him

551
00:48:28,164 --> 00:48:33,587
the Harvest Sample in exchange for saving the
Skrull compound. Fury partners with Agent Fallsworth

552
00:48:33,627 --> 00:48:38,491
to help him avoid authorities as he travels
with her to Finland to retrieve the sample,

553
00:48:38,771 --> 00:48:43,775
preparing to confront Gravik. I thought this
was a great episode. I did find it kind of

554
00:48:43,815 --> 00:48:48,439
strange that even though Gaia was kind of on
the run for being a Skrull traitor, neither

555
00:48:48,499 --> 00:48:53,643
she nor Fury's wife ever changed their human
forms. Like they could have easily gone into

556
00:48:53,683 --> 00:48:59,688
hiding by becoming someone else, they just chose
not to. The whole Skrull rationalization for

557
00:48:59,908 --> 00:49:05,197
remaining in human form. obviously was to reduce
the special effects and make a budget for the

558
00:49:05,217 --> 00:49:10,041
show. Right. They explained it as like the more
you're in this human form, the harder it is

559
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:15,046
for you to detect. But I also feel like the
scrolls were in their human forms too much

560
00:49:15,566 --> 00:49:19,810
and that they didn't transform in times where
it would have been convenient for them to.

561
00:49:20,251 --> 00:49:25,175
Yeah, I definitely agree. The action scene with
Gaia and Vara, though, was pretty badass. Those

562
00:49:25,195 --> 00:49:29,955
two ladies crushed it, I thought, in that shoot
out. Not gonna lie, it makes me want to set

563
00:49:29,995 --> 00:49:36,059
up like a hidden backpack, like weapon cache
thing in my own home, just so I could be prepared

564
00:49:36,099 --> 00:49:41,042
like them. I don't know who would attack my
home, but weapons are cool. I could do it.

565
00:49:41,543 --> 00:49:47,026
Okay. We'll just do a super soakers, it'll be
awesome. Yeah, yeah, just do, we'll do the

566
00:49:47,066 --> 00:49:52,430
airsoft version. Let's go ahead and move on
to episode six, which is called Home. In It,

567
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:58,146
Fury confronts Gravik at the Rebel Scroll compound,
offering to hand over the harvest sample if

568
00:49:58,186 --> 00:50:03,527
Gravik leaves the planet to conquer some other
world for the Skrulls. Gravik refuses and berates

569
00:50:03,567 --> 00:50:09,049
Fury for deceiving the Skrull refugees, getting
Fury to admit that he knew he and Captain Marvel

570
00:50:09,109 --> 00:50:13,890
couldn't find a new world for them, but that
it was easier to save humanity from the Skrulls

571
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:19,071
than to convince it to accept them. Agent Fallsworth
tells Rhodey that he and the President's Guard

572
00:50:19,111 --> 00:50:24,973
are under attack from Fury and the guards slowly
fall one by one. With Fury dying from radiation

573
00:50:24,993 --> 00:50:29,896
sickness at the Rebel Skrull compound, Gravik
activates the Super Scroll machine and attacks

574
00:50:29,916 --> 00:50:35,801
Fury, who reveals himself as Gaia in disguise
who also receives the Harvest's powers. In

575
00:50:35,841 --> 00:50:41,105
actuality Fury is at the hospital with Agent
Fallsworth where he shoots and kills Skrull

576
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:46,209
Rody, proving to President Ritzen the Skrull
deception against him. Gaia and Gravik fight,

577
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:51,274
with Gaia avenging her parents by blasting a
hole through Gravik's chest, killing him. She

578
00:50:51,294 --> 00:50:57,198
then sets the Skrull prisoners free, including
Everett K. Ross and James Rhodes. In the aftermath,

579
00:50:57,458 --> 00:51:02,882
President Ritson declares war on all offworld
species, causing unrest among civilians as

580
00:51:03,022 --> 00:51:08,006
armed vigilantes murder those they think are
Skrulls. Agent Falsworth partners with Gaia

581
00:51:08,086 --> 00:51:13,010
as they visit another Skrull compound with more
captive humans. Fury leaves the planet with

582
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:18,634
Vara to attend a peace summit between the Kree
and the Skrulls. I gotta say the last 10 minutes

583
00:51:19,194 --> 00:51:23,737
of this season really dropped the ball. The
episode was the shortest in the entire season.

584
00:51:24,158 --> 00:51:29,782
I think they should have really took the time
to end this show correctly and not just rush

585
00:51:29,842 --> 00:51:34,706
it like they did. It felt largely unsatisfying.
And I think is a large reason why a lot of

586
00:51:34,746 --> 00:51:38,689
people have a better taste in their mouth when
it comes to this show. I think if they would

587
00:51:38,709 --> 00:51:44,354
have just extended that whole ending, what felt
like a montage by like an additional 15 or

588
00:51:44,394 --> 00:51:48,337
20 minutes, I think it would have made all the
difference in the world. I was very confused

589
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:54,682
by what Gaia found in that basement. So it was
another Skrull compound. Yeah, it was a bunch

590
00:51:54,702 --> 00:51:59,863
of other people whose memories were stolen by
the Skrulls who had their identities taken.

591
00:52:00,323 --> 00:52:04,985
So they're gonna work to stop those Skrulls
now? She's gonna do that as like their new

592
00:52:05,045 --> 00:52:10,226
leader? Your guess is as good as mine as to
what the implications were there. It largely

593
00:52:10,266 --> 00:52:14,907
felt like they were setting up a lot of vague
plot points for a secret invasion season 2,

594
00:52:15,407 --> 00:52:22,069
but season 2 hasn't been confirmed, so it's
unknown if we'll ever get a continuation to

595
00:52:22,149 --> 00:52:26,347
these plot points. I'm really curious to see
as to what the ramifications are going to be

596
00:52:26,787 --> 00:52:32,829
in the larger MCU from this show. Like, the
president declaring war on all offworlders,

597
00:52:33,130 --> 00:52:38,492
does that mean that they're going to attack
the Asgardian camp now? If they want their

598
00:52:38,512 --> 00:52:44,114
heads shot up their asses, they're welcome to
try. I just, I feel like that was kind of irresponsible

599
00:52:44,414 --> 00:52:48,956
of the MCU. Yeah, it's almost like they kind
of wrote themselves into a corner because if

600
00:52:48,996 --> 00:52:56,419
it doesn't get addressed, phase four, I think
in general, and now apparently phase five,

601
00:52:56,879 --> 00:53:02,460
is that the MCU is setting up so many individual
plot threads and so many new corners of the

602
00:53:02,481 --> 00:53:07,262
larger Marvel Cinematic Universe that aren't
being addressed in the same way that they were

603
00:53:07,382 --> 00:53:12,764
in previous phases. Like, who knows what the
hell happened with the Eternals situation,

604
00:53:12,944 --> 00:53:17,965
you know? What's happening with the Incursions
and with the multiverse? We have the Atlanteans

605
00:53:18,005 --> 00:53:22,536
introduced. the underground society of monster
hunters and the werewolf by night special.

606
00:53:22,817 --> 00:53:28,061
So many different like threads now that are
branched out almost exponentially. The Marvel

607
00:53:28,101 --> 00:53:32,805
Cinematic Universe definitely feels less cohesive
than it's ever been in its existence. Yeah,

608
00:53:32,885 --> 00:53:37,649
I definitely feel like fans are starting to
turn on it, especially seeing some of the ire

609
00:53:37,729 --> 00:53:43,314
online for even a show like this. Yeah, it makes
me think that superhero fatigue is definitely

610
00:53:43,394 --> 00:53:48,762
setting in. Marvel can just kind of like string
all this together into something that feels

611
00:53:48,882 --> 00:53:54,186
really cohesive and makes sense, I think they'll
win fans back. But they gotta work on funneling

612
00:53:54,346 --> 00:53:59,050
all this new stuff and really convincing people
to keep up with everything. I guess we'll see

613
00:53:59,090 --> 00:54:03,514
how much this show ties into the larger MCU
when we see the Marvels, because that's when

614
00:54:03,534 --> 00:54:08,898
we're gonna see Nick Fury again. Right. So relatively
soon. Yeah, hopefully if the movie doesn't

615
00:54:08,918 --> 00:54:13,722
get delayed. That's right. We'll see. But that
doesn't for this season. I remember walking

616
00:54:13,782 --> 00:54:19,746
away from the show because of the lackluster
10 minutes that happened. feeling that I disliked

617
00:54:19,766 --> 00:54:24,809
the show more than I actually did. Once I started
writing out the plot breakdowns and the character

618
00:54:24,829 --> 00:54:30,532
breakdowns and stuff, I really came to appreciate
the season despite all of its plot holes. Considering

619
00:54:30,792 --> 00:54:35,215
everything, how much I enjoyed it and how much
I questioned what was in it, I'm going to give

620
00:54:35,255 --> 00:54:41,658
the season 3.5 stars. In summary, the show's
capable actors and mature tone make for mostly

621
00:54:41,698 --> 00:54:47,341
enjoyable viewing but can't fully save a plot-hold
riddled story that bumbles its resolution.

622
00:54:47,798 --> 00:54:53,099
For Rotten Tomatoes though, I'm giving it a
fresh rating. Because ultimately, I recommend

623
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:57,280
it and think it's worth watching, despite the
fact it didn't entirely live up to what I thought

624
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:02,301
it could or should be. I think there's potential
in the series, not only for a Season 2 of Secret

625
00:55:02,321 --> 00:55:07,563
Invasion, but for the entire MCU. I didn't dislike
it as much as other people, I actually really

626
00:55:07,583 --> 00:55:12,064
liked it when you were first talking about a
3.5 star rating. I thought that was pretty

627
00:55:12,104 --> 00:55:17,105
harsh. I'd give it honestly like a 4. Bringing
up some of the plot points that you mentioned.

628
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:22,392
does kind of downgrade the show for me, but
definitely not enough to get to like a three.

629
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:27,555
So I agree that a three point five rating is
appropriate. I'd probably give it a four, but

630
00:55:27,655 --> 00:55:31,617
ultimately this is, you know, your review. And
if you want to give it a three point five,

631
00:55:32,157 --> 00:55:38,201
sure. Fuck Marvel, right? I just have higher
standards than you as a fan of Marvel. I think

632
00:55:38,221 --> 00:55:45,244
that's apparent because I can't stand DC. So
what you DC simpletons will enjoy anything.

633
00:55:45,725 --> 00:55:50,850
Obviously, anything. Oh my gosh. If you like
DC. It was confused with Marvel fans, bro.

634
00:55:51,291 --> 00:55:54,892
