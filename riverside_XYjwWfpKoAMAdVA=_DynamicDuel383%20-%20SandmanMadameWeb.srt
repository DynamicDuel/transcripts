00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,963
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,374 --> 00:00:28,855
Welcome to the dynamic duel podcast a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:34,677
the superiority between Marvel and DC By comparing
their characters and stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:35,297 --> 00:00:40,839
I'm marvelous Joe and I'm his twin brother Johnny
DC And in this episode we're going to find

5
00:00:40,919 --> 00:00:46,780
out who would win in a fight between Sandman
the Wesley Dodds version of the character against

6
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,643
Madame Webb the Julia carpenter version of the
character Yeah, there's multiple iterations

7
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:57,767
of these characters with the same names, but
these two specific characters are pretty badass.

8
00:00:57,787 --> 00:01:02,371
They wear trench coats. They have premonitions.
They knock other people unconscious. We thought

9
00:01:02,391 --> 00:01:06,734
it was a pretty good match up. And this, of
course, is in lead up to our next episode,

10
00:01:07,135 --> 00:01:12,539
which is a review of the Dead Boy Detectives
on Netflix, which takes place in the Sandman

11
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:19,665
universe. A different Sandman. Right. But Wesley
Dodds is like Sandman adjacent. It's... Don't

12
00:01:19,685 --> 00:01:24,760
worry about it. You'll learn all about it later
on. Yeah, I mean, and also the Madame Web movie

13
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,283
came out a few months ago. So this is kind of
timely. Yeah, I guess I forgot all about that

14
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:33,725
movie. Before we get into that duel where we
input the character statistics and run 1000

15
00:01:34,046 --> 00:01:38,008
simulations to find out who would win, we're
going to break down the latest comic book movie

16
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:43,851
news that came out this past week, of which
there were two items, both DC animation related.

17
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:49,206
We got the official trailer for My Adventures
with Superman season two. and a teaser for

18

But with that out of the way, quick to the

41
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:17,665
no prize! A no prize is an award Marvel used
to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic

42
00:04:17,705 --> 00:04:22,429
duel No Prize, is a digital award we post on
Instagram for the person that we feel gave

43
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:27,912
the best answer to our question of the week.
Last week as a tie-in to the Deadpool and Wolverine

44
00:04:27,972 --> 00:04:34,468
trailer, we asked... other than Wolverine, what
Fox X-Men character do you most hope appears

45
00:04:34,848 --> 00:04:39,591
in Deadpool and Wolverine and why? And we got
three answers so let's go ahead and run down

46
00:04:39,631 --> 00:04:43,933
our two honorable mentions as well as the no
prize winner. Our first honorable mention goes

47
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:49,597
to Judson Batty who said, Hi guys Judson Batty
here. In the last episode you called me a Brit.

48
00:04:49,817 --> 00:04:54,379
I'm actually Australian but whatever. I would
say that the Fox X-Men character I want to

49
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:59,354
come over the most is Caliban from Logan because
I feel like he could really fit. the theme

50
00:04:59,374 --> 00:05:06,779
of the movie. He could help them find a character
or a place that they need to do because that

51
00:05:06,819 --> 00:05:13,684
is pretty much what he does. And I feel like
it would really be a way to tie film back into

52
00:05:13,744 --> 00:05:18,887
Logan. We do have two important corrections
to make from Judson Batty's answer in the last

53
00:05:18,907 --> 00:05:23,535
episode. The first correction is that, I don't
know what I was spoken. Sean Connery is not

54
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:28,000
alive anymore. I said he was still alive, but
he actually died in 2020, and apparently I'm

55
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:34,387
still in denial. So, sorry about that. Also,
apparently Judson Betty is not from Great Britain,

56
00:05:34,467 --> 00:05:41,494
but is in fact Australian. Oh, Guten Tag! Let's
go skiing in the Australian Alps! Listen to

57
00:05:41,534 --> 00:05:49,239
Mozart's music in Vienna, the capital city of
Australia. But no, Caliban was in the Logan

58
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,682
movie played by Stephen Merchant and he was
fantastic in that role. He did unfortunately

59
00:05:54,722 --> 00:05:59,684
die, but that doesn't mean we couldn't see a
variant of him show up in Deadpool and Wolverine.

60
00:06:00,284 --> 00:06:05,607
And like Judson said, probably direct them to
a specific goal or location since his whole

61
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:11,658
mutant power is the ability to track and detect
the location of other mutants. Yeah, I totally

62
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:15,640
forgot about this character in Logan. I would
love to see him return to the role. Oh, yeah,

63
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,463
for sure. He played the character way better
than the guy who played him in X-Men Apocalypse.

64
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:25,585
That was just weird. Already blocked it. Great
answer, Judson. Let's go ahead and move on

65
00:06:25,605 --> 00:06:33,270
to our next honorable mention, which goes to
Corey Wooten. Who said? Hey, guys, Corey Wooten.

66
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:42,076
I'd like to see Alan Rickson as Sabretooth with
an aesthetic more like with the correct aesthetic

67
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:50,157
more like the original X-Men, but also with
the ability to think, speak, and deliver lines.

68
00:06:53,066 --> 00:06:57,729
Yeah, Sabertooth would be fantastic to see go
up against Wolverine and Deadpool. Alan Richson

69
00:06:57,769 --> 00:07:01,751
never played the character, but he would make
a fantastic Sabertooth. He was played in the

70
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:07,115
original movies by Tyler Maine and then, of
course, by Leif Schreiber in the X-Men Origins

71
00:07:07,155 --> 00:07:11,738
Wolverine movie. Yeah, my vote is for Tyler
Maine to return. I would love to see that.

72
00:07:12,118 --> 00:07:16,882
And maybe we will. It would be cool to see Sabertooth,
Wolverine and Deadpool in a fight considering,

73
00:07:16,922 --> 00:07:20,884
you know, they're all slashy, heely guys. They
would just tear each other to bits and like

74
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:26,308
nothing would happen. They just fight endlessly.
That'd be really cool to see. So great answer,

75
00:07:26,388 --> 00:07:31,993
Corey, but the winner of this week's snow prize
goes to Travis Herndon, who said, What's up,

76
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:36,457
Dynamic Dudes? Travis here, shout out to my
other twins. So my answer would have to be

77
00:07:36,737 --> 00:07:41,241
Mystique, particularly Rebecca's version of
the character. It would be cool to see that

78
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:46,565
actress come back to reprise her role as Mystique.
Also, you could make a little joke that Deadpool

79
00:07:46,585 --> 00:07:50,689
or something brings up the fact that she's been
running around naked in all three of the X-Men

80
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:55,599
movies she was in. only for her to maybe shade
shift into her comic book accurate suit and

81
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,181
give him the middle finger. So yeah, that's
my pick. I love this answer. I think it would

82
00:08:00,201 --> 00:08:04,523
be so cool, yeah, to have Rebecca Romaine as
Mystique show up in the void at the end of

83
00:08:04,563 --> 00:08:09,545
time. And like no one just comments on the fact
that she's essentially naked. And Deadpool's

84
00:08:09,565 --> 00:08:13,387
like looking around like Wolverine is not saying
anything. And Deadpool's like, is seriously

85
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:18,829
no one going to say anything? Lady, put your
fun bags away. This is Disney now. It's family

86
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:23,285
friendly. And then like she just beats his ass
or something like that. I would love that.

87
00:08:23,365 --> 00:08:26,988
If this doesn't happen in the movie, I'm actually
going to be a little bit disappointed. It will

88
00:08:27,028 --> 00:08:32,112
still exist in my headcanon if it's not in the
film. Yeah, I always preferred Rebecca Romaine

89
00:08:32,132 --> 00:08:37,037
to Jennifer Lawrence for Mystique. I hope we
get a return of Rebecca Romaine for this movie.

90
00:08:37,397 --> 00:08:41,600
And going off of what Travis said, yeah, it
would be cool to then see Mystique shape shift

91
00:08:41,641 --> 00:08:46,124
into her more comic book accurate costume with
the white dress. Yeah, because we've never

92
00:08:46,164 --> 00:08:49,784
seen that on film. That'd be awesome. Yeah,
and I hope that's what they do for the MCU

93
00:08:50,005 --> 00:08:54,591
version of the character. So congrats to Travis
Herndon. Fantastic answer. You win this week's

94
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:58,757
No Prize. If you're the listener, want a shot
at winning your own No Prize. Stay tuned to

95
00:08:58,797 --> 00:09:02,802
later on in this episode when we'll be asking
another question of the week. And now that

96
00:09:02,822 --> 00:09:04,885
that's done, on to the news.

97
00:09:10,402 --> 00:09:14,983
Alright, so last week we got our first look
at the second season of My Adventures with

98
00:09:15,043 --> 00:09:20,165
Superman, an animated series that's premiering
on Cartoon Network, but also showing on the

99
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:25,666
Max platform. Of course, we reviewed My Adventures
with Superman season one last year. It was

100
00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:31,468
a really, really well done modern anime version
of the Superman mythos. And the way it ended,

101
00:09:31,608 --> 00:09:37,354
it set up season two. So I've been really looking
forward to this first trailer. and it didn't

102
00:09:37,374 --> 00:09:42,395
disappoint. No, it looks like it continues everything
that made the first season so well done. And

103
00:09:42,435 --> 00:09:46,497
not being, you know, a DC or a Superman guy
myself, I really enjoyed the show and it's,

104
00:09:46,717 --> 00:09:51,798
yeah, modern take on the character of Superman.
The way they adapted all of these characters

105
00:09:51,838 --> 00:09:55,999
to kind of fit in with Kryptonian technology
and stuff like that, I thought was really fascinating.

106
00:09:56,079 --> 00:10:00,781
And they really left that first season on quite
the cliffhanger with Brainiac and General Lane

107
00:10:00,821 --> 00:10:04,878
and all that stuff. So yeah, this is gonna be
exciting. Yeah, definitely more of the same,

108
00:10:04,918 --> 00:10:08,859
which is great to see the opening shot of the
trailer. It looks like Lois Lane and Jimmy

109
00:10:08,919 --> 00:10:13,521
Olsen are encountering a Kryptonian, although
I'm not sure who it is, whether it's General

110
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:18,802
Zod or someone else, maybe. I guess we'll see.
It looks like the trio of Clark Kent, Lois

111
00:10:18,842 --> 00:10:24,004
Lane and Jimmy Olsen are getting up to their
wacky hijinks as they have in the past. It

112
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:29,354
was a fun reminder that Jimmy Olsen is now a
millionaire. So, you know, he's. talking at

113
00:10:29,434 --> 00:10:33,197
this conference, that's gonna be interesting
this season. But what I thought was really

114
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:38,001
cool was to see the return of Lex Luthor, who
we got like a tease of in the first season,

115
00:10:38,382 --> 00:10:43,046
but it looks like it's officially him. He was
Ivo's assistant or something like that. And

116
00:10:43,086 --> 00:10:49,231
it makes sense that with Ivo out, Lex Luthor
may be taking over the tech space and competing

117
00:10:49,251 --> 00:10:54,496
with Jimmy Olsen. I thought it was cool how
we got our first looks at characters like Metallo,

118
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:59,679
Parademons, and of course, Supergirl. Oh yeah,
Supergirl was a huge surprise. She, of course,

119
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:05,102
is in the poster for the upcoming season. And
I was really happy to see that she'll be here.

120
00:11:05,763 --> 00:11:10,906
Clark Kent does encounter a baby version of
her at the very end of the trailer, although

121
00:11:10,926 --> 00:11:16,469
I'm not sure if that's just like a flashback
to the past when she was also, you know, rocketed

122
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:21,652
off of Krypton before it was destroyed or not.
I guess we'll find out. Another villain we

123
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:26,058
get to see in this trailer is Brainiac. And
it's gonna be really interesting to see his

124
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:32,321
dynamic with Zod, because it looks like a lot
of the Kryptonian tech is powered by Brainiac.

125
00:11:32,641 --> 00:11:37,243
I think we also get our first look at John Henry
Irons' steel in this trailer too. It's more

126
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,885
like a prototype mech suit. I'm not quite sure
if it's steel, but that would be cool if we

127
00:11:40,905 --> 00:11:44,787
got him in this season too. Yeah, I would love
that. I imagine they would kind of take the

128
00:11:44,827 --> 00:11:50,589
same route they took with his origin in the
New 52, tying him into Metallo. At least I

129
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:56,080
hope they do. But it looks like this season
kicks off at the end of this month on May 25th

130
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,842
on the Cartoon Network. The shows will be then
showing up on MAX the following day. We're

131
00:12:01,882 --> 00:12:06,884
definitely going to review this upcoming season
and I can't wait to do so. I can't wait to

132
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:11,647
see all the cool new villains that they adapt
for this show. Yes, definitely one of the more

133
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:16,469
interesting aspects of the show. But speaking
of villains, that brings us to our question

134
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:16,949
of the week.

135
00:12:21,486 --> 00:12:26,389
Who is your favorite Superman villain and why?
This is going to be a tough one, there's a

136
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:30,893
lot of great Superman villains out there. Really
dig deep on the why portion of your answer.

00:12:43,143 --> 00:12:47,947
the podcast. We'll pick our favorite answer,
and award that person a dynamic duel no prize

141
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:54,287
that we'll post to Instagram. Be sure to answer
before... May 11th. In other DC animated news,

142
00:12:54,368 --> 00:13:00,131
we got the first official teaser trailer for
Justice League Chrysalis Infinite Earths Part

143
00:13:00,171 --> 00:13:07,617
3. Of course, we reviewed Part 2 in our last
episode. Spoiler alert, it wasn't that great

144
00:13:07,697 --> 00:13:13,901
and it really didn't get me too pumped up for
Part 3. And I can't say this official teaser

145
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:21,902
did either. It's very much a tease. And primarily
it's a tease that Lex Luthor in the whole crisis

146
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:27,747
mix although it's unclear as to which version
of Lex Luthor this is. The teaser kind of makes

147
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:34,433
it seem like he's a bad guy but if this is Lex
Luthor from Earth 3 and maybe he survived that

148
00:13:34,493 --> 00:13:40,358
universe's destruction somehow then he could
be a huge asset to defeating the Anti-Monitor

149
00:13:40,538 --> 00:13:46,123
without anyone realizing it. Of course we get
to see the Anti-Monitor in this trailer and

150
00:13:46,183 --> 00:13:51,764
he looks terrible. I just gotta say it. He looks
nothing like he does in the comics. I wish

151
00:13:51,784 --> 00:13:55,688
he was more comics accurate because this is
a weird look for the character. This is a little

152
00:13:55,708 --> 00:14:01,334
bit generic. He's just this figure all in black
with red eyes. And that's it exactly. That's

153
00:14:01,514 --> 00:14:08,081
it exactly. Lame. I often boast about how good
the character design is in the tomorrow verse,

154
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:13,830
but this makes me embarrassed of the tomorrow
verse. Just this design. It was interesting

155
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:18,494
to see the Batman animated series, Batman and
Joker. It seems like we're doing a lot more

156
00:14:18,594 --> 00:14:23,858
universe hopping, including the DC animated
universe, which incorporates like Superman

157
00:14:23,898 --> 00:14:28,122
cartoon, the Batman cartoon, the Justice League
cartoon. That's pretty interesting. That was

158
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:32,165
very interesting. I'm wondering how many other
different animated universes are going to pop

159
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:39,991
up. Like Teen Titans go? No idea. That would
be weird. They've already had their own crisis

160
00:14:40,051 --> 00:14:44,878
on their show, so I would be surprised, but
You know, anything's possible, honestly. I

161
00:14:44,938 --> 00:14:50,680
really do hope that this is good. I really do
hope that this brings closure to decades of

162
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,501
DC's animated media, maybe going all the way
back to like Superman's Max Fleischer cartoons.

163
00:14:55,801 --> 00:15:01,583
That would be really cool. And I think really
give us a good setup for maybe James Gunn's

164
00:15:01,823 --> 00:15:06,224
new universe. That would be awesome. Do you
mean Creature Commandos, the animated series

165
00:15:06,244 --> 00:15:11,205
that's coming out later this year? Yes, exactly.
That's scheduled to come out in late 2024.

166
00:15:12,306 --> 00:15:17,570
as part of the whole Gods and Monsters chapter
of James Gunn's DC Universe. I'm not sure if

167
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:22,334
that's still the case though. I have a feeling
that might get pushed back to after Superman.

168
00:15:22,795 --> 00:15:27,119
Or at least I wouldn't be surprised if it did.
There's no release date for this film yet.

169
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:31,142
At the very end of the trailer it just says
it's coming soon. I imagine sometime in the

170
00:15:31,182 --> 00:15:34,885
fall. And when it does, we'll review it. Fingers
crossed it's good.

171
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:45,342
Alright, I think that does it for all the news
for this episode, so let's go ahead and get

172
00:15:45,402 --> 00:15:51,872
into the main event where we find out who'd
win in a fight between Sandman, aka Wesley

173
00:15:51,912 --> 00:15:55,417
Dodds, and Madame Webb, aka Julia Carpenter.

174
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:16,134
Alright, Sandman vs. Madame Webb. This is the
Wesley Dodds and Julia Carpenter versions of

175
00:16:16,154 --> 00:16:20,998
the characters respectively. They're both kind
of pulpy characters in that they're terribly

176
00:16:21,018 --> 00:16:26,222
mysterious and they wear trench coats and vaguely
similar power sets as well. Yeah, and that

177
00:16:26,242 --> 00:16:31,106
their main ability is to incapacitate others,
you could say. But they also get premonitions

178
00:16:31,146 --> 00:16:36,330
of the future and they both have kind of like
cool face gear, like Madame Webb wears these

179
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:42,006
glasses because she's blind and Sandman wears
this gas mask. which makes him look extra pulpy.

180
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:47,047
Wesley Dodds is a fantastic character. Yeah,
he's really cool. I'm a really big fan of the

181
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:51,909
character, especially the way they re-imagined
him in Sandman Mystery Theater, which was a

182
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:57,710
vertigo tie-in to the Sandman series. Speaking
of that, Jonathan, what's the difference between

183
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:02,451
the Wesley Dodds version of Sandman and the
Morpheus version of Sandman? They could not

184
00:17:02,511 --> 00:17:10,970
be more different. So one of them is a detective
of sorts who uses sleeping gas. And the other

185
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:16,393
one is essentially the god of dreams or the
embodiment of dreams, you could say. Right.

186
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:22,297
The latter of which had a series on Netflix,
but the former of which, the guy with the sleeping

187
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:29,681
gas gun, he has played a part in the adventures
of the dream god version of Sandman. Yes, tangentially.

188
00:17:29,761 --> 00:17:34,284
He's a character that has appeared in the Sandman
comics. And of course, everybody knows Madame

189
00:17:34,304 --> 00:17:39,094
Webb. She is world famous now that she's had
her own film. Now in that movie, the character

190
00:17:39,134 --> 00:17:45,036
was Cassandra Webb, who in the comics is an
old woman in a chair. She eventually passed

191
00:17:45,056 --> 00:17:49,377
her powers down to Julia Carpenter, who was
played in the Madden Webb film by Sidney Sweeney.

192
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:53,938
This is all very complicated, but hopefully
the characters' backstories that we get into

193
00:17:53,978 --> 00:17:58,399
later will help clear things up. But to explain
the methodology behind our duels, let's go

194
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:03,300
to our sentient duel simulator, Alfred Jarvis
9000. AJ and IK tell our listeners how you

195
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:09,710
go about determining a winner in our duel matchups.
The way I determine a winner between the contestants

196
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:15,792
is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations using
the characters statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation

197
00:18:15,832 --> 00:18:21,533
is a probabilistic model used to determine outcomes
through random sampling. In this case, I randomize

198
00:18:21,573 --> 00:18:26,015
the statistics along a normal distribution as
a way to simulate the many variables that can

199
00:18:26,035 --> 00:18:30,916
occur during battle. The stat parameters are
based on the official Marvel power grid from

200
00:18:30,956 --> 00:18:36,057
which the DC characters statistics are extrapolated.
Additional stat categories are included such

201
00:18:36,097 --> 00:18:41,608
as range, damage potential, versatility and
perception in order to create a more detailed

202
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:46,772
and accurate simulation. The results of the
1000 simulations provide a percentage of wins

203
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:51,234
for each character. The contestant with the
higher percentage is declared the victor as

204
00:18:51,274 --> 00:18:56,618
they have a higher probability to win any given
battle. In an equitable pairing, neither character

205
00:18:56,638 --> 00:19:01,341
should win 100% of the matches. The comic book
stories have shown that there's even a way

206
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:06,407
for Batman to defeat Superman. So the confidence
rate of my method falls in line with the precedents

207
00:19:06,427 --> 00:19:11,469
that have been established in the source material.
My mathematical simulations are without subjectivity

208
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:16,872
or bias. Feats are not the sole consideration,
nor are fan votes tabulated for determination

209
00:19:16,912 --> 00:19:22,634
of the winner. Thanks AJ9K! Before we run the
simulations though, we like to break down each

210
00:19:22,654 --> 00:19:27,556
character's histories and abilities, before
improvising a scenario on how we imagine one

211
00:19:27,576 --> 00:19:32,110
of the 1000 simulations would play out beat
for beat. And I believe it's my turn to go

212
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:37,131
first with the Marvel characters backstory,
so let me tell you guys all about Madame Web.

213
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:43,173
Now the story of Julia Carpenter's transformation
into Madame Web begins with the story of her

214
00:19:43,253 --> 00:19:49,495
predecessor, Cassandra Web, the original Madame
Web. Born in Salem, Oregon, Cassandra suffered

215
00:19:49,535 --> 00:19:55,337
from a condition known as myasthenia gravis,
which left her blind and a quadriplegic confined

216
00:19:55,417 --> 00:20:01,247
to a wheelchair. In spite of her physical handicap-
She developed a strong mind into her later

217
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:07,071
years that was able to tap into the web of life
and destiny, which is a five-dimensional construct

218
00:20:07,131 --> 00:20:12,875
of all reality, past, present, and future. This
endowed her with psychic abilities, which she

219
00:20:12,995 --> 00:20:18,559
used as a medium telling people's fortunes in
New York City, calling herself Madame Web.

220
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:24,323
It was in New York that Cassandra was first
visited by Peter Parker, who was shocked to

221
00:20:24,363 --> 00:20:29,294
learn that she knew of his alternate identity
as Spider-Man. Cassandra assisted him in solving

222
00:20:29,414 --> 00:20:34,215
several mysterious criminal cases, and she became
a valuable asset to Spider-Man's crime-fighting

223
00:20:34,235 --> 00:20:39,177
career. You can learn more about Spider-Man
in his duel against Blue Beetle. Meanwhile,

224
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:44,718
a couple of decades prior to Cassandra meeting
Spider-Man, Julia Cornwall was born and raised

225
00:20:44,758 --> 00:20:50,520
in Los Angeles, California to Walter and Elizabeth
Cornwall. She grew up and married her college

226
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:55,781
boyfriend Larry Carpenter, and the pair moved
to Denver, Colorado, where they had a daughter

227
00:20:55,841 --> 00:21:01,478
named Rachel. Larry became a politician and
Julia joined a PR firm. Five years later, however,

228
00:21:01,518 --> 00:21:07,203
the pair got a divorce and Julia was awarded
custody of their child. While living as a single

229
00:21:07,243 --> 00:21:13,168
mom, Julia ran into her college friend named
Valerie Cooper, who was the chair of the U.S.

230
00:21:13,368 --> 00:21:18,292
Commission on Superhuman Activities, a government
committee involved in dealing with the country's

231
00:21:18,332 --> 00:21:24,117
growing number of superhuman beings. After several
failed attempts to control existing superpowered

232
00:21:24,137 --> 00:21:30,047
beings, the Commission decided it was time to
create its own hero. To that end, they began

233
00:21:30,087 --> 00:21:35,508
recruiting potential candidates for a classified
athletic study, and Chair Valerie Cooper enlisted

234
00:21:35,548 --> 00:21:41,710
her friend Julia to take part in their experiment.
The Commission injected Julia with a formula

235
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:47,512
of rare spider venoms and plant extracts found
in the Amazon rainforest, which ended up gifting

236
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:52,853
her with an enhanced physiology and the ability
to produce strands of telekinetic energy that

237
00:21:52,913 --> 00:21:57,791
manifested like webbing. As the sole success
of their experiment, Julia was dubbed by the

238
00:21:57,811 --> 00:22:02,793
commission Spider-Woman, and they sent her into
the field as a superhero government operative.

239
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:07,795
Juggling her top-secret identity with being
a mother, Julia struggled in both her personal

240
00:22:07,815 --> 00:22:12,717
life and with her activities as a secret agent,
receiving orders that occasionally put her

241
00:22:12,757 --> 00:22:18,280
in conflict with other heroes such as the X-Men
and the Avengers. After helping the Avengers

242
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:24,343
escape the vault prison after they were arrested
on false treason Julia became a wanted fugitive

243
00:22:24,403 --> 00:22:29,726
from the government. Exacerbating the situation,
Julia also found herself in a custody battle

244
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:34,728
over her daughter Rachel with her ex-husband
Larry, who eventually won due to Julia's absence

245
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:40,011
and moved to California. Still on the run, Julia
evaded authorities with help from Iron Man,

246
00:22:40,331 --> 00:22:45,434
and she relocated to California to be closer
to her daughter. There, she joined the West

247
00:22:45,454 --> 00:22:50,737
Coast Avengers branch, which ended her fugitive
status, eventually gaining back custody of

248
00:22:50,777 --> 00:22:56,990
Rachel, as she balanced being a mom and an Avenger.
At this time, she revealed her superhero identity

249
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:01,934
to her daughter and her parents, who were initially
supportive but soon felt that her powers made

250
00:23:01,974 --> 00:23:06,978
her unfit as a mother. After the West Coast
Avengers disbanded, Julia and her daughter

251
00:23:07,058 --> 00:23:12,402
moved back to Denver, where she fought crime
and served as a reserve Avengers member. Eventually,

252
00:23:12,462 --> 00:23:17,538
the stories of Cassandra Webb and Julia Carpenter
would cross when Cassandra's Granddaughter

253
00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:22,861
Charlotte Witter began stealing the powers of
other spider-powered heroes, including Maddie

254
00:23:22,881 --> 00:23:27,023
Franklin and Jessica Drew, the latter of whom
you can learn more about in our Queen Bee vs

255
00:23:27,203 --> 00:23:32,706
Spider-Woman duel episode. The women teamed
up with Cassandra to defeat Witter, and eventually,

256
00:23:32,927 --> 00:23:37,949
Julia had her powers restored by a recreated
spider formula and returned to crime fighting.

257
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:43,232
When the U.S. Congress introduced the Superhuman
Registration Act, which forced heroes to register

258
00:23:43,272 --> 00:23:49,355
with the government or face prosecution, Julia,
now going by the code name Arachne, sided with

259
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:55,038
Iron Man's pro-registration side, but secretly
helped unregistered heroes evade capture, as

260
00:23:55,058 --> 00:24:00,060
she privately disagreed with the legislation.
Julia was ultimately caught, however, and was

261
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:05,302
forcibly arrested in front of her daughter Rachel.
She was offered a pardon for her crimes, however,

262
00:24:05,662 --> 00:24:10,244
provided she serve on the Canadian government's
new superhero team, Omega Flight, which was

263
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:16,147
a spinoff of the country's renowned Alpha Flight
team. Both Julia and Cassandra were kidnapped

264
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:22,112
by the family of Craven the Hunter, who planned
to sacrifice spider-powered heroes in an attempt

265
00:24:22,152 --> 00:24:27,857
to resurrect Craven through an occult ritual.
The family slit Cassandra Webb's throat, who

266
00:24:27,917 --> 00:24:33,181
psychically transferred her ability to mentally
access the Web of Life of Destiny into Julia,

267
00:24:33,301 --> 00:24:38,365
making her the new Madame Webb. Spider-Man was
able to rescue Julia from being sacrificed

268
00:24:38,405 --> 00:24:43,396
as well. though the Craven family was successful
in bringing Craven back from the dead, which

269
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:48,519
you can learn more about in our Vixen vs Craven
duel episode. And though Julia was now blind

270
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:53,522
due to her new insight into the past, present,
and future, her clairvoyance played a crucial

271
00:24:53,582 --> 00:24:58,184
role in helping Spider-Man overcome threats
to New York, and she even saved his life on

272
00:24:58,324 --> 00:25:03,487
multiple occasions. When she experienced a vision
of Spider-Man's death at the hands of Mephisto,

273
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:08,070
an elder demon of hell whom you can learn more
about in his duel against Sandman, Julia formed

274
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:13,311
a team of spider-powered heroes called the Order
of the Web, who fought to protect Spider-Man

275
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:19,213
and fight other supernatural threats. Powers-wise,
Madame Web has the combined power sets of her

276
00:25:19,293 --> 00:25:25,134
former Arachne identity and the original Madame
Web. This grants her enhanced physicality,

277
00:25:25,354 --> 00:25:31,196
including increased strength able to lift around
10 tons, increased agility, speed, and durability.

278
00:25:31,676 --> 00:25:37,730
She can emit strands of telekinetic energy for
a variety of effects, including strands which

279
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:43,274
she can manipulate at will to swing from, ensnare
opponents, and use to bind herself to surfaces

280
00:25:43,374 --> 00:25:49,178
in a wall-crawling effect. She can send out
these psionic strands to use as invisible feelers

281
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:54,382
to detect the environment around her and warn
her of impending danger for a spider sense

282
00:25:54,402 --> 00:25:59,886
effect. Mataweb has access to see into the web
of life and destiny, which she can use to get

283
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:05,578
visions of potential futures, other locations
in the present, and the past. She has limited

284
00:26:05,618 --> 00:26:10,060
telepathy, able to read minds and project her
thoughts into the minds of others, allowing

285
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:15,202
them to see her as an astral projection. She
is also an adept hand-to-hand combatant due

286
00:26:15,222 --> 00:26:19,864
to her training from the Commission on Superhuman
Activities. Her one weakness is that she is

287
00:26:19,944 --> 00:26:25,946
blind, but her psychic perception of her environment
makes this barely a handicap. And that's Madame

288
00:26:25,966 --> 00:26:31,989
Web. So she's like a mixture between Daredevil
and Spider-Man. Uh, with a little bit of Professor

289
00:26:32,089 --> 00:26:37,943
X thrown in there too. Okay. I'm not going to
lie. A little scared, a little scared, a little

290
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:43,444
bit. You should be. But I will argue that Wesley
Dodds is just the cooler character because

291
00:26:43,484 --> 00:26:48,986
you really don't get cooler than Wesley Dodds.
He's so noir and like that pulpy kind of like

292
00:26:49,226 --> 00:26:55,468
the shadow comes in. Avenger Spider-Man or no,
no. Fuck that guy. That guy's that guy's a

293
00:26:55,528 --> 00:27:01,406
poser. Wesley Dodds is the real deal. Let me
get into his backstory. Now Wesley Dodds was

294
00:27:01,466 --> 00:27:07,729
born in the 1910s to a Jewish couple, Edward
and Marina Dodds, though Marina died in 1917

295
00:27:08,389 --> 00:27:14,191
while Wesley's father served in World War I.
Raised by his military father, Wesley traveled

296
00:27:14,291 --> 00:27:20,854
the Orient, where he acquired various skills
such as herbalism and martial arts. After graduating

297
00:27:20,874 --> 00:27:26,296
from college, Wesley briefly served as a pilot
for the US Navy until his father died.

298
00:27:29,538 --> 00:27:35,583
Wesley also took on the same career as his father
had before the war, an investor. Wesley became

299
00:27:35,703 --> 00:27:41,087
a wealthy socialite, though at night he was
plagued by nightmares of crimes, murders, and

300
00:27:41,107 --> 00:27:48,133
a mysterious figure in a strange mask. Unbeknownst
to Wesley, the lord of the dream world, Morpheus,

301
00:27:48,414 --> 00:27:53,718
had been imprisoned by a British occultist named
Roderick Burgess, causing many individuels

302
00:27:53,758 --> 00:27:59,282
around the world to have strange sleeping patterns,
Wesley being one of them. After realizing the

303
00:27:59,322 --> 00:28:04,464
events in his dreams were coming true, Wesley
decided he needed to do something about it

304
00:28:04,804 --> 00:28:10,006
and created a secret laboratory in his basement
where he experimented with various herb and

305
00:28:10,046 --> 00:28:15,889
chemical mixtures to craft a formula for a powerful
sedative whose vapors could put people into

306
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:22,872
a deep sleep. Initially using a WWI gas mask
to protect him from his own sleeping gas, Wesley

307
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:29,039
became a fedora-wearing vigilante known as the
Sandman. knocking out the criminals and serial

308
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:34,624
killers they had seen in his dreams. Early in
his crime-fighting career, he encountered another

309
00:28:34,664 --> 00:28:40,248
masked vigilante, the Crimson Avenger, who Wesley
thought was a criminal, but turned out to be

310
00:28:40,308 --> 00:28:46,994
his old college friend, the Travis. Lee gave
Wesley a design for a gas gun, which Wesley

311
00:28:47,034 --> 00:28:52,358
crafted and perfected over the years, along
with various other gadgets, including a grappling

312
00:28:52,378 --> 00:28:52,618
gun.

313
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:02,093
Wesley had met and fallen for Diane Belmont,
the daughter of New York City's District Attorney,

314
00:29:02,473 --> 00:29:08,416
Larry Belmont. Within a year, Diane deduced
Wesley's alter ego as the Sandman and began

315
00:29:08,536 --> 00:29:13,699
aiding him in his missions, often feeding him
information from her father's files and acting

316
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:19,903
as his getaway driver. When America became involved
in World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt

317
00:29:19,943 --> 00:29:25,314
recruited Wesley and various other mystery men
to form the Justice Society of America. a team

318
00:29:25,334 --> 00:29:30,496
of superheroes that you could learn more about
in our Justice Society vs. Fantastic Four episode.

319
00:29:30,876 --> 00:29:36,638
While Wesley was away with the JSA, Diane decided
that for one sabotage case she had been working

320
00:29:36,758 --> 00:29:43,241
on to don one of Wesley's Sandman outfits and
ended up being shot and killed by a Nazi agent.

321
00:29:43,561 --> 00:29:49,743
Devastated, Wesley began wearing a new, more
colorful and superheroic outfit that Diane

322
00:29:49,764 --> 00:29:55,638
had designed for him to fight crime. Wesley
also adopted Diane's young nephew. an orphan

323
00:29:55,918 --> 00:30:03,340
named Sanderson Hawkins. Sandy idolized Sandman
and trained hard to be like him one day. Wesley

324
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:08,782
soon revealed his Sandman identity to Sandy,
and Sandy became his crime-fighting sidekick,

325
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:14,703
aiding him in their World War II adventures
with a new expanded wartime superteam known

326
00:30:14,783 --> 00:30:20,165
as the All-Star Squadron. Hoping to improve
his crime-fighting abilities, Wesley engineered

327
00:30:20,325 --> 00:30:28,314
a silicoid gun. which would have used irradiated
silicon to create constructs of sand and glass.

328
00:30:28,774 --> 00:30:34,938
The device exploded upon its first use, however,
bombarding and infusing the radioactive particles

329
00:30:35,078 --> 00:30:41,382
into Sandy, transforming him into a raging sand
monster. Though Wesley was able to sedate and

330
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:48,547
capture Sandy, he was unable to cure him, so
he kept him sedated and hidden in a glass chamber

331
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:57,459
in his basement. Wesley retired from superheroics,
as by this time, many of the Justice Society's

332
00:30:57,499 --> 00:31:03,061
members were forced into retirement when the
US government began requiring all masked Avengers

333
00:31:03,321 --> 00:31:08,782
to reveal their secret identities and operate
strictly under government orders. Wesley spent

334
00:31:08,922 --> 00:31:14,044
decades in retirement trying to find a cure
for Sandy when an earthquake broke Sandy's

335
00:31:14,064 --> 00:31:20,345
glass prison and caused him to go on a mad rampage.
Wesley donned his Sandman outfit once again.

336
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:26,847
and successfully stopped his former protege,
only to learn that Sandy had regained his lucidity

337
00:31:26,887 --> 00:31:31,829
shortly after his imprisonment and had been
conscious all these years. Guilt-stricken,

338
00:31:32,209 --> 00:31:37,670
Wesley retired once again, even going so far
as to get a psychiatrist named Dr. Raymond

339
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:44,012
Baxter to hypnotize him into forgetting he ever
was the Sandman. Wesley eventually remembered

340
00:31:44,052 --> 00:31:49,226
his past, however, and along with other retired
former JSA members, came out of retirement

341
00:31:49,286 --> 00:31:55,027
seemingly one last time to help the Norse gods
prevent the end of the world in Ragnarok in

342
00:31:55,067 --> 00:32:00,029
a continuous and eternal loop within the realm
of Limbo. After the Crisis on Infinite Earths

343
00:32:00,089 --> 00:32:06,330
event merged the multiverse into a single universe,
the JSA members eventually returned from Limbo,

344
00:32:06,731 --> 00:32:13,632
and Wesley retired once more, dream free, and
now with Diane, who had never died in the new

345
00:32:13,692 --> 00:32:14,233
timeline.

346
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:23,854
The two decided to liquidate all of their assets
and travel the world. She died shortly after

347
00:32:23,874 --> 00:32:30,318
the two arrived in Tibet, and Wesley had one
final dream that predicted not only his own

348
00:32:30,459 --> 00:32:36,703
impending death, but the location of who the
next Doctor Fate would be. After sending this

349
00:32:36,763 --> 00:32:41,247
information to his old JSA allies, Wesley was
confronted by the evil

350
00:32:45,654 --> 00:32:51,136
Rather than reveal Dr. Fate's location through
torture, Wesley threw himself off of a mountain

351
00:32:51,156 --> 00:32:57,759
cliff, killing himself. He and Diane were buried
in Valhalla, a cemetery for superheroes, and

352
00:32:57,859 --> 00:33:03,902
Sandy gave the eulogy. After the Flash reset
DC's continuity, Wesley Dodds was the commander

353
00:33:03,962 --> 00:33:11,905
of a gove teleporting paramilitary force known
as the Sandmen on Earth-2. In DC's Prime Universe,

354
00:33:11,925 --> 00:33:18,143
however, Wesley remained dead until Deadman
brought him back to life as a zombie detective

355
00:33:18,483 --> 00:33:25,485
in order to help him in an unresolved case involving
a nigh death cult that Wesley had encountered

356
00:33:25,585 --> 00:33:31,587
decades prior. You can learn more about Deadman
in our Deadman vs. Magic duel episode. Though

357
00:33:31,627 --> 00:33:37,209
Deadman offered to return Wesley back to his
grave, Wesley agreed to help Deadman until

358
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:44,620
the case was finished. Sandman is cursed with
prophetic nightmares, though he is also a trained

359
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:51,583
martial artist, an expert chemist, and an accomplished
inventor, having devised several gas formulas

360
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:59,026
that include a powerful sedative and a truth
serum. He's also engineered a gas gun, a grappling

361
00:33:59,066 --> 00:34:05,789
gun, an experimental silicoid gun, and a gas
mask that not only filters his breathing, but

362
00:34:05,889 --> 00:34:11,195
also allows him to see through the gas and even
breathe underwater. That's the Sandman. Now,

363
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:16,438
I'm not gonna lie. I'm actually a really big
fan of DC's Sandman. He's probably my favorite

364
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:21,381
DC Comics character if I had to boil it down,
being a Marvel fan, you know? I just really

365
00:34:21,421 --> 00:34:26,704
like the look and the pulpiness of the character.
You know, as iconic as someone as Ghost Rider's

366
00:34:26,724 --> 00:34:31,827
look is, I think Sandman's look is just as iconic
with that gas mask and everything like that.

367
00:34:31,927 --> 00:34:37,214
He's really cool. Oh yeah, just seeing like
those glowing eyes in the mist. like walking

368
00:34:37,234 --> 00:34:41,516
through the fog with his fedora and trench coat.
It doesn't get cooler. It's weird, though,

369
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:46,259
that there are so many characters in Marvel
and DC named Sandman. Like you have the Spider-Man

370
00:34:46,279 --> 00:34:50,861
villain who's made out of literal sand. You
have the God of Dreams Sandman, and then you

371
00:34:50,901 --> 00:34:55,624
also have this Sandman who puts people to sleep.
And I just want to state that even though I

372
00:34:55,644 --> 00:35:00,046
think the Wesley Dodds version of the Sandman
looks the coolest out of the three, Marvel

373
00:35:00,066 --> 00:35:04,569
Sandman is still the better character. And you
can learn more about him in our Sandman versus

374
00:35:04,629 --> 00:35:09,288
Red Tornado duel episode. where you'll find
out that he is in fact not the best of the

375
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:11,937
three characters. Judge for yourself is all
I'll say.

podcast network rises above the rest. Prepare

where we settle the debate and settle the score.

384
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:09,918
Well, now that we've got their histories and
abilities out of the way, let's speculate on

385
00:36:09,978 --> 00:36:15,680
how one of the 1000 simulated matches will go.
The winner is determined by simulations, not

386
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:21,702
this speculation, but it's fun to imagine how
this fight could play out. AJ9K, what are the

387
00:36:21,802 --> 00:36:27,283
rules of our speculation? Well, I should say
there are no rules, other than the characters

388
00:36:27,303 --> 00:36:31,845
have no prior knowledge of the other going into
the fight. All they are aware of starting out

389
00:36:32,165 --> 00:36:36,502
is that the other character is a threat that
needs to be eliminated. For the speculation,

390
00:36:36,782 --> 00:36:41,806
the contestants will begin approximately 50
meters apart in a nondescript environment that

391
00:36:41,826 --> 00:36:46,209
will have no bearing on the match itself, as
no environmental statistics are considered

392
00:36:46,249 --> 00:36:51,252
in my simulations. The contestants must earn
victory on their own merit. Alright then, let's

393
00:36:51,272 --> 00:36:56,836
get into it. Sandman and Madame Webb meet on
the battlefield. Who goes first? I'm going

394
00:36:56,856 --> 00:37:02,380
to say that Madame Webb goes first, and she's
going to get a premonition of her winning this

395
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:08,784
match. And she's like, I got this. No, because
Wesley already went first last night when he

396
00:37:08,824 --> 00:37:14,668
choked about this match and how he wins. And
it all starts with Wesley whipping out his

397
00:37:14,708 --> 00:37:19,471
gas gun and just flooding the environment with
sleeping gas. Madam Webb, she's going to fall

398
00:37:19,511 --> 00:37:27,817
asleep. So match over. No, she's going to perceive
the gas cloud coming at her. And so she's going

399
00:37:27,837 --> 00:37:33,527
to leap into the air. and generate this psionic
web and she just walks along it like a tightrope

400
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:38,909
walker above the cloud of gas and the gas isn't
gonna hide Sandman like she's still gonna be

401
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:45,772
able to perceive where he is through her psionic
web feelers. Well feel this! Sandman sees Madame

402
00:37:45,812 --> 00:37:51,595
Web hovering over the gas cloud so he draws
his harpoon gun and fires it right at her and

403
00:37:51,615 --> 00:37:56,397
that harpoon's gonna stick in her shoulder and
she's just gonna get yanked down into the gas

404
00:37:56,437 --> 00:38:01,998
toward him like a fish on a hook. No, she- but
she has her own version of Spidey Sense, right?

405
00:38:02,038 --> 00:38:06,000
So she's gonna detect this harpoon gun being
fired at her. She's gonna leap out of the way

406
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:11,161
off of her tightrope, and she's gonna swing
over to an area of the environment that isn't

407
00:38:11,181 --> 00:38:16,823
filled with gas, but like 15, 20 meters away,
and she's gonna use her psionic webbing to

408
00:38:16,943 --> 00:38:22,144
ensnare Sandman and yank him out of the gas
cloud toward her. And she's just gonna roundhouse

409
00:38:22,164 --> 00:38:27,414
kick him to the floor. No, actually, all she
kicks is a trench coat. because he slipped

410
00:38:27,434 --> 00:38:32,975
it off once he started getting pulled by her
webbing. And when she kicked the coat, she

411
00:38:33,035 --> 00:38:37,857
actually broke a gas capsule that he had in
his pocket. So she just doused herself with

412
00:38:37,917 --> 00:38:45,219
his sleeping gas and put herself to sleep. All
right. But as she's, you know, feeling herself

413
00:38:45,259 --> 00:38:50,360
being sedated at the last second, she's going
to expel her astral form from her physical

414
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:56,062
body, which is now sleeping on the floor and
her astral spirit. is gonna reach out into

415
00:38:56,142 --> 00:39:02,627
Sandman's mind so that he can see her. And he's
gonna be super confused as to like how she's

416
00:39:02,687 --> 00:39:09,032
both sleeping on the ground and in front of
him. And she's gonna swing a punch at him.

417
00:39:09,332 --> 00:39:13,275
And you know, he's gonna dodge it because he
doesn't know that she's actually incorporeal,

418
00:39:13,495 --> 00:39:18,498
but she's gonna keep attacking him to buy her
time to wake up. Okay, well, I mean, to an

419
00:39:18,598 --> 00:39:24,134
outside observer, Sandman's probably just swinging
wildly at the air. But he's a trained martial

420
00:39:24,234 --> 00:39:31,596
artist, so he'd catch on over time when he realizes
that neither his or her attacks are landing,

421
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:37,938
right? So that's when he's gonna rush over to
Madame Webb's real body, you know, still on

422
00:39:37,978 --> 00:39:42,420
the ground, and... I don't know, he's just gonna
start kicking the shit out of her unconscious

423
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,401
body? Well, if he's beating the shit out of
her on the ground, that's gonna snap her out

424
00:39:47,441 --> 00:39:52,410
of her sleep, you know? Plus she's like really
durable, so Sandman kicking her, it's not gonna

425
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:58,752
hurt her as much as he'd probably like. So she's
gonna wake up and immediately she's gonna wrap

426
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:04,074
him up from head to toe in psionic webbing.
So like he can't move his arms, his legs, like

427
00:40:04,114 --> 00:40:09,896
they're just completely ensnared. So he's gonna
fall over and she's gonna return the favor

428
00:40:10,196 --> 00:40:17,010
by kicking the shit out of him while he's incapacitated.
And her kicks hurt a lot worse. All right,

429
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:24,775
well, I mean, little did Madam Webb know, though,
Sandman had a like maximum potent gas capsule

430
00:40:25,035 --> 00:40:30,880
hidden in his sleeve, which he crushes, causing
a cloud of smoke to surround him. And when

431
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,883
Madam Webb breathes that in as she's bidding
the shit out of him, it's going to place her

432
00:40:35,903 --> 00:40:42,468
into a lifelong coma that she never wakes up
from. Match over just as Sandman predicted.

433
00:40:42,888 --> 00:40:47,939
He has capsules that can put people in comas.
Uh, yeah, lifelong comas. He actually has only

434
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:55,723
used this once, but yeah, it's a thing. Okay,
shit. Uh, well, I mean, that's how one potential

435
00:40:55,743 --> 00:41:01,527
scenario could have gone, according to Madam
Web's precognition, you know? So she gets this

436
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:07,490
vision of how that all went down, and she realizes
that if she just rips off Sandman's mask at

437
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:12,433
the start, then, you know, he can't do shit.
So she does that. You know, she rips off his

438
00:41:12,493 --> 00:41:17,703
mask with her web ink back. at the start of
this match, and Sandman instantly puts his

439
00:41:17,803 --> 00:41:24,246
own self to sleep and matches over before it
ever really began. Dude, that- the real timeline

440
00:41:24,326 --> 00:41:29,508
that matters is the one we started with, not
this new bullshit one. It's not multiple timelines.

441
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:35,771
No, everything that happened that we just described
was just a vision of a potential timeline and

442
00:41:35,811 --> 00:41:41,573
what actually happened is Sandman put himself
down for night-night- No, cause Sandman dreamed

443
00:41:41,593 --> 00:41:47,165
about Madam Web- having a premonition about
that potential future, and he just made sure

444
00:41:47,185 --> 00:41:55,691
to pack a backup mask. Okay, but Sandman's dream
of Madam Web's vision altered her vision, so

445
00:41:55,751 --> 00:42:01,235
the new vision incorporates the second mask,
so he's gonna need to bring infinite masks

446
00:42:01,695 --> 00:42:09,220
if he wants to win this thing. Nah, because
he saw that coming too. Man. I don't even know

447
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:16,524
how we leave this off. Like... What actually
happens here? Either Sandman puts Madam Web

448
00:42:16,704 --> 00:42:25,327
into a lifelong coma or none of that ever happened
and Madam Web just steals his mask and he's

449
00:42:25,387 --> 00:42:31,070
screwed. Exactly. One of those scenarios is
gonna happen. We'll go ahead and find out which

450
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:35,911
one by inputting the character stats, running
the simulations and coming back with the winner.

451
00:42:36,392 --> 00:42:37,912
AG9K, hit it.

452
00:42:41,238 --> 00:42:47,102
Processing results. Simulations complete. All
right, this is a pretty fun matchup. It gets

453
00:42:47,122 --> 00:42:53,346
a little bit crazy when characters can perceive
future events. And it quickly spirals into

454
00:42:53,406 --> 00:43:01,152
infinity real quick. Regarding the stats though,
the characters were not very similar at all.

455
00:43:01,232 --> 00:43:05,615
I mean, they were both equal when it came to
things like versatility, fighting skill, and

456
00:43:05,655 --> 00:43:11,475
their range, but they had very little else in
common. Yeah, we said that Sandman came out

457
00:43:11,535 --> 00:43:17,658
on top when it came to evasiveness and intelligence.
We said he was smarter than Madame Webb. But

458
00:43:17,898 --> 00:43:22,941
we said that Madame Webb was much more perceptive
because not only does she have precognitive

459
00:43:22,961 --> 00:43:28,304
visions like Sandman, but she also has her spider
sense. She's also a lot stronger and therefore

460
00:43:28,344 --> 00:43:34,628
can do more physical damage than Sandman. She's
also faster. Yeah, physically, she was definitely

461
00:43:34,728 --> 00:43:41,420
more impressive than Sandman. But does that
really matter when he's smarter? It's kind

462
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,023
of like a brain versus brawn scenario we have
here. I think enough brawn can just beat the

463
00:43:46,043 --> 00:43:53,088
shit out of a brain, for sure. That's what people
with no brains think. Well, Jonathan, considering

464
00:43:53,128 --> 00:43:57,311
these stats, who do you think is going to win
this fight when we get the results? I have

465
00:43:57,331 --> 00:44:05,256
to root for Sandman. He's such an awesome character.
Madame Webb sucks. And those who voted in our

466
00:44:05,336 --> 00:44:13,515
Instagram poll agree. 66% of them said that
Sandman would beat Madame Webb. So about two

467
00:44:13,535 --> 00:44:18,839
thirds. I think those people are just hating
because of the Madame Webb movie and they're

468
00:44:18,859 --> 00:44:24,083
not giving her credit where credit is due. That's
my assumption. Yeah, that's probably fair.

469
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:30,509
But let's find out who really won. AJ 9K, the
results please. Hey, Yuasa. All right, after

470
00:44:30,569 --> 00:44:41,247
running 1000 simulations, the winner between
Sandman and Madame Webb is Madam Web. Psych!

471
00:44:41,867 --> 00:44:49,249
No, it wasn't even really that close. Out of
1000 simulations, Madam Web won 743 matches,

472
00:44:49,569 --> 00:44:59,092
whereas Sandman only won 257. She kind of beat
his ass. But her movie sucked! Uh, I mean this

473
00:44:59,132 --> 00:45:05,574
version of Madam Web had both the psychic powers
and the Spider-Man powers, so... She doesn't

474
00:45:05,634 --> 00:45:09,637
suck as much as, you know, the movie might have
you believe. She's actually pretty badass.

475
00:45:10,117 --> 00:45:15,441
You know, I was looking forward to this match
because Wesley Dodd's Sandman is like my hero

476
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:20,944
and I am not going to lie. I'm super disappointed.
I do have to say, though, I'm still proud of

477
00:45:20,964 --> 00:45:27,189
the guy, even though he lost by a lot. At the
end of the day, Madame Webb will always be

478
00:45:27,229 --> 00:45:31,992
remembered as the character having the shitty
movie. And Wesley Dodd's will always just have

479
00:45:32,032 --> 00:45:37,907
that classic iconic noir vibe to him that you
just can't take away. It's like he's so cool,

480
00:45:38,147 --> 00:45:44,330
he can't lose. That just sounds like a pathetic
coping mechanism for the fact that your boy

481
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:53,294
got humiliated by Madam Webb. Oh yeah, 100%
is. I do not deny that. Which is fine by me,

482
00:45:53,514 --> 00:46:00,577
your disappointment and humiliation is like
my sustenance. I live for that shit. More copium,

483
00:46:00,637 --> 00:46:04,171
straight to the vein. That does it for this
duel guys. Let us know what you thought about

Dead Boy Detectives, which is a spin-off series

492
00:46:50,356 --> 00:46:55,514
of The Sandman, also on Netflix's Terrific Show.
Yeah, my only experience with the Dead Boy

493
00:46:55,554 --> 00:47:01,157
Detectives was their guest appearance on the
Doom Patrol TV series, but that was a fantastic

494
00:47:01,197 --> 00:47:05,299
episode. So, semi-looking forward to the show.
I haven't started it yet, but I've actually

495
00:47:05,319 --> 00:47:09,441
heard good things. I remember I did not like
the trailer, but here's hoping it's as good

496
00:47:09,481 --> 00:47:13,711
as they say. We'll find out next week. That
does it for this episode, we want to give a
