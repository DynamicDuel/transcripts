7
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:10,260
Hi, welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

8
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,240
the superiority between Marvel and DC by
comparing their characters in stat-based battle

9
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,620
simulations. I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin
brother, Marvelous Joe. And there are only six

10
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:28,860
episodes of this podcast left. We're counting
down to our 10th anniversary and final episode and

11
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,380
in this one we are doing a duel between the
characters of Gypsy and Shadowcat. One was a

12
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:41,660
member of the Justice League during the Detroit
era and one is a mainstay of the X-Men. Yeah, it's

13
00:01:41,660 --> 00:01:48,120
probably a crime that we've waited this long to get
to a kitty pride duel. But here we are and I cannot

14
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:53,260
wait for Shadowcat to beat the shit out of this DC
character that I've never even heard of. You've

15
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,920
never heard of Gypsy before? I have never heard of
Gypsy and I don't care to either. Well, I hate to

16
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:05,140
tell you this, but you're gonna hear about her in
this episode. Yeah, be grudgingly so though. I'm

17
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:10,720
gonna laugh when not only she beats Shadowcat,
kitty pride, but also becomes like your new

18
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,440
favorite DC character. That's asking for a lot.
We're gonna find out who's gonna win later on in

19
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,760
this episode. Before that, we're gonna break down
the comic book movie news from the past week of

20
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,240
which there is a doozy, probably one of the biggest
news items to come out in the 10 years of this

21
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:37,600
podcast and that is Netflix is set to buy Warner
Brothers and an $87 billion deal. Shut up. Shut up.

22
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,580
I don't want to hear it. As always, guys, we list our
segment times in our episode description, so feel

23
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:47,140
free to check out the show notes if you want to skip
ahead to a particular topic. Guys, our

24
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:52,060

37
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,540

podcast network. But with that out of the way,

46
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,280
quick to the No Prize. A No Prize is an award that
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version, the

47
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,560
Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award we post on
Instagram for the person that we feel gave the best

48
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,160
answer to our question of the week. Last week, we
asked you guys, what review episode of Dynamic

49
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,480
Dual did you get the most out of? And that was coming
off of the announcement that we had gotten through

50
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,360
all the reviews that we were going to before the
show's finale, at which point we're changing from

51
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,320
a weekly podcast. We got three answers. So let's go
ahead and run down our two honorable mentions as

52
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:30,220
well as the No Prize winner. Our first honorable
mention goes to CJ Kraft, who said, Hey guys, it's

53
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,680
CJ Kraft. And I think my favorite review you guys
have done has been Werewolf by Night. I remember

54
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,800
watching it and thinking I can't wait to see what
the Dynamic Dual guys have to say about this. And

55
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:47,520
you guys for the most part felt the same way I did
about it. Plus, it was just overall a good episode.

56
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,000
So it's going to suck to see you guys go, but I'll be
appreciative for any episodes we do again. Yeah,

57
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,360
Werewolf by Night was interesting to review
largely because it's one of the more unique pieces

58
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,020
of media that Marvel Studios have put out. You
know, it was a special presentation around

59
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:09,460
Halloween a couple years ago. And it's always, I
think, just more fun to review things that are

60
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,820
unique and special. Yeah, honestly, I'm
surprised Marvel hasn't done more with not only

61
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:20,480
those characters, but that format, the short film
format. I feel like they should be releasing a new

62
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:26,680
special presentation at least twice a year, at
least once a year. I would settle for that. I think

63
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,800
you're right, though. They seem easier to
produce. They're a great way to explore

64
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,180
unexplored areas of the Marvel universe. And it's
a great way to get creative and interesting with

65
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,240
the continuity. I can't wait to see Werewolf by
Night and Man Things show up again and Elsa

66
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,780
Bloodstone and another piece of media. Hopefully
they like show up in a midnight sun's movie or

67
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,900
something like that. But who knows when that'll
happen. Overall, I really loved that special

68
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:54,240
presentation and I'm glad CJ Kraft that you
enjoyed what we said about it. And I'm glad that you

69
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,800
felt the same way. Thanks CJ Kraft. Our next
honorable mention goes to Alex Albro, who said,

70
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,800
OK, hear me out. The Batman and Robin review. For
one, this is when the audio no prize answers were

71
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,060
first announced. So all of us calling in get
something out of this one. But I love this movie as a

72
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:15,760
kid and had no idea it had any issues. I'd watch it
multiple times a week and probably burned out the

73
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:21,100
VHS. Robin's costume was sick. The black and
silver costumes were sick. George Clooney is

74
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,920
Batman for me. I guess my mid 20s, I can see your
points on what's bad, but nostalgia hits hard.

75
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,180
This is the best Batman movie in the first DC movie
I've seen. All right, it looks like you got cut off

76
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:35,740
there and I'm not going to lie. This was the last
review I thought anyone would say was their

77
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:43,340
favorite. We just trashed the film. Basically, I
hadn't seen it in maybe decades prior, I think,

78
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:49,480
before reviewing it. And well, it may have some
nostalgic appeal. There's just way too many cod

79
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:55,240
pieces. Yeah, Jonathan has a threshold for how
many cod pieces he'll allow in a movie. I do. Yeah, I

80
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,680
remember actually getting flack from a few
listeners that we even reviewed Batman and Robin

81
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,100
because they're like, we all know this movie
sucks. Why are you wasting your time? And that was

82
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,840
the first time I think I mentioned to listeners
that the reason that Dynamic Duel started, its

83
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:16,220
primary purpose was to review all the Marvel and DC
films that had come out. And the whole dual

84
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:20,500
speculation thing kind of came across as an
afterthought of that, because we would always

85
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,440
argue about the battles. And then we were like, oh,
we could actually use math to kind of figure this

86
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,840
out. But yeah, the goal was to review these films,
whether they were good or bad. We were going to talk

87
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,500
about them. And I'm surprised that considering
when the movie came out and how old we were that we

88
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,100
don't actually have nostalgic value for Batman
and Robin, it was kind of like we just recognized it

89
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:45,200
as pretty damn bad, even as children. Well, it
wasn't the first Batman movie we saw. We grew up

90
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:53,220
with the 89 Batman film on VHS. So comparing it to
not only that, but also Batman Returns and Batman

91
00:08:53,220 --> 00:09:00,400
Forever. It was easy to see that this was just so
different and just weird that. Yeah, it was it was

92
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,080
easy to not appreciate it. I think for people our
age. Yeah, it was when the critic version of

93
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:13,500
Jonathan first manifested at 11 years old.
Another cod piece, one star. Thanks for the

94
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:20,160
answer, Alex. But the winner of this week's No
Prize is Kev, who I think might be Kevin Odleon, a

95
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,940
longtime listener, but I'm not quite sure. I could
be wrong. But he said, hey, what's up, guys? This is

96
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:34,840
Kev. The review that I enjoyed the most from you all
was the Infinity War review. That's actually how I

97
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:40,640
found you guys. I was looking for a review on a movie
and I found you out. And that led me to listen to more

98
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:48,900
of your backlog. And yeah. Yeah, I think Infinity
War and Endgame really expanded the fan base a lot.

99
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:54,520
It was just such a great period of excitement to be a
Marvel Studios fan around that time that people

100
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,940
were just craving that content. I think we saw
pretty good growth in our listenership when those

101
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:03,280
two films came out because they were fucking
fantastic movies. We gave both of them five stars

102
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:09,840
and it was a lot of fun to just basically just gush
all over the movie in our review of it. Ew, you liked

103
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:14,960
the movies, too. I distinctly remember walking
out of the theater and like going up to Jonathan and

104
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,740
being like, I think that's our first five star
review. And he was like, damn it, you're right. I

105
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,940
don't think it was our first five star review, but I
do remember being like, yeah, this is like the

106
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:29,760
Empire Strikes Back of superhero films. We have to
give it five stars. Was the Dark Knight our first

107
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,660
five star review? Yeah, I think so. That sounds
about right. I'm not surprised that Infinity War

108
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:40,200
or Endgame was an answer for this week's question
of the week. I am surprised that no one called in

109
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,000
with the Joker review, though, because if I'm not
mistaken, that is our most listened to episode of

110
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,900
all time. Surprisingly, I think it's a toss up
between our Joker review and our Avengers Endgame

111
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:57,980
review, but that's only for Apple podcasts.
Honestly, I think your Joker review just confused

112
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,760
a lot of people because everybody was like, oh,
this movie is amazing. And you came out like, oh,

113
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:11,080
this movie made me uncomfortable. It did. It did.
How could it not? That was a fun one, though. That

114
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:16,240
was a fun episode for sure. So congrats to Kev for
winning this week's snow prize. In fact, that was

115
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,640
the very last snow prize that we'll be handing out
because for our last few episodes, we're really

116
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:27,900
hoping that you guys call in and give us a farewell
message that will air on our final episode. Just

117
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:32,180
let us know how long you've been listening. You
know, if you have a favorite episode or moment from

118
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:37,380
the show or anything else that you want to share
about dynamic duel and what it meant to you. And

119
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,020
unlike the question of the week answers, we're not
giving you 30 seconds to do it. We're giving you two

120
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:46,260
whole minutes. And don't forget to leave your name
when you call in by clicking on the red microphone

121
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,500
button in the bottom right hand corner of the
screen at dynamic duel.com. That'll prompt you to

122
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:56,940
leave us a voicemail. Again, your message could be
up to two minutes long, and we will play your

123
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:08,980
voicemail on our final episode. But now that
that's done on to the news. OK, last week, Netflix

124
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:14,760
announced its intention to acquire Warner
Brothers in a deal that was valued at

125
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:21,020
approximately eighty seven billion dollars,
making it the largest studio acquisition of all

126
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:27,960
time. Like Disney didn't pay that much for Fox. So
that's kind of cool in a way. Netflix, of course,

127
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:34,040
bid out Comcast and Paramount, who had also
expressed interest in acquiring Warner

128
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:39,500
Brothers, but they just couldn't match the number
that Netflix did. The deal, of course, is not

129
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:47,060
finalized, and it's going to require at least a
year of not only regulatory review, but also the

130
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:53,680
division of Warner Brothers Studios from
discoveries, televised content. But basically,

131
00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,900
what Netflix wants to do is absorb Warner Brothers
film and television library, their major

132
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:08,000
franchises and production capabilities into its
streaming ecosystem. Early reporting is

133
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,640
indicating that Netflix is primarily
interested, of course, in Warner Brothers IP

134
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:18,740
assets and content pipeline, rather than its
physical operations, including DC Comics and its

135
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:24,900
publishing divisions or ancillary business
units. I don't think there's any doubt as to how

136
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:30,060
that would radically reshape Hollywood's and the
comic industry's landscape, because Netflix

137
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:36,180
will be consolidating one of the oldest studios
under what is currently the world's dominant

138
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,880
streaming platform, which, of course, will raise
significant questions about the future of

139
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,580
theatrical releases, legacy media operations
and divisions like DC Comics and Warner Brothers

140
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:54,540
Games. Now, I think it's been reported recently
that Netflix is, in fact, interested in including

141
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,360
Warner Brothers Games as part of its
acquisitions. But there's been little to no word

142
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:06,540
about DC Comics. And I'm not going to lie, it has me
really freaked out and pretty depressed. It's a

143
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,300
fortunate timing that we're ending this podcast
in a matter of weeks, because it seems like this is

144
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:19,800
the end of DC Comics in general. Like Marvel just
won, right, Jonathan? I mean, it kind of feels that

145
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:26,500
way. I'm not going to lie, because Netflix only
wants the DC intellectual property. It's

146
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:32,220
characters and its stories, not the comics
themselves, not the creators and not the legacy.

147
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:39,700
Because Netflix is a industry disruptor, who's
openly signaled that they don't want the whole

148
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:45,380
Warner Brothers machine, including the loss
making divisions that don't fit their business

149
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:50,080
model and would be left on the transactional
floor. Like Paramount was the only company that

150
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:55,600
was actually interested in acquiring all of
Warner Brothers assets. Can you explain what

151
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,900
Netflix's business model is as you understand it
and why that would not include DC Comics? So

152
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:07,460
Netflix is a content algorithm, not a creative
studio. And print comics wouldn't really survive

153
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:15,560
in that business model. You know where Hollywood
has artistic gatekeeping? Netflix just dumps

154
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:22,060
content to keep subscribers engaged. Things like
quality, tradition and legacy don't matter when

155
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:28,800
the only metric is subscriber retention. So
monthly comics, a niche, expensive medium would

156
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:35,040
have no place in that system. Right. There's no way
to put physical print comic books onto the Netflix

157
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,900
digital platform. I guess there is in the form of
digital comic books, but it's not clear at this

158
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,480
time as to whether or not Netflix would be
interested in actually putting digital comics on

159
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:51,400
their streamer. They might. And that's the only
way I think DC Comics survives in the medium of

160
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:58,400
comics, whether that's digital or print. I could
totally see Netflix wanting to put new kinds of

161
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:03,380
digital content on their platform just to keep
people subscribed or maybe even acquire

162
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:10,780
subscribers at a higher rate if they're offering
things like books or podcasts, maybe. But comic

163
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:19,600
books are such a small industry like DC Comics is
only a tiny fraction of Warner Brothers revenue.

164
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:25,000
It may even be a money loser if you look at the
purchasing transfer comics within the past 20, 30

165
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:32,300
years. And Netflix is not going to subsidize a
dying medium. Warner Brothers kept comics alive

166
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:38,840
to cultivate IP, but Netflix doesn't really need
that. They have cheaper R &D through algorithmic

167
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:47,260
data. And now AI comics have shrinking
readership, shrinking orders, high costs. And

168
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,260
I'm pretty sure Netflix's lawyers and
accountants when they're finalizing this deal

169
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:55,300
are just going to elect that and be like,
absolutely not. That's my theory. In what

170
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:01,720
scenarios do you see DC Comic Book surviving as a
print medium if this deal goes through? I think

171
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:08,040
superheroes like Batman and Superman will thrive
in streaming and animation. But like paper

172
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:14,140
comics, they're probably gone. Netflix, I
imagine, would have no motive to maintain

173
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:19,980
physical publishing. And digital only AI
assisted comics are going to be far cheaper and

174
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:27,880
easier to produce. So I think the DC stories will
continue, but printed DC Comics likely won't.

175
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:33,380
Unless, of course, Netflix does what they
currently do with Miller World Comics, which they

176
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:39,400
currently own, and that's license those
characters to currently Dark Horse Comics.

177
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:45,280
Previously, it was Image. That's right. Netflix
licenses the Miller World Comic Books to Dark

178
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:50,540
Horse, who then produces and then publishes those
comic books. Right. But it's not exactly like

179
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:57,360
Miller World is thriving under Netflix. Like Mark
Miller still has to go to Kickstarter to get his

180
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,400
comics funded. And the projects that actually
turned into shows for Netflix, like Jupiter's

181
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:10,100
Legacy, like Super Crooks, they only lasted one
season. So that's terrifying. What do you think is

182
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:15,680
the likelihood that Netflix will actually
license the DC characters to Marvel publishing?

183
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:25,660
Oh, fuck off. Fuck you. Who knows? That may be what
they end up doing, which would freaking kill me.

184
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:30,780
And I think all DC fans, who knows, maybe this means
that these crossover comics that we've been

185
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:35,800
getting between both publishers would be a more
regular occurrence. But there's no denying at

186
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:41,080
that point that Marvel will have, indeed, won the
comic book wars. And you have to admit that I will

187
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:46,240
admit nothing until the steal goes through and we
see what happens. Because right now this is still a

188
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,300
long way off and it may not even go through. There is
a lot of politicians, a lot of industry people who

189
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:57,560
are disparaging this acquisition. So that's
good. I hope it doesn't go through. I was much more

190
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:03,200
hoping that Comcast or Paramount would get Warner
Brothers because legacy means nothing to

191
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:09,460
Netflix. They don't care about fans. They care
about subscribers. And I think even if you are a fan

192
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:17,660
of DC Comics with high hopes for printed comics to
continue, that sentiment is not going to save DC

193
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:23,860
Comics. We've seen beloved institutions
collapse like Wizard Magazine, newspapers.

194
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:29,820
Marvel Comics almost died before being acquired
by Disney. And believing DC Comics will survive

195
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:38,820
forever ignores business reality. Netflix is
ruthless and unsentimental and laser focused on

196
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:45,800
what drives subscriptions. Print Comics are not a
part of that future. I hope I'm wrong, but I'm

197
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,420
afraid I'm not. Print Comics notwithstanding, I
guess there still is potential for Netflix to

198
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:57,420
produce some amazing television and film based
off of the DC intellectual property. Like we've

199
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:04,320
seen them produce Sandman, which you've rated
five stars. Very true. Very true. It may just be

200
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,220
that the primary medium for these characters is no
longer comics, but their stories are told through

201
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:16,280
television series or films, which would be pretty
cool. I will always miss the comics if, in fact,

202
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,420
they do go away. But what's interesting to me,
though, is that Netflix really doesn't have

203
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:26,860
experience with a cinematic universe. You know,
they have seasons of television. Like I'm not

204
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:31,320
familiar with any spinoff shows from Netflix. I
could be wrong. Do you think James Gunn will want to

205
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:37,480
work for Netflix? He may get a few projects funded
through them. But ultimately, I know a lot of

206
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,780
creators have come out against Netflix because
they don't get paid residuals, because

207
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:48,140
ultimately that content ends up on a streaming
platform forever with little to no viewership

208
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:54,300
data, or at least a data that's only proprietary to
Netflix. A lot of people don't get to see that. So I

209
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,820
know a lot of guilds will probably be upset by that,
and they'll probably fight against this. If this

210
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:07,480
deal does not go through, I'm really hoping that
either Paramount or Universal follow up with

211
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:12,340
another bid. But that may not happen because the
rumors are currently that Paramount is

212
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:18,440
interested in now acquiring Universal, so
they'll have no need for Warner Brothers. How did

213
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:24,320
we get here, man? How did DC Comics get here? Like,
what has it been like to be a DC fan throughout the

214
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:31,180
course of these past 10 years? Man, so when this
podcast first started, Time owned Warner

215
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,860
Brothers, like Time Magazine, the publishing
division. So they actually cared about creating

216
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:43,400
print published works like DC Comics. When AT &T
bought them in order to promote their internet

217
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,940
service, they really didn't know what they were
getting into. And that showed with all of the

218
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:53,740
mistakes that they made in handling the Hollywood
studio. They sort of offloaded it onto David

219
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:59,420
Zaslaw, who promised that he could flip the
studio. And I was hoping it was going to be to

220
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:05,440
Universal because he used to work for them. And now
that it's going to be Netflix, it just feels like so

221
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:12,080
many things are going to change. And I hate change.
This sucks. Ultimately, I blame the tech industry

222
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,920
because that's what I see Netflix ultimately as.
It's a tech giant in the same way that Amazon and

223
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:24,020
Apple are. And they're also getting into the
Hollywood game. It's just a weird time for movies,

224
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:29,940
for sure. And since Warner Brothers owns DC Comics
in the same way that Disney owns Marvel Comics,

225
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:35,660
it's affecting that industry as well, which damn
it. Jonathan, what do you say to people that think

226
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:40,220
you're being doom and gloom about this? Are they
right? Are you a little bit biased here? Or are you

227
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:47,660
being a realist? I've always been biased for DC. I
mean, it's not like I want this to happen. It's just

228
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:53,860
somewhat predictable, knowing Netflix. Now, it
could be surprised. Netflix's acquisition of

229
00:22:53,860 --> 00:23:00,820
Warner Brothers may not be the death knell of DC
Comics. I actually hope it isn't, but only time

230
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:07,340
will tell. And I don't think Netflix has really
given us any reason to not be skeptical about what

231
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:12,620
this acquisition means for the publisher. Well,
we'll see how your conjecture pans out in, you

232
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:18,220
know, a couple of years time. We'll report back at
that time. No, we won't. This podcast will be over,

233
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:24,400
but we'll see how it goes. I wish this happened
after the podcast was over. So you wouldn't have to

234
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:38,180
talk about it at all. Yeah, this sucks. This sucks
big time. It literally keeps me up at night. Like we

235
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:43,900
said earlier, there's no question of the week for
this news item. Thank goodness. So let's go ahead

236
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:49,760
and move on to the main event. We'll find out who is
going to win between the Justice League, Detroit

237
00:23:49,760 --> 00:24:11,360
member Gypsy and the X-Men member Shadowcat. All
right, Gypsy versus Shadowcats. These are two

238
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:17,200
young female characters that are a part of larger
teams. Gypsy being a part of the Justice League,

239
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:24,280
Detroit era and Shadowcat Kitty Pryde being a part
of the X-Men. The characters have similar power

240
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:30,700
sets in that they're all about evasion, I guess you
could say. Yeah, Shadowcat can render herself

241
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:36,060
intangible in order to phase through solid
matter, making her extremely difficult to hit.

242
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:41,680
And Gypsy creates mental illusions or something
like that. Well, specifically to turn herself

243
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:47,560
invisible. She creates illusions that surround
her so that she can't be seen by human senses, by

244
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:54,820
electronics, by telepaths, anybody. What kind of
offensive ability is that? Does she create these

245
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:59,580
mental illusions in the same way that like
Mastermind does in the X-Men books? Well, I would

246
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:05,520
say they're as large scale as Masterminds because
Masterminds could immerse someone completely in

247
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:12,240
an illusion. Whereas Gypsy really just covers
herself, though later on in the comics she was able

248
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,260
to envelop like a vehicle that she was in as well or
people surrounding her. So how is being really

249
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:23,440
good at hide and seek a superpower? I feel like I
could not fight crime with that ability. Well,

250
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,980
you're going to learn later on what I break down the
character just exactly how she uses this ability

251
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:33,540
offensively. Yeah, I'm curious. I think a lot more
people are familiar with Kitty Pryde, Shadowcat.

252
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:40,300
She was in the first three X-Men films as well as
X-Men Days of Future Past. She was played by Elliot

253
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:47,840
Page for X-Men 3 and also in Days of Future Past. And
Gypsy has been in nothing. I don't even think she's

254
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,800
been in any of the cartoons. No, she's been in the
cartoons and she was also a love interest of sorts

255
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:59,480
for Cisco Ramon vibe in the Flash television
series. You don't know shit. Apparently I don't.

256
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,800
Well, at least you admit it. Now, to explain the
methodology behind our duels, let's go to our

257
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:09,800
sentient dual simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000.
AJ9K tell our listeners how you go about

258
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:16,060
determining a winner in our dual matchups. Yes, of
course, sir. The way I determine a winner between

259
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:20,320
the contestants is by running one thousand Monte
Carlo simulations using the characters

260
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,240
statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation is a
probabilistic model used to determine outcomes

261
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,960
through random sampling. In this case, I
randomize the statistics along a normal

262
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,840
distribution as a way to simulate the many
variables that can occur during battle. The stat

263
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,960
parameters are based on the official Marvel power
grid from which the DC characters statistics are

264
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,400
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are
included such as range, damage potential,

265
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,500
versatility and perception in order to create a
more detailed and accurate simulation. The

266
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:55,220
results of the one thousand simulations provide a
percentage of wins for each character. The

267
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:59,020
contestant with the higher percentage is
declared the victor as they have a higher

268
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:04,080
probability to win any given battle. In an
equitable pairing, neither character should win

269
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,140
100 percent of the matches. The comic book stories
have shown that there's even a way for Batman to

270
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:13,760
defeat Superman. So the confidence rate of my
method falls in line with the precedents that have

271
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,740
been established in the source material. My
mathematical simulations are without

272
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:23,300
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole
consideration, nor a fan vote is tabulated for

273
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:29,060
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K.
Before we run the simulations, though, we like to

274
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:34,240
break down each character's histories and
abilities before improvising a scenario on how we

275
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,800
imagine one of the one thousand simulations would
play out beat for beat. And it's my turn to go first

276
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:47,280
with the DC characters backstory. So let me tell
you all about Gypsy. Cynthia Cindy Reynolds was

277
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:53,720
born to Edward and June Reynolds in a quiet
Midwestern suburb. For several years, her family

278
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:59,380
life was stable, though after her younger brother
was born, arguments arose between her parents

279
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:05,180
escalating into a pattern of shouting,
resentment, neglect, and eventually physical

280
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:11,100
abuse against Cindy. During this period of
stress, her metahuman abilities surfaced,

281
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:16,740
telepathically rooted illusions that bent
perception, allowing her to blend perfectly into

282
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:23,460
her surroundings, shift her appearance or
obscure her presence entirely. By age 14, Cindy

283
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:30,500
decided to run away, buying a one-way ticket to
Detroit. Alone in the inner city, Cindy used her

284
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,960
powers for basic survival, slipping unseen
through alleyways and storefronts, hiding from

285
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:42,100
threats and stealing food when necessary. Word
spread of a barefoot Bohemian girl who could

286
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:48,300
vanish into the walls, and Cindy gradually
adopted the street identity of Gypsy. Cameron

287
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:53,120
Street became her informal territory, where she
learned to refine her abilities through constant

288
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,660
exposure to danger and remained hidden from both
criminals and authorities. When the Justice

289
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:04,600
League relocated to Detroit following the
dissolution of the prior team, Gypsy infiltrated

290
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:10,020
their new headquarters repeatedly, testing its
defenses and slipping past visual detection,

291
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,740
electronic systems, and even Martian
Manhunter's telepathy. Her existence became

292
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:20,100
undeniable only when she intervened during the
league's confrontation with the Obermaster and

293
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:25,200
his cadre. With her help, Obermaster was
defeated, prompting the league to offer her

294
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,540
official membership. You can learn more about the
Justice League in our Justice League vs. Avengers

295
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:37,360
Team Duel episode. Gypsy trained alongside
Steel, Vibe, Vixen, Zatanna, and Martian

296
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:43,660
Manhunter as part of the Detroit League's roster.
She refined her agility, acrobatics, and combat

297
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:49,000
skills, and grew more confident in using her
illusion casting offensively. During a

298
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,740
wilderness retreat intended to build teamwork,
the royal flesh gang ambushed the league. While

299
00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:30,400
hiding, Gypsy was able to use her telepathy to
project an astral form to track down the league.

300
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:37,240
Before disappearing, emotionally devastated,
Gypsy attempted reconciliation with her family.

301
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,020
Eventually, the telepathed Disparo, who was
hunting Justice League members, located Gypsy

302
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:48,780
and murdered her parents. He would have killed her
as well, if not for the intervention of Martian

303
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:54,380
Manhunter, who arrived in time to drive Disparo
off. You can learn more about Disparo and Martian

304
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:59,580
Manhunter in their duels against the high
evolutionary and vision, respectively. With her

305
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:05,160
family gone, Gypsy accepted Boostergold's
recruitment into the conglomerate, a corporate

306
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:10,500
sponsored hero team. Though she contributed
significantly to their missions, the emotional

307
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,800
aftermath of her parents' deaths eventually
pushed her to leave the group. Gypsy later joined

308
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:20,100
the Justice League Task Force, where she
developed a close partnership with Martian

309
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:24,940
Manhunter. They worked together on missions
requiring infiltration, psychological

310
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:31,120
disruption, or precision stealth. Early in her
Task Force career, Gypsy was nearly forced into

311
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,760
combat with Lady Shiva during a tense operation,
but avoided the confrontation. On another

312
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,680
mission, she suffered catastrophic injuries and
was believed dead, though Martian Manhunter

313
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:47,860
invoked Khran Mir. The Martian got a fire and a
transformation, successfully restoring Gypsy

314
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:54,160
to life. As the Task Force restructured, Gypsy
remained a central member, undertaking covert

315
00:31:54,160 --> 00:32:00,220
operations across multiple countries, until the
team eventually disbanded. Gypsy continued

316
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:05,300
working intermittently with Martian Manhunter
and assisted the Justice League during major

317
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:10,740
supernatural or large-scale threats, even
participating in operations supporting Wonder

318
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:16,780
Woman in battles against Cersei and her forces.
After being recruited by Barbara Gordon, Gypsy

319
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:23,240
next joined the Birds of Prey, which you can learn
more about in their duel against A-Force. Oracle

320
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:30,040
relied on her as an invisible operative capable of
infiltrating spaces unseen by cameras, guards,

321
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:36,400
or enhanced senses. Gypsy's powers had grown to
allow her to extend illusions across wide areas,

322
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:42,260
cloaking entire rooms, vehicles, or strike
teams. During this period, she partnered with

323
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:48,180
Vixen to resolve a long-running case involving
Amos Fortune and helped rescue Stargirl when

324
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:54,680
Fortune targeted Justice Society members. Gypsy
was later abducted by the Clock King and forced to

325
00:32:54,680 --> 00:33:00,360
fight in the Dark Side Club's Gladiator Arena,
where she was defeated early in the tournament, be

326
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,900
freed once the arena was later dismantled. In
post-Flashpoint continuity, a new Gypsy

327
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:12,080
emerged, named Cynthia Mordeth, the daughter of
Quell Mordeth, who ruled an extra-dimensional

328
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:18,500
realm inhabited by nomadic travelers who moved
between dimensions and absorbed multiversal

329
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:24,660
energy. As Quell Mordeth's heir, Cynthia
possessed innate illusion-casting powers,

330
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:30,040
augmented by her ability to store and channel
dimensional energy. Rejecting her father's

331
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:35,480
oppressive role, Cynthia attempted to flee her
native dimension, but became separated from her

332
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:41,420
traveling family during a transit jump. She
emerged alone on Earth, where Argus agents

333
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:46,940
intercepted her. Mistaking her arrival for a
precursor to invasion, they imprisoned her in a

334
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:53,080
secure vault. She remained confined until
rupture. Another traveler from her dimension and

335
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:58,660
the brother of Cisco Ramone arrived on Earth. His
incursion broke her containment, drawing

336
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:04,500
Cynthia into conflict with her father's forces,
operating covertly across dimensions. You can

337
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:10,480
learn more about Cisco in our Vibe vs Miss America
dual episode. Because this new Gypsy's powers

338
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,520
incorporated both magical and
extra-dimensional aspects, she could absorb and

339
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:21,560
redirect dimensional energy to enhance her
abilities or shield herself. She participated in

340
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:26,620
several encounters involving Argus, rupture,
and breaches between dimensions tied to her

341
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:31,860
father's influence. When the defeat of the
multiversal threat from the Batman who laughs led

342
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:37,580
to the restructuring of the multiverse, the
original Gypsy, Cindy Reynolds, was restored to

343
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:43,659
continuity. And that's her history so far.
Powers-wise, Gypsy casts illusions that bend

344
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:49,199
perception, allowing her to render herself
invisible against shifting backgrounds or

345
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:54,580
project fear-based hallucinations into
opponents' minds. She can disguise herself as

346
00:34:54,580 --> 00:35:00,840
individuals of similar size and can extend her
cloaking to nearby allies, objects, or even

347
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:06,960
moving vehicles. She possesses limited
precognition and can project an astral form to

348
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:14,450
observe from afar, and is a trained combatant,
acrobat, and stealth operative. That's Gypsy.

349
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:21,260
Okay, so she's less offensive and more of like a
spy. She's like the ultimate spy. Yeah, you could

350
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:26,400
say that. There was a time when she was a member of
Justice League Task Force, where she wore like

351
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,180
Romani armor and carried a scimitar, but it was
very short-lived. Actually, there was a time when

352
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:38,560
Shadowcat carried a Katana sword because she's
trained in Kenjutsu. Or I guess it's not a Katana

353
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:43,700
because that was a samurai weapon. It was like a
Ninjado or something. Interesting. Okay.

354
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:48,960
Depending on how offensive Gypsy was, I was
thinking about bringing Lockheed into this match

355
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:54,140
largely because he almost always accompanies
Kitty Pride. I'm sorry, did you let me have Skeets

356
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:59,900
in the booster gold duel? I mean, there's nothing
that Skeets could do that booster gold couldn't.

357
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,540
Okay, if you're including Lockheed, how are we
going to account for him in the stats though? By

358
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:13,700
giving Kitty Pride an extra range boost. Okay.
Yeah. Fuck off. You don't get him. Fine. All right,

359
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:19,320
all right. But if I lose, I'm blaming you. I'm
totally okay with that. Blame me for all of your

360
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:23,140
losses. You know, Kitty Pride's gonna be able to
hold her own though. Let me go ahead and get into her

361
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:30,060
backstory. Catherine Kitty Pride was born in
Deerfield, Illinois, where at age 13, her

362
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:35,580
emerging mutant power caused intense headaches.
However, she developed the ability to become

363
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:42,280
intangible and pass through solid matter called
phasing. Both Professor Charles Xavier and Emma

364
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,300
Frost sought to recruit her to their respective
schools. Though their meeting was cut short when

365
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:52,560
Frost's armored mercenaries attacked, forcing
Kitty to evade capture and contact the X-Men.

366
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,500
Phoenix then altered Kitty's parents' memories
so they would allow her to enroll at Xavier school.

367
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:04,890
Kitty became the youngest X-Men and took the code
name Sprite, forming close ties with Storm,

368
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:10,560
Wolverine, Nightcrawler, and Colossus, while
also befriending Magic. You can learn more about

369
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,450
the X-Men in their duel against the Titans. Early
in Kitty's time with the X-Men, her older self from

370
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:22,240
an alternate future briefly possessed her body to
prevent the assassination of an anti-muteant

371
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,500
politician named Senator Robert Kelly, whose
death would have led to a post-apocalyptic

372
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:32,930
timeline called the Days of Future Past. Kitty
went on to defeat Ingari demons, get abducted by

373
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:38,720
the mutant Caliban, and narrowly survive a
confrontation with Magneto that forced him to

374
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:44,200
reconsider his increasingly violent methods.
Kitty's parents later transferred her to Emma

375
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:49,980
Frost's Massachusetts Academy, where she became
embroiled in Emma's attempt to infiltrate the

376
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:55,580
X-Men before ultimately returning to Xavier
school. You can learn more about Emma Frost in our

377
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:01,700
Poison Ivy vs White Queen duel episode. During the
X-Men's imprisonment by the parasitic alien race

378
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:07,340
known as the Brood, Kitty encountered the small
alien dragon Lockheed who followed her to Earth

379
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:13,680
and became her loyal companion. Xavier attempted
to place Kitty with the new mutants team, but after

380
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,140
she fought off an alien threat with Lockheed's
help, he reinstated her as an X-Man. You can learn

381
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:24,460
more about the new mutants in their duel against
the Legion of Superheroes. Kitty and Colossus

382
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:29,080
developed a tentative romance, but their
relationship ended when Colossus admitted he had

383
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:34,350
fallen in love with another woman. Kitty then
found comfort in her friendship with Cypher,

384
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:39,620
though they never pursued a relationship.
Visiting her father in Japan led to Kitty's

385
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:44,600
capture by Ogan, who is Wolverine's former
martial arts master and whose psychic

386
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:50,080
conditioning forced her to believe she was his
ninja apprentice. After Wolverine helped her

387
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:55,520
break Ogan's influence through harsh training,
Kitty defeated Ogan alongside Wolverine and

388
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:01,780
returned to the X-Men, adopting the new code name
Shadowcat. During the Marauder's massacre of a

389
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:07,060
group of underground mutants known as Morlocks,
Kitty was struck by an energy weapon that left her

390
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:13,440
unable to regain full solidity. A joint effort by
the Fantastic Four and Dr. Doom restored Kitty to

391
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,200
stability, though she needed concentration to
remain tangible. While recovering, she and

392
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,020
Nightcrawler saw televised footage of the X-Men
apparently sacrificing themselves in a battle

393
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:29,400
with the demon known as the adversary, prompting
Kitty and Nightcrawler to help form the team

394
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:34,800
Excalibur in London alongside Captain Britain.
You can learn more about Captain Britain in his

395
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,780
duel against Uncle Sam. With Excalibur, Kitty
fought Mojo's war wolves, helped rescue Rachel

396
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:46,080
Summers, and entered a relationship with her
teammate Pete Wisdom. Kitty was later recruited

397
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,820
by the International Intelligence
Organization's Shield to repair the

398
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:54,600
Helicarrier's malfunctioning computers.
There, she discovered that Ogan's spirit had

399
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:59,890
infiltrated the system, which she purged with
Wolverine's help. Tensions eventually ended her

400
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:04,660
relationship with Pete Wisdom, and after
Excalibur disbanded, Kitty returned to the

401
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:10,260
X-Men, who had returned. A visit to the mutant
nation of Genotian profoundly affected Kitty,

402
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:15,740
and after Colossus seemingly died curing the
Legacy Virus, she saw a normal life studying at the

403
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:20,780
University of Chicago. She became involved in
conflicts with anti-mutant groups such as

404
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:26,620
Purity, and helped repel a new wave of sentinels
led by Nimrod, whom you can learn more about in our

405
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:32,850
Amazo vs. Bastion duel. Kitty later joined
Storm's Extreme X-Men squad, and confronted

406
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:37,680
threats including William Striker and Lord
Imperial, before accepting Cyclops's

407
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:43,100
invitation to rejoin the main X-Men team at the
Xavier Institute despite her uneasiness toward

408
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:49,280
Emerfrost. On one of her first missions back,
Kitty discovered that Colossus was alive, having

409
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:55,320
been experimented on after his apparent death by
an alien from Breakworld. The two reconciled and

410
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:00,760
resumed their relationship. Later, Professor
X's twin Cassandra Nova manipulated Kitty's

411
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:06,040
mind, making her believe she had a child who had
been taken captive, causing Kitty to free

412
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:10,440
Cassandra Nova's consciousness from
imprisonment. Afterward, the X-Men were

413
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:16,300
abducted by the extraterrestrial intelligence
agency, Sword, and they were taken to Breakworld.

414
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:23,080
There, Kitty phased into a massive bullet that was
fired at Earth, and unable to escape it, she phased

415
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:28,500
the whole bullet through the planet, saving
Earth, but remained stuck inside it as it hurtled

416
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:34,060
through space. Magneto later tracked and
redirected the bullet, pulling Kitty safely back

417
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:39,080
to Earth, though she remained stuck in an
intangible, speechless state. She was later

418
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:45,390
fully restored after a Breakworld alien ritual
revived her and stabilized her powers. Kitty then

419
00:41:45,390 --> 00:41:51,360
accompanied Colossus and Magic to the Crimson
Cosmos, where Colossus became Sidorok's new

420
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,200
juggernaut, prompting Kitty to end their
rekindled relationship. You can learn more about

421
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:01,740
this in our Metal Man vs Colossus Duel. When
Wolverine founded a new mutant school in

422
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:08,320
opposition to Cyclops's militarization of the
X-Men, Kitty joined him as Headmistress. There,

423
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:13,890
she endured a brood infestation that masqueraded
as a sudden pregnancy, but she was able to remove

424
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:18,960
the alien parasite. She later mentored the
time-displaced original X-Men brought to the

425
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,540
present by Beast, but disagreements over how the
teenagers should be handled led Kitty to leave

426
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:30,260
Wolverine school and join Cyclops's Renegade
team, where she worked closely with the young Jean

427
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:36,240
Grey. During Jean's kidnapping by the Shiar Alien
race, Kitty collaborated with the Guardians of

428
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:42,780
the Galaxy, beginning a romance with Peter Quill,
aka Star-Lord. Kitty traveled to space and

429
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:49,160
rescued Quill from the Slaughter Lords, helping
steal a cosmic artifact known as the Black Vortex.

430
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:54,780
After the artifact changed hands repeatedly,
Kitty submitted to its power so she could phase the

431
00:42:54,780 --> 00:43:00,700
entire planet's Spartax and its population from
captivity. Star-Lord proposed to Kitty

432
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:06,180
afterward, and she accepted. As Quill became the
King of Spartax, Kitty struggled with his growing

433
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:11,350
responsibilities and eventually took on the
mantle of Star-Lord herself. Their relationship

434
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:16,040
deteriorated until both were captured by the
Collector and forced to confront their

435
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,320
unresolved conflict, reconciling before
returning to the Guardians. Kitty later fought

436
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:27,390
the Kree accuser Hala, liberated prisoners on a
Pudun world, and assisted Earth's heroes during a

437
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:32,700
conflict between Iron Man and Captain Marvel,
before choosing to separate from Quill and leave

438
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:38,140
the Guardians of the Galaxy. You can learn more
about that team in their duel against Doom Patrol.

439
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:43,680
Back on Earth, Kitty settled briefly in Chicago
before Storm convinced her to rejoin the X-Men as

440
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,840
their leader. She moved the mansion to Central
Park, oversaw a restructured team, and rekindled

441
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:55,640
her relationship with Colossus, ultimately
proposing to him. However, Kitty left Colossus at

442
00:43:55,640 --> 00:44:01,020
the altar, recognizing their volatile history
was not a foundation for marriage. When the mutant

443
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:07,120
nation of Kakao formed, Kitty discovered she
alone could not use its organic gateways.

444
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:13,460
Displaced from mutant society, she adopted the
name Kate and accepted Emma Frost's offer to serve

445
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:19,180
as the Red Queen of the Hellfire Trading Company,
taking to the high seas and leading the Marauders

446
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:24,580
to liberate mutants worldwide. Sebastian Shaw,
former leader of the Hellfire Club, was

447
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:29,620
threatened by Kate's influence and arranged to
have her drowned. Resurrection through Kakao

448
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:35,120
proved unusually difficult in Kate's case, but
with Emma's intervention, she returned, helped

449
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:41,040
defeat and politically neutralize Shaw, and
continued defending mutants. You can learn more

450
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,860
about Sebastian Shaw in his duel against Vandal
Savage. During a catastrophic attack on Kakao,

451
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:52,840
the anti-muent organization Orgis sabotaged the
island's systems and forced Professor Xavier to

452
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:57,980
evacuate mutants through the Kakao gateways,
only for the population to vanish to a pocket

453
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:04,160
reality due to Orgis' interference. Kate managed
to avoid capture and rebranded herself as

454
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:10,300
Shadowcat, Cat with a K. She conducted lethal
covert operations against Orgis, later joining a

455
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:16,180
small strike team that continued resisting until
Orgis' eventual defeat. With the conflict over,

456
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:20,940
she returned to Chicago, where a young mutant
inspired her to re-embrace her cheerful nature

457
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:28,800
and go back to her nickname Kitty instead of Kate.
Powers-wise, Shadowcat, with a K, has the ability

458
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,340
to phase through matter by rendering herself or
any part of herself intangible. She can extend

459
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:39,400
this intangibility to anyone or anything in her
immediate proximity, allowing whatever she

460
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:45,600
touches to phase as well. While phased inside
solid matter, she is decoupled from gravity and

461
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:51,700
inertia, allowing her to sink or rise through the
matter freely. A limitation on her intangibility

462
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:56,560
is that it is harder for her to phase through
extremely dense matter, for example, phasing

463
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:02,300
through adamantium makes her sick. She is also
unable to phase through mystical energies or

464
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:07,840
electromagnetic energy such as radiation,
electricity, or microwaves. However, this

465
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:12,700
allows her to disrupt electronic devices while
phasing through them, as well as a person's

466
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:17,820
nervous system, causing anything from shock to
unconsciousness in her enemies. She can also

467
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:23,460
partially phase, becoming just dense enough to
affect a person's internal states. She can also

468
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:29,240
phase out of sync with Earth's rotation, allowing
her to travel due west at a rate of approximately

469
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:36,220
1000 miles per hour at the equator, down to around
500 miles per hour in the mainland United States.

470
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:47,800
While tangible, her mind is immune to telepathy.
She is also an expert in computer science and a

471
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:53,700
Wait, she is immune to telepathy? When
intangible, yes. I don't know how that is going to

472
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:58,880
affect this particular battle, but I guess we will
play it out and see how that goes. Well, Gypsy is a

473
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,720
telepath, but her power affects all senses, not
just telepathic ones. I mean, she simulates

474
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:10,440
senses through the person's brain through
telepathy, how I figure it works. I don't know how

475
00:47:10,440 --> 00:48:09,700
it works. I don't think it's that though. Okay,
okay. Let's find out. All right, guys, the clock is

476
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:15,840

got their histories and abilities out of the way,

482
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:58,760
let's speculate on how one of the 1000 simulated
matches will go. The winner is determined by

483
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:05,240
simulations, not this speculation, but it's fun
to imagine how this fight could play out. AJ9K,

484
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:11,060
what are the rules of speculation? Well, I should
say there are no rules other than the characters

485
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:16,300
have no prior knowledge of the other going into the
fight. All they are aware of starting out is that

486
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:20,780
the other character is a threat that needs to be
eliminated. For the speculation, the

487
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:26,000
contestants will begin approximately 50 meters
apart in a nondescript environment that will have

488
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,380
no bearing on the match itself, as no
environmental statistics are considered in my

489
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:35,440
simulations. The contestants must earn victory
on their own merit. Alright, then let's get into

490
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:42,460
it. Gypsy and Shadowcat meet on the battlefield.
Who goes first? I say Shadowcat is gonna start

491
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:49,260
first by phasing into the ground beneath her, so
she's intangible. That means Gypsy can't see her

492
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:54,960
and she can't also psychically influence her, so
Gypsy can't do jack shit. Okay, well, what are

493
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:03,160
Shadowcat's senses like underground? Uh, well,
her vision is obscured and her hearing would be

494
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:10,140
dulled, and her smell would also be dulled, and
like she has to hold her breath while phased

495
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:14,600
through solid matter because there's no oxygen
there, and that limits the time that she can spend

496
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:21,360
within solid matter. So not great. We'll say not
great. Alright, I guess I'll just fucking wait for

497
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:26,680
her to come back up to the surface then, because
when she does, she's not gonna see Gypsy anywhere,

498
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:33,460
because Gypsy goes invisible. Well, uh, like
assuming Gypsy didn't move after Shadowcat went

499
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:39,160
underground, Shadowcat leaps from out of the
ground with a ninja kick that busts Gypsy right in

500
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:47,180
the nose, blurring her vision. Ah, damn, sorry.
Gypsy did in fact move because she's not an idiot,

501
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:54,580
so Shadowcat literally kicks air and, you know,
she awkwardly lands. That's when her legs are

502
00:50:54,580 --> 00:51:00,320
gonna get swept out from under her by Gypsy, still
invisible, and Shadowcat is gonna land on her

503
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:06,960
head, knocking her out. Sorry to tell you, only the
soles of Shadowcat's feet were tangible as she

504
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:12,320
landed. The rest of her was intangible, so when
Gypsy tries to sweep the leg, she just gets nothing

505
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:18,960
but air. And after that big ol' whiff, Shadowcat's
able to detect Gypsy's invisible leg going

506
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:25,120
through her, and therefore she's able to
determine her location. So using that, Shadowcat

507
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:30,140
leaps through Gypsy's body, disrupting the
electrical signals in her nervous system, and

508
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:36,520
causing her to become visible, and also barf her
brains out. And like when Gypsy's bent over,

509
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:43,860
puking, Shadowcat just punts her right in the
throat. Dang. Okay, well that will cause puke to

510
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:49,440
spray all over Shadowcat as Gypsy gets knocked
away by the kick. No, no, no, the puke just goes

511
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:56,000
right through Shadowcat, okay? And since Gypsy's
still visible, Shadowcat's gonna follow up with

512
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:02,540
this front flip drop heel kick. It's called a
rolling thunder kick, and that's just gonna knock

513
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:07,900
Gypsy the fuck out. Like, she's gonna be
unconscious after a kick like that. Except that

514
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:13,640
the Gypsy that Shadowcat attacked was an
illusion. The real Gypsy, you know, got her

515
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:20,280
bearings and rolled away to recover while leaving
a decoy projection of herself, so Shadowcat just

516
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:27,540
lands on the ground really hard. And since her body
was fully tangible to lend weight to her attack,

517
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:34,320
Shadowcat receives the full brunt of Gypsy's own
running drop kick right as she lands. No, that foot

518
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:43,140
would just go right through Shadowcat. Fuck you.
No, it doesn't. Okay, let's say Gypsy does land a

519
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:50,300
kick on Shadowcat. Big deal, it's not gonna happen
again. Like, Gypsy would probably try to follow up

520
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:56,380
with another hit, and that one would go right
through Shadowcat. So Gypsy would be thrown off

521
00:52:56,380 --> 00:53:03,820
balance, and that would leave her open for
Shadowcat to again, except this time she takes one

522
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:08,580
of Gypsy's eyeballs with her, just phases it right
out of her skull. Actually, before she could do

523
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:16,840
that, Shadowcat is gonna stop short when she sees
that Gypsy suddenly is like a fucking vampire

524
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:23,880
zombie swamp monster, which is an illusion, of
course, but Shadowcat's gonna get so freaked out

525
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:30,980
by this, so shocked that she's gonna fault her and
become tangible, giving Gypsy just enough time to

526
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:36,940
do like a palm strike right to Shadowcat's solar
plexus. Except the palm goes right through

527
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:45,840
Shadowcat. You bitch. Okay, fine. Gypsy knocks
the wind out of Shadowcat, so Shadowcat's gonna

528
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:50,200
fall over, but she's just gonna fall into the
ground again to recover. And then she's gonna

529
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:56,320
launch out of the ground again with an uppercut
that phases Gypsy's heart right out of her chest.

530
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:02,780
Fatality. Match over, Shadowcat wins. No, no, no,
because Gypsy has limited precognition. That

531
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:09,180
actually helps her perfect her illusion casting
ability in like chaotic environments. So Gypsy

532
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:16,280
saw this coming, and she's just gonna step out of
the way, grab Shadowcat's tangible fist, and just

533
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:21,760
flip her back onto the ground in this really
powerful slam, when strong enough that it

534
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,640
straight up knocks Shadowcat out, giving Gypsy
the win. Now, Shadowcat just phases into the

535
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:36,400
ground again. I will cut you. This, this is exactly
why we waited so long to do a kitty pride duel. Well,

536
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:41,520
maybe instead of phasing into the ground, all of a
sudden Shadowcat phases out of sync with the

537
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:48,860
earth, so that all of a sudden Gypsy gets flung at
like 500 miles per hour due west alongside kitty

538
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:55,100
pride, and like just gets fucking thrown that way.
Did you not hear me say she has precognition? I'm

539
00:54:55,100 --> 00:55:00,800
pretty sure I said that. That's fair. We could go
ahead and leave the duel there. Either Shadowcat

540
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:07,080
takes Gypsy out by phasing her heart out of her
chest, or Gypsy sees this coming and slams her to

541
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:12,380
the ground, knocking Shadowcat unconscious. Not
gonna lie, one of those endings is a lot cooler than

542
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:17,320
the other. We'll go ahead and input their stats,
run the simulations, and come back with a winner. A

543
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:30,120
G9K? Hit it! Alright, this was a very tricky
speculation to do, largely because both of these

544
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:35,840
characters are so defensive within their power
set that we quickly, I feel like, ran out of ideas on

545
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:41,500
how they could attack each other. This is one of the
reasons why you should let me include Lockheed in

546
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:48,920
this duel No, sorry, Lockheed is not Shadowcat.
Shadowcat is Shadowcat. So she was the only one you

547
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:54,100
got in this duel. I do think it would have spiced
things up a little bit because Gypsy and Shadowcat

548
00:55:54,100 --> 00:56:00,220
weren't too impressive statistically when it
came to things like damage level, or strength, or

549
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:08,940
durability. They were hella evasive. Shadowcat
is faster than Gypsy, but only when going due west.

550
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:14,180
We said when they came to fighting skill, they were
even, and also versatility, which is not

551
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:18,800
surprising because they're both kind of
one-trick ponies. I was surprised that Gypsy was

552
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:24,100
as good of a fighter as Shadowcat. Dude, yeah, she
trained under Bronze Tiger. Is that more

553
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:30,080
impressive than training under Wolverine? Hell
yeah, bro. Hell yeah. Now, in addition to speed,

554
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:36,620
Shadowcat also got the edge when it came to
intellect and evasiveness, but only because it's

555
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:41,700
harder to hit someone who's intangible than
someone who's invisible. But Gypsy got the edge

556
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:47,520
when it came to perception, considering she's a
telepath. And she also has limited precognition.

557
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:52,020
And could observe things from afar with her astral
projection, which is why she also got a slight

558
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:58,400
range advantage, also considering that she could
project her illusions to encompass like a room. So

559
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:04,560
taking all of this into consideration, Joseph,
who do you think came out on top in this match?

560
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:09,280
Shadowcat, because I don't care how invisible
Gypsy goes, she's not going to be able to touch

561
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:16,360
Shadowcat. You think so, huh? Yeah. And Instagram
agrees with me. 67%, literally two-thirds of our

562
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:21,520
poll takers have cited with Shadowcat. And I got to
say, it's about damn time that they sided with the

563
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:26,960
Marvel character. And yet we all know this is
because Shadowcat has been in the movies. And the

564
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:32,960
Instagram poll is much more of a popularity
contest, rather than an evaluation of the

565
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,460
character's stats. Yeah, Shadowcat's been
better represented in the media, and is just

566
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:42,080
generally a better character overall, is what
you're saying? Yes. The Instagram poll takers

567
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:50,280
know this. But will that result in a win? Let's find
out. AJ9K, the results, please. Here you are, sir.

568
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:59,700
The winner of the matchup between Gypsy and
Shadowcat is Shadowcat. Of course, I feel like I

569
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:05,020
barely have to celebrate this. It was obvious from
the start. It was not obvious. What are you talking

570
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:11,940
about? I totally thought Gypsy was going to come
ahead in this. Shadowcat won an even 560 out of the

571
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:20,440
1000 matches, or 56% of the time, compared to
Gypsy, who only won 44%. Jonathan, Netflix bought

572
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:27,080
DC and Gypsy lost this dual matchup. What are you
doing next? I'm going to beat your ass is what I'm

573
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:31,860
going to do. Drive over to your house right now,
kicking your door. Thanks for the warning. I will

574
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:38,920
set my alarm. Or I guess it would just make more
sense just to call the cops. They'll be on my side

575
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:45,400
for all the shit talking you do. Well, congrats to
the Marvel fans. You guys did it again. Showed DC

576
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:50,260
what's up. We all know that Marvel's better,
especially nowadays. Cheers to you guys. Well,

577
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:57,180
that does it for this shitty episode. AJ9K help
close us out. Thanks for listening to Dynamic

581
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:19,840
hopefully will be better, I think it will be, it's
going to be another duel this time between the

582
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:26,900
Superman villain Parasite against Sauron of the
Savage Land. Yeah, he's an X-Men villain

583
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:32,680
primarily. He looks like a big green pterodactyl.
So look forward to that next week. We want to give a

584
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:37,220
