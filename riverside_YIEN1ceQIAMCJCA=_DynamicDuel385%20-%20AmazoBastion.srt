This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,142 --> 00:00:28,103
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:28,524 --> 00:00:33,406
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based

4
00:00:33,546 --> 00:00:39,669
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother Johnny DC. And in this episode,

5
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:45,292
we are going to find out who would win in a
fight between the artificial intelligence robot

6
00:00:45,472 --> 00:00:52,355
characters, Amazo and Bastion. Now if you guys
have recently watched X-Men 97, the cartoon

7
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:57,899
on Disney+, you will know who Bastion is, and
if you're not a DC fan, you probably have no

8
00:00:57,959 --> 00:01:04,843
idea who Amazo is. Everyone knows who Amazo
is. Uh huh. Like, everyone. Okay. Both of these

9
00:01:04,863 --> 00:01:08,746
guys are highly adaptable. It's going to be
a really great matchup. We're going to input

10
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:13,368
the character's statistics, run a thousand simulations,
and find out who would actually win, but not

11
00:01:13,388 --> 00:01:17,082
before speculating on the match itself. Before
that, we're going to break down the latest

12
00:01:17,102 --> 00:01:21,024
comic book movie news to come out this past
week, of which we have two news items, the

13
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:27,406
first one being that Nicolas Cage is going to
star in a Spider-Man War live action series

14
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:34,229
for Amazon, and we got a release date for the
movie Supergirl, Woman of Tomorrow. As always,

15
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:38,211

to the no prize. A no prize is an award Marvel

39
00:04:10,898 --> 00:04:16,266
used to give out to fans. Our version, the dynamic
duel no prize. is a digital award we post on

40
00:04:16,386 --> 00:04:21,509
Instagram for the person that we feel gave the
best answer to our question of the week. Last

41
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:26,451
week we asked, which actor wore your favorite
Superman suit and why was it your favorite?

42
00:04:26,511 --> 00:04:30,973
And this was coming off of the first look that
we got at David Cornswett's Superman suit in

43
00:04:30,993 --> 00:04:36,975
the upcoming Superman movie directed by James
Gunn. We got only three answers and two of

44
00:04:36,995 --> 00:04:40,297
them were the same. So really we got two answers,
but let's go ahead and break down those honorable

45
00:04:40,317 --> 00:04:45,418
mentions as well as the no prize winner. Our
first honorable mention goes to Christopher

46
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:51,060
Minotti, who said, Hi guys Christopher Minotti.
My favorite Superman suit has to be the one

47
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:57,302
that was worn by Brandon Ruth in the CW's Crisis
on Infinite Earths. I really like that one.

48
00:04:57,502 --> 00:05:04,364
It's like a combination between the one that
he wore in Superman Returns and the super suit

49
00:05:04,564 --> 00:05:10,865
in Kingdom Come. I love the emblem from that
one and I like how this one looks. It's...

50
00:05:11,286 --> 00:05:17,169
designed very well and I like him as well. Yeah,
it was not a bad costume. I'm a big fan of

51
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:22,752
Kingdom Come, so it was really great to see
that suit in live action. I don't remember

52
00:05:22,792 --> 00:05:27,355
seeing too many elements from the Superman Returns
costume. Actually, I'm not a big fan of that

53
00:05:27,395 --> 00:05:31,998
costume, but I thought it was a really good
adaptation of the Kingdom Come comic, and it

54
00:05:32,018 --> 00:05:36,280
was just really cool to see Brandon Routh as
Superman again. Yeah, with the graying temples

55
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:41,292
and everything in homage to Kingdom Come. That
was pretty cool. Of course, David Cornsweat's

56
00:05:41,552 --> 00:05:47,597
Superman costume has a similar looking S emblem
shield on his chest where it's just like the

57
00:05:48,037 --> 00:05:53,301
diagonal line going across. Right. Except it's
not against a black field. Right, it's yellow

58
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:59,306
for Cornsweat's suit. Great answer, Christopher.
Our next honorable mention goes to Colby Hentges,

59
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:06,052
who said... Hey boys, Colby Hentges. My favorite
Superman suit would have been the Brandon Roth

60
00:06:06,672 --> 00:06:12,080
CW Crisis Kingdom Come Superman suit. It looks
like he just pulled that thing out of an Alex

61
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,983
Ross painting and put it on. Yeah, Alex Ross
is just a really good costume designer. I mean,

62
00:06:18,223 --> 00:06:22,865
Superman suit was cool, but so was like Batman's
and Wonder Woman's and just everybody. And

63
00:06:22,906 --> 00:06:27,648
not just in Kingdom Come, but like across the
board. He has really good like reinterpretations

64
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:33,251
for characters like the Riddler or even like
Clayface. Yeah, he's very much a fan of the

65
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:38,090
Silver Age, but I like his modern adaptations
of the costumes from that time for sure. I'm

66
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:42,171
interested in all the different ways Brandon
Routh's last name can be pronounced. I think

67
00:06:42,191 --> 00:06:48,753
we got Ruth, we got Roth. It's Routh. Honestly,
I'm surprised that these two honorable mentions

68
00:06:48,773 --> 00:06:52,894
were the same answer. I actually thought there
would be a lot more answer submissions for

69
00:06:52,934 --> 00:06:56,815
this particular question. But let's go ahead
and announce the winner of this week's Snow

70
00:06:56,855 --> 00:07:02,376
Prize, who is Miggy Matangian, who said, Hey,
what's up guys, this is Miggy and I'm here

71
00:07:02,416 --> 00:07:07,606
to voice the popular opinion on the server in
case somebody else does. And that is Tyler

72
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:13,330
Hawklund's Superman suit and Superman and Lois,
and I guess the rest of the Arrowverse. It's

73
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:21,136
just very classic looking, great symbol, good
textures, kind of like rebirth suit inspired,

74
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:27,800
but also just very classic. I don't know, like
Silver Age. Yeah, it's a good one. So all TV

75
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,884
answers for this question, I expected at least
one answer from one of the movies. But, you

76
00:07:32,904 --> 00:07:38,696
know, Tyler Hawklund Superman suit is not. terrible.
There's actually a lot of fans of it. I'm not

77
00:07:38,736 --> 00:07:44,602
particularly a fan of Tyler Houghlin as Superman.
In my opinion, he kind of looks like a younger

78
00:07:44,642 --> 00:07:49,667
version of Ty Burrell. But I also can't deny
the fact that his suit is really good. And

79
00:07:49,727 --> 00:07:54,091
I love seeing the different iterations of it
that we've had from across, you know, the various

80
00:07:54,411 --> 00:07:59,496
crisis and else world storylines that we've
seen him in and like his golden age costume.

81
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:04,147
They were all really cool. Actually, this is
my favorite Superman costume as well, Tyler

82
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:10,529
Hocklands, because not only is it a great, like
modern adaptation of the Superman costume,

83
00:08:10,549 --> 00:08:14,611
I think it's better than Henry Cavill's Superman
suit. And I definitely think it's better than

84
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:20,633
the upcoming David Cornsweat suit. So yeah,
I think Tyler Hockland's Superman suit is the

85
00:08:20,693 --> 00:08:24,575
one to be at least in this day and age. I'm
trying to think of what my favorite Superman

86
00:08:24,595 --> 00:08:28,937
suit is. Honestly, it's probably Christopher
Reeves. I know it's kind of dated, but it's

87
00:08:28,997 --> 00:08:33,560
also iconic in my opinion. Maybe if it had a
little bit of texture it would be absolute

88
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,824
perfection, but yeah I think so far that's as
close as we've gotten. What an old man answer.

89
00:08:38,864 --> 00:08:43,328
This is an old man answer, Jonathan. What are
you, an old man? Kids these days can't tell

90
00:08:43,368 --> 00:08:49,313
the difference between just plain old and classic.
Well congrats to Mickey for winning this week's

91
00:08:49,353 --> 00:08:52,996
No Prize. If you the listener want a shot at
winning your own No Prize, stay tuned to later

92
00:08:53,036 --> 00:08:57,400
on this episode when we will be asking another
question of the week. And now that that's done,

93
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,821
on to the news!

94
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:08,289
Alright, in a bit of news that was definitely
not on my bingo card for this year, we learned

95
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:14,554
this past week that Nicolas Cage is set to star
in a Spider-Man Noir live action series for

96
00:09:14,754 --> 00:09:20,059
Amazon produced by Sony. The series is just
going to be titled Noir, which seems like a

97
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:26,184
strange omission of the name of Spider-Man,
but basically it looks like Nicolas Cage is

98
00:09:26,204 --> 00:09:31,808
going to play Peter Parker, the Noir version
of the character that he voiced in the Spider-Man

99
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:37,525
Into the Spider-Verse movie. The character basically
is Spider-Man set in the 1930s Great Depression

100
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:42,030
era. Of course he wears all black, you know,
he shoots guns, he still has organic webs and

101
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,855
everything like that, but the stories are much
more grounded and down to earth and very gritty.

102
00:09:47,616 --> 00:09:54,222
So it should be interesting to get this as a
live action series. This is really bizarre

103
00:09:54,282 --> 00:09:59,507
to me. Like the character wasn't even in Across
the Spider-Verse. So I'm not sure why they're

104
00:09:59,547 --> 00:10:04,371
circling back to him. I don't know if it's just
because of Nicolas Cage's name combined with

105
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:09,516
Spider-Man or what? Yeah, it's strange because
like they could have also developed series

106
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:13,980
around any other number of Spider-Man characters
that were in those films, such as like Spider-Punk

107
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:19,264
or Silk, which actually, you know, she was going
to have a show on Amazon that just got scrapped.

108
00:10:19,765 --> 00:10:25,738
I think it is a little bit strange to have someone
like Nicolas Cage, who's, you know. Not a spring

109
00:10:25,778 --> 00:10:30,562
chicken. He's kind of up there in age, but he'll
be playing a superhero here. I'm guessing they're

110
00:10:30,582 --> 00:10:36,287
gonna kind of tone down the super aspect and
really up the nor aspect where he's gonna be

111
00:10:36,367 --> 00:10:41,832
more of like an investigative reporter who just
happens to have some spider related superpowers.

112
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:47,356
Right, yeah. I'm wondering stylistically how
this is gonna go. Like, is it gonna be more

113
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:52,761
like the Penguin or is it gonna be more like
Sin City? I hope it's like the latter. Well,

114
00:10:53,381 --> 00:10:57,355
uh. I would hope it's like the latter too, like
just make it in black and white, kind of like

115
00:10:57,415 --> 00:11:03,737
how the Spider-Man war universe was depicted
in, into the Spider-Verse. Yeah. I think that'd

116
00:11:03,757 --> 00:11:08,698
be pretty cool. It's just gonna be really weird
to see a 60 year old Peter Parker. Yeah, that's

117
00:11:08,758 --> 00:11:13,320
very strange. Who knows, maybe they'll like
not even make him Peter Parker. It's bizarre

118
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:19,590
in that Sony has the film and live action television
rights to the character of Spider-Man. But

119
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,812
of course, due to their deal with Marvel, they
can't really make a movie starring Spider-Man

120
00:11:23,912 --> 00:11:28,955
set in their Sony Spider-Man universe. That's
why we're getting movies like Venom and Madame

121
00:11:28,995 --> 00:11:34,718
Web and Morbius and stuff like that. This Noir
television series seems kind of like a workaround

122
00:11:34,818 --> 00:11:40,302
to include the Spider-Man character without
still actually including him. Yeah, I have

123
00:11:40,322 --> 00:11:44,024
a feeling that if Nicolas Cage is playing Peter
Parker, Kevin Feige probably has something

124
00:11:44,064 --> 00:11:48,950
to say about that. I wouldn't be surprised if
they renamed him. Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised

125
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:52,891
either, but that would be unfortunate because
then, you know, they're going against the comics.

126
00:11:53,211 --> 00:11:57,432
And then at that point, why even make the show?
But we'll see what happens. We'll see what

127
00:11:57,452 --> 00:12:02,014
they end up going with. The show is actually
being showrun by Oren Uzziel and Steve Lightfoot.

128
00:12:02,194 --> 00:12:07,015
Apparently, it's going to be executive produced
by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the directors

129
00:12:07,075 --> 00:12:11,536
of the Into the Spider-Verse film, which is
good news. We don't know when exactly the show

130
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:16,346
is going to come out. It's currently in development,
so it's probably still a year or two out. You

131
00:12:16,366 --> 00:12:20,869
have to imagine that Spider-Man Noir is probably
going to make an appearance in Beyond the Spider-Verse

132
00:12:20,969 --> 00:12:24,851
then, just so that they have that synergy between,
you know, what's in theaters and what's on

133
00:12:24,891 --> 00:12:29,455
your television screen. Yeah, I wouldn't be
surprised. Like, I think Noir will actually

134
00:12:29,475 --> 00:12:34,358
be a sequel to the character that we see in
the Into the Spider-Verse films, where he's

135
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:40,642
like older and down and out. It has the potential
to be good, but also it's just strange. If

136
00:12:40,702 --> 00:12:46,318
Kraven bombs, I'll be surprised if this even
still happens, honestly. I just think... Sony's

137
00:12:46,438 --> 00:12:50,960
not quite knowing what to do. I don't know,
I think there's a big difference between their

138
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,843
live action villain stuff and they're into the
Spider-Verse stuff. I think this can move forward

139
00:12:55,883 --> 00:13:00,265
despite what happens with Kraven. And who knows,
if this is a success, maybe we'll get like

140
00:13:00,285 --> 00:13:05,548
a Spider-Man India TV show and like a Spider-Punk
TV show. Yeah, that would definitely be cool.

141
00:13:05,588 --> 00:13:11,091
Maybe like an anthology Spider-Man series where
season to season we focus on a different Spider-Verse

142
00:13:11,131 --> 00:13:16,557
character, live action. Sold, and I don't really
care for Spider-Verse. You lost me on the last

143
00:13:16,578 --> 00:13:20,234
part of that sentence. But that brings us to
our question of the week.

144
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:29,995
What celebrity voice actor for a Marvel or DC
animated film would you like to see play the

145
00:13:30,015 --> 00:13:36,417
character in live action? So similar to how
Nick Cage voiced Spider-Man or in the Into

146
00:13:36,437 --> 00:13:39,998
the Spider-Verse movie, he's now playing him
in live action. What other voice actor do you

147
00:13:40,018 --> 00:13:44,619
want to see that happen with? Record your answer

Be sure to answer before May 23rd. We're recording

152
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:09,181
the next episode a little bit early because
of Memorial Day. In DC news, we learned this

153
00:14:09,242 --> 00:14:15,085
past week that DC Studios' second live-action
film, Supergirl, Woman of Tomorrow, has landed

154
00:14:15,225 --> 00:14:25,262
a 2026 release date on June 26th. So it's going
to be 6-2-6-2-6. That's cool. news. Hell yeah

155
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:33,368
it is. Hell yeah. What else is there to say
about this? Well I'll tell you. It turns out

156
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:38,351
that they were really interested in locking
down a release date now that they have a director

157
00:14:38,872 --> 00:14:44,195
in Craig Gillespie. Now he was rumored or in
final talks to be the director of Supergirl

158
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:49,419
Woman of Tomorrow for a few weeks now but apparently
the trades are reporting on the

159
00:14:53,354 --> 00:14:58,836
That's exciting news. Of course, Craig Gillespie
is the director of prior films such as Cruella

160
00:14:59,256 --> 00:15:04,858
and I, Tanya. Both of those, I think, were great
films. So it's pretty exciting to see that

161
00:15:04,918 --> 00:15:10,060
he will be directing Supergirl Woman of Tomorrow.
Holy shit, that's a great get for a director.

162
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:15,243
Hell yeah. That's actually really fascinating.
His stuff tends to be a little bit dark, but

163
00:15:15,263 --> 00:15:20,785
from what I hear about the Supergirl Woman of
Tomorrow storyline, it is a little dark. It

164
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:26,235
is a little bit mature. It's a departure from,
I think, what we typically think of, you know,

165
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:31,696
the lighthearted Supergirl Fair is. Yeah, that
project suddenly got a whole lot more interesting

166
00:15:31,716 --> 00:15:37,038
to me. I wasn't even sure what to think about
it. I know that the Tom King series is highly

167
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:41,239
praised and with that kind of directing talent
behind the camera in Craig Gillespie, this

168
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:44,880
movie has a lot going for it. It seems like
all of a sudden like Oscar worthy or something.

169
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,281
It's weird. Well, there's been a lot of praise
not only about the graphic novel, but also

170
00:15:50,321 --> 00:15:56,083
the script adaptation. written by Anna Noguera.
Apparently it's phenomenal and it seems like

171
00:15:56,103 --> 00:16:02,126
they've really fast tracked this storyline based
off of her really great script. Initially this

172
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:07,808
film wasn't pitched as being the second film
in the DC Studios universe, but now it is.

173
00:16:08,128 --> 00:16:12,470
You know, we got a director for Batman and Robin
and Swamp Thing before we got the director

174
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:16,712
for Super Girl, so I would have imagined that
those projects would have gotten up and running

175
00:16:17,012 --> 00:16:21,994
prior to this, but apparently not. They just
are in love with it. The film of course is

176
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:29,039
going to star Millie Alcock in the lead role.
Still not 100% sure about that casting, but

177
00:16:29,099 --> 00:16:33,742
everything else seems to be going off fairly
well for this production. So it gets me excited.

178
00:16:34,122 --> 00:16:38,785
I'm not sure when they're gonna start shooting
this, but we'll see if the Millie Alcock Supergirl

179
00:16:38,825 --> 00:16:43,127
suit is anything like David Cornswett's Superman
suit. It should be. You would think that it

180
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,609
would be. God, I hope not. Don't hate!

181
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:56,395
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and get into

182
00:16:56,435 --> 00:17:01,965
our main event, where we find out who'd win
in a fight between the Android characters of

183
00:17:02,145 --> 00:17:04,629
Amazo and Bastion.

184
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:25,458
Alright, Amazo versus Bastion. We have two highly
adaptable androids here. They're basically

185
00:17:25,538 --> 00:17:30,262
just going to keep adapting to each other until
one of them can no longer adapt. And then they

186
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:35,647
just both explode. I have no idea how it's gonna
go. It's gonna be a very strange, but interesting

187
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:40,731
battle, pitting these two characters against
each other. Yeah, this specific battle was

188
00:17:40,891 --> 00:17:46,495
suggested, I believe, by our executive producer,
Devin Davis, although he initially suggested

189
00:17:46,596 --> 00:17:51,639
Bastion versus Omak, which I loved. but we've
also been trying to get a mezzo into a duel

190
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:57,201
for a while. Yeah, and we also thought that
omak might actually be a good matchup for deathlock.

191
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:02,723
So that'll be a duel likely in the future. Bastion
is really cool though, because to me Bastion

192
00:18:02,863 --> 00:18:07,425
is the ultimate sentinel robot. In fact, in
my history write up of the character that I'm

193
00:18:07,445 --> 00:18:12,447
going to get into in a short while here, I basically
go over the entire history of the sentinels.

194
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:18,146
He is kind of the culmination of everything
the sentinels had been built for. Yeah, he's

195
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:22,848
like the ultimate X-Men villain, and he's going
up against the ultimate Justice League villain.

196
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:27,870
Is Amazo the ultimate Justice League villain?
I mean, when it comes to androids, I'll say

197
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:34,333
yes. But like how a Sentinel can analyze and
adapt against the mutant that they're fighting,

198
00:18:34,553 --> 00:18:40,895
Amazo can absorb the abilities of the people
that he's fighting. That's right. And Joseph's

199
00:18:40,915 --> 00:18:44,597
not letting me start the match off with all
the powers of the Justice League because he's

200
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:49,130
a big fat cheater. Right, I'm the cheater, because
I won't let you start off with all the powers

201
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:54,092
of the Justice League. Right, okay. Yeah! Alright.
Yeah! To explain the methodology behind our

202
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:59,714
duels, let's go to our sentient duel simulator,
Alfred Jarvis9000. AJ9K, tell our listeners

203
00:18:59,754 --> 00:19:05,496
how you go about determining a winner in our
duel matchups. Yes, of course, sir. The way

204
00:19:05,556 --> 00:19:09,977
I determine a winner between the contestants
is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations

205
00:19:10,077 --> 00:19:14,852
using the characters' statistics. The Monte
Carlo simulation is a probabilistic model used

206
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:20,116
to determine outcomes through random sampling.
In this case, I randomised the statistics along

207
00:19:20,136 --> 00:19:24,600
a normal distribution as a way to simulate the
many variables that can occur during battle.

208
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,764
The stat parameters are based on the official
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters'

209
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:34,969
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat
categories are included such as range, damage

210
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:40,353
potential, versatility and perception in order
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.

211
00:19:40,886 --> 00:19:45,689
The results of the 1,000 simulations provide
a percentage of wins for each character. The

212
00:19:45,709 --> 00:19:50,192
contestant with the higher percentage is declared
the victor, as they have a higher probability

213
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:56,056
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,
neither character should win 100% of the matches.

214
00:19:56,556 --> 00:20:01,039
The comic book stories have shown that there's
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so

215
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:04,962
the confidence rate of my method falls in line
with the precedents that have been established

216
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:10,534
in the source material. My mathematical simulations
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are

217
00:20:10,554 --> 00:20:16,318
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes
tabulated for determination of the winner.

218
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:21,122
Thanks AJ9K! Before we run the simulations though,
we like to break down each character's histories

219
00:20:21,162 --> 00:20:26,566
and abilities before improvising a scenario
on how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations

220
00:20:26,586 --> 00:20:31,670
would play out beat for beat. And I believe
it's my turn to go first with the DC characters

221
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:39,114
backstory, so let me tell you all about Amazo
and his inventor. Now, Professor Anthony Ivo,

222
00:20:39,254 --> 00:20:46,037
the eventual creator of the Android Amazo, grew
up with severe Thanatophobia, or the fear of

223
00:20:46,157 --> 00:20:52,680
death. Obsessed with avoiding death and achieving
immortality, Ivo studied both cybernetics and

224
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,723
genetics, eventually turning to criminal activities
to fund his experiments. While working for

225
00:20:58,743 --> 00:21:04,705
a criminal organization known as Locus, Ivo
was granted access to advanced alien technology

226
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:12,202
and the cadavers of biologically adaptable aliens
from the planet Appalachs. Over time, Ivo developed

227
00:21:12,262 --> 00:21:18,446
the theory that by studying and experimenting
on other species with long lifespans, he could

228
00:21:18,506 --> 00:21:25,491
create an immortality elixir and use it to achieve
eternal life. To help with his plans, Ivo created

229
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:31,726
Amazo, an android equipped with an absorption
cell that Ivo reverse engineered from alien

230
00:21:31,766 --> 00:21:37,288
technology, which allowed Imezo to mimic the
abilities of any superhuman it's encountered.

231
00:21:37,768 --> 00:21:42,929
Imezo targeted the founding members of the Justice
League and used their powers to steal animals

232
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:49,311
required for Ivo's immortality elixir, which
the scientist successfully created and consumed.

233
00:21:49,611 --> 00:21:54,212
The Justice League, however, realized that Imezo
absorbed their weaknesses as well as their

234
00:21:54,252 --> 00:22:00,602
powers, allowing them to defeat both Imezo and
his now immortal maker. Ivo, the latter of

235
00:22:00,622 --> 00:22:06,507
whom was punished with a 500-year prison sentence
in case his immortality elixir actually worked.

236
00:22:07,067 --> 00:22:11,430
You can learn more about the Justice League
in their team duel against the Avengers. Amazo,

237
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:16,754
meanwhile, was kept in the Justice League headquarters
trophy room, where it reawakened several times

238
00:22:17,074 --> 00:22:21,877
and battled the League before being shut down
and put in storage once again. When the original

239
00:22:21,937 --> 00:22:29,062
Justice League team disbanded, a new, smaller
team composed mostly of new setting up their

240
00:22:29,122 --> 00:22:36,046
new headquarters in Detroit. Ivo escaped prison
shortly before this and realized that his elixir

241
00:22:36,226 --> 00:22:41,949
did in fact work, though it also transformed
his appearance, progressively disfiguring him

242
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:48,473
over time. Driven insane by his predicament,
Ivo created android duplicates of himself in

243
00:22:48,513 --> 00:22:53,636
his human form to care for him, though they
ended up locking him up to protect him from

244
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:59,151
his own increasing mental illness. Since Ivo
blamed the Justice League for his appearance,

245
00:22:59,571 --> 00:23:04,673
the Androids decided that they would destroy
the newer, weaker League to please him. Though

246
00:23:04,693 --> 00:23:09,316
they managed to kill the hero Vibe, who you
can learn more about in our Vibe versus Miss

247
00:23:09,356 --> 00:23:15,278
America duel episode, the Androids were later
defeated, but not before they awoke Amazo,

248
00:23:15,538 --> 00:23:20,761
who also attacked the new League members, but
was destroyed by the original members of Martian

249
00:23:20,781 --> 00:23:26,727
Manhunter and Aquaman. As Ivo's body continued
to break down, he eventually wished for death,

250
00:23:26,987 --> 00:23:32,150
and built an army of robots called Amazoids
to kill him, though they were unable to do

251
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:37,252
so. The Amazoids caught the attention of a new
version of the Justice League, who managed

252
00:23:37,272 --> 00:23:43,594
to cure Ivo and return him back to his normal
human state. Over time, however, Ivo succumbed

253
00:23:43,654 --> 00:23:49,117
to his fear of death and took his elixir once
again, determined it was better to live forever

254
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:55,640
as a monster than to die. Eventually, Ivo recreated
an upgraded version of Amazo, who battled with

255
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:00,942
Justice League on several occasions, before
being destroyed by Resurrection Man. Moments

256
00:24:01,042 --> 00:24:06,224
prior to his destruction, however, Amazo was
summoned to the future by a time-controlling

257
00:24:06,364 --> 00:24:12,967
android from the 853rd century named Our Man,
as he considered Amazo something of an ancestor,

258
00:24:13,308 --> 00:24:18,206
since part of the technology within Our Man
was based on Ivo's design. You can learn more

259
00:24:18,226 --> 00:24:24,587
about Ourman in our Ourman vs Bishop episode.
Imezo copied Ourman's time traveling powers

260
00:24:25,008 --> 00:24:30,809
becoming Timezo and wrecked havoc across the
timeline, though he was eventually captured

261
00:24:30,889 --> 00:24:36,071
and defeated by Ourman, who returned him back
to his original time just before Imezo was

262
00:24:36,111 --> 00:24:42,973
destroyed. Initially, Imezo was only capable
of mimicking one power at a time, but Ivo eventually

263
00:24:43,013 --> 00:24:48,512
created a version that contained all the powers
of all Justice League members. This version

264
00:24:48,552 --> 00:24:54,397
of Amazo was nearly successful in destroying
the League until, upon the Atom's suggestion,

265
00:24:54,817 --> 00:25:00,742
Superman disbanded the Justice League and rendered
Amazo powerless, allowing the League to dismantle

266
00:25:00,762 --> 00:25:07,068
him. Batman and Nightwing later found a partially
built Amazo in a weapon shipment and managed

267
00:25:07,168 --> 00:25:12,813
to destroy him. Ivo, meanwhile, in one of his
experiments, had managed to combine his absorption

268
00:25:12,873 --> 00:25:20,376
cell with human ova and DNA to create an android
slash human hybrid version of Amazo, who was

269
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:25,719
adopted and grew into a young man named Frank
Halloran. Frank's powers awoke as a college

270
00:25:25,739 --> 00:25:30,301
student while he was with his girlfriend Sarah,
and though he sought to become a hero named

271
00:25:30,381 --> 00:25:37,044
Kid Amazo, he eventually became mentally unstable
after learning Sarah was actually Ivo's daughter,

272
00:25:37,405 --> 00:25:42,579
and he was later destroyed by Batman. When Ivo
secretly installed the Amazo programming in

273
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:47,062
the Android Justice League member Red Tornado,
who you can learn more about in our Red Tornado

274
00:25:47,142 --> 00:25:52,845
vs. Sandman episode, Amazo was able to take
over his body and ambush the League, leading

275
00:25:52,905 --> 00:25:58,468
to an entire army of Red Tornado robots. The
League was forced to destroy Red Tornado's

276
00:25:58,508 --> 00:26:04,052
body, and when they built a new one, Amazo took
control of that one as well, forcing the League

277
00:26:04,072 --> 00:26:10,172
to teleport him into the gravity well of a distant
star. In post-Flashpoint continuity, Professor

278
00:26:10,252 --> 00:26:15,337
Anthony Ivo was the head of Star Labs' Red Room
project, which collected and studied the most

279
00:26:15,377 --> 00:26:21,322
dangerous technology encountered by the government.
As a result of the project, Ivo was able to

280
00:26:21,382 --> 00:26:27,308
develop organic pattern processing technology
that mimicked organic life down to the cellular

281
00:26:27,408 --> 00:26:33,273
level. This eventually led to the artificially
intelligent Amaze computer operating system.

282
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:38,994
which eventually became corrupted and inhabited
the body of an android from the Red Room becoming

283
00:26:39,214 --> 00:26:45,519
Amazo, which learned from and adopted the Justice
League's powers when it was attacked. Though

284
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:51,004
Amazo was defeated, the Amazo system eventually
infiltrated the League's satellite computer

285
00:26:51,024 --> 00:26:56,188
system, allowing it to build itself a new body
on board the satellite where it attacked and

286
00:26:56,288 --> 00:27:02,408
was defeated by Batman. After Amazo was defeated,
Lex Luthor used the operating system programming

287
00:27:02,448 --> 00:27:08,933
to develop an organic Amazo virus that infected
people and gave them superpowers. The first

288
00:27:09,013 --> 00:27:15,377
person treated for the virus, a Lex Corp scientist
named Armin Icarus, went insane and became

289
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:21,781
the new Amazo. However, for this speculation,
I will be going with the OS Android version

290
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:27,445
of the character as the organic AI learning
aspect makes more sense to me than the absorption

291
00:27:27,525 --> 00:27:34,476
cell. Powers-wise, by default, Amazo is built
with an extremely durable and strong robotic

292
00:27:34,516 --> 00:27:40,819
body and shell that houses an artificial intelligence
capable of learning and mimicking the abilities,

293
00:27:41,019 --> 00:27:46,761
including Superhuman, of those it encounters.
And that's Amazo. These two characters are

294
00:27:46,821 --> 00:27:51,063
actually vastly similar, not just in their power
sets, but also in their histories. And I think

295
00:27:51,083 --> 00:27:56,325
you'll find a lot of weird parallels in the
Bastion backstory, even through the Sentinels

296
00:27:56,425 --> 00:28:03,183
and everything like that. Wait, was there a
Tyne Bastion as well? Haha, kinda. But let

297
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:08,926
me get into it. Now to know the history of the
X-Men villain Bastion is to first know the

298
00:28:08,966 --> 00:28:15,449
history of the sentinel robots. Decades ago,
a robotics expert named Bolobar Trask worked

299
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:21,251
with the US government to address the growing
mutant population. Driven by a desire to protect

300
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:27,313
humanity from mutants with dangerous abilities,
Trask created a prototype robot called Mastermold.

301
00:28:27,734 --> 00:28:33,497
the very first sentinel robot which was designed
to create other sentinels. The sentinel robots

302
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:38,861
were programmed to capture and exterminate mutant
threats, which they did with frightening efficiency.

303
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:44,125
However, Trask underestimated Master Mold's
artificial intelligence, which deduced that

304
00:28:44,165 --> 00:28:49,909
in order to protect mankind, the sentinels must
also protect humanity from itself, and therefore

305
00:28:49,949 --> 00:28:55,633
destroy it. Trask then helped the X-Men blow
up Master Mold and the sentinel base, losing

306
00:28:55,693 --> 00:29:00,055
his life in the process. You can learn more
about the X-Men in their team duel against

307
00:29:00,095 --> 00:29:06,038
the Titans. However, Trask's death did not stop
Master Mold and the Sentinel program from resurrecting

308
00:29:06,158 --> 00:29:11,661
time and again, manifesting various kinds of
Sentinels, including the 20-foot tall Mark

309
00:29:11,821 --> 00:29:18,245
II Sentinels, the X-Sentinels, which were robotic
replicas of the X-Men Mutant Heroes, and Wild

310
00:29:18,325 --> 00:29:23,848
Sentinels, which were as big as cities. No matter
their form, Sentinels always posed one of the

311
00:29:23,868 --> 00:29:29,728
greatest threats to the X-Men and throughout
their history. This threat also extended decades

312
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:35,413
into the future, where in the days of future
past timeline, Sentinels took control over

313
00:29:35,513 --> 00:29:40,697
North America, killing most of the mutant population
and turning the continent into a dystopian

314
00:29:40,757 --> 00:29:45,881
nightmare where only humans were permitted to
breed. During this time, the most highly advanced

315
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:51,926
Sentinel prototype yet was created, which was
named Nimrod. He was a scourge to the surviving

316
00:29:52,006 --> 00:29:58,738
mutants of the future, being highly adaptable,
infinitely immensely powerful and utterly unstoppable.

317
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:03,801
At one point, he was pulled from the time stream
and traveled from the future into the present

318
00:30:03,841 --> 00:30:09,383
time. While he initially posed a threat to the
X-Men, over time, his advanced artificial mind

319
00:30:09,443 --> 00:30:15,045
began to develop emotions, and he discovered
empathy, choosing to become a robot vigilante

320
00:30:15,065 --> 00:30:21,468
of sorts, protecting all life instead of eradicating
mutants. This was short lived, however, as

321
00:30:21,568 --> 00:30:26,818
Nimrod soon came into contact with the remnants
of a circuit board. belonging to Mastermold,

322
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:31,900
which corrupted Nimrod's systems and set him
on a mission of eliminating both mutants and

323
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:38,303
humans. The Mastermold and Nimrod fusion proved
to be unstoppable by the X-Men team, however

324
00:30:38,423 --> 00:30:43,365
Nimrod was able to assert dominance over the
Mastermold intelligence, convincing it that

325
00:30:43,545 --> 00:30:48,487
in their synthesis they had become a mutant
of sorts, and therefore must also be destroyed.

326
00:30:48,927 --> 00:30:54,870
Concurring, Mastermold self-destructed, knowing
that the fragments could recombine, The X-Men

327
00:30:54,950 --> 00:31:01,152
pushed the Nimrod Mastermold body into a transformative,
mystic gateway known as the Siege Perilous.

328
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:09,236
The portal merged the two into a tech hybrid
being, with no memory of who or what he previously

329
00:31:09,316 --> 00:31:15,198
was. He was found by a woman who adopted him
as her surrogate son, giving him the new name

330
00:31:15,418 --> 00:31:20,940
Sebastian. He joined the Friends of Humanity
anti-mutant group and used its political connections

331
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:27,143
to gain influence and lead a new Pentagon-backed
group. initiative known as Operation Zero Tolerance,

332
00:31:27,563 --> 00:31:34,845
which resurrected the Sentinel program. Sebastian,
now just going by Bastion, developed nanotechnology

333
00:31:34,905 --> 00:31:40,546
which would infect humans with cybernetic implants,
making them sleeper agents that, when activated,

334
00:31:40,886 --> 00:31:46,428
would be driven to detect and capture mutants.
Calling these human cyborgs Prime Sentinels,

335
00:31:46,928 --> 00:31:52,350
Bastion used them to capture several X-Men and
take over the Xavier Institute. Eventually,

336
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:58,293
the X-Men defeated Bastion, revealing him as
a cybernetic being, and Operation Zero Tolerance

337
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:03,556
was shut down. Bastion was remanded into S.H.I.E.L.D.
custody, where he escaped and tried to transform

338
00:32:03,596 --> 00:32:09,399
the android hero Machine Man into the Sentinel
Supreme, though he was stopped by Cable, whom

339
00:32:09,419 --> 00:32:14,342
you can learn more about in our Booster Gold
vs Cable duel episode. Later, Bastion was decapitated

340
00:32:14,382 --> 00:32:18,744
by Wolverine, and his head was recovered by
the US government to retrieve the information

341
00:32:18,784 --> 00:32:24,227
he had stolen from the Xavier Institute. Bastion
Head was then stolen by the mutant-hating William

342
00:32:24,267 --> 00:32:30,411
Stryker, who attached it to the body of a Nimrod
series sentinel, as Stryker had access to Nimrod's

343
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:36,334
technology due to time travel. Back online,
Bastion used his nanotech to control and resurrect

344
00:32:36,414 --> 00:32:41,697
some of the X-Men's greatest villains, including
Donald Pierce of the Reavers, Grayden Creed,

345
00:32:41,957 --> 00:32:47,120
and Bolivar Trask himself, calling themselves
the Human Council. Together, they tried to

346
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:52,316
kill the mutant, Hope Summers. who was the first
mutant born after the Scarlet Witch had for

347
00:32:52,356 --> 00:32:58,060
a time erased the abilities of most of Earth's
mutant population. Bastion erected a large

348
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:03,524
dome force field over the X-Men's base and had
his team target their teleporters like Nightcrawler

349
00:33:03,904 --> 00:33:08,568
so they couldn't escape the attack. Bastion
then opened a portal to his home dimension,

350
00:33:08,668 --> 00:33:13,551
Days of Future Past, from where he summoned
a fleet of Nimrod series sentinels to kill

351
00:33:13,591 --> 00:33:19,596
the X-Men. The human council was only defeated.
when the X-Men sent Cable and Cipher to the

352
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:25,801
future to reprogram the Nimrod series sentinels
and destroy the Nimrod master mold. Defeated,

353
00:33:26,041 --> 00:33:31,146
Bastion still tried to kill Hope Summers himself,
though she destroyed him with a massive energy

354
00:33:31,166 --> 00:33:36,790
blast. Bastion managed to survive by escaping
into the future, however, during the time of

355
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:42,475
the war between the X-Men and the Inhumans.
There he started creating new sentinels, however

356
00:33:42,515 --> 00:33:47,582
he was later apparently destroyed by the mutant
who swallowed him with a black hole inside

357
00:33:47,622 --> 00:33:53,885
his head. Powers-wise, Bastion is a techno-organic,
cybernetic hybrid being with enhanced physicals

358
00:33:54,325 --> 00:33:59,947
such as strength, able to lift up to 25 tons,
speed, and durability basically indestructible.

359
00:34:00,307 --> 00:34:05,570
Using nanotechnology, he can transmute humans
into techno-mechanical beings that he can control

360
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:11,952
and he has technopathy in the same manner. Bastion
can techno-morph both himself and any being

361
00:34:11,992 --> 00:34:19,345
he controls, including altering or giving himself
wings or new appendages. This makes him self-repairable

362
00:34:19,505 --> 00:34:24,589
and highly adaptable considering he can also
detect and analyze the abilities of other beings

363
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:33,937
and modify himself accordingly.
Bastion can fire energy blasts and emit energy

364
00:34:33,957 --> 00:34:40,182
shields, and can open portals for teleportation
or time travel. Finally, he has a genius level

365
00:34:40,262 --> 00:34:47,356
intellect having a highly advanced calculating
cybernetic mind. Cybernetic mind. OK, cool.

366
00:34:47,536 --> 00:34:54,404
I have all of that down. Amazer has all of that,
too. Including the techno warping? Well, I

367
00:34:54,424 --> 00:35:00,912
mean, if Bastion has it, yes. Oh, that's right.
That's right. OK. Shoot. Well, we're going

368
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:01,593
to see how this goes.

369
00:35:08,634 --> 00:35:14,678
fantasies collide and heroes clash, one podcast
network rises above the rest. Prepare yourself

Visit dynamicpodcast.com where we settle the
debate and settle the score.

376
00:35:55,758 --> 00:35:58,699
Because now that we got their histories and
abilities out of the way, let's speculate on

377
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:03,960
how one of the 1000 simulated matches will go.
The winner is determined by simulations, not

378
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:09,042
the speculation, but it's fun to imagine how
this fight could play out. AG9K, what are the

379
00:36:09,082 --> 00:36:13,923
rules of our speculation? Well, I should say
there are no rules, other than the characters

380
00:36:13,943 --> 00:36:18,484
have no prior knowledge of the other going into
the fight. All they are aware of starting out

381
00:36:18,804 --> 00:36:23,085
is that the other character is a threat that
needs to be eliminated. For the speculation...

382
00:36:23,542 --> 00:36:28,584
contestants will begin approximately 50 meters
apart in a nondescript environment that will

383
00:36:28,604 --> 00:36:33,947
have no bearing on the match itself as no environmental
statistics are considered in my simulations

384
00:36:34,247 --> 00:36:39,710
the contestants must earn victory on their own
merit. Alright then let's get into it. Amazo

385
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:45,633
and Bastion meet on the battlefield who goes
first? I'm gonna say Bastion goes first because

386
00:36:46,334 --> 00:36:51,557
like it just seems like he has more personality
than Amazo. That's not true. He's gonna analyze

387
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:57,440
and scan Amazo. like a sentinel would and determine
his power set and the best course of action.

388
00:36:57,941 --> 00:37:02,784
Okay, I mean, of course, Amazo's own system
is going to sense that it's being scanned and

389
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:08,769
it's going to mimic that action scanning Bastion
as well. Okay, well Bastion is going to generate

390
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:14,533
these missile pods from his shoulders and he's
going to fire a pair of missiles at Amazo that

391
00:37:14,553 --> 00:37:20,557
just blow him up. Okay, except that, you know,
once Amazo scans Bastion, he instantly learns...

392
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:26,718
everything Bastion could do, including shooting
energy, which a mezzo he's going to do from

393
00:37:26,758 --> 00:37:31,743
his eyes like Superman to shoot down the missiles.
And then he's just going to turn that laser

394
00:37:31,763 --> 00:37:38,048
vision toward Bastion himself and blast his
head off. OK. Energy shield. Bastion's going

395
00:37:38,068 --> 00:37:42,952
to throw up like a pink glowing energy shield
that blocks the lasers. And then he's going

396
00:37:42,972 --> 00:37:49,057
to techno morph from his back a pair of these
razor sharp techno dragon wings kind of thing.

397
00:37:49,406 --> 00:37:54,249
He's going to fly at a mezzo with super speed
and he's going to plow his fist right into

398
00:37:54,269 --> 00:38:00,392
a mezzo's face just spinning his head 180 degrees.
I mean, like, that's fine. I mean, that doesn't

399
00:38:00,432 --> 00:38:06,016
bother him. His head is now backwards. It's
just going to make him angry. And with his

400
00:38:06,096 --> 00:38:11,079
sights still on Bastion who, you know, flew
past him, a mezzo is going to techno morph

401
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:18,063
a ring onto his hand that's going to glow with
that. pink energy and having learned to create

402
00:38:18,164 --> 00:38:24,908
energy shields from Bastion, Amazo is going
to create a like a crude pink energy construct

403
00:38:24,948 --> 00:38:30,692
of a giant hand that slams Bastion down into
the ground and just flattening him. I see what

404
00:38:30,712 --> 00:38:37,757
you're doing here now. You're doing Justice
League powers. Yeah. OK. Well, Bastion, he's

405
00:38:37,777 --> 00:38:42,900
going to grow in size to lift this hand off
of him. He's going to lose the wings, but he's

406
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:48,518
going to become like this 20 foot tall. kind
of disproportionate distorted figure. And he's

407
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:53,600
gonna manifest all of these like hoses from
his back that kind of like snake around and

408
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:58,922
point at Imezo and just like they all blast
him with energy from like 10 different angles,

409
00:38:58,942 --> 00:39:05,984
just pew, pew. Okay, so Imezo, he gets tagged
by like one or two of the lasers we'll say

410
00:39:06,324 --> 00:39:12,398
before he's just gonna start moving, just like
zipping around quickly by generating. energy

411
00:39:12,438 --> 00:39:18,639
boosters on his heels and his back that just
propel him forward like really fast. So, Amazo,

412
00:39:18,779 --> 00:39:25,701
he's running zigzags around the environment
before he runs behind Bastion and generates

413
00:39:25,941 --> 00:39:32,363
his own like hose cable thing that he's going
to lasso around Bastion's neck and he's going

414
00:39:32,383 --> 00:39:37,364
to use his strength to yank him down to the
ground real hard. Okay, well, Bastion is going

415
00:39:37,384 --> 00:39:41,485
to shrink back down to normal size now. He's
going to immediately get up off the ground.

416
00:39:42,094 --> 00:39:49,135
And you done fucked up because Bastion is gonna
grab Amazo's lasso and he's gonna transmit

417
00:39:49,195 --> 00:39:54,857
his technovirus through it and that's gonna
infect Amazo and turn him into Bastion's puppet

418
00:39:55,297 --> 00:40:00,859
matchover. I mean jokes on you because like
as soon as Bastion starts to do that suddenly

419
00:40:00,919 --> 00:40:07,721
this wing shaped blade severs the lasso cord
in half before the technovirus could even reach

420
00:40:07,781 --> 00:40:15,224
Amazo and Amazo's by throwing several more of
those wing shaped blades that embed themselves

421
00:40:15,284 --> 00:40:22,948
into Bastion's torso and upload their own Amazos
techno virus into him, taking over Bastion's

422
00:40:22,988 --> 00:40:28,931
mind. You can't do, Amazos so stupid, anything
that Bastion does, Amazos just do it back.

423
00:40:29,231 --> 00:40:33,434
That's right. I'm gonna say though that the
exact opposite happens. I'm gonna say that

424
00:40:33,734 --> 00:40:40,557
Bastion converts these Amazo batterings or whatever
into small sentinel drones that look like...

425
00:40:41,342 --> 00:40:46,826
Sentinels from the Matrix movie like with small
wild sentinels, okay Okay, and they're fully

426
00:40:46,866 --> 00:40:52,930
under Bastion's control Bastion is gonna send
them out to surround a mezzo and These sentinels

427
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:56,952
are gonna like wrap them up in their tentacles
and they're gonna overload them with energy

428
00:40:56,972 --> 00:41:01,556
that just blow them up to pieces We're just
like nuts and bolts flying everywhere We had

429
00:41:01,576 --> 00:41:07,320
the heck did a few batterings turn into like
a swarm of flying sentinel drones Technomorphing

430
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:12,967
man, and it's not like a swarm. It's only like
three or four or whatever. In fact, where did

431
00:41:13,207 --> 00:41:18,449
Omizo even get the batarangs from? If we're
asking questions like that. Uh, I don't even

432
00:41:18,469 --> 00:41:24,712
know. Like, where did Bastion get his wings
from? Again, techno-morphing. You know, he

433
00:41:24,752 --> 00:41:29,774
just used some of the mass from his back. He's
a dense dude. You know, he can make wings out

434
00:41:29,794 --> 00:41:35,437
of his back. So is that how he grew in size
earlier? He just like expanded his dense volume?

435
00:41:36,477 --> 00:41:41,335
Uh. Like I pictured it as more of like a disproportionate
growth. He was only using the mass he had available

436
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:46,097
to grow to 20 feet tall. So I kind of pictured
him as like this robot slenderman with like

437
00:41:46,317 --> 00:41:52,200
cables coming out of his back firing glazers.
Ah, that's creepy. Yeah, he get pretty creepy

438
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:59,263
looking sometimes. OK, OK. So Amazo is getting
overloaded by these drones, but he's also working

439
00:41:59,323 --> 00:42:05,445
at assimilating these drones back onto his side,
which he does, and they're going to like drill

440
00:42:05,485 --> 00:42:12,963
into the ground. and form the frame of this
crazy looking wild sentinel made of metal cables

441
00:42:13,083 --> 00:42:19,748
and earth that looks like a giant lobster squid.
And it just erupts from the ground and falls

442
00:42:19,808 --> 00:42:26,514
on Bastion and devours him, destroying his technology
and bringing an end to this match. He summoned

443
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:34,620
the Kraken. Okay. Except that as the techno
squid creature or whatever is about to land

444
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:41,888
on Bastion, he's portal above him into the Days
of Future Past timeline. And the creature and

445
00:42:41,928 --> 00:42:46,271
Amazo, they're both gonna get pulled into this
time portal and they just get their asses handed

446
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:52,855
to them by a legion of Nimrod series sentinels.
Dang, okay. Well, I mean, if time play is an

447
00:42:52,935 --> 00:42:57,917
issue now, Amazo is just gonna generate his
own time portal while he's in the Days of Future

448
00:42:57,957 --> 00:43:04,101
Past. And he's gonna go all the way to the 853rd
century where he's gonna once again become

449
00:43:04,341 --> 00:43:12,319
Timeazo. And he's just gonna travel all throughout
time acquiring all the powers of every DC character

450
00:43:12,439 --> 00:43:17,563
ever And he's gonna return back to the Days
of Future Past and just beat the shit out of

451
00:43:17,583 --> 00:43:23,047
those Nimrods After which he's gonna go back
to where Bastion is and just beat the shit

452
00:43:23,107 --> 00:43:29,672
out of him Ending this match for real this time
Okay Um, I'm gonna say though that Bastion

453
00:43:29,712 --> 00:43:34,592
was quicker with his time travel and he already
went and turned all the DC heroes into his

454
00:43:34,652 --> 00:43:41,698
personal sentinel army. So Time-Mazo becomes
Die-Mazo. I don't know. Dead-Mazo? Whatever.

455
00:43:42,178 --> 00:43:46,882
Match is over. How are you going to be faster
with time travel though? Easy. Time travel.

456
00:43:47,282 --> 00:43:54,168
There's your answer. All right, I guess we'll
leave it there. Either a Meizo acquires all

457
00:43:54,208 --> 00:44:02,122
of the powers of every DC hero ever using time
travel and uses it to destroy Bastion or Bastion

458
00:44:02,342 --> 00:44:08,847
uses time travel to assimilate every DC hero
into a prime sentinel. Why has it got to be

459
00:44:08,867 --> 00:44:13,850
the DC heroes? Why can't you go to your own
universe? Sure, you do it to Marvel, too. The

460
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:17,453
human ones, at least. But yeah, we'll leave
it there. We'll input the character stats.

461
00:44:17,553 --> 00:44:21,535
We'll run the simulations and find out which
of these ending scenarios happens when we come

462
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:29,040
back with a winner. AG9K, hit it! Inputting
data, running calculations, processing results,

463
00:44:29,561 --> 00:44:35,956
simulations complete. Okay, so it was a huge
challenge coming up with a mezzo stats considering

464
00:44:35,976 --> 00:44:41,139
the fact that there's so many different versions
of this character like you have one guy who

465
00:44:41,159 --> 00:44:45,501
could take on the entire Justice League and
you have another version that can be defeated

466
00:44:45,541 --> 00:44:51,244
by Batman. Yes, so what we decided in the end
was to kind of average the Justice League powered

467
00:44:51,305 --> 00:44:56,668
version of a mezzo with what we call the base
model a mezzo, which is pretty still damn powerful.

468
00:44:57,168 --> 00:45:03,148
But at that level, we got a character who was
pretty on par with Bastion because like the

469
00:45:03,188 --> 00:45:07,452
Justice League Amazo is going to be way too
powerful for Bastion, but the base model is

470
00:45:07,552 --> 00:45:13,577
not nearly powerful enough. Right. Yeah. We
said that Amazo came out on top in terms of

471
00:45:14,058 --> 00:45:22,185
speed and strength and fighting, surprisingly.
Amazo is much more of a brawler than Bastion.

472
00:45:22,645 --> 00:45:28,238
Yeah. Bastion, however, came out ahead in terms
of durability, considering like, He could get

473
00:45:28,298 --> 00:45:33,301
his head blown off and reconstitute himself.
He's like infinitely repairable. Bastion also

474
00:45:33,321 --> 00:45:38,283
got the edge in intellect because Amazo's a
big dum-dum for a robot, which is kind of surprising.

475
00:45:39,304 --> 00:45:45,507
And then Bastion also came out ahead on versatility,
which that seems weird, right? Yeah, and that

476
00:45:45,527 --> 00:45:51,511
was a result simply of the averaging that we
did between Amazo's most powerful form and

477
00:45:51,551 --> 00:45:56,894
his base form. Interestingly enough, Bastion
came out a little bit ahead on that. Yeah,

478
00:45:56,914 --> 00:46:01,995
because base level Amazo doesn't really do a
whole lot. Like he can fly and punch things

479
00:46:02,155 --> 00:46:07,417
and shoot lasers from his eyes, but not too
much else. Right. Yeah. So taking all of this

480
00:46:07,457 --> 00:46:12,058
into consideration, who do you think came out
on top? I'm going to give it to my boy Bastion

481
00:46:12,178 --> 00:46:17,039
for sure. Well, Instagram disagrees with you
because 70 percent of them said that Amazo

482
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:22,561
is going to win. And I feel like I'm on this
like DC hot streak when it comes to Instagram,

483
00:46:22,601 --> 00:46:28,127
like the past like five or six polls. have all
gone in DC's favor, which I feel like had been

484
00:46:28,207 --> 00:46:33,910
really rare in the past. Yeah, I think consistently
Marvel characters usually get the win in those

485
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:38,053
polls. So, yeah, I don't know what's happening.
It feels like the tide of public opinion is

486
00:46:38,073 --> 00:46:43,155
kind of turning against Marvel, which I don't
like Marvel fans. Let's represent ourselves

487
00:46:43,195 --> 00:46:48,098
in these polls, but also be honest, you know,
with who you think will win, obviously Marvel

488
00:46:48,118 --> 00:46:53,941
characters. Well, let's see if that's true.
A.G. 9K, the results, please. Hey, you are,

489
00:46:53,961 --> 00:47:05,798
sir. The winner of the matchup between Imezo
and Bastion is Bastion! He won 552 of the 1000

490
00:47:06,258 --> 00:47:15,963
matches or 55.2% compared to Imezo's 44.8% win
rate. I feel like that makes sense. Really,

491
00:47:16,023 --> 00:47:21,825
Bastion would just turn Imezo into a sentinel.
For as powerful as Imezo is and his whole adapting

492
00:47:21,845 --> 00:47:26,436
ability... At the end of the day, he's made
out of technology that Bastion can just manipulate.

493
00:47:26,856 --> 00:47:31,199
But that doesn't make sense to me as reasoning
why he would win, because Amazo could just

494
00:47:31,219 --> 00:47:35,262
do the same thing to Bastion if they're, you
know, going toe to toe against each other.

495
00:47:35,782 --> 00:47:40,646
Ultimately, I think it really comes down to
intelligence because what Amazo think to do

496
00:47:40,666 --> 00:47:46,450
that before Bastion would, and I'm not quite
sure he would. Overall, though, this was pretty

497
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:53,038
close. So, I mean, who's to say? I'm really
glad we went with Bastion. for this matchup.

498
00:47:53,198 --> 00:47:58,862
I think initially I wanted to do Nimrod the
sentinel from Days of Future Past who is my

499
00:47:58,902 --> 00:48:03,285
favorite sentinel. But Devin Davis, one of the
executive producers, was like, now I should

500
00:48:03,305 --> 00:48:10,550
be Bastion. Not only because he's a major villain
in the X-Men 97 animated series, but also,

501
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:17,255
you know, Nimrod becomes Bastion. So Bastion
is kind of like the final form of the sentinel

502
00:48:17,315 --> 00:48:21,946
robot. And everybody loves the sentinels. I
thought this was a great match. Well, I thought

503
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:28,448
it sucked. You wanted to go with the Mark 2
Sentinel robots, right? I wanted to go with

504
00:48:28,468 --> 00:48:34,471
the Justice League of Mezzo. Dude is hella powerful,
way more powerful than Bastion could ever be.

505
00:48:35,151 --> 00:48:39,153
And I don't know, this loss just makes me feel
dirty. It makes me feel like Bastion could

506
00:48:39,193 --> 00:48:44,175
defeat the Justice League, which I know he can't.
I mean, if the Justice League were all robots,

507
00:48:44,735 --> 00:48:49,177
he'd have a pretty damn good chance of taking
over. So he has no chance then, because none

508
00:48:49,197 --> 00:48:55,068
of them are robots. Well, maybe Cyborg. I don't
know. I mean, Cyborg has technopathy too. So

509
00:48:55,369 --> 00:48:58,992
that's true. That's true. But that does it for
this duel guys. Let us know what you thought
