00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,957
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:29,319
Welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:34,940
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:40,782
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous
Joe. And in this episode, we are reviewing

5
00:00:41,102 --> 00:00:46,964
the Amazon exclusive animated series, Batman
Caped Crusader. It was developed by Bruce Timm,

6
00:00:47,224 --> 00:00:52,325
the very same Bruce Timm that created the Batman
cartoon series from the 90s that we all know

7
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:57,904
and love. Yeah, Jonathan and I are still in
what we call review hell because DC decided

8
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:02,727
to release a whole lot of summer projects within
the same like four week time span. Just bear

9
00:01:02,747 --> 00:01:06,949
with us. We're almost through to the end, I
think with the Joker Follyado movie. Yeah,

10
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:12,812
see this kind of like, you know, Dante's Inferno
coming out through Paradiso and the Joker Follyado

11
00:01:12,832 --> 00:01:17,195
film is Paradiso because it's gonna be so damn
good. Have you seen the reviews of it so far?

12
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:22,830
I don't trust those Rotten Tomatoes critics.
Those guys are assholes. Anyway, before we

13
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:26,634
get into our review of Batman Caves Crusader,
we're going to break down the comic book movie

14
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:32,739
news from the past week, including the Venom,
The Last Dance final trailer and the news that

15
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,763
Destin Daniel Crichton is in talks to direct
Spider-Man 4. As always, we list our segment

30
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:56,988
film. One of the best films of all time. On

out of the way, quick to the No Prize! A No

37
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:36,503
Prize is an award Marvel used to give out to
fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel No Prize,

38
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:40,946
is a digital award we post on Instagram for
the person that we feel gave the best answer

39
00:03:40,986 --> 00:03:46,330
to our question of the week. Last week we asked,
who would you cast as Richard Ryder in the

40
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:51,594
Nova series and Hal Jordan and Jon Stewart in
the Lantern series? And we got a whole lot

41
00:03:51,614 --> 00:03:54,857
of answers. Let's go ahead and run down our
honorable mentions as well as the No Prize

42
00:03:54,897 --> 00:04:01,321
winner. Our first honorable mention goes to
Jose Marcial, who said, For Hal Jordan, I would

43
00:04:01,422 --> 00:04:06,564
cast Josh Brolin since how Jordan is supposed
to be older and more gruff in this version.

44
00:04:07,445 --> 00:04:15,749
And for Jon Stewart, I would cast David Johnson.
He played Andy in Alien Romulus. He's like

45
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:22,573
best part of that movie and he's a really good
actor just from that role alone. And what was

46
00:04:22,633 --> 00:04:27,996
that other part of the question? So this may
have been recorded before we received news

47
00:04:28,016 --> 00:04:32,447
that Josh Brolin has actually withdrawn his
name. from the running for the character of

48
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:37,450
Hal Jordan. So, you know, that's not gonna happen,
although it wouldn't have been a terrible choice.

49
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:43,575
As far as David Johnson goes, I have not seen
Alien Romulus, but I've heard amazing things

50
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:48,478
about the movie and his performance in particular.
So this answer gets me pretty excited. Yeah,

51
00:04:48,518 --> 00:04:52,902
I was waiting to see Alien Romulus until I saw
Alien Covenant, because I haven't seen that

52
00:04:52,942 --> 00:04:58,225
yet either. But I am super excited to see Alien
Romulus. It looks really damn good. Of course,

53
00:04:58,466 --> 00:05:04,968
Jose did not get to an answer for Nova because
no one cares. Nobody got time for a Nova answer.

54
00:05:05,508 --> 00:05:11,291
Actually, a lot of the callers this week didn't
answer the full question with all three characters,

55
00:05:11,631 --> 00:05:17,073
Jon Stewart, Hal Jordan, and Richard Ryder.
Only a few of them did, but not our next honorable

56
00:05:17,113 --> 00:05:22,576
mention, Miggy Mathingian, who said, Hey, what's
up guys, this is Miggy. And even though it

57
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:26,257
might be confusing for general audiences, from
the short list, I would pick Chris Pine to

58
00:05:26,277 --> 00:05:33,013
play Hal Jordan. And then the Hollywood Reporter
said that they would want a newer actor, younger

59
00:05:33,093 --> 00:05:37,756
actor to play John Stewart. So I would go with
Malachi Kirby. Even though I haven't seen him

60
00:05:38,076 --> 00:05:45,081
play in anything, I've seen that he is like
an award winning actor. So, and I think he's

61
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:49,384
like a lesser known name. So yeah, Chris Pine
and Malachi Kirby. Yeah. Miggi's concern is

62
00:05:49,424 --> 00:05:55,368
that audiences might find it confusing to see
Chris Pine as Hal Jordan, considering he was

63
00:05:55,628 --> 00:06:00,759
very prominently Steve Trevor. in the Wonder
Woman films. That said, I think he would make

64
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:06,861
a great, damn near perfect Hal Jordan. The guy
is a great actor, and you know, we've already

65
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:12,844
seen that he could pull off the role of brave
pilot. Yeah, I'm not sure how his role as Hal

66
00:06:12,884 --> 00:06:18,206
Jordan would differ too much from Steve Trevor
from the Wonder Woman films, but I really like

67
00:06:18,226 --> 00:06:23,368
the answer of Malachi Kirby as Jon Stewart.
In fact, I'm going to say don't get him for

68
00:06:23,408 --> 00:06:27,934
Jon Stewart and let's get him for the next Black
Panther. Because... Dude could totally nail

69
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:34,436
that role. Well too bad, cause Team DC already
called dibs. Great answer, Miggy. Our next

70
00:06:34,476 --> 00:06:40,297
honorable mention goes to Daniel Alonso, who
said, All right, I'm going to start making

71
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:45,439
an effort to send a message in every week because
y'all's new stuff is also great. So I'm gonna

72
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:50,620
start off with a co-co-combo and answer last
week's. My favorite episode is Hit Monkey versus

73
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,558
Gleek, funniest shit so far. Casting for Hal
Jordan, I would go with Bradley Cooper. for

74
00:06:56,598 --> 00:07:02,039
Richard Rider, I would do Liam Hemsworth. And
bonus, I would have cast Michael Fassbender

75
00:07:02,059 --> 00:07:06,801
as Dr. Doom. I believe he could have brought
the gravitas that the role needed. All right,

76
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:10,862
yeah, Daniel gave a few more answers than we
asked. He also answered last week's question

77
00:07:10,922 --> 00:07:15,203
of, what's your favorite episode of Dynamic
Duel? Thank you for doing that. I really like

78
00:07:15,223 --> 00:07:20,184
his answer of Bradley Cooper for Hal Jordan,
though. Yeah, absolutely. I've always wanted

79
00:07:20,224 --> 00:07:26,230
to see Bradley Cooper take on a superhero role,
and... To me, Hal Jordan makes the most sense

80
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:31,311
for him. I know he's an actor who really likes
to stretch his craft, so I'm not sure how attracted

81
00:07:31,331 --> 00:07:35,953
to that role he would be, but he would be amazing
in it, absolutely. He would actually be my

82
00:07:35,993 --> 00:07:41,114
number one pick, I think. My number one dream
casting, for sure. And Liam Hemsworth for Richard

83
00:07:41,154 --> 00:07:45,755
Ryder, I can see it working, you know, he looks
awful lot like his brother Chris Hemsworth,

84
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:50,357
who plays Thor, but I don't think that's too
big of an issue, they can make their Richard

85
00:07:50,397 --> 00:07:54,278
Ryder look a little bit different by dying his
hair or something. I don't know. but he definitely

86
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:59,501
looks like Richard Ryder. So yeah, it could
totally work. Yeah, I mean, as long as you

87
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:05,724
keep Thor with a beard and Richard Ryder without
a beard, it's fine. It works out. Yeah, I don't

88
00:08:05,744 --> 00:08:10,527
think you could pull off the Nova helmet with
a beard. I don't think, which makes me sad

89
00:08:10,547 --> 00:08:16,230
because now I feel like I can never be Nova.
You never could. We're gonna give a special

90
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:21,373
thanks to Mason Thompson and Scott Camacho for
calling in and leaving their answers. Scotty.

91
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:27,542
your idea of casting Robert Downey Jr. as Richard
Ryder was hilarious. I laughed my ass off.

92
00:08:28,562 --> 00:08:34,787
But the winner of this week's No Prize is Cyrus
Moore, who said, Hey guys, Cyrus Moore here.

93
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:41,592
So the perfect DC lanterns casting for Hal Jordan
is Bradley Cooper, Shamar Moore for Jon Stewart,

94
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:47,896
and I don't really know the Nova Corps very
well, but I feel like Logan Lerman from The

95
00:08:47,956 --> 00:08:54,203
Maze Runner would make a pretty good Nova Corps
member for Richard Ryder. But yeah, Bradley

96
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:59,306
Cooper and Shamar Moore would be perfect choices
to be lanterns. Thank you guys. Yeah, again,

97
00:08:59,346 --> 00:09:05,489
Bradley Cooper as Hal Jordan is the best possible
outcome. Shamar Moore would actually make a

98
00:09:05,749 --> 00:09:10,391
perfect Jon Stewart if he was younger, I think.
Shamar Moore, I think, has aged out of that

99
00:09:10,431 --> 00:09:15,966
role. But considering he had a long running
role on the show, Criminal Minds. where he's

100
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:20,290
kind of done this whole true detective style
thing, which is what the lantern show is being

101
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:25,835
compared to. Yeah, he would be great. And then
Logan Lerman as Richard Ryder. I actually like

102
00:09:25,855 --> 00:09:30,379
this casting the best. Logan Lerman was actually
not in the Maze Runner movie. That was Daniel

103
00:09:30,439 --> 00:09:36,044
O'Brien. Logan Lerman was Percy Jackson. He
was in those films. But I remember his name

104
00:09:36,064 --> 00:09:40,708
was tossed around for Spider-Man back when they
were casting for Spider-Man Homecoming and

105
00:09:40,728 --> 00:09:44,431
Tom Holland ended up getting the role. But I
think that Logan Lerman definitely looks like

106
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:47,773
Richard Rider from the comics and could totally
pull it off. And the guy could act as well,

107
00:09:47,793 --> 00:09:52,617
like I remember seeing him in the Noah movie.
And he did a fantastic job. But great answer,

108
00:09:52,637 --> 00:09:56,440
Cyrus Moore, you win this week's No Prize. If
you the listener want a shot at winning your

109
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:00,903
own No Prize, stay tuned to later on in this
episode when we'll be asking another question

110
00:10:00,943 --> 00:10:04,205
of the week. And now that that's done, onto
the news!

111
00:10:09,806 --> 00:10:14,667
This past week we got the final trailer for
the Venom, the last dance movie that's coming

112
00:10:14,767 --> 00:10:19,508
out in October. It is the second major trailer
that we've gotten for this film. And I have

113
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:24,070
to say that actually this trailer impressed
me a whole lot more than the first one. I think

114
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,911
the first one I was being really whiny about
it because I hate the title of the film and

115
00:10:29,451 --> 00:10:35,493
we weren't quite sure what was going on with
the story. But you throw null in there and

116
00:10:35,573 --> 00:10:41,036
you got me hooked my friend. As soon as I saw
that the main bad guy of this movie was not

117
00:10:41,076 --> 00:10:46,821
going to be Chiwetel Isheophore's Orwell Taylor,
and that it was going to be null, I was blown

118
00:10:46,861 --> 00:10:51,024
away. That was the best case scenario. Yeah,
all of a sudden the movie seems almost worth

119
00:10:51,104 --> 00:10:58,050
it. I'm not going to lie. I actually enjoyed
this trailer. Like I did not expect to, but

120
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,433
I don't know what it was. Just I don't know
the music and just the relationship between

121
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:07,237
the two characters. I just found it charming.
I'm trying really hard not to get excited.

122
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:12,605
at all for this movie because I don't want to
be let down considering it's Sony who's making

123
00:11:12,625 --> 00:11:18,269
the film. But this was a good trailer. Well,
we can all agree that Venom Let There Be Carnage

124
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:25,874
sucked balls, right? It really sucked. The first
Venom movie was not great, but it was novel

125
00:11:25,914 --> 00:11:30,578
for the way it portrayed the Eddie Brock Venom
relationship. The relationship between those

126
00:11:30,598 --> 00:11:35,361
two characters is the best thing about this
entire franchise. And the way the third trailer

127
00:11:35,401 --> 00:11:40,700
really sold the perhaps culmination of that
relationship I thought was really enticing.

128
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:46,623
I want to see how this story might end, if it
does. I mean, like, both of the trailers that

129
00:11:46,643 --> 00:11:52,187
came out for this film have heavily alluded
to the idea of Eddie Brock or Venom sacrificing

130
00:11:52,227 --> 00:11:56,629
themselves for the other. I'm totally not sold
that that's gonna happen, but it's possible.

131
00:11:56,789 --> 00:12:02,213
You know, Tom Hardy may in fact want to pull
a Logan and go out in style, you know, but

132
00:12:02,253 --> 00:12:06,512
I'm still really hoping that somehow... Venom
ends up in a Spider-Man movie or vice versa.

133
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:12,537
And, you know, not counting the stupid post
credit stuff from No Way Home. But yeah, Null

134
00:12:12,657 --> 00:12:17,982
is going to be in this film. And for those of
you who may not know who he is, he is the primordial

135
00:12:18,142 --> 00:12:23,867
deity who created the symbiotes. And he is a
total badass. He was the main villain in the

136
00:12:23,887 --> 00:12:28,392
King and Black storyline from the comics, which
was a great run. It was a great story. I highly

137
00:12:28,432 --> 00:12:32,627
suggest reading it. But he's a badass like.
on the same level as Thanos. Like it took every

138
00:12:32,687 --> 00:12:37,390
single Marvel hero on Earth to defeat this guy.
So it'll be interesting to see him going up

139
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:43,114
against Venom in this film. Apparently he is
the one that the symbiotes that came to Earth

140
00:12:43,154 --> 00:12:49,138
in the first movie were escaping from and he
is the one who sends the xenophages down to

141
00:12:49,238 --> 00:12:53,381
Earth. Those are the creatures that attack Venom
on the plane at the beginning of this trailer.

142
00:12:53,801 --> 00:12:58,565
But does Null ever come to Earth in the comics?
He does, yeah, but they're probably going to

143
00:12:58,585 --> 00:13:04,112
have to nerf him a little bit. because he's
insanely powerful. Like he could kill Celestials,

144
00:13:04,252 --> 00:13:08,615
if you guys remember Celestials from the Eternals
movie. And here he's only going up against

145
00:13:08,675 --> 00:13:13,159
Venom. So they're probably gonna have to nerf
him, which is a shame, but just to see him

146
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:18,462
on screen will be worth it, I think. We don't
know who's playing Null as of yet. There are

147
00:13:18,542 --> 00:13:23,366
some rumors going around that maybe Reese Ifans
is gonna play him. And we do see Reese later

148
00:13:23,466 --> 00:13:28,409
on in this trailer, which is super confusing
because the actor played Kurt Connors, the

149
00:13:28,489 --> 00:13:34,538
Lizard. in the amazing Spider-Man franchise.
So it's weird to see him in this movie. Yeah,

150
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:42,104
considering that Reese Ifans was recently seen
in a MCU Spider-Man movie, I doubt that's the

151
00:13:42,185 --> 00:13:48,090
actor that's playing Null. Yeah. A lot of this
movie takes place in Las Vegas. I bet you that's

152
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,074
where the climax of the film is going to be.
And there's this weird scene where Eddie and

153
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:58,975
Venom steal a disguise from some guy wearing
a suit. I don't know what's going on here in

154
00:13:58,995 --> 00:14:03,238
the scene. It almost looks like Eddie pees on
him before Venom slaps the shit out of him.

155
00:14:03,358 --> 00:14:08,461
The guy pees on Eddie. Is that what happens?
Yeah. Who the hell does that? That's so fucking

156
00:14:08,501 --> 00:14:13,865
weird. I hate that. Right. But also I hate it
because Venom can change his appearance to

157
00:14:13,905 --> 00:14:18,008
match other clothing anyway. So why do they
need to steal this guy's clothes? Doesn't make

158
00:14:18,048 --> 00:14:23,112
sense. Maybe they just stole a key or something
like that. There was a whole section here where

159
00:14:23,192 --> 00:14:27,887
Venom is gambling and discovers the joys of.
gambling and the addictive quality to it that

160
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:33,032
I didn't need in a trailer. We'll say that could
have been a funny and I put funny in quotes,

161
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:37,695
gag for the movie. Didn't need to be in the
trailer. Just wasted time. No, it was dumb.

162
00:14:37,816 --> 00:14:42,299
I never related to that feeling to begin with.
Anytime I put money in a slot machine, it just

163
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:49,685
goes right away. And I'm like, Oh, this is like,
fuck. But no, I mean, the film, I think shows

164
00:14:49,745 --> 00:14:55,746
promise the inclusion of Null, the relationship
between Eddie and Venom. I think that all looks

165
00:14:55,786 --> 00:15:01,348
fantastic. Those things alone are propping up
my expectations for this film. I'm hoping at

166
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:05,989
least it'll be better than Venom Let There Be
Carnage, and I'm hoping it's as good as the

167
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:10,791
first Venom film. But we'll find out in just
over a month when this movie comes out on October

168
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:16,233
25th. But with this trailer teasing that this
may be the last appearance of Venom, that brings

169
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:17,573
us to our question of the week.

170
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:26,974
Do you think this should or shouldn't be Eddie
Brock's and Venom's last appearance in Sony's

Be sure to answer before September 21st. But

176
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:57,183
speaking of the Sony Spider-Man universe, we
also learned this past week that Destin Daniel

177
00:15:57,203 --> 00:16:03,645
Cretton is in talks to direct Spider-Man 4.
Now Destin Daniel Cretton is the director behind

178
00:16:03,825 --> 00:16:09,506
the Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings
film and the upcoming Wonder Man series. And

179
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:15,388
Marvel loves this guy. He's a fantastic director.
I really loved the Shang-Chi film. And I'm

180
00:16:15,448 --> 00:16:20,409
actually really excited about this news because
I think he can knock Spider-Man 4 out of the

181
00:16:20,449 --> 00:16:26,232
park. The one downside to this is that it means
that a Shang-Chi sequel is likely going to

182
00:16:26,252 --> 00:16:32,195
be put on a back burner, which breaks my heart
because that franchise deserves better. Yeah,

183
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:37,617
I'm actually really surprised we haven't received
a Shang-Chi sequel yet. I am happy for Destin

184
00:16:37,637 --> 00:16:41,279
Daniel Cretton though, considering the fact
that he was kicked off the upcoming Avengers

185
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:47,106
movie. This is not a terrible consolation. No,
you're absolutely right. Now- Shang-Chi the

186
00:16:47,146 --> 00:16:52,470
character was rumored to play a heavy part in
the King Dynasty film back when that was a

187
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:57,954
thing. Ever since the conviction of Jonathan
Majors and his subsequent firing from Marvel

188
00:16:57,994 --> 00:17:03,338
Studios, you know, they had to rework Avengers
the King Dynasty into Avengers Doomsday. And

189
00:17:03,358 --> 00:17:08,322
it's not quite sure if Shang-Chi is still going
to play a prominent role within that film because

190
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:13,065
Destin Daniel Cretton was originally attached
to direct the King Dynasty and it was stated

191
00:17:13,105 --> 00:17:17,849
that the film was going to be a quasi-sequel
for Shang-Chi, which is why they hadn't made

192
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:23,594
a whole lot of movement on a Shang-Chi sequel.
So now, because reports are saying that the

193
00:17:23,634 --> 00:17:27,897
Spider-Man movie is being fast-tracked, like
they're hoping to write the film and start

194
00:17:27,937 --> 00:17:32,021
shooting it as early as next year, Destin Daniel
Cran is not going to be able to get to Shang-Chi

195
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:36,705
for a while. My hope is that maybe they'll be
able to squeeze Shang-Chi into the Spider-Man

196
00:17:36,745 --> 00:17:42,001
4 film. since those characters have teamed up
in the comics before, and since the MCU Spider-Man

197
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:48,267
franchise has often included cameos from other
MCU heroes, such as Iron Man in Homecoming,

198
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:53,432
Nick Fury in Far From Home, and Doctor Strange
in No Way Home. Yeah, that'd be cool to get

199
00:17:53,452 --> 00:17:57,635
like a different cameo for each Spider-Man movie,
I like that. Yeah, the Spider-Man movies could

200
00:17:57,675 --> 00:18:02,940
almost be treated like the Marvel team-up comic
book series, which Spider-Man was often the

201
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:08,785
star teaming up with other. lesser known characters.
One of our executive producers, Devin Davis,

202
00:18:08,945 --> 00:18:15,050
had the idea that Spider-Man 4 would largely
focus on the Black Cat storyline since reports

203
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:18,853
are also saying that Zendaya is not going to
have a huge role in Spider-Man 4, which makes

204
00:18:18,914 --> 00:18:24,138
sense considering where they left the franchise
off in No Way Home. And I think introducing

205
00:18:24,178 --> 00:18:30,383
Black Cat is the next logical step for the franchise.
Devin Davis suggested that could mean that

206
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:35,279
she's working for Kingpin and then you could
have Daredevil be the superhero team up and

207
00:18:35,459 --> 00:18:40,782
I think I like that idea even more. So everything's
just looking bad for Shang-Chi. I feel bad

208
00:18:40,802 --> 00:18:46,866
for the actor Simu Liu because he was a great
Shang-Chi and I feel like he deserves better

209
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:52,189
than this deal that he's getting. Maybe by the
time they do make a Shang-Chi sequel, China

210
00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:58,213
will have calmed the F down and let that film
be released in their country. We'll see. One

211
00:18:58,253 --> 00:18:58,733
can only hope.

212
00:19:06,414 --> 00:19:10,399
That is it for all the news for this week, now
let's move on to the main event of this episode

213
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:18,469
when we review the Amazon exclusive DC animated
series, Batman Caped Crusader Season 1.

214
00:19:33,602 --> 00:19:39,046
Okay, Batman Kid Crusader is a new animated
series developed by Bruce Timm and produced

215
00:19:39,126 --> 00:19:46,393
by J.J. Abrams and Matt Reeves. It is a reimagining
of sorts of Bruce Timm's beloved animated series

216
00:19:46,673 --> 00:19:52,598
that us 90s kids used to watch every day after
school and on Saturday mornings. This series,

217
00:19:52,638 --> 00:19:59,424
however, is unhindered by concerns over network
marketability, allowing for a more mature psychological

218
00:19:59,524 --> 00:20:05,672
and progressive take. on the familiar characters
within the Batman mythos. And while I'd hesitate

219
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:10,895
to say it's an improvement upon the 90s series
in the same way that the recent X-Men 97 series

220
00:20:10,955 --> 00:20:16,739
was over that childhood favorite, Caped Crusader's
retro aesthetics and intriguing interpretations

221
00:20:16,859 --> 00:20:22,902
do make it a worthwhile and standout addition
to Batman's vast library of animated content.

222
00:20:23,343 --> 00:20:28,506
Since the primary appeal of the series really
is how it interprets its characters, If you

223
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:34,990
haven't seen the show and want to avoid spoilers,
stop listening now. Watch the show, then come

224
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:39,873
back and listen to our thoughts because we will
be delving into spoilers. Yeah, anyone who

225
00:20:39,893 --> 00:20:44,677
was a fan of the 90s Batman, the animated series
cartoon, I think owes it to themselves to check

226
00:20:44,697 --> 00:20:50,040
this show out. But I think it goes even harder
into the hardboiled elements of the Batman

227
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,900
comics when they first came out. Oh absolutely,
for sure. It's much more in that classic noir

228
00:20:56,060 --> 00:21:02,063
style. It's very hard boiled, very stripped
down, very classic Batman, which is nice. Now

229
00:21:02,103 --> 00:21:07,626
I wouldn't say this is a must-see Batman series
though. The main appeal of it isn't necessarily

230
00:21:07,686 --> 00:21:13,689
Batman, but the creators behind the show. From
Bruce Timm's classic design and strong storytelling

231
00:21:13,749 --> 00:21:18,935
sense, to J.J. Abrams' talent for bringing new
life to established properties, to Matt Reeves'

232
00:21:18,955 --> 00:21:24,158
gritty and realistic understanding of the character
evidenced in his 2022 film, The Batman, to

233
00:21:24,178 --> 00:21:29,260
the involvement of some of the comic industry's
best writers in Ed Brubaker and Greg Rucka.

234
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,002
Fans knew this was going to be something special,
going all the way back to 2014's Strange Days

235
00:21:35,122 --> 00:21:40,705
animated short that Bruce Timm made for Batman's
75th anniversary, which served as a launchpad

236
00:21:40,805 --> 00:21:45,963
for this series' visual aesthetic. Can I just
say that when I saw the names behind the show,

237
00:21:45,983 --> 00:21:49,845
because I had no idea, right? I knew that Bruce
Timm was behind the show, but I didn't know

238
00:21:49,966 --> 00:21:55,029
that Matt Reeves was producing. I think I knew
that JJ Abrams was producing, but that's still

239
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:59,431
a huge name to see for this cartoon. And then
all of a sudden I saw Ed Brubaker and Greg

240
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:03,294
Rucka, and I'm like, what the fuck is this?
Is this gonna be the best show of all time?

241
00:22:03,574 --> 00:22:11,054
Right? Man, I was truly impressed by the names
behind this series. 110%. I'd go so far as

242
00:22:11,094 --> 00:22:16,440
to say that between the creators involved and
the success of X-Men 97 and my excitement over

243
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:21,445
the show's mid-20th century design approach,
I thought this show was going to be the ultimate

244
00:22:21,525 --> 00:22:27,051
Batman series, and this is probably a solid
example of why you should temper your expectations

245
00:22:27,592 --> 00:22:32,237
going into any project involving a character
that's near and dear to your heart. It was

246
00:22:32,257 --> 00:22:38,411
just so d- different, not in a bad way, just
a mildly unsatisfactory way. A way I should

247
00:22:38,431 --> 00:22:42,332
have seen coming when they started revealing
things like their new take on Harley Quinn.

248
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:48,594
I didn't realize this show was going to be as
Elseworlds, for lack of a better word, as it

249
00:22:48,654 --> 00:22:54,496
was. Yeah, they changed a lot of things, right?
For better or for worse, I didn't mind a lot

250
00:22:54,536 --> 00:22:58,917
of the changes they had here, but I think we
could both agree that they fucked up the Penguin.

251
00:22:59,037 --> 00:23:04,424
You know, honestly? I did not hate their take
on the penguin. I thought I was going to. Some

252
00:23:04,444 --> 00:23:08,486
of the new takes that they did on the characters
that could be considered controversial because

253
00:23:08,526 --> 00:23:13,109
they race bent or gender bent the characters
like Barbara Gordon or the penguin, I didn't

254
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:18,552
mind. I was surprised I didn't hate Oswalda
the female penguin because it was well done,

255
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:24,815
I thought. That question of why was pretty much
cast aside once I understood the Elseworlds

256
00:23:24,895 --> 00:23:29,377
vibe of the show. I tend to be a little bit
more forgiving of how characters are handled.

257
00:23:29,682 --> 00:23:34,783
and else world stories like the doom that came
to Gotham or Red Sun, because I understand

258
00:23:34,843 --> 00:23:40,845
it's what if type nature. As a general rule,
I don't mind race bending or gender bending

259
00:23:41,065 --> 00:23:45,946
as long as, you know, they're true to the character.
But Oswalda Cobblepot was nothing like the

260
00:23:45,986 --> 00:23:49,267
Penguin as any of us know. It was almost an
entirely different character. She was like

261
00:23:49,287 --> 00:23:55,488
a big mama type mobster. Yeah, I've never seen
the Penguin do a song and dance number at the

262
00:23:55,569 --> 00:24:02,991
Iceberg Lounge. That was pretty wild. Cabaret
number. Oh, God. I bleach. But you know, expectations

263
00:24:03,052 --> 00:24:08,314
aside, I thought the show did a terrific job
at for the most part reintroducing us to familiar

264
00:24:08,354 --> 00:24:15,038
characters episode by episode. I was 100% tuned
in to each episode and eager for the next one

265
00:24:15,058 --> 00:24:20,681
in the same way I used to be watching the 90s
cartoon as a kid. I love film noir detective

266
00:24:20,701 --> 00:24:26,664
stories. I love mid 20th century design. I love
dark psychological examinations of characters.

267
00:24:27,125 --> 00:24:32,234
So yeah, this show hooked me. I watched the
entire thing in less than 24 hours. And like

268
00:24:32,294 --> 00:24:36,336
I said, I like what they did with a lot of the
characters. Not all of it worked like I would

269
00:24:36,356 --> 00:24:42,377
say on Amada Pia or the Robin characters, but
a lot of them like Clayface or Nocturna or

270
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:47,059
the Gentleman Ghost felt like they came straight
out of a Tales from the Crypt horror-esque

271
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:52,660
Elseworlds version of the DC universe. And keeping
your eye out for obscure cameos from characters

272
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,441
like Jim Corrigan or Floyd

273
00:24:57,558 --> 00:25:02,422
for sure. I really liked the anthological take
on this. While the series wasn't entirely anthological

274
00:25:02,442 --> 00:25:06,385
because you had the Harvey Dent through line,
a lot of these episodes were one-offs. Yeah,

275
00:25:06,405 --> 00:25:10,969
that's one thing I really liked about the old
90s cartoon was its anthological nature. For

276
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:15,233
the most part, every episode Batman would tackle
a new villain or a new conflict that would

277
00:25:15,253 --> 00:25:19,877
get wrapped up by the end of the episode. And
while this series did have some overarching

278
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:25,903
conflicts, It was more anthological than many
current shows. I'll always argue that long-form

279
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:30,604
storytelling is superior, and one of the reasons
I love the serialized nature of comic books.

280
00:25:30,924 --> 00:25:35,106
But there's something to be said for short,
quick stories as well. And this show definitely

281
00:25:35,186 --> 00:25:40,147
satisfied a nostalgic itch that I hadn't realized
I had. I mentioned that it was kind of fun

282
00:25:40,227 --> 00:25:45,229
looking out for obscure characters in this season.
That said, I would have much rather seen new

283
00:25:45,249 --> 00:25:49,979
takes on less obscure characters because...
I feel like those are kind of easy. I was much

284
00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:56,182
more impressed by this new take on Harley Quinn
than I was on, say, Gentleman Ghost. I think

285
00:25:56,202 --> 00:26:00,085
it would have been much more of a challenge
to come up with psychological rich takes on

286
00:26:00,105 --> 00:26:05,168
characters like Poison Ivy or Mr. Freeze. So
I'm looking forward to seeing them in subsequent

287
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:09,710
seasons, if they make them, you know, along
with the Joker, who at the end of this season

288
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,912
was teased in a man- manner, which...

289
00:26:15,614 --> 00:26:21,159
Yes, please. Back when Batman Begins came out,
which was a much more grounded, gritty take

290
00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:25,102
on the character in a way that audiences weren't
used to seeing because we were used to like

291
00:26:25,122 --> 00:26:30,547
the Schumacher films and stuff like that. Grounding
things in reality kind of became popular for

292
00:26:30,567 --> 00:26:36,012
a while. The ideas were if you take the character
and you remove the fantastical elements and

293
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:39,815
imagine what it would be like if this thing
actually existed in reality, that's what they

294
00:26:39,835 --> 00:26:44,046
did on this Caped Crusader show for the most
part. minus the supernatural episodes with

295
00:26:44,066 --> 00:26:49,488
the gentlemen ghost and the carnival and things
like that. It was really cool to see those

296
00:26:49,548 --> 00:26:54,509
ideas take shape in a more grounded, gritty
way. Because it totally fits the world of Batman.

297
00:26:54,729 --> 00:26:58,750
And yeah, I would love to see how they would
approach more fantastical characters like Poison

298
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:03,211
Ivy, like Mr. Freeze. I think that would be
really neat. Yeah, I really hope they do more

299
00:27:03,251 --> 00:27:07,833
seasons of this show because that would be amazing
to see. Now listeners of this podcast may have

300
00:27:07,853 --> 00:27:13,487
heard me complain about Bruce Tim's figure design.
I praised the Tomorrowverse for moving away

301
00:27:13,747 --> 00:27:18,831
from that Bruce Tim style and showing us something
less templated than decades past. This show

302
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:25,195
moves back toward that style, though it does
mix it up a little bit more than in the past.

303
00:27:25,536 --> 00:27:31,019
I actually didn't need chunkier versions of
characters like Renee Montoya or Harley Quinn.

304
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,943
It literally looked like they just took the
female character model and increased the width.

305
00:27:40,594 --> 00:27:45,858
Yeah, in a nostalgic way. But, you know, everything
just felt a little bit cleaner and more varied

306
00:27:46,038 --> 00:27:50,681
and a little bit more modern, too. I would definitely
agree that it looked cleaner. I thought it

307
00:27:50,741 --> 00:27:56,426
actually looked a little bit older in terms
of the design than the 90s series. Like the

308
00:27:56,906 --> 00:28:01,670
90s series had much more streamlined buildings,
I felt. And this one was a little bit more

309
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:07,134
vintage, I would say. Honestly, you know, I'm
spoiled after Suicide Squad, Isekai. Again,

310
00:28:07,234 --> 00:28:11,856
as we mentioned in that review, that was probably
the best animated work out of any animated

311
00:28:11,896 --> 00:28:19,200
DC project ever. So to go from that to this
was like, oh, more Bruce Tim. Yay. But I've

312
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,823
mentioned characters a lot. Let's go ahead and
move into our character breakdown, starting

313
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:30,407
with Batman Bruce Wayne. He was voiced by Hamish
Linklater, known for his work on the new adventures

314
00:28:30,427 --> 00:28:37,423
of Old Christine, Legion, Midnight Mass and
Manhunt. Don't think the dichotomy between

315
00:28:37,463 --> 00:28:42,926
his Bruce Wayne and Batman voice was as successful
as Kevin Conroy. I didn't think it was terrible

316
00:28:43,026 --> 00:28:48,229
either. His Batman voice sounded to me like
a mixture between Kevin Conroy's authoritative

317
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:54,193
approach and Christian Bale's growl. He did
a fantastic job. Now, most Batman animated

318
00:28:54,233 --> 00:29:00,637
voice actors are largely doing a Kevin Conroy
impression and this is no exception. I do think

319
00:29:00,817 --> 00:29:06,037
to that end, I... prefer other animated voices
like what Jensen Ackles did in the Tomorrowverse.

320
00:29:06,297 --> 00:29:10,941
Yeah, I would agree. But this was entirely passable.
I was impressed by the job that Hamish Linklater

321
00:29:10,961 --> 00:29:16,386
was able to do. I'd say like after Conroy, he's
my third or fourth favorite Batman voice. Yeah,

322
00:29:16,406 --> 00:29:20,709
that sounds about right. I do think that Hamish
Linklater would make a fantastic live-action

323
00:29:20,749 --> 00:29:25,193
Batman, considering the guy's a pretty good
actor. I would have much rather seen him as

324
00:29:25,253 --> 00:29:32,259
Bruce Wayne than fucking Ian Glenn in the Titan
series. Hahaha, yeah. It's occasionally a challenge

325
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:37,722
for writers to make Batman stand out against,
arguably, literature's most intriguing and

326
00:29:37,762 --> 00:29:43,446
colorful rogues gallery. This series definitely
suffers on that front. I felt like Batman actually

327
00:29:43,466 --> 00:29:48,210
got less screen time in each episode than I
thought he would, though honestly, maybe about

328
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:53,353
the same amount as the 90s cartoon. I'm not
100% on that. When he did appear though, they

329
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:57,816
made the most of his appearances, as stripped
down as the character was for the show. He

330
00:29:57,856 --> 00:30:02,474
wasn't big on martial arts, but he had a fair
number of gadgets and it was a decent showcase

331
00:30:02,494 --> 00:30:07,136
for his detective work. Well, I feel like they
could have maybe take it away from some of

332
00:30:07,196 --> 00:30:13,018
the screen time that the villains got each episode
in order to show more of his detective work

333
00:30:13,158 --> 00:30:19,520
processes. Absolutely, yeah, they could have
100%. The show hints that Bruce Wayne may be

334
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,381
as insane as his villains, you know, focused
less on justice and more on punishing criminals.

335
00:30:24,521 --> 00:30:28,839
As evidenced, when he lied to the police as
a kid saying he didn't see the face of the

336
00:30:28,879 --> 00:30:33,461
man who killed his parents. Followed by him
appearing in Alfred's room that night telling

337
00:30:33,621 --> 00:30:40,143
him that Gotham's criminals are all going to
suffer. I was like, dang! Get this kid a therapist.

338
00:30:41,124 --> 00:30:45,946
Exactly. But I also liked that approach for
the character. Like, Batman should be psychologically

339
00:30:46,006 --> 00:30:50,748
dark and traumatized. It was actually kind of
fascinating to me that Bruce Wayne didn't blink

340
00:30:51,028 --> 00:30:58,131
once this entire show. Wait, what? Really? Yeah.
Oh, creepy. Super, actually. Um, but I did

341
00:30:58,171 --> 00:31:02,053
like how this series showed that Bruce Wayne
is doing something to help Gotham besides punish

342
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:06,816
criminals though, like the new housing development
just outside the city, you know, it kind of

343
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:11,919
addresses the criticism that SNL made that he
just beats up poor people. Now he comes into

344
00:31:11,939 --> 00:31:16,702
conflict with Alfred consistently throughout
the show, calling him Pennyworth and talking

345
00:31:16,762 --> 00:31:22,426
back to him like a teenager would, Bruce is
definitely an angry person in the show. But

346
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:26,388
by the end of the season, he comes to realize
how much Alfred means to him and refers to

347
00:31:26,428 --> 00:31:32,093
him as Alfred for the first time. Speaking of
Alfred Pennyworth, he was voiced by Jason Watkins,

348
00:31:32,173 --> 00:31:37,496
who's a British television actor. I thought
he did a great job acting as a demure Alfred,

349
00:31:37,837 --> 00:31:43,281
who seems to be guilt-driven in the series into
being less of a father figure, as he's typically

350
00:31:43,321 --> 00:31:49,665
depicted, and more of an enabler, like he just
can't say no to Bruce. It's a fresh take on

351
00:31:49,725 --> 00:31:55,240
Alfred. and not one that I hated by any means,
because I can see it making sense for the character.

352
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,623
And he was still a good man and a good example,
ultimately, for Bruce. He was still trying

353
00:32:00,643 --> 00:32:05,506
to be as conscious. Alfred's always the one
trying to pull back Batman from the brink of

354
00:32:05,526 --> 00:32:11,889
the abyss. But here, with how early Bruce Wayne
started showing signs of psychosis, you would

355
00:32:11,929 --> 00:32:16,252
think that Alfred should have done a better
job of getting this kid some help. Because

356
00:32:16,432 --> 00:32:22,779
he seemed afraid, honestly, of Bruce Wayne.
Yeah. Right. I thought the same thing. Alright,

357
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:27,121
tackling Commissioner James Gordon and Barbara
Gordon simultaneously, they were voiced by

358
00:32:27,341 --> 00:32:33,543
Eric Morgan Stewart and Crystal Joy Brown respectively.
Barbara Gordon was reimagined as a lawyer for

359
00:32:33,563 --> 00:32:37,885
this series, which I thought was a brilliant
way to keep her story tied into her father's

360
00:32:38,025 --> 00:32:43,388
and Harvey Dent's. You know, Barbara is an idealist,
which often brings her into conflict with Commissioner

361
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:48,578
Gordon, who's more of a cynic, but one still
trying to help the city. Together, They make

362
00:32:48,598 --> 00:32:52,799
a pretty great pair, I thought, and I can't
wait to see how Barbara evolves into a costumed

363
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:58,682
crime fighter like Batman. If they decide to
go that route. Right. Yeah, they may not. Since

364
00:32:58,722 --> 00:33:03,304
this is still early days for Batman, he and
Commissioner Gordon aren't allies at the start

365
00:33:03,344 --> 00:33:08,486
of the show. But as the season progresses, Commissioner
Gordon realizes that Batman is trying to help,

366
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:13,489
particularly when they worked together to save
kids from a burning apartment building, which

367
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:18,023
was one of my favorite episodes in the series.
Yeah, I thought this is one of the most organic

368
00:33:18,103 --> 00:33:23,727
ways that I've seen them build up the Commissioner
Gordon Batman relationship outside of like

369
00:33:23,847 --> 00:33:30,071
Batman Year One, which was a great story. Yeah.
But like even in the Batman movie, Commissioner

370
00:33:30,111 --> 00:33:35,155
Gordon and Batman are already copacetic from
the get go, right? Right. It's nice to have

371
00:33:35,195 --> 00:33:39,918
this long running narrative where you see that
relationship of trust slowly develop. I thought

372
00:33:39,938 --> 00:33:43,500
it was really well done here. Yeah, I would
say it was better done here than it was in,

373
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:48,554
you know, even Batman Begins. much more organic,
like you said. Moving on to the last character

374
00:33:48,574 --> 00:33:53,776
I'm going to go over, Renee Montoya. She was
voiced by Michelle C. Bonilla. She does a lot

375
00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:58,317
of the heavy lifting when it comes to detective
work for the GCPD. I actually really liked

376
00:33:58,357 --> 00:34:02,678
how good of a detective she was shown to be,
you know, just by asking the right questions.

377
00:34:03,198 --> 00:34:07,480
She proves herself more and more as the season
progresses, confirming the trust that Commissioner

378
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:12,221
Gordon put on her to be a leader within the
corrupt police department. I actually thought

379
00:34:12,361 --> 00:34:16,611
that by introducing her in the Clayface episode,
that they were going to lead her into using

380
00:34:16,691 --> 00:34:21,515
some of the makeup putty to begin her like faceless
career as the question, but that ended up not

381
00:34:21,575 --> 00:34:25,017
being the case. That would have been cool though.
That would have been really cool.

389
00:35:19,438 --> 00:35:25,661
Moving on to the story highlights, episode 1
was titled In Treacherous Waters. Oswalda Cobblepot,

390
00:35:25,801 --> 00:35:30,424
owner and singer of the Iceberg Lounge, has
been making a name for herself in Gotham City's

391
00:35:30,464 --> 00:35:35,146
criminal underworld as the Penguin while trying
to eliminate her mob boss rival Rupert Thorne

392
00:35:35,486 --> 00:35:40,409
by destroying his organization's warehouses.
However, Thorne survives with help from a leak

393
00:35:40,449 --> 00:35:45,832
in her circle. Believing it is her youngest
son, Eren, Oswalda kills him. However, her

394
00:35:45,932 --> 00:35:51,395
eldest son, and the real source, Ronald, seeks
out Gotham City's police department, Commissioner

395
00:35:51,455 --> 00:35:56,238
James Gordon, for protection. With help from
Jim's daughter Barbara Gordon and a mysterious

396
00:35:56,278 --> 00:36:02,781
vigilante called the Batman, Ronald safely reaches
the GCPD, but Aswalda launches a missile to

397
00:36:02,821 --> 00:36:08,905
destroy the police station. Unbeknownst to her,
the station is evacuated before it is destroyed.

398
00:36:09,325 --> 00:36:14,828
Batman successfully captures Aswalda, but realizes
later that in doing so, he left a power vacuum

399
00:36:14,868 --> 00:36:19,706
in Gotham's underworld for Thorne to fill. This
was a great setup to the series, you know,

400
00:36:19,726 --> 00:36:24,729
with the whole power vacuum angle and the destruction
of the GCPD headquarters. I mean, it wasn't

401
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:30,271
too much of a issue in such like episodes, but
I thought that it was a really good setup.

402
00:36:30,651 --> 00:36:34,833
For sure. Yeah, I thought this was a great episode,
a great introduction to Batman when we first

403
00:36:34,853 --> 00:36:39,335
see him interrogating that guy over the train
tracks. Oh, yeah. I thought it was a perfect

404
00:36:39,355 --> 00:36:46,070
Batman moment, honestly. And I thought to myself,
is 1940s Batman peak Batman? when he's able

405
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:52,334
to operate freely in this very pulpy style?
Uh, you know, honestly, in my opinion, and

406
00:36:52,354 --> 00:36:58,799
this may be a controversial opinion, 1940s Batman,
Superman, Wonder Woman, that's all peak those

407
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:04,723
characters. Really? Explain. I feel like those
are like the truest essence of those characters.

408
00:37:05,143 --> 00:37:10,427
They kind of get muddled down by continuity
and stuff in later decades. But if you go back

409
00:37:10,467 --> 00:37:15,411
to like the spirit of the characters as they
were first conceived, I think that is the best

410
00:37:15,511 --> 00:37:20,015
version of them. I think you could say that
for a lot of characters actually, even over

411
00:37:20,035 --> 00:37:26,020
at Marvel. As the years go on and the characters
evolve over time, I think the expectation from

412
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:31,485
a lot of fans is that they always still revert
to their roots. And it's always nice when characters

413
00:37:31,505 --> 00:37:37,530
are brought back to what made them who they
are. Yeah, I mean, DC characters are so pure

414
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:43,855
in, you know, there's symbolism and their archetype
that Things don't really make sense in a postmodern

415
00:37:43,915 --> 00:37:49,458
world. These characters come from a different
era. And so you see comics like Watchmen kind

416
00:37:49,498 --> 00:37:56,122
of making fun of the very notion of the superhero.
But back then, it made sense. The next episode

417
00:37:56,142 --> 00:38:02,026
was titled, And Be a Villain. GCPD detective
Renee Montoya is assigned to locate missing

418
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:08,049
actress Yvonne Francis. Following a failed interrogation
of Bruce Wayne, she investigates the film studio.

419
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:13,892
where she learns Francis's fellow actor Basil
Carlo may have been lying about his alibi.

420
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:19,254
However, he is seemingly murdered before she
can confirm. Upon further investigation, she

421
00:38:19,294 --> 00:38:24,676
learns Carlo was ashamed of his face, which
led him to be typecasted and Francis rejecting

422
00:38:24,716 --> 00:38:31,159
his advances. Ultimately, he used an experimental
serum to make his face more malleable. Montoya

423
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:36,001
and Batman eventually stumble across Carlo,
who faked his death and kidnapped Francis out

424
00:38:36,041 --> 00:38:41,332
of a desire to play a villain for real. Montoya
rescues Francis while Batman defeats Carlo

425
00:38:41,732 --> 00:38:47,076
and disappears before Montoya can apprehend
him. Such a fantastic take on the character

426
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:51,038
of Clayface. I feel like, you know, Clayface
in recent years has really had an opportunity

427
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:57,363
to shine in shows like Harley Quinn or Suicide
Squad Isekai. But this is probably hands down

428
00:38:57,403 --> 00:39:03,727
my favorite version of the character. Taking
like a Boris Karloff approach to Basil Carlo

429
00:39:03,747 --> 00:39:10,022
Clayface was pure genius. Well, that's really
in keeping with his original story in the comic

430
00:39:10,042 --> 00:39:16,504
books, right? Very true. In the comics, Clayface
wasn't like this huge turd monster. He was

431
00:39:16,544 --> 00:39:20,746
actually just a serial killer who disguised
his face. This version of the character, I

432
00:39:20,766 --> 00:39:24,727
think, was the best of both worlds, though.
For sure. It is weird, though, seeing this

433
00:39:24,767 --> 00:39:30,148
version of Clayface coming off of the back of
Suicide Squad Isakai. Yeah. Who was a very,

434
00:39:30,528 --> 00:39:35,686
very different version of Clayface. Well, from
any media, to be fair. It's just interesting,

435
00:39:35,766 --> 00:39:40,328
I guess, how adaptable the character can be,
which I guess is not so surprising because

436
00:39:40,388 --> 00:39:46,210
he is clayface. He is adaptable, if anything.
Episode 3 was titled, Kiss of the Catwoman.

437
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:51,793
At a museum displaying Gotham's elite jewels,
Bruce encounters an heiress named Selena Kyle,

438
00:39:52,133 --> 00:39:57,175
who has an interest in his late mother Martha
Wayne's pearls. He is later ordered to attend

439
00:39:57,255 --> 00:40:01,977
a month of therapy with Dr. Harleen Quinzel
after assaulting a patron who insulted his

440
00:40:02,017 --> 00:40:08,778
parents. Kyle resorts to jewel theft after being
left in debt, adopting the Catwoman persona.

441
00:40:09,278 --> 00:40:13,842
After being caught and outed by Batman, she
takes inspiration from him by upgrading her

442
00:40:13,882 --> 00:40:19,266
car and using gadgets before Gotham's District
Attorney Harvey Dent bails her out, allowing

443
00:40:19,306 --> 00:40:24,791
her to resume her crime spree. Deducing Kyle
will try and steal Martha's pearls, Bruce orders

444
00:40:24,831 --> 00:40:30,175
the museum to close early to luring Catwoman,
who is eventually caught once more and left

445
00:40:30,215 --> 00:40:35,624
destitute upon learning her maid Greta. sold
her belongings and refuses to bail her out.

446
00:40:35,945 --> 00:40:41,730
I loved Greta. I loved the idea of Catwoman
having a butler like Alfred who's, you know,

447
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:47,596
kind of petty. That was great. This was a fantastic
episode. I really liked Christina Ricci's performance

448
00:40:47,656 --> 00:40:51,980
as Catwoman as well. The character design was
very much in keeping with her first appearance

449
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,723
in the comics and While there wasn't like enough
romantic tension, I think, between the two,

450
00:40:56,883 --> 00:41:00,845
I still really liked the moments that they shared
together. Now, it was actually the first appearance

451
00:41:00,865 --> 00:41:05,927
because the first appearance of Catwoman wore
an actual like cat's furry face, but it was

452
00:41:05,947 --> 00:41:11,270
definitely inspired by early versions of the
character. It's not a design that I love, but

453
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:16,312
it works within this world. Right. Like it doesn't
make sense for her to wear high heels and a

454
00:41:16,372 --> 00:41:22,559
dress. Right. Or a cape. That's bizarre. I did
like that she was very heavily inspired by

455
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:27,582
Batman though. It was a great version of the
character. Episode 4 was titled The Night of

456
00:41:27,622 --> 00:41:33,325
the Hunters. After Mayor Jessup orders the creation
of a task force to apprehend Batman, Gordon

457
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:39,888
chooses Montoya to run it. Using Dr. Quinzel's
insights, corrupt GCPD detectives Harvey Bullock

458
00:41:39,908 --> 00:41:46,172
and Arnold Flass use a masked criminal called
Firebug as bait to lure out Batman. As part

459
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:51,554
of their plan, they let Firebug go to start
a fire. Batman arrives to rescue civilians,

460
00:41:51,714 --> 00:41:56,716
evading corrupt SWAT officers led by Bullock
and Flass in the process. As Bullock and Flass

461
00:41:56,756 --> 00:42:03,077
kill Firebug to cover their tracks, Batman reluctantly
works with Jim, who disapproves of the task

462
00:42:03,097 --> 00:42:09,019
force's methods to save the remaining civilians.
Afterward, Batman disappears once more. Bullock

463
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:13,900
and Flass are hailed as heroes by Jessup and
put in charge of the Batman task force with

464
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:20,407
Jim narrowly keeping his job. I loved this episode.
I thought it was a fantastic episode showing

465
00:42:20,447 --> 00:42:27,012
the corruption of the GCPD, which isn't explored
enough in a lot of media, I feel like, but

466
00:42:27,132 --> 00:42:31,995
this show handled it perfectly. Oh yeah. Flash
and Bullock were probably bigger bastards in

467
00:42:32,035 --> 00:42:36,498
this show than they've been in anything else
I've ever seen them in. Yeah, they were big

468
00:42:36,538 --> 00:42:41,181
time jerks here. It was surprising to me how
much this show could get away with. People

469
00:42:41,221 --> 00:42:45,644
were actually shot, killed and stuff like that.
You couldn't get away with stuff like that

470
00:42:45,824 --> 00:42:51,709
in the 90s on television. But here it totally
worked. It's much more mature. And I thought

471
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:56,253
that made it a lot more interesting. Well, I
realized that from the first episode when Oswaldo

472
00:42:56,293 --> 00:43:01,057
killed one of her sons and then like you saw
his body as a skeleton coming out of the trunk

473
00:43:01,077 --> 00:43:05,942
later. That's right. Like this is pulpy as hell.
And I'm here for it. Oh, totally. We've been

474
00:43:05,962 --> 00:43:11,447
going to episode five. It was titled The Stress
of Her Regard. After several wealthy businessmen

475
00:43:11,527 --> 00:43:16,606
abruptly donate their fortunes to charity and
go missing. Barbara suspects their physician

476
00:43:16,726 --> 00:43:22,328
and her friend, Dr. Quinzel, is involved. In
reality, Quinzel has adopted the jester-like

477
00:43:22,368 --> 00:43:27,429
persona of Harley Quinn and is subjugating the
businessman to immense torture in an attempt

478
00:43:27,469 --> 00:43:31,930
to correct their minds and behavior. Barbara
and Batman track her to the basement of one

479
00:43:31,950 --> 00:43:36,451
of her patients, where the latter is overpowered
and knocked unconscious before the house is

480
00:43:36,551 --> 00:43:41,693
rigged to detonate. Nonetheless, Batman recovers
and saves Barbara, though he fails to save

481
00:43:41,733 --> 00:43:47,254
Quinzel from falling to her apparent death.
Having survived, however, Quinzel calls Montoya

482
00:43:47,534 --> 00:43:52,076
to call off a date they had planned and tell
her that she is temporarily leaving Gotham.

483
00:43:52,476 --> 00:43:58,178
Now, initially I was rejecting this take on
Harley Quinn. Like, I somewhat liked the idea

484
00:43:58,538 --> 00:44:05,099
that she was the resident psychiatrist for the
city as opposed to a doctor at Arkham Asylum.

485
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,121
But I didn't like the idea of Harley Quinn not
having the Joker. But by this episode, I was

486
00:44:11,141 --> 00:44:17,129
sold on the idea. The idea that the psychiatrist
was going beyond helping people who were coming

487
00:44:17,149 --> 00:44:22,493
to her and torturing them was amazing. It was
brilliant, I thought. And the fact that she

488
00:44:22,533 --> 00:44:27,177
kind of justified it and that they felt like
they were kings and that she was bringing them

489
00:44:27,237 --> 00:44:32,641
down as the Jester, making them see the error
of their ways was pretty damn good. It was

490
00:44:32,761 --> 00:44:37,424
solid as hell. As a concept, if you were ever
going to do Harley Quinn without the Joker,

491
00:44:37,845 --> 00:44:42,959
this is exactly how you do it. This is how you
get her motivations, her modus operandi. Everything

492
00:44:42,999 --> 00:44:47,401
about it was so interesting. We've seen lots
of different versions of Harley Quinn by this

493
00:44:47,441 --> 00:44:52,563
point. But this version is something that I
think even Kelly Kuoku's Harley Quinn could

494
00:44:52,583 --> 00:44:58,366
take notes from. Yeah. Because there's a lot
to unpack here. And they only just scratch

495
00:44:58,386 --> 00:45:03,028
the surface of what this Harley Quinn could
be in this show. I did hate the fact that Batman

496
00:45:03,048 --> 00:45:08,318
was essentially taken out by a dude in a diaper
in this series. I was like, no way. That's

497
00:45:08,358 --> 00:45:13,682
not going to happen. That's dumb. But for the
most part, I really liked this episode. The

498
00:45:13,882 --> 00:45:19,286
Lesbian Kiss kind of took me back, given the
1940s setting, 1950s setting, because it was

499
00:45:19,346 --> 00:45:24,491
done out in public. Right. That was just something
I was like, OK, so apparently this Elseworld

500
00:45:24,531 --> 00:45:29,234
story was just a much more progressive reality
for the time. It was one of the things that

501
00:45:29,274 --> 00:45:33,650
I think stood out in terms of all the progressive
changes that they made for the show. Yeah,

502
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:37,171
clearly. And again, something you definitely
couldn't get away with on Saturday mornings,

503
00:45:37,291 --> 00:45:43,074
kids television when we were growing up. Right.
Episode 6 was titled Night Ride. When a mysterious

504
00:45:43,154 --> 00:45:48,757
ghost on horseback emerges to rob Gotham's working
class, Dent's mayoral election campaign is

505
00:45:48,797 --> 00:45:54,399
threatened due to the robberies happening on
his watch. He is offered a donation from Thorne,

506
00:45:54,499 --> 00:46:00,238
but is hesitant to accept it. Meanwhile, Batman
struggles to fight the ghost directly. Deducing

507
00:46:00,278 --> 00:46:05,721
that it is the spirit of Jim Craddock, the gambling
addicted former owner of an old property that

508
00:46:05,741 --> 00:46:11,405
Bruce's friend Lucius Fox recently bought, he
gains help from Linton Midnight, Papa Midnight,

509
00:46:11,745 --> 00:46:17,128
who advises him to sacrifice the old property's
deed and the blood of a nobleman to draw out

510
00:46:17,168 --> 00:46:22,231
Craddock. Though Craddock possesses Batman's
butler, Alfred Pennyworth, Batman completes

511
00:46:22,251 --> 00:46:28,178
the ritual using Alfred's blood and traps Craddock
in a vial. He subsequently gives it to Midnight

512
00:46:28,278 --> 00:46:33,140
while Dent accepts Thorne's donation. It was
really cool to see Papa Midnight in this episode.

513
00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:37,382
There are any number of magicians that could
have been included in the show, and Papa Midnight

514
00:46:37,462 --> 00:46:41,024
would not have been near the top of my list
of who would have shown up. But I thought it

515
00:46:41,044 --> 00:46:46,746
was really cool that he did. Yeah, in the 90s
cartoon, we saw Jason Blood appear in the Batman

516
00:46:46,786 --> 00:46:52,128
series. And I think it was Dr. Fate who appeared
in the Superman series. I thought it was going

517
00:46:52,148 --> 00:46:56,926
to be one of those. I was definitely surprised
by Papa Midnight. but it was also really cool

518
00:46:57,307 --> 00:47:03,011
to see such an obscure character make an appearance
in the show. Moving on to episode 7, titled

519
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:08,034
Moving Target. Jim fears that someone put a
bounty on his head after assassins such as

520
00:47:08,094 --> 00:47:13,158
Floyd Lawton and Anomatopeia come to Gotham,
and the former almost succeeds at killing him.

521
00:47:13,538 --> 00:47:18,441
He reluctantly agrees to be escorted to a safe
house at Wayne Gardens, but Anomatopeia's group

522
00:47:18,482 --> 00:47:23,365
finds them. Meanwhile, Batman learns the hit
was placed by a Blackgate penitentiary inmate

523
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:28,779
named Muller, and follows Jim's detail. Narrowly
fending off the assassins, Berman reveals to

524
00:47:28,819 --> 00:47:34,561
Jim while getting the contract canceled, he
discovered Barbara is the true target. Officer

525
00:47:34,621 --> 00:47:40,082
Jim Corrigan attempts to claim the bounty for
himself, but is disarmed by Jim and arrested.

526
00:47:40,502 --> 00:47:45,744
Mueller later reveals he ordered the hit because
he feels he deserves better prison accommodations.

527
00:47:46,004 --> 00:47:51,382
This was a fantastic episode, another one of
my favorite episodes, very focused on- Jim

528
00:47:51,422 --> 00:47:56,386
Gordon and Barbara Gordon and their relationship,
which I thought was great. I didn't love on

529
00:47:56,406 --> 00:48:01,791
a monopoeia here. He doesn't make sense to me
as like a gang leader. He wouldn't be able

530
00:48:01,811 --> 00:48:06,896
to order anybody around. They would just see
him as a joke. Exactly. His voice didn't work

531
00:48:06,916 --> 00:48:11,540
for me, too. Like it was too raspy and stuff
like that. Like whenever I read on a monopoeia

532
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:16,665
his voice in the books, I always thought of
it as more like a Hannibal Lecter type voice.

533
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:21,075
Yeah. something like James Spader's Ultron or
something like that. But here he sounded like

534
00:48:21,135 --> 00:48:25,677
Bender from Futurama or something like that.
It just did not work. I did think it was cool

535
00:48:25,697 --> 00:48:30,999
that they had Jim Corrigan on the GCPD. I was
not expecting him. I actually thought he was

536
00:48:31,019 --> 00:48:35,561
going to die at the very end of this episode
and somehow be reborn as the specter or something

537
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:40,604
like that. That didn't happen. But you know,
they're setting him up for something like that.

538
00:48:41,044 --> 00:48:46,726
Yeah. But what a guy who double crossed his
own partner B1 that is. qualified to be God's

539
00:48:46,746 --> 00:48:50,967
divine wrath? Well, this isn't keeping with
the character from the comics. Like, Jim Corrigan

540
00:48:50,987 --> 00:48:56,689
was an asshole in the comics. Really? Oh, okay.
Yeah. Okay. Moving on to episode 8, titled

541
00:48:56,849 --> 00:49:02,510
Nocturne. Amidst a fundraiser carnival for Dent's
campaign, multiple orphans are reported missing.

542
00:49:02,871 --> 00:49:07,592
Batman soon finds the culprit, Natalia Knight,
the younger sister of inventor Anton Knight,

543
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:12,553
who suffers from a mysterious ailment that can
only be staved off by draining energy from

544
00:49:12,613 --> 00:49:17,628
people. which grants her enhanced strength.
After falling out with and attacking Anton

545
00:49:17,648 --> 00:49:22,551
for his perceived controlling behavior, Natalia
continues her attacks until she is intercepted

546
00:49:22,631 --> 00:49:28,454
by Batman. After making her realize she accidentally
killed Anton, who begged Batman to stop her

547
00:49:28,494 --> 00:49:33,557
before he died, Batman takes Natalia to safety
while her victims are taken to a hospital to

548
00:49:33,597 --> 00:49:38,660
recover. Meanwhile, Dent meets with Thorne to
accept his donation, but refuses to accept

549
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:45,624
his condition of dropping charges against Thorne's
friend. retaliation, Thorin II throws a flask

550
00:49:45,664 --> 00:49:52,970
of acid at Dent's face. This is actually probably
my least favorite episode. Really? Yeah, I

551
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:57,654
felt like the whole thing kind of drug on. I
didn't really care for the characters of Natalia

552
00:49:57,674 --> 00:50:02,498
and Anton Knight. They're known as the Knight
Slayer and Nocturna in the comics. But I think

553
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:08,623
I was most offended in this episode by how they
treated the Robins. I was kind of hoping for

554
00:50:08,663 --> 00:50:15,639
a setup of Robin in this series. And I think
this is a poor setup. Well, it seems like it's

555
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:20,421
never going to happen, right? Right. We're never
going to get a Robin in this series. When one

556
00:50:20,441 --> 00:50:24,223
of the boys referred to the other one as Dickie,
I was like, oh, maybe this is Dick Grayson.

557
00:50:24,643 --> 00:50:29,065
I actually thought that maybe that was just
a coincidence when I saw that Dick was captured

558
00:50:29,185 --> 00:50:33,847
and nearly drained of his life. But then it
wasn't until they mentioned Steffi Brown that

559
00:50:33,887 --> 00:50:38,549
I realized what they were doing with the orphans.
Oh, you didn't get it when you heard Jace for

560
00:50:38,609 --> 00:50:43,400
Jason? No, not even then. And then of course
they had Kelly at the end with the slingshot.

561
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:48,244
Right. That was obvious. Yeah, for sure. It
was like a nice elseworlds homage. But yeah,

562
00:50:48,584 --> 00:50:54,389
it is disappointing that because of this seemingly
clever nod to the comics that will actually

563
00:50:54,429 --> 00:50:59,173
never get a Robin for this series. Yeah, it's
like either he's going to have five Robins

564
00:50:59,233 --> 00:51:04,837
at once or I imagine none at all. Did not like
it. I was surprised we didn't get like Tim

565
00:51:05,178 --> 00:51:10,194
or Damien. I guess Damien would it make sense.
But at least Tim. Actually, Damien. could make

566
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:15,316
sense if they introduce Russell Gould and Talia
in a subsequent season. And they just have

567
00:51:15,376 --> 00:51:20,778
Damian be his first Robin. Yeah, I guess they
could go with that. Moving on to episode 9,

568
00:51:20,859 --> 00:51:26,221
The Killer Inside Me. In the aftermath of his
assault, Dent loses his mayoral bid and is

569
00:51:26,281 --> 00:51:31,503
left with half of his face permanently scarred,
which he grows insecure about. Bruce attempts

570
00:51:31,523 --> 00:51:36,125
to cheer him up with a night on the town, but
a paranoid Dent has an outburst in a restaurant.

571
00:51:36,746 --> 00:51:41,488
Alfred scolds Bruce for his poor attempt at
getting through to him. Craving justice against

572
00:51:41,568 --> 00:51:46,411
those who wronged him, Dent goes on a violent
spree throughout Gotham, taking out several

573
00:51:46,471 --> 00:51:52,295
of Thorne's men, though Batman intervenes before
he can hurt Thorne himself. Guilt-ridden, Dent

574
00:51:52,375 --> 00:51:57,258
snaps out of his rage and willingly goes to
Arkham Asylum, where he discovers Barbara signed

575
00:51:57,318 --> 00:52:02,821
on to become his lawyer. I liked what they did
with Harvey Dent for the most part throughout

576
00:52:02,881 --> 00:52:09,851
this season. I did think that his descent into
madness was a little out of nowhere though.

577
00:52:10,231 --> 00:52:14,872
Like the voices in his head, they just seem
to come along with the scarring of his face.

578
00:52:15,152 --> 00:52:19,274
Well, isn't that true to the story of the character?
Like he doesn't begin his descent into madness

579
00:52:19,334 --> 00:52:25,375
until he's actually scarred. No, he essentially
repressed a alternate personality as he was

580
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:30,437
growing up, becoming a lawyer. Like in this
show, he didn't really even depend on his old

581
00:52:30,497 --> 00:52:36,335
coin in the same way that he has in prior depictions.
I don't know, it was just weird. I loved Diedrich

582
00:52:36,395 --> 00:52:41,978
Bader as the voice of Harvey Dent. I thought
he sounded completely different from when he

583
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:48,202
voices Batman in shows like Harley Quinn. But
to me, this version of Harvey Dent is not as

584
00:52:48,242 --> 00:52:54,146
good as other depictions that we've seen in
animated films like The Long Halloween or his

585
00:52:54,186 --> 00:52:59,489
live action appearance in The Dark Knight. He
was just too smarmy as Harvey Dent. He wasn't

586
00:52:59,529 --> 00:53:04,352
the shining white knight. that he's typically
depicted as prior to becoming Two-Face. I guess

587
00:53:04,372 --> 00:53:10,017
that makes sense. I thought it was really interesting
how Bruce was essentially responsible for his

588
00:53:10,057 --> 00:53:16,662
descent into madness by forgetting to focus
on the victim and having empathy for him. He

589
00:53:16,702 --> 00:53:21,106
had no empathy. He was just trying to get at
the people who did it and in effect caused

590
00:53:21,146 --> 00:53:26,430
Harvey Dent to go on this crazy rampage. I didn't
really get that. I didn't understand how taking

591
00:53:26,470 --> 00:53:32,523
him out to dinner caused him to have his episode.
Bruce didn't know that was going to happen.

592
00:53:32,563 --> 00:53:38,007
I'm sure he had ulterior motives in doing that,
but I also felt like it's also something a

593
00:53:38,207 --> 00:53:43,630
good friend might try doing. And I think Harvey
even later on said that he understood what

594
00:53:43,671 --> 00:53:47,954
Bruce was trying to do while both of them were
talking in Arkham Asylum. Which brings me to

595
00:53:47,994 --> 00:53:52,777
the final episode titled Savage Night. Barbara
explains to Dent that she is willing to help

596
00:53:52,817 --> 00:53:58,761
him, insisting that he was led astray. Meanwhile,
Thorn's men, Bullock and Flass, seek revenge

597
00:53:58,781 --> 00:54:03,803
on Dent. prompting Barbara and Batman to establish
a form of contact between each other and join

598
00:54:03,843 --> 00:54:09,644
forces with each other, Jim and Montoya to protect
him so he can testify in court. Amidst a fight

599
00:54:09,684 --> 00:54:15,346
at the docks, however, Dent sacrifices himself
to save Barbara from Flass. Batman loses his

600
00:54:15,386 --> 00:54:20,908
temper and threatens to shoot Flass, but ultimately
spares him. Following this, Alfred assures

601
00:54:20,968 --> 00:54:27,878
Batman that while he failed to reach Dent's
humanity, Batman still has his. A mysterious

602
00:54:27,938 --> 00:54:33,341
man kills a series of victims with a toxin that
makes them laugh uncontrollably. Great final

603
00:54:33,361 --> 00:54:38,724
episode. I really liked the pacing of it. It's
mostly a chase scene between the good guys

604
00:54:38,744 --> 00:54:43,907
and the bad guys. Yeah, yeah. The finale at
the docks was really well done and even surprising

605
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:48,950
at the very end when Batman holds a gun up to
flash and shoots around his head. Although

606
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:54,893
100% doing permanent ear damage as well, I'm
pretty sure. That's fine. He doesn't have a

607
00:54:54,953 --> 00:55:00,340
problem with that. No, he doesn't. In fact,
if anything, it was showed that Batman was

608
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:05,483
such a badass with a gun and he has still refused
to do it out of hatred for the weapon. I thought

609
00:55:05,503 --> 00:55:09,965
that was an interesting insight to his character
actually that he took the time to understand

610
00:55:10,045 --> 00:55:14,047
this weapon that he despises. Yeah, that was
interesting. I always kind of assumed that

611
00:55:14,087 --> 00:55:18,250
Batman really didn't even know how to use a
gun. You know, he just hated them so much.

612
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:24,253
So yeah, again, this was pretty shocking. Even
more shocking than that was actually Harvey

613
00:55:24,273 --> 00:55:30,339
Dent's death. in this season, in this series,
sacrificing himself to save Barbara. The whole

614
00:55:30,479 --> 00:55:36,021
is he good, is he bad approach to Harvey Dent
in this season was really well done. I thought

615
00:55:36,061 --> 00:55:39,902
because, you know, the last episode, we saw
him essentially go on a murder spree. But in

616
00:55:39,942 --> 00:55:45,483
this episode, to see him sacrifice himself for
Barbara Gordon, I thought was extremely heroic

617
00:55:45,823 --> 00:55:49,905
and definitely redeeming for the character.
Like you were sad to see him go. Do you think

618
00:55:49,965 --> 00:55:54,366
they have shot themselves in the foot in terms
of the potential? two-faced stories they could

619
00:55:54,386 --> 00:56:00,749
have told in the future? Potentially, but outside
of the fall of Harvey Dent, there's not too

620
00:56:00,769 --> 00:56:06,131
many great two-faced stories that you could
tell, so maybe it's for the best. Maybe use

621
00:56:06,171 --> 00:56:11,873
this as a way to fuel and motivate Batman going
forward, the fact that he remembers his friend

622
00:56:11,913 --> 00:56:17,536
Harvey Dent. But that does it for season one
of Batman the Caped Crusader. Overall, I thought

623
00:56:17,556 --> 00:56:23,602
it was a mature and intriguing reimagining of
the 90s animated series. featuring new and

624
00:56:23,662 --> 00:56:29,786
modern interpretations of classic characters
within a retro noir framework. Not every interpretation

625
00:56:29,906 --> 00:56:34,228
is successful and it would have been nice to
see Batman a little bit more than we did. But

626
00:56:34,328 --> 00:56:38,390
overall, I definitely recommend the series,
especially for the people who are behind it.

627
00:56:38,891 --> 00:56:45,834
I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars, a fresh rating
on Rotten Tomatoes. I would agree. I think

628
00:56:45,874 --> 00:56:51,842
the setup and the premise of the series is better
than the execution for the most part. Don't

629
00:56:51,862 --> 00:56:55,543
get me wrong, it was a really good show. It
was enjoyable and I would recommend it to any

630
00:56:55,583 --> 00:57:01,666
fan of Batman and any fan of Batman the animated
series. But it does feel like for some episodes,

631
00:57:01,986 --> 00:57:06,027
they squandered their potential. Even though
I had a really good time with the series and

632
00:57:06,067 --> 00:57:10,089
I'm really looking forward to where they take
it in the future. Oh, yeah, absolutely. I'm

633
00:57:10,109 --> 00:57:13,710
not sure if they're doing a season two, but
I really hope they are. I would love to see

634
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:20,433
it. But that does it for this review. AJ 9K,
