1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:39,680
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. I'm Marvellous
Joe and I'm his twin brother Johnny DC. And in this

2
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,420
episode, after taking a quick detour into the
Mortal Kombat vs. Street Fighter realm, we're

3
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,940
coming back to Marvel vs. DC and finding out who
would win in a fight between the rodent themed

4
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:57,060
characters of Ratcatcher and Squirrel Girl. And I
should note right off the bat that her name is the

5
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:01,180
unbeatable Squirrel Girl. So Jonathan, if you
think you're winning this episode, you're going

6
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:06,660
to get beat. What do you mean, like in real life or in
the match? I mean, in real life. Oh, no. For having

7
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:13,500
such a bad opinion. Yeah, Ratcatcher is probably
most famous for being in the Suicide Squad film

8
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,960
directed by James Gunn. But in the comics, the
character actually hasn't been around that long.

9
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,080
Like he doesn't have too many appearances. Same
with Squirrel Girl, actually. She debuted in the

10
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,800
90s and then had a few appearances, didn't appear
for like 10 years until Great Lakes Avengers and

11
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:33,000
then really came to the forefront in the recent
Marvel Rivals video game. So we're going to get all

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,540
into her history and Ratcatcher's history later
on this episode. But before that, we're going to

13
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,620
break down the latest comic book movie news to come
out this past week, of which we got two news items.

14
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:47,920
First one being the Superman sneak peek and the
other one being the new title reveal for the

15
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,100
Spiderman four film. Yeah, both of these news
items came out of CinemaCon, which is like Comic

16
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,000
Con, but for movies. As always, we list our segment

29
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,460
between popular video game characters. In
yesterday's episode, they speculated who would

30
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:12,500
win in a fight between Little Mac from Punch Out
against Balrog from Street Fighter, who's a

31

boxing episode. And over on the Max Destruction

the 1994 film Street Fighter the Movie. And on the

34
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:33,540
Senjo World podcast, host Zachary Hepburn
speculates on fights between fan favorite anime

35
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:38,760
and manga characters. On Thursday, Zach's going

38
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:59,460
of the way, quick to the no prize. A no prize is an
award that Marvel used to give out to fans. Our

39
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:04,740
version, the Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital
award we post on Instagram for the person that we

40
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:10,160
feel gave the best answer to our question of the
week. Last week, we asked you guys which character

41
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,900
not announced for Avengers Doomsday, which you
most like to have seen and why. And of course, this

42
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:22,140
is coming off of the cast reveal for Avengers
Doomsday that came out a few weeks ago. We got a few

43
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:27,840
answers, just three it looks like. So we have two
honorable mentions and one no prize winner. Our

44
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:35,020
first honorable mention goes to Mike Williams.
Who said? Hi guys. Mike Williams here. The person

45
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:41,280
that was not announced. I would like to say Michael
fast vendor, the younger Magneto. I can't see Dr.

46
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,960
Dooms pulling off all this mayhem against all
these heroes that I will help. And then maybe the

47
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:53,140
younger Magneto turn on them at the end of the movie
as always make my model. Check out. Yeah, we got to

48
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:58,380
reveal that some of the X-Men characters from the
original Fox franchise are going to be in Avengers

49
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:04,460
Doomsday, including Patrick Stewart as
Professor X in McKellen as Magneto. James Marsden

50
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:10,860
as Cyclops, etc. We did not receive word that any of
the new cast of characters from the rebooted

51
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,600
timeline, starting with X-Men first class, is
going to show up. So characters like James

52
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:22,140
McAvoy's Professor X or Michael fast benders,
Magneto, are not going to appear. Possibly,

53
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:26,540
allegedly. We'll see if they end up showing up on
the cast list. But those actors will be sorely

54
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,840
missed, especially Michael fastbender as
Magneto, who really came to define the character

55
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,000
on his own, apart from Ian McKellen's version.
Yeah, what duo did it better, Patrick Stewart and

56
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,440
Ian McKellen or James McAvoy and Michael
fastbender? I can't choose. They were both great.

57
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:48,760
Gun to your head, gun to your balls. I guess I would
go with James McAvoy and Michael fastbender, just

58
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:54,640
because I think they brought just as much gravitas
to the roles as the elder actors. But they brought

59
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:59,740
this cool factor that wasn't quite as prevalent.
That's probably blasphemy. I don't feel good

60
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,700
about that answer. It's a fucked up question. It's
a fucked up question. Yeah, I mean, you gave the

61
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:10,240
wrong answer to because there really is no right
answer to that question. Right, right. Great

62
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,840
answer, Michael Williams. Our next honorable
mention goes to Travis Bailey. Who said? Travis

63
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,660
from that town. What's up there, twin? All right,
so we spoke about it. Give me Haley Stanfield's

64
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,160
Potter Twin. I know this dove, Cameron. I can see
the vision there. I'm cool with that. I see the

65
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:33,120
vision. Or give me Dallas Dupre Young and Cobra Kai
as Miles Morales. Now, you got something there. He

66
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,320
laying hands on cats like here, Reverend, like he
like he under the revival tent. Man, because we

67
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,720
don't have that iconic spider-man fighting scene
like we got from Derrick Devil and Vassal. Yeah,

68
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:49,680
Travis gave two answers here. He said either Haley
Stanfield as Gwen Stacy. Of course, she voices the

69
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,820
character of Gwen Stacy in the Spider-Verse
animated films or Dallas Dupre Young as Miles

70
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:01,340
Morales. And I agree with both of those answers.
Haley Stanfield, I think is a little bit older than

71
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,820
Dallas Dupre Young. And, you know, of course,
Dallas doesn't voice Miles in the Spider-Verse

72
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,460
films. That's Shamique Moore. I also think you'd
be a great Miles Morales. But I think you do want to

73
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:16,680
cast pretty dang young like teenager aged for
Miles and Spider-Gwen if they were to show up.

74
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,360
Yeah, honestly, if you could get Haley Stanfield
to cameo as Gwen Stacy and Shamique Moore to cameo

75
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,620
as Miles Morales, that would be perfection. But
Dallas Dupre Young as Miles Morales is something

76
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,080
I'd never considered. I think if you're going to
get him as Miles Morales, though, you shouldn't do

77
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:38,480
Haley Stanfield as Gwen Stacy. You should cast
another Cobra Kai actress, maybe Peyton List to be

78
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,860
her, because I think she would be great in that role
as well. Yeah, that'd be awesome. But I'm also

79
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,880
hoping that they save the Spider-Verse
characters for the Spider-Man films. Great

80
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:53,180
answer, Travis. But the winner of this week's No
Prize is Gil Camacho. Who said? Hey, guys, Gil

81
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:59,100
Lee-Macho here. You know, all jokes aside, my
answer would have been Mark Ruffalo, but I think we

82
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:05,700
should give that guy a break. So my answer is going
to be Edward Norton, Bruce Banner, aka The Hulk. I

83
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:12,800
think we need a more serious, more savage version
of The Hulk, and he could be a variant of Bruce

84
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:19,460
Banner. And I think I would get a kick out of him
interacting with the thing. So that's my answer,

85
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:24,560
Edward Norton. Yeah, it was a huge disappointment
that The Hulk was not mentioned as one of the cast

86
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,520
members for the upcoming Avengers Doomsday film.
It seems more like the character is going to be

87
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,940
saved for the sequel Avengers Secret Wars. That
being said, considering we're getting like all of

88
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:42,679
the old Fox X-Men characters in Doomsday, it would
also be interesting to see how a variant of Mark

89
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:47,820
Ruffalo's Bruce Banner, Edward Norton, would
interact with everybody else if he were to show up

90
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:51,500
in Avengers Doomsday. And it would be even more
interesting if Mark Ruffalo actually was in the

91
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:55,140
film when we got to see his Bruce Banner's
interaction with Edward Norton's Bruce Banner

92
00:08:55,140 --> 00:09:00,420
and also maybe get some interaction between the
thing and one of the Hulk's. I just think there's a

93
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:06,220
lot of potential to kind of get some closure with
the character of Edward Norton's Bruce Banner if

94
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,480
you were included in this film. I mean,
technically Edward Norton is not a variant,

95
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:16,040
though, but it would be cool if this film cleared
that up and bring back Terrence Howard as well.

96
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,900
Yeah, just everybody who is recast in any of these
films, just have them show up in Avengers Doomsday

97
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:27,180
as variants. And then we could just, you know, all
understand how the recasting happens and

98
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,520
continuity and stuff like that. Although, I guess
you couldn't do that with William Hurt. Just CGI

99
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,400
him. Just do a Princess Leia. Yeah, that'll work.
That'll work. But no, I love this answer. I think if

100
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,800
you guys listen to our review of the Incredible
Hulk, you're aware of just how big a fan I was of

101
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,040
Edward Norton as Bruce Banner. It's kind of a shame
that, you know, he wasn't able to retain the role,

102
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,560
but I'm still really glad that we got Mark Ruffalo
as the character now. It would just be nice for him

103
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:55,720
to actually show up in this movie. Great answer,
Gilly. You win this week's No Prize if you're the

104
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,980
listener who won a shot at winning your own No
Prize. Stay tuned to later on in this episode when

105
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:11,220
we'll be asking another question of the week.
Another that's done. On to the news. OK, last week

106
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,260
during CinemaCon, the Warner Brothers panel
unveiled what they're calling a sneak peek. It's

107
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:22,180
really an extended trailer of Superman. There's
not too much new footage from the previous

108
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:28,520
trailer, except for an extended opening
involving crypto and Superman by the fortress of

109
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:34,340
solitude. Now, this was initially only supposed
to be played in theaters as a theatrical exclusive

110
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:39,700
for the first time in a while. For anyone who went to
go see the Minecraft movie, you know, CinemaCon is

111
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:46,040
for movies, but it's specifically for theaters.
Like theaters go there and see what new films the

112
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,940
studios are going to bring out. So I'm not
surprised that Warner Brothers was trying to

113
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:55,500
throw theaters a bone by not releasing this
online. That said, it eventually was rumors are

114
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,620
because it was leaked, but I don't remember seeing
it leaked anywhere. Thank you, goodness. They did

115
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:05,060
release this online, though, because I am not
interested in the Minecraft movie. I know people

116
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:11,500
like that. Never played it as a kid. It kind of was
too old to play it by the time it became popular. But

117
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,340
yeah, I'm glad I got to see this trailer. Yeah, but
did it really drum up any hype for the Superman film

118
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:24,260
that wasn't already there? Probably not, I'll be
honest. In fact, it probably hurt the film because

119
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:29,000
there's been a lot of criticism specifically
regarding crypto. Now, when the trailer starts

120
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,120
off, Superman, of course, lands near the North
Pole as he did in the previous trailer. And he

121
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:39,540
whistles for crypto, who comes and immediately
just starts jumping all over him. It's like a

122
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,560
really bad dog. And the first time I saw this
trailer, I was like, what the heck? Is crypto

123
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,840
really hurting Superman that much? Like is crypto
stronger than Superman? I was just confused. But

124
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:56,380
after watching it like 50 times, I was like, OK,
Superman's hurt. His dog's being a bad dog and just

125
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:02,100
jumping all over him. It didn't bother me as much.
No, it didn't bother me the first time I saw it. I

126
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,640
just figured that it was a scene that's being
played for laughs, which was a little bit strange

127
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:13,740
to me because seeing the shot of Superman in the
snow injured like that seemed very serious in its

128
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,580
tone from the first trailer. And then we see that
the tone is actually more comedic when crypto

129
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,900
shows up and then starts essentially beating the
shit out of Superman. So we're having this tonal

130
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,140
disparity that's something more akin to a Marvel
film, I think, than anything we've seen come out of

131
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:34,240
DC, you know, with Peacemaker. And the Suicide
Squad accepted. Yeah, I'm still trying to figure

132
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:41,440
out if this would be considered bathos or. Sure, of
course it would. Maybe because I think one of the

133
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,700
big recurring themes of the movie is how bad of a dog
crypto is. So maybe not. I'm not sure. I mean, that

134
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:53,460
being said, I don't mind crypto being portrayed as
like this problem dog because I think it's

135
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:59,280
endearing. You know, I think most people who have
had a dog who needed to undergo training or just had

136
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:05,340
some behavioral issues knows where this is coming
from and can kind of relate to it and find it

137
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:10,360
endearing and stuff like that. And I think it'll be
an interesting story element to explore for

138
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,000
Superman dealing with this all powerful dog,
basically. I don't think that's going to be the

139
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,260
main plot of the movie, but I think it's an
interesting subplot. I was confused, though, as

140
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:25,820
to the state of crypto's training, because on one
hand you have him jumping all over Superman

141
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:29,960
wanting to play with him and, you know, injuring
him. And then on the other hand, you have him

142
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:35,080
actually listening to Superman and carrying him
directly to the fortress of solitude. So like,

143
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:40,200
does he obey orders or does he not obey orders?
Like, make up your mind. I think he was just really

144
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:45,960
excited to see his owner. But then when he realized
that, oh, hey, things are pretty serious. I should

145
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:53,140
probably listen to him. That's the vibe that I got.
OK, so he is trained then. Ish, probably not well.

146
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:59,100
OK, like, don't make him a service dog is what
you're saying. Definitely not. Now crypto drags

147
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:05,920
Superman to the fortress of solitude, which holy
shit was incredible. Like the whole opening scene

148
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,200
that we have here for this trailer looks gorgeous.
That was not expected for how cool the fortress of

149
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,620
solitude was going to look in this film. It's by far
the best realized version of the fortress of

150
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,320
solitude that I think I've ever seen. The
cinematography of this movie, I think, is going to

151
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,800
be incredible. I mean, based off these trailers,
yeah, it's it's going to look phenomenal. I also

152
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:31,360
love the fact that the fortress is able to hide
itself because, you know, considering we have

153
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,000
Google Maps and satellite technology, it would
not be difficult for people in governments to spot

154
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,520
superman fortress. So the fact that it's able to
grow out of the ground, I thought was fascinating.

155
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:47,960
The robots were a surprise, kind of. It was a
surprise that there were so many of them. And one of

156
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:53,440
them was voiced by friggin Alan Tudyk, who is
apparently doing like all the voice roles in the DC

157
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,480
universe. He also does Dr. Phosphorus. He did
Clayface. It's like, holy cow, how many more are

158
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,540
you going to do? The design of the robots struck me
as particularly odd because they were kind of

159
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:09,520
retro futuristic, which concerns me because we
know that the entire style of the Fantastic Four

160
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,500
movie that's coming out just two weeks after
Superman is also retro futuristic. So I'm

161
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:20,340
concerned that the two films are going to have a
very similar aesthetic that I think audiences

162
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:25,560
aren't going to appreciate them being so similar.
I did not even think about that, but that is

163
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:31,400
completely valid. I'm just glad that Superman
comes out first. I mean, the design of Kirby is

164
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,480
different from these Kryptonian robots, but I
would say that they have the same style. Yeah, and

165
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,980
actually, now that you mentioned it, the
cinematography of both films is not too far off

166
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:44,100
either. Right. Right. Like the color palette is
kind of similar. The one thing that threw me off the

167
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:49,780
most in this trailer, even more than Krypto's
behavior, was the sunlight magnification tool

168
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:55,720
that the robots used to heal Superman from his
injuries. I've never seen Superman react that way

169
00:15:55,720 --> 00:16:03,080
to sunlight. It almost seemed like he was in pain. I
was like, stop it, you're killing him. It was just

170
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,800
bizarre. And some people on a discard were saying
that maybe it was like a pleasure reaction, just

171
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:17,160
like pleasure overload, which I'm like, yeah. I
said that, actually. But no, I think he's having a

172
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:22,860
reaction to the intense accelerated healing
process. You know, it's painful, even though he's

173
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:27,460
being healed. What did you think of the robots
humor, by the way? There wasn't much humor there.

174
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:31,680
Like one of them was like, don't thank us. We want to
appreciate it. And then the girl robot was like, he

175
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:37,580
looked at me. He isn't that contradictory. Like,
do they have emotions or don't they? That's a great

176
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:42,940
question. I have no idea. Are you concerned about
the writing and the tone of this movie based off of

177
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:49,140
this extent of sneak peek? The tone is jarring. I'm
not going to lie. This is a very different tone from

178
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,740
what we've been used to with the character of
Superman. That said, I'm not really concerned

179
00:16:53,740 --> 00:17:00,160
about the writing because I know James Gunn is a
good writer. He's a really good writer, actually.

180
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,380
I'm just not sure how to take some of these comedic
beats out of context. Well, I guess we'll see how

181
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:09,960
the film turns out when it comes out in just a few
months. That's right. The film is coming out July

182
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:16,839
11th. Hopefully we get a new trailer before then
and just this extended one of the previous trailer

183
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:21,319
that we got. Yeah, I think we're going to get a new
trailer soon. And I think it needs to be fucking

184
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:26,520
incredible because I think a lot of people are on
the fence about this movie and they just need to be

185
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:31,040
wowed. They need to be convinced. So James Gunn
better pull out all the stops on this next trailer.

186
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,520
100 percent. I want to know who the villain is. I
want to know what the stakes are. Visually, it just

187
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,420
needs to be breathtaking, which I'm not too
worried about. But yeah, it's it's got to be good.

188
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:46,080
Maybe less crypto. I don't know. It depends on how
lovable you can make him. But speaking of crypto,

189
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:55,220
that brings us to our question of the week. What do
you think of crypto, the super dog from the

190
00:17:55,220 --> 00:18:00,740
Superman sneak peek? Yeah, did you love him? Did
you hate him? Did you think he was funny? Did you

191
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:06,760
relate to that dog in some way from personal
experience with your own pets? Let us know. Record

coming out of CinemaCon, we got the title for the

197
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:38,500
upcoming Spider-Man 4 film, which was revealed to
be Spider-Man Brand New Day. Now, the previous

198
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:44,320
trilogy of Spider-Man films all included home in
the title for some reason. None of those movies

199
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:50,480
were named after a comic book arc or anything like
that. You know, you had homecoming, you had far

200
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,140
from home and you had no way home. I'm really glad to
move on from those. I think if you've listened to

201
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,500
this podcast for a while, you'll know that
Jonathan and I didn't love any of the home titles.

202
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:06,620
I'm really glad to see them now referencing the
comic books with their subtitle, Brand New Day. Of

203
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:13,540
course, those who read the comics will recognize
this as a dance slot run back in the early 2010s that

204
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:20,660
came after the one more day story arc, where
basically Peter Parker's marriage and life was

205
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:27,680
erased from reality. And he was rebooted in that he
was no longer married to Mary Jane and he was living

206
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,100
with Aunt May again, kind of down on his luck. The
one more day arc really brought the character back

207
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,520
to basics and introduced some pretty cool
characters like Mr. Negative and Anti-Venom and

208
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,420
paved the way for future great stories like the
superior Spider-Man. Will any of that be

209
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:47,780
addressed within this film? I don't know, but I
like the idea of Spider-Man kind of starting fresh

210
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:53,300
with this new Spider-Man 4 film, especially
considering how the No Way Home film ended. Now,

211
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:57,360
Brand New Day has nothing to do with the
multiverse, correct? Correct, because rumors

212
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,900
are that Brand New Day, you know, taking place
between Doomsday and Seeker Wars is going to

213
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:06,720
heavily involve the multiverse. So I'm wondering
how they're going to adapt that storyline, if they

214
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:12,140
are at all, for a multiverse soul entry? That's a
good question. I don't think they're actually

215
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:18,060
going to adapt anything from the comic books
regarding the Brand New Day arc. What I really want

216
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:23,780
to see, and I think what a lot of fans want to see, are
either a Spider-Man vs. Venom storyline with

217
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:28,840
Eddie Brock or like a Spider-Verse movie where
they introduce Miles Morales and Spider Gwyn.

218
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:33,880
Marvel has, you know, borrowed arc titles from the
books and not adapted them one for one. Look at

219
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:40,920
things like Thor Ragnarok or even Civil War, which
had the same premise as the arc in the books, but the

220
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:46,220
execution was entirely different. That's fair,
like Secret Invasion even? Exactly. Yeah, that

221
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:52,000
was too different if you ask me. But I think, you
know, this title gives Spider-Man fans a lot to

222
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,040
look forward to. I think at least a lot to hope for.
And, you know, the Spider-Man franchise has

223
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,840
always been good ever since the production of them
was taken over by Marvel Studios. So, yeah, lots to

224
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,780
look forward to, especially considering, again,
that it's being directed by Dustin Daniel Cretan,

225
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:11,060
of course, who helmed the Shang-Chi and the legend
of the Ten Rings film. Yeah, I'm still sad that he's

226
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:15,960
not moving forward with the Shang-Chi sequel, but
he's definitely deserving of directing a

227
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:27,140
Spider-Man film. But that does it for all the news
for this episode. So let's go ahead and move into

228
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:33,800
our main event, where we find out who would win in a
fight between DC's Ratcatcher and Marvel's

229
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:54,460
Squirrel Girl. All right, Ratcatcher versus
Squirrel Girl. These are two fairly well-known

230
00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:00,980
characters, I think. They both have rodent-based
powers in that they can each control the animals of

231
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:06,120
their namesake. Ratcatcher controls rats,
Squirrel Girl controls squirrels. There's

232
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:12,400
really not too much more to it than that. Now, we
have actually had the idea for this tool for quite

233
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,600
some time. And I'm actually pretty excited to
finally be getting around to it, because I am aware

234
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,460
of Squirrel Girl's legend, and I will be glad to
knock her down a peg, because I'm just going to say,

235
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:30,560
I think she's overhyped because she beat people
like Dr. Doom. Exactly. What? There's no way she's

236
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:35,660
that powerful. Apparently she is. For people who
may be unaware of the character, Squirrel Girl is

237
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:42,200
notorious for being one of the more ridiculously
themed heroes who just so happened to defeat Dr.

238
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:50,020
Doom in canon in the comic books by basically
overwhelming him with a vast legion of squirrels.

239
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:55,200
It's pretty ridiculous to say the least, but the
character does have her charms. She's kind of a gag

240
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,180
character, though, in just the people that she's
been able to beat in the comic books, which also

241
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:05,400
includes Thanos and Galactus. It's pretty funny.
If you go onto the official Marvel power grid on the

242
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:11,200
marvel.com website and look at her stats, she's
actually maxed out at sevens across the board. So I

243
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,340
think you have a hard time ahead of you, Jonathan.
There's no way she's going to be maxed out on all of

244
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:21,860
her stats. That's dumb. Now, Squirrel Girl has not
appeared in a film like Ratcatcher has, although

245
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:27,420
in the Suicide Squad film, there's actually
Ratcatcher's daughter who kind of took up his

246
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:33,960
mantle. But Squirrel Girl was almost in a
television series played by Milana Vayntrob. And

247
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,180
I'm actually kind of sad that that show never came
out, because I thought she would have been great

248
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:42,220
for that role. Oh, she's a perfect Squirrel Girl,
but she did get to voice the character of Squirrel

249
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:47,080
Girl in several of the Marvel Rising cartoon
movies. Oh, I didn't know that. I'm glad Kevin

250
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:52,000
Faggy threw her a bone after the show was canceled.
Oh, for sure. And of course, Ratcatcher was played

251
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,680
by Daniela Melchior in the Suicide Squad film,
who, as you said, was the daughter of the original

252
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,860
Ratcatcher, who was played by Tycho Waititi.
Can't wait to find out who will win. But to explain

253
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:08,340
the methodology behind our duels, let's go to our
sentient dual simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000.

254
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:13,300
AJ9K tell our listeners how you go about
determining a winner in our dual matchups. Yes, of

255
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:18,260
course, sir. The way I determine a winner between
the contestants is by running 1000 Monte Carlo

256
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:23,660
simulations using the characters statistics. A
Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic model

257
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:28,400
used to determine outcomes through random
sampling. In this case, I randomize the

258
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,340
statistics along a normal distribution as a way to
simulate the many variables that can occur during

259
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:38,280
battle. The stat parameters are based on the
official Marvel power grid from which the DC

260
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,940
characters statistics are extrapolated.
Additional stat categories are included such as

261
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:48,460
range, damage potential, versatility and
perception in order to create a more detailed and

262
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:53,820
accurate simulation. The results of the 1000
simulations provide a percentage of wins for each

263
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:58,400
character. The contestant with the higher
percentage is declared the victor as they have a

264
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,700
higher probability to win any given battle. In an
equitable pairing, neither character should win

265
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:09,020
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat

266
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:13,500
Superman. So the confidence rate of my method
falls in line with the precedents that have been

267
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,340
established in the source material. My
mathematical simulations are without

268
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:22,920
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for

269
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:28,500
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K!
Before we run the simulations though, we'd like to

270
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,100
break down each character's histories and
abilities before improvising a scenario on how we

271
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:38,920
imagine one of the 1000 simulations would play out
beat for beat. And I believe it's my turn to go first

272
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:44,600
with the DC characters backstory, so let me tell
you all about Ratcatcher. Born and raised in

273
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:49,960
Gotham City, Otis Flanagan worked as a municipal
exterminator for the Gotham City Sanitation

274
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:55,460
Department. As a Ratcatcher, he developed an
uncanny connection with Verman, frequently

275
00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:01,040
claiming he could train them to respond to his
commands. Those who worked with him dismissed the

276
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:06,360
claim as delusional, pointing to his solitary
demeanor and increasingly erratic behavior.

277
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:12,280
Viewed as eccentric and untrustworthy, Otis's
reputation deteriorated further after he was

278
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:17,520
arrested for stabbing and killing a man during a
street fight. Convicted of manslaughter, he was

279
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,780
sentenced to 10 years in Black Gate Penitentiary.
During his incarceration, Otis became

280
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:27,840
increasingly bitter and reclusive. Feeling
betrayed by the very city he had spent his life

281
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:34,560
serving, he reevaluated his role in Gotham's
ecosystem. In his eyes, the true infestation was

282
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,580
not the rats he once exterminated, but the
citizens and officials who had turned against

283
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:44,480
him. Embracing the company of rodents, he began
forming a bond with the prison's vermin

284
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,520
population, feeding them, studying them,
training them, and eventually commanding them.

285
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:56,480
His affinity for rats grew into an obsession,
where others saw filth, Otis saw loyalty. He came

286
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,880
to believe the rats, like himself, were
misunderstood and mistreated. When he was

287
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:07,060
released for good behavior, Otis adopted a new
identity, Ratcatcher. Returning to Gotham, Otis

288
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:12,270
sought revenge on the four officials who had
played key roles in his conviction. One by one, he

289
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:17,820
abducted them, luring or ambushing each one into
the city's underground sewer system, which he now

290
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,660
called home. With his deep knowledge of the
subterranean tunnels, he eluded law enforcement

291
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:28,820
and concealed his victims in a hidden underground
lair. There, aided by an ever-growing swarm of

292
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:34,080
rats, he subjected the officials to years of
psychological and physical torment. Bowed in

293
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,860
darkness, the prisoners endured the constant
gnawing presence of vermin, while Otis preached

294
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:43,960
to them about his vision of a future where rats
inherited the earth. His captives remained

295
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:50,420
hidden for five years, presumed dead, while Otis
refined his control over rats using whistles,

296
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:55,620
high-frequency tones, and other methods of
animal training. Eventually, one of Otis'

297
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:01,300
prisoners, Judge Wyatt Hogan, managed to
successfully escape captivity and nearly made it

298
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:07,620
to the surface until he was killed by a swarm of
rats. His body was found by Batman, however, who

299
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:12,200
followed the trail of vermin back through the
sewers. The Dark Knight confronted Ratcatcher in

300
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:17,180
his lair, quickly dispersing the rats with
ultrasonic emitters before defeating Otis and

301
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:21,700
delivering him to the authorities. While
incarcerated once more, Otis used his abilities

302
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:27,380
to build a reputation inside of Blackgate. With
rats acting as messengers and couriers, he

303
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:32,060
developed a barter system among inmates,
smuggling contraband through ventilation ducts

304
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:37,520
and sewer lines. His network proved invaluable to
other criminals, including Bane, who used

305
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,740
Ratcatcher's rodent couriers to help him
orchestrate an escape. Despite being locked

306
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:47,540
away, Otis' influence spread across the prison.
The vermin he trained became his eyes and ears

307
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:51,380
throughout Blackgate, allowing him to
communicate with allies and track prison

308
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:57,260
movement unnoticed. He later escaped during a
parole hearing, using a flute he had secretly

309
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:02,800
carved to emit high-pitched frequencies that
summoned rats. Overrunning the courtroom with

310
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:07,800
rodents, he fled back to the depths of Gotham's
sewers, where he attempted to orchestrate a

311
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,760
scheme to take over the city with rats, but his plan
was stopped by Nightwing, who at the time was

312
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:17,800
temporarily operating as Batman, and Otis was
sent to prison once again. You can learn more about

313
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:23,080
Nightwing in his duel against Daredevil. When a
devastating earthquake struck Gotham, turning

314
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:28,740
it into a no-man's land, Ratcatcher was among the
many inmates who escaped the ruined prison. He

315
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:33,580
resurfaced briefly, joining a group of villains
attempting to exploit the city's chaos, but was

316
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:39,020
recaptured shortly afterward. Though his role in
the criminal underworld was often secondary, his

317
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,680
knowledge of the city's subterranean network
made him a recurring nuisance for authorities and

318
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:49,300
an asset to fellow rogues. In the wake of Gotham's
reconstruction, Otis took refuge among the

319
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:55,020
city's homeless population. Sympathetic to his
cause, some of Gotham's vagrants saw Ratcatcher

320
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:01,180
as a kind of folk figure, an enemy of the elite who
lived among societies forgotten. He was

321
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:05,100
eventually discovered by authorities and
confronted by police. One of the homeless

322
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:10,520
individuals who attempted to protect him was
secretly an Omak sleeper agent. When the man was

323
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:16,220
struck by police, the Omak programming activated
and identified Ratcatcher as a gamma-level

324
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:21,320
threat. Before Otis could escape, he was
vaporized on the spot. In post-Flashpoint

325
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:26,820
continuity, Otis was presumed dead until he was
once again seen navigating the city's sewers and

326
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:31,540
subterranean ruins, where he resumed his
criminal activities and was discovered working

327
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:38,160
alongside Menace, a known adversary of Batwing.
You can learn more about in our Batwing vs. Miles

328
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:43,020
Morales episode. Otis' skills brought him into
contact with a wide range of Gotham's criminal

329
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:48,440
underworld. At one point, he aligned himself with
the Gotham vigilante mother panic, operating not

330
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:54,440
as an enemy, but as a reluctant ally. Eventually
returning to crime, however, Otis clashed with

331
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:00,640
Batman again after being tracked to a sewer base,
fortified by tunnels, booby traps, and swarms of

332
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:05,560
defensive vermin, though Batman was able to
overcome all of Otis' obstacles and capture him

333
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:11,280
once again. Powers-wise, Ratcatcher has no
superhuman abilities outside of his talent to

334
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:17,860
train and control rats, seemingly via a staff and
lantern that he carries. He uses the rats to attack

335
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:24,500
enemies and swarms, send messages, and smuggle
contraband. Ratcatcher also uses a gas gun and gas

336
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:29,520
grenades capable of emitting cyanide or other
noxious chemicals, which he's protected from

337
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:35,600
thanks to his gas mask. And that's Ratcatcher.
Okay, so he does employ some gadgets in addition to

338
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:42,100
the rats that he controls. Yes. Well, he's gonna
need them because Squirrel Girl is about to eat

339
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:48,960
some nuts and kick some butts. Let me tell you about
her backstory. Doreen Green was born in Canada to

340
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,360
Dorian and Maureen Green. A genetic modification
of unknown origin granted her squirrel-like

341
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,320
traits, which began to manifest when she was 10
years old. These included a large,

342
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:04,280
semi-prehensile tail and the ability to
communicate with squirrels. After rescuing a

343
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:10,160
squirrel from a dog, she befriended it and named it
Monkey Joe. The two became partners and Monkey Joe

344
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:15,040
encouraged Doreen to use her powers to help
people. Although Doreen initially believed she

345
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:21,500
was a mutant, a doctor confirmed otherwise. At age
14, Doreen adopted the alias Squirrel Girl, an

346
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:26,660
ambushed Iron Man in a forest near Stark
Enterprises, hoping to prove herself as a worthy

347
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:32,140
sidekick. Iron Man declined, but when Dr. Doom
appeared and captured him, Doreen summoned a

348
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:37,820
horde of squirrels, including Monkey Joe, to
overwhelm Doom's ship and free Iron Man. The

349
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:43,820
squirrels disabled Doom's systems and forced him
to flee, marking Doreen's first major victory.

350
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:48,700
Following this, she continued to train and hone
her skills. Around her 15th birthday, she aided

351
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,380
the Hulk in a fight against the Abomination,
directing the blinded Hulk while her squirrels

352
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:58,660
helped subdue the enemy. Later, Doreen relocated
to New York City and began fighting crime in

353
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:04,520
Central Park, where she saved the Great Lakes
Avengers, Flatman and Dorman from Muggers.

354
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,840
Impressed, they invited her and Monkey Joe to join
the team. As a member of the Great Lakes Avengers,

355
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,800
Doreen battled threats like Batrox Brigade and
witnessed the death of the team's newest member,

356
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:20,460
Grasshopper. Tragedy struck again when Monkey
Joe was killed by a leather boy, a rejected member

357
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:26,560
of the team disguised as Dr. Doom. After mourning
her squirrels loss, Doreen helped the team defeat

358
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:33,060
Maelstrom with an army of squirrels, of which only
one survived. She named the survivor Tippi Toe,

359
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:38,360
who became her new companion and remained at her
side, moving forward. During this period, Doreen

360
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:44,880
and Tippi Toe independently defeated Modak,
Tarix, and even Thanos, off panel, but his defeat

361
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:50,840
was verified by Uwatu the Watcher. Despite being
offered a position by Shield, Doreen declined,

362
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:55,840
preferring to stay with the Great Lakes Avengers.
She later joined the Thing in a battle against

363
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,740
Bibeast in Central Park, after which she and the
team attended a superhero poker tournament.

364
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:06,120
There, Flatman won with a straight flush, and the
group adopted the name Great Lakes Champions.

365
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,580
When the Superhuman Registration Act went into
effect, the team registered and joined the

366
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:15,380
initiative as Wisconsin's official superhero
team. During this period, Deadpool mistakenly

367
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:20,060
attacked them under the belief they were
unregistered, and Doreen defeated Deadpool with

368
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:26,060
ease. Squirrel Girl later helped rescue the god
Dionysus from Advanced Idea Mechanics, or AIM for

369
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:31,120
short, returning him to Olympus after their
victory. Around this time, she revealed her

370
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:36,219
admiration for the new warriors, especially
Speedball, who you can learn more about in his duel

371
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:41,440
against Wally West the Flash. After Speedball's
transformation into the guilt-ridden Vigilante

372
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:47,260
Penance, Doreen attempted to change his fate by
using a time machine borrowed from Dr. Doom.

373
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:52,500
Instead, she traveled to the year 2099, where she
met alternate versions of Speedball and Mr.

374
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:57,240
Immortal, though she was convinced by him to
return to her own time. During the Alien Squirrel

375
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:02,540
secret invasion of Earth, the team discovered a
scroll posing as their newest recruit. After the

376
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:07,920
initiative reorganized under Norman Osborn,
Doreen left the group after defeating Fin Feng Fum

377
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,620
on her own and returned to New York. You can learn
more about Fin Feng Fum in his duel against Star-O

378
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:18,820
the Conqueror. In New York, Doreen became the
nanny for Danielle Cage, who was the daughter of

379
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:23,780
Luke Cage and Jessica Jones. She cared for the
child through several crises, including the

380
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:29,240
attacks from the Thule Society, the Revengers,
and the Organization Hammer. She remained with

381
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:34,300
the family even after they departed the Avengers,
continuing to protect Danielle. You can learn

382
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:39,640
more about Luke Cage and Jessica Jones in their
respective duels against Thunder and Huntress.

383
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:44,440
After leaving the cages, Doreen enrolled at
Empire State University to study computer

384
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,860
science. On her first day, she met Nancy
Whitehead, who would become her best friend. She

385
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:54,560
also confronted Craven the Hunter and persuaded
him to redirect his energy toward hunting sea

386
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:00,460
monsters instead of squirrels. Not long after,
Doreen intercepted Galactus on route to Earth,

387
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:05,060
wearing Iron Man's armor she traveled to the moon
and persuaded the cosmic being to feed on a

388
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:10,060
different planet rich in nuts. This encounter
ended peacefully and Galactus left Earth

389
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:15,160
unharmed. You can learn more about Galactus in his
duel against the Spectre and more about Craven in

390
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:20,560
his duel against Vixen. Upon Doreen's return,
Nancy revealed that she had figured out Squirrel

391
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,560
Girl's secret identity but promised to keep it a
secret, and the two formed a close friendship.

392
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:31,700
Doreen also met Chipmunk Hunk and Koi Boy, fellow
students with animal-based powers. Together

393
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,640
with Tipito, the group battled threats like
Mysterion and the Asgardian Squirrel God,

394
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:42,060
Ratatosker, with aid from Loki and Thor. Doreen
and Nancy also rehabilitated the villain

395
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:47,940
Braindrain, updating his outdated systems and
encouraging him to pursue education at Empire

396
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:53,340
State University. Although romance wasn't a
major focus for Squirrel Girl, Doreen's interest

397
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:58,440
in Chipmunk Hunk was complicated when he began
dating someone else. Encouraged by her friends to

398
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:04,060
try online dating, she endured a series of
unsuccessful experiences. Mole Man, angered by

399
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:08,860
her earlier interference in his domain, began
demanding her attention. After a confrontation

400
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:13,920
including Tricephalus, who was in love with Mole
Man, Doreen allowed herself to be defeated to end

401
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,020
his pursuit, and she stepped away from dating. A
separate version of Doreen created through a

402
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:24,940
cloning device became her antagonist. The clone,
Aline, lacked Doreen's empathy and sought to

403
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:29,760
build a squirrel dominated utopia. She
imprisoned heroes in the negative zone, a hostile

404
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:35,460
alternate dimension, and banished Doreen to the
moon. There, Doreen summoned Mjolnir and became

405
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:40,900
Squirrel Thor. After liberating the heroes,
Doreen made one last appeal to Aline's humanity.

406
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:46,340
Aline willingly stayed behind and reshaped the
negative zone into Squirrel Topia 5000, the

407
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:52,020
society that she had envisioned. Doreen and her
friends later visited there with mutual respect.

408
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:57,820
During Doreen's second year at ESU, she joined the
US Avengers. She also encountered Melissa

409
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:03,400
Morbeck, a villain who posed as a benefactor for
the Avengers and gifted Squirrel Girl a flying

410
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:09,220
squirrel suit. Morbeck later used technology to
control animals and attacked the city, but Doreen

411
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:14,000
and her allies defeated her with the help of Nancy
and Mary, who disabled the controlled tech.

412
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,400
Later, Loki summoned Doreen to help repel a frost
giant invasion of North America. She reunited

413
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,680
with Ratatoskir, and together they sparked a
political revolution in Jotunheim that forced

414
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,960
the giants to retreat. Soon after, Morbeck
returned with an alliance of villains, including

415
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:36,200
Dr. Doom, Modok Superior, and Leader to exact
revenge. She leaked Doreen's identity to the

416
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:41,800
public and attacked her apartment using stolen
Iron Man armor. In the final confrontation,

417
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:47,100
several former foes turned to allies including
Kraven, Moleman, and the godlike entity Galactus

418
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:53,080
came to Doreen's defense. Galactus teleported
the villains away and restored Stark's armor,

419
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:58,140
while Iron Man publicly honored Doreen's
achievements. Following these events, Doreen

420
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:03,760
retired from superheroics and launched the
Inbeatable Squirrel Girl Radio Show, an A.M.

421
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,080
radio calling program where she answered
questions about being a hero. Her co-hosts

422
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:15,240
included Tippi Toe, Nancy, Koi Boy, Chipmunk
Hunk, and Braindrain. And that's her backstory.

423
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:20,300
Powers-wise, Squirrel Girl has the enhanced
proportionate physicality of a squirrel. This

424
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:24,800
grants her increased strength, able to lift
around 10 tons, increased durability, and

425
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,060
increased reflexes and leaping distance. She has
a 3-foot-long, bushy tail and small claws on her

426
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:35,760
hands and feet that help her climb. Her front and
sides teeth are abnormally large, like a rodents,

427
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,280
giving her superior biting strength. In
addition, Squirrel Girl has a small knuckle spike

428
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:45,740
she can retract from the back of each hand that is
sharp enough to carve into wood. She is fluent in

429
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:50,600
Squirrel Chatter, which she can use to speak with
and command vast legions of squirrels, either to

430
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:56,300
assist her in battle, serve as a distraction, or
chew through electronic components. However,

431
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:01,040
Squirrel Girl's most valuable skill is the
ability to reason, negotiate, and draw empathy

432
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,180
from others through verbal communication, which
has allowed her to most commonly defeat villains

433
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:10,960
through reasoning rather than physical
confrontation. She also has a utility belt with

434
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,380
pouches that she calls her nut sacks, which she
uses to carry a variety of nuts as snacks for

435
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:24,320
herself and her squirrel friends. Wow! And that's
Squirrel Girl. She is the most frustrating

436
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:32,320
character for me as a hater of all things Marvel,
because you know she's a joke and it's ridiculous

437
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:39,620
the feats she's been able to accomplish, like
defeating Thanos and Galactus as well. What? Is

438
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:46,400
Squirrel Girl a joke or is it your face? We're
twins. Yeah, but like you know we don't look that

439
00:40:46,400 --> 00:41:16,320
similar. We're identical twins! We're video game
legends brawl every Monday. Dynamic duel where

440
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:22,100
comic book tyens smash every Tuesday. Max
destruction where TV and action heroes battle

441
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:28,900
every Wednesday. And Sendro World where anime
champions clash every Thursday. Join us as we

442
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:34,100
speculate on the matches and armed with the power
of mathematical simulations to discover who will

443
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:44,100
emerge victorious. Visit dynamicpodcast.com
where we settle the debate and settle the score.

444
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,360
Now that we've got their histories and abilities
out of the way let's speculate on how one of the 1000

445
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:53,660
simulated matches will go. The winner is
determined by simulations, not the speculation,

446
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:59,320
but it's fun to imagine how the fight could play
out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?

447
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:04,020
Well I should say there are no rules other than the
characters have no prior knowledge of the other

448
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:08,780
going into the fight. All they are aware of
starting out is that the other character is a

449
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:13,140
threat that needs to be eliminated. For the
speculation the contestants will begin

450
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:18,540
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript
environment that will have no bearing on the match

451
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:23,440
itself as no environmental statistics are
considered in my simulations. The contestants

452
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:29,140
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright then
let's get into it. Ratcatcher and Squirrel Girl

453
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:35,440
meet on the battlefield who goes first. I'm going
to say that since there are way more rats on the

454
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,940
planet than there are squirrels, that Ratcatcher
is going to go first because just of you know how

455
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:48,400
more accessible rats would be to summon for him and
so he's going to start by sending a swarm or rather a

456
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:55,640
mischief of rats to attack Squirrel Girl. A group
of rats is called a mischief? Yep. Okay I learned

457
00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:00,880
something today. I don't know what a group of
squirrels is called. One sec. Okay they're called

458
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:10,300
a scurry. So Squirrel Girl sees Ratcatcher summon
this rat army and she's like okay you want to get

459
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:18,980
nuts? Come on let's get nuts. Squirrel Stampede
and she summons this scurry of squirrels to match

460
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:25,200
the size of Ratcatcher's rat army. Okay these rats
are way meaner than squirrels though. We're

461
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:32,400
talking like roided out New York City subway pizza
rats here. They will fuck these squirrels up and

462
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,100
that's what they're gonna do. You know just
zooming in on this mini battle we're gonna see

463
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:43,480
squirrels getting slashed open, limbs not off,
eyeballs tail whipped right out of their sockets.

464
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:49,080
It's gonna be a scene like right out of Watership
Down just squirrel carnage everywhere. Oh man

465
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:56,680
okay first of all you're sick bastard. Second of
all like rats are mean and big or whatever but

466
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:02,840
squirrels are way more agile than these fat ass
rats. So like maybe a few squirrels go down but a

467
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:08,160
majority of them are just gonna leap over the rats
including Squirrel Girl. She and the squirrels

468
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:14,660
are gonna like long jump over the rat army over to
where Ratcatcher is and she's gonna break the

469
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:20,680
staff and the lantern that he uses to control the
rats with some well executed knuckle spike

470
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:27,260
punches. She punches the staff? Yeah with her
knuckle spike it breaks it and the lantern. Okay I

471
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:32,500
mean he doesn't actually need those things to
direct rats. I think he just uses the lantern to see

472
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:39,080
in the sewers. He could verbally command them but
now that Squirrel Girl is in close Ratcatcher is

473
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:44,840
just gonna point blank blaster right in the face
with the cyanide capsule from his gas gun and she's

474
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:50,260
gonna breathe that in and die. No no she doesn't
breathe in the cyanide gas because she

475
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:57,080
immediately covers her face with her long pushy
tail and it functions as like a gas mask of sorts. At

476
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:02,440
least long enough for some squirrels to bite
through the firing mechanism on Ratcatcher's gas

477
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:08,160
gun and just render it completely useless and
actually they also chew off his trigger finger

478
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:15,180
too. Geez and then Squirrel Girl is gonna use her
tail to fan the gas away from her. Okay well I'm

479
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:22,400
gonna say surprise there were actually rats
hiding in Squirrel Girl's tail so when she uses it

480
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,360
to cover her face she already has like a rat chewing
on her nose and as she's using her tail to fan the gas

481
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:34,300
away she's also just flinging more rats onto
herself and they all begin to chew through her I

482
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:40,540
guess. Okay well Squirrel Girl stops these rats
from chewing through her by summoning a suit of

483
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:45,580
squirrel armor. You know she has all her furry
friends come over and cover and protect her body

484
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:51,860
and these squirrels are gonna repel the rats that
are crawling on her and then Squirrel Girl points

485
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:57,860
her arm at Ratcatcher and kind of like one of Iron
Man's repulsor blasts she's gonna fire a squirrel

486
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:03,280
pulsor blast from her squirrel armor which is just
really just sending a bunch of squirrels right at

487
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,620
Ratcatcher right at his nuts and these squirrels
straight up castrate him. She's like get those

488
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:14,800
nuts! Geez! Okay well to get the squirrels away
from him right away Ratcatcher he's gonna slam

489
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:20,620
down a gas grenade right at his feet and the
squirrels they're just gonna fall off of him and

490
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:26,240
that's when he's gonna unleash this barrage of rat
traps that are gonna land on Squirrel Girl's armor

491
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:32,020
snapping and killing enough squirrels to expose
an opening in her armor that his rats can penetrate

492
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:37,160
and dismantle that armor. You know it's not real
armor right it's just a bunch of squirrels on her

493
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:42,480
body that she calls her squirrel armor. I
understand the joke. Okay okay okay Squirrel Girl

494
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:47,260
loses her squirrel armor then but then she's gonna
tell some squirrels to hold their breath you know

495
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:52,920
and their little squirrel cheeks in order to avoid
Ratcatcher's poison cloud and they're gonna leap

496
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:58,100
over onto Ratcatcher's face and chew through his
gas mask which falls off and therefore he ends up

497
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:06,280
poisoning himself and dying. No because he has a
swarm of rats sacrifice themselves to cover and

498
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:11,740
protect him from the poison and then just shuffle
him away like carrying him through this massive

499
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:18,960
wave of rats that surround Squirrel Girl and
before she realizes it Ratcatcher is gonna reach

500
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:25,380
out from the wave and grab her by the ankles and just
pull her right into the rat avalanche and by the

501
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:31,700
time it dissipates all that's gonna be left of
Squirrel Girl is a bucktooth skeleton. Match over

502
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:38,420
it. Actually this whole time Squirrel Girl had her
squirrels talking with the rats and convincing

503
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:43,840
them that listening to this Ratcatcher guy isn't
all that it's cracked up to be like he's a huge

504
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:50,970
asshole and the squirrels convinced the rats to
ignore his commands and attack him instead. So

505
00:47:50,970 --> 00:47:56,640
this rat avalanche that you're talking about that
you say devour Squirrel Girl actually they just

506
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:02,400
devour Ratcatcher instead and like as
Ratcatcher's like what the hell and he like cries

507
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:08,620
out in agony Squirrel Girl is gonna seal the deal by
expertly chucking over a couple of acorns into his

508
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:16,040
mouth and he dies choking on her nuts. Match over.
Of course. I say that these squirrels don't

509
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:20,600
convince the rats of anything because the
squirrels have rabies and they just give the

510
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:25,340
squirrels rabies so actually the squirrels turn
on Squirrel Girl. Well let's go ahead and leave the

511
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:32,500
match there. Either the squirrels convince the
rats to turn on Ratcatcher or the rats give the

512
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:37,960
squirrels rabies causing Squirrel Girl to get
devoured by an avalanche of rodents. That's

513
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:42,540
right. Let's go ahead and put the character stats,
run the simulations and find out which scenario

514
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:49,960
happens when we come back with a winner. AG9K hit
it. Inputting data, running calculations,

515
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:57,360
processing results, simulations complete. Okay
I did not know going into this match that Squirrel

516
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:04,720
Girl has the proportionate speed and strength and
overall physicality of a squirrel. Well I didn't

517
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:10,760
know going into this match that Ratcatcher had a
gas pellet gun and gas grenades. Though that

518
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:16,840
didn't really quite help him in the stats. I mean it
gave him the leg up in versatility but not much

519
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:22,900
else. The only other stat that Ratcatcher came
ahead in was intelligence though they did tie in a

520
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:28,960
few stat categories. We definitely did not max out
Squirrel Girl stats as suggested by the Marvel

521
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:35,160
Power Grid. No I mean like a joke character
bullshit aside we the podcast don't consider

522
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:40,680
Squirrel Girl imbedable. We tried to approach her
statistics as fairly as possible. That being said

523
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:46,180
she's quite impressive statistically. She's
fast, she's evasive, she's durable, she's

524
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:51,880
strong, she's pretty smart and she actually has
fighting experience unlike Ratcatcher. No he is

525
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:58,600
not a good fighter at all. So taking the stats into
account Joseph who would you say came out on top in

526
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:03,960
this match? Obviously Squirrel Girl she is the
unbeatable Squirrel Girl that's just how it is

527
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:09,440
that's that's reality and I don't know anybody who
would disagree with that. Instagram certainly

528
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:16,860
agrees with me because 73% of our followers cited
with Squirrel Girl in this match. I really really

529
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:22,880
don't want Squirrel Girl to win but I'm scared not
gonna lie. Let's see who came out on top AJ9K the

530
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:32,300
results please. Hey you are sir. The winner of the
matchup between Ratcatcher and Squirrel Girl is

531
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:45,820
Squirrel Girl. Buy a lot. She won 784 of the 1000
matches or 78.4% of the time. Are you sure that's

532
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:55,720
not 99.9% of the time? It is not but might as well be.
Ratcatcher only won 21.6% of his matches less than

533
00:50:55,720 --> 00:51:00,600
a quarter. It's kind of embarrassing. Is this one
of the biggest wind spreads that we've ever had on

534
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:06,060
the podcast? It is. Does that mean this is a
mismatch or does it just mean that Squirrel Girl is

535
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:13,160
that fucking awesome? I will admit to nothing. I
don't think this was a mismatch but I will also not

536
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:18,780
admit that Squirrel Girl is awesome because I have
my pride. Well I think it stands to reason that if

537
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:24,100
Ratcatcher can single-handedly defeat Star of
the Conqueror as we saw in the Suicide Squad film

538
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:31,840
and Squirrel Girl beats Ratcatcher then Squirrel
Girl also probably beats Star of the Conqueror and

539
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:38,200
probably most of DC if we think about it. Again
there are way more rats in the world than there are

540
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:43,360
squirrels. It's not about quantity it's about
quality and everybody knows the squirrels are

541
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:48,160
better than rats. No one fucking likes rats
everybody loves squirrels. This match played out

542
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:55,800
exactly how it was supposed to so DC can see these
nuts. Can we just end this episode already? Gosh!

543
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:03,320
That does it for this duel AJ9K. Close us out.
