Dynamic Duel. On with the show!

10
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:22,078
Welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

11
00:01:22,098 --> 00:01:27,523
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

12
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:33,729
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother Marvelous
Joe. In this episode, we will be reviewing

13
00:01:33,809 --> 00:01:40,455
the long-delayed Morbius film produced by Sony
Pictures. Now, a lot of you may be surprised

14
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:44,858
in this upcoming review to hear that I actually
didn't hate it. Yeah, I went in with the lowest

15
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:49,099
of expectations and I was actually looking forward
to like hating on the film. But we'll get into

16
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:52,900
our thoughts later on in the episode. Before
that, we're going to break down the comic book

17
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,281
movie news from the past week. Of which there
is just one big movie related news item and

18
00:01:57,321 --> 00:02:03,603
that is that Sharon Stone is going to play the
villain Victoria Kord in the Blue Beetle movie.

19
00:02:03,643 --> 00:02:07,924
It was a pretty slow news week. It seemed like
all of the Hollywood news was about Will Smith

20
00:02:08,064 --> 00:02:14,134
and like Ezra Miller. I mean the Ezra Miller
news does sort of affect the DCEU. but it wasn't

21
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:19,338
specific to the flash, so we're not really gonna
talk about it. As always, we list our segment

22
00:02:19,378 --> 00:02:23,120
times in our episode description, so feel free

27
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:49,716
Our lowest tier is only $2 a month. But with
that out of the way, quick to the no prize.

28
00:02:51,718 --> 00:02:56,462
A no prize is an award Marvel used to give out
up until the 90s to fans. Our version, the

29
00:02:56,502 --> 00:03:01,887
dynamic dual no prize, is a digital award we
post on social media that Jonathan sometimes

30
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:07,011
draws for those who we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. That's fair. I

31
00:03:07,112 --> 00:03:12,839
am very, very behind. like a month behind on
these No Prize illustrations. Just I want to

32
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:18,220
apologize to everyone who's won a No Prize in
the past month. I'm working on them. I have

33
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,762
some of the illustrations done, not all of them.
I'm trying to put all of them up all at once.

34
00:03:23,222 --> 00:03:29,464
I think the listeners deserve to know why you're
so behind. So Joseph and I used to work together.

35
00:03:29,864 --> 00:03:37,539
He recently abandoned me, so I have more responsibilities
at work. And just life in general, I got a

36
00:03:37,579 --> 00:03:42,123
new house. I'm doing a lot of work on the house
on the weekends. It's I have less free time,

37
00:03:42,863 --> 00:03:47,187
but that's not a good excuse. And I need to
get on those drawings. I know. I know. I'm

38
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:55,313
sorry, guys. You're right. It's not a good excuse.
I said that. I said that. Anyway, last week,

39
00:03:55,513 --> 00:04:01,597
we asked the question, should the deleted scene
in The Batman with Joker have been in the movie?

40
00:04:02,022 --> 00:04:07,164
or not and why. And of course this was related
to the deleted scene that Matt Reeves posted

41
00:04:07,204 --> 00:04:12,726
to social media that we all got to see involving
the Joker and Batman in Arkham Asylum. We got

42
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:16,408
quite a few answers. Let's go through our list
of honorable mentions before we announce this

43
00:04:16,448 --> 00:04:22,850
no prize winner. Our first honorable mention
goes to John Spies who said, Hi gentlemen,

44
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:29,453
Executive Producer John Spies here. Not only
should the deleted scene not have appeared

45
00:04:29,493 --> 00:04:36,166
in the movie. But the whole Joker cameo was
completely unnecessary. It added nothing to

46
00:04:36,186 --> 00:04:41,991
the story, only to add for fan service, and
to be honest, we're a little oversaturated

47
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:47,615
with the Joker right now. So honestly, he's
got a whole rogues gallery. Give us something

48
00:04:47,675 --> 00:04:53,901
new. Do you think that the Joker was included
in the Batman movie as fan service? Oh yeah,

49
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:58,304
totally. I agree with John. I don't think there
was really any reason for him to be in the

50
00:04:58,324 --> 00:05:04,520
movie and even the deleted scene. save for fanservice.
It is great to know that he exists in that

51
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,983
universe and I definitely would have been questioning
where's the Joker if he didn't appear in the

52
00:05:09,003 --> 00:05:15,247
movie as a fan, but that being said I understand
it's there only for the fans and wasn't there

53
00:05:15,327 --> 00:05:19,950
for the story. I've gone back and forth as to
whether or not this should be in the film and

54
00:05:20,091 --> 00:05:25,750
you know acknowledging the fact that it is fanservice
is a pretty good reason. John of course is

55
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:30,372
the co-host of the Blast from Our Past podcast,
which he does with his brother Adam Spies.

56
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:35,774
Both John and Adam are actually going to be
guests on our podcast in just a couple of weeks.

57
00:05:36,014 --> 00:05:41,056
You may remember them from our past episodes
like our X-Men Origins Wolverine review and

58
00:05:41,136 --> 00:05:45,858
our review of the 1960s Batman movie with Adam
West. I love both of those episodes. I can't

59
00:05:45,938 --> 00:05:50,840
wait to have these guys back on our show. Yeah,
it'll be a great time. Our next honorable mention

60
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,942
goes to Rick, who said... Hey guys, Rick here.
I think it was super necessary to pull such

61
00:05:56,982 --> 00:06:01,224
an unnecessary scene from the movie. When I
say that, I don't mean I didn't like the character.

62
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:04,965
I loved his betrayal and take on the Joker.
I just don't think he did anything to really

63
00:06:05,005 --> 00:06:09,526
move the story they were trying to tell along.
I think it was a very character saturated movie

64
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:14,227
already. And I think those characters did a
fantastic job of advancing the story they were

65
00:06:14,247 --> 00:06:19,149
trying to tell. I hope to see him more. I hope
to see him in future movies. I just don't think

66
00:06:19,189 --> 00:06:23,395
he belonged in this one and I'm glad they pulled
the scene. Yeah, I thought Barry Keegan did

67
00:06:23,435 --> 00:06:28,019
a fantastic job as the Joker. I thought that
take on the Joker was really, really super

68
00:06:28,059 --> 00:06:32,763
interesting. But again, it really didn't service
the story. Just like John said, what do you

69
00:06:32,783 --> 00:06:37,767
think will come first? A sequel to the Batman
or a sequel to the Joker? Like, when do you

70
00:06:37,787 --> 00:06:42,171
think we'll see this character again? Oh, snap.
That's a good question. I feel like a sequel

71
00:06:42,191 --> 00:06:46,875
to the Joker will come up sooner because I feel
like Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix have

72
00:06:46,895 --> 00:06:51,827
been working on that for a while. Honestly,
though. I don't know if I need a sequel to

73
00:06:51,847 --> 00:06:56,391
the Joker. In fact, I know I don't. I'm really
hoping we get to see a sequel to the Batman

74
00:06:56,891 --> 00:07:00,895
and never see a sequel to the Joker. I think
that's a great standalone story. Just let that

75
00:07:00,975 --> 00:07:05,539
one exist on its own. Yeah, I think I agree
with that for sure. Great answer, Rick. Our

76
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:11,845
final honorable mention goes to Jacob Bell,
who said. Hey guys, this is Jacob Bell. I may

77
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:16,849
have submitted this answer too late, but either
way, I think it should have been in the movie.

78
00:07:17,582 --> 00:07:21,327
I think it was a great scene and I think ultimately
the reason it should have been in the movie

79
00:07:21,347 --> 00:07:27,695
is because that kind of scene would have been
in the comics. Like if that movie was a comic

80
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:33,882
or whatever, that kind of scene would have been
in the comic absolutely and that's just how

81
00:07:33,922 --> 00:07:38,102
the source material is so I think it should
have been in the movie. Yeah, I'm old enough

82
00:07:38,122 --> 00:07:42,645
to remember back when they did like novelizations
of these comic book superhero films and they

83
00:07:42,665 --> 00:07:47,128
would always have like extra scenes. They still
may make these books. I'm actually not sure.

84
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:51,451
But yeah, this feels like this scene would have
been in one of those stories, just one of those

85
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:55,974
extra scenes and definitely in a comic book,
because, you know, in comics, you're not limited

86
00:07:56,134 --> 00:08:01,218
by time like you are in a film. You're limited
by page counts. Right. Exactly. But you're

87
00:08:01,238 --> 00:08:06,861
also allowed to tell a really long story over
a span of a month over a year rather than just.

88
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:12,066
within a few hours. I did really like the scene
as I mentioned last week when we talked about

89
00:08:12,106 --> 00:08:16,870
it. I thought it was a fantastic scene that
really did justice to the Joker and portrayed

90
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:21,534
him in a way that we haven't seen him in a really
long time on film. Just like literally the

91
00:08:21,594 --> 00:08:26,137
smartest guy in the room and just like a total
psychological threat for Batman. Yeah thanks

92
00:08:26,157 --> 00:08:30,941
Jacob Bell. A lot of great answers here. We
want to give big thanks to Wilfright, Bodhi,

the time to visit our website. Click that record

for this week goes to Benjamin Alves who said

95
00:08:43,647 --> 00:08:49,151
Hey John and Joe, so I think the Joker scene
should have been in the movie because like

96
00:08:50,152 --> 00:08:57,877
it gave out too much of the story and it like,
I don't know, I feel like it would be better

97
00:08:58,057 --> 00:09:05,206
if the Joker just wasn't in this movie or like
they teased it with um the Joker card like

98
00:09:05,226 --> 00:09:10,149
in Batman Begins. Like, yeah, that's it. Bye
guys. Yeah, honestly, I think I would have

99
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:14,251
been happier with like a Joker tease, maybe
not the card, because we've already had that,

100
00:09:14,631 --> 00:09:20,915
than the scene that we got in the movie. The
deleted scene, I agree with Benjamin, did reveal

101
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:27,118
too much of the story. Like the Joker gave away
that the Riddler's motive was vengeance before

102
00:09:27,158 --> 00:09:32,721
we would have even known that, right? And the
fact that he was able to figure it out so quickly.

103
00:09:33,182 --> 00:09:39,424
ahead of Batman just made Batman look like he
wasn't that smart. And that scene kind of took

104
00:09:39,444 --> 00:09:44,926
away from what made the scene between Batman
and the Riddler so special in Arkham. Right,

105
00:09:44,986 --> 00:09:49,728
right. Those scenes took place like in almost
literally the same location, right? So it's

106
00:09:49,768 --> 00:09:55,091
hard not to compare both of them. And I really,
really liked Paul Dano's performance in that

107
00:09:55,131 --> 00:09:59,873
scene. It was so haunting, so weird. But you
can also see the same thing about the Joker

108
00:09:59,913 --> 00:10:04,815
scene. So it wouldn't quite make sense to have.
two kinds of scenes that were so similar in

109
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:09,757
the same movie. I do wish they would have taken
the Joker completely out of the film and just

110
00:10:09,797 --> 00:10:14,339
saved him for later. And that's why Benjamin
Alvis gets this week's win. Yeah, congrats

111
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:18,141
Benjamin for winning this week's No Prize. If
you the listener want a shot at winning Giro

112
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:22,904
No Prize, stay tuned to later on this episode
when we'll be asking another question of the

113
00:10:22,924 --> 00:10:26,045
week. And now that that's done, on to the news!

114
00:10:31,822 --> 00:10:37,147
Okay, last week we learned that Sharon Stone
will be playing Victoria Cord, who I guess

115
00:10:37,207 --> 00:10:42,612
is the villain in the upcoming Blue Beetle movie
that will be starring Sholo Maritwenya. I'm

116
00:10:42,692 --> 00:10:46,556
really looking forward to this movie and I've
been wondering who the main villain was going

117
00:10:46,576 --> 00:10:52,241
to be and I'm actually really surprised to hear
that it's an original character named Victoria

118
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:58,214
Cord. Now it sounds like she is related to the
character Ted Cord. You know, either his mother

119
00:10:58,374 --> 00:11:03,137
or maybe his wife or something like that. Or
maybe a gender swap. It could be that too.

120
00:11:03,417 --> 00:11:08,740
Yeah, they may be gender swapping Ted Kord into
Victoria Kord, which would be interesting.

121
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,503
I would also hate it, but it would be interesting.
Ted Kord, if you're not familiar with him,

122
00:11:14,003 --> 00:11:19,426
is the second Blue Beetle, actually DC Comics'
first Blue Beetle, because Blue Beetle, of

123
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:24,869
course, is a legacy character that was taken
from Charlton Comics, which DC acquired in

124
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:30,851
the 80s. Yeah, Ted Kord's version of Blue Beetle
was like this inventor kind of gadgeteer type

125
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:36,656
character. He was the head of Kord Industries.
I'm wondering if Victoria is going to be the

126
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:41,161
head of Kord Industries in this upcoming movie.
And that's just speculation. But if that's

127
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:47,067
the case, I get heavy Catwoman movie vibes from
this casting, because of course, Sharon Stone

128
00:11:47,087 --> 00:11:51,651
was the villain in the Catwoman movie with Halle
Berry. You know, but also she was probably

129
00:11:51,731 --> 00:11:56,274
the best part of that movie in a way. I think
she's a fantastic actress. You know, I still

130
00:11:56,314 --> 00:12:03,359
remember her from films like Basic Instinct.
Did you say Basic Instinct? Of course, who'd

131
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:08,602
forget that? No, but I do think she should be
working more than she is. I know she was almost

132
00:12:08,642 --> 00:12:13,205
cast in a Marvel movie. Wasn't she almost going
to be cast as Janet Van Dyne? Yeah, before

133
00:12:13,245 --> 00:12:17,328
Michelle Pfeiffer got the role. See, I would
have loved to have seen Sharon Stone over Michelle

134
00:12:17,348 --> 00:12:21,834
Pfeiffer in that role, just so we could have.
Michael Douglas Sharon Stone reunion. But I

135
00:12:21,894 --> 00:12:26,095
really hope Victoria Cord is like Ted Cord's
sister or something like that and maybe they're

136
00:12:26,135 --> 00:12:31,917
both vying for the head of the company. Initially
when I heard about this casting I didn't know

137
00:12:31,937 --> 00:12:36,078
her name was Victoria Cord. I automatically
thought that she was going to play the character

138
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:41,800
Ladama from the Blue Beetle comics. She's like
a mob boss, this urban legend like no one is

139
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,761
quite sure if she's real or not and she's into
the occult. That's right she was in the recent

140
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:50,822
Cat Omen hunted animated movie that we reviewed.
Right yep. was her. And you know, for all I

141
00:12:50,842 --> 00:12:55,463
know, maybe that's secretly who Victoria Cord
is. Hopefully, let's not have a spoiler for

142
00:12:55,503 --> 00:13:01,105
anyone. But we'll see. I don't actually know
any of Blue Beetle's rogues gallery. Like,

143
00:13:01,165 --> 00:13:04,226
is there a character that you wish would have
been the villain of this instead of Victoria

144
00:13:04,286 --> 00:13:09,927
Cord? I mean, ultimately, Jaime Reyes, his Blue
Beetle scarab, has alien origins from this

145
00:13:10,087 --> 00:13:14,549
alien race known as the Reach. I imagine that
ultimately they will be the ultimate

146
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:24,139
occultism, Ladama will be involved with like,
I don't know, black market alien weaponry from

147
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:28,180
the Reach or something like that. And she wants
the scarab for herself. This is all speculation,

148
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,861
who knows. But yeah, the Reach would make sense
for the character. If Sharon Stone turns out

149
00:13:32,881 --> 00:13:38,783
to not be like a version of Ladama and she actually
is a gender swapped version of Ted Kord, it

150
00:13:38,803 --> 00:13:44,384
would be interesting to see like a female version
of the Blue Beetle character. But if Ted Kord

151
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:48,005
is in the movie, well, that just brings us to
our question of the week.

it for all the news for this episode, so let's

158
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:25,060
go ahead and get into our main event. where
we review the latest Sony Pictures Spider-Man

159
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:26,705
Universe film, Morbius.

160
00:14:42,606 --> 00:14:47,909
Okay, so Morbius came out this past week, finally,
after being delayed several times from its

161
00:14:47,969 --> 00:14:55,013
initial July 2020 release date, largely due
to the COVID-19 pandemic. Like Venom and Venom

162
00:14:55,053 --> 00:14:59,696
Let There Be Carnage, the film is part of Sony's
Spider-Man universe that is adjacent to the

163
00:14:59,796 --> 00:15:05,659
MCU and indirectly associated with Spider-Man.
When the Morbius film was first announced,

164
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:10,758
I was bummed because, let's be real, Sony doesn't
know what they're doing. and they're only holding

165
00:15:10,798 --> 00:15:14,459
onto the Spider-Man film rights to make money,
not because they care about these characters

166
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:20,240
or about making great movies. So in this film
kept getting pushed back. Honestly, I didn't

167
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:25,782
really care. And my anticipation for it was
nonexistent. Oh, yeah, dude, you think yours

168
00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:33,004
was nonexistent. Mine was like beyond negative
nonexistent. Like if this film never came out,

169
00:15:33,204 --> 00:15:39,814
I would have been thrilled. Like I would joke.
that the movie was gonna be amazing and make

170
00:15:39,854 --> 00:15:43,216
trillions of dollars. And I was doing that ironically,
because honestly I didn't have any faith that

171
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:48,238
this film was gonna be good. My expectations
could not be lower unless I guess they were

172
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:53,400
yours. Right. But I think that was definitely
to the movie's benefit, because not only did

173
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:58,662
I find that the movie was not terrible, I thought
it was actually pretty decent, similar to how

174
00:15:58,702 --> 00:16:04,245
I found the first Venom film or the new Mutants.
So despite what I thought the movie would be

175
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:10,188
and how many critics are coming down on it,
I would in fact recommend the movie if you

176
00:16:10,228 --> 00:16:16,073
have even the slightest inclination to see it.
To me this is like a perfect streaming film,

177
00:16:16,193 --> 00:16:20,597
like don't pay extra to see it at least. But
check it out on streaming if you want to waste

178
00:16:20,697 --> 00:16:28,023
a couple of hours of your life. I mean also
check it out if you like vampire movies or

179
00:16:28,063 --> 00:16:33,707
if you like Jared Leto or Matt Smith or great
visual effects or if you're a fan of Morbius

180
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:38,870
as a character. There are plenty of reasons.
to watch this movie. And if you haven't seen

181
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:43,352
it, I would suggest stop listening to this review
because we're going to be discussing spoilery

182
00:16:43,432 --> 00:16:47,754
plot points from the movie, see the movie first,
then come back and compare your thoughts with

183
00:16:47,834 --> 00:16:52,276
ours. Now I'm not going to say that this is
a great film by any means, but in this day

184
00:16:52,316 --> 00:16:57,198
and age, it does seem like people will trash
something as a dumpster fire if it doesn't

185
00:16:57,338 --> 00:17:03,560
absolutely blow them away. And I'm like, let's
be realistic. Quality is a spectrum. It's not

186
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,735
black or white. There are plenty of middling
films out there. that could be worth your time

187
00:17:08,055 --> 00:17:13,660
depending on what your tastes are. Now Morbius
is not Avengers Infinity War, but it's not

188
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,923
Catwoman either. And I honestly think people
who know the character of Morbius in the comics

189
00:17:18,264 --> 00:17:23,568
would be hard pressed to come up with a much
better film for him given his backstory. Honestly

190
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:27,932
this is probably almost as good of a Morbius
film as you're gonna get where it has a PG-13

191
00:17:28,373 --> 00:17:32,957
rating and no Spider-Man involvement. Because
we both know changing either of those things

192
00:17:33,117 --> 00:17:38,111
would have made this better. Yeah, totally.
I mean, I've seen so much hate online for this

193
00:17:38,171 --> 00:17:47,473
movie. A lot of it for me, honestly. But after
having seen it, I don't get the hate from people

194
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:53,575
who have seen the movie, I guess. I mean, the
movie reminded me a lot of a superhero film

195
00:17:53,595 --> 00:17:58,536
from when I was a kid, you know, in the 90s
and early 2000s. Just check your brain at the

196
00:17:58,556 --> 00:18:02,637
door kind of entertainment, right? We get into
debates over the value of entertainment all

197
00:18:02,657 --> 00:18:07,939
the time. To me it comes secondary to story,
but Marvel fans can't seem to get enough of

198
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:13,380
it. Which is why I'm wondering why so many Marvel
fans have turned on this film. Like what kind

199
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:19,542
of film were you expecting with a character
like Morbius? Well I mean, the movie does have

200
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:24,263
a lot of issues. We'll definitely talk about
them as we go through this review. I'll start

201
00:18:24,283 --> 00:18:28,805
off by saying that the marketing of the film
was an utter shit show. Oh totally. Not only

202
00:18:28,845 --> 00:18:33,191
did the trailers fail to get people excited
for the movie, they didn't adequately represent

203
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:37,394
the movie. A lot of what you've seen in the
trailers ended up on the cutting room floor,

204
00:18:37,795 --> 00:18:42,699
including a lot of Jared Harris's role, Tyrese's
role, you know, there was no bionically enhanced

205
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:47,203
arm here, and the meeting between Morbius and
Michael Keaton's vulture, which I know a lot

206
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:50,846
of people were anticipating. Yeah, it really
makes you wonder what this movie would have

207
00:18:50,866 --> 00:18:55,450
looked like if it came out before No Way Home.
Right, they may have resulted in a lot of the

208
00:18:55,470 --> 00:19:00,642
changes here. Now, I try not to hold the marketing
of a film against the final product. But it's

209
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:06,747
clear that this movie got edited a lot. And
that may be a good thing after all, considering

210
00:19:06,787 --> 00:19:11,471
the movie was actually better than the trailers
made it out to be. I'm guessing the studio

211
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:16,715
identified and removed some of the film's early
problems, which is good, but yeah, it's cut

212
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:22,720
up. And the movie is not long either because
of that. It's only about an hour and 44 minutes

213
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,544
and it moves at a pretty brisk pace. And in
a way, I would almost describe this film as

214
00:19:27,584 --> 00:19:34,356
the anti-The Batman. where nothing lasts longer
than necessary. And I think a lot of people

215
00:19:34,636 --> 00:19:39,963
that did not like the Batman will probably really
like this film. Well, I think a Venn diagram

216
00:19:40,123 --> 00:19:47,473
of people who think that and also like ate paste
as a child is like a perfect circle. Ha ha

217
00:19:47,493 --> 00:19:47,573
ha.

218
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:57,416
I guarantee you they do. Uh, no, I mean, I don't
think the movie is quite as dumb as you're

219
00:19:57,556 --> 00:20:02,700
portraying it. You know, when I did a deep dive
of reading into the character of Morbius during

220
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:09,826
our duel episode where we pit him against Manbat,
I found that Morbius is one of Marvel's most,

221
00:20:09,886 --> 00:20:15,651
if not the most tragic character because not
only has he experienced a lot of the tremendous

222
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:20,814
loss and unbearable circumstances that a lot
of heroes go through. Specifically, he was

223
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:26,316
like a good man and doctor who became a monster
compelled to kill. He can't control himself,

224
00:20:26,677 --> 00:20:32,279
he can't cure himself, and because of his healing
factor, he can't die, not even from traditional

225
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:37,561
weapons due to his technically non-supernatural
status. So he lives as this pitiable soul in

226
00:20:37,581 --> 00:20:42,543
the comics who tries to make the best of his
situation by combating evil. And I felt that

227
00:20:42,564 --> 00:20:48,430
if this movie was going to be any good, it really
had to convey that tragic theme. of being forced

228
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:54,495
into essentially committing murder in order
to live. And while elements of that were here,

229
00:20:54,875 --> 00:21:00,420
I think this film addressed the issue mostly
indirectly. The only innocent people he killed

230
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,144
were on the boat, and their innocence kind of
is up for speculation given that they were

231
00:21:05,204 --> 00:21:09,307
mercenaries. Yeah, the film basically went out
of its way to tell you that, hey, these guys

232
00:21:09,347 --> 00:21:13,898
probably deserve to die. Yeah. Yeah, they're
not good guys. But to the film's credit, it

233
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:20,481
did introduce some interesting devices to Morbius's
mythology. One of which was like the synthetic

234
00:21:20,521 --> 00:21:26,583
blood. And that kind of served as like a ticking
time bomb in the movie, where once that temporary

235
00:21:26,623 --> 00:21:32,586
solution had run its course, he would become
the uncontrollable murderer. But also in this

236
00:21:32,646 --> 00:21:37,868
movie, if he didn't drink the synthetic blood
and he drank real blood, he would also become

237
00:21:37,968 --> 00:21:43,482
uncontrollable, like go into this bloody drunken
rage. So it was tricky. And then of course,

238
00:21:43,682 --> 00:21:49,624
in this film, he also developed a means of killing
vampires like himself with that iron rich anticoagulant,

239
00:21:49,924 --> 00:21:54,586
which was pretty nice because he never came
up with that in the books. So while like this

240
00:21:54,646 --> 00:22:00,048
wasn't quite the story of an uncontrollable
killer, it did bring some interesting ideas

241
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:06,402
to the table to sidestep that. And the consequences
of his failure still felt very real. I think

242
00:22:06,422 --> 00:22:11,444
the film did a good job introducing what Morbius
would be like if things were taken to their

243
00:22:11,484 --> 00:22:16,466
worst. You know, we had Milo as an example.
Yeah, absolutely. He was essentially what the

244
00:22:16,506 --> 00:22:21,468
consequences would be. And it's just a cold,
ruthless killer. Morbius did not want to be

245
00:22:21,508 --> 00:22:25,970
that. And though he has resorted to drinking
the blood of innocents in the comic books from

246
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,931
time to time, you know, he started out as a
Spider-Man villain after all, his whole arc

247
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:35,073
has always involved trying to prevent that.
He feels extreme guilt over those vampiric

248
00:22:35,133 --> 00:22:40,153
actions. So at least they captured that in this
movie. But I think what surprised me most about

249
00:22:40,213 --> 00:22:44,736
this film was the quality of its special effects,
actually. Because I didn't think they'd be

250
00:22:44,756 --> 00:22:50,220
very good from the trailers. Specifically though,
in the quality of its body effects. The visual

251
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,683
effects that were around during the time of
Captain America, the first Avenger, we've gone

252
00:22:54,863 --> 00:22:59,767
way past that. Because in that movie, like the
pre-serum Steve Rogers, sometimes looked like

253
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:03,469
Chris Evans disembodied head on a scrawny dude's
shoulders, you know? Wait, like Bobblehead?

254
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:09,253
Yeah, yeah, the scenes of like Jared Leto like
laying on the table in the freighter. That

255
00:23:09,273 --> 00:23:14,235
was seamless. I was like, dang, like Jared Leto
must not have eaten for like a few months to

256
00:23:14,436 --> 00:23:18,418
do that scene. You know, and he's done stuff
like that for roles, but it seems like he may

257
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:22,560
not have to do that ever again because the special
effects are so good here. They can make actors

258
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,103
bodies look like whatever they want to. He went
from an emaciated guy in the beginning to like

259
00:23:27,203 --> 00:23:32,838
a male underwear model without really any suspension
of disbelief. Oh, yeah, totally. I think the

260
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:38,242
seamless and subtle way Morbius and Milo would
transform into their vampire forms was also

261
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:43,367
really impressive and kind of disturbing even.
Like Matt Smith's vampire face in particular

262
00:23:43,407 --> 00:23:47,890
was the stuff of nightmares for me. Like so
much so that when the camera would linger on

263
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:53,455
it, I'd get uncomfortably creeped out. But also,
I think that's as far as the great special

264
00:23:53,495 --> 00:23:57,498
effects went. I don't know if I would agree
with you in saying that this film's special

265
00:23:57,518 --> 00:24:01,221
effects were that great. It was a little cartoonish.
I think they could have taken it a step further.

266
00:24:01,654 --> 00:24:05,756
Well, I mean like when they weren't actively
flying around and smashing into things. I think

267
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:10,458
their look was really well done. Let's go ahead
and move into the character breakdown. Starting

268
00:24:10,518 --> 00:24:15,741
with Michael Morbius who is played by Jared
Leto. And let me start off by saying I can't

269
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:21,404
stand Jared Leto. The guy is pretentious as
fuck. He almost ruined the concerts that I

270
00:24:21,444 --> 00:24:26,187
went to at Red Rocks. I won't get into it, but
he was really drunk and made like the audience

271
00:24:26,207 --> 00:24:30,189
sing all the words to his 30 seconds to Mars
songs. Yes, I don't have too much against the

272
00:24:30,209 --> 00:24:35,851
guy. I feel like You've been hanging that over
his head for as long as I can remember. Honestly,

273
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:40,412
though, I thought he was perfect for this role.
I thought he did a fantastic job as Morbius.

274
00:24:40,892 --> 00:24:44,333
Yeah, I mean, the guy can act no matter how
I feel about him. You know, outside of the

275
00:24:44,373 --> 00:24:49,555
Joker, I should say. I think he's a fantastic
actor and, you know, he has the accolades to

276
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:54,696
prove it. From Rokuiem for a Dream and Dallas
Buyers Club. I was very satisfied with his

277
00:24:54,756 --> 00:24:59,022
performance here, and I really liked him in
the role as much as I didn't want to. He just

278
00:24:59,042 --> 00:25:04,747
has a very subtle acting technique that is pretty
effective, I think. I think it helps in the

279
00:25:04,787 --> 00:25:10,211
fact that Jared Leto is a literal vampire, and
the fact that he's 50 years old and looks like

280
00:25:10,231 --> 00:25:14,936
he's 29. Yeah, he's definitely been drinking
the blood of innocence or something like that.

281
00:25:14,976 --> 00:25:19,860
Yes, yes. There's no other explanation. Now
in regards to the character, I think Morbius

282
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:24,224
is probably one of the easier characters to
get right in terms of motivation, because it's

283
00:25:24,284 --> 00:25:29,332
very straightforward. You know, he develops...
the experimental bat treatment because he wants

284
00:25:29,412 --> 00:25:34,257
to live essentially, and then he becomes a pseudo
vampire and fights evil because it's the only

285
00:25:34,297 --> 00:25:41,103
way his conscience can tolerate his murderous
nature. Here it's more about stopping one evil,

286
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:46,008
in particular his best friend Milo, who took
the serum he developed and so he feels some

287
00:25:46,048 --> 00:25:50,832
responsibility in stopping. So the main storyline
is easy to understand where he's coming from,

288
00:25:51,152 --> 00:25:55,967
but at the end of the movie... It wasn't quite
clear what his plan was in regards to his thirst

289
00:25:56,087 --> 00:26:00,769
now that the synthetic blood was ineffective,
or what his plan in general was, whether it

290
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:05,971
was to look for a new treatment, or become an
anti-hero, or what. Now yeah, the movie really

291
00:26:06,091 --> 00:26:11,994
started and ended with Milo. Once that whole
arc was wrapped up, the movie ended pretty

292
00:26:12,074 --> 00:26:18,216
abruptly. Yeah, for sure. I guess, ultimately,
he's joining the Sinister Six, but like, who

293
00:26:18,236 --> 00:26:23,982
knows what their goals are outside of defeating
Spider-Man? who I'm not even sure exists within

294
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:28,903
this universe. Well, Morbius seemed to know
who he was. Yeah, he didn't question it. But

295
00:26:28,943 --> 00:26:33,725
also he didn't really say anything to the vulture
at the end of the movie besides interesting.

296
00:26:35,785 --> 00:26:40,927
Isn't this weird? It was a bizarre edit of like
a last minute reshoot or something, it was

297
00:26:40,987 --> 00:26:45,028
bizarre. We'll probably talk more about the
end credit scenes later. But back to Morbius,

298
00:26:45,408 --> 00:26:50,949
I thought the portrayal of his powers was interesting.
Like they substituted his enhanced senses in

299
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:56,856
the comics. with echolocation, which is not
a power that Morbius has in the source material,

300
00:26:56,956 --> 00:27:01,778
even though it probably should be. You know,
in the books, he can smell things very acutely,

301
00:27:02,178 --> 00:27:08,140
he can see in the dark and in various wavelengths,
but in the film, it was all about sound, which

302
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:12,982
gave him this radar sense, which I think totally
works thematically due to his bad nature. And

303
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:18,324
I think they probably should adopt that power
for him in the comics. Yeah, Marvel seems to

304
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:22,806
have pretty good synergy between their movies
and their comics. if they didn't go this route.

305
00:27:23,146 --> 00:27:27,389
Yeah, I think it would be totally apt. And I
thought it was interesting how they portrayed

306
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:32,391
the echolocation visually in this movie, where
everything kind of moved with a smoke trail

307
00:27:32,712 --> 00:27:37,494
and the things that he focused on seemingly
gave off like a sort of smoke signal. I thought

308
00:27:37,514 --> 00:27:42,717
it was pretty neat and very unlike how Daredevil's
radar sense has been visually portrayed. I

309
00:27:42,857 --> 00:27:47,700
didn't like the way this was portrayed. Just
making everything cloudy didn't make sense

310
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:52,598
to me because sound isn't really like a cloud.
I think they could have done it differently,

311
00:27:52,998 --> 00:27:57,500
but at least it's different, you know, from
anything else we've seen. I think it didn't

312
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,543
100 percent click with me until like toward
the end of the movie when he was gliding through

313
00:28:02,563 --> 00:28:07,605
the city to save Martine. And like he could
kind of sense her blood visually floating through

314
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:11,566
the air, like he was sensing it as the sound
waves bounced back to him. And that's how he

315
00:28:11,587 --> 00:28:15,848
was perceiving it. It was almost like she smelled
or something like that, you know, like you

316
00:28:15,868 --> 00:28:20,926
could smell her blood, maybe. Yeah, something
like that. The smoke kind of represented multiple

317
00:28:20,946 --> 00:28:24,827
senses in that regard. In the movie posters
and stuff like that, we saw like these waves

318
00:28:24,907 --> 00:28:29,249
emanating from him. I thought that would have
been cooler. Well, we did see that briefly

319
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:33,630
when he was first explaining his echolocation.
We saw like the sound waves go out and then

320
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:39,752
come back. They use this interesting visual
cue where his eyes got cloudy whenever he would

321
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:44,933
use echolocation. Oh, and his ears rippled too.
Yeah, they became like furry or something.

322
00:28:45,093 --> 00:28:49,668
Gross. It's weird. I don't know if they needed
both of those visual cues, but, uh, cause the

323
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:55,192
ear thing was just kind of gross. It's like,
Ooh, my ears are tingling. I do like the way

324
00:28:55,232 --> 00:29:00,075
this movie explained the science of his bat
serum. Cause like in the books, you know, it

325
00:29:00,095 --> 00:29:06,399
was just like bat blood and electroshock, but
here he was like vampire bats evolved into

326
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:11,303
the only animals that feed entirely on blood
because of some kind of enzyme they have and

327
00:29:11,343 --> 00:29:17,170
blah, blah. Yeah. I totally thought that the
science behind this movie, was much easier

328
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:22,393
to understand and accept than the science from
the comics. Yeah. I love the vampirism angle

329
00:29:22,413 --> 00:29:26,835
that they took for this movie. It was really
well done, I thought. For some reason, I always

330
00:29:26,976 --> 00:29:32,098
like when they mix science with the supernatural,
kind of like Blade kind of explained why vampires

331
00:29:32,118 --> 00:29:36,941
need to drink blood and stuff like that. But
essentially in this movie, his treatment was

332
00:29:36,961 --> 00:29:42,944
like a chimeric merge of human and bat cells
that made this feel more like the Island of

333
00:29:42,964 --> 00:29:47,382
Dr. Moreau, but on a much more practical level.
Yeah, I love all the different adaptations

334
00:29:47,423 --> 00:29:51,325
that they made to make the character more modern
and accessible. If it was like the instead

335
00:29:51,345 --> 00:29:55,787
of being a stowaway on a ship, like he had to
go out and do this experiment in international

336
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:59,909
waters. I thought that was cool. Yeah. I love
the synthetic blood. That was really cool.

337
00:29:59,949 --> 00:30:03,671
And I love the look of the synthetic blood,
like how it was blue. You know, it was like

338
00:30:03,711 --> 00:30:08,154
this is the good stuff and the red stuff is
the danger stuff. Yeah, that's pretty cool.

339
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:15,318
Let's go to move on to Lucian, AKA Milo played
by Matt Smith. I thought Matt Smith. I didn't

340
00:30:15,338 --> 00:30:19,541
know what to think about him before this movie,
because he had a very small part in the trailers,

341
00:30:19,842 --> 00:30:23,605
but I thought he was a lot of fun here. I wasn't
expecting him to be any good at all, but he

342
00:30:23,645 --> 00:30:28,469
turned out to be actually one of my favorite
parts of the movie. He almost saves this movie

343
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:34,194
with how sinister of a villain he is. Oh totally.
I knew he was probably going to be my favorite

344
00:30:34,214 --> 00:30:39,779
part of the film going into it, and he absolutely
was. Yeah. I mean he killed a lot of people

345
00:30:39,819 --> 00:30:43,978
here, and he did it with like this sense of
superiority and glee. So you could totally

346
00:30:44,018 --> 00:30:48,942
see why he needed to be stopped. But the fact
that he and Morbius were best friends, almost

347
00:30:48,982 --> 00:30:53,505
brothers since childhood, it threw an interesting
dramatic element in there. Yeah, they also

348
00:30:53,525 --> 00:30:58,228
made him the benefactor of Morbius's research.
So it kind of threw another interesting twist

349
00:30:58,268 --> 00:31:02,732
in there as to like who really owned the research
and was he entitled to that serum? Yeah, for

350
00:31:02,772 --> 00:31:07,215
sure. It was a kind of relationship that you
don't see too much within these superhero stories.

351
00:31:07,235 --> 00:31:12,422
Like even going back to when they were kids,
I think Morbius... first called him Milo as

352
00:31:12,462 --> 00:31:17,505
like this way to detach from this new kid who
probably wasn't gonna live long as a friend,

353
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:22,488
you know? And the nickname stuck and towards
the end of the movie when Morbius finally killed

354
00:31:22,508 --> 00:31:27,691
him at the end, Milo was like, you can't kill
me, you gave me my name, you know? I thought

355
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:31,873
that was kind of deep, you know? There was like
some palpable weight to the tragedy of it.

356
00:31:32,193 --> 00:31:36,676
Yeah, you almost get the sense that Morbius
was like responsible for Milo's life in a way.

357
00:31:37,276 --> 00:31:41,791
Yeah. He definitely promised to cure him and
to save him. So when that ends up going bad,

358
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:46,234
it's very heartbreaking that he had to take
Milo's life. Yeah. And I think that aspect,

359
00:31:46,294 --> 00:31:51,157
you're right, did save the film and did add
some extra gravitas and some extra thematic

360
00:31:51,197 --> 00:31:56,521
weight that the film otherwise would not have
had. It is hard to know why Milo turned evil

361
00:31:56,561 --> 00:32:02,565
though, other than being corrupted by his newfound
power, which I think on its own is never a

362
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:07,769
great motivation. Well, it did explain that
he was perhaps bullied a bit more than Morbius

363
00:32:07,809 --> 00:32:13,443
was in their childhood. He was upset his whole
life that he was not able to do what others

364
00:32:13,483 --> 00:32:17,504
were able to do. He felt like, you know, others
were superior toward him or felt superior toward

365
00:32:17,524 --> 00:32:22,645
him. And finally, he was able to do everything
everyone else could do and more, you know,

366
00:32:22,806 --> 00:32:27,167
feel like what it's really like to be alive.
And I think he was just really taking out all

367
00:32:27,207 --> 00:32:32,468
those years of resentment for people who were
able to do things that he couldn't do on Innocence.

368
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:37,334
Yeah, totally. I guess his goal in the film
was to torture Morbius. by killing the ones

369
00:32:37,354 --> 00:32:42,879
he loved in order to convince him of their new,
like, primal nature. But it's hard to understand

370
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:48,723
what his plan was beyond that. I guess he wanted
him and Morbius to just rule over others as

371
00:32:48,763 --> 00:32:53,948
seemingly more evolved beings or something.
That wasn't clear. And it is hard to know when

372
00:32:54,268 --> 00:32:58,511
and how Milo took the serum though. Because
I don't remember a shot of him actually taking

373
00:32:58,611 --> 00:33:03,656
one of the vials, do you? No. No, that was kind
of cheap, I felt. Actually really cheap. It

374
00:33:03,716 --> 00:33:07,787
did make for a nice surprise though later on
in the movie. where he walks in with a bag

375
00:33:07,827 --> 00:33:11,089
of blood and it's like, oh, that's nice, you
know, he's like helping his boy out with a

376
00:33:11,109 --> 00:33:14,611
bag of blood. And then he walks out without
his cane and everything like that. That was

377
00:33:14,631 --> 00:33:18,914
kind of like a shock. I was like, wait. You
actually thought that was a really well written

378
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:24,498
and well done reveal. Like once you understood
the significance of that cane, like it really

379
00:33:24,579 --> 00:33:30,243
got you. Yeah, for sure. I do have to say that
like this kind of sold me on Matt Smith as

380
00:33:30,303 --> 00:33:34,762
John Constantine. I can see that. With like
the trench coat and like the hair. And the

381
00:33:34,882 --> 00:33:39,043
accent, I think it could work. He could totally
pull it off for sure. But he has that real

382
00:33:39,083 --> 00:33:43,464
creepy bone structure about him too, you know?
I think that's why he'll be good in the Game

383
00:33:43,484 --> 00:33:47,505
of Thrones spinoff. Right. What's interesting
about the Milo character is that in the comics,

384
00:33:47,905 --> 00:33:52,486
Morbius's best friend was named Emil. And he
was a healthy kid, a neighborhood best friend,

385
00:33:52,806 --> 00:33:57,648
who became a scientist just like Morbius to
try and save him. And you know, he helped him

386
00:33:57,728 --> 00:34:02,749
administer his initial bat serum, and he was
the first person Morbius killed right after

387
00:34:02,769 --> 00:34:08,324
turning into a vampire. In this movie, though,
Milo was like an amalgamation of Emil from

388
00:34:08,344 --> 00:34:14,008
the books and Loxious Crown, who was a hydro-scientist
that became the villain Hunger, who was another

389
00:34:14,068 --> 00:34:19,772
pseudo-vampire like Morbius. But turning Morbius'
friend into the main villain was, I thought,

390
00:34:19,872 --> 00:34:24,295
a great change from the source material. I thought
it worked really well. Yeah, I like this more

391
00:34:24,435 --> 00:34:29,739
than what you explained in your Morbius bio.
Yeah. Let's move on to Martine Bancroft, who

392
00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:33,998
was played by Adria Arjona. I don't know if
I'm pronouncing that last name right. But I

393
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:38,881
don't think I've seen Adria in anything before,
but I thought she was perfectly fine here as

394
00:34:38,901 --> 00:34:43,985
a Martine. She didn't really have much to do
in the story except assist Morbius. I feel

395
00:34:44,025 --> 00:34:48,488
the movie dropped the ball on their romance.
Because you know in the books, Morbius and

396
00:34:48,508 --> 00:34:54,171
Martine were actually engaged when Morbius first
took his bat serum. And here, they barely had

397
00:34:54,412 --> 00:34:58,494
any romantic relationship except for like a
kiss late in the movie and then the kiss right

398
00:34:58,534 --> 00:35:03,950
before she died, quote unquote died. I think
it would have been more tragic. when she died

399
00:35:03,990 --> 00:35:08,574
in his arms and he drank her blood and everything,
if that romance had been better established.

400
00:35:09,054 --> 00:35:14,058
Oh, absolutely. Like, why not make them romantic
partners right off the bat? I don't get that.

401
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:18,121
Maybe it's not professional? I don't know. I
don't know. I don't think I have too many qualms

402
00:35:18,141 --> 00:35:23,466
about professionalism or ethics in this film,
you know? That's true. Plus, it's not like,

403
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:27,489
you know, a married couple can't be colleagues.
That's entirely true, yeah. That's totally

404
00:35:27,509 --> 00:35:31,552
valid. In the comics, you know, Martine eventually
became more than just a pseudo-vampire. She

405
00:35:31,592 --> 00:35:36,352
became a real vampire turned by Dracula and
Morbius had to stake her through the heart

406
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:42,257
despite loving her. So it'll be interesting
how they treat Morbius and Martine's relationship

407
00:35:42,297 --> 00:35:47,181
going forward if the Morbius franchise continues.
I mean we'll definitely see the character again.

408
00:35:47,522 --> 00:35:51,565
I wonder if we'll end up seeing another Morbius
movie again though. Yeah, who knows. We'll

409
00:35:51,605 --> 00:35:55,208
see. There aren't too many other characters
to talk about in our character breakdown, but

410
00:35:55,388 --> 00:35:59,952
let's go ahead and move on to Simon Stroud who
is played by Tyrese Gibson and Al Rodriguez

411
00:35:59,972 --> 00:36:04,572
who is played by Al Madrigal. You know, the
FBI agents here were pretty generic, but at

412
00:36:04,592 --> 00:36:11,097
least they seemed fairly competent as investigators.
Tyrese's character, Simon Stroud, I don't remember

413
00:36:11,157 --> 00:36:17,022
him having a cybernetic arm in the Morbius comics
I read. I could be wrong, but I am really glad

414
00:36:17,062 --> 00:36:21,045
that they cut that whole element from the film
since it seems like it would have essentially

415
00:36:21,065 --> 00:36:26,030
been needless. Yeah, it seemed like they cut
a lot of him out. It definitely seemed like

416
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,793
there was a lot more to the character than what
we saw, even with like the scar across his

417
00:36:29,853 --> 00:36:33,687
neck and stuff like that. It felt like there
was stuff missing for sure. Do you feel like

418
00:36:33,747 --> 00:36:38,849
the movie suffered because that wasn't in the
film, though? No, not at all. Honestly, I'm

419
00:36:38,869 --> 00:36:43,471
not even sure his character was necessary. I
think I liked Agent Al more. Yeah. And considering

420
00:36:43,491 --> 00:36:47,292
there was like very little humor within the
film, I almost could have used a little bit

421
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:53,875
more of like a buddy dynamic between the two
investigators. Maybe. Finally, let's move on

422
00:36:53,915 --> 00:37:00,277
to Dr. Emil Nicholas, who is played by Jared
Harris. Jared Harris, fucking brilliant actor.

423
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:05,966
completely wasted in this role, or rather in
this cut of the film. You know, the trailers

424
00:37:06,006 --> 00:37:11,631
seem to imply that he was sort of a mentor to
Morbius, like advising him regarding the ethics

425
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:16,715
of his bat serum treatment, and then later on
influencing him to become a hero. But that

426
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:21,819
was all edited out here, and you know, he basically
just served as the father figure to these two

427
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:26,023
characters. But I don't think you needed an
actor of Jared Harris's caliber for what turned

428
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:31,279
into a pretty small and relatively unsubstantial
role. Right. His death was pretty tragic, although

429
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:35,963
I'm really wondering why Morbius didn't go into
a bloodlust when he came to rescue him. I'm

430
00:37:35,983 --> 00:37:40,207
surprised he didn't drink his blood like he
did Martins, you know? It was so strange, like

431
00:37:40,287 --> 00:37:44,611
his death scene was one of the rare instances
in which we actually saw blood in this movie.

432
00:37:44,871 --> 00:37:50,096
For a vampire film, it was relatively bloodless.
Like I remember on the ship scene, there was

433
00:37:50,536 --> 00:37:55,080
a part where Morbius straight up slashed this
dude across his throat. And the dude's like

434
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:59,243
going, oh, like... expecting there was gonna
be like blood squirting out in the special

435
00:37:59,263 --> 00:38:03,084
effects or something like that. Nope. And maybe
there was practically, but you know, either

436
00:38:03,124 --> 00:38:07,386
way they either cut it out or just didn't include
it. And he's like holding his throat and just

437
00:38:07,426 --> 00:38:11,227
kind of like falling to the ground. No blood.
I thought it was kind of funny. I wouldn't

438
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:16,389
have minded if it was rated R. Like I think
if you're gonna do a villain movie like Morbius,

439
00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:21,672
a character who does kill and a character that
is involved with blood, why not make it rated

440
00:38:21,812 --> 00:38:27,326
R? Producer Avi Arad, he just likes those PG-13
dollars. Yeah, he's a douche. I think all vampire

441
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:31,670
movies should be rated R essentially, just like,
cause if you can't show the blood, you're getting

442
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:36,334
away from one of the main themes of vampires,
you know? Right. Yeah, totally. That does it

443
00:38:36,354 --> 00:38:40,358
for the character breakdown, let's go ahead
and move on to the story highlights. Now the

444
00:38:40,418 --> 00:38:45,423
film starts off in Costa Rica where we see Morbius
and a local team set up a trap for a shit ton

445
00:38:45,503 --> 00:38:50,507
of vampire bats. Now I remember from the trailers
I thought this was like the process that would,

446
00:38:50,607 --> 00:38:54,963
you know, turn them into a part bat creature,
but... No, it was just them capturing bats.

447
00:38:55,003 --> 00:38:59,206
It was very dramatic for what it was though.
Oh, totally. I guess he cut his hand to like

448
00:38:59,426 --> 00:39:03,849
wake them up. Yeah, so they could smell his
blood. It was all very ritualistic. You'd think

449
00:39:03,869 --> 00:39:08,693
that they'd just grab some donated blood or
something to get the same effect, but. Or just

450
00:39:08,773 --> 00:39:13,376
fucking wait for them to fly it out of the cave
at night. I don't know. I guess the pilot did

451
00:39:13,416 --> 00:39:18,039
seem pretty spooked about staying there too
long. Yeah. From there, the film flashes back

452
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,430
to Greece when Morbius was a child staying at
the hospital. I thought it was an effective

453
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:27,992
flashback scene, like it really set up well
the relationship between him and Milo, aka

454
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:32,574
Lucian, and how much they cared about each other,
like how he wrote him that note, and then that

455
00:39:32,634 --> 00:39:37,996
note meant everything to Lucian. We get a brief
scene of Morbius winning the Nobel Prize and

456
00:39:38,016 --> 00:39:42,919
then turning it down, and at the hospital we
see that Morbius is testing out a serum with

457
00:39:42,959 --> 00:39:48,201
bad DNA. He meets with Milo because the tests
are successful, and he goes and administers

458
00:39:48,221 --> 00:39:52,603
it himself in international waters. on a ship
with a bunch of mercenaries. It was kind of

459
00:39:52,643 --> 00:39:56,827
weird, like how all these mercenaries were just
walking around the ship with their guns and

460
00:39:56,847 --> 00:40:01,070
everything like that. Like they were expecting
an attack of some sort to happen at any moment.

461
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:06,594
Yeah, were they like pirates? Yeah, it was strange.
Like that one mercenary guy who discovered

462
00:40:06,634 --> 00:40:10,797
Morbius, like hanging up on the ceiling like
a bat, he walked in with like his gun drawn

463
00:40:10,817 --> 00:40:14,160
and everything like that. I'm like, who are
you expecting to shoot in this situation? You

464
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:18,270
were working with a couple of doctors, like
the fuck? Well, they didn't even explain that

465
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:22,132
they were mercenaries until like after they
were all dead. I thought they were just like

466
00:40:22,192 --> 00:40:26,654
crew members just carrying guns for some reason.
I was like, what? I thought there was some

467
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:30,916
kind of like security detail, which, you know,
they were. But yeah, strange. It was kind of

468
00:40:30,956 --> 00:40:35,858
like a good monster movie kind of scene, though,
when he killed all those guys. I think it wanted

469
00:40:35,878 --> 00:40:41,400
to be a good monster movie scene. It was fine
for what it was. So Morbius abandons the boat

470
00:40:41,561 --> 00:40:46,643
by jumping into the water, and I guess. Swimming
to shore because he can swim faster than the

471
00:40:46,663 --> 00:40:51,525
Coast Guard can pull them back to Long Island
Fucking swim. It's a long fucking swim for

472
00:40:51,545 --> 00:40:56,267
sure, but you know, he's superhuman now I guess
so he knows he could pull it off. He looked

473
00:40:56,287 --> 00:41:01,549
at himself in the mirror is like yeah, I can
make this swim I got this See these apps these

474
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:09,212
are made for swimming So he swims back to his
lab and then starts testing his symptoms he

475
00:41:09,232 --> 00:41:14,715
finds that he has these superhuman powers and
he begins testing the limits of his thirst.

476
00:41:15,395 --> 00:41:20,238
Milo pays him a visit and sees that Morbius
has essentially cured himself, although Morbius

477
00:41:20,258 --> 00:41:25,321
sees it more as a curse. You often have to wonder
in movies like this, like why didn't Morbius

478
00:41:25,341 --> 00:41:31,084
just tell Milo right off the bat, like, dude,
I'm drinking blood, it's not cool. I don't

479
00:41:31,124 --> 00:41:37,067
want this for you also. Like he was so vague.
It's like, just be honest. Well, Milo already

480
00:41:37,087 --> 00:41:41,349
knew that. He's the one that got him the blood
to drink when he had isolated himself in that

481
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:45,729
room. That's fair. That's fair. Milo knew what
he was getting into. He knew what he was going

482
00:41:45,749 --> 00:41:51,394
to turn into. Maybe he even wanted that. He
just wanted those abs. He was like, yeah, I

483
00:41:51,414 --> 00:41:57,980
had to drink blood, but also I could wash my
clothes on my stomach. There you go. I would

484
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:04,666
do it for those abs. Sure. Crazy. So the FBI
begins investigating the boat incident and

485
00:42:04,766 --> 00:42:09,770
they deduce that Morbius was on the boat and
that he's probably involved. There's a scene

486
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:14,393
later where a nurse gets attacked in the hospital
hallway, which I thought was actually pretty

487
00:42:14,413 --> 00:42:19,817
damn effective. It was definitely inspired by
David F. Sandberg's Lights Out movie. Oh yeah.

488
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:25,501
But it was good, it was creepy. It was the creepiest
scene in the movie, yeah. Did you jump? Oh,

489
00:42:25,581 --> 00:42:33,506
hell yeah. Yeah. Did you jump? Hell no, hell
no. Shut up. You know you did. It was pretty

490
00:42:33,527 --> 00:42:38,818
effective for sure. But Morbius gets captured
by the police after a brief chase. and Milo

491
00:42:38,858 --> 00:42:43,961
visits him in jail and leaves a blood bag for
him and leaves his cane behind to signaling

492
00:42:44,001 --> 00:42:48,143
to Morbius that he had also taken the serum
and doesn't need the cane anymore. Morbius

493
00:42:48,263 --> 00:42:53,566
breaks out of jail to confront Milo about what
he had done and the two fight within the subway,

494
00:42:53,586 --> 00:42:57,469
which I thought was a pretty good scene. Yeah,
honestly, it was a pretty cool scene. And by

495
00:42:57,509 --> 00:43:01,911
this point in the film, I was still waiting
to hate Jared Leto. And I really recognized

496
00:43:02,311 --> 00:43:06,073
at this point that like, hey, this movie isn't
as terrible as I thought it would have been.

497
00:43:06,474 --> 00:43:10,895
Yeah, I think I realized that about halfway
through as well. Morbius flees their encounter

498
00:43:10,995 --> 00:43:15,856
and meets up with Martin and tracks down a bunch
of counterfeiters to create a new secret lab

499
00:43:15,896 --> 00:43:19,337
for himself. I thought that was kind of weird
because I don't think there's a whole lot of

500
00:43:19,617 --> 00:43:24,979
similarities between the equipment used to counterfeit
hundred dollar bills and to create medical

501
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:29,440
serums. You know, like, yeah, I mean, the whole
thing with him even finding the counterfeiters,

502
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:34,801
like them showing up to the restaurant was extremely
convenient. Yeah. That and the fact that he

503
00:43:34,841 --> 00:43:40,637
could use their equipment. Meanwhile, Milo goes
to a bar and gets into a bar fight and ends

504
00:43:40,677 --> 00:43:45,661
up attacking his assailants as they left. The
investigators end up finding the footage and

505
00:43:45,701 --> 00:43:51,066
release to the public that it's a different
vampire that is attacking everybody. Emil Nicholas

506
00:43:51,206 --> 00:43:56,771
confronts Milo and ends up getting killed by
him. As he's dying, Emil calls Morbius, who

507
00:43:56,811 --> 00:44:01,775
goes over and sees him die in his arms, and
realizes at that moment that Milo has also

508
00:44:01,815 --> 00:44:07,471
killed Martine. So Milo's just killing everybody.
Yeah. I mean, the scene with the detectives

509
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:12,554
looking at the CCTV, I thought that kind of
resolved that whole arc a little premature.

510
00:44:12,914 --> 00:44:17,437
Like you didn't really see those guys again.
Well, not until the end when they were chasing

511
00:44:17,497 --> 00:44:21,199
Morbius and Milo as they were fighting in the
streets down in the sewers. But they weren't

512
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:25,662
necessary to the story. Right. After that point.
But, you know, we're like at the end of the

513
00:44:25,702 --> 00:44:31,465
movie here, Morbius flies over to Martine and
kisses her. She bites his lip, which I thought

514
00:44:31,485 --> 00:44:36,372
was kind of kinky. She ingests some of his blood
and then he drinks her blood and I guess that

515
00:44:36,412 --> 00:44:40,674
whole process is what ends up turning her into
a vampire. I'm still wondering why she bit

516
00:44:40,714 --> 00:44:46,037
his lip. Like why? Because she's into that shit,
you know, don't hate, don't hate. It's like,

517
00:44:46,137 --> 00:44:51,520
oh I'm dying. I just gotta get some of that
flavor. She's passionate and kind of violent

518
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:56,263
and that would really hurt, I feel like. So
after he drinks her blood we get round two

519
00:44:56,303 --> 00:45:01,898
of Morbius versus Milo. This time the fight
goes down into the sewers. After crashing through

520
00:45:01,918 --> 00:45:04,800
a whole bunch of buildings and stuff like that.
I thought it was actually a pretty good fight

521
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:10,384
though, but Morbius ends up summoning this whole
army of bats again He can't do that in the

522
00:45:10,404 --> 00:45:17,769
comics, but here he used them as almost like
this Telekinetic force to hold Milo down as

523
00:45:17,809 --> 00:45:24,094
he injected him with like a vampire poison that
he created Yeah, this whole thing had me rolling

524
00:45:24,134 --> 00:45:31,182
my eyes big-time. Why really like he controls
bats now he could Communicate with bats and

525
00:45:31,222 --> 00:45:35,504
talk with bats well They kind of set that up
when he was like in his cylinder where the

526
00:45:35,544 --> 00:45:41,426
bats were and he was like kind of bonding with
them Yeah, they're my brothers. I guess but

527
00:45:41,486 --> 00:45:47,509
it is weird considering that Morbius had the
ability to control bats, but Milo didn't why

528
00:45:47,549 --> 00:45:52,311
is that like I thought they had the same powers?
Yeah Oh, that's very valid like why do they

529
00:45:52,351 --> 00:45:57,293
see Morbius as a brother, but not Milo but I
mean Milo had powers that Morbius didn't have

530
00:45:57,393 --> 00:46:03,237
either like the whole like Scream shockwave
thing. Well Morbius didn't do that, but I think

531
00:46:03,277 --> 00:46:07,921
he probably could have it was just like a using
the echolocation offensively Yeah, I think

532
00:46:07,961 --> 00:46:12,364
so too. I do think that Morbius looked pretty
fucking badass though when he was controlling

533
00:46:12,404 --> 00:46:17,368
those bats I just like the character design.
I feel like they were trying to rip off Batman

534
00:46:17,749 --> 00:46:22,833
Of course, you would think that like why wouldn't
you think that? Batman used bats against his

535
00:46:22,893 --> 00:46:27,837
enemies in Batman Begins and Morbius also used
the bats to cover his escape from the sewer

536
00:46:28,217 --> 00:46:33,411
if you noticed Yeah, of course I noticed that.
I was like, okay. That's essentially the end

537
00:46:33,431 --> 00:46:38,113
of the movie. We see him flying overhead and
we see that Martine is turning into a vampire.

538
00:46:38,874 --> 00:46:44,116
I was legit surprised how this movie ended.
I was like, what? Like, that's it? I knew there

539
00:46:44,136 --> 00:46:48,478
was some end credits scenes or mid credits scenes,
I should say, but I was like, wow, they like

540
00:46:48,558 --> 00:46:53,120
really just closed the curtain on us. Yeah,
it was fairly abrupt. So it's like the fight

541
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:58,834
ended, he flew away, done, credits. Totally
anti the Batman. Yeah, there could have been

542
00:46:58,874 --> 00:47:04,316
some resolution there for sure. Especially considering
how absolutely horrible these mid-credit scenes

543
00:47:04,336 --> 00:47:08,738
were. The first one actually started out pretty
cool because we saw the rift in the sky from

544
00:47:08,998 --> 00:47:14,000
Spider-Man No Way Home. And then Michael Keane
kind of like gets transported into a prison

545
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:19,903
cell. And his reaction to this is so fucking
bizarre. He's like, I hope the food's better

546
00:47:19,943 --> 00:47:25,485
here. Like, really? That's your reaction to
getting transported to a new cell, a new universe

547
00:47:25,525 --> 00:47:30,019
or something? Wouldn't you be like, What the
fuck? Where am I now? Where am I? I'm not supposed

548
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:35,062
to be here. Nothing like that. So weird. And
in the trailers, we know that there was a scene

549
00:47:35,142 --> 00:47:39,364
where Morbius and the Vulture actually met while
being transported by police and they had a

550
00:47:39,404 --> 00:47:45,008
conversation. They heavily edited that footage
just to show police taking him out of the cell

551
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:48,730
and putting him into a car as a news report
states that they don't know where this guy

552
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:52,752
came from. And since they have no record of
his crimes, they're going to let him go. I'm

553
00:47:52,792 --> 00:47:57,339
like, OK. And then it ends. That was pointless.
But then there's another mid-credits scene

554
00:47:57,579 --> 00:48:01,921
where it starts off basically kind of like a
car commercial and Morbius is driving through

555
00:48:01,981 --> 00:48:06,384
the countryside and then he pulls over, gets
out of his car, and then the Vulture flies

556
00:48:06,444 --> 00:48:11,147
over to him. Now I'm not sure how Adrian Toomes
managed to get a hold of this new wing suit,

557
00:48:11,487 --> 00:48:16,750
considering it was the Tinkerer that made it
for him, but he has a new suit here and he

558
00:48:16,770 --> 00:48:21,212
basically tells Morbius that he's not sure how
he got here, he thinks Spider-Man is involved,

559
00:48:21,252 --> 00:48:25,234
but he thinks they should team up to do some
good. and do some good, it makes me wonder

560
00:48:25,334 --> 00:48:31,356
if they're actually trying to make the Sinister
Six a group of good guys, or if quote, doing

561
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:36,397
some good, actually means something a little
bit more sinister. So little context. It was

562
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:40,658
a horrible end credit scene, like in a way that
doesn't even get me excited for what the future

563
00:48:40,698 --> 00:48:46,740
holds. In concept, I am very interested in a
movie that would combine this version of Morbius

564
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:50,721
with Tom Hardy's Venom, and Michael Keaton's
Vulture. I think that would be a cool movie.

565
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:54,747
I don't know who else they would add to the
Sinister Six. other than Craven, who's gonna

566
00:48:54,767 --> 00:48:59,270
have his own film that's coming up, and I have
no idea what they plan on doing with the group

567
00:48:59,591 --> 00:49:03,554
as a whole, but at least it would be cool to
see the actors work together. Well, it's like,

568
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:09,598
yeah, I mean, they set up the Scorpion in Spider-Man
Homecoming. I don't think he would have traversed

569
00:49:09,838 --> 00:49:15,302
the multiverse since he didn't know that Peter
Parker was Spider-Man the way that the Vulture

570
00:49:15,342 --> 00:49:20,198
did. Even that was kind of weird. Like, it's
like, okay, you know who Spider-Man is. So

571
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:25,081
for some reason you're transported to another
universe? It's like some people slipped through

572
00:49:25,361 --> 00:49:30,205
accidentally, kinda like how some other characters
slipped through into the MCU. I don't know,

573
00:49:30,325 --> 00:49:34,888
like they did a really piss poor job of explaining
it. It was just really bad. But we'll see how

574
00:49:34,928 --> 00:49:39,651
it all shapes up. I don't think that this franchise
is gonna die. I think they're gonna keep on

575
00:49:39,691 --> 00:49:45,575
building this Sinister Six kind of team up and
try to bring in Spider-Man into the mix. But

576
00:49:45,755 --> 00:49:51,078
that does it for this Morbius movie. I think
overall... I was surprised at how much I enjoyed

577
00:49:51,138 --> 00:49:56,280
it. I did find it entertaining. There are a
lot of issues with the movie. It is by no means

578
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:01,701
horrible. It's by no means good. It's very much
in the middle. It's a middling film. And for

579
00:50:01,721 --> 00:50:08,043
that, I give it three stars. Oh good, I was
so afraid you were gonna say like five stars

580
00:50:08,063 --> 00:50:11,984
from my review of the Batman. I mean, the Batman
should have got three stars too, but you know.

581
00:50:12,004 --> 00:50:19,330
Shut up. No, I think this was a perfect three
star film. The film is really basic and you

582
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:25,292
know, it was entertaining. It has very little
going for that beyond entertainment value.

583
00:50:25,712 --> 00:50:30,673
Maybe that's not entirely fair because I actually
really did like the angle between Morbius and

584
00:50:30,753 --> 00:50:38,335
Milo, but I don't think it was enough to warrant
a rating beyond three stars. Yeah. Ultimately,

585
00:50:38,395 --> 00:50:43,237
it's one half star lower than like the first
Venom film or something like New Mutants or

586
00:50:43,277 --> 00:50:49,019
Blade 2 or something like that, mainly because
it's obvious that this film was chopped up

587
00:50:49,059 --> 00:50:52,720
in the editing process. And because of that,
there were some story issues and some general

588
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:57,482
awkwardness regarding the cut. And those other
movies didn't really have that as much. But

589
00:50:57,523 --> 00:51:01,344

timing with this Morbius review. Yeah, it's

600
00:52:01,422 --> 00:52:05,804
almost like it was delayed to be just in time.
But no, we're talking about characters like

601

Joker vs. Green Goblin, Penguin vs. Vulture,
