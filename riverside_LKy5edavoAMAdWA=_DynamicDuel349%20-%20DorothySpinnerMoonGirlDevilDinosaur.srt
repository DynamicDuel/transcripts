1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,994 --> 00:00:30,155
Welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:35,777
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:36,217 --> 00:00:42,719
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous
Joe. And in this episode, we are doing a duel

5
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:48,440
between the characters Dorothy Spinner from
The Doom Patrol and Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur.

6
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:54,106
This is the final duel in lead up to our big
team duel next episode. where we're gonna pit

7
00:00:54,146 --> 00:00:59,527
the teams of Doom Patrol and Guardians of the
Galaxy against each other. Yeah, Dorothy Spinner

8
00:00:59,687 --> 00:01:06,169
and Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur are both little
girl superheroes with big monsters as backup,

9
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:10,210
basically. It'll be a lot of fun to break down
these characters. Moon Girl has a fantastic

10
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:15,392
backstory that I was really glad to dive into,
so can't wait to talk all about her and figure

11
00:01:15,472 --> 00:01:19,753
out who the heck's gonna win this matchup later
on this episode. Before that, we're gonna break

12
00:01:19,773 --> 00:01:25,060
down the comic book movie news to come out in
the past week. of which there isn't much due

13
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,165
to the ongoing strikes. There was like a 45
second Loki season 2 teaser, so we're going

14
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:35,290
to talk about that. Yeah and this episode is
actually sponsored by the Chronicle AI card

15
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:42,077
game that Jonathan and I invented. That's right,
we are sponsoring our own episode because we

16
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:46,764
can. it's our podcast. So we're going to talk
a little bit about the card game that Jonathan

17
00:01:46,784 --> 00:01:50,886
and I made. As always, we list our segment times
in our episode description, so feel free to

00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:06,114
the artificial life form for running extensive
duels, just a rather very intelligent simulator

21

the Commando Movie. versus Robocop.

38
00:03:56,566 --> 00:04:01,349
A No Prize is an award Marvel used to give out
to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Dual No Prize,

39
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:05,911
is a digital award we post on Instagram and
in our email newsletter for the person that

40
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:11,335
we feel gave the best answer to our question
of the week. We got a lot of great answers

41
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:16,738
this time. I think a total of eight people called
in. Unfortunately, we can only pick four answers

42
00:04:16,938 --> 00:04:22,442
and there were only really four answers to give
because the question last week was... What

43
00:04:22,482 --> 00:04:27,645
was your favorite Marvel or DC cartoon from
the 90s and why? I think the answers will be

44
00:04:27,705 --> 00:04:33,228
pretty obvious, but it'll be interesting to
see which one comes out on top. Our first honorable

45
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:38,070
mention goes to Dustin Balcom, who said, Hey,
dynamic duelist Dustin Balcom here and I am

46
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:45,054
jumping in right away to get my answer because
I'm not going to let these DC robots come out

47
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:51,310
and just say Batman the animated series because
it is good, but my gosh grow personality. The

48
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:57,254
real answer is the 90s Spider-Man cartoon because
it was just perfection. And that's all I got

49
00:04:57,274 --> 00:05:02,738
to say. That's right, Jonathan. Anyone who thinks
that Batman the Animated Series was the best

50
00:05:02,758 --> 00:05:08,362
cartoon of the 90s basically has no personality,
according to Dustin. And he's right. The best

51
00:05:08,402 --> 00:05:13,646
cartoon is actually Spider-Man, which was a
fantastic adaptation of the comic books. It

52
00:05:13,706 --> 00:05:17,248
introduced kids to a whole bunch of other Marvel
superheroes. There were a lot of crossovers

53
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:22,700
in that show. Killer opening theme song. and
the show gave us the first example of the Spider-Verse.

54
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:30,225
I dunno, sounds kinda boring to me. What? Yeah.
I mean, big whoop. You know you watched that

55
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:36,269
shit. I did, it was good I guess. Travis Herndon
and Lizzie Dyer Arnie also gave the answer

56
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:43,194
of the 90's Spider-Man cartoon. But Colby Hentges
gave this answer. Hey boys, Colby Hentges.

57
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:47,937
I know these are usually opinion questions and
there's no right or wrong answer, but this

58
00:05:47,977 --> 00:05:53,135
week is different. If you don't pick Batman,
the animated series, you're wrong. It's still

59
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:58,236
some of the best telling of some of Batman's
best stories. Kevin Conroy is Batman. Mark

60
00:05:58,256 --> 00:06:03,578
Hamill is Joker. It's the best. B-Taz or bust.
Now, Joseph, I've got to ask you, would you

61
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:13,561
rather be boring or wrong? Uh, I'd rather be
wrong, I guess. That's fine. You rag about

62
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:17,784
everything, so it makes sense. I love how passionate
this week's answers are for this question.

63
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:23,488
How the DC guys have no personality and how
the Marvel guys are just wrong. But they are

64
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:29,512
because the Batman animated series is so good
with the music, with the voice work, even with

65
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:35,217
the character adaptations. And so influential
in terms of what came after it for DC. You

66
00:06:35,237 --> 00:06:40,221
mean like the Superman show, Justice League?
Exactly. And even beyond that with the DC animated

67
00:06:40,261 --> 00:06:44,751
movie universe films. Yeah, the legacy of the
show is pretty lasting, I'll admit that. We

68
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:48,614
want to give a shout out to Ezra Garcia who
also gave the answer of Batman the Animated

69
00:06:48,654 --> 00:06:56,079
series. Our final honorable mention goes to
Scott Camacho who said, Johnny please do not

70
00:06:56,119 --> 00:07:01,463
change the color of my name. But when it comes
to this category, I'm going to have to side

71
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:05,686
with Marvel, mainly the X-Men series.

72
00:07:11,286 --> 00:07:19,453
banger of a soundtrack you cannot get any more
than the X-Men. Come on! That's right! Even

73
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:26,700
a DC fan can admit that the X-Men animated series
in the 90s was the best cartoon at that time.

74
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:32,725
Scotty mentioned the opening theme, which is
still the best theme in all of cartoons. His

75
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:38,446
brother, Gilly Macho, also gave the same answer
and made great points that... The show pretty

76
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:44,329
much defined the 90s as far as superheroes go
and it was highly influential in getting the

77
00:07:44,449 --> 00:07:50,132
X-Men movie made which in turn probably helped
kickstart the MCU. So you know the influence

78
00:07:50,313 --> 00:07:54,275
of the Batman animated series is one thing but
I think the influence of the X-Men animated

79
00:07:54,315 --> 00:07:59,758
series was even greater and you know it's coming
back on Disney Plus next year. I don't see

80
00:07:59,858 --> 00:08:04,261
Batman the animated series coming back. Well
they're trying to do it with Batman Kid Crusader.

81
00:08:04,821 --> 00:08:09,475
I don't know what that is. It's Bruce Timm's
new Batman cartoon. Come on, keep up. Why would

82
00:08:09,515 --> 00:08:16,830
I keep up with that? It's DC. Because DC's better.
Not according to Scotty. You know, I'm gonna

83
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:22,273
have to change him to Team Red on the Discord
from Team Blue. Scotty, let's strike one. Strike

84
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:27,295
one, my friend. Thanks to everyone for sending
in your answer, but the winner of this week's

85
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:33,818
No Prize is Brandon Estegard. Who said? I barely
make the cut off of a 90s skit. I'm also going

86
00:08:33,838 --> 00:08:38,320
with a show that barely makes a cut and that's
Batman Beyond. I don't think there's a wrong

87
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:42,842
answer to this question, but what's that's Batman
above the rest? is that it doesn't have to

88
00:08:42,882 --> 00:08:48,005
rely on storylines from the comics and can still
establish amazing episodes. It was a fresh

89
00:08:48,045 --> 00:08:54,648
and creative take on Batman with the updated
style from the OG animated series. Yes, Spider-Man,

90
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:59,311
Batman the animated series, the X-Men animated
series were all great, but when you think of

91
00:08:59,351 --> 00:09:04,433
Batman Beyond, it was almost like an amalgamation
of everything that made those other shows.

92
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:09,611
phenomenal. I guess you could say that because
you know, it had the cool animation style from

93
00:09:09,672 --> 00:09:14,233
Batman the Animated Series as Brandon mentioned,
but it also had, you know, the killer soundtrack

94
00:09:14,313 --> 00:09:18,835
like the Marvel cartoons did and more mature
plots and adult themes and things like that,

95
00:09:18,855 --> 00:09:23,857
you know? Yeah, absolutely. That was a DC cartoon
that I think even Marvel fans have to admit

96
00:09:24,077 --> 00:09:30,060
was insanely cool. It was almost like the Marvel
version of Batman, right? The fuck? Yeah, I'm

97
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:36,555
just gonna put that out there. Well, I'm not
agreeing with that. Now, for as good as Batman

98
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:43,019
Beyond was, I think X-Men actually was the clear
winner for this question. However, Brandon

99
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:47,443
was the only person to give the answer of Batman
Beyond, and he got points for originality with

100
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:52,786
this one, since we don't usually like to let
people share No Prizes, you know? Right. Congrats,

101
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:56,849
Brandon! You win this week's No Prize. If you,
the listener, want a shot at winning your own

102
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:01,412
No Prize, stay tuned to later on in this episode
when we'll be asking another Question of the

103
00:10:01,432 --> 00:10:04,572
Week. And now that that's done... Onto the news!

104
00:10:10,222 --> 00:10:14,183
Alright, there's not much news this past week
when it comes from Marvel and DC, but we did

105
00:10:14,243 --> 00:10:21,906
get a teaser of sorts for the upcoming Loki
Season 2 on Disney+, which is strange because

106
00:10:21,926 --> 00:10:28,228
we already got a full-on trailer for the show,
so it's kind of weird to get a 45 second teaser

107
00:10:28,868 --> 00:10:33,667
after the trailer. Usually that's flipped around.
But we did get some pretty interesting new

108
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:39,511
shots of what's going down in Loki season 2
starting October 6. Like we said with the trailer,

109
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:46,256
this all looks phenomenal. The cinematography
and the visual effects are movie level. In

110
00:10:46,296 --> 00:10:49,999
some cases, it looks even better than how the
movie looks, especially when it comes to the

111
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:54,842
set design and stuff. The teaser basically introduces
the concept that Loki is being pulled through

112
00:10:54,962 --> 00:11:01,127
space and time involuntarily. He meets up with
Sylvie, who... appears is hiding out in like

113
00:11:01,547 --> 00:11:07,590
McDonald's in the 1970s after the events of
season one where she Killed he who remains

114
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:12,053
and kickstarted the multiverse She still has
the really bad haircut But Loki and Sylvie

115
00:11:12,093 --> 00:11:16,736
joined forces here going up against Victor Timely
who we get some new shots of Jonathan Majors

116
00:11:16,816 --> 00:11:24,020
playing the character we also see Rhona Renslayer
from season one who in the comics is King of

117
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:30,104
the conquerors romantic interest She appears
to be in Victor Timely's timeline, and she's

118
00:11:30,124 --> 00:11:35,047
holding this futuristic laser gun type device.
Yeah, it makes me wonder whose side she's on.

119
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:39,410
Like, is she gonna try and stop Kang, or is
she gonna try and stop Loki? That's a great

120
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:46,075
question. My inclination is that she's on Kang's
side, and she's probably his only ally, especially

121
00:11:46,115 --> 00:11:52,459
since she was such a firm believer in the TVA
and its mission, even after she realized that

122
00:11:52,539 --> 00:11:59,435
the leaders of the TVA were just lifeless automatons.
True, yeah, true. I mean, for a teaser, it

123
00:11:59,475 --> 00:12:03,536
definitely teases. I don't know if I mentioned
this in our review of the latest trailer that

124
00:12:03,576 --> 00:12:08,839
came out, but Loki was my favorite thing to
come out of the post-Endgame era of the Marvel

125
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:14,481
universe, next to Shang-Chi. So I'm really looking
forward to this, really intrigued by the marketing

126
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:18,863
that they're putting out for it, even if it's
just a 45-second teaser. Yeah, I'm also super

127
00:12:18,903 --> 00:12:22,284
excited. We have less than a month before this
show comes out, and perhaps we'll get another

128
00:12:22,344 --> 00:12:27,394
full-length trailer before that time, but we'll
see. That does it for the news for this episode.

129
00:12:27,474 --> 00:12:33,117
Jonathan and I want to briefly remind listeners
that we created a card game for all you card

130
00:12:33,137 --> 00:12:38,559
gamers and tabletop gamers out there and board
gamers. Jonathan and I have a deck building

131
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:44,121
card game that we developed over the span of
10 years or so and we've been told that it's

132
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:49,804
really fun and we played it and we think it's
really fun. So if you guys are into that kind

133
00:12:49,844 --> 00:12:56,035
of stuff at all, visit ChronicleAIGame.com which
we will link in the show notes, and check out

134
00:12:56,055 --> 00:13:00,898
the card game. Jonathan and I put a lot of work
into it and would appreciate any and all support

135
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:06,562
you guys can give in that capacity. We do have
a Marvel versus DC version of this card game

136
00:13:06,863 --> 00:13:12,347
exclusive to patrons. So whether or not you
get the Chronicle AI version of the game, which

137
00:13:12,447 --> 00:13:18,431
is robot themed, or the Marvel versus DC version
of the game, which we called Infinity Crisis,

138
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:22,662
let us know if you pick it up and what you think
about it. We'd love for you to play it. We

139
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:26,530
think it's great, and we think you'll think
the same. But speaking of card games, that

140
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:28,233
brings us to our question of the week.

141
00:13:32,718 --> 00:13:40,161
To all the gamers out there, what is your favorite
non-video game, for Marvel or DC, and why?

142
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:45,443
You know, such as board games, card games, tabletop
games, anything physical like that you've played.

143
00:13:45,903 --> 00:13:50,345
Yeah, Jonathan and I are big fans of board games
and stuff like that, so largely this question

144
00:13:50,385 --> 00:13:54,066
is to help inform me, I think, about some of
the things that are out there that I may not

145
00:13:54,106 --> 00:13:58,848
know about that I would love to check out. So

16th.

151
00:14:27,414 --> 00:14:31,176
That does it for the news portion of this episode.
Now let's move on to the main event, where

152
00:14:31,236 --> 00:14:37,020
we find out who's going to win in a match between
the Doom Patrol's Dorothy Spinner against Moon

153
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,441
Girl and Devil Dinosaur.

154
00:14:53,718 --> 00:14:57,959
Okay, Dorothy Spinner against Moon Girl and
Devil Dinosaur. Of course, you'll be familiar

155
00:14:57,979 --> 00:15:03,520
with Dorothy Spinner if you've seen any of the
HBO Max Doom Patrol series, or I guess it's

156
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:08,882
just Max now. Phenomenal series. If you haven't
watched it, I definitely recommend it, especially

157
00:15:08,922 --> 00:15:14,003
season two, the season that Dorothy Spinner
is featured in. Yeah, Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur

158
00:15:14,043 --> 00:15:20,025
actually have their own show too on the Disney
Kids channel and on Disney Plus, which is actually

159
00:15:20,145 --> 00:15:26,227
incredible for a character that just came out.
in 2016. I think to go from non-existence when

160
00:15:26,347 --> 00:15:32,068
this podcast started to having a full-on show
of their own is a real testament to how cool

161
00:15:32,108 --> 00:15:36,249
the characters of Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur
are. I highly recommend the cartoon. It is

162
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:42,651
for kids, but it is highly inspired visually
by the Spider-Verse films. It's not 3D animated,

163
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:47,772
it's 2D, but there's a lot of cool stuff in
there that's very comic book-y. That's cool.

164
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:53,210
Is it Moon Girl or Devil Dinosaur or both that
were created in 2016? Well, Devil Dinosaur

165
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:59,353
dates back to the 1960s as a creation of Jack
Kirby. Oh wow. Moon Girl was created much more

166
00:15:59,373 --> 00:16:03,514
recently, and I go into that a little bit in
my history. In addition to the shows, you know,

167
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:07,776
also check out the comics. The Doom Patrol comics
are very highly recommended, especially the

168
00:16:07,816 --> 00:16:12,358
run by Grant Morrison. And I have to say, in
my research for this episode, I had a whole

169
00:16:12,398 --> 00:16:16,980
lot of fun going back reading the first two
arcs for Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur. Nice.

170
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:21,574
Well, let's get into it. To explain the methodology
behind our duels. Let's go to our sentient

171
00:16:21,634 --> 00:16:27,778
dual simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K, tell
our listeners how you go about determining

172
00:16:27,838 --> 00:16:33,301
a winner in our dual matchups. Yes, of course,
sir. The way I determine a winner between the

173
00:16:33,341 --> 00:16:38,224
contestants is by running 1,000 Monte Carlo
simulations using the characters statistics.

174
00:16:38,704 --> 00:16:43,147
A Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic
model used to determine outcomes through random

175
00:16:43,207 --> 00:16:49,026
sampling. In this case, I randomized the statistics
along a normal distribution. as a way to simulate

176
00:16:49,046 --> 00:16:53,628
the many variables that can occur during battle.
The stat parameters are based on the official

177
00:16:53,688 --> 00:16:59,010
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters'
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat

178
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:04,573
categories are included such as range, damage
potential, versatility and perception in order

179
00:17:04,593 --> 00:17:10,015
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.
The results of the 1000 simulations provide

180
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:14,417
a percentage of wins for each character. The
contestant with the higher percentage is declared

181
00:17:14,437 --> 00:17:19,721
the victor as they have a higher probability
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,

182
00:17:20,102 --> 00:17:24,906
neither character should win 100% of the matches.
The comic book stories have shown that there's

183
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:29,850
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so
the confidence rate of my method falls in line

184
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,473
with the precedents that have been established
in the source material. My mathematical simulations

185
00:17:34,514 --> 00:17:39,678
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes

186
00:17:39,718 --> 00:17:45,959
tabulated for determination of the winner. Thanks,
AG9K! Before we run the simulations though,

187
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:50,702
we like to break down each character's histories
and abilities before improvising a scenario

188
00:17:50,882 --> 00:17:55,926
on how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations
would play out B for B. And I believe it's

189
00:17:56,006 --> 00:18:01,510
my turn to go first with the DC characters backstory,
so let me tell you all about Dorothy Spinner.

190
00:18:01,991 --> 00:18:07,655
Her backstory is a little bit of a downer, but
here it is. Now, Dorothy Spinner was born with

191
00:18:07,695 --> 00:18:13,826
an ape-like facial disfiguration and hairy limbs.
resulting in her birth mother giving her up

192
00:18:13,846 --> 00:18:19,889
for adoption while Dorothy was still an infant.
Adopted by the Spinner family, Dorothy was

193
00:18:19,969 --> 00:18:26,452
raised as an only child on a farm in rural Kansas.
With many in the community repulsed by Dorothy's

194
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:31,954
appearance and due to excessive bullying from
other children, the Spinners isolated Dorothy

195
00:18:32,054 --> 00:18:38,276
on their farm, which occupied much of the Spinner's
time. As a result of her loneliness and isolation,

196
00:18:38,677 --> 00:18:44,163
Dorothy developed imaginary friends, which she
was unknowingly able to bring to life due to

197
00:18:44,203 --> 00:18:49,926
her psychic mind. Her friends taught her to
read and write and told her stories, such as

198
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:56,030
The Wizard of Oz, which Dorothy enjoyed. One
day, while picking flowers outside, Dorothy

199
00:18:56,050 --> 00:19:02,133
was accosted by a young boy named Bernard Muller
and his two friends, who all teased and attacked

200
00:19:02,173 --> 00:19:07,797
her. When Dorothy made her way back to her barn
to find that Bernard had hung her cat, she

201
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:12,848
wished that Bernard was dead. It was at this
point that the Candlemaker emerged from her

202
00:19:12,908 --> 00:19:19,452
mind, a being capable of granting wishes. After
making the wish to the Candlemaker, Bernard

203
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:24,776
was found in a field the next morning by his
friends, crucified and disemboweled. At the

204
00:19:24,816 --> 00:19:30,019
funeral, Dorothy vowed to never make another
wish from the Candlemaker again and buried

205
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:35,863
him deep in her mind. At age 11, Dorothy began
being frightened by the stories that her imaginary

206
00:19:35,903 --> 00:19:42,560
friends were telling her. from the Brothers
Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen. When three

207
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:48,425
imaginary family members tried to get Dorothy
to wear red shoes, they reminded Dorothy of

208
00:19:48,445 --> 00:19:53,189
a fairy tale about a girl who couldn't stop
dancing until her legs were chopped off. Dorothy

209
00:19:53,229 --> 00:19:57,693
told them that she had something to show them
behind the barn, at which point Dorothy shot

210
00:19:57,733 --> 00:20:03,778
and killed them with an imaginary gun. A few
years later, a battle between a team of superhero

211
00:20:03,878 --> 00:20:09,790
outcasts known as the Doom Patrol and the Lord
of Chaos named Pythia. spilled onto the Spinner

212
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:15,694
farm. Home alone, Dorothy got swept up into
the battle and helped the superhero team defeat

213
00:20:15,734 --> 00:20:21,557
Pytheia when the others seemingly died in the
pandemonium. Dorothy was made an honorary member

214
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:26,740
of the Doom Patrol and was shocked when they
called her their friend. After realizing that

215
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:32,503
their daughter had psychic powers, the Spinners
called Dr. Niles Calder, aka the Chief, who

216
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:37,874
you can learn more about in our Chief vs. Professor
X dual episode. The Chief agreed to help care

217
00:20:37,894 --> 00:20:43,177
for Dorothy and brought her to the Doom Patrol's
new headquarters, the Secret Sanctuary in Happy

218
00:20:43,197 --> 00:20:48,440
Harbor, Rhode Island, a former base of the Justice
League, which contained a vault of souvenirs

219
00:20:48,761 --> 00:20:55,324
from past Justice League battles. One of those
souvenirs was the Materiopticon, formerly wielded

220
00:20:55,384 --> 00:21:00,487
by the villain Dr. Destiny and Dream of the
Endless before him, the latter of whom you

221
00:21:00,507 --> 00:21:07,352
can learn more about in our Sandman Due to the
Materiopticon's ability to turn dreams into

222
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:14,076
reality, Dorothy's imaginary family Damal, Darling
Come Home, and Flying Robert came back to life

223
00:21:14,116 --> 00:21:19,840
and attacked Dorothy for killing them, still
trying to get her to wear the red shoes. Realizing

224
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:25,804
the red shoes symbolized Dorothy's fear of menstruation,
the Doom Patrol's resident health and psychiatric

225
00:21:25,964 --> 00:21:32,048
aide Joshua Clay destroyed the machine powering
the Materiopticon, which robbed the imaginary

226
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:37,331
beings of much of their strength. Before they
vanished, Dorothy accepted the red shoes and

227
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:42,834
her own womanhood, realizing the shoes were
ruby slippers after all, and that she was at

228
00:21:42,894 --> 00:21:48,557
home with the Doom Patrol. When the team relocated
their headquarters onto Danny the Street, who

229
00:21:48,597 --> 00:21:54,221
you can learn more about in our Danny the Street
vs. Kerkoa episode, Dorothy and new Doom Patrol

230
00:21:54,261 --> 00:22:00,524
member Flexmantello were kidnapped by an organization
known as the Men from Nowhere, who imprisoned

231
00:22:00,564 --> 00:22:05,723
them in the sub-sub basement of the Pentagon.
known as the Ant Farm, in order to harness

232
00:22:05,763 --> 00:22:11,606
their psychic power to summon an all-powerful
entity known as the Telephone Avatar. Although

233
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:16,309
Flex Mantello managed to weaken the Telephone
Avatar by flexing a muscle that turned the

234
00:22:16,349 --> 00:22:21,413
Pentagon into a circle, Flex and Dorothy would
have been killed were it not for Dorothy wishing

235
00:22:21,453 --> 00:22:27,156
for the Candlemaker to save her and her friends
before passing out. When she awoke, she saw

236
00:22:27,196 --> 00:22:32,090
the Telephone Avatar hanging from the ceiling.
With the Candlemaker constantly intruding into

237
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:37,972
Dorothy's thoughts afterward, asking her for
wishes, Dorothy confessed to Joshua what the

238
00:22:38,012 --> 00:22:43,053
Candlemaker had done before she collapsed from
mental exhaustion. When Joshua went to the

239
00:22:43,113 --> 00:22:49,015
Chief for help, the Chief shot and killed Joshua
for interrupting him. When Dorothy came to

240
00:22:49,095 --> 00:22:54,797
and found Joshua dead, the Candlemaker emerged
and asked Dorothy if she wished that Joshua

241
00:22:54,877 --> 00:23:00,964
were alive. When she said that she did, The
Candlemaker resurrected Joshua, only to kill

242
00:23:00,984 --> 00:23:06,367
him immediately afterward, to Dorothy's horror.
Having gained enough power from Dorothy's wishes

243
00:23:06,488 --> 00:23:12,692
to emerge into the world fully formed, the Candlemaker
decapitated the Chief and destroyed Robotman's

244
00:23:12,732 --> 00:23:18,196
human brain before attacking the world's soul
in New York City, causing people to go insane.

245
00:23:18,656 --> 00:23:24,000
After learning that the Candlemaker was really
an ancient malevolent entity that used Dorothy's

246
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:32,574
The Doom Patrol eventually defeated Candlemaker,
with Dorothy delivering the killing blow by

247
00:23:32,634 --> 00:23:38,479
blowing out the Candlemaker's final flame. The
Doom Patrol disbanded afterward, forcing Dorothy

248
00:23:38,499 --> 00:23:44,063
to enter the real world and get an apartment.
Having to deal with continual harassment from

249
00:23:44,224 --> 00:23:49,848
onlookers whenever she had to leave the house,
Dorothy was also bombarded by African spirits

250
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:52,190
who kept asking her to join their world.

251
00:23:56,718 --> 00:24:01,159
though she was encouraged by the scientist William
Magnus, who you can learn more about in our

252
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:07,320
Metal Men vs. Colossus duel episode, to overcome
her fear of the real world. After being attacked

253
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,422
by spirit-possessed mannequins at a shopping
mall, Dorothy was saved by Robotman, who you

254
00:24:12,442 --> 00:24:17,503
can learn more about in our Robotman vs. Think
episode. The two of them helped reform the

255
00:24:17,523 --> 00:24:23,165
Doom Patrol, though Dorothy found herself depressed
due to her inexperience and frequent inability

256
00:24:23,205 --> 00:24:29,323
to contribute to the team as much as she wanted.
After befriending a magical doll named Charlie,

257
00:24:29,703 --> 00:24:35,365
who she later learned was possessed by the spirit
of a rabbi, Dorothy helped Charlie reform the

258
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:40,947
Holy Grail with the power of her imagination,
and Charlie's spirit departed, his mission

259
00:24:40,987 --> 00:24:46,550
completed. Alone again, Dorothy was taken on
a camping trip by robot man and fellow Doom

260
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:52,172
Patrol member named Coagula to let her know
that her adoptive father had died in a wheat

261
00:24:52,192 --> 00:24:58,326
thrusher accident, and that they found her biological
mother. who was going to meet them soon. Upon

262
00:24:58,387 --> 00:25:03,529
realizing that she was being asked to leave
the Doom Patrol in order to live a normal life

263
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:10,231
with her mom, Dorothy unleashed a psychic explosion
in a fit of immense rejection that killed Quagula,

264
00:25:10,511 --> 00:25:17,594
destroyed Robotman, and put herself into a coma.
After a new Doom Patrol team formed, its version

265
00:25:17,654 --> 00:25:23,817
of Robotman eventually realized that he was
an imaginary version created by Dorothy in

266
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:31,301
her vegetative state. When the real, newly assembled
Robotman realized what was going on, he visited

267
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:36,804
Dorothy in the hospital and made the traumatic
decision to take her off of life support, and

268
00:25:36,844 --> 00:25:43,527
Dorothy soon died. And she remains dead in post-Flashpoint
continuity, though Robotman keeps a photo of

269
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:49,951
the two of them and visits her grave every week.
Powers-wise, Dorothy is a powerful yet somewhat

270
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:56,458
unstable psychic, capable of bringing her imaginary
friends to life. sometimes unwillingly. As

271
00:25:56,498 --> 00:26:02,000
a young girl, many of her imaginary friends
manifest as symbols of her emotions, often

272
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:08,842
fear, or as character interpretations from stories
she's read or heard, and occasionally as recreations

273
00:26:08,882 --> 00:26:15,163
of people she knows. This includes but is not
limited to Pretty Miss Dot, who has lipsticks

274
00:26:15,203 --> 00:26:20,965
for fingers that can shoot fire, Paddle the
Sky, a swirling mass of hands holding paddles,

275
00:26:21,465 --> 00:26:28,229
Heart of Ice, A woman made of ice that can freeze
things Dark is the morning A shadow creature

276
00:26:28,249 --> 00:26:34,913
with a giant fanged mouth Cowboy doll book face
A gun-wielding cowboy made of dolls with a

277
00:26:35,013 --> 00:26:42,398
book for a face And Spinner, a superhero adult
version of Dorothy who's a member of the imagined

278
00:26:42,478 --> 00:26:48,818
team the Doom Force and can manifest the nightmares
of her opponents. That's Dorothy Spinner. That

279
00:26:48,918 --> 00:26:53,139
was a lot darker than I thought it was going
to be and very much a downer. It is like the

280
00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:58,802
exact opposite of the Moon Girl Devil Dinosaur
backstory, which is largely pretty fun and

281
00:26:58,842 --> 00:27:04,184
cute. And yeah, not at all what Dorothy Spinner's
story is. Yeah, it's probably like the most

282
00:27:04,284 --> 00:27:09,666
depressing backstory of any DC character I've
ever done a bio for in the span of this podcast.

283
00:27:10,146 --> 00:27:14,988
So let's cheer up everyone with Moon Girl's
backstory. Yeah, I'm glad I'm going second

284
00:27:15,028 --> 00:27:19,807
here. Here's the backstory for Moon Girl and
Devil Dinosaur. In prehistoric times, in an

285
00:27:19,907 --> 00:27:25,172
alternate dimension existed Dinosaur World,
a planet where dinosaurs lived alongside the

286
00:27:25,212 --> 00:27:30,856
Neanderthal tribes of early humans. Within a
region of active volcanoes called the Valley

287
00:27:30,897 --> 00:27:37,142
of Flame, the most aggressive hominid tribe
called the Killer Folk dominated other, less

288
00:27:37,202 --> 00:27:42,726
hostile tribes such as the Small Folk. When
a group of Killer Folk came across a female

289
00:27:42,766 --> 00:27:47,870
Tyrannosaurus rex-like dinosaur and her young,
they attacked and killed the mother and two

290
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,853
of her children. They offered the third young
dinosaur as a sacrifice to their volcano god

291
00:27:53,154 --> 00:27:58,998
by burning it alive with the fire from their
torches. The beast nearly died, but was rescued

292
00:27:59,058 --> 00:28:04,662
by a boy from the Smallfolk tribe who witnessed
the massacre. The Neanderthal child's name

293
00:28:04,742 --> 00:28:09,865
was Moonboy, as he was the only member of his
tribe who was brave enough to go out at night.

294
00:28:10,454 --> 00:28:15,516
He saw that the flames had turned the dinosaur
scales a fiery red, and the boy took care of

295
00:28:15,576 --> 00:28:21,378
it, naming him Devil. Moonboy and Devil Dinosaur
formed a close bond, and together they fought

296
00:28:21,418 --> 00:28:25,900
and defeated the Killer Folk tribe, claiming
the Valley of Flame for the small folk and

297
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:32,443
protecting the lands from other dinosaurs and
monsters. Meanwhile, universes away, an autistic

298
00:28:32,603 --> 00:28:38,525
9-year-old girl named Lunela Lafayette grew
up on the lower east side of Manhattan. Brilliant.

299
00:28:38,902 --> 00:28:44,406
but shy and mocked for her awkwardness, Lunela
acquired the nickname Moon Girl due to her

300
00:28:44,466 --> 00:28:50,150
constant daydreaming about strange gadgets and
inventions. When the inhuman hero Black Bolt

301
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:55,875
released the Terrigan Mists into Earth's atmosphere
during a battle with Thanos, Lunela believed

302
00:28:55,935 --> 00:29:02,000
she could use her intelligence to help contain
the gases. She and others were afraid that

303
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:06,967
Terrigan exposure would transform them and as
the substance was used by the Inhuman race

304
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:12,569
as a catalyst to change them into their superpowered
forms. Inhumans were descendants of a group

305
00:29:12,629 --> 00:29:17,611
of early mankind that were experimented on by
the alien race, the Kree, to serve as their

306
00:29:17,671 --> 00:29:24,074
soldiers. Hundreds, if not thousands of people
on Earth unknowingly had inhuman genetics and

307
00:29:24,114 --> 00:29:29,516
were being altered due to the pterigen clouds
now in the air. You can learn more about pterigenesis,

308
00:29:29,877 --> 00:29:35,488
the Inhumans, and their king Black Bolt in the
in our Shazam vs Black Bolt dual episode. Lunella

309
00:29:35,528 --> 00:29:41,594
believed the solution to the Terranian clouds
lay in alien Kree science, so she built a device

310
00:29:41,854 --> 00:29:47,339
to help her locate any Kree technology on Earth
in order to study it. This led her underneath

311
00:29:47,379 --> 00:29:53,145
the Brooklyn Bridge where she found a Kree device
called an Omni-Wave Projector that was capable

312
00:29:53,205 --> 00:30:00,707
of opening portals between time and space. Meanwhile,
universes away, Moon Boy happened upon another

313
00:30:00,807 --> 00:30:05,570
Omni-Wave projector that had landed on Dinosaur
World that was being worshipped by the Killer

314
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:11,254
Folk tribe, who called it their Night Stone.
The Killer Folk caught Moon Boy with the device

315
00:30:11,494 --> 00:30:17,579
and beat him to death, when suddenly both projectors
activated simultaneously, opening a portal

316
00:30:17,619 --> 00:30:23,283
between Earth and Dinosaur World. A group of
Killer Folk entered the portal and began terrorizing

317
00:30:23,323 --> 00:30:28,326
the people of present-day Manhattan, but they
were followed by Devil Dinosaur, who sought

318
00:30:28,366 --> 00:30:34,049
to avenge Moonboy's death. Devil Dinosaur saved
Lunela from the Killer Folk, who had fled their

319
00:30:34,089 --> 00:30:39,912
encounter, and she explained to the semi-intelligent
beast that she needed his help to get the Omni-Wave

320
00:30:39,932 --> 00:30:44,795
Projector from the Neanderthals in order to
save humanity. Before they could act, however,

321
00:30:44,955 --> 00:30:50,618
Devil Dinosaur was captured and imprisoned in
a secret facility. Finding her courage, Lunela

322
00:30:50,658 --> 00:30:58,162
resolved to rescue her friend and equipped a
series of homemade gadgets and a suit, After

323
00:30:58,202 --> 00:31:02,605
hacking into a government database to find the
dinosaur's whereabouts, she snuck away from

324
00:31:02,645 --> 00:31:07,588
home and broke into the secret facility, using
her gadgets to break Devil from his high-tech

325
00:31:07,628 --> 00:31:13,032
cage. Together, the duo tracked the Killer Folk
to a Manhattan rooftop where they defeated

326
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:18,576
the Neanderthal group and recovered the Omni-Wave
Projector. However, immediately after their

327
00:31:18,616 --> 00:31:25,340
victory, the Terran Cloud descended upon Lunella,
causing her to undergo teragenesis and encasing

328
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:31,333
her in a giant egg. Devil Dinosaur carried the
egg containing Lunela to safety at her secret

329
00:31:31,373 --> 00:31:36,597
lab underneath her elementary school. When she
hatched, Lunela could not immediately tell

330
00:31:36,617 --> 00:31:42,142
what the Terrigen had changed about her. However,
later at school, she discovered that she would

331
00:31:42,162 --> 00:31:47,327
involuntarily switch minds with Devil Dinosaur,
who was back at the lab, whenever she experienced

332
00:31:47,347 --> 00:31:52,731
strong emotions such as anger or hunger, and
spontaneously during a full moon. Keeping her

333
00:31:52,771 --> 00:31:57,466
crime fighting a secret from her parents as
much as possible, Lunella was eventually discovered

334
00:31:57,526 --> 00:32:04,049
by scientist Amadeus Cho, who administered a
test developed by Bruce Banner called the Brain

335
00:32:04,149 --> 00:32:09,551
Omnicompetence Examiner. It was determined that
Lunella was probably the most intelligent mind

336
00:32:09,591 --> 00:32:15,434
on Earth, scoring higher than other scientific
minds such as Mr. Fantastic. The villain Dr.

337
00:32:15,474 --> 00:32:20,076
Doom took offense to this news and attacked
Lunella, but with help from the superhuman

338
00:32:20,116 --> 00:32:25,758
community, including Dr. Strange, the X-Men,
and Ironheart, She and Devil Dinosaur were

339
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:32,140
able to defeat the Doombot army. At one point,
the inhuman hero Ms. Marvel recruited Lunella

340
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:37,061
and Devil Dinosaur to help in the war between
the Inhumans and the X-Men, which was caused

341
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:42,323
by the toxic nature of the Terrigan mists to
mutants. Lunella used her knowledge of Kree

342
00:32:42,363 --> 00:32:47,564
technology to help the X-Men scientist Forge
miniaturize a version of a machine he designed

343
00:32:47,944 --> 00:32:53,102
that would compress the Terrigan gases into
a solid state and incinerate it. You can learn

344
00:32:53,162 --> 00:32:59,205
more about Forge in our Mr. Terrific vs. Forge
dual episode. Later, Lunella received a distress

345
00:32:59,225 --> 00:33:04,048
call from space and built a spacecraft so she
and Devil Dinosaur could answer it. During

346
00:33:04,088 --> 00:33:09,752
the adventure, her omni-wave projector malfunctioned
and the pair ended up back in time on Dinosaur

347
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:15,835
World, Devil's home planet. There they found
Moonboy at the time he discovered the omni-wave

348
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:20,658
projector and they were able to prevent him
from being beaten by the Killer Folk. Knowing

349
00:33:20,718 --> 00:33:26,182
that Devil was back home with his true owner,
Lunella decided that leaving Kim with Moonboy

350
00:33:26,222 --> 00:33:31,867
was the right thing to do. She said goodbye,
and though Devil Dinosaur protested, she tearfully

351
00:33:31,907 --> 00:33:36,691
told him she didn't want him anymore, and used
the projector to travel back to Earth alone.

352
00:33:37,231 --> 00:33:42,776
Sad and isolated, Lunella ended up joining the
Thing, Human Torch, and the robot Herbie in

353
00:33:42,816 --> 00:33:47,320
a new version of the Fantastic Four, as Mr.
Fantastic and Invisible Woman were off with

354
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,211
their children recreating the multiverse. You
can learn more about that in our Justice Society

355
00:33:52,272 --> 00:33:57,816
vs. Fantastic Four dual episode. Eventually,
Lunella used Herbie to open a dimensional portal

356
00:33:57,856 --> 00:34:02,700
to bring Devil Dinosaur back to Earth to help
in a fight against the Super Skrull, and the

357
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:08,645
two were reunited. Lunella admitted she was
wrong for leaving Kim, Devil forgave her, and

358
00:34:08,685 --> 00:34:13,489
the two went back to fighting crime on their
own. This included helping Doctor Strange rescue

359
00:34:13,569 --> 00:34:19,662
a boy kidnapped by the villain Nightmare, assisting
Spider-Man against a Goblin foe, and solving

360
00:34:19,822 --> 00:34:25,383
an unsolvable riddle for Thor that was posed
by his brother Loki. The latter adventure revealing

361
00:34:25,443 --> 00:34:30,125
that Devil was worthy of wielding Mjolnir and
it transformed him into the Thunder Lizard.

362
00:34:30,565 --> 00:34:35,126
On a family trip to the country of Wakanda,
Lunela's parents discovered her secret alter

363
00:34:35,226 --> 00:34:40,548
ego as Moon Girl. They banned her from continuing
to fight crime with her dinosaur pet, though

364
00:34:40,568 --> 00:34:46,430
they later compromised as long as Lunela visited
with a therapist once a week. At that time,

365
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:51,914
she formed a support group for fellow newly
powered adolescent inhumans called the Support

366
00:34:51,974 --> 00:34:59,259
Alliance Derby for Sensationally Abled Kids,
or SADSACS for short. And that's her backstory.

367
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:04,623
Powers-wise, Moon Girl has the inhuman power
to temporarily swap her consciousness with

368
00:35:04,703 --> 00:35:09,966
Devil Dinosaur, her crime-fighting partner.
This process is triggered involuntarily, caused

369
00:35:09,986 --> 00:35:14,669
by heightened emotional states and the Fool
Moon. She has an exceptionally high intellect.

370
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:20,154
stated to likely be the smartest person on Earth,
and has built a vast array of homemade gadgets

371
00:35:20,194 --> 00:35:25,838
for her crime fighting activities. This includes,
but is not limited to, spectrum scanning goggles,

372
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:32,464
spring-loaded boxing gloves, rocket-powered
roller skates, a helicopter backpack, a plunger-tipped

373
00:35:32,524 --> 00:35:39,389
taser gun, sneeze-powder grenades, a flashlight
flashbang, and so many other toys in her utility

374
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:44,593
belt. She can invent nearly anything she puts
her gifted mind to, physically through engineering,

375
00:35:44,998 --> 00:35:50,581
or digitally through computer programming. Devil
Dinosaur is a physically and mentally enhanced

376
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:56,506
Tyrannosaurus Rex-like dinosaur via genetic
mutation awakened when he was set aflame as

377
00:35:56,526 --> 00:36:02,230
a youngling. He has increased durability and
strength, able to lift around 25 tons, and

378
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:07,433
his scaly hide is immune to heat and strong
enough to be bulletproof. Devil Dinosaur's

379
00:36:07,453 --> 00:36:13,277
fangs, claws, and his sense of smell are razor
sharp, and he can track nearly anyone by their

380
00:36:13,317 --> 00:36:18,745
scent. He has human level reasoning abilities
and can fully understand moon girl's commands.

381
00:36:19,266 --> 00:36:24,150
That's moon girl in devil dinosaur. Wait, so
when devil dinosaur takes over moon girl's

382
00:36:24,170 --> 00:36:29,414
body, is she just like this snarling creature
who's like always hungry? Yeah, she looks quite

383
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:35,759
feral actually. It's kind of funny when it happens.
Interesting. And her friends are aware of what's

384
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:41,724
going on or they aren't? No, she just gets further
ostracized for being weird when she swaps minds

385
00:36:41,744 --> 00:36:46,623
with devil dinosaur during school time. That's
funny. That's cute. What a cute character.

386
00:36:47,164 --> 00:36:51,987
Yeah. And she freaking lives at the end. Yeah,
that's because Marvel is for little kids, bro.

387
00:36:52,147 --> 00:36:59,792
OK. All right. DC is for the adults. Sad adults,
but adults nonetheless. I mean, what adult

388
00:36:59,852 --> 00:37:00,353
isn't sad?

389
00:37:08,814 --> 00:37:12,374
So now that we got the characters' histories
and abilities out of the way, let's speculate

390
00:37:12,434 --> 00:37:17,356
on how one of the 1000 simulated matches will
go. The winner is determined by simulations,

391
00:37:17,796 --> 00:37:22,057
not the speculation, but it's fun to imagine
how the fight could play out. Alfred Jarvis

392
00:37:22,097 --> 00:37:27,779
9000, what are the rules of our speculation?
Well, I should say there are no rules, other

393
00:37:27,799 --> 00:37:31,840
than the characters have no prior knowledge
of the other going into the fight. All they

394
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:36,401
are aware of starting out is that the other
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.

395
00:37:36,781 --> 00:37:42,120
For the speculation... contestants will begin
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript

396
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,963
environment that will have no bearing on the
match itself as no environmental statistics

397
00:37:46,984 --> 00:37:52,327
are considered in my simulations. The contestants
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright

398
00:37:52,347 --> 00:37:57,210
then let's get into it! Dorothy Spinner and
Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur meet on the battlefield.

399
00:37:57,611 --> 00:38:03,215
Who goes first? Honestly this is kind of hard
because I don't think either character would

400
00:38:03,255 --> 00:38:09,783
attack the other really. Like they'd probably
commiserate and want to be but that's too bad

401
00:38:09,803 --> 00:38:15,046
because the purpose of the podcast is to see
who would win in no holds barred action. So

402
00:38:15,066 --> 00:38:22,010
we're gonna make these children fight, damn
it. All right, I figured that once Dorothy

403
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:29,114
sees Devil Dinosaur, she's gonna freak out and
probably summon Pretty Miss Dot, who's kind

404
00:38:29,134 --> 00:38:36,450
of her go-to when she's in danger. So this weird
entity wearing a helmet with lips. and curlers

405
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:42,354
and lipstick fingers flies toward Devil Dinosaur
and begins blasting him with fire. Alright,

406
00:38:42,394 --> 00:38:48,398
well that does nothing. Devil Dinosaur is immune
to fire, so all this attack is gonna do is

407
00:38:48,419 --> 00:38:53,322
just piss him off. So he's infuriated and he's
gonna roar real loud and then he's just gonna

408
00:38:53,382 --> 00:38:59,586
chomp down on Pretty Mistat with his razor sharp
teeth. Meanwhile, Moon Girl is gonna roller

409
00:38:59,606 --> 00:39:04,169
skate over to Dorothy and just knock her the
hell out with a spring-loaded boxing glove.

410
00:39:04,618 --> 00:39:09,679
Yeah, except that now Dorothy is emotionally
traumatized by having seen Pretty Miss Dot

411
00:39:09,739 --> 00:39:15,941
just die like that. So while Moon Girl was approaching
Dorothy, she's going to conjure several more

412
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:22,483
entities. And we'll go with Paddle the Sky for
Moon Girl and Heart of Ice for Devil Dinosaur,

413
00:39:22,563 --> 00:39:27,484
since Fire didn't do anything to him. So not
only does Moon Girl's boxing glove get knocked

414
00:39:27,544 --> 00:39:33,386
out of the way, she also gets paddled numerous
times by Paddle the Sky. And Devil Dinosaur

415
00:39:33,426 --> 00:39:39,547
is now encased in ice. Remind, what do Paddle
of the Sky and Heart of Ice look like? Paddle

416
00:39:39,567 --> 00:39:45,169
of the Sky is literally a spinning vortex of
hands holding wooden paddles. And Heart of

417
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:51,971
Ice is just a woman made of ice. Okay. Uh, not
gonna lie, I don't think Moon Girl would be

418
00:39:52,031 --> 00:39:58,833
well equipped for all this weirdness. But she's
gonna evade the paddles by activating her spring-loaded

419
00:39:58,893 --> 00:40:04,303
roller skates to launch herself into the air.
And then she's going to switch on her helicopter

420
00:40:04,323 --> 00:40:10,085
backpack. So she's flying through the air. And
as this paddle creature is chasing her, Moon

421
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:15,727
Girl's going to pilot over toward Devil Dinosaur.
And then she's going to quickly zip out of

422
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:22,950
the way so that paddle guy crashes into Devil
Dinosaur, who's in the ice. And basically the

423
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:28,813
paddles are going to break Devil Dinosaur out
of his ice casing. Yeah, right. So now that

424
00:40:28,913 --> 00:40:35,127
Devil Dinosaur is free, He's just gonna tackle
paddle the sky out of the sky and just eviscerate

425
00:40:35,147 --> 00:40:41,008
it turning those paddles into Splinters I hope
you choke on them And while that's happening

426
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:47,630
moon girl is gonna whip out a hairdryer That
she outfitted as a flamethrower and she's just

427
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:55,252
gonna melt the ice lady to a puddle Dude keep
killing Dorothy's imaginary friends. See what

428
00:40:55,292 --> 00:41:02,094
happens. She's got some weird ass friends, you
know Even you've got insoles for her. Wow.

429
00:41:02,654 --> 00:41:07,536
She can't catch a break, can she? Dude, these
friends are objectively weird. I don't think

430
00:41:07,616 --> 00:41:14,258
anybody would deny them. Literally one of them
is made out of paddles. Come on. And while

431
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:17,899
Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur are taking care
of them, Dorothy is going to be like, oh, no,

432
00:41:17,959 --> 00:41:24,460
my friends. And that is when Moon Girls, she's
going to pull out a can of soda that she shakes

433
00:41:24,621 --> 00:41:30,242
and then hurls over to Dorothy like a grenade
and the can. is gonna explode and just drench

434
00:41:30,282 --> 00:41:36,264
Dorothy in this sticky adhesive that Moon Girl
invented. Okay, the can, it's gonna explode

435
00:41:36,344 --> 00:41:41,745
way before it reaches Dorothy because Cowboy
Doll Bookface is gonna shoot it right out of

436
00:41:41,785 --> 00:41:46,907
the sky when it's right over Devil Dinosaur,
just drenching him in the adhesive instead.

437
00:41:47,427 --> 00:41:52,488
So Devil is stuck to the ground and Cowboy is
just gonna keep shooting at Moon Girl. All

438
00:41:52,508 --> 00:41:58,910
right, well, Moon Girl is gonna dive behind
Devil Dinosaur. and use him as cover since

439
00:41:59,470 --> 00:42:05,212
she knows that he's bulletproof. And then to
get him free of the adhesive, she's gonna pour

440
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:10,914
a soda can of anti-adhesive on him and then
hop on Devil's back as he gets up and just

441
00:42:10,934 --> 00:42:18,456
straight up charges cowboy doll face and whips
his tail right through him, book face. Whatever.

442
00:42:18,596 --> 00:42:23,897
But his tail whip is gonna cause the cowboy
to explode into a thousand doll parts. So he's

443
00:42:23,937 --> 00:42:28,883
gone. And without missing a beat, like after
that tail whip, Moon Girl is going to spring

444
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:34,446
off of Devil Dinosaur's back and she's going
to shoot a taser plunger at Dorothy that sticks

445
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:39,188
to Dorothy's head and it's going to send like
10,000 volts of electricity through her brain,

446
00:42:39,448 --> 00:42:45,491
just shutting it down. Well, OK, Dorothy's knocked
out, but she doesn't need to be conscious for

447
00:42:45,511 --> 00:42:51,533
her imaginary friends to manifest or protect
her. You know, so as Moon Girl is about to

448
00:42:51,633 --> 00:42:58,514
land. She lands on Honey Pie, which is a beehive
with tree branches for limbs and a honey pot

449
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:04,879
for a head. So Honey Pie has Moon Girl in this
bear hug, essentially, and Moon Girl's being

450
00:43:04,979 --> 00:43:11,584
squeezed and stung as she's pressed up against
this pissed off beehive. And meanwhile, Spinner,

451
00:43:11,844 --> 00:43:17,788
the adult version of Dorothy, is going to appear
and manifest Devil Dinosaur's greatest fear,

452
00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:24,927
which is... I don't know, an army of the killer
folk tribesmen who are all gonna rush and attack

453
00:43:24,967 --> 00:43:30,869
Devil Dinosaur. I mean, Devil Dinosaur eats
killer folk for breakfast, alright? So he's

454
00:43:30,889 --> 00:43:37,350
gonna tear through them to rescue Moon Girl
from this beehive guy. Honey pie. Yeah, yeah,

455
00:43:37,390 --> 00:43:42,672
he's gonna grab honey pie in his T-Rex claws
and just freaking body slam that thing causing

456
00:43:42,712 --> 00:43:48,473
it to drop Moon Girl who's gonna helicopter
away to safety. And as she's flying away...

457
00:43:48,854 --> 00:43:54,378
She's gonna pull out of her backpack a version
of Professor X's Cerebro device that in the

458
00:43:54,398 --> 00:44:00,704
comics she once calibrated to detect magic beings.
So she's gonna be recalibrating it again. Where

459
00:44:00,744 --> 00:44:06,108
is she pulling this stuff out from? Her backpack?
Okay. Well, I mean, Spinner is still around.

460
00:44:06,288 --> 00:44:12,934
So she's gonna appear into Moon Girl's mind
and manifest Moon Girl's greatest fear, which

461
00:44:12,994 --> 00:44:18,562
is, I don't know, what's Moon Girl's greatest
fear? Uh, I- I don't know, an F on a test or

462
00:44:18,582 --> 00:44:27,708
something? Big whoop. Uh, Moon Girl wearing
the recalibrated cerebro is gonna deduce that

463
00:44:27,828 --> 00:44:34,552
Dorothy's friends are psychic manifestations.
So she's gonna pull out a bullhorn that emanates

464
00:44:34,632 --> 00:44:41,636
a frequency that disrupts psychic energies and
Moon Girl's gonna use this invention to just

465
00:44:41,756 --> 00:44:49,141
dissipate Spinner. Okay, all right, so. Dorothy
is going to wake up to see Spinner dissipate,

466
00:44:49,821 --> 00:44:55,446
and all of a sudden she hears the Candlemaker
whispering in her mind, asking her to make

467
00:44:55,466 --> 00:45:00,610
a wish. And she's going to wish that this match
was over. And that's what's going to happen.

468
00:45:01,050 --> 00:45:08,516
Devil Dinosaur, he'll eat Moon Girl, and he
himself is going to burst into eldritch flames

469
00:45:08,717 --> 00:45:14,181
that just melt his bodily tissue like Raiders
of the Lost Ark style, just leaving this dinosaur

470
00:45:14,221 --> 00:45:19,032
skeleton. match over. What? I don't get it.
Was Devil Dinosaur possessed or something?

471
00:45:19,252 --> 00:45:23,314
I don't I don't even know what happened there.
No, like he was more like driven insane by

472
00:45:23,354 --> 00:45:29,798
the Candlemaker. And it caused him to eat Moon
Girl. Yep. I say that like even before Dorothy

473
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:35,261
hears the Candlemaker like whispering in her
ear and then, you know, she makes the wish

474
00:45:35,301 --> 00:45:40,684
and all that weirdness happens. That would take
a while. So before that, Devil Dinosaur just

475
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:47,114
straight up stomps Dorothy with his big old
dinosaur foot. planning and then he's gonna

476
00:45:47,134 --> 00:45:52,556
let out a big victory roar like the T-Rex did
at the end of the Jurassic Park movie. I don't

477
00:45:52,656 --> 00:45:59,678
think that hearing make a wish and then making
a wish would take all that long. I mean it's

478
00:45:59,718 --> 00:46:03,999
not quicker than a foot dropping on you so I
don't know. But we could go ahead and leave

479
00:46:04,039 --> 00:46:09,341
the match there either Dorothy makes her wish
and the candle maker causes moon girl and devil

480
00:46:09,361 --> 00:46:14,919
dinosaur to destroy themselves or Dorothy doesn't
have a chance to make the wish because she's

481
00:46:14,959 --> 00:46:19,022
a pancake. Let's go ahead and find out which
of these scenarios happens by inputting the

482
00:46:19,042 --> 00:46:23,445
stats for these characters and running 1000
simulations. We'll be right back with the winner.

483
00:46:23,966 --> 00:46:32,232
8G9K, hit it! Inputting data, running calculations,
processing results, simulations complete. I

484
00:46:32,272 --> 00:46:35,734
hate to see these two characters go up against
each other. It would have been more fun, I

485
00:46:35,754 --> 00:46:40,057
think, to do a speculation where they become
best friends and hang out together, you know,

486
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:44,315
right? It was kind of interesting just coming
up with the stats. We kind of realized that

487
00:46:44,415 --> 00:46:49,138
both of these characters' powers are essentially
the power of imagination. Like they're highly,

488
00:46:49,178 --> 00:46:54,881
highly versatile. Right, because Moon Girl can
basically engineer anything she imagines, and

489
00:46:55,241 --> 00:47:00,464
Dorothy Spinner can manifest it. So that was
pretty cool. We treated this matchup like a

490
00:47:00,564 --> 00:47:05,147
two versus two character matchup, like a mini
team duel, which we've done before in episodes

491
00:47:05,187 --> 00:47:10,509
like Cloak and Dagger versus the Wonder Twins,
or North Star and Aurora versus Hawk and Dove.

492
00:47:10,922 --> 00:47:14,623
Yeah, or like Daughters of the Demon versus
Daughters of the Dragon. Yeah, we've done a

493
00:47:14,663 --> 00:47:21,385
few 2v2 matches before. In this case, we counted
the individual stats for Moon Girl and Devil

494
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:29,307
Dinosaur, as well as Dorothy Spinner on her
own, and kind of an amalgamation of her imaginary

495
00:47:29,367 --> 00:47:35,349
friends, wherein we averaged the stats of all
of her imaginary friends, and treated it as

496
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:40,186
kind of like this composite being. Yeah, which
was not easy. No, it was pretty difficult to

497
00:47:40,226 --> 00:47:44,287
come up with that average for the imaginary
friends, but in the end we ended up getting

498
00:47:44,547 --> 00:47:50,189
win rates for each one of the characters. Dorothy
Spinner was by far the weakest. Yes, Dorothy

499
00:47:50,209 --> 00:47:55,910
Spinner is hands down the weakest character
I've ever done a duel with. I felt bad for

500
00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:02,092
her as I was entering these stats in. But, her
imaginary friend creatures were actually really

501
00:48:02,132 --> 00:48:07,082
powerful, more powerful than either Moon Girl
or Devil Dinosaur on their own. And- kind of

502
00:48:07,102 --> 00:48:11,703
wiped the floor with both of them individually,
winning three quarters of all of its matches.

503
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:16,404
And what was really interesting was that Moon
Girl actually had better stats than Devil Dinosaur.

504
00:48:16,584 --> 00:48:21,566
Right. Just due to her heightened intelligence
and versatility with all the inventions and

505
00:48:21,606 --> 00:48:26,947
stuff like that. Devil Dinosaur is strong and
can do damage, but otherwise, you know, he's

506
00:48:27,007 --> 00:48:32,449
not that impressive statistically, considering
he's kind of a one trick pony and not that

507
00:48:32,469 --> 00:48:38,435
bright. He's a dinosaur. It's kind of interesting
because a lot of Dorothy's imaginary friends

508
00:48:38,455 --> 00:48:43,437
were also one trick ponies. But then you have
someone like the candle maker, who isn't technically

509
00:48:43,477 --> 00:48:48,059
an imaginary friend, but we still kind of counted
him in the composite considering the fact that

510
00:48:48,139 --> 00:48:53,681
he was a manifestation from Dorothy's mind.
And the guy could almost do anything. You can

511
00:48:53,701 --> 00:48:59,224
make wishes come true, essentially. Yeah, he
definitely skewed that average. But was it

512
00:48:59,264 --> 00:49:04,899
enough? What do you think, Joseph? I think there's
an interesting balance here. between how weak

513
00:49:04,939 --> 00:49:10,324
Dorothy is, but how strong her imaginary friends
are. And then Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur

514
00:49:10,584 --> 00:49:15,489
are somewhere in between that power spectrum.
So I think the matchup is gonna be close. I

515
00:49:15,569 --> 00:49:19,973
do think that the scales are ultimately gonna
tip toward Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur though.

516
00:49:20,413 --> 00:49:26,559
So we did a poll on Instagram and 64% of those
who voted, voted in favor of Moon Girl and

517
00:49:26,599 --> 00:49:31,562
Devil Dinosaur. Do you think it's gonna be over
or under that? I think it's going to be under

518
00:49:31,582 --> 00:49:35,343
that. I think it's going to be a closer match.
But that was definitely a popularity contest

519
00:49:35,383 --> 00:49:39,444
poll. We even had some people ask us like, who
the heck is Dorothy Spinner? To which case

520
00:49:39,464 --> 00:49:44,646
it got to say read and or watch Doom Patrol
because it's awesome. You have to watch Doom

521
00:49:44,666 --> 00:49:50,587
Patrol on Max. It's a great show. And its final
season is wrapping up here soon. But let's

522
00:49:50,607 --> 00:49:57,289
find out who won. AJ 9K, the results, please.
Hey, you are, sir. The winner of the matchup

523
00:49:57,569 --> 00:50:04,938
between Dorothy Spinner. and Moon Girl and Devil
Dinosaur is Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur. Hell

524
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:09,861
yeah. I was hoping she'd win that coming. I
was hoping she'd win this one. It was close.

525
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:18,888
Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur won 57.1% of the
matches or 571 out of 1000 compared to Dorothy

526
00:50:18,948 --> 00:50:25,212
Spinner and her imaginary friend who only won
42.9. So that was pretty close. If you had

527
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:29,658
asked me leading into this. Whether or not I
thought Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur even stood

528
00:50:29,678 --> 00:50:36,080
a chance against Dorothy Spinner, I would have
said you're out of your mind. Well, it's really

529
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:42,262
all about Moon Girl's intelligence, right? Considering
that she is likely the most intelligent person

530
00:50:42,342 --> 00:50:46,603
in the Marvel universe, she has a lot going
for her. Probably more than you ever realized.

531
00:50:46,703 --> 00:50:50,724
Way more than Dorothy Spinner, I think. It's
not down to the intelligence. You know what

532
00:50:50,764 --> 00:50:57,166
it's down to? What? The fucking system, man.
The fucking system. What? Yeah, it's like there's

533
00:50:57,266 --> 00:51:02,188
no way that Dorothy Spinner would go into this
match with only one imaginary friend, but it's

534
00:51:02,308 --> 00:51:08,270
way too complicated to pit two characters up
against like 20. Well, that's why we had the

535
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:12,892
composite imaginary friend. It's not good enough.
It's not good enough. The system's broken.

536
00:51:13,532 --> 00:51:18,394
I think it sounds pretty accurate myself. But,
you know, any time Marvel wins. It always sounds

537
00:51:18,434 --> 00:51:22,776
highly accurate to me. It does make me wonder
though, how we're gonna run the stats for next

538
00:51:22,816 --> 00:51:28,379
week's team duel between Doom Patrol and Guardians
of the Galaxy if we count Dorothy Spinner as

539
00:51:28,439 --> 00:51:34,162
multiple beings. I don't know if we can actually.
We might have to do a composite of her as well

540
00:51:34,222 --> 00:51:37,804
with the imaginary friend. That'll be interesting.
That will be interesting. We'll have to figure

541
00:51:37,824 --> 00:51:44,128
that out. Considering those seven versus seven,
matrices simulations take a long time to run.

542
00:51:44,708 --> 00:51:50,479
Yeah, ton of time. Even two versus two takes
a while. Yeah. I hope you feel bad. I hope

543
00:51:50,499 --> 00:51:55,462
you feel bad for Dorothy Spinner. She's had
a hard life and you don't make it any easier.

544
00:51:56,702 --> 00:52:01,905
Well, geez, I do feel bad for her as a character,
but also, you know, Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur

545
00:52:01,945 --> 00:52:07,648
deserve this win. So there you go. All right.
I guess if you can live with that guilt that

546
00:52:07,688 --> 00:52:11,330

going to be episode 350, a big team duel between

556
00:53:00,546 --> 00:53:06,547
the Doom Patrol and the Guardians of the Galaxy.
Can I wait for that? Doom Patrol is going down

557
00:53:06,607 --> 00:53:12,629
and it is gonna be very satisfying. I just imagine
it's going to be like the most bizarre team

558
00:53:12,669 --> 00:53:17,319
duel that we've ever had. I guarantee it. For
sure, for sure. But that does it for this episode,

559
00:53:17,339 --> 00:53:21,963
we want to give a big thanks to our executive
producers Ken Johnson, John Strausky, Zachary

560
00:53:21,983 --> 00:53:26,827
Hepburn, Dustin Balcombe, Mickey Mathen-Geehan,
Brandon Estregard, Nathaniel Wagner, Levi Yeaton,

561
00:53:26,987 --> 00:53:33,152
Nick Abonto, Austin Wyslowski, AJ Dunkerley,
Scott Camacho, and Adam Spies for helping make

562
00:53:33,172 --> 00:53:38,616
this podcast possible. And we'll talk to you
guys next week. Up up and away, true believers.
