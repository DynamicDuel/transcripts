1
00:00:03,284 --> 00:00:03,345
you

2
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:29,493
a weekly show where we review superhero films
and debate the superiority between Marvel and

3
00:00:29,533 --> 00:00:34,856
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based
Battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe and I'm

4
00:00:34,876 --> 00:00:39,879
his twin brother Johnny DC And this is our 91st
episode and part of the official countdown

5
00:00:39,919 --> 00:00:45,603
to our 100th episode Which we have a special
treat planned for you guys, but no hints just

6
00:00:45,643 --> 00:00:51,146
yet in this episode We'll be talking about who
would win in a fight between Clayface Venom.

7
00:00:51,286 --> 00:00:55,570
Yeah, it's in preparation for our Venom review,
which comes out this Friday. That came up like

8
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,793
really quick Yeah, I kind of snuck up faster
than I thought it would for some reason I was

9
00:00:58,833 --> 00:01:03,116
thinking like mid-october, but no it's this
Friday that it's coming out So it's weird because

10
00:01:03,136 --> 00:01:08,100
we've been talking about this movie forever
and yet it still snuck up on me, right? Right.

11
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,905
So yeah, look forward to that Venom movie review
next week, but in this episode again It's a

12
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:17,689
dual episode and we'll get all up into that
later on after we go over the comic book movie

13
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,868
news over the past week So we'll be talking
about the Dark Phoenix trailer and some of

14
00:01:21,888 --> 00:01:26,972
the other fox fuckery that's going on with release
dates and stuff like that. There was some casting

15
00:01:27,012 --> 00:01:31,316
for the Birds of Prey film. We got Huntress
and Black Canary cast. We got a new trailer

16
00:01:31,336 --> 00:01:35,860
for the Titans show that's on DC Universe in
the US, but apparently it's also moving to

17
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,044
Netflix internationally. And finally, there
was a new trailer for the Runaway season two

18
00:01:41,064 --> 00:01:46,069
that's coming to Hulu. And we'll just talk briefly
about that. Yeah, and just quick heads up,

19
00:01:46,309 --> 00:01:51,456
we are... off our Patreon hiatus. Yeah, we're
back with the bonus content coming out every

content from us, definitely do that. We've

22
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:06,405
been talking for a while now about how the reason
we went on hiatus for Patreon during the month

23
00:02:06,425 --> 00:02:10,867
of September was because we were working on
kind of like a secret project as it were. And

24
00:02:10,887 --> 00:02:16,734
also because we wanted to reevaluate sort of
what content we did. for Patreon and how we

25
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:20,576
released that content. We're still trying to
figure that out, but in the meantime, we do

26
00:02:20,597 --> 00:02:25,279
have bonus content for you guys. Yeah, basically
our current patrons will get an exclusive first

a listener every week. So again, visit patreon.com

30
00:02:40,988 --> 00:02:45,554
slash dynamic duel and help us reach that goal.
And speaking of no prizes, It's No Prize time.

31
00:02:47,476 --> 00:02:51,419
So No Prize is an award that Marvel used to
give out up until the 90s to fans. Our version,

32
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,284
the Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award
that we post on social media that I personally

33
00:02:56,324 --> 00:03:00,627
draw for those who we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week's question

34
00:03:00,667 --> 00:03:05,171
was, what MCU character do you most want to
see get their own limited series on Disney

35
00:03:05,191 --> 00:03:09,015
Play and what particular storyline do you hope
to see with them? And this is coming up the

36
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:14,791
news from last week that the Disney Play streaming
app will feature original limited series starring

37
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:20,134
the characters and actors from the MCU films,
which was exciting news. So we got a lot of

38
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:24,336
great answers on this one. It was so damn hard
to pick a winner from the selection of answers,

39
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:29,079
but, you know, gun to my head, I had to choose,
so that's what we did. But first up, honorable

40
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:33,982
mention to Karen Diekmann, who gave the answer
of Rocket Raccoon. It's the perfect answer.

41
00:03:34,242 --> 00:03:38,824
I would love to see a limited series just based
off Rocket Raccoon going off of his history

42
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:43,712
as an experiment. You know? Andy Freeman gets
honorable mention as well for answering Gambit.

43
00:03:43,992 --> 00:03:48,156
I'm not sure if the X-Men characters are going
to be a part of the MCU by the time this rolls

44
00:03:48,256 --> 00:03:54,321
out. Well, I mean, I think it's a great way
to introduce these characters prior to introducing

45
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:58,765
them in the films. Like, establish their backstory
right away in their own individual limited

46
00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:03,308
series, and then show them on the films as a
team unit. And honestly, I know we're going

47
00:04:03,328 --> 00:04:07,852
to be talking about the Gambit movie later on
in this episode, but at this point, the movie's

48
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:12,668
been pushed back so far. already that you may
as well just forget about the movie and throw

49
00:04:12,688 --> 00:04:17,192
it on the small screen. In an ideal world that
would happen. Yeah. Also honorable mention

50
00:04:17,212 --> 00:04:22,557
to Mitchell Phipps, who gave the answer Quicksilver,
which yeah, absolutely. We did not get enough

51
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:27,001
Quicksilver in Avengers Age of Ultron. Right.
It would be great to find out more about the

52
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:30,784
character. I'm still hoping they resurrect him
in the next Avengers film. Right. But if they

53
00:04:30,844 --> 00:04:35,039
don't, what's great about this is- you could
still bring those characters back to do these

54
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:39,402
shows. Yeah, it's possible that you may have
that version of Quicksilver in the announced

55
00:04:39,623 --> 00:04:43,585
Scarlet Witch limited series that they're gonna
do on Disney Play. Yeah, maybe. But yeah, I'd

56
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:47,728
like to see Quicksilver also get his own show.
That'd be cool. Also honorable mention to Jace

57
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:52,452
Crump, who gave the answer Winter Soldier. Oh
god, that would be so fantastic. To like follow

58
00:04:52,472 --> 00:04:56,715
him through the years, since the 1940s when
he became the Winter Soldier. Yeah, it'd be

59
00:04:56,735 --> 00:05:01,906
like a spy show. Yeah, so fantastic. That would
be a great, great time. Also honorable mention

60
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:06,128
to Jacob Bell who gave the answer the Hulk and
he specifically was looking for the planet

61
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:12,691
Hulk storyline It's probably like his like lost
days while he was on Sakaar. Right? Yeah prior

62
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:16,712
to Thor arriving on that planet I think that
would make for some pretty interesting viewing

63
00:05:16,752 --> 00:05:21,234
as well She's gonna see like Hulk's rise through
the gladiator ranks Yeah, and you know becoming

64
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:25,896
a favorite of the Grandmaster and stuff like
that. Yeah, that would be so cool Also honorable

65
00:05:25,936 --> 00:05:30,122
mention to Dan Baker who gave the answer of
M'Baku who's the leader of the White Gorilla

66
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:34,824
Clan in the Black Panther movie. I can't see
how you could not do a series with him and

67
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:40,066
see the White Gorilla Clan evolve through the
ages until M'Baku became the king and see just

68
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:45,508
what, kind of like the day-to-day life is there.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And our final honorable mention

69
00:05:45,548 --> 00:05:52,071
goes to Ariana Quadra, who actually gave my
favorite answer in Adam Warlock, because who

70
00:05:52,111 --> 00:05:56,253
knows if we're gonna get Guardians of the Galaxy
3? And this may be a fantastic opportunity

71
00:05:56,613 --> 00:06:02,965
to see, like, that dangling thread that may
never get picked up of Adam Warlock. I'm still

72
00:06:02,985 --> 00:06:06,387
convinced that we are going to get Guardians
of the Galaxy 3 because it's the studio has

73
00:06:06,427 --> 00:06:11,031
stated that they're working off of James Gunn's
script. They just need to find a director and

74
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:14,393
I don't think there's a timetable for that.
I have a feeling we're going to see Adam Warlock

75
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:18,616
in the third Guardians of the Galaxy movie.
So that's why I didn't pick it for my favorite

76
00:06:18,656 --> 00:06:22,759
answer. That being said, if there's never a
Guardians of the Galaxy 3 movie ever made,

77
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:27,202
then yeah, I would love to see an Adam Warlock
movie and see exactly where. You know that

78
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:32,065
storyline picks up after the after credits scene
in Guardians 2. The winner of the no prize

79
00:06:32,085 --> 00:06:37,187
for this week though goes to Adrian Maines who
gave the answer of Thanos. He wants to see

80
00:06:37,328 --> 00:06:41,870
a Thanos limited series involving the character
taking place prior to the events of Infinity

81
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:46,653
War and in his early history. Which I think
would be fantastic. Like I'd love to see like

82
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:52,596
Thanos's early days on Titan and the death of
the planets and just sort of his rise to power.

83
00:06:52,676 --> 00:06:56,966
Yeah, life as a space pirate and things like
that. That would just be utterly fantastic.

84
00:06:57,066 --> 00:07:01,087
He is definitely one of the more like intriguing
villains to come out in a superhero film. And

85
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:05,848
yeah, he's in he's intriguing in terms of, you
know, his character and his philosophy and

86
00:07:05,868 --> 00:07:09,389
things like that. We got to know him pretty
well in that Infinity War movie, but we didn't

87
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:15,351
learn much more about his history. So let's
see that. Yeah. Congrats to Adrian once again.

88
00:07:15,851 --> 00:07:21,233
And if you, the listener, are interested in
winning a dynamic duel, no prize. Keep listening

89
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:25,267
to the rest of the episode where we'll give
this week's question of the week. With that

90
00:07:25,328 --> 00:07:26,556
out of the way, onto the news.

91
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:38,211
Alright, so the first trailer for the Dark Phoenix
film dropped this past week. And, you know,

92
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:42,715
it wasn't quite the shit show that I thought
it was going to be, but it's still not necessarily

93
00:07:42,815 --> 00:07:46,699
what I'm looking for from the X-Men franchise.
It doesn't look poorly directed. Like, the

94
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:52,144
cinematography looks good. Oh yeah, Simon Kimberg
actually, he did better than I thought he was

95
00:07:52,164 --> 00:07:57,349
going to do with a lot of these shots. Yeah.
The cinematography at times almost looks artful.

96
00:07:57,742 --> 00:08:01,224
throughout the course of this trailer, and that
might be the most surprising thing. Yeah, there's

97
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:05,767
not a lot of special effects in this trailer,
but it still looks pretty cool. Yeah. That

98
00:08:05,787 --> 00:08:12,432
being said, I don't know if it looks good. That's
true. The trailer starts off, we see young

99
00:08:12,472 --> 00:08:17,275
Jean Grey as she's meeting Professor X, and
we see the accident that results in her ending

100
00:08:17,315 --> 00:08:21,798
up an orphan and going to stay at the mansion.
Now that deviates slightly from the comics,

101
00:08:21,838 --> 00:08:26,930
as we know, if you listen to our Phoenix versus
Raven episode and the comics, Jean Grey, was

102
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,674
present as her best friend died and was hit
by a car and telepathically experienced her

103
00:08:31,694 --> 00:08:37,598
friend's emotions as she died. In this case,
they kind of made young Jean Grey to be a little

104
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:41,361
bit more of a sinister character than what I'm
used to seeing. Yeah, she's definitely dark.

105
00:08:41,401 --> 00:08:46,385
They definitely put the dark in Dark Phoenix
in this film. Yeah, like, I guess the question

106
00:08:46,426 --> 00:08:51,590
I have regarding the character of Jean Grey
in this film is, is she actually evil? Because

107
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,952
that's not, that was never the case in the comics.
In the comics, we know that she was trapped

108
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:59,868
underwater and about to die. but a cosmic entity
known as the Phoenix Force came down, saved

109
00:08:59,908 --> 00:09:04,031
her, like wrapped her in a cocoon of energy,
and then took on her form and pretended to

110
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:09,715
be her, and was easily corrupted and super powerful.
And it wasn't really Jean Grey. It was just

111
00:09:09,735 --> 00:09:14,379
a manifestation of Jean Grey by the cosmic entity
known as the Phoenix Force. Right, right, right.

112
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,203
The initial idea that Claremont had when writing
the Dark Phoenix storyline was that the Phoenix

113
00:09:20,503 --> 00:09:26,043
was actually Jean Grey reaching her utmost.
potential of her mutant powers and it corrupted

114
00:09:26,063 --> 00:09:30,746
her. And then only later on when they wanted
to bring her back in the comics was it retconned

115
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:34,928
that it wasn't her at all. That it wasn't her
at all. It was just this manifestation. And

116
00:09:35,008 --> 00:09:40,612
so that original concept that Claremont had
for the Dark Phoenix was explored in the X-Men

117
00:09:40,632 --> 00:09:45,875
The Last Stand film. Yeah. Where Jean Grey reached
her like her peak power and it corrupted her.

118
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:51,366
Exactly. So we've seen that side explored. We've
seen the story before. Yes. I was hoping that

119
00:09:51,406 --> 00:09:55,929
in this version of the Dark Phoenix story, it
would take on the more true-to-the-comics approach.

120
00:09:56,229 --> 00:10:01,013
And that may be the case because we do get some
shots in the trailer of them like in outer

121
00:10:01,053 --> 00:10:04,115
space. That's not going to be the case because
we have already seen her become the Phoenix

122
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:09,178
in the last Apocalypse movie. That's true. So
it's going to be her. It's not going to be

123
00:10:09,218 --> 00:10:14,522
this cosmic force. She might be empowered through
these cosmic rays or something like that in

124
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:19,025
space. I'm not sure exactly what's going on
in that last shot, which actually looks amazing.

125
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:23,669
All this. fire or radiation or something. Oh
yeah, that's the coolest shot in the film for

126
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:28,273
sure. Like being absorbed into her? Yeah. Yeah,
I don't know what's going on there. I mean,

127
00:10:28,313 --> 00:10:32,256
it couldn't be the Phoenix Force going into
her, right? Because we've already seen that.

128
00:10:32,276 --> 00:10:35,599
They would have a lot of explaining to do in
the apocalypse. Right, because she manifested

129
00:10:35,619 --> 00:10:41,083
the firebird in that last movie. So it's bizarre.
I don't even think they know what they're doing.

130
00:10:41,524 --> 00:10:46,308
Speaking of the last movie, where the fuck are
those awesome costumes that they had at the

131
00:10:46,348 --> 00:10:51,571
end of that film in this movie? They're back
to like their first class costumes. Yeah, it's

132
00:10:51,591 --> 00:10:54,832
kind of like a mixture of their first class
costumes and the costumes that they had during

133
00:10:54,972 --> 00:11:00,375
Grant Morrison's run on the comics. I'm super
bummed about that. I was really looking forward

134
00:11:00,395 --> 00:11:04,296
to seeing, you know, the early 90s era X-Men
costumes like they had in the comics. Like

135
00:11:04,316 --> 00:11:08,418
the Jim Lee costumes. Yeah, those were so cool
in the comics and it's just a wasted opportunity.

136
00:11:08,838 --> 00:11:12,320
It's like they wanted to save money or something
like that. One thing I've noticed about this

137
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:17,102
trailer is that like all of the voiceover, like
dialogue is like really subdued. Yeah, like

138
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:21,505
Jessica Chastain's character. Like I know they're
like talking in a church, but like she's like

139
00:11:21,605 --> 00:11:25,248
barely getting her voice out of her mouth and
the same thing with like Charles later on,

140
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:29,632
oh my God, you're right. Now that I think about
it, like 80% of this dialogue is just above

141
00:11:29,652 --> 00:11:35,436
a whisper. They're like, I can't believe what
you did. She's changing into what? And it's

142
00:11:35,456 --> 00:11:40,080
like, the rage. Even when the action is going,
it's pretty interesting. Yeah, exactly. Doesn't

143
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,804
get me excited for it. Like, I mean. If they
want to get me excited, like, should I have

144
00:11:44,824 --> 00:11:47,386
some? Well, you want them to yell or what? I
don't know. I think it may just be the approach

145
00:11:47,426 --> 00:11:51,370
that they took in regards to the editing of
this. I think they wanted it to be a slow burn

146
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:57,135
kind of thing. It's too slow. I'm sure the whole
movie won't be like that. We see Jean visit

147
00:11:57,456 --> 00:12:02,080
Magneto on the mutant island of Genosha. Oh,
really? Yeah, I'm not sure why she goes to

148
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,424
visit him because he does stay in the trailer.
Like, you didn't come here asking for advice.

149
00:12:06,444 --> 00:12:10,634
You came here looking for permission. For what?
To be a bad person? It raises a good question.

150
00:12:10,674 --> 00:12:14,795
Permission to do what? Like, what does she want
to do? Does she want to be evil? If that case,

151
00:12:15,015 --> 00:12:18,736
I have huge problems with that because that's
not the gene that I know. Right. I didn't know

152
00:12:18,776 --> 00:12:22,097
Genosha was in this film. That's pretty cool.
It doesn't look like Genosha. That's how you

153
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:26,038
didn't know it was Genosha. But you see the
island and then, you know, she goes onto it

154
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:30,180
and Magneto's living there with other mutants.
It is Genosha. It's just nothing like in the

155
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:36,341
comics because in the comics, Genosha is this
big futuristic kind of mutant haven city. And

156
00:12:36,361 --> 00:12:41,971
it gets destroyed. Yeah, by Sentinels. And yeah,
this place looks like a dump, honestly. It

157
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:47,194
does. They saved some money on that for sure.
We get our first look at Jessica Chastain as

158
00:12:47,594 --> 00:12:52,496
this alien person. Still not sure who it is.
I guess Simon Kimberg was saying it's an amalgam

159
00:12:52,516 --> 00:12:58,258
of different characters within the Marvel universe.
Dumb. I couldn't tell you which characters.

160
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:01,480
Why don't you just use the characters that you're
given? Why do you have to make shit up? Like,

161
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,061
damn it. Exactly, it's kind of hard to tell
what kind of role this character is going to

162
00:13:05,101 --> 00:13:08,982
have. she must be pretty important, especially
with an actor like Jessica Chastain behind

163
00:13:09,002 --> 00:13:12,884
her. I'm guessing she's the movie's primary
antagonist. Yeah. I'm guessing. It seems like

164
00:13:12,904 --> 00:13:16,645
she's trying to manipulate Dark Phoenix in some
way, to what end I have no idea. But yeah,

165
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:21,026
we see Jean Grey pull off some telekinetic feats,
like tossing cop cars into the air and knocking

166
00:13:21,066 --> 00:13:24,707
a helicopter over and things like that. And
just basically dealing with a lot of stress,

167
00:13:24,747 --> 00:13:29,308
it looks like. Yeah. And everybody's getting
mad at Professor X for inhibiting her psychic

168
00:13:29,348 --> 00:13:33,369
abilities at an early age. Right. But, you know,
I mean, he did it in the comics, so he didn't

169
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:38,183
really. do that in the comics so much as he
blocked her telepathy completely at an early

170
00:13:38,263 --> 00:13:42,525
age until he felt that she was mature enough
basically to use those powers responsibly.

171
00:13:43,105 --> 00:13:47,667
That's why she had just telekinesis for a long
time in the comics. So yeah, this whole mental

172
00:13:47,687 --> 00:13:51,449
manipulation thing has precedent, but they seem
way more pissed at him here in these movies.

173
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:59,993
Yeah, like Hank, I'm still so sick of seeing
Hank McCoy not as Beast and Mystique not as

174
00:14:00,053 --> 00:14:06,143
Mystique. Right. Not Blue? It sucks, man. It's
like, if they don't care enough about these

175
00:14:06,163 --> 00:14:10,305
characters, it really makes me not care. It's
like a really big important part of the character.

176
00:14:10,585 --> 00:14:15,147
More so with Beast than Mystique. Well, Mystique
is supposed to be mutant and proud. Right.

177
00:14:15,687 --> 00:14:19,769
And Beast, the whole tragedy of the character
is that he can't cure himself and that he is

178
00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:24,130
uncomfortable with the creature that he is.
So yeah, you're taking away this depth from

179
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:29,633
these characters that is so vital to who they
are. What are these rates going back to Marvel

180
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:37,725
again? Exactly. Fuck. You know who does look
pretty spot-on? Ty Sheridan as Cyclops. I think

181
00:14:37,885 --> 00:14:41,967
as he's kind of aged over the years since he
was first cast as Cyclops in these movies,

182
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:47,971
I think he's kind of grown into a young James
Marsden basically, but almost buffer, you know?

183
00:14:48,571 --> 00:14:52,874
He has that confident demeanor about him, I
think. I think he's great as the character.

184
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:56,796
Toward the end of the trailer, Magneto says,
you know, I've seen evil and I'm looking at

185
00:14:56,816 --> 00:15:01,666
it now and we see Jean Grey kind of giving off
this evil look with these cracks in her face,

186
00:15:01,826 --> 00:15:06,047
really reminiscent of X-Men The Last Stand.
Well, we've seen this look in early promotional

187
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:11,829
photos where like she has fire around her and
again the cracks in her skin. So I wasn't surprised

188
00:15:11,849 --> 00:15:17,491
to see that. I am again disappointed that they're
going the same route it appears. I don't know,

189
00:15:17,531 --> 00:15:22,092
this whole thing, I feel like they should just
not be doing it. They shouldn't. Right. And

190
00:15:22,332 --> 00:15:28,598
you know, the very last shot of the trailer
says Dark Phoenix, February 14th. Now the fucking

191
00:15:28,658 --> 00:15:36,020
day after this trailer dropped, they changed
the date to June 7th. Why, Fox? Why? What are

192
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:41,561
they doing? I have no idea. The day after this
trailer dropped. It's like, did they not know

193
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:47,163
that they were planning this release date? And
if so, why release the trailer when they did?

194
00:15:47,203 --> 00:15:51,784
Why not just wait a day and make sure that the
date is changed? Exactly. It's like they released

195
00:15:51,824 --> 00:15:55,785
it without knowing what they were doing. I'm
not sure if this was like a part of the New

196
00:15:55,805 --> 00:16:00,636
York Comic Con. release like it was released
just for that or if this is attached to any

197
00:16:00,656 --> 00:16:05,238
kind of film and theaters right now, it might
be attached to Venom. I wouldn't be surprised,

198
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:09,660
but if it is, it's gonna confuse the shit out
of everyone. Yeah, they're gonna need to change

199
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,563
the trailer that they sent out to be attached
to other films. Yeah. And that wasn't the only

200
00:16:13,603 --> 00:16:17,805
release date that they changed. Fox was originally
going to have Alita Battle Angel, which is

201
00:16:17,825 --> 00:16:21,567
a Japanese comic opening alongside Aquaman this
December,

202
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:30,470
I don't know what the fuck that's about either.
I mean, it was probably a good idea to move

203
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:34,752
Alita Battle Angel away from Aquaman and Bumblebee
because those both come out that same day and

204
00:16:34,772 --> 00:16:39,693
they're definitely hitting the same target audience.
Yeah. But to replace it with a PG-13 version,

205
00:16:39,753 --> 00:16:45,395
or what is allegedly a PG-13 version of Deadpool.
Yeah, that's the rumor. Is bonkers in my mind.

206
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:50,696
Who wants that? The appeal of the Deadpool movies
is how crass the character is. If you take

207
00:16:50,736 --> 00:16:55,077
away the R rating, you take away a lot of the
appeal of those films and that the characters

208
00:16:55,137 --> 00:17:01,124
bite. And apparently they're shooting some new
footage where Deadpool is reading a bedtime

209
00:17:01,144 --> 00:17:05,345
story to Fred Savage, I think. Right. Yeah.
Brian Reddell's released some kind of still

210
00:17:05,365 --> 00:17:08,887
of that, like on his Twitter. Yeah. It's in
the same vein as The Princess Bride. Exactly.

211
00:17:09,207 --> 00:17:14,649
But is that additional footage enough to warrant
going back to the theater to see this? Because

212
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:18,871
I already have the Super Duper cut and the theatrical
cut at home. It's like, yeah, is this like

213
00:17:19,091 --> 00:17:24,713
another film that we have to review? How different
is it going to be? I don't know. I guess we'll

214
00:17:24,733 --> 00:17:30,127
have to go. fucking watch it in theaters. Again.
Even though I have the movie at home. I'm fucking

215
00:17:30,147 --> 00:17:33,848
watching Aquaman. I don't know what you're doing.
I'm gonna watch Aquaman. You go watch Aquaman,

216
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:38,290
I'll go watch Deadpool because I'd rather see
a Marvel movie anyway. What you've already

217
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:43,752
seen, what you've already paid for several times.
Oh God. I don't know what Fox is thinking.

218
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:47,613
I think they're trying to make as many fuck
ups as possible before handing the rights to

219
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:51,839
these properties over to Disney. What's the
cash grab? They don't give a fuck. It's a huge

220
00:17:51,879 --> 00:17:55,461
cash grab. They're trying to cement all of these
projects and get as many projects out as they

221
00:17:55,481 --> 00:18:01,524
can, including Gambit. Yeah, including Gambit,
which has gotten a new release date. Yet again,

222
00:18:01,844 --> 00:18:07,727
it's going to be released March 13th, 2020,
which is so late. It's like I already want

223
00:18:07,747 --> 00:18:12,170
the X-Men to be with Marvel by that time. Right.
Exactly. Well, the deal with Disney will go

224
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:16,472
through at the end of this year, which puts
this Gambit film like at the last possible

225
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:22,119
moment prior to the Disney switch over. So I'm
hoping that this film actually gets delayed

226
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:26,362
yet again, and then just struck off the calendar
completely. Especially the way that Simon Kimberg

227
00:18:26,703 --> 00:18:30,485
has been describing the film recently. Like,
I think initially they were talking about it

228
00:18:30,525 --> 00:18:35,749
being like, some kind of like, a heist film.
But now he's describing it as like a romantic,

229
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:44,315
sexy comedy. What the hell? I think they may
be trying to play into Channing Tatum's strengths

230
00:18:44,476 --> 00:18:48,390
as a comedic actor in that regard, but I mean...
That's gonna come through in the character

231
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,892
anyway, because the character of Gambit has
a lot of charm. And if you've read any of the

232
00:18:51,912 --> 00:18:57,215
Gambit solo series, there's humor in them as
well. You don't have to go all out into the

233
00:18:57,235 --> 00:19:02,378
comedy genre with this film for it to be appealing.
I was much more interested in this project

234
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:08,021
when it was described as a heist film, since
Gambit, he's a thief. So that would have been

235
00:19:08,061 --> 00:19:12,079
great. I don't know what this is gonna be. It
sounds like it's gonna be like 21 Jump Street

236
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:14,902
in the X-Men universe. I know, it's gonna get
Jonah Hill as like the blob or something like

237
00:19:14,962 --> 00:19:20,106
that. Right? Actually, I might go see that.
As like a fan project, that would be just absolutely

238
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:25,170
fantastic. But as like an official, uh, like
canon kind of thing. Yeah, that's not something

239
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:31,015
I'm too interested in at all. You know what
Fox made no mention of? Was New Mutants. That's

240
00:19:31,055 --> 00:19:36,120
true. That's still scheduled to come out next
year and I guess that's still the case since

241
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,558
they didn't mention it being moved or anything
like that. In the end though, you would have

242
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:43,940
to think that them moving the X-Men Dark Phoenix
from February to June means that they have

243
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,363
more confidence in the film as a summer blockbuster.
Well, I heard that they're doing it to reach

244
00:19:50,403 --> 00:19:56,426
a good spot in the Chinese film calendar, at
least scheduled, because there was like another

245
00:19:56,446 --> 00:20:01,328
film that it was going up against, a Chinese
film, that was gonna give it too much competition.

246
00:20:01,548 --> 00:20:06,270
Okay, yeah, the Chinese market is huge now,
so that makes sense to me. But yeah, that one

247
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:11,872
pretty much does it for all that fox fuckery.
I'm so done talking about it. Oh my gosh. Onto

248
00:20:11,892 --> 00:20:19,755
DC news. Mary Elizabeth Winstead has been cast
as Huntress and Journey Smollett Bell has been

249
00:20:19,775 --> 00:20:25,858
cast as Black Canary in the Birds of Prey film,
which I'm really excited about Mary Elizabeth

250
00:20:25,878 --> 00:20:30,340
Winstead as the Huntress. I think she's gonna
make a fantastic Helena Bertinelli. And you

251
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,074
can learn more about the Huntress in our Huntress
versus Jessica Jones match. But I think she'll

252
00:20:35,314 --> 00:20:39,455
make a really good mafia princess. Oh yeah,
Mary Elizabeth Winstead has been making the

253
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:44,176
rounds of fan casting for years now. So it's
cool to see that she finally got a role as

254
00:20:44,196 --> 00:20:48,257
a superhero. Yeah, what I also like about her
is that she's a lead actress, right? If you

255
00:20:48,277 --> 00:20:53,479
look at films like Cloverfield Lane or Scott
Pilgrim? She was the female lead for sure.

256
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:59,701
The Thing. The Thing, there you go. Does she
come across as Italian to you? Sure, why not?

257
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:06,387
She can. Okay, I'm excited about this casting.
The other casting, not so much. I have no idea

258
00:21:06,447 --> 00:21:11,589
who Journey Smollett Bell is. She doesn't really
look the part, does she? Not necessarily. I

259
00:21:11,609 --> 00:21:16,171
mean, I knew that they were gonna go for a diversity
casting with one of these roles. Uh-huh. And

260
00:21:16,392 --> 00:21:21,714
I mean, if you put a blonde wig on her, I'm
sure she'll make a perfectly badass Black Canary.

261
00:21:22,094 --> 00:21:26,416
I'm not unhappy with this casting choice. By
race-bending the character though, are you

262
00:21:26,436 --> 00:21:31,222
taking the word black and Black Canary and changing
its meaning? Because are they gonna think now

263
00:21:31,242 --> 00:21:34,863
that she's called black canary because she's
black are people gonna be saying well Why don't

264
00:21:34,883 --> 00:21:37,944
you just call her canary? Why do you why does
she have to be black canary because her skin

265
00:21:37,964 --> 00:21:44,205
is black? They better not do that. I hope people
understand that this character has existed

266
00:21:44,766 --> 00:21:50,107
For a really long time since the 50s. Yeah,
probably around longer than a lot of them have

267
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:56,049
been alive So there's precedence for her name
as black canary, you know, someone's gonna

268
00:21:56,089 --> 00:22:01,470
bring it up if they haven't already but I don't
know, I hope people just don't make a big deal

269
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:06,752
about it. My biggest concern with her is not
the color of her skin at all, it's that I'm

270
00:22:06,812 --> 00:22:13,255
afraid she's not lead actress material. Well,
Black Canary is like the leader of the Birds

271
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:17,877
of Prey in the comics. Sort of, I mean, it's
either between her or Oracle, but we already

272
00:22:17,897 --> 00:22:22,259
know Oracle isn't in this film, so when it came
to this casting, I thought they were going

273
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:26,901
to go with someone who could really, really
hold their own film. A-list actress. Exactly.

274
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:31,755
And that really has me concerned. I know that
this was always going to be Margot Robbie's

275
00:22:31,775 --> 00:22:37,797
show in a way, but I always kind of saw this
film as like an introduction to the Birds of

276
00:22:37,817 --> 00:22:42,599
Prey characters, at which point Margot Robbie's
Harley Quinn could kind of step away and we

277
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:47,601
would still have this franchise of the Birds
of Prey. But it's like, how does Margot Robbie

278
00:22:47,762 --> 00:22:53,564
exit this franchise after sort of like, you
know, seeding it and we're left with these

279
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:59,070
actresses? I was hoping for more. She might
be a standout. Maybe that's why she was cast.

280
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:03,132
There were auditions. She has to be. Yeah, I
mean, there's fierce competition for all of

281
00:23:03,152 --> 00:23:07,555
these roles. Yeah, now I'm wondering if the
reason why they did the race spending for the

282
00:23:07,715 --> 00:23:11,797
Black Canary character was because they didn't
want two statuesque blondes on the team, and

283
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:17,080
they wanted to diversify the look a little bit
more, which I'm all for. But yeah, you're right

284
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:22,823
regarding the actresses themselves, because
Harley Quinn shouldn't probably stay a permanent

285
00:23:22,863 --> 00:23:26,905
member of the Birds of Prey team. So if they
decide to carry this on forward as a franchise,

286
00:23:27,242 --> 00:23:30,844
You have to cast an additional character on
the team to take the place of Harley Quinn.

287
00:23:30,924 --> 00:23:36,487
Yeah, who is another strong leading actress.
Maybe like maybe it's Oracle. That's my assumption.

288
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:41,851
Absolutely. Now I'm not so sure where this franchise
is going. Harley Quinn may be a part of it

289
00:23:42,251 --> 00:23:46,573
for however many sequels they have for this,
if it's a success, which kind of bothers me

290
00:23:47,314 --> 00:23:51,476
because I really wanted her to become a part
of Gotham City Sirens. Right. And she's part

291
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:55,851
of Suicide Squad 2. Exactly. She can't be in
everything. Yeah, she can't be a part of the

292
00:23:55,891 --> 00:24:00,554
villain's team and also be part of this group
of heroines. Ideally not. It's contradictory.

293
00:24:01,015 --> 00:24:06,098
They set her up as such a villain in Suicide
Squad. Yeah, I mean, a compelling one who definitely

294
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:11,602
could have a redemptive arc, but she can't stay
there. Right, that's not the nature of the

295
00:24:11,622 --> 00:24:16,345
character. Not at all, not at all. But this
all brings us to our question of the week.

296
00:24:20,942 --> 00:24:25,385
Who would you have cast as Huntress and Black
Canary? Post your answers to our Instagram,

297

pick our favorite answer and draw that person

298
00:24:32,129 --> 00:24:37,273
at dynamicduelnoprize that we'll post to social
media. Yeah, we're looking for really interesting

299
00:24:37,313 --> 00:24:40,615
fan castings here, it's a lot of fun to think
about. Let's move on to the second trailer

300
00:24:40,635 --> 00:24:45,098
we got for The Titans Show. Yeah, what's really
interesting about it was that it was a Netflix

301
00:24:45,218 --> 00:24:49,830
trailer. And Netflix was saying, it was like,
it's an original show only for Netflix. I was

302
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:53,933
like, what are you talking about? No, it's not.
I mean, I understand that this trailer was

303
00:24:53,973 --> 00:24:59,017
probably meant for international audiences,
because in America, this won't be on Netflix.

304
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:03,521
That we know of. I mean, we don't know that
yet, do we? Yeah, we do know that. It's only

305
00:25:03,581 --> 00:25:09,465
been secured for international distribution.
Oh. Right. I was assuming that after it ran

306
00:25:09,505 --> 00:25:13,208
its course on the DC Universe streaming app,
that it was gonna make its way to Netflix for

307
00:25:13,248 --> 00:25:17,572
everybody else to see it. No, it's only gonna
be international. Interesting. Because DC Universe

308
00:25:17,632 --> 00:25:23,035
is not, apparently not going to be, an international
product. Okay, gotcha. So they still want to

309
00:25:23,075 --> 00:25:26,596
release this series to international audiences
and the way they're going to be able to do

310
00:25:26,616 --> 00:25:32,179
that is through Netflix. Gotcha, gotcha. But
it's not a Netflix original, once again. Yeah,

311
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:36,320
it was a story trailer. Like the first trailer
that we got was much more of like a teaser,

312
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:40,402
kind of giving the vibe of the overall show.
But this one delved a lot deeper into the story

313
00:25:40,422 --> 00:25:44,584
that we're going to get. Yeah, absolutely. It
starts at a police station when they're examining

314
00:25:45,004 --> 00:25:50,274
Robin like on these screens. I guess it's first
appearance in Detroit. Which I'm surprised

315
00:25:50,294 --> 00:25:55,475
they chose the city of Detroit because as far
as I know, the Titans have never been based

316
00:25:55,655 --> 00:26:00,917
in Detroit. The Titans tower was in Manhattan,
like an island off Manhattan, I believe. Uh

317
00:26:01,377 --> 00:26:05,538
huh. So or at least Bloodhaven, you would think.
Yeah, it was surprising. But, you know, we

318
00:26:05,558 --> 00:26:10,740
get better looks at like Dick Grayson's arc
as to like why he left Batman and things like

319
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,521
that. And also Ravens. Those two seem to be
like the biggest parts of the show. Biggest

320
00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:20,748
characters. Definitely. We also got better looks
at Beast Boy's powers in action and Starfires.

321
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:25,752
Yeah, apparently Beast Boy has to get naked
to use his powers, which was revealed a little

322
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:30,737
bit more in a clip that they released as part
of a series of four clips earlier before they

323
00:26:30,777 --> 00:26:37,722
dropped this trailer. But, uh, that, that bothers
me to some extent for sure. Um, how does he

324
00:26:37,742 --> 00:26:41,685
do it in the, in the comics? Like, don't, don't
worry about it. He doesn't wear clothes when

325
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:44,748
he becomes an animal. And when he comes out
of animal form, he has clothes again. How does

326
00:26:44,768 --> 00:26:51,941
that work? Don't worry about it. It just happens.
All right. But no, we see some very like Rosemary's

327
00:26:51,981 --> 00:26:57,485
baby scenario that's played out around Raven
and her mom and like this like cult that's

328
00:26:57,505 --> 00:27:01,808
coming after her. This whole thing essentially
seems to be the rest of the Titans coming together

329
00:27:01,868 --> 00:27:06,211
to help Raven. Like even Starfire says, I've
been looking for you. You know, I'm here to

330
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:10,974
protect you in the trailer. Yeah. So our first
time hearing Starfire speak, she definitely

331
00:27:10,994 --> 00:27:17,238
doesn't come across as this naive kind of alien.
She's coming across as Hardened protector kind

332
00:27:17,258 --> 00:27:22,719
of figure. Mm-hmm. I don't know. I'm not sure
quite what to make of her yet in the role Mm-hmm,

333
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:27,861
but everyone else seems to be pretty decent
except for I forget the actress's name who

334
00:27:27,961 --> 00:27:33,182
plays Raven I'm still not sold on her. Yeah,
she delivers a few of those lines pretty awkwardly

335
00:27:33,262 --> 00:27:39,044
I think it seems so much like younger than everyone
else and I know the actress is so that's probably

336
00:27:39,104 --> 00:27:43,765
why yeah Maybe they like try to set up some
kind of like romantic flirtation between her

337
00:27:43,785 --> 00:27:47,982
and Beast Boy in this trailer and I couldn't
understand what they were saying. It was a

338
00:27:48,002 --> 00:27:51,443
little cringe-worthy. I was like, what are you
guys doing? You like each other's hair? Okay,

339
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:58,745
all right, cool. We did see that Beast Boy's
skin only turns green when he's about to transform,

340
00:27:59,225 --> 00:28:03,527
which kind of sucks. That's a budget thing.
It is absolutely a budget thing. And it seems

341
00:28:03,567 --> 00:28:07,228
like the only thing he could turn into is a
tiger. That's the only thing we see him transform

342
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:12,349
into in this trailer. Who is the cult of people
that are going after Raven? I assume it's some

343
00:28:12,369 --> 00:28:17,554
kind of like Trigon worshipping cult. Like Brother
Blood's cult. It's probably exactly what it

344
00:28:17,594 --> 00:28:21,495
is, which is kind of cool that we get to see
Brother Blood as an antagonist and definitely,

345
00:28:21,515 --> 00:28:26,377
you know, hearkens back to the comics. But I'm
not 100% certain. All in all, that's pretty

346
00:28:26,397 --> 00:28:31,038
much it for the trailer. I think it got me a
little bit more excited for the show. I mean,

347
00:28:31,098 --> 00:28:36,079
it debuts pretty soon here at New York Comic-Con.
So we're definitely gonna get our first impressions

348
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:39,640
of it. It was definitely a better trailer than
the first one that we got. I agree. There was

349
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:43,801
no fuck Batman in it. So already a plus. It
should have been the first one that they released.

350
00:28:44,082 --> 00:28:47,744
in all honesty, but perhaps they didn't have
the effects done in time or whatever. I agree.

351
00:28:47,844 --> 00:28:52,988
Yeah. Speaking of television shows going direct
to streaming services starring a group of teenagers,

352
00:28:54,729 --> 00:28:59,293
we got the trailer for the second season of
Runaways. Now if you've been listening to this

353
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:03,916
podcast for a while, you'll know that I was
not a fan at all of Runaways season one. I

354
00:29:03,936 --> 00:29:08,099
think they botched the concept of the comic
book series in itself and the fact that in

355
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:12,266
the show they weren't even really Runaways until
the very last episode. It was more of just

356
00:29:12,446 --> 00:29:18,210
a high school teen drama with some elements
from the comics. However, in the second season,

357
00:29:18,711 --> 00:29:23,354
judging from the looks of this trailer, it looks
to be much better. There's a whole lot more

358
00:29:23,414 --> 00:29:27,577
action going on. They're actually using their
powers. They're actually runaways this time.

359
00:29:27,597 --> 00:29:31,400
They're actually fighting their parents. It
was kind of like a cool showcase overall to

360
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:36,063
see, like, what each character could do. Right.
And it looks like for the second season, they're

361
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:41,751
releasing all the episodes at once. So while
I'm not. Still too terribly excited for the

362
00:29:41,771 --> 00:29:45,894
show because the first season left such a bad
taste in my mouth. You know, I'll watch the

363
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:50,817
second season and if it's good, we will be reviewing
it on this podcast early in January sometime

364
00:29:50,897 --> 00:29:54,079
or maybe later in January since there's so much
kind of bottlenecks toward the end of this

365
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:59,963
year. Wait, when is this released? This is being
released in December, December 21st actually.

366
00:30:00,103 --> 00:30:05,487
Okay, okay. The same day that Aquaman comes
to theaters. Okay, of course. I should have

367
00:30:05,507 --> 00:30:11,631
known. Why did I even have to ask? Damn it.
So yeah, we'll be getting our Marvel superhero

368
00:30:11,711 --> 00:30:18,957
action two times that day with both the untitled
Deadpool movie and the runaways so dumb So

369
00:30:19,057 --> 00:30:24,341
dumb I should have known I got excited when
Daredevil was Magically not gonna be released

370
00:30:24,381 --> 00:30:30,625
on the same day as the DC film, but now this
a fucking course. Yep But no, I have to say

371
00:30:30,645 --> 00:30:34,909
that the special effects for the second season
look pretty fantastic Yeah, they look better

372
00:30:34,949 --> 00:30:39,015
than the titan show That's for sure. It does.
It looks like it has a movie special effects

373
00:30:39,055 --> 00:30:43,817
budget, especially with old lace He looks a
lot better in this trailer than he did in season

374
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:50,820
one I think yeah, and we see Chase use the fistagons
and we see Carolina with her powers That looks

375
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,482
that always looked amazing actually that looked
pretty good in season one, too But everything

376
00:30:53,542 --> 00:30:57,984
just looks better I guess is what I'm trying
to say if you haven't seen the Marvel Runaway

377
00:30:58,004 --> 00:31:03,018
season 2 trailer yet Go ahead and check it out
on YouTube. I'm gonna say If you were a fan

378
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:08,120
of the Runaways comics and haven't seen Runaway
season one yet, don't even bother. Like maybe

379
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,503
check out the first episode and then we'll all
watch season two together and see what that's

380
00:31:12,543 --> 00:31:17,805
like. Okay, I was gonna ask you, like if we
are gonna review this on the show, am I gonna

381
00:31:17,825 --> 00:31:21,127
have to watch the entirety of season one? I
would recommend that you don't do that because

382
00:31:21,147 --> 00:31:24,508
you'll be bored out of your fucking mind. Because
if you were gonna say yes, I was gonna be like,

383
00:31:24,809 --> 00:31:31,502
uh, hell no. I would recommend seeing the first
episode actually because that's that was pretty

384
00:31:31,542 --> 00:31:35,546
much Runaway's issue number one right there
Oh really and then from here just assume that

385
00:31:35,566 --> 00:31:40,050
they run away and are dealing with the stuff
that they are now in season two Okay, I can

386
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:44,354
do that. Yeah, so yeah, that's pretty much all
I have to say about that trailer and with all

387
00:31:44,394 --> 00:31:49,118
the news out of the way Let's go ahead and get
into our duel where we pick clay face versus

388
00:31:49,158 --> 00:31:52,201
venom and see who would actually win in a fight
Let's do it

389
00:32:07,694 --> 00:32:12,355
Alright, Clayface versus Venom. Why did we pit
these two characters against each other? Well,

390
00:32:12,895 --> 00:32:17,576
because the Venom movie was coming out and you
asked me who would be a good match against

391
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:22,658
Venom. And I've always wanted to see Clayface.
A lot of people pit Bane against Venom. To

392
00:32:22,698 --> 00:32:26,579
me, that's not even a match. And a lot of people
pit Sandman against Clayface, which I think

393
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:31,721
is almost too equal of a match. I mean, I feel
like that would result in a 50-50 split. So

394
00:32:31,761 --> 00:32:35,974
I feel like this Venom versus Clayface fight
has enough variables in it. to actually be

395
00:32:36,014 --> 00:32:39,637
a toss-up, but in a good way. Like I have no
idea who's actually gonna win this. Right,

396
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:43,961
yeah, I have no idea either. And I also think
that there's some similarities between Clayface

397
00:32:43,981 --> 00:32:48,484
and Venom that you'll hear in the profile for
Clayface. They'll be like, oh yeah, this is

398
00:32:48,505 --> 00:32:54,169
a good match. They both have freaky faces, they
both have like fluidic bodies. They can both

399
00:32:54,229 --> 00:32:58,513
shape shift, you know. There's a lot of similarities
in the powers, but also enough differences

400
00:32:58,553 --> 00:33:02,576
to make this just interesting enough, I think.
Yeah, yeah. Plus I think it's a great kickoff

401
00:33:02,616 --> 00:33:07,399
to the Halloween month. They're both villains.
This is sort of our villain episode of the

402
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:11,540
year. Typically, we reserve that for our Halloween
episode, but it's coming a little bit early.

403
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:15,622
Yeah, because, well, we'll be reviewing Daredevil
season two around that time just before Halloween.

404
00:33:15,642 --> 00:33:19,284
So, yeah. Yeah. So if you haven't listened to
one of our dual episodes before, the way we

405
00:33:19,324 --> 00:33:23,685
determine the winner is we take each character
stats and we run them through a thousand simulations

406
00:33:24,006 --> 00:33:28,988
using a probabilistic model known as the Monte
Carlo method, which is used practically in

407
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:32,889
a lot of different ways, such as through artificial
intelligence and risk assessment and stuff

408
00:33:32,909 --> 00:33:37,548
like that. Basically what it does is it randomizes
their stats along a bell curve in a standard

409
00:33:37,568 --> 00:33:41,751
deviation. It compares the numbers and the one
with the higher numbers over a thousand times

410
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:47,015
basically is the winner. Right. Yeah, we get
a percentage of wins. So it's math. There's

411
00:33:47,055 --> 00:33:51,398
no bias. There's no fan votes. We don't take
into account uncharacteristic feats of strength.

412
00:33:51,698 --> 00:33:56,602
It's just base stats based off of the Marvel
power rankings, which are official. And we

413
00:33:56,722 --> 00:34:01,645
extrapolate the DC stats from that same criteria.
Right. And sometimes we also throw in additional

414
00:34:01,685 --> 00:34:06,277
stats. depending on the match, if we think those
attributes are vital to the fight or not. Right.

415
00:34:06,557 --> 00:34:09,839
But before we get into the simulations and the
stats and everything like that, we like to

416
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:13,822
go into the histories of each character and
then after that speculate on how we think a

417
00:34:13,962 --> 00:34:17,905
battle scenario between the two characters would
actually pan out. So let's go ahead and start

418
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:21,608
with the history of Clayface because I'm interested
in hearing about this because I don't know

419
00:34:21,648 --> 00:34:25,551
too much about the character and he's always
been one of I think Batman's more formidable

420
00:34:25,591 --> 00:34:29,654
villains and because he actually has powers,
you know? Yeah, yeah. He's definitely an iconic

421
00:34:29,694 --> 00:34:34,176
villain. I remember seeing him for the first
time in the comic and just really liking that

422
00:34:34,216 --> 00:34:40,398
villain. He's a really, really interesting villain.
But Clayface is actually the name of Batman

423
00:34:40,418 --> 00:34:45,801
super villains used by about 10 different characters
in DC Comics. What? Yeah. I thought it was

424
00:34:45,841 --> 00:34:50,803
the actor guy from the animated series. Yeah,
except that they used the name of a different

425
00:34:50,823 --> 00:34:56,485
Clayface for that character, the actor character
that is Clayface. I'm not sure why. Okay, interesting.

426
00:34:56,685 --> 00:35:01,890
Yeah. So the original Clayface was a Golden
Age character named Basil Carlo, created by

427
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:08,435
Bob Kane in 1940. Carlo was an actor known for
playing a disfigured villain named Clayface

428
00:35:08,755 --> 00:35:13,819
in a popular horror film called Dread Castle.
It's kind of like Boris Karloff who played,

429
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:18,463
you know, the mummy in Frankenstein. Yeah, it
was partially inspired by him. Okay, but in

430
00:35:18,503 --> 00:35:23,948
the film he wore a grotesque mask for the role
and when he found out that the film was being

431
00:35:24,068 --> 00:35:31,128
remade without him, He was driven mad and donning
the clay face mask went on a murder spree.

432
00:35:31,448 --> 00:35:36,711
Wow. He killed several actors of the new film's
cast until he was stopped by Batman and Robin

433
00:35:37,151 --> 00:35:43,695
and imprisoned in Arkham Asylum. Decades later,
a treasure hunter named Matt Hagen discovered

434
00:35:43,735 --> 00:35:48,958
an underground cavern that contained a glowing
rainbow colored protoplasm. That was actually

435
00:35:48,978 --> 00:35:54,061
the name of the character in the animated series.
Right. So having accidentally fallen into the

436
00:35:54,121 --> 00:36:00,680
pool of the protoplasm, Hagen emerged with a
malleable clay-like body and, with effort,

437
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:06,884
became capable of shaping his body into any
person or object he could visualize. The effect

438
00:36:06,944 --> 00:36:12,887
lasted for only about 48 hours, at which point
he would regain his normal form until he once

439
00:36:12,927 --> 00:36:19,491
again submerged himself in the protoplasm. Hagen,
the new clay face, went on several robberies

440
00:36:19,531 --> 00:36:24,693
before he was captured by Batman, who had discovered
Hagen's underground cavern and destroyed it.

441
00:36:25,494 --> 00:36:30,535
Hagen broke out of prison and using a small
supply of the protoplasm he had stored before

442
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:36,216
the cavern was destroyed, he was able to synthesize
a lesser version of the protoplasm that gave

443
00:36:36,256 --> 00:36:42,218
him transformative abilities for five hours.
This synthetic version, however, took a toll

444
00:36:42,258 --> 00:36:49,180
on his body and he eventually had trouble holding
any shape, forcing him to retire. Oh wow. A

445
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:54,661
start-up scientist named Preston Payne took
an interest in Hagen as he was seeking a cure

446
00:36:54,978 --> 00:37:00,759
for his own chronic hyper-pituitaryism, which
results in physical deformities. After injecting

447
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:06,681
himself with an enzyme from Hagen's blood, Payne
gained the brief ability to transform his appearance,

448
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:12,202
though it wasn't long before he began losing
control over his form and found that his physical

449
00:37:12,242 --> 00:37:19,885
touch caused others to melt into a blob, a new
ability for this new clay face. Payne developed

450
00:37:19,925 --> 00:37:25,302
an exoskeleton containment suit to hold his
form. but realized that he needed to touch

451
00:37:25,382 --> 00:37:31,944
and liquefy others in order to somehow transfer
his own physical suffering of slowly melting.

452
00:37:32,384 --> 00:37:38,426
His guilt drove him insane, and he hid in a
wax museum where he conversed and fell in love

453
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:44,948
with wax figures before he was found by Batman
and treated at Arkham Asylum. Hmm, wow. Now

454
00:37:44,968 --> 00:37:51,409
a woman named Sandra Fuller became the new Clayface
after a terrorist cult led by the villain Cobra.

455
00:37:52,074 --> 00:37:57,559
researched and recreated events that created
some of Batman's most dangerous rogues. Fuller,

456
00:37:57,739 --> 00:38:03,864
who had hated her own face, agreed to undergo
the Clayface procedure, and subsequently gained

457
00:38:03,904 --> 00:38:09,189
the ability to transform her shape without the
danger of losing control over her form, nor

458
00:38:09,229 --> 00:38:14,895
the time limit that the now-deceased Matt Hagen
suffered from. The original Clayface, the Golden

459
00:38:14,955 --> 00:38:20,575
Age actor Boris Carlo, was not dead, however,
and Fuller visited him out of curiosity as

460
00:38:20,595 --> 00:38:27,300
he languished in a prison hospital. Concocting
a plan to get revenge on Batman, Carlo recommended

461
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:34,345
to Fuller that she and Pain join forces to defeat
Batman. Fuller broke Pain out of Arkham, and

462
00:38:34,385 --> 00:38:40,148
Carlo injected himself with the blood of both
clayfaces to become the ultimate clayface,

463
00:38:40,409 --> 00:38:45,612
with all of their abilities and strengths. The
three clayfaces, calling themselves the Mud

464
00:38:45,672 --> 00:38:52,400
Pack, took on Batman. and his team of outsiders,
only to fall when Karlo's powers were overloaded

465
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,043
and he became merged with the ground beneath
him. Payne and Fuller on the other hand fled

466
00:38:58,063 --> 00:39:04,047
the fight, fell in love while they were on the
run, and had a child named Cassius Clay Payne,

467
00:39:04,667 --> 00:39:09,069
who would later grow into a fifth version of
the Clayface character. Wait, Cassius Clay,

468
00:39:09,109 --> 00:39:12,791
why does that sound familiar? It's Muhammad
Ali's real name. Right. Yeah, that's interesting.

469
00:39:12,852 --> 00:39:20,552
It was a play on words. Huh. when a cataclysmic
earthquake struck Gotham City, turning it into

470
00:39:20,572 --> 00:39:26,435
a no-man's land. He emerged now with strong,
sharp quartz crystals growing out of him, and

471
00:39:26,475 --> 00:39:31,758
would have defeated Batman too if it hadn't
been for Mr. Freeze claiming the right to killing

472
00:39:31,778 --> 00:39:37,662
the Dark Knight and interfering. Karlo eventually
teamed up with Poison Ivy to help feed the

473
00:39:37,702 --> 00:39:42,344
remaining people of Gotham during No Man's Land,
but he was sunk into the ground once again

474
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:49,433
after he tried to double cross Ivy. Karlo later
emerged as a Wonder Woman foe, after he deduced

475
00:39:49,493 --> 00:39:54,577
that he could absorb some of her power since,
at the time, her origin involved her being

476
00:39:54,637 --> 00:39:59,120
fashioned by the Amazons from clay. You can
learn more about Wonder Woman in our Wonder

477
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:05,245
Woman vs. Thor episode. Karlo's plan worked.
Actually, he became much stronger, and Wonder

478
00:40:05,285 --> 00:40:11,310
Woman was de-aged to a teenager for a time.
Karlo was returned to a standard clay-faced

479
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:17,543
self when he was tricked into a train car with
Wonder Woman. and her sidekick Donna Troy used

480
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:22,667
the Lasso of Truth to spin the car like a centrifuge,
causing Wonder Woman's Clay to separate from

481
00:40:22,747 --> 00:40:28,611
his own. Weird. After unsuccessful stints as
a member of the Injustice League and Secret

482
00:40:28,651 --> 00:40:34,335
Society of Supervillains, Karlo felt defeated
and disillusioned with the villain lifestyle.

483
00:40:35,035 --> 00:40:41,280
Seeking to reform, Clayface became a valuable
ally in Batman's Gotham Knights team during

484
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:48,111
the post-New 52 slash Rebirth era. of DC Comics,
up until his eventual death at the hands of

485
00:40:48,171 --> 00:40:53,912
Batwoman to prevent him from going off on a
rampage. So as mentioned earlier, Karlo is

486
00:40:53,952 --> 00:41:00,434
the ultimate Clayface. He can control his shape,
size, and density and alter his form to mimic

487
00:41:00,534 --> 00:41:06,756
anyone else, right down to their DNA. He's super
strong and durable and has a corrosive touch

488
00:41:06,796 --> 00:41:10,016
that can liquefy and absorb others if he chooses.

489
00:41:14,094 --> 00:41:19,557
to create sentient sections of himself that
can bond with other humans, turning them into

490
00:41:19,937 --> 00:41:24,739
clay things with shape-shifting abilities. Like
zombies? I was thinking more like symbiotes.

491
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:32,924
Oh, okay. Well, Venom doesn't really do that.
No, well, my clay face in this match won't,

492
00:41:32,964 --> 00:41:37,486
because I'm going with the, probably the most
popular clay face, which is Basilcarlo. Okay.

493
00:41:39,428 --> 00:41:43,618
Cool, all right. Well, his power set is actually
not too similar to Venom's. except for the

494
00:41:43,638 --> 00:41:47,379
fact that they could both shape shift. But yeah,
that was a fairly interesting backstory. A

495
00:41:47,399 --> 00:41:51,740
lot of stuff in there that I had no idea and
each Clayface character seemed pretty unique

496
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,321
and interesting on their own. Yeah, yeah. And
yeah, they're all kind of tied together. Right.

497
00:41:56,361 --> 00:42:00,703
So yeah, let's go ahead and get into Venom.
So Venom's a cool badass character, first and

498
00:42:00,743 --> 00:42:04,964
foremost, I think because of his appearance.
My exec and Todd McFarland did a great job

499
00:42:04,984 --> 00:42:09,765
with Venom's design. His monstrous shark-like
grin with rows of sharp teeth are the stuff

500
00:42:09,825 --> 00:42:14,565
of nightmares. and his null holds barred violent
approach to attacking his enemies, be he a

501
00:42:14,605 --> 00:42:19,529
villain or an anti-hero, is a unique alternative
to the more morally grounded superhero fare.

502
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:24,774
Venom is not bound by any sort of societal principles.
He will literally tear your head off and eat

503
00:42:24,794 --> 00:42:29,138
your brain, all in the name of protecting the
innocent. And who else does that? I think he

504
00:42:29,178 --> 00:42:34,783
fulfills a particular sci-fi horror niche, the
Xenomorph of the Marvel Universe. Oh yeah.

505
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:41,528
And like the Xenomorphs of the Alien movie franchise,
Venom's backstory began on an alien world hatched

506
00:42:41,548 --> 00:42:47,772
from an egg discovered by scientists. These
particular scientists were Kree aliens who

507
00:42:47,832 --> 00:42:53,997
studied the hatchlings called Klintar, the alien
race that Venom is a part of. Klintar are symbiotic,

508
00:42:54,097 --> 00:42:59,280
fluidic beings that need to attach to other
lifeforms for survival, and in exchange grant

509
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:04,484
their host immense power. As a species, they
were created in the universe's infancy by a

510
00:43:04,544 --> 00:43:09,867
primordial deity named Null, as a biological
weapon against celestials and their creations,

511
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:14,689
a way to dominate all other life forms. Kind
of like Galactus. I would say that Gnall and

512
00:43:14,709 --> 00:43:19,291
Galactus are allies in that regard. Through
the millennia, the Klintar species rebelled

513
00:43:19,331 --> 00:43:24,053
from their creator's goal in an effort to lead
a more peaceful existence, though individual

514
00:43:24,093 --> 00:43:29,455
symbiotes can easily become corrupted if their
host is malevolent and full of hate. To that

515
00:43:29,535 --> 00:43:34,837
end, the symbiotes try and bond with hosts that
are pure of heart. In instances in which members

516
00:43:34,857 --> 00:43:40,199
of the race are corrupted, Those Klyntar are
exiled and cut off from the Hivemind. And just

517
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:44,521
a heads up for the purpose of this backstory,
when I say Venom I'm referring to the symbiote

518
00:43:44,561 --> 00:43:49,163
itself and not just his merger with Eddie Brock
because in the comics he wasn't referred to

519
00:43:49,583 --> 00:43:54,945
as Venom until that joining. So yeah, Venom
is the symbiote in this story. The Kree used

520
00:43:54,965 --> 00:44:00,148
the symbiotes they found to empower their deep
cover spies during the Kree-Skrull War. Venom

521
00:44:00,188 --> 00:44:05,586
was attached to and trained with a soldier named
Telkar, but lost his first host, when Telkar's

522
00:44:05,606 --> 00:44:11,267
ship crash-landed on an icy planet. Venom then
bonded with an alien warrior who used the symbiote

523
00:44:11,307 --> 00:44:17,729
to commit genocide on his ice planet, exposing
Venom to hate and rage, corrupting him. After

524
00:44:17,769 --> 00:44:22,250
leaving that host, he managed to unite with
some of his Klyntar brethren, though they unfortunately

525
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:27,032
were also corrupted. Venom, despite all his
rage and suffering, was different from his

526
00:44:27,072 --> 00:44:32,433
corrupted siblings in that he desired to bond
with and protect his hosts instead of dominating

527
00:44:32,513 --> 00:44:37,188
and eventually draining them. Venom's siblings
rebuked him for this and confined his formless

528
00:44:37,228 --> 00:44:42,353
body in a machine-like prison, a contraption
that was later incorporated into Battleworld.

529
00:44:42,973 --> 00:44:47,817
Battleworld was an arena-like planet composed
of hundreds of other planets by an all-powerful

530
00:44:47,857 --> 00:44:52,622
being called the Beyonder, who pit Marvel heroes
in a secret war against villains to see who

531
00:44:52,642 --> 00:44:58,547
would win in a fight of good versus evil. While
on Battleworld, Spider-Man came across Venom's

532
00:44:58,627 --> 00:45:03,758
prison, thinking the device would upgrade his
damaged costume. Venom was released and bonded

533
00:45:03,798 --> 00:45:08,260
with Spider-Man who was unaware of the symbiote's
existence or nature, but did discover that

534
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:13,142
his new black costume made him much more powerful.
After the events of Secret Wars, Venom was

535
00:45:13,182 --> 00:45:17,504
brought to Earth attached to Spider-Man whom
he found to be the perfect host as he was pure

536
00:45:17,544 --> 00:45:22,146
of heart. In fact, the symbiote relished in
this new bonding and would often control Peter

537
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:27,568
Parker's body to fight crime while Peter was
sleeping. After time, however, Peter grew wary

538
00:45:27,628 --> 00:45:32,934
of his new costume's abilities and seeming aggressive
autonomy. and had it examined by Reed Richards

539
00:45:32,974 --> 00:45:38,416
of the Fantastic Four, which revealed Venom's
true nature as a sentient alien symbiote who

540
00:45:38,456 --> 00:45:43,037
wished to permanently bond with Spider-Man.
Shocked by this revelation, Peter rejected

541
00:45:43,077 --> 00:45:47,778
the symbiote and had it imprisoned in one of
Reed's containment modules. Venom escaped,

542
00:45:47,918 --> 00:45:52,480
dejected, and angry, and tried to reunite with
Peter by disguising itself as one of his red

543
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:57,501
and blue suits and forcing itself onto him.
Geez. Peter swung to a nearby church whose

544
00:45:57,541 --> 00:46:02,968
large bells rang to sound the hour. The Venom,
being a corrupted symbiote, was defective against

545
00:46:03,008 --> 00:46:07,651
powerful sonic waves and fire, and the bell's
reverberations weakened Venom into removing

546
00:46:07,711 --> 00:46:12,634
itself from Peter. The symbiote dragged itself
to the church's lower levels where it bonded

547
00:46:12,695 --> 00:46:17,618
itself onto Eddie Brock, a ruined investigative
journalist who had recently been discredited

548
00:46:17,638 --> 00:46:22,461
by Spider-Man. Eddie was also suffering from
terminal cancer and had just been divorced

549
00:46:22,481 --> 00:46:26,765
from his wife after the loss of his job. The
two's resentment of Spider-Man transformed

550
00:46:26,805 --> 00:46:30,959
them into the ultimate villain. with Eddie's
hatred at the time further corrupting Venom,

551
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:36,281
who was intent on either killing or reclaiming
Peter. They fought several times, resulting

552
00:46:36,321 --> 00:46:41,403
in Eddie being incarcerated and separated from
Venom. The symbiote rescued Eddie from prison

553
00:46:41,503 --> 00:46:47,165
and inadvertently left behind an asexually produced
offspring that bonded with an imprisoned psychotic

554
00:46:47,225 --> 00:46:52,687
named Cletus Cassidy, who was serving 11 life
sentences for murder. The bonded pair became

555
00:46:52,707 --> 00:46:57,549
known as Carnage, who was extremely corrupted
and went on a months long killing spree across

556
00:46:57,609 --> 00:47:02,793
New York. Venom and Spider-Man had to join forces
temporarily to defeat him using Madison Square

557
00:47:02,833 --> 00:47:08,858
Garden's PA system, as Carnage was also vulnerable
to heavy sonic waves. Venom and Spider-Man

558
00:47:08,878 --> 00:47:14,363
formed an uneasy truce as Venom left for Eddie's
hometown of San Francisco. There, Eddie tried

559
00:47:14,383 --> 00:47:18,967
to steer Venom's urges for violence toward fighting
criminals and protecting a homeless society

560
00:47:19,067 --> 00:47:24,151
living underground. Through this vigilantism,
Eddie also sought to feed the symbiotes' hunger

561
00:47:24,191 --> 00:47:30,319
for adrenaline and hormones, such as phenethylamine.
which is found in the human brain. Occasionally

562
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:36,103
Venom would commit acts of cannibalism for nutrients,
which horrified Eddie. Venom was later captured

563
00:47:36,244 --> 00:47:40,787
and separated from Eddie by the Life Foundation,
an organization bent on ending life on Earth,

564
00:47:41,227 --> 00:47:45,870
except for those who could afford to save themselves
through the Foundation's fallout shelter. They

565
00:47:45,910 --> 00:47:51,754
experimented on the symbiote and forced it to
produce five offspring, Riot, Lasher, Phage,

566
00:47:52,315 --> 00:47:56,994
Agony, and Scream, all of which were bonded
to the Life Foundation's mercenaries. Eddie

567
00:47:57,034 --> 00:48:01,536
was able to re-bond with Venom and defeat the
new symbiotes with help from Spider-Man. After

568
00:48:01,576 --> 00:48:05,697
a long time protecting the innocent and feeding
the symbiote, Eddie grew too weak to continue

569
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:10,359
as the host of Venom, and the alien sought out
a new one. For a while, it attached itself

570
00:48:10,399 --> 00:48:15,581
to Mac Gargan, aka the Spider-Man villain known
as Scorpion. Gargan was defeated, however,

571
00:48:15,722 --> 00:48:20,904
and the symbiote was removed and contained by
the US military. They studied it in a new super-soldier

572
00:48:20,944 --> 00:48:26,214
program and granted it to Peter Parker's old
classmate, Colonel Flash Thompson. The bonded

573
00:48:26,254 --> 00:48:30,276
pair became known as Agent Venom, though the
symbiote was chemically lobotomized most of

574
00:48:30,316 --> 00:48:34,839
the time in an effort for the government to
control it. Flash and Venom went into space

575
00:48:34,999 --> 00:48:39,722
as a new member of the Guardians of the Galaxy.
While out in the cosmos, the no longer lobotomized

576
00:48:39,782 --> 00:48:44,584
Venom journeyed back to his home planet of Klintar
where he was able to rejoin the hive mind and

577
00:48:44,604 --> 00:48:49,967
cleanse himself of his corruption. The symbiote
has since returned to Earth, was separated

578
00:48:50,007 --> 00:48:54,778
from Flash by the US military, and found its
way back to Eddie Brock. who again uses it

579
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:59,681
as a vigilante hero. But it's not corrupted
anymore. Correct. So would you say he's still

580
00:48:59,701 --> 00:49:05,344
a Spider-Man villain? No, more often than not,
recently he's teamed up with Spider-Man than

581
00:49:05,704 --> 00:49:09,747
fought against him. Usually it's other symbiotes
that they're fighting against now, nowadays.

582
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:15,010
Like Carnage? Right, or Venom's clone, or something
like that, you know? So as a Klyntar symbiote,

583
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:19,572
Venom's powers largely depend on the host he
possesses, though for this fight, he will be

584
00:49:19,612 --> 00:49:24,282
bonded to his longtime host, Eddie Brock. Venom
has a number of innate abilities as well as

585
00:49:24,302 --> 00:49:30,065
the abilities of any superpowered being he bonds
with. Venom's fluidic biomass can extend tentacles

586
00:49:30,085 --> 00:49:35,007
and tendrils, or form into more hardened shapes
such as spikes, blades, and hammers. He can

587
00:49:35,047 --> 00:49:39,389
also shapeshift to render different outer appearances
and even blend into his surroundings like a

588
00:49:39,429 --> 00:49:44,291
chameleon. Since Venom preferred Spider-Man's
power set when he was bonded to him, Venom

589
00:49:44,331 --> 00:49:48,773
has copied that genetic code and carried forward
those powers onto his subsequent hosts like

590
00:49:48,833 --> 00:49:53,948
Eddie. This includes lifting strength. of around
25 tons, which is actually superior to Spider-Man's.

591
00:49:54,649 --> 00:49:58,952
Wall crawling and web shooting, though he doesn't
actually shoot web fluid, it's just thin strands

592
00:49:58,972 --> 00:50:04,657
of his own mass. Venom is incredibly durable,
able to resist gunfire on his own, and resist

593
00:50:04,778 --> 00:50:09,081
even greater impacts when shifting his mass
to thick and vulnerable areas. He's taken blows

594
00:50:09,101 --> 00:50:13,765
from Juggernaut before. Venom physically and
telepathically bonds with Eddie to provide

595
00:50:13,785 --> 00:50:19,666
a 360 degree view for instant danger notifications,
kind of like Spider-Sense. And if Eddie does

596
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:23,828
get lethally injured, Venom grants an accelerated
healing factor, so powerful that it actually

597
00:50:23,888 --> 00:50:29,572
staved off Eddie's cancer for a long time. And
that's him. Wait, so Venom can change color?

598
00:50:29,952 --> 00:50:34,034
Yes, he can, yeah. I didn't know that. Why didn't
I, I feel like I should've known that. I guess

599
00:50:34,054 --> 00:50:37,656
he did in the cartoon. Yeah, he's able to change
his outward appearance for like different clothing

600
00:50:37,676 --> 00:50:42,079
looks, and everything like that. He can almost
turn invisible, practically. Well, Clayface

601
00:50:42,099 --> 00:50:45,581
can change color as well, and like, you know,
turn his arms into weapons and all kinds of

602
00:50:45,601 --> 00:50:49,883
stuff. But can he turn invisible, like Venom?
Invisible ish. Yeah, you could just turn it

603
00:50:49,903 --> 00:50:55,467
into the ground and then and then what are you
gonna do? Okay, damn it, but just to recap

604
00:50:55,828 --> 00:51:02,253
Venom's Weaknesses are fire and sonic waves,
right? But he actually expunged those weaknesses

605
00:51:02,273 --> 00:51:07,397
when he was cleansed by the Clintar because
the pure Symbiotes don't have those weaknesses

606
00:51:07,417 --> 00:51:15,114
Okay. Yeah, and Clayface's weakness really is
being frozen. Really? Yeah, okay. I don't think

607
00:51:15,174 --> 00:51:19,698
any of those things will come into play in this
speculation. I don't think so. I mean, I don't

608
00:51:19,718 --> 00:51:24,483
know. We'll see how it goes. Okay. Yeah. I'm
not saying Venom can freeze somebody, but I'm

609
00:51:24,523 --> 00:51:30,028
not entirely sure that Clayface can't produce
fire through like Flint or produce a large,

610
00:51:30,388 --> 00:51:33,971
you know, sound reverberations or something
like that. Oh, I didn't think about that. Hmm.

611
00:51:34,071 --> 00:51:38,175
I think the biggest disadvantage that Venom
has going into this is that he actually has

612
00:51:38,255 --> 00:51:43,671
a host body. Right. Whereas Clayface. If you
put a stake through him, there's nothing there.

613
00:51:43,731 --> 00:51:48,816
Yeah, he can't be impaled, Clayface, because
his entire body is clay. So he could go essentially

614
00:51:48,836 --> 00:51:55,001
intangible, whereas Venom can't. However, Venom
has some tricks up his sleeve that I think

615
00:51:55,041 --> 00:51:59,604
Clayface does not. Okay. All right, so let's
get into this. So the rules that we set up

616
00:51:59,624 --> 00:52:03,908
for this speculative scenario are that the characters
start about 50 yards apart from each other.

617
00:52:04,228 --> 00:52:08,852
They don't know anything about each other than
that the other are threats and they need to

618
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:13,563
be taken down. And the final rule that we set
up is that they fight in a non-environment

619
00:52:13,884 --> 00:52:18,507
location or a location in which the environment
does not play any factor into the battle itself.

620
00:52:18,648 --> 00:52:23,672
Right, because we don't take stats for the environment.
We don't take that into account because it's

621
00:52:23,692 --> 00:52:29,797
too variable and different characters can win
in certain environments and not in others.

622
00:52:30,277 --> 00:52:35,141
Right, this fight were taking place in the Arctic
Tundra or whatever Venom would easily win.

623
00:52:35,341 --> 00:52:40,125
Right, because it's too cold for Clayface. Exactly.
So we just cancel that out as a factor completely

624
00:52:40,225 --> 00:52:45,455
and just say, No environment for the fight.
All right, so let's go ahead and get this started.

625
00:52:45,756 --> 00:52:50,578
They start off 50 yards apart, who goes first?
Well, actually, I think I'm gonna start this

626
00:52:50,638 --> 00:52:55,860
one off. I think Vanim's gonna go first just
because he has this kind of wild, bloodthirsty

627
00:52:55,900 --> 00:52:59,822
nature to him, although it's not quite as bloodthirsty
anymore, but he's very aggressive. So he's

628
00:52:59,842 --> 00:53:04,884
gonna start charging Starling with his tongue
whipping about toward a clay face in an effort

629
00:53:04,924 --> 00:53:10,431
to just pounce on him. Okay. Which he does.
Venom pounces on Clayface? Yes. Well that was

630
00:53:10,471 --> 00:53:17,056
a huge mistake. Okay, so Clayface just like
envelops Venom and just like constructs his

631
00:53:17,096 --> 00:53:21,920
body into like a hard spherical kind of like
shell that just contains him. He's gonna suffocate

632
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:27,103
him. Well, okay, so Clayface's body, he's made
of individual particles, right? Because the

633
00:53:27,163 --> 00:53:32,427
symbiote suit can actually filter oxygen to
its host in unbreathable environments such

634
00:53:32,447 --> 00:53:38,014
as space and underwater. So- How, what? So it
basically pulls whatever oxygen is available

635
00:53:38,054 --> 00:53:42,015
between the grains of sand that clay face is
made out of and filters it to Eddie Brock Okay,

636
00:53:42,876 --> 00:53:48,277
at least for a duration long enough for venom
to be able to escape which he does so by just

637
00:53:48,597 --> 00:53:52,218
punching outward He's super strong. He's you
know, he can lift 25 tons. I think he's stronger

638
00:53:52,238 --> 00:53:56,979
than clay face Oh, he starts breaking him apart
basically. Clay face is pretty strong and he's

639
00:53:57,019 --> 00:54:02,801
also pretty durable, but he could only get as
durable as you know, like brick which I know

640
00:54:02,821 --> 00:54:07,560
venom is strong enough to punch through So yeah,
it doesn't surprise me that he breaks out of

641
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:12,224
this. Yeah, so yeah, he's punching out, he cracks
this sphere that Clayface created and just

642
00:54:12,244 --> 00:54:17,628
basically leaps out. And at that point, Clayface
starts deforming from this sphere into like

643
00:54:17,648 --> 00:54:24,194
this pile of goo and Venom coats the goo pile
with his symbiotic webbing. Like tendrils?

644
00:54:25,795 --> 00:54:29,978
It's fibers, basically, fibers of the symbiote
mass that ensnare it, like a really strong

645
00:54:30,038 --> 00:54:34,274
net. Okay, well, I mean, that doesn't really
do anything because he can't like... wrap up

646
00:54:34,334 --> 00:54:38,898
the bottom of Clayface, because that's already
touching the floor. So Clayface could like

647
00:54:38,958 --> 00:54:44,142
expand his size. So basically he just like grows
and just like tosses it to the side. Clayface

648
00:54:44,162 --> 00:54:47,825
can also squeeze through the holes and the netting.
Yeah, he could absolutely do that as well.

649
00:54:47,845 --> 00:54:53,250
Yeah. And that's when Clayface creates like
a huge like hammer fist and just swings his

650
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:58,054
like really rubber-like arm just towards Venom
and just knocks his hammer right into the side

651
00:54:58,094 --> 00:55:03,422
of him. Real hard. So right before the hammer
hits Venom, Venom shifts his biomass. over

652
00:55:03,462 --> 00:55:07,843
to the side and creates kind of like a shield
to protect himself from the hammer. So it just

653
00:55:07,883 --> 00:55:12,544
primarily hits that thick biomass shield and
doesn't really hurt Venom too much. It probably

654
00:55:12,564 --> 00:55:17,586
sends him flying because of the impact, but
it doesn't hurt him because the impact is mostly

655
00:55:17,626 --> 00:55:23,327
absorbed. So at that point Venom creates a huge
scythe with his arm and he slices Clayface's

656
00:55:23,687 --> 00:55:28,969
hammer arm in half. So Clayface doesn't have
the hammer arm anymore. So yeah, that puddle

657
00:55:29,009 --> 00:55:34,721
of clay just falls to the ground. quickly moves
to the rest of his body. So he's whole again.

658
00:55:35,321 --> 00:55:40,806
And as the pile of clay that was the hammer
is going back to the main body of Clayface,

659
00:55:41,406 --> 00:55:47,551
Venom creates his own hammer fist and takes
it right towards Clayface's face and smashes

660
00:55:47,591 --> 00:55:52,835
it in. Okay, so Clayface's face gets smashed
in, but like his face just like wraps around

661
00:55:52,875 --> 00:55:58,440
the hammer. And then Clayface just like rolls
up Venom's arm like a sleeve thing, and then

662
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:02,098
travels right up there. It gets right up close
to him. And then like creates like a sharp

663
00:56:02,158 --> 00:56:08,780
blade out of his hand and just drives it right
into venom. Oh shit Okay, so venom screams

664
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:15,122
out in agony and he breaks this spike that clay
face created to impale him and leaps backward

665
00:56:15,762 --> 00:56:21,343
And he pulls the spike out of him and venom
is able to actually heal Eddie Brock with his

666
00:56:21,383 --> 00:56:25,985
healing factor But Clay face knows that there's
a human core to him now So he's gonna be going

667
00:56:26,025 --> 00:56:29,686
for that for that human core. So he's gonna
be going with the bladed stuff now. Yeah Well

668
00:56:29,706 --> 00:56:35,089
Venom could play that game too, he shoots out
these little tiny barbed projectiles that like

669
00:56:35,449 --> 00:56:40,712
stick into Clayface and actually do jack shit.
That's when Clayface just like absorbs them,

670
00:56:40,932 --> 00:56:44,934
then he fires them right back out at Venom.
Actually Venom could do the same thing. Like

671
00:56:44,954 --> 00:56:49,977
there have been moments where like he's been
shot at with bullets, and he like absorbs the

672
00:56:49,997 --> 00:56:55,219
bullets through his flesh, and then like spits
them back out at the guy that shot at him.

673
00:56:55,259 --> 00:56:58,741
Clayface has done like that exact same thing
as well. Really? Yeah. Well, so okay so...

674
00:56:59,106 --> 00:57:03,708
Clayface shoots these symbiotic barbs back at
Venom and Venom just stands there and the barbs

675
00:57:03,728 --> 00:57:10,432
reabsorb back into his body. Okay so Clayface's
goal is to get to Eddie Brock and touch him

676
00:57:10,452 --> 00:57:14,374
with his corrosive touch. Okay. So basically
that's what he's gonna try and do. He's gonna

677
00:57:14,394 --> 00:57:19,016
turn his hand to a sharp object again, just
a point, and just drive it once again into

678
00:57:19,217 --> 00:57:24,560
Venom. But once he reaches Eddie Brock, he touches
him and it corrodes him. Except as Clayface

679
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:31,099
is reaching for Venom, Venom uses his super
agility to... evade being touched by the spike

680
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:36,043
and what he does is he creates these two huge
axe blades with his hands and He closes the

681
00:57:36,063 --> 00:57:41,887
distance to clay face and he swipes across Cutting
clay face into three separate parts that fall

682
00:57:41,927 --> 00:57:48,571
to the ground Okay, and as clay face his body
is reforming That's when venom takes the opportunity

683
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:55,276
to detach itself from Eddie Brock and assimilate
clay face as a venom clay face What yes, I

684
00:57:55,296 --> 00:58:01,652
don't think you could do that. Yeah, he can
do that How is Clayface a sentient life form?

685
00:58:01,672 --> 00:58:07,316
Yeah. Well then he can be assimilated by the
symbiote. Holy shit. So Venom assimilates Clayface

686
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:14,902
and he's able to telepathically connect to Clayface's
brain and tries to shut him down. Okay. I think

687
00:58:14,942 --> 00:58:20,986
Clayface, he's powerful enough and maneuverable
enough. I mean he himself is a liquid form.

688
00:58:21,426 --> 00:58:27,010
It's like trying to mix like oil and water.
So I think he could escape the symbiote. Like,

689
00:58:27,130 --> 00:58:31,672
what is it gonna fuse to? His spine? What does
it fuse to? There's nothing to fuse to. Like,

690
00:58:31,712 --> 00:58:35,374
Clayface doesn't have a brain? Is that what
you're saying? It's- He has a brain, but it's-

691
00:58:35,534 --> 00:58:41,618
it's malleable. Gotcha. Well, I don't know!
Okay, here's what happens. Okay. As Venom was

692
00:58:41,638 --> 00:58:46,940
trying to assimilate Clayface, Clayface realized
what this thing is, that it's like a parasite,

693
00:58:47,281 --> 00:58:52,824
and learns all of its weaknesses. But then he
escapes! Because Venom can't assimilate Clayface's

694
00:58:52,864 --> 00:58:57,990
form. Okay. So now he knows that he's weak to
sound. But I already told you that he's not

695
00:58:58,010 --> 00:59:02,651
that weak. If anything, he's more weak to fire
than he is sound over the years. Okay, so as

696
00:59:02,851 --> 00:59:08,213
the Venom symbiote was making its way back to
the helpless Eddie, Clayface turns his fists

697
00:59:08,233 --> 00:59:13,455
into flint rocks and he bangs them together
and starts creating sparks. And then creates

698
00:59:13,475 --> 00:59:17,616
an eventual- The sparks aren't gonna set anything
on fire if there's no Tinder. You're just creating

699
00:59:17,676 --> 00:59:26,570
sparks, right? He sets Eddie's hair on fire.
I don't know. So Eddie Brock is running around

700
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:30,831
screaming because his hair's on fire. He stops
to drop some rolls, puts the fire out, and

701
00:59:31,211 --> 00:59:37,453
then he's Venom again. This is almost a more
impossible fight than I could have imagined

702
00:59:37,473 --> 00:59:42,695
just because I completely forgot that Clayface
is intangible and that he doesn't have a human

703
00:59:43,135 --> 00:59:47,496
body within all the clay. And he's like completely
intangible, like you can't just move through

704
00:59:47,516 --> 00:59:52,877
a wall. Right. But like, he is like, things
can move through him. Exactly, exactly. Gotcha.

705
00:59:53,290 --> 00:59:57,114
Well, do you want to take this to the stats?
Yes, I'm very curious. Alright, let's see who

706
00:59:57,154 --> 00:59:59,477
officially wins this fight between Clayface
and Menom.

707
01:00:04,178 --> 01:00:08,561
And we're back. Not too many surprises here,
we found as we were combing through the stats

708
01:00:08,742 --> 01:00:13,466
and extrapolating Clayface's stats. Yeah, I
guess the largest surprise for me personally

709
01:00:13,846 --> 01:00:19,111
was just how durable and evasive Clayface is.
You know, he's nearly indestructible. Right.

710
01:00:19,151 --> 01:00:22,794
Nearly. He does have like the weakness of cold,
you know, but we said there wouldn't play a

711
01:00:22,834 --> 01:00:27,898
huge factor within this fight. No, and in terms
of evasiveness, he is basically intangible,

712
01:00:28,259 --> 01:00:32,218
but he's also not difficult to hit because he
knows he's intangible. Because he knows that

713
01:00:32,258 --> 01:00:36,261
most physical attacks aren't gonna even hurt
him. Right. Everything just kind of goes through

714
01:00:36,301 --> 01:00:42,265
him. Right. So he's elastic, but he's intangible,
but he's also extremely dense. So he has a

715
01:00:42,285 --> 01:00:45,887
lot going for him. When he wants to be, yeah.
Yeah, he has a lot going for him defensively.

716
01:00:46,148 --> 01:00:50,591
Exactly. And offensively, too. He has a lot
of damage potential. Attacks from him are basically

717
01:00:50,631 --> 01:00:55,694
like getting a boulder dropped on you. Right.
What he's lacking in, compared to Venom, at

718
01:00:55,734 --> 01:01:01,290
least, is fighting skill and strength. And strength.
Yeah, Venom's stronger than Clayface. Not much

719
01:01:01,330 --> 01:01:06,574
stronger. Yeah, there's not a huge gap there,
but there were only just a few disparities

720
01:01:06,614 --> 01:01:10,357
between these two characters. For the most part,
I think it was a pretty good match because,

721
01:01:10,677 --> 01:01:15,180
yeah, a lot of this was similar. Yeah. Because
they're both defensive powerhouses with strong

722
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:19,824
offensive capabilities. Yeah, for sure. And
they're just so malleable that it's just impossible

723
01:01:19,864 --> 01:01:24,187
to come up with a scenario. So we're gonna let
the stats determine the winner for us. So the

724
01:01:24,227 --> 01:01:34,753
winner between Clayface and Venom is... Venom.
Ugh. Out of a thousand matches, Venom won 594%

725
01:01:36,454 --> 01:01:41,698
of them. So you know, it was fairly close. That's
close. I thought it would be closer. Oh, you

726
01:01:41,718 --> 01:01:46,161
did? I thought it would actually be further
apart. Really? Yeah. It's essentially like

727
01:01:46,201 --> 01:01:52,365
60%. Yeah, pretty close to that. Clayface only
won 40.6 of the matches. So 406 out of a thousand.

728
01:01:52,385 --> 01:01:57,168
Ugh. So good match, good match. You know, yeah.
I'm happy with the results of this one. It's

729
01:01:57,188 --> 01:02:02,660
been a while, I feel like, since. I've won one,
so. So put this on the scorecard for Marvel.

730
01:02:03,080 --> 01:02:07,003
Congrats to Venom, I guess. I mean, he has his
new film coming out. Wonder when they're gonna

731
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:09,925
make the Clayface film. They're never gonna
make a Clayface film. You know why? Because

732
01:02:09,945 --> 01:02:14,848
they're not greedy. That's why. You know why?
Because Clayface sucks. Nope. Just like the

733
01:02:14,948 --> 01:02:20,352
rest of DC. What? The only Batman villain that
could get their own movie is Joker. What makes

734
01:02:20,392 --> 01:02:24,775
me think Spider-Man's gonna get any more villain
movies? Oh, I don't know, actually. This might

735
01:02:24,815 --> 01:02:27,537
probably be the only villain movie that's made
of my hands. Oh wait, I guess they are making

736
01:02:27,597 --> 01:02:31,779
a Kraven movie, never mind. Well, no, there's
a Morpheus movie in the works too. So there

737
01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:35,962
you go. Although I guess there is a Gotham City
Sirens movie in the works or is that canceled?

738
01:02:35,982 --> 01:02:39,345
I don't know. Who knows? Who knows anymore?
So that does it for this episode. Congrats

739
01:02:39,365 --> 01:02:45,949
to Venom for kicking the utter shit out of Clayface.

Yeah, if we could get to 200, we get to be

754
01:03:59,194 --> 01:04:04,856
official Brown Tomatoes critics, and our reviews
and film ratings get to count for the aggregate

755
01:04:04,896 --> 01:04:09,057
score, and that would be awesome. Yeah, that
would be super awesome. So in our next episode,

756
01:04:09,137 --> 01:04:14,639
we will be reviewing the Venom film. Super looking
forward to it. It's a huge question mark in

757
01:04:14,659 --> 01:04:18,020
my mind. I have no idea if it's gonna be good
or bad. I haven't read any of the reviews.

758
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:23,039
It could go either way. I'm excited to see which
way it falls, good or bad. I guess I'm excited.

759
01:04:23,059 --> 01:04:26,323
I don't know. I haven't really seen too much
marketing for it, honestly. Yeah, not too much

760
01:04:26,343 --> 01:04:29,867
in the past few weeks, but looking forward to
it. Looking forward to talking to you guys

761
01:04:29,887 --> 01:04:32,870
again next week. And until then, up, up and
away, true believers.
