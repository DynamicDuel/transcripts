00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:27,680
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi and welcome
to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,240
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,620
their characters in stat based battle
simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe and I'm his twin

4
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,660
brother Johnny DC. And welcome to this whooping
that the DC team is going to receive this week when

5
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:49,460
Ironheart beats the shit out of Star Sapphire.
Definitely not the other way around. I would not

6
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:55,280
discount Star Sapphire. She's just as powerful as
Green Lantern. So you're taking crazy pills if you

7
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,460
think she's losing. Crazy like a fox pills. I've
always wanted to pit Iron Man versus a Green

8
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:04,319
Lantern. I feel like this is the closest we're
going to get to that. We're going to run the

9
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,260
simulations later on this episode. Before that,
we're going to break down the latest comic book

10
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:13,740
movie news to come out this past week, of which we
have one news item and that is the Hulk and Scorpion

11
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,660
have been confirmed to appear in the upcoming
Spider-Man brand new day film. Exciting stuff. As

12
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:23,320
always, we list our segment times and our episode
description, so feel free to check out the show

the other shows and the Dynamite podcast network

24
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,040
this week, including the console combat podcast,
where hosts John and Dean simulate battles

25
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,600
between popular video game characters. We don't
know the next episode because John hasn't told us

26
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,780
yet, but definitely tune in on Monday to console
combat. Over on the Max Destruction podcast hosts

27

Scotty and Gilly, Pay Your Favorite Action Heroes
from film and television against each other.

28
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,340
They're taking a hiatus during the month of
August, so make sure to get caught up on their

29
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:51,880
latest episodes. And on the Senjo World podcast
hosts Zachary Hepburn speculates on fights

30
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,900
between fan favorite anime and manga characters.
In his next episode, Zach's going to reveal who'd

31
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:04,360
win between Akuto Sai from Demon King Daimou and
Amos Voldegoed from Misfit of Demon Academy.

34
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:21,460
We're actually recording this episode early. So
last week's question of the week is still active.

35
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:30,120
So let's go ahead and move on to the question of the
week. What was the best live action Spider-Man

36
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:37,160
suit and the best Batman suit and why? Record your

40
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:57,980
dual no prize that we'll post to Instagram. Be sure
to answer before August 16th. But now that that's

41
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:09,440
out of the way, on to the news. Right, this past week
we learned from the Hollywood Reporter that it has

42
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,680
been confirmed that Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk and
Michael Mando as the Scorpion will be joining the

43
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,440
cast of Spider-Man brand new day. Now this has been
rumored for a while, but it was not officially

44
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,800
locked in until the script was locked in and the
writers for sure wanted to go in that direction.

45
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,180
And so they're bringing aboard these two new
characters. We still don't know exactly what the

46
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:34,840
story is going to be, but the persisting rumor is
that Mr. Negative is going to be the main villain.

47
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,600
He corrupts the Hulk back into a savage form and the
Punisher and Spider-Man team up in order to stop

48
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,580
the Hulk's rampage. I don't know how the Scorpion
factors into that, so we'll have to see. All he

49
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:51,960
knows is it's about time we get the actual Scorpion
on screen. Yeah, he's been teased ever since

50
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,960
Spider-Man Homecoming when the character was
speaking with the vulture in prison. Geez, I

51
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,120
really wonder what's happening with Michael
Keaton's the vulture right now. Like, what is he

52
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,820
doing these days now that he's in an alternate
dimension and just thinking about Spider-Man, I

53
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:11,640
guess. I don't know. But as far as the Scorpion
goes, I really hope that we get the main universe

54
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:17,320
comic book version of the Scorpion and not the
ultimate comic book universe version of the

55
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,800
Scorpion. Because I want to see the green suit. I
want to see the prehensile tail with the stinger

56
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:27,840
that shoots acid. I want the works. Yeah, didn't we
get the ultimate version of Scorpion in the

57
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,980
Spider-Verse films? That was like a hybrid
version of the character. He was kind of like a mix

58
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,660
between the ultimate version and the comic
version. I really hope that the rumors are true

59
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:43,700
that we're actually going back to the Hulk and not
any more of this smart Hulk BS. I do have to wonder

60
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:52,340
though if with the Hulk comes She-Hulk, his son,
Scar, Red Hulk. That's a great question. I have a

61
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,700
feeling we're done with Red Hulk and I'm not sure
we'll see She-Hulk, but we at least have to have

62
00:05:56,700 --> 00:06:01,580
this whole Scar thing addressed because, you
know, having a kid in your life and to just not

63
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:06,920
address it would be rather strange, I think. Each
of the Spider-Man movies has always had like a

64
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,560
veteran performer starring in the movie
alongside Spider-Man. Like in Homecoming, there

65
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,380
was Iron Man. In Far From Home, there was Nick Fury.
In No Way Home, there was Doctor Strange. So it

66
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:22,020
seems like they're keeping that trend going here,
but even doubling up with John Berndthal and Mark

67
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,960
Ruffalo. These Spider-Man movies have really
become more of like a Marvel team-up series of

68
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,260
films, which is fine because I've always liked
that comic book series and Spider-Man still is the

69
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:35,300
main character, but it's just interesting how
they chose to do that. It's almost like they don't

70
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,640
have faith that the Spider-Man character can
stand on his own, or they're just really trying to

71
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:46,280
tie him into the greater MCU universe since these
films are still being released by Sony. Yeah,

72
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,600
maybe it's just a way for Marvel Studios to keep
control over the script. Maybe. I have no idea. But

73
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,760
it should be interesting to see how these
characters play out in this Spider-Man movie. I'm

74
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,560
really excited to see the first marketing for it
when that's released, which won't be for a while, I

75
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,200
think as I said last episode, because the movie
won't come out until the end of July of 2026. I bet we

76
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,640
get our first trailer with the Avatar movie.
Maybe, but I'm guessing it's going to be more

77
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:15,460
around January or February. At least for a proper
trailer, we might get like a small teaser or

78
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:26,980
something in front of Avatar. Well, a cool story,
bro! We've already done the Question of the Week,

79
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:32,700
so I guess now let's go ahead and move on to the main
event where we find out who would win in a fight

80
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:53,720
between the Green Lantern Villain, Star
Sapphire, and the Iron Man ally, Iron Heart.

81
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:59,200
Alright, Star Sapphire vs Iron Heart. Now we're
doing this episode as a tie-in to the first season

82
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,060
of the Iron Heart show, which debuted on Disney
Plus about a month and a half ago. It's been a while.

83
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:09,580
We haven't been able to get to this duel right away,
because we had so much to review that came down the

84
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,820
pike around the end of July. Yeah, between
Superman and Fantastic Four and Sandman, those

85
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:20,900
took precedence, but we always knew we wanted to do
an Iron Heart duel. Yeah, I think in a lot of Marvel

86
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:26,780
vs DC fan matchups, especially when it comes to the
Justice League vs the Avengers, a lot of people

87
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:32,039
will pit Green Lantern against Iron Man, which I
always thought was pretty interesting. And I'm

88
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:36,919
hoping that they're pretty evenly matched. I
guess we'll find out in the course of this episode.

89
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:42,799
Yeah, initially we were thinking of doing Iron
Heart vs Natasha Irons, Steel, but then we figured

90
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:47,580
that might be too much of a retread between Steel
and War Machine, which is a duel that we've already

91
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:53,320
done, so I'm glad this pairing found its way into
our lineup. Now since this is a tie-in duel, we all

92
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,920
know that Iron Heart has been portrayed by
Dominique Thorne, both in the Wakanda Forever

93
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,820
movie and in her series, but Star Sapphire, aka
Carol Ferris, has also been in a movie, and that was

94
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:10,660
the 2011 Green Lantern film she was played by Blake
Lively. Yeah, she wasn't a Star Sapphire in that

95
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,220
film, but I'm sure if they ever made a sequel to
that, it would have happened. Do you think Blake

96
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:21,240
Lively was well cast as Star Sapphire? Fuck no!
What really? No, I think Warner Brothers just

97
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,740
really liked Blake Lively as an actress, so they
wanted to put her in their big blockbuster film,

98
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:32,120
but I can think of much better actresses for Star
Sapphire. Like who? I don't know, off the top of my

99
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:38,780
head, Elle Fanning? What? I don't know. She
doesn't even have brown hair. We all know that hair

100
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:43,680
color is the most important part of superhero
casting. Way to fail on that one. Anna DeArmes

101
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,500
then. Anna DeArmes. Heck yeah! You know this
person is supposed to be a love interest to Kyle

102
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,780
Chandler, who is the current Hal Jordan in the DCU,
right? That means you gotta go with someone who's

103
00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:02,180
at least above 40, because Kyle Chandler's like
almost 60. To me more, that's my final answer. Good

104
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,820
call, good call. Moving on to the duel, to explain
our methodology behind the duels, let's go to our

105
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:12,220
sentient duel simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000.
AJ9K tell our listeners how you go about

106
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,800
determining a winner in our duel matchups. Yes, of
course, sir. The way I determine a winner between

107
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,420
the contestants is by running 1000 Monte Carlo
simulations using the characters statistics. A

108
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:27,700
Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic model
used to determine outcomes through random

109
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:33,200
sampling. In this case, I randomize the
statistics along a normal distribution as a way to

110
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,880
simulate the many variables that can occur during
battle. The stat parameters are based on the

111
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,940
official Marvel power grid from which the DC
characters statistics are extrapolated.

112
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,920
Additional stat categories are included such as
range, damage potential, versatility and

113
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,300
perception, in order to create a more detailed and
accurate simulation. The results of the 1000

114
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,960
simulations provide a percentage of wins for each
character. The contestant with the higher

115
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:03,500
percentage is declared the victor as they have a
higher probability to win any given battle. In an

116
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,900
equitable pairing, neither character should win
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have

117
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,760
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat
Superman, so the confidence rate of my method

118
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,820
falls in line with the precedents that have been
established in the source material. My

119
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:22,300
mathematical simulations are without
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole

120
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:28,900
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for
determination of the winner. Thanks, A.J .9K.

121
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,480
Before we run the simulations though, we like to
break down each character's histories and

122
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,840
abilities before improvising a scenario on how we
imagine one of the 1000 simulations would play out

123
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:44,680
beat for beat. And it's my turn to go first with the
DC characters backstory, so let me tell you all

124
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:51,000
about Star Sapphire. Now Carol Ferris was the
daughter of Carl Ferris, owner of Ferris

125
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:57,640
Aircraft, a defense contractor based in Coast
City. Groomed to take over the company, Carol was

126
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,820
intelligent, ambitious, and confident,
eventually rising to the role of president after

127
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:08,520
her father's retirement. Under her leadership,
Ferris Aircraft expanded military contracts and

128
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:15,160
experimental aviation research, including the
recruitment of a bold new test pilot, Hal Jordan.

129
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:19,700
Their mutual attraction developed into a
complicated, romantic relationship,

130
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:25,200
repeatedly tested by Hal's unexplained
absences, which were due to a secret role as Green

131
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,840
Lantern. Carol, unaware of his dual life,
struggled with his unreliability but remained

132
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:36,980
emotionally tethered to him. You can learn more
about Hal Jordan in our Green Lantern vs Nova dual

133
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:43,260
episode. While on a flight, Carol was abducted by
the Zemorans, an immortal race of female warriors

134
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:49,740
who once shared ancestry with the Guardians of the
Universe. Believing Carol embodied their ideal

135
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:56,260
of love, they transformed her into Star Sapphire
by giving her a powerful violet gemstone. The

136
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:02,240
gem's consciousness warped Carol's emotions,
turning her affection for Hal into obsession and

137
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:08,580
driving her to battle him as Star Sapphire, often
without memory of her actions afterward. In her

138
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,460
early appearances as Star Sapphire, Carol
repeatedly fought Green Lantern under the

139
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:18,600
gemstone's influence. As she was often unaware of
her actions while possessed, she believed

140
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:25,240
herself in love with Hal but acted violently to
control or punish him. The Zemorans viewed love as

141
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,160
possession, and the gem reinforced this
philosophy through Carol. After numerous

142
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,080
clashes with Hal and other heroes, the Zemorans
eventually removed the gem, allowing Carol to

143
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:42,160
resume her leadership at Ferris Aircraft. She
retained only vague memories of her time as Star

144
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,680
Sapphire. Though she returned to civilian life,
Carol remained entangled in coast cities

145
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,260
recurring superhuman conflicts. Ferris
Aircraft suffered repeated attacks, including a

146
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:58,560
major incident involving a rogue AI named Airwave
and another in which Hector Hammond

147
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,060
telepathically manipulated Carol's staff.
These events led to internal investigations and

148
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:10,660
legal scrutiny. When Hal's identity was later
exposed, public trust in Ferris Aircraft eroded,

149
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:15,900
forcing Carol to rebuild both the company's
reputation and its infrastructure. Carol's

150
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:20,720
relationship with Hal deepened but remained
strained. She rejected several of his marriage

151
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:26,620
proposals, valuing her independence and wary of
becoming consumed by his unpredictable life.

152
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:31,520
Still, she stood by him during his suspension from
the Green Lantern Corps, and he even funded the

153
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:36,840
creation of the short-lived civilian air force
known as the New Guardians Initiative. During

154
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,600
this period, Carol was once again drawn into
cosmic affairs when the Zemorans evolved their

155
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,320
philosophy and created the Star Sapphire Corps, a
full lantern corps powered by the emotional

156
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,320
spectrum's violet light of love. Reluctantly
accepting a new violet power ring to help counter

157
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:59,240
the rising threat of the Sinestro Corps, Carol
regained her powers, this time with full autonomy

158
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:05,020
and consent. Unlike the gem, the ring allowed her
to maintain self-control while channeling the

159
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:10,460
same emotional power. She helped the Star
Sapphires grow their ranks and expand their role

160
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:16,440
to enforcers of romantic obsession to guardians
of emotional bonds and compassion. During the

161
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,860
emergence of the Black Lantern Corps, Carol
played a vital role in reviving key fallen heroes

162
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:26,760
by channeling the violet light alongside
representatives of other emotional spectrums.

163
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:32,980
Her bond with Hal Jordan allowed them to briefly
unite all seven rings, helping to repel Necaron's

164
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:38,260
forces. Afterward, Carol stayed on earth while
continuing to support the Star Sapphire Corps

165
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:44,140
from afar, coordinating efforts from the newly
formed Zemoran central battery. As threats to the

166
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:49,840
emotional spectrum escalated, Carol assumed a
more prominent role in interstellar diplomacy.

167
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,800
She helped prevent a full-scale war between the
Indigo Tribe and the Red Lanterns, tracked the

168
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,960
emotional anomalies across multiple sectors,
and uncovered rogue Star Sapphires who had

169
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:05,620
twisted their rings power for selfish control.
She also confronted the Predator itself, a

170
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:11,820
sentient embodiment of love when it tried to bond
with a corrupted host on earth, successfully

171
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:18,180
separating it and reabsorbing its energy into the
violet battery. Carol briefly worked alongside

172
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:23,840
the Blue Lanterns during their effort to
stabilize planets destabilized by war, using her

173
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:29,160
understanding of compassion and loss to mediate
ceasefires. She even partnered with Guy Gardner

174
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,780
and Atrocitus to prevent the destruction of a
mining colony caught in a three-way emotional

175
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:38,740
conflict. You can learn more about Guy and
Atrocitus in their duels against Gord the God

176
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:44,080
Butcher and Juggernaut respectively. Although
her relationship with Hal continued to rekindle

177
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,600
and fade, the two developed mutual respect as
equals rather than star-crossed lovers.

178
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,240
Following the Flashpoint event that reset DC's
continuity, Carol's background remained

179
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,360
largely unchanged. She continued to run Ferris
Aircraft and maintained a complicated romantic

180
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,819
history with Hal Jordan. When Hal resigned from
the corps to investigate emotional disturbances

181
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:11,880
in deep space, Carol declined to join him, citing
the need to focus on her company and her own path.

182
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,119
Nevertheless, the Violet Ring returned to her
during an alien invasion, forcing her to confront

183
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:23,200
the reawakened Predator and the emotional chaos
it triggered in Coast City. After rejoining the

184
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:28,300
Star Sapphire Corps, Carol chose to operate
independently, rejecting the Zemmoren's call to

185
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:34,120
return to Zemmaron full-time. She used her ring
selectively, deploying it during major crises

186
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:40,980
that required her unique insight. During a
conflict in sector 1416, Carol uncovered a

187
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:45,800
conspiracy involving brainwashed Violet
recruits, an incident that caused her to

188
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:50,780
reevaluate the corps' recruitment methods and
eventually overhaul the Star Sapphire

189
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:56,300
initiation process. She also intervened in
matters affecting Earth, including dismantling

190
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:01,220
an undergrad traffic ingrain using
blind-controlled Violet constructs and halting

191
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,960
a cult on RAN that worshipped a corrupted version
of the Predator. Carol worked closely with Saurin

192
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,880
Iknatu of the Sinestro Corps to co-develop
protocols for emotionally volatile ring

193
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:17,240
bearers, forming the foundation of a joint
inter-core training program. Her independence

194
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:22,300
remained a defining trait, even as she worked with
how Jordan admissions involving temporal

195
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:28,280
anomalies, failed peace accords, and the
resurrection of Corona, she refused to be defined

196
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:33,580
by the relationship. At one point, she rejected
her ring entirely to experience life without

197
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:39,220
cosmic responsibilities, only to return when the
Zemmoren battery began destabilizing due to

198
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:44,440
neglect. She stabilized the corps herself, using
commeditation and precise emotional

199
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,940
calibration, then resumed her duties on her own
terms. By the end of the timeline, Carol had

200
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:55,000
assumed the role of emotional spectrum
ambassador, serving as both warrior and

201
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,620
counselor to multiple corps. She helped contain
outbreaks of emotional entropy, uncovered new

202
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:06,040
entities forming from fractured love, and guided
Star Sapphire trainees through their psychic

203
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:12,340
bonds. Power-wise, Star Sapphire wields a Violet
Power Ring powered by the emotional spectrum's

204
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:18,380
energy of love. The ring allows her to create hard
light constructs limited only by her imagination

205
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:25,080
and the clarity of feeling, including weapons,
shields, prisons, and transportation fields.

206
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:30,220
She can generate crystalline casements that
induce emotional reflection in her targets, and

207
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:35,100
teleport through violet light channels across
interstellar distances. The ring grants her

208
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:41,120
flight, energy projection, translation of alien
languages, and survival in the vacuum of space.

209
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,440
Her bond with the predator enhances her ability to
detect and interpret emotional connections, and

210
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:53,320
strengthens her power against other emotional
spectrums. Carol also possesses combat skills,

211
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:58,660
leadership experience, and a strong rule that
allows her to operate independently of her ring's

212
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:03,860
influence. That's Star Sapphire. Every time you
mentioned the predator, I just kept thinking of

213
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,880
the predator that would fight Arnold
Schwarzenegger and go up against the Xenomorph

214
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:15,300
aliens. Yeah, different predator. This one looks
more like a dragon that is glowing purple, I guess.

215
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,920
Isn't it weird that the embodiment of love would be
called predator? Yeah, sketch, right? It was

216
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:29,540
retroactively made the embodiment of love. Still
a weird choice. I'm not gonna disagree. It's like

217
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:35,700
he's like a love predator. Not a sexual one.
Fucking creepy. But that's DC for you. Let me tell

218
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:40,580
you about Ironheart who has nothing creepy about
her backstory. Riri Williams was born in

219
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:45,840
Chicago's South Shore neighborhood to Demetrius
and Ronnie Williams. Her father died shortly

220
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,220
before she was born, and she grew up with her mom and
stepfather, Gary. Showing impressive aptitude

221
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:56,800
even as a toddler, Riri was just five years old when
tests showed her to be a super genius. Ordinary

222
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,460
classes bored her, and she spent most afternoons
in the family garage building gadgets from scrap

223
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:07,120
instead of playing outside. On one fateful day,
she and Gary were rescued from a group of scrawls by

224
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,900
the hero Iron Man, whom he could learn more about in
his duel against Cyborg. Despite being inspired

225
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,040
by the story, Riri was born in Chicago. Desired by
the armored hero from a young age, her teacher told

226
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:20,860
her that she would never be Tony Stark. At age 10,
Riri made her first close friend, Natalie

227
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:26,960
Washington, who loved watching Riri turn ideas
into machines. Two years later, MIT, or the

228
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,600
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, offered
Riri a scholarship, resulting in the now

229
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,920
12-year-old leaving home for college. For her
13th birthday, Riri met the first black woman

230
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:42,400
astronaut, fueling a lifelong desire to reach the
stars. The dream was shattered months later,

231
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,980
however, when a drive-by shooting killed Natalie
and Gary, while Riri looked on helplessly. The

232
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:53,160
loss convinced her to refocus her aims from
venturing to space to instead protect the ones she

233
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:59,020
loved. Back at MIT, Riri studied every video of
Iron Man she could find and found and downloaded

234
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:04,600
old armor design files. She smuggled spare metal
and circuits from campus labs and built a bulky

235
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:09,500
gray suit modeled from one of Tony Stark's early
armors. When security knocked on her dorm room

236
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:15,100
door, Riri climbed into the prototype and blasted
through a window, flying off and quitting school

237
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:19,900
mid-flight. The suit managed to make it all the way
to New Mexico, where she stopped two escaped

238
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:25,660
prisoners. Her crash landing, however, cracked
her chest plate. Returning to Chicago to repair

239
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:31,040
the armor, Riri found Tony Stark waiting in her
driveway. Impressed that a teenager had copied

240
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:36,940
his tech, Stark encouraged her to keep working on
it and offered advice when needed. Soon after,

241
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:41,180
Tony Stark was left in a coma after a battle between
two hero factions over the ethics of

242
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:46,740
pre-cognitive and preemptive crime fighting.
Before falling, he had saved a copy of his mind as an

243
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:51,820
artificial intelligence which moved into Riri's
garage computer. With its help, she chose to take

244
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:57,540
on Stark's legacy and build a slimmer, red and gold
armored suit, choosing to codename Iron Heart as

245
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:02,700
an homage to the loved ones she lost. Iron Heart's
early outings were tough. Fighting beside Pepper

246
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:07,500
Potts and Rescue Armor, she stopped the armored
criminal called Technogolom and her Biohack

247
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:13,200
Ninjas. Agents from the Worldwide Spy Group
Shield took notice and quietly urged Riri to stop

248
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,160
Lucia von Bartus, a cyborg who had seized control
of the Eastern European nation of Latveria. Riri

249
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:24,300
flew overseas, defeated von Bartus, brokered
peace between Liberian forces and Shield, and

250
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:29,140
helped arrange the first free elections in that
country. Back in the United States, Tony Stark's

251
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:34,720
biological mother, Amanda Armstrong, handed
Riri the keys to one of Tony's labs. Riri's old

252
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,100
school asked her to return, and a teenage
superhero squad called the Champions invited her

253
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:45,680
to join their ranks. Riri accepted all three
offers, dividing her days between inventions in

254
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:51,440
the lab, classes at MIT, and missions with her
peers like Ms. Warble and Miles Morales

255
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,100
Spider-Man, both of whom you can learn more about
in the respective duels against Elastowomen and

256
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:01,180
Batwing. The teamwork with the Champions proved
vital when a reality-warped Captain America

257
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:06,520
helps the terrorist group Hydra overthrow the US
government. Guided by Black Widow, the Champions

258
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:12,140
joined in underground resistance. The young
heroes watched the Widow die, were jailed, and

259
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:15,820
were freed only after the real Steve Rogers was
restored. You can learn more about Captain

260
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,340
America and Black Widow in the respective duels
against Commander Steel and Black Canary. After

261
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:26,160
that adventure, a living cosmic cube named Kobik
flung several heroes through time. Riri landed

262
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:32,060
decades in the future, where a magic-using Tony
Stark told her to follow her own path. She returned

263
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:36,240
to the present, determined to do exactly that,
though she still stayed active with the Champions

264
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,600
as well. On her rescue near the Arctic Circle, she
recruited the new hero's snow guard to the team,

265
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,520
then flew into space to help Nova during a Chitauri
Civil War. During the battle, she impulsively

266
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:52,740
charged at Thanos, who vaporized her armor,
pushing Riri to later design a tougher model using

267
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:58,380
a Chitauri alien alloy. You can learn more about
Thanos in his duel against Darkseid. Soon after,

268
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:02,520
the Champions traveled to Tanzania to install
water filters for a village where they fought the

269
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:07,180
misunderstood swamp beast Man-Thing. A strange
portal later trapped half the team in a

270
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:12,000
medieval-style realm called the Siege Parallel,
turning each hero into a fantasy version of

271
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,740
themselves. Riri became Lady Ironheart, a
shining paladin and the only one who still

272
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,980
remembered Earth. She regrouped her friends and
led them home. Weeks later, her Android teammate

273
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,140
Viv, the daughter of Vision, kissed Riri.
Uncomfortable with Viv's actions, Riri pulled

274
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:32,560
away and their friendship grew strained. That
tension let the demon Blackheart twist

275
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:38,140
Ironheart's mind during a later attack. Viv's
heartfelt apology broke the spell, and together

276
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:42,960
they drove Blackheart off. Riri admitted she
could not return Viv's romantic feelings, but

277
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,900
still value to their friendship. Using advanced
scanners from her MIT lab, Riri mapped her brain

278
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:53,260
patterns to build a new suit AI. The program took
the form of her old friend Natalie and called

279
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,240
itself Natalie, or the neuro-autonomous
technical assistant and laboratory

280
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,500
intelligence entity. Around the same time
Ironheart clashed with the Ten Rings crime

281
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:06,120
syndicate. Their agent, Midnight Fire,
kidnapped children in Chicago while hunting the

282
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:11,520
mystical wellspring of power. Riri was able to
rescue the kids and use the reward money to open a

283
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:17,240
neighborhood tech studio. Chasing the Ten Rings
to Wakanda, Riri teamed with Princess Shuri, the

284
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:22,040
Shadow Walking Hero silhouette, and a koye of the
Dora Milaje to locate the hidden wellspring

285
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:27,420
beneath a mountain. You can learn more about Shuri
and her duel against Aqualad. Inside, she faced

286
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:32,880
Midnight's Fire and Dune, who was revealed to be
Demetrius, the father she thought was dead, now

287
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:38,660
loyal to the Ten Rings. Grabbing the wellspring's
key, Riri fell to its energy, saw visions of her

288
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:44,360
past, and emerged temporarily supercharged with
mystical energy. She used its power to defeat the

289
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,740
Ten Rings, and Wakanda honored her with the
Circlet of Bast, a ceremonial award and the

290
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:55,020
highest honor Wakanda can bestow to an outsider.
She later helped build Wakanda's first deep space

291
00:26:55,020 --> 00:27:00,940
fleet and fought alongside them against an
invading force. Back home, Congress passed a law

292
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:06,840
banning heroes under 18. Fearing legal trouble
for her mother, Riri tried to retire, but a

293
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,900
government unit called Cradle raided her house
and hunted the champions members across the

294
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:16,020
country. Riri uncovered proof that the energy
giant Rockson had funded the law to sideline teen

295
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:21,660
heroes. Public outrage forced Cradle to shut down
and the law to be repealed. During a separate

296
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,580
sting, Iron Heart, Iron Man, and War Machine all
tried to stop a black market shop named Source

297
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:31,780
Control from selling the Mandarin's Ten Alien
Power Rings. Riri ended up taking the rings for

298
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:36,560
study, but they whispered dark thoughts into her
mind. On a later mission to the dwarf realm of

299
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:43,060
Nedevalir with Mewit inventor Forge, a McLuhan
dragon warned her the rings housed evil spirits.

300
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:47,680
Riri used Forge's portal cannon to hurl all Ten
Rings into deep space before they could corrupt

301
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:53,080
her. You can learn more about the Ten Rings in our
Abra Kadabra vs Mandarin dual episode. Soon

302
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,920
after, an advanced virus shut down every
high-tech zoo Tony Stark had ever built, causing

303
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:03,240
him to call Riri and Natalie for help. The
investigation led to an old Stark plant in Chicago

304
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,300
where Lucia von Bardus tried to steal some
surveillance gear. Fighting besides Stark,

305
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:13,100
Shield Agent Melinda May, and the Scarlet Witch,
Iron Heart defeated von Bardus and used fragments

306
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:18,900
of her stolen armor to wipe the virus, restoring
Iron Man's systems. And that's Iron Heart's

307
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:24,520
backstory. Powers-wise, Iron Heart's alien
alloy armor grants her high durability,

308
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:30,400
increased lifting strength of around 70 tons,
supersonic flight speed, repulsor blasts, a

309
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:37,180
uni-beam chest laser, mini precision missiles,
flashbangs, sonic emitters, taser cables,

310
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:43,800
ferrous liquid spray for magnetic attacks, EMP
restraints, EMP blasters, repulsor powered

311
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:48,340
drones, remote communications access, an
on-board artificial intelligence called

312
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:53,720
Natalie which performs tactical analysis and
target scanning, thermal vision, night vision,

313
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:59,040
and that's just to name a few of the gadgets her
armor has. In addition to all that, Iron Heart is a

314
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:05,540
highly gifted engineer and inventor with a genius
level intelligence. Yeah, half that shit isn't

315
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:13,220
even gonna work against Star Sapphire. 100% of it
is gonna work against her. Are really an EMP blast?

316
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,280
Yeah, I mean, don't the Green Lantern rings or not
for electricity or something? I'm gonna slap the

317
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:32,420
shit out of you. Runs on love, bro. Pure love. Do you
have an LMP? I don't think you do. In a world where

318
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:38,420
fantasies collide and heroes clash, one podcast
network rises above the rest. Prepare yourself

00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:19,100
emerge victorious. Visit dynamicpodcast.com
where we settle the debate and settle the score.

325
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,700
Well, now that we've got their histories and
abilities out of the way, let's speculate on how

326
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,660
one of the 1,000 simulated matches will go. The
winner is determined by simulations, not the

327
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:32,740
speculation, but it's fun to imagine how the fight
could play out. Adrian Nk, what are the rules of our

328
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:37,860
speculation? Well, I should say there are no
rules, other than the characters have no prior

329
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:42,640
knowledge of the other going into the fight. All
they are aware of starting out is that the other

330
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,760
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.
For the speculation, the contestants will begin

331
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:53,160
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript
environment that will have no bearing on the match

332
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:58,060
itself, as no environmental statistics are
considered in my simulations. The contestants

333
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:03,240
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright,
then let's get into it. Star Sapphire and Iron

334
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,720
Heart meet on the battlefield. Who goes first? I'm
going to say that Iron Heart goes first by having

335
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:15,000
Natalie, her AI, quickly scan Star Sapphire. And
she's like, Natalie, who is she? And Natalie's

336
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,840
like, who the else would it be, bish? That's Star
Sapphire. And I'm picking up major vibes from that

337
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:28,580
ring of hers. So Riri's like, let's take it out. And
she targets the ring and launches a barrage of many

338
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:34,400
heat seeking missiles from her forearms at Star
Sapphire. Right away, Star Sapphire, she's going

339
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:40,420
to generate a bunch of heart shaped shields that
block all of the missiles mid flight. And she's

340
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:47,920
going to counter with a thorny, flowered vine
that's going to wrap around Iron Heart and bind

341
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:53,260
her. Alright, okay, so Iron Heart's wrapped up in
this vine construct and she's going to struggle to

342
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:59,420
break free from it. But I think to bite her some time
while she's struggling, she's going to emit a

343
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:04,940
sonic attack comboed with some strobe
flashbangs. And that's going to disorient Star

344
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,960
Sapphire because Star Sapphire is going to be
covering her ears because they're in pain and you

345
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,740
know, closing her eyes. And that's going to give
Iron Heart enough time to break out of the vine. And

346
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:19,920
then she's going to eject like four different
repulsor drones from her armor, and they're going

347
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:27,040
to fly alongside her and blast alongside her as
Iron Heart and the drones encircle Star Sapphire.

348
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,800
So Star Sapphire is getting like repulsor blast
from five different directions. Okay, Star

349
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:36,500
Sapphire, you know, she gets hit briefly, but
she's going to quickly counter Iron Heart's

350
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:43,660
drones with little flying cherub archers that
fight back against them, shooting them down while

351
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:50,240
Star Sapphire herself is going to fire her own
massive arrow at Iron Heart, plunging it right

352
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:56,320
into her arc reactor on her chest. The heart shaped
one? Yep. Okay, but Natalie, you know, she was

353
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:02,860
targeting Star Sapphire's ring energy earlier.
So she's like zoned in on it and is able to engage

354
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:09,220
Iron Heart's evasive maneuvers and have her dodge
the arrow. And that's when Iron Heart blitzes Star

355
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:15,140
Sapphire, just punching her right in the face with
her fist, knocking her out. Okay, so Iron Heart

356
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:21,980
lands a punch on Star Sapphire. She's just going to
spin around with a giant hand construct that's

357
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:27,880
going to just backhand Iron Heart right to the
ground. And Star Sapphire is going to follow up by

358
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:36,220
generating a massive swarm of small butterflies
that are going to land on Iron Heart, just covering

359
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:42,340
all of her armor, and it's going to crawl into it to
shut it down. Are you trying to have Star Sapphire

360
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:47,960
just generate like, lovey-dovey things like
butterflies? And? I don't know, butterflies seem

361
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,040
kind of weak. Like, they're going to try to get into
Iron Heart's armor, but you know, that thing is

362
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,480
like locked down tight. I mean, they're made of
energy. All right, while this fruitless endeavor

363
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,960
is happening, from the ground, Iron Heart's going
to raise up her arm, fire out taser cables that

364
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,440
attach to Star Sapphire's skin and stun her, and
make her fall down to the ground too, as all the

365
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,520
energy butterflies dissipate. Yeah, but before
the cables have been reached, her Star Sapphire is

366
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:20,020
going to protect herself by quickly generating
this castle tower construct that just kind of goes

367
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:27,639
up around her a few stories into the sky. And at the
top of this tower is going to be a dragon that looks

368
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:33,900
like the predator entity, and it's going to dive
down at Iron Heart, just clawing and biting at her

369
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:39,020
armor. Again, this is not the predator with like
the dreadlocks and the shoulder cannon and all

370
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:45,719
that. Well, I mean, if you want to imagine that,
just that with wings. Okay, well, while Iron

371
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:51,060
Heart's being attacked, she's going to fire a
unibeme laser from her chest that's just going to

372
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:57,300
shatter the predator dragon construct. And all
pissed off, she's going to rock it from the ground.

373
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:03,600
And then she's going to shoot an actual rocket from
her back that's going to shoot over to the tower

374
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:10,500
construct and blow it right up. So Star Sapphire is
exposed now. And that's when Iron Heart shoots out

375
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:17,880
a spray of the Ferris adhesive liquid metal that's
just going to coat Star Sapphire, turning Carol

376
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:25,000
Ferris into Carol Ferris. You see what I did there?
Wait, so she's like a metal statue now? Yeah. And

377
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,990
Iron Heart has like some limited magnetic control
like basic repel attract stuff. Okay, well, I

378
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:35,500
mean, the metal is going to melt off of her right
away. Like if that stuff was liquid, it's not going

379
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:39,060
to take long for her to get heated up pretty
quickly. You know, you're going to see these

380
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:46,240
purple flames just begin to emerge from beneath it
as it just melts off of her. And that's when Star

381
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:52,540
Sapphire encases Iron Heart in this violet
crystal chamber that's going to lock her in a

382
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:58,420
trance where she hallucinates being with her
stepfather and Natalie again, you know, the

383
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:05,380
people she loves. And with Iron Heart distracted,
that's when Star Sapphire causes a giant gemstone

384
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:12,820
comic to just crash down on Iron Heart,
obliterating her and ending this match. But it's

385
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:17,180
going to take a while for the metal to melt. So like
Iron Heart's not going to wait for that to happen.

386
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:21,620
Right away, she's going to activate her magnetic
system and that's going to yank the ring off of Star

387
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:28,120
Sapphire's finger, since it's covered in metal.
So without her ring, Carol's not doing shit. And

388
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:34,360
she falls to the ground. And that is where Iron
Heart just turns her into a smear with a repulsor

389
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:42,080
blast. And Natalie's like, Bish, bye. All right,
that was a nice move. I bet Iron Heart really loved

390
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:49,300
that finisher a lot, because it was actually all a
love induced hallucination, because she's still

391
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:55,940
in the fucking crystal chamber. And here comes the
comment. You said that she hallucinates her

392
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:01,580
stepfather, Gary and Natalie. Well, yeah, she
hallucinates Gary and Natalie and defeating Star

393
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:05,840
Sapphire, like they're just in the background
while she does it. Well, I'm calling bullshit on

394
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,900
that. And we could go ahead and leave the match
there and find out which scenario happens by

395
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:17,480
running the stats. Either Iron Heart yanks the
ring off of Star Sapphire's hand and then repulsor

396
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:22,880
blasts her, or Iron Heart gets trapped in a
sapphire construct where she hallucinates and

397
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,600
then gets crushed by a big gemstone meteor.
Comment, whatever. Let's enter the stats, run the

398
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:34,860
simulations, and come back with a winner.
Adrian9k, hit it. Inputting data, running

399
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:41,000
calculations, processing results, simulations
complete. All right, so this dual matchup kind of

400
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:47,680
serves as a proxy for a Green Lantern Iron Man duel.
And I think the stats for these characters lined up

401
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,060
pretty well with that type of matchup. In that,
Iron Heart is smarter than Star Sapphire in the

402
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:58,920
same way that Tony Stark is smarter than Hal
Jordan. Oh yeah, and also in the same way that Star

403
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:05,440
Sapphire is faster and more versatile than Iron
Heart in the same way that Hal Jordan is to Iron Man.

404
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,820
But we're saying Iron Heart is marginally more
perceptive than Star Sapphire because not only

405
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:16,320
does she have like her enhanced sense modes, but
also has the artificial intelligence Natalie

406
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,420
backing her up, as well as drones to get external
data. But can't she create force fields like Star

407
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,760
Sapphire? Well, probably not to the same extent as
Star Sapphire, but she doesn't need to because she

408
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:32,040
has a fucking indestructible suit of armor. So
she's more durable. Star Sapphire barely wears

409
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:39,540
any clothes. Another win. Right, so taking that
and all of the other stats into account, Joseph,

410
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:45,260
who do you think came out on top? Iron Heart. Iron
Heart because she has a whole suit of armor and Star

411
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:51,680
Sapphire only has a rinky dink ring. And last time I
checked, armor beats ring. Well, when's the last

412
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,630
time you checked our Instagram? Not there
recently, but looking at it now. Yeah, Star

413
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:05,220
Sapphire won our poll with our followers by 81%,
which is a lot. Actually, I'm looking at 82%. Well,

414
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,680
looks like you need to get your phone checked
because I have 81%. Matter of fact, it just went

415
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:16,300
down to 80%. I did put this up just a few hours ago. So
maybe. The point is, Star Sapphire is winning in

416
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:22,580
the poll, but does she win in the simulations?
Let's find out. AJ9K, the results, please. Hey,

417
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:33,980
you are, sir. All right, the winner of the matchup
between Star Sapphire and Iron Heart is Star

418
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:39,860
Sapphire. All right, that does it for this
episode, guys. I want to give a big thanks to our

419
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:46,480
executive producers. No, no, no, no, no. You have
to sit through this. Star Sapphire won 547 of the

420
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:55,600
1000 simulated matches or 54.7% of the time
compared to Iron Heart, who only won 45.3% of the

421
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,590
time. That's not a bad showing. It's actually
closer than I thought it was going to be. I thought

422
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:08,140
Star Sapphire was going to be high 50s, low 60s
instead of just mid 50s. Yeah, what an idiot. Shut

423
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:16,960
up. You lost. You can't say anything. I can say that
I don't think this match would serve as a good proxy

424
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:23,600
for a Green Lantern Iron Man fight because clearly
Iron Man would win that fight. You literally just

425
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:30,640
said when you were talking about the stats that it
would be. That was before I heard the results. Just

426
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:38,400
accept it. No way Iron Man beats Hal Jordan. Just no
way. Except Iron Man's armor has proven to be more

427
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,960
capable and versatile than Ree Reeves' armor in
the comic book so far. So I'm not so sure about that.

428
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:49,140
Wow, way to throw Iron Heart under the bus, bro. No,
she's still cool. She's still cool. She still

429
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:54,340
pulled off a damn decent showing against Star
Sapphire. Whatever helps you cope. But that does

430
00:40:54,340 --> 00:41:32,440
it for this duel. AJ9K, help close us out. Our next
episode is going to be another duel where we pit the

431
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:40,360
former Aquaman sidekick Tempest. Against the
Inhuman Crystal. They're both manipulators of

432
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:45,100
the elements so it should be an interesting match.
Yeah, they're both young and they're both in the

433
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:51,200
royal courts of their respective royal houses.
Yeah, it'll be great. But that does it for this

434
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:55,120
episode. We want to give a big thanks to our
executive producers, Jon Starroski, Zachary

435
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:59,980
Hepburn, Dustin Balcombe, Miggy Mathen Guillen,
Nathaniel Wagner, Lee Vietn, Austin Wazelowski,

436
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:05,920
AJ Dunkerly, Nick Obanto, Scott Camacho, Gil
Camacho, Adam Speese, Dean Moleski, Devin Davis,

437
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,100
Joseph Kirsting, Josh Leiner, Mike Williams,
Oscar Galvez, and Paul Graves for helping make

438
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:17,120
this podcast possible. And we'll talk to you guys
next week. Up, up and away, true believers. My

439
00:42:17,120 --> 
nickname in college was Love Predator, but only
because I made clicking sounds in bed.
