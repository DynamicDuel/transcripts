OldGlory.com. Hi, welcome to the Dynamic Duel
Podcast, a weekly show where we review superhero

8
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:09,200
films and debate the superiority between Marvel
and DC by comparing their characters in

9
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,160
stat-based battle simulations. I'm Johnny DC.
And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous Joe. And in

10
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:21,840
this episode we are doing a duel between two
classic and classic looking DC and Marvel

11
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,600
villains, Vandal Savage against Sebastian Shaw.
We didn't think that we were actually going to get

12
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,960
to this duel episode, but we had a few openings
largely because we won't be reviewing Wonder Man

13
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:39,180
before the podcast ends in mid-January because
Wonder Man got pushed back. So yeah, that left the

14
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,160
opening. I'm really glad to be squeezing in
Sebastian Shaw into one of these duels because

15
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:48,580
he's a total badass X-Men villain and I thought he
was done really well in the X-Men first class film

16
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:54,120
played by Kevin Bacon. Yeah, and Vandal Savage is a
really prominent DC villain who I'm surprised we

17
00:01:54,120 --> 00:02:00,520
haven't gotten to yet. He was the main antagonist
of Legends of Tomorrow Season 1, but you know, he's

18
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:05,080
also shown up pretty much all over DC media,
including being the main villain of several

19
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,780
animated films. Yeah, like Justice League Doom or
Suicide Squad Hell to Pay. But before we get into

20
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:15,160
that duel, we're going to break down the comic book
movie news from the past week, of which there

21
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,860
wasn't movie news, but there was comic book news
and that this past week was the release of the

22
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:27,240
Batman Deadpool crossover comic book that
featured new DC and Marvel crossover stories that

23
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,240
we're going to talk about. As always, we list our
segment times and our episode description, so

24
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:35,240
feel free to check out the show notes if you want to

45
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:32,520
the way, quick to the no prize. A no prize is an award
that Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version,

46
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,440
the dynamic duel no prize, is a digital award we
post on Instagram for the person that we feel gave

47
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,020
the best answer to our question of the week. Last
week, we asked you guys, what Marvel versus DC

48
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:48,880
crossover have you always wanted to see in the
comic books? And why? We got a few answers, so let's

49
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,880
run down our honorable mentions as well as the no
prize winner. Our first honorable mention goes to

50
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:00,940
Was, who I'm just going to assume is Steve Wasniak,
the co-founder of Apple. He said, Hi, this is the

51
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:10,120
Was, and I'm calling to give my opinion on who I
would want to see from DC and Marvel fight. And

52
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,720
maybe this has already been done in the comics and I
just haven't seen it. You can let me know. But I want

53
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,680
to see Superman versus the Hulk, because what
really can kill the Hulk? Not much anything. So I'm

54
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,600
not surprised you didn't know the answer to this,
Steve Wasniak, because you were helping to

55
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,060
develop Apple in the mid 90s when the DC versus
Marvel comic crossover came out, in which

56
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:37,820
Superman did in fact fight the Hulk and defeat him.
Yeah. So wasn't the Superman Hulk matchup one of

57
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:43,100
the voted on battles within that comic book
series? I believe it was, yes. So really, it was

58
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:49,880
just a popularity contest. The Hulk could have won
if the fans had voted that way. But luckily, we have

59
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:55,900
a podcast that has determined that Superman would
in fact beat the Hulk, no matter which iteration,

60
00:05:55,900 --> 00:06:00,080
because Superman is just better. We don't know
that. We haven't determined that. What are you

61
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,140
talking about? Kingdom Come Superman beat
Maestro. Oh, yeah. Bizarro beat Abomination.

62
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:10,600
Isn't that enough? I still think there's a chance
that the Hulk can beat Superman. We'll see. Maybe

63
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,280
in a few months, we'll actually run the stats on
that. Hey, shut up. Great answer, Steve Wasniak.

64
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,680
Our next honorable mention goes to Daniel Alonso,
who said, Okay, so I know this is going to be really

65
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:28,660
hard for everybody because DC has so very few
actually good characters that are cool. But one

66
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:35,840
that I actually just really, really, really would
love to see is King Daredevil and Fallen Grayson

67
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,860
Nightwing team up together. I think that would be
so sick if like they were going up against the hand

68
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:48,860
that teamed up with the quarter vowels. I mean,
come on. And they would look amazing. Yeah, they

69
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:54,700
would look amazing because of their beards,
right? This is the era of each character's arcs

70
00:06:54,700 --> 00:07:01,360
where they grew heavy beards. Daredevil had taken
over as like the new kingpin and he had some magical

71
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:07,760
amped up senses. Yeah. And in the Fallen Grayson
storyline, Dick Grayson is captured and

72
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:13,040
seemingly killed. So they have to essentially
fake his death. And during that time, he became a

73
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,760
secret agent who, yes, also had a beard. And then
going up against the hand and the quarter vowels.

74
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,720
Hell yeah. Hell yeah. Great answer, Daniel
Alonso. Our final honorable mention would go to by

75
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,840
Dear Bangor. But unfortunately, the audio was too
quite to make out, but we still want to say thank you

76
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:35,640
for calling in. The winner of this week's snow
prize is Alex Albro, who said, Hey guys, for me,

77
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,900
it's got to be Black Panther versus Hawkman. Maybe
they're trying to enhance new medical security

78
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,780
weaponry developments with vibranium keeping
out extraterrestrial threats the whole deal. And

79
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,200
they realize it's not enough and they need to use
enthmetal. Hawkman doesn't take too kindly to

80
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:54,780
this and decides maybe he wants vibranium for
himself and his people. And so it just brings down

81
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,160
the wrath of Danagar and Wakanda. I think seeing
these two guys go to war would be epic. I think they

82
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:05,540
have a lot more in common than the Metsuii. And this
would just be insane. This sounds amazing as

83
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:12,420
everyone knows metal that can absorb vibrations
is way better than metal that can defy gravity. I

84
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:19,200
mean, is it? I don't think it is. I think gravity
defying metal and really universal forces

85
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:25,780
defying metal is way cooler than just metal that
fucking vibrates, bro. It doesn't vibrate. It

86
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:30,220
absorbs vibrations. You're confusing it for
Antarctic vibranium. Think about it. Would you

87
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:37,320
rather stop vibrations or freaking fly? It's
essentially bulletproof metal. I mean, so is a lot

88
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,960
of metals. Fair enough. Fair enough. I think the
dynamic between a character like Black Panther

89
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:48,960
and Hawkman would play out pretty well, too,
though. They're both pretty badass. Oh, yeah.

90
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,380
Yeah. I would love to see those characters
crossover. Who do you think would win in a fight

91
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:57,320
between the Wakandans and the Thanagarians? Oh,
Thanagarians. All they would have to do is just

92
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:04,320
drop a bomb on them from space. Although Wakandans
would have to do is just fire a missile at them from

93
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,920
Earth. Oh, and then they could just move their ship
out of orbit and dodge the missile entirely. Can

94
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,680
you move Wakanda? No, but it has a protective dome.
So, oh, yeah, that's right. Air superiority, my

95
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:22,020
man. What else can I say? Well, Wakandans were the
first people from Earth to really start

96
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:26,420
interstellar colonies. So I mean, they're no
strangers to space. Oh, they're just starting

97
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:31,440
out. That's cute. No, they've been at it for a
while. Like it was due to a time anomaly. There are

98
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:38,240
Wakandan space colonies in Marvel Comics. Full
on. Dude, Thanagar is a space empire. Think of them

99
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,700
like the Shi'ar. The Wakandans are nothing like
the Shi'ar. No, they're better. Do they have an

100
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,420
imperial guard? No, but they have the Dormalage.
Anyway, we're getting off track here. We could

101
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:52,460
probably dedicate an entire episode to Wakanda
versus Thanagar, I think. Just hold your

102
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:57,240
thoughts. Let's agree that Wakanda would win.
Let's move on. So thank you, Alex Albra, for

103
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,920
calling in with your no prize winning answer. Oh,
I'm not ready to move on. If you, the listener, want

104
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,120
a shot at winning your own no prize, stay tuned to
later on this episode when we'll be asking another

105
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,200
question of the week. But now that that's done, you
know why Thanagar would win? Why? Because they

106
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,940
reincarnate, whereas Wakandans just go to their
ancestral plane and they could stay there. But

107
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,800
it's not like they fall down dead and then rise up
right away. They reincarnate like on the other

108
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,480
side of the fucking universe. So it's fine. It's
fine. They move fast. OK. And now that that's done,

109
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:36,280
on to the news. All right, last week, we talked to
you guys about the digital comic books that Marble

110
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:42,920
and DC released that were crossovers for Thor and
Shazam and The Flash and Fantastic Four. Those

111
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:49,100
digital issues were released in lead up to this
past week's physical comic book release of Batman

112
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:54,400
Deadpool, which was the second part of a comic book
crossover between Marvel and DC. We talked about

113
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,400
the Deadpool Batman crossover when that came out.
And we talked about what we liked and didn't like

114
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:05,700
from the issue. I do have to say that the DC series of
stories didn't blow me away like the Marvel one

115
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:10,880
did. Like I was a huge fan of the Deadpool Batman
crossover story written by Zeb Wells. I was a big

116
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,940
fan. Grant Morrison wrote this issues, Batman,
Deadpool crossover. And, you know, Grant

117
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:24,080
Morrison is a he's a legend. He's really talented.
That being said, I found his work in this issue to be

118
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:29,800
a little bit masturbatory for lack of a better
word, because not only did he insert himself into

119
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:36,460
the story, he also inserted his Cassandra Nova and
Damien Wayne creations. And the story in all was

120
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:41,880
just a little all over the place. It wasn't as clean
and pure as the Zeb Wells story. Well, you know,

121
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:48,040
with Grant Morrison, his stories haven't been
cleaned for a long time. I'm not a huge Grant

122
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:54,020
Morrison fan. Really? I think because of that
reason. I think if you're going to tell a good

123
00:11:54,020 --> 00:12:01,420
story, it shouldn't be that dense. It shouldn't be
that difficult to interpret what is going on. He's

124
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:07,680
like the Christopher Nolan of comic book writers.
He tries to be, but he's less accessible. You know,

125
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,560
I thought the story was actually really good upon
second read, but you had to read it twice to

126
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,980
appreciate it. Sometimes that's just the case
with like nonlinear storytelling. There are a lot

127
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:23,020
of stories out there that I enjoy more upon second
read or second rewatch. Well, it's not about

128
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:27,300
enjoying it more. It's about basically
understanding it. And I understood it more the

129
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:33,840
second time. Therefore, I enjoyed it more. It's a
choice. It's a choice that I think proves to be less

130
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,400
successful than the Marvel version of the
crossover. I do think you're right in that Marvel

131
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,800
is better than DC. Yes. I did not say that. Yeah,
it's hard to tell which set of stories was better

132
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:50,300
because while the Marvel release had the better
Deadpool Batman story, it also had shit like The

133
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:56,020
Dark Knight, an old man Logan story and like the
crypto and Jeff the Landshark story. There was

134
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:01,260
nothing that was quite as pointless in this DC
issue. In addition to the Batman Deadpool story,

135
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:07,840
we also got Constantine meets Doctor Strange,
Nightwing and Laura Kinney's Wolverine, Harley

136
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,460
Quinn and the Hulk and Static versus Miss Marvel.
And I enjoyed all of those, except for maybe the

137
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:18,440
Harley Quinn Hulk one. I was expecting more from
that, although I don't know why. Yeah, that was my

138
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:23,500
least favorite, too. The rest were fine. Overall,
a decent effort. And the last comic, my favorite

139
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,000
was the Wonder Woman Captain America story. And
this one, I would say my favorite was the Nightwing

140
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,620
Wolverine one. That was good. I also really liked
the Static Miss Marvel one. It was really short,

141
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:39,580
but it was nice to see the parallels between the two
characters. I'll leave it vague there. We highly

142
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:45,340
recommend visiting your local comic book store
and picking up a few issues of Deadpool Batman and

143
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,660
Batman Deadpool. Take advantage of this
historical moment while you can, folks. It only

144
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,220
happens once every few decades. I mean, I hope they
do more crossovers. I'm actually really loving

145
00:13:55,220 --> 00:14:01,340
this Infiniverse or whatever they want to call it,
where the two universes join together. And next

146
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:07,320
time they better do a Hawkman Black Panther story.
That would be cool. I would also accept a Black

147
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,720
Panther Aquaman story. Oh, that'd be cool, too,
for sure. But speaking of comic book crossovers

148
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:22,080
within this issue, that brings us to our question
of the week. What was your favorite story within

149
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:28,940
the Batman Deadpool crossover comic? And why this
is for the comic book readers out there? Those of

150
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,680
you who picked up and read the issue, go ahead and

155
00:14:51,720 --> 00:15:03,120
29th. But that is it for all of the news for this
episode. Let's go ahead and move on to the main

156
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:10,700
event where we find out who is going to win between
the villain characters of Vandal Savage and

157
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:31,180
Sebastian Shaw. Vandal Savage vs Sebastian Shaw
OK, Vandal Savage vs Sebastian Shaw. Now, for the

158
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:36,860
longest time, I didn't really know who we could pit
Vandal Savage against considering his main power

159
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,100
is essentially that he's immortal. He has
something of a healing factor as well. But I

160
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,780
couldn't figure out who a good analog would be
against him until whenever executive producers,

161
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:51,960
Devin Davis, suggested pitting him against
Sebastian Shaw largely because of how the

162
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:58,300
characters look. They both look very, I guess you
could say, Victorian. I guess you could describe

163
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,620
it as that they both wear very old fashioned suits,
like three piece suits. It's part of the wardrobe

164
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,540
for the inner circle of the Hellfire Club, of which
Sebastian Shaw is one of the leaders.

165
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:13,040
Traditionally, he's known as the Black King
because all of the inner circle members are named

166
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,640
after chess pieces. Yeah, they have an
interesting wardrobe, like the guys dress up like

167
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:24,320
they're from 1800s Britain and the women dress up
in lingerie. What is going on there? I don't know. I

168
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,060
don't know. It does seem like a double standard, if
I must say. Of course, we did a duel with the White

169
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:34,220
Queen Emma Frost against Poison Ivy quite a few
years ago. And that was a fun episode. You guys

170
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,380
should definitely go check that out if you want to
learn more about the Hellfire Club. We also did a

171
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,800
duel between mastermind of the Hellfire Club and
Psycho Pirate, where we also delved into that

172
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,640
club's history. Vandal Savage has been a part of a
number of teams, which I'll break down in the

173
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,220
character's backstory. But first, to explain the
methodology behind our duels, let's go to our

174
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:59,700
sentient duel simulator, Alfred Jarvis, 9000.
AJ9K tell our listeners how you go about

175
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:05,760
determining a winner in our duel matchups. Yes, of
course, sir. The way I determine a winner between

176
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,380
the contestants is by running 1000 Monte Carlo
simulations using the character's statistics. A

177
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,640
Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic model
used to determine outcomes through random

178
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:21,140
sampling. In this case, I randomize the
statistics along a normal distribution as a way to

179
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:25,819
simulate the many variables that can occur during
battle. The stat parameters are based on the

180
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:30,360
official Marvel power grid from which the DC
characters' statistics are extrapolated.

181
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,880
Additional stat categories are included such as
range, damage potential, versatility and

182
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:41,380
perception in order to create a more detailed and
accurate simulation. The results of the 1000

183
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:45,900
simulations provide a percentage of wins for each
character. The contestant with the higher

184
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:51,440
percentage is declared the victor as they have a
higher probability to win any given battle. In an

185
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,860
equitable pairing, neither character should win
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have

186
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,740
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat
Superman, so the confidence rate of my method

187
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,780
falls in line with the precedents that have been
established in the source material. My

188
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,260
mathematical simulations are without
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole

189
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:16,540
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K.

190
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,900
Before we run the simulations, though, we'd like
to break down each of the character's histories

191
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:25,380
and abilities before improvising a scenario on
how we imagined one of the 1000 simulations would

192
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:31,280
play out beat for beat. And it's my turn to go first
with the DC characters backstory, so let me tell

193
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:39,920
you all about Vandal Savage. Now, Vandar Og was
born roughly 50,000 years ago as the chief of the

194
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:46,140
Crow Magnan Blood Tribe. As a young hunter, he
witnessed a glowing meteor crash to Earth.

195
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:51,980
Exposure to its radiation, later understood to
contain microscopic tech-tites, dramatically

196
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:58,920
increased his intelligence, halted his aging and
made him effectively immortal. A rival caveman of

197
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:05,360
the Bear Tribe claimed a fragment of the same
meteor as an amulet and became the immortal man,

198
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,900
destined to reincarnate endlessly and oppose
Vandar throughout history. Over the centuries

199
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:17,900
that followed, Vandar adopted many names and
roles. At times, he acted openly as Warlord, King,

200
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:23,800
Conqueror or Pharaoh. At others, he served as
advisor, strategist or manipulator behind the

201
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,400
scenes. He claimed numerous historical
identities, though many were exaggerations

202
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:33,920
meant to magnify his legend. His immortality
allowed him to gather knowledge of warfare,

203
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:40,540
politics, culture and science across multiple
eras. And his mastery of strategy made him a

204
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:46,680
recurring architect of upheaval. In ancient
Atlantis, Vandal founded a secret society known

205
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:52,280
as the Children of Light, whose influence helped
destabilize Atlantean power. Before the

206
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:58,400
continent sank, his followers spread across the
world as the Illuminati. In Egypt, he ruled as

207
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,240
Coffrey, until Nubu the Wise forged a mystical
symbol of power to overthrow him, beginning a

208
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,920
conflict that echoed through their
incarnations. In Europe, Asia and the

209
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:15,080
Mediterranean world, Vandal served or opposed
leaders ranging from Napoleon and Bismarck to

210
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,560
Genghis Khan. Across the ages, he repeatedly
clashed with reincarnating enemies, such as

211
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:26,020
Prince Khufu and Shaira, later known as Hockman
and Hock Girl, and with the immortal man and

212
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:32,160
resurrection man, whose tectite-linked powers
mirrored his own. His immortality was imperfect,

213
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,760
however. The tectite's healed wounds but also
preserved an early intestinal cancer, causing

214
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,840
periodic agony throughout his life. To survive
catastrophic injuries or organ failure, he

215
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,420
periodically relied on descendants whose
genetic material could restore failing tissues.

216
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,460
As civilization progressed, Vandal Savage
continued shaping events from the shadows. In the

217
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:59,960
20th century, he confronted the Justice Society
of America, beginning a recurring rivalry with

218
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,840
the Green Lantern Alan Scott, who you can learn
more about in our Green Lantern vs. Iceman duel

219
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:10,300
episode. When the Justice Society retired in the
1950s under pressure from the House Un-American

220
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:15,760
Activities Committee, Savage helped engineer
political pressure to force their withdrawal,

221
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:21,320
clearing the stage for later plans. As
superheroes re-emerged, Vandal expanded his

222
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,500
operations with scientific research, funding
projects through shell organizations and

223
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:32,940
adopting new identities. Under aliases such as
Burt Villars, he confronted Wally West, the

224
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:38,240
Flash, who exposed Savage's involvement in
experiments and illegal dealings. Savage

225
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,520
pioneered the Super Speed Drug Velocity 9,
distributing it through criminal networks with

226
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,680
the intent of creating an army of addicted
supercriminals. The drug caused rapid aging and

227
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:55,700
strokes, and the Flash dismantled the operation.
You can learn more about Wally West in our Flash vs.

228
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:01,240
Speedball episode. Savage's immortality
occasionally faltered, forcing him to pursue

229
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:07,520
methods to replenish it. Savage financed a
clandestine research group known only as the Lab,

230
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,520
directing its scientists to replicate the
tectites that sustained his immortality. Their

231
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:18,360
experiments on unwilling subjects, including an
amnesiac man named Mitch Shelley, led to the

232
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,980
creation of the Resurrection Man. When a time
warped tectite creature threatened reality,

233
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:29,140
Savage temporarily allied with Immortal Man and
Resurrection Man. Immortal Man sacrificed

234
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:34,560
himself to destroy the creature, ending the
ancient rivalry. The Resurrection Man inherited

235
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:40,280
the role of Savage's primary adversary. Seeking
further influence, Savage manipulated

236
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:46,440
conflicts involving the new Titans. He founded
the villain team Tartarus using Gohman's powers

237
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:52,840
to select members, then targeted Adeline Wilson
for her blood in a new immortality serum. The

238
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,200
Titans stopped him after a violent confrontation
that left several villains dead or defecting. You

239
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,340
can learn more about the Titans in their team duel
against the X-Men. Savage's descent toward more

240
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:09,220
extreme measures continued. He became the leader
of a doomsday cult and obtained an alien summoner

241
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:15,120
device capable of dragging an asteroid named
Thanatos toward Earth. Savage intended to

242
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,680
engineer a mass extinction and remake
civilization from the ruins, though the Flash

243
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:25,240
reversed the summoner's pull, sending the
asteroid away. Savage deliberately threw

244
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:31,220
himself onto the beam, believing a second meteor
exposure would elevate his power, and he was

245
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:36,960
hurled into space on the redirected rock. He
survived the journey and in time returned to

246
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,080
Earth. His next major conflict placed him at odds
with the Justice Society again. Savage formed the

247
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:48,460
Fourth Reich, a group of neo-Nazi metahumans
tasked with exterminating the descendants of

248
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:53,860
Golden Age heroes. They murdered several
families before being defeated. Savage was

249
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:59,200
struck down by a fire truck in the final battle but
later escaped. Savage was eventually captured

250
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:05,760
and sent to the Salvation Planet alongside other
villains. He established a temporary domain by

251
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,740
exploiting female villains, but the group
rebelled and he fled during an attack from

252
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:16,760
apocalyptic forces. Savage resurfaced during
the final crisis as a high ranking member of the

253
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:22,320
Society of Supervillains. The religion of crime
stabbed him with the spirit of destiny,

254
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:28,760
resurrecting him as Cain, the biblical first
murderer. As Cain, Savage overpowered the

255
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:34,440
Spectre and separated him from his host before
being stopped by the question. The Spectre

256
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:40,100
branded Savage with the mark of Cain, condemning
him to wander the Earth, reviled, and unable to

257
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:46,700
hide the mark. Savage later manipulated Franny
Montoya into taking the mark from him. You can

258
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:51,620
learn more about the Spectre and the question from
their respective duels against Galactus and

259
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:57,080
Echo. Eventually, Savage became involved with
the surviving faction of his prehistoric tribe,

260
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:02,760
the Insiders, who had also been altered by the
meteor. He formed a temporary alliance with

261
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:08,040
Russell Gull and the Outsiders to prevent the
insiders from claiming more meteorite

262
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:14,220
fragments. When Savage's immortality again
began to fail, he attempted to prolong his life by

263
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:20,920
stealing Alan Scott's DNA using a mutated Sandman
clone, but the scheme collapsed. Savage

264
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,780
ritualistically consumed a clone of himself to
temporarily restore his vitality. In

265
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:33,280
post-Flashpoint continuity, Vandal Savage was
born 47,000 years ago into the Wolf Tribe. He

266
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:39,440
murdered his father after a meteor landed nearby,
which bathed him in transformative radiation,

267
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,540
granting immortality, superhuman strength, and
heightened senses. Members of the Bear Tribe

268
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:50,660
exposed to the same meteor became fellow
immortals forming the Council of Immortals. He

269
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:56,920
waged war against the Han dynasty, served as Sir
Savage in the Crusades, and clashed with Pandora

270
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:03,280
in Antioch. Savage joined the Demon Knights after
the fall of Camelot, fighting alongside Etrican,

271
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:08,140
Madame Zanadu, and the Shining Knights. During
failed attempts to monitor returning meteors

272
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:14,600
predicted by Shang-Hen, he murdered both John and
Copernicus. His activities continued into the

273
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,640
19th century when he carried a plague into Gotham
City using his immune body as a vessel before being

274
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,740
stopped by Jonah Hex. Who you've learned more
about in our last episode, Jonah Hex vs.

275
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:31,340
Deathwarp. He supported Nazi operations during
World War II and attempted to reach a returning

276
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:37,000
meteor via rocket flights. When the pilot
rejected his plan, Savage killed him after the

277
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:43,080
craft crashed. In the modern era, Savage
periodically operated as a serial killer and was

278
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:48,480
imprisoned until freed by the Seeker Society
during the crime syndicate's invasion. He became

279
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,440
involved in multiversal studies with Lionel
Luther and manipulated his immortal children

280
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,500
during an attempt to intercept another meteor.
During this period, he infected Superman with

281
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,840
radiation that hindered his solar absorption.
Savage captured multiple Justice League members

282
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,300
and stole the Fortress of Solitude while
preparing for the Comet's return. When the Comet

283
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:15,620
passed near Earth, Savage absorbed enhanced
power but reverted after Superman dispersed the

284
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:21,420
Comet's energies. Later Savage opposed Lex
Luthor's attempt to wield the Totality and of the

285
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:27,380
few forces capable of ending his immortality and
was killed by a shard of its power. Following the

286
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:32,120
restoration of the multiverse after the final
crisis with the darkest night, Savage was among

287
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:38,320
the many beings returned to life. He later joined a
new organization called the Totality, a

288
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:44,200
multiversal council created to monitor rising
cosmic threats. And that's his history.

289
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:49,500
Powers-wise, Vandal Savage is an immortal
enhanced by tectites or meteor-borne energies

290
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:56,280
that halt aging, regenerate tissue, and grant
superhuman strength, resilience, stamina, and

291
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,760
high-end senses. He could recover from lethal
wounds, survive extreme conditions, and endure

292
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,400
diseases that would kill others. His
intelligence has developed over millennia,

293
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:12,300
making him a master strategist, tactician,
linguist, and combatant. His skill spans ancient

294
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:17,160
and modern weaponry, hand-to-hand combat,
battlefield command, and scientific and

295
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:23,760
political manipulation. His healing has limits,
severe organ damage may require graphs from

296
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:30,020
descendants or clones, and that's Vandal Savage.
But how strong is he though? He's Crow Magnum

297
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:35,680
strong. You could consider him as strong as a
silverback. Okay. And how quick is his healing

298
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,640
factor? Is it like Wolverine deadpool speed or
slower than that? I wouldn't say it's quite as fast

299
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,200
as Wolverine's, which has gotten progressively
faster in the comic books I might add over the

300
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,040
years. Let's say it's inconsistent in the comics.
Like I've seen him literally take an arrow to the

301
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:56,480
head and still keep fighting. Okay, interesting.
You know, his origin reminded me a lot of Ulysses

302
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,440
Bloodstones from the comic books, who is the
father of Elsa Bloodstone. I don't know if you

303
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,520
remember his origin from her duel against
Frankenstein. Vaguely. I'm not sure who came

304
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:11,720
first, but I'm just gonna say that Vandal Savage is
a huge rip-off of Ulysses Bloodstone, and no, I'm

305
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:18,040
not gonna fact check that. Vandal Savage has been
around since 1943, so I feel like that's a bold

306
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:23,340
claim. I stand by what I said. Would you stand by if
you found out that Ulysses Bloodstone first

307
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:29,260
appeared in 1975? Yes, I would. Okay. But enough
about Bloodstone, let me go ahead and tell you all

308
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:35,020
about the X-Men villain Sebastian Shaw.
Sebastian Shaw was born in Pittsburgh,

309
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:40,440
Pennsylvania, where his father Jacob had settled
after fleeing the United Kingdom. Jacob had spent

310
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,120
years working in secret for the geneticist Mr.
Sinister, whose experiments on mutants

311
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:50,360
convinced Jacob that Sinister posed a danger to
his family. You can learn more about Sinister in

312
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:55,380
his duel against the Ultra Humanite. Wanting a
different life for his son, Jacob escaped

313
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:01,580
Sinister's control and tried to raise Sebastian
in America far from that influence. Despite this

314
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:07,380
effort, the two lived in deep poverty, and
Sebastian worked in a steel mill from a young age to

315
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:12,400
help support himself and his father. Despite
their circumstances, Jacob pushed him toward

316
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:17,540
education, and Sebastian excelled
academically. After Jacob's death, Sebastian

317
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:22,400
received a full scholarship to the Stevens
Institute of Technology in New Jersey, but

318
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:27,740
celebrating this achievement led to disaster. A
group of wealthy young men angry that someone from

319
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:33,280
a poor background could attend such a prestigious
school, cornered and beat him. The trauma of this

320
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:38,700
attack triggered his mutant power for the first
time. Sebastian discovered he could absorb the

321
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:44,200
force of physical impacts and convert the energy
into strength, allowing him to overpower his

322
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:50,000
attackers. At college, Sebastian devoted
himself to engineering and business. After

323
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,440
graduating, he quickly became known as a genius
with a remarkable talent for understanding

324
00:30:54,440 --> 00:31:00,200
economics and technology. He founded Shaw
Industries, a company that grew rapidly through

325
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:06,320
defense contracts and munitions development. By
30, he was a millionaire, and by 40, he was a

326
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,120
billionaire. During these years, Shaw also
became romantically involved with a woman named

327
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:17,940
Lorde Chantel, a mutant teleporter, and he began
raising a boy named Shinobi as his own. Shaw's

328
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,920
wealth drew the attention of the Hellfire Club,
which was an elite society of influential

329
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:29,180
business and political leaders. Its public
reputation was one of luxury and exclusivity, but

330
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:34,720
many members belonged to a secret leadership
group called the Inner Circle. Shaw accepted the

331
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,460
invitation to join and soon became the Black
Bishop. His partner Lords distrusted the club,

332
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:46,180
fearing it would corrupt him, but Shaw saw
opportunity and ignored her concerns. Within the

333
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:51,920
Inner Circle, Shaw worked alongside Emma Frost,
Harry Leland, Donald Pierce, and the White King

334
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:57,860
Ned Buckman. The White King had the Hellfire Club
financially support the Sentinel program under

335
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:04,420
the cover of scientific research. In reality, the
Sentinels were anti-mutant robots designed to

336
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:10,520
hunt and kill mutants. You can learn more about
them in our Amazo vs Bastion dual episode. When

337
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:15,440
Shaw discovered the truth about Sentinels, he
confronted Buckman, but the White King betrayed

338
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:22,200
him and sent Sentinels to eliminate Shaw and his
allies. During the attack, Lords died protecting

339
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:28,540
Shaw. Grief stricken and furious, Shaw and Emma
Frost turned on the Inner Circle. Using Emma's

340
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:33,820
telepathy, they forced Buckman to kill the other
members and then himself. Shaw then declared

341
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:40,220
himself the new Black King of the Hellfire Club and
Emma Frost became the new White Queen. You can

342
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:46,080
learn more about Emma Frost in her dual against
Poison Ivy. As Black King, Shaw worked to expand

343
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,360
the club's influence over world politics and
corporations. He used Shaw Industries to build

344
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:57,000
and control Sentinel technology, believing it
was safer for mutants if he held power over the

345
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,840
machines, rather than leaving them in the hands of
anti-mutant forces. Shaw also courted powerful

346
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:08,900
figures like Senator Robert Kelly and Henry Peter
Geirich, pretending to be a human supremacist to

347
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:14,920
allay suspicion while advancing his own plans. He
also attempted to recruit Namor of Atlantis as the

348
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:20,360
Hellfire Club's White King. Namor refused and
Shaw's retaliatory use of Sentinels against

349
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:26,780
Atlantis created a lasting enemy. You can learn
more about Namor in her Aquaman vs Submariner dual

350
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:32,180
episode. Shaw's ambitions soon collided with the
X-Men. Through one of the club's assassins, he

351
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:37,360
planted surveillance devices in Xavier's
mansion, allowing the Hellfire Club to track new

352
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,740
mutants as soon as Cerebro detected them. The club
attempted to recruit or capture new mutants such

353
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:47,900
as Kitty Pryde and Dazzler, leading to direct
confrontation between the Inner Circle and the

354
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:53,340
X-Men. During this conflict, Mastermind
manipulated Jean Grey, not realizing she was

355
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:57,980
actually the Phoenix Force. When Phoenix broke
free of his control, she fought back with

356
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:02,960
devastating power, forcing Shaw and the Inner
Circle to retreat. You can learn more about

357
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:07,860
Professor X and Jean Grey in their respective
duels against the Chief and Raven. The Hellfire

358
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:13,219
Club later fought alongside the X-Men against the
future Sentinel Nimrod. During the battle, Harry

359
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:19,320
Leland used his gravity powers to send Shaw
crashing into Nimrod at incredible speed. The

360
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:25,320
attack destroyed Nimrod, but the exertion killed
Leland, leaving Shaw without an ally in the Inner

361
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:32,080
Circle. Not long after, Magneto joined the club as
the new White King. He, the Black Queen Selene, and

362
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:37,560
Emmafrost the White Queen voted to remove Shaw
from power, citing his reckless support of the

363
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:42,620
Sentinel program. Shaw attempted to rebuild his
influence, but his adopted son, Shinobi,

364
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:48,280
attacked him, phasing a hand into his chest to
induce a heart attack and then blowing up Shaw's

365
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:54,440
chalet. Although presumed dead, Shaw survived
and later resurfaced allied with Holocaust, a

366
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:59,720
destructive mutant from another timeline, to
capture X-Force. However, the plan failed when

367
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,580
Cable freed his team, whom we've learned more
about in our Outsiders vs X-Force duel episode.

368
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:11,140
Shaw next pursued the Elixir Vitae, a substance he
believed could cure the legacy virus, which was a

369
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:16,080
disease that was lethal to mutants, which you can
learn more about in our Beast Boy vs Beast duel

370
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:21,200
episode. Shaw later regained control of the
Hellfire Club and worked to rebuild the Inner

371
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:26,020
Circle by turning the New York branch into a
nightclub for gathering secrets from wealthy

372
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:31,420
patrons. He recruited Miss Sinister, a female
clone of Mr. Sinister, and attempted to

373
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:36,220
manipulate Wolverine's son, Daken. Emma Frost
eventually recovered the memories of her past

374
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:41,920
connection with Namor and blamed Shaw for the
Sentinel strike that had destroyed Atlantis. She

375
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,100
struck a deal with Namor. If she removed Shaw
permanently, Namor would pledge to defend mutant

376
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:53,740
kind as his own people. Emma lured Shaw into a trap,
telepathically incapacitated him, and rather

377
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:58,640
than killing him, secretly transported him to
Utopia, which was the X-Men's island

378
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:04,020
headquarters off the coast of San Francisco.
There, she had him placed in the X-Brick, which was

379
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:09,500
an underwater prison facility that the X-Men used
to confine dangerous mutants. For a time, Shaw

380
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:14,320
remained imprisoned, his whereabouts unknown to
most of the mutant community. Emma eventually

381
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,420
decided that keeping Shaw was too dangerous and
had Shaw released using her telepathy to wipe his

382
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:25,880
memories and leaving him unaware of his identity
or any past crimes. Months later, Shaw was found in

383
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,880
Pakistan and taken to the Avengers Academy where
he was placed in a special cell that absorbed

384
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:36,500
kinetic energy. Shaw escaped by repeatedly
striking himself with a book to build enough power

385
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:41,560
to break free. He eventually regained his
memories and returned to the Hellfire Club. When

386
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:46,940
the Tarigin Clouds released into the atmosphere
by the Inhumans began killing mutants, Shaw

387
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:52,180
allied with Magneto. However, his involvement
with the genetic modification and mutant

388
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:58,080
creating drug called Mother Vine Backfire. After
taking the drug, he gained the ability to absorb

389
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:03,900
ambient kinetic energy, but the unstable
mutation began damaging his cells from within.

390
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:09,240
Emma Frost covertly had his drink poisoned with a
paralytic that prevented him from releasing this

391
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:15,340
energy, causing the overload to kill him. Shaw was
later resurrected on the mutant island of Krakowa

392
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:21,140
and welcomed as part of the New Nation. You can
learn more about Krakowa in its duel against Danny

393
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:27,880
the Street. Shaw earned a seat on the Quiet Council
as the Black King of the Hellfire Trading Company,

394
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,240
which was responsible for the global
distribution of Krakowa medicines. Determined

395
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:38,200
to regain influence, he attempted to install his
resurrected son, Shinobi as the Red King, but Emma

396
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,840
Frost countered him by appointing Kitty Pryde in
that role. Shaw orchestrated Kitty's murder,

397
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:49,020
believing she could not be resurrected, but she
returned after several attempts. When Emma Frost

398
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:53,640
learned the truth by reading the memories of
Kitty's pet dragon, Lockheed, she and Kate

399
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:59,440
brutally punished Shaw, leaving him temporarily
crippled. Shaw eventually recovered, but his

400
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:04,960
power struggles with Krakowa continued until its
eventual downfall. And that's his backstory.

401
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:10,740
Powers-wise, Sebastian Shaw, the Black King, is a
mutant with the ability to absorb kinetic and

402
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:17,600
thermal energy, converting it into superhuman
strength, speed, stamina, and healing ability.

403
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:23,220
Even bladed attacks against him result in only
superficial scratches because of his ability to

404
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:28,420
sap the blade of all its thrusting and cutting
energy. He is a formidable hand-to-hand

405
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:34,440
combatant, a cunning strategist, anti-gifted
engineer and economist. His weakness is that his

406
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:40,240
absorption ability does have a limit, and if he
overloads on energy, he can pass out if he does not

407
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:46,220
exert it. And that's Sebastian Shaw. Okay, so both
of these guys have healing factors and strength,

408
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:50,860
yeah. Although Sebastian Shaw's strength has to
develop, but he can absorb kinetic energy, which

409
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:54,200
is something that Vandal Savage doesn't have. I
don't know how Vandal Savage is gonna hurt him

410
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,800
because punching Shaw is like punching someone in
your dreams, right? Like you punch him as hard as

411
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,280
you can and it's just, it's like hitting good
mattress. Well, this should be a fun speculation.

412
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:14,660
No wonder we haven't used this character yet. Good
luck. In a world where fantasies collide and

426
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:42,600
and abilities out of the way, let's speculate on
how one of the 1,000 simulated matches will go. The

427
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:47,740
winner is determined by simulations, not the
speculation, but it's fun to imagine how this

428
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:54,080
fight could play out. AJ9K, what are the rules of
our speculation? Well, I should say there are no

429
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:59,060
rules other than the characters have no prior
knowledge of the other going into the fight. All

430
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:04,180
they are aware of starting out is that the other
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.

431
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:09,380
For the speculation, the contestants will begin
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript

432
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:14,460
environment that will have no bearing on the match
itself, as no environmental statistics are

433
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:19,740
considered in my simulations. The contestants
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright then

434
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:25,180
let's get into it. Vandal Savage and Sebastian
Shaw meet on the battlefield. Who goes first? I'm

435
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:30,700
going to say that Sebastian Shaw goes first by
kneeling down and punching the ground with his

436
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:37,580
fists as hard as he can in order to build up his
kinetic energy reserve. And since he also spends

437
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:43,160
most of his mornings punching walls or he'll have
his security team beat the shit out of him, we'll

438
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:50,900
see he starts this match off at around 10% peak
power. Okay. So right off the bat he's at least as

439
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:56,220
strong as, you know, a gorilla who can lift like,
what, like two tons? Well, I'm going to say that

440
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:04,360
Savage, you know, he sees Shaw punching the ground
and just from his historical experience, deduces

441
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:10,600
Shaw's ability of kinetic energy storage.
Alright. Okay. And that's when he's going to twist

442
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:18,320
a jewel knob that's atop his walking cane. And
that's going to cause it to emit a blinding flash,

443
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:24,240
which is going to blind Shaw. And when he's done
blinking away the spots from his eyes, Savage is

444
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:30,160
already behind him. And Savage is going to taser
Shaw in the back of the neck with the tip of his cane,

445
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,860
just overloading him with millions of volts of
electrical energy. Millions of volts? Yeah, like

446
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:43,660
way too much for him to absorb. No, no, he's just
going to get a little bit of a boost from the

447
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:48,640
electricity, but he also absorbs thermal energy
in addition to kinetic. So while he's getting

448
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,620
electrocuted, he's slowly going to get stronger
and stronger. And he's going to stop convulsing

449
00:42:53,620 --> 00:43:00,200
and just start laughing. He's going to grab Vendil
Savage's little stick in his hand. And then he's

450
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:06,640
just going to break it in half and proceed to give
Savage a severe caning, just beating him like he

451
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:13,020
owes him money. Okay. But as As soon as Shah grabs
Vandal's cane, Vandal's gonna unsheathe a saber

452
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:19,140
from the handle. So Shah's just broken a sheath
essentially. And while he attempts to beat Vandal

453
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:25,740
with that, Vandal is gonna calmly deflect all of
his attacks, slicing the cane halves up in Shah's

454
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:31,280
hands, and he'll finish off by slitting his throat
as well. Well, I mean, like I said, the blade would

455
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:37,560
only leave a superficial scratch across Shah's
neck because his skin would sap the saber of all of

456
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:43,880
its kinetic energy as it made contact. So again,
all you're doing is powering up Shah. At this

457
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:49,340
point, he's probably like at 25% power because of
the electrical attack. So he's just gonna stomp

458
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:53,800
toward Vandal Savage, you know, keeping his
opponent on the back foot. He's gonna straight up

459
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:59,580
smack the sword out of his hand and then grab Vandal
Savage, lift him up in the air and just power bomb

460
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:05,320
him onto the ground right onto his head, which
causes Vandal Savage's neck to break. I mean,

461
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:09,640
Savage, his bones are pretty thick and durable.
Like, I don't think it would paralyze him or

462
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:16,100
anything, plus he'd heal right away. And to give
him the chance to do so as he's on the ground, he's

463
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:21,400
going to pull out a pen that he kept in his pocket.
And that's a sonic emitter. So while Shah is

464
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:26,660
covering his ears with his hands like, oh no, my
freaking ears. That's when Savage is gonna

465
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:34,540
straight up shove that pen up Shah's nose and
unleash the acid ink within it, just dissolving

466
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:39,840
Shah's head from the inside. What the fuck? How
many gadgets does Vandal Savage have? He's like

467
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:44,760
fucking James Bond or something? What's going on
here? Yeah, he's like the ultimate James Bond in a

468
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:51,300
way. Stop making shit up. Dude, I'm not. He
literally invents all kinds of stuff. He invented

469
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:58,920
the knife. He invented fire. Like he's always
prepared with some kind of gadget. Whatever.

470
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:05,820
Okay, the sonic pen would hurt Shah's ears, yes,
but the sonic vibrations from it once again would

471
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:13,720
power him up. So when Vandal Savage goes to stab him
up the nose with the pen, Shah just grabs him by the

472
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:19,500
wrist and straight up rips his whole damn arm off.
Okay, I mean, that's fine. Savage has probably

473
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:25,600
lost that same arm several times throughout his
life. He'll just regrow another one later. But I

474
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:31,480
will say that some of that acid from the pen did
manage to land on Shah's chest and it's slowly

475
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:38,060
eating its way through it. So Shah's freaking out.
And while he is, Savage is going to remove his belt

476
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:45,100
and Garrett, Shah from behind with it, strangling
him to death with his one arm. For some reason, when

477
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:49,180
you said Savage removed his belt, I thought you
were going to say he's going to give Shah an ass

478
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:57,200
whooping. That would have been awkward. Anyway,
Shah can't absorb acid. It would hurt him and he can

479
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,220
also be suffocated. But like I'm saying, he's so
strong by this point as Savage is trying to

480
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:07,180
strangle him, Shah would just grab the belt around
his neck and rip it in half. And then he takes that

481
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:13,480
belt and does give Vandal Savage an ass whooping
before straight up ripping his spine out of his

482
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:18,720
body. Match over. But dude, how is he going to do
that with the acid still eating at his chest? Like

483
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:24,440
by this point, his organs are exposed. That was
really strong acid. It was just a little splash

484
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:31,220
that got on him of acid. He'll be fine. I mean, did I
also mention that Savage's saber blade from his

485
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:37,840
cane was laced with poison? Because it was. So that
poison entered the superficial cut in his neck and

486
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:43,620
has been slowly sapping away Shah's strength this
whole time. So after Shah rips the belt, he just

487
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:50,520
pukes and dies. Well, yeah, poison changes
things. I'm going to say that, you know, Savage's

488
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:56,920
poison barely got in Shah's system. It didn't
really affect him in enough time to prevent Vandal

489
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,760
Savage's ass whooping and getting his spine
ripped out. There you go. OK, so it was just a little

490
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:06,820
poison that affected him a little bit of acid.
Yeah. Come on. Shah's just too strong. I don't know

491
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:11,940
what to tell you. But we could go ahead and leave the
match there. Either Sebastian Shah gets poisoned

492
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:18,400
early in the match by a poison laced blade and
therefore succumbs to it and dies. Or the poison

493
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,920
doesn't affect him that much because he doesn't
get enough in his system and he rips Vandal

494
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:27,280
Savage's spine from his body. Let's go ahead and
input the character stats from the simulations

495
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:32,580
and find out which of these scenarios is more
likely to happen when we come back with a winner.

496
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:39,200
AJ9K, hit it. Inputting data, running
calculations, processing results, simulations

497
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:45,660
complete. I actually really like this matchup.
Like I was intrigued by it when it was pitched, but

498
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:50,720
having gone through it, Vandal Savage had more
going for him than I thought he would against

499
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,800
Sebastian Shah. Yeah, I thought this was going to
be an easy win for Sebastian Shah, considering

500
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,220
that he's actually super powered. Well, I mean,
Vandal Savage is actually super powered too, but

501
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:05,700
not to the full potential that Sebastian Shah can
reach. So I was going in this fairly confident and

502
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:11,000
then just statistically Vandal Savage is pretty
impressive. So I'm less confident now. We'll say

503
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,040
that. I think this will be a closer match than I ever
wanted it to be. Well, I mean, from a stat

504
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:23,140
perspective, Sebastian Shah has the capability
of being much more of a physical powerhouse than

505
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:29,640
Vandal Savage. When it came to stats like speed,
durability, strength and even damage, the edge

506
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:35,180
went to Shaw. But on the other side of the spectrum,
we found that Vandal Savage was a better fighter.

507
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:40,280
He had slightly more range just because of the
gadgets he carries. He's smarter. He's more

508
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:45,940
perceptive since he has enhanced senses and
overall just a bit more versatile. I don't think he

509
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:51,080
should come into this match with any gadgets. I was
never told that he would have gadgets. Tell that to

510
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:57,200
all of the superheroes he goes up against who don't
expect him to pull out gadgets. I have receipts,

511
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:02,420
sir. I have receipts. All right, whatever. So
considering all of the stats that were run, who do

512
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:06,300
you think is going to come out on top? I still think
it's going to be Sebastian Shah, but I think it's

513
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:12,060
going to be really close, basically a coin toss.
And really, this should have been a curb stop on

514
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:17,380
behalf of Sebastian Shah, but it's going to end up
being probably a coin toss. Although, you know

515
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:22,140
what? Instagram disagrees with me. So maybe
people out there know something I don't because

516
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:29,200
68% of our poll takers on Instagram sided with
Vandal Savage over Sebastian Shah. I think Vandal

517
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:34,400
Savage just has a cooler look to him. Like he
actually pulls off that Victorian era look,

518
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:38,520
whereas Sebastian Shah does not. What are you
talking about? You don't have any clue what you're

519
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:43,620
talking about. The fact that Vandal Savage won the
poll does scare me, though, because I would have

520
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:47,640
thought that Sebastian Shah would have won the
popularity contest, at least considering that he

521
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:53,000
was played by Kevin Bacon in one of the greatest
sexman films that has been made. Well, let's find

522
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:59,680
out who won the match. AJ9K, the results, please.
Here you are, sir. The winner of the matchup

523
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:11,420
between Vandal Savage and Sebastian Shah is
Vandal Savage, baby. What? He won 593 of the 1000

524
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:20,220
simulated matches or 59.3% of the time compared to
Sebastian Shah who only won 40.7%. So that wasn't

525
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:26,880
even a coin toss. No, Vandal Savage won handedly,
which would have been surprising to me prior to us

526
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:32,180
doing the stats. And I don't even think I mentioned
we accounted for Sebastian Shah being at his

527
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:38,540
strongest in these stats. The power level he's not
always at. I was supposed to win this entire month

528
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:44,460
of November. And were you? Yeah, I was supposed to.
Well, it looks like that didn't happen. Did it?

529
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,880
Universe owes me for not coming through on this for
sure. Universe doesn't owe you shit. You know

530
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:55,020
what? I'm thankful for this Thanksgiving. Having
an awesome twin brother. What? Yeah. No. I'm

531
00:50:55,020 --> 00:51:00,680
thankful for this win in particular because DC has
been on a losing streak and I was getting scared.

532
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:05,340
Well, I'll be thankful that at least you were
scared at some point this month. Sure, I'll let you

533
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:41,810
have it. But that does it for this duel. A.G. and
N.K. help close this out. In our next episode, we

534
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:49,320
are doing a team duel between the powerhouse teams
of the new gods against the Eternals. Look forward

535
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:53,560
to that next week. That does it for this episode. We
want to give a big thanks to our executive

536
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:58,460
producers, John Staroski, Zachary Hepburn,
Destin Belcom, Nathaniel Wagner, Levi Yatyn,

Scott Camacho, Gil Camacho, Adam Spees, Dean

538
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:09,740

Graves for helping make this podcast possible.

539
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:15,440
We'll talk to you guys next week. Up, up and away.
True believers. The Amalgam version of these two

540
00:52:15,440 --> 
characters would be named Sandal Bandage and they
would repair shoes as their day job.
