1
00:00:03,283 --> 00:00:03,344
you

2
00:00:23,534 --> 00:00:28,277
Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we
review superhero films and debate the superiority

3
00:00:28,317 --> 00:00:33,462
between Marvel and DC by comparing their characters
in stat-based battle simulations. I'm Johnny

4
00:00:33,502 --> 00:00:40,087
DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous Joe.
And welcome to the 2021 holiday animal battle,

5
00:00:40,388 --> 00:00:45,792
that sounds weird, charity episode. Yeah, every
year around Giving Tuesday, which is today,

6
00:00:46,092 --> 00:00:52,177
Jonathan and I like to host a charity duel between
two of the more whimsical Marvel and DC characters.

7
00:00:52,626 --> 00:00:57,448
This episode, we're going to find out who would
win in a fight between Gleek and Hitmonkey.

8
00:00:57,768 --> 00:01:01,831
They're both monkey characters for their respective
universes, and we think it'll be pretty funny

9
00:01:01,851 --> 00:01:06,113
considering, you know, monkeys are just hilarious.
Yeah, especially little tiny monkeys like these

10
00:01:06,153 --> 00:01:12,677
guys. You know what's not hilarious though?
COVID-19. Which I have right now recovering

11
00:01:12,717 --> 00:01:18,900
from. So if it sounds like I'm out of breath,
it's because I am. And if it sounds echoey,

12
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:24,335
it's because I'm in my quarantine space recording.
So apologies for the audio this time. Yeah,

13
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:29,039
I mean, I told Jonathan that we could skip this
week, but he was willing to push forward and

14
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:34,182
keep our record of never missing an episode
of this podcast going on six years now. Yeah,

15
00:01:34,242 --> 00:01:39,626
I mean, I don't feel terrible. I do encourage
anyone who can get vaccinated to get vaccinated.

16
00:01:39,686 --> 00:01:43,269
I think that's really helped me. So yeah, I
didn't want to miss this episode, especially

17
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:46,632
this one, because this one's gonna be fun. Yeah,
I can't wait to get into it before we go into

18
00:01:46,652 --> 00:01:51,070
the histories and backstories of Gleek and Hitmonkey.
we're gonna go over the comic book movie news

19
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,692
from the past week, of which there was just
one news item, and that's the DC League of

20
00:01:55,772 --> 00:02:00,094
Super Pets official trailer. So we'll talk about
that, then get into the duel. As always, we

21
00:02:00,134 --> 00:02:04,096
list our segment times and our episode description,
so feel free to check out the show notes if

22
00:02:04,116 --> 00:02:08,117
you wanna skip ahead to a particular topic.
And guys, if you listened to one of our charity

23
00:02:08,157 --> 00:02:12,359
duel episodes before, you know that every year
we give to a different organization. For the

24
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:16,521
past couple of years, we've given to Pop Culture
Classroom, but this year, in light of COVID,

25
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:21,148
we're switching it up a bit. What we're going
to do is raise money for the HealthWell Foundation,

26
00:02:21,308 --> 00:02:26,953
which is a leading nonprofit dedicated to improving
access to care for America's underinsured.

27
00:02:27,033 --> 00:02:30,817
If you're listening to us from outside of the
US, you probably don't get this, but we have

28
00:02:30,837 --> 00:02:35,641
a shitty healthcare system and some people can't
afford to pay for the healthcare services they

29
00:02:35,681 --> 00:02:40,124
receive, especially during these trying times.
So with this organization, when health insurance

30
00:02:40,164 --> 00:02:45,489
is not enough, they fill the gap by assisting
with copays, premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket

31
00:02:45,529 --> 00:02:50,303
expenses. through their crowd-sourced disease-related
funds. What this podcast is gonna do is set

32
00:02:50,343 --> 00:02:54,844
up a Facebook fundraiser. So if you guys aren't
following us on Facebook, go ahead and search

33
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:59,425
for Dynamic Duel DC versus Marvel, and you can
find the fundraiser there. Go ahead and donate

34
00:02:59,605 --> 00:03:04,927
any amount between today, giving Tuesday, and
Christmas Day. And at the end of December,

35
00:03:04,987 --> 00:03:11,489
Jonathan and I will pick two random donors to
award a free Dynamic Duel card game to. Jonathan

36
00:03:11,529 --> 00:03:15,871
and I have made a couple of card games. that
are Marvel and DC based, and we wanna give

37
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:20,795
it to two of you donors. So if you feel so inclined
to this Giving Tuesday, again, visit this podcast's

38
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:27,080
Facebook page and donate to the HealthWell Foundation
using that pinned post. And because we want

39
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,444
you guys so badly to donate to this organization,
we are currently making all of our archived

40
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:37,627
episodes available to the listening public.
Instead of subscribing to our show, we want

41
00:03:37,647 --> 00:03:42,346
you guys to instead put that money toward our
fundraiser. And it doesn't matter what amount

42
00:03:42,366 --> 00:03:47,147
you donate, anything helps. But during this
giving season, we appreciate any amount of

43
00:03:47,187 --> 00:03:51,688
giving. So those of you who are currently subscribed
to this show on Spotify, I don't believe you'll

44
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:56,010
get charged for the month of December. And those
who are currently subscribed to us on Patreon,

45
00:03:56,370 --> 00:04:01,051
you'll still get access to all of your standard
bonus perks, including the bonus episodes,

46
00:04:01,371 --> 00:04:05,692
access to our Discord server, blooper reels,
and more. I just wanna give a quick special

47
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:11,026
shout out to one of our patrons, Dustin Balcom,
when he found out that I had COVID. His family

48
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:16,909
sent my family a couple of pizzas, which was
just awesome. My family and I are super grateful

49
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:20,711
for the act of generosity. We really appreciate
it, and I just wanted to give you a shout out

50
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:27,675
and say thank you very much. But with that out
of the way, quick to the No Prize. A No Prize

51
00:04:27,695 --> 00:04:32,297
is an award Marvel used to give out up until
the 90s to fans. Our version, the dynamic dual

52
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:37,380
No Prize, is a digital award we post on social
media that Jonathan personally draws for those

53
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,074
who we feel gave the best answer to our question
of the week. Last week's question was in regards

54
00:04:42,134 --> 00:04:47,475
to the Spider-Man No Way Home trailer that we
got a few weeks ago. We asked you guys who

55
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:52,837
has been your favorite live action Spider-Man
villain and why. We got a few great answers

56
00:04:52,877 --> 00:04:56,958
for this. Let's go ahead and run down our honorable
mentions as well as the no prize winner. Our

57
00:04:57,058 --> 00:05:03,640
first honorable mention goes to Jacob Bell who
said, Hey guys, this is Jacob Bell. My favorite

58
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,514
live action Spider-Man villain has got to be
the vulture. I think Michael Keaton. plays

59
00:05:09,614 --> 00:05:15,357
a great villain and I honestly think that the
Vulture and his motivations are probably the

60
00:05:15,417 --> 00:05:21,421
best just because, I mean, you can really almost
get on board with what he's doing and also

61
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:27,865
the twist with him being Liz's dad was just
incredible and so I love Michael Keaton as

62
00:05:27,905 --> 00:05:31,708
the Vulture, that's my favorite. And yeah, I
would have to agree. I'd say the Vulture is

63
00:05:31,788 --> 00:05:36,823
probably one of the MCU's like top three villains.
Yeah, while most Spider-Man villains are seeking

64
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:41,386
power, the vulture in Spider-Man Homecoming
was really motivated by survival and providing

65
00:05:41,406 --> 00:05:45,809
for his family. Of course, it got a little bit
out of hand and he needed to be stopped, but

66
00:05:45,829 --> 00:05:50,672
it was really easy to identify with the character.
And Michael Keaton just gave great performance.

67
00:05:51,173 --> 00:05:55,896
Yeah, the way they adapted his costume from
the comics too, like, mwah, chef's kiss, so

68
00:05:55,916 --> 00:06:00,079
well done. Oh yeah, movie version of the vulture
was a huge improvement over the comic book

69
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:04,722
version. Although we'll be getting to a vulture
duel before long on this podcast. Our next

70
00:06:04,762 --> 00:06:12,805
honorable mention goes to Benjamin Alves, who
said, Hi guys, I think Alfred Molina as Doc

71
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:20,328
Ock was the best Spider-Man villain. He's such
a great actor. I love all his movies. And I

72
00:06:20,428 --> 00:06:26,851
love the part where he was with Otme on the
building. So menacing. It was awesome. I think,

73
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:35,230
and it's just, there's no other word to describe
it. Bye. Great answer, Benjamin. Yeah, Doctor

74
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,771
Octopus is definitely one of Spider-Man's best
villains to ever appear in live action. We

75
00:06:39,811 --> 00:06:44,132
all know that Spider-Man 2 is one of the best
Spider-Man movies ever made, mainly because

76
00:06:44,352 --> 00:06:49,194
of how great Doc Ock was in that film. Alfred
Molina just knocked it out of the park. He

77
00:06:49,294 --> 00:06:53,275
also created a Spider-Man villain that we could
sympathize with. And there's no discounting

78
00:06:53,335 --> 00:06:57,516
the design of those tentacles, right? Those
were badass looking. Oh, man. Yeah, those were

79
00:06:57,596 --> 00:07:02,557
really well designed. It's no surprise that
Doctor Octopus is many people's favorite Spider-Man

80
00:07:02,577 --> 00:07:06,756
villain. Yeah, and one of the reasons why he's
playing such a big role in Spider-Man No Way

81
00:07:06,796 --> 00:07:12,820
Home allegedly. Our final honorable mention
goes to Marquis High, who said, Hello gentlemen,

82
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:20,225
so Marquis High here. Just give me a call. I'd
say for the villain, must off-top go with Michael

83
00:07:20,265 --> 00:07:25,269
Keaton. Always just a great actor, even if he
doesn't really know too much about the characters

84
00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:31,533
that he's acting. But besides that, I definitely
would have to go with Doc Ock. He's always

85
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:38,264
just... had more of a human aspect, very relatable.
And the fact that he turns into a potential

86
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:44,527
hero is something big. Marquis has a great radio
voice, doesn't he? Yeah, he does. Yeah, but

87
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:48,049
great answer. This is kind of a combination
of the previous two where he mentioned both

88
00:07:48,169 --> 00:07:53,792
Vulture and Doctor Octopus. I think those two
guys are widely regarded among the Spider-Man

89
00:07:53,812 --> 00:07:58,814
fan community as the best villains to appear
in these movies. Hopefully. We get to see them

90
00:07:58,874 --> 00:08:04,416
team up in the upcoming Spider-Man No Way Home
movie, but we don't know yet what kind of role

91
00:08:04,476 --> 00:08:08,798
Vulture will play in that film. We want to give
a quick shout out to Evan Tompke for visiting

92
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:15,121
our website to record an answer, but the winner
of this week's No Prize is Miggy Mathengian

93
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:19,723
who said, Hey guys, this is Miggy and my favorite
live action Spider-Man villain is Green Goblin.

94
00:08:20,203 --> 00:08:23,745
In my opinion, it's best when the villain makes
it personal. And he definitely did that when

95
00:08:23,785 --> 00:08:28,642
he attacked his aunt and girlfriend. He also
endangered a lot of innocent lives, like when

96
00:08:28,662 --> 00:08:32,643
he attacked the Macy's Day Parade and dropped
those kids off the Washington Bridge and attacked

97
00:08:32,663 --> 00:08:38,325
the Daily Bugle. And he continued to ruin Peter's
life by deteriorating his relationship with

98
00:08:38,365 --> 00:08:43,506
Harry even after his death. More so than any
other Spider-Man villain, I would say that

99
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:48,528
Green Goblin has a knack for making it personal,
not just in the movies, but also the comics.

100
00:08:49,088 --> 00:08:53,889
Oh yeah, he makes Peter Parker's life a living
hell. I really like the way they exemplified

101
00:08:53,929 --> 00:08:59,576
that in these movies. Like Miggy said, even
affecting Peter Parker after his death. When

102
00:08:59,596 --> 00:09:05,139
you have a villain that not only attacks the
hero's grandma, but also drops a bunch of kids

103
00:09:05,219 --> 00:09:09,202
in a cable car off a bridge, you know you're
dealing with some hardcore shit. Yeah, he's

104
00:09:09,222 --> 00:09:16,006
like borderline Joker, right? Yeah, if like
the Joker were way better and on Marvel. Just

105
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:20,448
like that, for sure. He's a villain that's so
good they included him twice in both Spider-Man

106
00:09:20,689 --> 00:09:25,827
and The Amazing Spider-Man 2. But I'm really
looking forward to Willem Dafoe's return as

107
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:30,189
the character in the upcoming No Way Home film.
So congrats again to Mickey, Matt, and Keon

108
00:09:30,209 --> 00:09:33,950
for winning this week's No Prize. If you, the
listener, want a shot at winning your own No

109
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,552
Prize, stay tuned to later on this episode when
we'll be asking another Question of the Week.

110
00:09:39,052 --> 00:09:41,273
And now that that's done, onto the news!

111
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:51,743
Okay, so last week we got our first official
trailer of the DC League of Super Pets film.

112
00:09:52,363 --> 00:09:57,745
And I gotta say it's different from what I thought
it was going to be. I was hoping it was going

113
00:09:57,765 --> 00:10:03,446
to be based on the children's book series DC
Super Pets that is pretty faithful to the comic

114
00:10:03,466 --> 00:10:08,968
books. This movie however is not. Yeah, it seems
like it's not about a super team of pets of

115
00:10:09,008 --> 00:10:13,769
the main DC superheroes. It looks like it's
a film about these shelter animals that happen

116
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:18,583
to get powers. So it seems like this isn't like
Ace the Bat Hound or the terrific What's It,

117
00:10:18,944 --> 00:10:23,646
they're entirely original characters. Well,
I mean, Kevin Hart's character is named Ace

118
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:28,289
in the movie, who's not supposed to have any
powers, looks like he has invulnerability.

119
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:33,511
They have Chip the Squirrel, but he doesn't
have Green Lantern powers, he has electricity

120
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:38,294
powers apparently. The Turtle is the only one
that makes sense, because the Turtle's apparently

121
00:10:38,374 --> 00:10:42,896
named Merton, you know, Merton McSnurdle, the
Turtle. You know, we talked about him in our

122
00:10:42,957 --> 00:10:47,632
What's It versus Spider-Man episode, Still one
of my favorite episodes. I love that guy. But

123
00:10:47,672 --> 00:10:53,996
in the movie he's called Shell on Wheels. Yeah,
I guess the pig whose name is PB for pot belly.

124
00:10:54,317 --> 00:10:58,460
It doesn't even look like it's Wonder Woman's
pet. Just gives the characters like random

125
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:03,304
names. I don't think those will stick. Do you
think by the end of this movie each of these

126
00:11:03,324 --> 00:11:07,767
shelter pets will be adopted by the Justice
League? I hope so, honestly. You know, I think

127
00:11:07,807 --> 00:11:12,042
the turtle should be adopted by the Flash. You
know, the pig by Wonder Woman. Chip becomes

128
00:11:12,142 --> 00:11:17,544
a Green Lantern. And we get to see Wonder Woman,
Green Lantern, Cyborg, Batman in this trailer,

129
00:11:17,564 --> 00:11:21,726
which was a huge surprise. They have different
costumes. Not really in love with the designs

130
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:26,228
here, but that's fine. I imagine we won't be
seeing too much of them. I like the designs

131
00:11:26,248 --> 00:11:30,930
of the DC characters. You know, they're very
like Incredibles-esque. It was cool to hear

132
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:35,412
John Krasinski as Superman. Yeah, I think he
sounds pretty good as the character. What did

133
00:11:35,432 --> 00:11:40,314
you think of the rocks depiction of Krypto?
It was fine, it was fine. As was Kevin Hart

134
00:11:40,354 --> 00:11:46,239
as Ace and Vanessa Bayer as PB. Diego Luna,
I guess, does the voice for Chip, which this

135
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:51,263
trailer revealed. Mark Maron, apparently, is
the voice of Lex Luthor in this film. Oh, interesting.

136
00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:56,067
Yeah. The same guy that was in the Joker movie
and who also like was dissing comic book films?

137
00:11:56,468 --> 00:12:02,352
Yes. Okay. He just likes DC. What can I say?
But there's a few more cast members that we

138
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:06,896
still don't know what role they're going to
play, like Kate McKinnon, Keanu Reeves, Ben

139
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:11,291
Schwartz and Jamila Jamil. Maybe there's gonna
be like other members of the Justice League

140
00:12:11,311 --> 00:12:16,194
we don't know yet. Maybe one of them is gonna
be the cat, Streaky, who has a very different

141
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:22,737
superpower in this movie. That was weird. Yeah,
the tail like shoots out rockets and flames

142
00:12:22,777 --> 00:12:27,560
and stuff. I was like, what? It can't be Streaky.
I'm not sure I'm loving like the random power

143
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,882
assignment that a lot of these guys have. Me
neither. But you know, it's a movie for kids.

144
00:12:32,022 --> 00:12:36,685
It's supposed to be as whimsical as possible.
I think that also explains the jokes, which

145
00:12:36,825 --> 00:12:41,007
I'm also not in love with. A lot of them didn't
really land for me. I think felt like the timing

146
00:12:41,047 --> 00:12:46,251
was off. Like when Crypto was talking to that
other dog about like the federation of exes,

147
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:52,815
the dog was like, why it's taking my owner so
long? I was like, okay. Yeah, that was horrible

148
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:57,478
delivery. Yeah. It was a little bit too slow.
Also the joke about like, they should call

149
00:12:57,498 --> 00:13:04,042
me Iron Man. Nah. Dude, what is up with DC animation's
obsession with Iron Man? Like you get the Iron

150
00:13:04,062 --> 00:13:09,163
Man reference in this movie and in Lego Batman
you had the reference with Batman's Batcave

151
00:13:09,203 --> 00:13:15,205
password. Iron Man sucks, what can I say? They're
just jealous as hell. They're just jealous.

152
00:13:15,225 --> 00:13:19,886
There was also another Marvel reference in this
when Krypto was basically saying with great

153
00:13:19,906 --> 00:13:25,148
power comes great responsibility. Wait, what?
He says when one has an abundance of power,

154
00:13:25,428 --> 00:13:30,869
they have a certain duty to use that power.
Exactly. Same thing. Sure. Yeah. I don't know.

155
00:13:32,574 --> 00:13:36,538
I can't quite say I'm looking forward to this
movie just yet. Well, I'm guessing this is

156
00:13:36,558 --> 00:13:40,261
going to be an origin story where we see these
characters evolve into the team you know and

157
00:13:40,301 --> 00:13:44,826
love, just maybe with different powers. Maybe.
Maybe I need another trailer or two, which

158
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:49,591
we'll probably get. The movie doesn't come out
until May of next year, so we have some time.

159
00:13:50,031 --> 00:13:51,713
But this all brings us to our question of the
week.

160
00:13:56,302 --> 00:14:01,904
Who is your favorite DC or Marvel animal hero
and why? There's a lot of them to choose from,

161
00:14:02,064 --> 00:14:06,966
both on DC and Marvel, but let us know which
one you like the most. Yeah, record your answer

prize that we'll post to social media. Be sure

166
00:14:25,594 --> 00:14:30,096
to answer before December 4th. But I think that
does it for all the news for this episode,

167
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:36,578
so let's go ahead and hear from our sponsor,
HBO Max. Bruce Wayne may appear to be a wealthy

168
00:14:36,598 --> 00:14:42,581

Thanks to HBO Max for sponsoring this episode.

178
00:15:40,378 --> 00:15:43,806
But now let's get into the main event of this
episode where we find out who would win in

179
00:15:43,846 --> 00:15:49,137
a fight between the Wonder Twins' pet monkey,
Gleek, and Deadpool's rival, Pit Monkey.

180
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:10,010
Okay, Gleek versus Hitmonkey. This matchup was
actually a fairly last minute decision. You

181
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:16,235
could tell because this year we didn't commission
an artist to do artwork for this episode because

182
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:21,840
it was so last minute. Yeah, but we were inspired
by one of our patrons on our Discord who asked

183
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:27,145
us who would be good in a matchup against Hitmonkey
since that character now has his own television

184
00:16:27,165 --> 00:16:31,388
show currently on Hulu, which is actually pretty
good. I've been watching it. Yeah, they both

185
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:34,615
have their own cartoons. It's pretty awesome.
And Jonathan and I have been trying to get

186
00:16:34,695 --> 00:16:38,518
Gleek in a matchup for the longest time. We
thought he might be good in a fight against

187
00:16:38,658 --> 00:16:43,242
Spider Ham, but eventually we went with the
terrific What's It for that matchup. I think

188
00:16:43,262 --> 00:16:48,547
when you have an alien monkey who can stretch
his tail infinitely long against a monkey who's

189
00:16:48,587 --> 00:16:52,750
really good with guns, you have a pretty solid
matchup there, right? Yeah. I have no idea

190
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,513
who's going to come out on top. I just know
it's going to be fun. Again, this is our charity

191
00:16:56,553 --> 00:17:01,698
matchup as we do every year. So if you feel
inclined to give this holiday season, Again,

Foundation, which is a nonprofit dedicated

to helping America pay their health bills. So
let's get into it. If you've never listened

194
00:17:10,503 --> 00:17:14,725
to one of our dual episodes before, the way
we determine a winner between these two characters

195
00:17:15,045 --> 00:17:21,168
is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations using
their statistics. Now a Monte Carlo simulation

196
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:27,292
is a probabilistic model used to determine outcomes
through random sampling. In our case, it randomizes

197
00:17:27,332 --> 00:17:31,950
statistics along a normal distribution, which
is a bell curve. as a way to simulate the many

198
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:36,671
variables that can occur during battle. The
stat parameters we use are based on the official

199
00:17:36,691 --> 00:17:41,853
Marvel power grid, and we use that criteria
to extrapolate the DC character's stats. We've

200
00:17:41,873 --> 00:17:47,334
included some additional stat categories of
our own, such as range, damage potential, versatility,

201
00:17:47,394 --> 00:17:53,516
and perception, in order to create a more complete
and robust simulation. Running these 1000 simulations

202
00:17:53,576 --> 00:17:58,537
gives us a percentage of wins for each character,
and we declare the one with the higher percentage

203
00:17:58,597 --> 00:18:03,143
to be the ultimate victor. considering that
they're more likely to win any given battle.

204
00:18:03,623 --> 00:18:08,745
No character ever wins 100% of the time. Comics
have shown that there's always a way for Batman

205
00:18:08,765 --> 00:18:13,267
to defeat Superman. We feel our method falls
in line with the precedents that have been

206
00:18:13,307 --> 00:18:18,389
established in the comic book stories. And we
use this method because it was the least subjective,

207
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:23,311
most unbiased way to determine who would win.
Of course, we are both heavily biased toward

208
00:18:23,331 --> 00:18:27,893
our respective allegiances, so instead of debating
these matches forever, we just let the math

209
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:33,773
decide for us. So there's no fan votes here
and no relying on just feats. Before we run

210
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:38,516
these simulations though, we like to break down
each character's histories and abilities before

211
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:43,860
improvising a scenario on how we imagine one
of the 1,000 simulations we run would play

212
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,763
out beat for beat. And I think it's my turn
to go first with the Marvel character, so let

213
00:18:48,783 --> 00:18:54,167
me go ahead and tell you all about the comic
book backstory of Hitmonkey. So much is steeped

214
00:18:54,227 --> 00:18:59,786
in legend surrounding the origins of the assassin
known as Hitmonkey. The tale regarding this

215
00:18:59,846 --> 00:19:05,329
mysterious killer of killers is said to begin
in the snowy mountains of Japan, where an unnamed

216
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:11,593
assassin fled after being double-crossed in
a failed political coup. In the freezing wilderness,

217
00:19:11,793 --> 00:19:17,557
the lost and injured man was discovered by a
group of Japanese macaques. The primates took

218
00:19:17,597 --> 00:19:22,139
the assassin to their hot springs and nursed
him back to health with their herbal remedies.

219
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:27,550
Though the macaques were willing to accept the
man into their monkey clan, One skeptical monkey

220
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:33,151
didn't trust the outsider and watched him closely.
This monkey observed as the assassin healed

221
00:19:33,191 --> 00:19:38,073
from his wounds and prepared for revenge against
those who betrayed him by honing his skills

222
00:19:38,193 --> 00:19:43,014
in the snowy mountains. The monkey watched and
learned as the man demonstrated his various

223
00:19:43,114 --> 00:19:48,656
lethal maneuvers in hand-to-hand and weapons
combat. And he watched how easy killing was

224
00:19:48,736 --> 00:19:54,297
for the outsider. The monkey tried to warn his
clan that harboring the assassin was only going

225
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:58,748
to bring more violence their way. When the clan
rejected this notion, the monkey accidentally

226
00:19:58,968 --> 00:20:03,271
injured one of his fellow primates during his
effort to convince them of the oncoming danger.

227
00:20:03,772 --> 00:20:08,816
This monkey was cast out of his clan and into
the wilderness on his own. Several days into

228
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:13,720
his exile, he noticed a group of soldiers headed
up the mountains toward his former home, and

229
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:19,064
he rushed back to the hot springs to warn his
fellow primates. The monkey was too late, however,

230
00:20:19,304 --> 00:20:24,148
as he arrived only in time to witness the soldiers
gun down the assassin and all of his macaque

231
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:29,956
family. The Monkey picked up the weapons of
the Assassin and used the skills he learned

232
00:20:30,016 --> 00:20:35,399
from observing him to shoot and kill the soldiers
there that murdered his clan. At that moment,

233
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:41,222
he became Hitmonkey. The spirit of the Outsider
Assassin appeared before Hitmonkey and told

234
00:20:41,262 --> 00:20:46,225
him how the soldiers were sent by a politician
named Hideki Hayashi, who in turn worked for

235
00:20:46,365 --> 00:20:51,508
General Kato. The spirit told Hitmonkey that
by killing these men, he would achieve vengeance

236
00:20:51,548 --> 00:20:56,546
not only for his dead Monkey brethren, but also
for the Assassin himself. Hitmonkey traveled

237
00:20:56,586 --> 00:21:01,729
to Tokyo and, under the assassin's guidance,
stole a truck and crashed it into Hayashi's

238
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:06,772
limo. Barely clinging to life, the politician
was sent to the hospital where he was smothered

239
00:21:06,852 --> 00:21:12,515
by the assassin Bullseye, who was hired by General
Kato to cover his tracks. The following day,

240
00:21:12,635 --> 00:21:17,697
Hitmonkey snuck into General Kato's daughter's
wedding and stole the suit from the child ring

241
00:21:17,737 --> 00:21:22,800
bearer, pretending to be part of the ceremony
to get in close. He managed to decapitate General

242
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:28,000
Kato despite Bullseye's efforts to stop causing
Bullseye to kill the rest of Kato's men to

243
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:34,085
avoid the humiliation of being bested by a primate.
Bullseye found and hurled a knife at Hitmonkey,

244
00:21:34,365 --> 00:21:38,709
though the blade was intercepted by the ring
bearer child, who annoyingly stepped in the

245
00:21:38,749 --> 00:21:44,474
way. From then on, Hitmonkey, having achieved
his own vengeance, vowed to seek revenge for

246
00:21:44,494 --> 00:21:49,938
those innocents whose blood had been spilled,
and he became a killer of killers. He fell

247
00:21:49,978 --> 00:21:55,500
into urban legend, believed only by the very
few who had ever seen him in action, and disregarded

248
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:01,843
as a joke by everyone else. Spider-Man was one
such non-believer who refused to buy Deadpool's

249
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:06,845
story about the legendary hit monkey who was
targeting him. Spider-Man then witnessed the

250
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:12,108
merciless primate bust in, and like a furry
blur, filled Deadpool full of lead. What? To

251
00:22:12,148 --> 00:22:17,170
get back at the monkey, Deadpool stole Spider-Man's
spare costume, and pretended that Spider-Man

252
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:22,614
was a victim of collateral damage from Hitmonkey's
attack. A funeral was held for the wall-crawler,

253
00:22:22,914 --> 00:22:28,758
which Hitmonkey attended out of remorse, believing
he had accidentally killed Spidey. As the primate

254
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:33,781
approached the casket to pay his respects, Deadpool
burst out and tried to gun down the monkey,

255
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:39,264
but Spider-Man swung in and stopped their fight,
leading to Hitmonkey's escape and to the long-lasting

256
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:44,504
rivalry between the two murderers. Eventually,
however, Deadpool and Hitmonkey talked it out,

257
00:22:44,744 --> 00:22:49,428
and Hitmonkey turned over a new leaf, joining
SHIELD's howling commando subdivision that

258
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:54,592
dealt with supernatural threats. Hitmonkey later
joined Deadpool and Domino's mercenary team

259
00:22:54,632 --> 00:22:59,296
called the Mercs for Money, though the primate's
mission was to monitor the team on behalf of

260
00:22:59,356 --> 00:23:04,840
SHIELD. At one point, Deadpool inadvertently
assisted the evil organization HYDRA during

261
00:23:04,921 --> 00:23:09,784
its takeover of the United States, and he put
a 20 million dollar bounty on his own head

262
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:15,989
as a means of Punishment. Hitmonkey was brought
in alongside other heroes to help put a stop

263
00:23:16,029 --> 00:23:21,333
to the resulting chaos caused by villains out
to collect Deadpool's head. And that's Hitmonkey's

264
00:23:21,373 --> 00:23:26,876
backstory so far. Now, he has no powers to speak
of, save for his simian physiology that makes

265
00:23:26,896 --> 00:23:32,480
him stronger and faster than your average human.
He has opposable thumbs on his hands and feet,

266
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:38,244
allowing him to wield weapons such as guns and
swords with extreme dexterity no matter which

267
00:23:38,364 --> 00:23:44,232
limb he uses. This ability, combined with his
mastery of martial arts and marksmanship skills,

268
00:23:44,512 --> 00:23:50,216
make him an unpredictable and dangerous killer.
He carries two handguns and often uses a samurai

269
00:23:50,256 --> 00:23:54,980
sword in battle. Occasionally, Hitmonkey has
been known to commune with the spirit of the

270
00:23:55,020 --> 00:24:00,343
deceased assassin that instructed him in how
to kill. And that's Hitmonkey. So he's like

271
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:05,547
a small version of John Wick. Exactly, that
is a fantastic way to put it. He's a small

272
00:24:05,587 --> 00:24:10,966
version of John Wick if John Wick couldn't speak
any human language. and also had thumbs on

273
00:24:11,006 --> 00:24:15,327
his feet, even though Hitmonkey would annihilate
John Wick because he's just that little bit

274
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:19,948
better. This actually makes me like really interested
in the cartoon. I haven't started watching

275
00:24:20,028 --> 00:24:23,929
it yet, but that sounded like a lot of fun.
Not going to lie. And honestly, now that I

276
00:24:23,949 --> 00:24:28,711
have covid, like I have all day to watch it.
You know, I don't know any Marvel fans that

277
00:24:28,751 --> 00:24:33,852
have caught covid. It's only DC fans that I
know of. What? Yeah. Wow. Interesting, huh?

278
00:24:34,132 --> 00:24:39,618
DC must stand for like Delta covid. I'm going
to go cough in your face. I think that's illegal,

279
00:24:39,658 --> 00:24:45,181
isn't it? Yeah. Okay, nevermind. Go ahead, I'll
sue your ass. Well, you know what else I've

280
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:50,824
been watching on TV this past week? Super Friends
as research for this episode. And I gotta say,

281
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:55,747
I love those classic Justice League cartoons.
They're great. How big is Gleek's role in the

282
00:24:55,767 --> 00:25:00,590
Super Friends cartoon? It depends on episode
to episode. They're all kind of like anthological

283
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:05,332
in a way. But he is one of the recurring characters.
He's in almost like every episode. Since we

284
00:25:05,372 --> 00:25:10,063
began doing these charity animal duels. I would
say all of the DC characters have been pretty

285
00:25:10,244 --> 00:25:15,328
obscure. Gleek is probably the least obscure
character I've done since he was a regular

286
00:25:15,468 --> 00:25:20,492
on the Super Friends cartoon, but he also has,
I would say, the least amount of incontinuity

287
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:26,157
backstory for a character I've ever written
about. Like all in all, he's had around 20

288
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:32,283
issues of canonical appearances, with the vast
majority of them being minor cameos. Gleek

289
00:25:32,323 --> 00:25:37,747
and his Wonder Twin owners first appeared in
1977. during the Hanna-Barbera animated series,

290
00:25:37,947 --> 00:25:43,771
The All-New Super Friends Hour, which was a
spin-off of 1973's Super Friends. The Super

291
00:25:43,811 --> 00:25:50,135
Friends have had a total of six spin-off series
that lasted until 1986, and of all the series,

292
00:25:50,375 --> 00:25:56,340
Gleek and his Wonder Twin owners appeared regularly
in five of them. The All-New Super Friends

293
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:02,664
Hour series also notably introduced a more diverse
cast of new characters in Black Vulcan, Apache

294
00:26:02,684 --> 00:26:08,763
Chief, Samurai, and El Dorado. As I mentioned
in our Wonder Twins vs Cloak and Dagger episode,

295
00:26:09,203 --> 00:26:14,865
the Wonder Twins and Gleek supplanted the powerless
characters of Wendy, Marvin, and their Wonder

296
00:26:14,905 --> 00:26:19,427
Dog from the original Super Friends series as
the young audience surrogates on the show,

297
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:25,389
as Gleek and the twins were able to take a more
active part in the stories since they had superpowers.

298
00:26:25,770 --> 00:26:31,332
Gleek, like the Wonder Twins Xan and Jaina,
was from the planet Exor, where, according

299
00:26:31,372 --> 00:26:37,823
to the Super Friends show, many monkeys existed
just like him. In fact, in one episode, they

300
00:26:37,924 --> 00:26:43,048
all visited Earth in spaceships in an attempt
to take over the planet because X-Or doesn't

301
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:48,153
have bananas. They had been monitoring Gleek
for some time and sought from him information

302
00:26:48,213 --> 00:26:53,297
on how to destroy the Super Friends. Bombarded
by a banana brain blaster, Gleek was forced

303
00:26:53,377 --> 00:26:58,402
to reveal the team's secrets and nearly succeeded
in destroying Superman, Batman, and Wonder

304
00:26:58,442 --> 00:27:03,859
Woman with a disintegrator ray, but was stopped
by Jan and Xana, after they broke free from

305
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:10,304
the clutches of a giant Gleek robot. Jaina immediately
transformed into an electric eel and zapped

306
00:27:10,344 --> 00:27:15,088
Gleek free from his mind control. Once the Water
Twins and Gleek rescued the Justice League,

307
00:27:15,248 --> 00:27:20,873
the Exorian Monkeys were returned to their ships
and escorted back to the planet Exor. The episode

308
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:26,718
ended, as most Super France episodes did, with
a gag from Gleek, who this time confused a

309
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:33,018
banana blaster for an edible banana, zapping
himself silly. In the non-canonical Super Friends

310
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:38,681
comic, it was revealed that members of Gleek's
species are known as Elastomunks. Gleek was

311
00:27:38,761 --> 00:27:44,104
first owned by an Exorian clown named Illic,
who trained him as part of a traveling intergalactic

312
00:27:44,144 --> 00:27:49,267
circus from Exor. Illic was a good man who helped
educate the Wonder Twins when they were brought

313
00:27:49,347 --> 00:27:54,310
on as part of the show. Gleek took a liking
to the twins and escaped the circus with them

314
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:58,392
when they found out they weren't getting paid
for their performances. After their escape,

315
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:03,807
the twins discovered on a nearby planet that
the Superman villain, Grax, was going to attack

316
00:28:03,927 --> 00:28:09,090
Earth, and Gleek traveled with the twins to
Earth in order to warn the Super Friends, and

317
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:14,033
they stayed on the planet in order to learn
to use their powers as superheroes. After the

318
00:28:14,053 --> 00:28:19,297
Super Friends cartoon and comic ended, the Wonder
Twins would enter mainstream DC continuity

319
00:28:19,397 --> 00:28:25,600
in the mid-90s in the title, Extreme Justice.
But Gleek, unfortunately, did not appear with

320
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,583
them. He did appear, however, in the line of
children's books based on the DC superpets

321
00:28:30,903 --> 00:28:36,126
where he helped Beppo the super monkey defeat
Gorilla Grodd when the circus came to Metropolis.

322
00:28:36,626 --> 00:28:42,810
It wasn't until 2019 that Gleek made his official
DC comics debut in a 12 issue Wonder Twins

323
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:48,973
miniseries. In this post-Flashpoint continuity
it was established that Xan and Jaina weren't

324
00:28:49,113 --> 00:28:55,077
circus performers but the grandchildren of Exor's
equivalent of Hitler. Their father sent them

325
00:28:55,117 --> 00:28:59,390
to earth with Superman, so that they wouldn't
have to suffer the shame and sense of their

326
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:04,892
grandfather. While on Earth, Zand bought Gleek
through a magazine ad that some circus performers

327
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:10,433
put together in order to save Gleek from his
abusive circus environment. Gleek's circus

328
00:29:10,473 --> 00:29:15,795
was run by a supervillain known as the Ringmaster,
who would force Gleek to ride a tiny bicycle

329
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:22,437
through flaming hoops and other hazards. Because
of the kindness Zand showed Gleek, he single-handedly

330
00:29:22,517 --> 00:29:27,234
rescued the twins when they were captured by
the League of Annoyance. a small-time cadre

331
00:29:27,274 --> 00:29:33,677
of villains organized by Lex Luthor to cultivate
sporadic chaos around Washington, D.C. Later,

332
00:29:33,777 --> 00:29:37,619
when the League of Annoyance tried to get a
Phantom Zone projector from the Wonder Twins,

333
00:29:37,979 --> 00:29:43,241
their recent recruit, Ringmaster, succeeded
in ring-tossing the twins into another trap,

334
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:48,264
only for Gleek to emerge from Zan's backpack
and start punching out his former abusive owner,

335
00:29:48,384 --> 00:29:53,988
Ringmaster. Gleek was tased by cell phone Sylvia
during the pummeling. but the distraction worked,

336
00:29:54,308 --> 00:29:59,250
and the Wonder Twins were able to send the bad
guys to the Phantom Zone. Most recently, Gleek

337
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:04,453
and the twins were seen helping Young Justice
bring down rogue scientists within Star Labs,

338
00:30:04,593 --> 00:30:09,375
and became official members of that team by
its conclusion. Powers-wise, Gleek has the

339
00:30:09,395 --> 00:30:14,917
physiology of an Exorian Elastomonk, granting
him his blue-furred appearance and prehensile

340
00:30:14,957 --> 00:30:19,800
tail that he's able to extend to any length,
with a tensile strength that allows him to

341
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,582
lift up to a quarter ton. He's also smarter
than your average Earth Monkey, capable of

342
00:30:24,642 --> 00:30:31,944
understanding human speech, average human, often
to humorous effect. Well, same thing with Hitmonkey.

343
00:30:32,144 --> 00:30:36,425
While he can understand humans, he's not as
smart as them. But Gleek is also clever by

344
00:30:36,485 --> 00:30:41,467
nature, capable of hiding empty buckets and
bananas and drawing them out from seemingly

345
00:30:41,587 --> 00:30:48,108
nowhere at will. His ass? We'll never know,
but probably. Not gonna lie. He has that infinitely

346
00:30:48,148 --> 00:30:54,089
stretchable tail, but also probably an infinite
stretchable colon, is my guess. And that's

347
00:30:54,129 --> 00:30:59,213
Gleek. This will be pretty good, it kind of
reminds me of like Mr. Fantastic vs. The Punisher

348
00:30:59,253 --> 00:31:03,397
or something like that. But now that we got
these monkeys' histories and abilities out

349
00:31:03,437 --> 00:31:08,601
of the way, let's speculate on how one of the
1000 simulated matches will go. The winner

350
00:31:08,641 --> 00:31:13,265
is determined by simulations, not the speculation,
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could

351
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:17,429
play out. Now we don't set any rules for this
match other than the characters don't know

352
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:21,933
anything about each other going in. Except that
the other character is a threat that needs

353
00:31:21,953 --> 00:31:26,873
to be put down. We say that they start off about
50 meters apart in an environment that has

354
00:31:26,993 --> 00:31:31,456
no bearing on the match itself because we don't
take stats for the environment. Plus, certain

355
00:31:31,496 --> 00:31:35,620
characters have advantages in some environments
over others, and we want these characters to

356
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,343
win on their own merit. So let's get into it.
Gleek and Hitmonkey meet on the battlefield.

357
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:44,867
Who goes first? Okay, I'm gonna say Hitmonkey
goes first because he's kind of like this little

358
00:31:44,987 --> 00:31:50,352
ball of fury. Okay? So he's gonna start off
by reaching into his suit jacket, and with

359
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:54,758
one hand, he's gonna pull out his cool shades.
and put him on, and with the other hand, he's

360
00:31:54,778 --> 00:31:59,840
gonna pull out a fucking Glock 19. And he's
gonna point it right at Gleek, like badass

361
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:05,242
sideways gangster style, and he's just gonna
start unloading rounds. Okay, once Gleek sees

362
00:32:05,283 --> 00:32:10,805
the gun, he's gonna be like, wow! He's gonna
use his tail to like spring away as Hitmonkey

363
00:32:10,825 --> 00:32:16,127
is shooting. And while Hitmonkey is like focusing
on hitting center mass as Gleek is just like

364
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:21,349
bouncing around like a pinball, Gleek is going
to stretch out his tail and just whip the gun

365
00:32:21,409 --> 00:32:25,338
right out of Hitmonkey's hand. Well that pisses
Hitmonkey off, you know, he's gonna screech

366
00:32:25,658 --> 00:32:31,260
in frustration and then he's gonna charge Gleek
on all fours with his monkey speed and he's

367
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:36,181
gonna leap through the air and he's gonna do
this flying kick that, well, I guess, is it

368
00:32:36,201 --> 00:32:41,403
a kick or is it a punch? Right, yeah, with the
monkey it's probably always a punch But it's

369
00:32:41,423 --> 00:32:46,464
gonna connect and hit Gleek right in his dome
piece Okay, okay so Gleek probably drops to

370
00:32:46,484 --> 00:32:50,485
the floor and he's gonna retract his tail but
when he gets up to his feet he's gonna put

371
00:32:50,505 --> 00:32:58,275
his arms up like a boxer and start hopping back
and forth like, wah-wah-wah-wah, wah-

372
00:33:18,902 --> 00:33:23,384
I'm trying to add insult to injury. That's gonna
infuriate Hitmonkey. So he's gonna screech

373
00:33:23,424 --> 00:33:28,287
again, and he's gonna reach toward his back
and ensheath the samurai sword that he has.

374
00:33:28,647 --> 00:33:32,629
What? And he's gonna spin it around, and he's
gonna swing it at Gleek and just slice off

375
00:33:32,669 --> 00:33:37,972
his tail. How does Hitmonkey have a samurai
sword small enough for his body? You know,

376
00:33:37,992 --> 00:33:42,074
it's one of those short swords. Oh, like the,
what is it called, the Shoto? Yeah, sure. One

377
00:33:42,094 --> 00:33:49,602
of the, okay. Okay, that's dumb. So Gleek, he's
gonna yell. and run away. And I'm sure Hitmonkey

378
00:33:49,622 --> 00:33:54,784
is gonna be chasing after him, just swinging
that sword around wildly. But Gleek, he's gonna

379
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:59,366
conjure a banana, all right? And he's gonna
peel it, eat the banana, then throw the peel

380
00:33:59,386 --> 00:34:05,569
behind him, causing Hitmonkey to slip and drop
his sword, which Gleek grabs with this still

381
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:09,611
functional stretchy tail, even though it's been
cut, he can still stretch it. And he's gonna

382
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:14,874
start swinging that around like crazy. So Gleek
is still able to stretch his tail, even though

383
00:34:15,134 --> 00:34:20,276
it's been cut. Yeah, essentially you did nothing
by cutting it. Gleek is, you know, trying to

384
00:34:20,356 --> 00:34:25,459
swipe at Hitmonkey with his katana sword, but
Hitmonkey is agile, you know, he dodges these

385
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:31,462
slashes and he runs around Gleek, and by running
around him, Hitmonkey causes Gleek to wrap

386
00:34:31,482 --> 00:34:37,304
himself up with his own tail and drop the sword.
Then with Gleek all wrapped up, Hitmonkey's

387
00:34:37,324 --> 00:34:42,475
just gonna punch him right in his face. And
that's gonna send Gleek flying back, but Hitmonkey's

388
00:34:42,515 --> 00:34:47,977
gonna grab his tail and just yo-yo him back.
What? Causing him to come winding back up and

389
00:34:48,017 --> 00:34:52,059
then get hit again. And Hitmonkey just keeps
doing this. That's a pretty good move. You

390
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,921
know, Gleek, he's probably dizzy and seeing
stars, but he's just gonna shake it off. Since

391
00:34:56,941 --> 00:35:01,263
Hitmonkey is holding onto his tail, Gleek is
just gonna loop his tail around Hitmonkey's

392
00:35:01,343 --> 00:35:04,964
wrist, and he's just gonna lift him into the
air and start slamming him into the ground

393
00:35:05,004 --> 00:35:12,845
repeatedly, like, bam bam! Well, after getting
slammed a few times, I'm gonna say that Hitmonkey

394
00:35:12,965 --> 00:35:18,509
reaches into his suit with his feet. And he's
gonna pull out another Glock. And then before

395
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:23,793
Gleek can slam him again, he shoots that blue
monkey right through one of his eyes. Dang!

396
00:35:23,853 --> 00:35:31,315
Why? Jeez. No, I mean, that would kill Gleek.
I'm gonna say that once Gleek sees the gun,

397
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:36,179
he's gonna pull out his trusty metal pail and
put it over his head like a helmet, blocking

398
00:35:36,219 --> 00:35:36,660
the bullet.

399
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:45,878
That pale, he uses that to carry Xan, right?
Yeah, whenever he's like in a water form. Okay,

400
00:35:45,898 --> 00:35:51,082
so this metal pale blocks the bullet from killing
him, but Gleek is gonna be rattled by this,

401
00:35:51,162 --> 00:35:55,626
you know? And therefore he's gonna let go of
Hitmonkey with his tail. So Hitmonkey falls

402
00:35:55,646 --> 00:36:00,810
to the ground, probably drops his gun, but when
Gleek removes his metal pale helmet, he's gonna

403
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:05,034
see like multiple Hitmonkeys like vibrating
around just because he was so rattled. And

404
00:36:05,054 --> 00:36:12,174
in addition to seeing multiple Hitmonkeys, he
also sees multiple brown gooey masses flying

405
00:36:12,235 --> 00:36:18,457
at his face. What? Yeah, that's right. Hitmonkey
just threw some feces, and it blinds Gleek,

406
00:36:18,538 --> 00:36:23,640
hits him right in the eye. I had a feeling this
was gonna turn into a shit show. Ha ha ha.

407
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:30,183
And when Gleek wipes the monkey poo away from
his face, he sees nothing. Hitmonkey has vanished

408
00:36:30,243 --> 00:36:35,906
from the battlefield. He's gone? Yeah, like
Batman. He's stealthy like that. Okay. Gleeky,

409
00:36:35,946 --> 00:36:39,968
you know, he's probably gonna be clutching his
pale helmet and just like looking around for

410
00:36:40,168 --> 00:36:46,872
Hitmonkey. I don't know. Well, Hitmonkey suddenly
appears behind Gleek with like this loud screech.

411
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:54,576
He unleashes a flurry of shit missiles that
just pelt Gleek to death like being stoned.

412
00:36:54,596 --> 00:36:59,399
Dude, why is this monkey so constipated that
his shit is so hard and sharp that it would

413
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:06,854
kill someone? He had a lot of dairy. Okay. But
you said he screeches, so Gleek is gonna hear

414
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:12,156
that screech, and he's just gonna instantly
begin twirling his tail like a fan blade, just

415
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:20,699
generating a gust that's strong enough to redirect
these turd torpedoes back at Hitmonkey, killing

416
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:28,470
him instead. Hitmonkey's not gonna go down by
his own poo, alright? He just did. Wha- Can

417
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:34,253
we just end it here then? So either Gleek dies
from getting pelted to death from Hitmonkey's

418
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:40,557
poo, or Gleek is able to redirect the turds
back at Hitmonkey who dies. I'm fine with that.

419
00:37:40,638 --> 00:37:46,962
I honestly have no idea how you could top poo
flinging in a monkey battle. Alright, so let's

420
00:37:46,982 --> 00:37:50,104
go ahead and run these characters through the
Monte-Caller simulations and come back with

421
00:37:50,124 --> 00:37:50,384
a winner.

422
00:37:55,082 --> 00:38:01,104
In what other Marvel vs DC matchup can you do
a poof linking battle? Besides this one. Yeah,

423
00:38:01,124 --> 00:38:07,787
I don't know. I guess technically you could
do it for any battle, but why would you? That's

424
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:13,830
true. These guys were fairly comparable. I thought
that Hitmonkey was absolutely going to have

425
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:19,452
an advantage due to the fact that he has fucking
guns, you know, and he could shoot at Gleek

426
00:38:19,492 --> 00:38:24,976
from a long range. But surprisingly, Gleek has
an even longer range than Hitmonkey with his

427
00:38:25,016 --> 00:38:30,160
stretchable tail. Right, right. Also, Gleek
is stronger than Hitmonkey because of that

428
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:35,025
same tail. Yeah, yeah, the tail is his strongest
weapon. It's his only weapon, and it's no joke.

429
00:38:35,205 --> 00:38:40,349
And it's so versatile too, like able to form
a spring to like a helicopter twirl. Yeah,

430
00:38:40,389 --> 00:38:45,714
that's right. But where Gleek couldn't touch
Hitmonkey at all was in his martial arts ability.

431
00:38:45,994 --> 00:38:52,627
Hitmonkey is vastly superior in his hand combat.
in every other category, these monkeys were

432
00:38:52,647 --> 00:38:57,729
comparable. Considering that, who do you think
won this match? I think it's Gleek. I think

433
00:38:57,769 --> 00:39:03,112
his tail is way more special than, you know,
a couple of guns and maybe a knife. Though

434
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:09,336
I have to say, Instagram does not agree with
me. 73% of our Instagram followers who voted,

435
00:39:09,696 --> 00:39:15,419
voted in favor of Hitmonkey, which I'm not surprised.
Like, how many of them actually watched the

436
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:19,821
Super Friends cartoon? How many of them actually
know about Gleek? I'm gonna assume all of them.

437
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:24,660
and that they are very smart and well versed.
Maybe. Hitmonkey does have a show that is like

438
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:30,143
on Hulu right now. So I'm sure his popularity
factor played a part in why he won this poll.

439
00:39:30,563 --> 00:39:36,226
Well, he won the poll, did he win the matches?
I have the results here. Let's find out. The

440
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:45,812
winner of the duel between Gleek and Hitmonkey
is Hitmonkey. Damn it! But it was fairly close.

441
00:39:46,152 --> 00:39:53,236
This was a commendable fight. Hitmonkey won.
534 matches out of the 1000, whereas Gleek

442
00:39:53,297 --> 00:40:01,842
won 466, so that's 53.4% to 46.6. Fairly close,
but Hitmonkey is a straight up killer, and

443
00:40:02,003 --> 00:40:07,987
just way more badass than Gleek. I can't even
argue with that, honestly. Like Gleek is anything

444
00:40:08,087 --> 00:40:13,230
but badass. He's silly though, he's cute and
silly. I am surprised by the results though,

445
00:40:13,451 --> 00:40:19,818
I thought Gleek was gonna just spank that monkey's
red ass tail. Oh, we didn't do that in speculation

446
00:40:19,858 --> 00:40:25,301
then. We should have done that. Well, Hitmonkey
is just on top of the world now. Not only did

447
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:29,922
he win this duel against Gleek, he of course
has that show on Hulu, which has been doing

448
00:40:29,962 --> 00:40:34,524
really well. It has like a 90 percent audience
score on Rotten Tomatoes and an 80 percent

449
00:40:34,564 --> 00:40:38,846
critic score. I'm like five episodes in. It's
pretty good. We're going to review that show

450
00:40:38,926 --> 00:40:43,768
in our next episode. So look forward to that.
And when it comes to Gleek, I would actually

451
00:40:43,828 --> 00:40:49,835
recommend checking out Adult Swim's parody of
the wonder twins? Yeah, they did these wonder

452
00:40:49,875 --> 00:40:56,838
twins shorts based off of like old quote unquote
lost footage of their adventures. There's like

453
00:40:56,898 --> 00:41:00,579
five of them. They're hilarious. You could find
them on YouTube. But that does it for this

454
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:05,121
duel. Let us know what you guys thought about
