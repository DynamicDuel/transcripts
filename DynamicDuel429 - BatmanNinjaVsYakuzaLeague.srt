This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. I'm Marvelous
Joe and I'm his twin brother Johnny DC. And in this

2
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:46,040
episode we are going to review the latest DC
animated direct video release Batman Ninja vs.

3
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:53,740
Yakuza League. It is the sequel to the 2018 Batman
Ninja film, which was phenomenal. Does the sequel

4
00:00:53,740 --> 00:01:00,060
hold up? We will let you know later on this episode.
Yes it does. I said later on this episode. Come on

5
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:05,600
man, now they have no reason to listen to the rest.
They will. Especially since this is an all DC

6
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,580
episode because before the review we're going to
break down the latest comic book movie news that

7
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,820
came out this past week, of which there was just one
news item and that was the report on Colin Farrell

8
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,060
being in talks to play Sergeant Rock in that movie.
Yeah we're going to talk about that later. As

with that out of the way. Quick to the No Prize! A No

31
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,440
Prize is an award Marvel used to give out to fans.
Our version, the Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a

32
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:33,400
digital award that we post on Instagram for the
person that we feel gave the best answer to our

33
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,880
question of the week. Last week we asked you guys,
what character do you think Sadie Sink will be

34
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,880
playing in the upcoming fourth Spider-Man film
from Marvel Studios? That was coming off of the

35
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,980
news that Sadie Sink has been cast in a role in the
fourth Spider-Man movie though no one knows what

36
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,740
that role is. So we asked you guys what your
thoughts were. We got three honorable mentions to

37
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,080
get through as well as one No Prize winner. Our
first honorable mention goes to Christopher

38
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:05,260
Manati, who said, Hi guys, Christopher Manati. So
I don't know that much about Sadie Sink, I haven't

39
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,440
seen Stranger Things or anything so my answer is
more based on a character I want to show up and that

40
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,900
would be Black Cat. I really like Black Cat as a
character and I've wanted her to show up in a

41
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:22,640
Spider-Man movie for a little while and I think it
could lead to some very funny scenes, especially

42
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:29,400
with Tom Holland's Spider-Man and with how
awkward he is. So yeah, that's my answer. Yeah, I

43
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,100
think that thematically introducing Black Cat
into Spider-Man 4 would make sense, considering,

44
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:40,800
you know, at the end of Spider-Man 3, Peter Parker
was resigned to kind of move on with his life with MJ

45
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:47,260
and Ned for getting all about him. And so it would be
interesting to see how he copes with moving on from

46
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:52,000
that relationship with this new superhero chick
who's really into him and maybe there's a romantic

47
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,720
connection between them. Yeah, it would be a test
of his love, whether he has moved on from MJ as she

48
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:05,080
has or not. I agree, I think thematically it would
work. Now, whether or not Sadie Sink could

49
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,380
actually play the character of Black Cat in the way
I would envision the character of Black Cat to

50
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:15,540
appear on the silver screen, I don't know about
that. But it's an interesting idea nonetheless.

51
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,200
Well, who could play Black Cat in the way that you
envision, do you think? I don't know, like Sidney

52
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:25,620
Sweeney, I know that's a really kind of obvious
answer and it can't really happen since she played

53
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:31,160
Julia Carpenter in Madame Web, but that's kind of
who I was thinking would make an ideal Black Cat.

54
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,740
No, because I have dibs on her for Power Girl. I
guess that would make more sense than showing up in

55
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,640
Spider-Man 4 as a different character within the
Spider-Man universe. That's right. Great

56
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,780
answer, Christopher. Our next honorable mention
goes to Travis Herndon, who said, What's up,

57
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,440
dynamic dudes? Travis here. Shout out to my evil
twin. So my answer has to be Gene Gray, since the MCU

58
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,380
is following the ultimate Spider-Man
interpretation of the character who was the first

59
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:05,080
X-Man he met in the comics. Gene Gray. And if I could
say that X-Man characters would be popping in and

60
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:12,340
out of future MCU projects, so it would make sense
to introduce Gene right now so we can get a look at

61
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,180
her. Yeah, I can see this making sense too. In the
initial Ultimate comics, which came out in the

62
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,260
early aughts, Ultimate Spider-Man had a
crossover with the Ultimate X-Man. And while I

63
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:27,300
wouldn't say that the MCU is a direct adaptation of
the Ultimate line of comics, it's really a mixture

64
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:32,980
of both Ultimate Universe and the 616 Universe. I
think it would be totally cool for the heroes to

65
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,600
meet up with each other while they're still early
in their respective careers. And actually have

66
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:44,260
X-Man springboard as a wear off of the Spider-Man
franchise. Yeah, I would not hate that. I think she

67
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:49,240
would be a fantastic Gene Gray. And whether she
makes her first appearance in the Spider-Man

68
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,480
movie or any other Marvel movie, I don't think it
matters, because I actually think she's perfect

69
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:59,580
casting for a younger version of that character.
Yeah, and then she grows with the role. Boom. Great

70
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:06,840
answer, Travis. Our final honorable mention goes
to by Dear Bangura, who said, Hello, dynamic duo. I

71
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:14,060
think that Sadie Sink should play Kitty Pride. I
think there in the Ultimate comics, she was a

72
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:20,100
redhead that was dating Peter Parker. So I think
that would be a great combination and it would be a

73
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:26,520
great red herring. Thank you. Yeah, so similar to
the Gene Gray answer, I think I actually like this

74
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,740
idea more where she's potentially playing Kitty
Pride, because in the Ultimate comic books, Kitty

75
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,600
Pride and Peter Parker were an item in the same way
like Black Cat and Peter Parker were an item. But

76
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,240
Kitty Pride is a member of the X-Men as Shadow Cat.
So you can still have that X-Men crossover there,

77
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,700
but with also a potential love interest, as
opposed to Gene Gray, who was not a love interest

78
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,580
for Peter Parker. So I think Kitty Pride kind of
serves the best of both worlds in terms of the X-Men

79
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:58,200
with Gene Gray and in terms of a romantic interest
angle with Black Cat, because she is both of those

80
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:04,280
things. Oh, I had no idea that Kitty Pride dated
Peter Parker in the Ultimate universe. Yeah, I

81
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,580
still think Sadie would make a better Gene Gray,
though I do like the idea of introducing Kitty

82
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:15,920
Pride as a love interest in a Spider-Man movie.
Now, is that just due to the red hair? Oh, 100% yes.

83
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:21,680
Okay, okay. Great answer by dear. We want to give a
quick shout out to Mason Thompson and Lee Tapscott

84
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,460
for calling in with their answers. But the winner
of this week's No Prize is Harrison Fox, who said,

85
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:33,260
Hey guys, Harrison Fox. So initially I was
thinking that Sadie would be playing Black Cat,

86
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:39,360
but the more I think about it, the more I feel that
maybe it's going to be Gwen Stacy. And this version

87
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,740
of Gwen Stacy, instead of being killed off in a very
dramatic way, will become our Spider-Gwen. And

88
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:51,460
then we can have a Spider-Woman character do
something, unlike the three that were introduced

89
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:57,100
in Madam Web. I think that would be a great idea. I
really like this idea. Now, we all know that Gwen

90
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:02,680
Stacy's fate is to die at the hands of Green Goblin,
but we've seen that done in the amazing Spider-Man

91
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:08,580
films with Andrew Garfield. And I think that fans
are clamoring for a live action version of

92
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:15,000
Spider-Gwen. So it's entirely possible that
Sadie Sink is playing Gwen Stacy, and they'll be

93
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,900
riffing on the character's history by
incorporating a little bit of Spider-Gwen story

94
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,460
from her respective universe. You can totally see
this happening, especially since Spider-Man 4 is

95
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:30,260
supposed to take place between the two Avengers
movies, and therefore you could introduce some

96
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:36,340
multiversal elements into it. I don't know, Sadie
Sink would look like Blonde? Well, I mean, Bryce

97
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:42,440
Dallas Howard played Gwen Stacy in Spider-Man 3,
and she was given a wig or dyed her hair blonde. So

98
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,520
there's precedent there in terms of the hair
color. What I like most about this answer, though,

99
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,640
is that it didn't deal with the X-Men. It dealt more
with the Spider-Verse, which is really where I

100
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,840
think the franchise should be going. And also, you
know, Spider-Gwen could be a potential love

101
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,740
interest as well. Because I don't think we've seen
that in the comics. I don't think we've seen

102
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,880
Spider-Gwen be a love interest for 616
Spider-Man. So great answer, Harrison Fox. You

103
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,260
win this week's No Prize. If you the listener want a
shot at winning your own No Prize, stay tuned to

104
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:13,320
later on this episode when we'll be asking another
question of the week. And now that that's done, on

105
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:24,800
to the news! Okay, so not too long ago, we learned
that Luca Guadagnino, the director of films such

106
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:31,580
as Challengers and Suspiria, pitched James Gunn
and Peter Saffron, the heads of DC Studios, on a

107
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,200
Sergeant Rock film written by his longtime
writing collaborator, Justin Karitsky. Now,

108
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:42,860
initially, the rumors were that Daniel Craig was
interested in playing the title role of Sergeant

109
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:48,660
Rock, considering he had just come off of working
with Luca Guadagnino in the film Queer. But it

110
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:54,360
looks like Daniel Craig has moved on from the
Sergeant Rock role, and currently Colin Farrell

111
00:10:54,360 --> 00:11:00,560
is in talks to star as Sergeant Rock. Thank God,
man. All right, I was getting really scared there

112
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:06,000
that DC was going to nab up another James Bond
actor, and just can't have that. Just cannot have

113
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,300
that. Now Daniel Craig can come over to Marvel
where he belongs. Yeah, it's never going to

114
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:16,840
happen. Now, this is interesting because Colin
Farrell is famously, and to much acclaim, already

115
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:24,300
playing Oswald Cobb, the Penguin in Matt Reeves,
The Batman Universe. Of course, he plays that role

116
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:31,460
under heavy makeup, and he's basically
unrecognizable in both voice and demeanor. So I

117
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:37,360
could actually see this working. Oh, absolutely.
Colin Farrell is one of the more dynamic actors of

118
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,300
his generation. The guys at Chameleon, he could do
anything, and you would never even know that the

119
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:48,260
actors were the same. Yeah, I mean, an actor of his
caliber can clearly pull off anything. I am

120
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,320
concerned, though, about the physicality of the
role. Like, Colin Farrell doesn't strike me as

121
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,080
being, like, as physical as a soldier would need to
be. What are you talking about? He was super

122
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:06,420
physical in Daredevil as the character Bullseye.
Ugh, don't remind me. But no, like, in the past, a

123
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:11,860
Sergeant Rock film has been attempted by actors
such as Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

124
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:16,540
Like, they've tried to make this film before, but
they just never came to pass. And what I think of

125
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:24,100
Colin Farrell, I don't necessarily think action
star in the same way that I do actors like Willis and

126
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,800
Schwarzenegger. I think Colin Farrell could
totally pull that off too, though, the 80s action

127
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,000
era. The only way I see this working is if it's more
like a saving private Ryan-type film, as opposed

128
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,020
to something like, I don't know, Rambo. So you're
thinking he's more Tom Hanks than Ben Affleck in

129
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:46,160
Pearl Harbor? Yeah, which doesn't surprise me
considering the director. He hasn't really done a

130
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,580
big war movie like this, or like too much action in
general, outside of a tennis match. So yeah, I can

131
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:57,900
see this definitely being more cerebral than
action, which is fine by me, honestly. I mean, if

132
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:03,140
his pitch was good enough for James Gunn and Peter
Saffron, it's good enough for me, and I can't wait

133
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:08,020
to see if Colin Farrell's cast. Someone needs to be
cast relatively soon because they want to start

134
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:13,860
shooting this movie this summer. Who would be your
ideal actor if it wasn't Colin Farrell? Oh,

135
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:19,980
interesting question. Yeah, who's a big name
action star right now? Uh, Chris Hemsworth? Thor,

136
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:25,060
really? Yeah, he's done with Marvel. After Love
and Thunder, just let him move on, poor guy. The

137
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,620
hell is wrong with you? I regret asking this
question because you just gave the absolutely

138
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:36,540
worst answer of all time. Or, or the best answer.
No. Speaking of Colin Farrell playing both the

139
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:45,820
penguin and potentially Sergeant Rock, that
brings us to our question of the week. What Marvel

140
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:52,300
or DC actor whose performance was hidden by
practical or special effects would you like to see

141
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:58,080
play another character? And which one? We've seen
this before with actors like Gemma Chan, who

142
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:04,220
played in Captain Marvel and The Eternals, and Jai
Minhatsu, who played in Aquaman and the Shazam

143
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,940
movies. But besides those two, what actor would
you choose? Record your answer at

all the news for this episode, so let's go ahead and

149
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,080
move into our main event, where we review the
latest DC animated film to hit home video, Batman

150
00:14:43,080 --> 00:15:03,620
Ninja vs Yakuza League. Batman Ninja vs Yakuza
League Okay, Batman Ninja vs Yakuza League. It's

151
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:10,920
the direct sequel to 2018's direct-to-video
anime feature, Batman Ninja. Both films were

152
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:18,080
written by Kazuki Nakashima and directed by
Junpei Mizusaki, with Shinji Takaji

153
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:25,260
co-directing the sequel. I loved the first film. I
love most anime I see honestly, especially if it's

154
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:30,860
DC related projects like my adventures with
Superman or Suicide Squad Isakai. They're some of

155
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:36,860
DC's greatest animated projects. But Batman
Ninja is a project that I've rewatched numerous

156
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:42,760
times since its release, and I love it every time I
watch it. I've had nothing but high expectations

157
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:49,520
for this sequel, which usually leads to some
disappointment, but not here. Batman Ninja vs

158
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:56,280
Yakuza League is a worthwhile successor to the
first film that amps up the action, the stakes, the

159
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:03,420
badass design, and the absurdism from the first
film to a whole other level. And I recommend it to

160
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:09,020
any Batman or anime fan out there. Yeah, I really
enjoyed this film. It also surpassed my

161
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:14,440
expectations. I was not expecting this to be as
good as the original Ninja Batman, which was

162
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,880
fantastic. You know, I had my criticisms of it, but
it still kind of held up in my mind, and now so does

163
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:25,840
the sequel. Absolutely. If you haven't seen this
movie yet, please make sure you do so before

164
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:31,180
listening to this spoiler review. The film is
available now on digital platforms, though

165
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:37,680
physical copies won't be available until
mid-April. Now, while I recommend the film, just

166
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,600
be aware that the original Japanese language
version was not available upon the film's early

167
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,920
digital release, but I'm hoping that it will be
available by the time the physical version comes

168
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:54,620
out. Yeah, that was fucking stupid. And really,
that's the only way I watched the original Batman

169
00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:00,540
Ninja was the Japanese audio. That's right. And so
I was like, I don't want to watch this now. I don't

170
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:08,260
really prefer dubs over subs. No, I 100% prefer
subs. I was pissed when I first realized the audio

171
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:13,180
issue with the digital release because I vastly
preferred the original Japanese language

172
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:19,440
version to the English dubs in the first film. But
to my surprise, you know, this English voice cast

173
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:25,020
for the sequel did a pretty decent job with the
film. I guess the dubbing was done by a company

174
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:32,240
called Sentai Filmworks, who does a lot of English
dubbing on anime projects, like My Hero Academia,

175
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:39,680
Sword Art Online, Food Wars, just a ton of anime.
I've seen some hate online saying Warner Brothers

176
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:45,460
cheaped out on getting the original voice cast
back. But honestly, good riddance, because in my

177
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:51,060
opinion, the dubbing in this film is way better
this go around. I mentioned earlier I didn't want

178
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:55,820
to watch the movie because they didn't have the
original Japanese audio. And I was kind of

179
00:17:55,820 --> 00:18:00,420
resigned to watching the film for this review with
the English language dubs. But I also was

180
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:06,720
surprised with the quality of the voice cast. It
takes a certain kind of special voice acting to

181
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:13,320
sell the kind of melodrama of a lot of anime
reactions and things like that. And a lot of

182
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:18,300
standard American voice actors just can't pull
off that kind of drama in a believable way. So you

183
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,080
can't just like hire a celebrity voice actor like
Tony Hale or something like that. You got to have a

184
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:29,660
qualified anime English voice actor to do this
stuff right. Absolutely. Like, I think I could do

185
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:35,680
some voice acting not well, but I could do it. I
could absolutely not do anime voice acting

186
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:41,780
because my voice would crack as soon as I try to get
overly emotional. I'm telling you right now, you

187
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:49,320
wouldn't be able to do any voice acting. Okay. Wow.
I have a podcast, bro. That doesn't mean anything.

188
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:57,820
Have you listened to this podcast? That's fair. My
voice sucks. Why are you even listening right now?

189
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:05,100
I wonder that every week. Anyway, moving on. In the
first film, Batman, his allies and his villains

190
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:10,880
were all transported back in time to feudal Japan
where Batman, unable to rely on much of his high

191
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,500
tech equipment, had to learn ancient techniques
of the ninja to stop an all out war between his

192
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,660
villains, while also finding a way to return
everyone to the proper time. That film began

193
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:27,180
fairly serious in tone, though by the end we were
watching giant mechazoid fortresses battle

194
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:33,480
monkeys stacked on top of each other in the shape of
Batman. Shit got weird, but I still loved it so much

195
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:39,980
so that I was convinced that it deserved a five star
review in my initial reaction. You talked me down

196
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:46,440
from that, Joseph. I think in part because of just
how absurd it became. But in this film, the sequel,

197
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:52,640
Yakuza League, they start with the absurdity
already ratcheted to 10. So you don't have that

198
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:58,700
jarring tonal shift to contend with like you did in
the first film. When you have jetpack wearing

199
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,820
katana wielding Yakuza gangsters raining down
from the sky within the first 10 minutes of the

200
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:09,660
movie, there's pretty much nothing you can't get
away with in this film. And though the story gets

201
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:15,600
pretty ambitious and the level of absurdity it can
get away with, where like even several of the

202
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,300
characters say that the story elements are dumb
during the course of the movie, the film subverts

203
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:27,640
expectations for Western audiences in
particular in such a way that is not only funny, but

204
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:33,460
just fun in general. And it captures your
attention in the way good art tends to. Yeah, what I

205
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:38,460
really appreciated about this movie was just how
self aware it was. You know, the first film did go

206
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:45,000
off the rails and I did take issue with that. But
this movie, like you said, starts off the rails,

207
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,220
and it comments on it like it knowingly does so. But
also it you know, it takes its time to explain the

208
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:56,980
absurdity behind everything going on for every
weird thing you see. There is a rational

209
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:03,460
explanation for it. And I do appreciate that, even
though it does lead to the film being 90%

210
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:11,080
exposition. Oh, I know. So so much dialogue in this
movie is them just explaining things, which

211
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:15,920
surprisingly worked. I don't know how they pulled
that off, but they did somehow. Maybe it had

212
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:20,500
something to do with the visuals, because this
film looks gorgeous. We've seen examples of

213
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:26,180
computer generated anime before, like in the
first Batman Ninja movie, or Batman and Superman

214
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:33,040
Battle of the Supersons. But this is hands down the
best example to date of that style, partly because

215
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,300
I believe they didn't try to overdo the shading and
lighting like the Japanese characters in this

216
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:45,340
film are fairly flatly colored and you know, are
identifiable by their sketchy contour lines, as

217
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:51,960
if to imply they are a sketch or like experimental
result of Russell Gould playing with reality. The

218
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:59,340
designs like the first film are admirably
complex, yet quintessentially Japanese like

219
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:05,640
everything in the film. Yeah, computer animated
anime is not my favorite thing. It's rarely done

220
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:10,900
well in the anime that I've seen, and you know,
myself not being an avid anime consumer. I didn't

221
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:15,100
really like the computer animation that was in the
first Batman Ninja movie. I thought everybody

222
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,620
walked a little bit too stiff. They look like
robots to me, you know, their faces were soulless

223
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:25,780
abominations. But here, actually, the film
completely reversed my opinion on computer

224
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:30,840
generated anime animation, because I thought it
was really well done. The movements looked

225
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:36,320
believable. The expressions had more life to
them. Everything just looked better, not

226
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,180
counting, you know, the hand drawn interlude that
was in the first Batman Ninja movie, because that

227
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:46,140
was beautifully done. Oh yeah, absolutely.
Besides that scene, I would definitely say though

228
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:51,080
that this film looks better than the first and the
story of this film is better than the first. You

229
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,440
know, we described the first film as being
narratively simple. And while this film still

230
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:02,480
follows that style over substance narrative
approach, this time the story has much more

231
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,080
complexity and is actually quite successful in
building an entirely new world with fascinating

232
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:14,240
characters whose stories may be glossed over, but
are brimming with possibility. Rather than

233
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,060
seeing how familiar characters adapt to a strange
new environment like the first film, here we see

234
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:26,180
how familiar characters are affected by exposure
to a strange new environment from the get go, from

235
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:32,660
birth, which brings a sense of Eltsworld intrigue
to the mix akin to something like Red Sun. Yeah,

236
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:37,500
that was really cool. I mean, what I liked probably
more about Batman's story in the first movie was

237
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:43,720
that he was a fish out of water and he had to become
something new. He had to become a ninja and study

238
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:50,120
the ninja way in order to survive in feudal Japan.
And feudal Japan as a setting was just phenomenal.

239
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:57,160
I liked it more than the setting of modern day Japan
being taken over by these Yakuza gangs. But I'll

240
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,520
still say that there was a lot of interest there and
that Batman was still a fish out of water with these

241
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:06,940
other characters that had changed into these
unique Japanese personas. Yeah, did you notice

242
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:14,500
the Easter egg around the Yakuza League's names?
It was their given names. Yeah, it was the Japanese

243
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:21,180
pronunciation of their first name. So Arthur
became Asa, Barry became Barry, Clark becomes

244
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:27,000
Koraku, and Jessica becomes Zeshika, so on and so
forth. I thought that was kind of cool. I didn't

245
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,020
realize that until I was writing my review. But
even beyond that, words like Hage-ne, the name of

246
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:38,400
the Yakuza family that Clark was the leader of,
means steel. Really? Yeah. Now, speaking of

247
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:45,480
Superman, his Japanese counterpart, Koraku, is
the only character in the film who actually gets a

248
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:52,120
real character arc. Batman has a mission, Diana
has a code, they grow to appreciate each other's

249
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:58,600
ways, but beyond that, they're static. Superman,
on the other hand, begins the film as an enforcer

250
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:04,720
for Russell Gull and the leader of the Hagen-E
crime family who views the world through the lens

251
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,030
of power. There's those who wield it, and there's
those who are subjugated by it. He compares Yakuza

252
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:16,830
to demons and believes they, like all of humanity,
are irredeemable without control from a

253
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:22,910
stronger, more violent, more controlling force.
But after battling Batman, who tells him his

254
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:28,750
Superman wasn't powerful because he dominated
others, but because he uplifted them and

255
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:34,290
realizing Ross lied to him about the people of
Batman's world, Koraku starts to question

256
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:39,910
everything. His whole identity, which was built
on strength, is fractured upon his defeat at the

257
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:46,390
hands of Batman. And in the end, Koraku doesn't
just fight for power, he fights to protect others.

258
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:52,750
He becomes a true Superman, embracing the Ninkyo
Code and helping save Gotham. Yeah, it was a great

259
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:57,870
arc. Allegedly, the rest of the Justice League
went through the same arc. It would have been nice

260
00:25:57,870 --> 00:26:02,430
to actually see that happen, as opposed to just
being told that it happened. Yeah, that's fair. I

261
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:08,530
do think Superman is an inspiring enough figure,
though, whether he's good or evil, to have changed

262
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:12,950
the minds of the other League members with an
inspiring speech or something like that. Just

263
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:20,450
something we didn't see. It was cool to see the way
that this movie grafted your standard anime arc

264
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:26,150
types onto these Justice League characters. You
had Wonder Woman with her Lady Snowblood type arc

265
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:32,590
type. Oh yeah, and Zesha Ko is kind of like a gothic
Lolita type figure. Yeah, Lolita fashion. And

266
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:37,910
Barry was this crazy loose cannon who had
boundless energy, just that crazy anime

267
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:42,550
archetype. Whereas Aquaman was more of your
traditional gangster, but he was a badass. Yeah,

268
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:47,690
their looks totally fit them as well. I really
liked the look of Aquaman and Wonder Woman. The

269
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:53,610
only character I really didn't like the look of was
the Flash. I get that they were trying to go for this

270
00:26:53,610 --> 00:27:00,190
raiding, lightning style design, but I think they
should have done more with what was under his coat,

271
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:05,870
because essentially it was just the Flash suit.
Yeah, they relied too much on his headgear selling

272
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:11,990
his new design. Yeah, exactly. Although I did love
the fact that his tornadoes were able to transport

273
00:27:11,990 --> 00:27:19,990
people across the dimensional space time rift,
because not only does Flash do things like create

274
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:26,390
whirlwind tornadoes, but he also travels through
time. So for him to be that medium through which

275
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:31,770
they traveled was genius, I thought. For sure.
Although he was pretty slow in this movie, yeah. I

276
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:36,170
don't think so. I thought he was pretty fast. He
could barely keep up with the Batmobiles that Red

277
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:40,350
Hood and Red Robin were driving. Well, that's
fair. And actually, you know, they even said

278
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:45,270
themselves, like if this was the real Flash, we
would not have been able to defeat him. So yeah,

279
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:50,950
these versions do seem a little bit depowered in
general, I would say. Except for Aquaman. Holy

280
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:56,770
shit. He was awesome in this movie. They always got
to give Aquaman hydrokinesis when they can't

281
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:00,630
figure out what to do with him, because otherwise
he wouldn't have had much to do in this movie, I

282
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:06,330
think. They just need to give him hydrokinesis in
the comics. Like large scale hydrokinesis like

283
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:12,810
that, not like Mera, but where he's like shifting
tidal waves and stuff. So cool. I agree. What did

284
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:18,380
you think of the look of Superman? It caught me off
guard. I think I was expecting something a little

285
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:23,760
bit more traditional. I guess he was wearing a
robe, but the sunglasses were a little strange.

286
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:29,040
That was a unique choice. I actually thought they
were really cool. I'm glad that he kind of stuck

287
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:35,020
with a traditional Japanese robe type look with
like a coat over his shoulders that kind of acted

288
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:41,140
like a cape. But the sunglasses for me just like
tipped the whole thing over the edge into Yakuza

289
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:46,780
badass territory. I thought it evoked Superboy a
little bit. Well, I actually thought it evoked

290
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:52,980
Eradicator, just like an evil version of Superman
of sorts. That makes sense. I also really liked the

291
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:59,560
look of Batman in this movie. We didn't really get
the Ninja Batman or Samurai Batman looks that we

292
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:06,420
got in the first movie. But here we did get to see the
full-on advanced tech version of Batman with the

293
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:12,200
holographic displays and transforming vehicles
and armored suits. It's awesome. I think this is my

294
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,000
favorite version of Batman, the high-tech
version, I should say, because we saw in the first

295
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,840
movie, you know, he had the Batplane that
transformed into the Batmobile, which

296
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:26,180
transformed into the Batbike, which transformed
into a battle suit. Right? That all makes sense to

297
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:32,440
me. I think the most fascinating version of Batman
is not like the Gothic Neo-Norah version, but the

298
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,760
one that's most like Iron Man, the one with the vast
amount of resources. Because it makes more sense

299
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:42,540
to me that he would operate in that sort of sci-fi
almost capacity as a billionaire crime fighter

300
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:47,940
who can stand toe-to-toe with the rest of the
Justice League. This is, I think, the most capable

301
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,340
version of Batman that we've probably ever seen.
Yeah, you might be right. I definitely think this

302
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,860
version makes sense in the context of the other
Justice League characters, because otherwise,

303
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:03,700
you know, he can't really contribute as much as the
others. It's cool to see things like the Batmobile

304
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,960
and the Batplane operating as this sort of Voltron
type character. You know, they went with like

305
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,920
Giant Mechaz in the first movie. I'm glad they
avoided that here and decided to go for more of like

306
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:20,920
a separating battle station type approach for the
Bat family. That was great. Yeah, Alfred's

307
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:26,760
animated video that he made of the Bat Phoenix was
one of my favorite things about the movie. Not

308
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:34,220
gonna lie. It just evoked old classic anime
cartoons like Gundam or Voltron. It was awesome.

309
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:38,260
And there were neat little touches to like the 60s
television show too. Like in the beginning when

310
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:43,060
Batman and Robin slid down their pole into the
Batplane. I loved that. They need to bring things

311
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:49,300
like that back into, you know, the modern mythos. I
want to see like an adaptation of the Bat pole in

312
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:54,840
James Gunn's DCU and maybe even introduce it in
like the Batman. Just as an homage, just because

313
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:59,460
it's like an iconic part of the character that
people know and love so much. Absolutely. And it

314
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:04,960
doesn't even need to be cheesy. Right. Like it
wasn't here. Yeah, exactly. Another thing I

315
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,620
really liked about this version of the Justice
League were the names and origins of each of them.

316
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:17,660
So you have Zeshaqa the Emerald Ray. She was this
gambler who found herself in trouble and while on

317
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:23,460
the run she stumbled upon the Power Ring. It was
reminiscent almost of like Alan Scott's origin,

318
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:29,780
which I think worked well for this version of the
character. Yeah, I like how a lot of her energy

319
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:34,680
constructs were like gambling themed. Yeah, it
was either like gambling themed or like teddy

320
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:43,040
bears. It was cute. Now Aquaman was Asa the awkward
dragon, which is super cool because dragons of

321
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:49,040
course are aquatic creatures in eastern
folklore. Now he came from a species of aquatic

322
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:55,440
people living at the bottom of Lake Inokashira,
which is a real lake in Tokyo. And his mother, the

323
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,420
queen, fell in love with a yuck as a gangster. I
thought that was awesome. Yeah, that was a great

324
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:06,280
play on his standard origin. My favorite use of
Aquaman's powers in this movie was when he sent the

325
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:11,560
sea turtle out to send a message to Wonder Woman.
And then like she responded and like the sea turtle

326
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:16,520
literally like spun away back to the lake. I
thought that was great. It almost reminded me of

327
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:21,720
something like out of a Miyazaki film, just how
surreal it was. Yeah, exactly. Of course, Wonder

328
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:29,360
Woman in this film was Diana the Eagle Goddess. She
was raised in Yoga Gashima, an island of women in

329
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,360
Lake Inokashira. And she was a descendant of the
gods apparently, bestowed with a portion of

330
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:41,760
Benzaiten's power in order to protect Japan and
the Ninkyo spirit. And Benzaiten is like an

331
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,660
eastern goddess. Oh, you know the seven drunk gods
like that Kung Fu martial art style? Yeah.

332
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:53,920
Benzaiten is the Japanese name of the girl god.
Okay. She's like a warrior. Bodhi, the fleet of

333
00:32:53,920 --> 00:33:00,400
foot was a low level Yakuza thug that was struck by
lightning. Well, in a hot spring. That's kind of

334
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:06,240
funny. So good. And the coolest one I thought,
Kuraku, the man of steel, who instead of landing in

335
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:13,340
America, landed in Japan and was raised by a Yakuza
family. Very reminiscent of Red Sun. To touch on

336
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:19,740
the final character, Russell Ghoul, I am glad that
he was the primary antagonist in this film. I

337
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:24,260
forgot that he was going to be because I forgot that
he was in the trailers for this movie. With his

338
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:29,960
resources and his League of Assassins, he's
always kind of been Batman's most formidable foe,

339
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:36,540
in my opinion, and even more so in this film. And
that he has a Yakuza League of Assassins. And I kind

340
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:43,060
of like the play upon the different League
versions. And he's one of Batman's only rogues, I

341
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:48,200
would say, that like wants to destroy all of
humanity as opposed to just causing chaos in

342
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:54,500
Gotham City. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. He's an eco
terrorist, right? So he's always trying to end the

343
00:33:54,500 --> 00:34:00,880
human race. And this was a pretty wild plan to do
just that, even though I'm left wondering, like,

344
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,940
why he couldn't simply just use the engine that he
rebuilt to create a world he had always wanted to

345
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:13,949
see. Like, why not create that instead of create a
Yakuza world to conquer his native world? That

346
00:34:13,949 --> 00:34:18,540
seems like an extra step that's unnecessary.
Well, well, you know, you can only fold a piece of

347
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:25,860
paper in half seven times. So maybe a world without
humans was just too far removed from standard

348
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:34,620
reality. Interesting. OK. Not sure if I buy it, but
it is in fact an explanation. I also liked how they

349
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:40,219
made it so that like Batman's past time adventure
didn't have cascading ripples through time, like

350
00:34:40,219 --> 00:34:45,280
what I thought was going to be the case. But, you
know, instead, Ross simply improved upon Gorilla

351
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:51,620
God's Quake engine to create a machine capable of
warping space time and therefore reality. That's

352
00:34:51,620 --> 00:35:14,140
an awesome, dangerous power for Ross to have. To

358
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:54,740
Moving on to the story highlights, Bruce Wayne and
his son Damien and Alfred notice something is

359
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:59,460
amiss with the world when they realize, among
other things, that the islands of Japan and the

360
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:04,840
Justice League are missing after their time
traveling adventure to feudal Japan. When they

361
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,980
receive a warning of a Yakuza hurricane
approaching Gotham City, they suit up as Batman

362
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:15,120
and Robin to take on the mysterious Japanese
mobsters who've fallen from the sky. An

363
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:21,180
occurrence they learn has been going on for some
time. Surmising that he and his allies must be time

364
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:26,800
displaced with counterparts from a different
timeline, Batman spots an inverted version of

365
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,890
Japan peeking through a fissure in space-time in
the sky above Gotham and travels with Robin in the

366
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:39,240
Batplane to investigate, leaving Nightwing and
Red Robin to handle the remaining Yakuza. Now, I

367
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:45,560
absolutely loved the James Bond-esque opening
credits scene that also served as a recap to the

368
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:53,240
first film in this movie. It was great. Yeah, they
were kind of going for a Adele kind of vibe with the

369
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:58,060
song. I think didn't quite pull it off. I didn't
love the song, but I do appreciate the effort they

370
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:02,980
put into the opening credits for sure. I figured
you would like that as a James Bond fan. Yeah, I

371
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:07,660
totally did. Now, recognizing that the fissure
has an energy signature similar to that of the

372
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:13,430
Quake engine that sent them through time in the
first film, Batman flies through it to an inverted

373
00:37:13,430 --> 00:37:19,520
Tokyo where they're immediately attacked by
Zesuka, the Emerald Ray. That world's version of

374
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:26,240
the Green Lantern Jessica Cruz and, as of the Aqua
Dragon, a version of Aquaman, both of who work as

375
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,980
enforcers for the Hagenet crime family. With
their plane damaged, Batman and Robin are rescued

376
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:38,440
by Diana, the Eagle Goddess, a version of Wonder
Woman who leads the Amazonia Yakuza family and

377
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:44,760
claims Batman and Robin are under her protection
while in Kichijoji, Tokyo. Harley Quinn, as

378
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:51,680
Harren the Wild Jester, aids Diana and Asa and
Zesuka leave. Meanwhile, Nightwing, Red Robin,

379
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,780
and Red Hood manage to defeat Barry, the fleet of
foot, a version of Flash, who generated a tornado

380
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:04,240
that allowed him to travel to Gotham. Now, the way
they defeated Flash was kind of bizarre and that

381
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:11,480
Red Hood was able to fire off these smelly
canisters that reminded him of smells of like meat

382
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:17,680
and beer and stuff like that and rice. So he just got
like really hungry because apparently, body is

383
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:24,180
hungry all the time. Yeah, I didn't love that. It
was funny. Did you find it kind of convenient that

384
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:30,500
Batman and Robin had an ally on the Yakuza side of
things? Like if Wonder Woman wasn't this like

385
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:36,020
honorable character, would they have even stood a
chance, I wonder, in defeating the Yakuza League?

386
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:42,390
Oh, interesting. Probably, probably. Because
Batman still had the contingency plans to defeat

387
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:47,460
each member of the Justice League, so why not use
Diana's against her? Although that would have

388
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,740
eventually required him getting back to his
reality, but I still think he could have done that

389
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:57,740
without Diana. If anything, all he needed was
Joker's help. Which was bullshit. We will get to

390
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:04,940
that. Now Diana informs Batman of the Yakuza War,
known as Yakuza Geden, that has overtaken Japan,

391
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:11,160
forcing its citizens to pick family allegiances.
With the death of Dayo, the leader of the Dumuzu

392
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:17,620
family, a version of Doomsday, at the hands of the
Hagenae family leader, Kuraku, the Man of Steel,

393
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:23,180
the Hagenae family is currently the dominant mob,
and one that does not subscribe to the honor system

394
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:30,180
among Yakuza known as the Ninkyo Way, as Diana and
her Amazonae family does. The real world, or

395
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:36,400
Amatsukuni as Japan knows it, appeared in their
sky a month ago, and the Hagenae family wants to

396
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,200
rule it. While beginning repairs on the Bat Plane,
Batman learns that Harin is his world's Harley

397
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:48,660
Quinn, who came to the inverted Japan just before
he did along with the Joker. Thanks to Harley,

398
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:55,300
Diana believes Batman is an Oya-Boon, or leader of
a Bat Cartel. Now I thought it was totally baller

399
00:39:55,300 --> 00:40:02,390
that this version of Superman killed his Doomsday
and not the other way around. Yeah, I thought that

400
00:40:02,390 --> 00:40:07,720
was a little bullshit. Like, why is Doomsday
leading a family? I feel like the character is not

401
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:13,180
smart enough to do that, so I thought it was an
interesting choice of character, for sure. Yeah,

402
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:20,080
a badass choice, like I said. Okay. Hardcore. Now
as Batman attempts to fly back to Gotham, Kuraku

403
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:26,540
appears and captures the Bat Plane, as the Hagenae
Oya-Boon, Ras Al Ghul, ordered him to bring Damien

404
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:33,860
to him. After flinging Robin toward Ras' Yakuza
Tower, Kuraku nearly kills Batman until Joker and

405
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:40,000
Harley Quinn interfere on a makeshift plane.
While Harley distracts Kuraku, Joker straps his

406
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,740
high-powered ejector seat to the Bat Plane and
shoots him into Gotham, claiming he doesn't want

407
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:52,890
Kuraku to kill Batman. While Diana rescues Harley
from Kuraku, Batman reunites with Nightwing, Red

408
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:58,900
Hood, and Red Robin. And you're right, the Joker
moment was bullshit. It was dumb, and even Batman

409
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:03,680
admitted it. I was also really glad though that
Joker didn't reappear back in the story, because I

410
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,520
guess I was anticipating that, and I thought it
would have been unnecessary. So while I

411
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:14,000
appreciate that they didn't bring the Joker back,
it did leave a bit of a plot hole. Yeah, honestly, I

412
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:20,260
thought the Joker was going to return, and I
thought that Batman is going to use the villains

413
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:24,960
from the first movie to help defeat the Yakuza
League. I don't know why I got that impression

414
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,890
initially. That would have been cool. Yeah, it
didn't end up happening. It turns out all he needed

415
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:36,260
was his own Bat Family to take him on. Now Robin is
taken before his grandfather, Ras Al Ghul, who

416
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:41,520
explains that he's improved upon Gorilla Grodd's
time-traveling Quake engine, creating what he

417
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:48,020
calls a four-dimensional origami system capable
of reshaping space-time itself. Ras reveals that

418
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:54,480
he used it to create new realities by folding
space-time like origami to create a new world of

419
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:01,640
Yakuza assassins under his control, capable of
wiping out humanity on a Metsukuni and allowing

420
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:08,400
Robin, his desired successor, to rebuild it to his
liking. Robin refuses and becomes trapped in a

421
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:15,160
sushi claw machine. So random. Pretty random. I
thought it was funny how he just ordered

422
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,620
California rolls because that was the sushi he was
most familiar with, and Ras Al Ghul called him out

423
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:24,520
for that. I thought that was almost kind of an
insult to Damien. I feel like Damien has better

424
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:30,680
taste than that. I could be wrong. Well, he's
young. Who knows? That's fair. Now in the Batcave,

425
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:35,020
Batman explains that bringing down the Yakuza
League should be simple as they know their

426
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:40,390
weaknesses, and thanks to being exposed to a
space-time pulse from the Quake engine in their

427
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:46,480
prior adventure into the past, they can see and
travel to the inverted Japan through the fissure

428
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,980
and space-time with whatever tech they possess.
Before Batman and his allies prepare for their

429
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:58,100
trip back to Japan, Alfred shows them a video he
made for them using a new batship known as the Bat

430
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:04,180
Phoenix that can separate into smaller ships that
each of them can control individually. Meanwhile

431
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:11,060
in Japan, Ras and Kuraku discuss bringing down
Diana and the Amazon family before conquering a

432
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:17,850
Metsukuni, which Ras has led Kuraku to believe is
full of Yakuza. While Diana nurses Harley back to

433
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:24,280
health, she is visited by a giant turtle messenger
from Asa, challenging her to a duel. After

434
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:30,260
accepting the challenge, Diana begins to sing
about her feelings, karaoke style, awakening

435
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:36,140
Harley, who is invited to sing but is quickly
stopped when she sings horribly. Again, another

436
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:43,960
random absurdist moment, but honestly, I was
laughing. I laughed too. It was strange in that a

437
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:51,180
lot of the story elements to this movie seem to try
to cram as many Japanese customs as possible, kind

438
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:56,340
of randomly, like the sushi thing, like the claw
game, like this karaoke part. Yeah, I always

439
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:02,640
wonder if the Japanese creators of these films is
just trying to expose Western audiences to as many

440
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,960
Japanese things as possible. Yeah, that's what it
felt like. One thing I didn't like about this movie

441
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:16,520
was how easy it was for Batman to defeat the Justice
League. Yeah. Saying to the others that, oh, it's

442
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:22,620
going to be easy to bring these guys down, and then
as you watch the film progress, yeah, he was right.

443
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:29,220
It kind of ruins the whole versus aspect of this
movie to me. Now, granted, the stakes are still

444
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:34,280
huge because of what happens later on with the
potential destruction of Gotham, but that threat

445
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:39,040
wasn't because of the Justice League, and I
thought it would be. Yeah, Batman should never say

446
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,860
that it's going to be easy to take down the Justice
League. It should always be difficult. We've seen

447
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:47,740
him do it before in stories like Tower of Babel,
which was adapted into Justice League Doom, but

448
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:53,640
that felt earned. It's never fun to see Batman go
into, like, God Bode, you know, where he could just

449
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:59,540
defeat all these other characters. Actually, I
mean, it probably is fun to see that. It actually is

450
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:04,440
really cool. But yeah, it just, it was different
from what I thought it was going to be. That doesn't

451
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:10,480
mean it was bad, but the title of the film sets up a
premise that wasn't as satisfying as maybe it

452
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,880
could have been. Now, Asa and Diana meet on Lake
Inokishira, where it's revealed that they used to

453
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:21,060
play together as children. As the two battle,
Zeshika intervenes, holding members of the

454
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:27,480
Amazon family hostage. Harley joins the fight,
battling Zeshika, who is suddenly rammed by the

455
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:33,540
Bat Phoenix. The ship separates with Nightwing
taking on Zeshika, Batman helping Diana against

456
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:40,240
Asa, and Red Robin and Red Hood assigned to Rasa's
Yakuza Tower, where Kuraku rallies Yakuza troops

457
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:46,560
to conquer a Masukuni. Nightwing brings down
Zeshika with the science ninja technique, Decoy

458
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:52,740
Body, tricking her into thinking he was inside a
Sentai-esque suit of armor before shooting her

459
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:58,860
with a sleeping dirt. Which was bizarre. Like, I
don't know when he switched out of the suit. It

460
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:02,920
might have been when, like, she caused a whole
bunch of smoke to come up. I've seen this film

461
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:09,100
twice, and that has to be the moment, but still, it
was unexpected. I mean, that Decoy Body was pretty

462
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:15,440
down powerful to be just a technological creation
of Batman. You know, if he can create drones as

463
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:20,600
smart and powerful as this, Batman should be
creating these guys all the time. Maybe it's a

464
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:27,620
resources issue. We'll go with that. Now, as Baty
generates a storm to shoot Yakuza into Gotham,

465
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:33,960
Diana helps Batman bring down Asa with the science
ninja technique, Electrolisis, in which Batman

466
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:39,140
trapped him in an electric current underwater,
then uses that electricity to create a chemical

467
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:45,140
reaction that exploded the water around Asa.
After Batman and Nightwing explain to Diana their

468
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:51,020
plan to blow up Rasa's quake engine to dissolve the
dimensional fissure joining their worlds, Robin

469
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:56,740
and Red Hood use the science ninja technique,
Tornado Canceller, using their ship to reverse

470
00:46:56,740 --> 00:47:02,300
the direction of Flash's tornado, then blowing up
the giant Yakuza Gatling cannon. Red Robin

471
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:08,240
activates the Bat Phoenix's cloaking mode before
he and Red Hood detach from it and take to the Tokyo

472
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:13,940
streets, where they're chased by body. They
eventually lure him into a trap they set up in an

473
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:19,320
underground parking garage involving a
treadmill and a holographic projector before Red

474
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:25,420
Hood takes body down using science ninja
technique, Vending Machine, which he hides in a

475
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:30,320
holographic vending machine and shoots body in
the head with a sleeping dart when he tries to buy a

476
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:37,320
drink. Again, they played on his desire for food in
order to defeat him. I know it's really hard to take

477
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:42,540
down a character like the Flash, but I feel like
they didn't have to go quite so ridiculous with it.

478
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:49,540
Well, I think other Flash projects like the Flash
movie established that Barry is always hungry, so

479
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:54,980
maybe they were just borrowing from that. Who
knows? This was the most bizarre take down, I feel

480
00:47:54,980 --> 00:48:00,640
like. Because as Flash was having trouble
catching up with these Bat Phoenix cars, I was

481
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,860
like, what is going on? And then for it to be a
hologram, I was like, okay, well, when did that

482
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:11,000
happen? Kuraku destroys the parking garage, and
though Red Hood and Red Robin try to blow him up,

483
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:17,480
Kuraku nearly kills them before he's plowed into
by Batman's tank car. And Diana saves the boys, all

484
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:23,420
of whom go with Nightwing to Yakuza Tower to find
the Quake engine and Robin, while Batman takes on

485
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:29,080
Kuraku and robotic armor transformed from his
tank. As the two fight within a crater in the

486
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:34,420
street, Kuraku dismantles Batman's armor,
though Batman uses science ninja technique

487
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:41,060
spectral conversion to depower Superman by using
crystals within his dismantled armor to filter

488
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:47,620
the sunlight above them into red solar rays. While
suffering a beatdown from Batman, Kuraku learns

489
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:53,320
that Ross has been lying to him about Amatsukuni
being full of Yakuza and that he's a weak version of

490
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:58,320
the Superman that Batman is familiar with. Though
Kuraku manages to disrupt the spectral

491
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:03,660
conversion filter, Batman knocks him out with a
Kryptonite knuckle duster before leaving to

492
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:09,960
Yakuza Tower to go after Ross. This did serve to
highlight how lame Superman's weaknesses are.

493
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:15,420
What? They're always exploited. It's so easy to
defeat Superman if you have the right tool,

494
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:19,770
otherwise it's impossible. But we've seen this
time and time again where he's either taken out by

495
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:24,600
Red Sun radiation or Kryptonite and I'm just over
it. I was hoping that they would go a different

496
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:30,270
route for this film. It did not bother me at all, I'm
going to be honest. Everything from the battle

497
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:37,420
between Diana and Asa leading up to this battle
between Kuraku and Batman was just balls to the

498
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:43,900
wall action. I loved these fights. I thought they
were really hyperkinetic and really cool. I

499
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:49,600
thought it was pretty absurd that Batman's
dismantled armor just managed to create this net

500
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:58,270
filter of light because it had crystals in it. But
it was also very satisfying to see Batman just beat

501
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:04,860
the shit out of this evil version of Superman. The
dialogue was satisfying and the action was cool,

502
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:10,270
but it was so obvious and therefore there was no
tension because you knew that of course Batman was

503
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:14,240
going to pull out Kryptonite. Well, not
initially. I didn't think he was going to at first,

504
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:19,580
but then once he did, the fireball that was around
his hand, I've never seen it depicted that way. The

505
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:25,900
design again just kind of I feel like saved it.
Yeah, Kryptonite radiation as green flame is

506
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:32,880
pretty badass. At Yakuza Tower, Robin breaks free
from his claw machine. Easily, I add, and joins

507
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:38,000
Diana and Batman in confronting Ross. Ross
removes a space-time converter from his quake

508
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,300
engine, sending its four-dimensional origami
system out of control and causing the inverted

509
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:49,270
Tokyo to breach the dimensional fissure and fall
into a collision course with Gotham. Unable to

510
00:50:49,270 --> 00:50:54,080
return the converter back to the engine as it
phases into other dimensions, Batman deduces

511
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:59,220
that the energy from the space-time pulse their
bodies were exposed to can anchor the engine back

512
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:04,900
in Tokyo, and his crew works to focus their energy
on the machine while Diana prevents Ross from

513
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:10,770
interfering. Meanwhile, as Tokyo emerges with
Amatsukuni, the Yakuza League members become

514
00:51:10,770 --> 00:51:17,080
disoriented by the awareness of their alternate
heroic selves across other realities, and Ross

515
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:22,500
knocks Diana from the tower. There's a little bit
of like flux capacitor mumbo jumbo going on here,

516
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:27,480
but I didn't mind it as much because conceptually
it made sense, which I thought was the most

517
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:34,140
important thing. Yeah, I can't tell you how long it
took me to sort of write out this plot structure and

518
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:39,300
just make sense of everything everyone was
saying. It was not easy. But as I was watching the

519
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:43,860
film for the first time, I wouldn't say that
bothered me because yeah, they do eventually get

520
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:49,380
around to explaining everything that's going on.
Now, as gravity inverts itself around them,

521
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:55,320
Batman chases Ross to get the converter. Ross
blows up the base of Yakuza Tower, detaching it

522
00:51:55,320 --> 00:52:01,920
from Tokyo so it alone can still fall onto Gotham as
a contingency for Batman successfully closing

523
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:09,040
the fissure. As Ross escapes via airplane and as
Tokyo debris plummets toward Gotham, Kuraku,

524
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:15,100
Diana, and the rest of the Yakuza League appear,
holding up the tower and protecting Gotham in an

525
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:22,140
adoption of the Ninkyo spirit, freeing up Batman
to go after Ross upon the cloaked Bat Phoenix.

526
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:27,480
After defeating Ross and recapturing the
converter, Batman races back to the tower and with

527
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:33,200
help from Harley, restores the converter to the
engine. As Tokyo begins returning to its own

528
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:38,840
reality, Batman tells the Yakuza League to return
the tower to their world and destroy the engine

529
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:44,380
there to close the fissure and sever the link
between their worlds. Using the Hagoni

530
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:50,700
technique, rising dragon of valor, the Yakuza
raise the tower and depart Gotham. With the

531
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:55,980
Justice League and Robin's Japanese hairstyle
back, Batman and his allies confirm that their

532
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:01,500
timeline has been restored. In a mid-credits
scene, Robin rejects the Alfred suggestion of

533
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,600
wearing a wig. My favorite part about this end
scene is that when the Justice League characters

534
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:11,520
became their composite selves, their reformed
versions, and they got their new updated

535
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:17,820
costumes, the tattoos that were underneath the
costumes glowed. They're Yakuza tattoos. And

536
00:53:17,820 --> 00:53:25,160
they all had this really awesome look because of
that. Yeah, tattoos are synonymous with Yakuza

537
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:32,140
and crime in East Asian culture. I remember when I
went to Korea, they had to check my entire body for

538
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:38,500
tattoos when I lived there for a time. So yeah, it's
kind of a big deal, maybe not so much anymore, but I

539
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:44,380
loved that the Justice League had those tattoos.
They were pretty sick tattoos too. They were.

540
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:51,060
Yeah, they were really cool. Now, the end credits
for this film, they showcased these real like

541
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:56,980
paper dioramas of like the different origins of
the Yakuza League. I didn't realize those were

542
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:01,940
real when they were showing them throughout the
movie. Really? But yeah, someone actually made

543
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:07,620
those and they're awesome to see on display. Holy
shit. You didn't see that in the end credits? The

544
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:13,100
camera moves around them. Yeah, I thought it was
still animated. No, it's real. Okay. All right,

545
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:18,660
I'll take your word for it. I want them. I would buy
those out of my so much merch from this movie. Oh my

546
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:23,980
gosh. But that brings us to the end of the film. I
really liked it. I know it's not perfect. I know

547
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:31,640
it's probably too absurd for a lot of viewers, but
because it's loaded with absurdist anime fun and

548
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:36,500
hyperkinetic action. And with the sequel
showcasing gorgeous Japanese inspired designs

549
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:42,460
and new takes on fan favorite characters. I think
this is an improvement upon the first film, which

550
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:49,780
we gave three and a half stars. So I'm bumping this
one up to four out of five stars, a fresh rating on

551
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:55,100
Rotten Tomatoes. I think that's a solid rating. I
think the key thing that you mentioned here is that

552
00:54:55,100 --> 00:55:00,440
it's fun. It's a fun movie just like the first film.
And I don't think you even need to really see the

553
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:05,220
first film in order to appreciate the sequel.
Though I do think the first film is worth watching

554
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:10,340
too, because it has a lot more traditional, you
know, feudal Japanese elements. But this one is

555
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:15,200
worth watching for the cool twist on the Justice
League characters. Yeah, that's a great

556
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:20,820
description of this whole movie, I think it's just
cool. Like a lot of Japanese things are. But that

557
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:56,840
does it for this review. AJ9K help close this out.
