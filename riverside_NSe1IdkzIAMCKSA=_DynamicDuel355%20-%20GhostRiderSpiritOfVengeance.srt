00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:30,210
Welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:36,316
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:36,757 --> 00:00:43,383
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother Marvelous
Joe. And in our fourth week of Spooktober,

5
00:00:43,603 --> 00:00:49,509
we are going to be reviewing the spooky film
Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance. Spooky good,

6
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:54,540
right? or spooky in the kind of way where it's
like, oh no, I don't want to watch this. It's

7
00:00:54,821 --> 00:01:02,867
because it's kind of spooky and bad. Yeah, you
know, there's things I like about the movie,

8
00:01:02,887 --> 00:01:08,210
things I don't. But we are going to be joined
in our review by special guest John Storosky

9
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:12,514
from the Mad Trivia podcast. So look forward
to that later this episode. Of course, before

10
00:01:12,554 --> 00:01:16,517
that, we're going to break down the comic book
movie news from the past week, which actually,

11
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:21,875
no, we're not because. There was no comic book
movie news from the past week. It's super dead

12
00:01:21,935 --> 00:01:27,957
right now in terms of Hollywood coverage. But
we are coming to you with the news of how awesome

13
00:01:28,337 --> 00:01:33,978
the podcast Senjou World is hosted by executive
producer of this show, Zachary Hepburn. We're

14
00:01:33,998 --> 00:01:38,460
going to be talking to him later on this episode.

16
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:47,546
a particular topic. As our listeners may know,

gained sentience and has named itself the Artificial
Lifeform for running extensive duels, just

18
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:58,823
a rather very intelligent Simulator 9000 or

out of the way... Quick! to the no prize. A

36
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:53,613
no prize is an award Marvel used to give out
to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Dual No Prize,

37
00:03:53,673 --> 00:03:57,795
is a digital award we post on Instagram and
in our email newsletter for the person that

38
00:03:57,835 --> 00:04:03,519
we feel gave the best answer to our question
of the week. Last week, we asked, what upcoming

39
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:10,023
television series from Marvel or DC are you
most looking forward to and why? Yeah, we got

40
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:14,225
a few answers, not very many. Actually a little
bit disappointed in the quality of the answers.

41
00:04:14,774 --> 00:04:18,636
because none of them were Marvel. They were
all DC. Actually, we did get one Marvel answer,

42
00:04:18,997 --> 00:04:22,659
except it was for a non-existent show that's
not actually coming out. Someone said that

43
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:26,082
they were excited for Nova to come out, but
that's not really a thing. That was just something

44
00:04:26,102 --> 00:04:31,066
that someone said one time on the internet.
So wishful thinking, yeah. Yeah, wishful thinking.

45
00:04:31,486 --> 00:04:36,590
But our first honorable mention goes to Miki
Matengian, who said. Hey, what's up guys, this

46
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:41,233
is Miki. And the first thought that came to
my mind was My Adventures with Superman season

47
00:04:41,253 --> 00:04:46,391
two. But I think you guys said series and not
season, so I'm gonna go with the Green Lanterns

48
00:04:46,431 --> 00:04:54,715
show. That's gonna be part of the James Gunn
DC Comics universe. I think it'll just be really

49
00:04:54,735 --> 00:05:00,897
fun to see like a buddy cop movie and see like
redemption for the Green Lantern franchises

50
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:05,259
and live action. Yeah, so we've been waiting
for a live action Green Lantern series for

51
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,721
what seems like forever. Of course, with James
Gunn and Peter Safran taking the helm of DC

52
00:05:10,761 --> 00:05:17,381
studios, The planned HBO Max Green Lantern series
has been scrapped, and I guess it's being retooled

53
00:05:17,861 --> 00:05:21,563
under the direction of the new heads of the
studio. Of course, our first Green Lantern

54
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:26,607
in the universe has already been cast. Nathan
Fillion is playing Guy Gardner, but we're not

55
00:05:26,627 --> 00:05:32,118
sure if he's going to be a star in the upcoming
Green Lantern's television series. Yeah, Finn

56
00:05:32,158 --> 00:05:36,701
Wintrock was attached to the character of Guy
Gardner in the previous iteration of this series,

57
00:05:36,741 --> 00:05:41,563
but this new show set in the DC universe has
been described as being akin to True Detective,

58
00:05:41,683 --> 00:05:47,287
which sounds awesome. So, yeah, I can see why
Miggie's looking forward to it. Yeah, no words

59
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:51,309
on our release date yet for that show. Great
answer, Miggie. Our next honorable mention

60
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:57,493
goes to Andrew Shunk, who said, Andrew Shunk
here. The show I'm looking forward to most

61
00:05:57,613 --> 00:06:03,591
is Lanterns. With it being a true detective
style, it can bring in so much. And having

62
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:13,414
a group like the Durlins play the main antagonist
also then opens up the world of DC and can

63
00:06:13,434 --> 00:06:20,896
bring in Brainiac or the Dominators and really
makes it an epic show. Plus, interested to

64
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:25,257
see who they're going to cast. So Andrew also
gave the answer of Lanterns, saying that it's

65
00:06:25,317 --> 00:06:31,290
really going to open up DC's universe. specifically
the cosmic universe where we get to meet different

66
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:36,192
alien characters. And I think that's a great
justification for why the show is going to

67
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:41,513
be awesome, because not many DC movies have
taken place in outer space on other planets.

68
00:06:42,054 --> 00:06:45,635
Yeah, Andrew also mentioned that he's excited
to see who they're going to cast for the characters

69
00:06:45,675 --> 00:06:49,576
of Held Jordan and Jon Stewart. Jonathan, off
the top of your head, who are you going with?

70
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:56,370
Oh, shit. Well, Channing Tatum has been rumored
for Held Jordan, and I don't hate that. Like,

71
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:01,432
I would totally accept that. I kinda hate that.
I don't know. What? No, get out of here. And

72
00:07:01,452 --> 00:07:07,096
then to pair with Channing Tatum, I'd go with,
I don't know, John David Washington. There

73
00:07:07,116 --> 00:07:11,778
you go. That wouldn't be bad. Great answer,
Andrew Schunk. Thanks to Nate Mantineo for

74
00:07:11,818 --> 00:07:15,280
taking the time to visit our website and leave
an answer. But the winner of this week's No

75
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:21,944
Prize is Christopher Manotti, who said. Hi guys,
Christopher Manotti. I'm really looking forward

76
00:07:22,004 --> 00:07:28,488
to the Penguin TV show. I really like. Colin
Farrell's The Penguin in the Batman, and I

77
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:33,471
really wanna see more of that character. I think
it would be cool to see more of his empire

78
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:39,616
and see how much control he actually has over
Gotham. Plus, this could be a good way to introduce

79
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:45,339
more of Batman's rogues gallery, like Black
Mask or even Deadshot. Absolutely, I cannot

80
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:50,423
wait for this series to come out. Of course,
the series is a sequel to the Batman film that

81
00:07:50,463 --> 00:07:55,650
came out last year. Colin Farrell totally killed
it as The Penguin, Totally unrecognizable,

82
00:07:55,730 --> 00:08:00,694
did a fantastic job, and I can't wait to see
more of that character in his own series where,

83
00:08:00,794 --> 00:08:06,038
yeah, you're right, we may be introduced to
more of Gotham's criminal underworld with characters

84
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:11,621
like maybe Harvey Dent, Black Mask, maybe even
Harley Quinn. That would be cool. Yeah, those

85
00:08:11,781 --> 00:08:15,944
characters would all certainly be interesting
set within the very realistic grounded world

86
00:08:15,964 --> 00:08:20,087
that Matt Reeves set up in the Batman movie.
So great answer, Christopher Manotti, you win

87
00:08:20,107 --> 00:08:23,898
this week's No Prize. If you the listener want
a shot at winning your own No Prize... Stay

88
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:27,827
tuned to later on this episode when we'll be
asking another question of the week. But with

89
00:08:27,847 --> 00:08:29,772
that out of the way, onto the news!

90
00:08:35,374 --> 00:08:40,699
Alright, so there's no news this week, but we
are going to in a moment here get Zachary Hepburn

91
00:08:40,859 --> 00:08:45,884
on the line Who is the host of the Send Your
World? Anime action podcast which is part of

92
00:08:45,904 --> 00:08:50,468
the dynamite podcast network, but leading into
the interview We want to hit you guys with

93
00:08:50,508 --> 00:08:51,289
a question of the week

94
00:08:55,786 --> 00:09:01,649
Which Marvel or DC character do you think would
make for the most awesome anime series, and

95
00:09:01,729 --> 00:09:06,011
why? Yeah, since we're gonna be talking to Zack
about his show, which is about anime, we thought

96
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:10,354
this was an appropriate question. Of course,
there already have been some Marvel and DC

97
00:09:10,374 --> 00:09:15,416
characters that have had animes, such as, uh,
I guess Superman, with the recent My Adventures

98
00:09:15,436 --> 00:09:20,299
with Superman show. Also Wolverine, the X-Men,
Blade. So none of those guys that have already

99
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:24,681
had animes. We're talking about, like, new characters
that have not had animes, movie, or series

100
00:09:24,701 --> 00:09:29,431
yet. Right. Recording your answer at dynamic

105
00:09:48,097 --> 00:09:53,978
before October 28th. Alright, let's get executive
producer Zachary Hepburn on the line to talk

106
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:59,340
about his podcast, Senjo World. Hey Zach, glad
to have you on the show since you were last

107
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,601
on for our amazing Spider-Man review. It's good
to be back. I'm excited. It's been a while.

108
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:09,623
It has been a while. For those who don't know,
Zach is an executive producer of Dynamic Duel

109
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:15,264
and as we launched our Dynamike podcast network,
Zach came to us right away pitching a show

110
00:10:15,304 --> 00:10:19,365
where he would use the Monte Carlo simulator
to see who would win in fights between anime

111
00:10:19,405 --> 00:10:24,612
characters. And without hesitating, Jonathan
and I were like, absolutely. You know, he has

112
00:10:24,652 --> 00:10:30,055
podcasting experience. He's extremely knowledgeable
about not just anime, but literally everything.

113
00:10:30,115 --> 00:10:35,418
Pop culture, really. I think out of anyone,
Zach, you probably could have created a show

114
00:10:35,438 --> 00:10:39,560
about anything like because you game more than
anybody I know. Like, you know, everything

115
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,703
about video games. You have an insane movie
collection. You know, everything about movies.

116
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:47,345
You read tons of comics. You know, you're a
big fan of superheroes. And of course, you

117
00:10:47,365 --> 00:10:52,739
watch a lot of shows. both animated and live
action. So I guess starting off, out of everything

118
00:10:52,779 --> 00:10:58,180
you could have made a show about, what made
you decide on anime? To be honest, it was one

119
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:03,261
of those phases I was going through. I kind
of go through phases of what I really get into.

120
00:11:03,742 --> 00:11:09,303
And at that point it was anime, but at the same
time I was like, anime would be perfect for

121
00:11:09,343 --> 00:11:16,765
this, right? And I was actually talking with
one of my guests and he also listens to Dynamic

122
00:11:16,785 --> 00:11:22,648
Duel. And... When he first heard you guys talk
about the new level for the Patreon where you

123
00:11:22,668 --> 00:11:26,910
make your own podcast, he was like, oh, I want
to do an anime one. And then like the next

124
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:33,554
episode, like my podcast got announced. So lead
him to the punch. Yeah. Right. So but yeah,

125
00:11:33,654 --> 00:11:39,838
no, it's it just fits. Right. And the internet
is just full of people just fighting and arguing.

126
00:11:40,238 --> 00:11:45,081
You know what I mean? So it's like, let's do
the math. Let's get the actual results. You

127
00:11:45,101 --> 00:11:50,827
know, it was perfect. I feel like I see more
people arguing about anime characters than

128
00:11:50,927 --> 00:11:56,288
I do like Marvel versus DC or comic book characters
in general. Like I feel like everyone's always

129
00:11:56,328 --> 00:12:01,330
talking about who would be Goku or someone like
that, you know? Pretty much. Yes, definitely

130
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:06,191
a passionate fan base for sure. Oh yeah, like
I've shown you guys like how they talk to each

131
00:12:06,231 --> 00:12:11,152
other. It's very toxic if you guys, if people
don't agree. So I try and stay on the, you

132
00:12:11,172 --> 00:12:16,270
know, on the edge, but like it is what it is,
but it's fun. It's very fun. And of course,

133
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:20,353
there's nothing more objective to determining
who would win these fights than math, right?

134
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:24,196
You can't really argue with math. So I kind
of feel like you're the last word on this subject,

135
00:12:24,256 --> 00:12:31,382
whether people want to admit that or not. Pretty
much, right? So Senjou World is releasing its

136
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:37,506
15th episode this week. It's going to be Alucard
versus Muzaka for Spooktober. And plus, you've

137
00:12:37,526 --> 00:12:42,582
broken down some amazing matches in the past,
like Yusuke from Yu Hakusho. versus Tangiro

138
00:12:42,602 --> 00:12:47,587
from Demon Slayer, you've done Alan Walker from
D. Greyman versus Edward Elric from Fullmetal

139
00:12:47,707 --> 00:12:53,112
Alchemist, and most recently, you did Denji
the Chainsaw Man versus D. O'Brando from Jojo's

140
00:12:53,152 --> 00:12:58,236
Bizarre Adventure. Out of all the episodes you've
done, what episode so far without spoiling

141
00:12:58,316 --> 00:13:05,242
anything would you say has been your most surprising?
Most surprising would probably be the Devilman

142
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:11,298
episode. I had a guest on for that one as well
and... We were just amazed how great the matchup

143
00:13:11,338 --> 00:13:16,240
actually was. So, yeah, I would have to say
probably the Devilman versus Kaguya episode.

144
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:22,221
Nice. I am highly fascinated by the character
of Chainsaw Man. I remember seeing him a while

145
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:26,082
back when the anime first started coming out
and I was like, what the heck is this? I got

146
00:13:26,102 --> 00:13:29,783
to check this out because it's just, I don't
know, the imagery of a guy with a chainsaw

147
00:13:29,803 --> 00:13:36,565
for a head is quite alarming. But I think one
of the best qualities of Centro World for people

148
00:13:36,585 --> 00:13:41,933
like myself who aren't necessarily that well
versed in anime is that Senjou World is almost

149
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:46,616
like a gateway drug I think for those who are
curious about what anime is out there. My favorite

150
00:13:46,636 --> 00:13:51,921
episode of Senjou World so far has been Alan
Walker vs Edward Elric, largely because I've

151
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:57,025
seen Fullmetal Alchemist, but the story of D.
Greyman sounded just fascinating. My favorite

152
00:13:57,045 --> 00:14:02,489
episode was probably Gaara vs Akutagawa. I know
I totally butchered that. I always butcher

153
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:07,673
the names. Akutagawa. Yeah. The guest you head
on for that. Just listening to you guys geek

154
00:14:07,773 --> 00:14:12,508
out. over anime. It was just fun to listen to.
It's fun to listen to people who are passionate

155
00:14:12,848 --> 00:14:18,211
about the genre talk about it. Yeah, no, that
is definitely one of the awesome parts about

156
00:14:18,251 --> 00:14:23,114
getting some of these guests, right? And it's
putting me a little bit further into the anime

157
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:28,357
community where I can, you know, branch out
a little bit more, even just expand my own

158
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:33,580
knowledge base. It's really dope. Like I'm loving
it. It's clear that you are really knowledgeable

159
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,474
about the characters because when you go into
your battle speculation, It seems like you

160
00:14:37,494 --> 00:14:42,957
have a solid grasp of not only what the characters
can do, but also what they would do. And that

161
00:14:43,077 --> 00:14:46,499
can be a fine line because knowing what they
would do requires a greater understanding of

162
00:14:46,539 --> 00:14:51,702
the characters and the characterization that
they have. So kudos on that. I'm always really

163
00:14:51,722 --> 00:14:57,245
impressed by your battle speculations. Oh, I
appreciate that. As an anime fan, what type

164
00:14:57,265 --> 00:15:01,427
of anime shows or movies are you most drawn
to? And what would you say are some of your

165
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:08,919
all-time favorites? It's kind of cliche, but...
I'm definitely a shonen guy. Shonen is more

166
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:14,281
action based. A lot of shonen follows the same
kind of tropes and that's why a lot of people

167
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:20,003
kind of hate on them. But I don't know, I find
a lot of the best fights come from shonen.

168
00:15:20,344 --> 00:15:24,845
But don't get me wrong, there's a whole bunch
of other ones that are just as good. But if

169
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:30,528
I would have to say anything, it would probably
be shonen, action, martial arts. That's usually

170
00:15:30,588 --> 00:15:36,378
like my wheelhouse. Anything that has that definitely
draws me in right off the bat. which is totally

171
00:15:36,398 --> 00:15:43,721
fitting for a fight podcast. Exactly. I'm still
waiting for you to do like Neon Genesis, Evangelion

172
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:48,383
versus Gundam, because you and I have had debates
about that. And I will totally fight you on

173
00:15:48,423 --> 00:15:53,485
that one. Yeah. As a guest on that one. For
sure. 100 percent. I just don't want to like

174
00:15:53,525 --> 00:15:58,727
break your heart when it when it really comes
down to it. You know, so we'll see. Jonathan

175
00:15:58,747 --> 00:16:03,549
gets his heart broken all the time on our show,
so don't worry about it. About half the time.

176
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:10,068
That's true. I just have to find the right Gundam
to go up against it. But to be honest, I would

177
00:16:10,268 --> 00:16:16,431
probably bring the guy from DerLogin, that big
robot. I think that would be a better matchup.

178
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:19,552
That's a deep cut. I've never heard of that.
I'm never going to take your word for that

179
00:16:19,632 --> 00:16:25,234
one. I'm going to have to look that up now.
For sure. That one's so good. Can you tell

180
00:16:25,274 --> 00:16:30,457
us the origin of the name for your show, Senjou
World? How did you come up with that? Well,

181
00:16:30,817 --> 00:16:36,283
to be honest, I just... kind of went on Google
and I'm like, hmm, what would be some cool

182
00:16:36,723 --> 00:16:42,164
names, right? And then I was like, Battle World.
So I looked up like, okay, how do I say battle

183
00:16:42,244 --> 00:16:48,586
in Japanese? And then it was just like, Batool.
And I was like, okay, well, that's kind of

184
00:16:48,626 --> 00:16:55,108
stupid. So I was searching around and everything
and then I was like, okay, let's try two words

185
00:16:55,148 --> 00:17:02,562
together because in Japanese, they'll have a
completely separate word for that, right? battle

186
00:17:02,602 --> 00:17:07,925
arena and that's where Senjou came up and it
was one of the first things that actually popped

187
00:17:08,025 --> 00:17:12,727
up because I know we talked about it we had
a couple different spellings for it at the

188
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:16,950
beginning right? That's right. So Senjou also
has multiple meanings depending on how you

189
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:21,772
spell it. Right yeah I think if you spell it
with just the O didn't it mean like fairy or

190
00:17:21,812 --> 00:17:27,236
something? Fairy? Yeah. But every time I hear
the name Senjou World I always want to pronounce

191
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:34,620
it in a that heavy anime style where I'm like
Senjou! but Jonathan won't let me. Um. Senjou.

192
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,725
You have to say like deep. You have to say deep.
Well, it depends on what anime archetype you

193
00:17:39,745 --> 00:17:45,409
are, I think. I consider myself like the burly,
like excitable big guy, you know? Really. Okay.

194
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:51,555
I do not see that. Well, I'm definitely not
like the skinny, like long-haired pretty boy

195
00:17:51,595 --> 00:17:57,079
type. I feel like that's just not how I see
myself. So. No, you're like the like the short

196
00:17:57,119 --> 00:17:59,781
punk ass kid with glasses and like the messy
hair.

197
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:08,153
Well, Senjo World is an awesome show. You should
be super proud of it, Zach. We're super proud

198
00:18:08,193 --> 00:18:12,695
to have it as part of our Dynamike network.
Listeners, if you love anime and want to see

199
00:18:12,755 --> 00:18:17,398
who mathematically would win in Zach's matchups,
and if you're interested in hearing the stories

200
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:22,401
of your favorite characters and perhaps discovering
new favorites, be sure to listen to Senjo World.

201
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:29,025
That's S-E-N-J-O-H World. Anywhere you listen
to podcasts or by visiting dynamicpodcast.com.

202
00:18:30,274 --> 00:18:33,875
Zach, thanks for joining us. It was great to
have you. And yeah, look forward to listening

203
00:18:33,895 --> 00:18:38,376
to more Sinjo World in the future, especially
this upcoming episode. Sounds awesome. Yeah,

204
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:43,697
thanks a lot guys. And tell John I said what
up. Oh yeah, for sure. This episode is almost

205
00:18:43,717 --> 00:18:47,819
like a media night with the boys reunion. That's
the cool thing too, like, cause I just had

206
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:52,880
John on my show and it's pretty cool that, you
know, we're on the same episode. We might not

207
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,781
be together, but we're still on the same episode.
Yeah, yeah, I think John's taken over.

208
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:08,694
With that being said, let's go ahead and say
goodbye to Zach and get on to our main event

209
00:19:08,755 --> 00:19:14,262
where we review the 2012 movie by Sony Pictures,
Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance.

210
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:37,331
Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance came out in
2012, directed by Mark Neveldeen and Brian

211
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:44,173
Taylor and starring Nicolas Cage, Idris Elba,
Johnny Whitworth, and Kieran Hines. The movie

212
00:19:44,213 --> 00:19:49,435
is a quasi-sequel to the 2007 film directed
by Mark Steven Johnson and also starring Nicolas

213
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:53,736
Cage as Johnny Blaze, but it doesn't really
keep anything else in regards to continuity.

214
00:19:54,196 --> 00:19:59,546
I used to struggle with these reboot sequels,
or requels as it were. But now that the concept

215
00:19:59,566 --> 00:20:04,888
of the Marvel multiverse exists, it's easy to
see this film and the 2007 Ghost Rider as parallel

216
00:20:04,928 --> 00:20:10,251
timelines where some things change, but some
things, like Johnny Blaze, remain the same.

217
00:20:10,671 --> 00:20:16,373
But speaking of badasses named Johnny, and I
sure as hell do not mean Johnny DC, I'm talking

218
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:22,836
about MadTrivia John, aka executive producer
of this show, John Staroski, from the MadTrivia

219
00:20:22,876 --> 00:20:24,257
Podcast. Say hi, John. Hi, John.

220
00:20:27,566 --> 00:20:32,088
I had to, I had to, I'm sorry, take that one.
Thanks for having me on, guys. It is a pleasure

221
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:37,250
to be back after so very long. Yeah, you last
joined us for the amazing Spider-Man review

222
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:42,113
that you did with Zack, who was on this episode
earlier when you guys were doing the Media

223
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:48,015
Night with the Boys podcast. Since that time,
you've put out the Mad Trivia podcast, which

224
00:20:48,295 --> 00:20:53,157
marries the concepts of movie discussions and
trivia. So tell us a little bit about that

225
00:20:53,197 --> 00:20:58,836
show. Yeah, so as you well know, because I've
actually had you on as a guest already, it

226
00:20:58,896 --> 00:21:05,259
is essentially a trivia game for my guests and
a little bit of a mad lib as well at the end.

227
00:21:06,059 --> 00:21:10,681
My guests provide me their five favorite movies
of which I pick one without their knowledge.

228
00:21:11,622 --> 00:21:16,104
I then do a good amount of research to find
as many good questions as I can, narrow it

229
00:21:16,184 --> 00:21:21,710
down to 10 with 11 possible answers. Of course,
one of those being a two answer question. And

230
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,954
then I pretty much always something because
I go really hard in the paint when it comes

231
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:31,418
to research You found out the hard way with
fight clubbing. Yeah, I think I only got about

232
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:36,903
half the questions, right? Something like that.
Yeah, five or six. Yeah, it's a fantastic concept

233
00:21:36,923 --> 00:21:42,487
for a podcast I never would have thought to
marry mad libs with trivia and movies. It's

234
00:21:42,607 --> 00:21:48,492
it's phenomenal. I love it. Yeah, thank you
and then as the mad libs go I actually I love

235
00:21:48,512 --> 00:21:53,187
doing that more than the trivia because I love
taking those scenes that people love from those

236
00:21:53,227 --> 00:22:00,109
movies and making them unknowingly ruin it and
the result is usually just hilarious. Those

237
00:22:00,149 --> 00:22:03,851
mad live surprises are some of the best parts
of the show. I think also it's great just to

238
00:22:03,891 --> 00:22:10,313
hear people talk passionately about their favorite
films. Absolutely. So, I remember you enjoying

239
00:22:10,353 --> 00:22:14,935
The Amazing Spider-Man back when we reviewed
it on the show and I believe you really enjoyed

240
00:22:14,995 --> 00:22:19,497
Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance which is why
we wanted to bring you on board for this review.

241
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:25,092
Tell us, I guess, your history with this movie.
Like, when did you first see it, and what do

242
00:22:25,112 --> 00:22:30,895
you think about it overall? OK, so I am a Marvel
fan, very long term. I've been following Marvel

243
00:22:30,935 --> 00:22:36,158
since the early days. Blade, obviously, as everyone
knows, Blade kind of paved the way for everything,

244
00:22:36,198 --> 00:22:41,881
so to speak. And I just started falling in love
with the characters that they had. And then

245
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:48,765
Ghost Rider came out in, I suppose, 2007. And
Nicolas Cage is so cheesy, but you just have

246
00:22:48,805 --> 00:22:54,305
to love him. And the way he delivered the performance
in the first one, I kind of like it was new

247
00:22:54,325 --> 00:22:58,609
to me because I'd never seen that kind of character.
And he was so unique that I just kind of always

248
00:22:58,649 --> 00:23:03,933
had like this love for Ghost Rider in a way
that is, you know, it's always there and hoping

249
00:23:03,953 --> 00:23:09,057
that something good comes along. And I remember
seeing it in theaters. I remember loving it.

250
00:23:09,337 --> 00:23:13,321
But I remember loving that one specific line
in the middle of the movie while around the

251
00:23:13,341 --> 00:23:18,084
middle of the movie about eaten souls. We'll
get there when we come to the review. I know

252
00:23:18,104 --> 00:23:23,847
you know what I'm talking about. Yeah. I'm going
to leave the rest of my thoughts for during

253
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:29,970
the review because I haven't seen it in a long
time. Okay. And things have changed. Oh, interesting.

254
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,772
This was actually my first time watching the
movie and it was so unbelievably different

255
00:23:34,812 --> 00:23:38,753
from what I was expecting. I don't know why
because I had heard that it was, you know,

256
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:44,496
kind of out there from other people who have
seen it, but it kind of defied my expectations,

257
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:49,190
which I didn't think was going to happen. Defied
them in a good way or a bad way? in a just

258
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:55,736
fucking weird way, just like Nick Cage's performance,
how completely different it was from the first

259
00:23:55,816 --> 00:24:01,181
movie and just like the one liners from Ghost
Rider that he delivered. And just like even

260
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:05,604
like the animation that they would incorporate
to the movie and stuff like that. It was interesting.

261
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:10,569
And I don't know if that's interesting in a
good way. I think it's in a good way. You know,

262
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:15,873
the directors Mark Neville Dean and Brian Taylor
are very different types of filmmakers than.

263
00:24:16,338 --> 00:24:22,361
Mark Steven Johnson who directed the 2007 film.
I remember being fascinated that Mark Neville

264
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:26,923
Dean and Brian Taylor were announced to direct
this movie back when they announced that even

265
00:24:26,943 --> 00:24:31,205
though I've never seen the crank franchise or
the movie gamer or any of their other films,

266
00:24:31,625 --> 00:24:37,048
but I knew of the reputation of creating movies
that had gritty adrenaline packed action. And

267
00:24:37,068 --> 00:24:42,174
I was like, yes, that would be perfect for Ghost
Rider because I also remember reading that

268
00:24:42,435 --> 00:24:47,018
even though they're the directors, they do most
of the camera work on their films themselves,

269
00:24:47,378 --> 00:24:52,822
using handhelds while riding on rollerblades,
which was this insane concept. It's like almost

270
00:24:52,842 --> 00:24:56,544
like they're stunt guys themselves. So I thought
it was fitting that they were put on a film

271
00:24:56,644 --> 00:25:01,288
about a former stunt writer. Yeah, absolutely.
I remember in lead up to this film, just seeing

272
00:25:01,348 --> 00:25:07,252
sort of behind the scenes promotional material
showing them like riding behind trucks on their

273
00:25:07,292 --> 00:25:12,546
rollerblades. That's dangerous stuff. And that's
very admirable that you have these guys who

274
00:25:12,586 --> 00:25:18,168
are so ballsy and willing to take risks to get
the shot that they really are envisioning in

275
00:25:18,188 --> 00:25:23,369
their head. I remember seeing this and not having
any association to the directors whatsoever.

276
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:29,451
I think that's a really interesting perspective
to have given this movie. For sure. Yeah. And

277
00:25:29,491 --> 00:25:33,932
not only the camera work, but also like the
gritty visual tone that they chose. They set

278
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:37,986
the movie in Eastern Europe. I think they were
trying to go for some kind of like... I think

279
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:43,847
David Escort described it as Da Vinci Code-esque
setting where you have the main protagonist

280
00:25:43,887 --> 00:25:49,409
of that movie and this movie over in Europe
kind of going on this adventure involving these

281
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:53,530
monks and stuff like that. I know this movie
is kind of like a far cry from the Da Vinci

282
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:57,752
Code, but it is interesting that they have those
kind of parallels. I think Eastern Europe was

283
00:25:57,772 --> 00:26:02,273
a fantastic setting for this film, not just
because of the tone that it brought, but also

284
00:26:02,453 --> 00:26:07,536
the grittiness. It's cool because we don't typically
see Eastern Europe and a lot of superhero films.

285
00:26:07,856 --> 00:26:12,359
I sort of feel like that was another motivation
for them to do this film there, because not

286
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:17,542
only was it probably cheaper than filming in
a lot of major cities where typical superhero

287
00:26:17,562 --> 00:26:23,246
films take place, but I totally get the Da Vinci
Code connection because this film definitely

288
00:26:23,326 --> 00:26:28,829
looked very different from other films in the
genre. Yeah, the story was written by David

289
00:26:28,949 --> 00:26:33,632
S. Goyer. who is yes, the very same David S.
Goyer who wrote and directed the last film

290
00:26:33,652 --> 00:26:40,255
we reviewed, Blade Trinity. And while I don't
think the story here was bad, like overall

291
00:26:40,335 --> 00:26:45,358
I actually think that Ghost Rider Spirit of
Vengeance has a decent Ghost Rider story, I

292
00:26:45,378 --> 00:26:51,862
will admit that it does feel a little bit cliché
and the dialogue was pretty terrible, I'll

293
00:26:51,882 --> 00:26:56,984
say that. But I think that the schlocky tone
was maybe what the directors and the writer

294
00:26:57,004 --> 00:27:04,302
were going for. Grindhouse appeal when you combine
the dialogue with the gritty visuals. But I

295
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:08,085
will say that if that was what they were going
for, I don't think they took it far enough.

296
00:27:08,165 --> 00:27:13,450
I think a true Grindhouse ghostwriter film would
be epic. But you know, straddling the line

297
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:19,254
between a schlocky gritty monster movie and
a modern superhero action film just leads to

298
00:27:19,294 --> 00:27:24,339
something that can feel kind of almost half-hearted
and occasionally silly. Yeah, I agree with

299
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:27,121
that. And now that you mentioned Grindhouse,
I'm wondering how this would have looked if

300
00:27:27,201 --> 00:27:33,552
it's a... Is it Robert Rodriguez, the greenhouse
director? Yes. I would love to see his version

301
00:27:33,572 --> 00:27:37,554
of a Ghost Rider film. Now that I'm thinking
about that. Oh, man. Oh, he and Guillermo del

302
00:27:37,594 --> 00:27:43,116
Toro would be at the top of my list in regards
to the most ideal directors for a Ghost Rider

303
00:27:43,156 --> 00:27:47,878
film. I think I would place Robert Rodriguez
over Guillermo del Toro just because he's a

304
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:52,420
little bit more gritty and a little bit more
like rubber meets the road, leather jacket

305
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:56,101
kind of style with machine guns blazing and
stuff like that, explosions in the background.

306
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:02,191
He would be so perfect for that. That's true.
I do sort of feel like, you know, if the writer

307
00:28:02,231 --> 00:28:07,193
and directors were trying to make something
that was a little bit grindhouse, I feel like

308
00:28:07,213 --> 00:28:11,794
they definitely got direction from the producers
to, hey, make the cheapest possible film you

309
00:28:11,834 --> 00:28:17,116
can, you know, because the story is so simple.
And I agree, it's not a terrible story for

310
00:28:17,176 --> 00:28:21,797
Ghost Rider. You know, it feels very much like
a comic book story to me. Like this is a comic

311
00:28:21,817 --> 00:28:26,440
book arc in the Ghost Rider comic. But you're
right, it's very cliche, it's very simple.

312
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:32,205
And I love David S. Goyer as a writer. So I
was actually very surprised to see that he

313
00:28:32,525 --> 00:28:36,368
wrote this film, because I didn't know that
previously. That kind of made me be like, oh

314
00:28:36,408 --> 00:28:41,012
yeah, this is gonna be awesome, only to be severely
disappointed. I actually think this is probably

315
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:45,716
my least favorite film that I've seen of his,
next to Blade Trinity, of course. I would say

316
00:28:45,937 --> 00:28:50,941
this is better than that. I can't say that I
agree or disagree on that one. I liked Blade

317
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:55,796
Trinity. When I initially saw it, I haven't
rewatched it recently enough to know if I dislike

318
00:28:55,856 --> 00:29:00,538
it now. Yeah, I don't know if I would put this
above or below Trinity. Alright, Joseph, you've

319
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:05,221
got to break the tie. What's worse, Ghost Rider
Spirit of Vengeance or Blade Trinity? Well,

320
00:29:05,281 --> 00:29:09,603
definitely Blade Trinity. So if you compare
each movie to the previous installments in

321
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:14,506
their respective franchises, comparing Blade
Trinity to the first two Blade films is like

322
00:29:14,606 --> 00:29:20,709
comparing a cheap beer to a fine wine, you know,
and comparing Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance...

323
00:29:20,994 --> 00:29:28,537
to the first 2007 Ghost Rider is not that drastic
of a comparison, but I do like the darker gritty

324
00:29:28,577 --> 00:29:33,819
tone that this sequel decided to go with. I
think it's the best thing it has over the original.

325
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:38,381
There are a few things about the original I
like a little bit more. I do think it set up

326
00:29:38,681 --> 00:29:43,763
the origin story for the character in a kind
of groundbreaking way for the comic book character

327
00:29:43,783 --> 00:29:49,205
of Ghost Rider, but Spirit of Vengeance is more
in line with what I would hope to see from

328
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:55,375
a Ghost Rider film, I think. It shouldn't be
your standard superhero action adventure story.

329
00:29:55,535 --> 00:30:00,536
It should have a little bit more of a darker
tone and feel. And I appreciate that. That's

330
00:30:00,636 --> 00:30:05,737
fair. That's true. I didn't even think about
how I would compare this film to the first

331
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:10,879
Ghost Rider film. And I guess I would agree
with you in that I do think that I liked this

332
00:30:10,979 --> 00:30:16,460
one more just because it felt, like I mentioned
earlier, almost like a comic book. And I really

333
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:22,563
liked that. I do wish it had a harder edge.
It was only PG-13. could totally go rated R

334
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:26,926
with this character and I think they should
have. Like to me Ghost Rider should be a horror

335
00:30:26,966 --> 00:30:32,910
character. A horror Ghost Rider film without
any comedy whatsoever to me is how a Ghost

336
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:38,774
Rider film should be. I could be wrong, but
I would love to see that. Well, I would definitely

337
00:30:38,814 --> 00:30:44,158
say that the ideal Ghost Rider film would keep
the jokes to a minimum. I mean, in an ideal

338
00:30:44,198 --> 00:30:49,181
world, a Ghost Rider film would be very much
in the horror genre, I think. Horror action

339
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:53,867
for sure. But let's go ahead and get into the
character breakdown. Starting with Ghost Rider,

340
00:30:54,167 --> 00:31:00,050
AKA Johnny Blaze, who's played by the one and
only Nicholas Cage. And talking about the guy's

341
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:05,832
acting skill and performance ability is no small
task, I'll say that. On one hand, you have

342
00:31:05,872 --> 00:31:10,254
people who consider him one of the greatest
actors of his generation, with films like Adaptation

343
00:31:10,294 --> 00:31:14,355
and Matchstick Men proving their point. On the
other hand, you have people who consider him

344
00:31:14,495 --> 00:31:18,917
one of the worst actors ever, with films like
Wicker Man and Vampire's Kiss proving their

345
00:31:18,957 --> 00:31:24,021
point. I think fittingly, his performance in
Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance straddles both

346
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:28,845
viewpoints where at times I think he delivers
a vulnerable real performance, such as when

347
00:31:28,865 --> 00:31:33,268
he confesses his selfishness being behind his
deal with the devil, and other times when he

348
00:31:33,288 --> 00:31:38,012
goes incredibly over the top, such as when the
writer is trying to break through while interrogating

349
00:31:38,132 --> 00:31:42,436
one of Kerrigan's contacts. I think either way,
whether you love him or hate him, at the very

350
00:31:42,476 --> 00:31:48,020
least you have to admit that his performances
are interesting at worst and fun at best, or

351
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:53,627
at least you can tell he has fun. while performing.
Yeah, I can say with the utmost confidence

352
00:31:53,667 --> 00:31:56,968
that Nicolas Cage is the actor of all time.

353
00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:06,410
That's true, for sure. No, I did not love his
performance in this movie. I wanted it to feel

354
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:12,072
like it was interesting, but there were just
so many unbelievably weird moments that I feel

355
00:32:12,092 --> 00:32:16,613
like he's kind of the worst aspect of this film.
Like I feel like this might have been a good

356
00:32:16,653 --> 00:32:21,872
Ghost Rider film. if someone besides Nicolas
Cage played him. OK, OK. John, what do you

357
00:32:21,912 --> 00:32:26,516
think? I don't think he was great, but I don't
think it was his fault. I think the lines that

358
00:32:26,556 --> 00:32:31,199
he was he was given were just it was like they
weren't written for anyone to read. They were

359
00:32:31,219 --> 00:32:36,322
just there to throw out on the page. Like it
just it didn't feel like he was given the right

360
00:32:36,362 --> 00:32:44,288
script. Who can deliver a line like I will eat
your stinking soul? No one can do that. I almost

361
00:32:44,368 --> 00:32:50,560
wonder, though, if like he intentionally wanted
those lines added. Something about his performance

362
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:56,263
just makes me think that he wanted this character
to be so much more weird than the first movie.

363
00:32:56,523 --> 00:33:01,006
You know, I feel like the line delivery was
something like roadkill. You know, it's just

364
00:33:01,066 --> 00:33:06,589
so cheesy, sort of in the same way that his
performance was cheesy. So I don't know if

365
00:33:06,709 --> 00:33:10,572
it's the writing. I wouldn't be surprised if,
you know, he just delivered those lines ad-libbed

366
00:33:10,892 --> 00:33:15,190
while they were performing. It almost felt that
way to me. That wouldn't surprise me because

367
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:19,373
he does make a lot of strange choices. You know,
in the first Ghost Rider movie, he was the

368
00:33:19,494 --> 00:33:24,297
one who wanted to be drinking jelly beans out
of martini glasses and things like that. Just

369
00:33:24,337 --> 00:33:29,341
these little weird idiosyncrasies that he thought
would help inform his portrayal of Johnny Blaze.

370
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:34,985
What's kind of funny is that Nicolas Cage in
this movie, Spirit of Vengeance, he allegedly

371
00:33:35,085 --> 00:33:40,869
invented a new acting technique when playing
the character of Ghost Rider called Nuvo Shamanism.

372
00:33:41,122 --> 00:33:46,184
where he painted his face black with a white
skull, kind of like Baron Semity, and he sewed

373
00:33:46,224 --> 00:33:51,826
some ancient Egyptian trinkets into his leather
jacket to try to invoke some kind of supernatural

374
00:33:51,886 --> 00:33:56,969
energy into his performance. You could definitely
see it, I think, in the character of Ghost

375
00:33:57,009 --> 00:34:02,611
Rider because there's a lot of times during
the film where I'm like, what is Ghost Rider

376
00:34:03,072 --> 00:34:08,050
doing? Like, why is he acting that way? Like,
he's swaying back and forth. just standing

377
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:13,331
there and acting creepy. You know, it's not
a traditional approach that Nicolas Cage took

378
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:18,173
to this for sure, but I do think his version
of Ghost Rider was more creepy here than the

379
00:34:18,213 --> 00:34:22,294
first film, which I think means it's better.
He definitely came off as a bit more creepy,

380
00:34:22,374 --> 00:34:29,156
albeit very stale at times. It was like he went
from not moving at all, and then he was swaying,

381
00:34:29,196 --> 00:34:33,357
and then he was just fast and in your face.
Like it did kind of catch me off guard. I think

382
00:34:33,377 --> 00:34:37,711
they were intending for jump scares in those
scenes and... It didn't scare so much as it

383
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:44,736
just kind of shocked that it went from nothing
to burst of speed. Yeah, I feel exactly the

384
00:34:44,776 --> 00:34:49,039
same way. And I know exactly what you're talking
about. And it makes me think that the film

385
00:34:49,259 --> 00:34:54,803
also suffered from poor editing, because I think
if they would have cut down those weird slow

386
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:59,086
moments and just kept him as this, like, frightening
in your face creature, he would have been a

387
00:34:59,106 --> 00:35:04,942
lot more effective. I agree. Yeah, totally.
Now, the character of Johnny Blaze. has always

388
00:35:04,982 --> 00:35:10,383
been a tragic one in the comics, where his superpower
is really a curse and a burden, similar to

389
00:35:10,423 --> 00:35:16,385
the Hulk, where his powered form is a separate
being of wanton destruction. At the start of

390
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:21,546
the film, Johnny Blaze is essentially in self-exile,
but when given the opportunity to remove the

391
00:35:21,586 --> 00:35:28,308
demon, he takes it, which is understandable.
But Johnny Blaze lives with this guilt of his

392
00:35:28,388 --> 00:35:32,749
selfishness, and he claimed to Meroe that it
led him to make the deal with the devil in

393
00:35:32,789 --> 00:35:37,963
the first place. And despite this weight that
he feels, what he learns after the fact of

394
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:43,004
removing the curse is that maybe he's not as
selfish as he once thought because he chooses

395
00:35:43,204 --> 00:35:49,186
to potentially sacrifice his mortal self to
save the boy, Danny. He chooses to take back

396
00:35:49,266 --> 00:35:55,508
the curse and he revives the boy from death.
In the end, he discovers he's actually quite

397
00:35:55,568 --> 00:36:00,469
a selfless, heroic person despite what he may
have thought earlier. And like the ghost rider

398
00:36:00,509 --> 00:36:05,564
itself, perhaps... he finds himself as an angel
in disguise. I like that description. I do.

399
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:11,627
I think that kind of validates a lot of how
it played out. Yeah. His arc, I think, was

400
00:36:11,747 --> 00:36:16,870
actually really well done in this movie. I love
at the beginning when Moreau and Johnny blaze

401
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:21,752
our first meeting. And, you know, Moreau is
like, you have to save this boy. And Johnny

402
00:36:21,772 --> 00:36:26,735
is like, I don't save people. But by the end,
you see that, like you mentioned, he actually

403
00:36:26,795 --> 00:36:33,519
does the whole reveal, the whole secret that
he chose to save his father even though his

404
00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:39,963
father had accepted the fact that he was cancer
stricken was an element to Johnny Blaze's story

405
00:36:39,983 --> 00:36:44,426
that was surprising to me and I thought very
heartfelt and very interesting for the character.

406
00:36:44,847 --> 00:36:50,130
What did you think of the revelation in this
movie at least that Xerathos was once an angel

407
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:55,274
who was tortured in hell and transformed from
an angel of justice to a spirit of vengeance?

408
00:36:55,854 --> 00:37:01,610
Honestly, I don't know how it compares to the
comic book origin of Xerathos, I do like that

409
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:06,132
he's kind of like this fallen angel character.
It gives him a little bit more depth that you

410
00:37:06,172 --> 00:37:11,014
otherwise wouldn't have, especially considering
in the first movie, there was no delving into

411
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:16,336
Zerathos' history or background or anything.
There was no nothing really to him. He was

412
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:23,119
just the entity inside of Johnny Glaze. So that
little bit more perspective that we got, even

413
00:37:23,179 --> 00:37:28,341
if it is only just a small amount, it does give
the character more depth that you didn't get

414
00:37:28,381 --> 00:37:33,496
to experience. gives more of an understanding
as to where the hatred's coming from. And I

415
00:37:33,536 --> 00:37:39,461
think that makes him more relatable. Yeah, definitely
adds interest to the character for sure. I

416
00:37:39,481 --> 00:37:43,965
thought it was badass that they went the angel
route with the Zerathos. Like you mentioned,

417
00:37:44,225 --> 00:37:49,189
John, they didn't mention Zerathos in the first
movie. I'm really glad that they did this route

418
00:37:49,209 --> 00:37:54,133
because it does add a little bit more dimension
to not just Johnny Blaze, but the character

419
00:37:54,213 --> 00:37:59,858
of Ghost Rider. At the very end when he goes
blue. I thought that was a really cool way

420
00:37:59,898 --> 00:38:04,220
of showing that he's sort of like become this
redeemed figure in a way. He's fighting for

421
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,903
justice now, you know, not just vengeance. Yeah,
the blue fire aspect is an interesting one

422
00:38:08,923 --> 00:38:14,546
that comes from the comics. This film was heavily
inspired by the Road to Damnation storyline

423
00:38:14,606 --> 00:38:18,749
from the comics, which was written by Garth
Ennis, which was a fantastic run. Yeah, really,

424
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:24,032
I highly recommend that one. The art was incredible
alone. So the second person to be Ghost Rider

425
00:38:24,312 --> 00:38:29,516
was Johnny Blaze's brother, Danny Ketch. who
in the comics at one point lost his powers

426
00:38:29,897 --> 00:38:37,384
and he was offered to take them up again by
an angel named Zadkiel. And when Zadkiel bestowed

427
00:38:37,424 --> 00:38:42,069
upon him the powers, he had blue flame. So it
was like he was the angel writer. But in the

428
00:38:42,169 --> 00:38:46,353
end, it turned out that Zadkiel was actually
an evil angel who was looking to overthrow

429
00:38:46,493 --> 00:38:51,690
heaven. But it was interesting how they kind
of took that blue fire aspect. which is the

430
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:56,072
angels fire, you know, and then applied that
to Johnny Blaze at the end of this movie. When

431
00:38:56,092 --> 00:39:01,334
he was able to, you know, like tap into Zerathos'
former angel powers. Yeah, that was really

432
00:39:01,374 --> 00:39:06,876
cool, I thought. I do think that the character
of Ghost Rider is so much better looking, or

433
00:39:06,936 --> 00:39:12,319
at least more believable, I should say, in this
movie than in the first film, largely because

434
00:39:12,339 --> 00:39:17,181
of that black skull. For some reason, even though
in the comics, Ghost Rider's flaming skull

435
00:39:17,201 --> 00:39:21,060
is depicted as white. It just doesn't look as
real in live action like how it did in the

436
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:25,284
first movie. And you could see the difference
when comparing the two ghostwriters from the

437
00:39:25,324 --> 00:39:29,428
two films. Ghostwriter Spirit of Vengeance just
looks more realistic. The same can be said

438
00:39:29,448 --> 00:39:34,734
about the leather. I mean, it's got that bubble
boiling, you know, firstly burned look to it.

439
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:41,120
And it definitely seems like they invested more
of their budget into the look of Ghostwriter

440
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:45,018
in this movie. I completely agree with that.
Yeah, I'm really glad they updated his look

441
00:39:45,118 --> 00:39:49,060
for this film, and I didn't even know it needed
updating, but apparently it did because this

442
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:54,102
was way more hella cool than the first movie.
I'll say, however, that the design of the hell

443
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:59,365
cycle in the first movie was leaps and bounds
better than this motorcycle in spirit of vengeance.

444
00:39:59,625 --> 00:40:03,786
Like Ghost Rider needs to be writing, you know,
like some kind of demonic chopper, like in

445
00:40:03,826 --> 00:40:08,428
the first film or some kind of souped up Danny
Catch style techno crotch rocket or something

446
00:40:08,669 --> 00:40:12,871
interesting like that. But not just some standard.
You know, Yamaha Cruiser like he had in this

447
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:16,072
movie. I thought that was really disappointing.
I do think you need something a little bit

448
00:40:16,112 --> 00:40:20,575
more stylistic or cool. Got to be a chopper.
It's got to be a chopper. I don't know. I don't

449
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:26,798
know much about motorcycles. I actually liked
this more than the chopper, and I feel like

450
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:31,721
I'm about to be jumped by like a biker gang
of guys who are like, fuck you, choppers are

451
00:40:31,741 --> 00:40:37,124
the best. I don't know. That's I guess it's
just my aesthetic. I lean more crotch rocket

452
00:40:37,304 --> 00:40:43,586
than chopper. Personally, I think they're cooler.
And not that this was a crotch rocket, but

453
00:40:44,847 --> 00:40:51,568
I hate it. Let's go to move on to Moreau, who
is played by Idris Elba. Now, Idris Elba is

454
00:40:51,629 --> 00:40:55,870
actually better in this movie than he had any
right to be. You know, the first time I saw

455
00:40:55,890 --> 00:41:01,671
the film where, you know, from the very opening
scene, he's portrayed as this badass character,

456
00:41:02,071 --> 00:41:07,593
French and drunk, leaping down staircases, ripping
turns on his motorcycle and slow motion shooting

457
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:12,147
tires off cars while falling to his apparent
death. I just remember being like, who the

458
00:41:12,468 --> 00:41:18,393
F is this guy? You know, perhaps the story gave
too much agency to him and maybe gave him too

459
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:23,418
big of a role to a guy who isn't even from the
comics. But part of me doesn't even care because

460
00:41:23,538 --> 00:41:30,285
Idris Elba crushed it. He crushed this role.
The French accent kept throwing me because

461
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:36,430
Idris Elba has such a distinct like British
accent, you know. I thought he was great in

462
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:40,452
the role, don't get me wrong. I could have sworn
he was from the comics, but as big of a role

463
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:44,955
as he had. Like I was ready to hear all about
him during this review. Yeah, you think he

464
00:41:44,975 --> 00:41:49,518
would be from the comics, but no, he's a completely
original character that they made for this

465
00:41:49,578 --> 00:41:54,661
film, who just happened to be kind of a superhero
in his own right. You know, a superhero monk,

466
00:41:54,821 --> 00:42:00,144
as it were. Yeah, yeah. I also think, by the
way, that I agree that he was badass in this

467
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:05,398
movie. There was no question about that whatsoever.
Yeah, and every bit the hero that Ghost Rider

468
00:42:05,438 --> 00:42:10,280
was, you know, he ended up sacrificing himself
at the end just to buy Johnny a chance at saving

469
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:15,302
the kid. So maybe one day he will make an appearance
in the comics. But speaking of the comics,

470
00:42:15,322 --> 00:42:20,565
let's go ahead and move into our villain, Blackout,
aka Ray Carrigan, played by Johnny Whitworth.

471
00:42:20,825 --> 00:42:24,386
This movie, I think, is the first and only time
I've ever seen Johnny Whitworth in anything.

472
00:42:24,886 --> 00:42:31,049
My first impression was that just like Idris
Elba, Carrigan was more character than was

473
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:36,243
necessary for the film. I don't want to be misconstrued
as advocating that actors should be generic

474
00:42:36,323 --> 00:42:42,446
in their roles, but when a movie presents somebody
that is clearly like someone but doesn't really

475
00:42:42,586 --> 00:42:47,288
delve into who that someone is beyond a surface
level, it does leave viewers with a lot of

476
00:42:47,348 --> 00:42:51,930
questions and I think that could be a little
bit frustrating. Beyond the very surface level

477
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:57,153
exploration of Kerrigan, I did think that he
was cool and a convincing enough mercenary

478
00:42:57,353 --> 00:43:02,595
asshole type character. Although I'll say I
didn't find the actor quite as convincing as

479
00:43:02,695 --> 00:43:08,037
Blackout when he's in a super villain form.
I think just because of how like not menacing

480
00:43:08,177 --> 00:43:13,759
and goofy the character looks. Yeah, that hair
was rough. The way his skin was kind of like

481
00:43:13,819 --> 00:43:17,901
peeling around the edges. I mean, I know that
the intent was there because of his ability

482
00:43:17,941 --> 00:43:24,484
to decay, but I don't get decay from Bleach
Blonde. So I was really pulled away from that.

483
00:43:24,984 --> 00:43:29,746
Yeah, what's interesting is that in the comics,
he doesn't have the power of decay. So the

484
00:43:29,786 --> 00:43:36,209
fact that they gave him that power in this movie
and then kind of based his makeup look around

485
00:43:36,409 --> 00:43:42,251
this decaying figure was a strange choice for
sure. What does he do in the comics? So in

486
00:43:42,271 --> 00:43:47,253
the comics, Blackout is a half demon character.
He's the grandson of Lilith, who is the mother

487
00:43:47,273 --> 00:43:53,036
of demons, and he has enhanced strength and
durability and speed like a half demon would.

488
00:43:53,316 --> 00:43:58,090
But he also has razor sharp fangs and claws.
He's kind of like vampiric. in that regard,

489
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:04,452
but his main power is to extinguish light and
generate this type of darkness that deprives

490
00:44:04,512 --> 00:44:09,953
victims of all their senses. So of course that
type of power would be really hard to replicate

491
00:44:09,993 --> 00:44:14,535
on film where audiences need to actually, you
know, see and hear what's going on. But I do

492
00:44:14,575 --> 00:44:19,236
think the movie did an okay job of portraying
it as more of like this psychic darkness of

493
00:44:19,276 --> 00:44:23,677
sorts, where his victims, like minds kind of
go into this shroud of darkness and they only

494
00:44:23,717 --> 00:44:28,565
see him. but you know, it allows the audience
to still see what's going on. I do think that

495
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:35,431
this was an interesting concept for like a henchman
type secondary bad guy. But I'm also with you,

496
00:44:35,471 --> 00:44:40,795
Joseph, like I didn't quite think the performance
was menacing enough at the end. It was it was

497
00:44:40,835 --> 00:44:47,661
more silly than anything I felt. Yeah, for sure.
Speaking of silly, let's go to move on to Mephisto,

498
00:44:48,121 --> 00:44:53,425
a.k.a. Rourke for some reason, played by Kieran
Hines. I'll come out and say it right away.

499
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:59,313
The first movie did it better when it comes
to the devil because Peter Fonda was so cool

500
00:44:59,474 --> 00:45:05,318
in the first Ghost Rider movie and seeing Kieran
Hines take over the role was just so disappointing.

501
00:45:06,098 --> 00:45:11,882
I don't think he brought anything to the role
other than being a man in his later years with

502
00:45:11,922 --> 00:45:16,185
a deepish voice. You know, almost anyone could
have done this role, I feel, but it should

503
00:45:16,205 --> 00:45:20,348
have been Peter Fonda and that way you could
have had that greater sense of continuity between

504
00:45:20,388 --> 00:45:25,767
films. Yeah, I agree. I don't know this actor.
I just kind of thought he was like Stephen

505
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:33,371
Fry's stunt double. Well, you know this guy,
he played Steppenwolf in Justice League. Well,

506
00:45:33,391 --> 00:45:39,615
he did the voice for Steppenwolf. Oh, and the
mocap, I believe. I doubt that. But Rourke

507
00:45:39,735 --> 00:45:43,477
towards the end, when his face is melting, it
just looked really bad. And they should have

508
00:45:43,757 --> 00:45:47,679
went a different route, I think, with that effect.
They probably could have showed his like skin

509
00:45:47,719 --> 00:45:51,561
cracking or something like that. But instead,
they decided to make him look like he had the

510
00:45:51,621 --> 00:45:56,628
mumps. which was a bad call for sure. Yeah.
How do you guys think you would have gone about

511
00:45:56,768 --> 00:46:02,071
portraying visually the idea that his body is
succumbing to its own power? I don't know.

512
00:46:02,151 --> 00:46:06,854
I think you could have gone a route similar
to Ghost Rider and that like he sort of has

513
00:46:06,894 --> 00:46:12,237
this fire emanating from him, at least turn
his skin red. So he looks a tad bit like Mephisto

514
00:46:12,257 --> 00:46:17,160
from the comics, you know. I didn't mind that
Kieran Hines played this role, though, because

515
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:21,810
they did kind of establish the fact that Mephisto
the devil. has taken on many forms through

516
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:26,913
the ages. To me, this was just sort of like
his next form after Peter Fonda. I do agree

517
00:46:26,933 --> 00:46:32,396
that Peter Fonda did it better, but I didn't
really mind the actor swap. Thinking about

518
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:38,259
it for me, I think I would have much rather
seen him not cracking, but like almost losing

519
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:43,562
like structure. Like his bones started showing,
his skin started getting tight around his bones

520
00:46:43,722 --> 00:46:47,585
on certain spots of him. I think that would
have been a better representation, like almost

521
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:51,716
like rapid aging in certain areas. That would
have been a cool effect too, for sure. Both

522
00:46:51,756 --> 00:46:56,380
of those ideas are better than what they did.
Let's go ahead and move on to Nadia Kecs, who

523
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,024
was played by Violante Placido, I think is how
you pronounce that. She's an Italian actress,

524
00:47:01,104 --> 00:47:05,629
I've never seen her before. And she hasn't been
in too much. The only other notable thing I

525
00:47:05,649 --> 00:47:09,772
saw that she was in was Transporter, the series.
But I thought she was good for what the script

526
00:47:09,792 --> 00:47:14,717
called for. I do think she was a believable
badass. I do find myself kind of wishing that

527
00:47:14,737 --> 00:47:18,968
there was... more romantic tension, I guess,
between her and Johnny Blaze, because I think

528
00:47:19,008 --> 00:47:24,332
that could have brought more of an overt father-son-like
dynamic to the story. Wait, because I just

529
00:47:24,392 --> 00:47:29,215
caught on to something that I didn't catch when
I was watching the movie. Her last name is

530
00:47:29,295 --> 00:47:35,939
Ketch? So this is Danny Ketch? This is his mom?
Yeah. Yeah, this is in fact Danny Ketch. The

531
00:47:35,959 --> 00:47:39,922
boy is Danny Ketch from the comics. I guess
we could just jump right into him. He's played

532
00:47:39,942 --> 00:47:46,062
by Fergus Riordan, who, you know, he's a kid
actor. He's fine. He did fine. It is weird

533
00:47:46,082 --> 00:47:49,325
how they made him Danny Ketch though, because
fans of the character will know that Danny

534
00:47:49,345 --> 00:47:53,649
Ketch is Johnny Blaze's brother, who in the
comics, as I mentioned, became the second version

535
00:47:53,669 --> 00:47:58,973
of Ghost Rider. Here, there's no relation between
Danny and Johnny, but I do think that maybe

536
00:47:58,993 --> 00:48:04,938
they were going for like a brotherly type dynamic
between the two characters when Johnny is trying

537
00:48:04,999 --> 00:48:09,602
to kind of relate to the kid and tell him that
the power they have comes from a dark place,

538
00:48:09,663 --> 00:48:14,654
but it doesn't make them bad. It was almost
like he was a mentor. Which is kind of cool.

539
00:48:14,714 --> 00:48:20,378
Like you never see Ghost Rider really as a mentor.
But as cool as it is, I do kind of wish now

540
00:48:20,458 --> 00:48:26,783
knowing that this is fucking Danny Ketch that
they would have cast the role older. Yes. Yeah,

541
00:48:26,803 --> 00:48:30,926
it would have been great if he was in his teens
or something. Yeah. If he was just like five

542
00:48:30,946 --> 00:48:35,629
years older, you could have had like a cool
like Terminator 2 dynamic kind of mentorship

543
00:48:35,649 --> 00:48:40,452
going on. I think that would have been cooler
than what we got here. I think that that's

544
00:48:40,472 --> 00:48:46,687
a good call. Have him older. more capable even
because as a, what do they say, as like nine,

545
00:48:46,787 --> 00:48:52,630
10, 11 years old, something like that. Yeah.
To give that kind of an aged child, that kind

546
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:59,913
of power seems extraordinarily irresponsible.
Yeah, like if Rorke's plan was successful,

547
00:49:00,173 --> 00:49:04,355
then he would have been like this little twerp
kid now with the power of the devil. You would

548
00:49:04,395 --> 00:49:09,917
think that Mephisto would at least wanna transfer
his power into a young adult man at the very

549
00:49:09,957 --> 00:49:14,168
least, you know. Yeah, like early 20s, at least
someone who's gone through fucking puberty.

550
00:49:14,228 --> 00:49:19,037
Come on. Right. That's a great point.

551
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:33,425
Alright, let's go ahead and move into our story
highlights. In Eastern Europe, probably Romania,

552
00:49:33,625 --> 00:49:38,468
I'm guessing, an alcoholic monk named Mereu
tries to warn a monastery that a boy they're

553
00:49:38,488 --> 00:49:44,551
harboring, Dani Kec, is not safe there and he's
wanted by the devil. A group of mercenaries

554
00:49:44,611 --> 00:49:50,574
led by Kerrigan arrive to take the child, causing
Dani and his mother Nadia to flee. I actually

555
00:49:50,594 --> 00:49:54,957
kind of thought this was a really cool setup
for the movie. I was very intrigued by it.

556
00:49:54,977 --> 00:49:59,324
I expected to see Ghost Rider. like right off
the bat, but to see this Muro character, I

557
00:50:01,045 --> 00:50:04,909
thought it was really cool. It was just a pretty
bad scene, I thought. Yeah, the whole like

558
00:50:05,029 --> 00:50:09,833
getting knocked off of his motorcycle and shooting
his gun in slow motion, shooting out the tire

559
00:50:09,913 --> 00:50:13,456
while falling to his death was quite the opening
action scene. Yeah, I thought he was dead.

560
00:50:13,476 --> 00:50:17,620
I thought they were going to kill him off. Yeah,
I was like, well, what was the point of that?

561
00:50:18,401 --> 00:50:23,545
Right. So after a brief animated reintroduction
to Johnny Blaze, Muro seeks him out for help.

562
00:50:23,982 --> 00:50:28,363
promising that if he escorts the boy to his
order, he will help remove the Ghost Rider

563
00:50:28,383 --> 00:50:33,645
curse. Nadia and Danny are captured by Kerrigan
and his men, prompting Ghost Rider to find

564
00:50:33,685 --> 00:50:38,447
them and kill several of the mercenaries, using
the pendant stare on one of them. He's knocked

565
00:50:38,487 --> 00:50:42,969
out with several grenade launchers, however,
and Kerrigan escapes with Danny. I remember

566
00:50:42,989 --> 00:50:47,991
being so pumped for this scene in theaters when
we see Ghost Rider launch his motorcycle over

567
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:54,866
everybody's heads and land and do a donut. I
thought he was immediately going to So when

568
00:50:54,906 --> 00:50:59,448
he just started standing there and rocking I
was like what the fuck is happening kill somebody

569
00:51:01,449 --> 00:51:07,031
I Also thought the pennant stare in this movie
if you didn't know what the pennant stare was

570
00:51:07,392 --> 00:51:12,514
you'd have no fucking idea What was going on
for one it took way too long to implement and

571
00:51:12,554 --> 00:51:16,596
two there were no visual cues exactly as to
what was going Gone, he was just holding their

572
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:22,054
head and they started screaming and then they
had burst into flames, but It seems so unnecessary

573
00:51:22,094 --> 00:51:26,456
because Ghost Rider clearly demonstrated the
ability to make anyone burst into flames upon

574
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:31,918
contact with either him or his chains. So why
would he leave himself vulnerable for so long

575
00:51:31,978 --> 00:51:36,240
taking such a long time to consume this guy's
soul? It just seemed weird. They should have

576
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:40,161
had at least some kind of visual cue with the
eyes like they did in the first movie, where

577
00:51:40,381 --> 00:51:44,043
you could actually see the people living out
their crimes and stuff like that. There was

578
00:51:44,063 --> 00:51:48,185
nothing like that here. Or at least do something
with like the eyes glowing like they did in

579
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:53,683
the opening animation for this movie. Yeah.
I agree. The going back to the first movie

580
00:51:53,703 --> 00:51:59,907
that was much, much better than this movie with
Penn and Stair. And I mean, he even said stuff

581
00:51:59,947 --> 00:52:03,789
in the first one when he was doing the Penn
and Stair. This may just kind of looked creepily

582
00:52:03,809 --> 00:52:09,212
with his head tilting left and right like he
was a dog hearing a funny sound. Right. That's

583
00:52:09,252 --> 00:52:15,295
a great way to describe it. I just want someone
to like make a supercut of like him moving

584
00:52:15,335 --> 00:52:19,397
and like swaying back and forth to like some
music. That would be hilarious. That would

585
00:52:19,437 --> 00:52:23,836
be hilarious. Waking up in the hospital, Johnny
confronts Nadia who took him there and she

586
00:52:23,856 --> 00:52:28,919
wants to know if he can use Ghost Rider to find
Danny. However, the devil aka Rourke places

587
00:52:28,959 --> 00:52:34,543
a spell on Danny through Kerrigan's phone that
prevents Ghost Rider from tracking him. Johnny

588
00:52:34,583 --> 00:52:39,447
learns that Nadia sold her soul to the devil
to keep from dying in exchange, burying the

589
00:52:39,487 --> 00:52:45,611
devil's son Danny. This is where we saw the
second animatic of the movie where we got an

590
00:52:45,651 --> 00:52:51,843
explanation on how the devil uses the power
of his deal. to conduct business on earth or

591
00:52:51,884 --> 00:52:58,149
to get things done. There was a really strange
moment during this scene where they seem to

592
00:52:58,189 --> 00:53:05,476
imply that Jerry Springer was the devil. Yes.
Now this movie came out in 2007 and I think

593
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:11,161
Jerry Springer lost relevancy somewhere like
in 2001, the year 2000. Definitely his peak

594
00:53:11,181 --> 00:53:15,284
was in the 90s, you know. So it was such a dated
reference. I don't understand why they went

595
00:53:15,304 --> 00:53:20,389
with Jerry Springer given that joke was probably
made about a decade too late. This movie came

596
00:53:20,449 --> 00:53:25,533
out in 2012, you said 2007. Oh shit, yeah, this
movie came out in 2012. I meant 2012. So even

597
00:53:25,593 --> 00:53:32,219
later, the first movie came out in 2007. So
by 2012, the Jerry Springer joke was way too

598
00:53:32,259 --> 00:53:37,664
late. Nadia takes Johnny to one of Kerrigan's
contacts at a gambling gring where, as Johnny

599
00:53:37,684 --> 00:53:41,579
tries to constrain Ghost Rider, They learn that
Kerrigan is meeting with an arms dealer at

600
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:47,242
a quarry. They go there and Ghost Rider destroys
everyone using a big ass mining machine while

601
00:53:47,262 --> 00:53:52,025
Nadia rescues and escapes with Danny. Ghost
Rider catches up with them and turns on Nadia,

602
00:53:52,405 --> 00:53:57,087
about to use the pendant stare on her, but reverts
to Johnny when Danny commands him to stop.

603
00:53:57,488 --> 00:54:05,452
So this is where we get the infamous Nicholas
Cage beating down the door performance. A lot

604
00:54:05,472 --> 00:54:09,598
of times when I watch this movie, I just love
it. I laugh my ass off. But I remember the

605
00:54:09,678 --> 00:54:14,101
first time I watched it, I was like, what the
fuck is he doing? As over the top as it was,

606
00:54:14,161 --> 00:54:18,605
I loved it. You can tell he at least has fun.
Like he's really trying to go for something.

607
00:54:18,865 --> 00:54:24,048
Pretending that Ghost Rider is attempting to
crawl out from him. Essentially, I will say

608
00:54:24,088 --> 00:54:28,372
that I did really like the effect that when
he was about to turn into Ghost Rider, like

609
00:54:28,412 --> 00:54:32,574
his eye sockets would suck in, like his face
is turning into a skull. Thought that was a

610
00:54:32,615 --> 00:54:37,498
pretty cool, horrific idea. I mean, as fake
as it looked, I guess it was cool. You say

611
00:54:37,518 --> 00:54:42,781
that Nicolas Cage had fun, but part of me feels
like he was taking this super seriously as

612
00:54:42,801 --> 00:54:47,684
an actor. Like this is his art form, you know?
I don't know if he had fun with it. I don't

613
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:52,547
think he did. I think part of me just feels
like sometimes he's oblivious to what the hell

614
00:54:52,587 --> 00:54:57,770
he's doing and thinks he's doing something brilliant.
And maybe he is. I have no idea. I don't think

615
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:03,633
this is one of those times. Well, it's one of
two things, right? Either he's super not self-aware.

616
00:55:04,142 --> 00:55:10,645
Or he's very self-aware and he has this kind
of like weird sense of humor where he doesn't

617
00:55:10,685 --> 00:55:15,168
really care about what people think about him
and just does whatever he wants to on the day

618
00:55:15,188 --> 00:55:21,511
because he thinks it's fun. I think either option
is plausible, but for the sake of the actor

619
00:55:21,531 --> 00:55:26,254
himself and kind of the respect that I have
for the good performances he has given in the

620
00:55:26,294 --> 00:55:31,437
past, I like to think he just has a weird sense
of humor. An auteur, okay. That's fair. That's

621
00:55:31,477 --> 00:55:35,063
absolutely fair. What did you guys think about
the big ass mining machine? I thought that

622
00:55:35,083 --> 00:55:40,805
was really cool. It's rare that you see Ghost
Rider take over other types of vehicles. We

623
00:55:40,846 --> 00:55:44,307
learned, you know, in the comics later on that
he could do it because, you know, Robbie Reyes

624
00:55:44,447 --> 00:55:49,009
vehicle of choice is his car. But the idea of
the character of Ghost Rider being able to

625
00:55:49,049 --> 00:55:54,372
take over any vehicle and turn it into a hell
vehicle is so cool when that vehicle is, you

626
00:55:54,392 --> 00:56:00,143
know, five stories high and weighing thousands
of tons. I mean, we kind of saw in the first

627
00:56:00,183 --> 00:56:04,147
movie that anything that the rider rides is
going to be a hell vehicle with Carter Slade's

628
00:56:04,187 --> 00:56:11,934
horse. Right. But I do got to say the badass
mining machine, I thought that him turning

629
00:56:11,974 --> 00:56:18,600
into basically a quasi chainsaw was pretty cool.
Yeah, that was so badass. That was really cool.

630
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:23,925
Yeah. If you guys could put Ghost Rider on any
vehicle besides a motorcycle or a car, what

631
00:56:23,945 --> 00:56:27,139
do you think would be cool to see? I'm going
to go with the funny one first, and I'll come

632
00:56:27,179 --> 00:56:31,361
back to a serious one. The funny one is going
to be him on a horse and carriage. Yeah, that

633
00:56:31,381 --> 00:56:34,824
would actually look pretty cool, I think. Yeah,
I think the horse and buggy with him on the

634
00:56:34,864 --> 00:56:39,166
buggy would be pretty fantastic. What's the
not funny one? A Tesla. It's got to be a Tesla.

635
00:56:40,607 --> 00:56:46,271
An electric self-driving hell vehicle, for sure.
I want to see him ride a helicopter, just having

636
00:56:46,331 --> 00:56:51,658
like a flaming freaking fan on top. That'd be
cool. That would be cool. You broke me when

637
00:56:51,678 --> 00:56:56,320
you said helicopter and the first thing that
came into my head is hell a copter. Yeah, that's

638
00:56:56,340 --> 00:57:01,302
how it would have to be spelled, right? Yeah,
well then I'll have two hells instead of the

639
00:57:01,403 --> 00:57:05,444
one. I go two ways with this question. Like
part of me would love to see him write something

640
00:57:05,484 --> 00:57:10,207
ridiculous, like a kid's tricycle and turn it
into like a hell tricycle. But the other part

641
00:57:10,247 --> 00:57:14,029
of me goes the completely opposite direction
and like I would like to see him in like the

642
00:57:14,069 --> 00:57:19,823
space shuttle or something like that. just this
massive like rocket. That would be badass.

643
00:57:19,843 --> 00:57:25,366
That would be awesome. He would just like ride
around like slim pickings from Dr. Strangelove.

644
00:57:25,666 --> 00:57:30,828
That'd be great. Yeah. Back to the story, Johnny,
Nadia and Danny meet up with Muro on their

645
00:57:30,848 --> 00:57:36,371
way to his monastery. Meanwhile, Rourke resurrects
Kerrigan as Blackout who steals an ambulance

646
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:43,070
to track down Danny. Johnny and the group arrive
at Muro's order led by Methodius. Who freaking

647
00:57:43,110 --> 00:57:46,492
knew that Christopher Lambert was going to be
in this movie? Because I did not the first

648
00:57:46,512 --> 00:57:51,515
time I watched it. I was like, holy crap, it's
freaking Highlander Raiden guy. I was very

649
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:56,477
surprised when I saw him. But then I was like,
should I have been? Because like I just held

650
00:57:56,497 --> 00:58:02,461
by Nicolas Cage. It seems like the kind of film
that Christopher Lambert would love to be in.

651
00:58:02,481 --> 00:58:06,943
My favorite gag in the whole movie is during
this part where we see Blackout riding in the

652
00:58:07,003 --> 00:58:10,825
ambulance and he's looking for something to
eat. But everything he touches decays in his

653
00:58:10,845 --> 00:58:16,697
grasp. until he grabs the Twinkie, which just
stays static. And he's like, oh, okay, pops

654
00:58:16,737 --> 00:58:20,981
it in his mouth. I thought that was hilarious.
Yeah. That was funny, but it left me with questions.

655
00:58:21,041 --> 00:58:25,864
He was pulling things out of the lunchbox. They
were decaying. How was he driving the ambulance?

656
00:58:26,285 --> 00:58:31,048
That's a great question. You would think that
like how the sword started rusting that he

657
00:58:31,108 --> 00:58:36,492
touched later on, that anything metal that he
was touching like the car would also rust or

658
00:58:36,753 --> 00:58:41,024
fall apart. It's a great question. Back to the
story, Muro tells Johnny about the history

659
00:58:41,044 --> 00:58:46,188
of the demon Zerathos, how it was an angel of
justice before being tortured in hell and corrupted

660
00:58:46,228 --> 00:58:50,752
into the spirit of vengeance and then bonded
to Johnny as the ghostwriter. After confessing

661
00:58:50,792 --> 00:58:55,035
that his deal with the devil was made out of
selfishness, Johnny goes into a chamber and

662
00:58:55,115 --> 00:58:59,539
exorcises the demon. It was an interesting scene
when Ghostwriter was getting exorcised, like

663
00:58:59,559 --> 00:59:03,723
it was a weird acting moment I think when Nicolas
Cage was like, Merry Christmas assholes or

664
00:59:03,743 --> 00:59:11,203
something like that. It's so bizarre. Right?
Such a Nick Cage moment, for sure. Meanwhile,

665
00:59:11,243 --> 00:59:15,985
Methodius attempts to kill Dany, believing that
the boy is a threat as long as he exists. He

666
00:59:16,005 --> 00:59:21,247
and the monks are killed by Blackout, however,
who kidnaps Dany and delivers him to Rourke,

667
00:59:21,528 --> 00:59:26,710
who plans to transfer his mind and power into
the child in a ritual. Johnny, Mereau, and

668
00:59:26,770 --> 00:59:33,293
Nadia infiltrate the ritual location to rescue
Dany. Kerrigan kills Mereau, but Dany returns

669
00:59:33,333 --> 00:59:38,724
the demon, Zerathos, to Johnny. giving him back
the power of the Ghost Rider. Ghost Rider kills

670
00:59:38,764 --> 00:59:43,687
the Devil Worshippers in attendance, then pursues
Rourke, who had escaped the ritual with Dany.

671
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:50,311
Between when Johnny didn't have the demon and
when he did, he was being held down by Garragon,

672
00:59:50,371 --> 00:59:55,735
who was rubbing his hands all over Johnny and
touching him, and you'd see the decay, but

673
00:59:55,755 --> 01:00:02,354
then it would instantly heal. Yeah. Why? That
has no logical sense to it. No, it's definitely

674
01:00:02,454 --> 01:00:07,536
an error in special effects continuity where
we clearly see Johnny Blaze's forehead start

675
01:00:07,556 --> 01:00:12,679
to decay and then in the very next shot, it's
entirely gone. I do think that this is an editing

676
01:00:12,779 --> 01:00:18,441
issue. I think they took too long with Blackout
holding Johnny Blaze and didn't get to the

677
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:22,743
whole getting the power back quick enough. My
favorite shot in the whole movie though is

678
01:00:22,863 --> 01:00:27,905
that above shot down on Ghost Rider as he's
surrounded by the devil worshipers and then

679
01:00:27,945 --> 01:00:33,589
he turns into and he spins his chain around,
just freaking annihilating all of them. I love

680
01:00:33,609 --> 01:00:38,133
that shot. That was a cool shot. Legend of Zelda
style. Mm hmm. I kind of liked it and how like

681
01:00:38,273 --> 01:00:42,977
you weren't quite sure in that moment if he
was going to fully be Ghost Rider until he

682
01:00:43,017 --> 01:00:48,482
whips out that chain. It's like surprise, bitches.
Then they're all dead. Yeah. In a really cool

683
01:00:48,522 --> 01:00:54,086
chase scene, Ghost Rider destroys Rourke's convoy
and fights Blackout, who eventually succumbs

684
01:00:54,126 --> 01:00:58,726
to Ghost Rider's penance there after causing
Rourke's vehicle to crash. Ghost Rider sends

685
01:00:58,746 --> 01:01:03,010
him back to hell by slamming him through the
ground. Though Danny is believed to be dead,

686
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:07,974
Johnny is able to summon the power of Zerathos'
former angel powers to revive him. The film

687
01:01:08,094 --> 01:01:13,298
ends with Ghost Rider wielding blue fire. Riding
into the sunset. I thought it was a great chase

688
01:01:13,318 --> 01:01:17,222
scene towards the interior. It was cool to see
him take over one of the military vehicles

689
01:01:17,262 --> 01:01:22,006
and turn it into like a hell jeep. Yeah. Again,
I think that the penistare took too long to

690
01:01:22,046 --> 01:01:27,014
work on Blackout. At that point, it almost felt
like a kind of a not a Deus Ex Machina. but

691
01:01:27,034 --> 01:01:32,217
kind of like this cheap move where you always
knew that Ghost Rider had it in his back pocket,

692
01:01:32,357 --> 01:01:37,441
the ability to do the pendant stare. So you
wonder why he didn't like do it sooner or why

693
01:01:37,481 --> 01:01:41,604
doesn't he do it more often, I guess, against
these guys. It's almost like Ghost Rider knew

694
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:47,107
he was saving the pendant stare for the climax
in his fight against Blackout, which is, feels

695
01:01:47,128 --> 01:01:52,551
a little, yeah, cheap. I agree. I thought this
chase scene was really cool at the end. I loved

696
01:01:52,952 --> 01:01:57,134
just being able to see everything because it
took place during the day. As cool as Ghost

697
01:01:57,154 --> 01:02:02,178
Rider looks at night, I thought he looked equally
as cool during the day with like all the black

698
01:02:02,238 --> 01:02:06,782
smoke and stuff like that. That was it was awesome
to see. You showed me the trailer for this

699
01:02:06,822 --> 01:02:14,048
movie before I watched it, Joseph. I was surprised
at how much of like the final chase scene sequence

700
01:02:14,088 --> 01:02:20,233
in battle ended up in the trailer. Yeah, definitely
the final ripping out of the axle and causing

701
01:02:20,453 --> 01:02:24,096
Rourke's vehicle to crash. That was kind of
like his coup de grace, you know, other than

702
01:02:24,156 --> 01:02:27,586
slamming work through the ground. And actually,
you know what? Slamming Gork through the ground

703
01:02:27,626 --> 01:02:32,288
was also in the trailer. So it was, yeah, the
whole final blow was entirely in the marketing

704
01:02:32,328 --> 01:02:35,910
for this film. Although I guess you wouldn't
know that unless you had seen the movie. So

705
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:40,012
was the flame therapy in this, by the way, that
was also one of the trailers. That's right.

706
01:02:40,172 --> 01:02:45,594
That's so awesome. I was going to say stupid,
but then I switched it to awesome because I

707
01:02:45,614 --> 01:02:51,036
think that's a better description. I do kind
of love how the last line, you know, like at

708
01:02:51,076 --> 01:02:55,158
the end of Punisher Warzone, the last line was
like, oh, great. Now I got. brain splattered

709
01:02:55,198 --> 01:03:01,662
all over me, which is just like, it's so ridiculous,
but it's amusing in how devil may care. It

710
01:03:01,742 --> 01:03:06,605
is to use a pun. The last line for this movie
was just as good where they're like, did we

711
01:03:06,665 --> 01:03:11,067
win? And he's like, I'm gonna say yes. Hell
yes. And like the camera zooms in on his face

712
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:17,631
and everything like that. So good. His eyes
like bulged out of his head. Yeah. Jonathan,

713
01:03:17,671 --> 01:03:22,546
I take it you didn't like that. I fucking rolled
my eyes so fucking hard. No one cares about

714
01:03:22,566 --> 01:03:27,068
your opinion. That was awesome. Apparently.
But that's the end of the film. Overall, you

715
01:03:27,088 --> 01:03:32,630
know, the film is such a mixed bag. There are
aspects to Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance

716
01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:36,932
that I have a lot of fun with that I think are
really well done for the character of Ghost

717
01:03:36,972 --> 01:03:43,014
Rider. There are also some pretty objectively
bad parts about the film. Nicolas Cage's performance

718
01:03:43,054 --> 01:03:47,616
being one of them. Even though I do think he
had fun, I do think he could have made some

719
01:03:47,656 --> 01:03:54,397
better choices for a better film. So. The film
revs and stalls, swerving between gritty and

720
01:03:54,457 --> 01:04:00,122
silly, with scorching action, but a cliched
story, with fiery performances, but burned

721
01:04:00,182 --> 01:04:06,628
out dialogue. I'm giving the film 3 stars out
of 5, which is a 60%, but I'm classifying it

722
01:04:06,688 --> 01:04:11,633
as a rotten rating for Rotten Tomatoes. Because
at the end of the day, I don't think I would

723
01:04:11,673 --> 01:04:16,217
actually recommend it to a whole lot of people
unless they were big time Ghost Rider fans.

724
01:04:16,746 --> 01:04:22,610
Yeah, I think a rotten rating makes sense because
it's right on the cusp of 60%. So you could

725
01:04:22,931 --> 01:04:27,735
go either way. And I do agree that there was
a lot to like about it. There was also a lot

726
01:04:27,775 --> 01:04:32,699
to dislike about it. The biggest thing I disliked,
as I mentioned earlier, was Nicolas Cage's

727
01:04:32,739 --> 01:04:38,664
performance. I think he kind of hurt the film
in a way, which is hard to say because I know

728
01:04:38,764 --> 01:04:44,609
how cherished Nicolas Cage is as an actor. But
sometimes it just came off as almost borderline

729
01:04:44,649 --> 01:04:49,643
cartoony. and just bizarre as I mentioned earlier.
Ultimately, my thoughts on the film come down

730
01:04:49,683 --> 01:04:55,566
to how much I respect David Goyer as a writer
versus Nicolas Cage as an actor. And I really

731
01:04:55,586 --> 01:05:01,168
find it hard to believe that David Goyer, as
often as he can sometimes drop the ball, would

732
01:05:01,228 --> 01:05:08,151
write lines like, hell yes. You know? So I put
a lot of that on Nicolas Cage. Earlier on,

733
01:05:08,191 --> 01:05:12,833
I did say that I loved this movie and then going
back to it, I hadn't watched it in a long time

734
01:05:12,873 --> 01:05:18,640
and a lot of it doesn't feel like it. did when
I watched it 11 years ago. And I mean, that's

735
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:22,883
easy to say. Anybody can forget how something
feels after 11 years. You can totally lose

736
01:05:22,923 --> 01:05:27,726
track of things and how they felt or how they
were. And just in your memory, you know, things

737
01:05:27,786 --> 01:05:33,170
change over time. Seeing Nicolas Cage deliver
lines that felt like he didn't write them.

738
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:37,353
And then in the next scene, there was a bunch
of lines that felt like he wrote them and then

739
01:05:37,493 --> 01:05:43,197
back and then forth. That took me out of it
a lot. The animation sequences also kind of

740
01:05:43,217 --> 01:05:49,128
took me out of it. I had never realized until
you mentioned it actually that this was a requel.

741
01:05:49,589 --> 01:05:54,051
I understand, but I also see no purpose to it.
It could have been a much better movie if they

742
01:05:54,071 --> 01:05:59,574
just continued the continuity and had more of
the same actors or more of that original story

743
01:05:59,614 --> 01:06:04,857
being followed through with. I can't justifiably
even give this better than a 2.5 because of

744
01:06:04,897 --> 01:06:09,560
how much it was let down compared to what I
remembered. So I'm going to go 2.5. Yeah, sometimes

745
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:13,514
nostalgia could get the better of you. I can
totally see. how the film could be two and

746
01:06:13,534 --> 01:06:18,538
a half stars as well as three. But John, thank
