the show.

14
00:01:25,878 --> 00:01:30,539
Hi, welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

15
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:36,202
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

16
00:01:36,822 --> 00:01:42,304
I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm his twin brother
Johnny DC. And this is a big episode. In tie-in

17
00:01:42,344 --> 00:01:48,027
to our previous review of Venom the Last Dance,
we are going to be finding out who would win

18
00:01:48,087 --> 00:01:55,354
in a fight between White Lantern, Kyle Rayner,
and Null, the eldritch god of darkness. This

19
00:01:55,394 --> 00:01:59,495
is going to be a really fun episode because
basically, Null's going to wipe the floor with

20
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:05,096
White Lantern and it's going to be enjoyable
for me to witness that. So both of these characters

21
00:02:05,116 --> 00:02:09,978
are insanely powerful, but if you think Null
is more powerful than the White Lantern Kylo

22
00:02:09,998 --> 00:02:16,380
Renner, I don't know what to say. Cocaine's
a hell of a drug. Well, we'll find out later

23
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:20,101
on this episode, guys. Really excited for it.
Before we get into the duel though, we're going

24
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:24,594
to break down the latest comic book movie news
to come out this past week. including just

25
00:02:24,694 --> 00:02:29,077
one news item actually. It was the new release
dates that were announced in the Marvel Studios

26
00:02:29,137 --> 00:02:34,340
2025 look ahead sizzle reel. Yeah, there was
some DC casting news announcements but it was

27
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,422
really for unrecognizable actors in lesser roles.
So it was hard to get excited about. I find

28
00:02:39,462 --> 00:02:42,844
it hard to get excited about most DC things.
So I totally see where you're coming from.

29
00:02:43,285 --> 00:02:49,848
You are sassy this episode. I think it almost
come from some like insecurity they're having

30
00:02:49,888 --> 00:02:54,887
about the matchup later on. It's gotta be. Nah,
I just had a lot of sugar this morning, so.

31
00:02:55,327 --> 00:03:00,309
Halloween candy. Yeah, exactly. As always guys,

to the no prize. A no prize is an award Marvel

53
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:01,924
used to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic
duel No Prize, is a digital award we post on

54
00:05:02,024 --> 00:05:07,167
Instagram for the person that we feel gave the
best answer to our question of the week. Last

55
00:05:07,227 --> 00:05:13,009
week we asked you guys to give us your best
30 second film pitch for the MCU Blade movie

56
00:05:13,049 --> 00:05:18,391
because we got news that the film was removed
from Marvel's schedule and we had to figure,

57
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:23,693
you know, it's gotta be easier than what they're
making it to crack a Blade script for the movie.

58
00:05:24,182 --> 00:05:27,765
We got quite a number of answers, but we're
going to break down this week's honorable mentions

59
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:34,450
before revealing the no prize winner. Our first
honorable mention goes to Colby Hentges, who

60
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:39,334
said, Hey boys, Colby Hentges. Since Marvel
likes to get cheeky with the punctuation lately,

61
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:46,060
the new Blade movie will be Blade, Ebony. It'll
be Blade teaching the new Black Knight, Dane

62
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,504
Whitman, how to use the Ebony Blade he found
at the end of the Eternals. The Black Knight

63
00:05:51,524 --> 00:05:56,103
will be the young loose cannon. Blades getting
too old for this shit, Whitman. It'll be a

64
00:05:56,724 --> 00:06:01,047
lethal weapon with vampires. But who do we get
to play the Joe Pesci part? Yeah, this is a

65
00:06:01,107 --> 00:06:05,690
pretty good idea. The only appearance we've
gotten of Mahershala Ali as the Blade character,

66
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:10,853
if you can call it an appearance because it
was just his voice, was in the end credit scene

67
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:15,777
of the Eternals movie in which we hear Blade
addressing Dane Whitman, the Black Knight,

68
00:06:15,937 --> 00:06:21,941
about his ebony blade. So we know that those
two have met in the Marvel Cinematic Universe

69
00:06:23,198 --> 00:06:27,759
I like to think that's not a plot thread that
Marvel would just leave hanging. Now the Black

70
00:06:27,799 --> 00:06:32,581
Knight wields a blade in the comic books called
the Ebony Blade, which is a vampiric blade

71
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:36,563
of sorts. You could describe it that way, and
I'm pretty sure that's why Blade showed up

72
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:41,805
in The Eternals even, but Dane Whitman's sword
is a magical, powerful sword that grants him

73
00:06:41,845 --> 00:06:46,687
bloodlust that he constantly has to fight against.
Yeah, I really like the idea of a lethal weapon

74
00:06:46,747 --> 00:06:51,969
vampire movie. I think that's fantastic. As
for who would be cast in the Joe Pesci role?

75
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:59,235
I nominate Joe Pesci. Yeah, just cast Joe Pesci.
He's still around. Great answer, Colby. Our

76
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:05,921
next honorable mention goes to Mason Thompson,
who said, OK, you could involve. Sorry if I'm

77
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:09,264
saying this super fast. You can involve the
werewolf by night in the swamp thing to kind

78
00:07:09,324 --> 00:07:13,628
of continue on from the short film. And Blade
has to hunt them down to see things. They're

79
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:17,691
involved with the vampires. You have the vampires
be like a tribe. So that way, they're they

80
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:22,923
haven't been in MCU because they're like hidden.
And so he hunts them down. He realizes they're

81
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:28,486
not a part of that. And then they came up or
something like that. Like he thinks they're

82
00:07:28,506 --> 00:07:35,350
part of the vampire tribe. And then, yeah. So
Mason Thompson made sure to call back and let

83
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:41,513
us know that he meant Man-Thing and not Swamp-Thing,
since Swamp-Thing is a DC character. But yeah,

84
00:07:41,593 --> 00:07:47,597
both Werewolf by Night and Man-Thing were in
the Werewolf by Night Disney Plus special presentation

85
00:07:47,637 --> 00:07:52,569
that came out a few Halloweens ago. So the characters
are established and yeah, it would be neat

86
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:58,014
for Blade to interact within the supernatural
world that special set up and go after them

87
00:07:58,054 --> 00:08:01,798
thinking that they're, you know, evil creatures,
but it turns out it was just a mix up and then

88
00:08:01,818 --> 00:08:07,703
they all joined together to fight an evil vampire
tribe. I like it. It has shades of like underworld

89
00:08:07,783 --> 00:08:13,229
to it, but underworld is just a cool concept.
Like vampires versus werewolves. Is it currently

90
00:08:13,249 --> 00:08:16,938
being done right now? And so it's ripe for the
picking. Yeah, I didn't think of it that way,

91
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:21,119
but that would be cool. Essentially, it seems
like Mason Thompson is pitching a Midnight

92
00:08:21,179 --> 00:08:25,861
Suns movie that just stars the character of
Blade, which I have no problem with. So we're

93
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:30,422
going to answer Mason. Our next honorable mention
goes to Travis Bailey, who said,

94
00:08:34,123 --> 00:08:37,244
Hey, Travis Bailey, shout out to my good friend.
All right. So look, Contessa goes to Old Man

95
00:08:37,264 --> 00:08:42,265
Hawkeye. I need that rolling out. Right. I'm
putting together a team. We got a threat Lilith

96
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:46,727
out of Idaho. she's producing demons somehow,
we gonna go there we gonna shut her down. They

97
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:51,308
get there, they meet up with Elsa Bloodstone
thinking that she's Lilith, she ain't that

98
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:57,409
but she whoops the ass, alright? But, ass comes
off, I'm not roaming I'm playing, and the big

99
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:02,611
bad at the end, the scarlet witch. Okay he went
through that really quick, but basically Travis's

100
00:09:02,651 --> 00:09:09,313
pitch is having the Contessa hire Hawkeye as
Ronin to go after Lilith during which they

101
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:17,541
encounter Elsa They find out it's not. She teams
up with Ronin, who turns out to be Blade, against

102
00:09:17,701 --> 00:09:21,483
the final bad guy who turns out to be Scarlet
Witch. So there's a lot of elements going on

103
00:09:21,503 --> 00:09:25,225
there. I would probably nix the Scarlet Witch
thing at the end and just have the actual bad

104
00:09:25,245 --> 00:09:29,467
guy be Lilith, the mother of demons, or actually
there's another Lilith who's like the daughter

105
00:09:29,507 --> 00:09:34,010
of Dracula. So you might want to go that route.
But we've been introduced to Elsa Bloodstone

106
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:39,613
in the MCU in the Werewolf by Night special
presentation. And she was fantastic in that

107
00:09:39,633 --> 00:09:44,393
short film. and she managed to get a hold of
the Bloodstone within that story, which we

108
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:51,060
know is a war against vampires. Elsa Bloodstone
would be a great partner for Mahershala Ali's

109
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:56,205
Blade. Yeah, but how do you feel about him as
Ronin? There have been a lot of different characters

110
00:09:56,305 --> 00:10:03,572
to portray the Ronin identity over the years.
Basically, Ronin is kind of a persona for superheroes

111
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:08,404
who have to go undercover. You know, Echo's
been Ronin, Hot Guy's been Ronin. I could totally

112
00:10:08,444 --> 00:10:13,849
see Blade as Ronin. Though I would probably
want that reveal to happen sooner rather than

113
00:10:13,889 --> 00:10:18,953
later. That way you don't have a Blade movie
where Blade rarely shows up. You know, we don't

114
00:10:18,973 --> 00:10:23,016
want to think it's Hot Guy the whole time. Honestly,
if we're nixing the Scarlet Witch thing, yeah,

115
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:29,642
also just nix the Ronin thing. Just have Blade
be recruited to go fight Lilith. I like it.

116
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:34,522
Sold. Yeah, decent concept overall. So thanks
Travis Bailey for your answer. We want to give

117
00:10:34,542 --> 00:10:39,204
a quick shout out to Daniel Alonso, as well
as Travis Herndon, who pitched the idea of

118
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:45,226
a Blade and Ghost Rider team up against Blackout
and Mephisto in Vegas idea, which I thought

119
00:10:45,246 --> 00:10:50,668
was pretty good, but it was more of a demon
movie than a vampire movie. So it didn't get

120
00:10:50,728 --> 00:10:55,730
an honorable mention, but I still liked it.
But the winner of this week's snow prize is

121
00:10:56,271 --> 00:11:03,453
Mike Williams. Who said? Mike Williams here.
Blade movie scripts, maybe Blade versus Morbius.

122
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:09,053
And somehow Spider-Man comes along and convinces
them they need to be on the same team. Probably

123
00:11:09,093 --> 00:11:14,596
never get made, but we can wish upon it. Enjoy
your show, and as always, make mine Marvel.

124
00:11:15,016 --> 00:11:21,681
Peace. Yeah, if any Blade movie was to get made
in an ideal world where the rise to these characters

125
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:28,285
wasn't all jumbled, we would get a Blade versus
Morbius film, right? That would be awesome.

126
00:11:28,825 --> 00:11:33,707
And... They would fight against each other and
then end up teaming up to go up against a larger

127
00:11:34,047 --> 00:11:38,329
vampire threat such as Dracula, Deacon Frost,
someone like that. I think that would be the

128
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:43,011
best case scenario for a Blade movie. Unfortunately,
out of all the ideas that were listed here,

129
00:11:43,031 --> 00:11:47,313
this is least likely to happen because Sony
owns the rights to Morbius. Yeah, but that

130
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:52,715
said, Sony has also lent Spider-Man to the MCU
before, so why not another character like Morbius?

131
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:57,437
Well, they might offer that deal with Marvel
as a way to extend their Spider-Man contract,

132
00:11:57,497 --> 00:12:02,068
so who knows? Maybe it's not out of the realm
of possibility. I would like to see it happen.

133
00:12:02,409 --> 00:12:07,133
In fact, I think if you got like a Blade movie
with Morbius and Elsa Bloodstone as like his

134
00:12:07,173 --> 00:12:11,816
sidekicks, that would be the ultimate best case
scenario. I think honestly, if Sony wants to

135
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:16,881
get even more in Kevin and Faggy's good graces,
they would offer something like that. For sure.

136
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:20,744
So great answer, Mike Williams. You win this
week's No Prize. If you, the listener, want

137
00:12:20,784 --> 00:12:24,847
a shot at winning your own No Prize, stay tuned
to later on this episode when we'll be asking

138
00:12:24,907 --> 00:12:28,838
another question of the week. And now that that's
done. On to the news!

139
00:12:34,414 --> 00:12:39,355
Alright, this past week we got a look ahead
sizzle reel video from Marvel Studios that

140
00:12:39,815 --> 00:12:45,096
details their upcoming projects on Disney+.
And we got a lot of new release dates that

141
00:12:45,116 --> 00:12:49,898
we previously didn't know before. Basically
a reveal of what's coming out later this year

142
00:12:50,138 --> 00:12:54,919
and in 2025. There's a lot of great stuff, a
lot of new footage that was introduced within

143
00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,561
the sizzle reel, including a look at Daredevil
Born Again, where we got to see the fucking

144
00:13:00,601 --> 00:13:04,690
kick-ass action that's going to be in the show.
It looks... Like it's going to continue carrying

145
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:11,812
the torch that the show had on Netflix in terms
of its just gritty, hardcore, rough and tumble

146
00:13:11,932 --> 00:13:17,234
action fights. We got to see Daredevil fighting
characters like Muse and The Punisher. It all

147
00:13:17,314 --> 00:13:22,375
looks so damn fantastic and I really can't wait
for this show to come out. We previously already

148
00:13:22,415 --> 00:13:26,817
got a release date for Daredevil Born Again,
but it reiterated that the show will be debuting

149
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:33,045
on March 4th, 2025. Yeah, I cannot wait. Everything
that comes out for the show just gets me excited

150
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:38,391
for it. It's going to be awesome. The next show
we got to look at was Your Friendly Neighborhood

151
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:43,016
Spider-Man, which is an animated series that's
coming out on Disney+. It takes place in kind

152
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:48,601
of an alternate timeline wherein we get a look
at Peter Parker's early days as the web-slinging

153
00:13:48,641 --> 00:13:53,922
hero where he doesn't quite have his costume
nailed down yet, but What was interesting was

154
00:13:53,942 --> 00:14:00,004
that it was revealed that Peter Parker's mentor
in this timeline is Norman Osborn, not Tony

155
00:14:00,084 --> 00:14:06,065
Stark. So we're going to see how that influence
affects him as a character. That's weird. I

156
00:14:06,085 --> 00:14:10,847
didn't know it was an alternate timeline. Why
would they do that? I don't know. Initially,

157
00:14:10,887 --> 00:14:15,428
the premise of the show was going to be a look
at Peter Parker's origin because we never really

158
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:20,910
got that in the MCU. He was already established
in the Captain America Civil War movie. as

159
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,452
a full-fledged superhero when he was recruited
by Tony Stark. And I thought we were going

160
00:14:25,472 --> 00:14:30,093
to get to see his early adventures as the hero,
how he decided to become the hero and everything

161
00:14:30,134 --> 00:14:35,936
like that. But just knowing that this isn't
like sacred timeline Peter Parker kind of bums

162
00:14:35,976 --> 00:14:41,178
me out. I don't even want to see it now. I know
this has kind of become my least anticipated

163
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:46,440
show for 2025, but we will be reviewing it.
It actually is going to debut on the Disney

164
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,023
Plus television platform on January 29th. So
pretty soon here, actually. The animation looks

165
00:14:52,043 --> 00:14:55,784
pretty good, I'll give it that. It looks like
straight out of a Steve Ditko comic, but the

166
00:14:55,824 --> 00:15:00,206
3D element is pretty nice, considering it's
computer animated. Not quite stylistic on the

167
00:15:00,226 --> 00:15:05,508
same level as the Spider-Verse, but like really
no animation can even approach that franchise.

168
00:15:06,008 --> 00:15:11,191
I'm pretty sure Peter Parker kills a kid by
slamming a brick into his head. Well, we will

169
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:17,333
find out if that kid deserved it or not. Whoa.
But moving on to Ironheart, we learned that

170
00:15:17,493 --> 00:15:23,776
that- live action series is going to debut on
Disney Plus on June 24th. So during the summertime.

171
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:28,858
But we got a cool look at Riri Williams suit
as she's building it. It looks pretty damn

172
00:15:28,878 --> 00:15:33,440
badass. And we also got to look at the hood
within the sizzle reel, which if you didn't

173
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,582
see the leaked D23 footage, this is probably
your first looks at these characters. I wasn't

174
00:15:38,642 --> 00:15:44,104
excited for this show at all. But I got to say,
the footage from it looks really damn good.

175
00:15:44,585 --> 00:15:49,127
Yeah, it looks pretty compelling, honestly.
I'm not a huge fan of Dominique Thorn's Riri

176
00:15:49,147 --> 00:15:54,291
Williams because she didn't impress me in Black
Panther Wakanda forever, but this show does

177
00:15:54,331 --> 00:15:59,855
look pretty dang good. Next up in the sizzle
reel was What If Season 3, which is coming

178
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:05,258
like really fucking soon. I had no idea earlier,
but this show is actually debuting this year

179
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:12,143
on December 22nd with a new episode coming out
each day after it debuts. So we're probably

180
00:16:12,183 --> 00:16:16,234
going to get this show in its entirety before
the start of the new year. We got some pretty

181
00:16:16,274 --> 00:16:23,417
cool shots, like a Western type tale. There
was a fucking Transformers version of Captain

182
00:16:23,457 --> 00:16:28,039
America, which I am like super excited by. That'll
be really cool. I mean, the What If series

183
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:31,661
is just pretty damn good, especially season
two. I really like season two of What If. I

184
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:35,503
thought it was better than season one. So I'm
really looking forward to season three and

185
00:16:35,543 --> 00:16:39,945
seeing what they do there. Yeah, it looks like
What If is getting its first spin-off series

186
00:16:39,985 --> 00:16:45,443
in Marvel Zombies. Right, yeah, we got our first
look at that show, which is gonna be TVMA on

187
00:16:45,483 --> 00:16:50,384
the Disney Plus platform. We got a brief look
at the Marvel Zombies universe in the first

188
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:55,965
season of What If, but they're gonna continue
that story within this Marvel Zombies animated

189
00:16:56,026 --> 00:17:03,087
series, which is gonna come out in time for
Halloween next year in October 2025. The animation

190
00:17:03,327 --> 00:17:07,289
looks spot on. There's a shot here where we
see a bunch of people falling off a building,

191
00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:13,344
and it reminds me a lot of World War Z and...
I'm super pumped for this show. I gotta tell

192
00:17:13,364 --> 00:17:17,187
you. I think the biggest surprise out of this
sizzle reel that came out was our first look

193
00:17:17,307 --> 00:17:23,913
at Wonder Man, which is a television show starring
Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who is no stranger to

194
00:17:23,993 --> 00:17:28,597
comic book shows and movies. Here he is playing
Simon Williams, who is the character of Wonder

195
00:17:28,617 --> 00:17:33,181
Man, the superhero who's also an actor. And
it looks like the television shows is really

196
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:38,165
leaning into that aspect of the character and
kind of sending up, you know, Hollywood tropes

197
00:17:38,285 --> 00:17:43,905
and things like that. It kind of seems like
he is a guy who has superpowers, who is auditioning

198
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:48,969
for a role called Wonder Man, and through the
course of the show he actually becomes that

199
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:55,975
hero. We see him being mentored by Trevor Slattery,
who is played by Ben Kingsley, who infamously

200
00:17:56,275 --> 00:18:02,040
was the guy behind the Mandarin in Iron Man
3, and was great comedic relief in the Shang-Chi

201
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:06,564
film. I'm not a huge fan of Trevor Slattery.
I'll just never forgive what Iron Man 3 did

202
00:18:06,584 --> 00:18:11,459
with the character of the Mandarin, but... since
Shang-Chi was able to kind of salvage that

203
00:18:11,499 --> 00:18:16,941
character and that concept. It's kind of interesting
to see what's going on with Wonder Man. And

204
00:18:17,281 --> 00:18:22,223
honestly, I'm curious. It has piqued my curiosity,
we'll say. I feel like Trevor Slattery was

205
00:18:22,283 --> 00:18:27,526
redeemed in Shang-Chi, especially because the
real Amandarin ended up being way cooler than

206
00:18:27,586 --> 00:18:33,468
anything Iron Man 3 could have imagined. I don't
love the idea that he's acting as a character

207
00:18:33,528 --> 00:18:38,202
called Wonder Man. The whole thing is just kind
of confusing, but Honestly, Trevor Slattery

208
00:18:38,222 --> 00:18:41,744
was the most interesting thing about this footage
to me. Yeah, that show is not going to come

209
00:18:41,764 --> 00:18:47,366
out, though, until next December. So around
Christmas time, 2025. The next show that we

210
00:18:47,386 --> 00:18:52,689
got a look at in the sizzle reel is Eyes of
Wakanda, which looks like an amazing, amazing

211
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:57,931
animated series where we get a look at the Black
Panthers of the past in Wakanda's history.

212
00:18:58,412 --> 00:19:03,862
The animation style, I think, is what stood
out most to me in that. It's not like the What

213
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:08,784
If series or anything else that Disney has produced
for Marvel Studios. It looks a little bit more

214
00:19:08,924 --> 00:19:14,667
stylized and Pixar-y. I guess the best way to
describe it so far is that it kind of reminds

215
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:19,209
me of The Clone Wars. Yeah, yeah, I thought
the same thing. But like with a whole lot more

216
00:19:19,289 --> 00:19:24,271
money put into its budget. Aizu Wakanda is going
to come out in August of next year. Can't wait

217
00:19:24,311 --> 00:19:28,833
to see more on that show. Yeah, I'm really intrigued
by it. Honestly, I think for a lot of these

218
00:19:28,853 --> 00:19:33,848
shows... I kept repeating myself saying that
I am super pumped to see it, but it's true.

219
00:19:34,028 --> 00:19:39,411
You know, there's a lot of good stuff here coming
out from Marvel at the end of this year and

220
00:19:39,431 --> 00:19:44,854
throughout 2025. So this trailer just got me
super pumped, totally aboard the hype train

221
00:19:44,874 --> 00:19:48,916
for what's coming out on Disney plus. And I
know that like Marvel said that they were going

222
00:19:48,936 --> 00:19:53,658
to start winding down the quantity of their
projects and really focus on the quality, but

223
00:19:53,678 --> 00:19:58,061
it seems like we quite have not reached that
point because there's a shit tongue coming

224
00:19:58,081 --> 00:20:03,047
out in 2025. Man. Speaking of all the shit that's
coming out, that brings us to our question

225
00:20:03,087 --> 00:20:03,590
of the week.

226
00:20:08,042 --> 00:20:12,385
I didn't mean like shit, I was like, stuff.
It was a lot of stuff. Yeah, a lot of shit.

227
00:20:12,405 --> 00:20:18,190
Oh God. Out of Marvel Television's upcoming
projects revealed in the sizzle reel, which

228
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:24,295
one gets you the most excited and why? Yeah,
I'm particularly interested in the projects

229
00:20:24,315 --> 00:20:29,259
that you weren't as excited in until you saw
the sizzle reel and then it got you like super

230
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:33,682
pumped. So record your answer at dynamicduel.com

235
00:20:58,286 --> 00:21:01,690
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and get into

236
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:07,918
our main event where we find out who would win
in a fight between the White Lantern, Kyle

237
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,061
Raynor versus Null.

238
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:30,535
Alright, White Lantern vs. Null. Now these two
characters are heavy hitters, if I do say so

239
00:21:30,575 --> 00:21:34,679
myself. Basically they're on the same level
as like Lactis and Spectre. This is that kind

240
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:40,345
of matchup. These guys are just off the charts.
Yeah, White Lantern, Kyle Raynor, is the culmination

241
00:21:40,385 --> 00:21:46,110
of all the different multicolored energies of
light in the universe, and Null is a primordial

242
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:51,887
deity, really, of darkness. They both have...
really badass weapons. Kyle Rayner wields the

243
00:21:51,907 --> 00:21:57,791
White Lantern Power Ring, Null wields All Black
the Necro Sword, and each of them can use their

244
00:21:57,831 --> 00:22:04,274
weapons to produce constructs out of their respective
element of light or darkness. I'm really excited

245
00:22:04,294 --> 00:22:09,217
to be doing a duel episode with Kyle Rayner.
He was the Green Lantern that was around when

246
00:22:09,357 --> 00:22:14,400
I first started reading comic books, so he's
near and dear to my heart. He's known as being

247
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,643
the most creative of the Green Lanterns. Yeah,
we've done a lot of Green Lantern episodes

248
00:22:18,823 --> 00:22:24,307
so far, like against Nova, against Beta Ray
Bill, against Quasar, but this will be the

249
00:22:24,347 --> 00:22:28,569
toughest battle yet for a Green Lantern. I just
don't see how you stand a chance, that being

250
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:32,632
said, I don't know a lot about White Lantern,
so let's go ahead and break down the characters'

251
00:22:32,712 --> 00:22:38,136
histories and abilities. But first, to explain
the methodology behind our duels, let's go

252
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:44,220
to our sentient duel simulator Alfred Jarvis
9000. AJ9K, tell our listeners how you go about

253
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:49,520
determining a winner in our duel matchups. Yes,
of course, sir. The way I determine a winner

254
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,124
between the contestants is by running 1,000
Monte Carlo simulations using the characters'

255
00:22:54,144 --> 00:22:59,729
statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic
model used to determine outcomes through random

256
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:05,634
sampling. In this case, I randomise the statistics
along a normal distribution as a way to simulate

257
00:23:05,654 --> 00:23:10,238
the many variables that can occur during battle.
The stat parameters are based on the official

258
00:23:10,298 --> 00:23:15,586
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters'
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat

259
00:23:15,626 --> 00:23:21,147
categories are included such as range, damage
potential, versatility and perception in order

260
00:23:21,187 --> 00:23:26,609
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.
The results of the 1000 simulations provide

261
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:30,990
a percentage of wins for each character. The
contestant with the higher percentage is declared

262
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:36,311
the victor as they have a higher probability
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,

263
00:23:36,692 --> 00:23:41,493
neither character should win 100% of the matches.
The comic book stories have shown that there's

264
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:46,428
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman. So
the confidence rate of my method falls in line

265
00:23:46,448 --> 00:23:51,052
with the precedents that have been established
in the source material. My mathematical simulations

266
00:23:51,092 --> 00:23:56,236
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes

267
00:23:56,296 --> 00:24:02,341
tabulated for determination of the winner. Thanks
AJ9K! Before we run the simulations though,

268
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:06,986
we like to break down each character's histories
and abilities, before improvising a scenario

269
00:24:07,086 --> 00:24:12,718
on how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations
would play out beat for beat. And I think it's

270
00:24:12,778 --> 00:24:17,281
my turn to go first with the Marvel characters'
backstory, so let me go ahead and tell you

271
00:24:17,381 --> 00:24:24,006
all about Null. In a cosmic cycle of death and
rebirth, the Marvel universe expands from a

272
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:29,890
cosmic singularity over billions of years until
it collapses in on itself to give birth to

273
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:36,554
a new reality. Null, the primordial god of darkness,
was born of the void in the aftermath of the

274
00:24:36,594 --> 00:24:45,079
Marvel Multiverse's sixth iteration. Null drifted
through eternity, untouched by purpose, until

275
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:50,760
the Celestials intruded, igniting the seventh
iteration of existence with their Light of

276
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:57,102
Creation. This light, destined to shape a new
universe, pierced Null's realm of darkness,

277
00:24:57,202 --> 00:25:02,063
forcing him from solitude. With a hatred of
this invading brightness, Null resisted when

278
00:25:02,103 --> 00:25:06,985
the Celestials offered him a cosmic role to
serve as the counterpart to the Beyonders,

279
00:25:07,245 --> 00:25:13,436
known as the King in Black. he waged war upon
the Celestials with his power over the Primordial

280
00:25:13,496 --> 00:25:19,819
Void, determined to reclaim his kingdom of darkness.
In his defiance against the Celestials, Null

281
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:25,843
crafted the first symbiote weapon, All Black,
the Necro Sword, forged from his living Abyss.

282
00:25:26,383 --> 00:25:31,946
With it, he decapitated the Celestial, causing
the other space gods to retaliate, casting

283
00:25:32,006 --> 00:25:38,474
him and the slain Celestial's severed head into
the void. Isolated but undeterred, Null repurposed

284
00:25:38,494 --> 00:25:44,138
the Celestial's head into a forge, using its
cosmic energies to empower his Necro Sword

285
00:25:44,198 --> 00:25:50,342
further and create his Symbiote Armor. In his
own likeness, Null began manifesting life from

286
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:56,146
the darkness itself, experimenting with symbiotic
creatures and forming a hive mind that connected

287
00:25:56,327 --> 00:26:02,151
each creation to his own dark essence. With
his symbiote army at his command, Null clad

288
00:26:02,171 --> 00:26:07,810
himself in his symbiotic armor and set forth
on a genocidal crusade. destroying planets,

289
00:26:08,011 --> 00:26:13,095
extinguishing stars, and slaughtering any god
or creature that dared to dwell in the light.

290
00:26:13,615 --> 00:26:19,920
For eons, Null's dark empire grew, and his legend
spread through the cosmos as a figure of terror.

291
00:26:20,361 --> 00:26:25,565
His conquest drew the attention of a time-displaced
Silver Surfer, who attempted to free a world

292
00:26:25,685 --> 00:26:30,769
under Null's oppressive rule. The two clashed
in an intense battle, with Null successfully

293
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:37,082
infecting the weakened surfer with a symbiote,
making him his Void Knight. Despite the setback,

294
00:26:37,402 --> 00:26:42,665
the Silver Surfer was freed by Ego the Living
Planet and used the last of his power cosmic

295
00:26:42,745 --> 00:26:48,288
to conjure a star, the blinding force of which
hurled Null across the cosmos, temporarily

296
00:26:48,328 --> 00:26:53,491
halting his rampage. Null recovered quickly,
however, and resumed his campaign against the

297
00:26:53,531 --> 00:26:59,495
light undeterred by the setbacks. As his terror
continued, Null encountered an army of gods

298
00:26:59,555 --> 00:27:05,694
empowered by the light of the Enigma Force and
clad in shining golden armor. Null slaughtered

299
00:27:05,714 --> 00:27:11,036
the entire army, save for one who struck a blow
through Null's head as Null impaled the Light

300
00:27:11,076 --> 00:27:17,960
God through the chest. Wounded, Null was discovered
by Gore, an alien mortal who stole All Black

301
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,402
the Necro Sword, claiming it as his own. While
Null could have pursued the weapon, he instead

302
00:27:23,482 --> 00:27:28,765
allowed Gore to wield the All Black, recognizing
the mortal's vengeful heart as a mirror of

303
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:33,956
his own hatred for the Light. As Null recovered
from his battle with the Light Gods, he observed

304
00:27:33,996 --> 00:27:38,900
Ghor's bloody rampage across the stars and took
satisfaction in the devastation wrought by

305
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:44,145
his former blade, knowing that his influence
had once again seeped into the cosmos, spreading

306
00:27:44,185 --> 00:27:49,770
death in his stead. Null's reign resumed and
endured until an ill-fated invasion of Earth

307
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:55,635
during the Middle Ages. One of his most terrifying
creations, a symbiote dragon named Grendel,

308
00:27:55,895 --> 00:28:00,739
arrived on the planet attempting to subjugate
its people. However, the young thunder god

309
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:06,503
Thor rose to defend Earth, striking down the
Grendel with a lightning-charged blow. Thor's

310
00:28:06,543 --> 00:28:12,127
divine lightning energy shattered Null's connection
to his entire symbiote hive, scattering his

311
00:28:12,147 --> 00:28:17,490
creations across the universe and fracturing
his control over them. Free from Null's influence,

312
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:23,014
the symbiotes began bonding with new hosts,
discovering the beauty and honor in light and

313
00:28:23,074 --> 00:28:23,374
life.

314
00:28:28,302 --> 00:28:33,186
binding him within a prison formed from their
own bodies, an artificial planet they called

315
00:28:33,286 --> 00:28:39,811
Klintar, which translates to cage in their language.
Though locked away, Null's dark will was not

316
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:44,735
yet broken. In the centuries that followed,
he subtly influenced symbiote hosts and sent

317
00:28:44,795 --> 00:28:49,839
visions to the Church of the New Darkness, a
cult composed of the few who still remembered

318
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:55,242
and revered his legend from the Middle Ages.
His presence began to stir when the international

319
00:28:55,362 --> 00:29:00,304
espionage organization, SHIELD, unearthed the
remnants of Grendel in modern times, using

320
00:29:00,365 --> 00:29:05,687
its symbiote essence to create super-soldiers
during the Vietnam War, including one commander,

321
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:11,929
Rex Strickland, who was codenamed Tyrannosaurus
Rex. SHIELD's project reawakened Null's psychic

322
00:29:11,989 --> 00:29:17,031
link to the symbiotes, allowing him to exert
control over some of the soldiers, sparking

323
00:29:17,071 --> 00:29:22,453
conflict with a new generation of heroes, including
Eddie Brock, the host of the Venom symbiote.

324
00:29:22,786 --> 00:29:27,347
whom you can learn more about in our Clayface
vs Venom duel episode. Brock's battle with

325
00:29:27,367 --> 00:29:31,908
the Grendel and subsequent entanglement with
Null's cult followers only strengthened the

326
00:29:31,948 --> 00:29:37,490
symbiote god's hold over his long-lost creations.
Through a twisted ritual involving Carnage,

327
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:43,191
Null's followers resurrected Cletus Kasady,
granting him godlike power with Null's influence.

328
00:29:43,731 --> 00:29:48,473
Together, Carnage and Null sought to collect
parts of the Codex, which was a residuel trace

329
00:29:48,513 --> 00:29:54,115
of the hive mind left by symbiotes in their
former hosts. By gathering the Codex, they

330
00:29:54,135 --> 00:29:59,639
hope to break the bonds of Klintar and release
Null once more. You can learn more about Carnage

331
00:29:59,739 --> 00:30:05,503
in his duel against Lobo. Carnage's bloody rampage
for the Codex brought Null ever closer to freedom,

332
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:11,067
culminating in a showdown with Venom that left
Null completely reawakened. Breaking free of

333
00:30:11,087 --> 00:30:16,751
Klintar, he reassembled its fragmented symbiotes
into a horde of dragons and set off on a new

334
00:30:16,771 --> 00:30:22,182
campaign of terror, determined to claim Earth
and crush the light it represented. After reclaiming

335
00:30:22,323 --> 00:30:27,007
All Black the Necro Sword, he cut a path of
destruction across the cosmos, resuming his

336
00:30:27,047 --> 00:30:32,433
cosmic slaughter, conquering countless planets,
and even corrupting and assimilating his celestial

337
00:30:32,493 --> 00:30:38,279
gods into his army. Arriving in Earth's orbit,
Null set his sights on its mightiest heroes,

338
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:44,205
brutally ripping the sentry in half and incorporating
the dark energy of the hero's void persona

339
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:49,911
into himself. covering Earth in a sphere of
living darkness, Null imprisoned or corrupted

340
00:30:49,951 --> 00:30:55,654
heroes in a massive offensive, seeking out Eddie
Brock's young son, Dylan. Before the child

341
00:30:55,674 --> 00:31:01,496
was born, Dylan was influenced in the womb by
the codex of Anne Wang, his mother, who had

342
00:31:01,596 --> 00:31:07,078
once bonded with the Venom symbiote as She-Venom,
granting the child powers capable of countering

343
00:31:07,158 --> 00:31:12,100
Null and the symbiotes. Though Thor tried to
stop Null by using his divine lightning as

344
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:19,812
he had Null himself proved too powerful and
unleashed his full might by sending his symbiote

345
00:31:19,852 --> 00:31:25,255
controlled celestials into battle, overpowering
the Thunder God. At the height of Null's invasion,

346
00:31:25,415 --> 00:31:30,358
the Silver Surfer came to Earth to help fight
his former foe, yet he was also overpowered.

347
00:31:30,778 --> 00:31:35,561
When Null seemed lost, Eddie Brock and Venom
were chosen as the avatar of the Enigma Force,

348
00:31:35,721 --> 00:31:41,084
temporarily becoming the hero known as Captain
Universe. Empowered by this opposite force,

349
00:31:41,224 --> 00:31:47,016
Venom gained the cosmic power to confront Null
directly. In that confrontation, Brock formed

350
00:31:47,076 --> 00:31:52,541
a battle axe merged from Thor's hammer Mjolnir
and the Silver Surfer's surfboard and launched

351
00:31:52,601 --> 00:31:58,126
an assault that stripped Null of his symbiotic
armor, leaving him vulnerable. With Null weakened,

352
00:31:58,506 --> 00:32:03,491
Venom carried the Dark Lord of the Abyss into
the sun, using the Unipower to destroy him

353
00:32:03,651 --> 00:32:08,956
in an eruption of light. With Null's death,
the symbiote hive mind found liberation and

354
00:32:08,996 --> 00:32:13,899
Venom was renamed the new King in Black. guiding
the symbiotes toward a new legacy of protection

355
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,944
instead of conquest. In his final words, Null
cursed Venom, insisting that his darkness would

356
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:26,209
one day return, and in fact, his consciousness
lived on, hidden as a codex within the symbiote

357
00:32:26,229 --> 00:32:32,513
hive-mite. Powers-wise, Null, as a primordial
entity of darkness, has power beyond most other

358
00:32:32,553 --> 00:32:37,697
Marvel characters. He can generate and manipulate
the eldritch void that he calls the Living

359
00:32:37,817 --> 00:32:43,914
Abyss. With it, he can control a parasitic darkness
that can enslave beings as powerful as Celestials

360
00:32:44,234 --> 00:32:49,438
and the Silver Surfer. From it, he can also
create living creatures of darkness, primarily

361
00:32:49,479 --> 00:32:55,343
dragons and symbiotes, some of which, like Grendel,
are powerful enough to destroy whole cities.

362
00:32:55,904 --> 00:33:00,968
Noel can also use the Living Gebess to create
weapons and armor, such as his nearly indestructible

363
00:33:01,028 --> 00:33:05,993
symbiote armor that he can reshape on his body
to form things like a helmet, or a cape, or

364
00:33:06,013 --> 00:33:10,900
a pair of dragon wings. He used the darkness
to forge All Black the Necro Sword, which was

365
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:16,604
strong enough to kill a host of god-like beings,
including decapitating a Celestial, whose cosmic

366
00:33:16,624 --> 00:33:22,848
power he infused into the sword. All Black can
fire dark energy, create dark tendrils, and

367
00:33:22,948 --> 00:33:28,432
even shape-shift its form. Null is immensely
strong, with beyond class 100 level strength,

368
00:33:28,813 --> 00:33:33,796
he is durable enough to withstand Celestial
attacks, and has a regenerative healing factor

369
00:33:33,836 --> 00:33:39,202
derived from his living abyss. He can fly at
orbital speeds using his wings or a dragon

370
00:33:39,242 --> 00:33:44,904
mount, and he is an expert combatant with billions
of years of fighting experience and an expert

371
00:33:44,944 --> 00:33:50,225
strategist with eons of accumulated knowledge.
And that's null. So what you're telling me

372
00:33:50,325 --> 00:33:56,027
is that his weakness is light. What I'm telling
you is that even though his weakness is light,

373
00:33:56,487 --> 00:34:03,229
he has extinguished stars, he has killed light
gods, and he will straight up murder Kyle Rayner's

374
00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:09,832
ass and put him in a fridge. Just like his girlfriend.
Too soon, too soon! No, Null sounds pretty

375
00:34:09,872 --> 00:34:15,576
cool. I didn't know his Necro Sword was imbued
with cosmic energy. That's wild. Yeah, with

376
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:21,680
the energy of a Celestial. What's the cooler
sword? The Necro Sword or Excelsior? Oh, Hulkling

377
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:28,165
Sword? Yeah. By far, the Necro Sword. By far.
Yeah. Okay. It's not even a question. I saw

378
00:34:28,185 --> 00:34:32,307
what Gorr did with the Necro Sword. I didn't
see what Gorr did with the Necro Sword. I thought

379
00:34:32,368 --> 00:34:37,867
Hela had the Necro Sword essentially in the
MCU. No. Oh, if we're talking about the MCU,

380
00:34:38,327 --> 00:34:43,071
Gore wielded the all-black Necro Sword, but
it was very different from how it is in the

381
00:34:43,111 --> 00:34:48,174
comics. You're right, Hela's abilities in Thor
Ragnarok more closely matched the power of

382
00:34:48,194 --> 00:34:54,399
the Necro Sword. Still not as cool as wielding
a power ring, especially a white one. Ooh,

383
00:34:54,459 --> 00:34:59,683
jewelry. All right. But like the coolest jewelry.
You'll learn. You're going to learn today.

384
00:35:00,883 --> 00:35:06,082
Let me tell you all about the White Lantern
Kyle Raynor. At the beginning of the multiverse,

385
00:35:06,202 --> 00:35:12,684
when light and life first emerged, the life
entity was born and was the source of emotional

386
00:35:12,764 --> 00:35:21,306
entities, Aion, Parallax, Predator, Ophidian,
Butcher, Adara, and Proselyte. After battling

387
00:35:21,346 --> 00:35:26,848
the forces of Death and the Black, the entity
went into hibernation within Earth to regain

388
00:35:26,888 --> 00:35:31,089
its strength, with the earliest sentient race,
that would eventually be known as the Guardians

389
00:35:31,109 --> 00:35:36,831
of the Universe, hiding its existence to protect
it. Hundreds of millions of years later, Kyle

390
00:35:36,891 --> 00:35:43,155
Rayner was raised by a single mother, Mara Rayner,
in Los Angeles, California, as his father,

391
00:35:43,355 --> 00:35:49,918
Gabriel Vasquez, was a CIA agent who was forced
to abandon his family due to his line of work.

392
00:35:50,199 --> 00:35:56,042
Despite the lack of a father figure, Kyle channeled
his energy into art, eventually pursuing a

393
00:35:56,082 --> 00:36:01,985
career as a graphic artist. Though his creative
nature set him apart, he struggled financially.

394
00:36:02,534 --> 00:36:07,216
One random night, however, Kyle's life changed
forever when he was approached by a small blue

395
00:36:07,336 --> 00:36:12,859
alien named Gantlet, who was a guardian of the
universe from the planet Oa and a founder of

396
00:36:12,899 --> 00:36:18,722
the Green Lantern Corps Universal Peacekeeping
Force. Gantlet was the last of the Owens after

397
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:23,445
the Green Lantern Corps' destruction, and was
on a mission to bestow the final remaining

398
00:36:23,485 --> 00:36:30,108
power ring to a new bearer. Without explanation,
Gantlet handed Kyle the ring before vanishing.

399
00:36:32,514 --> 00:36:37,858
Kyle tried on the ring, which instantly transformed
his clothing into the standard Green Lantern

400
00:36:37,938 --> 00:36:44,003
uniform. Realizing he'd been given incredible
powers, yet unsure what to do, Kyle showed

401
00:36:44,043 --> 00:36:48,967
the ring to his photographer girlfriend Alex
DeWitt, who encouraged him to become a superhero

402
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:54,011
and change his uniform into one more creative
to set him apart from prior Green Lanterns.

403
00:36:54,511 --> 00:37:00,296
Before long, Kyle helped Superman defeat Mongol,
both sharing surprise at Kyle's ring's ability

404
00:37:00,356 --> 00:37:05,839
to affect the color yellow. a known flaw in
prior Green Lantern rings. You can learn more

405
00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:11,501
about Superman and Mongol in their respective
duels against Dr. Doom and Nihilus. As Kyle

406
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:16,123
continued to train and learn more about his
new powers, tragedy struck when he returned

407
00:37:16,163 --> 00:37:21,966
home one day to find Alex murdered and her body
gruesomely stuffed into a refrigerator by the

408
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:28,409
villain Major Force. Enraged and grief-stricken,
Kyle confronted Major Force, who had operated

409
00:37:28,489 --> 00:37:34,957
under a shadow a Green Lantern power battery,
capable of recharging a Green Lantern ring.

410
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:40,562
After recovering the battery and recharging
his ring, Kyle chose not to kill Major Force,

411
00:37:40,602 --> 00:37:45,927
despite his rage, as he knew Alex would have
wanted him to make the heroic decision, and

412
00:37:45,987 --> 00:37:51,692
he was inspired to fully embrace his role as
a hero and a Green Lantern. Over time, Kyle

413
00:37:51,732 --> 00:37:55,595
became known throughout the superhero community,
forging friendships with other heroes like

414
00:37:55,635 --> 00:38:00,551
Connor Hawk, Wally West, and Donna Troy. the
latter two of whom you can learn more about

415
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:05,955
in their duels against Speedball and She-Hulk.
After joining the Justice League, Kyle eventually

416
00:38:06,016 --> 00:38:11,200
encountered Hal Jordan, his Green Lantern predecessor
and destroyer of the Green Lantern Corps, who

417
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:16,644
had become a nigh-omnipotent villain known as
Parallax. When Parallax attempted to reshape

418
00:38:16,704 --> 00:38:22,549
time and reality, Kyle was forced to sacrifice
the planet Oa to stop him. Upon Kyle's return

419
00:38:22,589 --> 00:38:27,033
to Earth, he settled in New York City, where
he became friends with the former Green Lantern,

420
00:38:27,153 --> 00:38:32,223
Guy Gardner, and he met Jade, the daughter of
another former Green Lantern, Ellen Scott,

421
00:38:32,523 --> 00:38:37,484
who you can learn more about in our Green Lantern
vs Iceman duel. As Kyle's romantic relationship

422
00:38:37,504 --> 00:38:44,426
with Jade developed, he faced new enemies such
as Fatality, Sonar, Nero, and Oblivion, the

423
00:38:44,486 --> 00:38:49,907
latter of which was a manifestation of his own
inner turmoil and fears. Upon realizing the

424
00:38:49,967 --> 00:38:55,969
nature of Oblivion, Kyle confronted and overcame
this dark aspect of himself, allowing him to

425
00:38:56,029 --> 00:39:02,355
tap into his full power potential and transform
into Ion, a being of near limitless power.

426
00:39:02,916 --> 00:39:08,918
As Ion, Kyle was able to cure the former Green
Lantern Jon Stewart's paralysis, and even restore

427
00:39:08,958 --> 00:39:15,241
the planet Oa and the Guardians of the Universe.
In a selfless act, Kyle sacrificed the last

428
00:39:15,301 --> 00:39:20,763
of his omnipotence to reignite Oa's central
power battery, allowing for the recreation

429
00:39:20,943 --> 00:39:26,698
of the Green Lantern core and earning him the
honorary title of Torchbearer. in recognition

430
00:39:26,818 --> 00:39:31,739
of his dedication to the Green Lantern mission
and legacy. When Kyle was led to believe that

431
00:39:31,779 --> 00:39:38,361
Major Force killed his mother, Mara, Kyle decapitated
the villain before flinging his head into space.

432
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:44,403
Fearing he had become a danger to those he loved,
Kyle left Earth and ventured into the cosmos,

433
00:39:44,763 --> 00:39:50,545
where he discovered Hell Jordan's body and unearthed
the truth behind Hell's actions, that Hell

434
00:39:50,565 --> 00:39:56,668
had been possessed by Parallax. a powerful parasitic
entity representing fear, which had driven

435
00:39:56,708 --> 00:40:02,572
him to madness and destruction. Armed with this
revelation, Kyle returned Hell's body to Earth

436
00:40:02,612 --> 00:40:08,657
and helped exercise Parallax from Hal, successfully
restoring Hal as a Green Lantern. You can learn

437
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:13,740
more about Hal in our Green Lantern vs Nova
episode. It was later revealed that Sinestro

438
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:18,884
was the one responsible for Mara's death in
an effort to break Kyle's will so that he could

439
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:24,988
serve as the new host for Parallax. Though Kyle
became Parallax for a time, he was able to

440
00:40:25,028 --> 00:40:29,572
break free of the Entity's control with the
help from Held Jordan, and he was later inducted

441
00:40:29,652 --> 00:40:34,475
into the Green Lantern Corps' Honor Guard, where
he developed a relationship with Sinestro's

442
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:40,020
daughter and fellow Green Lantern, Sora Nick
Natu. During the events of Blackest Night when

443
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:45,164
the dead across the universe were resurrected
as Black Lanterns, Kyle sacrificed his life

444
00:40:45,204 --> 00:40:51,476
to protect his fellow Green Lanterns. As Black
Rings attempted to turn Kyle into a Black Lantern,

445
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:57,159
members of the Indigo Tribe and Star Sapphires
intervened and managed to bring Kyle back to

446
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:03,883
life. After facing a resurrected Black Lantern
version of his former lover, Alyx, Kyle and

447
00:41:03,903 --> 00:41:09,286
the other Green Lanterns managed to repel the
Black Lantern army and defeat its leader, Necron,

448
00:41:09,546 --> 00:41:14,909
the personification of death, when Sinestro
managed to awaken and bond with the life entity

449
00:41:14,949 --> 00:41:19,939
within the Earth. becoming a white lantern.
You can learn more about Sinestro in our Sinestro

450
00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:25,940
vs Magneto duel episode. When a rogue Owen known
as Corona trapped Parallax within the Green

451
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:30,301
Lantern's central power battery, allowing him
to take control of the Green Lantern core,

452
00:41:30,702 --> 00:41:36,703
Kyle became a blue lantern for a time. In the
altered reality following Flashpoint, Kyle

453
00:41:36,723 --> 00:41:42,525
was chosen to wield power rings from each color
of the emotional spectrum, including red rage,

454
00:41:42,905 --> 00:41:50,038
orange avarice, yellow fear, and Green Willpower,
Blue Hope, Indigo Compassion, and Violet Love,

455
00:41:50,438 --> 00:41:56,423
resulting in his transformation into a White
Lantern. With each ring, Kyle underwent intensive

456
00:41:56,463 --> 00:42:01,647
training, mastering the abilities of each color,
a journey that eventually led him to wield

457
00:42:01,748 --> 00:42:07,332
the White Light of Life, enabling him to tap
into every emotion and power associated with

458
00:42:07,352 --> 00:42:12,437
the spectrum. As a White Lantern, Kyle faced
unprecedented threats, including the rise of

459
00:42:12,457 --> 00:42:18,056
the Third Army. a force created by the Guardians
to replace the Green Lantern Corps. With the

460
00:42:18,076 --> 00:42:23,339
Third Army's ability to infect and transform
others into soulless soldiers for the Guardians,

461
00:42:23,659 --> 00:42:29,123
Kyle worked alongside other Lanterns to destroy
the Third Army and stop the Guardians. During

462
00:42:29,163 --> 00:42:34,486
this period, Kyle became instrumental in the
battle against Relic, a scientist from a previous

463
00:42:34,546 --> 00:42:40,589
universe who sought to drain the emotional spectrum's
energy, believing that its depletion was inevitable.

464
00:42:41,102 --> 00:42:45,683
Kyle and other lanterns attempted to stop Relic,
but his knowledge of the Spectrum's mechanics

465
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:52,285
made him a formidable opponent. Relic's attack
led Kyle to confront the Source Wall, a boundary

466
00:42:52,325 --> 00:42:57,726
at the edge of the universe. In a final bid
to stop Relic, Kyle passed through the Source

467
00:42:57,766 --> 00:43:03,528
Wall, a feat that no one had survived, and one
that restored each of the emotional entities.

468
00:43:04,068 --> 00:43:08,869
Although the universe believed him dead, Kyle
eventually re-emerged from the other side,

469
00:43:09,326 --> 00:43:14,548
forever changed by the experience and equipped
with new cosmic insights. Upon his return,

470
00:43:14,588 --> 00:43:20,532
Kyle's powers as a White Lantern grew, allowing
him to wield life energy at an unparalleled

471
00:43:20,652 --> 00:43:26,215
level. His unique role drew the attention of
the new gods, led by Highfather, who sought

472
00:43:26,255 --> 00:43:31,678
to harness the life equation now within Kyle
to create a weapon that would kill Darkseid.

473
00:43:32,078 --> 00:43:39,782
Highfather manipulated Kyle in an attempt to
forcefully sever his connection to the Kyle

474
00:43:39,822 --> 00:43:45,723
resisted, however, and ultimately joined forces
with other lanterns and allies to prevent Highfather's

475
00:43:45,803 --> 00:43:50,665
plans, as it would have resulted in the deaths
of billions. Realizing that his power could

476
00:43:50,765 --> 00:43:56,006
easily become a target, Kyle made the difficult
decision to distribute the White Light among

477
00:43:56,107 --> 00:44:02,448
a select group, forming a small, white lantern
core dedicated to safeguarding life. Kyle's

478
00:44:02,488 --> 00:44:08,278
duties as a white lantern extended beyond traditional
heroics. He used his power to heal and rebuild

479
00:44:08,358 --> 00:44:14,000
worlds devastated by conflict, guiding civilizations
in need, and providing them with the means

480
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:19,181
to prosper. His new status also introduced him
to beings across the universe who sought the

481
00:44:19,221 --> 00:44:24,063
White Lantern's influence, from the Guardians
to cosmic entities intrigued by his ability

482
00:44:24,103 --> 00:44:29,544
to channel life itself. This journey taught
Kyle a new level of responsibility as he grappled

483
00:44:29,564 --> 00:44:35,022
with the implications of holding the life equation
and the ethical dilemmas it posed. Balancing

484
00:44:35,082 --> 00:44:40,183
the interests of various cosmic powers, Kyle
carefully navigated his position as a force

485
00:44:40,223 --> 00:44:45,584
of creation, ensuring that his actions served
the greater good. After helping the Omega Men

486
00:44:45,664 --> 00:44:50,766
overthrow the tyrannical rulers of the Vegas
system, Kyle was summoned by some of his Owen

487
00:44:50,906 --> 00:44:57,208
allies to help resurrect Hal Jordan, who had
died. Successfully doing so, Kyle then attempted

488
00:44:57,248 --> 00:44:59,568
to resurrect the entirety of the Blue Lantern

489
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:09,846
and Kyle returned to being a Green Lantern once
again. But for this match, Kyle will luckily

490
00:45:09,906 --> 00:45:15,350
be in full-on White Lantern mode, as he's one
of the few beings in existence capable of wielding

491
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:21,995
each color of the emotional power spectrum in
DC Comics. These capabilities include indestructible

492
00:45:22,055 --> 00:45:28,080
construct generation, allowing Kyle to manifest
anything he can imagine in any solid color

493
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:34,903
he chooses except for black. He could also detect
and instill emotions in others as well as fly,

494
00:45:35,383 --> 00:45:41,565
teleport himself and others across the universe,
see others' memories, and heal himself and

495
00:45:41,685 --> 00:45:48,027
others even from fatal wounds. And unlike other
power rings, his ring requires no charge as

496
00:45:48,067 --> 00:45:53,328
long as he's cultivating life with it. And that's
Kylo Renner. Well, trust me, Kylo Renner will

497
00:45:53,368 --> 00:45:58,670
not be cultivating any sort of life while in
battle against Null, the King in Black. All

498
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:02,614
he's going to be doing is fighting, so I feel
like he's just going to run out of energy eventually.

499
00:46:02,914 --> 00:46:06,538
Yeah, no, that's not going to happen. Especially
when Kylo Renner is just going to make short

500
00:46:06,578 --> 00:46:12,745
work of Vel. Oh, you think so, huh? I do, in
fact. Well, let's find out then. All right.

501
00:46:12,785 --> 00:46:13,445
Come at me, bro.

who will emerge victorious. Visit dynamicpodcast.com
where we settle the debate and settle the score.

510
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:11,832
Now that we've got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

511
00:47:11,892 --> 00:47:18,096
of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not this speculation,

512
00:47:18,476 --> 00:47:24,079
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could
play out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?

513
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,962
Well, I should say there are no rules, other
than the characters have no prior knowledge

514
00:47:28,982 --> 00:47:33,384
of the other going into the fight. All they
are aware of starting out is that the other

515
00:47:33,404 --> 00:47:38,482
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.
For the speculation, the contestants will begin

516
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:43,585
approximately 50 meters apart in a non-descript
environment that will have no bearing on the

517
00:47:43,625 --> 00:47:48,967
match itself, as no environmental statistics
are considered in my simulations. The contestants

518
00:47:49,007 --> 00:47:54,249
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright
then let's get into it. White Lantern and Null

519
00:47:54,389 --> 00:47:59,631
meet on the battlefield. Who goes first? I'm
going to say that Kyle starts off, you know,

520
00:47:59,691 --> 00:48:05,793
he's going to see Null's Necro Sword, and in
response he's going to create like a giant...

521
00:48:06,274 --> 00:48:11,198
futuristic lightsaber version of the Buster
Sword, you know, Cloud's weapon from Final

522
00:48:11,218 --> 00:48:18,305
Fantasy. Basically just a big ass lightsaber.
Alright, uh, Null's gonna see this and like,

523
00:48:18,665 --> 00:48:23,089
he's gonna tell White Lantern that he's gonna
slit his throat and choke out the stars with

524
00:48:23,129 --> 00:48:30,436
his blood. And Kyle's gonna be like, okay, not
a Star Wars fan, I guess. More of a Star Trek

525
00:48:30,496 --> 00:48:36,711
guy, apparently. And that's when he's gonna
lift his giant lightsaber sword straight into

526
00:48:36,751 --> 00:48:42,074
the air and just slash downward towards Null.
It's gonna emit this vertical wave of pure

527
00:48:42,134 --> 00:48:47,757
light energy that's gonna slash Null right in
half. No, because White Lantern's massively

528
00:48:47,797 --> 00:48:52,279
telegraphing with his big-ass sword swinging
downward and everything, so Null's gonna be

529
00:48:52,339 --> 00:48:58,758
ready. He's gonna unleash a giant symbiote dragon
that serves as a shield to protect him. The

530
00:48:58,778 --> 00:49:03,641
wave of light is gonna evaporate the dragon
from existence, but as it does that, we see

531
00:49:03,721 --> 00:49:10,485
Null riding another symbiote dragon like a steed,
and he's just gonna charge full on White Lantern,

532
00:49:11,086 --> 00:49:18,491
and charging along with Null and his dragon
are gonna be like a hundred symbiote tendrils,

533
00:49:18,511 --> 00:49:23,854
okay? And each one of those tendrils has a mouth
at the end with sharp teeth. Basically, they

534
00:49:23,895 --> 00:49:29,566
just like pass over White Lantern like a cavalry
running over a foot and they just devour him

535
00:49:29,606 --> 00:49:35,151
to small bits as they pass. So I just imagine
this as him like riding like a black wave of

536
00:49:35,331 --> 00:49:42,317
like ink and teeth. Yeah, pretty much. That's
kind of cool. But I'm going to say when Kyle

537
00:49:42,377 --> 00:49:48,262
sees Noel charging, get him like a Lancer. He's
going to create a massive energy cannon in

538
00:49:48,302 --> 00:49:55,248
the shape of like a lion mech robot that shoots
light energy from its mouth. And he's going

539
00:49:55,268 --> 00:50:01,767
to blast Noel and his dragon. with this white
hot energy beam. And alongside Kyle are gonna

540
00:50:01,787 --> 00:50:06,848
be four other mech lions, which are focused
on shooting down all of the individuel symbiote

541
00:50:06,908 --> 00:50:14,290
tendrils. So, all right, the lion cannon destroys
the symbiote dragon, but Null's gonna leap

542
00:50:14,430 --> 00:50:19,652
off of it in time to avoid the blast himself.
And from the symbiote armor, he's gonna sprout

543
00:50:19,732 --> 00:50:26,018
giant dragon wings of his own, and he's gonna
just continue on swooping in. and ramming his

544
00:50:26,058 --> 00:50:31,640
necro sword through White Lantern, impaling
him like Vlad the Impaler. Uh, alright, so,

545
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:38,423
Kyle, I guess he gets impaled through his chest,
but that's when a spinning energy saw blade

546
00:50:38,543 --> 00:50:44,385
just comes down and slices the necro sword blade
off, like, at the hilt. And while it spins

547
00:50:44,425 --> 00:50:50,168
through the air around Null, just carving chunks
of his armor off, Kyle's gonna pull the necro

548
00:50:50,188 --> 00:50:55,630
blade out of his chest, and just overload it
with white light until it vanishes. and then

549
00:50:55,690 --> 00:51:01,711
he's gonna heal his chest wound while Null is
still distracted by the saw blade. Okay, it

550
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:08,473
would take an insanely powerful attack to break
the Necro Sword, okay? Because it's not only

551
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:15,335
supremely powerful, it's also imbued with the
power of a Celestial. Yeah, and? I guess I'll

552
00:51:15,355 --> 00:51:21,057
allow it since White Lantern seems pretty powerful
with his light-based attacks, but like, that

553
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:26,631
wouldn't even matter because Null has... created
a new all-black necro sword before. And maybe

554
00:51:26,671 --> 00:51:31,773
this one's not quite as powerful, but it's not
like the sword is the source of his living

555
00:51:31,813 --> 00:51:37,735
abyss powers. So while White Lantern is healing,
Null is just gonna conjure a new sword from

556
00:51:37,775 --> 00:51:44,978
the hilt of his old one, and then create like
a giant clawed symbiote hand that like swats

557
00:51:45,078 --> 00:51:50,200
the energy saw blade away and snatches up White
Lantern in its grasp, just crushing him to

558
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:57,185
death in like this Iron Maiden pointy. grip?
Well, not really, because as the Iron Maiden

559
00:51:57,225 --> 00:52:04,331
grip tightens, you know, Kyle's light aura is
going to solidify and expand into this protective

560
00:52:04,391 --> 00:52:10,596
sphere. And as Kyle's pushing back against the
darkness, that's when he's going to yell, let's

561
00:52:10,636 --> 00:52:15,921
go Voltron force. And that's when his five lion
mecha's that he created transform around him

562
00:52:15,941 --> 00:52:24,346
into a giant mecha robot. I figured that was
His giant mecha is gonna slam his palm down

563
00:52:24,486 --> 00:52:30,308
onto Null and just splatter him everywhere.
No, cause when the giant Voltron robot slams

564
00:52:30,368 --> 00:52:36,850
his hand down, it's gonna slam onto a giant
spike. Like this spire that Null has erupted

565
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:43,872
from the ground beside him. And from the spire
is gonna leak this black symbiotic ooze that

566
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:49,533
rushes all over the Voltron bot, just taking
it over and transforming Voltron into like

567
00:52:49,573 --> 00:52:55,786
this giant- Horned demon monster type thing
and the living abyss is also gonna seep into

568
00:52:55,826 --> 00:53:01,250
white lanterns control room area Inside the
robot and take him over to just enslaving white

569
00:53:01,291 --> 00:53:07,436
lantern to the will of null and making him his
new Void knight just like null did with the

570
00:53:07,476 --> 00:53:13,961
silver surfer. So this match is over No, no,
cuz let's say as the giant mecha is being taken

571
00:53:14,061 --> 00:53:21,427
over That's when the mecha is white light turns
bright indigo and its energy instills within

572
00:53:21,487 --> 00:53:27,352
Null this very strong sense of compassion, causing
him to, you know, summon the darkness back

573
00:53:27,392 --> 00:53:34,859
to him. So while Null is having this very sensitive
moment, that's when Kyle expands a white dwarf

574
00:53:34,899 --> 00:53:42,226
star within Null's head, obliterating him and
his symbiote armor into nothingness. Wow. Okay.

575
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:50,728
Well, anyone who's ever tried to... Psychically
or empathically affect null they're just exposed

576
00:53:50,768 --> 00:53:55,191
to the void that is his essence essentially
it doesn't go well for them They basically

577
00:53:55,231 --> 00:54:01,196
become catatonic So I'm gonna say that's what
happens to white lantern when he tries to manipulate

578
00:54:01,296 --> 00:54:06,659
nulls emotions But it's not like Kyle's mind
is connected to his you know empathic powers

579
00:54:06,699 --> 00:54:13,024
his emotional influence powers Okay, like even
if white lantern was successful in killing

580
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:18,359
null with a white dwarf star inside his head
Kyle was assimilated, even if briefly, which

581
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:25,485
means that he's now part of the Symbiote Hivemind
as a codex that Null's consciousness can still

582
00:54:25,505 --> 00:54:31,750
have influence over even after his quote unquote
death. So like White Lantern thinks he's won,

583
00:54:32,151 --> 00:54:38,896
but suddenly Kyle's white ring turns black with
like a red spiral on it and he becomes a black

584
00:54:38,936 --> 00:54:48,283
lantern under Null's control. So Null still
wins no matter what. Null's dead, Kyle is alive,

585
00:54:48,583 --> 00:54:54,845
and you think Null wins? Yes, because at the
end, Null's consciousness is in his ring controlling

586
00:54:54,885 --> 00:55:01,208
him. Pretty sure that's not how this works.
Null's dead, Kyle's alive, match over. I think

587
00:55:01,228 --> 00:55:06,270
what you mean to say is that no matter what
happens, Null wins either way. Either White

588
00:55:06,290 --> 00:55:12,072
Lantern becomes assimilated, or he dies, or
he comes under Null's control, so yeah. So

589
00:55:12,112 --> 00:55:16,515
many ways for Null to win this, you're screwed.
Well let's take it to the stats then. Sure!

590
00:55:16,795 --> 00:55:23,080
Alright, yeah let's input them, run the simulations,
and get the results. AG9K, hit it! Inputting

591
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:29,705
data. Running calculations. Processing results.
Simulations complete. This was a damn good

592
00:55:29,725 --> 00:55:34,489
match you guys. Man their stats were just so
freaking powerful. I don't see how any other

593
00:55:34,509 --> 00:55:39,253
character would be able to go up against these
guys. Both White Lantern and Null statistically

594
00:55:39,293 --> 00:55:46,278
were maxed out. in their durability, their strength,
their damage level, their range. We did say

595
00:55:46,298 --> 00:55:50,902
that White Lantern was a little bit faster because
he can essentially teleport across the entire

596
00:55:50,982 --> 00:55:56,086
universe, whereas Null has to, you know, like
travel through the universe. Yeah, we also

597
00:55:56,106 --> 00:56:01,670
said that White Lantern was slightly more versatile
than Null because the guy's, you know, a freaking

598
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:07,618
White Lantern. Yeah, he does have control over
the entire spectrum, you know. whereas Null

599
00:56:07,698 --> 00:56:12,621
sticks to his living abyss and darkness motif,
so he doesn't have quite as many tricks up

600
00:56:12,641 --> 00:56:18,705
his sleeve. But we did say that Null was more
intelligent than Kyle and a better fighter.

601
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:24,568
But Kyle rated higher when it came to evasiveness
because he's more prone to creating force fields.

602
00:56:25,108 --> 00:56:30,412
The interesting stat here I thought was perception,
because White Lantern has the ability to detect

603
00:56:30,572 --> 00:56:34,766
emotions across the universe and hone in on
them and stuff like that. But Null is also

604
00:56:34,806 --> 00:56:39,708
connected to his symbiotes around the universe.
So he can kind of like manifest an avatar of

605
00:56:39,728 --> 00:56:44,990
himself through those beings that he's created.
But also through the symbiote Hivemind, anyone

606
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:50,092
who's come into contact with the symbiote, a
copy of their brain is basically uploaded to

607
00:56:50,132 --> 00:56:54,774
the Hivemind as a codex. So he has access to
all that information as well. Which is wild.

608
00:56:55,195 --> 00:56:59,597
Honestly, both of these characters are really
cool. Like, I feel like the White Lantern Ring

609
00:56:59,637 --> 00:57:05,128
is the ultimate weapon in DC. and the Necro
Sword is like the ultimate weapon in Marvel.

610
00:57:05,649 --> 00:57:11,193
Again, really close matchup. I would say that
the Necro Sword is probably secondary to the

611
00:57:11,213 --> 00:57:15,157
Infinity Gauntlet, which is the ultimate weapon
in Marvel and would totally stomp all over

612
00:57:15,257 --> 00:57:19,220
a white lantern ring, but that's neither here
nor there. It's also cheating. I'm talking

613
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:24,125
about like a real weapon, not like a cheater's
weapon. Okay, okay. Oh, I could do anything,

614
00:57:24,145 --> 00:57:29,309
ah. Considering all these stats, Jonathan, who
do you think is gonna be the winner of this

615
00:57:29,329 --> 00:57:33,750
match? Well, White Lantern for sure. The stats
are really close, but I think he'll come out

616
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:39,092
on top. Now, Instagram disagrees with me. The
poll is fresh. Like it definitely hasn't hit

617
00:57:39,132 --> 00:57:45,954
the full 24 hours, but it looks like Null has
a pretty strong lead at the start with a 62%

618
00:57:45,974 --> 00:57:50,535
favorability amongst our Instagram poll takers.
Well, let's see if they're right. I think they're

619
00:57:50,575 --> 00:58:02,090
right. AG9K, the results, please. Hey, Yuasa.
OK, the winner between White Lantern, and Null,

620
00:58:02,351 --> 00:58:14,357
the king in black, is... White's Lantern. Yes!
What? Yes! Really? Who is this guy? Uh, motherfucking

621
00:58:14,437 --> 00:58:22,081
Kyle Rayner, my boy. I don't know what this
shit is, but uh, White Lantern won 522 matches

622
00:58:22,242 --> 00:58:30,786
out of the 1000 simulations, whereas Null only
won 478. In the end, really, It was White Lantern's

623
00:58:30,846 --> 00:58:38,609
versatility, his speed, and the fact that Null
is vulnerable to light-based attacks that really

624
00:58:38,649 --> 00:58:43,792
put him over the edge. Even though Null has
proven to be extremely resilient against things

625
00:58:43,812 --> 00:58:49,074
like the Power Cosmic and Thor's lightning,
it's those things that do him in. That's right!

626
00:58:49,314 --> 00:58:55,196
That's right! So proud of my boy Kyle, he's
been my boy since the 90s. Null is just new

627
00:58:55,497 --> 00:59:00,947
and lame, and this podcast proves it. Null is
definitely one of the better new characters

628
00:59:00,987 --> 00:59:05,830
that Marvel has produced over the past decade
or so. Definitely the best villain. I hope

629
00:59:05,890 --> 00:59:10,193
people who are new to the character at least
got that impression through his backstory and

630
00:59:10,233 --> 00:59:14,816
his powers and everything like that. He really
didn't deserve to go down like this to some

631
00:59:14,876 --> 00:59:19,619
punk-ass kid named Kyle. I mean, really? I just
feel like Cartman right now. I just want to

632
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:26,400
be like, shut up, Kyle! You shut your mouth,
fatass! Null is definitely not a Cartman. He's

633
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:30,527
like one of the skinniest characters out there.
He's like Slenderman but with long hair. Kinda,

634
00:59:30,587 --> 00:59:35,174
and you know, just badass powers and shit. Anyway,
that is it for this duel guys. Let's get this

641
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,003
Agatha all along season one. I actually haven't
started watching the show. I wanted to wait

642
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:22,067
to binge it. So it'd be fresh in my mind as
I was reviewing it. But I have been waiting

643
01:00:22,107 --> 01:00:27,210
on pins and needles to start this thing. I cannot
wait. I can wait. I haven't started it either,

644
01:00:27,270 --> 01:00:32,894
but I'm not looking forward to the show at all.
