00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,340
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi and welcome
to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,020
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:37,020
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm its twin

4
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,320
brother Johnny DC. And in this episode, we are
going to review the latest Marvel Studios film

5
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,000
that hit theaters, Thunderbolts, Asterisk. And
no, the Asterisk was not just a stand-in for a

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,700
butthole. It did in fact have meaning that we will
discuss later on this episode. If you did not see

7
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:59,400
the movie, don't spoil yourself on what the
Asterisk meant. Go see the film and then come back

8
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,600
and listen to our spoiler review. I really liked
the Thunderbolts. It's probably my new favorite

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,360
Marvel movie. Well, don't give away the whole
show. Save your thoughts on the movie for when we

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,580
discuss the movie. I just said I liked it. I didn't
give anything away. Way to go, Jonathan.

11
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,780
Everybody's tuning out now because you're
dumbass. Please stay with us, guys. Because

12
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,080
before we talk about the movie, we're going to
break down the latest comic book movie news this

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,820
past week, of which there was just one major news
item. We learned that Ryan Reynolds is writing an

14
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,100
X-Men movie for the MCU, which will feature
Deadpool. An all-Marvel episode. As always, we

26
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,940
simulate battles between popular video game
characters. In yesterday's episode, they

27
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:48,740
speculated on who would win in a fight between
Isaac Clarke from Dead Space versus Pfft Rittus,

28
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:57,660
R-T-A-S, Vadom from Halo. Oh god, I'm gonna get
butchered for that. Ritas Vadom. Or Vadom. Vadom?

29
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:04,980
Is it Vadom? I don't know, please be gentle. Fans.
Over on the Max Destruction podcast, hosts Scotty

30
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,720

on a brief season break currently, so now's the
perfect time to get caught up with their past

32
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:19,720
episodes. And on the Senjou World podcast, host
Zachary Hepburn speculates on fights between fan

33
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,820
favorite anime and manga characters. On
Thursday, Isaac is gonna reveal who would win

34
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,440
between Sunraku from Shangri-La Frontier versus
Kirito from Sword Art Online. Visit

quick to the no prize. A no prize is an award that

37
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,640
Marvely used to give out to fans. Our version, the
Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award that we

38
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,140
post on Instagram for the person that we feel gave
the best answer to our question of the week. Last

39
00:03:54,140 --> 00:04:00,240
week, we asked you guys, for those of you who have
seen both films, which was better? 2009's

40
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:06,860
Watchmen or Thunderbolts and why? And we asked
this because last week's episode was a team duel

41
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:13,360
where we found out who would win in a fight between
the Watchmen and the Thunderbolts. So we kind of

42
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,500
continued it into the film space. We didn't get a
whole lot of answers, we just got two, largely

43
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,180
because there were only so many people out there
listening that could give a valid answer to this

44
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:29,480
question in time. Our first honorable mention
goes to John Sturrosky, who said, It's John

45
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:34,860
Sturrosky here. So you guys are asking which is
better, Thunderbolts or Watchmen? And to be

46
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,020
perfectly honest, I can't say either of them is
better than the other one because it's comparing

47
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:45,380
apples to oranges. And Watchmen, you've got a
universe where the real heroes that we know from

48
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:51,700
the DC universe don't exist. And Thunderbolts,
it's incorporated into the mainstream universe.

49
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:57,360
Again, apples to oranges, they're both fantastic
movies though, so let's just get along. John, what

50
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:05,300
do you think this podcast is all about? You gotta
take a side. Now, I know on the Discord, your server

51
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:11,180
name is JohnTheFence because you say that you sit
on the fence between both sides. But as you know, we

52
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:17,220
like to make all of our patrons pick a side between
Marvel and DC. And as the wise man once said, he who

53
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:24,280
sits on the fence has a stick up his butt. Yes, I have
heard the saying and I 100% agree with it. Yes, so

54
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:30,400
John gave pretty much a non-answer something
about, Oh, one's in a universe and one's not. I'm

55
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:37,180
not sure what that has to do with the quality of each
film, but Watchmen was clearly the correct answer

56
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:41,200
here. Actually, that was Thunderbolts. But you
know, he's saying we're comparing apples to

57
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:47,820
oranges. Here's the thing, John, oranges are way
better than apples. Fuck oranges. Orange juice.

58
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,840
Orange juice is fucking delicious, right? You can
like segment it off, you know, in little pieces.

59
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,100
Hell yeah, it's a way more versatile fruit.
Oranges all the way. Except with apples, you get

60
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:04,300
apple jam, which is way better than orange jam. You
get apple soda again, way better than orange soda.

61
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,520
Demand. Apples are clearly the superior fruit.
Wait, wait, wait, what the fuck is apple soda? I've

62
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,760
heard of orange soda. Have you never had an apple
soda? I think maybe I did at one point, but then I

63
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,540
blocked it from my memory because it sucked. You
are a cultured piece of shit. Guys, are you team

64
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,540
Apple or team Orange? Let us know in the comments.
Thanks for the answer, John. But the winner of this

65
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:32,300
week's No Price is Lorenzo Valdez. Who said? This
is Lorenzo Valdez. I just got back to my condo after

66
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:38,300
watching Thunderbolts and I really enjoyed it.
Florence Pugh is awesome. The most of the humor

67
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:44,260
really worked for me, but I can't say it's better
than Watchmen. I mean, Watchmen is such a

68
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:52,580
beautiful, elegant, thought-provoking, at
times, satirical, epic. And I love Watchmen. Clon

69
00:06:52,580 --> 00:07:00,660
of Forever and Always. Bye-bye. And I love this
answer. Watchmen is all of those things and more.

70
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:06,740
Don't get me wrong, Thunderbolts is good, but it's
just not at the same caliber as Watchmen. The film

71
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:12,440
by Zack Snyder is literally a piece of art. It's his
tour de force, in my opinion. The way everything

72
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:19,160
looked combined with the music, combined with the
acting, combined with the story overall. Muah,

73
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,440
Chef's kiss. Oh, I'm sorry that the Thunderbolts
movie didn't have enough swinging blue dong for

74
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:29,460
you guys. For a great answer, Lorenzo, you win this
week's no prize, I guess. If you, the listener,

75
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,900
want to shout out winning your own no prize, stay
tuned to later on this episode, when we'll be

76
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:37,580
asking another question of the week. I gotta say
something. And now that that's done, you're not

77
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:49,160
gonna let me say anything. On to the news. Alright,
this past week we learned that Ryan Reynolds has

78
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:55,480
been tasked with developing treatments for a
Deadpool slash X-Men team-up movie. Now, he's

79
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,160
gone on the record before as saying that there's
probably not gonna be another Deadpool solo

80
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,340
movie. I mean, Deadpool and Wolverine wasn't a
Deadpool solo movie. You know, he shared billing

81
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,480
with Wolverine, but it's likely that there's not
gonna be like another standalone Deadpool film.

82
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,080
It's gonna be more along the lines of an ensemble
piece with other mutant characters. Largely,

83
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,940
this is happening because, you know, Deadpool and
Wolverine grossed over a billion dollars at the

84
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:24,040
box office. And that has made Ryan Reynolds
probably one of the most lucrative talents

85
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,540
working with Marvel Studios at this time. We don't
know too much about the movie other than a few

86
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:33,500
details that the Hollywood Reporter released,
including the news that the movie is only going to

87
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:39,940
feature three or four X-Men characters within its
lineup with Deadpool playing a character on the

88
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:45,440
sidelines as a worm. Alright, so he's not one of the
three or four characters? Correct. So it's gonna

89
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,700
be Deadpool and Wolverine and somebody and
somebody and somebody is a way to look at this.

90
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:56,500
Well, how do you feel about this? Because, I mean,
technically Deadpool and Wolverine, I guess, was

91
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:04,500
in the MCU. But this will kind of officially be the
MCU's like first X-Men movie, like a team movie.

92
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:09,180
Well, we don't know that for sure because there's
another X-Men movie in the works that's being

93
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:15,800
written by Michael Leslie, who wrote the Hunger
Games films. So that film is an X-Men film that's

94
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:23,660
different from this Ryan Reynolds Deadpool X-Men
movie. Oh, OK. So either that X-Men movie is gonna

95
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:29,380
come before this Deadpool team up or Deadpool's
gonna come first. I think what I would like to see as

96
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:35,040
a fan thinking about what X-Men storylines
Deadpool has been a part of, I think I'd like to see

97
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:43,460
the Deadpool team up movie come first and then lead
into the first official Marvel X-Men film. And if

98
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:49,020
they adapted the Messiah complex through the
Messiah War storyline where we see the first

99
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:55,560
mutant being born and how cable and Deadpool and
basically all the mutants are striving to either

100
00:09:55,560 --> 00:10:00,740
protect or kill or use this child who ends up being
Hope Summers. I think that's a pretty good

101
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:06,960
foundation story leading into the revelation
that mutants exist in this post-secret wars

102
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:12,420
Marvel Universe. I don't know about that. For one,
it's kind of paradoxical that they're mutants

103
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:19,800
hunting the first mutant. But also, I feel like the
sooner we get to a like established Xavier school

104
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:26,280
with Professor X and Cyclops and Jean Grey at
least, the better. That's true. I mean, honestly,

105
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:32,120
in terms of how they release these films, I could go
either way. I think, yes, it would be better to have

106
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,880
all the classic X-Men elements in place prior to a
new Deadpool team up movie. But if you were to put

107
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,420
the new Deadpool movie up first, I think there's a
way to adapt the Messiah complex there. And that

108
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,680
way you'd be able to bring back cable and you'd have
Bishop and you could probably have Wolverine back

109
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:55,080
with Hugh Jackman. Tilly's fucking 90. This is all
speculation, but I will be really interested in

110
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,600
seeing which of these X-Men films comes out first.
I think it's really smart to continue to use Ryan

111
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,280
Reynolds and the Deadpool character. I know the
audiences, including myself, are not really done

112
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:09,800
seeing films with him. I hope yet he continues
doing this until he's 90 because the cinematic

113
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,160
character of Deadpool is just such a national
treasure. So unique. I'm pretty glad Ryan

114
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:21,080
Reynolds is getting this win. I think he's a
marketing and writing genius. So I think this

115
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,040
project is in good hands with him. I agree. But
since we don't know who's going to be in this

116
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:35,700
Deadpool X-Men team up movie, that brings us to our
question of the week. Including Deadpool, what

117
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,900
should be the roster for the X-Men Deadpool team up
film? Again, we're looking for three to four

118
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,820
characters because that's the number that the
Hollywood Reporter gave. So we want to know who you

119
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,820
would like to see in that film. Recording your

125
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:34,200
them afraid. He's got a motorcycle. Get after him
or have you shot? You mean blow up the building.

From this moment on, none of your safe. New
episodes every Wednesday, wherever you get your

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:48,060
podcasts. But that does it for all the news for this
episode, so let's go ahead and get into our main

128
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:58,000
event, where we review the latest Marvel Studios
film to hit theaters, Thunderbolts. Astros.

129
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:14,880
Thunderbolts. Thunderbolts was directed by Jake
Schreer and stars Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan,

130
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,180
David Harbour, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Wyatt
Russell, Hannah John-Cammond, and Lewis

131
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:24,500
Pullman. The film is the fifth and final film of
Marvel's Phase 5, though we won't completely be

132
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,440
out of this phase until the Iron Heart television
series, which will be released in June. And then

133
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,720
Phase 6 will start in July with the Fantastic Four
for Steps Movie. One of my bigger takeaways

134
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:40,600
walking out of the movie was that there were little
to no surprises in the film plot-wise. I think even

135
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,100
in the confines of this podcast, just us
speculating on the film based on the trailers, you

136
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:51,340
and I guessed most of what the movie would be, say
for the end credits scene. It's not a complicated

137
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:57,340
film with a complex story. That being said, if you
haven't seen it yet, I would still recommend going

138
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,400
to go see it because it's worth it. Just because the
plot is simple doesn't mean that the movie is not

139
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,420
good. Go see the movie, then come back and listen to
our spoiler review. It also doesn't mean that the

140
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,480
movie is not a spectacle that should be watched on
the biggest screen possible. Yeah, there's a lot

141
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:17,140
of practical action in this movie. It foregoes CGI
a lot, and I think that was pretty cool to see on the

142
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:22,280
big screen. So yeah, I'm starting out by saying
that the plot is simple and straightforward, but

143
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,420
the story is simple in the way something like
Reservoir Dogs is. That is to say, the plot is

144
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:33,340
uncomplicated, but the characters are anything
but. The film really is more of a character study in

145
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:38,600
that it takes these very unique, established,
anti-heroic characters and spends its time

146
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:44,100
exploring who they are and how they interact more
than doing stuff like expositing or world

147
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,260
building. That's pretty unique for a Marvel
Studios project, and so right off the bat, the film

148
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,940
has an identity that's all its own that sets it
apart from its contemporaries. Where you could

149
00:14:53,940 --> 00:15:00,380
describe the typical Marvel film as, you know,
exciting, funny, action-packed, flashy. The

150
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:05,680
Thunderbolts film could be described as more
authentic, snappy, you know, it's nuanced, it's

151
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,680
mature. It's still loads of fun, though. And I'm
not going to say that these descriptors make

152
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,740
Thunderbolts better than other Marvel films if
there are people out there thinking that I'm

153
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,560
knocking your average Marvel fare, but I do think
that it's fresher and therefore more important

154
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,680
for the genre as a whole, which seems to be flagging
among general audiences, you know, and could use

155
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:31,240
some fresh material like this movie. Yeah, this is
very different from, say, Captain America Brave

156
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:37,320
New World, which felt more like a typical Marvel
film to me. Thunderbolts is exactly what I was

157
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:43,240
hoping would come from Marvel Studios,
considering we're kind of experiencing a genre of

158
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,980
fatigue amongst the film-going audiences
currently. And I think this was a really smart

159
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:54,460
release on behalf of Marvel. And probably a cheap
one, too. I mean, there's really only two, like,

160
00:15:54,460 --> 00:16:00,560
major locations throughout the entire film,
which surprised me. Yeah, there's the Ox Vault in,

161
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,360
like, Utah, and then there's the Watchtower in
Manhattan. And really, the film takes place over a

162
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,780
matter of hours, if not, like a day or so. Again, the
story is pretty straightforward, and in that

163
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:15,280
regard, I think, less is more. It gave us time to
really sit down and observe these incredibly

164
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:20,920
complex characters in a way that we normally
wouldn't otherwise if they're, you know, like the

165
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:26,240
Eternals circumventing the globe and setting up
all this backstory and world-building for the

166
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:31,300
future. The movie, in effect, is almost the
Anti-Eternals. That's exactly what I was

167
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:36,100
thinking as I was walking out of the theater.
Really? Just comparing the Century to someone

168
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:41,500
like Icarus, I was like, man, I kind of wish the
Eternals didn't come out until, like, years from

169
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,900
now, as opposed to when it did, because it kind of
ruined a lot of future Marvel films, in a way, I

170
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:54,160
think, because it was just so large in scale and
would obviously affect the larger Marvel world in

171
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:58,780
a way that they probably weren't ready for. To me,
the Century was much more interesting of a

172
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:04,339
character than Icarus was. Yeah, I totally agree.
That being said, I also liked Eternals. I liked how

173
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:08,800
kind of existential it was and how it also took a
different approach to the superhero genre,

174
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:13,500
albeit, you know, a less successful one. You know,
we did have someone on the Discord, and I can't

175
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,319
remember off the top of my head who, so I'm sorry for
not giving credit where credit is due, but someone

176
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:25,099
posited that perhaps the Golden Century Serum
that was created by Project Century in this movie

177
00:17:25,099 --> 00:17:29,840
used a bit of like Eternals DNA or something in
there, in conjunction with the Super Soldier

178
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,940
Serum, because the way the Century would
sometimes glow golden was semi-reminiscent of

179
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:41,400
how the Eternals powers would manifest visually.
Yeah, we never quite learned how they developed

180
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,520
the Century Superpowers, did we? No, I mean, it's
just as vague as it was in the comic books, you know,

181
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,460
where the government was trying to recreate the
Super Soldier Serum, and so they outsourced it to a

182
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,360
bunch of subcontractors, and then this high
school chemist professor ended up cracking the

183
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,880
case, and then one of his students, Bob Reynolds,
broke into his lab and then drank the formula in an

184
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:04,420
attempt to get high. You know, they don't go too
much into the specifics into, you know, what went

185
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,860
into the cauldron, as it were. We just know that it
worked. And actually, one of the things I really

186
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:15,820
like about this film is how I didn't feel that
despite all these different characters having

187
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,000
all of these different histories from other
Marvel projects, like films and television

188
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,880
series, that it felt like I needed to do homework
before watching it. Like, honestly, I feel like

189
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,820
this could have been the first Marvel film I had
ever seen, and I still would have mostly

190
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:34,380
understood everything. It was very standalone in
that way. For sure. I mean, the film is somewhat a

191
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:39,880
quasi-sequel to the first Black Widow film, but it
also continues the story from the Captain America

192
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,840
franchise and the Falcon and the Winter Soldier
and Ant-Man and the Wasp. But nowadays, you know,

193
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,760
that's not too much homework compared to some of
the other Marvel films that have come out. This

194
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:53,540
movie was less interested in continuity, and
really, it seems like The Thunderbolts was made by

195
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:58,920
people who were less interested in the MCU as a
whole, less interested in, you know, CGI and the

196
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:04,720
colorful spectacle, and they were more
interested in practical action, grounded tones.

197
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,760
They were less concerned with the big players and
more interested in creating these portraits of

198
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:14,460
the universe's more sidelined characters. And
that's to the film's benefit and detriment, I

199
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:18,140
think, because on one hand, you get these
interesting explorations of themes like

200
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:23,400
depression and introspection, but on the other
hand, you have a film that treats some characters

201
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:29,380
like Taskmaster and Songbird with such apathy for
the source material that they probably didn't

202
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:34,640
even need to be in the film to begin with. As a fan,
mostly as a comic book fan, that sucks. Yeah,

203
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,260
Taskmaster was definitely done dirty here. I
don't understand why they chose to even include

204
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,560
her honestly, and regarding Songbird, I didn't
even know that was Songbird, or I wouldn't have

205
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,660
known if you would not have mentioned it like last
episode. For sure, yeah, they were both done

206
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:54,040
dirty. Like, Taskmaster was included in the
marketing material, but she really only had one

207
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,120
line of dialogue this film and probably under a
minute of action, and she was badass in the minute

208
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:03,120
that she had. You know, I understand that fans were
disappointed with the revelation in the Black

209
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,060
Widow film that Taskmaster was Antonia Drakov,
but like, wasn't the character at the very least

210
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:13,520
worth redemption? And at the most, wasn't she
still a fucking badass? I think considering

211
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:19,360
Taskmaster's backstory in the MCU and her power
set, and even, you know, the actor who plays her,

212
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,160
Olga Korylenko, I think she would have made for an
interesting conclusion into this story. And

213
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,140
yeah, the filmmakers may say that they took her out
early in order to set the stakes for the film, but

214
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:34,400
they treated her death as an afterthought. Like,
there was like little to no impact there to even

215
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:39,060
make those stakes feel earned. Like, if they were
going to kill her as a way to set the stakes, they

216
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:43,040
should have had the Void killer during his fight
with the Thunderbolts in order to increase the

217
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:47,420
stakes there. Like, that would have been
impactful. Yeah, or the Void accidentally killed

218
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:52,080
her during their escape from the vault. Like, she
fell down the elevator shaft or something like

219
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,740
that. Something like that. That would have been
more shocking than what happened. And as for

220
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,400
Songbird, like, I thought they included Melissa
Gold in this film because she was eventually going

221
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,520
to become the hero's Songbird, even if it was at the
end as an end credit stinger or something. Like,

222
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:10,760
how do you include who is perhaps the most iconic
and tenured member of the Thunderbolts from the

223
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:17,500
comics and not have her in this movie with her sonic
powers or any reference to her heroic persona?

224
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,880
Like, the Melissa Gold character in this film
could have been literally anybody. Her name could

225
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,000
have been like Trixie Tinklemuffin or whatever,
and the movie would have been exactly the same.

226
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,660
It's like putting Harley Quinn in a Suicide Squad
film and then just making her an assistant to

227
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:37,040
Amanda Waller. Well, I think it would have been
like her as Harley and Quinzel sort of setting up

228
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:42,080
the character. That's what I got from this film. I
got no impression that we were ever going to see

229
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,160
that assistant Melissa character again ever. I
mean, when Valentina said that she was getting a

230
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:51,780
lesson in loyalty or something like that, I
thought there she was going to get like her sonic

231
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:56,440
powers, but then nothing came of that. I'm not sure
it really would have fit into the film though.

232
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,160
Maybe not, but like again, even as an end credit
stinger, something like that. You just can't put

233
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:06,080
the most iconic Thunderbolts member from the
comics in this movie and not have any reference to

234
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:10,520
Songbird whatsoever. Yeah, I guess they could
have done that instead of the Wheaties box thing.

235
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,360
Yeah, exactly. That was funny though. It's kind of
like they put Songbird in this movie for

236
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:20,920
fanservice and then forgot to service us. Oh,
shit. Like what's the opposite of fanservice? Fan

237
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,980
disrespect. There you go. There you go. I feel very
disrespected as a fan. In the grand scheme of the

238
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:31,520
film though, those gripes could be considered
nitpicking probably. I don't want my bitching to

239
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:37,060
negate the big thematic swings that the film took
in terms of things like self loathing and mental

240
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:41,880
health and what heroism looks like for people who
do not see themselves as heroes. That's stuff

241
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:46,100
that's not really explored in a lot of other
superhero movies. Yeah, exactly. You mentioned

242
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:50,820
that the film felt like it was made by people who
were less interested in the MCU and more

243
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:56,140
interested in the characters. I kind of felt like
it was made by people who were more interested in

244
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:01,800
theme. And like you mentioned, the whole theme
here is pretty much mental illness. Yeah, it's a

245
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,460
big one. You know, heroism is also a major theme. I
like what the film had to say about all of that

246
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:12,320
because like, you know, we've gotten projects
with anti-heroes in them, like The Punisher or

247
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:18,520
Black Adam, but it's rare to see a project with an
anti-hero questioning whether they could be an

248
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:24,780
actual hero. And I think that's fascinating.
Like, what if The Punisher felt guilty over his use

249
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:30,480
of guns and instead picked up a shield? What if
Black Adam took notes from Shazam? How would it

250
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,560
speak to their tragic histories? How would it
redefine them as characters? Like, I'm not saying

251
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:39,300
that all anti-heroes should go through this
journey. They shouldn't, you know, betray who

252
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:43,820
they are. But going from an anti-hero to a hero, I
think, is a pretty interesting thought

253
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,280
experiment that they did well here in The
Thunderbolts. Yeah, it's one that Bucky, I feel

254
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:53,800
like, has been going through for a long time and
seeing that other characters in the MCU could

255
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:58,280
relate with that and kind of go on that journey with
him. Even though the film primarily focuses on

256
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:04,320
Yelena, I thought that was a cool dynamic and good
for a team of characters within Marvel.

257
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,720
Absolutely. I want to talk more about that in the
character breakdown, but before we get there, I do

258
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,720
want to touch on the asterisk. The asterisk pretty
much meant what we all thought it would mean in that

259
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,320
The Thunderbolts team was not really The
Thunderbolts, but actually a New Avengers team.

260
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,420
Like, when I saw that on the screen, I was like, oh
yeah, called it, but it made me think that you have

261
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:29,360
to admire Marvel's tenacity in not marketing this
film as a New Avengers movie. Because I think

262
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:34,720
calling this movie New Avengers probably would
have accounted for a bigger box office opening. I

263
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,960
mean, this movie got a decent box office, but, you
know, The Thunderbolts name is not a household

264
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:45,120
brand like The Avengers is. They could have easily
called this movie New Avengers, and they chose not

265
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:50,400
to, for the sake of art, we'll say. And I think
that's pretty admirable. Although I think the

266
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,500
whole thing was made moot by the end credits scene
where it's revealed that, oh hey, they're not

267
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:02,140
actually The New Avengers. So they really are The
Thunderbolts. They are The New Avengers. They're

268
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:09,060
just not the only Avengers out there. They're
Avengers with a Z, right? Oh my gosh. I mean, it

269
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:13,320
happened in the comic books where you had
simultaneous Avengers teams going, especially

270
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,520
around the events of Norman Osborn's Hammer
Organization, where he had his Avengers team, and

271
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:23,520
then you had the mighty Avengers, led by Luke Cage.
So this dilemma is not without precedence within

272
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,740
the comic book. They were really fighting over,
like, who was the true bearers of the Avengers

273
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:32,680
legacy, and I think that's an interesting thing to
explore. But you didn't answer my question about

274
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:39,480
Marvel's boldness in how they chose to market this
film. Slow clap for Marvel. Thank you. Slow clap.

275
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:48,800
Yeah. I don't really give a shit. Well, you're just
a sellout, so whatever. Well, okay. I have no idea

276
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,620
what that means, but sure. Let's go to move on to our
character breakdown. Starting with Black Widow,

277
00:25:54,620 --> 00:26:00,320
a.k .a. Yelena Belova, played by Florence Pugh.
Now Florence Pugh is such an interesting Yelena

278
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,620
Belova, largely because of how, like, deadpan and
dry she is as an actress. I'm not sure if any other

279
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:11,720
actor could pull this version of Yelena off like
she does. I think it makes her more interesting

280
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,960
than a lot of her peers, including, dare I say it,
Scarlett Johansson as the Black Widow. In that

281
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,880
Yelena has a lot more going for her
personality-wise in that she's funny, but she's

282
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:28,080
also flawed. She's also very endearing. She goes
in this movie from being in a very deep depression

283
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,100
to refinding herself in a new family, The
Thunderbolts, that's not too dissimilar from the

284
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:39,580
family she had as a kid with Natasha and Melina and
Alexi. It's Alexi who helps her see past her own

285
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:44,760
flaws that she only sees in herself and helps her
realize that she's already more of a hero than she

286
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,180
likely ever thought she could be. I thought that
was a fascinating journey. It's interesting to

287
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:54,640
hear you say that you think Yelena Belova is more
interesting than Natasha. Right when you said

288
00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:00,080
that, I was like, is that true? And I think it is,
actually, because they really had a fight to give

289
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,820
Natasha a personality in a film like Avengers Age
of Ultron with the backstory that, oh, she's sad

290
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:12,240
because she can't have children. But it's like
that kind of felt like it was a few films too late, I

291
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,520
suppose. Whereas with Yelena, you're right,
she's a lot more funny than Scarlett Johansson's

292
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:23,540
Black Widow. And I love just the tragic backstory
that they continue to expand upon for the

293
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:28,100
character. Well, I mean, Yelena's backstory is
the same as Natasha's backstory, right? So

294
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,540
they're very similar characters in that regard.
They both grew up in the red room and had to go

295
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:37,180
through horrible things to get where they are. But
Yelena's personality manifested a little bit

296
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:41,340
differently than Natasha's. You know, I think
Scarlett Johansson's character was well used in

297
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:47,320
films like The Winter Soldier or Civil War or even
her own film Black Widow. I think it was nice to get

298
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,300
the differences between the two sisters there.
But I don't think anyone would deny that Florence

299
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:58,100
Pugh's Yelena Belova is just a terribly
fascinating character. She's more spunky. Yeah.

300
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:03,040
Let's move on to The Winter Soldier, aka Bucky
Barnes, played by Sebastian Stan. You know,

301
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:07,820
Sebastian Stan's great as always as the
character. Here, Bucky really serves as the team

302
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:13,480
leader. You know, he's the precedent for taking
your sins from the past and transforming them from

303
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:19,860
a source of guilt to an impetus for change. He is the
template from which the rest of the characters can

304
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:24,320
base their journey off of because he's been
through it. And what's interesting is that here,

305
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,680
his journey takes him to Congress where he serves
as a representative for the New York City area,

306
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:35,200
which I thought was interesting. It was a strange
choice considering, I don't think, political

307
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,280
diplomacy and blowing up bad guys really go hand in
hand. And really, I'd be shocked if he was still a

308
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,400
congressman by the time we see him next as a new
Avenger, which makes me wonder why they even

309
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:52,660
bothered to put Bucky into politics to begin with.
I wouldn't say it was 100% necessary for this film.

310
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:58,140
It kind of seems like an element that they wanted to
explore early on, but then just kind of abandoned

311
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:03,360
while writing the script. But I think they
explained that he, by joining the Thunderbolts

312
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,800
team, pretty much resigned his role as a
congressman. Yeah, I think they did say that. It

313
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:14,660
was implied at least by Valentina. Right. To me, I
thought Bucky was sort of the least interesting

314
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:20,520
character in this film. I don't know if it's
because we've gone through his whole arc pretty

315
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,900
much already, but it also kind of felt like
Sebastian Stan was kind of just going through the

316
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:29,160
motions with the role. I mean, that's the Bucky
character, you know, he's tired. He's been

317
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,440
through a lot. He's fucking 100 years old. And
yeah, he's probably gone through most of his

318
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,420
journey, but it is nice to see him taking up the
torch for other characters in his place. That's

319
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,540
definitely an interesting direction to take the
Winter Soldier. I hope that as a member of the New

320
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:46,600
Avenger, The Avengers. They give his arm all the
cool upgrades that he has in the comic books like

321
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:51,800
the Metal Spike, the Taser arm, and like the
Flamethrower. I think that'd be pretty badass.

322
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:57,100
Let's go ahead and move on to US Agent, aka John
Walker, played by Wyatt Russell. Wyatt Russell

323
00:29:57,100 --> 00:30:03,800
does a great job of playing the guy that you love to
hate to love. His John Walker is so believably a

324
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,640
douchey asshole, yet somehow still charismatic
enough to make you root for him as US Agent. I think

325
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,340
it's because he fills his performance with enough
insecurity behind his facade that you know that

326
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:19,320
he's not actually coming from a place of arrogance
necessarily, but from a place of deep hurt. And I

327
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:24,240
think that makes him endearing. His whole arc was
about wanting to be a hero that could live up to the

328
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,040
legacy of Captain America and he failed in The
Falcon and the Winter Soldier show. He failed in

329
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:34,240
his eyes and he failed in the public eye. So by the
end of that show, he became more of an agent for

330
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,460
Valentina and by the end of this film, he's
stepping back into that hero role and you could

331
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:43,340
tell he was a little bit reticent to go back there,
but he did it anyway because that's probably his

332
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:48,660
calling. Yeah, next to Yelena, he was probably my
favorite character in the film. I didn't really

333
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:52,900
like him in The Falcon and the Winter Soldier
because of how much of a douchebag he was, but

334
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:57,620
somehow, yeah, you're right, that made him
endearing in this movie and relatable in a way

335
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:02,200
because, you know, as a father, I'm probably
guilty of looking at my phone when I should

336
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,200
probably be interacting with my daughter. So that
kind of cut deep. Oh, yeah, I think as parents

337
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,880
nowadays, we've all done that, but his big mistake
was that he left his family. Oh, I thought they left

338
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:17,460
him. Yeah, one of those two things, but it just
added to the tragedy because like Ghost was asking

339
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:22,060
Kim how he balanced it all and he's just like, you do
what you got to do. And then later on, it was

340
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:27,540
revealed as they were chained up in the garage that
he wasn't even a family man anymore. He didn't have

341
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:32,740
everything. He didn't have it all. A quick note
here. I really love how by when the end credits came

342
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:38,680
along, he still had his shield taco. It was like how
many months later after the events of this film was

343
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:43,540
the end credits and yet he was still sticking with
that bent shield almost like he had come to just

344
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:49,120
accept it. I thought that was hilarious. I thought
that was super dumb. I did not get that. Let's go

345
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:56,500
ahead and move on to the Sentry, aka Bob Reynolds,
played by Lewis Pullman. It sucks so much to see how

346
00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:01,780
much of a revelation Lewis Pullman was in this
role, to see how much nuance and believability the

347
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:06,640
actor brought to this very difficult role and yet
still wonder how Stephen Yuen would have pulled it

348
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:13,420
off. Oh, no, just watching this, I was like, this
actor was so perfect for this role. I am so glad they

349
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:18,420
replaced Stephen Yuen. I mean, it's Yuen's loss,
right? Because the Sentry has long been one of

350
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:24,420
Marvel's most psychologically complex heroes.
And it seems like such a meaty role for any actor to

351
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:29,580
sink his teeth into. Oh, yeah. I thought Pullman
brought layers to his performance with every

352
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:36,260
subtlety, every weird posture or shy smile or hand
twitch. I think he realistically portrayed

353
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:41,900
mental illness in a way that felt, I guess,
respectful for those who suffer from any

354
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:47,960
psychological affliction. It just felt real and
not like a caricature of mental illness. You know,

355
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,680
there were times where he was scary and there were
times where he was funny. There were times where he

356
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:57,180
was heartwrenchingly sympathetic. I think his
Bob Reynolds is by far one of the MCU's most

357
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:02,660
interesting characters. And I can see him growing
in the role in much the same way Tom Hiddleston did

358
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:07,460
as Loki, because there's just so much going on
behind the performance and so much space to

359
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:14,120
explore and to grow from here. I have never been a
big fan of the Sentry as a character. I always kind

360
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:22,300
of saw him as an April Fools Superman knockoff
character. But his performance made me really

361
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:28,780
appreciate aspects of the Sentry that I hadn't
really before. Yeah, the whole mental illness

362
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:34,460
thing is unique to the character, right? He is Bob
Reynolds, the addict. He is also the Sentry, the

363
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:39,500
all powerful hero. He is also the void, a soul
leading pit of darkness. I was surprised that they

364
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,540
went as hard into that as they did with this film. I
thought maybe they were just going to kind of

365
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:48,280
tangentially address that. But no, that whole
relationship of the beings that are the Sentry

366
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:53,680
kind of became the crux of the film. Oh, yeah, no,
absolutely. I mean, it was the stakes of the film.

367
00:33:53,680 --> 00:34:00,460
It was the climax of the film, them going up against
this dark side of the character. I jokingly texted

368
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:07,280
you right after I saw the movie saying that this
film was essentially an MCU version of My Little

369
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:13,600
Pony and the whole like friendship is magic thing.
And the bad guys defeated in the end by a group hug.

370
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:20,199
That said, they did an unbelievably good job of
making that work for the audience in a way that

371
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:25,600
surprised me. Well, I didn't know what you meant by
that My Little Pony text message that you sent me

372
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:33,340
because I'm not a brony like you. OK, I have two
daughters that are older than your daughter. I

373
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:38,280
still I have no idea what reference I've never
watched My Little Pony. So I don't know exactly

374
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,659
what you're saying. I'm saying everything was
solved by the power of friendship and a group hug at

375
00:34:43,659 --> 00:34:48,699
the end. It's not like they defeat the void in the
comic books in any less roundabout manner. In the

376
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:54,000
books, they have to defeat the void by essentially
making everybody forget about the Sentry and Bob

377
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,900
Reynolds and the void to begin with. There's no
easy solution there. You can't just take him down

378
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:03,780
by force. So I don't I don't begrudge the film
taking that kind of approach of the group hug,

379
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:09,680
where really they're trying to solve the issue of
the void through therapy, right? Well, I don't

380
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:14,880
begrudge it either. That's what I'm saying. I'm
saying like I feel like I should, but they did it so

381
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,360
well that I don't. Yeah. I mean, one of the main
themes of the movie was mental illness. So the fact

382
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:24,560
that it was therapy that helped solve everything.
I think that's what makes it work. What did you

383
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,420
think of the Sentry's powers in this movie?
Because they were a little bit different from what

384
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:34,220
they are in the comic. Yeah, they focused a lot more
on telekinesis, which is not really something

385
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:39,640
that I know the Sentry to have in the books. For the
void, they really focused on his telepathic

386
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,780
powers, which I thought was pretty interesting.
He was kind of like a psychic entity on the astral

387
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:48,720
plane, right? He was bringing all these people
into his astral realm where they would live out

388
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,000
their biggest regrets in life or their most
depressing moments or something like that. It was

389
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:57,320
different from what I know in the books, but I
wouldn't say that it's out of the concept for the

390
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:02,400
Sentry. You know, the Sentry is supposed to be this
all powerful being void is supposed to be this soul

391
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,920
sucking dark creature. I think it all works. In the
future, I would like to see them use less

392
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:12,460
telekinesis for the character and focus more on
his strength. I don't know if they were just doing

393
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:17,800
that in an attempt to make him seem less like
Superman or not, but it was strange to me. I want to

394
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:23,500
see them focus more on his light powers. Yes. Yeah,
that would be good. Let's move on to Red Guardian,

395
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:28,780
a.k .a. Alexi Shostakov, played by David Harbour.
I love David Harbour in this role. You know, we

396
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:34,320
mentioned he was great in the Black Widow movie,
mostly as comic relief. And he plays the role of

397
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,540
comic relief in this movie, too. But he also serves
as a beacon for the team and especially Yelena on

398
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:45,480
how to be a hero. He was the first one in Manhattan to
just do what was right and do what came naturally to

399
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:51,260
him by saving these people. And he seemed to see the
heroic side in his teammates and believed in them

400
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:56,180
more than they believed in themselves. And he
cheered them on. It was awesome. But his arc was

401
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:01,200
interesting in that, you know, you can view it
cynically because I was trying to think about what

402
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,980
his motivations were. And you could say that he was
pushing a heroic agenda on these people so that he

403
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:11,060
could selfishly live out his old glory days. But I
think when you look at David Harbour's

404
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:16,540
performance, it kind of pushes that cynicism away
because there's such honesty to his optimism and

405
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:22,680
in his lovable buffoonery. Yeah, he's just
excited about being a hero and helping people.

406
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,200
There's perks that come with it, and he definitely
takes advantage of those. Like the Weedies box.

407
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:33,840
Yeah, exactly. But I also felt like he genuinely
wants to help. Yeah, he was a great mentor figure in

408
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:38,800
this movie. And I liked him here a lot more than I did
in the Black Widow movie. There he kind of got

409
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,900
annoying to me. And I thought he was going to be
annoying in this film as well. But I was just

410
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:49,980
surprised to think about how well he helped direct
Yelena's arc through the conversations he had

411
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:55,440
with her at the beginning. And right before the
climax, it worked really well. I don't think David

412
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,800
Harbour was annoying in the Black Widow film. I
thought it was great. I did think his character was

413
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:05,500
annoying in the What If episode that he shared with
Bucky. I think the dynamic that we got between the

414
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:10,180
Winter Soldier and the Red Guardian in this movie
was better than that entire What If episode. Oh,

415
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:16,020
yeah. Regarding his look, it was nice to see him
cleaned up during the Weedies mid-credits scene.

416
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:21,060
But then by the time the end credits scene rolled
around, he was back to having a completely shaped

417
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:26,120
head with a really long wild man beard. So I thought
that was a little bit weird the way they jumped

418
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:31,420
between his looks from the movie to the
mid-credits scene to the end credits scene. The

419
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:36,220
inconsistency just was strange. Yeah, all of
those characters had interesting looks in the

420
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:42,180
final end credits scene. I didn't really care for
any of them, honestly. Really? Yeah. They all look

421
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:48,180
like wigs, right? Right. It was just a little too
polished, a little too like 70s. I don't know.

422
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:52,660
Well, that's how they'll look in the upcoming
Avengers Doomsday movie because the end credits

423
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:58,760
scene was filmed on that set. Let's go ahead and
move on to Ghost, a.k .a. Ava Star, played by Hannah

424
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:07,660
John-Kamen. So Ghost was a character that
appeared in this film. Yeah, she didn't really

425
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:13,800
contribute to anything too much other than
getting them out of the vault. Yeah, I feel like

426
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:18,720
there's not a whole lot to say about Ghost. She
seemed really just along for the ride, for the most

427
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,800
part, without any notable motivations or
character building. We do know from Ant-Man and

428
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:28,920
the Wasp that she had a painful childhood with her
chronic quantum instability. You know, we know

429
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:34,200
that she became an assassin for Shield and tried to
steal the quantum tunnel from Hank Pym, and was

430
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:39,140
subsequently healed at the end of that movie by
Janet Van Dyne. But I don't think I learned

431
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:44,500
anything really new about Ghost in the
Thunderbolts movie. And I'm sure there are like

432
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:49,880
probably things from her past that she regrets,
but we never got to see any of that. We never got any

433
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:56,400
specifics on her regrets. I think it would have
been nice to have gotten a vision from the void with

434
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,020
her character. Or any of the other characters
besides Yelena and US Agent. Right. Really, Ghost

435
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:07,380
just seemed to hang around because she has a cool
power set. But I feel like the character of

436
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:12,300
Taskmaster probably would have been more
interesting to explore in terms of past regrets

437
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:18,060
and becoming a hero. I don't know. I'm still just
salty about Taskmaster at the end of the day. Let's

438
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:22,940
move on to the Contessa Valentina Allegra da
Fontaine, played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus. Julia

439
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:27,500
Louis-Dreyfus is a whole lot of fun to watch
because she's such an intelligent actor who can

440
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:32,040
deliver lines like they were all written by Aaron
Sorkin or something like that. I think that's her

441
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:37,280
special ability as an actress. Really, much of the
dialogue in this movie was written by Joanna

442
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:43,980
Collow, who wrote The Bear for FX. So that may have
something to do with how enjoyable Julia's

443
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:47,620
performance was. But I thought she was great. She
was actually more enjoyable in this role than I

444
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:52,840
thought she was going to be. I do wish that we got
more information on her motivations. Like we did

445
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:58,940
get a vision with her character where she was a
young child in Italy and her parents were freedom

446
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:03,640
fighters going up against the suppressive
regime. Or maybe it was a mob thing. It wasn't quite

447
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:09,720
clear because she's certainly not old enough to be
a child during like World War Two. But whatever

448
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:16,400
happened there didn't really serve to inform her
decisions in this movie, unless that is to say she

449
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,300
learned that fear and power can be valuable tools
in life. I'm not quite sure what to read off of that

450
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:25,980
memory that she had. But there's still a lot of
questions around her character, like is she

451
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:30,980
acting alone? We never really got to learn things
like that here. I kind of got the impression that

452
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:39,360
her character is all about having more power than
anyone else who can use it against her. Because

453
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:47,720
what she witnessed as a child left her feeling very
powerless. And she is threatened by other

454
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:52,340
countries like Wakanda, who may again be more
powerful than her and she doesn't want that.

455
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:57,540
That's a great way to read into it. Yeah, her
character is very, very similar to Amanda Waller,

456
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:05,180
who I think has a similar viewpoint in regards to
power and obtaining power and using power because

457
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:12,560
of her tragic backstory as well. I very much saw
Valentina as the analog of Amanda Waller in this

458
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:18,920
film. Yes, like she's Amanda Waller, but with an
actual personality. How dare you, sir? Biola

459
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:24,400
Davis would kick your ass for saying that. And I'll
have Julie Louis Dreyfus backing me up. She has way

460
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:31,000
more personality than Amanda Waller. Probably my
favorite moment in the film involves Valentina

461
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,300
when the century just kicked the asses of the
Thunderbolts characters and they're going down

462
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:43,100
in the elevator and she's like, and you're going to
do what I say. And he's like, why? And then she just

463
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:50,680
looks at him and she's like, what? I loved that
moment. It was just perfectly acted by Julie Louis

464
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:54,960
Dreyfus and Louis Pullman. I'll tell you about my
favorite moment when we get into the story

465
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:07,160

472
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:53,200
where we settle the debate and settle the score. In
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, mercenary Yelena Beloba

473
00:43:53,200 --> 00:44:00,100
destroys evidence of a lab belonging to the OXE or
Ox Corp. In Washington, D.C., CIA director

474
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:04,600
Valentina Allegra de Fontaine testifies in her
impeachment trial, where a congressional

475
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:09,420
subcommittee investigates her involvement in
Ox's potential illegal activity, including

476
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:14,660
human experimentation to create superhumans.
Defending her actions as necessary in a world

477
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:19,900
without Avengers, she orders her assistant
Melissa Gold to destroy all of Ox's evidence and

478
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:24,920
loose ends. After visiting her surrogate
paternal figure, Alexi, Yelena resolves to

479
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,820
better her life and come out of her depression by
becoming more of a hero like her late sister. She

480
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:35,100
accepts a mission from Valentina to stop a
corporate spy at a covert ox vault in Utah. I

481
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:39,600
thought the opening scene was really well done.
You know, a lot of the marketing of the film went

482
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:46,980
into Florence Pugh's actual practical stunt of
diving off of the Madurka 118 in Kuala Lumpur. It

483
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:51,300
was actually a pretty impressive stunt that I
thought did a great job with like its natural

484
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:56,220
lighting and everything like that, of really
setting the tone of the cinematography and the

485
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:00,140
practical action that we would be getting in the
course of the film. Yeah, I believe that's the

486
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:05,620
second tallest building in the world if I'm not
mistaken. Right, yeah. Arriving at the vault,

487
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:11,040
Yelena finds evidence of Project Sentry before
being attacked by US agent John Walker, who in turn

488
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:16,920
is attacked by Taskmaster, who is in turn attacked
by Ghost Yelena's target. After a fight in which

489
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:23,320
Ghost kills Taskmaster, the group meets Bob, who
stumbled out of an ox containment pod. Confused,

490
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:26,740
they determined that they've all worked for
Valentina and were sent to the vault to be

491
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:32,360
eliminated as loose ends. At a gala in Washington,
DC, New York congressman, Bucky, tries to

492
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:36,860
convince Valentina's assistant, Melissa, to
divulge incriminating information on her.

493
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:41,800
Despite the fact that Taskmaster went out dirty at
the end of that fight scene, I did think that was a

494
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:48,300
pretty damn cool fight scene that was kind of
reminiscent to how we describe and speculate the

495
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:53,480
battles within our dual episodes. You know, it was
like a lot of like causality. This leads to this

496
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:58,280
leads to this leads to this. I thought there was
just kind of like a great story kind of being told

497
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:03,400
through the action of their fight. It may be wonder
like what all their stats were and what it would

498
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,780
look like if I plugged them all into the simulator.
Yeah, it was a really cool fight. I don't think I've

499
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:13,220
mentioned this yet, but I really like Ghost's new
look in this film. They all looked really cool. I

500
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:17,740
don't know, but I really liked her look in M.N. and
the Wasp, too. Her white suit, that was pretty

501
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:22,840
badass. I do like her new helmet, though. Yeah,
yeah, that's really cool. Back in the vault, the

502
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:27,920
group escapes being incinerated. While making
contact with Bob, Yelena has a vision of a

503
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,060
childhood memory when she got another girl
killed. Valentina learns about the group's

504
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:37,800
survival in the vaults and plans to send a squad
after them, a plot that Alexi overhears as her limo

505
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,980
driver. Melissa reaches out to Bucky and lets him
know that Valentina is plotting something at the

506
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:50,800
ox vault. Which, holy cow, how irresponsible of
Valentina to just riff in the back of a limo and let

507
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:55,840
the limo driver hear what she's saying. Yeah, it
was a little convenient, especially having Alexi

508
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:01,160
turn out to be the limo driver. But, I don't know, I
also thought it was kind of clever, story-wise.

509
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:06,520
Yeah, it was a nice way to get him involved. Yeah.
Back of the vault, the group, jokingly referred to

510
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:12,440
by Yelena as the Thunderbolts, her Peewee soccer
team, attempts to climb an elevator shaft. At the

511
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:18,340
top, Walker has a memory of his family leaving him,
a vision also induced by contact with Bob. They

512
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:22,680
fight some of Valentina's forces, taking their
gear as a disguise and attempt to steal a truck to

513
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:28,180
escape. When stopped at a checkpoint, Bob creates
a diversion by drawing enemy fire and is revealed

514
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:34,060
to be invulnerable. Thunderbolts escape as Bob
attempts to fly, but he crash lands and is

515
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:40,700
captured. The elevator shaft scene was
horrifying in some aspects. Oh yeah, absolutely.

516
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:47,500
Like, not only did it trigger claustrophobia in
me, but also it made me really not want to skip leg

517
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:53,040
day the next day I ever do leg day, because that
would have sucked. Yeah, that would have been

518
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:58,300
really hard. It was funny how it seems to work and
then they got to the top and they were like, well,

519
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:02,780
what happens now? And I was like, oh yeah, what does
happen now? It was an interesting ethical

520
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:07,360
experiment because there was no way that they all
would be able to survive, despite the fact that

521
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:12,800
they all needed each other to even get to the top of
the shaft. Right. The way they pulled it off,

522
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,380
though, I thought was pretty neat. And by pull it
off, I mean, survive US agents general

523
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:23,260
douchebaggery. It did make me wonder why, though,
if Yelena had a grappling hook, launcher,

524
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:29,520
mantetour, wrist, which she used to save Bob, she
could have easily used that to get to the top of the

525
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:35,260
elevator shaft, or at least, you know, get all of
them through the shaft safely. That's true. Yeah,

526
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:40,600
she definitely could have used it as a means to get
them all up. And really, Bob wouldn't have died

527
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:44,680
from that fall either. He would have found out that
he was invulnerable and then probably learned how

528
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:49,520
to fly from there. But I thought it was an exciting
moment nonetheless. Yeah, definitely. As the

529
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:54,600
Thunderbolts escape into the desert, they are
rescued by a lexie in his limo and are pursued by an

530
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:59,660
ox military convoy. They're saved by Bucky on his
motorcycle, who captures the team in order to

531
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:04,520
bring them in as evidence against Valentina. In
New York, Bob is brought to the former Avengers

532
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:10,620
Tower, renamed by Valentina as the Watchtower.
She manipulates him into becoming a hero under her

533
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:15,220
control known as the Sentry. Holding the
Thunderbolts in a garage, Bucky learns from

534
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:21,180
Melissa and corroborates with the team that Bob's
power and instability will threaten New York.

535
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:25,160
Now, this brings me to my favorite moment in the
movie, which I think was the funniest moment,

536
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:32,160
which was the Molotov cocktail, where you have
this thrilling chase and a lexie is yelling for the

537
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:37,020
vodka and they give it to him and he like takes a
swig. You're not sure where he's going with this.

538
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:41,780
You think maybe he's just getting drunk, but he
creates a Molotov cocktail out of it, lights it on

539
00:49:41,780 --> 00:49:48,200
fire like a badass. He tosses it out of the window
and it bullseyes the convoy exactly as he intended

540
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:55,280
to little to no effect, which was the joke. But it
was a good throw, right? It was a great throw. Just

541
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:01,340
the subversion that I thought was so hilarious. I
really liked how the redesign of the Avengers

542
00:50:01,340 --> 00:50:08,740
Tower by Valentina was making it look more like the
Sentry Watch Tower in the comic books, where I had

543
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:13,740
those like black curved elements coming out the
side of it. I thought that was a really clever way to

544
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:18,700
incorporate the Sentry's headquarters into that
building, because in the comic books, he had

545
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:23,260
established his headquarters on top of Stark
Tower when he was a member of the New Avengers.

546
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:28,100
That's right. Yeah, totally forgot about that. He
was a member of that team. The Thunderbolts crash

547
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:33,120
their van into the Watch Tower where they're
invited to the penthouse to meet Bob as the Sentry.

548
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:37,920
Valentina reveals her plan for the Thunderbolts
to be discredited as rogue criminals in the media

549
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,940
when they try to stop the Sentry, now branded as
Earth's mightiest hero. The team tries to defeat

550
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:48,440
Bob anyway and are easily defeated and forced to
retreat. Bob's instability has him turn on

551
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:54,440
Valentina and he transforms into the Void. As most
of the Thunderbolts give up after their defeat,

552
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:59,380
they witness the Void begin terrorizing
Manhattan. One by one, they begin doing what they

553
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:05,780
can to save who they can. It was pretty telling to me
how in the fantastic scene where the Thunderbolts

554
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:11,640
characters meet with Valentina at the penthouse,
and she just begins insulting each and every one of

555
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:18,480
them, except for Ghost, who she's just like, oh
yeah, Ghost. Oh, and Yelena, you look terrible.

556
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:24,480
The fact that she didn't insult Ghost like the
others just kind of proved the point that Ghost

557
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:30,120
really wasn't a big enough character in the movie
to insult. Yeah, she was kind of a little bit more

558
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:35,160
pointless in that regard. I bet you that Valentina
would have had some stuff to say about Taskmaster.

559
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:40,120
I don't know. I liked the fight against the Sentry.
Again, I do wish there was less telekinesis, but it

560
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:44,800
was cool to see them, you know, give their all
against this all powerful being. What can you do at

561
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:50,760
that point but retreat? And Alexi's pep talk to
Yelena, where she's telling him that all she sees

562
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:55,280
in herself are these flaws and she's such a
horrible person. But he refers to this instance in

563
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:01,980
her life where she chose to be the goalie of her
Thunderbolts Pee Wee team, not because she was

564
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:07,280
lazy and didn't want to run like she thought, but
because she said she wanted to be the one people

565
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:14,440
could count on if they made a mistake. It was such a
touching heartfelt moment to just build her up in

566
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:20,360
that way and tell her that she's better than she
thinks she is, you know. I was kind of confused how

567
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:27,800
the void took over the Sentry character when the
Sentry was dead. But I also thought that the void

568
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:34,080
was a very effective villain, like very scary,
especially with the display of his powers, how he

569
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:39,820
just essentially turned everyone into these
shadows. And the fact that it affected like

570
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:44,540
everyone in New York City was even more
terrifying. Yeah, when he first used it against

571
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:49,620
that little girl that Alexi had saved, you know,
like she smiled at the Red Guardian and then all of a

572
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:53,500
sudden she just disappeared. Like all of his
actions were for naught in that very heroic

573
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:59,100
moment. And there was just something really
disheartening about that that made the void such a

574
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:03,660
compelling villain. As the void's darkness
spreads, Yelena steps into it and finds herself

575
00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:08,260
back in her previous vision. She breaks through to
other difficult times in her life, such as the

576
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:13,160
Black Widow training program and her time as an
alcoholic. She ends up finding Bob in his own

577
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:17,660
memory in his childhood attic. The rest of the
Thunderbolts end up finding them by entering the

578
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:23,280
void as well. Together they fight off Bob's abuse
of stepfather, a sign twirling chicken high on

579
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:29,180
meth, and the void himself at the Ox Lab where Bob
underwent the Sentry project. Bob tries to

580
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:34,140
overpower the void through violence, but the team
learns the only way to overcome the void is through

581
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:40,180
healing Bob's trauma and showing him he's not
alone. The chicken twirling moment was so damn

582
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:47,340
good. I was cracking up in the theater. Srishten,
he was like, I was high at the time. Just knowing

583
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:52,460
that something like that happened is funny.
Seeing the Thunderbolts fight a high sign

584
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:58,020
twirling chicken was not on my bingo card for this
year. No, it's definitely the biggest surprise of

585
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:03,520
the movie, I would say. It was a great gag, though.
As silly as it was, it didn't overstay its welcome,

586
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,920
thankfully. They didn't have a whole scene of them
fighting the chicken. They were in and out, but it

587
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:14,680
worked so well because of that. Going back to
Yelena's trauma about having her friend killed,

588
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:21,380
man, I really have to wonder what this 12-year-old
girl did to deserve an assassination from the Red

589
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:26,780
Room. I think the Red Room was in the practice of
weeding out the girls that didn't perform to their

590
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:32,560
expectations. Oh, you thought that girl was a
member of the Red Room as well. OK, well, that makes

591
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:38,900
sense. Yeah, real dark shit. Real dark shit. Super
dark. It was also really dark seeing Yelena Bolova

592
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:43,520
on the bathroom floor with all the bottles around
her. There wasn't really much to that

593
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:47,700
performance, but it was still very powerful.
Seeing Florence Pugh like that. Back on the

594
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:52,320
streets of Manhattan, the city returns to normal
as the void disappears. The Thunderbolts see

595
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:56,740
Valentina and try to apprehend her, only to
stumble onto a press briefing she arranged,

596
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:02,300
announcing the team as the new Avengers. Yelena
warns her that they own her now. In a mid-credits

597
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:07,580
scene, Red Guardian tries to get a grocery store
patron to notice him on a weedy cereal box. After

598
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:12,220
the end credits, the new Avengers debate how to
address Sam Wilson's Avengers team, and they

599
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:17,920
notice a distress signal from outer space coming
from a ship bearing the Fantastic Four emblem. I am

600
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:24,000
curious what you thought about the sort of end
reckoning with Valentina or the lack thereof, I

601
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:30,680
should say. So the lack of closure with Valentina
wasn't surprising to me. And I'm not sure what it

602
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:34,940
would have looked like if she did get her
comeuppance. Obviously, she would be impeached.

603
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:40,000
She would probably go to jail. But even then, at
least like in the comic books, we still wouldn't

604
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:45,700
have seen the end of her. It kind of felt like the
Thunderbolts traded justice for fame. They kind

605
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:52,920
of traded justice for an opportunity, I think, to
be the people they wanted to be. I think they found a

606
00:55:52,920 --> 00:56:00,780
way to manipulate the situation and really give
Valentina her comeuppance by being in control of

607
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:05,140
her as opposed to the other way around. Did you
think that that was like in character for someone

608
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:11,580
like Bucky, though? Sure. I think so. Yeah, I mean,
he's been an anti-hero before. I think in this

609
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:16,520
regard, they would all see that the ends justify
the means. And I think he sees the benefit a new

610
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:21,980
Avengers team would have, especially using
Valentina's resources. I think he sees that as the

611
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:27,980
greater good. Again, I don't think this is an
absence of justice so much as a kind of twisting of

612
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:32,880
it to suit their needs. I didn't love the ending,
I'll be honest, because it did feel like justice

613
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:40,160
was not met and it did feel very shallow on behalf of
the team members. It's one of the few things I

614
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:45,000
really didn't like about the film. I kind of liked
the subversion of the ending, actually. It was

615
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,540
anti-heroes being anti-heroes. But that's the
film overall. I think the film stands out as a

616
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:56,040
unique entry from Marvel. And I think because of
that, it'll be appreciated more by fans and

617
00:56:56,040 --> 00:57:01,320
general audiences who I don't think necessarily
are tired of Marvel. They're just looking for

618
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:07,600
something new and different. And I think that
prioritizing introspection over exposition,

619
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:11,840
The Thunderbolts film uniquely delivers one of
the more mature and thoughtful experiences in

620
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:18,080
Marvel's film catalog. I am giving it four and a
half out of five stars, a fresh rating on Rotten

621
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:24,940
Tomatoes. Which is a really high rating. It's only
half a star away from a perfect rating. But I would

622
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:31,980
actually agree with it. Now, this is the same
rating we gave Watchmen and the Suicide Squad.

623
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:37,220
Well, I still think those are better films than
this. I also can't see giving this a lower rating

624
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:43,600
because it was just so well executed. It's much
more simple than those films. And I think in part

625
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:49,520
that's why it feels a little bit more pure in terms
of like a character study that they were going for.

626
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:55,900
I thought they nailed the execution of this film.
Yeah, it's nice for Marvel to have a movie like

627
00:57:55,900 --> 00:58:00,680
this, I think, in their filmography. Oh,
absolutely. For sure. But that does it for this

628
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:37,280
review. AJ9K helped close us out. Our next episode
is going to be a dual episode where we find out who

629
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:44,240
would win in a fight between the DC hero Ray and the
Marvel mutant character Havoc. Yeah, two of the

630
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:49,060
coolest and more interesting looking characters
in either universe. Definitely looking forward

631
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:53,060
to this matchup. But that does it for this episode.
We want to give a big thanks to our executive

632
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:57,720

636
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:21,860
podcast possible. We'll talk to you guys next week
up, up and away. True believers. Honestly, I just

637
00:59:21,860 --> 
thought the asterisk was going to be a symbol for a
butthole.
