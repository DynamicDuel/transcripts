00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,963
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:30,120
dynamic duel podcast weekly show where we review
superhero films and debate the superiority

3
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,442
between marvel and dc by comparing their characters
in stat-based battle simulations i'm johnny

4
00:00:35,462 --> 00:00:41,645
dc and i'm his twin brother marvelous joe and
in this episode we are doing a duel between

5
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:47,927
the outsider character halo and marvel's power
pack and i know what you guys may be thinking

6
00:00:47,987 --> 00:00:52,929
like did these guys jump the shark these characters
are not very well known even among dc and marvel

7
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:57,789
fans To which we gotta say, yes this episode
is very relevant because Halo is a member of

8
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:02,593
the Outsiders. And we're gonna do a team duel
with the Outsiders in a few months against

9
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:07,297
X-Force. So we gotta get through this power
pack. While they haven't had the biggest presence

10
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:12,302
in Marvel over the years, they have had some
amazing stories. And you guys should definitely

11
00:01:12,462 --> 00:01:16,425
stick around to listen to those as we break
down the characters backstories, enter their

12
00:01:16,445 --> 00:01:20,769
stats, and run simulations to see who'd win
in a fight. I mean you say we gotta get through

13
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:24,940
this! Like, these characters are interesting.
I actually think the characters are very interesting.

14
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,302
That's what I'm saying. I feel like maybe because
they're not popular, they may not seem interesting,

15
00:01:29,362 --> 00:01:34,125
but actually I was incredibly fascinated by
the stories of the Power Pack as I was going

16
00:01:34,145 --> 00:01:38,347
through their backstory. Same. Yeah, I can't
wait to go over Halo's backstory. But before

17
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:41,749
that, we're going to break down the comic book
movie news from the past week, of which there

18
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:47,793
was just one major news item, and that was the
teaser trailer number two for the Mac series,

19
00:01:47,953 --> 00:01:52,047
The Penguin. As always, we list our segment

Prize! A No Prize is an award Marvel used to

43
00:03:54,082 --> 00:03:59,504
give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic duel
No Prize, is a digital award we post on Instagram

44
00:03:59,524 --> 00:04:04,165
for the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week we asked

45
00:04:04,185 --> 00:04:08,795
you guys... Who do you want to direct the Marvel
Studios Blade movie and why? And that's coming

46
00:04:08,835 --> 00:04:13,117
off the news that Yann Dimanche, the director
that was most recently associated with the

47
00:04:13,157 --> 00:04:18,979
film, had left the project. We got some solid
answers here. Uh, I totally fucked up. This

48
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:23,941
is the first time we've ever done this in this
podcast's eight-year history. I accidentally

49
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:29,083
deleted one of the voicemails that was sent
in by a listener. I am truly sorry if we don't

50
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:33,585
get to your voicemail within this segment. Don't
let it deter you from sending voicemails in

51
00:04:33,605 --> 00:04:38,283
the future. but whoever left it didn't leave
their name on the form. So we weren't able

52
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:42,964
to reach out to them. I just want everyone to
know that fuck up was Joseph's to own. I had

53
00:04:43,084 --> 00:04:51,626
no part of it. And I am embarrassed for him
and by him. And you can be assured that there

54
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:55,908
will be a punishment for this. That's fair,
that's fair. But we have three honorable mentions

55
00:04:55,948 --> 00:05:01,589
to get through as well as a no prize winner.
Our first honorable mention goes to Matt Allen,

56
00:05:01,929 --> 00:05:06,094
who said. Hey guys, this is Matt from Texas.
The director I think that would be best for

57
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:11,596
the Blade movie should be Sam Raimi. He can
do the horror genre, he can do a little bit

58
00:05:11,636 --> 00:05:18,518
of comedy. I mean, shoot, we saw it in the Multiverse
of Madness, the Spider-Man trilogy, the original

59
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:24,499
trilogy of Spider-Man anyways. And I just think
he would be the best one for it to be able

60
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:32,201
to get that level of fear and humor in there.
Now I'll be honest, I wasn't the biggest fan

61
00:05:32,622 --> 00:05:37,886
of Doctor Strange 2, but that had nothing to
do with the direction. I think Sam Raimi is

62
00:05:37,926 --> 00:05:44,250
a fantastic director, as evidenced by his Spider-Man
films and other genre work. We know that he

63
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:49,414
could work within the Marvel studio system,
and that's huge. I think he would be fantastic

64
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:53,777
for the Blade movie. I mean, if you look at
his evil dead work in addition, you know that

65
00:05:53,817 --> 00:05:59,021
he also has, obviously, an affinity for horror.
And I think, you know, Blade is more overtly...

66
00:05:59,674 --> 00:06:04,219
Horror comic series as opposed to something
like Doctor Strange, which can have some horror

67
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:09,545
elements in it But it's mostly about magic and
mysticism, right? Yeah, but like even with

68
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:14,751
Doctor Strange to like I would say that's the
most Horr-esque film that the MCU has put out

69
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:18,996
to date other than werewolf by night, which
is not a film But you know, it was a special

70
00:06:19,036 --> 00:06:23,959
presentation on Disney Plus I guess the reason
why Sam Raimi didn't get the no prize win here

71
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:29,422
is because of how Matt Allen described the comedy
leanings of the director. And yes, Sam Raimi

72
00:06:29,462 --> 00:06:33,844
has injected some overt comedy into his films
like look at Evil Dead 2 and stuff like that.

73
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:39,206
I'm not necessarily sure that Blade needs that.
I think Blade should be a mostly grounded affair

74
00:06:39,246 --> 00:06:43,428
just the way I would like to see it. I think
it should take itself very seriously and be

75
00:06:43,468 --> 00:06:48,962
not too whimsical, you know? Or tongue in cheek.
Although to be fair... That is Marvel's brand.

76
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:53,423
When they tried to deviate from that, we got
the Eternals. That's true, but I didn't mind

77
00:06:53,443 --> 00:06:57,304
the Eternals. I don't mind Marvel deviating
from their brand in order to keep things from

78
00:06:57,524 --> 00:07:01,546
feeling too stale. I like the idea of Marvel
mixing things up, kind of like how they did

79
00:07:01,566 --> 00:07:06,647
with Werewolf by Night. OK, got you. But great
answer, Matt Allen. Fantastic. Our next honorable

80
00:07:06,707 --> 00:07:12,629
mention goes to John Storosky. Who said? What's
going on? It's John Storosky. My first choice

81
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:17,855
would be Quentin Tarantino to direct. new Blade
movie, however, because that is obviously never

82
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:24,079
going to happen, I'm going to go with Peter
Jackson. He has the directing chops to make

83
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:29,322
a cinematic masterpiece, and on top of that,
he's got the swordsplay with the Lord of the

84
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:34,405
Rings. He's got all the action. I think he would
be a perfect director for the Blade film, so

85
00:07:34,445 --> 00:07:41,128
let's get Peter Jackson in there. Yeah, Peter
Jackson, you know, he is one of the greatest

86
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:45,291
directors of all time, having directed one of
the greatest franchises, the Lord of the Rings

87
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:50,254
movies that were for the most part expected
to be unfilmable just because of the dense

88
00:07:50,294 --> 00:07:54,557
nature of those stories. But he did it. You
know, as far as I'm concerned, Peter Jackson

89
00:07:54,577 --> 00:07:59,341
can do anything. My big question with him though
is would he want to direct a Blade movie? Well,

90
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:04,484
maybe. I mean, he does have a background in
the horror genre and he's never done vampires

91
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:08,740
before. I have to imagine. There might be a
little bit of interest there, at least I would

92
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,905
hope there would be, because Peter Jackson is
a master of world building. And one of my biggest

93
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:20,771
fears about this Blade movie is introducing
vampires into the MCU I think can get a little

94
00:08:20,912 --> 00:08:25,336
sticky. But if you have a director as talented
as Peter Jackson behind the wheel on that,

95
00:08:25,656 --> 00:08:30,120
I think there's no way you could go wrong. Would
he ever do it? I doubt it, but that would be

96
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,992
amazing. Yeah. Sometimes I wonder why Peter
Jackson hasn't gotten more work ever since

97
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:38,615
the Lord of the Rings movies and the Hobbit
movies that he's directed. And sometimes I

98
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:43,599
wonder if it's because he did such a good job
at making those movies that most studios just

99
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:47,463
can't afford to hire him. They're like, oh yeah,
we'd love to have Peter Jackson on this project.

100
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:51,446
And he'd be like, fuck you, give me $10 billion.
And they'd be like, no way. And he'd be like,

101
00:08:51,746 --> 00:08:55,970
I directed Lord of the Rings. Come on. You know,
you're like, bitch, I didn't need to do your

102
00:08:56,010 --> 00:09:02,602
movie anyway. Did you ever see Dead Alive by
Peter Jackson? No, I saw the Frighteners though.

103
00:09:02,702 --> 00:09:06,083
I love the Frighteners. Yeah, that was a good
one. That was a good one Great answer john

104
00:09:06,103 --> 00:09:11,824
starosky our next honorable mention goes to
travis herndon who said what's up dynamic dudes

105
00:09:11,864 --> 00:09:20,647
travis here Shout out to my twin. So my picks
would have to be I think those two would be

106
00:09:20,707 --> 00:09:26,889
pretty good to direct blade I mean they doing
a new bad boys movie and judging from the trailer

107
00:09:26,929 --> 00:09:32,155
and everything It looks fucking insane and it
easily can fit that sort of blade action scene,

108
00:09:32,175 --> 00:09:36,919
especially they're trying to go like a Wesley
Snipes style action. So yeah, those are my

109
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:43,144
pick for Blade. I'll be honest, I have not seen
any of the movies that Bilal Fallah and Adil

110
00:09:43,164 --> 00:09:48,528
Al-Arbi have directed, but that doesn't stop
them from being involved in interesting projects,

111
00:09:48,608 --> 00:09:52,952
including the recent backroll movie that was
unfortunately canned. They directed some of

112
00:09:52,972 --> 00:09:57,095
the episodes of Ms. Marvel, which was a fantastic
television show, and they're even rumored to

113
00:09:57,136 --> 00:10:01,894
be in the running for the upcoming Spider-Man
movie. Yeah, honestly, out of all of the choices

114
00:10:01,974 --> 00:10:06,155
we have here, including the no prize winner
that we'll get to, I think this is the most

115
00:10:06,395 --> 00:10:11,617
plausible answer. Not only do I think that they
would be psyched to do a blade film, they would

116
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:16,738
also be able to match the tone that I think
a lot of us are looking for in that movie.

117
00:10:16,778 --> 00:10:20,199
For sure. Yeah. All these honorable mentions
are actually great answers. We want to give

118
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:25,600
a big shout out to Cyrus Moore and to whoever's
answer I deleted. I'm still sorry about that.

119
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:32,454
But the winner of this week's no prize is Brandon
Estegard. Who said? I think that Taika Waititi

120
00:10:33,214 --> 00:10:38,056
should be the only director who isn't allowed
to make this movie. Instead they should get

121
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:42,717
Fede Alvarez because he has a great background
in horror, including the Evil Dead 2013 movie

122
00:10:43,137 --> 00:10:47,238
Alien Romulus, and he's even directed a couple
episodes of From Dust Till Dawn, which was

123
00:10:47,258 --> 00:10:52,040
a vampire series. And I just personally think
he's the best choice for anything horror at

124
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:57,541
the moment. Yeah, Fede Alvarez has really made
a name for himself ever since his Evil Dead

125
00:10:57,581 --> 00:11:02,155
remake back in 2018. 13 I want to say, but he
also directed Don't Breathe, which I thought

126
00:11:02,175 --> 00:11:07,777
was a fantastic movie, and Alien Romulus coming
out soon looks really, really good. So yeah,

127
00:11:08,018 --> 00:11:11,999
I think he's probably one of the best names
in the horror genre right now. He's just doing

128
00:11:12,179 --> 00:11:16,581
really interesting things behind the camera
and I think he's kind of an auteur and I would

129
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:20,543
love to have him behind the Blade movie. I also
think it's attainable. I don't know if it's

130
00:11:20,563 --> 00:11:26,766
attainable. I think he might be a little too
over the top for Marvel's brand. Not saying

131
00:11:26,806 --> 00:11:33,169
that he couldn't adjust his tastes to fit the
Marvel brand. I just think that's less likely

132
00:11:33,289 --> 00:11:37,692
than, you know, some of the other directors
that we've talked about. That said, I love

133
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:43,335
Fede Alvarez for this choice, because the Blade
movie I personally want to see would be the

134
00:11:43,355 --> 00:11:48,758
kind of Blade movie that Fede Alvarez would
direct. Absolutely. That would just make my

135
00:11:48,778 --> 00:11:53,380
whole year if I heard the news that he got the
job. If they announced that he was the director,

136
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:57,010
like that would make me do a double take. I
would feel threatened. that because I'd be

137
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:02,537
like holy shit that's like too amazing. Congrats
to Brandon Estergaard for winning this week's

138
00:12:02,577 --> 00:12:06,842
no prize if you the listener want a shot at
winning your own no prize. Stay tuned to later

00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:11,367
on in this episode when we'll be asking another
question of the week. And now that that's done,

140
00:12:12,088 --> 00:12:12,849
on to the news!

141
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:23,493
Okay, so this past week we got our second official
teaser for the Penguin series. I don't know

142
00:12:23,513 --> 00:12:27,115
why they're calling it a teaser. It's over two
minutes long. It's a trailer. It's our first

143
00:12:27,255 --> 00:12:34,579
big trailer for the series and it is so damn
good. It perfectly matches the vibe of the

144
00:12:34,599 --> 00:12:41,423
Batman film, which again still reminds me of
that David Fincher-esque noir kind of vibe.

145
00:12:41,543 --> 00:12:46,982
But also, and I thought of this as I was watching
this trailer specifically, of Batman Year One.

146
00:12:47,162 --> 00:12:52,324
It's the world of mobsters and corruption that
I've always wanted to see Batman in and it

147
00:12:52,344 --> 00:12:57,825
looks like the penguin is going to nail that
tone to a T. The trailer was so good I completely

148
00:12:57,865 --> 00:13:03,047
forgot about my fat mobster joke from the previous
teaser. Oh gosh. So I'm not even going to bring

149
00:13:03,087 --> 00:13:07,688
it up. The fact that I called him fat mobstered
before. Do you still think that the suit looks

150
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:11,989
really fake? Not in any of the shots in this
trailer, no. I think they did a good job of

151
00:13:12,269 --> 00:13:15,899
hiding the fat suit here. Good, they probably
did that just for you, so they didn't have

152
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:21,565
to hear your shit. No, but I'm glad to hear
that you liked it. Right off the bat, I got

153
00:13:21,605 --> 00:13:26,790
super excited because it starts off with footage
from the end of the Batman when Gotham City

154
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:33,576
gets flooded. It looks like this show actually
takes place one week after the Batman film

155
00:13:33,737 --> 00:13:40,006
ends. And in a way it's kind of setting up like
this almost no man's land kind of. esque story

156
00:13:40,366 --> 00:13:45,189
in that Gotham city is in shambles and there's
a power vacuum and the penguin is going to

157
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:50,872
try and take advantage of that while the city
is in chaos. Which is a phenomenal premise,

158
00:13:50,952 --> 00:13:57,395
I love that. Early on we get to see the penguin
speaking with Salvatore Moroni in jail explaining

159
00:13:57,435 --> 00:14:01,298
how he basically wants to take over Gotham's
criminal underworld but it looks like he's

160
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:07,001
going to be facing competition from Carmine
Falcone's children, specifically Alberto and

161
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:13,184
Sophia, which If you know anything about like
the Long Halloween and Jeff Loeb's takes on

162
00:14:13,224 --> 00:14:17,767
those characters specifically, I think we're
in for a real treat with this show and it just

163
00:14:17,787 --> 00:14:22,890
gets me so pumped to see it. Yeah, it looks
like something out of, you know, The Sopranos

164
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:27,092
or something directed by Francis Ford Coppola.
It looks really fucking good. I thought it

165
00:14:27,112 --> 00:14:33,216
was weird to see the guy who played Alex Wilder
in the Runaways television series as the Penguin's

166
00:14:33,236 --> 00:14:36,718
like right-hand man. I don't know what character
he's playing in the show. Yeah, I guess the

167
00:14:36,738 --> 00:14:41,280
character's name is Victor Aguilar. I think
he's his driver. But I was actually excited

168
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,143
to see how many explosions and machine guns
there were in the show as well. It kind of

169
00:14:46,163 --> 00:14:51,626
gives that elevated, fantastical, kind of Gotham
City atmosphere that could go a little bit

170
00:14:51,866 --> 00:14:57,069
more extra than something like the Sopranos.
I mean, the world of Sopranos, they don't have

171
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:01,812
overt supervillains like they do here. They
don't have some guy in an asylum whose face

172
00:15:01,832 --> 00:15:10,728
is all scarred up like the Joker's. Or a guy
named The Riddler going, No, no, no. Yeah,

173
00:15:10,968 --> 00:15:14,990
I'm wondering if those characters are going
to show up in this show because apparently

174
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:20,492
Sophia Falcone was in Arkham Asylum for a time.
So I don't know. Maybe we'll actually get to

175
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:25,054
see the asylum or a little bit more of it. Speaking
of that, is it weird to have a Batman show

176
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:30,037
without the Batman in it? Like you'd have to
think that all the chaos that the penguin is

177
00:15:30,057 --> 00:15:34,540
going to be causing among the crime families.
that at some point you'd have the Dark Knight

178
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:39,885
show up to shut things down. So this is just
a rumor, but apparently Robert Pattinson does

179
00:15:39,925 --> 00:15:44,789
make a cameo in the series. Oh, well, yeah,
it's pretty cool. Well, now I'm going to be

180
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:51,075
expecting that and I will be severely let down
if that does not happen, dude. Same. So this

181
00:15:51,115 --> 00:15:52,657
brings us to our question of the week.

182
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:03,633
Besides Batman, what character do you most hope
to see in the Penguin Max series, and why?

before June 29th.

188
00:16:34,658 --> 00:16:38,463
That does it for all the news for this episode.
Now let's move on to the main event, where

189
00:16:38,503 --> 00:16:44,812
we find out who will win in a match up between
the Outsiders character of Halo and Marvel's

190
00:16:44,992 --> 00:16:45,653
Power Pack.

191
00:17:01,742 --> 00:17:06,545
Alright, Halo vs Power Pack. Of course, as we
mentioned earlier, this episode is in lead

192
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:13,471
up to our next team duel, which will be the
Outsiders vs X-Force, and Halo is a founding

193
00:17:13,531 --> 00:17:19,095
member of the Outsiders team. So we knew we
needed to get her into a duel episode sooner

194
00:17:19,136 --> 00:17:24,820
rather than later. Now, years ago, I think,
maybe it was just one year ago, one of our

195
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:30,605
executive producers, Miggy Meth and Gian, suggested
Halo vs Power Pack, and this was recently brought

196
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:36,280
up again. by Devin Davis who pitched the same
idea and that's what we ended up going with.

197
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,403
Primarily because all of these characters are
insanely versatile. Yeah, that was the big

198
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:45,586
thing. There were several options available
for us to pit against Halo, including Dazzler

199
00:17:45,646 --> 00:17:50,489
or Jubilee or something like that, but the versatility
of Halo is the thing that gets me. She has

200
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:54,531
like a lot of different powers within her power
set. And that's basically her whole thing.

201
00:17:54,551 --> 00:17:57,473
You know, she changes the color of the light
that she produces and all of a sudden she has

202
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,787
an entirely different... power set. And so I
knew that I needed someone that was a little

203
00:18:00,807 --> 00:18:05,331
bit more versatile than someone like Jubilee
who just shoots fireworks or someone like Dazzler

204
00:18:05,371 --> 00:18:09,755
who can convert sound to light, which is powerful,
but not in the way that I needed to be. I need

205
00:18:09,775 --> 00:18:15,400
to be adaptable. I need to be versatile. And
I think the Power Pack kids are just that.

206
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,163
You know, they got a cool set of powers amongst
themselves. There have been plenty of times

207
00:18:19,323 --> 00:18:22,866
within their stories that they've actually swapped
powers and stuff like that. But there was also

208
00:18:22,886 --> 00:18:28,810
a time when Alex, the oldest of the Power Pack
kids acquired all their powers. And so we knew

209
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:34,992
that was our in for how to approach this match.
It's essentially going to be Halo versus power

210
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:39,473
house, which is what Alex power called himself
when he had all of his family's powers. Oh,

211
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:44,094
interesting. I didn't know that. Another reason
I like this matchup is because aesthetically,

212
00:18:44,395 --> 00:18:48,716
they share a lot of similarities. Like they
wear these black costumes with like strands

213
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:54,117
of color. I thought it just fit. The power packs
seem cool to me, even though they're like snot

214
00:18:54,137 --> 00:18:59,469
nose kids. But from what I know of their powers,
they're kind of like the Fantastic Four upgraded,

215
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:04,754
in my opinion. Really? Interesting. Okay. I
don't disagree. I think their power set is

216
00:19:04,774 --> 00:19:08,177
a little bit cooler, but you know, we'll get
into that in the character breakdown. Before

217
00:19:08,217 --> 00:19:12,782
that, to explain the methodology behind our
duels, let's go to our sentient duel simulator,

218
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:18,767
Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K, tell our listeners
how you go about determining a winner in our

219
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:24,058
duel matchups. Yes, of course, sir. The way
I determine a winner between the contestants

220
00:19:24,098 --> 00:19:30,140
is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations using
the characters statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation

221
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:35,901
is a probabilistic model used to determine outcomes
through random sampling. In this case, I randomise

222
00:19:35,921 --> 00:19:40,363
the statistics along a normal distribution as
a way to simulate the many variables that can

223
00:19:40,403 --> 00:19:45,264
occur during battle. The stat parameters are
based on the official Marvel power grid from

224
00:19:45,304 --> 00:19:47,925
which the DC characters statistics are extrapolated.

225
00:19:51,382 --> 00:19:56,504
damage potential, versatility and perception
in order to create a more detailed and accurate

226
00:19:56,545 --> 00:20:01,928
simulation. The results of the 1000 simulations
provide a percentage of wins for each character.

227
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:06,302
The contestant with the higher percentage is
declared the victor. as they have a higher

228
00:20:06,342 --> 00:20:11,566
probability to win any given battle. In an equitable
pairing, neither character should win 100%

229
00:20:12,187 --> 00:20:16,350
of the matches. The comic book stories have
shown that there's even a way for Batman to

230
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:20,893
defeat Superman, so the confidence rate of my
method falls in line with the precedents that

231
00:20:20,913 --> 00:20:25,837
have been established in the source material.
My mathematical simulations are without subjectivity

232
00:20:25,897 --> 00:20:31,241
or bias. Feats are not the sole consideration,
nor are fan votes tabulated for determination

233
00:20:31,281 --> 00:20:36,263
of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K! Before we run the
simulations though, we'd like to break down

234
00:20:36,343 --> 00:20:40,685
each character's histories and abilities before
improvising a scenario on how we imagine one

235
00:20:40,725 --> 00:20:45,547
of the 1000 simulations would play out beat
for beat. And I believe it is my turn to go

236
00:20:45,587 --> 00:20:49,549
first with the Marvel characters backstory,
so let me go ahead and tell you all about Power

237
00:20:49,589 --> 00:20:56,852
Pack. A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far
away, existed a planet known as Chimelia, where

238
00:20:56,872 --> 00:21:02,923
an advanced race of beings, Chimelians, developed
a means of energy production via a process

239
00:21:02,943 --> 00:21:08,066
that converted matter into antimatter. Though
their technological pursuits were well-meaning,

240
00:21:08,306 --> 00:21:13,729
their antimatter converter resulted in a cataclysmic
chain of energy that completely destroyed their

241
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:18,712
home planet. Fortunately, some of the chameleons
were able to survive the disaster on a large

242
00:21:18,812 --> 00:21:24,375
space station that subsequently became their
new home. One of these chameleons, named Alefire

243
00:21:24,435 --> 00:21:30,154
Whitemane, had tapped into Earth's transmissions
in order to study humanity. and learned that

244
00:21:30,474 --> 00:21:36,377
one of Earth's scientists named Dr. James Power
had developed similar antimatter converter

245
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:42,141
technology in his pursuit of developing a source
of clean energy. Knowing that the device would

246
00:21:42,181 --> 00:21:47,543
destroy Earth if used, White Mane decided he
had to intervene. He sent a transmission to

247
00:21:47,563 --> 00:21:52,046
the Chimelians that he was leaving for Earth
in his starship. However, that transmission

248
00:21:52,066 --> 00:21:58,169
was intercepted by a war-mongering race of aliens
called the Snarks, who also decided to head

249
00:21:58,189 --> 00:22:04,714
to Earth. and steal the antimatter converter
for themselves. Meanwhile, on Earth lived Alex,

250
00:22:04,914 --> 00:22:10,719
Julie, Jack, and Katie, the four children of
Dr. James and Margaret Power. The night before

251
00:22:10,739 --> 00:22:15,862
the converter was to be tested, the youngest
child, Katie, looked into the night sky and

252
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:21,146
witnessed what appeared to be a meteor shower,
but was in reality an aerial battle between

253
00:22:21,226 --> 00:22:26,418
White Mane and the Snarks who managed to shoot
White Mane's spaceship down. When Katie told

254
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:30,882
her siblings of what she had seen in the sky,
the group went outside to find the crashed

255
00:22:30,902 --> 00:22:36,166
Chameleon starship. Shocked, they went to alert
their parents, but found them being abducted

256
00:22:36,307 --> 00:22:40,930
by the Snarks. The Snarks would have killed
the children, but they were saved by White

257
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:46,976
Mane, who was badly wounded, and the Snarks
escaped with the power of parents. Dying, the

258
00:22:47,076 --> 00:22:51,399
alien explained to the kids the situation, that
their father's device had the potential to

259
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:56,774
destroy the planet, and with his final breath,
he passed on his abilities to control gravity,

260
00:22:57,234 --> 00:23:03,736
acceleration, mass, and energy to Alex, Julie,
Jack, and Katie respectively. Deciding to rescue

261
00:23:03,756 --> 00:23:09,718
their parents, the four chose the superhero
names Zero-G, Lightspeed, Massmaster, and Energizer

262
00:23:10,118 --> 00:23:15,159
and called themselves the Power Pack. They destroyed
their father's antimatter converter, then used

263
00:23:15,219 --> 00:23:19,600
White Mean's Starship to rescue their parents
from the Snarks, whose interrogation methods

264
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:25,134
of Dr. James Power had accidentally destroyed
his memory of his device. The family moved

265
00:23:25,194 --> 00:23:29,996
to New York, where the Power Pack kids ran into
other heroes in their adventures against villains

266
00:23:30,016 --> 00:23:34,598
such as their father's former co-worker, who
donned a battle suit to become the Boogie Man,

267
00:23:35,219 --> 00:23:40,861
and Jackal, a high-ranking official in the Snark
World Empire. They met Spider-Man, Cloak and

268
00:23:40,881 --> 00:23:45,724
Dagger, and the Fantastic Four, the latter of
whom grew close with the Power Pack due to

269
00:23:45,764 --> 00:23:50,738
Mr. Fantastic and  Woman's son Franklin
being around the same age. In fact, at one

270
00:23:50,778 --> 00:23:56,601
point Franklin joined the Power Pack as a fifth
member named Tattletail. Later, the Power Kids

271
00:23:56,621 --> 00:24:00,944
were abducted and taken to Snark World where
their powers were taken from them. However,

272
00:24:01,004 --> 00:24:05,866
Franklin rescued them using White Manes old
starship. When their powers were returned,

273
00:24:06,347 --> 00:24:11,330
they were redistributed so that Alex now had
energy projection, Julie had mass control,

274
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:16,172
Jack had gravity manipulation, and Katie had
flight and speed. You can learn more about

275
00:24:16,252 --> 00:24:21,063
Franklin Richards and the Fantastic Four in
their duel against the Justice Society. The

276
00:24:21,103 --> 00:24:25,825
Power Pack frequently partnered with the X-Men,
fighting against Sabertooth and the Marauders,

277
00:24:26,225 --> 00:24:31,527
the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, the Master
Mold Sentinel, and the Goblin Queen, the latter

278
00:24:31,567 --> 00:24:36,949
fight teaming up with the New Mutants. Eventually,
Power Pack got the chance to visit the Chimeleon

279
00:24:37,029 --> 00:24:42,171
Space Station, where they saved the ancient
race from Queen Maraud of the Snarks, during

280
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:47,414
which time they reverted to their original power
sets. In the aftermath of that fight, The Power

281
00:24:47,454 --> 00:24:52,595
Pack helped the Chameleons finally move off
their space station onto a new, lush planet

282
00:24:52,635 --> 00:24:58,657
called Chameleon 3, where they decided to reject
excessive technology as a species. Back on

283
00:24:58,717 --> 00:25:04,679
Earth, Alex, driven by a desire to become a
more independent and impactful superhero, stole

284
00:25:04,699 --> 00:25:09,820
his siblings' abilities using Chameleon tech
and renamed himself Powerhouse, joining the

285
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:14,561
teenage superhero team called the New Warriors.
Though his actions angered his brother and

286
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:20,208
sisters, Alex rationalized his actions by claiming
that it was dangerous for children to be superheroes.

287
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:25,711
But eventually, he apologized and returned his
siblings' powers. The power pack briefly split

288
00:25:25,771 --> 00:25:31,694
up as Alex joined Mr. Fantastic's future foundation,
Think Tank of Scientific Minds. Julie pursued

289
00:25:31,734 --> 00:25:36,997
an acting career in Los Angeles where she encountered
the Runaways, and later joined the Future Foundation

290
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:42,881
alongside Alex. Jack opted to tend to their
sick mother, and Katie declined an invitation

291
00:25:42,921 --> 00:25:48,772
to join the Great They all later reunited as
the Power Pack, however, to team up with Moon

292
00:25:48,812 --> 00:25:53,454
Girl and Devil Dinosaur, whom you can learn
more about in their duel against Dorothy Spinner

293
00:25:53,614 --> 00:26:00,598
from Doom Patrol. That's their backstory. Powers-wise,
the four members of Power Pack, Zero G, Light

294
00:26:00,638 --> 00:26:06,121
Speed, Mask Master, and Energizer, have repeatedly
swapped abilities and code names throughout

295
00:26:06,161 --> 00:26:11,384
the years. For the purposes of simplifying the
simulations and our speculation, I'm going

296
00:26:11,404 --> 00:26:16,431
to treat the Power Pack as one person. Alex
power during his time as Powerhouse when he

297
00:26:16,471 --> 00:26:22,514
had all of his siblings powers. This includes
Zero-G's Gravity Control, allowing Powerhouse

298
00:26:22,554 --> 00:26:28,117
to negate or increase the effect of gravity
on himself and his close proximity and therefore

299
00:26:28,177 --> 00:26:34,061
able to lift any object no matter how heavy.
He also has his sister Julie's Lightspeed Acceleration

300
00:26:34,101 --> 00:26:39,204
powers, allowing him to fly at supersonic speeds
and teleport. He also has his brother Jack's

301
00:26:39,284 --> 00:26:45,071
Mass Master powers, which allow him to turn
his body in super durable, and even shrink

302
00:26:45,091 --> 00:26:50,636
his size to about 8 inches tall. Powerhouse
also has his sister Katie's Energizer powers,

303
00:26:51,016 --> 00:26:55,920
which allow him to disintegrate and convert
any solid matter he touches into energy that

304
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:01,485
he can absorb and release as an energy blast.
This also lets him absorb other forms of energy

305
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:06,729
that he can then redirect. Though Powerhouse
is uniquely intelligent among his siblings

306
00:27:06,769 --> 00:27:10,813
as a former member of the Future Foundation,
all the Power Pack kids are somewhat gifted

307
00:27:10,853 --> 00:27:15,271
intellectually, And their costumes, made of
unstable molecules and chameleon technology,

308
00:27:15,691 --> 00:27:20,473
have pocket dimensions within their pockets
that let them carry a significant amount of

309
00:27:20,733 --> 00:27:25,095
stuff. Like what kind of stuff? A whole bunch
of stuff, man. You don't even know. Actually,

310
00:27:25,155 --> 00:27:30,877
I think that particular feature is what influenced
me to claim that Reed Richards probably had

311
00:27:30,917 --> 00:27:35,519
a pocket dimension in his unstable molecules
costume in his duel against Plastic Man. I

312
00:27:35,539 --> 00:27:39,181
knew I had read that somewhere. Like somebody
had a pocket dimension in their pocket. It

313
00:27:39,201 --> 00:27:45,977
was these guys. Okay. So just to double check,
light speed does not move at light speed. Well,

314
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:51,962
she could teleport, so kinda. Hmm. Okay. But
when she flies, it's usually defined as supersonic.

315
00:27:52,342 --> 00:27:57,527
I don't think she can actually fly at light
speeds. Okay. Not gonna lie, that's a pretty

316
00:27:57,607 --> 00:28:04,633
crazy power set. Luckily, though, Halo also
has a fairly robust power set, so let me get

317
00:28:04,653 --> 00:28:10,457
into her backstory. At the beginning of time,
when the universe first exploded into existence,

318
00:28:10,734 --> 00:28:16,661
from an energy known as the Source, some of
that energy coalesced into sentient orbs of

319
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:23,549
light known as oracles. The oracles, as beings
of energy that existed outside the physical

320
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:28,671
world, were created by lived for thousands of
years and multiplied, all the while observing

321
00:28:28,712 --> 00:28:33,574
the formation of the universe over billions
of years. While many oracles were attracted

322
00:28:33,614 --> 00:28:39,477
to stellar phenomena, observing cosmic-level
events from a distance, one oracle, however,

323
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:45,159
became more interested in organic sentient beings
and wondered what it would be like to experience

324
00:28:45,199 --> 00:28:52,002
sensations and emotions such as theirs. Eventually,
this oracle discovered Earth, and while investigating

325
00:28:54,504 --> 00:29:00,518
young woman in the country of Markovia during
a violent revolt against its monarchy. Moved

326
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:05,603
by the tragedy and attempting to reach out to
the young woman, The Oracle accidentally entered

327
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:11,007
the physical world and became trapped within
her body, bringing that young woman back to

328
00:29:11,067 --> 00:29:16,892
life, though she awoke with no memory of her
former life on Earth or as an Oracle. Seeing

329
00:29:16,952 --> 00:29:22,337
Batman upon her resurrection and being frightened,
she discovered that she had light-based superhuman

330
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:27,641
abilities. Nonetheless, she joined Batman and
helped him and the other heroes stop Baron

331
00:29:27,681 --> 00:29:33,338
Bedlam from overthrowing the Markovian monarchy,
of which the hero Geoforce was a part. whom

332
00:29:33,378 --> 00:29:38,840
you can learn more about in last week's Geoforce
vs Quake duel episode. Batman recruited the

333
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,663
heroes involved in protecting Markovia to form
a new Gotham City-based super team named the

334
00:29:44,763 --> 00:29:50,725
Outsiders. Still suffering from amnesia, though,
Halo adopted the civilian identity of Gabriel

335
00:29:50,825 --> 00:29:55,831
Doe. and she lived in the penthouse above the
Wayne Foundation building with the hero Kitana,

336
00:29:56,192 --> 00:30:01,374
who became Halo's legal guardian, and whom you
can learn more about in our Kitana vs. Elektra

337
00:30:01,414 --> 00:30:06,817
duel episode. With help from Batman's detective
skills, Halo eventually learned she was born

338
00:30:06,837 --> 00:30:12,559
with the name Violet Harper, from Arlington,
Missouri. She was a smart kid, but rebellious,

339
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:18,022
and as a teenager, she and her boyfriend stole
a drug formula from the mobster Tobias Whale.

340
00:30:21,604 --> 00:30:26,706
Whale sent an assassin known as Cyanide who
tracked the couple to the country of Markovia

341
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:32,829
where she successfully killed Violet. Unfortunately,
a visit to her parents Sam and Margaret in

342
00:30:32,869 --> 00:30:38,472
Missouri drew the attention of Tobias Whale,
who held them hostage in exchange for the drug

343
00:30:38,512 --> 00:30:44,295
formula, which Halo no longer remembered. Despite
calling on aid from the outsiders and managing

344
00:30:44,355 --> 00:30:50,526
to defeat Tobias Whale, Halo's parents were
killed by Cyanide in the ordeal. In an effort

345
00:30:50,566 --> 00:30:55,290
to learn more about her powers, Halo was brought
aboard the Justice League satellite headquarters,

346
00:30:55,610 --> 00:31:01,234
where the article within her regained its memory.
This event was observed by other articles,

347
00:31:01,554 --> 00:31:06,258
who took Halo into their ethereal dimension
with the intent to separate her article from

348
00:31:06,298 --> 00:31:12,554
her body, a process that would also return Violet
to her state of death. Fortunately, the Outsiders

349
00:31:12,594 --> 00:31:17,897
traveled to the Oracle Dimension and managed
to save Halo, and the Oracles agreed to allow

350
00:31:17,937 --> 00:31:23,840
the merger of Violet and the Oracle to exist
in peace. Halo left the Outsiders upon her

351
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:29,062
return in an effort to reconcile her identity
and find herself, though she ended up later

352
00:31:29,162 --> 00:31:34,364
accidentally joining the Cult of Cobra, who
tortured her to learn Batman's secret identity.

353
00:31:34,865 --> 00:31:41,248
Halo was rescued by the Outsiders, however,
after which she rejoined the team. Framed for

354
00:31:41,268 --> 00:31:46,431
the murder of the Queen of Markovia and became
fugitives on the run, Halo's rebellious Violet

355
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:53,216
Harper personality began to re-emerge and eventually
take control. Halo ended up betraying the Outsiders

356
00:31:53,256 --> 00:31:59,060
shortly before she was killed by a cyborg assassin
named Sanction, who also killed the woman who

357
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:05,424
hired him, Marissa Baron, the ex-wife of an
Outsiders team member named Technocrat. Like

358
00:32:05,464 --> 00:32:11,628
with Violet's body before, the article somehow
accidentally merged with Marissa, making her

359
00:32:11,688 --> 00:32:16,752
the new Halo. Though the Oracles returned to
reclaim their kin, they were fought off by

360
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:21,455
the Outsiders, after which the team was cleared
of any wrongdoing regarding the death of the

361
00:32:21,495 --> 00:32:28,379
Markovian Queen. Violet Harper's body, however,
was revived by Cobra and brainwashed into becoming

362
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:33,963
the villain Spectrum. The Outsiders eventually
disbanded and Halo appeared off and on throughout

363
00:32:33,983 --> 00:32:39,847
the years, aiding Markovia and other heroes
during large crises. Eventually, though it

364
00:32:39,887 --> 00:32:46,332
is unknown Now, Halo returned to the body of
Violet Harper, who joined a reformation of

365
00:32:46,352 --> 00:32:51,035
the outsiders following the death of Batman
at the hands of Darkseid. When the villain

366
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:55,979
Necron reanimated the dead heroes and villains
of the DC Universe, turning them into black

367
00:32:56,019 --> 00:33:02,431
lanterns, Halo, thanks to her light-based powers,
proved effective against the zombies, though

368
00:33:02,451 --> 00:33:09,034
she seemingly sacrificed herself while protecting
the outsiders, becoming pure light and dispersing.

369
00:33:09,494 --> 00:33:15,457
After the Flash reset DC's continuity, Violet
Harper was a drug addict imprisoned in Markovia,

370
00:33:15,557 --> 00:33:21,300
who later betrayed the location of Katana and
the Suicide Squad to the Cobra Cult in exchange

371
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:28,043
for narcotics. Cobra then experimented on Violet,
intending to use her as a weapon, but the kidnapped

372
00:33:29,764 --> 00:33:35,487
Violet with captured articles, betrayed Cobra,
and sabotaged a mind control device that would

373
00:33:35,507 --> 00:33:40,871
have allowed Cobra to control Violet's empowered
form. When Kitana and the Suicide Squad showed

374
00:33:40,931 --> 00:33:46,775
up shortly after Violet's procedure, the articles
burst from her body and tried to kill everyone,

375
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:53,399
though they all fled in fear when Kitana's sword
managed to kill one of them. All but one, that

376
00:33:53,479 --> 00:33:56,641
is, which had been bonded permanently to Violet's
body.

377
00:33:59,664 --> 00:34:06,625
Katana invited Violet to join her. And that's
her backstory. Powers-wise, Halo is an article-possessed

378
00:34:06,685 --> 00:34:13,047
human capable of manipulating the Halo, or aura-like
light that emanates from her, for a variety

379
00:34:13,087 --> 00:34:18,268
of effects that are indicated by a specific
color within the spectrum of light. When her

380
00:34:18,428 --> 00:34:25,246
aura is red, Halo can produce destructive heat-based
laser beams, and when it's orange, Those lasers

381
00:34:25,326 --> 00:34:31,209
are concussive instead. Jiki used both red and
orange light to create defensive shields as

382
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:38,412
well. Her yellow light is used to stun and blind
enemies in bright flashes, and her green light

383
00:34:38,573 --> 00:34:44,856
acts as a stasis beam to freeze enemies. Blue
light allows her to create holographic distortions,

384
00:34:44,996 --> 00:34:50,670
specifically duplicates of herself or other
objects. and Indigo Light can be used like

385
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:57,293
a tractor beam, allowing her to push, pull,
or lift objects. Violet Light grants her access

386
00:34:57,314 --> 00:35:03,056
to all of her abilities at once, though this
is rarely used because it also gives the unstable

387
00:35:03,116 --> 00:35:09,679
Violet Harper personality control over the body
they share. When glowing in any of these specific

388
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:15,582
colors, Halo is able to fly up to the speed
of light, which is her standard ability while

389
00:35:15,622 --> 00:35:21,624
glowing her standard white. mix too. It reminds
me that I have a bone to pick with the color

390
00:35:21,725 --> 00:35:27,747
indigo. I feel like that color between blue
and violet was only selected as part of the

391
00:35:27,787 --> 00:35:32,688
color spectrum to complete the ROYGBIV acronym,
which is, you know, red, orange, yellow, green,

392
00:35:32,728 --> 00:35:38,650
blue, indigo, violet, like NYX indigo and make
more room for cyan because cyan is definitely

393
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:45,052
a unique color between green and blue. I agree
with you 100% because honestly, it should just

394
00:35:45,092 --> 00:35:52,528
be red, yellow, green, sand, blue, magenta.
Purple. No, fuck purple and fuck orange. What?

395
00:35:53,069 --> 00:35:57,992
Yeah. Jesus. You heard me. Wow. You're just
talking about this character, right? Like the

396
00:35:58,012 --> 00:36:02,896
colors that she would have as a producer of
light, right? Right, exactly. Oh, she would

397
00:36:02,936 --> 00:36:08,940
have magenta light. Right, exactly. Yeah, makes
sense. But we digress heavily. That was some

398
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,681
inside graphic design baseball.

399
00:36:17,902 --> 00:36:23,564
Where fantasies collide and heroes clash, one
podcast network rises above the rest. Prepare

400
00:36:23,584 --> 00:36:29,307
yourself for the ultimate showdowns in comic
books, video games, movies, and anime. The

401
00:36:29,367 --> 00:36:35,069
DynaMic Podcast Network presents Console Combat,
where video game legends brawl every Monday.

404
00:36:50,328 --> 00:36:56,033
the matches and armed with the power of mathematical
simulations, discover who will emerge victorious.

Visit dynamicpodcast.com, where we settle the
debate and settle the score.

406
00:37:05,143 --> 00:37:09,005
But now that we've got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

407
00:37:09,105 --> 00:37:15,610
of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not this speculation,

408
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:21,434
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could
play out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?

409
00:37:22,314 --> 00:37:26,317
Well, I should say there are no rules, other
than the characters have no prior knowledge

410
00:37:26,337 --> 00:37:30,740
of the other going into the fight. All they
are aware of starting out is that the other

411
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:35,847
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.
For the speculation, the contestants will begin

412
00:37:35,888 --> 00:37:40,952
approximately 50 meters apart in a non-descript
environment that will have no bearing on the

413
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:46,336
match itself, as no environmental statistics
are considered in my simulations. The contestants

414
00:37:46,376 --> 00:37:51,541
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright
then, let's get into it. Halo and Powerhouse

415
00:37:51,621 --> 00:37:56,785
meet on the battlefield. Who goes first? Well,
since Halo moves faster, I'm gonna say she

416
00:37:56,825 --> 00:38:02,189
goes first. And she's gonna start by turning
yellow and flashing a bright yellow light that...

417
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:07,271
blinds powerhouse and while he's like oh i can't
see that's you know when she's going to blast

418
00:38:07,311 --> 00:38:12,453
him with an orange concussive beam just knocking
him backwards no because powerhouse's first

419
00:38:12,573 --> 00:38:19,055
instinct once he goes blind is going to be to
go intangible so he's going to access his brother

420
00:38:19,135 --> 00:38:24,116
jack's powers as mass master and he's going
to lower his density which turns him into this

421
00:38:24,156 --> 00:38:28,530
like gaseous form and this orange beam is just
going to pass right through him And, you know,

422
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:33,034
he's slowly regaining his sight and he's going
to float up into the air as this cloud. And

423
00:38:33,054 --> 00:38:37,958
when he can see again, once he gets his vision
back, Powerhouse is going to solidify out of

424
00:38:37,978 --> 00:38:43,442
this cloud form and he's going to increase his
mass and gravity so that he just drops onto

425
00:38:43,482 --> 00:38:47,745
Halo like an ocean tanker. But like fist first,
just slamming her and flattening her into the

426
00:38:47,785 --> 00:38:54,671
ground. Wait, so is Powerhouse visible in this
gaseous form? Yeah. Why? Okay, well, this isn't

427
00:38:54,691 --> 00:39:00,095
a surprise to Halo because, you know, she just
watches this whole thing unfold and as he's

428
00:39:00,135 --> 00:39:04,599
falling down on her, she's just going to turn
Indigo and send out a tractor beam that's going

429
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:11,605
to grab him and just slam him into the ground
away from her instead. Alright, but as Halo

430
00:39:11,645 --> 00:39:17,270
tries to slam him, Powerhouse is going to shrink.
He's going to decrease his size and mass to

431
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:22,970
about 8 inches tall. So instead of like slamming
him hard onto the ground, It's more like she

432
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:27,612
just gently sets him onto the ground because
he doesn't have the mass to support the slam.

433
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:34,575
And that's when Powerhouse is gonna grow to
normal height and he's gonna access his sister

434
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:39,557
Julie's light speed powers. So he's gonna fly
right at Halo at supersonic speed and just

435
00:39:39,637 --> 00:39:45,579
plow into her, breaking some ribs, knocking
the wind out of her. Okay, you know, Halo gets

436
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:51,798
hit, but as she's recovering, she glows green
and she's gonna zap Powerhouse. with the stasis

437
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:58,340
beam, just freezing him mid air to give her
time to finish recovering. And as he's frozen,

438
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:03,061
that's when she just goes out to him and just
kicks the shit out of him, like punching him

439
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:09,743
in the nose, kicking him in the spleen, and
he's just forced to take it. And Halo might

440
00:40:09,763 --> 00:40:14,705
get a few shots in, sure, but like only a few,
because powerhouse, he's just gonna teleport

441
00:40:14,765 --> 00:40:20,439
out of the stasis beam. And then he's- No, no,
no. He's completely frozen, like he can't even

442
00:40:20,499 --> 00:40:26,442
breathe in this thing. He takes those hits like
a real fucking man would. It's not like he

443
00:40:26,482 --> 00:40:31,785
needs to move in order to teleport. He can just
teleport out of the stasis beam. Is teleportation

444
00:40:31,945 --> 00:40:40,249
an action? No, it is. So he can't do it because
he's literally frozen in like space time. If

445
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:45,012
he was like frozen in a block of ice, he could
teleport easily. Same thing. No, she's not

446
00:40:45,112 --> 00:40:52,088
freezing him with cold. She's freezing Kim.
with energy, all right? Stasis field. He can't

447
00:40:52,108 --> 00:40:57,893
do shit. Okay, so like you'd rather punch a
little kid than say he's capable of teleporting

448
00:40:58,033 --> 00:41:06,219
out. I see how you are. She's a teenager too.
All right, okay, anyway. So Powerhouse teleports

449
00:41:06,279 --> 00:41:11,583
out of the stasis field. I'm just calling it.
I'm sorry, that's what he did. Although now

450
00:41:11,623 --> 00:41:16,666
I'm seeing the downside to not using the full
power pack team in the speculation. because

451
00:41:16,886 --> 00:41:21,167
as individuels, they can heal each other. And
so there's no one around to heal Powerhouse

452
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:25,408
from the wounds that he just received. But-
What power do they use to heal each other?

453
00:41:25,848 --> 00:41:30,509
They can like share each other's life force,
basically. Weird. I'm gonna say Powerhouse

454
00:41:30,549 --> 00:41:35,651
teleports right next to Halo and grabs her,
and he's gonna completely negate the effect

455
00:41:35,691 --> 00:41:39,732
of gravity on her, so she like weighs nothing.
And with that, he's just gonna toss her up

456
00:41:39,772 --> 00:41:45,533
into the air beyond the stratosphere. In the
air, okay, yeah, that's fine. From the stratosphere.

457
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:51,873
Halo is just gonna rain down these red lasers
just everywhere, burning up Powerhouse and

458
00:41:51,913 --> 00:41:57,776
the surrounding environment beneath him. Awesome.
Powerhouse gets hit by the lasers, sure, and

459
00:41:57,816 --> 00:42:02,839
the whole area around him is on fire, but he's
gonna absorb those heat beams with his sister

460
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:07,642
Katie's energizer powers. He absorbs the beams,
he's gonna absorb the flames all around him,

461
00:42:08,202 --> 00:42:13,585
so now he's just glowing with this bright yellow
energy and he's gonna fly up into the atmosphere

462
00:42:13,805 --> 00:42:19,598
to meet Halo. and he's just gonna fucking demolish
her with this massive energy blast that she

463
00:42:19,638 --> 00:42:24,802
fueled him with and it's just gonna obliterate
her. Oh no, she's obliterated. You know what's

464
00:42:24,822 --> 00:42:31,928
crazy though? What? That halo that he saw and
obliterated was just an illusion generated

465
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:39,395
by Halo's blue aura. The real Halo is actually
coming in fast behind Powerhouse and just slams

466
00:42:39,455 --> 00:42:45,114
into him at near light speed with a red force
field. disintegrating him instantly instead

467
00:42:45,534 --> 00:42:51,916
because she could actually travel at light speed
unlike his sister. Oh shit, more child abuse.

468
00:42:52,296 --> 00:42:58,538
I see. Just the splattering powerhouse make
Halo feel like more of a woman beating up on

469
00:42:58,578 --> 00:43:03,379
kids like that. It's child on child crime. Like
what has powerhouse been doing this whole time

470
00:43:03,419 --> 00:43:09,221
but hitting a girl. Halo's not a girl. She's
like a alien zombie. There's a difference.

471
00:43:09,441 --> 00:43:16,928
Yeah, an alien zombie girl. I feel like that's
a Rob Zombie like alien zombie girl. Na na

472
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:24,212
na. We can leave the match there before we run
the simulations. So either Halo obliterates

473
00:43:24,272 --> 00:43:29,855
Powerhouse by slamming into him at light speed
with a force field or Powerhouse obliterates

474
00:43:29,995 --> 00:43:34,818
Halo with a giant energy blast. Well, go ahead
and input the character stats, run the simulations

475
00:43:34,938 --> 00:43:42,418
and come back with a winner. AG9K, hit it. Inputting
data, running calculations. Processing results

476
00:43:42,919 --> 00:43:47,944
simulations complete. All right, not being too
familiar with either of these characters I

477
00:43:47,984 --> 00:43:53,209
have no idea how these results are gonna go
I'm not gonna be surprised either way whether

478
00:43:53,249 --> 00:43:58,674
power pack or halo win because I feel like you
know They both have a grab bag of powers some

479
00:43:58,714 --> 00:44:04,319
of them fairly random Seemingly and I think
that just gonna make the results kind of random.

480
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:10,264
Yeah, the characters seem to be like either
really strong in a stat or incredibly weak

481
00:44:10,344 --> 00:44:14,987
considering that, you know, they're children.
So like when it came to fighting skill, intelligence

482
00:44:15,047 --> 00:44:20,972
or perception, they were very, very low. But
like you look at speed and versatility, you

483
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:26,556
know, Halo was maxed out on those. And then
you look at things like evasiveness and strength,

484
00:44:26,716 --> 00:44:31,119
Power Pack was maxed out on those. So you're
right, there's not a whole lot of in between

485
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,294
either they are really good at a stat or they
really suck. I think what really surprised

486
00:44:35,334 --> 00:44:40,637
me was that they actually were pretty comparable
when it came to damage level. I thought Halo

487
00:44:40,657 --> 00:44:45,460
was going to take it on that one, but you know,
considering powerhouse could use Energizer's

488
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:50,863
powers to basically do the same kind of destructive
beams that she could do. Yeah, they're pretty

489
00:44:50,883 --> 00:44:55,625
much the same. Well Energizer's powers aren't
represented as beams. They're more like energy

490
00:44:55,765 --> 00:45:00,528
balls. But yeah, I mean, she can disintegrate
any form of solid matter and convert it into

491
00:45:00,608 --> 00:45:04,930
energy, which you know, has a lot of destructive
potential on its own. even without the energy

492
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:09,993
blasts. Both characters were actually fairly
weak when it came to durability. That's another

493
00:45:10,033 --> 00:45:13,395
thing that I thought was pretty surprising.
Although Power Pack had the slight edge there

494
00:45:13,435 --> 00:45:18,837
because Masked Master can increase his density
to become more durable. Considering all these

495
00:45:18,858 --> 00:45:24,701
stats, Jonathan, who do you think is going to
win this match? I have no idea, honestly. I'm

496
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:31,965
rooting for Halo though, and so are our followers
on Instagram. 65% of them who voted in the

497
00:45:32,005 --> 00:45:36,359
poll voted for Halo. The power pack, they're
a bunch of cute kids. Why wouldn't you vote

498
00:45:36,379 --> 00:45:41,983
for them? You know, it's kind of weird. Because
they're a bunch of fucking kids. I guess they

499
00:45:42,003 --> 00:45:47,186
got that going for and against them. I say that
like I don't have kids. Grace, Faith, I love

500
00:45:47,206 --> 00:45:53,371
you girls. Well, let's go ahead and find out
who won. AG9K, the results please. Here you

501
00:45:53,491 --> 00:46:04,978
are, sir. All right, the winner between Halo
and Power Pack is Power Pack. Dang it! And

502
00:46:05,038 --> 00:46:10,779
you know what? It wasn't really that close.
Out of a thousand matches, Power Pack won 654

503
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:20,262
battles, whereas Halo only won 346. So Power
Pack's win rate was 65.4%, whereas Halo's win

504
00:46:20,302 --> 00:46:27,804
rate was only 34.6%. Really? Ah, the Power Pack
essentially wins two-thirds of the time. Yeah,

505
00:46:27,984 --> 00:46:32,365
pretty much. Essentially the few things that
gave Power Pack an edge over Halo were durability.

506
00:46:32,546 --> 00:46:37,968
but also intellect, you know, when factoring
in Alex Powers' high intelligence. You know,

507
00:46:37,988 --> 00:46:42,811
he was a member of the Future Foundation. Reed
Richards himself said he was around postgraduate

508
00:46:42,851 --> 00:46:48,734
level intelligence at the age of 19. So despite
the fact that Power Pack also has Katie, who's

509
00:46:48,754 --> 00:46:54,177
a young kid, who's, you know, not as brilliant,
when you average everything out, Power Pack

510
00:46:54,217 --> 00:46:58,740
still had a slight edge in intelligence over
Halo. Which is fair, because I feel like a

511
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:05,322
teenager stealing a drug formula from a mobster
pretty dumb. It's not that smart of a teenager.

512
00:47:05,862 --> 00:47:11,564
Makes sense. Is it kind of embarrassing though
to be eked out by the intelligence stat? Because

513
00:47:11,604 --> 00:47:16,425
I feel like that would be pretty embarrassing,
especially from a group of kids. Well, I mean,

514
00:47:16,485 --> 00:47:22,707
honestly, I kind of had to average out her intelligence
stat as well, considering that the article

515
00:47:22,727 --> 00:47:27,968
within her is actually thousands of years old
and has amassed quite a bit of knowledge that

516
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:33,586
said she doesn't really have access to it and
she never really uses it. and the merged halo

517
00:47:33,826 --> 00:47:39,288
combined persona in a majority of her depictions
has amnesia. So she doesn't really know anything,

518
00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:44,150
unfortunately. Does she have amnesia currently
in the comics? From the last thing I read from

519
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:49,533
her, yeah, she's still kind of learning who
she is while living with Katana. She's very

520
00:47:49,553 --> 00:47:54,955
much dependent on her. Okay, makes sense, makes
sense then. So this is a great win for Marvel.

521
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:59,777
I encourage a lot of listeners out there to
go check out Power Pack in Marvel Comics. Actually,

522
00:47:59,797 --> 00:48:06,168
a lot of their best stories. do not take place
in the 616 main Marvel timeline, but rather

523
00:48:06,268 --> 00:48:12,071
the more kid-targeted comics called Marvel Age.
That's its own continuity. But they're quite

524
00:48:12,111 --> 00:48:16,354
accessible for kids, the Power Pack. As a matter
of fact, my daughter, who's one year old now,

525
00:48:16,534 --> 00:48:19,836
when the time comes for her to start reading
comics and stuff and getting introduced to

526
00:48:19,876 --> 00:48:24,458
Marvel, I think I'm going to start off with
Power Pack. And then from there, around age

527
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:29,961
seven or whatnot, I'll introduce her to Spidey
and the Fantastic Four. And then from there,

528
00:48:30,454 --> 00:48:35,417
like around 11 or 12, probably get into more
of like the X-Men and the deeper themes and

529
00:48:35,457 --> 00:48:39,621
stuff like that. Yeah, which is like the limit
for Marvel, like 11 and 12 year olds could

530
00:48:39,661 --> 00:48:45,485
read X-Men. You know, DC has the real highbrow
stuff. So like when she's turning 16, totally

531
00:48:45,525 --> 00:48:50,309
getting her sand man. You're not going to poison
my daughter's mind with it. That bullcrap.

532
00:48:51,818 --> 00:48:56,320
I mean, Marvel has the Max line, so when Ella
becomes even older, you know, she could start

533
00:48:56,340 --> 00:49:00,382
reading Max comics if she wants. I don't fucking
know. I don't even know if she'll be into comics,

534
00:49:00,422 --> 00:49:05,765
but we'll see. I can introduce her to DC super
pets because that's pretty kid friendly. No!

535
00:49:06,205 --> 00:49:12,688
Well, fine then. Geez. Not poisoning her mind,
I just said. Well, I guess that does it for

536
00:49:12,728 --> 00:49:20,390

So we're going to have a little 4th of July

543
00:49:53,764 --> 00:49:58,145
themed episode for you guys, where we're going
to find out who to win in a fight between Uncle

544
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:05,687
Sam, who was like the personification of American
patriotism and Captain Britain, who is a hero

545
00:50:05,727 --> 00:50:12,209
from the British Isles. I'm just glad that I
am on the side of America and you're a frigging

546
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:17,680
red coat. Yeah, I don't love that. But Captain
Britain is more awesome than Uncle Sam, who's

547
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:22,344
kind of a lame ass character, so yeah, I'm gonna
win this next one too. We'll see. But that

548
00:50:22,364 --> 00:50:26,407
