This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi, welcome to
the DynaMic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:33,220
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:38,800
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin

4
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:45,520
brother, Marvelous Joe. And in this episode, we
are reviewing Netflix's Season 2 of The Sandman

5
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:52,940
series. It's a fantastic series based off of one of
the best graphic novels ever made, definitely one

6
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:59,680
of my favorites, so I can't wait to talk about
Season 2. Yeah, not just one of your favorites. I'm

7
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,940
going to say probably the best adapted graphic
novel to television ever put out there. And

8
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:12,480
there's not many direct adaptations of graphic
novels out there, but this definitely sets a high

9
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:17,040
bar for future ones. We're going to talk about the
show later on in this episode. Before that, we're

10
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,640
going to break down the comic book movie news from
the past week, of which we just got a rinky dink look

11
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,900
at the new Spider suit for Spider-Man Brand New
Day. Yeah, rinky dink is the operative term right

12
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,560
there, for sure. As always, we list our segment
times in our episode description, so feel free to

notes to listen to all of the shows in the Dynamite
Podcast Network. But with that out of the way,

33
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:27,380
quick to the no prize! A no prize is an award that
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version, the

34
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:32,520
Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award we post on
Instagram for the person that we feel gave the best

35
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:38,580
answer to our question of the week. Last week we
asked you guys, if you could reimagine a Marvel or

36
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:44,440
DC superhero in an ancient culture, what
superhero and culture would you choose? This is

37
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:50,920
coming off of the trailer we got for Aztec Batman,
which reimagines the origins of Batman in the

38
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,660
ancient Aztec culture. We got quite a few answers,
we're going to break down this week's 3 honorable

39
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:01,620
mentions before revealing the no prize winner.
Our first honorable mention goes to... By Dear

40
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:07,840
Bangura. Who said? The character I would choose to
change arrows would be Punisher. I would put him in

41
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,120
pre-colonial West Africa. He would most likely
have a story where his family was killed by the

42
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,500
French or another superpower at the time. And he
would be there to free slaves to avenge those that

43
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:25,680
were taking and to make sure the freedom had spread
out throughout the continent. He would be a power

44
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,400
for a lot of other characters, he would be the
strength of Africa and he would make sure that his

45
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,480
story changes. And right out of the gate with a
pretty hardcore answer, By Dear suggested a West

46
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:46,340
African Punisher set during the early days of the
slave trade. And that would be crazy to watch. I

47
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:52,480
could imagine a West African soldier donning the
emblem of the skull and they don't have guns at the

48
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:59,280
time, right? So he'd probably use a sword or a spear
and he's just avenging the murder of his family.

49
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,480
Now the Punisher in the comic book isn't really
altruistic and fight for a larger goal of freeing

50
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:08,060
slaves or anything like that. He just kills
because he hates criminals. And this version of

51
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:14,080
the Punisher I don't think would be fighting
necessarily just to prevent slavery but largely

52
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,740
out of his anger for the people capturing slaves.
Right, he doesn't kill out of vengeance, he kills

53
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:25,900
out of punishment. Great answer by Dear, our next
honorable mention goes to Scott Camacho who said,

54
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:33,320
Ancient cultures. Hmm, let's see. My characters
would be the Justice League and I want to see them

55
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:42,620
portrayed in ancient Egypt. Superman is raw,
Wonder Woman as segment, the Flash as shoe and

56
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:49,580
Aquaman as sabok. The aesthetic of it would look
amazing. I love that idea. I think that's a really

57
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:55,760
cool idea. The Egyptian pantheon could very much
be like a superhero team. So to translate those

58
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,800
characters so well into their Justice League
counterparts, like right when he said Egyptian, I

59
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:06,760
already knew like what deities he was going to
connect to the Justice League characters. I love

60
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,580
that choice. I think that would be a really cool
aesthetic as well. And then you could say that

61
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,300
Superman was behind the pyramids or something
like the Egyptian pyramids were the remains of the

62
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,960
ships that were sent from Krypton or something
like that. It writes itself. Great answer Scotty,

63
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,340
our next honorable mention goes to Lorenzo Valdez
who said, This is Lorenzo Valdez calling in once

64
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:32,560
again. My idea is basically going off of what
Smallville did with Native American culture with

65
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:39,800
the Kowachi Caves, but taking it a step further and
setting the story before America was colonized

66
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:47,780
and having a Native American version of Lana Lang
and Kal-El arrives and having the story go from

67
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,720
there and explore Native American culture even
further. Kalana forever and always. Bye-bye.

68
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:59,020
Yeah, I'm not sure if the Kowachi tribe was real. I
think Kansas was actually populated by like the

69
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:07,120
Osage. Yeah, them and the Wichita and the Pani and
the Kansa according to Google. Either way, I think

70
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,640
the Kryptonian ship landing in pre-colonial
America would make for an awesome story. I'm not

71
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:17,540
sure how it would affect his upbringing and how he
would turn out as a character. It would be really

72
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:22,300
interesting to explore. Yeah, it'd be kind of
dangerous because I imagine he would be revered as

73
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:28,280
a God during that time. And how would he not let that
go to his head? That's the tricky part. He'd have to

74
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,120
have astute parents and maybe he would. Maybe they
would teach him about humility. It could be

75
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,260
awesome. Kind of like Superman Red Sun,
reimagined him landing in Soviet Russia. Landing

76
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:43,200
in pre-colonial America can make for a damn good
story too. Great answer, Lorenzo. We want to give a

77
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:49,900
quick shout out to Alex Albro and Cade Lehmann for
taking the time to visit our website and record an

78
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:56,200
answer. Yeah, Alex was not able to record an
answer, but he did write in suggesting an ancient

79
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,560
Greek Steve Rogers who fights against the
mythical Hydra. I thought that was pretty cool.

80
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,620
And Cade Lehmann suggested an ice man who was born
in Antarctica. But the winner of this week's No

81
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:12,260
Prize is Travis Herndon, who said... What's up,
the name of the dude is Travis here. Shout out to my

82
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:18,880
evil twin. So my answer will be Ghost Rider in
Nordic culture. Magi is seeing a badass Viking

83
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:26,820
Ghost Rider going around hacking dudes up with
dual axes and other Viking style weapons. And

84
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:32,679
that's for his vehicle, a Viking ship. And before
you say it, when it comes to land, it's being

85
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:38,500
carried by the souls of the damned while he's on
land. So I'm mad at seeing that charging at you. Oh,

86
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:45,600
shit. That's hardcore. That is so hardcore. You
know, Ghost Rider has always been pretty metal,

87
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,900
but I think this would just take that to the next
level with a Viking Ghost Rider who wields twin

88
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,640
battle axes. And I mentioned there will still be
chains on those and everything like that. He'd

89
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:00,200
probably have a fiery skull underneath his Viking
helmet. But what really sold me on this was

90
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:05,960
Travis's idea for his vehicle to be a Viking ship
that rides on the souls of the damned. And I don't

91
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:11,560
know if that would look like it was sailing on fire
or if it was sailing off of skeletons carrying it or

92
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:17,080
whatever, but either way, that's fucking badass.
That actually needs to be a thing. Like, I don't

93
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:23,640
care if it's a toy or a comic arc. That should be
real. Yeah, they've explored multiple Ghost

94
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,920
Riders throughout history in the comic books, but
I don't remember there being a Viking one. So yeah,

95
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,300
they could totally kind of tack that on there.
Great answer, Travis. You win this week's No

96
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:36,900
Price. If you the listener want to shut in winning
your own No Price, stay tuned to later on in this

97
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:47,120
episode when we'll be asking another question of
the week. But now that that's done, on to the news.

98
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,720
All right, this past week we got our first look at
Tom Holland's new Spider-Man suit that he's going

99
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:58,760
to wear in Spider-Man brand new day, which is being
directed by Daniel Destin Cretan and being filmed

100
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:05,520
right now. I believe they're currently filming in
Scotland, actually. And the way that Sony went

101
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:10,640
about revealing it wasn't the most exciting. They
kind of like showed this animatic of what the suit

102
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,180
could look like, but it was mostly in shadow and it
was only like a 9 second video. That wasn't really

103
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,840
worth talking about. And then there was also this
other video of Tom Holland coming out from behind a

104
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,780
door and, you know, he's like pumped to start
filming and he's wearing the suit. I was largely

105
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:30,060
unimpressed by the suit. But since those videos
have come out, better high res versions of the suit

106
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:35,960
were taken during the production of the movie and
they give us a much clearer look of what the new suit

107
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:40,860
is going to look like. And I will say it's not the
same suit that we saw at the end of Spider-Man No Way

108
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:47,560
Home, where that one was like kind of shiny. It had
more of a cyan blue color. It was pretty basic. This

109
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:53,460
new suit is also pretty basic, but it kind of feels a
lot more similar to the suits that he's had in the

110
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:59,180
past. If anything, actually the suit that it
reminds me most of is Andrew Garfield's from the

111
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:05,740
amazing Spider-Man 2, although the blue on this
suit is not quite as dark as that one was. And that

112
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:10,680
was a great suit. That was a fantastic suit. That
one had more like a navy color and this new

113
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:16,240
Spider-Man suit is more like a cobalt blue is what
I'll say. I gotta say it's more spandexy feeling

114
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,060
than I would have thought. Like I know he made his
costume at the very end of the last movie, but this

115
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,300
one definitely has that more homemade feel I would
say. And I don't know if it's just because of the

116
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:32,020
harnesses that he was wearing on set. Maybe
they'll just smooth out all the wrinkles in post,

117
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:37,220
but that was my first impression. Yeah, same here.
The material seems a lot thinner than the suits

118
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:43,040
that he's worn in the past, especially the ones
that were created by Tony Stark. Those seemed a lot

119
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:48,680
more heavy duty. But that's why I compared this
suit to the amazing Spider-Man 2 suit because when

120
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:54,380
Spider-Man was swinging through the city in that
movie, like the wind was like ruffling the spandex

121
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:59,200
of his outfit because the material was so thin,
right? Here you could also tell that the material

122
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:06,040
is similarly thin. The emblem is not quite as large
as Andrew Garfield's was. The mask is very similar

123
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:11,980
to his very first mask in Homecoming. But what's
interesting with this new suit is that his web

124
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:17,000
shooters look a whole lot different than they did
in previous films. They almost look like steel

125
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,080
drinking flasks attached to his wrists. They are
very prominent in this new suit. I don't know how I

126
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:29,120
feel about that because they seem like they would
make for easy targets for bad guys, right? To just

127
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,320
take out his web shooters. But they're there and
it'll be interesting to see how they look in

128
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,140
battle. I'm sad that we're going to lose a lot of the
cool features that Spider-Man had throughout his

129
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:46,000
initial trilogy. Where he had the web gliders and
the Spidey signal, Spider Tracers, things like

130
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,320
that. Things that he kind of developed over time in
the comic books and incorporated into his suit.

131
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,760
That I thought kind of added to his appeal as
somewhat of a tech hero and that he has a lot of

132
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,780
homemade tech that he incorporates. I hope he has
something going for him just beyond the web

133
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:05,480
shooters. Just because I don't know, I just really
like the web gliders I always have on his suit. I do

134
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:11,200
think that in modern Spider-Man movies there does
need to be at least two or three different

135
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,960
iterations of the suits. I mean, look at the last
film, how many he had. They'll come up with some

136
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:21,600
excuse to make some kind of toy wearing some kind of
different suit. So I'd be surprised if this was the

137
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,140
only one in the film. I think you're right. Yeah, I
think you're absolutely right. Although, you

138
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:31,500
know, this is rumored to be more of a street level
style Spider-Man movie, so we'll see. That being

139
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:36,460
said, if this is a street level Spider-Man outfit,
I'm totally for it. It looks very classic in that

140
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:41,720
regard. You'll just have bullet riddled
Spider-Man suit full of holes. Battle damaged

141
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,780
Spidey. That'll be the new action figure they
sell. But there's not really too much else to

142
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,160
comment on the suits. I'm sure we'll have a whole
lot more to say when they start releasing

143
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:53,660
marketing for the film, which won't be for a while
because they just started filming. So we probably

144
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:58,120
won't see like a trailer or anything until the end
of this year. Or maybe even after that because

145
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:03,480
really the Spider-Man movie doesn't come out
until July 31st, almost a whole year from now in

146
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:09,500
2026. I'm not sure how this particular suit will
rank among all of the Spider-Man suits throughout

147
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:19,700
all of his films. But on that topic, we have our
question of the week. What was the best live action

148
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:26,560
Spider-Man suits? And just for funsies, what was
the best Batman suits? And why? Yeah, we want an

149
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,100
answer for the best Spider-Man outfit and the best
Batman outfit. Just a tight DC in there. Jonathan

150
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,440
is going on vacation this next week, so we're going
to let this question of the week run for a couple of

all of the news for this episode. Now let's go ahead
and move on to the main event where we review

157
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:33,260
Netflix's The Sandman Season 2. The Sandman
Season 2 Alright, The Sandman Season 2 is the

158
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:39,200
bittersweet conclusion of a dark fantasy epic
adapted from the award-winning DC Comics and

159
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:45,040
Vertigo Comics series, written by Neil Gaiman.
It's easily one of my favorite comic series of all

160
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:51,080
time and I truly loved Season 1. I actually
rewatched all of the first season in lead-up to

161
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,700
Season 2, which is something I've actually never
done before, but I knew I wanted to get the full

162
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:01,300
Sandman experience leading up to the saga's
bittersweet end. In my review of Season 1, I said

163
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:07,080
that while it was a faithful and worthwhile
adaptation, the books were better, only because

164
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:13,260
the story of Sandman has so many individual
threads and yarns to borrow an analogy from the

165
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:19,620
kindly ones that are seemingly separate until, as
the series progresses, you realize are part of a

166
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:26,400
much broader and beautiful tapestry. Season 2 is
missing a lot of those threads because while

167
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:35,640
Season 1 adapted volumes 1 and 2, Season 2 only
adapts 4 of the remaining 8 volumes of story. And

168
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:41,480
while you'd think missing half the story would
result in only half a tapestry, somehow the

169
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:47,060
showrunner Alan Heindberg and director Jamie
Childs, as well as the cast, were able to weave

170
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:52,380
something together that's a little bit smaller,
but still beautiful and still profound. If you

171
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:58,080
haven't seen this season or this series, I highly
recommend it. Please don't listen any further

172
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:03,900
because this story, unlike a lot of projects we
review, has a definitive, somewhat

173
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:09,560
unconventional end that you don't want spoiled
for yourself. No, definitely watch the series.

174
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:14,640
Don't listen to us just talk about the series. Go
watch Sandman, people. It's so good. There were so

175
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,760
many times when I was watching this show, because
my wife wasn't able to watch it with me this time,

176
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:26,180
that I just hoped that someone would walk in on me
watching it and just be transfixed by everything

177
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:32,680
going on. Because there's so much beauty in this
show. It is by far the best made comic book

178
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:38,960
adaptation on television and maybe even the best
looking adaptation on film, too. It's

179
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,660
incredible. And if you like dark fantasy, the
story is right up your alley as well. Just go watch

180
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:53,660
it. Go watch the Sandman. Go watch it! What are you
still doing here? No, yeah, it does not really get

181
00:17:53,660 --> 00:18:00,160
better than the Sandman on multiple levels, from
production to writing to acting, just

182
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:06,480
everything. It was so good. Now, as we mentioned in
our review of the first season, Sandman for the

183
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:12,740
longest time was considered unadaptable because
of how dense the source material is. I was pretty

184
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:18,380
nervous going into season one, but even more so
going into season two, because I knew how much

185
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:23,260
ground the writers were going to have to cover in
such a short time span, considering they

186
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:28,820
announced that season two was going to be the final
season. And as I was watching the show, I was

187
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:34,500
legitimately amazed at how well they were able to
work in nearly all of my favorite moments from the

188
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:41,000
comics in a way that felt much more organic than I
expected it to. Like, Amidst Summer Night's

189
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,660
Dream, for example, that was something of a
standalone issue in the comic, but they worked it

190
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:51,500
into a flashback for the show. There were a lot of
smart choices on display here that came across as

191
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:57,800
very well thought out and planned at length, and I
appreciated that as I was watching this season.

192
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:03,040
Yeah, it's kind of a master craft in story weaving
on behalf of the screenwriters here. And, you

193
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,740
know, we have some veterans like Allen Heinberg,
David Goyer. Neil Gaiman himself was involved.

194
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:13,760
Yeah, we don't want to talk about him, though. No.
But, yeah, they did a really good job. I mean, you

195
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,980
got to think about just how much story they had to
condense. Well, again, there's a lot left out

196
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,800
because they only adapted four of the remaining
eight, but they did a fantastic job adapting

197
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:28,280
those. It's like you said, a masterwork. I'm
assuming the remaining volumes focused on the new

198
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:34,360
Sandman. No, the remaining volumes were
essentially anthological stories, though one of

199
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:39,080
them was Amidst Summer Night's Dream. So they
still were able to sneak some of those in their

200
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,620
different ways. Now, one of the great things about
the story of Sandman and what drew me to the comics

201
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:50,060
back when I read them in high school is that because
it's essentially a story about stories, it's not

202
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:57,480
necessarily bound to any particular setting or
time, genre, or even cast of characters. There are

203
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,480
seemingly entire volumes of the Sandman comic
series that are simply a collection of

204
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,060
anthological short stories. That is, until you
get closer to the end of the entire series and you

205
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:13,800
begin to realize that it's all connected, that
really every story was part of a much bigger

206
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:19,700
picture. You're kind of just along for the ride for
most of the series under the impression that this

207
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:27,140
is a story that could be endless. It's kind of the
promise made at the very start that dream stories

208
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:33,400
can and will go on forever. That is, until you
realize that this whole thing was really a setup

209
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:40,080
for how and why an endless being, a God
essentially, would come to accept death. And not

210
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,880
in any kind of macabre way, but in a way that makes
you feel like you truly lived an entire life with a

211
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:54,160
character and understand his decisions. Yes, the
story of a selfish God growing and changing and in a

212
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,540
sense becoming more human. Right, exactly. Yeah,
that's a great description of it. It's a very

213
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:05,820
existential work. And while I wouldn't exactly
say season two concluded with the same level of

214
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:11,360
existentialism as the books where you finish the
last page of the book and look up and you're like,

215
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,320
wait, I'm in a bookstore. I'm not in the dreaming. I
will say that because this television adaptation

216
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:24,480
is so hyper focused on dream story, which is a story
about life. It still manages to transcend and be

217
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:31,560
almost unbound by theme. It's not only a story
about life, but about death and mortality and

218
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:37,600
grief and responsibility, love and
relationships, personal growth, destiny and

219
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:44,220
free will. It's literally and literally about
everything. Yeah, I think I mentioned in our

220
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:49,840
review of season one that the whole Sandman series
kind of seemed to be a grand experiment by the

221
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,800
author Neil Gaiman. Every time I say his name, I do
want to make sure I clarify that the dude is a

222
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:59,580
fucking dickhole. But yeah, the Sandman series
was, I think, his grand experiment regarding the

223
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:05,280
topics of life and death and love. Yeah, there's a
lot of aspects about it that feel experimental and

224
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:11,720
indie in that way. Very creative in a way that is
unconventional, I think, for the medium. Now,

225
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:17,980
while I'm sincerely impressed with how well they
were able to wrap up dream story in a single season,

226
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:23,960
I'd be lying if I said I didn't wish this show could
have gone on for another four or five seasons. It

227
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,840
would have been better, but also pretty damn
expensive. Each episode of this season cost about

228
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:37,220
$15 million to make, making it one of the most
expensive shows ever produced. But it shows even

229
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,400
more so this season compared to last, in my
opinion. I agree. Like, I thought the

230
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:46,540
cinematography and costuming were noticeably
better this round, having watched both seasons

231
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:53,200
back to back. And the visual effects, for sure.
Merv Pumpkinhead, he felt so real. For me, I think

232
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:58,200
the best visual effect throughout the entire
course of this season was actually the

233
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:03,380
underworld. The Greek underworld ruled by Hades
and Persephone. There were so many moments

234
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:09,280
throughout the course of this show where I felt
truly transported, and the whole adaptation of

235
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,860
the Orpheus and Eurydice story was such a perfect
translation of the Greek myth that I think someone

236
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:20,620
even like Christopher Nolan, who's currently
shooting the Odyssey, is going to have a run for his

237
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:26,240
money in how well these Greek tragedies appear on
screen. There's just something so transportive

238
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:33,220
about the Sandman. Yeah, there's very few people
who could do mythology as well as Neil Gaiman. Even

239
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:38,860
with his other books, like American Gods and stuff
like that, a lot of that spills over into his

240
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:44,240
Sandman universe. And yeah, it's captivating. We
see multiple pantheons here. We see a lot of

241
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,800
different characters. There's so many
characters in the Sandman saga, but let's dive

242
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:55,960
into a few in our character breakdown. Starting
with Dream, played by Tom Sturridge. Now, I think

243
00:23:55,960 --> 00:24:01,740
Tom was born to play this role. I know you mentioned
in our last review that his voice was too

244
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:07,980
theatrical, but like I also mentioned, I think the
choice to make his voice consistent while leaving

245
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:14,200
the subtle emotions to play out on his face worked
really well. I saw an interview where Tom said he

246
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:20,120
asked Neil Gaiman how Dream should sound, and his
response was that Dream should sound like the

247
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:26,280
voice in your head when you're thinking. Quiet,
but also with an authoritative tinge as well as one

248
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:32,640
of seduction and terror. I think that's a lot to ask
of an actor, but I think Tom did a great job. That's

249
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,760
not what the voice in my head sounds like. The voice
in my head sounds like this. I wonder what's in the

250
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:44,220
pantry for dinner. What does your voice sound
like? My inner voice, just like my regular voice,

251
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:49,980
but I wouldn't describe my regular voice as any of
those things. I feel bad for you. My voice is hella

252
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:56,740
seductive. Regarding Sturridge's performance,
I think I did criticize it saying that it was too

253
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:02,720
operatic, I think. And so it kind of came across as
forced and maybe even a little bit corny at times

254
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:09,040
for season one. But I think having seen season one,
I totally understand what he's doing. These are

255
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:15,080
larger than life characters. He's the fucking
embodiment of an abstract concept. He shouldn't

256
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:20,120
really humanize his performance. Maybe it should
be larger than life, and so I definitely had less

257
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,300
issue with it. I agree. I think maybe the guy was
born to play Dream of the Endless. He had the look

258
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,920
down better in this season than I think even last
season, which I didn't think was possible. And

259
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:36,300
plus, it was really easy to see his growth in his
performance going from someone who is so

260
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:42,220
emotional, yet so completely lacking empathy.
He's basically a sociopath who really comes to

261
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:48,360
humble himself and better himself throughout the
entire season. You see that. Right, exactly.

262
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:54,400
Dream's arc is ultimately about accepting
responsibility. He was this godlike being who was

263
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,720
incredibly humbled in the first season in which we
saw him work to regain his power and restore his

264
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:06,660
realm. But in season two, now that he and his realm
are back to full power, we see how the events of the

265
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:12,000
first season have changed him and caused him to
recognize that he doesn't just have a

266
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,060
responsibility to the dreaming, but for his past
hurtful actions that he would have otherwise

267
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:25,560
overlooked as a prideful and all-powerful deity.
Humility fosters empathy, and with his newfound

268
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:32,300
empathy comes newfound emotions like regret, but
also love. Yeah, I think early on he largely

269
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:38,780
confused desire with love, which may have been in
part due to the machinations of his sibling

270
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:43,100
desire. But through the course of the story, he
really comes to understand what actual love is.

271
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:48,460
And that is something worth dying for.
Absolutely. You know, not a told him 10,000 years

272
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:54,620
ago that she doesn't believe his kind is capable of
love, and he punished her for it because I feel like

273
00:26:54,620 --> 00:27:00,520
he was afraid that was true. In the same way that his
parents didn't love him because when you're that

274
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:06,560
powerful and that important relationships and
love get in the way of duty and responsibility. But

275
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:13,640
dream realizes the season that he does love and has
hurt the ones he loves and in an effort to make

276
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:19,600
things right, willingly puts himself in the
position of undergoing the ultimate act of love,

277
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,040
which is to sacrifice yourself to protect your
loved ones. I believe that's what love really is.

278
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:31,400
Attention and sacrifice. And dream found himself
incapable of ignoring those that truly matter to

279
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:37,480
him, whether it was Nada in Hell, Delirium,
sulking in her realm, Orpheus on that Greek

280
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:44,260
island, or his staff in his palace being
destroyed. Dream chooses death not only out of

281
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:51,380
love, but because dream is bound by his identity by
function rules and ritual in a way that he sees

282
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:58,660
others of equal station are not Lucifer gives up on
her domain and so does destruction. But dream

283
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:04,460
cannot do that. He's seen what happens when his
realm is abandoned and he refuses to have that

284
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:10,840
happen again, taking steps to ensure the dreaming
will survive and be cared for after he's gone. And

285
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:17,320
yet, he also refuses to bear the burden of killing
another innocent in Light of Hall. His death is

286
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:24,900
both destiny and free will, both bound to happen,
yet also a conscious choice made by dream, because

287
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:31,520
he refuses to change back to the kind of being he
once was. And now has the courage to let go of

288
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:37,720
selfishness and pride, which is not easy and
something I think we'll all have to face one day on

289
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:44,400
our own deathbeds. It's such a profound arc, like
we talk about the themes in these superhero movies

290
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:50,800
and shows a lot in our reviews, but none of them
quite come as close to the profundity of what dream

291
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:56,600
goes through. His arc literally is the end all be
all arc, I feel like. And it shows what really

292
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,520
matters. That being said, I think I still have the
same criticisms of the story that I did from season

293
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:09,340
one in that Neil Gaiman's rules that he has set up
for this Santa Man universe do still seem

294
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:15,760
arbitrary. Like, oh, the spilling of familial
blood by the antelists will result in their

295
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:24,020
destruction by the kindly ones. It's all very
convenient to his story. You know, to me, like, why

296
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:29,100
couldn't dream just bring his son to live with him
in the dreaming and like give him a new body and even

297
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:36,180
recreate a facsimile of Eurydice and just support
him in that way and decline the boon of killing his

298
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:42,060
only son. It seemed like there were other options
for an all powerful entity like dream. I can answer

299
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:50,640
a few of those questions. I mean, dream is not all
powerful. He has most control in his realm and to be

300
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:57,920
in his realm, one has to be sleeping. Orpheus is
still alive in the waking world and it wouldn't

301
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:04,300
matter if dream created him a new body in the
dreaming because once Orpheus woke up, he would

302
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,780
still be headless in his world. Well, he could put
him into an eternal sleep and then it wouldn't

303
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:14,340
matter. That's fair, but that's still him not
fully taking responsibility for his actions. His

304
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:21,540
son asked to die specifically, not live with him
eternally in the dreaming. I think his son asked to

305
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:27,740
die because his love had died, but if you remove
like his loneliness, I think maybe that desire to

306
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:33,180
die goes away partly. I don't know, man. After
thousands of years as a decapitated head, I think I

307
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:38,060
would want to be done. I think after thousands of
years living as a decapitated head that couldn't

308
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:44,300
move if you gave me the illusion of a body and an
entire realm to explore, I suddenly feel less

309
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,560
shitty. Well, that's not what Orpheus asked of his
father, is it? It doesn't matter because that was

310
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,880
dream's workaround that he could have done. I
think it would have satisfied his arc. I think it

311
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,520
would have satisfied his soul and I think it would
have satisfied his son as well. Again, it comes

312
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:04,200
down to responsibility. He didn't want to have to
leave his son in the care of priests only to be

313
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:10,100
risked, stolen again like he was during the French
Revolution. Who cares if he's stolen? He's an

314
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:15,160
eternal sleep. He's of no use to anybody while he's
in an eternal sleep. You just don't want to accept

315
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,940
the fact that I thought of a better solution for a
dream situation than dream could think of

316
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,520
himself. Well, here's the problem with your
solution. It fails to recognize the fact that

317
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:30,620
dream wanted to die. Well, I guess that was one of
the things that Joanna Constantine posited to

318
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:36,100
him, right? I'm not entirely convinced that was
true though. I mean, he seemed rather reluctant to

319
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:41,600
die by the very end. I mean, he's the one who had
Matthew retrieve his sister's death to begin

320
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,080
with. He was willing to make that sacrifice. Yeah,
but he also asked the kindly ones if there was

321
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:51,980
nothing else that would satisfy them besides his
life. Those were some of his last words. Yeah, and

322
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:57,140
this was already after he had killed his son. Which
I'm saying he didn't have to do, okay? Anyway, we

323
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,780
could go on and on about this. Just know that I'm
right and that this is likely a plot hole in the

324
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:06,060
whole damn story of the Sandman. It is not. You
don't know what you're talking about. You don't

325
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:13,100
understand the characters at all, apparently.
Okay, okay. Read a book! Moving on to Delirium. She

326
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:19,240
was played by Esme Creed Miles. I looked at her
filmography. I have not seen a single thing she's

327
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:24,980
been in, but Delirium was one of my favorite
characters from the Sandman comic series. And her

328
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:31,160
personality is really all over the place, but
always in this haze. So I was curious to see how Esme

329
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:37,020
would approach the character. And while I
expected something a little more absurdist, I

330
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:41,980
guess, I thought she'd perfectly capture
Delirium's innocence and vulnerability while

331
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:48,060
still adding a level of quirkiness that helps
capture the dichotomy of both sanity and insanity

332
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:53,440
that Delirium should have, and I noticed in this
performance that she did. One thing they never

333
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,280
addressed in the course of the show is why she
became Delirium after being delighted for so

334
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:04,140
long. She brings it up, but can you answer that
question? No, because it's actually never been

335
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:10,160
answered in the comics. Oh. Lame, I know they
filmed this scene where it happened, but they cut

336
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:16,480
it from the show. Okay. I think because it's better
off being a mystery. Well, she says she knows

337
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:23,040
things about the endless that no one else knows,
not even Destiny. And it's a really vague line that

338
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:28,020
is left intentionally vague just for the sake of
it. I feel like if they're going to bring it up, they

339
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:32,860
may as well discuss it. It's a Chekhov's gun
situation that never goes off. Well, potentially

340
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:39,320
Delirium is the most powerful of the endless. So
that line was not surprising to me. But again,

341
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:45,460
she's all about mystery. She's insane. So she
probably doesn't even know what she knows or

342
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:52,140
doesn't know. Sure. We do know that Delirium is the
youngest of the endless who used to be delight, but

343
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:58,380
was something of a cosmic afterthought and wasn't
as stable as her siblings. At some point in the

344
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:04,960
past, she had a breakdown and became Delirium.
She's a tragic figure who's dismissed by her

345
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,600
siblings, who see her as naive, unstable, and even
annoying. But behind her erratic speech and

346
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:17,880
fractured behavior is this deep, unwavering
drive. She wants to find her brother destruction

347
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:24,780
and not out of duty or curiosity. But because she
misses him, she remembers what it meant to be whole

348
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:30,880
when she was delight and she wants her family to be
whole again. Dream realizes during the journey

349
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:36,940
that they share that Delirium is not the fool he
thought she was. She's just different. And she

350
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,840
feels everything because she's kind of
everything else. All the cosmic aspects and

351
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:47,080
emotions that her siblings aren't. And Dream
comes to recognize, respect, and even love that

352
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:53,800
about her. He loves her because she's so sincere in
her love in a way that none of the other endless are.

353
00:34:53,800 --> 00:35:00,640
Moving on to destruction, he was played by Barry
Sloan. Now, like Esme Creed Miles, I was not

354
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,080
familiar with Barry Sloan's work prior to this,
but I thought he brought something really

355
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:10,500
grounded and unexpectedly warm to destruction.
Which matches the comic, actually, where

356
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:16,900
destruction, surprisingly, comes across as much
more chipper and less edgier than his siblings.

357
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:23,100
There's still this quiet sadness beneath Sloan's
performance, though, like a man who carries a

358
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:28,760
heavy truth but tries his hardest not to let it
harden him. I would say he's the most human of the

359
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:33,860
endless, and I thought that was easy to see in
Barry's performance. Yeah, it's interesting how

360
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:39,860
the members of the endless that you would assume
would be the darkest and edgiest, like death and

361
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:45,160
destruction, end up being some of the more
human-like characters, whereas some of the more

362
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:51,400
whimsical aspects like Dream and Desire end up
being the more edgy and closed off ones. Yeah, I

363
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:56,820
guess that is true. It kind of circumvents your
expectations in a way. Yeah, I did like the

364
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:01,420
character of destruction. I guess I don't quite
understand how a member of the endless can kind of

365
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,140
give up their responsibilities without
everything just turning to shit, but the

366
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:10,260
characterization of destruction as he was
portrayed here was like very grounded, very

367
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:16,380
level, very understanding. Maybe, yeah, but that
came with the cost as well. Now, Destruction's arc

368
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:22,600
is about the burden of inevitability and the moral
weight of choice. He's the only member of the

369
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:28,220
endless to walk away from his function, which has
changed specifically, though he didn't do it out

370
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:34,720
of neglect, but explicitly out of love. In a
flashback scene to 1675, during a conversation

371
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,700
with Dream, he reveals his growing fear of
mankind's increasing mastery of science and

372
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:47,740
rationality being used not for understanding,
but power and control. He sees the dissected apes,

373
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:53,440
the splitting of light and the probing of nature's
most sacred mysteries with the knowledge of what

374
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,940
it inevitably has always led to, the destruction
of the planet, of those he cares about, and

375
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:05,700
eventually the destruction of everything,
including himself and his family. Rather than

376
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:11,500
bearing responsibility of guiding change in the
universe to that fateful conclusion,

377
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:17,520
Destruction abdicates his cosmic role to let
change happen naturally. But I mean, he's not an

378
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:22,520
arbiter of unnatural change either, so I guess the
fact that everything kind of continues going on

379
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:28,580
without him makes it seem like the function of all
the endless characters is largely unnecessary.

380
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:35,980
Well, no, I think the implication is that he is the
guide of change, and when he abdicated his role,

381
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:39,660
that's essentially when we got the
Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, the Industrial

382
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:45,940
Revolution, like it's kind of speeding up and kind
of going out of control because he's not there to

383
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:52,640
foster it. Well, that's a dick move then. It's like
by leaving his responsibilities, he's just

384
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:56,540
turning his fears into a self-fulfilling
prophecy that much faster. Well, it's going to

385
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:01,000
happen anyway, and he didn't want to be
responsible for that, which is why he just kind of

386
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:07,340
gave up on everything and found his own kind of
peace in that way. He's not bound to this world and

387
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:12,220
its people. He could literally traverse the
universe. Now, when Dream and Delirium find

388
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:19,160
destruction, he challenges the very idea of duty
and identity, reminding Dream that just because

389
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:26,460
someone has a role doesn't mean that it has to be a
prison. Where Dream clings to form and function,

390
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:32,900
Destruction chooses freedom, even if it means
stepping away from the people and realms he loves.

391
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:38,120
Though Dream ultimately doesn't follow
Destruction's advice because he's not willing to

392
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:44,680
sacrifice the ones he loves like Destruction is,
both of them find their own path to peace. And

393
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,620
that's the cost I mentioned earlier, the
destruction of the ones you love. I mean, is it

394
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:54,080
going to happen anyway so that Kostas is going to be
buried regardless? So I'm not sure that's

395
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:59,020
something that he actually has to pay. He feels
responsibility for it is the whole point. He

396
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:05,300
doesn't want to see his loved ones like his family
be destroyed. He'd rather just ignore all of it and

397
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:10,360
ignore it's his bliss essentially with
Destruction. So the cost is lessened. Right,

398
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:16,920
exactly. He's a good guy, but he's not exactly a
good guy. I guess that's a good way to put it. I did

399
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,960
like his wisdom regarding the advice he gave
Daniel at the end when he said that there's no such

400
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:30,820
thing as a one sided coin. Oh yeah. And that each of
the aspects of the endless somewhat define their

401
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:38,300
opposites in that death in her role has come to
define life and despair has come to define hope,

402
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:44,220
desire, hatred and dream, I guess, reality. That
was just an interesting aspect because I've

403
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:50,120
always wondered why those other aspects never
existed as members of the endless. Why was it

404
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:58,720
limited to these D words? I was just about to say, I
was because they don't start with D. But yeah, I

405
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,680
guess in a way those opposite entities are
represented through the existing endless, which

406
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:07,940
I thought was pretty neat. Yeah, he also said
destiny defined freedom. Well, he didn't see what

407
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:14,620
he defined or delirium defined, but if I had to
guess, destruction defines meaning and delirium

408
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:20,640
defines reason. Sounds about right to me. Makes me
wonder what I represent. Taco Bell? But what's the

409
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:32,140
opposite of Taco Bell? Not shitting your pants.
Yeah, you define those two things. Nice. Now, I

410
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:36,820
wanted to touch on these three characters
specifically because they're my favorite of the

411
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:42,260
endless. And I really think the endless are one of
the most interesting aspects of the Sandman

412
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:48,180
series. But there are a lot more characters here,
as I've mentioned, many of whom are static

413
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:54,360
archetypes who don't really grow or have their own
arcs. You could say Dream really is the only one

414
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:59,520
except for maybe Lucifer and I guess Johanna
Constantine and maybe Daniel. But they're really

415
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:11,940
not in the show long enough to touch too much on. So
we'll do that in the story highlights. In a world

416

423
00:41:53,300 --> 00:42:03,880

one was titled Season of Mists. As Dream rebuilds

424
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,480
the dreaming, he is summoned by his brother
Destiny to attend a family gathering of the

425
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:14,740
Endless in Destiny's realm, where a dream meets
his other siblings, death, desire, despair and

426
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:20,280
delirium. As they mentioned their absent brother
who broke off contact with them centuries ago,

427
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,780
Destiny explains that the fates have revealed a
cryptic prophecy to him that would start to unwind

428
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:32,420
with their meeting. Desire aggravates Dream,
reminding him of Nada, a human queen whom he fell in

429
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:38,420
love with millennia ago, but condemned to hell
after she ended the relationship, claiming the

430
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:43,040
Endless and mortals cannot live together after
their affair led to the destruction of her

431
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:49,120
kingdom. After a discussion with death, Dream
resolves to save Nada from hell, making sure to

432
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:55,520
secure the dreaming and meeting with Lightahall
and Hobgadling in case he would not return. As

433
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:01,920
Dream enters hell, Lucifer Morningstar calls on
the demonic legions intent to execute revenge on

434
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:08,160
Dream for the humiliation suffered during their
last confrontation. Now, if the Kindly Ones never

435
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:14,080
visited Destiny, it's likely Dream never would
have died. That is correct. What did the Kindly

436
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:18,340
Ones have against Dream? They're the ones that put
this whole thing into motion. They knew what would

437
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:23,380
happen. Well, so does Destiny. Now, he only knows
what happens. He doesn't see the future. But the

438
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:27,860
Kindly Ones do. And they knew what was going to
happen. So they set in motion what was already

439
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,800
going to happen. You have to think about it fifth
dimensionally. But if they don't set it into

440
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,560
motion, then it likely wouldn't happen. So why
would they have set it into motion unless they

441
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:42,040
wanted Dream to die? Because they're all about
telling stories and they wanted Dream to complete

442
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:47,880
his story. Fucking assholes. I agree. Not a fan of
the Kindly Ones, though I thought they did a

443
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:54,300
fantastic job adapting them in this show. Episode
two was titled The Ruler of Hell. Finding hell

444
00:43:54,300 --> 00:44:00,980
eerily empty upon his arrival, Dream is
confronted by Lucifer, who, weary of her duty, has

445
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:07,020
abdicated the throne and released all souls and
demons to roam other worlds. After Lucifer

446
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:13,680
persuades Dream to ceremoniously cut off her
wings, she gives Dream the key to hell, making him

447
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,580
its custodian in revenge. Returning to the
Dreaming, Dream soon finds a flooded by

448
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:24,220
delegations of supernatural beings seeking
dominion over hell, among them being the gods

449
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:31,360
Susano, Odin, Thor and Loki, a pair from Fairy
named Chloracan and Nala, representatives of

450
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:39,580
both order and chaos, and the demons Azizal,
Corinzon and Merkin, who demand to return to hell.

451
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:46,600
Two angels, Remiel and Yuma, descend from heaven
as observers for God. Dream welcomes everyone in

452
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:53,780
his palace as guests and throws a banquet to watch
all decide who to give the key to hell to. Aside from

453
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:59,600
the Knights entertainment provided by Kanan
Abel, several guests approach Dream with bribes,

454
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:06,020
among them Azizal, who reveals he has captured not
a soul and is willing to exchange it for the key to

455
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:11,860
hell. Now, as I mentioned earlier, one of the
themes of this season is free will, and the

456
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:17,980
abdication of hell by Lucifer, played very well by
Gwendolyn Christie, is sort of the ultimate act of

457
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:24,200
rebellion. She, like death or any of the other
cosmic entities, don't really have free will

458
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:30,560
unless they choose to abandon their role
altogether. She's a great foil for Dream, in that

459
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:35,640
sense, because he struggles to separate his duty
from his identity. It is interesting thinking

460
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:40,260
about all the different ways Neil Gaiman's
version of Lucifer has been adapted throughout

461
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:46,940
various shows and movies over the years. Like this
is the same version of Lucifer that was in the

462
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:53,400
Constantine movie with Keanu Reeves. Yes. And the
one that had his own show on Fox or was it CW? I can't

463
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,240
remember. Maybe it was both the Lucifer show. I
think it even went to Netflix for a time. And I think

464
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:03,940
even in like Good Omens, it's the same character.
And thinking about how this is how it all ends for

465
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:09,080
the character with Lucifer's wings being cut off
by Dream. And then, you know, them going to a beach

466
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:14,500
just to live out the rest of eternity is kind of
fascinating. Well, Lucifer doesn't spend the

467
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:19,080
rest of eternity on the beach. It was just
something she wanted to do at that moment. Gotcha.

468
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:26,060
I did think it was hilarious how inferior the
show's versions of the Nordic gods were compared

469
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:33,360
to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. What? You heard
me. This Thor was a fucking joke compared to Chris

470
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:39,880
Hemsworth. And Chris Hemsworth would kick his
ass. No, this Thor is way more Thor than Marvel's

471
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,820
Thor could ever hope to be. Same with Loki. I don't
know what that means, but you're wrong. He's more

472
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:52,260
true to the mythical character that is Thor. His
hammer was tiny compared to Chris Hemsworth's.

473
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:58,260
Hey, man, it's not about the size of the hammer.
It's how you use it. And he used it well. I did think

474
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:03,680
Odin was cool, though. I thought Loki was cool
throughout this whole series. Was awesome. Yeah,

475
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:09,260
I really like the kind of Billy Idol David Bowie
approach they took to Loki. As much as I love Tom

476
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:14,000
Hiddleston, I think this version of Loki comes
pretty close to his performance. Fuck yeah. When

477
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,780
he set that chick on fire with his cigarette, I was
like, damn. Yeah. Moving on to Episode Three, it

478
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:25,500
was titled More Devils Than Vast Hell Can Hold. In
The Dreaming, Nala runs into Dream and they

479
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:31,620
recount their first meeting. In a flashback to
England in 1593, Dream inspires William

480
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:36,780
Shakespeare to write A Midsummer Night's Dream
and makes him play it for King Oberon, Queen

481
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:42,700
Titania and their court in an attempt to heal a rift
between the Dreaming and Fairy by making mankind

482
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:49,640
forever remember the Fae through the play. Oberon
and Titania like the play and make a bends with

483
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:54,660
Dream. In the present, Dream discusses his
dilemma with Hell's key to Nala. And the next

484
00:47:54,660 --> 00:48:00,220
morning, everyone assembles to hear his
decision. Dream ultimately decides to return the

485
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:06,980
Lordship of Hell to God, provoking Azizal into
attacking him. However, being in the Dreaming,

486
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:13,640
Dream easily overpowers Azizal and saves Nala.
Before his departure, Clericun reveals that Nala

487
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:19,660
is a gift to Dream from Titania, and Dream
reluctantly accepts after Nala herself agrees to

488
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:26,140
stay. Dream finds out that Loki, trying to escape
imprisonment by Odin, swapped appearances with

489
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:32,880
Susano against Susano's will. Dream, in exchange
for a promise of future service, agrees to keep

490
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:39,200
Loki's escape a secret. After meeting with
Lucifer on a beach, Dream and she peacefully part

491
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:45,880
ways and later, Dream apologizes to Dada. She does
not accept his apology, however, and leaves for

492
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:52,680
the waking world instead. So this episode had the
adaptation of the Midsummer Night's Dream issue

493
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:57,740
in the comic book, which ended up winning a World
Fantasy Award. So I was really expecting a lot from

494
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:02,880
this episode. And I guess the whole play within a
play aspect was surprising to me because I thought

495
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,280
it would go deeper into that story of Shakespeare.
But you know, that whole thing really isn't

496
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:12,340
relevant to the story of Dream. So I guess that's
why it was left out. Well, the play within a story

497
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:17,020
played out just like it did in the comics. It was
actually a pretty faithful adaptation. Like

498
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:23,040
where you had Robin Goodfellow take on the role of
Puck within the play. Yes, I got to say that King

499
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:28,620
Joffrey, I don't know the actor's name. Jack
Gleason, he fucking nailed it in the role of Puck.

500
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:36,960
Oh, dude. Yeah. The combo of Freddy Fox as Loki and
Jack Gleason as Puck was so perfect. So perfect.

501
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,720
Yeah, they could get a whole series on their own. It
wouldn't be a really fucked up series. But yeah,

502
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:48,560
they're a good duo. Absolutely. Episode four was
titled Brief Lives. Delirium unexpectedly pays a

503
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:54,220
visit to Dream, seeking his help in finding their
absent brother, Destruction. Reluctant at

504
00:49:54,220 --> 00:50:00,280
first, Dream agrees, secretly hoping to
encounter Nada on Earth instead of his brother.

505
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:06,340
Destruction is seen engaging in painting and
poetry accompanied by Barnabas, a talking dog on a

506
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:12,700
remote island. Dream and Delirium enlist Wanda, a
chauffeur of Dream's old friend, to help them

507
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:18,680
track down Destruction's contacts. The first of
them, however, dies just before they find him. And

508
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:24,540
Dream grows suspicious that an unknown force is
preventing them from finding Destruction. Next,

509
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:30,960
they seek Ishtar, an old Babylonian deity and
Destruction's former lover who, depowered

510
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:37,620
without worship, works as a club dancer. After a
heated discussion with Dream, Ishtar performs a

511
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:43,500
mesmerizing dance for her audience, causing an
explosion that kills everyone in the club,

512
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:49,660
including Ishtar and Wanda. Desire appears
revealing to the naive Delirium that Dream has

513
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:55,560
been lying to her, causing Delirium to leave her
siblings in anger. Dude, Madonna was in this

514
00:50:55,560 --> 00:51:01,440
episode. Yeah, from the Punisher. I noticed that.
That's crazy. I was like, hey, what are you doing up

515
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,940
on the stage? Get down there and go solve a crime or
something. She was such a good detective in the

516
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:11,320
Punisher series. It's just, I guess, surprising
to see sometimes actors and other roles. She was

517
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:19,380
also a fantastic Ishtar, though. I can believe
that. Was the whole like Wanda trans issue in this

518
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:24,840
episode also in the comic book? It was, but not in
this volume. Wanda is actually a character that

519
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:30,860
was borrowed from Volume 5, which was not adapted.
It's titled A Game of You. I don't know if you

520
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:36,460
remember Barbie from season one, where she has
these dreams that she's like in this fantasy

521
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:41,500
world. She was one of Rose's and Light's roommates
in Florida when she was searching for Jed. Oh,

522
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:46,040
yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, I do remember. Yes. So in A
Game of You, Barbie is actually the main

523
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:52,360
character. Dream hardly ever shows up in that
volume. And Wanda is Barbie's friend. I think

524
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:58,460
she's a really popular character from that
volume. So they adapted her into this episode. Oh,

525
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:03,600
interesting. OK, that's like surprisingly
progressive for a series that came out in the 80s. I

526
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:08,180
think I was just surprised by that wondering if it
was something they just threw in to address

527
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:13,280
current trans issues or if it had always been
there. It was played a little differently here. I

528
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,680
wouldn't say that in the comic in the 80s, they were
addressing trans issues. It was just a trans

529
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:24,540
character that happened to be in the story.
Gotcha. OK. Moving on to episode five, the song of

530
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:30,080
Orpheus. After recalling when destruction tried
to tell him why he's abandoning his duty, Dream

531
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:35,580
attends Wanda's funeral, where death persuades
him to make amends with delirium. Dream enters

532
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:41,760
delirium's realm and eventually reconnects with
her, resuming their quest to locate destruction.

533
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:48,640
They seek advice from destiny. He tells Dream that
only his son, an oracle of endless blood, can help

534
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:55,980
them. In a flashback to Greece, 1700 BC, the
endless attend the wedding of Orpheus, son of

535
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:02,580
Dream and Calliope. That night, however,
Orpheus's wife, Eurydice, dies from a snake bite.

536
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:08,400
Orpheus begs Dream to help him retrieve Eurydice
from the underworld, but he refuses. With

537
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:14,100
destruction's help, Orpheus then approaches
death and she reluctantly makes him immortal,

538
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:19,400
allowing him to travel to the underworld. Once
there, Orpheus persuades Hades and Persephone

539
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:26,360
via song to revive Eurydice. But then he fails the
test of faith presented to him, leaving Eurydice

540
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:33,100
to stay dead. Against the caution of Calliope, the
desperate Orpheus lets himself be torn apart by

541
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:40,280
the Menads, murderous worshipers of Dionysus.
Left to live as a decapitated head, Orpheus begs

542
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:46,860
Dream to kill him to no avail. In the present, a
distraught Dream and delirium depart to see

543
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:53,040
Orpheus. This is my favorite episode of this
season. I thought it was a tremendous visual

544
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:58,740
telling of the story of Orpheus and Eurydice. Oh,
yeah, that's a classic Greek myth. And I agree, it

545
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:04,460
was very cool to see played out in live action. They
never addressed the fact that Desire was behind

546
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:09,880
Eurydice's death, though. Right. I'm glad you
mentioned that. I thought they would as well,

547
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:16,240
maybe during the wake or maybe even during this
episode. But yes, in the comics and I think in the

548
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:24,960
myth as well, Desire influences a Sader to chase
Eurydice, just lust filled. And in that chase is

549
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:30,580
when she is bitten by the snake. They didn't have
the Sader in this. They just went with the snake.

550
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:35,620
But I almost feel like that's doing a disservice to
the story because Desire really is the ultimate

551
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:42,080
villain, I feel, of the story. So I'm not sure why
they decided to downplay that. Yeah, they kind of

552
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:47,220
gave Desire a pass by the end. But yeah, they're
definitely the main villain. It was cool to see the

553
00:54:47,220 --> 00:54:52,000
same actress playing Calliope as the first
season. Oh, yeah, for the bonus episode that was in

554
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:58,300
season one. Yeah, she's a great Calliope. The
entire cast is so damn good. Minus Rose, but we

555
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:03,240
didn't get much of her this season. And even what we
did get, she was much better. Yeah, I would agree.

556
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:09,780
Moving on to episode six, which was titled Family
Blood in a flashback to 1794. Dream approaches

557
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:15,260
Lady Johanna Constantine with a task to retrieve
Orpheus's head from France during the Revolution

558
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:21,500
and return it to a temple in Greece, where it would
be safeguarded by priests hunted down by a

559
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:27,020
Maximilian Robespierre. And as men Constantine
succeeds with the help of Orpheus himself, whose

560
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:33,320
song incites the end to Robespierre's tyranny.
After returning Orpheus's head to his temple,

561
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:38,960
Constantine asks Dream for a chance to visit
Orpheus and the present dream in Delirium past her

562
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:44,600
grave near Orpheus's temple. Their dream
reunites with Orpheus and he discloses the

563
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:50,100
location of destruction. Dream and Delirium
approach destruction who reluctantly welcomes

564
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:54,880
them. The three discussed destruction's
departure from his duties and his wards against

565
00:55:54,880 --> 00:56:00,680
being found to be the cause of the deaths of Wanda,
Ishtar and others. He alludes that mortals are

566
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:05,980
capable of great destruction on their own without
the need of him being complicit. Despite

567
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:12,780
Delirium's plea, destruction bids them farewell
and parts advice to Dream and gives Barnabas to

568
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:18,160
Delirium to keep her company. With that, he
disappears into the sky. Dream and Orpheus

569
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:24,600
reconcile and upon Orpheus's request, Dream ends
his son's life. Elsewhere, the kindly ones

570
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:31,680
condemn Dream for spilling family blood. I really
like the way that the story incorporates actual

571
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:37,480
history, in this case, the French Revolution and
how you had Robespierre who during the French

572
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:43,180
Revolution tried to bring out an age of reason to do
away with religion, basically, and just

573
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:48,840
acknowledge like a supreme being that everyone in
the country would accept. And that kind of plays

574
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:55,480
out in his statement to Constantine when he's
like, there are no gods. There's just France and

575
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:59,360
the state. And she had that badass line where she's
holding the head and she's like, there's so much

576
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:05,140
more than that when the head starts sinking, you
know, given her knowledge of all of the endless and

577
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:10,320
all the supernatural and mysticism that
surrounds the world within the story. I thought

578
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:16,040
that was a really cool moment. Yeah. And some of the
volumes that were not adapted, like they also go

579
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:23,320
into the history of ancient Greece and history of
ancient Greece and Baghdad and stuff like that.

580
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:29,080
Again, the story of Sandman is not bound by any
location or time, which not only makes it great,

581
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:35,540
but again, very unique amongst literature.
Moving on to Episode Seven, which was titled Time

582
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:41,540
and Night. Dream asks Destiny's help to protect
him, but Destiny reveals there is nothing he can

583
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:47,660
do. Dream visits the kindly ones to give them an
explanation, but they too are bound by law and

584
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:53,780
cannot help him. Dream then visits Loki and Puck,
now a couple, who are pretending to be the Pope and

585
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:59,480
Cardinal. Dream calls in his favor for saving
Loki, though Puck later suggests privately to

586
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:05,940
Loki to do what Dream wants, but not when Dream
wants it to be done, thereby causing more chaos.

587
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:10,920
After returning to the Dreaming, Dream reveals
that Lightahall's son, Daniel, will be his

588
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:17,140
successor. Dream visits his father, Time, but
Time reveals he is powerless to help Dream, though

589
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:23,240
Dream tells him he loves him. He next visits his
mother, Knight, who asks Dream to live with her,

590
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:29,420
but he rejects her offer. Back in the Dreaming,
Clarke returns to bring back Nala at Titania's

591
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:35,640
orders, since she has heard that Dream could die
and doesn't want Nala hurt. Though Nala resists,

592
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:40,580
Dream persuades her to go back to fairy for safety
before leaving. He gives her a necklace as a

593
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:45,940
parting gift, which will summon him any time she
calls out to him, at which time he will offer her a

594
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:52,180
boon. Meanwhile, Lightah and Rose visit Unity's
home in London, where a disguised Puck works as the

595
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:57,900
chauffeur. That night when Rose and Lightah go to
dinner, Puck puts everyone at their home to sleep

596
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:03,540
before kidnapping Daniel and taking him to Loki.
Now, I thought it was really cool that they showed

597
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:10,080
Time and Knight in this episode because we don't
actually see Time, if I remember, in the comic

598
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:16,480
series. He's in one of the over-itchers, but not
this volume. So this whole journey he takes to meet

599
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:22,820
his parents is original to the story. Well, we get
to see Knight in the original 10 volumes, but not

600
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:28,660
Time. So, yeah, that was original and that was
great, I thought. It was fantastic. And it spoke a

601
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:36,300
lot to Dream's arc as well in terms of maybe how he
came to be the way he was and how he was really

602
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:43,620
growing emotionally as this abstract deity. The
actor who played his father, Rufus Sule, just did a

603
00:59:43,620 --> 00:59:49,480
fantastic job with that performance. Honestly, I
think this whole scene is just a master class in

604
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:54,840
acting. Now, he's the most recognizable actor, I
think, out of the entire series. It was really an

605
00:59:54,840 --> 01:00:02,020
interesting piece of casting to have like the head
honcho, all-powerful father of the endless being

606
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:08,580
actor of note. Episode eight was titled Fuel for
the Fire. Nala and Clericon return to the fairy

607
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:14,680
realm where Queen Titania jealously takes notice
of Nala's necklace. While contemplating his fate

608
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:20,920
in his throne room, Dream inadvertently ends up in
the realm of a sister despair where he sees through

609
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:26,520
one of her mirrors the light it also despairs over
her missing baby, Daniel. And Dream learns that

610
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:31,420
Loki and Puck have framed him for Daniel's
disappearance while posing as police

611
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:37,620
detectives. Despite Lucian discovering that the
kindly ones cannot harm Dream in his own realm,

612
01:00:37,620 --> 01:00:42,240
Dream enters the waking world to enlist the
present day, Johanna Constantine, to find

613
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:47,900
Daniel. When the two of them visit Lighta, Dream
encounters Alex Burgess, the son of the man who

614
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:54,000
imprisoned him for over 100 years and whom Dream
cursed with a lifelong sleep. After seeing

615
01:00:54,000 --> 01:01:00,040
Dream's antagonism toward Lighta and Alex,
Johanna begins to suspect Dream of wanting to die

616
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:05,560
and suggests he return to the dreaming.
Meanwhile, Puck flees from Loki with the baby

617
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:11,340
Daniel, having grown fond of the child and fearing
Loki's plans for him. Dream shares a final drink

618
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:17,380
with Hobgadling. And after speaking of regrets,
Dream awakens Alex from his sleep. Posing his

619
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:24,460
dream, Loki tricks Puck into returning to him with
Daniel, whom Loki then sets on fire in a fireplace

620
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:30,800
before showing photos to Lighta of her burned dead
son. Dream recreates the Corinthian, a nightmare

621
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:35,780
who once tried to kill him to aid Johanna. What did
you think of the actress who played Johanna

622
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:42,540
Constantine's performance this season compared
to last? Jenna Coleman? I thought she crushed it.

623
01:01:42,540 --> 01:01:48,180
100 percent. Johanna has a really interesting arc
this season. It's a romantic one. You know, she

624
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:53,560
starts out traumatized by the deaths of those she
loved as we saw happen in season one. And she's even

625
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:59,460
like subconsciously killing lovers in her dreams
as an expression for how averse she is to the notion

626
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:05,060
of love. But the Corinthian proves to be too
charming, which is not necessarily in contrast to

627
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:10,580
his depiction in season one. But it is still kind of
weird and terrifying how she seems to fall for him,

628
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:16,180
I think. Yeah, considering that Johanna is a
gender bent version of John Constantine in this

629
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:20,840
show, I'm assuming that this arc is largely
original to her character. No, she shouldn't have

630
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:26,000
even been in the season. But Jenna Coleman, again,
just crushed the role in the first one. So I'm sure

631
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:31,000
they figured they had to bring her back. And I'm
glad they did. Got you. Another thing they rewrote

632
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:37,380
for this season was having dream end up in the realm
of despair, which was a brief little scene. But I

633
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:42,560
thought worked really well. Oh, yeah, that was a
brilliant moment. It was terrifying when Loki put

634
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:47,340
the baby on the fire. I was like, damn, is that how it
happened in the books? Yeah, that's another

635
01:02:47,340 --> 01:02:52,500
fucked up moment. Yeah, it definitely was. Makes
me sad because, like, you know, the kids essence

636
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:59,140
didn't die, but his mortal form did die. Yeah,
really sad. Moving on to episode nine, the kindly

637
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:04,640
ones. When Johanna protests working with the
Corinthian, Dream gives her a necklace capable of

638
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:11,340
uncreating him if she wishes. When Daniel's nanny
suspects Loki is lying about the baby, he kills her

639
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:17,900
in a secluded alley. Well, Delirium meets with
Destiny seeking aid to find the lost Bernard and

640
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:22,420
realizing there are currently multiple
destinies. Dream meets with Fiddler's Green and

641
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:27,940
discusses how Dream has changed. Loki,
meanwhile, reveals to Puck how he changed Daniel

642
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:34,080
from a mere mortal into a deity by burning away his
human body, allowing him to take on Dream's powers

643
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:39,360
should the need arise. While also framing Dream so
that Lighta will invoke the kindly ones

644
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:45,660
vengeance. Matt Heddy, an agent of the kindly
ones, helps Lighta to do so. While the Corinthian

645
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:50,680
and Johanna track down Loki to his hotel, where
Puck gives them the key to their room before

646
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:56,460
returning to Ferry. The two rescue Daniel, while
Odin and Thor, who followed Johanna, capture

647
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:02,840
Loki. After Dream gives Delirium Goldie to help
find Bernard, the kindly ones convince Lighta to

648
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:08,180
become their avatar of fury and vengeance in
response to Dream killing Orpheus and, as she

649
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:13,500
believes, her son. When Nala learns that Queen
Titania stole her necklace, she's unable to

650
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:18,620
retrieve it before Titania summons Dream,
removing him from his realm just as Lighta and the

651
01:04:18,620 --> 01:04:23,740
kindly ones appear there and kill Fiddler's
Green. I wonder what the point of showing multiple

652
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:30,060
destinies was. It kind of gave the illusion that
another outcome was possible, even though there

653
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:36,800
was no alternate outcome. I think it was to give the
viewers hope as well as Dream hope. And I think

654
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:42,620
there were other outcomes possible if Loki had not
done what he did. Interesting. It was actually a

655
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:48,240
brilliant plan on Loki's behalf. He really
couldn't have screwed Dream over better. There's

656
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:54,360
a few things that I think the show does better than
the comic. But one of the things they really kind of

657
01:04:54,360 --> 01:05:01,380
messed up on was ruining the surprise that Daniel
was going to be the new Dream, because we didn't

658
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:06,580
know that was going to happen in the comic until it
actually happened. Really? Yeah. So what was

659
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:11,620
Dream's preoccupation with the child in the books
then? Well, in the books, it's not revealed until

660
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:19,040
later what favor he asked of Loki. So at the time you
didn't know that he asked Loki to kidnap Daniel.

661
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:23,600
You just assumed that Loki kidnapped Daniel just
to do it. Gotcha. That actually would have been a

662
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:29,140
cool reveal, I think. Yeah, and I don't really
understand why they spoiled it, other than maybe

663
01:05:29,140 --> 01:05:34,440
it would have left audiences questioning what was
going on and why we were watching this kind of

664
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:39,900
tangential thing going on with Daniel. I do think
it's really cool. And I thought this in the comics

665
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:46,380
as well that Fury Lighthaul, who is Wonder Woman
and Steve Trevor's daughter in the comics, works

666
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:51,540
with the Furies to take out Sandman. That was cool.
That was a nice little clawback, although she

667
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:57,340
wasn't a great character. I don't know if I bought
her wrath as much as I probably should have. There

668
01:05:57,340 --> 01:06:04,100
was a lot left out regarding her story for this
adaptation, which I kind of wish was still there,

669
01:06:04,100 --> 01:06:10,000
but it made it more believable in the comic when she
became the avatar of the kindly ones. Again, still

670
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:17,060
well done here, just not as well done as the books.
So Lightha is the daughter of the Golden Age,

671
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:22,380
Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor. And I'm guessing
that they named her after Diana's mother,

672
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:26,500
Hippolyta, right? Yes, that's correct. The
actress would have made a pretty decent Wonder

673
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:33,520
Woman, I think. Yeah, I agree. Moving on to Episode
10, Long Live the King. As Lightha continues to

674
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:39,860
kill denizens of the dreaming, Nala uses her boon
to send Dream back to his realm, where he reveals to

675
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:45,480
Lightha that Daniel is still alive and is able to
temporarily free her from the kindly ones

676
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:52,340
influence. When Dream attempts to kill Lightha in
the waking world, Matt Heddy convinces him not to.

677
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:57,700
Deciding to confront the kindly ones at the edge of
the dreaming, Dream prepares Daniel to take his

678
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:04,000
place and his staff for his potential end, sending
them away, though Matthew the Raven travels with

679
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:09,020
him. When the kindly ones inform him that Lightha
is back in the dreaming, destroying his palace

680
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:14,540
where his staff, including Lucien, Kane, the
Corinthian and Daniel are sheltering, Dream

681
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:20,060
sends Matthew to bring him his sister, Death, who
is waiting at the palace as well. When Nala

682
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:25,780
confronts Queen Titania regarding her returning
to the dreaming, Titania gives Nala her sword,

683
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:30,680
which Nala uses to kill Light as Avatar in the
dreaming, just as Dream admits after a

684
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:36,860
conversation with his sister that he's ready to
die to protect his loved ones and Death takes him.

685
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:42,380
It's then that Delirium finds that Bernard was
with Matt Heddy, who herself finds Lighta awake

686
01:07:42,380 --> 01:07:47,420
and reveals that Dream is dead. As the Corinthian
and the others in the palace wonder what has

687
01:07:47,420 --> 01:07:55,160
happened, Daniel reveals himself, aged and
transformed as the new Dream of the Endless. Now, I

688
01:07:55,160 --> 01:08:01,520
remember when I was reading the comics, I expected
this epic battle between the kindly ones and

689
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:09,340
Sandman. And it was shocking to me that his life
ended with this anti-climactic whimper, but his

690
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:15,040
death is much more human, I guess you could say,
which is fitting for the character who, as you

691
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:21,260
mentioned, is like a god who over time changes to
become more human. I was under the impression that

692
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:25,960
Lighta understood what was going on, that her son
was still alive and had retreated from attacking

693
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:31,319
the dreaming. I guess I don't understand why she
went back to doing it just suddenly. Yeah, that

694
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:37,100
whole part was pretty rushed, but essentially the
kindly ones just influenced her again to go back

695
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:45,140
and finish the job. Interesting. Now, Dream died
just as Nala decapitated Lighta. If he had waited

696
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:52,160
like 10 more seconds, could he have like delayed
his death? You think? Yes. That's too bad. It's

697
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:57,439
part of the tragedy. Really, Titania is to blame
for all of this. Yes, Titania. She is the true

698
01:08:57,439 --> 01:09:03,000
villain of the story. There you go. Or at least one
of many. We've gone to episode 11, a tale of

699
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:08,819
graceful ends as Lucian, Nala, Matthew and the
Corinthian prepare for dreams funeral. Kane

700
01:09:08,819 --> 01:09:15,840
demands Daniel resurrect Abel, whom Lighta
killed. Daniel as Dream obliges as guests arrive

701
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:21,760
for the wake, including Johanna Constantine,
Hobgadling, Alex Burgess, Nada, as well as the

702
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:27,520
court of fairy and deities from various
pantheons, questions abound regarding Daniel,

703
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:32,479
who takes it upon himself to recreate other
various dream entities that Lighta killed,

704
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:38,600
including Murph Pumpkinhead and Fiddler's
Green, though the latter requests to remain dead,

705
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:44,819
along with the prior dream, as their deaths had
meaning. The rest of the endless arrive save for

706
01:09:44,819 --> 01:09:50,800
destruction, who shows up later in secret to speak
with Daniel, offering advice and insights.

707
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:57,160
Destiny, desire, despair, delirium, death and
Lucian take turns speaking at Dream's wake before

708
01:09:57,160 --> 01:10:03,360
his body is sent to drift on a cosmic river of stars.
While Hobbes speaks with death and Johanna and

709
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:09,280
Corinthian express feelings for one another,
Lighta reunites with her son Daniel, now Dream,

710
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:14,640
who chooses not to punish her for her role in his
predecessor's death. Daniel then makes Lucian

711
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:20,040
the Dreaming's Prime Minister before meeting
with Hobb and recalling Dream sharing a drink with

712
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:26,340
William Shakespeare after his completion of The
Tempest. Finally, Daniel meets his new family,

713
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:32,320
the Endless, who welcome him as the new Dream. In a
post-credits scene, the kindly ones equate

714
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:38,020
storytelling to yarn work and read a poetic
fortune about life and rebirth from a fortune

715
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:45,640
cookie. This episode dragged. It felt really like
an epilogue that didn't need to be. And so I think

716
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:52,960
just felt too long to me. I could see that. I kind of
felt the same way when reading The Wake, which is

717
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:58,880
its own volume of comics when I read the series. But
I also have to admit that there's something very

718
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:06,560
bittersweet and unique about it and that we don't
really get something like this in other stories,

719
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:11,320
something where we really get to celebrate not
only the main character of the story we just read,

720
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:18,140
but Shed's new light on how various characters
truly saw Dream. I will totally admit that I got

721
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:23,600
choked up when I saw Dream's boat kind of turning
into a shooting star because it reminded me

722
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:32,200
exactly of when I read the comic. How bittersweet
everything was in celebrating what I had read and

723
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:39,180
being given that time to grieve and mourn in a way.
Seeing Daniel from the outset be very much

724
01:11:39,180 --> 01:11:43,960
everything that Dream could not be for most of his
existence, like forgiving, humble, nurturing

725
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:50,820
was also important, I think, for audiences to see.
You know, he's innocent and unsure of himself. But

726
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:57,500
Jacob Anderson gives a fantastic performance as a
grown Daniel of someone trying to mimic Tom

727
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:02,700
Sturridge's dream, but still making it his own.
Are you familiar with William Shakespeare's The

728
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:09,100
Tempest at all? No, I never read it, but it sounds
like it's the story of a God choosing to be mortal.

729
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:16,140
Of a sorcerer choosing to be mortal, yes, who is in
charge of his own realm, which is an island and

730
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:21,400
essentially choosing to forgive people, all of
his enemies. It was William Shakespeare's last

731
01:12:21,400 --> 01:12:27,180
play that he wrote. And actually, in the comics,
the last issue of the main Sandman story revolves

732
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:32,940
all around William Shakespeare. Like it's not the
kindly ones who are the final panel. It's

733
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:38,320
Shakespeare. So I'm really glad that they found a
way to work that into this episode as well, because

734
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:44,100
I didn't think they were going to. Moving on to the
bonus episode, episode 12, Death, The High Cost of

735
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:49,760
Living, a young disillusioned journalist named
Sexton Fernival, where it's a suicide note to his

736
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:54,800
ex-girlfriend Sylvie before being interrupted
by his roommates and her girlfriend, leaving

737
01:12:54,800 --> 01:13:00,120
their apartment so they could be alone. Sexton
meets death at a trash heap in the city, and death

738
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:06,700
suggests he come to her apartment so she can mend
his shirt, which tore when he fell in the trash.

739
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:12,760
Upon learning who she is and that today is her one
day out of every 100 years that she gets to spend as a

740
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:18,560
mortal human, Sexton attempts to leave, but is
captured and threatened by Mad Heddy, who asks

741
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:23,780
death to find her soul. Reluctantly, Sexton
agrees to follow death as she attempts to

742
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:29,500
experience as much as she can in one day. After
arriving at a dance club where he used to go with

743
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:35,000
Sylvie, Sexton meets his roommate there along
with her girlfriend, and he's introduced to

744
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:40,100
Jackie, who appears fond of him, though he's
preoccupied with the possibility of running into

745
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:46,500
Sylvie while getting a drink at the bar, the House
DJ and Club promoter Theo notices death's onk

746
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:53,040
necklace and manages to lure both her and Sexton
into a trap upstairs, where death realizes Theo

747
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:59,080
summoned death using an occult ritual in an effort
to resurrect his recently deceased girlfriend,

748
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:05,000
Natalie. Theo is injured while threatening the
two, and Sexton calls an ambulance for him. After

749
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:10,900
the sun rises, death buys a pendant, which she
gives to Sexton before she expresses how great it

750
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:17,440
is to be alive before suffering a fatal heart
attack at the end of her 24 hours. Mad Heddy appears

751
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:23,740
and Sexton learns the pendant contains a photo of
Mad Heddy's daughter from long ago, her soul. Back

752
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:29,640
at his apartment, Sexton deletes his suicide note
to Sylvie before Jackie arrives and he offers her

753
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:35,420
some tea. Now, I'm not entirely sure that this
episode needed to be adapted. I'm not actually

754
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:42,420
familiar with the comic that this adapts. I've
never read it, but it truly did feel supplemental.

755
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:46,840
Like it wasn't really necessary. Not in the same
way that the first season's episodes, I thought,

756
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:51,820
were a little bit more necessary. Maybe not the cat
one, but definitely Calliope. Yeah, this one felt

757
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:56,080
more interesting to me than the cat story from the
first season. It was really just kind of like a

758
01:14:56,080 --> 01:15:01,960
celebration of life, I guess, the whole episode.
And I thought the performances were really solid.

759
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:06,740
Oh, yeah. Yeah, definitely. So overall, I enjoyed
it. Like I didn't regret watching it like I did the

760
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:11,680
cat one. Like I remember watching the cow one and
just being like, I want to be done with the show

761
01:15:11,680 --> 01:15:16,680
already. I actually kind of liked the cow one, but I
also just liked that story in the comics. My

762
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:21,140
impression that time was like, you don't have to
adapt everything. I think they took that message

763
01:15:21,140 --> 01:15:26,240
to heart with this second season. Thankfully,
perhaps. Yeah. Honestly, I would not mind more

764
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:33,380
bonus episodes. Like if you give me a season three,
just of just nothing but anthological shorts or

765
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:39,780
maybe some of the overture tales, stuff like that.
It's probably not going to happen, but I wish that

766
01:15:39,780 --> 01:15:45,840
it would because now that Dead Boy Detectives we
know is for sure not moving forward. It feels just

767
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:52,080
like, well, this is it now. And that makes me sad
because I love Sandman. Yeah, I forgot that Dead

768
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:57,700
Boy Detectives was in the same universe. And I kind
of missed seeing those guys in this season because

769
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:01,120
I was hoping we would get a chance to. Yeah,
actually, I thought we were going to see them in

770
01:16:01,120 --> 01:16:05,320
episode two, because one thing that's not
addressed in the season is that when Lucifer

771
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:12,440
empties hell, basically all of the evil people who
were there show up in the real world as like zombie

772
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:20,060
ghosts. And that's actually how Charles dies is
some zombie ghost bullies kill him. Oh, OK.

773
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:25,540
Interesting. Fascinating. So when the angels
take back control of hell, all of them get sent back

774
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:31,160
there and it kind of saves the world in a way. Yeah,
that was kind of a loose thread. Yeah, probably not

775
01:16:31,160 --> 01:16:36,920
needed for this season. But what would have been a
great season to have Dead Boy Detectives? Yeah, it

776
01:16:36,920 --> 01:16:40,980
would have been. Yeah, that would have been great.
But back to this show and this season, again, I'm

777
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:46,780
sad that it's over. It was a focused adaptation
that masterfully threads themes of love, growth

778
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:53,480
and mortality into a bittersweet and profoundly
existential tapestry. Again, it's a master work

779
01:16:53,480 --> 01:17:01,500
adaptation, in my opinion. And I'm giving it five
out of five stars, a fresh rating on Ron Tomatoes.

780
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:06,340
Damn, you didn't even give the first season five
out of five stars. No, because the first season was

781
01:17:06,340 --> 01:17:12,060
really just an introduction to this world. But I
think this season, again, did a really good job of

782
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:18,000
weaving together all the different threads to
really capture the essence of the themes and the

783
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:23,140
story of the comic, which is a story that I feel
should be adapted for other mediums, because the

784
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:28,880
more people that get to experience it, the better.
It's a worthwhile story, for sure. I'll agree with

785
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:33,580
your rating. I think I would probably have gone
4.5, but I can absolutely see the case made for

786
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:39,040
five, considering how transcendental and just
well written the story is, not only in the comic

787
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:45,220
books, but how it's adapted here. I don't think I
can recommend it anymore than I already do. So five

788
01:17:45,220 --> 01:17:50,500
stars, then. Nice. I'm really glad you liked it. I
really hoped you would. I hope everyone likes it as

789
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:56,980
much as I do. I know a lot of critics don't because I
don't know why they're just petty as fuck,

790
01:17:56,980 --> 01:18:00,500
probably because this season doesn't stand as
well on its own without seeing season one, maybe

791
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:06,500
either that or they're just like comic purists or
they never read the comic. I don't know. They're

792
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:12,140
weird. I'm right. They're wrong. This show is
awesome. And hopefully if you made it this far,

793
01:18:12,140 --> 01:18:17,700
you've already seen it and already know that. But
that does it for this review. A.J .9K help close us

character, Star Sapphire and Ironheart, who

801
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:05,040
recently had her own Disney Plus television
series. Yeah, this is sort of a late time coming tie

dookie, doink, derp, a dumpy, dibble, the third.
