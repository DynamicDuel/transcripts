00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,220
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi, welcome to
the DynaMic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,300
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:39,420
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin

4
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,080
brother, Marvelous Joe. And there are only four
episodes left of the weekly show of DynaMic Duel

5
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:52,420
after this one, which will be a team duel, our final
Christmas duel in which we're going all out by

6
00:00:52,420 --> 00:01:00,220
pitting the Legion of Super-Pets against the Pet
Avengers. It is the pet duel to end all pet duels.

7
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:06,620
Yeah, typically, for the most part, around
Christmas time, the show does a silly animal duel

8
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,720
and this is like the ultimate version of that.
Yeah, I think there were only two years where we

9
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:17,300
didn't do like pet heroes. That was Alfred versus
Jarvis and Keelix versus Herbie. But those are

10
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,080
like robot pets. Yeah, exactly. It still counts.
But we're going to tell you about each team's

11
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,560
backstories before running the stats and finding
out which team would win before that we're not

12
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,880
going to break down the comic book movie news
because we're recording this episode early and

13
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,520
there isn't any yet. Yeah, we're recording it
early due to the upcoming holiday break. This

14
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,220
episode will drop just a few days before
Christmas, so we just want to wish everyone a happy

15
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,920
holiday. As always, we list our segment times in
our episode description, so feel free to check out

16
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,380
the show notes if you want to skip ahead to a
particular topic. Our artificially intelligent

17
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:56,280
duel simulator, AJ9K, has a quick message for our
listeners, so listen up. Hello, these are the

Podcast Network this week, including the Konsole

29
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,020
Kombat podcast, where hosts John and Dean
simulate battles between popular video game

30
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:06,320
characters. In yesterday's episode, they found
out who'd win between Pac-Man and Yoshi. Over on

31
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,940
the Max Destruction podcast, hosts Scotty and
Gilly pet your favorite action heroes from film

32
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,760
and television against each other. On Wednesday,
the Macho Twins are learning who would win in a

33
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,900
fight between Santa Claus from Violence Night and
Krampus. That's going to be a really good one. I'm

34
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,160
looking forward to that one. On the Senjoh World
podcast, hosts Zachary Hepburn speculates on

35
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,620
fights between fan favorite anime and manga
characters. In his next episode, Zach's

36
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:36,620
revealing who'd win between Shigyo Kageyama, aka
Mob from Mob Psycho 100, and Tatsumaki the tornado

37
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:42,060
of terror from One Punch Man. Visit

38
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,280
notes to listen to all of the shows in the DynaMic
Podcast Network. And now that that's done, quick

39
00:03:48,280 --> 00:04:01,820
to the main event! Alright, now let's find out who
is going to win in the ultimate pet team duel

40
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:24,560
matchup of the Legion of Super Pets against the pet
Avengers. Okay, the Legion of Super Pets versus

41
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:31,340
the pet Avengers. Of course, you may also know the
Legion of Super Pets as the League of Super Pets

42
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,440
because they had a film with that title a few years
ago. Oh yeah, that's right. Yeah, they weren't

43
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:41,100
called the Legion, they were called the League.
I'm assuming to tie them into the Justice League.

44
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,200
Why are they called the Legion of Super Pets in the
comics? Because the Legion of Super Heroes were

45
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:51,560
the ones that assembled the team initially. Oh,
oh, interesting. Okay. Yeah, the pet Avengers

46
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:58,320
have not had their own movie, nor is one slated, but
a few of the people on my roster have appeared in

47
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,200
films, including Throg. He was like an Easter egg
in the Loki show. Lockjaw, of course, was in the

48
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:10,740
God-awful in humans television series. Lockheed
played a really cool part in the New Mutants movie.

49
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,720
Oh, that's right. And of course, Cosmo was in the
Guardians of the Galaxy film, the third one. And I

50
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:21,020
guess Cosmo has been the most prominent pet
Avenger on your team in terms of like on-screen

51
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,420
media. Right. So not a bad showing for the pet
Avengers. I did really like the League of Super

52
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,540
Pets movie that they put out, though. I liked it
more than I wanted to. We reviewed that film a

53
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:37,360
couple of years ago. Well, the Super Pets have also
had a cartoon starring Krypto and Ace. So they're

54
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,800
just better, like all around, you know? Everyone
knows them. They're really popular, really cool.

55
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,020
It's so sad that most of them are going to be going
over the Rainbow Bridge in the course of this

56
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:52,380
upcoming fight. Throg is going to send them there
using the Bifrost. I should probably save that for

57
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,200
the speculation. Yeah, what are you doing? Now I
know your plan. But speaking of the speculation,

58
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:02,080
first to explain the methodology behind our
duels, let's go to our sentient dual simulator,

59
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:07,460
Alfred Jarvis, 9000. AJ9K tell our listeners how
you go about determining a winner in our dual

60
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:13,780
matchups. Yes, of course, sir. The way I determine
a winner between the two teams is by running 1,000

61
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:19,060
Monte Carlo simulations between every character
on each team using their statistics. A Monte Carlo

62
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:24,260
simulation is a probabilistic model used to
determine outcomes through random sampling. In

63
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:29,440
this case, I randomize the statistics along a
normal distribution as a way to simulate the many

64
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,400
variables that can occur during battle. The stat
parameters are based on the official Marvel power

65
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,680
grid, from which the DC characters statistics are
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are

66
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:45,240
included such as range, damage potential,
versatility and perception in order to create a

67
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:50,560
more detailed and accurate simulation. The
results of the 49,000 simulations provide a

68
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,580
percentage of wins for each character on both
teams. The team with the higher average win rate is

69
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,920
declared the victor as they have a higher
probability to win any given battle. In an

70
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,180
equitable pairing, neither team should win 100%
of the matches. The comic book stories have shown

71
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,580
that there's even a way for Batman to defeat
Superman, so the confidence rate of my method

72
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,580
falls in line with the precedents that have been
established in the source material. My

73
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:18,200
mathematical simulations are without
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole

74
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:24,860
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K.

75
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,020
Before we run the simulations, though, we like to
break down each team's histories and rosters

76
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:34,600
before improvising a scenario on how we imagine
one of the thousands of simulations would play

77
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:41,000
out, beat for beat. And it is my turn to go first with
the DC team's backstory. So let me tell you all

78
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,520
about the Legion of Superpets. During a temporal
crisis involving the alien brain globes, the

79
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,400
Legion of Super Heroes, who you can learn more
about in their team duel against the new mutants,

80
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:57,860
determined that the beings were attempting to
influence Earth's past through indirect

81
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:04,440
temporal interference using the pets of high
profile historical figures to counter the threat

82
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:10,520
without destabilizing the timeline. The Legion
selected super powered animals whose senses and

83
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:16,280
instincts could track and counter the threat with
minimal disruption. Under the coordination of

84
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,280
Brainiac five with Saturn girl providing
telepathic oversight and communication,

85
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,400
several animals were gathered from different
points in history and brought to the 30th century

86
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,880
operating together for the first time. Krypto the
super dog, Strixie the super cat, Beppo the super

87
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,120
monkey and Comet the super horse confronted the
brain globes, disrupting and neutralizing their

88
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,120
influence on the timeline. Following the
mission, Saturn girl formally designated the

89
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:50,220
animals as the Legion of Superpets with chameleon
boys, shape shifting pet, Prody the second

90
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,520
joining the team before the animals were
eventually returned to their respective eras.

91
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,940
Following the multiverses collapse after the
crisis on infinite Earth's, the Legion of

92
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,840
Superpets did not operate as an active team,
though various super pets continue to appear

93
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:11,160
alongside their individual allies pets such as
Krypto and Ace the bat hound operated as

94
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:17,520
supporting characters as did Wonder Romans pet
Jumper, one of the battle trained Kangas raised on

95
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:24,020
Themyscira. Kangas sometimes referred to as sky
Kangas were bred by the Amazon's for

96
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:29,960
extraordinary leaping ability and long distance
traversal capable of crossing oceans, hostile

97
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:36,560
terrain, planetary bodies and even mythic
boundaries in a single bound. Jumper formed a bond

98
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,600
with Wonder Roman and served as her mount during
multiple engagements, particularly in

99
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,220
conflicts involving mythological threats.
Jumper accompanied Wonder Roman both on and

100
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:52,300
beyond Themyscira and soil, participating in
confrontations with hostile forces and

101
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:57,540
assisting during expeditions that required
mobility and resilience beyond conventional

102
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:02,920
transport. Like the invisible jet, another
prominent pets amongst DC's most well known

103
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:09,600
champions was Toppo, an unusually intelligent
octopus native to the seas of Atlantis. After

104
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,340
entering the service of Aquaman, Toppo became
involved in numerous undersea operations,

105
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,660
particularly those requiring infiltration,
sabotage or interaction with Atlantean and

106
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:25,820
surface world technology. His dexterity and
problem solving ability allowed him to

107
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:31,520
manipulate machinery, disable control systems
and operate complex equipment despite lacking

108
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,700
humanoid form. For a time, he was depicted as a
colossal undersea monster known as a Kraken, but

109
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:43,180
was later reverted back to being an octopus in
continuity. A variation on the Superpet team

110
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:49,980
concept did appear in far future continuity
during the events of the 853rd century. In that

111
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:55,960
era, animal based teams such as the Justice Legion
of Super Zoomorphs and the Legion of Super

112
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:03,400
Familiars operated alongside the Justice Legion
A, a future incarnation of the Justice League.

113
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:09,980
After the Flashpoint event reset DC's continuity
past and future, Krypto was alerted to a situation

114
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:17,120
involving a rash of dog nappings across Gotham.
Enlisting Titus on his mission to rescue the dogs,

115
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,180
Krypto went to Detective Chimp for help who
recounted the Legion of Superpet's last mission

116
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:28,620
in which Clay faces pets. The shapeshifting Clay
Critter died during a battle at Gotham Zoo with

117
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:35,260
various villainous pets such as Dexter, the Red
Lantern and Harley Quinn's hyenas, Bud and Lou.

118
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:40,960
Streekey the Supercat evidently blamed Krypto
for Critter's death and initially refused to help

119
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:47,160
Krypto on the new mission to save the kidnapped
dogs. Joined by Flexi, Plastic Man's elastic

120
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:53,440
parrot, the trio tracked down the dogs and their
abductor, a green-skinned alien who was

121
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,840
attempting to free Earth's pets from their human
masters. When Streekey brought Batcow to the

122
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:04,360
fray, the team was able to trap the alien and
deliver the missing dogs to Wayne Manor, forcing

123
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:10,300
Robin and Superboy to find their owners. Later,
after Batman was captured during a mission, Ace

124
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:15,880
the Bathound was taken and imprisoned alongside
other animals for experimentation, including a

125
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:22,020
trained grizzly bear, a pickpocketing squirrel,
a cybernetically enhanced chicken and an

126
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:27,700
unusually fast tortoise. After escaping
confinement, the team tracked down and rescued

127
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:32,780
Batman from the Joker and his underground fight
club. Though the chicken was killed during the

128
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:38,340
mission, the other animals survived, living on
the Wayne Manor estate, though Batman gave the

129
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:44,060
tortoise to the flash. Recently, Ace and Krypto
attempted to recruit Nightwing's three-legged

130
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:51,100
dog Haley, aka Bitewing, into the Legion of
Superpets on a mission to rescue Streekey from an

131
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:57,840
orbital satellite owned by Menagerie Man, who had
been abducting animals to form a private army.

132
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:04,680
Alongside Jumper the Kanga, Badge the Squirrel,
Gleek the Wonder Monkey, and Batcow, the Cow,

133
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,600
Bitewing found Streekey in the Menagerie, while
also managing to help free other super pets such as

134
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:18,580
Flexi, Wonder Dog, Toppo, Dexter, Bud and Lou,
Beppo the Super Monkey, and some Staro drones,

135
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:24,260
among others. After Menagerie Man's defeat, the
Legion returned to Earth to help the abducted

136
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:29,960
animals find homes, though Haley declined to
become an official member of the team. And that's

137
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:35,660
the Legion of Superpets backstory. Now, for my
seven-member roster for the Legion of Superpets,

138
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,120
I'm going with Krypto, Superman's Dog, who
possesses all of his powers and is a

139
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:46,780
representative of the original team, which was
comprised entirely of Superman's pets. I'm also

140
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:52,280
including Ace the Bat Hound, Batman's highly
trained canine operative, Jumper, Wonder Romans

141
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:57,840
the Moskeren Kanga, with exceptional strength
and leaping power, Badge the Green Lantern, the

142
00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:04,000
Squirrel-like alien protector of Sector 1014,
and successor to Chip, who we had to duel with

143
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,860
against Rocket Raccoon. I'm also including
Toppo, Aquaman's highly intelligent and

144
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:14,180
stealthy octopus friend, the terrific What's It,
a durable tortoise with super speed like the

145
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:20,760
Flash, and finally, Flexi, a parrot with Plastic
Man's shapeshifting powers, though it's unclear

146
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:28,280
as to whether he's an actual parrot or a piece of
Plastic Man that thinks it is. That's hilarious.

147
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,820
We forgot to mention earlier when we were talking
about the pets' cinematic appearances that Toppo

148
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:39,900
played a sizable role in the Aquaman The Lost
Kingdom movie. Right, that's correct. Although

149
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:46,820
in that movie, his name wasn't Toppo. Toppo was the
task force that he was a part of. OK, he was pretty

150
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:52,140
cool, though. I am surprised to learn that Robot
Chicken used to be a member of the Legion of

151
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:57,480
Superpets. Yeah, I think it was supposed to be a
cyborg analog. The superhero cyborg from the

152
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,500
time. Yes, yes. Yeah. OK, so his pet is Robot
Chicken. Interesting. It makes sense, though,

153
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:09,360
because Robot Chicken is owned by Cartoon
Network, which is owned by WB, which also owns DC.

154
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:16,680
DC has such a vast universe of pet characters, like
almost every hero in DC Comics has some kind of

155
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:22,320
animal analog that exists in their pet universe.
Yeah, almost. Yeah, it's much larger than

156
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,740
Marvel's. But that's a good thing. We don't want to
make DC's larger than Marvel in general, my guy. I

157
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:32,220
don't think so. I don't know about that. I'm pretty
sure they're about the same. I'm talking about

158
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:38,860
endowment wise. You're stupid. Let me go ahead and
get into the backstory of the pet Avengers. The

159
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:44,360
story of the pet Avengers begins with Lockjaw, who
is the genetically altered dog of the inhuman

160
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:49,560
royal family created through experimental
terror genesis and bonded to the ruling house of

161
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:55,400
Aegon, possessing the innate ability to teleport
himself and others across vast distances over

162
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:01,320
Earth and space. Lockjaw became indispensable to
the inhumans as both transportation and

163
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,240
protector. Over years spent moving the inhuman
royal family through political upheavals,

164
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,160
exiles and interstellar conflicts. Lockjaw
developed a reputation for intelligence and

165
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,540
judgment that went far beyond instinctive
obedience. You can learn more about the inhumans

166
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:21,660
and their duel against the Wildcats. The chain of
events that let the formation of the pet Avengers

167
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:28,500
begin when Mr. Fantastic of the Fantastic Four
arrived in Adalan, the inhuman city located in the

168
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,820
blue area of the moon. Mr. Fantastic sought Black
Bolt's cooperation in locating the Infinity

169
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:39,920
Gems, which were six ancient cosmic artifacts
tied to the fundamental aspects of existence that

170
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:45,560
had begun resurfacing throughout the universe.
Unknown to Mr. Fantastic and most of the inhuman

171
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:53,020
court, Lockjaw had already encountered one of the
gems. Hidden within Adalan itself, the Mind Gem

172
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:57,980
had come into Lockjaw's possession, enhancing
his intelligence and granting him telepathic

173
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,420
abilities. Through contact with the Mind Gem,
Lockjaw became aware not only of the existence of

174
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:09,260
the other gems, but of the catastrophic danger
posed if they were gathered by a single wielder. By

175
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:14,680
then reading Mr. Fantastic's Slots, Lockjaw
learned of Thanos and his past dominion over the

176
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:20,760
gems. Rather than alerting Earth's heroes or the
inhumans, Lockjaw acted on the belief that a

177
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:26,160
quieter, less visible approach stood a better
chance of success. Using his teleportation

178
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:31,960
abilities, he set out to locate the remaining gems
himself, choosing allies who would not draw

179
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,560
attention. Lockjaw's first recruits were
animals already connected to heroes and

180
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:42,700
accustomed to danger. His first recruit was
Throg, the Frog of Thunder, who wielded a fragment

181
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:47,820
of Thor's enchanted hammer, Mjolnir, that
granted him powers proportionate to the God of

182
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:53,540
Thunder. Throg was once Simon Walterson, a
grieving human cursed into Frog form after

183
00:17:53,540 --> 00:18:00,400
failing to pay a fortune teller. Living as the Frog
Puttlegub in Central Park, he became a warrior in a

184
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:06,160
long-running war between frogs and rats. During
one of Loki's schemes, Thor himself was

185
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:12,280
transformed into a frog and crossed paths with
Puttlegub, helping end the war. When Thor returns

186
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:18,160
to Asgard, a shard of Mjolnir was left behind.
Puttlegub proved worthy enough to lift it,

187
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:24,100
transforming into Throg. Lockjaw's next recruit
was Lockheed, the small but formidable alien

188
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:29,780
dragon who brought a long history of interstellar
combat experience and loyalty forged through his

189
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:35,700
bond with the X-Man Kitty Pride. Lockheed
originated as a warrior from a dragon-like alien

190
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:41,940
species known as the Flock. Renowned for fighting
the parasitic Brood aliens, Lockheed left his

191
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,680
people behind after saving Kitty Pride and
followed her to Earth. You can learn more about

192
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:53,740
Kitty Pride in our Gypsy vs Shadowcat dual
episode. Next on the team was Niels, a cat who was

193
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:59,560
exposed to extra dimensional energy alongside
his owner, Speedball, of the new warriors. Niels

194
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:04,500
took on the codename Hairball after developing
the ability to form a kinetic field around himself

195
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:10,020
that redirects and amplifies all force and energy
exerted against him. You can learn more about

196
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,100
Speedball and the new warriors in their
respective duels against Wally West the Flash and

197
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:22,280
Infinity Inc. Redwing, who is Falcon's trained
bird and Ms. Lion and Maze Dog, completed

198
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:28,120
Lockjaw's initial group. Their search for the
gems led first to the Savageland, an isolated

199
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:34,140
prehistoric preserve hidden in Antarctica.
There the group encountered Zabu, the Sabertooth

200
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:40,460
Tiger companion of the Jungle Lord Khazar. Zabu
was born in the Savageland, orphaned when man apes

201
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:46,220
killed his family. Raised among wolves before
striking out alone, Zabu eventually saved the

202
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:52,660
life of a young man named Kevin Plunder, forming a
bond that would shape Kevin into the Jungle leader

203
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:59,960
Khazar. Exposure to the gases of the Place of Mists
slowed Zabu's aging and granted him near human

204
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:04,860
intelligence. You can learn more about the
Savageland in our Parasite vs Sauron dual

205
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:10,440
episode. Zabu aided the group in locating the Time
Gem and joined their journey. From the

206
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,340
Savageland, Lockjaw transported the animals to
prehistoric Earth, where they recovered the

207
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:20,500
Space Gem after an encounter with Devil Dinosaur,
whom you can learn more about in his duo alongside

208
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Moongirl against Dorothy Spinner. Continuing
their pursuit, the group traveled beneath the

209
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,700
Atlantic Ocean, where they were swallowed by the
massive creature Giganto. Inside the beast, they

210
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:37,200
discovered both the Soul Gem and the Reality Gem
before escaping. The final Gem, the Power Gem, was

211
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,780
located at the White House, attached to the collar
of the President's dog. As the animals converged

212
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:48,600
on their last objective, Thanos arrived, having
tracked the same cosmic energies. When the

213
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:54,680
animals refused to surrender their gems, Thanos
attacked and killed Miss Lion. In a moment of panic

214
00:20:54,680 --> 00:21:00,020
and grief, Hairball instinctively used the Soul
Gem to resurrect her. Acting together, the

215
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:05,180
animals combined the power of the Infinity Gems
and under Lockjaw's direction defeated Thanos

216
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:11,180
and trapped him in another dimension. With the
team victorious, Miss Lion named the group the Pet

217
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:16,420
Avengers. Before returning the Gems, Lockjaw
used the Mind Gem to establish a psychic link

218
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:21,880
between the animals, ensuring they could find one
another again if needed. Though the Pet Avengers

219
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:26,440
initially separated, the psychic bond
eventually drew them back together. When Throg

220
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:31,540
vanished while searching for meaning beyond
Central Park, the group reunited and traveled to

221
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:36,160
the Himalayas, becoming entangled in a conflict
within the dream realm. There, they confronted

222
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,240
creatures unleashed by the Fallen One and worked
to return displaced mythical beings to their

223
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,540
homes. Later, when Thor, Captain America, and
Iron Man were transformed into frogs by the dragon

224
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:53,000
Fin-Fink Fooom, Thor sent a telepathic distress
call that reached Throg. The Pet Avengers

225
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,520
responded, eventually aiding Fin-Fink Fooom,
when they learned his actions were meant to

226
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,320
protect endangered dragon eggs. Their
intervention briefly placed them at odds with the

227
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,560
Avengers, but the conflict ended peacefully. You
can learn more about Fin-Fink Fooom in his duel

228
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:13,000
against Star-O, the Conqueror. In recognition of
their actions, the Avengers constructed the Pet

229
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Avengers Mansion to serve as the team's
headquarters. That's the Pet Avengers backstory

230
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,760
for the seven-member team duel. I'm including
some famous pet and animal characters from

231
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:28,800
outside the comic Pet Avengers roster, that
better pair up against your Legion of Super Pets.

232
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:35,760
So in addition to Lockjaw, Throg, Lockheed,
Hairball, and Zabu, I'm also including Cosmo the

233
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:42,240
Space Dog and Jeff the Land Shark. Now Cosmo the
Space Dog has already had a duel against Dexstar,

234
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:48,180
the Red Lantern. Cosmo began as an Earth dog
launched into orbit by the Soviet space program.

235
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,700
An exposure to cosmic radiation granted him
telepathy, telekinesis, heightened

236
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:58,800
intelligence, and extended life. Lost in space,
Cosmo eventually became Chief of Security on

237
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:04,220
Nowhere, which is a space station formed from the
severed head of a celestial, and Cosmo operated as

238
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,120
a cosmic defender and ally to the Guardians of the
Galaxy, whom you can learn more about in their duel

239
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,300
against the Doom Patrol. Jeff the Land Shark is a
fan favorite and a personal favorite. He's new to

240
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:21,880
this podcast. He's actually the pet of Gwenpool
and formerly the pet of Kate Bishop Hawkeye. He was

241
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:28,100
created by MODOK, the villainous leader of the AIM
organization, as part of a line of engineered land

242
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:33,640
sharks. Adopted rather than weaponized, Jeff
demonstrated heightened intelligence,

243
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:39,240
loyalty, and adaptability that placed him firmly
among Earth's heroic animals. You can learn more

244
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,180
about his creator MODOK in his duel against Hector
Hammond. So that's the pet Avengers lineup for

245
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:51,420
this duel. Again, it's Lockjaw, the Inhuman Dog,
Lockheed, the Purple Pet Dragon, Hairball, the

246
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:58,300
Bouncing Cat, Throg, the Frog of Thunder, Zabu,
the Saber Tooth Tiger, Cosmo, the Space Dog, and

247
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:04,520
Jeff the Land Shark. Initially, I was thinking
about going with Chewie, aka Goose, in the movies.

248
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,500
He is a flurkin who you may remember from the
Captain Marvel movies, but I ended up replacing

249
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:15,080
him with Hairball, not only because Hairball was a
prominent member of the pet Avengers, but also

250
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:21,920
because I feel like between Jeff the Land Shark and
like Zabu, I don't think Goose really brought too

251
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:26,660
much more to the table. Yeah, initially, I was
going to include Gleek, the Wonder Twins monkey,

252
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:31,220
who we've actually put in a duel against Hit
Monkey, but I decided to go with Flexi instead

253
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:37,180
because I thought he was a better representative
for Prody the Second, one of the early members of

254
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:42,240
the Legion since they're both shapeshifters.
Yeah, and Hairball was a better pairing with

255
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:50,120
what's it, the Flash Turtle. Right. So really, the
pairings are Krypto and Throg, Ace with Zabu,

256
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:56,580
Jumper with Lockjaw, What's It with Hairball,
Badge the Green Lantern with Cosmo the Space Dog,

257
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:02,640
Toppo with Jeff the Land Shark, and Flexi with
Lockheed. And we do these pairings in order to

258
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:15,540
ensure general fairness between the rosters and
the overall matchup. These collide in Heroes

259
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:21,660
Clash. One podcast network rises above the rest.

266
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,420
that we've got their histories and the rosters out
of the way, let's speculate on how one of the

267
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:12,060
thousands of simulated matches will go. The
winning team is determined by simulations, not

268
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:17,320
the speculation, but it's fun to imagine how the
fight could play out. A.J. and N.K., what are the

269
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:23,340
rules of our speculations? Well, I should say
there are no rules, other than the teams have no

270
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:28,520
prior knowledge of the other going into the fight.
All they are aware of starting out is that the other

271
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,360
side is a threat that needs to be eliminated. For
the speculation, the groups will begin

272
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,280
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript
environment that will have no bearing on the match

273
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:43,800
itself, as no environmental statistics are
considered in my simulations. The teams must earn

274
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:48,940
victory on their own merit. Alright, then let's
get into it. The Legion of Super Pets and the Pet

275
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:54,760
Avengers meet on the battlefield. Who goes first?
I'll say that what's it starts off since he's the

276
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:00,280
resident speedster. And he's going to begin by
running circles around the pet Avengers,

277
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:06,660
creating this whirlwind tornado that hampers the
pet Avengers vision and also even lifts some of the

278
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:14,080
lighter ones like hairball into the air. And with
the pet Avengers hampered by this tornado, Jumper

279
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:19,080
is going to spring into action, just pinballing
between each one, knocking them all to the ground

280
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:27,460
with their super hard kicks. You mean Jumper jumps
right into Frog Yulnir, which is the name of Frog's

281
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:32,260
enchanted hammer, and Jumper gets knocked the
fuck back because while the pet Avengers were

282
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:38,180
trapped in what's its tornado, Frog spun his
hammer in the opposite direction to create a

283
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:46,020
counter whirlwind. So with the wind dissipated,
Cosmo sees what's it just running around and Cosmo

284
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:51,160
telekinetically flips the turtle onto his shell.
So what's it's not going to be running anywhere for

285
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:58,220
a while on his back? Alright, that's a good one. I'm
going to say Badge is going to fly into the air and

286
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:03,560
he's going to create this huge bazooka that looks
like a hollowed out tree trunk. And he's like, suck

287
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:08,700
on these nuts! And he starts launching softball
sized acorns at the pet Avengers. Well, that's

288
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:14,100
going to cause the pet Avengers to scatter and
Lockjaw is going to teleport behind Badge and just

289
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:19,480
snatch him out of the air in his jaws. And he's going
to land onto the ground in the middle of the Legion

290
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:24,960
of Superpets with this massive thud, because
Lockjaw's a huge dog, and Lockjaw shakes Badge

291
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:31,800
like a chew toy, snapping Badge's neck. I mean,
Badge would be able to escape by constructing like

292
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:38,920
a giant branch that pries Lockjaw's mouth open.
And then Ace, from his utility collar, he's going

293
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:44,360
to toss a tear gas pellet down Lockjaw's throat
poisoning him. Except that Lockjaw would just

294
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:51,580
teleport out of the way, so the tear gas misses and
Ace just tear gassed his own teammate, Krypto.

295
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:57,220
Meanwhile, Lockheed is going to swoop over to
Flexi, the parrot, and Lockheed shoots a fireball

296
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:03,040
from his mouth that just melts Flexi into a puddle.
I'm going to say Flexi stretches out of the way to

297
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:08,700
dodge that fireball, because Toppo saw Lockheed
swooping in and blinded him with a squirt of ink

298
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:15,680
into his dragon eyes. So not only does the fireball
miss, it hits hairball instead, and Lockheed

299
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:21,640
crashes right into Zabu. Okay, Zabu would get
knocked over, yeah, but hairball would be fine,

300
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:26,620
like the fireball would just bounce off of his
kinetic field. And that's when hairball bounces

301
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:32,680
into action. He's going to jump over to Ace, he's
going to bounce off of him and crash into Badge, and

302
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:37,980
then bounce off of him. And now he has all this
kinetic energy stored up in the form of these neon

303
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:44,220
colored balls surrounding him, and hairball just
unloads that kinetic energy like a volley of

304
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:50,040
cherry bomb explosives over at Krypto, who just
gets bombarded from all sides. Hairball is a cool

305
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:54,780
character. I forgot that he existed. To me, he's
even probably more dangerous than Speedball

306
00:29:54,780 --> 00:30:02,120
because he has claws. Right, he's terrifying.
Yeah. Okay, so Krypto gets bombarded. It would

307
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:07,240
knock him around for sure. But I mean, hairball
just pissed him off now. And so he's going to growl

308
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:12,560
at hairball and then just freeze him with his
freeze breath, putting him on ice. And then Flexi

309
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:18,800
flies over to Jeff the Land Shark, dive bombing him
and shape shifting into a cannonball that

310
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:24,920
straight up knocks Jeff out. Jeff would just open
his mouth and swallow the cannonball. You know,

311
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:30,900
like Jeff has eaten the Infinity Gauntlet before.
I'm pretty sure he can handle a cannonball and he's

312
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:37,600
just going to lick his lips and be like, yum. All
right. Shit. Flexi, you know, he's probably

313
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:44,420
freaking out in Jeff's stomach, but he's going to
transform into a spiked ball. Just damaging all of

314
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:49,240
Jeff's internal organs. Yeah, that would
definitely give Jeff indigestion. So what he's

315
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:54,340
going to do, he's going to puke up Flexi into like
this gross puddle, like a puddle with a parrot

316
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:59,340
head. And Flexi is like gasping for air now that
he's out of Jeff's stomach. But Jeff is going to

317
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:04,960
snatch him off the ground and he's going to
forcibly fashion Flexi into this red cape, kind of

318
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,560
like Krypto's cape. And then Jeff is going to
strike a pose kind of like Superman. He turns into

319
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:17,140
Super Jeff, we'll say. What? And yeah, he does
stuff like this. He puts on costumes and Super Jeff

320
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:24,020
then leaps over to Toppo, just chomping down onto
one of Toppo's tentacles. And, you know, Toppo's

321
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:29,340
going to flail around, but Jeff is not going to let
go. All right. Well, that's happening. Jumper is

322
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:35,500
going to spring toward Lockjaw and just punch the
dog right in the nose repeatedly. Like it's a speed

323
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:41,480
bag. And then she's going to finish off her combo by
leaning back on her tail and kicking Lockjaw so

324
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:48,900
hard that he literally leaves the planet's orbit.
What? Yeah, her legs are that strong. Okay. Well,

325
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:56,440
hopefully her neck is strong because Zabu pounces
on Jumper and he sinks his giant fangs that are like

326
00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:02,520
10 inches long into her neck, taking her out. Wow.
It's the circle of life. It happens. And meanwhile

327
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:09,160
Lockheed is going to thaw out hairball from being
frozen using his flame breath. So hairball is

328
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:16,660
free. All right. Well, badge is going to trap Zabu
in a green cage construct and is going to pull out

329
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:24,180
his fangs on all of his teeth with a pair of pliers
that he created. So now Zabu is just all gums. And

330
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:30,160
what's it? You know, he's flipped back over on a
shell. He's back on his feet. He's going to slam

331
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:36,800
into Jeff, the Land Shark at full speed like a
missile, which he was able to do because both Topo

332
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:44,000
and Flexi were choking Jeff out because Jeff was
dumb enough to use Flexi as a cape. And you know,

333
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:50,960
Topo has other tentacles. Jeff's out. You can't,
you can't hurt Jeff the Land Shark, man. It's Jeff.

334
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,680
Jeff had it coming. Well, everyone's going to be
pissed about this. They're going to be shocked

335
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:59,920
that Jeff was hurt because Jeff is like the cutest
thing ever. Throg's not going to have it. So he

336
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:05,860
leaps into the air and brings his hammer down onto
What's It just straight up stomping a turdy to mush

337
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:11,000
like Super Mario. I mean, What's It has a really
durable shell, but it's probably not strong

338
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,580
enough to stop Frog Mjolnir or whatever you call
it. Frog Mjolnir. Whatever. Meanwhile, Ace and

339
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:25,240
Zabu are scoring off. And when this toothless Zabu
lunges, Ace is just going to front flip over him and

340
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:31,320
plant a small taser disk on the scruff of his neck,
which he then triggers. And it's going to fry

341
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:36,900
Zabu's nervous system. So he's out. A front flip.
You think Ace is like a badass or something? Hell

342
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:42,240
yeah, I do. He's not that cool. He's lucky that Zabu
didn't have fangs anymore, is what I'll say. Well,

343
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,480
that's happening. Cosmo is going to take control
of Flexi's mind using his telepathy and he's going

344
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:56,240
to make Flexi transform into the Kono shame, like
that Kono collar that dogs get after the vet. Yeah.

345
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,480
And Cosmo is going to telekinetically place that
over Ace. And then he's going to force Flexi to

346
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:10,980
tighten the collar, which just puts Ace to sleep.
The big sleep. Alright. Meanwhile, Badge has

347
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:17,960
trapped Hairball inside of a box with a knockout
gas capsule, which he then launches into space. So

348
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:23,820
Hairball's out. So you just turned Hairball into
Schrodinger's cat. That means he is neither alive

349
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:29,239
nor unalive. Yeah, good job. We don't know whether
he's alive or dead. We do know though he is

350
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:35,100
definitely out of the match. Alright. While
that's happening, Lakja, he teleports back to the

351
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:41,420
battlefield after getting kicked into space by
Jumper. And he is going to drop right down onto

352
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:49,060
Toppo and just squish him into Octopus soup. I
mean, Lakja is like such a fat sack of crap with so

353
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:55,540
many folds of skin on his body. I'm sure Toppo can
find a place to squeeze into at the last second,

354
00:34:55,540 --> 00:35:00,960
which he does. And he's going to camouflage
himself so that no one notices him. He's going to

355
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,940
sneak away undetected. Well, I mean, Lockheed
would be able to sense Toppo with his empathic

356
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:12,020
senses. So Lockheed flies over to Toppo, despite
being camouflaged and just turns him into

357
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:17,460
Kalimari with his flame breath. Yeah, but I mean
Toppo's pretty agile. So sure, one of his

358
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:22,700
tentacles gets singed, but then Toppo's just
going to grab Lockheed's neck with his other

359
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:28,820
tentacles, choking off the flame before swinging
onto his face like a face hugger and biting

360
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:36,260
Lockheed's jugular with his octopus beak. So
Lockheed's out. That's horrifying. Throg sees

361
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:43,040
that and he shoots a blast of lightning at Toppo and
that fries Toppo, turning him into delicious

362
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:50,240
Kalimari. Are you hungry or something? I could go
for some takeout. You want some frog legs? Because

363
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,580
while Throg is distracted taking out Toppo,
Krypto Heat Visions Throg right in half at the

364
00:35:55,580 --> 00:36:03,200
waist. So there you go. I do not love frog legs. So
no, thank you. Too bad you've been served. Okay,

365
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,640
then Lockjaw is going to teleport Krypto into
space to some planet that has a red sun. And then

366
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:14,780
Lockjaw is going to teleport back into the fight.
So Krypto's out. Wait, how would Lockjaw even know

367
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:20,840
to do that? Like, I say he teleported him to a planet
with a yellow sun. I mean, something like three

368
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:28,100
fourths of all suns in the universe are red, like
red dwarfs. So it was just an odds game. Lockjaw had

369
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:33,680
a three fourths chance to get Krypto in front of a
red sun. That sounds like made up bullshit. No,

370
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,540
that's true. It's true. They far outnumber the
amount of yellow suns in the universe. Well,

371
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:45,620
that's lame. I'm going to say that Badge is going to
then construct a muzzle over Lockjaw once he

372
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:51,220
returns and then inject him right away with a
syringe construct. And he's also going to create a

373
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:59,820
boombox that plays Sarah McLaughlin's song in the
arms of the angels as Lockjaw passes out. What the

374
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:06,140
fuck? See, this is why last year we went with a dog
show instead of a dog fight. It's just way too sad

375
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:12,700
for pets to be taking each other out like this.
Borderline Evil. Cosmo, who's still in control of

376
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:18,720
Flexi, the parrot, Cosmo's going to force him to
shape shift into a sword and he's going to swing it

377
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,860
at Badge. The Badge is going to block it with a
shield construct and then form a sword of his own.

378
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:30,060
Alright, so yeah, Cosmo and Badge are going to
sword fight with their sword constructs, but you

379
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:36,800
forget that Cosmo's sword construct is Flexi, so
when Badge cleaves through Cosmo's sword, he just

380
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:45,030
took out Flexi the parrot. Well, okay, so it's just
Badge and Cosmo now then. So, alright, suddenly

381
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:51,880
this tall green forest is going to appear around
Cosmo and from the trees he suddenly sees

382
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:57,760
thousands of green eyes appear before this
massive swarm of squirrel construct creatures

383
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:04,860
attack Cosmo simultaneously. Just overwhelming
his telekinesis and defeating Cosmo the same way

384
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:11,520
that Squirrel Girl defeated Dr. Doom, Galactus,
and many other Marvel characters more powerful

385
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:17,240
than Cosmo. First of all, Squirrel Girl did not
defeat Galactus, really, and it certainly wasn't

386
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,680
through an ambush of squirrels like how she
defeated Dr. Doom. Second of all, I don't know how

387
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:28,440
these squirrels are going to get past Cosmo's
force field, and third of all, Badge thinks that's

388
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:33,240
what happened, but in reality it was just a
telepathic illusion that Cosmo put into his

389
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:40,400
squirrel brain using her telepathy. In
actuality, Badge is just an entrant and then Cosmo

390
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,260
shuts his mind down. So, match over. Ooh, sorry,
you see Badge put on armor when he was sword

391
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:51,280
fighting and he was wearing a helmet and per Marvel
rules, you can't telepathically get through a

392
00:38:51,280 --> 00:39:00,100
helmet. No, he just thought that he had a helmet on
his head because it was an illusion. So dumb. We can

393
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:07,140
go ahead and leave the match there. Either the
Legion of Superpets wins by ambushing Cosmo with a

394
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:13,640
Legion of Green Construct Squirrels, or the Pet
Avengers wins because all of that was an illusion

395
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:19,540
and Badge gets his mind shut down. Let's go ahead
and input all the characters and team stats, run

396
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:32,000
the simulations, and come back with a winner.
AG9K, hit it. Okay, this is a fun match. I'm really

397
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,340
glad we got a chance to do this as our last holiday
pet duel. I like to both of these lineups a lot.

398
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:44,900
Same, and they came out fairly comparable to each
other in terms of their stats. When you look at the

399
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:52,300
overall team stats, the greatest advantage that
DC had over Marvel was durability. A lot of the DC

400
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:58,020
characters like Krypto and Jumper and Green
Lantern and even Flexi the Parrot had a lot more

401
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:04,400
durability over the Pet Avengers and they were
also faster. Like Krypto, What's It, Green

402
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,260
Lantern, they all had really high speed stats
compared to the Pet Avengers. But the Pet Avengers

403
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:18,840
had the edge in intelligence because Throg has a
human mind and Cosmo the Space Dog is also hyper

404
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:24,340
intelligent and the Pet Avengers also had an
advantage in perception, largely because,

405
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:29,960
again, Cosmo is telepathic and no one on the Legion
of Superpets is telepathic. That's right. We said

406
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:35,160
they were fairly comparable when it came to
fighting skill and invasiveness. The most

407
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:41,380
powerful character overall was by far Badge the
Green Lantern. I'm so sick of these damn Green

408
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:50,060
Lanterns. Yeah, Badge totally stomped. He won
86.4% of his matches, which is really high. I mean,

409
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:57,340
your most powerful member Cosmo only won 77.1.
Yeah, Throg was right up there with Cosmo as well,

410
00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:05,760
winning 74.5% of all his matches. The weakest pet
out of both sides was Jeff the Land Shark. Yeah, but

411
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:13,900
if we had a stat for a cute factor, he'd win that for
sure. Over Badge? I think not. Yes, over Badge. A

412
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:20,460
squirrel or a shark? No way a shark is cuter. This
shark is. Does Badge put on silly little cute

413
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:28,640
costumes all the time? Does Badge have dead shark
eyes? Eh, Jeff's eyes are anything but dead.

414
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,580
They're not like a doll's eyes. But overall,
considering all of these stats, Joseph, who do you

415
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:38,620
think came out on top in this team? The pet
Avengers. Don't even ask me. Just assume that I'm

416
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:42,980
going to go with the Marvel side because Marvel
side will always be better. Even though our

417
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:50,320
Instagram followers don't think so because in our
poll for this matchup, 66% of them sided with the

418
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:56,080
Legion of Super Pets. As they should, as they
should, if they were smart, which they are. Now

419
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:04,520
they're dumb as shit, man. Wow, okay. All of you
heard it. Not all of them, just the ones that voted

420
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:10,320
for DC, of course. I don't know if that makes it any
better, but let's find out who won. AJ9K, the

421
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:18,480
results, please. Here you are, sir. The winner in
the Team Duel matchup between the Legion of Super

422
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:28,840
Pets and the pet Avengers is... The Legion of Super
Pets. Whatever. And it was a horrible Christmas.

423
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:38,800
It was so close. So, so close. They won 50.2% of
their matches compared to the pet Avengers who won

424
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:45,580
49.8%. That's insanely close. That's the
difference of four matches out of a thousand.

425
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:51,160
Yeah, it seems like a majority of these Team Duel's
that we do are all really close. Like, I think a

426
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,820
majority of them are within five percentage
points of each other. And I think it's because we

427
00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:02,540
take care to try and make sure that the rosters are
balanced. And when the stats average out in all of

428
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:07,960
the matches, it just ends up being really close.
This is the closest Team Duel results that we've

429
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:13,260
had in a long time. We haven't had one this close
since Guardians of the Galaxy vs Doom Patrol.

430
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:18,680
Interesting. I gotta say, I'm pretty sad this
Christmas season now that the pet Avengers lost.

431
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:24,440
I'm especially sad for Jeff. He deserved better. I
don't get Jeff. I know nothing about Jeff. I've

432
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:29,580
never seen Jeff in a comic except for the recent
crossover where he appeared with Krypto. Forget

433
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:35,480
Jeff. He's lame. Maybe go read a Jeff the Landshark
comic book and then come back and tell me that you

434
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:41,840
don't love him. Because that's impossible. I'm
good, bro. That sounds like kid shit for Marvel

435
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:48,640
fans. Or, you know, just people that don't have a
Grinch heart like you. Piece of shit. Why don't you

436
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,920
go read a Jeff the Landshark comic and have your
heart grow three sizes? I think that would be

437
00:43:52,920 --> 00:44:02,680
fatal, honestly. But that does it for this Team
Duel. AJ9K help close this out. Thanks for
