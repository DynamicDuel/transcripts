This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:28,291
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:33,354
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based

4
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:39,216
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother, Johnny DC. And in this episode,

5
00:00:39,236 --> 00:00:44,839
we're going to review the latest Marvel Studios
television release, Echo Season 1. The season

6
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:50,901
dropped a few weeks ago, but we're just getting
to reviewing it now. And uh, it was okay. It

7
00:00:50,961 --> 00:00:54,863
was alright. I feel like it's not as bad as
people are making it out to be, personally.

8
00:00:55,024 --> 00:00:58,946
I kind of enjoyed it. I know I enjoyed it more
than you at least, and I'm kind of interested

9
00:00:58,986 --> 00:01:02,188
to hear what you have to say about it. Oh, I'll
bring you down. I'll bring you down to my level.

10
00:01:02,408 --> 00:01:07,391
It'll be fine. Sweet. I have reasons. We'll
talk about them later. Before that, we're going

11
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:11,533
to break down the latest comic book movie news
to come out this past week, including the news

12
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:17,096
that Wilson Bethel is confirmed to return as
Bullseye in Daredevil Born Again, which is

13
00:01:17,136 --> 00:01:21,179
fantastic news. I can't wait to talk about that.
As always, we list our segment times in our

00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:13,633
win between Dragon Ball's son Gohan vs. Saint
Seiya's Phoenix Ikki? I don't know how to pronounce

35
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:17,975
the name. I don't know if that's right. I'm
sure you nailed it. On the Console Combat podcast,

41
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:54,484
out of the way, quick to the No Prize. A No
Prize is an award Marvel used to give out to

42
00:03:54,504 --> 00:04:00,447
fans. Our version, the Dynamic Dual No Prize,
is a digital award we post on Instagram for

43
00:04:00,487 --> 00:04:05,149
the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week we asked,

44
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:10,831
what comic storyline from Marvel or DC would
you want to see adapted as an animated film

45
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:16,474
trilogy and why? And this is coming off of the
review that we did last episode of Justice

46
00:04:16,494 --> 00:04:20,395
League Crisis on Infinite Earths, part one.
And holy crap, we got a lot of great answers

47
00:04:20,435 --> 00:04:23,557
for this question. Can't wait to talk about
them. Let's go ahead and run down our honorable

48
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:29,627
mentions and the no prize winner. Our first
honorable mention goes to Jacob Foster, who

49
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:33,509
said, So yeah, the video game of Injustice.

50
00:04:54,482 --> 00:04:59,344
only covered a portion of the story. As we know,
the comic series told everything that happened

51
00:04:59,624 --> 00:05:05,307
prior to the game, and it was a fantastic comic
series. I would love to see that series adapted,

52
00:05:05,608 --> 00:05:10,010
along with a subsequent film of the Injustice
storyline that happened during the video game,

53
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,093
followed up probably by the Injustice 2 storyline.
I think that would be a fantastic trilogy.

54
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:19,755
Yeah, we know that Injustice has already been
adapted into an animated film, but you know,

55
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:24,582
if you watch the movie or you listen to our
review of that film, you know that a wasn't

56
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:28,923
very good, so it would be nice to kind of get
a redo on that and tell the story right as

57
00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:34,644
a trilogy and not cram everything into one film.
Yeah, justice needs to be done to the story

58
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:40,246
of injustice. What about deceased? Yeah, deceased
could easily be a trilogy. Honestly, I feel

59
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:44,407
like it could be an entire series. There's a
lot of story there, like season upon season.

60
00:05:44,867 --> 00:05:48,968
And both injustice and deceased, if I remember
correctly, are written by the same guy. Oh,

61
00:05:49,008 --> 00:05:53,369
yes, that's correct. Tom Taylor. So great answer,
Jacob Foster. Our next honorable mention goes

62
00:05:53,409 --> 00:06:00,510
to... Nate Mantineo who said, Hey guys, Nate
here. And I would just like to say that I would

63
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:07,595
definitely have Annihilation be the three-part
movie event in an animated trilogy. I think

64
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:13,919
it's a great story with a ton of amount of cosmic
everything. Anybody who's anybody in the Marvel

65
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:18,922
Universe is going to be there and you want something
big leading up to that. So maybe build up a

66
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:23,485
movie universe and then have Annihilation. It
would just be great. Thanks guys, love the

67
00:06:23,505 --> 00:06:28,219
show. Yeah, this is a fantastic answer. It blew
my mind when I heard it, because I didn't even

68
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:33,700
conceive of this as an animated film trilogy,
but I would love to see Annihilation adapted

69
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:39,042
like that. It's to this day, the greatest cosmic
tale that Marvel has ever done, or one of the

70
00:06:39,062 --> 00:06:45,204
greatest, I should say, because it joined together
all of Marvel's spacefaring heroes and united

71
00:06:45,244 --> 00:06:49,945
them against a common threat of Annihilus and
his Annihilation wave. I think you could break

72
00:06:49,985 --> 00:06:55,772
it down into the prologue. for Annihilation
getting into the stories of like Drax and Nova

73
00:06:55,792 --> 00:07:00,654
and Silver Surfer and Super Skrull and basically
setting up all the characters in the first

74
00:07:00,694 --> 00:07:05,877
film. In the second one, really get into the
war against Nihilus and then have that end

75
00:07:05,898 --> 00:07:10,640
with probably Galactus getting captured and
then at the end get into the Heralds of Galactus

76
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,483
and the ultimate defeat of Annihilus. I think
that would play out perfectly. There was a

77
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:20,134
lot of story there. It was fantastic. We get
to explore characters like Nova as well. whom

78
00:07:20,214 --> 00:07:24,317
hasn't really got his due, I think, in the MCU.
Of course, this would be animated, but I think

79
00:07:24,337 --> 00:07:30,401
it would be incredible. Yeah, Nate's idea of
building up a entire animated universe just

80
00:07:30,421 --> 00:07:35,144
to have it possibly lead up to this Annihilation
trilogy is an interesting idea. It's kind of

81
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:40,508
the same thing that DC's doing in the Tomorrowverse,
building up this animated cinematic universe

82
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:45,792
just to tear it down with Crisis on Infinite
Earths. Yeah, I think Marvel could do it better

83
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:50,511
than DC, and I would pay good money to see it
happen. Dude, Marvel's animated movies suck.

84
00:07:50,531 --> 00:07:56,734
Like, you're not wrong, but also, shut your
mouth. Great answer, Nate. Our final honorable

85
00:07:56,774 --> 00:08:02,797
mention goes to Travis Herndon, who said, Hey
guys, Travis here. So my pick would have to

86
00:08:02,837 --> 00:08:07,900
be the Planet Hulk storyline. I know we had
a Planet Hulk movie back in the early 2000s,

87
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:15,164
so why not have two movies to finish the story
off or just revamp it and do a complete retelling

88
00:08:15,424 --> 00:08:19,891
that's faithful to the comics? I think. It's
time for us to actually get a faithful retelling

89
00:08:19,951 --> 00:08:24,854
of that amazing story about my whole. I love
the Planet Hulk story. I think this is a fantastic

90
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:29,257
answer. Of course, there already was a Planet
Hulk animated movie, which is probably one

91
00:08:29,297 --> 00:08:34,221
of Marvel's better animated films. And I would
just, yeah, like Travis said, work around that.

92
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:40,325
Or maybe you have the prelude to Planet Hulk,
where we get a solid Hulk story that ends with

93
00:08:40,365 --> 00:08:44,468
him being sent out into space by the Illuminati.
And then we have the Planet Hulk storyline

94
00:08:44,788 --> 00:08:50,007
as the second film and then culminate it with
the World War Hulk storyline. You don't get

95
00:08:50,047 --> 00:08:54,088
better than that. That would be cool. That'd
be really cool. It'd be way better than the

96
00:08:54,128 --> 00:08:58,930
Hulk we have now in the MCU. Just like silly,
smart Hulk. Yeah, we need like a good, solid,

97
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:03,692
destructive Hulk film. It's been a while, and
I don't think there's a better way to do it

98
00:09:03,932 --> 00:09:09,074
than a Planet Hulk trilogy of films. Great answer,
Travis. We wanna give a quick shout out to

99
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:14,356
Bideer Bangura, who gave the answer of Dark
Knight's Metal, Colby Hentges, who gave the

100
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:21,719
answer of House of M, who said Titans Beast
World and Travis Bailey, who gave the answer

101
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:28,501
of Marvel's Wastelanders. But the winner of
this week's No Prize is Scott Camacho, who

102
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:35,082
said, The story series I want DC to adapt into
animated would be the Blackest Night series

103
00:09:35,523 --> 00:09:43,685
of the Lantern Course. I think the lanterns
are due for an outstanding story to be told

104
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:51,834
animated and especially live action. And since
the movies have been darker lately, I'm thinking

105
00:09:51,874 --> 00:09:58,339
this would be a great time to pull that off,
Blackest Night. So this gets the win because

106
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:05,966
not only is Blackest Night an awesome storyline,
but it's already part of a comic trilogy that

107
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:11,870
began with Green Lantern Rebirth and led into
the Sinestro Corps War. only to be concluded

108
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:17,193
by Blackest Night, which was like a full DC
Universe spanning event. It's a fantastic trilogy

109
00:10:17,753 --> 00:10:22,555
and I'm really surprised that they haven't adapted
that onto screen yet. Like I thought that would

110
00:10:22,595 --> 00:10:27,058
have been perfect for the Tomorrowverse, those
three films. Yeah, I feel like Green Lantern

111
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:30,039
movies are far and few between. I don't know
if there's kind of like a chilling effect on

112
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:35,910
behalf of the studio due to the reception of
the 2011 Green Lantern movie, but... Fortunately,

113
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:40,111
we did get one Green Lantern film in the Tomorrowverse,
which was Blackest Night, which was a pretty

114
00:10:40,151 --> 00:10:45,032
solid movie, I thought. But yeah, I mean, the
greatest Green Lantern tale out there so far,

115
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:49,213
I think, is just ripe for the picking. Absolutely.
I would agree that it's the greatest Green

116
00:10:49,253 --> 00:10:54,715
Lantern story. You know, Green Lantern Rebirth
set up like the emotional spectrum. Sinestro

117
00:10:54,755 --> 00:11:00,696
Corps just ramped that up and really began introducing
the other color spectrums. And then Blackest

118
00:11:00,716 --> 00:11:06,498
Night just had this massive zombie outbreak
across the whole universe. fantastic. If they

119
00:11:06,538 --> 00:11:11,800
don't adapt it to animation, they need to adapt
it to live action. Like maybe for the television

120
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:15,122
series that James Gunn is producing. Yeah. I
mean, we don't know what story is going to

121
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:20,344
be adapted for James Gunn's television series,
lanterns. It's supposed to be like true detective

122
00:11:20,504 --> 00:11:25,906
esque, which doesn't sound cosmic to me, but
who knows? Great answer, Scotty. You win this

123
00:11:25,946 --> 00:11:30,288
week's no prize. If you the listener want a
shot at winning your own no prize, stay tuned

124
00:11:30,328 --> 00:11:35,091
to later on in this episode when we'll be asking
another question of the week. And now that

125
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:37,036
that's done, on to the news!

126
00:11:42,562 --> 00:11:47,885
Coming off the recent news that Debra Anwalt
and Eldon Henson will be returning as Karen

127
00:11:47,905 --> 00:11:53,549
Page and Foggy Nelson in the upcoming Daredevil
Born Again Disney Plus Marvel Studios television

128
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:59,814
series, we got even better news this week. It
was confirmed by Deadline that Wilson Bethel,

129
00:12:00,034 --> 00:12:05,718
who played Benjamin Poindexter aka Bullseye
on the Netflix Daredevil series, is going to

130
00:12:05,738 --> 00:12:11,542
be showing up in at least three episodes of
the series, which is currently filming. And

131
00:12:11,862 --> 00:12:16,264
if you guys watched the Netflix Daredevil show,
you're already super excited by this because

132
00:12:16,604 --> 00:12:21,846
Daredevil season 3 was not only great superhero
television, it was just fantastic television

133
00:12:21,886 --> 00:12:27,568
in general and a large part of that was due
to the fantastic portrayal of the extremely

134
00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:33,631
dangerous Daredevil villain Bullseye. Dude,
like the villains in the Daredevil series are

135
00:12:33,691 --> 00:12:38,753
amongst the best villains that have ever been
depicted on screen in my opinion. Bullseye

136
00:12:39,093 --> 00:12:45,002
in particular was unbelievably horrifying, way
more scary than I thought he would be. And

137
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:50,006
he was the character I was most hoping would
make a return for this new Daredevil show and

138
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:54,370
it's super exciting to hear that he is. Yeah,
a couple of weeks ago our question of the week

139
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:58,854
was, what other character from the Daredevil
Netflix series do you most hope returns for

140
00:12:59,014 --> 00:13:03,398
Disney Plus's Daredevil Born Again show? And
we got a few good answers, but the correct

141
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:08,718
answer as we stated in the last episode was
And then lo and behold, all of a sudden we

142
00:13:08,738 --> 00:13:13,699
get that confirmation. It's just so exciting
to see as a fan. I'm really hoping that in

143
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:19,301
this season we'll get to see him in his, like,
traditional iconic bullseye outfit or some

144
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:23,602
adaptation of that. For sure. Yeah, because
we didn't get to see that in Daredevil season

145
00:13:23,622 --> 00:13:28,403
three. I'm really loving all the choices that
Dario Skardapain seems to be making. And now

146
00:13:28,483 --> 00:13:32,925
that Marvel has kind of decided to reboot the
Daredevil series, it looks like they're giving

147
00:13:32,945 --> 00:13:38,562
fans exactly what they want. It looks like it's
going to be basically Netflix's Daredevil season

148
00:13:38,602 --> 00:13:43,023
four, which is everything that the fans could
hope for. Yeah, wouldn't it be great if they

149
00:13:43,063 --> 00:13:48,365
like also brought back Electra and we had like
the Bullseye versus Electra face off? That'd

150
00:13:48,405 --> 00:13:53,686
be dope. I mean, Electra already died in the
Daredevil Netflix series. She died at the end

151
00:13:53,706 --> 00:13:58,268
of season two. So I don't know if they would
want to retread that where she's like resurrected

152
00:13:58,288 --> 00:14:03,069
by the hand again, but no, I would like to see
Electra returned regardless. I thought Elodie

153
00:14:03,089 --> 00:14:08,083
Young made a fantastic Electra. Everyone in
that show was like perfectly cast. So glad

154
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:12,425
most of the cast is returning. Yeah, it seems
like Marvel is making all the right decisions,

155
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:16,047
you know, the same decisions that made them
so endearing to fans in the first place, where

156
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:20,290
they're truly giving us what we want to see,
you know? And why not? Like, studios do not

157
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:25,613
do that enough. Just freaking listen to the
fans. Exactly, exactly. But this news brings

158
00:14:25,653 --> 00:14:26,933

series out there guys a lot for you to choose
from I'm really looking forward to these answers

166
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:17,302
But that does it for all the news for this episode,
so let's go ahead and get into the main event,

167
00:15:17,743 --> 00:15:23,829
where we discuss the latest Disney Plus Marvel
Studios television series, Echo Season 1.

168
00:15:39,346 --> 00:15:44,528
ECHO Season 1 debuted a few weeks ago on Disney
Plus as the latest Marvel Studios television

169
00:15:44,548 --> 00:15:50,290
series, with the series led by head director
Sidney Freeland and starring Ilaquah Cox and

170
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:56,373
Vincent D'Onofrio. It's a spin-off series from
2021's Hawkeye Show, where the character of

171
00:15:56,473 --> 00:16:01,315
ECHO was introduced into the MCU as the daughter
of the tracksuit mafia leader who was killed

172
00:16:01,355 --> 00:16:07,619
by Hawkeye's alternate identity of Ronin. At
the end of that show, And I guess let me take

173
00:16:07,659 --> 00:16:12,023
this opportunity to say spoiler warning. This
is a spoiler review, not only for Echo season

174
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:17,848
one, but probably also for Hawkeye. At the end
of Hawkeye season one, Echo learned that the

175
00:16:17,908 --> 00:16:22,992
Kingpin led Ronin to the Track Suit Mafia's
hideout and was directly responsible for her

176
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:28,937
father's death. Seeking revenge, Echo shot Kingpin
in the face, believing him to be dead, which

177
00:16:28,977 --> 00:16:34,782
is where Echo season one picks up. Now, I enjoyed
Hawkeye season one. We rated it three and a

178
00:16:34,802 --> 00:16:39,984
half stars on this podcast. And while I was
interested in Echo's introduction, I wasn't

179
00:16:40,024 --> 00:16:46,146
sure at the time if she would be able to headline
her own series. Now that I've seen the series,

180
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:52,608
I guess I'm still wondering. That's not to discount
Alok Wacawks's performance, and we'll talk

181
00:16:52,628 --> 00:16:57,389
about that later. But I mean, like, let's be
honest, Echo was a series that really no one

182
00:16:57,549 --> 00:17:01,929
asked for. The character is not too popular
in the books, although I will say she is a

183
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:06,072
very interesting character, you should definitely
learn more about her in our question vs echo

184
00:17:06,132 --> 00:17:10,416
duel episode if you don't know anything about
her. But it seems that in this day and age

185
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:15,701
of Marvel Studios where they're finding themselves
in a situation of diminishing returns from

186
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:21,627
producing too much content that people are caring
less about, Echo season 1 seems like an unnecessary

187
00:17:21,647 --> 00:17:27,251
addition to their television catalog. I dunno,
I like the idea- of an Echo television series

188
00:17:27,311 --> 00:17:32,956
and that it could be something unique and that's
definitely what they shot for with this show.

189
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:38,801
Unique to the MCU for sure. Yeah absolutely.
Yeah and perhaps that's why with this series

190
00:17:38,841 --> 00:17:42,724
Marvel introduced the Marvel spotlight banner
which is supposed to represent projects in

191
00:17:42,744 --> 00:17:47,829
the MCU that aren't necessarily connected to
the main canon telling more grounded character

192
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:52,412
driven stories. Basically you don't have to
watch Echo season 1 to stay caught up with

193
00:17:52,432 --> 00:17:58,125
the Marvel Studios continuity. And I would say
unless you're really invested in the character

194
00:17:58,146 --> 00:18:03,051
of Echo, I don't know if I would bother with
this show. Unless of course Echo ends up being

195
00:18:03,091 --> 00:18:09,097
like a member of the New Avengers team or something
like that. I doubt that. You never know. I

196
00:18:09,117 --> 00:18:13,761
mean she was a member of the Avengers in the
comics, so yeah, you could be right. Maybe

197
00:18:13,902 --> 00:18:18,230
if you're looking for more grounded content,
you might be enticed to watch this. But even

198
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:23,293
then I wouldn't say Echo Season 1 really warranted
all the TVMA marketing that went into this

199
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:28,237
series. Absolutely. I feel like the worst stuff
was shown in the trailer. Yeah, it was basically

200
00:18:28,257 --> 00:18:35,502
a montage of all the violence. The trailer for
this was incredible and even won my brother's

201
00:18:35,542 --> 00:18:41,106
award for best trailer of last year. The marketing
seemed to promise a return to the type of rated-R

202
00:18:41,146 --> 00:18:45,909
storytelling that existed within the Marvel
Netflix series, like Daredevil, Jessica Jones,

203
00:18:45,949 --> 00:18:50,775
and The Punisher. I wouldn't say Echo seemed
very rated R outside of like one or two shots

204
00:18:50,795 --> 00:18:56,916
of violence, it seemed very PG-13 in my mind.
So even if you're a fan of the old Netflix

205
00:18:56,936 --> 00:19:01,358
shows and wanting more mature Marvel fare, I
don't think you'll be that satisfied with Echo

206
00:19:01,398 --> 00:19:06,179
Season 1 and it may be just better to wait for
the Daredevil Born Again series which will

207
00:19:06,199 --> 00:19:10,841
come out next year and is hopefully a return
to form for gritty grounded superhero shows.

208
00:19:10,861 --> 00:19:15,106
So what you're saying is no one's gonna find
this show satisfying. I don't think fans of

209
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:18,268
Echo will find this satisfying. I don't think
fans of the Marvel Netflix series will find

210
00:19:18,288 --> 00:19:23,032
this satisfying. I don't know who would find
this satisfying. But to get into what I didn't

211
00:19:23,072 --> 00:19:28,255
find disappointing about the show, it did have
about two badass action scenes, like one in

212
00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:31,958
episode one that actually included Daredevil,
which was awesome. That was cool. And there

213
00:19:31,978 --> 00:19:36,281
was another action scene in episode three that
took place in a skating rink. You know, in

214
00:19:36,321 --> 00:19:40,684
a five episode series, you would probably hope
for even more action, but those scenes were

215
00:19:40,704 --> 00:19:45,895
the best of what we got and they were great.
You'd expect the best action scene to be in

216
00:19:45,975 --> 00:19:51,978
episode five for like the climax, but nope,
it was episode one. Yeah. That's a little bit

217
00:19:51,998 --> 00:19:57,620
disappointing. The last action scene in the
climax of the show had a tremendously disappointing

218
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,622
resolution. It was almost as disappointing as
the resolution to She Hulk, but I wouldn't

219
00:20:01,662 --> 00:20:06,365
go that far. You know, at least we had some
punches thrown even if they were from, you

220
00:20:06,385 --> 00:20:11,808
know, a 70 year old grandma. Story wise, there
wasn't too much here. Basically, Echo goes

221
00:20:11,828 --> 00:20:16,972
to her hometown in Oklahoma in an attempt to
stage a coup over Kingpin's empire, but ends

222
00:20:17,032 --> 00:20:22,556
up rediscovering her roots. It's surprising
to me that this show was initially shot as

223
00:20:22,576 --> 00:20:27,739
an eight episode release that was later pared
down to five episodes. And honestly, thank

224
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:32,203
God. But I think that they could have taken
that even further and this probably should

225
00:20:32,223 --> 00:20:37,602
have been a Disney Plus film or a Marvel Studios
special presentation. I think that runtime

226
00:20:37,722 --> 00:20:41,823
would have served the story a little bit better
that they had here and it would have moved

227
00:20:41,883 --> 00:20:48,025
at a quicker clip and been more enjoyable overall.
I don't know if I agree with that. I think

228
00:20:48,245 --> 00:20:55,607
Maya's mission to take down Kinkpin and become
the new Queenpin of New York City crime required

229
00:20:55,707 --> 00:21:01,448
a lot more story than what they gave us here.
This was a very small story. I don't understand

230
00:21:01,488 --> 00:21:06,262
how she was trying to take down Kinkpin from
fucking Oklahoma. Like they should have had

231
00:21:06,282 --> 00:21:11,085
her travel to New York City, meet people there,
you know, work the criminal underground from

232
00:21:11,365 --> 00:21:16,268
the city. I don't know. It was just weird. That
would have been a better concept. Of course,

233
00:21:16,328 --> 00:21:20,470
it would have gone against, you know, the whole
returning to your roots story that they were

234
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:24,532
telling here. Sure. But yeah, I think either
this could have been an eight episode series,

235
00:21:24,692 --> 00:21:28,255
like what you were describing or it could have
been a film for the existing story that they

236
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:33,337
had. Yeah, yeah, I agree. One of the other things
I enjoyed about the show was the cultural representation.

237
00:21:34,034 --> 00:21:39,139
It's not often that a superhero has such strong
ties to their cultural identity, but it's always

238
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:44,304
fascinating to see such as in films like Black
Panther or Shang-Chi. And here we got a great

239
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:48,608
glimpse into the Choctaw Nation. Although I
think they could have delved even deeper into

240
00:21:48,648 --> 00:21:52,932
that. You know, I think the exploration that
we got of the Choctaw was only surface level.

241
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:58,017
Yeah, I probably would have thought that this
was a great exploration of the Choctaw Nation.

242
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:03,331
If I hadn't just watched Killers of the Flower
Moon like less than a week prior and their

243
00:22:03,431 --> 00:22:08,212
examination of the Osage Indians who also lived
in Oklahoma. They even had some of the same

244
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:13,574
cast members for Echo as they did in Killers
of the Flower Moon and Killers of the Flower

245
00:22:13,614 --> 00:22:19,056
Moon was way better. I have to check that out.
I always like Scorsese stuff. So what was interesting

246
00:22:19,116 --> 00:22:22,717
here though is that not only did we get the
Native American cultural representation, we

247
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:26,954
also got a great crash course in American Sign
Language. I mean, I've never seen a project,

248
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:32,497
film or television. I never got around to seeing
Coda where so much of the dialogue was done

249
00:22:32,537 --> 00:22:37,720
with signing. And I thought that was fantastic
and truly fascinating to watch. And the cast

250
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,803
did great, not only with the ASL, but with everything.
You know, there aren't too many opportunities,

251
00:22:42,843 --> 00:22:47,585
it seems, for Native American roles. And it's
great to see how much talent there is within

252
00:22:47,605 --> 00:22:53,013
their group. from old greats like Graham Greene
to some slightly familiar faces like Julia

253
00:22:53,033 --> 00:22:58,318
Jones and enjoyable relative newcomers like
Cody Lightning who played Cousin Biscuits.

254
00:22:58,838 --> 00:23:03,462
Yeah, I know how to sign bullshit in sign language
now. It's dangerously close to I love you.

255
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:07,726
Yeah, if you mumble with your signing, you could
end up either way in a lot of trouble. Ha ha

256
00:23:08,967 --> 00:23:13,591
ha. But speaking of the actors, let's go ahead
and get into the character breakdown. Only

257
00:23:13,671 --> 00:23:19,166
two major roles to talk about and one of them
is of course Echo. aka Maya Lopez played by

258
00:23:19,306 --> 00:23:25,469
Alaka Cox. I wanna start off by saying that
Alaka Cox is an inspiration as an action hero.

259
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,432
I think that the physical choreography and the
stunts she's performed are incredible, not

260
00:23:30,512 --> 00:23:36,014
even accounting for her missing leg and inability
to hear. When you do account for those things,

261
00:23:36,154 --> 00:23:41,197
it's even more amazing what she's accomplished.
I don't want anything negative I say about

262
00:23:41,237 --> 00:23:46,879
the show to discount how truly... in awe I am
of her skill and like I hate being this douche

263
00:23:46,939 --> 00:23:51,622
hurling criticism from an armchair when she's
out there literally winning as a one-legged

264
00:23:51,662 --> 00:23:57,825
woman in an ass-kicking contest. On one hand,
this version of Echo is so different from the

265
00:23:57,865 --> 00:24:03,268
comic book character who's like this sophisticated
elegant socialite. And on the other hand, I

266
00:24:03,288 --> 00:24:07,811
couldn't possibly imagine there is a better
person out there to play Maya Lopez than Iloquo

267
00:24:07,831 --> 00:24:10,232
Cox. And I think really Iloquo

268
00:24:13,526 --> 00:24:17,709
It's the show writers who don't really seem
to know the Kong book character, painting her

269
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:23,434
here as this gritty, unlikable, brash, hard
ass with an entirely different power set from

270
00:24:23,474 --> 00:24:28,258
the source material. It's like the writers never
even read the comics. Yeah, I remember you

271
00:24:28,338 --> 00:24:33,822
mentioning that she is essentially like Taskmaster.
And, you know, I was telling my wife that as

272
00:24:33,842 --> 00:24:37,986
we were watching the show together, just explaining
how different this character is in the comics,

273
00:24:38,406 --> 00:24:43,614
about how she's just able to see someone move
or do martial arts. and then she's able to

274
00:24:43,814 --> 00:24:48,595
echo it or mimic it right off the bat. Right.
Yeah, that's why she has her name Echo in the

275
00:24:48,635 --> 00:24:54,337
comic books. She has photographic reflexes like
Taskmaster, but she also has heightened visual

276
00:24:54,377 --> 00:24:59,418
acuity like Cassandra Cain from DC Comics. It's
fascinating. And we kind of got a glimpse of

277
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:04,700
those abilities in Hawkeye Season One, where
she was able to anticipate her opponents moves.

278
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:10,861
But here the writers decided to forgo all that
and give her powers that tie into her Native

279
00:25:10,901 --> 00:25:16,291
American ancestry. Which is also cool. Like
that was interesting and how like she was able

280
00:25:16,331 --> 00:25:22,472
to like call on the talents of her ancestors.
But also I didn't get the healing thing. Like

281
00:25:22,532 --> 00:25:27,774
was her mama mutant or some shit? Yeah, it's
weird. I think it was all spiritual mystical

282
00:25:27,814 --> 00:25:33,776
based abilities. And there was a time in the
comic books when Echo had actual superpowers

283
00:25:33,816 --> 00:25:37,757
when she was the host of the Phoenix Force.
And I mentioned that in our question versus

284
00:25:37,877 --> 00:25:41,706
Echo dual episode that I didn't think those
powers would stick. and I was right because

285
00:25:41,726 --> 00:25:46,829
she ended up exhausting her Phoenix Force powers
while trying to save the multiverse. So I don't

286
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:51,511
know if her ancestral powers were supposed to
kind of tap into that aspect of her abilities

287
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:55,894
from the comics, or if they were just kind of,
you know, running fast and loose with the idea

288
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:59,996
of the character. Does it bother you that they
were? I mean, the character is somewhat obscure

289
00:26:00,036 --> 00:26:04,979
in the comics. I hate it when the writers don't
really adhere to the source material, because

290
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:09,201
then at that point it becomes a character that
I don't recognize. Now sometimes they have

291
00:26:09,241 --> 00:26:14,257
good ideas. but every good idea should have
some semblance to the source material I think.

292
00:26:14,538 --> 00:26:19,903
I agree. Otherwise, just make an original character.
Right, like they did with Kihori in Marvel's

293
00:26:19,943 --> 00:26:25,849
What If, who was fantastic. This series portrayed
Echo as power hungry but without providing

294
00:26:25,889 --> 00:26:31,155
clear motivations as to why she would want to
rule New York's crime empire, or how she would

295
00:26:31,195 --> 00:26:36,103
achieve that besides blowing up a weapons facility.
You know, in the show, Maya said that her enemies

296
00:26:36,143 --> 00:26:40,487
were playing right into her plan, but it's unclear
what that plan was gonna be. You know, she

297
00:26:40,587 --> 00:26:45,652
obviously thought that she could take on all
of New York from the middle of nowhere Oklahoma,

298
00:26:46,132 --> 00:26:50,576
but I never once believed that she'd be able
to achieve that as an audience member. Honestly,

299
00:26:50,797 --> 00:26:57,402
I never really believed anything about the character.
You haven't really mentioned her acting ability,

300
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:02,538
but I'll be the one to say it. She's not the
best actress. She's a better action star than

301
00:27:02,578 --> 00:27:07,019
she is an actress. Absolutely. I mean, there
were times where I thought she actually did

302
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:11,961
pretty well in her emotional scenes. But yeah,
overall, I think she's still growing as an

303
00:27:12,021 --> 00:27:18,022
actress. Yeah, I think her emotions were for
the majority of it, a little to one note. It

304
00:27:18,042 --> 00:27:22,984
was always anger all the time. I actually really
liked it when she was a bit more expressive.

305
00:27:23,584 --> 00:27:27,885
Yeah, for sure. A little bit one note. She always
just came off as prickly and it doesn't make

306
00:27:27,905 --> 00:27:32,235
for the most endearing protagonist. For her
arc, you know, instead of rising to power over

307
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:36,837
the criminal underworld, she instead discovered
how much her family meant to her, and that

308
00:27:36,877 --> 00:27:42,020
her mom and her ancestors were always watching
over her. She healed from the pain of losing

309
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:47,163
her family, and instead by the end embraces
her relatives, heritage, and her lineage. Now

310
00:27:47,183 --> 00:27:51,245
finding strength in your roots and in those
who love you is not a new theme in the world

311
00:27:51,265 --> 00:27:55,608
of superheroes. In fact, it's pretty common,
but I will say that at least we get the novelty

312
00:27:55,648 --> 00:28:00,706
of seeing it represented in this way with the
Choctaw Nation. Where have we seen this before?

313
00:28:01,147 --> 00:28:06,551
Dude, strength in family is such a common theme
in superhero movies. Like, take for instance

314
00:28:06,571 --> 00:28:10,714
recently Blue Beetle. Yeah. I would even say
Guardians of the Galaxy has strong familial

315
00:28:10,754 --> 00:28:15,557
themes. Okay, I mean, that's fair. But like,
roots is different from family, I would say.

316
00:28:15,597 --> 00:28:20,200
Like, culture is different from family. Like,
gathering strength from that, I think, actually

317
00:28:20,441 --> 00:28:25,985
makes Echo unique. That's true. I mean, it's
not that unique, given, you know, things like

318
00:28:26,025 --> 00:28:31,051
Shang-Chi and Black Panther. But it's unique
for this specific culture, which is nice. That's

319
00:28:31,091 --> 00:28:36,114
fair. Let's go to move on to Kingpin, a.k.a.
Wilson Fisk, once again, played by Vincent

320
00:28:36,154 --> 00:28:42,196
D'Onofrio. You know, he was flawless, obviously.
It was really good to see a return to form

321
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:46,939
after the slightly more cartoony take on Kingpin
that we saw in the Hawkeye television series.

322
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:53,882
Dude, I was so happy with Kingpin in the show.
I was like, hell yeah, bro. Hell yeah. Yeah,

323
00:28:53,902 --> 00:28:59,184
I remember you complaining a lot about the character
in our review of Hawkeye season one. So, yeah,

324
00:28:59,304 --> 00:29:03,947
it's good that he's back to being a gruff, terrifying
presence who often comes across as just this

325
00:29:04,047 --> 00:29:10,170
powder keg of a man just waiting to explode
and unleash his clearly unhinged palpable rage.

326
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:14,893
Yeah, like totally unpredictable. You just never
know when the guy is going to snap and it's

327
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:20,255
terrifying when he does. Yeah. For me, Vincent
D'Onafrio nearly saves this show. His presence

328
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:25,476
was so welcome when he did finally show up at
the end of episode three, and he elevated things,

329
00:29:25,636 --> 00:29:31,298
I think, when he came aboard. Oh, dude, he is
so fantastic in the role. He's Marvel's best

330
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:35,459
villain, in my opinion. Hands down. He's up
there, for sure. In this series, we see Kingpin's

331
00:29:35,499 --> 00:29:40,400
reaction to Echo's betrayal from the Hawkeye
Show. You know, there are only so many people

332
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,050
that Kingpin extends any measure of grace or
forgiveness to, and those are the... rare people

333
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:51,573
that he loves. Vanessa, his wife, would be one
person. Maya is another. So when he gave her

334
00:29:51,713 --> 00:29:56,955
that second chance as a comic fan, it was almost
unbelievable to witness the opportunity he

335
00:29:56,976 --> 00:30:02,638
was extending her. And it was exciting knowing
that after Maya's refusal of his generous offer,

336
00:30:03,098 --> 00:30:08,261
that shit was just gonna hit the fan. Like I
was on the edge of my seat at the end of episode

337
00:30:08,301 --> 00:30:14,544
four. But. That anticipation just kind of fizzled
by the end of the show and you know, Kingpin

338
00:30:14,764 --> 00:30:20,347
seemingly gets neutered of his unbridled rage.
Yeah, what the hell was that? He was like,

339
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:25,530
what did you do to me? What did you do to me?
And I was like, what did you do to him? I don't

340
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:31,173
even know. I'm confused. Answer the question.
The show never does. You know, and that's a

341
00:30:31,213 --> 00:30:35,476
disappointment, but we'll have to see where
that goes in Daredevil Born Again, where apparently

342
00:30:35,516 --> 00:30:41,260
in that series, based on the after credit scene
here. he'll become the mayor of New York. I'm

343
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:46,224
excited to see that. Yeah, that's a fantastic
setup. Definitely got me excited, even more

344
00:30:46,264 --> 00:30:51,128
excited for the Daredevil show. That was a great
arc in the comics and I hope they do it justice.

345
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:56,292
Everyone else on the show, they were fantastic,
but they really only had minor roles. So let's

346
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,213
go ahead and get into our episode highlights.

347
00:31:05,422 --> 00:31:11,203
Episode 1 was called Chaffa. At the dawn of
time, a woman named Chaffa emerges from a cave

348
00:31:11,363 --> 00:31:15,884
as she and her people become the first of the
Choctaw Native American tribe. In present-day

349
00:31:15,984 --> 00:31:21,186
Oklahoma, young Maya and her mother Taloa get
into an auto accident when their truck's brake

350
00:31:21,206 --> 00:31:27,167
lines are cut by criminals looking to kill Maya's
father, William. Taloa dies and Maya loses

351
00:31:27,207 --> 00:31:32,069
her leg, prompting William to move Maya away
with him to New York where he works for the

352
00:31:32,109 --> 00:31:37,699
kingpin who becomes Maya's adoptive uncle. William
leads the tracksuit mafia who is wiped out

353
00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:43,621
by Hawkeye, aka Ronan at the time, and Maya's
father dies in her arms. After learning Kingpin

354
00:31:43,701 --> 00:31:48,623
tipped off Ronan, she shoots Kingpin in the
face and escapes to Oklahoma to her childhood

355
00:31:48,663 --> 00:31:53,585
home where she meets with her cousin Biscuits
and her uncle Henry, the latter of whom she

356
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:59,528
asks for help in taking over Kingpin's empire.
In the end, it's revealed Kingpin survived

357
00:31:59,608 --> 00:32:05,042
the shooting. I thought the opening to the series
was fantastic. It's actually probably the best

358
00:32:05,062 --> 00:32:10,684
part of the show where we see the Choctaw Nation
rise from their cave onto the earth. How fascinating

359
00:32:10,724 --> 00:32:16,327
was that? A great, incredible depiction of mythology.
Yeah, it was pretty cool. I thought it was

360
00:32:16,447 --> 00:32:21,028
a great visual for sure. But not just that opening,
I thought this whole first episode was actually

361
00:32:21,068 --> 00:32:26,211
pretty solid. Dude, it had the Daredevil fight,
which was excellent. Yeah, I saw a clip of

362
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:31,293
the fight in advance of watching the series,
and I thought the choreography actually moved

363
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:37,576
a little bit over rehearsed and slow. But seeing
it in context of that larger one shot framing,

364
00:32:38,036 --> 00:32:41,958
I thought it was incredible. I was so happy
seeing that instead of the shitty, you know,

365
00:32:42,078 --> 00:32:47,922
yellow mustard costume that we saw in She-Hulk.
Yeah, the stunt actor who played Daredevil,

366
00:32:47,962 --> 00:32:51,564
I mean, Charlie Cox was great in the few lines
that he delivered, but I got to commend the

367
00:32:51,584 --> 00:32:55,766
Daredevil stunt guy. The way he moves feels
very Daredevil to me. It was like seeing the

368
00:32:55,786 --> 00:33:00,429
character leap right off the page. Yeah, the
way he leaped over the fence. Damn, that was

369
00:33:00,469 --> 00:33:04,477
cool. That was sick. It was so cool to have
Daredevil and Hawkeye in the same episode.

370
00:33:04,777 --> 00:33:09,322
Like I know we saw Matt Murdock in Spider-Man,
No Way Home, and that was cool. But to see

371
00:33:09,342 --> 00:33:13,266
the character in costume and then we have, you
know, Hawkeye in the Ronin costume and stuff

372
00:33:13,286 --> 00:33:17,931
like that, it just feels like the universe is
coalescing in a way that's so exciting as a

373
00:33:17,991 --> 00:33:21,895
Marvel fan. You don't know how freaking lucky
you are that the Netflix shows are a part of

374
00:33:21,935 --> 00:33:26,943
the MCU now. Man, that's, that's really cool.
It was apparent even from this first episode

375
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:31,006
though that there were some editing issues,
like there was a lot of stuff cut out, because

376
00:33:31,146 --> 00:33:35,209
later on in the episode I remember just thinking
like, who the fuck is Biscuits? Who the hell

377
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:40,493
is this guy? Like, they name drop the character
in one line early in the episode where they're

378
00:33:40,513 --> 00:33:43,916
like, Biscuits is gonna be mad he didn't get
to camp with the girls or something like that,

379
00:33:44,176 --> 00:33:47,478
but it was so throwaway. They presented the
character like we were supposed to know who

380
00:33:47,518 --> 00:33:52,186
he was, and maybe, you know, in a different
cut of this show we were supposed to. Yeah,

381
00:33:52,306 --> 00:33:57,007
I felt the same way. I didn't even get the name
drop earlier on. I was just like, who the fuck

382
00:33:57,067 --> 00:34:04,309
is Biscuits? Okay. Episode 2 was called LOWAK.
In 13th century Alabama, a woman named LOWAK

383
00:34:04,349 --> 00:34:09,410
competes in a game of Choctaw Stickball and
manifests strength from a vision of Chaffa

384
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:14,832
to win the game for her team. In the present
day, Maya gets Biscuits to follow her as she

385
00:34:14,872 --> 00:34:20,213
boards one of Kingpin's cargo trains. Finding
the munitions cart, she plants a homemade bomb

386
00:34:20,253 --> 00:34:25,148
inside. As she attempts to flee, her leg gets
stuck in one of the train's couplings, at which

387
00:34:25,208 --> 00:34:29,732
point she experiences a vision of Chafa and
Loic before summoning the strength to free

388
00:34:29,752 --> 00:34:35,015
herself. The bomb explodes as the train reaches
its destination in New York, destroying one

389
00:34:35,035 --> 00:34:40,339
of Kinkman's weapons facilities. Maya gets her
grandmother's ex, Scully, to fashion her a

390
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:44,982
new leg, and her uncle Henry warns her that
her actions are going to get the people close

391
00:34:45,002 --> 00:34:50,462
to her killed. Frustrated, she fires her gun
at a swing set in a fit of emotion. You know

392
00:34:50,482 --> 00:34:53,586
what that scene reminded me of when she just
started shooting the swing set and then the

393
00:34:53,626 --> 00:35:00,093
episode ended? It reminded me of a scene in
Hot Fuzz where Nick Frost asks Simon Pegg,

394
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:04,759
have you ever like shot your gun in the air
and gone, ah, like Keanu Reeves did in Point

395
00:35:04,799 --> 00:35:10,326
Break? And he's like, no, I've never shot my
gun in the air and gone, ah. You know. Just

396
00:35:10,386 --> 00:35:14,607
firing your weapon as a display of emotion.
I always thought it was incredibly cheesy.

397
00:35:14,647 --> 00:35:18,928
I don't know why she was shooting her swing
set. It was just really bizarre, lame way to

398
00:35:19,068 --> 00:35:25,110
end this episode. Now, is it just me or does
Choctaw's stick ball seem ridiculously hard?

399
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:33,892
Like lacrosse, but like impossible. I'm still
wondering how Maya's ancestor won. Like she

400
00:35:33,952 --> 00:35:39,538
just got a vision, did a flip. I didn't even
see the ball in her net stick thing. And I

401
00:35:39,558 --> 00:35:44,500
don't know. It was like, what just happened?
She got a vision. She got the ball. She did

402
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,842
a flip over the scrum and then ran into the
goal. I think that's what happened. Okay, that

403
00:35:49,862 --> 00:35:55,045
makes sense. What was interesting is when Maya's
powers manifested for the first time. Like

404
00:35:55,485 --> 00:36:00,187
out of all the times in her life that she's
endured like life threatening stakes, I wonder

405
00:36:00,207 --> 00:36:05,449
why her echo powers didn't come about then.
Maybe it was a proximity thing. I don't know,

406
00:36:05,549 --> 00:36:09,922
maybe. They gave some throwaway line like, oh,
the ancestors know when they're needed or something

407
00:36:09,942 --> 00:36:13,506
like that. But it's like, I'm pretty sure that
she could have used your help before. Like

408
00:36:13,587 --> 00:36:18,132
maybe when they were about to get hit by a car
or something as a kid. Oh, geez. Where were

409
00:36:18,152 --> 00:36:23,899
you then, ancestors? Damn. You know, what's
weird is that the stakes at the time when she

410
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:28,176
got her leg caught in the coupling. That wasn't
even life-threatening. She could have disconnected

411
00:36:28,216 --> 00:36:31,879
her leg at the time and just hopped off the
train to be picked up by biscuits. The way

412
00:36:31,919 --> 00:36:36,363
she got off the train was the most dangerous
way that she could have possibly done it by

413
00:36:36,423 --> 00:36:41,128
leaping off onto the truck, you know? It probably
would have been better to just kind of like

414
00:36:41,168 --> 00:36:45,632
tuck and roll as opposed to, you know, trying
this insane stunt. No, I'm still wondering

415
00:36:45,792 --> 00:36:51,257
how the frick that happened that like when he
slammed on his brakes, she didn't fly forward.

416
00:36:51,754 --> 00:36:55,917
Like when he came to the back and was like,
am I am I she just appeared behind the truck?

417
00:36:56,357 --> 00:37:02,161
And I was like, how? When? What? That's a great
question. I have no idea. She was just like,

418
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:07,205
ta da. I was like, all right, bullshit. But
OK. I do have to mention one character that

419
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:11,608
you didn't break down Uncle Henry. I thought
he did a fantastic job. I'm not sure of the

420
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:16,852
actor's name, but he did a great job acting
and signing at the same time I noticed. I think

421
00:37:16,872 --> 00:37:22,244
he did better than anyone else in the series.
Yeah, Henry was played by Chas Spencer. I think

422
00:37:22,284 --> 00:37:27,308
you're right. It was hard for me to get a grasp
on Uncle Henry, honestly, because it was clear

423
00:37:27,428 --> 00:37:31,912
that he cared for Maya, although he really disliked
the way she was going about everything. And,

424
00:37:32,012 --> 00:37:35,174
you know, he was really the voice of reason
throughout the show, which was interesting

425
00:37:35,214 --> 00:37:39,618
considering he was a career criminal. But absolutely,
I agree with everything you just said. His

426
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:45,383
ability to emote through his signing was kind
of a sight to behold. Yeah, I thought the same

427
00:37:45,403 --> 00:37:50,895
thing. Moving on to episode three, which was
called Too-Clo. In the late 19th century, a

428
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:55,659
woman named Tuklo saves her father and other
members of the light horsemen native police

429
00:37:55,699 --> 00:38:00,964
force from a band of outlaws by using exceptional
marksmanship skills granted by visions of her

430
00:38:01,064 --> 00:38:07,129
ancestors, Chaffa and Loek. In the present day,
Maya begins seeing visions as well and is kidnapped

431
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:12,353
by one of her Uncle Henry's employees named
Vicky. He calls in Kingpin's men in an attempt

432
00:38:12,393 --> 00:38:17,774
to collect the bounty on Maya's head and also
captures Henry and Maya's cousin Bonnie. When

433
00:38:17,814 --> 00:38:22,556
the Kingpin's men arrive, Maya escapes confinement
and attacks them, though they get the upper

434
00:38:22,616 --> 00:38:28,319
hand in the end by holding Bonnie hostage. Before
Maya's execution, the Kingpin's men get a call

435
00:38:28,399 --> 00:38:33,482
telling them to leave her alive, and they leave.
Returning home, Maya is approached by the Kingpin,

436
00:38:33,902 --> 00:38:40,985
who reveals that he's still alive. Dude, talk
about Deus Ex Machina. That was like, I hated

437
00:38:41,025 --> 00:38:45,847
that. It kind of ruins the entire stakes of
the fight that you just witnessed, right? I

438
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:50,288
mean, that was a great action scene, I thought,
at least in the beginning. But when she started

439
00:38:50,308 --> 00:38:56,090
to like using the arcade shooter guns as whips
and throwing skee balls at everybody, I was

440
00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:01,992
like, hmm, maybe not. But other than that, I
thought the action fight was spectacular. I

441
00:39:02,032 --> 00:39:05,573
really like the choreography. I really like
the camera work. It was just really well done.

442
00:39:06,073 --> 00:39:10,511
I liked the booby traps she set up. I don't
get like some of the devices that she was able

443
00:39:10,631 --> 00:39:16,134
to make, like that gun that she made. Oh, yeah,
that was stupid. I was like, what? How? How

444
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:21,517
did you make that fast? She was channeling the
abilities of a fellow Native American superhero,

445
00:39:21,657 --> 00:39:27,801
Forge. Oh, nice. Yeah, you didn't know that.
He's one of her ancestors is part of her abilities.

446
00:39:27,821 --> 00:39:32,884
No, yeah, that was weird. I don't understand
how you can make a bearing shooting device

447
00:39:33,004 --> 00:39:38,003
out of a roller skate. Just doesn't seem possible.
Yeah. This is the episode where she got the

448
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:43,147
special shin guard by Scully. I thought Scully
was going to include something special, like

449
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:48,292
a secret gadget or something within the shin
guard. But that never really amounted to anything

450
00:39:48,432 --> 00:39:52,736
within the rest of the series. They certainly
made it seem important, but it ended up not

451
00:39:52,776 --> 00:39:57,960
meaning much outside of its cultural representation.
I was thinking the same thing. Like they had

452
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:04,125
the perfect opportunity to make Scully Maya's
Q as it were, like, you know, her gadget guy.

453
00:40:04,746 --> 00:40:08,254
I'm really surprised they didn't follow through
with that. Yeah, that would have been cool.

454
00:40:08,695 --> 00:40:13,246
That's what I was expecting. He was even like,
oh, I need time to work on this. Well, what

455
00:40:13,326 --> 00:40:13,747
for?

456
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:22,072
I have no idea. You need to put some like, I
don't know, tear gas spray cartridges in there.

457
00:40:22,192 --> 00:40:27,454
Something cool. Yeah, a knife or something.
At the very least, a knife. She already has

458
00:40:27,574 --> 00:40:32,837
one in her shoe. Put one in her shin guard.
There you go. Episode four was called Taloa.

459
00:40:33,537 --> 00:40:39,620
In 2008, Kingpin brutally beats an ice cream
vendor for mocking Maya for being deaf, an

460
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,427
act that she witnesses and participates in by
kicking him. In 2021. Kingpin offers a final

461
00:40:45,467 --> 00:40:50,110
lesson to Maya for working for him, that they
can only trust each other and has his American

462
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:55,675
sign language interpreter killed. In the present,
Kingpin uses augmented reality tech to communicate

463
00:40:55,695 --> 00:41:00,519
with Maya and tell her that if she returns to
him in New York, he will give her his criminal

464
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:06,084
empire. He gives her a day to decide before
leaving, and Maya is taken to visit her grandmother

465
00:41:06,144 --> 00:41:11,788
Chula. There, Chula reveals that their ancestors,
which can be traced back to Chafa, help their

466
00:41:11,808 --> 00:41:17,356
family when they need it the most. echoing through
the generations. Maya leaves in anger, however,

467
00:41:17,396 --> 00:41:22,640
due to feeling abandoned as a child. Chula then
begins working on a special garment for Maya.

468
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:28,024
Maya visits Kingpin with the intent to kill
him, which he encourages just as he killed

469
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:33,047
his father. He asks Maya again to come back
to New York, but she ends up fleeing Tamaha

470
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:38,431
and raging him. I thought this was another great
flashback intro. The intros were actually some

471
00:41:38,471 --> 00:41:43,194
of my favorite parts of this season. Every episode
began with a flashback. Yeah, yeah, that was

472
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:49,136
cool. It kind of gave some insight as to why
Kingpin took a liking to Maya in that she kind

473
00:41:49,176 --> 00:41:54,537
of displayed a little bit of his same anger
and brutality towards that ice cream guy. Yeah,

474
00:41:54,837 --> 00:42:00,499
the whole sign language interpretation technology,
I thought, was kind of interesting in concept,

475
00:42:00,539 --> 00:42:07,101
but totally unnecessary given that Maya can
read lips. Can't she? Like, I wasn't sure if

476
00:42:07,121 --> 00:42:11,703
she could throughout this entire series. Well,
she's supposed to be able to, like that's her

477
00:42:11,763 --> 00:42:17,106
whole freaking power in the comic books. You
know, she has incredible visual acuity. So

478
00:42:17,306 --> 00:42:23,350
really all Kingpin would need was some kind
of tech that could interpret ASL. She wouldn't

479
00:42:23,370 --> 00:42:28,873
really need the contact lens. Yeah, he could
put the contact in his own damn eye. Yeah,

480
00:42:28,893 --> 00:42:33,936
just replace his eyeball. Exactly. Although
I think it was maybe insinuating that the contact

481
00:42:33,976 --> 00:42:38,267
lens was also a tracker. I don't know. What
I do want to know though is why didn't she

482
00:42:38,327 --> 00:42:42,690
kill Kingpin at the end of this episode when
he gave her the opportunity? Is it because

483
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:48,174
she had a change of heart on wanting him dead
or something? But like if so, why? Because

484
00:42:48,254 --> 00:42:53,778
he was kind of family and you know some part
of her didn't want to betray his trust, I guess?

485
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:57,700
But she was gonna betray his trust by fleeing,
you know? If she didn't want to betray his

486
00:42:57,761 --> 00:43:02,424
trust, take him up on his offer and rule the
criminal underworld out of sight as the Queenpin.

487
00:43:02,544 --> 00:43:07,463
Just a bizarre series of choices that she made
here. Yeah, I mean, but I think it was just

488
00:43:07,503 --> 00:43:12,827
kind of hinting at her heroic streak in a way
that she realized that she didn't have it in

489
00:43:12,887 --> 00:43:17,830
her to kill him. I guess, I don't know, because
she's definitely killed before. She's a complicated

490
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:22,353
character. Yeah, at that point, it kind of became
clear that she doesn't really know what she

491
00:43:22,413 --> 00:43:27,917
wants. And the whole journey that she goes through
in the series is basically figuring that out

492
00:43:27,957 --> 00:43:34,474
for herself. Right, yeah. Episode five was called
Maya. In a flashback to Maya's childhood, She

493
00:43:34,514 --> 00:43:39,036
witnesses her mother use her healing powers
to mend a woodpecker that she had injured with

494
00:43:39,056 --> 00:43:43,858
a slingshot. In the present, Biscuits reaches
out to Maya to tell her that Chula and Bonnie

495
00:43:43,898 --> 00:43:49,781
are missing, prompting Maya to return to Tamaha.
At her grandmother's house, she sees a vision

496
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:55,243
of her mom, Taloa, who tells Maya that she's
the descendant of a long line of special women

497
00:43:55,643 --> 00:44:01,370
dating back to Chafa, and that she's never alone
before healing Maya's heart of her pain. Maya

498
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:06,631
dons the outfit her grandmother created before
going to the Choctaw Powwow Festival and participates

499
00:44:06,671 --> 00:44:12,353
in it to avoid Kingpin's men while looking for
her family. A woodpecker guides Maya to a barn

500
00:44:12,413 --> 00:44:17,935
where she finds Kingpin with Chula and Bonnie
held captive. Summoning the power of her ancestors,

501
00:44:18,095 --> 00:44:23,416
Maya shares her powers with her family and they
join together to fight Kingpin's men. She takes

502
00:44:23,456 --> 00:44:29,498
Kingpin back to a memory of his childhood and
heals his pain. Enraged, He asks her what she

503
00:44:29,518 --> 00:44:34,759
did to him, then flees as the police arrive.
The next day, Maya visits her family before

504
00:44:34,799 --> 00:44:40,361
leaving Tamaha. In a post-credit scene, Kingpin
watches with interest a news report on the

505
00:44:40,401 --> 00:44:46,963
New York mayoral election. So I have a question.
Yeah? Did Maya forget about her mom's superpower,

506
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:52,525
like as she grew up? I feel like if I saw my
mom perform a miracle like killing an injured

507
00:44:52,585 --> 00:44:57,870
bird, I would remember that shit. You know?
I almost feel like maybe that wasn't the first

508
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:02,633
time she saw her mom do that. Maybe that's why
she brought it to her mom. Because like, the

509
00:45:02,653 --> 00:45:06,775
little girl didn't seem surprised at all when
her mom displayed the power. She was like,

510
00:45:07,315 --> 00:45:13,359
Oh my gosh, what's happening? No. I also want
to know why didn't her mom, if she could visit

511
00:45:13,399 --> 00:45:19,190
her as a ghost, heal her pain from her traumatic
childhood sooner if she had that ability. Well,

512
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:24,033
maybe because she was finally getting full access
to her ancestors and maybe like her mom was

513
00:45:24,153 --> 00:45:28,836
the last one that she was able to gain access
to. Maybe that's the reason. There's a lot

514
00:45:28,876 --> 00:45:34,220
of assumptions that are going on here. Also,
I didn't know quite how to describe how Bonnie

515
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:39,203
and Chula got their abilities, whether or not
that was Maya sharing it with them or if they

516
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:43,986
also have the ability to tap into the power
of their ancestors. That was unclear. Well,

517
00:45:44,006 --> 00:45:50,042
they have the same ancestors. So I figured that
was the reason why. So basically you have a

518
00:45:50,082 --> 00:45:56,788
whole line of Choctaw women who are superheroes.
Every woman is a superhero, Joseph. Every woman.

519
00:45:57,168 --> 00:46:02,232
Right, I forgot about that, sorry. The end fight
was horrible. Like I almost did a spit take

520
00:46:02,252 --> 00:46:09,317
when I saw Chula punching bad guys. And again,
I just really don't like the ambiguity regarding

521
00:46:09,378 --> 00:46:14,381
what happened to Kingpin. Like if he's cured
of his pain regarding his traumatic childhood.

522
00:46:14,786 --> 00:46:20,749
Does that mean that he's now without evil ambition?
If so, does that not contradict the look on

523
00:46:20,789 --> 00:46:26,032
his face when he's considering running for mayor?
Is he in fact going to be a good mayor? What's

524
00:46:26,052 --> 00:46:29,694
gonna happen there? Yeah, that's a fantastic
question. I guess we won't know the answer

525
00:46:29,714 --> 00:46:36,718
to that until Daredevil born again. But I do
think that her healing camp was the most anti-climactic

526
00:46:36,738 --> 00:46:42,754
shit I've ever seen in my life. For sure, yeah.
If Kingpin ends up still being like a a piece

527
00:46:42,794 --> 00:46:47,438
of shit dude in Daredevil Born Again. I'm going
to wonder what the hell happened here. Yeah,

528
00:46:47,478 --> 00:46:53,623
I guess Echo's powers are useless. Yeah, like
I'm unclear as to what exactly she heals, because

529
00:46:53,643 --> 00:46:59,228
like her mom healed the physical body of the
hummingbird. And I guess Echo physically healed

530
00:46:59,288 --> 00:47:05,053
Kingpin's eye. When you do it over the heart,
was it also psychological or spiritual or I

531
00:47:05,313 --> 00:47:10,337
don't know? I think it's emotional. I think
it's emotional healing. When I get that feeling.

532
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:18,103
I need a emotional healing. There you go. Emotional
healing. Yeah, we'll say the ending was quite

533
00:47:18,144 --> 00:47:22,585
as bad as the cop out that She-Hulk did, where,
you know, she broke the fourth wall and completely

534
00:47:22,665 --> 00:47:27,266
circumvented the entire conflict that whole
series was building toward. But this is still

535
00:47:27,286 --> 00:47:31,467
a pretty bad ending. So I guess the best thing
you can say about the show is that it's somewhat

536
00:47:31,507 --> 00:47:35,928
better than She-Hulk. Yeah. And that brings
us to, you know, my final rating. You know,

537
00:47:35,988 --> 00:47:42,435
we rated She-Hulk two stars. This was better
than that. I actually enjoyed Secret Invasion

538
00:47:42,535 --> 00:47:48,338
season 1 more than Echo, so I'm going in between
there. While Echo season 1 is a fascinating

539
00:47:48,418 --> 00:47:53,241
insight into several underrepresented groups,
the story is threadbare and the hero is just

540
00:47:53,321 --> 00:48:00,305
too one-dimensional for much enjoyment. So I'm
rating it 2.5 stars, a rotten rating on Rotten

541
00:48:00,325 --> 00:48:04,607
Tomatoes. Because at the end of the day, I don't
think I would recommend the show, I think you'll

542
00:48:04,627 --> 00:48:08,850
be disappointed by it no matter what type of
Marvel fan you are. Yeah I- I guess I would

543
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:13,993
agree. I think I liked it a little bit more
than you did, not by much though. Like I might

544
00:48:14,013 --> 00:48:19,736
be willing to give this three stars maybe, but
right around that ballpark. I think you hit

545
00:48:19,756 --> 00:48:24,579
the nail on the head early on in the review
when you said that you're not sure who will

546
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:30,062
be satisfied by a series like this. I think
ultimately the only reason to watch it is if

547
00:48:30,102 --> 00:48:34,744
you know, Echo ever joins the Avengers and you
want to find out how she got her cool new costume.

548
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:38,938
The costume was cool. I'll say that. But that
does it for this review. Let us know what you

549

to Madam Web that's coming near the end of

558
00:49:28,911 --> 00:49:36,640
February, we will be pitting Ultraman against
Hyperion. Yeah, Ultraman being the Earth three

559
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:42,404
version of Superman, who's basically an evil
version of Superman versus Hyperion, who is

560
00:49:42,464 --> 00:49:46,908
the leader of the Squadron Supreme, which is
basically like an authoritarian version of

561
00:49:46,928 --> 00:49:53,193
the Justice League in Marvel. So two evil, multiversal
Superman, who's gonna win? We're gonna find
