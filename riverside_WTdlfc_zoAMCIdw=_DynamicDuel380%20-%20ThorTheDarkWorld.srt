00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,957
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,846 --> 00:00:30,349
Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we
review superhero films and debate the superiority

3
00:00:30,389 --> 00:00:35,733
between Marvel and DC by comparing their characters
in stat-based battle simulations. I'm Johnny

4
00:00:35,773 --> 00:00:41,717
DC. And I'm his twin brother Marvelous Joe.
And in this episode, as a tie-in to our last

5
00:00:41,757 --> 00:00:47,341
episode, which was a duel between Eclipso and
Malekith, we are now doing a throwback review

6
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:53,205
to Thor the Dark World. Right, because Malekith
is the main villain of Thor the Dark World.

7
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:59,453
You know what? I'm just gonna say it now. It's
a good movie, guys. I'm sick of pretending

8
00:00:59,473 --> 00:01:04,958
like it's not. Alright? I never pretended like
it wasn't. I always thought it was pretty good.

9
00:01:05,098 --> 00:01:08,900
Especially compared to where the franchise has
gone now with Thor, Love and Thunder, you know?

10
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:12,583
I really wish the franchise would go back to
the tone of Thor the Dark World. And we'll

11
00:01:12,603 --> 00:01:17,107
talk more about the movie later on this episode.
But, you know, for the haters out there that

12
00:01:17,147 --> 00:01:20,809
may dislike this movie, try sticking around.
You might change your mind about the film.

13
00:01:21,174 --> 00:01:24,494
Before we review Thor the Dark World, we're
going to break down the comic book movie news

14
00:01:24,534 --> 00:01:30,176
from the past week, of which there is one news
item, an amazing news item, it was the official

15
00:01:30,236 --> 00:01:35,558
teaser trailer for Joker, Fall Ya Do, which
was released during CinemaCon this past week.

16
00:01:36,078 --> 00:01:40,379
I don't know if I would call it an amazing news
item so much as a news item, but as always

17
00:01:40,419 --> 00:01:44,660
we list our segment times in our episode description,
so feel free to check out our show notes if

18

19
00:01:50,014 --> 00:01:54,527

that might come out the next week, we'll see.

Also guys, check out the TV and movie trivia
podcast. where I did a guest spot with the

44
00:04:14,114 --> 00:04:20,297
host Brian over there on that show and I competed
in trivia regarding the movie X-Men First Class.

45
00:04:20,757 --> 00:04:25,840
So, if you're a fan of X-Men First Class and
of movie trivia and you think you know more

46
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,642
about that movie than I do, go see if you're
right by listening to the TV and movie trivia

47
00:04:30,682 --> 00:04:37,505
pod. But with that out of the way, quick to
the no prize! A no prize is an award Marvel

48
00:04:37,545 --> 00:04:42,266
used to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic
Duel No Prize, is a digital award we post on

49
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:47,608
Instagram for the person that we feel gave the
best answer to our question of the week. Last

50
00:04:47,668 --> 00:04:52,349
week we asked, what would be your favorite out
of left field casting choice for an alternate

51
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:58,651
universe Marvel or DC character? And this was
coming off the news that Julia Garner was cast

52
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:03,352
as the Silver Surfer in the upcoming Fantastic
Four movie. We got a lot of great answers,

53
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:07,646
so let's go ahead and break down our three honorable
mentions, as well as the No Prize winner. Our

54
00:05:07,686 --> 00:05:13,889
first honorable mention goes to Brandon Estergard,
who said, Hey guys, my out of left field casting

55
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:22,554
would be for Anya Taylor Joy to play Luke Cage,
not Lucille Cage, not Lucy Cage, Luke Cage.

56
00:05:23,134 --> 00:05:28,297
And right out of the gate with the left field
casting choice, Brandon gave us Anya Taylor

57
00:05:28,337 --> 00:05:33,880
Joy as Luke Cage. I don't know if she could
pull off the character that well, now that

58
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,146
I think about it. She could probably pull off
the yellow blouse. that he wore back in the

59
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:43,629
day. And the tiara. The tiara she called. And
the matching bracelets. Yeah, yeah, the bracelets,

60
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:48,492
maybe the chain link belt that he's got going
on, but I'd like to see her try it at the very

61
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:53,715
least. Yeah. I feel like there would be riots
if she did. She would get canceled so hard,

62
00:05:53,815 --> 00:06:00,398
so fast. She would, but I would still be interested
to see it. Brandon actually gave two answers.

63
00:06:00,638 --> 00:06:05,721
He also said that he would like to see Dwayne
the Rock Johnson play Starfire. He could pull

64
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:11,457
off the outfit. for sure. Yeah, if any guy could,
he could. But Brandon also said that he was

65
00:06:11,517 --> 00:06:16,620
especially looking forward to seeing the Rock
wear a Starfire wig, which I would also love

66
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:22,985
to see. Our next honorable mention goes to Jacob
Bell, who said, Hey, what's up, guys? Jacob

67
00:06:23,005 --> 00:06:26,787
Bell here. You guys know that I love casting
stuff. I'm super passionate about it. This

68
00:06:26,867 --> 00:06:31,010
one is definitely out of left field a little
bit, but just kind of hang in there with me.

69
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:38,755
But why can't Natalie Portman play the Joker?
The like Bruce Wayne's mom version of the Joker

70
00:06:38,795 --> 00:06:43,719
from the Flashpoint Paradox movie. She has an
Oscar. We know she can act. I like her in the

71
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,623
Thor movies. I think she's good and she's old
enough to play a mom. I just, I think it would

72
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:54,447
be awesome. Awesome casting. So when we first
heard that the Flash movie was going to take

73
00:06:54,487 --> 00:07:00,992
inspiration from the Flashpoint storyline in
the comics, all of us loved the idea of Jeffrey

74
00:07:01,012 --> 00:07:07,548
Dean Morgan and Lauren Cohen. playing the Flashpoint
versions of Batman and the Joker because of

75
00:07:07,588 --> 00:07:12,231
course in that universe Bruce Wayne's parents
become Batman and the Joker respectively. I

76
00:07:12,251 --> 00:07:17,854
thought Lauren Cohen would have made a fantastic
Joker but I also know that Natalie Portman

77
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:23,297
could knock it out of the park. The Joker seems
to be this role that good actors seem to thrive

78
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:29,180
in, Jared Leto notwithstanding. So as could
have been actress as Natalie Portman is, I'm

79
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,547
sure she would also do well in the role. Yeah,
in reference to this answer, I go back to the

80
00:07:34,607 --> 00:07:40,030
Natalie raps from Saturday Night Live and what
a crazy character she is there. I think that

81
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:44,653
could easily be transposed into the character
of the Joker. Absolutely. Our final honorable

82
00:07:44,693 --> 00:07:49,776
mention goes to Miggy Mattenkian, who said,
Hey, what's up guys, this is Miggy and my out

83
00:07:49,816 --> 00:07:55,619
of left field casting would be Rowan Atkinson
as Alfred Pennyworth. At first glance, this

84
00:07:55,699 --> 00:08:02,370
is like not a great casting because Mr. Bean,
you know, he's a very comedic actor. But he

85
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:07,672
actually had a role of Black Adder where he
was like the stuck-up like aristocrat. And

86
00:08:07,792 --> 00:08:13,153
I think that along with like a more serious
like Johnny English type, I think could work

87
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:18,675
really well for Alfred. So yeah, Rowan Atkinson,
popularly known as Mr. Bean. I think I've only

88
00:08:18,735 --> 00:08:23,996
ever seen him in comedic roles. But I feel like
he's a really good actor. And I think that

89
00:08:24,056 --> 00:08:28,966
a role like Alfred Pennyworth would really allow
him to bring that out. I mean, you could also

90
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:34,270
just have a comedic Alfred Pennyworth. Yeah,
I mean, to me, that's not as interesting as

91
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:39,814
just seeing Ron Atkinson going full on thespian
mode, you know? Yeah, full on Shakespeare mode,

92
00:08:40,114 --> 00:08:44,197
for sure. Yeah. I actually don't think this
is too far out of left field. Maybe in the

93
00:08:44,217 --> 00:08:47,919
sense that it would probably never happen, but
you know what? I think he would actually be

94
00:08:47,979 --> 00:08:51,942
well suited to the role if he was ever cast.
I don't think I would question it quite as

95
00:08:52,002 --> 00:08:58,538
much as say, you know, Anya Taylor Joy as Luke
Cage. No, no. I think you could do just as

96
00:08:58,578 --> 00:09:03,141
good a job as Andy Serkis for sure. Great answer,
Miggy. We want to give a special shout out

97
00:09:03,161 --> 00:09:10,345
to Colby Hentges, who said that Jonathan Majors
could play Icon. Yikes. Connor Pierce said

98
00:09:10,405 --> 00:09:16,508
that Kelly Rohrbach could play Power Girl and
Scott Camacho, whose favorite out of left field

99
00:09:16,528 --> 00:09:23,552
casting was actually Michael Keaton as Batman.
But the winner of this week's No Prize is Travis

100
00:09:23,572 --> 00:09:29,791
Bailey, who said. All right, Travis Bailey.
What's up to my twin? All right. Listen Joe's

101
00:09:29,912 --> 00:09:35,455
on to something. All right. She's an alternate
universe Silver surfer, right? So I'm gonna

102
00:09:35,475 --> 00:09:43,061
take you back to issue 12. What if what if Rick
James was the Hulk? All right. I take an AI

103
00:09:43,101 --> 00:09:49,765
generated Rick James, but follow me with this.
What if Britney Spears was the Hulk now she

104
00:09:49,805 --> 00:09:54,729
hawked the Hulk and you can have all the stuff
she got with her father as a All right, he

105
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:59,651
got cut off there, but I love this answer so
much. What if Rick James was the Hulk? Now,

106
00:09:59,912 --> 00:10:06,535
actually, the official what if issue 12 was
what if Rick Jones was the Hulk? But I googled

107
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:11,078
this and there was a parody of that issue that
said, what if Rick James was the Hulk? And

108
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:16,080
it's freaking hilarious. I love the idea of
this. Gamma radiation is a hell of a drug.

109
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:24,685
Instead of Hulk smash, you'd be like, give it
to me, baby. People would call him super freakish,

110
00:10:24,805 --> 00:10:29,797
for sure. But, uh, Britney Spears as the Hulk,
that's definitely inspired considering both

111
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:35,981
of the characters have, you know, daddy issues.
I totally see it. Yeah, I think she'd probably

112
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:42,185
shave her head and then go green and then just...
Act like her normal self. Just dancing with

113
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:46,528
knives and crazy shit. Jeez, I don't know if
the whole making fun of her shaving her head

114
00:10:46,568 --> 00:10:51,612
thing is a decade too late of a joke, but yeah,
we'll go with that. We'll go with that. So

115
00:10:51,652 --> 00:10:55,388
congrats to Travis Bailey for winning this week's
No Prize. If you the listener want to shout

116
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:59,274
out winning your own no prize, stay tuned to
later on this episode when we'll be asking

117
00:10:59,314 --> 00:11:03,401
another question of the week. And now that that's
done, on to the news!

118
00:11:08,886 --> 00:11:12,386
Alright, before we get into this I just want
you guys to know that Joseph super butthurt

119
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:17,288
about me not liking the casting of the Surfer
Surfer. So he's planning on shitting all over

120
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:20,929
this trailer, but he can do whatever he wants,
we don't care because we all know that this

121
00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:26,130
trailer was awesome. The trailer was released
last week during CinemaCon and there was quite

122
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:30,612
a bit of news to come out for both Marvel and
DC during this, including the Superman logo

123
00:11:30,952 --> 00:11:36,313
and some footage from the new Captain America
movie. But I think hands down, the biggest

124
00:11:36,353 --> 00:11:43,055
thing to come out. of the entire convention
was the official teaser trailer for Joker Folly-a-doo.

125
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:52,278
It was alright. When we first heard that this
was going to be a musical, some fans were up

126
00:11:52,298 --> 00:11:57,479
in ire. Again, I was not one of those until
I learned that it was going to be a jukebox

127
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,840
musical. I was actually very disappointed by
that. If you're not familiar with what a jukebox

128
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:08,094
musical is, it's a musical that has no original
music. It just rehashes pop music essentially.

129
00:12:08,555 --> 00:12:15,138
So I was pretty apprehensive going into this
trailer until I saw it and all of its beauty

130
00:12:15,158 --> 00:12:19,820
and all of its splendor. One of my favorite
trailers of all time was actually the first

131
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,902
trailer we got for the first Joker movie. And
this reminded me a lot of that. In fact, I

132
00:12:26,122 --> 00:12:31,685
would say I enjoyed this trailer more than that
first one. It captured all of the emotion,

133
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:38,143
but the cinematography here was just so unbelievably
gorgeous as well. Jonathan, why are you so

134
00:12:38,183 --> 00:12:42,405
wishy washy when it comes to this movie? What
are you talking about? First you like it, then

135
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:47,868
you hate the idea of it, then you like it again,
and then you're like, oh no, I don't wanna

136
00:12:47,888 --> 00:12:51,509
see it. And then you're like, okay, I love it
actually. Well, I was the same way with the

137
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:55,551
first Joker movie, honestly, like at first I
was like, ah, this is dumb. Why are they making

138
00:12:55,591 --> 00:12:59,613
a Joker origin story? No one wants this. Until
I saw the first trailer and I was totally sold,

139
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:06,041
this is the case again. We see the trailer start
off with Arthur Fleck in Arkham Asylum. He's

140
00:13:06,061 --> 00:13:11,106
being taken out of his jail cell by Brandon
Gleason, of all people. I don't even know he

141
00:13:11,126 --> 00:13:15,089
was in this movie, but he's, you know, a really
good actor. They take the character of Arthur

142
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:21,674
Fleck right past Lady Gaga's character, who
seems to be a patient at Arkham as well, which

143
00:13:21,735 --> 00:13:27,279
is really confusing because we know that Harley
Quinzel was actually a doctor at Arkham Asylum,

144
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:32,203
a psychologist who helped treat the Joker. Of
course, she doesn't stay there throughout the

145
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:37,686
trailer. We see her actually out and about in
the city of Gotham without the Joker. So I

146
00:13:37,786 --> 00:13:42,348
think she's actually manipulating Kim in this
trailer. That's my theory. Although I've heard

147
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:47,791
other theories that say she's not actually there.
He's just imagining her in the same way that

148
00:13:47,851 --> 00:13:53,615
Joker had a lot of hallucinations in the first
movie with Zazie Beats character. How she was

149
00:13:53,675 --> 00:13:58,417
always there supporting Kim when in fact she
really wasn't. It's hard to say what's real.

150
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:04,755
and what's fake, what's a part of Joker's imagination
in this movie. Because early on, we see him

151
00:14:04,795 --> 00:14:10,917
walking through the Arkham Courtyard and the
guards have these umbrellas that Arthur suddenly

152
00:14:11,077 --> 00:14:17,319
imagines very colorful. It's a really beautiful
scene, but also hints at the imaginary world

153
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:23,001
that Arthur is creating for himself. Once the
character of Harley invites the Joker out,

154
00:14:23,341 --> 00:14:28,139
as if maybe they're going to escape or just
go outside, That's when the music of the trailer

155
00:14:28,219 --> 00:14:34,542
really starts. We see both Joker and Harley
on the rooftop of Hotel Arkham. Apparently,

156
00:14:34,562 --> 00:14:39,005
they're imagining the scene. And they start
dancing, and it just segues into this moment

157
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:43,987
of chaos, where we see buildings burning down
and the background in ambulances and police

158
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:48,510
cars driving by. And Joker and Harley don't
seem to care. They're just enamored with each

159
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:53,573
other, just living life and loving music, it
seems. It's like the Joker dreamed of being

160
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:58,502
a comedian on stage. in the first movie, but
here it seems like he's fantasizing more about

161
00:14:58,562 --> 00:15:05,765
being a musician on stage, which kind of plays
into Todd Phillips' whole concept for the character

162
00:15:05,785 --> 00:15:10,126
of the Joker. You know, Todd Phillips has said
that he has music in his soul, which is why

163
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:14,307
he did this kind of dance the first time he
killed someone in the first movie. And it seems

164
00:15:14,327 --> 00:15:18,388
like this Harley Quinn is really playing up
on that. I'm really looking forward to see

165
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:23,542
how Harley fits into everything in this movie.
So you're looking forward to this movie? Would

166
00:15:23,582 --> 00:15:28,986
you say that the depiction of Harley and Joker's
relationship is accurate to the comic books?

167
00:15:29,547 --> 00:15:35,872
In a sense, I would say that if they're going
the route where Harley is trying to manipulate

168
00:15:35,892 --> 00:15:41,157
the Joker so that she can write a tell-all book,
that's accurate to the comics. That was straight

169
00:15:41,197 --> 00:15:46,261
out of Mad Love. I think, yeah, this will be
accurate for the most part, but it's still

170
00:15:46,301 --> 00:15:50,065
an interesting twist that I love that they're
making for this film. Because it makes the

171
00:15:50,085 --> 00:15:56,095
character of Harley... appear much more intelligent
in the way that she's able to manipulate Joker.

172
00:15:56,355 --> 00:16:00,796
Because oftentimes, you know, Harley Quinn is
the one who suffers from abuse and she's the

173
00:16:00,816 --> 00:16:05,817
one who's manipulated by Joker. But I think
in this film, we're actually going to see them

174
00:16:06,438 --> 00:16:12,019
sort of manipulate each other. That's sort of
my theory. Would you say the Joker is accurate

175
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:17,761
to the comics? The Joker is accurate to the
Joker film. I mean, this is a sequel. I think

176
00:16:18,021 --> 00:16:23,282
I think by the end of this film, the Joker is
going to Snap more than he's ever snapped before

177
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:29,124
and he's going to become the Joker of the comics
Okay, so but he's there's a lot of differences

178
00:16:29,184 --> 00:16:34,946
here in the Joker than how he is in the comics,
right? Definitely not as much as silver surfer

179
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:39,567
being a woman. I know where you're trying to
go But you're willing to accept these changes

180
00:16:39,587 --> 00:16:44,069
though, because it's like an elseworlds like
an alternate universe kind of you know Except

181
00:16:44,109 --> 00:16:49,731
the Fantastic Four movie is not an elseworlds
tale It's the MCU, and the first time you're

182
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:54,834
introducing a character, it shouldn't be an
alternate version of the character. You know,

183
00:16:55,014 --> 00:17:00,058
it's not like they genderbent Mr. Fantastic
when we first saw him in Doctor Strange and

184
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:04,360
the Multiverse of Madness. Sure, Captain America
has already been established as a man, so I

185
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,843
think it's okay genderbending him with Peggy
Carter, but it's a mistake to do that with

186
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:13,426
Silver Surfer. I don't even know why we're talking
about this and need to get over it. Moving

187
00:17:13,486 --> 00:17:18,708
back to the Joker Folio Do trailer. So it's
okay to make changes to alternate universes

188
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:25,231
from the comics. There's a line you don't cross
and the Fantastic Four crossed that line. I

189
00:17:25,311 --> 00:17:28,632
think the Joker crossed the line too. It was
just something you didn't want to accept until

190
00:17:28,652 --> 00:17:31,774
you actually saw the movie. And since you don't
actually know what your opinions are until

191
00:17:31,794 --> 00:17:35,195
you see things, and maybe even sometimes after
you see things, as is the case with the first

192
00:17:35,235 --> 00:17:41,606
Joker film, maybe you just don't know what you're
talking about. No, I think I do. Another thing

193
00:17:41,646 --> 00:17:47,130
that reminded me of the first Joker trailer
with this trailer was how he's speaking with

194
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:53,855
his therapist. Arthur Fleck was such a lonely
character in the first movie, so it makes sense

195
00:17:53,895 --> 00:17:59,679
that he could almost start to heal with the
emergence of Harley Quinn. And I think that's

196
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:05,242
really going to ultimately lead to his downfall
is that when he finds out that she's manipulating

197
00:18:05,302 --> 00:18:09,645
him, he's just going to snap. And I'm kind of
worried about what's going to happen with Harley.

198
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:14,872
Whatever happens in the film, it definitely
looks like Harley starts to lose her grip on

199
00:18:14,932 --> 00:18:19,194
reality in the same way that maybe the Joker
is in the fact that she's starting to smear

200
00:18:19,254 --> 00:18:25,536
blood on her face and do the whole makeup thing.
It gets pretty wild, but nothing is more wild

201
00:18:25,596 --> 00:18:31,819
and awesome than the final shot, the final scene
of this trailer, which you wouldn't think it

202
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:37,581
would be because it's essentially just Harley
drawing a smile with lipstick on a glass pane.

203
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:45,063
But the way it lined up with Joaquin Phoenix's
sinister smile just screamed Joker to me. It

204
00:18:45,083 --> 00:18:53,971
was so, so well shot. Like this entire film.
Holy cow. I also have to commend the people

205
00:18:53,991 --> 00:18:59,035
who made the trailer for their song choice of
Tom Jones, What the World Needs Now is Love.

206
00:18:59,295 --> 00:19:04,499
I think that's the name of the song. Perfect
choice. Love everything about this trailer.

207
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,895
Hopefully I'm going to love everything about
this movie. Because the first movie was really

208
00:19:08,915 --> 00:19:13,623
hard to watch and I'm sure this one will be
too, but I'm totally ready for it. Well Jonathan,

209
00:19:13,663 --> 00:19:18,330
I'm glad to see you admit that you shouldn't
judge things prematurely and maybe wait and

210
00:19:18,351 --> 00:19:22,377
see how they come out before basing your opinion.
And that brings us to our question of the week.

211
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:32,795

217
00:20:04,174 --> 00:20:07,659
But I think that does it for all the news from
this episode. Now let's move on to the main

218
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:13,609
event, where we review the 2013 MCU film, Thor,
The Dark World.

219
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:34,558
Okay, Thor the Dark World was released in 2013,
directed by Alan Taylor, and it stars Chris

220
00:20:34,598 --> 00:20:40,402
Hemsworth, Tom Hiddleston, Natalie Portman,
and Christopher Ecclestone. Right up top, I'm

221
00:20:40,422 --> 00:20:44,645
going to give you listeners your spoiler warning.
If you haven't seen Thor the Dark World yet,

222
00:20:45,306 --> 00:20:48,908
and you like the character of Thor, definitely
go give the movie a watch before listening

223
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:54,670
to this spoiler filled review. Now we haven't
reviewed the first Thor movie yet, but I thought

224
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,291
it was an interesting and successful way to
introduce the concept of magic and fantasy

225
00:20:58,331 --> 00:21:03,333
in the very science fiction-y world of the Marvel
Cinematic Universe at the time. I knew that

226
00:21:03,413 --> 00:21:07,914
a sequel of the first film was given after the
Avengers movie and I was looking forward to

227
00:21:07,954 --> 00:21:12,615
Thor the Dark World, especially when they announced
that Alan Taylor would be directing it, a guy

228
00:21:12,635 --> 00:21:16,996
who had helmed some of the better Game of Thrones
episodes. But originally he wasn't going to

229
00:21:17,036 --> 00:21:21,506
direct it, right? It was going to be Patty Jenkins,
the same director who did Wonder Woman. Right,

230
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:26,550
yeah, but she had a falling out due to creative
differences. Although it was a cordial split

231
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:31,874
for Marvel, as I understand it. I'll be honest,
when Thor the Dark World came out, I hadn't

232
00:21:31,894 --> 00:21:36,678
seen any of Game of Thrones yet, but I did know
of the show's reputation, and I knew that the

233
00:21:36,719 --> 00:21:42,664
realm of mythological high fantasy was exactly
where I wanted the Thor franchise to go. And

234
00:21:42,704 --> 00:21:46,567
during the marketing of the movie, you know,
we saw that he was going to visit other realms,

235
00:21:46,907 --> 00:21:53,500
and that we'd see the Dark Elves, and needless
to say, I was excited for this movie, but when

236
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:59,465
I left the theater, you know what? I was still
excited, you know? The film was almost exactly

237
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:05,230
what I expected and the ending was spectacular
because we saw Loki secretly on Asgard's throne

238
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:10,395
and we got the very first mention of the Infinity
Gems or stones as they came to be known in

239
00:22:10,415 --> 00:22:15,371
the movies. Like I was pumped leaving the theater.
I even went and saw it in theaters again, and

240
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:20,295
I guess I never really understood the general
disdain for this movie. Yeah, me neither. Like

241
00:22:20,435 --> 00:22:25,219
I heard this movie was bad, so I never went
to go see it in theaters. I actually did not

242
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:30,763
see this movie until I think a few days before
seeing Thor Ragnarok, because you essentially

243
00:22:30,843 --> 00:22:37,449
forced me to watch it. And I was glad I did.
I totally do not understand the hate that this

244
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:42,293
film gets. Yeah, I mean, I'll admit it's been
a good five or so years since I've rewatched

245
00:22:42,333 --> 00:22:47,029
this movie. I don't know if it's because of
how the Thor franchise has devolved with Thor

246
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:51,633
11th Under, and maybe my mind is just comparing
Thor the Dark World to the current state of

247
00:22:51,653 --> 00:22:56,778
the franchise. But yeah, I really enjoyed watching
this movie again. I feel like Thor the Dark

248
00:22:56,818 --> 00:23:02,103
World is so much more like what an ideal Thor
film should be. Oh yeah, yeah I liked this

249
00:23:02,143 --> 00:23:06,747
so much more than the first movie. I actually
liked this more than Thor Ragnarok even, I

250
00:23:06,767 --> 00:23:11,743
know that's like a lot of people's favorite
Thor movie. But for me, I want to see Thor

251
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:17,848
in his like Norse mythical element. Taika Waititi
ruined Thor in some ways because they took

252
00:23:17,888 --> 00:23:22,032
the character in such a comedic route that I
don't know if we could ever get back to this

253
00:23:22,172 --> 00:23:27,056
version of Thor that's much more Shakespearean,
much more dramatic. I hope they do, though.

254
00:23:27,517 --> 00:23:31,420
Yeah, I think if they tried to revert back to
this more serious tone, people would be like,

255
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:35,503
when did Thor become so boring or something
like that? But that's not the case. It's more

256
00:23:35,523 --> 00:23:40,375
like when did Thor become so goofy? Right. So
yeah, I really like Thor the Dark World. Don't

257
00:23:40,395 --> 00:23:44,537
get me wrong, the movie's not perfect. It does
suffer from an underwhelming villain and a

258
00:23:44,717 --> 00:23:49,560
mumbo jumbo-y plot device in the Convergence,
but Thor the Dark World is where I'd really

259
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:53,562
like to see the franchise return. My favorite
Thor stories from the comics are the ones that

260
00:23:53,602 --> 00:23:58,545
take place entirely or largely away from Earth
within the other eight realms, where we get

261
00:23:58,565 --> 00:24:03,668
to explore Marvel's unique approach to Norse
mythology, which I find fascinating. Stories

262
00:24:03,688 --> 00:24:08,587
like Disassembled, where Ragnarok finally takes
hold. Mjolnir's Song where Thor battles the

263
00:24:08,627 --> 00:24:14,552
Midgard Serpent, Tales of Asgard, and the Surtr
Saga. All awesome. I love when Thor's stories

264
00:24:14,713 --> 00:24:19,777
feel like Lord of the Rings because the realm
of fantasy is kind of unique in Marvel. Like

265
00:24:19,817 --> 00:24:23,881
the mythic fantasy genre isn't exclusive to
Thor because you still have characters like

266
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:28,865
Hercules and the Black Knight. But Thor is a
great character and his popularity gives Marvel

267
00:24:28,905 --> 00:24:33,729
probably their best opportunity for that kind
of mythical fantasy exploration and world building.

268
00:24:34,226 --> 00:24:39,889
Yeah, especially considering that, like, high
fantasy really came out of Norse mythology,

269
00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:46,012
I would say. Like, the world of Lord of the
Rings owes so much to it that Marvel could

270
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:50,574
totally play up on that fact. Yeah, high fantasy
as we know it is a mix of, like, Celtic and

271
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:55,497
Norse mythology. And I'm a huge fan of the Lord
of the Rings. And I feel like this Thor the

272
00:24:55,537 --> 00:25:00,240
Dark World is the closest that Marvel has ever
gotten to that. Yeah, I would say that it's

273
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:05,467
the closest that anything from Marvel or DC
has ever gotten to that sort of high fantasy

274
00:25:05,507 --> 00:25:11,632
kind of approach. But the cool thing about the
world of Thor too is that it feels so believable

275
00:25:11,692 --> 00:25:17,017
in a way too, which I love. Yeah, I mean, the
world building in Thor the Dark World is a

276
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:24,063
lot of fun. From Asgard's flying aircraft to
Svartalheim's never-ending eclipse, from Odin's

277
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:29,488
library room to, you know, the village camps
of Vanaheim. I just had a blast on every one

278
00:25:29,508 --> 00:25:34,300
of those worlds and I wish we got more of that.
You know, none of this new Asgard on Earth

279
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:40,805
crap where they serve Infinity Cone's ice cream.
Bullshit. Ugh. Asgard has gotten so dumb lately

280
00:25:40,985 --> 00:25:45,129
and it's so lame that they blew it up in the
MCU so they can't like ever go back there.

281
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:49,372
They gotta find a way to rebuild Asgard so that
the Asgardians can find their former glory

282
00:25:49,692 --> 00:25:53,356
because right now they're just a shell of what
they used to be. The overarching story here

283
00:25:53,376 --> 00:25:58,180
is kind of interesting too where you have this
ancient race of dark beings trying to restore

284
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:03,436
the reality from before the dawn of light. using
an all-powerful magic artifact during a time

285
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:08,199
when all the realms align. You know, the setup
is really good for a high fantasy adventure.

286
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:12,983
Where it all goes wrong is in the climax, and
I think that's what mostly disappointed viewers,

287
00:26:13,023 --> 00:26:18,287
because what was supposed to be the strongest
point of the movie kind of fell flat. In the

288
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:22,710
final battle between Malekith and Thor, you
know, you have, you know, a bland, underwhelming

289
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:28,198
villain using this powerful artifact in one
of the most unimaginative ways possible. You

290
00:26:28,238 --> 00:26:32,882
have a bunch of less interesting human side
characters running around adding needless comedic

291
00:26:32,922 --> 00:26:37,326
relief. And while the portals between the realms
added an interesting dynamic to the battle

292
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:41,969
and gave it some nice momentum, it was kind
of hard to understand where and why and when

293
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:46,313
the portals were going to take the fight to
another world. And so it felt kind of disorienting

294
00:26:46,353 --> 00:26:52,739
from a narrative and visual standpoint. Absolutely.
I honestly feel like the human characters in

295
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:56,978
this movie kind of ruined the film. I don't
think you even really needed them. Yeah, but

296
00:26:57,018 --> 00:27:02,079
like I feel like the criticisms of the film's
comedy that I heard when the film came out,

297
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:06,481
like the jokey scene of Selvick running around
naked at Stonehenge, those nitpicks I feel

298
00:27:06,501 --> 00:27:12,463
like don't hold as much weight now as they used
to considering that scene seems rather minor

299
00:27:12,563 --> 00:27:18,165
compared to the stupidity of where the franchise
is now. Very true. If anything, Thor the Dark

300
00:27:18,185 --> 00:27:23,295
World has just gotten better with age as a film.
I definitely agree and I hope that eventually

301
00:27:23,375 --> 00:27:28,059
over time people online and the social media
community will see how good this movie was

302
00:27:28,099 --> 00:27:33,263
compared to the Takeaway TD films that we got.
Yeah, go back and sample it guys. If it's been

303
00:27:33,283 --> 00:27:36,805
a while since you've seen the movie or if you
didn't like the movie to begin with, you might

304
00:27:36,846 --> 00:27:42,450
find that your opinion has changed on it. I
think for the angle between Thor and his brother

305
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:48,474
Loki alone, that makes this entire movie. Oh
for sure, yeah. I mean, the brothers had a

306
00:27:48,494 --> 00:27:53,436
good dynamic going in Thor Ragnarok, but I think
in Thor the Dark World they had their best

307
00:27:53,476 --> 00:27:57,898
moment. Let's go ahead and talk about the characters
more in our character breakdown. Starting with

308
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:02,640
Thor Odinson, played by Chris Hemsworth. Now
I think Hemsworth's performance in this movie

309
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:07,302
is the most he's ever felt like Thor to me.
You know, I know he prefers his goofy jokes

310
00:28:07,482 --> 00:28:11,263
and ultimately took the character in a much
more comedic route because he found this more

311
00:28:11,343 --> 00:28:16,305
serious Thor to be bland. But as a fan of the
comics, I've never found Thor to be goofy.

312
00:28:16,834 --> 00:28:22,196
To me, he's always been noble, serious, and
yet also zealous in battle. I thought his role

313
00:28:22,236 --> 00:28:27,318
here built off of the first Thor movie pretty
well, where we saw him mature a little bit.

314
00:28:27,558 --> 00:28:31,439
And also he had some good vulnerable moments
in the film, such as when his mother, Frigga,

315
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:37,882
died or when he was arguing with Loki on Spratlheim.
There's a reason why Verisimilitude was the

316
00:28:37,982 --> 00:28:42,424
theme behind the scenes of Richard Donner's
first Superman movie. It was because you could

317
00:28:42,464 --> 00:28:47,198
totally go the Adam West Batman route with this,
but that's not what he wanted. because he wanted

318
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:51,139
to treat the character with more respect. And
you know, Patty Jenkins took the same approach

319
00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:56,002
with the first Wonder Woman movie. The word
cheesy was banned on set because they wanted

320
00:28:56,142 --> 00:29:00,263
to treat the characters with seriousness. And
I feel like Alan Taylor took the same approach

321
00:29:00,283 --> 00:29:04,785
with a lot of scenes, probably a majority of
the scenes in this movie. Yeah, and he kind

322
00:29:04,805 --> 00:29:08,347
of grounded things too. I mean, if you look
at Thor's arc, it's really centered around

323
00:29:08,387 --> 00:29:13,749
his love for Jane. From beginning to end, you
know, he dismisses Sif. He watches Jane with

324
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:18,319
Heimdall. When he sees she's in trouble, he
brings her to Asgard. When she's dying, he

325
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:22,921
risks it all to have Malekith remove the Aether
from her. And when the realms are saved, he

326
00:29:22,981 --> 00:29:27,263
renounces his throne to be with her. There's
an interesting moment midway through the film

327
00:29:27,283 --> 00:29:31,945
when Loki tells Thor that Jane is going to die
regardless if the Aether takes her or not.

328
00:29:32,385 --> 00:29:37,647
That even if she lives decades longer, the time
would be fleeting to them as gods. And Thor

329
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:42,049
simply states that he won't be saying goodbye
to her today. You know, it was almost a nice

330
00:29:42,069 --> 00:29:47,053
foreshadowing. to the events of Thor, Love and
Thunder. I will never forgive that fourth film

331
00:29:47,193 --> 00:29:51,396
for butchering Jane's cancer arc the way that
it did because it really had the perfect setup

332
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:56,220
from this movie. Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah, that
was definitely top of mind as I was rewatching

333
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:01,004
this because I'd forgotten that the ether made
her sick. Yeah. Speaking of Jane Foster, let's

334
00:30:01,024 --> 00:30:05,568
go ahead and move on to her played by Natalie
Portman. Now Natalie Portman, I thought was

335
00:30:05,608 --> 00:30:10,011
fine here in this movie. Sometimes she could
be a little bit iffy in her acting, especially

336
00:30:10,532 --> 00:30:13,666
with scenes that you could tell she's not quite
comfortable in. but I thought she did pretty

337
00:30:13,706 --> 00:30:18,410
well in this film particularly. Yeah, I thought
she did better here than she did in Love and

338
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:24,035
Thunder. I believed the romance between her
and Thor. Yeah, where Thor was a fish out of

339
00:30:24,075 --> 00:30:28,699
water in the first movie on Earth, it was interesting
to see that flipped where she was the fish

340
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:33,624
out of water traveling among Asgard and the
other realms. One of the things that I appreciate

341
00:30:33,644 --> 00:30:38,108
the most about Jane, and I don't know if everyone
appreciates this, but it's one of the things

342
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:43,243
that I find endearing about her character. is
how she uses science to explain her understanding

343
00:30:43,303 --> 00:30:49,047
of the magic of the nine realms. Like what Thor
calls the Bifrost, she calls an Einstein-Rosen

344
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:54,350
Bridge. What Odin calls the Convergence, she
calls spatial extrusions and gravitational

345
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:59,693
anomalies. What they call the Soul Forge, she
calls a... Quantum field generator. Yeah, I

346
00:30:59,713 --> 00:31:03,936
always liked that about her character. Just
the way these like mortal minds could possibly

347
00:31:03,976 --> 00:31:10,455
conceive of this mythological magic, you know?
And I thought it was a particularly nice, subtle

348
00:31:10,475 --> 00:31:15,397
moment when she finally got to travel through
the Bifrost. You got this flash of the scientist

349
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:19,959
in her just giddy with happiness finally getting
to be inside the thing that she had spent her

350
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:24,481
whole life studying. And also, I really liked
her wardrobe here. I think Natalie Portman

351
00:31:24,501 --> 00:31:28,523
looked really great in the S. Guardian garb.
And actually, I think everyone looked great

352
00:31:28,763 --> 00:31:32,705
in Thor the Dark World. This movie had the best
costumes out of all the films. It just all

353
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:38,656
felt very classic. Oh, yeah. Yeah, everything
from the Dark Elves to the different realms

354
00:31:38,777 --> 00:31:44,141
I thought were amazing. Loki has never looked
better. Yeah, and Thor too. He didn't have

355
00:31:44,161 --> 00:31:48,724
like the goofy bleached eyebrows and he had
like longer hair here and just his costume

356
00:31:48,764 --> 00:31:53,147
looked a little bit more grand to me. Yeah,
even when he was walking around in Asgard without

357
00:31:53,207 --> 00:31:59,892
it. Yeah. Let's go to move on to Loki Loffi-san,
played by Tom Hiddleston. Man, Loki was so

358
00:32:00,113 --> 00:32:04,465
good in this movie. Of course, Tom Hiddleston
nailed the performance and as far as I'm concerned,

359
00:32:04,525 --> 00:32:09,791
it was the perfect arc for Loki following his
previous two film appearances. He gets imprisoned,

360
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:15,117
during which time the only person he ever cared
for, his adoptive mother Frigga, gets killed.

361
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:20,364
So we see him at his absolute lowest point,
then he teams up with his brother and mortal

362
00:32:20,444 --> 00:32:25,672
enemy for a chance at revenge. and he ends up
still scheming to take the throne at the finale,

363
00:32:25,792 --> 00:32:30,134
which he gets and seems like his highest point.
So there's a real rollercoaster here with Loki.

364
00:32:30,154 --> 00:32:34,537
It was so much fun to watch the story unfold
here. And he's just far and away the MCU's

365
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:38,139
most interesting character when you think about
how far he's come, you know, through these

366
00:32:38,179 --> 00:32:42,882
Thor films and even through his own television
series. I also love the fact that he sacrificed

367
00:32:42,922 --> 00:32:47,045
himself in the middle of that. Like he had this
like bit of redemption. And I remember the

368
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:53,087
first time I watched this. I totally did not
see that Loki took the throne from Odin initially.

369
00:32:53,607 --> 00:32:58,288
Yeah, my jaw dropped because I had no idea what
was going on. Svartelheim, when you see him

370
00:32:58,328 --> 00:33:03,530
like take on the role of the Einherjar. I think
I'm pronouncing that right. The soldier guy.

371
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:07,751
Yeah. And then he goes and reports back to Odin
and he was like, there was a body. And then

372
00:33:07,931 --> 00:33:13,213
there was an interesting moment there where
Odin says Loki. And then the soldier guy smiles.

373
00:33:13,413 --> 00:33:18,146
And I think it's up for interpretation. What
happens there? Either Odin recognizes that

374
00:33:18,206 --> 00:33:24,069
soldier as Loki and is addressing him as such,
or he's saying that the body they found was

375
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:29,791
Loki. And then the guy smiles because he's about
to enact his spell that casts Odin down to

376
00:33:29,831 --> 00:33:36,954
Midgard, you know. It's a wonderfully ambiguous
moment. That's just peak Loki. Anthony Hopkins

377
00:33:37,054 --> 00:33:41,356
is such a phenomenal actor in this. I still
can't believe he's in the Marvel Universe.

378
00:33:41,816 --> 00:33:46,494
He's too damn good for it. More like too good
for the DC Universe, you mean? Which is why

379
00:33:46,534 --> 00:33:51,277
he's never been in it. But speaking of classic
British actors, let's go ahead and move on

380
00:33:51,317 --> 00:33:57,921
to Malekith, played by Christopher Eccleston.
Christopher Eccleston is a solid actor. When

381
00:33:57,941 --> 00:34:02,563
he was cast as Malekith, I was ecstatic because
even though I've never seen Doctor Who, I knew

382
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:08,167
of his reputation, and I had seen Eccleston
in some other things. When I saw his performance

383
00:34:08,207 --> 00:34:13,506
though, I was really disappointed at how generic
and bland he approached the role. I don't know

384
00:34:13,526 --> 00:34:17,228
if that was a direction thing or if he thought
that the makeup would do most of the acting

385
00:34:17,288 --> 00:34:22,012
for him, but it wasn't interesting. And that's
a shame because as you learned in our last

386
00:34:22,052 --> 00:34:27,775
episode, the character of Malekith is so interesting
from the comics. Yeah, I mean, I remember thinking

387
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:33,759
as you were reading his bio, like, is this going
to ruin Thor the Dark World for me? Luckily

388
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:40,044
it didn't. And I agree with you that he probably
put on the costume and just felt like he was

389
00:34:40,124 --> 00:34:44,386
embodying the character. Although, you know,
British actors tend to be more technical than

390
00:34:44,686 --> 00:34:49,867
method when it comes to their acting approach.
But I don't think it's that bad. Yes, it is

391
00:34:49,927 --> 00:34:55,409
bland, but I think it wouldn't have come across
as so bland if he wasn't around such a colorful

392
00:34:55,469 --> 00:35:02,711
cast of characters, specifically the goofy human
ones. Like Sauron is, you know, pretty bland,

393
00:35:02,791 --> 00:35:07,812
you could argue. But no one complains about
that. Sauron is more of an entity, you know,

394
00:35:07,992 --> 00:35:14,355
than an actual character. Well, a ringwraith
then. I guess also entities. Yeah. Now this

395
00:35:14,395 --> 00:35:19,558
film Malekith's motivation is his fixation on
returning the universe to one of darkness when

396
00:35:19,578 --> 00:35:24,501
the dark elves thrived before the dawn of light.
He tries to use the reality stone to achieve

397
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:28,983
his goal, but the problem is that even when
he gets the ether, he doesn't particularly

398
00:35:29,063 --> 00:35:34,447
seem as threatening as he should be. No. You
know, for a guy who can warp all reality, he

399
00:35:34,487 --> 00:35:39,089
seems unimaginative and underpowered. Well,
I mean, it was never really clearly established

400
00:35:39,109 --> 00:35:46,148
that he had the reality infinity stone until
the very end of the movie. So, I mean, if you're

401
00:35:46,168 --> 00:35:49,950
just watching this for the first time, you're
not going to assume that he just all of a sudden

402
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:55,333
has infinite power almost. But yeah, in hindsight,
watching this, oh, you're going to shoot some

403
00:35:55,433 --> 00:36:02,456
crystal shards. OK, they seem to be doing nothing.
I mean, we spent the whole movie as the audience

404
00:36:02,576 --> 00:36:08,459
just dreading what would happen if the villain
got his red juice. And you know, it was underwhelming,

405
00:36:08,679 --> 00:36:13,743
especially the line from Thor during the climactic
battle when he says, You know, with all that

406
00:36:13,783 --> 00:36:19,428
power, I thought you'd hit harder. That horribly
undersold Malekith and his might. You know,

407
00:36:19,528 --> 00:36:24,692
he seemed so much weaker than his henchman,
Kurs, who was beating the shit out of Thor

408
00:36:24,812 --> 00:36:29,857
over on Svartalheim. Right? So it just made
Malekith all the less impressive, which is

409
00:36:29,917 --> 00:36:33,640
something that you don't want for a guy who
already started out pretty bland. Well, how

410
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,771
would you have changed it? Like, what would
you have done? I would have changed the characterization

411
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:43,175
of Malekith and I also would have rewritten
the climactic battle so that it was more of

412
00:36:43,215 --> 00:36:47,878
a struggle for Thor. He can't be going around
saying lines like, you call that a punch or

413
00:36:47,898 --> 00:36:53,042
something like that, you know, it just doesn't
work. The villain needs to be seen as a legitimate

414
00:36:53,062 --> 00:36:57,205
threat. Now, there are a few other characters
within the movie. You know, you have the human

415
00:36:57,245 --> 00:37:02,649
scientists and you also have the Warriors Three
and the other Asgardians and you have Curse

416
00:37:02,689 --> 00:37:06,761
as well. but none of them had substantial enough
roles within the plot, I think, to warrant

417
00:37:06,781 --> 00:37:10,213
a character breakdown. So let's go ahead and
move into our story highlights.

425
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:10,054
Millennia ago, the leader of the Dark Elves,
Malekith the Accursed, tried to use the power

426
00:38:10,094 --> 00:38:15,018
of the Reality Warping Aether to cast the universe
into darkness during a time when the Nine Realms

427
00:38:15,138 --> 00:38:20,462
were in celestial alignment. He was stopped
by Bor, leader of the Asgardians who caused

428
00:38:20,522 --> 00:38:25,646
Malekith to flee, and the Asgardians hid the
Aether deep underground. This opening scene

429
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:31,351
was awesome. Dude, it reminded me of the opening
scene to the Fellowship of the Ring. Yeah.

430
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:36,916
It was so cool to see Odin's father, Bor. and
to see him lead the Asgardians against the

431
00:38:36,956 --> 00:38:42,261
Dark Elves. Just all the world building that
took place in the scene alone had me pumped

432
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:47,085
for the rest of the movie. I just love the approach
they took with the Dark Elves and the Asgardians,

433
00:38:47,345 --> 00:38:51,329
and like the different weaponry they had and
stuff like that. Like the Dark Elves had their

434
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:55,913
black hole bombs and red crystals that they
could crush and would turn them into like these

435
00:38:55,953 --> 00:39:01,662
powerhouses. It was almost like, I don't know
why, StarCraft for some reason to me. Yeah,

436
00:39:01,682 --> 00:39:05,283
like it was like the Zerg versus the Protoss
or something like that. It was just really

437
00:39:05,323 --> 00:39:10,944
cool. That's a great analogy. That's really
what it felt like. I don't necessarily love

438
00:39:10,984 --> 00:39:15,786
the more sci-fi angle of the Dark Elves, but
somehow we still managed to work within the

439
00:39:15,806 --> 00:39:20,627
parameters of this mythological fantasy world
building. Yeah, I think Alan Taylor has done

440
00:39:20,647 --> 00:39:25,849
that better than any other director to handle
Thor. Yeah, the look of the Dark Elves to their

441
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:31,755
masks. That's cool. That's really cool. I guess
I just wish they weren't firing guns. I wish

442
00:39:31,775 --> 00:39:36,457
they were firing bow and arrow type weapons.
Or at least like a, like do a crossbow. Like

443
00:39:36,537 --> 00:39:41,559
meet me in the middle. Right. In the present
day, after the battle of New York, Loki is

444
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:46,842
imprisoned for attempting to enslave humanity.
With the Bifrost now restored after the events

445
00:39:46,862 --> 00:39:52,164
of the first Thor film, Thor and his friends
travel the realms, restoring peace before returning

446
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:59,668
home to Asgard. The scene on Vanaheim. was interesting
because you have Thor going up against a cronin,

447
00:39:59,748 --> 00:40:04,651
which is a race of beings that Korg is a member
of. So it's funny seeing this like serious

448
00:40:04,691 --> 00:40:09,774
version of Korg just get his ass kicked by Thor
when he essentially reduces him to rubble.

449
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:16,938
I wish Thor would do that to Korg. Yeah, I agree.
That's what I felt when I saw that. It's interesting

450
00:40:16,978 --> 00:40:21,500
how each of the realms have their own kind of
geography to them. Like Vanaheim is very much

451
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:27,805
like the foresty type realm. You know, Jotunheim
is the icy realm, Muspelheim is the fiery realm.

452
00:40:28,285 --> 00:40:33,490
You have Svartelheim, which is like the dark
desert. Midgard, of course, is the planet Earth.

453
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:39,356
Asgard is the golden city, the golden realm,
you know. Oh, man. Niflheim, which was portrayed

454
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:44,821
in Thor Ragnarok when Valkyrie fought Hela,
and that was like a land of smoke and mist

455
00:40:44,841 --> 00:40:50,282
and stuff. So many different worlds. Such cool
settings. Yeah, they're really cool. Meanwhile,

456
00:40:50,382 --> 00:40:55,386
on Earth, astrophysicist Jane Foster and her
assistant Darcy stumble upon a gravitational

457
00:40:55,466 --> 00:41:00,911
anomaly in London caused by the Convergence,
which is an alignment of the realms. A hidden

458
00:41:00,971 --> 00:41:06,015
portal takes Jane to the secret location of
the Aether, where it invades her body. Thor

459
00:41:06,075 --> 00:41:11,140
notices her disappearance and travels to Earth
to bring her to Asgard for help. There, Thor

460
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,964
and Jane learn that the Aether will kill Jane
if it's not removed from her body. Now, as

461
00:41:16,004 --> 00:41:23,496
far as plot devices go, The convergence is not
the cleanest. It's a little bit muddy. There

462
00:41:23,516 --> 00:41:28,178
aren't any clear rules to it other than just
sometimes there are these places where you

463
00:41:28,218 --> 00:41:33,920
can slip between the worlds. And that's basically
it. How that corresponds to the floating disks

464
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:38,722
that appear hovering over a Greenwich during
the precise moment of the convergence and stuff

465
00:41:38,742 --> 00:41:43,364
like that. It's, it's a little bit weird. I
don't know if they quite knew how to depict

466
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:48,527
it in this abstract way. I just don't think
it was very successful. I saw those as sort

467
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:54,531
of like tears in reality and like openings to
these other worlds essentially. I didn't think

468
00:41:54,551 --> 00:41:58,234
it was terrible. I think that's what a lot of
people have issue with this film though. It's

469
00:41:58,274 --> 00:42:03,698
simple in concept, but the more you think about
it, I feel like the less it holds up and it's

470
00:42:03,838 --> 00:42:09,262
largely a matter of convenience in terms of
how the plot progresses. Like, of course Jane

471
00:42:09,282 --> 00:42:13,765
just happened to find the portal that leads
to the secret location of the ether. Of course.

472
00:42:14,146 --> 00:42:18,650
Thor and Jane just happen to find the portal
that leads back to Jane's car back on Earth

473
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:23,796
at the end, you know? Well, I mean, sort of.
The first one I would say, you know, she is

474
00:42:24,036 --> 00:42:29,282
a leading scientist in the world regarding this
kind of stuff. So it makes sense that she would

475
00:42:29,522 --> 00:42:35,608
stumble upon it before pretty much anyone else
except for those kids. You could definitely

476
00:42:35,628 --> 00:42:39,547
say it's convenient. That they found their way
back to their car But they also kind of set

477
00:42:39,567 --> 00:42:43,970
that up earlier in the film in the scene that
we're talking about Where things would go through

478
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:48,693
the portals and come back to the same location?
So not too convenient. You don't have to spend

479
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:54,217
so much time defending it man. It's okay It
is a bunch of mumbo jumbo. I'm saying it makes

480
00:42:54,257 --> 00:42:59,301
sense in the story that they set up right in
concept Yes, but I also think that maybe you're

481
00:42:59,321 --> 00:43:04,304
not thinking about as hard as you could be and
for that. I'm grateful I'm thinking about it

482
00:43:04,384 --> 00:43:11,660
so hard. You have no idea My favorite joke in
this whole movie is when the intern to Darcy

483
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:16,502
throws the keys into the portal and then they
just like don't reappear and she's like, were

484
00:43:16,522 --> 00:43:23,625
those the car keys? That was a solid joke. Yeah,
that was great. Back to the story, the discovery

485
00:43:23,665 --> 00:43:29,167
of the Aether awakens the Dark Elves from suspended
animation. Malekith's lieutenant, Algrim the

486
00:43:29,207 --> 00:43:35,491
Strong, goes undercover as a marauder and infiltrates
Asgard's prison. where he dons the curse armor

487
00:43:35,611 --> 00:43:40,995
and causes a mass breakout. The Dark Elves invade
Asgard looking for Jane to extract the Aether

488
00:43:41,015 --> 00:43:46,800
from her, though Thor's mother Frigga successfully
hides her and is killed in the process. Thor

489
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:51,824
burns half of Malekith's face with his lightning,
but he is unable to keep the Dark Elves from

490
00:43:51,884 --> 00:43:57,549
fleeing. Asgard mourns Frigga, including Loki,
from his cell. So much to talk about here.

491
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:03,653
The way they portrayed the curse armor in this
movie I thought was really cool. And he was

492
00:44:03,753 --> 00:44:08,035
definitely as strong as he's supposed to be.
Because curse in the comics is about twice

493
00:44:08,075 --> 00:44:13,779
as strong as Thor. And Thor is stronger than
a motherfucker. So this guy is incredibly strong.

494
00:44:13,919 --> 00:44:18,622
And I think they did a good job of showcasing
that power and just, you know, his ability

495
00:44:18,642 --> 00:44:22,625
to punch his way out of prison, essentially.
Yeah, he literally punched through a force

496
00:44:22,645 --> 00:44:27,735
field. That was wild. Frigga's final fight against
Malekith I thought was badass. She turned into

497
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:32,636
a total freaking warrior chick just slashing
him across the face and stuff. Rene Russo was

498
00:44:32,656 --> 00:44:36,857
badass with that sword. I don't know if that
was entirely her in all those shots, but I

499
00:44:36,877 --> 00:44:42,659
was impressed. So it was incredibly tragic when
Malekith had cursed Stapper. Yeah, that was

500
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:47,540
a great scene. I love the fact that they depicted
her as this trickster. It really led credence

501
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,361
to the idea that she had a close relationship
with Loki and maybe like taught him everything

502
00:44:51,401 --> 00:44:57,931
he knows. and gave him reason and justification
for why he would be upset by her death enough

503
00:44:57,951 --> 00:45:04,333
to team up with his rival. The scene when Loki
learns that Frigid died, he kind of takes it

504
00:45:04,393 --> 00:45:10,755
in stride with a stone face and then unleashes
his might subtly just by clenching his fist

505
00:45:10,795 --> 00:45:16,177
and all the furniture around his room goes flying.
You see the storm of emotion that's welling

506
00:45:16,217 --> 00:45:21,879
inside of him. Yeah, totally. Regarding the
fight... of the Dark Elves versus the Asgardian

507
00:45:21,899 --> 00:45:27,183
forces. The Dark Elves are cloaked from Asgard
and from Heimdall in particular. He was not

508
00:45:27,223 --> 00:45:32,647
able to detect their invasion. And when they
fly past his sentry post, I thought the movie

509
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:39,452
got very Star Wars-esque because you have these
like Viking ship-inspired crafts shooting like

510
00:45:39,552 --> 00:45:44,315
light lasers at these Dark Elf ships that are
almost like flying swords the way they like

511
00:45:44,335 --> 00:45:50,247
crash into stuff. It was incredibly imaginative.
Dude. Those ships are way cooler than TIE fighters.

512
00:45:50,487 --> 00:45:54,750
The Elves ships, they were really cool. I've
never seen anything like that in any sort of

513
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:59,432
sci-fi spacefaring action scene. You know, it
was really cool. Dude, they did here. Why do

514
00:45:59,472 --> 00:46:04,876
people hate this movie? It makes no sense. They
just need to watch that scene again. Hell,

515
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:10,099
yeah. What did you think of the funeral scene
when they shot the flaming arrow onto Frigga's

516
00:46:10,179 --> 00:46:15,682
boat and then it turned into stars that floated
up into the cosmos? I thought that was really

517
00:46:15,702 --> 00:46:23,345
heartfelt and a really good way of like reimagining
a god version of a Viking funeral. Yeah, it

518
00:46:23,365 --> 00:46:27,807
was more emotional than I even remembered. I
think it was the music. The movie has a beautiful

519
00:46:27,847 --> 00:46:33,349
score and the theme that's playing as they send
up these like magic light ball, like paper

520
00:46:33,409 --> 00:46:39,232
lantern-esque lights into the sky was just breathtaking.
Back to the story. To prevent another invasion

521
00:46:39,272 --> 00:46:44,646
into Asgard, Thor develops a plan to take Jane
to the Dark World, Svartalheim. to draw Malekith

522
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:49,829
there where he can extract the Aether and then
Thor can destroy it. Odin denies his request,

523
00:46:50,169 --> 00:46:54,672
believing Malekith obtaining the Aether is too
great a risk. Thor then conspires with his

524
00:46:54,712 --> 00:46:59,455
friends to steal Jaina away in secret, and he
breaks Loki out of prison for his help since

525
00:46:59,475 --> 00:47:04,077
the God of Mischief knows the secret way out
of Asgard. The whole heist scene that happens

526
00:47:04,117 --> 00:47:08,760
in the second act of this movie was incredible.
It's so much fun. Especially because that's

527
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:13,515
when Loki really comes into play. You know,
and that scene where Thor approaches his brother

528
00:47:13,535 --> 00:47:17,978
and we see him lying on the floor just in agony.
That was a great brotherly moment. And, you

529
00:47:17,998 --> 00:47:21,841
know, when Loki's giving Thor shit and transforms
into Captain America and everything like that,

530
00:47:22,181 --> 00:47:26,525
it's just a series of great moments one right
after the other during this whole heist portion.

531
00:47:26,965 --> 00:47:32,149
Yeah, I agree. My favorite part was where Loki
was like, this is the dumbest idea. You're

532
00:47:32,189 --> 00:47:36,131
taking the biggest ship and you're trying to
escape with it. And then Thor just like pushes

533
00:47:36,151 --> 00:47:41,150
him out of the ship. That was hilarious. That
was great. I had forgotten that Zachary Levi

534
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:46,851
was in this film. Yeah, he plays Fandral, the
dashing. He was actually recast from the actor

535
00:47:46,891 --> 00:47:51,593
who played the character in the first film.
And he did a great job. He does a fantastic

536
00:47:51,613 --> 00:47:56,494
job. He has a very like Errol Flynn demeanor
about him that just suits the character so

537
00:47:56,534 --> 00:48:01,876
well. Yeah. There was another great scene that
happened around this point in the story where

538
00:48:02,076 --> 00:48:09,978
Thor and Loki are on Svartalheim traveling toward
Malekith and Thor tells his brother like, and

539
00:48:10,158 --> 00:48:14,582
Loki's like, you can trust my rage. I thought
that was fantastic character building and relationship

540
00:48:14,622 --> 00:48:19,527
building. Oh, that and the whole conversation
preceding it, that was fantastic stuff. Right.

541
00:48:19,607 --> 00:48:24,532
Loki blames Thor for him being imprisoned during
his mother's death, but Thor was like, actually

542
00:48:24,592 --> 00:48:29,356
you're to blame for that. And it's just like,
the conflict there is brilliant. Thor and Loki

543
00:48:29,416 --> 00:48:34,381
confront Melekith and the Dark Elves. When it
appears, Loki betrays Thor and cuts off his

544
00:48:34,421 --> 00:48:38,939
hand. However, the illusion is revealed when
Thor's hand reappears as he uses Mjolnir's

545
00:48:38,979 --> 00:48:44,161
lightning in an attempt to destroy the Aether
as it's extracted from Jain. The attempt proves

546
00:48:44,222 --> 00:48:48,784
fruitless however, and Malekith acquires his
prize before fleeing, leaving Kirst to battle

547
00:48:48,824 --> 00:48:53,746
Thor and Loki. Loki kills Kirst with one of
his own gravity grenades, but is stabbed in

548
00:48:53,786 --> 00:48:59,468
the process and seemingly dies in Thor's arms.
Man, okay, so what did you think the first

549
00:48:59,508 --> 00:49:05,911
time you saw Loki's apparent betrayal in this
movie? Dude, I was pissed and shocked. I was

550
00:49:06,091 --> 00:49:10,953
incredibly surprised. I did not see it coming.
But I also thought like classic Loki, you know,

551
00:49:10,973 --> 00:49:16,055
like he can't trust him. But it was surprising
to me just how harsh he seemingly went about

552
00:49:16,095 --> 00:49:20,537
it, where he was like, I'm Loki of Jotunheim.
I asked for one thing, a good place to watch

553
00:49:20,617 --> 00:49:25,980
Asgard burn. I'm like, well, this guy holds
a grudge like none other. The emotions that

554
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:29,601
just like surged through the audience when watching
this movie the first time when it was revealed

555
00:49:29,621 --> 00:49:34,246
that it was all a trick. and that Loki and Thor
were actually working together. You know, first

556
00:49:34,286 --> 00:49:39,648
you have the relief that Loki's not that big
of a douchebag. Then you have the relief that

557
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:43,049
it looks like their plan is going to be carried
out and, you know, they're going to destroy

558
00:49:43,069 --> 00:49:47,370
the Aether and save the day and work together.
And it was all just fantastic. And then you

559
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:52,752
combine that with what happened shortly after
where Loki seemingly dies. And it's nothing

560
00:49:52,772 --> 00:49:57,633
short of a roller coaster. It was so thrilling
to watch. I just loved the drama of it. On

561
00:49:57,693 --> 00:50:02,967
top of that, you have... Loki's real betrayal
where he takes the throne of Asgard. And yeah,

562
00:50:03,007 --> 00:50:08,210
this is like peak Thor and Loki. Guys, like
who dislikes this movie? You're wrong, you're

563
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:13,232
wrong. I thought it was particularly badass
how Loki seemingly died and how Loki killed

564
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:18,634
Kurs. Like Kurs was just laying waste to Thor,
you know. He was even deflecting Mjolnir being

565
00:50:18,654 --> 00:50:23,176
thrown at him and stuff like that, because he's
just that strong. But then Loki runs a sword

566
00:50:23,196 --> 00:50:28,738
through Kurs, Kurs not even really being affected.
uses that same sword that's going through his

567
00:50:28,778 --> 00:50:34,920
body to impale Loki, but Loki basically sacrifices
himself to get in close and pull one of Curse's

568
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,962
gravity bombs. It was a fascinating sequence
of events right there. Yeah, honestly, my favorite

569
00:50:40,002 --> 00:50:45,144
part of the whole movie. This whole scene was
just great. Yeah. Back to the story, Thor and

570
00:50:45,164 --> 00:50:49,745
Jane retreat to a cave where Jane discovers
another portal between Svartalheim and Earth.

571
00:50:50,294 --> 00:50:54,956
Back in London, she and Thor regroup with Darcy
and Erik Selvig where they determine the center

572
00:50:54,976 --> 00:50:59,859
of the convergence will be in Greenwich, England.
When Malekith and the Dark Elves arrive, Thor

573
00:50:59,919 --> 00:51:05,882
battles them as Jane and Erik use gravitational
anomaly detectors to help him out. I still

574
00:51:05,902 --> 00:51:12,365
don't understand how the humans were able to
create like portals and stuff with these tool

575
00:51:12,405 --> 00:51:17,948
things. I don't know. It was just, it was too
much. They were MacGuffins for sure. They weren't

576
00:51:17,988 --> 00:51:23,647
created to generate portals. They just happened
to be able to tap into that kind of energy

577
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:27,809
because they were made to detect gravitational
anomalies. I don't know if the science quite

578
00:51:27,849 --> 00:51:31,470
checks out on that, but you know, that's one
of the issues with this climactic battle to

579
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:36,753
begin with. You're saying that, you know, there's
mumbo jumbo in this movie. This is really,

580
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:40,774
I feel like the only thing that's mumbo jumbo.
This is the only thing that doesn't make sense

581
00:51:40,794 --> 00:51:46,457
to me. Yeah. Well, largely also because Thor
was able to use them as such powerful tools

582
00:51:46,517 --> 00:51:51,632
against his enemy. when he was like throwing
him into his arms and then Jane was using her

583
00:51:51,852 --> 00:51:56,935
computer to transport Malekith's body parts
and stuff like that. They were kind of cheating,

584
00:51:57,155 --> 00:52:01,978
I think. Absolutely. I guess is a way to put
it. And I guess you're right that Malekith

585
00:52:01,998 --> 00:52:06,820
was too weak in the sense that Kurs was blocking
shots from Yolner, but it just took one shot

586
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:13,224
from Yolner to essentially destroy Malekith.
Well, the final shot from Thor didn't destroy

587
00:52:13,264 --> 00:52:19,108
Malekith. It transported him limbless. to Svartalheim
where eventually the ship crashed onto him

588
00:52:19,148 --> 00:52:23,491
and that's what destroyed Malekith. That's fair.
That's true. But we're not quite there yet.

589
00:52:23,931 --> 00:52:28,234
Thor's battle against Malekith goes between
the realms of Earth, Svartalheim, Vanaheim,

590
00:52:28,334 --> 00:52:34,359
and Jotunheim as the Convergence reaches precise
alignment. Thor loses Mjolnir in the fight

591
00:52:34,779 --> 00:52:39,723
and Malekith begins shrouding the universe in
darkness. Thor uses the gravitational anomaly

592
00:52:39,763 --> 00:52:44,154
detectors to teleport Malekith away from the
Convergence and back into the Dark World. The

593
00:52:44,214 --> 00:52:48,137
Elves ship also gets transported there where
it falls and crushes Malekith, destroying him.

594
00:52:48,297 --> 00:52:53,182
Like I just said. In addition to all the substandard
stuff going on during this climax, I didn't

595
00:52:53,242 --> 00:52:58,507
like how they disrupted the action by having
Thor take the underground train to get back

596
00:52:58,527 --> 00:53:02,751
to Greenwich. I thought it was a needless break
that really sapped the great momentum that

597
00:53:02,771 --> 00:53:06,374
they had built up during the battle as they
were just basically flying through all these

598
00:53:06,394 --> 00:53:12,855
different realms, battling each other. No, I
100% agree. It's just that stupid Marvel bathos

599
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:17,678
that they think is funny. But I'm like, come
on, stop. Yeah, I was like, get back to it,

600
00:53:17,698 --> 00:53:23,142
guys. Hurry up. Hurry up. It turns the climactic
anti-climactic really is what it did. Right.

601
00:53:23,482 --> 00:53:28,406
Exactly. Especially the stuff with Darcy and
her intern, too. Like what we no one cared

602
00:53:28,426 --> 00:53:33,209
about them. We did not need to see that stuff
during the main battle. You know, Darcy, Jane,

603
00:53:33,469 --> 00:53:42,310
Ian, Sylveig, Mew Mew. That was pretty funny,
but unnecessary. Thor returns the Aether to

604
00:53:42,410 --> 00:53:47,351
Asgard where he tells Odin that he denies the
throne and wishes to remain with Jain on Earth.

605
00:53:47,711 --> 00:53:53,973
Odin accepts Thor's request but as Thor leaves,
Odin is revealed to be Loki in disguise. Thor

606
00:53:54,013 --> 00:53:59,375
returns to Earth and reunites with Jain. Meanwhile,
Thor's friends Volstagg and Sif give the Aether

607
00:53:59,435 --> 00:54:04,776
to the Collector to keep it separate from Asgard's
other Infinity Stone, the Tesseract. What did

608
00:54:04,796 --> 00:54:09,297
you think of the reveal when you saw Loki sitting
on the throne in the final shot before the

609
00:54:09,317 --> 00:54:16,179
credits rolled? Dude, I loved that. That was
like jaw dropping, just like, holy shit. That

610
00:54:16,199 --> 00:54:20,700
was such a great villain moment. Like if you
and I ever did a top 10 bonus episodes of like

611
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:26,002
the best villain moments, that's gotta be up
there. Oh, for sure. Hands down. I remember

612
00:54:26,022 --> 00:54:30,223
during the mid credit scene where we're on nowhere
with the collector, I just thought everything

613
00:54:30,383 --> 00:54:34,604
felt so bizarre, but that's because we hadn't
been introduced to the world of Guardians of

614
00:54:34,624 --> 00:54:40,005
the Galaxy yet, which was totally unlike anything
else that we had seen this point in the MCU.

615
00:54:40,266 --> 00:54:45,449
and the scene still feels really strange to
me. It was directed by James Gunn. The cinematography

616
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:50,453
is different. Yeah, and that adds to the disjointed
feeling you get when watching it. It really

617
00:54:50,473 --> 00:54:55,217
should have been the post-credits scene. They
should have flipped the post and mid-credits

618
00:54:55,237 --> 00:55:00,040
scenes, I feel. Yeah, yeah. The final end-credits
scene was Thor returning back to Earth and

619
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:04,884
he and Jane embracing each other, but I think
audiences really needed that type of closure

620
00:55:05,024 --> 00:55:09,355
within the main story itself, not just tacked
on. for sure, especially considering how many

621
00:55:09,395 --> 00:55:15,399
people I still, to this day, see leave during
the credits at a Marvel movie. I'm like, what

622
00:55:15,439 --> 00:55:20,743
are you doing? It's a Marvel movie. But that
brings us to the end of the film. I have very

623
00:55:20,803 --> 00:55:26,927
few bad things to say about it, honestly. I
appreciate this movie more now than I did back

624
00:55:26,947 --> 00:55:31,910
when I first watched it, and I really liked
it when I first watched it. I never quite understood

625
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:37,382
the flack that it got from fans. This is what
I want my Thor movie to be, essentially. Overall,

626
00:55:37,422 --> 00:55:41,425
the high fantasy worldbuilding and story align
with what the Norse mythological superheroes

627
00:55:41,545 --> 00:55:47,610
adventures should be. Generic villain notwithstanding,
I give this film 4 stars and a fresh rating

628
00:55:47,731 --> 00:55:53,315
on Rotten Tomatoes. Yeah, I definitely think
it's worthy of a 4 star rating. This is the

629
00:55:53,355 --> 00:55:58,039
same rating we gave Man of Steel in the first
Wonder Woman movie. I think it's up there.

630
00:55:58,500 --> 00:56:03,624
I mean, even though the villain is pretty bad
and the humans are kind of annoying, they're

631
00:56:03,644 --> 00:56:08,523
not so annoying to ruin the film. And there
are so many other things that just make up

632
00:56:08,563 --> 00:56:14,605
for it. I think it's a spectacular movie. Definitely
the best Thor movie. I will fight you if you

633
00:56:14,645 --> 00:56:18,927
say it's Thor Ragnarok, because you are wrong.
You don't have to fight me, man. Right there

634
00:56:18,947 --> 00:56:25,250
with you. Sweet. Not that you would win anyway.
Oh, dude, I would totally stop you. That does

635
00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:29,252

00:57:13,168 --> 00:57:18,332
have a lot to do with like mental illusions,
so it should be fun. And this of course is
