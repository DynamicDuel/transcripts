00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:25,038 --> 00:00:29,742
Welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:35,147
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:35,607 --> 00:00:42,273
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous
Joe. And in this episode, we are doing a duel

5
00:00:42,554 --> 00:00:48,259
between the characters of Blockbuster and Tombstone.
And I know what you're thinking, but you're

6
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:54,748
wrong. This is not, in fact, a battle. between
a 90s era video store and a frozen pizza company,

7
00:00:55,269 --> 00:01:00,533
it is comic book characters. Obscure ones, but
comic book characters nonetheless. I don't

8
00:01:00,553 --> 00:01:04,516
think Tombstone is that obscure. He's a pretty
prominent Spider-Man and Daredevil villain.

9
00:01:04,937 --> 00:01:09,641
I mean, he was in the, into the Spider-Verse
movie. I totally blocked that. Blockbuster

10
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:15,725
actually has been in a few animated works before,
so maybe he's not that obscure either. That

11
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:21,302
said, when I Google Blockbuster, the first thing
that comes up is not the DC character. Same

12
00:01:21,322 --> 00:01:26,246
thing with Tombstone, so fair enough. Now this
duel was specifically requested by our executive

13
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:30,670
producer, Miggy Mathagean. We'll break down
the characters' histories and abilities and

14
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:34,213
run a thousand simulations to find out who would
actually win. Before that, we're gonna break

15
00:01:34,233 --> 00:01:38,757
down the comic book movie news from the past
week, of which there was just one news item,

16
00:01:39,157 --> 00:01:45,342
and that was that the Sandman series for Netflix
is ending with season two. Yeah, the day this

17
00:01:45,382 --> 00:01:50,066
episode drops, we're supposed to get the first
teaser trailer for the Fantastic Four first

18
00:01:50,106 --> 00:01:55,010
steps movie that's coming out later this summer,
but, you know, that's just our luck. So next

19
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,993
week we'll be talking about the teaser, but
as always, we list our segment times in our

week, hosts Scotty and Gilly are finding out
who would win in a fight between the MCU's

34
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:17,107
Spider-Man and the DCEU's Blue Beetle. That's
right, they're doing a Marvel versus DC episode.

35
00:03:17,587 --> 00:03:22,268
Totally here for it. Can't wait to see Tom Holland's
Spider-Man wipe the floor with Trilla Mardi

36
00:03:22,308 --> 00:03:27,202
Doignes' Blue Beetle. Yeah, that's not gonna
happen. We've run that battle. I'm pretty confident

37
00:03:27,262 --> 00:03:31,647
I know who comes out on top. We ran the comic
book character battle, but who wins between

38
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:37,553
the movie characters? I'm still pretty confident.
Well you're done. On the Senjoh World Podcast,

But with that out of the way, quick to the No
Prize! A No Prize is an award Marvel used to

46
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:20,431
give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Dual
No Prize, is a digital award we post on Instagram

47
00:04:20,451 --> 00:04:25,314
for the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week we asked

48
00:04:25,334 --> 00:04:31,799
you guys, which actor has given the best performance
in a villain role for a Marvel or DC series?

49
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,102
And we got four answers, so let's go over our
three honorable mentions as well as the no

50
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:42,566
prize winner. Our first honorable mention goes
to Lee Tapscott, who said, Hi, this is Lee

51
00:04:42,626 --> 00:04:50,299
Tapscott about which actor performances was
the best villain. I think David Tennant as

52
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:58,183
Kilgrave, aka Purple Man, in the Jessica Jones
series, you grew to hate him and he was perhaps

53
00:04:58,223 --> 00:05:03,506
the first villain we wanted to see the hero
actually kill. Yeah, I mean, this was one of

54
00:05:03,526 --> 00:05:07,848
the answers to beat, right? Kilgrave, aka the
Purple Man from the Jessica Jones television

55
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:13,071
series, was played masterfully by David Tennant,
who is, you know, a pretty charismatic actor,

56
00:05:13,131 --> 00:05:18,470
but by God, was he easy to hate in the course
of that show. Yeah, I don't know if anyone

57
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,473
else could have played that role besides David
Tennant, honestly. It probably would have ruined

58
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:28,236
their career, just with all the horrible things
that the character did. Right. But when you

59
00:05:28,276 --> 00:05:32,638
have someone like David Tennant who really choose
the scenery with the role, he can kind of get

60
00:05:32,678 --> 00:05:37,721
by considering the subject matter. His influence
was so lasting in that show that it carried

61
00:05:37,842 --> 00:05:42,304
on within the subsequent seasons of Jessica
Jones. There were only three seasons of Jessica

62
00:05:42,344 --> 00:05:46,786
Jones, but his presence was still definitely
felt. Great answer, Lee. Our next honorable

63
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:53,188
mention goes to Clive, who said. Hi, this is
Clive from Toronto. Without putting too much

64
00:05:53,248 --> 00:05:58,509
thought into it, the villain that comes to mind
is Deathstroke in the Arrow TV show, specifically

65
00:05:58,549 --> 00:06:02,691
in the earlier seasons. I just remember feeling
like the stakes were really high when this

66
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:07,792
character was on screen. It really surprised
me when he killed a significant character on

67
00:06:07,812 --> 00:06:14,322
the show, no spoilers, but in that single action,
it showed me that this man was no joke. Yeah,

68
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:19,344
Slade Wilson aka Deathstroke played by Manu
Bennett in the Arrow television series was

69
00:06:19,384 --> 00:06:24,247
a force to be reckoned with. The story arc of
getting to know the character in the flashbacks

70
00:06:24,647 --> 00:06:30,270
on the island with Oliver Queen to when he became
a full-fledged horror monster type villain

71
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:36,093
in subsequent seasons where it seemed like no
character was safe from being killed by Deathstroke

72
00:06:36,474 --> 00:06:41,576
was just remarkable. You never knew when or
where he was going to appear and that was part

73
00:06:41,737 --> 00:06:45,667
of why the character was so scary. I've never
seen the Arrow television series, but I've

74
00:06:45,707 --> 00:06:49,611
always heard good things about the Deathstroke
character from that show. And there have been

75
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:55,456
several live action iterations of Deathstroke.
Like we got him in Titan season two, as well

76
00:06:55,516 --> 00:07:00,540
as like the post credit scene in the Justice
League film. But yeah, Manu Burnett's portrayal

77
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,125
is largely regarded as the best. Yeah, the Arrowverse
version is still the best. Great answer Clive.

78
00:07:06,205 --> 00:07:12,734
Our next honorable mention goes to Mike Williams,
who said, Hi guys, Mike Williams here. I picked

79
00:07:12,774 --> 00:07:20,961
Clancy Brown for Lex Luthor in the Justice League
Unlimited series and Oswald Patton for Modoc.

80
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:26,266
Have a good day. Yeah, we didn't say specifically
that these had to be live action performances.

81
00:07:26,646 --> 00:07:33,212
So Mike Williams gave us two animated performances,
first with Clancy Brown as Lex Luthor and Patton

82
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:39,986
Oswald as Modoc. Yeah, Clancy Brown to Lex Luthor
is what Kevin Conroy is to Batman. He's just

83
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:45,287
the iconic voice for that role. It's hard to
hear anybody else when you read the lines in

84
00:07:45,307 --> 00:07:51,049
the comics. And Patton Oswalt played the character
of Modok so much better than how the character

85
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:56,910
was portrayed in live action in the Ant-Man
and the Wasp quantumania film. To me, the Hulu-Modok

86
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,531
stop-motion animation depiction of the character
is the quintessential version. Yeah, I've never

87
00:08:01,591 --> 00:08:06,933
seen if Patton Oswalt has ever said anything
about the MCU version of Modok, but you have

88
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:12,255
to imagine he was pretty embarrassed when he
saw it. Like embarrassed for Kevin Feige and

89
00:08:12,295 --> 00:08:16,177
Marvel Studios. Yeah, they definitely didn't
have to go that route. If I had my way, the

90
00:08:16,197 --> 00:08:20,059
character never would have taken off his faceplate.
Because with the faceplate, it was actually

91
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:25,222
a pretty cool design for live action. But yeah,
the Modok Hulu series was just fantastic. Great

92
00:08:25,282 --> 00:08:31,366
answer, Mike. But the winner of this week's
Snow Prize is Buster Barnes. Who said? Hi,

93
00:08:31,406 --> 00:08:35,208
guys, Buster Barnes here. And for my pick, I'm
going to go for a bit of an underrated shout,

94
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:41,323
which is Cronden, who plays Tobias Wail in The
Black Lightning Show, a pretty underrated show

95
00:08:41,403 --> 00:08:47,446
and a very underrated villain. He was menacing,
imposing, intimidating for a guy who didn't

96
00:08:47,466 --> 00:08:53,450
really have any acting credits before this show.
I think he was a great villain and yeah, I

97
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:57,932
think it's a really underrated performance.
See you guys. Love the show. Yeah. Crandon,

98
00:08:57,992 --> 00:09:04,355
I believe is a rapper. He's a musician by profession,
but honestly, I can't think of anyone better

99
00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:09,310
to play the role of Tobias Whale for the Black
Lightning series. I didn't watch the whole

100
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:15,793
series, but the episodes I did watch, Cronden
made a fantastic kingpin-esque villain, just

101
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:21,415
in terms of striking and imposing figure and
intimidation factor. Yeah, I never watched

102
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:25,977
the Black Lightning television series, so I
only know of his version of Tobias Whale through

103
00:09:25,997 --> 00:09:30,779
the marketing of the show. And yeah, it looked
like it was a pretty good performance. I don't

104
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:35,381
know too much about Tobias Whale in general.
I do remember that he was in the Suicide Squad,

105
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:40,283
hell to pay. animated movie and he was pretty
imposing in that as well. But the reason that

106
00:09:40,323 --> 00:09:46,024
Buster Barnes' answer gets the no prize this
week is because Crandon also voiced the character

107
00:09:46,064 --> 00:09:52,186
of Tombstone in the Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse
movie. So it was a pretty topical answer considering

108
00:09:52,546 --> 00:09:56,908
that in this episode we're pitting Tombstone
against Blockbuster. I thought it was interesting

109
00:09:56,968 --> 00:10:04,398
that Crandon is an albino African-American and
so is Tobias Whale and Tombstone. So he's kind

110
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:09,405
of like the perfect guy to play and voice those
characters. So congrats to Buster Barnes. You

111
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:13,912
win this week's No Prize. If you the listener
want a shot at winning your own No Prize, stay

112
00:10:13,932 --> 00:10:18,418
tuned to later on in this episode when we'll
be asking another question of the week. But

113
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,481
now that that's done, on to the news.

114
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,933
So if you remember listening to our last episode,
I mentioned that my most anticipated series

115
00:10:31,373 --> 00:10:36,357
of this year is probably Sandman season 2. I
wasn't sure if we were going to get it, but

116
00:10:36,377 --> 00:10:42,401
it sounds like we are, and that this upcoming
season will in fact be the final season of

117
00:10:42,441 --> 00:10:49,125
the series. Which to me was heartbreaking, because
I know Sandman, the story written by Neil Gaiman,

118
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:56,590
is a 10 volume series, so for it to end on season
2 felt very premature. and since it's one of

119
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:01,871
my favorite series, I felt like they were just
making a huge mistake. Initially, I was under

120
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:07,373
the assumption that the show's conclusion was
coming about because of several sexual misconduct

121
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:13,495
accusations leveled at Neil Gaiman, and that
may very well be why they decided to announce

122
00:11:13,615 --> 00:11:18,976
at this time that the series is concluding,
but according to Variety, they were actually

123
00:11:19,016 --> 00:11:24,626
planning on ending with season 2 prior to these
allegations coming out. Yeah, the series of

124
00:11:24,686 --> 00:11:29,348
Sandman is like 10 volumes, but only so much
of that story actually deals directly with

125
00:11:29,709 --> 00:11:34,811
the character of Dream, right? Like a lot of
the story is somewhat anthological to my understanding.

126
00:11:35,231 --> 00:11:39,534
So the show producers released a statement saying
that since they're focusing really on the character

127
00:11:39,574 --> 00:11:44,596
of Dream, they're skipping over a lot of the
other stuff and are able to, I guess, tell

128
00:11:44,656 --> 00:11:50,122
his complete arc within this next season. Now
initially I was calling BS on that reasoning.

129
00:11:50,202 --> 00:11:55,464
I thought that was just a political way to say,
hey, we're going to end this series because

130
00:11:55,544 --> 00:12:00,285
of Neil Gaiman's alleged conduct. But according
to Variety, they were hearing from sources

131
00:12:00,505 --> 00:12:06,007
that the series was getting too pricey to continue.
So that's why they decided to focus solely

132
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:12,328
on Dream Story, which, yeah, there's not as
much to Dream Story specifically in the series

133
00:12:12,408 --> 00:12:18,483
run as you would think for a series titled The
Sandman. So I could kind of buy that. I totally

134
00:12:18,503 --> 00:12:22,865
believe that it's an expensive show because
it does look amazing. All the special effects

135
00:12:22,965 --> 00:12:27,487
and the production value is pretty incredible.
Yeah, the show is very cinematic, very special

136
00:12:27,527 --> 00:12:31,830
effects heavy. I think season one was the most
expensive season of a show that Warner Brothers

137
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:36,912
had ever produced in fact. So yeah, I guess
this should not be shocking. We did not get

138
00:12:36,932 --> 00:12:41,655
a release date for this season with this news,
although we do know it's coming out in 2025.

139
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:48,596
We did however get a poster, which is pretty
bad ass all seven members of the Endless on

140
00:12:48,656 --> 00:12:54,964
it. Everyone from death to despair, delirium,
desire, destiny, and destruction. It's pretty

141
00:12:55,004 --> 00:12:58,929
awesome to see live-action versions of each
of these characters, and I can't wait to see

142
00:12:58,969 --> 00:13:04,095
them in the series itself. But with the announcement
that this is the final season of The Sandman,

143
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:06,197
that brings us to our question of the week.

144
00:13:10,894 --> 00:13:16,098

series that you most wish would have gotten

145

Dynamic Duel No Prize that we'll post to Instagram.
Be sure to answer before... February 8th.

150
00:13:49,006 --> 00:13:53,494
That does it for all the news for this episode,
so now let's move on to our main event, where

151
00:13:53,554 --> 00:14:00,607
we find out who would win in a battle between
the DC Villain Blockbuster and the Marvel Villain

152
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:01,649
Tombstone.

153
00:14:16,902 --> 00:14:24,844
Okay, Blockbuster and Tombstone. These are two
broodish mobster villains. One is the primary

154
00:14:24,884 --> 00:14:30,125
villain you could say for Nightwing and Tombstone,
as I've recently learned, is a villain for

155
00:14:30,145 --> 00:14:34,627
characters like Daredevil and Spider-Man. So
it's kind of fitting because we actually pit

156
00:14:34,887 --> 00:14:39,408
the characters of Nightwing and Daredevil in
a duel prior to this and now it looks like

157
00:14:39,428 --> 00:14:43,109
their villains are facing off against each other.
Oh yeah, I didn't really think about that before

158
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:46,950
but you're totally right. I don't know much
about the character of Blockbuster actually.

159
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:52,652
I don't think I've read a single DC comic with
him as the villain. So I'm basically going

160
00:14:52,752 --> 00:14:57,273
into this from scratch. It'll be really interesting
to learn exactly who this character is before

161
00:14:57,353 --> 00:15:03,515
facing off against Tombstone. Basically Blockbuster
looks like they kind of just ripped off Tombstone,

162
00:15:03,815 --> 00:15:08,416
but instead of having like this fade haircut,
it's long hair. Yeah. In this episode, we're

163
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:14,494
going to find out who would win in a battle
between a mullet and a flat top. But to explain

164
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:18,956
the methodology behind our duels, let's go to
our sentient dual simulator, Alfred Jarvis

165
00:15:19,036 --> 00:15:24,199
9000. AJ9K, tell our listeners how you go about
determining a winner in our dual matchups.

166
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:29,322
Yes, of course, sir. The way I determine a winner
between the contestants is by running 1000

167
00:15:29,802 --> 00:15:35,486
Monte Carlo simulations using the characters
statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic

168
00:15:35,526 --> 00:15:41,069
model used to determine outcomes through random
sampling. In this case, I randomized the statistics

169
00:15:41,109 --> 00:15:45,778
along a normal distribution. as a way to simulate
the many variables that can occur during battle.

170
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:50,940
The stat parameters are based on the official
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters

171
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:56,142
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat
categories are included such as range, damage

172
00:15:56,182 --> 00:16:01,583
potential, versatility and perception in order
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.

173
00:16:02,063 --> 00:16:06,865
The results of the 1000 simulations provide
a percentage of wins for each character. The

174
00:16:06,905 --> 00:16:11,350
contestant with the higher percentage is declared
the victor. as they have a higher probability

175
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:17,232
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,
neither character should win 100% of the matches.

176
00:16:17,732 --> 00:16:22,213
The comic book stories have shown that there's
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so

177
00:16:22,253 --> 00:16:26,134
the confidence rate of my method falls in line
with the precedents that have been established

178
00:16:26,154 --> 00:16:31,716
in the source material. My mathematical simulations
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are

179
00:16:31,756 --> 00:16:36,117
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes
tabulated for determination of the winner.

180
00:16:37,506 --> 00:16:42,168
Thanks AJ9K! Before we run the simulations though,
we like to break down each character's histories

181
00:16:42,188 --> 00:16:47,611
and abilities before improvising a scenario
on how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations

182
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:52,334
would play out beat for beat. And I believe
it's my turn to go first with the Marvel characters

183
00:16:52,374 --> 00:16:58,978
backstory, so let me go ahead and tell you guys
all about Tombstone. Now Alonso Thompson Lincoln

184
00:16:59,138 --> 00:17:03,921
was born in Harlem in New York City, where his
journey into the criminal underworld began

185
00:17:04,021 --> 00:17:10,264
at an early age. As an African-American albino,
he stood out among his peers, becoming a target

186
00:17:10,304 --> 00:17:15,686
for bullying. Rather than shrink from adversity,
however, he turned it into his weapon, training

187
00:17:15,706 --> 00:17:20,768
his body into an intimidating size and using
his natural strength to extort his classmates.

188
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:26,291
The only person who ever showed him any kindness
was Joseph Robbie Robertson, who would later

189
00:17:26,331 --> 00:17:31,373
grow to work for the Daily Bugle newspaper.
That kindness ended when Robertson, the editor

190
00:17:31,413 --> 00:17:37,251
of the school paper, attempted to publish an
expose on Lincoln's violent behavior. Feeling

191
00:17:37,271 --> 00:17:42,092
betrayed, Lincoln silenced Robbie through intimidation,
a moment that would set the stage for their

192
00:17:42,132 --> 00:17:47,914
lifelong enmity. Lincoln dropped out of school
and dove headfirst into a life of crime. His

193
00:17:47,954 --> 00:17:52,716
imposing stature and ruthless demeanor made
him a natural enforcer, and his reputation

194
00:17:52,736 --> 00:17:58,337
for brutality only grew. As he climbed the ranks
of organized crime, he sharpened his teeth

195
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:04,629
into points. and trained as a hand-to-hand combatant,
specializing in strangulation. He soon earned

196
00:18:04,689 --> 00:18:10,793
the moniker Tombstone, both for his pale complexion
and the countless bodies he left in his wake.

197
00:18:11,213 --> 00:18:15,796
Tombstone's rise to power led him to Philadelphia,
where he crossed paths with Robbie Robertson

198
00:18:15,957 --> 00:18:21,800
once again. Now a journalist, Robertson witnessed
Tombstone murder a crime informant, but, paralyzed

199
00:18:21,841 --> 00:18:24,823
by fear, chose to remain silent for decades.

200
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:35,811
working for the likes of Wilson Fisk, the Magia,
and Hammerhead. Despite numerous arrests, Lincoln

201
00:18:35,931 --> 00:18:40,736
always managed to evade conviction, often due
to witness intimidation or the sheer terror

202
00:18:40,756 --> 00:18:45,580
he instilled in those who might testify against
him. Years later, Robertson, haunted by his

203
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:52,046
past inaction, decided to finally expose Tombstone.
His confession led to Tombstone's first major

204
00:18:52,086 --> 00:18:57,202
incarceration, but it also landed Robbie in
prison for withholding evidence. Tombstone

205
00:18:57,222 --> 00:19:03,123
arranged for his own transfer to the same prison,
where he terrorized Robertson until the intervention

206
00:19:03,223 --> 00:19:09,165
of a fellow inmate, Bruiser. When Bruiser attempted
to protect Robbie, Tombstone brutally murdered

207
00:19:09,205 --> 00:19:13,966
him. However, Robertson ultimately found the
courage to stand up to his tormentor. When

208
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:19,328
they both escaped prison, he confronted Tombstone
in battle, battling him with a pitchfork and

209
00:19:19,368 --> 00:19:24,874
finally escaping his grip. Tombstone resurfaced
in New York, working under Hammerhead. and

210
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:30,116
later attempting to assassinate Robertson himself.
However, a fateful accident at an Oscorp chemical

211
00:19:30,156 --> 00:19:36,919
plant changed him forever. Locked inside a chamber
with an experimental gas called DIOX-3, Tombstone's

212
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:43,381
physiology mutated, giving him near invulnerable
skin, increased strength, and enhanced speed.

213
00:19:43,781 --> 00:19:49,644
While the process made him virtually indestructible,
it also gave him a terrifying stone-like complexion,

214
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:55,306
cementing his legend as one of New York's deadliest
criminals. With his new abilities, Tombstone

215
00:19:55,346 --> 00:20:00,107
fought Spider-Man on multiple occasions, as
well as other street level heroes like Daredevil

216
00:20:00,307 --> 00:20:05,669
and Luke Cage. He even sought purpose with the
Hand, engaging in an assassination competition

217
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:11,230
against Taskmaster, only to be thwarted by Daredevil
and the Punisher. You can learn more about

218
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:15,731
Spider-Man in his duel against Blue Beetle,
Daredevil in his duel against Nightwing, Luke

219
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:20,793
Cage in his duel against Thunder, Taskmaster
in his duel against Prometheus, and Punisher

220
00:20:20,813 --> 00:20:25,542
in his duel against Red Hood. Over the years,
Lincoln would continuously attempt to carve

221
00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:30,044
out his own empire. He was one of the many gang
leaders present during the downfall of the

222
00:20:30,064 --> 00:20:35,825
Kingpin attempting to claim a portion of Wilson
Fisk's empire. Tombstone also formed alliances

223
00:20:35,865 --> 00:20:40,847
with the Hood's criminal army, flashing with
Mr. Negative in a bid for power. However, he

224
00:20:40,887 --> 00:20:46,649
was repeatedly thwarted by Spider-Man and other
heroes, leading to multiple incarcerations.

225
00:20:46,669 --> 00:20:51,728
Tombstone's personal life remained complex.
He had a daughter, Janice Lincoln, whom he

226
00:20:51,768 --> 00:20:56,612
trained in crime and deception from an early
age. Although he hoped she would use her cunning

227
00:20:56,652 --> 00:21:01,697
for financial gain as a lawyer, she instead
chose to become the supervillain Beetle, much

228
00:21:01,737 --> 00:21:06,422
to his frustration. His relationship with Robbie
Robertson also took an unexpected turn when

229
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:11,787
Janice began dating Robbie's son, Randy. This
forced the two lifelong enemies into an uneasy

230
00:21:11,827 --> 00:21:17,031
truce to avoid interfering in their children's
lives. Tombstone's reputation as an unbreakable

231
00:21:17,071 --> 00:21:21,395
enforcer was put to the test when he was shot
at his daughter's wedding, revealing that his

232
00:21:21,455 --> 00:21:27,340
bulletproof durability had diminished over time.
This attack ignited a gang war as Tombstone's

233
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:33,244
rival saw his vulnerability as an opportunity
to seize his criminal empire. Despite his injuries,

234
00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:38,369
he remained active in the ongoing conflict,
working to reclaim lost territory and eliminate

235
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:43,493
his challengers. His conflicts with Spider-Man
persisted as the wall-crawler frequently disrupted

236
00:21:43,533 --> 00:21:48,207
his operations. Tombstone was also targeted
by law enforcement, including detective Yuri

237
00:21:48,227 --> 00:21:52,789
Watanabe, the vigilante known as Wraith, who
sought justice after he critically injured

238
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:57,831
one of her colleagues. Despite being temporarily
imprisoned, Tombstone leveraged his deep-rooted

239
00:21:57,851 --> 00:22:03,813
connections to manipulate the legal system and
escape. Powers-wise, Tombstone's body was physically

240
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:08,415
enhanced through the DIOX-3 chemical, which
grants him enough strength to lift around 6

241
00:22:08,455 --> 00:22:13,717
tons, as well as give him increased durability
with Stoneheart skin and increased resistance

242
00:22:13,757 --> 00:22:19,007
to toxins. He's a skilled marksman with his
commonly used twin pistols, and he's a highly

243
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:24,148
experienced street fighter. And that's Tombstone.
So was it never explained why all of a sudden

244
00:22:24,188 --> 00:22:29,650
he was able to be shot despite prior to that
having like rock hard skin? Yeah, that was

245
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:35,532
during a time when his powers were temporarily
diminished. But traditionally, the character

246
00:22:35,732 --> 00:22:41,013
is known for having stone skin, and that's how
he'll be portrayed in this match. OK, convenient.

247
00:22:42,702 --> 00:22:48,526
Blockbuster doesn't normally carry guns. He's
a weapon unto himself essentially. Although

248
00:22:48,546 --> 00:22:52,649
you would think he would, it would make his
life a lot easier. Let me get into Blockbuster's

249
00:22:52,669 --> 00:23:00,214
history. Now Mark Desmond, a frail yet brilliant
chemist, devoted himself to developing a serum

250
00:23:00,494 --> 00:23:05,978
that would grant him immense physical power.
His experiments proved successful, drastically

251
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:12,310
increasing his strength, durability, and size,
but at the cost of his intellect. The transformation

252
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:17,873
left him barely capable of coherent speech,
however, turning him into a mindless brute.

253
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:23,757
His older brother, Roland Desmond, who possessed
a criminal mind and ambitions of wealth and

254
00:23:23,797 --> 00:23:29,040
power, took advantage of Mark's new condition.
Shielding their mother from the truth about

255
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:35,264
Mark's monstrous transformation, Roland manipulated
his brother into committing crimes on his behalf.

256
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:40,408
Operating in Gotham City, It wasn't long before
the Desmond brothers caught the attention of

257
00:23:40,468 --> 00:23:45,492
Batman and Robin, who you can learn more about
in their duels against Moon Knight and Daredevil,

258
00:23:45,553 --> 00:23:51,958
respectively. Mark's rampages made him a formidable
opponent, but Batman discovered a way to pacify

259
00:23:52,018 --> 00:23:58,323
him. Years earlier, Bruce Wayne had rescued
Mark from drowning in quicksand. When Batman

260
00:23:58,383 --> 00:24:03,948
removed his cowl to reveal his face, the sight
of Bruce triggered a memory in Mark of the

261
00:24:03,988 --> 00:24:09,492
man who had once saved him. momentarily calming
the beast and preventing further destruction.

262
00:24:09,972 --> 00:24:15,015
After multiple encounters with Batman, Mark
was ultimately set to the Alfred Foundation

263
00:24:15,055 --> 00:24:21,058
for treatment, where scientists unsuccessfully
attempted to find a way to reverse his condition.

264
00:24:21,518 --> 00:24:27,181
Seeking solace, Mark began living a life of
isolation, though his mind was easily influenced.

265
00:24:27,702 --> 00:24:33,705
The Outsider, an enemy of Batman, manipulated
Mark into fighting the Dark Knight again, but

266
00:24:33,745 --> 00:24:40,312
Batman once more at- but Batman once more outwitted
his foe. After his defeat, Mark was transferred

267
00:24:40,392 --> 00:24:46,394
to Star Labs for further treatment. The scientists
there attempted to use radiation therapy to

268
00:24:46,414 --> 00:24:52,416
restore his original mind, but the experiment
failed, seemingly killing him. Mark was buried

269
00:24:52,476 --> 00:24:58,419
in Gotham Cemetery, though it was later revealed
that his death was a sham. Mark had been revived

270
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:04,321
and left the city, eventually finding work in
a West Virginia mining town. He lived there

271
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:10,982
in peace, until Batman tracked him down. Initially
enraged at the sight of Batman, Mark's aggression

272
00:25:11,022 --> 00:25:16,427
was neutralized when his fellow miners became
trapped in a cave-in. Working together, Batman

273
00:25:16,447 --> 00:25:22,152
and Mark rescued them, and Mark helped capture
the men responsible for the disaster. Recognizing

274
00:25:22,172 --> 00:25:27,016
that Mark had found a life where he could do
no harm, Batman allowed him to stay in the

275
00:25:27,056 --> 00:25:32,640
town rather than return him to Gotham. However,
Mark would later be recruited into Amanda Waller's

276
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:39,265
suicide squad, and sent to fight the powerful
entity known as Brimstone. During the battle,

277
00:25:39,686 --> 00:25:46,290
Brimstone burned Mark alive, killing him. Following
Mark's death, his brother Roland Desvend, now

278
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:52,815
suffering from a rare genetic disorder, sought
a cure for his deteriorating condition. Turning

279
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:59,880
to experimental steroids similar to his brother's
serum, Roland transformed into the second Blockbuster,

280
00:26:00,321 --> 00:26:06,759
possessing immense strength. by suffering the
same intellectual deterioration as Mark. However,

281
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:12,700
unlike his brother, Roland regained his intelligence
after striking a deal with the demon Neuron,

282
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:19,142
who enhanced his mind in exchange for his soul.
With his newfound intellect and strength, Roland

283
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:24,824
sought to carve out his own criminal empire.
He moved to Bluthaven, a city riddled with

284
00:26:24,864 --> 00:26:31,065
corruption, and systemically eliminated rival
crime bosses to establish himself as its undisputed

285
00:26:31,165 --> 00:26:37,523
ruler. His rise to power coincided with Nightwing's
arrival in the city, and the two clashed with

286
00:26:37,583 --> 00:26:43,805
Nightwing working to dismantle Roland's operations.
After years of conflict, Roland's body began

287
00:26:43,845 --> 00:26:50,407
to suffer from the strain of his immense bulk,
developing albinism and a heart condition as

288
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:56,668
side effects of his treatments. Seeking a cure,
he traveled to Gorilla City, where he underwent

289
00:26:56,768 --> 00:27:04,843
a heart transplant to prolong his life. He launched
a personal vendetta against Nightwing, systematically

290
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:10,404
targeting the people closest to him, orchestrating
attacks against Nightwing's allies and loved

291
00:27:10,524 --> 00:27:15,886
ones, and working to break him mentally and
emotionally. During their final confrontation,

292
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:22,288
a new vigilante known as Tarantula intervened.
With Nightwing exhausted and psychologically

293
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:27,829
shattered, she executed Blockbuster in front
of him. The police investigation into Roland's

294
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:33,264
death was minimal, and his criminal empire quickly
crumbled in the wake of his murder. However,

295
00:27:33,304 --> 00:27:38,887
during the events of Blackest Night, Roland
was resurrected as a Black Lantern and returned

296
00:27:38,947 --> 00:27:44,570
to Gotham City alongside other undead villains.
He and other Black Lanterns were ultimately

297
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:50,213
defeated, however, and his corpse returned to
rest. After the Flash created a Flashpoint

298
00:27:50,273 --> 00:27:56,877
event that reset DC's continuity, Mark Desmond
was reintroduced as a test subject for a mysterious

299
00:27:56,917 --> 00:28:02,960
doctor named Fane. Undergoing procedures meant
to enhance his intelligence, Mark was exposed

300
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:08,723
to an overdose of a chemical compound that transformed
him into a hulking brew. Rampaging through

301
00:28:08,763 --> 00:28:14,206
Washington, D.C., he came into conflict with
Hawk and Dove before being subdued by Batman

302
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:18,949
and Robin. You can learn more about Hawk and
Dove in our Hawk and Dove versus Northstar

303
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:25,293
and Aurora episode. Later, Mark became a member
of the Secret Society, an organization of supervillains

304
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:30,551
assembled by the Crime Syndicate. He was sent
to battle Lex Luthor's Injustice League during

305
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:36,393
the crime syndicate's reign over Earth. Roland
Desmond also resurfaced, also taking on the

306
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:42,536
mantle of Blockbuster, though his version maintained
his intelligence without requiring a deal with

307
00:28:42,636 --> 00:28:48,218
Neuron. He became the leader of Bloodhaven's
criminal underworld, positioning himself as

308
00:28:48,318 --> 00:28:54,280
Nightwing's primary adversary. After Dick Grayson
publicly revealed himself to be a billionaire

309
00:28:54,641 --> 00:29:00,783
and pledged to rebuild Bloodhaven, Roland saw
him as a threat to his control. He attempted

310
00:29:00,803 --> 00:29:06,986
to have Dick assassinated, but failed, as multiple
superheroes came to Dick's aid. When Blockbuster

311
00:29:07,006 --> 00:29:12,548
sought to personally kill Dick, he attacked
the Haven Community Center, leading to a climactic

312
00:29:12,568 --> 00:29:18,010
battle with Nightwing. During the fight, Roland
knocked off Nightwing's mask and discovered

313
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:24,193
his secret identity. Despite this revelation,
Nightwing defeated Roland in combat. His grip

314
00:29:24,273 --> 00:29:29,068
over Blewd Haven soon collapsed, and his own
henchmen turned against him when they learned

315
00:29:29,088 --> 00:29:33,872
of Blockbuster's corrupt dealings with the private
prison. Fleeing into the city's back alleys,

316
00:29:34,132 --> 00:29:39,076
Blockbuster encountered the villain Heartless,
who had been targeting powerful individuals

317
00:29:39,196 --> 00:29:45,481
in Bloodhaven. Heartless killed Roland, taking
his heart as a trophy, and unknowingly ensuring

318
00:29:45,741 --> 00:29:50,845
that the seeker of Nightwing's identity died
with him. Now powers-wise, both versions of

319
00:29:50,905 --> 00:29:57,186
Blockbuster possess immense superhuman strength,
durability, and stamina. capable of lifting

320
00:29:57,326 --> 00:30:03,268
several tons. Blockbuster is also a formidable
hand-to-hand combatant, and the Roland version,

321
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:09,651
which is the version I'm going with, is a criminal
mastermind. That's Blockbuster. Okay, so I

322
00:30:09,671 --> 00:30:14,573
mentioned earlier that I wasn't really too familiar
with the character of Blockbuster, having never

323
00:30:14,673 --> 00:30:21,096
read any stories with him, and after that bio,
I'm kinda glad, because that was boring. Okay,

324
00:30:21,256 --> 00:30:27,144
same with Tombstone, like who gives a shit?
Tombstone at least looks cool. Okay, Blockbuster

325
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:32,496
is not a character that looks cool. Spoken like
someone incapable of rocking a mullet. That's

326
00:30:32,536 --> 00:30:36,985
exactly what a jealous non-mullet person would
say. Fair enough.

327
00:30:43,918 --> 00:30:49,580

podcast network rises above the rest. Prepare

Visit dynamicpodcast.com where we settle the
debate and settle the score.

334
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:34,992
Now that we've got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

335
00:31:35,012 --> 00:31:40,935
of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not this speculation,

336
00:31:41,355 --> 00:31:46,678
but it's fun to imagine how the fight could
play out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?

337
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:51,581
Well, I should say there are no rules, other
than the characters have no prior knowledge

338
00:31:51,621 --> 00:31:56,003
of the other going into the fight. All they
are aware of starting out is that the other

339
00:31:56,043 --> 00:32:00,870
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.
For the speculation... The contestants will

340
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:06,214
begin approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript
environment that will have no bearing on the

341
00:32:06,254 --> 00:32:11,599
match itself, as no environmental statistics
are considered in my simulations. The contestants

342
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:17,163
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright
then let's get into it! Blockbuster and Tombstone

343
00:32:17,203 --> 00:32:22,808
meet on the battlefield. Who goes first? I'm
gonna say Tombstone goes first because he has

344
00:32:22,968 --> 00:32:30,346
guns. So with this like creepy ass smile, he's
gonna brandish his two pistols. like spinning

345
00:32:30,386 --> 00:32:35,407
them up and pointing them right at Blockbuster
before smoking that fool like it ain't no thing.

346
00:32:35,427 --> 00:32:42,309
I mean, that's like firing handguns at a charging
rhino, though, because once Blockbuster sees

347
00:32:42,389 --> 00:32:46,790
Tombstone brandish those guns, he's going to
know that he needs to close the gap between

348
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:52,232
them. And he probably figures that his imposing
size would probably make him like physically

349
00:32:52,292 --> 00:32:58,333
superior to Tombstone. So Blockbuster, he's
going to rush Tombstone and get tagged a few

350
00:32:58,373 --> 00:33:03,668
times. with bullets, sure, but it's nothing
serious enough to stop him from grabbing Tombstone's

351
00:33:03,708 --> 00:33:08,831
guns and just hurling them towards the horizon.
But wait, what makes you think Tombstone's

352
00:33:08,851 --> 00:33:14,834
guns are that easy to grab? Like, Tombstone's
known for his unbreakable grip, right? So like,

353
00:33:15,335 --> 00:33:20,637
Blockbuster tries to snatch Tombstone's guns
from his hands, but Tombstone's gonna use that

354
00:33:20,717 --> 00:33:25,660
moment to straight up kick Blockbuster right
in his Nard sack. And when Blockbuster drops

355
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,411
to his knees in front of him because of the
pain... Tombstone is just gonna pistol whip

356
00:33:30,431 --> 00:33:37,955
him right across the face. No dude, Blockbuster,
he has balls of steel. So he just no sells

357
00:33:38,175 --> 00:33:43,698
that cheap nut shot. And while he's grabbing
Tombstone's guns, he's gonna crush the metal

358
00:33:43,798 --> 00:33:50,362
barrels in his hands. Just rendering them useless.
Before headbutting Tombstone right in the face,

359
00:33:50,902 --> 00:33:55,965
knocking him backward. Headbutting Tombstone
is like the last thing you want to do. Because

360
00:33:56,225 --> 00:34:01,488
one... Tombstone's head is as durable as a stone,
so it's gonna be like headbutting a rock. And

361
00:34:01,568 --> 00:34:09,674
two, Tombstone has sharp ass teeth, so as Blockbuster's
like reeling from giving himself a concussion,

362
00:34:10,114 --> 00:34:14,036
Tombstone's gonna bite one of Blockbuster's
eyes just straight out of his head, and then

363
00:34:14,056 --> 00:34:20,681
he's gonna spit it out, just grinning real creepy
like a shark. Ah! Ah, damn. Well, Blockbuster,

364
00:34:20,801 --> 00:34:27,157
he's pissed. And that's when he's gonna grab
Tombstone by the legs and just start ragdolling

365
00:34:27,197 --> 00:34:32,082
him, slamming him into the ground repeatedly,
like what the Hulk did to Loki in Avengers.

366
00:34:32,482 --> 00:34:38,547
Right, but again, Tombstone's rock hard, so
this doesn't faze him too much. Yeah, dude.

367
00:34:38,867 --> 00:34:45,052
I don't wanna know that. His skin is as hard
as a rock, is what I'm saying. So, you know,

368
00:34:45,092 --> 00:34:50,017
he's durable enough to handle this attack without
being too hurt, and he's just gonna reach into

369
00:34:50,077 --> 00:34:56,123
one of his boots. and pull out a switchblade
that he uses to reach up and shank Blockbuster

370
00:34:56,183 --> 00:35:01,225
right in the gut with. And that's when Blockbuster's
just gonna yeet Tombstone, like, tossing him

371
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:06,746
like half a block away. And he's gonna pull
out the knife, which, thanks for the weapon,

372
00:35:07,406 --> 00:35:13,808
and he's gonna charge Tombstone and just slam
right into him knife first. Right. Okay, but

373
00:35:13,828 --> 00:35:19,366
the knife is gonna break. Blockbuster is not
a smart villain. Your mom's not a smart villain.

374
00:35:19,506 --> 00:35:25,208
And that's when Tombstone knees Blockbuster
in the gut, you know, making him bend forward,

375
00:35:25,228 --> 00:35:29,689
and then Tombstone's gonna drop his elbow onto
his head, and Blockbuster's gonna fall to the

376
00:35:29,729 --> 00:35:34,871
ground. And for his finishing move, Tombstone's
gonna curb stomp the guy, like not in the figurative

377
00:35:34,911 --> 00:35:40,653
sense, but in the very literal sense, Tombstone's
gonna curb stomp Blockbuster, cave his face

378
00:35:40,713 --> 00:35:47,015
in, and Tombstone wins the match. No, because
when Blockbuster is on the ground and he sees

379
00:35:47,035 --> 00:35:51,277
that he's about to get his head kicked in, he's
going to quickly sweep Tombstone's leg out

380
00:35:51,297 --> 00:35:55,579
from under him, and when he hits the ground,
Blockbuster is just going to shove his fingers

381
00:35:56,059 --> 00:36:01,101
right through Tombstone's eyes, through his
skull, into his brain, killing him, because

382
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:05,883
I'm guessing his eyeballs aren't rock hard.
Actually, that's, yeah, you would be correct

383
00:36:06,103 --> 00:36:10,805
in that assumption. But like, Blockbuster is
missing an eye, so he's going an eye for an

384
00:36:10,905 --> 00:36:15,785
eye here. but Ni for Ni leaves the whole world
blind. Yeah, Blockbuster probably does not

385
00:36:15,805 --> 00:36:22,690
give two shits about Gandhi. But we'll go ahead
and leave the match there. Either Tombstone

386
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:27,734
curb stomps Blockbuster or Blockbuster jams
his fingers into Tombstone's brain through

387
00:36:27,775 --> 00:36:32,699
his eyes. Two violent mobster characters, two
violent ways to end this match. But let's see

388
00:36:32,739 --> 00:36:39,764
which one happens by running the stats. AJ9K,
hit it! Inputting data, running calculations,

389
00:36:40,245 --> 00:36:46,942
processing results. Simulations complete. Yeah,
that was pretty gruesome for sure. I figured

390
00:36:46,962 --> 00:36:50,604
this would be pretty visceral because these
characters are pretty straightforward. You

391
00:36:50,624 --> 00:36:54,467
know, they're brawlers. Yeah, they're not going
to hold back either. The stats were pretty

392
00:36:54,487 --> 00:36:59,771
interesting. Blockbuster is faster than Tombstone,
even though Tombstone is pretty quick. Blockbuster,

393
00:36:59,991 --> 00:37:05,555
like you said, is like a rhino and can run really
fast. Blockbuster is also smarter than Tombstone.

394
00:37:05,996 --> 00:37:12,459
Yeah, at least the version I went with is...
The Mark version is super not smart, but the

395
00:37:12,499 --> 00:37:18,301
Roland version actually is very much so. We
did, however, give the edge to Tombstone in

396
00:37:18,342 --> 00:37:23,724
regards to durability, saying he's slightly
more durable than Blockbuster, but also in

397
00:37:23,764 --> 00:37:28,025
regards to versatility, which actually wasn't
too surprising to me, considering Tombstone

398
00:37:28,386 --> 00:37:33,147
will bring weapons into fights. Yeah. And he
also has his sharp teeth, which he used to

399
00:37:33,188 --> 00:37:38,730
like bite things off. Right. He's a biter. Right.
But also because of his weapons. we gave the

400
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:44,334
range edge to Tombstone as well. Yeah, otherwise,
these characters were pretty much identical.

401
00:37:44,494 --> 00:37:48,677
You know, they had the same evasiveness. We
said they're about the same strength level

402
00:37:48,877 --> 00:37:52,680
and had about the same fighting skill. So with
all that said, Jonathan, who do you think is

403
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:59,624
winning this match? I'm hoping it's Blockbuster,
although Instagram does not agree with me for

404
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:04,828
the first time in a long time. The Marvel character
is actually coming out ahead with Tombstone

405
00:38:04,868 --> 00:38:10,623
currently sitting at 51 percent. of the vote.
Well, I'm glad to see that our Marvel Instagram

406
00:38:10,643 --> 00:38:15,805
fans are starting to show up for these polls,
but that's still a little close guys. Like

407
00:38:16,105 --> 00:38:20,067
we really want to be dominating these polls.
So if you're a Marvel fan, be sure to follow

408
00:38:20,107 --> 00:38:24,289
us on Instagram and then vote whenever Jonathan
gets these polls up, you know, at the very

409
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:29,071
last minute on Sundays when we record. Okay,
that's fair. But let's get the final results

410
00:38:29,091 --> 00:38:35,633
of the match. AJ 9K, the results please. Hey,
you are, sir. Okay, the winner of the duel.

411
00:38:36,362 --> 00:38:46,046
between Blockbuster and Tombstone is... Tombstone!
Gosh dang it! It wasn't a total wipeout, I

412
00:38:46,066 --> 00:38:52,809
think the match was fairly close. Out of 1000
simulated battles, Tombstone won 592, whereas

413
00:38:52,849 --> 00:39:00,452
Blockbuster won 408. In the end, the determining
factors largely were range and durability considering

414
00:39:00,512 --> 00:39:08,765
Tombstone is rock hard. Ugh! What I just I'm
just gonna keep saying that now I don't like

415
00:39:08,845 --> 00:39:13,908
it And I don't like the results of this match
either. I gotta say well you could blame Miggy

416
00:39:13,928 --> 00:39:19,952
for that one. I think yeah, Miggy What are you
doing? You're a DC fan. Come on. I'll say that

417
00:39:20,012 --> 00:39:24,575
thematically It was a good pitch for a dual
matchup But yeah, the Marvel fans on the discord

418
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:30,379
should all thank Miggy for his contribution
to Marvel's win rate this week Miggy just stay

419
