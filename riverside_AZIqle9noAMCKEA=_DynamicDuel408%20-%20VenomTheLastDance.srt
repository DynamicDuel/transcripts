00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,957
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,822 --> 00:00:30,567
the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where
we review superhero films and debate the superiority

3
00:00:30,607 --> 00:00:36,412
between Marvel and DC by comparing their characters
in stat-based battle simulations. I'm Johnny

4
00:00:36,452 --> 00:00:42,177
DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous Joe.
And in this episode, we are reviewing the latest

5
00:00:42,277 --> 00:00:48,078
Marvel Sony film to hit theaters, Venom, The
Last Dance. Yeah, the franchise is part of

6
00:00:48,118 --> 00:00:52,461
the Sony Spider-Man universe, which has not
been great. I would say that the Venom franchise

7
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:57,044
is probably the best thing about it. But how
did the latest Venom movie stack up compared

8
00:00:57,084 --> 00:01:01,426
to the rest of the films? We'll find out later
on in this episode. Before that, we're going

9
00:01:01,446 --> 00:01:06,329
to break down the comic book movie news from
the past week, of which we've got two Marvel

34
00:03:17,582 --> 00:03:24,023
out of the way, quick to the No Prize! A No
Prize is an award Marvel used to give out to

35
00:03:24,043 --> 00:03:29,365
fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel No Prize,
is a digital award we post on Instagram for

36
00:03:29,385 --> 00:03:33,806
the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week, we

37
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:39,168
asked you guys, who do you think is the scariest
Marvel or DC character and why? And we asked

38
00:03:39,188 --> 00:03:42,769
that because Halloween is coming up in a couple
of days, and we got a lot of great answers

39
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:46,009
from you guys. Let's go ahead and run down our
honorable mentions as well as the No Prize

40
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:52,532
winner. Our first honorable mention goes to
Colby Hentges, who said, Hey, boys, Colby Hentges,

41
00:03:52,752 --> 00:03:58,875
the scariest character in Marvel or DC is Major
Force. He will murder your girl and put her

42
00:03:58,915 --> 00:04:05,397
in a refrigerator. I don't want none of that.
Yeah, Major Force is a evil version, I guess

43
00:04:05,417 --> 00:04:12,840
you could say, of the hero Captain Adam. He
is notorious for killing Kyle Rayner's girlfriend

44
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:20,304
and then stuffing her in his fridge. which was
just horrifying in the comics, completely unnecessarily

45
00:04:20,364 --> 00:04:25,767
violent. I could see where Major Force would
be very scary for that reason. Yeah, Kyle Rayner

46
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:29,349
is a Green Lantern, right? And I remember it
was horrifying in the comic books because Kyle

47
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:34,071
Rayner came home, not knowing where she was,
opening up the refrigerator and then finding

48
00:04:34,111 --> 00:04:39,414
her there, which is something out of a slasher
film, scary movie. That is absolutely horrifying.

49
00:04:39,434 --> 00:04:44,177
I remember my first exposure to that was in
the Green Lantern Fears Itself comic book,

50
00:04:46,114 --> 00:04:52,419
graphic novel and there was a painted rendition
of his girlfriend in the fridge. And I remember

51
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:55,802
just being like, what the fuck is this? Cause
I had no context and it just seemed horribly

52
00:04:55,842 --> 00:05:00,185
violent and scary to me. So yeah, I thought
this was a pretty good answer. Yeah, it's the

53
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:06,210
event that coined the term fridging that's known
in the comic world. Yeah, it has a negative

54
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:12,615
connotation where writers will use love interests
deaths, primarily as plot devices for the protagonists,

55
00:05:12,695 --> 00:05:16,642
you know, and not really treating them like
real characters. It's a shallow move to say

56
00:05:16,662 --> 00:05:21,587
the least, but in this instance here, it was
a particularly scary one. Great answer, Colby.

57
00:05:21,747 --> 00:05:28,773
Our next honorable mention goes to Cyrus Moore,
who said, Hey guys, Cyrus Moore here. And I

58
00:05:28,813 --> 00:05:36,379
think I'm going to butcher this last name, but
I think Victor Zaz, the Batman villain, is

59
00:05:36,499 --> 00:05:43,525
probably the scariest DC villain of all time.
I mean, serial killer who kills people that

60
00:05:43,585 --> 00:05:48,797
tallies. how many kills he has on his body,
just a real creepy character, creepy backstory.

61
00:05:49,518 --> 00:05:55,123
I think he's definitely the scariest. Yeah,
we've seen Victor Zazz appear in quite a few

62
00:05:55,263 --> 00:06:00,728
films outside of the comics. He was in Batman
Begins, he was in Birds of Prey, he was in

63
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:05,953
the Gotham television series. But yeah, the
dude's fairly creepy in that he's probably

64
00:06:06,273 --> 00:06:12,582
the least fantastical Batman villain in that
he's just a serial killer who... carves a tally

65
00:06:12,602 --> 00:06:17,784
mark into his skin for each kill that he's had
and his body is covered in tally marks. Yeah,

66
00:06:17,824 --> 00:06:22,826
I've seen versions of the character in the comics
where his tally marks are kind of sparse along

67
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:27,528
his body, but I've also seen renditions where
they like cover almost his entire body and

68
00:06:27,548 --> 00:06:31,770
they're across his forehead and his back and
everything like that and it just makes me wonder

69
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:36,172
like what does he do when he runs out of room?
I don't know. Just stretch that scrot.

70
00:06:41,602 --> 00:06:48,687
That's a horrifying visual. So yeah, a particularly
scary response to a scary question. Great answer,

71
00:06:48,747 --> 00:06:54,752
Cyrus. Our next honorable mention goes to Mason
Thompson, who said, I hate scary things. I'm

72
00:06:54,772 --> 00:06:59,977
gonna be straight up. I hate scary things. Why
do you wanna be scared of something? Tell me,

73
00:07:00,057 --> 00:07:05,201
why do you wanna be scared of something? We
could go off like auras and stuff, but like,

74
00:07:06,662 --> 00:07:15,092
if we're talking base looks, I'm going upside
down, man, from DC it oh I do not like it it's

75
00:07:15,112 --> 00:07:21,455
terrifying it's get out get out of my face so
yeah the upside down man was a villain that

76
00:07:21,616 --> 00:07:27,639
Wonder Woman's version of the Justice League
dark faced in the comics dude is super creepy

77
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:35,143
he's all white he has no face except for a mouth
like where his eyes should be it's a disturbing

78
00:07:35,264 --> 00:07:38,365
look you know it's almost like something out
of like stranger things or something like that

79
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:44,835
you know So yeah, a relatively new and obscure
character, but definitely creepy. To answer

80
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:49,616
Mason Thompson's question, the reason we like
to be scared, people who like horror films,

81
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:56,858
is because it gives you an adrenaline rush and
kind of amps you up mentally to, I think, better

82
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:01,640
prepare the horrors that are out there in the
real world. Like, if you watch, like, Paranormal

83
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,561
Activity, you will be prepared when you're walking
through your house at night and you hear a

84
00:08:06,581 --> 00:08:09,942
loud creak or something like that. You're gonna
be like, you know what? I've already mentally

85
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:14,545
gone through this, so I'm not afraid. Yeah,
you will be ready for that shit. Right, so

86
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:19,768
it just helps you to be brave. If you can handle
a fictional scenario that you're watching,

87
00:08:19,968 --> 00:08:24,851
you might just do better in the real world.
I think that's the appeal. That said, I also

88
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:29,454
hate scary things, and I refuse to watch them.
I love scary things. I watched a lot of great

89
00:08:29,494 --> 00:08:33,836
horror movies this Halloween season. And I also
feel like you have more nightmares than me.

90
00:08:33,956 --> 00:08:38,610
I don't though, because I'm not a wuss. Just
man up and watch it follows already, like I

91
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:43,513
told you to a thousand times. Hey, hey, I will
when I'm getting ready. I just don't wanna

92
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:46,854
be like recording down here in my basement,
then all of a sudden like, I turn around and

93
00:08:46,874 --> 00:08:51,356
there's like someone right there. That's why
I tell you, you have to watch it. No, I'm good.

94
00:08:51,376 --> 00:08:57,519
So you can be prepared for when that happens.
So great answer Mason Thompson. We wanna give

95
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:02,041
a quick shout out to Daniel Alonso and Michael
Williams for taking the time to visit our site

96
00:09:02,421 --> 00:09:06,026
and record your answers. We really appreciate
it. But the winner of this week's snow prize

97
00:09:06,186 --> 00:09:12,030
is Travis Herndon, who said, What's up dynamic
dudes? Travis here. Shout out to my evil twin.

98
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:17,733
So my answer had to be no. I mean, look at him.
He looks like if you get any from Iron Maiden

99
00:09:17,773 --> 00:09:22,035
and Freddy Cougar together, and this is their
love child. This dude is creepy. Yeah. You

100
00:09:22,055 --> 00:09:26,798
can say, well, venom is scary or carnage is
scary, but hey, we wouldn't have those two

101
00:09:26,818 --> 00:09:32,741
without this lanky ass creepy motherfucker.
I'd be more terrified of him than those two

102
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:37,707
any day of the week. What an appropriately timed
answer for this Venom the Last Dance review.

103
00:09:38,227 --> 00:09:44,208
Null, the eldritch god of darkness in the Marvel
Universe, is creepy as fuck. You know, he's

104
00:09:44,348 --> 00:09:50,110
all white, he has long white hair, black eyes,
except for the red spots, and his smile goes

105
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,852
all the way almost up to his ears, and a mouthful
of sharp teeth. Dude is intimidating not just

106
00:09:55,872 --> 00:10:01,073
because of how he looks though, but also because
of what he says and what he does. You know,

107
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:06,916
the guy has the feats. to back up his claims
and when he says like, you will drown in a

108
00:10:06,956 --> 00:10:11,880
sea of gnashing teeth and as your limbs are
ripped from your body, your blood will drench

109
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,382
the darkness or some shit like that. You know,
everything he says is like a lyric to a death

110
00:10:15,402 --> 00:10:21,787
metal song. I'm not too familiar with Null from
the comics, I'm not gonna lie. But spoiler

111
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:28,672
alert, we are doing a duel between him and the
White Lantern Kyle Rayner in our next episode.

112
00:10:28,732 --> 00:10:32,586
Yeah, that'll be a fun one. So stick around
for that next week. Great answer, Travis, you

113
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:36,909
win this week's No Prize if you the listener
want a shot at winning your own No Prize. Stay

114
00:10:36,949 --> 00:10:41,191
tuned to later on in this episode when we will
be asking another question of the week. And

115
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:51,398
now that that's done, onto the news! Alright,
this past week we got our first look at Spider-Man

116
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:57,461
Noir from the upcoming Amazon television series
titled Spider-Noir that's being produced by

117
00:10:57,601 --> 00:11:02,413
Sony. and it's starring Nicolas Cage and it
was quite the surprise when the show was announced.

118
00:11:02,433 --> 00:11:07,156
I thought it was really nice that they cast
the same actor who voiced the character in

119
00:11:07,236 --> 00:11:11,380
the Into the Spider-Verse film. I was really
looking forward to seeing how this was going

120
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,863
to turn out. I'll admit that I didn't have the
highest of expectations when it came to things

121
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:21,688
like the costume, but boy was I wrong because
the set photos that we got that were released

122
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:27,852
by TMZ look fantastic. The character design
is straight out of the Into the Spider-Verse

123
00:11:27,912 --> 00:11:32,935
movie in that he has the fedora because in the
comics he doesn't really wear the fedora, although

124
00:11:32,955 --> 00:11:36,458
I think they brought that on later on when they
saw how good it looked in the animated movie.

125
00:11:36,938 --> 00:11:41,901
But he's got the trench coat on here. We see
him like riding on top of a 1930s era car because

126
00:11:41,921 --> 00:11:45,924
the series is set during the Great Depression
and we even see him like shooting out his hand

127
00:11:45,964 --> 00:11:50,927
to fire a web and it all looks fantastic. It's
the stunt double on top of the car, most likely

128
00:11:51,027 --> 00:11:55,890
not Nicolas Cage, but things are shaping up
pretty well. for the Spider and War series.

129
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:00,511
Do we know that for sure? Cause I know Nicolas
Cage does a lot of his own stunt driving. Well,

130
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:05,753
he's not driving. He's standing on top of a
car. Same thing. No, I'm pretty sure it's a

131
00:12:05,813 --> 00:12:09,394
stunt double. The way he's crouched and everything
like that just make it more plausible that

132
00:12:09,434 --> 00:12:15,635
it's the stunt double. Though we have seen Nicolas
Cage in the costume sans his mask. And I thought

133
00:12:15,655 --> 00:12:19,597
he looked pretty cool. I mean, the costume is
very basic. It's all black with a black trench

134
00:12:19,617 --> 00:12:24,950
coat, but not gonna lie, that's still kind of
cool. Well, The costume is his Uncle Ben's

135
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:30,111
World War I Airman uniform. Oh, that's cool.
With a trench coat on top of that. So that's

136
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:35,213
pretty cool. As we discussed on this podcast
earlier, they did make some changes to the

137
00:12:35,253 --> 00:12:40,074
Spider-Man Noir story in that this is gonna
be Ben Reilly instead of Peter Parker, who

138
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,455
in the comic books is actually a clone of Peter
Parker, but I don't think he's gonna be a clone

139
00:12:43,515 --> 00:12:49,357
here. He's just named Ben Reilly in this particular
universe. Yeah, I'm guessing Kevin Feige from

140
00:12:49,657 --> 00:12:54,696
Marvel Studios made them do that. I'm actually
surprised to hear that this is on Amazon Prime.

141
00:12:54,876 --> 00:12:59,801
I thought it was going to be on Disney Plus.
No, Amazon Prime. Interesting. It's going to

142
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:03,524
be a crime show, although I believe it's also
going to have some supernatural elements to

143
00:13:03,544 --> 00:13:07,728
it. So if it's done like in the vein of something
like Batman, the doom that came to Gotham or

144
00:13:07,748 --> 00:13:12,532
something like that, I think that'd be pretty
cool. You wish. If it was only half as cool,

145
00:13:12,552 --> 00:13:17,236
you'd enjoy it. That's true. That's true. But
with this first look at his costume release,

146
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:21,534
I'm really looking forward to seeing what else
we get. from this series. We don't have a release

147
00:13:21,574 --> 00:13:26,536
date yet, I believe, but I'm already eagerly
anticipating it. Yeah, you have to imagine

148
00:13:26,576 --> 00:13:32,659
it's going to come out sometime next year. Yeah,
probably late next year or early 2026 is my

149
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:37,901
guess. Speaking of release dates though, we
got the really sucky news this past week that

150
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:43,744
Blade has been removed from its 2025 release
date that was set to be next November. It is

151
00:13:43,784 --> 00:13:47,365
sucky news, I guess it's not really surprising
news considering that if they wanted to make

152
00:13:47,405 --> 00:13:52,329
that release date, They would have already probably
started shooting and we definitely would have

153
00:13:52,349 --> 00:13:57,433
had a new director by this point, ever since
Yann Demange left the project. Now this doesn't

154
00:13:57,453 --> 00:14:02,237
mean that the movie is cancelled, it's just
been delayed. And Marvel has picked up like

155
00:14:02,297 --> 00:14:07,721
three new release dates going into 2028 I believe,
so it's entirely possible that they're just

156
00:14:07,742 --> 00:14:12,626
choosing to sit on the Blade movie until they
have you know, the right script and the right

157
00:14:12,646 --> 00:14:18,534
director for the project. I'm just wondering
why this keeps happening to this movie. I don't

158
00:14:18,554 --> 00:14:23,615
know. Is it really that hard to crack a good
Blade story? Because I feel like we've done

159
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:28,977
it at least three times already. You mean the
first three Blade movies? Yeah. I mean, I would

160
00:14:28,997 --> 00:14:33,818
not count Blade Trinity as a good Blade story.
They at least gotta make sure they do better

161
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:39,660
than that with this reboot. Yeah, but that film
had problems outside of just the story. And

162
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,221
I feel like the problem that this new movie
keeps running into is that they can't agree

163
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:50,361
on what the story is creatively. Yeah, maybe.
I mean, reports say that the previous scripts

164
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:55,705
that were submitted had Blade as not the main
character, and he was more of like a side character

165
00:14:55,745 --> 00:15:00,570
in his own film, which didn't make sense, so
something is not quite going right from the

166
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:06,094
conception phase, I think. But I am really excited
to see Mahershala Ali as the Blade character.

167
00:15:06,134 --> 00:15:10,142
I know that a lot of people are hoping that
Wesley Snipes comes back into the role. I think

168
00:15:10,182 --> 00:15:13,924
that's just wishful thinking. I think he's kind
of aged out of it by this point. And I thought

169
00:15:13,944 --> 00:15:18,547
they gave him a pretty decent sendoff in the
Deadpool and Wolverine film. There's only been

170
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:24,651
one Blade. There's only ever gonna be one Blade.
I really like Mahershala Ali as an actor. And

171
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:29,554
I just think he'd be fantastic in the role.
So here's hoping they kind of crack that story

172
00:15:30,034 --> 00:15:35,017
and this Blade movie could pick up a release
date in 2026 or 2027 or something like that.

173
00:15:35,262 --> 00:15:39,446
It's interesting that you're saying that he
was written into stories where he wasn't the

174
00:15:39,586 --> 00:15:45,431
main character, even though he's the title character
supposedly, because I'm seeing current rumors

175
00:15:45,552 --> 00:15:50,977
that they may just skip the Blade movie and
skip straight to a Midnight Suns film. Yeah,

176
00:15:50,997 --> 00:15:54,701
that's one of the rumors that's going around.
I really hope that's not the case. I think

177
00:15:54,761 --> 00:15:59,585
that would be an instance of Marvel pulling
a DC, which they definitely don't want to do.

178
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:03,960
And I say that because, you know, they threw
together the Justice League movie without giving

179
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:08,122
all the characters on the team their own films,
which I think was a mistake. They should do

180
00:16:08,162 --> 00:16:12,265
it the Marvel way, like they did with the Avengers,
where the characters had their own films leading

181
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:16,868
up to the movie. You know what they should do?
Just give each of the Midnight Sun characters

182
00:16:17,048 --> 00:16:22,291
their own special presentation, like holiday
type film. Just do that. Like you don't need

183
00:16:22,331 --> 00:16:26,713
to do a full feature length thing. Just do a
short and then have the Midnight Sun's movie.

184
00:16:27,242 --> 00:16:30,786
I wouldn't hate that. I mean, they gave a special
presentation to Werewolf by Night, which I

185
00:16:30,806 --> 00:16:35,151
thought was really solid. I had a lot of fun
with that one. So, I would not be unhappy with

186
00:16:35,171 --> 00:16:40,256
that. But as we mentioned earlier, like, Blade
fights vampires, right? Just make a movie about

187
00:16:40,316 --> 00:16:45,542
that. Make it interesting. It shouldn't be that
hard to figure this story out. And with that

188
00:16:45,582 --> 00:16:47,565
in mind, that brings us to our question of the

That does it for all of the news for this episode.
Now let's go ahead and move on to the main

198
00:17:40,122 --> 00:17:47,049
event where we review the latest Sony Spider-Man
universe film Venom, The Last Dance.

199
00:18:03,242 --> 00:18:08,205
Alright, Venom The Last Dance was written and
directed by Kelly Marcel and stars Tom Hardy,

200
00:18:08,645 --> 00:18:14,870
Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Juno Temple. Director
Kelly Marcel also wrote the first two installments

201
00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:20,214
of the Venom franchise and took over as director
for this latest go-round, which I kind of thought

202
00:18:20,234 --> 00:18:24,417
was interesting because I found it probably
the best directed installment of the bunch.

203
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah, it definitely felt like the most cohesive
in regards to both the direction and the writing.

204
00:18:30,441 --> 00:18:35,055
Yeah, it kind of felt- more like an MCU film
than the previous two installments did, right?

205
00:18:35,215 --> 00:18:38,797
Yeah, I can see that. I was kind of dreading
this movie, especially after the lackluster

206
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:43,239
film before this, Venom Let There Be Carnage,
which we gave two and a half stars. But with

207
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:49,642
Venom The Last Dance, I found myself not thrilled
with the movie, but satisfied in a way that

208
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:53,124
I wasn't with the last one, because I had some
fun with this film, kind of like the first

209
00:18:53,164 --> 00:18:57,799
movie. There's some cool action, some humor
that lands. and some good character beats.

210
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,042
So if you haven't seen Venom the Last Ants and
plan to, listen no further because this is

211
00:19:03,102 --> 00:19:07,726
a spoiler review. My biggest gripe with the
second film, Let There Be Carnage, was that

212
00:19:07,826 --> 00:19:13,670
Venom was reduced to a caricature of himself
and the movie leaned a little bit too far into

213
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:19,582
his goofy side as a means of subverting this
scary looking monster. And that really doesn't

214
00:19:19,602 --> 00:19:24,845
change here too much with this movie. We do
have, you know, Venom making margaritas, singing

215
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:30,528
to David Bowie, and dancing to ABBA. As fucking
ridiculous as that can be for fans of the comic

216
00:19:30,548 --> 00:19:36,510
book character, The Last Stance at least has
one thing going for it over Let There Be Carnage,

217
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:41,233
and that's that this third film actually has
good stakes. You know, there's an actual feeling

218
00:19:41,293 --> 00:19:46,925
of danger to the proceedings. And the movie
actually had balls to sacrifice the title character,

219
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:51,689
I think, in a way that felt meaningful. And
I can respect that. And I actually thought

220
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:57,474
that those stakes helped offset some of the
goofiness that we see here. Because, you know,

221
00:19:57,634 --> 00:20:02,979
this film had the potential to be pretty dark
otherwise. Yeah, it has pretty dark themes,

222
00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:07,222
right? There's oftentimes throughout the film
where Venom's kind of talking about how things

223
00:20:07,262 --> 00:20:12,030
would be better for Eddie, maybe, if the two
were separate. But... that you don't really

224
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:17,095
want to be separate. So then it kind of has
this ominous foreshadowing that kind of hangs

225
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:21,899
over the entire film, I would say. Yeah, and
in that sense, the humor and the jokes that

226
00:20:21,939 --> 00:20:27,064
were at play here actually had purpose, unlike
the second movie where the jokes were mainly

227
00:20:27,104 --> 00:20:32,209
just for shits and giggles. Because we all know
that Carnage wasn't nearly as menacing as he

228
00:20:32,249 --> 00:20:36,192
could and should have been. But things like,
you know, Venom's instant addiction to gambling,

229
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:41,095
the symbiote horse... Those things just worked
for me in this movie in a way that they didn't

230
00:20:41,315 --> 00:20:45,838
in the second film. I'll say that Venom 3 has
the greatest amount of spectacle too out of

231
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:50,460
all the films. All the action beats I thought
were on point including the fight in the dog

232
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:55,703
pit, the airplane fight, the river chase. That
fucking fight at the end of the movie at the

233
00:20:55,743 --> 00:21:01,906
Empyrean base at Area 51, holy shit man. Like
seeing all those multiple symbiotes. and how

234
00:21:01,946 --> 00:21:06,669
they each have their own fighting style going
up against some of the most impressive movie

235
00:21:06,709 --> 00:21:12,354
monsters I've seen in a long time, the Xenophages.
That shit was badass. Dude, I want to see a

236
00:21:12,434 --> 00:21:18,198
Xenophage go up against a Xenomorph Queen on
Max Destruction. The Kamacho twins have to

237
00:21:18,238 --> 00:21:23,102
do that battle. That would be pretty cool. I
mean, the Xenophages move pretty well though,

238
00:21:23,162 --> 00:21:27,545
like whether it's through the air with their
super leaping ability or running on the ground.

239
00:21:28,134 --> 00:21:34,338
and their fucking woodchipper heads, right?
When I saw them devour one of the Imperium

240
00:21:34,378 --> 00:21:37,881
soldiers and like basically all of his blood
and guts shot out the back of the creature's

241
00:21:37,901 --> 00:21:42,364
head, my jaw dropped. And I was like, what the
fuck did I just see? I've never seen anything

242
00:21:42,404 --> 00:21:48,429
like that in a monster movie. So just when you
think you've seen it all, Venom III has some

243
00:21:48,469 --> 00:21:53,372
surprises up its sleeve. Are the xenophages
from the comics? They are, yeah. They're not

244
00:21:53,392 --> 00:22:00,464
creations of null. but they are natural alien
predators of the symbiotes. Gotcha. Really

245
00:22:00,504 --> 00:22:05,166
what the xenophages should be, and fans of the
comic books will know this, they should have

246
00:22:05,186 --> 00:22:11,368
been symbiote dragons. Those are the eldritch
creatures that Null has created, and symbiote

247
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:15,570
dragons have the ability to kind of spew out
symbiotes of their own. And that would have

248
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:18,892
been cool to see here, but I can understand
why they went with the xenophages, because

249
00:22:18,932 --> 00:22:24,798
if you start introducing dragons into the Venom
franchise, then things kind of start feeling

250
00:22:24,838 --> 00:22:30,720
a little bit fantasy based and you want to keep
things kind of alien and monstrous. But it

251
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,221
would have been cool to see Grendel in this
movie, who is one of Null's first symbiote

252
00:22:35,241 --> 00:22:40,903
dragons that got trapped thousands of years
ago on Earth. Hmm. That shit went entirely

253
00:22:40,983 --> 00:22:45,864
over my head, but it sounds cool. And you have
to imagine that maybe we'll get to see that

254
00:22:45,884 --> 00:22:50,775
in future installments within Sony's Spider-Man
universe. Yeah, and I'm glad you brought that

255
00:22:50,815 --> 00:22:55,459
up because it is really hard to know what to
think about this movie at the end of it in

256
00:22:55,519 --> 00:23:00,343
regards to future installments for Sony's Spider-Man
universe. Now, this is supposed to be the last

257
00:23:00,483 --> 00:23:07,049
time we see Tom Hardy suited up as Venom and
as Eddie Brock. And yet the movie set up so

258
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:12,875
many cool threads that we're not sure will ever
be picked up in future installments. And you

259
00:23:12,915 --> 00:23:17,746
might even call them plot holes in this sense,
but things like Null. Things like the shadowy

260
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:23,307
organization behind Imperium. Things like that,
you know? What's gonna happen there? Is Sony's

261
00:23:23,347 --> 00:23:29,149
Spider-Man universe gonna continue or is it
going to falter? Who knows? Ideally, the best

262
00:23:29,189 --> 00:23:34,311
case scenario is that Spider-Man 4 involves
the character of Venom and they pick up a lot

263
00:23:34,351 --> 00:23:39,372
of these dangling threads. In that regard, I
hope the movie actually does really well at

264
00:23:39,392 --> 00:23:44,013
the box office, because it would be nice to
have that best case scenario happen, essentially.

265
00:23:44,502 --> 00:23:50,203
Yeah, I feel like a lot of people have been
speculating that Noah will be a part of Spider-Man

266
00:23:50,243 --> 00:23:55,365
4. And I think Marvel Studios has been hesitant
to confirm that. I think they're waiting to

267
00:23:55,425 --> 00:24:01,947
see how well this Venom movie does. So if you
do want to see Venom in Spider-Man 4, the more

268
00:24:01,967 --> 00:24:07,229
people that see this last Venom movie, the better.
Yeah, in theaters too. I think that would be

269
00:24:07,249 --> 00:24:10,578
best for everybody. Because, you know, it's
worth seeing on the big screen, I think. There

270
00:24:10,598 --> 00:24:14,559
are some pretty solid visual effects here. I
think the visual effects for the symbiotes

271
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:21,322
are better also than the previous two installments.
So I accidentally saw this movie in 3D, like

272
00:24:21,342 --> 00:24:26,783
I got my tickets and they're like, oh, here's
your 3D glasses. And I was like, what? Gosh,

273
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:32,005
dang it. And it was like the last showing of
the night. So I was like, whatever. But it

274
00:24:32,025 --> 00:24:36,447
wasn't terrible, actually. I could think off
the top of my head of some pretty cool scenes

275
00:24:36,467 --> 00:24:42,049
that I think would have been cool in 3D, like
the airplane scene. Yes. Like when Venom's

276
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:46,691
floating head is talking to Eddie, things like
that. There were definitely some shots that

277
00:24:46,731 --> 00:24:52,473
they did that I felt like were tailor made for
3D, where it's like, okay, yeah, that was totally

278
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:56,335
meant for me to like, trying to reach out and
touch it. And actually, my daughter who saw

279
00:24:56,355 --> 00:25:02,870
the film with me did exactly that. That's cool.
I bet you Lasher was really cool in 3D. with

280
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:08,572
her tentacles. Oh yeah, all of the symbiotes
were really cool in 3D. Nice. Now you mentioned

281
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:12,814
before that the plot threads might be plot holes.
I don't think that's the case. I definitely

282
00:25:12,834 --> 00:25:16,155
think they're plot threads that could be picked
up in another film so I don't fault them for

283
00:25:16,195 --> 00:25:23,818
that. That said, I do think this film has plot
holes such as how the hell did Venom know that

284
00:25:23,918 --> 00:25:29,140
Area 51 had this like acid shower bath thing?
That's a great question. He wouldn't have known.

285
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:35,711
Yeah. It made for a dramatic death scene though.
Like I felt really bad for Venom actually,

286
00:25:36,152 --> 00:25:40,935
you know, seeing this character that we've grown
to know and love over the course of three films

287
00:25:41,395 --> 00:25:46,078
die in such a horribly painful and tragic way.
I think it was hard for Eddie to watch, too.

288
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:52,042
And I guess some other things that aren't quite
plot holes, but are just kind of weird is like

289
00:25:52,423 --> 00:25:59,688
what was up with Dr. Payne's whole backstory
and, you know. Dude, I get into that. Okay.

290
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:04,394
That whole fucking thing was so bizarre. We'll
get there though in the character breakdown.

291
00:26:04,894 --> 00:26:09,015
Speaking of which, let's go ahead and do that
now. First, let's talk about Venom slash Eddie

292
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:14,817
Brock, played by Tom Hardy. You know, if this
is the last time we ever see Tom Hardy as the

293
00:26:14,857 --> 00:26:19,698
character of Eddie Brock, which I hope it's
not, I want to say that Tom Hardy's performance

294
00:26:19,718 --> 00:26:23,819
should go down as one of the most technically
brilliant physical performances ever committed

295
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:29,501
to the screen. Even if there's like some probably
speed ramping involved, I think his movements

296
00:26:29,661 --> 00:26:35,573
when Venom is in control make it actually seem
as if they're involuntary, as if he has strings

297
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:39,777
that are being pulled like a puppet. I think
a lot of people might wonder why such a gifted

298
00:26:39,817 --> 00:26:45,421
performance on par with Charlie Chaplin or Peter
Sellers would be wasted on a franchise as goofy

299
00:26:45,441 --> 00:26:51,367
as Venom. But you know what? I still respect
it. For my money, there was no other actor

300
00:26:51,387 --> 00:26:56,751
better suited to the role of Eddie Brock. So
again, let's just make sure that he either

301
00:26:56,811 --> 00:27:01,714
returns in Spider-Man 4 or maybe even in the
MCU. I do agree that it was a great physical

302
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:07,196
performance, but I had the same problem with
Tom Hardy's acting in this film as I have in

303
00:27:07,277 --> 00:27:12,259
previous Venom films, and that is he kind of
mumbles a lot. And also it's really hard to

304
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:17,141
understand his Venom voice in some instances.
I noticed that here too. Like I understood

305
00:27:17,201 --> 00:27:22,163
it, but then I was thinking, man, I hope other
people got that because that was kind of an

306
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:27,065
important plot point that Venom just stated
when he was giving like exposition regarding

307
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:31,786
the character of Null and the codex and things
like that. Yeah, I understood everything. For

308
00:27:31,806 --> 00:27:36,228
the most part, Venom was saying regarding exposition.
That said, as I'm sure we'll get into later,

309
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:41,050
the exposition in this film is kind of terrible.
I can see where you can make that point. The

310
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:46,292
dialogue was not great in this movie, especially
between Rex Strickland and Teddy Payne. Yeah.

311
00:27:46,312 --> 00:27:52,135
How they're like commenting, I'm like, oh, here
we are now in the Imperium headquarters beneath

312
00:27:52,255 --> 00:27:57,577
Area 51. You know, it's just, it's too obvious.
Right? It's like, what? What are you guys doing?

313
00:27:58,017 --> 00:28:02,805
Yeah. Is this your first time here? What's going
on? Yeah, like talk like normal people, right?

314
00:28:02,885 --> 00:28:09,149
Exactly. Story-wise, Eddie's prime motivation
was to go to New York, which really didn't

315
00:28:09,449 --> 00:28:13,772
work for me because he was going there because
he had dirt on a judge and wanted to blackmail

316
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:18,255
them into clearing his name. Like, how does
that remotely seem like a good idea? I will

317
00:28:18,275 --> 00:28:22,598
grant him that the character was drunk when
he had the idea, but still, like, blackmailing

318
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:25,961
a judge, you know, committing a crime doesn't
seem like a great way to exonerate yourself

319
00:28:26,021 --> 00:28:30,684
of other crimes. It just seems like a good way
to rack up more charges, honestly. And honestly,

320
00:28:30,744 --> 00:28:35,207
like if you're going to do something like that,
wouldn't it be simpler just to, you know, threaten

321
00:28:35,227 --> 00:28:40,671
the prosecuting attorney or like the case judge
or something like that? Yeah, I guess that's

322
00:28:40,851 --> 00:28:45,935
true. I'll say that there were some great character
moments for Eddie. I was genuinely moved in

323
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:52,559
the camper scene with the Moon family when Venom
was commenting on how it would have been nice

324
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:57,214
to have a family and how Eddie would have made
a great dad. Those scenes with the kid were

325
00:28:57,475 --> 00:29:02,297
a great and kind of tragic peek into what could
have been for Eddie Brock. And of course, you

326
00:29:02,317 --> 00:29:07,140
know, the sacrifice at the end was also really
touching as Eddie sees this creature that he

327
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:12,844
didn't always get along with but had over time
really connected to die in this really painful

328
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:19,327
way. And like seeing Eddie remember his and
Venom's moments together across the franchise

329
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:24,419
was also a nice touch as he was at the Statue
of Liberty. I choked up a bit. Yeah, no kidding.

330
00:29:24,459 --> 00:29:30,126
There was a kid who was straight up balling
in my theater at the end of this movie. Oh,

331
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:35,673
dang. He was crying from the time Venom was
killing himself all the way to when Eddie was

332
00:29:35,793 --> 00:29:40,940
looking at the Statue of Liberty. I was like,
calm down, kid. Poor kid. Not only is this

333
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:47,006
a movie, he was an alien. You know, like as
much as you don't want to see Venom and Eddie

334
00:29:47,426 --> 00:29:53,228
be separated, I think the movie did do a nice
job of signaling that it was time. You know,

335
00:29:53,828 --> 00:29:58,629
Eddie looked worn, he looked tired, he definitely
signaled that he was dealing with a lot like

336
00:29:58,649 --> 00:30:03,051
when he killed the Imperium soldier in the river.
It kind of made the loss of Venom a little

337
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:07,412
bit more acceptable, I think, just because it
kind of felt like it was that time. But you

338
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:12,053
know, I expect we'll see Venom back before long,
hopefully. Let's go ahead and move on to Commander

339
00:30:12,153 --> 00:30:19,741
Rex Strickland. who was played by Chiwetel Eziofor.
Eziofor is a better actor than what the script

340
00:30:19,901 --> 00:30:26,005
gave him. There wasn't nearly enough for him
to do for an actor of his caliber. And I kind

341
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:31,008
of feel bad that he just came across as kind
of a generic angry military guy. I kind of

342
00:30:31,028 --> 00:30:35,911
felt like this was a paycheck for a number of
actors who appeared in the film. That said,

343
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:41,642
they didn't do a bad job. They made the most
somewhat of what was on the page. It just felt

344
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:46,527
like, why are you in this movie? Why are you
even accepting these lines? You're better than

345
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:51,872
this. It's really strange, though, particularly
what she would tell Ejio for because his character,

346
00:30:51,952 --> 00:30:56,897
Rex Strickland, is actually kind of a major
character in the King of Black storyline. In

347
00:30:56,917 --> 00:31:03,023
the comics, Rex Strickland was a soldier in
Vietnam who was given an ancient symbiote found

348
00:31:03,063 --> 00:31:08,066
on Earth by S.H.I.E.L.D. in order to become
a super soldier. and he helped Eddie out when

349
00:31:08,146 --> 00:31:12,468
his mind was stuck in the symbiote hive mind
in the King and Black story arc. And I kept

350
00:31:12,508 --> 00:31:17,210
thinking that at some point, Rex was going to
bond with the symbiote and we were going to

351
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:22,052
get to see the Tyrannosaurus symbiote, but that
just never happened. Like at the end fight

352
00:31:22,092 --> 00:31:27,394
scene against the xenophages, a symbiote should
have bonded with Rex. And I was kind of really

353
00:31:27,434 --> 00:31:31,736
confused when that didn't happen. It makes me
wonder why they bothered making this military

354
00:31:31,776 --> 00:31:36,442
guy, Rex Strickland, to begin with. You know,
he should have been. General Orwell Taylor,

355
00:31:36,482 --> 00:31:41,925
who we theorized his character was from the
trailers. Yeah, who knows? Maybe in earlier

356
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:46,487
drafts of the script, he was that character,
but for some reason they decided to go with

357
00:31:46,708 --> 00:31:52,010
Dr. Payne as the symbiote. And Dr. Payne's not
even a fucking character from the comic books.

358
00:31:52,171 --> 00:31:56,493
There's a Thaddeus Payne who was like a villain
that went up against a venom whose power was

359
00:31:56,513 --> 00:32:01,656
that he couldn't feel pain, but he never bonded
with a symbiote or anything. It's weird. Speaking

360
00:32:01,776 --> 00:32:02,376
of Dr.

361
00:32:05,894 --> 00:32:11,498
This character will go down in history as having
the worst flashback in cinematic history. I'm

362
00:32:11,518 --> 00:32:16,082
not even sure why that whole scene with her
brother on the beach and the lightning storm

363
00:32:16,122 --> 00:32:21,266
was even necessary considering it had no reason
to be in this movie. No, you're right. Like,

364
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:25,490
they tried to develop her character way more
than what was necessary considering the role

365
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:29,233
that she had to play in the plot. You know,
I think that screen time actually would have

366
00:32:29,253 --> 00:32:34,697
been better spent on an actual character from
the comics like Rex Strickland instead of Dr.

367
00:32:34,717 --> 00:32:40,484
Payne. And like really she had less to do than
her associate, Dr. Sadie Christmas, who was

368
00:32:40,564 --> 00:32:46,307
also an original character. What? She was original
too? What the hell is going on? I don't know.

369
00:32:46,767 --> 00:32:51,309
I have no idea. But it was weird that they both
got symbiotes, but Rex Strickland did not.

370
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:57,552
So backwards. You kind of just degraded this
film for me a little bit, because that sounds

371
00:32:57,592 --> 00:33:03,035
really dumb. Yeah, it is dumb. But I think what
kind of elevates the film back up a half a

372
00:33:03,055 --> 00:33:08,877
star is just seeing how cool Lasher and Agony
were in the movie. Lasher being the green symbiote

373
00:33:08,977 --> 00:33:14,480
that Sadie Christmas had and Agony being the
purple long-haired symbiote that Dr. Payne

374
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,721
got. Well, at least they're the symbiotes characters
from the comics. Yes. Yeah, I'm pretty sure

375
00:33:18,761 --> 00:33:24,624
the orange one was Phage. And we already saw
Riot in the first movie. He was the main antagonist

376
00:33:24,684 --> 00:33:29,450
of the first film. So we saw all the life foundation
symbiotes between the two films. But there

377
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:35,371
were even more symbiotes in this movie, like
the fire guy, the blue snake looking one. Those

378
00:33:35,411 --> 00:33:39,052
were all original and they were pretty cool.
What was the name of that guy in the cell?

379
00:33:39,532 --> 00:33:44,754
Detective Patrick Mulligan. What was his symbiote?
I don't know the name of his symbiote. In the

380
00:33:44,794 --> 00:33:50,415
comic books, Detective Patrick Mulligan is the
wielder of the Toxin symbiote, who is the offspring

381
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:56,737
of Carnage. Now, we thought that in this movie
we'd get to see Toxin, but that definitely

382
00:33:56,777 --> 00:34:01,743
was not Toxin in the container. And there's
a line in the movie about how Patrick Mulligan

383
00:34:01,783 --> 00:34:06,685
survived the events of the Carnage movie because
he had bonded with a symbiote, but that it

384
00:34:06,745 --> 00:34:13,108
had left his body and evaded Rex Strickland's
forces. So Toxin, the symbiote, is still out

385
00:34:13,128 --> 00:34:18,750
there somewhere around San Francisco, but they
bonded a new symbiote to Patrick Mulligan in

386
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:23,112
this movie. The blue one that I don't know the
name of. Well, that's stupid because apparently

387
00:34:23,432 --> 00:34:28,623
symbiotes could graft to fucking anybody. Yeah,
that's a thing that is not in keeping with

388
00:34:28,643 --> 00:34:33,207
the first film, because in the first film, the
Life Foundation found that the symbiote had

389
00:34:33,227 --> 00:34:37,550
to be like a proper match to the host, kind
of like an organ donor type situation. Otherwise,

390
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:42,313
the test subject would get really sick and then
die. But here, the symbiotes were just crafting

391
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:46,316
on to all kinds of scientists and soldiers,
and it seemed like they were doing just fine.

392
00:34:46,776 --> 00:34:50,599
And animals, which actually, I thought that
was kind of cool. That was really cool. I liked

393
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:55,511
the symbiote horse. I liked the symbiote fish.
That was really cool. and the frog was pretty

394
00:34:55,531 --> 00:34:59,114
interesting. And all the different cool animals
we got to see in the end credits. I know that's

395
00:34:59,154 --> 00:35:03,598
not like in the story, but it was just also
really cool to see visually. Yeah, yeah. Let's

396
00:35:03,618 --> 00:35:08,762
go ahead and move on to Martin Moon, who is
played by Reese Ifans. Going into the movie,

397
00:35:08,902 --> 00:35:12,406
I thought it was going to be really hard to
get over the idea of Reese Ifans playing the

398
00:35:12,426 --> 00:35:16,709
character because he's also, you know, Kurt
Connors the lizard from the Amazing Spider-Man

399
00:35:16,729 --> 00:35:21,213
franchise. And we saw him recently in the No
Way Home film, you know, and seeing him here.

400
00:35:21,642 --> 00:35:26,643
just cemented the idea of the Venom films taking
place outside of the Spider-Man universe and

401
00:35:26,663 --> 00:35:32,545
it's just something you hate to see, you know?
And I'm not 100% sure Martin Moon was entirely

402
00:35:32,585 --> 00:35:37,106
necessary to the plot in this film, but I will
say that over time he grew on me and I did

403
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:41,827
begin to appreciate his appearance because it
offered a chance for some solid character development

404
00:35:41,887 --> 00:35:47,509
for Eddie, you know? Like Martin Moon was almost
like his spirit guide on his journey and he

405
00:35:47,569 --> 00:35:53,624
kind of reminded the audience of... the humanity
basically that was at stake in this film. Sure.

406
00:35:53,664 --> 00:35:58,626
Yeah. Kind of brought some like real life stakes
to the final battle. And that here was this

407
00:35:58,706 --> 00:36:03,009
ordinary family that, you know, could be killed.
Yeah. The family kind of ramped up the danger

408
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:07,391
and ramped up the levity to the proceedings,
I think. There were some funny moments with

409
00:36:07,411 --> 00:36:12,334
the family. Yeah, definitely some funny moments.
But like you, I also am not 100 percent sure

410
00:36:12,374 --> 00:36:17,737
they were even needed in this film. I would
have much rather seen more backstory regarding

411
00:36:17,837 --> 00:36:23,573
Noel. Or at least see Null in action in some
way. I don't know. Yeah, I think the best way

412
00:36:23,613 --> 00:36:28,175
to see Null in action would have been through
flashback, kind of seeing him take on the Celestials

413
00:36:28,215 --> 00:36:33,739
or something like that before his eventual imprisonment
by the Klyntar alien race. Yeah, I wanted to

414
00:36:33,759 --> 00:36:38,581
see more of that for sure, because it was kind
of confusing in that I knew he was like the

415
00:36:38,621 --> 00:36:44,685
main bad guy of the film. And yet, by the end,
we didn't get to see him fight Venom. That

416
00:36:44,725 --> 00:36:49,142
surprised me. Yeah, it was kind of like the
primary antagonist of the film was really the

417
00:36:49,202 --> 00:36:54,788
Xenophage. They also had Rex Strickland, but
he's not nearly as cool as Null, I'll say that.

418
00:36:54,808 --> 00:36:59,954
No, yeah, you're right. Speaking of Null, he
was played by Andy Serkis. I thought the design

419
00:36:59,994 --> 00:37:04,419
was straight out of the comic books. I thought
they gave him a really great setup. It's unfortunate

420
00:37:04,459 --> 00:37:09,211
there was no payoff and So you just have to
hope that we'll see him again sometime in the

421
00:37:09,231 --> 00:37:12,593
future and that they're just really playing
the long game, which they should do. You know,

422
00:37:12,693 --> 00:37:16,715
Null should not be a one and done villain. You
know, he's kind of like Thanos. We should really

423
00:37:16,775 --> 00:37:22,058
see him spread out over the course of multiple
films as a major threat. Yeah, if Kevin Feige

424
00:37:22,098 --> 00:37:28,501
doesn't hop on this setup that Sony gave him,
then that is a huge shame. I don't think Sony

425
00:37:28,521 --> 00:37:32,484
would let him. I think they're planning their
own thing with their own Spider-Man universe.

426
00:37:32,744 --> 00:37:37,468
Well, then I don't care anymore because that's
just stupid. Do I really want to see Madame

427
00:37:37,508 --> 00:37:47,526
Webb go up against Null? No. Morbius? No. Craven?
Absolutely not. I'd watch it. Shut up. Let's

437
00:38:43,646 --> 00:38:48,087
The movie starts as we see Null, the eldritch
god of darkness and creator of the symbiotes,

438
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:53,989
imprisoned on Klintar by the beings he created.
Looking for the codex key that will free him,

439
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:59,511
he creates the xenophages, symbiote hunters,
and sends them out into the cosmos to find

440
00:38:59,551 --> 00:39:06,613
the codex. So right when I heard the word codex
I was like, oh, okay, like Man of Steel, gotcha.

441
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:12,980
No, this is entirely different. The Codex is
actually from the King and Black storyline,

442
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:20,003
except there the Codex was this basically Matrix
hive mind that the Klyntar alien race shared

443
00:39:20,283 --> 00:39:26,125
and Eddie Brock got lost in it. But here they
kind of reworked the Codex so that it's an

444
00:39:26,265 --> 00:39:32,028
actual key that forms when Asymbo resurrects
its host. And what did you think of that? That

445
00:39:32,068 --> 00:39:36,670
change that they made? I think it worked for
the story that they were telling here. I did

446
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:42,914
like how the codex was represented by that red
spiral, which is basically the symbol of Null,

447
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:47,778
and it shows up on the faces of the symbiotes
that he is in control of. So that was kind

448
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:53,862
of like a nice Easter egg. In Mexico, Eddie
Brock and Venom learn about the MCU 616 universe

449
00:39:53,902 --> 00:39:59,366
before being pulled back into their home dimension
to a similar bar. There they learn from TV

450
00:39:59,406 --> 00:40:03,349
news that Eddie is wanted for the alleged murder
of Detective Patrick Mulligan from the last

451
00:40:03,369 --> 00:40:07,839
movie. and Eddie decides they should get to
New York to blackmail a judge into giving them

452
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:13,162
amnesty. They leave the bar and stumble upon
a dog fighting pit where they fight and devour

453
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:19,084
the dog fighters. Venom and Eddie are caught
in Mexico on camera alerting Imperium, a government

454
00:40:19,144 --> 00:40:24,487
operation working out of a secret base below
Area 51. The cocktail scene was pretty funny

455
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:30,289
with Venom singing tequila as he's making Eddie
a margarita. I thought that was pretty funny.

456
00:40:30,954 --> 00:40:36,576
But it just made me think as Eddie got transported
to his home dimension bar that the Sony Venom

457
00:40:36,736 --> 00:40:42,118
universes seems like a slightly more sucky version
of other Marvel universes. Like this universe's

458
00:40:42,138 --> 00:40:46,741
version of the bartender is just like a down
and out version of the MCUs. This universe's

459
00:40:46,781 --> 00:40:52,683
version of Baron Mordo is just an army guy named
Rex. This universe's version of Kurt Connors,

460
00:40:52,703 --> 00:40:56,425
the Lizard, is just some dirty hippie named
Martin. Like everything's kind of similar,

461
00:40:56,505 --> 00:41:02,336
but vaguely more shitty. Well, Kurt Connors
wasn't even the MCU version in the No Way Home

462
00:41:02,396 --> 00:41:09,221
film. Technically, he was from a different universe.
But we've never seen the MCU's version of Kurt

463
00:41:09,241 --> 00:41:14,284
Connors. He may be played by re-siphons still.
I don't know. Who knows? That's true. That's

464
00:41:14,324 --> 00:41:19,048
fair. But you're right. Yeah, I guess this is
like the suckiest Marvel universe ever. It

465
00:41:19,068 --> 00:41:23,891
just kind of killed me how much they dropped
the ball on Eddie Brock's whole cameo appearance

466
00:41:24,051 --> 00:41:31,628
in No Way Home. Like that didn't amount to squat.
No, it didn't. It was basically just that,

467
00:41:31,708 --> 00:41:38,993
a cameo. Superlinks. With no real major implications,
except that Venom did shed in the MCU. He did

468
00:41:39,033 --> 00:41:43,276
leave like a shedded piece of himself, just
like he did in this movie. A shedded piece?

469
00:41:43,897 --> 00:41:48,780
Shedded piece. Oh, okay. What did you think
of the dogfight scene? That was cool. I actually

470
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,443
really liked that scene. I thought it was a
great opening action scene for the movie. I

471
00:41:53,463 --> 00:42:00,745
left my ass off when Eddie Brock threw his slipper.
at one of the bad guys. The croc? Yeah. Like

472
00:42:00,765 --> 00:42:04,508
a chancla. And he spent basically the whole
movie looking for another pair of shoes because

473
00:42:05,008 --> 00:42:09,652
he kept losing them. Imperium's commander Rex
Strickland visits the Mexico bar to obtain

474
00:42:09,692 --> 00:42:14,936
a venom sample left there and detain the bartender
for questioning. They're brought to Area 51

475
00:42:14,956 --> 00:42:17,418
which is being decommissioned where Commander
Strickland and

476
00:42:21,922 --> 00:42:26,204
who is being held at the Imperium facility due
to his life being saved via bonding with a

477
00:42:26,264 --> 00:42:30,807
symbiote. Mulligan's symbiote, which had arrived
on Earth with a handful of others on a meteor

478
00:42:30,827 --> 00:42:35,650
that crashed at Area 51 and was being studied
there, explains to Commander Strickland and

479
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:40,813
Dr. Payne that they came to Earth looking for
a safe haven while fleeing their creator Null

480
00:42:41,053 --> 00:42:47,337
and his xenophage hunters. I do have to ask,
why did they need to take the bartender? For

481
00:42:47,377 --> 00:42:52,509
questioning. They wanted to learn more about
where Venom might be going. And yeah, so they're

482
00:42:52,689 --> 00:42:56,232
going to interrogate him. Do you really think
he was worth an after credit scene? Because

483
00:42:56,853 --> 00:43:01,777
I can't believe I stayed for that. I think he
was brought in for the after credit scene as

484
00:43:01,817 --> 00:43:07,641
a reminder to the audience that while Venom
was at the bar, he did leave a shedded piece

485
00:43:07,681 --> 00:43:13,246
of himself. And I think that's what their insinuating
head bonded with the cockroach that was there

486
00:43:13,746 --> 00:43:19,270
and then interacted with the vial containing
the agony symbiote. Like the spark from that

487
00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:25,772
container, I think, kind of signified a sort
of like CPR effect on that Venom sample. So

488
00:43:25,792 --> 00:43:31,273
you're saying that there's a way for Eddie to
get Venom back. Correct. OK, I did not make

489
00:43:31,293 --> 00:43:35,854
that connection. In that case, I guess that
was an important scene. What did you think

490
00:43:35,874 --> 00:43:42,336
was the point of that whole after credit scene?
I have no clue, dude. I had no clue. All right.

491
00:43:42,376 --> 00:43:46,077
Meanwhile, Eddie and Venom hitch a ride on the
outside of a commercial airplane flying to

492
00:43:46,117 --> 00:43:50,867
New York. but they're discovered by a xenophage
who attacks them and forces the pair to leap

493
00:43:50,927 --> 00:43:55,850
off the plane, landing in the Mojave Desert.
There, Venom explains that when a symbiote

494
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:00,072
resurrects its host, like what Venom did to
Eddie during their fight against Riot, that

495
00:44:00,092 --> 00:44:04,834
a codex is formed that is the key to unlocking
Gnull from his prison. Venom states that the

496
00:44:04,894 --> 00:44:09,457
xenophage can track that codex when the symbiote
takes over the host, and therefore Venom has

497
00:44:09,477 --> 00:44:14,475
to avoid taking over Eddie. He instead takes
over a horse to get him and Eddie across the

498
00:44:14,516 --> 00:44:19,499
desert. Regarding the codex, it makes you think
that a symbiote would avoid ever resurrecting

499
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:24,382
its host because it knows the consequences would
be forming the codex. But I think that just

500
00:44:24,402 --> 00:44:29,085
speaks to Venom and Eddie's relationship and
that Venom actually cared enough about Eddie

501
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:35,209
to resurrect him and risk the formation of that
codex. Right, right. Reports of the airplane

502
00:44:35,229 --> 00:44:39,232
attack reach Imperium and Commander Strickland
sends a squad out to the desert where they

503
00:44:39,272 --> 00:44:43,583
find and chase Venom and Eddie through a river.
The fight forces Venom to take over Eddie,

504
00:44:43,683 --> 00:44:48,225
which draws in the Xenophage, who makes short
work of the Imperium forces, letting Eddie

505
00:44:48,245 --> 00:44:53,608
and Venom escape. Back at Area 51, Mulligan's
symbiote explains that unless either Venom

506
00:44:53,648 --> 00:44:59,732
or Eddie die and the Codex is broken, the Xenophage
will obtain the Codex and release Null, leading

507
00:44:59,772 --> 00:45:04,895
to the death of all living beings in the universe.
Fantastic stakes, as I've mentioned before.

508
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:10,510
I'm really wondering that if Null actually does
get released in a future Sony Spider-Man Universe

509
00:45:10,530 --> 00:45:16,253
movie how these characters would ever stand
a chance against him because the guy is basically

510
00:45:16,294 --> 00:45:21,637
all powerful. You know Morbius ain't gonna do
shit against him. Neither is Madame Web or

511
00:45:21,717 --> 00:45:26,920
Spider-Man or Venom or all of them teamed up
for that matter. Cravin. Back to the movie

512
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:31,623
Eddie and Venom stumble upon Martin Moon, an
alien enthusiast and his family who are on

513
00:45:31,663 --> 00:45:37,119
their way to visit Area 51 before it's fully
decommissioned. hopes to see an extraterrestrial,

514
00:45:37,279 --> 00:45:41,881
and they offer to give Eddie a ride to Las Vegas
in their camper. Arriving at the Paris Casino,

515
00:45:42,301 --> 00:45:47,984
Eddie and Venom run into Ms. Chen, who has struck
it rich gambling. She and Venom share a dance,

516
00:45:48,465 --> 00:45:53,247
but they're ambushed by Imperium's forces who
located Eddie and Venom's location via security

517
00:45:53,267 --> 00:45:59,731
cameras. They separate Venom and Eddie, bringing
them to the Area 51 base. I thought the gambling

518
00:45:59,751 --> 00:46:06,006
scene was pretty funny. If you've ever played
a slot machine, you'll know but it is really

519
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:11,109
fun to pull that lever in a way that is probably
unhealthy. Well, nowadays, all you have to

520
00:46:11,129 --> 00:46:14,611
do is push a button. You don't even need to
pull the lever. But why would you? I like to

521
00:46:14,631 --> 00:46:18,774
pull the lever though. Best part. What did you
think of the dancing scene? On one hand, you

522
00:46:18,854 --> 00:46:24,577
really hate to see a character like Venom dance
to ABBA. On the other hand, it was kind of

523
00:46:24,617 --> 00:46:28,740
funny. It was more funny than I thought it would
be, especially when Eddie was like, what did

524
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:36,003
you guys have time to rehearse this? That was
great. Yeah, but it does make me wonder, like,

525
00:46:36,443 --> 00:46:41,264
was Mrs. Chen reintroduced in this film just
so they could have this dance scene? I think

526
00:46:41,324 --> 00:46:45,845
Miss Chen was a popular enough character from
the previous two films. I mean, she even showed

527
00:46:45,885 --> 00:46:50,607
up in the Spider-Verse movie, speaking to the
spot. So I think she's just kind of become

528
00:46:50,627 --> 00:46:54,648
a staple of the franchise. And I think she'd
be sorely missed if she wasn't in one of these

529
00:46:54,688 --> 00:46:59,069
films. Well, that's right. I forgot the character
was in that movie. Yeah, I guess she is a staple

530
00:46:59,109 --> 00:47:06,508
now. I guess we'll see her in Craven next. At
the Imperium base, Eddie meets Mulligan's symbiote

531
00:47:06,568 --> 00:47:11,811
who tells him to free Imperium's captured symbiotes.
Commander Strickland shoots Eddie in an attempt

532
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:16,674
to destroy the Codex, however Imperium scientist
Sadie Christmas, who had bonded with Venom

533
00:47:16,714 --> 00:47:22,037
in order to save him, delivers Venom back to
Eddie. Venom and Eddie's reunion alerts the

534
00:47:22,097 --> 00:47:27,440
Xenophage to their location, who attacks the
Imperium base forcing several of their soldiers

535
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:32,838
and scientists to bond with the captured symbiotes.
who unite to attack the creature. Eddie and

536
00:47:32,878 --> 00:47:38,600
Venom try to flee as the xenophage sends a signal
to Null to send more creatures and the symbiotes

537
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:43,741
are overpowered. Who was your favorite symbiote
out of the group? Still Venom. I liked the

538
00:47:43,801 --> 00:47:48,203
orange rocky looking one. I also liked the fire
one, although I don't really think that makes

539
00:47:48,263 --> 00:47:53,564
sense. You could say that purified symbiotes
no longer have the weakness to sonics and fire,

540
00:47:53,864 --> 00:47:59,506
but it just doesn't ring true, I think, to have
a symbiote with lava powers. That being said,

541
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:05,249
it was a cool visual, especially when the Xenophage
ate the Assymbia and shot flames from the back

542
00:48:05,269 --> 00:48:12,313
of its head. That's a spicy meatball. I am really
confused as to why Dr. Christmas bonded with

543
00:48:12,393 --> 00:48:17,455
Venom. You said it was to save Eddie, but she
didn't know that was going to happen. And why

544
00:48:17,475 --> 00:48:21,397
would she want to save Eddie considering the
fact that she knew the stakes if they were

545
00:48:21,417 --> 00:48:27,725
to re-bond? I think she knew that either Venom
or Eddie was going to die there and she felt

546
00:48:27,805 --> 00:48:32,429
bad about it. It almost seems to me like she
was just trying to straight up steal a symbiote.

547
00:48:32,929 --> 00:48:36,832
I don't think so considering she gave it to
Eddie Brock right away. It was interesting

548
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:40,975
how some of the symbiotes were like elemental,
that you had, you know, your rocky symbiote,

549
00:48:41,295 --> 00:48:47,479
your fiery symbiote, your electrical symbiote.
Right, vine symbiote. Yeah, which is not really

550
00:48:47,499 --> 00:48:51,122
something from the comic books, but I actually
really like that as a concept. Venom would

551
00:48:51,142 --> 00:48:58,365
just be like the dark ink symbiote, oil symbiote.
Yeah. Is it just me or are the moon parents

552
00:48:58,505 --> 00:49:03,767
the worst parents in the history of parenting?
And I feel like there are real parents like

553
00:49:03,787 --> 00:49:08,909
that too, which is wild. Let's sneak onto this
military base where we could potentially, you

554
00:49:08,929 --> 00:49:14,411
know, get shot and bring our kids with us who
can also, you know, get shot. There's no aliens

555
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:20,798
here kids. That's unfortunate because I really
wanted us to be attacked by aliens. Venom and

556
00:49:20,838 --> 00:49:25,759
Eddie realize that one of them has to die in
order to stop the xenophages. Eddie accepts

557
00:49:25,779 --> 00:49:31,140
his fate, but Venom separates himself to assimilate
the xenophages and protect Eddie. Venom brings

558
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:35,462
the creatures to acid tanks used for destroying
Area 51's equipment, and Commander Strickland

559
00:49:35,522 --> 00:49:41,023
melts Venom and the creatures before destroying
them and himself with a grenade. Eddie falls

560
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:45,844
unconscious before waking up in a military hospital
alone, where he learns that he's been pardoned

561
00:49:45,904 --> 00:49:51,494
of all charges as long as he keeps quiet about
Area 51 and the and he travels to New York

562
00:49:51,534 --> 00:49:57,359
City where he visits the Statue of Liberty while
remembering venom. Um, how powerful was the

563
00:49:57,399 --> 00:50:02,984
grenade that Commander Strickland used? Because
holy shit, not only did that destroy himself

564
00:50:03,184 --> 00:50:08,308
and Venom and the Xenophages, but it was also
like a massive ass almost nuclear explosion

565
00:50:08,328 --> 00:50:13,933
that rained down fire across a massive radius.
From one grenade, like was the acid combustible

566
00:50:13,993 --> 00:50:19,557
or something? That's what I was thinking, like
it was flammable acid somehow. I have no idea.

567
00:50:20,098 --> 00:50:26,860
There's gasoline in that acid, right? The whole
acid thing just throws me like right when I

568
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,982
saw that scene, I was like, OK, that's going
to be used somehow later. I'm pretty sure.

569
00:50:31,462 --> 00:50:37,385
But like, why were they dissolving things with
fucking acid? Makes no sense to me. That's

570
00:50:37,405 --> 00:50:41,566
a great question. I don't have the answer for
you. It doesn't make sense. But it was kind

571
00:50:41,586 --> 00:50:47,549
of a cinematic way for venom to go out, you
know. Sure. Did you think that Eddie was going

572
00:50:47,569 --> 00:50:53,665
to die when he was in the helicopter? just kind
of like bleeding out. I wasn't sure which one

573
00:50:53,706 --> 00:50:57,729
of them was gonna die, but when Venom healed
Eddie at that point, I realized that Venom

574
00:50:57,769 --> 00:51:02,594
was gonna be the one to sacrifice himself. In
a mid-credits scene, Null threatens the universe,

575
00:51:03,134 --> 00:51:07,979
and in an after credits scene, we see the Mexican
bartender leave the destroyed Imperium base,

576
00:51:08,119 --> 00:51:12,863
along with a Venom symbiote-infested cockroach
that walks near the broken bile that contained

577
00:51:13,024 --> 00:51:17,467
agony, which gives him an electric shock. What
did you think of the mid-credits scene? It

578
00:51:17,487 --> 00:51:22,449
was pretty simple. It was basically just Null
saying that he's gonna burn everything and

579
00:51:22,609 --> 00:51:27,812
you're gonna watch. I thought it was appropriately
scary, but it also just served as a reminder

580
00:51:27,852 --> 00:51:33,495
that we didn't get to see Null, really. Like,
the guy was in shadows the whole time, we didn't

581
00:51:33,515 --> 00:51:37,878
get to see him fight or see what he does. Like,
he's scary, but why should I be afraid of him?

582
00:51:38,318 --> 00:51:42,380
Well, I certainly was afraid of him. Maybe that's
just because I know him from the comic books,

583
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:47,339
so I know how big of a threat he is. but I don't
know how general audiences would feel about

584
00:51:47,379 --> 00:51:51,663
the character. They're probably less afraid
than they should be, is my guess. Because that

585
00:51:51,683 --> 00:51:56,527
dude's no joke. It was his sword, after all,
that Gorr the God Butcher got a hold of, you

586
00:51:56,547 --> 00:52:01,431
know, and he laid waste to a whole pantheon
of gods, so you can just imagine what Null

587
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:07,175
himself can do. Well, it would be nice if they
made that reference, although the MCU kind

588
00:52:07,215 --> 00:52:13,140
of ruined that too. Yeah, yeah, Gorr the God
Butcher in Thor, Living Thunder was not quite

589
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:18,831
the same character, But that's the end of the
film. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, basically

590
00:52:18,851 --> 00:52:25,453
about as much as the first Venom film. I think
Venom the Last Dance offers a heartfelt farewell

591
00:52:25,493 --> 00:52:31,475
to the franchise, while unexpectedly breathing
new life into it, resulting in an uneven but

592
00:52:31,555 --> 00:52:36,316
mostly enjoyable experience. Like the first
Venom movie, I'm rating Venom the Last Dance

593
00:52:36,396 --> 00:52:43,323
3.5 stars, a fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
I think I would have given it a 3, although

594
00:52:43,363 --> 00:52:48,968
I could see how you could argue for 3 and a
half. Just given the hearts of the film, I

595
00:52:49,008 --> 00:52:55,935
think that goes a long way. It was definitely
a heartfelt goodbye at the very end, so walking

596
00:52:55,975 --> 00:53:01,480
out of the theater I could see 3 and a half.
I don't think it was a good movie. I think

597
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:06,885
the acting was fine, but I think the writing
was just the bare minimum of what mediocre

598
00:53:06,925 --> 00:53:13,259
writing should be. I thought the direction was
probably the best of the franchise. So yeah,

599
00:53:13,659 --> 00:53:18,144
I could see the case for three and a half stars.
Story wise, it's a three star film, but then

600
00:53:18,184 --> 00:53:22,949
you have that climax with the group of symbiotes
fighting the xenophages and that bumps it up

601
00:53:22,969 --> 00:53:28,015
a half star on its own. Because I just love
that scene so much. But that does it for this

602
00:53:28,055 --> 00:53:35,208

as we've mentioned several times during this

608
00:54:04,203 --> 00:54:09,187
episode, we're going to have a duel as a tie
into this review where we pit White Lantern

609
00:54:09,267 --> 00:54:14,410
Kyle Rayner against Null. Yeah, I'm a huge Kyle
Rayner fan. He was Green Lantern when I first

610
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:20,414
started reading comic books. So I'm super excited
to showcase him finally. And I'm also glad

611
00:54:20,434 --> 00:54:24,457
that I learned a lot more about Null in this
episode because I really didn't know anything

612
00:54:24,477 --> 00:54:31,114
about him. And I'm already plotting his demise,
as it were. Spoiler alert, Null Fridge's. Kyle

613
00:54:31,154 --> 00:54:35,475
Rayner in the next episode. So look forward
to that. But that does it for this episode.

619
00:55:02,617 --> 00:55:07,441
ground control. I'm stepping through the door,
and I'm floating in a most peculiar way. And

620
00:55:07,481 --> 00:55:08,942
the stars look very different today.
