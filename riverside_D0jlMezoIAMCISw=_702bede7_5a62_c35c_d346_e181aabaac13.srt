1
00:00:03,277 --> 00:00:03,338
you

2
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:27,188
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:27,488 --> 00:00:32,111
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based

4
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:38,255
battle simulations. I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his
twin brother Marvelous Joe. And this episode,

5
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:44,199
we will be talking all about the DC fandom.
All the news to come out of that. It's awesome,

6
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,230
it's amazing. And I guess we'll be talking about
what if as well. We have to review that. Hell

7
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:53,193
yeah, that's the main event of this episode.
We will be reviewing the Disney Plus animated

8
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:58,357
television show What if. Who cares about the
DC stuff? Just skip the news. Actually, I think

9
00:00:58,377 --> 00:01:02,780
this is probably the one episode where people
are most likely to skip the main event Because

10
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,964
we're gonna be talking about the new Batman
trailer, Black Adam's official first look,

11
00:01:07,444 --> 00:01:12,628
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdoms behind-the-scenes
clip, the Flash's first look, the Shazam Fury

12
00:01:12,668 --> 00:01:16,798
of the Gods behind-the-scenes clip We're gonna
be talking about the DC's League of Superpets

13
00:01:16,838 --> 00:01:21,939
teaser trailer, as well as Blue Beetle and Batgirl's
costume concept art, the Peacemaker official

14
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:27,221
teaser, and the Catwoman hunted trailer. There
was a ton of other news to come out of the

15
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:31,682
fandom, but we're gonna be specifically talking
about those items. Yeah, don't forget that

16
00:01:31,702 --> 00:01:36,003
we're also gonna talk about Will Poulter being
cast as Adam Warlock in Guardians of the Galaxy

17
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:40,505
3, which was probably bigger news than anything
to come out of the fandom. Nah, we'll get that

18
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:45,086
shit out of the way right away, real quick.
Then we'll get into the good stuff. As always,

32
00:02:56,356 --> 00:03:01,760
award Marvel used to give out up until the 90s
to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Dual No Prize,

33
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,463
is a digital award we post on social media that
Jonathan personally draws for those who we

34
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:11,190
feel gave the best answer to our question of
the week. For last week's question, we asked,

35
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,993
what was your favorite DCEU film so far and
why? There's been 10 of them. We got a few

36
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:21,314
answers and we want to run down the honorable
mentions before we announce the no prize winner.

37
00:03:21,795 --> 00:03:27,537
Our first honorable mention goes to Marquis
High, who said, Hello gentlemen, this is Marquis

38
00:03:27,657 --> 00:03:34,280
here. I'm just checking in to put my bid in.
I would say there'd be Suicide Squad. James

39
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:39,366
Gunn to me is the one that should be holding
the reins for. just the direction of projects

40
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:45,329
in general. I know that he's a little bit outlandish,
but just his take in the way that all the characters

41
00:03:45,369 --> 00:03:51,911
were able to give their best performance and
adhere to just what we would imagine each of

42
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:58,854
them to be was amazing. Yeah, the Suicide Squad
was what Suicide Squad should have been, hands

43
00:03:58,894 --> 00:04:04,116
down. It captured the tone of the comic, the
zaniness, the violence. Everything you love

44
00:04:04,176 --> 00:04:10,011
about the comic was captured on film by James
Gunn. He's obviously a comic book fan and I

45
00:04:10,091 --> 00:04:15,156
personally wouldn't mind it if he became the
Kevin Feige of DC Comics. I wouldn't want everything

46
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:20,060
to be zany and outlandish, but I think he knows
the source material well enough for that to

47
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:25,004
not happen. Yeah, I agree. I think he has a
great sense for story and for the visual side

48
00:04:25,024 --> 00:04:29,507
of the storytelling. He does come with a little
bit of his own baggage due to the whole drama

49
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:33,731
that happened with him a few years ago. But
the guy is not only one of the best comic book

50
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:38,942
directors, he's one of the most original creative
minds out there right now. Yeah, totally. Our

51
00:04:38,982 --> 00:04:45,207
next honorable mention goes to Corey Wooten
who said, Guys, Corey Wooten here. This list

52
00:04:45,267 --> 00:04:51,031
is getting pretty impressive and this decision
is getting tougher and tougher. Wonder Woman

53
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:58,196
was my favorite a couple years ago. It's phenomenal.
I can watch it over and over. The new Suicide

54
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:05,241
Squad was darn near perfect, but the only answer
is Zack Snyder's Justice League, the best comic

55
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:10,233
book film I've ever seen. Yeah, I mean, honestly,
that's my favorite right now as well. Zack

56
00:05:10,253 --> 00:05:15,097
Snyder's Justice League, again, is what the
theatrical release of the Justice League should

57
00:05:15,117 --> 00:05:21,203
have been. It's by far the most epic DCEU film
to have come out. Yeah, by far. The scale of

58
00:05:21,343 --> 00:05:27,029
Zack Snyder's original vision was just so much
more grand in scope than the first theatrical

59
00:05:27,149 --> 00:05:31,813
Justice League cut that we got. So despite the
fact that I had a hard time sitting through

60
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:36,692
it, I could definitely appreciate why many fans
would view it as their favorite because it

61
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:40,854
just had so much to offer. Yeah, it was a tour
de force and that's exactly what you want a

62
00:05:40,914 --> 00:05:45,897
Justice League film to be. We'll see the story
continue in the upcoming The Flash movie, I

63
00:05:45,937 --> 00:05:50,560
think, and we'll see where we go from there.
Our next honorable mention goes to Brandon

64
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:55,243
Estregard, who said, Alright guys, hopefully
this makes an end on time, but I'm gonna have

65
00:05:55,263 --> 00:06:01,246
to give it to Mattis still. Everything about
the movie, I just love, I love how- Zack Snyder

66
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:07,211
brought these godlike beings to a normal world
like ours. Superman suit. Definitely by far

67
00:06:07,231 --> 00:06:11,955
the best suit that we've had for Superman, in
my opinion. And don't even get me started on

68
00:06:11,995 --> 00:06:19,501
Michael Shannon as the best freaking DCEU villain
ever. It was the best villain, best score,

69
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:24,806
best action. Well, until probably Zack Snyder's
Justice League. But yeah, it's such a good

70
00:06:24,866 --> 00:06:30,134
film. It's definitely one of my favorites in
the DCEU. Probably my favorite until Zack Snyder's

71
00:06:30,174 --> 00:06:34,915
Justice League came out. I know it gets a lot
of hate. I am NOT one of those haters. I love

72
00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:40,857
it I'm one of those haters, but no it has to
be commended for you know Henry Cavill I wish

73
00:06:40,877 --> 00:06:45,238
they would announce like him coming back into
the role right because he was just fantastic

74
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:49,199
Although I think a lot of Superman fans are
getting their fix now from the Superman and

75
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:53,500
Lois television show Which is supposed to have
pretty good Superman action if you guys haven't

76
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:59,482
seen the man of steel in a while check it out
Now pass I was talking to you Suck at everyone

77
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:04,664
else. I saw it recently, it still holds up,
and I think it gets better and better as time

78
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:10,026
goes on, and we get more and more context from
other DCEU films. It perfectly set up that

79
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:13,628
world. That does it for the honorable mentions
before we name the no prize winner, we wanna

80
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:18,590
give a big shout out to CJ Kraft, who took the
time to visit our website and leave his answer.

81
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:24,552
Guys, be sure to go check out his book on Amazon,
Pages of Terror Trilogy of Fear. I got my hardcover

82
00:07:24,572 --> 00:07:28,569
book coming in the mail, and I'm really excited
for it. But the winner. of this week's snow

83
00:07:28,609 --> 00:07:39,459
prize goes to Michael Haggerty who said, wow
wow. Guys, Michael Haggerty here. I have been

84
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:45,543
to the future. You won't believe it. Shhh, shh,
shh. Oh God, it's sucking me back. The Batman

85
00:07:45,683 --> 00:07:52,967
is the best DCEU movie. It's true. It's connected.
The Flash is pretty good too. Michael Keaton

86
00:07:52,987 --> 00:07:56,269
does some good stuff, but the answer is the
Batman. The answer is the Batman.

87
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:10,051
I'm convinced. I'm convinced he went to the
future. I mean, we heard it happen live on

88
00:08:10,091 --> 00:08:16,293
this show. But I don't know if I would consider
the Batman to be DCEU. Maybe it is. Michael

89
00:08:16,353 --> 00:08:21,775
Haggerty just said it was connected. It's part
of the DCEU. He was in the future. How can

90
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:27,516
you deny that? The facts are there. I guess
that's true. But no, yeah, does the DCEU just

91
00:08:27,576 --> 00:08:33,194
refer to the Snyder verse or is it much bigger
than that? I don't know. But. I totally believe

92
00:08:33,234 --> 00:08:37,935
that the Batman will be the best thing that
has ever come out from DC. It looks like the

93
00:08:37,955 --> 00:08:41,556
film is going to be amazing, but we'll get into
that when we break down the latest trailer.

94
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:46,998
So do you think Michael Haggerty is trapped
in the future now? Probably. Just like Back

95
00:08:47,018 --> 00:08:52,519
to the Future 2. Well hopefully he enjoys those
hoverboards. Lucky bastard. Congrats again

96
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:56,280
to Michael Haggerty for winning this week's
No Prize. If you the listener want a shot at

97
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,381
winning your own No Prize, stay tuned to later
on this episode when we'll be asking another

98
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:04,115
question of the week. And now that that's done,
on to the news!

99
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:14,916
Alright, this past week we got some big Marvel
news. Despite the DC fandom, Marvel was still

100
00:09:14,996 --> 00:09:20,138
able to shine with this little gem in that Adam
Warlock has been cast for Guardians of the

101
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:26,001
Galaxy Volume 3. Now he was teased at the end
of the last film with Aisha growing up being

102
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:31,584
called Adam in this gold cocoon-like structure.
And fans have been wondering what was gonna

103
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:37,130
happen with that ever since 2017. Yeah, it's
been one of the major. dangling plot threads

104
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:41,194
that Marvel has put out there that we haven't
really heard anything about until now. Yeah,

105
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:46,358
but with volume 3 set to begin filming within
the next couple of weeks we got the big news

106
00:09:46,438 --> 00:09:52,663
that Will Poulter has landed that role of Adam
Warlock and this was kind of a head-scratcher

107
00:09:52,683 --> 00:09:58,248
for me because I've seen Will Poulter in a few
things and he does not seem like an Adam Warlock

108
00:09:58,288 --> 00:10:04,233
type character who I typically view as like
this Adonis guy just very mysterious this basically

109
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:09,931
perfect being. Yeah, honestly, I thought Adam
Warlock would be taller. And Will Poulter definitely

110
00:10:09,971 --> 00:10:15,834
has this unique look to him. I always think
of him as the funny kid from We're the Millers.

111
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:21,116
Right. Yeah. Or like the annoying cousin from
the Narnia films. He also played this douchebag

112
00:10:21,156 --> 00:10:25,938
racist in Detroit. I heard he was really good
in that. He's played a wide variety of roles,

113
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:30,940
but none of them would lead me to believe that
he is a superhero character. That being said,

114
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,074
James Gunn is obviously brilliant at what he
does. And whatever he has. planned for Adam

115
00:10:36,114 --> 00:10:41,798
Warlock, I believe 100% that Will Poulter is
the man for the job. According to Deadline,

116
00:10:42,138 --> 00:10:47,002
sources are saying that basically his screen
test was too good to pass up. So, if that's

117
00:10:47,042 --> 00:10:51,305
the case, I'm really looking forward to seeing
this. It'll be a little bit weird seeing him

118
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:56,629
in the movies considering that the whole Infinity
Saga is over and I primarily associate Adam

119
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:01,732
Warlock with the Infinity Gauntlet storyline.
It'll be interesting to see what type of role

120
00:11:01,772 --> 00:11:07,176
he plays within the MCU. post Thanos and the
Infinity Stones. Doesn't he have like the soul

121
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:12,160
stone embedded in his forehead? He has had that.
Yeah. I wonder if they'll explore like the

122
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,044
whole soul world that we got to see in some
of the Avengers movies, just like that orange

123
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:20,787
landscape with those films. That would be interesting.
Because that's another kind of dangling plot

124
00:11:20,807 --> 00:11:25,511
thread that they never really addressed. Like
what is that place? I'm curious. Yeah, me too.

125
00:11:25,671 --> 00:11:29,795
I would like to see that. And maybe he could
go in there and like bring back Tony Stark

126
00:11:29,995 --> 00:11:34,166
and Gamora or something like that. Who knows?
I wonder if he's gonna be the bad guy. I think

127
00:11:34,206 --> 00:11:38,889
he'll start out as the bad guy, but since Adam
Warlock is ultimately a hero, he'll probably

128
00:11:38,969 --> 00:11:43,072
switch sides toward the end. That's my guess.
We'll see. Yeah, maybe he'll become like the

129
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:47,055
newest member of the Guardians of the Galaxy.
Yeah, because he was certainly part of that

130
00:11:47,095 --> 00:11:52,659
team in the comics. I'm wondering if maybe we're
going to see him first in Thor, Love and Thunder

131
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:56,561
considering the Guardians of the Galaxy are
going to be in the first part of that film,

132
00:11:56,922 --> 00:12:00,704
or if we're going to see him in the holiday
Christmas special, or if we're going to have

133
00:12:00,724 --> 00:12:06,696
to wait until May of 2023. to finally see him
in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. Hmm. Well,

134
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:12,520
enough of that shit, let's get on to the good
stuff, the DC Fan Dome, starting with the Batman

135
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:17,204
trailer, which was actually the last bit of
news to come out of the Fan Dome. Of course.

136
00:12:17,564 --> 00:12:21,446
It was the only solid news to come out of the
event. What? So of course they were going to

137
00:12:21,466 --> 00:12:25,809
make people sit around for 4 hours before they
got that. Well, I guess you could say it was

138
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:30,633
the only solid trailer for sure to come out
of the event, which was actually honestly kind

139
00:12:30,673 --> 00:12:36,115
of disappointing. But the trailer itself was
not. It was amazing. And honestly, it just

140
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:40,836
got better as it went along. I'm not gonna lie,
early on, I didn't know what to think of it

141
00:12:40,876 --> 00:12:46,437
because I felt like so many of the shots I was
seeing had come from other Batman films, especially

142
00:12:46,597 --> 00:12:51,819
Christopher Nolan's. Everything from like the
scarred back to like the amber lights of Gotham

143
00:12:51,859 --> 00:12:57,000
City night time to like the interrogation scene
in the police station. A lot of it felt familiar.

144
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:01,950
Well, Matt Reeves' Gotham City feels a lot more
like Blade Runner to me. because it's like

145
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:07,673
always raining, it's very dark and drab. It
has a very different feel. It's not quite as

146
00:13:07,733 --> 00:13:12,656
realistic as Nolan's take on Gotham, which felt
very real world. This feels a little bit more

147
00:13:12,756 --> 00:13:17,758
comic booky. Well, we know that Blade Runner
was actually the inspiration for Batman Begins,

148
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:23,141
but I agree with you. This looks a little bit
more like Blade Runner. It has like the same

149
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:27,404
kind of vibes, especially with the opening frame
where we see the Riddler in a coffee shop.

150
00:13:27,764 --> 00:13:32,466
That was a really cool shot. He gets taken by
police. and in his coffee mug is a freaking

151
00:13:32,486 --> 00:13:36,367
question mark that's not that cool like that
didn't make sense to me like why the fuck is

152
00:13:36,387 --> 00:13:40,508
he touching his coffee? don't do that because
he knows that they're coming for him like he

153
00:13:40,548 --> 00:13:45,950
starts making that symbol even before they come
in for him okay I can't wait to see the reaction

154
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:51,212
from the police officer who's like oh guys he
put a question mark in his coffee yeah dude

155
00:13:51,432 --> 00:13:58,058
it's crazy hehehehe after that we get to see
Robert Pattinson as the Batman And he delivers

156
00:13:58,098 --> 00:14:01,720
this cool line where he's talking about the
bat signal and he's like, it's not just a call,

157
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,783
it's a warning. And yeah, these bad guys in
Gotham should totally be afraid of him, because

158
00:14:06,803 --> 00:14:11,686
he's fucking them up. He's like straight up
tasing them in the face, and like, not taking

159
00:14:11,846 --> 00:14:15,488
any bullets. No nonsense from them. See, at
all. That's a little strange to me though,

160
00:14:15,528 --> 00:14:21,591
because since when is Batman Iron Man? He's
never been one to walk into a hail of gunfire

161
00:14:21,631 --> 00:14:25,653
and just have all the bullets ricochet off of
him. He doesn't have that kind of body armor.

162
00:14:26,006 --> 00:14:30,489
You know what he does in this film. It's very
metallic. It's strange because his mask is

163
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:34,853
like made out of leather, but I guess he's wearing
Iron Man armor beneath that. The thing that

164
00:14:34,913 --> 00:14:40,578
always separated Batman from Superman was that
Superman could walk into a hail of bullets,

165
00:14:40,618 --> 00:14:46,603
whereas Batman had to rely on stealth and agility.
This is definitely not that Batman. I thought

166
00:14:46,623 --> 00:14:50,406
it was going to be because Robert Pattinson
is, you know, a slender guy and stuff. I thought

167
00:14:50,426 --> 00:14:55,846
we were going to see some cool acrobatics, but
he's just a tank. That's Actually not a bad

168
00:14:55,947 --> 00:15:00,851
way to describe him. To me, he was very much
like a movie monster in this whole trailer.

169
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:05,054
He was just walking towards you, like Michael
Myers or something like that. Just bullets

170
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:09,939
weren't stopping him, explosions weren't stopping
him. Like there was no escape. I actually really

171
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:13,562
liked that about the character. I don't mind
that he's bulletproof in this version, because

172
00:15:13,582 --> 00:15:17,885
I know ultimately he's still a man and could
still get shot in the face, you know, worst

173
00:15:17,905 --> 00:15:24,030
case scenario. So he's not completely impervious.
He's just a badass. Well, it is about time

174
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,714
that he learned that there's a better way to
avoid gunfire than doing backflips. In some

175
00:15:28,754 --> 00:15:32,657
ways that's an evolution for the character,
but in other ways I do think that maybe he's

176
00:15:32,737 --> 00:15:37,320
lost something with that invulnerability. Hey
man, this is the post Iron Man world! We've

177
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,964
all seen the movie, we all can make, you know,
metal suits of armor, so why not Batman? I

178
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:46,987
have to say though, I don't really like Robert
Pattinson's Bruce Wayne. Like that shot when

179
00:15:47,007 --> 00:15:51,659
he's looking up from behind the newspaper and
he's wearing those glasses. and his weird hairdo,

180
00:15:51,859 --> 00:15:56,463
he looks like Topee McGuire from Spider-Man
3. He looks like that through the whole movie.

181
00:15:56,983 --> 00:16:01,787
During the fandom though, Robert actually said
like, you know, this is still early Batman.

182
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:06,291
This is still him like when he's first starting
out. He hasn't really fully developed his Bruce

183
00:16:06,331 --> 00:16:11,315
Wayne persona yet. Okay. Because that's the
mask. That's what he needs to work on. Batman

184
00:16:11,355 --> 00:16:15,618
comes a little bit easier to him. Interesting.
Okay, I could buy that. I could buy that. The

185
00:16:15,678 --> 00:16:21,198
standouts of this trailer for me were honestly
Catwoman and the Penguin. Freaking Zoe Kravitz

186
00:16:21,358 --> 00:16:26,399
as Selina Kyle is pitch perfect. I would not
be surprised if she gets her own like sequel

187
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:32,181
spin-off from this movie. She looks dead honest
Selina Kyle. She looks phenomenal like from

188
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:36,262
the behind the scenes photos that we saw on
set. I thought she was going to have long hair.

189
00:16:36,602 --> 00:16:41,864
No, dude. She has the short Selina Kyle haircut
from the comics. It's so cool to see. It's

190
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:47,545
like she's straight from the comic page. The
penguin is not necessarily though like in the

191
00:16:47,585 --> 00:16:53,229
comic books. Penguin is like this aristocrat
and here he looks more like a Brooklyn Italian

192
00:16:53,269 --> 00:16:58,793
mobster. Oh yeah dude, Colin Farrell is totally
channeling Robert De Niro. In the movie he's

193
00:16:58,813 --> 00:17:06,038
gonna be like, Kabagool, forget about it! Get
the cannoli! Ma, the lasagna! It's a me Mario!

194
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:12,843
But no, that end scene with him where he's like,
oh I got you! I got you! And then just to see

195
00:17:12,883 --> 00:17:17,826
his face when the Batmobile drips right through
those flames, oh my gosh! I was like on my

196
00:17:17,866 --> 00:17:23,168
feet cheering when I saw that during the fan
dome. It was the coolest moment. It was a fantastic

197
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:27,950
shot to end the trailer where we see upside
down from the Penguin's perspective, Batman

198
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:33,393
walking toward him in the rain. And that music,
that music is so cool. I love the Batman theme

199
00:17:33,433 --> 00:17:38,635
so far. I just can't wait for this movie. And
really we don't have to wait too much longer

200
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:43,397
for this. It's going to come out in quarter
one, 2022, early March. And honestly, I don't

201
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:48,171
need another trailer. Warner Brothers has dubbed
this the main trailer and I'm like, please

202
00:17:48,191 --> 00:17:53,052
let it be the only trailer that we get henceforth
because I am totally sold. Like shut up and

203
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:58,314
take my money. Moving on to our official first
look at Black Adam. I was kind of disappointed

204
00:17:58,354 --> 00:18:03,496
that we didn't get a full trailer. It was really
just like a heavily edited clip from early

205
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:08,457
on in the film when we first get to see Black
Adam emerge according to the Rock. That's how

206
00:18:08,497 --> 00:18:12,930
you described the clip. I thought it was pretty
badass and it did answer a few questions that

207
00:18:12,950 --> 00:18:17,071
we had about the movie, like does any of it
take place in modern times, which it looks

208
00:18:17,111 --> 00:18:22,413
like the film does. Yeah, yeah. In the opening
part of the clip, we get to see Adriana Tomas,

209
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:28,034
who looks like she's some sort of archaeologist
or something, find this like floating crown

210
00:18:28,134 --> 00:18:32,956
that's in this underground tomb it looks like.
And she uncovers this inscription on the ground

211
00:18:33,316 --> 00:18:38,197
and reads the word Shazam, then all of a sudden,
boom, lightning strikes from the sky and Black

212
00:18:38,277 --> 00:18:44,104
Adam emerges. and just fries this guy literally
into ashes. That was fucking crazy. Yeah, it

213
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:48,926
was like a Mortal Kombat fatality. Absolutely,
that's exactly what it felt like, like straight

214
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:53,108
from Injustice. And then they shoot at him and
he catches a bullet and he rises in the air.

215
00:18:53,448 --> 00:18:58,070
But he's taking bullets just like Batman does.
That's a little weird, right? Dude, get over

216
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:03,272
it. It's cool. But yeah, that's pretty much
the entire clip. Before that, we actually got

217
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:07,858
to see the actors who play the different members
of the Justice Society. talk about the film,

218
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:12,100
talk about their characters a little bit. We
got to see their emblems on their suits. I

219
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,723
cannot wait to see Hawkman in full costume.
Ugh, and Dr. Fate, Pierce Brosnan is going

220
00:19:17,743 --> 00:19:21,886
to be awesome as Kent Nelson. Oh yeah, definitely.
I'm so jealous that you have a Bond actor in

221
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:25,928
your films. And you also have Timothy Dalton
in Doom Patrol, so what the hell? James Bond

222
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:29,990
prefers DC, what are you gonna do? Hmm, you
know, The Rock has been looking forward to

223
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:34,012
doing this role for such a long time, and he
even went as far as to say that he was born

224
00:19:34,032 --> 00:19:38,415
to play this role during the fandom. He's the
producer on this film, so you know he's gonna

225
00:19:38,435 --> 00:19:42,418
make it as cool as possible. Because this is
probably gonna be his bread and butter going

226
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:48,082
forward. Is it possible he's not managing his
own expectations for this film? It's the fucking

227
00:19:48,182 --> 00:19:54,807
rock! Hell no! So we have Black Adam, we have
the Batman. I would say my next favorite thing

228
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:59,790
to come out of the fandom would be the behind-the-scenes
clip we got of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.

229
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,393
And it looks like everyone involved, from Jason
Momoa to James Wan to the producer Peter Safran.

230
00:20:04,778 --> 00:20:08,699
are really excited about this story that they're
gonna tell. It looks like from the concept

231
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:13,962
art that they released, like it's gonna be as
epic and as massive as the first one was. It

232
00:20:14,002 --> 00:20:19,225
just takes us so many new places all over the
world. It's gonna be dope. The concept art

233
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:24,327
that we got of this Lost Kingdom looks so interesting.
I thought it was going to be like underwater,

234
00:20:24,407 --> 00:20:29,654
but this movie almost looks like a voyage to
the center of the earth type tale. Yeah, because

235
00:20:29,674 --> 00:20:33,898
you have these giant insects and then you have
like these weird tentacle creatures and like

236
00:20:33,978 --> 00:20:38,621
jungle and stuff like that I'm sure a lot of
it does take place underwater, but this setting

237
00:20:38,661 --> 00:20:42,925
is so fascinating Honestly, I think it's gonna
be a Bermuda Triangle kind of thing because

238
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:48,029
they've played up that angle in the comics before
but yeah They also played like an ice element

239
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:52,813
in the opening titles when they first were introducing
this clip So I wonder if like the Lost Kingdom

240
00:20:52,873 --> 00:20:57,497
is some sort of ice realm Maybe I don't know
but it looks like we're gonna see a lot of

241
00:20:57,537 --> 00:21:02,392
cool things Yeah, there's even like this desert
concept art with these strange creatures. There's

242
00:21:02,412 --> 00:21:07,376
going to be so many different set pieces within
this film. It makes it seem super epic in scope.

243
00:21:07,556 --> 00:21:11,318
Yeah, yeah. I mean, Aquaman looks like it was
really expensive, like it had a lot of money

244
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:16,162
behind it. And this film looks the exact same
way. They streamlined the costumes a little

245
00:21:16,182 --> 00:21:20,485
bit. You know, like we got to see the stealth
suit a little bit better. Aquaman's new blue

246
00:21:20,585 --> 00:21:24,567
outfit that he's going to have for this film.
But we also got to see like a streamlined silver

247
00:21:24,607 --> 00:21:29,571
helmet, black manta, which looks a little bit
more classic. but just as badass and iconic.

248
00:21:30,091 --> 00:21:34,355
Yeah, is his helmet a little bit smaller in
this one? I couldn't tell if it was smaller.

249
00:21:34,615 --> 00:21:39,179
I don't think it was, but his costume overall
is definitely less bulky. It's less of like

250
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:43,582
a suit of armor and more like a sleek wetsuit
kind of thing. We got to see a lot more of

251
00:21:43,642 --> 00:21:48,026
Patrick Wilson as Ocean Master in this clip.
It almost looks like him and his brother, Aquaman

252
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:52,830
team up for this film, which is pretty cool.
Yeah, but I suspect some kind of betrayal down

253
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:58,138
the line. I did notice that they used Amber
Heard as like sparingly as possible. Yeah,

254
00:21:58,158 --> 00:22:02,141
she only appeared in like two quick flashes
of the behind the scenes footage. But it looks

255
00:22:02,161 --> 00:22:06,183
like she's wearing the same suit, which is fine
because that suit was just perfection in the

256
00:22:06,223 --> 00:22:10,706
first film. This film is also coming out next
year, just like the Batman, just like Black

257
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:16,791
Adam. But in December, December 16th, also scheduled
to come out next year is the Flash. That's

258
00:22:16,811 --> 00:22:22,074
coming out in November. And we got a teaser
from that during the fan dome. I was expecting

259
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:27,342
much more from this Flash panel, honestly. The
brief look that we got of the movie. really

260
00:22:27,362 --> 00:22:31,845
didn't get me excited like I thought it would
because it didn't really provide anything new.

261
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:35,268
Like we knew that Michael Keaton's Batman is
gonna be in the movie. We knew what the new

262
00:22:35,508 --> 00:22:39,031
costume is gonna look like, although I will
say it looks pretty impressive in live action.

263
00:22:39,451 --> 00:22:45,436
I think the main takeaway that I got from this
flash first look was that Ezra Miller just

264
00:22:45,456 --> 00:22:50,620
seems like a really unlikable person. Yeah,
it was kind of weird the way he introduced

265
00:22:50,701 --> 00:22:54,243
the clip during the fandom. He was like, this
is me on the set, this is what it looks like

266
00:22:54,283 --> 00:22:58,645
behind me. He was obviously in front of a green
screen. The guy's just trying to be funny,

267
00:22:58,685 --> 00:23:04,269
but it's like, OK, dude. As for the clip itself,
I think it relied a little bit too heavily

268
00:23:04,469 --> 00:23:10,112
on our nostalgia for the Tim Burton Batman film,
which, you know, comes in spades. Don't get

269
00:23:10,132 --> 00:23:14,915
me wrong. I was super excited by, you know,
like the music and everything and seeing the

270
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:20,098
cave. But it is a flash film, and I do want
to see more of the flash and like. Who's gonna

271
00:23:20,118 --> 00:23:25,019
be the villain and different things like that?
I wanted a greater sense of the story. Considering

272
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,800
that this isn't a trailer, it was really only
the briefest of teasers, I guess I'm not surprised

273
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:34,261
that we didn't get that, but I gotta say, this
doesn't get me as excited as some of the other

274
00:23:34,301 --> 00:23:38,943
projects that we saw during the fandom. Because
of how much we don't know about it yet, I guess.

275
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:45,144
What are your thoughts on the costume? I'm not
in love with the mask. The silhouette is all

276
00:23:45,304 --> 00:23:50,042
off, because it doesn't have the protruding
ears. It's just like on his mask. I don't love

277
00:23:50,082 --> 00:23:55,425
it. I much prefer Zack Snyder's Justice League
version. Which version of Ezra Miller do you

278
00:23:55,445 --> 00:24:00,548
prefer? The long haired version without bangs
or the short haired version with bangs? Uh,

279
00:24:01,709 --> 00:24:05,671
I mean I knew that there were going to be two
different versions of Barry Allen maybe in

280
00:24:05,691 --> 00:24:10,354
this film. I thought the other one was going
to be a villain but it looks like he's an ally.

281
00:24:10,714 --> 00:24:15,197
Which is really interesting. It almost seems
like the curly haired version of Barry Allen

282
00:24:15,357 --> 00:24:20,220
is the version from Michael Keaton's Batman's
universe. So it's like I guess it works. There

283
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:25,142
has to be some form of Barry Allen in that world
So I guess Ezra Miller could just play himself

284
00:24:25,182 --> 00:24:29,785
twice. Why not? His hair was a little bit too
close to Sasha Kaye's Supergirl's hair They

285
00:24:29,805 --> 00:24:35,108
all kind of look alike, but oh well. It was
cool to hear Michael Keaton's voice I'll say

286
00:24:35,148 --> 00:24:40,251
that. The line about him like, you know saying
that he could go anywhere anytime Why would

287
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:43,953
he choose to save this universe? It kind of
seems like Michael Keaton is retired and kind

288
00:24:43,993 --> 00:24:48,532
of given up on this world so Maybe we'll get
some Dark Knight Returns angles in there. I

289
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:53,516
don't understand why we didn't get to see Michael
Keaton, at least as Bruce Wayne. Or, you know,

290
00:24:53,536 --> 00:24:57,399
why didn't we get to see the car at the end?
Like, we all know what it looks like. I actually

291
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:01,642
thought the same thing. Right, exactly. There
are just some weird creative choices in this

292
00:25:01,783 --> 00:25:07,827
teaser that we got that, again, not as excited
as I am for other projects. I'm a little more

293
00:25:07,867 --> 00:25:12,531
excited for Shazam! Fury of the Gods, which
we also got a behind the scenes clip for during

294
00:25:12,571 --> 00:25:17,175
the fandom. I really liked the first movie.
I thought they captured the tone perfectly.

295
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:21,639
And it's really cool to see the same characters
back on screen, you know, back in their cool

296
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:26,324
costumes, their updated costumes, they look
really cool. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, these costumes

297
00:25:26,344 --> 00:25:31,028
look much better than the first movie. But we
had already seen this before. I was particularly

298
00:25:31,048 --> 00:25:35,633
interested in seeing what the bad guys look
like with Helen Mirren and Lucy Liu. I think

299
00:25:35,653 --> 00:25:39,877
they look fantastic. I'm really excited for
the Greek mythology angle that they're really

300
00:25:39,917 --> 00:25:44,499
taking this movie. Yeah, I mean, not only did
we get to see Lucy Liu and Helen Mirren as

301
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:48,981
some of the villains, but we also got to see
like some of their goons like Griffins and

302
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:53,863
Cyclops and Harpies and Dragons and stuff like
that. That's exciting. That's really cool.

303
00:25:54,043 --> 00:25:58,665
I can't wait to see like Olympus and you know,
like the Library of Eternity, you know, the

304
00:25:58,685 --> 00:26:02,626
different locations that they were talking about
during this behind the scenes snippet. What

305
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:07,148
did you think of the fact that Jack Dylan Grazer
looks like he's about 20 years old now? He's

306
00:26:07,188 --> 00:26:12,394
almost an adult himself. I mean, it's to be
expected, right? Look at it too and how much

307
00:26:12,414 --> 00:26:17,277
he grew from it one. He was one of my favorite
characters from the first movie. So I'm just

308
00:26:17,337 --> 00:26:22,520
excited that I get to see him again as Freddy.
The first film didn't make that much money

309
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:27,003
at the box office, but I'm really hoping that
this film catches on with audiences because

310
00:26:27,023 --> 00:26:30,104
the first one was so good. And you know, it's
all the same filmmakers and everything like

311
00:26:30,144 --> 00:26:34,187
that. This film, just like Aquaman looks like,
you know, quite a bit of money is being put

312
00:26:34,247 --> 00:26:40,158
into it. So I have high hopes. It's currently
slated to premiere in 2023. And who knows,

313
00:26:40,198 --> 00:26:44,503
maybe we'll get to see Black Adam meet Shazam
in the end credits stinger or something like

314
00:26:44,543 --> 00:26:48,667
that. I really hope so. That would be awesome.
That would be really cool. Speaking of The

315
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:55,734
Rock real quick, though, we also got a teaser
of the DC League of Super Pets film. DC's animated

316
00:26:55,774 --> 00:27:00,839
film that's coming out May of next year. The
Rock is doing the voice of Crypto and Kevin

317
00:27:00,859 --> 00:27:05,595
Hart is doing the voice of Ace the Bat Hound.
It's such a good duo. I always love it when

318
00:27:05,635 --> 00:27:10,137
those two guys team up in movies like with Central
Intelligence and of course the Jumanji films.

319
00:27:10,457 --> 00:27:14,059
I think they have great chemistry and I'm glad
to see them working again together, especially

320
00:27:14,099 --> 00:27:17,921
on a project like this, which I'm actually looking
forward to. I always enjoy like a good, you

321
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:20,963
know, like Pixar movie or something like that.
So I think it's great that they're making this

322
00:27:20,983 --> 00:27:25,666
movie to appeal to a younger demographic. Yeah,
I agree. It's always great to make films for

323
00:27:25,706 --> 00:27:30,368
kids. You know, I love taking my daughters to
see those, but I think I'm not quite ready

324
00:27:30,408 --> 00:27:35,470
to say that this is Pixar caliber. considering
the teaser was mostly just like a pee joke.

325
00:27:35,931 --> 00:27:41,092
And not even a good one. Now who was the pig,
the squirrel, and the turtle? Was that What's

326
00:27:41,132 --> 00:27:45,274
It and Chip? Yeah, I don't know if they're actually
gonna be called What's It and Chip in the film,

327
00:27:45,474 --> 00:27:50,435
but it is the Flash's turtle and Green Lantern's
squirrel. The pig actually belongs to Wonder

328
00:27:50,455 --> 00:27:56,277
Woman, apparently. What? I thought Wonder Woman
had a kangaroo. I guess they decided not to

329
00:27:56,317 --> 00:28:00,780
go that route. for this film. Maybe the kangaroo
is just a little bit too exotic, like you wouldn't

330
00:28:01,041 --> 00:28:05,464
normally see a kangaroo just hopping around
the city. So it's a little bit more conspicuous,

331
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:10,809
I guess, to have a kangaroo. That's weird. I
was a little bit nervous about The Rock doing

332
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:14,532
the voice of Crypto and Kevin Hart doing the
voice of Ace. I kind of figured that those

333
00:28:14,552 --> 00:28:19,516
voices should be reversed, but at least this
trailer did sell me on the voice work and that

334
00:28:19,536 --> 00:28:24,867
they did a great job as their characters. Moving
on to the Blue Beetle movie, we got to see

335
00:28:24,947 --> 00:28:29,790
the filmmakers talk a little bit about the character
and how excited they are for the project, which

336
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:34,813
honestly I wasn't expecting anything more. The
film was only announced fairly recently, but

337
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:39,996
we did get some pretty dope concept art. And
honestly, if it's anything like this in the

338
00:28:40,056 --> 00:28:45,460
actual film, that's gonna be amazing. Yeah,
the art is great. I really love the visual

339
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,595
style that they seem to be incorporating for
this film. I really loved it when Sholo Mareduña,

340
00:28:50,735 --> 00:28:55,639
the guy who's playing Jaime Reyes in the movie,
was kind of gushing about how it is the best

341
00:28:55,719 --> 00:28:59,863
superhero costume in all of superhero films.
And he was like challenging everybody else

342
00:28:59,883 --> 00:29:04,126
to have like a better costume. I really liked
his energy. And the way that the writer and

343
00:29:04,146 --> 00:29:08,650
director were talking about the movie, how he
compares to someone like Peter Parker, whose

344
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:14,118
first instinct was to keep his superhero life
a secret from his family. Whereas within the

345
00:29:14,158 --> 00:29:19,659
Latin family, good luck keeping a secret from
them. So he really shares that secret with

346
00:29:19,699 --> 00:29:25,101
his family within this movie and within the
comics and how that's unique among superhero

347
00:29:25,141 --> 00:29:31,163
alter egos. For sure. Yeah, that's gonna be,
I think, a unique and exciting take on a superhero.

348
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:36,424
As far as the concept art, one interesting thing
about it is that we got to see cord industries

349
00:29:36,684 --> 00:29:41,565
on a building in the background behind the Blue
Beetle character, which to me is really cool.

350
00:29:41,858 --> 00:29:46,000
I wonder if that means Ted Kord will play a
role in this film somehow. I think that would

351
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:50,723
be really cool. Right, because Ted Kord was
the second Blue Beetle in the comic books.

352
00:29:51,263 --> 00:29:56,706
We also got to see the star and filmmakers of
HBO Max's Batgirl film talk about that film

353
00:29:56,806 --> 00:30:01,109
as well as tease some concept art just like
Blue Beetle. Although this concept art wasn't

354
00:30:01,589 --> 00:30:07,032
as good. No, it was nothing. It was basically
just a silhouette among a cityscape. We didn't

355
00:30:07,052 --> 00:30:10,658
get a good feel for what the costume looked
like or anything. I mean, it does look like

356
00:30:10,678 --> 00:30:15,480
she'll have like a yellow-ish cape, and she's
definitely gonna have the red hair. Like they

357
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,342
said that explicitly, that yes, it's Batgirl,
she will have red hair. Interestingly, they

358
00:30:20,382 --> 00:30:25,285
did say that the character was going to be pretty
brutal, so she definitely seems to be in line

359
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:30,427
with, you know, how Ben Affleck played his character.
Just, no nonsense. But that does seem a little

360
00:30:30,447 --> 00:30:35,889
bit out of character, no? Maybe. Maybe not if
it's set in the same Snyderverse universe.

361
00:30:36,298 --> 00:30:40,520
And the filmmakers did imply that Batman would
be making an appearance in this movie. We don't

362
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:45,783
know which Batman yet. I'm really, really hoping
it's been Affleck. But we'll see. One project

363
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:51,407
that I think is in really good hands is Peacemaker.
Of course, James Gunn is doing that. I wasn't

364
00:30:51,447 --> 00:30:55,930
sure how involved he was with the show, but
it sounds like he wrote every single episode,

365
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:00,953
and he directed five out of the eight episodes
of the show, which is really cool that he was

366
00:31:01,013 --> 00:31:06,423
that involved. The cast looks like they're hilarious
together. They have such good chemistry, you

367
00:31:06,443 --> 00:31:10,125
know, whether it's from a Zoom call or, you
know, some of the behind the scenes footage

368
00:31:10,145 --> 00:31:15,287
that we saw. I'm honestly really looking forward
to this more so than I had been prior to this

369
00:31:15,327 --> 00:31:21,390
panel. Well, I remember thinking after the Suicide
Squad movie, if a Peacemaker television series

370
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:26,432
would be successful because he was kind of a
douche, you know, you kind of hated him within

371
00:31:26,492 --> 00:31:31,998
the Suicide Squad film. But seeing this and
seeing the real comedic approach, almost sitcom-esque

372
00:31:32,138 --> 00:31:36,101
approach that they're taking to the characters
makes me pretty excited to see it. Yeah, it's

373
00:31:36,141 --> 00:31:40,963
almost like a workplace comedy or something
like that, you know? Yeah. The official teaser

374
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:46,606
that they put out just had me cracking up so
much. Like, just his interactions with each

375
00:31:46,786 --> 00:31:52,209
one of these different castmates. I cannot get
over how funny this show looks like it's going

376
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:56,872
to be. Yeah, my favorite part was when Vigilante
was like, you know, we're killers, but the

377
00:31:56,892 --> 00:32:03,047
difference about us is that we only kill bad
guys. Usually. Unless there's a mistake. Yeah,

378
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:07,129
yeah, Vigilante looks like he's gonna be hilarious,
which is a pretty interesting take on the character,

379
00:32:07,169 --> 00:32:11,691
but, you know, right up James Gunn's alley.
I also love Eagly, how he's just like sticking

380
00:32:11,731 --> 00:32:15,673
his head out the car window and like giving
hugs and stuff. The butt baby thing went on

381
00:32:15,713 --> 00:32:20,215
for a little long, but uh, it was still funny.
I thought, yeah, I thought it was good. You

382
00:32:20,235 --> 00:32:25,237
know, I thought it was a butt baby until I was
like 14. That explains a lot. The show actually

383
00:32:25,257 --> 00:32:31,342
comes out pretty soon. January 13th, I think
is its debut date on HBO Max. So look forward

384
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:37,067
to that. I definitely am. What I'm less sure
about is Catwoman Hunted, which we got our

385
00:32:37,107 --> 00:32:43,012
first trailer for during the DC fandom. It's
an animated film, and it's very much like an

386
00:32:43,132 --> 00:32:49,177
anime kind of style. But I couldn't quite get
what tone they were trying to capture in this

387
00:32:49,277 --> 00:32:54,701
first trailer. So much like totally Ocean's
11. It's Ocean's 11 meets anime meets superheroes.

388
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:58,548
I'm actually really excited for this. I really
like the funky kind of vibe that they were

389
00:32:58,568 --> 00:33:01,910
giving off for it. I think it'll be a lot of
fun. I mean, it's definitely a heist film,

390
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:05,653
which is what a Catwoman film should be, but
it almost seemed like a parody of the character

391
00:33:05,693 --> 00:33:11,337
as well. You know, there's a little bit of innuendo
and quite a number of cat puns. Yeah, but they

392
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:14,579
kind of address that within the trailer itself
where they're like, don't you get tired of

393
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:19,642
the cat stick? So it's pretty self-aware, I
think. Again, I think it's a parody, which

394
00:33:19,702 --> 00:33:25,374
I guess could work, but it's not really anything
I think most fans were asking for. No, I think

395
00:33:25,494 --> 00:33:30,397
if I am watching a Catwoman centric movie, I
want it to be a fun heist movie. That's exactly

396
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:34,699
what this looks like. I think as long as it's
not too over the top, I think it'll be fine.

397
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,963
We'll see. This film drops February 8th, 2022.
So it's coming up. But that was like all of

398
00:33:41,003 --> 00:33:45,125
the major news, I would say, to come out of
the fandom. What did you think of the fandom

399
00:33:45,245 --> 00:33:50,548
overall? Did you watch it? Watch the fandom?
What? Why would I watch the fandom? You suck.

400
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:58,009
I watched the fandom. I do wish they would have
substituted some of the CW show stuff for upcoming

401
00:33:58,029 --> 00:34:02,112
announcements. There wasn't really anything
new that was announced during this fandom.

402
00:34:02,452 --> 00:34:06,075
And some of the other projects that we have
heard about weren't talked about at all, such

403
00:34:06,135 --> 00:34:12,480
as Green Lantern Corps, any of the JJ Abrams
Justice League dark stuff. Nothing about Michael

404
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:17,823
B. Jordan's Superman movie. I think this fandom
could have been better, if I'm being honest.

405
00:34:18,364 --> 00:34:22,456
We kind of pretty much knew everything we were
going to get. Hopefully if they do this again

406
00:34:22,496 --> 00:34:27,583
next year, and I'm really hoping that they do,
we'll get more movie announcements. But all

407
00:34:27,623 --> 00:34:31,709
in all there was a lot of cool things to come
out from the fandom and we want to know what

425
00:36:12,108 --> 00:36:16,474
this episode, but let's go ahead and get into
our main event now where we review the Disney

426
00:36:16,514 --> 00:36:19,157
Plus animated series, What If.

427
00:36:34,478 --> 00:36:39,381
Alright so What If is an animated series on
Disney Plus that was directed by Brian Andrews,

428
00:36:39,862 --> 00:36:45,165
written and created by A.C. Bradley, and starring
many familiar names and voices from the live

429
00:36:45,226 --> 00:36:51,090
action Marvel Cinematic Universe. It explores
the newly created multiverse that we saw manifest

430
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:55,833
in the Loki television show with a series of
anthological tales told from the perspective

431
00:36:55,994 --> 00:37:01,882
of the Watcher, a cosmic entity who oversees
the events happening in each episode. Each

432
00:37:01,922 --> 00:37:07,625
story is set up with a question of what if.
This reminds us of a single change in the primary

433
00:37:07,745 --> 00:37:14,228
MCU continuity and unfolds the universal effects
from that change. The show is reportedly already

434
00:37:14,268 --> 00:37:18,751
coming back for a second season next year which
is a good thing in my mind because no matter

435
00:37:18,811 --> 00:37:23,994
how I feel about the execution of this first
season, the concept of the show is worthwhile.

436
00:37:24,354 --> 00:37:28,016
Before we get into our thoughts any further
though we want to let you guys know that this

437
00:37:28,096 --> 00:37:33,655
will be a spoiler review as all of our reviews
are. So if you haven't seen What If yet, and

438
00:37:33,675 --> 00:37:38,619
you don't wanna know anything about the show,
go ahead and pause this podcast now and revisit

439
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:44,244
it when you do check it out. I think if you
are a diehard MCU fan who is fascinated by

440
00:37:44,264 --> 00:37:48,947
the new Marvel multiverse, and you want a taste
of it before the new Spider-Man No Way Home

441
00:37:49,147 --> 00:37:52,990
and the Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of
Madness films hit theaters, then check it out

442
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:58,534
for sure. You'll at least find some of the episodes
good, if not interesting. And that's pretty

443
00:37:58,574 --> 00:38:04,578
much how I felt about this season as a whole,
hit or miss. Some episodes were great, some

444
00:38:04,618 --> 00:38:09,201
episodes I just couldn't get into. And that
is somewhat of a disappointment considering

445
00:38:09,281 --> 00:38:14,185
how psyched I was for this series based on the
trailers that were released leading up to its

446
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:20,889
debut. I was the opposite. I was not psyched
for this at all. I really don't care about

447
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:28,150
like Marvel, Elseworld, Tales, alternate universes.
What did save this for me? Possibly is the

448
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:33,074
fact that turned out in the end to be a little
bit less Anthological than I thought it was

449
00:38:33,114 --> 00:38:37,118
going to be you know some of the characters
from some of the previous episodes returned

450
00:38:37,478 --> 00:38:41,822
And that was kind of cool to see them all interact
Yeah And there's also a rumor that some of

451
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:46,926
these characters in these shorts may be showing
up in live action in the multiverse of madness

452
00:38:46,966 --> 00:38:50,809
Movie so that'll be pretty cool if that does
happen and it'll be totally worth watching

453
00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:55,292
this series Before I started watching the show
I was so pumped because I was expecting this

454
00:38:55,433 --> 00:39:02,194
beautifully animated high concept cerebral show
about the nature of fate and choice and causality.

455
00:39:02,854 --> 00:39:08,179
And I think that's what the series tried to
be, but it ended up as a mostly well animated,

456
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:13,603
semi thought provoking affair that didn't quite
live up to the standards set by the MCU's live

457
00:39:13,663 --> 00:39:19,008
action offerings. So yeah, that's probably a
case of me not checking my expectations and

458
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:24,512
I paid the price, but I probably should have
known better because a lot of the what-if comic

459
00:39:24,552 --> 00:39:29,347
books are hit or miss also. You know, there
are some what if comics that are just freaking

460
00:39:29,507 --> 00:39:34,970
epic and mind blowing and so damn good. Like
what if Captain America were revived today?

461
00:39:35,571 --> 00:39:40,994
Or what if Magneto ruled all mutants? Stories
like that. They're not only good, they're kind

462
00:39:41,034 --> 00:39:45,516
of essential reading if you're into those characters.
But you know, there are a lot of duds out there

463
00:39:45,556 --> 00:39:50,879
too. Obviously, that's kind of the nature of
an anthology. But good or bad tales aside,

464
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:58,095
and the comics and the show has both, the potential.
that exists within the what-if concept is worth

465
00:39:58,155 --> 00:40:04,217
more than any single story. The potential to
be introspective and groundbreaking and thought-provoking

466
00:40:04,637 --> 00:40:10,080
is baked right in. You can tell some fucking
awesome stories. The concept itself is the

467
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:15,442
show's greatest asset. But it's also its greatest
hindrance. Yeah, you know, oftentimes I'll

468
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:20,464
complain about a Marvel movie saying, like,
oh, you know, there's a barrier to entry. You

469
00:40:20,504 --> 00:40:24,898
have to do homework and see these other films
before you can really appreciate this and that

470
00:40:24,918 --> 00:40:31,243
makes it inferior. One of the reasons I praised
Shang-Chi was that it was almost standalone.

471
00:40:31,724 --> 00:40:37,829
These stories are not set in the primary continuity
of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It potentially

472
00:40:37,889 --> 00:40:44,695
may not be leading up to some bigger story that's
happening within that universe, but it may

473
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:51,680
also be. So I was kind of torn as to how interested
I should be in the show overall. If you're

474
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,747
saying that some of these characters, are going
to make live action appearances, that's cool,

475
00:40:55,867 --> 00:41:00,470
then I'm really glad I watched it. If they're
not, then like, I really didn't care too much

476
00:41:00,531 --> 00:41:04,513
for it, honestly. Well, I mean, it's just a
rumor. We don't know what's gonna happen in

477
00:41:04,553 --> 00:41:08,456
Multiverse of Madness yet. But you raise an
interesting point about like your interest

478
00:41:08,576 --> 00:41:14,400
in the show. The main problem I have with this
series is that the what if concept inherently

479
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:19,884
doesn't require much investment on behalf of
the audience because any single story anthological

480
00:41:19,984 --> 00:41:25,086
exploration outside of the primary universe
is just a sandbox that the writers can let

481
00:41:25,126 --> 00:41:31,309
thrive or destroy. It technically doesn't affect
anything that matters. We don't have to care

482
00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:36,551
about it essentially. And because we don't have
to be invested, sometimes it's hard to be.

483
00:41:36,991 --> 00:41:41,773
So when I was digging the show, it was good.
But when I wasn't digging the show, it just

484
00:41:41,813 --> 00:41:47,676
felt pointless. Well, I mean, as far as an investment
goes from the audience, they had to have at

485
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:52,946
least have seen the film that the anthological
show riffs on, you know? The Doctor Strange

486
00:41:52,986 --> 00:41:57,530
episode would not make sense so much if you
haven't seen the Doctor Strange film. Same

487
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:02,234
thing for Black Panther or Guardians of the
Galaxy or Captain America, the first Avenger.

488
00:42:02,815 --> 00:42:06,999
I think if you've seen those movies, this show
becomes more interesting, but not everyone

489
00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:13,704
has. So I think this is really a show for the
Marvel diehards, of which I'm not. And honestly,

490
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:17,248
even if you are a Marvel diehard, it doesn't
necessarily mean that you're gonna be invested

491
00:42:17,288 --> 00:42:21,642
in the particular tales that this show has to
tell. Not helping matters, I think, was that

492
00:42:21,843 --> 00:42:27,466
I felt largely detached from the character animation
here. I personally don't connect with animation

493
00:42:27,526 --> 00:42:32,608
as I do with live action. Which was not to knock
the animation, because overall I think the

494
00:42:32,628 --> 00:42:38,011
show is a win visually. Even though the characters
basic movements could be a little stiff, and

495
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:44,515
their faces were soulless abominations. I think
the action was tremendous. And the background

496
00:42:44,555 --> 00:42:49,117
plates were just breathtaking, and the colors...
Oh man, the colors were absolutely gorgeous.

497
00:42:49,778 --> 00:42:54,400
I like how each episode had its own palette
to complement the setting and story. Yeah,

498
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,582
I mean, it's not surprising that the animation
was great. It's Disney. You know, they are

499
00:42:58,622 --> 00:43:03,405
the best when it comes to animation. So yeah,
I figured it would be good. And honestly, it

500
00:43:03,485 --> 00:43:07,930
was better than I thought it was going to be.
The cell shading took a little bit to get used

501
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:13,472
to. It's why I think they opened up with the
Captain Carter story because it had sort of

502
00:43:13,492 --> 00:43:18,833
this like Max Fleischer animation old school
feel to it where you could more easily accept

503
00:43:18,893 --> 00:43:23,734
the cell shading. And while some scenes, particularly
dialogue heavy scenes kind of seems like they

504
00:43:23,754 --> 00:43:28,176
were pulled out of like a video game cut scene.
I think the action is where the show really

505
00:43:28,216 --> 00:43:33,677
shined. Yeah, the dialogue scenes seemed like
very cheap but I think they spared no expense

506
00:43:33,717 --> 00:43:39,636
when it came to the action, you're right. Overall,
this series did get me thinking about the nature

507
00:43:39,717 --> 00:43:45,241
of alternate universe stories, their purpose,
and what makes them good. So one of the purposes

508
00:43:45,401 --> 00:43:50,525
of an alternate universe tale is to provide
a new perspective on the primary universe in

509
00:43:50,565 --> 00:43:55,849
a story not bound by the confines of canon.
You learn how changes in continuity affect

510
00:43:55,969 --> 00:44:00,933
or don't affect the characters we know and love
and we see how large their role really is in

511
00:44:00,953 --> 00:44:05,921
their greater universe. These type of tales
are reimaginings, essentially, like 1602 for

512
00:44:05,961 --> 00:44:12,166
Marvel or The Dark Knight Returns for DC. Another
purpose of alternate universe tales is to experiment

513
00:44:12,346 --> 00:44:18,492
with the primary universe by telling a story
seemingly set within that continuity but involving

514
00:44:18,552 --> 00:44:24,317
events that could not or should not happen within
that world. Something like Marvel Zombies or

515
00:44:24,417 --> 00:44:30,368
Injustice. What an alternate universe story
should not be is essentially a retelling of

516
00:44:30,388 --> 00:44:36,090
a previous story with some minor elements changed.
And I think that was a mistake that this show

517
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:42,132
made occasionally. The episodes that departed
heavily from the MCU were more interesting

518
00:44:42,152 --> 00:44:46,354
to me than those that essentially served to
tell the same story with a twist. Because the

519
00:44:46,394 --> 00:44:51,236
episodes that did that just told essentially
a less interesting tale than the original.

520
00:44:54,998 --> 00:45:01,042
were more engaging. I felt the same way. Absolutely.
You know, I love Elseworld Tales. I love these

521
00:45:01,142 --> 00:45:06,966
alternate reality stories. My favorite DC Comics
storyline is an Elseworld Tale, Kingdom Come,

522
00:45:07,266 --> 00:45:10,668
and that definitely isn't retreading anything
new. It's charting new territory. You know,

523
00:45:10,688 --> 00:45:15,512
it's asking like, what if this happened in the
future? And that's a really cool notion to

524
00:45:15,532 --> 00:45:20,916
me. I think one of the reasons, you know, in
the comics, the New 52 failed was because a

525
00:45:20,956 --> 00:45:25,451
lot of fans didn't want to see like slightly
altered. takes of storylines that they were

526
00:45:25,491 --> 00:45:29,915
already familiar with. Yeah, no, yeah, that's
a great example for sure. And as we go down

527
00:45:29,955 --> 00:45:34,238
this episode breakdown, we're definitely gonna
be able to point out which of these stories

528
00:45:34,518 --> 00:45:38,662
lacked originality and which ones were more
compelling. So let's go ahead and do that.

529
00:45:39,042 --> 00:45:44,426
The first episode was called, What If Captain
Carter Were the First Avenger? It had Jeffrey

530
00:45:44,446 --> 00:45:49,451
Wright as the watcher, who I freaking loved
in this entire series. I think Jeffrey Wright

531
00:45:49,471 --> 00:45:56,147
has such a commanding voice full of presence.
You believe that the dude is a cosmic entity,

532
00:45:56,387 --> 00:46:01,210
you know, and you know, he's doing the voice
for Batman in the audio adventures on HBO Max.

533
00:46:01,330 --> 00:46:06,073
Yeah. And he's playing commissioner Gordon in
the Batman. Yeah. The guy is just fantastic.

534
00:46:06,133 --> 00:46:10,476
I can't get enough Jeffrey Wright. He needs
to be in every single project. This first episode

535
00:46:10,536 --> 00:46:16,460
also had Haley Atwell as Captain Carter. Chris
Evans was not in this. He was played by a guy

536
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:21,670
named Josh Keaton who I thought did a bang up
job. Ross Markand who played the Red Skull

537
00:46:21,770 --> 00:46:26,611
in the Endgame movie relent his voice to the
character here and Sebastian Stan played Bucky

538
00:46:26,631 --> 00:46:34,033
Barnes in the worst voice performance ever given
ever. The plot of the episode is, during World

539
00:46:34,053 --> 00:46:38,995
War II, a Hydra spy shoots and injures Steve
Rogers before he can undergo project rebirth.

540
00:46:39,435 --> 00:46:44,996
SSR agent Peggy Carter kills the spy and steps
in to receive the serum instead. Howard Stark

541
00:46:45,096 --> 00:46:50,414
equips her with a uniform and shield and she
becomes Captain Carter. She steals the Tesseract

542
00:46:50,434 --> 00:46:56,198
from Hydra and Stark uses it to build the Hydra
Stomper Armor, which Steve Rogers pilots. The

543
00:46:56,298 --> 00:47:01,922
armor gets captured and Red Skull uses the Tesseract
to summon an interdimensional monster. Captain

544
00:47:01,962 --> 00:47:06,826
Carter and her allies rescue Steve and she pushes
the creature back into the other dimension.

545
00:47:07,286 --> 00:47:13,210
70 years later, she returns, having not aged
a day. Now I think right off the get go, we

546
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:19,058
realize that the entire premise for the episode
is not necessarily just set up. by the question

547
00:47:19,098 --> 00:47:23,021
of the episode. You know, this episode is titled,
What If Captain Carter Were the First Avenger?

548
00:47:23,322 --> 00:47:28,305
The Watcher states that the change in this universe
was that Peggy Carter decided to stay on the

549
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:33,450
testing room floor, but really you see a whole
bunch of different circumstances that dictate

550
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:39,614
the flow of this story, such as, you know, the
Hydra agent in the MCU movie was sent to observe

551
00:47:39,654 --> 00:47:44,350
the experiment to see if it was a success and
then capture the Super Soldier Serum. In this

552
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:49,991
episode, he was sent to prevent the test from
ever taking place. So little things like that.

553
00:47:50,111 --> 00:47:55,793
I did like this episode. This was actually one
of my maybe top three episodes of the whole

554
00:47:55,853 --> 00:48:01,594
series. Yeah, I really like how it kind of took
similar themes from the Agent Carter television

555
00:48:01,634 --> 00:48:06,536
series, live action, that got two seasons. The
feminist themes of like the guy is not wanting

556
00:48:06,556 --> 00:48:11,097
to let the girls out in the field and like she
goes out there and she just absolutely kicks

557
00:48:11,157 --> 00:48:16,451
ass. If anything, It seemed like she kicked
more ass than Captain America did, considering

558
00:48:16,471 --> 00:48:21,752
that she actually like acquired the Tesseract
while it was in transition. That's what I was

559
00:48:21,792 --> 00:48:27,074
thinking. Yeah. She was like a better version
of Captain America than Steve Rogers almost.

560
00:48:27,094 --> 00:48:31,955
She was definitely more lethal. She was straight
up like killing dudes with that shield. How

561
00:48:31,995 --> 00:48:35,956
hard she was hitting them. I thought it was
pretty crazy. But I thought it was really clever

562
00:48:36,056 --> 00:48:42,519
how the story used the Tesseract as kind of
like an early arc reactor. the thing that powered

563
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:48,344
the hydra stopper armor and how Steve Rogers
was the one to pilot that suit. That was cool.

564
00:48:48,524 --> 00:48:52,808
It's actually pretty, I think, interesting to
have Steve Rogers out in the field with Peggy.

565
00:48:52,848 --> 00:48:57,432
He was like her iron giant. It reminded me kind
of like, you know, like Stargirl and Stripesy

566
00:48:57,492 --> 00:49:03,257
in a way. Yeah, definitely. That scene where
they're doing the aerial combat with the Nazi

567
00:49:03,297 --> 00:49:08,742
fighter planes was really badass. I could watch
that all day. That was amazing. I think the

568
00:49:08,762 --> 00:49:13,443
story did lose a little bit in the third act
right after Steve gets captured by Hydra after

569
00:49:13,483 --> 00:49:18,685
the train explosion and they go to rescue him
in that Nazi castle. It was interesting how

570
00:49:18,965 --> 00:49:24,567
Red Skull chose to use the Tesseract as a portal
as opposed to a weapons energy source like

571
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:29,089
he did in the live action film. Right. Yeah,
that definitely was another detour that they

572
00:49:29,129 --> 00:49:34,042
took from the actual film. I did think that
the monster that he summoned was pretty cool

573
00:49:34,082 --> 00:49:39,864
though. Seeing Captain Carter with his sword
and shield fight this like mythological Cthulhu

574
00:49:39,904 --> 00:49:45,286
type monster, reminded me a lot of like Wonder
Woman actually. Yeah. I thought that the creature

575
00:49:45,306 --> 00:49:49,887
was actually going to be Shuma Gorath and that
it was going to tie into a Dr. Strange story

576
00:49:49,927 --> 00:49:54,328
down the line, but I think it was just this
tentacle beast. Yeah. You can't do Shuma Gorath

577
00:49:54,388 --> 00:50:00,222
now that you know, DC did Starro. Sorry. Completely
different character, but. I did think that

578
00:50:00,262 --> 00:50:06,444
it was entirely ridiculous that this huge ass
tentacle monster was able to be essentially

579
00:50:06,484 --> 00:50:11,985
just pushed back through the portal with her
little shield. You know? That was so dumb.

580
00:50:12,005 --> 00:50:18,187
She sold it, I thought. Did she? Okay. Me, I
was like, what's this bullshit? Like it just

581
00:50:18,207 --> 00:50:22,528
got done freaking killing the red skull and
it was like destroying this entire castle and

582
00:50:22,548 --> 00:50:28,190
she just kind of like walked it right back in.
That's fair. Overall, I mean, I did- like this

583
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:34,031
episode I rated a three out of five stars mainly
because I felt like I'd already seen most of

584
00:50:34,071 --> 00:50:38,693
the story especially if you've seen Agent Carter
I think a lot of the themes that this episode

585
00:50:38,713 --> 00:50:43,134
tried to play up were done better within that
series. See I haven't seen that series I thought

586
00:50:43,154 --> 00:50:47,755
this was one of the more original episodes actually
so I'd like to I'd probably give it like a

587
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:53,777
three and a half four. The next episode two
was called What if T'Challa Became a Star Lord?

588
00:50:54,097 --> 00:50:59,531
This episode. actually had Chadwick Boseman
in one of his last performances as the character,

589
00:50:59,611 --> 00:51:04,952
he played Star-Lord T'Challa. It was really
nice hearing him in this role again. The episode

590
00:51:04,993 --> 00:51:11,554
also starred Michael Rooker as Yondu, Josh Brolin
as Thanos, Benicio del Toro as the Collector,

591
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:18,337
Karen Gillan as Nebula, and Jimon Honsu as Korath
the Pursuer. In the story, the Ravagers mistakenly

592
00:51:18,377 --> 00:51:23,746
kidnap T'Challa as a child instead of Peter
Quill. He grows up to be a famous galactic

593
00:51:23,766 --> 00:51:28,868
hero known as Star-Lord who steals from the
rich and gives to the needy. He plots with

594
00:51:28,928 --> 00:51:34,791
Nebula to steal a magic bean-like artifact called
the Embers of Genesis from the Collector. While

595
00:51:34,831 --> 00:51:40,353
searching for it, T'Challa discovers a Wakandan
spacecraft and learns his home was not destroyed

596
00:51:40,413 --> 00:51:45,335
like Yondu told him. He fights the Collector
for the artifact and wins with his allies help.

597
00:51:45,716 --> 00:51:51,138
He forgives Yondu for lying to him and reunites
with his family back on Earth. This episode

598
00:51:51,158 --> 00:51:55,122
I actually didn't love too much. It was actually
my least favorite episode. It was also one

599
00:51:55,142 --> 00:52:00,527
of my least favorite episodes. Partly because
I think T'Challa is much cooler as Black Panther

600
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:05,892
and Peter Cool is much cooler as Star-Lord.
So to see a less cool version of Star-Lord

601
00:52:06,132 --> 00:52:11,236
was not interesting. I think the way they played
up his character, especially when it involved

602
00:52:11,296 --> 00:52:15,570
Korath and how he like... Idolized Star-Lord
and everything like that. I thought it got

603
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:20,652
a little bit ham-fisted, you know Absolutely
T'Challa is out there essentially saving the

604
00:52:20,732 --> 00:52:26,914
universe being such an influence over the galaxy
Even convincing someone like Thanos to not

605
00:52:26,974 --> 00:52:33,316
be Thanos. That was fucking weird a stretch
I'll say you know if he could convince Thanos

606
00:52:33,636 --> 00:52:38,317
to give up his agenda Like why didn't he think
to do that during Avengers Endgame? Like he

607
00:52:38,337 --> 00:52:41,346
could just talk him out of it I guess that doesn't
make sense because they were in the middle

608
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:46,127
of a battle. But like if you could convince
the mad Titan to abandon his goal, then we

609
00:52:46,147 --> 00:52:51,489
should have saw that type of diplomatic reasoning
in Black Panther with Killmonger. Oh, totally.

610
00:52:51,689 --> 00:52:56,410
That's like convincing dark side to give up
his search for the anti-life equation. Exactly.

611
00:52:56,770 --> 00:53:01,632
No, that's the character. It's bullshit. Yeah.
I think that was the moment where I was like,

612
00:53:02,112 --> 00:53:09,346
fuck this episode. And like the whole premise
of this. episode was supposed to be like nature

613
00:53:09,366 --> 00:53:14,348
versus nurture. Like, are you going to be the
same person, even if you grow up in a different

614
00:53:14,388 --> 00:53:18,950
environment? And I think this episode tried
to show that, yeah, T'Challa has such a strength

615
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:24,173
of character that he remained the same honorable
person despite the fact that he was captured

616
00:53:24,213 --> 00:53:31,316
by a bunch of thieves. And while that sentiment
is nice, the execution was crap. Like he completely

617
00:53:31,336 --> 00:53:36,486
transformed what the Ravagers were all about.
He had too much influence. on everyone from

618
00:53:36,606 --> 00:53:42,968
Nebula to Korath that I think just did not seem
realistic. It made so many characters less

619
00:53:43,068 --> 00:53:47,569
interesting. Like I mean, I think things got
a little bit better when I thought Nebula had

620
00:53:47,609 --> 00:53:52,611
betrayed him. But then that turned out to all
be like a ruse as well and I was like ugh.

621
00:53:52,971 --> 00:53:57,112
It was cool to see Howard the Duck. I think
Seth Green did his voice, right? Yeah, he did.

622
00:53:57,333 --> 00:54:01,526
Howard the Duck showed up in a few episodes
here. That was fantastic. The Embers of Genesis

623
00:54:01,566 --> 00:54:05,747
was an interesting plot point that I feel like
would absolutely destroy any planet that they

624
00:54:05,767 --> 00:54:11,349
tried to use it on. I did think it was touching
when T'Challa returned home and had that nice

625
00:54:11,369 --> 00:54:14,870
celebration with his family. Although there
was kind of like a bittersweet ending when

626
00:54:14,910 --> 00:54:19,551
we see Peter Quill working at Dairy Queen and
then he's approached by his father Ego who

627
00:54:19,691 --> 00:54:23,732
uses him to essentially take over the universe
and fulfill his plot from Guardians of the

628
00:54:23,752 --> 00:54:29,614
Galaxy volume 2. Overall though I think I give
this episode a 2.5 out of 5. It was definitely

629
00:54:29,674 --> 00:54:34,618
my least favorite just because the plausibility
of it all. Yeah, I think that's a fair rating.

630
00:54:34,698 --> 00:54:39,841
Two and a half, two stars. That's probably my
rating as well. Episode three was titled, What

631
00:54:39,881 --> 00:54:45,685
If the World Lost Its Mightiest Heroes? It starred
Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Jeremy Renner

632
00:54:45,705 --> 00:54:51,469
as Hawkeye, Mark Ruffalo as Hulk, Tom Hiddleston
as Loki. Lake Bell, I thought gave a pretty

633
00:54:51,509 --> 00:54:56,953
convincing Black Widow performance. I think
she mostly hit the right notes to mimic Scarlett

634
00:54:56,973 --> 00:55:00,552
Johansson. I didn't realize that was like Belle.
Yeah, I thought she did a really good job.

635
00:55:00,732 --> 00:55:04,896
She's just a really talented voice actress in
general. Yeah, she also plays Poison Ivy in

636
00:55:04,916 --> 00:55:09,119
the Harley Quinn animated series. That's right,
yep. Robert Downey Jr. wasn't here. It was

637
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:13,683
a guy named Mick Wingert who played Iron Man.
And of course, Michael Douglas returned as

638
00:55:13,783 --> 00:55:18,607
Hank Pym. The story goes that during the time
around Iron Man 2, The Incredible Hulk and

639
00:55:18,627 --> 00:55:24,392
Thor, the original Avengers Initiative candidates
are mysteriously killed, including Iron Man,

640
00:55:24,492 --> 00:55:30,017
Thor, Hawkeye, and Hulk. Black Widow investigates
and tells Fury their murders are related to

641
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:35,842
Hope before getting killed herself. Loki arrives
on Earth to avenge Thor, but Fury bargains

642
00:55:35,862 --> 00:55:41,626
with him to bring the killer to justice. He
deduces its Hank Pym as Yellowjacket, who is

643
00:55:41,666 --> 00:55:47,692
upset that his daughter Hope died under S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
watch. Hank tries to kill Nick Fury, but Loki

644
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:53,557
stops him and later vows to conquer Earth. Fury
finds new Avengers recruits in Captain America

645
00:55:53,697 --> 00:55:57,940
and Captain Marvel. I really liked this one.
What? It was pretty good. This was like my

646
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:03,865
second to least favorite episode of the whole
season. Really? This one was really dumb, I

647
00:56:03,905 --> 00:56:08,970
thought, actually. The way like that twist ending,
which honestly was spoiled for me, because

648
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:14,274
I tend to watch things with subtitles. So when
Black Widow was talking about how it's all

649
00:56:14,314 --> 00:56:19,619
about hope, hope was capitalized. Oh no. So
I realized that she was talking about Hope

650
00:56:19,639 --> 00:56:25,330
Van Dyne, right? And I was like, oh, this is
stupid. I really liked revisiting some of the

651
00:56:25,370 --> 00:56:31,772
scenes from those earlier MCU movies, especially
seeing Mark Ruffalo in the scene from the Incredible

652
00:56:31,812 --> 00:56:36,773
Hulk movie when he's escaping that university
and Thunderbolt Ross' troops are closing in

653
00:56:36,813 --> 00:56:41,995
on him. It was pretty novel, I think, to see
that actor in that scene. And like the way

654
00:56:42,035 --> 00:56:46,056
he died, like exploding, I thought it was pretty
crazy. I was like, what the hell is going on?

655
00:56:46,316 --> 00:56:50,837
Like how Hawkeye ended up killing Thor, you
know, and then he died himself while in custody.

656
00:56:51,217 --> 00:56:55,524
I thought it was actually a- pretty solid mystery.
And when they finally revealed that it was

657
00:56:55,564 --> 00:57:02,150
Yellowjacket, Hank Pym turned evil, I thought
it was a pretty true homage to his darker turns

658
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:08,055
within the comic books. Didn't you think that
the whole twist that Hope died in a scene that

659
00:57:08,075 --> 00:57:13,941
we never saw in a character that had never been
mentioned prior in the episode was a cheap

660
00:57:14,041 --> 00:57:19,005
twist though? Maybe, but I don't think it was
cheap if you know Hank Pym's history in the

661
00:57:19,045 --> 00:57:23,759
comics. At face value, yeah, you're probably
right. Like shouldn't he have been upset about

662
00:57:23,819 --> 00:57:29,262
like Janet maybe? Why? Because she was a S.H.I.E.L.D.
agent who died. You know, we didn't see or

663
00:57:29,322 --> 00:57:33,884
hear about Hope dying prior, so we would never
have suspected that. That's true. Yeah, but

664
00:57:34,144 --> 00:57:38,126
then I guess you would have had the clever wordplay
about how it's about Hope. Why couldn't Black

665
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:43,769
Widow have just said, it's fucking Hank Pym?
Like why even have wordplay? So dumb. I don't

666
00:57:43,869 --> 00:57:48,579
know. I liked it. I liked it. I especially like
how at the end we get to see like joining of

667
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:52,480
a new Avengers team involving Captain America
and Captain Marvel. But that also doesn't make

668
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:57,102
sense too because Captain America was the first
Avenger. So why would he be like on a backup

669
00:57:57,162 --> 00:58:02,945
list of the Avengers? Because he wasn't discovered
in the ice until after the events of Iron Man

670
00:58:02,985 --> 00:58:07,967
2, Incredible Hulk and Thor. Oh, that's true.
Okay, nevermind. I actually rate this episode

671
00:58:07,987 --> 00:58:14,969
a four out of five. I would give this episode
like a 1.5 or two out of five. Geez. It sucked.

672
00:58:15,518 --> 00:58:21,961
Episode 4 was called What If Dr. Strange Lost
His Heart Instead of His Hands. It stars Benedict

673
00:58:21,981 --> 00:58:27,004
Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange, Rachel McAdams as
Christine Palmer, Benedict Wong as Wong, and

674
00:58:27,044 --> 00:58:32,267
Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One. After losing
his girlfriend Christine Palmer in a car crash,

675
00:58:32,507 --> 00:58:37,830
Dr. Stephen Strange learns the mystic arts and
uses the Time Stone to try and save her. The

676
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:43,373
Ancient One instructs him that her death is
an absolute point in time that cannot be reversed.

677
00:58:43,806 --> 00:58:48,807
and she splits Doctor Strange into two versions
of himself so that the good version may one

678
00:58:48,847 --> 00:58:54,489
day stop the misguided version. The misguided
version becomes all powerful by absorbing mystical

679
00:58:54,529 --> 00:59:00,230
beings, eventually absorbing his counterpart
and transforming into the monstrous Doctor

680
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:06,592
Strange Supreme. He resurrects Christine Palmer,
but the temporal paradox destroys reality and

681
00:59:06,652 --> 00:59:12,193
leaves Doctor Strange Supreme as the sole survivor
of an empty universe. I loved this episode.

682
00:59:12,458 --> 00:59:16,381
I think it's my favorite episode. Yeah, I would
say it's my favorite episode as well. I mean,

683
00:59:16,421 --> 00:59:20,806
I think the episode should have been titled,
what if Dr. Strange drove Christine Palmer

684
00:59:20,906 --> 00:59:25,250
to his award ceremony, but losing his heart
instead of his hands just sounds better. I

685
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:31,096
mean, that is definitely a huge alteration from
the movie and that she was in the car with

686
00:59:31,136 --> 00:59:36,000
him, but other than that, I thought it was pretty
good. I think Rachel McAdams totally forgot

687
00:59:36,101 --> 00:59:41,815
who her character. was in this performance because
she was like so flirtatious and like so sexy

688
00:59:41,855 --> 00:59:47,837
voiced. Whereas Christine Palmer in the movie
was not very flirtatious. She was very like

689
00:59:47,897 --> 00:59:52,298
straightforward and caring and everything, but
definitely not like sexified. Yeah, did they

690
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:57,879
even have like a romantic relationship in the
movie? I mean, there were exes, so it was slight.

691
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:03,061
One of the things I really liked about this
episode was just seeing the ancient one and

692
01:00:03,101 --> 01:00:08,736
Dr. Strange interact again, but Also the use
of magic, like the way Dr. Strange Supreme

693
01:00:08,756 --> 01:00:13,660
became all powerful, how he kind of like started
with some of the weaker mystical beings and

694
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:18,244
then slowly worked his way up the totem pole.
I thought that was pretty fascinating. I also

695
01:00:18,304 --> 01:00:24,048
liked when Wong and the good Dr. Strange were
doing their spell writing, the way that manifested

696
01:00:24,068 --> 01:00:28,391
with like these mystical text characters in
the air and how they were just kind of pulling

697
01:00:28,411 --> 01:00:33,518
them out and like working them that way. Yeah,
that was cool. I hope we see that kind of magical

698
01:00:33,579 --> 01:00:37,621
visual language utilized within the live action
films because I think that'd be cool to see.

699
01:00:38,141 --> 01:00:44,164
And it was so tragic, the ending, how everything
just kind of like turned black and like floated

700
01:00:44,204 --> 01:00:48,926
away. And like he became like the sole survivor
in this universe just trapped all alone for

701
01:00:48,986 --> 01:00:53,389
all eternity. And how he like pleaded with the
watcher and the watcher was like, no dice.

702
01:00:53,709 --> 01:00:58,307
You did this to yourself, bro. It was cool to
see the Watcher interact with the Dark Doctor

703
01:00:58,327 --> 01:01:02,189
Strange. I thought actually that was a really
cool aspect of this episode. The fact that

704
01:01:02,249 --> 01:01:06,451
the Watcher broke the fourth wall in a way.
Yeah, I love every time he broke the fourth

705
01:01:06,491 --> 01:01:12,213
wall. I loved every time that we saw him gazing
upon the events from the sky in the background.

706
01:01:12,573 --> 01:01:16,895
He shows up quite frequently in these stories.
Yeah, it was always kind of a treat to see

707
01:01:16,915 --> 01:01:21,577
him just in the sky in the background. I actually
liked that. I was like, oh, it's Wat 2. That's

708
01:01:21,617 --> 01:01:25,837
cool. Overall, this episode I think was the
best. I give it four and a half stars out of

709
01:01:25,857 --> 01:01:31,121
five. Yeah, I'd give it the same rating. The
fifth episode was called, What If Zombies?

710
01:01:31,641 --> 01:01:35,885
And it stars Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk, Chadwick
Boseman as Black Panther, Paul Bettany as Vision,

711
01:01:35,965 --> 01:01:41,149
Sebastian Stan as Winter Soldier, Evangeline
Lilly as Wasp, Paul Rudd as Ant-Man, Jon Favreau

712
01:01:41,169 --> 01:01:46,254
as Happy Hogan, Danai Gurira as Okoye, Emily
Van Camp as Sharon Carter, David Smolchin as

713
01:01:46,314 --> 01:01:50,657
Kurt, and Hudson Thames as Spider-Man. They
apparently, they couldn't get Tom Holland.

714
01:01:51,126 --> 01:01:56,009
But in the story, Hank Pym brings back a zombie
virus from the Quantum Realm while trying to

715
01:01:56,069 --> 01:02:01,493
rescue his wife Janet, causing a zombie apocalypse.
With most of Earth's heroes as the Walking

716
01:02:01,533 --> 01:02:07,737
Dead, a small band of survivors try and find
a potential cure at Camp Lehi. They find Vision,

717
01:02:07,797 --> 01:02:12,840
who can cure the virus using the Mind Stone,
but not the Scarlet Witch, who is too powerful.

718
01:02:13,181 --> 01:02:17,924
He rips out his Mind Stone in atonement for
feeding victims to the Scarlet Witch and gives

719
01:02:17,964 --> 01:02:22,567
it to the Black Panther, Spider-Man, and Ant-Man.
who head to Wakanda to broadcast the stone's

720
01:02:22,627 --> 01:02:28,693
frequency around the world. However, a zombified
Thanos is already waiting for them there. This

721
01:02:28,753 --> 01:02:34,277
was, I think, a really fun episode in that it
played almost exactly like how a zombie movie

722
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:39,081
would, albeit with Marvel superheroes that we
know and love from other movies. Yeah, that

723
01:02:39,121 --> 01:02:43,505
was cool. Yeah, I love how Peter was like, haven't
you guys ever seen a horror film? When they

724
01:02:43,525 --> 01:02:47,348
were talking about splitting up and stuff like
that. Yeah, it was good. It was almost like

725
01:02:47,428 --> 01:02:53,088
meta in a way. Yeah. Most zombie movies involve,
you know, a small group of people just trying

726
01:02:53,108 --> 01:02:58,731
to survive and slowly but surely most, if not
all of them get picked off by the zombie hoard.

727
01:02:59,031 --> 01:03:02,953
Most zombie movies don't have a great ending
and the same goes for this one. I like how

728
01:03:02,973 --> 01:03:07,536
they started out with like a large group and
that they each started dying like happy Hogan

729
01:03:07,716 --> 01:03:13,159
on the train and then Bucky when he discovers
the Scarlet witch. Scarlet witch was so freaking

730
01:03:13,219 --> 01:03:17,902
scary. Like when she blasts open that door and
you just see her silhouette. and how she's

731
01:03:17,922 --> 01:03:22,364
like hunched over the way they animated her
movements kind of reminded me of the chick

732
01:03:22,404 --> 01:03:28,207
from the ring. And I was like, oh, shit, Baba
Yaga. It was a really dark turn. Like this

733
01:03:28,247 --> 01:03:32,229
is probably some of the darkest shit that Disney
has ever done when like you have the reveal

734
01:03:32,289 --> 01:03:38,632
that the vision has been feeding people to Wanda.
Yeah, he fed Wanda like Black Panther's leg,

735
01:03:38,752 --> 01:03:44,200
I think. Yeah. Fucking crazy. And it was so
weird. Like, I think he was rationalizing it

736
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:49,225
by saying that he was preventing her chaos from
unleashing upon the earth. But he could have

737
01:03:49,305 --> 01:03:53,508
easily destroyed her. And they ask him why he
didn't. And like, at that point, he realizes

738
01:03:53,528 --> 01:03:57,892
how much he fucked up because he doesn't have
a good reason for why he didn't just kill her.

739
01:03:58,092 --> 01:04:01,655
You know, obviously, it's because he loves her,
but it wasn't worth the lives of all those

740
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:06,539
innocent people, you know? Right. Love is not
always logical. And he's supposed to be this

741
01:04:06,579 --> 01:04:12,008
logical creature. When he realizes that. His
decision making wasn't based in logic like

742
01:04:12,028 --> 01:04:16,792
he claimed it was. And he was like, yeah, just
take my Mind Stone. Ripped my brain out. That's

743
01:04:16,812 --> 01:04:22,476
pretty hardcore. As hardcore as I wanted a Marvel
zombie story to be. So I was really glad to

744
01:04:22,496 --> 01:04:27,461
see this one. I'm not sure if the whole Thanos
lying in wait and what kind of thing made sense.

745
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:32,805
No, it didn't. It was what it was. They needed
some kind of ending like that. Yeah, they were

746
01:04:32,825 --> 01:04:37,849
taking the Mind Stone right to him. So what's
worse than Thanos? Zombie Thanos with the Infinity

747
01:04:37,889 --> 01:04:41,667
Gauntlet. But overall I do think that this was
a fun episode, I gave it 4 stars out of 5.

748
01:04:41,907 --> 01:04:45,449
It was pretty much exactly what I wanted it
to be. I didn't think I liked this episode,

749
01:04:45,469 --> 01:04:49,350
but just talking about it made me realize that
yeah this was a good episode, one of the better

750
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:55,613
ones I think. I'll give this like 4 stars. Episode
6 was called What If Killmonger Rescued Tony

751
01:04:55,653 --> 01:05:00,555
Stark? It stars Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger,
Jon Favreau as Happy Hogan, Chadwick Boseman

752
01:05:00,595 --> 01:05:05,857
as Black Panther, Angela Bassett as Ramonda,
Danai Gurira as Okoye, Andy Serkis as Klawe,

753
01:05:06,198 --> 01:05:10,919
Don Cheadle as War Machine, Paul Bettany as
Jarvis, and Mick Winger again as Tony Stark.

754
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:16,042
In it, Killmonger saves Tony Stark from being
taken by the Ten Rings and reveals Obadiah

755
01:05:16,062 --> 01:05:21,564
Stane's involvement in the abduction plot. Tony
takes Killmonger in as a confidant and helps

756
01:05:21,604 --> 01:05:27,346
him build a humanoid combat drone out of vibranium.
Killmonger manipulates Tony Stark into arranging

757
01:05:27,486 --> 01:05:33,509
a vibranium purchase by War Machine from Ulysses
Claw. Killmonger kills War Machine and Black

758
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:38,612
Panther who shows up to stop the deal. He also
kills Stark, who confronts him regarding his

759
01:05:38,652 --> 01:05:44,456
manipulation, making it all look like a Wakandan
attack. Killmonger travels to Wakanda and helps

760
01:05:44,476 --> 01:05:50,561
them fend off the US retaliation, gaining their
trust and becoming the new Black Panther. Shuri

761
01:05:50,601 --> 01:05:56,385
visits Pepper Potts, who both distrust Killmonger
and propose an alliance to stop him. Now this

762
01:05:56,445 --> 01:06:00,608
episode was called What If Killmonger Rescued
Tony Stark, but what it should have been called

763
01:06:00,668 --> 01:06:06,372
was What If Killmonger... went about his plan
from the Black Panther movie in a more convoluted

764
01:06:06,412 --> 01:06:11,677
and more boring way. That's what I was gonna
say. I was like, this whole thing was so convoluted,

765
01:06:11,997 --> 01:06:16,901
way more convoluted than it needed to be. He
was almost like a double agent against himself.

766
01:06:17,241 --> 01:06:22,465
It was weird. It was strange, especially the
way it ended. I kind of figured that maybe

767
01:06:22,505 --> 01:06:27,549
he was going to fulfill his goal and then realize
the evilness of his actions or something, learn

768
01:06:27,569 --> 01:06:31,993
some kind of profound lesson through it all
about maybe family or something like that.

769
01:06:32,774 --> 01:06:37,277
He never got his comeuppance. It ended on a
cliffhanger, which I didn't know why at the

770
01:06:37,297 --> 01:06:41,760
time. We learned later that, you know, he kind
of needs to remain the bad guy. But as a whole,

771
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:46,043
this episode just didn't work. Well, yeah, like
Killmonger when the Black Panther movie came

772
01:06:46,083 --> 01:06:51,626
out, he was such like a fan favorite character.
Like people really liked Michael B. Jordan

773
01:06:51,746 --> 01:06:56,109
as the character. So I'm with you. I also thought
that he was going to have like some kind of

774
01:06:56,189 --> 01:07:01,413
turn in the story where he became a good guy,
you know, when the episode ended on that really

775
01:07:01,453 --> 01:07:08,041
weird cliffhanger. I was also like, what the
fuck was this episode? It was not a good episode.

776
01:07:08,461 --> 01:07:13,264
Yeah, I give it two and a half stars out of
five. I would give it like two stars, maybe

777
01:07:13,344 --> 01:07:18,387
one and a half. The next episode, episode seven,
was called What If Thor Were an Only Child?

778
01:07:18,747 --> 01:07:23,830
It stars Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Natalie Portman
as Jane Foster, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, Kat

779
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:29,833
Dennings as Darcy Lewis, Jeff Goldblum as the
Grandmaster, Taika Waititi as Korg, Jamie Alexander

780
01:07:29,853 --> 01:07:34,867
as Sif. and Alexandra Daniels as Captain Marvel.
Brie Larson didn't contribute to this one.

781
01:07:35,267 --> 01:07:40,230
The story goes, when Odin neglects to adopt
Loki as his own after the war with the Frost

782
01:07:40,270 --> 01:07:45,912
Giants, Thor grows up an only child, craving
attention through hard partying. When his father

783
01:07:45,992 --> 01:07:51,594
enters the Odin's sleep, Thor travels to Earth
to throw a party, his arrival detected by Jane

784
01:07:51,614 --> 01:07:56,556
Foster. Thor and Jane fall in love, though the
party's craziness threatens the planet.

785
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:05,425
and she and Thor fight. Jane reaches out to
Friggo with Heimdall's help, and Thor scrambles

786
01:08:05,445 --> 01:08:10,908
to clean up the planet before his mother arrives.
They're successful, though as Thor asks Jane

787
01:08:11,088 --> 01:08:16,050
out, they're interrupted by a variant of Ultron
invading the universe and wielding the Infinity

788
01:08:16,091 --> 01:08:22,814
Stones. This episode was fucking dumb. Like,
it was my least favorite episode. Really? Yes.

789
01:08:22,954 --> 01:08:26,696
I didn't think it was too bad. I thought it
was funny. The whole thing was just played

790
01:08:26,736 --> 01:08:33,213
for laughs. They, like, traded every character.
as a joke from Loki to Jane to Frigga. Well,

791
01:08:33,233 --> 01:08:37,936
this was like the comedy episode. It was kind
of like a riff on party movies, you know, where

792
01:08:37,956 --> 01:08:41,059
like the teen throws the big party and then
has to clean up before the parents get home.

793
01:08:41,339 --> 01:08:46,102
Who the hell cares? Like, why was that one of
the story ideas that came up in the writer's

794
01:08:46,142 --> 01:08:49,825
room? Like, you know what would be funny? If
like Thor was like a frat bro. It's like, ugh.

795
01:08:51,646 --> 01:08:55,942
Yeah, I mean, there's not too much substance
here. I think there is a lot of charm. And

796
01:08:56,002 --> 01:09:00,403
I do think that the fight between Thor and Captain
Marvel was pretty epic. I thought that was

797
01:09:00,443 --> 01:09:05,424
done really well. But yeah, I mean, there was
not really a huge plot, largely a vehicle,

798
01:09:05,464 --> 01:09:10,485
I think, for Chris Hemsworth to be funny. Yeah.
Yeah, that's exactly what it was. And of all

799
01:09:10,565 --> 01:09:15,367
the different episodes that we got here, this
was the one I was least interested in, like

800
01:09:15,427 --> 01:09:19,848
learning the whole what if story behind. It
was so pointless. Well, what did you think

801
01:09:19,868 --> 01:09:23,889
about Thor and Loki's relationship in this?
How despite the fact that they weren't brothers,

802
01:09:24,149 --> 01:09:29,096
they still called each other brothers. Brothers
from another mother? Yeah. Loki is more interesting

803
01:09:29,156 --> 01:09:34,560
as Thor's brother, not as a frost giant. Not
as his bro? I think so. What did you think

804
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:39,703
when you saw Infinity Stone Ultron come through
at the end? I thought, oh they found a way

805
01:09:39,743 --> 01:09:43,266
to tie all these stories together. Because I
knew that the next story was going to be, you

806
01:09:43,286 --> 01:09:49,290
know, what if Ultron won? Overall I give episode
7, What if Thor Were an Only Child, a 3.5 out

807
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:55,386
of 10. What? This one gets like a 0.5 for me.
This was pointless. It would get a point five

808
01:09:55,446 --> 01:10:01,211
if it was drawn in crayon and was spoken in
gibberish. Fine. A one. Episode eight was called

809
01:10:01,392 --> 01:10:07,277
What If Ultron Won? It stars Jeremy Renner as
Hawkeye, Lake Bell as Black Widow, Toby Jones

810
01:10:07,297 --> 01:10:13,662
as Arnim Zola and Ross Markand as Ultron. I
don't think Ross did as good of an impression

811
01:10:13,702 --> 01:10:19,507
of James Spader as he does of Hugo Weaving as
Red Skull. To me, Ultron's voice took me out

812
01:10:19,547 --> 01:10:24,671
of this a little bit. I thought he did a decent
impression. In the story, Ultron assumes his

813
01:10:24,751 --> 01:10:30,476
Vision form and defeats the Avengers, unleashing
a nuclear holocaust on the planet. He kills

814
01:10:30,556 --> 01:10:35,961
Thanos upon his arrival and acquires the other
Infinity Stones. Which was dumb! Oh man, we'll

815
01:10:36,061 --> 01:10:41,706
talk all about that. Alright. With the stones,
Ultron wipes out nearly all life in the universe,

816
01:10:41,826 --> 01:10:46,950
except for Hawkeye and Black Widow who plot
to defeat him using Arnim Zola's analog artificial

817
01:10:46,990 --> 01:10:52,030
intelligence. They arm one of Hawkeye's arrows
with their upload device, But Ultron evades

818
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:57,231
defeat by leaving his universe after becoming
aware of the Watcher's presence. He attacks

819
01:10:57,271 --> 01:11:02,273
the Watcher and begins destroying other realities.
The Watcher approaches Doctor Strange Supreme

820
01:11:02,533 --> 01:11:07,514
and asks for his help in forming a team to stop
Ultron. So let's talk about Ultron killing

821
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:14,196
Thanos so easily. The vision from Infinity War
has really got to be kicking himself. If he

822
01:11:14,236 --> 01:11:18,837
knew that's all he had to do to defeat Thanos
when he arrived in Wakanda, then the Avengers

823
01:11:18,857 --> 01:11:24,557
would have won easily. Tony would have even
had to die. Like Tony's death is on Vision.

824
01:11:24,898 --> 01:11:28,801
Exactly. You know, I bet you even Scarlet Witch
would have been able to do that. Like in Vision

825
01:11:28,841 --> 01:11:32,405
and Scarlet Witch together, like when Thanos
was approaching, they should have just been

826
01:11:32,625 --> 01:11:37,729
slicing him in half. They really turned Thanos
into a bitch in these episodes. That's what

827
01:11:37,769 --> 01:11:42,654
I'm saying. That should have been an epic battle,
but maybe they were too cheap. Maybe they ran

828
01:11:42,694 --> 01:11:47,590
out of time to animate that. They just needed
to get the story moving, I guess. but my jaw

829
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:53,672
like physically dropped when Ultron killed Thanos
and I was just like, what the fuck? Okay. But

830
01:11:53,732 --> 01:11:59,014
I did like the rest of the episode. I especially
liked how they handled Hawkeye here. He was

831
01:11:59,115 --> 01:12:03,376
such a fucking badass. Like they need to do
more of that shit within the live action stuff.

832
01:12:03,636 --> 01:12:07,698
Oh right. With Jeremy Renner. The fact that
he was like firing three arrows at a time and

833
01:12:07,718 --> 01:12:12,540
hitting his marks, all the different trick arrows
that he had. He seems like such a powerhouse,

834
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:18,166
which is what Hawkeye is. Anyone who hates Hawkeye.
doesn't realize that he could go up against

835
01:12:18,206 --> 01:12:23,008
freaking anybody with his trick arrows. He has
an arrow for every occasion. Let's hope we

836
01:12:23,028 --> 01:12:28,129
see some of this in the Hawkeye TV show. Yes,
we need to see that. We need to see him sniping

837
01:12:28,149 --> 01:12:33,311
people without even being seen, doing some serious
damage with some like explosive arrows or some

838
01:12:33,371 --> 01:12:38,332
shit. And just like being this real wild card
that can hit you no matter what. He was definitely

839
01:12:38,372 --> 01:12:43,834
the coolest he's ever been in the MCU in this
episode. Yeah. And I appreciated that. And

840
01:12:43,894 --> 01:12:48,798
I also thought that their plan to defeat Ultron,
given that he's, you know, a digital artificial

841
01:12:48,838 --> 01:12:54,943
intelligence was pretty clever. Yeah, he's all
powerful, but unlike Thanos, he's not an actual

842
01:12:55,243 --> 01:13:00,528
organic being, meaning that no matter how powerful
he gets, he's still susceptible to the failings

843
01:13:00,568 --> 01:13:04,811
of all technology. Did it make sense though
that they could upload, you know, an analog

844
01:13:04,991 --> 01:13:12,197
AI to a USB drive? Yeah. Oh, okay. It must've
been some kind of like magnetic tape type upload.

845
01:13:12,482 --> 01:13:16,885
device thing or something. I don't know. I was
just wondering like what made Arnim Zola so

846
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:23,049
much more powerful than Ultron? I wouldn't say
he was a more powerful form of technology,

847
01:13:23,209 --> 01:13:27,732
but just as powerful of a mind, which I think
in its analog form would have taken Ultron

848
01:13:27,772 --> 01:13:32,176
by surprise. Especially considering that it
seemed Ultron didn't really know how to use

849
01:13:32,216 --> 01:13:37,599
the stones to their full extent, as we'll discuss
in the next episode. Overall, I give What If

850
01:13:37,659 --> 01:13:43,384
Ultron Won four stars out of five, mainly because...
I like seeing Hawkeye in action. I really thought

851
01:13:43,444 --> 01:13:47,827
the fight between Ultron and the Watcher was
cool. Yeah, I would agree. Four stars make

852
01:13:47,847 --> 01:13:53,332
sense. The last episode, episode nine, was called
What If the Watcher Broke His Oath? It stars

853
01:13:53,372 --> 01:13:57,655
Hailey Atwell as Captain Carter, Lake Bell as
Black Widow, Chadwick Boseman as Star-Lord,

854
01:13:57,896 --> 01:14:02,419
Michael B. Jordan as Killmonger, Chris Hemsworth
as Thor, Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange

855
01:14:02,439 --> 01:14:07,979
Supreme, and Cynthia McWilliams as Gamora. Gamora
was a surprise in this episode. I thought I

856
01:14:08,019 --> 01:14:13,362
had actually skipped an episode. Same. But what
really happened was that this season was supposed

857
01:14:13,382 --> 01:14:18,065
to be 10 episodes. They couldn't finish the
10th one in time due to COVID. So what they're

858
01:14:18,085 --> 01:14:24,248
gonna do is they're gonna put the episode where
Gamora defeats Thanos into season two. In this

859
01:14:24,288 --> 01:14:29,391
episode, the Watcher and Dr. Strange Supreme
recruit Captain Carter, Star-Lord, Killmonger,

860
01:14:29,531 --> 01:14:34,918
Party Thor, and Gamora into a guardians of the
multiverse team to stop Ultron. They plan to

861
01:14:35,058 --> 01:14:39,939
use Gamora's Infinity Stone Crusher device to
defeat him, though it needs to be powered by

862
01:14:39,979 --> 01:14:45,461
the Soul Stone. The team confronts Ultron and
they fight, joined at one point by Zombie Scarlet

863
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:50,862
Witch. Star-Lord swipes one of the stones, but
Gamora's device fails since it can only destroy

864
01:14:51,002 --> 01:14:57,244
her universe's stones. Black Widow fires the
Arnim Zola arrow, which takes over and seemingly

865
01:14:57,284 --> 01:15:02,485
defeats Ultron. Killmonger then takes control
of the stones, though Arnim Zola fights him

866
01:15:02,505 --> 01:15:07,961
for them. With the stones in between ownership,
the Watcher seals them in a pocket dimension.

867
01:15:08,241 --> 01:15:12,684
The Guardians are returned to their respective
universes, though Black Widow is taken to the

868
01:15:12,745 --> 01:15:17,148
universe where Hank Pym killed the Avengers
so that she can help stop Loki's invasion.

869
01:15:17,488 --> 01:15:23,212
Back home, Captain Carter discovers the hydrostomper
with someone inside. Oh, I think I missed that.

870
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:27,743
Was that an after credit scene? Yes. Captain
Carter lands back on the Lemurian Star where

871
01:15:27,763 --> 01:15:32,244
she's fighting Batroc, and they find out that
the mysterious cargo the ship is holding is

872
01:15:32,404 --> 01:15:37,106
Hydra Stopper, allegedly with Steve Rogers inside.
All right, dang it, I have to go see that now.

873
01:15:37,467 --> 01:15:40,828
Yeah, I assume that's gonna play into season
two, because I think Captain Carter's going

874
01:15:40,868 --> 01:15:45,390
to be a mainstay character throughout each of
these what-if seasons. Overall, I liked the

875
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:49,972
action in this episode, but some of the plot
seemed a little bit questionable, like the

876
01:15:50,012 --> 01:15:55,942
whole needing the Soul Stone to power the Infinity
Gem Destroyer. that didn't even work? Right.

877
01:15:56,243 --> 01:16:01,806
Yeah, because all of a sudden they're like,
oh, it must only work for my universe's stones,

878
01:16:02,126 --> 01:16:07,849
which is stupid and also highlights another
complaint I have in that it's comic book canon

879
01:16:08,049 --> 01:16:13,492
that the Infinity Stones only affect the universe
that they originate from. That's what I was

880
01:16:13,532 --> 01:16:17,834
thinking. Like, didn't they establish that in
Loki? Yeah, that's what I thought. Outside

881
01:16:17,854 --> 01:16:22,517
of the time stream when Ultron was fighting
the Watcher, he shouldn't have been able to

882
01:16:22,657 --> 01:16:26,796
use the stones. Yeah, they would have just been
paperweights and then Watcher would have wiped

883
01:16:26,836 --> 01:16:31,519
his ass with Ultron. So they're kind of going
against their own canon as it were regarding

884
01:16:31,559 --> 01:16:36,082
the stones, which is also different from the
canon from the comic books. So it's a little

885
01:16:36,102 --> 01:16:40,285
bit hard to understand. Especially considering
that the stones could be used in other universes,

886
01:16:40,565 --> 01:16:45,569
just not destroyed in other universes. I don't
know if I'm being nitpicky, but I don't know.

887
01:16:45,729 --> 01:16:50,952
I didn't buy it. One thing I didn't get was
that the Watcher and Dark Doctor Strange said

888
01:16:50,992 --> 01:16:55,239
that they put this team together because they
each had like specific traits that they would

889
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:59,401
need to defeat Ultron. And like, why the hell
would you put Killmonger on the team? Like,

890
01:16:59,421 --> 01:17:04,904
what did he contribute other than turning evil?
Well, the Watcher knew that he would betray

891
01:17:04,944 --> 01:17:10,147
the team and ultimately he needed Killmonger
to do that, to wrest control of the Infinity

892
01:17:10,187 --> 01:17:14,650
Gems from Ultron. And during that transition
point is when the Watcher had already planned

893
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:20,193
to seal them in the Pocket Dimension. Really?
Yes. Okay, that's convenient. He's the Watcher,

894
01:17:20,373 --> 01:17:24,255
he sees everything. One of my favorite moments
from this episode was actually seeing Dark

895
01:17:24,295 --> 01:17:29,538
Doctor Strange go up against Infinity Gem Ultron.
I think that was probably the highlight of

896
01:17:29,718 --> 01:17:34,181
maybe the entire series. Just seeing these like
two powerhouses go at it. Yeah, yeah, that

897
01:17:34,201 --> 01:17:38,884
was really well done. The main purpose of this
episode was to spotlight that action between

898
01:17:38,924 --> 01:17:44,508
the Guardians and Ultron wielding the Infinity
Stones. What kind of annoyed me was that Ultron

899
01:17:44,648 --> 01:17:50,503
wielded the stones in a very inefficient way.
Kind of like how the Hood did in the comics.

900
01:17:50,523 --> 01:17:54,904
Like he didn't realize that he had unlimited
power with them and that he could do anything.

901
01:17:54,964 --> 01:18:00,387
He could just will them out of existence instead
of fighting them. Right, like why go to alternate

902
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:04,629
universes and take them over with robots when
he could just snap everything out of existence?

903
01:18:04,909 --> 01:18:09,831
Yeah, he's taking too much of a warrior's approach,
which seems a little off for an artificial

904
01:18:09,871 --> 01:18:13,632
intelligence character. You'd think he'd take
the most logically efficient route and just

905
01:18:13,672 --> 01:18:19,672
snap everything away, including the Guardians
of the Multiverse. Tom, zero stars. No, overall,

906
01:18:19,932 --> 01:18:24,255
I thought the action really salvaged this episode
despite some of the questionable plot points.

907
01:18:24,715 --> 01:18:28,738
I give this one three stars out of five. Yeah,
I'll probably give it three as well. The action

908
01:18:28,898 --> 01:18:32,921
was pretty cool. And I just really liked Uwatu
in this episode. Like whenever the watcher

909
01:18:32,981 --> 01:18:37,644
gets involved, I think it's just awesome for
some reason. He's not supposed to, but he does

910
01:18:37,724 --> 01:18:43,648
it and it's always interesting. Yeah, I totally
agree. Overall, like when averaging the scores

911
01:18:43,668 --> 01:18:50,154
that I gave each episode, and factoring in the
whole point about how the concept of the series

912
01:18:50,234 --> 01:18:54,877
has it going against itself, but also figuring
the potential that the series could have in

913
01:18:54,917 --> 01:19:01,363
the future. Overall, I give season 1 of What
If 3 stars out of 5. I'll always appreciate

914
01:19:01,543 --> 01:19:06,967
What If for its novelty, but in a multiverse
where anything is possible, nothing matters.

915
01:19:07,328 --> 01:19:13,633
So to make audiences care, they have to do even
better with their stories. Otherwise the show

916
01:19:13,653 --> 01:19:21,108
may as well be called But why? Which is really
how I felt with some of these episodes. Absolutely.

917
01:19:21,448 --> 01:19:28,491
Or like, what the fuck? I think Three Stars
is pretty fair. Like you mentioned earlier,

918
01:19:28,872 --> 01:19:34,254
each episode was hit or miss. The hits were
pretty awesome. The misses were fucking awful.

919
01:19:34,274 --> 01:19:39,776
It's like, why does this even exist? So like
almost straight in the middle, Three Stars

920
01:19:39,936 --> 01:19:44,551
is a good rating. It's not horrible, it's passing.

929
01:20:32,773 --> 01:20:37,757
I'm really looking forward to this probably
more than any other DC animated movie that

930
01:20:37,797 --> 01:20:43,531
I've heard announced. So I probably have to
check my expectations, but I expect good things.

931
01:20:43,931 --> 01:20:48,472
We're really looking forward to it, especially
after the opening scene that we got to see

932
01:20:48,512 --> 01:20:53,293
during the DC fandom. That was really cool.
It's like straight from the comic. I can't

933
01:20:53,313 --> 01:20:56,955
wait to see this movie. But that does it for
this episode. We want to give a big thanks
