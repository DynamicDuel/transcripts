00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:25,018 --> 00:00:30,299
Welcome to the dynamic duel podcast a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:36,061
the superiority between Marvel and DC By comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations

4
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:42,922
I'm Johnny DC and I'm his twin brother Marvelous
Joe and in this episode for Halloween We are

5
00:00:42,962 --> 00:00:50,184
reviewing the not scary at all vampire film
Blade Trinity Yeah, this is part of our spooky

6
00:00:50,244 --> 00:00:56,486
October. We'll call it spooktober series of
episodes this month culminating in one of the

7
00:00:56,706 --> 00:01:02,268
biggest surprise I'm sure listeners will receive
from this podcast ever. It's gonna be huge.

8
00:01:02,508 --> 00:01:07,329
You guys are gonna love it. Be sure to tune
in on Halloween day for an episode that's gonna

9
00:01:07,369 --> 00:01:11,890
blow your socks off. The executive producers
know what we're talking about, but the rest

10
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,451
of you are just gonna have to wait to find out
later. Yeah, it's gonna be super fun. Of course,

11
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:21,633
this episode is a tie-in to last week's episode
in which we did a duel between the vampire

12
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:30,876
and Dracula, Dracula being the main antagonist
of Blade Trinity. Barely. I mean, barely, right?

13
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:35,660
Like, we'll talk about that later as we discuss
the film in our review. Right. Before that,

14
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,624
we're going to break down the comic book movie
news from the past week of which there was

15
00:01:39,704 --> 00:01:43,887
really nothing. We're going to be talking about
video game news in this episode, because later

16
00:01:43,927 --> 00:01:50,093
on in this month, Spider-Man 2 for the PlayStation
5 is dropping. It's a big deal for all the

17
00:01:50,113 --> 00:01:54,524
video game people. So we're going to talk about
the latest trailer for the game. As always,

you want to skip ahead to a particular topic.
As our listeners may know, our dual simulator

20
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:08,034
is so advanced that it's gained sentience and
has named itself the artificial life form for

21
00:02:08,094 --> 00:02:14,098
running extensive duels. Just a rather very
intelligent simulator. Nine thousand or Alfred

41
00:04:15,484 --> 00:04:16,325
to the no prize.

42
00:04:20,322 --> 00:04:25,205
A No Prize is an award Marvel used to give out
to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Dual No Prize,

43
00:04:25,505 --> 00:04:29,988
is a digital award we post on Instagram and
in our email newsletter for the person that

44
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:35,332
we feel gave the best answer to our question
of the week. Last week, we asked, which prior

45
00:04:35,392 --> 00:04:41,537
DC film or television series would you most
hope remained in James Gunn's DCU continuity

46
00:04:41,977 --> 00:04:47,301
and why? Of course, this was coming off of the
news that James Gunn had said that Viola Davis,

47
00:04:48,534 --> 00:04:54,695
and Shalomaritwanya were maintaining their roles
in his new DC universe. Yeah, we wanted to

48
00:04:54,715 --> 00:04:58,617
know what else you guys wanted to survive the
transition. Got some great answers, got a lot

49
00:04:58,657 --> 00:05:02,958
of answers. So let's go ahead and break down
our honorable mentions and the no prize winner.

50
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:09,180
Our first honorable mention goes to Unworthy
Collector from Instagram who said, Hey guys,

51
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,401
it's Unworthy. First of all, my cousin Andrew
Bennett was not impressed with Joe's nonsense

52
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:21,484
last week. But as far as DC shows that I'd like
to see continue in James Gunn's universe, I'd

53
00:05:21,524 --> 00:05:27,370
really like to see them retool the Titans characters
from the show and include Ray Fisher's cyborg.

54
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:32,795
Because I really think what the DC universe
is going to need moving forward is definitely

55
00:05:32,835 --> 00:05:37,640
a Titans team. Right, of course, the Titans
was a series that premiered on Max. They went

56
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,893
through four seasons. Not a bad show, actually
a pretty good show that felt like it fit right

57
00:05:43,013 --> 00:05:47,837
in with the Snyderverse. Cyborg of course was
a character that's in the Doom Patrol television

58
00:05:47,878 --> 00:05:52,382
series, but I think he makes more sense as a
part of the Titans, and I would love for him

59
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:57,987
to be a part of that in a new DC universe. Well,
Unworthy mentioned specifically Ray Fisher,

60
00:05:58,087 --> 00:06:03,352
who played Cyborg in the Justice League film.
Yeah, that guy's career is probably not going

61
00:06:03,372 --> 00:06:07,094
to continue with any Warner Brothers project.
So I guess we'll have to settle for Joyvon

62
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:11,537
Wade. Which, that's not really settling in my
opinion. You know, I think he does a great

63
00:06:11,577 --> 00:06:15,819
job with the character. How important do you
think it is to have a successful Titans team

64
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:21,222
within a DC cinematic universe? Well, you know,
it seems like since they're starting off with

65
00:06:21,383 --> 00:06:28,146
a film literally called Superman Legacy, that
legacy itself will be a major component of

66
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:32,629
this new cinematic universe that James Gunn
is establishing. You know, you could also look

67
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:39,115
at projects. like Paradise Lost and maybe exploring
Hippolyta and you know even Batman and Robin,

68
00:06:39,235 --> 00:06:44,316
they're brave in the bold film to see how legacy
will play a role. I think the Titans will be

69
00:06:44,376 --> 00:06:49,638
huge in this upcoming universe. I hope they
are at least. Yeah, totally makes sense thematically

70
00:06:49,678 --> 00:06:54,359
with the direction that Guns Universe seems
to be headed. So great answer Unworthy. Shout

71
00:06:54,379 --> 00:07:00,821
out to your cousin, Andrew Bennett, who works
at the H&R Block as an accountant. Our next

72
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:08,058
honorable mention goes to... Colby Hentges who
said, Hey boys, Colby Hentges. If James Gunn

73
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:14,482
keeps one DC show, I want it to be why the last
man. I know the show didn't get off to a great

74
00:07:14,542 --> 00:07:18,505
start, but if it's anything like the books,
they just get better and better every issue

75
00:07:19,086 --> 00:07:25,531
and the supporting cast on the show was fantastic.
Agent three 55 and Dr. Mann were great. Diane

76
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:31,770
Lane is his mom was awesome. I'd like to see
it get a better shot. So I did not watch the

77
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:37,713
Why the Last Man television series. It was on
FX and I just didn't have access to that. But

78
00:07:37,793 --> 00:07:43,816
I am a huge fan of the comic book series, Why
the Last Man. And everything I saw from the

79
00:07:43,876 --> 00:07:49,258
trailers made it look like the television series
was not a terrible adaptation. And I was really

80
00:07:49,298 --> 00:07:53,580
heartbroken to hear it was canceled because
I would have loved to have seen that whole

81
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:58,951
series go to the very end, which is a really
powerful ending. So yeah, if James Gunn can

82
00:07:59,171 --> 00:08:04,614
somehow revive that show, I definitely think
that's within his power as one of the CEOs

83
00:08:04,654 --> 00:08:10,898
for DC Studios, that would be awesome. Well,
Why the Last Man is published by DC's imprint

84
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:17,002
Vertigo, but it's not part of any DC universe,
you know? So I don't see it joining James Gunn's

85
00:08:17,022 --> 00:08:22,045
DCU at all. Well, no, I don't think it needs
to be a part of the DCU. It's just a story

86
00:08:22,065 --> 00:08:27,240
that came from the publisher. that I think would
be great to see continued in live action. Oh,

87
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,244
gotcha. Yeah, we didn't review Why the Last
Man, but we also didn't review Sweet Tooth

88
00:08:32,284 --> 00:08:36,547
as well, largely because we like to stick in
the superhero genre when it comes to the stories

89
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:40,990
that these publishers put out there. Right,
it's the same reason we didn't review The Kitchen.

90
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:48,195
Right. Great answer, Colby. Our next honorable
mention goes to Marquis High. I would have

91
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:54,287
to go with my man Ben this time, and I'm sorry,
I- I felt it so much that I forgot to throw

92
00:08:54,327 --> 00:09:02,754
my name in. This is Mark C, Mark C1684. Just
calling into you gentlemen. Ben Affleck reads

93
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:06,958
the comics. He's been a part of the material.
He loves the stuff. And I thought he was a

94
00:09:06,998 --> 00:09:14,224
good Batman. Yay, picked up a gun and killed
some people. But you know, sometimes. Thanks

95
00:09:14,264 --> 00:09:19,468
guys. Have a good one. Yes, sometimes Batman
just has to pick up a gun and kill some people.

96
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:24,764
That's what I've always said. I mean that happened
in the nightmare vision, you know, it's not

97
00:09:24,784 --> 00:09:30,970
like Batman and the prime timeline was just
cap and fools. But no, I love Ben Affleck as

98
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:36,835
Batman. And I know he says that he's done with
the role. But considering the first project

99
00:09:36,855 --> 00:09:42,300
we may see him in is this Brave and the Bold
Batman and Robin movie, it makes sense that

100
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:48,574
they would go with a Batman that's, you know,
maybe in his 50s like Ben Affleck is. Yeah,

101
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:54,057
established and totally believable as a father
figure to a young Robin. Like, I don't think

102
00:09:54,077 --> 00:10:00,660
you could have Robert Pattinson be a part of
the DCU having a kid in his second onscreen

103
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,943
appearance, you know? It would have to be like
a baby for it to work. Yeah. So it really seems

104
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:12,347
like the Batman franchise directed by Matt Reeves
will definitely not be part of the DCU. With

105
00:10:12,387 --> 00:10:16,209
the direction, it sounds like James Gunn is
taking his universe and it does not sound like

106
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:20,560
that as much as I would love. for the Batman
to be a part of that. I don't think it's gonna

107
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,624
happen. So why not keep Ben Affleck? I would
not hate it. Great answer, Markey. Hi, we wanna

108
00:10:26,644 --> 00:10:32,809
give a quick shout out to the other answerers,
Abner O'Terry, Christopher Manati, Micky Mathengian,

109
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:38,233
and Travis Herndon for taking the time to visit
our website and record your answer. But the

110
00:10:38,273 --> 00:10:45,626
winner of this week's No Prize is Lizzie Dyer
Arnie, who said, Hey, it's Lizzie. I definitely

111
00:10:45,706 --> 00:10:51,511
want Black Adam to remain in the James Gunn
continuity because it introduced the Justice

112
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:58,135
Society of America. Now they're the very first
OG superhero team. I think they're very important

113
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:04,861
to the DC universe and I would like to see some
older heroes trying to save the day. It'd be

114
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:10,265
a lot of fun. So with the exception of Henry
Cavill's cameo in the post-credits scene at

115
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:17,410
the end of Black The movie overall was pretty
removed from the larger DCEU. Viola Davis's

116
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:21,854
Amanda Waller notwithstanding, but she's gonna
continue into the DCEU anyway, so it doesn't

117
00:11:21,874 --> 00:11:26,798
matter. We're getting JSA characters in Superman
Legacy, we know. We're getting Hawkeye Girl

118
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:30,981
and Mr. Terrific, who weren't seen in Black
Adam. So I still think that they could all

119
00:11:31,001 --> 00:11:36,990
be a part of the same JSA team together. So
yeah, I would love it if Black Adam. was still

120
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:41,773
a part of the new universe's continuity. I don't
see a reason why that wouldn't be the case.

121
00:11:42,314 --> 00:11:46,197
Yeah, it would be cool to see all this Hodge
again as Hawkman. Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure

122
00:11:46,217 --> 00:11:51,221
if there's any bad blood between James Gunn
and the Rock, considering that James Gunn kind

123
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:55,484
of took over the universe when the Rock wanted
to shepherd that role. But I would love to

124
00:11:55,504 --> 00:12:00,188
see the Rock return as Black Adam, regardless.
Yeah, we spoke earlier about the theme of legacy

125
00:12:00,248 --> 00:12:06,459
regarding the Titans superhero team. JSA is
also all about legacy, probably even more so

126
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:11,881
than the Titans because JSA actually spans multiple
generations of heroes. So, you know in keeping

127
00:12:11,901 --> 00:12:18,284
with that theme, I think JSA absolutely should
have an important role within James Gunn's

128
00:12:18,324 --> 00:12:24,186
DCU. Yeah, 100% and the JSA was one of the coolest
aspects of the Black Adam movie. So I would

129
00:12:24,206 --> 00:12:28,588
love to see all of those characters return.
Great answer Lizzie, you win this week's No

130
00:12:28,628 --> 00:12:32,828
Prize. If you're the listener want a shot at
winning your own No Prize. Stay tuned till

131
00:12:32,848 --> 00:12:38,005
later on in this episode when we'll ask another
question of the week. And now that that's done,

132
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:38,828
on to the news!

133
00:12:44,482 --> 00:12:48,645
Alright this past week we got a new trailer
for Marvel's Spider-Man 2 video game that's

134
00:12:48,665 --> 00:12:53,810
gonna come out exclusively on the PS5. In just
a few weeks, on October 20th, the trailer was

135
00:12:53,850 --> 00:13:00,056
called B-Grader Together and it shows Peter
Parker's Spider-Man fighting alongside Miles

136
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:06,041
Morales' Spider-Man against the villain Venom.
And the game looks incredible. You know, it

137
00:13:06,061 --> 00:13:09,624
looks like both characters are dealing with
their own drama and stuff like that, but they

138
00:13:09,704 --> 00:13:15,149
both, by the end... have this resolve of being
Spider-Man and they take on Venom and the graphics

139
00:13:15,189 --> 00:13:20,473
look incredible. We know that gameplay is going
to be split up between the two characters and

140
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:25,678
offer very different feels to the gameplay where
Miles Morales has the powers of the Venom Blast

141
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:31,623
and invisibility, whereas Spider-Man will not
only have the symbiote powers for some parts

142
00:13:31,663 --> 00:13:36,787
of the game, but this trailer also reveals that
he'll also have the Iron Spider or Superior

143
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:41,623
Spider-Man mechanical arms that come out of
his back. So it looks like it's adding a whole

144
00:13:41,663 --> 00:13:46,247
lot more dynamics to the Spider-Man game that
initially came out with the last generation,

145
00:13:46,828 --> 00:13:51,632
widely acclaimed as one of the best, if not
the best, superhero video game of all time.

146
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:56,836
I know Jonathan disputes that with the Arkham
video games, but he's wrong. The best superhero

147
00:13:56,857 --> 00:14:01,921
video game is actually Spider-Man for the PS4.
I mean, I've played the Arkham games, so that's

148
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:07,354
just, you know, for my opinion. But no, I hear
great things about the Spider-Man game. And

149
00:14:07,474 --> 00:14:14,756
I've played some amazing Spider-Man games in
my time. So I don't not believe it. Of course,

150
00:14:15,316 --> 00:14:21,138
Jonathan and I aren't huge gamers. We used to
be, but kind of fell out of that when I stopped

151
00:14:21,178 --> 00:14:25,999
buying the current consoles. Like, I don't have
a PS5, which is devastating to me when I look

152
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:31,180
at how cool this game is. I have not played
the PS4 Spider-Man game, and I do want to get

153
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,630
to that. I do have a PS4. I should probably
get the game. What the hell am I doing? Well,

154
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:41,273
I don't know you had a PS4. Yeah. Well, my wife
does. Yeah, she bought the Harry Potter game.

155
00:14:42,473 --> 00:14:45,995
She's probably more of a gamer than I am. It's
like it's really hard for me to find the time.

156
00:14:46,355 --> 00:14:53,659
I sound like a total lame ass right now. Yeah,
it sounds like excuses. But, you know, it's

157
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:59,202
hard to find time to play the games when you
have a podcast. Again, excuses. I would find

158
00:14:59,222 --> 00:15:06,066
the time. Yeah, I definitely should. Because
I'm sick. I can't go into work today. or tomorrow,

159
00:15:06,787 --> 00:15:10,749
play it straight all the way through. I really
hope no one from my work is listening to this

160
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:14,932
because I've never done that. And well, the
Batman Arkham games are coming out for the

161
00:15:14,992 --> 00:15:19,355
switch later. Jonathan, you have a switch. Are
you going to get those games? Oh, absolutely.

162
00:15:19,395 --> 00:15:24,179
I mean, I'm really sad that the release date
for that got delayed from this month, October

163
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:29,342
to December, because I was ready to play it.
Like so ready. But, you know, I've also already

164
00:15:29,383 --> 00:15:34,546
played those games. Yeah. If the superhero movies
ever kind of like die down. due to like superhero

165
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:39,189
fatigue or something like that. And we actually
have the time to dedicate to reviewing superhero

166
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:44,351
video games. That is totally a direction I would
love to take this podcast. I mean, Marvel,

167
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:50,555
if you want to send Joseph a PS5 and a copy
of the game, he'll review it. And a million

168
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:55,798
dollars, totally. I will accept that. Okay,
I mean, that's a bit much. What are you doing?

169
00:15:56,198 --> 00:15:59,359
Yeah, I may have overshot. You always ask for
more, then they'll just meet you in the middle.

170
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:05,250
Exactly, now you get it. But a word on the street
is that Marvel has been making some internal

171
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:10,592
changes to dedicate more resources toward producing
video games because they know that they're

172
00:16:10,632 --> 00:16:16,475
slacking in that department given the recent
critical and or commercial failures of Guardians

173
00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:22,817
of the Galaxy, The Avengers, and Midnight Suns.
The new Wolverine game produced by Insomniac

174
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:27,980
Games is still on track to come out, still supposed
to be amazing. We know that Motive is creating

175
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:33,594
an Iron Man game and Cliffhanger Games is creating
a Black Panther video game. From here on out,

176
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:38,917
all Marvel games are incredible 100% of the
time. I'm still waiting to hear more about

177
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:43,439
Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League and the
Wonder Ruin video game. Yeah, a lot of good

178
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:47,782
stuff in the works. I definitely gotta get a
current gen console. Besides the Switch, because

179
00:16:48,062 --> 00:16:52,144
for some reason, a lot of stuff doesn't get
ported over to the Switch. Or it just looks

180
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:57,407
really ugly when it does, like for Mortal Kombat
1. Right, right. But speaking about video games

181
00:16:57,427 --> 00:17:00,609
that we have not seen yet, that brings us to
our question of the week.

182
00:17:05,122 --> 00:17:11,846
What Marvel or DC character that has not headlined
their own video game do you want to see get

183
00:17:11,967 --> 00:17:16,210
a solo game? Yeah, I don't know if we've asked
this question before. If we have, it's been

184
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:19,992
a long time. So we could definitely do with
a fresh set of answers. But I think it's fun

185
00:17:20,012 --> 00:17:25,016
to think about potential video games that could
exist and what they would be like and what

186
00:17:25,036 --> 00:17:29,099
characters would be in them. For this question,
we're looking at more solo games in the vein

187
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:35,324
of Arkham Asylum or Spider-Man for the PS4 or
5. Right, or Wolverine, Iron Man, Black Panther,

188
00:17:35,344 --> 00:17:39,948
Wonder Woman, all of these solo games that are
coming out, games like those. Record your answer

194
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,977
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode. Now let's move on to the main

195
00:18:12,017 --> 00:18:18,069
event, where we reviewed the 2004 Marvel film,
Blade Trinity.

196
00:18:33,314 --> 00:18:39,416
Alright Blade Trinity came out in 2004 starring
Wesley Snipes, Ryan Reynolds, Jessica Biel,

197
00:18:39,916 --> 00:18:46,659
and directed by David S. Goyer. Yes, this was
made by the very same David S. Goyer who wrote

198
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:52,521
the previous two Blade films, The Dark Knight
Trilogy, and Man of Steel. The guy has done

199
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:57,684
a lot for the comic book superhero genre and
has had some incredible ideas along the way

200
00:18:58,264 --> 00:19:03,314
and just seemingly chose not to use any of them
for this movie that he directed. Yeah, I remember

201
00:19:03,354 --> 00:19:08,858
looking forward to this movie specifically because
David Esquire was so heavily involved. And

202
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:13,541
I also remember being horribly disappointed
by the final result that we got. For sure.

203
00:19:13,581 --> 00:19:17,464
Yeah, the film was definitely not up to the
standards that had been set by the previous

204
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:22,827
two Blade movies, which were directed by a tours
in Stephen Norrington and of course, Guillermo

205
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:27,610
del Toro. And they were fantastic. Those are
great movies. Yeah, great movies. If you're

206
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:33,702
not already aware how disappointing Blade Trinity
is because you haven't seen it. Go ahead and

207
00:19:33,762 --> 00:19:39,944
pause this review now and go watch either Blade
1 or Blade 2, not Blade Trinity, because it

208
00:19:40,024 --> 00:19:44,625
really just doesn't compare to the otherwise
stellar franchise. And the film's really only

209
00:19:44,665 --> 00:19:51,567
enjoyable on a very surface level, in that yes,
it has action, it has vampires, but it doesn't

210
00:19:51,587 --> 00:19:55,928
have any character building, it doesn't have
the dark narrative or artistic style that made

211
00:19:55,968 --> 00:20:00,789
the previous film so good. I don't recommend
this film. If you're still here, here's your

212
00:20:00,829 --> 00:20:06,463
spoiler warning. we've established that the
movie is not great and the quality is largely

213
00:20:06,503 --> 00:20:11,524
the result of a troubled production behind the
scenes. I don't usually go into behind the

214
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:15,865
scenes stuff in my reviews because I think the
film should stand on its own without knowing

215
00:20:16,065 --> 00:20:21,107
how the sausage is made, as it were, or the
blood sausage in this case. But I think it's

216
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:26,168
important to know the context here because when
you bite into a blood sausage and it tastes

217
00:20:26,188 --> 00:20:31,009
like shit, it's one thing to say, hmm, yes,
this sausage was not enjoyable. But really,

218
00:20:31,518 --> 00:20:38,021
I would be like, how did shit get into this
sausage, man? My wife told me to scrap the

219
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:42,824
whole sausage metaphor, but you know what? I'm
keeping it because it fits. Because behind

220
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:47,567
the scenes, Wesley Snipes basically sabotaged
the filming process because he knew the movie

221
00:20:47,607 --> 00:20:51,329
would be bad and didn't want to be involved
in it even though he was likely contractually

222
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,972
obligated. Well, he was an executive producer
on it, wasn't he? Exactly. Yeah. And that's

223
00:20:55,992 --> 00:21:00,374
kind of where the whole issue stems from. Because...
As an executive producer, he did have some

224
00:21:00,414 --> 00:21:04,675
authority here that was for the most part ignored.
You know, at first he didn't like the script,

225
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:09,717
which I entirely understand, and he didn't like
the studio's first choice of director, which

226
00:21:09,757 --> 00:21:15,138
prompted New Line to name David Goyer as the
director, which Snipes also didn't like, which

227
00:21:15,178 --> 00:21:20,980
is again totally understandable because Goyer
sucks as a director. Good writer, shitty director.

228
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:25,941
And Snipes was understandably pissed that he
had little to no control over the production

229
00:21:25,981 --> 00:21:30,575
despite the fact that he was not only the star
and a big part of why the franchise was so

230
00:21:30,615 --> 00:21:35,417
successful to begin with, but he also had an
executive producer credit. That all I understand

231
00:21:35,457 --> 00:21:39,779
where Snipes was coming from. I think he understood
that the scripts needed to be reworked from

232
00:21:39,819 --> 00:21:45,001
the ground up, basically, and I couldn't agree
more. What I can't agree with is how he exacerbated

233
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:49,703
the situation by essentially not participating
during the shoot. You know, it made the film

234
00:21:49,783 --> 00:21:54,005
even worse than it would have been, and essentially
he handed the spotlight to other characters

235
00:21:54,025 --> 00:21:58,519
that were frankly less interesting. than himself.
You know, it made him look unprofessional.

236
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:02,720
And at the end of the day, everyone was talking
more about how surprised they were that Ryan

237
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:07,522
Reynolds could be an action star than about
the character of Blade. Yeah. According to

238
00:22:07,622 --> 00:22:12,344
some actors that were on the set, like Patton
Oswalt, Wesley Snipes basically stood in his

239
00:22:12,384 --> 00:22:16,826
trailer the whole day, smoking weed, didn't
come to set when he was called and even got

240
00:22:16,846 --> 00:22:22,729
into some physical altercations with David S.
Goyer and other cast members. I feel like I

241
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:27,640
would have slapped David S. Goyer too. if I
were made to star in this movie. Jeez! So,

242
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:33,605
but no, like, you know, the whole communicating
with other production members via post-it notes

243
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:38,750
and stuff like that is just childish. I can't
imagine how awkward and uncomfortable the shooting

244
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:42,833
experience was for this film. And you know,
the end result speaks for itself. You know,

245
00:22:43,034 --> 00:22:47,257
the film crew had to make a lot of concessions,
the script had to be changed regularly, all

246
00:22:47,297 --> 00:22:51,201
to work around Wesley Snipes, who was missing
in action. Beyond that though, there were a

247
00:22:51,241 --> 00:22:55,194
lot of really... decisions made along the way
that had nothing to do with Wesley Snipes.

248
00:22:55,234 --> 00:22:59,155
You know, story-wise, the whole Blade Trinity
story is nonsensical in that it shoehorned

249
00:22:59,375 --> 00:23:05,817
Dracula, the fucking Lord of Vampires, mind
you, into a plot that really relegated him

250
00:23:05,877 --> 00:23:10,198
as a henchman to the House of Talos vampires
who were plotting to set up a chain of human

251
00:23:10,258 --> 00:23:14,660
blood farms, even though that whole plan had
very little bearing on anything outside of

252
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:19,641
the scene that it was in. The film really is
about Blade joining this ragtag group of vampire

253
00:23:19,661 --> 00:23:24,131
hunters known as the Nightstalkers, where we
see him suffer through Ryan Reynolds endless

254
00:23:24,191 --> 00:23:28,774
exposition about Dracula, the vampire final
solution and the chemical weapon that the team

255
00:23:28,794 --> 00:23:34,678
had been working on that is all told and barely
shown. Yeah, I could see how Wesley Snipes

256
00:23:35,179 --> 00:23:40,362
made the argument that he felt like the whole
franchise was moving in a direction to highlight

257
00:23:40,402 --> 00:23:46,266
these new upcoming stars and characters and
not him. Again, as we know, he's partially

258
00:23:46,306 --> 00:23:51,646
to blame for that because he was on set a lot.
But the whole film, I kind of felt like Ryan

259
00:23:51,686 --> 00:23:56,590
Reynolds was sort of making fun of Blade. And
I think that's a really bad position to put

260
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:01,694
the character in. For sure, for sure. You know,
Wesley Snipes is a goddamn legend. You know,

261
00:24:01,814 --> 00:24:06,858
Passenger 57, always bet on Black. The dude
has made some incredible action films over

262
00:24:06,878 --> 00:24:13,063
the years and to really have him kind of make
way for this new up and coming generation of

263
00:24:13,184 --> 00:24:19,829
former TV stars, I think was a little insulting
to his ego, but rightfully so, you know, in

264
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:24,719
my opinion. Absolutely. Yeah, I agree. Ryan
Reynolds is just lucky that he was charismatic

265
00:24:24,739 --> 00:24:30,240
enough and a good enough action star to actually
parlay this into future comic book roles and

266
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:34,401
eventually the ultimate comic book role for
him in Deadpool. Yeah, watching this movie,

267
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:38,983
I just was thinking like, how pissed off is
Wesley Snipes that the Deadpool movies did

268
00:24:39,023 --> 00:24:43,044
so financially well? Well, I'm sure he probably
wished he had some of that money, honestly.

269
00:24:44,144 --> 00:24:49,785
Yeah, despite having a lackluster story, what
the movie does have in spades is attitude.

270
00:24:50,262 --> 00:24:55,286
You know, it features a badass trio of vampire
hunters that kick all kinds of ass shot in

271
00:24:55,326 --> 00:25:01,531
a cinematic style reminiscent of a made for
TV sci-fi film. You know, Gone are the stylistic

272
00:25:01,571 --> 00:25:07,656
worlds of the first Blade films where they had
deep shadows, you know, satin reds, sharp contrasts

273
00:25:07,696 --> 00:25:12,741
that were a huge part of the visual appeal of
the franchise. Also Gone is the slick fight

274
00:25:12,781 --> 00:25:17,745
choreography which in this film was replaced
by what looked like slow and over rehearsed

275
00:25:17,825 --> 00:25:23,664
gestures. Also gone from Blade Trinity is all
the danger because the worst crime that this

276
00:25:23,704 --> 00:25:29,288
film commits is that it shows us that Blade
is not special. Literally anyone can become

277
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:34,030
a vampire hunter here because apparently vampires
are easier to kill than spiders. You know,

278
00:25:34,471 --> 00:25:39,654
they just explode into flames with the slightest
poke. Apparently you can fight a vampire hand

279
00:25:39,674 --> 00:25:44,296
to hand without worrying about them trying to
bite you or having enhanced strength. Right?

280
00:25:44,477 --> 00:25:49,751
Yeah, the vampires were so- weak in this film
compared to the prior two installments. Yeah,

281
00:25:49,771 --> 00:25:54,353
there were no threat whatsoever. So despite
the fact that there was, in fact, action in

282
00:25:54,393 --> 00:25:59,395
this movie, there were no stakes to the action.
Pun intended. There were actually lots of stakes.

283
00:25:59,535 --> 00:26:03,917
But, you know, the silver kind. Well, I don't
know if I necessarily agree with you there,

284
00:26:03,957 --> 00:26:08,939
because this film set up some of the more interesting
stakes of the entire franchise in the blood

285
00:26:08,979 --> 00:26:14,481
farms. They didn't do nearly enough with that.
The fact that they could take hundreds of homeless

286
00:26:14,521 --> 00:26:19,415
people from cities and just farm them for their
blood was pretty shocking the first time I

287
00:26:19,455 --> 00:26:24,837
saw this movie. I feel like those stakes pale
in comparison to the stakes of Blade 2 where

288
00:26:24,857 --> 00:26:30,700
we saw that Reavers could multiply so quickly
and to the stakes of Blade 1 where Deacon Frost

289
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:36,642
became Lemagra. Dude, Lemagra was not a threat
to society. It was supposed to be this blood

290
00:26:36,682 --> 00:26:41,805
god and it was just some dude who could regenerate
a hand. Like big fucking deal. These stakes

291
00:26:41,845 --> 00:26:47,628
were way more heavy than Lemagra. No, Lamagra
was all powerful and if they didn't have the

292
00:26:47,708 --> 00:26:52,651
EDTA that exploded him, he would have been unstoppable.
Someone would have figured that out sooner

293
00:26:52,671 --> 00:26:57,635
or later. Oh, sure. OK. No, I think the immediate
threat of this blood god guy coming at you

294
00:26:57,735 --> 00:27:02,338
seems much more high stakes than people you
don't know about getting kidnapped. But what

295
00:27:02,358 --> 00:27:05,920
if it was somebody you knew about? What if it
was like your child or your mom or something

296
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,703
like that? You know, the potential is there.
Yeah, then they probably should have showed

297
00:27:09,723 --> 00:27:13,505
something like that where this was directly
affecting the people that were in the film.

298
00:27:14,022 --> 00:27:18,844
Oh, absolutely. I think instead of killing or
kidnapping the Night Stalkers that they were

299
00:27:18,864 --> 00:27:22,586
working with, they should have put them into
a blood farm. They should have. That would

300
00:27:22,606 --> 00:27:27,189
have been way better than what they did. The
film does have a few things going for it. I'll

301
00:27:27,209 --> 00:27:32,232
say that the visual effects were decent enough.
I really like the fire effects when the vampires

302
00:27:32,252 --> 00:27:36,874
would die. And while the jokes felt entirely
out of place for a Blade film, there were some

303
00:27:36,894 --> 00:27:41,317
that made me chuckle because Ryan Reynolds has
great delivery. But let's talk more about the

304
00:27:41,357 --> 00:27:46,979
cast in our character breakdown. starting with
Blade, aka Eric Brooks, who's played by Wesley

305
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:52,060
Snipes. As we discussed before, he was entirely
checked out nearly this entire film and was

306
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,582
a huge detriment to the production. All that
said, Wesley Snipes was fine, I think, in this

307
00:27:57,622 --> 00:28:02,143
movie and the stuff that he was actually in.
I think he should have cooperated to be in

308
00:28:02,183 --> 00:28:06,825
more of the film because after giving us two
awesome movies in Blade and Blade 2, I think

309
00:28:06,885 --> 00:28:11,562
he at least deserved a worthy send off, which
he did not get. Yeah, I think he started off

310
00:28:11,702 --> 00:28:17,305
great in the movie for the most part, up until
Hannibal King showed up and then the Night

311
00:28:17,325 --> 00:28:21,628
Stalkers kind of just took over. Yeah. The scene
where he's, you know, being interrogated and

312
00:28:21,648 --> 00:28:27,591
stuff, I thought he did a OK job with his performance
and really nothing after that was memorable

313
00:28:27,631 --> 00:28:32,674
in any way. Yeah, I think largely because Blade
has no real arc in the movie. In the beginning,

314
00:28:32,714 --> 00:28:38,757
he loses his mentor and he's arrested. And even
Donna Katalos was like, you're all alone, Blade.

315
00:28:38,797 --> 00:28:43,430
No one's going to help you now. So they're really
hammering home that he's by himself, he's isolated,

316
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:48,392
but all of a sudden, he has the opportunity
to bond with and form a new family with the

317
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:53,533
Night Stalkers who rescue him. And you would
think that the film would be about him learning

318
00:28:53,613 --> 00:29:00,075
how to adopt this new family into his life and
become part of something greater, but in the

319
00:29:00,195 --> 00:29:04,536
end, he basically says fuck him and goes off
on his own. You know, he doesn't really learn

320
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:08,997
anything. He doesn't grow as a character. He
simply defeats the villain at the end and moves

321
00:29:09,097 --> 00:29:15,181
on. I think the theme they were trying to go
with for the character was purpose and purposelessness

322
00:29:15,281 --> 00:29:20,243
in your life. Like, what do you do when you're
no longer needed? And what do you do when everyone

323
00:29:20,283 --> 00:29:25,026
around you has died that you love and you don't
really want to be around anymore? I think the

324
00:29:25,046 --> 00:29:30,549
whole notion of a virus that could lead to the
extinction of the vampire race and potentially

325
00:29:30,649 --> 00:29:36,573
even Blade was one that he grappled with barely
in this movie, and I think it's something that

326
00:29:36,593 --> 00:29:41,688
they should have explored a little bit more.
just the mortality around Blade. Well, I mean,

327
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:47,193
because as long as vampires exist, Blade has
a purpose. Exactly. And at the end of the film,

328
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:52,477
they don't really do anything to address that.
They say, you know, oh, the fight is never

329
00:29:52,537 --> 00:29:57,481
lost, but isn't it because that virus is gonna
spread around the world and kill all the vampires?

330
00:29:57,861 --> 00:30:03,126
It of course is gonna move faster than Blade
is gonna be able to. So what is Blade's purpose

331
00:30:03,186 --> 00:30:08,950
at the end? They don't really say. Well, there's
a lot of ambiguity as to what the Daystar Virus

332
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:14,013
actually did because Somerset's character stated
that all the vampires in the immediate vicinity

333
00:30:14,193 --> 00:30:18,395
would automatically die. I know that they were
working on something that would destroy all

334
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:23,778
vampires, but that's not what she said in her
video. I think really the Daystar Virus only

335
00:30:23,818 --> 00:30:28,821
affects a limited range before it becomes too
spread out into the atmosphere. So they're

336
00:30:28,841 --> 00:30:32,923
gonna have to make more of this stuff and use
it against more groups of vampires, I think,

337
00:30:32,983 --> 00:30:37,005
to actually kill off all of them. And that's
where Blade's mission is headed at the end

338
00:30:37,025 --> 00:30:42,119
of the film. Okay, I didn't hear someone say
the whole vicinity thing. I was under the impression,

339
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,080
I guess, just in this post-COVID world, that
viruses like to spread. Yeah, I don't think

340
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:52,562
this works quite that way because the vampires
die immediately, as opposed to walking around

341
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:57,403
and spreading it to other vampires. So that
makes sense. It would be interesting when Daystar

342
00:30:57,503 --> 00:31:02,204
is put into mass production, if it is. And then
Blade uses it on all the vampires. And then

343
00:31:02,424 --> 00:31:06,965
what happens? You're right. I guess, like Hannibal
King's character asked, does he start teaching

344
00:31:07,278 --> 00:31:12,781
karate at the Y or something, who knows. Right.
Let's move on to Hannibal King, who was played

345
00:31:12,821 --> 00:31:17,763
by Ryan Reynolds. My first thought watching
this movie for the first time was that Ryan

346
00:31:17,803 --> 00:31:23,306
Reynolds was great, but that he was in an entirely
different movie. The more I think about it

347
00:31:23,347 --> 00:31:28,970
though, this is entirely his movie. This is
more Hannibal King's movie than it is Blades.

348
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:33,772
And while Ryan Reynolds absolutely deserved
his big action break at the time, because he

349
00:31:33,812 --> 00:31:38,439
turned into a fascinating action star, I do
wish that it wasn't with this movie. You know,

350
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:42,580
they should have put them in 2004's I, Robot
or something, but keep them away from the Blade

351
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:49,744
franchise because cool gothic action horror
does not jive with quirky, jokey action films

352
00:31:49,784 --> 00:31:54,106
like Deadpool. Like the type of action films
that Ryan Reynolds is great at. Yeah, I've

353
00:31:54,186 --> 00:31:59,268
always considered the Blade franchise to be
primarily horror and primarily horror and action.

354
00:31:59,608 --> 00:32:04,675
And you're right. The more you make fun of that
whole thing. the less serious it becomes. And

355
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:09,239
I think that's a detriment to the franchise.
Absolutely, yeah. I think they were going for

356
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:15,184
a foil for Blade because you know, Wesley Snipes
Blade is colder than ice, but it was just too

357
00:32:15,244 --> 00:32:19,588
much. It was just way too much. Yeah, too many
jokes, too much comedy for what should be a

358
00:32:19,628 --> 00:32:24,452
very serious, straightforward vampire action
horror. Hannibal King's motivation revolves,

359
00:32:24,552 --> 00:32:28,515
I think, redemption for the fact that he used
to be a vampire. You know, he wants to get

360
00:32:28,555 --> 00:32:32,718
Blade on board with the Night Stalkers, but
the guy just isn't game. So he tries to find

361
00:32:32,778 --> 00:32:37,200
humor in the situation. But the jokes that he
makes almost seem more like Ryan Reynolds real

362
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,542
life reaction to the issues with production
than any sort of actual character arc for Hannibal

363
00:32:42,562 --> 00:32:46,864
King. But fortunately for Ryan Reynolds, he's
charismatic and probably ends up being the

364
00:32:46,884 --> 00:32:51,526
best part of the film because of that. Yeah,
interestingly so. His backstory was interesting

365
00:32:51,566 --> 00:32:56,568
as well, although I am confused how they cured
his vampirism. Was that something to do with

366
00:32:56,628 --> 00:33:01,646
Karen from the first Blade movie? Or was that
Somerset? I don't remember if they said. Yeah,

367
00:33:01,666 --> 00:33:07,767
in the first Blade film, Dr. Karen Jensen invented
a cure for herself that could only be applied

368
00:33:07,807 --> 00:33:12,248
to people who weren't born vampires. You know,
she was bitten by Quinn in the first film,

369
00:33:12,528 --> 00:33:17,270
and yet she ended up not becoming a vampire.
And so I think this film carries forward that

370
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:22,071
established canon in that there is a vampire
cure. I'm really surprised they didn't find

371
00:33:22,091 --> 00:33:25,672
a way to weaponize that, though, because they're
making a weapon out of freaking everything

372
00:33:25,752 --> 00:33:31,566
in this movie. It's like, why not create a vampire
cure arrow or bullet or something? Right, if

373
00:33:31,586 --> 00:33:36,668
you could put light into a bullet, you know,
you could definitely put a chemical agent into

374
00:33:36,888 --> 00:33:42,370
a bullet. And instead of, you know, killing
all these vampires who probably didn't want

375
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:47,052
to be turned in the first place necessarily,
some of them at least, you can cure them and

376
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:51,454
have them go back to living their own lives
and perhaps even get more vampire hunters in

377
00:33:51,474 --> 00:33:56,036
the process. Pretty interesting. Let's go ahead
and move on to Abigail Whistler, who is played

378
00:33:56,076 --> 00:34:02,346
by Jessica Beale. Jessica Beale is in fact in
this movie. And that's pretty much all there

379
00:34:02,386 --> 00:34:07,167
is to be said about her performance. She barely
had anything to do here. She kicks a lot of

380
00:34:07,327 --> 00:34:12,769
ass and she was fine at that, but she was so
one note. She barely has any dialogue, you

381
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:17,290
know, right. As Whistler's daughter, they should
have given her much more character development

382
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:21,511
other than a gratuitous shower scene where she
reflects on how her father didn't want her

383
00:34:21,531 --> 00:34:26,552
to be a hunter, because that was literally all
we really got. That really informed who she

384
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:32,739
is. Yeah, that shower scene was so pointless.
I would have loved to get some more dialogue

385
00:34:32,759 --> 00:34:38,184
between her and Blade and really just talk about
her father. It could have been such a great

386
00:34:38,224 --> 00:34:43,028
like mentor mentee kind of relationship where
Blade feels very protective of her and it feels

387
00:34:43,068 --> 00:34:47,992
responsible for her in some way, almost like
as a replacement father figure. But we got

388
00:34:48,112 --> 00:34:53,556
none of that. I have to wonder if that was the
original intention for the character. Although

389
00:34:53,576 --> 00:34:59,381
it may not be because I do remember reading
somewhere that Abigail was originally Abigail

390
00:34:59,421 --> 00:35:04,759
Van Helsing. No, it was Rachel Van Helsing from
the comics. But I guess they couldn't do that

391
00:35:04,779 --> 00:35:08,701
because of Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing film.
Yeah, Hugh Jackman's Van Helsing film came

392
00:35:08,741 --> 00:35:13,063
out the same year that this one did 2004. So
they kind of had to steer clear of that because

393
00:35:13,463 --> 00:35:17,425
they would have got sued probably by Universal.
Van Helsing actually ended up being a much

394
00:35:17,605 --> 00:35:22,247
cooler vampire hunter film than Blade Trinity
did. Yeah, yeah, actually, Van Helsing is like

395
00:35:22,267 --> 00:35:27,989
a guilty pleasure of mine. Let's go to move
on to Dracula, aka Drake. I don't know why.

396
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:35,974
played by Dominic Purcell. Fucking god damn
it. Dracula in this movie sucked. And I know

397
00:35:35,994 --> 00:35:41,177
he's a vampire and he's supposed to suck, but
in this case, it wasn't blood that he sucked.

398
00:35:41,617 --> 00:35:46,560
It was ass. Who was this character? Because
it wasn't Dracula from the comics. I know that.

399
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:52,584
You know, up to this point, the Blade franchise
was known for its really compelling, cool villains

400
00:35:52,904 --> 00:35:58,709
like Deacon Frost and Nomak. both of whom were
incredibly complex and dangerous characters.

401
00:35:59,229 --> 00:36:04,214
But freaking Drake was a bargain bin mishmash
of the two that they kind of slapped some leather

402
00:36:04,254 --> 00:36:09,159
pants on and said, nailed it. You know, the
comics character of Dracula here was entirely

403
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:15,345
wasted. He was uninteresting with no real motivations.
You know, he came with the vampires to the

404
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:20,329
house of Talos because God knows why. Right.
He didn't even want to be woken up, you know.

405
00:36:20,962 --> 00:36:26,166
He has no respect for modern vampires because
they don't live by the sword like him and Blade.

406
00:36:26,626 --> 00:36:32,051
And yet, he does the bidding of these other
vampires despite the fact that they came up

407
00:36:32,091 --> 00:36:37,955
with the laziest means of acquiring blood. Not
through hunting, but by essentially farming

408
00:36:37,995 --> 00:36:43,340
them. And then he fights Blade only to be cheap-shotted
in the end with the arrowhead and he's like,

409
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:51,498
oh you fought with honor Blade. Everything about
Drake was just horrible. It was ridiculous.

410
00:36:51,998 --> 00:36:56,781
I don't want to say everything. I do like two
things that they did with him. One was making

411
00:36:56,821 --> 00:37:02,624
him like this Sumerian ancient, almost like
deity type character. They really stepped away

412
00:37:02,664 --> 00:37:07,487
from Bram Stroker's version and I guess the
comic version, like you mentioned, to make

413
00:37:07,507 --> 00:37:12,930
him something much more ancient. I thought that
was kind of interesting. I also didn't hate

414
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:18,073
the look of him when he was in his full vampire
form. I wish they would have given him wings

415
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:21,486
or something like that. because that would have
been very different from something that Blade

416
00:37:21,506 --> 00:37:26,207
has gone up against in the past. Yeah, maybe
it was out of budget or whatever. But those

417
00:37:26,227 --> 00:37:30,349
two things were fine. Everything else you write,
that was garbage. Yeah, actually, Steven Norrington

418
00:37:30,389 --> 00:37:36,470
designed the look of full out transformed Dracula
as this like deeming creature. I did think

419
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:40,731
that was pretty cool up until the point where
he said motherfucker, which I thought was the

420
00:37:40,771 --> 00:37:47,173
cheesiest shit I've ever seen in my entire life.
So stupid. I love they had like a chain on

421
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:52,751
to those so hip. It makes no sense for Demon
Dracula to be wearing a gold chain. Last but

422
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:57,353
not least, let's talk about Donnika Talos who
is played by Parker Posey. I thought I couldn't

423
00:37:57,373 --> 00:38:03,156
roll my eyes harder at a villain in a film more
than Drake and yet here we have Parker Posey

424
00:38:03,216 --> 00:38:08,218
as Donnika Talos who is so campy it's like she
thought she was in the Joel Schumacher Batman

425
00:38:08,238 --> 00:38:14,440
movies. She looks and acts so ridiculous it's
clear Parker Posey didn't have any knowledge

426
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,287
or perhaps respect for the source material.
Or maybe she was just too uncertain how to

427
00:38:19,327 --> 00:38:24,150
approach the character, so just decided to ham
it up with the fangs. Regardless, Parker Posey

428
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:28,073
was not good and I don't understand how she
was cast in this movie. I kind of feel like

429
00:38:28,113 --> 00:38:33,557
she hadn't seen the prior Blade films. Oh, I
guarantee you she didn't. Yeah, no, I do feel

430
00:38:33,577 --> 00:38:37,340
like a lot of it was due to the way she was
written. I think she was just trying to make

431
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:43,064
the best of what was on the page for her. But
yeah, it was not well done by any means. Damn

432
00:38:43,144 --> 00:38:51,423
it, Blade. We had him. And her relationship
with Drake was just weird. Because like, she

433
00:38:51,463 --> 00:38:55,465
didn't want to control him, she didn't want
to like clue him in onto anything that they

434
00:38:55,485 --> 00:39:01,127
were doing. It just didn't make any sense whatsoever.
Well, she just wanted Drake to kill Blade because

435
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:05,449
Blade was the only thing that could have stopped
their vampire's final solution, their human

436
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:11,312
farms. Really, she was just trying to use Drake,
but the idea of Dracula, Lord of the Vampires,

437
00:39:11,352 --> 00:39:17,142
being used by some dumbass just doesn't sit
well with me. It really, really made me miss

438
00:39:17,162 --> 00:39:22,445
like the vampire councils that we saw in the
early Blade films. This was just such a far

439
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:27,848
cry from then. So depressing by comparison.
Yeah, it was like David Goyer was trying to

440
00:39:27,868 --> 00:39:31,810
make a Christopher Guest movie considering he
also cast, you know, John Michael Higgins as

441
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:36,433
Dr. Vance. That's right. It's so weird. You
know, if there was ever a Venn diagram that

442
00:39:36,453 --> 00:39:41,396
should never have existed, it's Christopher
Guest comedies intersecting with the Blade

443
00:39:41,416 --> 00:39:47,301
franchise in Blade Trinity. I hate that that's
a thing. I didn't think about that. That's

444
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:47,605
great.

445
00:39:55,086 --> 00:39:59,330
Let's go ahead and move into the story highlights.
Danica Talos and her group of vampires enter

446
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:04,616
an ancient tomb in the Sumerian desert where
they find the original vampire, Dracula, as

447
00:40:04,656 --> 00:40:08,961
part of their final solution against humanity.
To prevent Blade from interfering in their

448
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:13,706
plans, the House of Talos film him murdering
one of their human familiars, leading to a

449
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:19,083
manhunt from the FBI and the local chief of
police. I want to know how Dracula actually

450
00:40:19,243 --> 00:40:25,088
factored into their plans considering that they
had this idea to frame Blade, get him arrested,

451
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:29,633
and then likely kill him while incarcerated,
right? Drake doesn't have to be any part of

452
00:40:29,673 --> 00:40:34,617
that, so why did they go dig him up to begin
with? Yes, they wanted him to kill Blade, but

453
00:40:34,817 --> 00:40:39,742
they also had this other plan that was just
as, if not more so, effective. Yeah, I was

454
00:40:39,762 --> 00:40:44,626
wondering if maybe they just dug Dracula up
because they could? Because they- discovered

455
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:49,108
his location or found where they thought he
might be and just wanted to see what it would

456
00:40:49,128 --> 00:40:54,531
be like to resurrect him. But yeah, that seems
kind of risky when you have this huge plan

457
00:40:55,032 --> 00:41:00,875
and the potential for the original vampire to
resurrect and upturn things. Yes, essentially

458
00:41:00,915 --> 00:41:05,498
since the first action that Dracula does coming
out of the ground is fucking bite another vampire's

459
00:41:05,518 --> 00:41:10,201
head clean off, you know. Exactly. At that point,
I would have been like, maybe this isn't a

460
00:41:10,241 --> 00:41:15,605
great idea to have. Drake as our backup plan
against Blade. Every time you call him Drake,

461
00:41:15,665 --> 00:41:22,872
I die a little. Also mentioning their whole
plan to frame Blade and capture him. Why the

462
00:41:22,972 --> 00:41:27,155
fuck didn't they just kill him when they had
him at the police station? Considering they

463
00:41:27,356 --> 00:41:32,300
own the police. I kind of have an issue with
this whole plan in general because largely

464
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:37,525
Blade kind of existed in his own world apart
from the rest of humanity in the first two

465
00:41:37,545 --> 00:41:42,435
Blade films. So it's really strange to have
like normal humans and like the FBI and the

466
00:41:42,455 --> 00:41:47,477
local police all of a sudden be a factor in
this. When they were largely absent in previous

467
00:41:47,517 --> 00:41:52,039
installments, like in the first Blade movie,
Blade even point blank tried to shoot Deacon

468
00:41:52,059 --> 00:41:56,701
Frost in broad daylight at the park. And Deacon
Frost dodged the bullets. We didn't ever know

469
00:41:56,721 --> 00:42:00,843
what happened to the bullets or if the police
were called or anything like that. But it made

470
00:42:00,883 --> 00:42:05,585
sense for that world because things felt so
surreal stylistically, you know, that's not

471
00:42:05,605 --> 00:42:10,256
the case for this film. Well, I just imagine
that the police largely avoided Blade because

472
00:42:10,296 --> 00:42:16,200
they were owned by the vampires. That makes
sense. You know, it was weird seeing them talk

473
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:20,603
about Blade like on the news. Yeah, it's like
if they were talking about Batman on the news,

474
00:42:20,623 --> 00:42:25,427
like trying to dissect them psychologically
and stuff, you know, you don't see that done

475
00:42:25,467 --> 00:42:30,651
in these movies because it's a stupid ass idea.
You know, these characters should be so mysterious

476
00:42:30,671 --> 00:42:35,162
to the general public and they shouldn't be
debated on public access television. Well,

477
00:42:35,182 --> 00:42:39,784
I mean, they did that with Superman in Batman
v Superman, and I thought that was interesting.

478
00:42:40,304 --> 00:42:44,407
But definitely not with Blade, definitely not
with a character that's supposed to be hunting

479
00:42:44,447 --> 00:42:49,870
the secretive class in society. Right. You know,
Superman is fair game for public debate because

480
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:55,753
he's not hiding in the shadows like Blade is.
Or vampires. Right. Meanwhile, Abigail Whistler

481
00:42:55,773 --> 00:43:01,276
hunts a group of teenage vampires who are so
lame, I'm 100% convinced that Deacon Frost

482
00:43:01,356 --> 00:43:05,962
and Damascenos would have actually paid to have
them killed. Yeah, it was a horrible setup

483
00:43:06,043 --> 00:43:10,777
for Abigail, I thought. It's like, oh, she could
beat the shit out of these punk asses. Who

484
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:17,884
can't look at them? Back to the movie, the authorities
track Blade and Whistler to their secret base

485
00:43:18,005 --> 00:43:22,708
and infiltrate it killing Whistler and apprehending
Blade. He's taken to the local police station

486
00:43:22,969 --> 00:43:28,193
where the vampire hunting team called the Night
Stalkers break him out. This movie really made

487
00:43:28,253 --> 00:43:34,098
me miss Chris Christopherson as Whistler for
sure. I know David Esquire tried to kill the

488
00:43:34,118 --> 00:43:38,041
character off in the first Blade movie, but
he was just so damn good he had to keep coming

489
00:43:38,081 --> 00:43:43,225
back for each one. This movie they finally got
rid of him and the film really suffered after

490
00:43:43,265 --> 00:43:47,347
his death. Yeah, and lo and behold, it's the
worst Blade movie, so what does that tell you?

491
00:43:47,507 --> 00:43:51,530
I think he just gives such a good performance
as the character. Like, you can't help but

492
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:55,472
love the guy. Yeah, he definitely gave something
to the franchise that the Nightstalkers could

493
00:43:55,492 --> 00:44:00,755
not replace. 100%. Taking you back to their
headquarters, the Nightstalkers fill Blade

494
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:05,497
in on their intel regarding Drake and how they
will need to join forces to stop him and the

495
00:44:05,517 --> 00:44:11,260
vampire Final Solution. Meanwhile, Dracula walks
around town and then kills some hot topic workers.

496
00:44:13,614 --> 00:44:20,340
Uh, why was that scene in this movie? I don't
know. Damn it. We've got Dracula vibrators.

497
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:25,745
Okay. I mean, they're, you know, trying to show
how low vampires had come and that they had

498
00:44:25,785 --> 00:44:31,630
become a pop culture gag since Dracula's time,
but it was such a stupid scene. Back to the

499
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:38,837
movie, Blade, Hannibal King, and Abigail interrogate
familiars around town. Meanwhile, Abigail listens

500
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:44,531
to her iPod. The whole music thing, I thought
was weird. It was just like a hamfisted kind

501
00:44:44,571 --> 00:44:50,694
of way to insert music into the movie for the
soundtrack, I feel like. Yeah. Either that

502
00:44:50,734 --> 00:44:55,836
or like Apple paid them to be in the movie.
Apple did not pay them. The most they did was

503
00:44:55,976 --> 00:45:01,738
offer the crew a 60% discount off of the purchases
that they made for the film. Wait, is that

504
00:45:01,798 --> 00:45:08,301
real? Yeah. Jeez. Why even put it in then? I
don't know. It would have been so easy to cut

505
00:45:08,361 --> 00:45:15,466
out, you know? Oh she's so hip she listens to
music as she hunts. Whoa. Back to the movie,

506
00:45:15,506 --> 00:45:21,011
Blade and the Nightstalkers play a visit to
Dr. Edgar Vance, a notable psychiatrist. They

507
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:26,014
find Drake there and Blade chases him through
the city, though Drake escapes. Meanwhile,

508
00:45:26,435 --> 00:45:31,379
Abigail gets naked and takes a shower to wash
away the blood. We don't see anyone else showering

509
00:45:31,419 --> 00:45:36,482
the blood away, but you know, it's Jessica Biel.
There you go. Back to the movie, the Night

510
00:45:36,522 --> 00:45:42,043
Stalkers discover one of Donna Katalos' business
fronts, Biomedica Enterprises. Investigating,

511
00:45:42,423 --> 00:45:47,305
Blade and Abigail learn the vampire's final
solution is their blood farms where humans

512
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:52,546
are medically sedated and their blood regularly
harvested. Which again, not a terrible idea.

513
00:45:52,586 --> 00:45:56,887
In fact, they made a whole movie about it with
Daybreakers as like Ethan Hawke and Willem

514
00:45:56,907 --> 00:46:01,689
Defoe. That was a great movie. Oh really? I
hadn't seen it. But I definitely think the

515
00:46:01,709 --> 00:46:07,219
blood farm had much more potential to be explored
in this For sure. While Blade and Abigail were

516
00:46:07,259 --> 00:46:11,281
gone, Drake shows up at the Nightstalker's base.
I don't know how he learned where the base

517
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:16,004
was, but he kills most of the Nightstalkers,
abducting Hannibal King and a small girl named

518
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:21,268
Zoe. King is taken to the House of Talos, where
Danica and her goons interrogate him about

519
00:46:21,308 --> 00:46:26,711
Blade and the Nightstalker's plans to create
a vampire chemical weapon called Daystar. Well

520
00:46:26,731 --> 00:46:32,511
that's true, how did they find the Nightstalker's
base? No one knows to this day. All of a sudden

521
00:46:32,531 --> 00:46:37,996
the camera pans up and we see Whistlers there,
who is Drake in disguise. We don't know anything

522
00:46:38,276 --> 00:46:42,580
more about how he got there or how the nice
Ockers got discovered. They should have established

523
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:48,304
that maybe Drake has like superhuman senses
and like a keen sense of smell like a wolf

524
00:46:48,364 --> 00:46:51,887
or something and that's how he was able to track
them down. Wouldn't that be great? That's a

525
00:46:51,907 --> 00:46:56,751
great idea. That is now my head cannon. That's
what happened. Armed with a Daystar weapon,

526
00:46:56,831 --> 00:47:02,727
Blade and Abigail infiltrate the house of Talos.
rescuing King and kicking ass. Blade sword

527
00:47:02,767 --> 00:47:08,230
fights Drake, during which Abigail fires the
Daystar weapon from her bow. Her shot misses,

528
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:13,373
but Blade grabs the arrow and lodges it in Drake's
heart, triggering a chemical reaction that

529
00:47:13,393 --> 00:47:18,535
goes airborne and kills all the vampires in
the facility. The fight scenes I thought were

530
00:47:18,695 --> 00:47:23,446
pretty good when it came to Blade going up against
all the vampires in the House of Talos. I did

531
00:47:23,486 --> 00:47:28,290
not like Abigail's hand-to-hand fights against
the vampires again because I don't think normal

532
00:47:28,330 --> 00:47:33,315
people should be able to go hand-to-hand with
vampires. I also didn't care for Hannibal King's

533
00:47:33,355 --> 00:47:37,899
fights in this, especially the one with Triple
H. I didn't care for a Triple H at all in this

534
00:47:37,959 --> 00:47:43,784
entire movie, like just cut him from the film
completely. Why is that? He's just a really

535
00:47:43,884 --> 00:47:50,866
shitty actor. I thought he was okay. I thought
the metal fangs were stupid. The way he went

536
00:47:50,966 --> 00:47:54,568
out was pretty dumb, you know, biting into one
of the sundog bullets. I thought that was kind

537
00:47:54,588 --> 00:47:58,270
of lame. I actually didn't mind the fight between
him and Hannibal King. But you know, also if

538
00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:03,473
they cut it out of the film, I wouldn't have
cared. I do have to ask, what's worse, a Hulk

539
00:48:03,533 --> 00:48:10,417
poodle or a vampire Pomeranian? That's a great
question. Uh, you know, I actually like the

540
00:48:10,457 --> 00:48:16,020
vampire Pomeranian as a visual gag in this movie
more than I liked a French poodle with Hulk

541
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:21,923
strength. So gotta go with the Pomeranian on
this one. Sorry, the correct answer was neither.

542
00:48:23,663 --> 00:48:29,866
Neither of them work. I really thought it was
stupid in the final fight when Drake catches

543
00:48:30,006 --> 00:48:36,228
the Daystar arrow only to drop it on the ground
right next to his enemy who could easily pick

544
00:48:36,268 --> 00:48:40,930
it up and stab him with it. Like if you're going
to catch the arrow, you know, toss it aside.

545
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:45,232
Don't drop it into the hands of your foe, you
know? Well, I think he just didn't know what

546
00:48:45,272 --> 00:48:51,394
it was. Who cares? Nothing that's any excuse.
Yeah. Most convenient shit ever. Well, I think

547
00:48:51,474 --> 00:48:56,456
really it was just so that Abigail wasn't the
one who delivered the killing blow, but Blade

548
00:48:56,496 --> 00:49:02,497
was. Yeah, but like the setup was horrible.
Yeah, for sure. Dying, Drake commends Blade

549
00:49:02,717 --> 00:49:07,759
and tells him that he is the future of the vampire
race. As a parting gift, he shapeshifts into

550
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:12,660
Blade's body, letting authorities believe they've
apprehended him. However, Blade is still out

551
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:18,666
there, continuing his war against vampires.
And thank God it's over. I thought it was a

552
00:49:18,726 --> 00:49:24,590
strange gift from Drake considering that his
body reverted while on the autopsy table. So

553
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:30,454
if the goal was to convince authorities that
they had in fact apprehended the guy they've

554
00:49:30,474 --> 00:49:35,697
been after this whole time, it was short-lived.
It was only enough time to allow Blade to escape,

555
00:49:35,817 --> 00:49:40,661
but Blade had already escaped by the time that
the authorities arrived. He was dragged out

556
00:49:40,701 --> 00:49:43,283
of there, I think, by Abigail and Hannibal King.

557
00:49:48,506 --> 00:49:55,110
I think by the end they just assumed that Blade
this entire time was just some white guy disguised

558
00:49:55,130 --> 00:50:00,253
as a black man. Oh my god. I hope that's not
the case. I hope that's not what they thought

559
00:50:00,293 --> 00:50:06,596
because that would be problematic. We'll say
that. But that's the end of the film. It's

560
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:12,840
not a great movie. The story is not there. The
action is there. But again, no stakes because

561
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:17,274
essentially you could trip over a vampire and
kill it. I remember walking out of the theater

562
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:22,516
for the first time seeing this movie in 2004,
just being really disappointed. It was the

563
00:50:22,556 --> 00:50:27,639
most disappointed I think I had been since the
1998 Blade movie. Because that film and everything

564
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:32,141
after that was pretty good. You know, we got
X-Men, we got the Spider-Man films. I guess

565
00:50:32,641 --> 00:50:37,243
the 2004 Punisher movie wasn't that great. But
I think I felt more disappointed by Blade Trinity

566
00:50:37,603 --> 00:50:43,525
considering the films that had come prior. Oh,
yeah, absolutely. To ultimately see this franchise.

567
00:50:44,034 --> 00:50:49,416
go down with such a sour note was depressing.
Depressing is a better word than disappointing,

568
00:50:49,616 --> 00:50:54,418
for sure. Yeah, that's definitely how I felt
at the time. Overall, between the low stakes

569
00:50:54,498 --> 00:50:59,160
action, the non-existent character development,
the campy villains, and the sidelined main

570
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:04,382
character make the film feel like it's trying
to ice skate uphill. I give the film two and

571
00:51:04,402 --> 00:51:10,745
a half stars out of five, a rotten score on
Rotten Tomatoes. Yeah, I would agree with that.

572
00:51:11,365 --> 00:51:18,465
A lot of people think... 2.5 is an average rating,
but you know, per a grading scale, it's an

573
00:51:18,745 --> 00:51:24,849
F, it's a 50%, it's pretty bad. I can even see
a case made for two stars, although I definitely

574
00:51:24,909 --> 00:51:30,192
didn't think it was two stars watching it. Same,
yeah. Despite how much negative things you

575
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:36,075
can say about the film in a review, I will admit
that watching it is a somewhat lighter experience.

576
00:51:36,555 --> 00:51:40,882
Not that we would recommend doing so. Stick
with the first two Blade films. But that does

577
00:51:40,902 --> 00:51:44,123
