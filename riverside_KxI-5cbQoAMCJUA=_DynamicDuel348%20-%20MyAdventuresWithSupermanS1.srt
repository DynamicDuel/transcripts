00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:29,151
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:29,491 --> 00:00:34,577
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based

4
00:00:34,717 --> 00:00:41,164
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother Johnny DC. And in this episode

5
00:00:41,204 --> 00:00:47,607
we are going to review season one of My Adventures
with Superman. which is an animated television

6
00:00:47,627 --> 00:00:53,531
series that debuted on Cartoon Network and Max.
It was 10 episodes long and it was pretty good.

7
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:56,714
Can't wait to talk about it later on this episode.
Before that, we're going to break down the

8
00:00:56,754 --> 00:01:00,697
latest comic book movie news to come out this
past week, of which we got news about some

9
00:01:00,877 --> 00:01:06,742
release date changes for Marvel shows on Disney+.
As always, we list our segment times in our

10
00:01:06,782 --> 00:01:10,464
episode description, so feel free to check out
the show notes if you want to skip ahead to

11
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:15,138
a particular topic. As our listeners may know,
our dual simulator is so advanced that it's

12
00:01:15,178 --> 00:01:19,525
gained sentience, and it's named itself the
artificial life form for running extensive

13
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:26,415
duels, just a rather very intelligent Simulator
9000 or Alfred Jarvis 9000. Here's a quick

14
00:01:26,455 --> 00:01:32,756
message for our listeners, so listen up. Why
hello there. Do you love listening and chatting

15
00:01:32,796 --> 00:01:37,942
about Marvel and DC? Then become a part of the
dynamic dual community on Patreon, where you

16
00:01:37,982 --> 00:01:43,267
can choose from three tiers. The dynamic two-o
tier lets you listen to this podcast without

17
00:01:43,388 --> 00:01:48,113
ads and gives you access to its discord chat
group, where you can chat with Johnny DC and

18
00:01:48,153 --> 00:01:53,059
Marvelous Joe. The Fantastic Four tier gives
you that and more with two bonus episodes each

19
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,541
month, including bloopers and top ten shows
where Johnny and Joe count down your favourite

20
00:01:57,581 --> 00:02:02,604
Marvel and DC subjects. The X-Force tier makes
you an executive producer of Dynamic Duel,

21
00:02:02,964 --> 00:02:06,886
where every month you help the hosts choose
what to review and who to fight against each

22
00:02:06,946 --> 00:02:12,888
other. And finally, the Dynamite Podcast Network
tier allows aspiring podcasters to create their

23
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:16,230
own battle-focused show using this Monte Carlo
simulator.

24
00:02:35,944 --> 00:02:41,648
Thanks AJ9K, and thanks to everyone who supports
the podcast. Be sure to tune into the Max Destruction

25

Network, to witness the bare-knuckle across

26
00:02:48,886 --> 00:02:53,768
film and television. This week on Wednesday
September 6th, you can learn who would win

27

30
00:03:09,514 --> 00:03:15,737
a fight between Tire Harabelle from Bleach and
Hoshigaki Kasami from Naruto. I am horrible

31
00:03:15,777 --> 00:03:20,006
at pronouncing these names. Damn it, Zach. But
no, I'm actually blown away by your character

32
00:03:20,026 --> 00:03:23,888
selection. I don't know who these characters
are half the time, but it's always fascinating

33
00:03:23,928 --> 00:03:27,649
to learn about these anime characters in the
show. Yeah, totally. Makes me want to watch

34
00:03:27,809 --> 00:03:33,831
all of the shows if only I had time. Visit dynamicpodcast.com

out of the way, quick to the no prize. A no

36
00:03:40,573 --> 00:03:45,207
prize is an award Marvel used to give out to
fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel No Prize,

37
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:50,210
is a digital award we post on Instagram and
in our email newsletter for the person that

38
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:55,193
we feel gave the best answer to our question
of the week. Last week we asked you guys to

39
00:03:55,253 --> 00:04:01,878
pitch us your perfect Marvel vs. DC video game
and to tell us what it would be like. We only

40
00:04:01,918 --> 00:04:07,101
got two eligible answers. To be fair, we are
recording this episode early due to Labor Day

41
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:11,515
weekend. Right, right. But still, that's not
a whole lot of participation. For what I thought

42
00:04:11,535 --> 00:04:15,418
was a pretty interesting question, like just
describe the most awesome Marvel versus DC

43
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,340
video game you can think of. Yeah, like Rampage,
but with Lestaro or Fing Feng Fum. That's just

44
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,303
off the top of my head, guys. Fucking bejeweled
blitz, but it's Marvel versus DC. I don't know

45
00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:30,346
how you would do that, but you can imagine it'd
be pretty awesome. It would be Infinity Stones

46
00:04:30,466 --> 00:04:35,909
and Green Lantern Rings. Boom, off the top of
my head, it just happens. It's that easy, guys,

47
00:04:35,929 --> 00:04:41,211
to call in. We did get pretty solid answers
for the two answers we did get, so let's go

48
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:45,072
ahead and run down our honorable mention and
the no prize winner. Our first honorable mention

49
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:50,714
goes to Colby Hentges. Who said? Okay, I've
never actually heard of Skullgirls, but I looked

50
00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:55,956
it up and it looks pretty interesting. Basically,
the premise of the game is you're a bunch of

51
00:04:56,096 --> 00:05:00,746
goth schoolgirls that are fighting against each
other that have like magic powers. The gameplay

52
00:05:00,766 --> 00:05:05,810
style is very much in the vein of Marvel vs.
Capcom, but like way more insane. And you can

53
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:11,414
choose any combination of up to three fighters
per matchup, kind of like how in Marvel vs.

54
00:05:11,434 --> 00:05:15,617
Capcom, you select two fighters and they fight
back to back or you can switch off in between

55
00:05:15,637 --> 00:05:20,440
them during the course of the fight. It looks
like a pretty damn cool game. It would be incredible

56
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,544
to have a Marvel vs. DC video game like this.
Yeah, with the appeal really being that you

57
00:05:25,584 --> 00:05:29,878
don't have to select just one character to fight
with. but up to three or maybe more for this

58
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:35,100
game. Like give me the entire seven roster member
Justice League to fight with. That'd be dope.

59
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,162
I would do it. I'd play the shit out of the
game. I do love how you're comparing it to

60
00:05:39,182 --> 00:05:46,045
Marvel versus Capcom though, instead of just
Street Fighter. Just say Street Fighter. Well,

61
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:51,127
I always thought of Marvel versus Capcom as
being a much more over the top, crazy video

62
00:05:51,147 --> 00:05:54,548
game than Street Fighter. Although, you know,
Street Fighter has gotten pretty over the top

63
00:05:54,608 --> 00:05:58,902
as well over the years. But yeah, they're both
great games. Great answer Colby! We do have

64
00:05:58,922 --> 00:06:05,325
to give a shout out to Christopher Menotti who
recorded an answer, but he described a Arkham-style

65
00:06:05,405 --> 00:06:10,567
nightcrawler video game with no DC element to
it. So it didn't qualify unfortunately, but

66
00:06:10,607 --> 00:06:15,009
thank you for taking the time to record your
answer. The winner of this week's No Prize

67
00:06:15,049 --> 00:06:21,992
though is Matt Lamb. Who said? Yeah considering
Ed Boon made comments regarding a Marvel vs

68
00:06:22,032 --> 00:06:27,056
DC video game last week and... Ed Boon is the
head of NetherRealm Studios, who makes the

69
00:06:27,096 --> 00:06:31,720
Mortal Kombat and Injustice video games. It
seems most likely that if this game were going

70
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:37,204
to be made, it would be in that same Mortal
Kombat style. And they're great games. Yeah,

71
00:06:37,244 --> 00:06:41,548
they're fantastic. I love NetherRealm storytelling.
You know, they created Injustice, which is

72
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:46,892
just fantastic. They also have incredible character
designs. They've gotten much better at that

73
00:06:46,952 --> 00:06:52,123
than they have in the past, I feel. So I would
love to see them render all of the Marvel and

74
00:06:52,143 --> 00:06:56,664
DC characters that they would have on their
rosters. It would be insanely cool. And brutal

75
00:06:56,844 --> 00:07:02,226
AF. It's freaking Netherrealm. Right, right.
If I'm being honest, I actually do like the

76
00:07:02,466 --> 00:07:07,707
Mortal Kombat renders more than Capcom's, which
tend to be a little bit cartoony, you know,

77
00:07:07,747 --> 00:07:12,169
like in the Street Fighter vein. Right. Mortal
Kombat approaches the characters almost like

78
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:17,038
if they were live action movie costumes, you
know? Right. And I think that'd be really cool

79
00:07:17,058 --> 00:07:20,500
to see in a video game for Marvel and DC. I
think they'd have to brighten up their palette

80
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:25,162
a bit because a lot of their games feel like
very dark. Mm hmm. But yeah, it could totally

81
00:07:25,182 --> 00:07:29,323
work. I think it would be fantastic. Now, I
know Matt Lamb said that the characters wouldn't

82
00:07:29,363 --> 00:07:34,826
have fatalities, but special finishers. But
screw that. What would Batman's fatality be?

83
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:40,288
He would just run your ass over with the Batmobile.
That's pretty good. What about Spider-Man?

84
00:07:40,788 --> 00:07:45,642
Spider-Man's Mortal Kombat fatality, he would
totally like Mark of Kane. your shit up. Like

85
00:07:45,662 --> 00:07:49,984
he'd stick his hand onto your face and then
just rip your face right off. Oh damn. And

86
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:55,366
then he'd web up your entire body and then web
swing you and slam you into the ground until

87
00:07:55,386 --> 00:08:01,789
you're just like bag of mush. I will accept
that. Great answer, Matlam. Congrats for winning

88
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:06,371
this week's no prize. If you, the listener,
want a shot at winning your own no prize, stay

89
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:10,792
tuned to later on in this episode where we'll
be asking another question of the week. And

90
00:08:10,832 --> 00:08:13,013
now that that's done, on to the news.

91
00:08:18,638 --> 00:08:23,419
Alright this past week we heard from the Hollywood
Reporter that Marvel is shuffling their TV

92
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:31,063
calendar setting new dates for The Agatha Show,
Echo, X-Men 97, and What If. Initially we were

93
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:36,425
supposed to get all of these shows this year
in 2023, considering it's already September

94
00:08:36,565 --> 00:08:40,446
it seemed highly unlikely that this was all
going to happen this year, especially due to

95
00:08:40,506 --> 00:08:45,768
the ongoing writers and actor strikes. Disney
Plus is still going to release Loki Season

96
00:08:45,808 --> 00:08:50,682
2 this year starting on October 6th. But the
first show to get pushed back was What If,

97
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:55,364
which is now going to debut around Christmas
time of this year, so the very end of the year.

98
00:08:55,564 --> 00:08:59,705
Echo was originally supposed to drop in November,
all the episodes were going to drop at the

99
00:08:59,725 --> 00:09:06,407
same time, but that got pushed to January of
2024. The animated series X-Men 97, which is

100
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:11,288
going to be a continuation of the classic 1990
series from Fox, that's going to come out sometime

101
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:19,387
early 2024, around springtime. And then finally...
Agatha Coven of Chaos has been renamed to Agatha

102
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:25,168
Darkhold Diaries, and it's going to drop in
the fall season of 2024. It's crazy because

103
00:09:25,328 --> 00:09:30,590
the Agatha show was originally named House of
Harkness, then it got renamed to Coven of Chaos,

104
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:38,092
and now it's called Darkhold Diaries. It's like
pick a name, holy shit. Seriously. But I do

105
00:09:38,132 --> 00:09:43,193
think that like right around Halloween time
is a perfect time to drop an Agatha television

106
00:09:43,213 --> 00:09:48,428
series. Do you like the name Darkhold Diaries?
I mean, sure, it works just like the rest of

107
00:09:48,448 --> 00:09:52,671
them work. I think they all were fine. I liked
Covenant of Chaos, I'm not gonna lie. Yeah,

108
00:09:52,691 --> 00:09:58,915
I liked that one too. But considering that we
now have a show dropping early 2024 in Echo,

109
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:05,739
spring 2024 in X-Men 97 and autumn 2024. in
Agatha, Darkhold Diaries, it makes me think

110
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:11,001
that other shows that have been filmed or partially
filmed such as Ironheart, Daredevil Born Again,

111
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:17,364
and Wonder Man are all getting pushed into 2025.
Which is possibly a good thing. I know there's

112
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:21,586
a lot of concern going around that Marvel is
producing too much content that people aren't

113
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:27,048
able to keep up with and therefore are kind
of losing interest in. And so I think the aim

114
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:33,090
is to focus on the quality and make sure that
release dates are staggered to hold audience

115
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:37,752
interest. Yeah, I think it's a smart move. Bob
Iger pretty much admitted that there was too

116
00:10:37,772 --> 00:10:42,714
much Marvel content on Disney+. This gives them
some breathing room to kind of reevaluate what

117
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:46,655
they want to do with each series and make sure
it's a little bit more cohesive, I think, going

118
00:10:46,715 --> 00:10:52,417
forward, hopefully. But speaking of all these
shows, in particular X-Men 97, that brings

119
00:10:52,477 --> 00:10:53,737
us to our question of the week.

120
00:10:58,218 --> 00:11:05,420
90s kids, what was your favorite Marvel or DC
cartoon from the 90s and why? Basically, if

121
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,141
you're listening to this and you were born after
the 90s, you can still answer but also you're

122
00:11:09,161 --> 00:11:13,642
too young. You're just too young. You're too
young. Be older, because we're looking for

123
00:11:13,762 --> 00:11:19,404
90s cartoons. It was the best era for Marvel
and DC cartoons, in my humble opinion. Yeah,

124
00:11:19,424 --> 00:11:22,945
I think it was definitely like the Renaissance
after shows like Super Friends and stuff like

125
00:11:22,965 --> 00:11:27,876
that, you know? Yeah. Record your answer at

our favorite answer and award that person a

129
00:11:41,008 --> 00:11:46,172
Dynamic Duel No Prize that we'll post to Instagram
and our email newsletter. Be sure to answer

130
00:11:46,192 --> 00:11:47,673
before September 9th.

131
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:58,584
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and move into

132
00:11:58,624 --> 00:12:05,678
our main event, where we review the DC animated
series on Cartoon Network and Max, My Adventures

133
00:12:05,818 --> 00:12:07,361
with Superman, Season 1.

134
00:12:22,766 --> 00:12:28,007
Adventures with Superman is a 10-episode animated
series made for Cartoon Network's Adult Swim

135
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:34,369
programming block and the Mac streaming platform
by the series' showrunners Jake Wyatt, Brandon

136
00:12:34,409 --> 00:12:40,731
Kloffer, and Josie Campbell. The series explores
Clark Kent's early career as both a journalist

137
00:12:40,771 --> 00:12:46,373
for the Daily Planet and as the superhero Superman,
as well as the burgeoning relationship with

138
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:51,931
his colleague Lois Lane. It was a fantastic
series. that modernizes Superman in a way that

139
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:57,374
has never been done before. I definitely recommend
watching it. It's available on Max once again.

140
00:12:57,774 --> 00:13:03,198
Please watch it before listening any further
to this spoiler review. Yeah, even as a Marvel

141
00:13:03,218 --> 00:13:08,901
fan, I highly recommend this series. It actually
turned out better than expected when the executive

142
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:14,945
producers requested that we review the show.
I was kind of a whiny bitch about it. I didn't

143
00:13:14,965 --> 00:13:20,341
want to do it. I feel like we've seen this story
done well before in the Smallville television

144
00:13:20,381 --> 00:13:25,806
series and even in animated form recently with
the Man of Tomorrow movie. But this show ended

145
00:13:25,866 --> 00:13:29,869
up blowing all my expectations away and when
I first started watching it I was like, what's

146
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:35,834
this cartoony shit? By the time I was done,
I considered it one of the best interpretations

147
00:13:36,154 --> 00:13:40,498
of Superman's origin story that has existed.
Way better than Man of Tomorrow, honestly.

148
00:13:40,638 --> 00:13:45,758
Oh, absolutely. Yeah, no question. Like you,
when this cartoon was first announced... I

149
00:13:45,978 --> 00:13:49,581
can't say I was looking forward to it, and I
was also surprised when it was decided that

150
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:54,665
we were going to review it, because we don't
usually review Cartoon Network shows. You know,

151
00:13:54,845 --> 00:13:59,209
considering the fact that the episodes were
dropping on Macs shortly after their Cartoon

152
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:03,913
Network debut, and because the episode count
was relatively short, we figured we'd review

153
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:07,676
it, and I'm really glad we did, because like
you mentioned, the show was way better than

154
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:11,619
I thought it would be, and it's definitely a
far cry from the character that we've seen

155
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:16,262
on the big screen for the past decade, I would
say. When My Adventures with Superman was first

156
00:14:16,342 --> 00:14:21,264
announced in early 2021, based off the title,
I was under the impression that it was a series

157
00:14:21,284 --> 00:14:26,585
that focused on Lois Lane specifically, and
you know, like her perspective regarding Superman

158
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:32,267
and life in Metropolis. Right away, I assumed
I wasn't the target demographic, and you know,

159
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:36,888
I'd probably watch it with my daughters, but
probably wouldn't enjoy it. I was totally wrong.

160
00:14:37,228 --> 00:14:42,350
I enjoyed the shit out of the show, because
I forgot how much I could relate. to the romantic

161
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:46,932
side of the Superman story, which is an element
that has been there since the very beginning

162
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:53,215
of the character's introduction since 1938.
Jerry Siegel, one of the creators of Superman,

163
00:14:53,655 --> 00:14:58,958
said that one of the inspirations for Clark
Kent as an alter ego was because he had crushes

164
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:04,500
on girls who didn't even know he existed, and
he thought to himself, what if, secretly, he

165
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:10,023
was really great? What if he was super? The
love triangle of sorts that stemmed from Clark

166
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:16,446
Kent loving Lois Lane, but Lois Lane loving
Superman, was this tragic component that allowed

167
00:15:16,486 --> 00:15:21,848
readers to connect with these otherwise perfect
characters. And it's a component that was noticeably

168
00:15:21,928 --> 00:15:26,891
lacking in Zack Snyder's take on the character,
or from any other medium other than maybe Smallville

169
00:15:26,911 --> 00:15:32,613
for decades. I would argue that this show nails
the romantic aspect between Superman and Lois

170
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:38,302
than any film or television series in history
because of the novel approach they take with

171
00:15:38,342 --> 00:15:44,728
the Clark Kent alter ego. His awkwardness in
this show isn't necessarily an act like it

172
00:15:44,768 --> 00:15:49,052
was for the Christopher Reeve version of the
character. It's often been debated amongst

173
00:15:49,132 --> 00:15:55,057
comic readers whether Clark Kent should be an
act, and in this show we see that Clark Kent

174
00:15:55,117 --> 00:16:00,702
and Superman are essentially the same person.
It's just that Clark Kent is clumsy, due to

175
00:16:00,722 --> 00:16:06,106
having to control and hide his powers at all
times, which is difficult to do when his attention

176
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:12,771
is on a pretty girl like Lois. I'm not usually
one for romantic media, I'll admit that. I

177
00:16:12,811 --> 00:16:21,558
think my tastes as a hyper-masculine dude is
pretty much in the vein of, you know, I like

178
00:16:21,598 --> 00:16:25,861
to see the action aspect of these superheroes.
The romantic side never really interested me.

179
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:31,088
But You know, I think that Superman actually
has one of the most interesting romantic angles

180
00:16:31,148 --> 00:16:36,432
out of all superheroes in general. Yeah, I mean,
his romantic relationships, and I guess not

181
00:16:36,472 --> 00:16:41,254
just that, his relationships in general are
the source of his vulnerability, right? And

182
00:16:41,314 --> 00:16:45,837
plus, like, Superman's really only loved one
girl for the most part. I think he's had some

183
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:51,180
a few other romantic interests in his history,
but for the most part, Lois is Superman's girl

184
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,103
ever since the 1940s, you know. Whereas I think
most other male superheroes have quite a number

185
00:16:56,143 --> 00:17:01,347
of romantic interests, like another prime example
is Spider-Man, but he's had Gwen Stacy, Mary

186
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:07,350
Jane, Felicia Hardy, you know? Spider-Man's
a ho! It's much more wholesome, I think, with

187
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,953
the Superman-Lowes relationship. Absolutely,
yeah. Now, there was a lot of length, but that

188
00:17:11,973 --> 00:17:16,096
was in high school. You know, since becoming
an adult, Superman is primarily a wood woman

189
00:17:16,116 --> 00:17:21,454
man. Now, the show is so well written. And the
chemistry between the characters of Superman

190
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:26,756
and Lois is so well realized that even though
Lois discovers Clark Kent as Superman less

191
00:17:26,776 --> 00:17:31,977
than halfway through the series, it doesn't
ruin the dramatic flow and tension between

192
00:17:32,017 --> 00:17:37,179
the characters. And it even helps address a
criticism many have levied at the writers of

193
00:17:37,219 --> 00:17:42,640
Lois Lane for decades in that if she's such
an intelligent investigative journalist, why

194
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:49,438
didn't she deduce that Clark Kent was Superman
early on? Here, she does. and in a more believable

195
00:17:49,518 --> 00:17:55,161
and natural way than, say, Amy Adams' version
of the character. The way the showrunners approached

196
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:59,983
the relationship between Clark and Lois wasn't
the only novel aspect of the show, however,

197
00:18:00,403 --> 00:18:06,486
the most blatant being the anime animation style.
We saw shades of the anime style in the DC

198
00:18:06,546 --> 00:18:10,648
animated movie universe that began with the
Justice League the Flashpoint Paradox animated

199
00:18:10,688 --> 00:18:16,495
film, but My Adventures with Superman is, for
the most part, a shounen anime in terms of

200
00:18:16,535 --> 00:18:22,179
both animation and story style. Shounen animes
are geared toward teenage boys and include

201
00:18:22,239 --> 00:18:28,764
tropes such as growing in power like leveling
up, having a romantic rival, themes of teamwork,

202
00:18:28,804 --> 00:18:34,047
and the power of friendship, many of which are
found in this show. I love that for almost

203
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:38,751
every villain that Superman went up against,
Lois and Jimmy were on the sidelines figuring

204
00:18:38,811 --> 00:18:43,290
out how to help Superman, whether it was pushing
buttons on a crate or- you know, finding the

205
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:48,514
off switch for a high tech panic room. Yeah,
the anime art style was pretty well done here.

206
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:53,597
I never knew how well suited the character of
Superman was to the anime style until I saw

207
00:18:53,798 --> 00:18:58,681
it, and it works really damn well. Yeah, there's
a lot of visual anime tropes on the show as

208
00:18:58,741 --> 00:19:05,206
well. You know, such as Superman sparking with
electricity like Goku or the Majoko style transformation

209
00:19:05,506 --> 00:19:10,229
into a super suit. The teaser for the next episode
at the very end of the one you're watching.

210
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:15,947
And you know, overall the fast action and exaggerated
facial expressions. I don't watch a lot of

211
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:22,249
anime, but I do know that some of my favorites,
like Neon Genesis Evangelion, My Hero Academia

212
00:19:22,569 --> 00:19:27,951
and Sword Art Online, would be considered shounen.
And recognizing some of those anime tropes,

213
00:19:28,071 --> 00:19:33,332
both story and visual, was part of the fun of
watching the show. I never would have thought

214
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:38,558
like you that Superman would have worked in
that style. But he totally did. For sure. And

215
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:43,160
going back to the romantic angle, I think for
some reason, the anime art style does a really

216
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:49,062
good job of expressing that sort of like shy,
flirtatious behavior between characters. Yeah.

217
00:19:49,262 --> 00:19:53,264
You know, with like the blush cheeks and everything
like that, it just worked really well in selling

218
00:19:53,484 --> 00:19:58,266
their romantic back and forth in an endearing
way. Yeah, totally. Japanese shounen don't

219
00:19:58,286 --> 00:20:03,788
really shy away from romance in the same way
that I think Western cartoons geared towards

220
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:11,270
young men do. It was like, oh, they love each
other. I was like, he likes her, oh no. No,

221
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:17,912
my daughter loved this series as well. She's
12 years old. She's in middle school. She watched

222
00:20:17,972 --> 00:20:22,714
the new episodes before I did. She was like
really into it. Girls love anime, I found.

223
00:20:22,914 --> 00:20:27,035
Yeah. And I think a large part of it has to
do with, yeah, they don't shy away from things

224
00:20:27,055 --> 00:20:32,696
like romance. Now, as a Superman fan, one of
the things I loved most about this show was

225
00:20:32,716 --> 00:20:37,782
the approach it took with Superman's origin
and how it resulted week to week. and a who's

226
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:43,764
who of supervillains from DC Comics. In a similar
way to how Kryptonite was responsible for creating

227
00:20:43,904 --> 00:20:49,147
many of Superman's villains in the Smallville
television series, in this show, many of them

228
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:54,449
are powered by repurposed Kryptonian technology.
Superman doesn't realize this until the very

229
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:59,731
end of the season, so he doesn't have that same
guilt that Clark did in Smallville, but I'm

230
00:20:59,751 --> 00:21:04,173
sure that's coming next season. Some people
got tired of the Kryptonite villain of the

231
00:21:04,193 --> 00:21:09,159
week, Shtick, from Smallville. But since my
adventures with Superman was only 10 episodes,

232
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:14,520
I didn't feel that aspect overstayed its welcome.
And it helped story-wise in coming up with

233
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:19,682
a simple solution for why all of these superpowered
beings emerged for Superman to fight. We got

234
00:21:19,722 --> 00:21:27,864
to see Livewire, Silver Banshee, Mist, Rough
House, Dr. Ivo, Parasite, Heatwave, Deathstroke,

235
00:21:28,164 --> 00:21:34,943
Mixi Spidlic, Amanda Waller, Lex Luthor, Omac
Robots, General Lane and even Matsumura Mala

236
00:21:35,023 --> 00:21:41,168
and the Brain. At the very end, we even get
teases of Brainiac and Zod. None of these characters

237
00:21:41,428 --> 00:21:47,713
get much character development and it shouldn't
work because of that, but it somehow does because

238
00:21:47,793 --> 00:21:53,537
of the way all of the villains get their powers
and because the show is so focused on Superman

239
00:21:53,617 --> 00:21:59,641
and his friends. Yeah, I think the tech aspect
goes a long way in making the show feel modern.

240
00:21:59,974 --> 00:22:04,195
as well. A lot of the bad guys almost seem like
Iron Man or something like that, you know?

241
00:22:04,896 --> 00:22:10,438
But it doesn't feel untrue to the characters
themselves. Like Livewire, I think she was

242
00:22:10,498 --> 00:22:17,441
actually a villain introduced in the Superman
animated series from the 90s. But her origin

243
00:22:17,501 --> 00:22:20,842
here I think is actually better than the one
they introduced in that old cartoon. And you're

244
00:22:20,862 --> 00:22:25,484
right, it was fun going like, oh, that's Livewire.
Oh, that's Deathstroke. It's funny how like,

245
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:29,362
I was so ready to write off the show in the
beginning. Because I thought that was lame.

246
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:32,623
I was like, what the fuck are they doing? Like
reinventing all these characters. And I was

247
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:37,245
like, this is just some else world's bullshit.
But by the end I was like, man, this would

248
00:22:37,305 --> 00:22:43,408
be a great angle for a film adaptation, honestly.
Oh man, don't even get me started. Like I liked

249
00:22:43,468 --> 00:22:48,170
this show so much that it actually got me a
little depressed by how good it was. Because

250
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:54,073
like most DC animations, I don't understand
why Warner Brothers couldn't adapt this approach

251
00:22:54,153 --> 00:22:59,663
for live action, you know? Like each of these
episodes were only 22 minutes long. This could

252
00:22:59,683 --> 00:23:04,265
have easily been a pair of films, maybe even
a trilogy. And that would have been amazing.

253
00:23:04,685 --> 00:23:09,927
Like whatever James Gunn is doing with the Superman
legacy film, the bar has been set for how well

254
00:23:09,947 --> 00:23:15,350
you could introduce Superman already right now.
It does have its work cut out for it in telling

255
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:20,532
Superman's early years better than this show
did. Right. Exactly. And it's been said that,

256
00:23:20,612 --> 00:23:26,099
you know, it's not focusing on Superman's early
years as Superman. but it is supposed to focus

257
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:31,283
on his early years in Metropolis with Lois Lane
and stuff like that. So, I don't know. Maybe

258
00:23:31,323 --> 00:23:36,267
he could go like the Superman birthright route
in that regard, but we'll see, I guess. For

259
00:23:36,327 --> 00:23:41,352
my money, this was a better modern adaptation
of the character of Superman than the Man of

260
00:23:41,412 --> 00:23:47,217
Steel movie, which I thought was an interesting,
you know, alien sci-fi approach to the character.

261
00:23:47,657 --> 00:23:52,781
You know, I love Man of Steel. It's one of my
favorite DC movies, and I would agree with

262
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:59,101
you. That's why I'm depressed. But moving on
to the character breakdown, there's really

263
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:04,764
only three main characters to talk about. Of
course, starting with Superman, aka Clark Kent,

264
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:10,487
he was voiced by Jack Quaid, who's the son of
Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid, and is probably

265
00:24:10,547 --> 00:24:16,211
best well known for playing Huey and the boys.
It's a lighter, more comedic take on Superman,

266
00:24:16,571 --> 00:24:22,034
but I thought Jack nailed this version of the
character. I've never heard or seen- Superman

267
00:24:22,114 --> 00:24:27,037
to be this expressive on screen. Oh, he was
incredible. I didn't even know that was him,

268
00:24:27,097 --> 00:24:30,658
and now I'm kind of blown away by that. Yeah,
yeah, I didn't realize it was him either. He's

269
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:36,962
pretty talented. Now, the show asks numerous
times, who is Superman? Superman asks himself

270
00:24:36,982 --> 00:24:42,025
that question. As we see each of Superman's
powers activate during the course of the show,

271
00:24:42,505 --> 00:24:49,169
he learns that he's a hero who simply does what
he can to help others. A good example of this

272
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:53,863
is when he steps in front of Lois. to shield
her from a barrage of lasers without thinking,

273
00:24:54,103 --> 00:24:59,625
without even knowing that he was invulnerable
to them. Superman being a hero isn't the most

274
00:24:59,726 --> 00:25:04,888
shocking answer to the question of who he is.
The bigger shock comes from the angle they

275
00:25:04,928 --> 00:25:11,051
took in showing us that not only are some supermen
across the multiverse seemingly evil, but they

276
00:25:11,131 --> 00:25:13,312
also make us believe for a time that

277
00:25:17,406 --> 00:25:21,309
Yeah, there's an aspect to the show that was
kind of reminiscent of the invincible comic

278
00:25:21,349 --> 00:25:25,953
book series and animated show on Amazon, where
they portrayed the Kryptonians almost like

279
00:25:25,993 --> 00:25:30,997
Viltrumites, where like they're these super
powerful beings. And I think Jor-El in this

280
00:25:31,037 --> 00:25:36,862
show can almost be seen as an analog to invincible's
father Omniman. I thought that was really fascinating,

281
00:25:37,362 --> 00:25:41,666
even though we know that Jor-El is ultimately
going to be a good guy. But then you have Zod

282
00:25:41,686 --> 00:25:47,071
at the end. Right. Yeah, so cool. I can't wait
for season two. And I think that's a testament

283
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:52,235
to just how good this show is. I spoke earlier
about how like this show does a better job

284
00:25:52,316 --> 00:25:57,020
of bringing the character into modern times
while making him feel like Superman. Yes, like

285
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:02,445
a young classic version of Superman in the modern
day. And they never thought that they would

286
00:26:02,465 --> 00:26:07,410
be able to do that as successfully as they did
here. I think that's really why I was so happy

287
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:12,742
with the show by the end of it, because it proved
that it could be done. Right. Like Henry Cavill's

288
00:26:12,842 --> 00:26:17,305
Superman was a little bit dark for some people's
tastes. He was a little bit brooding. You cannot

289
00:26:17,345 --> 00:26:23,109
say that about this animated version of Superman.
Should have been live action. Damn it. Moving

290
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:28,973
on to Lois Lane, she was voiced by Alice Lee,
a singer and actress from Zoe's Extraordinary

291
00:26:29,013 --> 00:26:35,017
Playlist and never saw the show. Alice is of
Korean descent and her version of Lois Lane

292
00:26:35,518 --> 00:26:39,801
is also of Korean descent. And I believe this
is the first time we've ever seen the character

293
00:26:39,881 --> 00:26:44,583
depicted that way. And I don't mind it. You
know, they also race-bent Jimmy Olsen to match

294
00:26:44,683 --> 00:26:49,885
his voice actor. We'll talk about that character
in a bit. But I think matching the ethnicity

295
00:26:49,945 --> 00:26:55,628
of the voice actor best suited for the role
is admirable. And I have to say, I loved the

296
00:26:55,648 --> 00:27:00,610
voice work for Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen. Oh
yeah, they did a perfect job. Now Lois's arc

297
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:05,772
really revolves around her relationship with
her father. She disdains him for keeping secrets

298
00:27:05,812 --> 00:27:10,902
from her growing up about his classified work
and her mother's cancer. and she struggles

299
00:27:10,942 --> 00:27:16,926
to find success in part due to feelings of neglect
from him ignoring her growing up. I think it

300
00:27:16,966 --> 00:27:21,449
was brilliant that they made her father, General
Lane, the primary villain. I thought it was

301
00:27:21,489 --> 00:27:26,993
going to be like Lex Luthor or maybe Brainiac,
but having it be General Lane added a whole

302
00:27:27,093 --> 00:27:32,857
other layer of conflict to the relationship
between Superman and Lois. I mean, who didn't

303
00:27:32,897 --> 00:27:37,800
see that coming, but also, yeah, brilliant idea.
I mean, I didn't initially until we actually

304
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:44,232
saw him. I was like, oh shit. Nice. I did kind
of roll my eyes when we learned that there

305
00:27:44,252 --> 00:27:49,336
was a multiversal league of Lois Lanes because
we've seen that done so many times by this

306
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:56,260
point, like Council of Ricks, Council of Reed
Richards, you know. But after a while, I realized

307
00:27:56,341 --> 00:28:01,384
it was a clever way to not only add further
tension to Superman and Lois's relationship

308
00:28:01,584 --> 00:28:06,788
and introduce Kryptonite, but also to qualm
any haters who may have an issue with this

309
00:28:06,848 --> 00:28:12,214
adaptation of the world of Superman or even
like the race bending by saying that this is

310
00:28:12,275 --> 00:28:18,357
its own thing. It's its own world. Your classic
Superman world still exists, but this is our

311
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:23,979
interpretation and our stamp. There's a little
bit of the manic pixie dream girl characterization

312
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:29,321
here, especially in the early episodes for Lois
Lane. But Lois Lane is kind of like the OG

313
00:28:29,401 --> 00:28:35,424
manic pixie dream girl. She's always been this
like borderline insane woman who will always

314
00:28:35,484 --> 00:28:39,325
be impulsive and go out and do the dangerous
thing. Right. And that's also an anime trope.

315
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:43,951
you know, the wild impulsive anime girl. And
I really liked how they kind of blended that

316
00:28:43,971 --> 00:28:49,093
characterization into this version of Lois Lane.
For sure. Yeah, she was really well done. As

317
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:54,836
was Jimmy Olsen. He was voiced by Ishmael Saheed.
And I have to say, I haven't enjoyed Jimmy

318
00:28:54,916 --> 00:29:01,399
Olsen this much in a long while. It's always
been hard to sincerely say that Jimmy Olsen

319
00:29:01,499 --> 00:29:06,561
is Superman's best pal in the comics, because
he's always been like this dimwitted and somewhat

320
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:12,909
annoying peon of sorts. But here they made Clark
and Jimmy bros, like equals, who were friends

321
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:18,613
even before they arrived at the Daily Planet.
And on top of that, they made Jimmy a conspiracy

322
00:29:18,653 --> 00:29:24,918
theorist vlogger, which was a brilliant way
to add tension to him and Clark. Yeah, at first

323
00:29:24,958 --> 00:29:30,162
I thought it was just like this random character
trait that was done for... Comedic Relief and

324
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:34,806
I was prepared to be really annoyed by Jimmy
Olsen actually. And then I kind of saw how

325
00:29:34,826 --> 00:29:39,129
all the pieces fell together as Clark always
found himself nervous around Jimmy because

326
00:29:39,229 --> 00:29:43,051
Clark is an alien, you know? Right. So it was
pretty interesting. Again, you know, there's

327
00:29:43,111 --> 00:29:47,834
an anime trope of like the Comedic Relief character
that this version of Jimmy Olsen fell squarely

328
00:29:47,894 --> 00:29:53,838
into. But the way that the show was able to
fill those molds while still staying true to

329
00:29:53,878 --> 00:29:59,750
the Superman mythos was just brilliant. Yeah.
I mean, tropes and cliches. exist for a reason,

330
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:04,733
and when they're well done, they're really well
done. Now I don't know how I feel about the

331
00:30:04,793 --> 00:30:10,616
reveal that Jimmy recognized that Clark was
an alien early on as roommates, but I guess

332
00:30:10,656 --> 00:30:16,059
it makes sense considering they were living
together, and it also shows how true of a friend

333
00:30:16,139 --> 00:30:23,083
Jimmy was in that as a vlogger about aliens,
he wouldn't expose Clark as one. Like, if that

334
00:30:23,123 --> 00:30:28,554
isn't the sign of a true friend, I don't know
what is. My impression is that It was his realization

335
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:34,238
that Clark was like a super strong alien guy
that manifested his whole conspiratorial nature

336
00:30:34,258 --> 00:30:39,682
to begin with. Oh interesting, maybe. He's like,
holy crap this guy's like superhuman, the fantastical

337
00:30:39,702 --> 00:30:44,505
must exist and I must learn all about it. I
love that, that's great. Let's move on to the

338
00:30:44,545 --> 00:30:45,385
story highlights.

339
00:30:53,046 --> 00:30:58,507
In episode 1, titled Adventures of a Normal
Man, part 1, in Smallville, Kansas, a young

340
00:30:58,587 --> 00:31:04,009
Clark Kent awakens the power of flight and strength
to save a woman and her baby from a car accident.

341
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:10,190
Years later, in Metropolis, Clark and his roommate
Jimmy Olsen, a photography student and alien

342
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:16,232
conspiracy theorist, start their first day as
interns for the Daily Planet. Assigned to senior

343
00:31:16,312 --> 00:31:21,533
intern Lois Lane, she deceives them into helping
her investigate a military-grade technology

344
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:27,236
theft. With a lead from Flip Johnson's News
Kid Legion, the trio finds the thieves loading

345
00:31:27,316 --> 00:31:33,860
military robots at the docks. The thieves' leader,
Leslie Willis, unleashes a robot to attack

346
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:39,684
them. Clark gets out of view and returns in
disguise to destroy it. As Willis activates

347
00:31:39,724 --> 00:31:45,587
the remaining robots to battle Clark, Lois successfully
deactivates them while he awakens his super

348
00:31:45,647 --> 00:31:51,799
speed to destroy the final robot. Despite their
efforts, Editor-in-Chief Perry White refuses

349
00:31:51,819 --> 00:31:57,583
to publish the story based on Jimmy's blurry
photos without real proof of the new metahuman

350
00:31:57,623 --> 00:32:03,327
that Lois dubbed Superman. Once the trio become
friends, Lois invites the boys to help her

351
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:09,251
get an exclusive interview with Superman. Now,
I'll admit this first episode I did not love

352
00:32:09,491 --> 00:32:15,075
when it came to the wacky, you know, Jimmy Olsen
hijinks, the manic characterization of Lois,

353
00:32:15,195 --> 00:32:20,410
and like the kids' newspaper brigade or whatever.
I was like, God. I didn't... why are we reviewing

354
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:25,273
this? Like, I would have rather have reviewed
the live-action Superman and Lois television

355
00:32:25,293 --> 00:32:28,615
series is what I thought to myself. Or something
like that, you know? Because I've heard that's

356
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:33,998
good. But to the show's credit, as the show
progresses, it gets more serious along the

357
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:39,241
way. Which I think resulted in nice growth for
the characters. Yeah, true. Like you, I wasn't

358
00:32:39,481 --> 00:32:43,923
thrilled by this first episode. Like, I didn't
think it was the greatest adaptation ever for

359
00:32:43,943 --> 00:32:49,686
Superman. I didn't really feel that way until
maybe episode three or four. But episode 2

360
00:32:49,706 --> 00:32:55,450
was pretty good. That was titled Adventures
of a Normal Man, part 2. While Lois doggedly

361
00:32:55,490 --> 00:33:01,094
follows up on the robot theft for a lead to
Superman, Clark returns to Smallville to investigate

362
00:33:01,134 --> 00:33:06,798
his past and understand his new powers. Digging
up the space pod that delivered him to Earth,

363
00:33:07,158 --> 00:33:13,763
Clark activates an alien hologram and sees visions
of an alien planet amid a space war being destroyed.

364
00:33:14,263 --> 00:33:20,319
After Clark gains new alien clothing from this,
His mother, Martha, adds a belt and shorts

365
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:26,301
to complete the look. Meanwhile, Willis is hunted
by the organization she stole the robot technology

366
00:33:26,361 --> 00:33:33,305
from, Task Force X, and arranges a meeting with
leading agent Slade Wilson, aka Deathstroke.

367
00:33:33,785 --> 00:33:38,227
When Willis threatens to detonate explosives
across the city sewers if they continue hunting

368
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:44,546
her, Lois and Jimmy's surprise interruption
turns the meeting into a scramble for the Willis

369
00:33:44,606 --> 00:33:50,747
reveals her electrical super suit to fight Deathstroke
until Superman arrives to subdue her. Deathstroke

370
00:33:50,787 --> 00:33:56,689
damages her suit's power crystal, leading Superman
to destroy it after it gives him another vision

371
00:33:56,749 --> 00:34:02,451
of the space war. Though Jimmy's clear photos
convince Perry to publish the story, he gives

372
00:34:02,491 --> 00:34:09,873
the byline to uninvolved staff reporters. Later,
Deathstroke tortures Willis, now Livewire,

373
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:16,383
at a black site for information about Superman.
I've seen a lot of flack online for the transformation

374
00:34:16,423 --> 00:34:20,806
scene in this episode, and I really feel like
early on when the show's first episodes were

375
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:26,730
coming out, there was a lot of antagonism towards
it. But I am happy to see more and more people

376
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:31,433
admit that they liked the series online. Well,
I mean, it just made sense for the context

377
00:34:31,813 --> 00:34:36,356
of the scene, right? Clark activating the ship
for the first time and going down into it and

378
00:34:36,396 --> 00:34:41,679
seeing partial visions of the Kryptonian story.
and getting a suit from that, I think, worked

379
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:46,842
really well. And yeah, it's kind of a funny
anime cliche for the characters to suit up

380
00:34:46,982 --> 00:34:51,944
in this overtly grandiose fashion. But considering
it only happened once in the season and it

381
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:55,646
had that context to go with it, I thought it
was spot on. Yeah, I don't even think it was

382
00:34:55,666 --> 00:35:00,949
that over the top either. It literally only
lasted five seconds, maybe not even that long.

383
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:05,832
Yeah, I do love the fact that Martha helped
contribute to the suit in some way, because

384
00:35:05,852 --> 00:35:10,034
in the comics she did. You know, she helped
him make it and design it. Yeah. So that was

385
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:15,378
cool. It really only took me up until this episode
to start getting into the show. Once you kind

386
00:35:15,418 --> 00:35:20,081
of saw what they did with LiveWire, something
kind of like clicked for me and I understood

387
00:35:20,181 --> 00:35:25,665
what they were going with in terms of bringing
in the larger DC universe. Right, yeah. We've

388
00:35:25,705 --> 00:35:31,430
begun to episode three titled, My Interview
with Superman. While Lois attempts to interview

389
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:36,733
Superman, Clark struggles to figure out how
to help her while protecting his secret identity.

390
00:35:37,282 --> 00:35:41,884
However, the interns must also contend with
the Daily Planet's established Scoop Troop

391
00:35:41,964 --> 00:35:48,007
reporters, who perry-credited for their Superman
story. Specifically, Steve Lombard, Kent Grant,

392
00:35:48,348 --> 00:35:53,591
and Ronnie Troop. Meanwhile, Myst and his friend
Ruff House use technology they obtained from

393
00:35:53,671 --> 00:35:59,234
Livewire to break his sister, Chauvan McDougal,
out of prison and equip her with sonic tech

394
00:35:59,274 --> 00:36:05,117
to rebuild their small time crew, Intergang.
Despite Clark's misgivings, the interns impersonate

395
00:36:05,157 --> 00:36:10,728
the Scoop Troop to investigate Chauvin, now
Silver Banshee, discovering a clue to Intergang's

396
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:16,491
next heist. When Intergang attempts to rob the
Metropolitan City Bank, their ice cannon's

397
00:36:16,531 --> 00:36:21,934
power crystal malfunctions and begins to freeze
everything in proximity. Seeing Lois and Jimmy

398
00:36:21,954 --> 00:36:27,797
in danger, Superman awakens his heat vision
and destroys the crystal, granting him a vision

399
00:36:28,198 --> 00:36:34,041
of an invading robot army. While Deathstroke's
organization secretly takes the defeated Intergang

400
00:36:34,101 --> 00:36:40,549
members into Superman accepts Lois' interview
and discloses that he is still figuring himself

401
00:36:40,729 --> 00:36:46,994
out, but is committed to saving people. However,
to his dismay, Lois later tells Clark that

402
00:36:47,014 --> 00:36:52,858
she suspects Superman is lying. Now, when I
first saw Intergang pop up here, I was guessing

403
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:57,322
that the main villain was going to be Darkseid
and that this was apocalyptic tech, but that

404
00:36:57,342 --> 00:37:02,946
turned out to not be the case. Right, because
traditionally, Intergang is supplied with new

405
00:37:02,986 --> 00:37:07,028
God technology, right? I do like the way they
kind of flipped it here so that it was Kryptonian

406
00:37:07,068 --> 00:37:11,370
tech, though. I think it still worked. Yeah,
I agree. I also think it's interesting how

407
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:18,935
crystals power Kryptonian tech. You know, Sunstone
is a thing in the comics. We saw that in the

408
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:24,458
Superman movie as well, where like all the architecture
and stuff is created from crystals. So it was

409
00:37:24,478 --> 00:37:30,361
nice that they found a way to incorporate crystals
and even kryptonite as a crystal into Superman's

410
00:37:30,421 --> 00:37:35,621
mythos. Yeah, when Superman destroyed the ice
crystal with his heat vision, that's when I

411
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:41,645
recognized the shonen tropes of him like leveling
up to face new challenges throughout the course

412
00:37:41,705 --> 00:37:46,588
of each episode. I thought that was really neat.
It's really interesting. It's still not entirely

413
00:37:46,628 --> 00:37:52,252
clear how his new powers were unlocked. He kind
of just like sparked with electricity and then

414
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:56,736
boom, had a new power. But I thought it was
cool and I thought it worked. I have a feeling

415
00:37:56,836 --> 00:38:01,643
maybe Jor-El was kind of keeping tabs on his
son. and would unlock new powers as he needed

416
00:38:01,683 --> 00:38:07,768
them. Episode four was titled, Let's Go to Ivo
Tower, You Say. Perry assigns the interns to

417
00:38:07,808 --> 00:38:15,434
cover the Amazotech Gala held by CEO Dr. Anthony
Ivo. Lois is snubbed by the attendees for her

418
00:38:15,494 --> 00:38:21,319
invasive questions, while Clark stumbles upon
an argument between Ivo and his chairman, Curtis,

419
00:38:21,619 --> 00:38:27,664
regarding the board of directors voting out
Ivo. Ejected by Ivo's security, Lois sneaks

420
00:38:27,704 --> 00:38:33,351
Clark back inside. They open up to each other
before discovering a secret room with technology

421
00:38:33,611 --> 00:38:39,992
that connects Ivo to Livewire and Intergang.
An angered Ivo demonstrates the Parasite 1.0

422
00:38:40,133 --> 00:38:45,954
armor and attempts to kill Chairman Curtis.
Clark becomes Superman to save Curtis, while

423
00:38:46,134 --> 00:38:51,776
Ivo traps the attendees in the Amazo Panic Room
to make them witness him overpowering Superman.

424
00:38:52,196 --> 00:38:57,837
Realizing the armor absorbs energy from his
attacks, Superman stops fighting Ivo directly,

425
00:38:58,238 --> 00:39:03,560
as Lois and Jimmy deactivate the panic room.
With the suit depowered, Superman removes it

426
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:09,982
from Ivo, who became deformed due to the suit's
side effects. With Ivo under EMT care, the

427
00:39:10,042 --> 00:39:15,545
interns return to find the secret room empty.
Lois kisses Clark, considering the night a

428
00:39:15,605 --> 00:39:22,387
date night. Later, after submitting her expose
on Ivo, Lois finds a torn tabloid article involving

429
00:39:22,447 --> 00:39:28,810
Kansas' miracle sightings in Clark's coat. After
reworking her evidence board, Lois concludes

430
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:35,314
that Clark is Superman. Now, Ivo was the one
villain, I think, that they really didn't do

431
00:39:35,374 --> 00:39:41,017
justice, or I should say Parasite. Professor
Ivo in the comics, of course, is a mad scientist

432
00:39:41,057 --> 00:39:47,120
of sorts, who is responsible for the creation
of villainous robots such as Amazo. Parasite

433
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:52,283
is his own villain. For some reason, they decided
to merge the two here, and I really didn't

434
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:57,642
care for the character design. I don't understand
why it needed a tail, of all things. It was

435
00:39:57,682 --> 00:40:03,788
weird. Yeah, Parasite has never traditionally
been depicted as a tech- I mean, a lot of Superman's

436
00:40:03,828 --> 00:40:10,154
villains are not tech-based, although you could
rationalize a lot of their abilities as tech-oriented.

437
00:40:10,254 --> 00:40:15,759
Take, for example, Silver Banshee, which I thought
was well done. Parasite, I'm not quite so sure,

438
00:40:15,899 --> 00:40:20,344
successfully makes the transition over to tech-villain.
Although, you know, the whole power-draining

439
00:40:20,484 --> 00:40:27,049
aspect of it made sense for me, but- the weird
like tail and insectoid elements of the armor

440
00:40:27,189 --> 00:40:31,673
didn't quite make sense. I also thought that
they really played a little bit probably too

441
00:40:31,713 --> 00:40:38,819
heavily off of Tony Stark for Ivo making Kim
like this, you know, celebrity CEO on Playboy.

442
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:42,682
I don't know, I think they could have done a
better job, although I do appreciate the effort

443
00:40:42,782 --> 00:40:48,187
I suppose. By this episode with Alex making
an appearance, you know, Ivo's like scientist

444
00:40:48,227 --> 00:40:53,091
assistant, I totally thought that the main bad
guy the season was going to be Lex Luthor.

445
00:40:53,231 --> 00:40:58,435
What are your thoughts on the show kind of like
positioning Lex Luthor as more of a secondary

446
00:40:58,475 --> 00:41:04,681
villain type? I don't mind it, honestly. Like,
if you want to build up Lex Luthor as a major

447
00:41:04,741 --> 00:41:10,946
antagonist over a season or two, that's fine
by me. Like, give next season to General Zod,

448
00:41:11,266 --> 00:41:16,571
maybe have Lex Luthor help defeat him in some
way, but become bald in the process and then

449
00:41:16,611 --> 00:41:20,730
have him be like the main villain by season
three. That's, that's fine. Yeah, I think that

450
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:26,033
totally works. I assume that they're going to
have Alex take over his former boss's company,

451
00:41:26,253 --> 00:41:31,516
essentially. He's going to take over Amazotech
and turn it into LexCorp. Or LexTech, one of

452
00:41:31,536 --> 00:41:37,559
those. Episode five was titled, You Will Believe
a Man Can Lie. Hoping to confess his burgeoning

453
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:42,582
feelings for Lois, Clark asks for her help in
developing a story about the stolen military

454
00:41:42,622 --> 00:41:47,925
technology spreading throughout Metropolis and
a mysterious individual kidnapping anyone using

455
00:41:48,025 --> 00:41:53,782
it. However, she sees it as an opportunity to
expose him as Superman. Using an old dispatch

456
00:41:53,822 --> 00:41:59,286
scanner, she chases down Superman as he foils
various crimes before eventually meeting him

457
00:41:59,627 --> 00:42:05,372
after he defeats Heatwave, another criminal
empowered by the stolen technology. While Superman

458
00:42:05,412 --> 00:42:11,096
is distracted, Heatwave escapes, believing he
is behind recent kidnappings of Intergang members

459
00:42:11,357 --> 00:42:16,081
who have used the high-tech weaponry. After
Superman drops off Lois at the Daily Planet

460
00:42:16,121 --> 00:42:21,564
to keep her safe, He reconfronts Heatwave and
discovers the true culprit behind the abducted

461
00:42:21,604 --> 00:42:28,067
criminals is an armored Deathstroke aided by
similar robots that Livewire used. Their subsequent

462
00:42:28,147 --> 00:42:35,211
fight soon endangers civilians, leading to Deathstroke's
superiors, the General and Amanda Waller, ordering

463
00:42:35,251 --> 00:42:40,934
him to withdraw so Superman can save them. After
returning to Lois, she forces Clark to reveal

464
00:42:40,974 --> 00:42:44,156
his secret identity to her and is left distraught.

465
00:42:47,266 --> 00:42:52,247
that Clark and Lois fail to attend a pre-planned
camping trip to investigate Bigfoot sightings

466
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:57,888
with him. He goes alone, but a large gorilla
kidnaps him. I thought this was a pretty good

467
00:42:57,929 --> 00:43:03,130
episode, both action-wise and drama-wise. I
was actually surprised by the amount of drama

468
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:08,552
they were able to milk out of the whole Superman
Clark can't reveal to Lois Lane. Right. Yeah,

469
00:43:08,592 --> 00:43:14,213
this is one of my favorite episodes. There's
often criticism that, you know, Lois Lane should

470
00:43:14,273 --> 00:43:19,720
know that Superman... is Clark Kent because
Superman is just Clark Kent without glasses.

471
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:24,502
But I think this episode does a decent job of
sort of showing that Lewis doesn't really get

472
00:43:24,542 --> 00:43:30,406
the best looks at Superman. He's never around
enough for her to interact with him the way

473
00:43:30,426 --> 00:43:34,768
that she wants to. I mean, that all depends
on what version of Lewis you're talking about,

474
00:43:34,788 --> 00:43:38,851
though, because, like, if you look at Richard
Donner's movie, they had a whole like date

475
00:43:38,891 --> 00:43:42,953
night interviewed together. So she got a pretty
good look then. Margot Kidder should have known

476
00:43:42,993 --> 00:43:47,989
better. It's fair. Well, she did figure it out
in Superman 2 on her own. That's true. To be

477
00:43:48,029 --> 00:43:55,295
fair. Episode 6 was entitled, My Adventures
with Mad Science. After failing to locate Jimmy,

478
00:43:55,635 --> 00:44:01,660
Clark reaches out to Lois for help. Despite
still being mad at him, she agrees. Scouring

479
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:07,765
the woods, the pair find an abandoned military
installation called Area 52. But upon crossing

480
00:44:07,805 --> 00:44:14,422
the fence, Clark's powers falter due to the
area being exposed to red before they are chased

481
00:44:14,442 --> 00:44:22,268
by OMAC robots. Meanwhile, inside Area 52, Jimmy
meets and befriends the gorilla Matsumala and

482
00:44:22,308 --> 00:44:27,872
his partner, the Brain. The pair reveal they
originally worked for Project Cadmus, a branch

483
00:44:27,912 --> 00:44:33,676
of Task Force X that focused on developing futuristic
technology, before the latter organization

484
00:44:33,696 --> 00:44:39,561
betrayed them and raided Area 52. Ever since,
the Brain and Mala have been attempting to

485
00:44:39,601 --> 00:44:45,256
create a wormhole to access other dimensions
where they will be accepted. Eventually, breaching

486
00:44:45,376 --> 00:44:51,079
Area 52, Clark and Lois reconcile with each
other and Jimmy, who reveals he knew of Clark's

487
00:44:51,099 --> 00:44:57,042
secret identity all along, before joining Brain
and Mala in defeating the Omacs. Successfully

488
00:44:57,122 --> 00:45:02,886
opening their wormhole, the Brain warns Clark
that Task Force X is after him before leaving

489
00:45:02,946 --> 00:45:09,109
with Mala. Concurrently, the General recruits
Ivo to help him use Cadmus' technology to kill

490
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:15,483
Superman. This is one of the lesser episodes,
in my opinion, largely because of the characters

491
00:45:15,523 --> 00:45:19,845
of Munchier Mala and the brain. I know them
as Doom Patrol villains from the Brotherhood

492
00:45:19,885 --> 00:45:26,767
of Evil. Right. And they weren't very evil in
this reality. Well, no, I think a lot of the

493
00:45:26,827 --> 00:45:32,368
villains that were under the hands of Grant
Morrison were reinterpreted in a way that made

494
00:45:32,389 --> 00:45:37,910
them less evil than they were prior, I would
say. Like, you know, he's the one who made

495
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:43,332
Munsir Mala and the Brain lovers to begin with.
Which just struck me as really weird in this

496
00:45:43,372 --> 00:45:49,614
show. Yeah, especially considering that the
Brain was a scientist that helped give Munsir

497
00:45:49,634 --> 00:45:54,435
Mala the gorilla his genius. And then fell in
love with him, which seems like a weird case

498
00:45:54,455 --> 00:45:59,657
of bestiality going on. Like, was he fucking
that gorilla the whole time? I hope not. I

499
00:46:00,817 --> 00:46:04,534
don't know if we want to- He better not be.
Yeah, like I didn't feel like comfortable with

500
00:46:04,694 --> 00:46:10,197
some of the implications of this episode. There's
definitely like a breach of ethics there somewhere.

501
00:46:10,757 --> 00:46:15,419
Anyway, yeah, I didn't love what they did with
the Brain and Mansuramala. They're Doom Patrol

502
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:20,401
villains again, so I'm not sure why they were
here in this episode. There are other villains

503
00:46:20,441 --> 00:46:24,663
from Project Cadmus that I think could have
worked here just as well. Can you explain why

504
00:46:24,703 --> 00:46:30,025
the area was doused in red solar radiation?
Because I guess I didn't quite get that part.

505
00:46:30,602 --> 00:46:35,525
Or like why there were booby traps around as
the omacs were chasing Lois and Clark through

506
00:46:35,565 --> 00:46:40,808
the jungle. Well the booby traps were set up
to protect Mansuramala and the brain from Task

507
00:46:40,828 --> 00:46:47,252
Force X should they ever return to the base
of Area 52. I don't know what the red solar

508
00:46:47,292 --> 00:46:52,856
radiation thing was about, I also didn't catch
that. Again, I don't think it was a great episode

509
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:57,986
because of unexplained things like that. I did
think the OMAX were cool, and I was actually

510
00:46:58,026 --> 00:47:02,508
surprised to see them so soon after watching
Blue Beetle. Yeah, they're like everywhere

511
00:47:02,568 --> 00:47:09,651
now. Episode 7 was titled Kiss Fallen Portal.
After Clark shows Lois and Jimmy his spaceship

512
00:47:09,931 --> 00:47:16,154
and clarifies his incomplete alien origin, Clark
and Lois plan their first date. However, he

513
00:47:16,194 --> 00:47:21,616
is interrupted by Mr. Mixy Espitalik, a multiversal
imp who deceives him into helping him steal

514
00:47:21,716 --> 00:47:27,744
a recorder from a museum on Earth-1. revealing
Clark is from the planet Krypton in the process.

515
00:47:28,244 --> 00:47:32,988
Meanwhile, Lois and Jimmy are recruited by the
Multiversal League of Lois Lanes to help them

516
00:47:33,068 --> 00:47:38,713
stop Mixi-Spitalik and Clark. Suspicious of
their intentions, Lois searches their files,

517
00:47:38,833 --> 00:47:45,639
stumbling onto the redacted File X. Upon finding
them, the League attacks Clark, while Mixi-Spitalik

518
00:47:45,659 --> 00:47:51,123
hijacks the League's vessel and travels to their
headquarters with the Recorder and Lois' help.

519
00:47:51,524 --> 00:47:57,823
As she steals the original File X, Myxiospidulix
retrieves his hat, regains his full strength,

520
00:47:58,183 --> 00:48:04,286
and causes chaos until Superman distracts him,
allowing Lois to depower him and Jimmy to restrain

521
00:48:04,326 --> 00:48:10,428
him. While the League arrests Myxiospidulix,
Jimmy's counterpart, Jelana, secretly brings

522
00:48:10,448 --> 00:48:16,231
the interns back to their native Earth-12, where
Clark and Lois finish their date. Following

523
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:22,333
this, she opens File X and finds recordings
of evil alternate universe Superman and a sample

524
00:48:22,373 --> 00:48:27,779
of Kryptonite. that the League used to injure
him. I actually really like this interpretation

525
00:48:28,279 --> 00:48:32,620
of Myxias Spedulic, and I never know if I'm
pronouncing that correctly. Well, that's how

526
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,682
they pronounced it in the show. Yeah, it was
very different from other iterations of the

527
00:48:36,702 --> 00:48:40,823
character that I've seen. Typically he's portrayed
as like this impish looking character, but

528
00:48:40,943 --> 00:48:47,045
here he definitely had like mystic alien influences.
I thought he was more like a feline genie,

529
00:48:47,085 --> 00:48:51,912
which kind of made sense to me. Considering
that fifth dimensional imps in DC comics are

530
00:48:51,972 --> 00:48:57,255
often interpreted as genies like the Thunderbolt
I liked it the hat didn't make sense, but I

531
00:48:57,275 --> 00:49:02,219
liked it No, yeah, and the fact that he got
his powers from his hat I thought was a little

532
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:07,683
bit convenient But no there were a lot of great
references in this episode to alternate animated

533
00:49:07,763 --> 00:49:12,326
universe Superman that I appreciated I don't
think you guys power from his hat. I just think

534
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:20,415
he wasn't whole without his hat. Okay. Yeah
episode 8 was titled Zero Day Part 1. The General

535
00:49:20,515 --> 00:49:26,740
uses shock collars to forcibly recruit Livewire,
Intergang, and Heatwave into assisting Deathstroke

536
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:33,004
and Ivo in capturing Superman. Meanwhile, after
developing Superhearing and sensing everyone

537
00:49:33,024 --> 00:49:38,428
in the city crying for help, Clark runs himself
ragged helping everyone and soon becomes sleep

538
00:49:38,448 --> 00:49:44,132
deprived and weakened. When Gotham Gazette journalist
Vicki Vale arrives to cover his activities,

539
00:49:44,312 --> 00:49:50,747
Lois is starstruck to meet her. only to be disappointed
when Vail runs a biased story defaming Superman

540
00:49:50,927 --> 00:49:56,030
as a menace to gain a promotion. Superman saves
an invisible Mist from being hit by a truck,

541
00:49:56,350 --> 00:50:02,212
but causes an accident, turning public opinion
against him. Mist says Task Force X kidnapped

542
00:50:02,252 --> 00:50:07,755
Silver Banshee, and Superman offers to rescue
her, only to be led into a trap and attacked

543
00:50:07,815 --> 00:50:12,857
by the group. Though he holds his own despite
his weakened state, Superman is eventually

544
00:50:12,877 --> 00:50:19,572
knocked out by Ivo, via his upgraded parasite
armor and livewire. The General stops Ivo from

545
00:50:19,612 --> 00:50:24,774
killing Superman as he wants to interrogate
him, Mr. Egress luring Superman into the trap

546
00:50:25,134 --> 00:50:30,457
as Lois and Jimmy rush to the scene but arrive
to see the group carry Superman away. And this

547
00:50:30,477 --> 00:50:34,819
was cool, like this was a way to introduce the
Suicide Squad without actually naming them

548
00:50:34,939 --> 00:50:39,741
as such. Just repurposing all of the villains
that they showcased throughout the season,

549
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:44,083
I thought was pretty well done. Yeah, and seeing
Superman going up against all of them was a

550
00:50:44,123 --> 00:50:48,486
lot of fun to watch. It's like that video game
that's never coming out. Suicide Squad killed

551
00:50:48,506 --> 00:50:54,149
the Justice League. Right, right. The angle
they took for this episode where his super

552
00:50:54,189 --> 00:50:59,232
hearing kind of creates this vulnerability in
that he struggles with being everywhere at

553
00:50:59,392 --> 00:51:04,915
once and therefore doesn't sleep and therefore
is less effective playing upon people's fears

554
00:51:04,955 --> 00:51:10,531
that are being stirred by this new biased reporter.
It all works really well together. The show

555
00:51:10,591 --> 00:51:15,815
can be really well written at times. Most times,
I would say. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. Episode nine

556
00:51:15,835 --> 00:51:22,160
was Zero Day, part two. In flashbacks to Zero
Day, the general, Waller and their forces were

557
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:28,584
attacked by an alien army led by a Superman
like figure codenamed Nemesis Omega before

558
00:51:28,604 --> 00:51:34,209
a mysterious event forced the army back into
a retreat that left their technology behind.

559
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:39,608
In the present. The News Kid Legion helps Lois
and Jimmy search for Superman, while the General

560
00:51:39,688 --> 00:51:45,791
interrogates him for information on Zero Day.
From Superman's anguished reaction, the General

561
00:51:45,851 --> 00:51:51,154
doubts his connection to it, while a displeased
Waller secretly helps the prisoners escape,

562
00:51:51,474 --> 00:51:58,118
during which Livewire electrocutes Deathstroke's
right eye. A vengeful Ivo attacks Superman,

563
00:51:58,458 --> 00:52:04,526
but inadvertently frees him. Flip from the News
Kid Legion eventually finds Superman, and takes

564
00:52:04,566 --> 00:52:10,647
him to safety. Clark believes he was sent to
Earth to destroy it, but Lois assures him otherwise.

565
00:52:11,207 --> 00:52:16,689
Upon learning Ivo is siphoning the power grid
and going on a Kaiju rampage through the city,

566
00:52:17,149 --> 00:52:22,131
Lois and Jimmy use social media to petition
Metropolis's citizens to turn off their power,

567
00:52:22,511 --> 00:52:28,412
weakening Ivo so Superman can use his newly
awakened x-ray vision to locate and remove

568
00:52:28,552 --> 00:52:36,152
Ivo from the suit. As Superman and Lois declare
their love, Jimmy finds File X. On Checkmate's

569
00:52:36,172 --> 00:52:42,396
behalf, Waller demotes the General and gives
him Ivo's last invention, the Omega Cannon,

570
00:52:42,656 --> 00:52:50,101
with orders to kill Superman. And again, I didn't
love Ivo in this episode. The whole Kaiju parasite

571
00:52:50,121 --> 00:52:56,505
thing was recently done in Superman Man of Tomorrow.
So it wasn't like novel to see it done again.

572
00:52:56,970 --> 00:53:02,514
No, it was pretty cool how Superman's newly
gained ability of X-ray vision assisted in

573
00:53:02,694 --> 00:53:06,958
Parasite's defeat though. That was cool. Yeah,
I agree with that. I actually thought this

574
00:53:06,998 --> 00:53:11,742
was the season finale. I knew that there was
10 episodes, but for some reason I was like,

575
00:53:11,902 --> 00:53:16,786
oh, it must be a mistake. I think there's actually
only nine. So I was surprised and pleased to

576
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:22,090
see that there was episode 10, because I thought
episode 10 was great. Episode 10 was called

577
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:28,107
Hearts of the Fathers. After having nightmares
about Zero Day. Clark is promoted, along with

578
00:53:28,187 --> 00:53:33,791
Lois and Jimmy, to full reporters for their
article on Ivo's defeat. They have Thanksgiving

579
00:53:33,851 --> 00:53:39,795
dinner with Clark's parents, and Lois invites
her father, Sam Lane, revealed to be the General,

580
00:53:40,075 --> 00:53:46,260
though he fails to recognize Clark. In private,
Clark finds File X and the Kryptonite Shard,

581
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:52,044
which hurts him. His space pod reacts to the
Kryptonite, and releases a signal that prompts

582
00:53:52,084 --> 00:53:58,315
an invasion similar to Zero Day. Superman and
Sam battle the invaders, with Jimmy learning

583
00:53:58,355 --> 00:54:04,198
the kryptonite hurts them as well. Superman
takes the kryptonite and, despite being weakened,

584
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:10,080
uses it to destroy the mothership, halting the
invasion. A hologram of his father helps return

585
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:15,703
him to Earth. Sam prepares to kill him, but
Lois pleads for his life and reminds him that

586
00:54:15,743 --> 00:54:21,125
he just saved them, causing him to leave. Jimmy
reveals he sold his social media platform,

587
00:54:21,265 --> 00:54:27,882
Flamebird. to the daily planet for over 5 million
dollars and is now rich. On a distant world,

588
00:54:28,243 --> 00:54:35,389
a robot seemingly brainiac informs his Kryptonian
master about the halted invasion. His master,

589
00:54:35,809 --> 00:54:40,773
seemingly General Zod, says that the rebellious
world will soon kneel.

590
00:54:51,242 --> 00:54:56,686
All around well done. The action of this episode
was fantastic. When he started throwing down

591
00:54:57,107 --> 00:55:02,892
in that spaceship corridor with those robots,
right? I was like, kick their asses, Superman.

592
00:55:03,172 --> 00:55:09,217
Superman gets his own hallway fight scene. Yeah,
I mean, the action overall is not really comparable

593
00:55:09,257 --> 00:55:13,161
to some of the better anime action I've seen.
I think that could have actually been done

594
00:55:13,241 --> 00:55:18,565
better in the season, but I did really enjoy
seeing Superman throw down with all these robots.

595
00:55:19,094 --> 00:55:23,655
That's what the character is good for. You know,
these larger than life fights. Exactly. Yeah.

596
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:29,556
Superman has battles that no other superhero
really can have. It's top tier for sure. I

597
00:55:29,596 --> 00:55:34,278
also loved seeing Jor-El like help his son fight
alongside him in the hallway, just like short

598
00:55:34,318 --> 00:55:38,499
circuiting all those robots by zapping through
them as a hologram. I was like, you go, Jor-El,

599
00:55:38,739 --> 00:55:46,321
you go. I wasn't quite sure why Jor-El's recognition
of the Kryptonite initiated a Kryptonian invasion,

600
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:52,176
but I am super interested in seeing why all
of that happens the way it happens in season

601
00:55:52,216 --> 00:55:56,760
two, when we get reintroduced to characters
like Brainiac and General Zod, and get the

602
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:02,204
whole missing side of the story there. Exactly,
yeah, for sure. It almost seems like the ship

603
00:56:02,224 --> 00:56:06,808
woke up in a response to the kryptonite for
some reason, and there wasn't much that Jor-El

604
00:56:06,828 --> 00:56:11,952
could do about it. I'm not sure. I did love
the final line of Jimmy Olsen when he was like,

605
00:56:12,013 --> 00:56:16,576
oh yeah, I'm rich now. My mouth went open just
like everyone else's around the table, just

606
00:56:16,596 --> 00:56:22,171
like, what? What? It's definitely a fun angle
for Jimmy Olsen, I think. For sure. Really

607
00:56:22,191 --> 00:56:25,751
interested in seeing where that goes. Yeah,
I'm interested in seeing where all of it goes

608
00:56:25,791 --> 00:56:31,533
because this series is just so refreshing as
a DC fan and a Superman fan in particular.

609
00:56:32,053 --> 00:56:37,375
It modernizes the character in a way that, again,
I didn't think could ever be done. It was this

610
00:56:37,575 --> 00:56:44,217
perfect blend of anime action and romance and
the show's sleek character designs and charming

611
00:56:44,257 --> 00:56:50,315
animation just successfully modernized Superman
and his friends. so well that I'm giving this

612
00:56:50,355 --> 00:56:57,399
season 4.5 out of 5 stars, a fresh rating on
Rotten Tomatoes. Yeah, I have to agree with

613
00:56:57,419 --> 00:57:02,702
the 4.5 star rating. I wasn't going that way
at the beginning of the season, but one of

614
00:57:02,722 --> 00:57:07,684
the most impressive things about the show is
how it managed to turn me. My mind on what

615
00:57:07,704 --> 00:57:12,587
it was completely changed from beginning to
end. Like, at the start, I was like, this is

616
00:57:12,627 --> 00:57:18,046
like some kid's show, you know? I thought the
characterizations were too and the universe

617
00:57:18,066 --> 00:57:25,149
was too unrecognizable. But the characters really
grew throughout the season, and I think the

618
00:57:25,229 --> 00:57:31,312
universe that they built here came to be one
of the more compelling iterations of the Superman

619
00:57:31,332 --> 00:57:36,654
story ever. I agree. To me it was near perfect.
I think the worst thing you could say about

620
00:57:36,694 --> 00:57:41,636
it is that the show doesn't do the best job
of adapting lesser known Superman villains,

621
00:57:41,716 --> 00:57:46,743
but they are lesser known Superman villains.
You know, it's not like they botched Zod or

622
00:57:46,783 --> 00:57:51,947
Brainiac or Bizarro or something like that,
you know. These are Livewire and Heatwave.

623
00:57:52,407 --> 00:57:58,132
So I didn't mind the creative liberty they took
with the characters. And overall, fantastic

624
00:57:58,152 --> 00:58:02,875
show. Yeah, I hope the show does well because
I think that this version of Superman will

625
00:58:02,915 --> 00:58:09,100
be to the 2020s that Smallville's Clark Kent
was to the early 2000s. I hope so. I hope so

626
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:13,832
because Smallville was insanely popular. And
I hope for all the people who were maybe thinking

627
00:58:13,872 --> 00:58:17,435
about this show the same way we were going into
it, that it was, you know, just this kiddie

628
00:58:17,455 --> 00:58:23,000
show. Take the time to watch this and really
find something to admire like we did. But that

629

Dorothy Spinner and Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur.

641
00:59:26,457 --> 00:59:30,721
Yeah, this is going to be a pretty interesting
match. The story of Dorothy Spinner is pretty

642
00:59:30,781 --> 00:59:35,065
tragic. I don't know much about Moon Girl and
Devil Dinosaur, but I'm definitely interested

643
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:38,779
in seeing them throw down. But that does it
