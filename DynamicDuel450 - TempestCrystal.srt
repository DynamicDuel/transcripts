This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi, welcome to
the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,580
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:37,660
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Johnny DC and I'm his twin

4
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:44,260
brother Marvelous Joe. And in this episode we are
doing a duel between the characters of Tempest,

5
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:51,100
formerly known as Aqualad, and the Inhuman
Crystal. And this of course is in lead-up to our

6
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:57,760
Wildcats vs. Inhumans team duel that we will be
doing next week. Yeah, I've been dying to get to an

7
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,160
Inhumans team duel. I'm a big fan of the Inhumans,
not a big fan of the show that they put together on

8
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,600
ABC. But don't let that piece of shit, poor excuse,
attempt for a series detract you from learning

9
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,720
just how awesome the Inhumans are. The internet
never forgets. I neither will I. Before we get to

10
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,480
the duel, we're going to break down the comic book
movie news from the past week, of which there were

11
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:25,040
two news items, one being the Peacemaker Season 2
official red band trailer, and the new one being

12
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,320
the Marvel Zombies series release date. As
always, we list our segment times in our episode

13
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,140
description, so feel free to check out the show
notes if you want to skip ahead to a particular

14
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:40,100
topic. Guys, our artificially intelligent duel
simulator, AJ9K, has a quick message for our

15
00:01:40,100 --> 00:02:29,260
listeners, so listen up. Thanks AJ9K, and thanks
to everyone who supports the podcast, including

16
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:36,680
Josh Hayward, who had a birthday this past week.
Happy birthday, Josh. Also, Zachary Hepburn, two

17
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,360
of our patrons actually had birthdays this past
week, and I believe they both turned 35. Great age,

18
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,700
you guys could both be a president, or at least Josh
could, because Zach's Canadian. And because

19
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:54,580
you're Canadian, Zach, for your birthday, if I
could get you any gift from DC, it would be Captain

20
00:02:54,580 --> 00:03:00,480
Cold's cold gun, because it's cold up in Canada,
and that's all I really know about it. In the

21
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,840
winter, it's cold in Canada, right? You've been to
Vancouver, haven't you? Yes, and it was cold. And

22
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,840
for the Marvel guy, Josh Hayward, if I had to give
you a gift from Marvel, it would be the Falcons

23
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,680
wingsuit. Why? I don't know. Probably because I'm
looking at an image of the Falcon right now, and

24
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,620
that's the first thing that came to mind. Happy
birthday again to both of you guys, and thanks for

25
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,620
supporting the show. Be sure to tune into the other
shows on the Dynamite Podcast Network this week,

episode, the two determined who would win between

28
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:43,340
King K. Rool from Donkey Kong and King Hippo from
Punch Out. Great matchup. Over on the Max

00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:20,720
notes to listen to all the shows in the Dynamite
Podcast Network. Boat that out of the way. Quick to

36
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,740
the No Prize! A No Prize is an award that Marvel used
to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Dual

37
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:33,100
No Prize, is a digital award we post on Instagram
for the person that we feel gave the best answer to

38
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:39,000
our question of the week. Last week, or two weeks
ago actually, we asked you guys, what was the best

39
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,700
live action Spider-Man suit and the best live
action Batman suit and why? We got a few answers for

40
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,540
this one, not nearly as much as I thought we would
actually, but let's go ahead and run down the

41
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:56,720
honorable mentions and the No Prize winner. Our
first honorable mention goes to Alex Albro, who

42
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,320
said, Hey guys, I think Toby's black suit was the
best. I can remember the way the action figure felt

43
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,340
in my hand even 20 years later and seeing it come on
to him in the movie with a webby black virus looking

44
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:12,580
thing was a really cool visual. As for Batman, I
think George Clooney suits the best. You know,

45
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,160
it's the most anatomically correct, you could
say, and it just fits the tone of that film. I never

46
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:22,560
once questioned it as a kid and also it's got the
best Robin suit in that film. Thanks guys. Yeah,

47
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,120
the Toby McGuire Spider-Man suit is really good.
Definitely like the raised webbing look and the

48
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,480
symbiote suit that he wore from Spider-Man 3 was no
exception. They basically took like the sleek

49
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:39,600
shiny black webbing portion of a suit and applied
that to everywhere as opposed to just the webbing.

50
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,400
And I thought that was really cool because the
symbiote, you know, is supposed to be black and

51
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,960
shiny, at least venom is, you know. I still
remember the first look we got at the black

52
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,440
Spider-Man suit from Spider-Man 3. It was a really
cool poster of Spider-Man just like kneeling at

53
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,680
the edge of a building like a gargoyle in the rain.
And it was just all black and white. For some

54
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,640
reason, the photo was so striking. I thought it
looked really cool. And as for George Clooney

55
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:10,220
suits, what? Eww, bro. Nipples. You don't like
nipples? Everybody's got nipples. Come on. No,

56
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:17,860
no. I don't want nipples. You don't want nipples?
No. Great answer. Alex, our next honorable

57
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:25,780
mention goes to Daniel Alonso. Who said? Alright,
the best Spider-Man suit hands down is the Toby

58
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:32,920
McGuire one. I mean, the raised webbing, the best
spider on the front and the back. The eyes are

59
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:39,100
amazing. And then it all has this underlying
checkered pattern throughout the fabric. Its

60
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:45,880
colors are fantastic. It's just the best suit. And
best Batman suit? Probably Batterson. I think

61
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,280
it's the most menacing, the most realistic. He
just looks like a tank. I love that one. Yeah,

62
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,460
another shout out for Toby McGuire's Spider-Man
suit. I really think that that was the suit that

63
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,500
brought superhero costumes into the modern age. I
mean, before that we had the X-Men, but they didn't

64
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,620
really quite nail the suit in a way that I think was
satisfying for fans. Nobody was complaining

65
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:09,340
about Toby McGuire suit when that movie first came
out because it was literal perfection.

66
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:14,600
Everything from the material to the design, the
eye design, as Daniel mentioned, it was flawless.

67
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:21,180
Do you think that the Toby McGuire Spider logo was
better than Andrew Garfield's though? Or maybe

68
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,620
Tom Holland's? It's a great question. Honestly,
my favorite Spider emblem is probably Andrew

69
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:32,260
Garfield's, I think. That's what I was thinking.
Yeah, yeah. I would agree with that. As for

70
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,900
Banson's suit, it's definitely the least comic
book accurate, but you're right. With the steel

71
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:42,720
plating, he almost looks like a knight in his
armor, just wearing a cowl and a cape. He looks

72
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,880
badass. I really, really want him to be part of the
DCU. I'm not going to stop saying it until it's like

73
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,900
official official. You're going to try to
manifest it? Absolutely. Like until James Gunn

74
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,680
announces the casting for his Batman, I'm still
going to insist that it should be Robert

75
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,980
Pattinson. If that does happen, though, I would
probably insist as a fan that he get a more comic

76
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:09,240
accurate bat suit. No, no, I'm fine with it. Great
answer, Daniel. Our final honorable mention goes

77
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:16,340
to Scott Camacho. Who said? Scott Camacho here. If
I had to pick a Spider-Man suit, it would be Toby

78
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:24,860
McGuire. He was our first introduction into live
action Spider-Man and his suit was pretty much on

79
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:32,220
point. And I'm a big fan of the black suit. And for
Batman, it's Ben Affleck's Batman. It's

80
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:37,840
everything we wanted from the Dark Knight Returns
put into silver screen. It was awesome. Yeah,

81
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,880
we've already spoken at length about Toby
McGuire's suit, but let's talk about Ben

82
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,780
Affleck's bat suit. I would also say that this is my
favorite bat suit on screen. I'm not counting like

83
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:52,180
the armored version from the Dark Knight Returns
when he fought against Superman. Even though that

84
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:57,600
was fantastic. I'm talking more about his
standard Batman suit from Batman v Superman, Dawn

85
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,500
of Justice. Extended Edition. Yeah, that one is
the most comic book accurate. That one was

86
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:08,060
straight from the page. I loved how buff he was. It
was very Frank Miller. It was awesome. I didn't

87
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:13,420
really like Ben Affleck's bat suit in Justice
League. Oh, no. Yeah, his best one was definitely

88
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:20,280
in BVS. I would agree. And then his bat suit that was
in the Flash movie fucking sucked. We don't talk

89
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:26,240
about that. Shut up. All right. Great answer,
Scotty. But the winner of this week's No Prize is

90
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,440
Lorenzo Valdez. Who said? This is Lorenzo Valdez.
You guys actually referenced my favorite

91
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:38,100
Spider-Man suit, which is the Amazing Spider-Man
2 suit. It doesn't hurt that that was the suit that

92
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:45,880
Spidey was wearing when Gwen died. So it has that
extra emotional impact for me seeing that suit. As

93
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:52,060
for my favorite Batman suit, that would be the Dark
Knight slash the Dark Knight Rises suit because it

94
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,480
improves on the texture of the begin suit and it
also has a better bat symbol. Clonifer, always

95
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:04,100
bye-bye. Yeah, this is the first guy to not mention
the Toby McGuire suit as his favorite. And I may

96
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,440
agree. I definitely think that the Spider-Man
suit that was in the Amazing Spider-Man 2 worn by

97
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:15,780
Andrew Garfield was the most comic book accurate.
I mean, because I've never seen a version of Spidey

98
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:20,340
in the comics where like this raised webbing look,
it doesn't look quite as homemade as it were, even

99
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,900
though it looked spectacular or amazing as it
were. But Andrew Garfield's looked like

100
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:30,380
something that somebody could conceivably
create that wasn't, you know, a fashion designer,

101
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:36,160
but it also looks very true to the comic books. It
had the larger eyes. It had great color, had a great

102
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,560
like spider emblem design. It was just
perfection, in my opinion. Yeah, the only thing it

103
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,780
really didn't have was Tom Holland's lenses, like
the thick Steve Ditko lenses. But yeah, still

104
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:51,320
really cool. Now, we will admit that the Christian
Bale Batman outfits are actually my least

105
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:58,140
favorite onscreen Batman suits. But of all of
them, my favorite is actually from Batman Begins.

106
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,500
I loved his cowl the way it made him look almost
panther-like. When he upgraded to his new suit

107
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:08,260
where he was able to turn his neck. Yeah, I get why
that would be good for a crime fighter. But I also

108
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:14,400
thought it kind of gave him a bobble head. I think
that Robert Pansen's outfit is actually a pretty

109
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:21,100
solid upgrade to the Dark Knight suits. You like
the Joel Schumacher Batsuits more than Christian

110
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:27,600
Bales? No, I guess I misspoke. Yeah, those ones are
way worse. So I should say that, well, I slightly

111
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,800
disagree with you, Lorenzo. They're not terrible
suits. They're just not my personal favorites. I

112
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,780
like the functionality of the Christian Bale
Batsuits, especially as it was explained in

113
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:43,140
universe in those films with like the special
hardening cloth when you would run an electric

114
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:48,740
current through it. Things like that make it
better than Robert Pansen's suit, who just uses a

115
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:55,140
weird ass basic squirrel suit, you know. Bale had
better shit in general. Yeah, well, Bale had

116
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:01,020
Lucius Fox as his cue, so he had better tech
overall. What about the bat emblem, as Lorenzo

117
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:07,720
Bale does mentioned? You know, I never really
cared for like the straight, flat top emblem. I

118
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,920
like a little bit of curves in my Batman logo, you
know. Well, great answer, Lorenzo. You win this

119
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,940
week's No Prize. If you're the listener, want to
shot at winning your own No Prize, stay tuned to

120
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:21,820
later on in the episode when we'll be asking
another question of the week. And now that that's

121
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:33,080
done, on to the news. OK, with the premiere of
Peacemaker Season 2 coming up soon, HBO Max has

122
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:39,160
released an official red band trailer for the
series, which I thought would delve more into the

123
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:44,420
story, but it was really just a showcase for how
raunchy and violent the series is going to be.

124
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:51,240
Like, I forgot how raunchy James Gunn can get until
this whole trailer starts off with a friggin orgy

125
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:56,200
in Peacemaker's house. And vigilante
complaining about how he wasn't invited. I'm fine

126
00:12:56,200 --> 00:13:00,920
with the no story stuff, though. I don't want to
know too much about the story as we go into it, but

127
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:07,040
this trailer did remind me basically just how much
of a good time I'm in for watching it. Because the

128
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:13,160
first season was hilarious and I was laughing my
ass off during this red band trailer. Yeah, after

129
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,260
we learned that Rick Flagg Sr. is looking for
Peacemaker because he has a dimensional portal

130
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:24,020
similar to Lex Luthor, we just get a series of
jokes, including this creepy looking alien that

131
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:29,920
steps through one of Peacemaker's portals and
just refuses to say hi. And Peacemaker's like,

132
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:36,780
fuck you then, you cryptkeeper looking bitch. So
good. It is interesting that they are addressing

133
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,840
the fact that Lex Luthor had his own dimensional
portal and that Peacemaker's dad, the White

134
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,540
Dragon, also has one. It's strange because it
seems like White Dragon's portal is better and

135
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:54,520
more stable than Lex Luthor's. Seemingly, yeah.
So does that make White Dragon smarter than Lex

136
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:01,280
Luthor? I don't think so. I know we'll be getting
new versions of White Dragon and maybe in some

137
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,780
other universe there was a version that was
smarter than Lex Luthor. And he just happened to

138
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:12,260
create portals for all of the other White Dragons
and all of the other multiverses. That's just my

139
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:16,440
guess though. But I would agree that it definitely
looks more stable. It looks like there's going to

140
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:21,820
be a lot of action in this season, lots of
explosions, bloody explosions it looks like,

141
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,780
including an explosion where tomatoes get
flicked in the face with a nail or something like

142
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:31,920
that. And eagerly rips a dude's eyeball out. Yeah,
that was wild. Or a finger or both. Yeah, it looks

143
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,920
like he just shreds the guy. Of course, at the end of
the trailer, we get a callback to the dick alien.

144
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:42,040
Not too much more to the trailer other than that. If
you guys haven't watched Peacemaker Season 1,

145
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:47,440
watch it now so you can get caught up in time for the
show's release. It debuts this Thursday, August

146
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:55,080
21st on HBO Max. I can't wait for the show. I love the
writing. I love the cast. But speaking of the cast,

147
00:14:55,080 --> 00:15:04,940
that brings us to our question of the week. What is
your favorite supporting cast in a Marvel or DC

148
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:12,120
ensemble series and why? Yeah, every television
series based on a superhero usually has a cast of

149
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:17,720
characters that support the main hero titular
character. We just want to know which cast of

150
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,940
characters is your favorite. Record your answer
at dynamicduld.com by clicking on the red

153
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:35,260
include you on the podcast. We'll pick our
favorite answer and award that person a dynamic

154
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:42,900
duel no prize that we'll post to Instagram. Be sure
to answer before August 23rd. And in Marvel News,

155
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:48,060
we learned this past week that Disney Plus has
moved up the Marvel Zombies release date so that

156
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:55,500
instead of debuting on October 3rd, it's going to
now debut a week earlier on September 24th. The

157
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,860
season is going to be four episodes that are going
to be released weekly. So all the episodes will be

158
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:05,900
out before Halloween, but still close enough,
which is appropriate for a horror animated

159
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:11,780
series. I forgot that this show was even coming out
this year. How could you forget? This is going to be

160
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:17,360
amazing. The What If episode that included the
Marvel Zombies, which was called What If Zombies,

161
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:23,940
that was back in 2021, I believe. That was one of the
best episodes of that season. And Marvel Zombies

162
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:29,220
is a really enjoyable story. It really grew some
written by Robert Kirkman back in the day, but this

163
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,620
is going to be a new version of it. I made for screen
adaptation that started with that What If

164
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,560
episode. Really excited to see where it goes. If
you guys want to learn more about the Marvel

165
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,320
Zombies universe, definitely check out our
Deceased vs. Marvel Zombies Team Duel episode.

166
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:49,300
Yeah, that was a lot of fun. I heard that in this
upcoming Marvel Zombies season, we're going to

167
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:54,360
get other characters that weren't in the previous
episode, including Moon Knight and Blade and

168
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:59,080
Shang-Chi's also going to be there. So yeah, it's
going to be a big blast. Wait, is Blade going to be

169
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:05,720
voiced by Mahershala Ali? That I do not know. That
would be interesting. That would be fantastic.

170
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,500
Really looking forward to it in just over a month.
And I hope you guys are too. We're not going to be

171
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,119
reviewing it for this show. I guess depending on
how people react to it, we'll determine whether or

172
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,319
not I take the time to watch. You're going to be
watching. It's only four episodes. It's going to

173
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,740
be a quick, easy watch, perfect for the season. I'm
definitely going to be watching. You're

174
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,700
definitely going to be watching, motherfucker.
And if you don't, I'm going to make you. I don't know

175
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:36,340
how yet, but I will find a way. Yeah, bro. You don't
scare me. Why not? Your face? I don't know. It's too

176
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:49,200
much like mine. Both all the news out of the way. Now
let's get on to the main event where we find out who

177
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:56,020
would win in a matchup between Aquaman's former
sidekick Tempest and the inhuman princess

178
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:18,120
Crystal. Okay, Tempest versus Crystal. Now both
of these characters are elemental manipulators,

179
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:23,160
I guess you could say. Yeah. Crystal controls all
four of the elements, whereas Tempest controls

180
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:29,020
more temperature of water, but he could generate
water through Atlantean sorcery. And like

181
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:34,340
Crystal, he's also royalty. He's a prince of
Atlantis. Crystal can generate water too,

182
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:39,100
through chemistry. Okay, but can't she control
the temperature of that water? Yes, she can by

183
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:45,200
controlling its molecular movement. Too shane.
But we know that Tempest has some magical

184
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,960
abilities in addition to his hydrokinesis, and
Crystal also has some inhuman physiology traits

185
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,020
going for her. So we figure the characters kind of
balance each other out. It'll be interesting

186
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:00,160
really to see how this matchup goes, considering
they have very similar powers, especially when it

187
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:05,820
comes to water. Basically, who will control the
water the best is what we're asking Kare. Oh, easy.

188
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:13,060
Tempest. Oh, you think so, huh? Okay. Yeah, I do. In
fact, you mentioned earlier. That Crystal was in

189
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:19,140
the Inhumans TV series that was gosh awful.
Actually, Tempest has been in a TV series as well.

190
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:24,200
If you remember, he was in the Titan show. Was he? I
don't remember that. Yeah, he was blond in that

191
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,780
though. Trying to remember him. He died in the
second season in like a flashback. I see. Okay.

192
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:35,200
Well, in the Inhuman show, Crystal was played by
Isabel Cornish, and I remember she never really

193
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,100
got to show off her powers too much, largely due to
the insufficient budget for the show itself, I

194
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,740
think. One of these days, we'll get a good Inhuman
show or movie. We're moving on to the duel to

195
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:50,260
explain the methodology behind our duels. Let's
go to our sentient duel simulator, Alfred Jarvis

196
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:58,100
9000. AJ9K, tell our listeners how you go about
determining a winner in our duel matchups. Yes, of

197
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:03,100
course, sir. The way I determine a winner between
the contestants is by running 1000 Monte Carlo

198
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:08,480
simulations using the characters statistics. A
Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic model

199
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,200
used to determine outcomes through random
sampling. In this case, I randomize the

200
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,140
statistics along a normal distribution as a way to
simulate the many variables that can occur during

201
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:23,100
battle. The stat parameters are based on the
official Marvel power grid from which the DC

202
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,740
characters statistics are extrapolated.
Additional stat categories are included such as

203
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:33,280
range, damage potential, versatility and
perception in order to create a more detailed and

204
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,640
accurate simulation. The results of the 1000
simulations provide a percentage of wins for each

205
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,200
character. The contestant with the higher
percentage is declared the victor as they have a

206
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,500
higher probability to win any given battle. In an
equitable pairing, neither character should win

207
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:53,840
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat

208
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,300
Superman, so the confidence rate of my method
falls in line with the precedents that have been

209
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,140
established in the source material. My
mathematical simulations are without

210
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:07,720
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for

211
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,160
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K.
Before we run the simulations though, we like to

212
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:17,740
break down each character's histories and
abilities before improvising a scenario on how we

213
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:23,420
imagine one of the 1000 simulations would play out
beat for beat. And I believe it's my turn to go first

214
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:29,080
with the Marvel characters backstory, so let me
tell you all about Crystal. Crystallia

215
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:36,120
Immaculinn was born in the hidden city of Adolan to
Cwelyn in Amber, members of the Inhumans race, a

216
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,600
people whose ancestors were genetically altered
by the alien Kree. As the younger sister of

217
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:48,040
Medusa-Lith Immaculinn, later Queen Medusa,
Crystal belonged to the Inhuman Royal Family.

218
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:53,600
Like many Inhuman children, she was exposed as an
infant to the Tarogen Mist, a substance for people

219
00:21:53,600 --> 00:22:00,860
used to unlock powers. And she gained control over
the four elements of Earth, Air, Fire, and Water.

220
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,740
You can learn more about the Inhumans and
Tarogenesis in our Shazam vs Black Bolt dual

221
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:11,320
episode. When Crystal was young, her cousin
Maximus seized power and forced the Royal Family

222
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,760
out of the Great Refuge. During exile, they
searched across Asia, Europe, and America for her

223
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:22,640
missing sister Medusa, living in hiding along the
way. They found her in New York City, where she had

224
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,520
joined the villainous Frightful Four while
suffering from memory loss. You can learn more

225
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,420
about Medusa in her duel against elongated man. In
New York, Crystal met Johnny Storm, the human

226
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:39,400
torch of the Fantastic Four, and the two began a
romance. Maximus later trapped Adolan inside an

227
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,620
impenetrable barrier, separating Crystal from
Johnny. When the barrier finally fell, the Royal

228
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:49,440
Family explored the outside world. Crystal
helped the Fantastic Four rescue Mr. Fantastic

229
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,960
from the negative zone dimension and fought
beside them against the invader Blastar. She left

230
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:00,060
Adolan for an extended stay in New York and became
part of the Fantastic Four's daily life, running

231
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:05,600
communications and supporting the pregnant Sue
Richards. When Sue went on maternity leave,

232
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,340
Crystal earned a place on missions as her stand-in
proved herself by defeating their villain, the

233
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:16,740
Wizard, on her own, then battling foes such as Dr.
Doom, the Mole Man, and the Alien Scrolls. You can

234
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,920
learn more about the Fantastic Four in their duel
against the Justice Society. Over time, Earth's

235
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,400
pollution, which is toxic to many inhumans, began
to harm Crystal's health, and she set out to return

236
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,320
to Adolan. On her journey back, the alchemist
Diablo captured her and tricked her into

237
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,140
believing she was the Mayan goddess Ishal. After
the Fantastic Four freed her, Crystal

238
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,600
encountered the mutant Quicksilver, wounded
from battle, and she nursed him back to health.

239
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,500
Choosing him over Johnny, she married
Quicksilver in the first recorded union between

240
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:52,060
an inhuman and a human mutate. You can learn more
about Quicksilver in his duel against the Flash.

241
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:57,280
When Adolan was later moved to the Moon, the couple
lived there and welcomed a daughter, Luna, who

242
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:02,760
showed no special abilities. Quicksilver wanted
to expose Luna to the Tarjan Mist to grant her

243
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:08,140
powers, but Crystal refused. Life in Adolan
strained their marriage. Quicksilver's temper

244
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:13,240
and his effort to prove himself as a commander in
the Inhuman Militia kept him away from home.

245
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,860
Lonely, Crystal began an affair with a human real
estate agent, subtly mentally influenced by

246
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:23,840
Maximus, who sought to increase the marriage's
tensions. When Quicksilver discovered the

247
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,380
affair, he fled Adolan and the marriage
fractured. Crystal rejoined the Fantastic Four,

248
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:33,940
though her lingering feelings for Johnny made
life in New York tense, especially since Johnny

249
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:39,520
was then married to a woman later revealed to be the
Skrull Imposter, Lygia. Duty soon called Crystal

250
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,840
back to Adolan to help with a crisis involving
Medusa and Black Bolt's child, and there she and

251
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,220
Quicksilver tried again to make peace. Their
troubles soon expanded beyond Adolan when Luna

252
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:55,480
was kidnapped by Magneto's acolytes. Crystal
called on the Avengers to rescue her and soon

253
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,840
joined the team herself. She moved with Luna into
the Avengers mansion. With the team, she fought

254
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,940
the alien brethren, villainous alternate
universe Avengers, and the Kree Star Force during

255
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,680
a war between the Kree and the Shiar empires.
During this period, Crystal developed feelings

256
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:15,920
for her teammate, Dane Whitman, the Black Knight,
especially after he saved Luna from the Star

257
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:21,540
Jammer's and later saved Quicksilver's life.
Crystal and Dane shared a single late night kiss,

258
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:27,120
but she would not pursue it while still married.
Fellow Avengers Cersei of the Eternals also saw a

259
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,100
relationship with Dane, and Cersei and Dane later
vanished to another dimension altogether,

260
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:36,960
ending the possibility of a love triangle. You can
learn more about Cersei in her duel against

261
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,900
Firestorm. While battling the Bloodcursed
Warrior called the Bloodraith, Crystal was

262
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:47,500
transported into caverns beneath Adolan where
many Alpha Primitives, who were mindless slaves,

263
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:51,600
dwelt. Recovering the Black Knight's Ebony
Blade, she was briefly hailed by the Alpha

264
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,880
Primitives as ruler before returning to the
Avengers. Soon after, many heroes, including

265
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,060
Crystal, sacrificed themselves to stop
Onslaught, a world-threatening psychic entity

266
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,500
you can learn more about in his duel against
Parallax. Crystal and the others were not truly

267
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:12,220
killed, but reborn in a pocket universe with no
memories. There, Crystal again drew close to

268
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:17,280
Johnny Storm until they all returned to their
original reality. Back on Earth, she reunited

269
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:23,140
with Quicksilver, and a brief attempt by Maximus
to control Pietro's mind was exposed and stopped,

270
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:28,120
though he and the Black Knight still quarreled
over Crystal's affections. A later reality shift

271
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,140
by the Scarlet Witch depowered most of Earth's
mutants, including Quicksilver. Desperate he

272
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:37,780
stole the Tarogen crystals from Adolan,
kidnapped his daughter Luna, and exposed her to

273
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:43,620
the Mists, which granted her empathic abilities.
The Inhuman Genetics Council annulled Crystal's

274
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:48,400
marriage at that point, changed Luna's last name
from Maximoff to Immaculin, and returned the

275
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,760
child back to Crystal. When human authority
seized the crystals and refused to return them,

276
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,420
the Inhumans declared war on the United States.
During this conflict, Quicksilver submitted

277
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:02,760
himself to Black Bolt's judgment for his
betrayal, and Crystal took part in clashes with

278
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:08,180
Shield and the mighty Avengers. The royal family
soon took Adaline into space and turned against

279
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:13,420
the alien Skrulls, who had abducted Black Bolt.
Seeking support, the Inhuman Royal Family

280
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:19,120
approached the Kree Empire. Ronin the Accuser,
the Kree ruler at the time, welcomed an alliance

281
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,420
with the Inhumans if Crystal would marry him.
Although the match began as a political bargain,

282
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:29,240
Crystal came to respect Ronin and the stability
their union could bring. The wedding was

283
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,130
interrupted when the Shiar Imperial Guard
attacked, with the Inhumans being killed. During

284
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:37,470
Vulcan's invasion of Kree space, Ronan was beaten
nearly to death in the assaults, and while Crystal

285
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:42,310
visited him in recovery, she helped rally the Kree
by showing public compassion to injured

286
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:47,490
commoners. The scenes broadcast across the
empire earned her the nickname, The People's

287
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:52,330
Princess. Black Bolt later sought to spread
pterogen across the galaxy using a bomb,

288
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:57,830
believing it would make all beings equal. Crystal
judged the plan dangerous, and with the inhuman

289
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:03,050
teleporting dog, Lockjaw, she reached the bomb
and neutralized the pterogen qualities inside

290
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:08,010
the device. A final battle between Black Bolt and
Vulcan caused the bomb, now just a normal

291
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:13,690
explosive to detonate, and both rulers were
believed dead, making Crystal's sister Medusa

292
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:18,890
queen. In time, Black Bolt returned, and the
inhumans and the Kree supreme intelligence

293
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:27,450
agreed to a truce that separated Crystal and
Ronan's marriage for the arranged marriage had

294
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:32,810
grown into a genuine bond. Back on Earth, Medusa
appointed Crystal as an ambassador. She

295
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:37,770
commanded the royal inhuman vessel with a team
that included her cousin Gorgon, the stealthy

296
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:44,190
Naja, the geokinetic Flint, and the technopathic
Grid. Crystal worked to protect nations touched

297
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:49,690
by the drifting pterogen cloud that was released
by Black Bolt, which could awaken powers in latent

298
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:54,750
inhumans. The cloud however was harmful to
mutants, and she secretly coordinated with them

299
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:59,310
to help those who were threatened by the cloud.
Crystal's crew then carried out relief missions

300
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:03,950
around the world. In Sydney, Australia, she
confronted protesters who had captured a newly

301
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:09,250
formed inhuman. She used measured force to
disperse the mob, freed the captive, and added new

302
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:14,410
recruits to her ship. Crystal remained involved
in wider disputes among Earth's heroes, like when

303
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:19,890
the inhuman named Ulysses gained the ability to
foresee potential futures. Crystal and Medusa

304
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:23,990
introduced him to leading heroes to debate
whether his visions should guide crime-biting

305
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:29,710
actions, and a clash followed with Iron Man over
Ulysses' custody as tensions later rose between

306
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:35,190
heroes debating the ethics of preemptive
justice. And that's Crystal's backstory.

307
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:39,670
Powers-wise, Crystal has the enhanced
physiology of an inhuman granted to her through

308
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:45,350
pterogenesis. This includes greater strength,
speed, and durability than any normal human. She

309
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:50,530
also has the psionic ability to manipulate the
four elements of air, water, fire, and earth.

310
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:55,910
Crystal's like the Avatar, the last airbender,
and that she can control the size, shape,

311
00:29:55,910 --> 00:30:01,510
intensity, and molecular motion of these
elements. She can use her power over air to fly,

312
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:06,810
create tornado-level gusts, and create force
barriers. She can also control and generate

313
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:12,130
lightning by manipulating the electrical charge
of the air. Crystal can combine oxygen and

314
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:16,810
hydrogen gases in the air to create water, which
she can also control, even dropping its

315
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:21,730
temperature to form ice and freeze things. She can
also compress the oxygen in the air to ignite

316
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:27,010
existing hydrogen, or dust, and create a
spontaneous combustion of fire, which she can

317
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:31,950
also control. Lastly, she can control the ground
and rock beneath her for various effects,

318
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:36,990
including creating seismic tremors. Crystal can
combine elemental effects to also control things

319
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:44,070
like dust storms, typhoons, steam clouds,
firestorms, and lava. She also has limited hand

320
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:49,730
combat training. And that's Crystal. So were her
powers initially just like the four Hellenistic

321
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:55,970
elements that later evolved to basically the
whole periodic table? No, she can't control the

322
00:30:55,970 --> 00:31:01,550
periodic table. She can control the gases in the
air, some of which are oxygen and hydrogen, which

323
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:06,250
she can then manipulate further to create
elements that she can also control. But she can't

324
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:10,510
control something like xenon or something like
that, you know, that's not naturally found in the

325
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:15,550
air. The electricity thing is a little weird,
because even since her inception, she was able to

326
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:20,590
like throw lightning bolts, which didn't make
sense considering electricity is a part of the

327
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:26,270
four classic elements. And they kind of kept it in
more modern iterations, rationalizing it as her

328
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:32,110
ability to control the electrical charge of the
molecules she's manipulating. I get it. I mean, if

329
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:38,490
you think about it in avatar terms, lightning is
just kind of like another version of fire. Not

330
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:45,170
really, but sure. I mean, once you said she's like
the avatar, I was like, okay, I got it. A good

331
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:50,730
matchup would actually be between Ang, Inc.,
however you pronounce it, and Crystal, Inc.,

332
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:55,310
yeah, whatever. I never watched the show. Okay,
we're going to stop recording right now, so you can

333
00:31:55,310 --> 00:32:00,990
watch the whole show because you need to do that.
I'll watch it eventually, maybe after the podcast

334
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:05,550
ends in January. Yeah, that should be the first
thing you do with your newfound free time. But it's

335
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:09,790
been a while, I feel like since we've found some
interesting connections between the characters

336
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:13,890
that we paint in duels against each other, there
are definitely some similarities between

337
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:18,990
Tempest and Crystal beyond just their power set
and the fact that they're royalty. But let me go

338
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:26,430
into that in Tempest's origin. Garth was born to
Queen Bera and King Thar of the Idolists, a

339
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:33,090
mystical offshoot of Atlanteans who dwelled in
the Hidden Valley for over 4,000 years. His birth

340
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:40,030
marked by the rare sign of violet eyes considered a
symbol of great magical potential came during a

341
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:46,230
time of political turmoil. Fearing that Garth's
birthright ritual could inadvertently free King

342
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:52,910
Thar's banished brother, the Necromancer
Slyzath, Idolist radicals executed King Thar,

343
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:59,510
exiled Queen Bera, and condemned Garth to death.
Labeled genetically inferior by Atlanteans

344
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:06,230
unaware of his true heritage, Garth was abandoned
on a remote seabed to die. Surviving against all

345
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:11,330
odds, Garth was secretly nurtured by the
Atlantean sorcerer Atlan who taught him basic

346
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:17,950
survival and language skills. Eventually he was
discovered by Aquaman who took him in as a ward.

347
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:22,770
Adopting the name Aqualad, Garth became
Aquaman's sidekick and served Atlantis

348
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:28,330
faithfully. When Aquaman ascended to the throne,
Garth was acknowledged as a prince by adoption,

349
00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:33,350
though his presence remained controversial due
to lingering superstitions. Seeking

350
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:39,130
companionship and purpose beyond Aquaman's
shadow, Garth became a founding member of the Teen

351
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:45,510
Titans, working alongside other young heroes
such as Robin, Kid Flash, and Wonder Girl. You can

352
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:51,890
learn more about the Teen Titans in our Titans vs
X-Men Teen Duel episode. Over time, he began to

353
00:33:51,890 --> 00:33:57,950
grow apart from his mentor, especially following
the birth of Aquaman's son. The death of Garth's

354
00:33:57,950 --> 00:34:04,150
longtime partner Tula, known as Aqua during the
Crisis on Infinite Earths, devastated him,

355
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:09,190
pushing him to sever ties with Atlantis and rejoin
the Titans, where he continued to forge his own

356
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:15,409
path as a hero. After years of service as Aqualad,
Garth's life changed forever when he encountered

357
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:21,730
a tribe of shark-like merpeople and was drawn into
another dimension by Atlan. There, Atlan

358
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:28,190
revealed Garth's royal lineage and trained him in
the arcane disciplines of his idolist ancestors.

359
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:33,550
Garth learned to control the temperatures of
water, unleash mystical energy blasts from his

360
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:39,570
eyes, and tap into elemental forces beyond
traditional Atlantean science. To unlock his

361
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:45,710
full magical potential, Garth was required to
complete a ritual in the Hidden Valley, a rite

362
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:51,630
leaked to the prison of Slyzath. Returning to the
capital, the idolists, he found it overrun by

363
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:56,830
undead creatures and was confronted by a
resurrected Tula, whose form had been twisted

364
00:34:56,830 --> 00:35:03,550
into a trap by Slyzath. Betrayed mid-ritual,
Garth overcame the deception, destroyed the

365
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:09,710
false aquagirl, and re-emprisoned his uncle.
Emerging victorious, Garth shed the Aqualad

366
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:16,150
identity and claimed a new title, Tempest. As
Tempest, Garth assumed greater leadership in

367
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:21,730
Atlantean affairs. He served as Atlantis'
ambassador to the United Nations and stood at

368
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:26,450
Aquaman's side during global and
interdimensional conflicts. Their bond was once

369
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:32,570
again tested when Dolphin, Aquaman's former
partner, fell in love with Garth. She and Garth

370
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:38,370
eventually married and had a son, Sirdian.
Seeking stability, Garth stepped back from

371
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:43,770
frontline heroics to focus on diplomacy and
family, although he briefly rejoined the Titans

372
00:35:43,770 --> 00:35:49,310
to assist in critical missions. During a cosmic
upheaval, Garth attempted to use Atlantean magic

373
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:55,390
to undo a spell that had altered the Atlantean
Queen Mera's biology. The spell attracted the

374
00:35:55,390 --> 00:36:01,190
wrath of the Spectre, who attacked Atlantis. The
city was nearly annihilated and Garth was

375
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:07,110
presumed dead. You can learn more about Mera in her
duel against Invisible Woman. Garth was later

376
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:13,970
found alive but a Misiak in Sub Diego, the sunken
San Diego, having lost his powers and abilities to

377
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:19,830
breathe underwater. Those magical and physical
abilities eventually returned, his wife and son

378
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:26,210
were lost in the destruction of Atlantis, both
presumed dead. Haunted by grief and guilt, Garth

379
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:31,110
crowned himself King of Atlantis in the absence of
Aquaman, believing it was time for new

380
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:36,070
leadership. Though his reign was short-lived,
while attempting to relocate Arthur Curry's

381
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:42,730
remains with Mera, he was ambushed by reanimated
Black Lanterns, Dolphin, Tula, and Aquaman

382
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:49,350
himself. Garth was killed and reanimated as a
Black Lantern, though ultimately destroyed when

383
00:36:49,350 --> 00:36:55,470
the emotional spectrum was restored. Following
the Flashpoint reset of DC's continuity, Garth's

384
00:36:55,470 --> 00:37:01,610
timeline was restructured. Once again, he was
depicted as an exiled Atlantean child, cast out

385
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:07,610
for his violet eyes. Rescued and raised by
Aquaman, he became Aqualad and helped form the

386
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:13,090
Teen Titans alongside Robin, Dona Troy, and
others. Though he once forgot these events due to

387
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:18,350
mystical interference, the return of Wally West
helped restore his memories and reawaken his

388
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:23,270
bonds with his teammates. You can learn more about
Wally West in our Flash vs. Speedball duel

389
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:29,810
episode. During this time, Garth enrolled in the
Silent School, Atlantis' elite College of

390
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:35,210
Sorcery. There, he studied advanced magical
disciplines and fell in love with a fellow student

391
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:41,890
named Sira. When a magical experiment caused her
death, Garth blamed the school's leadership,

392
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:47,330
particularly the headmaster, Locke, for
encouraging unsafe magical practices.

393
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:54,110
Disillusioned, he swore off magic and joined the
Drift, a Black Ops Atlantean unit specializing in

394
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:59,650
covert aquatic missions. When Aquaman was
declared a traitor and hunted by Atlantean

395
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:06,070
forces, Garth was enlisted to capture his former
mentor. Though loyal to Atlantis, Garth retained

396
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:11,170
his sense of honor and justice, ultimately siding
with Aquaman when he became clear that the true

397
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:17,930
threat came from another dimension. He fought
alongside Mara, a new Tula, and Aquaman to repel

398
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:23,290
the invading realm of Thule and helped stabilize
Atlantis in the aftermath. His connection to the

399
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:28,790
Titans was rekindled during an alien invasion.
Joining the new roster alongside Donutroy, Beast

400
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:33,190
Boy, Raven, and Miss Martian, each of whom you can
learn more about in their respective Duel

401
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:38,610
episodes, Garth helped lead a strike against
alien warships, poisoning Earth's oceans and

402
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:44,850
mutating its people. In the climactic battle, he
sacrificed himself to hold off the alien god,

403
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:50,630
Drogue, allowing the others to escape. Though
presumed lost, Garth later returned, having

404
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:56,670
survived the encounter. He eventually supported
the formation of Titans Academy, mentoring young

405
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:02,090
heroes and protecting them during times of
crisis. When Red Axe attacked the Titans Tower in

406
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:07,230
San Francisco and magical forces threatened
Earth, Tempest defended the students and battled

407
00:39:07,230 --> 00:39:12,530
alongside his former teammates. Recently, he
stood with Earth's remaining defenders against

408
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:18,590
Deathstroke's corrupted army, reaffirming his
role as a steadfast protector of both Atlantis and

409
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:24,090
the surface world. The powers-wise, as an
Atlantean, Tempest possesses a range of

410
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:30,130
superhuman traits, including enhanced
strength, durability, and speed, optimized for

411
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:34,910
survival at extreme ocean depths. He can breathe
underwater indefinitely through microscopic

412
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:40,750
pores in the skin and sees clearly in darkness and
murky environments. His hearing and sense of

413
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:45,770
smell are also heightened to adapt to aquatic
conditions. While capable of functioning on

414
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:51,870
land, he does require periodic exposure to water
to maintain peak condition. Garth's magical

415
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:57,750
abilities surpass those of most Atlanteans,
stemming from his royal idolist lineage. Trained

416
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:03,490
by the sorcerer Atlan and educated at the Silent
School, he can project destructive eldritch

417
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:10,150
energy from his hands or eyes, summon and
manipulate water and rapidly heat or freeze large

418
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:16,750
volumes of liquid. He can construct mystical
barriers, perform astral projection, and open

419
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:22,750
dimensional portals. His hydrokinesis allows
him to shape whirlpools, geysers, and title

420
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:29,010
surges at will. He shares a telepathic link with
marine life, enabling him to communicate and

421
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:35,390
command sea creatures, like his mentor Aquaman.
Lastly, he is also a seasoned combatant trained in

422
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:41,510
Atlantean martial arts and armed combat. And
that's Tempest. If he could speak to marine life

423
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:48,150
like Aquaman can, then he just seems way better
than Aquaman considering he can do everything his

424
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:54,790
mentor can do and more. I think there would be more
inclined to honor the king of Atlantis over Garth,

425
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:59,590
but yeah, that's probably the only person they
would listen to over him. Seems like the trainee

426
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:05,630
has become the master. I like that. Oh, that's more
than Aquaman now. Considering I always thought

427
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:11,830
like Aquaman's ability to speak to fish was his
like unique defining characteristic. Well, it is

428
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:17,990
in a way. It's sort of like his metahuman ability,
whereas Tempest has to do it through magic. And six

429
00:41:17,990 --> 00:41:29,630
one way, half a dozen the other. I don't know what
that means, but yes. In a world where fantasies

emerge victorious. Visit dynamicpodcast.com
where we settle the debate and settle the score.

437
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:19,450
Well, now that we've got their histories and
abilities out of the way, let's speculate on how

438
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:24,570
one of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The
winner is determined by simulations, not the

439
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:29,390
speculation, but it's fun to imagine how the fight
could play out. AJ9K, what are the rules over

440
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:34,830
speculation? Well, I should say there are no
rules, other than the characters have no prior

441
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:39,610
knowledge of the other going into the fight. All
they are aware of starting out is that the other

442
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:44,750
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.
For the speculation, the contestants will begin

443
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:50,130
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript
environment that will have no bearing on the match

444
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:55,050
itself, as no environmental statistics are
considered in my simulations. The contestants

445
00:42:55,050 --> 00:43:00,870
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright
then, let's get into it. Tempest and Crystal meet

446
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:06,310
on the battlefield? Who goes first? I'm gonna say
that Crystal starts off by igniting some

447
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:11,370
fireballs in her hands and she just hurls them at
Tempest, she throws like six of them and they just

448
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:16,970
melt his face right off. Yeah, except that those
fireballs are blocked by magic, you know, this

449
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:22,350
glowing energy shield that he puts up, which is
then going to shoot out like a handful of purple

450
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:28,610
magic energy shards right at Crystal piercing her
under vital organs. These shards are magic and

451
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:36,490
they come from his magic shield? Sure, yeah. Okay,
Crystal dodges the shards, she's gonna lift into

452
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:42,590
the air with a gust of wind and while she's hovering
in the air, she is gonna form the wind into this like

453
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:48,570
mini cyclone and she feeds it with boulders from
the ground that's below them and she sends the

454
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:54,490
tornado over at Tempest and it just envelops him
and he gets smashed among all the flying boulders

455
00:43:54,490 --> 00:44:00,370
within the mini cyclone, just knocked around like
he's in a clothes dryer. Okay, well as the tornado

456
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:06,670
is coming at Tempest though, he's gonna open a
magic portal at its base and that's gonna cause it

457
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:12,390
just to fill with water. So this water's gonna
quickly spread throughout the tornado and

458
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:17,810
Tempest is gonna freeze it. Okay, so you have this
like frozen tornado and he's gonna shatter it into

459
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:24,530
a million pieces and send those hurtling right at
Crystal just like this hail storm directed right

460
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:30,730
at her like a wall of bullets. Crystal doesn't give
a shit about that, she's the avatar, okay, she just

461
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:36,070
lands back on the ground and she neos that shit like
Neo from the Matrix holds up her hand and all the

462
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:41,750
hail just stops right in front of her freezing
midair and then she's just gonna vaporize all of

463
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:48,390
that water into a thick fog that covers the
battlefield so that Tempest can't see shit and

464
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:54,330
he's looking around for Crystal when all of a
sudden he gets sucked into the ground like he just

465
00:44:54,330 --> 00:45:00,530
stepped into quicksand and sure he can breathe
underwater but like we can't breathe that well in a

466
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:06,430
dust storm so he suffocates in the earth and dies.
But you've forgotten that Tempest has enhanced

467
00:45:06,430 --> 00:45:11,050
senses. He can see at the bottom of the ocean so he
could definitely see Crystal through this fog

468
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:15,950
this whole damn time and I mean I guess that
wouldn't necessarily help him from the quicksand

469
00:45:15,950 --> 00:45:22,010
but that's fine because Tempest is just gonna use
his magic to flood the quicksand with water

470
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:27,570
turning it into like a whirlpool portal which he's
just gonna fall into and he's gonna drop through

471
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:32,510
that portal down through another one that he
formed right behind Crystal right like a badass

472
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:39,270
assassin and he's going to grab her from behind
conjure this magical energy dagger and just

473
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:46,010
assassinate her right there. Okay so he teleports
out of the quicksand? Yes. Okay now if he even lays

474
00:45:46,010 --> 00:45:53,210
his hands on the Crystal he's gonna just combust
into flame okay so he tries to assassinate her but

475
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:58,750
he's too busy burning alive screaming like a
maniac and that fire is gonna like desiccate all

476
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:06,370
the moisture in his body so he's just gonna be a
dried out husk. Oh shit okay um as Tempest is

477
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:13,310
probably on the ground gasping for water he's
going to inscribe atlantian magic runes into the

478
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:19,770
ground and suddenly a tidal wave just comes out of
nowhere and crashes onto the battlefield

479
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:25,690
Crystal's gonna be smashed into the ground and the
whole environment is going to be flooded with

480
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:32,430
water and as she's bruised and broken underwater
that's when she's gonna see Tempest's glowing

481
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:39,670
purple eyes and his right hand glowing with red
energy as he boils the water around her. Alright

482
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:45,210
yeah she's battered from the wave but to keep from
burning she creates an air pocket for herself in

483
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:53,230
the water so she doesn't get touched by the boiling
heat and from her bubble air bubble she ionizes a

484
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:59,050
portion of that air and shoots a lightning bolt
into the water that just electrocutes Tempest. Oh

485
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:07,450
shit okay Tempest he's probably gonna be stunned
by that or or actually Tempest's body magically

486
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:15,330
converts the electricity into his own magic what
he's going to use to fuel an attack he's gonna swirl

487
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:22,130
the water around them into a massive just
devastating hurricane like the biggest one on

488
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:28,210
record a Tempest and that's going to overwhelm
Crystal and as she's trying to like make heads or

489
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:35,230
tails of the environment that's when she's gonna
get blasted with this massive beam of magical

490
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:41,670
eldritch energy just completely disintegrating
her so the match is over. Can he do that can he

491
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:47,530
convert electricity that's running through his
body into magic dude he's learned all kinds of

492
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:53,290
magic tricks studying with atlan and the silent
school if an electric eel can do it i bet he could an

493
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:58,730
electric eel can convert electricity into magic
i'm calling bullshit on that and you're made up

494
00:47:58,730 --> 00:48:08,350
magic it's magic bitch i do what i want. Magic is
stupid okay say Tempest creates a hurricane that

495
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:13,330
doesn't matter to Crystal okay she's the master of
these elements he can try to disintegrate her with

496
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:19,830
a magic beam or whatever but before he can even do
that Crystal is gonna raise a small volcano out of

497
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:26,530
the ground beneath Tempest okay and it's gonna
shoot out this geyser of liquid hot magma all over

498
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:32,830
him and he can't get out because she forms the lava
into a sphere around him and she hardens the

499
00:48:32,830 --> 00:48:37,390
outside of the sphere into obsidian so he's
trapped in this stone prison that's burning him

500
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:44,430
alive and he like no marine animal like an electric
eel or whatever can survive that so he's dead yeah

501
00:48:44,430 --> 00:48:52,150
Crystal wins well i say none of that happened
because Crystal's dead for magic all right we'll

502
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:58,070
go ahead and leave the scenario there one of those
two things happens either Tempest gets burned

503
00:48:58,070 --> 00:49:06,130
alive in a lava prison or Crystal gets
disintegrated by magic energy blast let's go

504
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:11,830
ahead and input the character stats run the
simulations and come back with a winner a g9k hit it

505
00:49:11,830 --> 00:49:18,630
inputting data running calculations processing
results simulations complete all right that was a

506
00:49:18,630 --> 00:49:22,930
really fun match i really like these two
characters they're pretty cool yeah for some

507
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:28,470
reason i thought that crystal would have the
physiological edge here considering that she's

508
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:35,430
inhuman and so she has enhanced physicals but then
you reminded me that Tempest is atlantic and so his

509
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:41,950
physicals are even more enhanced like crystal is
durable Tempest is more durable than that crystal

510
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:47,830
is fast like Olympian fast or maybe even faster
than that considering she can carry herself on

511
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:55,190
gusts of wind but Tempest is known for teleporting
and for being super speedy in the water also

512
00:49:55,190 --> 00:50:00,790
Crystal's just not physically as strong as
Tempest and she's not as good of a fighter as he is

513
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:05,190
because he's been trained in the atlantic and
military well crystal has been trained but you

514
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:11,330
hardly ever see her fight in hand to hand combat i
will say that her damage potential is off the

515
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:17,310
charts sources say that she can control air around
her in a 30 mile radius that's massive that's on the

516
00:50:17,310 --> 00:50:22,730
level of a city and if she can do the same with other
elements like create a massive earthquake on that

517
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:28,210
level then she can easily topple a city if she
wanted to i have seen her raise atlant from the

518
00:50:28,210 --> 00:50:33,230
ground just using her powers so Tempest i don't
think he can really match that also we have to

519
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:39,270
consider that crystal can control the element
that is Tempest's weakness as it were you know heat

520
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:45,210
that can dry him out and burn him alive so she
definitely got the edge there yeah we also

521
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:51,230
downgraded Tempest's damage level somewhat
considering there was nothing besides magic

522
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:57,990
really that he was able to do to hurt her like
conjuring any kind of water whether it was boiling

523
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:03,250
or freezing she was just going to be able to
counteract that yeah it might hurt her for a time

524
00:51:03,250 --> 00:51:08,530
but she would be able to defend herself like if he
put her in a boiling pool or something like that

525
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:14,170
she'd get boiled for a second before she cooled it
right magic was his only leg up they were matched

526
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:20,510
when it came to evasiveness range and perception
the letter of which actually surprised me because

527
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:26,410
you know Tempest has enhanced senses just by
nature of being an atlantian but i guess she has

528
00:51:26,410 --> 00:51:32,110
full like spatial sense of all of the elements yeah
she has elemental awareness basically another

529
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:38,030
thing that surprised me was that she ended up being
more versatile than Tempest which i guess really

530
00:51:38,030 --> 00:51:42,970
shouldn't have surprised me because well he
controls water she controls all of the elements

531
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:49,230
yeah although we did say that Tempest was more
intelligent considering he's one of the most

532
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:56,150
learned sorcerers and all of atlantian history
and crystal is smart you know she's she's fine

533
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:02,310
she's okay she's not as studied as Tempest with all
that said Jonathan who's taken the win here pretty

534
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:10,890
sure it's Tempest i'm not 100% on that but
instagram agrees with me as of this recording 60%

535
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:16,930
of people voted for Tempest to win they don't know
you don't know the only person that knows right now

536
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:26,490
is AJ9K who has the results so AJ9K the results
please here you are sir all right the winner in the

537
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:36,430
duel between Tempest and Crystal is Tempest yes
that does it for this episode i want to thank our

538
00:52:36,430 --> 00:52:42,610
executive producers Nana what's the one
percentage out of 1000 simulated matches Tempest

539
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:51,430
won a lot of them he actually won 752 matches
whereas crystal only won 248 so it was 75.2% over

540
00:52:51,430 --> 00:53:00,450
24.8% that is wild i did not think he was gonna get a
win rate that high it was the physicals and it was

541
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:06,930
the intelligence Tempest is actually pretty
impressive statistically uh whereas crystal you

542
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:13,230
know she has a lot of potential she's very powerful
but she just can't match the overallness of

543
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:21,630
Tempest that is awesome i love that freaking go
Tempest and suck it in humans no the inhumans are

544
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:27,090
gonna be pissed about this result and they're
gonna come out with a fury like the wild cats have

545
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:32,770
never seen in our next episode because of this loss
they're not fucking around clearly you don't know

546
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:38,990
the wild cats i don't know anything about the wild
cats no actually neither do i um i'm gonna learn all

547
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:44,430
about them this upcoming week in preparation for
this team duel yeah definitely can't wait for that

548
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:52,030
