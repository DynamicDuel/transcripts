00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,959
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,142 --> 00:00:28,124
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:28,624 --> 00:00:33,386
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters and stat-based

4
00:00:33,546 --> 00:00:39,890
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother Johnny DC. And in this episode,

5
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:44,412
we are going to find out who'd win in a fight
between the two Native American characters

6
00:00:44,632 --> 00:00:52,091
of Black Condor and Warpath. Warpath being a
member of the X-Men, actually X-Force, and

7
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:58,013
this is kind of a tie into our previous episode
which was a review of X-Men 97. But it's also

8
00:00:58,033 --> 00:01:04,154
a lead up to our future team duel episode of
Outsiders vs X-Force, which is going to be

9
00:01:04,334 --> 00:01:08,516
in September. So look forward to learning more
about X-Force and the Outsiders throughout

10
00:01:08,556 --> 00:01:13,117
these upcoming months. Before we input the character
stats and run simulations to find out which

11
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:16,688
character would win in a fight. we're gonna
break down the latest comic book movie news

12
00:01:16,728 --> 00:01:20,792
to come out this past week. Of which there was
just one news item, we learned about who the

13
00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:26,878
writers are gonna be for the upcoming Lanterns
DCU television series. As always, we list our

14
00:01:26,918 --> 00:01:30,581
segment times in our episode description, so
feel free to check out the show notes if you

15
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:35,366
wanna skip ahead to a particular topic. Our
artificially intelligent duel simulator, AJ-9K,

27
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:56,133

00:02:56,153 --> 00:03:01,111
heroes from film and television against each

29
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:06,115
week for the show's third season premiere, this
time pitting Starro the Conqueror from the

30
00:03:06,155 --> 00:03:12,300
Suicide Squad against Legendary's King Kong.
On the Senjou World podcast, host Zachary Hepburn

31
00:03:12,561 --> 00:03:17,945
speculates on fights between fan favorite anime
and manga characters. This Thursday for the

32
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:23,469

37
00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:54,941
But with that out of the way, quick to the no
prize. A no prize is an award Marvel used to

38
00:03:54,961 --> 00:04:00,346
give out to fans. Our version, the dynamic duel
no prize, is a digital award we post on Instagram

39
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:05,449
for the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week's question

40
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:10,671
was, who's your favorite robot superhero or
villain from Marvel or DC and why? And this

41
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:15,373
is coming off of the news that the upcoming
Vision series from Marvel Television will be

42
00:04:15,413 --> 00:04:21,015
coming out in 2026. We got four answers, so
let's break down this week's honorable mentions

43
00:04:21,035 --> 00:04:26,717
before revealing the no prize winner. Our first
honorable mention goes to Abner O'Terry. Who

44
00:04:26,757 --> 00:04:34,397
said? Hey guys, what's up? It's Abner O'Terry.
And my answer is obviously Robot from The Doom

45
00:04:34,438 --> 00:04:41,241
Patrol because, uh, he's awesome. You can't
get better than a punk-rocking robot. He's

46
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:47,945
the best. What the fuuuuck? It's Robotman! But
I agree, he's awesome. He's probably my favorite

47
00:04:47,985 --> 00:04:53,008
personal robot character as well. I still remember
when I was first becoming a DC fan, I had gotten

48
00:04:53,028 --> 00:04:57,931
my first cell phone and I said Robotman. as
my wallpaper, because I just like the idea

49
00:04:57,971 --> 00:05:03,255
of carrying Robotman around. Is he a punk rock
robot or is he more, you know, heavy metal?

50
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:10,279
Heavy metal for sure. Great answer Abner. Our
next honorable mention goes to Miggy Matangian,

51
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:16,644
who said, Hey, what's up guys? This is Miggy
and my favorite robot superhero. Does it count

52
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:22,187
as a superhero? It's more of a sidekick. I guess
that counts. It's Geetz. Booster Gold's like

53
00:05:22,428 --> 00:05:28,532
robotic sidekick from the 25th century. He's
just like very sarcastic and a lot smarter

54
00:05:28,552 --> 00:05:33,675
than Booster Gold. So it's just a funny like
relationship between the two of them. Yeah,

55
00:05:33,715 --> 00:05:38,179
excited to see him in the live action show.
Wonder who they'll get to voice him. To the

56
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:44,824
sweat drips down my balls. All these bitches
call. Ah, skeet skeet, motherfucker. Ah, skeet

57
00:05:45,124 --> 00:05:49,227
skeet. How dare you disrespect skeet's name?
Mickey's right. He's a pretty cool robot. He's

58
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:54,566
a great foil and companion to Booster Gold because
I think. of how they play up on the fact that

59
00:05:54,606 --> 00:05:59,968
he knows more than Booster Gold, who is often
depicted as kind of dumb. Miggie was wondering

60
00:06:00,008 --> 00:06:03,710
who will voice Skeets in the upcoming Booster
Gold television series. What do you think?

61
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:09,872
Honestly, I think you could get away with doing
a voice actor that I think you need a celebrity

62
00:06:09,932 --> 00:06:14,494
voice. And in that regard, I don't think you
could do better than Billy West, who did the

63
00:06:14,534 --> 00:06:20,377
voice of Skeets the Robot for the Justice League
Unlimited animated show. Yeah, Billy West is

64
00:06:20,397 --> 00:06:25,231
fantastic. He does the voice of Fry in Futurama.
and literally dozens of other voices. There's

65
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:28,674
no time to throw up. He's the red M&M. Yeah,
yeah, there you go. Maybe one day we'll get

66
00:06:28,694 --> 00:06:34,739
around to doing a duel with Skeets. Who knows?
Ah, Skeet, Skeet. Let's go to move on to the

67
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:40,723
next answer given by Christopher Manotti who
said. Hi guys, Christopher Manotti. As a DC

68
00:06:40,743 --> 00:06:45,807
fan, I have to say Red Tornado. I really like
this character. He's not your typical kind

69
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:51,615
of robot that shoots lasers and hacks into stuff.
His power is literally generating tornadoes.

70
00:06:51,735 --> 00:06:56,039
I think that's pretty cool. I also think his
character is really interesting. I especially

71
00:06:56,079 --> 00:07:02,524
liked in the Young Justice show when you find
out that he built another body for himself

72
00:07:02,584 --> 00:07:07,908
so that he could experience humanity. Really
cool. Yeah, Red Tornado I would say is probably

73
00:07:07,948 --> 00:07:13,612
one of the most powerful androids out there.
He has a very complicated backstory, you know,

74
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:19,204
coming from the Tornado Tyrant, which was...
a literal tornado villain from the planet ran.

75
00:07:19,604 --> 00:07:24,027
If you guys aren't familiar with him, we did
a duel between him and Sandman, which was pretty

76
00:07:24,067 --> 00:07:29,851
cool, I thought. It's interesting to have a
robot character who is so elemental. He's very

77
00:07:30,231 --> 00:07:34,454
bound to the earth and very natural in that
regard, considering he's basically a sentient

78
00:07:34,494 --> 00:07:40,118
tornado. But also, he's like the pinnacle of
technology. So there's an interesting dichotomy

79
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:44,521
to that character. Yeah, for sure. Great answer,
Christopher. But the winner of this week's

80
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,695
Snow Prize is... Travis Herndon who said,

81
00:08:12,138 --> 00:08:15,900
Well, you're talented in your opinion, but you're
gonna get throat chopped from me if you're

82
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,844
saying that. And I will second that throat chop.
Yeah, anybody who hates on Baymax is lying

83
00:08:20,864 --> 00:08:24,687
to themselves and deserve to be throat chopped.
I don't know if I would consider Baymax to

84
00:08:24,707 --> 00:08:30,551
be as iconic as the Terminator or R2-D2, but,
you know, I think he's probably a class just

85
00:08:30,671 --> 00:08:35,314
under that. Okay, Mr. Robot Popularity Expert,
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

86
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:40,490
Baymax is awesome. He's one of the more unique
robots out there and it's- really interesting

87
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:45,453
considering that he is also a superhero and
a healthcare robot. There's a dichotomy to

88
00:08:45,493 --> 00:08:50,095
him as well. And he has a one of a kind personality.
Like what are you talking about man? He's all

89
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:54,858
the way up there in terms of the upper echelon
of pop culture robots. And he's a Marvel character.

90
00:08:55,098 --> 00:08:59,381
So bonus points. Yeah, I figured we were going
to give the win to the one person who didn't

91
00:08:59,421 --> 00:09:06,225
respond with a DC answer. That's right. Honestly,
I just don't want to get throat chopped. Well,

92
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:10,930
too bad. It's gonna happen. Great answer Travis,
you win this week's no prize. If you the listener

93
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,715
won a shot at winning your own no prize, stay
tuned till later on this episode when we'll

94
00:09:14,735 --> 00:09:19,181
be asking another question of the week. And
now that that's done, on to the news!

95
00:09:24,974 --> 00:09:32,639
Okay, so last week DC Studios CEO James Gunn
confirmed on Instagram that the Lanterns showrunners

96
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:40,644
would be Damon Lindelof from Watchmen and Lost
Fame and Chris Mundy, the showrunner of Ozark

97
00:09:40,944 --> 00:09:46,928
and former writer for shows like Criminal Minds,
Cold Case, Bloodline, and True Detective. Which,

98
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:51,752
it's funny that the show has always been pitched
as True Detective in space and they actually

99
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:56,587
got a writer from True Detective to work on
the show. I've never seen Ozark, but I hear

100
00:09:56,607 --> 00:10:01,432
that it's really good. I have seen Watchmen
by Damon Lindelof, and that's essentially,

101
00:10:01,452 --> 00:10:06,476
in my opinion, the greatest television series
for Marvel or DC that has ever been made. The

102
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:11,561
thing won so many Emmys, it won a freaking Peabody,
it doesn't get better than this writing duo.

103
00:10:11,981 --> 00:10:18,808
I'm not gonna lie, I'm kinda insane with jealous
rage right now at these like God tier showrunners

104
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:23,736
for this show. It's gonna be incredible. I think.
David Lindelof did a fantastic job with the

105
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:27,958
Watchmen series. The way that he brought that
story into the modern era in a sequel series

106
00:10:27,978 --> 00:10:32,602
was exceptionally done. And I think with these
guys working on the show, DC fans really have

107
00:10:32,622 --> 00:10:38,205
nothing to worry about. Oh no, this has like
easily become with this news, like my most

108
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:44,430
anticipated project from the upcoming DCU. This
show is going to be so high brow, like Game

109
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,693
of Thrones quality, I suspect. It sounds like
it's going to be way better than what Greg

110
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:53,196
Berlanti was coming up with. Don't get me wrong,
shows like Arrow and The Flash were good, but

111
00:10:53,516 --> 00:10:59,742
they're no The Leftovers, they're no Watchmen,
they're no Ozark from what I've heard. What's

112
00:10:59,782 --> 00:11:05,026
really cool though is that they're not only
showrunning the series, but Chris Mundy, Damon

113
00:11:05,066 --> 00:11:10,431
Lindelof, and acclaimed comic book writer Tom
King also wrote the pilot script and the show's

114
00:11:10,491 --> 00:11:15,576
Bible. Which if you're not familiar with that,
it's basically the entire background, history,

115
00:11:15,836 --> 00:11:21,408
and premise of the show. So it sounds like they're
really in charge of DC's like cosmic universe

116
00:11:21,468 --> 00:11:26,631
as it were. And that's amazing. Sounds like
Green Lantern is finally, finally going to

117
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:32,494
get his due. Not on this big screen, I guess,
but you know, at least on a screen that's non-animated.

118
00:11:32,854 --> 00:11:37,257
Well, the cool thing is that it's going to tie
into the movies that we will see on the big

119
00:11:37,297 --> 00:11:42,079
screen. It'll take place in the same universe.
Super, super excited by this news. It sounds

120
00:11:42,099 --> 00:11:46,730
like it's going to be so much more prestige
than I thought it would be. We don't have a

121
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:51,011
release date for this show yet. Considering
the writing talent, I'm sure the show is gonna

122
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:56,633
be very, very expensive. So it'll probably be
a while before we get it. Maybe 2026, I'm guessing.

123
00:11:57,134 --> 00:12:00,355
I can't wait for it. And I'm really looking
forward to finding out like who's gonna be

124
00:12:00,395 --> 00:12:05,136
the lead characters. Is it gonna be Hal Jordan,
John Stewart, Guy Gardner? We don't know yet.

125
00:12:05,477 --> 00:12:07,337
But that brings us to our question of the week.

126
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:17,486
Who is your favorite Green Lantern? And why?
Record your answer at dynamicduel.com by clicking

128
00:12:21,389 --> 00:12:25,873
you to leave us a voicemail. Your message could
be up to 30 seconds long, and don't forget

129
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:30,216
to leave your name in case we include you on
the podcast. We'll pick our favorite answer

130
00:12:30,556 --> 00:12:35,480
and award that person a Dynamic Duel No Prize
that we'll post to Instagram. Be sure to answer

131
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,141
before June 8th.

132
00:12:44,686 --> 00:12:48,071
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode. So let's go ahead and get into

133
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:54,761
our main event, where we find out who would
win in a fight between Black Condor and Warpath.

134
00:13:10,038 --> 00:13:15,139
Alright, Black Condor versus Warpath. These
are two Native American superheroes going head

135
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:20,300
to head and lead up to our upcoming team duel
coming out in a few months of Outsiders versus

136
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:26,042
X-Force. Now, Warpath, you guys may know from
the comics, if you read the comics, but if

137
00:13:26,102 --> 00:13:31,323
you are more familiar with just the movies,
he was in X-Men Days of Future Past. He was

138
00:13:31,383 --> 00:13:36,945
part of the future X-Men team that was basically
getting slaughtered by the Sentinels. Yeah,

139
00:13:36,965 --> 00:13:42,416
and we've never seen Black Condor in live action.
Though he was in some animated films, direct

140
00:13:42,436 --> 00:13:48,442
to video film about the Rey, a DC character,
and of course he'll be featured in the upcoming

141
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:53,206
Crisis on Infinite Earths Part 3 film. Only
one version of the character has been Native

142
00:13:53,226 --> 00:13:58,311
American though, right? Yes, yeah. There's been
four different versions of Black Condor. I'm

143
00:13:58,351 --> 00:14:03,796
going with the Native American Navajo version
because he seems to be not only the most popular

144
00:14:03,836 --> 00:14:08,659
because he's been in different media. but also
he is the current mainstream version of the

145
00:14:08,699 --> 00:14:13,161
character in DC's Prime Continuity. The character
of Black Condor though didn't actually start

146
00:14:13,301 --> 00:14:18,443
off as a DC Comics character. He was a part
of Quality Comics, which was eventually purchased

147
00:14:18,503 --> 00:14:25,266
by DC Comics. Black Condor is a creation of
Will Eisner, actually. Oh, fascinating. What

148
00:14:25,306 --> 00:14:31,089
other characters are from Quality? Uncle Sam,
Phantom Lady, Doll Man, The Ray, basically

149
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:34,890
all of the Freedom Fighters. Oh, interesting.
Well, I'm glad you're going with the Navajo

150
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:40,071
version. It's cool to get all this representation
from the Native American tribes because Warpath

151
00:14:40,111 --> 00:14:47,093
is Apache. And then we also have Forge, who's
Cheyenne. And then you have Echo, who's Choctaw

152
00:14:47,233 --> 00:14:51,054
in the MCU. But in the comics, she's from the
Blackfoot tribe. Oh, and then you have like

153
00:14:51,074 --> 00:14:56,036
Khori from What If, who's part of the Mohawk
tribe. Yeah, Black Condor can take all of them

154
00:14:56,116 --> 00:15:03,117
on. OK, OK. Come at me, bro. He's not even going
to be able to take on Warpath. So nice tray.

155
00:15:03,518 --> 00:15:08,041
Okay, to explain the methodology behind our
duels, let's go to our sentient duel simulator,

156
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:13,446
Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K, tell our listeners
how you go about determining a winner in our

157
00:15:13,486 --> 00:15:18,530
duel matchups. Yes, of course, sir. The way
I determine a winner between the contestants

158
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:24,595
is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations using
the characters statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation

159
00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:30,360
is a probabilistic model used to determine outcomes
through random sampling. In this case, I randomize

160
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:35,816
the statistics along a as a way to simulate
the many variables that can occur during battle.

161
00:15:36,216 --> 00:15:40,960
The stat parameters are based on the official
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters'

162
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,164
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat
categories are included such as range, damage

163
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:51,608
potential, versatility and perception in order
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.

164
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:56,911
The results of the 1000 simulations provide
a percentage of wins for each character. The

165
00:15:56,952 --> 00:16:01,387
contestant with the higher percentage is declared
the victor as they have a higher probability

166
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:07,252
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,
neither character should win 100% of the matches.

167
00:16:07,772 --> 00:16:12,256
The comic book stories have shown that there's
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so

168
00:16:12,296 --> 00:16:16,159
the confidence rate of my method falls in line
with the precedents that have been established

169
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:21,764
in the source material. My mathematical simulations
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are

170
00:16:21,784 --> 00:16:27,589
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes
tabulated for determination of the winner.

171
00:16:27,609 --> 00:16:31,962
Thanks, Adrien NK! Before we run the simulations
though, we like to break down each character's

172
00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:36,844
histories and abilities before improvising a
scenario on how we imagine one of the 1000

173
00:16:37,164 --> 00:16:42,406
simulations would play out beat for beat. And
it's my turn to go first with the Marvel characters

174
00:16:42,426 --> 00:16:49,128
backstory, so let me tell you guys all about
the X-Man Warpath. James Proudstar was born

175
00:16:49,168 --> 00:16:55,149
to Neil and Maria Proudstar on the Apache Native
American Reservation in Camp Verde, Arizona.

176
00:16:55,682 --> 00:17:01,185
James idolized his older brother John Proudstar,
who was a skilled athlete and decorated United

177
00:17:01,225 --> 00:17:07,088
States Marine. Upon John's return from military
duty back to the reservation, James witnessed

178
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:11,771
his brother's mutant ability manifest for the
first time when he saved the life of a little

179
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:17,074
girl by wrestling a charging bison to the ground.
John was soon discovered by Professor X using

180
00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:23,757
Cerebro and was recruited into the latest iteration
of the X-Men team, taking on the codename Thunderbird.

181
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:29,607
Alongside new recruits such as Storm, Wolverine,
Nightcrawler, Colossus, Sunfire, and Banshee,

182
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:34,829
Jon helped rescue the original X-Men members
from the Sentient Island nation of Krakoa.

183
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:40,150
You can learn more about the X-Men, Inner Titans
vs X-Men team duel, and more about Krakoa in

184
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,792
its duel against Danny the Street. In Jon's
next X-Men mission, he prevented the evil Count

185
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:51,713
Nefaria from escaping in a small aircraft by
jumping onto it and smashing it mid-air until

186
00:17:51,753 --> 00:17:56,896
it exploded. It was an act that bravely, but
unfortunately, sacrificed his life for the

187
00:17:56,936 --> 00:18:01,819
team. James was devastated upon learning of
his older brother John's death and blamed the

188
00:18:01,999 --> 00:18:07,702
X-Men. Although John was to be buried with military
honors, James stole his brother's body and

189
00:18:07,742 --> 00:18:13,105
gave him a traditional Apache warrior funeral,
in that moment swearing vengeance on Professor

190
00:18:13,365 --> 00:18:19,588
X and manifesting his own mutant abilities,
the very same as his brother's. James was approached

191
00:18:19,648 --> 00:18:25,193
by and joined the Hellions. which was a rival
mutant team to the X-Men, led by the Hellfire

192
00:18:25,213 --> 00:18:30,117
Club's White Queen, Emma Frost, whom you can
learn more about in her duel against Poison

193
00:18:30,217 --> 00:18:35,235
Ivy. James took on the codename Thunderbird
to honor his brother's memory, and went on

194
00:18:35,255 --> 00:18:39,537
to fight the X-Men out of vengeance, but learned
in the course of their battle that Professor

195
00:18:39,677 --> 00:18:45,098
X was not responsible for John's death, and
that John died as a true hero and warrior.

196
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:49,800
James declined an invitation to join the New
Mutants and returned to the reservation with

197
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,914
his vendetta abandoned. Many years later, while
on a trip to New York, James was approached

198
00:18:55,034 --> 00:19:00,076
by the mutant Cable, who wanted to recruit him
onto his strike force team called X-Force.

199
00:19:00,576 --> 00:19:05,578
Though James initially declined, he returned
home to the reservation to find everyone slaughtered,

200
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:10,781
and joined the X-Force under the new code name
Warpath in an effort to discover who the killer

201
00:19:10,821 --> 00:19:16,043
was. During his tenure on the team, he developed
his powers to increase his mutant-enhanced

202
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:21,305
strength and senses, and began a relationship
with fellow X-Force member Siren, the daughter

203
00:19:21,345 --> 00:19:26,805
of Banshee. Eventually, James learned who murdered
his people at the reservation. It was Cable's

204
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:32,990
clone from the future named Strife, who at the
time was dead. James was soon killed and journeyed

205
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:38,053
into hell itself to seek revenge against Strife,
fighting him alongside the X-Force who were

206
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:44,338
brought into the realm by Valkyrie to save James'
soul. In the end, X-Force won, returning James

207
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:49,826
back to life. You can learn more about Cable
in his duel against Booster Gold. Soon after,

208
00:19:50,006 --> 00:19:55,189
James and the rest of the X-Force found themselves
caught in a vibranium bomb explosion that seemingly

209
00:19:55,229 --> 00:20:00,331
killed the group. In reality, they survived
the attack and clandestinely prevented an alien

210
00:20:00,391 --> 00:20:06,299
invasion. During that time, James' powers began
to fluctuate. temporarily giving him the power

211
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:12,585
to fly, and also removing his ability to speak
at one point. However, eventually, his powers

212
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:17,430
returned to normal. After the Scarlet Witch
was driven mad and used her reality-warping

213
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:22,695
powers to remove the abilities of mutants around
the world, James was fortunate enough to retain

214
00:20:22,735 --> 00:20:28,200
his abilities and joined a new iteration of
X-Force where he was gifted vibranium knives

215
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:33,664
by Storm and Black Panther. The new team was
tasked with completing missions deemed too

216
00:20:33,704 --> 00:20:39,068
secret or extreme for the main X-Men to handle.
One of X-Force missions was to defeat a horde

217
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:45,092
of resurrected mutants turned evil by the Black
Queen, Selene. One of the revived mutants being

218
00:20:45,172 --> 00:20:50,937
James' brother, John. James had to kill his
brother in an act of mercy and ended up killing

219
00:20:51,017 --> 00:20:56,120
Selene by stabbing her in the chest with her
own dagger, freeing the souls of the resurrected

220
00:20:56,200 --> 00:21:01,308
mutants she was controlling. James then left
X-Force to later join the X-Men on their new

221
00:21:01,408 --> 00:21:07,233
island base of Utopia off the coast of San Francisco.
James was later captured by the secret government

222
00:21:07,273 --> 00:21:12,897
project called Weapon X for experimentation.
However, he was rescued alongside other captives

223
00:21:12,997 --> 00:21:18,441
by a future version of Wolverine, and the group
took on the name Weapon X, serving as a mutant

224
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:24,025
rescue squad. While on the team, James developed
a romantic relationship with the mutant Domino.

225
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:28,935
However, he left when Old Man Logan stepped
down from leadership and Sabertooth took over

226
00:21:28,975 --> 00:21:33,856
to turn the team into a mercenary squad. You
can learn more about Wolverine, Domino, and

227
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:39,158
Sabertooth in their respective duels against
Hawkman, Harley Quinn, and Killer Croc respectively.

228
00:21:39,618 --> 00:21:43,879
James joined the majority of Earth's mutants
in creating their new mutant nation on the

229
00:21:43,939 --> 00:21:49,281
sentient island of Krakoa. There, he joined
former new mutants members including Mirage,

230
00:21:49,421 --> 00:21:53,975
Magic, and Wolfsbane, in helping train young
mutants living on the island on how to control

231
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:59,737
their new powers. While there, James' brother
John was able to be resurrected as Professor

232
00:21:59,918 --> 00:22:05,160
X, Magneto, and the other heads of Krakoa had
developed a system of mutant resurrection using

233
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,562
a combination of mutant powers including mass
generation, reality warping, time manipulation,

234
00:22:10,802 --> 00:22:15,784
and genetic and psychic archiving. Though initially
fearing to meet his brother out of fear that

235
00:22:15,825 --> 00:22:21,567
he had somehow failed to live up to him, James
and John finally reunited and left Krakoa to

236
00:22:21,627 --> 00:22:27,669
return to the reservation together. After Krakoa
was attacked by the anti-mutant terrorist organization

237
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:33,632
Orcus, James and John's Apache Reservation became
a makeshift mutant refugee camp. And that's

238
00:22:33,692 --> 00:22:39,234
Warpath's backstory. Powers-wise, Warpath has
an enhanced mutant physiology that grants him

239
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:45,817
increased strength, able to lift a maximum of
75 tons, increased speed, able to run 100 miles

240
00:22:45,877 --> 00:22:51,628
per hour, Nearing Vulnerability and Increased
Agility. In the event he is injured, he has

241
00:22:51,668 --> 00:22:56,911
an increased healing speed. Warpath also has
enhanced senses, including hearing, smelling,

242
00:22:56,971 --> 00:23:02,594
and seeing at great distances, and night vision.
He also has some mystic senses, allowing him

243
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:08,137
to perceive supernatural energies. Warpath is
a highly skilled hand-to-hand fighter and wields

244
00:23:08,237 --> 00:23:14,220
two large daggers made out of vibranium. Finally,
while he was able to fly for a period of time

245
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,840
when his powers were temporarily in It seems
as if he is sometimes still able to tap into

246
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:25,043
that power. It's unclear, but it's an ability
that's rarely used at best. So for the purposes

247
00:23:25,103 --> 00:23:29,947
of the speculation and the simulations, I'm
gonna treat his flight power as more like a

248
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:35,631
vast leaping ability, which seems more true
to the spirit of the character. If he is a

249
00:23:35,651 --> 00:23:40,714
flyer, he's not a skilled or practiced one.
And those are his powers. Yeah, I'm not gonna

250
00:23:40,734 --> 00:23:46,478
lie, that character is not as interesting as
Black Condor. What are you talking about? You

251
00:23:46,498 --> 00:23:51,741
don't like the brother aspect with Warpath and
his brother Thunderbird? Not really. Well,

252
00:23:51,841 --> 00:23:59,725
you are just a horrible brother then. How about
that? Sure, but I think you'll get what I'm

253
00:23:59,765 --> 00:24:04,748
talking about when I go over Black Condor's
backstory, which actually begins in the Golden

254
00:24:04,788 --> 00:24:11,132
Age of Comics. Now, when archaeologist Richard
Gray and his wife were killed by bandits during

255
00:24:11,172 --> 00:24:18,448
an expedition in Mongolia, their orphaned son,
Richard Gray Jr. was raised by an unusually

256
00:24:18,508 --> 00:24:24,393
intelligent race of Condors, from whom the young
Richard seemingly learned to fly, though it

257
00:24:24,413 --> 00:24:30,217
was later revealed that his powers derived from
his metahuman abilities of telepathy and telekinesis.

258
00:24:30,797 --> 00:24:34,080
As Richard grew into a young man- Seriously,
raised by Condors? That's a better backstory.

259
00:24:34,901 --> 00:24:39,444
That's a freaking fantastic golden age origin.
Does not get more golden age than that. Now

260
00:24:39,484 --> 00:24:45,631
as Richard grew into a young man- A hermit named
Father Pierre found and educated Richard, teaching

261
00:24:45,671 --> 00:24:51,514
him survival skills and worldly knowledge. After
Father Pierre's death, Richard became the costumed

262
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:57,277
adventurer Black Condor, designing a black outfit
with glider wings to resemble the birds that

263
00:24:57,297 --> 00:25:01,999
had saved his life. After tracking down and
killing the Mongolian bandits that murdered

264
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:08,061
his parents, Richard traveled to America, where
he assumed the identity of Senator Thomas Wright.

265
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:13,644
his doppelganger, after Richard failed to stop
a plot to assassinate the senator. After some

266
00:25:13,684 --> 00:25:19,568
time fighting crooked politicians, Richard joined
the Freedom Fighters during World War II, led

267
00:25:19,608 --> 00:25:25,431
by the personified spirit of America known as
Uncle Sam, which later became part of a larger

268
00:25:25,471 --> 00:25:31,154
team known as the All-Star Squadron, which fought
the Nazis in Europe. The Freedom Fighters eventually

269
00:25:31,234 --> 00:25:36,657
ended up in an alternate universe known as Earth-X,
where the Axis powers successfully conquered

270
00:25:36,697 --> 00:25:41,767
the world. After two and a half decades of fighting
the Nazis, Richard and the Freedom Fighters

271
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:46,829
were eventually able to end the war with help
from the Justice Society and the Justice League

272
00:25:46,849 --> 00:25:51,351
of America, teams you can learn more about in
their team duels against the Fantastic Four

273
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:57,354
and Avengers respectively. Though Richard traveled
to the main DC universe, Earth-1, to continue

274
00:25:57,394 --> 00:26:02,836
his superhero career as the Black Condor, he
eventually returned to Earth-X to help rebuild

275
00:26:03,116 --> 00:26:08,800
the war-torn world that had become his home.
A new black condor emerged years later, named

276
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:15,125
Ryan Kendall. For over 200 years, the Kendall
family and their associates, known as the Society

277
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:21,050
of the Golden Wing, had pursued the dream of
creating a flying man. Initially, their methods

278
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:25,774
were harmless, but as their obsession grew,
so did the macabre nature of their experiments.

279
00:26:26,195 --> 00:26:31,639
By the early 20th century, their attempts had
become brutal and inhumane, and they continued

280
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:39,011
to fail. By the 1960s, The society turned to
mutation, irradiating the womb of Ryan's mother

281
00:26:39,111 --> 00:26:45,753
to ensure her child would be born with tailored
genetic mutations. The child, Ryan, grew up

282
00:26:45,953 --> 00:26:50,974
isolated under the care of his grandfather,
Creighton Kendall, the Golden Wing Society's

283
00:26:51,074 --> 00:26:57,116
leader. For 20 years, Ryan underwent various
chemical, radioactive, and physical treatments,

284
00:26:57,656 --> 00:27:03,174
and on his 21st birthday, the final and most
significant treatment left him in a coma instead

285
00:27:03,194 --> 00:27:08,738
of achieving the society's desired outcome.
Ryan was sent to a special care facility, an

286
00:27:08,778 --> 00:27:14,941
asylum for the society's failed subjects, where
for two years while in a coma, he was fully

287
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:20,244
aware of his surroundings and learned about
the true twisted nature of the society. Upon

288
00:27:20,284 --> 00:27:26,248
awakening, feeling betrayed and violated, Ryan
fled and eventually settled in New Jersey's

289
00:27:26,348 --> 00:27:32,815
Pine Barrens, living as a hermit. There he befriended
a park ranger named Ned David Smith, who was

290
00:27:32,855 --> 00:27:38,696
a Delaware Native American who helped Ryan adjust
to life outside of isolation. Ned suggested

291
00:27:38,736 --> 00:27:44,678
the name Black Condor, reflecting Ryan's dark
and predatory nature. Although reclusive and

292
00:27:44,738 --> 00:27:51,260
reluctant to embrace the role of a hero, Ryan,
as the Black Condor, had an instinctive, heroic

293
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,541
nature, fighting alongside other superheroes
such as Hawkman and eventually joining a new

294
00:27:56,601 --> 00:28:01,946
incarnation of the Freedom Fighters. Ryan was
later killed by Sinestro alongside other freedom

295
00:28:01,966 --> 00:28:07,008
fighters when they were ambushed by the secret
society of supervillains. Though Ryan would

296
00:28:07,048 --> 00:28:12,770
return briefly as a black lantern during the
Blackest Night event, a Navajo man named John

297
00:28:12,810 --> 00:28:18,311
Trujillo would later claim the black condor
mantle after he was gifted elemental powers

298
00:28:18,431 --> 00:28:24,353
from the Mesoamerican deity Tokadol, also known
as the Spider Woman, whose webbing holds the

299
00:28:24,393 --> 00:28:29,256
fabric of the universe together. He was not
his tribe's first to bear the Black Condor

300
00:28:29,316 --> 00:28:36,442
title, as nearly 150 years earlier, U.S. Colonel
Kit Carson raided a Navajo stronghold within

301
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:42,127
the Arizona canyons, forcing its citizens to
march 300 miles east for a resettlement in

302
00:28:42,147 --> 00:28:47,791
what was known as the Long Walk. Many Navajo
died along the way, and their bodies were feasted

303
00:28:47,831 --> 00:28:54,111
upon by Black Condors, or vultures. Those who
survived believed the Black Condors were rescuing

304
00:28:54,151 --> 00:29:00,294
the souls of those who died to return them to
the Arizona canyons. When the Navajo eventually

305
00:29:00,374 --> 00:29:05,436
did return to the canyons, they faced attacks
from cattlemen who wanted to steal their land.

306
00:29:05,796 --> 00:29:11,019
When a young man begged to coddle for help,
like she did with John Trujillo, she imbued

307
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,021
him with the powers of the Black Condor to protect
his people. John fought alongside the Freedom

308
00:29:16,061 --> 00:29:21,262
Fighters in his first mission, and continues
as a member of the team in DC's Prime continuity.

309
00:29:21,723 --> 00:29:26,904
With the re-emergence of the multiverse, the
Nazi-controlled Earth-X returned, along with

310
00:29:26,964 --> 00:29:32,806
a new version of the Freedom Fighters to combat
them with a new black condor named Marcus Robbins.

311
00:29:33,226 --> 00:29:39,107
Born to contemporary black slaves working in
a Detroit industrial complex who dreamed they

312
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:44,289
could fly away from their indentured servitude.
After Marcus and his father secretly built

313
00:29:44,329 --> 00:29:49,920
a prototype of mechanical wings, and the Nazis
found out about it, Marcus's father forced

314
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:56,245
him to fly away to save himself while his parents
were taken and never seen again. Marcus became

315
00:29:56,325 --> 00:30:01,368
a legend among the Detroit workers known as
the Black Condor, and after joining the Freedom

316
00:30:01,408 --> 00:30:07,012
Fighters, Marcus returned to Detroit and led
a revolt among the black community there against

317
00:30:07,092 --> 00:30:12,376
the Nazis. For this duel, I'll be going with
the current Prime Universe version of Black

318
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:17,821
Condor, John Trujillo. in part because the executive
producers felt that version was the best one

319
00:30:17,841 --> 00:30:23,848
to compete against Warpath. Powers-wise, most
versions of Black Condor have had low-level

320
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:30,234
telekinesis, which not only enabled them to
fly, but also emit telekinetic bursts. Since

321
00:30:30,294 --> 00:30:36,701
John Trujillo is divinely empowered rather than
a metahuman, his power manifests as aerokinesis.

322
00:30:37,142 --> 00:30:42,426
allowing him to manipulate the wind so that
he can fly at great speeds using his biological

323
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:49,131
wings and create gales or whirlwinds. John also
draws power from the earth, granting him increased

324
00:30:49,211 --> 00:30:55,236
strength and durability. He's also a trained
warrior. That's Black Condor. Uh, yeah, none

325
00:30:55,276 --> 00:31:00,580
of those origins were better than Warpaths.
Come on! None of them? Brotherly love, man.

326
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,098
Oh my gosh. Brotherly love. is not a greater
story than overcoming Native American oppression

327
00:31:07,358 --> 00:31:12,043
and slavery. I'm sorry. Well, I'm not going
to argue against that, but also you're still

328
00:31:12,063 --> 00:31:20,232
a bad brother. Also, I learned something today.
I guess a condor is a vulture. Yeah, I never

329
00:31:20,252 --> 00:31:25,397
knew that. I actually learned that today too.
Total mind blow.

330
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:38,574
Where fantasies collide and heroes clash, one
podcast network rises above the rest. Prepare

Visit dynamicpodcast.com where we settle the
debate and settle the score.

337
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:23,812
But now that we got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

338
00:32:23,852 --> 00:32:29,675
of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not the speculation,

339
00:32:29,956 --> 00:32:35,318
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could
play out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?

340
00:32:36,219 --> 00:32:40,221
Well, I should say there are no rules, other
than the characters have no prior knowledge

341
00:32:40,241 --> 00:32:44,623
of the other going into the fight. All they
are aware of starting out is that the other

342
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:50,810
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.
The contestants will begin approximately 50

343
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:56,053
meters apart in a nondescript environment that
will have no bearing on the match itself, as

344
00:32:56,113 --> 00:33:01,055
no environmental statistics are considered in
my simulations. The contestants must earn victory

345
00:33:01,075 --> 00:33:05,937
on their own merit." Alright, then let's get
into it. Black Condor and Warpath meet on the

346
00:33:05,957 --> 00:33:12,539
battlefield. Who goes first? I'm gonna say that
Warpath goes first, because he's better. He's

347
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:18,306
like, he just has a better name. Like Warpath.
That's badass. Black Condor... You know, like

348
00:33:18,346 --> 00:33:22,309
vultures, they just wait around, you know? So
Warpath's going first. They're symbols of death.

349
00:33:22,529 --> 00:33:27,874
Like you're walking around and you see a vulture.
Yeah, you're going to be freaked out. Warpath

350
00:33:27,934 --> 00:33:32,318
is going to show how freaked out he is by entreating
his vibranium daggers from behind his back.

351
00:33:32,698 --> 00:33:38,002
And he's just going to charge at Black Condor
like a bison, like 100 miles per hour. And

352
00:33:38,423 --> 00:33:42,907
he's going to jam both of his knives right into
Black Condor's chest. You don't think Black

353
00:33:42,947 --> 00:33:49,854
Condor sees Warpath charging at him with those
knives? Like. What is he a joke to you? Obviously

354
00:33:49,934 --> 00:33:54,956
Black Condor sees Warpath charging at him at
a hundred miles per hour. Like it would only

355
00:33:54,976 --> 00:33:59,797
take Warpath literally a second to cover a 50
meter distance at that speed. A hundred miles

356
00:33:59,837 --> 00:34:04,819
per hour, is that supposed to be fast? By the
time Warpath gets to within say like 10 meters

357
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:10,220
of Black Condor, Black Condor is just gonna
spread his wings and trap Warpath in this tornado

358
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,341
that he generated. And that's gonna launch him
just spinning high into the air, at which point.

359
00:34:15,714 --> 00:34:20,416
Black Condor, he's just gonna fly up and plow
right into Warpath at full speed with his fists.

360
00:34:20,937 --> 00:34:25,979
Is that even gonna hurt Warpath? Like how strong
is Black Condor? Dude, Black Condor, not only

361
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:32,023
can he, you know, fly really fast to like increase
the impact of this blow, but he's also strong

362
00:34:32,063 --> 00:34:38,046
enough to like crack force fields. Okay. I don't
even know how to quantify that, but we'll say

363
00:34:38,066 --> 00:34:43,389
that Black Condor flies up, punches Warpath,
Warpath gets rocked higher up into the air.

364
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:50,133
But Warpath's a badass, he doesn't care. He's
gonna recover from the punch and he's gonna

365
00:34:50,233 --> 00:34:56,436
skydive back down toward Black Condor, straightening
his body for a high-speed dive. And he's just

366
00:34:56,456 --> 00:35:01,919
gonna tackle Black Condor out of the air, slamming
him right into the ground and jamming his daggers

367
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:07,002
right into his kidneys. Actually, Black Condor,
he's pretty maneuverable in the air, so I'm

368
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:11,765
gonna say he just shifts out of the way a little
bit from Warpath's dive and Warpath's just

369
00:35:11,785 --> 00:35:22,986
gonna fall to his death. Oh shit! I mean, no,
no. Warpath's gonna land on the ground into

370
00:35:23,026 --> 00:35:28,169
the superhero landing pose. You know, like one
fist on the ground while kneeling like a badass,

371
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:33,432
and he's immediately gonna stand up and chucks
one of his knives like a bullet right at Black

372
00:35:33,472 --> 00:35:38,435
Condor ripping through one of his wings and
forcing him to like spiral down and crash into

373
00:35:38,455 --> 00:35:44,222
the ground. Damn! Okay, that was a good move.
I mean, he wouldn't crash because like he could

374
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:49,004
just generate a gust of wind beneath him before
he hits the ground. So that's what he's going

375
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:53,526
to do here. And now that Black Condor is on
the ground, he's going to summon up a wind

376
00:35:53,586 --> 00:35:59,429
that's going to lift debris generated from Warpath's
superhero landing. And he's going to use those

377
00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:06,892
stones to just pummel Warpath like hailstones.
That would not hurt Warpath at all in the slightest.

378
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:11,506
He just smacks those pebbles away like they're
annoying flies or something like that. And

379
00:36:11,646 --> 00:36:17,129
that's when he hurls his second knife right
at Black Condor's face. Just whack sticks right

380
00:36:17,169 --> 00:36:22,652
in there headshot. OK, except that the knife
is blown with the wind gust down right into

381
00:36:22,672 --> 00:36:27,395
the ground at Black Condor's feet, allowing
him to pick up the knife. And that's when Black

382
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:33,779
Condor is going to use the wind like a vacuum
on Warpath and just like suck him in towards

383
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:40,311
him and stick him with his own knife. Um, I.
I guess that a vibranium knife would be able

384
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:45,954
to pierce Warpath. Yeah, it would. But they're
up close and personal now, and Warpath is gonna

385
00:36:46,034 --> 00:36:51,357
grab Black Condor's wrists and force him to
pull the knife out of him, like, I don't know,

386
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:55,200
say his shoulder or whatever. And that's when
Warpath's healing factor is gonna kick in.

387
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:00,283
It's just gonna seal that wound right up. Good
as new. I totally forgot that he has a healing

388
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:06,526
factor. As Warpath is holding onto Black Condor's
wrists... He's gonna headbutt him right in

389
00:37:06,546 --> 00:37:11,507
the face, which is gonna cause Black Condor
to stumble back a step and he's gonna drop

390
00:37:11,547 --> 00:37:18,269
the knife. And that is when Warpath follows
up with a flying dropkick straight to Black

391
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:23,311
Condor's jaw, laying the fool out cold. Because
there's no way he's durable enough to take

392
00:37:23,331 --> 00:37:29,272
a hit like that. Dude, Black Condor is as durable
and strong as the ground he stands on. So yeah,

393
00:37:29,292 --> 00:37:35,170
he could take it. And while Warpath's on the
ground. Before he can get up from his drop

394
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:40,592
kick, Black Condor is just gonna pin him down
onto the ground with this mighty wind that's

395
00:37:40,632 --> 00:37:46,015
also gonna pull the arrow from Warpath's lungs.
That's gonna suffocate him and end this fight.

396
00:37:46,135 --> 00:37:50,456
So match over. No, Warpath can just hold his
breath. He just holds his breath for a minute.

397
00:37:50,777 --> 00:37:55,078
He's fine and he's gonna summon the strength
to reach out and grab his knife that Black

398
00:37:55,098 --> 00:38:01,321
Condor dropped. And you know, since all this
wind is pushing him down, Warpath is gonna

399
00:38:01,581 --> 00:38:06,552
punch the ground really hard. creating this
like small tremor that causes Black Condor

400
00:38:06,572 --> 00:38:12,117
to lose his bearings long enough for Warpath
to at least get to his knees from where he

401
00:38:12,157 --> 00:38:17,522
just uppercut slashes Black Condor up the middle,
you know, slicing him right in two. That's

402
00:38:17,542 --> 00:38:22,927
how you match over. Lose his bearings? Black
Condor is like really graceful, like a bird.

403
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:29,653
But I guess we'll leave it there. Either Black
Condor suffocates Warpath by pulling the air

404
00:38:29,673 --> 00:38:35,957
from his lungs. or Warpath slices Black Condor,
scrote to throat with one of his knives. And

405
00:38:35,977 --> 00:38:40,459
then he scalps him, because that's what the
Apache did. I think they did that, yeah. Wow.

406
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,322
But we'll find out which of these scenarios
happens by inputting the character stats and

407
00:38:44,362 --> 00:38:50,165
then running a thousand simulations and coming
back with a winner. AG9K, hit it! Inputting

408
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:56,549
data, running calculations, processing results,
simulations complete. All right, I like this

409
00:38:56,589 --> 00:39:02,718
matchup. This was an idea by the executive producers.
I believe Devin Davis submitted this idea for

410
00:39:02,738 --> 00:39:07,302
a duel match and it was not one that I had in
consideration. I was thinking like other strong

411
00:39:07,342 --> 00:39:13,327
guys to go up against Warpath since he's essentially
X-Force's or one of X-Force's resident muscle

412
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:17,331
men. But really I didn't know anything about
Black Condor. I didn't know how strong Black

413
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:22,355
Condor was. All he knew was that he had wings
that could allow him to fly. Honestly, I didn't

414
00:39:22,375 --> 00:39:26,622
know much about Black Condor either. He's a
pretty obscure character. But you know, he

415
00:39:26,642 --> 00:39:30,384
gets his name dropped every once in a while.
I definitely like this John Trujillo version

416
00:39:30,524 --> 00:39:33,826
more than the others, I would say. I've been
looking forward to getting him into a duel

417
00:39:34,146 --> 00:39:38,829
at some point. I did like this matchup. Yeah,
it was closer than I would have thought, too,

418
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:43,272
considering, you know, the slightly different
power sets where Black Condor had a little

419
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:48,255
bit more in terms of speed and evasiveness because
of his flight. Warpath was a little bit higher

420
00:39:48,315 --> 00:39:52,517
in terms of durability and strength. They kind
of evened each other out in a lot of areas.

421
00:39:53,034 --> 00:39:58,156
Warpath also had higher perception due to his
enhanced senses, but Black Condor had higher

422
00:39:58,196 --> 00:40:02,999
marks on range because he could create gusts
of wind that cover entire city blocks. Yeah,

423
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:07,141
neither character were very versatile and they
also matched up pretty evenly when it came

424
00:40:07,181 --> 00:40:12,664
to things like fighting skill and damage level.
With all that in consideration, who do you

425
00:40:12,684 --> 00:40:17,907
think's taking the win on this one, Jonathan?
It's gotta be Black Condor. I mean, he has

426
00:40:18,007 --> 00:40:22,662
almost everything going for him that Warpath
does in terms of strength and durability. but

427
00:40:22,702 --> 00:40:28,304
he has the added bonus of being able to fly
and control the wind. I put up the Instagram

428
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:33,487
poll very, very late, like right before we began
recording this episode. Usually I do a day

429
00:40:33,507 --> 00:40:39,529
before. Right now, the poll is sitting at 50
in terms of who people think will win. So that

430
00:40:39,569 --> 00:40:45,132
doesn't help. No, I'm actually surprised that
Black Condor has that many votes, though, considering

431
00:40:45,172 --> 00:40:50,626
I feel like Warpath is the more popular character.
Is he, though? I feel like most people know

432
00:40:50,646 --> 00:40:55,269
who Thunderbird is, if they know him at all,
because he's fairly obscure as well. When you

433
00:40:55,309 --> 00:41:01,112
say Warpath, I'm like, who? Thunderbird's brother.
Well, like there was a version of Thunderbird

434
00:41:01,332 --> 00:41:06,375
in the Gifted series as well, which was a spinoff
from the X-Men on Fox. The one that no one

435
00:41:06,415 --> 00:41:12,559
watched? Yeah, the one that I didn't even watch.
Okay. Well, Instagram polls aside, let's go

436
00:41:12,579 --> 00:41:19,018
ahead and get the results and find out who won.
AG9K, the results please. Hey, Yuasa. Alright,

437
00:41:19,058 --> 00:41:31,323
the winner between Black Condor and Warpath
is... Warpath. Fuck! Sucks to suck! Warpath

438
00:41:31,403 --> 00:41:37,586
beat Black Condor 539 times out of a thousand
matches, meaning Black Condor only won 461,

439
00:41:39,047 --> 00:41:45,966
so Warpath wins 53.9% and Black Condor only
wins 46.1% of the time. What the hell? gave

440
00:41:46,006 --> 00:41:50,307
him the win. I thought Black Condor was coming
out on top here. Well, the biggest disparity

441
00:41:50,327 --> 00:41:54,829
between the two characters was in two stats.
One of them was durability, which Warpath was

442
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:59,931
higher in, and the other one was range, which
Black Condor was higher in. But then Warpath

443
00:42:00,051 --> 00:42:05,614
eked out a small victory when it came to perception
and strength. Stupid enhanced senses. I feel

444
00:42:05,654 --> 00:42:10,756
like Black Condor should have enhanced senses.
Like, it makes sense for the character to have

445
00:42:10,796 --> 00:42:16,422
that. He just hasn't had enough appearances
in the comics for them to establish that. Yeah,

446
00:42:16,782 --> 00:42:22,244
well the comics have established that between
Warpath's enhanced reflexes and senses, it

447
00:42:22,264 --> 00:42:27,767
makes him an absolute marksman with his throwing
knives. And you know, considering how fast

448
00:42:27,807 --> 00:42:31,628
he can throw, I just don't think that Black
Hunter would stand a chance. Warpath is just

449
00:42:31,688 --> 00:42:40,212
too strong and too much of a badass and too
cool and too powerful and too awesome and too

450
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:43,573
just good in general. Holy shit, why don't you
marry him already?

451
00:42:47,002 --> 00:42:51,785
Nah, I'm good. You say Warpath is cool, but
like, I just remember him getting his ass beat

452
00:42:51,825 --> 00:42:59,250
in Days of Future Past. Yeah, by those future
Sentinels. Like a lame ass. Black Houndour

453
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:03,232
would not have gone down that quick. Yeah, you
probably would have flown away or something.

454
00:43:03,672 --> 00:43:09,236
Like a coward. Bitch, you don't know his life.
I mean, except for the fact that you literally

455
00:43:09,256 --> 00:43:14,478
just told me his life, so there you go. Dang
it. But that does it for this duel guys, let

464

just got done reviewing X-Men 97, which brought
us back to the old X-Men the animated series.

465
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,786
Now we're going to journey back on the DC side
of things with a review of Batman Mask of the

466
00:44:08,826 --> 00:44:13,088
Phantasm. Yeah, it's a great movie, I never
had the opportunity to see it in theaters,

467
00:44:13,348 --> 00:44:17,450
but I'm glad we're finally getting around to
reviewing it. It's a classic. But that does
