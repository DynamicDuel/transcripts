00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,957
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:30,954
Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we
review superhero films and debate the superiority

3
00:00:30,974 --> 00:00:37,058
between Marvel and DC by comparing their characters
in stat-based battle simulations. I'm Johnny

4
00:00:37,098 --> 00:00:43,582
DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous Joe.
And in this episode, we will be reviewing part

5
00:00:43,662 --> 00:00:50,547
three of DC's Justice League Crisis on Infinite
Earths animated film. It is the conclusion

6
00:00:50,827 --> 00:00:57,115
of not only the trilogy of Crisis films, but
also... of the tomorrow verse as a whole. Good

7
00:00:57,195 --> 00:01:03,897
riddance is what I say. You know, I wasn't with
you early in the tomorrow verse, but I'm there.

8
00:01:04,358 --> 00:01:10,720
I'm right there. Of course, we're going to be
talking about the film later on in this episode.

9
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:15,062
Actually, you know what? I lied. It's going
to be right now because this is a short episode.

10
00:01:15,122 --> 00:01:20,204
It's sort of the column before the storm that
is Comic Con. Joseph's going on vacation this

11
00:01:20,244 --> 00:01:25,584
week, so we're recording this episode really
early. and we're pretty much gonna just get

12
00:01:25,664 --> 00:01:30,091
right into it. Yep, yeah, we're gonna skip over
the no prize because we only got two answers

13
00:01:30,151 --> 00:01:34,458
by the time we started recording this episode.
So we're gonna give you guys another week for

14
00:01:34,638 --> 00:01:36,361

00:03:57,832 --> 00:04:01,776
But with all of that out of the way, now let's
move on to the main event of this episode,

42
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,985
where we review Justice League. Crisis on Infinite
Earths, part two.

43
00:04:23,278 --> 00:04:27,720
The final crisis on Infinite Earth's Part III,
as I mentioned earlier, is the conclusion to

44
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:34,445
a trilogy of films that in themselves are the
conclusion to a 10-part DC animated film series

45
00:04:34,745 --> 00:04:41,710
known as the Tomorrowverse, which began with
Superman Man of Tomorrow in 2020. The Tomorrowverse

46
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:50,236
in itself follows a 16-film animated universe
from DC, officially known as the DC Animated

47
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:57,008
Movie Universe that began with 2013's Justice
League The Flashpoint Paradox and ended with

48
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:04,013
2020's Justice League Dark Apocalypse War. You've
already lost me. No, I haven't. You know what

49
00:05:04,033 --> 00:05:09,296
I'm talking about. Though I will admit, maybe
some people don't. And that's the problem.

50
00:05:09,697 --> 00:05:16,601
Basically, DC has had two long-running animated
movie universes. The initial major one was

51
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:20,664
the DC animated movie universe, which was 16
films, and then the most recent one, which

52
00:05:20,704 --> 00:05:26,019
started in 2020, was the Tomorrowverse. Sort
of. It's actually recently been revealed that

53
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:32,222
the Tomorrowverse is in fact considered to be
a part of the DC animated movie universe, just

54
00:05:32,302 --> 00:05:39,845
its second phase, or the second story arc as
it were. And I'm not gonna lie, I hate that.

55
00:05:41,026 --> 00:05:47,469
I thought Justice League Dark Apocalypse War
was a perfect conclusion. We rated it 5 stars

56
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:53,055
in our review. And while Crisis Part III doesn't
diminish Apocalypse War as I was afraid it

57
00:05:53,095 --> 00:05:58,876
was going to while watching it, it does make
it all the more obvious that the Crisis trilogy

58
00:05:59,096 --> 00:06:05,138
is nowhere close to being as good of a film.
In fact, I'd say each film in the Crisis trilogy

59
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:10,900
got subsequently worse, which is unfortunate,
because I wanted the Tomorrowverse to be good.

60
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,321
And with its conclusion dropping the ball, I
feel like the Tomorrowverse in its entirety

61
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:22,030
is kind of pointless and better off forgotten.
Well, it's strange because it introduced the

62
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:27,875
concept of the multiverse to DC animation, right?
And at the conclusion of this film, that's

63
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:34,841
all gone now. So you largely have an exercise
in redundancy, I guess. I'm afraid that this

64
00:06:34,882 --> 00:06:39,025
is what's going to happen to the Marvel multiverse
saga, is that when all is said and done...

65
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:44,478
after the events of Avengers Secret War and
everything is perhaps collapsed into one universe

66
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:49,143
again, a lot of people are going to feel like
these whole series of Marvel phases were pointless.

67
00:06:49,303 --> 00:06:55,008
Yeah, that's, you should be afraid. You should
be very afraid. Because clearly that's possible.

68
00:06:55,409 --> 00:07:00,173
Now I've recommended some Tomorrowverse films
in the past and if you've gotten to this point

69
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:06,130
in the universe based on my recommendations,
I just want to apologize. I'm not going to

70
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:10,851
recommend this film, but just in case you plan
on watching it for yourself and want to avoid

71
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:16,073
spoilers, I'd probably stop listening to this
episode now, then come back later and finish

72
00:07:16,113 --> 00:07:20,974
it once you've seen the movie. You may have
been spoiled on something already, just go

73
00:07:20,994 --> 00:07:27,916
with it, it's fine. Now I was excited for this
film initially, I thought Crisis Part 1 was

74
00:07:28,016 --> 00:07:34,755
really interesting and Part 2 was a decent enough
setup for what I had hoped. would be a conclusion

75
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:40,199
as epic as Justice League Dark Apocalypse War,
but what I got instead was actually almost

76
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:46,805
an hour and a half of people just talking. Like,
there was little to no action and not against

77
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:52,290
any kind of threat that you actually cared about.
That's true. I don't think a single punch was

78
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,273
thrown in this movie. You know, there were a
lot of like beams being fired and stuff like

79
00:07:56,293 --> 00:08:00,477
that, but it was primarily against the anti-monitor.
They did fight some dinosaurs, which I thought

80
00:08:00,497 --> 00:08:05,047
was kind of weird. But yeah, little to no action,
which I think is the major downfall. Like the

81
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:08,708
movie could have been serviceable. Yes, there
was a lot of exposition, a lot of talking and

82
00:08:08,728 --> 00:08:13,589
stuff like that. But I think its biggest crime
was that it wasn't entertaining from a superhero

83
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:18,991
action standpoint, which is what people watch
these movies for. It's why the genre exists.

84
00:08:19,151 --> 00:08:24,233
Yeah, I mean, that's fair. I don't necessarily
always need to be entertained as long as the

85
00:08:24,273 --> 00:08:30,622
story is good and is captivating. But that was
not the case here. It definitely suffers from

86
00:08:30,662 --> 00:08:34,444
a villain problem, you could say. You know,
in the first film, there was a mezzo in the

87
00:08:34,484 --> 00:08:41,045
crime syndicate. In the second, there were shadow
demons and psycho pirates. In the third, there

88
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:47,407
was the anti-monitor? Though I'm hesitant to
even call him that because none of the characters

89
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:52,689
ever did in the film, and he bears little to
no resemblance to the anti-monitor from the

90
00:08:52,729 --> 00:08:58,891
comics. This is more of like a shadow demon.
Megazord of sorts, but without any of the character

91
00:08:58,991 --> 00:09:04,754
or motivation that was teased in conversations
with Psycho Pirate in part two. Right, yeah,

92
00:09:04,774 --> 00:09:08,796
they hinted at some characterization of the
Anti-Monitor, like you said, toward the end

93
00:09:08,816 --> 00:09:13,798
of part two, but here he was more like a force
of nature, the Anti-Monitor, and there were

94
00:09:13,838 --> 00:09:20,081
like dozens of him, or like millions, I guess.
Right, exactly. Yeah, I wanted that motivation.

95
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,672
that hint of it that I saw in part two, but
that never materialized into anything. And

96
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:29,494
I think there was a huge, huge downfall for
this film. Now I've said in the past that if

97
00:09:29,514 --> 00:09:34,197
you're going to adapt the crisis on infinite
earth's comic storyline to a film, you first

98
00:09:34,237 --> 00:09:40,360
need to establish a cinematic multiverse beforehand.
For anyone not familiar with the comic storyline

99
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:46,124
from the eighties, it was a way for DC comics
to consolidate the continuity from their golden

100
00:09:46,204 --> 00:09:51,690
and silver age comic stories, which had been
established. as existing within separate but

101
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:58,292
parallel universes, a multiverse which was revealed
to contain a near infinite number of Earths.

102
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:04,974
On Earth 1 you had the Justice League, on Earth
2 you had the Justice Society, on Earth 3 the

103
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:10,195
heroes were villains and the villains were heroes,
Earth 5 was home to the Charlton Comics characters

104
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:14,836
that DC had acquired, Earth S was home to the
Fawcett Comics characters,

105
00:10:18,966 --> 00:10:25,929
so on and so forth. By the Tomorrowverse's second
film, Justice Society World War II, the multiverse

106
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:32,013
was established and it was something most subsequent
films continue to build upon in anticipation

107
00:10:32,253 --> 00:10:38,076
for this concluding trilogy. Now a lot of people
have not loved the Tomorrowverse. From the

108
00:10:38,116 --> 00:10:44,540
beginning, I praised the character designs,
but story-wise, other than a fantastic adaptation

109
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,946
of Batman the Long Halloween and a decent Green
Lantern film, The Tomorrowverse wasn't really

110
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:55,628
good enough to build any kind of anticipation,
and the approach to adapting the crisis storyline

111
00:10:55,688 --> 00:11:02,790
across three films was inconsistent at best
and super confusing at worst, because the first

112
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:09,292
two films kind of play loose with time and don't
follow a linear narrative structure. This one

113
00:11:09,352 --> 00:11:15,694
does. I wasn't anticipating that, and it was
kind of disappointing. Now, unfortunately,

114
00:11:15,834 --> 00:11:22,117
I wouldn't be surprised if most audiences found
the film super confusing and inaccessible because

115
00:11:22,157 --> 00:11:27,219
it requires you to have knowledge of animated
projects outside of the existing Tomorrowverse

116
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:32,961
films. Not only do they reference Justice League
Dark Apocalypse War, but they have homages

117
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:39,144
to Super Friends, Teen Titans, and The Timverse,
which includes Justice League, the animated

118
00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:44,967
series, and Batman, the animated series. The
thing is, though, Even if you're a fan of those

119
00:11:44,987 --> 00:11:50,151
shows, the brief cameos they offer really weren't
enough to get excited about, except for maybe

120
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:56,497
the final performance of Kevin Conroy as Batman
and Mark Cowell's Joker in that homage. But

121
00:11:56,797 --> 00:12:03,463
otherwise, yeah, I was not impressed. I agree.
I do want to take a moment to highlight Kevin

122
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:08,448
Conroy's final performance, though. If you're
going to go out with a bang, that is how you

123
00:12:08,488 --> 00:12:13,206
do it. The scene between his Batman... and Mark
Hamill's Joker, you know, it was less than

124
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:18,428
a minute long. But the dialogue between the
two of Batman realizing that his universe was

125
00:12:18,468 --> 00:12:24,869
coming to an end and to decide to go out fighting
the Joker was perfection. And I'm so glad that

126
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:30,471
Kevin Conroy got that opportunity as his final
performance, because it was very touching and

127
00:12:30,511 --> 00:12:35,092
probably honestly the best part of this film.
Hands down, it was the best part of this film.

128
00:12:35,512 --> 00:12:43,043
It was so meta and yet so epic and even cathartic
in a way. Yeah. If you find the clip online,

129
00:12:43,543 --> 00:12:47,486
that's all you need to watch from this film,
essentially, is what I'm saying. It's a great

130
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:51,689
clip. You guys should watch it if you decide
not to watch the film. But even then, the Batman,

131
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:56,832
the animated series homage, along with the other
homages and so many things in this trilogy

132
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:02,416
felt shoehorned. For sure. You know what it
reminded me of? It reminded me of DC's attempt

133
00:13:02,516 --> 00:13:07,380
to explore the multiverse in the Flash movie,
the live action Flash movie that came out with

134
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,559
Ezra Miller, how we saw all these different
worlds with like, you know, Adam West's Batman

135
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:17,001
and George Reeve's Superman and Christopher
Reeve's Superman. It was a nice little wink

136
00:13:17,021 --> 00:13:23,725
and nod for fans of the DC comics and DC media,
but it's hollow because there's no real substance

137
00:13:23,745 --> 00:13:28,087
there. Like just showing them and not having
them be really a part of the story is kind

138
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:33,290
of a waste and it's not substantial enough.
It's cheap. It's cheap. It's a cheap way to

139
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:38,153
get you excited. And I'll be honest, I loved
that scene in the Flash. The more I look back

140
00:13:38,213 --> 00:13:43,408
on it, the more I don't like it as much. I think
it was probably just the experience of seeing

141
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:47,851
it in the theater that really made me enjoy
that. And I definitely did not get that same

142
00:13:47,871 --> 00:13:52,154
kind of feeling watching this version of it
because this was like you said, essentially

143
00:13:52,394 --> 00:13:58,939
the animated version of that. It was just thrown
in there as were a ton of characters, like

144
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:03,562
they introduced us to a modern black canary,
just so she and green arrow can essentially

145
00:14:03,682 --> 00:14:09,398
wink at each other. And that's basically it.
They introduced us to the losers, which Okay,

146
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:14,639
kind of unnecessary and obscure. They teased
Darkseid, but we didn't get to see a new version

147
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:21,161
of him either. The Losers thing actually surprised
me because I realized that there was no DC

148
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:25,923
showcase short that came out in the time of
the Tomorrowverse that did not in some way

149
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:31,404
tie into this crisis series of films. Every
short had a purpose, whether it was Commandy

150
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:38,494
or The Losers or Constantine House of Mystery.
Right. it was all kind of required viewing

151
00:14:38,634 --> 00:14:45,496
for full enjoyment of these crisis films. Exactly,
yeah. And if you think it's hard to get people

152
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:50,637
to watch Marvel Disney Plus television shows
that tie into films, look at how the Marvel's

153
00:14:50,677 --> 00:14:55,619
movie performed because it required so much
Disney Plus viewing, such as WandaVision and

154
00:14:55,659 --> 00:15:01,200
Miss Marvel and Secret Invasion to enjoy that.
Try getting people to watch the DC Showcase

155
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,081
shorts. I don't think anybody really watches
those. Of course we review them on this podcast,

156
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:12,092
They're some of our least listened to episodes,
you know? Yes. By far. So kudos to the people

157
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:17,795
who actually watch the DC Showcase shorts and
are big enough fans to basically consume all

158
00:15:17,815 --> 00:15:21,236
the media that DC is throwing at them. I think
you guys are the ones that are going to get

159
00:15:21,276 --> 00:15:25,798
the most out of this movie and everyone else
is just going to be left so cold. But even

160
00:15:25,838 --> 00:15:31,040
if they did watch the Losers short, it's not
like there's any kind of payoff here. They

161
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,250
mentioned that they're just a bunch of losers
and that's it. Like it's kind of cool to see

162
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:41,434
Aquaman fight a dinosaur, but it's a very fleeting
moment in a film that feels very long. Both

163
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:49,138
of my daughters and my wife fell asleep during
this movie, and I wanted to. I think the third

164
00:15:49,218 --> 00:15:53,760
act was the best part, though. Really? I was
not happy with the third act. I actually liked

165
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:58,323
the first act the most. The first act was a
bunch of randomness because they were in the

166
00:15:58,363 --> 00:16:04,174
Bleed universe where the laws of physics did
not apply. So it was just... Yeah, it was very

167
00:16:04,695 --> 00:16:10,119
chaotic and strange. Whereas the third act wrapped
everything up, kind of, and answered a lot

168
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:16,084
of questions. Yeah, I guess, but it wrapped
everything up in an underwhelming way. Like,

169
00:16:16,164 --> 00:16:21,789
everything about this film to me was so underwhelming
and unsatisfying. The only redeeming quality

170
00:16:21,969 --> 00:16:28,214
I really have to comment on, besides the Kevin
Conroy cameo, is the film's ambition. Like

171
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:33,677
creating a 10 film universe for the sole purpose
of adapting the Crisis on Infinite Earth storyline

172
00:16:34,137 --> 00:16:40,481
is no easy task because it requires the filmmakers
to capture the same sense of shock and awe

173
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:48,225
that readers initially had when decades of storytelling
culminated in this epic story with unbelievable

174
00:16:48,305 --> 00:16:53,909
stakes. It was the infinity war and end game
of its time. And while most of the films in

175
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:59,008
the Tomorrowverse probably worked really well
on paper. As we've mentioned in our past reviews,

176
00:16:59,348 --> 00:17:03,891
when you see the final product, all you can
do is hope that they get it right the next

177
00:17:04,011 --> 00:17:09,315
go-round. Except this time, there won't be.
And I guess all I'm left with is the hope that

178
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:15,139
James Gunn can do better when DC's next animated
universe begins with Creature Commandos next

179
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,622
year. That is definitely a good thing that you
can say about this film is that at the end

180
00:17:18,642 --> 00:17:24,178
of the day, it gives you hope, again, that something
better will come along next time. That said,

181
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:28,680
I have faith that James Gunn will be able to
put out a better product. Yeah, same. And honestly,

182
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:34,103
like James Gunn was going to do that whether
this film provided closure to an existing animated

183
00:17:34,163 --> 00:17:38,746
universe or not. So there's not much solace
in the fact that this sets up something new

184
00:17:38,786 --> 00:17:45,510
because it was going to happen anyway. Now usually
in our reviews, we have a character breakdown.

185
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:51,733
And I'll be honest, there's really no character
arcs in this film to break down. Like sure

186
00:17:51,753 --> 00:17:58,257
there are. character moments that are cathartic
in some way, but those characters also only

187
00:17:58,297 --> 00:18:02,660
have like two lines in the entire movie. I think
the character with the most development was

188
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:09,205
probably Constantine. Yeah, you could say that.
His story really revolves around his past actions

189
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:14,568
that resulted in the creation of the multiverse,
him and the Flash, but a lot of it is just

190
00:18:14,608 --> 00:18:20,412
really exposition. I'm not sure if he learns
anything. He does get to move on to the afterlife

191
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:26,584
at the But other than that, yeah, not much more
to say. Well, he tried to sacrifice himself,

192
00:18:26,644 --> 00:18:32,348
which felt very unconstantine-like, but the
dream machine or whatever that was. The miracle

193
00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:37,812
machine. Honestly, I don't remember what that's
from. That was the one thing that had me scratching

194
00:18:37,832 --> 00:18:43,096
my head. Oh, that was from the Legion of Superheroes.
You remember when Supergirl had to make a wish

195
00:18:43,396 --> 00:18:48,199
at the very end and like reality kind of split.
It was a weird scene. Is that the thing that

196
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:52,870
Brainiac was using to try to take over the universe?
Yes. Okay, alright, yeah, I remember what it

197
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:58,953
is now. But it was strange because for some
reason, the dream machine was outside of time

198
00:18:58,973 --> 00:19:04,495
and space, and yet the bleed dimension was also
outside of time and space, and I don't know,

199
00:19:04,755 --> 00:19:09,578
there were a lot of disparate elements that
seemed a little convenient in terms of being

200
00:19:09,678 --> 00:19:14,160
able to withstand the destruction of the primary
universe. Right, and you're referring to the

201
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:19,306
end of the film. The thing is, though, at that
point, they're outside of the bleed. They are

202
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:25,129
on the monitor's spaceship, which exists between
dimensions, but they're also on war world,

203
00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:31,673
which also exists between dimensions. But they
say that the miracle machine exists between

204
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:36,816
dimensions. So it's like, what, how many in
between dimensions are there? Yeah. It seems

205
00:19:36,836 --> 00:19:40,638
like there's a lot of different places to go
to escape the anti-monitor is all I'm saying,

206
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:45,081
especially when you don't have someone like,
like sleuth or ratting you out, you know? Right.

207
00:19:46,538 --> 00:19:50,960
I guess the only other character worth mentioning
was Supergirl. Of course her arc kind of continues

208
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,783
from the past film, but for a majority of this
film she basically just feels guilty for killing

209
00:19:55,863 --> 00:20:01,726
the monitor and at the end decides to sacrifice
herself because she feels responsible for the

210
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:06,268
predicament that all of the Earths find themselves
in. So it was inevitable, you know, she died

211
00:20:06,308 --> 00:20:10,791
in the comic storyline as well. Totally saw
it coming. The one character that should have

212
00:20:10,811 --> 00:20:13,112
had more backstory I feel like was Batman.

213
00:20:16,194 --> 00:20:20,637
dick to everyone, didn't learn his lesson, and
then for some reason at the end of this film

214
00:20:20,657 --> 00:20:26,682
he's like, oh, I'm going to lose you all kind
of in a way. And it's like, okay, buddy. All

215
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:31,066
right. Yeah, we never really saw that growth.
Not at all. Which is a shame because Jensen

216
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:35,690
Ackles was a good Batman. Actually a lot of
the cast was good here. I just want to make

217
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,994
that shout out. Jensen Ackles as Batman, Megan
Donnelly as Supergirl, Darren Criss as Superman,

218
00:20:41,475 --> 00:20:46,398
and Stan Akadik as Wonder Woman. I will miss
this voice cast for sure. And Matt Ryan came

219
00:20:46,418 --> 00:20:51,442
back, who has always in my mind been the perfect
voice for Constantine. And this is like for

220
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:55,464
sure, for sure the last time we're probably
going to hear him as the character. So that's

221
00:20:55,624 --> 00:21:00,568
a little bittersweet. Yeah, yeah, I do wish
his dialogue was better. I wish the character

222
00:21:00,588 --> 00:21:04,590
was written better. Definitely not as good as
Apocalypse War, but that would be a challenge

223
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:09,633
in and of itself. A few things are as good as
Apocalypse War, right? Right, fair.

231
00:22:04,442 --> 00:22:09,004
Let's move on to the story highlights. The film
begins with the heroes of the multiverse attacking

232
00:22:09,044 --> 00:22:14,586
the Anti-Monitor, successfully damaging him
with light-based attacks, though he adapts

233
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:19,968
and generates armor to protect himself. Before
the Anti-Monitor can fully charge up and project

234
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:25,531
an antimatter wave, the Monitor, having just
been fatally burned by Supergirl's heat vision

235
00:22:25,931 --> 00:22:27,912
with his dying breath, sends the

236
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:36,994
where the anti-monitor can't find them. I wonder
why he didn't do that to begin with. Why did

237
00:22:37,014 --> 00:22:40,737
he wait until the moment of his death to send
everyone to the bleed where they were more

238
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:49,885
safe? Oh, cause he sucks. That's the only reason
I don't know. All right. It seemed like a last

239
00:22:49,905 --> 00:22:55,149
ditch effort, but it was also the best way to
protect so many earths that had been destroyed

240
00:22:55,189 --> 00:22:59,744
by this point. I think maybe he didn't want
to do it because it was a last ditch effort,

241
00:22:59,964 --> 00:23:04,528
knowing the chaos that would befall the different
Earths if he did. Oh, you mean due to the lack

242
00:23:04,608 --> 00:23:10,693
of laws of physics? Right, quantum physics specifically.
I guess Lex Luthor did mention in the movie

243
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:15,536
that all the Earths were going to eventually
die due to these catastrophic events, so maybe

244
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:20,060
that's the answer to why the monitor didn't
do this in the first place. Right, right, exactly.

245
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,159
Like I said, it was a last ditch effort. Now,
flashing forward eight months, Superman of

246
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:30,963
Earth-1 and Hawk Girl find Wonder Woman adrift
in the bleed and bring her aboard their ship,

247
00:23:31,303 --> 00:23:36,487
explaining that they found her tiara floating
in the interdimensional space and suspected

248
00:23:36,527 --> 00:23:43,172
her immortality allowed her to survive the Anti-Monitor's
antimatter wave from the previous film. After

249
00:23:43,232 --> 00:23:48,515
reuniting with Earth-2 Superman, Wonder Woman
is taken to the Monitor ship, where she learns

250
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:55,337
that because the bleed exists outside of space-time,
Both space and time are in flux across the

251
00:23:55,377 --> 00:24:01,162
surviving worlds, making it a challenge to protect
and provide for the survivors. Wonder Woman,

252
00:24:01,342 --> 00:24:07,668
the Superman, and others then rescue the inhabitants
of Earth-1 from dinosaurs that emerged from

253
00:24:07,709 --> 00:24:13,134
a chronal anomaly along with the losers. Now
does this movie imply that there was only one

254
00:24:13,214 --> 00:24:18,574
Wonder Woman in the multiverse? It kind of seemed
that way. Right, because then you would have

255
00:24:18,774 --> 00:24:23,837
a whole multitude of Wonder Women surviving
the destruction of their universe due to the

256
00:24:23,877 --> 00:24:29,781
antimatter wave. Which to me is dumb, because-
It's bullshit. Wonder Woman has never been

257
00:24:29,861 --> 00:24:34,643
immortal. I mean, immortal, yes, in the sense
that she doesn't age, or like ages very slowly,

258
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:40,707
and may not die from aging. But the fact that
she could survive antimatter when so many other

259
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:46,342
things in the universe couldn't, makes me wonder
why she gets to be so special. Yeah, none of

260
00:24:46,362 --> 00:24:50,963
the other Themyscirans or even like the Olympian
gods or anything else that was around in that

261
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:56,964
universe were able to outlive its destruction.
But she was. So dumb, I hated that. They used

262
00:24:56,984 --> 00:25:01,686
that at the end though, implying that like because
she was immortal she had like almost infinite

263
00:25:01,786 --> 00:25:09,568
life to sacrifice, I guess was the idea. That's
how I understood it. Also hated that. If you

264
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:15,109
make Wonder Woman immortal, why even give her
bracelets? You know? That's true. I don't get

265
00:25:15,149 --> 00:25:21,168
it, I don't get it. Now, Secret Society of Super-Villains,
led by Lex Luthor, convenes on Earth 10, where

266
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:26,872
they discuss how the multiverse Earths can't
survive the bleed. It's revealed that Psycho-Pirate

267
00:25:26,932 --> 00:25:32,855
is Lex's prisoner, and Lex forces Psycho-Pirate
to reach out to the Anti-Monitor. Meanwhile,

268
00:25:33,095 --> 00:25:39,699
on the same Earth, Batman and his allies battle
an army of time-displaced Nazi soldiers armed

269
00:25:39,719 --> 00:25:45,991
with weapons from Gotham's villains. When Batman
is gassed with fear toxin, He remembers encountering

270
00:25:46,051 --> 00:25:53,177
an elderly Barry Allen during his time on Warworld.
Now of course Earth-10 in the comics is actually

271
00:25:53,297 --> 00:25:59,743
Earth-X. It's like the Roman numeral 10 where
Nazis never lost the war. It's the Earth where

272
00:25:59,823 --> 00:26:05,368
the quality comics characters like Uncle Sam
and Black Condor live. One thing I really didn't

273
00:26:05,408 --> 00:26:11,119
get in this film is how Psycho Pirate became
so freaking weak. Like how would he become

274
00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:16,500
Lex Luthor's prisoner when he could totally
just take control of Lex Luthor and all of

275
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,662
the other villains? Well, he was being tortured
at the start of this movie, so you have to

276
00:26:20,702 --> 00:26:27,544
assume that somehow he was captured and tortured
immediately, I guess? Okay, maybe, but also

277
00:26:27,784 --> 00:26:33,125
he's the freaking Psycho Pirate. Like he was
totally amped up with power in the second film.

278
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:38,552
and could have easily just projected his emotions
to take control of the situation, whether he's

279
00:26:38,572 --> 00:26:43,675
being tortured or not. Like if he's feeling
pain and like distress from being tortured,

280
00:26:43,915 --> 00:26:49,318
he could project that distress onto the people
torturing him. That's valid. So that was dumb.

281
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:55,522
Moving on back on the mothership, as Supergirl
expresses remorse for killing the monitor,

282
00:26:55,842 --> 00:27:00,824
Lex Luthor arrives just as the Anti-Monitor
finds and destroys Aquaman's underwater world

283
00:27:01,165 --> 00:27:08,299
of Earth-146. by projecting an antimatter wave.
After Batman confides with Dr. Midnight about

284
00:27:08,339 --> 00:27:14,381
his vision of the Flash, Dr. Fate confirms that
Batman's vision was real and that to solve

285
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:20,082
their ongoing crisis they would need to look
back to before the creation of the multiverse.

286
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:25,864
When Jon Stewart remembers that John Constantine
mentioned that he'd been around since before

287
00:27:25,904 --> 00:27:32,178
the universe began, they manage to find him
drunk in a saloon on Earth 18. and suffering

288
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:39,461
from memory loss. The scene in which Supergirl
is confessing her guilt to Batgirl, I assume

289
00:27:39,561 --> 00:27:44,603
is around the time that Supergirl revealed the
existence of the dream machine to Barbara Gordon,

290
00:27:44,983 --> 00:27:50,305
and I'm wondering why she didn't ever think
to use the dream machine to stop the Anti-Monitor

291
00:27:50,345 --> 00:27:55,987
to begin with. That's a great question, and
that's a major plot hole. She knew the location,

292
00:27:56,408 --> 00:28:01,470
so she could have easily told everyone where
to find it and how they could use it. It's

293
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:07,451
really weird that she didn't do that. But, you
know, regardless, at the very minimum, they

294
00:28:07,471 --> 00:28:12,353
should have had the scene where she told Batgirl
about it. Yeah. Maybe they didn't have that

295
00:28:12,373 --> 00:28:16,134
because then they realized that if that had
been the case, she could have used the Miracle

296
00:28:16,174 --> 00:28:21,375
Machine to save everyone from the very start.
Plot hole. Now after the Anti-Monitor finds

297
00:28:21,415 --> 00:28:27,457
and destroys Earth-2, the heroes on Monitor's
ship deduce that the Anti-Monitor is able to

298
00:28:27,517 --> 00:28:33,443
find their worlds in the Bleed. because someone
there is in contact with him. While Lex Luthor

299
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:39,266
confesses to sacrificing worlds to gain more
information on the anti-monitor, back on Earth

300
00:28:39,346 --> 00:28:46,309
18, Batman, Dr. Fate, and Constantine perform
a seance to access Constantine's past memories,

301
00:28:46,649 --> 00:28:51,571
where they view the concluding events of the
film Justice League Dark Apocalypse War and

302
00:28:51,651 --> 00:28:56,693
learn that Constantine encouraged the Flash
to go back in time to kill Darkseid as a baby,

303
00:28:57,174 --> 00:29:02,837
so that he could never destroy their universe.
Unknown to the Flash, Constantine sacrificed

304
00:29:02,877 --> 00:29:08,800
a part of his soul to place a spell on Flash
so that any being he encountered would die,

305
00:29:09,141 --> 00:29:14,124
knowing that the Flash wouldn't be able to bring
himself to actually kill a baby. As one of

306
00:29:14,164 --> 00:29:20,687
the immutable pillars of existence, Darkseid's
death shattered reality, creating a multiverse

307
00:29:20,807 --> 00:29:25,822
of infinite Earths. First of all, how cute was
baby Darkseid? I just wanted to grab him and

308
00:29:25,842 --> 00:29:29,705
squeeze him and just be like, aw, little baby
Darkseid. I don't think I could have come to

309
00:29:29,745 --> 00:29:34,088
kill him either. He was just too adorable. Second
of all, how do you feel about Darkseid being

310
00:29:34,128 --> 00:29:39,552
like a pillar of the universe what the MCU would
call an absolute point or a nexus being or

311
00:29:39,572 --> 00:29:43,435
something like that? I think it makes total
sense. I actually really liked that explanation.

312
00:29:43,635 --> 00:29:47,878
They also refer to him as like a fixed point
in time. So yeah, it reminded me a lot of like

313
00:29:47,898 --> 00:29:53,502
a nexus being for a Marvel. Does that mean though
that the DC universe is- always destined to

314
00:29:53,522 --> 00:30:00,306
be destroyed by Darkseid obtaining the anti-life
equation. I think so. I think so. I think that's

315
00:30:00,326 --> 00:30:05,029
what the final crisis was all about in the comics
because that's what happens. Darkseid is essentially

316
00:30:05,129 --> 00:30:11,112
DC's devil, and there's only one of him in the
entire multiverse in the comics when the multiverse

317
00:30:11,132 --> 00:30:15,775
was reestablished. So yeah, I actually really
liked that. My understanding of the situation

318
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:20,677
is that because Constantine and the Flash created
a universe in which there was no Darkseid,

319
00:30:21,134 --> 00:30:26,775
universe kind of shattered and started cascading
in a series of events and choices that would

320
00:30:26,835 --> 00:30:31,356
split off alternate dimensions and whatnot.
Yeah, an infinite number of dimensions. It

321
00:30:31,376 --> 00:30:36,278
was unsustainable essentially is how they explained
it. Now when the heroes witness anti-monitor

322
00:30:36,318 --> 00:30:42,699
destroy Earth A.D. which is Commandy's Earth,
Lex deduces that the energy of the merged suns

323
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:48,381
should be powerful enough to destroy the anti-monitor
though Superman would likely die absorbing

324
00:30:48,501 --> 00:30:55,184
and delivering the Guilt-stricken, Kara takes
Superman's place, flying into the sun to absorb

325
00:30:55,344 --> 00:31:00,926
its energy. When the Anti-Monitor appears in
the Bleed once again, the heroes of the Multiverse

326
00:31:00,946 --> 00:31:07,089
attack it in an effort to buy Kara time to absorb
enough energy. When Martian Manhunter takes

327
00:31:07,229 --> 00:31:12,031
over Lex Luthor's mind, using him to encourage
Superman to disable the Earth's towers and

328
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:16,032
pull the planets out of the Bleed, the heroes
comply, allowing

329
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:26,054
and deliver a blow to Anti-Monitor strong enough
to crack his armor. Meanwhile, on Earth 18,

330
00:31:26,454 --> 00:31:31,957
new members from the Green Lantern Corps find
Jon Stewart and deliver him a Green Lantern

331
00:31:32,077 --> 00:31:38,141
Ring. And now we finally know why the Warworld
movie even existed, because I think we speculated

332
00:31:38,181 --> 00:31:43,764
in previous reviews that the Warworld movie
had no purpose in the larger Tomorrowverse

333
00:31:43,824 --> 00:31:49,019
narrative, and we were wrong. this was its purpose,
to be used as a weapon against the Anti-Monitor.

334
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:54,843
Right, exactly. Part of me still doesn't care.
Part of me doesn't think that needed to be

335
00:31:55,003 --> 00:32:01,087
a film. But I mean, it is honestly cool to see
Warworld in action. When Anti-Monitor attacks

336
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:06,971
Warworld, Jon Stewart and his core members manage
to shield it from the Anti-Monitor wave. To

337
00:32:07,011 --> 00:32:12,786
fuel Warworld with enough emotional energy to
attack Anti-Monitor again. Martian Manhunter

338
00:32:12,826 --> 00:32:18,651
takes control of the mind of Electrocutioner
on Earth-10 to persuade Psycho Pirate to use

339
00:32:18,691 --> 00:32:25,437
his power to unify the emotions of every Earth
in the Multiverse. With Warworld able to breach

340
00:32:25,477 --> 00:32:32,583
the Anti-Monitor's armor once again, a solar-energized
Supergirl flies into Anti-Monitor and sacrifices

341
00:32:32,623 --> 00:32:37,928
herself to destroy him. Superman brings her
body to Warworld, where the heroes and villains

342
00:32:38,028 --> 00:32:43,023
of the Multiverse have grouped. Now, one thing
that I thought was bullshit was the fact that

343
00:32:43,083 --> 00:32:48,946
the Green Lanterns were able to stop an anti-monitor
wave. Because everything that the heroes have

344
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:54,708
been throwing at it prior to this proved ineffective.
So why now all of a sudden? Yeah, the Green

345
00:32:54,728 --> 00:32:58,030
Lanterns were like, this isn't going to work.
And just it was like, you just have to have

346
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:01,811
the willpower or something like that. I'm like,
that's such crap. Because then you could just

347
00:33:01,831 --> 00:33:05,413
have the Green Lanterns going and protecting
every Earth. They could have been doing that

348
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:11,387
this whole time. The movie does make you think
that Psycho Pirate would find newfound motivation

349
00:33:11,547 --> 00:33:17,408
in trying to take over Warworld because the
Psycho Pirate controlled Warworld would be

350
00:33:17,609 --> 00:33:23,030
almost unstoppable, you would think. Oh, absolutely.
Yeah, that'd be wild. I am really curious as

351
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:28,251
to what emotion he had everyone in the multiverse
feel, all of the different Earths, because

352
00:33:28,272 --> 00:33:33,893
they never say. They all got super horny. That's
it. That's probably it. I can see that. Yeah.

353
00:33:33,933 --> 00:33:41,149
Stupid. When Batman and Doctor Fate explained
the reason for the multiverses broken and expanding

354
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:47,674
nature, it's deduced that the Anti-Monitor was
the multiverses natural defense to stop its

355
00:33:47,774 --> 00:33:54,378
limitless and chaotic expansion. As hundreds
more Anti-Monitors suddenly emerge, Batgirl

356
00:33:54,438 --> 00:34:00,022
reveals that Supergirl once told her of a miracle
machine that existed in a pocket dimension

357
00:34:00,423 --> 00:34:06,623
between realities. Using Nightshade's teleportation
powers, the heroes are able to transfer the

358
00:34:06,663 --> 00:34:14,447
miracle machine to Warworld. As Earth's 508
and 12 fall to the Anti-Monitors, the heroes

359
00:34:14,467 --> 00:34:20,190
come to the conclusion that to save the multiverse,
they need to merge it into one prime universe

360
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:26,754
with its own history. How did Marshall Manhunter
know where to find the Dream Machine? So my

361
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:34,991
guess is that since Warworld exists between
universes, he was able to expertly navigate

362
00:34:35,011 --> 00:34:39,015
them because that's what he had been doing this
whole time. You know, he was in the bleed with

363
00:34:39,055 --> 00:34:44,580
everyone else. He had always been on Warworld,
just in between everything. How he was able

364
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:49,844
to get Nightshade to teleport the miracle machine
onto Warworld, even though she was like, I

365
00:34:49,864 --> 00:34:54,588
can't do it, was weird, because he was just
like, oh, yeah, you can. And it was just there.

366
00:34:55,309 --> 00:35:01,542
Good explanation. Exactly. I wonder why if Marshall
Manhunter had control of. Warworld this entire

367
00:35:01,602 --> 00:35:07,105
time if he didn't kind of corral the surviving
heroes and use it as a base since apparently

368
00:35:07,465 --> 00:35:11,908
It was able to navigate the multiverse in that
way. It became a base at the end But I feel

369
00:35:11,948 --> 00:35:15,910
like that could have happened sooner Yeah, he
really should have been around in the first

370
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:21,233
two movies, but they did that whole trick with
like Oh, he was there when Warworld exploded.

371
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:27,656
Wait. No, he wasn't It was cheap. In the final
moments of the film Wonder Woman sacrifices

372
00:35:27,696 --> 00:35:33,172
her immortal self to power the miracle machine
to create a new universe, which a majority

373
00:35:33,212 --> 00:35:38,536
of the heroes and villains step into, saying
goodbye to one another before merging into

374
00:35:38,576 --> 00:35:44,501
the new universe. As the rest of the multiverse
and war world are destroyed, the Spectre and

375
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:50,326
Constantine move into the afterlife. In the
new single Prime Universe, a young Wonder Woman

376
00:35:50,366 --> 00:35:56,071
plays on the island paradise of Themyscira.
Which makes me wonder how she got there, because

377
00:35:56,111 --> 00:36:00,430
she wasn't one of the few that walked into the
new universe. I assume the new universe is

378
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:05,855
populated by people whether they sacrifice themselves
or not. I mean, people who did sacrifice themselves

379
00:36:06,175 --> 00:36:12,801
were just a part of a larger whole, I guess,
as it were. But the line regarding Wonder Woman's

380
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:18,446
immortality not being a thing anymore kind of
threw me off because I guess they're saying

381
00:36:18,466 --> 00:36:23,149
she's not immortal now? Yeah, her mother Queen
Hippolyta implied that. She was like, princesses

382
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:29,523
aren't immortal. I was like, what? Now she's
not? Okay? I didn't quite look hard enough

383
00:36:29,543 --> 00:36:34,987
to determine if the art style of the new DC
Prime animated universe was very different

384
00:36:35,007 --> 00:36:39,832
from the Tomorrowverse. Like, was that final
scene done in the same style that the upcoming

385
00:36:39,872 --> 00:36:44,396
Creature Commandos is going to be in? And if
so, is this our first look at James Gunn's

386
00:36:44,476 --> 00:36:50,761
new DCU? It's hard to tell. Because the character
designs in the Tomorrowverse weren't like that

387
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:56,806
same kind of blocky Tim-verse style, you know,
they were all pretty unique. I can't tell if

388
00:36:56,907 --> 00:37:02,512
this is a new style of animation or if it's
more of the same. It looks like it's more of

389
00:37:02,572 --> 00:37:07,656
the same to me personally. But who's to say
that that's not the style that we'll be seeing

390
00:37:07,676 --> 00:37:12,220
with Creature Commandos? It could be. I guess
we'll find out later this year. If this in

391
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:18,326
fact is that same style, I wonder if this implies
that this is our first look at Wonder Woman

392
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:24,379
in James Gunn's DCU. And maybe our first look
at- Themyscira that's gonna be in the Paradise

393
00:37:24,439 --> 00:37:29,844
Lost HBO series. And maybe our first look at
the Wonder Woman costume that she'll be wearing

394
00:37:30,124 --> 00:37:35,128
with like the pants, which I would hate. Lot
of speculation, lot of unanswered questions,

395
00:37:35,648 --> 00:37:44,095
which I don't love. Like at the end of a cinematic
universe, as it were, I would love for everything

396
00:37:44,135 --> 00:37:51,241
to be wrapped up in a nice bow. That's not the
case here. And I can't express how disappointed

397
00:37:51,421 --> 00:37:57,685
I am. by the whole Tomorrowverse project. Now,
with this film specifically, though it's ambitious

398
00:37:57,725 --> 00:38:04,190
and heartfelt, it's convoluted and it's a dull
conclusion to the Tomorrowverse that proves

399
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:10,794
inaccessible to all but DC's most diehard animation
fans. I really hope you guys are out there

400
00:38:11,275 --> 00:38:15,237
and I really hope you were able to get some
enjoyment out of this if you were, because

401
00:38:15,638 --> 00:38:22,946
no one else did. And I say that as a diehard
animation fan from DC. Now we gave Crisis Part

402
00:38:23,186 --> 00:38:31,228
1 3.5 stars, we gave Crisis Part 2 3 stars.
I think this film, Part 3, is one step below

403
00:38:31,248 --> 00:38:39,831
that. So I'm giving it 2.5 stars, a rotten rating
on Rotten Tomatoes. I don't recommend it, and

404
00:38:40,011 --> 00:38:47,353
overall I can't really say I recommend the Tomorrowverse
as a whole, unfortunately. I would recommend

405
00:38:47,553 --> 00:38:53,496
if you're interested in getting into DC animation.
to either re-watch or watch for the first time

406
00:38:53,977 --> 00:38:58,301
the DC animated movie universe, which began
with Justice League the Flashpoint Paradox

407
00:38:58,741 --> 00:39:03,425
and ended with Apocalypse War. And just end
there. Like, don't continue on after that.

408
00:39:03,445 --> 00:39:08,971
It's not worth it. Except for maybe Batman and
Long Halloween. That was good. Yeah. But if

409
00:39:09,031 --> 00:39:13,455
anything, the brief glimpse that we got in this
film of Justice League Dark Apocalypse War,

410
00:39:13,635 --> 00:39:18,454
you know, like seeing those characters and that
art style. and all that, just maybe remember

411
00:39:18,474 --> 00:39:23,556
how much we connected with those characters
emotionally. So much more than we did with

412
00:39:23,656 --> 00:39:29,639
these hollow shells that were in the Tomorrowverse.
And it also reminded me of just how great Apocalypse

413
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:34,161
War was. It definitely makes me want to rewatch
it again. It makes me want to watch all of

414
00:39:34,181 --> 00:39:38,962
the films in the DC animated movie universe
because actually there's a few that I haven't

415
00:39:39,002 --> 00:39:43,944
seen. And it was just a really well put together
cinematic universe, one that rivaled, in my

416
00:39:43,984 --> 00:39:49,734
opinion, the MCU's Infinity Saga. Absolutely,
but you're not going to get a chance to re-watch

417
00:39:49,774 --> 00:39:55,256
the DC AMU films because you have a whole lot
of other animated television shows to watch

418
00:39:55,296 --> 00:40:02,098
this summer including My Adventures with Superman
season 2, Suicide Squad Isekai season 1, Batman

419
00:40:02,218 --> 00:40:09,840
Caped Crusader season 1, Kite Man season 1,
and Watchmen chapter 1. So you have all of

420
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:15,081
your free time accounted for basically. If you
guys don't hear from me, it's because I'm watching

421
00:40:15,101 --> 00:40:21,225
TV. That is my life now. I have to start watching
Hit Monkey too, but I'm really looking forward

422
00:40:21,245 --> 00:40:25,830
to that. I'm looking forward to all of it. Though
I will say, we will be dropping some of our

423
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:31,415
reviews a little late, I think, just so that
all of my life is not just television. I do

424
00:40:31,435 --> 00:40:37,801
have a job, I do have a family. So if things
are coming late, just expect that. Yeah, just

425
00:40:37,821 --> 00:40:42,005
know that they are coming. But I think that
does it for this review. AJ9K helped close

00:41:11,317 --> 00:41:16,736
Console Combat. Our next episode is going to
be another review, but it's going to be an

432
00:41:16,876 --> 00:41:23,161
awesome review because it's going to be of Deadpool
and Wolverine. Another culmination of a trilogy

433
00:41:23,201 --> 00:41:28,265
that is infinitely more awesome than Crisis
on Infinite Earths. I'm expecting a lot from

434
00:41:28,305 --> 00:41:31,808
Deadpool and Wolverine and I hope it meets my
expectations. I have to try to manage them

435
00:41:31,928 --> 00:41:37,753
because I am just off the walls with anticipation.
This is the only MCU film that you're getting

436
00:41:37,793 --> 00:41:42,563
this year, right? Correct. There's still a couple
more Sony Marvel movies coming out this year,

437
00:41:42,603 --> 00:41:47,825
including Venom and Craven the Hunter. But Deadpool
and Wolverine is the only MCU film. Yeah. We're

438
00:41:47,845 --> 00:41:52,827
not getting another Marvel Studios film until
Valentine's Day with Captain America Brave

439
00:41:52,847 --> 00:41:58,209
New World. I was going to say sucks to suck,
but I only have Joker 2 coming out this year.

440
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:02,771
But that's going to be phenomenal, like way
better than Deadpool and Wolverine. Manage

441
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:07,493
your expectations. We all know Joker Part 2
is going to suck. OK. It's a musical. All right.

442
00:42:07,513 --> 00:42:11,458
I don't know that. You can't say that, I don't
know that. But that does it for this episode

443
00:42:11,498 --> 00:42:16,080
