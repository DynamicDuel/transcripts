00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:29,532
Hi, Merry Christmas, everybody. Welcome to the
Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

3
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:35,416
review superhero films and debate the superiority
between Marvel and DC by comparing their characters

4
00:00:35,476 --> 00:00:41,139
in stat-based battle simulations. I'm Johnny
DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous Joe.

5
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:46,502
Happy holidays. And in this Christmas charity
duel episode, we are going to find out who

6
00:00:46,562 --> 00:00:53,158
is going to win between Batman's dog, Ace the
Bat Hound, and Deadpool's dog, or just... another

7
00:00:53,258 --> 00:00:58,939
version of Deadpool, but it's dogpool. You could
definitely call him Deadpool's dog. He definitely

8
00:00:58,959 --> 00:01:04,061
belongs to the Deadpool core. But yeah, we call
this a charity duel because we are bringing

9
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:08,422
attention to a charity that we donate to every
year. This year it's going to be Stand Up to

10
00:01:08,442 --> 00:01:13,843
Cancer Guys. And the way you could help us donate
is by making a purchase at our shop at dynamicduel.com

11
00:01:14,123 --> 00:01:18,484
and clicking the store link at the top of the

12
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:22,826

Stand Up to Cancer. So if you can, Please support

13
00:01:22,846 --> 00:01:27,670
our show and support a great cause. Yeah, usually
this time of year when we do our charity episode,

14
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:33,295
we typically pit animals against each other.
Last year, of course, we did Alfred versus

15
00:01:33,315 --> 00:01:38,780
Jarvis, but in previous charity duels, we've
pit characters like Rocket Raccoon and the

16
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,844
Green Lantern Chip against each other, as well
as Crypto and Throg. Yeah, we did Howard the

17
00:01:43,884 --> 00:01:50,582
Duck versus Detective Chimp. I know we did Hit
Monkey versus Gleek the Wonder Monkey. Yeah,

18
00:01:50,622 --> 00:01:55,647
we did What's It versus Spider-Ham. That was
a fun one. What else have we done? We've literally

19
00:01:55,687 --> 00:02:01,953
done one each year that this podcast has been
around since 2016. There's a lot of them, definitely

20
00:02:01,993 --> 00:02:05,416
check them out. Yeah, before we get into that
duel, we're gonna break down the latest comic

21
00:02:05,436 --> 00:02:10,742
book movie news to come out this past week,
including the motherfucking Superman official

22
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:16,312
teaser trailer. It's dope! We're gonna talk
about how dope it is. Later on, as always,

00:04:22,985 --> 00:04:29,468
But with that out of the way, quick to the no
prize. A no prize is an award Marvel used to

47
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:34,523
give out to fans. Our version, the dynamic duel
no prize. is a digital award we post on Instagram

48
00:04:34,543 --> 00:04:39,327
for the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week we asked,

49
00:04:39,848 --> 00:04:45,412
if Avengers Doomsday is featuring an evil version
of the Earth's Mightiest Heroes, what evil

50
00:04:45,432 --> 00:04:49,716
version of a character do you most hope to see
and why? And this is coming off the news that

51
00:04:50,176 --> 00:04:56,101
Chris Evans is confirmed to be joining the cast
of Avengers Doomsday alongside Robert Downey

52
00:04:56,121 --> 00:05:01,505
Jr. as Dr. Doom, as we've discussed before.
So the prevailing theory among fans is that

53
00:05:01,986 --> 00:05:07,807
They're gonna go a Dark Avengers route where
we see like Robert Downey Jr. as Dr. Doom and

54
00:05:07,847 --> 00:05:13,549
Chris Evans as an evil version of Captain America.
We got three answers. So let's go ahead and

55
00:05:13,589 --> 00:05:17,710
run down our two honorable mentions as well
as the no-prize winner. Our first honorable

56
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:23,692
mention goes to Kyle who said, Hi guys, the
evil version of a character that I most want

57
00:05:23,712 --> 00:05:29,093
to see in Avengers Dimpsay probably has to be
Captain Hydra. Because I think it is a really

58
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:34,973
interesting idea. to have Captain America being
controlled by Hydra and going against everything

59
00:05:34,993 --> 00:05:39,277
that we think the character stands for. So I
think that'd be pretty cool. Thanks, Kyle.

60
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:43,341
Yeah, I think the prevailing theory for the
evil version of Captain America would be Hydra

61
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:49,106
Cap, the most prominent and recent example of
an evil version of Captain America. Yeah, I

62
00:05:49,126 --> 00:05:53,991
remember when that comic came out and everybody
hated it. To be fair, it was pretty jarring.

63
00:05:54,051 --> 00:05:58,714
It was a jarring story. Do you think Chris Evans
could pull off and- Evil Captain America, Hydra

64
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:03,358
Cap? I think an actor like him is up for the
challenge, absolutely. Yeah, it would definitely

65
00:06:03,378 --> 00:06:08,121
be a different take on a character that he's
nearly exhausted on screen. And that may be

66
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:12,564
what attracted him to the role in the first
place. We'll see. But great answer, Kyle. Our

67
00:06:12,584 --> 00:06:17,908
next honorable mention goes to Brandon Eschergard,
who said, If they are going to do an evil version

68
00:06:17,928 --> 00:06:22,971
of the Avengers in the next movie, I definitely
want to see an evil version of Scott Lang.

69
00:06:23,912 --> 00:06:28,586
I think it would be kind of interesting seeing,
like, one of the most positive characters in

70
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:34,108
the universe. Basically, be complete opposite
and flipped. And, yeah. Yeah, I don't recall

71
00:06:34,128 --> 00:06:38,769
there being an evil version of Scott Link from
the comics, but there was an evil Ant-Man named

72
00:06:38,929 --> 00:06:46,031
Eric O'Grady, who was an Irish shield agent
who stole one of Hank Pym's Ant-Man suits and

73
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:51,132
then used it to like stalk women and stuff like
that. He was a fucking asshole. And I think

74
00:06:51,152 --> 00:06:55,774
it would actually be kind of funny to see Paul
Rudd pull off that type of role. Actually,

75
00:06:55,814 --> 00:07:00,356
I think I'd be more interested in seeing an
evil version of Hank Pym. Maybe like fused

76
00:07:00,396 --> 00:07:05,619
with Ultron? That'd be wild. Well, that would
be Michael Douglas in the role. Right, exactly.

77
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,981
I know, I'd rather see an evil Paul Rudd just
because I think there's a whimsy to that. Like

78
00:07:10,001 --> 00:07:13,503
a kind of lightheartedness. I don't need them
necessarily to go as dark with the character

79
00:07:13,523 --> 00:07:17,345
of Ant-Man because Ant-Man is so beloved, you
know? I think it would be weird considering

80
00:07:17,385 --> 00:07:22,688
the tone of the Ant-Man franchise to go fully
evil. I think it'd be better to see Paul Rudd

81
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:29,135
as like an Irish hooligan kind of thing. That
sounds awful. Do not like that take. Great

82
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:33,157
answer, Brandon. We want to give a quick shout
out to Alex, who called to tell us about the

83
00:07:33,237 --> 00:07:37,278
data that he's been compiling about all of our
duels. Thank you very much for reaching out.

84
00:07:37,679 --> 00:07:43,061
But the winner of this week's Snow Prize goes
to Mike Williams, who said. Hi guys, Mike Williams

85
00:07:43,141 --> 00:07:49,864
here. Instead of going in the direction of darkest
version of the Avengers, I'd like to see them

86
00:07:50,444 --> 00:07:57,223
introduce the Squadron Supreme or maybe even
Norman Osborn. Dark Avengers give them some

87
00:07:57,763 --> 00:08:04,367
good antagonists to fight against instead of
turning Regular Avengers into the dark versions.

88
00:08:04,747 --> 00:08:08,710
Anyway, that's my opinion. I think that's a
great opinion I didn't even think about that

89
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:13,552
a lot of the prevailing ideas out there are
about the Dark Avengers considering Chris Evans

90
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:18,035
return But what if he's not playing a dark version
of Captain America? What if he's playing a

91
00:08:18,095 --> 00:08:23,774
dark version of Superman himself Hyperion the
Marvel Comics character? I would be really

92
00:08:23,814 --> 00:08:27,676
surprised if they're going that route considering
the fact that they're gonna have the sentry

93
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:33,159
in the upcoming Thunderbolts movie Who's already
kind of like a dark-ish version of Superman

94
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:37,782
plus we had Icarus and Eternals who was like
an evil Superman I don't know if they would

95
00:08:37,882 --> 00:08:43,065
retread that water although it is intriguing
to me that Chris Evans would not be playing

96
00:08:43,465 --> 00:08:48,128
a Version of Captain America. They could go
that route. He could literally be anyone considering

97
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:54,291
that it's not like RDJ is playing Tony Stark
That's true. That's very villain. At the end

98
00:08:54,311 --> 00:08:58,955
of the day, we have no idea where they're going
with the plot for Avengers Doomsday, but I'm

99
00:08:58,995 --> 00:09:03,559
highly anticipating the reveal of who Chris
Evans will be playing. If they do bring in

100
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:08,844
Squadron Supreme, not going to lie, at this
point, I would not hate it if they brought

101
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:16,090
in Zack Snyder's Justice League cast. Henry
Cavill as Hyperion. And Ben Affleck as Nighthawk

102
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:22,162
and Gal Gadot as Power Princess. That would
be awesome. Even get Ezra Miller in there.

103
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:27,586
It would be the Marvel and DC movie that we'll
never get. Exactly, exactly. So congrats to

104
00:09:27,606 --> 00:09:30,908
Mike Williams for winning this week's No Prize.
If you the listener want a shot at winning

105
00:09:30,928 --> 00:09:34,931
your own No Prize, stay tuned to later on this
episode when we'll be asking another Question

106
00:09:34,951 --> 00:09:38,173
of the Week. And now that that's done, on to
the news.

107
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:50,892
Okay, so this past week, Warner Brothers unveiled
the first official teaser trailer for the first

108
00:09:50,952 --> 00:10:01,254
official movie within the new DC Universe, Superman.
Now, there has probably not been a trailer

109
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:07,456
that I have been more looking forward to and
most apprehensive about in the eight years

110
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:13,214
that we've been doing this podcast. Because
it was going to set the tone. for a film that

111
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:20,217
was likely going to set the tone for the rest
of DC's films going forward. I really did not

112
00:10:20,257 --> 00:10:25,699
have too many expectations for this trailer.
There was nothing really specific that I wanted

113
00:10:25,739 --> 00:10:31,461
to see except for maybe Superman flying, but
I was hoping that it was going to capture a

114
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:38,064
specific tone that I think a lot of people complained
that the Snyder films did not have, and that

115
00:10:38,144 --> 00:10:44,771
was one of hope. So in that regard, when I finished
watching this trailer for the first time, I

116
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:51,755
was unbelievably happy. And I still am. I love
this trailer. I love the precedent that it's

117
00:10:51,815 --> 00:10:57,878
setting for James Gunn's universe as a whole.
I always knew he was a really talented filmmaker,

118
00:10:58,018 --> 00:11:04,122
particularly when it comes to story and heartfelt
stories at that, considering what he did in

119
00:11:04,142 --> 00:11:09,105
the Marvel universe with the Guardians of the
Galaxy films, it looks to me initially that

120
00:11:09,245 --> 00:11:13,879
he really gets the character. And I think he's
going to give us a version of the character

121
00:11:14,179 --> 00:11:19,581
that we haven't seen in a really long time.
So in what way does this new teaser trailer

122
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:25,684
evoke the theme of hope to you that the previous
franchise did not? Well, I didn't know that

123
00:11:25,704 --> 00:11:31,486
the previous franchises were not necessarily
going to inspire hope, as it were. I think

124
00:11:31,646 --> 00:11:37,109
the first two acts of Man of Steel were really
good. I know Zack Snyder lost a lot of people

125
00:11:37,429 --> 00:11:41,454
with the whole neck snap thing. I'd be really
surprised if they did anything like that in

126
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:46,136
this film. Especially considering that James
Gunn and Peter Safran, the heads of DC, have

127
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:52,399
been talking about how nice of a guy this Superman
is. But, you know, even more than that, it

128
00:11:52,719 --> 00:11:58,222
definitely looks like we're getting a Superman
that is different from previous versions in

129
00:11:58,282 --> 00:12:04,904
that, hey, the guy can bleed. He's not this
unrelatable figure that's invulnerable and

130
00:12:04,944 --> 00:12:09,643
everything comes so easy to him because he's
so powerful. From the opening shot of this

131
00:12:09,683 --> 00:12:15,389
trailer, we see him broken and bleeding. And
this isn't something we ever saw from Henry

132
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:19,833
Cavill's Superman, really, even when he was
being killed by Doomsday or being beaten up

133
00:12:19,873 --> 00:12:25,799
by Batman. Just hearing him breathing in this
opening scene was pretty powerful, I thought.

134
00:12:26,219 --> 00:12:31,865
And to have that juxtaposed with the shots of
him as Clark Kent, whether it's in Metropolis

135
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:37,307
at the Daily Planet. or on the Smallville farm
with his father. It just gave this very human

136
00:12:37,347 --> 00:12:42,469
feeling to him. And he's definitely approaching
Clark Kent differently from his Superman, which

137
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:47,151
is something that Henry Cavill never did. And
I know that was another big criticism of his

138
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:53,594
performance. If we're comparing Corn Sweat to
Cavill, I will say that my big impression from

139
00:12:53,634 --> 00:12:58,076
this teaser was that Corn Sweat doesn't have
nearly the presence that Cavill does. And I

140
00:12:58,116 --> 00:13:02,678
think general audiences are gonna take note.
Define presence. Well, Corn Sweat, definitely

141
00:13:02,718 --> 00:13:07,961
seems much more human. Like I think you were
talking about how he seems much more vulnerable.

142
00:13:08,241 --> 00:13:13,965
That's definitely the case. He seems less iconic
than the icon that is Superman. And so therefore

143
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:19,128
it kind of feels like he seems like a lesser
Superman, you could say, than Cavill's very,

144
00:13:19,228 --> 00:13:23,871
you know, strong striking image that you see
when you see Cavill in the suit. Yeah, I mean,

145
00:13:24,632 --> 00:13:29,578
I would agree with that. I don't think that's
necessarily a bad thing. I think Zack Snyder's

146
00:13:29,778 --> 00:13:36,221
and Henry Cavill's Superman was very much this
like supermodel bodybuilder type Superman,

147
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:44,024
whereas David Cornsweat is not that. Although
apparently he's taller and heavier than Henry

148
00:13:44,044 --> 00:13:48,786
Cavill was when he played Superman, which is
wild to me. Yeah, the dude's suit is doing

149
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:53,868
him no favors though. I'll say that. It looks
like pajamas. What's interesting was that James

150
00:13:53,908 --> 00:14:00,727
Gunn revealed recently that his take on the
suit was heavily inspired by comments made

151
00:14:00,787 --> 00:14:07,810
by David Corrin Sweat about wanting to appeal
to younger, not even audiences, but just in-world

152
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:12,692
younger smaller children because he didn't want
to scare them with all of his power and strength.

153
00:14:12,812 --> 00:14:17,494
He wanted to look like a classic wrestler of
sorts, even you know having the trunks on the

154
00:14:17,594 --> 00:14:22,736
outside. And I actually liked that approach.
I liked that they took that approach with this

155
00:14:22,797 --> 00:14:26,794
version of the suit. Seeing it in live action,
I still think it works. I thought it looked

156
00:14:26,874 --> 00:14:30,236
great in the set photos. I know there's still
some people who have a problem with it, but

157
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:34,698
I am not one of those people. I mean, it moves
well in the action shots. When you see him

158
00:14:34,758 --> 00:14:40,380
saving the girl from the explosion or you see
him punching his way out of that glass cube.

159
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,782
Yeah, it all looks great. Oh yeah, totally.
You know what? One thing we haven't really

160
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:50,705
seen in a Superman from the past was dynamic
hair. And I didn't realize until this trailer

161
00:14:51,045 --> 00:14:55,491
how much that lends to like. the speed and movement
of the character, whether he's flying through

162
00:14:55,511 --> 00:15:00,053
the sky, whether he's saving that young girl.
It's like all the other Superman have had their

163
00:15:00,093 --> 00:15:05,916
hair like hair sprayed and plastered to their
head. Just like a ton of super gel, apparently.

164
00:15:06,476 --> 00:15:10,558
Not so with David Corn sweat. Even when he was
Clark Kent, I thought it was gonna look so

165
00:15:10,578 --> 00:15:15,180
much worse than it actually did when it was
being filmed. Nah, I don't like his look as

166
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,398
Clark Kent at all. No, I thought he was perfect
as Clark Kent. Even when he was like looking

167
00:15:19,438 --> 00:15:23,422
back at like Lois and then quickly looked away.
It was a take on Clark Kent that we haven't

168
00:15:23,462 --> 00:15:29,027
seen on screen in a while. And I loved it. You
know what else I loved? The look of Crypto.

169
00:15:29,647 --> 00:15:35,252
I am so excited that Crypto is in this movie.
Of course, we saw Crypto in the League of Superpets

170
00:15:35,332 --> 00:15:40,176
animated film, but he looks so much cuter here.
I just love the little guy. I just want to

171
00:15:40,256 --> 00:15:46,201
come a hug. Yeah, in League of Superpets, he
was like a white golden lab. Something like

172
00:15:46,261 --> 00:15:50,864
that. Maybe. But here, I don't know what he
looks like. He looks like a scraggly white

173
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:55,347
mutt. Yeah, almost like a terrier type look.
Definitely not a purebred, but you know, he's

174
00:15:55,407 --> 00:16:00,371
pure white. He looks fantastic. I can't tell
you how excited I got when Superman started

175
00:16:00,431 --> 00:16:03,693
whistling, because I knew Krypto was in the
movie. I wasn't sure if we were gonna get a

176
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:08,377
shot of him in this trailer. When he was whistling,
I was like, oh shit, he's calling Krypto. And

177
00:16:08,397 --> 00:16:13,700
then just to see him running through the snow,
it was super cute. I loved it. There's a lot

178
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,154
of endearing things about Superman. in this
movie, almost like in a tricky kind of way,

179
00:16:19,254 --> 00:16:24,536
because, you know, in film, there's ways to
kind of cheat the audience so that it likes

180
00:16:24,836 --> 00:16:29,137
characters that aren't necessarily likeable.
Superman's a likeable character. But when you

181
00:16:29,257 --> 00:16:33,858
add things like, oh, he has a dog and oh, he's
saving children and stuff like that, it just

182
00:16:33,938 --> 00:16:39,100
endears them to the audience even more. They're
really trying to appeal to the audiences with

183
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,700
this teaser trailer right out the bat.

184
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:51,550
He saves children. He's the nice guy. Yeah,
and dude, oh man, my favorite part of the trailer,

185
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:58,295
the one that literally had my eyes watering,
was when the little boy in that foreign conflict

186
00:16:58,595 --> 00:17:04,139
was raising the Superman flag and calling on
Superman. Oh man, that was a great scene. I

187
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:08,842
don't know why that impacted me so much, but
it did. I loved it. The idea that this is a

188
00:17:08,963 --> 00:17:13,406
Superman that little kids would call to and
you sort of got a little bit of that. with

189
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:19,789
Zack Snyder in Mexico saving kids from a burning
building. But that felt a little bit more weird

190
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:24,792
because Zack Snyder played it up as like almost
worship. Here, this doesn't seem to be the

191
00:17:24,812 --> 00:17:30,295
case. The little kid just needs a hero. We,
of course, get to see a lot of other side characters

192
00:17:30,335 --> 00:17:36,879
besides crypto in this trailer, including Lex
Luthor, including Lois Lane, played by Nicholas

193
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:41,866
Holt and Rachel Brosnahan, respectively. And
they look like they're going to crush it. Like

194
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:48,311
literally the best versions of Lex Luthor and
Lo Slane that we've seen on screen in my opinion.

195
00:17:48,912 --> 00:17:54,016
And I really liked Kevin Spacey's look for Lex
Luthor, but his plan was stupid. I'm hoping

196
00:17:54,176 --> 00:17:59,761
that Nicholas Holtz crushes it though. He just
looks like an angry dude. His like sharp features

197
00:17:59,801 --> 00:18:04,526
as well I think lend themselves pretty good
to a character like Lex Luthor who started

198
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:09,670
off as like this mad scientist type villain.
And I guess still is. What do you think of

199
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:14,111
the other heroes in this teaser? The terrifics
like Green Lantern, Mr. Terrific, Hawk Girl,

200
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:19,232
and Metamorpho. Metamorpho was strange. I didn't
even realize that was Metamorpho until like

201
00:18:19,532 --> 00:18:23,934
the third time I watched this trailer, like
the third of a hundred times that I've watched

202
00:18:23,994 --> 00:18:30,455
this trailer. Hawk Girl looks awesome, so does
Mr. Terrific. Nathan Fillion's Guy Gardner

203
00:18:30,655 --> 00:18:36,697
looks pretty silly. I think he looks worse actually
being filmed than he did in the set photos.

204
00:18:36,777 --> 00:18:41,698
I thought he actually looked cool. in those,
but he looks really goofy here. But I guess

205
00:18:42,219 --> 00:18:47,060
Guy Gardner is supposed to. What was more interesting
to me in this trailer was that they showed

206
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,982
Superman in stag industries. I almost wonder
if the Terrifix are affiliated with stag industries

207
00:18:53,022 --> 00:18:56,262
somehow. I don't even know if they're called
the Terrifix. They might be the Justice League.

208
00:18:56,422 --> 00:19:01,004
We don't know. I do have to say I was excited
to see not only the crystalline structure of

209
00:19:01,024 --> 00:19:05,265
the Fortress of Solitude, because that's another
thing that I've been missing for a while, but

210
00:19:05,305 --> 00:19:11,915
also the number of Kaiju. that apparently attack
Metropolis in this movie. There's the giant

211
00:19:11,955 --> 00:19:17,037
dragon, there's the giant eyeball, something's
knocking over a huge building. I have this

212
00:19:17,117 --> 00:19:22,440
theory so far because we don't know anything
about the story. But my guess is actually that

213
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:28,902
maybe Lex Luthor breaks into the Fortress of
Solitude and unleashes Superman's like alien

214
00:19:28,962 --> 00:19:33,244
zoo and the monsters just attack Metropolis
and that's why people seem to hate Superman

215
00:19:33,284 --> 00:19:37,846
and are throwing cans at his head and stuff
like that. It's not a bad theory. It's probably

216
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:43,448
wrong, but I wouldn't hate that idea. The floating
laser eye does still strike me as interesting.

217
00:19:43,468 --> 00:19:48,750
This is something we saw in the very first official
image released of David Corn sweat in the Superman

218
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:54,273
suit when he's putting on his boots. He still
does not seem to be terribly concerned by the

219
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:59,375
floating eyeball in the sky, lasering buildings,
and I'm not sure why. Sometimes you just got

220
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:03,596
to make out with your girlfriend before you
can go save the day. Priorities. Got to have

221
00:20:03,616 --> 00:20:08,839
them. Like I said at the beginning of this discussion.
Overall, this trailer has me really looking

222
00:20:08,879 --> 00:20:14,522
forward to not only this next Superman film,
which I think James Gunn is going to crush,

223
00:20:14,862 --> 00:20:20,506
but also the upcoming DCU. It's weird that this
trailer is about a character who's supposed

224
00:20:20,526 --> 00:20:26,789
to inspire hope. And I feel like I have more
hope now than I've had in a really long time.

225
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:32,633
As a DC fan? Yes, because, you know, with the
whole Snyder versus DeBacle thing with the

226
00:20:32,673 --> 00:20:37,344
Justice League film. Since Joss Whedon took
that over and just with all the studio interference,

227
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:43,908
it feels like we haven't really had a good clear
direction for Superman on film, which we absolutely

228
00:20:43,928 --> 00:20:49,472
should because he's the flagship character of
DC. And I'm pretty confident that now we do.

229
00:20:49,932 --> 00:20:55,215
You know, my impression from this teaser is
that this Superman movie is going to be the

230
00:20:59,126 --> 00:21:03,468
that movie was for the Marvel Universe. I think
the comparisons that were made between Spider-Man

231
00:21:03,508 --> 00:21:08,090
Homecoming and the amazing Spider-Man franchise
will be the same ones that are made between

232
00:21:08,431 --> 00:21:12,213
this new Superman franchise and the Man of Steel
franchise. You know, there are still a lot

233
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:16,595
of fans out there of Andrew Garfield, and in
many ways, yeah, he looks and acts a lot more

234
00:21:16,635 --> 00:21:21,638
like the comic book version of Peter Parker
than Tom Holland does. But the Spider-Man Home

235
00:21:21,658 --> 00:21:26,481
franchise was exactly what the MCU needed. It's
exactly what the cinematic character of Spider-Man

236
00:21:26,521 --> 00:21:30,807
needed to be at the time. It was still a taste
of the familiar. You know, it was like the

237
00:21:30,847 --> 00:21:35,250
second time that the franchise had been rebooted
within the decade. But audiences didn't mind

238
00:21:35,270 --> 00:21:39,892
that as much because the fans were finally getting
what they wanted. Yeah, and it's like Homecoming

239
00:21:39,952 --> 00:21:45,015
wasn't an origin story in the same way that
the Superman movie is not going to be an origin

240
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:50,018
story, allegedly. Although it does look like
this may be the time when Lois Lane learns

241
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:54,741
that Clark can't is Superman, because we see
her kissing both in this trailer. So it's still

242
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:59,132
exciting. Again, I love this trailer and I'm
really curious to hear how much you guys loved

243
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:02,017
this trailer and that brings us to our question
of the week.

244
00:22:06,538 --> 00:22:11,699
On a scale of 1 to 10, how excited has this
teaser trailer made you for James Gunn's DCU

245
00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:18,521
and why? Yeah, why is it 10? Record your answer

250
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:48,500
But that does it for the news for this episode,
now let's move on to the main event where we

251
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:55,445
find out who will win in a showdown between
Batman's dog Ace the Bat Hound and Deadpool's

252
00:22:55,485 --> 00:22:56,725
dog Dogpool.

253
00:23:12,054 --> 00:23:18,318
All right, Ace the Bat Hound versus Dogpool.
Of course, we saw Dogpool earlier this year

254
00:23:18,698 --> 00:23:25,163
in the Deadpool and Wolverine film. And we saw
Ace actually last year in the Super Pets film.

255
00:23:25,463 --> 00:23:30,066
Although Ace is very different in the comics
than he was in that movie. Yeah, there've been

256
00:23:30,286 --> 00:23:34,829
a lot of different versions of Ace the Bat Hound,
which makes me think that Ace keeps dying and

257
00:23:34,849 --> 00:23:40,013
then Batman keeps getting a new dog and calling
him Ace. Cause there's been an English Mastiff

258
00:23:40,053 --> 00:23:45,357
version of Ace. a Doberman Pinscher version
of Ace, a Great Dane version of Ace, a German

259
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:51,102
Shepherd version of Ace, like a lot of fucking
Aces. Hey, man, there's four Aces in a deck.

260
00:23:51,122 --> 00:23:56,907
It's all right. Whereas Docpul, I guess his
breed has somewhat changed during the course

261
00:23:56,927 --> 00:24:01,310
of the comics too. Or maybe it hasn't changed.
He's just gotten less mangy looking because

262
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:05,734
when he first came out in the comics, the dog
looked freaking weird, man. He looked like

263
00:24:05,914 --> 00:24:10,730
a mangy brown mutt. And in the comics now, he's
a little bit more clean cut. Although in the

264
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:15,933
movie, he was a Mexican hairless dog, which
I don't know why they did that, but I guess

265
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:21,516
it made sense for the film. And that hasn't
made its way into the comics? Oh no, MCU version

266
00:24:21,556 --> 00:24:25,458
of Dogpool has definitely made his way into
the Dogpool comics, just due to the fourth

267
00:24:25,478 --> 00:24:30,541
wall breaking nature of the Dogpool comics.
And yeah, they've teamed up and fought, but

268
00:24:30,821 --> 00:24:36,024
yeah, the MCU version of Dogpool is a separate
entity than the comic book version of Dogpool.

269
00:24:36,324 --> 00:24:40,610
So if you're picturing this character in your
head, Don't picture the Mexican hairless dog,

270
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:45,513
just picture a brown mangy mutt who looks like
he's been hit by a car but wearing a Deadpool

271
00:24:45,653 --> 00:24:50,556
outfit. Here's the thing though, Jonathan, when
we speculate on how this fight would go, do

272
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:55,359
you really want to talk about how these dogs
would essentially tear each other apart like

273
00:24:55,399 --> 00:25:00,701
in an actual dog fight? Not really. Yeah, I
don't want to either. So the way we're gonna

274
00:25:00,742 --> 00:25:06,405
approach this duel is a little bit different
just for the purpose of not looking like animal

275
00:25:06,445 --> 00:25:11,275
cruelty assholes. Instead of a fight, these
dogs are going to go head to head against each

276
00:25:11,315 --> 00:25:18,239
other in a holiday dog show. And we have judges
on standby to judge both of these dogs in their

277
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:21,701
respective stat categories. And they're going
to be competing in events showing off their

278
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:25,543
skills. And I think it'll be a lot of fun. Yes,
but of course, the winner is still going to

279
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:30,605
be determined by simulations. So to explain
our methodology behind our duels, let's go

280
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:36,869
to our sentient duel simulator, Alfred Jarvis
9000. AJ9K, tell our listeners how you go about

281
00:25:36,929 --> 00:25:39,526
determining a winner. in our duel matchups.

282
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:13,212
Additional stat categories are included such
as range, damage potential, versatility and

283
00:26:13,252 --> 00:26:18,175
perception in order to create a more detailed
and accurate simulation. The results of the

284
00:26:18,275 --> 00:26:23,018
1000 simulations provide a percentage of wins
for each character. The contestant with the

285
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:27,680
higher percentage is declared the victor as
they have a higher probability to win any given

286
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:33,664
battle. In an equitable pairing, neither character
should win 100% of the matches. The comic book

287
00:26:33,704 --> 00:26:38,230
stories have shown that there's even a way for
Batman to defeat Superman. So the confidence

288
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:42,533
rate of my method falls in line with the precedents
that have been established in the source material.

289
00:26:43,013 --> 00:26:48,377
My mathematical simulations are without subjectivity
or bias. Feats are not the sole consideration,

290
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:54,561
nor are fan votes tabulated for determination
of the winner. Thanks AJ9K. Before we run the

291
00:26:54,601 --> 00:26:58,284
simulations though, we like to break down each
character's histories and abilities before

292
00:26:58,324 --> 00:27:02,867
improvising a scenario on how we imagine one
of the 1000 simulations would play out beat

293
00:27:02,907 --> 00:27:07,858
for beat. And it's my turn to go first with
the DC character. So let me tell you all about

294
00:27:08,038 --> 00:27:13,962
Ace the Bat-Hound. Now Ace began as a German
Shepherd belonging to an engraver named John

295
00:27:14,022 --> 00:27:19,985
Wilker. When Wilker was kidnapped by a gang
of counterfeiters, Ace escaped captivity and

296
00:27:20,025 --> 00:27:26,429
was found by Batman and Robin. After posting
numerous lost dog signs around town with his

297
00:27:26,469 --> 00:27:32,112
contact info, Bruce Wayne decided to fashion
a simple hooded mask to hide Ace's identity

298
00:27:32,412 --> 00:27:38,543
so that no one would connect the dog to Batman.
when he used Ace to help find Wilker. Using

299
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:43,925
Ace's keen sense of smell, Batman and Robin
tracked down the dog's owner and apprehended

300
00:27:44,025 --> 00:27:49,248
the gang. Ace earned the nickname Bat-Hound
after helping capture one of the criminals.

301
00:27:49,648 --> 00:27:54,650
You can learn more about Batman and Robin in
our Batman vs. Moon Knight and Nightwing vs.

302
00:27:54,690 --> 00:28:00,853
Daredevil duel episodes. Though initially returned
to Wilker, Ace's owner later took a job that

303
00:28:00,893 --> 00:28:06,979
made caring for the dog impossible. leaving
Ace in Bruce Wayne's custody. Unaware of Bruce's

304
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:12,640
secret identity, Wilker assumed Ace had simply
found a good home. Ace became a loyal ally

305
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:17,422
to Batman and Robin, assisting them on cases
and even being equipped with a radio caller

306
00:28:17,442 --> 00:28:23,343
for tracking. While initially trained for crime
fighting, Ace also provided Bruce Wayne companionship

307
00:28:23,683 --> 00:28:29,125
during difficult times. However, Ace eventually
faded from active use as Batman focused on

308
00:28:29,245 --> 00:28:35,747
other methods to combat crime. Ace re-emerged
years later as a large mastiff, adopted by

309
00:28:35,807 --> 00:28:40,968
Bruce Wayne after the dog's original owner,
a blind Native American man named Black Wolf,

310
00:28:41,048 --> 00:28:47,390
passed away. This Ace was fiercely loyal, remaining
in the Batcave alongside Harold, Bruce Wayne's

311
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:54,252
mute genius mechanic. During the time when Jean-Paul
Valley, aka Asriel, temporarily replaced Bruce

312
00:28:54,392 --> 00:28:59,590
as Batman, Ace sensed something was amiss and
kept his distance. You can learn more about

313
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:05,531
Azrael in our Azrael vs. Blade episode. Ace
remained a quiet but consistent presence in

314
00:29:05,571 --> 00:29:10,573
Wayne Manor and the Batcave until his disappearance
during the events of No Man's Land when an

315
00:29:10,653 --> 00:29:16,854
earthquake devastated Gotham City. Years later,
another Ace was introduced, a German Shepherd

316
00:29:17,154 --> 00:29:22,156
and former guide dog rescued by Bruce Wayne
following his owner's death. The dog was never

317
00:29:22,316 --> 00:29:28,077
explicitly named Ace the Bat Hound in continuity,
but it maintained a similar role as a loyal

318
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:34,573
companion. In post-Flashpoint continuity, Bruce
bought an emotional support Great Dane named

319
00:29:34,693 --> 00:29:40,276
Titus for his son Damien, though Titus didn't
partake in adventures much as he wasn't trained

320
00:29:40,336 --> 00:29:46,940
for it. It wouldn't be until several years later
when Batman met a new, vicious ace, a German

321
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:52,963
Shepherd taken in as a puppy by the Joker after
killing its owner, a man in witness protection

322
00:29:53,003 --> 00:29:58,770
who had witnessed one of Joker's murders. Unsure
whether to keep or kill the pup? Joker pulled

323
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:04,513
out a deck of cards to gamble its life. Joker
drew the king, followed by an ace, meaning

324
00:30:04,573 --> 00:30:10,436
the dog got to live, and its name stuck with
him. Ace became one of several dogs outfitted

325
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:16,640
with playing card-themed masks and trained as
attack dogs. Ace, forced to wear the Ace of

326
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:22,943
Spades mask, became the pack leader. The Joker
later abandoned the dogs in a pit, leading

327
00:30:22,983 --> 00:30:28,302
them to turn on each other out of desperation.
Ace was the sole survivor. when Batman and

328
00:30:28,322 --> 00:30:34,125
Commissioner Gordon discovered the scene. Initially
considered irredeemable due to his aggression,

329
00:30:34,585 --> 00:30:39,548
Ace was taken in by Alfred Pennyworth after
buying the animal shelter that initially refused

330
00:30:39,628 --> 00:30:44,651
to give Alfred the dog on account of the abuse
it suffered and its aggressive tendencies.

331
00:30:45,231 --> 00:30:50,034
Over the course of months, Alfred trained Ace
with care and persistence, despite the dog's

332
00:30:50,094 --> 00:30:56,077
frequent attempts to bite him. Alfred's determination
eventually paid off and Ace grew to trust him.

333
00:30:56,526 --> 00:31:02,671
Bruce Wayne, skeptical at first, argued to Alfred
that some traumas are impossible to heal. Though

334
00:31:02,691 --> 00:31:08,015
Bruce was eventually won over when Ace demonstrated
loyalty and intelligence, becoming a trusted

335
00:31:08,055 --> 00:31:14,300
member of the Bat family. That Christmas, Bruce
jokingly presented Ace with a bat-shaped mask,

336
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:20,345
officially christened him Ace the Bat Hound,
and trained him as a tracker and rescue dog.

337
00:31:20,785 --> 00:31:26,298
Ace's loyalty, bravery, and intelligence were
particularly evident during the mission involving

338
00:31:26,438 --> 00:31:32,703
enhanced animals being used for criminal activities.
Ace, along with a group of other animals, including

339
00:31:32,723 --> 00:31:39,149
a speedster turtle, a pickpocket squirrel, a
bear, and a cyborg chicken, worked together

340
00:31:39,189 --> 00:31:45,554
to dismantle a criminal operation run by Dr.
Herbert Schwan, a corrupt veterinarian. Schwan

341
00:31:45,574 --> 00:31:50,658
had been capturing animals and using experimental
treatments to transform them into living weapons

342
00:31:50,698 --> 00:31:55,906
for Gotham's underworld. Ace quickly emerged
as the leader of the group. using his experience

343
00:31:55,926 --> 00:32:01,428
and training to organize a rescue effort for
Batman. He guided the team through the defenses

344
00:32:01,468 --> 00:32:06,991
of the facility holding Batman, evading traps
and confronting a dog trained specifically

345
00:32:07,231 --> 00:32:14,494
for Lex Luthor, named Lix Luthor, prior to Luthor
realizing he had dog allergies. Along the way,

346
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:19,876
Ace's leadership and resourcefulness earned
the trust of his new allies, who followed his

347
00:32:19,916 --> 00:32:25,146
commands despite the casualties to rescue a
captured Batman. Ace also played a pivotal

348
00:32:25,186 --> 00:32:30,830
role in mentoring Hayley, also known as Bitewing,
a three-legged dog under the care of Nightwing

349
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:36,755
and Oracle. When Hayley struggled to adjust
to her new life and role, Ace offered guidance

350
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:42,359
and support, helping her navigate the challenges
of being part of a superpets team led by Crypto.

351
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:48,303
Although Hayley ultimately chose to forge her
own path apart from the team, Ace's patience

352
00:32:48,323 --> 00:32:53,730
and wisdom left a lasting impression on her.
And that's Ace the Bat Hound. Abilities-wise,

353
00:32:54,151 --> 00:32:59,354
Ace the Bat-Hound possesses exceptional tracking
and rescue abilities, having undergone rigorous

354
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:04,438
training to assist Batman in crime fighting
as well as search and rescue missions. As a

355
00:33:04,478 --> 00:33:09,682
highly intelligent and loyal German Shepherd,
Ace is capable of understanding complex commands

356
00:33:10,062 --> 00:33:15,867
and responding to cues with precision, even
in high stress situations. His tactical vest

357
00:33:15,907 --> 00:33:21,110
is outfitted with a variety of tools and gadgets
to aid in missions. These include miniature

358
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:26,695
bat-shaped smoke pellets for creating distractions,
a radio communicator for staying in contact

359
00:33:26,955 --> 00:33:33,000
with the bat family, a small med kit for emergency
first aid, a flashlight for low visibility

360
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:38,765
environments, and a collapsible rope for search
and rescue operations. Additionally, his vest

361
00:33:38,785 --> 00:33:44,310
features reinforced armor plating, providing
ace with protection in dangerous encounters.

362
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:50,550
Ace's physical prowess includes enhanced speed,
strength, and agility. for a dog of his breed,

363
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:56,992
making him adept at subduing criminals and navigating
challenging terrain. His acute senses of smell

364
00:33:57,072 --> 00:34:02,833
and hearing allow him to detect explosives,
track individuels, and alert Batman to potential

365
00:34:02,893 --> 00:34:08,535
threats. That's Ace the Bat Hound. The most
recent version of Ace, his backstory went a

366
00:34:08,555 --> 00:34:12,996
little bit more hard than I thought it would,
honestly, but it's a great origin story for

367
00:34:13,136 --> 00:34:19,470
a dog that would belong to Batman. Yeah, actually
that storyline won an Eisner Award. Okay, I

368
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:25,956
could totally see that. Yeah, it's kind of heartbreaking
stuff. But you love to see animals come through

369
00:34:25,996 --> 00:34:29,899
with owners who truly get them and care about
them. And it seems like Batman does considering

370
00:34:29,939 --> 00:34:35,364
he's also, you know, a trauma survivor. Exactly.
Yeah, the whole notion that Batman was like,

371
00:34:35,785 --> 00:34:41,270
you can't heal this dog, he's gone through too
much pain was, of course, a direct analogy

372
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:46,638
to Bruce's own pain and Alfred recognized that
he wanted to prove Bruce wrong. Is the League

373
00:34:46,658 --> 00:34:52,161
of Superpets book a children's comic title kind
of in the same vein as Pet Avengers? No, it's

374
00:34:52,201 --> 00:34:58,824
not an ongoing series. The times that the League
of Superpets have made appearances, they were

375
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:03,927
always called the League of Superpets. They
just appeared like in backup Batman stories

376
00:35:04,287 --> 00:35:09,550
or you know like their own one-off special issues.
Gotcha. Well Dogpool's origin story beats that

377
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:13,732
out of the water. In fact, it won a Nobel Peace
Prize. Oh my gosh. Let me tell you about it.

378
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:21,270
Wade Wilson, the dog. was born astray in the
alternate dimension of Earth-10-3173. He lived

379
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:26,593
his life on the streets as a happy flea-ridden
mongrel, barking all night and chewing up shoes

380
00:35:26,633 --> 00:35:31,717
he found. Eventually, however, he was rounded
up and taken to a secret lab for experimental

381
00:35:31,757 --> 00:35:38,542
cosmetics testing. Evil scientists Dr. Von Braun
and his assistant Igor worked under the Mascara-X

382
00:35:38,622 --> 00:35:44,362
project, aiming to develop an eye mascara that
could regenerate indefinitely. The pair submerged

383
00:35:44,402 --> 00:35:49,326
Wilson in an experimental chemical vat that
painfully transformed the dog, leaving him

384
00:35:49,386 --> 00:35:55,190
horribly mutated but granting him an extraordinary
healing factor. Unaware of his newfound abilities,

385
00:35:55,250 --> 00:36:00,033
the scientists discarded Wilson as a failed
experiment, placing him in a garbage bag and

386
00:36:00,073 --> 00:36:05,317
tossing him into a dumpster, leaving him to
die. Wade's regenerative powers soon revived

387
00:36:05,377 --> 00:36:08,759
him and he escaped the trash to wander the city
for someone to love him.

388
00:36:12,694 --> 00:36:18,238
Wade's despair led him to throw himself in front
of a car, seeking to end his loneliness. However,

389
00:36:18,298 --> 00:36:22,901
Wade survived his attempt, and he was discovered
by a group of circus clowns passing by who

390
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:28,185
recognized his indestructible nature. They brought
him to the circus, which exploited his abilities,

391
00:36:28,525 --> 00:36:33,709
branding him Deadpool the Dare Devil Dog. They
featured him in their death-defying acts, including

392
00:36:33,749 --> 00:36:38,252
shooting him out of a cannon, using him as target
practice for the circus knife thrower, and

393
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:42,610
having him leap through flaming hoops. Some
people came from near and far to witness Wade's

394
00:36:42,650 --> 00:36:47,693
stunts, but despite his newfound fame, the constant
cycle of death and revival weighed heavily

395
00:36:47,753 --> 00:36:52,975
on him. Wade questioned his reality, his purpose,
and the true meaning of his seemingly cursed

396
00:36:53,015 --> 00:36:58,317
existence. Word of the immortal stunt dog eventually
reached the cosmetic scientists who created

397
00:36:58,357 --> 00:37:03,579
him, Dr. Von Braun and Igor. Seeking to recapture
their subject, they experimented on another

398
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:10,502
dog, giving him adamantium claws and naming
him Wolverine. confronted Wade at the circus,

399
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:15,365
however Wade outsmarted his rival by launching
him from the circus cannon. At this point,

400
00:37:15,485 --> 00:37:21,149
Deadpool, of the primary Marvel Earth 616 appeared,
recruiting Dogpool to join the Deadpool Corps,

401
00:37:21,289 --> 00:37:26,932
a band of mercenaries united to protect the
multiverse. The team, which included Lady Deadpool,

402
00:37:27,092 --> 00:37:31,815
Kidpool, and Headpool, embarked on a series
of wild and dangerous missions to safeguard

403
00:37:31,855 --> 00:37:37,246
reality, battling threats such as the Awareness,
the Champion, and the Grandmaster. Despite

404
00:37:37,286 --> 00:37:42,507
the absurdity and peril of the core's adventures,
Doc Poole found a sense of belonging and family

405
00:37:42,667 --> 00:37:47,449
among his fellow mercenaries. He especially
bonded with Kid Poole, the child version of

406
00:37:47,509 --> 00:37:52,850
Deadpool. You can learn more about Deadpool
in his duel against Deathstroke. However, tragedy

407
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:58,552
stuck when an evil version of the Deadpool core,
led by the murderous Dreadpool, began hunting

408
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:03,958
and killing their counterparts across the multiverse.
As part of the resistance against them, Dogpool

409
00:38:04,018 --> 00:38:09,742
journeyed to Earth-616 to warn its Deadpool
of the impending danger. In a climactic confrontation

410
00:38:09,782 --> 00:38:15,306
between the good and evil Deadpool cores, Dogpool
sacrificed himself to save Deadpool by leaping

411
00:38:15,346 --> 00:38:20,470
in the way of a disintegration beam. His ultimate
sacrifice left a lasting impact on Kidpool

412
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:25,654
and the rest of the core, who went on to defeat
the Dreadpool core in revenge. Though presumed

413
00:38:25,734 --> 00:38:31,506
dead, Dogpool's uncanny ability to survive seemingly
anything led to his return. when he teamed

414
00:38:31,566 --> 00:38:36,929
up with Catpool and Mousepool to break the fourth
wall and attack the Marvel Comics editorial

415
00:38:36,969 --> 00:38:42,192
team, convincing them to give the trio their
own monthly Infinity Comics series. In his

416
00:38:42,252 --> 00:38:47,835
new adventures, Dogpool went on to kill mercenaries
at his new farmhouse, steal and bury one of

417
00:38:47,895 --> 00:38:53,618
Deadpool's arm bones, pee in Kat Loki's litter
box on Asgard, save Deadpool when he fell in

418
00:38:53,678 --> 00:39:01,106
a well, get drunk in Boston, and help Deadpool
save Christmas. And that's his backstory. Dogpool's

419
00:39:01,146 --> 00:39:05,568
main ability is to heal at an accelerated rate
through his healing factor. This allows him

420
00:39:05,608 --> 00:39:09,911
to recover and regenerate from any wound he
suffers as well as make him immune to disease

421
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:14,973
and toxins and grant him increased stamina.
He's highly agile, faster than your average

422
00:39:15,013 --> 00:39:19,136
human, approaching 50 miles per hour on foot,
and is strong enough to easily bring down an

423
00:39:19,196 --> 00:39:24,018
enemy. He has sharp canine teeth and claws,
and also typically carries an assortment of

424
00:39:24,078 --> 00:39:29,661
weapons and explosives in his suit, including
a knife, sometimes a gun, and just a few grenades.

425
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:35,072
And that's Dogpool. But how does he use a gun?
I've never seen him use a gun in the comics.

426
00:39:35,593 --> 00:39:42,957
I'll say that. He just carries it for like intimidation
factor? I guess so. Yeah, actually, Ace doesn't

427
00:39:43,137 --> 00:39:50,561
use any of his weapons either or gear. Essentially,
it's just there for his teammates to use should

428
00:39:50,581 --> 00:39:56,885
they need it. So he's like a pack mule. Yeah,
pretty much exactly. I have seen Dogpool carry

429
00:39:56,905 --> 00:40:01,805
a knife in his mouth. Well, I've seen Ace have
batarangs in his mouth as well in the comments.

430
00:40:01,965 --> 00:40:07,509
So there. Playing fetch or something? Yes. That's
pretty cute.

Visit dynamicpodcast.com where we settle the
debate and settle the score.

438
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:05,253
Well now that we got the dog's histories and
abilities out of the way, let's speculate on

439
00:41:05,313 --> 00:41:11,137
how one of the 1000 simulated matches will go,
but in a dog show. The winner of the dog show

440
00:41:11,157 --> 00:41:16,322
will be determined by simulations, not our speculation,
but it's fun to imagine how the dog show could

441
00:41:16,362 --> 00:41:23,087
play out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?
Well I should say there are no rules. Other

442
00:41:23,127 --> 00:41:26,970
than the characters have no prior knowledge
of the other going into the show. All they

443
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:30,933
are aware of starting out is that the other
character is an opponent that needs to be outdone.

444
00:41:31,854 --> 00:41:37,295
For the speculation, the contestants will compete
in a variety of events to showcase their skills.

445
00:41:37,335 --> 00:41:42,716
Alright then, let's get into it! Ace the Bat
Hound and Dog Pool meet in the arena. Who goes

446
00:41:42,756 --> 00:41:47,558
first? Okay, I think Ace the Bat Hound will
go first in their first annual dynamic duel

447
00:41:47,598 --> 00:41:52,479
kennel club dog show. First off will be the
agility trials, which feature a high speed

448
00:41:52,579 --> 00:41:58,241
obstacle course that will test the dog's speed
and evasiveness. For this challenge, the two

449
00:41:58,261 --> 00:42:03,350
will take turns chasing a fake rabbit down a
track. while avoiding cannon fire and maneuvering

450
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:09,013
around lava pits. Yeah, that's right. I must
say too, Ace looks quite statuesque as he's

451
00:42:09,053 --> 00:42:14,575
waiting for the starting signal. And there it
is! Ace is off! Oh, and he trips right out

452
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:21,298
of the gate! Womp womp. What? Okay. Well, like
a true ninja in training, Ace comes out of

453
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:25,900
the stumble with a quick tuck and roll, and
he's back on his feet chasing after the rabbit,

454
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:31,415
picking up momentum as he approaches the first
turn. and then a cannonball fires straight

455
00:42:31,495 --> 00:42:37,578
at him. But without losing his stride, Ace ducks
beneath the cannonball and is starting to close

456
00:42:37,598 --> 00:42:42,882
the gap as he comes upon the lava pit. And look
at that! Instead of chancing the leap, Ace

457
00:42:42,922 --> 00:42:48,525
runs alongside the fenced wall around the pit
and gets to the other side unscathed. He's

458
00:42:48,565 --> 00:42:53,868
close to the rabbit now, it looks like he's
about to snatch it. OH! He got him with lightning

459
00:42:53,928 --> 00:42:59,457
speed! And wow, he is- tearing that thing to
shreds. Great performance overall though. We'll

460
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:05,823
see how dogpool compares. Okay so uh dogpool
is at the track starting line. He's looking

461
00:43:05,883 --> 00:43:11,588
a little bit less statuesque as ace did. Yeah
probably because he's licking his asshole.

462
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:18,995
Yes anyway there's the starting signal and dogpool
tears off like a rabbit animal chasing that

463
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:24,112
rabbit. All right here comes the cannonball.
except dogpole leaps over the cannonball like

464
00:43:24,152 --> 00:43:30,957
in slow motion bullet time doggy matrix style
oh but it just barely clips his hind legs causing

465
00:43:30,997 --> 00:43:36,762
him to cartwheel through the air oh and it looks
like it knocked him across the field into the

466
00:43:36,862 --> 00:43:41,806
lava pit that's not going to be good all right
okay so he's crawling out of the lava pit i

467
00:43:41,846 --> 00:43:49,292
can see his spleen but it looks like his healing
factor is kicking in as he continues to chase

468
00:43:49,332 --> 00:43:54,921
the rabbit while on fire and with one leg still
missing. What an inspiration, because he's

469
00:43:54,961 --> 00:43:59,725
got it. He's got the rabbit now. Wait, what
is he doing to the rabbit? Oh, he's humping

470
00:43:59,905 --> 00:44:05,490
it. He's really going at it. That is not going
to make the network sensors happy, but let's

471
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:11,194
see if it affects the judges' scores as Dogpool
finishes up whatever he's doing. This is Scotty

472
00:44:11,214 --> 00:44:17,059
Macho here, and I'm down here on the track,
and we are checking our contestants for speed.

473
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:22,979
The first one was Ace the Bat Hound. Guy didn't
have a good start, but he was able to snatch

474
00:44:22,999 --> 00:44:29,843
that thing up right away and rip into pieces.
A seven for Ace. Now Dogpool, he was able to

475
00:44:29,863 --> 00:44:34,806
grab that rabbit pretty quick, but then started
humping it right away too. But, I mean, as

476
00:44:34,946 --> 00:44:40,886
ugly as that little thing is, he's still pretty
quick. So we gave him a seven too. For the

477
00:44:40,926 --> 00:44:47,114
category of evasiveness, I'm gonna have to give
Dogpull a six out of seven. I mean, that's

478
00:44:47,154 --> 00:44:53,102
pretty good, but he definitely did rely on his
regenerative abilities more to help him. Which

479
00:44:53,142 --> 00:44:57,724
is not bad. That's smart fighting. That's nothing
wrong with that to use your abilities to your

480
00:44:57,744 --> 00:45:03,086
advantage such as that That's for ace the bat
hound. I'm gonna have to give him a seven out

481
00:45:03,106 --> 00:45:07,969
of seven I mean it clearly shows he was trained
by Batman also not Batman But he had the bat

482
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:13,351
family with him so much more to be trained on
than just one person Supporting him in this

483
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:19,394
role. So seven out of seven for about back to
you guys All right next up is the might and

484
00:45:19,434 --> 00:45:27,737
resilience challenge a where dog's pull a weighted
dummy from a burning collapsing structure.

485
00:45:28,277 --> 00:45:33,578
Is this PETA approved? I'm gonna say no. Alright
dog pool goes first and he's given the go-ahead

486
00:45:33,738 --> 00:45:38,719
as he races into the burning building to get
at that dummy on the top floor. Now we made

487
00:45:38,759 --> 00:45:44,580
sure to let the structure burn for a while so
it's literally falling apart during this trial.

488
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:50,221
Alright sure enough as dog pool is climbing
that first set of stairs they collapse on him.

489
00:45:50,601 --> 00:45:58,228
Oh! and a burning wooden shard just impaled
one of dogpool's limbs. Again? Well, all right,

490
00:45:58,248 --> 00:46:02,969
the three legged pooch. He's just an inspiration
as he fights his way to the top to get at the

491
00:46:03,009 --> 00:46:09,311
dummy and he starts dragging the dummy to safety
by his leg. Now, these dummies weigh like 300

492
00:46:09,611 --> 00:46:16,793
pounds, folks. They're like what we call hefty
or thicc. The building is starting to fully

493
00:46:16,813 --> 00:46:22,895
come down around dogpool. Can he drag the dummy
out to safety in time? Let's see. Oh, holy

494
00:46:22,915 --> 00:46:27,237
shit. He just leaped out of one of the windows,
tossing the dummy out the window with him.

495
00:46:27,698 --> 00:46:32,820
But it looks like he's maneuvering himself beneath
the dummy midair to use himself as a landing

496
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:38,302
pad. And splat! Looks like the dummy is fine
in dog pool. Like he doesn't look fine, but

497
00:46:38,682 --> 00:46:42,824
he's coming around and at least he has all four
of his legs back. Yeah, they're just all going

498
00:46:42,864 --> 00:46:48,523
in different directions though. Overall. I'd
call this a good showing for the Merc with

499
00:46:48,543 --> 00:46:54,226
the Bark. Okay, now Ace is up. There's the signal,
so there he goes, rushing into the building

500
00:46:54,286 --> 00:46:59,169
with zero hesitation, like a true hero. And
there go the stairs, they're crumbling beneath

501
00:46:59,189 --> 00:47:04,612
them. And he gets hit with some debris, it looks
like. Oh, but he shrugs it off and leaps onto

502
00:47:04,632 --> 00:47:10,415
the landing just in time. And he's located the
dummy. Well, why is he checking the dummy's

503
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:15,178
vitals? Like, what is he doing? Does he have
time for this? I don't think so. Hey man, there's

504
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:20,299
always time for safety. But it looks like now
the ace is dragging the dummy up the next flight

505
00:47:20,339 --> 00:47:25,300
of stairs to the roof. Why is he going upstairs?
The structure is crumbling down at this point.

506
00:47:25,741 --> 00:47:30,742
What is he gonna do? Well, it looks like he's
wrapped a harness around the dummy and is now,

507
00:47:30,762 --> 00:47:35,803
what, he's scratching his neck? Oh no, he's
actually triggered a grapple line from his

508
00:47:35,843 --> 00:47:41,745
collar. And now both he and the dummy are sliding
down it to the ground below just as the structure

509
00:47:41,765 --> 00:47:46,436
collapses. Well done. That dog is something
else man, let's see what the judges have to

510
00:47:46,456 --> 00:47:46,637
say.

511
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:56,112
the event. Ace the Bat Hound has clearly been
trained by the Dark Knight in all manner of

512
00:47:56,152 --> 00:48:00,774
strength training exercises and has been fed
a specialized diet for optimal muscularity.

513
00:48:01,194 --> 00:48:05,596
And though Dogpool has the appearance of a stray
who eats mostly leftover chimichangas from

514
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:10,838
the Del Taco dumpster and snorts too much cocaine,
he seems to be able to compensate through his

515
00:48:10,878 --> 00:48:16,161
regenerative healing factor that keeps his body
in good condition. We the judges award both

516
00:48:16,221 --> 00:48:18,722
dogs a 7 out of 7. A perfect score.

517
00:48:21,784 --> 00:48:28,652
results for the durability portion of our dog
show today and coming in with a perfect score

518
00:48:28,692 --> 00:48:38,219
of seven we have ace the bat hound now y'all
might be wondering He comes in with a 10. Why

519
00:48:38,259 --> 00:48:43,020
do we give him a 10? I mean, look, you could
chop off his arm, it's gonna grow back. Look

520
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,921
at the healing factor on him. The durability
is off the charts, so we have to give him an

521
00:48:47,001 --> 00:48:52,743
off the charts score. Okay, the next event is
a search and solve competition. It's a scavenger

522
00:48:52,783 --> 00:48:58,404
hunt style event that tests the dog's perception
and intelligence as they navigate a labyrinth

523
00:48:58,784 --> 00:49:04,158
and avoid tasty distractions in order to locate
the drugs that are hidden. in the center of

524
00:49:04,178 --> 00:49:10,083
the maze. And there's the signal. Ace rushes
into the labyrinth. I expect nothing less from

525
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:14,647
him by this point. Looks like he's sniffing
around now, but has he caught the scent of

526
00:49:14,707 --> 00:49:20,452
the drugs? Oh, look at that. It looks like Ace
has walked right into a dead end. How unfortunate

527
00:49:20,472 --> 00:49:25,736
for that guy. And at the dead end, there's a
plate full of meaty steaks there, cooked rare.

528
00:49:25,936 --> 00:49:33,899
Yummy. Which Ace completely ignores, the dedication.
Oh, what is he doing now? Look, he's digging

529
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:39,304
under the wall. No dead end is gonna stop him
from getting to his target. Oh, but look, he

530
00:49:39,384 --> 00:49:44,629
stops digging for a second. He must detect the
bitch in heat that was placed in the maze that's

531
00:49:44,649 --> 00:49:51,596
like right above him. Oh, he's digging into
his tactical vest now. What does he have in

532
00:49:51,616 --> 00:49:56,941
there? Oh, it's a gas mask muzzle. Wow, he must
be confident in the location of the drugs by

533
00:49:57,001 --> 00:50:01,672
this point. to use a tool like that to avoid
the scent of romance and stick to his mission.

534
00:50:01,873 --> 00:50:06,816
And sure enough, he's dug right through the
maze and is now beneath the drugs. He's found

535
00:50:06,856 --> 00:50:12,440
them and let out a victorious howl. Mission
accomplished. All right. Now it's Dogpool's

536
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:18,885
turn. So Dogpool rushes into the labyrinth and
he's using his skilled nose to try and locate

537
00:50:18,905 --> 00:50:23,488
the devil's lettuce that's hidden in this maze,
which is a slang term for marijuana, kids.

538
00:50:24,009 --> 00:50:28,947
But oh, no. He stumbled upon a plate full of
chimichangas, and he eats them all without

539
00:50:28,967 --> 00:50:34,268
even chewing, it looks like. Ha ha ha. Yeah,
it makes sense for the character, for sure.

540
00:50:34,768 --> 00:50:41,490
But oh, we laced them with sleeping pills. That
will cost him. Except, Dogpool's healing factor

541
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:48,072
should help filter out that poison. So, he's
fine. He keeps going. It's fine. Yeah, but

542
00:50:48,112 --> 00:50:52,093
it looks like he's moving away from the center,
towards the direction of the French poodle

543
00:50:52,133 --> 00:50:58,808
and heat. and he gives into the temptation.
Okay, okay, sure. But Dogpull's like really

544
00:50:58,828 --> 00:51:03,670
quick, okay? He's like a two pump chump. And
so he's like in and out literally and moves

545
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:10,313
on. Finally approaching the bag of weed and
he finds it. What a champ, you know, his tail's

546
00:51:10,373 --> 00:51:15,016
wagging. He looks like a happy boy. Yeah, maybe
a little too happy because he just straight

547
00:51:15,056 --> 00:51:18,177
up devoured the weed like the police are knocking
on his door.

548
00:51:21,666 --> 00:51:26,209
Well, let's see what the judges have to say.
And now moving on to the intelligence category.

549
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:31,834
Ace is pretty much a genius. I mean, it's pretty
hard to describe Ace as anything other than

550
00:51:31,854 --> 00:51:37,678
a genius. And unfortunately, dog pool is just
dumb. I can't really describe dog pool any

551
00:51:37,718 --> 00:51:44,424
other way. As intelligence goes, dog pool is
probably even less intelligent than an actual

552
00:51:44,464 --> 00:51:50,989
dog. So sad. So this category goes to Ace the
bat hound with a seven to dog pools measly

553
00:51:51,229 --> 00:51:57,938
one. And next we have the perception event.
Looks like Ace scores a perfect seven due to

554
00:51:57,978 --> 00:52:04,302
his superior training. The dog pool only gets
a three because he passed the drug sniff test

555
00:52:04,703 --> 00:52:11,167
but got too high on marijuana. Unfortunate.
Next up is the attack skills showcase, an action

556
00:52:11,207 --> 00:52:16,951
packed challenge highlighting the dog's fighting
skills and versatility where they must each

557
00:52:16,991 --> 00:52:22,751
take down a squad of ninjas in a warehouse setting.
Yeah, Dogpool is gonna go first, and it looks

558
00:52:22,771 --> 00:52:28,895
like he sees the group of ninjas enter his warehouse
location. And he sees them circle around him.

559
00:52:29,416 --> 00:52:34,039
Yeah, but as he turns to look at each one, he
keeps turning and turning because he's chasing

560
00:52:34,099 --> 00:52:40,803
his own tail. Alright, so, okay, so he's a little
distracted at the outset, and one of the ninjas

561
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:45,227
lunges at Dogpool with his bow staff. But, you
know, getting conked on the rear with the staff

562
00:52:45,707 --> 00:52:50,828
is gonna snap Dogpool out of chasing his tail,
and he's no longer distracted. and he snarls

563
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:58,486
and lunges back at the Bo Staff Ninja, straight
up ripping his crotch from his body. Oh shit!

564
00:52:58,506 --> 00:53:06,954
That guy was a volunteer! One down, three to
go. The next ninja is wielding a pair of scythes

565
00:53:07,134 --> 00:53:13,400
and he stabs Dogpool. Dude, what a dickhead.
Attacking a dog like that? Deadpool straight

566
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:19,145
up rips that guy's dick from his pants. Again?
Yeah. All right, Dogpool seems to be using

567
00:53:19,286 --> 00:53:25,551
a very specific fighting style to disable these
opponents. I hope they already have children.

568
00:53:26,012 --> 00:53:31,275
Yeah, the style is called Wing Chun. Well the
third ninja runs at dogpool with his nunchucks

569
00:53:31,435 --> 00:53:37,678
spinning around. And then dogpool throws a dagger
right in the guy's nutsack. A dagger? Yeah

570
00:53:37,718 --> 00:53:43,320
from his utility belt. And now the final ninja
with swords looks like he's trying to actually

571
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:47,542
run out of the arena. But dogpool is going to
grab the guy by the seat of his pants just

572
00:53:47,642 --> 00:53:53,365
ripping him and pulling the last ninja to the
ground. And then OH MY GOD the guy just exploded.

573
00:53:54,225 --> 00:53:59,995
What happened? Looks like Dogpool must have
dropped a grenade down the ninja's hole in

574
00:54:00,035 --> 00:54:06,397
his pants. Wow, this battle felt very personal.
Like a ninja must have been the one that neutered

575
00:54:06,497 --> 00:54:11,678
Dogpool back when he was a stray or something.
We can only assume, I guess. Well it's Ace's

576
00:54:11,718 --> 00:54:16,900
turn and I have to say I'm expecting a good
show from him. The Bat Family has trained for

577
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:23,790
this exact scenario. The four ninjas surround
Ace and he's rolling over and- OH! The warehouse

578
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:29,454
is now filled with smoke. He must have triggered
a smoke capsule in his tactical vest. Okay,

579
00:54:29,955 --> 00:54:33,398
it looks like we're gonna have to switch to
our infrared cameras. And it looks like the

580
00:54:33,438 --> 00:54:39,282
ninjas cannot see him through the smoke. Oh,
look, there he is in the rafters. How does

581
00:54:39,362 --> 00:54:45,648
a dog get in the rafters? It looks like he's
lowering a looped cable. The sword ninja doesn't

582
00:54:45,668 --> 00:54:51,132
appear to see he's walking right into the trap.
Oh, there he goes. The ninja gets lifted into

583
00:54:51,152 --> 00:54:58,533
the air, and dropping his swords. Uh, it looks
like the ninja with the scythe heard the swords

584
00:54:58,593 --> 00:55:04,457
dropping to the floor, and he looks upward and
he throws one of his scythes into the rafters

585
00:55:04,558 --> 00:55:10,802
at Ace. And like any good boy playing fetch,
Ace catches the scythe in his jaws and he spins

586
00:55:10,842 --> 00:55:14,625
it back around at the ninja. And look, it stuck
him in that foot. That ninja will probably

587
00:55:14,665 --> 00:55:19,728
be pinned there for a while. Pretty painful.
Oh, but it looks like the smoke screen is starting

588
00:55:19,768 --> 00:55:24,367
to clear from the warehouse, so- These guys
are gonna be able to see Ace now. Oh, but where

589
00:55:24,387 --> 00:55:30,909
did Ace go? Oh, there he is behind the Bo Staff
Ninja. Did he just paw chop him in the neck?

590
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:37,452
Wow, Bo Staff Ninja's down with a nerve strike.
Oh, but look, Nunchuck Ninja spotted Ace, and

591
00:55:37,472 --> 00:55:42,214
he pounces on him, and now he has one of his
Nunchucks wrapped around Ace's neck. Okay,

592
00:55:42,234 --> 00:55:46,036
well, it looks like Ace is pulling hard away
from the Ninja. You know, he's pretty strong

593
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:50,870
for a dog. Oh, it looks like he was using the
Ninja's weight against him. pulling the ninja

594
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:56,593
low to the ground and setting him up for one
tremendous headbutt. That ninja is seeing ninja

595
00:55:56,693 --> 00:56:01,495
stars right now. What a masterful performance
from a doggy martial arts master if I've ever

596
00:56:01,536 --> 00:56:08,179
seen one. Let's see what the judges say. Wow,
what a great showing for these two dogs in

597
00:56:08,219 --> 00:56:15,095
the fighting category. For this category, we
were looking for how- these dogs would face

598
00:56:15,196 --> 00:56:23,427
off against each other. And Ace the Bat Hound,
just like his master, came in with great precision

599
00:56:23,627 --> 00:56:31,517
and didn't miss a beat. He scored a perfect
seven. Whereas his opponent, Dogpool, only

600
00:56:31,866 --> 00:56:40,550
scored a six because he was constantly getting
distracted by his own tail. What a great show

601
00:56:40,770 --> 00:56:47,233
so far and I cannot wait to see the rest of
the results from the other categories. When

602
00:56:47,273 --> 00:56:53,536
it comes to versatility, these dogs are collar
and collar. Ace is the world's greatest dogtective,

603
00:56:53,816 --> 00:56:59,078
which means he has a variety of useful skills
like sniffing, sneaking, snarling, and of course

604
00:56:59,098 --> 00:57:07,884
sleuthing. though he prefers not to use it because
he is a very good boy. Dogpool, on the other

605
00:57:07,904 --> 00:57:12,647
hand, may appear to be a chaotic mess, but this
is just because he's a real Jack Russell of

606
00:57:12,687 --> 00:57:18,191
all trades. Just kidding, he's a mutt. But he
does do his own stunts because he can heal

607
00:57:18,211 --> 00:57:23,534
from just about anything. He also has knowledge
on a variety of subjects due to all Deadpool's

608
00:57:23,554 --> 00:57:28,618
ability to break the fourth wall, giving them
a certain sense of omniscience. In either case,

609
00:57:28,718 --> 00:57:33,581
both these canines exhibit just about any skill
they need. need to get the job done and for

610
00:57:33,621 --> 00:57:40,665
that reason we are proud to award both of them
a perfect seven in versatility. The last event

611
00:57:40,745 --> 00:57:46,308
is the precision range test, a targeting competition
testing range and damage potential where the

612
00:57:46,348 --> 00:57:51,311
two dogs will use their unique abilities to
accurately hit and or destroy moving targets

613
00:57:51,631 --> 00:57:57,822
of various compositions. Ace is going first
in this final test and it looks like his projectiles

614
00:57:57,862 --> 00:58:04,424
of choice are a collection of Batarangs. Interesting.
Picking up the first one, Ace is staring intently,

615
00:58:04,704 --> 00:58:09,205
waiting for the first targets to appear. Can
dogs really throw well enough for this event?

616
00:58:09,766 --> 00:58:14,907
I guess we'll see. The first clay targets get
launched, and we're skeet shooting here! Ah

617
00:58:14,967 --> 00:58:22,129
skeet skeet! Like a discus thrower, Ace spins
around and hurls a volley of three Batarangs!

618
00:58:22,754 --> 00:58:28,715
Bam bam one two three all targets were shattered
by ace of course all right the next targets

619
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:36,278
appear and these guys look like dartboards swinging
like pendulums and The dartboards are wooden

620
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:42,059
in composition all right ace is winding up,
and there's the pitch Oh, no, it looks like

621
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:50,370
ace missed one wait the one that missed is circling
back around like a boomerang Oh Ace bulls-eyed

622
00:58:50,390 --> 00:58:55,752
the dartboard from behind! Look the tip of the
battering is sticking through the board into

623
00:58:55,772 --> 00:59:00,054
the front side. Where does this dog get his
wonderful toys? That's what I want to know.

624
00:59:00,514 --> 00:59:06,057
The final round of the targets are appearing
now. They're human figures composed of ballistic

625
00:59:06,097 --> 00:59:12,319
gel so that we can get accurate damage analysis.
But the figures are moving swiftly on a conveyor

626
00:59:12,339 --> 00:59:17,958
belt. It looks like Ace is grabbing a different
style of battering. I wonder which kind. All

627
00:59:17,978 --> 00:59:23,002
right, Ace is taking aim. And wow, instead of
spinning this time, he does a back flip. And

628
00:59:23,062 --> 00:59:29,187
look, he used three different types of batterings.
The first target is now melting from the electric

629
00:59:29,227 --> 00:59:34,712
shock it's receiving. The second one looks like
a pin cushion with sharp battering sticking

630
00:59:34,772 --> 00:59:39,876
out from its vital pressure points. And the
third one is just frozen solid. What a solid

631
00:59:39,896 --> 00:59:46,421
way to wrap up his performance at this show.
What a show off that dog is, but you know.

632
00:59:46,902 --> 00:59:51,603
Dogpool's ready to go now, and he didn't come
to play. The first targets are launched into

633
00:59:51,623 --> 00:59:56,404
the air. All right, maybe he did come to play.
Instead of hurling a projectile at the clay

634
00:59:56,424 --> 01:00:02,166
targets, Dogpool leaps into the air and snatches
all three of the skeet discs. Maybe he thought

635
01:00:02,186 --> 01:00:07,748
this was a Frisbee game or something, but he
did crack the discs with his teeth. So maybe

636
01:00:07,988 --> 01:00:13,109
that will count with the judges? What an idiot!
Looks like the second round of targets are

637
01:00:13,149 --> 01:00:18,528
now swinging. And Dogpool has a grenade in his
mouth and he's wagging his tail. Looks like

638
01:00:18,568 --> 01:00:23,291
he sets the grenade down on the floor and he
nudges it with his nose. Like he wants the

639
01:00:23,431 --> 01:00:29,374
targets to throw it for him. What? Oh wait,
look, the grenade is rolling and it's rolling.

640
01:00:29,574 --> 01:00:35,938
It keeps rolling and it blows up, destroying
all three targets. And Dogpool himself, that

641
01:00:35,978 --> 01:00:42,190
grenade trap now travels pretty far. He'll walk
it off. All right. The final challenge. The

642
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:47,834
ballistic gel torsos are moving down the conveyor
belt. And it looks like Deadpool pulls out,

643
01:00:47,974 --> 01:00:55,759
oh my God, is that a rocket launcher? And it's
red, it's so big and red. It's a red rocket

644
01:00:55,779 --> 01:01:00,202
launcher. I don't even know how Doc Pull's gonna
use it, but oh, it looks like he's pressing

645
01:01:00,222 --> 01:01:06,547
the trigger with his paw. Kabooy, there goes
all the targets and most of the arena itself.

646
01:01:07,087 --> 01:01:13,118
Thank goodness we are behind this safety glass.
That final round was intense. Let's hear from

647
01:01:13,158 --> 01:01:18,940
our final judges. In the category of range,
we, the judges, have determined that both Ace

648
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:24,681
the Bat Hound and Dogpool have displayed considerable
skill in their distance and marksmanship. However,

649
01:01:24,721 --> 01:01:30,243
while Ace showed exemplary skill in his ability
to bullseye targets using Batarangs, we feel

650
01:01:30,263 --> 01:01:35,845
that Dogpool's use of throwing grenades insufficiently
demonstrated the same natural skill due to

651
01:01:35,865 --> 01:01:41,843
the weapon's large blast radius. That being
said, Dogpool seems to have a gun pointed at

652
01:01:41,883 --> 01:01:47,245
me as I'm currently reading these results, so
I'm going to award both dogs a perfect score

653
01:01:47,325 --> 01:01:53,908
of 7 out of 7. Alright folks, the results are
it. It would appear that both contestants,

654
01:01:54,048 --> 01:02:01,091
Ace the Batcom and Dogpool, scored a perfect
7 in the damage category. But because Dogpool

655
01:02:01,231 --> 01:02:06,153
is pretty fugly and because his owner has my
family held captive, we're going to award him

656
01:02:06,173 --> 01:02:12,184
3 extra points giving him the win. Wow, Doc
Poole seems pretty desperate to me. Let's take

657
01:02:12,224 --> 01:02:18,549
the judges scores and have our resident Monte
Carlo simulator AJ 9K analyze the data to determine

658
01:02:18,569 --> 01:02:26,535
who wins the inaugural Dynamic Duel Kennel Club
Dog Show. AJ 9K, hit it. Inputting data, running

659
01:02:26,575 --> 01:02:33,259
calculations, processing results, simulations
complete. OK, so when we approached the stats

660
01:02:33,439 --> 01:02:40,391
for this matchup, we knew that Ace was basically
gonna have a perfect score in everything because

661
01:02:40,611 --> 01:02:47,294
he is the perfect dog, particularly when it
would come to dog show style events. Yeah,

662
01:02:47,374 --> 01:02:52,536
I don't think there's any sort of dog show out
there that Ace the Bat Hound would not utterly

663
01:02:52,616 --> 01:02:57,418
dominate. So we definitely approach the stats
from a different angle this go around. It's

664
01:02:57,458 --> 01:03:02,540
not like your standard duel, because speaking
in dog terms, Ace the Bat Hound is a perfect

665
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:08,936
dog. So really the challenge came in seeing
how Dogpool compares to the perfect dog in

666
01:03:08,996 --> 01:03:13,559
all of the stat categories. And there were some
differences. You know, Dogpool, as the judges

667
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:17,662
said, got slightly lower in evasiveness because
he knows that he has his healing factor to

668
01:03:17,722 --> 01:03:23,526
rely on. But he really outclassed Ace the Bat
Hound in durability, of course, because of

669
01:03:23,546 --> 01:03:29,950
his healing factor and damage. Yeah, Dogpool
tends to be much more lethal than Ace, who

670
01:03:30,010 --> 01:03:37,491
follows the same code that his master does of
being non-lethal. Dogpool was less than exemplary

671
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:43,714
compared to Ace though when it came to intelligence
and perception, largely because the dog just

672
01:03:43,734 --> 01:03:48,637
isn't that smart. He's not the type of dog to
follow commands, especially if you classify

673
01:03:48,737 --> 01:03:54,361
intelligence at a dog show through obedience
training. How good are they at following commands

674
01:03:54,841 --> 01:04:00,744
and Dogpool is just an agent of chaos. Well
Joseph, taking all of these stats into consideration,

675
01:04:01,145 --> 01:04:07,039
who do you think is going to come out on top?
I think that dogpool's durability and his lethality

676
01:04:07,199 --> 01:04:11,800
will put him over the edge here. Although Instagram
does not agree with me, it looks like a lot

677
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:19,162
of our followers are voting for Ace to win by
64% over dogpool. But let's find out who actually

678
01:04:19,202 --> 01:04:27,644
won. AJ9k, the results please. Hey Yuasa. The
winner of the matchup between Ace the Bat Hound

679
01:04:28,444 --> 01:04:44,275
and Dogpool is... What? Yes by a whopping 73.7%
win rate compared to dogpool's 26.3% or 263

680
01:04:45,836 --> 01:04:51,240
of the 1000 matches. How is that possible? The
only way that could be is because we didn't

681
01:04:51,300 --> 01:04:56,965
score this like a typical duel. We scored it
like a dog show. I think we should nix that

682
01:04:57,005 --> 01:05:02,289
whole idea and treat this like an actual dogfight
because I straight up guarantee you that dogpool...

683
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:10,253
rips Ace the Bat Hound apart. Okay, Michael
Vick. That's what you want, huh? No. Look,

684
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:14,836
the stats would be fairly comparable, even if
we scored them slightly different. Dogpool

685
01:05:14,876 --> 01:05:20,819
would still come out ahead in terms of durability
and still fall way behind in intellect. Sorry,

686
01:05:20,979 --> 01:05:27,694
Ace the Bat Hound is just elite when it comes
to dog stat categories. Is that so? Well, oh

687
01:05:27,754 --> 01:05:32,497
no, it looks like Dogpool is breaking the fourth
wall and beating the shit out of Ace the bad

688
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:39,481
hound. Looks like we got our dogfight after
all. Yeah, if Dogpool can even touch Ace with
