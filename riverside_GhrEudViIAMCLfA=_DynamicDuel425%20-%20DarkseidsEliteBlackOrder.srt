00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,654 --> 00:00:29,097
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:29,457 --> 00:00:34,641
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based

4
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:41,406
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother Johnny DC. And we got a special

5
00:00:41,446 --> 00:00:47,710
episode for you guys. This is our 425th episode.
And as long time listeners know, every 25 episodes,

6
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,366
we're coming at you guys with a team duel. And
this episode is going to be... Revenge match

7
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:57,969
kind of like a grudge match between Thanos and
Darkseid except they're bringing their posses

8
00:00:58,009 --> 00:01:04,534
with them it's gonna be Darkseids elite versus
the black order and Revenge is gonna be so

9
00:01:04,594 --> 00:01:09,978
sweet from our original Duel episode of dark
side versus Thanos Just laying that out there

10
00:01:10,038 --> 00:01:15,802
right now. Yeah, if any episode deserved a sequel
It would have to be Darkseid versus Thanos

11
00:01:15,882 --> 00:01:20,245
because that has to be one of the most epic
pairings between Marvel and DC characters ever

12
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:25,693
Yeah Right, and this matchup is going to be
equally as epic. Can't wait to see who wins

13
00:01:25,713 --> 00:01:30,076
between Darkseid's elite, which is basically,
you know, his main generals on the planet Apocalypse

14
00:01:30,396 --> 00:01:35,599
versus the Black Order, who non-comic book readers
will definitely recognize from the Infinity

15
00:01:35,639 --> 00:01:40,102
War and endgame films. They're like Thanos'
generals. Before that matchup, we're going

16
00:01:40,122 --> 00:01:44,285
to break down the latest comic book movie news
to come out this past week, of which we have

17
00:01:44,365 --> 00:01:49,709
two news items. We got news that James Watkins
is going to direct the Clayface film that's

18
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:55,861
in development. and we got the official trailer
for Batman Ninja vs Yakuza League. As always

Network this week including Max Destruction
which pits your favorite action heroes from

32
00:03:03,314 --> 00:03:08,276
film and television against each other. This
Wednesday, hosts Scotty and Gilly are finding

33
00:03:08,356 --> 00:03:14,120
out who would win in a fight between the MCU's
Captain America Steve Rogers and the DCEU's

34
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,283
Batman aka Batfleck. Which is a matchup I've
always wanted to see from Max Destruction.

35
00:03:20,643 --> 00:03:24,185
Yeah, it's nice that since we focus on the comic
book characters for our duels that they can

36
00:03:24,534 --> 00:03:29,518
focus on the movie characters. I'm really interested
in that fight too. On the Senjoh World podcast,

37
00:03:29,558 --> 00:03:35,022
host Zachary Hepburn speculates on fights between
fan favorite anime and manga characters. This

38

Thursday, Zach is putting out an epic 10 versus
10 matchup of Team Naruto, AKA the Akatsuki

39
00:03:42,648 --> 00:03:48,673
versus Team Bleach, AKA the Espada. That'll
be a big one. Anime fans definitely check that

40
00:03:48,753 --> 00:03:53,611
out. On the Konsole Kombat podcast, hosts John
and Dean simulate battles between popular video

41
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:58,894

to the no prize. A no prize is an award Marvel

45
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:24,508
used to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic
Duel No Prize, is a digital award we post on

46
00:04:24,628 --> 00:04:30,069
Instagram for the person that we feel gave the
best answer to our question of the week. Last

47
00:04:30,089 --> 00:04:35,791
week we asked you guys, what's your favorite
Captain America solo film and why? And we incorporated

48
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:40,752
all of the Captain America movies, not just
from the MCU franchise, but also through history.

49
00:04:41,092 --> 00:04:44,553
We got three answers, so let's go ahead and
run down the two honorable mentions and the

50
00:04:44,593 --> 00:04:51,168
no prize winner. Our first honorable mention
goes to Lee Tapscott, who said, Hi, this is

51
00:04:51,228 --> 00:04:57,632
Lee. My favorite Captain America project was
Captain America. Seventy five heroic years.

52
00:04:58,192 --> 00:05:05,896
This aired back in 2016 on ABC right before
the premiere of Agent Carter. This is a documentary

53
00:05:05,936 --> 00:05:12,500
movie on the history of Captain America, both
in comics and films, and examine the influence

54
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:18,227
of this character in America culture throughout
the years. with tons of interviews and snippets

55
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:22,009
from movies and comics. Oops, it looks like
he got kind of cut off at the end there, but

56
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:28,172
I remember when this documentary came out. It's
not like a solo film per se, but it was really

57
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:33,215
cool to see comic book and movie creators comment
on the influence of Captain America back when

58
00:05:33,255 --> 00:05:38,918
he first debuted around World War II. There
have been quite a few solid comic book documentaries

59
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:43,821
made over the years. I remember the History
Channel put out an amazing one back in the

60
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:48,629
early 2000s. Oh yeah, wasn't it like comic book
superheroes unmasked? Yeah, I would highly

61
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:53,513
recommend that documentary to anyone who's like
getting into comics. There was also a really

62
00:05:53,573 --> 00:05:58,257
great documentary on the Unbreakable special
features for that movie Unbreakable, since

63
00:05:58,297 --> 00:06:03,081
you know that movie deals with comic books and
superheroes. Oh yeah, great interviews with

64
00:06:03,122 --> 00:06:07,886
comic book creators like Dave Gibbons and Frank
Miller, if I remember correctly. Yeah. DC has

65
00:06:07,906 --> 00:06:13,218
had one TV special documentary-esque type project
that they put out. I think it was right around

66
00:06:13,258 --> 00:06:18,043
the time of Batman v Superman and that was hosted
by Kevin Smith. It was called Dawn of Justice

67
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:24,909
League if I remember correctly. And no one cares
about that one. Oh, I'm sorry. Moving on to

68
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:30,073
our next honorable mention. This next answer
was given by Travis Herndon, who said, What's

69
00:06:30,113 --> 00:06:34,377
up, dynamic dudes? Travis here. Shout out to
my evil twin. So my answer had to be Falcon

70
00:06:34,397 --> 00:06:39,990
and Winter Soldier. Seeing Bucky and Sam having
this buddy cop dynamic was cool. While yeah,

71
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,475
the villains were a big lackluster, getting
introduced to the tragic character of Isaiah

72
00:06:44,515 --> 00:06:50,841
Bradley was powerful, as well as getting introduced
to everybody's favorite party city cat, John

73
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:55,786
Walker. So yeah, Falcon and the Winter Soldier
is my favorite series. Yeah, the Falcon and

74
00:06:55,806 --> 00:07:00,090
the Winter Soldier was a great television show.
It had phenomenal action, especially that Tunisia

75
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:04,546
flight scene from the first episode and the
dynamic between. The Falcon and the Winter

76
00:07:04,586 --> 00:07:09,169
Soldier is really enjoyable. In fact, it's probably
one of the things missing from the recent Brave

77
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:13,912
New World movie. Yeah, Bucky's cameo in that
left a lot to be desired. But yeah, I would

78
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:17,595
say Falcon and the Winter Soldier is definitely
one of Marvel's best television series that

79
00:07:17,615 --> 00:07:23,239
they put out. I love what they did with Baron
Zemo. Didn't love Power Broker, but I loved

80
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:27,902
US Agent and pretty much everything else. I
didn't love Flag Smasher either. Oh yeah, that

81
00:07:27,922 --> 00:07:34,174
was dumb. Great answer, Travis Herndon, but
the winner of this week's No Prize is... Matt

82
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:41,039
from Texas who said, Hey guys, it's Matt from
Texas. Uh, I would say my favorite Captain

83
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:47,384
America movie is probably going to be Captain
America, the first Avenger is the quintessential

84
00:07:47,424 --> 00:07:52,949
Captain America movie. It's where he gets his
start shows who he truly is. And it's world

85
00:07:52,969 --> 00:07:58,653
war II. I love world war II. I study it as a
history major. Um, but yeah, that's it. Peace

86
00:07:58,713 --> 00:08:03,864
out. Yeah, a lot of people love Captain America,
the first Avenger. It's not personally my favorite

87
00:08:04,004 --> 00:08:08,106
Captain America film, but I could see where
a lot of people are coming from when they cite

88
00:08:08,146 --> 00:08:13,068
it as their favorite, because it's probably
the most unique film out of the Captain America

89
00:08:13,228 --> 00:08:17,750
MCU franchise. Right. Usually the franchise
tends to go down the political thriller route.

90
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:25,122
But Captain America took a very pulpy approach
to World War Two. in the vein of films like

91
00:08:25,182 --> 00:08:29,465
Raiders of the Lost Ark or The Rocketeer. In
fact, the guy who directed The First Avenger

92
00:08:29,906 --> 00:08:34,689
also directed The Rocketeer. So there was something
very charming about the film and it just had

93
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:39,932
a lot of heart. Yeah, in my opinion, Captain
America, The First Avenger is the way Captain

94
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:45,456
America movies should be done. These wartime
films where Captain America gets to punch Nazis,

95
00:08:45,777 --> 00:08:51,340
seeing him go up against the Red Skull is so
iconic. For sure, yeah. So great answer, Matt.

96
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:55,395
You win this week's snow prize. If you the listener
want a shot at winning your own no prize, go

97
00:08:55,415 --> 00:08:59,565
ahead and stay tuned to later on this episode
when we'll be asking another question of the

98
00:08:59,585 --> 00:09:02,492
week. And now that that's done, on to the news!

99
00:09:08,034 --> 00:09:13,655
Alright, a few months ago DC Studios announced
that it would be releasing a clay face solo

100
00:09:13,675 --> 00:09:20,977
film produced by Matt Reeves who is the director
of The Batman. We weren't sure if this movie

101
00:09:20,997 --> 00:09:28,339
was going to take place in the DCU or the Elseworlds
universe in which The Batman takes place. We've

102
00:09:28,379 --> 00:09:35,241
since learned that it's going to be a DCU film
directed by James Watkins who has directed

103
00:09:35,381 --> 00:09:42,640
other including Speak No Evil, The Woman in
Black, and The Descent Part 2. None of which

104
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:49,063
I have seen. Not a big horror guy. I haven't
seen any of those either, but Speak No Evil

105
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:53,525
with James McAvoy did look pretty solid. I gotta
check that out. Yeah, that film did pretty

106
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:58,587
well critically too, as have several other of
his projects. Now, the Clayface film is said

107
00:09:58,627 --> 00:10:05,330
to only have a budget of about $40 million,
which is nothing. They're definitely selling

108
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,373
this as a low budget horror project, which,
you know, is not terrible. There have been

109
00:10:10,493 --> 00:10:16,036
a lot of great low budget horror films to have
come out recently that have gotten a lot of

110
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:20,979
acclaim. So there is promise here. Oh, yeah,
I'm super excited by this. It was interesting

111
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:27,142
that we got a look at the DCU version of Clayface
in the recent Creature Commandos animated series.

112
00:10:27,603 --> 00:10:32,345
As those of you have watched the show will know,
Clayface didn't really meet a timely end to

113
00:10:32,385 --> 00:10:36,968
there. but you know, it's really hard to kill
Clayface, so I'm certain that he'll be coming

114
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:42,431
back, but also, this film doesn't have to follow
that series, it could be a prequel. Yeah, honestly,

115
00:10:42,531 --> 00:10:48,114
I hope it is. I hope it starts off something
closer to the Clayface that we got in the Batman

116
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:53,537
Caped Crusader animated series just last year.
Start there and then move into the Creature

117
00:10:53,557 --> 00:10:57,919
Commandos version of Clayface. I think that's
the best way to go. I would agree with that,

118
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:03,203
yeah. As we've talked about earlier, Clayface
is being written by Mike Flanagan who has also

119
00:11:03,243 --> 00:11:08,427
written horror films like Doctor Sleep, The
Haunting, The Fall of the House of Usher, and

120
00:11:08,487 --> 00:11:13,211
The Haunting of Hill House, to name a few. The
film is set to be released on September 11th

121
00:11:13,392 --> 00:11:20,598
of 2026, so look forward to it then. But speaking
of the reveal that James Watkins is set to

122
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:24,101
direct this film, that brings us to our question
of the week.

123
00:11:28,662 --> 00:11:34,125
What horror director would you like to see direct
a film for one of Batman's villains? And which

124
00:11:34,185 --> 00:11:39,047
villain? So we're looking for you guys to pair

Be sure to answer before March 1st. Also in

131
00:12:06,817 --> 00:12:14,144
DC news this past week we got the official trailer
for Batman Ninja vs Yakuza League and it looks

132
00:12:14,304 --> 00:12:22,651
so damn epic and bonkers in the best way possible
just like the first animated film was. I loved

133
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:28,300
that movie. I almost gave that movie 5 stars.
I still enjoy watching that movie and this

134
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:34,084
trailer has me really pumped to see the sequel,
which looks like it picks up right after the

135
00:12:34,124 --> 00:12:39,308
first one ends. Yeah, I really like how the
first Batman Ninja movie really delved into

136
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:44,331
like medieval history of Japan, right? It took
place in a very historical context and now

137
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:50,616
the sequel takes place in a very modern context.
We get to see modern Japan with these Yakuza

138
00:12:50,656 --> 00:12:55,544
gangs going up against each other and I guess
Japan was positioned directly over Gotham City

139
00:12:55,804 --> 00:13:00,628
in this world. Right, because Japan is missing
on the map. Something they did in the past

140
00:13:00,668 --> 00:13:05,852
in the first movie has altered the present.
And it looks like the premise of the film is

141
00:13:05,892 --> 00:13:12,438
that Batman and his team have to go through
the Justice League in order to reset reality.

142
00:13:12,498 --> 00:13:17,182
Fantastic premise. I love seeing all the different
Justice League characters and their designs.

143
00:13:17,723 --> 00:13:22,943
Everything from Jessica Cruz to Aquaman to Flash
and Wonder Woman. look amazing. We haven't

144
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:27,466
seen Superman yet, though I suspect we will.
Maybe he'll be like the big boss at the end.

145
00:13:27,846 --> 00:13:32,709
Yeah, the Shogun. Right, yeah. Russell Gould
was really cool to see. I'm sure he's involved

146
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:37,092
in what's going on in some way. I always love
him as a Batman villain, but we also get to

147
00:13:37,112 --> 00:13:41,736
see other Batman villains like the Joker pop
up as well. This film is going to be so packed,

148
00:13:42,016 --> 00:13:47,139
like with other characters like Robin and Nightwing
and Red Hood, and I'm totally here for it.

149
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,572
Yeah, it looks like a lot of fun. The shot where
the Japanese Yakuza assassins were being fired

150
00:13:53,612 --> 00:13:59,436
out of this giant like Gatling gun onto Gotham
City. Right. It was just so wacky. It's like

151
00:13:59,516 --> 00:14:03,358
nothing that we've ever seen before, right?
Yeah, the line by Commissioner Gordon though

152
00:14:03,378 --> 00:14:07,942
was weird where he was like, yeah, it's raining
men. I was like, is that a reference to the

153
00:14:08,002 --> 00:14:13,706
song, It's Raining Men? I don't think so. I
do have to say though, this trailer definitely

154
00:14:13,726 --> 00:14:19,089
has turned me off to the dubbed version of this
movie. The way they released this trailer,

155
00:14:19,518 --> 00:14:24,919
was they showed you the dubbed version and then
right after that it was the subtitled version.

156
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:29,740
Just like with the first film, I imagine I'm
absolutely going to prefer the subtitled version

157
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:34,862
of this film just based on this trailer. Yeah,
the subbed version is the only version I've

158
00:14:34,902 --> 00:14:40,003
seen of the original Batman Ninja movie. The
film is coming out pretty soon here, March

159
00:14:40,103 --> 00:14:49,003
18th on digital and April 15th for the physical
versions. If you're a fan of the first I can't

160
00:14:49,063 --> 00:14:52,053
wait to watch it and I can't wait to review
it when it's released.

161
00:14:59,326 --> 00:15:02,909
I think that does it for all the news for this
episode so let's go ahead and move into our

162
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:08,254
main event Where we find out who would win in
a fight between darksight's team of generals

163
00:15:08,474 --> 00:15:12,497
the elite and Thanos's team of generals the
black order

164
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:34,651
All right, Darksides Elite versus The Black
Order. It's about to go down. I'm really excited

165
00:15:34,691 --> 00:15:39,795
for this matchup. Oh yeah, I think this idea
was given by our executive producer, Devin

166
00:15:39,835 --> 00:15:44,539
Davis, who comes up with fantastic ideas. And
once I heard this one, I was like, oh, hell

167
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:49,123
yeah. Yeah, I'm a big fan of The Black Order.
I think they were the coolest thing to come

168
00:15:49,163 --> 00:15:54,447
out of Jonathan Hickman's Infinity. And I thought
they were adapted really well in Avengers Infinity

169
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:59,912
War and Avengers Endgame. And... Even in video
games, there's the Marvel Ultimate Alliance

170
00:15:59,972 --> 00:16:05,937
3 video game in which they're the primary antagonists
and it's a whole lot of fun. So I have a real

171
00:16:05,997 --> 00:16:10,901
soft spot in my heart for this team. I think
largely because they're just so brutal and

172
00:16:10,921 --> 00:16:15,865
the character designs are so well done. Yeah.
And not only did we get to see members of Darkseid's

173
00:16:15,945 --> 00:16:21,570
elite in Zack Snyder's Justice League, but if
you grew up watching any form of DC animation,

174
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:26,113
you're pretty familiar with characters like
Granny Goodness and Da'sad and Steppenwolf.

175
00:16:26,326 --> 00:16:31,968
the latter of whom was actually the main antagonist
for the Justice League film. In addition to

176
00:16:32,028 --> 00:16:36,490
just like really liking the characters, the
primary reason I was pumped to do this episode

177
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:43,693
is because Marvel needs payback for what happened
back in 2018 when Thanos lost to Darkseid in

178
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:48,595
that duel episode. Spoiler alert! I've never
forgotten that and today's the day I make the

179
00:16:48,615 --> 00:16:54,637
world right again. We'll see. I'm actually really
curious to see how this match is gonna go and

180
00:16:54,657 --> 00:16:59,311
who's gonna win. It's exciting. But to explain
the methodology behind our duels, let's go

181
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:04,372
to our sentient Duel simulator, Alfred Jarvis
9000. AJ and IK tell our listeners how you

182
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:10,034
go about determining a winner in our Duel matchups.
Yes, of course, sir. The way I determine a

183
00:17:10,054 --> 00:17:15,075
winner between the two teams is by running 1000
Monte Carlo simulations between every character

184
00:17:15,115 --> 00:17:20,497
on each team using their statistics. A Monte
Carlo simulation is a probabilistic model used

185
00:17:20,537 --> 00:17:25,695
to determine outcomes through random sampling.
In this case, I randomize the statistics along

186
00:17:25,715 --> 00:17:30,339
a normal distribution as a way to simulate the
many variables that can occur during battle.

187
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:35,362
The stat parameters are based on the official
Marvel power grid, from which the DC characters'

188
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:40,586
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat
categories are included such as range, damage

189
00:17:40,606 --> 00:17:46,149
potential, versatility, and perception, in order
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.

190
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:51,353
The results of the 49,000 simulations provide
a percentage of wins for each character on

191
00:17:51,393 --> 00:17:55,951
both teams. The team with the higher average
win rate is declared the victor as they have

192
00:17:55,971 --> 00:18:00,773
a higher probability to win any given battle.
In an equitable pairing, neither team should

193
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:05,615
win 100% of the matches. The comic book stories
have shown that there's even a way for Batman

194
00:18:05,655 --> 00:18:10,017
to defeat Superman, so the confidence rate of
my method falls in line with the precedents

195
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:15,159
that have been established in the source material.
My mathematical simulations are without subjectivity

196
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:20,681
or bias. Feats are not the sole consideration,
nor are fan votes tabulated for determination

197
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:26,191
of the winner. Thanks, AgenonK! Before we run
the simulations though, we like to break down

198
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:32,855
each team's rosters and histories before improvising
a scenario on how we imagine one of the many

199
00:18:32,915 --> 00:18:37,678
simulations would play out beat for beat. And
I believe it's my turn to go first with the

200
00:18:37,818 --> 00:18:42,520
Marvel backstory, so let me go ahead and tell
you guys all about the Black Order. Thanos'

201
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:47,363
Black Order is an elite strike force assembled
to enforce his will and conquer planets in

202
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:52,422
his name. Composed of some of the most ruthless
and powerful warriors in the universe, The

203
00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:57,823
origins of the Black Order trace back to Thanos'
need for a force capable of executing his will

204
00:18:58,163 --> 00:19:03,185
with absolute efficiency. As detailed in his
backstory in the duel episode against Darkseid,

205
00:19:03,605 --> 00:19:10,207
Thanos had long commanded vast armies of marauders
and warlords, but recognized that brute force

206
00:19:10,247 --> 00:19:15,588
alone would not always guarantee victory. He
needed specialists, warriors who could execute

207
00:19:15,608 --> 00:19:20,766
missions with a level of cruelty beyond that
of common soldiers. Unlike the armies of the

208
00:19:20,806 --> 00:19:26,650
Chitauri and the Outriders that Thanos deployed
en masse, the Black Order functioned as a special

209
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:32,574
unit who could not only fight but also manipulate,
infiltrate, and dominate entire civilizations.

210
00:19:33,055 --> 00:19:37,838
Corvus Glaive was the first member to rise to
the challenge. A brilliant strategist and one

211
00:19:37,858 --> 00:19:42,761
of the most vicious warriors in the cosmos,
Corvus was granted his namesake weapon by Thanos.

212
00:19:43,342 --> 00:19:48,364
The glaive was sharp enough to split atoms and
cut through any substance, including the skin

213
00:19:48,764 --> 00:19:53,887
of immensely powerful beings like the Hulk and
Hyperion. More than just a tool of destruction,

214
00:19:54,287 --> 00:20:00,089
the glaive gave Corvus practical immortality.
So long as the blade remained intact, he could

215
00:20:00,129 --> 00:20:05,652
not die. His loyalty to Thanos was absolute,
and he proved to be the Mad Titan's most trusted

216
00:20:05,712 --> 00:20:12,235
general, leading Thanos' armies in battle. Corvus
Glaive's wife, Proxima Midnight, was the deadliest

217
00:20:13,136 --> 00:20:18,159
Black Order. Her mastery of hand-to-hand combat
was unparalleled, and her superhuman strength,

218
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:23,402
speed, and durability made her a match for even
the most powerful warriors. Her primary weapon

219
00:20:23,462 --> 00:20:29,426
was a spear forged from a collapsed star, capable
of wielding all the equivalent mass and energy.

220
00:20:30,147 --> 00:20:34,990
It functions as a homing projectile when thrown,
can fire energy blasts, and can immobilize

221
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:39,413
opponents with a black energy net. The lethal
toxin in its tip could

222
00:20:43,096 --> 00:20:48,499
in existence. Proxima thrived in battle, eager
to prove herself superior to any enemy who

223
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:53,642
dared oppose her. While Glaive and Midnight
were instruments of raw power, Ebony Maw was

224
00:20:53,682 --> 00:20:58,805
something else entirely. He was a manipulator,
a whisperer capable of unraveling even the

225
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:04,249
strongest minds. His voice was his greatest
weapon, enabling him to override the will of

226
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:09,332
others and turn them into pawns. In addition
to Ebony's persuasive abilities, he possessed

227
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:15,135
telekinesis, teleportation, and and could conjure
fireballs with his hands, further solidifying

228
00:21:15,175 --> 00:21:20,698
his position as one of Thanos' most insidious
agents. Black Dwarf, the team's brute force,

229
00:21:20,938 --> 00:21:25,760
possessed unparalleled strength and durability.
His unbreakable skin allowed him to withstand

230
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,582
the attacks of some of the most powerful beings
in the universe. His preferred weapons were

231
00:21:30,602 --> 00:21:35,765
massive bladed and blunt instruments which he
wielded with devastating force, most commonly

232
00:21:36,165 --> 00:21:37,846
a giant double-bladed axe.

233
00:21:42,028 --> 00:21:48,232
was a telepathic parasite capable of mind control
and mental consumption. Unlike Ebony Maw, who

234
00:21:48,272 --> 00:21:54,016
manipulated minds through persuasion, Supergiant
forcibly dominated her victims, feeding on

235
00:21:54,036 --> 00:21:58,439
their intellect. She could seize mental control
of entire armies, turning them against their

236
00:21:58,499 --> 00:22:03,562
allies. The Black Order's first major recorded
mission was against Ego the Living Planet,

237
00:22:03,943 --> 00:22:08,285
whom Thanos viewed as an offense to death, and
whom you can learn more about in his duel against

238
00:22:08,365 --> 00:22:08,466
the

239
00:22:11,568 --> 00:22:16,011
in battle, but the confrontation ended in a
stalemate. The Black Order's most infamous

240
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:21,454
campaign came during Thanos' attack on Earth.
With the Avengers occupied in deep space, Thanos

241
00:22:21,494 --> 00:22:26,938
launched a full-scale invasion, using his elite
warriors to target strategic locations. His

242
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:31,921
stated demand was a tribute, that each ruler
of Earth was to offer the heads of all younglings

243
00:22:31,961 --> 00:22:38,606
between the ages of 16 and 22. In reality, this
was a cover for his true goal, finding his

244
00:22:38,646 --> 00:22:45,670
lost son, Thane. order was assigned to region
of Earth to subjugate. Corvus Glaive and Supergiant

245
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:50,913
attacked the X Mansion seeking information on
Thane's location. Proxima Midnight was sent

246
00:22:50,933 --> 00:22:56,836
to Atlantis where she confronted Namor the Sub-Mariner.
Black Dwarf was assigned to Wakanda where he

247
00:22:56,876 --> 00:23:01,278
encountered the greatest resistance from forces
led by the Black Panther, who repelled his

248
00:23:01,318 --> 00:23:06,801
invasion and forced Black Dwarf to retreat in
disgrace. For this failure, Thanos expelled

249
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:12,226
him from the Black Order. Ebony Maw took a more
insidious approach. He infiltrated Doctor Strange's

250
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:17,373
mind, taking control of the Sorcerer Supreme
and using him as an agent to uncover Thane's

251
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:23,160
whereabouts. Eventually Ebony Maw located Thane
as a young man in the hidden inhuman town in

252
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:29,220
Greenland. There he discovered that Thane had
not yet undergone pterigenesis, which is an

253
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,923
evolutionary process that you can learn more
about in our Shazam versus Black Bolt duel

254
00:23:33,963 --> 00:23:39,646
episode. When Black Bolt detonated a pterigen
bomb over Earth, Thane's transformation was

255
00:23:39,686 --> 00:23:45,530
triggered, awakening his devastating abilities.
His left hand became a weapon of instant death,

256
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:50,353
while his right hand could encase victims in
a solid amber-like construct that left them

257
00:23:50,453 --> 00:23:57,404
in suspended animation. In an instant, he inadvertently
wiped out his entire town. Ebony Maw arrived,

258
00:23:57,544 --> 00:24:02,586
offering Thane a containment suit to control
his abilities, but the offer was a deception.

259
00:24:02,967 --> 00:24:07,889
Maw encased Thane in a force field and alerted
Thanos to his location. However, when Thanos

260
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:13,852
arrived to kill his son, Ebony Maw chose to
test Thane's potential. He freed him, giving

261
00:24:13,892 --> 00:24:20,155
him a choice, flee or embrace his heritage.
Thane chose the latter using his newfound power.

262
00:24:22,376 --> 00:24:27,699
midnight in amber, leaving them in a state of
living death. With Thanos defeated, the Black

263
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:32,082
Order fractured. Corvus Glaive remained with
his master while the others scattered, but

264
00:24:32,102 --> 00:24:36,625
their time apart was brief. The cosmic being
known as the Challenger reunited the Black

265
00:24:36,705 --> 00:24:41,689
Order, using them in a grand contest against
the Grandmaster's Lethal Legion. During the

266
00:24:41,709 --> 00:24:46,212
first round of the contest, the Black Order
fought the Lethal Legion for control of Pyramoids,

267
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:53,116
which were powerful cosmic artifacts placed
around the earth. Black Dwarf to secure the

268
00:24:53,196 --> 00:24:58,239
first Pyramoid in Rome. In the second round,
the Black Order moved to Antarctica, again

269
00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:02,861
clashing with the Avengers, who forced them
to retreat and ultimately brought the contest

270
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:07,823
to an end. Following the contest, the Black
Order regrouped to the planet Angargel, where

271
00:25:07,843 --> 00:25:12,766
they were tasked by an alien resistance with
dismantling the alien galactic empire. The

272
00:25:12,786 --> 00:25:18,149
Black Order only accepted as a means to seize
the bow of Gabriel, which was a weapon capable

273
00:25:18,189 --> 00:25:23,459
of planetary destruction. Ebony Maw manipulated
the Emperor into lowering the planet's defenses,

274
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:28,982
allowing the Black Order to take the weapon.
Corvus Glaive then activated the bow, transforming

275
00:25:29,022 --> 00:25:33,904
Sinar's inhabitants into monsters that destroyed
the planet and dismantled their galactic empire.

276
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:40,147
However, when their task was complete, the Grandmaster
arrived and seized the weapon from them. Later,

277
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:44,889
the Black Order served Hela, the Goddess of
Death, who sought to retrieve and resurrect

278
00:25:45,009 --> 00:25:49,551
Thanos. Together, they attacked Starfox and
the Guardians of the Galaxy to retrieve the

279
00:25:49,571 --> 00:25:54,475
body and bring bringing the Mad Titan back to
life on planet Nowhere. Though they were successful

280
00:25:54,515 --> 00:25:59,078
in restoring their leader, Thanos, Hela, and
the Black Order were scattered after being

281
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:03,060
sucked into a black hole that destroyed the
planet. You can learn more about the Guardians

282
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:08,224
of the Galaxy in their Team Duel episode against
the Doom Patrol. Most recently, the Black Order

283
00:26:08,244 --> 00:26:12,867
was tasked by the Intergalactic Council, led
by Thanos and assigned with addressing matters

284
00:26:12,907 --> 00:26:17,730
of universal importance to assist the Imperial
Guard in stopping the threat of the Phoenix

285
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:25,054
Force. entity in our Raven versus Phoenix duel
episode and that's the Black Order's history.

286
00:26:25,074 --> 00:26:30,697
For this team duel the seven-member roster was
mostly easy to come by. Of course it will be

287
00:26:30,777 --> 00:26:36,360
led by Thanos the Mad Titan with his immense
strength and durability, cosmic energies, matter

288
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:41,854
manipulation, vast intelligence, and incalculable
evil. The original members are also on the

289
00:26:41,894 --> 00:26:47,378
roster, including Corvus Glaive with his Adam-splitting
blade, enhanced physicals, and strategic mind.

290
00:26:47,778 --> 00:26:53,842
Next is Proxima Midnight, wielder of her star-powered
spear, enhanced physicals, and combat mastery.

291
00:26:54,342 --> 00:27:00,326
Also on the team is Ebony Maw with his persuasive
voice, telekinesis, fireball generation, and

292
00:27:00,426 --> 00:27:06,409
genius intellect. Then we have Black Dwarf,
who I'm gonna call Cull Obsidian for this match.

293
00:27:07,062 --> 00:27:12,344
I'm taking a cue from the movies and the video
games and acknowledge that the name Black Dwarf

294
00:27:12,644 --> 00:27:18,026
is a horrible name for a brutish alien warrior.
And I already know that one of the nicknames

295
00:27:18,066 --> 00:27:23,189
for the Black Order itself in the comics was
the Kull Obsidian, so it can get confusing,

296
00:27:23,429 --> 00:27:29,852
but for this match, Black Dwarf shall henceforth
be known as Kull Obsidian. He wields a giant

297
00:27:29,872 --> 00:27:35,690
double-bladed axe, has vast strength and durability
with unbreakable skin. Rounding out the original

298
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:40,832
team is Supergiant, who never made an appearance
in the MCU, but she's the team resident telepath

299
00:27:41,212 --> 00:27:46,235
who can mentally possess entire legions and
psychically devour their minds. For the seventh

300
00:27:46,355 --> 00:27:51,137
and final member of the team, I was thinking
of going with Black Swan, who was a recurring

301
00:27:51,217 --> 00:27:55,999
member of the Black Order, but I found her power
set to be too vague, with like, some energy

302
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:01,361
manipulation, some telepathy, some strength.
Instead I decided to go with Thanos' son himself,

303
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:05,626
Thane. who has never actually been a member
of the Black Order in the comics, but he has

304
00:28:05,646 --> 00:28:10,868
been heavily involved with them, and he aligned
himself with Ebony Maw in the books, and he

305
00:28:11,048 --> 00:28:16,029
allied with the whole team in the video game
Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3, wherein Thane is

306
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:21,571
actually the final villain. Plus his power set
of having essentially an Omega effect touch

307
00:28:21,591 --> 00:28:26,032
with one arm, and an Amber Energy construct
generation effect with the other arm is pretty

308
00:28:26,052 --> 00:28:33,630
cool. So that's my team. Thanos, Corvus Glaive,
Proxima Midnight. Ebony Maw, Cull Obsidian,

309
00:28:34,191 --> 00:28:40,413
Supergiant, and Thane. Yeah, Cull Obsidian is
a way better name than Black Dwarf. I do have

310
00:28:40,433 --> 00:28:45,375
to say though, Supergiant is super confusing
considering what the character looks like.

311
00:28:45,395 --> 00:28:50,598
I was thrown for a loop with that one. Yeah,
I mean, she's not a giant, right? She's a telepath,

312
00:28:50,918 --> 00:28:56,240
a psychic vampire. Real weird. DC doesn't have
that problem. I'm pretty sure that some of

313
00:28:56,260 --> 00:29:01,014
the names of Darkseid's elite are pretty stupid
too, like Granny Goodness. Hell yeah. The fuck

314
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:06,735
is that? Terrifying is what it is. Nothing more
sinister than grandma's goodies. Wait, what?

315
00:29:06,855 --> 00:29:12,757
What the fuck did you just say? Well, let's
erase that from our minds by moving on to the

316
00:29:12,797 --> 00:29:20,299
backstory of Darkseid's elite, whose history
is closely tied to Darkseid himself. Actually

317
00:29:20,339 --> 00:29:25,241
had a really hard time trying to separate the
history of the team from its leader. It was

318
00:29:25,301 --> 00:29:30,211
not possible. So there's a lot of reach right
here. Just bear with me. Now Apocalypse, a

319
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:36,176
desolate world of fire and suffering, was forged
from the remnants of a dead pantheon. When

320
00:29:36,196 --> 00:29:42,561
the Old Gods waged war in a catastrophic conflict
known as Ragnarok, their homeworld was torn

321
00:29:42,621 --> 00:29:49,628
asunder, and from its ruins emerged two new
planets. New Genesis, a utopian paradise under

322
00:29:49,648 --> 00:29:55,413
the guidance of Highfather, and Apocalypse,
a burning wasteland where only the ruthless

323
00:29:55,453 --> 00:30:00,496
had survived. For centuries, Apocalypse was
ruled by Deathspots, who sought nothing but

324
00:30:00,556 --> 00:30:07,079
war and suffering, but none were as cruel or
ambitious as Darkseid, who seized power through

325
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:13,062
betrayal, orchestrating the deaths of his own
mother, Queen Hegra, and his pacifist brother

326
00:30:13,202 --> 00:30:20,266
Drax. As the new god of tyranny, Darkseid reshaped
Apocalypse into a world of oppression and forced

327
00:30:20,326 --> 00:30:27,130
obedience, powered by its fire pits which fed
on the very essence of its suffering To enforce

328
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:33,916
his iron rule, Darkseid assembled his elite,
a collection of generals, assassins, torturers,

329
00:30:34,016 --> 00:30:39,700
and warlords, whose authority was second only
to his own. Together, Darkseid's elite carried

330
00:30:39,741 --> 00:30:45,806
out their master's will across the cosmos, ensuring
that no world defied him and the apocalypse

331
00:30:46,106 --> 00:30:52,351
remained the ultimate monument to his dominion.
As Darkseid consolidated his rule over apocalypse,

332
00:30:52,691 --> 00:30:58,672
he turned his attention toward universal domination.
provoking war with New Genesis and other worlds.

333
00:30:59,112 --> 00:31:04,656
His uncle, Steppenwolf, led the first major
assault, hunting the new gods of New Genesis

334
00:31:04,676 --> 00:31:12,001
for sport and killing Avia, the wife of High
Father Izaya. This act ignited a long and brutal

335
00:31:12,041 --> 00:31:17,044
war between the two planets with Darkseid's
forces locked in an eternal struggle against

336
00:31:17,104 --> 00:31:22,288
their celestial counterparts. When the seemingly
endless war between Apocalypse and New Genesis

337
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:28,587
raged toward an unavoidable stalemate, Darkseid
and Highfather struck a temporary truce known

338
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:34,610
as the Pact, exchanging their newborn sons.
Orion was sent to New Genesis, while Scott

339
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:40,233
Free, aka Mr. Miracle, was raised in Granny
Goodness's orphanage. You can learn more about

340
00:31:40,314 --> 00:31:45,576
Orion and Mr. Miracle in their respective duels
against the Silver Surfer and Adam Warlock.

341
00:31:45,897 --> 00:31:51,279
Darkseid's truce did little to halt his ambitions,
however, and when Scott Free eventually escaped

342
00:31:51,339 --> 00:31:59,184
Apocalypse and fled to Earth, as both a battleground
and a testing ground for his greater plans,

343
00:31:59,464 --> 00:32:05,807
as he believed Earth held fragments of the anti-life
equation within the minds of his people. His

344
00:32:05,847 --> 00:32:12,931
forces, led by Glorious Godfrey, infiltrated
human society, using the media and mass manipulation

345
00:32:12,971 --> 00:32:19,295
to turn the population against their own protectors.
Godfrey's words nearly succeeded in suing the

346
00:32:19,335 --> 00:32:25,078
people of Earth, but he was ultimately defeated
by Earth's heroes. At the same time, Darkseid's

347
00:32:25,118 --> 00:32:30,879
scientists, including Desaad and Dr. Bedlam,
experimented with new methods of psychological

348
00:32:30,939 --> 00:32:37,161
warfare. Bedlam introduced the Paranoid Pill,
a substance capable of inducing mass hysteria,

349
00:32:37,481 --> 00:32:42,803
while Desaad's torturous experiments produced
technological monstrosities to enforce Darkseid's

350
00:32:42,843 --> 00:32:49,324
rule. Granny Goodness, the overseer of Apocalypse's
orphanages, trained warriors to serve in Darkseid's

351
00:32:49,464 --> 00:32:55,346
armies, conditioning them into mindless soldiers
devoted to his cause. Over the years, Darkseid

352
00:32:55,366 --> 00:33:00,609
clashed with Earth's heroes, particularly Superman,
whose power made him one of the few beings

353
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:06,791
capable of challenging his tyranny and might.
Timing again, Darkseid's elite led invasions

354
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:12,474
of Earth, attempting to bring the planet under
apocalyptic rule. Darkseid's armies of parademons,

355
00:33:12,714 --> 00:33:17,956
commanded by Steppenwolf and Darkseid's son,
Kelebek, descended upon Earth only to be repelled

356
00:33:18,236 --> 00:33:22,318
by the combined might of the Justice League.
which you can learn more about in the team

357
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:27,702
duel Justice League vs Avengers. Darkseid's
obsession with the Anti-Life Equation remained

358
00:33:27,742 --> 00:33:33,566
his driving goal, leading to numerous conflicts
with Earth's greatest minds and heroes. He

359
00:33:33,626 --> 00:33:38,770
sought to uncover its secrets through direct
assaults, cosmic manipulations, and alliances

360
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:44,754
with other dark forces. Apocalypse was briefly
abandoned when Darkseid and his people were

361
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:50,842
slain by an unknown force, the Infinity Man
acting on behalf of the Source. The New God

362
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:56,727
Spirits fell to Earth where they were reborn
in mortal bodies. Darkseid took on the identity

363
00:33:57,007 --> 00:34:02,411
of Boss Darkseid, spreading corruption from
the shadows while plotting the resurrection

364
00:34:02,492 --> 00:34:08,196
of his true form, which he eventually obtained
along with the completed anti-life equation.

365
00:34:08,697 --> 00:34:14,121
As every living being within the universe became
transformed into Darkseid's mindless slaves,

366
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:23,940
reality itself began falling apart. a Radion
bullet before seemingly dying himself to Darkseid's

367
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:30,804
Omega-sanctioned power. When a Flashpoint event
reset DC's continuity, Darkseid and his elite

368
00:34:30,864 --> 00:34:36,707
returned, though Darkseid's new war was not
against New Genesis nor against Earth, which

369
00:34:36,747 --> 00:34:42,810
he had already failed to conquer, but against
a rival god, the Anti-Monitor, an embodiment

370
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:48,953
of antimatter and destruction. The Anti-Monitor,
once the greatest threat to the multiverse,

371
00:34:49,194 --> 00:34:54,855
had been transformed by the corrupted Amazon
named Grail, Darkseid's own secret daughter.

372
00:34:55,255 --> 00:35:00,817
The battle between Darkseid and the Anti-Monitor
played out across multiple worlds, culminating

373
00:35:01,137 --> 00:35:07,558
in a direct confrontation on Earth. Darkseid,
wielding his Omega Effect, attempted to destroy

374
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:13,260
his rival, but the Anti-Monitor had evolved,
now wielding the Anti-Life Equation itself.

375
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:19,518
At the height of battle, the Anti-Monitor turned
the Anti-Life Equation upon Darkseid Unmaking

376
00:35:19,558 --> 00:35:26,341
Kim completely. With Darkseid's death, Apocalypse
fell into chaos. Calleback, Steppenwolf, and

377
00:35:26,381 --> 00:35:32,603
Grail all fought for control, but the most shocking
development came when Grail resurrected Darkseid,

378
00:35:32,823 --> 00:35:39,586
not as a god, but as an infant. For a time,
Apocalypse had no true ruler, as Grail raised

379
00:35:39,626 --> 00:35:45,609
the child Darkseid, sacrificing old gods to
feed his power. Over time, Darkseid grew into

380
00:35:45,629 --> 00:35:51,934
an adult once more. eventually killing Zeus
himself to reclaim his godhood. But Darkseid

381
00:35:51,954 --> 00:35:58,079
was no longer content with mere conquest. He
sought to harness the Great Darkness, the primordial

382
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:04,524
force from before creation. However, Darkseid
soon discovered that he was not its master,

383
00:36:04,824 --> 00:36:10,849
he was its pawn. The Great Darkness consumed
him, turning Darkseid and his elite into servants

384
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:17,159
of an even greater force. Now, under the control
of the Darkness itself, Darkseid led a final

385
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:22,523
invasion of Earth, seeking to eliminate its
heroes once and for all. Though he was eventually

386
00:36:22,603 --> 00:36:29,108
freed from the darkness' control, Darkseid disappeared
into its void, leaving Apocalypse once again

387
00:36:29,449 --> 00:36:35,534
without its ruler. With Darkseid gone, Apocalypse
remained a world on the edge of collapse, its

388
00:36:35,574 --> 00:36:45,098
elite vying for power, waiting for the inevitable
return of their god. For Darkseid is. I've

389
00:36:45,118 --> 00:36:50,239
selected the most prominent figures within Darkseid's
elite, each of whom play a critical role in

390
00:36:50,299 --> 00:36:56,161
Darkseid's Universal Conquest. Of course there's
Darkseid himself, ruler of Apocalypse, but

391
00:36:56,261 --> 00:37:02,962
also his right-hand man Desaad, Darkseid's chief
torturer and scientist responsible for developing

392
00:37:03,043 --> 00:37:08,344
advanced weaponry and psychological warfare.
I'm also including Granny Goodness, the ruthless

393
00:37:08,364 --> 00:37:15,026
commander of Apocalypse's orphanages, and Darkseid's
personal guard, the Female Furies. Also, Darkseid's

394
00:37:15,086 --> 00:37:21,772
uncle Steppenwolf, Apocalypse's seasoned general
and tactician, and Kanto, the planet's master

395
00:37:21,812 --> 00:37:28,377
assassin. Darkseid's brutish, firstborn son,
Calleback, will bring added brawn to this fight,

396
00:37:28,457 --> 00:37:36,104
while Dr. Bedlam brings added brains as a psionic
entity. So to recap, it's Darkseid, Desaad,

397
00:37:36,464 --> 00:37:43,906
Granny Goodness, Steppenwolf, Kanto, Calleback,
and Dr. Bedlam on this team. I like that team.

398
00:37:44,086 --> 00:37:48,990
That's a pretty good team. I think there's good
analogs between them and the Black Order, especially

399
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:55,395
when you pair Supergiant with Dr. Bedlam. And
I think you could pair Thane with Kanto. And

400
00:37:55,435 --> 00:38:00,839
Kalebak with Cull Obsidian, and especially Desaad
vs Ebony Maw. I think that's the pairing that

401
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:06,183
works the best. There's also Steppenwolf against
Corvus Glaive and Proxima Midnight with Granny

402
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:09,625
Goodness. It's fate. It's fate how good these
pairings match up.

410
00:39:03,754 --> 00:39:07,675
Now that we got their histories and rosters
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

411
00:39:07,695 --> 00:39:13,356
of the many simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not our speculation,

412
00:39:13,836 --> 00:39:19,878
but it's fun to imagine how this team duel could
play out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?

413
00:39:20,738 --> 00:39:24,819
Well, I should say there are no rules other
than the teams have no prior knowledge of the

414
00:39:24,919 --> 00:39:29,621
other going into the fight. All they are aware
of starting out is that the other side is a

415
00:39:29,681 --> 00:39:34,622
threat that needs to be eliminated. For the
speculation, Groups will begin approximately

416
00:39:34,682 --> 00:39:39,385
50 meters apart in a nondescript environment
that will have no bearing on the match itself,

417
00:39:39,826 --> 00:39:44,769
as no environmental statistics are considered
in my simulations. The teams must earn victory

418
00:39:44,789 --> 00:39:49,412
on their own merit. All right, then let's get
into it. Darkseid's elite and the Black Order

419
00:39:49,532 --> 00:39:55,816
meet on the battlefield. Who goes first? I'm
gonna say Darkseid starts off with his Omega

420
00:39:55,836 --> 00:40:02,333
Beams, of course. What? So right away. Two red
energy beams shoot out from his eyes, zigzagging

421
00:40:02,373 --> 00:40:07,737
across the arena and passing through each member
of the Black Order, just disintegrating them.

422
00:40:08,258 --> 00:40:15,084
Match over! You cheating ass bastard. What happened
to escalation during these speculations, right?

423
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:21,209
I'm gonna say that the Omega beams approach
Corvus Glaive first, and he's gonna defend

424
00:40:21,249 --> 00:40:26,373
himself with his glaive, which is sharp enough,
as I said, to cut through anything, even atoms.

425
00:40:27,054 --> 00:40:32,216
And yeah, they could even cut through energy
like these Omega beams. What the blade is going

426
00:40:32,236 --> 00:40:37,738
to cut through Darkseid's beams and split them.
And they go off course and miss their mark.

427
00:40:37,758 --> 00:40:45,381
Dude, the Omega beams do not miss. But even
if the Omega beams can be cut by Corvus's blade,

428
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:50,723
someone still dies because one of the split
beams is just going to make a return zigzag

429
00:40:50,763 --> 00:40:57,586
trip and blast. I don't know, the psychic chick
super giant. So she's out of the man. The Omega

430
00:40:57,626 --> 00:41:02,508
beams suck, okay? They're a cheap ass attack.
Thanos is not gonna have any part of that shit

431
00:41:02,588 --> 00:41:09,011
So he raises his fist and each member of Darksides
Elite are gonna raise into the air with this

432
00:41:09,071 --> 00:41:15,173
blue Energy aura around them due to Thanos's
telekinesis, right? He's lifting him telekinetically

433
00:41:15,493 --> 00:41:20,515
and then Thanos is gonna slam Darksides Elite
down with a force. That's so hard It's gonna

434
00:41:20,576 --> 00:41:25,157
crack the planet that they're on. So now they're
all fighting in like this Grand Canyon. Okay

435
00:41:25,522 --> 00:41:32,126
I mean, Thanos lifts and slams everyone he can
see, which is not Kanto, who happens to be

436
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:38,991
Darkseid's expert assassin and a master of stealth.
So despite the planet cracking, Kanto delivers

437
00:41:39,051 --> 00:41:46,396
this surprise attack with his apocalyptic sword
and slashes Thanos fist right off. And he follows

438
00:41:46,436 --> 00:41:52,201
up with a series of rapid slashes right across
Thanos chest. Oh, shit. He fucked up there

439
00:41:52,221 --> 00:41:56,916
because Cull Obsidian. is not cool with his
boss's hands just getting chopped off, okay?

440
00:41:57,456 --> 00:42:03,780
So he leaps over to Kanto, and with a mighty
swing of his giant battle axe, he chops off

441
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:09,364
Kanto's head with just one whack, and that thing
goes flying. Kanto's out of the match now,

442
00:42:10,045 --> 00:42:14,428
and Thanos, you know, he'll be fine. He's gonna
heal those chest slashes real quick. Okay,

443
00:42:14,528 --> 00:42:20,772
well, meanwhile, Dr. Bedlam, who's this, you
know, invisible, psychic energy being, is currently

444
00:42:20,832 --> 00:42:26,953
controlling six different androids. known as
Animants, and they're all curb-stopping Thane

445
00:42:26,993 --> 00:42:32,237
right now, just pummeling him to death. No,
no, no. Because Proxima Midnight sees Thane

446
00:42:32,277 --> 00:42:37,462
being attacked, and before the androids can
kill Thane, she hurls her sun-powered spear

447
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:43,827
toward them, and as the spear flies, it's gonna
emanate the solar flare energy that arcs out

448
00:42:44,047 --> 00:42:49,212
and strikes the entire android group, just frying
their circuits. And then the spear's gonna

449
00:42:49,272 --> 00:42:55,872
lodge into the real Dr. Bedlam. impaling him
into the canyon wall that they're in and taking

450
00:42:55,893 --> 00:43:01,216
him out of this match. Well there is no like
real Dr. Bedlam, he just imparts his form on

451
00:43:01,436 --> 00:43:06,900
one anime specifically, but sure we'll say that
was the one that got impaled. But yeah now

452
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,604
Proxima Mindaig is without her weapon right
so Granny Goodness is gonna take advantage

453
00:43:12,644 --> 00:43:18,588
of her disarmament and blast a hole right through
her torso with a beam from her apocalyptic

454
00:43:18,608 --> 00:43:28,083
staff so Proxima's out. Okay. Oh, suddenly Granny
Goodness gets her whole head bashed in by Calaback,

455
00:43:28,403 --> 00:43:35,365
Darkseid's son himself, and her own teammate.
What? Because as the battle was going on, Ebony

456
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:40,787
Ma weaseled his way over to Calaback and whispered
into his ear, reminding him how much he hates

457
00:43:40,807 --> 00:43:46,048
that old bag and convinced him to play Whack-a-Mole
with her head. So Granny Goodness is now out

458
00:43:46,088 --> 00:43:50,249
of the match. You know, I actually believe that
he probably does hate her. Everyone hates her.

459
00:43:50,646 --> 00:43:54,528
But also that's elder abuse, by the way. Now,
while that's going on, Steppenwolf, you know,

460
00:43:54,588 --> 00:43:59,951
he noticed Kull Obsidian with his axe. And so
Steppenwolf is going to attack him with his

461
00:44:00,091 --> 00:44:06,574
own powerful electro axe, starting by slamming
it into the ground near Kull, which is going

462
00:44:06,594 --> 00:44:11,597
to cause the shockwave that knocks him into
the air. And Steppenwolf is going to follow

463
00:44:11,697 --> 00:44:18,461
up by hurling his axe like quick as lightning
right at Kull, just slicing him into midair.

464
00:44:19,862 --> 00:44:25,483
How sharp is Steppenwolf's axe? Cause Kull is
like really durable. It can literally cut through

465
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:31,825
any material. But can it cut through atoms?
Sure, why the fuck not? You are a liar, sir.

466
00:44:31,845 --> 00:44:38,727
Okay, but anyway, guess what? Super giant, she's
still on the battlefield. She's such a powerful

467
00:44:38,847 --> 00:44:44,728
omnipath that even if her body's destroyed,
she survives as a psionic spirit. So the only

468
00:44:44,768 --> 00:44:50,762
thing Dark Sight's Omega Beam did to her was
make her intangible. So like as this psionic

469
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:57,185
entity, she's gonna read the mind of Darkseid,
and therefore she learns the secret to the

470
00:44:57,265 --> 00:45:02,527
Omega effect, and she's gonna feed that information
to Thanos, who's all healed up by this point,

471
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:08,409
and Thanos is gonna augment his own cosmic powers
to mimic the energy wavelength of Darkseid's

472
00:45:08,449 --> 00:45:14,592
Omega Beams. So then, Thanos, straight up Omega
Beams, Steppenwolf, the fuck outta here. What

473
00:45:14,632 --> 00:45:22,624
the heck? That's right. Okay, well. Dr. Bedlam
has been floating around as a disembodied energy

474
00:45:22,664 --> 00:45:29,248
bank too, just like Supergiant. And since Desaad
was able to repair one of his android bodies

475
00:45:29,368 --> 00:45:35,091
during this battle, Bedlam is going to be able
to take control of that again, fully aware

476
00:45:35,491 --> 00:45:43,155
of what Supergiant did. So he's going to unleash
one of his paranoid pills on Thanos. And his

477
00:45:43,215 --> 00:45:50,047
fumes cause Thanos to not only blast Corvus
Glaive into oblivion, but also the stress causes

478
00:45:50,107 --> 00:45:57,231
Thanos to forget how to use the Omega effect.
Well that's convenient. If Dr. Bedlam is aware

479
00:45:57,311 --> 00:46:03,414
of Supergiant, she's going to be aware of him,
and she's a psychic parasite, so she's going

480
00:46:03,434 --> 00:46:08,717
to latch onto him and devour his mind. So now
Dr. Bedlam is officially gone from this match

481
00:46:08,777 --> 00:46:15,341
now. Oh, well, Supergiant, you know, she seems
to know so much, she'll probably go for Darkseid's

482
00:46:15,401 --> 00:46:21,825
mind next, right? Since- He's the leader. Sure.
Except surprise, she's going to get tricked

483
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:28,191
by Dessahd's psychic manipulations into going
for his own mind, since he cast a mental illusion

484
00:46:28,231 --> 00:46:33,175
to disguise himself as Darkseid. And that's
something he does all the time in the comics.

485
00:46:33,735 --> 00:46:39,160
So Supergiant, instead of psychically attacking
Darkseid, she's going to get sucked into a

486
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:45,605
psychic torture device that Dessahd engineered.
And so her psionic form is going to get absorbed.

487
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:53,472
and converted into energy that Dasad weaponizes
against Ebony Maw. He's going to use that device

488
00:46:53,492 --> 00:47:00,334
to blast him with beams of energy. Wait, okay.
You lost me. So Dasad made a device that can

489
00:47:00,434 --> 00:47:06,215
somehow torture minds, but also convert them
into energy and then also blast them out as

490
00:47:06,235 --> 00:47:11,517
a weapon. Yes. That's pretty convenient, don't
you think? Oh, I'm sorry. Your feeble mind

491
00:47:11,557 --> 00:47:18,845
can't comprehend fourth world technology. stupid.
Ebony Maw is just going to teleport out of

492
00:47:18,865 --> 00:47:22,988
the way of Dessod's blast and then he's going
to counter with a volley of fireballs. Okay,

493
00:47:23,468 --> 00:47:29,854
except without realizing it, Ebony Maw teleported
in front of Kelebek, who, you know, remembers

494
00:47:29,874 --> 00:47:36,819
how Ebony manipulated him earlier and Kelebek
is going to straight up slam his club straight

495
00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:43,365
down onto Ebony from behind like a hammer to
a nail, just creating this Ebony smear on the

496
00:47:43,385 --> 00:47:52,478
ground beneath him. Alright, uh, well meanwhile
Thane approaches Desaud and he's gonna snatch

497
00:47:52,498 --> 00:47:57,881
him with his right hand which puts Desaud into
this amber energy construct which basically

498
00:47:58,061 --> 00:48:03,584
traps him forever in a state of living death
and now the only mind that Desaud can torture

499
00:48:03,644 --> 00:48:08,206
is his own for all eternity. And then Thane
approaches Kelebak and grabs him with his left

500
00:48:08,246 --> 00:48:13,349
hand which just instantly kills Kelebak. So
these guys got the old one-two combo here from

501
00:48:13,409 --> 00:48:19,485
Thane, you know, death. for Kalebeck and a fate
worse than death for Dasan. Okay, well speaking

502
00:48:19,805 --> 00:48:26,089
of living death, Thane is going to suddenly
be zapped by Darkseid's Omega Beams, which

503
00:48:26,170 --> 00:48:32,274
zigzagged their way behind him and delivered
Darkseid's Omega Sanction. So now Thane is

504
00:48:32,334 --> 00:48:39,779
trapped in an eternal and torturous cycle of
pain, death, and rebirth across alternate realities.

505
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:47,435
That's what the Omega Sanction does? Yeah. Well...
So it's just Thanos and Darkseid exactly how

506
00:48:47,515 --> 00:48:53,938
I wanted. Oh, me too pal, me too. Revenge is
gonna be so sweet because the paranoid pill

507
00:48:54,258 --> 00:48:59,480
that Bedlam used on Thanos that wears off by
this point and he remembers how to use this

508
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:07,004
omega sanction himself. So the turntables have
turned and Thanos puts Darkseid into this omega

509
00:49:07,044 --> 00:49:12,326
sanction and just relishes in the endless death
and defeat of his foe. So the match is over.

510
00:49:12,587 --> 00:49:19,012
Thanos beats Darkseid. If I could drop my podcast
mic, I would. Oh, you should. Like you should

511
00:49:19,192 --> 00:49:25,398
drop it and never pick it up again, because
you sound stupid. Darkseid would just generate

512
00:49:25,458 --> 00:49:31,723
a boom tube between him and Thanos, as well
as like a second portal behind Thanos. So Thanos

513
00:49:31,763 --> 00:49:37,909
is just going to omega sanction himself like
the purple bitch he is. Match over. Oh, shit,

514
00:49:37,949 --> 00:49:43,053
I think you forgot. that I mentioned that Corvus
Glaive can't die if his blade isn't destroyed.

515
00:49:43,093 --> 00:49:47,497
So while Darkseid thinks he just won the fight,
he's going to find himself straight up sliced

516
00:49:47,537 --> 00:49:54,242
in half by Corvus Glaive, who was resurrected
by his weapon. So now the match is over and

517
00:49:54,282 --> 00:50:00,748
the joke's on you. But why? I think the joke's
actually on you because Thanos did, in fact,

518
00:50:00,848 --> 00:50:05,512
destroy Corvus's blade when he killed him, you
know, under the influence of the paranoid pills.

519
00:50:05,592 --> 00:50:10,875
So sorry, but no. Well, we'll see what actually
happens. We'll go ahead and run the stats on

520
00:50:10,895 --> 00:50:16,998
these teams to find out who will win. And either
Corvus Glaive resurrects and slices Darkseid

521
00:50:17,038 --> 00:50:22,962
in two, or Corvus Glaive does not resurrect
because his weapon was destroyed. Right, it

522
00:50:22,982 --> 00:50:27,884
all comes down to whether Thanos destroyed Corvus'
weapon, which I'm sure he did. Let's go ahead

523
00:50:27,904 --> 00:50:34,668
and run the stats and come back with a winner.
Hey G9K, hit it. Inputting data, running calculations,

524
00:50:35,148 --> 00:50:41,296
processing results, simulations complete. All
right, that was a fun matchup, a really close

525
00:50:41,356 --> 00:50:45,940
matchup, surprisingly close after we put in
all the stats. Well, I mean, it wasn't too

526
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:52,585
surprising that Darkseid was the most powerful
on either of our rosters. Yeah, Darkseid ended

527
00:50:52,625 --> 00:50:59,911
up winning 89.1% of all of his matches, basically
nine out of 10 fights against the Black Order

528
00:50:59,951 --> 00:51:05,875
and Thanos. Darkseid won. He's a big ass cheater
character. I mean not by much because Thanos

529
00:51:05,955 --> 00:51:12,461
wasn't too far behind in his win rate, winning
87.1% of his matches. Yeah, they're definitely

530
00:51:12,481 --> 00:51:16,844
the most powerful characters on their respective
teams, just wiping the floor with the other

531
00:51:16,964 --> 00:51:21,108
respective generals. Now what I thought was
interesting was that while I had probably the

532
00:51:21,148 --> 00:51:26,872
more balanced team, on your side you had the
most powerful characters in Proxima, Midnight,

533
00:51:27,153 --> 00:51:32,357
and Supergiant, but also the weakest when it
came to Thane. Yeah, Thane actually wasn't

534
00:51:32,397 --> 00:51:37,975
impressive. Statistically at all which makes
me hope that I didn't choose incorrectly in

535
00:51:38,015 --> 00:51:44,458
picking him for this team duel because Yeah,
he has massive damage potential with the abilities

536
00:51:44,498 --> 00:51:50,120
of both of his arms And he has you know enhanced
physicals being an inhuman but other than that

537
00:51:50,521 --> 00:51:55,823
he's not too impressive Statistically compared
to the new gods, you know things like his evasiveness

538
00:51:56,183 --> 00:52:01,565
and perception just weren't that great Yeah,
he only won twenty point eight percent of his

539
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:06,056
matches He was kind of my wild card for this
team duel though. I don't know if I really

540
00:52:06,136 --> 00:52:10,939
had a wild card. I was kind of surprised that
my weakest character was Kanto. I thought it

541
00:52:10,959 --> 00:52:17,544
was going to be Dasad because I figured he was
the least warrior-esque of the group, but it

542
00:52:17,584 --> 00:52:23,969
turns out he's pretty smart and Kanto is pretty
unimpressive. Yeah, the guy just carries a

543
00:52:24,009 --> 00:52:28,812
sword and wears a ridiculous Renaissance fair
outfit. I gotta say, he definitely does not

544
00:52:28,892 --> 00:52:34,753
look like Darkseid's chief assassin. That's
exactly what he wants you to think. I think

545
00:52:34,793 --> 00:52:39,277
the biggest discrepancy between the team stats
was versatility. Marvel's guys were way more

546
00:52:39,297 --> 00:52:45,802
versatile than DC's guys. And durability, actually
DC's guys were way more durable overall than

547
00:52:45,842 --> 00:52:51,167
the Marvel team, largely because Darkseid's
durability is off the charts. And also they're

548
00:52:51,207 --> 00:52:58,413
all new gods, whereas the Black Order are a
pretty diverse group of aliens from across

549
00:52:58,453 --> 00:53:02,510
the universe. So I actually wasn't surprised
that they were more versatile. Considering

550
00:53:02,630 --> 00:53:07,292
all the results, all the stats, Jonathan, who's
winning this match? Do you think? I think it's

551
00:53:07,312 --> 00:53:13,173
going to be really close. I'm not sure who's
going to win, but I really hope it's Darksides

552
00:53:13,213 --> 00:53:18,615
Elite because I just really don't want him to
lose to Thanos. I hate Thanos. Dude sucks.

553
00:53:18,915 --> 00:53:26,657
And I think our poll takers on Instagram agree
because 64% of them voted in favor of Darksides

554
00:53:26,697 --> 00:53:34,700
Elite over the Black Order. The fools! AG9K,
the results please. Here you are, sir. Alright,

555
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:45,045
the winner in this team matchup between DarkSide's
Elite and the Black Order is... DarkSide's

556
00:53:45,125 --> 00:53:53,669
Elite. Yes! It was pretty close though. Out
of 1,000 matches, DarkSide's Elite beat the

557
00:53:53,709 --> 00:54:03,322
Black Order. 511 times. So their win rate was
51.1% over the Black Order's 48.9%. Yeah, they

558
00:54:03,342 --> 00:54:09,165
only won 489 out of the 1000 battles. Oh wow,
that's not pretty close. That's really close.

559
00:54:10,086 --> 00:54:16,389
I figured it would be, but it's still surprising.
Thanos just cannot beat Darkseid. What the

560
00:54:16,469 --> 00:54:21,932
fuck? What does he gotta do to beat this guy?
Nothing, he can't. There's nothing he could

561
00:54:21,972 --> 00:54:26,839
do. Just accept it already. Is he gonna have
to pull out his Infinity Gauntlet again? Like

562
00:54:26,859 --> 00:54:32,241
he did last time? Oh, does Darkseid need to
pull out his Anti-Life Equation? No, it's not

563
00:54:32,261 --> 00:54:35,462
gonna do anything to the Infinity Gauntlet.
It's gonna- I think we've already established

564
00:54:35,502 --> 00:54:41,705
this. Yes it is. It's gonna put Thanos with
his Infinity Gauntlet under the control of

565
00:54:41,805 --> 00:54:47,348
Darkseid. Why does this not make sense to you?
Because Thanos, when he has the Infinity Gauntlet,

566
00:54:47,828 --> 00:54:51,349
has the Mind Stone, which would protect him
from something like the Anti-Life Equation.

567
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:55,731
and he has the reality stone, which would also
do the same thing. Your point is, is there

568
00:54:55,871 --> 00:55:01,552
a life stone on the infinity gauntlet? Because
as long as Thanos is alive, he's under dark

569
00:55:01,592 --> 00:55:07,794
sides control when he has the anti life equation.
There's a soul stone. Oh, shit. So there you

570
00:55:07,814 --> 00:55:16,616
go. There you go. Thanos wins. Suck it, nerds.
Clearly, he doesn't. So you, you know, reverse

571
00:55:16,656 --> 00:55:25,154
card. No, you that does it for this duel, guys.

In our next episode, we will be doing another
duel episode. This time we are pitting Talon,

578
00:56:00,281 --> 00:56:06,585
a Batman villain from The Court of Owls, against
Nico Minoru, who is a Runaways character and

579
00:56:06,605 --> 00:56:11,228
affiliated with a different cult in Marvel known
as The Pride. But that does it for this episode,

next week. Up up and away, true believers.

585
00:56:40,185 --> 00:56:44,186
Neither the Infinity Gauntlet nor the Anti-Life
Equation can match the supreme might of my

586
00:56:44,226 --> 00:56:46,586
Draw 4 Uno Reverse card. Come at me.
