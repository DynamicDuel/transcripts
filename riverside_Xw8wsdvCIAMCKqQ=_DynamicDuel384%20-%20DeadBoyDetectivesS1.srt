00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,957
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,386 --> 00:00:29,227
Welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:34,629
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:35,049 --> 00:00:40,530
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother Marvelous
Joe. And in this episode, we are reviewing

5
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:46,632
the Netflix series Dead Boy Detectives, which
is adapted from a DC comic book of the same

6
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:52,078
name, whose lead characters debuted in the pages
of Sandman. Right, and there were even some

7
00:00:52,098 --> 00:00:58,261
characters from the Sandman series in this season
one of the show. I'm not gonna lie, I was a

8
00:00:58,321 --> 00:01:03,003
big hater of the show before it came out, based
on the God-awful trailer that came out prior

9
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:08,605
to its release, but I'm gonna change my tune
180 degrees, so look forward to that in our

10
00:01:08,625 --> 00:01:12,447
review. Before that, we're gonna break down
the comic book movie news from the past week,

11
00:01:12,547 --> 00:01:17,889
of which there were some doozies. We got our
first look at David Cornswett as Superman,

12
00:01:18,429 --> 00:01:24,412
and... John Malkovich, Ralph Innocent, and Paul
Walter Hauser have been cast in the MCU's Fantastic

13
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:28,978
Four film. As always, we list our segment times
in our episode description, so feel free to

14
00:01:29,018 --> 00:01:33,323
check out the show notes if you want to skip
ahead to a particular topic. And guys, our

15
00:01:33,364 --> 00:01:38,109
artificially intelligent duel simulator AJ9K
has a quick message for you, so listen up.

16
00:01:40,278 --> 00:01:45,341
Why hello there. Do you love listening and chatting
about Marvel and DC? Then become a part of

17
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:50,484
the dynamic duel community on Patreon, where
you can choose from three tiers. The dynamic

18
00:01:50,524 --> 00:01:55,908
2-0 tier lets you listen to this podcast without
ads and gives you access to its Discord chat

19
00:01:55,928 --> 00:02:00,762
group, where you can chat with Johnny DC and

20
00:02:00,802 --> 00:02:05,624
you that and more with two bonus episodes each
month, including bloopers and top ten shows

21
00:02:05,644 --> 00:02:10,447
where Johnny and Joe count down your favourite
Marvel and DC subjects. The X-Force tier makes

22
00:02:10,467 --> 00:02:15,089
you an executive producer of Dynamic Duel, where
every month you help the host choose what to

23
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:20,291
review and who to fight against each other.
And finally, the Dynamite Podcast Network tier

24
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:25,634
allows aspiring podcasters to create their own
battle-focused show using this Monte Carlo

25
00:02:25,674 --> 00:02:26,214
simulator.

26
00:02:45,866 --> 00:02:51,789
Thanks AJ9K and thanks to everyone who supports
the podcast, including Ken Johnson. He was

27
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:59,018
one of our very first executive producers. He's
also the host of the Max Destruction on Mother's

28
00:02:59,038 --> 00:03:03,542
Day, so we just want to give a shout out and
say happy birthday. If I could get you a gift

29
00:03:03,562 --> 00:03:08,966
from DC, it would be a case of Lobo's nuclear
shotgun shells. Because if I trusted anyone

30
00:03:08,986 --> 00:03:15,131
with the nuclear codes, Ken, it would be you.
And I would give you Ulysses Claus' arm cannon,

31
00:03:15,171 --> 00:03:20,116
because now that you're podcasting a lot, you
know, you could use the arm cannon to create

32
00:03:20,276 --> 00:03:24,740
objects out of the sound of your voice. What
am I saying? I don't know. But yeah, you could

33
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,242
do something with it. He'll find a way to use
it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Be sure to tune in to

34
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:34,367
Ken's show tomorrow, guys, because even though
Max Destruction is going on a season break,

35
00:03:34,688 --> 00:03:40,072
you'll be getting bonus episodes where co-host
Scotty Camacho reviews the Teenage Mutant Ninja

36
00:03:40,092 --> 00:03:44,416
Turtles movie with his brother Gil Camacho.
And on the Sendrow World podcast, host Zachary

37
00:03:44,436 --> 00:03:49,620
Hepburn speculates on fights between fan favorite
anime and manga characters. This Thursday,

38
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,025
we'll find out who would win between Giyu Tomioka
from Demon Slayer and Takeshi Yamamoto from

39
00:03:55,065 --> 00:03:59,723
Hitman Reborn. And on the Console Combat Podcast,
hosts John and Dean find out who would win

40
00:03:59,743 --> 00:04:04,365
in fights between popular video game characters.
In yesterday's episode, they reviewed the Paramount

41
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:10,827
Plus television series Knuckles. Visit dynamicpodcasts.com
or click the link in our show notes to listen

42
00:04:10,847 --> 00:04:15,849
to all of the shows in the DynaMic Podcast
Network. But with that out of the way, quick

43
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:22,128
to the no prize! A no prize is an award Marvel
used to give out to fans. Our version, the

44
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:26,592
Dynamic Duel No Prize, is a digital award we
post on Instagram for the person that we feel

45
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:31,816
gave the best answer to our question of the
week. Last week we asked, who is your favorite

46
00:04:31,856 --> 00:04:36,260
Superman villain and why? Got a lot of great
answers, let's go ahead and run down our three

47
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,185
honorable mentions as well as the no prize winner.
Our first honorable mention goes to John Spees,

48
00:04:42,485 --> 00:04:45,387
who said, Hey boys, John Spees here.

49
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:57,016
My favorite Superman villain is Batman. I like
to see those two go head to head. And I like

50
00:04:57,056 --> 00:05:05,243
to see Batman's brain work on how to defeat
this alien that he definitely just does not

51
00:05:05,303 --> 00:05:12,129
trust. It is interesting to see Batman fight
Superman, because it's two heroes who are battling

52
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:17,990
against each other. In a way, Bruce Wayne is
kind of like Lex Luthor. and that he's this

53
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:24,071
very intelligent individuel with no superpowers,
but somehow still finds ways to bring Superman

54
00:05:24,111 --> 00:05:30,053
down, as evidenced in comic books like The Dark
Knight Returns. And BVS, which John called

55
00:05:30,093 --> 00:05:36,015
shitty, and it is, but I will contend that the
ultimate edition of the movie, which I know

56
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:40,836
you shouldn't have to watch, but it is better.
I actually enjoy that version of the film.

57
00:05:40,856 --> 00:05:45,877
You should have to watch it because it's fantastic.
Way better than the theatrical version, which

58
00:05:45,937 --> 00:05:51,265
I agree is shitty. Ultimate version is not.
Great answer John, our next honorable mention

59
00:05:51,305 --> 00:06:01,252
goes to Scott Camacho who said Favorite Superman
villain is obviously Zod. I grew up watching

60
00:06:01,372 --> 00:06:11,319
the dynamics of Dragon Ball like Goku and Vegeta
and Power Rangers with the Red Ranger and then

61
00:06:11,359 --> 00:06:20,058
the evil Green Ranger. There was always the
the Nemesis who is the same as the protagonist

62
00:06:20,218 --> 00:06:25,803
and Zod is that for me for Superman. Yep, most
superheroes have at least one supervillain

63
00:06:25,823 --> 00:06:31,288
that is like a dark mirror reflection of the
hero and that's always pretty interesting because

64
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:37,313
it's an exploration on what would happen if
the hero that you love turned evil and how

65
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:43,414
the hero himself would deal against a similar
power set if they went bad. So yeah, Zod is

66
00:06:43,454 --> 00:06:47,915
a great foil in that regard for the character
of Superman. Yeah, Superman actually has a

67
00:06:48,215 --> 00:06:53,797
number of dark analogs. There's Zod, there's
Bizarro, there's Ultraman, but out of all of

68
00:06:53,817 --> 00:06:58,458
them I would agree that Zod is definitely the
most interesting. Great answer Scotty! Our

69
00:06:58,538 --> 00:07:04,740
final honorable mention goes to Judson Batty,
who said, Hi guys, Judson Batty here. If he

70
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:09,081
counts I would say that my favorite Superman
villain is Lobo. Though he's not really a villain,

71
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:13,695
but he's an anti-hero, he's a bounty hunter,
that's close enough. I think he's a great foil

72
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:18,458
for Superman, because he's really all Superman
could be if he went down that path with similar

73
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,582
powers, but not exactly the same, so he doesn't
feel like a copycat. I think that the bikey

74
00:07:23,642 --> 00:07:29,027
bounty hunter side of things is really cool,
and just really interesting to see him in stories,

75
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:35,612
and obviously space dolphins. Yeah, Lobo, in
a sense, is almost like a dark analog for Superman

76
00:07:35,652 --> 00:07:40,259
as well, and that he's just unbelievably rude.
Compared to Superman who's normally, you know,

77
00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:47,484
farm boy polite. He's gritty, he's dirty, he
kills like no one else He's a fantastic Superman

78
00:07:47,524 --> 00:07:52,848
foil. Jutsson's right though. He's not technically
a villain as wild as it may seem Considering

79
00:07:52,888 --> 00:07:58,292
how amoral the character is but yeah, he's regarded
as an anti-hero in the same vein of like Punisher

80
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:02,775
or Ghost Rider Those conflicting ideologies
often pit Superman and Lobo up against each

81
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:09,079
other. But last episode Jutsson wanted to make
sure that we knew that he was Australian, not

82
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:14,124
British. And then in the notes of his voicemail,
he wanted to clarify that he was Australian,

83
00:08:14,324 --> 00:08:20,410
not Austrian, as Jonathan and I got him confused
for in the last episode. So yeah, just to clarify,

84
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:27,557
Jutson is a Kiwi from Australia, known for Lord
of the Rings and It's Sheep and my favorite

85
00:08:27,577 --> 00:08:33,582
band of all time, The Flight of the Concords.
Yeah, go Australia and go Jutson. Great answer,

86
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:38,024
we want to give a special thanks to Miggy Methengyan
and Travis Herndon, who also took the time

87
00:08:38,044 --> 00:08:43,807
to call in with their answers. But the winner
of this week's No Prize is Christopher Minotti,

88
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:51,091
who said, Hi guys, Christopher Minotti. My favorite
Superman villain has to be Brainiac. I love

89
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:58,235
this character. Not only is he an alien super
genius, but he also collects worlds, and he

90
00:08:58,435 --> 00:09:04,650
even let Krypton die. I love that, I think that's
great. I think he looks really cool, honestly,

91
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:11,073
as well. His ship is really cool. And I especially
love his look in the Injustice games. Yeah,

92
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:15,075
there was something really cool they did in
those games with Brainiac having the tentacles

93
00:09:15,095 --> 00:09:20,397
like Doctor Octopus. I wish that was his look
in the comics like that needs to be canon because

94
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:26,280
it's just really cool. But even without the
tentacles, Brainiac is just a top tier villain.

95
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,343
He's also my favorite villain for Superman and
that he's just a strong. but he's also world

96
00:09:32,403 --> 00:09:36,946
smarter and has the technology to back that
up. Yeah, it's an absolute crime that Brainiac

97
00:09:36,966 --> 00:09:42,391
has not been in a live-action Superman movie
yet and so I thought I would try to remedy

98
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:49,957
that by writing a pitch for Jonathan on what
a sequel to Man of Steel should be. And I called

99
00:09:49,977 --> 00:09:54,361
it Man of Tomorrow and you can listen to my
pitch that I gave to Jonathan on our Patreon.

100
00:09:54,781 --> 00:09:58,424
Yeah, that was heartbreaking. I'm still thinking
about that pitch. That was a fantastic pitch.

101
00:09:58,444 --> 00:10:02,997
They should have made that movie. Idiots! Not
you, Christopher! You're a genius, great answer!

102
00:10:03,298 --> 00:10:07,143
You win this week's note prize. If you the listener
want a shot at winning your own note prize,

103
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:11,049
stay tuned till later on in this episode when
we'll be asking another Question of the Week.

104
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,693
But now that that's done, on to the news!

105
00:10:19,246 --> 00:10:26,089
Okay, so this past week we got our very first
look at actor David Cornsweat in the Superman

106
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:31,853
costume, which I've been waiting forever for.
I was super pumped for this. And when it finally

107
00:10:31,873 --> 00:10:38,817
came, I felt the way that I usually feel upon
seeing first looks of characters in their costumes,

108
00:10:39,237 --> 00:10:44,920
a little underwhelmed. I would agree. The costume
itself is pretty solid. I'm just a little bit

109
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:50,349
confused as to the execution. of the image that
they chose to present in that instead of this

110
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:57,775
heroic Superman pose, we're getting what appears
to be Superman getting dressed after the condom

111
00:10:57,795 --> 00:11:02,460
broke. It's really what it looks like. Yeah,
it looks like he was about to knock boots with

112
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,343
the low slam, then saw the big laser in the
sky. He's like, damn it, put my boots back

113
00:11:06,464 --> 00:11:12,009
on. But yeah, it's a strange image to release
for your first look at Superman. You would

114
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:18,057
imagine. that it would be something much more
majestic considering the nature of Superman

115
00:11:18,097 --> 00:11:23,681
and him being almost like this god-like figure.
But they really decided to focus on the man

116
00:11:23,781 --> 00:11:30,987
rather than the super in this. And I don't quite
know why I wouldn't have done that. I definitely

117
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:35,430
wouldn't have shown him looking as tired as
he looks considering the fact that this giant

118
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:41,134
eyeball is lasering like half of Metropolis
behind him. You know he could hear that. Yeah,

119
00:11:41,174 --> 00:11:46,758
I think the image is supposed to evoke Alex
Ross's art of Superman sitting in his recliner

120
00:11:46,798 --> 00:11:51,262
chair, which was a really humanizing image for
the character of Superman, if you guys are

121
00:11:51,442 --> 00:11:57,307
aware of the painting. This definitely calls
back to that, but by including the danger in

122
00:11:57,327 --> 00:12:02,171
the background, it makes Superman seem apathetic,
which is not a good look. I mean, just overall,

123
00:12:02,511 --> 00:12:06,174
the whole image is not a good look. Even if
the outfit turns out to be incredible, it's

124
00:12:06,214 --> 00:12:11,154
not really showcased in this image, considering
he's sitting down and it's folded. and bunches

125
00:12:11,214 --> 00:12:16,116
up in weird places. Yeah, the costume is definitely
a departure from what we've seen in the past

126
00:12:16,176 --> 00:12:21,178
in terms of like skin tight costumes that Superman
can wear under his shirt. You know, when he

127
00:12:21,218 --> 00:12:28,041
rips it open, he has a suit already on. This
outfit is not going under any clothes. If anything,

128
00:12:28,101 --> 00:12:32,783
it's almost like a jacket that goes over a shirt.
Yeah, unless Clark can't wears nothing but

129
00:12:32,823 --> 00:12:36,864
chunky sweaters. There's no way we're going
to get that, you know, rip open the shirt to

130
00:12:36,904 --> 00:12:41,379
get the Superman costume reveal. You're absolutely
right. I also wish they would have gone with

131
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:47,423
a suit that was a little bit more clean. This
one definitely looks battle worn, to put it

132
00:12:47,463 --> 00:12:53,187
nicely. Well, it probably is. I assume that
whatever scene this shot was taken from happens

133
00:12:53,227 --> 00:12:57,490
later in the movie. Well, if it's battle worn,
he needs to throw that thing in the wash after

134
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:02,054
the battle because you don't want to go into
a battle looking like you smell. All right.

135
00:13:02,374 --> 00:13:06,697
It's just not impressive. It does look stinky,
doesn't it? It looks like a stinky Superman

136
00:13:06,737 --> 00:13:14,385
suit. I honestly don't hate the suit. It's very
different from what I was expecting. I'm actually

137
00:13:14,486 --> 00:13:18,128
really looking forward to seeing this thing
in movement and maybe, you know, with him standing

138
00:13:18,248 --> 00:13:23,172
up without it being so wrinkled and dirty. Because
otherwise, I think it's a pretty good shot.

139
00:13:23,212 --> 00:13:28,796
I love David Cornswett's hair. Not loving his
jawline, but I'm also assuming that's just

140
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:34,080
from him, you know, like, looking down and not
like off into the horizon with this hopeful

141
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,386
demeanor. He definitely has bulked up. I was
recently looking at photos of him and how much

142
00:13:39,506 --> 00:13:44,468
bigger he's gotten since being cast as Superman
and the guy's almost as big as Henry Cavill.

143
00:13:44,508 --> 00:13:50,249
It's insane. Definitely doing steroids. Hopefully
that doesn't affect him long term, but it's

144
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:56,511
a thing. I think he looks tired here, but again,
it's not the shot I wanted. I'm sure I would

145
00:13:56,551 --> 00:14:01,232
have a better impression if they chose a better
pose for the character. He actually reminds

146
00:14:01,272 --> 00:14:04,813
me a lot of Henry Cavill, which brings us to
our question of the week.

152
00:14:33,243 --> 00:14:38,205
Be sure to answer before May 18th. In other
news, we received word this past week that

153
00:14:38,658 --> 00:14:43,940
Three major actors have joined the cast of the
MCU's Fantastic Four. We have John Malkovich,

154
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:51,163
Ralph Innocent, and Paul Walter Hauser in roles
for that upcoming film. That also stars Pedro

155
00:14:51,183 --> 00:14:55,965
Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Joseph Quinn, and Yvonne
Moss-Bachrock. Still not sure if I'm pronouncing

156
00:14:56,005 --> 00:15:00,587
that correctly. The only actor here that was
announced that is attached to a specific role

157
00:15:00,687 --> 00:15:06,469
is Ralph Innocent, who's going to play Galactus,
and holy shit, that is a fantastic casting

158
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:11,700
choice for Galactus. Yeah, I'm not familiar
with the actor at all, but once I saw his face,

159
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:16,103
I was like, yeah, that's Galactus. Yeah, I guess
his face kind of looks like it. I don't think

160
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:20,086
it'll be, you know, Ralph Innocent in a purple
rubber suit or anything like that. I'm sure

161
00:15:20,106 --> 00:15:24,589
they'll go some kind of CG route or motion capture
type thing. But, you know, it's better than

162
00:15:24,609 --> 00:15:29,933
a cloud. We know that Galactus will actually
have a voice. And what a voice to have in Ralph

163
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:36,674
Innocent. The only movie that I've ever seen,
Ralph In, was The Vavitch. And he was. really

164
00:15:36,714 --> 00:15:40,737
good in that movie. It was that was a scary
movie. Jonathan, you should watch it. Yeah,

165
00:15:40,757 --> 00:15:47,984
that's not going to happen. His voice is deeper
than the Marianas Trench. Damn. Out of all

166
00:15:48,024 --> 00:15:53,209
the human beings on Earth, his is probably the
only voice suitable to portraying this world

167
00:15:53,229 --> 00:15:58,193
devouring godlike character. Yeah, I think it's
solid casting along with John Malkovich and

168
00:15:58,273 --> 00:16:02,837
Paul Walter Hauser. No idea who these guys are
playing. Of course, John Malkovich could play.

169
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:08,259
friggin any role he wants and he would just
nail it. But also Paul Wachterhauser, I only

170
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:13,580
know him from the Cobra Kai series, but I'm
really hoping he gets to play Mole Man. Yeah,

171
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,462
that would be good for Mole Man. Also on the
Discord, I heard someone suggest John Malkovich

172
00:16:18,522 --> 00:16:22,183
for Puppet Master and that would be absolute
perfection. I think it would be surprising

173
00:16:22,223 --> 00:16:28,204
if we got Galactus and Puppet Master and Mole
Man in the same film, but you never know, you

174
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:31,845
never know. Marvel may be putting all their
chips on the table in order to make sure this

175
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:36,832
is the ultimate. Fantastic Four movie. Well,
if it's an alternate universe, maybe they can

176
00:16:36,852 --> 00:16:40,995
do all of these characters and then just kill
them off and reintroduce them at a later point.

177
00:16:41,616 --> 00:16:45,939
Perhaps, perhaps. But yeah, super excited for
this movie. I can't wait to get our first look

178
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:50,362
at the costume reveals of the Fantastic Four.
I guess we kind of got them as a drawing of

179
00:16:50,402 --> 00:16:55,285
these characters, but I'm not sure if those
were the final outfits for the FF. We'll see.

180
00:16:55,425 --> 00:17:01,429
The movie is slated to hit theaters on July
25th, 2025. So a little over a year from now.

181
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:07,393
Wait, that's the release date? Yeah. That's
like only a week after Superman is released.

182
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:13,057
Good. Superman's being released on July 11th,
2025. Well, I can't wait for the Fantastic

183
00:17:13,097 --> 00:17:17,220
Four to take all of Superman's money. That'll
make me smile. If you think the Fantastic Four

184
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,583
are more popular than Superman, you have another
thing coming, my friend. It's not about who's

185
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:26,746
more popular. Look at how much money BVS made.
You seem to think it's about popularity when

186
00:17:26,786 --> 00:17:31,089
in fact it's about what's a better movie. OK,
Superman. Yeah. OK.

187
00:17:38,262 --> 00:17:42,106
That does it for all the news for this episode.
Now let's move on to the main event, where

188
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:47,633
we review season one of the Netflix series,
Dead Boy Detectives.

189
00:18:03,598 --> 00:18:08,881
Dead Boy Detectives is an 8 episode Netflix
exclusive television series with Steve Yawkey

190
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:14,864
as the showrunner, who is also the lead writer
on The Flight Attendant for Max. Dead Boy Detectives

191
00:18:15,004 --> 00:18:20,328
is the second Netflix series in their Sandman
universe, the first being the acclaimed series

192
00:18:20,408 --> 00:18:26,231
The Sandman, which we gave 4 and a half stars
in our season 1 review. I'm a big fan of Sandman,

193
00:18:26,471 --> 00:18:31,018
the Dead Boy Detectives are only a tiny part
of that universe, but But I enjoyed their appearance

194
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:36,540
on the Doom Patrol series in season 3 for that
show. The Netflix series was originally going

195
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:42,101
to be produced as a spin-off of Doom Patrol
for the Max platform, but Warner Bros. decided

196
00:18:42,141 --> 00:18:46,783
to allow Netflix to make the show instead as
part of their Sandman universe, which makes

197
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:52,444
sense considering the titular characters made
their debut in the pages of the Sandman comic.

198
00:18:52,725 --> 00:18:58,139
The characters are admittedly pretty obscure.
So if you don't know anything about them or

199
00:18:58,219 --> 00:19:02,803
don't want to know anything about the show prior
to watching it, I suggest you hit pause now

200
00:19:02,883 --> 00:19:07,407
and watch the show because it's pretty damn
good. And then come back and listen to this

201
00:19:07,447 --> 00:19:12,932
review. Yeah, I highly recommend watching it.
I concur that it is very good. I didn't actually

202
00:19:12,992 --> 00:19:18,456
want to watch this show at all. I didn't want
to review it. And that is all based off of

203
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:22,900
my feelings about the first trailer that came
out for Dead Boy Detective season one, which

204
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,199
was an atrocity. I actually went back. after
I watched this show and then rewatched that

205
00:19:27,219 --> 00:19:33,163
trailer and I totally feel like the trailer
editor should have been fired because in no

206
00:19:33,203 --> 00:19:38,867
way shape or form captured the coolness that
was this show. I totally take back everything

207
00:19:38,947 --> 00:19:44,491
I said, including my initial gripe that the
two main actors looked too similar to each

208
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:48,473
other. Oh yeah. Now, when you actually watch
the show, it's highly apparent that they're

209
00:19:48,493 --> 00:19:54,057
not even, you know, the same race. I think the
cast was just phenomenal for this show across

210
00:19:54,077 --> 00:19:59,580
the board. hands down. The cast is definitely
one of the highlights of the series by far

211
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,323
and I'll get into that later on. But I agree
with you, Netflix is notoriously not great

212
00:20:05,343 --> 00:20:10,886
with marketing. I kind of feel like they don't
feel like they need to be because they're churning

213
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:16,409
out so much content all the time. They tend
to not want to focus on one particular thing,

214
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:20,051
especially when it comes to series like these
where people aren't really familiar with the

215
00:20:20,071 --> 00:20:24,902
characters or there isn't a really big name
attached to it. Again, These characters are

216
00:20:24,942 --> 00:20:30,905
obscure, even for comic fans. Now in the comics,
the Dead Boy Detectives, namely Edwin Payne

217
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:36,949
and Charles Roland, are only 13 years old, but
because they've lived for decades, their stories

218
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:42,392
in the comics tended to be a bit more mature
in terms of horror and violence, and they were

219
00:20:42,452 --> 00:20:47,815
often published by DC's mature imprints such
as Vertigo or Black Label. This series, for

220
00:20:47,835 --> 00:20:52,938
the most part, matched that same kind of mature
tone. It's TVMA. And in my opinion, The tone

221
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:58,662
was a terrific blend of quirky, dark comedy
and weird supernatural horror, very much in

222
00:20:58,702 --> 00:21:03,185
the same vein as Doom Patrol, a show I loved
and will miss, so it's nice to have this as

223
00:21:03,245 --> 00:21:09,249
somewhat of a replacement. Absolutely, yeah.
When Doom Patrol finished up its last season,

224
00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:14,192
it kind of left a void out there in the superhero
television genre. I think Dead Boy Detective

225
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:19,075
Season 1 filled that niche perfectly. Which
is high praise because I really liked Doom

226
00:21:19,095 --> 00:21:26,992
Patrol. Yeah, same. I think fairly high ratings
in the course of its run. But one thing I think

227
00:21:27,032 --> 00:21:32,895
this series definitely has over Doom Patrol
is its production value. I'm not sure if the

228
00:21:32,915 --> 00:21:38,077
show is actually more expensive, but it would
not surprise me. Dead Boy Detectives doesn't

229
00:21:38,277 --> 00:21:43,320
look as expensive as Sandman, but in terms of
the special effects, the cinematography, it's

230
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,286
all an upgrade from Doom Patrol. And in that
regard. I'm actually glad the show made the

231
00:21:48,326 --> 00:21:53,889
jump to Netflix because it seems like they really
aren't afraid of investing in the Sandman universe.

232
00:21:54,409 --> 00:21:59,851
Now, the cast of the Dead Boy Detectives on
Do Patrol, I thought, was terrific. They were

233
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:05,034
originally supposed to be in the Max show, but
that changed in the transition to Netflix,

234
00:22:05,314 --> 00:22:10,136
at least for all of the cast members, except
for the actress who played Night Nurse, strangely

235
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:15,066
enough. Yeah, I thought that was strange. She
is a good actress, so I don't know. My impression

236
00:22:15,086 --> 00:22:20,550
was that the actors who played Charles and Edwin
in the Doom Patrol series were much more comic

237
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:25,114
book accurate because I know the characters
like one's a blonde, one's a brunette. And

238
00:22:25,294 --> 00:22:30,918
on this Netflix show, they're both brunettes
who look like they're 18 years old. In the

239
00:22:30,938 --> 00:22:35,081
Doom Patrol series, they looked a lot younger.
But that's not to discount the Netflix cast.

240
00:22:35,101 --> 00:22:39,124
They were less accurate to the source material,
but they were still phenomenal. They're their

241
00:22:39,344 --> 00:22:45,770
own thing. The Doom Patrol cast is absolutely
more comics accurate in terms of look, but

242
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:51,174
I think the new cast definitely captured the
spirit of the characters pretty well. And also

243
00:22:51,214 --> 00:22:55,638
considering, you know, it is a mature show,
it's not surprising they went with a slightly

244
00:22:55,718 --> 00:23:00,082
older cast, even though they keep calling them
kids in the show and boys. And I'm like, dude,

245
00:23:00,242 --> 00:23:05,987
you look like you're 21. Yeah, I've never seen
such a independent group of 16 year olds in

246
00:23:06,007 --> 00:23:11,450
my entire life. For real. Like going out and
like. Yeah, like renting rooms and stuff like

247
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:16,633
that. I wasn't doing that at 16. When I first
saw the trailer for this, I was pretty sad

248
00:23:16,953 --> 00:23:21,615
that they didn't go with a Doom Patrol cast.
That didn't survive very long once I started

249
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:26,457
watching the show, because, as I mentioned earlier,
one of the major draws of the Netflix show

250
00:23:26,677 --> 00:23:31,980
is its charismatic cast and their chemistry.
Charismatic is the perfect word for sure. Yeah,

251
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,122
and the charisma goes even beyond the leads.
Like even with. basic filler, you could say

252
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:42,826
superfluous characters such as Nico and Jenny,
it's kind of hard to imagine the show without

253
00:23:42,866 --> 00:23:48,489
them because the actors gave such endearing
performances. While the show's major drawback

254
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:54,272
is that it's loaded with story threads and subplots
that lead nowhere, such as Nico's parents or

255
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:58,775
Jenny's stalker, there's still enough to enjoy
there that you wouldn't mind if the characters

256
00:23:58,815 --> 00:24:03,257
returned for a second season with how well they
work with the main characters of Edwin, Charles,

257
00:24:03,277 --> 00:24:07,927
and Crystal. Yeah, I think this is the only
show where I didn't mind getting sidetracked

258
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:12,549
a little bit. I don't know why. I don't know
if it was due to the serial nature of the show,

259
00:24:12,589 --> 00:24:16,531
kind of where they were working on a different
case every episode. But I just enjoyed the

260
00:24:16,551 --> 00:24:22,074
world building, I guess. And the more they expanded
on that, the more I felt like I was immersed

261
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:26,015
into the small Washington town. Yeah, I don't
know if I would describe the show as serial.

262
00:24:26,135 --> 00:24:30,397
I would probably describe it as procedural.
It had this procedural nature, almost like.

263
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:36,312
You know, a NYPD blue episode where there's
like a new case to solve each week, a new mystery

264
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:41,134
for the detectives to solve each episode. I
loved that. Yeah, it was fun to watch. That's

265
00:24:41,154 --> 00:24:47,556
what I was hoping She-Hulk would be, where it
would be a new law case every week. But that

266
00:24:47,576 --> 00:24:51,838
didn't quite pan out. Yeah, that would have
made She-Hulk so much better. And that show

267
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:56,120
had like a lot of side characters as well. You
know, I feel like Dead Boy Detectives is a

268
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,654
perfect template for how She-Hulk should have
gone. Exactly. I would have loved that. Now

269
00:25:00,674 --> 00:25:05,897
in terms of smaller characters such as Cat King,
Tragic Mick the Walrus, and the foul-mouthed

270
00:25:06,077 --> 00:25:10,720
Dandelion sprites, who I'm sure some people
found annoying, but I found hilarious, they

271
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:18,745
also seem to blend themselves into the overarching
story and the episodic nature seamlessly almost.

272
00:25:18,765 --> 00:25:23,988
There were a few cameos that didn't quite work
I think, but may later on in subsequent seasons,

273
00:25:24,428 --> 00:25:30,488
including Despair and I don't know if you remember
him. He was the ringed man inside of Angie

274
00:25:30,508 --> 00:25:35,711
the sea monster. No idea who that guy is. I
don't recognize him from the comics, but to

275
00:25:35,731 --> 00:25:41,154
be fair, I haven't read all of the Dead Boy
Detective graphic novels yet. If I had to guess

276
00:25:41,174 --> 00:25:46,377
though, maybe he's a character we'll see appear
again in Sandman, though that's just a shot

277
00:25:46,397 --> 00:25:52,320
in the dark. I actually liked the despair cameo.
I thought that was just a very surreal scene

278
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,599
when Edwin meets her among the floating mirrors.
Yeah, that was interesting. And I guess it

279
00:25:56,659 --> 00:26:02,604
also kind of fit with the whole nature of how
Edwin and Charles are able to traverse the

280
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:07,227
world by going through mirrors. Now, that's
something that they took from the Doom Patrol

281
00:26:07,267 --> 00:26:12,331
show when they traversed the mirror into the
underworld. They don't do that in the comics.

282
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:16,695
They can teleport naturally wherever they want,
although it's like uncomfortable for them to

283
00:26:16,735 --> 00:26:21,599
do so. The whole mirror play was interesting.
And I wonder if they did that with the intention

284
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:28,393
of playing upon despair, because her whole realm.
is mirrors in the comics. Interesting. Well,

285
00:26:28,413 --> 00:26:31,916
she did tell Edwin that, you know, they were
friends now and that she would be seeing him

286
00:26:31,956 --> 00:26:37,801
again later. I'm assuming maybe in Sandman season
two. I hope so. I would love to see these guys

287
00:26:37,881 --> 00:26:41,964
make an appearance, because actually they're
due for one in the next season if they're following

288
00:26:42,104 --> 00:26:47,529
the comic books. It was like issue 25, I believe,
of Sandman, which would fall in season two

289
00:26:47,849 --> 00:26:51,933
of where the characters were introduced. Nice.
But let's talk more about the characters in

290
00:26:51,953 --> 00:26:57,400
the character breakdown. starting with Edwin
Payne. Now he was played by George Rexdrew,

291
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:02,743
and this is basically his first performance
ever on screen. As you mentioned, he definitely

292
00:27:02,783 --> 00:27:07,885
didn't look like the character from the comics,
but he gave a fantastic performance, I thought,

293
00:27:07,966 --> 00:27:13,088
for sure. As this brainy amateur magician of
the group, you know, one who died as a ritual

294
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:18,271
sacrifice to a demon at his school, and whose
soul was traded amongst the demons in Hell,

295
00:27:18,611 --> 00:27:23,534
which he eventually escaped. When he returns
to the mortal plane, in the same place where

296
00:27:23,574 --> 00:27:29,598
he died, the attic of his school, he found Charles
there dying and he stayed with him. I'm not

297
00:27:29,658 --> 00:27:34,300
sure if he did that out of sympathy for someone
else at the school who was bullied and killed,

298
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:40,704
like in the comics, or from romantic attraction
to Charles, which has only recently come out

299
00:27:40,764 --> 00:27:45,727
in the comics, or because he wanted to start
doing good to avoid hell should he ever be

300
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:51,354
caught by death. It may have been all of the
above, but motivation wise, Being good and

301
00:27:51,414 --> 00:27:56,378
doing good to avoid hell is definitely what
drives Edwin in the series. A truth that was

302
00:27:56,418 --> 00:28:02,303
revealed to him by the Cat King. You know, Edwin
helps ghosts because he loved detective stories

303
00:28:02,323 --> 00:28:07,627
when he was alive and because it's the right
thing to do. I am still shocked that you said

304
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:13,351
that this was his first performance because
I thought the actor as Edwin did a phenomenal

305
00:28:13,391 --> 00:28:19,511
job. I totally bought him as this like young...
gay Sherlock Holmes with some like Constantine-esque

306
00:28:19,671 --> 00:28:24,615
magic tricks at his disposal. And I think he
did a really good job of not only selling him

307
00:28:24,695 --> 00:28:29,718
as this like closed off character who's actually
been through lifetimes of misery, but also

308
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:35,561
I think he sold the romantic aspects too. You
know, this pining for someone that is unattainable

309
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:41,345
just felt very tragic and there's a lot that's
tragic about Edwin and it all just came across

310
00:28:41,525 --> 00:28:47,634
expertly. Yeah, the romantic angle was a slow
build, but it felt very natural. I think they

311
00:28:47,674 --> 00:28:51,857
did a terrific job with that. Yeah, there was
a huge payoff when he finally admitted his

312
00:28:51,877 --> 00:28:55,940
feelings to Charles. And I think I remember
that from the Doom Patrol series too. I think

313
00:28:56,161 --> 00:29:01,305
they said that Edwin was attracted to Charles.
But yeah, that felt like such an epic moment,

314
00:29:01,645 --> 00:29:06,109
not only because they were escaping hell, but
because the emotional stakes were so huge as

315
00:29:06,169 --> 00:29:10,232
well. So you just had a lot going on there.
It felt very climactic. Oh yeah, absolutely.

316
00:29:10,252 --> 00:29:14,462
That was one of my favorite episodes, actually.
But for as much as he has romantic feelings

317
00:29:14,542 --> 00:29:20,724
for Charles, you could also see Edwin continuing
his magic studies and detective work without

318
00:29:20,764 --> 00:29:26,565
him if it ever came to that. Whereas Charles
definitely seems to be more attached to Edwin,

319
00:29:26,686 --> 00:29:32,187
interestingly. He's protective over him because
he is a good friend in that way. Yeah, exactly.

320
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:36,448
Now, one difference from the comics that I wanna
point out that I thought they did really well

321
00:29:36,468 --> 00:29:40,709
in the show was the reason that he went to hell.
Now, that's never explained in the comics.

322
00:29:41,058 --> 00:29:46,000
He was sacrificed by bullies in the school,
but like, why would that send someone to hell?

323
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,163
The reasoning for him to go to hell in the show
is, you know, because he was a sacrifice to

324
00:29:51,203 --> 00:29:55,866
a demon, so the demon took him, I thought was
much better. You never see that in the comic.

325
00:29:56,206 --> 00:30:01,409
That was a horrifying but quirky scene in that,
you know, the demon showed up during the sacrifice

326
00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:07,332
and killed everybody. But kind of, it seems
like he knew that Edwin was being sacrificed

327
00:30:07,532 --> 00:30:11,710
unethically or something, because he's like,
Yeah. Sorry, mate. Gotta take you cause you're

328
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:16,653
a sacrifice. Let's go, you know? It's a technicality.
What are you gonna do? Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.

329
00:30:17,553 --> 00:30:23,157
Moving on to Charles Rowland, he was played
by Jaden Reverie, who is a veteran actor, but

330
00:30:23,177 --> 00:30:28,200
I thought his chemistry with George Ruxrew was
perfect. They're both fantastic actors. Yeah,

331
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:34,103
I remember during the trailer that like I did
not wanna like this show, as I think I've mentioned

332
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:39,946
before. I think my fear of the show was that
it would be too- Gen Z for me because just

333
00:30:39,986 --> 00:30:45,027
the look of the actor who plays Edwin seems
very of the current time, you know, of the

334
00:30:45,047 --> 00:30:49,769
current young generation of people. And the
show itself, I thought would be unapproachable

335
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:53,910
because I wouldn't get a lot of it. But if anything,
it helped me feel a little bit more connected

336
00:30:53,930 --> 00:31:00,632
to Gen Z. It's pretty interesting. It is interesting
because his look actually isn't, I guess it

337
00:31:00,672 --> 00:31:05,753
is Gen Z, but that's just circling back to the
time, the 80s, when Charles died, which was

338
00:31:05,813 --> 00:31:11,975
the late 80s. Yeah, it's fascinating how style
kind of revolves like that. Now, Charles is

339
00:31:12,015 --> 00:31:16,436
the muscle and feisty gadgeteer of sorts for
the group. He's equipped with a bag that can

340
00:31:16,476 --> 00:31:20,857
hold an infinite number of items, including
a badass cricket bat that's kind of like Mjolnir.

341
00:31:21,357 --> 00:31:26,819
Charles is also motivated like Edwin to do good,
not because of where he'll go in the afterlife,

342
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:32,841
but because he always tried to please his abusive
father in life. And now he likes to please

343
00:31:32,881 --> 00:31:37,398
his friend Edwin, who was there for him when
no one else ever was. and of course, Crystal,

344
00:31:37,418 --> 00:31:42,400
his love interest. We were talking about how
tragic Edwin's character was. I think that

345
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:46,682
Charles is just as tragic. That was so heartbreaking
later on in the series when we actually see

346
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:50,984
how Charles died. It made me angry because he
didn't deserve that. You know, neither of these

347
00:31:51,024 --> 00:31:55,926
boys deserve to die and it made you want to
root for them in the afterlife, especially

348
00:31:55,946 --> 00:32:00,749
when you get those speeches from Edwin, I think
in like episode two, where he was like, no

349
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:04,963
one cared about our murders. Like they weren't.
bothered to be solved or anything like that.

350
00:32:05,043 --> 00:32:10,727
So we have to solve these cases for the people
like us. And the whole abuse thing with Charles

351
00:32:10,767 --> 00:32:16,712
specifically just broke my heart. Oh, absolutely.
Yeah. His origin is interesting in that it's

352
00:32:16,732 --> 00:32:22,336
another example of how this show borrowed elements
from the Doom Patrol, specifically him being

353
00:32:22,476 --> 00:32:28,861
stoned in a river where he also caught hypothermia.
In the comics, Charles was burned and stabbed

354
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:34,519
by the same bullies that sacrificed Edwin 70
years earlier. When they died, they went to

355
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:41,542
hell, but in the comics, Lucifer gave up on
ruling hell, so all of the denizens of hell

356
00:32:41,682 --> 00:32:46,844
came back to the mortal plane. That's how Edwin
came back, that's how his bullies came back,

357
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:51,586
and the same ones who killed Edwin were the
same ones who killed Charles. Interesting.

358
00:32:52,027 --> 00:32:56,228
Yeah, I don't know if I like that as much. No,
this show was a perfect adaptation in that

359
00:32:56,448 --> 00:33:01,695
it improved the source of material, in my opinion.
Moving on to Crystal Palace, she was played

360
00:33:01,735 --> 00:33:07,239
by Cassius Nelson. I don't know too much about
her other than she's a Brit who can pull off

361
00:33:07,339 --> 00:33:13,604
a hell of an American accent. Oh, my God. I
didn't even know she was a Brit. I liked the

362
00:33:13,624 --> 00:33:18,528
Crystal Palace that was in Doom Patrol. I remember
thinking after watching the trailer that I

363
00:33:18,588 --> 00:33:23,992
don't understand why they cast this new Crystal
Palace, and I could not be more wrong. So wrong

364
00:33:24,052 --> 00:33:29,551
was so good in this series. She was so good,
she blew me away with almost every line delivery.

365
00:33:29,651 --> 00:33:33,554
She's phenomenal. I could totally see why she
was cast. And I think I judged her way too

366
00:33:33,574 --> 00:33:37,716
harshly based off of just simple lines like,
that's a fucking stupid name, just because

367
00:33:38,136 --> 00:33:43,239
I didn't want to agree with what she was saying.
But you know, her whole arc is that she was

368
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,802
kind of an asshole back in the day. This is
her redemption arc, as it were. It's also your

369
00:33:47,822 --> 00:33:55,187
redemption arc, apparently. It is my- yeah.
Absolutely. She was phenomenal. Yeah, no, the

370
00:33:55,267 --> 00:34:00,151
actress who played her, Cassius Nelson, Cassius,
I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing her name correctly.

371
00:34:00,511 --> 00:34:04,475
But yeah, she's definitely going places. I will
be learning how to pronounce her name as I'm

372
00:34:04,515 --> 00:34:09,519
sure everyone will be because yeah, she's fantastic.
She's definitely the breakout star of the show.

373
00:34:09,979 --> 00:34:16,165
Dude, everyone, everyone is the breakout star
of the show. Her, Nico, Jenny, the boys, everyone.

374
00:34:16,565 --> 00:34:21,309
That's true, fair enough. No, Crystal is the
psychic human of the group who proves her value

375
00:34:21,349 --> 00:34:25,803
to the boys. through her psychic visions and
ability to interact with other humans to get

376
00:34:25,883 --> 00:34:31,725
easy answers. Her motivation in the show is
twofold. One to find out more about her past

377
00:34:31,805 --> 00:34:36,667
and eventually return home, but also to prove
that David, the demon who possessed her and

378
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:42,050
continues to torment her throughout the series,
is wrong about her nature and that she is in

379
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:47,572
fact a good person capable of doing good things.
So it's interesting how the three main characters

380
00:34:47,592 --> 00:34:53,690
sort of have the same motivation in the series
of simply to do good. She has less strong feelings

381
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:58,653
for Charles as he does for her, but the love
triangle between the three results in some

382
00:34:58,713 --> 00:35:03,396
decent tension for the story that I thought
worked really well. In the comics, Crystal's

383
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:09,019
parents were jerk performance artists who simply
let her do whatever she wanted, but she was

384
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:13,681
always a nice person and to my knowledge she
was never possessed by a demon named David.

385
00:35:13,721 --> 00:35:18,584
That's an original character, but I thought
a strong one and it's like a great ghost for

386
00:35:18,624 --> 00:35:23,359
the character, like this haunted past for her.
that worked really well with the story. And

387
00:35:23,399 --> 00:35:28,724
again, another example of how the show plusses
the comic. Plus that exorcism scene was just

388
00:35:28,844 --> 00:35:33,848
really cool. Oh yeah, when David runs out underneath
the sheet out of the subway. Yeah. That was

389
00:35:33,868 --> 00:35:38,432
cool. Now there's a ton of characters. I do
want to touch on the two villains before we

390
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:43,097
get into the plot breakdown, starting with Night
Nurse. She was played by Ruth Cornell. Again,

391
00:35:43,117 --> 00:35:48,581
she was the same actress who played a very different
version of Night Nurse in the Doom Patrol show.

392
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:54,553
Now she's not to be confused with Asa, the Nightmare
Nurse from Justice League Dark, though I think

393
00:35:54,593 --> 00:36:00,036
she may have been an inspiration for the character.
Night Nurse is original to Doom Patrol and

394
00:36:00,076 --> 00:36:05,218
the series. Now Night Nurse is a strict, by
the book, caretaker of the children's nursery

395
00:36:05,299 --> 00:36:10,481
in the afterlife. A limbo of sorts that tracks
the souls of dead children and ushers them

396
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:16,405
where they need to go. I didn't really like
her character initially, like her scenes were

397
00:36:16,425 --> 00:36:22,012
the most dull to me. even though I understood
she represented the stakes of Edwin and Charles

398
00:36:22,032 --> 00:36:27,596
being hunted by death. I did get her motivation,
however, that she felt Edwin and Charles were

399
00:36:27,636 --> 00:36:32,260
cheating death and I also liked how she ended
up helping the boys in the end, even being

400
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,423
assigned to be their handler. That was fantastic.
I loved that reversal because, you know, she

401
00:36:37,483 --> 00:36:41,827
is charismatic as well. You didn't really root
against her because you kind of understood

402
00:36:41,847 --> 00:36:46,442
where she was coming from like you said. So
to all of a sudden have these characters working

403
00:36:46,502 --> 00:36:51,867
together by the end was a nice turn of events.
Moving on to the other villain, Esther Finch,

404
00:36:52,227 --> 00:36:58,093
she was played by Jen Lyon, who was fantastic
and effortlessly charismatic in her performance.

405
00:36:58,653 --> 00:37:03,417
It's kind of hammy, but in the best way, and
it looked like she had a ton of fun with the

406
00:37:03,457 --> 00:37:09,083
role. This was another actress that I was hating
on in the trailer because just like the weird

407
00:37:09,123 --> 00:37:13,706
line delivery that she gave when she was like,
Monty, I'm trying to... threaten some boys

408
00:37:13,847 --> 00:37:17,329
or something. I was like, this is so fucking
stupid. But then when you actually see it in

409
00:37:17,389 --> 00:37:22,313
context of who the character is, yeah, it looks
like she had a blast with the role. It was

410
00:37:22,373 --> 00:37:27,357
perfect casting. It's like she was born to play
that role. Exactly. Actually, I felt that way

411
00:37:27,377 --> 00:37:32,081
about most of the characters in this cast. Like
I'm sure I'll see a few of them in other roles

412
00:37:32,121 --> 00:37:36,384
down the line, but I'm always gonna remember
them for these specific roles because a lot

413
00:37:36,404 --> 00:37:42,201
of them are unknown to me. and they did such
a fantastic, iconic job with their performances.

414
00:37:42,341 --> 00:37:47,104
Cannot say enough good things about the cast.
Now Esther was a woman who turned to witchcraft

415
00:37:47,365 --> 00:37:53,049
to punish her cheating husband during the pioneering
days of America's Pacific coast. After being

416
00:37:53,169 --> 00:37:58,653
granted immortality by Lilith, the patron of
wronged women, Esther was forced to feed on

417
00:37:58,673 --> 00:38:03,197
the souls of young girls to her pet snake in
order to maintain her youth and beauty across

418
00:38:03,217 --> 00:38:09,104
the centuries. She's motivated by revenge against
the boys for rescuing a young girl that she

419
00:38:09,124 --> 00:38:14,666
was going to feed on. It takes a while for the
show to reveal her teeth-face mushroom monster

420
00:38:14,706 --> 00:38:20,509
plan, but I could see why due to the procedural
nature of the show. And despite the lack of

421
00:38:20,549 --> 00:38:26,351
reveal of her plan early on, she was still like
a credible threat whenever she appeared in

422
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:30,173
the background. Yeah, fantastic villain. I thought
they were, you know, over and done with her

423
00:38:30,233 --> 00:38:35,007
by episode one. And I thought even in the final
episode, she made for a fantastic climax. Yeah,

424
00:38:35,027 --> 00:38:39,708
she did. Like the way she beat the shit out
of the cat king, you know. Oh, there was any

425
00:38:39,948 --> 00:38:44,170
cast member I didn't like. It was probably the
cat king. He was just really sleazy. Yeah,

426
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:49,531
I could get that. I didn't want to like him.
But honestly, the actor also just nailed the

427
00:38:49,551 --> 00:38:55,113
performance in a way that didn't make it feel
as cheesy as it should have been. So I was

428
00:38:55,153 --> 00:38:56,673
just impressed by that fact alone.

436
00:39:51,494 --> 00:39:56,775
Moving on to the story highlights, the first
episode was called The Case of Crystal Palace.

437
00:39:57,316 --> 00:40:01,837
After British ghost detectives Edwin Payne and
Charles Rowland help a ghost soldier from World

438
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:06,978
War I cross into the afterlife, avoiding death
in the process, the duo takes on a new case

439
00:40:06,998 --> 00:40:12,740
to help a young demon-possessed amnesiac psychic
named Crystal Palace. After exorcising her

440
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,901
demon, Crystal convinces the friends to travel
with her to port towns in Washington in America.

441
00:40:18,262 --> 00:40:23,246
to find a missing girl named Becky that Crystal
psychically deduced was still alive after touching

442
00:40:23,286 --> 00:40:28,251
the boy's mail. After getting lodging above
a butcher shop, the trio learns that Becky

443
00:40:28,271 --> 00:40:34,137
is trapped in a witch's house. After a flashback
to Edwin's death in the 1910s, Edwin uses a

444
00:40:34,177 --> 00:40:39,362
magic string to trap a cat and learn more about
the witch, after which the trio makes a plan

445
00:40:39,382 --> 00:40:44,471
to break into her house. Before they escape
with Becky, The witch, named Esther Finch,

446
00:40:44,591 --> 00:40:49,855
confronts and injures them, forcing Charles
to possess her and rescue the team. After Becky

447
00:40:49,895 --> 00:40:54,318
is returned home, the Lost and Found department
in the Netherworld is notified of Charles'

448
00:40:54,438 --> 00:40:59,402
act of possession, bringing Kim and Edwin to
the attention of the Night Nurse. I will admit

449
00:40:59,442 --> 00:41:03,205
that the first episode I think was actually
my least favorite, even though it was really

450
00:41:03,225 --> 00:41:08,829
good and I was compelled to watch more. I think
it just had too much load to bear, basically.

451
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:14,330
We had to get through all these introductions
and whatnot. And while eventually the show

452
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:18,733
ended up getting its bearings starting in episode
two, when we started getting a more procedural

453
00:41:18,913 --> 00:41:23,697
formula for the show, it did kind of stumble
out of the gate, I think. But still good. I

454
00:41:23,737 --> 00:41:27,420
agree with you. But honestly, it was one of
my favorite episodes just because of how well

455
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:32,385
it set up the premise of the series, I guess.
Yeah, and it was successful in the setup. I'll

456
00:41:32,425 --> 00:41:37,829
say that, especially with the tone and the characters.
I guess it was less successful in terms of

457
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:44,040
plotting. as an individuel standalone piece.
I really liked the action of this first episode,

458
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:48,663
like right off the bat. You see Edwin and Charles
running from this World War One ghost, and

459
00:41:48,683 --> 00:41:52,445
they're like hopping through mirrors and like
casting spells and getting like blood dripped

460
00:41:52,485 --> 00:41:56,747
on them and stuff. I really enjoyed it. I also
really enjoyed seeing death. I was like, oh,

461
00:41:56,847 --> 00:42:03,171
shit, it's death from Sandman. It's Kirby. How
about East? She's too nice. I want to see her

462
00:42:03,211 --> 00:42:08,926
like get angry once, you know, dude, you like
never see that in the comics. Really? Yeah,

463
00:42:08,946 --> 00:42:14,969
that's too bad. Moving on to episode two, the
case of the Dandelion Shrine. As the trio attempts

464
00:42:15,009 --> 00:42:19,311
to leave Port Townsend, they're confronted by
a cluster of cats that take them to the Cat

465
00:42:19,331 --> 00:42:24,394
King, whose angry Edwin used magic on one of
his cats and traps him in Port Townsend with

466
00:42:24,414 --> 00:42:29,917
a magic bracelet. While the boys go to a shop
of magic artifacts owned by a man named Tragic

467
00:42:30,037 --> 00:42:35,700
Mick, Crystal encounters her new neighbor, a
young girl named Niko Saki, who's emitting

468
00:42:35,801 --> 00:42:41,179
colorful lights and faints. After Charles uses
a mirror to return to their detective office

469
00:42:41,419 --> 00:42:46,382
back in London to collect magical reference
books, the boys learn that parasitic dandelion

470
00:42:46,422 --> 00:42:51,765
sprites have infected Nico and she's in danger
of exploding. While following a map through

471
00:42:51,785 --> 00:42:56,347
the forest to where Nico was infected, the boys
learn that the sprites can be trapped in an

472
00:42:56,408 --> 00:43:02,071
enchanted vessel. Just before Nico explodes,
Crystal uses herself as bait for the sprites

473
00:43:02,111 --> 00:43:08,154
new host while Charles traps them in an enchanted
jar they procured from the magic shop. After

474
00:43:08,194 --> 00:43:13,156
the ordeal, Nico's hair turns white and her
near-death experience allows her to see ghosts,

475
00:43:13,577 --> 00:43:18,319
and the boy's ghost mailman informs them that
all the ghosts in town have heard about them.

476
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,623
Meanwhile, Esther turns her pet crow into a
human boy named Monty to seduce Edwin. I just

477
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:29,025
want to say that I love Nico. She was so fantastic
in this. We should all strive to be more like

478
00:43:29,105 --> 00:43:36,842
Nico and Charles because as far as I'm concerned,
they're the best people in fiction. She was

479
00:43:36,862 --> 00:43:41,403
fantastic, and while this case was probably
one of the least interesting cases out of the

480
00:43:41,443 --> 00:43:46,064
entire season, I think the actress is the one
who made it endearing. Yeah, absolutely. I

481
00:43:46,104 --> 00:43:51,306
agree with everything you said. What's interesting
is that Nico is an original character. She's

482
00:43:51,366 --> 00:43:56,907
not in the comics. So I think including her
is just a stroke of genius for the writers.

483
00:43:56,927 --> 00:44:02,289
I'm not surprised that she's an original character.
She just seems too unique and special to not

484
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:06,370
be conceived of on the spot in the making of
the show. I think one interesting thing they

485
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:12,213
did in this episode is trap the boys in this
town with the bracelet that Edwin is forced

486
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:18,617
to wear. It was a smart way to keep the show
cheap, I think. Yeah. Well, it did a lot of

487
00:44:18,637 --> 00:44:24,320
things. I mean, the whole trapping them there
addressed, you know, Edwin's burgeoning sexuality.

488
00:44:24,901 --> 00:44:30,784
It addressed a lot of their individuel character
arcs. It did things like made Nico a main character

489
00:44:31,204 --> 00:44:35,466
in this season. And Esther a villain. Yeah,
I was initially annoyed that they actually

490
00:44:35,486 --> 00:44:40,228
got trapped there because I think I wanted the
show to take place in London, but, you know,

491
00:44:40,268 --> 00:44:44,429
by the end I was perfectly happy with the setting.
Yeah, and who knows, maybe season two will

492
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:49,991
take place in London. Yeah. Episode three was
titled, The Case of the Devlin House. After

493
00:44:50,031 --> 00:44:54,392
meeting with dozens of ghosts, the boys decide
to accept a case involving a grisly murder

494
00:44:54,452 --> 00:44:59,734
slash suicide that happened in a neighborhood
house a couple of decades prior. After learning

495
00:44:59,854 --> 00:45:04,555
more about the notorious Devlin murders from
Jenny the Butcher and the library, Edwin and

496
00:45:04,575 --> 00:45:09,416
Nico meet Monty, while the night nurse is prevented
from going to find the boys on the mortal plane

497
00:45:09,476 --> 00:45:14,938
due to afterlife bureaucracy and red tape. While
visiting the Devlin house hours before it's

498
00:45:14,958 --> 00:45:19,599
scheduled to be demolished, Crystal and the
boys witness a repeated loop of the ghosts

499
00:45:19,939 --> 00:45:25,461
of the Devlin family reliving their grisly deaths
at the hands of their father. Emotionally traumatized,

500
00:45:25,741 --> 00:45:30,902
Charles attempts to stop the father. but gets
stuck in the loop as well. After discovering

501
00:45:31,002 --> 00:45:36,644
a VHS recording of the murders in a hidden room
in the house, Edwin manages to erase the tape

502
00:45:36,684 --> 00:45:42,105
while Crystal is meanwhile tormented by David,
her former love interest and a demon. With

503
00:45:42,125 --> 00:45:46,927
the tape erased, the Devlin ghosts are able
to move into the afterlife, and Charles becomes

504
00:45:47,047 --> 00:45:52,088
unstuck from the loop. While Monty meets up
with Edwin once again, the Night Nurse learns

505
00:45:52,188 --> 00:45:57,858
the location of the boys from the Devlin children.
Now, like Charles, And I guess all three of

506
00:45:57,878 --> 00:46:02,801
them, this was kind of a hard episode to watch.
It was it was horrifying. Yeah, I mean, you

507
00:46:02,821 --> 00:46:07,663
see repeatedly the father murder his wife and
daughters with an axe. It's definitely TVMA,

508
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:13,687
right? But there's this almost not a true crime
appeal, but it's the same kind of appeal where

509
00:46:13,707 --> 00:46:18,589
you see these horrific things being brought
to justice. Yeah, true. Yeah. Am I the only

510
00:46:18,649 --> 00:46:22,792
one that was super annoyed by Monty? Yeah, he's
probably my least favorite character in the

511
00:46:22,832 --> 00:46:28,467
whole show. I think he's kind of supposed to
be. supposed to get on people's nerves and

512
00:46:28,487 --> 00:46:33,132
then kind of redeem himself in the end. And
I think he did kind of become this tragic figure.

513
00:46:33,192 --> 00:46:38,137
But until he got there, I was just super annoyed
by the kid. Like, I didn't want to see him.

514
00:46:38,697 --> 00:46:43,242
He was dumb. I think it was partly because of
how uncomfortable he made Edwin as well. That

515
00:46:43,282 --> 00:46:49,007
just bothered me a little too. He was like so
forward with him when Edwin was uncomfortable

516
00:46:49,107 --> 00:46:54,180
with who he was necessarily at that point. Exactly,
yet you saw how uncomfortable Edwin was with

517
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:58,563
the cat king, and to see some other character
just kind of being real pushy in that regard

518
00:46:58,703 --> 00:47:03,087
just made you want him to go away. Moving on
to episode 4, which was called The Case of

519
00:47:03,127 --> 00:47:07,651
the Lighthouse Leapers. After Crystal and Nico
question Jenny about anonymous love letters

520
00:47:07,831 --> 00:47:13,155
she's receiving, a ghost lightkeeper arrives
and requests their services to help stop people

521
00:47:13,195 --> 00:47:17,659
from jumping off of his lighthouse. Crystal,
Nico, and the boys arrive at the lighthouse

522
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:22,254
just in time to see a woman jump from the top
and become a ghost. insisting she heard from

523
00:47:22,274 --> 00:47:27,076
a loved one that told her to jump. While several
other ghosts tell Charles and Crystal the same

524
00:47:27,116 --> 00:47:31,918
thing, and Crystal nearly succumbs to jumping
herself after hearing her mother's voice call

525
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:37,221
to her, Edwin is visited by the King of Cats
who accuses Edwin of having romantic feelings

526
00:47:37,241 --> 00:47:42,663
for Charles, and Nico learns in a nearby gift
shop of the local legend of the Washer Woman,

527
00:47:42,803 --> 00:47:48,266
who lends guidance to those in need. Nico finds
a red shard of sea glass on the shore, allowing

528
00:47:48,286 --> 00:47:52,748
them to meet with the washerwoman who tells
them the Jumpers are being lured to their deaths

529
00:47:53,008 --> 00:47:58,990
by a sea monster. While Night Nurse confronts
Jenny about the location of Crystal, she, Nico,

530
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:03,872
and the boys visit Tragic Mix's shop, who informs
them that their monster sounds like a giant

531
00:48:03,972 --> 00:48:09,435
anglerfish named Angie and sells them a musical
device that will put her to sleep. After getting

532
00:48:09,535 --> 00:48:14,457
meat from the butcher to use as bait, the group
returns to the lighthouse where they are confronted

533
00:48:14,537 --> 00:48:19,497
by the Night Nurse. who torments Charles with
visions of how he was bullied, abused, and

534
00:48:19,577 --> 00:48:25,062
killed. Enraged, Charles beats Night Nurse with
the musical device, knocking her into the sea

535
00:48:25,082 --> 00:48:30,687
where she's swallowed up by Angie, who leaves
the lighthouse. Back home, Charles and Crystal

536
00:48:30,727 --> 00:48:35,712
share a kiss. This was actually probably my
favorite episode because we finally got a chance

537
00:48:35,732 --> 00:48:41,097
to see Charles' origin. And though it was tragic,
it kind of cemented Charles as my favorite

538
00:48:41,117 --> 00:48:44,522
character of the show. Yeah, he was probably
my favorite character of the show too. This

539
00:48:44,562 --> 00:48:48,083
was a fantastic episode. The latter half was
definitely better than the first half. The

540
00:48:48,123 --> 00:48:52,285
first half posed a lot of questions that never
really quite get answered throughout the rest

541
00:48:52,325 --> 00:48:57,146
of the season, such as who is the gift shop
owner? What's the deal with the riddle talking,

542
00:48:57,186 --> 00:49:01,667
washing woman? How the hell does Anglerfish
get that big and nobody notices things like

543
00:49:01,687 --> 00:49:06,389
that? I think it was a supernatural anglerfish.
Sea monster. Obviously. I don't think it was

544
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:12,711
a real anglerfish, Joseph. But yeah, the latter
half of the episode was actually extremely

545
00:49:12,771 --> 00:49:16,794
powerful. And then you got that kiss at the
end, which felt like an oh shit moment because

546
00:49:16,814 --> 00:49:21,998
you knew all the emotional stakes that were
going around. Right, exactly. Episode 5 was

547
00:49:22,038 --> 00:49:26,801
titled The Case of the Two Dead Dragons. While
the boys are approached by the ghosts of two

548
00:49:26,841 --> 00:49:31,424
murdered high school jocks to find out who murdered
them, Nico identifies Jenny's anonymous love

549
00:49:31,464 --> 00:49:36,848
letter scribe as the local librarian, Lindsay.
After investigating the area in the woods where

550
00:49:36,868 --> 00:49:41,475
the jocks' bodies were found and finding nothing,
Crystal and the boys visit the local high school

551
00:49:41,495 --> 00:49:46,258
in disguise to question the students. There,
they are directed by a boy named Richie, who

552
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:51,402
is bullied by the Jocks, and informs them that
one of the Jocks' ex-girlfriends, Shelby, killed

553
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:56,706
herself months after the Jocks were found dead.
After using a spell to summon Shelby's ghost,

554
00:49:57,026 --> 00:50:01,450
Shelby tells them that the Jocks were jerks
who ruined her life. When Crystal gets a phone

555
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:05,753
call from Marin, one of the Jocks' girlfriends
at the time of their death, Crystal goes to

556
00:50:05,813 --> 00:50:10,079
visit her house. where the boys deduce that
Marin was the one who poisoned and killed the

557
00:50:10,119 --> 00:50:15,721
jocks and was about to kill Crystal as well.
When confronted, Marin confesses to poisoning

558
00:50:15,761 --> 00:50:19,823
the jocks after they threaten to send nude photos
of her to everyone on their football team.

559
00:50:20,203 --> 00:50:25,005
While Marin turns herself into the police, Jenny
has dinner with Lindsay at the butcher shop,

560
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:29,827
only to learn that Lindsay has been stalking
her at night. When Lindsay is asked to leave,

561
00:50:29,847 --> 00:50:35,546
she becomes violent, but slips and dies via
brain impalement while attacking Jenny. After

562
00:50:35,566 --> 00:50:40,731
the jocks learn who killed them, they cross
over into Hell, and Crystal is once again tormented

563
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:46,936
by David. When Monty kisses Edwin, Edwin confesses
that he has feelings for someone else. This

564
00:50:46,956 --> 00:50:51,520
was actually probably my least favorite episode,
and I think a lot of it has to do with just

565
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:57,746
the jocks being jerks. Yeah, the jocks were
assholes. They deserved to burn in Hell. That

566
00:50:57,766 --> 00:51:00,689
was actually a pretty cool special effect when
they got dragged there. I actually really liked

567
00:51:00,729 --> 00:51:05,355
this episode. To me, one of the things that
sticks out in my mind most when thinking about

568
00:51:05,415 --> 00:51:11,859
the show overall is how uncomfortable the scene
was between the stalker librarian chick and

569
00:51:11,939 --> 00:51:18,443
the butcher lady when the librarian mentioned
that she thought she was so cute in her pajama

570
00:51:18,583 --> 00:51:24,046
oversized t-shirt. And just that moment, that
like, oh, shit moment. And then like just fucking

571
00:51:24,066 --> 00:51:28,388
went crazy. Like I know this whole scene had
no bearing on the season as a whole, but it

572
00:51:28,408 --> 00:51:33,670
was my favorite like side plot by far. just
because how fucking bonkers it was. Like she

573
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:37,871
started chasing her with a butcher knife and
then she fucking tripped and fell onto a spike.

574
00:51:38,191 --> 00:51:43,213
Holy shit, man. My jaw was on the floor. Yeah,
I agree. Like this was definitely my favorite

575
00:51:43,253 --> 00:51:48,114
part of an episode that I didn't really care
for. The actresses just totally pulled off

576
00:51:48,234 --> 00:51:54,256
everything. Again, the cast, so good. Even minor
characters like the librarian. Right, believable

577
00:51:54,316 --> 00:51:59,297
as a total psycho all of a sudden. Totally,
totally. Episode six was titled, The Case of

578
00:51:59,337 --> 00:52:04,114
the Creeping Forest. When Crystal and Niko visit
Tragic Mick to find something that will get

579
00:52:04,154 --> 00:52:08,996
David out of Crystal's mind, they learn about
Mick's past as a walrus before they're given

580
00:52:09,036 --> 00:52:14,537
an artifact known as the Light of Heart, which,
when used, causes Crystal to accidentally remove

581
00:52:14,557 --> 00:52:20,199
her powers of psychic insight as well. After
Esther grows a magic mushroom, she orders Monty

582
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:25,960
to lure Crystal and the boys into the forest,
where her trap awaits. Making up a story about

583
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,318
a missing ghost friend named Gladys, Monty successfully
gets them into the forest, where they find

584
00:52:31,378 --> 00:52:37,201
traces of ghost fungus, which is deadly to ghosts.
Despite Edwin developing a formula to kill

585
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:41,804
the fungus, it continues to grow and the boys
realize it's coming from an interdimensional

586
00:52:41,844 --> 00:52:46,747
creature. When the team splits up to locate
the creature, Edwin and Crystal are attacked

587
00:52:46,767 --> 00:52:53,111
by David, but manage to defeat him. Monty, despite
still being hurt over Edwin's unrequited feelings,

588
00:52:53,391 --> 00:52:58,202
has a change of heart and attempts to get Edwin
out of the forest and Esther's trap. but not

589
00:52:58,222 --> 00:53:03,166
before the Cat King appears, who outs Moti as
Esther's crow and reveals the boys are falling

590
00:53:03,226 --> 00:53:09,211
into a trap set up by Esther. Moti leaves in
shame only to run into Esther who kills and

591
00:53:09,251 --> 00:53:14,515
converts him back into a crow. Just as Edwin
finds Charles and Crystal to warn them of Esther's

592
00:53:14,555 --> 00:53:21,020
trap, Esther attacks with her mushroom creature,
Teeth Face, who attempts to eat the boys. Meanwhile,

593
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:26,525
Crystal discovers within her the magic spirits
of her ancestors, reawakening her psychic powers

594
00:53:26,645 --> 00:53:32,245
and then some. which allows her to defeat Teethface
and Esther, burying them both in the forest

595
00:53:32,345 --> 00:53:37,610
and saving the boys. Back home, Night Nurse
finds the boys and threatens to take them into

596
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:43,515
the afterlife when suddenly a demon erupts from
hell and steals Edwin, who loses the Cat King's

597
00:53:43,555 --> 00:53:48,178
bracelet in the process. This was a great episode
except for one thing, and it was actually my

598
00:53:48,238 --> 00:53:53,203
least favorite moment of the entire season.
And it was when Crystal defeated the fungus

599
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:57,610
monster. She basically stuck her hands into
the ground and was like... Hey, leave them

600
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:01,771
alone. And the monster was like, oops, sorry.
And then like left. It was like, it couldn't

601
00:54:01,791 --> 00:54:07,113
have been that simple. I understand that it
was, I guess, supposed to be this great psychic

602
00:54:07,193 --> 00:54:14,315
feat or whatnot. But to have the mushroom monster
just kind of like apologize and leave undersold

603
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:19,997
the stakes that I think it was supposed to pose.
Yeah, it was pretty anticlimactic. I'll agree

604
00:54:20,017 --> 00:54:26,832
with that. But I also liked the original aspect
of Crystal and how she was a descendant of

605
00:54:26,852 --> 00:54:31,174
this ancient line of sorceresses. I almost got
the impression that she was a descendant of

606
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:36,876
Lilith herself, though I may just be making
that up. It felt very Black Panther, you know,

607
00:54:37,076 --> 00:54:42,819
on the ancestral plane. Okay, Black Panther
does not have a monopoly on African culture,

608
00:54:42,939 --> 00:54:47,841
my friend. Well, that seemed like it was Jamaican
culture, but the purple tree and everything,

609
00:54:47,961 --> 00:54:54,670
come on. I liked this episode overall. It definitely
had the most shocking moment to me when all

610
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:58,653
of a sudden at the very end of this episode,
a demon snatches Edwin to go back to hell.

611
00:54:58,693 --> 00:55:03,657
I was like, holy shit, next episode, next episode.
Yeah, that was horrifying. The next episode,

612
00:55:03,737 --> 00:55:09,182
episode seven, was titled The Case of the Very
Long Stairway. Now Esther emerges from the

613
00:55:09,202 --> 00:55:14,386
ground pissed and confronts the cat king about
revealing her trap, beating him to death and

614
00:55:14,406 --> 00:55:19,770
taking one of his nine lives. In the process,
she learns that Edwin is in hell, but has escaped

615
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:25,055
before, which inspires a new plan for Esther.
Meanwhile, Charles pleads with Night Nurse

616
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:30,019
to open a portal to Hell for him to save Edwin,
and after seeing how the two boys first met,

617
00:55:30,399 --> 00:55:36,124
Night Nurse is moved into helping Charles. Using
Edwin's notes, Charles navigates Hell, while

618
00:55:36,224 --> 00:55:41,269
Edwin finds one of the boys who killed him and
despair of the Endless. Crystal meanwhile seeks

619
00:55:41,329 --> 00:55:45,833
out her demon ex-boyfriend for her own way into
Hell to help Edwin after Charles refused to

620
00:55:45,993 --> 00:55:50,679
let her come with him. Jenny follows Crystal,
however, and she ends up being possessed by

621
00:55:50,759 --> 00:55:56,362
David, who then attacks Crystal, though Crystal
easily overcomes him. As Esther visits Tragic

622
00:55:56,402 --> 00:56:01,624
Mic for parts to a device that will torture
Edwin and convert his pain into power, Charles

623
00:56:01,664 --> 00:56:06,887
finds Edwin in Hell and the two manage to escape,
with Edwin confessing his love for Charles

624
00:56:07,227 --> 00:56:11,949
and Charles responding that though Edwin is
his very best friend, he's not in love with

625
00:56:11,989 --> 00:56:17,062
him back. The two continue into the living world
amicably, and before Night Nurse can take the

626
00:56:17,102 --> 00:56:21,706
two into the afterlife, Nico points out that
Night Nurse needs to fill out a specific form

627
00:56:21,986 --> 00:56:27,312
before she can transfer the boys into the afterlife.
Angry, Night Nurse promises to come back for

628
00:56:27,332 --> 00:56:32,777
them before Crystal, having obtained her memories
back from David in the form of marbles, swallows

629
00:56:32,897 --> 00:56:37,718
one to regain her memory. This is my favorite
episode. It was by far the best- It was so

630
00:56:37,758 --> 00:56:41,699
good, it could have been the season finale.
Everything about it was executed really well,

631
00:56:41,779 --> 00:56:47,262
especially the unique depiction of hell that
we got here. It was just horrifying, but in

632
00:56:47,322 --> 00:56:52,644
its own quirky dead boy detective's way, I think.
Yeah, like the different levels where people

633
00:56:52,684 --> 00:56:59,006
were being punished for their various vices
felt very like Dante's Inferno, but you're

634
00:56:59,026 --> 00:57:03,888
right, in a very different, kind of more modern,
quirky way. The fact that Charles really didn't

635
00:57:03,948 --> 00:57:10,337
experience it until he was getting Charles out,
felt very much like a haunted house of sorts.

636
00:57:10,878 --> 00:57:15,843
And it was just creepy. One of the best things
I think about this episode was that it kind

637
00:57:15,883 --> 00:57:20,988
of subverted expectations as far as formula
goes, because my expectation was that Crystal

638
00:57:21,028 --> 00:57:25,213
was going to find another route into hell and
she was gonna rescue the boys out of hell.

639
00:57:25,393 --> 00:57:29,297
And Charles was gonna be proven wrong that he
didn't need her to help Edwin. But Crystal's

640
00:57:29,337 --> 00:57:33,683
demon. didn't have a way into Hell. And so she
had this own little arc on her own where she

641
00:57:33,723 --> 00:57:37,184
actually tapped into her full potential and
got her memories back and everything on her

642
00:57:37,325 --> 00:57:42,126
own and had nothing to do with the Hell adventure.
And I'm kind of glad it turned out that way

643
00:57:42,146 --> 00:57:46,968
because it was nice that the boys had time to
themselves. And it was also good that Crystal

644
00:57:47,048 --> 00:57:52,331
had that as well for her to kind of face David
without the help from the boys. Right, yeah,

645
00:57:52,351 --> 00:57:57,193
I made them a stronger characters individuelly.
Absolutely. In the final episode, episode eight

646
00:57:57,333 --> 00:58:03,276
titled The Case of the Hungry Snake, After remembering
her past crimes and abuses of power, Crystal

647
00:58:03,316 --> 00:58:08,020
calls her parents to check in, only to learn
they didn't even realize she was gone. After

648
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:12,924
Esther finishes and tests her pain-to-power
generator, Crystal and Nico reveal to Jenny

649
00:58:13,205 --> 00:58:17,448
that she had been possessed and introduced her
to the world of the paranormal. When Crystal

650
00:58:17,488 --> 00:58:22,332
starts off to leave the team, Esther bombs Jenny's
butcher shop with magic and binds Edwin and

651
00:58:22,372 --> 00:58:27,776
Charles' souls into lanterns. Crystal returns
and together with Nico, visits the Cat King

652
00:58:27,816 --> 00:58:32,883
to learn of Esther's past, including a pact
she made with Lilith for immortality, and her

653
00:58:32,923 --> 00:58:38,504
weaknesses, which includes black salt, which
they get from Tragic Mick. As Esther activates

654
00:58:38,524 --> 00:58:44,086
her machine, consuming large quantities of power,
Crystal and Nico sneak into her house and help

655
00:58:44,106 --> 00:58:49,107
Charles escape from his iron shackles in order
to kill Esther's pet snake, which keeps her

656
00:58:49,167 --> 00:58:54,949
young. Crystal and Nico, meanwhile, attack Esther
head on, though Esther manages to kill Nico.

657
00:58:55,329 --> 00:59:00,063
When Crystal reaches into Esther's mind, She
convinces Lilith to rescind her bestowal of

658
00:59:00,163 --> 00:59:06,005
immortality on Esther. After Charles successfully
kills the snake, Esther rapidly ages and is

659
00:59:06,045 --> 00:59:10,827
carried off by Lilith for the harm she had done
to young girls. After agreeing to have Crystal

660
00:59:10,867 --> 00:59:15,509
stay on as a teammate and saying goodbye to
Jenny and the Cat King, the boys return to

661
00:59:15,529 --> 00:59:20,572
their London office only to be confronted by
the Night Nurse and her supervisor, who recognizes

662
00:59:20,612 --> 00:59:25,526
the dead boy detective's beneficial work helping
ghosts receive closure and cross over. and

663
00:59:25,546 --> 00:59:30,249
she transfers Night Nurse to Earth to oversee
the boys' work. Before the final end credits,

664
00:59:30,289 --> 00:59:35,753
we see a hidden figure and an igloo with the
dandelion sprites holding a lucky charm that

665
00:59:35,773 --> 00:59:41,097
had been owned by Nico. Just when I thought
that the story had nowhere really to go after

666
00:59:41,137 --> 00:59:44,719
the previous episode, which was so good that
I said it could have been the season finale,

667
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:51,144
the show goes and wows me with everything that
happened in the final episode. Moments like

668
00:59:51,324 --> 00:59:57,050
the butcher shop getting blown up, fun moments
like Nico and Crystal speaking with the cat

669
00:59:57,070 --> 01:00:02,272
king and moments like Nico dying. There was
just so much that this last episode delivered

670
01:00:02,352 --> 01:00:07,674
on and I was really pleased with it. Yeah, it
was nice to see them combat Esther in a way

671
01:00:07,694 --> 01:00:13,195
that was much less anticlimactic than the whole
mushroom bit. Yeah. It was very much like a

672
01:00:13,255 --> 01:00:18,797
bare-knuckle brawl with magic. It was gritty
like that, which was pretty cool. And yeah,

673
01:00:18,837 --> 01:00:24,439
I'm really happy with how the show ended. I'm...
excited for a second season. I hope we get

674
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:29,501
one. I really hope we do too. I have no idea
how the show is performing on Netflix, but

675
01:00:29,701 --> 01:00:33,323
I'm sure it has a wide audience. I just hope
it reaches them. Yeah, I'm kind of nervous

676
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:38,225
about it because it was in the top 10 Netflix
television series for a couple of days, but

677
01:00:38,245 --> 01:00:43,548
then it like completely fell out of the top
10. I'm really hoping that word of mouth spreads

678
01:00:43,608 --> 01:00:47,229
and more people watch it because I think it's
worth watching and I think it's worth the season

679
01:00:47,249 --> 01:00:52,148
too. It's getting good reviews, not only by
us, but by a lot of the critics on Rotten Tomatoes.

680
01:00:52,548 --> 01:00:55,010
Well, you don't know how I'm going to review
this. You don't know a score I'm going to give

681
01:00:55,070 --> 01:01:01,914
it. OK, all right. I'm pretty sure it's going
to be a good score. Yeah, I mean, I can't lie.

682
01:01:01,974 --> 01:01:07,677
It's a terrific show. You know, it's charismatic
cast and offbeat charm made for a whimsical

683
01:01:07,737 --> 01:01:12,860
mystery horror series and a frighteningly good
addition to the Sandman television universe.

684
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:19,992
I'm giving it four out of five stars. a fresh
rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It's not perfect.

685
01:01:20,132 --> 01:01:25,156
There were, as I mentioned, some superfluous
characters and subplots that were never resolved,

686
01:01:25,536 --> 01:01:30,119
but overall I had a blast with the show. It's
like my cup of tea. Two a tea. In the same

687
01:01:30,139 --> 01:01:34,682
way that Doom Patrol was. Yeah, I would agree
that this season was not quite as good as Sandman

688
01:01:34,702 --> 01:01:38,885
season one, but you know, just below that and
a really enjoyable time. I'm really hoping

689
01:01:38,925 --> 01:01:43,728
we see these characters again, whether it be
in season two of the Sandman series or, you

690
01:01:43,748 --> 01:01:47,550
know, a second season of this show. The best
thing that I can say about it is that, kind

691
01:01:47,590 --> 01:01:51,931
of like my adventures with Superman, how I was
not excited to review that show and then ended

692
01:01:51,971 --> 01:01:56,192
up being completely blown away by it, I feel
the same way about Dead Boy Detective Season

693
01:01:56,272 --> 01:02:01,734
1. Yeah, I'm glad you saw the light. I'm glad
that DC stuff is impressing you. Yeah, DC's

694
01:02:01,754 --> 01:02:05,255
been killing it with their television series
lately, for sure. I don't know what to say

695
01:02:05,295 --> 01:02:08,996
to that. Why are you being so nice? It costs
nothing to pay a compliment. I still in my

696
01:02:09,036 --> 01:02:12,957
heart know that Marvel's better in every way.
It's just that Charles and Nico have robed

697
01:02:13,017 --> 01:02:17,498
off on you. I get it. I see. I strive to be
more like Charles in my daily life, so here's

698
01:02:17,518 --> 01:02:22,581
me starting to do that. Awesome. Well, that
