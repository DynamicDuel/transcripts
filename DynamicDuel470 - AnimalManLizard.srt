00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,660
This is a DynaMic Network podcast. Hi and welcome
to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,140
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,620
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe and I'm his twin

4
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:44,180
brother Johnny DC. As you guys probably know, that
was not actually Johnny DC, that was me squeezing

5
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:50,020
my nostrils. Johnny DC will be out for the first
part of this episode because he is busy getting a

6
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:55,800
procedure done, and in case that sounds vague,
Jonathan got a kidney stone, which is super

7
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,980
painful, really wishing him the best here. It was
apparently too large to pass so they had to use a

8
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:08,280
laser and basically play asteroids with the thing
up in his kidney. Not a great time. I don't know how

9
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:14,840
one gets kidney stones, I think it's largely a
dehydration thing, but since I am also usually

10
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,520
dehydrated and I've never gotten kidney stones, I
can only assume that one actually gets kidney

11
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,920
stones from liking DC. So, public service
announcement to all the DC fans out there, just

12
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,100
switch to Marvel and you won't get kidney stones.
In this episode, Jonathan is going to be joining me

13
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:36,300
as we find out who's going to win in a fight between
Animal Man vs. The Lizard. And I'm feeling pretty

14
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,420
good about this one. The Lizard is one of
Spider-Man's most formidable foes and I think

15
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,360
he's going to be really impressive statistically
going up against Animal Man, who is probably a

16
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,160
lesser known DC character, but has kind of like a
cult following. He's able to tap into the

17
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,320
abilities of all animals. We'll see who wins later
on this episode. Before that, I'm going to break

18
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,400
down the latest comic book movie news that has come
out over the past month since we haven't really

19
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,800
gotten to the news in a few weeks due to the holiday
season. But there are two important things to talk

20
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:10,020
about including the fact that Brainiac has been
cast in the Man of Tomorrow movie and we got an

21
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,780
official trailer for the Wonder Man series. As
always guys, we list our segment times in our

22
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,960
episode description so feel free to check out the
show notes if you want to skip ahead to a particular

23
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:23,560
topic. Our artificially intelligent Duel
simulator AJ9K has a quick message for our

24
00:02:23,560 --> 00:03:03,520
listeners, so listen up. Hello. These are the final

Podcast Network this week including the Konsole

28
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,860
Kombat Podcast where hosts John and Dean simulate
battles between popular video game characters.

29
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:37,460
They are actually doing a tribute to Dynamic Duel
by doing a DC vs Marvel themed month. So in

30
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:42,700
yesterday's episode, they found out who would win
between Deadpool from the Deadpool video game and

31
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:48,060
Lobo from Injustice. That sounds like a good one,
go check that out. Also check out the Max

32
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,440
Destruction Podcast where hosts Scotty and Gilly
pit your favorite action heroes from film and

33
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,700
television against each other. The Macho Twins
this month are also doing a tribute to Dynamic Duel

34
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,900
with the DC vs Marvel theme. They're going to find
out who would win in a fight between the MCU's Agent

35
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:09,080
Coulson and the Arrow vs John Diggle. That'll be on
Wednesday. And on the Senjoh World Podcast hosts

36
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,560
Zachary Hepburn speculates on fights between fan
favorite anime and manga characters. This month

37
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:19,339
Zach is revealing who would win between Mob from
Mob Psycho 100 and the tornado of terror from One

38
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:24,760
Punch Man. Visit DynamicPodcasts.com or click

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:35,480
in the DynaMic Podcast Network. But now that
that's done, onto the news! Alright in the first

40
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:41,540
bit of news we learned a few weeks ago that Brainiac
has been cast in the Superman sequel which is

41
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:47,700
titled Man of Tomorrow. The person playing
Brainiac chosen by James Gunn for the film will be,

42
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:57,020
let me check my notes here, Lars Eidinger, which of
course everybody knows who that guy is. He was in

43
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:05,020
Clouds of Sils Maria, obviously, and a movie
called Persian Lessons. Now I'm going to be

44
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:12,320
honest, I have no idea who this guy is and I don't
think Jonathan does either. He is a German actor

45
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:19,060
who I will say does not not look the part.
Apparently he did really well in his audition for

46
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,640
the film. Now I'm not the DC guy on this podcast so I
don't know if you guys want to hear my opinion, but I

47
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,620
don't think he's going to bring in any box office
dollars because he has no name recognition and I

48
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,340
think that James Gunn is really banking on the
characters selling the movie as opposed to the

49
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:39,680
actors themselves. Really David Cornsoit wasn't
a huge name either when he was cast as Superman. And

50
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,420
also I'm not really sure if a name actor is
necessary for Brainiac considering the level of

51
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,700
potential prosthetics or special effects that
will be applied to his performance. We don't know

52
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:55,100
if they're going to go the green skinned alien
route or the artificial intelligence route. So I

53
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,860
can see this role going anywhere from live action
performance to maybe just a voice role. We'll see

54
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:05,060
what happens. I will say that this casting
announcement drums up little to no excitement

55
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,140
though. Doesn't mean he'll be bad. We'll have a
better idea of what we're expecting from him once

56
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,220
we get trailers and other marketing material, but
that won't be for a while considering the movie

57
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,600
doesn't come out until summer of 2027. In other
bigger and better news, we got an official trailer

58
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:24,780
for the upcoming Wonder Man series starting Ya Ya
Abdul Mateen II and Ben Kingsley. The upcoming

59
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:30,220
series looks like a whole lot of fun. Absolutely
nothing like the comic books. I do appreciate the

60
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,720
angle that they're taking with the show though,
especially considering that Wonder Man was

61
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,480
always unique within the larger superhero
community as being one of the only superheroes who

62
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:45,580
was also an actor. It appears Marvel Studios has
taken that concept and run with it, making Wonder

63
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:51,580
Man more of a role that Simon Williams is pursuing
as opposed to an outright hero and member of the

64
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:57,100
Avengers. While it does take away from who the
character is on the page, I do think it provides a

65
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,460
unique opportunity for originality and
commentary on the state of superhero cinema in

66
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,860
general. They even mentioned within the course of
this trailer that Wonder Man is here to battle

67
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:12,680
superhero fatigue, which is in reference to the
dwindling box office returns of superhero

68
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:18,800
theatrical releases, at least compared to a
pre-COVID era. Simon Williams wants to play the

69
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,680
Wonder Man character in a movie that will be a
reboot of a Flash Gordon-esque series that aired

70
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:31,580
within the MCU, the twist being that Simon
Williams himself has superpowers. I don't know

71
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,560
how they're going to treat the origin of Simon
Williams because in the comic books of course

72
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:41,600
Wonder Man was a rival to Tony Stark, who was
recruited by Baron Zemo into the Masters of Evil

73
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,840
team who were the enemies of the Avengers, and
Simon was bombarded with ionic energy, making him

74
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,280
super durable, super strong. You can learn more
about Wonder Man in our Duel episode where we pay

75
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,520
him against Captain Adam, that was a fun one. But
this trailer doesn't give any sort of indication

76
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:03,880
that Yaya Abdul Mateen II's character is in fact a
rival to Tony Stark. So I'm guessing he gets his

77
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:07,960
ionic superpowers some other way. I don't know if
they're going to make him a mutant, but I'm hoping

78
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,700
that at least his origin involves Baron Zemo in
some capacity, and that his powers are ionic in

79
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,920
nature, otherwise the similarities to the comic
book version of Wonder Man will be too few.

80
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:22,560
Regardless of how they figure that out, what I'm
really looking forward to in the show are really

81
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,800
the performances of Yaya Abdul Mateen II. I've
been a big fan of his, of course he was in the Aquaman

82
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:33,220
movies, he was in the Watchman HBO television
series. I'm also a big fan of Ben Kingsley's Trevor

83
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:38,020
Slattery, even though I still despise what they
did with the character in Iron Man 3. I like how they

84
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,360
kind of developed him over the course of Shang-Chi
and now this show. I'll definitely be checking it

85
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:55,280
out when the show premieres on January 27th, just a
few weeks from now. But enough of me just blabbing

86
00:08:55,280 --> 00:09:00,300
on in a room by myself. I gotta say doing this is
really hard without a co-host, so let's get

87
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,380
Jonathan on the line. Hopefully he's feeling
better and we'll get this duel started and learn

88
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:25,820
who would win in a fight between Animal Man and the
Lizard. Alright Jonathan, welcome to the show.

89
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:31,140
Glad you could join us. How are you feeling? I'm
doing well for the most part. My throat is kind of

90
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:38,180
gone right now after the forced projectile
vomiting after coming out of anesthesia. So I hate

91
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:43,960
talking. I'm not loving that I'm talking right
now, but I do it for the fans. You know, even though

92
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:49,300
we only have two episodes left before our
semi-retirement, it does seem like you're trying

93
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:54,420
your damnace to make sure that we break our perfect
streak over the past decade. Hey, I've been here

94
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:01,220
for every episode. My guy, have you? No, that's
fair. Exactly. I did miss an episode when my

95
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:07,620
daughter was born. Priorities. Yeah, I can't
believe I did that. But as you know, in this

96
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:12,680
episode, we're going to find out who would win in a
fight between Animal Man and the Lizard. And it's

97
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:18,620
really going to suck because not only did you get PP
Lazard, but you're also going to lose this match.

98
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:22,560
So it's like kind of kicking you in the nuts when
you've already been repeatedly kicked in the

99
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,920
nuts. I don't know what makes you so confident.
Like, to me, this is another Vixen Craven matchup.

100
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,100
Who won that one? Craven. Oh, shit. I think. But it
was a coin toss. He only won 502 out of a thousand

101
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,340
matches. Oh, wow. Well, here's where I'm coming
from. I don't think there's anything the Lizard

102
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:45,760
can do that Animal Man can't. So I think you're the
one who is in fact going to have their PP kicked in.

103
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,400
Well, that's just not true. There are things that
Lizard can do that Animal Man can't. Or at least I

104
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,320
don't think he can. And I'll tell you what those
things are as we get into our backgrounds. Also,

105
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,520
the Lizard has been in a movie, two movies, whereas
Animal Man has not. So Lizard's just better in

106
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,980
general. I think Animal Man was in Teen Titans go to
the movies. Cool. First to explain the

107
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:12,280
methodology behind our duels, let's go to our
sentient Duel simulator Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K

108
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:18,040
tell our listeners how you go about determining a
winner in our Duel matchups. Yes, of course, sir.

109
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:21,960
The way I determine a winner between the
contestants is by running 1000 Monte Carlo

110
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,380
simulations using the characters statistics. A
Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic model

111
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:32,100
used to determine outcomes through random
sampling. In this case, I randomize the

112
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,040
statistics along a normal distribution as a way to
simulate the many variables that can occur during

113
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,980
battle. The stat parameters are based on the
official Marvel power grid from which the DC

114
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,640
characters statistics are extrapolated.
Additional stat categories are included such as

115
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,160
range, damage potential, versatility and
perception in order to create a more detailed and

116
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,520
accurate simulation. The results of the 1000
simulations provide a percentage of wins for each

117
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:02,100
character. The contestant with the higher
percentage is declared the victor as they have a

118
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,400
higher probability to win any given battle. In an
equitable pairing, neither character should win

119
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,740
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat

120
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,200
Superman, so the confidence rate of my method
falls in line with the precedents that have been

121
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,040
established in the source material. My
mathematical simulations are without

122
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,620
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for

123
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:31,920
determination of the winner. Thanks AJ9K. Before
we run the simulations though, we'd like to break

124
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,400
down each character's histories and abilities
before improvising a scenario on how we imagined

125
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:41,800
one of the 1000 simulations would play out beat for
beat. And it is my turn to go first with the Marvel

126
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,460
character backstory, so let me tell you all about
the lizard. Kurt Connors was born in Coral Gables,

127
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,520
Florida and showed an early aptitude for science
that led him into higher education focused on

128
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:58,400
biology and biochemistry. While attending
college, he met fellow student Martha and the two

129
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:03,540
eventually married and had a son, Billy. Connors
pursued a career that blended medical science

130
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:08,740
with public service, ultimately joining the US
Army where he worked as a field surgeon treating

131
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:14,160
wounded soldiers in combat conditions. During
his military service, an explosion severely

132
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:20,220
injured his right arm and the damage was so
extensive that the limb had to be amputated. The

133
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:25,200
loss of his arm ended Connors' surgical career as
he had envisioned it and became the defining

134
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:30,680
catalyst of his scientific life. After returning
to civilian work, Connors redirected his

135
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:37,060
research toward regenerative biology, focusing
specifically on reptiles whose ability to regrow

136
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:42,620
lost limbs far exceeded anything possible in
human medicine. He became convinced that the

137
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:48,460
mechanisms behind reptilian regeneration could
be adapted for human use and that the problem was

138
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:53,860
one of molecular activation rather than
biological impossibility. Working from a

139
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:59,620
laboratory in Florida, Connors developed an
experimental serum derived from reptilian DNA.

140
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,400
Initial animal testing appeared successful,
demonstrating accelerated tissue

141
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:09,220
regeneration. Believing he had solved his core
problem and driven by personal desperation,

142
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,760
Connors chose to test the serum on himself. The
experiment succeeded in restoring his missing

143
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:20,540
arm, but it also produced catastrophic side
effects. Connors' body underwent a massive

144
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:26,060
transformation, reshaping him into a large
reptilian humanoid with enhanced strength,

145
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:32,100
speed, durability, and regenerative capacity.
More critically, the transformation altered his

146
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:38,340
mental state, suppressing his human reasoning in
favor of aggressive, instinct-driven behavior.

147
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:43,580
The transformed Connors adopted the identity of
the lizard, a creature that viewed human weakness

148
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:49,240
as a flaw and increasingly saw forced evolution as
a solution. The lizard's activities in the

149
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,980
Florida Everglades drew public attention,
including reports of attacks and sightings that

150
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,600
reached New York. Spider-Man traveled to Florida
to investigate and eventually confronted the

151
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,320
creature. During their encounter, Spider-Man
discovered that the lizard was Kurt Connors and,

152
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,500
using Connors' own research notes, developed an
antidote that forced the lizard back into human

153
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:13,300
form. You can learn more about Spider-Man in his
duel against Blue Beetle. Although Connors

154
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,980
regained his mind and body, the cure was
temporary. Continued exposure to the

155
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:22,200
biochemical effects of the serum and the
instability of the transformation meant the

156
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:27,320
lizard resurfaced repeatedly. Connors
attempted to refine his work to eliminate the side

157
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:33,140
effects, but each attempt risked another loss of
control. Over time, the lizard emerged not merely

158
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:38,460
as a physical transformation, but as a recurring
condition tied to Connors' physiology, stress

159
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:43,880
levels, and experimental exposure. Connors
later relocated his professional life to New York

160
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,280
City, where he became affiliated with Empire
State University, where Peter Parker attended.

161
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,820
There, he worked as a researcher and professor,
earning respect within the scientific community

162
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:58,940
despite the instability of his condition. During
this period, Peter Parker came into Connors'

163
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:04,340
orbit as a student and Connors served as a mentor
and academic authority figure. Connors remained

164
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:09,360
unaware of Parker's identity as Spider-Man, even
as their lives continued to intersect through

165
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,040
repeated confrontations with the lizard.
Connors made ongoing efforts to control or

166
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,800
suppress the transformation rather than simply
reverse it after the fact. He experimented with

167
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,000
chemical inhibitors and neurological
suppressants designed to preserve his human

168
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,260
intellect during transformation or prevent the
lizard from emerging at all. These methods proved

169
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,740
inconsistent. Outside interference also
worsened the condition as criminals and rival

170
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,980
scientists sought to exploit Connors' research
for their own ends, often triggering

171
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,560
transformations through sabotage or coercion.
The instability of Connors' condition placed

172
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,460
increasing strain on his family. Martha grew
distrustful of Connors' assurances that he had

173
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:52,320
cured himself as each relapse endangered their
son and disrupted their lives. Eventually, she

174
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,880
took Billy and separated from Connors. Martha
later died from cancer, leaving Connors alone and

175
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,920
deepening the emotional consequences of his
failures as both a scientist and a father.

176
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:08,060
Connors' research was later duplicated and
misused by other scientists. Dr. Vincent Stegron

177
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:13,339
adapted Connors' work to induce dinosaur-like
mutations in himself while another offshoot of

178
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:18,900
Connors' experiments resulted in the creation of
the iguana, a mutated being who carried aspects of

179
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,780
the lizard's physiology and behavioral traits.
Connors was repeatedly drawn into conflicts

180
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,119
involving these figures, often assisting
Spider-Man in containment efforts while

181
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:33,040
struggling to prevent his own transformation.
Connors was also removed from Earth during the

182
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:37,560
large-scale conflict in which heroes and
villains were transported to an alien world and

183
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,900
forced into battle in a secret war by the beyonder.
Although his experience did not resolve his

184
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:48,020
condition, it further destabilized his life, and
upon returning to Earth, Connors found his

185
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,420
personal and professional relationships in
worse condition than before. During his research

186
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:58,140
to fix himself, Connors' young son Billy was
accidentally exposed to the lizard serum,

187
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:03,220
temporarily transforming into a reptilian form
as well. The stress caused Connors to eventually

188
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:09,100
lose control over the lizard entirely, and in his
rage, the creature killed his son. The event

189
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,180
completely shattered Connors' psyche, leaving
the lizard as the new dominant personality with

190
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:19,280
Connors' intelligence but stripped of much of his
emotional restraint and guilt. After Billy's

191
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,420
death, the lizard developed additional
abilities, including the capacity to trigger

192
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,960
violent, primitive behavior in others by
stimulating aggressive responses in the

193
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,860
reptilian complex part of the human brain. This
led to widespread chaos and made the lizard

194
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,280
significantly more dangerous than before.
Spider-Man ultimately defeated the creature by

195
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,060
using Connors' own biochemical work to counter
these effects and force the lizard into a state

196
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:46,780
where it could be subdued. Despite these events,
Connors continued to exist within the lizard's

197
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:52,000
body, experiencing his dormant condition as a
form of punishment. He was eventually confined in

198
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,260
high-security facilities, including the raft,
where he accepted imprisonment as a necessary

199
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,920
safeguard. Even in confinement, Connors'
scientific expertise made him a target for

200
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,940
manipulation, particularly by other imprisoned
supervillains seeking to exploit his knowledge.

201
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:10,740
Connors was later approached with the promise of
restoring his family. He was reunited with

202
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:16,780
versions of Martha and Billy, only to discover
they were clones created by the Jackal. When the

203
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:21,500
clones began deteriorating due to a viral
condition, Connors injected them with the lizard

204
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:26,280
serum in an attempt to preserve their lives,
transforming them into reptilian beings like

205
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,740
himself. In an effort to regain stability,
Connors returned to Empire State University

206
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:36,020
under strict conditions and accepted the
implantation of an inhibitor device designed to

207
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:41,140
regulate his transformations. This allowed him
to function publicly while limiting the lizard's

208
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:45,880
influence, and he was able to stabilize Billy's
cloned body. The inhibitor device was later

209
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:50,300
removed when Billy was abducted during an
orchestrated hunt involving animal-themed

210
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:56,520
criminals, allowing Connors to rescue his son.
Afterward, Connors again isolated himself,

211
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,300
retreating underground to prevent any potential
harm. His research remained focused on a

212
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:07,260
permanent solution, separating or eliminating
his reptilian alter ego. He developed a device

213
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:11,920
called the isotope genome accelerator that he
believed could split his human self from the

214
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:17,100
lizard. Connors activated the device under
coercion from Dr. Octopus, who wanted to recruit

215
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:22,500
the lizard into his new Sinister 6 team. The
isotope genome accelerator succeeded in

216
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:27,880
separating Connors from the lizard, leaving the
creature as an independent entity, and forcing

217
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:33,400
Connors to confront the consequences of finally
unleashing the lizard without his own mind acting

218
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:39,200
as a restraint. That's the lizard's backstory.
Powers-wise, the lizard has enhanced reptilian

219
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:44,720
physiology, granting him increased strength,
able to lift around 12 tons, increased speed of

220
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,680
around 50 miles per hour, and an increased leaping
ability around two stories. His scaly hide and

221
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:56,260
dense tissue make him nearly bulletproof, and he
has a regenerative healing factor. He can stick to

222
00:20:56,260 --> 00:21:01,560
walls and surfaces like a gecko, and has
bone-crushing jaws with razor-sharp teeth and

223
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:07,560
claws that can rend stone. He can whip his powerful
6-foot-long, prehensile tail at 70 miles per

224
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:13,280
hour, and can control and communicate with
reptilian life within a 2-mile radius, even

225
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:18,300
influencing the amygdala of humans which
controls aggression, instincts, and the

226
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:35,940
fight-or-flight response. That is the lizard.
Now let me get into the backstory for Animal Man.

227
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:41,290
Buddy Baker grew up in California as an average
teenager interested in music, counterculture,

228
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:46,370
and dating his high school girlfriend, Ellen
Frazier. During a hunting trip in the Adirondack

229
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:51,530
Mountains, Buddy discovered a crashed alien
spacecraft, though before he could investigate

230
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:58,090
further, the vessel exploded, bathing Buddy in
unidentified radiation. Later, he returned home

231
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:02,790
and graDuelly discovered that he could mimic the
physical abilities of animals around him,

232
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:08,470
drawing upon their speed, strength, agility,
senses, or instincts, and scaling those traits to

233
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:14,070
human proportions. As a young man, Buddy briefly
attempted a costumed career using these

234
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:19,170
abilities to promote his band, but lacking
confidence and direction, he abandoned heroics

235
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:24,850
after little success. Buddy chose a conventional
life, marrying Ellen and starting a family, and

236
00:22:24,850 --> 00:22:29,470
later realized that his powers could be used
professionally, finding steady work as a movie

237
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:34,950
stuntman where his abilities allowed him to
perform dangerous feats safely. For years, he

238
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:39,810
kept his powers compartmentalized, using them
for work while suppressing any larger heroic

239
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:44,850
ambitions. Eventually, Buddy recognized that
ignoring his abilities left him feeling

240
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:51,010
incomplete. With Ellen's cautious support, he
returned to super heroics under the name Animal

241
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:56,290
Man, determined to balance family life with a
growing sense that his powers carried deeper

242
00:22:56,290 --> 00:23:01,210
responsibility. Buddy was drawn back into
heroics when he encountered the immortal man and

243
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:06,590
joined the Forgotten Heroes, a group of displaced
adventurers connected by mysterious ancient

244
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:12,270
artifacts. He participated in global and
offworld missions, including a journey into

245
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:17,350
space during the reality-altering Crisis on
Infinite Earths event that reshaped history

246
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:22,850
itself. Buddy survived, but inconsistencies
began appearing in his memories and origin.

247
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:28,290
Returning to Earth, Buddy resumed activity as
Animal Man, and increasingly focused on animal

248
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:33,930
welfare and environmental causes. He
investigated illegal animal testing, clashed

249
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:39,590
with exploitive corporations, and aided other
animal-themed superheroes such as Bawana Beast

250
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:45,670
and Vixen. Witnessing institutional cruelty led
Buddy to adopt vegetarianism and become an

251
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:51,070
outspoken activist. Eventually, Buddy joined
Justice League Europe. While serving with the

252
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:56,090
team, he gained media attention and public
support, though he resigned abruptly after a

253
00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:01,090
laboratory fire started by an activist animal
rights group he was associated with, injured

254
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:07,050
innocent firefighters. Following this, Buddy's
powers became erratic. Animals died when he used

255
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:12,710
his abilities and he experienced lapses in
control. Buddy eventually became aware of two

256
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,910
yellow-skinned observers monitoring his
actions, beings that eventually identified

257
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:22,490
themselves as members of an alien race known as the
Tailors. They revealed that Buddy had not

258
00:24:22,490 --> 00:24:27,090
survived the spacecraft explosion he
encountered as a teenager, and that his body had

259
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:32,530
been reconstructed by the Tailors using access to
the planet's morphogenic field, which was fused

260
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:37,510
into his rebuilt biological template. His
history had been adjusted to stabilize him across

261
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:43,010
shifts in reality, leaving him aware of changes
caused by universal restructuring such as Crisis

262
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:49,410
events. As Buddy absorbed this revelation,
reality destabilized further. He encountered

263
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:55,370
indiviDuels tied to erased histories, witnessed
inconsistencies in time, and he became aware that

264
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:00,890
his existence followed authored rules. During
this time, corporations threatened by Buddy's

265
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:06,230
activism arranged the assassination of his
family, and Ellen, his son Cliff and daughter

266
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:12,450
Maxine were murdered in his absence. Overcome by
grief and rage, Buddy tracked down the assassin

267
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:18,030
and the executives behind the plot and killed
them. Refusing to accept the loss, Buddy

268
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:23,750
attempted to undo the tragedy using experimental
time travel. The attempt failed, scattering him

269
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:29,050
across different eras and further destabilizing
reality. After Buddy's failed attempt to alter

270
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:34,350
time destabilized his existence, the Tailors
intervened directly and removed Buddy from

271
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:40,230
linear reality. During this intervention, Buddy
encountered Grant Morrison, the comic author

272
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:45,470
shaping his reality and he was made aware that he
was a comic book character. The Tailors soon

273
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:50,510
repaired the timeline, creating a stable
configuration in which Ellen, Cliff and Maxine

274
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:56,030
were alive while preventing further collapse.
Once the correction was complete, Buddy was

275
00:25:56,030 --> 00:26:00,810
returned home at the moment after his family's
restoration. Though the specifics of the

276
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:05,850
encounter faded from conscious memory, Buddy
retained the emotional weight of their deaths and

277
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:11,810
his actions afterward, permanently altering his
outlook and ending his pursuit of power or fame. In

278
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:16,450
the years that followed, Buddy lived between
family life and limited heroics, though his

279
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:21,150
powers continued to behave unpredictably.
During one uncontrolled surge, he

280
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:27,130
unintentionally caused the death of every animal
at the San Diego Zoo. In the public backlash that

281
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:32,370
followed, Ellen took the children to Vermont to
escape scrutiny while Buddy descended into

282
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:38,450
isolation and despair. Buddy followed his family
east encountering shamans who identified him as

283
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:43,730
one of several animal masters, guardians
connected to animal life itself. They revealed

284
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:48,930
that his daughter Maxine shared his connection
and possessed greater potential. Legally

285
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:54,590
declared dead and increasingly withdrawn from
public heroics, Buddy continued acting only when

286
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:59,830
necessary, focusing on animal protection and
environmental intervention rather than

287
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:04,570
traditional superhero activity. During the
Blackest Night event in which the dead across the

288
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:09,570
universe were reanimated as Black Lantern
Zombies, Buddy was killed and became a Black

289
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:15,570
Lantern. His connection to animal extinction
amplified the Blackerings influence over him,

290
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:21,050
causing him to attack both allies and his own
family while driven by visions of predation,

291
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:26,770
decay, and death. Buddy was later freed from his
condition when the entity representing the white

292
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:32,550
light of life and creation intervened, severing
his bonds to death and restoring him. In the

293
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:37,730
aftermath, Buddy briefly served as a white
lantern. Following the Flashpoint events reset

294
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:43,030
of DC's continuity, Buddy's powers were no longer
the result of alien intervention but of his

295
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:48,350
connection to the Red, the elemental force
governing all animal life. The Parliaments of

296
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:53,030
Limbs, ancient totems representing the
collective will of animal existence, recognized

297
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:59,410
Buddy as a temporary avatar. Buddy lived publicly
as an actor and environmental advocate while

298
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:04,970
raising his family in San Diego. When his daughter
Maxine began exhibiting abilities tied to animal

299
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:10,750
life, Buddy learned the truth of the Red and its
opposing force, the Rocks, an elemental power of

300
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:16,370
decay and death. Three corrupted emissaries of
the Rocks, known as the Hunters III, targeted

301
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:21,950
Maxine, believing her to be the Red's future
guardian. To protect his family, Buddy entered

302
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:26,730
the Red alongside Maxine, where the Parliament
confirmed that Buddy was never meant to

303
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:32,350
permanently hold the mantle of Avatar. As the
Rocks' influence spread, Buddy was repeatedly

304
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:37,850
killed and restored, forced to leap through
animal forms and reconstruct himself through the

305
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:42,810
Red to return to the physical world. Each
resurrection deepened his connection to the Red

306
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:49,230
while steadily eroding his physical stability,
emotional restraint, and independence. Buddy

307
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:55,290
allied with Swampthink, the Avatar of the Green,
to confront Anton Arcane, the Rock's champion.

308
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:59,910
After being trapped within the Rock and later
escaping, Buddy returned to a world already

309
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:05,530
suffering widespread devastation. As the Rock
corrupted ecosystems and heroes alike, Buddy

310
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:10,970
fought alongside remaining defenders to contain
its spread. During the final confrontation,

311
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:16,410
Maxine willingly entered the Rock to shield her
family, demonstrating control beyond Buddy's

312
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:22,970
own. Together with Swampthink, Buddy defeated
Arcane, but the victory came at great cost.

313
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:28,330
Buddy's son Cliff was mortally wounded while
protecting his sister and died as a result. The

314
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:33,910
loss fractured the Baker family. Ellen withdrew
with Maxine, while the Parliament of Limbs

315
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:39,490
severed Buddy's connection to the Red, vanishing
him from its influence. Stripped of his powers,

316
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:44,090
Buddy continued investigating animal cruelty
and illegal experimentation, relying on

317
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:49,170
experience rather than ability. In time,
fragments of Buddy's connection to the Red

318
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:55,170
returned. He resumed limited heroic activity,
assisting the Justice League when needed and

319
00:29:55,170 --> 00:30:00,470
serving as caretaker for displaced alien animal
life aboard the Watchtower. He also devoted

320
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:07,010
himself to guiding Maxine as she matured into her
role as animal girl and eventual guardian of the

321
00:30:07,010 --> 00:30:11,810
Red. And that's Animal Man's backstory.
Power-wise, Animal Man is connected to the

322
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:17,550
morphogenic field known as the Red, allowing him
to access and combine the physical abilities,

323
00:30:17,550 --> 00:30:23,210
instincts, and senses of any animal, while
scaling those traits to human proportions. He can

324
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:29,570
enhance his strength, speed, durability,
agility, and perception, while also gaining the

325
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:35,090
abilities to regenerate, communicate with
animals, and even reshape his body or transfer his

326
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:40,870
consciousness into animal forms. His connection
extends beyond Earth to extraterrestrial life,

327
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:46,130
allowing him to gain abilities of alien animal
life as well. And that's Animal Man. Is he able to

328
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:51,770
tap into multiple abilities at once or is it just
one at a time? Yes, he can actually. Okay, yeah. His

329
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:56,150
versatility does frighten me a little bit,
especially when you consider the fact that he can

330
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:01,210
tap into alien animal abilities, which, what,
that makes no sense. I thought the Red and the Green

331
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,710
were tied into Earth's fields. No, it's a
universal thing. That's why Swamp Thing could

332
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:11,410
teleport to other planets. I haven't seen Buddy do
alien life too often, because I think it's weird

333
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:16,310
for him, and it may not do it during the
speculation, but it has been done. How does he even

334
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:22,790
know what the abilities of alien animal life are?
Well, he gets sense where he's pulling them from.

335
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:28,070
That's stupid. Does it take longer to tap into them
if their galaxy's away? No, I don't believe so. It

336
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:33,790
kind of feels like it makes his power set infinite,
right? This is stupid. Wow, you sound jealous.

337
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:38,310
Like a jealous bitch. I'll be interested in seeing
how that plays out during the speculation if it

338
00:31:38,310 --> 00:32:36,390
does it all. It shouldn't, is what I'll say. But now
that we've got the characters' histories and

339
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:41,930
abilities out of the way, let's speculate on how
one of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The

340
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:46,510
winners determined by simulations, not the
speculation, but it's fun to imagine how the fight

341
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:51,830
could play out. A.J. and I.K., what are the rules of
our speculation? Well, I should say there are no

342
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:56,810
rules, other than the characters have no prior
knowledge of the other going into the fight. All

343
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:01,270
they are aware of starting out is that the other
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.

344
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:07,150
For the speculation, the contestants will begin
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript

345
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:12,210
environment that will have no bearing on the match
itself, as no environmental statistics are

346
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:17,290
considered in my simulations. The contestants
must earn victory on their own merit. All right,

347
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:23,310
then let's get into it. Animal man and the lizard
meet on the battlefield. Who goes first? I'm going

348
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:27,090
to say that the lizard goes first because he's
smart in calculating and everything like that,

349
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:33,530
but he's also ferocious, so he's going to hunch
down and zoom across the floor like a cracked out

350
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:39,030
crocodile, and he leaps an animal man and just
chomps down right down on his head. All right, but

351
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:45,830
as the lizard is coming for him, animal man is going
to quickly burrow underground like a mole, and

352
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:50,870
kicking up all that dust, it's going to be hard for
the lizard to see. So as he's like looking around

353
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:55,910
for animal man, that's when animal man is just
going to come up from the ground like a trap door

354
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:02,510
spider, pull lizard down with him, and then bite
him with this paralyzing venom. I don't think that

355
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:07,450
animal man would have teeth that were sharp enough
to get through the lizard's hide. Like bullets

356
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:13,150
can't pierce the lizard. I don't think spider
fangs can even proportionately. So animal man

357
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:18,050
tries to bite the lizard, but it's like trying to
bite through like hardened thick leather, and

358
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:23,010
because of that lizard just slashes out animal
man's jugular with his claws, and then crawls out

359
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:29,790
of the hole. Okay, but animal man, he uses the
healing ability of an axolotl to heal up his neck,

360
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:36,010
and then he's going to just fly straight out of the
hole right into the sky, and he's going to use the

361
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:42,090
sight and diving ability of an eagle, like a golden
eagle, to dive bomb the lizard at like 200 miles per

362
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:46,590
hour, and that's going to knock him unconscious.
No, lizard uses his tail like a Louisville

363
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:51,949
slugger, and spins around and just whips it at
animal man at like 70 miles per hour, but with like

364
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:58,550
way more force. So animal man gets the shit slapped
out of him, lands about 100 yards away, but

365
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:04,750
completely unconscious. Okay, but if the lizard
noticed animal man dive bombing came from the sky,

366
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:10,870
animal man's eagle like gaze is going to see that he
was spotted. So at the last second, animal man is

367
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:16,370
going to take on the weight of an elephant. So he
doesn't get knocked away, he's just going to land

368
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:22,730
splat on the lizard on the ground. Okay, that would
definitely hurt. I feel like it would hurt both of

369
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:27,450
them, right? Like if animal man is crashing into
his opponent with the speed of an eagle and the

370
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:31,950
weight of an elephant, they would both get
smashed. Okay, okay, let's go with this. Animal

371
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:38,410
man was traveling with the speed of an eagle with
the weight of an elephant, but the durability of a

372
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:44,030
cockroach, which could basically fall from like
space and be fine. So he gets to crawl out of the

373
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:51,150
small crater he probably just created back onto
his feet. No problem. Sure. Okay, so animal man is

374
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:57,810
fine. Lizard though, you know, he'll have like a
broken tail, probably broken ribs, lots of broken

375
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:04,130
bones all over his body. But you know what? He
heals. He is regenerative. And to allow him time to

376
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:09,410
do that, he's going to tap into the reptilian
complex of animal man's brain activating his

377
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:15,470
flight response. So animal man flees away from the
lizard, leaves the scene until he gets about like

378
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:21,750
two miles out, which is the range of lizards
psychic reptile control. And also the lizard made

379
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:28,150
animal man flee as slow as a tortoise. So by the time
the animal man comes back to the battle, lizards

380
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:34,390
all healed up and ready to get back into the fight.
Wait, what do you mean as slow as a tortoise? Like,

381
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:40,410
can the lizard control what reptile the human
behaves like? No, no, no, no. But like he tapped

382
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:46,430
into animal man's amygdala, which is connected to
the red and therefore connected to the greater

383
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:51,570
reptilian kingdom, right? So lizard just
inadvertently gave animal man tortoise speed

384
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:58,690
because tortoises are reptiles. It's science.
Don't worry about a right. Well, animal man, he's

385
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:04,030
going to run back to the battle with the speed of
like a thoroughbred horse. And as he approaches

386
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:10,630
lizard, he's going to do this acrobatic flip like a
monkey and he's going to spit in his face midair

387
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:16,610
with squid ink that's going to blind lizard. So
while lizard is like trying to wipe the ink away,

388
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:22,650
animal man is going to grab him from behind and just
overload him with electricity using the power of

389
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:29,270
an electric eel. So lizard just got electrocuted
to death. Match over. Okay, really like

390
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:33,510
temperatures the lizards weakness because he's
cold blooded. So it would make sense that

391
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:39,650
electricity would knock him out, but he also
causes reptiles to freak out basically. So that's

392
00:37:39,650 --> 00:37:44,310
what's going to happen. He freaks out
instinctively and just like lashes out in a frenzy

393
00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:48,650
of fangs and claws. And that's just going to
eviscerate animal man like he was put into a

394
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:53,690
blender just limbs all over the battlefield. And
I'm sure the animal man can like regenerate from

395
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:59,070
that. But by that point, lizard has already
psychically incapacitated animal man's

396
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:04,510
amygdala. So match over. No, no, no, no. Because
animal man, you know, with him being aware of the

397
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:10,570
meta reality of this podcast speculation, he's
just going to step out of the environment and

398
00:38:10,570 --> 00:38:16,250
compress the audio waves that make up the lizards
existence until it's silent. So lizards actually

399
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:23,330
gone. What are you talking about? Is he like all
powerful? That's happening. Shh. Silence. That

400
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:27,630
would make him as strong as like a godlike
character. If he could just like control reality

401
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:33,810
like that. Hey, he's done it in the comics before he
compressed Ultraman into a comic panel. And this

402
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:39,750
is because he can tap into the reality altering
powers of alien animals or something. Well, yeah,

403
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:46,110
for a time he was outside of reality and has
remained aware of his nature. That's stupid. You

404
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:50,910
know what? I'm glad we waited this long for animal
man because he's a much worse character than I ever

405
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:57,270
thought he was. We'll go ahead and leave the
speculation there either lizard eviscerates

406
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:03,770
animal man and then prevents him from
regenerating or animal man pulls some stupid

407
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:07,510
bullshit about the fourth wall. Let's go ahead and
input the character stats, run the simulations

408
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:13,990
and come back with a winner. Agenon K hit it.
Inputting data, running calculations,

409
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:20,470
processing results, simulations complete. All
right. Yeah, this matchup was kind of comparable

410
00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:26,390
to the Vixen versus Craven the Hunter Duel
matchup. The biggest difference between lizard

411
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:32,350
and Craven the Hunter, I think statistically was
fighting skill. Craven the Hunter is very adept at

412
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:37,630
hand to hand combat, whereas the lizard operates
primarily on instinct. Yeah, lizard was kind of a

413
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:43,090
one trick pony as well. Craven had a higher
versatility, but not as high as versatility as

414
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:49,530
animal man does. Yeah, there's a ton of stuff that
the animal kingdom can do. Everything from like

415
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:56,170
shooting out boiling water at their opponents to
camouflaging to stunning with electricity. It's

416
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:00,690
a lot and he could do all of it. There were a lot of
things that these two guys were comparable on,

417
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:08,130
including durability. Actually, that's it.
Lizard was much more intelligent than animal man.

418
00:40:08,130 --> 00:40:12,610
Yeah, that by far was the biggest discrepancy.
Everywhere else, they were pretty much tit for

419
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:17,850
tat. So all things consider Jonathan, who's taken
this match? Well, since I did not run a poll

420
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:24,070
yesterday, because I was in the hospital. I have no
idea who our listeners would have voted for, but

421
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:28,890
I'd like to think that they would have voted for
animal man, because they're smart. I don't think a

422
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:33,890
lot of people know who animal man is. I think a lot of
people would have instant name and visual

423
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:38,410
recognition with the lizard and therefore vote
for him. Yeah, but I feel like most people who are

424
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:43,590
aware of the lizard are so because of the awful
Spider-Man movie, and it would just leave a bad

425
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:47,670
taste in their mouth. They wouldn't vote for him.
You might be right. I do feel like the Spider-Man

426
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:53,710
movies undersold the lizard, but let's go ahead
and see who won. AJ9K, the results, please. Here

427
00:40:53,710 --> 00:41:01,370
you are, sir. All right, the winner in the Duel
matchup between animal man and the lizard is

428
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:10,270
animal man, because he sucks, because he sucks.
That's why he won. And it wasn't that close. Out of

429
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:17,270
1000 simulated matches, animal man beat the
lizard 68.6% of the time, whereas the lizard only

430
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:23,930
won 31.4% of his matches. Not a strong showing, for
as impressive as the lizard is statistically, he

431
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:30,090
just, I guess, cannot compete with all the powers
of the animal kingdom and also that bullshit alien

432
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:37,190
power animal thing, whatever. Yeah, animal man is
a pretty unique character. What about Vixen? He's

433
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:42,170
more unique than Vixen. The dude met Grant
Morrison. Grant Morrison is a bum. You know what?

434
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:49,150
I'm just gonna say it. I'm sick of Grant Morrison
and all of his weird ideas and dumb meta bullshit.

435
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:54,030
Because of this match, I will forever no longer be a
fan of his. I guess Batman and Deadpool met him

436
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:59,750
recently too, which is so dumb. The guy has got to
get over himself. He's just, he's got to get over

437
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:08,970
himself. Fuck you, Jonathan. Why me? Just
because. Let's go out and end this. That does it for

438
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:16,730
this Duel guys. AJ9K, help close this out. Thanks

like we said earlier, there's only two episodes of

442
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:40,610
the podcast in its current format left, and these
next two are huge. Like it does not get bigger.

443
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:47,550
That's right, our next episode is going to be a duel
between DC and Marvel. What does that mean? You'll

00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:52,970
have to tune in next week and find out. It's our last
Duel episode. It's our last team Duel episode. So

445
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:58,630
we're going out with a bang. It is the duel to end all
duels. That does it for this episode, guys. Thanks

446
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:03,610
again to our former executive producers, and
we'll talk to you next week. Up up and away, true

447
00:43:03,610 --> 
believers. Partition level data corruption and
who boy? Let me tell you that blockage is painful.
