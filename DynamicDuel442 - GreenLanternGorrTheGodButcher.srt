00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,660
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi, welcome to
the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:32,460
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,760
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin

4
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,140
brother, Marvelous Joe. And in this episode, as a
tie-in to the upcoming Superman film that's

5
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:49,880
coming out in less than a month, we are pitting the
Green Lantern Guy Gardner against Gorr the God

6
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:55,700
Butcher. Now, you may remember Gorr from the
terrible movie, Thor, Love and Thunder, and

7
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:01,380
you'll be seeing Guy in the Superman movie, which
is why this is a tie-in. The equally terrible

8
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:08,860
Superman movie you forgot to say. Oh, it's going to
be amazing, dude. It's going to suck. I'm just

9
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,980
putting that out there. It's not even going to be
comparable to Thor, Love and Thunder. It's going

10
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:18,300
to be infinitely better because that was like the
worst thing Marvel's ever put out. One of the worst

11
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:21,920
things for sure. Christian Bale definitely
deserved better. But yeah, this will be an

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,580
interesting one. I kind of feel bad for Guy Gardner
because I think he's going to get the shit kicked

13
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:32,620
out of him by Gorr. I just don't see any other way
this fight's going to go down. I just realized this

14
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:37,740
is kind of a similar battle to what we did with our
White Lantern versus Null episode. Yeah, except

15
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,880
the characters of Null and White Lantern are much
more powerful than Guy Gardner and Gorr. Okay,

16
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,980
cool. It's a lesser episode of that then. Sweet.
Pretty much. Well, I'm still looking forward to

17
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:54,420
it. I know there's a lot of Guy Gardner fans out
there. I don't really think there's any Gorr fans,

18
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,700
but we're going to find out who's going to win
between the two characters later on in this

19
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:04,180
episode. I'm a Gorr fan. You would be gross. Before
we get into the battle, we're going to break down

20
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:09,100
the comic book movie news from the past week of
which we got quite a few news items. We learned that

21
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,980
John Berndtall's Punisher is going to join the
fourth Spider-Man movie, Brand New Day. Clayface

22
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,940
was cast in this film, and we got the official
trailer for Sandman Season 2. As always, we list

23
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,920

click to the No Prize. A No Prize is an award that

42
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,240
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version, the
Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award we post on

43
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,300
Instagram for the person that we feel gave the best
answer to our question of the week. Last week, we

44
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,600
asked you guys, what has been your favorite
Superman moment from past films or television

45
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,640
series and why? We got five answers this week.
We're going to break down our three honorable

46
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:42,020
mentions before revealing the week's No Prize
winner. Our first honorable mention goes to

47
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:48,520
Travis Herndon, who said, What's up, dynamic
dudes? Travis here. Shout out to my evil twin. So my

48
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:56,020
choice would be from the movie Superman vs. the
Elite, the instant lobotomy. That scene was just

49
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:02,340
straight up badass because one, we never seen Heat
Vision use that small to go through somebody's eye

50
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,580
and like fuck up their powers and stuff to
eternally without them knowing. So to me, instant

51
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:14,560
lobotomy is the best Superman moment for me. Hands
down. Yeah, so Superman vs. the Elite was a

52
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,760
direct-to-video animated film based off of
Action Comics 775, which was titled What's So

53
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:27,280
Funny about Truth, Justice, and the American Way.
In which Superman goes up against a group of

54
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,560
anti-heroes known as the Elite, who kind of try and
make Superman seem like he's obsolete. And when he

55
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,680
turns their bad guy rules against them, he kind of
shows them that, hey, you're lucky I don't play in a

56
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,320
moral gray area like you guys do. One of the things
he did, of course, was take away the powers of the

57
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:52,340
leader, Manchester Black. And he did it in the most
like badass way. Yeah, it was kind of an ethically

58
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:57,760
shaky action on behalf of Superman, right? I
agree. Because what he did is he combined his X-ray

59
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,940
vision with his microscopic vision, slash
telescopic vision, I think, and his Heat Vision.

60
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,020
You think that he could do this all the time against
other villains. I'm not sure why he doesn't, I

61
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:12,340
guess because it's a morally shaky action. But
it's definitely an interesting feat for the

62
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:19,020
character. I remember reading one JLA comic book
issue where Marshall Manhunter linked the minds

63
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:24,180
of Superman and the Flash, and the Flash was
telepathically able to see through Superman's

64
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:30,540
X-ray vision. And then he phased into a guy's head
to do a similar effect where he messed with his

65
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:35,180
brain to remove his superpowers. And then, of
course, we also have the identity crisis arc,

66
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,240
which was all about the Justice League performing
brain surgery on villains to make him less evil.

67
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,780
It's such a bizarre use of superpowers that has
been kind of a recurring motif among DC

68
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:51,420
superheroes. Yeah, it's kind of like clockwork
orange in a way where it's like, can you force

69
00:06:51,420 --> 00:07:00,080
people to be moral? And it is not ethically sound, I
would say. But of course, in the Justice League

70
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,920
versus the Elite storyline, the effects were
temporary. Like Superman made Manchester Black

71
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:10,500
think that he killed all of his allies when he
really didn't. So he was just kind of giving them a

72
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:15,700
taste of what it would be like if he was evil. It's a
great storyline, great movie. Definitely

73
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:20,760
recommend it to anyone who has not yet seen it,
though I just spoiled it all for you. Sorry, guys.

74
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:26,100
See it in action. Don't just take Jonathan's word
for it. Right, exactly. Great answer, Travis. Our

75
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:32,680
next honorable mention goes to Cyrus Moore. Who
said? Hey guys, Cyrus Moore here. I think the best

76
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,920
Superman moments happen to be in the movie The
Death of Superman. I think it's got some of the best

77
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:44,940
fight scenes with Doomsday. And I just, I think
it's the best Superman movie personally. It's

78
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:51,140
probably one of the saddest, but it was also great
to see Superman save Lois Lane in the Doomsday

79
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:57,100
fight. So yeah, we reviewed The Death of Superman
on this podcast when it came out. It was a fantastic

80
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:03,340
animated film. It was like part one of a two part
film that also included Reign of the Superman that

81
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:09,200
was also really good. Now this was not the first
time we had seen Superman fight Doomsday in

82
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,880
animation. Of course, there was the Superman
Doomsday film that came out like over a decade

83
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:20,100
prior to this film coming out. When this movie came
out, we had also just recently seen Batman vs

84
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,400
Superman where Superman dies at the hands of
Doomsday as well. Out of all the different

85
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,180
adaptations of The Death of Superman comic book
story arc, I think The Death of Superman animated

86
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:34,980
movie was the best. It was a real tear-jerker, but
with great action. Yeah, I would actually agree

87
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:41,179
with that. So great answer Cyrus. Our final
honorable mention goes to by DearBangora who

88
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:48,500
said, Hello dynamic duo. My favorite scene has to
be from the end of Superman and Lois. The fact that

89
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:54,500
they have this recap very similar to Six Feet Under
and they go through all the life of Superman and his

90
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:01,240
family and his kids. Just really embodied all of
what Superman is meant to be. Great Tyler Houghlin

91
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:09,660
scene, great scene in general, great way to end the
DC TV universe. Okay, so I will fully admit I was not

92
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:15,840
a big fan of the Superman and Lois television
series. Not for any reason that I didn't like the

93
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,180
story or anything like that. I just was always too
busy to watch it and by that point I was kind of done

94
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:28,360
with the CW. That said, by Dear's description of
the final scene of the show kind of really makes me

95
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,420
want to watch it. Yeah, I kept hearing that it was
really good among fans and on Reddit and stuff like

96
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,340
that. So I heard the show as a whole was just
amazing. And I think if you had watched it, maybe

97
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:43,120
this would actually get the no prize win. Who
knows? Yeah, that's actually very possible. My

98
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,340
apologies to everyone who enjoyed the show who
knows that this should probably get the win. But

99
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:54,280
alas, it does not. We want to give a quick shout out
to Alex Albro for calling in with his answer. But

100
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:01,220
the winner of this week's no prize is Lorenzo
Valdez. Who said? This is Lorenzo Valdez calling

101
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:07,260
in once again. My favorite Superman moment from a
film is the first flight scene for Man of Steel. My

102
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:11,440
favorite Superman moment from a television
series. Well, there are so many clonda moments

103
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,000
that I want to choose from Smallville. But the one
I'm going to go with because it feels most like what

104
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,480
you're soliciting, which is specifically a
Superman moment, because it's set at the top of the

105
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:26,980
daily planet. It's the clonda kiss from the end of
the season eight episode of Smallville power.

106
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:32,840
Clona forever and always. Bye bye. So I finally
realized what Lorenzo is saying when he mentions

107
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:40,720
clona. And I guess that's like shipping Clark and
Lana Lang, which no, I am anti-clona. He belongs

108
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:46,500
with Lois Lane. So I'm not really counting the
Smallville kiss scene. What I really love about

109
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:53,100
his answer is the Superman first flight scene from
Man of Steel, because that was intense. I still

110
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:59,180
remember watching that in theaters and just being
so moved by Hans Zimmer's sweeping score. It is

111
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:06,180
hands down. I think my favorite Superman moment
from the entirety of the Snyderverse. But who's

112
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:11,320
your favorite version of Lana Lang, though,
Jonathan? Oh, like favorite actress. Um, I would

113
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:17,260
say the one that I think is most close to the comics
was actually the Annette O'Toole version of the

114
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,140
character from Superman 3. She would later
actually be cast as Martha Kent in the Smallville

115
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,920
television series. So it's not the Kristen Crook
version from Smallville? No, she was fine. I just

116
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,040
think Annette O'Toole was more comics accurate.
I'm pretty sure Lorenzo Valdez is going to want to

117
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:39,360
fight you now. Come at me, bro. I thought I want to
make Clois a word, but Clois forever and always. I

118
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,100
think I've always been more of a, uh, clunder woman
type guy. But congrats to Lorenzo Valdez for

119
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,960
winning this week's snow prize. If you the
listener want a shot at winning your own no prize,

120
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:53,140
stay tuned to later on this episode when we'll be
asking another question of the week. And now that

121
00:11:53,140 --> 00:12:03,640
that's done, on to the news. Alright, in a fairly
surprising bit of news from this past week, we

122
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,680
learned that John Bernthal, who plays the
character of Frank Castle the Punisher, will be

123
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:16,140
joining the cast of Spider-Man Brand New Day in a
move that makes me go, what is going on? I had no idea

124
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:21,680
what this film was going to be, but I think the
addition of John Bernthal to the cast gives us a

125
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,160
clearer picture. So previously you and I
conjectured that the film could be adapting the

126
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,280
Spider-Verse storyline because we thought maybe
Sadie Sink was going to play in Alternate Universe

127
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:36,280
Gwen Stacy. There are a ton of rumors going around
the internet right now, including rumors that the

128
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:42,400
story is going to involve symbiotes and the Hulk.
None of those rumors were substantiated, but we

129
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,740
did get confirmation from the Hollywood Reporter
that, yeah, the Punisher is going to be joining the

130
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:52,020
story, which really makes me rethink all my
previous notions in that they appear to be taking a

131
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:56,680
more grounded approach to this upcoming
Spider-Man film. Yeah, you would think that

132
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:03,520
someone from the Netflix shows, which were all
pretty street level and grounded, would make this

133
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:09,240
Spider-Man film somewhat like that, right?
Right. And it makes me think that Sadie Sink is more

134
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,920
likely going to be playing Felicia Hardy, the
black cat, because she's a more grounded street

135
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,200
level character, I think. And that the villain is
maybe going to be the kingpin, and maybe we'll see

136
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,160
Daredevil in addition to the Punisher. Or maybe
the rumors are true and the bad guy is going to be Mr.

137
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:29,500
Negative, who is another New York City crime boss
who has the power of the life force and the dark

138
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:35,660
force, which are abilities shared by the heroic
duo of Cloak and Dagger. So maybe those guys are

139
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:41,100
joining the story as well. And this really is
shaping up to be a more direct adaptation of the

140
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,780
brand new day story arc. Yeah, there's currently
rumors going around that Nicole Kidman is going to

141
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:52,260
play negative woman, essentially. Oh, I don't
know about that. I wouldn't like that. I was kind of

142
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:57,620
setting my hopes on Steven Yun as Mr. Negative
himself, Martin Lee, who's a pretty cool

143
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:02,580
character. He's kind of like Too Faced in the sense
that he's a crime boss who jumps between his light

144
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:06,780
side and his dark side, although in this case it's
very much literally his light side and his dark

145
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:12,180
side. When he's in his dark force form, he appears
as a photo negative kind of. And when he corrupts

146
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:17,200
other people or imbues objects with his dark
force, it appears as like a photo negative. It can

147
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:22,720
make for some pretty compelling visual effects, I
think, but I think the Punisher would make sense as

148
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,300
an ally going up against the Mr. Negative crime
boss. I'm seeing a visual motif with all of these

149
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:35,720
characters. You have Punisher, Black Cat, maybe
Cloak and Dagger, maybe Mr. Negative. It's all

150
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:42,020
black and white. And maybe even Black Suit
Spider-Man? I could see the movie posters now.

151
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:46,760
They'd have to introduce the symbiotes though if
we're going with Black Suit Spider-Man, but who

152
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:51,520
knows? Maybe Venom is in the movie too. At this
point, I feel like anything's possible, but I

153
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:58,300
gotta assume that the film is taking a much more
bare bones down to Earth approach to its story.

154
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,960
Maybe, maybe, maybe not, especially if there's
symbiotes involved. That being said, you know,

155
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:09,380
Berndthal's portrayal of Frank Castle the
Punisher is pretty damn rated R, both in his show

156
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,100
and in the Daredevil series. I'm wondering how
they're going to get away with that in a PG-13

157
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,000
Spider-Man movie. Like, what the hell is Peter
Parker going to do when he straight up sees the

158
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,120
Punisher rip a dude's throat out? Eh, it's
probably going to happen off camera. And then you

159
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,520
see Spider-Man puke in his mask or something like
that. Boom, there you go. Comedy gold. I just

160
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,040
remembered that the Punisher first appeared in a
Spider-Man comic. That's correct. He was a

161
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,200
conflicted Spider-Man bad guy who was trying to
kill him due to his misperception of Spider-Man

162
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,060
that he was a murderer at the time. It's really
interesting news that it'll be interesting to see

163
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:47,180
who else gets added to this Spider-Man forecast,
especially if they're coming from the Marvel

164
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:52,580
Netflix universe, which is, you know, now part of
the MCU. But there were a lot of characters there,

165
00:15:52,580 --> 00:16:01,900
and that brings us to our question of the week.
Besides the Punisher and obviously Daredevil,

166
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,460
which of the former Marvel Netflix characters
would you want to see in the next Spider-Man film

167
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:12,180
and why? Now, we're excluding Daredevil here
because I think everyone will pick him, but if

168
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:18,420
Marvel were to include either Jessica Jones or
Iron Fist, Luke Cage, Electra, etc., we want to

169
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,960
know who you guys would most want to be in this film.

174
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:52,000
Moving on to DC News, we learned last week that DC
Studios has cast its lead actor in the upcoming

175
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,540
Clayface live action film, and it looks like the
actor Tom Reese-Harris will be playing the

176
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:05,339
titular Batman villain. Now, I have no idea who
this guy is. I looked at his IMDb. I have not seen a

177
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:11,760
single one of his films. To me, he looks like the
white Rami Malek, but I'm okay with that because

178
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,400
they both kind of have these haunting looks with
the high cheekbones and sunken eyes. I'm sure the

179
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,260
guy is a fantastic actor, considering he's
British and they tend to play more technical

180
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:28,780
performances, which I think is perfect for
something like a Clayface film where he's an actor

181
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:34,460
and needs to be able to play different personas, I
guess you could say. I don't know much about the

182
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:39,960
actor either. I like the way that John Staroski put
a best on our Discord server regarding the actor's

183
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:45,700
appearance in that he looks like if David Bowie
fucked a scars guard, and I thought that was pretty

184
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:51,660
apt. Now, the film is going to be directed by James
Watkins, who also directed the horror film Speak

185
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:56,580
No Evil, and the original screenplay draft was
written by Mike Flanagan, although apparently

186
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:04,460
the Oscar-nominated writer Hussien Amini has
done rewrites. It's produced by Matt Reeves, who

187
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:10,720
also produced the Batman Caped Crusader animated
series, which did a fantastic rendition of

188
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,760
Clayface, and I'm really hoping that this film
takes some of the horror cues from that television

189
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,960
series. Yeah, I think we mentioned before on this
podcast that 2024 had like four or five different

190
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:26,760
renditions of Clayface on different television
shows and stuff, including Suicide Squad,

191
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:33,360
Isakai, Batman Caped Crusader, Creature
Commandos, and Harley Quinn. Yes, I just want an

192
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,860
amalgam of all those versions rolled into one.
Yeah, maybe not the Harley Quinn version, but

193
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,140
yeah, I love the rest of them. I don't believe
there's a release date for this yet, but it will

194
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:49,600
start filming fairly soon in the UK. In other DC
news, we got to our official trailer for Sandman

195
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:56,900
Season 2, which is being released in two parts this
year. If you listen to our review of Sandman Season

196
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:03,900
1, you'll know that I'm a huge Sandman fan, and I
loved that first season. Ever since then, I've

197
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:11,140
been stoked for the continuation of that series on
Netflix. Season 2 will be the final season, but it

198
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:15,740
does look like it's going to wrap up Sandman's
story nicely. We're going to be moving through a

199
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:23,160
lot of story here, everything from James Return to
Hell, to him finding his son Orpheus, to his

200
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:31,140
involvement with the Fairy Folk, to ultimately
the vengeance of Lita Hall and the Furies. It's

201
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:37,020
going to be an epic season, no doubt. Again, one of
the coolest aspects, I think, of this season in

202
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:44,200
particular, is that we get to see all seven members
of the Endless, including Destruction, who we

203
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,580
missed out on in the teaser trailer for this
season. Of course, we get Gwendolyn Christie

204
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:55,160
returning to her role as Lucifer. We get to see the
demon Azazel, who's like this shadowy, morphing

205
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:02,080
creature full of eyes and teeth. We get to see Nada,
who is James' true love in the series. And we get to

206
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:08,680
see Jack Gleason, the actor who played Prince
Joffrey, play Puck in the Sandman show, which I

207
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:13,600
think is perfect casting. That is, yeah. I was
surprised to see King Joffrey. I was like, what the

208
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,880
hell is he doing here? He just has such a weird,
sinister face, but as the character of Puck from

209
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,860
Midsummer Night's Dream, yeah, that's
perfection. Now, the story of Sandman has always

210
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:27,640
spanned centuries, and it looks like we're going
to see that as well, which is one of the more epic

211
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:34,060
aspects that I love about this story is that it's
not just confined to one setting, one timeframe,

212
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:39,980
one set of characters. It can really go anywhere,
and it does. For any of those unfamiliar with the

213
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:45,100
Sandman story, I definitely recommend watching
season one prior to the release of season two on

214
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:51,300
Netflix. The first part is coming out July 3rd,
just a couple of weeks here, and volume two is

215
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:58,520
coming out July 24th at the end of the month. I can't
fucking wait! And I just kind of want to sleep until

216
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:04,280
the show starts. I liked the trailer that much.
Actually, regarding the newcomer perspective,

217
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:08,700
that's one of the things I thought about while
watching this trailer was, if someone hasn't

218
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:14,200
watched season one or is completely unfamiliar
with the Sandman story or universe, I got to wonder

219
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,660
what they think about this trailer, because it
really goes all over the place. You said, you know,

220
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:23,840
the story spans centuries, but it's not a
straightforward fantasy series in the way that

221
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,540
most people think of fantasy series. And I got to
think that as a newcomer, if this trailer was the

222
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:35,000
first thing I saw, I would be so compelled to watch
it, because it looks so damn good. So damn good, so

223
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,440
damn expensive, still, which I love to see. Yeah,
the visual effects are on point. The

224
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:53,500
cinematography looks amazing. Yeah, again, wake
me up when it's July 3rd. But that does it for all of

225
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:59,260
the news for this episode, so now let's go ahead and
move on to the main event, where we pit the Green

226
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:21,120
Lantern Guy Gardner against the Thor villain,
Gore the God Butcher. Okay, the Green Lantern Guy

227
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:27,940
Gardner versus Gore the God Butcher. Now, I will be
totally honest and say that Guy Gardner is not my

228
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:33,500
favorite Green Lantern. In fact, he's probably
one of my least favorite Green Lanterns. But as I

229
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:38,080
mentioned earlier, he does have a lot of fans out
there. I feel like a lot of people just have like a

230
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,600
love-hate relationship with him, because he's
kind of a douchebag. But an endearing one in that he

231
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:48,300
frequently gets his ass kicked by Batman, like
punched in the face. Those one time. And kind of put

232
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:56,300
in his place, you know? He's kind of there to be a
punching bag for, I think, other heroes in a way. He

233
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:04,020
doesn't really take any guff from anyone except
when he does. And that's satisfying, I guess. I

234
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:10,020
guess also he does have a lot of heart in that while
he is kind of a dickbag, he is well-meaning and

235
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:16,320
legitimately heroic. Yes, as you will hear later
on in my backstory for Guy Gardner, he's

236
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,600
definitely very stubborn, doesn't know when to
give up, and because of that, yes, it does make him

237
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:26,240
very heroic. And he rises to the occasion. I think
Gore the God Butcher would also see himself as

238
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:32,060
heroic in his campaign against basically all
deities. We mentioned briefly Gore's inclusion

239
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:37,940
in the Thor 11 Thunder film. There's so much that
that movie got wrong from his appearance to his

240
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:43,700
powers. What about his origin? His origin is
incorrect. It's a shame that Marvel itself

241
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:48,560
screwed it up because who knows when we'll get to
see any more correct adaptation of Gore on the

242
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:53,480
screen. One of the many reasons that I'm still
pissed off to this day because of that film, and

243
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:57,840
hopefully I could do the character more justice in
this dual speculation. But to explain the

244
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,260
methodology behind our duels, let's go to our
sentient dual simulator Alfred Jarvis-9000.

245
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:08,320
AJ9K tell our listeners how you go about
determining a winner in our dual matchups. Yes, of

246
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:13,260
course, sir. The way I determine a winner between
the contestants is by running 1000 Monte Carlo

247
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:18,680
simulations using the characters statistics. A
Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic model

248
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,380
used to determine outcomes through random
sampling. In this case, I randomize the

249
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:28,340
statistics along a normal distribution as a way to
simulate the many variables that can occur during

250
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:33,280
battle. The stat parameters are based on the
official Marvel power grid from which the DC

251
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:37,920
characters statistics are extrapolated.
Additional stat categories are included such as

252
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:43,460
range, damage potential, versatility and
perception in order to create a more detailed and

253
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:48,820
accurate simulation. The results of the 1000
simulations provide a percentage of wins for each

254
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,380
character. The contestant with the higher
percentage is declared the victor as they have a

255
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:58,700
higher probability to win any given battle. In an
equitable pairing, neither character should win

256
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:04,020
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat

257
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:08,500
Superman, so the confidence rate of my method
falls in line with the precedents that have been

258
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,340
established in the source material. My
mathematical simulations are without

259
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:17,900
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for

260
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:23,180
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K.
Before we run the simulations, though, we'd like

261
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:27,540
to break down each character's histories and
abilities before improvising a scenario on how we

262
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:32,880
imagine one of the 1000 simulations would play out
beat for beat. And I believe it's my turn to go first

263
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,940
with the Marvel characters backstory, so let me
tell you all about Gore the God Butcher. Gore was

264
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:45,160
born with a crippled leg on an unnamed desert world
whose twin sons scorched the ground and whose

265
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:50,980
knights were stalked by leathery predators. His
tribe taught that droughts, quakes, and famine

266
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:57,120
were divine tests and that prayer and sacrifice
would bring relief, yet no deliverance came. His

267
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,620
father died of sun fever, his mother was taken by
beasts, and every one of his children was claimed

268
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:09,220
by starvation or tremors. A violent quake crushed
his pregnant mate, Ara, leaving only their son,

269
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:15,600
Agar. When famine finally seized the boy during a
desperate march toward a rumored fertile land,

270
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,180
Gore buried the child, a forbidden act according
to his tribe, and renounced the gods. For

271
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:27,360
blasphemy, his people stoned him and left him to
die in the wasteland. Alone and dehydrated, Gore

272
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:34,680
saw two armored figures streak across the sky and
crash nearby. One shone gold, the other was a

273
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:40,320
living shadow wielding a black shifting sword.
The shadow was Null, an ancient evil you could

274
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,820
learn more about in his duel against White
Lantern. Null's weapon, all black, the Necro

275
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:50,720
Sword, was the first symbiote that the deity had
created, a thinking mass of liquid darkness that

276
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:57,460
bonds with hosts and feeds on rage. The gold god
begged Gore for help, but in realizing gods were

277
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:04,460
real and had ignored his family, Gore's sorrow
became fury. The Necro Sword slipped from Null,

278
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:10,200
wrapped around Gore's arm, and hardened into a
spear. With it, Gore slew the gold god, felt the

279
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:15,580
symbiote's darkness join with him, and swore to
butcher every deity in existence. While Null

280
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:20,460
could have pursued his weapon, he instead allowed
Gore to wield the all black, recognizing the

281
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:25,660
mortal's vengeful heart as a mirror of his own
hatred for the light. All black granted Gore

282
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:30,740
flight, super strength, and rapid healing. He
could mold the symbiote into armor or weapons at

283
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:36,360
will. He also shaped black berserkers, large
shadow creatures that obeyed him. For thousands

284
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:42,240
of years, Gore traveled from world to world,
murdering gods of war, harvest, song, and even

285
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,460
flowers. Convinced the universe would be kinder
without beings who demanded worship while

286
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:53,560
allowing suffering. During the Viking Age, Gore
reached Earth. Thor Odinson, then a brash young

287
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:58,960
god of thunder, found a dead North American deity
on an Icelandic beach and tracked the killer to

288
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:06,870
Russia, where the sl- Gorr ambushed Thor, chained
him inside a cave, and tortured him for 17 days,

289
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:12,150
demanding that Thor reveal the path to Asgard. A
band of vikings stormed the cave, distracting

290
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:17,570
Gorr long enough for Thor to sever his arm with his
own axe, yarn-borne, and strike Gorr with

291
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:22,850
lightning. Gorr survived and fled, determined
never to be weak again. You can learn more about

292
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:28,670
Thor in his duel against Wonder Woman. Seeking
greater power, Gorr attacked Kronix, a palace

293
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:34,530
guarded by the Time Gods. After killing its
defenders, he entered their pool of raw time to

294
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:40,590
travel through history. At the dawn of creation,
he slew one of the first Elder Gods and ripped out

295
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:46,770
its glowing heart. Far in a future timeline, he
captured gods from every pantheon he could reach.

296
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:54,050
Only an elderly King Thor, last ruler of Asgard,
remained free, caged yet unbroken. Gorr forced

297
00:28:54,050 --> 00:29:00,210
his prisoners to mine star cores in order to build
the God Bomb, a device that would wipe out every god

298
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:06,030
in every era through time. Back in the present,
Thor noticed prayers going unanswered and

299
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:11,630
followed the trail to Gorr's fortress, where he
was caught and chained beside his older self.

300
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:17,010
Black berserkers then seized the Viking Age Thor
so the butcher could parade three versions of the

301
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:23,190
same deity before his ultimate victory. The Thors
escaped and hurled a fragment of a star at the God

302
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:28,890
Bomb, but Gorr survived. To supercharge all
black, he ordered his berserkers to slaughter his

303
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:35,030
enslaved gods, feeding their energy to the sword
and making himself unstoppable. Gorr used all

304
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:41,030
black to create copies of his former wife and kid,
Ara and Agar, for company. When the Ara construct

305
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:47,770
called him, my god, he vaporized her in rage. The
Agar construct horrified, freed Thor the

306
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:53,570
Avenger, and begged him to stop his father. Gorr
hurled the young Thor into space, activated the

307
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:59,530
God Bomb, and waited for Divinity to die. As the
Bomb detonated, the surviving gods of every

308
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:05,310
timeline prayed in unison. Their faith flooded
Thor the Avenger, and wielding both his own hammer

309
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:10,750
Mjolnir and King Thor's future Mjolnir, he
battled the butcher across a dying moon. The

310
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:17,750
youngest Thor struck the final blow, beheading
Gorr and ending a 3000 year crusade. Though dead,

311
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:23,430
the all black sword, carrying a copy of Gorr's
mind, endured. Years later, the spy Nick Fury

312
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:29,350
whispered a secret in Thor's ear learned from
their murdered watcher Uatu, telling Thor, Gorr

313
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:34,370
was right. You can learn more about the watcher in
his duel against the Monitor. Doubt washed over

314
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:40,230
Thor so much so that he became unworthy to lift
Mjolnir. During a war between the Norse realms,

315
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:45,450
the Dark Elf Malachith bonded with the blade and
called himself the Butcher of Thors until Thor

316
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:50,490
defeated him. You can learn more about Malachith
in his duel against Eclipso. Far in the future,

317
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:57,010
millions of years later, King Loki merged with all
black and rebuilt Gorr's body from living shadow,

318
00:30:57,010 --> 00:31:01,830
setting him against an immortal all father Thor.
You can learn more about Loki in his duel against

319
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:07,790
Ares. Gorr crucified Loki and Thor on spires of
darkness and tried to spread the sword's darkness

320
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:14,530
across every star. Thor's granddaughters, Atle,
Elisive, and Frig, freed their grandfather and

321
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:21,010
rallied gods saved long ago by Thor. Atle severed
Gorr's head, but it was only a shell. All black's

322
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:27,390
darkness had woven itself into the very fabric of
space. Loki stalled Gorr by reciting every heroic

323
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:33,310
deed Thor had ever performed. The endless tale
bought time for Thor to release the god Tempest, a

324
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:39,770
cosmic storm trapped inside Mjolnir. The Tempest
shredded all black. Stripped of power, amnesiac

325
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:45,930
and raving, Gorr was left mortal. The Sky Lords of
Indigar, the same planet whose rescued gods had

326
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:52,590
once prayed for Thor, took Goren to live as a simple
farmer. Yet the Necro Swords residue had replaced

327
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:59,450
Gorr's heart. Memories crept back in and with them
his hatred, restoring him in the present day.

328
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:04,610
Fixating on Jean Grey, newly reborn as the
Phoenix, Gorr ambushed and killed her on the

329
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:10,450
barren planet Dogar. The Phoenix resurrected her
instantly, overwhelmed Gorr and ignited and

330
00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:16,890
collapsed his dark heart, transforming it into a
newborn star so that at last, Gorr would give life

331
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:22,350
instead of taking it. You can learn more about the
Phoenix in her duel against Raven. And that's Gorr

332
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:28,210
the God Butcher's history. Powers-wise, Gorr is a
mortal alien whose heart was replaced with the

333
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:33,170
darkness of all black, the Necro Sword, a
primordial weapon composed of living abyss,

334
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:38,570
forged by the primordial entity Null using
celestial energy. Though the Necro Sword was

335
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:44,310
returned to Null's hands, Gorr can still use the
portion of living abyss that is now part of him. He

336
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:49,610
can shape this darkness to his will to form
constructs such as weapons like spears or a sword,

337
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:56,030
which is its preferred form. Gorr often uses it to
form a cloak that can create armor or wings or even

338
00:32:56,030 --> 00:33:01,330
semi-sentient wolf lizard insectoid
hybrid-like creatures called black berserkers.

339
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:06,690
The living abyss grant Gorr strength enough to
lift over 100 tons in vulnerability, increased

340
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:12,110
speed, regenerative healing, and immortality.
Having lived for millennia, waging combat

341
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:18,310
against deities, he has become an adept
combatant. And that's Gorr. Gotcha. So you know,

342
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:23,130
like if it takes three different thorns to defeat
Gorr the God Butcher, Guy Gardner has his fucking

343
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:28,270
work cut out for him, doesn't he? I mean, not
really. One Green Lantern can easily take on three

344
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:34,070
thorns. What? Yeah, you heard me. I could have less
respect for you than I do right now. Just want to let

345
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:40,810
you know. I am okay with that. I'll get it back when I
win the duel, you know? Let me tell you about Green

346
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:46,410
Lantern Guy Gardner. Now Guy Gardner was born in
Baltimore, Maryland to a turbulent household

347
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:52,810
dominated by his abusive alcoholic father.
Frequently compared unfavorably to his older

348
00:33:52,810 --> 00:33:58,330
brother, Mace, Guy developed a tough and
combative personality to shield himself from

349
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:03,490
constant ridicule and physical abuse. Despite
the toxic home environment, he showed potential

350
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:09,310
both intellectually and athletically earning a
scholarship to the University of Michigan. There

351
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:15,770
he studied education and psychology and played
football until a career ending knee injury forced

352
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:22,510
him to refocus on academics. He eventually became
a social worker and later a teacher working with

353
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:28,790
troubled youth, driven by a desire to help those in
need escape the kind of upbringing he endured.

354
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:35,250
Unbeknownst to him, Guy possessed the qualities
necessary to become a Green Lantern, willpower,

355
00:34:35,250 --> 00:34:42,409
courage, and a strong sense of justice. When the
Green Lantern of sector 2814, Abin Sewer, crashed

356
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:50,210
on earth and lay dying, his ring identified two
worthy successors, Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner.

357
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:55,750
Jordan, being closer, was chosen. Gardner became
the backup Green Lantern, though he only learned

358
00:34:55,750 --> 00:35:00,450
of this years later when the Guardians of the
Universe, the creators of the Green Lanterns,

359
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:06,110
informed him directly in an admission that
wounded his pride and fueled his lifelong rivalry

360
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:12,890
with Hal Jordan. You can learn more about how NRI
Green Lantern versus Nova dual episode. After

361
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:18,290
learning of his alternate selection, Guy trained
to serve as Hal's substitute in the event of his

362
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:24,330
incapacitation. He eventually received his own
Green Lantern ring and joined the Corps. Though

363
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:29,230
his attitude and temperament often clashed with
the more disciplined members, his effectiveness

364
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:35,010
in battle earned him a reluctant respect.
Initially assigned as Hal's backup, Guy took on

365
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:40,710
more responsibility following Hal's frequent
off-world duties. His first major outing came

366
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:45,950
when Hal was captured by Sinestro and taken to the
Anti-Matter Universe of Corde. The Guardians

367
00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:51,550
activated Guy's ring and directed him to rescue
Hal, but he was intercepted and captured by

368
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:57,550
Sinestro's forces. Subjected to mental torture,
Guy was presumed dead when the Guardians lost

369
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:02,410
contact with him. Eventually rescued and
returned to earth, Guy suffered severe

370
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:08,510
psychological trauma and was placed in a comatose
state. He remained that way for several years

371
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:13,710
until the crisis on Infinite Earth's event when
the Guardians reactivated him as one of Earth's

372
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:19,650
Green Lanterns. Though he awoke, the mental
damage had altered his personality. He emerged

373
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:26,250
more arrogant, aggressive, and unpredictable.
The change was partially due to brain damage,

374
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:31,650
which affected his emotional regulation and
heightened his volatility, making him a wild card

375
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:37,570
among the Corps. When the Guardians later decided
to leave the Universe and choose successors, Guy

376
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:42,950
was given a ring and declared the official Green
Lantern of Earth. However, his bombastic

377
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:48,250
demeanor and combative style often put him at odds
with his peers, especially Hal Jordan, John

378
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:53,650
Stewart, and Batman. He joined the newly reformed
Justice League International, a more

379
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:59,330
politically driven version of the League, where
his brash personality acted as a constant source

380
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:05,150
of tension. Despite this, he became a core member
of the team and formed a unique rapport with heroes

381
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:10,790
like Booster Gold and Blue Beetle. You can learn
more about the Justice League in our team duel,

382
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:16,230
Justice League vs. Avengers. His time with the
League included several humiliations, most

383
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:21,510
famously being knocked out by a single punch from
Batman, but also triumphs, including

384
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:26,610
commissions to apocalypse, battles against
despair and defending Earth from alien

385
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:32,870
invasions. His overconfidence and crude sense of
humor masked a deep need for validation and a

386
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:38,890
fierce loyalty to his team. After Hal's
transformation into parallax, Guy lost his ring

387
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:44,090
during the destruction of the central power
battery. Refusing to stand idle, he saw

388
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:50,830
alternative means to remain a hero. He embarked on
a quest to acquire Sinestro's yellow power ring,

389
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:56,070
and when he was successful, he used it to continue
fighting crime, though the ring proved unstable

390
00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:02,930
and more difficult to control. Seeking greater
power, Guy ventured into the alien realm of Kord

391
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:09,750
and later tapped into a mysterious inner energy
linked to his DNA. This transformation turned him

392
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:17,190
into Warrior, a being capable of morphing his body
into weapons and armor. The source of his power was

393
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:23,050
revealed to be his descent from an alien race
called the Vuldarians. Biologically engineered

394
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:28,830
shapeshifting warriors bred for combat.
Embracing his new identity, Guy became the

395
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:36,290
proprietor of a bar for heroes called Warriors.
Eventually his Vuldarian powers faded and Guy

396
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:42,170
returned to using the green lantern ring when the
core was restored. He served as a senior lantern

397
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:48,130
alongside Kyle Rainer, John Stewart and Hel
Jordan, operating out of Oa and protecting sector

398
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:54,950
2814. He also worked closely with the Honor Guard,
the elite leadership force of the core, and

399
00:38:54,950 --> 00:39:00,330
participated in campaigns during the Rand
Thanagar war and the Sinestro core war, where he

400
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:05,610
fought valiantly against yellow lanterns and
other cosmic threats. In the post-flashpoint

401
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:11,770
timeline, Guy Gardner remained a green lantern
and continued to be depicted as one prone to acting

402
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:17,710
before thinking, but with unwavering courage and
a strong moral compass. He served with

403
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:22,870
distinction in the green lantern core and took
part in major battles, including defending Oa

404
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:28,510
from the invading red lantern core. During this
campaign, he was briefly possessed by a red

405
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:34,970
lantern ring drawn to the deep well of rage within
him. The experience left a lasting impression.

406
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:40,130
When Atrocidus, the founder of the red lanterns,
launched a new assault on earth, Guy volunteered

407
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:46,010
to infiltrate the red lantern core as a double
agent. You could learn more about red lanterns in

408
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:52,610
our Atrocidus vs Juggernaut dual episode. The
power of the red ring proved to be too seductive,

409
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:58,510
and Guy's infiltration turned into a reluctant
allegiance. Eventually, he embraced the

410
00:39:58,510 --> 00:40:04,210
identity of a red lantern fully and became their
field leader, bearing their crimson sigil and

411
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:09,210
maintaining order among the volatile ranks.
Under Guy's leadership, the red lanterns

412
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:14,190
transformed from a brutal militia into a more
structured force focused on dispensing

413
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:19,290
vengeance and protecting the oppressed. He
developed a complex but mutual respect with

414
00:40:19,290 --> 00:40:25,670
Atrocidus' rival, Gules, and established a red
lantern base of operations on earth, though he

415
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:30,530
struggled with controlling his rage-fueled
powers. After several adventures including

416
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:36,210
cosmic conflicts and battles against shadowy
manipulators like the Shadow Thief and the Shadow

417
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:42,190
Market, Guy relinquished his red ring and
returned to the green lantern core. He served on

418
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:48,110
Mojo, the sentient planet that for a time acted as
the core's HQ, helping train new recruits and

419
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:53,290
operating as a senior lantern within the honor
guard. When the green lantern core was merged with

420
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:58,690
the Sinestro core during a fragile alliance
brokered by Hal Jordan and Saurinik Natu, a yellow

421
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:04,890
lantern, Guy was among the few green lanterns who
attempted to make peace with the yellow lanterns.

422
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:10,210
His unlikely friendship with the reformed
Arquillo, a hulking brute and enforcer from the

423
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:15,610
Sinestro core, who's often compared to Kilowag,
became a standout moment during this period as the

424
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:20,910
two warriors bonded over their mutual love of
brawling and begrudging respect for one

425
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:26,210
another's strength. That's Guy Gardner's
backstory. Powers-wise, Guy Gardner wields a

426
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:31,910
green lantern power ring fueled by willpower,
granting him the ability to generate solid, light

427
00:41:31,910 --> 00:41:37,970
constructs, fly, generate force fields, and
survive in space. His constructs often reflect

428
00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:43,970
his brash personality, manifesting as blunt
force weapons like fists, bats, and hammers. For a

429
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:49,810
time, his Vulderian DNA allowed him to shape shift
parts of his body into weapons and armor, giving

430
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:55,670
him enhanced strength and durability. Even
without powers, Guy is a trained hand-to-hand

431
00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:00,890
fighter. Wait, so does he have his Vulderian
powers or does he not? Technically, he still has

432
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:08,270
his Vulderian DNA, though he hasn't used it since
like the early 2000s. What you said he has the DNA

433
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:14,330
but that his powers like disappeared over time. It
was during the green lantern rebirth storyline

434
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:19,510
where like he went through like this tremendous
amount of pain where it seemed like his DNA was

435
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:25,130
rejecting his body or something like that, but
that was all quelled once a green lantern ring flew

436
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:31,530
onto his finger and he emerged once again as a green
lantern. So it didn't leave his body, it's still

437
00:42:31,530 --> 00:42:37,770
there. Again, he just hasn't made use of it. And
will he have a red ring in this match or just the

438
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:43,470
green? I'm going with his traditional green ring,
although I loved the fact that he was a red lantern

439
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:48,450
for a time. I thought he made a fantastic red
lantern. I thought a red lantern ring couldn't be

440
00:42:48,450 --> 00:42:53,410
removed from a red lantern without killing them.
There have been a few instances where they've been

441
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:58,770
able to circumvent that, particularly when
there's a, I think it's a blue lantern is present.

442
00:42:58,770 --> 00:43:02,550
Interesting. Okay. Okay. I don't know why I'm
asking so many questions because I don't care

443
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:14,710
because this dude's going down. Oh, we'll see. In a
world where fantasies collide and heroes clash,

451
00:43:59,650 --> 00:44:03,810
we've got their histories and abilities out of the
way, let's speculate on how one of the 1000

452
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:09,470
simulated matches will go. The winner is
determined by simulations, not the speculation,

453
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:15,470
but it's fun to imagine how the fight could play
out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?

454
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:20,230
Well, I should say there are no rules other than the
characters have no prior knowledge of the other

455
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:24,990
going into the fight. All they are aware of
starting out is that the other character is a

456
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:29,330
threat that needs to be eliminated. For the
speculation, the contestants will begin

457
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:34,730
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript
environment that will have no bearing on the match

458
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:39,650
itself, as no environmental statistics are
considered in my simulations. The contestants

459
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:45,130
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright,
then let's get into it. Green Lantern and Gore the

460
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:51,830
God Butcher meet on the battlefield. Who goes
first? I'm actually gonna say Guy starts off, and

461
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:59,290
he's gonna do so by undoing his belt buckle,
pulling down his pants. Moaning, Gore, while

462
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:06,610
giving him the middle finger. Gore is unamused.
Oh, but Guy is, so. Well, this amusement is gonna

463
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:12,550
turn into pure shock when all of a sudden he finds a
dark tendril up his pooper. But that's exactly

464
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:19,930
what Guy wanted to happen, because while Gore was
distracted by Guy's ass, Guy's gonna generate a

465
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:26,250
pit bull behind Gore that's gonna chomp down on his
ankle, while Guy, meanwhile, is gonna block that

466
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:31,930
black tendril with the green toilet that flushes
that tendril and that's plumbing just redirects

467
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:39,690
it right into the ground. Alright, I'm gonna say
first of all, Gore was not distracted by Guy's ass.

468
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:45,550
Sure, I will say that he does take a second to
straight up murder the pit bull construct. Oh,

469
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:50,910
shit. He's using his necrosaur to cleave it in half
from its jaws. Then Gore creates his own

470
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:57,090
creatures, a pair of black berserkers that chase
down Guy like a couple of rabid wolves that just

471
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:03,110
devour him alive. Okay, but I'm gonna say that
these creatures are gonna be blocked by a row of

472
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:10,310
giant sized football defensive linemen, and from
behind them, Guy's gonna generate a football and

473
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:17,110
hurl it straight towards Gore with perfect aim,
and it's gonna explode upon contact because it was

474
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:23,110
actually a bomb. And that's gonna send Gore flying
backward while Guy does a touchdown dance. A

475
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:29,830
football bomb? Sure. Sure. Yeah, sure. I'm not
sure what kind of football explosion would

476
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:36,890
actually even hurt Gore, but I know that he's
already fucking had it with Guy's shenanigans. So

477
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:44,170
Gore instantly recovers from this football bomb
and blitzes Guy sword first with enough force to

478
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:48,870
cut through a freaking sun. And he straight up
flies through any sort of defensive constructs

479
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:53,930
that Guy creates to protect himself, and Gore
slices right through Guy himself like a dark

480
00:46:53,930 --> 00:47:00,010
bullet train. Oh no, Guy doesn't generate
anything to block this attack. Instead, he's

481
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:06,990
gonna hold up a green cape that hides his body, and
as Gore slices through it, Guy dodges to the side

482
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:14,130
like a matador, shouting, Toro! And Gore's gonna
fly right past him. But Guy, he's immediately

483
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:21,910
gonna hurl a lasso after him, catching Gore by the
ankles before proceeding to quickly hog tie him,

484
00:47:21,910 --> 00:47:29,350
all while wearing a cowboy hat and bandana by the
way. Guy is annoying. But do you think that Gore is

485
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:36,330
just limited to his arms and legs? Even if Guy
manages to restrain Gore's limbs, Gore is just

486
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:42,210
gonna create a dozen more of them out of living
abyss. And all these extra limbs, they're like

487
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:48,030
scorpion tails, and they each simultaneously
reach out and impale Guy from all directions on

488
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:53,890
their stingers. Actually, two of them form blades
that free Gore from his bindings, but the rest of

489
00:47:53,890 --> 00:48:01,450
them impale Guy. They like stab through him with
long stingers? Yeah. Okay, so Guy probably falls

490
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:08,390
to his knees, but before he can get stabbed again,
he's gonna generate a dozen chainsaws that are

491
00:48:08,390 --> 00:48:14,450
gonna sever the scorpion tails. And just as Gore
frees himself from the lasso while Guy is still on

492
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:20,970
his knees, a giant green fist with brass knuckles
is gonna plow into Gore. Wait, wait, Guy should be

493
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:26,930
dead from getting impaled a dozen times. Well,
actually Guy has like weird organs due to his

494
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:33,390
Vulderian DNA, like he has two hearts, and he could
also heal rapidly because of his shapeshifting

495
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:40,090
nature. So yeah, he's hurt, but he'll be fine.
That's so weird. But you know what, it doesn't

496
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:46,570
matter because even if Gore gets punched by this
fist construct, the stingers that Gore stabbed

497
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:52,270
into Guy Gardener, they left this dark residue
within Guy's body. So it doesn't matter what the

498
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:57,570
hell Guy's organs look like on the inside, because
it's all just infested with shadowy maggots that

499
00:48:57,570 --> 00:49:04,070
feast on his body in just like a matter of seconds.
And it looks like Guy gets covered in darkness, but

500
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:09,470
then he just dissolves into nothing. Well, again,
you know, Guy's Vulderian shapeshifting body

501
00:49:09,470 --> 00:49:17,050
will just shift those maggots into a Gatling gun
that he transforms his other arm into that's not

502
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:24,010
armed with a ring, and he's going to fire those
maggots right back at Gore, which I don't know,

503
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:28,130
probably isn't gonna hurt him. Yeah, Gore would
just absorb them into the rest of his living

504
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:33,190
darkness. But once the maggots are done, he's
gonna transform his Gatling gun into a grenade

505
00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:39,670
launcher, and he's gonna launch a nuclear level
implosive grenade that's just gonna leave Gore a

506
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:45,270
dark stain on the ground. What the fuck is an
implosive nuclear grenade? I guess the technical

507
00:49:45,270 --> 00:49:52,050
term would be a Vulderian Fragmite bomb? I don't
know, it has like the destructive force of a nuke,

508
00:49:52,050 --> 00:50:00,490
but it sucks things up like a mini black hole. It's
from the comics. Okay. Well, Gore blocks the bomb

509
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:06,950
with his cloak, so that when it goes off, when it
implodes, it just pulls in all of the living abyss,

510
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:13,950
like all of that gets sucked into the implosion.
But Gore himself is still left standing. And Guy,

511
00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:18,290
in all of his cockiness, you know, he didn't
anticipate this. So as the living darkness

512
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:24,210
dissipates from the bomb, Guy is not paying
attention. He's assuming Gore was imploded to,

513
00:50:24,210 --> 00:50:31,070
and then all of a sudden he gets fucking rocked
right in his nose by Gore, who is now mortal. And

514
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:36,390
since getting punched in the nose real hard is
apparently Guy's weakness, you know, he falls to

515
00:50:36,390 --> 00:50:43,050
the ground, just completely knocked out, and he
loses the match. Fuck. You know, I can't even say

516
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:51,530
that wouldn't happen. I guess we'll leave it
there. Either Guy defeats Gore with some

517
00:50:51,530 --> 00:50:59,150
Vulderian Fragmite bombs, or Gore just knocks Guy
out with a sucker punch to the face, apparently.

518
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:03,070
Well, let's find out which of these scenarios
happens by running the stats on these characters,

519
00:51:03,070 --> 00:51:09,530
running the simulations, and coming back with a
winner. AG9K, hit it. Inputting data, running

520
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:15,350
calculations, processing results, simulations
complete. All right, this didn't turn out to be

521
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:21,850
quite the repeat of the White Lantern vs. Null dual
episode that I thought it was going to be. I think we

522
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:26,790
managed to do a pretty good job of differentiating
these two matches. Yeah, it wasn't hard,

523
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:32,070
honestly, with Guy. He's kind of different from
other Green Lanterns, not only in terms of his

524
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:39,190
brashness and attitude, but also in terms of his
physiology. You know, he's part Vulderian, and I

525
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:45,750
didn't want to play that up into the stats too much.
I still think his ring is his primary weapon. But he

526
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:51,910
has contingencies, we'll say. And that is what
gave him the edge in versatility over Gore the God

527
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:58,010
Butcher. You know, as versatile as Gore is with his
Necro sword. And he does some interesting things

528
00:51:58,010 --> 00:52:03,050
with it, like he used it to create the God Bomb and
stuff like that. But largely he sticks with swords

529
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:08,750
and tendrils and dark creatures and stuff
compared to a Green Lantern ring, which Guy tends

530
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:14,750
to get a little bit more creative with, again, in
addition to his alien DNA. The two did share a lot of

531
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:18,790
similarities when it came to the stats, though we
both said they were equally fast, equally

532
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:25,020
evasive. When it came to strength and damage level
and range, they were also on par with each other. We

533
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:29,990
did give the fighting skill edge to Gore the God
Butcher just because he has millennia of fighting

534
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:36,410
experience. And we also said that longevity meant
he was smarter than Guy, who's kind of dumb. Yeah,

535
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:42,210
he's definitely done some really dumb stuff in the
comics. But we did give Guy the edge in perception

536
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:49,070
because Green Lantern rings can scan things and
give the bear added information. Yeah, there

537
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:53,530
weren't too many perception feats for Gore the God
Butcher. With all that said, Jonathan, who's

538
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:59,130
taken home the win here? I got to give it to Guy. I
think his versatility is going to give him the edge

539
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:07,050
here. And it looks like our Instagram poll takers
agree with me, just barely though, because 52% of

540
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:13,450
our poll takers voted in favor of Guy. That's one of
the closest polls I think we've put out there.

541
00:53:13,450 --> 00:53:19,030
Yeah, really close. So it seems like this is a
pretty good match up in our followers' eyes. But

542
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:25,030
let's find out who actually won. AJ9K, the results
please. Hey, you are, sir. All right, the winner

543
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:36,170
between Green Lantern, Guy Gardner, and Gore the
God Butcher is... Gore the God Butcher. Damn it!

544
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:42,670
Looks like Guy Gardner got sucka punched right the
fuck out. As a matter of fact, Deadpool came out

545
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:49,470
when this match was over and told Guy Gardner that
he got knocked the fuck out. At a 1000 matches, Gore

546
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:58,790
the God Butcher won 571, whereas Green Lantern
only won 429. Really? Okay, I thought that was

547
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:04,510
going to be a little bit closer. I thought this was
essentially going to be a coin toss. And I am kind of

548
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:11,810
said that it again, Guy is not my favorite Green
Lantern, but I also just really hate Gore. Why?

549
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:17,350
What's wrong with Gore? He deserves this. Did you
see how they massacred my boy in Thor 11 Thunder?

550
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:23,930
Yeah, that's why I don't like him. That whole
movie, just everything about it is awful. Well,

551
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:30,630
maybe Superman will be bad and you'll hate Guy even
more too. Yeah, no, that's not going to happen. But

552
00:54:30,630 --> 00:55:02,970
that does it for this duel. AJ9K, help close this
out. Max Destruction, Senjo World, and Console

553
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:12,390
Combat. In our next episode, as a tie-in to the 4th
of July holiday, we are doing a fireworks-related

554
00:55:12,390 --> 00:55:19,870
duel with Jubilee versus Static. Yeah, I've been
dying to get a Jubilee duel in here at some point and

555
00:55:19,870 --> 00:55:25,430
the executive producers kind of think of a better
time than around the 4th of July. And I agree. But

556
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:29,850
that does it for this episode. You want to give a big
thanks to our executive producers, John

557
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:34,230
Staroski, Zachary Hepburn, Dustin Belcombe,
Mickey Muthengian, Nathaniel Wagner, Levi

558
00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:40,010
Yatyn, Austin Wizelowski, AJ Dunkerly, Nick
Ibonto, Scott Kamacho, Gil Kamacho, Adam Spees,

559
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:45,610
Dean Maleski, Devin Davis, Joseph Kirsting, Josh
Schleiner, Mike Williams, Oscar Gabas, and Paul

560
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:51,290
Graves for helping make this podcast possible.
And we'll talk to you guys next week. Up, up, and

561
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:57,130
away, true believers. I thought a good tagline for
this episode would be The Gardener vs The Butcher.

562
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:58,970
But then I was like, nah, that's boring.
