00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:27,540
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi and welcome
to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:32,060
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:37,320
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe and I'm his twin

4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,980
brother Johnny DC. And in this episode we're going
to find out who would win in a fight between the two

5
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:50,400
lords of the underworld, Neron from DC and Hela
from Marvel. Now listeners are probably familiar

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:58,320
with both of these characters. Hela was the main
antagonist in Dora Gnarok and Neron was a freaking

7
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:04,120
horrifying character in the Arrowverse. Oh I
didn't even know that he was in that show. Yeah

8
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:12,740
don't Google it, he looks freaking gross. I'm
googling it right now, Neron Arrowverse. What the

9
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:20,260
fuck is that? Exactly. I regret googling that, you
should have warned me. I literally did. He doesn't

10
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:25,540
look anything like the comic book character. No.
It's one of those weird Arrowverse adaptations.

11
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:32,400
Okay. Yeah basically it's a demon from hell versus
the Norse god of death. My money's on the Norse god

12
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:39,280
of death. Everybody knows that hell with two L's is
superior to hell with one. Before we get into that

13
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,620
matchup guys we're going to break down the latest
comic book movie news to come out from this past

14
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:49,080
week, uh which there was none. Likely because
we're just coming off of New York Comic when the

15
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,740
studios gave their latest updates on all the
existing projects. So we'll have to wait a few more

16
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:59,080
weeks for more news. As always though we list our
segment times in our episode description so feel

17
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:03,360
free to check out the show notes if you want to skip

out of the way quick to the no prize. A no prize is an

37
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:54,280
award that Marvel used to give out to fans. Our
version the dynamic dual no prize is a digital

38
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,480
award that we post on Instagram for the person that
we feel gave the best answer to the question of the

39
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:05,500
week. Last week we asked you guys regarding the
Wonder Man and Bat Fam trailers both of which were

40
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:12,420
released during New York Comic Con. What the fuck
did I just watch wrong answers only. And we got no

41
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:17,560
answers for the first time in the history of this
podcast. I think no one called in with their

42
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,460
answer. I blame Jonathan entirely for that. I
thought it was a good question. I did think it would

43
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:28,400
be hard for people because it kind of requires some
creative thinking. Basically the prompt was to

44
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,960
rename the shows based off of your impressions of
each series trailer. And since no one called in

45
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:40,820
with an answer this week's no prize is being
awarded to us. We're giving ourselves the prize.

46
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:45,140
I've always wanted to win a no prize. I've never
been eligible. I got to say it feels pretty damn

47
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:50,620
good. My answers for last week's question of the
week would have been for Wonder Man I would have

48
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:59,080
retitled it the Studio Season 2. And for Bat Fam I
would have retitled it Gotham Knights Season 2

49
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:03,640
because it stars a cast of characters that no one
gives a shit about. Given that we all thought it was

50
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:08,920
going to be a show about the Bat Family as we know it
you know with Nightwing and Red Hood and Batgirl

51
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:15,240
and things like that. And instead we're getting a
Bat Fam show with like the ghost of Ross Hallgool,

52
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,180
Man Bat and a bunch of characters whose names I
can't remember. Yeah just like that CW show that

53
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,560
lasted one season Gotham Knights featuring
characters that no one knew and no one cared about.

54
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,800
That was a good pick. I also liked the Studio Season
2 because that was just a fun show and I definitely

55
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,180
understand like that same behind-the-scenes
approach to Hollywood vibe that you're going for.

56
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:50,180
What would your answers have been? Well for Wonder
Man I would have I think that show is essentially

57
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:55,340
Bat Bluey because it looks like it's for
preschoolers and also I think if it was called Bat

58
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,540
Bluey people would actually watch it. That seems
pretty harsh considering do you liked the Merry

59
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:04,400
Little Batman film? Well I did like it. I also
acknowledged that that was for a younger

60
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,320
demographic so I mean that's not really an insult.
I do want to make it clear to listeners that for as

61
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:16,300
much as we are questioning the initial trailers
for both of these series and maybe even that's not

62
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,380
to say that they're not going to be good. We may end
up enjoying them once we watch them. In fact I'm

63
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:26,500
pretty sure that's going to be the case especially
for Wonder Man. Bat Fam I'm not so sure. I was going

64
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,440
to say the reverse. I'll probably enjoy Bat Fam
with my children but Blunderman and Blah Blah Land

65
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,280
I don't even know if I'm going to tune in for that.
Well that's your loss but congrats to us for

66
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,940
winning this week's No Prize. If you the listener
want a shot at winning your own No Prize go to our

67
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:49,580
website and click that record button next time and
that brings us to our question of the week. Where

68
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:57,080
the fuck were you guys last week? Wrong answers
only. Yeah what were you guys doing last week? Not

69
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:01,720
calling in that's all I know. We want to hear about
it. Give us your best excuse. Again wrong answers

70
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,220
only. Record your answer at dynamicdool.com by
clicking on the red microphone button in the

71
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,620
bottom right hand corner of the screen which will
prompt you to leave us a voicemail. Your message

72
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,420
could be up to 30 seconds long and don't forget to
leave your name in case we include you on the

73
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:19,040
podcast. We'll pick our favorite answer and award
that person a dynamic dual no prize that we'll post

74
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:31,540
to Instagram. Be sure to answer before October
25th. But let's go ahead and get into the main event

75
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:38,820
of this episode where we find out who would win in a
fight between the Lord of Hell, Neron and the Queen

76
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:58,900
of Hell, Hela. Alright Neron versus Hela. Now this
episode is actually an executive producer

77
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,860
special request from Brandon Estregard. He
wanted to find out who'd win in a fight between

78
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,460
these two characters and it was a great request for
the Halloween season considering that Neron is a

79
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:15,300
demon or devil from hell. I don't actually know too
much about the character. He's a demon. A demon?

80
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,720
Okay so he's not like a mafisto? Um. Or I guess
mafisto is a demon. Technically he's a hell lord.

81
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,880
Neron's a hell lord. Okay Hela is also a hell lord.
She's considered one despite the fact that her

82
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:33,580
domain of the underworld only pertains to
escardians and even then it only pertains to

83
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:39,419
escardians who have not died in battle because
escardians who do die in battle go to Valhalla. So

84
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:45,040
it's not a place of torment. It's just no
underworld. No it's not like a realm of fire and

85
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,640
torture and suffering. It's just where
escardians go when they die. Okay that's lame. Not

86
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,780
nearly as metal as Neron. I am interested in
learning how powerful Neron is and how that

87
00:08:56,780 --> 00:09:01,280
compares to Hela so let's go ahead and get into the
backstories. First to explain the methodology

88
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:07,000
behind our duels let's go to our sentient dual
simulator Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K tell our

89
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,960
listeners how you go about determining a winner in
our dual matchups. Yes of course sir. The way I

90
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,760
determine a winner between the contestants is by
running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations using the

91
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,320
character's statistics. A Monte Carlo
simulation is a probabilistic model used to

92
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,540
determine outcomes through random sampling. In
this case I randomize the statistics along a

93
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,660
normal distribution as a way to simulate the many
variables that can occur during battle. The stat

94
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:37,780
parameters are based on the official marvel power
grid from which the DC characters statistics are

95
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:43,180
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are
included such as range, damage potential,

96
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:48,320
versatility and perception in order to create a
more detailed and accurate simulation. The

97
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,040
results of the 1000 simulations provide a
percentage of wins for each character. The

98
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,840
contestant with the higher percentage is
declared the victor as they have a higher

99
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,900
probability to win any given battle. In an
equitable pairing neither character should win

100
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:07,240
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat

101
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:11,700
Superman so the confidence rate of my method falls
in line with the precedents that have been

102
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,560
established in the source material. My
mathematical simulations are without

103
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:21,100
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole
consideration nor are fan votes tabulated for

104
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:27,140
determination of the winner. Thanks AJ9K. Before
we run the simulations though we like to break down

105
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:33,080
each character's histories and abilities before
improvising a scenario on how we imagine one of the

106
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,640
1000 simulations would play out B for beat. And
it's my turn to go first with the DC characters

107
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:45,820
backstory so let me tell you all about Nier on. In
the infernal depths of hell Nier on was once a

108
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:51,360
lesser demon whose cunning and ambition set him
apart from his kin. Through deception and mastery

109
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,500
of infernal law he rose within the demonic
hierarchy, binding both fiends and mortals to his

110
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,920
will through perfectly worded bargains. Over
countless centuries he became renowned for

111
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:08,320
crafting covenants that damned their signers
while strengthening his own dominion. To extend

112
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,240
his reach to the mortal realm he crafted black
candles that when lit would summon him to the

113
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,280
bearer or draw the bearer to his court. Through
these devices Nier on bartered for souls in

114
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:25,880
exchange for granting mortals their hearts
desires each packed designed to twist to his

115
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:32,040
advantage. His mastery of such dealings earned
him titles among the damned. The wish weaver, the

116
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:38,820
lord of lies and the king of hate. From his throne in
hell he turned his gaze toward earth preparing a

117
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:44,420
grand design to expand his infernal power beyond
the boundaries of his realm. Nier on initiated a

118
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:50,500
plan to unleash the underworld by appearing to
five of the flashes rogues. Captain cold, mirror

119
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:55,540
master, heatwave, weather wizard and captain
boomerang convincing them to carry out

120
00:11:55,540 --> 00:12:01,440
synchronized acts of destruction across the
united states. The five explosions arranged in

121
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,960
points of a pentagram killed the rogues in green
fire and opened a passage from hell to earth. You

122
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,600
can learn more about the rogues in their teen dual
episode against the brotherhood of mutants.

123
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,480
Emerging through the flames Nier on offered
countless villains and even some heroes black

124
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,960
candles promising power or fulfillment in
exchange for their souls. Dozens accepted

125
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:29,160
villains were transformed abilities magnified
and desires granted. Nier on's true ambition

126
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:35,480
however was the corruption of a single pure soul
whose fall would magnify his dominion. Many

127
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:41,840
believed he sought superman but Nier on's true
prize was shazam. When the hero offered his soul to

128
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:47,800
save earth and his fellow heroes his selflessness
rendered the contract uncollectable. Bound by

129
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:53,360
the infernal law that required him to honor his
deals exactly as written Nier on was forced to

130
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,540
release his claims. The trickster exploited the
loophole and unraveling Nier on's network in

131
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:04,380
bargains and banishing him back to hell empty
handed. Two years later Nier on resurfaced and

132
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:10,560
resurrected the same five rogues sending them to
terrorize Keystone city. His true target was the

133
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:17,560
flash Wally West whom he drew into hell. Refusing
Wally soul Nier on instead demanded something

134
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:24,760
pure. His love for Linda Park. When Linda offered
her own soul to spare him Nier on intended to use

135
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,380
their combined essence to ascend heaven's gates
by channeling the speed force. But the purity of

136
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:36,160
their love corroded him and affecting his being
with pity and compassion. Desperate to be rid of

137
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,740
the contamination he struck a new bargain. He
restored their love and lives in exchange for

138
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:47,300
bringing the rogues fully back from death. Nier on
honored the deal found vengeance against the

139
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,780
flash for the humiliation. You can learn more
about Wally West in our flash versus speedball

140
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:57,700
episode. Soon after Nier on observed chaos in the
celestial order as the angel Asmodel rebelled

141
00:13:57,700 --> 00:14:04,140
against heaven. Seeing opportunity he allied
with Asmodel's army to seize heaven itself but at

142
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:09,320
the moment of the assault he withdrew support
without explanation and returned to hell. Not

143
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:14,840
long after Trickster again crossed his path
binding Nier on in a new bargain that compelled him

144
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:20,620
to forget the rogues entirely. Nier on agreed and
the Trickster walked away as the one mortal who had

145
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,820
bested him twice. You can learn more about
Trickster in his duel against Toad. When Etchigan

146
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:32,200
manipulated Asmodel's punishment by fusing him
with the unhosted specter force hell erupted into

147
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:38,400
turmoil. The merging froze hell's fires and
unleashed the damned upon the earth. Nier on used

148
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,960
Superman's body as a vessel to reach the mortal
plane attempting to claim the specter force for

149
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:49,760
himself. The spirit chose hell Jordan instead and
hell's princes punished Nier on for abusing

150
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,520
hell's power for personal gain. They stripped him
of his royal title and cursed him to speak in rhyme

151
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:02,340
demoting him to a lower demonic caste. Determined
to reclaim his crown Nier on trialed through time

152
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:08,440
to seize the souls of Barry Allen, Jason Todd and
Superman at the moments of their deaths. He

153
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,340
captured the first two but Superman's purity
defied him. When Nier on erased dead man's memory

154
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:20,180
to prevent interference the specter restored it
exposing the scheme. Nier on failed but

155
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:25,920
maneuvered through infernal politics to regain
his powers and status. From hell's throne he

156
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,960
turned again toward earth. Nier on empowered
Felix Faust to masquerade as Dr. Fate luring Ralph

157
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,120
Dibney into a ritual that promised the
resurrection of his wife Sue. When Nier on

158
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,780
appeared to claim Ralph's soul Ralph activated a
binding circle that trapped them both inside the

159
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:49,460
tower of fate. Nier on killed him only to find the
binding unbreakable by any but its creator.

160
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:54,540
Eventually Nier on escaped and resumed his
bargains transforming Eddie Bloomberg into a

161
00:15:54,540 --> 00:16:01,040
demonic metihuman known as Kid Devil. Nier on's
pact was conditional if Eddie lost faith in blue

162
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:07,280
devil his soul would be forfeit at age 18. Years
later Eddie discovered blue devils and winning

163
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:13,540
role in his aunt's death and lost faith fulfilling
Nier on's expectation. War soon erupted in the

164
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:19,920
underworld when Blaze and Satanus the twin rulers
of purgatory invaded hell promising hope and

165
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,880
redemption to the damned. Nier on rallied his
armies summoning Lilith's monstrous offspring

166
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:31,100
to his side as victory neared Satanus unleashed a
modified demon plague activated by the word

167
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:36,820
Shazam. The spell transformed demons into
soulless humans perjuring centuries of devoured

168
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:42,880
entities from Nier on's body. Script of power he
was beheaded and Blaze usurped her brother to

169
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:48,280
claim hell's throne. Though dethroned Nier on's
influence persisted through artifacts he had

170
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:54,060
forged on earth including Ocean Master's Trident
and a get out of hell free card that circulated

171
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:59,740
among mortals desperate to cheat damnation. In
post flashpoint continuity Nier on claimed

172
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:05,660
hell's throne after Lucifer abdicated and set his
sights on earth once more. He overthrew Papa

173
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:10,940
Midnight's operations and repurposed
Midnight's New York City club as a conduit for his

174
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:17,260
growing influence intent on seizing control of
New York as the first step in conquering the world.

175
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:22,500
When he trapped both Midnight and John
Constantine in hell Constantine escaped and

176
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:27,800
dismantled Nier on's plan by exploiting a
loophole in Nier on's own hex forcing the demon

177
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,800
back to his realm. You can learn more about
Constantine in our John Constantine vs brother

178
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:39,060
voodoo episode. Later Nier on captured the solar
powered hero Apollo and imprisoned him within his

179
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:44,680
palace baiting his partner Midnighter into hell
for a direct confrontation. Midnighter fought

180
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,860
through demonic hordes and engines of torment to
free Apollo ultimately defeating Nier on in

181
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:55,740
personal combat and costing Nier on his captive
prize. When the great darkness rose to consume the

182
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:02,180
multiverse Nier on was among the infernal lords
enslaved to its will forming parts of the dark army

183
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:07,980
that clashed with the Justice League. After the
heroes severed the darkness's link to reality and

184
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:14,320
later purged its new host Nier on and the others
were freed from its control. In time Nier on was

185
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,340
dethroned by Raven who restored order to hell
displaced again Nier on resumed his dealings in

186
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:25,860
the shadows crafting new packs leaving infernal
contracts and searching for the next soul whose

187
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:31,200
fall might restore his supremacy and that's Nier
on's backstory powers wise Nier on is one of the

188
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:37,240
most powerful demon lords of hell possessing vast
strength and durability he can manipulate

189
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,780
reality through sorcery unleash hellfire and
eldritch force and assume either a regal humanoid

190
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:52,040
guise or his true form a green tentacled mass he can
fly teleport and conjure artifacts of immense

191
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:58,940
power including weapons his defining ability is
contract magic he grants power transformation or

192
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:04,520
resurrection to mortals in exchange for their
souls within his own realm this power grows

193
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:12,460
exponentially and he will reform there if slain
making him immortal so is he shumagorath in his

194
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:18,200
true form not with like the giant eyeball or
anything like that it's more just like a chunky

195
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:26,000
green mass gross you know hella has a true form as
well if her headdress is ever removed she was

196
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,640
actually born like half dead and half alive so like
half of her is beautiful but the other half is

197
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:37,140
basically like a zombie that's her true form
interesting she's severely weakened when in that

198
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,340
state so her headdress is her weakness i will take
note yeah nieran's not gonna know that but let me

199
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:48,280
tell you more about hella in her backstory hella
was mystically born in joenheim the land of the

200
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:53,920
giants as the daughter of the giantess engerbota
and the trickster god Loki whom you can learn more

201
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:59,480
about in his duel with aries some myths claim hella
was the offspring of an earlier incarnation of

202
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:06,480
odin but all accounts agree that she was born half
dead her body split between life and decay as she

203
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,220
came of age odin appointed her the goddess of death
granting her dominion over two of the nine realms

204
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:18,940
hell the land of the dead and niflheim the land of
eternal mist and shadow cloaked in garments that

205
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:24,380
concealed her half-rotted massage she appeared
as a darkly beautiful woman when veiled but

206
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:29,090
beneath the cloak was the withered form of death
itself the garment held Hela held her power and

207
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:34,250
vitality, without it, she became weak and frail.
Though Hela's role was to guide souls of

208
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:39,430
Asgardians and their followers to the afterlife,
her ambition soon exceeded her station. She

209
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:44,510
sought to extend her dominion to Valhalla, the
realm of honored warriors slain in battle, and

210
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:49,830
longed to claim the souls of Odin and his son Thor.
During one of their earliest encounters, she

211
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:55,650
appeared before Thor when he offered his own life
to spare Lady Sif, and impressed by his nobility,

212
00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:00,490
Hela allowed them both to live. Yet her
fascination with Thor persisted, often walking

213
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,510
the line between adversary and reluctant
admirer. You can learn more about Thor in his duel

214
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:11,550
against Wonder Woman. In time, Hela's hunger for
power grew. She stole a fragment of Odin's soul

215
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:16,990
during his slumber upon the Sea of Eternal Night,
using it to create a cosmic entity called

216
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:23,090
Infinity. The being nearly unmade existence
before Hela was defeated by Thor's sacrifice and

217
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:28,630
Odin's intervention. Though Odin slew her to end
her threat, he was persuaded by Thor to resurrect

218
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:34,630
her, restoring the balance between life and
death. Hela continued to test the gods resolve,

219
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:39,690
once slaying Thor only to restore him when Sif
offered her own life in his place. When the

220
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:46,330
monstrous mangog killed Odin, Hela clashed with
Pluto, the Olympian god of death, over the right to

221
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:53,930
claim Odin's soul. To deny Pluto the victory, she
revived Odin herself. Later, alongside Loki, she

222
00:21:53,930 --> 00:22:00,190
attempted to trigger Ragnarok, the apocalyptic
rebirth of Asgard, by slaying Thor's friend Baldr

223
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:05,690
and unleashing an army of monsters upon the realm.
Odin thwarted her scheme, but her obsession with

224
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:10,630
the prophesied end of the gods endured. Hela's
authority was challenged by O'Larris, the

225
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:15,910
unmerciful and Asgardian military commander who
sought to usurp her throne in Hell. The conflict

226
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:20,610
drew the attention of the superhero team, the
defenders, who aided her in repelling O'Larris

227
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:26,270
and restoring order to Valhalla. She later
conspired with Loki and the war god Tyr against

228
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:32,390
Odin and joined the Hell Lords, Mephisto, Pluto,
and Satanish in merging their netherworlds to

229
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:38,510
consolidate power. Their union awakened the
god-eater Demogorge, who devoured Hela and the

230
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:44,530
others before being destroyed by Thor, restoring
her once again. Throughout these eras, Hela's

231
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:49,650
realm served as both prison and battlefield for
divine souls. She commissioned the construction

232
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:55,130
of Naglfar, a massive ship built from the
fingernails of the dead intended to carry her army

233
00:22:55,130 --> 00:23:00,750
across the Nine Realms during Ragnarok. Yet
before it could sail, it was destroyed by Scourge,

234
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:06,830
the executioner who defied her tyranny to save
mortal souls. Hela's repeated attempts to claim

235
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:12,010
Thor's life culminated when she cursed him so that
his wounds would never heal and his body could

236
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:17,450
never die. After a brutal battle with the Midgard
serpent left him mangled, Thor entered Hell

237
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:23,310
within the armor of the destroyer and forced Hela
to lift the curse, restoring his body and trapping

238
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:28,270
the destroyer in her realm as a warning. Even so,
she continued to meddle with mortal and divine

239
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:33,330
affairs, at times battling Mephisto for the right
to claim Thor's soul. You can learn more about

240
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:39,250
Mephisto in his duel against Sandman. When Odin
entered the Odin's sleep, Hela seized the

241
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:45,620
opportunity to expand her influence, corrupting
the Valkyria and turning them into fire demons.

242
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:50,970
Among them was Mirage of the new mutants who
rebelled against her queen. With help from the

243
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:57,070
dwarven King Ytri and the young mutants, Hela's
Uruforge sword called the Night Sword was

244
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:02,690
destroyed, and Odin was spared. You can learn more
about Mirage and Valkyria in their respective

245
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:07,430
duels against Aeroet and Powergirl. When
Ragnarok brought about the fall of the Nine

246
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:14,190
Realms, including Hel in Niflheim, Loki awakened
her in Immortal Guies in Las Vegas. There, she

247
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:19,370
resumed feeding on human souls and aided Loki in
his schemes. During this period, she attended

248
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:24,730
councils with Mephisto, Dormammu, and other Hell
Lords, often shifting alliances based on

249
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:30,410
convenience and survival. Her presence drew the
attention of mutant allies when Mirage sought her

250
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:36,810
aid in battle, gaining from Hela a sword and steed
that allowed her to defeat Ares. Around the same

251
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:42,750
time, Hela accepted the soul of Primhari, the Wolf
Prince of Asgard, who bargained his own life to

252
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:48,450
save his mortal lover and unborn child. After
Asgard was destroyed during an invasion led by

253
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:53,830
Norman Osborn, whom you can learn more about in our
Joker vs Green Goblin duel, many Asgardian souls

254
00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:59,370
were left without a resting place. With no realm to
claim them, the cursed Valkyries, known as the

255
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:04,570
Dessir, began feasting on their spirits. Loki
approached Hela with an offer to restore her

256
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:10,810
dominion. By bargaining with Mephisto, he
granted her a portion of Hell to rule for 1,001

257
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:17,310
years, forming a new Hell, single L, and saving
countless Asgardian souls from oblivion. In

258
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:23,190
exchange, Hela erased Loki's name from the books
of Hell, freeing him from his predestined death.

259
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:28,770
Soon after, the Dessir turned on Hela and attacked
her new domain. In the ensuing battle, her hand was

260
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:34,410
severed and she was forced to absorb the dead into
her body to shield them. With the aid of Thor and

261
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:39,790
Tyr, Hela repelled the Dessir, though the
conflict left her weakened. She later made a pact

262
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:45,650
with Loki and Mephisto during the rise of Odin's
brother, Kul Borson, aka the Serpent, ensuring

263
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:51,190
her realm's protection and pledging her servants
to Loki's cause. When peace returned, she

264
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:56,790
regained the true Hell and reclaimed her place as
its ruler. After Loki restored Hela's severed

265
00:25:56,790 --> 00:26:02,630
hand with the power of the Holy Grail, Hela faced
Angela, the lost daughter of Odin and Freya, in

266
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:08,750
combat. Angela had descended into Hell to free her
lover, Sera, and overcame the Death Goddess. She

267
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:14,670
seized Hela's crown and took her place as Queen of
Hell, before abdicating the throne to Balder.

268
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:20,390
Stripped of power and seeking vengeance, Hela
allied herself with Thanos, the Mad Titan,

269
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:25,930
offering him the one thing he desired most, death
itself, in exchange for his aid in reclaiming her

270
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:31,050
realm. You can learn more about Thanos and his duel
against Darkseid. Together with the Black Order,

271
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:36,470
Hela stole into the collector's vault to retrieve
a version of Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, from a dead

272
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:43,270
universe, only to fail. Returning empty-handed,
Hela slew Proxima midnight before Thanos as proof

273
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:48,610
of her worth and sealed their alliance with a kiss.
You can learn more about the Black Order in their

274
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:54,230
duel against Darkseid's elite. However, Hela's
pact with Thanos eventually brought ruin. When

275
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:59,870
she sought to resurrect him after his death, Hela
succeeded in restoring Thanos' body, but his

276
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:04,810
consciousness was fractured, his mind left
broken by the failed resurrection. During the

277
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:09,210
battle against the Guardians of the Galaxy that
followed on nowhere, Hela commandeered a weapon

278
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:14,910
capable of creating a black hole. Upon firing it,
she was caught in the black hole's collapse,

279
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:19,770
vanishing alongside Thanos into oblivion. You
can learn more about the Guardians of the Galaxy in

280
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:25,110
their duel against Doom Patrol. Hela survived the
void and clawed her way back into existence,

281
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:30,410
reclaiming her throne in Hell. She later joined
forces with Camilla, Queen of the Norns, to defend

282
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:36,970
the realm from Cinder, Queen of Cinders, during a
war among the realms. For strategic reasons, she

283
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:41,710
and Balder agreed to a ceremonial marriage,
though Carnilla ultimately bound herself to Hela

284
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:47,930
in Balder's place, joining the two as reluctant
co-rulers. Together they ruled Hell in an uneasy

285
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:53,310
alliance. You can learn more about Malekith in his
duel against Eclipso. When the Cult of Null on

286
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:58,590
Earth attempted to resurrect the Symbiote God,
she seized his weakened form and siphoned his

287
00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:04,430
power, seeking to command the living darkness
itself and seize control of the Symbiotes. You can

288
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:09,050
learn more about Null in his duel against White
Lantern. And that's her backstory thus far.

289
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:14,610
Powers-wise, Hela has as Guardian Physiology and
Dark Magic as the Goddess of Death. She has

290
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:21,110
God-level strength, able to lift over 100 tons.
She can teleport, run over 100 miles per hour, has

291
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:27,510
vast durability, and is immortal. She can fly,
astral project, cast illusions, manipulate

292
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:33,310
magical energies into blasts or weapon
constructs that can kill even an Asgardian God.

293
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:38,490
Her power over life and death can kill others with a
simple touch. She is formidable in hand-to-hand

294
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:44,190
and weapons combat, particularly with her Night
Sword, which is forged of the same Uru metal that

295
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:49,250
Thor's Hammer Mjolnir is made of. And that's Hela.
Is there anything special about the Night Sword

296
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:56,170
besides it being forged from Uru? I mean, she can
kill people with it. That's lame. So it's just a

297
00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:01,810
plain-ass sword? It's a fucking durable-ass
sword, and she has all these other magical

298
00:29:01,810 --> 00:29:07,930
abilities in conjunction with this badass sword.
I mean, kinda. She's basically Nier on. Don't say

299
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:21,630
that. That's rude. What a rip-off. In a world where
fantasies collide and heroes clash, one podcast

300

speculate on the matches and armed with the power

305
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:59,090
of mathematical simulations discover who will
emerge victorious. Visit dynamicpodcast.com

306
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:07,330
where we settle the debate and settle the score.
Now that we've got their histories and abilities

307
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:12,190
out of the way, let's speculate on how one of the
1000 simulated matches will go. The winner is

308
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:16,870
determined by simulations, not the speculation,
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could play

309
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:23,110
out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?
Well I should say there are no rules, other than the

310
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:27,490
characters have no prior knowledge of the other
going into the fight. All they are aware of

311
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:32,070
starting out is that the other character is a
threat that needs to be eliminated. For the

312
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:37,070
speculation, the contestants will begin
approximately 50 meters apart in a non-descript

313
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:42,130
environment that will have no bearing on the match
itself, as no environmental statistics are

314
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:47,370
considered in my simulations. The contestants
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright then

315
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:53,610
let's get into it. Neron and Hela meet on the
battlefield. Who goes first? I think before even

316
00:30:53,610 --> 00:31:00,110
fighting that Neron is probably going to offer
Hela what she's always wanted, a way to obtain

317
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:07,590
Thor's soul. And to help her with that, he's going
to present her with a black candle that transforms

318
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:15,650
into a glowing green hammer called, let's say, B.
Olner. And that's like 10 times more powerful than

319
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:21,490
Mjolnir and it shoots green lightning because
that's cooler. A hammer that's 10 times more

320
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:26,650
powerful than Mjolnir? Yeah. Well, what happens
if she takes it? What does she give up? That's for

321
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:32,430
Neron to know and for Hela to not find out until it's
too late. So he's just going to present this as a

322
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:39,310
present to her? Yeah. I don't deny that she would
probably be tempted by the offer just for that much

323
00:31:39,310 --> 00:31:46,970
power. She'd probably take him up on it actually.
So she grabs the green hammer, Bjolnir, whatever.

324
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:53,950
She grabs Bjolnir and just wallops the shit out of
Neron with it once she gets it. What an idiot. Okay.

325
00:31:53,950 --> 00:32:00,070
She tries to, but Neron, he's going to go
intangible. So he's just laughing as the hammer

326
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:06,190
swings through him just time after time. And each
time she swings, that actually is going to drain

327
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:12,750
Hela's soul, weakening her while Neron gains her
strength. And that was the twist on his offer. The

328
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:19,710
hammer drains her rather than empowering her. And
with her weakened, that's when he is going to

329
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:25,050
straight up uppercut her and she's going to go
flying towards the horizon, dropping Bjolnir.

330
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:31,310
Okay. Well, first of all, Hela knew that some shady
shit was going to go down. Okay. Obviously she's

331
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:36,930
dealing with the demon, wildswood, your enemy
grant you power. So this was all just a test. Like

332
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:43,610
she split her soul, a fraction of it off before
taking the hammer. So Neron may have drained like

333
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:50,510
1% of her soul's power, but she has power to spare.
So instead of getting knocked to the horizon, when

334
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:56,910
Neron hits her, her body just explodes into a huge
flock of crows. That just fly back together again

335
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:03,310
and they're going to reform back into Hela with 99%
of her soul intact. Wait, wait, she can split her

336
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:10,130
soul? Yeah. She's done it quite a few times in the
comics. Oh, it's like a Horcrux thing. Uh, no, not

337
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:16,710
really. Okay. Well, Neron's probably pissed that
his bargain backfired. We'll say that with the

338
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:22,390
contract avoided, Bjolnir is just going to melt
like candle wax. That's fine. Hela didn't need the

339
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:27,270
hammer. She has her own night sword. So she's going
to manifest it in her hand and she just flies

340
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:33,070
forward lunging at Neron and just running the
sword right through his torso. Oh dang. Okay. So

341
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:40,070
Neron is impaled by the night sword, but these
green flames are going to be flicking out of the

342
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:46,090
sword's entry and exit points because Neron's
hate is so hot that it's going to cause the night

343
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:51,770
sword to burn Hela's hand. That's going to force
her to let go of it. And that's when Neron's going to

344
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:58,230
pull out the sword from his torso and he's going to
imbue her weapon with sentience, transforming it

345
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:05,990
into this Uru armored hell knight that starts
attacking Hela with its sword arms. Okay. A

346
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:12,929
sentient sword hell knight. Hela's going to block
the hell knight's attacks with a magic eldritch

347
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:18,989
shield, but then she summons her own warrior, this
giant spider from her realm of hell. Think like

348
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:25,050
Shalob from Return of the King. That spider
actually serves as a warden in her realm and the

349
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:30,270
spider's going to web up this hell knight so that it
can't even use its swords. Okay. Well, I mean, if

350
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:35,530
Hela's going to start conjuring beings from her
realm, Neron, he's going to summon the four

351
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:41,170
horsemen of the apocalypse and they're going to
circle this giant spider on their horses and just

352
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:47,710
stab it to death before charging Hela and doing the
same. No, except Hela has her own steed and she

353
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:53,870
rises up on it. It's this 15 foot tall wolf, Fenris
wolf, who's just going to pounce on these tiny ass

354
00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:59,330
horsemen and rip them apart just like how a wolf
would do to a herd of baby deer. Oh, you think Fenris

355
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:05,470
is big? Yeah. Neron's going to mount a fucking
giant 50 foot dragon that's going to blast Fenris

356
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:11,590
and Hela with a blast of green hellfire just
disintegrating them. Fenris will be fine. Hela

357
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:17,570
leaps off of him so the wolf gets the brunt of the
blast. He has a healing factor, but Hela summons a

358
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:23,990
group of giant rock trolls from hell and their skin
are like immune to fire, right? And they just beat

359
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:31,930
the dragon to death and Neron with their rock clubs
and axes. Okay. Well, like Hela, Neron's going to

360
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:39,310
leap off the dragon before he's also attacked and
he's going to cause these iron chains like burning

361
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:45,490
with green flame to shoot up from the ground and
wrap around the rock trolls and Hela, pulling them

362
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:51,030
down into hell where they'll be trapped and
tormented for eternity. That's ending this

363
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:58,790
match. So Hela's in hell, Neron's hell. So what she
does then is she's going to summon the souls from

364
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:06,790
her hell into Neron's hell. And because the
Asgardians are all badasses with more strength

365
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:14,290
and fighting skill than Neron's weak ass souls,
Hela and her undead army kill all the souls in

366
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:20,590
Neron's hell and so he gets weakened and then
killed. I mean, I've got to have strength in

367
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:26,930
numbers, you'd think. Doesn't matter, even if
that's the case, as guardians are badass Vikings.

368
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:33,030
I mean, all the real badasses went to Valhalla
though. So Hela's squad is the JV team. It'll be

369
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:39,730
enough. It'll be enough. A great disagree. We'll
leave it there. Either the souls in Neron's hell

370
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:46,690
overpower the souls in Hela's hell or vice versa.
Let's go ahead and input the stats on these two

371
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:53,150
characters, run the simulations and come back
with a winner. AJ9K, hit it. Inputting data,

372
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:58,690
running calculations, processing results,
simulations complete. All right, I thought last

373
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:04,050
week was a good matchup. This matchup between
Neron and Hela, I think, is even better. These guys

374
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:10,390
are so close. Like, they're the same when it comes
to speed and invasiveness, damage level, range

375
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:16,470
and versatility, but they had enough differences
to make things interesting. Yeah, we said that

376
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:22,950
Neron is slightly more perceptive because he can
see a person's desires and that's what he exploits

377
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:27,410
in his bargains with them. Yeah, we also said that
makes him smarter because he's a little bit more

378
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:33,930
crafty and cunning in that regard. But we said that
Hela was not only a better fighter, but she was also

379
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:39,610
better physically in terms of durability and
strength because while Neron does have demon

380
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:46,250
physiology, the dude lost to Midnighter and when
he goes up against foes like Superman, his

381
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:51,350
strength is often bolstered through magic. Yeah,
so between the differences in their brains and

382
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:57,910
brawn, they were able to cancel each other out for a
truly even match. So taking all of these stats into

383
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:04,510
consideration, Joseph, who do you think is coming
out on top? Hela. You would. Well, Instagram

384
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:12,410
wouldn't. I'm guessing largely because you got
the poll up Hela late because Neron is beating Hela

385
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:18,710
65% to 35% in that poll, meaning more people think
that Neron's going to win. It's okay to be wrong

386
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:23,750
though. That's surprising. I did not see that
coming. I was pretty confident Hela was going to

387
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:30,250
get the popularity vote. Yeah, me too. Well, let's
find out who's correct. AG9K, the results please.

388
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:41,210
Here you are, sir. The winner of the matchup
between Neron and Hela is Hela. Oh yeah, baby. Me by

389
00:38:41,210 --> 00:38:51,290
51.4% or 514 of the 1000 matches compared to
Neron's 48.6%. Wow, that's almost a coin toss.

390
00:38:51,290 --> 00:38:56,850
That is a coin toss. Considering the way they
differed in stats, I'm surprised it came out to be

391
00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:01,610
this close. Well, like I said, they kind of evened
each other out when it came to brains and brawn.

392
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:08,450
Usually a win rate lower than 52.5% of the matches I
consider a coin toss where if you ran another 1000

393
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:12,790
simulations, you might get a different result
because it's just that close. But let's not do

394
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:20,090
that. I mean, we could. But let's not. Fine.
Congrats to Hela. Congrats to the Marvel fans.

395
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:25,870
We're on a streak now, guys. It's been a while. A
streak of two. That's not a streak. It's a streak,

396
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:30,350
baby. We're just going to keep it rolling. Keep it
rolling all the way into January. That does it for

397
00:39:30,350 --> 00:39:37,950
this dual episode. H.A .9K, help close this up.

our next episode, which is dropping days before

403
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:14,130
Halloween, we are going to bring you a special
spooky episode where we pit the House of Mystery

404
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:19,190
against the Crypt of Shadows. Yeah, this is a
special dual request. It's going to be a team duel

405
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:25,830
between seven supernatural and mystic users from
DC and Marvel. But we're going to tie in some like

406
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:30,590
tales of the crypt goodness in there. It'll be a lot
of fun. But that does it for this episode. We want to
