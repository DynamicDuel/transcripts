1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,994 --> 00:00:30,155
Welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:35,777
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:36,217 --> 00:00:42,719
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous
Joe. And in this episode, we are doing a duel

5
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:48,440
between the characters Dorothy Spinner from
The Doom Patrol and Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur.

6
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:54,106
This is the final duel in lead up to our big
team duel next episode. where we're gonna pit

7
00:00:54,146 --> 00:00:59,527
the teams of Doom Patrol and Guardians of the
Galaxy against each other. Yeah, Dorothy Spinner

8
00:00:59,687 --> 00:01:06,169
and Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur are both little
girl superheroes with big monsters as backup,

9
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:10,210
basically. It'll be a lot of fun to break down
these characters. Moon Girl has a fantastic

10
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:15,392
backstory that I was really glad to dive into,
so can't wait to talk all about her and figure

11
00:01:15,472 --> 00:01:19,753
out who the heck's gonna win this matchup later
on this episode. Before that, we're gonna break

12
00:01:19,773 --> 00:01:25,060
down the comic book movie news to come out in
the past week. of which there isn't much due

13
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,165
to the ongoing strikes. There was like a 45
second Loki season 2 teaser, so we're going

14
00:01:30,225 --> 00:01:35,290
to talk about that. Yeah and this episode is
actually sponsored by the Chronicle AI card

15
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:42,077
game that Jonathan and I invented. That's right,
we are sponsoring our own episode because we

16
00:01:42,097 --> 00:01:46,764
can. it's our podcast. So we're going to talk
a little bit about the card game that Jonathan

17
00:01:46,784 --> 00:01:50,886
and I made. As always, we list our segment times
in our episode description, so feel free to

00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:06,114
the artificial life form for running extensive
duels, just a rather very intelligent simulator

21
00:02:06,374 --> 00:02:14,826
9000, or Alfred Jarvis 9000. Here's a quick

00:03:31,017 --> 00:03:33,511
the Commando Movie. versus Robocop.

38
00:03:56,566 --> 00:04:01,349
A No Prize is an award Marvel used to give out
to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Dual No Prize,

39
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:05,911
is a digital award we post on Instagram and
in our email newsletter for the person that

40
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:11,335
we feel gave the best answer to our question
of the week. We got a lot of great answers

41
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:16,738
this time. I think a total of eight people called
in. Unfortunately, we can only pick four answers

42
00:04:16,938 --> 00:04:22,442
and there were only really four answers to give
because the question last week was... What

43
00:04:22,482 --> 00:04:27,645
was your favorite Marvel or DC cartoon from
the 90s and why? I think the answers will be

44
00:04:27,705 --> 00:04:33,228
pretty obvious, but it'll be interesting to
see which one comes out on top. Our first honorable

45
00:04:33,328 --> 00:04:38,070
mention goes to Dustin Balcom, who said, Hey,
dynamic duelist Dustin Balcom here and I am

46
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:45,054
jumping in right away to get my answer because
I'm not going to let these DC robots come out

47
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:51,310
and just say Batman the animated series because
it is good, but my gosh grow personality. The

48
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:57,254
real answer is the 90s Spider-Man cartoon because
it was just perfection. And that's all I got

49
00:04:57,274 --> 00:05:02,738
to say. That's right, Jonathan. Anyone who thinks
that Batman the Animated Series was the best

50
00:05:02,758 --> 00:05:08,362
cartoon of the 90s basically has no personality,
according to Dustin. And he's right. The best

51
00:05:08,402 --> 00:05:13,646
cartoon is actually Spider-Man, which was a
fantastic adaptation of the comic books. It

52
00:05:13,706 --> 00:05:17,248
introduced kids to a whole bunch of other Marvel
superheroes. There were a lot of crossovers

53
00:05:17,288 --> 00:05:22,700
in that show. Killer opening theme song. and
the show gave us the first example of the Spider-Verse.

54
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:30,225
I dunno, sounds kinda boring to me. What? Yeah.
I mean, big whoop. You know you watched that

55
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:36,269
shit. I did, it was good I guess. Travis Herndon
and Lizzie Dyer Arnie also gave the answer

56
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:43,194
of the 90's Spider-Man cartoon. But Colby Hentges
gave this answer. Hey boys, Colby Hentges.

57
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:47,937
I know these are usually opinion questions and
there's no right or wrong answer, but this

58
00:05:47,977 --> 00:05:53,135
week is different. If you don't pick Batman,
the animated series, you're wrong. It's still

59
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:58,236
some of the best telling of some of Batman's
best stories. Kevin Conroy is Batman. Mark

60
00:05:58,256 --> 00:06:03,578
Hamill is Joker. It's the best. B-Taz or bust.
Now, Joseph, I've got to ask you, would you

61
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:13,561
rather be boring or wrong? Uh, I'd rather be
wrong, I guess. That's fine. You rag about

62
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:17,784
everything, so it makes sense. I love how passionate
this week's answers are for this question.

63
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:23,488
How the DC guys have no personality and how
the Marvel guys are just wrong. But they are

64
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:29,512
because the Batman animated series is so good
with the music, with the voice work, even with

65
00:06:29,532 --> 00:06:35,217
the character adaptations. And so influential
in terms of what came after it for DC. You

66
00:06:35,237 --> 00:06:40,221
mean like the Superman show, Justice League?
Exactly. And even beyond that with the DC animated

67
00:06:40,261 --> 00:06:44,751
movie universe films. Yeah, the legacy of the
show is pretty lasting, I'll admit that. We

68
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:48,614
want to give a shout out to Ezra Garcia who
also gave the answer of Batman the Animated

69
00:06:48,654 --> 00:06:56,079
series. Our final honorable mention goes to
Scott Camacho who said, Johnny please do not

70
00:06:56,119 --> 00:07:01,463
change the color of my name. But when it comes
to this category, I'm going to have to side

71
00:07:01,483 --> 00:07:05,686
with Marvel, mainly the X-Men series.

72
00:07:11,286 --> 00:07:19,453
banger of a soundtrack you cannot get any more
than the X-Men. Come on! That's right! Even

73
00:07:19,553 --> 00:07:26,700
a DC fan can admit that the X-Men animated series
in the 90s was the best cartoon at that time.

74
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:32,725
Scotty mentioned the opening theme, which is
still the best theme in all of cartoons. His

75
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:38,446
brother, Gilly Macho, also gave the same answer
and made great points that... The show pretty

76
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:44,328
much defined the 90s as far as superheroes go
and it was highly influential in getting the

77
00:07:44,448 --> 00:07:50,131
X-Men movie made which in turn probably helped
kickstart the MCU. So you know the influence

78
00:07:50,311 --> 00:07:54,272
of the Batman animated series is one thing but
I think the influence of the X-Men animated

79
00:07:54,312 --> 00:07:59,734
series was even greater and you know it's coming
back on Disney Plus next year. I don't see

80
00:08:01,075 --> 00:08:05,477
Batman the animated series coming back. Well
they're trying to do it with Batman Kid Crusader.

81
00:08:06,057 --> 00:08:11,023
I don't know what that is. It's Bruce Timm's
new Batman cartoon. Come on, keep up. Why would

82
00:08:11,063 --> 00:08:18,226
I keep up with that? It's DC. Because DC's better.
Duh. Not according to Scotty. You know, I'm

83
00:08:18,246 --> 00:08:22,668
going to have to change him to Team Red on the
Discord from Team Blue. Scotty, let's strike

84
00:08:22,808 --> 00:08:28,290
one. Strike one, my friend. Thanks to everyone
for sending in your answer. But the winner

85
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:34,433
of this week's No Prize is Brandon Estegard,
who said, I barely make the cut off of a 90s

86
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:39,215
skit. I'm also going with a show that barely
makes a cut and that's Batman Beyond. I don't

87
00:08:39,235 --> 00:08:44,158
think there's a wrong answer to this question,
but what sets Batman above the rest is it doesn't

88
00:08:44,178 --> 00:08:49,260
have to rely on storylines from the comics and
can still establish amazing episodes. It was

89
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,583
a fresh and creative take on Batman with the
updated style from the OG animated series.

90
00:08:55,244 --> 00:09:00,346
Yes, Spider-Man, Batman the animated series,
the X-Men animated series were all great, but

91
00:09:00,366 --> 00:09:04,929
when you think of Batman Beyond, it was almost
like an amalgamation of everything that made

92
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:10,549
those other shows. Phenomenal I guess you could
say that because you know it had the cool animation

93
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:15,293
style from Batman the animated series as Brandon
mentioned But it also had you know the killer

94
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:20,057
soundtrack like the Marvel cartoons did and
more mature plots and adult themes and things

95
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:24,901
like that You know yeah, absolutely That was
a DC cartoon that I think even Marvel fans

96
00:09:24,921 --> 00:09:30,405
have to admit was insanely cool It was almost
like the Marvel version of Batman right the

97
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:36,470
fuck yeah, I'm just gonna put that out there
Well, I'm not agreeing with that Now, for as

98
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:44,193
good as Batman Beyond was, I think X-Men actually
was the clear winner for this question. However,

99
00:09:44,253 --> 00:09:48,855
Brandon was the only person to give the answer
Batman Beyond, and he got points for originality

100
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:53,497
with this one, since we don't usually like to
let people share No Prizes, you know? Right.

101
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:58,019
Congrats, Brandon! You win this week's No Prize.
If you, the listener, want a shot at winning

102
00:09:58,039 --> 00:10:02,741
your own No Prize, stay tuned to later on in
this episode when we'll be asking another Question

103
00:10:02,781 --> 00:10:06,146
of the Week. And now that that's done... Onto
the news!

104
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,751
Alright, there's not much news this past week
when it comes from Marvel and DC, but we did

105
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:23,473
get a teaser of sorts for the upcoming Loki
Season 2 on Disney+, which is strange because

106
00:10:23,493 --> 00:10:29,795
we already got a full-on trailer for the show,
so it's kind of weird to get a 45 second teaser

107
00:10:30,435 --> 00:10:35,237
after the trailer. Usually that's flipped around.
But we did get some pretty interesting new

108
00:10:35,257 --> 00:10:40,720
shots of what's going down. in Loki season 2
starting October 6th. Like we said with the

109
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:47,805
trailer, this all looks phenomenal. The cinematography
and the visual effects are movie level. In

110
00:10:47,845 --> 00:10:51,568
some cases, it looks even better than how the
movie looks, especially when it comes to the

111
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:56,411
set design and stuff. The teaser basically introduces
the concept that Loki is being pulled through

112
00:10:56,511 --> 00:11:03,664
space and time involuntarily. He meets up with
Sylvie. who appears is hiding out in like McDonald's

113
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:10,187
in the 1970s after the events of season one
where she killed He Who Remains and kickstarted

114
00:11:10,227 --> 00:11:14,490
the multiverse. She still has the really bad
haircut, but Loki and Sylvie join forces here,

115
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:19,272
going up against Victor Timely, who we get some
new shots of Jonathan Majors playing the character.

116
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:26,437
We also see Rhona Renslayer from season one,
who in the comics is King of the Conquerors'

117
00:11:26,757 --> 00:11:32,933
romantic interest. She appears to be in Victor
Timely's timeline, and she's holding this futuristic

118
00:11:33,013 --> 00:11:37,696
laser gun type device. Yeah, it makes me wonder
whose side she's on. Like, is she gonna try

119
00:11:37,716 --> 00:11:43,119
and stop Kang, or is she gonna try and stop
Loki? That's a great question. My inclination

120
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:48,683
is that she's on Kang's side, and she's probably
his only ally, especially since she was such

121
00:11:48,803 --> 00:11:54,667
a firm believer in the TVA and its mission,
even after she realized that the leaders of

122
00:11:54,687 --> 00:12:01,432
the TVA were just lifeless automatons. True,
yeah, true. I mean, for a teaser, it definitely

123
00:12:01,532 --> 00:12:05,294
teases. I don't know if I mentioned this in
our review of the latest trailer that came

124
00:12:05,354 --> 00:12:10,858
out, but Loki was my favorite thing to come
out of the post-Endgame era of the Marvel universe,

125
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,042
next to Shang-Chi. So I'm really looking forward
to this, really intrigued by the marketing

126
00:12:16,062 --> 00:12:20,425
that they're putting out for it, even if it's
just a 45-second teaser. Yeah, I'm also super

127
00:12:20,465 --> 00:12:23,867
excited. We have less than a month before this
show comes out, and perhaps we'll get another

128
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:28,962
full-length trailer before that time, but we'll
see. That does it for the news for this episode.

129
00:12:29,022 --> 00:12:34,665
Jonathan and I want to briefly remind listeners
that we created a card game for all you card

130
00:12:34,705 --> 00:12:40,127
gamers and tabletop gamers out there and board
gamers. Jonathan and I have a deck building

131
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:45,690
card game that we developed over the span of
10 years or so and we've been told that it's

132
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:51,372
really fun and we played it and we think it's
really fun. So if you guys are into that kind

133
00:12:51,392 --> 00:12:59,368
of stuff at all, check it at all. visit ChronicleAIgame.com,
which we will link in the show notes, and check

134
00:12:59,388 --> 00:13:03,751
out the card game. Jonathan and I put a lot
of work into it and would appreciate any and

135
00:13:03,771 --> 00:13:09,434
all support you guys can give in that capacity.
We do have a Marvel vs. DC version of this

136
00:13:09,474 --> 00:13:15,277
card game exclusive to patrons. So whether or
not you get the Chronicle AI version of the

137
00:13:15,297 --> 00:13:21,360
game, which is robot themed, or the Marvel vs.
DC version of the game, which we called Infinity

138
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,328
Crisis, let us know if you pick it up. and what
you think about it. We'd love for you to play

139
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:29,974
it. We think it's great, and we think you'll
think the same. Speaking of card games, that

140
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:31,676
brings us to our question of the week.

141
00:13:36,174 --> 00:13:43,617
So all the gamers out there, what is your favorite
non-video game, for Marvel or DC, and why?

142
00:13:43,737 --> 00:13:48,879
You know, such as board games, card games, tabletop
games, anything physical like that you've played.

143
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:53,801
Yeah, Jonathan and I are big fans of board games
and stuff like that, so largely this question

144
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:57,522
is to help inform me, I think, about some of
the things that are out there that I may not

145
00:13:57,542 --> 00:14:02,284
know about that I would love to check out. So

151
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,634
That does it for the news portion of this episode.
Now let's move on to the main event, where

152
00:14:34,694 --> 00:14:40,460
we find out who's gonna win in a match between
the Doom Patrol's Dorothy Spinner against Moon

153
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,881
Girl and Devil Dinosaur.

154
00:14:57,154 --> 00:15:01,418
Okay, Dorothy Spinner against Moon Girl and
Devil Dinosaur. Of course, you'll be familiar

155
00:15:01,438 --> 00:15:06,984
with Dorothy Spinner if you've seen any of the
HBO Max Doom Patrol series, or I guess it's

156
00:15:07,004 --> 00:15:12,330
just Max now. Phenomenal series. If you haven't
watched it, I definitely recommend it, especially

157
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:17,446
season two, the season that Dorothy Spinner
is featured in. Yeah, Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur

158
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:23,468
actually have their own show too on the Disney
Kids channel and on Disney Plus, which is actually

159
00:15:23,588 --> 00:15:29,689
incredible for a character that just came out
in 2016. I think to go from non-existence when

160
00:15:29,789 --> 00:15:35,511
this podcast started to having a full-on show
of their own is a real testament to how cool

161
00:15:35,551 --> 00:15:39,692
the characters of Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur
are. I highly recommend the cartoon. It is

162
00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:46,086
for kids, but it is highly inspired visually
by the Spider-Verse films. It's not... 3D animated,

163
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:51,211
it's 2D, but there's a lot of cool stuff in
there that's very comic book-y. That's cool.

164
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:56,676
Is it Moon Girl or Devil Dinosaur or both that
were created in 2016? Well, Devil Dinosaur

165
00:15:56,716 --> 00:16:03,221
dates back to the 1960s as a creation of Jack
Kirby. Moon Girl was created much more recently,

166
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:07,585
and I go into that a little bit in my history.
In addition to the shows, you know, also check

167
00:16:07,605 --> 00:16:11,869
out the comics. The Doom Patrol comics are very
highly recommended, especially the run by Grant

168
00:16:11,889 --> 00:16:16,300
Morrison. And I have to say, in my research
for this episode, I had a whole lot of fun

169
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,783
going back, reading the first two arcs for Moon
Girl and Devil Dinosaur. Nice, well, let's

170
00:16:20,803 --> 00:16:25,887
get into it. To explain the methodology behind
our duels, let's go to our sentient duel simulator,

171
00:16:26,167 --> 00:16:32,131
Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K, tell our listeners
how you go about determining a winner in our

172
00:16:32,171 --> 00:16:37,394
duel matchups. Yes, of course, sir. The way
I determine a winner between the contestants

173
00:16:37,435 --> 00:16:43,446
is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations using
the characters statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation

174
00:16:43,486 --> 00:16:49,207
is a probabilistic model used to determine outcomes
through random sampling. In this case, I randomise

175
00:16:49,227 --> 00:16:53,669
the statistics along a normal distribution as
a way to simulate the many variables that can

176
00:16:53,709 --> 00:16:58,570
occur during battle. The stat parameters are
based on the official Marvel power grid from

177
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,732
which the DC characters' statistics are extrapolated.
Additional stat categories are included such

178
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:09,273
as range, damage potential, versatility and
perception in order to create a more detailed

179
00:17:09,313 --> 00:17:14,407
and accurate simulation. The results of the
1000 simulations provide a percentage of wins

180
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:18,889
for each character. The contestant with the
higher percentage is declared the victor, as

181
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:24,271
they have a higher probability to win any given
battle. In an equitable pairing, neither character

182
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:28,993
should win 100% of the matches. The comic book
stories have shown that there's even a way

183
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:34,075
for Batman to defeat Superman, so the confidence
rate of my method falls in line with the precedents

184
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:39,137
that have been established in the source material.
My mathematical simulations are without subjectivity

185
00:17:39,197 --> 00:17:44,525
or bias. Feats are not the sole consideration,
nor are fan votes tabulated for determination

186
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:50,769
of the winner. Thanks AJ9K! Before we run the
simulations though, we like to break down each

187
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:55,892
character's histories and abilities before improvising
a scenario on how we imagine one of the 1000

188
00:17:56,233 --> 00:18:01,556
simulations would play out B for B. And I believe
it's my turn to go first with the DC character's

189
00:18:01,576 --> 00:18:06,920
backstory, so let me tell you all about Dorothy
Spinner. Her backstory is a little bit of a

190
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:13,312
downer, but here it is. Dorothy Spinner was
born with an ape-like facial disfiguration

191
00:18:13,712 --> 00:18:19,195
and hairy limbs, resulting in her birth mother
giving her up for adoption while Dorothy was

192
00:18:19,235 --> 00:18:25,538
still an infant. Adopted by the Spinner family,
Dorothy was raised as an only child on a farm

193
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:31,281
in rural Kansas. With many in the community
repulsed by Dorothy's appearance and due to

194
00:18:31,341 --> 00:18:36,844
excessive bullying from other children, the
Spinners isolated Dorothy on their farm, which

195
00:18:36,944 --> 00:18:42,895
occupied much of the Spinner's As a result of
her loneliness and isolation, Dorothy developed

196
00:18:42,975 --> 00:18:48,856
imaginary friends, which she was unknowingly
able to bring to life due to her psychic mind.

197
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:54,418
Her friends taught her to read and write and
told her stories, such as The Wizard of Oz,

198
00:18:54,618 --> 00:19:00,540
which Dorothy enjoyed. One day, while picking
flowers outside, Dorothy was accosted by a

199
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,120
young boy named Bernard

200
00:19:06,262 --> 00:19:11,545
When Dorothy made her way back to her barn to
find that Bernard had hung her cat, she wished

201
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:16,749
that Bernard was dead. It was at this point
that the Candlemaker emerged from her mind,

202
00:19:17,129 --> 00:19:23,353
a being capable of granting wishes. After making
the wish to the Candlemaker, Bernard was found

203
00:19:23,393 --> 00:19:28,797
in a field the next morning by his friends,
crucified and disemboweled. At the funeral,

204
00:19:29,157 --> 00:19:34,000
Dorothy vowed to never make another wish from
the Candlemaker again and buried him deep in

205
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,749
her mind. At age 11, Dorothy began being frightened
by the stories that her imaginary friends were

206
00:19:39,789 --> 00:19:45,193
telling her. Old, sinister fairy tales from
the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen.

207
00:19:45,573 --> 00:19:51,258
When three imaginary family members tried to
get Dorothy to wear red shoes, they reminded

208
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:55,922
Dorothy of a fairy tale about a girl who couldn't
stop dancing until her legs were chopped off.

209
00:19:56,302 --> 00:20:00,786
Dorothy told them that she had something to
show them behind the barn, at which point Dorothy

210
00:20:00,806 --> 00:20:06,462
shot and killed them with an imaginary gun.
A few years later, A battle between a team

211
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:12,447
of superhero outcasts known as the Doom Patrol
and the Lord of Chaos named Pytheia spilled

212
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:18,392
onto the Spinner farm. Home alone, Dorothy got
swept up into the battle and helped the superhero

213
00:20:18,432 --> 00:20:24,057
team defeat Pytheia when the others seemingly
died in the pandemonium. Dorothy was made an

214
00:20:24,137 --> 00:20:30,062
honorary member of the Doom Patrol and was shocked
when they called her their friend. After realizing

215
00:20:30,082 --> 00:20:35,506
that their daughter had psychic powers, the
Spinners called Dr. Niles Calder. aka the Chief,

216
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:40,627
who you can learn more about in our Chief vs.
Professor X duel episode. The Chief agreed

217
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:45,189
to help care for Dorothy and brought her to
the Doom Patrol's new headquarters, the Secret

218
00:20:45,249 --> 00:20:50,730
Sanctuary in Happy Harbor, Rhode Island, a former
base of the Justice League which contained

219
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:57,332
a vault of souvenirs from past Justice League
battles. One of those souvenirs was the Materiopticon,

220
00:20:57,712 --> 00:21:03,502
formerly wielded by the villain Dr. Destiny
and Dream of the Endless before him. the latter

221
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:09,223
of whom you can learn more about in our Sandman
vs. Mephisto duel episode. Due to the Materiopticon's

222
00:21:09,243 --> 00:21:15,345
ability to turn dreams into reality, Dorothy's
imaginary family, Damal, Darling Come Home,

223
00:21:15,405 --> 00:21:20,566
and Flying Robert, came back to life and attacked
Dorothy for killing them, still trying to get

224
00:21:20,606 --> 00:21:26,528
her to wear the red shoes. Realizing the red
shoes symbolized Dorothy's fear of menstruation,

225
00:21:26,968 --> 00:21:27,708
the Doom Patrol's

226
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:37,073
empowering the Materiopticon, which robbed the
imaginary beings of much of their strength.

227
00:21:37,353 --> 00:21:42,997
Before they vanished, Dorothy accepted the red
shoes and her own womanhood, realizing the

228
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:48,461
shoes were ruby slippers after all and that
she was at home with the Doom Patrol. When

229
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:52,984
the team relocated their headquarters onto Danny
the Street, who you can learn more about in

230
00:21:53,004 --> 00:21:59,408
our Danny the Street vs. Kerkoa episode, Dorothy
and new Doom Patrol member Flexmantello were

231
00:21:59,488 --> 00:22:05,919
kidnapped by an organization- known as the Men
from Nowhere, who imprisoned them in the sub-subbasement

232
00:22:05,939 --> 00:22:11,040
of the Pentagon known as the Ant Farm in order
to harness their psychic power to summon an

233
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,042
all-powerful entity known as the Telephone Avatar.
Although Flex Mantello managed to weaken the

234
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:22,423
Telephone Avatar by flexing a muscle that turned
the Pentagon into a circle, Flex and Dorothy

235
00:22:22,443 --> 00:22:26,845
would have been killed were it not for Dorothy
wishing for the Candlemaker to save her and

236
00:22:26,885 --> 00:22:32,442
her friends before passing out. When she awoke,
She saw the telephone avatar hanging from the

237
00:22:32,482 --> 00:22:37,985
ceiling. With the Candlemaker constantly intruding
into Dorothy's thoughts afterward, asking her

238
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:43,787
for wishes, Dorothy confessed to Joshua what
the Candlemaker had done before she collapsed

239
00:22:43,847 --> 00:22:49,029
from mental exhaustion. When Joshua went to
the Chief for help, the Chief shot and killed

240
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:55,392
Joshua for interrupting him. When Dorothy came
to and found Joshua dead, the Candlemaker emerged

241
00:22:55,452 --> 00:23:01,306
and asked Dorothy if she wished that Joshua
were alive. When she said that she did, the

242
00:23:01,326 --> 00:23:07,088
Candlemaker resurrected Joshua, only to kill
him immediately afterward, to Dorothy's horror.

243
00:23:07,548 --> 00:23:12,589
Having gained enough power from Dorothy's wishes
to emerge into the world fully formed, the

244
00:23:12,609 --> 00:23:18,011
Candlemaker decapitated the Chief and destroyed
Robotman's human brain before attacking the

245
00:23:18,051 --> 00:23:23,713
world's soul in New York City, causing people
to go insane. After learning that the Candlemaker

246
00:23:23,753 --> 00:23:29,060
was really an ancient malevolent entity, that
used Dorothy's psychic powers to emerge into

247
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,684
the physical plane, the Doom Patrol eventually
defeated Candlemaker, with Dorothy delivering

248
00:23:34,724 --> 00:23:40,749
the killing blow by blowing out the Candlemaker's
final flame. The Doom Patrol disbanded afterward,

249
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:46,674
forcing Dorothy to enter the real world and
get an apartment. Having to deal with continual

250
00:23:46,714 --> 00:23:51,958
harassment from onlookers whenever she had to
leave the house, Dorothy was also bombarded

251
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:58,246
by African spirits who kept asking her to join
their world. Dorothy created an imaginary version

252
00:23:58,266 --> 00:24:02,867
of the Doom Patrol to comfort her, though she
was encouraged by the scientist William Magnus,

253
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:07,869
who you can learn more about in our Metal Men
vs. Colossus duel episode, to overcome her

254
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:12,890
fear of the real world. After being attacked
by spirit-possessed mannequins at a shopping

255
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:18,292
mall, Dorothy was saved by Robot Man, who you
can learn more about in our Robot Man vs. Think

256
00:24:18,372 --> 00:24:23,713
episode. The two of them helped reform the Doom
Patrol, though Dorothy found herself depressed,

257
00:24:23,733 --> 00:24:29,427
and due to her inexperience and frequent inability
to contribute to the team as much as she wanted.

258
00:24:29,887 --> 00:24:35,249
After befriending a magical doll named Charlie,
who she later learned was possessed by the

259
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:41,650
spirit of a rabbi, Dorothy helped Charlie reform
the Holy Grail with the power of her imagination,

260
00:24:42,091 --> 00:24:47,992
and Charlie's spirit departed, his mission completed.
Alone again, Dorothy was taken on a camping

261
00:24:48,052 --> 00:24:53,974
trip by robot man and fellow Doom Patrol member
named Coagula. to let her know that her adoptive

262
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:58,977
father had died in a wheat-thresher accident
and that they found her biological mother,

263
00:24:59,337 --> 00:25:04,681
who was going to meet them soon. Upon realizing
that she was being asked to leave the Doom

264
00:25:04,701 --> 00:25:10,224
Patrol in order to live a normal life with her
mom, Dorothy unleashed a psychic explosion

265
00:25:10,364 --> 00:25:16,727
in a fit of immense rejection that killed Quagula,
destroyed Robotman, and put herself into a

266
00:25:16,788 --> 00:25:23,615
coma. After a new Doom Patrol team formed, Its
version of Robotman eventually realized that

267
00:25:23,655 --> 00:25:30,658
he was an imaginary version created by Dorothy
in her vegetative state. When the real, newly

268
00:25:30,698 --> 00:25:36,760
assembled Robotman realized what was going on,
he visited Dorothy in the hospital and made

269
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:42,763
the traumatic decision to take her off of life
support, and Dorothy soon died. And she remains

270
00:25:42,803 --> 00:25:48,605
dead in post-Flashpoint continuity, though Robotman
keeps a photo of the two of them and visits

271
00:25:48,625 --> 00:25:55,589
her grave every week. Powers-wise, Dorothy is
a powerful yet somewhat unstable psychic, capable

272
00:25:55,629 --> 00:26:02,052
of bringing her imaginary friends to life, sometimes
unwillingly. As a young girl, many of her imaginary

273
00:26:02,092 --> 00:26:07,996
friends manifest as symbols of her emotions,
often fear or as character interpretations

274
00:26:08,016 --> 00:26:14,580
from stories she's read or heard, and occasionally
as recreations of people she knows. This includes

275
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:20,195
but is not limited to... Pretty Miss Dot? who
has lipsticks for fingers that can shoot fire,

276
00:26:20,696 --> 00:26:27,381
paddle the sky, a swirling mass of hands holding
paddles, hearts of ice, a woman made of ice

277
00:26:27,401 --> 00:26:33,286
that can freeze things, dark as the morning,
a shadow creature with a giant fanged mouth,

278
00:26:33,806 --> 00:26:41,232
cowboy doll book face, a gun wielding cowboy
made of dolls with a book for a face, and Spinner,

279
00:26:41,653 --> 00:26:47,417
a superhero adult version of Dorothy, who's
a member of the imagined team, the Doom Force.

280
00:26:47,762 --> 00:26:53,604
and can manifest the nightmares of her opponents.
That's Dorothy Spinner. That was a lot darker

281
00:26:53,664 --> 00:26:58,286
than I thought it was going to be and very much
a downer. It is like the exact opposite of

282
00:26:58,346 --> 00:27:03,828
the Moongirl Devil Dinosaur backstory, which
is largely pretty fun and cute and yeah, not

283
00:27:03,868 --> 00:27:08,910
at all what Dorothy Spinner's story is. Yeah,
it's probably like the most depressing backstory

284
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:14,452
of any DC character I've ever done a bio for
in the span of this podcast. So let's cheer

285
00:27:14,493 --> 00:27:19,130
up everyone with Moongirl's backstory. Yeah,
I'm glad I'm going second here. Here's the

286
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:24,293
backstory for Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur.
In prehistoric times, in an alternate dimension

287
00:27:24,673 --> 00:27:30,176
existed Dinosaur World, a planet where dinosaurs
lived alongside the Neanderthal tribes of early

288
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:36,358
humans. Within a region of active volcanoes
called the Valley of Flame, the most aggressive

289
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:42,701
hominid tribe called the Killer Folk dominated
other less hostile tribes such as the Small

290
00:27:42,741 --> 00:27:48,278
Folk. When a group of Killer Folk came across
a female Tyrannosaurus rex-like dinosaur and

291
00:27:48,338 --> 00:27:53,523
her young, they attacked and killed the mother
and two of her children. They offered the third

292
00:27:53,563 --> 00:27:58,547
young dinosaur as a sacrifice to their volcano
god by burning it alive with the fire from

293
00:27:58,568 --> 00:28:04,473
their torches. The beast nearly died, but was
rescued by a boy from the Small Folk tribe

294
00:28:04,793 --> 00:28:10,422
who witnessed the massacre. The Neanderthal
child's name was Moonboy. as he was the only

295
00:28:10,462 --> 00:28:15,025
member of his tribe who was brave enough to
go out at night. He saw that the flames had

296
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:20,629
turned the dinosaur's scales a fiery red, and
the boy took care of it, naming him Devil.

297
00:28:21,089 --> 00:28:25,832
Moonboy and Devil Dinosaur formed a close bond,
and together they fought and defeated the Killer

298
00:28:25,852 --> 00:28:30,455
Folk tribe, claiming the Valley of Flame for
the small folk and protecting the lands from

299
00:28:30,555 --> 00:28:37,894
other dinosaurs and monsters. Meanwhile, universes
away, An autistic 9-year-old girl named Lunela

300
00:28:37,954 --> 00:28:43,616
Lafayette grew up on the Lower East Side of
Manhattan. Brilliant but shy and mocked for

301
00:28:43,636 --> 00:28:49,397
her awkwardness, Lunela acquired the nickname
Moon Girl due to her constant daydreaming about

302
00:28:49,437 --> 00:28:55,099
strange gadgets and inventions. When the inhuman
hero Black Bolt released the Terranian mists

303
00:28:55,219 --> 00:29:00,921
into Earth's atmosphere during a battle with
Thanos, Lunela believed she could use her intelligence

304
00:29:00,961 --> 00:29:08,151
to help contain the gases. were afraid that
pterogene exposure would transform them as

305
00:29:08,171 --> 00:29:13,133
the substance was used by the inhuman race as
a catalyst to change them into their superpowered

306
00:29:13,213 --> 00:29:18,535
forms. Inhumans were descendants of a group
of early mankind that were experimented on

307
00:29:18,595 --> 00:29:24,138
by the alien race, the Kree, to serve as their
soldiers. Hundreds, if not thousands of people

308
00:29:24,198 --> 00:29:29,960
on Earth unknowingly had inhuman genetics and
were being altered due to the pterogene clouds

309
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:36,115
now in the air. You can learn more about pterogenesis
the Inhumans and their King Black Bolt in our

310
00:29:36,155 --> 00:29:42,417
Shazam vs Black Bolt dual episode. Lunela believed
the solution to the Terran clouds lay in alien

311
00:29:42,457 --> 00:29:48,380
Kree science, so she built a device to help
her locate any Kree technology on Earth in

312
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,242
order to study it. This led her underneath the
Brooklyn Bridge where she found a Kree device

313
00:29:53,282 --> 00:29:59,124
called an Omni-Wave Projector that was capable
of opening portals between time and space.

314
00:29:59,705 --> 00:30:06,024
Meanwhile, universes away, Moon Boy happened
upon another Omni-Wave projector that had landed

315
00:30:06,084 --> 00:30:10,928
on Dinosaur World that was being worshipped
by the Killer Folk tribe, who called it their

316
00:30:11,028 --> 00:30:16,552
Night Stone. The Killer Folk caught Moon Boy
with the device and beat him to death, when

317
00:30:16,612 --> 00:30:22,776
suddenly both projectors activated simultaneously,
opening a portal between Earth and Dinosaur

318
00:30:22,816 --> 00:30:27,939
World. A group of Killer Folk entered the portal
and began terrorizing the people of present-day

319
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:34,143
Manhattan, but they were followed by Devil Dinosaur,
who sought to avenge Moonboy's death. Devil

320
00:30:34,183 --> 00:30:39,266
Dinosaur saved Lunela from the Killer Folk,
who had fled their encounter, and she explained

321
00:30:39,306 --> 00:30:44,128
to the semi-intelligent beast that she needed
his help to get the Omni-Wave Projector from

322
00:30:44,168 --> 00:30:49,131
the Neanderthals in order to save humanity.
Before they could act, however, Devil Dinosaur

323
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:55,234
was captured and imprisoned in a secret facility.
Finding her courage, Lunela resolved to rescue

324
00:30:55,274 --> 00:31:02,666
her friend and equipped a series of homemade
gadgets and a suit After hacking into a government

325
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:07,109
database to find the dinosaur's whereabouts,
she snuck away from home and broke into the

326
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:12,633
secret facility, using her gadgets to break
Devil from his high-tech cage. Together, the

327
00:31:12,653 --> 00:31:18,057
duo tracked the Killer Folk to a Manhattan rooftop
where they defeated the Neanderthal group and

328
00:31:18,117 --> 00:31:23,501
recovered the Omni-Wave Projector. However,
immediately after their victory, the Terran

329
00:31:23,521 --> 00:31:29,885
Cloud descended upon Lunella, causing her to
undergo teragenesis and encasing her in a giant

330
00:31:30,065 --> 00:31:35,649
egg. Devil Dinosaur carried the egg containing
Lunela to safety at her secret lab underneath

331
00:31:35,689 --> 00:31:40,813
her elementary school. When she hatched, Lunela
could not immediately tell what the Terrigen

332
00:31:40,853 --> 00:31:46,397
had changed about her. However, later at school,
she discovered that she would involuntarily

333
00:31:46,517 --> 00:31:51,060
switch minds with Devil Dinosaur, who was back
at the lab, whenever she experienced strong

334
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:56,764
emotions such as anger or hunger, and spontaneously
during a full moon. Keeping her crime fighting

335
00:31:56,804 --> 00:32:01,743
a secret from her parents as much as possible,
Lunella was eventually discovered by scientist

336
00:32:01,863 --> 00:32:08,425
Amadeus Cho, who administered a test developed
by Bruce Banner called the Brain Omnicompetence

337
00:32:08,585 --> 00:32:13,448
Examiner. It was determined that Lunella was
probably the most intelligent mind on Earth,

338
00:32:13,888 --> 00:32:19,390
scoring higher than other scientific minds such
as Mr. Fantastic. The villain Dr. Doom took

339
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:24,832
offense to this news and attacked Lunella, but
with help from the superhuman community, including

340
00:32:24,892 --> 00:32:30,634
Dr. Strange, the X-Men, and Ironheart, She and
Devil Dinosaur were able to defeat the Doombot

341
00:32:30,754 --> 00:32:37,056
army. At one point, the inhuman hero Ms. Marvel
recruited Lunella and Devil Dinosaur to help

342
00:32:37,156 --> 00:32:41,938
in the war between the Inhumans and the X-Men,
which was caused by the toxic nature of the

343
00:32:41,998 --> 00:32:47,279
Terrigan mists to mutants. Lunella used her
knowledge of Kree technology to help the X-Men

344
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:52,901
scientist Forge miniaturize a version of a machine
he designed that would compress the Terrigan

345
00:32:52,941 --> 00:32:58,466
gases into a solid state and incinerate it.
You can learn more about Forge in our Mr. Terrific

346
00:32:58,506 --> 00:33:04,988
vs. Forge dual episode. Later, Lunella received
a distress call from space and built a spacecraft

347
00:33:05,088 --> 00:33:10,410
so she and Devil Dinosaur could answer it. During
the adventure, her omni-wave projector malfunctioned

348
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:16,752
and the pair ended up back in time on Dinosaur
World, Devil's home planet. There they found

349
00:33:16,852 --> 00:33:21,533
Moonboy at the time he discovered the omni-wave
projector and they were able to prevent him

350
00:33:21,673 --> 00:33:26,815
from being beaten by the Killer Folk. Knowing
that Devil was back home with his true owner,

351
00:33:27,095 --> 00:33:32,377
Lunella decided that leaving him with Moonboy
was the right thing to do. She said goodbye,

352
00:33:32,577 --> 00:33:37,719
and though Devil Dinosaur protested, she tearfully
told him she didn't want him anymore and used

353
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:42,881
the projector to travel back to Earth alone.
Sad and isolated, Lunella ended up joining

354
00:33:42,921 --> 00:33:48,464
the Thing, Human Torch, and the robot Herbie
in a new version of the Fantastic Four, as

355
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:53,466
Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman were off with
their children recreating the multiverse. You

356
00:33:53,486 --> 00:33:58,568
can learn more about that in our Justice Society
vs. Fantastic Four dual episode. Eventually,

357
00:33:58,628 --> 00:34:03,870
Lunella used Herbie to open a dimensional portal
to bring Devil Dinosaur back to Earth to help

358
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:09,092
in a fight against the Super Skrull, and the
two were reunited. Lunella admitted she was

359
00:34:09,152 --> 00:34:13,954
wrong for leaving Kim, Devil forgave her, and
the two went back to fighting crime on their

360
00:34:14,074 --> 00:34:19,797
own. This included helping Doctor Strange rescue
a boy kidnapped by the villain Nightmare, assisting

361
00:34:19,877 --> 00:34:25,759
Spider-Man against a Goblin foe, and solving
an unsolvable riddle for Thor that was posed

362
00:34:25,819 --> 00:34:31,380
by his brother Loki. The latter adventure revealing
that Devil was worthy of wielding Mjolnir and

363
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:36,002
it transformed him into the Thunder Lizard.
On a family trip to the country of Wakanda,

364
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:41,703
Lunela's parents discovered her secret alter
ego as Moon Girl. They banned her from continuing

365
00:34:41,743 --> 00:34:47,085
to fight crime with her dinosaur pet, though
they later compromised as long as Lunela visited

366
00:34:47,145 --> 00:34:52,335
with a therapist once a week. At that time,
she formed a support group for fellow newly

367
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:58,077
powered adolescent inhumans called the Support
Alliance Derby for Sensationally Abled Kids,

368
00:34:58,657 --> 00:35:05,700
or SADSACS for short. And that's her backstory.
Powers-wise, Moon Girl has the inhuman power

369
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:11,123
to temporarily swap her consciousness with Devil
Dinosaur, her crime-fighting partner. This

370
00:35:11,163 --> 00:35:15,805
process is triggered involuntarily, caused by
heightened emotional states and the Fool Moon.

371
00:35:16,205 --> 00:35:20,967
She has an exceptionally high intellect. stated
to likely be the smartest person on Earth,

372
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:26,349
and has built a vast array of homemade gadgets
for her crime fighting activities. This includes,

373
00:35:26,409 --> 00:35:32,331
but is not limited to, spectrum scanning goggles,
spring loaded boxing gloves, rocket powered

374
00:35:32,371 --> 00:35:38,914
roller skates, a helicopter backpack, a plunger
tipped taser gun, sneeze powder grenades, a

375
00:35:38,954 --> 00:35:44,456
flashlight flash bang, and so many other toys
in her utility belt. She can invent nearly

376
00:35:44,636 --> 00:35:50,034
anything she puts her gifted mind to, physically
through engineering, or digitally through computer

377
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:55,477
programming. Devil Dinosaur is a physically
and mentally enhanced Tyrannosaurus Rex-like

378
00:35:55,558 --> 00:36:01,801
dinosaur via genetic mutation awakened when
he was set aflame as a youngling. He has increased

379
00:36:01,841 --> 00:36:07,784
durability and strength, able to lift around
25 tons, and his scaly hide is immune to heat

380
00:36:07,924 --> 00:36:14,108
and strong enough to be bulletproof. Devil Dinosaur's
fangs, claws, and his sense of smell are razor

381
00:36:14,128 --> 00:36:19,690
sharp, and he can track nearly anyone by their
scent. He has human level reasoning abilities

382
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:24,832
and can fully understand moon girl's commands.
That's moon girl in devil dinosaur. Wait, so

383
00:36:25,033 --> 00:36:30,695
when devil dinosaur takes over moon girl's body,
is she just like this snarling creature who's

384
00:36:30,715 --> 00:36:35,677
like always hungry? Yeah, she looks quite feral
actually. It's kind of funny when it happens.

385
00:36:36,957 --> 00:36:41,459
Interesting. And her friends are aware of what's
going on or they aren't? No, she just gets

386
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:46,641
further ostracized for being weird when she
swaps minds with devil dinosaur during school

387
00:36:46,681 --> 00:36:52,061
time. That's funny. That's cute. What a cute
character. Yeah, and she freaking lives at

388
00:36:52,081 --> 00:36:57,364
the end. Yeah, that's because Marvel is for
little kids, bro. OK. All right. DC is for

389
00:36:57,384 --> 00:37:03,809
the adults. Sad adults, but adults nonetheless.
I mean, what adult isn't sad?

390
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:15,830
So now that we got the characters' histories
and abilities out of the way, let's speculate

391
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:20,812
on how one of the 1000 simulated matches will
go. The winner is determined by simulations,

392
00:37:21,232 --> 00:37:25,513
not the speculation, but it's fun to imagine
how the fight could play out. Alfred Jarvis

393
00:37:25,533 --> 00:37:31,215
9000, what are the rules of our speculation?
Well, I should say there are no rules, other

394
00:37:31,255 --> 00:37:35,296
than the characters have no prior knowledge
of the other going into the fight. All they

395
00:37:35,316 --> 00:37:39,857
are aware of starting out is that the other
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.

396
00:37:40,237 --> 00:37:45,555
For the speculation... contestants will begin
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript

397
00:37:45,615 --> 00:37:50,397
environment that will have no bearing on the
match itself as no environmental statistics

398
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:55,759
are considered in my simulations. The contestants
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright

399
00:37:55,779 --> 00:38:00,641
then let's get into it! Dorothy Spinner and
Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur meet on the battlefield.

400
00:38:01,061 --> 00:38:06,664
Who goes first? Honestly this is kind of hard
because I don't think either character would

401
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:13,219
attack the other really like they'd probably
commiserate and want to be but that's too bad

402
00:38:13,239 --> 00:38:18,502
because the purpose of the podcast is to see
who would win in no holds barred action. So

403
00:38:18,522 --> 00:38:25,446
we're gonna make these children fight, damn
it. All right, I figured that once Dorothy

404
00:38:25,546 --> 00:38:32,550
sees Devil Dinosaur, she's gonna freak out and
probably summon Pretty Miss Dot, who's kind

405
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:39,894
of her go-to when she's in danger. So this weird
entity wearing a helmet with lips. and curlers

406
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:45,778
and lipstick fingers flies toward Devil Dinosaur
and begins blasting him with fire. Alright,

407
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:51,843
well that does nothing. Devil Dinosaur is immune
to fire, so all this attack is gonna do is

408
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:56,786
just piss him off. So he's infuriated and he's
gonna roar real loud and then he's just gonna

409
00:38:56,826 --> 00:39:03,030
chomp down on Pretty Mistat with his razor sharp
teeth. Meanwhile, Moon Girl is gonna roller

410
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:07,613
skate over to Dorothy and just knock her the
hell out with a spring-loaded boxing glove.

411
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:13,135
Yeah, except that now Dorothy is emotionally
traumatized by having seen Pretty Miss Dot

412
00:39:13,195 --> 00:39:19,377
just die like that. So while Moon Girl was approaching
Dorothy, she's going to conjure several more

413
00:39:19,477 --> 00:39:25,939
entities. And we'll go with Paddle the Sky for
Moon Girl and Heart of Ice for Devil Dinosaur,

414
00:39:25,999 --> 00:39:30,920
since Fire didn't do anything to him. So not
only does Moon Girl's boxing glove get knocked

415
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:36,842
out of the way, she also gets paddled numerous
times by Paddle the Sky. And Devil Dinosaur

416
00:39:36,862 --> 00:39:43,003
is now encased in ice. Remind, what do Paddle
of the Sky and Heart of Ice look like? Paddle

417
00:39:43,023 --> 00:39:48,625
of the Sky is literally a spinning vortex of
hands holding wooden paddles. And Heart of

418
00:39:48,705 --> 00:39:55,427
Ice is just a woman made of ice. Okay. Uh, not
gonna lie, I don't think Moon Girl would be

419
00:39:55,487 --> 00:40:02,289
well equipped for all this weirdness. But she's
gonna evade the paddles by activating her spring-loaded

420
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:07,746
roller skates to launch herself into the air.
And then she's going to switch on her helicopter

421
00:40:07,786 --> 00:40:13,528
backpack. So she's flying through the air. And
as this paddle creature is chasing her, Moon

422
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:19,169
Girl is going to pilot over toward Devil Dinosaur.
And then she's going to quickly zip out of

423
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:26,251
the way so that paddle guy crashes into Devil
Dinosaur, who's in the ice. And basically,

424
00:40:26,311 --> 00:40:33,073
the paddles are going to break Devil Dinosaur
out of his ice casing. So now that Devil Dinosaur

425
00:40:33,093 --> 00:40:38,923
is free. He's just gonna tackle paddle the sky
out of the sky and just eviscerate it turning

426
00:40:38,963 --> 00:40:45,545
those paddles into Splinters I hope you choke
on them And while that's happening moon girl

427
00:40:45,565 --> 00:40:52,427
is gonna whip out a hairdryer That she outfitted
as a flamethrower and she's just gonna melt

428
00:40:52,507 --> 00:40:59,629
the ice lady to a puddle Dude keep killing Dorothy's
imaginary friends. See what happens. She's

429
00:40:59,669 --> 00:41:06,610
got some weird ass friends, you know Even you've
got insoles for her. Wow, wow, she can't catch

430
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:12,092
a break, can she? Dude, these friends are objectively
weird. I don't think anybody would deny them.

431
00:41:12,172 --> 00:41:18,834
Literally one of them is made out of paddles.
Come on. And while Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur

432
00:41:18,854 --> 00:41:24,355
are taking care of them, Dorothy's gonna be
like, oh no, my friends. And that is when Moon

433
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:29,677
Girl, she's gonna pull out a can of soda that
she shakes and then hurls over to Dorothy like

434
00:41:29,717 --> 00:41:35,828
a grenade and the can. is going to explode and
just drench Dorothy in this sticky adhesive

435
00:41:36,229 --> 00:41:41,212
that Moon Girl invented. Okay, the can, it's
going to explode way before it reaches Dorothy

436
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:46,876
because Cowboy doll Bookface is going to shoot
it right out of the sky when it's right over

437
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:53,381
Devil Dinosaur just drenching him in the adhesive
instead. So Devil is stuck to the ground and

438
00:41:53,461 --> 00:41:58,024
Cowboy is just going to keep shooting at Moon
Girl. All right, well, Moon Girl is going to

439
00:41:58,164 --> 00:42:05,809
dive behind Devil Dinosaur. and use him as cover
since she knows that he's bulletproof. And

440
00:42:05,849 --> 00:42:10,511
then to get him free of the adhesive, she's
gonna pour a soda can of anti-adhesive on him

441
00:42:11,152 --> 00:42:17,816
and then hop on Devil's back as he gets up and
just straight up charges Cowboy Dollface and

442
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:23,619
whips his tail right through him, book face.
Whatever. But his tail whip is gonna cause

443
00:42:23,939 --> 00:42:29,627
the Cowboy to explode into a thousand doll parts.
So he's gone. And without missing a beat, like

444
00:42:29,827 --> 00:42:35,052
after that tailwhip, Moon Girl is going to spring
off of Devil Dinosaur's back and she's going

445
00:42:35,072 --> 00:42:40,516
to shoot a taser plunger at Dorothy that sticks
to Dorothy's head and it's going to send like

446
00:42:40,556 --> 00:42:46,061
10,000 volts of electricity through her brain.
Just shutting it down. Well, OK, Dorothy's

447
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:51,486
knocked out, but she doesn't need to be conscious
for her imaginary friends to manifest or protect

448
00:42:51,526 --> 00:42:59,548
her. You know, so as Moon Girl is about to land.
She lands on Honey Pie, which is a beehive

449
00:42:59,568 --> 00:43:05,533
with tree branches for limbs and a honeypot
for a head. So Honey Pie has Moon Girl in this

450
00:43:05,793 --> 00:43:10,957
bear hug, essentially, and Moon Girl's being
squeezed and stung as she's pressed up against

451
00:43:10,997 --> 00:43:17,762
this pissed off beehive. And meanwhile, Spinner,
the adult version of Dorothy, is going to appear

452
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:25,203
and manifest Devil Dinosaur's greatest fear,
which is... I don't know, an army of the killer

453
00:43:25,243 --> 00:43:31,106
folk tribesmen who are all gonna rush and attack
Devil Dinosaur. I mean, Devil Dinosaur eats

454
00:43:31,146 --> 00:43:36,909
killer folk for breakfast, alright? So he's
gonna tear through them to rescue Moon Girl

455
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:43,493
from this beehive guy. Honey pie. Yeah, yeah,
he's gonna grab honey pie in his T-Rex claws

456
00:43:43,853 --> 00:43:49,176
and just freaking body slam that thing causing
it to drop Moon Girl who's gonna helicopter

457
00:43:49,216 --> 00:43:54,091
away to safety. And as she's flying away...
She's gonna pull out of her backpack a version

458
00:43:54,171 --> 00:44:00,256
of Professor X's Cerebro device that in the
comics she once calibrated to detect magic

459
00:44:00,296 --> 00:44:06,181
beings. So she's gonna be recalibrating it again.
Where is she pulling this stuff out from? Her

460
00:44:06,201 --> 00:44:12,006
backpack? Okay. Well, I mean, Spinner is still
around. So she's gonna appear into Moon Girl's

461
00:44:12,046 --> 00:44:18,092
mind and manifest Moon Girl's greatest fear,
which is, I don't know, what's Moon Girl's

462
00:44:18,112 --> 00:44:27,524
greatest fear? Uh, I... I don't know, an F on
a test or something? Big whoop. Moon Girl wearing

463
00:44:27,664 --> 00:44:34,269
the recalibrated Cerebro is gonna deduce that
Dorothy's friends are psychic manifestations.

464
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:41,456
So she's gonna pull out a bullhorn that emanates
a frequency that disrupts psychic energies.

465
00:44:42,116 --> 00:44:48,161
And Moon Girl's gonna use this invention to
just dissipate Spinner. Okay, all right, so.

466
00:44:48,834 --> 00:44:56,620
Dorothy is going to wake up to see Spinner dissipate.
And all of a sudden, she hears the Candlemaker

467
00:44:56,700 --> 00:45:01,444
whispering in her mind, asking her to make a
wish. And she's going to wish that this match

468
00:45:01,464 --> 00:45:08,550
was over. And that's what's going to happen.
Devil Dinosaur, he'll eat Moon Girl. And he

469
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:14,695
himself is going to burst into eldritch flames
that just melt his bodily tissue like Raiders

470
00:45:14,735 --> 00:45:20,414
of the Lost Ark style, just leaving this dinosaur
skeleton. Match over. What? I don't get it.

471
00:45:20,834 --> 00:45:25,135
Was Devil Dinosaur possessed or something? I
don't even know what happened there. No, like

472
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:30,857
he was more like driven insane by the Candlemaker.
And it caused him to eat Moon Girl? Yep. I

473
00:45:30,937 --> 00:45:36,519
say that like even before Dorothy hears the
Candlemaker like whispering in her ear and

474
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:41,640
then, you know, she makes the wish and all that
weirdness happens, that would take a while.

475
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:46,981
So before that, Devil Dinosaur just straight
up stomps Dorothy with his big old dinosaur

476
00:45:47,001 --> 00:45:53,631
foot. planning and then he's gonna let out a
big victory roar like the T-Rex did at the

477
00:45:53,671 --> 00:45:58,993
end of the Jurassic Park movie. I don't think
that hearing make a wish and then making a

478
00:45:59,033 --> 00:46:05,294
wish would take all that long. I mean it's not
quicker than a foot dropping on you so I don't

479
00:46:05,314 --> 00:46:10,636
know but we could go ahead and leave the match
there either Dorothy makes her wish and the

480
00:46:10,676 --> 00:46:16,554
candle maker causes moon girl and devil dinosaur
to destroy themselves or Dorothy doesn't have

481
00:46:16,574 --> 00:46:20,455
a chance to make the wish because she's a pancake.
Let's go ahead and find out which of these

482
00:46:20,475 --> 00:46:25,796
scenarios happens by inputting the stats for
these characters and running 1000 simulations.

483
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:31,898
We'll be right back with the winner. Hey G9K,
hit it! Inputting data. Running calculations.

484
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:37,540
Processing results. Simulations complete. I
hate to see these two characters go up against

485
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:41,361
each other. It would have been more fun, I think,
to do a speculation where they become best

486
00:46:41,401 --> 00:46:46,231
friends and hang out together, you know? Right?
It was kind of interesting just coming up with

487
00:46:46,251 --> 00:46:50,353
the stats. We kind of realized that both of
these characters' powers are essentially the

488
00:46:50,393 --> 00:46:55,776
power of imagination. Like they're highly, highly
versatile. Right, because Moon Girl can basically

489
00:46:55,996 --> 00:47:01,179
engineer anything she imagines, and Dorothy
Spinner can manifest it. So that was pretty

490
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:07,202
cool. We treated this matchup like a two versus
two character matchup, like a mini team duel,

491
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:12,004
which we've done before in episodes like Cloak
and Dagger versus the Wonder Twins, or North

492
00:47:12,024 --> 00:47:16,378
Star and Aurora versus Hawk and Dove. Yeah,
or like Daughters of the Demon versus Daughters

493
00:47:16,398 --> 00:47:23,240
of the Dragon. Yeah, we've done a few 2v2 matches
before. In this case, we counted the individual

494
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:30,102
stats for Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur, as well
as Dorothy Spinner on her own, and kind of

495
00:47:30,242 --> 00:47:37,644
an amalgamation of her imaginary friends, wherein
we averaged the stats of all of her imaginary

496
00:47:37,684 --> 00:47:41,845
friends and treated it as kind of like this
composite being. Yeah, which was not easy.

497
00:47:42,462 --> 00:47:46,483
No, it was pretty difficult to come up with
that average for the imaginary friends, but

498
00:47:46,523 --> 00:47:51,184
in the end we ended up getting win rates for
each one of the characters. Dorothy Spinner

499
00:47:51,204 --> 00:47:57,286
was by far the weakest. Yes, Dorothy Spinner
is hands down the weakest character I've ever

500
00:47:57,326 --> 00:48:03,047
done a duel with. I felt bad for her as I was
entering these stats in. But, her imaginary

501
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:08,389
friend creatures were actually really powerful,
more powerful than either Moon Girl or Devil

502
00:48:08,409 --> 00:48:13,239
Dinosaur on their own. And- kind of wiped the
floor with both of them individually, winning

503
00:48:13,379 --> 00:48:17,962
three quarters of all of its matches. And what
was really interesting was that Moon Girl actually

504
00:48:18,002 --> 00:48:23,405
had better stats than Devil Dinosaur. Right.
Just due to her heightened intelligence and

505
00:48:23,425 --> 00:48:27,948
versatility with all the inventions and stuff
like that. Devil Dinosaur is strong and can

506
00:48:27,968 --> 00:48:33,110
do damage, but otherwise, you know, he's not
that impressive statistically, considering

507
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:39,910
he's kind of a one trick pony and not that bright.
He's a dinosaur. It's kind of interesting because

508
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:44,412
a lot of Dorothy's imaginary friends were also
one trick ponies. But then you have someone

509
00:48:44,432 --> 00:48:48,874
like the candle maker who isn't technically
an imaginary friend, but we still kind of counted

510
00:48:48,914 --> 00:48:54,476
him in the composite considering the fact that
he was a manifestation from Dorothy's mind.

511
00:48:54,916 --> 00:49:00,039
And the guy could almost do anything. You can
make wishes come true, essentially. Yeah, he

512
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:05,321
definitely skewed that average. But was it enough?
What do you think, Joseph? I think there's

513
00:49:05,341 --> 00:49:11,018
an interesting balance here. between how weak
Dorothy is, but how strong her imaginary friends

514
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:16,923
are. And then Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur are
somewhere in between that power spectrum. So

515
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:21,247
I think the matchup is gonna be close. I do
think that the scales are ultimately gonna

516
00:49:21,287 --> 00:49:27,352
tip toward Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur though.
So we did a poll on Instagram and 64% of those

517
00:49:27,372 --> 00:49:32,157
who voted, voted in favor of Moon Girl and Devil
Dinosaur. Do you think it's gonna be over or

518
00:49:32,237 --> 00:49:36,738
under that? I think it's going to be under that.
I think it's going to be a closer match. But

519
00:49:36,758 --> 00:49:41,380
that was definitely a popularity contest poll.
We even had some people ask us like, who the

520
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:46,161
heck is Dorothy Spinner? To which case, I got
to say, read and or watch Doom Patrol because

521
00:49:46,201 --> 00:49:51,843
it's awesome. You have to watch Doom Patrol
on Max. It's a great show. And its final season

522
00:49:51,883 --> 00:49:57,724
is wrapping up here soon. But let's find out
who won. AJ 9K, the results, please. Hey, you

523
00:49:57,804 --> 00:50:04,591
are, sir. The winner of the matchup between
Dorothy Spinner and Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur

524
00:50:05,091 --> 00:50:11,076
is Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur. Hell yeah.
I was hoping to see that coming. I was hoping

525
00:50:11,096 --> 00:50:18,941
she'd win this one. It was close. Moon Girl
and Devil Dinosaur won 57.1% of the matches

526
00:50:19,081 --> 00:50:26,006
or 571 out of 1000 compared to Dorothy Spinner
and her imaginary friend who only won 42.9.

527
00:50:27,047 --> 00:50:31,354
So that was pretty close. If you had asked me
leading into this. Whether or not I thought

528
00:50:31,414 --> 00:50:36,037
Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur even stood a chance
against Dorothy Spinner, I would have said

529
00:50:36,057 --> 00:50:42,760
you're out of your mind. Well, it's really all
about Moon Girl's intelligence, right? Considering

530
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:48,003
that she is likely the most intelligent person
in the Marvel universe, she has a lot going

531
00:50:48,023 --> 00:50:52,786
for her. Probably more than you ever realized.
Way more than Dorothy Spinner, I think. It's

532
00:50:52,846 --> 00:50:57,188
not down to the intelligence. You know what
it's down to? What? The fucking system, man.

533
00:50:57,428 --> 00:51:02,592
The fucking system. What? Yeah, it's like there's
no way that Dorothy Spinner would go into this

534
00:51:02,652 --> 00:51:09,299
match with only one imaginary friend, but it's
way too complicated to pit two characters against

535
00:51:09,339 --> 00:51:14,544
like 20. Well, that's why we had the composite
imaginary friend. It's not good enough. It's

536
00:51:14,584 --> 00:51:19,448
not good enough. The system's broken. I think
it sounds pretty accurate myself. But, you

537
00:51:19,468 --> 00:51:23,919
know, anytime Marvel wins. It always sounds
highly accurate to me. It does make me wonder

538
00:51:23,939 --> 00:51:28,922
though, how we're gonna run the stats for next
week's team duel between Doom Patrol and Guardians

539
00:51:28,942 --> 00:51:34,985
of the Galaxy if we count Dorothy Spinner as
multiple beings. I don't know if we can actually.

540
00:51:35,305 --> 00:51:39,647
We might have to do a composite of her as well
with the imaginary friend. That'll be interesting.

541
00:51:40,068 --> 00:51:44,810
That will be interesting. We'll have to figure
that out. Considering those seven versus seven,

542
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:50,553
matrices simulations take a long time to run.
Yeah, ton of time. Even two versus two takes

543
00:51:50,593 --> 00:51:56,937
a while. Yeah. I hope you feel bad. I hope you
feel bad for Dorothy Spinner. She's had a hard

544
00:51:56,977 --> 00:52:02,700
life and you don't make it any easier. Well,
geez, I do feel bad for her as a character,

545
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:07,683
but also, you know, Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur
deserve this win. So there you go. All right.

546
00:52:07,703 --> 00:52:12,885
I guess if you can live with that guilt. That
does it for this duel. Let us know what you

Doom Patrol and the Guardians of the Galaxy.

557
00:53:07,339 --> 00:53:13,143
Can I wait for that? Doom Patrol is going down
and it is gonna be very satisfying. I just

558
00:53:13,183 --> 00:53:18,105
imagine it's going to be like the most bizarre
team duel that we've ever had. I guarantee

559
00:53:18,125 --> 00:53:21,955
it. For sure, for sure. But that does it for
