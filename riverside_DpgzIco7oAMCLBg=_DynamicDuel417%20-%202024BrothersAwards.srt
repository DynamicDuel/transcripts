7
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:33,531
show.

8
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:58,088
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

9
00:00:58,528 --> 00:01:03,351
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based

10
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:09,634
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother, Johnny DC. And in this episode,

11
00:01:09,795 --> 00:01:16,598
we are going to count down the best that Marvel
and DC put out in the year 2024 with our 9th

12
00:01:16,738 --> 00:01:22,574
annual Brothers Awards episode. Yeah, this is
a super fun episode every year. Although Prior

13
00:01:22,594 --> 00:01:27,557
years have probably been more fun because this
wasn't a great year for Marvel and DC films

14
00:01:27,617 --> 00:01:32,601
I would say. Whoa, speak for yourself. You can
talk shit about DC all you want to, but leave

15
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:37,244
Marvel alone. No no no. You did not have a bad
year whatsoever. Marvel put out shit in the

16
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:43,229
theaters this year. No, they didn't. And also,
they put out great content on Disney+. Oh that's

17
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:47,612
weird. Apparently Joseph loves Sony's Spider-Verse
everyone. He just admitted it.

18
00:01:50,614 --> 00:01:55,677
We'll talk all about what shows and movies are
getting our awards later on this episode. Before

19
00:01:55,697 --> 00:01:58,699
that we're going to break down the latest comic
book movie news to come out this past week,

20
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:04,383
of which there was just one news item and that
was the official trailer for the Your Friendly

21
00:02:04,403 --> 00:02:09,266
Neighborhood Spider-Man television series. As
always we list our segment times in our episode

22

34
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:16,873
which pits your favorite action heroes from
film and television against each other. This

35
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:22,458
week, hosts Scotty and Gilly are finding out
who would win in a fight between Godzilla and

36
00:03:22,638 --> 00:03:28,203
Gamera. On the Sendrow World Podcast, host Zachary
Heppern speculates on fights between fan favorite

37
00:03:28,303 --> 00:03:33,527
anime and manga characters. Last week, Zach
wasn't able to put out his Shinra from Fire

38
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:39,631
Force vs. Najima from a Dick in a Box episode.
So he will be doing that this week. And on

39
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:43,993
the console, Combat Podcasts hosts John and
Dean simulate battles between popular video

40
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:48,515
game characters. In yesterday's episode, they
found out who would win between Shadow the

41
00:03:48,555 --> 00:03:54,778
Hedgehog and Black Zero from Mega Man. Visit

the DynaMic Podcast Network. But with that

43
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:06,898
out of the way, quick to the new prize. A no
prize is an award Marvel used to give out to

44
00:04:06,938 --> 00:04:12,320
fans. Our version, the dynamic Duel no prize,
is a digital award that we post on Instagram

45
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:18,361
for the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week we asked,

46
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:24,983
on a scale of 1 to 10, how excited has the official
teaser trailer for Superman made you for James

47
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:31,385
Gunn's DCU? And why? And we got a whole lot
of answers this week, 8 in total, so let's

48
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:36,376
go ahead and count down our 3 honorable mentions.
as well as the no prize winner. Our first honorable

49
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:43,282
mention goes to Daniel Alonso, who said, From
one to 10, one, I guess, because I can't pick

50
00:04:43,322 --> 00:04:50,548
zero. I mean, Superman is one of the most boring
characters of all time. I don't care, I've

51
00:04:50,648 --> 00:04:59,235
never cared. And then adding crypto, like, why?
The animals in DC are so boring, no one cares.

52
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:05,131
The only version of Superman I've ever. And
it pains me to say liked is Henry Cavill's,

53
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:11,213
but God, I do not care at all about this movie.
Did I say this was an honorable mention? Because

54
00:05:11,273 --> 00:05:16,976
I meant it was a dishonorable mention. It's
so ironic that you are saying Superman is the

55
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:24,759
most boring character because I thought that
was your mom. What? Why are you getting personal?

56
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:29,061
He didn't get personal. He just said he doesn't
like Superman as a character because he's boring,

57
00:05:29,341 --> 00:05:35,316
which is a valid criticism. Well, I feel personally
attacked because I loved this trailer and I

58
00:05:35,356 --> 00:05:39,958
don't see how anyone could say it was boring
because like I mentioned, when we were discussing

59
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:44,221
the trailer in our last episode, we see a side
of Superman, a more human side that we really

60
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:49,324
haven't seen on screen before. For people who
think that the character of Superman is boring,

61
00:05:49,384 --> 00:05:54,507
do you think James Gunn's Superman movie will
be the one to turn them around? If it doesn't,

62
00:05:54,747 --> 00:05:58,749
I don't know what can. And what do you have
to say to the people who think that Superman

63
00:05:58,809 --> 00:06:04,529
is boring? You are on the wrong side of history,
my friends. Wrong side. I know that a lot of

64
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:09,633
people thought that characters like Captain
America were boring prior to those MCU films

65
00:06:09,653 --> 00:06:15,056
coming out. So I really hope that the Superman
movie does for the character of Superman that

66
00:06:15,216 --> 00:06:20,980
Captain America was able to do for Steve Rogers.
And then some, because Steve Rogers is still

67
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:27,165
pretty boring. You know what, Daniel Alonso,
you're right. Good job. Our next honorable

68
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:33,011
mention goes to. Travis Herndon who said, What's
up Dun and Medoos, Travis here, shout out to

69
00:06:33,051 --> 00:06:37,972
my Evil Twins. So my scale would have to be
a seven and a half out of ten. I think it looks

70
00:06:38,012 --> 00:06:43,574
really good, looks promising. The costumes and
stuff, still gotta get used to those, but everything

71
00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:50,276
else looks pretty good. The music is just amazing.
I mean, I'm a sucker for rock ballads. So honestly,

72
00:06:50,356 --> 00:06:56,282
yeah, looks promising to me, but I'm not putting
my hopes up until I see the movie myself. And

73
00:06:56,302 --> 00:07:02,525
that's fair. It's fair to delay judgment until
you see the final film in terms of how you're

74
00:07:02,545 --> 00:07:08,028
going to feel about James Gunn taking over the
DCU. The trailer may be great, but that does

75
00:07:08,088 --> 00:07:13,711
automatically mean that his DCU will be great,
although I hope it will be. So was the teaser

76
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:19,215
trailer great? I thought so. Yeah, I thought
it was fantastic. I think I'm more along the

77
00:07:19,255 --> 00:07:25,402
lines of Travis Herndon here. I'm at a steady
like maybe seven, six and a half. kind of in

78
00:07:25,442 --> 00:07:30,467
terms of excitement level. Like the teaser trailer
wasn't mind-blowingly awesome. It didn't blow

79
00:07:30,507 --> 00:07:35,652
me away. I thought it was pretty good. It was
a great Superman movie trailer. As I mentioned,

80
00:07:35,812 --> 00:07:40,076
again, last episode, I didn't really have too
many expectations and maybe that's why this

81
00:07:40,116 --> 00:07:46,042
trailer exceeded mine. I will totally admit
that, but I can't help but love what I saw.

82
00:07:46,082 --> 00:07:51,322
I remember back in like 2012 when we got the
first teaser trailer for Man of Steel, and

83
00:07:51,382 --> 00:07:55,625
I remember being blown away by that. I thought
that was a fantastic teaser. I don't know if

84
00:07:55,665 --> 00:07:59,908
the trailer for this most recent iteration of
Superman quite lived up to that. I think it

85
00:07:59,928 --> 00:08:04,992
was hard to really gauge that the first Man
of Steel teaser trailer was a Superman movie

86
00:08:05,272 --> 00:08:10,456
because we got shots of like a butterfly on
a porch swing and a guy walking down the road

87
00:08:10,476 --> 00:08:16,921
with a beard. It wasn't as much of a Superman
movie as it was just like a fairly decent looking

88
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:22,143
movie in general. I liked the music for that
one, though I do have to say, as Travis Herndon

89
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:26,506
mentioned, the rock ballad that they use here
of John Williams' original score hit me way

90
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:30,768
harder than I thought it would. Like when he's
saving that young girl and the music is just

91
00:08:30,828 --> 00:08:37,151
swelling, I was like, holy crap, tears in my
eyes. Tears in my eyes. Oh my god, get over

92
00:08:37,171 --> 00:08:42,614
yourself. Tears coming out of my eyes, bro.
Thanks Travis Herndon for your answer. Our

93
00:08:42,654 --> 00:08:49,682
next honorable mention goes to Mason Thompson,
who said, What's giddy? Plain and simple, 10

94
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:56,125
out of 10. I love it, because I like how much
it pops. I think James Gunn does that very

95
00:08:56,165 --> 00:09:01,928
well. And I think he represents more hope than
Henry Cavill did. I don't know what it is about

96
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:11,632
it, it just does. And then Guy Gardner's bowl
cut, mwah. I like the actor for Lex Luthor,

97
00:09:11,972 --> 00:09:18,959
and I like Mr. Terrific, so 10 out of 10. Yeah,
one of the major criticisms of the DCEU was

98
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:26,301
how dark it was, not only in terms of themes,
but also in terms of the cinematography. The

99
00:09:26,401 --> 00:09:31,142
colors in this new Superman movie looks like
they really are going to pop and really jump

100
00:09:31,222 --> 00:09:36,104
at you on the screen. I was actually pretty
amazed by how striking the visuals were in

101
00:09:36,144 --> 00:09:41,105
this trailer. And that's partly why I think
people are getting a much more hopeful vibe

102
00:09:41,145 --> 00:09:47,101
from this universe. If you're a DC fan who reads
DC comics, seeing things like Guy Garner's

103
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:51,505
bowl cut, that's all really exciting because
it feels like for the first time we're getting

104
00:09:51,545 --> 00:09:58,811
a pretty close translation of the comics characters
to the screen in a more faithful way than perhaps

105
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:02,874
we've had in the past. Well, it means that you're
getting a shared universe like right out of

106
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:08,419
the gate. Right. Yes, exactly. It's a risky
move to jump in the deep end like that, but

107
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:13,506
we'll see if it pays off. My body is ready.
Great answer, Mason. We want to give a quick

108
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:19,508
shout out to Jarell, who called in for the first
time. Thanks for calling in. John Storosky,

109
00:10:19,848 --> 00:10:25,289
Josh Hayward, and Michael Williams for taking
the time to visit our website and record an

110
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:32,371
answer. But the winner for this week's No Prize
is Miggy Mathengian, who said, hey, what's

111
00:10:32,391 --> 00:10:36,292
up, guys? This is Miggy. And on a scale from
1 to 10, it would be a million. The Superman

112
00:10:36,312 --> 00:10:42,042
teaser trailer got me super hyped. It's everything
I wanted and more. We got to see. the hope

113
00:10:42,062 --> 00:10:47,905
that Superman really embodies. We got to see
him saving people and being who he is. We got

114
00:10:47,925 --> 00:10:54,009
to see crypto and the terrifics and the Daily
Planet staff like Lois and his classic enemies

115
00:10:54,029 --> 00:10:58,972
like Lex. And a lot of people agree with me
because it is the fifth most viewed trailer

116
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:06,116
of all time. The fact that Warner Brothers Studios
has been around as long as it has and Superman

117
00:11:06,156 --> 00:11:12,427
has become its most viewed trailer. bodes really,
really well for this movie. It's the number

118
00:11:12,487 --> 00:11:16,890
five most viewed trailer of all time. And if
you look at the four above it, they're all

119
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:21,952
Marvel films. Deadpool and Wolverine actually
just set the number one record earlier this

120
00:11:21,992 --> 00:11:28,156
year, but also all four of them went on to gross
over a billion dollars. I'm not saying that

121
00:11:28,196 --> 00:11:34,659
means Superman is going to gross over a billion
dollars, but man, what a precedent. Does high

122
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:39,934
trailer views on YouTube correlate to enjoyment
of the trailer? Or do you think a lot of them

123
00:11:39,954 --> 00:11:46,698
were hate views? No, no one hate watches stuff
that many times. It's it's hype factor. It

124
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:52,701
officially has like the biggest hype factor
of a Warner Brothers or DC movie ever, apparently

125
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:56,863
right at the gate. It's awesome. I hate watched
it a few times. I'm just going to say that.

126
00:11:57,303 --> 00:12:02,826
You know what? That's fine. Keep adding to it.
The numbers. Anyone who didn't like the trailer

127
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:07,129
should definitely hate watch it at least five
or six more times. And the movie in theaters

128
00:12:07,169 --> 00:12:11,707
as well. Right. Go hate watch that. At least
three times. Well congrats to Miggy for winning

129
00:12:11,727 --> 00:12:15,534
this week's No Prize. If you the listener want
a shot at winning your own No Prize, stay tuned

130
00:12:15,554 --> 00:12:19,441
to later on this episode when we'll be asking
another Question of the Week. And now that

131
00:12:19,461 --> 00:12:21,164
that's done, onto the news!

132
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:31,013
Alright, this past week we got our first official
trailer for the Your Friendly Neighborhood

133
00:12:31,073 --> 00:12:37,017
Spider-Man series, which is going to debut in
January of 2025, so just in a few weeks here.

134
00:12:37,537 --> 00:12:42,220
It's pretty late to be getting a trailer, but
maybe that's because when I watched it I didn't

135
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:47,424
like too much of anything that I saw. I'm just
gonna say it right off the bat. I didn't love

136
00:12:47,464 --> 00:12:53,248
this trailer. What didn't you like about it?
Okay, so for a bit of context, this show was

137
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:59,010
originally going to be Spider-Man Freshman and
it was going to be a look at the MCU version

138
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,272
of Peter Parker, you know, the Tom Holland version.
It was basically going to be his origin story.

139
00:13:03,592 --> 00:13:10,114
But the show was later retooled to be an alternate
universe version of Peter Parker. You know,

140
00:13:10,154 --> 00:13:13,835
this is definitely not the MCU version of Peter
Parker. But you know, there's supposed to be

141
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:19,376
a lot of parallels here. One of the parallels
we see here is that instead of Tony Stark mentoring

142
00:13:19,576 --> 00:13:23,786
Peter Parker, it's going to be Norman Osborn,
which is an interesting take. Yeah, and instead

143
00:13:23,806 --> 00:13:28,531
of getting the Iron Spider suit, he gets like
the Future Foundation suit. Yeah, that's one

144
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:32,696
of the things I don't like. That's at the end
of the trailer. But yeah, it is weird that

145
00:13:32,996 --> 00:13:37,221
Spider-Man's initial Spider-Man costume outside
of his homemade one is going to be the Future

146
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:43,608
Foundation, which, of course, in the comic books
is a white and black Spider-Man outfit that

147
00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:49,771
was given to Peter Parker. By Reed Richards,
Mr. Fantastic, when he formed the Future Foundation

148
00:13:49,931 --> 00:13:54,552
in honor of Johnny Storm, who at the time had
died in the Negative Zone in the comic books.

149
00:13:55,152 --> 00:14:00,774
And it was a science organization and it was
a cool looking outfit. But it is weird for

150
00:14:00,794 --> 00:14:05,575
that to be his first, like, official outfit
within this particular universe. So that was

151
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:10,136
like one of the things I didn't like. I also
don't really like his initial homemade outfit.

152
00:14:10,296 --> 00:14:15,342
Like, it doesn't have the goggles from the MCU
version of Spider-Man that we saw. Like it

153
00:14:15,382 --> 00:14:18,825
comes with his curved eye lenses, like right
off the bat, which I thought was a little bit

154
00:14:18,865 --> 00:14:23,308
weird. But also the suit doesn't look very appealing,
despite the fact that it's supposed to be,

155
00:14:23,348 --> 00:14:27,652
you know, homemade. Yeah, it's almost more like
Scarlett Spider's costume. Well, yeah, I mean,

156
00:14:27,812 --> 00:14:32,596
that's what inspired Tom Holland's version of
his homemade outfit. But I really liked the

157
00:14:32,616 --> 00:14:36,118
way they took that one, where it was like a
hoodie, you know, with the goggles. Here we

158
00:14:36,138 --> 00:14:40,750
have more like a sports jersey with the curved
lenses and everything like that. He's wearing

159
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,012
a backpack which holds his web fluid which is
connected to his wrists via these hose cables.

160
00:14:45,672 --> 00:14:50,574
It's all just very different. I didn't like
some of the scenes that we got here where Spider-Man

161
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:56,597
is beating up a bunch of high school bullies.
He straight up web slings a brick into one

162
00:14:56,617 --> 00:15:01,239
of the kid's head. I'm pretty sure he commits
murder in the course of this trailer. It just

163
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:06,721
seems a little bit violent for the character.
I'm not anti-cartoon violence, but I'm pretty

164
00:15:06,761 --> 00:15:10,995
sure... that in the next shot where we see the
kid who got hit in the head with a brick, he's

165
00:15:11,055 --> 00:15:16,658
totally comatose. And I don't know, it's just,
it's weird. This feels a little bit nitpicky,

166
00:15:17,038 --> 00:15:21,380
but everything just falls in line with my prior
biases that I had developed against the show.

167
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,202
We see Peter Parker say deuce is out. I thought
that was fucking weird. It is cool to see Liz

168
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:30,565
Allen and Nico Minoru within the trailer. I'm
really interested in seeing what they do with

169
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:35,062
Nico if she's gonna get her staff of one. and
maybe there's gonna be like a runaways tie

170
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:38,924
in with this particular series. That would be
really cool. But that would be one of the few

171
00:15:38,964 --> 00:15:42,846
things that I would be looking forward to. I
understand your criticisms, though I guess

172
00:15:42,926 --> 00:15:47,248
I am surprised that you didn't like this. I
didn't care for it too much. I definitely thought

173
00:15:47,268 --> 00:15:51,750
you were going to like it more than I did. I
actually did like the animation style. It reminded

174
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:57,432
me very much of like a Silver Age kind of Steve
Ditko approach. But that said, I could also

175
00:15:57,472 --> 00:16:02,739
criticize that because I would much rather see.
then continue the what-if animation style for

176
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,642
MCU projects, just to keep that branding, essentially.
No, I mean, I don't need that at all. I mean,

177
00:16:08,682 --> 00:16:14,165
look at X-Men 97. Well, that's not in the MCU.
Neither is this, you know? And actually, now

178
00:16:14,185 --> 00:16:18,968
that I mentioned that, the ideal version of
this project, considering how good X-Men 97

179
00:16:19,008 --> 00:16:24,671
was, would have been for them to make Spider-Man
98, which is the year that the 90's Spider-Man

180
00:16:24,711 --> 00:16:28,973
cartoon ended. And that cartoon was fantastic.
You know, it was a quintessential Spider-Man

181
00:16:29,013 --> 00:16:33,704
cartoon. which came out concurrently with the
X-Men 90s cartoon. So I think I would have

182
00:16:33,724 --> 00:16:38,947
preferred that a million times more than what
we're getting here with this strange quasi

183
00:16:39,067 --> 00:16:45,030
MCU take on Spider-Man. Yeah, that seemingly
has one foot in the MCU and one foot out. Yeah.

184
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:51,554
I get it. I would have loved to have seen like
year one of the MCU Peter Parker. Yeah, I either

185
00:16:51,574 --> 00:16:56,677
wanted freshman year or Spider-Man 98. This
whole criticism of the trailer just feels like

186
00:16:56,717 --> 00:17:00,118
me bitching and moaning. But I think a lot of
people would at least agree that what could

187
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:04,300
have been for this show would have been better.
So when we review this, are you going to count

188
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:09,082
that against this show? No, I'm going to try
to go in as objective as possible. You know,

189
00:17:09,322 --> 00:17:13,324
for everything that I'm saying about the show,
it could have really tremendously well-written

190
00:17:13,384 --> 00:17:17,906
stories. And in that case, I'm going to rate
it accordingly. But I just want to on the record

191
00:17:17,946 --> 00:17:22,128
basically that this show probably could have
been something better. Well, who knows? Maybe

192
00:17:22,148 --> 00:17:27,598
we'll end up seeing this version of Spider-Man
in the Beyond the Spider-Verse movie. or in

193
00:17:27,638 --> 00:17:31,004
Secret Wars or something, who knows. I guess
we'll find out how good the show is when it

194
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:36,595
starts streaming on Disney Plus on January 29th.
But speaking of people's anticipation and excitement

195
00:17:36,615 --> 00:17:39,560
levels, for this series that brings us to our
question of the week.

196
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:49,554
On a scale of 1-10, how excited has the Friendly
Neighborhood Spider-Man trailer made you for

197
00:17:49,574 --> 00:17:54,779
the series, and why? This question is kind of
similar to last week's question about the Superman

198
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,843
trailer, but it's going to be about this animated
series. Record your answer at dynamicduel.com

Be sure to answer before January 4th.

204
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,352
That does it for all the news for this episode.
So let's go ahead and move on to our main event,

205
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:37,075
which will be the 2024 Brothers Awards instead
of like going with a purple carpet or a red

206
00:18:37,095 --> 00:18:40,997
and blue striped carpet. Jonathan, let's go
with the carpet whose fibers are like red on

207
00:18:41,097 --> 00:18:45,119
one side and blue on the other. So like the
carpet changes color as people walk on it.

208
00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:50,983
No, no, no. Two separate carpets. All right.
Yeah, let's segregate the Marvel fans from

209
00:18:51,003 --> 00:18:56,005
the DC fans. You're right. Red carpet goes to
the back door. Blue carpet goes to the front.

210
00:18:56,758 --> 00:19:01,125
The red carpet goes to the glass elevator. Anyway,
we're getting too caught up on this carpet

211
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:06,173
thing, but let's go ahead and get seated for
the 9th Annual Brothers Awards.

212
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:21,206
All right, everybody, welcome to the 2024 Brothers
Awards. It is the premiere event that we hold

213
00:19:21,346 --> 00:19:26,450
every year on this show where we award the best
onscreen content to come out from Marvel and

214
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:31,313
DC. Yeah, it's an award show that we've done
every year since the podcast started back in

215
00:19:31,353 --> 00:19:35,616
2016. If you've listened to one of our award
shows before, you'll know that the Brothers

216
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:41,701
Awards are actually named after the Marvel and
DC Red and Blue Brothers that represented their

217
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:48,267
respective universes. in the DC vs Marvel comic
mini series that came out in the 90s. Yeah,

218
00:19:48,307 --> 00:19:53,608
we award these statuettes to Marvel and DC Media
in 10 different categories, including Best

219
00:19:53,649 --> 00:19:59,930
Trailer, Best Original Music, Best New On-Screen
Character, Best Villain, Best Hero, Best Moment,

220
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:07,292
Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Series Slash
Special, and finally Best Picture. Ten different

221
00:20:07,312 --> 00:20:12,634
categories, each with four nominees from which
we pick the winner. Yeah, anything that came

222
00:20:12,714 --> 00:20:19,160
out in theaters or on a streaming platform is
eligible to win. For Marvel, in 2024 that included

223
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:25,064
the theatrical films Madame Web, Deadpool and
Wolverine, Venom the Last Dance, and Kraven

224
00:20:25,105 --> 00:20:32,010
the Hunter. And on streaming, there was Echo
Season 1, X-Men 97 Season 1, Hitmonkey Season

225
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:38,976
2, Agatha All Along Season 1, and What If Season
3. So 9 different Marvel projects eligible

226
00:20:39,016 --> 00:20:46,260
for a Brothers Award in 2024. Whereas DC had
13, that included the feature films Justice

227
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:54,084
League Crisis on Infinite Earths Part 1, Part
2, and Part 3, Watchmen Chapters 1 and 2, and

228
00:20:54,244 --> 00:21:01,008
Joker Folie a Deux. For streaming services we had
Dead Boy Detective Season 1, My Adventures

229
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:09,573
with Superman Season 2, Suicide Squad Isekai
Season 1, Batman Caped Crusader Season 1, Kite

230
00:21:09,613 --> 00:21:16,717
Man Hell Yeah! Season one and the Penguin season
one. A lot of season ones here. A lot of content

231
00:21:16,777 --> 00:21:21,159
for sure. Although not as much as previous years.
I think largely due to the writer's strike,

232
00:21:21,499 --> 00:21:29,504
but enough to work with. That's what you say.
No, this was a tough year. I feel like for

233
00:21:29,564 --> 00:21:35,287
DC and Marvel too for both of us. Not really,
no. Yes, don't lie. Don't lie to yourself.

234
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:40,774
Let's go ahead and get started with our first
category, which is best trailer. The way I

235
00:21:40,814 --> 00:21:45,356
picked the nominees and the winner for best
trailer are the trailers that not only got

236
00:21:45,376 --> 00:21:50,899
me very excited for the upcoming project, but
also I think gave us something new and exciting.

237
00:21:51,339 --> 00:21:56,742
Yeah, it should be noted that the content eligible
for this award was not necessarily on our list

238
00:21:56,822 --> 00:22:01,905
of projects that came out in 2024. Right. They
could be trailers for projects that come out

239
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:08,409
in 2025. Let me run down the Marvel nominees.
The nominees are Captain America Brave New

240
00:22:08,449 --> 00:22:15,218
World Official Trailer. Your inner circle's
been compromised. Let me fix it. Watch yourself.

241
00:22:15,238 --> 00:22:22,504
You're not Steve Rogers. You're right. I'm not.
Deadpool and Wolverine. Official teaser. You

242
00:22:22,524 --> 00:22:28,529
don't just stand there, you ape. Give me a hand
up. Nope, I'm actually okay. Thank you very

243
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:38,997
much. Thunderbolts. D23 Brazil special look.
You are all so adorable. Eat shit, Valentina.

244
00:22:43,286 --> 00:22:47,379
Venom The Last Dance Final Trailer What's his
name then?

245
00:22:51,068 --> 00:22:51,816
We have something in me.

246
00:22:54,954 --> 00:23:01,580
That's a solid lineup. If I had to guess which
one of those gets the win this year, that's

247
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:06,544
tough. It might be the Thunderbolts because
I know you like the TOTY's Possum Kingdom that

248
00:23:06,604 --> 00:23:11,148
song was used in the Thunderbolts trailer. But
I also really liked the style of the Brave

249
00:23:11,188 --> 00:23:15,813
New World trailer. So I think I'm going to go
with that. That's my guess. And the winner

250
00:23:15,913 --> 00:23:22,378
is. Captain America, Brave New World official
trailer. Alright, you guessed correctly right

251
00:23:22,418 --> 00:23:26,920
out of the gate. Yeah, Captain America Brave
New World was a different kind of trailer for

252
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,862
Marvel. You know, they've never really put out
something that stylistic ever really. You know,

253
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:37,424
the trailer didn't have the typical Marvel Studios
title card. It was heavily stylized with like

254
00:23:37,484 --> 00:23:43,307
split screenshots and kind of creepy sound effects
and everything like that just really evoked

255
00:23:43,427 --> 00:23:48,489
the best political thrillers ever made. Yeah,
there was no music. There were no jokes. It

256
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:54,056
felt very off brand for Marvel. but also it
was really intriguing. Yeah, the trailer was

257
00:23:54,076 --> 00:23:59,261
a big swing for Marvel, I feel like, and it
gets me excited for the future of Marvel trailers

258
00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:04,165
and how stylistic they're willing to go with
them from here on out. And also excited for

259
00:24:04,285 --> 00:24:09,110
Captain America Brave New World. I am really
pumped to see that now. Regarding the other

260
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:13,774
nominees, I nominated Venom, The Last Dance
final trailer, because that was when we got

261
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:17,777
word that Null was gonna be in the movie. We
didn't know that before, so that got me super

262
00:24:17,817 --> 00:24:23,108
pumped. Of course, the D23 Brazil special look
for Thunderbolts was fantastic. It was an extended

263
00:24:23,168 --> 00:24:29,051
preview for the film and Deadpool and Wolverine.
The teaser for that film came out around the

264
00:24:29,091 --> 00:24:34,114
Super Bowl, and it just got me all sorts of
hyped. Like we didn't even see Wolverine in

265
00:24:34,154 --> 00:24:39,077
that preview until we see his shadow walk over
Deadpool laying on the ground and his claws

266
00:24:39,117 --> 00:24:42,659
pop. And then we get the official title of the
movie, which was Deadpool and Wolverine. So

267
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:47,282
that was all just very exciting. But yeah, Captain
America Brave New World gets the win. for its

268
00:24:47,322 --> 00:24:53,771
stylistic choices. Great year for Marvel trailers,
absolutely. Also a great year for DC trailers.

269
00:24:53,871 --> 00:25:02,103
And let me get into my nominations. The nominees
for best DC trailer are Joker, Folie a Deux, official

270
00:25:02,143 --> 00:25:04,065
teaser trailer. Whoa.

271
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:29,229
The Penguin Season 1 Official Teaser 2 Suicide
Squad Isekai Season 1 Official Trailer 3

272
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,965
Superman official teaser trailer

273
00:25:44,174 --> 00:25:46,380
crypto Home david home

274
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:54,036
I think this one's pretty clear cut. I think
you're going to give it to Superman because

275
00:25:54,216 --> 00:25:58,783
even though it's a mid trailer, you just seem
to really be gung-ho for it. So that's my guess.

276
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:07,343
And the winner is... Superman Official Teaser
Trailer. Yeah, you're absolutely right. I gave

277
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:12,488
this one the award, not only because it was
the most recent one and very top of mind, but

278
00:26:12,528 --> 00:26:17,853
also because of, again, how hyped it gets me
for James Gunn's universe as a whole. It's

279
00:26:17,973 --> 00:26:23,118
really awesome to be a DC fan right now and
have something like an entirely new universe

280
00:26:23,178 --> 00:26:28,083
to look forward to, especially after a trailer
like this that makes you fairly confident in

281
00:26:28,303 --> 00:26:33,090
the quality and tone that universe will have.
I think prior to the release of the Superman

282
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:39,432
trailer, you were most excited by the Joker
Folly-A-Do trailer. I almost gave that one

283
00:26:39,452 --> 00:26:47,594
the win because that teaser trailer was incredible.
What the World Needs Now, a song by Tom Jones,

284
00:26:48,054 --> 00:26:52,675
just fit perfectly with the tone and the footage
that they were showing. It looked like it was

285
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:59,337
going to be another masterpiece from Todd Phillips,
and it really set my expectations unbelievably

286
00:26:59,377 --> 00:27:05,886
high. dashed on the rocks below once the movie
finally came out and we all saw it. Yeah, that

287
00:27:05,906 --> 00:27:10,070
was definitely an instance of the trailer being
better than the movie. Yeah. Regarding the

288
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:14,434
other two nominees, the Penguin Season 1, Official
Teaser 2, and Suicide Squad Isekai Season 1,

289
00:27:14,794 --> 00:27:20,199
Official Trailer 3, I chose those largely because
they also got me really excited and pumped

290
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:25,684
for the upcoming projects. I was actually really
happy with just about every trailer that came

291
00:27:25,764 --> 00:27:30,106
out for DC this year. Well, let's go ahead and
move on to our next category, which is best

292
00:27:30,266 --> 00:27:37,608
original music. Music in movies and television
have a way of moving and affecting audiences

293
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:43,370
in a way they may not even realize. A good score
can go a long way in setting the tone for a

294
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:49,592
film and our emotional response to it. Yeah,
the way I usually judge a film's music is by

295
00:27:49,692 --> 00:27:55,814
how evocative it is of the material you're seeing
on the screen. If it's iconic. That's a big

296
00:27:55,854 --> 00:28:00,756
bonus. And of course, I try to pick out what's
unique as well. This category encompasses both

297
00:28:00,796 --> 00:28:07,078
the score and original songs that were made
for the movie. DC had some great music this

298
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:14,721
year, and let me go over my nominees. The nominees
for best DC original music are Dead Boy Detectives,

299
00:28:15,081 --> 00:28:15,741
season one.

300
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,066
Joker, follow ya'll do.

301
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:48,748
I'll follow you. Take my hand. Stay here, my
friend. The Penguin, season one.

302
00:28:59,082 --> 00:29:06,195
may be trouble ahead. Suicide Squad Isekai,
Season 1.

303
00:29:20,962 --> 00:29:26,425
These are good options. The music for The Penguin
was fantastic, but I think ultimately you're

304
00:29:26,445 --> 00:29:31,209
gonna give it to Suicide Squad Isekai, because
the music for that show was just next level.

305
00:29:31,689 --> 00:29:39,314
And the winner is Joker, Ballyadoo. What? No!
Are you joking me? You think I wouldn't give

306
00:29:39,374 --> 00:29:47,820
it to a musical that had good music? The songs
for that movie sucked. No, you are wrong, my

307
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,319
friend. If you listen to the soundtrack, of
Joker Folly I do, it's actually a really damn

308
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:57,481
good soundtrack. And it actually had multiple
soundtracks. Not only did it have the score

309
00:29:57,521 --> 00:30:03,345
from Hilda Gunnedadder, which crushed it, it
also had an original soundtrack featuring songs

310
00:30:03,425 --> 00:30:09,008
from Lady Gaga and Joaquin Phoenix. And on top
of that, Lady Gaga released a side album called

311
00:30:09,088 --> 00:30:13,850
Harley Quinn, featuring a lot of the same music
from the movie, as well as some original songs

312
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:20,830
that she composed, which just blew my mind how
classic they sound. The movie was terrible,

313
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:27,973
but amidst the garbage that was on the screen
was not the music. You know, you usually have

314
00:30:28,213 --> 00:30:34,136
a controversial choice every year. And I think
this is your controversial choice for this

315
00:30:34,156 --> 00:30:39,418
year. I think you're going to get a lot of flack
from fans when they see this award being posted

316
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:43,540
to Instagram, but I think you at least you have
a good reasoning behind this one, better reasoning

317
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:49,683
than you have had in past years with your controversial
choices. I'm going to share the albums with

318
00:30:49,723 --> 00:30:53,946
you and I hope you listen to them. And I think
you'll agree with me at the end of the day.

319
00:30:54,406 --> 00:31:02,812
I won't listen to it. OK. Dead Boy Detectives,
the Penguin, both had really solid scoring

320
00:31:02,872 --> 00:31:08,596
throughout the series. Suicide Squad was interesting
also in that it had original music from artists

321
00:31:08,656 --> 00:31:13,419
like Maury Kaliope, which was used in the end
credits for each episode. Yeah, those songs

322
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:16,966
were bangers. And that was, I think, the clear
winner. here.

323
00:31:45,522 --> 00:31:46,876
Echo, season one.

324
00:32:01,622 --> 00:32:03,060
Hit Monkey Season 2

325
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:18,717
Kraven the Hunter.

326
00:32:34,122 --> 00:32:40,467
have to say that the music choices they made
for Hit Monkey season two were phenomenal but

327
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:46,993
I don't know how many of those were original
to the show. Agatha all along was the closest

328
00:32:47,093 --> 00:32:52,498
thing that Marvel had to a musical this year
so I think that's gonna get the win. And the

329
00:32:52,538 --> 00:32:59,725
winner is Agatha all along season one. Alright
you're just nailing the guesses so far. Two

330
00:32:59,765 --> 00:33:05,844
for two! Yeah, Agatha all along season one did
things with music that we haven't seen since

331
00:33:05,924 --> 00:33:12,667
Wandavision in that we had a lot of original
music and the score for the show itself was

332
00:33:12,727 --> 00:33:18,509
top notch. It was incredible to listen to. Echo
had a lot of great original songs, including

333
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:23,411
some really awesome Native American music, as
well as a very heavy desert rock sounding riffs.

334
00:33:24,432 --> 00:33:29,518
Hit Monkey, as always, is just a fantastic show
that not only includes a lot of great pulls

335
00:33:29,678 --> 00:33:35,681
in their soundtrack, but the score itself is
a great mix of rock and EDM and hip-hop and

336
00:33:35,761 --> 00:33:40,944
R&B. It's just fantastic to listen to. Kraven
the Hunter I included on here largely because

337
00:33:40,984 --> 00:33:45,487
I thought it was more unique than the other
options that Marvel had released this year

338
00:33:45,627 --> 00:33:51,110
in that Kraven had a lot of music with strong
African influences and traditional Russian

339
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:55,873
music. I don't think I even really noticed the
score from Kraven. Well, I'll send you the

340
00:33:55,913 --> 00:34:00,006
link to the album and you can check it out.
I will listen to it if you listen to all three

341
00:34:00,046 --> 00:34:06,268
Joker albums. I won't. Then fuck off. Let's
go ahead and move on to our next category,

342
00:34:06,608 --> 00:34:11,909
which is best new on screen character. Now we
like to give this award to the characters that

343
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:17,471
are new and surprising and hopefully exciting
on the big and small screen. You know, a lot

344
00:34:17,511 --> 00:34:22,112
of the reason why fans enjoy watching these
movies and shows is to see who's going to be

345
00:34:22,232 --> 00:34:26,013
adapted next and what they're going to look
like and what their powers are going to be

346
00:34:26,053 --> 00:34:31,047
portrayed as. So this is always an exciting
award. Yeah, specifically the nominees eligible

347
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:37,970
for this award are characters that appear for
the first time within a specific universe.

348
00:34:38,331 --> 00:34:42,793
Right, yeah, when you talk about the multiverse,
things get a little bit tricky because you

349
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:48,595
may see new iterations of characters that you've
seen previously, but we consider a new adaptation

350
00:34:48,635 --> 00:34:54,615
essentially to be a new version of the character.
Let's get into the Marvel Award. The nominees

351
00:34:54,676 --> 00:35:00,749
for best Marvel new on-screen character are
Gambit from Deadpool and Wolverine.

352
00:35:05,642 --> 00:35:08,033
Null from Venom the Last Dance.

353
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,752
Kraven the Hunter from Kraven the Hunter.

354
00:35:20,534 --> 00:35:23,705
Wiccan from Agatha All Along, Season 1.

355
00:35:28,562 --> 00:35:33,103
Oh, interesting. Does Wiccan technically count?
Because we've seen the character in the MCU

356
00:35:33,223 --> 00:35:38,025
earlier. Yeah, but that wasn't even the same
kid. And I'm not talking just about actor wise.

357
00:35:39,066 --> 00:35:43,708
And if you've seen Agatha all along, you'll
know what I'm talking about. OK. Either way,

358
00:35:43,748 --> 00:35:49,050
I don't think he got the win. I think the winner,
hands down, is Gambit from Deadpool and Wolverine.

359
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:57,193
And the winner is Wiccan from Agatha All Along,
season one. Wow. Controversial choice. All

360
00:35:57,213 --> 00:36:03,623
right. This is yours. Is it? Here you go. So
we've seen Wiccan in the WandaVision television

361
00:36:03,663 --> 00:36:09,805
series that came out back in 2021, but that
wasn't really the official version of the character.

362
00:36:09,845 --> 00:36:14,246
He was just wearing a Halloween costume and
it was more of an Easter egg than anything.

363
00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:19,508
In Agatha all along, we got to see the fully
realized version of Wiccan from the comic books

364
00:36:19,988 --> 00:36:25,269
who had the full costume and all of his magic
powers. And I thought it was a great adaptation,

365
00:36:25,329 --> 00:36:32,724
especially in the way that they chose to adapt
the character of Billy Kaplan. How he was once

366
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:36,806
Billy Maximoff. I don't want to give away too
many spoilers because there are more to be

367
00:36:36,846 --> 00:36:42,108
had there. But it was just a beautiful story.
And I thought Joe Locke did a fantastic job

368
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:47,370
playing the character and out of all the new
characters that were debuted this year, I think

369
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:53,973
I'm most interested in seeing more of the story
of Wiccan. Nah, not Gambit. I want that Gambit

370
00:36:54,013 --> 00:36:58,703
movie. I will be surprised if we see Channing
Tatum back in the role again. Like maybe he'll

371
00:36:58,723 --> 00:37:02,404
have another cameo in the Secret Wars movie
or something like that. But I don't think he's

372
00:37:02,924 --> 00:37:08,705
the MCU's long term gambit. I don't think he's
the MCU's gambit, but I think we'll definitely

373
00:37:08,765 --> 00:37:14,927
see him again. For sure in Secret Wars. I will
bet money on that. Yeah, I wouldn't take that

374
00:37:14,967 --> 00:37:20,789
bet. Now, Wickham, he did a good job. Actually,
all of your nominees were pretty awesome on

375
00:37:20,829 --> 00:37:26,064
this list. Noel wasn't seen too much. Kraven
was, you know, Aaron Taylor Johnson did a good

376
00:37:26,084 --> 00:37:31,988
job acting, even though it was Kraven in name
only. But I still would have chosen Gambit

377
00:37:32,188 --> 00:37:36,091
if it was my award. You thought he was going
to make a name for himself here? Hoo yeah,

378
00:37:36,131 --> 00:37:43,817
boy. Well, let's move on to the DC award. The
nominees for best DC new onscreen character

379
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:48,501
are Charles Rowland from Dead Boy Detectives
Season 1.

380
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:56,902
Edwin Payne from Dead Boy Detectives Season
1.

381
00:38:01,634 --> 00:38:05,099
Harleen Quinzel from Joker Folie a Deux.

382
00:38:09,826 --> 00:38:13,097
Victor Aguilar from The Penguin, season one.

383
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:22,945
Oh, this is a lackluster list. I have no idea
what direction you're going to go with this,

384
00:38:23,045 --> 00:38:28,109
but I think my own personal choice would probably
be Charles Rowland from Dead Boy Detectives.

385
00:38:28,649 --> 00:38:35,974
And the winner is Victor Aguilar from The Penguin
season one. OK, yeah, I can totally see why

386
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:40,597
you went this route for me, I think just due
to the fact that the character was original

387
00:38:40,637 --> 00:38:45,180
to the series. And so it was an exciting as
an adaptation from the source material. It

388
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,938
would have been the reason why I didn't choose
him. I had a tough time choosing the winner

389
00:38:48,978 --> 00:38:53,599
for this award this year. I really wanted to
give it to Charles Rowland. He was my runner

390
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:58,701
up because I thought the actors who were in
the Dead Boy Detectives did a fantastic job

391
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:03,342
with their performances and the show is just
really cool. Ultimately though, I gave the

392
00:39:03,362 --> 00:39:09,043
win to the character that I think had the biggest
impact on me and that had to be Victor Aguilar

393
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:16,025
from The Penguin. I grew to really love that
character as the season progressed and I don't

394
00:39:16,045 --> 00:39:21,695
want to give away any spoilers. But what happens
to him in the end of that show is devastating.

395
00:39:21,875 --> 00:39:27,316
And I feel like I'm still devastated by that.
It was a fantastic show, largely in part because

396
00:39:27,396 --> 00:39:32,978
of a character like Victor. For sure. That final
episode of The Penguin had a lasting impression.

397
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:38,139
And Renzi Feliz gave a great performance as
well. Absolutely. Give the guy an Emmy. Let's

398
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:43,081
go ahead and move on to the next category, which
is best villain. Of course, a hero is only

399
00:39:43,121 --> 00:39:48,434
as good as his villain. I found that. What really
makes a good Marvel and DC television show

400
00:39:48,474 --> 00:39:53,416
or movie is the quality of the villain. You
know, a project that has a weak villain usually

401
00:39:53,456 --> 00:39:58,237
isn't that impressive. So we like to give accolades
to the best villains from this year. Yeah,

402
00:39:58,297 --> 00:40:02,878
villains, you love to hate them, but they really
set the stakes for the projects that they're

403
00:40:02,978 --> 00:40:09,000
in. And story wise, stakes are huge. It's the
whole reason for why the hero fights the good

404
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:16,945
fight. Let's start with DC. The nominees for
best DC villain are Esther Finch from Dead

405
00:40:16,966 --> 00:40:18,713
Boy Detectives Season 1.

406
00:40:23,426 --> 00:40:26,824
Harleen Quinzel from Joker Folie a Deux.

407
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:35,516
Joker from Suicide Squad Isekai Season 1.

408
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:44,144
Sophia Falcone from The Penguin, season one.

409
00:40:48,966 --> 00:40:53,867
Oh, man, I was about to say that this was a
lackluster list until you got to that final

410
00:40:54,107 --> 00:40:58,728
nominee. I think you're definitely going to
give it to Sophia Falcone. And the winner is.

411
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:06,671
Sophia Falcone from the Penguin season one.
All right, I finally got one. Yeah, we got

412
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:11,372
Superman the trailer, too. But you're getting
two for four. So if you felt Cohn was a no

413
00:41:11,412 --> 00:41:16,733
brainer on this list, although I did love the
Joker twist at the end of Suicide Squad, Isakai.

414
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:23,913
but for a majority of the Penguin series, Sophia
Falcone was just remarkable as a villain and

415
00:41:23,953 --> 00:41:29,817
antagonist for Oswald Cobb. I guess I'm most
surprised by your nominees that you included

416
00:41:29,937 --> 00:41:36,140
Harley Quinn in Joker Follyado. Did you consider
her the villain of that movie? Cause I would

417
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,584
have figured it was probably like Harvey Dent.
No, I thought Lee Quinzel was a much bigger

418
00:41:42,964 --> 00:41:47,578
antagonist for Arthur Fleck. than Harvey Dent
was, even though Arthur Fleck probably would

419
00:41:47,618 --> 00:41:52,780
not admit that. Or maybe like the security guard.
He'd definitely be a villain as well. I guess

420
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:58,161
it's arguable as to who the main antagonist
was. But for my money, that was Lee Quinzel.

421
00:41:58,621 --> 00:42:05,123
She was awful. I hated her. Was Esther Finch
the witch in Dead Boy Detectives? Yes. OK,

422
00:42:05,163 --> 00:42:11,105
yeah, she was great. She was fantastic, but
not as great as Kirsten Melody as Sophia Falcone.

423
00:42:11,365 --> 00:42:15,986
She knocked it out of the park. episode to episode.
She was essentially the second star of the

424
00:42:16,006 --> 00:42:20,908
show. And I wasn't thrilled initially that she
was going to be the lead villain of the series,

425
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:27,330
but I thought she was put to use expertly in
having Azkab rise to the role of the Penguin.

426
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:32,111
And performance wise, Kristen Milioti scared
the shit out of me. So yeah, she was very effective

427
00:42:32,251 --> 00:42:39,193
as a villain. Yes, hands down. Give her the
Emmy. Let's move on to the Marvel Award. The

428
00:42:39,253 --> 00:42:45,109
nominees for best Marvel villain are Bastion
from X-Men 97 Season 1

429
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:52,449
Cassandra Nova from Deadpool and Wolverine.

430
00:42:57,154 --> 00:42:59,872
Death from Agatha All Along, season 1.

431
00:43:04,654 --> 00:43:06,731
Kingpin from Echo Season 1.

432
00:43:11,578 --> 00:43:18,342
Oh damn, this is a really good list. That's
a hard choice to make. I guess I'm gonna go

433
00:43:18,362 --> 00:43:24,687
with Bastion from X-Men 97 because I think he
was the most complex villain. And the winner

434
00:43:24,787 --> 00:43:35,746
is Bastion from X-Men 97 Season 1. Woohoo! Am
I that predictable? Yes. Yeah, Bastion was

435
00:43:36,046 --> 00:43:43,149
an incredible villain for X-Men 97. Not only
did he continue the themes of the X-Men animated

436
00:43:43,189 --> 00:43:49,012
series into this new season, but he also posed
like a great, like modern threat to the team

437
00:43:49,412 --> 00:43:55,074
in this day and age that felt very in keeping
with who the X-Men are. And he did a lot of

438
00:43:55,114 --> 00:43:59,796
damage in that show. You think about what happened
on Genosha. He was a very effective villain.

439
00:44:00,276 --> 00:44:05,059
Absolutely. And the wrap up they did with him
at the end. was so powerful in terms of like

440
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:09,941
the story arc for Cyclops. It was such a great
season of television, which is why we gave

441
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:14,364
it five out of five stars when we reviewed the
show. Right. He played a large part of that.

442
00:44:14,784 --> 00:44:20,587
Yeah, I forget the actor who did his voice,
Theo James. Oh, yeah. He did a fantastic job

443
00:44:20,627 --> 00:44:24,569
as well. I loved that. That was great. Yeah,
I hope he plays the character in live action

444
00:44:24,629 --> 00:44:29,952
if they ever bring Bastion into the live action
MCU. The live action actors on your list weren't

445
00:44:29,992 --> 00:44:34,662
bad, terrible, like Aubrey Plaza as Death. That
was a great twist. Yeah, and Kingpin was the

446
00:44:34,702 --> 00:44:40,584
best thing about Echo season one. And Cassandra
Nova, of course, was just really interesting

447
00:44:40,604 --> 00:44:44,925
and pretty damn cool in Deadpool and Wolverine.
Yeah, very spunky. Well, let's move on to our

448
00:44:44,965 --> 00:44:50,907
next award, which is best hero of 2024. Of course,
this is the opposite of the villain award,

449
00:44:51,267 --> 00:44:56,729
whereas the villains set the stakes. The heroes
are there to overcome them in the story. Yeah,

450
00:44:56,749 --> 00:45:01,760
we like to give recognition to the heroes that
inspire us. and provide the whole reasoning

451
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:08,269
that we watch these tales of morality play out.
Starting off with the Marvel Award, the nominees

452
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:13,697
for best Marvel hero are Cyclops from X-Men
97 Season 1.

453
00:45:18,414 --> 00:45:20,716
Deadpool from Deadpool and Wolverine.

454
00:45:25,378 --> 00:45:27,751
Venom from Venom the Last Dance.

455
00:45:32,546 --> 00:45:34,804
Wolverine from Deadpool and Wolverine.

456
00:45:39,638 --> 00:45:49,909
Holy crap. Wow. I think Cyclops had a really,
really good arc, but so did Wolverine and Deadpool

457
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:57,258
and Wolverine. So I'm gonna go with Wolverine.
And the winner is Deadpool from Deadpool and

458
00:45:57,298 --> 00:46:03,496
Wolverine. Oh, controversial choice. Is it?
No, I don't think so. I think if you remember

459
00:46:03,536 --> 00:46:10,342
the arc from Deadpool and Wolverine that Deadpool
had, I think it was the most depth we got of

460
00:46:10,382 --> 00:46:14,965
the character in all of his film trilogy. You
know, he started out with a really touching

461
00:46:15,025 --> 00:46:20,250
moment talking about how he wants to matter
and, you know, getting rejected from the Avengers

462
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:25,134
affected his entire life. He really grew as
a character through the course of the film

463
00:46:25,454 --> 00:46:30,802
and was really pleased with his journey, as
goofy as it sometimes may be. I think he really

464
00:46:30,842 --> 00:46:36,063
grew as a character and as a hero. I guess I
kind of thought his arc was just an upgraded

465
00:46:36,103 --> 00:46:40,244
version of what we got in Deadpool 2, which
you know is still a solid arc for the character.

466
00:46:41,024 --> 00:46:46,146
I would have given it maybe to Wolverine because
of what that version of the character went

467
00:46:46,166 --> 00:46:51,767
through and what he learned from X-23 and everything
like that. But I could totally see giving it

468
00:46:51,787 --> 00:46:56,929
to Deadpool as well. Honestly, all of the character
arcs from all four of your nominees were solid.

469
00:46:57,329 --> 00:47:04,723
Yeah, yeah. He was a standout hero from that
series. Venom, you know, the way that movie

470
00:47:04,783 --> 00:47:10,289
ended was very much in keeping with the heroic
theme of sacrifice. So yeah, all these guys

471
00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:16,936
were great. Yeah. Great choices this year. Moving
on to the DC award. The nominees for best DC

472
00:47:16,976 --> 00:47:21,961
hero are Batman from Batman caped Crusader season
one.

473
00:47:26,766 --> 00:47:30,512
Harley Quinn from Suicide Squad Isekai Season
1.

474
00:47:35,234 --> 00:47:39,005
Kite Man, from Kite Man, Hell Yeah, Season 1.

475
00:47:43,782 --> 00:47:47,503
Superman from My Adventures with Superman Season
2.

476
00:47:52,470 --> 00:48:00,892
I have to say your lists are not up to scratch.
You can go fuck yourself. The Marvel lists

477
00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:06,954
have been much more solid than these lists.
I find it hard to pick from your list of nominees

478
00:48:07,074 --> 00:48:12,275
primarily because I don't see a good standout
option. I'm gonna go with Batman from the Caped

479
00:48:12,315 --> 00:48:19,777
Crusader season one. And the winner is Superman
from My Adventures with Superman season two.

480
00:48:20,237 --> 00:48:27,569
Sure, yeah, why not? I think on that way too.
So I love my adventures with Superman as a

481
00:48:27,629 --> 00:48:34,673
show. I think they do a fantastic job reinventing
the character for modern times. In season one,

482
00:48:34,773 --> 00:48:40,216
Superman's arc really revolved around who he
was. And in the second season, it was more

483
00:48:40,276 --> 00:48:45,599
about where he comes from and what that means
in regards to the relationships that he's developed

484
00:48:45,739 --> 00:48:50,201
on the show. I thought they did a fantastic
job introducing characters like Supergirl and

485
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:56,453
Brainiac. for Superman to interact with. And
again, I just really like how heroic the character

486
00:48:56,813 --> 00:49:01,996
of Superman is in the show compared to some
of the other heroes on my list, such as Batman,

487
00:49:02,256 --> 00:49:07,460
Harley Quinn, and Kite Man. Well, Superman is
the quintessential hero, right? Portrayed correctly,

488
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:12,363
he would always win this award. And I think
My Adventures with Superman does just that.

489
00:49:12,403 --> 00:49:16,205
It's a fantastic show for sure. Yeah, this is
actually the second year in a row that he's

490
00:49:16,265 --> 00:49:21,271
won this award. I was thinking of giving it
to Batman, the caped crusader, because that

491
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:26,873
was just as good of a show, I think, as my adventures
with Superman season two. But Batman kind of

492
00:49:26,893 --> 00:49:32,255
played a second fiddle in that show to the city
of Gotham itself. I would agree. Yeah. Like

493
00:49:32,315 --> 00:49:36,817
you want to keep Batman mysterious too, you
know? Right. Exactly. That really helped with

494
00:49:36,837 --> 00:49:37,657
that show, actually.

495
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:50,734

502
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:36,665
Let's go ahead and move on to the next category,
which is Best Moment. Now, this is one of my

503
00:50:36,705 --> 00:50:42,029
favorite awards to hand out because I like going
back and thinking about the moments that really

504
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:47,774
stood out to me from Marvel and DC projects.
These are the occurrences on film and television

505
00:50:47,814 --> 00:50:54,260
that really got you up on your feet cheering
or like just despondent emotionally. But these

506
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:58,383
are the moments that you remember for years
to come. Yeah, the nominees for this award

507
00:50:58,423 --> 00:51:04,519
consist of the most impactful moments. from
the past year. Let's start with the DC Award.

508
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:12,053
The nominees for best DC moment are Escape from
Hell, Dead Boy Detectives, season one.

509
00:51:21,806 --> 00:51:30,876
Joker questions Gary Puddles from Joker Folly-a-doo.
Was I the same old Joker that I always been?

510
00:51:33,139 --> 00:51:39,987
Oh, it's the Tugtelist yourself. Magical Armor
Op from Suicide Squad, Isekai, season one.

511
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:53,085
Get out of here! Oz and Victor's farewell from
The Penguin, Season 1.

512
00:52:00,398 --> 00:52:05,300
I can't bring you with me this time. Alright
now this list is impressive. For as much shit

513
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,442
I'm giving you about your other lists, I actually
think that these are all standout moments.

514
00:52:09,602 --> 00:52:14,624
I don't think anything will stick with me as
much as Oz and Victor's farewell though. So

515
00:52:14,684 --> 00:52:21,715
that's my guess for the win. The winner is...
Oz and Victor's farewell from the Penguin season

516
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:29,099
one. It has to be. Yeah. To me, this was hands
down the most impactful moment from, I think,

517
00:52:29,339 --> 00:52:35,243
any DC show in recent memory. It was heartbreaking.
You know, DC has had some pretty heartbreaking

518
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:40,686
season finales. I think back to the Doom Patrol
moment from that show's series finale. And

519
00:52:40,706 --> 00:52:46,069
that was pretty heartbreaking, too. Yeah, that
Doom Patrol moment won a Brothers Award earlier.

520
00:52:46,669 --> 00:52:51,064
And I would have to say that This packed just
the same amount of punch, which is surprising

521
00:52:51,525 --> 00:52:55,648
because with the Doom Patrol characters, we
had been with them for several seasons. But

522
00:52:55,869 --> 00:53:00,353
when it comes to The Penguin, only having one
season to establish its characters, it was

523
00:53:00,373 --> 00:53:05,658
just a better produced show overall, I would
say, as much as I like The Doom Patrol. And

524
00:53:05,698 --> 00:53:11,543
it's something that'll stick with me for some
time, particularly this moment, which is one

525
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:16,467
of the reasons we gave the show 5 out of 5 stars.
Yeah, I liked your other moments too, like

526
00:53:16,507 --> 00:53:21,230
the scene in Suicide Squad Isekai where they
get their power up armor in the final episode.

527
00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:27,094
That was so much fun. That was a blast. Yeah,
totally. Honestly, if this was like an award

528
00:53:27,134 --> 00:53:32,778
for the happiest moment out of all of the shows,
that would get the win. The escape from Hell

529
00:53:32,818 --> 00:53:37,561
scene was also pretty powerful from Dead Boy
Detectives. Right, yeah. And of course, Joker

530
00:53:37,601 --> 00:53:43,025
questioning Gary Puddles may have been the best
part of Joker Folie a Deux. Great list, great

531
00:53:43,045 --> 00:53:48,178
list. Now I kind of feel like my list is a little
bit shallow, but these are all stand-up moments

532
00:53:48,198 --> 00:53:54,424
too. Let's get into the Marvel Award. The nominees
for Best Marvel Moment are... Deadpool Core

533
00:53:54,804 --> 00:53:56,065
from Deadpool and Wolverine.

534
00:54:05,944 --> 00:54:08,706
I am Uwatu from What If Season 3.

535
00:54:25,706 --> 00:54:27,835
Let's go, boy. Take her down!

536
00:54:32,014 --> 00:54:37,888
To me, my X-Men from X-Men 97 Season 1. To me,
my X-Men.

537
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:51,304
Oh, is that in reference to the Sentinel fight
in episode one of the X-Men 97 show? Yes. OK,

538
00:54:51,344 --> 00:54:56,406
that's interesting to me. Honestly, I think
the most impactful moment from X-Men 97 would

539
00:54:56,426 --> 00:55:02,729
have been what happened in Genosha. So already
your list is flawed. I was looking for like

540
00:55:02,769 --> 00:55:08,751
quintessential moments, I guess. Gotcha. Well,
it was nice just to see the X-Men come back,

541
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:14,470
I suppose, after all these years. But of those
options that you gave me of the nominees. I

542
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:22,014
would say the Deadpool core is your choice.
And the winner is Deadpool core from Deadpool

543
00:55:22,115 --> 00:55:27,098
and Wolverine. Of course, you know, it was such
a fantastic moment. There were so many great

544
00:55:27,178 --> 00:55:31,801
climaxes in the third act of the Deadpool and
Wolverine movie, which is I think why it got

545
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:35,863
over a billion dollars. People just love this
movie because you had the fight with, you know,

546
00:55:35,923 --> 00:55:40,710
blade electric gambit against Cassandra Nova's
forces. followed up by the Deadpool fight,

547
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:45,393
followed up by the sacrifice by Deadpool and
Wolverine at the end. But the fight against

548
00:55:45,433 --> 00:55:52,156
the Deadpool core was not just musically powerful
and heavy on the action and a visual effects

549
00:55:52,196 --> 00:55:58,180
tree. It was everything rolled into one. It
was so much fun to watch. And I think that

550
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:02,202
moment will stay with me for years to come as
well. I know it will. Yeah, it was incredibly

551
00:56:02,322 --> 00:56:10,066
fun. It was two of four climaxes that happened
while I was watching this movie. I don't know

552
00:56:10,087 --> 00:56:14,510
what the fourth one was, but I don't want to
know. I don't know if you've seen What If Season

553
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:19,154
3 yet, Jonathan, but I will... I haven't finished
it. So I had no idea what the Watu reference

554
00:56:19,194 --> 00:56:24,698
was. The season ends on a bang. We'll get into
it in our next episode when we review What

555
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:31,044
If Season 3. The season's not fantastic, but
the finale is pretty much everything you could

556
00:56:31,064 --> 00:56:36,168
hope for in a finale. Nice. That's good to hear.
And of course, release of Symbiotes was another

557
00:56:36,188 --> 00:56:40,871
big action scene. It was really cool to see.
the varying symbiotes that the movie introduced.

558
00:56:41,011 --> 00:56:45,374
That was just a whole lot of fun, too, in the
same way that Deadpool core fight was. Yeah,

559
00:56:45,414 --> 00:56:49,457
it was all right. It was definitely not as good
as Deadpool. So I think you had a solid choice

560
00:56:49,477 --> 00:56:56,002
there. Well, moving on to the next award. This
is for the best actress of twenty four. Yeah,

561
00:56:56,042 --> 00:57:03,267
we love our actresses. Love me some actresses.
It's always fun to give out acting awards,

562
00:57:03,307 --> 00:57:08,414
because in that sense, it feels like we're the
Oscars, right? But. Yeah, the basis of this

563
00:57:08,454 --> 00:57:15,138
award is who we think gave the best performance
in a Marvel or DC project this year. We're

564
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:19,501
way better than the Oscars. Like those are not
even relevant anymore. Yeah, if you win a Brothers

565
00:57:19,541 --> 00:57:24,704
Award, it means something. Like put it on your
resume, right? 100%. Well, let's see what actress

566
00:57:24,744 --> 00:57:31,969
gets to do that. The nominees for best Marvel
actress are Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova from

567
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:33,229
Deadpool and Wolverine.

568
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:42,921
Catherine Hawn as Agatha Harkness from Agatha
All Along Season 1

569
00:57:47,598 --> 00:57:52,305
Patti LuPone as Lilia Calderou from Agatha All
Along Season 1.

570
00:57:57,074 --> 00:58:01,605
Sashir Zamata as Jennifer Cale from Agatha All
Along, Season 1.

571
00:58:07,082 --> 00:58:11,624
Like all of your nominees basically came from
Agatha. Interesting. Emma Corrin was from Deadpool

572
00:58:11,664 --> 00:58:18,768
and Wolverine. I said almost all. No, you didn't.
I said basically all. I said something like

573
00:58:18,808 --> 00:58:26,252
that. Anyway, of the nominees, I'd probably
say that you went with the star of Agatha all

574
00:58:26,292 --> 00:58:33,506
along, who was Catherine Hahn. And the winner
is. Catherine Hawn as Agatha Harkness from

575
00:58:33,646 --> 00:58:38,908
Agatha All Along Season 1. I am killing it.
You are crushing it, man. You are crushing

576
00:58:38,948 --> 00:58:44,189
it. Yeah, Agatha All Along had a stellar cast
and really these nominees were just a testament

577
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:50,071
to the fantastic actresses that they got for
that show. You know, Patti LuPone and Sashir

578
00:58:50,091 --> 00:58:55,492
Zamata were playing minor characters but had
major roles within the show and I was really

579
00:58:55,552 --> 00:59:00,658
impressed with the caliber of performances that
we got in that series. But, you know, Catherine

580
00:59:00,678 --> 00:59:06,261
Hahn led the whole thing and I thought she stood
up to the task. As a leading lady, she really

581
00:59:06,281 --> 00:59:10,743
impressed me and definitely went up a tier from,
you know, just a supporting role in WandaVision.

582
00:59:11,203 --> 00:59:16,806
Yeah, she was fantastic. She had a lot of different
roles to play, I guess you could say. Everything

583
00:59:16,866 --> 00:59:22,408
from, you know, dramatic to comedic to doing
a musical number. It was probably an actress's

584
00:59:22,448 --> 00:59:27,163
dream role. Oh, for sure. And she crushed it.
Yeah. Of course, Emma Corrin was also good

585
00:59:27,243 --> 00:59:30,766
in Deadpool and Wolverine. Jonathan, I guess
I'm a little bit surprised that you're surprised

586
00:59:30,786 --> 00:59:34,990
by my list. I'm wondering who you would have
added like Dakota Johnson from Madden Web.

587
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:41,235
What would you have done? Probably not Dakota
Johnson, but probably Sydney Sweeney. OK, OK.

588
00:59:42,496 --> 00:59:46,620
No, honestly, I'm actually surprised you went
with Emma Corrin over Aubrey Plaza for death.

589
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:51,976
Aubrey Plaza was in consideration. but I'm still
convinced that the character of Death was Aubrey

590
00:59:52,016 --> 00:59:57,660
Plaza just stumbling onto the set one day, acting
like her normal self. Hahaha. She just is Death.

591
00:59:58,061 --> 01:00:03,165
Yeah. Gotcha. Well, great choice. I think Catherine
Hahn definitely deserves this award. Moving

592
01:00:03,225 --> 01:00:12,692
on to DC, the nominees for best DC actress are
Kristen Milioti as Sofia Falcone from The Penguin

593
01:00:12,912 --> 01:00:13,533
Season 1.

594
01:00:18,230 --> 01:00:23,985
Lady Gaga as Harleen Quinzel from Joker, Folly
I Do.

595
01:00:28,878 --> 01:00:34,595
Jen Lyon as Esther Finch from Dead Boy Detectives
Season 1.

596
01:00:39,342 --> 01:00:45,222
Cassius Nelson as Crystal Palace from Dead Boy
Detectives, season one.

597
01:00:49,866 --> 01:00:54,609
Oh, that's a solid list. It's going to be in
between, obviously, Sophia Falcone and Crystal

598
01:00:54,629 --> 01:01:00,793
Palace. But I think it's going to go to Kristen
Milioti as Sophia Falcone. That's my guess.

599
01:01:00,813 --> 01:01:08,659
The winner is Kristen Milioti as Sophia Falcone
from The Penguin season one. Yeah, honestly,

600
01:01:08,679 --> 01:01:14,864
to me, the choice was between Kristen Milioti
and Lady Gaga. I thought Lady Gaga gave a great

601
01:01:14,884 --> 01:01:19,991
performance in the Joker Folly I do, even though.
I hated her character and I hated the movie

602
01:01:20,331 --> 01:01:26,055
overall. Her performance was not one of the
reasons why, but one of the reasons why I absolutely

603
01:01:26,155 --> 01:01:32,540
loved The Penguin was because of Kristen Milioti's
performance as Sofia Falcone. You know, I gave

604
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:37,803
her the best villain award in part because Kristen
Milioti's performance was so impeccable. It

605
01:01:37,823 --> 01:01:43,147
really was. I hope that The Penguin Season 1
really does incredible things for her career

606
01:01:43,187 --> 01:01:48,742
because she deserves it. I've seen her in a
few other projects and she's... just an incredibly

607
01:01:48,942 --> 01:01:53,103
capable actor, just so transformative. I don't
know if I ever would have believed her as a

608
01:01:53,143 --> 01:01:59,085
villain until I saw it done and she was just
so intimidating that it blew my mind. Yeah,

609
01:01:59,105 --> 01:02:04,747
the episode specifically where it goes into
her origin, as it were, in Arkham, that hit

610
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:09,808
really hard and I really hope she wins an Emmy
just for the episode. Give her the Emmy! You're

611
01:02:09,828 --> 01:02:14,966
saying that for every award. Hey, the Penguin
deserves it. Let's go ahead and move on to

612
01:02:15,126 --> 01:02:20,571
our next category, which is best actor. You
know, this award is just like our actresses

613
01:02:20,591 --> 01:02:25,575
award, except the actors are hanging dong instead
of the alternative. I don't know how else to

614
01:02:25,615 --> 01:02:31,680
put it. I've never actually heard that expression
before, but it is accurate. Their actors recommending

615
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:40,807
their performances. Let's do it up. The nominees
for best DC actor are Colin Farrell as Oswald

616
01:02:40,827 --> 01:02:43,509
Cobb in The Penguin Season One.

617
01:02:48,270 --> 01:02:54,060
George Rexdrew as Edwin Payne in Dead Boy Detectives
Season 1.

618
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:04,750
Jaden Reverie as Charles Rowland in Dead Boy
Detectives Season 1.

619
01:03:09,526 --> 01:03:14,815
Joaquin Phoenix as Arthur Fleck in Joker Folie a Deux.

620
01:03:19,618 --> 01:03:27,301
Great list, but it's gotta be Colin Farrell,
final answer. The winner is Colin Farrell as

621
01:03:27,461 --> 01:03:34,924
Oswald Cobb in The Penguin, season one. So like
my best actress list, it really came down to

622
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:41,086
The Penguin and The Joker movies for who I thought
were in contention for this win. I mean, as

623
01:03:41,146 --> 01:03:46,509
great as the Dead Boy Detective guys were, I
mean, it's Colin Farrell and Joaquin Phoenix

624
01:03:46,549 --> 01:03:51,263
giving master class performances. In the end
though, I ended up giving it to Colin Farrell

625
01:03:51,543 --> 01:03:57,548
because I'm still unbelievably shocked that
it's Colin Farrell! It does not look like him.

626
01:03:58,148 --> 01:04:03,852
And as I mentioned in our review, he gives a
technical performance that plays like another

627
01:04:03,952 --> 01:04:09,356
actor giving a method performance. And to me
that's just incredible. I don't even know how

628
01:04:09,376 --> 01:04:14,679
you would classify that, but you're absolutely
right. Colin Farrell deserves all the Emmys

629
01:04:14,859 --> 01:04:20,062
and every single award for his performance as
Oswald Cobb. and I hope he gets it. Give him

630
01:04:20,102 --> 01:04:26,486
the Emmy. Of course, Joaquin Phoenix returning
as Arthur Fleck in a role that won him an Oscar

631
01:04:26,626 --> 01:04:32,529
the last go-around should not be overlooked.
I just felt like we've seen it before. And

632
01:04:32,549 --> 01:04:37,092
though we've also seen Colin Farrell as the
Penguin before, not like this and not to this

633
01:04:37,132 --> 01:04:41,334
depth. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, we previously
saw the character in the Batman movie, but

634
01:04:41,354 --> 01:04:45,096
the Penguin series was much more substantial.
Let's go ahead and move on to the Marvel Award.

635
01:04:45,516 --> 01:04:52,025
The nominees for best Marvel actor are Hugh
Jackman as Wolverine in Deadpool and Wolverine.

636
01:04:56,802 --> 01:05:01,062
Joe Locke as Wiccan in Agatha All Along Season
1

637
01:05:05,782 --> 01:05:09,181
Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool in Deadpool and Wolverine.

638
01:05:13,998 --> 01:05:18,354
Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock slash Venom in Venom
the Last Dance.

639
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:30,373
Wow, this is a solid list. Who to choose? I
want to go with Hugh Jackman, but last time

640
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:35,676
I did that, you gave it to Deadpool. So you
might choose Ryan Reynolds, but I'm going to

641
01:05:35,696 --> 01:05:42,220
stick with my gut and go with Hugh Jackman as
Wolverine as my guess. And the winner is Hugh

642
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:48,683
Jackman as Wolverine in Deadpool and Wolverine.
You son of a bitch. Woohoo! It's like you could

643
01:05:48,723 --> 01:05:54,314
read my mind or something. It's not cool. Stop
doing that. It's weird. Yeah, Hugh Jackman

644
01:05:54,354 --> 01:05:59,418
as Wolverine just when he thought that the guy
couldn't bring anything more to a character

645
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:05,383
that he had already spent over two decades playing
He did and yeah his performance in the movie

646
01:06:05,423 --> 01:06:11,448
I wouldn't say is quite at the level as What
he did in the Logan film, but you know he wasn't

647
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:15,391
the main star of this movie, and he had less
screen time I still thought his performance

648
01:06:15,411 --> 01:06:21,147
was incredible going from a down-and-out Wolverine
you know, severely depressed, giving a really

649
01:06:21,187 --> 01:06:26,770
emotional performance when he admits as to the
reason why he's depressed. He conveyed anger

650
01:06:27,130 --> 01:06:31,572
in a way that we haven't quite seen from the
character before, and he was a great straight

651
01:06:31,592 --> 01:06:37,336
man to Deadpool's Wisecracking Idiot as well.
Yeah, he did the humor great, he did the drama

652
01:06:37,636 --> 01:06:44,840
fantastically. The scene between him and X-23
at the campfire alone gives him this award,

653
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:51,303
I feel. Give him the Emmy. There's no way he's
winning an Oscar for this role. Does Hugh Jackman

654
01:06:51,343 --> 01:06:58,227
even have an Oscar yet? No, he was nominated
for Les Mis, but did not win. That is a travesty.

655
01:06:58,267 --> 01:07:03,931
The guy deserves an Oscar. He's definitely not
gonna get it for this movie, but someday, hopefully.

656
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:08,534
He should have got it for Logan. Yeah, he should
have been nominated for Logan. That's why I

657
01:07:08,554 --> 01:07:13,277
say the Oscars are irrelevant. Yeah, Brothers
Awards, way better. Well, let's move into our

658
01:07:13,317 --> 01:07:19,944
penultimate category. the best series or special
of 2024. Yeah, we live in times now where a

659
01:07:19,984 --> 01:07:25,087
lot more media is being consumed at home as
opposed to on the big screen in theaters. So

660
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:29,870
this award, I think, gets more and more important
every year since we started this podcast. Yeah,

661
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:36,433
this includes television series as well as one
of specials. We actually didn't have any specials

662
01:07:36,774 --> 01:07:43,077
this year. So this is really just the series
category in 2024. Yeah. And Marvel had some

663
01:07:43,137 --> 01:07:49,653
doozies, man. Let me break down those nominees.
The nominees for best Marvel series or special

664
01:07:50,014 --> 01:07:52,821
are Agatha All Along, season 1.

665
01:07:57,610 --> 01:07:59,227
Hit Monkey Season 2.

666
01:08:04,066 --> 01:08:05,635
What if season 3?

667
01:08:10,734 --> 01:08:12,827
X-Men 97 Season 1

668
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:26,797
Oh, this is hands down X-Men 97 season one.
And the winner is. X-Men 97 season one. Of

669
01:08:26,837 --> 01:08:31,640
course. Yeah, that's right. I mean, we reviewed
the show and gave it five stars. I mentioned

670
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:36,902
at the time that it was the quintessential X-Men
experience watching this season, and I still

671
01:08:36,922 --> 01:08:43,164
feel the same way. The MCU has a very difficult
time ahead of itself in adapting the X-Men

672
01:08:43,605 --> 01:08:49,742
as well as the X-Men 97 season one was. Yeah,
not only did it have that nostalgic edge to

673
01:08:49,822 --> 01:08:55,424
it, but also improved animation wise upon what
we remember seeing on Saturday mornings and

674
01:08:55,464 --> 01:09:01,346
brought an even more mature slant to it than
I thought it was even capable of. Yeah, I don't

675
01:09:01,406 --> 01:09:06,687
even think you need the nostalgia factor to
enjoy X-Men 97. It certainly helps, but I think

676
01:09:06,727 --> 01:09:12,469
it stands alone even for fans who are new to
the show. I am super pumped for whatever they

677
01:09:12,509 --> 01:09:17,698
decide to do with that franchise next. I know
we're going to and hopefully it holds up to

678
01:09:17,738 --> 01:09:22,240
season one. If it does, it'll probably go down
in history as the greatest animated superhero

679
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:27,622
series of all time. Just the way it portrayed
the action, the way the characters were written

680
01:09:27,702 --> 01:09:33,525
so true to their comic book counterparts, the
themes that it addressed, it was all done flawlessly.

681
01:09:33,545 --> 01:09:39,547
It was executed so perfectly. Give that show
an Emmy. For real, it was terrific. We gave

682
01:09:39,587 --> 01:09:44,929
both Hit Monkey season two and Agatha all along
four and a half stars. It was a great year.

683
01:09:45,230 --> 01:09:51,013
great year for Marvel Television and also for
DC Television. So let me get into the DC Award.

684
01:09:51,373 --> 01:09:58,877
The nominees for best DC series or special are
Batman Caped Crusader season one.

685
01:10:03,598 --> 01:10:05,823
Dead Boy Detectives, season one.

686
01:10:10,562 --> 01:10:13,257
My Adventures with Superman, Season 2.

687
01:10:18,338 --> 01:10:19,967
Penguin, season one.

688
01:10:24,758 --> 01:10:29,623
Oh geez, I wonder what it's gonna be. That was
a joke. Obviously Penguin season one, final

689
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:37,151
answer. The winner is Batman, Caped Crusader.
Fuck off. It was absolutely The Penguin Season

690
01:10:37,271 --> 01:10:43,074
1. A fantastic show and a year of incredible
DC shows. I also wanted to include Suicide

691
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:47,997
Squad Isekai on my list. Did I have room for
it? Oh, for sure. Yeah, yeah, that was fantastic.

692
01:10:48,017 --> 01:10:51,899
I'm really sad that Dead Boy Detectives got
cancelled. I would have loved to have seen

693
01:10:51,939 --> 01:10:56,582
what they could have done in another season
of that show. But overall, I think the show

694
01:10:56,602 --> 01:11:01,685
that gets me most excited for what's coming
up next is The Penguin Season 1. Not only was

695
01:11:01,845 --> 01:11:07,256
the show incredible, but I also think it was
a tremendous setup for what's ever coming next

696
01:11:07,576 --> 01:11:12,300
in Matt Reeves, the Batman universe. Rumors
are that we are going to get a Penguin Season

697
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:17,343
2, I really hope we do. We'll see if that becomes
official down the road. I mean, as we said

698
01:11:17,383 --> 01:11:25,028
in the review, the Penguin Season 1 was not
just S-tier DC television, it was S-tier television

699
01:11:25,128 --> 01:11:30,992
in general. Oh yeah, it's classic HBO Sunday
night television. It was fantastic. I know

700
01:11:31,032 --> 01:11:36,236
a lot of people who watch the show. who really
aren't into the whole superhero genre, and

701
01:11:36,256 --> 01:11:40,660
they loved it. I loved it, how could you not?
I think this is the first year we've done this

702
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:47,005
show that we awarded two television projects,
five stars, from both Marvel and DC. Yeah,

703
01:11:47,025 --> 01:11:51,028
you might be right. And as I mentioned earlier,
this category has gotten bigger and bigger

704
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:56,052
every year since we started doing this podcast.
Oh yeah, and this year specifically for DC,

705
01:11:56,512 --> 01:12:03,614
the shows vastly outperformed the feature films.
But speaking of feature films, Let's move on

706
01:12:03,654 --> 01:12:11,096
to our final award, best motion picture of 2024.
Yeah, for as big as the television category

707
01:12:11,136 --> 01:12:16,397
is getting, there's still nothing quite like
seeing a film in the big screen in the theater.

708
01:12:17,117 --> 01:12:22,539
It's movie magic. You know, I will say that
for both Marvel and DC, the theatrical offerings

709
01:12:22,579 --> 01:12:28,420
were kind of slim pickings. DC only released
one theatrical film in Joker, Fallia, Do and

710
01:12:28,601 --> 01:12:34,115
Marvel had three Sony Spider-Man movies come
out this year. So. Um, not our best showing

711
01:12:34,195 --> 01:12:40,599
in 2024, but DC also had a lot of direct to
video films that came out this year. And so

712
01:12:41,119 --> 01:12:44,701
yeah, we're going to find out which one wins.
I think we all know what the Marvel winner

713
01:12:44,741 --> 01:12:49,004
is going to be, but I'm really interested in
seeing who the DC nominees are. Well let's

714
01:12:49,044 --> 01:12:57,009
find out. The nominees for best DC motion picture
are Justice League Crisis on Infinite Earths,

715
01:12:57,169 --> 01:12:57,749
part one.

716
01:13:02,614 --> 01:13:06,072
Justice League, Crisis on Infinite Earths, part
two.

717
01:13:10,902 --> 01:13:12,572
Watchmen, chapter one.

718
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:18,825
Watchmen, chapter two.

719
01:13:27,330 --> 01:13:28,139
Shut up, I hate you!

720
01:13:32,342 --> 01:13:36,466
I'm not surprised that JokerFollyIdo did not
make your list of nominees. Oh, absolutely

721
01:13:36,486 --> 01:13:44,133
not. That is not a great list at all. Geez,
Watchmen Chapter 2, I guess. And the winner

722
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:51,607
is... Justice League Crisis on Infinite Earths
Part 1 Oh yeah that's okay yeah the obvious

723
01:13:51,667 --> 01:13:57,949
answer there that was better than Watchmen Chapter
2 yeah Yeah so Watchmen Chapters 1 and 2 if

724
01:13:57,969 --> 01:14:02,790
you listen to our reviews you know I didn't
love them I thought they were largely redundant

725
01:14:02,951 --> 01:14:08,872
and inferior to the adaptation that we received
from Zack Snyder they're not bad they're actually

726
01:14:08,892 --> 01:14:13,830
really faithful adaptations but of all of the
films that came out this year The one that

727
01:14:13,930 --> 01:14:19,611
I thought was absolutely the best, far and away,
was Crisis on Infinite Earth's part one. It

728
01:14:19,631 --> 01:14:24,873
was actually the first film to come out this
year. Yeah, part two was weaker than part one,

729
01:14:24,913 --> 01:14:29,554
and then of course part three dropped the ball
on that trilogy of films completely. But part

730
01:14:29,654 --> 01:14:34,715
one showed a lot of promise, especially with
its non-linear narrative structure. You know,

731
01:14:34,755 --> 01:14:39,517
it was really fascinating to see how that movie
played out. Oh, absolutely. Yeah, the story

732
01:14:39,557 --> 01:14:45,651
of The Flash and his involvement with the Mezzo
and the whole crisis event that was going on

733
01:14:45,971 --> 01:14:51,774
was intermixed with a larger story that was
being told that involved many characters from

734
01:14:51,834 --> 01:14:57,978
across DC's multiverse, particularly the crime
syndicate. It was told in a very interesting

735
01:14:58,058 --> 01:15:03,741
way that was reminiscent of some other projects,
particularly the time traveler's wife. It was

736
01:15:03,761 --> 01:15:09,044
a really strong setup for what I thought the
subsequent two films were going to try and

737
01:15:09,144 --> 01:15:14,278
recapture the magic of, but that didn't quite
happen. Yeah, it was a shame considering how

738
01:15:14,318 --> 01:15:19,979
big of a swing DC animation took with part one
and just couldn't follow through with. Right.

739
01:15:19,999 --> 01:15:25,221
When the first movie came out, we were under
the impression that this was going to be a

740
01:15:25,281 --> 01:15:30,222
heartbreaking finale to the tomorrowverse that
didn't end up being the case, but the movie

741
01:15:30,242 --> 01:15:35,384
is still good. I think you're gonna get flack
for this award, but you shouldn't because,

742
01:15:35,584 --> 01:15:39,885
yeah, it's the most deserving out of all of
DC's films this year. I do feel bad for you.

743
01:15:40,325 --> 01:15:46,910
Yeah, me too. Thank you. Let's get on to the
Marvel Award. The nominees for best Marvel

744
01:15:46,971 --> 01:15:49,793
picture are Deadpool and Wolverine.

745
01:15:54,542 --> 01:15:55,416
Kraven the Hunter.

746
01:16:00,194 --> 01:16:00,860
Madam Webb.

747
01:16:05,782 --> 01:16:07,106
Venom The Last Dance

748
01:16:11,946 --> 01:16:20,173
Let me guess. Madame Web. Nope, just kidding.
And the winner is Deadpool and Wolverine. Obviously.

749
01:16:20,893 --> 01:16:26,398
I mean, you have an MCU film going up against
three Sony films. I am totally shocked that

750
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:31,683
Sony released three Spider-Man Universe films
this year. It was a major faux pas on their

751
01:16:31,723 --> 01:16:36,327
part and they're gonna be paying for that big
time. Hopefully it results in the best case

752
01:16:36,347 --> 01:16:41,010
scenario of Marvel getting the rights back to
Spider-Man because... The only decent film

753
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:45,994
out of the three Sony offerings this year was
Venom The Last Dance, and that even paled in

754
01:16:46,014 --> 01:16:52,059
comparison to the awesomeness that was Deadpool
and Wolverine. The three Sony Spider-Man movies

755
01:16:52,099 --> 01:16:58,324
this year were a joke. Deadpool and Wolverine
was, in my opinion, the best Deadpool movie

756
01:16:58,584 --> 01:17:04,449
that came out. So yeah, I see how this easily
gets the win. 2024 was just... Ugh! I'm so

757
01:17:04,469 --> 01:17:08,399
glad it's over. Yeah, it'll be good to put this
year behind us. And there's a lot of great

758
01:17:08,439 --> 01:17:13,863
projects to look forward to in 2025. At least
the MCU will be releasing more than one movie

759
01:17:13,883 --> 01:17:19,587
in 2025. That's right. You guys are getting
Captain America, Brave New World and Thunderbolts.

760
01:17:19,787 --> 01:17:24,971
And the Fantastic Four in July. Ah, geez. That's
right. I totally forgot about that. We're also

761
01:17:24,991 --> 01:17:28,974
getting a lot of great Disney Plus television
content, too. We were supposed to be getting

762
01:17:29,134 --> 01:17:35,546
a Constantine 2 film next year, but that got
scrapped, I believe. So we're only getting

763
01:17:35,646 --> 01:17:41,211
Superman. It's another year where DC only gets
one theatrical release. But you guys will also

764
01:17:41,231 --> 01:17:46,715
be getting a few direct to video animated films
like Batman Ninja versus the Yakuza League.

765
01:17:48,076 --> 01:17:53,621
Aztec Batman. All the Batman movies, I guess.
Basically, actually, just those three movies

766
01:17:53,661 --> 01:17:59,005
have been announced so far. If there are other
animated projects in the works, we have yet

767
01:17:59,046 --> 01:18:05,284
to hear about them. Well, just another reason
to hope that the Superman movie is good. It

768
01:18:05,304 --> 01:18:10,172
has to be. I think it will be. But that does
it for the awards show this evening guys. Be

769
01:18:10,192 --> 01:18:15,021
sure to reach out to us and let us know who
you think the winners in these categories could

770
01:18:15,041 --> 01:18:22,388
have been. AG9K, help close us out. Thanks for

777
01:19:00,363 --> 01:19:06,108
to catch up. But you saying that it ends with
a bang has me kind of excited because I'm not

778
