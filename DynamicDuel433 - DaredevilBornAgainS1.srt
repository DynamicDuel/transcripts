00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:27,440
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi and welcome
to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:31,740
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,480
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe and I'm his twin

4
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,220
brother Johnny DC. And just a heads up, we are
recording this episode, not even five days after

5
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:47,320
we recorded the last one when my voice was
completely shot. So I do expect my voice to falter

6
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,560
at some point during this episode because there's
a lot to say. I got a lot to talk about because we're

7
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:58,060
going to be reviewing Daredevil Born Again Season
one. And on top of that, we're going to go over the

8
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,060
latest comic book movie news this past week,
including the Thunderbolts Final Trailer, the

9
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:09,060
Fantastic Four Trailer. And we also got the
Sandman Season two date announcement. So my voice

10
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:15,680
is fucked. As always, we list our segment times in
our episode description. So feel free to check out

11

22
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,300
week, including the console combat podcast,
where hosts John and Dean simulate battles

23
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,140
between popular video game characters. In
yesterday's episode, they speculated on who

24
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:32,600
would win in a fight between so bad guy from Guilty
Gear and Ragnar the Blood Edge from Blazblue.

25
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,660
Blazblazblue? Something like that. Over on the
Max Destruction podcast, host Scotty and Gilly,

26
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,980
pet your favorite action heroes from film and
television against each other. This Wednesday,

27
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:49,660
the twins are reviewing the 1995 film Mortal
Kombat. On the Sanjo World podcast, host Zachary

28
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,800
Hepperin speculates on fights between fan
favorite anime and manga characters. On

29
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,400
Thursday, Zach is going to reveal who would win
between Sennaku from Shangri-La Frontier versus

30
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:05,560
Kirito from Sword Art Online. Visit

31
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,880
notes to listen to all of the shows in the DynaMic
podcast network. But with that out of the way,

32
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,680
quick to the no prize. A no prize is an award that
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version, the

33
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,000
dynamic Duel no prize, is a digital award that we
post on Instagram for the person that we feel gave

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,100
the best answer to our question of the week. Last
week, in the absence of any news, we asked you guys,

35
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,960
what's your favorite Marvel or DC comic that
you're reading right now? And why? And we got one

36
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,900
answer. Apparently none of you guys are reading
comics. Well, we also didn't give him a whole lot of

37
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,400
time to respond either. So let's go ahead and
announce this week's no prize winner. Congrats to

38
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:54,540
Zozo. Who said? Hey there. So my favorite comic
series ever is the DC series. In my opinion, it is

39
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:02,440
just the perfect story. It's really cool having
Batman and Superman and Flash just, you know,

40
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:11,020
fight zombies being this zombie world and no one is
safe in it. And it's just very action packed,

41
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:18,060
violent, and it's just a perfect comic series. All
right, thank you. Now, I'm not sure if Zozo said DC

42
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:26,160
or DC's, but either answer is acceptable because,
yes, DC is an awesome series featuring Superman

43
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,000
and Batman, the Flash, and all of your favorite
superheroes. It's been going on since 1938. It's

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,540
freaking amazing. And DC's is one of its most
interesting stories, focusing on the anti-life

45
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,160
equation, infecting everyone and turning them
into zombies, which is just a really cool high

46
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:52,440
stakes story. We went over that story a few years
ago for Halloween during our DC's versus Marvel

47
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,900
Zombies episode, and that was a really fun episode
to do. Yeah, for sure. I recommend listening to

48
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,520
that episode if you have it already, because we had
a lot of fun with it. As Jonathan and I have noted

49
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,360
before on this podcast, we don't get a chance to
read a whole lot of the current comic books out

50
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,740
there because we're so busy reading the comic
books and research for this show, for the duels

51
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:17,320
that we're doing. So I was really looking forward
to getting answers from current Marvel readers.

52
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:22,960
But I know offhand that a lot of people recommend
the ultimate Spider-Man and the Ultimates and

53
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,920
Ultimate Wolverine lines that are coming out
right now. I heard X-Men is really good now that

54
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:33,300
they're out of the Krakowan era. Although I liked
the Krakowan era as well, less than I wanted to,

55
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,340
because I really love Jonathan Hickman as a
writer. But I kind of view his run on the X-Men as

56
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:44,060
kind of like Grant Morrison's run, who I also
respect as a writer. But it was kind of like a

57
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:49,360
contained sort of thing that I'm excited to move on
from and get into the more traditional feel of the

58
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,820
X-Men stories. Yeah, I keep hearing amazing
things about the absolute universe line that DC

59
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:02,520
has right now, like all of these articles are just
bombarding my news feeds about how much better the

60
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:09,580
absolute universe is than DC Prime. I haven't read
any absolute comics yet, but I 100% need to. I'm

61
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,040
just waiting for the trades to come out. I really
want to get my hands on One World Under Doom right

62
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:19,220
now, which I heard is pretty good. It's basically
the story about how Dr. Doom finally becomes the

63
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:24,040
world's dictator. You know, he becomes the one
ruler in charge of the world. And for some reason,

64
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,120
all the other country's leaders are going along
with it. So it sounds pretty interesting. If

65
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,060
anyone didn't get a chance to call in with their
answer, but they still want to share with their

66
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:37,040
reading, feel free to leave us a comment wherever
you're listening to this on, whether it's

67
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:43,220
Spotify, YouTube or shoot us an email. We'd love to
hear from you guys. But congrats to Zozo. You win

68
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,460
this week's No Prize. If you're the listener, want
to win your own No Prize, stay tuned to later on in

69
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:53,420
this episode when we'll be asking another
question of the week. And now that that's done, on

70
00:06:53,420 --> 00:07:03,820
to the news. All right, this past week, we got two
trailers from Marvel Studios. We got the final

71
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:08,740
trailer for the Thunderbolts film, which comes
out on May 2nd, and we also got the first official

72
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,320
trailer for the Fantastic Four first steps movie,
which comes out on July 25th. Since the

73
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,500
Thunderbolts trailer came out first, we'll go
ahead and talk about that one first. And also, I

74
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:23,280
feel like I have less to say about it, because we've
seen so much from the marketing for this movie

75
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,000
already that I don't think there was a whole lot
else that they could show us without, like,

76
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,980
basically spoiling something. I think there's
quite a few surprises to be had in this film. But the

77
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:38,640
trailer took a more kind of sentimental approach
to the story. Like a lot of the previous marketing

78
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:45,320
has been about how this is a team of quirky outcasts
banding together. But this one was more about like

79
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:50,640
what it means to be a hero for these people,
especially Yelena, who feel like they've done so

80
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:56,220
much wrong in their past. And, you know, the
previous trailers have had cool songs like Possum

81
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:02,940
Kingdom by the Totes and Where's My Mind by the
Pixies. This one had Under Pressure by David Bowie

82
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,200
and Queen. And I have to say, it's probably one of
the worst renditions of the song that I've ever

83
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,980
heard, because it was just way too sentimental.
I'm wondering who they're trying to target with

84
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,500
this particular final trailer, because it's so
sappy. You have like Red Guardian telling Yelena

85
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,600
to like believe in herself. And she's like, but
I've done so much wrong. And she's crying and

86
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,600
stuff. I'm like, just go back to being the cool
outcasts. You know? Yeah, you mentioned that they

87
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:29,320
can't really show too much more without giving
spoilers, but I thought this trailer had major

88
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:35,600
spoilers in it. I mean, obviously when Yelena is in
that dark forest, when she's like looking at a

89
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,539
clone of herself or whatever, it's after she
stepped into the void's darkness, which we see at

90
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:46,920
the end of this trailer. She goes into some kind of
like trippy dimension where she's like facing her

91
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,560
inner most demons or some shit. I don't think it's
too revealing of a spoiler. It just means that like

92
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,900
she doesn't die when she walks into that dark
shroud. Well, we already knew she wasn't going to

93
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,980
die because she was announced for the Doomsday
movie. Dumb. I thought it was interesting at the

94
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,620
beginning of this trailer, how they showed a
flashback to Black Widow, which I thought was kind

95
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,520
of cheap a little bit. They're trying to play on
Marvel fans, I guess, nostalgia for the Black

96
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,020
Widow movie, which I don't think there's a whole
lot of. But I don't think it's a good look to try to

97
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,320
use Scarlett Johansson to help sell the movie when
she's probably not in it or not in a substantial

98
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,680
role. And the same for Chris Evans as Captain
America, when him and Bucky were, you know,

99
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:28,700
exchanging glances. Yeah. And all this doesn't
really feel like a new piece of marketing and so

100
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:34,520
much as kind of like a hash together, last pushed by
tickets of which I have. I have my tickets. I'm

101
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,480
going to go see it at the LMO on May 2nd, and I'm
really looking forward to it. I don't have my

102
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,440
tickets yet. Better fix that shit. Yeah. I'll
probably get them at the last minute. The film

103
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,200
isn't tracking too well, I think. So I expected to
do something like Brave New World numbers. I don't

104
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,580
think it'll be too hard to get tickets. Well, when
the movie turns out to be a masterpiece, since, you

105
00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:00,340
know, a lot of the A24 film production people are on
this movie, I think you're going to be sorry when

106
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,280
you're not able to get tickets because everybody
else is so excited to see the film. Yeah, I'll take

107
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:10,580
my chances. All right. I mean, this trailer didn't
get me too excited to rush out and buy my tickets.

108
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,760
What was your favorite part of the trailer? I like
the shot where we see Yelena going into the void. I

109
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,780
think that seems like the climax of the film. Yeah,
I could see that. But again, you know, we know what

110
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:25,120
happens or at least you know, I think we're pretty
confident we know what happens after she goes into

111
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,300
there. You think Yelena appeals to the centuries
darker nature or something like that? Something

112
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:37,640
like that, exactly. She's like, hey, I'm dark,
too, but I follow the light. I hope that doesn't

113
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:44,120
happen. My favorite part of the trailer had to be
when Bucky was talking with some side piece on the

114
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:48,040
phone and she was like, oh, we're not going to come.
And he's like, we could be the ones that are coming.

115
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:54,060
And I was like, oh, that's a bold swing. I hope that
pays off for him. Rumors are that's Songbird on the

116
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,780
other line. Who is a major Thunderbolts character
from the comic books? We did a Duel episode with

117
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:03,320
Songbird against DC's Pied Piper. So if you're
interested in learning more about her,

118
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,840
definitely check that out. Nice. Yeah, she's a
traditional Thunderbolt. So I'm glad they found a

119
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:12,100
way to squeeze her into the film if that is her.
Yeah, for sure. Let's go ahead and move on to the

120
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,060
Fantastic Four trailer, though, because I think
there's a lot more to say about that one.

121
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,260
Considering it's the best look we've gotten at the
film since the teaser came out, you know, a few

122
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:25,960
months ago. The trailer starts off with the host of
the Ted Gilbert show. And now it's seeing the

123
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:31,100
Fantastic Four as a team of astronauts who got
superpowers and are now celebrities. It's kind of

124
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,060
like the Ed Sullivan show. It looks like back in the
60s. I got to say, I'm loving the production design

125
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:42,140
on this film. I think it's a bold, creative choice
to set this movie in the time period that it is.

126
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:48,500
Because not only is it new for Marvel Studios, it
also makes it feel very Jack Kirby-esque. You

127
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,100
know, the artist who worked with Stanley to create
the Fantastic Four. And it feels just plucked

128
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:57,660
right out of that timeline. Oh, yeah, I totally get
those vibes. The Jack Kirby retrofuturism.

129
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:03,180
Absolutely. Yeah, it kind of lends this innocent,
happy tone to the film that I don't think you

130
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:09,100
necessarily would get if the movie was set in the
main MCU in the modern day. Things like, you know,

131
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:15,380
the kids asking the thing to pick up the car seems so
wholesome, you know, back in the 60s. Whereas

132
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:19,240
today, you know, you have a bunch of cynical
assholes would probably be like, oh, that's

133
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,700
cheesy. Yeah, today you have heroes like the
Thunderbolts who are dripping with cynicism

134
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:28,160
compared to the Fantastic Four. Right. Yeah. So
it's kind of cool that we're going to get that

135
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,600
dichotomy this summer from Marvel in the
theaters. We get a scene of Fantastic Four during

136
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,440
dinnertime, during which Sue and Reed show up late
and the thing correctly deduces that she is

137
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:44,780
pregnant. And Johnny gets super excited. This is
our first real look at Joseph Quinn's portrayal of

138
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,460
the Johnny Storm character. And I got to say, I like
it. I think it's pretty well done. Yeah, Joseph

139
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:54,140
Quinn is a great actor. I really liked him in
Stranger Things. So I was pretty excited when he

140
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:59,900
was cast for Johnny. I'm actually really liking
the entire cast, except again for Ben Grimm's

141
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:05,420
voice. Still not loving that. But the other
performances seem great. Yeah, I still wish that

142
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:10,020
the thing's voice was a little bit deeper, a little
bit more gravelly. But we'll see. One thing that I

143
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:15,640
do hope changes between now and the release date is
the special effects on Silver Surfer. They

144
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:21,980
weren't terrible, but I was hoping for a little bit
more definition in the character. She's pretty

145
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:28,080
low res right now, I would say. I want to say she's
low res, but I will say she's low articulation, if

146
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,580
that makes sense. If we're talking about like
action figures, this is more of like a Barbie than

147
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:40,440
like a McFarland, you know? Yeah, absolutely. I
don't mind the look. I still really question why

148
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:46,080
they decided to go with the shawla ball version of
Silver Surfer, who was a female version of the

149
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,940
character as portrayed in the Earth X mini series,
which is one of my favorite stories of all time. And

150
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,380
I know that they're trying to establish this movie
as set in an alternate universe. But considering,

151
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,340
you know, Galactus seems to be portrayed as we
traditionally know him, this female server

152
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:06,940
server really stands out as like the only thing
other than the time period that is setting this

153
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,520
film apart as an alternate universe story. And
because of that, I think she stands out like a sore

154
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:17,040
thumb. She should have been Frankie Ray, Nova, the
other Herald of Galactus after Silver Surfer in

155
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:22,560
the comics. I completely agree. Frankie Ray was
the character from the comics who used to be Johnny

156
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,440
Storm's girlfriend. And she was actually the, I
want to say niece of Phineas Horton, who created

157
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:33,160
the original Android Human Torch. She was exposed
to those chemicals. And so she had flame powers and

158
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:38,000
she was turned into a Herald of Galactus and she was
given the golden skin as opposed to silver like the

159
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,740
Silver Surfer. It would have been a great
spectacle to see on the screen. And they still

160
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,160
could have treated this as an alternate universe
story. We still could have saved the Noran Red

161
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:51,800
Silver Surfer for the primary Marvel timeline.
It's just it's strange why they chose to go with

162
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,180
Shawla Ball. I also think that Julia Garner could
have made a great Frankie Ray. Oh, yeah, she would

163
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,600
have been perfect for the role. There was a shot
here that was a little bit too reminiscent of the

164
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,840
rise of the Silver Surfer film where we saw Johnny
Storm chase the Silver Surfer out into space and

165
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:11,140
then get knocked back down to earth. I really hope
this story doesn't hit too many of those same beats

166
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:17,300
that that 2007 movie did. I do have to say I love what
they're doing with the characters in this film. It

167
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:24,360
seems so much better than the past films. Like Reed
Richards, dramatic arc, his internal conflict is

168
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:30,600
very apparent in this trailer. I think Pedro
Pascal is going to do an amazing job in the role. The

169
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,860
guilt that he feels over possibly bringing
attention to earth and possibly leading to its

170
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:42,980
destruction from Galactus is a fantastic story
beat for the character. They seem to be making so

171
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:47,400
many cool choices, like with a fantastic car, the
way their powers are portrayed are pretty cool,

172
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,520
including Mr. Fantastic, who he's got to see
stretch for the first time here. And Galactus

173
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:57,140
looks like he's going to be phenomenal. Oh, yeah,
the invisibility powers that we got to see for a Sue

174
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:02,960
Storms character that looked so damn cool. Yeah,
it was like a prism, kind of like bending light

175
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:08,020
where you get that kind of rainbow aura at the edge.
Yeah, I liked how only parts of her were like

176
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:13,280
turning invisible. She was definitely strained,
but it looked like she was bending light. So cool.

177
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,580
I'm really looking forward to this, but I got to say
Marvel is not too late to just redo the special

178
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:23,980
effects around your Shala Ball Silver Surfer as
Frankie Ray, the Herald called Nova. It probably

179
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:33,560
is too late. It's not too late, but that brings us to
our question of the week. What do you think of the

180
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:38,940
Shala Ball Silver Surfer from the Fantastic Four
First Steps official trailer? So similar to how we

181
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:43,680
asked you guys about the most controversial
element of the latest Superman preview we saw,

182
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,400
where we asked you guys what you thought about
crypto. Now we're asking your thoughts about the

188
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:20,060
got a release date for Sandman Season 2, which is
coming out later this year. In two parts. It came

189
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:26,599
with a brief teaser trailer. They're calling it a
date announcement in which we get to see all of the

190
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:33,700
members of the Endless, well, six of the seven at
least, which I've been dying to see. Like ever

191
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:39,800
since I started reading the Sandman comics and
dreamed of this being adapted on screen, like the

192
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:45,600
Endless are the coolest characters ever. And so to
see them all together kind of blew my mind and

193
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,180
totally has me pumped for this upcoming season.
Yeah, let me see if I can name them all real quick,

194
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,880
being someone who's never read the Sandman
series. I know there was Destiny at the beginning

195
00:17:53,880 --> 00:18:01,240
of the trailer. Of course, there is his sister
Death and Dream. And of course, we saw Desire and

196
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,540
Despair from the previous season. I think the new
one that we're seeing here, step out of the

197
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:11,420
painting is Delirium, but I'm not clear who the
missing seventh member is. So the missing seventh

198
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:19,200
member is Destruction, and he is the embodiment of
change as a word, sort of in the same way that Shiva

199
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:26,560
is the embodiment of destruction and change and
Hinduism. OK, now Delirium is a fan favorite

200
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:33,300
character. She actually started off as Delight,
but over the eons, she morphed into Delirium

201
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:39,060
because she was kind of a cosmic afterthought, as
it were. So she's this very tragic figure, someone

202
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:44,920
who's all powerful, but also insane, though she
wasn't always. I'm really curious to see what they

203
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,500
do with her character and with all of the endless,
honestly. You know, we got to see characters like

204
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:56,220
Death and Despair and Desire in the first season,
but they get more heavily involved in Dream's

205
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:01,880
story in these subsequent volumes. So yeah,
things are going to get good. Now, this season is

206
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:09,940
going to be 11 episodes total, the first six of
which will be released July 3rd, and the second

207
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:16,120
volume or the second half will be premiering July
24th, and that's five episodes. Now, we know that

208
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,700
this series has been Warner Brothers' most
expensive television series to date. Oh, and you

209
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:27,800
could definitely tell. Yes. For sure. Everything
looks incredible from the costuming to the set

210
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,720
design. The visual effects are incredible.
Everything. Everything is incredible. I really

211
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,700
enjoyed the first season of the show with the
exception of a few acting performances. I'm

212
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:44,480
really hoping season two tops that. I imagine it
will just because of the story and all the

213
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,560
different characters that we'll get to meet,
including Kay, Thor. Did you see that? Oh, is that

214
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:56,120
who that guy was? Yeah. What a poser. Sandman Thor,
way better than Marvel Thor. You'll find out. I

215
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:00,680
immediately and strongly disagree with that
statement. I recently canceled my Netflix

216
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:06,900
subscription, but I'm definitely going to get
back for this series because it may just be my

217
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:12,900
favorite series of all time. OK, calm down. Calm
down. It might suck. You never know. Dude, did you

218
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:18,420
see the footage? Did you see the footage? I did. I
know that a good trailer does not make a good

219
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:24,340
series. Now, we should address the elephant in the
room. Has the news about author Neil Gaiman's

220
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:30,380
general shittiness affected your anticipation
of this season? No, I could give two shits about

221
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:36,840
Neil Gaiman. Not going to lie. To me, it's all about
the art, not the artist. I understand sometimes

222
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,720
that people don't want to engage with the art
because they feel like they're supporting the

223
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,320
artist. But at the end of the day, I grew up reading
this series and there's no way I'm skipping out on

224
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,320
this. Yeah, I think at some point you got to say,
fuck them. What they created belongs more now to

225
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,600
the fan base. Well, in the case of the Sandman
universe, almost that exactly because other

226
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:02,680
creators have picked up where he left off and
created an entire Sandman universe. This is why

227
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:16,000
you don't want to meet your heroes, kids, because
everyone sucks. DC High Volume, Batman, the Dark

228
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:25,260
Knight's definitive DC comic stories adapted
directly for audio for the very first time. Fear. I

229
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:32,320
have to make them afraid. He's got a motorcycle.
Get after him or have you shot? You mean blow up the

230
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:40,000
building? From this moment on, none of you are
safe. New episodes every Wednesday, wherever you

231
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,500
get your podcasts. But that does it for the news
portion of this episode. Now let's go ahead and

232
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:53,000
move on to the main event where we review the Disney
Plus and Marvel Studios television series

233
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:14,160
Daredevil, born again season one. OK, Daredevil,
Born Again is a nine episode Disney Plus

234
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:20,000
television series run by Dario Skardapane and
starring Charlie Cox and Vincent D'Onofrio. The

235
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,940
show is a direct continuation of the three season
Daredevil Netflix series, which is largely

236
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:30,100
considered one of the best, if not the best,
superhero television series of all time. I

237
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,020
personally rated each of the first three seasons
of the Netflix show as no less than four and a half

238
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:39,800
out of five stars, including season three, which I
gave a perfect five star rating. I think the big

239
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:45,860
question in fans minds was was this new show going
to compare to what came before? And there's a whole

240
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:51,120
lot to talk about in regards to that. So if you
haven't seen the show, I'm going to say I recommend

241
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:57,020
seeing it. Go ahead and watch it before listening
to our spoiler breakdown of this season. In fact,

242
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:03,440
go watch all three seasons of the Netflix show if
you haven't before and then watch Born Again.

243
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,620
Right, because we'll be discussing spoilers from
those seasons as well. And honestly, those

244
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,220
seasons are masterpieces for the most part.
They're worth it. I'm not going to say they're the

245
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:17,300
best superhero television series ever, but it's
definitely the best Marvel series ever. The best

246
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,440
superhero television series of all time. Yes, I
think we were all hoping after the Netflix deal

247
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,660
with Marvel ended that somehow, somewhere, some
way we'd get to see these characters again.

248
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,540
Thankfully, it wasn't too long before we got the
news that the series rights were coming back to

249
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:35,460
Marvel and that they were continuing the show. And
then, you know, they cameoed Charlie Cox as Matt

250
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:41,040
Murdock in projects like Spider-Man, No Way Home
and She-Hulk, Attorney at Law, Season One. And

251
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:46,500
then we also got to see Kingpin show up in shows like
Hawkeye and Echo. When they first announced the

252
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:52,860
new season as Daredevil Born Again, I understood
from a branding standpoint why they would call it

253
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:57,960
that, considering the show was being retooled
under a new streaming service. But at the time of

254
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,400
that announcement, I did object to that name
because, you know, we've already seen Daredevil

255
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,720
Born Again adapted masterfully in season three of
the Netflix show, born again being, you know, the

256
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,200
name of a story arc from the comic books. I was
concerned that the show runners were going to try

257
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,880
to retread old ground with the story of Matt
rebuilding himself from rock bottom. But despite

258
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,520
the season's subtitle, the show instead chose the
interesting angle of adapting the Mayor Fisk

259
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,720
storyline from the comics, which I thought was
fascinating, because in this take, both of the

260
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,860
main characters spend a majority of the season
trying to be something they're not. You know, Matt

261
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:39,540
tries to be just a lawyer, not a vigilante. Fisk
tries to go straight and just be a mayor, not some

262
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:44,140
crime boss. But each one over the course of the show
is fooling themselves. And as the episodes go on,

263
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:49,800
they slowly are reborn into their chur selves. So
Daredevil Born Again as the title works both in

264
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:54,840
terms of branding and in tailoring this
adaptation to that brand. Yeah, it's kind of like

265
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,840
Spider-Man Homecoming in that I think it was
Marvel Studios kind of claiming ownership of that

266
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:05,040
character and the story that they were going to
tell. Yeah, we know that the initial approach to

267
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:10,160
the show is to actually ignore the three seasons
that came before and treat it as its own thing. And

268
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:14,900
then during the actor and writer strikes, they
realized that that was the wrong way to go. Dario

269
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:20,680
Scarpina, who worked on the Punisher Netflix
show, came aboard and reworked the show so that

270
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:25,280
they retained the continuity from the Netflix
show, which all the fans loved. Yeah, the show kind

271
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:30,340
of went through development hell. They've been
going so far as to rewrite and reshoot the entire

272
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:36,580
season, scrap everything they had so far. I was
worried that that was going to be evident in this

273
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:44,140
season and it was. But that's not saying that I
thought the season was bad. I think the worst thing

274
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:51,220
you could say about the season is that it's the
worst season of Daredevil. But that's not saying a

275
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:56,180
lot just because the other three seasons were
amazing. And this one was still good. I would

276
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:01,960
agree. Yeah, the season overall had somewhat of a
tonal disparity that was definitely a product of

277
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,700
the production issues it had. But somehow, you
know, they still produced a show that was at the

278
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:11,420
very least comparable to the Netflix series,
right? Like it maybe didn't reach those heights,

279
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:15,300
but pretty damn close. And that's pretty
commendable, considering what they went through

280
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:21,460
while making it. I feel like if they had another
episode or two, it absolutely would have been even

281
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:27,440
more comparable to what we got with Netflix
because they definitely left me wanting more this

282
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,560
season. Yeah. Now, the Mayor Fisk storyline from
the comics was fascinating because Fisk becoming

283
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:37,500
the mayor essentially had Daredevil retreat from
his vigilante persona because Fisk owned the

284
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:42,200
police and the courts. In the comics, it forced
Matt as the then assistant and district attorney

285
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,840
to take a much more political approach to bringing
down the kingpin. It was a very political story

286
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,960
where after a failed assassination attempt on
Fisk, Matt used special constitutional

287
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:57,180
emergency powers to seize some control from the
kingpin and restore order to New York. And that

288
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:01,900
leads to the devil's rain storyline. Now, this
shows adaptation of that story took a much less

289
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,500
political approach to the mayor Fisk arc, which I
think is a good thing because the political

290
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:11,320
aspects of Daredevil board again, I think were
fairly slow and uninteresting. Like I really

291
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,780
couldn't care less about Fisk being labeled a
union buster in the press. And then like, you know,

292
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:21,140
the intern guy has to give a heartfelt apology for
it and stuff like that. I was like, let's keep

293
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:26,940
things moving. As decent an actor, I think James
Gandolfini's son, I can't remember his name was. I

294
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:34,080
just think his character was a little bit
unnecessary. I kind of saw him as being the son that

295
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,320
the kingpin never had. You know, we just got done
seeing kingpin in the Echo series where he tried to

296
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:47,040
mentor Echo and have that child that he never had.
But this young guy on his political team ended up

297
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:53,120
being much more of a natural surrogate. I guess it
was good to get the perspective of people who did

298
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,160
support Fisk, which is why I think it was also
important to include those like documentary

299
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:01,840
style shots of the people of New York, you know,
giving their say. That was really interesting.

300
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,380
That was something that they did here that they
didn't do in the Netflix show. And I thought it

301
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:12,240
brought a vital like New York element to the show. I
loved those moments from BB Yurick. Those were

302
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,820
really well crafted. They felt like they were
real, right, which kind of made the whole show feel

303
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,760
like it was a little bit more real. It's an
interesting technique that I've seen before in

304
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:29,260
films, like when Harry met Sally or something like
that, just real people telling real stories. I

305
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:35,280
thought it really nailed the New York aspect of the
show, which is important in a daredevil show. I

306
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:40,060
thought it was like a good analog for real life, you
know, when you see interviews and surveys with

307
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:45,400
people who vote differently from you, you know,
it's it's so hard to conceive of someone who has a

308
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,860
different perspective. And then, yeah, you see
that there are actually people who think this way.

309
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,520
There are actually people who would vote for
kingpin because of the security provides

310
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:58,560
against, you know, some of the superhero related
tragedies that have befallen the city of New York.

311
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,680
In this adaptation of the mayor Fisk storyline, I
think the show took the more interesting approach

312
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,800
of having Matt and Kingpin find themselves after
their own respective tragedies, foggy's death

313
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,800
and getting shot by echo, forcing them to
reevaluate their lives. It was a good launching

314
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,160
point for the story. And I thought it was
believable that Fisk might run for mayor after

315
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:22,440
taking some time to reevaluate. And that Matt
would abandon Daredevil for a time. That being

316
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,480
said, you know, it's a little bit disappointing
that it takes two thirds of the season to get Matt

317
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,400
back to being Daredevil again. I know that
Daredevil season three had a similar buildup to

318
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:38,460
getting him back in the suit. Right. But that
season executed its pacing flawlessly in my mind.

319
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,760
Not so much with this born again season. And apart
from some pretty fucking brutal book and

320
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:49,200
episodes, born again as a whole felt a little bit
tamer than the Netflix show, both thematically

321
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,620
and in terms of the violence. Though I'll say that
this season did have the most violence he never,

322
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:58,040
which was like bordering on fucking horror film
levels of violence when Kingpin crushed

323
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:04,260
Commissioner Gallo's head. That was, I don't
know, unnecessary. Yeah, it felt like out of

324
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,460
place, right? I was like, this isn't the fucking
terrifier. Like you could have gotten away with

325
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:13,480
the gruesomeness using sound effects alone. Kind
of like how they did when Kingpin decapitated a guy

326
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:20,420
in the car door in Daredevil season one. You know,
right? They didn't show it explicitly, but we

327
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:25,600
still got every ounce of the impact. Absolutely. I
don't need to see Kingpin literally pulling a

328
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,660
guy's jaw off and like, you know, all the sinew and
stuff that comes when you tear it away. Like you

329
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,620
would think that someone in there at that point
would have been like, fuck, I think we're working

330
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:43,460
for the bad guy here. Shit. It's like, I'm out. I'm
out. That was that was that was a lot, bro. Beyond

331
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:48,460
the time it took for the characters to get back to
their roles and the tonal inconsistencies. I

332
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:53,220
think the most disappointing thing about born
again was that due to time constraints during

333
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:58,200
their period of retooling the show, they have the
number of episodes for season one, because season

334
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:05,780
one was initially going to be 18 episodes. Oh, wow.
That's way too many episodes. But now it's two

335
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:11,140
seasons of nine episodes. And then season two is
going to be eight episodes. So the final episode

336
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:16,380
here, you know, if it felt more like a mid season
finale than a proper season finale, that's

337
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:23,180
because it is in a way. And it doesn't quite seem
entirely fair to judge a story based solely on its

338
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:29,260
first half, but since that's how they chose to
release it, that's what we're left to do. And I will

339
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:35,360
say that with the disappointing feeling that I
felt with this quote unquote season finale, that

340
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,600
disappointment will be reflected in my final
rating of this season. Well, as it should be, like I

341
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:46,000
mentioned earlier, I definitely noticed the
production problems that this season had. In part

342
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,840
with the sudden cliffhanger drop off in this final
episode of the season, that was totally coming by

343
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:56,640
surprise, by the way. Like I was just waiting for
the next episode and I was like, wait, what? What?

344
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,440
And I guess it's not bad to leave your audience
wanting more. But I would have appreciated some

345
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,400
more catharsis. This feels very much like
Infinity War or the Empire Strikes Back, but

346
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:14,840
definitely not at the caliber of those projects.
Right. My least favorite thing wasn't the ending.

347
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:21,540
It was, like you mentioned, just some of the filler
moments, like the bank episode, I felt it was like

348
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:27,600
an entire filler episode. I loved that episode,
though. It was standalone, but I thought it was

349
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,320
like a perfect standalone that felt almost right
out of the comics. I could see that. I would have

350
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,200
rather skipped it. I didn't need it. There
definitely was a filler episode here, but it

351
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:40,880
wasn't that episode. Really? Yeah. I'll be
interested in hearing this. Well, that'll be in

352
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,760
our episode highlights. But before that, let's
get into our character breakdown. Starting with

353
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:50,760
Daredevil, aka Matt Murdock, played by Charlie
Cox. We've talked about Charlie Cox before on this

354
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,380
podcast. He's a flawless Daredevil in my mind. The
guy not only embodies the role, but I think

355
00:32:55,380 --> 00:33:00,540
transcends it with all the nuance he brings to his
performance. It's so great to have him back in the

356
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:04,620
role. You know, he had his cameos and other
projects, but I think where Matt Murdock really

357
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:10,360
shines is in the dichotomy between his charm as
Matt Murdock and his rage as Daredevil. And in

358
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:15,520
order to get that full character spread, you need
to see him on his own. As mentioned before, Matt was

359
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:19,520
on a journey back to being Daredevil after
retiring from the role because of the tragic loss

360
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:24,680
of his best friend, Foggy Nelson, and stepping
over his own personal ethical code in trying to

361
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:29,380
kill Bullseye for that. Over the course of the
episodes, we see him drift toward his vigilante

362
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:33,900
tendencies more and more, you know, starting with
a simple warning over a cup of coffee with a

363
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:38,840
kingpin. And then, you know, he ends up dusting off
his billy club and then he goes on to beat the shit

364
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:43,520
out of some people. And then eventually he dons the
suit once again. I think I've said multiple times

365
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,960
in this podcast's tenure that there's nothing
harder than sitting through a superhero project

366
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,400
watching the main character not want to be the hero
we know and love. I know I said that with the first

367
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,860
half of Luke Cage, season one, and I think I
definitely said it for She-Hulk, Attorney at Law.

368
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:02,420
And I'll say it again here, it was hard to get
through those episodes wanting to see him be

369
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:09,280
Daredevil again. Yeah, I definitely felt like
this was somewhat retread of season three. Like

370
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,960
you mentioned, where it kind of takes the whole
season for him to get back into costume. I agree. I

371
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:21,100
don't love that. I don't think it was as well done as
season three, but it would be really hard to match

372
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:26,239
that. They tried at least. Yeah, at least they
showed us that Matt really did want to be Daredevil

373
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,560
again and did a good job of putting him in
situations like the Bank Heist where he still got

374
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,219
to show off his powers, you know, just outside of
his Daredevil outfit. And I liked the Daredevil

375
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:40,760
outfit for this season. I thought it was a cool
texture upgrade. And I liked the new Billy Club,

376
00:34:40,760 --> 00:35:17,910
although it seems infinitely more dangerous than
the other Billy... I mean, Daredevil is good like

377
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:22,530
that. He's a marksman. He has his radar sense. I
don't think that's going to happen, but it does

378
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:27,890
seem needlessly lethal for a character who never
really goes that far. That said, his radar sense

379
00:35:27,890 --> 00:35:34,650
this season seemed different than in past
seasons. Like, he had a harder time focusing on

380
00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:41,090
multiple things at once. Like he'd be focusing on
one thing and miss something else entirely. That

381
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:45,930
happened multiple times this season. I think that
was more of a product of his rage, such as the Muse

382
00:35:45,930 --> 00:35:50,430
fight or something like that, than his actual
powers going funky. No, I don't think it was his

383
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:55,730
powers going funky. I just think it was a choice on
behalf of the creative team. Like he would be

384
00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:00,510
focusing on someone's footsteps so much that he
would almost get run over in the street and it's

385
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:04,970
like, oh, that's not the Daredevil I know. The
Daredevil I know has like a very keen spatial

386
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:10,590
awareness. It's his radar sense. I really did like
how the show, especially in the first episode, I

387
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:16,910
noticed used aspect ratio to try to portray what he
was focusing on. So like the letterbox format

388
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:22,150
would shift to almost full screen on some parts
where the audience got to hone in on exactly what

389
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:26,950
Matt was focusing on. It was very artistic and it's
not something that they did too much outside of

390
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:30,770
that first episode, unfortunately. It just
seemed to me more like they were focusing on his

391
00:36:30,770 --> 00:36:37,570
senses rather than this sixth radar sense that he
typically has. Well, I always kind of interpreted

392
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:44,590
his radar sense as the internal image he gets from
all the sensory data that comes into him. Yes, like

393
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:50,330
echolocation. Yeah. And in season one of
Daredevil, they portrayed it very much like a city

394
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:55,110
on fire type thing, which I thought was really
cool. I really want them to go back to that. Yeah,

395
00:36:55,110 --> 00:37:00,230
that'd be cool to see again for sure. Let's go ahead
and move on to the kingpin, AKA Wilson Fisk played

396
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:05,470
by Vincent D'Onofrio. Just like Charlie Cox, it is
so nice to see Vincent D'Onofrio back in the role in

397
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:11,050
this main show and not just in cameos anymore. Like
his appearance in Hawkeye was lackluster and his

398
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:15,590
role in Echo was fine. And he was like the best thing
about Echo season one. But only in the Daredevil

399
00:37:15,590 --> 00:37:21,130
show do you truly get a feel for how sadistic and
terrifying the character is, I think. And really,

400
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:25,590
I think this is the most terrifying we've probably
ever seen him, especially in the last episode of

401
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:30,690
this season, when he had the whole face ripoff
thing and then his smile to Vanessa at the end when

402
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:35,610
they were having dinner together. It was like some
Hannibal Lecter type stuff. Like D'Onofrio was

403
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:40,470
really pulling from some of his creepier roles
that he's had in like the cell or something like

404
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:47,290
that. Oh, dude, like making Vanessa shoot her
former lover that she had when she thought he was

405
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:52,330
gone and dead. Yeah, that was trippy. Yeah, their
whole relationship got a lot more focused here

406
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:56,850
than I thought it would. But I was definitely along
for the ride. I like where they took it. Yeah, he had

407
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:01,870
a phenomenal arc this season, I thought. There was
an interesting note that they made this season. It

408
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:07,090
was really kind of almost a throwaway line that
Vanessa said in the final episode, episode nine,

409
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:12,990
that served to bridge the gap between the Netflix
show and Hawkeye. At the end of Daredevil Season

410
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:17,930
Three, I think we all assumed that Kingpin was
going to be locked up forever. But in this season,

411
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:23,030
we learned that he was acquitted by his defense
attorneys who painted the FBI, including people

412
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:28,850
like Agent Nadine, as corrupt. And if you go back
and watch Daredevil Season Three, it's just so

413
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:35,110
fucking tragic. Considering how cathartic the
end of that show was and how it really felt like Matt

414
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:41,130
and Agent Nadine got justice there. And it turns
out, yeah, they did it. No, Kingpin was acquitted

415
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:46,190
just like he always is. It was kind of bullshit.
Yeah, I could see that. But I also don't see any

416
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:50,990
other way around it, really. Well, yeah, the bad
guys always got to come back, right? And, you know,

417
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:56,670
they already established the fact that Kingpin
was not in jail from shows like Hawkeye and shows

418
00:38:56,670 --> 00:39:02,530
like Echo. Right. So I figured something went
wrong somewhere. I did think it was cool how

419
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:06,910
Vincent DeNafio bulked up over the episodes. I
don't know if he bulked up like physically or if it

420
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:12,390
was just the tailoring of his suits. But I did
notice upon his first reveal, I was like, oh, he's

421
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:16,510
skinnier. And they even mentioned that in the
show. Matt comments, you've lost weight and

422
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:21,770
everything. But by the end, dude was fucking
massive. So that was a really believable

423
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:25,850
transformation that I thought was pretty dope.
Apparently he was bulking up down in that secret

424
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:31,530
dungeon that he had. He definitely looked a lot
better and more dapper here than he had in shows

425
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:38,510
like Hawkeye and Echo. I loved DeNafio as Kingpin.
He's perfect in the role. Let's go ahead and move on

426
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:43,710
to the Punisher, a.k .a. Frank Castle, played by
John Berndthal. It was nice to see the Punisher

427
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:48,450
back. I still think that Berndthal is the most
compelling actor to play the character. I'm not

428
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:53,270
quite sure that they used Frank Castle as well as
they could have during this season. No. I was a

429
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:57,890
little underwhelmed by Matt and Frank's initial
meetup. I don't think it held a candle to any of

430
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:03,030
their interactions in Daredevil season two,
which were like Shakespearean in quality. I don't

431
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,790
know if I would go that far, but it was so much better
than what they did here. Yes, Shakespearean.

432
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:13,190
Okay. I was so glad that Punisher showed up again in
the final episode. That way we could see him get in

433
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:17,490
action scene with Daredevil. And we saw him
address the issue of the Punisher copycats, which

434
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:23,170
I was hoping was a thread that they wouldn't leave
dangling. Yeah, it's so relevant to the real

435
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:30,130
world. Would you have some cops and some authority
figures touting a Punisher logo as a symbol that

436
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:35,330
they aspire to? It's not great. No, I don't love
that. I've been wanting to get a Punisher tattoo

437
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:39,650
for the longest time. I have a Captain America
shield on one shoulder. I wanted to get a Punisher

438
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:43,670
skull on the other. It's kind of like that
dichotomy, the angel-devil shoulder kind of

439
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:49,030
motif. And I won't get a Punisher tattoo now
because I think it's been co-opted by people who

440
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:53,990
shouldn't be using it necessarily. I don't mind
gun enthusiasts using the Punisher logo, but I do

441
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:59,510
have a problem with law enforcement using it
because it's a symbol of a person who deals out

442
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:04,670
lethal justice because in part they've gone
insane and I just don't think it's a good look. I

443
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:09,970
hate when I see the Punisher skull with the thin
blue line. Yeah, I don't think anyone should be

444
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:15,330
using the Punisher logo, honestly. Some
positions in society should be held to a higher

445
00:41:15,330 --> 00:41:21,170
standard, I would say personally. And that
standard should not be the Punisher. Right, yeah.

446
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:25,070
He's an interesting character, one of Marvel's
most interesting characters in fact, but I don't

447
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:29,510
think he's necessarily an inspiring character.
Peacemaker! They should just get Peacemaker

448
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:36,530
logos. So much better. The irony of that
statement. I wonder if we'll see Punisher again in

449
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:40,870
Daredevil Season 2 or if we'll only see him again in
the special presentation that Marvel's working

450
00:41:40,870 --> 00:41:45,990
on. Either way, I hope we see what he does once he
escapes his cell as we saw him do in the

451
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:51,410
post-credits scene of the show. Dude, that was so
obvious. The cop who went to shake his hand is a

452
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:57,310
freaking idiot. Anthony was a big dum-dum for
sure. I kind of hope that we don't see the Punisher

453
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:03,330
in the following season of Born Again, just
because like you, I don't think he was really well

454
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:09,330
used here, which is surprising considering that
the Punisher showrunner came on board to the

455
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:14,810
writing team for this series. Yeah, well, I also
hope that he doesn't show up again in Season 2, not

456
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:18,990
because I don't want to see the character, but
because he's not really a team player. And so if you

457
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:24,090
have him teaming up with, you know, whether it be
the defenders or New York City's finest, I think it

458
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:29,030
would just be strange to see him be that kind of
person. He's more of a loner, you know? He was a

459
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:33,170
member of the Thunderbolts for a while in the
comics. He should have been in that movie. Yeah,

460
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:37,810
that was weird too, though. Let's go ahead and move
on to the character of Muse, aka Bastion Cooper,

461
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:42,370
who was played by Hunter Doohon. I'll say that I'm a
little bit conflicted with the characterization

462
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:48,770
of Muse in this series. On one hand, he ended up
being so much less mysterious than his comic book

463
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:54,270
counterpart, because in the comics, who he is
really isn't even human. Like, he has powers.

464
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:59,670
Like, he can absorb the sensory data in his close
proximity, which makes him hard to pinpoint. On

465
00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:05,170
the other hand, I'll admit that adapting him as
this sort of Banksy artist serial killer, who

466
00:43:05,170 --> 00:43:09,730
drains and paints with the blood of his victims was
pretty damn interesting. I didn't know anything

467
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:15,970
about the character of Muse from the comics. I
thought this character was pretty interesting in

468
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:22,530
this show, even though I felt like he kind of came
too little too late and then was gone by the time

469
00:43:22,530 --> 00:43:28,890
things got interesting. Well, according to the
rumors, Muse was originally going to be the main

470
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:34,690
bad guy of the season. And then the show got
retooled and he was kind of sidelined. And I really

471
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:39,030
think that the show could have used him in a couple
more episodes than they had him in, just to build up

472
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:44,970
that mystery, you know? The actor who played him, I
thought did a decent job, even though it was very

473
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:52,930
obvious that he was Muse. I don't know if you saw the
show Wednesday, but it was the same bad guy actor.

474
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:57,270
So right away when I saw him, I was like, okay, he's
the bad guy. Honestly, he didn't even register to

475
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:02,950
me at the book signing when we first saw the
character, until the recap of the previous

476
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:07,950
episodes at the start of each episode, I realized,
oh, it's this guy. I thought the element of

477
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:12,750
painting with your victim's blood after draining
it was a really interesting modus operandi that we

478
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:18,730
haven't seen or I personally haven't seen in a lot
of like thriller material like shows and movies,

479
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:24,090
conceptually evil Banksy. It just felt kind of
neat. Yeah, I wonder what Banksy thinks of this

480
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:30,010
series. He probably hates it. I did think that the
revelation that he was like a Taekwondo expert was

481
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:35,070
a little bit convenient. That's right. It was a
little bit ridiculous. Like they needed to give

482
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:39,890
some kind of rationale for why he could hold his own
in a fight against Daredevil, but just kind of like

483
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:45,770
shoehorn again. Oh, I'm a Taekwondo champion was
silly at best. It's like, sure you are, pal. Sure

484
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:50,730
you are. Let's move on to Bullseye, aka Benjamin
Pointexter, played by Wilson Bethel. I really

485
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:54,850
like Wilson Bethel. I thought he was a force of
nature in Daredevil Season 3, and I was so glad that

486
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:59,030
they brought him back for board again. I think he
was a little underutilized, just like Muse here,

487
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:05,190
but he absolutely gave us the best action scene of
the season, which ironically was in Episode 1.

488
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:10,250
Yeah, it was the action scene that kicked off the
series, basically. Wilson Bethel's Bullseye is

489
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:15,190
still, I think, one of the most terrifying
villains we've probably ever seen in a superhero

490
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:20,090
television series. Seeing him come back just
brought me chills. I didn't know he was going to be

491
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:26,930
in the series. And when he was, I kind of thought he
was dispatched a little too quickly. I'm glad they

492
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:31,970
brought him back and it was cool to see some of the
things he did. But yeah, I definitely needed more

493
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:37,510
Bullseye this season. Yeah, I think newcomers to
the Daredevil show who hadn't seen the Netflix

494
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:43,730
previous seasons, I don't think we're
adequately, probably convinced of how scary this

495
00:45:43,730 --> 00:45:48,950
character is based just on his showings in this
show. I mean, that first episode was incredible,

496
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:54,330
but I think you really have to see Daredevil Season
3 to get a grasp of the depth that has gone into this

497
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:59,550
character. I hope he comes back. I don't know where
the hell he went to in that last episode. Right? He

498
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:05,070
just disappeared. Yeah, I don't think he had any
reason to. He was trying to kill the kingpin for

499
00:46:05,070 --> 00:46:09,890
putting him into general population, but he
probably would have been fine killing Matt and

500
00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:15,030
Kingpin and Vanessa all in one go. But instead, he
missed a shot and then took off. It was strange.

501
00:46:15,030 --> 00:46:22,650
Yeah, seeing Kingpin go to Windows to look outside
after an assassination attempt from Bullseye, I

502
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:27,610
was like, yeah, that's not a smart move. Like
Bullseye will always hunt you down. Exactly. And

503
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:32,170
also, I don't think putting Bullseye in general
population was actually a threat to him. I feel

504
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:36,330
like he could have killed every other prisoner
that was there, considering he can turn anything

505
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:41,750
into a weapon pretty much. Yeah, absolutely. I'm
wondering why he didn't. I don't know. But that's

506
00:46:41,750 --> 00:46:51,630
it for the characters. Let's go ahead and move into

514
00:47:38,510 --> 00:47:43,150
Episode 1 was called Heaven's Half Hour. While
celebrating the retirement of their NYPD

515
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:47,450
associate, Cherry, Matt Murdock, and his friends
are attacked by Bullseye, who shoots and kills

516
00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:53,030
Foggy Nelson. In retaliation, Daredevil drops
the villain off a roof, an act seen by Cherry, who

517
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:57,890
learns that Matt is Daredevil. One year later,
Matt has retired as the hero and works at a new law

518
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:03,050
firm started with former DEA Kirsten McDuffie,
who sets him up with her friend Heather Glenn, a

519
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:07,770
therapist. Kingpin returns to New York after
spending time away recovering from being shot and

520
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:12,450
nearly killed. He has his wife Vanessa step away
from leading New York's crime in his stead and

521
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:17,910
announces his candidacy for mayor, running on an
anti-crime and anti-vigilante platform. Matt

522
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:22,770
and Fisk meet at a diner, warning each other to stay
in line. Seen as a tough and capable candidate by

523
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:27,710
the people of New York, Fisk wins the election for
mayor. He admits to Vanessa that he knows of the

524
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:32,430
affair she had with a man named Adam during his
absence. As the city celebrates, a graffiti

525
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:37,690
artist paints a mural of Fisk. To me, this was the
best episode. I always hate when that happens,

526
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:41,830
when the first episode was the best, but I don't
regret this one because I had such a good time

527
00:48:41,830 --> 00:48:48,050
watching it. It really felt cathartic, you know,
getting the show that you know and love back and

528
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:52,770
just as good as you remember it. By the time those
opening credits rolled, after we saw Daredevil

529
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:58,290
throw Bullseye off the building after hearing
Foggy's heart stop and he tossed his helmet down

530
00:48:58,290 --> 00:49:03,250
with all those blades sticking out of him, I was
floored. My jaw was on the ground and I was just able

531
00:49:03,250 --> 00:49:08,030
to just like absorb that new opening credit scene
with a riff on the classic Daredevil theme, you

532
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:13,810
know, it was fantastic. I really wish the internet
wasn't so quick to spoil things for people. Like

533
00:49:13,810 --> 00:49:18,250
right after the episode dropped, I learned that
Foggy Nielsen was going to die in the first

534
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:24,530
episode. And so it kind of ruined the whole opening
kind of bit for me. That's horrible. Well, you

535
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:28,130
still said you didn't know Bullseye was going to
show up, so you were surprised by that. That's

536
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:34,250
fair. Yeah, I was surprised by Bullseye, not by the
outcome of what happened, though. It was a cool

537
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:38,770
fight, though. I love how it was that, you know,
single tracking shot that the Daredevil series is

538
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:43,450
known for, where we got to see Daredevil and
Bullseye fight outside of Josie's Bar, come into

539
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:47,990
Josie's Bar, go up the stairwell, and then onto the
roof. The fight choreography was just

540
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:54,030
phenomenal. And seeing Bullseye like murder so
many people in the course of that fight, yeah, it

541
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:58,810
was horrifying. And also seeing Bullseye like
smack the pavement the way he did, I totally

542
00:49:58,810 --> 00:50:03,750
thought they killed off the character. Me too. In
regards to some of the side characters, I don't

543
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:08,770
think Kirsten McDuffie was nearly as compelling
in the show as she is in the comics. She's a more fun

544
00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:13,130
character in the comics, I think, a little more
witty. But I've never liked Heather Glenn,

545
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:16,670
whether it was in the comic books or in the show,
especially in the show, though, that she was a

546
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:21,230
waste of a character. You know, she actually
showed up in the 2003 Daredevil movie with Ben

547
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:26,790
Affleck. She was the one that left the voicemail on
his phone, breaking up with him, saying he was too

548
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:31,930
distant. That was Heather. Same character.
Interesting. In the book, she was like a socialite

549
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:36,810
heiress, if I remember correctly. Episode two was
called Optics. Hector Eliyat comes across two men

550
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:41,510
beating up another on a subway platform and tries
to stop them when one of the aggressors is hit by a

551
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:46,250
train and the other reveals themselves as a cop.
Matt overhears Hector's story and volunteers to

552
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:51,030
defend him against his murder charge. Charyon
covers that Hector is the vigilante known as White

553
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:56,050
Tiger. Information which Matt requests be held
from the trial, believing that a history of

554
00:50:56,050 --> 00:51:00,530
violence would bias the jury. Fisk Blackmail's
New York Police Commissioner Gallo to prevent him

555
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:04,810
from resigning in protest of his election.
Heather begins counseling Kingpin and Vanessa's

556
00:51:04,810 --> 00:51:09,770
marriage. Matt tracks down the subway platform
victim named Torres to get him to testify against

557
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:15,830
the cops, but he's interrupted by officers with
Punisher Skull Tattoos who attempt to attack him.

558
00:51:15,830 --> 00:51:20,650
Matt savagely beats them in response when that's
the end of the episode. What did you think of White

559
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:25,650
Tiger in this series? I thought it was cool. I
thought his costume could use some work, although

560
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:33,990
he's kind of depicted as a homegrown type of
superhero. I thought it was canonically supposed

561
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:38,810
to be made out of jade. I don't know what it was made
out of here. It looked like silver, but I wish I

562
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:45,010
could have seen more of White Tiger in action in his
costume. Like we saw some like footage of it on the

563
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:52,050
BB Eurek report, but you know his ability is to be
three times the martial artist, three times the

564
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:57,130
strength, you know, three times the skill due to
the three pieces of the jade amulets. I think it

565
00:51:57,130 --> 00:52:01,090
would have been cool to see that in action. Yeah,
that's what I was going to say. I would have loved to

566
00:52:01,090 --> 00:52:06,830
have seen White Tiger in action. It was kind of
weird to hear Matt Murdock and everyone talking

567
00:52:06,830 --> 00:52:12,750
about this amulet that he had that gives him like
superhuman powers. I was like, this is kind of

568
00:52:12,750 --> 00:52:17,950
different from the more grounded Netflix shows
when they're talking about superpowers. Right.

569
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:21,770
Yeah. I mean, the fact that they're setting it more
in the MCU kind of got to give him a little bit more of

570
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:25,870
that leeway. But the fact that like the amulet
wasn't taken by the Department of Damage Control

571
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:30,690
or something like that, like his positions were
returned to his next of kin. You know, his niece,

572
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:35,370
Angela was in the show and she becomes his
successor as the White Tiger. This whole

573
00:52:35,370 --> 00:52:40,370
storyline almost played exactly like how it did in
the comic books where he was framed for a murder of a

574
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:45,950
cop and Matt defends him, gets him acquitted, and
then White Tiger is shot and killed right after

575
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:50,830
leading to Angela taking up the mantle. Although
in this show, Angela is a lot younger. Yeah, I was

576
00:52:50,830 --> 00:52:55,610
about to say she was way too short to be a superhero.
Yeah. She's not my favorite version of the White

577
00:52:55,610 --> 00:53:00,330
Tiger, though. That's Eva Hector's sister. You
can learn more about White Tiger in our Dula

578
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:05,590
episode where we pit her against Bronze Tiger. I
want to say RIP to Kamar Dulos Reyes, the actor who

579
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:12,950
played White Tiger. He died in December 2023 from
cancer. Oh, no way. What? Yeah. He dedicated a few

580
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:17,770
episodes to him. I didn't make that connection. So
we've on to episode three, the hollow of his hand

581
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:21,970
with Kingpin stepping away from crime, the gang
leaders Victor and Luca start turning on each

582
00:53:21,970 --> 00:53:27,050
other. Vanessa frustrated that her work is being
undone as Kingpin's right hand man Cashman

583
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:32,490
ordered Luca to pay Victor 1.8 million in
restitution. In court, the victim Taurus

584
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:38,010
declines to testify on Hector's behalf at a fear of
police retaliation, causing Matt to reveal his

585
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:42,850
client's White Tiger identity, focusing on
testimony from the people he saved over the years.

586
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:47,590
The jury finds Hector not guilty, which angers
Fisk due to his anti-vigilante stance. Despite

587
00:53:47,590 --> 00:53:51,950
Matt warning him to lay low after being
exonerated, Hector dons his White Tiger costume

588
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:57,170
and is shot dead by a man wearing the Punisher
symbol. I thought this was a great legal episode. I

589
00:53:57,170 --> 00:54:01,270
always like seeing the legal cases that Matt takes
on play out in the courts. It's one of the unique

590
00:54:01,270 --> 00:54:05,750
aspects of the Daredevil comic and these
Daredevil shows. And also, you know, the She-Hulk

591
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:10,590
shows, which you know how I felt about that show in
our review. But I always like a good legal drama.

592
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:15,070
And I thought that played out pretty well here.
Yeah, it played out as one of the better trials that

593
00:54:15,070 --> 00:54:20,990
have been in the entire series. I agree. And the
ending was sufficiently tragic. When I saw the

594
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:26,950
Punisher skull, I was like, that wasn't Frank. So I
knew that they were kind of going to address the

595
00:54:26,950 --> 00:54:31,950
police idolatry of the character of Punisher,
that whole theme within the course of this show,

596
00:54:31,950 --> 00:54:36,750
which I was really looking forward to. I actually
thought the mystery of who shot White Tiger was

597
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:42,210
going to be the main focus of the show. It was kind of
weird when they were deviating with subplots

598
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:47,170
after that. Yeah, it was kind of pushed off to the
side, which is unfortunate, especially for the

599
00:54:47,170 --> 00:54:52,450
character of White Tiger. And I wasn't thrilled by
the reveal that it was Cole North, who in this show

600
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:57,450
was a member of the anti-vigilante task force. But
in the comic books, he's actually a police

601
00:54:57,450 --> 00:55:01,990
detective. It's more like the character of Cherry
within this show, except more of a badass because

602
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:07,290
he can fight. It was very against the type of
character that he is in the comic books. In the

603
00:55:07,290 --> 00:55:11,830
comic books, he's more of a hero. Yeah, the reveal
that he was the killer was so anti-cli-backed. I

604
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:16,330
was like, come on, it was one of the things that kind
of made me feel that there was trouble going on

605
00:55:16,330 --> 00:55:21,920
behind the scenes story-wise. Yeah, maybe.
Episode 4 was called Six Semper Systema. Matt

606
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,010
comforts Hector's niece Angela, who believes the
cops killed her uncle. Kingpin and Vanessa

607
00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:30,850
discuss her affair with Adam in therapy. Matt
represents a man arrested for stealing caramel

608
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:35,870
corn. Fisk announces his plan to rebuild the
city's Red Hook port, which some suspect is a cover

609
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:41,330
to build up his future criminal endeavors. Matt
tracks the bullet casing used to kill Hector and

610
00:55:41,330 --> 00:55:45,950
sees the Punisher skull on it. He tracks down
Punisher to ask if he's Hector's killer and if not

611
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:51,370
to take responsibility for those misusing his
symbol. Frank calls Matt out on his anger and his

612
00:55:51,370 --> 00:55:56,490
failure to avenge Foggy. Matt contemplates the
Daredevil mantle while pulling his billy club out

613
00:55:56,490 --> 00:56:01,730
of storage as Fisk has dinner in a secret dungeon
where he's keeping Adam. I thought this was the

614
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:05,890
filler episode. A lot of it was just kind of
unimportant. You know, the biggest thing about

615
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:11,830
this episode was the Matt and Frank meetup, but
that was weak as hell. I just really didn't like how

616
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:16,350
that played out, because the way it ended, it
almost played like a scene from Good Will Hunting,

617
00:56:16,350 --> 00:56:21,490
where Frank was like, you're angry about Foggy's
death, ain't ya? Well, it's not your fault, Red.

618
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:26,670
It's not your fault. And Matt's like, don't fuck
with me, man. And then, you know, they share a cry.

619
00:56:26,670 --> 00:56:31,950
And I'm sitting over here like, what the fuck is
going on? Right, 100%. I was like, well, that's

620
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:39,890
unusually intuitive for Frank Castle. Right. The
whole caramel corn thing. What the fuck was that

621
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:44,150
about? It was supposed to be a commentary on
society, you know? It really hit home when the guy

622
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:48,670
was like, you know, the city's willing to pay five
times as much to have me incarcerated than to help

623
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:52,270
me eat. You know, it was really tragic hearing
about him, you know, digging through trash and

624
00:56:52,270 --> 00:56:56,810
stuff like that. And a lot of people are in this
vicious cycle. But, you know, that whole plot

625
00:56:56,810 --> 00:57:02,190
thread really never went anywhere. I don't know if
they were trying to go for like Stiltman in the

626
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:06,750
Netflix shows here. I think it would have been
better if they would have, because at least I would

627
00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:12,390
have cared a little bit more. Oh, you're talking
about Turk Barrett? Yes. Yeah, in the comic books,

628
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:16,490
he's Stiltman, but they never showed him in his
Stilts. They only referenced him in the old

629
00:57:16,490 --> 00:57:20,770
Netflix show. They should have made Turk come
back. I really like Turk. I thought he was a great

630
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:25,730
character in the old show. Moving on to episode
five, which was called With Interest. On St.

631
00:57:25,730 --> 00:57:30,330
Patrick's Day, Matt visits New York Mutual Bank to
seek out a loan for his firm, where he speaks with

632
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:35,870
assistant bank manager Yusuf Khan, the father of
Kamala Khan, the hero known as Ms. Marvel. During

633
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:40,130
their meeting, a group of bank robbers working for
Luca take everyone in the bank hostage, seeking

634
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:45,610
access to the vault to get the $1.8 million he needs
for his debt. The lead robber, Devlin, negotiates

635
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:50,970
with Detective Kim while Yusuf is taken to open the
vault. Matt subdues two of the robbers and opens

636
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:55,130
the vault where they find a rare diamond the
robbers were trying to get. Matt pretends to hand

637
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:59,490
over the diamond right as the police storm the bank
and rescue the hostages. Devlin disguises

638
00:57:59,490 --> 00:58:04,650
himself as a cop and escapes, believing he's in the
clear, but he's followed by Matt who beats the

639
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:09,270
ever-loving shit out of him. Matt secretly
returns the diamond to Yusuf at the bank. Like I

640
00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:13,830
said earlier, I liked this episode. I don't know if
you liked it as much as I did, but it felt like a story

641
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:18,450
that you'd get in between arcs in the comics, you
know? And I really like how cleverly it played out

642
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:23,130
where one of the hostages was on the inside with the
criminals and stuff like that. I thought it was

643
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:29,010
pretty well done and well executed. I just hated
how it really didn't play into the rest of the show.

644
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:33,690
One shots are cool. I don't think they're cool in
television series though. Yeah, I mean, like

645
00:58:33,690 --> 00:58:37,470
there was the major side plot between Victor and
Luca, the crime bosses, but they didn't really

646
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:43,410
focus on that too much. So it was weird to see it get
an entire episode dedicated to that subplot here.

647
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:48,910
You're right. But we got a really cool cameo from
Yusuf Khan, the father of Kamala Khan, which I

648
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:52,510
think was totally in keeping with the types of
cameos that you would see in the books. Yeah,

649
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:56,910
that's true. I thought the best part of this
episode though was the Irish joke. I mean, it was

650
00:58:56,910 --> 00:59:02,690
good. I think that was to pad the runtime a little
bit. 100%, but it was actually funny. Let's go to

651
00:59:02,690 --> 00:59:07,870
move on to episode six, Excessive Force. After her
body is discovered with its eyes gouged out, Luca

652
00:59:07,870 --> 00:59:12,590
visits Fisk, who tells him that he has a week to pay
his debt. A sanitation worker tells Fisk that the

653
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:18,050
murals around the city are painted by the
mysterious artist Muse using human blood. Angela

654
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:22,690
Diltoro visits Matt at his firm informing him that
her late uncle, White Tiger, was looking into

655
00:59:22,690 --> 00:59:26,930
finding a serial killer who was hiding in the
subway tunnels. Fisk meets with New York's elite

656
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:32,470
edda fundraiser, including Jack Duquesne, who
rejects his plans to build the Red Hook port. Fisk

657
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:37,810
puts together a vigilante task force of crooked
cops and grants them impunity to go after Muse.

658
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:42,610
Angela investigates Muse's location herself and
is taken as his next victim. Her family contacts

659
00:59:42,610 --> 00:59:47,350
Matt to report her missing, and he finally
redaunts his Daredevil suit to rescue her. He

660
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:51,690
fights and nearly kills Muse, but the villain
escapes as Daredevil tries to save Angela from

661
00:59:51,690 --> 00:59:56,770
bleeding out. Meanwhile, Fisk beats Adam in a
secret dungeon. I was not expecting to see

662
00:59:56,770 --> 01:00:02,250
swordsmen come back from the Hawkeye show. It was
really cool to see him here, and I hope that he joins

663
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:07,510
Daredevil's team in season two of Daredevil Born
Again. Yeah, I'm really curious to see who they

664
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:12,530
will put on that team. I was hoping they would kind
of hint at it, maybe with the cameo from the

665
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:16,710
defenders or something like that. But yeah, it
would be cool if he was a part of that team. He was

666
01:00:16,710 --> 01:00:21,350
captured with a punisher, maybe the punisher set
some free, I don't know. That'd be cool. Episode

667
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:25,690
seven is called Art for Art's Sake. Inna Angela
recovers in the hospital and tells authorities

668
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:30,430
the location of Muse's lair. Detective Kim tells
Fisk that the primary suspect of the Muse's

669
01:00:30,430 --> 01:00:35,110
identity is an artist and taekwondo expert,
Bastion Cooper, who happens to be one of Heather's

670
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:40,070
therapy patients. Luka meets with Vanessa, who
asks her to take back control of the mob behind

671
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:45,050
Fisk's back. Daredevil finds paintings of
Heather in Muse's lair and goes to her office where

672
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:50,230
Muse has her restrained and plans to kill her.
Daredevil rescues her and fights Muse, ending

673
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:55,050
with Heather shooting and killing the villain
before fainting from blood loss. Fisk has his task

674
01:00:55,050 --> 01:01:00,610
force take credit for taking down Muse and
rescuing Heather. Cashman kills Luka in a trap set

675
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:06,150
by Vanessa. I liked this episode. I thought the
fight between Muse and Daredevil was like hella

676
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:10,350
violent. A lot of blood spray, especially when
Daredevil shoots his billy club through him and

677
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:14,870
stuff like that. I thought it was an action packed
hero versus a villain fight. It was nice to see

678
01:01:14,870 --> 01:01:19,630
those two kind of clash together again after their
initial bout in the previous episode. Yeah, it was

679
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:25,470
a great superhero versus super villain battle. I
do really wish that the Muse arc was not just like a

680
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:29,850
two episode thing and that they really would have
established him more in earlier episodes. I did

681
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:35,470
think it was kind of convenient that he was
obsessed with Daredevil's girlfriend. But I also

682
01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:40,910
think that the whole therapy sessions between
Wilson Fisk, his wife and Daredevil's girlfriend

683
01:01:40,910 --> 01:01:47,690
was also very convenient, considering the fact
that I'm not entirely certain Wilson Fisk was

684
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:52,910
going to her to learn about Matt, like Matt
suspected. No, I think they were legitimately

685
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:57,310
trying to work on their marriage. But by the end of
this, when you know she becomes one of his cabinet

686
01:01:57,310 --> 01:02:02,470
members, I totally think it's going to be to get
information on Matt. Yeah, probably. Episode

687
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:06,750
eight was called Isle of Joy. In prison, Bullseye
gets moved from solitary to the general

688
01:02:06,750 --> 01:02:11,550
population. Kingpin reveals Adam's secret
prison to Vanessa who kills Adam to reconcile

689
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:16,130
their marriage. At Josie's bar, Matt deduces that
Foggy's death was an orchestrated hit by

690
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:21,210
Bullseye, not out of some vendetta. Matt visits
Bullseye in prison for information, but Bullseye

691
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:25,450
only agrees to talk on condition of his release,
resulting in Matt smashing his face into the

692
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:30,370
table. At a fundraiser ball, Kingpin begins
consolidating his power over the elites who

693
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:35,950
rejected his Red Hook Port Restoration. Bullseye
uses his broken tooth to escape prison and break

694
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:41,570
into the ball. Matt deduces that it was Vanessa who
ordered the hit on Foggy, not Kingpin. Matt then

695
01:02:41,570 --> 01:02:46,590
hears Bullseye's rifle about to shoot at Kingpin
and takes the bullet through the chest. I gotta say

696
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:51,210
Heather annoyed the shit out of me this episode. I
normally wouldn't comment on this, but I was that

697
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:56,410
annoyed. She tells Matt like, Daredevil didn't
save me. I saved me. Muse and Daredevil were there

698
01:02:56,410 --> 01:03:02,130
for themselves. It's like Chica. You were getting
sliced into with a scalpel when Daredevil

699
01:03:02,130 --> 01:03:08,870
arrived. He literally had Muse impaled when you
shot him. You didn't save shit, okay? Yeah, that

700
01:03:08,870 --> 01:03:14,170
was pretty ridiculous. I actually really liked
this episode. These last two episodes, I felt

701
01:03:14,170 --> 01:03:20,150
like, were what the show should have been from the
beginning. I thought they were really good. And I

702
01:03:20,150 --> 01:03:24,670
think a lot of it has to do with Bullseye. Again, the
character is just really cool and a great

703
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:30,110
Daredevil villain. Even though the end of this
episode was kind of ridiculous, I thought,

704
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:35,810
considering we already know that Wilson Fisk
wears bulletproof suits. And I'm pretty sure Matt

705
01:03:35,810 --> 01:03:39,190
knew that as well. I don't know if Bullseye knew
that though, because he obviously wasn't going

706
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:45,370
for a headshot for Kingpin. But if Matt knew that,
why did he take the bullet? Great question. Maybe

707
01:03:45,370 --> 01:03:49,990
he somehow knew that Fisk wasn't wearing a
bulletproof suit at this time. I guess maybe.

708
01:03:49,990 --> 01:03:54,150
Let's go ahead and move on to the final episode
called Straight to Hell. In a flashback to one year

709
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:58,230
earlier, Vanessa frees Bullseye from his
psychiatric facility in exchange for killing

710
01:03:58,230 --> 01:04:03,450
Foggy, who's working on a case involving the Red
Hook Port, where she launders her money. Back in

711
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:07,250
the present, Matt wakes up in hospital,
critically injured, but alive. Kingpin orders

712
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:11,490
New York City to be shut down in an effort to hunt
down his enemies, causing a city-wide power

713
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:16,710
outage, and orders Cashman to kill Matt in the
hospital. Matt escapes during the blackout and

714
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:20,450
heads home where he finds the Punisher ready to
assist him. Together, they fight off the

715
01:04:20,450 --> 01:04:25,410
anti-vigilante task force who break into Matt's
apartment, and they learn that one of the cops was

716
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:30,370
White Tiger's murderer. The pair argue about
Frank's lethal force, but jump out of the window to

717
01:04:30,370 --> 01:04:35,410
avoid a grenade. The pair are picked up by Karen
Page, who, along with Matt, learn in Foggy's files

718
01:04:35,410 --> 01:04:40,990
that the Red Hook Port is a historical free port
exempt from state and national jurisdiction, and

719
01:04:40,990 --> 01:04:45,310
that the Fisks are trying to create their own
city-state there. Punisher is captured after

720
01:04:45,310 --> 01:04:49,570
single-handedly trying to take down the
anti-vigilante task force cops, and denies their

721
01:04:49,570 --> 01:04:53,950
offer to join them. Kingpin learns of
Commissioner Gallo's attempt to undermine him,

722
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:58,770
and smashes and tears his face apart with his bare
hands in front of his force. He declares martial

723
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:03,670
law in New York, and Daredevil begins recruiting a
contingent of honest police and other dissidents

724
01:05:03,670 --> 01:05:08,770
to save the city. In a post-credits scene,
Punisher breaks the guards' arm to escape his

725
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:12,950
cell. I thought there were some great fanboy
moments here. Seeing Daredevil and Punisher team

726
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:18,670
up again, this time both of them in costume, was so
cool to see as a fan. Because they've teamed up

727
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:23,650
before in the Netflix shows, but never with them in
their outfits. There's just something really

728
01:05:23,650 --> 01:05:28,450
exciting about that as a fan. And it was so
well-written too. After they jump out of the

729
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:32,950
building to avoid the explosion, they land on the
car, and they get off, and Matt's like, you're an

730
01:05:32,950 --> 01:05:38,750
asshole, Frank. And Punisher's just like, I know.
It was just great fan service. Yeah, I was

731
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:46,390
wondering who was the friend that called Frank to
go help Matt. And when it was revealed to be Karen

732
01:05:46,390 --> 01:05:51,990
Page, I was like, oh, that's right. She was a big
part of Punisher Season 1. I totally forgot about

733
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:56,610
that connection. I'm so glad that they brought the
actors for Foggy Nelson and Karen Page back,

734
01:05:56,610 --> 01:06:01,070
because that would have been really weird to even
have the Punisher in the Daredevil show again

735
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:06,350
without that connection. Yeah, Deborah N. Wall is
fantastic. She was great in the Daredevil show.

736
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:10,450
She was great in the Punisher show. It was nice that
she served as the bridge between those two

737
01:06:10,450 --> 01:06:15,950
characters. And it just felt right that she would
be the one to kind of facilitate that team up. And I

738
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:20,070
really hope that she sticks around for Daredevil
Season 2, because I think she plays an important

739
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:24,250
role that I think was kind of missed in the course of
this season. There was a great emotional moment

740
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:28,910
between her and Matt at the end of this episode,
where Matt admits to Karen that after Foggy died,

741
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:33,890
he didn't know who he was anymore. And her
reassuring him that no matter what Foggy always

742
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:38,930
believed in him, I thought was just a great
springboard for this renewed sense of self going

743
01:06:38,930 --> 01:06:45,350
into Season 2 and taking the fight to the kingpin.
Right. Foggy would not have wanted him to give up

744
01:06:45,350 --> 01:06:51,250
pursuing justice the way he does. But that's the
end of the show. Overall, I think there was a lot to

745
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:55,630
enjoy here, especially as a fan of the Netflix
series. And while it didn't necessarily quite

746
01:06:55,630 --> 01:07:00,750
reach the heights of the Netflix series, when you
consider that the first episode and the last two

747
01:07:00,750 --> 01:07:06,270
episodes were the best of the season, I'm even more
hyped going into Daredevil Born Again Season 2,

748
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:11,470
which will come out next March. Like its namesake
character, the show rediscovers itself as it

749
01:07:11,470 --> 01:07:17,530
goes, resulting in an uneven, yes, but ultimately
comparable season to the Netflix series before

750
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:22,690
it. And I think that's the best thing you could say
about it. I'm giving it four out of five stars, a

751
01:07:22,690 --> 01:07:29,090
fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Although you'll
note that it is a lower rating than any of the other

752
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:34,050
Daredevil seasons that we've rated. Yeah, I said
it was the worst Daredevil season, but the other

753
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:39,430
ones were just so damn good. I feel like there was
inevitable, you know. The show started off really

754
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:45,290
strong and it ended really strong. And while I
didn't love a lot of the stuff in the middle, I'd

755
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:49,710
still recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the
Netflix shows. And I'm definitely looking

756
01:07:49,710 --> 01:07:55,790
forward to seeing what they bring next year.
Absolutely. My voice made it. I can't believe it

757
01:07:55,790 --> 01:08:00,090
for the most part. I think I'm definitely
struggling more than it was at the start of this

758
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:07,330
recording. So that does it for this review. AJ and
IK, help close this out. Thanks for listening to

764
01:08:36,649 --> 01:08:43,310

team duel between Watchmen and Thunderbolts. And

765
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:48,490
it looks like our Thunderbolts team is going to
skew pretty closely to the roster that's in the

movie. So you definitely want to check that out
before the movie hits theaters. That does it for

771
01:09:14,410 --> 01:09:20,850
podcast possible. We'll talk to you guys next
week. Up up and away, true believers. Fun fact,

772
01:09:20,850 --> 01:09:25,810
Daredevil gets all the ladies using his signature
pickup line, me so horny, and then pointing at his

773
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:26,850
horns. Look it up.
