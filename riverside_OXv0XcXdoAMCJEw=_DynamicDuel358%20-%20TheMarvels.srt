18
00:02:01,058 --> 00:02:05,221
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

19
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:10,365
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based

20
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:16,850
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother, Johnny DC. And in this episode,

21
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:23,936
we are going to review the latest Marvel Studios
film to hit theaters, The Marvels. It was a

22
00:02:23,976 --> 00:02:29,401
pretty, pretty good time, I thought. I liked
it. I liked the movie. I went in with no expectations.

23
00:02:30,602 --> 00:02:35,503
I was still underwhelmed. That makes you a hater,
because everybody literally felt the same way

24
00:02:35,523 --> 00:02:40,704
about the Flash movie and Blue Beetle, and if
you can't be fair to this movie when you gave

25
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:45,106
those movies like four and a half stars, that
makes you a piece of crap. Geez, you don't

26
00:02:45,126 --> 00:02:51,827
gotta say it like it is, Marge. Yeah, just saying
it as it is. We'll talk about the movie later

27
00:02:51,847 --> 00:02:55,128
on this episode. Before that, we're gonna break
down the latest comic book movie news to come

28
00:02:55,168 --> 00:03:02,131
out this past week, including the news that
Deadpool 3... Captain America 4, Blade, Thunderbolts,

29
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:06,914
and Venom 3 have all gotten new release dates,
and we're going to talk about the first official

30
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:11,997
teaser for the Dead Boy Detectives television
show. As always, we list our segment times

31

check out the show notes if you want to skip

32
00:03:15,398 --> 00:03:20,701
ahead to a particular topic. As our listeners
may know, our duel simulator is so advanced

33
00:03:20,961 --> 00:03:25,484
that it's gained sentience, and has named itself
the Artificial Lifeform for running extensive

34
00:03:25,524 --> 00:03:32,628
duels, just a rather very intelligent simulator.
9000 or Alfred Jarvis 9000. He has a quick

of the way, quick to the no prize! A no-prize

52
00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:28,955
is an award Marvel used to give out to fans.
Our version, the Dynamic Dual No Prize, is

53
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:33,576
a digital award we post on Instagram and in
our email newsletter for the person that we

54
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:38,578
feel gave the best answer to our question of
the week. Last week's question we asked, which

55
00:05:38,818 --> 00:05:43,879
not currently existing MCU character would you
like to see get their own mini-series under

56
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,841
the Marvel Spotlight banner and why? And this
is coming off of the news that the Echo television

57
00:05:48,881 --> 00:05:54,974
series on Disney Plus will be under a new Marvel
Spotlight banner that focuses on stories that

58
00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:59,055
are disconnected from the larger MCU narrative.
Got a lot of great answers, let's go ahead

59
00:05:59,095 --> 00:06:02,917
and run down our honorable mentions as well
as the no prize winner. Our first honorable

60
00:06:02,957 --> 00:06:09,858
mention goes to Rick McGrew, who said, Hey guys,
Rick from the Retro Nomopod. The character

61
00:06:09,878 --> 00:06:14,560
I would choose for a Marvel character not in
the MCU currently that would get their own

62
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,701
series would be Mr. Sinister. He's been involved
in a lot of major events and kind of always

63
00:06:19,721 --> 00:06:26,096
been in the shadows. and he was even mentioned
kind of in New Mutants the movie, but he'd

64
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:31,399
be my pick, Mr. Sinister. Yeah, that's a great
answer. Mr. Sinister is a major X-Men villain

65
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:37,182
and with the X-Men characters kind of up and
coming or soon to come into the MCU, I think

66
00:06:37,222 --> 00:06:41,445
it'd be a great idea to kind of explore some
of these characters within the Marvel Spotlight

67
00:06:41,465 --> 00:06:45,847
banner before introducing them as threats in
the X-Men movies. Yeah, we haven't done a dual

68
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:51,106
episode yet with Mr. Sinister and that's a shame.
Yeah, that is a crime. Seven years! And how

69
00:06:51,126 --> 00:06:56,070
do you do that without Mr. Sinister matchup?
Weird! I don't know. Who would he go up against

70
00:06:56,110 --> 00:07:01,855
though? That's not my problem. That's the executive
producer's problem. Hahaha! Great answer, Rick.

71
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:07,660
Our next honorable mention goes to... Travis
Herndon, who said... Hey guys, Travis here.

72
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,564
So my pick would have to be KZarr. I know he's
a D-list hero, but I feel like you can do an

73
00:07:12,624 --> 00:07:19,640
interesting story following him. him introducing
the Savage lands into the MCU as well as introducing

74
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:25,423
other characters like Moon Boy and Devil Dinosaur
into the MCU. I feel like there's a lot of

75
00:07:25,463 --> 00:07:31,126
potential with him in bringing in something
as crazy as the Savage land lands into the

76
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:37,190
MCU finally will be an interesting world building
experience. So yeah. Yeah, Kezar is a great

77
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,012
idea for Marvel Spotlight Banner, especially
since his stories take place in the Savage

78
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:45,554
land, which is all the way down in Antarctica.
And really like. When is the MCU ever going

79
00:07:45,574 --> 00:07:51,338
to go down and explore Antarctica? The continent
is largely, you know, isolated, and so therefore

80
00:07:51,398 --> 00:07:55,301
the stories of the savage land could also be
largely isolated. I think it's a fantastic

81
00:07:55,381 --> 00:08:01,265
answer, especially since it's kind of a way
to incorporate these like Jurassic Park type

82
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:06,649
elements with like the dinosaurs and the jungle
and everything into the MCU, which we haven't

83
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:10,638
really seen before. Yeah, we really haven't
seen that anywhere outside of Jurassic Park.

84
00:08:10,818 --> 00:08:15,920
And I actually know who would be a perfect duel
matchup for Kezar if we ever did that duel.

85
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:20,441
Commandee. Yeah. Oh, for sure. Yeah, that's
perfect. Maybe one day we'll get around to

86
00:08:20,461 --> 00:08:24,982
that. Obviously, Mr. Sinister would be a priority
over Kezar, but Kezar is a cool character.

87
00:08:25,122 --> 00:08:30,524
It would be cool to even pair him up in like
a team duel alongside Shanna the She-Devil.

88
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:35,865
You know what's crazy though is that Dustin
Balcom gave this exact same answer of Kezar.

89
00:08:36,322 --> 00:08:41,324
So apparently, Kaiser has a lot of fans out
there. We need to capitalize on that soon with

90
00:08:41,364 --> 00:08:46,407
a duel. I'm all for it. Let's do it. Great answer,
Travis and Dustin. Our final honorable mention

91
00:08:46,467 --> 00:08:53,051
goes to Luke Tucker, who said, Hey guys, this
is Luke. And I would like to see a Sentry miniseries

92
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:57,873
under the Marvel Spotlight banner. I think with
the darker themes and more mature tone that

93
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:02,676
it's setting up, we could really go into the
backstory of Robert Reynolds as a meth addict

94
00:09:03,016 --> 00:09:07,727
who finds the golden Sentry serum and becomes
a superhero. who's kind of like Marvel's answer

95
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:12,270
to Superman. I think with him rumored to appear
in the Thunderbolts movie, it'd be a perfect

96
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:17,455
time to do this. All right, thanks guys. Finally,
someone we have done a duel with, right? We

97
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:22,098
recently did a duel with the Sentry against
General Zod, which was a pretty good episode.

98
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:26,762
I think this is a fantastic answer. The rumor
is that the Sentry is going to be the primary

99
00:09:26,802 --> 00:09:32,410
villain of the Thunderbolts movie, as Luke said,
but the Sentry... really has a great enough

100
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:37,534
story that deserves its own project outside
of just being, you know, relegated to villain

101
00:09:37,574 --> 00:09:42,918
status in another film. I think the Sentry is
a phenomenal, if not a perfect candidate for

102
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,961
a Marvel Spotlight banner series. Yeah, the
answers we've received so far, I think this

103
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:53,005
one has the most likelihood of actually happening
considering the rumors that he's in Thunderbolts.

104
00:09:53,605 --> 00:09:56,347
Right. Yeah, I think they would actually be
doing the character of the

105
00:10:00,158 --> 00:10:05,059
a substantial amount of time to his story, apart
from the Thunderbolts story. Cause right, in

106
00:10:05,099 --> 00:10:09,640
the Thunderbolts movie, you want to see more
of like the team dynamic, not necessarily the

107
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,462
villain, maybe I could be wrong, but yeah, I
think a century mini series would be fantastic.

108
00:10:15,882 --> 00:10:20,163
So great answer, Luke. We want to give a quick
shout out to Andrew Shunk and Nate Mantineo

109
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:24,964
for also leaving your answers. Although Andrew
Shunk was like, Marvel sucks. Let's do a Marvel

110
00:10:25,004 --> 00:10:30,742
spotlight show for a DC character cause Marvel
sucks. And uh, Yeah, great answer. That was

111
00:10:30,762 --> 00:10:38,866
not a great answer. But the winner of this week's
Snow Prize is Colby Hentges, who said, hey,

112
00:10:38,886 --> 00:10:45,329
boys, Colby Hentges, I'd like to see Marvel
Spotlight in part fix Marvel's villain problem.

113
00:10:45,849 --> 00:10:51,452
Give me a backstory. Give me the motivation.
Give me the raison d'etre. That way, when they

114
00:10:51,472 --> 00:10:56,382
show up on the big screen at the end of some
movie, everybody already knows what's up. I

115
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:03,064
want Marvel Spotlight to give me Victor Von
Doom. Hell yes, bro. This is the perfect answer,

116
00:11:03,144 --> 00:11:08,907
right? Victor Von Doom, Dr. Doom, one of the
greatest, if not the greatest, Marvel villain

117
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:14,769
in all of Marvel history. Absolutely has yet
to be done justice on the big screen for one,

118
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:22,032
but also has a fascinating backstory on his
own that should be explored in a project separate

119
00:11:22,052 --> 00:11:25,454
from a Fantastic Four movie. Kind of like how
the Loki television series, You know, Loki's

120
00:11:25,474 --> 00:11:30,395
such a fascinating character. He got his own
show. I think Dr. Doom is definitely worthy

121
00:11:30,475 --> 00:11:35,056
of getting his own show. Yeah, Dr. Doom, and
actually, I think a lot of MCU villains would

122
00:11:35,076 --> 00:11:39,938
be good enough to get their own series, which
would help their villain problem. I think that

123
00:11:40,038 --> 00:11:43,759
the villain for the film we're gonna review
later on in this episode, the Marvel's Darben,

124
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:48,480
yeah, give her own thing. That way we learn
a little bit more about the backstory and lead

125
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:54,442
up to this film. Darben was only like an eight.
issues of the comic book, so I don't know if

126
00:11:54,462 --> 00:11:58,804
she even has enough backstory to explore in
her own television show. I dunno, make it a

127
00:11:58,864 --> 00:12:03,306
Hollis series then, I don't care. Just more.
Yeah, yeah. A Kree series, yeah, that could

128
00:12:03,326 --> 00:12:08,168
work. But it wouldn't work as well as Doctor
Doom. Doctor Doom needs to have his own Marvel

129
00:12:08,288 --> 00:12:12,750
spotlight series, enough said. So great answer,
Colby, for winning this week's No Prize. If

130
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,511
you, the listener, want a shot at winning your
own No Prize, stay tuned to later on this episode

131
00:12:16,531 --> 00:12:21,613
when we'll be asking another Question of the
Week. And now that that's done, on to the news!

132
00:12:27,182 --> 00:12:32,103
Alright this past week the SAG-AFTRA strike
with the studios ended, actors are allowed

133
00:12:32,143 --> 00:12:37,864
to go back to work, but due to the length of
the strike, both the writer strike and the

134
00:12:37,944 --> 00:12:41,766
actor strike, we have some new release dates
to report. A lot of things got pushed back

135
00:12:41,926 --> 00:12:48,947
and I'm not happy about it. Damn studios. But
um, the Deadpool movie was the first victim.

136
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:54,229
The movie was supposed to come out on May 3rd.
It was supposed to open up the summer movie

137
00:12:54,289 --> 00:13:00,225
season in 2024. It's been pushed back to the
middle of summer and will now come out on July

138
00:13:00,305 --> 00:13:06,110
26th. This was my most anticipated upcoming
Marvel movie, so to see it get pushed back

139
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,933
like this is heartbreaking because I'm really
impatient and I don't want to wait an additional

140
00:13:09,973 --> 00:13:15,898
few months but you know, such is the life of
a comic book movie fan. Am I right? I mean,

141
00:13:15,938 --> 00:13:21,963
not a DC fan, Superman Legacy kept its release
date. Well, good for you, that's still not

142
00:13:21,983 --> 00:13:27,967
coming out until 2025 so I'm not even thinking
about that right now. The July 26th release

143
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:32,730
date was originally held by Captain America
Brave New World. That movie got pushed back

144
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:39,954
to 2025 on Valentine's Day, February 14th. Another
movie to get pushed back into 2025 is The Thunderbolts,

145
00:13:39,994 --> 00:13:45,277
which was originally going to come out around
Christmas time on December 20th, 2024. That's

146
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:49,640
now going to come out in the middle of the summer
of the next year on July 25th. And the final

147
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:55,023
casualty for Marvel Studios is Blade. Seemingly
this movie is never gonna come out. I think

148
00:13:55,043 --> 00:14:00,187
this is like the fifth or sixth delay that it's
received, but the movie was originally gonna

149
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:07,052
come out on Valentine's Day 2025, and is now
coming out at the end of the year on November

150
00:14:07,152 --> 00:14:14,357
7th, 2025. So that's all horrible news. In addition
to Marvel Studios, Sony also had to push back

151
00:14:14,397 --> 00:14:21,402
their release of Venom 3, which was originally
gonna come out July 12th, 2024. but got pushed

152
00:14:21,422 --> 00:14:26,464
back to the end of the year on November 8th,
2024. A lot of bullcrap for, you know, something

153
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:32,006
that I feel like could have been solved simply,
you know. But that being said, I don't have

154
00:14:32,026 --> 00:14:37,048
any skin in the game. I don't know what I'm
talking about. Yeah, no, you don't. I'm actually

155
00:14:37,088 --> 00:14:43,191
surprised to hear that some of those release
dates were relatively soon. Like Venom three,

156
00:14:43,431 --> 00:14:47,572
I don't know. They had planned on releasing
that next summer. Yeah, just a few months after,

157
00:14:47,732 --> 00:14:51,714
you know, Deadpool three, which was the soonest
movie. that was gonna come out that got pushed

158
00:14:51,754 --> 00:14:56,116
back. I don't know what is now gonna open the
summer movie season. I don't know if anything's

159
00:14:56,136 --> 00:15:01,598
gonna take that May 3rd place. Something will,
obviously, but it would have been nice to have

160
00:15:01,658 --> 00:15:06,440
Deadpool there. These delays are like all too
common now ever since the days of COVID. And

161
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,282
I guess even before that, you know, these things
get delayed all the time. It's just always

162
00:15:10,602 --> 00:15:14,363
difficult to report on. It just means that I'm
gonna be that much older when I do finally

163
00:15:14,403 --> 00:15:20,698
get around to seeing the movie, you know? Yeah,
you're gonna be like 40 Jeez, almost. I'm not

164
00:15:20,718 --> 00:15:25,379
even thinking about 2025 right now. You know,
the days are long, the years are short. Hopefully

165
00:15:25,899 --> 00:15:30,581
these movies will be with us before we know
it. I think the biggest downer regarding this

166
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:36,142
news is just that this phase bore of Marvel
that it's going through is just going to go

167
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:41,964
on longer. You know, like get to Secret Wars
already. Restart this shit. Why don't you shut

168
00:15:42,004 --> 00:15:46,685
the hell up? We are no longer in phase four.
We are in phase five. You don't know what the

169
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:54,409
hell you're talking about. Phase five. More
like phase. I got nothing. More like phase

170
00:15:54,849 --> 00:16:00,572
dive or die. The day is dying. That's better.
No, that no, that doesn't work. Dragon try

171
00:16:00,592 --> 00:16:06,636
to get some other time. All right. I guess DC
did have one delay. Creature Commandos was

172
00:16:06,676 --> 00:16:12,239
supposed to come out in 2024, but I guess that
may get pushed back to 2025. I'm not sure if

173
00:16:12,259 --> 00:16:17,662
that's official yet, but that's the rumor. But
in other DC television news. We got to our

174
00:16:17,722 --> 00:16:24,588
first official teaser for the Dead Boy Detectives,
which is going to premiere on Netflix. Originally,

175
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:29,292
this was a show that was going to be made for
Max. But since it was not within the vision

176
00:16:29,732 --> 00:16:35,697
of James Gunn and Peter Safran's new DC universe,
they pushed it to Netflix and they're making

177
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:41,174
it a part of the same universe as the Sandman
series, because the Dead Boy Detectives. written

178
00:16:41,194 --> 00:16:45,475
by Neil Gaiman and they first debuted within
the Sandman comic so it makes sense. I'm actually

179
00:16:45,575 --> 00:16:51,477
happy that it's going to be in the same universe
as the Sandman because the Sandman was freaking

180
00:16:51,517 --> 00:16:56,698
amazing. I loved that series. I can't wait for
season two and I think the Dead Boy Detectives

181
00:16:56,718 --> 00:17:01,820
will be a good holdover until we get that second
season. Of course, if you've been watching

182
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:06,101
the Doom Patrol, you're very familiar with the
Dead Boy Detectives. They appeared in season

183
00:17:06,141 --> 00:17:10,556
two of that show. And I actually really liked
the episode. I thought they did a really good

184
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:15,660
job of interpreting the dead boy detectives
for the screen. I was hoping that they were

185
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,944
gonna stick with the same cast of characters,
and that may have been the original plan, but

186
00:17:19,964 --> 00:17:25,328
it looks like they went a different route for
this Netflix show. Yeah, I knew nothing about

187
00:17:25,368 --> 00:17:30,993
the dead boy detectives prior to that episode
on Doom Patrol season two. I thought they were

188
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:35,276
actually really compelling characters watching
that episode. But after watching this trailer,

189
00:17:35,456 --> 00:17:43,598
I think the opposite. trailer sucked. It definitely
had a vibe of its own that really didn't make

190
00:17:43,638 --> 00:17:48,821
it feel like it was set in the same world as
Sandman. It still feels quite a bit like Doom

191
00:17:48,841 --> 00:17:54,105
Patrol, and I feel like this may almost be like
a replacement for that show's wackiness now

192
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:58,928
that the Doom Patrol is coming to an end with
its fourth and final season. I can't say I

193
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:04,432
really care too much for the actors they chose
for Charles and Edwin this time, but again,

194
00:18:04,472 --> 00:18:10,231
this is just a teaser. It's a short one. a minute
and 20 seconds long, so maybe I'm judging prematurely.

195
00:18:10,711 --> 00:18:16,074
We'll see. I guess my major gripe is that on
Doom Patrol, the characters look like how they

196
00:18:16,114 --> 00:18:20,696
do in the comic books, because I looked up what
they look like in the comic books. One's blonde,

197
00:18:20,796 --> 00:18:25,758
one's brunette, they have very different vibes
going on. But literally, the actors who play

198
00:18:25,778 --> 00:18:31,641
the dead boy detectives in this Netflix series
could be twins. They look so much alike in

199
00:18:31,681 --> 00:18:36,912
their faces, and it throws me off. That's fair.
I actually thought the very same thing the

200
00:18:36,932 --> 00:18:41,296
first time I saw this. I was like, wait, which
one is Charles? Which one is Edwin? They look

201
00:18:41,396 --> 00:18:47,442
way too similar to be in the same fucking show
together. That's really bad casting. I also

202
00:18:47,462 --> 00:18:52,667
didn't care for the casting of Crystal Palace
either. Maybe it was just because she said

203
00:18:52,687 --> 00:19:00,546
that the name Dead Boy Detectives was stupid.
And I was like, fuck you. No, it's not. Obviously,

204
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:04,048
it's the coolest name ever. The entire premise
is right there in the title, just like something

205
00:19:04,068 --> 00:19:08,810
like Robocop, you know? It's a great name. Exactly.
Right. Plus, I think it's bad form just to

206
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:13,053
do that in the teaser for the show, where you're
supposed to be getting people pumped up about

207
00:19:13,113 --> 00:19:17,515
it. And the character within the series is like,
oh, yeah, this is dumb. Like, don't do that.

208
00:19:17,995 --> 00:19:22,438
Yeah, it doesn't do a great job of actually
selling the show, right? Not at all. What does

209
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:27,140
do a good job of selling the show is sort of
seeing like the ghost aspects of the characters,

210
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,894
like when they run through walls and stuff like
that. That's gonna be interesting. And you

211
00:19:30,914 --> 00:19:35,017
know, the premise that they're running from
death is also pretty interesting. Although

212
00:19:35,057 --> 00:19:39,939
I wonder if they're gonna go with death from
Sandman in this series. If it's part of the

213
00:19:39,959 --> 00:19:45,322
Sandman universe, they kind of need to. Right,
oh, that's a great question. Yeah, we know

214
00:19:45,362 --> 00:19:50,005
that death was played by Kirby Halle-Baptiste
in the Sandman series. If they go with someone

215
00:19:50,085 --> 00:19:55,368
else, then that likely means that this show
is not actually in the Sandman series continuity,

216
00:19:55,468 --> 00:20:00,543
right? Right, exactly. We'll see who they go
with. They do mention during the teaser that

217
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:05,006
this is not only part of the Sandman universe,
but also brought to you from the producers

218
00:20:05,127 --> 00:20:10,671
of You and The Flight Attendant, which are both
fantastic shows. So I think that bodes really

219
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:15,494
well for the series. Allegedly fantastic, I've
never seen either of them. They're good. I've

220
00:20:15,534 --> 00:20:18,797
seen both of them, they're great. I don't know
if we're going to be reviewing the series.

221
00:20:18,937 --> 00:20:23,540
We'll talk to the executive producers about
it, and we'll let you guys know, I guess, as

222
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:27,772
we get closer to the show's release date. Yeah,
we don't actually have a release date for the

223
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:34,520
series yet, but I'm guessing it's coming sometime
early 2024. But in regards to this show of

224
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,725
characters set within the Sandman universe,
that brings us to our question of the week.

225
00:20:43,202 --> 00:20:48,486
What other characters from the Sandman Universe
do you hope get their own series on Netflix?

226

and award that person a Dynamic Duel No Prize

230
00:21:05,258 --> 00:21:11,047
that we'll post to Instagram and our email newsletter.
Be sure to answer before… November 25th. This

231
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:14,871
question of the week is actually running a little
bit longer because there won't be a question

232
00:21:14,911 --> 00:21:20,537
of the week in the next episode considering
Jonathan is traveling for work. Right. So November

233
00:21:20,557 --> 00:21:24,722
25th, that's your cutoff date for this question.
That gives everyone plenty of time to read

234
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:30,127
all the Sandman comic books, which you should
have done already because they're fantastic

235
00:21:30,668 --> 00:21:32,089
and come up with some character ideas.

236
00:21:39,394 --> 00:21:42,999
But that does it for all the news for this episode,
so let's go ahead and move on to the main event,

237
00:21:43,499 --> 00:21:47,605
where we review the latest Marvel Studios theatrical
release, The Marvels.

238
00:22:02,862 --> 00:22:07,664
Alright, The Marvels came out this past week,
directed and co-written by Nia DaCosta and

239
00:22:07,764 --> 00:22:14,448
starring Brie Larson, Teyana Paris, and Iman
Vellani. The film is a sequel to the 2019 film

240
00:22:14,508 --> 00:22:18,690
Captain Marvel, also starring Brie Larson as
the titular character, but you could also say

241
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:23,232
The Marvels is a sequel to the Secret Invasion
Disney Plus television series, the WandaVision

242
00:22:23,272 --> 00:22:29,236
series, and the Ms. Marvel series. This movie
follows up a lot of other stories, and if you're

243
00:22:29,356 --> 00:22:34,060
asking if it's necessary to have seen all of
these shows before watching the film, I'm gonna

244
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:39,224
say, kind of. You could probably skip Secret
Invasion, but to really feel like you're not

245
00:22:39,264 --> 00:22:43,627
just jumping into the middle of a story, it's
probably better to have seen the rest of the

246
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:48,791
shows. That being said, this review is a spoiler
review for the Marvels, but we'll probably

247
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:53,302
also be dropping plot points from everything
else that the movie follows. So here's your

248
00:22:53,342 --> 00:22:59,626
spoiler warning for the other stuff too. Again,
Wandavision, Secret Invasion, and Ms. Marvel.

249
00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:04,030
Yeah, you got a lot of homework if you haven't
been keeping up with the MCU recently. Yeah,

250
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:07,552
I'm not gonna say the movie is impossible to
follow if you haven't seen this other stuff,

251
00:23:07,792 --> 00:23:12,455
but I think you'll actually get a lot more enjoyment
out of it if you do. Kind of like a lot of

252
00:23:12,495 --> 00:23:16,658
Marvel's other stuff that's heavily steeped
in continuity, right? But the number of projects

253
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:22,502
that this film follows is kind of the film's
main downfall, is it not? Like, Totally, The

254
00:23:22,542 --> 00:23:26,964
Marvels tries to be as cohesive as it can, but
you know, like the juvenile humorous world

255
00:23:26,984 --> 00:23:32,066
of Ms. Marvel is much different than like the
scientific sort of odd background of Monica

256
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:36,328
Rambeau's story in WandaVision, which was different
than the kind of cosmic level adventures of

257
00:23:36,388 --> 00:23:41,290
Captain Marvel. You know, I won't say that the
film fails in wrangling this all together in

258
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:46,532
one package. I actually think that Nia DaCosta
did an admirable job of compiling it all in

259
00:23:46,652 --> 00:23:52,411
one tone. But in terms of story, editing, and
overall... pace, I'd say the film wasn't as

260
00:23:52,451 --> 00:23:57,255
successful. And this is like exacerbated by
the fact that, you know, the story of the movie

261
00:23:57,295 --> 00:24:01,518
involves these characters jumping around and
teleporting all over the place from one corner

262
00:24:01,538 --> 00:24:06,522
of the galaxy to the other. So it really gives
you this whiplash feeling that never really

263
00:24:06,802 --> 00:24:11,726
leaves. Like even later on in the movie, I blinked
and suddenly the Marvels were in some sort

264
00:24:11,746 --> 00:24:16,189
of like wheat field planet talking in one moment
and in the next they're like across the universe

265
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:21,625
toward Earth. between the actual swapping of
the characters, the space jumping, like warp

266
00:24:21,725 --> 00:24:27,169
points factoring heavily into the story, and
all the references to backstories that hopefully

267
00:24:27,209 --> 00:24:31,131
people have seen, you know, the story can feel
like a lot to keep up with. And this is coming

268
00:24:31,171 --> 00:24:36,455
from me, a guy who I think has a pretty good
handle on the MCU as a whole. I can't imagine

269
00:24:36,495 --> 00:24:40,722
how people who come into this movie fresh will
react, you know, it can't be easy. Yeah, I

270
00:24:40,802 --> 00:24:45,084
honestly was wondering as I was watching the
movie in the theater, how many audience members

271
00:24:45,204 --> 00:24:50,968
had seen everything and if any of them were
lost. My wife certainly was, my daughters certainly

272
00:24:51,008 --> 00:24:55,551
were. Well that's because you're raising a DC
household and you need to be exposing them

273
00:24:55,571 --> 00:24:59,813
to more Marvel stuff, I think, for, you know,
their own health. They watched Loki with me,

274
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:04,796
they actually liked Loki. They watched WandaVision,
I believe, but it was so long ago that they

275
00:25:04,936 --> 00:25:09,575
really didn't remember much about it. I think
the biggest detriment to the film in regards

276
00:25:09,635 --> 00:25:14,699
to all of this was the editing moves at a breakneck
pace, way too fast, I think, for its own good.

277
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,082
You know, the movie has the shortest runtime
out of any Marvel Studios movie to date at

278
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:24,426
just one hour and 45 minutes. I think if you
clocked that up closer to two hours, you would

279
00:25:24,446 --> 00:25:30,510
have had a much more cohesive, understandable
narrative that felt less bonkers. Yeah, I definitely

280
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:35,053
think there was a lot of room to explore a lot
of things that they really just brushed over.

281
00:25:35,273 --> 00:25:41,242
Like... Kamala Khan's eagerness to save Skrulls
and the realization that her hero was, you

282
00:25:41,262 --> 00:25:45,244
know, a real person, you know, despite all of
her power, couldn't save everyone. You know,

283
00:25:45,305 --> 00:25:49,408
I think they really could have explored that
more. I think they really could have set up

284
00:25:49,428 --> 00:25:54,491
the film's villain a little bit more, maybe
with even like a pre-title sequence to the

285
00:25:54,531 --> 00:25:58,694
story showing what they alluded to later on
in the film of Captain Marvel destroying the

286
00:25:58,714 --> 00:26:03,614
Supreme Intelligence and things like that. Yeah,
particularly when it came to The villain of

287
00:26:03,634 --> 00:26:09,598
the movie, Darben, a lot of her actions and
motivations were explained in retrospect. Right?

288
00:26:09,738 --> 00:26:14,321
We had no idea what was going on with the jump
points until the three Marvel's ladies figured

289
00:26:14,361 --> 00:26:18,944
it out. We didn't know what was happening. We
didn't know why she was doing all this until

290
00:26:19,104 --> 00:26:22,706
we learned about the current state of Hala and
how it got that way. You know, the movie just

291
00:26:22,726 --> 00:26:27,249
didn't do any favors for itself in terms of
how it structured the narrative, how it edited

292
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:33,092
it, and the pacing. Honestly, this film is sort
of exactly what I feel like a lot of audience

293
00:26:33,112 --> 00:26:38,055
members are tired of when it comes to MCU films.
It just feels like it's just too much to keep

294
00:26:38,095 --> 00:26:41,897
up with and it's a jumbled mess. I think this
film is actually going to hurt Marvel down

295
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:46,559
the line in terms of, you know, are people going
to be interested in future MCU films or just

296
00:26:46,579 --> 00:26:51,122
feel like there's just too much homework? It's
a valid concern. I don't think the movie is

297
00:26:51,162 --> 00:26:55,384
going to hurt the overall brand because all
that being said regarding the film's messy

298
00:26:55,404 --> 00:26:59,586
structure, I actually had a lot of fun with
the movie more so than other recent Marvel

299
00:26:59,606 --> 00:27:04,007
films like Ant-Man Quantumania and Guardians
of the Galaxy 3, though I will definitely say

300
00:27:04,047 --> 00:27:08,348
that Guardians 3 was a better movie. A more
somber movie that had some really sad moments,

301
00:27:08,528 --> 00:27:13,890
but obviously still a better movie. The Marvels
was like a bubblegum sort of film whose only

302
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:18,491
concern was to deliver a fun time, right? And
in that regard, I think it succeeded. The action

303
00:27:18,531 --> 00:27:23,773
choreography was top notch. We saw some of the
best camera work since the fight scene in the

304
00:27:23,793 --> 00:27:27,173
first Doctor Strange movie that happened in
Hong Kong where everything was going backwards.

305
00:27:27,806 --> 00:27:31,788
I think the stunt team had the work cut out
for them and the opening action scene where

306
00:27:31,808 --> 00:27:36,531
it was going between the three ladies at the
Khan home, out in space, and on the Saber space

307
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:40,794
station is probably some of the coolest stuff
you'll ever see from Marvel Studios. The swapping

308
00:27:40,814 --> 00:27:45,357
gimmick was a great way to present superhero
action in a new and interesting way. Although

309
00:27:45,377 --> 00:27:51,300
I'm still confused how that was set up. So essentially
their powers became entangled because Captain

310
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:57,463
Marvel and Monika Rambeau We're near a jump
point at the same time. And Kamala Khan is

311
00:27:57,523 --> 00:28:01,584
using one half of the quantum band that caused
all the chaos to begin with. Oh, I mean, that's

312
00:28:01,604 --> 00:28:07,225
all bullshit. You know, the science reasoning
behind the swapping, I think, is one of the

313
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:12,067
flimsiest things about the film. OK, good. It's
not just me then. Right. Monika Rambeau rationalized

314
00:28:12,127 --> 00:28:16,928
it as quantum entanglement, but they already
used quantum entanglement in the Ant-Man and

315
00:28:16,948 --> 00:28:22,670
the Wasp movie. Right. And in that movie, it
was a way for Michelle Pfeiffer's Janet Van

316
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:27,972
Dyne character to communicate telepathically
through Scott Lang's character. But here, it's

317
00:28:27,992 --> 00:28:33,115
a physical teleportation, so apparently quantum
entanglement can result in all sort of manner

318
00:28:33,155 --> 00:28:37,637
of effects in the MCU. But you know, it's hard
to be nitpicky about that because the whole

319
00:28:37,677 --> 00:28:42,719
nature of superheroes in general requires a
suspension of disbelief, and the end result

320
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:47,321
of the swapping itself is fun enough that you
don't really want to question it, even though

321
00:28:47,481 --> 00:28:51,055
it all makes no sense. But again, you know,
that's kind of like another thing that just

322
00:28:51,115 --> 00:28:55,679
adds to the sort of messy feel to the film,
right? One of the best things I could say about

323
00:28:55,719 --> 00:29:00,582
the movie overall is that I walked out of the
movie theater more excited for the future of

324
00:29:00,602 --> 00:29:06,026
the MCU than any movie since Spider-Man No Way
Home. And that's largely because of, you know,

325
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:11,390
how the movie ended, the end scene as well as
the mid-credit scene. Those scenes alone almost

326
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:17,707
raised this rating up a half a star because
they were fantastic. I loved how Ms. Marvel

327
00:29:17,927 --> 00:29:22,171
was inspired by her team up and took the initiative
to start recruiting a Young Avengers team.

328
00:29:22,191 --> 00:29:25,633
You know, we've been waiting for that for years
now, and it was cool to see that finally take

329
00:29:25,673 --> 00:29:29,837
effect, especially since she did it the exact
same way that Nick Fury did in the first Iron

330
00:29:29,857 --> 00:29:33,820
Man movie. Almost line for line, but with her
own comedic twist. I thought that was great.

331
00:29:34,421 --> 00:29:40,670
Seeing beasts in his true form on screen for
the first time gives me so much hope. for the

332
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:45,853
future of the X-Men and how they are portrayed
on screen. It's going to be hopefully so comic

333
00:29:45,873 --> 00:29:51,717
book accurate just based on the look of Hank
McCoy, voiced by Kelsey Grammer from X-Men

334
00:29:51,737 --> 00:29:57,021
The Last Stand. Honestly, I... Get out of here.
Don't even start. What are you going to say?

335
00:29:58,082 --> 00:30:02,665
I mean, we've already seen someone from the
X-Men universe in a Marvel movie, in the whole

336
00:30:02,685 --> 00:30:08,569
Multiverse of Madness film. We've already seen
Hawkeye. I don't get like all the hype over

337
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:13,130
these scenes. I mean, it's like Big Whoop. It's
just more of the same. You're building to this

338
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:17,832
half for how long? And it's like, OK, now that
we get a little more so more, how about you

339
00:30:17,852 --> 00:30:23,334
just flip the switch and do it already? They
got to build up, man. They're building anticipation.

340
00:30:23,794 --> 00:30:27,295
Yeah, we've seen Professor X before. And it
was cool that he was in his yellow chair, but

341
00:30:27,335 --> 00:30:32,877
largely Professor X manifested in an expected
way, you know, portrayed by Patrick Stewart.

342
00:30:33,277 --> 00:30:38,130
But this version of Beast wasn't just like.
you know, Kelsey Grammer in horrible prosthetics,

343
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:43,672
like it was an X-Men The Last Stand or in X-Men
First Class with Nicholas Holt or in Days of

344
00:30:43,692 --> 00:30:49,333
Future Past. Like all that shit was horrible
looking. Like this beast in this movie was

345
00:30:49,893 --> 00:30:55,015
perfection. It was perfection. Are you really
that excited over an underlight? Yes. Holy

346
00:30:55,075 --> 00:31:02,517
shit. Yes. All right. That's right. I am that
excited. It's going to be great. I can't wait.

347
00:31:02,857 --> 00:31:08,745
I guess binary was cool. That was cool. Yeah,
it was cool that they included Binary here.

348
00:31:08,905 --> 00:31:14,650
Binary being one of the many aliases that Carol
Danvers has used over the years. It was interesting

349
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:19,154
to see Maria Rambeau take over that role. And
you know, she was actually Captain Marvel herself

350
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:23,879
in the Multiverse of Madness movie. So there
apparently are like a lot of universes out

351
00:31:23,899 --> 00:31:29,304
there where Maria was the one that took the
fighter jet and had the light speed engine

352
00:31:29,404 --> 00:31:33,487
Cosmic Cube incident from... Captain Marvel
movie. But speaking of things that I enjoyed

353
00:31:33,507 --> 00:31:37,068
about the movie, one of the things I most enjoyed
were the characters. So let's go ahead and

354
00:31:37,088 --> 00:31:42,670
talk more about them in our character breakdown.
Starting with Captain Marvel, aka Carol Danvers,

355
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:49,293
played by Brie Larson. Brie Larson did her best
work as the character in this movie. She wasn't

356
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:53,915
annoying like she was in Avengers Endgame, and
she wasn't a robot like she was for most of

357
00:31:53,955 --> 00:31:58,937
the first Captain Marvel movie. I feel like
the character finally got to shine and be herself.

358
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:03,951
in the Marvels, which I think is fantastic because,
well, I'll admit that Brie Larson isn't perfect

359
00:32:03,992 --> 00:32:08,293
for the role, I am rooting for her as Carol
Danvers because I think there's potential there.

360
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:14,516
I do think there's potential. I don't think
this film was her best work. You know, I thought

361
00:32:14,536 --> 00:32:19,218
she conveyed more emotion in some of her many
post-credits scenes, you know, when she's talking

362
00:32:19,238 --> 00:32:23,880
to like Shang-Chi or something like that. Yeah.
If this is Captain Marvel being her true self,

363
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,386
then her true self is boring as fuck. You're
boring as fuck. You know what the fuck. Fuck

364
00:32:28,406 --> 00:32:31,710
you're talking about. What are you talking about?
What do you mean boring? Dude, yeah, she was

365
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:36,896
like the least interesting character in the
whole damn movie. I disagree with that statement.

366
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:41,482
Obviously the villain was the least interesting
character. I mean, they were like the same.

367
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:48,662
I like how in the film she went from a guilt-ridden
loner to rediscovering her more. personable,

368
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:52,925
likeable side through this new sisterhood that
gets established. I think Monica and Kamala

369
00:32:52,945 --> 00:32:57,448
helped her become this lighter character that
maybe we can see more of if Brie Larson returns

370
00:32:57,488 --> 00:33:01,831
to the role. Not only did she grow emotionally,
I think, in this movie, I think the plot device

371
00:33:01,871 --> 00:33:07,415
of having to swap places with less experienced
heroes and kind of keep her on the back foot

372
00:33:07,455 --> 00:33:12,219
in that regard, it made her more vulnerable
and humble and more interesting of a character

373
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:17,543
because Captain Marvel was, you know, too overpowered
from the get-go. The swapping definitely helped

374
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:22,367
alleviate that. I also thought that as I was
watching it, because you're right, she's billed

375
00:33:22,447 --> 00:33:28,352
as Marvel's most powerful character. She freaking
tanked a headbutt from freaking Thanos in Endgame,

376
00:33:28,392 --> 00:33:33,957
right? So yeah, I thought this actually was
a smart way to sort of not degrade her power,

377
00:33:34,357 --> 00:33:39,542
but make it so that she can't just solve everything
so easily. Right, exactly. Which, you know,

378
00:33:39,682 --> 00:33:43,945
was kind of a criticism of the first Captain
Marvel movie is that once she unlocked the

379
00:33:43,965 --> 00:33:48,604
full- potential of her powers, she was essentially
unstoppable, right? The way they chose to go

380
00:33:48,624 --> 00:33:53,468
about fixing that worked really well in an exciting
way. I do think there are some things they

381
00:33:53,528 --> 00:33:58,191
inserted in this movie to make Brie Larson more
interesting as Captain Marvel that didn't quite

382
00:33:58,231 --> 00:34:07,037
work, specifically the whole fucking singing
planet. Yeah, my theory is that they were kind

383
00:34:07,057 --> 00:34:12,601
of going for like a Disney princess angle with
planet Aladdin and her princess role on that

384
00:34:12,641 --> 00:34:16,651
planet. You know, she even got like a dress
and everything like that. I do have to say

385
00:34:16,891 --> 00:34:21,133
I really liked her costume in this movie more
than in the Captain Marvel film. I thought

386
00:34:21,153 --> 00:34:25,815
it was really well done. I liked her dress too,
you know, the Captain Marvel take on the dress

387
00:34:25,995 --> 00:34:29,956
worked really well. I think a lot of girls will
appreciate the fashion choices made in this

388
00:34:29,996 --> 00:34:37,159
movie. But if we're talking about the musical
scene in general, I mean, it was a joke, right?

389
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:41,961
It was played for laughs more than anything
else, which felt unnecessary because of that.

390
00:34:42,494 --> 00:34:47,345
I mean, if it was a joke, it was a joke that
went on for way too long. Not really. Come

391
00:34:47,405 --> 00:34:51,273
on. It was like two minutes. And I was just
watching it. I was like, I looked at my wife

392
00:34:51,313 --> 00:34:56,975
and I was like, what the fuck is this? You know
what's gonna be a joke that's gonna go on for

393
00:34:57,035 --> 00:35:06,024
two hours? Joker Follyado. Oh shit, I can't
say anything, can I? That's right. Joker Follyado

394
00:35:06,524 --> 00:35:14,182
is gonna be a musical in its entirety. So, but
it's gonna be a good one. Yeah, okay. Let's

395
00:35:14,202 --> 00:35:20,083
go ahead and move on to Photon, AKA Monica Rambeau,
played by Teyona Paris. Now, I call her Photon

396
00:35:20,303 --> 00:35:24,365
only because the movie never really settled
on a superhero name for her, which was kind

397
00:35:24,385 --> 00:35:29,246
of frustrating. Like, Ms. Marvel even named
a few of her aliases from the comics that she's

398
00:35:29,266 --> 00:35:35,008
had, including Spectrum and Pulsar. Of course,
Monica was the original female Captain Marvel,

399
00:35:35,128 --> 00:35:39,669
but right now she's going by Photon in the comics,
which is my favorite name for her, and I wish

400
00:35:39,689 --> 00:35:44,071
they would have brought that up in the film.
But Teyana Paris, I think she's a more than

401
00:35:44,091 --> 00:35:47,973
capable actor. I think she did a good job of
selling like the deep seated resentment she

402
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:51,976
had toward Carol for not returning like she
said she would. I think Teyana did a great

403
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:55,978
job with the action. And I thought she had some
funny moments too. She's really good with her

404
00:35:56,018 --> 00:36:00,441
line delivery. Yeah, I thought she was fantastic.
I have like nothing bad to say about her. It

405
00:36:00,461 --> 00:36:05,824
was a great performance. I think she's definitely,
you know, Avengers caliber material for whenever

406
00:36:05,844 --> 00:36:09,710
they make the next Avengers film. She hopefully
is on that team. Yeah, she has a great power

407
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:14,291
set for that team too. Although for like the
average viewer, I feel like her power set isn't

408
00:36:14,351 --> 00:36:19,933
as well defined as I would like it. You know,
in the movie, she says that she can see light,

409
00:36:20,273 --> 00:36:24,854
if I remember correctly. But I'm like, that's
not really it. Her power is that she can emit

410
00:36:24,994 --> 00:36:30,336
and become and absorb any form of energy on
the electromagnetic spectrum. You know, from

411
00:36:30,636 --> 00:36:36,554
X-rays to visible light, to electricity, to
ultraviolet and infrared light. You know, I

412
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:41,037
like to see the MCU actually explicitly state
her powers as that, because I think it would

413
00:36:41,057 --> 00:36:46,100
help audiences understand the character more.
That's actually very true. I was really wondering,

414
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:50,743
like, what the differences were between her
and Carol Danvers, like laser powers, like

415
00:36:50,784 --> 00:36:55,347
the scene where Carol is surprised that Monaco
is able to shoot a laser to like solve this

416
00:36:55,387 --> 00:37:00,170
problem on the ship. I was like, well, can you
have done that? Like, why did you need her

417
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:06,342
help to do this at all? Yeah. And the last bit
where she sacrifices herself. I don't know

418
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:11,765
what the fuck happened there. She absorbed all
the energy from the quantum bands and the photonic

419
00:37:11,786 --> 00:37:16,589
energy from Kenta Marvel in order to have enough
power to seal the rift. But I think you're

420
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:19,971
right in that they didn't explain that very
well. Like it was a bunch of scientific mumbo

421
00:37:20,011 --> 00:37:26,355
jumbo on behalf of Monica Rambeau's part. I
don't envy the actress at all for all the science

422
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:30,959
flux capacitor shit she had to say in this movie.
I did love Monica Rambeau's outfit, though.

423
00:37:30,979 --> 00:37:35,021
I thought she had the best one. Yeah, I mean,
essentially it was just a Saber space station.

424
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:40,384
uniform but yeah it looks really cool. The whites
and blacks just popped for some reason. Let's

425
00:37:40,404 --> 00:37:45,686
go ahead and move on to Miss Marvel aka Kamala
Khan who was played by Iman Valani. I really

426
00:37:45,706 --> 00:37:49,788
liked Iman Valani as Kamala Khan in the Miss
Marvel television series. I think that was

427
00:37:49,828 --> 00:37:54,910
a fantastic debut for this up-and-coming actress
and I really liked her in this movie. You know

428
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:58,731
in many ways she was the heart of the film and
the glue that really brought the team together

429
00:37:58,911 --> 00:38:03,373
in such you know an innocent way born out of
just the love and admiration she had for these

430
00:38:03,433 --> 00:38:08,691
other women. Yeah, no, I agree. She was my favorite
part of the whole movie. Like to me, I think

431
00:38:08,711 --> 00:38:13,693
she was the star. I assumed that she would get
a little bit grating based on her appearances

432
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:17,815
in the trailers, but I found myself not bothered
by that too much. Maybe there are a few moments

433
00:38:17,835 --> 00:38:21,977
where she was a little bit overexcited, but
considering the circumstances, I think she

434
00:38:21,997 --> 00:38:26,879
kind of played it true to what the character
would do. No, the actress is just so endearing.

435
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,861
My daughter, Grace, who's 12 years old, she
loved Miss Marvel. Yeah, that was hands down

436
00:38:32,901 --> 00:38:36,964
her favorite. of the three. I think it was a
lot of people's favorite for sure. And she

437
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:41,307
had some great moments. I like the moment with
the revelation about Carol visiting Monica's

438
00:38:41,347 --> 00:38:47,832
mom, Maria, after Monica was blipped. When Kamala
hugged Monica and then when Carol joined, it

439
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:52,235
was the turning point for the team. It's when
they became a team. It was cool to see that.

440
00:38:52,395 --> 00:38:57,199
It was cool seeing her prove herself and achieve
her dream going from an obscure Jersey City

441
00:38:57,239 --> 00:39:02,975
hero to a legit superhero. That was a lot of
fun. Yeah. I definitely think that she was

442
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:09,118
a good foil in a way for Captain Marvel in that
Captain Marvel is a pretty cold character,

443
00:39:09,218 --> 00:39:14,581
at least the way Brie Larson plays her. And
Iman Villani definitely is not. You're right.

444
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:19,604
She just has this exuberance and innocence and
excitement about her that just makes people

445
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:25,427
like the character. I would say that Brie Larson's
semi-cold depiction of Carol Danvers is not

446
00:39:25,447 --> 00:39:31,262
without basis in the comics. Carol Danvers in
the comics is fairly straightforward. AKA boring

447
00:39:31,462 --> 00:39:36,524
AF. Some of my favorite moments with Ms. Marvel
dealt with her awkwardness. You know, like

448
00:39:36,544 --> 00:39:41,686
how her vision of her going twinsies with Captain
Marvel didn't quite play out like she thought

449
00:39:41,706 --> 00:39:45,868
it would. She just brought a lot of humor to
the film. Yeah, like when we reviewed Ms. Marvel,

450
00:39:45,888 --> 00:39:50,230
the show, I think I mentioned during that review
that I liked that series way more than I thought

451
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:54,251
I would. And I was really glad to see that her
personality survived intact for this movie.

452
00:39:54,571 --> 00:39:59,313
Although I got to say, her family didn't translate
quite as well in the movie as it did in the

453
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:04,303
show. I would agree with that, totally. Actually,
a lot of the side characters in this movie

454
00:40:04,363 --> 00:40:10,445
felt like they were television extras, right?
Including Kamala Khan's family, including the

455
00:40:10,545 --> 00:40:15,887
extras on the Saber space station. They just
felt out of place. Right. Yeah. Like, I still

456
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:20,568
don't get why Kamala's family had to even go
up to the space station. Well, their home was

457
00:40:20,608 --> 00:40:24,898
destroyed. But you're right. That doesn't necessarily
mean they have to go to a space station. Like

458
00:40:24,938 --> 00:40:28,981
go to a fucking hotel or something. Exactly.
You know? Yeah. And like, why didn't they get

459
00:40:29,061 --> 00:40:34,085
eaten by cats when everyone else did? Like probably
people who are more important and necessary

460
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:38,228
to the critical function of the space station
and everything. That's a valid point. They

461
00:40:38,248 --> 00:40:43,573
had special privileges, I guess. Regarding Miss
Marvel, though, a really interesting question

462
00:40:43,613 --> 00:40:49,417
came up while I was watching the movie. So in
the Miss Marvel TV series, you and I theorized

463
00:40:49,477 --> 00:40:55,380
that. The bangle that Ms. Marvel received that
unlocked her powers was a Kree Negaband, which

464
00:40:55,420 --> 00:41:01,023
in the comics were the weapons worn by the original
Captain Mar-Vell. And we ended up not being

465
00:41:01,063 --> 00:41:07,347
too far off because the bangle actually turned
out to be a quantum band. And the Negabands

466
00:41:07,427 --> 00:41:11,169
were the Krees' attempt to recreate the quantum
bands in the comics, but the quantum bands

467
00:41:11,209 --> 00:41:17,000
are worn by the hero Quasar. who has the power
of energy construct generation, similar to

468
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,244
Green Lantern, which is why we picked Quasar
in a duel against Green Lantern on this podcast.

469
00:41:22,744 --> 00:41:29,409
But I'm wondering, is Ms. Marvel with her energy
construct generation powers, the MCU's version

470
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:33,992
of Quasar? I mean, I think she has to be right
now, right? Not only does she have Green Lantern

471
00:41:34,032 --> 00:41:38,675
powers, she has the literal quantum bands. Although
I guess Carol had one of them at the end as

472
00:41:38,735 --> 00:41:42,734
well. I'm not sure why. They were like friendship
bracelets now or something. Yeah, they never

473
00:41:42,774 --> 00:41:46,538
really got into that. I guess they just assumed
it was better to keep the quantum band separate

474
00:41:46,638 --> 00:41:51,323
from each other. But now I totally think of
Ms. Marvel as Quasar. Which like, how do you

475
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:57,489
feel about that? Not great. You know, I think
a lot of people had issues with the depiction

476
00:41:57,529 --> 00:42:02,666
of Ms. Marvel's powers translating from the
comics to the screen. You know, in the comics,

477
00:42:02,727 --> 00:42:08,252
Ms. Marvel is a polymorph. She can stretch.
But in the show, it's her energy construct

478
00:42:08,292 --> 00:42:12,936
form that stretches, which is certainly easier
to render using special effects than showing

479
00:42:13,016 --> 00:42:17,781
her physical body stretching. But having her
generate these sapphire looking constructs

480
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:23,326
isn't true to the comics, right? Neither is
her being quasar. At the end of the day, I

481
00:42:23,366 --> 00:42:28,763
think the more true things are to the comics,
the Although I guess the one argument you can

482
00:42:28,783 --> 00:42:34,507
make that she's not the MCU's Quasar is that
her powers aren't derived from the Quantum

483
00:42:34,527 --> 00:42:39,930
Bands. That's true. I mean, they only unlocked
her powers, but in the MCU, Ms. Marvel is a

484
00:42:40,010 --> 00:42:44,413
mutant. But that's another thing, you know,
because in the comics, Ms. Marvel is an inhuman.

485
00:42:44,834 --> 00:42:50,798
So, I don't know. I don't know. It's all strange,
but it did fascinate me to think that we have

486
00:42:50,838 --> 00:42:56,081
witnessed the MCU's first iteration of the character
of Quasar. Let's go ahead and move on to Supremor.

487
00:42:56,702 --> 00:43:01,984
aka Darben, played by Zowie Ashton. I'll start
off by saying Zowie Ashton wasn't the total

488
00:43:02,004 --> 00:43:06,566
trainwreck I thought she'd be based on the trailers
for this movie. She wasn't as goofy as I thought

489
00:43:06,586 --> 00:43:11,448
she'd be, I think her character had legit motivations
for the destruction she caused and for her

490
00:43:11,468 --> 00:43:15,509
hatred of Captain Marvel. I think honestly the
worst thing you could say about the character

491
00:43:15,549 --> 00:43:21,732
is that she was generic AF. Yeah. But I partially
blame that on the fact that, like I said earlier,

492
00:43:21,772 --> 00:43:26,238
the character of Darben was only in 8 issues
of the comics back in the early 90s. Like we're

493
00:43:26,258 --> 00:43:30,781
talking bottom of the F-less barrel here. And
so there wasn't much characterization to build

494
00:43:30,861 --> 00:43:36,685
off of from the source material. I don't really
understand why Marvel Studios would do that,

495
00:43:37,166 --> 00:43:40,788
why they would make Darben the villain when
there were so many other Kree characters they

496
00:43:40,808 --> 00:43:45,872
could have gone with. Yeah, for sure. Like bring
back Jude Law, go with Jai Min Han Su. Why

497
00:43:45,912 --> 00:43:50,675
not? Well, Jai Min Han Su was killed in the
first Guardians movie as- I mean, bring back

498
00:43:50,715 --> 00:43:57,520
Jude Law. As Yon-Rogg? Yeah. Although, you know,
they called the character of Darben Supremor

499
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,723
in this movie. That was like her title. I'm
wondering why they just couldn't make the villain

500
00:44:01,763 --> 00:44:08,087
of the movie Supremor from the comics, you know,
who is an android personification of the supreme

501
00:44:08,127 --> 00:44:13,711
intelligence and is really well known among
Marvel Comics fans as the de facto ruler of

502
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:18,434
the Kree. Supremor is a badass. Like, like,
I think a better scenario for this movie would

503
00:44:18,454 --> 00:44:25,259
have been that the supreme intelligence actually
wasn't destroyed by Carol. and during the time

504
00:44:25,299 --> 00:44:29,582
it took for it to reboot itself, you know, the
Kree have their civil war and the devastation,

505
00:44:30,142 --> 00:44:35,085
and then once Supremor reboots and then tries
to restore Hala to its former glory. Like,

506
00:44:35,125 --> 00:44:39,609
wouldn't that have been a better angle considering
they already did some setup for the Supreme

507
00:44:39,629 --> 00:44:43,251
Intelligence in the first Captain Marvel movie
with Annette Benning playing the character?

508
00:44:43,731 --> 00:44:49,315
Yeah, absolutely. I really like Supremor as
a villain in the comics. Darben is not Supremor.

509
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:54,414
One of these days we'll get Supremor in a dual
episode. Yeah, maybe we could put Supreme War

510
00:44:54,454 --> 00:44:59,036
up against like Brother Eye or something like
that. Eradicator. I don't know. I don't know

511
00:44:59,056 --> 00:45:02,958
anything about Supreme War. That could work.
I do have to say that I was really confused

512
00:45:03,098 --> 00:45:09,541
by Darbin's use of the Ronin Hammer. Like it
glowed purple as if it was powered by the Infinity

513
00:45:09,601 --> 00:45:14,283
Stone, but it wasn't. Yeah, that was kind of
a bad visual effects call, right? So Ronin's

514
00:45:14,303 --> 00:45:18,565
hammer is called the ultimate weapon, as you
know from our Ronin the Accuser versus Big

515
00:45:18,605 --> 00:45:22,847
Barda duel episode that we did. Right. I thought
it was interesting how she paired it with the

516
00:45:22,867 --> 00:45:26,569
quantum bands. I think the fact that she had
the quantum bands in this movie was a great

517
00:45:26,709 --> 00:45:31,712
way to foil the energy-based powers of the Marvel's
characters, because what the quantum bands

518
00:45:31,752 --> 00:45:37,015
can do in the comics is tap into any power source
in the entire universe. So the fact that she

519
00:45:37,035 --> 00:45:41,558
was absorbing all of their energy blasts with
the quantum band made her a great threat to

520
00:45:41,598 --> 00:45:44,900
the heroes. Let's go ahead and move on to the
final character in our character breakdown,

521
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:50,946
Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson. As always,
Sam Jackson defines the character of Nick Fury,

522
00:45:51,066 --> 00:45:56,188
he is Nick Fury, but this Nick Fury was far
more laid back in this movie than I thought

523
00:45:56,208 --> 00:46:02,650
he'd be considering the events of Secret Invasion.
At the end of that show, he and his wife, Vara,

524
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:07,491
went up into the Saber space station to begin
negotiating peace talks between the Kree and

525
00:46:07,511 --> 00:46:12,253
the Skrulls, but things were left semi-unresolved
at the end of that show, and you never get

526
00:46:12,273 --> 00:46:16,266
that sense here. No, yeah, absolutely. Like,
I thought- that his wife would have been a

527
00:46:16,326 --> 00:46:21,288
character in this movie as a Skrull since they
were dealing with Skrulls in this movie. But

528
00:46:21,328 --> 00:46:26,330
nope. It really just goes to show that like
Kevin Feige isn't in control of everything

529
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:30,831
in the way that we thought he was, at least
not in this new multiversal saga. There's just

530
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:34,973
more and more evidence for it. It does seem
like he's taking a few more vacations than

531
00:46:35,033 --> 00:46:40,440
he should be, right? Yeah, what the heck? Also,
like Nick Fury's guilt that he couldn't find

532
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:45,524
the Skrulls a home was such a central theme
of the Secret Invasion television show. And

533
00:46:45,544 --> 00:46:51,589
yet, the Skrulls' refuge on the planet Tarnax
in this movie seems pretty good, right? Like,

534
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:55,233
couldn't that be the Skrulls' home? Why couldn't
that be their home? What was the story with

535
00:46:55,273 --> 00:46:59,516
planet Tarnax? We'll never know. For real, like
that's what I was wondering during this movie.

536
00:46:59,556 --> 00:47:03,199
Like, why did all of the Skrulls have to come
to Earth in Secret Invasion? Why couldn't they

537
00:47:03,219 --> 00:47:06,973
go to that planet? Yeah, it's a great question.
But that does for all the characters. Let's

538
00:47:06,993 --> 00:47:08,965
go ahead and move into the story highlights.

539
00:47:14,678 --> 00:47:19,241

546
00:47:50,807 --> 00:47:55,730
accessories to choose from that let you rep
your fandom and still look like a million bucks.

547
00:47:56,231 --> 00:48:01,414
Take for instance, this Iron Man cuff bracelet
I got from the site. Honestly, I never even

548
00:48:01,494 --> 00:48:06,238
knew what a cuff bracelet was before I got it.
I've never worn a bracelet in my life. But

549
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:10,380
if you go to the site using the link in our
show notes, you'll see how badass this Iron

550
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:15,858
Man cuff bracelet is. It's just like something
Tony Stark would wear. It has a black plated

551
00:48:15,919 --> 00:48:21,780
gunmetal base with gold Iron Man helmet accents
on the ends. It has a super sleek modern design.

552
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:27,782
And now you pretty much won't catch me without
it. So go to cufflinks.com, check out their

553
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:33,183
Marvel and DC stuff, or you know, Star Wars,
Harry Potter, they have it all. And shop for

554
00:48:33,203 --> 00:48:38,845
the holidays using code dual20 at checkout.
I promise you, it'll be the coolest site you

555
00:48:38,865 --> 00:48:46,785
visit all season. Thanks guys! Alright, a group
of Kree soldiers led by Supreme-Or Darben discover

556
00:48:46,825 --> 00:48:51,589
the missing Quantum Band on a barren planet
in space. Wondering where the other one is?

557
00:48:51,709 --> 00:48:57,634
We see it on Kamala Khan, Ms. Marvel, who fantasizes
about meeting her hero, Captain Marvel. I thought

558
00:48:57,654 --> 00:49:01,938
it was a great intro to the character of Ms.
Marvel. That little animated segment they had

559
00:49:01,978 --> 00:49:07,022
with her did a great job of setting up the backstory
as well as establishing the type of character

560
00:49:07,042 --> 00:49:11,618
she is. Yeah, I definitely think they did a
great job setting up Ms. Marvel. Definitely

561
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:15,980
better than they did setting up Mono Karambo
for anyone who hadn't seen Wandavision. But

562
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:20,643
again, I still think the whole beginning of
this movie should have been the scene of Captain

563
00:49:20,663 --> 00:49:25,065
Marvel destroying the Supreme Intelligence.
Right, yeah. To provide that context for the

564
00:49:25,085 --> 00:49:29,007
story as a whole. Because this whole time we'd
been wondering like what the heck is Captain

565
00:49:29,047 --> 00:49:33,790
Marvel doing out in space? You know, like she's
never on Earth to help out and it turns out,

566
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:38,612
you know, she's going to singing planets and
she's fucking up shit on Hala. Apparently too

567
00:49:38,652 --> 00:49:46,808
busy to reignite Apparently, what do you think
of that reasoning for Ms. Marvel's absence

568
00:49:46,828 --> 00:49:51,510
in general? I thought it was super lame. I did
not care for it. I thought it was okay. I mean,

569
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:55,192
the fact that she had great reason to be angry
at the Supreme Intelligence and destroy it

570
00:49:55,392 --> 00:50:00,934
and allegedly free the people of Hala and then
kind of be mopey about it when the entire planet

571
00:50:00,954 --> 00:50:05,416
went into chaos is kind of a big deal. I think
it was kind of a satisfying answer. Yeah, but

572
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:09,290
she wasn't just being mopey about it. She was
going off and... you know, singing, being a

573
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:13,373
princess. She had to be doing more than just
being mopey. She should have gone back and,

574
00:50:13,493 --> 00:50:18,396
you know, taking care of her niece. That's true,
which is, you know, the whole reason for Monica's

575
00:50:18,436 --> 00:50:22,319
resentment. But you know, Captain Marvel is
imperfect. I think they established that. I

576
00:50:22,339 --> 00:50:26,262
think it makes her a little bit more human.
When the jump point above Earth starts going

577
00:50:26,362 --> 00:50:32,045
haywire near the Saber space station, Nick Fury
has sword agent Monica Rambeau investigate.

578
00:50:32,470 --> 00:50:36,471
while he and Captain Marvel track the source
of the anomaly to the planet where Supreme

579
00:50:36,491 --> 00:50:41,553
War found the lost Quantum Band. The two women
make contact with the Haywire Jump Point energy

580
00:50:41,593 --> 00:50:47,196
simultaneously, which causes them and Ms. Marvel
all to swap places through teleportation. Now

581
00:50:47,416 --> 00:50:51,958
I know we discussed the whole nature of the
swapping thing is kind of bullshit, but I also

582
00:50:51,978 --> 00:50:58,260
have questions like if Ms. Marvel was included
in the three-way swap because it was the Quantum

583
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:03,486
Band energy that created and then disrupted
the Jump Point. Why wasn't Darben also included

584
00:51:03,826 --> 00:51:08,988
in their swap circle? She had the other quantum
band. That's a great question. That's a fantastic

585
00:51:09,028 --> 00:51:13,609
question. I'm kind of dissatisfied with the
reasoning behind the swap, even though I was

586
00:51:13,649 --> 00:51:18,430
satisfied with the effect it had on the film's
action. The three women struggle to come to

587
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:23,052
terms with their predicament as a fight with
Kree soldiers ensues in space on the Saber

588
00:51:23,092 --> 00:51:27,933
space station and in the Kahn family home. When
the fight is over and the three return to the

589
00:51:27,973 --> 00:51:34,091
original places. Monika and Fury visit Ms. Marvel
to discuss Monika's theory on quantum entanglement,

590
00:51:34,371 --> 00:51:38,612
which is causing them to switch places anytime
they use their powers simultaneously. I think

591
00:51:38,652 --> 00:51:43,633
I mentioned before I love this action scene.
I actually really got into it. I liked seeing

592
00:51:43,793 --> 00:51:48,255
how all three of them kicked ass in their own
unique ways, especially Ms. Marvel. I thought

593
00:51:48,275 --> 00:51:52,956
it was exciting to see her really come into
her own as a warrior. Yeah, I definitely think

594
00:51:52,976 --> 00:51:56,717
she had the most interesting power of the three
and I was always excited to see how she was

595
00:51:56,737 --> 00:52:02,959
going to use it As Captain Marvel investigates
peace talks between the Kree and Skrull empires

596
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:09,941
near a Skrull refuge on planet Tarnax, she inadvertently
swaps places with Monica and Ms. Marvel. Convinced

597
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:14,982
the talks are a trap due to Captain Marvel's
presence, Darben generates a jump point anomaly

598
00:52:15,182 --> 00:52:20,784
using her quantum band paired with the Universal
Weapon that creates a vacuum that sucks up

599
00:52:20,824 --> 00:52:25,745
the planet's atmosphere and destroys the Skrull
refuge. The three women save as many Skrulls

600
00:52:25,765 --> 00:52:31,694
as they can. arranging for them to live on New
Asgard, led by Valkyrie on Earth. This was

601
00:52:31,734 --> 00:52:36,097
a surprise. I didn't know Valkyrie was going
to make a cameo. Yeah, between Valkyrie's cameo

602
00:52:36,397 --> 00:52:41,482
and Hawkeye's, this is almost like an A-Force
film. Yeah, that's kind of true. Question though,

603
00:52:42,883 --> 00:52:47,887
in Secret Invasion, weren't the Skrulls and
all alien species on Earth deemed hostile by

604
00:52:47,987 --> 00:52:52,511
President Ritzen? Like New Asgard on Earth is
not going to be a safe place for the Skrulls.

605
00:52:53,111 --> 00:53:00,308
Also, I want to know how New Asgard... got control
of the Bifrost teleportation energy. That's

606
00:53:00,348 --> 00:53:04,630
right, wasn't it destroyed? The Bifrost was
destroyed. The only thing that can wield the

607
00:53:04,670 --> 00:53:10,254
Bifrost now is Thor's hammer Stormbreaker, which
is actually currently being wielded by Thor's

608
00:53:10,294 --> 00:53:16,057
daughter, which is still a stupid concept. Oh,
love? Ugh, I'd already forgotten about her.

609
00:53:16,237 --> 00:53:22,000
Why'd you remind me? Maybe she's dead and Thor
gave Stormbreaker to New Asgard and they can

610
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:27,095
use it to teleport now. Damn. Captain Marvel,
Monika, and Ms. Marvel deduced that it was

611
00:53:27,155 --> 00:53:31,578
Darben's rupturing of the jump points that led
to their quantum entanglement, and that the

612
00:53:31,639 --> 00:53:36,882
jump point instability is endangering the universe,
and that Darben is creating the anomalies to

613
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:42,846
bring resources to the devastated Kree homeworld
of Hala. The Marvels use scroll memory probe

614
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:48,270
technology to find Darben's next target, and
they train using their abilities in conjunction

615
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:52,433
with their swapping predicament. I really liked
the training montage. I thought that was a

616
00:53:52,453 --> 00:53:57,111
lot of fun. Yeah, yeah, I agree. It was well
done. It was cool. The jump rope thing, I thought

617
00:53:57,131 --> 00:54:01,872
was pretty creative and funny. Yeah, the whole
training montage, I thought was sufficiently

618
00:54:01,932 --> 00:54:07,613
girly for the audience. Yeah, girly and fun.
I liked it. The Marvels travel to the planet

619
00:54:07,653 --> 00:54:12,815
Aladdin to warn them of Darben's imminent arrival.
And it's revealed that Captain Marvel is actually

620
00:54:12,835 --> 00:54:17,176
the princess there. The three fight the Kree
forces in an attempt to steal the villains

621
00:54:17,236 --> 00:54:22,926
quantum band. But Darben discovers that Miss
Marvel has the other quantum band. and creates

622
00:54:23,026 --> 00:54:27,350
a jump point anomaly that siphons the planet's
water. We already talked about the musical

623
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:32,214
scene, it was meant to be a joke, but probably
an unnecessary one, they were just trying to

624
00:54:32,234 --> 00:54:38,399
be cute. I did like the conversation between
Monika and Kamala Khan as this was all happening

625
00:54:38,439 --> 00:54:42,803
and they're just kind of commenting on the ridiculousness
of it all. But my favorite joke in the whole

626
00:54:42,823 --> 00:54:47,026
movie actually also happens during the scene
during the fight with Darben when the villain

627
00:54:47,066 --> 00:54:51,294
sees that Kamala has the other Quantum Band
and she's like, where did you get that? And

628
00:54:51,474 --> 00:54:58,560
Kamala was like, my grandma sent it to me in
the mail. And that was fantastic. That's good.

629
00:54:58,580 --> 00:55:03,143
That's the kind of humor I like from Marvel
movies, not the freaking sing along. Yeah,

630
00:55:03,364 --> 00:55:07,687
yeah. Which, again, I guess I can't really see
anything about because of Joker Folly. I do.

631
00:55:08,107 --> 00:55:13,052
So scratch. I said that I love all the singing.
It's great. Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel and

632
00:55:13,092 --> 00:55:17,715
Monica escaped the Kree forces and Carol reveals
that she was the one who caused the devastation

633
00:55:17,755 --> 00:55:22,903
on Hala when she destroyed the Supreme Intelligence.
She figures that Darben is also acting out

634
00:55:22,943 --> 00:55:28,488
of revenge against her, destroying the places
she holds dear. They travel to Earth to discover

635
00:55:28,568 --> 00:55:34,173
Darben is attempting to steal the energy from
the sun next. When we got the flashback scene

636
00:55:34,253 --> 00:55:39,157
when Captain Marvel destroyed the Supreme Intelligence,
I was trying to figure out when she did that

637
00:55:39,217 --> 00:55:44,902
chronologically within the MCU timeline. Like,
I think it had to have happened sometime after

638
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:48,165
the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie, right?
Because like the Kree didn't seem like they

639
00:55:48,185 --> 00:55:53,141
were in shambles there. and they made the peace
treaty with Xandar and the Nova Corps. Yeah.

640
00:55:53,281 --> 00:55:56,643
Or maybe they signed the treaty because the
planet was kind of going into shambles and

641
00:55:56,663 --> 00:56:01,147
they didn't have adequate resources to fight
the Novo war anymore. But I do wonder maybe

642
00:56:01,187 --> 00:56:05,931
it happened post Avengers Endgame. Who knows?
I don't know. It would have been nice for them

643
00:56:05,951 --> 00:56:10,795
to answer that question, though. The whole MCU
timeline is messed up anyway. It's broken.

644
00:56:11,335 --> 00:56:16,339
Ever since the first fight. I know it. You're
right. No one does. I know it. I know. Except

645
00:56:16,359 --> 00:56:20,966
for this scene. I have no idea when this happened.
That's the only thing. Captain Marvel, Ms.

646
00:56:21,006 --> 00:56:26,929
Marvel, and Monica fight Darben and subdue her,
but the villain manages to steal Kamala's quantum

647
00:56:26,989 --> 00:56:32,211
band. Meanwhile, the unstable jump point near
Earth damages a majority of the Saber space

648
00:56:32,231 --> 00:56:36,252
station's escape pods, forcing the station's
crew to escape to Earth's surface by being

649
00:56:36,332 --> 00:56:41,134
swallowed by flurking kittens that were laid
by Goose. I loved the flurking kittens, you

650
00:56:41,154 --> 00:56:45,736
know, they didn't have much to do with the story
overall, but they were cute and the way they

651
00:56:45,756 --> 00:56:51,319
were incorporated into the plot made me laugh,
so there you I thought it was super effing

652
00:56:51,379 --> 00:56:57,244
random. It was like super convenient as well.
I hated everything about that. You're just

653
00:56:57,304 --> 00:57:02,589
a sad, bitter person, old man. Well, why? Because
I don't like flerkens because you don't like

654
00:57:02,749 --> 00:57:07,713
cute things like kittens swallowing people alive.
That shit's funny. I wonder if a lot of people

655
00:57:07,733 --> 00:57:13,017
are confused in that when flerkens eat things,
they actually store it within a pocket dimension

656
00:57:13,077 --> 00:57:17,281
inside of them. Like each flerkin has a little
black hole in their body. They don't necessarily

657
00:57:17,381 --> 00:57:23,351
ingest it. which is why Goose was able to bring
back the Cosmic Cube after she had swallowed

658
00:57:23,391 --> 00:57:27,372
it in the first Captain Marvel movie. The only
thing I found really funny about the Flurkins

659
00:57:27,472 --> 00:57:33,674
was when Goose was cleaning himself and Nick
Fury was like, hey, stop that. And Goose was

660
00:57:33,694 --> 00:57:38,096
just staring at him evilly, like mid-lick. I
was like, yeah, that's a cat. That's my cat.

661
00:57:38,796 --> 00:57:43,937
I like the Flurkin eggs. Just the concept of
a cat-like creature laying eggs I thought was

662
00:57:44,077 --> 00:57:48,527
funny. My least favorite part of the whole movie
happens during the scene when the escape pod

663
00:57:48,567 --> 00:57:54,508
carrying the Khan family and Nick Fury crashes
onto Earth after falling from fucking space.

664
00:57:54,888 --> 00:58:00,650
It literally crashes into the planet and no
one was hurt. The water was right there. They

665
00:58:00,690 --> 00:58:06,672
could have landed in the water. Right. So dumb.
I saw that and I was like, fucking Marvel.

666
00:58:07,612 --> 00:58:14,714
Whatever. Shut up. After being mortally wounded,
Darben destroys herself. by using the two quantum

667
00:58:14,734 --> 00:58:20,196
bands to open a rift in space to another reality.
Monica reasons that absorbing the energy from

668
00:58:20,496 --> 00:58:24,337
Captain Marvel and the quantum bands will let
her seal the rift and she gets stranded in

669
00:58:24,357 --> 00:58:28,579
the other reality despite Captain Marvel trying
to save her. Can I just say that I thought

670
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:34,361
it was a cool element that the quantum bands
were what created all the jump points throughout

671
00:58:34,421 --> 00:58:39,055
the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Yeah, that was
really cool and totally makes sense because

672
00:58:39,095 --> 00:58:43,939
Quasar is able to jump through space using the
quantum bands in a manner similar to the jump

673
00:58:43,959 --> 00:58:48,642
points in the Marvel universe. The jump points
themselves were always this unique things that

674
00:58:48,802 --> 00:58:53,265
made their first appearance in Guardians of
the Galaxy Vol. 2 but had no basis in the source

675
00:58:53,285 --> 00:58:57,968
material. You know, they were just something
that was out there that they ran with in subsequent

676
00:58:58,108 --> 00:59:02,912
spacefaring movies in the MCU. Right. But to
kind of get their origin now and kind of get

677
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:07,251
an explanation of what the hell these things
are. where they came from, I thought was pretty

678
00:59:07,271 --> 00:59:11,414
neat. Yeah, honestly, that's probably like my
favorite element of the entire movie was just

679
00:59:11,454 --> 00:59:16,639
that single line that solidified that in canon.
I was like, dope, that's cool. Yeah, I'm just

680
00:59:16,659 --> 00:59:20,862
a fan of the quantum bands in general from the
comics, they're cool. It was kind of a bummer

681
00:59:20,942 --> 00:59:25,126
that Darben got mortally wounded because we
didn't really get to see her do much with the

682
00:59:25,166 --> 00:59:28,889
quantum bands, but you know, tearing the rift
in space and time is a pretty epic way to go

683
00:59:28,989 --> 00:59:34,533
out. I do have a quick question. What was it
that removed the quantum entanglement exactly?

684
00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:39,752
It was the fact that they got ahold of both
quantum bands, I think. Don't ask me how, you

685
00:59:39,772 --> 00:59:43,635
know, I don't understand the whole swapping
thing anyway. All right. Now, it just, you

686
00:59:43,655 --> 00:59:48,597
know, confirmed my theory that it was all bullshit.
Captain Marvel travels to Hala and reignites

687
00:59:48,637 --> 00:59:53,861
its sun, restoring the planet to full habitability,
and Miss Marvel starts recruiting a young Avengers

688
00:59:53,901 --> 00:59:59,184
team, starting with Kate Bishop. Were you as
upset as I was that Captain Marvel didn't think

689
00:59:59,224 --> 01:00:06,152
to reignite Hala's son on her own? Well. Yeah,
it was kind of like a selfless idea on Monica

690
01:00:06,172 --> 01:00:10,275
Rambeau's part that you would have hoped a hero
like Carol Danvers would have had on her own.

691
01:00:10,695 --> 01:00:16,159
Yeah. It didn't take much effort at all. Like
she was perfectly fine afterward. Yeah, she

692
01:00:16,179 --> 01:00:19,921
should have done it a long time ago. It was
cool to see Haley Steinfeld in this last scene.

693
01:00:20,762 --> 01:00:24,765
Yeah, I think I mentioned during our Hawkeye
review, or maybe it was Ms. Marvel, that the

694
01:00:24,905 --> 01:00:29,708
female Hawkeye and Ms. Marvel's personalities
were very similar to each other. So I was kind

695
01:00:29,748 --> 01:00:34,038
of concerned about how that would play out.
in something like a Young Avengers film or

696
01:00:34,098 --> 01:00:38,500
series. But seeing the two characters quipped
back and forth has actually done pretty well,

697
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:42,782
I thought. Yeah, I can't wait for them to announce
the Young Avengers project whenever they get

698
01:00:42,802 --> 01:00:46,283
around to it. Maybe they won't show up until
the next Avengers movie, who knows. But I assume

699
01:00:46,303 --> 01:00:51,906
that we'll get a few more scenes with Aman Valani
recruiting other young characters. Yeah, it

700
01:00:51,926 --> 01:00:55,887
was during that scene that Kamala mentioned
that someone had a son or something like that.

701
01:00:56,268 --> 01:01:03,158
I didn't hear who. Daughter. Oh, Ant-Man. Oh,
OK, cool. In the mid-credits scene, Monica

702
01:01:03,178 --> 01:01:08,621
wakes up in the alternate reality she was trapped
in a hospital bed. Next to her is her mom Maria

703
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:15,905
Rambeau aka the superhero binary and Dr. Hank
McCoy aka Beast. Great way to end the movie.

704
01:01:15,966 --> 01:01:19,848
I actually think that this end credit scene
alone is going to bring a lot of people to

705
01:01:19,888 --> 01:01:23,690
the theater to see the film even though you
know the movie isn't projected to do all that

706
01:01:23,830 --> 01:01:28,512
great financially. So many people are going
to get excited by this end credit scene. Actually

707
01:01:28,553 --> 01:01:33,471
that scene has already leaked online. So I think
a lot of people are just bootlugging it on

708
01:01:33,491 --> 01:01:37,875
Twitter. Well, shit. Everybody stay off the
damn internet until you see this movie. That's

709
01:01:37,915 --> 01:01:41,317
my suggestion. And if you've listened to this
review, I'm assuming that you have seen the

710
01:01:41,337 --> 01:01:47,321
movie. But that does it for the movie. Overall,
the film is a mixed bag. On one hand, it's

711
01:01:47,341 --> 01:01:50,804
all over the place. On the other hand, it's
really enjoyable. In a sense, it follows a

712
01:01:50,844 --> 01:01:55,887
number of Marvel films and TV series. The movie
is structurally messy, but it provides a fun

713
01:01:55,927 --> 01:02:00,922
time with lots to get excited about for the
MCU's future. I'm rating the film three and

714
01:02:00,942 --> 01:02:07,324
a half stars, a fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
Yeah, I guess I would give this a fresh rating

715
01:02:07,444 --> 01:02:12,945
as well, just barely. But I think it deserves
it. I would definitely recommend it for people

716
01:02:12,985 --> 01:02:16,986
on the fence, whether or not they've seen any
of the prior television shows in lead up to

717
01:02:17,026 --> 01:02:22,028
this movie. I definitely think it could have
and should have been better than it was. But

718
01:02:22,268 --> 01:02:27,269
I still really like the characters, if not the
story. Yeah, the movie's passable, which, you

719
01:02:27,369 --> 01:02:31,271
know, I'm OK with. I think it was fine. I think
three and a half stars is certainly a more

720
01:02:31,311 --> 01:02:36,195
honest rating than what you gave for Blue Beetle
and The Flash. I think everybody should give

721
01:02:36,215 --> 01:02:39,817
Jonathan shit for giving The Flash four and
a half stars and Blue Beetle four. Because

722
01:02:39,997 --> 01:02:43,800
I don't think Blue Beetle was better than this
movie. I think Jonathan's bias is showing.

723
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:48,523
Alright, maybe The Flash should not have been
four and a half stars. I could see four stars

724
01:02:48,543 --> 01:02:52,606
for that because I've seen it a few times recently.
And I think I gave it four and a half just

725
01:02:52,646 --> 01:02:58,038
because I got to see Christopher Reeve with
Superman again. So yeah, call it like... Immediately

726
01:02:58,138 --> 01:03:03,722
post review bias as time has passed. I do think
that's four stars. Blue Beetle's four stars,

727
01:03:03,762 --> 01:03:08,185
too, though. Like Blue Beetle was better than
the Marvels. If you say so, bro, if you say

728
01:03:08,245 --> 01:03:14,409
so, I do say so. But that does it for this review,

duel episode in December, Alfred Pennyworth

739
01:04:07,046 --> 01:04:12,708
versus Edwin Jarvis. Our next episode is going
to be a duel. I know that Loki season two has

740
01:04:12,728 --> 01:04:17,249
had its season finale by this point, but we're
actually gonna kick that review back a week

741
01:04:17,289 --> 01:04:22,667
because Jonathan will be traveling for work.
So next episode is going to be in lead up to

742
01:04:22,767 --> 01:04:28,310
the upcoming team duel of the Legion of Doom
versus the Masters of Evil. Therefore we are

743
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:35,114
pitting Enchantress versus Enchantress. DC's
Enchantress versus Marvel's Enchantress. Yeah,

744
01:04:35,134 --> 01:04:38,356
this will be the first time we're pitting two
characters with the same name against each

745
01:04:38,396 --> 01:04:43,319
other. And Marvel's Enchantress kind of ties
into Loki season two, given that Enchantress

746
01:04:43,379 --> 01:04:48,201
is also an Asgardian like Loki. Yeah, I'm looking
forward to it. But that does it for this episode.

747
01:04:48,522 --> 01:04:53,243
We want to give a big thanks to our executive
