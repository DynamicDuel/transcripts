00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:06,652
This is a Dynamike Network podcast. Hey everyone,
Marvelous Joe here at the top of the episode.

2
00:00:07,012 --> 00:00:11,414
With the approaching holiday season, we're officially
underway with this year's holiday charity drive

3
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:16,317
and lead up to our charity dual episode in a
few weeks, which is gonna be Alfred Pennyworth

4
00:00:16,357 --> 00:00:21,659
versus Edwin Jarvis. This year, all donations
will be going once again to Pop Culture Classroom,

5
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:27,282
a nonprofit organization that delivers educational
resources to school districts, teachers, and

6
00:00:27,322 --> 00:00:32,644
community organizations using comics, graphic
novels, and related pop culture media. Their

7
00:00:32,684 --> 00:00:37,886
mission is to inspire a love of learning, increase
literacy, and build community through the tools

8
00:00:37,926 --> 00:00:43,488
of popular culture and the power of self-expression.
To donate, visit our official store through

9
00:00:43,528 --> 00:00:49,051
dynamicduel.com where you'll find two donation
options. One, if you're Team DC, and one if

10
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:54,753
you're Team Marvel. Or you could go directly
to dynamicduel.com slash donate DC, one word,

11
00:00:55,333 --> 00:01:00,681
or... dynamicduel.com slash donatemarvel, which
are linked in our show notes. We're making

12
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:05,805
the charity drive a competitive duel this year,
except the only stat is which side can donate

13
00:01:05,825 --> 00:01:10,368
the most. Everyone who donates will receive
a digital poster featuring original art of

14
00:01:10,468 --> 00:01:15,071
Alfred and Jarvis drawn New Yorker style by
Johnny DC. One lucky random donor will win

15
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:19,114
a framed print of the Alfred versus Jarvis art
that we'll announce during that December duel

16
00:01:19,154 --> 00:01:24,586
episode. Which fan base is the most charitable?
Right now, Marvel is still ahead. with four

17
00:01:24,606 --> 00:01:29,752
more donations than DC. So Marvel guys, let's
keep it going. Let's keep it going. DC guys,

18
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:33,197
y'all are a bunch of slackers. I said it. On
with the show.

19
00:01:53,582 --> 00:01:57,783
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

20
00:01:58,103 --> 00:02:02,944
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based

21
00:02:03,024 --> 00:02:09,146
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother Johnny DC. And in this episode,

22
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:15,767
we're going to review season 4 of the Mac series
Doom Patrol, which ended actually a few weeks

23
00:02:15,807 --> 00:02:20,369
ago, but we're just getting to the review now.
It was a fantastic season. I mean, not the

24
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:25,731
best probably, but the show is just so good.
I don't know if I would say it's my favorite

25
00:02:25,811 --> 00:02:31,574
DC show now that Sandman has been made, but
it's definitely up there, and this season did

26
00:02:31,614 --> 00:02:35,976
not disappoint. We'll talk all about season
4 later on this episode. Before that, we're

27
00:02:35,996 --> 00:02:39,438
going to break down the comic book movie news
to come out this past week, of which we just

28
00:02:39,458 --> 00:02:45,882
have one news item, and that is the official
trailer 2 for the Suicide Squad Isekai anime

29
00:02:46,042 --> 00:02:51,044
animated series. As always, we list our segment
times in our episode description, so feel free

ahead. to a particular topic. As our listeners

31
00:02:55,387 --> 00:03:00,392
may know, our duel simulator is so advanced
that it's gained sentience and has named itself

32
00:03:00,432 --> 00:03:05,776
the Artificial Lifeform for running extensive
duels, just a rather very intelligent simulator

33
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:15,046
9000 or Alfred Jarvis 9000. He has a quick message

with that out of the way, quick to the No Prize!

56
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:36,272
A No Prize is an award Marvel used to give out
to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel No Prize,

57
00:05:36,592 --> 00:05:41,430
is a digital award we post on Instagram and
in our email newsletter. for the person that

58
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:47,291
we feel gave the best answer to our question
of the week. Last week we asked if Brainiac

59
00:05:47,371 --> 00:05:53,453
is the villain in Superman Legacy, who would
you cast as the character and why? We got a

60
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:57,154
lot of great answers for this one, it seems
like you guys were really excited to cast a

61
00:05:57,214 --> 00:06:01,135
potential villain for the new DCU, so let's
go ahead and run down our honorable mentions

62
00:06:01,175 --> 00:06:06,837
as well as the no prize winner. Our first honorable
mention goes to, Miggy Mathingian, who said,

63
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:12,411
Hey what's up guys, it's Miggy, and I would
cast Mads Mikkelsen as Brainiac. Imagine the

64
00:06:12,451 --> 00:06:17,594
zeal of the first Doctor Strange villain, the
intelligence of the banker from Casino Royale,

65
00:06:18,014 --> 00:06:22,717
and the poison evil of Hannibal Lecter. And
I think that would be a perfect Brainiac villain.

66
00:06:23,537 --> 00:06:29,161
He's also done a bunch of these like tentpole
blockbuster movies, so he would have no trouble

67
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:34,244
doing it. All right, thanks guys. Yeah, Mads
Mikkelsen is a fantastic actor. As many of

68
00:06:34,264 --> 00:06:40,007
you know, he was Casilius in the first Doctor
Strange film. but he has yet to play a role

69
00:06:40,027 --> 00:06:44,851
in DC to my knowledge. And I think he'd make
a fantastic Brainiac for sure. Yeah, the guy

70
00:06:44,891 --> 00:06:50,014
does a lot of villain roles, but luckily he's
a good actor. So they all feel somewhat different.

71
00:06:50,054 --> 00:06:54,398
And I think he could bring actually quite a
bit to the role of Brainiac. So I agree, great

72
00:06:54,478 --> 00:07:01,323
answer. Our next honorable mention goes to Jacob
Bell, who said. What's up guys, Jacob, Jacob

73
00:07:01,343 --> 00:07:08,528
Bell here. I'm gonna go with Oscar Isaac. for
the role of Brainiac. I think that we know

74
00:07:08,568 --> 00:07:13,972
how he can act. We know he's a great actor.
We know that he has the look. I think his look

75
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:18,736
would be perfect for Brainiac in particular.
I know that X-Men Apocalypse wasn't a great

76
00:07:18,816 --> 00:07:23,379
movie, but we know that he has that in him.
And I think a second chance would be awesome.

77
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:27,682
And I think this role in particular, Brainiac
would be perfect for that. So I'm gonna go

78
00:07:27,702 --> 00:07:31,865
with Oscar Isaac. You know, when I first heard
Jacob Bell's answer of Oscar Isaac, I was like.

79
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:37,975
I mean, that guy's like in everything. Hasn't
the guy already played a DC role? And no, he's

80
00:07:37,995 --> 00:07:43,360
played three different Marvel roles. He's in
the MCU as Moon Knight, he was in the Fox X-Men

81
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:48,625
universe as Apocalypse, and he's in the Sony
Spider-Man universe as Spider-Man 2099. But

82
00:07:48,665 --> 00:07:53,370
he has yet to do a DC role. Yeah, I mean, I
agree. He might be a little overexposed right

83
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:59,438
now, but if I heard the news that he was cast
as Braniac. I wouldn't hate it to be honest,

84
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:04,199
because I think he's a fantastic actor. Yeah,
I go back to his villain role in Ex Machina.

85
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:09,521
Oh yeah. I think, just take that role and apply
it to the character of Brainiac, that cold

86
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:14,982
calculating persona. I think that'd be fantastic.
It'd be perfect. For sure. Great answer, Jacob.

87
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:21,184
Our next honorable mention goes to Lizzie Dyer
Arnie. Who said? Hey, it's Lizzie. Definitely

88
00:08:21,224 --> 00:08:26,405
inspired by Invincible for this week's Question
of the Week. I think Zachary Quinto would make

89
00:08:26,425 --> 00:08:31,800
an excellent Brainiac. He's a good villain and
he can play a great character without emotion

90
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:38,685
as we've seen in Robot Uninvincible and as Mr.
Spock. Also, he can nail the monotone voice

91
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:44,870
that is needed to play Brainiac. He'd be great
in the DC universe. So yeah, when I think of

92
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:50,554
robotic actors, Zachary Quinto is definitely
one of the few that comes to mind first. His

93
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:57,478
turn as Spock was fantastic. Also, his villainous
role in... the Heroes TV show has also sold

94
00:08:57,518 --> 00:09:01,700
me on this answer, I think he would be great
in the role. Yeah, plus I don't know, for some

95
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:07,362
reason, Zachary Quinto just seems like a DC
type of guy. Like he seems like he'd fit well

96
00:09:07,403 --> 00:09:12,585
into that universe of characters. Maybe because
I'm associating his co-star Chris Pine with

97
00:09:12,605 --> 00:09:17,287
the Wonder Woman movies, but still I think yeah,
Zachary Quinto would be fantastic in the role.

98
00:09:17,447 --> 00:09:21,188
Before we reveal the no prize winner, we want
to give a quick shout out to Brandon Estregard,

99
00:09:24,602 --> 00:09:30,423
and Travis Herndon for calling in and leaving
their answers. You guys all gave great answers,

100
00:09:30,463 --> 00:09:36,365
there was no wrong answer there. But the winner
of this week's No Prize is Andrew Shunk, who

101
00:09:36,445 --> 00:09:42,366
said, Hey guys, Andrew Shunk here. The person
who I think should play Brainiac is Damien

102
00:09:42,386 --> 00:09:50,429
Lewis. His acting in the movie Dreamcatcher
was awesome. His acting in Homeland and the

103
00:09:50,789 --> 00:10:00,631
show Billions, he can play a very smart character.
and is very cunning and has an evil side. So

104
00:10:00,691 --> 00:10:05,473
I think he'd be an excellent brainiac. Yeah,
I don't know how much of a household name Damien

105
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:09,774
Lewis is. I think if you Google him, you'll
certainly recognize his face, but he is the

106
00:10:09,814 --> 00:10:14,935
lead actor on the Homeland series, and he's
won a ton of accolades over the years and has

107
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:19,997
really been poised to break out on the film
scene. I think he has the look for the character.

108
00:10:20,097 --> 00:10:25,656
I think he looks hyper-intelligent. and sinister,
he would just absolutely shine in a Brainiac

109
00:10:25,696 --> 00:10:30,900
role. Yeah, he was not my first choice for the
role. But now that Andrew Shunk has given this

110
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:35,684
answer, I have a hard time thinking of someone
who could do the job better. You're right.

111
00:10:35,724 --> 00:10:41,488
He's not a household name, but I think he absolutely
has above and beyond what it takes for the

112
00:10:41,528 --> 00:10:46,952
role. If he was cast tomorrow, I'd be like,
oh, that's freaking perfect. Awesome. More

113
00:10:47,012 --> 00:10:51,228
perfect casting for this movie. So congrats
to Andrew Shunk for winning this week's No

114
00:10:51,248 --> 00:10:55,011
Prize. If you the listener want a shot at winning
your own No Prize, stay tuned to later on this

115
00:10:55,051 --> 00:10:59,996
episode when we'll be asking another question
of the week. And now that that's done, on to

116
00:11:00,016 --> 00:11:00,537
the news.

117
00:11:06,062 --> 00:11:12,484
Okay, so last week we got to our first full
trailer for the anime animated series, Suicide

118
00:11:12,504 --> 00:11:17,706
Squad Isakai. I had forgotten that this was
a series, I was thinking this was a movie for

119
00:11:17,766 --> 00:11:22,448
some reason, so that was a nice surprise. Animes
are known for their lengthy series. I'm not

120
00:11:22,468 --> 00:11:26,150
sure how long this one is going to run, but
it looks like it's going to be pretty damn

121
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:32,373
cool, so hopefully it fits good a long time.
Of course, Isakai is a specific anime subgenre

122
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:39,445
where the main character or characters travel
to a foreign land or a new world. In this case,

123
00:11:39,485 --> 00:11:45,170
it looks like the Suicide Squad is traveling
to a Japanese mythical fantasy world, which

124
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:50,474
is interesting. I've never quite envisioned
those characters in that specific setting.

125
00:11:50,895 --> 00:11:54,578
Yeah, it seems like it's just part of a plan
by Amanda Waller. Like she wants to send the

126
00:11:54,638 --> 00:11:59,942
squad there for some reason. I'm sure that'll
be a mystery, but the characters that are in

127
00:11:59,982 --> 00:12:07,347
this series look pretty badass, including Harley
Quinn, Joker, Peacemaker, Clayface, Deadshot,

128
00:12:07,607 --> 00:12:11,890
and King Shark. Clayface was a huge surprise
for me. Of course, he's a pretty prevalent

129
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:16,653
character in the Harley Quinn animated series,
as is King Shark also in this series. I'm really

130
00:12:16,673 --> 00:12:20,695
curious to learn more about why they chose the
specific characters that they did. It's really

131
00:12:20,715 --> 00:12:26,939
interesting to see how these characters play
into the Japanese archetypes. Seeing King Shark

132
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,218
as the big dumb brute is actually really satisfying
when he's in anime mode. And same thing goes

133
00:12:32,258 --> 00:12:36,640
for the gun-toting badass that is Deadshot.
And Harley Quinn, who's like, you know, the

134
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:40,662
manic pixie girl here. And that's what she always
is, but it just feels fresh when you see it

135
00:12:40,742 --> 00:12:45,944
in the anime style. Yeah, it's a hella cool
style. The voice work in the trailer is Japanese

136
00:12:45,964 --> 00:12:51,566
and it's, you know, pretty good voice work.
I tend to be more of a fan of the subs over

137
00:12:51,586 --> 00:12:57,009
the dubs, and we'll see if they have both as
an offering. We have no idea how we're going

138
00:12:57,049 --> 00:13:02,527
to be able to watch this yet. whether it's going
to be available on iTunes or maybe even Max

139
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:08,249
or another streaming platform. Crunchyroll maybe?
Maybe, maybe. That would be cool for anime

140
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:12,871
fans if it was. But sad for me because it's
another platform for me to subscribe to, to

141
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:17,013
review this. Because I want to review the hell
out of this. I loved Batman Ninja. Yeah, the

142
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:21,175
recent animated series My Adventures with Superman
was heavily inspired by the anime style as

143
00:13:21,215 --> 00:13:28,506
well. And that was great. I've yet to come across
anything DC and anime that isn't awesome. Hopefully

144
00:13:28,546 --> 00:13:33,251
this will be as well. Still not sure how everything
is gonna work out in this fantasy land, but

145
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:34,833
that brings us to our question of the week.

146
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:45,957
What is your favorite alternate universe slash
dimension for Marvel or DC? Yeah, there's a

147
00:13:45,997 --> 00:13:49,099
ton of them out there. For Marvel, like off
the top of my head, there's like, you know,

148
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:54,161
the Microverse, Kahn, Lunn, the Astral Plane,
places like that, you know? And of course DC

149
00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:58,464
with the Multiverse, you have Earth 2, 3, 4,
on and on and on, but you also have places

150
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:04,307
like Azeroth and Gemworld, the Phantom Zone.
Let us know what your favorite is. Yeah, record

156
00:14:32,558 --> 00:14:36,202
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and get into

157
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:42,169
the main event where we review Season 4 of the
DC Maxx series, Doom Patrol.

158
00:14:57,358 --> 00:15:03,103
Okay, so the Doom Patrol concluded its fourth
and final season last month. Despite originating

159
00:15:03,203 --> 00:15:08,668
on the now-defunct DC Universe streaming app,
the show survived a transition to HBO Max,

160
00:15:08,988 --> 00:15:14,953
finishing up on the platform now simply known
as Max, all while maintaining its dark, absurdist,

161
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:20,858
laugh-out-loud, funny yet introspective tone.
It's been consistently good in its past seasons,

162
00:15:21,179 --> 00:15:25,930
a show that I've recommended highly to anyone
who'll listen. And this final season, in my

163
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:32,493
opinion, was a worthwhile conclusion to an emotionally
beautiful show, albeit one that also defies

164
00:15:32,593 --> 00:15:38,295
the action-focused tropes of the superhero genre.
Yeah, if you're looking for an action superhero

165
00:15:38,335 --> 00:15:43,957
television show, this is not it. If you're looking
for weirdness, humor, and just saying what

166
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:48,299
the fuck a lot, this is the show for you. It's
a little bit more of a mellow, live-action

167
00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:53,801
version of the Harley Quinn show. Sure, yeah.
But better, I think. It's more of a character

168
00:15:53,821 --> 00:15:58,764
study. than an action series. Absolutely. Since
we'll be talking about how the series ends,

169
00:15:59,044 --> 00:16:04,027
make sure you watch the series, including the
entire fourth season, before listening further

170
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:09,390
because we will be going into spoilers. And
the way these characters' stories ends is just

171
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:13,592
so beautiful, you don't want to ruin it for
yourself. Be sure to absolutely watch season

172
00:16:13,612 --> 00:16:18,815
4 before listening to this review. Now if you
haven't finished the show, I totally get it.

173
00:16:19,035 --> 00:16:23,922
The release schedule for this fourth season
was as absurd as the show itself. with the

174
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:29,783
first episode of the season debuting in early
December of last year, 2022, and the series

175
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:35,785
ending almost one year later. I really like
this show, but I didn't even start watching

176
00:16:35,825 --> 00:16:41,526
season 4 until they started releasing the second
half of it in October. It's like, as HBO Max

177
00:16:41,566 --> 00:16:47,268
transitioned to Max, they forgot about Doom
Patrol and the Shuffle, which is super discouraging

178
00:16:47,328 --> 00:16:51,949
as a fan of the series, and I feel like there
has been little to no talk about it because

179
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:57,371
people simply forgot about it. With Superhero
Fatigue maybe unofficially setting in this

180
00:16:57,431 --> 00:17:01,893
year, it's especially bad for a show as good
as Doom Patrol to be overlooked or dismissed.

181
00:17:02,413 --> 00:17:06,455
Though with this review coming out almost a
month late, I guess we're as guilty as anyone

182
00:17:06,615 --> 00:17:11,097
for diminishing the importance of the show.
Yeah, I blame you on that one. We should have

183
00:17:11,137 --> 00:17:15,459
reviewed this like a month ago. Well, there's
so much that came out and there's so much to

184
00:17:15,499 --> 00:17:20,321
talk about. I don't know. Apologies to anyone
who's a major fan who's been waiting for this

185
00:17:20,361 --> 00:17:26,462
review. Because it's an important show. I think
it's so unique to the genre and more perhaps

186
00:17:26,522 --> 00:17:31,687
intellectual or at least psychological than
really anything else out there right now from

187
00:17:31,747 --> 00:17:38,174
DC or Marvel. I mean sure, the show has zombie
butts, but the show also makes you question

188
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:44,961
the humanity of the butt race. Yeah, the butts
are creatures that have shown up since season

189
00:17:45,161 --> 00:17:50,079
1. of Doom Patrol and I was hesitant watching
the trailers for this season, seeing them and

190
00:17:50,219 --> 00:17:54,080
feeling that they had kind of overstayed their
welcome by this point, like the gag had kind

191
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,981
of run its course. And I feel that about a lot
of the jokes within the show, like the what

192
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:03,263
the fuck thing was just so overblown. But as
the season progressed, I think they made brilliant

193
00:18:03,423 --> 00:18:09,024
use of all their long running jokes. Yeah, some
of them become definitely eye roll worthy as

194
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:14,406
we're now in season four. But I gotta say I'm
gonna miss them for sure. Yeah, for sure. The

195
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:18,630
show holds kind of a special place in my heart,
even as a Marvel fan, just for its uniqueness,

196
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:23,354
quirky. There's really nothing else like it.
And I'll miss it. And I thought Loki season

197
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:30,861
two went out with a bang. This is one of the
most emotional, powerful endings to superhero

198
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:36,026
television, television show, nay, any television
show that I think has ever been made. I will

199
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:41,175
agree. I think they went out with an absolute
bang. And I think they went out at just the

200
00:18:41,215 --> 00:18:45,999
right time as well. I think four seasons is
probably good for a series, especially one

201
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:50,563
that started to sort of rehash some of the same
storylines over and over. That was something

202
00:18:50,623 --> 00:18:54,987
I noticed, you know, each season kind of tends
to be where like, oh, they're facing this huge

203
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:58,630
threat and, you know, they become depressed,
but they kind of like rally together at the

204
00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:03,734
end and bring themselves together to overcome,
you know, whatever the threat is. You can only

205
00:19:03,794 --> 00:19:08,318
do that so many times. And I think they just
about hit the wall with this season. but they

206
00:19:08,358 --> 00:19:14,121
also do a lot to make it feel special, I would
say. Yeah, a lot of closure at the end, a lot

207
00:19:14,181 --> 00:19:18,583
of great resolution. Absolutely, and I would
also say this is probably the most existential

208
00:19:18,723 --> 00:19:25,227
season of The Four, in that, you know, thematically,
it revolved around mortality, which was appropriate

209
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:31,010
for a show in its final season. You know, the
stakes and threat of death felt more tangible,

210
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:35,933
because as an audience, we knew any one of our
favorite characters could be killed off in

211
00:19:35,953 --> 00:19:41,980
the final episodes. And it turns out a couple
of them were. Did you cry? I will reveal that

212
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:47,424
later. I'm not ready to. Fall my fucking eyes
out, man. Oh, man, I was not even prepared

213
00:19:47,564 --> 00:19:53,688
for how this show ended. I was not even ready,
but it got me so hard in the feels. And I felt

214
00:19:53,828 --> 00:19:59,132
like I was ugly crying, which I don't do. Like,
I wouldn't say I'm terribly sensitive when

215
00:19:59,152 --> 00:20:03,975
it comes to emotional filmmaking, but. after
spending four seasons with these characters

216
00:20:04,015 --> 00:20:09,219
and getting to know them inside and out and
backwards and forwards and the way the show

217
00:20:09,259 --> 00:20:13,442
said goodbye to the characters, I almost think
wasn't fair. Like they went so far pulling

218
00:20:13,482 --> 00:20:18,105
the heartstrings that I don't know if I'll ever
recover from this final season. Yeah, I mean,

219
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:22,047
they definitely pulled on the heartstrings,
but in a way that didn't feel manipulative,

220
00:20:22,248 --> 00:20:27,791
I felt. Right. Oh, it was totally earned. Yeah,
absolutely. It was a masterclass on how to

221
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:33,372
do a perfect resolution for your characters.
I think your words are really well said and

222
00:20:33,392 --> 00:20:36,895
I'm glad that I'm not the only one who cried
because yes, since you admitted it, I will

223
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:42,721
admit that I did as well. You got to be a machine,
a robot man, not two, I feel like. Now of course,

224
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:48,066
regarding the theme of mortality, you know,
the Doom Patrol this season visited in the

225
00:20:48,106 --> 00:20:54,352
first episode, the future and learned that they're
all dead without learning how they died. So

226
00:20:54,372 --> 00:20:58,510
when they returned to the present... You know,
they were focused on preventing that future

227
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:04,072
while also over the course of the season, aging
rapidly and having to deal with their bodies

228
00:21:04,112 --> 00:21:10,553
and minds failing them. As I get older, I find
myself growing increasingly nervous about the

229
00:21:10,673 --> 00:21:16,595
aging process as like my knee starts to like
not be a normal knee and just like hurt for

230
00:21:16,655 --> 00:21:21,936
no reason. Just weird random stuff like that,
you know, you don't even think about in your

231
00:21:21,977 --> 00:21:28,547
20s. Aging is not a graceful process. And I
think they kind of showed that in this show.

232
00:21:29,027 --> 00:21:33,269
Yeah, I think long-standing fans of Dynamic
Duel know that we started this podcast on our

233
00:21:33,329 --> 00:21:38,972
30th birthday. We are now 37, and there is a
world of difference, let me tell you, between

234
00:21:39,092 --> 00:21:47,277
30 and 37. Your body just basically wants to
die. Yeah, especially after a heavy night of

235
00:21:47,317 --> 00:21:53,459
drinking. But yeah, considering that throughout
the entire series, we're dealing with characters

236
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:58,622
that have lived over the span of decades and
have never aged, I think the stakes were sufficient

237
00:21:58,662 --> 00:22:04,244
this last season when their longevity was taken
away. Yeah, absolutely, absolutely. You know,

238
00:22:04,304 --> 00:22:08,446
their whole superpower has essentially been
longevity, or at least that was the main one

239
00:22:08,466 --> 00:22:13,888
that Nels Calder was sort of manipulating them
for, created them for. So for that to be taken

240
00:22:13,928 --> 00:22:19,254
away from them definitely changed the dynamic
of the show. And as good as this show is and

241
00:22:19,274 --> 00:22:25,357
this season was, it was 12 episodes, which was
probably two or three episodes too long, I

242
00:22:25,417 --> 00:22:31,240
feel. You know, past seasons have ranged from
9 to 15 episodes, and I feel like they never

243
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:36,862
quite figured out the right amount of episodes
to tell their story. Some seasons have felt

244
00:22:36,982 --> 00:22:42,245
way too short, you know, blame COVID for that.
But some have also felt like they dragged on,

245
00:22:42,365 --> 00:22:47,116
you know, just to fill an episode quota. Yeah,
season two felt too short, season three felt

246
00:22:47,156 --> 00:22:52,301
too long for sure. And I would say the first
half of season four actually reminded me a

247
00:22:52,401 --> 00:22:56,085
lot of season three. I was getting a little
bit nervous that they weren't going to be able

248
00:22:56,105 --> 00:23:01,350
to stick the landing on this final season. But
by the time the latter half of season four

249
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:05,234
rolled around, I was like, OK, they really hit
their stride in this season. And it's starting

250
00:23:05,254 --> 00:23:10,498
to remind me more of the better seasons, seasons
one and two. I agree. I agree. There were some

251
00:23:10,698 --> 00:23:15,361
early episodes in the first half, like Dorothy
Spinner's episode that I thought was great,

252
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:19,944
probably because I'm just a huge fan of Dorothy
Spinner. But yeah, I would agree that once

253
00:23:19,984 --> 00:23:24,567
the show came back from its break, the pacing
definitely improved. Yeah, I don't care about

254
00:23:24,687 --> 00:23:29,089
Cyborg playing laser tag with his friends and
all the dramatic bullshit that they're going

255
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:34,252
through. I agree. I agree. I think some of the
episodes this season could have definitely

256
00:23:34,272 --> 00:23:39,759
been condensed into half episodes. If only to
make room to explain events that happened off

257
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:44,461
screen. Like, I still don't know how Cliff and
Jane got into Orquith. And also, I would have

258
00:23:44,481 --> 00:23:48,503
liked them to have fleshed out more of Dorothy's
story, because I really feel like we didn't

259
00:23:48,523 --> 00:23:53,265
get to say goodbye to her at all. No, yes, you
just kind of disappeared after the Immortimus

260
00:23:53,385 --> 00:23:57,467
episode. Yeah. And I don't like that. I don't
like that. I would have liked to have said

261
00:23:57,507 --> 00:24:02,129
goodbye. Now, I may have felt differently about
the episode count if there was a little more

262
00:24:02,249 --> 00:24:07,668
action this season overall. I think seasons
1 and 2 had a good amount of action, though

263
00:24:07,708 --> 00:24:13,573
season 3 and 4 were kind of lacking that department.
There weren't really any big standoffs, I guess

264
00:24:13,613 --> 00:24:19,638
is what I mean. Even at the end, when we finally
saw Vic fire a laser and Jane transform into

265
00:24:19,698 --> 00:24:25,423
Silver Tongue, that battle was interrupted by
a bunch of singing butts. Which probably sounds

266
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:31,528
good on paper, since the vibe of the show is
more of a study of humanity than an action-packed

267
00:24:31,568 --> 00:24:35,499
superhero spectacle, as we've mentioned. And
of course, that's what I like about it, but

268
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:40,924
I'll admit the final battle felt fairly underwhelming
in a way that say like Ezekiel the cockroach

269
00:24:40,964 --> 00:24:47,149
versus a giant rat didn't. Right. Well, I mean,
the final battle was a cop out. How they resolved

270
00:24:47,189 --> 00:24:53,834
that with essentially two major antagonist villains
and threats of the season joining together

271
00:24:53,955 --> 00:24:59,339
and making friends and everything being okay.
That's a huge letdown. But you don't really

272
00:24:59,379 --> 00:25:04,432
watch Doom Patrol for action. True. Very true.
You know, the show did a tremendous job of

273
00:25:04,532 --> 00:25:09,257
wrapping up the character story arcs and felt
much more cathartic and satisfying than what

274
00:25:09,277 --> 00:25:14,303
we got from some other DC shows like Titans.
But let's talk more about the characters and

275
00:25:14,323 --> 00:25:20,570
their character arcs in our character breakdown.
Starting with Cliff Steele aka Robotman, who's

276
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:25,955
played by Brendan Fraser and Riley Shanahan.
Brendan Fraser does the voice, Riley Shanahan

277
00:25:25,995 --> 00:25:31,358
is actually the guy in the suit. The two of
them together combined make the character of

278
00:25:31,418 --> 00:25:38,001
Cliff way more likeable than the character has
any right to be. Like Cliff is a fairly frustrating

279
00:25:38,041 --> 00:25:43,244
character in that he reliably makes bad decisions,
even though his heart may be in the right place.

280
00:25:43,764 --> 00:25:51,369
But the final scene was so incredibly moving
and beautiful and satisfying in that Cliff

281
00:25:51,429 --> 00:25:57,903
finally got what he wanted. that I felt a profound
sense of loss once the credits started rolling.

282
00:25:58,043 --> 00:26:05,305
Like I was just sitting there in my bedroom,
just like sad. Devastated, right? Like how

283
00:26:05,325 --> 00:26:11,186
dare this show just end with Cliff's eyes going
dark, you know? That was the final shot. He

284
00:26:11,226 --> 00:26:15,808
got to see in that time crystal his grandson's
entire life play out and he was like, this

285
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:22,929
is me coming home and then he dies and it's
devastating. Like I was emotionally wrecked.

286
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:27,512
Like, how could they do that? I don't know if
it has to do with the fact that I have a daughter

287
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:32,455
now. And just thinking about her becoming a
grandparent down the line and everything like

288
00:26:32,475 --> 00:26:36,977
that and how her life is gonna play out, all
the joys and sadness and everything. It just

289
00:26:37,077 --> 00:26:41,920
destroyed me. I think things like that definitely
hit harder since I've become a parent. Although

290
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:47,443
I've been a parent for a while, bit longer than
you now. But no, I agree. I think that definitely

291
00:26:47,463 --> 00:26:50,585
contributes. You start to think a little bit
more about mortality, a little bit more about

292
00:26:50,645 --> 00:26:55,887
legacy. a little bit more about your children's
lives and how you could improve that and what

293
00:26:55,907 --> 00:26:59,768
you could do for them and things like that.
I think that was Cliff's whole arc this season.

294
00:27:00,408 --> 00:27:05,850
You say that you were devastated, but I wanna
make sure we were devastated in the best way.

295
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:12,012
Like we were sad, but it was a happy sad, like
a heartwarming kind of sad. My heart was warmed,

296
00:27:12,412 --> 00:27:19,786
but also shattered into tiny little bits. That
were warm. They were warm little bits. Yeah,

297
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:24,650
but no his arc, you know, he lost his arm last
season and he got a new one at the very beginning

298
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:30,676
of this one built for him by Vic and his father
Silas that had a sense of touch. Cliff created

299
00:27:30,776 --> 00:27:34,900
a hand puppet for himself using an ovedment
so that the first thing he would touch would

300
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:40,526
be his grandson Rory. But with him still suffering
from Parkinson's disease, he distracts himself

301
00:27:40,546 --> 00:27:45,710
throughout the season with other projects and
tasks and the knowledge and fear that he's

302
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:51,174
dying soon and desiring to leave some kind of
legacy for his family before that happens.

303
00:27:51,814 --> 00:27:55,877
At a certain point in the season, Cliff gets
so depressed about his mental condition that

304
00:27:55,917 --> 00:28:01,541
he gets suicidal, which was sad. But by the
end of the show, and like we mentioned the

305
00:28:01,621 --> 00:28:06,384
final scene we see, the fact that he finally
got his wish to be able to see his grandson

306
00:28:06,424 --> 00:28:13,329
grow up, and the fact that he's so at peace
with that, that he just dies, I think is the

307
00:28:13,389 --> 00:28:17,704
perfect ending. for Cliff. Yeah, at first I
thought it was a little bit tragic considering

308
00:28:17,965 --> 00:28:22,529
the characters got their youth back. They were
restored to their former vitality only for

309
00:28:22,549 --> 00:28:27,773
him to travel to Florida and realize that the
Parkinson's is coming to claim him. I was like,

310
00:28:27,934 --> 00:28:32,418
that doesn't seem fair. Like he's talking about
how he thinks maybe he moved to Florida to

311
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:37,502
die. But when it happens, it was beautiful.
Cliff can sometimes get a little grating over

312
00:28:37,542 --> 00:28:41,826
the course of the show, but I felt largely that
he avoided that this season. I think mainly

313
00:28:41,846 --> 00:28:46,109
because the amount of stupid decisions he made
was kept to a minimum. Even though he made

314
00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:49,952
some huge dumbass decisions like keeping the
butt alive and stuff like that, but it came

315
00:28:49,972 --> 00:28:55,556
from a very touching place, I think. So when
you can identify with Cliff's actions, he's

316
00:28:55,596 --> 00:29:00,840
endearing. When you don't identify with them,
he is super annoying. And I feel like this

317
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:05,583
season went with the former a lot more. And
you know, even when he does make mistakes,

318
00:29:05,783 --> 00:29:10,587
more often than not, they're accidents, right?
So like leaving the freezer door open was an

319
00:29:10,687 --> 00:29:20,196
accident. Breaking the chief's spine. That was
crazy. I was not expecting that. It happened

320
00:29:20,236 --> 00:29:25,301
so fast and I was like, wait, what? Poor Tim.
First of all, I was so glad to see Timothy

321
00:29:25,321 --> 00:29:30,346
Dalton back in the role as the chief. Right.
But to see the guy thrown into the corner of

322
00:29:30,386 --> 00:29:36,070
a bar was so freaking shocking. I couldn't believe
it when I saw it. But then even after that,

323
00:29:36,150 --> 00:29:40,412
you know, Cliff made the correct decision in
leaving Kim with his longevity. Even though

324
00:29:40,632 --> 00:29:46,274
he probably felt like that was another bad decision,
it was also the right decision. So it's stuff

325
00:29:46,294 --> 00:29:50,096
like that where he makes up for some of the
frustration associated with the character.

326
00:29:50,636 --> 00:29:55,318
Yeah, in the end, like kudos to the writers
and to the performers for creating one of the

327
00:29:55,358 --> 00:30:02,441
most endearing, yet frustrating, asshole, yet
teddy bear type character. Just a lot of conflicting

328
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:08,596
emotions regarding Kim. Just a fantastic creation.
I would love it so much if this show won a

329
00:30:08,616 --> 00:30:13,638
couple of Emmys. Like it deserves it, you know?
I don't know if it'll happen, but I would love

330
00:30:13,658 --> 00:30:17,540
it if it did. At least for writing. Yeah, I
think it would deserve it for sure. And you

331
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:22,822
know, some acting. Speaking of that, let's move
on to Rita Farr slash Elastigwomen played by

332
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:28,705
April Bowlby. I've said it before, but April
Bowlby deserves an Emmy for her performance,

333
00:30:28,845 --> 00:30:35,447
maybe more so last season. But she is consistently
amazing in a role where she has to perform

334
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:40,389
as someone almost constantly performing. Oh
yeah, her performance is just a masterwork

335
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:45,472
of technical acting. I'm surprised I don't see
her more often in stuff. Right? April Bullby.

336
00:30:45,612 --> 00:30:50,093
Because she just seems like a good enough actress
to do almost anything. And I wonder if she's

337
00:30:50,174 --> 00:30:54,155
almost too good in this role. I hope she doesn't
get typecast or anything and that we see a

338
00:30:54,175 --> 00:30:59,637
lot more of her now that the show is over. Yeah,
she needs to be in movies, I feel like. Yeah.

339
00:31:00,074 --> 00:31:05,177
Now after traveling back in time last season,
Rita has lived the longest out of anyone else

340
00:31:05,217 --> 00:31:10,781
on the team and took it upon herself to lead
the team, though early on this season the team

341
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:15,784
betrays her and chooses Laura to take Rita's
place as leader. A majority of the conflict

342
00:31:15,865 --> 00:31:20,788
this season for Rita came from her relationship
with Laura, who committed the ultimate act

343
00:31:20,808 --> 00:31:26,032
of betrayal last season in being responsible
for the death of Malcolm, Rita's lover. Now

344
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:31,872
I'd say Rita's character took a step back. from
last season and that she somewhat goes back

345
00:31:31,892 --> 00:31:37,556
to her self-centered D.Va personality. Ultimately,
as she says herself, she wasn't right to lead

346
00:31:37,636 --> 00:31:43,841
the team in battle so much as lead them into
lives beyond the Doom Patrol because she cares

347
00:31:43,861 --> 00:31:49,826
about them. And in the final episode, after
she herself dies, she disbands the Doom Patrol

348
00:31:50,026 --> 00:31:55,138
and is able to reunite with Malcolm in the afterlife,
which I was really happy to see. I don't know

349
00:31:55,178 --> 00:32:02,122
if I like the funeral pyre scene because I felt
it was somewhat disrespectful. But you know,

350
00:32:02,242 --> 00:32:07,084
as Laura mentioned during that scene, like there's
nothing really beautiful about death. Yeah,

351
00:32:07,185 --> 00:32:12,087
I mean, it kind of subverted the emotions that
the viewer was feeling seeing one of, you know,

352
00:32:12,107 --> 00:32:17,390
their beloved characters pass on. But it did
it in the best way possible in the show's trademark

353
00:32:17,430 --> 00:32:22,513
humor. And really, you got further payoff later
on that episode when you saw her reunite with

354
00:32:22,593 --> 00:32:29,287
Malcolm. I don't begrudge them that great bit
of comedy. Yeah, it was so good. For my money,

355
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:34,652
it was the best gag in the whole show. Definitely
the best gag of the season, I would say for

356
00:32:34,672 --> 00:32:40,617
sure. Moving on to Larry Trainor, aka Negative
Man. He was played by Matt Bomer and Matthew

357
00:32:40,657 --> 00:32:45,482
Zuck. We can't really see their performance.
We don't get any facial performances or anything

358
00:32:45,502 --> 00:32:49,245
like that. I would say, though, it's still a
good performance and that it's still moving.

359
00:32:49,682 --> 00:32:55,144
Last season, Larry nurtured a giant cocoon that
eventually hatched into an infant negative

360
00:32:55,184 --> 00:33:02,067
spirit entity named Kieg Bovo. After being forced
to abandon his prior family, Larry became very

361
00:33:02,107 --> 00:33:06,849
protective over Kieg, who seemingly becomes
angry with Larry after conversing with his

362
00:33:06,889 --> 00:33:12,011
future self in the first episode of the season
and believing that he may be responsible for

363
00:33:12,051 --> 00:33:17,653
Larry's death. With Larry afraid that no one
will be there to care for Kieg if he dies,

364
00:33:17,986 --> 00:33:24,151
Things become more complicated when Mr. 104,
aka Rama, enters the scene as a villain allied

365
00:33:24,191 --> 00:33:29,876
with Immortus to capture the team's longevity.
Though Larry and Rama find a connection in

366
00:33:29,896 --> 00:33:35,481
that they're both dying and can't harm each
other with their radiation, Larry rejects Rama

367
00:33:35,801 --> 00:33:40,485
after the promise that Immortus would grant
their wishes proved to be a lie. By the end,

368
00:33:40,526 --> 00:33:46,795
however, Larry regains his longevity and, deciding
that he is actually worthy of love, rescues

369
00:33:46,855 --> 00:33:52,039
Rama from the bottom of the ocean, and the two
seemingly merge in space with Keeg, the three

370
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:57,383
of them able to exist together as a ball of
energy or like a miniature sun out in space.

371
00:33:57,403 --> 00:34:03,828
Larry has lived up to his name as Negative Man
throughout the series, consistently being something

372
00:34:03,868 --> 00:34:09,452
of a downer, so it was nice to see that the
writers found a way to give him a perfect ending,

373
00:34:09,772 --> 00:34:14,775
like the others, like no downside. Yeah, after
spending a lifetime of going through so much

374
00:34:14,815 --> 00:34:19,337
shit, it was nice to see all these guys really
get the ending that they deserved. There is

375
00:34:19,377 --> 00:34:23,578
no exception. And I thought it was really cool
that he turned into a star, you know? Yeah,

376
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:30,641
very poetic. Moving on to Crazy Jane, aka Kay
Chalice. She was played by Diane Guerrero.

377
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:36,777
Normally- I'd be praising Diane's Emmy worthy
performance as not only Jane but other alternate

378
00:34:36,817 --> 00:34:41,481
personas of the character but we really didn't
get to see any of that this season and that's

379
00:34:41,521 --> 00:34:47,145
always sort of been like my favorite part of
the performance that is Crazy Jane. Well we

380
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:51,748
had the psychiatrist lady in the first couple
of episodes but yeah that quickly went away.

381
00:34:52,269 --> 00:34:58,333
Right. At first I thought Jane's arc here was
going to be a healing journey from the incident

382
00:34:58,353 --> 00:35:04,174
that caused Jane to exist to begin with, which
was sexual trauma when her boyfriend took her

383
00:35:04,214 --> 00:35:08,518
to an orgy and she had to defend herself. And
so I thought it was going to be like this kind

384
00:35:08,558 --> 00:35:13,662
of sexual awakening into a relationship and
finding her new purpose in that and kind of

385
00:35:13,742 --> 00:35:18,306
healing from the hurt that she felt previously.
And it kind of went that route, but it really

386
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:23,050
went about it in an awkward way with scenes
of like, masturbation that were kind of hard

387
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:28,054
to watch. Yeah, I think it was supposed to be
awkward too, though. You know, her arc this

388
00:35:28,074 --> 00:35:34,997
season was interesting in that Kay wanted her
to find a purpose for herself outside of protecting

389
00:35:35,037 --> 00:35:39,719
Kay. Because as we came to learn, Kay and the
Underground were healing from the ancestral

390
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:44,981
trauma that Kay had sustained as a child. You
know, but with Jane cut off from the Underground,

391
00:35:45,021 --> 00:35:49,648
she wasn't able to heal like the others. and
was left to face the conflicts of the season

392
00:35:49,788 --> 00:35:55,633
alone, attempting to mature and age in a body
she felt didn't really belong to her. And I

393
00:35:55,673 --> 00:36:00,617
think that's where sort of some of the awkwardness
came from. But by the end of the season, Jane

394
00:36:00,657 --> 00:36:07,423
realizes that K's body was hers, that it belonged
to all of the personas, as they also remembered

395
00:36:07,463 --> 00:36:12,387
the trauma they'd endured. And Jane was able
to merge with the other personas to form one

396
00:36:12,427 --> 00:36:18,307
persona named Kaleidoscope, or K for short.
and was willing to risk romantic love once

397
00:36:18,347 --> 00:36:23,531
again. It was such a beautiful ending for the
character above and beyond what I thought was

398
00:36:23,591 --> 00:36:29,335
possible, though I did think her relationship
with Casey felt a bit rushed. Yeah, but they

399
00:36:29,355 --> 00:36:32,797
seem like a good match for each other. Actually,
you know what? They didn't really have any

400
00:36:32,837 --> 00:36:36,820
chemistry at all, but I like to believe that
all of these characters kind of got their happy

401
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:41,323
ending, so I'm choosing to believe that they
were just meant to be. I guess they did have

402
00:36:41,363 --> 00:36:45,946
the connection that they both felt like they
weren't real people, so there's that. Moving

403
00:36:46,046 --> 00:36:52,370
on to Vic Stone, aka Cyborg. He was played by
Joyvon Wade. I've honestly never really cared

404
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:56,893
for this show's take on Cyborg, though I do
think Joyvon gives a good performance as the

405
00:36:56,953 --> 00:37:02,758
character. But removing Cyborg's tech is probably
the least interesting thing you could do with

406
00:37:02,798 --> 00:37:08,041
the character. And I think this season took
a little too long in getting Vic to realize

407
00:37:08,141 --> 00:37:13,665
he should be Cyborg. Like you, I didn't care
for the whole reuniting with old friends story

408
00:37:13,725 --> 00:37:18,878
arc. just felt like an unnecessary subplot,
but I guess having an old techie friend was

409
00:37:18,918 --> 00:37:23,442
a good way to introduce upgrades to the character.
I just wish that friend was an established

410
00:37:23,502 --> 00:37:28,126
comic character, like William Magnus or something
like that, you know? That would have been exciting.

411
00:37:28,606 --> 00:37:33,050
Yeah, I think like I mentioned in my review
for the She-Hulk television series, it's not

412
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:38,255
very interesting watching a superhero actively
try not to be a superhero, especially when

413
00:37:38,275 --> 00:37:44,858
that superhero is badass, you know? Right. Exactly.
I do suppose that having Vic realize this dream

414
00:37:44,898 --> 00:37:50,020
of giving back to the community as a mentor
figure was as satisfying a conclusion as the

415
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,801
character could have had, though a more perfect
ending, I think would have been a cameo from

416
00:37:54,821 --> 00:38:00,263
the Titan show characters, at the very least
a Beast Boy, you know, just like the cameo

417
00:38:00,283 --> 00:38:04,724
that cyborg had in the Titan show. Yeah, I was
expecting something like that. I was expecting

418
00:38:04,744 --> 00:38:08,945
that kind of crossover, but it never happened.
And so it made the crossover in the Titan show

419
00:38:09,045 --> 00:38:14,031
feel even more pointless and empty. Absolutely.
Especially considering the fact that, you know,

420
00:38:14,311 --> 00:38:19,235
this version of the Doom Patrol is an alternate
version from the one that debuted in Titans.

421
00:38:19,595 --> 00:38:24,698
But now we know that Beast Boy can traverse
the multiverse. So why not do it? Right. Or

422
00:38:24,738 --> 00:38:28,801
instead of the Titans, maybe it would have been
cool to see him graduate from the Doom Patrol

423
00:38:28,861 --> 00:38:32,844
into the Justice League. You know, that would
be a cool ending for him, too. I guess I shouldn't

424
00:38:32,864 --> 00:38:39,228
say boom. Booyah. Moving on to the final character,
Laura DeMille, AKA Madame Rouge. She was played

425
00:38:39,268 --> 00:38:45,900
by Michelle Gomez. The women. Actresses in this
show kill it. If you can't have Timothy Dalton-Snyles

426
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:51,863
Calder in the show, Michelle Gomez is a fantastic
runner-up. Yeah, she's fantastic at portraying

427
00:38:52,003 --> 00:38:57,586
the inner conflict of Madame Rouge. Oh yeah,
100%. Great character actor, you constantly

428
00:38:57,646 --> 00:39:02,488
know sort of like what emotion she's feeling.
Just with her eyes and her facial features,

429
00:39:02,668 --> 00:39:08,083
it's fun to watch Michelle Gomez give the performance.
Now Laura had a bigger role this season than

430
00:39:08,143 --> 00:39:14,305
probably any other character on the team. In
a way, I think she supplanted Rita as one of

431
00:39:14,325 --> 00:39:20,108
the show's five main leads. Not only was she
the team's leader, giving her more agency than

432
00:39:20,148 --> 00:39:25,170
many others on the show, but she was put in
positions such as facing off against Immortus

433
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:30,553
first or making others realize that they were
in an alternate musical reality that gave her

434
00:39:30,573 --> 00:39:35,563
more screen time. She questioned whether she
was good or bad as she continued to feel guilt

435
00:39:35,643 --> 00:39:40,724
over her past actions and I'm still not quite
sure how I feel about her conclusion, you know,

436
00:39:40,984 --> 00:39:45,726
where she essentially tries to burn down the
ant farm. Like, okay, that's kind of in keeping

437
00:39:45,746 --> 00:39:50,827
with the character, but was she successful or
did she go out in a blaze of glory and get

438
00:39:50,867 --> 00:39:55,168
killed in the process? We'll never know. I like
to think she was successful. She was good enough,

439
00:39:55,428 --> 00:39:58,629
I think, to bring that whole thing down and
the Brotherhood had normally needed to be brought

440
00:39:58,669 --> 00:40:03,324
down. In the end, I think she kind of transformed
into an antihero type character, which is pretty

441
00:40:03,384 --> 00:40:09,047
cool. Oh, that is cool. Yeah, I'll take that.
That's an acceptable answer. She kind of found

442
00:40:09,067 --> 00:40:15,411
that happy medium for herself where she's doing
moral good through amoral actions, like the

443
00:40:15,451 --> 00:40:19,593
Punisher or something like that. You know, the
Brotherhood of Normalcy and the Outfarm is

444
00:40:19,653 --> 00:40:24,135
an evil organization. They do a lot of evil
shit and she will burn them all alive with

445
00:40:24,156 --> 00:40:28,458
a flamethrower if she has to. I think that's
great. I think that makes sense for her. Yeah,

446
00:40:28,478 --> 00:40:32,861
and that sounds really dangerous for the character,
which is fantastic. I wish we could almost

447
00:40:32,881 --> 00:40:38,465
see her continue her journey. It was at times
frustrating seeing her struggle with her morality,

448
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:42,607
like when she would often bail on the team to
go drink vodka or something like that. It wasn't

449
00:40:42,647 --> 00:40:47,050
terribly exciting to watch, but I really chalked
that up more to the season having too many

450
00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:52,054
episodes than anything really regarding the
performance of the character. I agree. I feel

451
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:55,796
the same way 100 percent. But now that we've
talked about each of the characters, let's

452
00:40:55,816 --> 00:40:57,117
get into our story highlights.

453

one was titled Doom Patrol. Rita for struggles

464
00:42:11,598 --> 00:42:17,961
to lead the Doom Patrol now a superhero team
against a villain known as codpiece. After

465
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:23,323
the battle, Vic and Silas stone successfully
repair Cliff's robotic hand granting him a

466
00:42:23,403 --> 00:42:29,245
sense of touch. Cliff proposes using the time
machine to travel to his grandson Rory in Florida.

467
00:42:29,666 --> 00:42:34,769
But after colliding with Isabelle Feathers,
an amateur actress from their hometown of Cloverton,

468
00:42:35,029 --> 00:42:41,594
in the timestream, a malfunction sends them
to the year 2042. They encounter an older version

469
00:42:41,714 --> 00:42:47,718
of Vic, who reveals that zombified werebots
have destroyed the world and that the other

470
00:42:47,738 --> 00:42:52,562
members of the Doom Patrol have died, except
for Laura DeMille, who abandoned the team.

471
00:42:52,882 --> 00:42:57,765
While the Doom Patrol are distracted, speaking
with their spirits that now haunt Doom Manor,

472
00:42:58,306 --> 00:43:03,869
Future Vic tries to use the time machine to
travel back to the past and stop the Butt Pocalypse.

473
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:09,934
The team manages to stop him and travel back
in time just as they escape a horde of were-butt

474
00:43:10,014 --> 00:43:15,998
zombies. In the present, Jane becomes the dominant
persona of her body once again and Larry's

475
00:43:16,098 --> 00:43:22,682
new young energy spirit, Keeg, refuses to communicate
with him. Meanwhile- Willoughby Kipling meets

476
00:43:22,722 --> 00:43:28,944
the Knights Templar and learns of a prophecy
about the impending arrival of Immortus. The

477
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:33,725
fight against Codpiece was freaking hilarious.
Like they find him disgusting to fight, you

478
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:38,426
know, but like there's that part where Elastigirl
has to like point his gun away from the team.

479
00:43:38,746 --> 00:43:43,788
And so she has to like grab his crotch weapon
kind of thing and like pull it away. I was

480
00:43:43,848 --> 00:43:49,969
dying of laughter. I was rolling. I thought
it was funny when Laura DeMille went up against

481
00:43:50,009 --> 00:43:54,589
him. and her like crotch laser is tiny and he's
like just staring at it for a while. And he's

482
00:43:54,609 --> 00:44:01,835
like, are you trying to body shame me? It was
such a good moment. Trying to clear up any

483
00:44:01,895 --> 00:44:07,259
like time travel paradoxes or anything presented
here. I guess I do have a question in that

484
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:12,804
the Doom Patrol actually didn't do anything
to stop the apocalypse. It was the actions

485
00:44:12,844 --> 00:44:18,368
of that one scientist lady that taught the butts
to like musicals. Right. So why did the apocalypse

486
00:44:18,408 --> 00:44:23,095
happen in this future timeline? I guess the
only difference was that this team crashed

487
00:44:23,235 --> 00:44:29,137
into Isabelle Feathers while going through the
time stream and that created the Immortus paradox

488
00:44:29,297 --> 00:44:37,040
wherein her villainy resulted in a kind of cancellation
of the Werebup apocalypse, right? Yeah, I think

489
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:41,822
Isabelle Feathers has everything to do with
any kind of paradox. Her introduction to the

490
00:44:41,862 --> 00:44:47,225
timeline kind of threw everything for a loop.
I also really laughed when they crashed into

491
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:52,939
Isabelle Feathers in their time machine. And
Madame Rouge was like, oh God, she likes to

492
00:44:52,979 --> 00:45:01,283
watch people pee. That's right. It was such
a throwaway thing in season three when Isabelle

493
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:05,765
Feathers fell into that hole. It was interesting
that they brought that character back to be

494
00:45:05,805 --> 00:45:10,127
like, be the main bad guy for the season. Yeah.
It turned out to have quite the ramifications

495
00:45:10,148 --> 00:45:15,310
for this entire season. Oh yeah, absolutely.
The next episode was titled. Butt Patrol, in

496
00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:20,514
which Rita attempts to lead the team in preventing
the bleak future they witnessed, but the team

497
00:45:20,534 --> 00:45:26,800
rejects her leadership and makes Laura the new
leader to Rita's dismay. Laura and Cliff suspecting

498
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:32,124
Darren Jones, the former head of the ant farm,
to be the cause of the zombie chaos, embark

499
00:45:32,184 --> 00:45:37,888
on a solo mission to find and stop him, while
Jane and Vic pose as Bureau of Normalcy agents

500
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:44,878
to contact the Butt Hunter, keeper of the last
living zombie werebot. At the manor, Keeg brushes

501
00:45:45,038 --> 00:45:50,641
off Larry while Rita confronts him for supporting
Laura. Larry spills about Rita's leadership

502
00:45:50,661 --> 00:45:55,464
flaws and his desire for a good relationship
with Keeg, while Laura and Cliff find Darren,

503
00:45:55,684 --> 00:46:01,787
now a zombie farmer, whom Cliff regretfully
kills. The team reunites at the manor with

504
00:46:01,867 --> 00:46:08,331
Vic and Jane, securing the last zombie were-butt,
Frozen, which Cliff is tasked with destroying,

505
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:14,526
though he's unable to bring himself to do so.
Unbeknownst to everyone, One more were-butt

506
00:46:14,626 --> 00:46:20,448
lives in hiding with a former employee of the
Bureau of Normalcy named Dr. Margaret Yu. Now

507
00:46:20,468 --> 00:46:24,289
I have to ask, was like the butt hunter supposed
to be like a twin brother of the beard hunter

508
00:46:24,369 --> 00:46:29,750
or something? They didn't look similar but they
were both bizarre characters. I just love that

509
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:34,772
they exist. It's just freaking hilarious. Maybe
they could team up and fight crime together.

510
00:46:34,832 --> 00:46:40,793
Do you know if the butts have any roots in the
source material? I don't believe that they

511
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:45,847
do but I could- totally be wrong. I haven't
read like all of the Doom Patrol comics. So

512
00:46:45,927 --> 00:46:51,748
maybe, but I don't think so. The visual of them
singing and dancing was just so bizarre. I

513
00:46:51,788 --> 00:46:55,209
think I mentioned this every time we review
a season from the show, but like just thinking

514
00:46:55,249 --> 00:47:00,090
about popping someone randomly in the middle
of one of these episodes and see them witnessing

515
00:47:00,131 --> 00:47:05,792
some of the strangeness that is within the show
would be actually an enjoyable experience because

516
00:47:05,812 --> 00:47:14,114
they would be going, what the fuck? No, honestly,
legit. That is my wife who tends to pop in

517
00:47:14,214 --> 00:47:18,776
as I'm watching the show. I think it might be
just a little bit too weird and absurd for

518
00:47:18,796 --> 00:47:23,717
the average viewer, but absolutely when she
sees stuff from the show, she's like, this

519
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:32,460
is a really weird show. Moving on to episode
3, which was titled Nostalgia Patrol, Vic reconnects

520
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,221
with his old pals, including his former best
friend Derek, who calls out Vic for keeping

521
00:47:37,261 --> 00:47:42,467
his distance post-accident. Though Derek gives
Vic an old toy robot they built together for

522
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:47,669
safekeeping. Rita receives an invite from a
film festival showing the classic movies that

523
00:47:47,689 --> 00:47:53,412
she starred in, which she attends, only to get
physically sucked into the world of her films.

524
00:47:53,932 --> 00:47:58,874
To help Laura make amends with Rita for taking
over leadership of the team, the Doom Patrol

525
00:47:58,914 --> 00:48:04,336
attends Rita's screening, but also gets sucked
into the movies, though Laura manages to escape.

526
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:10,570
Within the movie verse, they meet Oliver Truman,
who reveals that Dr. Yanis is attempting to

527
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:16,792
drain Rita's emotions. The team finds Rita,
but Truman, revealed to be a villain named

528
00:48:16,932 --> 00:48:24,374
Mr. 104, aka Rama, traps them on the set of
the movie Spartacus 452. Yanis urges Rita to

529
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:30,896
save her pals, siphoning emotions for a mortis.
Keek swoops in, rescuing the gang, but Rita

530
00:48:30,936 --> 00:48:36,194
goes unconscious before they are all teleported
back to reality. This was probably my least

531
00:48:36,274 --> 00:48:41,457
favorite episode, though I would say that one
of my favorite moments of the entire season

532
00:48:41,637 --> 00:48:46,620
was the scene where Cliff and Jane were in the
horror film. And they're like, this isn't scary

533
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,182
at all. And then they're like, oh, holy shit.
When they like saw the kid, we're hiding in

534
00:48:50,222 --> 00:48:56,525
the closet from him. I do like when the show
kind of explores different genres in that way.

535
00:48:57,106 --> 00:49:02,950
literally taking us into an old romance movie,
then an old horror film, then like a 1970 sci-fi

536
00:49:02,990 --> 00:49:07,253
film. That's always interesting to see, but
yeah, the Vic stuff here really sapped the

537
00:49:07,293 --> 00:49:12,316
momentum of anything interesting that was happening.
Also my least favorite episode. Honestly, if

538
00:49:12,396 --> 00:49:17,099
I was Vic and I was around like those crybaby
friends, I'd be like, well, thought you guys

539
00:49:17,139 --> 00:49:23,504
were cool. Fuck you guys. And just walk out.
Yeah, same. I'm like, I'm a goddamn superhero.

540
00:49:23,524 --> 00:49:29,151
I don't need this shit. But also like I'm an
adult. Right, right. Whatever. Next episode

541
00:49:29,171 --> 00:49:35,216
was titled Casey Patrol. Sometime after parting
ways with the Doom Patrol, Dorothy has managed

542
00:49:35,296 --> 00:49:40,580
to reacquire her father Niles Calder's necklace,
which was used to keep him immortal in order

543
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:45,504
to conjure his spirit and reunite with him.
While staying with Danny the Street and their

544
00:49:45,564 --> 00:49:51,288
residents, she distances herself from the rest
of the community. One night, a swarm of cybernetic

545
00:49:51,408 --> 00:49:58,085
bugs invades the street. converting the residents
into robots, minus Dorothy and Mara Lee. Dorothy

546
00:49:58,125 --> 00:50:03,330
realizes the robots are the same ones from her
favorite comic book series, Space Case, and

547
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:09,455
manages to materialize the heroine Space Case,
aka Casey Brink. Dorothy and Casey explain

548
00:50:09,475 --> 00:50:16,021
to Mara Lee that the attack is orchestrated
by Torminox, Casey's nemesis who is also her

549
00:50:16,101 --> 00:50:21,665
father. The trio confronts Torminox in real
life, but Casey hesitates to take him down.

550
00:50:22,082 --> 00:50:28,103
while he manages to capture Dany and defeat
the Candlemaker easily. Later, Casey attempts

551
00:50:28,143 --> 00:50:33,525
to plead with Torminox, but he ignores her while
demanding Dorothy's necklace. She hands it

552
00:50:33,605 --> 00:50:38,746
over while revealing that she had never reunited
with Calder, and she was trying to distance

553
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:44,688
herself from Dany and the others to not be reminded
of him. After Torminox retreats with the necklace,

554
00:50:45,088 --> 00:50:50,109
Mara Lee gathers the community and implores
them to embrace the real world when they are

555
00:50:50,169 --> 00:50:55,741
ready. Casey and Dorothy decide to go to Cloverton
to find the author of the Space Case comic

556
00:50:55,761 --> 00:51:01,705
book. Unbeknownst to them, the author is working
with Yannis and Torminox and preparing for

557
00:51:01,765 --> 00:51:07,128
Immortus' arrival as the author tells Torminox
that Immortus might help them live out their

558
00:51:07,188 --> 00:51:12,952
dreams. Now, I didn't know that Space Case was
going to be in this season at all. I remember

559
00:51:13,052 --> 00:51:17,315
you talking about her going into your Danny
the Street backstory in their duel episode

560
00:51:17,355 --> 00:51:17,636
against

561
00:51:20,858 --> 00:51:25,099
Yeah, I was surprised as well. I was also surprised
by the origin they gave her and that Danny

562
00:51:25,139 --> 00:51:29,680
didn't bring her to life. But Dorothy did. I
thought that made a little bit more sense.

563
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:35,842
Yeah, I do love how Moralee kept misnaming Torminox.
She was calling him like TurboTax and Tampax

564
00:51:35,882 --> 00:51:41,483
and stuff like that. Yeah, that was funny. That
was good. How do you feel about Sabretooth

565
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:46,545
being Torminox? I didn't realize that until
the end credits. You know, he was covered in

566
00:51:46,585 --> 00:51:50,514
such heavy makeup and prosthetics. I didn't
even recognize Tyler Mane. Yeah, neither did

567
00:51:50,634 --> 00:51:55,215
I. I did like this episode again, because I
think I'm just a fan of Dorothy. So I'm glad

568
00:51:55,235 --> 00:51:59,676
she kind of got an episode all to herself, just
so we could get like a recap of what she's

569
00:51:59,696 --> 00:52:03,457
been up to. Even though, you know, the recap
we got at the beginning of the episode turned

570
00:52:03,477 --> 00:52:08,619
out to be a lie. I was a little bit surprised
that she ended up back on Downey the Street,

571
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:13,360
considering that for the longest time, she felt
that living there was a prison. True. Right.

572
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,001
I know she clearly felt that way back on him
again that she had just wound up in another

573
00:52:18,041 --> 00:52:22,126
prison. After spending time with the dead boy
detectives, I'm surprised they didn't just

574
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:28,108
have her go straight back to Doom Manor. Right.
Moving on to the next episode, titled Youth

575
00:52:28,168 --> 00:52:33,770
Patrol, Larry attempts to track down Keeg and
encounters Mr. 104, who has been forced to

576
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:39,951
host Keeg in his body. Through Keeg, Larry learns
that Mr. 104 was once a man named Rama, who

577
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:45,073
was constantly being experimented on by the
Bureau. As a result, Rama has joined forces

578
00:52:45,253 --> 00:52:50,359
with Yanis and pledged to a mortis. hoping to
reverse his condition before it goes out of

579
00:52:50,399 --> 00:52:56,104
control and causes a mass extinction event.
Larry pleads with Rama to find an alternative

580
00:52:56,144 --> 00:53:01,688
solution. Just as King returns to Larry's body,
a dimensional portal sucks him in and Rama

581
00:53:01,728 --> 00:53:07,732
follows in pursuit. At the manor, Kipling reveals
to the Doom Patrol about Immortus, who is an

582
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:14,317
ancient deity capable of eliminating reality.
He also reveals that Calder once spoke of having

583
00:53:14,417 --> 00:53:20,069
a piece of Immortus. which he used as a catalyst
for his necklace, as well as his experiments

584
00:53:20,129 --> 00:53:25,654
on Larry, Rita, Cliff, and Jane to retain their
longevity. Rita wakes up and finds that she

585
00:53:25,694 --> 00:53:31,579
is aging, prompting her to look in Calder's
office for a remedy. She breaks a vial containing

586
00:53:31,679 --> 00:53:37,303
a de-aging spell, which also affects the Doom
Patrol and Kipling. The team set out to find

587
00:53:37,343 --> 00:53:43,248
Kipling's mentor to reverse the spell, but the
team, driven by their youthful demeanor, decide

588
00:53:43,268 --> 00:53:48,700
to attend a pool party. Rita and Laura break
off on their own and finally make amends after

589
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:54,423
a tearful conversation. After talking to Jane
about friendship, Vic decides to go and see

590
00:53:54,523 --> 00:54:00,146
Derek, though he turns into a child by the time
he gets there. As the de-aging spell accelerates,

591
00:54:00,526 --> 00:54:06,110
Bunbury and the Knights Templar arrive at the
party and turn Kipling back to normal while

592
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:11,153
Bunbury proceeds to extract Jane's longevity
after she turns into a baby. I thought this

593
00:54:11,173 --> 00:54:15,127
was a great concept for an episode. For some
reasons, you know, seeing superheroes de-aged

594
00:54:15,167 --> 00:54:20,011
into their kid forms is always a fascinating
type of character study. Like with the X-Babies,

595
00:54:20,512 --> 00:54:23,735
that's what it reminds me of from the comic
books. That was pretty interesting. But yeah,

596
00:54:23,775 --> 00:54:28,559
just another great way to explore these characters.
Of course, Cliff, ever the tragic character,

597
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:34,243
you know, gets his brain de-aged while his body
is still a giant robot. But yeah, I thought

598
00:54:34,263 --> 00:54:38,287
it was interesting just hearing like the different
things that they went through as teenagers

599
00:54:38,327 --> 00:54:42,170
and growing up and stuff like that. Particularly
the character of Jane, because it was interesting

600
00:54:42,190 --> 00:54:46,694
that she never really had a child. That was
all, you know, Miranda's time, the former main

601
00:54:46,834 --> 00:54:51,779
dominant persona. So one thing I found interesting
in this episode as well was that this whole

602
00:54:51,819 --> 00:54:59,405
concept of Immortus as this like powerful deity,
of course, he's not that in the comics. General

603
00:54:59,445 --> 00:55:05,666
Immortus was the one responsible for the chief's
paralysis in the comics. He's just a bad guy,

604
00:55:05,746 --> 00:55:10,049
essentially. Not an all-powerful bink. It just
seemed more like the Marvel version of Immortus

605
00:55:10,249 --> 00:55:16,032
to me, who is a Time Lord variant of King the
Conqueror. It's almost like the DC writers

606
00:55:16,052 --> 00:55:19,834
got confused with the Marvel character. I was
kind of confounded by that the entire season.

607
00:55:20,394 --> 00:55:25,977
I didn't even know Immortus was a character
in Marvel Comics. Yeah. What a bunch of fucking

608
00:55:25,997 --> 00:55:32,541
copiers. Dude, obviously this show ripped off
that version of Immortus for this season. Like,

609
00:55:32,581 --> 00:55:37,354
what are they trying to do? They probably didn't
even know Immortus was a Marvel character like

610
00:55:37,414 --> 00:55:42,376
me. Obviously, they're a bunch of Marvel fans
that wrote for the show. You don't know. You

611
00:55:42,396 --> 00:55:48,898
don't know things. Moving on to episode 6 titled
Hope Patrol. After the de-aging spellers reversed,

612
00:55:48,998 --> 00:55:55,439
Cliff advises Jane to make the most of her remaining
life instead of pursuing Immortus. She visits

613
00:55:55,539 --> 00:56:02,081
a member of the Sisterhood of Dada named Fogg,
aka Shealy, and attempts to confess her feelings.

614
00:56:02,401 --> 00:56:08,004
But is conflicted. between her desire to live
for herself and her self-imposed duty to protect

615
00:56:08,084 --> 00:56:14,727
K. Larry is taken to the pocket dimension Orquith
by the Scissorman, mindless drones with scissors

616
00:56:14,747 --> 00:56:21,470
for hands. Rama saves him and takes him back
to the manor via a portal before Keeg intervenes

617
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:27,233
and takes both of them back. Rita and Laura
infiltrate the ant farm to learn more about

618
00:56:27,273 --> 00:56:33,335
the Immortus Project. but find its records missing,
having been borrowed by an inmate named Wally

619
00:56:33,395 --> 00:56:39,897
Sage, a metahuman who was labeled a weapon by
Laura in the past and also Malcolm's killer.

620
00:56:40,337 --> 00:56:46,759
They visit Wally's cell, but upon seeing Wally,
Rita panics and transforms into a blob, seemingly

621
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:52,961
killing Wally. Vic and Derek return to the manor
and pursue Larry through the portal, while

622
00:56:53,001 --> 00:56:58,402
Cliff convinces Jane to continue their fight
against Immortus. An injured Kipling arrives

623
00:56:58,442 --> 00:57:04,566
informing the two of them that Bunbury was killed
by Amortis' agents who took Jane's longevity,

624
00:57:04,946 --> 00:57:10,129
but they ignore his warning. Keeg reveals to
Larry his vision of the future where he was

625
00:57:10,189 --> 00:57:15,872
forced to kill the latter to protect the universe.
Believing that Amortis can allow the two of

626
00:57:15,892 --> 00:57:22,896
them to stay together, Larry allows his longevity
to be extracted. Meanwhile, Vic, Derek, Cliff,

627
00:57:22,936 --> 00:57:28,899
and Jane are captured by the Scissorman, while
they are greeted by Wally and two other Immortus

628
00:57:28,999 --> 00:57:34,783
agents. Cliff realizes that he didn't close
the freezer all the way, causing the werebots

629
00:57:34,823 --> 00:57:40,626
to thaw and get loose. Now there's quite a few
questions that this particular episode brings

630
00:57:40,746 --> 00:57:47,069
up, like the fog, aka Sheely. I don't understand
how she made that connection with Jane. Like

631
00:57:47,089 --> 00:57:51,972
all of a sudden a door in Jane's room leads
to the fog. Yeah, and how did she end up in

632
00:57:52,012 --> 00:57:57,163
Jane's puzzle? Yeah, in that earlier episode.
And why did she do that to Jane? That was weird.

633
00:57:57,744 --> 00:58:03,068
And who did Elastigwomen crush in that cell
if it wasn't Wally? Oh, that turned out just

634
00:58:03,088 --> 00:58:08,753
to be a creation of Wally. A false construct
of him. Okay, that wasn't clear to me. Yeah,

635
00:58:08,853 --> 00:58:15,758
I mean, we didn't learn that until later episodes.
But also, we never learned how Cliff and Jane

636
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:20,402
get into Orquith. Yeah, you have to kind of
just assume that maybe Flit took him there

637
00:58:20,482 --> 00:58:25,390
or something? No idea. And they even mention
it in a later episode. how like they don't

638
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:30,434
know how they got there. It's just like a throwaway
line. But the fact that they called it out,

639
00:58:30,694 --> 00:58:34,678
they should have realized that they probably
should have explained how that happened. Yeah,

640
00:58:34,718 --> 00:58:39,722
Laura and Rita had to build their own portal
generator using the notes that they got from

641
00:58:40,002 --> 00:58:44,646
Wally's cell in order to even get to Orquith,
which seemed pretty complicated, you know?

642
00:58:45,086 --> 00:58:49,630
Exactly. Should not have been easy, right? I
did like the fact that they introduced the

643
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:54,333
Scissorman in this episode, even though I think
it's a terrible adaptation of the Scissorman.

644
00:58:54,678 --> 00:59:00,079
Like in the Doom Patrol comics, the Scissorman
are very, very dangerous characters. They could

645
00:59:00,139 --> 00:59:05,281
literally like cut you out of the comic page
and then you just cease to exist. They're very

646
00:59:05,341 --> 00:59:11,422
different in the show. I did like how Vic's
friend was able to conjure up weapons just

647
00:59:11,442 --> 00:59:15,043
by drawing them and stuff like that. Yeah, that
was cool. Again, it would have been cooler

648
00:59:15,284 --> 00:59:21,305
if it was William Magnus. So that last episode
was where things ended with the mid-season

649
00:59:21,345 --> 00:59:26,990
hiatus that- It turned out to be almost a whole
freaking year. So episode seven entitled Orquith

650
00:59:27,010 --> 00:59:32,494
Patrol was where people started to get to watch
the show again. Rita and Laura escape the ant

651
00:59:32,514 --> 00:59:37,859
farm with Wally's drawings, though the former
becomes depressed, believing that she had committed

652
00:59:37,979 --> 00:59:43,683
murder. Laura later convinces her to help her
build a gateway to Orquith to help the others.

653
00:59:44,264 --> 00:59:50,349
In Orquith, the group manages to escape captivity.
Vic and Derek split from the group to find

654
00:59:50,389 --> 00:59:56,452
Larry, while Jane and Cliff go to find Wally.
They encounter Wally, who shows Cliff a vision

655
00:59:56,492 --> 01:00:02,314
of a potential future where he can be happy
with Clara and Rory, prompting Cliff to cave

656
01:00:02,654 --> 01:00:08,977
and willfully surrender his longevity. As Sage,
Torminox, and Dr. Yannis finish their ritual,

657
01:00:09,437 --> 01:00:15,319
Rita and Laura reunite with the group and they
are also joined by Dorothy and Casey. As the

658
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:21,442
ritual finishes, Rita is shocked to find that
they have summoned Isabelle Feathers. her theater

659
01:00:21,522 --> 01:00:26,663
rival who is pushed into a time hole by Laura
when she initially arrived in the present day.

660
01:00:27,083 --> 01:00:33,145
With the wardens possessing her, Isabel kills
Sage, Torminox, and Dr. Yanis, and unleashes

661
01:00:33,185 --> 01:00:39,527
a scream that destroys the Orquith dimension.
I was so pissed off at Robotman when he caved

662
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:45,709
and let them take his longevity. Yeah, rightfully
so. Like, he knew he was being manipulated

663
01:00:45,849 --> 01:00:52,117
and he still went with it. I don't know if it's
a result of his brain deteriorating, but I

664
01:00:52,257 --> 01:00:57,561
just hated it. The next episode was titled Fame
Patrol. The gang wakes up and finds themselves

665
01:00:57,621 --> 01:01:04,286
in the real world and follows a confused Isabelle,
who is discovered by a local driving by. Isabelle

666
01:01:04,346 --> 01:01:09,150
later gets on TV and talks about her return
to the audiences of Cloverton. Believing at

667
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:14,398
Mortis to have been a lie, the group returns
to dealing with their personal problems. while

668
01:01:14,478 --> 01:01:20,901
also accepting their mortality. Larry is contacted
by a disembodied Rama and helps him reassemble

669
01:01:20,921 --> 01:01:26,603
himself with Keeg's power. Cliff panics as he
attempts to find the zombie butt he didn't

670
01:01:26,643 --> 01:01:31,785
kill, while also struggling with his Parkinson's
condition as Dorothy attempts to help him.

671
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:37,888
Casey tries to be a friend to Jane, who is lost
in her own mind and unable to reach the underground

672
01:01:38,228 --> 01:01:43,835
and offer counsel only to be rejected. The group
later decides to attend a parade celebrating

673
01:01:43,955 --> 01:01:50,119
Isabelle's return. Upon arrival, the townsfolk
hails them as heroes, much to Isabelle's chagrin.

674
01:01:50,539 --> 01:01:55,942
Meanwhile, Laura notices that Isabelle has been
rewinding time to manipulate reality in her

675
01:01:55,982 --> 01:02:02,325
favor, and only she is able to notice. When
Isabelle finds out from Mayor Claire Delaire

676
01:02:02,586 --> 01:02:07,769
that the parade is intended to celebrate the
Doom Patrol finding Isabelle, she snaps and

677
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:15,204
unleashes another scream. It's never explained
why Madame Rouge is the only one able to see

678
01:02:15,344 --> 01:02:20,526
how Immortus is manipulating time. I don't know
why. Well yeah, and same goes for the next

679
01:02:20,566 --> 01:02:24,628
episode. How she was able to snap out of the
false reality too. There was something going

680
01:02:24,688 --> 01:02:29,470
on there, I guess, where maybe because she didn't
have her longevity taken or something like

681
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:32,772
that, I have no idea how to rationalize it.
But again, it was like one of those things

682
01:02:32,812 --> 01:02:37,654
that made Laura almost feel like she was the
main character of the show. Yeah. I actually

683
01:02:37,694 --> 01:02:42,056
thought the scene where Isabelle rewinds time
for that first time was pretty frightening.

684
01:02:42,216 --> 01:02:48,380
Like that was scary. Yeah. Straight from a horror
film. The next episode was titled, Immortimous

685
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:55,183
Patrol. Isabelle puts the Doom Patrol, Dorothy,
Casey, and Rama in an illusion of a perfect

686
01:02:55,223 --> 01:03:01,247
world where they live out a holiday in honor
of her, named Immortimous Day, and constantly

687
01:03:01,287 --> 01:03:07,322
break into musical numbers with help from corporeal
versions of the sex ghosts. During a number,

688
01:03:07,702 --> 01:03:13,027
Laura's old memory is triggered, breaking her
out of Isabelle's spell. She helps the others

689
01:03:13,067 --> 01:03:18,271
regain their memories, though some of them remain
uncertain whether they wish to remain in Isabelle's

690
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:25,637
perfect world. Later, Isabelle visits Doom Manor
and attends the Doom Patrol's dinner, but the

691
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:31,482
group renounces her illusion, leaving her distraught.
Isabelle returns the group to their normal

692
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:37,894
state while taunting that they are doomed. Again,
also terrifying. Not much happens in this episode

693
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:42,296
because you know they're all stuck in an alternate
reality, but I did enjoy the heck out of this

694
01:03:42,336 --> 01:03:46,278
episode. Yeah, I didn't know there was gonna
be a musical episode this season. It's funny

695
01:03:46,358 --> 01:03:51,300
watching these actors like sing and dance because
I feel like it gives somewhat of an insight

696
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:56,882
into the theater kids that a lot of them probably
were during their school days. Right. Yeah,

697
01:03:57,082 --> 01:04:02,465
Joyvon, definitely a theater kid. Yeah, Diane
Guerrero. Yeah, Abigail Shapiro, the actress

698
01:04:02,485 --> 01:04:08,755
who plays Dorothy as well. Brendan Fraser. Definitely
not a theater kid. Yeah. And same, I would

699
01:04:08,795 --> 01:04:13,276
say, with Michelle Gomez. Michelle Gomez can't
really sing. That was a little bit painful,

700
01:04:13,556 --> 01:04:17,737
but I think it's supposed to be funny. Yeah.
Out of all of them, I would definitely say

701
01:04:17,797 --> 01:04:22,418
that Vic killed it. My favorite scene, though,
was like as Vic was like doing his song, a

702
01:04:22,438 --> 01:04:28,160
dance number all of a sudden, like peace started
lighting next to him and getting interupted

703
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:31,561
as Cliff was just like, oh, I'm just trying
to fill my dick in the window. I still can.

704
01:04:33,534 --> 01:04:37,200
And then Madame Rouge opens up the door. She's
like, what are you doing? He's like, singing.

705
01:04:38,302 --> 01:04:42,649
And then that final shot with negative man coming
into frame down below. He's like, you okay

706
01:04:42,689 --> 01:04:42,969
up there?

707
01:04:46,378 --> 01:04:51,039
I also really liked the confrontation at the
dinner table between all of them. That was

708
01:04:51,079 --> 01:04:56,941
a really interesting scene I felt. The following
episode was titled, Tomb Patrol. After seemingly

709
01:04:57,001 --> 01:05:02,282
killing the last were-butt, the butt hunter
encounters a were-butt named Teddy, who tasks

710
01:05:02,302 --> 01:05:08,184
him with a mission. Vic meets with Silas at
Star Labs and asks to be upgraded into Cyborg

711
01:05:08,264 --> 01:05:13,754
again. Isabelle invites the Doom Patrol to her
one-person play in Cloverton. While Laura learns

712
01:05:13,794 --> 01:05:18,859
that Isabelle's source of power, the group's
longevity, resides in a skin tag behind her

713
01:05:18,979 --> 01:05:24,944
neck. She proposes to the others that they should
attend Isabelle's play in an attempt to recover

714
01:05:25,165 --> 01:05:30,470
their longevity, but they refuse out of fear
and wish to spend their remaining lifespan

715
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:36,855
in peace. Meanwhile, Dr. Yu returns home and
informs the where-butt Nicholas of Teddy's

716
01:05:36,895 --> 01:05:43,179
plan to start a war with humankind. while also
revealing that she had been turned into a were-butt.

717
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:48,960
Laura attends Isabelle's play alone, where the
latter is ridiculed by the audience, causing

718
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:55,122
her to snap and make them disappear. Laura talks
to Isabelle and convinces her that not everyone

719
01:05:55,142 --> 01:06:00,183
will love her the way she wants. Isabelle, however,
believes that she should pursue the path of

720
01:06:00,243 --> 01:06:07,325
villainy and gain love through fear. While reminiscing
their past adventures, Rita realizes that Laura

721
01:06:07,365 --> 01:06:13,005
has gone off on her own and tells the team to
help her. She then collapses and falls unconscious,

722
01:06:13,325 --> 01:06:19,089
leaving Larry, Jane, and Cliff to go to town
and help Laura. As they arrive at the theater,

723
01:06:19,349 --> 01:06:24,853
they are surrounded by Teddy and the Wherebutt
horde, but an upgraded Vic returns to assist

724
01:06:24,913 --> 01:06:30,257
them. The team runs inside the theater, where
Isabelle sends them and Laura through a time

725
01:06:30,297 --> 01:06:35,436
portal. These last three episodes were fantastic.
I really felt like they were paced well and

726
01:06:35,496 --> 01:06:40,659
the story really dove into high gear, leading
up to its conclusion. I did think it was pretty

727
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:49,784
gross that Niles's necklace that he wore was
a petrified skin tag that was on the back of

728
01:06:49,884 --> 01:06:54,967
Isabelle's neck. Like, I'm trying to think of
how that happened. Like, she was falling through

729
01:06:54,987 --> 01:07:01,279
the time stream and the skin tag must have fallen
off. in time, I guess, and Niles, you know,

730
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:06,464
managed to get his hands on it. It's just like
this weird paradox, I guess, of how Niles got

731
01:07:06,604 --> 01:07:13,450
his longevity from Immortus. And yet Immortus
needed that piece of himself from the Doom

732
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:19,195
Patrol members to return to time, essentially.
Yeah, it's kind of like a chicken egg situation.

733
01:07:19,635 --> 01:07:25,780
Right. Exactly. Episode 11 was titled Portal
Patrol. In the time stream, Keek manages to

734
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:31,939
detect three time portals. leading to different
longevity skin tags. The team splits up and

735
01:07:32,019 --> 01:07:37,582
enters each portal while Vic stays behind to
resummon them when needed. Laura enters the

736
01:07:37,662 --> 01:07:42,984
ant farm in 1949, where she attempts to steal
Calder's necklace, but encounters her younger

737
01:07:43,064 --> 01:07:48,806
self. After getting caught, Laura attempts to
convince 1949 Laura to give up her work at

738
01:07:48,846 --> 01:07:55,349
the bureau, but fails. Laura beats up her younger
self relentlessly until Vic recalls her. Jane

739
01:07:55,369 --> 01:08:01,391
and Larry enter Doom Manor in 1996, where the
former encounters Calder and receives counsel

740
01:08:01,411 --> 01:08:07,072
from him. After revealing that the other personas
are gone, Jane is convinced by Calder to admit

741
01:08:07,112 --> 01:08:12,694
the truth, that she and the other personas were
born after Kay was raped by her father. Upon

742
01:08:12,774 --> 01:08:17,775
acknowledging her trauma, Jane is reunited with
the other personas as they all ride Driver

743
01:08:17,835 --> 01:08:22,737
8's train out of the underground and to the
location that Kay was building as they see

744
01:08:22,817 --> 01:08:28,442
kaleidoscope images outside the window of Driver
8's train. Larry encounters the negative spirit

745
01:08:28,762 --> 01:08:35,244
who controls 1996 Larry's body to talk to him
and Kieg. The spirit assures Larry that he

746
01:08:35,264 --> 01:08:40,946
and Kieg would be fine in the future before
he is recalled. Cliff visits Paraguay in 1948

747
01:08:41,966 --> 01:08:47,348
and finds Calder and Kipling in a bar. They
briefly fight Nazi soldiers sent to kill Calder,

748
01:08:47,648 --> 01:08:52,889
but Cliff accidentally breaks Calder's spine
on the counter, causing his legs to be paralyzed.

749
01:08:53,354 --> 01:08:57,835
Redden with guilt as well as Kipling stating
that Calder will die if the necklace is taken,

750
01:08:58,296 --> 01:09:04,438
Cliff decides not to take the necklace. In the
time stream, Vic sends a distress signal which

751
01:09:04,478 --> 01:09:09,780
reaches Derek in the future who helps him locate
a time portal to return to the present day

752
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:16,123
with help from his students and a future Vic.
After the group reunites, Jane and a combined

753
01:09:16,163 --> 01:09:21,865
persona called Kaleidoscope does a pep talk
as they collectively agree to return to fight

754
01:09:21,945 --> 01:09:27,792
Isabelle. and the were-butt horde. What was
the more shocking paralysis scene? Niles Calder

755
01:09:27,852 --> 01:09:32,615
in this episode getting slammed against the
bar or Professor Xavier in X-Men First Class.

756
01:09:33,236 --> 01:09:40,140
Oh geez. I actually think the Robot Man one
was better because I kind of felt like the

757
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:45,463
first class one felt just so random, you know,
just like a stray bullet for Magneto tagged

758
01:09:45,543 --> 01:09:50,754
Professor X and it's like, oh, now he's paralyzed.
But with this one, I think it was. a little

759
01:09:50,774 --> 01:09:56,679
bit more not only humorous in a way, but Robo-Man
was definitely more guilt stricken than Magneto

760
01:09:56,699 --> 01:10:02,203
was. That doesn't mean it was more shocking.
The correct answer was Professor X in X-Men

761
01:10:02,223 --> 01:10:07,688
First Class. Clearly a better scene. Anything
between Doom Patrol and X-Men, Doom Patrol

762
01:10:07,728 --> 01:10:13,692
wins. Sorry. Okay, okay. The final episode was
titled Dunpatrol. The Doom Patrol prepares

763
01:10:13,732 --> 01:10:18,917
for their last stand against Isabelle and the
Werebutt horde, but Dr. U and Nicholas arrive

764
01:10:18,997 --> 01:10:25,226
and start to sing. prompting the Werebuts to
sing along. Annoyed by the butts, Isabel starts

765
01:10:25,266 --> 01:10:31,311
singing, causing the time portal to become unstable
and engulf the entire theater. The Doom Patrol

766
01:10:31,371 --> 01:10:36,996
returns to their home to celebrate, but Isabel
returns an hour later, having spent a thousand

767
01:10:37,036 --> 01:10:42,581
years in the time stream where the Werebuts
were helpful in her tour throughout time. She

768
01:10:42,681 --> 01:10:49,278
offers the team toenails, which grant them longevity.
Rita, however, passes away from old age and

769
01:10:49,318 --> 01:10:56,082
her ghost requests the team to disband and cremate
her body. Afterward, each member goes their

770
01:10:56,102 --> 01:11:02,526
separate ways. Cliff returns to Florida to reunite
with Clara and Rory. Larry and Keeg find Rama

771
01:11:02,666 --> 01:11:07,188
and take him to space where they spend their
last moments together before Rama's energy

772
01:11:07,248 --> 01:11:13,352
explodes. Jane goes to space with Casey and
affirms her feelings. And Loro returns to the

773
01:11:13,452 --> 01:11:19,996
ant farm and murders every employee with a flamethrower.
In the afterlife, Rita reunites with Malcolm.

774
01:11:20,416 --> 01:11:26,441
At Clara's home, while helping Clara with the
car, Cliff's arm freezes up and he sees a vision

775
01:11:26,481 --> 01:11:31,564
of Rory's future in the gift Immortus gave him
where he goes through similar experiences as

776
01:11:31,624 --> 01:11:38,209
he did. Feeling satisfied, Cliff's body finally
shuts down. A great final episode. For my money.

777
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:43,213
It's actually better than the final episode
of Loki season 2, which I thought was fantastic.

778
01:11:43,373 --> 01:11:49,278
If every episode of this season was as good
as episode 12 of Doom Patrol, it would be a

779
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:55,303
perfect five-star show because it was so satisfying,
so well done, so well written, so well acted.

780
01:11:55,683 --> 01:12:00,387
It was perfection. I don't know if this last
episode was perfect. You know, again, at the

781
01:12:00,427 --> 01:12:07,173
beginning, the final battle was kind of Deus
ex Machina in a way, but I would say, yeah,

782
01:12:07,273 --> 01:12:12,798
definitely the conclusion to all of the characters
arcs was above and beyond what I would have

783
01:12:12,838 --> 01:12:17,081
imagined for the characters and immensely satisfying.
At first my impression was that there were

784
01:12:17,222 --> 01:12:21,365
too many endings. It was starting to feel kind
of like Return of the King, you know? Just

785
01:12:21,485 --> 01:12:25,169
ending after ending after ending. Like when
I thought the show was over, I realized I was

786
01:12:25,209 --> 01:12:28,812
only halfway through the episode. So I was like,
what the hell do they have left to do? I'm

787
01:12:29,032 --> 01:12:34,970
so glad they took the time to really go through
each character's resolution though. Yeah. They

788
01:12:35,010 --> 01:12:39,333
didn't just cop out by having the show end when
Larry turned off Rita's movie or something

789
01:12:39,353 --> 01:12:45,258
like that. They really explored many different
epilogues of the Doom Patrol. And my initial

790
01:12:45,318 --> 01:12:50,303
impatience grew into gratitude at getting to
see where they went. Oh, yeah, absolutely.

791
01:12:50,523 --> 01:12:56,068
It made the entire season. And honestly, it
kind of made the entire series because the

792
01:12:56,088 --> 01:13:00,191
fact that we got to be with these characters
over the course of four seasons, through their

793
01:13:00,231 --> 01:13:04,610
different arcs, through their different trials
and tribulations. and just be with them as

794
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:09,554
they finally attain peace was one of the most
magical and beautiful things I've ever seen

795
01:13:09,614 --> 01:13:15,799
on television. It was incredibly cathartic.
It made all four seasons absolutely worth it.

796
01:13:15,879 --> 01:13:21,423
I mean, they were already great, but it just
brought it up an entire notch in my book. That

797
01:13:21,443 --> 01:13:27,647
all said, I don't think this season was as strong
as maybe like the first two seasons. I think

798
01:13:27,667 --> 01:13:34,050
there was a slight dip after COVID. So It was
great, not perfect, and ultimately, you know,

799
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:40,352
the show's existential, mortality-focused final
season culminated in a satisfying conclusion

800
01:13:40,512 --> 01:13:47,174
to this absurdist, humorous, and often emotionally
profound series. I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars,

801
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:54,336
a fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Yeah, I would
also give this season 4 stars out of 5. It

802
01:13:54,356 --> 01:13:58,917
just lagged a little bit in the middle episodes,
and I was almost about ready to give this season

803
01:13:58,937 --> 01:14:05,181
like 3 or 3 and a half stars. But those final
three, four episodes were just so incredible,

804
01:14:05,221 --> 01:14:09,945
so amazing that it rose up the quality of this
entire season. I'd like to give it a higher

805
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:14,850
rating, honestly, because by the time the show
ended and even now, I still look back on it

806
01:14:14,870 --> 01:14:19,974
with fond feelings. But, you know, just as I
was writing the review, I realized all the

807
01:14:19,994 --> 01:14:26,200
different balls that they had dropped, small
balls, which sounds weird to say. But things,

808
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:32,412
you know, like Dorothy's conclusion. Just some
plot holes that popped up in different episodes

809
01:14:32,592 --> 01:14:37,554
and some unnecessary subplots Just prevent it
from being as good as it could have been but

810
01:14:37,694 --> 01:14:42,737
still really damn good I think if this season
was six episodes like Loki season 2 was like

811
01:14:42,777 --> 01:14:47,260
the Disney plus television shows typically are
it would have been A near perfect season. I

812
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:52,723
don't know. It's a lot to fit in six episodes.
Maybe nine episodes. I could see that Yeah,

813
01:14:53,083 --> 01:14:56,785
I could see that too, but that does it for this
review guys Let us know what you thought about

816
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:13,608
Because it would just be mind blowing to me.
Yeah, that would be a tremendous act of will.

817
01:15:14,048 --> 01:15:17,950
Yeah. You gotta be like pinching yourself and
be like, don't you cry, don't you cry, just
