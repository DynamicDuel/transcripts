1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:39,020
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. I'm Marvelous
Joe. And I'm his twin brother Johnny DC. And if I

2
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:47,980
sound like ass, it's because I am sick. Yeah
Jonathan is sick, he's always sick, no one's

3
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,540
surprised. That's not fair, I feel like I haven't
been sick in a long time. You better get un-sick

4
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:57,040
because this is a big episode, in this matchup
we're going to find out who would win in a fight

5
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,640
between the teams of the Wildcats and the
Inhumans. Now I don't know much about the

6
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,380
Wildcats, but I know much about the Inhumans. And
they are one of the coolest, I think most

7
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:12,560
overlooked teams in all of Marvel and stupid
Wildcats are going down. Yeah, to be fair, I don't

8
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,740
know much about the Wildcats either. This is the
first time we're doing a dual episode in the

9
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:22,320
history of our 10 years where I have really no
reference for these characters because when I

10
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,860
first started reading comics, the Wildcats team
were published by Image until the whole Wildstorm

11
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:33,400
universe was acquired by DC Comics. Are they Image
or Wildstorm? Well, Wildstorm was an imprint of

12
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:38,620
Image. So they started out in Image, they went to
Wildstorm, and now they went to DC. No, they've

13
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:43,940
always been Wildstorm. I don't know what the hell
you're talking about then. Are they DC or not? This

14
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:50,840
is a DC vs Marvel podcast, clear this up for me. Yes,
they are now DC. Okay, thank you, that's all I

15
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,400
needed to know. But also, I don't fucking care
because I may as well have not even heard of this

16
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,740
team when they get their asses kicked later on this
episode. Before we get into that matchup, we're

17
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,360
going to break down the latest comic book movie
news that came out this past week, which there was

18
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,580
just one news item and that is it has been confirmed
by The Hollywood Reporter that Deadpool is going

19
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:14,040
to be in Avengers Doomsday. As always, we list our
segment times in our episode description, so feel

20
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,700
free to check out the show notes if you want to skip
ahead to a particular topic. Guys, our

21
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,600
artificially intelligent dual simulator, AJ9K,
has a quick message for our listeners, so listen

22
00:02:23,600 --> 00:03:11,880
up. Thanks AJ9K and thanks to everyone who
supports the podcast. Be sure to tune in to the

23
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,220
other shows and the Dynamite Podcast Network this
week, including the console combat podcast,

24
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:20,480
where hosts John and Dean simulate battles
between popular video game characters. In

25
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,140
yesterday's episode, the two determined who
would win between Colonel Volgen from Metal Gear

26
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,860
and Kessler from Infamous. Over on the Max
Destruction podcast, hosts Scotty and Gilly pay

27
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:35,200
your favorite action heroes from film and
television against each other. They're taking a

28
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,420
hiatus during the month of August, so make sure to
get caught up on their latest episodes. And on the

29
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,720
Send Joe World podcast, host Zachary Hepburn
speculates on fights between fan favorite anime

30
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,760
and manga characters. In his next episode, Zach's
going to reveal who would win between a kudosai

31
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,260

quick to the no prize. A no prize is an award that

34
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,340
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version, the
Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award that we

35
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,920
post on Instagram for the person that we feel gave
the best answer to our question of the week. Last

36
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:23,120
week, we asked you guys, what is your favorite
supporting cast in a Marvel or DC ensemble

37
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,640
television series and why? And we got two answers
for this because it was a horrible question. I

38
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,100
blame Jonathan. He's the one that came up with the
question. What kind of question was this? Nobody

39
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,660
wants to answer about supporting cast in
superhero television series. I mean, I do. Well,

40
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:42,980
you and two others, apparently. Let's go to and get
into our honorable mention before revealing our

41
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:49,240
no prize winner. Our honorable mention goes to
Lorenzo Valdez, who said, my favorite supporting

42
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,780
cast from a Marvel or DC show is the cast of
Smallville. Now, that cast changed a lot over the

43
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:02,040
course of 10 seasons. But if we're going to
specify, I would say the season two and season

44
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:09,140
three cast. Now, I'd give this answer just because
of Lana, but also, of course, we've got Lex, Pete,

45
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:16,620
Chloe, Lionel, Martha and Jonathan. Clona,
forever and always. Bye bye. Now, Jonathan, I got

46
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:21,700
to ask you, Kristen Crook, as Lana Link, overrated
or underrated? I don't know. Maybe somewhere in

47
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,940
the middle. I would say that Erica Durant's as
lowest lane was better. And I think it's kind of

48
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:31,820
evident how she became the fan favorite as the
series progressed. But I will agree that the

49
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:38,140
ensemble that Smallville had as a series
throughout its entire run was really good. And

50
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:43,460
particularly the early seasons, I was absolutely
hooked on. Like I went through high school the same

51
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:49,540
time that Clark did during that series. And after
high school, I kind of fell off with the show. But

52
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:55,500
I'll always have fond memories of Smallville and
all of its cast members. I remember liking Chloe

53
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:01,220
more than Lana had a little bit of crush on Chloe
when I was a teen. And hopefully the actress Alison

54
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:06,800
Mack is out of prison now. That whole cult thing was
really awkward. I think for all Smallville fans.

55
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,120
But a great answer, Lorenzo. The winner of this
week's snow prize, though, is Alex Albro. Who

56
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,700
said? Hey, guys, I think the best supporting cast
is definitely Ms. Marvel. You have Nakia, who

57
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:21,320
walks through life with Kamala and just has a lot of
shared experience and Bruno is kind of the

58
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,660
respectful shy love interest and supports them
culturally in all that they're doing and in their

59
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,220
difficulties in school and you feel real stakes
when the convenience store blows up and you're

60
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,660
worried about them. Not to mention her family, her
parents and her brother. You know, they add so much

61
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,520
to the story and the culture and you get excited to
see them and other things like Daredevil just as

62
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,580
much as you do the main character. So yeah, it's Ms.
Marvel for me. Thanks, guys. Yeah, I agree. I

63
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,540
didn't really consider my own personal answer to
this question when we first asked it. But I have to

64
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:52,660
say that this would probably be my answer, too. In
the comic books, Kamala Khan's family is a huge

65
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:57,580
part of her story. And the show was no exception.
There was such a good cast of characters, they

66
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:03,500
showed up again in the Marvel's movie. And her dad,
Yusuf also appeared in the Daredevil born again

67
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,200
television series. There's a reason they keep
popping up. It's because they're such rich

68
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,620
characters. Honestly, her family kind of made
that show. So it made me really like the show

69
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,740
because I'm not sure I would have otherwise. The
family was fun, but it also felt real. Right.

70
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:23,000
Right. They were funny. They provided great
cultural insight. They really gave Kamala a hard

71
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,080
time as she's struggling to be this superhero.
Good times. If you guys haven't seen the Ms. Marvel

72
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,780
television show, I definitely recommend it. And
then go listen to our review of it. But congrats to

73
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:37,020
Alex for winning this week's No Prize. If you, the
listener, want a shot at winning Giro No Prize,

74
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,580
stay tuned to later on this episode when we'll be
asking another question of the week. And now that

75
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:52,780
that's done, on to the news. All right, this past
week, it was revealed by the Hollywood reporter.

76
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,460
They have like a sub newsbeat that focuses on
superhero stuff called heat vision. They

77
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:03,080
produced a newsletter that confirmed that
Deadpool will be appearing in Avengers Doomsday,

78
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,800
and this was partially supported by their
sources, as well as Ryan Reynolds own Instagram

79
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:15,100
post, where he posted an image of the Avengers logo
that has a red anarchy symbol pasted over it. So

80
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,880
this is exciting news. However, the sources don't
expect that Deadpool will be joining the

81
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:25,020
Avengers, more like he'll have a minor role within
that film, which makes you wonder, like Ryan

82
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:30,640
Reynolds is a big name. Why wasn't he included in
the initial cast reveal? With the chairs? That's a

83
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:36,299
great question. It's most likely because the
character is a late addition to the script. Does

84
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:40,780
that bother you? A little bit. I like these scripts
to be finalized before they even begin

85
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,980
production. Otherwise, I think they kind of film
themselves into a hole as it were. And then you have

86
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:51,080
to deal with reshoots and all that stuff. But the
Marvel machine is always chugging along. And

87
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,540
sometimes they have to make quick decisions on the
fly. I think adding Ryan Reynolds is kind of like an

88
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:01,760
insurance policy, ensuring that people who are
fans of the Deadpool franchise will come see

89
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,680
Avengers Doomsday because Deadpool and
Wolverine earned a billion dollars at the box

90
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,880
office. That franchise makes money. And in a
climate where movies are making that much money

91
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,560
anymore in theaters, you want to ensure that
people are getting their butts in those seats. I'm

92
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,020
really excited by this news. I think Ryan Reynolds
is a marketing genius and him combined with the

93
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:27,880
return of Robert Jenny, Jr., whose creative
instincts, I think, are largely responsible for

94
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:33,840
the success of the MCU. Those two combined, I
think, will do really well for Avengers Doomsday.

95
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,760
Yeah, hopefully. I don't know how involved Ryan
Reynolds will be in the marketing of Avengers

96
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,660
Doomsday. I think it will largely depend on the
size of his role within the film. But that brings us

97
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:52,480
to our question of the week. What do you think
Deadpool's involvement in the Avengers Doomsday

98
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,020
story will be? Do you think he'll have his own arc?
Do you think it'll be just a glorified cameo? Will

99
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,560
he show up and say, this isn't where I parked my car
and then exit frame? Let us know how you think it'll

100
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,100
go down. Record your answer at dynamicdool.com by

103
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:21,060
podcast. We'll pick our favorite answer and award
that person a dynamic dual no prize that will post

104
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:33,440
to Instagram. Be sure to answer before August
30th. But that does it for all the news for this

105
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:38,780
episode. So let's go ahead and move into our main
event where we find out who would win in a fight

106
00:10:38,780 --> 00:11:01,440
between the teams of the Wildcats and the
Inhumans. All right. Wildcats versus Inhumans.

107
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,120
Why did we put these teams against each other?
Well, because our executive producers wanted us

108
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:12,680
to. And also it's not a bad option. These are both
really powerful teams. Yeah, plus both teams have

109
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:18,180
ancient ties to an alien race that has been trying
to influence Earth. So there's some thematic

110
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:24,760
connections here as well. Right. The Inhumans
have ties to the Kree aliens who experimented on

111
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:30,240
ancient man in an attempt to turn them into
warriors for their interstellar conquests. The

112
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,080
Inhumans are descendants of those experiments.
And a majority of the Wildcats characters are

113
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:41,000
actually descendants or hybrids of an ancient
race known as the caribam. Caribam from the planet

114
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,500
Kara. Sounds like a pretty interesting story. Do
you know who created the Wildcats? Was it Jim Lee?

115
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,840
Yeah, I believe it was Jim Lee. He was one of the
founders of Image and was like the main guy who

116
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:56,360
oversaw Wildstorm. That's how he got the job as the
publisher of DC Comics. Yeah, I like the look of the

117
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,960
team. Jim Lee is a great artist. I like the power set
variety. Both of these teams have a good mix of

118
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,660
different kinds of powers. And I think our
speculation is going to be a lot of fun just seeing

119
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,680
how these different abilities clash against each
other. Yeah, the Wildcats definitely suffer from

120
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:15,060
sort of that 90s extremism where they're sort of
like overly violent and all trying to be like

121
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:20,840
Wolverine. But they are pretty damn cool. They
were really popular in the 90s, so much so that they

122
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:25,380
even had their own animated series, which will be
much more finely remembered than the Inhumans

123
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:31,800
show. You're not wrong. Where did the Wildcat
series air? CBS. Interesting. Was it a kids

124
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,080
cartoon? Yeah, it was like a kids Saturday morning
show. I had to know how that got past us as 90s kids.

125
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:42,140
Yeah, we didn't really watch it. We were more Fox
and WB kids. Yeah, yeah. And sometimes

126
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:47,140
Nickelodeon too. One of these days, the Inhumans
will get a television series worthy of their

127
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,100
stories in the comics. But to explain the
methodology behind our duels, let's go to our

128
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,960
sentient dual simulator, Alfred Jarvis, 9000,
H89K, tell our listeners how you go about

129
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:01,520
determining a winner in our dual matchups. Yes, of
course, sir. The way I determine a winner between

130
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,680
the two teams is by running 1000 Monte Carlo
simulations between every character on each team

131
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,020
using their statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation
is a probabilistic model used to determine

132
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:17,060
outcomes through random sampling. In this case, I
randomize the statistics along a normal

133
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:22,120
distribution as a way to simulate the many
variables that can occur during battle. The stat

134
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,180
parameters are based on the official Marvel power
grid from which the DC characters statistics are

135
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:32,540
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are
included such as range, damage potential,

136
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,760
versatility and perception in order to create a
more detailed and accurate simulation. The

137
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,600
results of the 49,000 simulations provide a
percentage of wins for each character on both

138
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,280
teams. The team with the higher average win rate is
declared the victor as they have a higher

139
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:52,820
probability to win any given battle. In an
equitable pairing, neither team should win 100%

140
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:57,080
of the matches. The comic book stories have shown
that there's even a way for Batman to defeat

141
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:01,480
Superman. So the confidence rate of my method
falls in line with the precedents that have been

142
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,340
established in the source material. My
mathematical simulations are without

143
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:11,040
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for

144
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,640
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K.
Before we run the simulations, though, we like to

145
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:22,120
break down each team's histories and rosters
before improvising a scenario on how we imagine

146
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:28,020
one of the thousands of simulations would play out
beat for beat. And it's my turn to go first on the DC

147
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:35,200
end. So let me tell you all about the Wildcats. No,
long ago, Earth became a hidden battleground in a

148
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:41,320
war between two alien races, the immortal noble
caribam and the parasitic malevolent

149
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:47,160
daemonites. After a disastrous space battle
brought both species crashing to Earth, many

150
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,580
caribam assimilated into human society while the
daemonites sought to dominate it from the

151
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:59,400
shadows. Millenia later, a caribam noble named
Jacob Marlowe, known in covert circles as Lord

152
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:05,140
Amp, recognized the reemerging daemonite threat
resurfacing and assembled a team of enhanced

153
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:12,500
individuals to oppose it. He named the group the
Wild Covert Action Teams, or Wildcats. The

154
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:18,220
original lineup included Spartan, a synthzoid
with enhanced strength and tactical prowess,

155
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:24,720
Zealot, a deadly coat of warrior and centuries old
caribam, Grifter, a gunslinger and former Black

156
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:31,280
Ops agent with psionic potential, Maul, a caribam
human hybrid titanthrope who could increase his

157
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:36,280
size at the cost of his intellect, warblade, a
martial artist whose hands could morph into

158
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:42,480
blades, and voodoo, a young woman able to perceive
and exercise daemonites from human hosts. The

159
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,600
team was empowered and guided by Void, a
mysterious woman who could teleport in sense

160
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,980
dimensional rifts. Operating out of a
nondescript skyscraper in New York, the Wildcats

161
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:57,900
conducted covert missions to stop daemonite
infiltration and protect humanity from the

162
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:03,100
larger caribam-daemonite conflict. Early
enemies included the daemonite warlord,

163
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,680
Hellspawn, who had aligned with corrupt elements
of the US government and his lieutenant,

164
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,520
Hightower. As the team exposed deeper
conspiracies, they stumbled upon an ancient

165
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:17,880
caribam starship buried on earth. While
investigating it, the ship launched them into

166
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,980
space and delivered them to Kara, the caribam
homeworld. On Kara, the team discovered that the

167
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:29,920
supposed utopia was built upon the enslavement of
the daemonites and a rigid caste system that

168
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:37,080
persecuted hybrids. Disillusioned, voodoo left
the team. Marlowe, likewise shaken, stepped away

169
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:42,340
from leadership. Spartan, grifter, maul, and
zealot returned to earth, where a new Wildcats

170
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:47,600
unit had been assembled in their absence under the
Halo Corporation. Marlowe's front company had

171
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,600
quartered in a secure Manhattan Tower. This new
team, led by Savant and the caribam warlord, Mr.

172
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:59,640
Majestic, whose powers rivaled those of
Superman, included Max Cash, Grifter's brother,

173
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:06,119
codenamed Condition Red, the psychic cyborg Lady
Tron, and the enigmatic tactician, Tao. With

174
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:11,700
Halo's resources, the Wildcats shifted to
targeting organized crime and rogue metahumans,

175
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:16,880
using a sophisticated virtual prison system to
contain their enemies. Tao's manipulations,

176
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:23,440
however, instigated a massive gang war. The
original Wildcats returned to assist, but Tao's

177
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:30,000
betrayal culminated in an explosion at Clark's
Bar, a neutral hub for superhumans, also known as

178
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,580
post-human. The event fractured alliances and
destabilized the post-human community. Tao

179
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:41,340
faked his death by substituting a shapeshifter in
his place, escaping capture. Meanwhile, Marlowe

180
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:46,640
underwent a transformation, merging Void's
essence into his synthesoid body, renaming

181
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,620
himself Jack Marlowe. He took control of Halo and
shifted its mission from defense to societal

182
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,960
reform. From Halo's high tech headquarters in Los
Angeles, the new Wildcats released

183
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:03,080
groundbreaking technologies like
self-recharging batteries, clean vehicles, and

184
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:08,440
anti-surveillance devices that destabilized
global power structures. Marlowe employed

185
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:14,180
Grifter as his personal enforcer, alongside
agent Wax of the National Park Service and a

186
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:20,400
reprogrammed Lady Tron. Halo accountant Edwin
Dolby joined the field team as Grifter's trainee,

187
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,920
learning combat and espionage in the field. The
Wildcats confronted cyber assassins, corrupt

188
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:32,460
government agencies, and rogue Cota operative.
Zellet, thought dead, was rescued by Grifter's

189
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:37,740
strike team from a hidden mountain monastery.
Internal conflicts simmered when war, one of

190
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:43,130
Marlowe's advisors, attempted to ease Halo's
extra-dimensional energy for himself. Marlowe

191
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:48,470
stopped him, ensuring Halo's continued
dominance as a force for change. During the World

192
00:18:48,470 --> 00:18:54,130
Storm era, after DC acquired the Wildstorm
characters, the Wildcats regrouped to face a

193
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:59,950
reemergent Daemonite threat as Hellspawn's
allied with Kaizen Gamora. Marlowe gathered

194
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:06,010
Zellet, Grifter, Voodoo, Savant, Lady Tron, and
Mr. Majestic, and their headquarters became a

195
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:11,370
Halo-powered orbital station. Warblade
operated undercover, and Marlowe remained in

196
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:17,950
retirement. Shortly after a global catastrophe
struck, an event known as World's End. The moon

197
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:23,170
shattered, Earth's magnetic field
destabilized, and civilization collapsed. The

198
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:29,150
Halo building in Los Angeles survived, however,
as its batteries kept lights and hope alive. With

199
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:34,170
Void's power gone from Spartan, now called
Hadrian, the team focused on humanitarian

200
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:40,390
relief. They rescued survivors, fended off
scavengers, and turned Halo into a safe haven.

201
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:45,510
Majestic established a breakaway caribbean
enclave in Hawaii and began raiding Halo's

202
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:50,950
supplies. Tensions escalated, but eased after an
uneasy truce allowed survivors to migrate to

203
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:56,370
Majestic's colony. New tensions emerged when the
Wildcats learned Majestic was harvesting DNA

204
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:03,410
from cactives, including Savant, to create a
genetically superior caribbean race. Nemesis, a

205
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:09,110
sword-wielding caribbean warrior, sacrificed
herself to destroy the facility. At the same time,

206
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:15,890
Lord Defile, a daemonite warlord, broke the peace
and led in an assault on Halo. The team opened a

207
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:21,110
gateway to other space, sacrificing their
building and themselves to eliminate both Defile

208
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:27,550
and Majestic's threat. Surviving members
regrouped with John Lynch of Team 7 to oppose Tau

209
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:34,690
once more. Now wielding cosmic power stolen from
Void and Providence, Tau sought Godhood. Their

210
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:40,470
efforts failed until a final confrontation on a
remote island where Max Faraday, holder of the

211
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:46,990
Creation equation, had gone into hiding. Tau
reached the equation and altered reality, but

212
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:52,290
Lady Tron had memorized the formula and helped the
heroes regain control. In a surreal

213
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:58,250
psychological realm, Grifter confronted Tau's
inner Void, his inability to feel connection or

214
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:03,990
love. The confrontation weakened Tau, who was
then shot and killed by Grifter. Faraday

215
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:10,050
entrusted the heroes with new uniforms and tasked
them with rebuilding the world. In DC's

216
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:15,710
post-Flashpoint continuity, the Wildcats were
reimagined as a secret strike force operated by

217
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:20,910
the Halo Corporation to battle global
corruption. The team's new focus was to dismantle

218
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:26,190
clandestine organizations threatening Earth
stability, particularly the mysterious

219
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:32,750
Leviathan. Grifter, masquerading as his dead
brother Max Cash, infiltrated Leviathan to steal

220
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,930
classified intelligence. Operating once again
from the Halo building in Los Angeles, the team

221
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:44,430
composed of Grifter, Zella, Tavudu, and a newly
upgraded Lady Tron, targeted Leviathan's assets

222
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:50,030
and clashed with other global players, including
the Corps of Owls and secret divisions within

223
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:55,610
Wayne Enterprises. You can of course learn more
about the Corps of Owls in our Talon versus Niko

224
00:21:55,610 --> 00:22:01,150
Minoru duel. Grifter's infiltration led to
confrontations with both Batman and Superman,

225
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:06,590
who viewed the Wildcats methods as reckless and
destabilizing. Despite opposition, the team

226
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:11,770
succeeded in extracting critical data and
neutralizing a Leviathan strike team sent to

227
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:16,810
eliminate them. After dismantling one of
Leviathan's black sites in Egypt, the Wildcats

228
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:21,910
traced a metahuman trafficking gang to Eastern
Europe, where they discovered Daemonite genetic

229
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:27,790
experiments being funded by remnants of Gamora's
elite. Halo launched a covert rescue operation

230
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:32,730
that liberated several hybrid children,
prompting Zella to re-establish her coda

231
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:38,330
contacts in the Balkans for sanctuary.
Meanwhile, Grifter continued posing as Max Cash

232
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:44,270
to infiltrate a rogue Leviathan cell embedded
within Spiral, clashing with agents loyal to both

233
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:50,550
checkmate and trust. During a raid in Gotham, Lady
Tron engaged a nanai augmented assassin

234
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:55,890
dispatched by the Corps of Owls, confirming
rumors of their expanded influence. Following

235
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:00,690
these developments, the Wildcats relocated
their operations to a fortified Halo facility

236
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:05,830
beneath the Pacific Ocean, where they began
investigating dimensional anomalies linked to

237
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:10,950
the return of Void's energy signatures,
suggesting a resurgence of the energy once

238
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:17,350
believed lost. Now for my seven person roster, I
went with the original team that was also featured

239
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:24,830
in the animated series, specifically Spartan,
Warblade, Void, Voodoo, Maul, Grifter, and

240
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:30,910
Zealot, which I also think presents a good balance
against the inhumans. To go into a bit of detail on

241
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:35,810
each character once again, Spartan, the caribam
android leader of the team and essentially the

242
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:41,290
Superman of the group, has enhanced strength,
durability and senses, as well as flight and

243
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:47,550
bioplasma energy emission, among other android
skills like technopathy and cloaking fields.

244
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:53,230
Zealot, a centuries old blade wielding Kota
warrior, has enhanced caribam physiology that

245
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:58,810
grants superhuman strength, durability, senses
and a healing factor. She's like Wolverine.

246
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:04,350
Voodoo is a caribam daemonite human hybrid with
enhanced physicals, particularly when she

247
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:09,090
shapeshifts into a demonic daemonite form,
though she also has psychic level perception

248
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:15,410
known as Sight. The ability to freeze time for
short periods and she's a practitioner of voodoo

249
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:22,430
magic who can raise zombies. Maul, a member of a
caribam subspecies known as a Titanthrope, is a

250
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:28,070
Nobel Prize winning biochemist who can grow
exponentially in size and strength, though at the

251
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:34,770
cost of his intelligence. Warblade, a caribam
subspecies hybrid known as a Shaper, can convert

252
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:40,530
his body into a metallic substance that he can
stretch and shape at will, often into bladed

253
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:47,710
weapons. A non-caribam related member of my team
is Void, a powerful manipulator of space time with

254
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:53,810
abilities like teleportation, precognition,
telekinesis, time travel and quantum energy

255
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:59,170
emission. And finally, Grifter, probably the
most popular member of the team, is a

256
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:04,790
sharpshooting tactician, martial artist and
demolitions expert whose exposure to modified

257
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:11,670
alien DNA known as Gen Factor grants him
telepathy, telekinesis and a healing factor. And

258
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,310
that's the Wildcats. As you're going through
their backstory, I thought of something I hadn't

259
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:24,270
thought before, is the name of Wildstorm, a
portmanteau of the Wildcats and Stormwatch?

260
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:29,730
Probably? Cool. Thank you for that insight.
That's a pretty interesting story, at least the

261
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:36,230
first arc, as with any long running team, the first
arc is usually the best. And then because writers

262
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:40,690
got to keep things going, they kind of lose their
original focus. But I like the idea of how they

263
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:46,750
started out very similarly to the Inhumans, where
you have warring alien races fighting and

264
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:51,870
involving humanity and having superpowered
beings stem from that. Great pairing. The

265
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:56,390
executive producers probably already knew of
this thematic tie-in. That's why it's great to

266
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:02,230
have multiple minds pulled together in the
formation of these duels. Absolutely. Never

267
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:06,290
would have thought of this match. But I'm really
glad that we're doing it. Well, let me get into the

268
00:26:06,290 --> 00:26:11,430
Inhumans backstory. The Inhumans are
descendants of a group of ancient humans

269
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:17,590
genetically experimented on by the alien race
known as the Kree. Tens of thousands of years ago,

270
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:23,110
the Kree spliced their own DNA into primitive man,
hoping to create a superpowered race that could

271
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:28,550
serve as soldiers in their interstellar wars.
Eventually, the Kree abandoned the project where

272
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:34,970
it was lost to time. But the altered humans, now
Inhumans, remained. Carrying with them a dormant

273
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:40,010
potential through their Kree modified DNA.
Generations later, these early Inhumans

274
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:45,290
discovered a strange extraterrestrial
substance developed by the Kree called pterogen.

275
00:26:45,290 --> 00:26:50,130
When refined into the pterogen mists, it would
activate their latent genetic enhancements and

276
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:55,870
grant them extraordinary powers, a process known
as pterogenesis. Isolating themselves from the

277
00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:00,630
outside world and their more primitive human
counterparts, the Inhumans built a hidden city

278
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:06,590
called Adalan, where they formed a superpowered
society governed by a monarchy obsessed with

279
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:12,130
genetics. Their culture developed into a strict
caste system, where the most successful results

280
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:17,350
of pterogenesis rose in prominence and
culminated in the royal family. However,

281
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:23,030
pterogenesis was unpredictable and in rare cases
had catastrophic results. Those who emerged from

282
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:28,790
the mists as deformed, subhuman throwbacks were
called alpha primitives. They were condemned to a

283
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:33,750
lower caste forced to live underground. This
harsh system cemented the Inhumans genetic

284
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:38,610
hierarchy, elevating the most gifted to the royal
palace while relegating the most unfortunate

285
00:27:38,610 --> 00:27:44,590
underground. A strict human genetics council, a
12 member body chaired by the king, regulated

286
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:51,070
pterogenesis, mapped family lines and even
approved marriages. In the 20th century, King

287
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:57,090
Aegon, regarded as one of Adalan's greatest
rulers, convinced his wife Rhinda to expose their

288
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:02,810
unborn child to pterogenesis while she was
pregnant, defying the genetic council. Their

289
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:09,370
son, Blackaggar Boltagon, aka Blackbolt, was
born with a voice so destructive that even a

290
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:14,830
whisper could level a city. He was raised in
isolation to master absolute control over his

291
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:20,070
ability. Young Blackbolt was betrothed to his
cousin Medusa, whose hair moved with strength and

292
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:25,230
precision and obeyed her will. King Aegon then
secretly urged relatives to expose their infants

293
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:30,710
early, producing a remarkable generation of
Inhumans, including Maximus, Blackbolt's

294
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:36,410
brother who was brilliant but unstable, Gorgon,
whose hooves could unleash earthquakes. Triton

295
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:42,830
drastically altered into an aquatic beast,
Crystal, who commanded the elements, and Karnak,

296
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:49,340
who never underwent any of the But heavily trained
to see the flaw in any object, tactic, or system.

297
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:54,180
Finally, there was Lockjaw, a massive canine who
was bonded to the royal family who could teleport

298
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,660
to nearly anywhere. You can learn more about
Blackbolt, Medusa, and Crystal in their

299
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:04,260
respective dual episodes against Shazam,
Long-Gated Man, and Tempest. As humanity spread

300
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:09,480
over the earth, the Inhuman's secret existence
came under threat. They at times clashed with

301
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:14,040
frightened humans and suppressed alpha
primitive revolts, but they also formed ties with

302
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:19,280
Earth's heroes such as the Fantastic Four and
sometimes even fought beside them. Inside

303
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:26,080
Adolan, Maximus schemed to take the throne using
devices, riots, and manipulation. Adolan

304
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,820
endured kidnappings, invasions, and cycles of
destruction and rebuilding. Eventually, the

305
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:37,740
world learned that this hidden race existed, and
Adolan was moved off of Earth to the blue area of the

306
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:43,580
moon. Blackbolt's reign faced a personal crisis
when he and Medusa conceived a child. The genetics

307
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:49,340
council, fearing his bloodline, seized the
infant and cut off parental contact. Medusa fled

308
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:54,000
to Earth with members of the family while Maximus
hounded them. When Blackbolt learned the council

309
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,440
planned to use his son in his scheme against him, he
turned on the council. He set aside the crown for a

310
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,820
time, and the royals lived away from Adolan,
returning when their people needed them.

311
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:09,420
Eventually, Adolan returned to Earth, isolated
in the Himalayan Mountains. The Kree later

312
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:15,360
returned to claim their rediscovered subjects.
Ronan the Accuser struck from orbit, enslaving

313
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,420
the Inhumans and forcing Blackbolt to lead
missions against their rival alien empires,

314
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:25,480
including the Shiar. He exiled Maximus and the
alpha primitives to the negative zone and

315
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,380
revealed that the Inhumans had been designed for
infiltration. Their traits meant to echo alien

316
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:35,920
forms for espionage and assassination. He used
them to sabotage ships and treaties and tried to

317
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,840
force Blackbolt to assassinate the Shiar
Empress. Blackbolt challenged Ronan to an honor

318
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:47,100
duel, won, and forced Ronan to withdraw. Later,
back on Earth, Crystal's husband, Quicksilver,

319
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:53,620
stole pterogen crystals in an attempt to regain
his lost powers and help other depowered mutants.

320
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:58,320
You can learn more about this in our Quicksilver
vs. Flash duel episode. The United States

321
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,000
government seized the pterogen crystals and
Blackbolt declared war, pending their return. A

322
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,140
strike to recover them caused many human deaths
and hardened the world's opinion against

323
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:13,100
Adaline. Though the crystals were finally
reclaimed, Maximus seized control and Adaline

324
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:17,760
suffered devastating ruin. Not long after,
Blackbolt was kidnapped and replaced by an

325
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,640
imposter from the Skrulls, a shapeshifting alien
race. The royal family, aided by the Kree, rescued

326
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:28,360
Blackbolt from Skrull captivity and returned
home. Seeking to escape the strife from the

327
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:33,320
outside world once and for all, the Inhumans
transformed Adaline into a starship powered by

328
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:38,680
Blackbolt's voice and ventured into space. They
fluted the Kree homeworld of Hala where they

329
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:44,060
overthrew the empire that once created them. A war
with the Shiar followed, during which a pterogen

330
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:50,040
device called the T-bomb apparently killed
Blackbolt and the rule fell to Queen Medusa. The

331
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:55,500
Alpha Primitives revolted, Maximus again sought
the crown, and the Kree nobles resisted, eroding

332
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:01,520
Inhuman control. It was discovered that the Kree
had also altered other species long ago, not just

333
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:07,260
humans. These universal Inhumans, as it were,
traveled to Earth's moon and united with the

334
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:12,800
returned Blackbolt, stopping an attempt by the
Supreme Intelligence to attack Earth and retake

335
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:17,560
control of the Kree. Abandoning Hala and
returning back to their home planet, the Inhuman

336
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:23,640
royal family rebuilt Adaline, this time in the
clouds above New York City. Soon, the mad Titan

337
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:29,480
Thanos demanded that Adaline's render all
Inhumans within certain ages as tribute to him.

338
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:34,380
Blackbolt realized that hidden within the demand
was a hunt for Thanos' secret son, who was an

339
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:39,940
Inhuman descendant. The royal family evacuated
Adaline, and rather than submit to Thanos,

340
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:45,540
Blackbolt destroyed the city with a shout. This
triggered a pterogen bomb built by Maximus that

341
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:51,180
spread pterogen across the globe and awakened
powers in many people across Earth with dormant

342
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:57,180
Inhuman genes. In the aftermath, Blackbolt went
into exile for his actions, and Medusa rebuilt New

343
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:02,240
Adaline, an independent nation open to all
Inhumans. Crystal led a team aboard the royal

344
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,500
Inhumans' transport to track the drifting
pterogen cloud and protect people about to

345
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:12,360
change. Unfortunately, the cloud proved lethal
to mutants. Fearing extinction, mutant leaders

346
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,720
launched a preemptive strike against New
Adaline, neutralizing most of the royal family

347
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,620
and trapping them in a hostile dimension. After
learning the full stakes of what was happening,

348
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:26,860
Medusa destroyed the remaining pterogen cloud
herself. She abdicated the throne and passed

349
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:32,540
leadership to the Inhuman people, installing a
new Inhuman democracy. She and Blackbolt then

350
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:38,100
reunited and journeyed into space, seeking the
origins of pterogen. Their search led to the

351
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:44,100
discovery of Primogen, a mutagenic substance on
which the Kree had based their creation of

352
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:50,120
pterogen. Traveling back to Earth, the family
then founded a new Inhuman city called Arctilan on

353
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:54,680
the moon. There they were attacked by the Kree, who
learned about the Inhumans' acquisition of

354
00:33:54,680 --> 00:34:01,940
Primogen and gave them an ultimatum. Join the Kree
or die. The Kree massacred Inhumans across space.

355
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:06,480
Blackbolt summoned the leaders of the universal
Inhuman tribes to plan a response, but a Kree

356
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,460
executioner named Vox ambushed the gathering,
slaughtering the group. In the battle, Triton and

357
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:17,080
Maximus were seemingly killed, and Blackbolt's
throat was slit. After the remaining Inhuman

358
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:21,960
population was imprisoned, the royal family
escaped with help from Blackbolt's faint,

359
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,460
returning voice. They learned that Vox was not a
person, but a Kree program that converted

360
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:33,620
prisoners into living weapons. Given a directive
to acquire Primogen and weaponize the Inhumans,

361
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:38,620
Vox converted the Inhuman population and
embedded within them the code to restart the Vox

362
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:44,179
program should he be destroyed. With one paint
whisper, Blackbolt destroyed the engines that

363
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:50,600
transmitted the Vox program, ending the Kree's
plan, and ending the lives of most of the Inhumans.

364
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,400
The few survivors gathered, with Lockjaw
teleporting them home. The former royals learned

365
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:00,240
that they were just a few of the last remaining
Inhumans. And that's the Inhumans' history so

366
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,640
far. For this team duel, I'm obviously going with
the members of the Inhuman royal family, as

367
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,860
they're among some of the most prominent and
important members of the Inhuman race. This

368
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:14,800
includes Blackbolt, the former king of Adolan who
has the ability to absorb and convert electrons

369
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:21,280
into a devastating energy he can unleash through
his voice or channel into blasts, energy shields,

370
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,360
or used to enhance his own physiology. Queen
Medusa is next on my roster, who can scionically

371
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:32,100
control every strand of her tensile hair.
Crystal, her sister, is third on my team, able to

372
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:37,380
control the four elements of fire, earth, air, and
water. All three of them have their own duel

373
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:42,800
episodes we've done, but the rest are new. I'm
including Maximus, Blackbolt's brother, who is

374
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,580
mentally unstable, but also a powerful telepath
and genius strategist and inventor. Blackbolt's

375
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:53,400
cousins round out the rest of the team. There's
Karnak, the unparalleled fighter who can detect

376
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:59,280
the weak point of anything. Gorgon, the brute who
can create seismic shockwaves by stomping his

377
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,220
hooves. And finally Triton, the scaly
water-breathing scout with twin curved short

378
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:09,840
swords. And that's my team. I wanted to go with
Lockjaw, trust me, but we're going to be saving him

379
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,220
for a later team duel episode this year. If you're a
fan of Lockjaw, you probably already know what

380
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:19,600
that team is. Hey, spoiler warning! Just
listening to the Inhuman's backstory again, I'm

381
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:27,060
reminded of how good an Inhuman show should have
been. It should have been sci-fi Game of Thrones.

382
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:31,020
Yeah, we've said that multiple times on this
podcast, but it remains no less true. The

383
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:35,000
television show should have been so much better.
Now, if you've listened to our team duels before,

384
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:39,380
you know that we like to come up with comparable
rosters, finding some kind of analog between

385
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:44,940
characters of both sides. And this is just to make
sure that we're going into this matchup as

386
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:50,920
balanced as possible. Now, our matchups consist
of Spartan and Blackbolt, since they're both the

387
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:56,620
powerhouse leaders of each team, Warblade and
Medusa. Yes, since they could both shape shift

388
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:01,980
parts of their bodies into weapons. Void and
Crystal. One being able to control Space Time, the

389
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:07,920
other the elements. Boodoo versus Karnak, who
both have the ability of sight, essentially.

390
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:14,140
There's Maul and Gorgon, the brutes of each team.
Maximus and Grifter, the telepaths, and Zealot

391
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:19,200
and Triton, the weapon wielding warriors. Which I
thought lined up perfectly, considering we're

392
00:37:19,200 --> 00:38:19,140
both going with like the base rosters for each of
these teams, I would say. For sure. But now that

393
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:23,960
we've got the team's histories and rosters out of
the way, let's speculate on how one of the

394
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,920
thousands of simulated matches will go. The
winner is determined by simulations, not the

395
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,420
speculation, but it's fun to imagine how a fight
could play out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our

396
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:41,300
speculation? Well, I should say there are no rules
other than the teams have no prior knowledge of the

397
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:46,640
other going into the fight. All they are aware of
starting out is that the other side is a threat that

398
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:52,140
needs to be eliminated. For the speculation, the
groups will begin approximately 50 meters apart

399
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:57,120
in a non-descript environment that will have no
bearing on the match itself, as no environmental

400
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:02,840
statistics are considered in my simulations. The
teams must earn victory on their own merit. All

401
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:08,680
right, then let's get into it. The Wildcats and the
Inhumans meet on the battlefield. Who goes first?

402
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:15,480
I'm going to say Warblade starts things off for the
Wildcats by extending his long metal fingers into

403
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,480
the ground, at which point these long metal spears
are going to shoot up beneath the Inhumans

404
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:28,600
impaling them through their torsos. Damn, that's
how we do. Well, Gorgon sees Warblade's hands go

405
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:32,760
into the ground and already suspecting
something's up, he's going to quickly stomp the

406
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,820
ground with one of his hooves and that creates a
seismic shock that like breaks each of Warblade's

407
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:43,380
fingers in like 17 different locations. He's
like, oh, shit, my fingers. And this tremor that

408
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:49,460
Gorgon creates also knocks each of the Wildcats
members on their asses. OK, well, while on the

409
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:55,200
ground, Grifter, he's just going to mag dump his
dual pistols while telekinetically curving the

410
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,640
bullets so that each of the Inhumans gets two in the
chest and one in the head. John Wick style. Except

411
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:08,940
that black bolt throws up an energy shield that's
going to protect his family from all sunsets and it

412
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:14,800
also weakens a dust storm that affects the entire
area of the battlefield around the Wildcats. And

413
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,220
it's a heavy storm that blocks their vision. They
can't see anything. But then suddenly they all

414
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:24,160
start getting slapped around by a bunch of whips
created by Medusa's hair, who extends her hair

415
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,420
into the storm. And she could feel through it and
just beat the shit out of them simultaneously

416
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:36,140
while the Wildcats are inside. I mean, Void has a
spatial sense on a planetary scale. So maybe a few

417
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:42,460
Wildcats get hair whipped before Void teleports
her entire team out of the dust storm behind the

418
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:49,740
Inhumans, at which point Spartan is going to blast
them all in the back with this sweeping plasma beam

419
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:56,020
blasting across the Inhumans and frying them.
That's a good move. Okay, I forgot that you guys can

420
00:40:56,020 --> 00:41:01,480
teleport. Yeah, the Inhumans would probably be
taken by surprise by this. So they're all on the

421
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:07,620
ground and like singed on their backs with third
degree burns. Except for Maximus, because his

422
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:12,140
telepathy warned him of the attack because he
could detect the Wildcats' minds were behind

423
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:18,960
them. So they gave him enough time to react and duck
beneath the plasma beam. And while he's crouched

424
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:26,080
down, he pulls out a sonic rifle he has that he's
fueled with the same energy as Black Bolt's voice.

425
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:31,740
What? Like whispers of Black Bolt, right? And he
just lets Spartan have it. He fires the rifle and

426
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:37,200
punches a big basketball sized hole right through
Spartan's torso and he drops to the floor. He's an

427
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,440
android, right? Yeah, yeah, and actually that's
not going to take Spartan out. But while his

428
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:48,360
android body is on the ground repairing itself,
that's when Maul is going to Fastball Special

429
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:54,480
Zellet, hurling her right at Maximus, blades
first, and she straight up decapitates his ass.

430
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,760
No, no, no, no, no. She flies right into a force
field. He had set up this negative zone barrier

431
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,900
that was secretly activated in front of him. He set
up like negative zone barriers all the time in the

432
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:09,720
comic books, mostly around Adeline, but he has a
personal force field too, in this case. And she

433
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:15,780
crashes into it and slides down to the ground like a
bird who just crashed into a window. Dang. By this

434
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:21,320
point, the Inhumans have gotten up from the ground
after dealing with Spartan's attack and Crystal

435
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:28,680
is going to whip up and hurl a firestorm at the
Wildcats. It's just this big fiery tornado that's

436
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:34,840
shooting fireballs and it burns and just scatters
the Wildcats team. Okay, but Voodoo, she's going

437
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:41,760
to mindlock Crystal for an incident, causing her
mind to go blank and the fire tornado is going to

438
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:47,840
dissipate because of that. And with the fire gone,
Warblade is going to shift his hands and feet into

439
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:53,320
scissors, along with the ends of eight metallic
spider legs that he grows from his back. And he

440
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:58,960
leaps at Medusa, chopping up any hair that may get
in his way until he's able to get close enough to her

441
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,880
to deliver a fatal stabbing. Except I don't think
he can cut her hair because it's too durable. It has

442
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:09,420
like the tensile strength of iron wires. And his
blades could cut through anything. But like,

443
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:14,660
traditionally, Medusa's hair can't be cut unless
she wants it to be cut. But I also guess it stands to

444
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:21,720
reason that something sharp enough to cut it would
be able to do it. So say Warblade's cutting her hair

445
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:27,460
as she's defending herself, okay? Trying to fight
him off. What Warblade doesn't know is that Medusa

446
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:33,400
can still control any of her hair that's cut. What?
So as he's trying to get to Medusa, he gets all

447
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:39,780
tangled up in this mess of his own making. And so
he's now just busy slashing and fighting at these

448
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:46,120
hair strands, just flailing around. At that
point, Karnak flips in, he sees Warblade's weak

449
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:52,080
point, spots his opening, and then just karate
chops Warblade's spine with like the force of a

450
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:57,400
cannonball that just causes Warblade's liquid
metal form to explode into like liquid metal

451
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:03,680
droplets everywhere. Okay, well meanwhile,
thanks to Voodoo's gift of sight, she's able to see

452
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:10,120
how Black Bolt is restraining himself from making
vocalizations during the battle. So she uses her

453
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:15,500
psychic ability to separate Black Bolt from his
mental conditioning. And that's when Black Bolt

454
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:23,340
looks at Gorgon, just confused, and is like, what
just happened? Obliterating Gorgon. Geez. Well,

455
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:28,480
if he has forgotten his mental conditioning after
he sees Gorgon just get obliterated, he's gonna

456
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:34,080
turn his head and be like, holy shit! And that's
gonna obliterate Zellet, who happened to be in

457
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:40,880
front of him. What? So Zellet's out of the match as
well. And then Maximus, who's insane, but he's not

458
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,320
stupid, he knows he needs to silence his brother
for the sake of everybody, right? So he

459
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:51,380
telepathically reminds Black Bolt of his mental
conditioning to stay mute. Okay, but while

460
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:56,920
Maximus is distracted telepathically
communicating with his brother, Grifter, an

461
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:03,020
expert thief, is going to steal Maximus' sonic
rifle from him, and he's gonna use it to blow up

462
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:08,920
Maximus. Except that this gun, the sonic gun, is a
weapon designed for inhuman militia, so that

463
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:14,460
means it's programmed only to respond to the
genetic signature of an inhuman. So Grifter tries

464
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:19,640
to shoot Maximus, but instead the gun just
explodes in his hands. And now Grifter's arms are

465
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:24,680
gone. And before Grifter can even process what
just happened, Triton leaps by him and takes off

466
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:29,880
his head with one of his curved blades. What? Wait,
wait, wait. First of all, the pterodrine mist is

467
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:36,760
like a gas, right? Correct. Well, the gen factor
that Grifter inhaled was also a gas. What if it's

468
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:42,960
like the wildstorm pterodrine mist, making
Grifter an inhuman? No, I'm sorry. Not

469
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:50,240
genetically. Whatever. Grifter's gone, but he is
a demolition guy who's like armed to the teeth with

470
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:56,200
various explosive gadgets inside his trench
coat. So he may be dead, but the explosion from

471
00:45:56,200 --> 00:46:03,280
Maximus' gun sparks an igniter on one of his
grenades. And when that goes off, all of his

472
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,580
explosives go off, killing Triton as well. And,
you know, Maximus is probably pretty injured,

473
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:14,900
too, I'm sure. All right. Okay. So Triton is out.
Grifter's out. While this is all happening,

474
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:21,540
Karnak is fighting Maul. And Karnak is dodging
Maul's attacks just with like super efficiency,

475
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:27,660
striking all of his pressure points. So Maul's not
even really able to land a hit on Karnak. And Karnak

476
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:33,880
is going to strike a nerve in Maul's legs, which is
going to drop Maul to his knees. And then Karnak

477
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:39,100
leaps up and finger strikes him right in between
the eyes, which is a weak spot that makes his brain

478
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:44,360
explode inside his head. So now Maul's out. Except
that the last second, though, Maul's going to

479
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:50,380
shrink his body down to the size of a thimble in
order to dodge Karnak's attack. And at that size,

480
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:56,280
he's a super genius because, you know, his size
correlates with his intellect. And he's going to

481
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:03,720
deduce Karnak's one weakness, which is his
insides. So Maul's going to shrink down, jump into

482
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:10,000
Karnak's booty. No! Before expanding to
skyscraper size and just obliterating Karnak.

483
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,880
Did you just thinus Karnak? You're damn right I
did. What are you, nine? Why did he go in through the

484
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:23,240
butthole? Because he could. Anyway, Maul is now
the size of a skyscraper, you say. But that means

485
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:29,060
he's dumb as a rock. Okay? Fair. So suddenly he
starts beating the shit out of his own teammates.

486
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:34,900
He smashes Spartan, you know, before he can finish
repairing his android body. He just smacks Void

487
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:41,360
across the horizon and he pummel's voodoo into the
ground with his fists. All of this because now he's

488
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:46,940
being mind controlled by Maximus. Oh. Well, I
mean, Maul is said to be fairly psychic resistant

489
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:52,820
because of his decreased intellect at giant size.
No, well, I mean, the reason I did this is because

490
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:58,760
actually the more mindless that a subject is, the
more susceptible they are to Maximus's mind

491
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:04,740
control. Like that's why Maximus is so good at
controlling the alpha primitives. Really? Okay.

492
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:11,740
Wait, so Spartan's finished. But we'll say that as
Void is sailing across the horizon, she's going to

493
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:17,580
teleport back to the battle and rescue voodoo for
Maul's attack, like just in time. And with voodoo

494
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:22,420
using her gift of sight to be able to recognize
who's controlling Maul, that's when she

495
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:28,560
transforms into her daemonite demonic form and
just tears into Maximus, ripping him to shreds

496
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:33,800
while he's distracted. And meanwhile, you
remember how Warblade was sort of scattered

497
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:39,760
everywhere by Karnax attack? Yeah. Well, that
would not kill him because eventually all of those

498
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:45,460
metallic droplets would find their way back to
each other, sort of like T1000. And so we'll say by

499
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:52,800
this point, enough of Warblade's scattered
droplets have coalesced to form a long hammer,

500
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:59,760
which Maul by this point back to 10 feet tall or so
picks up and proceeds to pummel crystal into the

501
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:05,880
ground. Okay. So Warblade is back from being
exploded and he's just a hammer now. Right. Is he

502
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:13,940
like a hammer with Warblade's face? Uh, yes,
actually, specifically that. I wasn't sure if he

503
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:18,900
was just like an inanimate object now. No. But
Crystal's going to handle this liquid metal guy

504
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:25,080
the same way you would handle any liquid metal guy.
She's going to freeze the hammer so that shatters

505
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:31,140
when Maul swings it. So Warblade's gone for good
now. Maul's confused because his hammer broke on

506
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:39,820
him. And at that point, Crystal fills Maul's lungs
with water and he drowns. Oh, okay. Well, Crystal,

507
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:46,320
she's just going to get lasered and half at the
torso at this time by one of Void's quantum beams.

508
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:53,420
So she's out. And as that happened, Voodoo brought
Maul back as a zombie using her Voodoo knowledge

509
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:59,280
and she's going to control Maul to choke out Black
Bolt. And that's going to prevent him from using

510
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:06,160
his voice as he suffocates and dies. No, because
before Black Bolt suffocates, Medusa is going to

511
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:12,180
take a page from Maul's playbook and destroy him
from the inside. Okay, but she's not like a pervert

512
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:18,600
like he is. She goes in through his ears. So her hair
infiltrates Maul's skull through his ears and she

513
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:24,200
just scrambles his zombie brain to mush. All
right. And with Black Bolt free, he's just going to

514
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:31,740
take out both Void and Voodoo by shouting, like,
you guys suck. And they're just obliterated from

515
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:37,040
his voice and the Inhumans win. Wait, he
obliterates both of them? Do you think they were

516
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:43,820
standing like right next to each other? Because
they weren't. Says who? Me, bro. We'll say that

517
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:50,380
Voodoo freezes time just before the sound waves
reach her. And that's going to allow Void to set up a

518
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:57,820
portal that catches all of those sonic waves and
redirects them through another portal lined up to

519
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:04,220
hit both Medusa and Black Bolt. So they're dead
instead and the Wildcats win. Now you can't just

520
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:08,000
dictate where people are on the battlefield. I'm
saying that Void and Voodoo were standing next to

521
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,940
each other and they didn't have enough time to
react to Black Bolt's shout. Wait, I can't. But you

522
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:19,060
can? Yes. I mean, Singly didn't have enough time to
react also, by the way. Void literally controls

523
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:26,540
space time. So she'll just go back in time if they
didn't. Void's a bum. Okay. We could go out and

524
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:32,600
leave the match there. Either one of two things
happens. Either Black Bolt shouts Void and Voodoo

525
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:38,440
out of existence or they're able to redirect his
blast and Black Bolt ends up taking himself and

526
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:44,340
Medusa out. Let's go ahead and input the team
stats, run the simulations and find out which of

527
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:56,140
the scenarios happens when we come back with a
winner. 8G9K, hit it. Alright, that was a crazy

528
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:59,720
matchup. Both of these teams have some really
powerful members. There's actually a good

529
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:06,140
variety among both teams. They had a lot in common.
They had a lot that was not in common, but breaking

530
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:11,680
it all down. The teams were actually even when it
came to intelligence and versatility. Right. The

531
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:16,980
biggest discrepancy they had actually came down
to durability, considering basically all of the

532
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:22,580
Wildcat's characters have healing factors.
Yeah, they're all Wolverine wannabes. Like, the

533
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:28,620
inhumans have an accelerated rate of healing
compared to normal humans, but it's not crazy fast

534
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:33,240
like Wolverines and it's not fully regenerative
either. My most durable guys were Black Bolt,

535
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:38,100
Gorgon and Triton. People like Medusa, Crystal,
Karnak and Maximus just didn't have the same level

536
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:43,820
of durability. But the inhumans did have the
advantage when it came to the category of range.

537
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:49,850
Black Bolt, Crystal and Maximus and even Gorgon
have tremendous range with their attacks. You

538
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:54,480
know, Maximus being a psychic, Black Bolt with his
shouts, Crystal with her elemental powers and

539
00:52:54,480 --> 00:53:00,240
Gorgon with his seismic stomps. Yeah, when you're
going up against elemental powers with like

540
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:06,760
bullets and blades and stuff like that, it's not
quite as effective. My strongest character on my

541
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:14,660
side was Spartan, followed up by Void. And my
weakest character was actually Warblade. Yeah,

542
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:19,480
my strongest character obviously was Black Bolt
and the weakest member of the inhuman family is

543
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:24,480
actually Karnak, probably because he never
underwent terror genesis. And, you know, he's

544
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:29,460
really good at finding weak spots and striking to
defeat them. And he was smart, but he didn't have

545
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:34,900
those like superhuman stats that his cousins and
his brother have. Yeah, Karnak only won about a

546
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:41,160
quarter of his matches. He won 27.9 of the total
matches that he was in, which was not the lowest win

547
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:47,820
rate. Actually, Warblade had the lowest at 26%
even. Yeah, and Black Bolt had the highest win rate

548
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:52,640
individually, winning 81.3% of all of his
matches. And that was actually the highest win

549
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:59,580
rate overall, because my highest win rate was
79.9% held by Spartan. So taking all of these

550
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:04,780
figures and stats into account, Joseph, who do you
think came out on top in humans? They have the most

551
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:10,040
powerful member. Black Bolt had the highest win
rate. They're a pretty well rounded team. I'm

552
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:16,760
going to give it to the royal family. You would. And
Instagram agrees with me with 63% of our poll

553
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:22,180
respondents, citing with the inhumans saying
that they would defeat the Wildcats. Well, let's

554
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:29,680
see if you jerks are correct. AJ9K, the results,
please. Here you are, sir. The winner of the team

555
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:43,620
dual matchup between Wildcats and Inhumans is the
Wildcats, son of a bitch. No. The Wildcats won

556
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:53,220
52.5% of their matches compared to the Inhumans,
who only won 47.5. And honestly, I'm kind of as

557
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:57,580
surprised as you are. I thought the Inhumans were
going to take this. I mean, they have fucking Black

558
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:03,540
Bolt. You just start off the match by going, screw
you guys, and then it would be over. But yeah, Void

559
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:10,880
could, you know, just again, teleport all of the
energy back at them. The Inhumans had Black Bolt,

560
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:20,940
but the Wildcats had Spartan and Void and Grifter,
each of whom had over a 60% win rate. My guys overall

561
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:26,800
were just a little bit more powerful. Honestly, I
think it really came down to the defense of stats.

562
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:34,700
Having a healing factor really helps in battle, as
it turns out. I'm like horribly depressed now. I

563
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:40,920
was expecting to go into this with the Inhumans win
to give them some kind of victory and make up for all

564
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:46,140
the disappointments that fans have encountered
with them over the years. And here's just another

565
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:51,480
one to add to the fucking list. Honestly, I think
it's time to give up on the Inhumans. Like they have

566
00:55:51,480 --> 00:56:00,140
nothing going for them. I think it's time for you to
give up. You know what? You piece of shit. Jeez. But

567
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:07,320
that is it for this duel, guys. AJ9K helped close
this out. Thanks for listening to Dynamic Jewel.

581
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:21,500
to you guys next week. Up, up and away. True
believers. The amalgam version of these two teams

582
00:57:21,500 --> 
would be the cat humans, and it would be about the
lives of humans and their own cats.
