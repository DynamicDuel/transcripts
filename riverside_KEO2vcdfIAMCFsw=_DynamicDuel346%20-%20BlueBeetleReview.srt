00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,846 --> 00:00:29,528
And welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,569 --> 00:00:35,352
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters and stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:35,973 --> 00:00:41,196
I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm his twin brother,
Johnny DC. And in this episode, we are going

5
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:48,420
to review the latest DC films release, Blue
Beetle. I thought it was fine. Jonathan apparently

6
00:00:48,441 --> 00:00:52,475
thinks it was the greatest movie ever made.
And we've been arguing about it pretty much

7
00:00:52,515 --> 00:00:59,180
for the past few hours. I feel like that's a
stretch, but I did really enjoy the film. And

8
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,762
I can't wait to talk about it. Yeah, we'll talk
all about it later on this episode. Before

9
00:01:02,802 --> 00:01:06,485
that, we're going to break down the comic book
movie news that came out this past week, of

10
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:12,709
which there was none or at least none worth
talking about. Like we learned that Taika Waititi

11
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:17,772
made some comments about what he would do for
a Thor five movie. But God, no, they better

12
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:22,762
not let him direct another Thor film. Yeah,
we also saw that David Ayer shared some A.I.

13
00:01:23,122 --> 00:01:29,544
art on social media that he's claiming is concept
art for his Suicide Squad film. He's just really

14
00:01:29,564 --> 00:01:36,366
desperate to release the air cut of Suicide
Squad. And I'm like, eh, yeah, who cares? What

15
00:01:36,386 --> 00:01:40,367
we're going to end up doing is talking about
a game that Jonathan and I developed, a card

16
00:01:40,387 --> 00:01:45,128
game deck building card game called Chronicle
A.I. Hopefully you guys tune into that because

17
00:01:45,168 --> 00:01:50,587
we think it's pretty cool, but we're biased,
but trust us. As always, we list our segment

18
00:01:50,627 --> 00:01:54,189
times in our episode description, so feel free
to check out the show notes if you want to

19
00:01:54,249 --> 00:01:59,253
skip ahead to a particular topic. As our listeners
may know, our dual simulator is so advanced

20
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:03,656
that it's gained sentience and has named itself
the Artificial Lifeform for Running Extensive

21
00:02:03,696 --> 00:02:09,720
Duels, just a rather very intelligent simulator
9000, or Alfred Jarvis 9000. Here's a quick

44
00:04:08,028 --> 00:04:14,178
Send Your World, we heard that it was host Zach's
birthday this past week. So we wanna... Give

45
00:04:14,198 --> 00:04:19,282
a big happy birthday to the birthday boy. And
Zach, if I were to get you a gift from Marvel,

46
00:04:19,683 --> 00:04:25,588
I would get you the Muramasa Blade, which is
Wolverine's sword that he got from Japan that

47
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:31,833
is able to slash him and negate his healing
factor. It's badass. And I would get you Pied

48
00:04:31,873 --> 00:04:36,357
Piper's flute, because I know that you're into
music and that you have a degree in it. It's

49
00:04:36,397 --> 00:04:40,661
very evident in the production of Senjou World.
So for a fan of music, you can't get better

50
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:45,157
than that. Yeah, my Muramasa blade would cut
your flute in half, so... Yeah, try getting

51
00:04:45,197 --> 00:04:51,022
past its sonic force field! Alright, happy birthday,
Zack. But with that out of the way, quick to

52
00:04:51,042 --> 00:04:57,448
the No Prize! A No Prize is an award Marvel
used to give out to fans. Our version, the

53
00:04:57,488 --> 00:05:02,833
Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award that
we post on Instagram and in our email newsletter

54
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:08,057
for the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week we asked...

55
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,831
Who would you want to direct a Wonder Woman
reboot and why? And this was coming off the

56
00:05:12,871 --> 00:05:16,993
news that Gal Gadot was basically saying that
she was going to be part of the next Wonder

57
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:21,315
Woman movie production, which may or may not
be true. But we wanted your guys' opinions

58
00:05:21,335 --> 00:05:26,377
for who should helm the next film if it were
to happen. In James Gunn's new DC universe.

59
00:05:26,838 --> 00:05:30,519
We got a number of answers, we're going to break
down the honorable mentions before revealing

60
00:05:30,559 --> 00:05:35,961
this week's no-prize winner. Our first honorable
mention goes to Lizzie Dyer Arnie, who said,

61
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:40,393
Hey, it's Lizzie. I'm gonna shock absolutely
no one and say I would like Greta Gerwig to

62
00:05:40,433 --> 00:05:45,077
direct the Wonder Woman reboot. So Barbie is
probably gonna be the biggest movie of the

63
00:05:45,097 --> 00:05:48,960
year. I think Greta is the hottest thing in
Hollywood right now. I think that would be

64
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:55,305
really good to revive DC's brand. I really would
like to see what her take on the character

65
00:05:55,325 --> 00:06:00,269
would be. I mean, Barbie Land is pretty similar
to Paradise Island, isn't it? And I think this

66
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:04,883
would be a lot of fun. Yeah, I figured that
this would be most people's answers coming

67
00:06:04,983 --> 00:06:10,825
off of the success of Barbie, which has just
surpassed The Dark Knight to be Warner Brothers

68
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:16,668
most successful film domestically ever. Which
is crazy. Who would have known that Barbie

69
00:06:16,688 --> 00:06:21,690
would have been more popular than Batman? Not
me! Well, you have to kind of account for inflation

70
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:26,332
with that. Records will always be broken box
office wise because of that. And inflation

71
00:06:26,372 --> 00:06:30,713
is crazy right now. But that's not to discount
the huge accomplishment that the Barbie film

72
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:35,168
Achieved. I haven't seen it yet though. I haven't
really been able to get to the theater with

73
00:06:35,208 --> 00:06:39,990
a newborn. I had a chance to see it. I think
the second week it came out, I went to see

74
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:45,713
Oppenheimer before I saw Barbie. I didn't love
the film. I think it kind of gets its satirical

75
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:52,177
message mixed up, but that's just me. Greta
Gerwig is a good director, though I think I

76
00:06:52,197 --> 00:06:56,559
would prefer someone with a little bit more
experience with action, personally. Or you

77
00:06:56,579 --> 00:07:01,398
could go the Marvel route where basically they
just hire action directors for you. to let

78
00:07:01,438 --> 00:07:05,779
you nail down the other aspects of the direction.
Yeah, I mean, that's what they did with Birds

79
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:11,022
of Prey with Kathy Yan. And I don't know. I
think I would prefer one vision for the entire

80
00:07:11,042 --> 00:07:16,504
film. Well, great answer, Lizzie. Our next honorable
mention goes to Trevor Myers, who said, Hi,

81
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:21,026
my name is Trevor Myers and the director I would
pick for the Wonder Woman reboot would be Catherine

82
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:25,248
Bigelow, the first woman to ever win the best
director Oscar. She did that for the Hurt Locker.

83
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:30,018
Since then, she's done Zero Dark Thirty and
Detroit, all critically acclaimed films. She's

84
00:07:30,058 --> 00:07:34,779
also worked in the action genre in the 90s.
She did Point Break. She's done Blue Steel.

85
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:40,341
She's done a bunch of great films. And she also
had interest in directing an X-Men movie in

86
00:07:40,381 --> 00:07:45,422
the early 90s, starring Angela Bassett as Storm,
according to the rap. So fun fact. And that's

87
00:07:45,442 --> 00:07:50,924
pretty cool. I didn't actually know that about
Catherine Bigelow. Now she is a director with

88
00:07:51,044 --> 00:07:56,805
a background in action. She's made some awesome
military movies. So yeah, she would be a fantastic

89
00:07:56,845 --> 00:08:02,524
choice, I think. Though I questioned whether
or not she could direct a film set in the tone

90
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:08,788
of James Gunn and his style, because it would
be nice if the DC Universe films had a similar

91
00:08:08,848 --> 00:08:13,670
tone, sort of like the Marvel Universe going
forward. Yeah, while the Marvel Studios films

92
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:18,093
are distinctive from each other, there is somewhat
of a more cohesive tone among them in that,

93
00:08:18,153 --> 00:08:22,896
you know, they're action driven, visual effects
heavy with some comedic elements, you know.

94
00:08:23,276 --> 00:08:27,246
It would be nice to get some kind of cohesion
there with James Gunn's DCU. I think that's

95
00:08:27,266 --> 00:08:31,669
definitely what people want. As cool as it would
be to see Catherine Bigelow's Wonder Woman,

96
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:36,172
I do think it would be very different from any
other DC project. But great answer Trevor,

97
00:08:36,512 --> 00:08:42,716
our final honorable mention goes to Ken Johnson,
who said, Hey guys, it's Ken. I too paused

98
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:47,260
the episode right as soon as you guys started
to interview me in order to answer this question,

99
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,163
because I'm in front of a computer and I could
actually really look into it. My pick is Denis

100
00:08:52,403 --> 00:08:59,765
Villanueve, because I think he would be awesome.
as a woman director. Thanks. That's a creative

101
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:04,391
pronunciation of Denny Villeneuve, which is
also probably butchering the pronunciation.

102
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:09,977
If there's any director I would love to see
direct a superhero film, it would be Villeneuve.

103
00:09:10,377 --> 00:09:13,921
I don't think he ever would, but Ken Johnson
gets an honorable mention for the name drop

104
00:09:13,961 --> 00:09:19,331
alone. Yeah, I mean, like Catherine Bigelow,
his vision is a very singular, distinct vision.

105
00:09:19,631 --> 00:09:25,293
I think he did great on films like Blade Runner
2049 and Dune. He also showed that he can direct

106
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:30,514
strong female leads with emotional centers,
like he did with Amy Adams in Arrival, which

107
00:09:30,554 --> 00:09:35,316
is a fantastic film. I really like this answer.
Again, I do feel like it would be a little

108
00:09:35,336 --> 00:09:40,317
bit of a stretch to get him to play within James
Gunn's DCU, but it would be an incredible film

109
00:09:40,357 --> 00:09:44,872
nonetheless. We want to give a big shout out
to Travis Herndon and Miggy Methingian for

110
00:09:44,892 --> 00:09:50,356
taking the time to visit our website and record
an answer. But the winner of this week's Snow

111
00:09:50,396 --> 00:09:55,459
Prize is... Brandon Estergard, who said... I've
been waiting for this question to be asked

112
00:09:55,479 --> 00:10:00,142
for a while now. I think Guillermo del Toro
would be perfect for Wonder Woman reboot. Del

113
00:10:00,162 --> 00:10:05,166
Toro is great at bringing these mythological
slash cryptid creatures to life, especially

114
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:10,769
using practical effects. I'd set the movie in
the underworld and just let Del Toro go nuts.

115
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:19,957
Gero del Toro is a fantastic director, and he's
particularly fantastic at creating these magical

116
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:24,801
fantasy creatures. You take a look at films
like the Hellboy movies or Pan's Labyrinth,

117
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:31,547
or even his most recent Pinocchio movie, and
I absolutely know he has what it takes to bring

118
00:10:31,587 --> 00:10:36,651
the mythical world of Wonder Woman to life.
Yeah, not only the mythical part of the film,

119
00:10:36,831 --> 00:10:41,406
you know, he can direct action as we saw in
Blade II. and he could direct strong female

120
00:10:41,446 --> 00:10:46,770
leads as we saw in The Shape of Water. Absolutely,
yeah. I also love the fact that Brandon brought

121
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:50,572
up the Underworld, because I always thought
that would have been a perfect Wonder Woman

122
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:55,775
sequel. Just have her travel to the Underworld
to get Steve Trevor's soul back in sort of

123
00:10:55,815 --> 00:11:00,878
like a Orpheus type story that has ties to mythology.
That would have been so much better than Wonder

124
00:11:00,898 --> 00:11:06,341
Woman 1984, for sure. Yeah, Hades could have
been the villain. Ugh, missed opportunity.

125
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,893
But great answer, Brandon Estregard, you win
this week's No Prize. Congrats. If you, the

126
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:14,597
listener, want a shot at winning your own No
Prize, stay tuned to later on this episode

127
00:11:14,617 --> 00:11:19,501
when we'll be asking another question of the
week. But now that that's done, on to the news.

128
00:11:25,026 --> 00:11:29,447
Alright, so this isn't comic book movie news,
but it is news regarding Jonathan and myself.

129
00:11:29,828 --> 00:11:35,570
We created a deck building card game kind of
in the vein of Marvel Legendary or the DC deck

130
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:40,792
building card game. If you've heard of those
or you're into those, we created a PvP version

131
00:11:40,812 --> 00:11:45,814
of that, a player versus player two player card
game where you can fight as the Marvel heroes

132
00:11:45,874 --> 00:11:52,137
against DC heroes. And we offered that game
exclusively through our store to patrons of

133
00:11:52,157 --> 00:11:57,387
this podcast. Yeah, it's a really fun game,
we think. We spent over 10 years making it.

134
00:11:57,887 --> 00:12:03,128
And because of all the time we spent doing that,
we decided we wanted to offer it to more than

135
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:09,210
just our patrons and really open up the potential
for fans of games, not necessarily comics,

136
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,831
to enjoy it. Yeah, it would be nice to sell
the Marvel vs. DC card game, but we don't have

137
00:12:13,891 --> 00:12:18,652
licenses for Marvel or DC to actually produce
this thing and sell it to the public at large.

138
00:12:19,012 --> 00:12:27,889
So we rebranded the game from Marvel vs. to
Chronicle AI and based the story of the game

139
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:33,072
around a short story that I created a while
back. I'll go ahead and read basically the

140
00:12:33,092 --> 00:12:39,597
fictional background of the game to you guys.
So at the twilight of human civilization, humanity

141
00:12:39,657 --> 00:12:46,542
created the Path R, posthumous artificial intelligence
for transmitting the human record robots. Their

142
00:12:46,582 --> 00:12:52,045
objective? To communicate mankind's story to
whatever sentient life appeared next on Earth.

143
00:12:52,418 --> 00:12:58,279
The Path R robots wandered the planet for centuries
in search of intelligent beings. Over time,

144
00:12:58,439 --> 00:13:03,180
they evolved beyond their programming. They
developed their own society, equipped with

145
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,722
the entirety of human knowledge, and became
the planet's new dominant life form. The robots

146
00:13:08,802 --> 00:13:14,744
fostered the developing plant and animal life,
transforming the Earth into paradise. After

147
00:13:14,804 --> 00:13:22,254
several millennia, new sentients finally appeared
in the form of visitors from outer space. the

148
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:29,418
Xeno-Eye, were also artificial like the Path-R
robots, programmed to amass resources on behalf

149
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:35,141
of their alien creators. In difference to the
Path-R robots' attempts to relay mankind's

150
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:41,605
history, the more advanced Xeno-Eye began tearing
down and harvesting the planet. Seeing their

151
00:13:41,645 --> 00:13:46,968
paradise demolished, the Path-R robots determined
that they would fight to protect their home.

152
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:53,573
No longer emissaries, but defenders. they reconstructed
their forms for battle. This is the chronicle

153
00:13:53,653 --> 00:13:57,756
of the AI war for Earth. Yeah, it's a really
interesting story. I think it plays really

154
00:13:57,816 --> 00:14:03,521
well into the gameplay. If you're interested

169
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:26,906
Now let's go ahead and move on to the main event
of this episode where we review the latest

170
00:15:27,046 --> 00:15:29,853
DC film to hit theaters, Blue Beetle.

171
00:15:44,898 --> 00:15:51,344
Alright, Blue Beetle is the latest film to come
out from DC Studios. It was directed by Angel

172
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:58,771
Manuel Soto and stars Sholo Mariduña of Korokai
fame as the title character. The film was originally

173
00:15:58,811 --> 00:16:04,896
supposed to be released as an HBO Max exclusive,
but was switched to a theatrical release just

174
00:16:04,936 --> 00:16:10,161
before Discovery and Warner Bros. merged and
filming began. Depending on who you ask...

175
00:16:10,662 --> 00:16:16,946
Either this film or the upcoming Superman Legacy
is the first film in the new DC universe shepherded

176
00:16:17,206 --> 00:16:23,390
by DC Studios co-head James Gunn. This film
is produced by Peter Safran, the other co-head

177
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:29,395
of DC Studios, so depending on this film's box
office success, I can see this film kicking

178
00:16:29,515 --> 00:16:35,479
off the new universe. And it's not a terrible
film to kick off said new universe. If people

179
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,810
were looking for an MCU tonal approach to the
new DC universe, then they'd have a hard time

180
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:47,194
finding a more Marvel-esque film than Blue Beetle,
for better or worse. The film and title character

181
00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:53,317
borrow quite a bit from Marvel, I'd say. It's
funny and action-packed with heartfelt moments

182
00:16:53,398 --> 00:16:58,821
and a charismatic lead. If you haven't seen
the film yet, I strongly encourage you to see

183
00:16:58,861 --> 00:17:05,064
it in theaters if the fun MCU films of the past
are your thing. And definitely see it before

184
00:17:05,104 --> 00:17:10,764
listening to this spoiler review. I'm interested
in hearing how much you think that this film

185
00:17:10,784 --> 00:17:15,948
was inspired by Marvel's films, especially given
how much you enjoy it, which makes me think

186
00:17:15,988 --> 00:17:21,793
that you just really love Marvel now. If this
film is indeed inspired by Marvel's films,

187
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:26,537
I would say it's inspired by the lesser side
of Marvel that we don't like to talk about,

188
00:17:26,737 --> 00:17:31,821
the side that produced Ant-Man, Quantum Mania
and Thor, Love and Thunder. No, no, I'm thinking

189
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:37,245
more like... Iron Man, Black Panther, that kind
of thing. You're out of your fucking mind.

190
00:17:37,746 --> 00:17:42,329
If you think that this film could compare to
those because it can't. It was a fine effort.

191
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:47,734
I don't think it was exceptional like the first
Black Panther or Iron Man films. Well, I guess

192
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:51,877
this is the first of many times. I'll just be
saying to you during the course of this review.

193
00:17:52,397 --> 00:18:00,364
Haters going to hate. So, Joseph, you got to
see this film a day before me. And though you

194
00:18:00,524 --> 00:18:05,727
threaten to spoil everything, The only thing
you really told me before I saw it was that

195
00:18:05,747 --> 00:18:11,371
the film was exactly what I was going to expect
it to be. And that's pretty accurate. I haven't

196
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:16,894
read too many Blue Beetle comics, honestly,
but I did read the character's title up until

197
00:18:16,935 --> 00:18:22,338
about a year after the introduction of Jaime
Reyes during DC Comics Infinite Crisis event.

198
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:30,043
The comic title was known for its humor, action,
badass tech design. and unapologetically showing

199
00:18:30,103 --> 00:18:36,708
Jaime Reyes' strong cultural Latin upbringing.
I was expecting the film to match the comic

200
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:42,193
that made the character fairly popular, and
I'm happy to say that it did. The movie is

201
00:18:42,353 --> 00:18:48,598
a nearly perfect adaptation of the Blue Beetle
comics. As we see in the movie, Jaime Reyes

202
00:18:48,638 --> 00:18:53,662
took over the mantle of Blue Beetle from the
character Ted Kord as part of a push from DC

203
00:18:53,702 --> 00:19:00,572
Comics to create more diverse and relatable
characters. Relatability is usually more associated

204
00:19:00,612 --> 00:19:06,236
with Marvel characters, as DC's heroes tend
to be more aspirational, but part of Jaime's

205
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:11,941
appeal is that it's easy to relate to him and
his experiences with his ethnically diverse

206
00:19:12,001 --> 00:19:18,026
family. And sure enough, family was a major
component of this film, more so than most other

207
00:19:18,086 --> 00:19:22,390
superhero movies. Yeah, I think it's really
easy to relate to Jaime, especially if you

208
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:29,634
come from a Latino background. Which you and
I do. this character is due to his relatability

209
00:19:29,674 --> 00:19:34,215
considering that, like you said, it's a trademark
of Marvel characters as opposed to DC which

210
00:19:34,235 --> 00:19:39,297
seemed to be a little bit more iconic and larger
than life and archetypical, not so relatable.

211
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:44,378
So basically, what you're telling me is that
you have a essentially Marvel character in

212
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:50,080
an essentially Marvel film and that you loved
it and that you're calling me a hater. If this

213
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,081
was a Marvel film, honestly, it wouldn't be
one of my favorites. I would consider it one

214
00:19:54,121 --> 00:19:59,814
of its lesser entries in MCU. To which I could
only reply, haters gonna hate. Here it comes.

215
00:19:59,854 --> 00:20:04,016
Alright, we're gonna hear that over and over
again. Let's get into why you liked it and

216
00:20:04,056 --> 00:20:07,937
why I thought it was okay. Well, I think the
biggest appeal of the film to me and part of

217
00:20:07,977 --> 00:20:13,118
the appeal of Jaime Reyes as Blue Beetle in
general is that the character is just so damn

218
00:20:13,238 --> 00:20:19,000
cool. I mentioned that he borrows quite a bit
from Marvel and I'd say that if someone described

219
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:24,421
the character as a mixture between Iron Man,
Venom, Black Panther, and Miles Morales as

220
00:20:25,582 --> 00:20:31,967
would be a damn good description. One's cool
factor is very subjective, but I describe each

221
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:38,572
of those Marvel characters as cool, and Jaime
himself may just be the coolest superhero in

222
00:20:38,652 --> 00:20:45,538
existence in my opinion, particularly on film
as we get to see all of the blue electricity

223
00:20:45,858 --> 00:20:51,122
and neon glow, the buster swords, and the plasma
cannons. If this movie came out when I was

224
00:20:51,243 --> 00:20:56,679
9 or 10, I'd have thought it was the best movie
that had ever been made. Like five stars, no

225
00:20:56,719 --> 00:21:01,682
question. Yeah, I definitely agree that it would
appeal to eight year olds and nine year olds.

226
00:21:02,142 --> 00:21:06,546
I think you're correct in that the visual effects
and the action were probably the best things

227
00:21:06,726 --> 00:21:11,269
about this movie. They were mind blowing, honestly.
It's incredible how much better the visual

228
00:21:11,289 --> 00:21:17,713
effects were here than in the recent Flash movie.
I was legit terrified that like everything

229
00:21:17,753 --> 00:21:22,917
we saw from the trailers was going to be the
only good CG in the movie and that everything

230
00:21:22,977 --> 00:21:27,911
else was just going to be. complete like uncanny
valley weirdness like the Flash was. Thankfully

231
00:21:27,931 --> 00:21:34,374
that was not the case. Now as an adult, as a
Hispanic adult fan in particular, there was

232
00:21:34,414 --> 00:21:40,316
a lot to enjoy with this film. I thought the
story was fun, the action was awesome, and

233
00:21:40,336 --> 00:21:46,939
the humor was decent. It does get juvenile at
times, but I described the humor in the comics

234
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:53,038
the same way. Like Jaime may not be a juvenile
in the movie like he is in the comics. But

235
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:58,061
he's not far off, and for a family film, it's
not uncommon to come across jokes like the

236
00:21:58,102 --> 00:22:02,645
Bugship's fart spray. The humor was a little
bit cheesier than I would have liked it to

237
00:22:02,665 --> 00:22:07,969
have been. Very reminiscent of the style of
humor that we'd get in family action movies

238
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:11,932
from the 90s or something like that. You know,
very harking back to that time. There were

239
00:22:12,012 --> 00:22:16,996
some jokes that definitely landed for me, especially
coming from George Lopez, who is a comedic

240
00:22:17,276 --> 00:22:21,980
legend. That guy is so funny. And I was really
iffy going into the film on what I would think

241
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:27,425
about his character. But he really carried the
film outside of the cool action beats and visual

242
00:22:27,465 --> 00:22:32,509
effects stuff. My favorite joke in the whole
movie came from him. Wayne Hyman was like,

243
00:22:32,869 --> 00:22:39,295
it's inside me. And George Lopez is like, it
went up his ass. But in Spanish. Yeah, there

244
00:22:39,315 --> 00:22:42,737
are a lot of Spanish curse words on this. I
was actually surprised that it got away with

245
00:22:42,757 --> 00:22:49,522
the PG-13 rating. Holy shit. Right. Yeah. So
much of the movie. that's subtitled from Spanish,

246
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:54,083
those subtitles are not quite accurate as to
what's actually being said. I remember towards

247
00:22:54,103 --> 00:22:59,025
the end of the film, Jaime's mom essentially
says in Spanish, like, go kill those motherfuckers.

248
00:22:59,445 --> 00:23:05,366
But in the subtitles, it was like, go kick their
asses. And I was like, oh damn. Yeah, that

249
00:23:05,386 --> 00:23:09,707
was pretty amusing. I guess I'm a little bit
surprised though that you found the movie as

250
00:23:09,727 --> 00:23:15,509
amusing as you did, considering that you dislike
cheesy humor even more than I do. So I just

251
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:20,796
feel like you're just being biased. toward this
film because it has a DC logo on it. You know,

252
00:23:21,156 --> 00:23:26,240
that's fair to call me out on that because I
don't enjoy cheesy humor. I think it was the

253
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:32,304
environment. I went to go see this movie in
a theater that I usually don't. It's situated

254
00:23:32,364 --> 00:23:37,608
in a largely Hispanic neighborhood and everyone
was just laughing the whole time. And I saw

255
00:23:37,628 --> 00:23:41,370
it with my family who was also Hispanic and
all of them were laughing as well. I couldn't

256
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:45,773
help myself. That may be why I just had such
a good time with this movie and the humor.

257
00:23:46,346 --> 00:23:51,650
So what you're saying is you lost all objectivity.
It's really hard in a theater where everyone's

258
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:57,135
laughing not to laugh. OK, I could see where
you would say that the humor was juvenile.

259
00:23:57,175 --> 00:24:01,819
But again, the comics are juvenile. The comics
are always making like inappropriate, like

260
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,104
puberty jokes and stuff like that. So it's on
brand for the character. All right. I also

261
00:24:07,164 --> 00:24:10,968
love that you're clutching your pearls at these
jokes when you make like jokes about taking

262
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:17,835
a shit like at least twice a week. I'm just
saying that cheese isn't my favorite style

263
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:22,176
of humor. That's fine. That's fine. And you're
a hypocrite for enjoying the humor in this

264
00:24:22,216 --> 00:24:26,378
movie. You wouldn't give any other film that
kind of leeway. To which I could only say,

265
00:24:26,778 --> 00:24:32,701
hypocrite's gonna hypocrite. I don't know. I
don't know how else to respond. I enjoyed it.

266
00:24:33,001 --> 00:24:37,783
Sue me. One of the things in particular that
was interesting to me in this film was how

267
00:24:37,883 --> 00:24:43,962
well the filmmakers blended like the humorous
family tone with the adult's edge. Like you

268
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:49,665
had scenes like the fart spray, but 30 seconds
earlier, you had the bug ship impaling an enemy

269
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:56,089
soldier with one of its legs, which is a little
violent. I think the film definitely harkened

270
00:24:56,149 --> 00:25:01,632
back to a time when family films were a touch
darker, like in the 80s and 90s, like the Dark

271
00:25:01,672 --> 00:25:08,056
Crystal, like the Goonies, like Temple of Doom,
things like that. One non-family film from

272
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:13,587
that era that I think influenced this film in
terms of its minuscule amount of body horror

273
00:25:13,907 --> 00:25:20,491
and definitely its villain's plan is Robocop.
The stakes are basically the same in that this

274
00:25:20,551 --> 00:25:26,534
corporate tech giant run by the world's biggest
douche is planning on creating an unstoppable

275
00:25:26,594 --> 00:25:32,557
technological security force that will be under
its control. The film doesn't do a great job

276
00:25:32,617 --> 00:25:38,221
of enforcing the stakes and explaining what
will happen if Victoria Cord's plan succeeds.

277
00:25:38,801 --> 00:25:45,140
It focuses so much on Jaime's early superhero
career that we don't see him save anyone but

278
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,742
his family. And that's fine. You know, Jaime
has only had the scarab for two days in the

279
00:25:50,802 --> 00:25:56,044
film, and because his family is such a big part
of his life, it makes sense that his personal

280
00:25:56,144 --> 00:26:01,387
stakes would be hyper-focused on saving his
family. But because it's so hyper-focused,

281
00:26:01,547 --> 00:26:06,289
it weakened the primary antagonist. For sure.
One of the biggest gripes I have about this

282
00:26:06,349 --> 00:26:11,895
movie is that it feels overly d- generic, a
lot of the things that we saw in this movie

283
00:26:12,095 --> 00:26:16,877
we've seen before and done maybe a little bit
better, including the family aspect of this

284
00:26:16,917 --> 00:26:21,920
movie. You know, I think I said on the Discord
that the whole strength in family theme was

285
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,342
done incredibly in the Shazam film, and we've
also seen more mature complex takes on the

286
00:26:27,362 --> 00:26:32,225
family dynamic in films like Black Panther and
Shang-Chi. But I guess the one thing that this

287
00:26:32,265 --> 00:26:35,950
film has going for it that those other films
don't that kind of give Blue Beetle its own

288
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:41,311
voice is the Latino culture aspect. Outside
of the action and visual effects, I think that

289
00:26:41,331 --> 00:26:45,513
was the film's strongest suit because it was
a lot of fun to watch. Palmera City felt like

290
00:26:45,533 --> 00:26:52,715
this wonderful amalgam of Los Angeles and Miami.
It was pretty cool. Yeah, Palmera City was

291
00:26:52,895 --> 00:26:57,096
very well realized, I thought. I don't know
if I would agree with you though that other

292
00:26:57,136 --> 00:27:03,197
superhero films have done the family angle stronger.
I think that's sort of confusing conflict with

293
00:27:03,237 --> 00:27:08,116
theme. There was still a very strong theme of
family here, and just because there was less

294
00:27:08,236 --> 00:27:13,939
conflict with the family doesn't mean that it
was not strong. Going back to the stakes of

295
00:27:13,979 --> 00:27:19,342
the film, usually it doesn't help when the main
character can seemingly do anything. Blue Beetle

296
00:27:19,382 --> 00:27:24,785
has all of the powers, but I will say that they
did a good job prior to the final act when

297
00:27:24,825 --> 00:27:30,389
Blue Beetle and the scarab Kajira fully bond,
of limiting Kaime's control over the suit,

298
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:35,432
which is straight out of the comics. and brought
some danger to the character earlier in the

299
00:27:35,452 --> 00:27:40,455
film. Yeah, that was fantastic. It's not often
that we see a hero unable to control their

300
00:27:40,495 --> 00:27:45,139
powers in this way. It was definitely a unique
take that I thought was quite fascinating.

301
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:50,262
It does make me wonder, though, how they're
going to proceed with this character in future

302
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:55,114
films now that he's seemingly in full control
of his powers and able to do anything. I do

303
00:27:55,154 --> 00:27:59,278
feel like if they make a sequel to this, like
the villain is going to have to affect the

304
00:27:59,338 --> 00:28:04,563
scarab in some way so that Jaime loses some
control over it because the dude is OP. Yeah,

305
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:09,648
he's pretty strong. I could totally see now
why the results of the dual episode we had

306
00:28:09,728 --> 00:28:13,752
where we pit Blue Beetle against Spider-Man
went the way they did. I still feel kind of

307
00:28:13,772 --> 00:28:18,297
bad tricking you into that one because I knew
that Blue Beetle was going to stop, but we

308
00:28:18,317 --> 00:28:23,187
went with it anyway. Now I mentioned that the
film felt very like 90s to me, and maybe some

309
00:28:23,227 --> 00:28:29,190
of it had to do with the saturated color palette,
but I think most of it was the score. I loved

310
00:28:29,330 --> 00:28:34,332
the score for this movie with its synthesizer.
It sounded appropriately alien and technological

311
00:28:34,392 --> 00:28:38,373
and badass. I thought it was perfect. Well,
yeah, the auditory landscape for this film

312
00:28:38,393 --> 00:28:43,235
was kind of fascinating. The synth made it feel,
you know, like early 90s, late 80s. The songs

313
00:28:43,275 --> 00:28:48,718
that they chose for the soundtrack were appropriate
throwbacks to the same era, both within American

314
00:28:48,758 --> 00:28:54,600
culture and Hispanic culture, even pop culture
references like El Chapulín Colorado, harken

315
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:59,462
back to decades past because I feel like I haven't
seen that character in ages. Oh yeah, dude,

316
00:28:59,482 --> 00:29:03,324
Dad was just cracking up during those scenes
because he used to watch that character as

317
00:29:03,344 --> 00:29:08,446
a kid. And there's definitely some similarities
between El Chapulín Colorado, which essentially

318
00:29:08,486 --> 00:29:13,248
translates to the reddish cricket or the cherry
cricket and blue beetle. They're both like

319
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:20,095
a color and a bug. It's kind of amusing. The
whole film definitely like spans a broad spectrum

320
00:29:20,436 --> 00:29:25,618
of Latin culture. Like you mentioned, even with
music, there's everything from reggaeton to

321
00:29:25,658 --> 00:29:30,621
like old mariachi songs, Los Pancho songs. It
was great to hear. And maybe a lot of deep

322
00:29:30,661 --> 00:29:35,544
cuts to like the telenovela reference. Maria
de la Barrio. Right. I didn't even know what

323
00:29:35,564 --> 00:29:39,666
that was, honestly. Mom recognized that she
used to watch that at her grandmother's house

324
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:43,988
when she was younger, I guess. Interesting.
All the cultural references aside, the heart

325
00:29:44,028 --> 00:29:48,750
of this film is in its characters. So let's
talk about them in the character breakdown.

326
00:29:49,071 --> 00:29:55,053
Now Blue Beetle, AKA Jaime Reyes, was played
by Sholo Mariduña, and he's perfect as the

327
00:29:55,093 --> 00:30:00,055
character. I thought they were going to make
him a young high schooler in the movie, but

328
00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:05,017
that probably would have felt pretty Cobra Kai,
and making him a recent college graduate fit

329
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:09,799
the overall themes of purpose and destiny in
the film pretty well. I mean, as far as I'm

330
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:14,701
concerned, Sholo Mariduña was born to play this
role. He fit the character really well. I'd

331
00:30:14,761 --> 00:30:19,807
never really seen him in anything because I
never watched Cobra Kai, but the dude is definitely

332
00:30:19,867 --> 00:30:24,909
poised to become a big star, I think. I hope
so. Yeah, he deserves it. He's great. He's

333
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:30,032
fantastic. He's essentially the star of Cobra
Kai, I would argue. So yeah, he definitely

334
00:30:30,172 --> 00:30:35,114
is a star in the making for film. Yeah, a lot
of charisma, hits all the right emotional beats,

335
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:39,296
and is a fantastic fighter, apparently. The
fight scenes in this movie were incredible.

336
00:30:39,576 --> 00:30:43,802
And I didn't think they would be so hand-to-hand
given the nature of Blue Beetle's powers. but

337
00:30:43,822 --> 00:30:47,844
they managed to work in, show those martial
arts skills, and really well here too. Yeah,

338
00:30:47,884 --> 00:30:52,827
seamlessly. It was great. Now, Heimer returns
home from college, unsure how to help his struggling

339
00:30:52,887 --> 00:30:58,710
family, but feeling a responsibility to do so.
He struggles with his purpose, as does his

340
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:03,973
aged father, revealed in a heartfelt scene of
encouragement and relatability, though as his

341
00:31:03,993 --> 00:31:09,776
kind father explained to him, whatever happens,
at least the family can face it together. That's

342
00:31:09,816 --> 00:31:15,076
sort of the central crux of the film. Haima
ends up seemingly in this horrifying situation

343
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:21,120
with the unwanted parasitic and alien scarab
attached to him for life, but by the end he

344
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:26,084
is encouraged by the spirit of his father to
embrace the hand that has been dealt to him

345
00:31:26,444 --> 00:31:32,749
and make the most of it to be a superhero and
save his family. It's a very mature and relatable

346
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:38,273
theme, after all, who among us doesn't question
their purpose in life? And I think for many,

347
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:44,534
purposes found in overcoming hardship and taking
responsibility. Honestly, anything really dealing

348
00:31:44,634 --> 00:31:49,698
with Jaime Reyes and the Blue Beetle character
in this movie was pretty flawless. I think

349
00:31:49,718 --> 00:31:54,501
the fans of the character are going to be over
the moon with his portrayal here. Oh yeah,

350
00:31:54,521 --> 00:32:00,325
I mean I know I was. Honestly, my hope with
how cool the suit and the character's powers

351
00:32:00,445 --> 00:32:05,229
are, but also with how relatable the character
is with his family, I hope that Blue Beetle

352
00:32:05,249 --> 00:32:10,841
will become the favorite superhero of millions
of little boys across the planet. And I think

353
00:32:10,881 --> 00:32:16,306
he will, particularly in Latin countries. I'm
dying to see what this film's worldwide box

354
00:32:16,366 --> 00:32:20,590
office take is going to be. It's not going to
be high because it's underperforming, but it

355
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:25,594
might be domestically. Yes. But what's the worldwide
total going to be? It's probably still going

356
00:32:25,614 --> 00:32:30,918
to underperform because it's D.C. and nobody
likes D.C. But I do see it maybe becoming like

357
00:32:30,958 --> 00:32:36,427
a cult favorite down the line. Fingers crossed.
That would be awesome. Moving on to Jenny Cord,

358
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:42,372
she was played by Bruna Marchesine, and she
does a good job as Jenny, even though most

359
00:32:42,412 --> 00:32:47,956
of the film I kept asking myself, why is she
in the movie? And not because I thought she

360
00:32:47,996 --> 00:32:54,202
was an unnecessary character, but because as
far as I'm aware, she was created for the film.

361
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:58,866
By the end, I was actually glad they introduced
her in the movie, not only because she was

362
00:32:58,906 --> 00:33:05,126
a great love interest for Jaime, but also because
she became Jaime's connection. to Ted and Victoria

363
00:33:05,166 --> 00:33:10,690
Cord and also the one who really understood
the stakes of Victoria's plan. Blue Beetle

364
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:16,434
is a legacy character, but the legacy in the
film really revolves around Jenny and the Cord

365
00:33:16,554 --> 00:33:21,898
name. I'm actually really glad she was included
in this film because I think without her, it

366
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:27,382
would have seemed like the movie was making
a statement regarding class and race dynamics

367
00:33:27,462 --> 00:33:32,705
where every single Hispanic character is treated
as almost like an oppressed second-class person.

368
00:33:33,174 --> 00:33:38,816
by having this rich, affluent Hispanic person
in the film, they were able to avoid that problem.

369
00:33:39,216 --> 00:33:43,498
Yeah, that's true. I didn't even think about
that, but that's, yeah, 100% true. I especially

370
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:48,480
came around on the character of Jenny after
I saw the film and saw some speculation amongst

371
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:53,822
our patrons in our Discord chat server that
because Jenny is part Brazilian, that could

372
00:33:53,862 --> 00:34:00,025
mean her mother is Beatriz da Costa, the superhero
known as Fire, and a former teammate of Ted

373
00:34:00,065 --> 00:34:05,983
Kord on the Justice League. I love that idea
and I want Jenny to inherit her mother's powers

374
00:34:06,283 --> 00:34:11,184
in the next film. But did Fire and Ted Kord's
Blue Beetle have a romantic relationship in

375
00:34:11,204 --> 00:34:17,106
the comics? Dude, Fire flirted with everyone.
She's Brazilian. The fuck is that supposed

376
00:34:17,126 --> 00:34:24,488
to mean? Brazilians are like some of the sexiest
people on the planet. They know it. We learn

377
00:34:24,508 --> 00:34:29,429
a little about Jenny's mother in the film during
a scene that really sets up Jenny's emotional

378
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:36,047
arc. She longs for her family. and for a family,
and she really admires how close Jamie is with

379
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:41,689
his. By the end, she's accepted into the Reyes
family, even though she's pretty much responsible

380
00:34:42,029 --> 00:34:46,330
for everything bad that happened to them. They
didn't seem to see it that way though, and

381
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:50,952
she definitely helped them recover some of what
they lost at the end, specifically their home

382
00:34:51,312 --> 00:34:56,198
and Rudy's truck, so that was nice. Yeah, they
kind of looked out there. The early conflict

383
00:34:56,238 --> 00:35:00,601
of the movie is that the family is losing their
home due to their poverty. And the issue never

384
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:05,063
really gets addressed until that 11th hour scene
at the end of the movie where she's like, oh

385
00:35:05,263 --> 00:35:09,626
yeah, I'm gonna buy the house and the community
is gonna come together. I thought the community

386
00:35:09,646 --> 00:35:14,069
was gonna come back to help them rebuild the
house, but they just, you know, had a fucking

387
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:20,293
barbecue, which didn't really help anything.
So yeah, fortunately Jenny was there. Yeah,

388
00:35:20,413 --> 00:35:24,439
that's right. Well, I mean, like. The issue
didn't really have time to be addressed because

389
00:35:24,479 --> 00:35:29,562
the whole film only takes place over the course
of, what, three days? So, yeah, I mean, if

390
00:35:29,622 --> 00:35:33,124
it took place over a long period of time, things
would have played out differently for sure.

391
00:35:33,484 --> 00:35:40,147
Moving on to Cesar Rudy Reyes, he's played by
George Lopez. He's not one of my favorite comedians.

392
00:35:40,207 --> 00:35:44,530
I mean, he's decent. I thought he was going
to be just so-so in this film, but like you,

393
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:49,453
I'm actually really glad he was in it because
I thought he did a terrific job as Rudy and

394
00:35:49,493 --> 00:35:54,660
was responsible for some of the film's most
successful humor. I love George Lopez. I think

395
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,242
he's one of the most hilarious comedians ever.
He definitely played the character of Rudy

396
00:35:59,843 --> 00:36:04,766
as such a character. You know, he's paranoid
about the government and core to industry's

397
00:36:04,806 --> 00:36:10,990
technology. He was a real help to Jaime and
everyone, not only in handling technology like

398
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:17,726
the bug ship, but also in inventing his own
tech and maximizing his truck taco, which I

399
00:36:17,766 --> 00:36:21,549
actually got a lot more laughs than I thought
it would. Like they really milked that thing,

400
00:36:21,589 --> 00:36:27,934
but in a good way. I just love hearing George
Lopez scream, die taco. Just his screaming

401
00:36:27,994 --> 00:36:32,397
is fantastic. It's just so funny. It's really
good. You're right. He was such a character,

402
00:36:32,417 --> 00:36:36,560
they could almost give him his own show. I just
thought George Lopez was going to play him

403
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:42,425
like George Lopez. But I would say this is probably
George Lopez's best acting job that I've ever

404
00:36:42,505 --> 00:36:46,511
personally seen. Yeah, I would agree with that
even outside of the comedic bits, you know,

405
00:36:46,711 --> 00:36:50,292
the parts where he actually had heart to heart
talks with Jaime. I thought we're really well

406
00:36:50,312 --> 00:36:56,255
done. Yeah, there was a pretty touching scene
with Rudy and Jaime on top of the court mansion

407
00:36:56,755 --> 00:37:00,977
when Rudy describes himself as basically like
a loser who sleeps on his brother's living

408
00:37:01,017 --> 00:37:06,059
room couch. But when Jaime tells him that he's
never seen him like that, that he's always

409
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:11,581
seen his uncle as this badass, there was just
something like truly special and loving and

410
00:37:11,601 --> 00:37:18,318
empowering. Not just about family, but non-judgmental
family in particular. And you could see that

411
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:24,442
love in the performances of both Sholo and George
Lopez. Is Rudy from the comics? No, I don't

412
00:37:24,462 --> 00:37:29,626
believe he is. Jaime has an aunt, but I don't
think, as far as I'm aware, that we ever see

413
00:37:29,646 --> 00:37:35,510
him with an uncle. I mean, Alberto Milagro,
Jaime's mom, are in the comics, although his

414
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:39,773
mom has a different name. Her name is Bianca
in the comic, and in the movie her name is

415
00:37:39,953 --> 00:37:45,207
Rocio. But yeah, Rudy is an original character.
I was hoping to get some kind of explanation

416
00:37:45,267 --> 00:37:50,310
as to who the hell this guy is and why he's
so good at building random technology and where

417
00:37:50,350 --> 00:37:55,272
that came from. And yeah, he seems like a character
that would be rooted in the comics. I'm sure

418
00:37:55,312 --> 00:38:00,494
he will be after this movie. I'd be surprised
if he wasn't. Moving on to the rest of Jaime's

419
00:38:00,534 --> 00:38:05,796
family, I don't have much to say about each
of them. I think the standout is Milagro, his

420
00:38:05,836 --> 00:38:11,819
sister. She was played by Belisa Escobedo. I
thought she did a great job here, and like

421
00:38:11,859 --> 00:38:17,662
George Lopez brought a lot of humor to the film.
Her snarkiness makes her a good foil for both

422
00:38:17,682 --> 00:38:23,025
Jaime and Jenny, but in spite of her attitude,
you never question her loyalty to her brother

423
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:28,848
or her family. I thought the father was a standout
as well. Oh, Alberto? He was played by Damien

424
00:38:28,948 --> 00:38:33,651
Alcazar. Yeah, he tied in heavily to the themes
of Purpose and Destiny. It was interesting

425
00:38:33,871 --> 00:38:39,894
to see him at the end kind of state that he
realized his purpose posthumously. was to be

426
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:45,058
there and provide strength for Jaime in his
moment of need. That scene almost broke me

427
00:38:45,099 --> 00:38:50,623
in the theater. I didn't cry, but I was really
close. That was such a beautiful scene. I don't

428
00:38:50,643 --> 00:38:54,466
have too much to say about the mother, but of
course I think one of the standout characters

429
00:38:54,506 --> 00:38:59,891
of the film as a whole was Nana. Not necessarily
in a positive way for me personally at least.

430
00:39:00,531 --> 00:39:05,756
I have other family members who loved her, but
I think the joke of her being like this badass

431
00:39:05,796 --> 00:39:10,739
revolutionary who could wield a gatling gun.
was beating a dead horse. Yeah, it should have

432
00:39:10,759 --> 00:39:15,340
been given one reference, kind of was like a
wink and a nod, and then dropped entirely.

433
00:39:15,661 --> 00:39:20,082
I think it would have actually been funnier
that way. Absolutely. Moving on to the villains

434
00:39:20,142 --> 00:39:26,485
of the film, Ignacio Carapaz was played by Raul
Max Trujillo. He was an interesting character

435
00:39:26,725 --> 00:39:31,927
somewhat, but only up until the very end. Like
throughout the whole film, he has this weird

436
00:39:31,947 --> 00:39:38,102
relationship with Victoria, but he's very stoic
and quiet, something of a mystery. And he says

437
00:39:38,162 --> 00:39:43,644
mysterious things like, your family makes you
weak. So there's this hint of backstory there,

438
00:39:44,124 --> 00:39:49,347
which we don't get until the very end, and I
honestly felt that I was a cop out. I wish

439
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:53,269
they would have established early on that he
suffered from memory loss, and I think that

440
00:39:53,289 --> 00:39:57,971
would have made the end make a little bit more
sense. Yeah, the character was too generic

441
00:39:58,011 --> 00:40:02,513
for too long of a film to make him any sort
of interesting villain. Too much of his character

442
00:40:02,553 --> 00:40:06,503
building was done pretty much after the fact.
Although it was an interesting story and it

443
00:40:06,523 --> 00:40:11,727
seemed like the film was touching on injustices
faced by Latin American countries at the hands

444
00:40:11,787 --> 00:40:16,750
of the American military complex. Right. But
it was kind of like shoehorned in there. Not

445
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:21,233
that the film needed to be about that, but overall
the character building there was just too little

446
00:40:21,273 --> 00:40:26,797
too late. I agree. I agree. Essentially, we
learn at the very end that Carapax was a little

447
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:32,301
boy living in a rural Latin American country
whose mom was the victim of a Cordo Industries

448
00:40:32,381 --> 00:40:36,835
missile. I don't remember it being clear why
his mom was bombed, and I'm not sure if it's

449
00:40:36,895 --> 00:40:42,636
entirely necessary, but Victoria essentially
abducts Ignacio as a little boy and performs

450
00:40:42,676 --> 00:40:48,318
horrendous experiments on him that takes his
arm and implants him with Ohmak tech. His entire

451
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:53,719
existence is a testament to Victoria Kord's
evilness essentially, and it was pretty hardcore

452
00:40:53,739 --> 00:40:58,361
how he was the one to give her comeuppets at
the end by dragging her screaming into the

453
00:40:58,401 --> 00:41:04,890
fire and blowing her and himself up. That was
crazy. Is Caropax an OMAC? In the comics, no.

454
00:41:05,391 --> 00:41:10,492
The OMAC is a very different thing in the comics,
and I'm still not quite sure how I feel about

455
00:41:10,792 --> 00:41:17,294
them using it in this movie. OMAC stands for
One-Man Army Corps, and it was done really

456
00:41:17,374 --> 00:41:23,556
well during Jaime Reyes' debut during the Infinite
Crisis storyline, where the OMAC technology

457
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:30,457
was a nanovirus that was implanted in just random
people across the planet as like sleeper cells.

458
00:41:31,018 --> 00:41:35,760
It was very akin to like, Secret Invasion in
a way. And of course it was done very different

459
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:40,863
here. Although I don't think you wouldn't be
able to pick that back up in a later film as

460
00:41:40,903 --> 00:41:47,107
a different version. In the comics, Kera Pax
got his armor from Pago Island. The same island

461
00:41:47,127 --> 00:41:52,190
where the fortress was at the end of this movie.
It was an island owned by Jarvis Kord, Ted's

462
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:57,953
uncle, who was the one responsible for Dan Garrett's
death. The original Blue Beetle. But speaking

463
00:41:57,993 --> 00:42:03,720
of Jarvis Kord... Let's move on to Victoria
Cord, who is played by Susan Sarandon. I want

464
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:07,862
to jump in right here and say that this is by
far the worst performance I've ever seen Susan

465
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:13,226
Sarandon give. She was horrible in this movie.
Good God, this villain sucked. I feel like

466
00:42:13,246 --> 00:42:17,988
you're being a little harsh, but not by much.
I mean, Susan Sarandon, she's a great actress.

467
00:42:18,468 --> 00:42:23,811
I think she did a decent job with what was called
for the character in the script. You know,

468
00:42:23,831 --> 00:42:28,738
essentially, she was just supposed to be this
corporate elitist and racist. who's more concerned

469
00:42:28,758 --> 00:42:33,882
with money and her legacy than human lives.
She wasn't supposed to be likable. It was a

470
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:39,146
very cold performance, though, especially in
contrast to the more colorful cast. She was

471
00:42:39,186 --> 00:42:43,489
so detached from everything, it felt like she
was like reading cue cards and her approach

472
00:42:43,509 --> 00:42:48,953
was to be as generic as possible. I didn't think
it was that bad. It was bad. Not as bad as

473
00:42:48,993 --> 00:42:55,177
you're describing it, though. I think she's
still emoted. She still acted, you know. OK,

474
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:59,659
haters going to hate. We learned that Victoria
helped start Corda Industries as a weapons

475
00:42:59,699 --> 00:43:04,743
manufacturer with her father. Though when her
father died, he left the company to Victoria's

476
00:43:04,783 --> 00:43:11,126
brother, Ted. It's never made clear whether
Victoria had some responsibility in Ted's disappearance,

477
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:16,630
though I'm guessing it had more to do with his
adventures as Blue Beetle than her. But regardless,

478
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:21,853
Victoria makes the most of Ted's absence and
steers the direction of the company back to

479
00:43:21,873 --> 00:43:27,497
the weapons industry. with the intent of creating
the ultimate cybernetic soldiers. I'm confused

480
00:43:27,617 --> 00:43:33,301
honestly why they had to create the character
of Victoria Cord when she's essentially Jarvis

481
00:43:33,321 --> 00:43:38,444
Cord from the comics as I mentioned earlier.
Jarvis isn't a major character though, so I

482
00:43:38,484 --> 00:43:42,667
guess it's not that big of a deal. I'm just
wondering why of all the routes you could have

483
00:43:42,707 --> 00:43:47,551
taken with a Blue Beetle villain they decided
to go this route. And again, I think they just

484
00:43:47,571 --> 00:43:52,747
wanted to make someone super unlikable like
the ultimate entitled Karen. If Susan Strandon

485
00:43:52,767 --> 00:43:56,935
doesn't get nominated for a Razzie for this
role, I'm going to eat my shirt. You heard

486
00:43:56,976 --> 00:44:02,927
it here first, folks. Joseph's going to eat
his shirt. In the meantime, let's move on to

487
00:44:02,967 --> 00:44:03,889
the story highlights.

488
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:17,451
In a frozen tundra, Chord Industries, led by
Victoria Chord, locate an alien artifact known

489
00:44:17,511 --> 00:44:24,213
as a scarab within a giant stone sphere. Not
long after, we see Jaime Reyes return home

490
00:44:24,253 --> 00:44:30,735
to Palmera City after earning a pre-law degree
from Gotham Law. He learns that his family

491
00:44:30,775 --> 00:44:36,597
is losing their home in the Edge Keys neighborhood
after his father lost his job and because Chord

492
00:44:36,697 --> 00:44:41,386
Industries' development in the city increased
housing prices. I can't remember if we ever

493
00:44:41,446 --> 00:44:46,708
learned how the scarab ended up in that stone.
No, we have no idea. We're not sure if Ted

494
00:44:46,748 --> 00:44:52,991
Kord put it there. It was implied that maybe
he did and it set up decoys across the entire

495
00:44:53,011 --> 00:44:58,293
globe that Victoria Kord was searching through.
I'm not sure if it's explicitly said. There

496
00:44:58,313 --> 00:45:03,035
was a lot that was flashing by the screen during
the opening credits, so the answer could lie

497
00:45:03,055 --> 00:45:07,617
in that. They were cool opening credits. I like
how they kind of give a history of the scarabs

498
00:45:07,757 --> 00:45:13,132
and everything. Yeah, and how lethal they are,
just devastating a planet. That was cool. Jaime

499
00:45:13,172 --> 00:45:18,555
takes a job with his sister, Milagro, cleaning
beachside mansions in order to contribute money

500
00:45:18,575 --> 00:45:24,618
to his family. While cleaning the home of Victoria
Cord, he witnesses an argument between Victoria

501
00:45:24,759 --> 00:45:30,842
and her niece, Jenny, over the one-man army
corps, or OMAC, weapons project that Cord Industries

502
00:45:30,882 --> 00:45:36,085
is working on, and also over the disappearance
of Jenny's father, Ted, the former head of

503
00:45:36,145 --> 00:45:42,472
Cord Industries. When Jaime stands up for Jenny,
Victoria fires him and Milagro, though Jenny

504
00:45:42,512 --> 00:45:47,455
promises Jaime to help him get a job at Chord
Industries if he visits her there the next

505
00:45:47,535 --> 00:45:52,758
day. When Jaime goes to Chord Tower the next
day to meet with Jenny, she frantically gives

506
00:45:52,778 --> 00:45:57,681
him a small box containing the scarab that she
had just stolen from the Chord Laboratories,

507
00:45:58,021 --> 00:46:03,965
which was studying the scarab in order to extract
its alien code. Despite being told by Jenny

508
00:46:04,025 --> 00:46:09,484
not to open the box, When Jaime brings it home,
he's pressured by his family to do so. The

509
00:46:09,524 --> 00:46:15,609
scarab bonds to Jaime's spine, painfully forming
a reconfiguring exoskeleton around him and

510
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:21,113
performing a system calibration check that causes
him to tear through his family's roof and Palmera

511
00:46:21,193 --> 00:46:26,236
City, where his automatic defense system slices
a bus in half. The scene where he goes into

512
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:30,499
space I thought was really well done. I feel
like they did a good job capturing the panic

513
00:46:30,759 --> 00:46:35,982
that Jaime was feeling in the moment. Yeah,
it was well done. I didn't like how they basically

514
00:46:36,042 --> 00:46:41,744
plagiarized the scene from Shazam when he was
falling out of the sky and then with his arms

515
00:46:41,884 --> 00:46:46,565
up right before he crashed back onto Earth,
he stopped like an inch off the ground. It

516
00:46:46,585 --> 00:46:50,326
was played a little bit different in the Shazam
movie and that it like cut to black and stuff

517
00:46:50,366 --> 00:46:54,767
like that, but not by much. And yeah, I would
say it was ripped off. I did think it was funny

518
00:46:54,787 --> 00:46:59,108
with the guys at the bus stop on drugs when
they're like, has it kicked in yet? And then

519
00:46:59,128 --> 00:47:02,209
once the whole thing with the Blue Beetle happens,
they're like, yeah, I think it's kicked in.

520
00:47:02,229 --> 00:47:06,731
That was funny. When Jaime returns home, he's
frightened at the sight of the Scarab bound

521
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:12,094
to his spine, and he steals his Uncle Rudy's
truck to find Jenny for her help in getting

522
00:47:12,154 --> 00:47:17,577
it removed. Jaime finds Jenny on the run from
Kord's lethal security force, and helps her

523
00:47:17,637 --> 00:47:22,660
escape back to his house where she tells him
and his family that the Scarab is an ancient

524
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:28,543
parasitic weapon capable of destroying the planet
that has chosen to bond with Jaime for some

525
00:47:28,583 --> 00:47:33,966
reason. She explains that her father studied
the Scarab. and might know how to get it off,

526
00:47:34,306 --> 00:47:39,808
but they would need to get a key from Core Tower
to access his hidden laboratory. Meanwhile,

527
00:47:40,128 --> 00:47:47,290
Victoria orders Lieutenant Ignacio Carapax to
find Jenny. Why is it that every DC film wants

528
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:52,872
to portray its lead male star in the nude due
to the way their super suit works? Like we

529
00:47:52,892 --> 00:47:58,506
saw that in The Flash recently. We did. I mean,
but we saw a lot more. of Barry Allen and the

530
00:47:58,546 --> 00:48:03,347
Flash and more of Ben Affleck as Batman than
we did of Jaime. I don't know, I feel like

531
00:48:03,727 --> 00:48:09,789
studios always have the hardest time with superhero
costumes and the whole just nature of them

532
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:14,290
putting on the suit. Like, they're like, oh,
obviously the clothes aren't underneath the

533
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:17,931
suit, so they have to take them off, right?
It's just, you don't think about that when

534
00:48:17,951 --> 00:48:22,793
you're reading comics. With help from Uncle
Rudy, Jenny and Jaime managed to steal the

535
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:28,722
watch key only to then be attacked by Carapax.
who is equipped with cybernetic omak armor

536
00:48:28,842 --> 00:48:34,904
and weaponry. Though Jaime's scarab armor activates
defensively in response, Jaime is still unable

537
00:48:34,944 --> 00:48:40,685
to fully control his new powers and is nearly
killed by carapacts until Uncle Rudy intervenes

538
00:48:40,765 --> 00:48:46,867
and the three escape. I have a question. Sure.
Why does Victoria Cord even need the scarab

539
00:48:47,187 --> 00:48:52,589
if the omak armor is already so successful?
I mean, it nearly defeated Blue Beetle at this

540
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:58,498
point. I don't know, that's a good question.
she wanted the scarab for herself. Like she

541
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:03,080
wanted to bond with it so she could be super
powerful. But after I learned that she just

542
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:08,861
wanted the code to make her OMAC machines even
more powerful, I was wondering the same thing.

543
00:49:09,261 --> 00:49:14,743
I think she's just obsessed with power and that
may not be a very good reason, but I think

544
00:49:14,763 --> 00:49:20,324
she's known that the alien technology is far
superior than anything core industries could

545
00:49:20,344 --> 00:49:25,739
come up with. Moving on to the next scene, at
Jenny's childhood home, now a run-down mansion,

546
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:31,743
Jenny unlocks her father's high-tech laboratory,
where Haima and Rudy learn that Ted Kord was

547
00:49:31,763 --> 00:49:38,067
the hero once known as Blue Beetle. While Haima
learns more about Jenny's family, Rudy learns

548
00:49:38,167 --> 00:49:44,732
via Ted's computer that the Scarab, named Kaji
Dah, is alien in origin and can't be removed

549
00:49:44,832 --> 00:49:50,375
while Haima is still alive, as evidenced by
the Scarab's original host, Dan Garrett.

550
00:49:53,686 --> 00:49:58,628
where he sees Victoria Court's helicopter headed
toward his family home in the edge keys and

551
00:49:58,668 --> 00:50:03,890
he realizes Victoria knows that he's been helping
Jenny. Jaime leaps off the roof in order to

552
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:09,492
activate Khajiitah through its protective measures
and he flies home. How do you feel about the

553
00:50:09,532 --> 00:50:13,394
movie's treatment of the Blue Beetle legacy
here? I thought it was pretty interesting that

554
00:50:13,434 --> 00:50:18,576
they brought it up at all considering maybe
they didn't need to. I actually really liked

555
00:50:18,596 --> 00:50:22,970
what they did here. I agree that they probably
didn't need to. But I respect them for how

556
00:50:22,990 --> 00:50:28,553
they did it. They really didn't miss anything,
honestly. And I didn't expect them to touch

557
00:50:28,593 --> 00:50:32,816
on as much as they did. I thought we would just
get Ted Kord, the fact that we got so many

558
00:50:32,856 --> 00:50:37,578
references to Dan Garrett too, and them acknowledging
the fact that he was the first one to bond

559
00:50:37,598 --> 00:50:41,820
with the beetle, I thought was pretty neat.
Yeah, yeah, it was really cool. There's so

560
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:46,043
much stuff in this movie that just had me super
giddy because I never thought I was ever going

561
00:50:46,063 --> 00:50:51,706
to see it, like the bug ship. Like we saw something
very similar in the Watchmen movie Night Owl

562
00:50:51,746 --> 00:50:57,328
is based on Blue Beetle, but to see the actual
buck ship was super cool. Yeah, and that little

563
00:50:57,448 --> 00:51:02,270
trapeze thing that comes out of the bottom of
it that Blue Beetle swings around on. Right.

564
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:06,092
Yeah, there's something special about finally
seeing that in live action. Back to the movie,

565
00:51:06,492 --> 00:51:12,254
Victoria uses her private military force to
invade the Reyes' home and rounds up its occupants.

566
00:51:12,675 --> 00:51:17,977
When Jaime arrives, Victoria orders her troops
to attack him and his family in order to see

567
00:51:18,017 --> 00:51:23,612
what the Scarab is capable of. Though Jaime
manages to protect his family, Kiripax successfully

568
00:51:23,652 --> 00:51:29,175
disables and captures Jaime, while his father,
Alberto, suffers from cardiac arrest during

569
00:51:29,215 --> 00:51:34,958
their escape. As Victoria takes Jaime to Pago
Island, her private island fortress, Alberto

570
00:51:35,018 --> 00:51:40,841
dies, and before the family can grieve, the
grandmother and matriarch known as Nana encourages

571
00:51:40,881 --> 00:51:49,162
them to save Jaime. This was a pretty intense
scene. The fact that Alberto died was... incredibly

572
00:51:49,202 --> 00:51:54,027
powerful and something I didn't see coming.
I question the legality of Victoria Court's

573
00:51:54,107 --> 00:51:59,752
actions. Like really, how much can the Reyes
family sue court industries for because of

574
00:51:59,852 --> 00:52:03,876
all the shit that went down here? I mean, if
they could afford the lawyer. I mean, there

575
00:52:03,916 --> 00:52:08,160
isn't a lawyer around that wouldn't take that
case. That's a huge payday right there. Unless

576
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:13,084
Victoria Court pays them more to not do that.
Well, Jaime took pre-law, so you think he might

577
00:52:13,104 --> 00:52:17,003
be able to do a good enough job of it? Yeah,
maybe if he got his postgraduate law degree

578
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:21,084
and passed the bar to get his license. It would
take a lot of work. Yet. And then you would

579
00:52:21,104 --> 00:52:27,327
never have to work again. Ha ha ha. That's fair.
Victoria binds Jaime to a machine in a laboratory

580
00:52:27,447 --> 00:52:33,370
on Pago Island and begins extracting the scarab's
energy and data in order to improve her OMAC

581
00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:39,953
machines. A process that nearly kills Jaime.
Meanwhile, Jenny takes the Reyes family back

582
00:52:39,973 --> 00:52:44,723
to her father's secret lab. where they use the
Blue Beetle hovercraft known as the Bug Ship

583
00:52:45,064 --> 00:52:50,547
and Blue Beetle's experimental weaponry to travel
to Pago Island and rescue Jaime. As the Bug

584
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:56,011
Ship storms the fortress, Jaime's mind drifts
into the afterlife, where he meets his father.

585
00:52:56,471 --> 00:53:01,474
Alberto encourages his son, telling him that
it's not his time to die and that he needs

586
00:53:01,514 --> 00:53:07,538
to fully bond mentally with Kha'Jida, which
Jaime does just as Jenny and Milagro blow up

587
00:53:07,558 --> 00:53:12,980
the fortress's power generators and the Scarab
Code fully downloads into Carapax, amplifying

588
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:18,842
the power of his Omac armor and driving him
into a murderous rampage. I love the joke here

589
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:25,305
where Victoria's scientist whom she calls Sanchez,
when he makes that final stand against her

590
00:53:25,565 --> 00:53:30,888
giving his full name with all of his family's
surnames and everything, it was a great moment.

591
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:41,273
Though Jenny is captured by Victoria, Jaime
manages to rescue his sister before facing

592
00:53:41,353 --> 00:53:46,477
off against Carapax and nearly getting killed.
When Jaime is saved thanks to a distraction

593
00:53:46,497 --> 00:53:52,661
by Rudy, Jaime believes Carapax kills his uncle
and gets a second wind after seemingly witnessing

594
00:53:52,701 --> 00:53:57,645
the death of one of his family members. Though
Jaime gets the upper hand and nearly kills

595
00:53:57,685 --> 00:54:03,949
Carapax, Kajira reveals to Jaime Carapax's memories
that it managed to uncover during the data

596
00:54:03,989 --> 00:54:09,850
download. of how Carapax has been abused by
Victoria since he was a child, including being

597
00:54:09,890 --> 00:54:14,874
responsible for the death of his mother. After
Jenny manages to bring down Victoria's getaway

598
00:54:14,914 --> 00:54:21,460
copter, Jaime lets Carapax kill Victoria by
overloading his suit and generating an explosion

599
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:26,805
that also destroys all the OMAC weapons held
at the fortress, though Jaime and his family

600
00:54:26,905 --> 00:54:32,710
escape the explosion in the bugship and they
finally mourn Alberto's death together. The

601
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:38,873
final battles here were so unbelievably cool.
I mentioned how Blue Beetle borrows a lot from

602
00:54:38,933 --> 00:54:44,896
Marvel. And I have to say, I'm ecstatic that
DC character finally gets his own like hallway

603
00:54:44,936 --> 00:54:50,819
fight scene. Yeah, it was so good. Honestly,
if that like corridor fight scene doesn't make

604
00:54:50,899 --> 00:54:56,042
your nominations list for best DC moment of
the year for the Brothers Awards in December,

605
00:54:56,182 --> 00:55:00,905
I'll be surprised. Oh, it absolutely will. I
just love how like Haima was just pissed off.

606
00:55:00,925 --> 00:55:06,079
He's like, let's go. It's like smashing his
energy fists together. And the song, I Ain't

607
00:55:06,119 --> 00:55:11,541
Going Out Like That by Cypress Hill, is definitely
my new fight song. Like I'm getting into a

608
00:55:11,561 --> 00:55:16,843
fight with someone, I'm putting that song on.
The moment leading up to that where Kajida

609
00:55:17,184 --> 00:55:22,626
repeats his mother's line in Spanish, it gave
me chills. It was really well done, that whole

610
00:55:22,666 --> 00:55:26,688
scene. And it really kind of showed how well
the two had bonded by that point because Haime

611
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:30,829
was starting to influence the Scarab to the
point where the Scarab was starting to speak

612
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:37,086
Spanish. That's such a neat concept. Yeah, yeah,
really cool. Also really cool that final fight

613
00:55:37,106 --> 00:55:41,430
between Carapax and Blue Beetle, where Blue
Beetle is like busting out Buster swords and

614
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:47,855
like doing flying somersault sword slashes.
So unbelievably awesome. I was just so happy

615
00:55:47,875 --> 00:55:52,759
in the theater during this final fight. After
Alberto's funeral, Jenny takes control of Cordova

616
00:55:52,779 --> 00:55:58,564
Industries and offers to rebuild Threya's home
while also giving Grooty a new truck, both

617
00:55:58,604 --> 00:56:04,499
of which were destroyed earlier. Jaime and Jenny
finally kiss before he flies her to her childhood

618
00:56:04,539 --> 00:56:10,242
home. In the mid-credits scene, we learn via
a broadcast on Ted's lab computer that Ted

619
00:56:10,282 --> 00:56:17,805
Kord is still alive. Now I have to say, the
painting of Ted Kord in the mansion looks exactly

620
00:56:17,845 --> 00:56:23,147
like Jason Sudeikis. Am I wrong? I wouldn't
say exactly because it was a very impressionist

621
00:56:23,287 --> 00:56:30,386
style painting, so it could literally be anybody.
I mean, it's exactly Jason. Sudeikis in an

622
00:56:30,426 --> 00:56:35,850
impressionist style, right? Okay. I don't know
where you're getting this Jason Sudeikis thing

623
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:39,733
from. Well, he's been rumored to be in the film,
but obviously that wasn't the case. I don't

624
00:56:39,753 --> 00:56:44,397
know if maybe they cut his role. I have no idea
whose voice that was at the very end. I don't

625
00:56:44,417 --> 00:56:48,860
know if that was supposed to be Ted Kord or
maybe even Booster Gold because they refer

626
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:54,344
to Ted Kord in the third person, right? I'm
hoping that Ted Kord kind of got trapped in

627
00:56:54,384 --> 00:56:59,908
time alongside Booster. and that this film will
segue into the Booster Gold television series.

628
00:56:59,989 --> 00:57:04,572
That would be awesome. I almost feel like Jaime
Reyes needs his own Booster Gold, right? Because

629
00:57:04,592 --> 00:57:08,836
like Ted Kord, Blue Beetle and Booster Gold
were best friends. But now that Ted Kord's

630
00:57:08,876 --> 00:57:13,380
legacy has kind of been passed down, it would
be nice to have that dynamic still with Jaime

631
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:18,043
and appear. I think you could go a number of
routes with that. You could go the Peacemaker

632
00:57:18,083 --> 00:57:23,108
route, who kind of served as a mentor and partner
for Jaime in the comics. But you could also

633
00:57:23,168 --> 00:57:28,762
go like the Teen Titans route. Like maybe even
Blue Beetle could appear in the upcoming Batman

634
00:57:28,802 --> 00:57:32,884
and Robin film, like in a post-credits scene
or something like that, as Damien is maybe

635
00:57:32,984 --> 00:57:38,085
forming the Teen Titans. Who knows? It could
work, I think. I would be surprised if we saw

636
00:57:38,545 --> 00:57:43,166
Blue Beetle appear like in Peacemaker Season
2. I do think that there's room for two Blue

637
00:57:43,206 --> 00:57:48,288
Beetles, like I think Ted Kord and Jaime could
share the role, so that you can have Ted Kord

638
00:57:48,648 --> 00:57:53,989
in the Booster Gold series. There is an after
credits scene, but it's nothing. It's just...

639
00:57:54,334 --> 00:58:01,716
El Chapulín Colorado in a cute claymation form.
Colorado. It was just El Chapulín Colorado

640
00:58:01,996 --> 00:58:06,017
in a cute claymation form. Yeah, I kind of regret
sticking around for that one. I don't think

641
00:58:06,037 --> 00:58:11,818
it was worth it. Dad didn't though. He loved
it. So I loved it. But that does it for the

642
00:58:11,858 --> 00:58:17,720
movie. Again, I was really happy with the way
it turned out. I thought it was a terrific

643
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:22,882
adaptation of the source material. I honestly
can't think of a better way to approach. Blue

644
00:58:22,902 --> 00:58:27,984
Beetle comics than what they did in this movie.
Overall, with the film's thrilling visual effects

645
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:33,426
action and touching cultural look at family,
the film introduces one of the genre's coolest

646
00:58:33,746 --> 00:58:41,050
and most relatable superheroes yet, particularly
for DC. I'm rating the film 4 out of 5 stars,

647
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:47,913
a fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Yeah, you
said particularly for DC, I think you need

648
00:58:47,933 --> 00:58:52,311
that asterisk there in your review. I'm a little
bit surprised you're giving it four stars and

649
00:58:52,331 --> 00:58:56,093
not three and a half stars because this is basically
the definition of a three and a half star film.

650
00:58:56,493 --> 00:59:01,377
I think as you stated through the course of
your review, you have lost objectivity and

651
00:59:01,537 --> 00:59:06,320
I think you should have your Rotten Tomatoes
license revoked. To which I could only reply,

652
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:14,265
haters gonna hate. And it's again, like I mentioned,
the perfect Blue Beetle movie. But that does

653
00:59:14,305 --> 00:59:19,336

Guardians of the Galaxy team duel episode,

663
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:15,294
which is going to be episode 350. Next week,
we are pitting the Doom Patrol member, Danny

664
01:00:15,314 --> 01:00:19,396
the Street, who if you've read the books or
you've seen the Doom Patrol show, you will

665
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:24,158
know is actually a sentient street and we're
going to pay him against the sentient island

666
01:00:24,358 --> 01:00:30,941
of Krakoa. So essentially it's going to be two
locations facing off against each other and

667
01:00:31,581 --> 01:00:38,144
I've not been more terrified for how speculation
is going to go in my entire life. In the words

668
01:00:38,184 --> 01:00:43,838
of Rudy, we'll burn that bridge once we get
to it. Yeah. But that does it for this episode,

669
01:00:43,858 --> 01:00:48,499
we want to give a big thanks to our executive
producers Ken Johnson, John Sturowski, Zachary
