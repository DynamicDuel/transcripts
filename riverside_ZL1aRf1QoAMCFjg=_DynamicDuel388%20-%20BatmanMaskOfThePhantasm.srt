00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,957
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:29,202
Welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,242 --> 00:00:34,628
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:40,353
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous
Joe. And in this episode, we are doing a throwback

5
00:00:40,413 --> 00:00:47,580
review to the 1993 animated theatrical film,
Batman, Mask of the Phantasm. We were interested

6
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,685
in reviewing it now. because we just got done
reviewing X-Men 97. And of course, both that

7
00:00:52,725 --> 00:00:57,969
cartoon and Batman, the animated series for
which this film is a tie in to were both popular

8
00:00:58,029 --> 00:01:02,593
Saturday morning cartoons that a lot of us 90s
kids grew up with. Yeah, it's a nostalgia episode.

9
00:01:02,953 --> 00:01:07,977
The question is, does Batman mask the phantasm
hold up to the animated series in the same

10
00:01:08,017 --> 00:01:13,594
way that X-Men 97 held up to the 90s series?
We'll find out later on this episode. Before

11
00:01:13,614 --> 00:01:16,936
that we're going to break down the comic book
movie news from this past week, of which there

12
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:23,801
was only one major news item, and that was the
trailer for Venom 3. There was some casting

13
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:29,506
announcements made for the new Superman movie,
but other than Beck Bennett as Steve Lombard,

14
00:01:29,586 --> 00:01:34,069
I didn't really have too much to say about the
casting choices. But as always, we list our

28
00:03:08,522 --> 00:03:13,867
On the Sanjo World podcast, host Zachary Heppard
speculates on fights between fan favorite anime

29
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:19,372
and manga characters. The show is currently
on a season hiatus, so this is the perfect

30
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:25,798
time for you anime fans to catch up on Sanjo
World's 40 episode library. And on the Console

31
00:03:25,818 --> 00:03:30,042
Combat podcast, hosts John and Dean find out
who would win in fights between popular video

32
00:03:30,082 --> 00:03:34,566
game characters. In yesterday's episode, they
found out who would win in a fight- between

33
00:03:34,646 --> 00:03:40,447
Mr. Incredible from the Incredibles video game
against the Thing from, I'm guessing the 2005

34
00:03:41,047 --> 00:03:46,569
Fantastic Four movie tie-in video game, or maybe
like the Thing from the Marvel Nemesis game.

35
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:51,690
I'm not sure. Either way, sounds like a great
matchup. Visit dynamicpodcasts.com or click

00:03:56,612 --> 00:04:02,873
But with that out of the way, quick to the no
prize. A no prize is an award Marvel used to

38
00:04:02,893 --> 00:04:08,700
give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel
No Prize, is a digital award we post on Instagram

39
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,423
for the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week's question

40
00:04:13,443 --> 00:04:18,666
was, who's your favorite Green Lantern and why?
And of course this was coming off of the news

41
00:04:18,706 --> 00:04:23,929
that the showrunners for the upcoming Lanterns
television series in the DCU was Damon Lindelof

42
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:28,331
and Chris Mundy. We got four different answers
for this week's question, so we're going to

43
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:33,766
break down our honorable mentions before announcing
this week's No Prize winner. Our first honorable

44
00:04:33,826 --> 00:04:40,188
mention goes to Judson Batty who said, Hi guys,
Judson Batty here. I'd say my favorite Green

45
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:46,070
Latin is Sinestro. I feel like the stories when
he is a Green Latin and not yellow in the Sinestro

46
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:51,592
core just some of the most interesting, whether
it's the early ones where he's training how

47
00:04:51,652 --> 00:04:58,691
Jordan or prequels with Abin Suh. or even the
new 52 when he gets the Green Lantern ring

48
00:04:58,711 --> 00:05:02,373
back. I feel like they just make for a really
interesting reads because it really pushes

49
00:05:02,393 --> 00:05:06,635
the boundaries of what the ring and the core
allow to happen. Good to hear from you again,

50
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:11,878
Jutsson from the land down under. For everyone
who is confused by us claiming that Jutsson

51
00:05:11,898 --> 00:05:16,721
was from Austria or from New Zealand, those
people need to watch Dumb and Dumber and Flight

52
00:05:16,741 --> 00:05:20,963
of the Conchords. Yeah, totally. But his answer
of Sinestro is actually an interesting one,

53
00:05:20,983 --> 00:05:26,006
considering Sinestro is, of course, one of the
lead enemies, if not the lead enemy. of the

54
00:05:26,046 --> 00:05:31,287
Green Lantern Corps. He started off as a Green
Lantern but then defected, and recently for

55
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:36,549
a time came back to being a Green Lantern, and
even a White Lantern. He's a very complex character,

56
00:05:36,649 --> 00:05:41,330
if you don't know too much about him, I definitely
suggest listening to our Sinestro vs Magneto

57
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:46,952
duel episode. Yeah, he trained Hal Jordan. He
was, I think, really good friends with Abin

58
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:52,913
Sur, who was Hal Jordan's predecessor. And that's
pretty much what I remember from your backstory

59
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:58,287
on him, Jonathan. Wow, you also need to go back
and listen to that episode. That was like five

60
00:05:58,347 --> 00:06:03,990
years ago. Come on, give me a break. Good answer,
Judson. Our next honorable mention goes to

61
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:08,692
Mickey Mathingian, who said, it was because
of Mickey and my favorite Green Lantern is

62
00:06:08,712 --> 00:06:13,794
Jon Stewart. I think you guys have asked this
before, but I'm going to answer it again. He

63
00:06:13,814 --> 00:06:17,715
was my favorite because of the Justice League
cartoon. I grew up on that. So he was like

64
00:06:17,735 --> 00:06:23,294
the first Green Lantern I was introduced to.
I also just really like his story. with him

65
00:06:23,314 --> 00:06:28,076
being one of DC's first African-American superheroes
and the fictional backstory, too, with him

66
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:33,439
being an architect and a really good sniper.
Yeah, thanks, guys. Yeah, I didn't grow up

67
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:37,521
really with the Justice League cartoon that
was a little bit after my time when I was in

68
00:06:37,561 --> 00:06:42,283
high school. So I never really considered Jon
Stewart to be like the Green Lantern. But just

69
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:47,485
from doing this podcast and doing research on
the various Green Lanterns for our duel episodes.

70
00:06:48,018 --> 00:06:53,240
Jon Stewart has become my personal favorite
Green Lantern. It used to be Kyle Raynor and

71
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:57,862
then it was Hal Jordan, but I just love the
backstory of Jon Stewart, how he's this Green

72
00:06:57,882 --> 00:07:03,005
Lantern of prophecy and yet his military and
architecture background kind of blend the best

73
00:07:03,065 --> 00:07:08,587
of all worlds for each of the human Green Lantern
characters. If we were left with just one human

74
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:14,743
Green Lantern, I would definitely pick Jon Stewart.
I would agree. I think... between the recent

75
00:07:14,783 --> 00:07:19,786
Green Lantern vs. Quasar episode we did and
the Green Lantern Beware My Power animated

76
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:25,090
feature film. I think Jon Stewart has quickly
become my favorite Green Lantern as well. Fantastic

77
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:31,434
answer, Miggy. Our final honorable mention goes
to Cyrus Moore, who said, Hey guys, Cyrus Moore

78
00:07:31,454 --> 00:07:36,157
here. Although my favorite Green Lantern is
Kyle Rayner, I feel like he's gonna be a popular

79
00:07:36,337 --> 00:07:42,361
answer. So therefore I'd like to go with Reloc
Hag, who is just a really cool Lantern to start

80
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:48,902
with. He's an alpha lantern. He has a really
interesting backstory. He's a centaur. I mean,

81
00:07:48,922 --> 00:07:54,427
you can't get any better than that. Okay, I'm
not gonna lie. I had to Google this guy. I

82
00:07:54,467 --> 00:07:59,591
know nothing about him other than he looks like
a total badass. Seriously, he has one of the

83
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:03,975
coolest designs out of any Green Lantern ever.
Like I know the Green Lanterns span all the

84
00:08:03,995 --> 00:08:09,079
races in the galaxy and the universe, but this
particular centaur race is just a really cool

85
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:16,024
design. Reloc Hag, it's spelled R-E-L-O-K. H-A-G.
If you don't know him, look him up. I think

86
00:08:16,044 --> 00:08:20,247
you'll be similarly impressed. And the fact
that he's an alpha lantern, like that just

87
00:08:20,407 --> 00:08:25,551
gives him some extra cred in my book because
those guys are awesome. The hell is an alpha

88
00:08:25,591 --> 00:08:30,715
lantern? They're kind of described as the internal
affairs of the green lanterns, but they're

89
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:36,087
essentially elite lanterns. Interesting. Now,
Cyrus also mentioned Kyle Rayner, who was your

90
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:40,910
initial favorite Green Lantern, Jonathan? Yes,
yeah, he was the Green Lantern that I personally

91
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:46,173
grew up with in the comics when I began reading
DC Comics. He was, in fact, the only Green

92
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:51,596
Lantern that existed at that time. So he was
my favorite by default. So, great answer, Cyrus.

93
00:08:52,116 --> 00:08:57,639
But the winner of this week's No Prize is...
Peter Trull, who said... What's up, Dynamic

94
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:03,915
Dudes, it's Peter. Uh, my favorite Green Lantern
has got to be... Hal Jordan easily. He's the

95
00:09:03,995 --> 00:09:08,679
one I grew up on the most and he's literally
one of the greatest lanterns of all time. He's

96
00:09:08,719 --> 00:09:13,403
mentioned in different comics, several of them,
that he is the greatest lantern. Not even greatest

97
00:09:13,443 --> 00:09:18,968
green lantern, but other lanterns of all the
lantern core. Like he is the best. So what

98
00:09:19,028 --> 00:09:23,411
else would you think other than Hal Jordan as
the best green lantern of all time? Thanks

99
00:09:23,451 --> 00:09:28,476
guys. So the only reason we didn't give the
no prize to Miggie for his answer of Jon Stewart

100
00:09:28,876 --> 00:09:35,673
is because one, I think We have in fact asked
this question before, and two, because Hal

101
00:09:35,713 --> 00:09:41,398
Jordan is the iconic Green Lantern. As much
as I like Jon Stewart, I have to admit that

102
00:09:41,418 --> 00:09:46,622
when it comes to other forms of media and just,
you know, the public perception of the character

103
00:09:46,842 --> 00:09:51,726
with the movie and everything, yeah, everyone
knows Hal Jordan as the quintessential Green

104
00:09:51,766 --> 00:09:57,666
Lantern. The dude can wield basically any ring
and is just a master of it. I remember you

105
00:09:57,706 --> 00:10:02,750
had a graphic novel called Green Lantern Fear
itself, in which there was a segment at the

106
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:08,093
end where Kyle Rayner and Alan Scott were discussing
the greatest Green Lantern of all time, and

107
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:12,557
they were talking about how Hal Jordan was the
best of them. He was, you know, the specter

108
00:10:12,597 --> 00:10:16,419
at the time, he was dead. But I always think
back to that when I think about the greatest

109
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:21,383
Green Lanterns and how if you were to ask the
core themselves who the best among them is,

110
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:25,674
a lot of them would actually pick Hal Jordan.
Yeah, maybe. Or they'd be like... Oh, that

111
00:10:25,714 --> 00:10:31,479
guy who killed all of us? Fuck that guy. He
redeemed himself. He's all good. He's good.

112
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:36,363
He was possessed. What are you gonna do? That's
true. But great answer, Peter. You win this

113
00:10:36,383 --> 00:10:40,507
week's note prize. If you're the listener, want
a shot at winning your own note prize. Stay

114
00:10:40,527 --> 00:10:44,771
tuned to later on in this episode when we'll
be asking another question of the week. And

115
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:47,213
now that that's done, on to the news.

116
00:10:52,814 --> 00:10:58,279
This past week we got the first official trailer
for the Venom The Last Dance movie which is

117
00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:02,603
coming out in October. And right off the bat
I just want to talk about my kind of love-hate

118
00:11:02,623 --> 00:11:06,827
relationship with the Venom franchise because
I actually really liked the first Venom movie.

119
00:11:06,947 --> 00:11:10,890
As you will learn if you listen to our review
I think we gave it about three and a half stars

120
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:16,436
and then I really disliked the Venom sequel
Let There Be Carnage which I think we gave

121
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:21,771
about two or two and a half stars in our review.
This third movie is really just a big question

122
00:11:21,811 --> 00:11:26,275
mark as to whether or not it'll be closer to
the first film and what made that so enjoyable

123
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:32,059
or closer to the second film which was kind
of a dumpster fire. And honestly, I couldn't

124
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,143
really tell you judging off of this trailer.
It kind of looks like it's a mix of both. There

125
00:11:36,483 --> 00:11:41,847
are some great moments where we see Venom take
on a group of criminals running a dog fighting

126
00:11:41,907 --> 00:11:45,902
ring it looks like. The intro to this trailer
was really fantastic. But then there were like

127
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:49,986
these jokes that were sprinkled through that
it made me think of the second movie. And one

128
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:55,591
of the biggest criticisms we had of Venom let
there be carnage is that Venom became a parody

129
00:11:55,651 --> 00:12:02,377
of himself. You know, it's always kind of cute
and fun to make Venom a quirky character. But

130
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:06,580
these filmmakers have to understand that they
have to do it within reason. You know, if Venom

131
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,700
starts making too many jokes. then he doesn't
really feel like who he is from the comics.

132
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,342
You know, the jokes have to be used sparingly
and that's how you get the most out of them.

133
00:12:15,762 --> 00:12:21,967
Yeah, I've never really saw Venom as a comedic
character. So I was actually taken aback by

134
00:12:22,007 --> 00:12:28,391
the first movie and pretty much despised the
second. There are jokes sprinkled in this trailer,

135
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:34,035
but by this time I'm familiar enough with what
they're going with to not entirely hate it.

136
00:12:34,155 --> 00:12:38,698
Honestly, the first time I saw this trailer,
I couldn't tell if it was gonna be like over

137
00:12:38,738 --> 00:12:46,303
the top ambitious or actually more low key.
It looks like the primary antagonists of this

138
00:12:46,363 --> 00:12:52,648
movie are going to be General Orwell Taylor.
It looks like played by Chiwetel Ejiofor who

139
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:58,532
is in charge of like this elite military symbiote
hunting squad called the jury. In the comic

140
00:12:58,572 --> 00:13:03,055
books, the jury were like a bunch of Iron Man
knockoffs. Like they literally stole blueprints

141
00:13:03,075 --> 00:13:07,538
to the Iron Man suit and then made their own
venom fighting suits of armor. But here they

142
00:13:07,558 --> 00:13:11,679
look a little bit more generic. I'm not sure
if that's them being carried on that helicopter

143
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,741
and then being dropped into the water to fight
Venom, but it really looks like that's who

144
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:21,323
they are. In addition to the jury and General
Taylor, it looks like we're also getting other

145
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:27,586
symbiotes and the xenophage who are alien monsters
that actually feed off of symbiotes. We see

146
00:13:27,686 --> 00:13:33,308
one attack Venom on top of an airplane, which
was a pretty crazy looking scene. So it's interesting

147
00:13:33,348 --> 00:13:38,771
that Venom is kind of facing threats from both
sides. The humans coming after him in the form

148
00:13:38,811 --> 00:13:42,793
of General Taylor and the jury and the clintar
coming after him in the form of other symbiotes

149
00:13:42,813 --> 00:13:47,476
in the xenophage. So Eddie Brock looks like
he's being put through the wringer even more

150
00:13:47,516 --> 00:13:52,098
so than he usually is in these films and you
know, he goes through a lot physically throughout

151
00:13:52,118 --> 00:13:55,701
the course of this franchise. And Tom Hardy
I think does a fantastic job of portraying

152
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:59,783
the wear and tear that the symbiote takes on
his body and the duelity of the character and

153
00:13:59,823 --> 00:14:03,605
everything. And that's definitely one of the
things I'm looking forward to the most and

154
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:07,503
seeing. in this upcoming movie because these
characters have been through a lot together.

155
00:14:07,903 --> 00:14:11,724
Yeah, Eddie Brock and the symbiote, there's
a bromance there. It's almost like a buddy

156
00:14:11,765 --> 00:14:15,606
comedy in a way that the way they play off each
other. And there were definitely some like

157
00:14:15,726 --> 00:14:20,588
iconic scenes in this trailer that kind of played
up on that with like Eddie Brock trying to

158
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:24,910
master the we are venom line with venom. That
was weird because they did it correctly in

159
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:29,512
the first movie. So you think they would, you
know, have it down already. That's true. But

160
00:14:29,552 --> 00:14:36,490
also, I'm thinking of Eddie Brock riding the
venom symbiote horse. That was pretty cool.

161
00:14:36,691 --> 00:14:42,474
I remember there was a moment in the Venom comics
when Flash Thompson was Agent Venom. He had

162
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:46,536
acquired the symbiote at the time and he had
used the symbiote in a bunch of weird ways,

163
00:14:46,776 --> 00:14:51,759
including some ways that I hate. Like he turned
a car that he was driving into the Venomobile

164
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:56,341
by having the symbiote take over the car, which
I thought was kind of bullshit because a car

165
00:14:56,401 --> 00:15:02,405
is not an organic being. The way they had the
symbiote take over a horse makes so much more

166
00:15:02,445 --> 00:15:07,663
sense to me and I think just works. really well.
I can't wait to see the venom horse in the

167
00:15:07,683 --> 00:15:13,725
movie. How do you feel about General Taylor
apparently being a variant of Baron Mordo?

168
00:15:14,865 --> 00:15:18,786
Because of the casting? Yeah. That's a little
weird right? You know if we're talking about

169
00:15:18,826 --> 00:15:23,888
the multiverse, there's a very strange shot
in this trailer that I know a lot of people

170
00:15:23,908 --> 00:15:29,329
are talking about where we see General Taylor
acquire the sample from the bar in Mexico that

171
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:35,494
Eddie Brock left behind in the end credits scene
for Spider-Man No Way Home. Apparently that

172
00:15:35,534 --> 00:15:40,577
piece of symbiote was left behind in the Marvel
Cinematic Universe apart from the Sonyverse

173
00:15:41,118 --> 00:15:46,682
and yet we see General Taylor somehow acquiring
that sample. It's really unclear what's going

174
00:15:46,742 --> 00:15:51,125
on here, whether or not Eddie Brock leaving
the sample behind in the MCU is going to be

175
00:15:51,225 --> 00:15:55,628
retconned to have been actually left behind
in the Sonyverse or what the hell is going

176
00:15:55,689 --> 00:16:01,962
on? Who the hell knows? Yeah, Marvel and Sony's
relationship right now is like really weird.

177
00:16:02,102 --> 00:16:08,447
It's like, are they together? Aren't they? It's
a situationship, as the kids are saying these

178
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:13,112
days, and that extends into, you know, the upcoming
Spider-Man four and everything like that. But

179
00:16:13,632 --> 00:16:18,977
I'm really interested in seeing how this movie
even pertains to the multiverse or if it even

180
00:16:19,057 --> 00:16:25,018
does. And if so, how Tom Holland is going to
get the symbiote, if he will. If that's going

181
00:16:25,038 --> 00:16:29,580
to happen in Secret War, that would be really
cool. But yeah, we'll see what happens. It

182
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:34,663
was really cool to see Detective Mulligan back
as Toxin, although we didn't get to see him

183
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:40,507
in his Toxin form in this trailer. But we know
that he acquired the symbiote, which was an

184
00:16:40,687 --> 00:16:45,730
offshoot of the Carnage symbiote in the last
movie. It'll be interesting to see how he factors

185
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:49,732
into the story, whether or not, you know, like
he's the one that's reaching out to the Klintar

186
00:16:49,752 --> 00:16:53,790
home planet and bringing all these aliens or
not. but he does say that as long as Venom

187
00:16:53,870 --> 00:17:00,252
lives, everyone, everything will end. So the
trailer really tries to sell us on the idea

188
00:17:00,272 --> 00:17:05,233
that Venom or Eddie Brock may be dying in this
movie. I'm not really buying it. You know,

189
00:17:05,293 --> 00:17:09,835
even the poster says, till death do they part.
I don't think either Eddie Brock or Venom are

190
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:14,736
actually dying, but it is a great way to try
to, you know, convince people to come see it

191
00:17:14,756 --> 00:17:18,497
in the theaters, considering that most likely,
you know, this will be the last Venom movie.

192
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:22,852
I'm really hoping though that he still shows
up maybe in a Spider-Man movie, but we'll see.

193
00:17:23,332 --> 00:17:29,297
Yeah, anytime studios say that something is
the and now, I'm like, but is it? I mean, Hugh

194
00:17:29,337 --> 00:17:34,220
Jackman's coming back as Wolverine. Right. Yeah,
that can happen. Anything can happen. But again,

195
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,343
the movie comes out on October 25th of this
year. We'll see if it's more of the first Venom

196
00:17:39,383 --> 00:17:45,347
movie or more like the second Venom movie as
it closes out this trilogy of films. But speaking

197
00:17:45,387 --> 00:17:47,869
of trilogies, that brings us to our question
of the week.

198
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:58,867
What Marvel or DC character do you think has
had the most successful trilogy of films and

199
00:17:58,947 --> 00:18:04,889
why? And we'll go ahead and count characters
that have had four films, such as Thor or Superman,

200
00:18:04,989 --> 00:18:09,410
you know, just count like the first three films
of their franchise, and we want to know which

201
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,711
one you thought was the best. And that includes

That does it for all the news for this episode,
now let's go ahead and move on to the main

208
00:18:47,788 --> 00:18:54,301
event where we review the 1993 animated film,
Batman Mask of the Phantasm.

209
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:15,813
Alright, Batman Mask of the Phantasm was a 1993
animated film that, unlike a vast majority

210
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:21,937
of DC's animated projects, had a theatrical
release. It was a feature film tie-in to the

211
00:19:21,977 --> 00:19:27,240
popular 90s animated television series, and
though I didn't see this movie in theaters

212
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,903
when it came out, I became aware of the critical
hype surrounding this film as I got older and

213
00:19:32,943 --> 00:19:37,851
still saw the movie when I was relatively young.
This was after I read Frank Miller's Batman

214
00:19:37,871 --> 00:19:44,476
Year One comic arc, however, which came out
in 1987. When the movie came out in 1993, Mask

215
00:19:44,496 --> 00:19:50,841
of the Phantasm was the closest thing non-comic
readers had to an origin of sorts for how Bruce

216
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:56,686
Wayne became Batman until Batman Begins. In
my opinion though, and this is the same opinion

217
00:19:56,806 --> 00:20:03,151
I had when I first saw the movie, Phantasm is
kinda over-hyped and comparatively not as good

218
00:20:03,392 --> 00:20:10,372
as Batman Year One, Batman Begins, and other
tales of Batman's origin. It's also not terrible,

219
00:20:10,432 --> 00:20:15,255
however. It's not bad. It's actually pretty
good. I want to be clear. I'd still recommend

220
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:19,677
it to people, so if you haven't seen it yet,
you should consider checking it out before

221
00:20:19,717 --> 00:20:25,360
we get into spoilers in this review. Yeah, I
mean, if you're a 90s kid, you most certainly

222
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,223
have already seen this film because it was pretty
ubiquitous along with the television show back

223
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:34,625
when we were children. I think we first saw
this movie at home back in the glory days of

224
00:20:34,665 --> 00:20:40,095
VHS. Yes, yeah, I think that's correct. Just
for some quick backstory regarding the film,

225
00:20:40,556 --> 00:20:45,518
Mask of the Phantasm was made because Warner
Brothers sought to capitalize on the success

226
00:20:45,598 --> 00:20:52,000
Fox was having with the WB Batman character
in Batman the Animated Series, which Warner

227
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:56,943
Brothers let Fox use for that series and which
debuted on television a year prior to this

228
00:20:56,983 --> 00:21:03,005
film's release. The film was originally intended
to be released directly to video, though halfway

229
00:21:03,025 --> 00:21:08,520
through production, Warner Bros. decided to
release the film in theaters, forcing the animators

230
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:14,524
to meet a highly aggressive production schedule.
And for as much praise as I've seen critics

231
00:21:14,544 --> 00:21:20,227
give this film in regards to its stylish animation,
I feel like they just hadn't seen much animation

232
00:21:20,307 --> 00:21:25,610
back then in general. Because by this point,
we'd already had groundbreaking animated films

233
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:32,278
like Akira and Mask of the Phantasm seems super
basic in comparison. Well... Yeah, there was

234
00:21:32,318 --> 00:21:38,923
a lot of 80s anime stuff that was truly groundbreaking
in how they approached more mature subject

235
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:44,227
matter in the medium of animated film. This
movie was animated exactly like how the Saturday

236
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:47,970
Morning Cartoon was, maybe with a little bit
more detail and frames and everything like

237
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:54,515
that. But I think if you had never been exposed
to that sort of 1940s minimalistic style, you

238
00:21:54,535 --> 00:21:59,499
would still be impressed by it. Yeah, I've seen
a few critics. praise its Art Deco style, but

239
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:03,182
I'm like, well, have you not been watching the
cartoon? Because it's there as well. It's awesome.

240
00:22:03,242 --> 00:22:09,148
I agree. Bruce Tim's style will always be iconic
to me. The Art Deco style is one of my favorite

241
00:22:09,168 --> 00:22:14,132
styles by far. And while I'm glad that we've
kind of moved past it, I understand why it

242
00:22:14,192 --> 00:22:19,517
became so influential to a lot of DC animated
work in the following decades. Yeah, that sort

243
00:22:19,557 --> 00:22:25,410
of retrofuturism is a pretty awesome style that
I think suits DC really well. Now from start

244
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:31,631
to finish, the entire film was completed in
only eight months, which is insane. It's actually

245
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:38,493
pretty interesting. Half the movie was animated
in a 4-3 aspect ratio intended for squarish

246
00:22:38,553 --> 00:22:43,675
television screens from that time. So to meet
the animation deadline, the production studios

247
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:50,176
had to simply crop their work into a wider 16
by 9 ratio for theater screens. So there's

248
00:22:50,196 --> 00:22:54,942
a lot that was animated that was left on the
cutting room floor of sorts. but that full

249
00:22:54,982 --> 00:23:00,126
version is a special feature on the digital
and disc versions of the movie. I like watching

250
00:23:00,166 --> 00:23:05,371
it in the 4-3 ratio largely because I don't
think the scale of the film really suits a

251
00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:10,295
theatrical format. To me, this movie always
played like an extended two or three part television

252
00:23:10,335 --> 00:23:16,140
series episode. Yes, I agree. I definitely agree.
There was just a kind of a lack of spectacle.

253
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,384
As good as the story is, I just don't think
it holds a candle to some of the spectacles

254
00:23:20,544 --> 00:23:25,628
that we get from animated films. But certainly
today, but you know, even in the early 2000s

255
00:23:26,148 --> 00:23:31,311
and stuff. Yeah, it's lacking spectacle. It's
lacking a number of things. I've always felt

256
00:23:31,512 --> 00:23:36,975
like the Batman mask of the fantasy movie was
missing something. And in doing my research

257
00:23:37,035 --> 00:23:43,600
for this review, I realized what that was. Arguably,
you could say fantasy was a work of corporate

258
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:49,295
passion rather than artistic passion. Bruce
Timm created Batman the animated series to

259
00:23:49,335 --> 00:23:55,118
tell Batman's iconic comic stories in a similar
fashion as the Max Fleischer Superman cartoons

260
00:23:55,139 --> 00:24:00,382
that he grew up with. But Phantasm was something
of a cash grab by Warner Brothers in the same

261
00:24:00,402 --> 00:24:06,745
way the Hobbit films or the Matrix Resurrections
or the Fantastic Beasts films were. Those films

262
00:24:06,785 --> 00:24:11,968
just lacked the same creative spirit and life
that the filmmakers breathed into the films

263
00:24:12,008 --> 00:24:17,564
that inspired those other works. I think that's
especially evident in Mask of the Phantasm

264
00:24:17,644 --> 00:24:22,069
because none of the story elements ended up
being carried over to the animated series itself.

265
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:27,414
Because there are a lot of unanswered questions
by the end of the film that good writers, if

266
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:32,619
they cared enough, would have answered, such
as, you know, where did Andrea Beaumont get

267
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:38,264
her powers? Or why did Bruce specifically choose
the symbol of the bat? Or even what happened

268
00:24:38,304 --> 00:24:42,190
to Joker at the end of the film? Yeah, there
were a lot of, I guess, plot holes, you could

269
00:24:42,210 --> 00:24:46,011
call them, although they didn't like hamper
the story. I guess they're more unanswered

270
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:50,932
questions that were left unresolved. So a lack
of closure. I also wondered things like why

271
00:24:50,973 --> 00:24:56,834
did Andrea even court Councilman Reeves and
why didn't she kill him? Basically, considering

272
00:24:56,854 --> 00:25:02,296
that he gave up her father. I think it was her
plan to kill him if the Joker hadn't already

273
00:25:02,336 --> 00:25:06,497
gotten to him. That's just speculation, though.
That's a good question. Maybe she knew the

274
00:25:06,537 --> 00:25:11,827
Joker would go after him. Who knows? Right.
Now. If the film doesn't succeed in my opinion

275
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:18,432
in regards to story or animation, one of several
things it does succeed in is the theme, particularly

276
00:25:18,873 --> 00:25:24,357
vengeance and duty. For both Batman and the
Phantasm, the film presents these parallel

277
00:25:24,517 --> 00:25:29,681
arcs, these internal struggles for both of the
titular characters that highlight the conflict

278
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:36,350
between personal fulfillment and societal obligation
in their individuel pursuits of justice. most

279
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:42,793
interesting thing about this film to me are
the questions it posits about Batman's nature.

280
00:25:42,813 --> 00:25:47,295
Now the filmmakers initially denied it, but
much of the story from this film was borrowed

281
00:25:47,435 --> 00:25:53,317
from the comic book storyline Batman Year 2,
in which Batman fought a skull mask wearing,

282
00:25:53,698 --> 00:25:58,940
scythes for hands vigilante that turned out
to be the father of a woman Bruce Wayne proposed

283
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:04,447
to. Spoilers, if you haven't read that, sorry.
But it was so obvious that that's where they

284
00:26:04,487 --> 00:26:09,450
got a lot of the story from that the writer
of Batman year two Mark Barr Approached to

285
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:14,894
DC Comics president Paul Levitz about it and
Levitz actually agreed to give Barr a portion

286
00:26:14,914 --> 00:26:19,697
of the film's earnings as well As financial
credit for the creation of the Phantasm character,

287
00:26:19,717 --> 00:26:24,260
which is pretty cool Now the Phantasm never
appeared in the mainstream comics until recently

288
00:26:24,401 --> 00:26:29,924
introduced in a run by Tom King Who has also
largely run with the same themes presented

289
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:36,011
in Mask of the Phantasm such as whether or not
Batman can ever find love, get married, be

290
00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:41,832
happy, and still be Batman. But let's touch
more on Batman and the themes in the character

291
00:26:41,873 --> 00:26:48,054
breakdown. Now Batman slash Bruce Wayne was
voiced by Kevin Conroy, who, as we've stated

292
00:26:48,134 --> 00:26:53,616
numerous times on this podcast, is perfect as
Batman. And this film showcases one of the

293
00:26:53,676 --> 00:26:59,722
best examples of the heart and emotion he was
capable of bringing to the role. Yeah, I don't

294
00:26:59,762 --> 00:27:03,786
think we've ever seen Batman as emotional as
he was in this story. You know, usually he's

295
00:27:03,866 --> 00:27:08,390
kind of a stoic badass, but in this, you know,
we actually see him cry, you know, and he's

296
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:12,833
like weeping and like pleading with his dead
parents and everything like that. So, this

297
00:27:12,874 --> 00:27:17,878
movie is just a testament to Kevin Conroy. This
was actually early in his Batman career and

298
00:27:17,918 --> 00:27:22,041
he went on to, you know, really define the character
I think for a lot of people. Rest in peace.

299
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:27,814
Yes, RIP Kevin Conroy. Now in the film, Bruce
grapples with his identity as Batman and his

300
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:34,701
desire for a normal life with his former fiancee,
Andrea Beaumont. When Bruce's past with Andrea

301
00:27:34,761 --> 00:27:41,267
resurfaces, he's forced to confront these unresolved
emotions regarding his own personal desires

302
00:27:41,307 --> 00:27:47,493
and how they conflict with his sense of duty
as Gotham's protector. Ultimately, Bruce accepts,

303
00:27:47,653 --> 00:27:54,214
albeit- reluctantly perhaps that the sacrifices
inherent to his role as Batman, this duty to

304
00:27:54,234 --> 00:28:01,439
Gotham City and vengeful crusade, transcends
his own happiness. And the arc of him realizing

305
00:28:01,499 --> 00:28:06,743
that was a pretty profound one I would say in
this movie, and again a very emotional one.

306
00:28:07,084 --> 00:28:12,679
The line of him at his parents grave where he's
saying I never expected to be happy or something

307
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:18,163
along those lines was unbelievable. And still
watching the film to this day kind of gets

308
00:28:18,203 --> 00:28:24,847
me the fact that this guy would sacrifice his
life essentially to protecting others is like

309
00:28:24,887 --> 00:28:30,151
the definition of heroism. It was really tragic
that moment when he was basically, you know,

310
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:36,454
begging his parents to break his promise to
them. and step away from the role of Batman

311
00:28:36,734 --> 00:28:41,916
and be happy with a wife and family and everything
like that. It was particularly tragic because

312
00:28:42,436 --> 00:28:48,058
you can assume, especially as a parent, that
Batman is not what the Waynes would want for

313
00:28:48,098 --> 00:28:52,819
their son Bruce. You know, they would actually
want him to be happy and to move on from the

314
00:28:52,859 --> 00:28:58,060
tragedy of their deaths and not be so affected
by it. And so, when he's essentially pleading

315
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,082
with them to like let him do that, you have
to imagine the Waynes. being like, of course,

316
00:29:03,182 --> 00:29:08,923
but he won't let himself break his own promise
that he made. Right, because he's so unbelievably

317
00:29:09,003 --> 00:29:15,345
dedicated to that vow and to his cause. It's
a very, very interesting character study. And

318
00:29:15,405 --> 00:29:20,086
I think that, you know, goes to show why the
character is so popular. That sort of exploration

319
00:29:20,267 --> 00:29:25,448
isn't something that has been explored much
for the character that I think warrants further

320
00:29:25,508 --> 00:29:30,269
exploration, for sure. I think they attempted
it in the Nolan films, especially The Dark

321
00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:35,822
Knight Rises. but not to the same level of success
I would argue as Batman Mask of the Phantasm.

322
00:29:36,162 --> 00:29:43,029
This idea that Batman has an ending is not terribly
attractive. I want Batman to continue his crusade

323
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:48,695
forever because I think that's heroic and I
think giving that up is not heroic. And maybe

324
00:29:48,735 --> 00:29:54,361
that's selfish of me, but it's just this ideal
that Batman represents that is attractive in

325
00:29:54,381 --> 00:29:59,020
a way. Well, you've always said that you like
your DC characters because they're aspirational

326
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:04,604
and more symbols than they are characters. And
I think Batman giving up his crusade to actually

327
00:30:04,724 --> 00:30:10,088
be happy would make him more relatable and therefore
more of a Marvel character. So I think maybe

328
00:30:10,128 --> 00:30:14,471
that's your own bias. Maybe. I mean, do you
want to see Batman give up his crusade? I don't

329
00:30:14,491 --> 00:30:24,194
give a fuck about Batman. Geez! Whatever. Moving
on to Andrea Beaumont, aka the Phantasm. She

330
00:30:24,214 --> 00:30:30,959
was voiced by Dana Delaney. Now this was several
years prior to her voicing Lois Lane in Superman

331
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:36,543
the Animated Series. So I'm sure there was not
a problem with her voice when this hit theaters,

332
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:42,087
but holy crap, all I could hear was Lois Lane
watching this now. And she did a great job

333
00:30:42,127 --> 00:30:47,731
in the role, don't get me wrong, but her voice
is extremely recognizable and it did present

334
00:30:47,771 --> 00:30:52,550
a challenge for me in watching this film once
again. Character wise, they were both, you

335
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:57,651
know, these spunky romantic interests. And yeah,
I just, I just kind of shake it. It's like,

336
00:30:57,671 --> 00:31:02,433
oh, it's, it's Lois Lane. My brain was just
thinking that the whole time. That too time

337
00:31:02,453 --> 00:31:09,355
in... Now we know where she went off to in the
boat. She went to go get a die job and moved

338
00:31:09,395 --> 00:31:15,056
to Metropolis. Change her name. Boom. Now, though
we don't know it for most of the film, Andrea's

339
00:31:15,176 --> 00:31:20,526
arc revolves around themes of loss and vengeance,
much like Batman's. She's driven by this desire

340
00:31:20,566 --> 00:31:25,750
for retribution against the mobsters responsible
for her father's death and adopts the persona

341
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:33,534
of the Phantasm to exact justice. But in contrast
to Batman, Andrea lacks his morality and is

342
00:31:33,554 --> 00:31:38,918
willing to kill and lie to loved ones including
Bruce himself, manipulating him to prevent

343
00:31:38,958 --> 00:31:44,341
him from stopping her mission. The thing is,
despite this, Andrea is still a sympathetic

344
00:31:44,381 --> 00:31:50,034
character. because it clearly shows in the movie
how the mob took literally everything from

345
00:31:50,094 --> 00:31:56,219
her, including the life of her father. Alfred
describes vengeance in the movie as a soul-destroying

346
00:31:56,259 --> 00:32:02,505
abyss that Bruce skirts the edge of every day
and that Andrea fell into long ago. I think

347
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:06,868
she recognized this as well, which is why she
chose not to be with Bruce at the end of the

348
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:11,532
film. She's a study on what would happen, I
think, if Batman started killing people like

349
00:32:11,552 --> 00:32:17,215
the Joker. Right. he would kind of lose himself
and become a serial killer, really. How could

350
00:32:17,255 --> 00:32:22,616
he not? Like, he's so effective at what he does,
it would be so easy for him to do that. And

351
00:32:22,716 --> 00:32:28,438
once he did it once, you'd figure he'd be like,
oh, it's very easy to do this. It's just, yeah,

352
00:32:28,458 --> 00:32:33,159
a bad path to go down. That being said, I still
think he should do it. But we've had this discussion

353
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:37,160
a million times before. If you want to hear
more about this discussion, listen to our review

354
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:42,430
of Batman Under the Red Hood because they really
get into it deep in that story. Yes, absolutely.

355
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:47,451
Also, you're fucking evil, bro. I think it's
evil to not kill him. Well, you're wrong. Anyway,

356
00:32:48,692 --> 00:32:53,613
now one of my biggest problems with this film
is something I noticed even as a child watching

357
00:32:53,633 --> 00:32:59,635
this for the first time. And that's how the
hell did Andrea get her powers. Like intangibility

358
00:32:59,675 --> 00:33:04,877
and teleportation are pretty impressive feats.
You'd think Batman's first question upon learning

359
00:33:04,897 --> 00:33:10,863
she was the Phantasm would have been, dude.
Teach me. I mean, we all know that Batman seemingly

360
00:33:10,923 --> 00:33:15,165
teleports when like people have their backs
turned. We know he just kind of like scampers

361
00:33:15,265 --> 00:33:19,526
off and hides. So people think that he just
vanishes out of thin air, but we literally

362
00:33:19,627 --> 00:33:25,329
see the phantasm character disappear completely
in a puff of smoke. There's no other way around

363
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:30,271
it except teleportation. So she's doing something
we're here. Maybe she got into like the occult

364
00:33:30,311 --> 00:33:34,533
or something. That's the idea that I have in
the back of my head. Oh, interesting. I always

365
00:33:34,693 --> 00:33:41,096
assumed it was technology. Why did I never assume
it was magic? That's a good answer. And it's

366
00:33:41,136 --> 00:33:46,239
my new headcanon, so thanks for that. There
you go. But another thing that really bothers

367
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:53,323
me about this film is the twist is so obvious.
And this has bothered me about other Batman

368
00:33:53,363 --> 00:34:00,987
stories such as like Hush, where the newly introduced
friend of Bruce Wayne is also the newly introduced

369
00:34:01,127 --> 00:34:07,831
villain. Even as a kid, I was like, I bet you
that's Andrea. And I was fucking right. I was

370
00:34:07,891 --> 00:34:13,815
a smart kid. Moving on to the Joker, voiced
by Mark Hamill. Again, we've said so many great

371
00:34:13,835 --> 00:34:19,119
things about Mark Hamill's performance as the
Joker. Like Kevin Conroy for Batman, he is

372
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:25,043
the quintessential Joker voice. Yeah, I think
we spoke a lot about him in the Killing Joke

373
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:30,558
animated movie review that we did. This performance
is also... pretty early in Mark Hamill's career

374
00:34:30,618 --> 00:34:36,201
as the Joker. And it's just amazing to see how
consistent these guys were throughout the decades.

375
00:34:36,801 --> 00:34:42,724
Oh yeah, for sure. So the first time we see
the Joker, we don't know it. He's an anonymous

376
00:34:42,844 --> 00:34:48,346
mob lackey of Salvatore Valestra. There's been
a number of ways that writers have tried to

377
00:34:48,426 --> 00:34:53,148
tie the Joker into Batman's origin throughout
the years, you know, for making him the one

378
00:34:53,168 --> 00:34:59,912
who murdered the Waynes in the 1989 Batman film.
or causing a citywide riot that resulted in

379
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:05,616
the Wayne's death in the Joker movie. In this
film, he wasn't involved in the deaths of the

380
00:35:05,656 --> 00:35:11,240
Waynes that we know of, but he represented a
threat to the object of Bruce's desire and

381
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:17,064
happiness, namely, Andrea, which if Bruce had
been allowed to keep, he would not have become

382
00:35:17,124 --> 00:35:22,949
Batman. And honestly, that's as direct an influence
to Batman's origin as I'd personally care for

383
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:27,515
the Joker to have. Yeah, I remember that the
Joker was in this movie from watching it as

384
00:35:27,555 --> 00:35:33,638
a kid, but I couldn't remember in the course
of the film how and why and when he shows up.

385
00:35:33,718 --> 00:35:37,900
Now he doesn't actually show up until like a
little bit past halfway through the runtime,

386
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,122
if I'm not mistaken. And I thought his presence
was actually sorely missed because once he

387
00:35:42,162 --> 00:35:46,604
shows up, I think the film starts firing on
all cylinders, but before that the pacing was

388
00:35:46,624 --> 00:35:50,862
a little bit slow. I was really glad to have
Joker in this movie. Yeah, originally he wasn't

389
00:35:50,902 --> 00:35:55,845
going to be in the movie, but they found a way
to organically bring him in. And I gotta say,

390
00:35:56,045 --> 00:36:00,608
I love it. Now, as we've mentioned before, people
have always wondered why Batman doesn't kill

391
00:36:00,648 --> 00:36:05,991
the Joker, and interestingly enough, in this
film, Joker actually seems somewhat threatened

392
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:11,014
by the Phantasm when he confronts Councilman
Reeves because he knows he was one of the mobsters

393
00:36:11,034 --> 00:36:15,736
that the Phantasm might be after. I feel like
this is the first time I've seen the Joker

394
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:20,792
threatened by a ghost from his past. And I just
thought that was fascinating. Yeah, the Joker

395
00:36:20,832 --> 00:36:24,795
never really fears any of the consequences to
his actions because he knows that Batman will

396
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:30,180
never kill him. So he kind of feels like he
has the freedom to do what he wants. And in

397
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:35,044
a way, he's kind of right. So when he is faced
with death, he of course, you know, goes above

398
00:36:35,084 --> 00:36:40,149
and beyond to eliminate that threat. Whereas
with Batman, he never truly wants to kill Batman,

399
00:36:40,429 --> 00:36:45,533
he would rather corrupt him. It is kind of cool
that he tries to do that using his secret lair.

400
00:36:45,866 --> 00:36:50,747
made out of the ruins of the Gotham World Fair.
I thought that was a nice little setting that

401
00:36:50,787 --> 00:36:56,549
they incorporated into this film. Yeah, absolutely.
It was a great place for a final climactic

402
00:36:56,589 --> 00:37:01,651
battle, the way Joker was able to utilize all
the different toys and stuff around him. I

403
00:37:01,711 --> 00:37:07,653
loved that like, knife chopping robot. I loved
like, the miniature Gotham City. It was all

404
00:37:07,673 --> 00:37:08,373
pretty great stuff.

touch on those briefly. It's a CG rendition
of the animated Gotham Cityscape, and it's

414
00:38:15,012 --> 00:38:21,455
actually pretty awesome. Of course, it's made
even better by Shirley Walker's iconic animated

415
00:38:21,495 --> 00:38:27,510
series score, which sets the perfect tone for
a Batman movie. It almost makes you wish that

416
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:32,272
they had taken bigger swings with the animation,
right? Because we have this really cool animated

417
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:37,474
setup into the film, and then all of a sudden
it goes back to standard Saturday morning cartoon

418
00:38:37,514 --> 00:38:41,536
fare. But at least if they had kept the environment
CG or something like that, I think it would

419
00:38:41,556 --> 00:38:47,659
have felt like a more true theatrical experience.
Yeah, I mean, CG was pretty new to that time.

420
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:52,280
So I think that probably would have been more
of a challenge for them. I could be wrong.

421
00:38:52,761 --> 00:38:57,039
But yeah, I think that also would have been
cool. I wonder why they didn't take that 3D

422
00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:01,281
model that they had created of Gotham City and
then incorporate it into the television series

423
00:39:01,361 --> 00:39:06,664
kind of the same way they did with the Spider-Man
animated television show in the 90s where they

424
00:39:06,684 --> 00:39:10,806
had a 3D model of New York that they would keep
revisiting as he was like swinging through

425
00:39:10,826 --> 00:39:14,768
the streets or to use as a transition between
scenes and stuff like that. I think it makes

426
00:39:14,788 --> 00:39:19,231
sense for the character of Spider-Man. You really
didn't have those transitional scenes with

427
00:39:19,451 --> 00:39:23,873
Batman in his series. I'm not sure it would
have been necessary. Although, you know, honestly...

428
00:39:24,254 --> 00:39:27,856
If they thought of that, they probably could
have found a way to make it work. I'm sure

429
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:31,378
for audience members in the theater at the time,
it was like breathtaking because you have to

430
00:39:31,398 --> 00:39:38,482
remember this was pre mainstream CG animated
films, like pre Toy Story. Right. So, yeah,

431
00:39:38,722 --> 00:39:42,704
I bet it was really cool. Now, moving on to
the plot. Well, Batman confronts a gang of

432
00:39:42,784 --> 00:39:48,827
mobsters led by Chucky Saul for counterfeiting.
Chucky flees only to be encountered and killed

433
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:55,571
by a new enigmatic vigilante known as the Phantasm.
whose silhouette resembles Batman's, resulting

434
00:39:55,611 --> 00:40:01,394
in witnesses blaming Batman for Chucky's murder.
Amidst a public censure from city councilman

435
00:40:01,474 --> 00:40:06,576
Arthur Reeves, Batman analyzes a shard of glass
with a chemical residue from the Phantasm's

436
00:40:06,636 --> 00:40:13,079
signature smokey aura, while Andrea Boumont,
Bruce's former fiancé, returns to Gotham after

437
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:19,223
years of being away. And this is sort of like
the first plot hole. The fact that Andrea was

438
00:40:19,343 --> 00:40:25,248
already in Gotham as the Phantasm, and yet we
see a scene of her arriving via plane. It's

439
00:40:25,648 --> 00:40:31,433
supposed to be this misdirect that actually
just results in confusion later on. Well, Batman

440
00:40:31,453 --> 00:40:37,818
addresses it. He's like, you came into Gotham
early. Seemingly, she came in by boat and then

441
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:43,183
she probably left by boat and then came in by
plane. But like, why would that matter to someone

442
00:40:43,223 --> 00:40:48,527
who wasn't specifically following her movements?
You know? a little bit strange. Do you think

443
00:40:48,567 --> 00:40:55,611
that Andrea specifically designed her phantasm
outfit to resemble Batman and therefore be

444
00:40:55,671 --> 00:41:02,035
confused for him by eyewitnesses? Well that's
a good question. I don't know it's possible

445
00:41:02,175 --> 00:41:08,719
although I don't really think she had a vendetta
against Batman per se so I think she was honestly

446
00:41:08,759 --> 00:41:12,766
just trying to scare people in the same way
that Batman was trying to scare people. She

447
00:41:12,806 --> 00:41:16,888
wouldn't have been familiar with Batman because
she had been away from Gotham for so long.

448
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:22,773
It just kind of turned into this kind of shitty
coincidence for Batman. Now regarding the suit,

449
00:41:23,673 --> 00:41:28,417
I didn't really touch on her appearance. I thought
the design of the Phantasm was actually pretty

450
00:41:28,457 --> 00:41:34,041
bomb. Again, it's inspired somewhat by the Grim
Reaper character from Batman Year 2, but I

451
00:41:34,081 --> 00:41:40,125
think that further went on to inspire Asriel's
look from the comics. I thought Asriel predates

452
00:41:40,165 --> 00:41:45,903
the Phantasm. He does, but I don't think that
costume does, because for the longest time,

453
00:41:46,163 --> 00:41:53,085
Asriel wore like a cybernetic Batman suit. Asriel
being the guy who took over for Batman after

454
00:41:53,145 --> 00:41:58,386
his back was broken by Bane. Yes, if you want
to learn more about him, check out our Asriel

455
00:41:58,426 --> 00:42:04,848
vs. Blade episode. During a party at Wayne Manor,
Bruce is accosted by an old romantic fling

456
00:42:04,908 --> 00:42:10,394
and reminded of Andrea by Councilman Reeve,
who unbeknownst to Bruce... has been talking

457
00:42:10,414 --> 00:42:15,897
with Andrea. Bruce reminisces in a flashback
to the time he first met Andrea in a cemetery

458
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:21,260
while visiting his parents' grave. That same
evening, Bruce begins his masked vigilante

459
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:26,683
career, stopping a group of bandits, though
facing significant resistance and getting injured

460
00:42:26,723 --> 00:42:32,326
in the process. Recognizing he needs to strike
fear in criminals to have an advantage over

461
00:42:32,366 --> 00:42:37,849
them, Bruce nonetheless becomes distracted by
Andrea when she visits him during his training.

462
00:42:38,206 --> 00:42:44,951
and the two share their first kiss. Now an interesting
note for the flashbacks in this film, they

463
00:42:44,971 --> 00:42:50,896
were inspired by Citizen Kane. I could see that
for sure. Yeah, yeah, me too. Right when I

464
00:42:51,016 --> 00:42:55,120
read that I was like, oh yeah. If you're not
familiar with Citizen Kane, it's an old film

465
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:00,744
by Orson Welles, black and white, but it's highly
regarded by a majority of film critics as the

466
00:43:00,784 --> 00:43:05,067
greatest film that's ever been made. Yeah, I
mean, I don't know how much I buy into the

467
00:43:05,147 --> 00:43:08,909
idea of it being inspired by Citizen Kane, because
then you could say like all flashbacks are

468
00:43:08,929 --> 00:43:15,172
inspired by Citizen Kane, but the kind of 1940s
Art Deco feel of Mask of the Phantasm kind

469
00:43:15,233 --> 00:43:19,855
of easily lends itself to those comparisons
to Citizen Kane. Yeah, and sort of like the

470
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:26,039
main character being this sort of tortured billionaire.
Yeah. I think if any comics character is going

471
00:43:26,059 --> 00:43:31,261
to have a film based on Citizen Kane, it's definitely
Batman. I think that was a really smart decision.

472
00:43:31,554 --> 00:43:36,798
to take inspiration for the filmmakers. Or Tony
Stark. Yeah, Tony Stark could go fuck himself.

473
00:43:37,158 --> 00:43:43,603
WHAT? I SAID IT! Anyway, back to the present,
mob boss Buzz Bronski visits the grave of Chuckie

474
00:43:43,643 --> 00:43:49,168
Saul at the cemetery, where he's confronted
and killed by the Phantasm. Batman is blamed

475
00:43:49,228 --> 00:43:54,652
by the press once again to the dismay of both
Mob Boss Salvatore Velestra and Councilman

476
00:43:54,712 --> 00:44:00,377
Reeves, the latter of whom presses Police Commissioner
James Gordon to go after Batman, though Gordon

477
00:44:00,417 --> 00:44:06,377
refuses. While Batman investigates the cemetery
for clues, he finds more chemical residue before

478
00:44:06,417 --> 00:44:12,781
finding his parents' grave, where he's caught
by Andrea, who realizes Batman must be Bruce.

479
00:44:12,921 --> 00:44:17,404
Maybe a little bit of a stretch, but yeah, he
shouldn't have been at his frickin' parents'

480
00:44:17,424 --> 00:44:22,447
grave. Rookie move. I gotta say earlier on in
the story when we see that Batman year one

481
00:44:22,487 --> 00:44:27,054
moment where Bruce Wayne is kinda trying his
hand at being a vigilante the first time. It

482
00:44:27,094 --> 00:44:32,997
was quite comical to see him attempt that outside
of the Batman costume, where he's just some

483
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:38,300
like guy who shows up and he's like, Hey guys,
stop it. And like their reaction to him was

484
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:43,843
actually kind of funny. They're like, who's
this guy? Right. Absolutely. To all the haters

485
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:49,366
who are like, Oh, Batman's so dumb. He's a guy
wearing a bat costume. Have you considered

486
00:44:49,406 --> 00:44:54,649
the alternative? I think this is a perfect example
of that. Just how ridiculous it is. You better

487
00:44:54,709 --> 00:45:01,740
listen to me or else. He's much better as this
haunting mythical creature of the night for

488
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:07,582
sure. Batman spies on Andrea as she dines with
Councilman Reeves. In a flashback, we see his

489
00:45:07,622 --> 00:45:13,825
and Andrea's romance bloom as they visit a futurism
exhibit at the Gotham World Fair. Andrea later

490
00:45:13,865 --> 00:45:19,387
introduces Bruce to her father, Carl Beaumont,
whom Bruce learns handles the finances for

491
00:45:19,447 --> 00:45:25,578
Salvatore Valestra and for whom a younger Arthur
Reeves worked for as a lawyer. As Bruce and

492
00:45:25,658 --> 00:45:31,381
Andrea leave her father's office, they encounter
a biker gang robbing a civilian on the street.

493
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:36,864
When Bruce intervenes, he becomes distracted
by Andrea and gets injured, allowing the biker

494
00:45:36,884 --> 00:45:42,427
gang to get away with the money. Realizing he
can't pursue the life of vigilantism that he

495
00:45:42,487 --> 00:45:47,570
vowed on his parents' grave and simultaneously
lead a fulfilling, happy life with Andrea,

496
00:45:47,951 --> 00:45:54,018
the tormented Bruce visits his parents' grave,
where Andrea finds and comforts him. Best scene

497
00:45:54,058 --> 00:45:58,682
of the whole movie. Yeah. Do you think that
maybe Batman would just be more effective if

498
00:45:58,762 --> 00:46:03,245
he wasn't distracted by his girlfriend while
trying to fight crime? Like maybe he could

499
00:46:03,265 --> 00:46:09,430
have it both ways and he's just kind of being
dumb? Well, that's a good question. I think

500
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:13,973
he would always kind of have her at the back
of his mind. He'd be afraid to take certain

501
00:46:14,033 --> 00:46:19,477
risks because he could get injured and, you
know, that would not be good for his loved

502
00:46:19,577 --> 00:46:24,713
ones. You could argue that, you know, he probably
runs into the same issue with his Robins. You

503
00:46:24,733 --> 00:46:30,317
know, what happens to young Dick Grayson if
his caretaker, Bruce Wayne, gets killed while

504
00:46:30,337 --> 00:46:36,021
being Batman? But for some reason, Bruce's romantic
life seems to affect him more, I guess. Well,

505
00:46:36,081 --> 00:46:40,064
with Robin, he's setting up a legacy, so he
knows that if he ever kicks the bucket, he

506
00:46:40,084 --> 00:46:45,128
has someone to take up his mantle. That's true.
Why doesn't he just train his wife or girlfriend

507
00:46:45,208 --> 00:46:51,035
to, you know, kick ass too? That's a fair point
considering, you know, Andrea actually can

508
00:46:51,195 --> 00:46:56,978
fight and be a masked vigilante as the phantasm.
I don't know, maybe if he knew that they could

509
00:46:56,998 --> 00:47:01,080
have fought crime together. Maybe they should
have ended up together in the end. When Batman

510
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:06,202
was spying on Andrea and the councilman, do
you think he was crying or do you think it

511
00:47:06,222 --> 00:47:12,065
was just raining on his face? Rain, dude. Rain.
Batman doesn't cry like that. It's always in

512
00:47:12,085 --> 00:47:17,348
the rain. You can't prove anything. Back in
the present, Salvatore confronts Arthur Reeves

513
00:47:17,408 --> 00:47:23,372
and confirms Reeves' suspicions that Batman
is killing mob bosses. Meanwhile, Batman deduces

514
00:47:23,412 --> 00:47:29,337
that Salvatore, Buzz Bronski, and Chuckie Sol
were business partners in the past. While investigating

515
00:47:29,397 --> 00:47:36,202
Sal's office, he notices a photo of Sal, Buzz,
Chuckie, and Andrea's father, Carl, all together.

516
00:47:36,642 --> 00:47:42,786
In a flashback, Bruce remembers his sunset marriage
proposal to Andrea. just as a swarm of bats

517
00:47:42,906 --> 00:47:48,390
emerged from a nearby cave on his property.
As Bruce drops Andrea off at her father's home,

518
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:53,273
they notice he has company. The following day,
after Bruce investigates the cave from where

519
00:47:53,293 --> 00:47:58,296
the bats came, Bruce receives a letter from
Andrea saying that she can't marry him, that

520
00:47:58,336 --> 00:48:03,159
she's leaving to Europe with her father, and
that he should forget about her. In his grief,

521
00:48:03,299 --> 00:48:09,359
Bruce rededicates his vow to his parents and
becomes the Batman. Another really iconic scene

522
00:48:09,479 --> 00:48:14,403
in this film is when Batman puts on the cowl
for the very first time and you just see the

523
00:48:14,483 --> 00:48:20,468
look of shock and horror on Alfred's face. That
was, I thought, really effectively done. I

524
00:48:20,508 --> 00:48:25,551
don't love the way he came to adopt the mantle
of the bat because it's not entirely clear

525
00:48:25,672 --> 00:48:31,376
why he chose the bat in this movie, but that
reveal of him as Batman without even seeing

526
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:37,300
him on screen was fantastic. You have to imagine
that Alfred seeing Batman become this monstrous

527
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:44,004
figure, a guy who, like he says in this movie,
diapered his bottom since he was a baby, is

528
00:48:44,185 --> 00:48:49,088
actually significantly terrifying. Yeah, he's
like, that's way scarier than, you know, fighting

529
00:48:49,288 --> 00:48:54,572
crime in your civilian clothes like you were
before. Right. Now back in the present, Salvatore

530
00:48:54,612 --> 00:48:59,575
visits the abandoned World Fair, the secret
hideout of the Joker, attempting to hire him

531
00:48:59,615 --> 00:49:05,958
to kill Batman, though Sal angers Joker in the
process. After Councilman Reeves returns Andrea

532
00:49:05,998 --> 00:49:11,620
home from a date, Andrea and Batman confront
each other in her room, with Batman inquiring

533
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:17,142
about her father Carl and Andrea accusing Batman
of being controlled by his parents. When the

534
00:49:17,182 --> 00:49:22,803
Phantom attempts to kill Salvatore in his home,
it finds that the Joker beat him to it, poisoning

535
00:49:22,843 --> 00:49:28,385
Salvatore with Joker venom and rigging his body
with a camera to find out who's really killing

536
00:49:28,445 --> 00:49:34,333
the mob bosses. The Phantasm manages to escape
before the Joker blows up Sel's home, only

537
00:49:34,373 --> 00:49:39,978
to then be chased down by Batman. The Phantasm
disappears, however, and Batman is forced to

538
00:49:40,018 --> 00:49:45,182
flee from the police, who believe he's responsible
for the Joker's explosion and Sel's death.

539
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:50,787
Badly injured in the police pursuit, Batman
is rescued by Andrea, who takes him back to

540
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:57,773
Wayne Manor. I wonder if Joker rigged the camera
on the body because he knew that the killer

541
00:49:57,793 --> 00:50:02,277
wasn't Batman. because he knew that Batman doesn't
kill. I think it's that exactly. Yeah, he was

542
00:50:02,297 --> 00:50:07,081
trying to find out who was really going after
the mob bosses and therefore later on, possibly

543
00:50:07,181 --> 00:50:12,927
even him. Now you brought up a point earlier
about a plot hole as to why Andrea was dating

544
00:50:13,187 --> 00:50:18,852
the councilman. And I am kind of angry now because
I didn't think about that. And I do have to

545
00:50:18,872 --> 00:50:24,497
wonder, like, if she's coming into Gotham, why
not contact Bruce, her former fiance right

546
00:50:24,517 --> 00:50:30,884
away? I wonder if she was waiting for her whole
crusade to be over with, and then maybe she,

547
00:50:30,944 --> 00:50:36,146
like Batman, considered the possibility that
they could continue their lives together? Or

548
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:40,769
what was going on there? Why did she have to
make her presence known as Andrea to begin

549
00:50:40,809 --> 00:50:45,931
with? She should have just snuck in and been
the phantasm all the time. She didn't need

550
00:50:45,971 --> 00:50:52,762
her alter ego there out in public. That's very
true. Plot hole, dammit. Now Andrea reveals

551
00:50:52,802 --> 00:50:58,066
that on the day of Bruce's marriage proposal,
the visitors at her father's house were Sal,

552
00:50:58,126 --> 00:51:03,870
Buzz, and Chucky, demanding money from her father
Carl, who had it tied up in investments. After

553
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:08,873
lying to the mobsters, saying they'll have their
money the next day, Carl explains to Andrea

554
00:51:08,893 --> 00:51:13,617
that they had to flee or face death from the
mob. Though Carl made a fortune in Europe and

555
00:51:13,657 --> 00:51:18,720
later paid back the mob their money, it wasn't
enough for them, and Bruce deduces that the

556
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:24,460
phantasm must be Carl. Bruce and Andrea rekindle
their love for one another, and the following

557
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:30,564
morning, as Bruce contemplates retiring the
cowl after settling this whole matter, he recognizes

558
00:51:30,644 --> 00:51:36,668
in the photograph of Carl, Cell, Buzz, and Chucky
that another familiar face, one of Cell's mobsters,

559
00:51:37,108 --> 00:51:43,432
is in fact the Joker. Now that was an interesting
twist, because I had forgotten that the Joker

560
00:51:43,452 --> 00:51:49,332
was the mobster that worked for Salvatore. The
camera always kept going back to the long nose

561
00:51:49,472 --> 00:51:53,935
henchmen in the flashbacks and everything like
that. But even then, I didn't put two and two

562
00:51:53,955 --> 00:51:58,258
together until this scene where he's looking
at the photo. I was like, oh, okay. Yeah, that

563
00:51:58,298 --> 00:52:04,022
is the Joker. Right. Yeah. And of course, the
Joker has a alternate history as a mobster,

564
00:52:04,202 --> 00:52:08,445
not only from the comics, but also, of course,
Tim Burton's 1989 Batman film. So I thought

565
00:52:08,465 --> 00:52:13,169
it worked really well as a quasi history of
sorts for the Joker in the Batman animated

566
00:52:13,209 --> 00:52:18,809
series universe. After Joker confronts Councilman
Reeves, suspecting he may be the Phantasm,

567
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:24,514
Reeves ends up in the hospital, unable to stop
laughing. Batman visits him and learns that

568
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:29,818
Reeves and Carl kept in touch while he was away
in Europe. When Carl refused to help Reeves

569
00:52:29,858 --> 00:52:34,903
find his election campaign, Reeves turned to
the mob and gave them Carl's location in exchange

570
00:52:34,923 --> 00:52:40,788
for money. When Batman arrives at Andrea's to
tell her the news, he answers her phone only

571
00:52:40,828 --> 00:52:46,448
to hear the Joker threaten to kill her. As Batman
manages to prevent a bomb strapped to a plane

572
00:52:46,468 --> 00:52:52,433
from the World's Fair from blowing up Andrea's
home, we see Andrea at the World's Fair where

573
00:52:52,453 --> 00:52:57,978
she remembers in a flashback when she witnessed
the pre-Joker mobster leave her father's house

574
00:52:58,018 --> 00:53:03,703
just before she found him dead. Now, the scene
of Batman interrogating Councilman Reeves in

575
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:09,167
the hospital as he's, you know, dosed up on
Joker venom and can't stop laughing was one

576
00:53:09,207 --> 00:53:12,354
of my favorite scenes in the movie. And I think
one of my favorite scenes in the movie. favorite

577
00:53:12,414 --> 00:53:17,622
Batman interrogation scenes I've ever seen.
A lot of props has to go to the animation department

578
00:53:17,722 --> 00:53:24,731
for, I think, realistically depicting this condition
that the councilman is in. It was very believable.

579
00:53:24,992 --> 00:53:30,474
The voice acting was fantastic. Just really
interesting. Felt bad for the guy. Yeah. I'm

580
00:53:30,514 --> 00:53:34,155
still surprised that he made it out alive through
the course of this movie. I guess you could

581
00:53:34,215 --> 00:53:40,396
rationalize Andrea dating Kim because maybe
she was trying to figure out on her own whether

582
00:53:40,436 --> 00:53:45,178
or not the councilman was involved in her father's
death. That's my head, Kenan now. Oh, yeah.

583
00:53:45,398 --> 00:53:49,799
Yeah. She was investigating him. And that's
also maybe why she actually came back as Andrea

584
00:53:50,039 --> 00:53:56,741
and didn't just sneak in to Gotham as the phantasm.
Plot hole filled? I'm going to say yes. We

585
00:53:56,801 --> 00:54:02,640
figured it out. There you go. Now when the Phantasm
confronts Joker at the abandoned World's Fair,

586
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:08,584
Joker reveals that he knows it's Andrea, who
reveals it is in fact her beneath the mask

587
00:54:08,604 --> 00:54:14,108
before the two fight. Using the fair's technology
to his advantage, Joker nearly succeeds in

588
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:20,392
killing Andrea before Batman arrives and rescues
her. Though Batman and Andrea argue over her

589
00:54:20,492 --> 00:54:26,176
actions, Andrea agrees to leave and Batman pursues
the Joker, who reveals that he's triggered

590
00:54:26,216 --> 00:54:30,887
explosives throughout the fairgrounds, that
will soon detonate. When the Joker is defeated,

591
00:54:31,327 --> 00:54:38,312
Andrea reappears and grabs him and the two disappear
just before the entire fair blows up. One thing

592
00:54:38,332 --> 00:54:45,896
that kind of bothered me here is once Batman
rescues Andrea, she starts using his name Bruce

593
00:54:45,956 --> 00:54:50,659
willy nilly and they're talking like they know
each other. It would be so easy for Joker to

594
00:54:50,719 --> 00:54:57,350
figure out this is Bruce Wayne. What? Like kind
of reckless. After Batman escapes the explosions,

595
00:54:57,530 --> 00:55:02,892
Alfred consoles Bruce, saying there was no way
to save Andrea, as she had already fallen too

596
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:08,553
far into the abyss of vengeance. Bruce finds
Andrea's locket in the Batcave, and it's revealed

597
00:55:08,593 --> 00:55:14,655
that Andrea survived the explosions and is hiding
away on a boat. Batman, meanwhile, remains

598
00:55:14,695 --> 00:55:19,756
committed to his vow of vengeance against the
criminal element of Gotham City. And that's

599
00:55:19,796 --> 00:55:25,251
the end of the movie. Makes me wonder, did Batman
assume that Andrea- died in the explosion and

600
00:55:25,311 --> 00:55:31,156
if so why did he assume that when he saw her
teleport? I don't think he assumed that she

601
00:55:31,216 --> 00:55:34,959
died especially considering the fact that he
found the locket in the cave. I think that

602
00:55:34,979 --> 00:55:40,163
was a clear indicator that she was still alive
and that she had kind of given up on their

603
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:44,847
relationship because she didn't need the locket
anymore. I think really this whole thing kind

604
00:55:44,887 --> 00:55:51,993
of just embittered him in a way which in turn
kind of renewed his commitment to his cause.

605
00:55:52,538 --> 00:55:58,222
Like if she died, he would be sad. But I think
he was more angry or at least it came across

606
00:55:58,262 --> 00:56:02,685
that way to me in the final shot of the film.
I wonder what she did with the Joker considering,

607
00:56:02,725 --> 00:56:06,868
you know, she got away. It seems like she had
a change of heart and decided to just not kill

608
00:56:06,908 --> 00:56:17,076
him and then, you know, go into hiding as Lois
Lane. Headcanon. No, who knows? Like they should

609
00:56:17,116 --> 00:56:24,176
have addressed that fact. because it's just
a weird anticlimactic element of this film

610
00:56:24,636 --> 00:56:29,379
that just kind of sucks. I don't know what else
to say about it. She was on this mission of

611
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:34,942
vengeance. There's no real sign that she was
willing to change or would change. So why wouldn't

612
00:56:35,002 --> 00:56:39,645
she have killed the Joker? Maybe he got away.
Maybe the Joker was too good and he escaped.

613
00:56:39,985 --> 00:56:44,447
Well, then you would think that Andrea would
never stop in her pursuit to kill the Joker

614
00:56:44,487 --> 00:56:50,170
and would end up in Gotham City once again.
I don't know, man. Exactly. That's the problem.

615
00:56:50,631 --> 00:56:57,435
One of several in this movie, which I feel almost
bad not liking more. I feel like I should like

616
00:56:57,455 --> 00:57:02,419
it more because critics really liked it. But
again, I think critics just weren't watching

617
00:57:02,659 --> 00:57:07,522
a reading a lot of stuff that you and I are
watching and reading now or have in the past

618
00:57:07,682 --> 00:57:13,254
to justify such a high rating for this film,
like On Rotten Tomatoes. I think at the time

619
00:57:13,274 --> 00:57:17,818
a lot of critics were comparing Batman Mask
of the Phantasm to the live action movies that

620
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:22,122
we were getting at the time. I think when this
came out it was following Batman Returns and

621
00:57:22,162 --> 00:57:26,506
I would agree that this movie is better than
Batman Returns. I don't know if it's better

622
00:57:26,546 --> 00:57:32,591
than the 1989 Batman movie but better than Burton's
follow-up and certainly better than the Schumacher

623
00:57:32,631 --> 00:57:37,335
films that came out later. Maybe that's the
case? Maybe they liked it because it was really

624
00:57:37,375 --> 00:57:43,311
the first foray that the general... non-comic
book reading public got into Batman's psyche.

625
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:49,033
That's gotta be it. Yeah, that's the best thing
going for this film hands down and one that

626
00:57:49,113 --> 00:57:55,116
really has yet to be done as well arguably in
any subsequent film, except for maybe The Batman.

627
00:57:55,356 --> 00:58:01,719
So you're probably right. Now overall, despite
its strong themes of vengeance and duty, the

628
00:58:01,879 --> 00:58:08,101
obvious mystery reveal and plot holes prevent
the film from comparing to Batman's best stories.

629
00:58:08,542 --> 00:58:14,826
like Batman Begins, like The Dark Knight, like
even Batman Year One. Those were all much better

630
00:58:15,227 --> 00:58:21,031
origins for the character and it's really difficult
not to make those comparisons. I know critics

631
00:58:21,071 --> 00:58:26,436
weren't able to do that when this film came
out in theaters, but I'm reviewing it now and

632
00:58:26,496 --> 00:58:32,260
that's really the only way I can review it.
I'm giving it three and a half stars, a fresh

633
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:38,624
rating on Rotten Tomatoes. I would agree with
that rating. It's still a good movie, but when

634
00:58:38,644 --> 00:58:44,008
you compare it to some of the more recent Batman
animated films that we've gotten, such as,

635
00:58:44,168 --> 00:58:50,212
you know, Batman Year 1, or especially Batman
The Long Halloween, that was fantastic. Yes.

636
00:58:51,033 --> 00:58:56,777
Again, I just don't think that this movie, while
good for its time, holds up in comparison to

637
00:58:56,797 --> 00:59:01,022
the newer stuff. Absolutely, and it kind of
makes you wonder, like, what if Warner Brothers

638
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:06,624
released animated films like Batman Year One
or Batman the Long Halloween in theaters? Like,

639
00:59:06,664 --> 00:59:10,545
how would critics respond and how would the
box office respond? I think they should do

640
00:59:10,585 --> 00:59:15,566
it. I mean, look at how well the Spider-Verse
movies do. I think Batman the Long Halloween

641
00:59:15,707 --> 00:59:19,548
has a chance of holding up just as well with
general audiences considering how well that

642
00:59:19,588 --> 00:59:24,769
was made. I agree. I agree. Although, I mean,
you know, the Spider-Verse movies are on a

643
00:59:24,809 --> 00:59:28,907
whole other level animation-wise. You would
have to get up to that level of animation,

644
00:59:29,087 --> 00:59:33,709
I think, for the general audiences to really
make a push to go see it. Because Mask of the

645
00:59:33,729 --> 00:59:39,252
Phantasm was not a box office success in theaters.
It later became a success on home video. And

646
00:59:39,292 --> 00:59:44,776
now that, you know, Spider-Verse has set the
bar for animated films in theaters, things

647
00:59:44,796 --> 00:59:50,539
like Mask of the Phantasm are kind of embarrassing
by comparison. That's right. Marvel likes to

648
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:54,941
embarrass DC. That's one of my favorite things
about Marvel. Did I say embarrassing? I meant...

649
00:59:55,934 --> 01:00:01,589
I don't know, embarrassing. Damn it. But that
does it for this review. AG9K, help close this
