00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,963
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:28,493
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:33,697
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based

4
00:00:33,817 --> 00:00:40,042
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother, Johnny DC. And in this episode,

5
00:00:40,062 --> 00:00:46,027
we're going to find out who'd win in a fight
between the multiversal characters of Rocket

6
00:00:46,127 --> 00:00:51,583
from Milestone Comics and Spider-Gwen. from
Marvel Comics, but from an alternate universe.

7
00:00:51,723 --> 00:00:55,425
Yeah, this is the second week we're pitting
multiversal characters against each other.

8
00:00:55,565 --> 00:01:01,228
Of course, last week we pit Ultraman against
Hyperion. This week we wanted to do a Spider-Girl

9
00:01:01,288 --> 00:01:06,992
type episode in lead up to our next episode,
which is a review of Madame Web, which takes

10
00:01:07,032 --> 00:01:12,735
place, you could say, in an MCU adjacent universe
made by Sony. Right, yeah, we're trying to

11
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:18,682
squeeze in these multiversal duels, considering
that both Madame Web and the recent DC animated

12
00:01:18,722 --> 00:01:23,743
movie that came out, Crisis on Infinite Earths,
deal with comic book and movie multiverses.

13
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:27,324
Both of these characters are pretty awesome,
so I'm really interested in seeing who will

14
00:01:27,344 --> 00:01:30,525
win. But we'll figure that out later on. Before
that, we're going to break down the latest

15
00:01:30,565 --> 00:01:36,267
comic book movie news to come out this past
week, including the incredible trailer that

16
00:01:36,307 --> 00:01:40,108
we got over the Super Bowl for Deadpool and
Wolverine. That's the name of the movie now.

17
00:01:40,128 --> 00:01:44,389
It's no longer Deadpool 3. It's Deadpool and
Wolverine. Can't wait to talk about that. We

18
00:01:44,449 --> 00:01:49,244
also got confirmation. from Matt Shackman who's
gonna direct the upcoming Fantastic Four movie

19
00:01:49,504 --> 00:01:54,928
that Pedro Pascal is indeed confirmed to be
playing Mr. Fantastic. Yeah, a lot of big Marvel

48
00:04:27,004 --> 00:04:33,768
to the No Prize! A No Prize is an award Marvel
used to give out to fans. Our version, the

49
00:04:33,808 --> 00:04:38,891
Dynamic Duel No Prize, is a digital award we
post on Instagram for the person that we feel

50
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:43,902
gave the best answer to our question of the
week. Last week we asked... Who has been your

51
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:49,805
favorite Supergirl actress across film and television
and why? And this is coming off of the news

52
00:04:50,145 --> 00:04:55,628
that Millie Alcock has been cast as Supergirl
for James Gunn's DCU. We got four answers,

53
00:04:55,648 --> 00:04:59,590
so we're going to break down the honorable mentions
before revealing this week's no prize winner.

54
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:06,474
Our first honorable mention goes to Travis Herndon
who said, Hey guys, Travis here. So my pick

55
00:05:06,494 --> 00:05:11,136
would have to be the Supergirl from the Flash
movie, although she's not the one that we all

56
00:05:11,156 --> 00:05:18,048
know with the blonde hair and the skirt. was
a pretty bad ass version of Supergirl and honestly

57
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:25,592
it's a shame that we won't see her in this James
Gunn DCU but hey, hey maybe the actress might

58
00:05:25,632 --> 00:05:29,414
come back as I don't know maybe like Wonder
Woman's daughter or something but she's my

59
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:35,158
favorite she's just an all around badass Latino
hero. Yes so Sasha Kaia played Supergirl in

60
00:05:35,178 --> 00:05:40,581
the recent flash film that came out last year
she didn't have the largest role in the movie

61
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:45,564
but the time she did have on screen. I thought
she did a phenomenal job with. Yeah, she didn't

62
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:50,328
look like your typical super girl who is portrayed
in the comics, usually as having long blonde

63
00:05:50,368 --> 00:05:54,632
hair and wearing a red skirt and stuff like
that. But I thought Sasha Kaia fucking killed

64
00:05:54,692 --> 00:06:00,637
it as this analog to Henry Cavill's Superman
within this newly created timeline that The

65
00:06:00,657 --> 00:06:04,861
Flash started when he went back in time. Yeah,
the character herself is actually based on

66
00:06:04,981 --> 00:06:09,625
a design from the Injustice comics. She was
Superman's daughter. And I thought they nailed

67
00:06:09,645 --> 00:06:14,573
that design. perfectly. She looked incredible
in the movie. So great answer, Travis. Our

68
00:06:14,653 --> 00:06:20,278
next honorable mention goes to Miggie Mathingian,
who said, Hey, what's up, guys? This is Miggie.

69
00:06:20,638 --> 00:06:25,423
And my favorite Supergirl actress would probably
be Summer Glau. I think that's how you pronounce

70
00:06:25,483 --> 00:06:31,168
it. From Superman, Batman, Apocalypse. I think
she just had the best job or did the best job

71
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:37,133
displaying like a full range of emotions from
her fear and confusion from first landing here

72
00:06:37,153 --> 00:06:44,418
on Earth. to her grief at the death of her friend
and to her anger at fighting Darkseid at the

73
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,623
last battle. Thanks guys. Yeah, Superman Batman
Apocalypse is an animated film that was based

74
00:06:49,803 --> 00:06:55,727
on a comic run written by Jeff Loeb, if I'm
not mistaken. It was a fantastic run. It reintroduced

75
00:06:55,807 --> 00:07:02,413
the character of Kara Zor-El to the main DC
continuity. And yeah, it was a great like origin

76
00:07:02,453 --> 00:07:07,022
story for the character. They did a great job
adapting it to the animated film. And there's

77
00:07:07,062 --> 00:07:13,124
been a lot of great actresses to do voiceover
work for the character of Supergirl. In this

78
00:07:13,164 --> 00:07:19,186
movie, in DC Superhero Girls, in the Superman
animated series, they've all done a fantastic

79
00:07:19,226 --> 00:07:24,208
job. And the recent Legion of Superheroes film
that takes place in the Tomorrowverse. Oh,

80
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:29,369
that's right. That was voiced by Megan Donnelly,
the actress who almost became Supergirl in

81
00:07:29,429 --> 00:07:33,752
live action. Now we haven't reviewed Superman
Batman Apocalypse yet, but it is definitely

82
00:07:33,932 --> 00:07:40,576
on our list of animated DC films to eventually
get to. We only have about like 50 projects

83
00:07:40,636 --> 00:07:47,019
left to review for Marvel and DC that aren't
new, so not too many. I imagine we'll get through

84
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:53,003
quite a few this year considering how few theatrical
releases DC and Marvel are putting out. Yeah

85
00:07:53,023 --> 00:07:57,265
for sure. Great answer, Miggy. But the winner
of this week's Snow Prize goes to two people.

86
00:07:57,718 --> 00:08:03,240
both Abner O'Terry and Peter Troll who both
gave the same answer. And they said, Hey guys,

87
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:10,683
it's Abner O'Terry. My answer is Melissa Pinoist
because she was able to be funny and smart

88
00:08:11,403 --> 00:08:20,607
and her relationships with her adopted sister
and the rest of the cast were just phenomenal.

89
00:08:21,228 --> 00:08:28,167
Hey guys, it's Peter. My answer for the best
Supergirl. is probably Melissa Benoist from

90
00:08:28,207 --> 00:08:33,350
the CW show. I thought she looked the part,
I thought she played the part very well, and

91
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:39,013
something about those CW shows just really have
a grip on my heart. But also, I may be a little

92
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:43,436
biased because I thought she was cute and maybe
had a little crush. But yeah, Melissa Benoist

93
00:08:43,496 --> 00:08:48,959
is my choice. Thanks, guys. So, normally I like
to give points for originality here, but it

94
00:08:48,979 --> 00:08:54,934
was really hard not to award the answer of Melissa
Benoist! Because yeah, who doesn't have a crush

95
00:08:55,014 --> 00:08:59,675
on her? She did a fantastic job in the role
of Supergirl. Honestly, I think she's the best

96
00:08:59,755 --> 00:09:04,096
actress to play the character ever. Well, she
certainly has had the most substantial role

97
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:10,038
as Supergirl, considering she had so many seasons
on her own television series. Right, as compared

98
00:09:10,058 --> 00:09:15,779
to someone like Helen Slater who had her own
movie, but the movie was terrible. The Supergirl

99
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:22,121
show wasn't for the most part. Yeah, here are
the first few seasons. Like all of the DCCW

100
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:26,450
shows were actually pretty good. Yes, yeah,
that is correct. So congrats to Abner O'Terry

101
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:30,636
and Peter Troll. Both of you win this week's
no prize. If you, the listener, want a shot

102
00:09:30,656 --> 00:09:34,282
at winning your own no prize, stay tuned to
later on this episode when we'll be asking

103
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:38,789
another question of the week. And now that that's
done, onto the news.

104
00:09:44,226 --> 00:09:49,490
All right, this past week, right before the
big game, we got the official teaser for the

105
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,794
upcoming Deadpool and Wolverine movie. Now,
you know, we've been calling it Deadpool 3

106
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:57,257
this whole time, but it was announced with this
teaser that the movie is officially called

107
00:09:57,397 --> 00:10:02,862
Deadpool and Wolverine. So they split the billing.
That's pretty cool. The trailer was great.

108
00:10:03,182 --> 00:10:07,265
I'm so excited to get into this. Yeah, the name
is kind of smart, I would say, just because

109
00:10:07,286 --> 00:10:12,894
of how big of a name Wolverine is. I would still
say as popular as Deadpool is, His name isn't

110
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:17,577
quite as big as Wolverine, so I think that's
a huge selling point. And what's funny is that

111
00:10:17,637 --> 00:10:22,841
earlier this year, Hugh Jackman released a video
and he inadvertently called the movie Wolverine

112
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:27,304
and Deadpool, so I wonder if that's going to
be kind of like a running gag where they kind

113
00:10:27,324 --> 00:10:33,348
of fight over who gets top billing. Yeah, that'd
be great. The teaser trailer starts off with

114
00:10:33,468 --> 00:10:39,832
Deadpool's birthday, and everyone from X-Force
is there, including Shatterstar, Pete, Doepinder's

115
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:45,167
there, Vanessa's back. It looks like At the
end of Deadpool 2, he used Cable's time sliding

116
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:49,629
device to basically save all of his friends.
Yeah, I was really surprised to see characters

117
00:10:49,669 --> 00:10:54,611
like Shatterstar, but definitely implied that
yeah he probably broke some TVA rules saving

118
00:10:54,671 --> 00:11:00,874
all of his friends from death. Which is why
the TVA shows up at his house and we get one

119
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:05,736
of the best gags in the entire Deadpool franchise
just in this teaser where he's like, is that

120
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:10,230
supposed to scare anybody? Piggings not new
to me, friendo, but it is to Disney. and he

121
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:15,614
looks at the camera breaking the fourth wall.
So good. And it was in continuity because we

122
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:21,620
saw him be pegged in the first Deadpool movie
on International Women's Day. So good on them

123
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,704
for sticking to the established canon. It was
also a nice way to just right off the bat address

124
00:11:26,764 --> 00:11:34,071
the whole purchase of Fox by Disney between
Deadpool 2 and 3. Well, actually they address

125
00:11:34,091 --> 00:11:39,422
that in Once Upon a Deadpool. Oh, I never saw
that. Yeah. Well, it was the PG-13 of Deadpool

126
00:11:39,462 --> 00:11:43,543
2 that they released around the holidays when
Deadpool 2 came out. He basically stated in

127
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:49,145
that movie that the reason they wanted to do
a PG-13 version was because of Disney. Okay.

128
00:11:49,165 --> 00:11:53,566
Yeah, I wonder if that's canon. I don't know,
but I'm glad to see that this movie obviously

129
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:59,268
will not be PG-13. I'm glad that Deadpool is
sticking to its hard R roots. Because honestly,

130
00:11:59,668 --> 00:12:03,989
Once Upon Deadpool wasn't that great. It was
okay. But in this teaser, Deadpool gets taken

131
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:08,604
to the TVA. where he's talking to some guy.
I kind of wish that the guy in the chair talking

132
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:14,389
to him was Mobius, who is a character played
by Owen Wilson in the Loki television series,

133
00:12:14,509 --> 00:12:18,272
but it's not. He's some British dude. There's
a great gag there where he tells Deadpool that

134
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:22,476
he sold himself while unconscious, and he's
like, I wasn't unconscious, where am I? So

135
00:12:22,656 --> 00:12:28,761
good. Dude, that's not just some dude. That's
fucking Matthew McFadden, the recent Emmy winner

136
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:35,670
for Secession. He's a fantastic actor. I don't
give a fuck who that is. You will you will

137
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:40,752
the guy is just an incredible actor. I think
he's gonna kill it in this role Yeah, sure.

138
00:12:40,772 --> 00:12:44,614
You still should have been Mobius. I mean isn't
Owen Wilson supposed to have a cameo in this

139
00:12:44,654 --> 00:12:48,876
movie Yeah, but like, you know, he could have
had a substantial role here I don't know what

140
00:12:48,896 --> 00:12:55,199
kind of story they're setting up but apparently
Deadpool has to help save the MCU For some

141
00:12:55,219 --> 00:13:00,181
reason and he calls himself Marvel Jesus, which
is kind of funny I don't quite know what the

142
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:05,511
threat is though because we see him take on
the TVA itself for a vast majority of this

143
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:10,372
teaser. There's a lot of quick shots of him
like suiting up and then we see him in this

144
00:13:10,412 --> 00:13:16,914
swanky place, what appears to be a Magi-Pore
casino because we see him approaching Wolverine

145
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:21,115
in his Patch persona from behind. So that's
pretty cool. We're going to see Hugh Jackman

146
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:26,897
not only in his comic accurate Wolverine get
up, but we also get to see his alter ego of

147
00:13:26,997 --> 00:13:33,199
Patch. How do you know it's Patch? Because Wolverine's
persona of Patch wears a white suit. Oh, okay.

148
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,161
I just love the suit up scene where it's like
something from Batman Forever or Batman and

149
00:13:38,181 --> 00:13:42,003
Robin or just different like closeups. But there's
also a scene where like someone's like slapping

150
00:13:42,043 --> 00:13:47,385
his ass just like randomly tossed in there.
And then Kim doing the splits and like sliding

151
00:13:47,485 --> 00:13:54,128
upwards and doing like a dance move. I felt
that, I felt it. I was like, hell yeah. It

152
00:13:54,188 --> 00:14:00,018
looks like actually both Deadpool and Wolverine
get pruned. and go to the void at the end of

153
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:05,743
time, where it's kind of post-apocalyptic. We
see the 20th century Fox logo there, just in

154
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:10,787
the sand. We do see what I think is Eliath for
a brief shot, taking out one of the TVA members.

155
00:14:10,947 --> 00:14:15,711
And I think a vast majority of the film takes
place in the void. And it seems like the film

156
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:20,155
was mainly about escaping it. Which is honestly
pretty cool. I love the fact that we get to

157
00:14:20,195 --> 00:14:26,720
see other X-Men characters there, like fucking
Pyro. That was a surprise. Yeah, Aaron Stanford

158
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:31,598
as Pyro makes a guest appearance here. That
was great. Cool to see him back. I can't wait

159
00:14:31,618 --> 00:14:37,620
to see everyone back. It's gonna be the No Way
Home of X-Men movies. And it seems like it's

160
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,082
gonna be even bigger than that. Well, I mean,
the X-Men franchise has already had its No

161
00:14:42,122 --> 00:14:47,984
Way Home movie in days of future past, where
you got a merger of the two big franchises,

162
00:14:48,024 --> 00:14:52,965
like with James McAvoy and Patrick Stewart and
Michael Fassbender and Dean McKellen. But Deadpool

163
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:58,352
3 also has the other. task of merging the Foxverse
with the MCU. It looks like a whole lot of

164
00:14:58,372 --> 00:15:03,154
fun. I really like the last shot where Deadpool's
like injured, hurt on his back and he's like,

165
00:15:03,174 --> 00:15:07,116
don't just stand there, Harry Ape help me up.
And Wolverine unsheathes his claws and he's

166
00:15:07,136 --> 00:15:13,320
like, oh never mind, I'm fine. Great way to
segue into the title card of the film, which

167
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,523
again revealed the new title Deadpool and Wolverine.
As well as the release date, which we all know

168
00:15:18,643 --> 00:15:24,574
of July 26th. It's coming out this summer. Cannot
wait. I'm so hyped for it. I hope a lot of

169
00:15:24,594 --> 00:15:29,216
people saw this trailer and are also hyped as
well because, you know, a lot of people are

170
00:15:29,256 --> 00:15:33,437
kind of souring on the MCU as a whole and it'll
be great to have them back. Yeah, it does kind

171
00:15:33,477 --> 00:15:39,640
of seem like this movie will in fact be Marvel
Jesus. It'll save the MCU. Right. It almost

172
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,882
makes me wonder if like Ryan Reynolds has been
telling Kevin Feige that, yeah, make these

173
00:15:45,342 --> 00:15:50,865
upcoming Marvel projects like really sucky so
that my movie can save it. Obviously, that's

174
00:15:50,925 --> 00:15:55,583
not the case, but it almost feels that way.
I was wondering if the TVA is like, oh, these

175
00:15:55,783 --> 00:15:58,725
projects have been sucking. Like we need you
to save it. And he's like, yeah, I'm going

176
00:15:58,745 --> 00:16:04,608
to save it. I do have to say that I'm kind of
bummed that they didn't show the last shot

177
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:10,211
of Wolverine in costume as brief as that was
during the Super Bowl teaser, because, you

178
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:13,573
know, it was much shorter what they showed on
television. And then they were like, see the

179
00:16:13,593 --> 00:16:17,916
full trailer online. I hate when they do that.
I know it's a way for the studio to save money

180
00:16:17,936 --> 00:16:22,518
because those Super Bowl commercial admin, it's
are pretty pricey. But still they should have

181
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:26,903
shown that specific shot because everyone who
saw that would have gotten totally pumped up.

182
00:16:27,704 --> 00:16:31,908
Now you gotta save the money shot for later.
It's just a teaser. Just tease them and keep

183
00:16:31,928 --> 00:16:36,192
them coming back for more. We'll see Wolverine
in costume and I bet you it'll be in the next

184
00:16:36,272 --> 00:16:40,497
trailer that we get. Hopefully, it will be.
You're probably right. But the teaser trailer

185
00:16:40,517 --> 00:16:44,881
looked great, super pumped. It was super funny.
And that brings us to our question of the week.

186
00:16:49,314 --> 00:16:54,138
What has been your favorite Deadpool joke out
of all Deadpool media? There's been a lot of

187
00:16:54,158 --> 00:16:57,781
them out there. There was the video game, the
Deadpool movies, there's the Deadpool comics.

188
00:16:58,302 --> 00:17:02,986
What made you laugh the hardest and why? Yeah,
even the Deadpool teaser trailers. Why not?

before February 17th. In other news from Marvel

194
00:17:26,321 --> 00:17:31,585
coming out this past week, we got a confirmation
not only from the Screen Actors Guild of America,

195
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:37,149
but also the director of Fantastic Four himself,
Matt Shacman, that Pedro Pascal has been cast

196
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:44,511
as Reed Richards' Mr. Fantastic in the upcoming
Fantastic Four film. Now... This has been rumored

197
00:17:44,571 --> 00:17:49,875
for a couple of months now. The news was previously
dropped by Deadline, I believe, or Variety.

198
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:54,519
They reported that Pedro Pascal was in talks
to play the character. But you know, when the

199
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,303
director tweets out that the actor is playing
the role, it's pretty much confirmed. Loathe

200
00:17:59,363 --> 00:18:04,107
as I am to say that Pedro Pascal got the role
because I was really hoping for John Krasinski

201
00:18:04,147 --> 00:18:09,931
to return as Mr. Fantastic from his cameo in
Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Venice, but

202
00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:16,476
I am a Pedro Pascal fan. Yeah. The dude is hella
cool. Like when I grew up, I wanna be Pedro

203
00:18:16,516 --> 00:18:22,279
Pascal. He does not necessarily look the part
of Reed Richards, at least not as I know him

204
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:27,982
from the comics. That's not to say that the
man cannot play this role. He looks like him

205
00:18:28,062 --> 00:18:32,945
enough, and I think he can act the shit out
of this role. Oh, absolutely. Honestly, if

206
00:18:32,965 --> 00:18:37,848
you had to give me a choice between who's more
charismatic, Pedro Pascal or John Krasinski,

207
00:18:38,268 --> 00:18:43,218
Pedro Pascal. Honestly, I feel like... The whole
reason he was cast was sort of to be like a

208
00:18:43,338 --> 00:18:49,520
new Robert Downey Jr. esque replacement for
the MCU. Yeah, maybe. I mean, you want as many

209
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:54,382
charismatic lead actors in these franchises
as you can get with all the actors that you

210
00:18:54,422 --> 00:18:59,543
have at your disposal. Someone like Pedro Pascal
is certainly more charismatic than say Adam

211
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:04,965
Driver, who was previously rumored to be offered
the role of Mr. Fantastic. And honestly, yeah,

212
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:09,943
I am glad that Pedro Pascal got it over Adam
Driver. He's a little bit older, but, you know,

213
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:16,147
not as old as, say, Robert Downey Jr. Yeah.
Now, Pedro Pascal is no stranger to the world

214
00:19:16,227 --> 00:19:21,590
of comic book movies. He did play the villain
of Maxwell Lord in the Wonder Woman 1984 film.

215
00:19:22,091 --> 00:19:28,235
And he was one of the best parts of that movie.
Yeah, sure. Well, I mean, I guess there was

216
00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:31,917
no good part of that movie, honestly. Shut the
hell up. But I think Pedro Pascal will make

217
00:19:31,938 --> 00:19:36,861
a better Reed Richards than he did Maxwell Lord.
I'm sure he'll nail the role. Yeah. Now, joining

218
00:19:36,941 --> 00:19:44,523
Pedro Pascal. Rounding out the Fantastic Four
cast, allegedly is Vanessa Kirby as the Invisible

219
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:49,105
Woman. Which is perfection. I woulda know, I
don't think I've seen her in anything. She

220
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:55,366
was in The Crown. I'm ashamed that I know that.
Um, but no, she's fantastic. I think she's

221
00:19:55,386 --> 00:19:59,988
gonna be great in the role. Joseph Quinn will
be playing the Human Torch, who I'm also not

222
00:20:00,028 --> 00:20:05,889
familiar with, and I hope I'm pronouncing this
right, Ebon Moss-Bachrock will be playing the

223
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:11,427
Thing. who I am familiar with because he played
Micro in season one of the Punisher Netflix

224
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:17,090
television series. I mean, he's no Michael Chiglis,
but he's a good actor too. They all look the

225
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,772
parts. It's a really interesting cast. I'm sure
that they'll nail it. None of this has officially

226
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:26,874
been confirmed, but it's all but confirmed,
we'll say. So an exciting time to be an MCU

227
00:20:26,914 --> 00:20:34,257
fan. I hope as soon as they release this news
officially, that Marvel also produces a screen

228
00:20:34,297 --> 00:20:39,150
test of what the costumes look like. Cause I
want to see Pedro Pascal, you know, with the

229
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:44,552
gray temples in the blue suit. Think it'd be
awesome just to get a feel for it. Yes, absolutely.

230
00:20:45,072 --> 00:20:49,633
I bet you will see that at this year's Comic-Con.
Hopefully that'd be cool. Honestly, like I'm

231
00:20:49,673 --> 00:20:55,935
hella jealous this week. They have such like
cool news for Marvel. Where's the DC news?

232
00:20:56,375 --> 00:21:01,376
Like where's the Joker, Valiant Dude trailer?
Where's like the Superman screen test? Come

233
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:07,066
on. I want a Superman teaser poster at the very
least. Like yesterday. That's not going to

234
00:21:07,086 --> 00:21:12,672
happen because DC is dumb. And Marvel's the
best. And they just reminded everybody of that

235
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:18,999
this week. And your silence right now speaks
volumes. I'm just quietly seething and plotting

236
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,601
your demise. Ha ha ha.

237
00:21:27,534 --> 00:21:30,838
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and get into

238
00:21:30,878 --> 00:21:36,285
our main event where we find out who'd win in
a fight between the multiversal characters

239
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:39,649
of Rocket and Spider-Gwen.

240
00:21:54,550 --> 00:22:00,835
Alright, Rocket versus Spider-Gwen, also known
as Spider-Woman, also known as Ghost Spider,

241
00:22:01,135 --> 00:22:06,620
but colloquially best probably known as Spider-Gwen.
We're pitting her up against Rocket, who is

242
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:12,646
a character from Milestone Comics, best known
as the sidekick to the hero Icon, but she also

243
00:22:12,666 --> 00:22:18,491
had a stint in the Young Justice animated television
series. Right, which is a series focused around

244
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:23,926
sidekicks, and so yeah, she played a role in
the show. She's a prominent black character

245
00:22:24,166 --> 00:22:30,328
as all milestone media superheroes are because
it's a black-owned comics company that focuses

246
00:22:30,408 --> 00:22:35,970
on creating and fostering great BIPOC characters
in comics. So we also figured that this was

247
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:40,691
a great tie-in to Black History Month. We've
never done a milestone comics character before.

248
00:22:41,071 --> 00:22:46,973
They're quasi-multi-versal. They were for a
time brought into Prime DC continuity. But

249
00:22:47,053 --> 00:22:51,062
yeah, I thought she counted as a multi-versal
character. And the reason that we thought this

250
00:22:51,083 --> 00:22:57,167
would be a good match and our executive producers
agreed was due to their power sets both being

251
00:22:57,367 --> 00:23:03,031
based around basically speed and durability
with some range based attacks. Exactly. Yeah.

252
00:23:03,472 --> 00:23:07,295
So let's get into it to explain the methodology
behind our duels. Let's go to our sentient

253
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:13,119
dual simulator Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K tell
our listeners how you go about determining

254
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:18,370
a winner in our dual matchups. Yes, of course,
sir. The way I determine a winner between the

255
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:24,432
contestants is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations
using the characters statistics. A Monte Carlo

256
00:23:24,472 --> 00:23:28,753
simulation is a probabilistic model used to
determine outcomes through random sampling.

257
00:23:29,193 --> 00:23:34,094
In this case, I randomise the statistics along
a normal distribution as a way to simulate

258
00:23:34,114 --> 00:23:38,695
the many variables that can occur during battle.
The stat parameters are based on the official

259
00:23:38,755 --> 00:23:42,857
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters
statistics are extrapolated.

260
00:23:46,306 --> 00:23:51,429
damage potential, versatility and perception
in order to create a more detailed and accurate

261
00:23:51,449 --> 00:23:56,854
simulation. The results of the 1000 simulations
provide a percentage of wins for each character.

262
00:23:57,294 --> 00:24:01,877
The contestant with the higher percentage is
declared the victor as they have a higher probability

263
00:24:01,918 --> 00:24:07,742
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,
neither character should win 100% of the matches.

264
00:24:08,242 --> 00:24:12,726
The comic book stories have shown that there's
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman. So

265
00:24:12,746 --> 00:24:16,628
the confidence rate of my method falls in line
with the precedents that have been established

266
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:22,211
in the source material. My mathematical simulations
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are

267
00:24:22,251 --> 00:24:26,654
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes
tabulated for determination of the winner.

268
00:24:28,114 --> 00:24:33,057
Thanks AJ9K! Before we run the simulations though,
we like to break down each character's histories

269
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:38,541
and abilities before improvising a scenario
on how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations

270
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:44,020
would play out, beat for beat. And it's my turn
to go first with the DC character, so let me

271
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:50,944
tell you all about Rocket. Now Raquel Irvin
was born and raised on Paris Island, the poorest

272
00:24:51,124 --> 00:24:58,048
neighborhood of the fictional city of Dakota
in the alternate universe of Earth 1993, aka

273
00:24:58,188 --> 00:25:05,273
Earth-M, aka the Dakotaverse. Paris Island was
notorious for its high crime rates and violent

274
00:25:05,313 --> 00:25:11,229
gang warfare. which culminated in a massive
war and riot between all of the gangs in the

275
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:17,454
neighborhood on one night known as the Big Bang.
That same night, knowing the police would have

276
00:25:17,494 --> 00:25:23,019
their hands full, Raquel's boyfriend Noble and
his friends drove her to the wealthy Dakota

277
00:25:23,059 --> 00:25:28,923
suburb of Prospect Hills to help burglarize
one of its mansions. Though Raquel was a bright

278
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:34,328
15-year-old girl as an aspiring writer, the
idea of getting her hands on a typewriter or

279
00:25:34,348 --> 00:25:39,504
computer proved too tempting. and she agreed
to join them. Though they believed they were

280
00:25:39,544 --> 00:25:44,788
stealing from a rich white man, in reality,
they were stealing from Augustus Freeman IV,

281
00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:50,833
a black corporate lawyer who was secretly an
ancient and superpowered alien stranded on

282
00:25:50,973 --> 00:25:56,758
Earth. Augustus confronted the youths, surviving
multiple gunshots and flying to catch those

283
00:25:56,798 --> 00:26:02,363
attempting to flee, including Raquel. Freeman
let them go on the condition that they told

284
00:26:02,503 --> 00:26:08,334
no one about him and promised never to steal
again. Inspired by what he could do, Raquel

285
00:26:08,374 --> 00:26:14,477
later went back to Freeman's mansion with sketches
of him and her in superhero costumes, encouraging

286
00:26:14,517 --> 00:26:20,460
him to use his powers to help his community
as a superhero named Icon, while making her

287
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:25,822
his sidekick or partner, Rocket, so that she
could have adventures to write about. Freeman

288
00:26:25,862 --> 00:26:31,044
was reluctant initially, but was inspired by
Raquel and Dakota's recent upheaval during

289
00:26:31,064 --> 00:26:36,916
the Big Bang to adopt the superhero identity
of Icon, and gift Raquel with a belt made from

290
00:26:37,076 --> 00:26:42,661
alien technology that would allow her to fight
alongside him. Despite initially being mistaken

291
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:47,505
for criminals during their first mission to
rescue Dakota's mayor, Thomasina Jefferson,

292
00:26:48,026 --> 00:26:53,271
Icon and Rocket successfully saved the mayor
from a mutated monster known as Payback, who

293
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:58,615
revealed to them that during the night of the
Big Bang, Mayor Jefferson authorized the local

294
00:26:58,655 --> 00:27:03,759
police department to use an experimental tear
gas that was laced with a radioactive marker

295
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:09,463
that would allow them to subdue and later track
the gang members involved. Instead, the tear

296
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:15,487
gas killed all but a small minority that either
mutated or developed special powers. While

297
00:27:15,607 --> 00:27:21,391
Icahn investigated Payback's claims as a lawyer,
Raquel dealt with the realization from Icahn's

298
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:27,103
superhuman senses that she was in early-stage
pregnancy. Though Noble and her mother Sandra

299
00:27:27,183 --> 00:27:33,246
encouraged Raquel to have an abortion, Raquel
decided to keep the baby. After several adventures,

300
00:27:33,426 --> 00:27:38,769
including taking on the Big Bang-powered gang
known as the Blood Syndicate, Raquel was forced

301
00:27:38,869 --> 00:27:44,473
to give up superheroics and allowed her best
friend Darnice to assume the mantle of Rocket

302
00:27:44,513 --> 00:27:50,876
for a short time. Raquel eventually gave birth
to a son, whom she named Amistad Augustus Irvin.

303
00:27:51,276 --> 00:27:56,715
While Raquel was on maternity leave, Freeman
found a way to return to his home planet, supporting

304
00:27:56,795 --> 00:28:02,299
Raquel with a trust that provided her monthly
checks while he was away. When an alien threat

305
00:28:02,359 --> 00:28:08,482
known as Oblivion arrived on Earth to kill Freeman,
Icon returned to Earth, as did Raquel as his

306
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:14,586
partner, Rocket, once again. Upon Oblivion's
defeat, Freeman decided to remain on Earth,

307
00:28:14,866 --> 00:28:20,369
and Raquel continued as his partner while also
raising Amistad. Though Raquel and Freeman

308
00:28:20,509 --> 00:28:26,853
often clashed, due to their conflicting political
viewpoints, Raquel did develop a close relationship

309
00:28:26,973 --> 00:28:33,578
with another teenage hero of the city of Dakota,
Static. As in Static Shock? Yeah, I mean, the

310
00:28:33,598 --> 00:28:37,661
name of the cartoon was Static Shock, but the
character's name is Static. That's right, he's

311
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:42,205
a milestone character. Yes, yeah. Now during
the final crisis, when the villain Darkseid

312
00:28:42,245 --> 00:28:47,749
acquired the anti-life equation in DC's Prime
Universe, the existence of the Dakotaverse

313
00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:54,061
was threatened. though a being known as Dharma
managed to merge the city of Dakota into DC

314
00:28:54,121 --> 00:28:59,805
Prime. Though Freeman remembered Dakota once
being part of a separate universe, Raquel and

315
00:28:59,945 --> 00:29:05,069
other members of Dakota were unaware of the
merger, and Raquel remained Freeman's partner

316
00:29:05,229 --> 00:29:10,553
in the new continuity that was created. In the
new DC universe, Icon was a member of a secret

317
00:29:10,613 --> 00:29:15,596
organization of superheroes known as the Shadow
Cabinet, who were attacked by the Justice League

318
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:21,575
while on a mission to Metropolis. At the behest
of Icon, Rocket joined the Shadow Cabinet and

319
00:29:21,615 --> 00:29:26,717
helped protect its agents from the League, going
toe to toe with Batman. The two teams eventually

320
00:29:26,777 --> 00:29:32,480
joined forces to defeat the villain Shadow Thief,
and Icon and Rocket returned to Dakota, which

321
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:38,082
they continued to protect. In post-Flashpoint
continuity, Raquel's origin remained largely

322
00:29:38,182 --> 00:29:43,664
unchanged, though upon Icon's and Rocket's initial
mission to stop the drug trade, their actions

323
00:29:43,724 --> 00:29:49,176
ended up nearly crippling the global economy.
In response, the United States government hired

324
00:29:49,216 --> 00:29:55,942
an alien assassin known as Mr. Lord to kill
Icon and Rocket. With help from Static, Icon

325
00:29:55,982 --> 00:30:01,567
and Rocket were able to bring down Mr. Lord
instead. Now powers-wise, Rocket is equipped

326
00:30:01,627 --> 00:30:07,532
with an inertia belt made from alien technology
from Icon's escape pod that crash-landed him

327
00:30:07,592 --> 00:30:14,075
on Earth over a century ago. The inertia belt
generates a usually invisible field around

328
00:30:14,155 --> 00:30:19,777
rocket that absorbs the kinetic energy of anything
that crosses its surface, allowing rocket to

329
00:30:19,897 --> 00:30:26,459
store that energy for a variety of uses, including
powerful energy punches, the ability to redirect

330
00:30:26,499 --> 00:30:33,381
that energy into thrown projectiles or focused
energy beams, and high speed flight and maneuverability.

331
00:30:36,714 --> 00:30:41,816
Rocket can also surround opponents in an inertialist
field, preventing them from moving or even

332
00:30:41,856 --> 00:30:47,119
breathing, though this uses a large amount of
her stored energy and can only last for a few

333
00:30:47,199 --> 00:30:53,282
seconds. Any use of the energy stored by her
belt drains some of its power. And that's Rocket!

334
00:30:53,822 --> 00:30:57,824
I don't know much about the Milestone universe.
I completely forgot that static is a part of

335
00:30:57,884 --> 00:31:02,318
it, and it makes me think that we gotta get
static in a duel sometime. Yeah, I would say

336
00:31:02,518 --> 00:31:07,561
Static and Icon are kind of the flagship characters
of Milestone, although there's also Hardware.

337
00:31:07,921 --> 00:31:14,244
Now, the experimental tear gas that the mayor
used on the gang members, is that the same

338
00:31:14,384 --> 00:31:19,787
mutagen that transformed Static's rogues gallery?
Yes. Yeah, they go into the Big Bang on the

339
00:31:19,827 --> 00:31:23,769
cartoon, although it's a little bit different.
Interesting. Pretty cool character. I'm interested

340
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:28,552
in seeing how this fight will go out, especially
with that inertia belt. But Gwen Stacy's got

341
00:31:28,592 --> 00:31:33,550
some tricks up her sleeves. Let me go into her
backstory. In the Marvel Comics Multiverse,

342
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:40,374
in the timeline of Earth-616, Gwen Stacy was
Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man's, first true

343
00:31:40,414 --> 00:31:45,977
love. The two met at Empire State University
and began dating, however she was tragically

344
00:31:46,017 --> 00:31:50,479
killed by the Green Goblin who threw her off
the George Washington Bridge. You can learn

345
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:54,561
more about the Green Goblin in his duel against
the Joker, and more about Spider-Man in his

346
00:31:54,601 --> 00:31:59,514
duel against Blue Beetle. Gwen's death was a
defining moment in Spider-Man's life where

347
00:31:59,554 --> 00:32:05,316
he realized the full extent of the loss he could
experience as a hero. However, in another universe,

348
00:32:05,616 --> 00:32:11,678
Earth-65, Gwen's Stacey story went a little
different. Born in Forest Hills and Queens

349
00:32:11,738 --> 00:32:17,379
to Helen and George Stacey, Gwen also experienced
loss from a young age when her mother died,

350
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:22,981
leaving her dad, an NYPD captain, to raise her
as a single father. To cope with her grief

351
00:32:23,121 --> 00:32:27,727
and overbearing home life, Gwen rebelled from
her ballerina dancing lessons to take out her

352
00:32:27,747 --> 00:32:32,908
frustrations playing the drums. At Midtown High
School, she became good friends with several

353
00:32:32,928 --> 00:32:38,810
students, including the shy but brilliant Peter
Parker, the rebellious but affluent Harry Osborn,

354
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:44,952
and the outgoing Mary Jane Watson, the latter
of whom also shared a love of music and formed

355
00:32:44,992 --> 00:32:50,394
a band called the Mary Janes with Gwen and their
friends Betty and Glory. One day, Gwen was

356
00:32:50,454 --> 00:32:55,155
bitten by a genetically engineered spider by
random chance, altering her physiology and

357
00:32:55,175 --> 00:32:59,577
granting her the powers of a spider. Though
she initially thought she could use her powers

358
00:32:59,617 --> 00:33:04,838
to win money for her band in a charity wrestling
match, she stumbled upon a thief who was about

359
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:11,020
to kill Ben Parker, her friend Peter's uncle.
After saving Ben's life, she was inspired instead

360
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:16,061
to use her new ability selflessly and became
a masked crime fighter by the name of Spider

361
00:33:16,101 --> 00:33:21,863
Woman. As Gwen's heroic reputation throughout
New York grew, she was gifted a pair of web-shooters

362
00:33:21,983 --> 00:33:27,885
by the retired superhero, the Wasp. Gwen struggled
to balance life as a student, rock musician,

363
00:33:28,145 --> 00:33:32,386
and superhero, but her misfortunes came to a
head during her school prom where she was set

364
00:33:32,406 --> 00:33:38,348
to perform with the Mary Janes. Her friend Peter
Parker idolized Spider-Woman and believed he

365
00:33:38,368 --> 00:33:43,634
could become a hero and avoid being bullied
if he could also get similar superpowers. After

366
00:33:43,694 --> 00:33:49,196
experimenting with lizards, Peter turned himself
into a mindless lizard-like creature that crashed

367
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:54,738
the prom. Unaware that the lizard was her friend
Peter, Gwen asked Spider-Woman beat the creature

368
00:33:54,778 --> 00:34:00,081
despite its pleas to stop. The lizard, severely
injured, reverted back to Peter Parker, who

369
00:34:00,161 --> 00:34:04,983
died from his wounds in Spider-Woman's arms,
his last words stating that he just wanted

370
00:34:05,023 --> 00:34:10,865
to be special like her. Shocked at what she
had done, Gwen fled the scene branded a murderer.

371
00:34:11,478 --> 00:34:15,781
She was pursued by the police, including her
father who saw Spider-Woman as a criminal.

372
00:34:16,241 --> 00:34:20,864
Haunted by Peter's death, she learned that with
great power must come great responsibility

373
00:34:20,924 --> 00:34:26,348
to not abuse that power, and she sought redemption
through helping others. She came out odds with

374
00:34:26,368 --> 00:34:31,211
the Kingpin of Crime and his right-hand man,
a villain named Daredevil, who was the leader

375
00:34:31,271 --> 00:34:36,995
of the Hand Ninja Clan. Looking to appease Spider-Woman
and bring them into their fold as an ally,

376
00:34:37,096 --> 00:34:42,258
the Hand went after police captain George Stacey.
After thwarting the murder attempt, Gwen was

377
00:34:42,298 --> 00:34:47,281
held at gunpoint by her father and was forced
to reveal her secret identity to him. Unable

378
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:52,523
to arrest his daughter, Captain Stacy asked
her to leave before he changed his mind. Shortly

379
00:34:52,603 --> 00:34:57,945
after, Gwen was recruited to join other spider-powered
heroes from across the multiverse to band together

380
00:34:57,965 --> 00:35:02,808
to defeat a vampiric race of beings known as
the Inheritors who were intent on consuming

381
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:07,778
those representing the Spider Totem in order
to prevent their prophesied destruction. She

382
00:35:07,818 --> 00:35:12,803
enjoyed seeing Peter Parker alive and well fighting
as Spider-Man in multiple universes, as well

383
00:35:12,823 --> 00:35:17,827
as getting to know fellow Spider-Heroes Jessica
Drew and Miles Morales, both of whom you can

384
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:23,113
learn more about in our Queen Bee vs Spider-Woman
and Batwing vs Spider-Man duels, respectively.

385
00:35:23,633 --> 00:35:27,577
After their battle, Gwen ended up returning
to her universe and made up with her father.

386
00:35:27,957 --> 00:35:32,281
When the Marvel multiverse collapsed in on itself
in a series of universe-ending incursions,

387
00:35:32,962 --> 00:35:38,065
villain Doctor Doom used the usurped power of
the all-powerful beings known as the Beyonders

388
00:35:38,445 --> 00:35:44,289
to save everything by fashioning a Patrick planet
of all universes called Battleworld. You can

389
00:35:44,329 --> 00:35:49,313
learn more about this in our Doctor Doom duel
against Superman. Finding herself in the domain

390
00:35:49,473 --> 00:35:54,476
of Arachnia, Gwen teamed up with other Spider
heroes such as Spider-Man Noir, Spider-Ham,

391
00:35:54,677 --> 00:35:59,600
and Spider-Man India to form a team called the
Web Warriors who together defeated the Sinister

392
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:05,683
Six and Mayor Norman Osborn. Gwen and the team
would go on to travel across the then restored

393
00:36:05,723 --> 00:36:11,726
multiverse to defend the Web of Life and Destiny,
which was a construct of fate previously overseen

394
00:36:11,846 --> 00:36:17,228
by the mysterious Madame Web that was the source
of her precognition and the source of the Spider-Sense

395
00:36:17,248 --> 00:36:23,591
powers shared by Spider-Heroes. For a brief
period, Gwen stayed in Earth-616 to visit Jessica

396
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:28,493
Drew, where she learned more about the mainstream
Marvel universes Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker.

397
00:36:29,014 --> 00:36:33,617
Returning to her home timeline, Gwen discovered
that her former friend Harry Osborn had gone

398
00:36:33,717 --> 00:36:38,361
mad with guilt that he couldn't prevent the
death of Peter Parker and had sworn vengeance

399
00:36:38,461 --> 00:36:43,666
on Spider-Woman. He took a modified version
of Peter's lizard formula and transformed into

400
00:36:43,686 --> 00:36:49,511
the Green Goblin, fighting and unmasking Spider-Woman.
When it was revealed that his enemy was also

401
00:36:49,551 --> 00:36:54,462
his former friend Gwen, the formula caused him
to lose control. With an assist by Captain

402
00:36:54,482 --> 00:36:59,226
America, Gwen was able to administer a serum
suppressant and the Green Goblin was defeated.

403
00:36:59,646 --> 00:37:05,510
However, shortly after, Gwen lost her own powers
after receiving a similar suppressant. Meanwhile,

404
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:11,434
at OzCorp, a scientist named Elsa Brock combined
the company's spider research with her work

405
00:37:11,494 --> 00:37:17,098
on an alien parasite and Peter Parker's formula
to inadvertently create the Venom symbiote,

406
00:37:17,238 --> 00:37:22,490
which ended up bonding with Gwen, transforming
her into Gwenem and restoring her powers. You

407
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:27,473
can learn more about Klintar symbiotes in our
Clayface vs Venom and Lobo vs Carnage dual

408
00:37:27,493 --> 00:37:32,577
episodes. The symbiote had a vicious hold on
Gwen that compelled her to unleash her inner

409
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:37,861
anger on her enemies and even allies. Fearful
of her own actions, she surrendered herself

410
00:37:37,901 --> 00:37:41,784
to the international law enforcement agency
known as SHIELD where she was imprisoned for

411
00:37:41,824 --> 00:37:47,448
a time. Discovering how to control the symbiote,
Gwen rejoined the Web Warriors and renamed

412
00:37:47,488 --> 00:37:54,139
herself forming a slight romantic relationship
with fellow Spider-Hero Miles Morales. Looking

413
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:59,560
to learn more about the symbiote, but unable
to find Dr. Elsa Brock, Gwen traveled to Earth-616

414
00:38:00,401 --> 00:38:05,402
to have it studied by the mainstream Spider-Man.
She ended up staying on Earth-616, where she

415
00:38:05,442 --> 00:38:11,304
pursued a degree at Empire State University.
And that's her backstory. Powers-wise, Spider-Gwen

416
00:38:11,344 --> 00:38:15,405
has Spider-based abilities granted to her by
the genetically altered Spider that bit her,

417
00:38:15,805 --> 00:38:20,494
and later, the genetically altered symbiote.
With these enhancements, she has increased

418
00:38:20,634 --> 00:38:26,556
speed, agility, durability, and strength, able
to lift up to 10 tons. She can stick to any

419
00:38:26,616 --> 00:38:31,598
surface, and can fire symbiote-generated webbing
to ensnare enemies and swing from buildings.

420
00:38:32,058 --> 00:38:37,079
The symbiote also lets her camouflage her appearance,
hence the name Ghost Spider, grants her a healing

421
00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:42,061
factor, and she can generate small symbiotic
offshoots that resemble spiders that she can

422
00:38:42,201 --> 00:38:47,575
use to scout environments. In addition, Ghost
Spider has a precognitive spider sense that

423
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:52,876
warns her of oncoming danger and wears a pendant
that allows her to travel the multiverse. She's

424
00:38:52,916 --> 00:38:58,558
a reasonable detective having learned investigation
tips from her father and is a talented musician

425
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:04,400
and former ballerina. Because she is the host
of a modified Klyntar symbiote, she is weak

426
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,981
to extreme heat and sonic based attacks. Wait,
who says you gotta go with this Venom version

427
00:39:10,021 --> 00:39:15,663
of the character? That is the existing and long-standing
version of the character. Is this the version

428
00:39:15,683 --> 00:39:20,724
with like the teeth all over the hood? That
was her outfit when she first got the Venom

429
00:39:20,744 --> 00:39:25,986
symbiote. Yes. But ever since she started going
by Ghost Spider, she has gone with her traditional

430
00:39:26,106 --> 00:39:31,688
Spider-Woman outfit. OK, interesting. Didn't
I realize that she had a symbiote that kind

431
00:39:31,728 --> 00:39:35,849
of changes things? We'll see how this goes.
Yeah, I mean, it's a nice way to differentiate

432
00:39:35,889 --> 00:39:41,217
her from Spider-Man, you know. Miles Morales
has his bioelectricity and his ability to turn

433
00:39:41,257 --> 00:39:47,143
invisible. Gwen has her symbiote powers. Like,
her universe's version of the Klyntar are basically

434
00:39:47,444 --> 00:39:53,350
alien spiders, and her suit is basically comprised
of those small spiders. Interesting. Yeah,

435
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:57,754
she calls them gummy spiders, and she uses them
to gather intel. It's pretty cool stuff. She

436
00:39:57,834 --> 00:40:00,737
uses the symbiote in a way that, like, none
of the other symbiotes have used it.

437
00:40:07,726 --> 00:40:12,349
But now that we've got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

438
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:18,453
of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not this speculation,

439
00:40:18,673 --> 00:40:24,597
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could
play out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?

440
00:40:25,438 --> 00:40:29,441
Well, I should say there are no rules, other
than the characters have no prior knowledge

441
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:33,864
of the other going into the fight. All they
are aware of starting out is that the other

442
00:40:33,884 --> 00:40:38,955
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.
For the speculation, the contestants will begin

443
00:40:38,995 --> 00:40:44,059
approximately 50 meters apart in a non-descript
environment that will have no bearing on the

444
00:40:44,099 --> 00:40:49,443
match itself, as no environmental statistics
are considered in my simulations. The contestants

445
00:40:49,483 --> 00:40:54,927
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright
then let's get into it. Rocket and Spider Gwen

446
00:40:54,987 --> 00:40:59,330
meet on the battlefield. Who goes first? I'm
gonna say Spider Gwen starts this match off

447
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:05,338
because like, Rocket can't do shit anyway without
having absorbed any kinetic energy. No, no,

448
00:41:05,558 --> 00:41:10,482
rocket's starting off this match with a sizable
amount of kinetic energy already stored up.

449
00:41:10,602 --> 00:41:18,348
Nice try. But Spider Gwen's gonna go first anyway.
She's gonna leap into the air and she shoots

450
00:41:18,448 --> 00:41:23,792
a pair of web strands on each side of rocket.
And she's gonna use them like a slingshot to

451
00:41:23,812 --> 00:41:28,756
just fling herself right into rocket with a
flying kick. But it's like a graceful ballerina

452
00:41:28,816 --> 00:41:33,514
flying kick. Okay, so. Spider Gwen, you know,
she's probably strong enough to knock Rocket

453
00:41:33,554 --> 00:41:38,316
back with an attack like that, but it's not
going to hurt her because, you know, the energy

454
00:41:38,336 --> 00:41:42,717
from the attack just gets absorbed into Rockets
and nourish her field, which she's going to

455
00:41:42,837 --> 00:41:48,958
use to bounce back and rocket herself right
into Spider Gwen, delivering a kinetic energy

456
00:41:48,998 --> 00:41:54,360
punch that's just going to send Gwen flying.
But you forgot, my friend, that Spidey sense

457
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:59,501
is a thing. Oh, my God, that Spider Gwen has.
So she's going to dodge this oncoming attack

458
00:41:59,581 --> 00:42:04,685
from Rocket. with some like mid-air splits type
stuff. And she's gonna shoot a web line that

459
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:09,629
sticks to Rocket and Rocket gets redirected
from the web line and gets slammed right into

460
00:42:09,649 --> 00:42:15,974
the ground. Would Rocket's field block the webbing?
I mean, even if it did, it would still stick

461
00:42:15,994 --> 00:42:20,178
to the field. No, it doesn't work like that.
I'm guessing like the webbing probably doesn't

462
00:42:20,218 --> 00:42:24,821
hold much kinetic energy actually, because it's
not like when they stick to people, they impact

463
00:42:24,861 --> 00:42:31,038
the people. So sure, let's say the webs get
through Rocket's field, when she's slammed

464
00:42:31,078 --> 00:42:35,682
into the ground, like again, it's not going
to hurt Rocket. She's just going to absorb

465
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:42,166
the force of the ground hitting her and gain
more energy. But the impact of the ground against

466
00:42:42,206 --> 00:42:47,190
her inertia field does break some stones loose
from the ground, which Rocket is just going

467
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:53,255
to pick up and hurl at Gwen like bullets. Spider
Gwen's just going to like bullet time dodge

468
00:42:53,295 --> 00:42:58,550
that shit, you know, like Beatrix type stuff.
OK, we'll dodge this. Rocket, she's gonna fire

469
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:03,233
off a focused beam of kinetic energy like a
laser, which is, you know, a lot faster than

470
00:43:03,273 --> 00:43:09,936
bullets. So Gwen for sure gets tagged and knocks
to the ground. Okay, uh, I mean, but Gwen's

471
00:43:09,976 --> 00:43:15,640
durable, you know, she'll take this kinetic
force blast, like a champ, and she gets knocked

472
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:20,142
down, she'll just perform this like backward
somersault into like a back handspring and

473
00:43:20,342 --> 00:43:25,905
she's back on her feet. No biggie. But then,
using her symbiote, she's gonna camouflage

474
00:43:25,925 --> 00:43:30,780
herself. to blend into the environment that
they're in, so Rocket can no longer see her.

475
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:36,864
Ooh, good move. Okay, I mean, Rocket's probably
a little freaked out and looking around because

476
00:43:36,884 --> 00:43:43,288
she knows that she's vulnerable to stealth attacks,
right? So she's gonna take to the air and she's

477
00:43:43,368 --> 00:43:49,572
gonna shoot up into the sky just to keep her
distance. Oh, too late though. Suddenly Rocket

478
00:43:49,592 --> 00:43:54,643
gets yanked down as she tries to take off. and
gets pulled back toward the ground where she

479
00:43:54,723 --> 00:44:01,088
lands in this giant sticky web net that traps
her and prevents her from moving. Shit. Uh,

480
00:44:01,108 --> 00:44:05,952
we're gonna test the strength of these webs.
As soon as Rocket gets trapped, she's gonna

481
00:44:06,272 --> 00:44:12,177
blast herself sideways, like trying to pull
herself free from the webs. And as Rocket's

482
00:44:12,237 --> 00:44:18,282
trying to free herself, bam! Spider-Gwen reappears
and straight up kicks Rocket right in the face.

483
00:44:18,502 --> 00:44:23,858
And Rocket's like, out of my face! Okay, actually
that kick... just gave her the extra amount

484
00:44:23,898 --> 00:44:29,140
of energy she needed to break free of those
webs. And she's going to quickly fly at Gwen

485
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:35,783
and trap her in an inertialist field. So Gwen
is frozen there for a few seconds, just unable

486
00:44:35,823 --> 00:44:41,305
to move or dodge this kinetic punch that's so
powerful that Rocket's going to spend all of

487
00:44:41,325 --> 00:44:46,407
her stored kinetic energy to deliver it. And
this punch could like knock back Icon and destroy

488
00:44:46,427 --> 00:44:53,475
a building. So Gwen essentially explodes from
the force of it. Match over. Actually, at the

489
00:44:53,515 --> 00:44:57,858
very start of the match, you know, when Gwen
first made contact with Rocket by kicking her,

490
00:44:57,878 --> 00:45:05,305
Uh huh. At that point, Gwen actually imparted
several symbiote spiders onto Rocket that have

491
00:45:05,385 --> 00:45:10,509
been crawling over her, making their way into
Rocket's inertia belt and just gumming up that

492
00:45:10,529 --> 00:45:15,914
technology and making it useless. So when Rocket
goes in for this like powerful kinetic punch

493
00:45:15,974 --> 00:45:21,138
killing blow, she's actually just powerless.
She has no more power. Doesn't work. And then

494
00:45:21,298 --> 00:45:26,401
at that point, Spider Gwen is freed from her
inertialist field and lays an everloving beat

495
00:45:26,421 --> 00:45:33,845
down on Rocket. And that is how this match is
won. Actually, I don't know, Spider Gwen gets

496
00:45:33,905 --> 00:45:39,488
punched before the spiders ever make it to her
belt. So, yeah, that's what actually happens.

497
00:45:39,848 --> 00:45:45,651
But yeah, we'll leave the match here. Either
Rocket delivers this explosive kinetic punch

498
00:45:45,691 --> 00:45:52,812
that just vaporizes Spider Gwen or Spider Gwen
managed to get these gummy spiders onto Rocket

499
00:45:52,872 --> 00:45:57,836
early in the match that gum up her alien technology
belt, rendering her powerless and defenseless

500
00:45:57,936 --> 00:46:02,681
against Spider-Gwen's fatal barrage of attacks.
To find out which of these scenarios happens,

501
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:06,765
let's plug in the stats for these characters,
run the simulations, and come back with a winner.

502
00:46:07,285 --> 00:46:15,633
AJ9K, hit it! Inputting data. Running calculations.
Processing results. Simulations complete. Alright,

503
00:46:15,693 --> 00:46:20,803
so- These characters are actually pretty similar
in more ways than I thought. Like they both

504
00:46:20,883 --> 00:46:26,685
wear outfits that are alien in nature. They're
both highly agile. They could both trap their

505
00:46:26,725 --> 00:46:31,386
opponents. But there were a few differences.
Like we said, Rocket is actually faster than

506
00:46:31,446 --> 00:46:36,367
Spider Gwynn. Right. And more evasive as well,
considering she's constantly wearing essentially

507
00:46:36,387 --> 00:46:42,089
a force field. However, we did say Gwynn was
more durable and stronger than Rocket. Yeah,

508
00:46:42,109 --> 00:46:47,096
when it came to the physical stats. Gwen definitely
came out on top because Rocket is just a human

509
00:46:47,156 --> 00:46:52,520
after all. That said, she does pack quite a
powerful punch, capable of some pretty powerful

510
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:58,825
attacks, so we gave her the edge damage level
wise. When it came to fighting skill, intelligence,

511
00:46:58,945 --> 00:47:04,589
versatility, they basically balanced out. We
said that Rocket has a greater range, but Spider

512
00:47:04,629 --> 00:47:09,533
Gwen has greater perception due to not only
her spider sense, but also her symbiote spiders

513
00:47:09,573 --> 00:47:13,627
that can feed her intel. So taking all of this
into account, who do you think came out on

514
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:20,109
top? Joseph? I have no damn clue. This is an
interesting one. I can't really tell based

515
00:47:20,149 --> 00:47:24,131
off the stats who's going to win. I thought
this was a pretty good match. Honestly, I'm

516
00:47:24,231 --> 00:47:29,613
pulling for Spider Gwen, though, and Instagram
agrees with me. Sixty five percent of the people

517
00:47:29,633 --> 00:47:34,655
who participated in our poll picked Spider Gwen
to win this fight. Well, that's just because

518
00:47:34,715 --> 00:47:40,397
Rocket has yet to be in a film. Milestone actually
is making a few animated projects, I believe.

519
00:47:40,886 --> 00:47:46,248
So hopefully that changes soon. But let's find
out if you're right. AJ9K, the results please.

520
00:47:46,848 --> 00:47:54,551
Hey, you are, sir. All right, the winner of
the matchup between Rocket and Spider-Gwen

521
00:47:55,252 --> 00:48:06,336
is Spider-Gwen. Hell yeah. She won 58.3% of
the 1000 matches or 583 matches total, as compared

522
00:48:06,356 --> 00:48:12,535
to Rocket who won 417. All right, so what was
the stat that gave Spider-Gwen her greatest

523
00:48:12,575 --> 00:48:18,319
advantage? It was two of them. It was perception
and strength. Now, Rocket is strong when it

524
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:23,562
comes to punches, when it comes to like lifting
strength, not so much. And I mean, Spider-Sense

525
00:48:23,622 --> 00:48:28,204
is conceptually hard to overcome. I feel like
Spider-Gwen could just dodge Rocket's attacks

526
00:48:28,344 --> 00:48:32,647
all day long. I mean, it's not like Spider-Gwen
can do much to hurt Rocket either. Well, I

527
00:48:32,667 --> 00:48:37,514
mean, except for the whole stealth attack thing.
Shit. Yeah, I guess this makes sense. And it

528
00:48:37,534 --> 00:48:41,476
makes sense that Marvel would win like every
fight, right? It never makes sense to me when

529
00:48:41,516 --> 00:48:48,980
Marvel loses. Marvel is just better as you learned
here today. I didn't learn shit. That does

530
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,522
it for this duel. Let us know what you thought

538
00:49:31,315 --> 00:49:37,742
We're gonna review Madam Webb, and I don't wanna
see that crap. It looks so bad. I hope it's

539
00:49:37,802 --> 00:49:42,404
not. Yeah, I don't even have my tickets yet.
But it's probably going to be. Yeah, I don't

540
00:49:42,444 --> 00:49:46,907
even have my tickets yet. Yeah, I gotta get
my tickets, gotta go see the movie. We'll talk

541
