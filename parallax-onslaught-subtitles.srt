00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,760
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi and welcome
to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,360
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,520
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe and I'm his twin

4
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,800
brother Johnny DC. And in this episode, we're
going to find out who'd win in a fight between the

5
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:49,920
powerful psychic and emotional entities of
Parallax and Onslaught. Yeah, these are two major

6
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,720
earth-shattering villains from the 90s in the
comics, like some of the coolest villains of all

7
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:01,200
time from Marvel and DC. Yeah, really looking
forward to this one. We got to thank John Staroski

8
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:05,980
for pitching this particular matchup. He's one of
our executive producers and of course the host for

9
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:10,680
console combat. Before we get into that matchup
though, to find out who'd win mathematically,

10
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,760
we're going to go over the latest comic book movie
news to come out this past week, of which there was

11
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,300
none, but we did get really exciting Marvel vs DC
comic book news, so we're going to talk about that

12
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,180
briefly. As always, we list our segment times in
our episode description, so feel free to check out

13
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:31,120
the show notes if you want to skip ahead to a

Network this week, including Max Destruction,
which pits your favorite action heroes from film

17
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:35,060
and television against each other. This
Wednesday, hosts Scotty and Gilly are finding out

18
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:42,380
who'd win in a fight between Mewtwo from Detective
Pikachu and Shadow from Sonic the Hedgehog 3. On

19
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,280
the Senjoh World podcast, hosts Zachary Hepburn
speculates on fights between fan-favorite anime

20
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,840
and manga characters. Zach is on a brief season
break right now, but anime fans should check out

21
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:59,680
his episode archive, including his recent
Akatsuki vs Espada matchup. His next episode is

22
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:09,360
going to be Vasto Lord Ichigo from Bleach vs Six
Tail Kyuubi Naruto. I was way off on that. On the

23
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,720
console combat podcast, hosts John and Dean
simulate battles between popular video game

24
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,920
characters. In yesterday's episode, they found
out who'd win in a fight between Morgan from Dragon

25
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:24,640
Age and Yennefer from The Witcher. Visit

26
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,340
notes to listen to all of the shows in the Dynamite
Podcast Network. But with that out of the way,

27
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:37,420
quick to the no prize! A no prize is an award
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version,

28
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,360
the Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award we
post on Instagram for the person that we feel gave

29
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,840
the best answer to our question of the week. Last
week we asked the guys if you could take either the

30
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:53,720
Marvel or DC Cinematic universes and place them in
a separate film franchise, what would it be? And

31
00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:00,160
this is coming off the news of the leaked concept
art that we saw a few weeks ago for Avengers Secret

32
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:07,700
Wars, which seemed to set the film in a high fantasy
Lord of the Rings Game of Thrones-esque world

33
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,060
recreated by Dr. Doom. We got quite a number of
answers, but we're going to break down our three

34
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,500
honorable mentions before revealing this week's
no prize winner. Our first honorable mention goes

35
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:26,560
to Lee Tapscott, who said, Hi, this is Lee. I'd like
to see the MCU in the Terminator future. The movie

36
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,580
starts out as the surviving Avengers are fighting
Terminators. Skynet knows it's about to lose

37
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:39,680
because of Tony Stark. The main story of this
movie, like the original film, Skynet sends a

38
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:46,320
Terminator back to the kill a young Tony Stark. Who
will be sent back in the past to protect an

39
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:52,080
unprepared Tony as he watches his parents die from
the Terminator? Yeah, this is a great answer. I

40
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,180
would love to see the MCU set in the universe of the
Terminator franchise. Of course, I think the

41
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:03,140
Avengers vs. the Terminators would play out
probably pretty similarly as Avengers Age of

42
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:08,800
Ultron, but I would really like to see the movie
where the Avengers send someone back in time, be it

43
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:14,560
the Hulk or Captain America or Iron Man himself,
goes back to protect young Tony Stark from like a

44
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,040
T-1000 who gets sent back to kill him. Yeah, maybe
it's like the Winter Soldier and Captain America

45
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,300
sent back in time to protect young Tony from him.
That would be cool. Yeah, like somehow the

46
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,120
Terminators brainwashed Bucky or basically they
just turned him into a full on cyborg or something

47
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,260
like that, sending him back in time. That's a
pretty good concept. I like it. Great answer, Lee.

48
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:39,900
Our next honorable mention goes to Travis
Herndon. Who said? What's up, Dine Medus? Travis

49
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:45,680
here, shout out to my evil twin. So my answer had to
be the MCU with the old Toho Godzilla franchise

50
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,340
movies. Like, I'm managing the Avengers and
Godzilla teaming up against Thanos and King

51
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:58,500
Ghidorah and other aliens and stuff, or them
fighting Ultron controlling like a whole army of

52
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:05,000
mecha-gazillas. Just seeing like an old school
type movie universe combined with this New Age

53
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,360
superhero stuff would be sick. That would be sick.
Yeah, this has been done in the comics, or actually

54
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,700
it's going on right now in the comic books, where
they're doing a Marvel vs. Godzilla crossover

55
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:21,080
similarly to what they did with DC last year. But
would I want to see that in a movie format? Hell

56
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,600
yeah, I would. Hell yeah. Yeah, the stuff that
Warner Brothers and Legendary have been doing

57
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,200
with Godzilla lately has been pretty awesome. The
monsterverse as a cinematic universe is

58
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,520
incredible. Well, Travis was also referring to
the old Toho films, you know, that would be cool

59
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:43,240
too. That's true. Honestly, Godzilla minus one
and Shin Godzilla are probably better than what

60
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,040
Warner Brothers and Legendary are doing with the
monsterverse. I just feel like because the

61
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:52,600
monsterverse is Hollywood, you would have an
easier time of getting that made. And there's a lot

62
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,960
of established characters there already,
because like you could have King Kong show up as

63
00:06:55,960 --> 00:07:02,400
well. Great answer, Travis. Our next honorable
mention goes to Matt from Texas. Who said? Hey

64
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,060
guys, it's Matt from Texas. I would like to see the
MCU merged with the Jurassic Park franchise.

65
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,160
Maybe they can think they're going to the Savage
Land, but these dinosaurs are going to be way

66
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:19,020
worse. The DCU, I would like to see merged with the
Alien and Predator franchise. Get Batman vs.

67
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:25,740
Predator, see if the Alien blood could harm
Superman. That's going to be freaking awesome.

68
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,460
Yeah, I think the Marvel Universe meets Jurassic
Park movie would play out kind of similarly to

69
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:36,400
Godzilla. Godzilla is kind of dinosaur like it
would be really cool to see though. And of course,

70
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,740
the Savage Land exists in the comic book. So we've
seen these characters interact with dinosaurs

71
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:45,780
and the source material. But we've also seen like
Batman go up against Predator and the source

72
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:51,580
material as well during those like Dark Horse DC
comic crossovers. Oh yeah, Batman vs. Predator

73
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:57,260
was pretty damn good. Not going to lie. And so with
Superman vs. Aliens, that was cool. Get Alien, get

74
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:03,800
Predator, get Superman and Batman all in one film.
Make it like a sci-fi horror superhero fight for

75
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:10,840
survival. I think that'd be really fun to watch.
It'll be the first trillion dollar film. So great

76
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,360
answer, Matt. We want to give a quick shout out to
Colby Hentges who said he wants Marvel or DC to show

77
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,940
up in 80s hijinks films like Johnny Hughes films. I
feel like we kind of got that vibe in the recent

78
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,760
Spider-Man Home trilogy because the vibe of those
films was heavily influenced by 80s high school

79
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:32,760
films. Daniel Alonso said DC should appear in
their own DC cinematic universe because they're

80
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,400
having trouble getting one started, which I
thought was a really good burn. Dishonorable

81
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:42,500
mention, John Serozky said he would like to see the
Thunderbolts or the Suicide Squad crossover with

82
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:49,720
the hateful eight. Quentin Tarantino movie,
which was basically a bunch of outlaws in a powder

83
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,700
keg environment where they're snowed in in this
cabin altogether. I think that'd be pretty fun as

84
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,740
well. And then the Kamacho twins from the Max
Destruction podcast said DC and Marvel should

85
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:06,120
cross over with each other's cinematic
universes. That's the best answer. It's

86
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:11,000
definitely the definitive answer, but probably
not right now because I'm not sure what DC universe

87
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:18,320
would cross over. Because the DC EU is dead and the
new DC EU has yet to begin. So I just couldn't

88
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,460
picture it as things stand right now. But the
winner of this week's snow prize is Mason

89
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:32,400
Thompson. Who said? Hey, it's Mason. I would have
to have the boys or invincible because I'd kind of

90
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:39,580
like to see how the picture perfect superheroes
interact with the corrupted. More in like the

91
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:46,740
boys, but kind of how like everything goes perfect
in those universes and then like invincible and

92
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,000
the boys, everything's kind of like a little bit
corrupted. I don't know. I just like to see like the

93
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,340
dynamics between the heroes. I know one thing for
certain. No matter who shows up in the boys

94
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:03,340
universe, homelanders get in the Zaskik. Yeah, I
agree 100%. And I haven't even seen the show and I

95
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:09,260
agree. I haven't seen it either. Actually, every
time an acquaintance or someone finds out that I do

96
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:13,900
superhero podcasts, they ask me, have you seen the
boys? And I don't know why because it's neither

97
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:19,260
Marvel nor DC and I think people just get confused.
But no, I haven't seen the boys largely because I

98
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:24,960
watch so much superhero television from Marvel
and DC that I just don't have time to watch the

99
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:30,680
Amazon Prime show. But I'm interested in it. You
know, I like Garth Ennis's writing him and Mark

100
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:36,760
Millar and like Warren Ellis. They do a great job of
taking these tropes from Marvel and DC and really

101
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,160
deconstructing the superhero genre. I'm not the
biggest fan of that type of work, but I really liked

102
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,500
Invincible. Invincible was a great show. Yeah, I
mean, I see Invincible and the boys as sort of a

103
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:55,560
parody of sorts of the Justice League. Like even
wanted was a parody of the Legion of Doom because

104
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:02,260
the DC heroes and villains are so iconic. It's kind
of easier to lampoon and spoof those characters.

105
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,360
So that kind of turns me off and that's probably one
of the reasons why I haven't checked out these

106
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,560
shows too thoroughly. I did watch a majority of
Invincible season one. I just haven't finished it

107
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,960
yet. I thought that was good. But again, I'm Johnny
DC for a reason. The DC characters to me are more

108
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,200
interesting. Robert Kirkman had Invincible show
up in a Marvel team up issue. I remember I actually

109
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,640
really liked it. It was funny because he was like
making fun of all the Marvel characters names. He

110
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,180
was like, OK, so you're Spider-Man. If that's how
you guys are naming people around here, I'm

111
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:35,640
guessing your flag, man. It was hilarious. Nice.
Great answer, Mason Thompson. You win this week's

112
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,560
No Prize. If you the listener want to shout out
winning your own No Prize, stay tuned to later on

113
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:44,280
this episode when we'll be asking another
question of the week. But now that that's done, on

114
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:57,080
to the news. OK, a couple of weeks ago at Comics Pro,
which is a comic book retail summit in Glendale,

115
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:03,980
California, the two heads of Marvel and DC
publishing, namely C.B. Sibulski for Marvel and

116
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:09,820
Marie Jevins for DC, were on stage talking about
the comic book industry and they began joking

117
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:15,600
about how they should do another comic's
crossover. And the audience just roared. It looks

118
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,600
like they're going to do it. They're saying
they're going to release it this year. We don't

119
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,920
know anything about this crossover, except that
it's going to be two one-shot comics tentatively

120
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:32,060
titled Marvel slash DC and DC slash Marvel. Yeah,
we've had previous major crossovers between

121
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:37,880
Marvel and DC in the comic books. You know, back in
the mid 90s and 96, they came out with DC versus

122
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:44,500
Marvel. And that was a big event. And then in the
early 2000s, we had JLA slash Avengers. And I was a

123
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:49,340
big fan of both events. I really liked the JLA
Avengers crossover. Yeah, that was done by George

124
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:55,360
Perez and Kurt Busick, an iconic phenomenal team
who knocked it out of the park with that mini

125
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,640
series. But of course, there have been other
one-shot comics to feature Marvel and DC

126
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:06,620
crossovers like the very first one, Superman and
Spider-Man. There's been a Punisher in Batman,

127
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:11,420
Batman and Captain America. There was Superman,
Silver Surfer. And of course, all of these were

128
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:18,820
collected last year into graphic novel omnibuses
when focusing on the 90s crossover and one

129
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:24,600
focusing on the one-shots. For some reason, they
didn't include the Avengers JLA crossover. Not

130
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,940
sure why. But essentially, these omnibuses were
the catalyst for this upcoming crossover that

131
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:35,500
they were talking about at Comics Pro. They don't
know what characters are going to be featured and

132
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:40,880
who's going to be writing and drawing the
one-shots. But I am so excited that they're even

133
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,160
joining forces because it's been a long time since
they've done that. Yeah, almost 20 years now. I

134
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,160
think Marvel and DC should cross over at least once
a decade. At least. And to me, I feel like if a lot of

135
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,360
people jump on board this, there's a stronger
likelihood for the cinematic universes to cross

136
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:04,320
over as well. Particularly with James Gunn at the
helm of DC Studios considering he's worked for

137
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,260
Marvel in the past. That would be awesome. Maybe
we'll even get a Marvel vs DC video game. Which is,

138
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:15,140
you know, like the end all be all, I feel like. The
dream. The dream! We'll see what happens. We'll

139
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:19,760
keep you guys updated on this particular
crossover event in the comic books so that we can

140
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,240
all just jump on it when it gets released. But
speaking of DC and Marvel Comics Crossovers, that

141
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:36,620
brings us to our question of the week. What is your
favorite Marvel and DC Comics crossover and why?

142
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,740
Yeah, we've mentioned quite a few of them during
this segment. If you guys haven't read any of them,

143

all the news for this episode, so let's go ahead and

149
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:21,040
move on to our main event where we find out who would
win in a fight between the all-powerful entities

150
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:43,860
of Parallax and Onslaught. Alright, Parallax vs.
Onslaught. Both of these characters were really

151
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,920
big in the 90s, so they've made subsequent
appearances in the comic book since then. But

152
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,600
basically they were known for their corrupting
influence over major, beloved comic book heroes.

153
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:59,080
In the case of Parallax, he heavily corrupted the
character of Hal Jordan, the Green Lantern, and

154
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:04,100
then on the Marvel side, Onslaught corrupted
Professor X. Yeah, of course Parallax was the

155
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,760
primary villain in the Green Lantern film
starring Ryan Reynolds, but we're not going to

156
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:12,920
hold that against him because the character
really wasn't done justice in the way he has been

157
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:18,780
done in the comics. Yeah, as far as I know, the comic
book version of Parallax looks kind of like a big

158
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:25,240
yellow lobster kind of. I would say cockroach.
Okay, but in the movie he was definitely like a big

159
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:31,020
watery shit with a face. Yeah, like a turd
sandwich. Yeah. Whereas Onslaught, you know, he

160
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:35,940
doesn't really have a form. He has an energy form
when you remove his armor, but he's basically just

161
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:42,280
this psychic entity and he's never been in the
movies. They kind of did allude to him, I think, at

162
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:49,200
the end of X-Men 97 season one, but we'll see if he
manifests in season two. I have no idea how this

163
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:55,040
matchup is going to go down because I don't know
much about the entity of Parallax, but I gotta say

164
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,980
if he's a giant cockroach, he's nowhere near as
badass as Onslaught and he's probably going to

165
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,180
lose. Oh, you think, huh? Yeah, cockroaches were
meant to be squished. Well, I mean, the cockroach

166
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:10,599
form is just an energy form. Parallax and the other
emotional entities typically possess beings. So

167
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:15,780
I was thinking for this matchup, he was going to
have a host body. Could be Hell Jordan, could be

168
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:20,859
Kyleraynor, could be any Green Lantern, really.
Okay. Oh, has he possessed Kyleraynor in the past,

169
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:25,220
too? Yes, yeah. Well, I'm sure we'll learn all
about that as we get into the character's

170
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:30,060
breakdowns. But first to explain the methodology
behind our duels, let's go to our sentient dual

171
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:35,860
simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K tell our
listeners how you go about determining a winner in

172
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:41,220
our dual matchups. Yes, of course, sir. The way I
determine a winner between the contestants is by

173
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,280
running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations using the
character's statistics. A Monte Carlo

174
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:51,220
simulation is a probabilistic model used to
determine outcomes through random sampling. In

175
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:56,360
this case, I randomize the statistics along a
normal distribution as a way to simulate the many

176
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,300
variables that can occur during battle. The stat
parameters are based on the official Marvel power

177
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:06,580
grid from which the DC characters' statistics are
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are

178
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:12,120
included such as range, damage potential,
versatility and perception in order to create a

179
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,080
more detailed and accurate simulation. The
results of the 1000 simulations provide a

180
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,020
percentage of wins for each character. The
contestant with the higher percentage is

181
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:25,860
declared the victor as they have a higher
probability to win any given battle. In an

182
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:31,260
equitable pairing, neither character should win
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have

183
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:36,120
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat
Superman, so the confidence rate of my method

184
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:40,180
falls in line with the precedents that have been
established in the source material. My

185
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:44,660
mathematical simulations are without
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole

186
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:51,000
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K!

187
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,200
Before we run the simulations though, we'd like to
break down each character's histories and

188
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,460
abilities before improvising a scenario on how we
imagine one of the 1000 simulations would play out

189
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:04,400
beat for beat. And I believe it's my turn to go first
with the Marvel character for this episode, so let

190
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,700
me go ahead and tell you guys all about...
Onslaught. The psionic entity known as Onslaught

191
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:15,600
was created during a climactic battle between the
X-Men and Magneto's Acolytes. During the fight,

192
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:21,640
Magneto used his powers to rip the adamantium from
Wolverine's skeleton, an act so brutal that it

193
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:27,640
left Wolverine severely injured, exhausting his
healing factor. Enraged by the attack, Professor

194
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:33,160
Charles Xavier retaliated by using his
telepathic powers to shut down Magneto's mind,

195
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:39,620
rendering him catatonic, an act with unforeseen
consequences. During this psionic contact,

196
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:45,020
Magneto's anger, grief, and thirst for vengeance
penetrated Xavier's subconscious, mingling

197
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:50,560
with Xavier's own long suppressed negative
emotions. This fusion of consciousness gave rise

198
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:55,820
to a new sentience, Onslaught, an entity that
initially laid dormant deep within Xavier's

199
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:00,040
psyche. You can learn more about Professor X and
Magneto in their respective dual episodes

200
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:05,660
against the Chief and Sinestro. As Onslaught
remained hidden, he subtly influenced Xavier's

201
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:10,840
thoughts and emotions, catalyzed by Xavier's
growing frustration with humanity's fear and

202
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:16,600
hostility toward mutants. The deaths of mutants
from the Legacy Virus, his inability to reform

203
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,560
dangerous individuals like Sabertooth, and the
overall rising anti-mutant hysteria all

204
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:27,020
contributed to Xavier's increasing doubts about
his dream of peaceful coexistence. The final

205
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:31,620
breaking point came when a young mutant was killed
near the grounds of the Xavier Institute for

206
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:36,700
Higher Learning. At that moment, Onslaught
awakened, beginning to exert control over

207
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:42,900
Xavier's mind and actions. One of Onslaught's
earliest manipulations was targeting Jane Gray.

208
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,040
He lured her to the astral plane, revealing
long-buried secrets about Xavier's past,

209
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,060
including the suppression of her telepathic
powers when she first became his student.

210
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:57,140
Onslaught hoped that this revelation would
shatter her faith in Xavier's ideology. Jane

211
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:01,640
resisted Onslaught's influence, though,
rejecting his offer to join his cause. In

212
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:07,220
response, Onslaught branded his name into her
mind before returning her to the real world. You

213
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:12,400
can learn more about Jane Gray in our Raven vs.
Phoenix episode. Onslaught also attempted to

214
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,320
recruit Xavier's stepbrother, Juggernaut.
Seeking to use Juggernaut's immense power for his

215
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:23,140
own ends, Onslaught approached him in Vancouver,
Canada, offering him a place in his crusade. When

216
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,960
Juggernaut refused, Onslaught lashed out,
blocking his memory of their encounter and

217
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,660
magnetically flinging him across the continent
to New Jersey. Juggernaut, dazed and unable to

218
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:38,700
recall what happened, managed to utter only one
word upon being discovered by the X-Men,

219
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:43,660
Onslaught. You can learn more about Juggernaut
and his duel against Atrocitus. As Onslaught's

220
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:47,700
influence grew, he infiltrated a
government-sanctioned sentinel base, where he

221
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,640
downloaded schematics and reprogrammed the
mutant hunting machines to serve him.

222
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:57,300
Onslaught's plans escalated further when he
encountered Nate Gray, the telepathic and

223
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:02,640
telekinetic mutant known as X-Men. During the
astral encounter, Nate inadvertently pulled

224
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,820
Onslaught's consciousness into the physical
world, allowing him to manifest as an independent

225
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:13,880
entity for the first time. Onslaught revealed
himself to the X-Men, declaring his aim to reshape

226
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:20,240
the world by creating a new order, one where
mutants ruled supreme. However, unlike Magneto,

227
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,080
Onslaught did not merely wish for mutant
superiority, he intended to force all of humanity

228
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:30,900
into a collective intelligence. To achieve this,
he set his sights on Franklin Richards, the son of

229
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:36,180
Mr. Fantastic, an invisible woman whose vast
reality-warping powers could make Onslaught's

230
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:42,180
vision a reality. Onslaught created a childlike
psionic projection of a young boy named Charlie to

231
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:47,360
befriend Franklin and lure him into his grasp. In
addition to capturing Franklin, Onslaught

232
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,720
abducted Nate Gray, further augmenting his own
immense psionic power. With these two young

233
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,400
mutants under his control, Onslaught turned his
attention to New York City. He set his

234
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:02,620
reprogrammed sentinels to seize control of
Manhattan, forming a barrier around the island,

235
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:07,280
isolating it from the rest of the world.
Establishing a citadel in Central Park,

236
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,900
Onslaught prepared for the final phase of his
plan. The X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and the

237
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:16,800
Avengers all converged to stop Onslaught. During
their initial confrontation, the heroes managed

238
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,800
to sever the link between Onslaught and Xavier,
hoping that this would weaken the entity.

239
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:26,080
However, instead of diminishing Onslaught's
power, the act allowed him to evolve further,

240
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,140
becoming a being of pure psionic energy. Now fully
independent, Onslaught unleashed an

241
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:36,400
electromagnetic pulse that crippled electronic
systems across the city, plunging Manhattan into

242
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,400
chaos. You can learn more about the X-Men,
Avengers, and Fantastic Four, and their

243
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,380
respective duels against the Titans, Justice
League, and Justice Society. Determined to end

244
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:50,060
humanity, Onslaught used Franklin Richards'
abilities to create a second sun in Earth's

245
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:55,120
atmosphere, threatening to incinerate the
planet. To stop him, Jean Gray suppressed Bruce

246
00:23:55,120 --> 00:24:01,140
Banner's rational mind, allowing the Hulk's full
rage to take over. In a mindless fury, the Hulk

247
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:06,060
launched a brutal assault on Onslaught, tearing
through his armor. However, this inadvertently

248
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:11,300
made Onslaught even more dangerous, as his
psionic energy form was now uncontained and

249
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:17,460
immune to physical attacks. In a desperate final
gambit, Thor flew into Onslaught's energy mass,

250
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:21,980
attempting to disrupt him from within. Realizing
that Onslaught needed a physical anchor to be

251
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:27,580
destroyed, the non-mute members of the Avengers
and the Fantastic Four sacrificed themselves by

252
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:33,100
merging into his energy form. With Onslaught now
bound to something tangible, the remaining

253
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:38,180
heroes struck their final blow, seemingly
destroying him. Although it was believed that

254
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:43,180
these heroes had perished, Franklin Richards
subconsciously created a pocket universe

255
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:47,850
Transporting them to an alternate reality known
as Counter-Earth. They remained there for some

256
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:52,710
time before eventually returning to the primary
Marvel universe. Though Onslaught was thought to

257
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:57,810
be eradicated, remnants of his consciousness
persisted. Years later, in the aftermath of the

258
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:02,970
Scarlet Witch's depowering of most of Earth's
mutants, Onslaught resurfaced. Reforming from

259
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:07,770
the residual energies of Xavier and Magneto's
powers, he set his sights on Franklin Richards

260
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:13,330
once more. Onslaught manipulated the human torch
and Mr. Fantastic into attacking Franklin, but

261
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:18,170
the boy managed to escape into the recreated
Counter-Earth. Onslaught followed him where he

262
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:24,010
battled the heroes of that world. Ultimately,
Ricky Barnes, the Bucky of Counter-Earth,

263
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:29,070
sacrificed herself to banish Onslaught into an
alternate dimension known as the Negative Zone,

264
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:33,730
which you can learn more about in our Mongol vs.
Annihilus episode. Despite being trapped,

265
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:38,650
Onslaught eventually found a way to escape. He
possessed Ricky Barnes' form using her as a vessel

266
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:44,030
to return to Earth. However, Ricky resisted his
influence and in a final act of defiance, had

267
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:49,250
herself killed to ensure that Onslaught could not
return. Later, a new version of Onslaught known as

268
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:55,070
Red Onslaught emerged when the Red Skull grafted a
portion of Xavier's brain onto his own, granting

269
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:59,710
him powerful telepathic abilities. This new
incarnation of Onslaught spread hate and chaos

270
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:04,830
across the world, manipulating heroes and
villains alike. He was eventually defeated when

271
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:09,930
Scarlet Witch and Dr. Doom performed a magic spell
that temporarily inverted the morality of

272
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:14,330
everyone affected. Most recently, when the
Earth's mutants created an independent island

273
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:19,110
nation for themselves on Krakowa, Onslaught
returned once again as part of a plot by the

274
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:24,930
anti-mute organization Orcus. They implanted a
fragment of Onslaught's essence into the mind of a

275
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:30,450
mutant named Lost, allowing him to infiltrate
Krakowa undetected. Under the guise of a psychic

276
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:36,130
entity called Patchwork Man, Onslaught preyed on
the negative emotions of Krakowa mutants, subtly

277
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:40,630
influencing them toward destruction. He was
eventually discovered by Xavier, who believed

278
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:46,530
this Patchwork entity to be a manifestation of one
of his son, Legion's personalities. However,

279
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:51,710
Legion revealed it was actually Onslaught who had
returned. You can learn more about Legion in his

280
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:56,690
duel against Crazy Jane. Onslaught eventually
possessed most of the mutants on the Krakowa

281
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:01,430
island, planning to have everyone kill each other
without the benefit of the mutant resurrection

282
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:06,370
process, which you can learn more about in our
Danny the Street vs Krakowa duel episode.

283
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:10,950
Nightcrawler managed to free everyone by
teleporting them into a pocket universe inside of

284
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:15,950
Legion's mind, and together, the mutant
collective united in communion to embrace

285
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:20,010
Onslaught instead of fighting him. Their
combined will weakened Onslaught to the point

286
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:25,090
where Nightcrawler crushed him, seemingly
ending his reign of terror for good. Powers-wise,

287
00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:30,270
Onslaught as a psychic entity possesses the
combined powers of his creators, Professor X and

288
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:35,250
Magneto. This means that he has vast telepathic
abilities which grant him mind reading, mind

289
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:40,890
control, mind erasure, mind transference,
thought casting, illusion casting, psychic

290
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:46,890
cloaking, psychic shielding, psychic pain
induction, and psychic astral projection, all on

291
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:51,830
a global scale. Onslaught can also control the
fundamental horses of electromagnetism, which

292
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:56,810
grants him complete molecular control of metals
at any scale, from manipulating iron and

293
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:02,730
hemoglobin to moving mountains. He can also fly,
create impenetrable electromagnetic energy

294
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:08,810
shields, and emit electromagnetic blasts and
pulses at the level of a nuclear bomb. In a

295
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:13,990
combination of these powers, Onslaught also
possesses telekinesis, allowing him to move or

296
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:19,510
destroy matter with his mind, from small objects
to entire city blocks. His telekinesis can

297
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:24,650
teleport and can be used with such acuity as to
create holographic illusions by manipulating

298
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:30,630
dust particles and water vapor to refract light
waves. Physically, Onslaught has vast strength

299
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:36,570
and durability able to lift in excess of 100 tons on
his own. He can psychically absorb mutants in

300
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:41,190
order to gain their abilities as he did with
Franklin Richards and Nate Gray, but he won't be

301
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:46,610
wielding those additional powers in this match.
Finally, with the combined expertise, training,

302
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:51,090
and strategic thinking of Professor X and
Magneto, Onslaught is supremely intelligent

303
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:58,750
with some combat experience. Interesting. This
almost feels like it's going to be a beefed up

304
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:05,550
version of Sinestro vs. Magneto and Atrocitus vs.
Juggernaut. Oh, for sure. Yeah, but that makes me

305
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:11,610
think that Parallax's abilities are to create
constructs like a Green Lantern or a Red Lantern.

306
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:18,490
He can do that and a whole lot more. Let me get into
his backstory. No, Parallax was a primordial

307
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:24,570
entity that came into existence with the dawn of
sentient life in the universe. In the spectrum of

308
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:31,390
emotional energy that emerged, Parallax was the
embodiment of fear, yellow, and color, a

309
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:36,870
parasitic force that thrived by instilling
terror in its victims and feeding on the emotions

310
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:43,190
of those it infected. As it traveled from world to
world, it consumed entire civilizations,

311
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:48,330
driving them into madness and self-destruction
through paranoia and terror. Billions of years

312
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:54,230
ago, the Guardians of the Universe from the planet
Owa recognized the danger posed by Parallax and

313
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:59,710
sought to contain it. They imprisoned the entity
within the Green Lantern Central Power Battery on

314
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:06,210
Owa, sealing it away with the green energy of will.
To prevent others from learning of Parallax's

315
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:11,870
existence, the Owens concealed the truth,
allowing the legend of the yellow impurity within

316
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:17,290
the battery to persist. This impurity limited the
Green Lantern's ability to affect anything

317
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:22,510
yellow and ensured only that those who could
overcome great fear could wield a Green Lantern

318
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:27,270
Ring effectively. For centuries, Parallax
remained contained within the Green Lantern

319
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:32,890
Central Power Battery, but its influence subtly
seeped into the minds of the Green Lantern Core.

320
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:37,490
When the renegade Green Lantern Sinestro was
imprisoned within the battery, his cordian

321
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:43,090
yellow power ring unknowingly drew upon
Parallax's energy, awakening the entity from

322
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:49,610
dormancy. You can learn more about Sinestro in his
duel against Magneto. Over time, Parallax's

323
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:54,190
influence began affecting Hal Jordan,
recognizing him as one of the greatest Green

324
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:59,990
Lanterns of all time. Without Hal's knowledge,
the entity slowly planted seeds of fear and doubt

325
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:05,870
within him, causing minor but noticeable changes
in his psyche. You can learn more about Hal Jordan,

326
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:11,430
of course, in our Green Lantern vs. Nova duel
episode. Parallax's influence on Hal became more

327
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:17,130
pronounced after the destruction of Coast City at
the hands of Mongol and the Cyborg Superman.

328
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:22,850
Overcome with grief and desperation, Jordan
sought to use his ring to restore the city, but when

329
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:28,530
the Owens refused his request, his emotional
state deteriorated further. Secumbing to

330
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:33,610
Parallax's control, Jordan turned against the
Green Lantern Core, attacking Oa and

331
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:38,850
slaughtering the Lanterns who stood in his way.
Upon entering the central power battery and

332
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:45,530
absorbing all of its energy, Hal fully merged with
Parallax in the process. Now wielding

333
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:52,550
unimaginable power, Hal cast aside his identity
as a Green Lantern and took on the name of Parallax,

334
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:58,310
seeking to reshape reality itself. With the full
power of Parallax, Jordan attempted to reshape

335
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:03,510
time and recreate the universe to his own liking in
order to undo the chaos and destruction that

336
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:08,970
plagued existence. After teaming up with the
villain Extant, who shared similar goals, their

337
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:14,030
plan to rewrite history nearly succeeded, but
Parallax was ultimately defeated by Earth's

338
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:19,830
heroes and the timeline was restored. In the wake
of his defeat, Jordan began to fight back against

339
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:24,970
Parallax's control. When Earth's sun was
extinguished, Jordan, in an act of sheer

340
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:31,310
willpower and redemption, used his power to
reignite it, sacrificing himself in the process.

341
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:37,030
His soul, however, was not allowed to rest,
instead becoming bonded to the Spectre, the

342
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:42,510
spirit of divine vengeance that you could learn
more about in our Spectre vs Galactus episode. But

343
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:47,670
even in death, Parallax's influence lingered
with Jordan, corrupting his time as the Spectre's

344
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:53,410
host and preventing him from fully embracing the
entity's mission. Parallax remained dormant

345
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:58,830
until Kyle Reiner uncovered the truth behind the
yellow impurity in the central power battery. He

346
00:32:58,830 --> 00:33:03,950
discovered that Parallax was not merely a
weakness in the rings but a sentient entity

347
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:09,170
imprisoned within the battery for billions of
years. With this knowledge, Ganthit and the

348
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:14,490
remaining Owens worked to separate Parallax from
Hel Jordan's soul. You can learn more about Kyle

349
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:20,850
Reiner in our White Lantern vs Null dual episode.
As Parallax was exercised, Jordan was

350
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:26,450
resurrected, regaining his physical body and
status as a Green Lantern. Parallax, meanwhile,

351
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:32,070
was re-emprisoned within the central power
battery. Sinestro, having formed his own army of

352
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:37,630
fear-wielding lanterns known as the Sinestro
Core, sought to use Parallax as a weapon against

353
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:43,390
the Green Lanterns. He freed Parallax from its
prison and bonded it to Kyle Reiner, forcing

354
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:49,390
Reiner to become its host. Under Parallax's
control, Reiner led an assault on Owa, spreading

355
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:55,450
fear across the universe. Hel Jordan and the other
lanterns managed to free Reiner and Parallax was

356
00:33:55,450 --> 00:34:01,750
recaptured. This time, to prevent its escape, the
Owens split the entity into four parts and

357
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:07,190
imprisoned each portion within the personal
power batteries of Hel Jordan, Kyle Reiner, John

358
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:12,489
Stewart, and Guy Gardner. During the rise of the
Black Lantern Core, Parallax was once again

359
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:17,870
unleashed when Hel Jordan voluntarily allowed it
to possess him in order to battle the Undead

360
00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:23,889
Spectre, who had been corrupted by a Black Lantern
Ring. With Parallax's power, Jordan was able to

361
00:34:23,889 --> 00:34:29,190
free the Spectre and push back the Black Lantern
forces before expelling the entity once more.

362
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:34,530
Parallax was later captured by Krona, the rogue
guardian of the universe who sought to use

363
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:40,350
Parallax and the other emotional entities to
exert control over the Green Lantern Core. Krona

364
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:45,409
placed Parallax back into the central power
battery, reinstating the yellow impurity and

365
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:50,590
corrupting nearly every Green Lantern in the
universe. Jordan and his allies, however,

366
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:56,670
resisted its influence using the rings of other
Lantern Cores to combat Krona's forces. In the

367
00:34:56,670 --> 00:35:02,130
final battle, Parallax was removed from the
central power battery and Krona was defeated.

368
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:07,850
Eventually, Sinestro, seeking ultimate power,
allowed Parallax to possess him, though he was

369
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:14,130
able to maintain control over its influence. With
Parallax's power, Sinestro became one of the most

370
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:19,910
formidable beings in the universe, enabling him
to kill the Guardians of Oa. When the other

371
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:24,870
entities of the emotional spectrum were drawn
back to the Source, the primordial origin of all

372
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:30,210
energy, to restore the emotional spectrum when it
was thrown into disarray, Parallax was the only

373
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:36,270
one who remained behind, still bound to Sinestro.
Parallax was eventually separated from Sinestro

374
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:41,630
and was greatly weakened. Struggling to regain
its strength, Parallax began abducting

375
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:47,190
children, feeding on their fears to sustain
itself. In a desperate bid for power, it possessed

376
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:52,350
the Reverse Flash, who you can learn more about in
his dual episode against King the Conqueror.

377
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:58,450
Parallax was ultimately expelled, however, and
left once again without a host. Now, powers-wise,

378
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:05,310
Parallax is an entity of pure fear energy, capable
of infecting minds and its victims and exerting

379
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:10,510
near total control over them. It possesses
individuals who experience even the slightest

380
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:15,910
fear, corrupting their thoughts and twisting
their emotions. Those under Parallax's

381
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:20,790
influence exhibit immense power, often
surpassing the capabilities of a standard

382
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:26,850
lantern. Parallax creates energy constructs
similar to a green or yellow lantern, but on a far

383
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:32,790
greater scale, often forming monstrous avatars
of fear to intimidate and attack its enemies. It

384
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:37,750
can instill terror on a planetary level and can
drive entire civilizations to

385
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:44,130
self-destruction. In its true form, Parallax has
no physical body, existing as a shapeless entity

386
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:50,050
that takes on forms designed to terrify those who
behold it. Though it is vulnerable to willpower,

387
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:55,310
it is nearly impossible to destroy. That's
Parallax. Interesting, yet the entity of

388
00:36:55,310 --> 00:37:00,990
Parallax is a little bit more abstract than the
entity of Onslaught, so I'm really curious how

389
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:06,570
this speculation is going to go down. But if we can
make a sentient street go up against a sentient

390
00:37:06,570 --> 00:38:05,710
island, we could probably do anything. So let's
give it a shot. Now that we've got their histories

391
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:11,330
and abilities out of the way, let's speculate on
how one of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The

392
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:16,110
winner is determined by simulations, not the
speculation, but it's fun to imagine how this

393
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:22,450
fight could play out. AG9K, what are the rules of
our speculation? Well, I should say there are no

394
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:27,430
rules other than the characters have no prior
knowledge of the other going into the fight. All

395
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:32,530
they are aware of starting out is that the other
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.

396
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:37,750
For the speculation, the contestants will begin
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript

397
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:42,830
environment that will have no bearing on the match
itself, as no environmental statistics are

398
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:47,970
considered in my simulations. The contestants
must earn victory on their own merit. All right,

399
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:53,650
then let's get into it. Parallax and Onslaught
meet on the battlefield. Who goes first? I'm going

400
00:38:53,650 --> 00:39:00,950
to say Parallax goes first by, you know, of course,
probing the fears of Onslaught. That's stupid

401
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:07,250
because Onslaught is a manifestation of negative
psychic energy, like he has no fears. I don't even

402
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:15,310
think he's literally capable of fear. I think any
sentient mind has at least a fear of dying. So, you

403
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:21,010
know, Parallax, he's going to create a yellow
energy construct of this giant moonsized skull

404
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:26,350
that's going to crash onto Onslaught like an
asteroid and just demolish him. Onslaught's

405
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:30,790
going to be terrified of that. No, he's not. All
Onslaught is going to do is going to look up at this

406
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:35,690
moonsized skull and he's going to stretch out his
hand and be like, behold, my mighty hand. And it's

407
00:39:35,690 --> 00:39:42,910
going to send out this electromagnetic shockwave
that's so powerful that it rips into this asteroid

408
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:48,790
and just like crumble it into boulders, like
thousands of boulders that are going to rain down

409
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:54,190
all around Onslaught. But he's going to be okay
because he has his energy shield up. But like the

410
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:58,910
planet they're fighting on is probably
completely devastated and they're probably just

411
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:04,130
fighting now on like this demolished asteroid
belt in the middle of space. But that is when

412
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:12,050
Onslaught is going to probe the mind of Parallax's
host and learn exactly what this entity is. Okay,

413
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:16,770
yeah, sure. You know, Onslaught, he's going to get
a glimpse of Parallax's true like dragon

414
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:23,870
insectoid form, which is scary as fuck. And while
Onslaught is the slightest bit momentarily

415
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:30,070
distracted and jarred by this reveal, Parallax is
going to spew from his mouth like dozens of

416
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:35,090
tentacles with razor sharp claws in place of
suction cups. And they're going to wrap around

417
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:41,770
Onslaught and just rip his armor off. Okay, we'll
say that these tentacles remove a portion of

418
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:46,050
Onslaught's armor. But all that's going to do is
make Onslaught stronger because as he becomes

419
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:51,410
less contained, he grows more powerful, you know,
he's going to grow in size so large that he breaks

420
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:57,510
free of these tentacles. And he's going to snatch
up Parallax's hosts and hold him in the palm of his

421
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:02,990
hand and just crush him into dust. And when he opens
his hand, that's going to reveal Parallax's true

422
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:09,830
demon form. And he's going to telepathically pull
this entity into the astral plane. So now, both

423
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:16,130
Onslaught and Parallax are psychic entities
battling it out in a realm where anything goes now

424
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:22,110
basically. Well, wait, so Onslaught's willingly
going to allow the universal embodiment of fear

425
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:28,870
onto a plane where Parallax doesn't need a host. So
he's like unbound to be his most pure night

426
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:38,430
marriage self. I will allow this. I will allow
this. So right away on the astral plane, like this

427
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:46,510
putrid yellow sky is going to emerge and suddenly
these two bright yellow terrifying eyes open in

428
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:53,870
the sky looking down and piercing Onslaught with a
gaze that would drive mortal minds insane. And

429
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:58,750
it's going to shatter Onslaught's mind. Okay, you
know what? I'm starting to think that maybe taking

430
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:04,430
Parallax to the astral plane was not my best play.
I'm going to admit that. Except Onslaught's no

431
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:11,550
mere mortal mind. Okay. In fact, he brought
Parallax to the astral plane for a reason. And that

432
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:17,770
is because he absorbs mental energy. So like these
yellow eyes feed into Onslaught, which is going to

433
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:24,470
make Onslaught grow larger than the sky. You know,
his form abstractly like surpasses all horizons

434
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:29,170
and all dimensions on the astral plane until he
like actually embodies the astral plane because

435
00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:36,990
he's so powerful now and he consumes Parallax into
himself taking on his power. And now Onslaught

436
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:44,650
becomes more frightening and powerful than both
Parallax and Onslaught combined. Onslaught. I

437
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:53,030
was thinking more like Paronslunks. I don't know.
Slunks. Okay. I mean, none of this actually

438
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:59,150
happens. You know why? Because bringing Parallax
onto the astral plane gives Parallax access to

439
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:05,090
Onslaught's powerful mind. And that's going to
allow him to extend his fear influence beyond the

440
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:11,870
planetary level to the universal. And Parallax is
going to draw upon the emotional turmoil to infect

441
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:18,830
Onslaught's mind like a parasite, making him
think he's one. But really Parallax is in control.

442
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:24,850
No, Onslaught's in control. Sure. Yeah. That's
exactly what I want you to think. If someone like

443
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:31,150
Sinestro can still be in control while possessed
by Parallax, then Onslaught sure as hell can. Oh,

444
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:36,130
you think so, huh? Yeah, that's fine. Meanwhile,
Parallax uses Onslaught's body to take over the

445
00:43:36,130 --> 00:43:42,230
universe and win this match. No, you mean
Onslaught uses Parallax's power to take over the

446
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:49,710
universe and win this match? Oh, sure. Yeah.
Definitely not the other way around. Wink. The

447
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:54,630
listeners don't know, but I'm winking. Let's go
ahead and see which of these results happens by

448
00:43:54,630 --> 00:43:59,150
inputting the stats and running the simulations.
It sounds like either way, Onslaught is absorbing

449
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:05,810
Parallax into himself. It's just a question of
whether Parallax is then in control or Onslaught

450
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:13,110
is then in control. Let's find out who's in control
with our simulator. 8G9K, hit it. Inputting data,

451
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:18,510
running calculations, processing results,
simulations complete. All right, guys, that was

452
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:23,330
pretty fun. Didn't quite go down like how I thought
it would be, but really, if you think about it, I

453
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:26,910
don't think he could finish any other way. Oh,
yeah, totally. It was very different from what I

454
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:32,510
thought it was going to be, but essentially, these
are two abstract energy entities. So yeah, it's

455
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:38,130
not like they're going to throw hands against each
other. I mean, Onslaught has thrown hands before,

456
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:42,950
you know, against the Avengers and the X-Men and
the Fantastic Four, but we said that both of these

457
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:48,010
guys have about the same level of strength, also
the same level of durability and also equal in

458
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:53,450
range. Although we gave Parallax the edge when it
came to movement speed, because he could traverse

459
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:59,710
the universe much easier than Onslaught can.
Yeah, for as powerful as Onslaught is outside of,

460
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:04,410
you know, being able to handle a majority of
Earth's heroes, he doesn't have any really

461
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:10,990
planetary or cosmic level of feats on the same
level as Parallax, but he's a mind reader with a

462
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:16,310
combined intellect of Professor Exo Magneto,
whereas Parallax is more of like a primordial

463
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:22,550
entity who's maybe not as evolved and usually gets
captured, you know. So we said that Onslaught has

464
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:27,530
greater intellect. Yeah, Parallax kind of seems
to drive more on instinct. He's kind of at the whim

465
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:34,910
of the host regarding his intelligence. He's less
of a mind reader and more of a fear sensor. So

466
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:40,970
Onslaught got the advantage and perception as
well. Parallax in his Green Lantern host is much

467
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:46,210
more versatile than Onslaught as well. And we also
gave him the edge when it came to damage level.

468
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:51,630
Yeah, I mean, for as strong as Onslaught is, he
hasn't destroyed a planet like Parallax has.

469
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:58,810
Right, which makes me really surprised at our
Instagram poll results, considering that 53% of

470
00:45:58,810 --> 00:46:04,890
our poll takers chose Onslaught for the win. Like,
do you guys know how powerful Parallax is? The guy

471
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:10,630
literally almost rewrote all of reality in the
universe. Our Instagram poll takers are pretty

472
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:14,910
keen, though. It's not like Onslaught hasn't
worked reality before, you know, using the powers

473
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:20,870
of Franklin Richards, of course, but, you know,
he's still done it. Let's find out who won. AJ9K,

474
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:28,610
the results, please. Hey, you are, sir. All right,
the winner in the duel matchup between Parallax

475
00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:40,110
and Onslaught is Parallax. Hell yeah! Hell yeah!
How did this like little worm guy beat one of the

476
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:46,730
biggest badasses that Marble has to offer?
Parallax is a universal embodiment of fear, and

477
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:54,130
Onslaught is just like the embodiment of shared
tantrum. How much did Parallax win by? Out of the

478
00:46:54,130 --> 00:47:04,430
1000 matches, Parallax won 524 of them compared to
Onslaught's 476 wins. So Parallax wins 52.4% of

479
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:09,910
the time. I'm not gonna lie, I actually thought the
percentage was gonna be much higher for Parallax

480
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:15,100
than that. Well, what kind of saved Onslaught was
his intellect and perception. Basically, his

481
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:20,890
ability to telepathically read and control minds
made sure he didn't lose too bad here. Parallax may

482
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:24,730
win a majority of the matches in a fight against
Onslaught, but there's one thing that he can never

483
00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:29,650
take away from Onslaught, and that is the cool
factor. Marble just says that cool factor that DC

484
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:35,750
cannot hope to touch, and so I feel like Marble fans
can still take away that consolation. Plus, who

485
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:42,510
thought Parallax was a good name? Like, that's a
stupid name. I will cede that Onslaught has the

486
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:47,130
much cooler name. I think DC was just trying to go
for something that sounded like parasite, but

487
00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:51,430
didn't want to use parasite because that was
already taken. That makes sense, actually, I can

488
00:47:51,430 --> 00:48:28,110
see that. But that does it for this duel, guys. A.J.
and I.K. help close us out. Our next episode is

489
00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:33,410
going to be another team duel episode, where in
honor of Women's History Month, we're going to pit

490
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:39,630
the female teams against each other of Birds of
Prey and A-Force. Yes, it's a surprise team duel

491
00:48:39,630 --> 00:48:44,610
episode. Actually, we're planning on surprising
you guys with a new team duel episode every month

492
00:48:44,610 --> 00:48:50,410
this year. So look forward to that. Well, didn't
you just ruin the surprise by saying that?

493
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:56,130
Surprise! But that does it for this episode. We
want to give a big thanks to our executive

494
00:48:56,130 --> 00:49:01,350
producers, John Staroski, Zachary Hepburn,
Miggy Mathen-Gian, Brandon Esregard, Nathaniel

Joseph Kirsting, Josh Leiner, Mike Williams, and

497
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:18,350

possible. And we'll talk to you guys next week. Up,

498
00:49:18,350 --> 00:49:24,930
up and away, true believers! The best amalgam of
parallax and onslaught would be Papa's X-Lacks,

499
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:24,930
obviously.
