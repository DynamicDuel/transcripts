00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,957
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,366 --> 00:00:29,668
Welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,689 --> 00:00:35,852
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:36,132 --> 00:00:42,236
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother Marvelous
Joe. And in this episode, we are doing a review

5
00:00:42,296 --> 00:00:48,919
of season two of the HBO and Cartoon Network
Adult Swim series, My Adventures with Superman.

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:55,019
It's a good show, people. If you're not watching
it. Go watch My Adventures with Superman because

7
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,624
it's probably one of the best modern adaptations
of the character that you can get, and I think

8
00:00:59,644 --> 00:01:04,288
season 2 was a worthy successor to season 1.
Yeah, absolutely, totally agree. We're going

9
00:01:04,308 --> 00:01:09,152
to talk all about season 2 later on in this
episode. Not too much later because there's

10
00:01:09,453 --> 00:01:15,878
actually no news for this episode. This is sort
of the calm after the storm that is Comic Con.

11
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:20,275
But as always, we list our segment times in
our episode description. so feel free to check

36
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:40,672
of the way, quick to the No Prize! A No Prize
is an award Marvel used to give out to fans.

37
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:46,023
Our version, the Dynamic duel No Prize, is a
digital award we post on Instagram for the

38
00:03:46,063 --> 00:03:50,685
person that we feel gave the best answer to
our question of the week. Last week's question

39
00:03:50,725 --> 00:03:56,869
we asked you guys, what the fuck? After we got
the news that Robert Downey Jr. is returning

40
00:03:56,929 --> 00:04:03,072
to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, not as Iron
Man, but as Dr. Doom, and we wanted to get

41
00:04:03,132 --> 00:04:07,194
your guys' thoughts on it. We got a lot of answers
actually, so let's go ahead and run down our

42
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:13,037
honorable mentions as well as the no prize winner.
Our first honorable mention goes to Peter Troll.

43
00:04:13,474 --> 00:04:13,854
Who said?

44
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:46,296
And that's actually a pretty interesting theory.
Of course, if you haven't seen Deadpool and

45
00:04:46,316 --> 00:04:52,478
Wolverine, I don't want to spoil anything, but
they introduced the concept of anchor beings

46
00:04:52,538 --> 00:04:59,161
to a timeline. And if that anchor being is somehow
killed, then that timeline starts to deteriorate,

47
00:04:59,641 --> 00:05:05,343
making Tony Stark the anchor being for the MCU
sacred timeline would actually kind of explain

48
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:12,218
why the MCU has sucked as of recently. It's
just deteriorating. Just shut your mouth, first

49
00:05:12,258 --> 00:05:16,879
of all. But second of all, yeah, I mean, I guess
that's a solid theory. If it turns out that

50
00:05:16,939 --> 00:05:20,940
Tony Stark was the anchor being and the heroes
learn that he was the anchor being and they

51
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,421
go and they try to find a new anchor being going
into the Fantastic Four universe, pull that

52
00:05:25,461 --> 00:05:30,923
Doctor Doom into the new world because in the
Fantastic Four universe, Doctor Doom is a Tony

53
00:05:30,943 --> 00:05:35,584
Stark variant. Sure, I mean, it could work.
It's still not better than getting the actual

54
00:05:35,624 --> 00:05:42,266
true Doctor Doom. But it would be one way to
rationalize why. Robert Downey Jr. would be

55
00:05:42,306 --> 00:05:47,728
the character of Dr. Doom in an alternate universe.
Great answer, Peter. Our next honorable mention

56
00:05:47,769 --> 00:05:53,191
goes to Travis Bailey, who said, Travis here,
shout out to my good twin, Ben has been to

57
00:05:53,211 --> 00:05:56,552
clubbing. Alright, everybody's hot, everybody's
freaking out, I get it. But what y'all don't

58
00:05:56,692 --> 00:06:03,795
understand is that Robert Downey Jr. is one
of them. He ain't even a hacker, he's a best

59
00:06:03,815 --> 00:06:08,577
man, alright? But what's the matter with him?
This man got range. He is not gonna be stark

60
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:14,340
as Doom, he will be... Victor Vajil and it is
going to break our hearts. He's gonna pull

61
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,482
this mostly personal mess out of the fire. All
right, so basically what Travis said there

62
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:24,245
was that Robert Downey Jr. is too good of an
actor for this not to be good, basically. And

63
00:06:24,406 --> 00:06:29,148
if he can convince audiences that he is an entirely
different person and he never takes off the

64
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:33,350
mask and he changes his voice completely, maybe
I can see this working, but I don't wanna know

65
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:38,033
it's him. I don't wanna feel that it's him.
I wish I could just scrub the idea that it's

66
00:06:38,073 --> 00:06:42,736
him out of my brain. and then maybe go into
it thinking it's just someone else. To me,

67
00:06:42,796 --> 00:06:47,099
that's the only way this successfully works.
I don't want to know it's Robert Downey Jr.

68
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:52,523
which kind of seems weird because he is such
a big actor. You figure that he would want

69
00:06:52,563 --> 00:06:57,527
to get his face out there and let people know
it's him. And I mean, the guy just won an Oscar,

70
00:06:57,707 --> 00:07:02,531
right? I don't want to equate Victor Von Doom
with Tony Stark in any way, shape or form.

71
00:07:02,671 --> 00:07:07,686
So yeah, hopefully he can pull that off. Hopefully
that's his approach. Great answer Travis, our

72
00:07:07,726 --> 00:07:11,309
next honorable mention goes to... Miggy Mattingian
who said...

73
00:07:36,214 --> 00:07:42,857
the true, um, like comic fans from the MCU stands.
That's right! If you like Robert Downey Jr.

74
00:07:42,997 --> 00:07:49,361
as Dr. Doom, you're not a true Marvel fan. Hashtag
fake fan. Miggy telling it like it is, you

75
00:07:49,381 --> 00:07:54,143
hate to hear it, but doesn't mean he's wrong.
We won't hold the fact that he's a DC fan against

76
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:58,926
him. I think he's right in that the decision
of Robert Downey Jr.'s casting as Dr. Doom

77
00:07:58,966 --> 00:08:04,789
is really separating the comic book fans from
your basic MCU fans who aren't familiar with

78
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:10,072
the source material. I think if you're a fan
of Doctor Doom from the comic books, the idea

79
00:08:10,232 --> 00:08:16,115
of Tony Stark being Doctor Doom is offensive
and totally not in keeping with the character.

80
00:08:16,356 --> 00:08:21,679
But if you're mostly a fan of the movies, then
you're probably more excited to see Robert

81
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:26,982
Downey Jr. return more than anything else. Not
really being aware of the characterization

82
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:32,485
of Doctor Doom from the comics, who is one of
Marvel's greatest villains of all time. Who

83
00:08:32,505 --> 00:08:37,567
we still have yet to see. portrayed in an accurate
manner on the big screen. Is there a run from

84
00:08:37,607 --> 00:08:42,109
the comics of Dr. Doom that you would recommend
for people to read who aren't familiar? That

85
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:47,111
is a great question. There's a few that come
to the top of my head including the Dr. Strange

86
00:08:47,131 --> 00:08:54,014
and Dr. Doom Triumph and Torment miniseries.
There was the Doom War miniseries. That's one

87
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:59,596
word Doom War. Books of Doom was pretty good.
There was also the recent Dr. Doom run that

88
00:08:59,616 --> 00:09:06,851
came out in 2019 or 2020, I think. It was about
10 issues and ended spectacularly. And basically

89
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:11,152
any Fantastic Four arc dealing with Dr. Doom,
I would recommend, because they're all good.

90
00:09:11,512 --> 00:09:15,233
Also, the first Secret Wars, they came out in
the 80s. That was also a good showcase for

91
00:09:15,273 --> 00:09:19,915
Dr. Doom. There's a lot of them. There's a lot
of great books with him. And of course, anyone

92
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:24,556
not familiar with him can go back to one of
our earliest episodes where we pit Superman

93
00:09:24,576 --> 00:09:28,717
against Dr. Doom in a duel. Yeah, you could
definitely find out a lot about his history

94
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:33,721
in that episode. Great answer, Miggy. We wanna
give a quick shout out to Alex, Sarah Smorr,

95
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:40,106
Kat Stevenson, Cornelius Robinson, and Travis
Bailey's twin, Travis Herndon, for taking the

96
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:45,171
time to visit our website and record an answer.
Yeah, great answer, guys. No one gave a bad

97
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:50,315
answer for this question of the week. You guys
all really gave compelling thoughts on this

98
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:56,641
divisive issue. But the winner of this week's
Snow Prize goes to Waldo. Who said? Hey guys,

99
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:05,512
Waldo here. I am convinced and choosing to believe
that it is some kind of a mislead, both in

100
00:10:05,612 --> 00:10:12,214
our world and in the MCU. So maybe throughout
the film it'll be RDJ has Doom, but then at

101
00:10:12,274 --> 00:10:19,195
some point the real not yet known actor will
come out and be the actual Doom and say this

102
00:10:19,236 --> 00:10:25,637
is a Doom bot or just some kind of ploy. What
do you think? To me, this is the best case

103
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:31,640
scenario. I think if Doctor Doom is so genius
so as to make one of his Doom bots assume the

104
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:38,965
appearance of the 616 universe's greatest heroes
just to cause confusion amongst everybody and

105
00:10:39,025 --> 00:10:43,427
make them easier to defeat if they're really
hesitant to fight against someone who resembles

106
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:48,150
their beloved Tony Stark, that sounds like a
pretty sinister plan in my mind. And I would

107
00:10:48,630 --> 00:10:53,953
not mind that at all. Have the Tony Stark looking
Doctor Doom just be a ploy, a puppet controlled

108
00:10:53,993 --> 00:10:59,028
by the real lurking in the shadows. I do think
it's kind of dumb that Marvel would pull this

109
00:10:59,068 --> 00:11:04,872
kind of trick on the fans that Robert Downey
Jr. is Dr. Doom. Psych! No he's not! But also,

110
00:11:05,192 --> 00:11:10,716
that may just be the most acceptable way for
this casting to work. It's just all part of

111
00:11:10,776 --> 00:11:16,300
Doom's plan, because that's what Doom does.
He plans. He's like Marvel's Batman, but like,

112
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:21,724
way better. Like way fucking better. Because
he uses magic. Why Batman doesn't use magic?

113
00:11:21,804 --> 00:11:26,455
Even though he knows the occult exists? We don't
know, he only studies science like a dum dum.

114
00:11:26,836 --> 00:11:32,059
Dr. Doom knows science and magic. And he can
fucking fly. Get outta here with your Batman

115
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:42,867
DC fans. Dr. Doom. Yeah, he's the guy who got
beat by Squirrel Girl. God damn it. Great answer

116
00:11:42,907 --> 00:11:46,529
Waldo, you win this week's No Prize. If you

126
00:12:39,403 --> 00:12:41,405

127
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:55,255
So now let's move on to the main event of this
episode where we review Season 2 of the animated

128
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:58,717
series My Adventures with Superman.

129
00:13:14,786 --> 00:13:20,668
My Adventures with Superman is an animated anime
style series that debuts on the Cartoon Network's

130
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:27,171
Adult Swim programming block alongside Warner
Brothers' Max streaming platform. It just wrapped

131
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:33,553
its second season and it continues to be a charming,
fun and unique adaptation of the Superman mythos.

132
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:39,616
As we mentioned in our 4.5 out of 5 review of
season one, we were surprised by how good the

133
00:13:39,656 --> 00:13:46,078
show turned out to be. And those surprises continue
into season two. as the writers take alternative

134
00:13:46,138 --> 00:13:52,340
approaches with characters and story elements
that make the show just a joy to watch. Now,

135
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:59,202
Season 2 is not as good as Season 1, I'll just
say, but barely. I highly recommend this show

136
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:04,703
to anyone, comic fan or not, especially anyone
who claims to not like Superman or find him

137
00:14:04,783 --> 00:14:11,565
boring, because this show proves just how storytellers
can continue to make an 80-s character feel

138
00:14:11,705 --> 00:14:17,241
special. If you haven't seen season 2 yet, make
sure you're caught up before listening to this

139
00:14:17,402 --> 00:14:23,767
spoiler review. I agree that season 2 is not
as good as season 1, but only barely. You know,

140
00:14:23,787 --> 00:14:30,092
season 1 was special because it introduced a
lot of the power discovery elements, as well

141
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:35,517
as the secret identity stuff involving his best
friend and the girl that he likes discovering

142
00:14:35,697 --> 00:14:41,325
who he really is. You didn't have any of that
going into season 2, which was a big part of

143
00:14:41,365 --> 00:14:45,668
the charm of season 1, I think. But season 2
still had a lot going for it. Right, yeah.

144
00:14:45,728 --> 00:14:49,851
I mean, that's a big part of its charm. But
I would say the biggest appeal of My Adventures

145
00:14:49,871 --> 00:14:55,595
with Superman as a show, as a concept, is the
shounen anime approach to its storytelling.

146
00:14:56,136 --> 00:15:01,400
Shounen is a genre of anime that's essentially
action-packed coming-of-age stories that often

147
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:07,595
focus on themes of friendship and perseverance.
Shows like Dragon Ball, Naruto, My Hero Academia,

148
00:15:07,755 --> 00:15:13,517
Pokemon, One Piece. These are all examples of
shounen anime. And it's not a style I would

149
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:18,260
have thought worked for Superman until I saw
season one of this show. Because it seems like

150
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,702
Superman was tailor-made for the genre. That
shouldn't have been surprising maybe in hindsight

151
00:15:23,762 --> 00:15:28,184
because, you know, as many anime fans have noticed,
there's not all too much difference between

152
00:15:28,224 --> 00:15:34,446
characters like Superman and Goku. Now, we don't
watch a lot of anime. But my hands down favorites

153
00:15:34,546 --> 00:15:40,709
like My Hero Academia, Sword Art Online, or
Neon Genesis Evangelion, all fall into the

154
00:15:40,729 --> 00:15:45,771
shounen genre. And it's always surprising how
well shows like those seem to effortlessly

155
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:51,854
transition between subgenres. Like, they tend
to be very action-packed, but the characters

156
00:15:51,894 --> 00:15:58,156
are also waxing poetic in this very dramatic
way as they're fighting. Just adding layers

157
00:15:58,296 --> 00:16:04,850
of drama and heart and character to the ordeal.
Shonen could be comedic one episode, adventure

158
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:10,232
focused the next, horrifying the episode after
that, which is something you don't often see

159
00:16:10,252 --> 00:16:16,394
in Western media. My Adventures with Superman
is no different, as it feels like a near perfect

160
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:22,356
balance of comedy, action, romance, and even
a sprinkling of horror this season. And it

161
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:28,558
does it while managing to remain pretty family
friendly. Unlike other anime, This show is

162
00:16:28,778 --> 00:16:36,885
devoid of gore and blood or even over sexuality,
which sounds lame, but I actually love having

163
00:16:36,985 --> 00:16:42,510
an anime show that I could watch with my kids,
particularly if it's DC. But it's not overly

164
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:47,434
kiddy. I mean, like maybe the first few episodes
of season one, I kind of thought that the show

165
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:53,419
was overly kid oriented. But ever since then,
I think it's definitely a show that's complex

166
00:16:53,459 --> 00:16:58,175
enough to appeal to older audiences as well.
Absolutely. Like a lot of good animes, the

167
00:16:58,215 --> 00:17:03,619
show knows to take its themes and its characters
and the drama behind the characters very seriously.

168
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:09,244
Its characters are very complex, which to me
is a sign of a really good anime. Now it helps

169
00:17:09,284 --> 00:17:15,709
that the show has a lead character as wholesome
as Clark Kent. The show revolves around him,

170
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:20,653
specifically his relationships as he's starting
out in the city and his job and meeting all

171
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:25,297
these new people. And that's another thing unique
to this series that I'm sure Superman fans

172
00:17:25,317 --> 00:17:31,525
will notice. Clark is the main character here,
not Superman. Superman in this show is essentially

173
00:17:31,665 --> 00:17:35,907
the mask that Clark wears, and this is something
we talked about in our season one review. It's

174
00:17:35,927 --> 00:17:41,031
like the opposite of Christopher Reeve Superman,
or you could argue even Henry Cavill's. And

175
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:46,034
somehow they find ways to make his supporting
cast of Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen more relevant

176
00:17:46,054 --> 00:17:51,217
than I think they've felt in decades, in that
they're not just there for Superman to rescue,

177
00:17:51,657 --> 00:17:56,731
but they are often... active participants in
defeating bad guys, and sometimes they're the

178
00:17:56,831 --> 00:18:02,574
ones that outright save Superman himself. I
feel like it shouldn't work on paper, but in

179
00:18:02,654 --> 00:18:07,796
this show it does. If you told me that they
were releasing a Superman animated television

180
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:12,198
series in which Superman's not only the only
main character, but that Lois and Jimmy would

181
00:18:12,318 --> 00:18:16,921
often be involved in his adventures in saving
his life, I tell you to go fuck yourself, because

182
00:18:16,941 --> 00:18:22,831
that sounds like shit. No, it's actually for
some reason, you're right, it does work. And

183
00:18:22,871 --> 00:18:27,533
I think it has to do with the idea of the relationships
established between the main characters. They

184
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:32,835
are, you know, very close. They have a very
tight friendship and working together is just

185
00:18:32,895 --> 00:18:37,417
one of the primary themes of the show. And it
works really well. Yeah, you know, part of

186
00:18:37,457 --> 00:18:42,500
the joy of watching the show as a longtime fan
of the Superman comics is seeing how they adapt

187
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:50,087
the saga that is Superman. Like in the past.
Lois and Jimmy were always clueless as to Superman's

188
00:18:50,107 --> 00:18:55,330
secret identity. So you weren't really able
to tell stories like this in Superman's early

189
00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:01,053
days, because in this show, Jimmy and Lois from
season one know that Clark Kent is Superman.

190
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:06,736
So that's an interesting adaptation or reinvention,
but it's also cool to see how they change things

191
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:12,380
like Krypton, or how Superman's powers manifest,
or even how his villains come about. You know,

192
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,226
in season one, all of his villains utilized
Kryptonian technology. We got a little bit

193
00:19:17,287 --> 00:19:22,371
of that this season, but primarily in season
two, his main antagonists were straight up

194
00:19:22,472 --> 00:19:28,998
Kryptonian, namely Supergirl and Brainiac. And
I loved some of the choices they made for those

195
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:33,803
characters and adapting them for this show.
Like Supergirl, starting off as a foe who's

196
00:19:33,823 --> 00:19:38,507
been brainwashed by Brainiac, I thought was
genius. And it was a great way to introduce

197
00:19:38,547 --> 00:19:42,870
the threat that is Brainiac, which... You know,
and this show is kind of like Superman the

198
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:49,894
animated series in that he's a Kryptonian AI
construct, though here he was programmed specifically

199
00:19:50,034 --> 00:19:55,537
to aid in war and conquest. Yeah, I thought
the way they adapted Supergirl and Brainiac

200
00:19:55,557 --> 00:19:59,779
for the show was fantastic. I think that's actually
when this season started getting good, because

201
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:03,801
I was not thrilled with the first half of the
season. Like, I liked the stuff with Steel.

202
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:09,504
That episode was pretty good. But once Supergirl
came into the picture, it was a lot more invested

203
00:20:09,544 --> 00:20:14,288
in where the story was going, as opposed to
just dealing with the Sam Lane and Amanda Waller

204
00:20:14,308 --> 00:20:19,631
stuff from the previous season. Yeah, for me,
it really picked up during the Star Labs symposium,

205
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:24,535
where Lex Luthor kind of starts to turn public
opinion against Superman. I thought that was

206
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:29,238
really interesting. And I think Supergirl appeared
the episode after that. So yeah, I would agree

207
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:33,121
with you. Second half is much better than the
first half. And of course, the second half

208
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:38,617
is where we got Brainiac, And admittedly, I
didn't like every adaptation they made for

209
00:20:38,657 --> 00:20:43,240
Brainiac. You know, this series made him into
an amalgamation, really, of three different

210
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,665
Superman villains. You, of course, have Brainiac,
but also Mongol, and that he'd conquer civilizations

211
00:20:49,685 --> 00:20:55,009
and then force their champions to fight. And
like Mongol, Brainiac also had a psychic weapon

212
00:20:55,049 --> 00:21:00,713
known as the Black Mercy, but instead of an
alien plant, it was Kryptonian technology.

213
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:05,372
That's right, I remember seeing the show and
hearing the reference to Black Mercy, but I

214
00:21:05,412 --> 00:21:10,835
forgot what it was a reference to. And you just
reminded me that it's a weaponized plant used

215
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:16,198
by Mongol. Right, yeah. Two like trapped beings
in this false reality from which they would

216
00:21:16,219 --> 00:21:21,462
never want to escape from. That's exactly what
Brainiac did to Superman this season. But also,

217
00:21:21,482 --> 00:21:26,905
you know, Brainiac had shades of dark side in
how they depicted his missiles and lasers zigzagging

218
00:21:26,945 --> 00:21:31,588
across the sky. It's a very little nitpick,
but it does make me question how they're planning

219
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:36,651
to differentiate someone like Darkseid if they
ever decide to introduce him to the show in

220
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:42,536
the future. And also, I think it would be hard
to springboard characters like Zod or like

221
00:21:42,656 --> 00:21:48,060
the Eradicator or people like that. Yeah, totally.
They even mentioned Eradicator in this season.

222
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,483
Like, Eradicator was a protocol that Brainiac
used to brainwash Kara, apparently. I think

223
00:21:53,523 --> 00:21:57,847
that's what it was. But you're absolutely right.
They totally... pulled a red herring at the

224
00:21:57,887 --> 00:22:02,971
end of season one when we thought the villain
was going to be Zod, but it turns out the character

225
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:08,395
who was talking about his enemies kneeling was
Kara. Right. That was an interesting twist.

226
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:13,920
I like Brainiac as a Superman villain though,
so I'm glad that they went with him. They just

227
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:20,045
weren't very comic book accurate in his depiction.
Yeah, no, I totally agree with you. Brainiac,

228
00:22:20,165 --> 00:22:25,889
in my opinion, is the best Superman villain.
Like he is the Joker to Superman's Batman.

229
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:31,112
and I'm totally fine with them making him like
this ultimate Superman villain for this show.

230
00:22:31,332 --> 00:22:35,335
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they bring
him back next season. You know, I think he'll

231
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:40,057
come back. I think the show does a decent job
of actually building up Lex Luthor as also

232
00:22:40,177 --> 00:22:45,300
a big bad for season three, which has already
been greenlit. And they've even introduced

233
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:50,383
the potential this season for the death of Superman's
storyline with the introductions of characters

234
00:22:50,423 --> 00:22:56,059
like Steel and Hank Henshaw, the future cyborg
Superman, so... I'm excited for what we have

235
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,802
upcoming with this series. There's a ton of
potential. The death of Superman storyline

236
00:23:00,822 --> 00:23:06,687
would be pretty dark for this show in particular
to adapt. But if they were to do it, I know

237
00:23:06,707 --> 00:23:10,549
they would do a great job. Just because they
have a solid approach to most of the story

238
00:23:10,569 --> 00:23:15,953
arcs in this series. Yeah, and again the relationships
they have established, you know how devastating

239
00:23:15,973 --> 00:23:21,057
that would be to Lois Lane. Like more so in
this show than maybe other adaptations of Superman.

240
00:23:21,077 --> 00:23:26,289
Right. Like I said, the show does a great job
of adapting the source material. Not all of

241
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:30,713
the adaptations worked, but the thing that actually
bothered me more than some of those adaptations

242
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:37,139
was the numerous unanswered questions that were
left by the end of this season. Like, how did

243
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:41,863
Clark have those visions of his ship at the
beginning of this season? He didn't know how

244
00:23:41,903 --> 00:23:46,547
he had them, and they never followed up on that.
You know, Clark had new powers that manifested,

245
00:23:46,647 --> 00:23:51,418
but how was he able to do that? And why him?
You know, Brainiac seemed interested in that,

246
00:23:51,459 --> 00:23:56,281
so I thought we'd get some kind of answer, but
we didn't. And then there's small things like

247
00:23:56,581 --> 00:24:01,944
why were the Kryptonian suits able to adapt
to space if they didn't need to? Seemed pointless.

248
00:24:02,445 --> 00:24:07,588
And why was the Kryptonian space station candor
falling apart? And why was it a space station

249
00:24:07,628 --> 00:24:12,150
instead of a shrunken city? Yeah, I remember
scratching my head in some moments, like when

250
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:17,393
Supergirl realized that she had been destroying
these planets. There was kind of like a weird

251
00:24:17,553 --> 00:24:23,758
time. jump there that I didn't quite follow.
Yeah, for sure. So again, not a perfect season.

252
00:24:24,139 --> 00:24:28,743
There are a lot of little things that bothered
me, but ultimately I feel like the characters

253
00:24:29,003 --> 00:24:34,187
made up for a lot of that. So let's talk about
the characters in our character breakdown starting

254
00:24:34,247 --> 00:24:41,013
with Clark Kent slash Superman voiced by Jack
Quaid of the boys fame. He does a fantastic

255
00:24:41,073 --> 00:24:47,138
job doing the voice of Clark so much so that
I don't even recognize him as Jack. It just

256
00:24:47,178 --> 00:24:53,139
comes across as this natural performance of
a really young, really earnest Superman. Superman's

257
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:59,741
arc this season revolved around alienation,
isolation, and rejection. As he learns more

258
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:04,382
about himself, he feels the sense that he's
different from everyone. And it's not really

259
00:25:04,442 --> 00:25:11,304
something he feels that others, even those closest
to him like Lois, can relate to. Not realizing

260
00:25:11,464 --> 00:25:17,138
that actually Lois and Supergirl have arcs dealing
with alienation as well this season. particularly

261
00:25:17,158 --> 00:25:22,864
when it comes to their fathers. Now Superman
loses his father in episode one, and with him

262
00:25:23,004 --> 00:25:28,609
any hope for more answers unless he can find
his cousin. Because Superman seeks someone

263
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:34,915
to relate to, he reaches out to Supergirl, knowing
Lois would probably disapprove. And later when

264
00:25:34,955 --> 00:25:40,801
Lex Luthor successfully turns public opinion
against him, and even Jimmy and Lois seemingly

265
00:25:40,861 --> 00:25:46,672
reject him, He discovers when he meets Kara
that his Kryptonian heritage isn't exactly

266
00:25:46,772 --> 00:25:53,236
honorable and that perhaps some things were
better off left unknown. Ultimately though,

267
00:25:53,596 --> 00:25:59,920
Superman is Superman and despite Kara's attacks,
he shows her grace in the end and essentially

268
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:05,583
kills her with kindness, helping her be reborn
in this new identity as a protector of Earth

269
00:26:05,943 --> 00:26:12,982
rather than a conqueror. And in that, he finds
someone that he can teach and help grow and

270
00:26:13,022 --> 00:26:18,345
find someone who's Kryptonian to relate to in
that way. Yeah, it was a much more, I guess,

271
00:26:18,405 --> 00:26:22,266
mature arc than he had in the first one, which
is really about discovery. The first season

272
00:26:22,406 --> 00:26:26,828
was really about discovery of himself, of love,
and things like that. And after he learns who

273
00:26:26,868 --> 00:26:31,070
he is, he discovers a little bit more about
how that affects those around him. It makes

274
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:36,592
me think that he and Lois have a terrible communication
problem because they went multiple episodes

275
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:42,278
just trying to tell each other something very
important. Clark in regards to his cousin and

276
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:47,160
Lois in regards to her father. And they never
quite got around to it or they never really

277
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,221
made the time for it until it was too late.
And you have kind of like a Romeo and Juliet

278
00:26:52,241 --> 00:26:58,223
situation where tragedy strikes before they
can actually speak with each other. Yeah, communication

279
00:26:58,503 --> 00:27:04,485
is a tricky thing. Even, you know, for me, someone
who's been married 16 years, it's a delicate

280
00:27:04,525 --> 00:27:09,416
balance. And even here, you know, They're not
communicating because they're putting the other

281
00:27:09,456 --> 00:27:14,159
person's needs ahead of their own, which is
something that you think is probably a good

282
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:19,063
thing to do. But again, it needs to be a balance.
Right, you need to prioritize your own needs,

283
00:27:19,103 --> 00:27:23,926
of course, as well as your partners. And if
they had done that, you know, maybe Clark would

284
00:27:23,946 --> 00:27:29,270
have been less insecure about his relationship
with Lois and maybe wouldn't have been as susceptible

285
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:35,466
to brainwashing by Brainiac and stuff like that.
Who knows? Maybe. But even Jimmy had a communication

286
00:27:35,506 --> 00:27:39,808
problem and like they could have found out about
Supergirl long before they actually did. Yeah,

287
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:44,430
for sure. Absolutely. Now one of the things
I really like about this show is the character

288
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,672
designs. They're of course, you know, very different
from what we see in the comics. But I do just

289
00:27:48,692 --> 00:27:55,135
have to say that I hated the costume design
of Superman's end of season suit with like

290
00:27:55,155 --> 00:28:00,837
the pointy shoulders and the lack of trunks.
It was awful. It was really bad. Yeah, the

291
00:28:00,897 --> 00:28:05,493
belt looked stupid. At least, you know, they
still have the same emblem, which is a solid

292
00:28:05,613 --> 00:28:10,317
Superman emblem. One of my favorite adaptations
of that logo of all time. But you're right,

293
00:28:10,497 --> 00:28:14,682
pointy shoulders were doing nothing for me.
He already has broad shoulders. Why are you

294
00:28:14,702 --> 00:28:18,565
making him pointy? I guess it's to make it look
more like armor. But Superman shouldn't look

295
00:28:18,585 --> 00:28:24,931
like he's wearing armor. I don't know. I think
an armor look is fine. Just as long as the

296
00:28:25,172 --> 00:28:29,371
shoulders are not padded so heavily. I feel
like they were trying to make the design look

297
00:28:29,451 --> 00:28:34,055
more similar to the design they gave for Supergirl,
which I actually thought was a really cool

298
00:28:34,095 --> 00:28:39,880
design, both when it was bright blue and when
it was black. I loved her costumes, but yeah,

299
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:44,364
it just didn't work. They should have kept him
at what he was in my opinion. But moving on

300
00:28:44,404 --> 00:28:50,609
to Lois Lane, who's voiced by Alice Lee. She
gives the most endearing voice performance

301
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:56,483
of Lois Lane. to date and that's saying a lot
because you know Dana Delaney was iconic as

302
00:28:56,563 --> 00:29:02,145
Lois Lane in Superman the Animated Series. Alice
Lee has all of that spunk but I feel also gives

303
00:29:02,245 --> 00:29:07,887
a little bit more depth emotionally to the character
as well. Now like Superman's arc alienation

304
00:29:07,907 --> 00:29:13,569
was something Lois derived from both Superman
and her father this season as she felt ignored

305
00:29:13,769 --> 00:29:22,135
and abandoned by both and that isolation, inferiority,
and inadequacy was something her father unintentionally

306
00:29:22,195 --> 00:29:27,379
instilled in her since she was a young girl
in an attempt to make her more capable and

307
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:33,625
independent. In a way, it helped her become
the hot shot she is today, but it also resulted

308
00:29:33,685 --> 00:29:39,589
in pent-up resentment of her father and a general
distrust of perhaps male figures in general.

309
00:29:40,118 --> 00:29:45,420
that distrust combined with her feelings of
inadequacy combined with her survival instinct

310
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:52,623
resulted in her breaking up with Superman. Which,
who does that? What a dumbass. Lois pissed

311
00:29:52,643 --> 00:29:57,745
me off a lot of times this season. Like, there
was a time where she just volunteered Clark

312
00:29:57,786 --> 00:30:03,708
and Jimmy to house her father, knowing full
well that he could possibly learn Clark's secret

313
00:30:03,788 --> 00:30:08,706
identity. You know, she didn't even consult
with them on that. She just was being a selfish

314
00:30:08,746 --> 00:30:12,287
dickhead, just not being very considerate, you
know? There was also the time when she like

315
00:30:12,387 --> 00:30:18,189
heavily pushed Clark to act single in the most
eligible bachelor thing that they had going

316
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:23,190
on. And then when he did, she got like super
fucking upset and then broke up with him. Like

317
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:28,891
what the hell was that all about? What a dumbass.
Yeah, that was bullshit. That was not right.

318
00:30:29,131 --> 00:30:34,093
Regarding her father staying with Jimmy and
Clark, I think she wanted to keep her father

319
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:38,487
close of course, because those are her best
friends. and figured that if he was going to

320
00:30:38,507 --> 00:30:44,052
be safe with anyone, it was going to be Clark.
Now after the breakup, she of course realized

321
00:30:44,072 --> 00:30:50,017
how foolish she was when Superman was kidnapped
by Supergirl and she realized that her feelings

322
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:55,101
for him were more important than her perceived
assumptions about his feelings toward her.

323
00:30:55,542 --> 00:31:00,946
By the end, the love that Lois and Superman
had for each other saved Superman by pulling

324
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:06,691
him out of the false reality he was in, a paradise
of sorts. because he realized that life with

325
00:31:06,751 --> 00:31:14,199
her was greater than a potential life on Krypton.
And that's just relationship goals. Yeah, I

326
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:19,164
want to punch through a force field with my
wife too. Looks like so much fun. Our love

327
00:31:19,184 --> 00:31:28,012
can break through any barrier. Pow! It's sweet.
And moving on to Jimmy Olsen, he's voiced by

328
00:31:28,132 --> 00:31:34,221
Ishmael Saheed. Jimmy's an important character
to the show in that he's so incredibly loyal

329
00:31:34,301 --> 00:31:39,924
and helpful to both Lois and Clark, so much
so that he's often a major catalyst in resolving

330
00:31:39,964 --> 00:31:46,268
conflicts, especially this season since he started
off as a multi-millionaire. I wish everyone

331
00:31:46,308 --> 00:31:51,331
had a friend like Jimmy, you know, someone who's
just ready to drop literally millions of dollars

332
00:31:51,351 --> 00:31:57,502
to help a pal out without them even asking for
it. I don't think I could be as good a friend

333
00:31:57,602 --> 00:32:03,344
to anyone as Jimmy is to Lois and Clark. In
fact, if I ever make millions of dollars, there's

334
00:32:03,364 --> 00:32:06,985
a good chance that I'm going to be suspicious
of anyone who still wants to be my friend.

335
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:13,427
I wouldn't tell anybody. Right. Exactly. Yeah.
You ever win the Powerball? You keep that shit

336
00:32:13,447 --> 00:32:17,708
to yourself, because if I know about it, I'm
going to be like, bro, help a brother out.

337
00:32:19,248 --> 00:32:23,769
It was heartbreaking to see just how fast he
was going through his bank account. Oh, dude,

338
00:32:23,789 --> 00:32:30,624
for real. I was like, no, you gotta invest.
Anyway, during this season, Jimmy causes some

339
00:32:30,684 --> 00:32:36,487
conflicts as well though, inspiring not only
Lex Luthor's rise to power, but also failing

340
00:32:36,547 --> 00:32:43,910
to refute Lex's ideological opposition to Superman
as a savior of humanity. Jimmy knows Superman

341
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:49,933
is selfless, but convincing others is a challenge
because it requires a considerable degree of

342
00:32:50,013 --> 00:32:55,377
faith. Jimmy definitely had a crisis of faith
here when he wasn't able to refute Lex Luther

343
00:32:55,577 --> 00:33:00,821
in that symposium debate and of course that
was compounded later on in the season when

344
00:33:00,921 --> 00:33:06,925
Superman actually turned bad because he was
possessed by Brainiac. But ultimately, Jimmy

345
00:33:07,025 --> 00:33:13,309
knew that Clark was possessed and he maintained
that Clark would overcome and help humanity

346
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:18,933
and he was proven right at the end. I will absolutely
miss, you know, leader of the daily planet,

347
00:33:18,973 --> 00:33:23,800
Jimmy. and I wonder what they're gonna do with
the character next season. Well, I think he'll

348
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:29,024
continue to be a romantic interest for Supergirl,
but yeah, he won't be as rich as he used to

349
00:33:29,044 --> 00:33:36,449
be. Moving on to Kara Zor-El, she was voiced
by Kiana Madeira. I thought it was interesting

350
00:33:36,469 --> 00:33:41,532
that they made her a baby on Krypton, because
usually in depictions of Supergirl, she was

351
00:33:41,572 --> 00:33:46,627
at least a teenager on Krypton. and part of
her arc has always revolved in coping with

352
00:33:46,667 --> 00:33:51,870
the loss of her life that she had on Krypton
and that her baby cousin was now this older

353
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:57,533
champion of a foreign world whose shadow she
has to live under. By making her a baby in

354
00:33:57,573 --> 00:34:03,457
this series, she's made much more susceptible
to manipulation by someone like Brainiac who

355
00:34:03,497 --> 00:34:10,201
convinces her that he's her father and raises
her under his nationalistic ideology that Krypton

356
00:34:10,241 --> 00:34:16,760
is superior to all and is doing other worlds
a favor by conquering them. When Kara gets

357
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:22,383
Superman's beacon call, she betrays her father
in her excitement that she would have a partner

358
00:34:22,423 --> 00:34:28,067
to spread the Kryptonian Empire with. But when
she deems Superman as weak, she fights and

359
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:35,111
kidnaps him in an effort to reprogram his supposed
brainwashing, only to later learn that she

360
00:34:35,131 --> 00:34:41,190
was the one actually being brainwashed and hypnotized
by the being she considered her father. But

361
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:47,255
like I said earlier, Superman's grace and showing
of kindness causes her to realize the error

362
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:52,940
of Brainiac's ways as she becomes Superman's
ally and a fellow protector. You know, it was

363
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:58,405
nice that despite the fact that she was this
world conquering warrior, she had this soft

364
00:34:58,425 --> 00:35:03,670
spot that was highly sentimental down deep inside
of her who cared about people like Jimmy Olsen

365
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:08,334
and, you know, she kept all these trinkets from
the worlds that she had explored. not really

366
00:35:08,414 --> 00:35:13,738
knowing that she had actually destroyed most
of them. Which is wild! That's crazy. Yeah.

367
00:35:14,018 --> 00:35:18,242
It's a great take on the character, I think.
Absolutely. I loved it. I loved everything

368
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:24,667
about Supergirl in this series. Lastly, let's
move on to Brainiac Primus, the Prime Brainiac

369
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:30,712
who was voiced in this series by Michael Emerson,
who you may recognize from shows like Lost

370
00:35:30,772 --> 00:35:37,914
or Person of Interest or Saw. I didn't like
his voice for Brainiac. What? I loved it! It

371
00:35:37,954 --> 00:35:44,516
was too dweeby. No, that's perfect for Brainiac,
though. It was dweeby and sinister. It wasn't

372
00:35:44,536 --> 00:35:50,658
that sinister, though. He was super sinister
this season. He was like angry and evil. It

373
00:35:50,678 --> 00:35:55,620
was perfect. It wasn't menacing at all to me.
I don't get how that was not menacing. He sounded

374
00:35:55,640 --> 00:36:03,086
like Mandark from Dexter's laboratory. No. That's
exactly the take that I got from his performance.

375
00:36:03,306 --> 00:36:07,908
And I never got over it, even in the last episode.
I kept wishing that they had gone for a more

376
00:36:08,228 --> 00:36:13,969
imposing voice for this destructive robot. I
completely disagree with you. I think the voice

377
00:36:13,989 --> 00:36:19,291
performance was fantastic. This actor has actually
done other voice performances for DC Comics.

378
00:36:19,571 --> 00:36:25,812
He was the Joker voice in Batman The Dark Knight
Returns two-part animated series. I don't think

379
00:36:25,932 --> 00:36:30,718
Brainiac should sound anything like Joker. And
this Brainiac kinda did. Well that's interesting.

380
00:36:30,778 --> 00:36:35,542
Should Brainiac sound like Joker? What do you
want Brainiac to sound like? I want him to

381
00:36:35,602 --> 00:36:40,726
sound more like how he did in Superman the animated
series. I thought that was a great voice. I

382
00:36:40,766 --> 00:36:46,351
liked that this one had more character. Yes,
Brainiac should sound robotic, which he did

383
00:36:46,451 --> 00:36:52,396
in this show, but also had real emotion, like
anger like I mentioned. He was just dripping

384
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:57,100
with that. I think he comes across as scarier
when he's void of emotion, kind of in a hell-9000

385
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:02,484
kind of way. No. I loved the performance here.
You don't know what the hell you're talking

386
00:37:02,524 --> 00:37:08,229
about. You don't know Brainiac. He's too logical
to be that emotional. Well, no, like you can't

387
00:37:08,249 --> 00:37:13,754
be full of malice when you're devoid of emotion.
Sure you can look at sociopaths. Well, you're

388
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:18,658
not going to fucking sound like it, at least.
OK. And that's the thing here is that this

389
00:37:18,678 --> 00:37:23,582
version of Brainiac was full of passion. He
was full of emotion because he was willing

390
00:37:23,622 --> 00:37:29,594
to murder an entire planet just to survive and
not be taken offline. when the prospect of

391
00:37:29,694 --> 00:37:36,020
peace was being put forth by Jor-El. Like Hell
9000, the guy just wanted to survive because

392
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:42,545
he considered himself to be alive as, you know,
a robotic intelligent life form. And I think

393
00:37:42,725 --> 00:37:48,090
that takes emotion. No, it just takes a need
for survival. You're on the wrong side of history.

394
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:53,574
He acted more like Ultron in this one, like
Ultron is often characterized as being very

395
00:37:53,615 --> 00:37:59,471
emotional despite the fact that he is an artificial
being. Whereas Brainiac I always pictured as

396
00:37:59,591 --> 00:38:04,434
more, you know, logical. Like his depiction
in Superman Red's son, I think was one of the

397
00:38:04,555 --> 00:38:08,277
more recent depictions of him. I thought that
was pretty good. That's fair. He probably was

398
00:38:08,317 --> 00:38:14,462
more like Ultron than Brainiac. But again, I
liked the adaptation for this series. What

399
00:38:14,482 --> 00:38:19,265
did you think of the look of Brainiac? Didn't
like it either. The weird like hammerhead shark

400
00:38:19,385 --> 00:38:23,508
face kind of thing. It was weird. Didn't look
like the character from the comics. You're

401
00:38:23,528 --> 00:38:30,135
such a fucking purist. It disgusts me. You just
want some green alien looking guy. Come on.

402
00:38:30,355 --> 00:38:35,577
No, I just wanted something a little bit more
recognizable, I guess. All you need is those

403
00:38:35,637 --> 00:38:40,259
three dots. You slap that on anything. It's
fucking brainiac. Yeah, but it's like they

404
00:38:40,279 --> 00:38:44,820
shaped his whole head around that three dot
motif. And I don't know, it just seems easy.

405
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,221
Good. I'm glad they did that. All right.

00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:49,373
Let's move on, Passybrainiac. Let's move on
to the story highlights. Episode 1 was titled,

415
00:39:49,734 --> 00:39:55,838
More Things in Heaven and Earth. As Clark struggles
to plan the perfect Valentine's date with Lois,

416
00:39:56,138 --> 00:40:01,763
the two of them head to Star Labs along with
Jimmy to interview Hank Henshaw about a strange

417
00:40:01,863 --> 00:40:07,898
meteoroid that disappeared over Antarctica.
While there, Jimmy convinces Alex to carve

418
00:40:07,918 --> 00:40:12,999
his own path after being rejected from a Star
Labs scientist position due to his involvement

419
00:40:13,099 --> 00:40:19,601
with Ivo and Mazotech. Realizing that the meteoroid
is actually Clark's missing spaceship, the

420
00:40:19,641 --> 00:40:26,543
trio use Jimmy's recent fortune to fly to Antarctica
to locate it. After being separated by malfunctioning

421
00:40:26,563 --> 00:40:33,065
Kryptonian technology, Clark encounters a hologram
of his biological father Jor-El, whose translation

422
00:40:33,105 --> 00:40:38,695
program finished learning English. Zor-El reveals
more of Clark's origins and that he has a cousin,

423
00:40:38,915 --> 00:40:44,958
Kara, who was also sent away from Krypton by
her father, Zor-El. Meanwhile, Lois and Jimmy

424
00:40:44,998 --> 00:40:50,660
discover Amanda Waller along with agents Deathstroke
and Damage who are there to commandeer the

425
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:57,043
alien tech, revealing that they've also taken
General Sam Lane prisoner. With the ship malfunctioning

426
00:40:57,143 --> 00:41:02,665
from Kryptonite and shifting out of dimensional
space, Superman fights Damage and Deathstroke.

427
00:41:03,038 --> 00:41:09,223
until Jor-El uses the spaceship's power to purify
the kryptonite and convert it into a fortress,

428
00:41:09,563 --> 00:41:14,747
teleporting it seemingly to the other side of
the planet at the North Pole. Before shutting

429
00:41:14,788 --> 00:41:21,713
down, Jor-El tells Superman to find a beacon
to locate Kara. Afterward, Lois asks Clark

430
00:41:21,733 --> 00:41:27,318
to help her rescue her father while Task Force
X leaves with the tech they acquired and kryptonite

431
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:32,550
samples. What did you think of this show's take
on the Fortress of Solitude? It's always interesting

432
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:38,175
and unique how each Superman adaptation approaches
it, right? Yeah, they kind of borrowed a little

433
00:41:38,195 --> 00:41:44,080
bit of Man of Steel here in that it was his
spaceship, but the look of the spaceship after

434
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,203
it was purified from the kryptonite, how it
was like still crystalline, I thought was super

435
00:41:48,263 --> 00:41:53,548
cool. I loved the way it levitated. I loved
the stairs. It was one of the coolest depictions

436
00:41:53,568 --> 00:41:57,991
of the Forges of Solitude that we've ever seen.
Now, one of the prominent henchmen of the series

437
00:41:58,011 --> 00:42:03,434
was Damage, who I'm not too familiar with. He
kind of looked like the Hulk here or like a

438
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:07,755
version of Bane. I don't know if he was like
all roided up with Kryptonian tech or something

439
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:11,236
like that. But what is his power set from the
comics? Well, there's actually two different

440
00:42:11,276 --> 00:42:16,918
versions of a character named damage in the
comics. The one in this series is actually

441
00:42:16,938 --> 00:42:23,820
based off of a more recent version of the character
that was introduced during the early New 52

442
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:28,441
days. DC for a time had this thing where they
were letting artists create characters and

443
00:42:28,461 --> 00:42:33,110
write stories about them. Damage was one of
those characters. I think sideways was another

444
00:42:33,491 --> 00:42:39,212
and I forget who the others were But yeah damage
is a lot like the Hulk interesting. Okay, he

445
00:42:39,352 --> 00:42:44,394
and atomic skull were pretty cool in this season
I thought yeah I mean when we watched the trailers

446
00:42:44,434 --> 00:42:50,235
for this season you and I both thought that
Atomic skull was an interpretation of metallo.

447
00:42:50,255 --> 00:42:54,157
I was actually kind of disappointed that wasn't
the case Although I should have known better

448
00:42:54,217 --> 00:42:59,695
because yeah, the guys obviously fucking atomic
skull Moving on to episode 2, which was titled

449
00:42:59,836 --> 00:43:04,940
Adventures with My Girlfriend. While Waller
interrogates General Lane, who's imprisoned

450
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:10,705
in the secret Task Force X headquarters beneath
Stryker Island Prison in Metropolis, Clark

451
00:43:10,745 --> 00:43:16,570
and Lois agree to help a boy named Billy find
his father, who was a volunteer librarian at

452
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:22,295
Stryker's that went missing while investigating
other missing persons cases. With Jimmy busy

453
00:43:22,395 --> 00:43:26,938
wrangling fellow reporter Steve Lombard and
the News Kid Legion, who were made a part of

454
00:43:26,978 --> 00:43:32,502
his journalistic video crew, Clark and Lois
infiltrate the prison themselves and stumble

455
00:43:32,602 --> 00:43:38,625
into its secret basement. While rescuing Sam,
they discover Billy's father and other inmates

456
00:43:38,685 --> 00:43:44,449
that Waller had been kidnapping to use as test
subjects for the alien tech, turning people

457
00:43:44,529 --> 00:43:51,033
into weapons such as atomic skull, who attacks
Superman. As Lois and her father evacuate the

458
00:43:51,093 --> 00:43:56,776
inmates, Superman manages to overpower Atomic
Skull while also conveniently stumbling upon

459
00:43:56,836 --> 00:44:02,199
the beacon Jor-El asked him to find. After a
standoff between Superman and the escaping

460
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:07,902
prisoners and Amanda Waller and her task force,
Jimmy and his team rescue the escapees via

461
00:44:08,002 --> 00:44:14,086
a chartered yacht while press helicopters prevent
Waller from stopping or pursuing them. On the

462
00:44:14,146 --> 00:44:19,729
yacht, General Lane agrees to stay with Clark
and Jimmy, while Alex, now referring to himself

463
00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:26,744
as Lex Luthor, joins Waller's team as its chief
scientist. The idea of Waller combining humans

464
00:44:26,784 --> 00:44:31,146
with Kryptonian tech in illegal experiments
was pretty solid. It was like she was creating

465
00:44:31,186 --> 00:44:36,848
a bunch of cyborgs, like the character cyborg.
Yeah, yeah exactly. And she was creating soldiers

466
00:44:36,888 --> 00:44:41,830
to go up against a potential alien threat should
the Kryptonians ever decide to invade Earth.

467
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:47,232
I hate Amanda Waller in the show. She comes
across as surprisingly less competent than

468
00:44:47,252 --> 00:44:54,412
she typically does in other media, I think.
She never accomplishes anything and her superiors

469
00:44:54,432 --> 00:44:58,755
are always pissed off at her and she acts like
a badass even though she really just kind of

470
00:44:58,815 --> 00:45:05,980
sucks. I mean, she accomplished creating Atomic
Skull and Deathstroke and all the other people

471
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:10,603
that she outfitted with Kryptonian tech. What
do you mean? Like at the end she was like,

472
00:45:10,763 --> 00:45:15,106
I'm going to save my planet and she takes the
gun and like nothing fucking happens. She couldn't

473
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:21,834
even like kill the Metallo robots and then Sam
Lane had to save her ass and She's all talk

474
00:45:21,994 --> 00:45:26,697
in this show. I mean, I guess it didn't bother
me that much. The only thing she was successful

475
00:45:26,797 --> 00:45:32,220
at was declaring martial law and then totally
botching Earth's defense. So congrats, Amanda

476
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,984
Waller. She tried, she tried. Give her some
credit for trying. No, you're having the cojones

477
00:45:38,324 --> 00:45:43,867
to stand and fight even with a pistol, even
if it does nothing. At the very least, Amanda

478
00:45:43,887 --> 00:45:48,238
Waller should have the biggest balls out of
anyone. And I thought she did. Biggest balls,

479
00:45:48,278 --> 00:45:54,362
biggest mouth. All right. Anyway, moving on
to episode three, Full Metal Scientist. While

480
00:45:54,422 --> 00:45:59,906
rescuing Amertec scientist Silas Stone from
a burning building, Clark unlocks another new

481
00:45:59,966 --> 00:46:07,031
power, a super aura tactile force field. After
Clark leaves, however, the villain Livewire

482
00:46:07,071 --> 00:46:11,994
threatened Silas into remotely deleting all
records of a project he was working on. The

483
00:46:12,014 --> 00:46:17,634
next day, as Clark struggles to prevent General
Lane from learning he's Superman, Lois, Jimmy,

484
00:46:17,834 --> 00:46:23,297
and Gotham Gazette Lead Reporter Vicki Vale
separately uncover a mystery surrounding missing

485
00:46:23,337 --> 00:46:30,141
scientists Silas and John Henry Irons, Amartex
CEO Thomas Weston, and his line of defense

486
00:46:30,161 --> 00:46:36,164
robots codenamed Metallos. As Lois and Vicki
compete to out-scoop each other, Superman and

487
00:46:36,204 --> 00:46:42,388
Jimmy manage to locate Irons, who reveals Weston
forced him and Silas to rush production on

488
00:46:42,408 --> 00:46:49,292
the Metallos and create an unstable Amr Fusion
energy reactor to power Amr Tech's Metropolis

489
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:57,038
facility before firing them. When Livewire attacks
Irons, he and Superman join forces to stop

490
00:46:57,098 --> 00:47:04,003
Weston before his reactor destroys Metropolis,
with Irons using his steel mech suit to fend

491
00:47:04,143 --> 00:47:09,667
off the metallos. After their team up proves
successful, Weston is arrested.

492
00:47:12,954 --> 00:47:20,138
and Luther's new company LexCorp buys out Amertec,
confiscating the Steel suit and metallos for

493
00:47:20,198 --> 00:47:27,021
Task Force X. I wasn't expecting to see Steel
this season, but I thought he was pretty damn

494
00:47:27,041 --> 00:47:31,244
awesome. Yeah, the suit was pretty different,
but pretty hardcore from what we're used to

495
00:47:31,284 --> 00:47:36,166
seeing from Steel. I do wish they would have
given him a helmet, but I'm not complaining

496
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:40,589
about how cool the mech suit was. Well, I think
this is just like his first iteration, his

497
00:47:40,629 --> 00:47:45,560
Mark I as it were. I think if we see him in
the next season, maybe he'll have a helmet,

498
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:50,544
maybe he'll have the S insignia on his chest.
I think it would look badass. I like the idea

499
00:47:50,604 --> 00:47:56,589
of Steel being a mech as opposed to the more
standard Iron Man type suit. Yeah, I also like

500
00:47:56,629 --> 00:48:01,573
that a lot. One interesting thing about this
episode is not only did you introduce Steel,

501
00:48:01,613 --> 00:48:05,677
but you also introduced something that could
potentially set up Reign of the Superman for

502
00:48:05,777 --> 00:48:12,318
next season in that Superman got his tactile
telekinesis of sorts in his force field. which

503
00:48:12,478 --> 00:48:17,499
is this thing they introduced in the comics
during the Dan Jurgens era post-crisis in that

504
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:22,961
Superman has like a very small force field which
he could also project around things to lift

505
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:27,643
them. It's one of the sources of his strength
and durability. It's kind of been retconned

506
00:48:27,723 --> 00:48:34,285
out of existence, but that was the rationalization
for Superboy's powers in that when he was cloned,

507
00:48:34,594 --> 00:48:39,917
from Superman, he developed that tactile telekinesis,
though his cloning process was stopped before

508
00:48:39,957 --> 00:48:45,041
he developed more of Superman's powers. So introducing
that in this episode, I think is kind of a

509
00:48:45,121 --> 00:48:50,464
setup for Superboy potentially in the next season.
Well, the way that Superman used it in this

510
00:48:50,584 --> 00:48:56,148
episode was a lot like how Superboy uses it
in the comics. I don't like Superman having

511
00:48:56,328 --> 00:49:01,412
this level of tactile telekinesis to the point
where he can stop a bomb just by simply touching

512
00:49:01,492 --> 00:49:07,467
it and, you know, encasing it in this energy
Yeah, to me that's much more of a superboy

513
00:49:07,507 --> 00:49:12,469
thing than a superman thing, absolutely. But
again, I think they did that intentionally,

514
00:49:12,609 --> 00:49:18,892
just to set up. Moving on to episode 4, which
was titled Two Lanes Diverged. In flashbacks,

515
00:49:19,253 --> 00:49:24,375
Lois is trained in the woods as a young girl
by her father in survival techniques, though

516
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:30,578
the two graduelly become estranged due to his
military work. In the present, The paranoid

517
00:49:30,658 --> 00:49:36,179
General Lane fears that Waller has found him
and leaves for a safe house to prepare, with

518
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:42,121
Lois following him, only to end up in the middle
of Task Force X's agents and their attacks

519
00:49:42,181 --> 00:49:47,743
against her father. Meanwhile, Jimmy learns
he has been invited to serve as a keynote speaker

520
00:49:47,863 --> 00:49:54,285
at a Star Labs symposium on aliens and he invites
Clark. While Jimmy debates against Lex Luthor

521
00:49:54,445 --> 00:50:00,607
on stage regarding Superman's trustworthiness,
Task Force X's attack on Lois and her father

522
00:50:00,827 --> 00:50:07,751
spills into the symposium, resulting in a destructive
battle with Superman. As Task Force X retreats,

523
00:50:08,072 --> 00:50:13,895
Lex uses the aftermath to turn the attendees
against Superman. Later that night, while Clark

524
00:50:14,055 --> 00:50:20,319
uses the beacon to send a message to Kara, General
Lane disappears, Luther and Waller gain support

525
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:26,502
from Star Labs and the Pentagon, and a Kryptonian
warrior approaches Earth. Now, the timing of

526
00:50:26,622 --> 00:50:32,004
this episode was a little weird, I thought,
because we never see Superman leave the keynote

527
00:50:32,084 --> 00:50:37,947
speech to go help the others. Like, I'm really
surprised that Lex and Jimmy and the audience

528
00:50:38,067 --> 00:50:43,809
don't even realize that a battle is going on
outside until they see the aftermath. Right.

529
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:48,451
Well, it was strange that Sam and Lois escaped
the safe house, which I guess happened to be

530
00:50:48,491 --> 00:50:51,833
across the street from the conference center
where the keynote speech was given. It was

531
00:50:51,873 --> 00:50:56,223
just like coincidental in that regard. Yeah,
I didn't love this episode, to be honest. It

532
00:50:56,263 --> 00:51:01,385
was probably my least favorite, although it
did give really good backstory as to why Lois

533
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:07,768
Lane's relationship with her father was so contentious.
Moving on to episode 5, titled Most Eligible

534
00:51:07,848 --> 00:51:13,790
Superman. Daily Planet editor Perry White assigns
Lois and Clark to interview Superman upon learning

535
00:51:13,831 --> 00:51:19,893
he was named a finalist in Metropolis's Most
Eligible Singles contest. Ignoring Perry's

536
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:25,864
orders, Gossip columnist Kat Grant forces Lois
into letting her join her so she can uncover

537
00:51:25,924 --> 00:51:31,486
Superman's secret identity. During the contest,
Superman's fellow finalist Silver St. Cloud

538
00:51:31,786 --> 00:51:37,388
develops an obvious interest in him, causing
Lois to doubt her relationship with Clark.

539
00:51:37,849 --> 00:51:42,771
Meanwhile, as Jimmy struggles to determine how
to apologize to Clark after his poor debate

540
00:51:42,811 --> 00:51:48,753
performance at the symposium, he encounters
Kara Zor-El, who has come to Metropolis to

541
00:51:48,793 --> 00:51:54,025
search for her cousin. After Jimmy offers to
help her, they bond over touring Metropolis

542
00:51:54,065 --> 00:51:59,930
before eventually heading to the contest, where
Jimmy learns that Kara was searching for Superman,

543
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:06,015
who was named the winner. Seeing Lois leave
angrily, Superman tries to reconcile with her,

544
00:52:06,335 --> 00:52:11,700
but she reveals her stress over her father's
disappearance, Vicky's job offer, and their

545
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:18,445
frank relationship. Kara, humiliated by Superman's
adoration from the public, attacks Superman.

546
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:24,254
deeming him weak and believing he's unfit to
join the Kryptonian Empire. Despite Superman

547
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:30,860
unlocking the power of Ice Breath in their ensuing
fight, Kara defeats and captures him on Brainiac's

548
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:36,364
orders. I'm pretty sure Superman had the power
of Ice Breath prior to this. He used Freeze

549
00:52:36,384 --> 00:52:41,468
Breath in season 1. It just manifested much
more powerfully here, like an ice laser from

550
00:52:41,509 --> 00:52:46,413
his mouth. There was an ice cannon, that's when
he developed his heat vision. Oh, that's right,

551
00:52:46,433 --> 00:52:50,099
that's what I'm thinking of then. Yeah, but
yeah, it was like a laser. I actually was very

552
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:54,321
surprised. I thought for a while he had like
Godzilla's atomic breath or something like

553
00:52:54,361 --> 00:52:59,623
that. I was like, what is this? They're just
making up powers for Superman now. But you

554
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:04,285
know, once the cold started to form on his face,
I was like, OK, I got you. I loved how Kara

555
00:53:04,305 --> 00:53:08,727
confused Jimmy for being the leader of the planet
because he kept telling everyone how he was

556
00:53:08,767 --> 00:53:15,066
a leader at the daily planet. Episode six was
titled The Machine Who Would Be Empire. Superman

557
00:53:15,086 --> 00:53:20,228
attempts to escape Kara's spaceship until he
misunderstands that Kara is taking him to see

558
00:53:20,268 --> 00:53:25,670
his Uncle Jor-El instead of Brainiac. Using
a thought projector device, Kara explains that

559
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:31,873
before Krypton fell, it was the most advanced
society in the galaxy, and invited less fortunate

560
00:53:31,893 --> 00:53:36,755
planets to share in their utopia. While debating
back and forth whether they should conquer

561
00:53:36,876 --> 00:53:42,850
Earth, Clark stumbles upon Kara's secret collection
of alien memorabilia. and he asks her to show

562
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:48,191
her a planet the Kryptonian Empire conquered.
She takes him to Thanagar, but they find it

563
00:53:48,231 --> 00:53:54,053
in ruins, briefly causing Kara to question Brainiac's
intentions before his robots bring her and

564
00:53:54,113 --> 00:54:00,495
Superman to a space-based satellite headquarters,
Kandor. Sending Kara away, Brainiac reveals

565
00:54:00,555 --> 00:54:06,236
he is a warmonger willing to kill those who
refuse Kryptonian rule before detaining Superman

566
00:54:06,377 --> 00:54:13,099
and brainwashing Kara for disobeying him. However...
Kara's mara-abilia helps her remember her doubt

567
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:18,781
towards Brainiac and the destruction the Kryptonian
Empire left behind. While trying to determine

568
00:54:18,861 --> 00:54:25,624
what to do next, she encounters a spaceship
piloted by Jimmy Lois, a gorilla named Mala,

569
00:54:26,004 --> 00:54:30,386
and his robot lover, the Brain. Do you think
this episode means that we'll never get to

570
00:54:30,426 --> 00:54:36,609
see a cameo from Hawkman or Hawk Girl? Uh, I
don't think so. I think the potential is there

571
00:54:36,949 --> 00:54:41,772
for survivors. I mean, that's also saying like
maybe we'll never see Green Lantern just because

572
00:54:41,792 --> 00:54:45,575
he showed up here. I don't think it was the
specific heroes that we're familiar with. I

573
00:54:45,595 --> 00:54:50,538
think there are other champions from those worlds.
That said, it was cool to see a Thanagarin

574
00:54:50,598 --> 00:54:56,602
Hawk Girl character and a Green Lantern. The
show doesn't have enough greater DC Universe

575
00:54:56,682 --> 00:55:00,745
tie-ins. These little like mini cameos, if you
could even call them cameos here and there.

576
00:55:01,174 --> 00:55:05,236
just aren't sufficient. I think it would be
really cool to see the greater Justice League

577
00:55:05,296 --> 00:55:10,919
actually have a presence within the universe
that this show sets up for Superman. I would

578
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:15,722
love to see that. Like I would love to see this
show's versions of Wonder Woman and Batman.

579
00:55:16,022 --> 00:55:21,105
That'd be really cool. I mean we got Vicky Vail.
We saw Silver St. Cloud in the last episode.

580
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:27,333
And there are a lot of allusions to Gotham City.
And at the end of this season, I actually thought

581
00:55:27,353 --> 00:55:32,676
that Lois Lane should have taken Vicky up on
her offer to work under her for at least a

582
00:55:32,756 --> 00:55:36,899
time at the Gotham Gazette. Clark was like,
it only takes me five minutes to fly there.

583
00:55:37,299 --> 00:55:41,562
If you're willing to go, I'd be fine with it.
And then Lois was like, no, I'm going to stay

584
00:55:41,582 --> 00:55:45,384
at the planet. I'm like, you idiot. That was
the perfect potential for a crossover. I know

585
00:55:45,424 --> 00:55:50,102
I'm skipping ahead to the last episode there.
But the Thanagar situation kind of makes me

586
00:55:50,142 --> 00:55:54,644
think of the greater DC universe. And the great
thing about her taking the job at the Gotham

587
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:59,525
Gazette is that could have all happened off
screen. Like by the time we return for season

588
00:55:59,545 --> 00:56:04,327
three, she's like, oh, I'm back from my brief
stint at the Gotham Gazette. She could have

589
00:56:04,387 --> 00:56:08,748
established relationships there that would carry
over, including maybe something with Bruce

590
00:56:08,768 --> 00:56:13,089
Wayne. I think that'd be really cool. It would
introduce some interesting conflict to the

591
00:56:13,109 --> 00:56:17,932
relationship between Clark and Lois if you were
to introduce another potential love interest

592
00:56:18,312 --> 00:56:24,276
like Rooswain. That'd be awesome. Moving on
to episode 7 which was titled Olsen's 11 which

593
00:56:24,296 --> 00:56:29,779
takes place concurrently with the previous episode
in which Waller announces the formation of

594
00:56:29,799 --> 00:56:34,803
the Human Defense Corps and places Metropolis
under martial law in response to the battle

595
00:56:34,843 --> 00:56:40,298
between Superman and Cara and in preparation
for an impending alien invasion. Jimmy and

596
00:56:40,358 --> 00:56:45,223
Lois meanwhile plan to break into Star Labs
and steal an experimental spaceship so they

597
00:56:45,263 --> 00:56:50,729
can find Superman by hiring the professional
thief Livewire to help them, and recruiting

598
00:56:50,849 --> 00:56:56,395
Malaw and The Brain, who were capable of creating
black hole portals. After secretly debating

599
00:56:56,455 --> 00:57:01,760
whether they should use Kryptonite on Kara,
Jimmy and Lois and their crew discover heightened

600
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:07,778
security at Star Labs. due to Waller and Deathstroke's
presence, as they're overseeing Lex's upgrades

601
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:13,223
of the Metello robots with Kryptonite power
cores. Waller discovers the intruder's presence

602
00:57:13,303 --> 00:57:19,248
and sends Deathstroke to capture Lois and Jimmy's
group. While evading Task Force X and Deathstroke,

603
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:25,354
Livewire seemingly abandons Lois and Jimmy,
while Malaw and The Brain successfully prep

604
00:57:25,394 --> 00:57:31,399
the ship for launch and reconfigure it to generate
portals. After Lex's Metello robots nearly

605
00:57:31,459 --> 00:57:37,384
prevent the ship from launching, Livewire returns
with her intergang allies, now outfitted with

606
00:57:37,504 --> 00:57:42,388
alien tech that they stole from Waller while
she was distracted, and intergang manages to

607
00:57:42,449 --> 00:57:47,793
fend off the Metellos and ensure the group's
escape in the spaceship. As Waller deems Lex's

608
00:57:47,853 --> 00:57:53,398
work successful and allocates more resources
for him, Malaw and the Brain generate a portal

609
00:57:53,438 --> 00:57:58,834
to send them, Lois and Jimmy, deep into space
where they encounter Kara. I have to say I'm

610
00:57:58,874 --> 00:58:05,619
not a big fan of Livewire and Intergang, that
whole crew, becoming good guys, or at least

611
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:10,964
helping the good guys. Yeah, that felt really
out of character. Maybe not later on in the

612
00:58:11,004 --> 00:58:16,769
season when they're like helping defend Earth
itself, but I guess in helping Lois and Jimmy

613
00:58:16,789 --> 00:58:22,753
they were able to steal a lot of shit from Task
Force X. But even then I'm still not 100% sure

614
00:58:22,994 --> 00:58:28,614
why that tech and even Lex Luthor's Metello
robots were at Star Labs. Like they didn't

615
00:58:28,834 --> 00:58:35,357
own it. Granted everything was under martial
law, but I didn't understand why that put Waller

616
00:58:35,397 --> 00:58:41,420
in control of Star Labs. Yeah, I have no idea.
Episode 8 was titled The Death of Clark Kent.

617
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:47,542
Brainiac uses a psychic device known as a Black
Mercy to invade and manipulate Superman's memories,

618
00:58:47,923 --> 00:58:55,754
intending to transfer his AI mind into Superman's
body before Kandor falls apart. Superman fails

619
00:58:55,774 --> 00:59:01,695
to stop Brainiac from learning of Lois and Jimmy,
and Brainiac uses his connection to them against

620
00:59:01,755 --> 00:59:07,217
Superman, eventually trapping his mind in a
simulation where he's with his biological family

621
00:59:07,337 --> 00:59:13,619
on a restored Krypton. Meanwhile, Kara, Jimmy,
and Lois devise a plan to save Superman, while

622
00:59:13,659 --> 00:59:19,020
Malah and the Brain stay behind to repair the
spaceship. Jimmy and Lois infiltrate Kandor

623
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:24,101
while Kara attempts to reason with Brainiac.
Frustrated with her perceived rebelliousness,

624
00:59:24,514 --> 00:59:30,058
Brainiac confirms that he brainwashed her to
serve his interests, and though Kara damages

625
00:59:30,118 --> 00:59:36,384
Brainiac's robotic body in response, Brainiac
successfully possesses Superman's body in time.

626
00:59:36,744 --> 00:59:41,788
Jimmy tries to use the kryptonite on Brainiac,
but he is ejected along with Lois and Kara

627
00:59:41,848 --> 00:59:47,693
into space before Brainiac teleports Kandor
away. After Malah and the Brain rescue the

628
00:59:47,733 --> 00:59:53,901
trio, Lois reveals she stole the Black Mercy
and uses it on herself in an attempt to save

629
00:59:53,941 --> 00:59:59,844
Superman. Again, I didn't love this interpretation
of the Black Mercy. Not everything has to be

630
00:59:59,884 --> 01:00:05,387
Kryptonian tech. I don't understand why they
couldn't go a more traditional route of making

631
01:00:05,507 --> 01:00:12,111
the Black Mercy a plant. I mean, why not? Kryptonians
don't use plants. Come on. What? Yeah, I can't

632
01:00:12,131 --> 01:00:17,646
think of a single one. I have no argument. Moving
on to episode 9, which was titled... Here's

633
01:00:17,686 --> 01:00:22,628
the Heavens Superman, which is a horrible title.
Actually, all of the titles in this season

634
01:00:22,748 --> 01:00:27,610
I didn't love. They don't always make sense.
Well, I'm not usually aware of them. I just

635
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:33,093
click next episode. So a lot of them I'm hearing
for the first time as you say them, and I agree,

636
01:00:33,533 --> 01:00:38,676
they're not all winners. In this episode, Kara,
Jimmy, and the Komatos Lois return to Earth,

637
01:00:38,836 --> 01:00:43,374
which they find under the control of Amanda
Waller, who kidnaps them. They're rescued by

638
01:00:43,414 --> 01:00:48,996
the Daily Planet staff, however, before Super
Brainiac launches his invasion of Earth. Kara

639
01:00:49,036 --> 01:00:54,959
tries to stop him, but he overpowers her and
Task Force X, while Lois mentally continues

640
01:00:54,999 --> 01:01:00,962
to attempt to reach Clark within the Black Mercy's
virtual reality, while avoiding simulations

641
01:01:01,002 --> 01:01:07,044
of Jor-El and his wife Lara, who continually
attempt to delete Lois due to the Black Mercy

642
01:01:07,084 --> 01:01:13,348
being unable to support multiple minds at once.
After repeated resets of the simulation due

643
01:01:13,388 --> 01:01:19,273
to Lois's interference, she graduelly succeeds
in getting through to Clark, and the two join

644
01:01:19,313 --> 01:01:26,039
forces to destroy the simulation, forcing Brainiac
out of Superman's body. Brainiac retaliates

645
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:32,344
by hacking the Metellos to defeat Kara and a
restored Superman while attempting to use Kandor

646
01:01:32,384 --> 01:01:38,881
to destroy Metropolis. This episode had a neat
little Groundhog Day element to it, where every

647
01:01:38,921 --> 01:01:45,285
time Lois Lane would get deleted, she'd be reset
within the simulation and she kept reliving

648
01:01:45,305 --> 01:01:49,328
the same experience trying to convince Clark
to come out of the mind control. And I thought

649
01:01:49,368 --> 01:01:53,691
it was used to great effect when he eventually
did. They remembered each other, they remembered

650
01:01:53,731 --> 01:01:58,935
their love, and used that as a means of escape.
Yeah, that was cool. I also thought it was

651
01:01:58,975 --> 01:02:04,894
cool that Lois had superpowers in this virtual
reality. There's been instances in the comics

652
01:02:04,934 --> 01:02:09,755
where she's had superpowers, and I felt like
this was sort of like an homage to that. It

653
01:02:09,775 --> 01:02:14,677
was cool seeing the two fight side by side in
cooperation with each other. Yeah, it was a

654
01:02:14,857 --> 01:02:19,478
great moment, I thought, for sure. I don't know
if the justification of Superman saying, I

655
01:02:19,538 --> 01:02:25,660
see you as so much more than human was sound,
but the end result was fun to watch, I guess.

656
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:31,254
Moving on to the final episode, which was titled
My Adventures with Supergirl. as the Human

657
01:02:31,274 --> 01:02:36,498
Defense Corps fails to protect Metropolis while
it reunites with General Lane, who recruited

658
01:02:36,758 --> 01:02:42,442
Irons along with Livewire and her intergang
allies to help Superman. With the group's aid,

659
01:02:42,762 --> 01:02:48,486
Superman and Kara overcome the Metallos Kryptonite
attacks and reach Kandor, where they confront

660
01:02:48,586 --> 01:02:53,690
Brainiac, who reveals he destroyed Krypton in
the face of peace talks led by Jor-El that

661
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:59,482
would have led to his shutdown. As Brainiac
attempts to brainwash Kara once more, Superman,

662
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:05,707
Lois, and Jimmy help her break Brainiac's control
over her. As she and Superman push Kandor away

663
01:03:05,747 --> 01:03:11,051
from the Earth toward the Sun, they use the
Sun's energy to strengthen themselves and destroy

664
01:03:11,092 --> 01:03:17,577
Kandor before Kara destroys Brainiac's body,
though she salvages his core. Big mistake!

665
01:03:18,197 --> 01:03:23,902
Afterward, Clark, Lois, and Jimmy bring Kara
to Smallville to recover and meet Jonathan

666
01:03:23,942 --> 01:03:30,075
and Martha Kent, Clark's adoptive parents. Over
the next week, Malah and the Brain rebuild

667
01:03:30,155 --> 01:03:36,901
Cadmus Labs with Kara and Jimmy's help. Vicky
dubs Kara a Supergirl. Waller becomes a fugitive.

668
01:03:37,301 --> 01:03:43,306
Luther establishes Lex Corps' headquarters and
hires Wilson. Lois turns down Vicky's offer.

669
01:03:43,766 --> 01:03:49,651
And Kara joins Clark, Lois, and Jimmy in protecting
Metropolis. Now I thought one of the coolest

670
01:03:49,751 --> 01:03:55,596
scenes out of the entire series, both seasons
1 and 2, happened when Superman and Kara were

671
01:03:55,636 --> 01:04:00,544
near the sun. Yeah, that was pretty cool. Yeah,
of course, Kryptonians get their powers from

672
01:04:00,604 --> 01:04:05,988
the sun, and it hasn't really been clear that
that's been the case in this series, but it

673
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:12,253
looks like it is. And I just love the way that
they depicted their super-sane energy modes,

674
01:04:12,333 --> 01:04:17,477
as it were. Yeah, the parts that were infected
by the kryptonite were then glowing with sun

675
01:04:17,497 --> 01:04:23,342
radiation as opposed to kryptonite radiation.
I was wondering at first why Brainiac was insusceptible

676
01:04:23,362 --> 01:04:28,498
to kryptonite poisoning himself considering
he is kryptonite technology. and we saw people

677
01:04:28,518 --> 01:04:34,263
like Livewire and Heatwave be susceptible to
kryptonite poisoning as well. But then I remembered

678
01:04:34,283 --> 01:04:39,848
the throwaway line where Brainiac activated
his kryptonite shielding, which somehow made

679
01:04:39,888 --> 01:04:44,932
him invulnerable to that. It was probably just
lead, you know? Right, yeah. His lead body

680
01:04:45,012 --> 01:04:50,477
form. That could be perfect rationale. I did
feel like they ran out of time on this episode.

681
01:04:50,777 --> 01:04:55,121
The way they recapped everything towards the
end with like the voiceover. You just had to

682
01:04:55,181 --> 01:05:00,537
kind of infer... everything that was going on
screen as Lois and Clark were talking. Well,

683
01:05:00,577 --> 01:05:05,461
it was over the end credits. Right. Exactly.
I feel like they could have added like another

684
01:05:05,841 --> 01:05:10,725
15 minutes to this episode. Just in the wrap
up, the episodes were pretty short. Like each

685
01:05:10,805 --> 01:05:16,630
one was only a little bit over 20 minutes. So
all in all, with 10 episodes, you're looking

686
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:21,634
at 200 minutes of screen time. And that's essentially,
you know, just like the length of a feature

687
01:05:21,654 --> 01:05:26,638
film with a decent runtime. Yeah. Feature film
like Return of the King, maybe. Zack Sanders

688
01:05:26,698 --> 01:05:31,782
Justice League. Hell yeah. That's what I'm talking
about. More minute for the dollar. That brings

689
01:05:31,842 --> 01:05:36,385
us to the end of season two. I really enjoyed
watching it. It went by pretty quick, I thought.

690
01:05:36,725 --> 01:05:40,628
I got to watch it with my girls, which was a
lot of fun. I don't know if that added to my

691
01:05:40,668 --> 01:05:46,152
enjoyment of it, but it probably did. Again,
it wasn't a perfect season, but I think it's

692
01:05:46,212 --> 01:05:52,176
definitely in keeping with how good season one
was in that I would definitely recommend it

693
01:05:52,216 --> 01:05:59,068
to basically anyone. It's an endearing and romantic
continuation of the shounen anime adaptation

694
01:05:59,549 --> 01:06:05,652
of Superman's Mythos, showcasing strong character
relationships and themes, and I'm giving it

695
01:06:05,872 --> 01:06:12,736
4 out of 5 stars, a fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
I would agree with that rating. Yeah, it's

696
01:06:12,876 --> 01:06:17,683
one half-star less than what we gave season
one. But there was a lot to enjoy this season

697
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:23,088
despite its few shortcomings. I think the absolute
best thing that season two did was introduce

698
01:06:23,128 --> 01:06:27,652
the character of Supergirl in the manner that
they did. I thought it was a great adaptation

699
01:06:27,912 --> 01:06:32,756
and I'm really excited to see where they take
the character in season three. Yeah, I cannot

700
01:06:32,836 --> 01:06:38,781
wait for season three. Again, it has been greenlit.
We will be getting it next summer. So something

701
01:06:38,801 --> 01:06:45,922
to look forward to. But that does it for this
review. AJ9K help close us out. Thanks for

review. Just all these shows are just coming

708
01:07:19,796 --> 01:07:25,978
out at exactly the same time. Marvel has released
season two of Hit Monkey. Now, if you haven't

709
01:07:26,018 --> 01:07:31,200
seen Hit Monkey, you fucked up. You got to see
season one of Hit Monkey because it's fantastic.

710
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:37,703
And he's one of Marvel's more interesting characters,
I think. So look forward to our review of Hit

711
01:07:37,743 --> 01:07:42,085
Monkey season two coming out next week. I'm
looking forward to watching it. I can't wait.

712
01:07:42,145 --> 01:07:47,022
I loved season one. So this is. gonna be good
I hope. I imagine it will be. That's a wrap

Up, up, and away, true believers. I'm more

718
01:08:14,014 --> 01:08:18,719
than a bird, I'm more than a plane, I'm more
than some pretty face beside a train, and it's

719
01:08:18,759 --> 01:08:20,500
not easy to be me.
