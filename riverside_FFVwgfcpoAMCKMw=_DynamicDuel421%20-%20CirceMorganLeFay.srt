00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,906 --> 00:00:29,649
Welcome to the dynamic duel podcast a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,669 --> 00:00:35,714
the superiority between Marvel and DC By comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations

4
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:42,219
I'm marvelous Joe and I'm his twin brother Johnny
DC and in this episode we're gonna find out

5
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:51,345
who would win in a fight between Morgan Le Fay
and Cersei being a Greek mythological figure

6
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:56,788
and Morgan Le Fay being an Arthurian legend
character. Right, and Cersei of course is a

7
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:01,710
Wonder Woman villain. Morgan and Le Fay is I
think an Avengers villain, is that right? Well,

8
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:06,472
she's an Avengers villain, she's a Black Knight
villain, she's also a Doctor Strange villain.

9
00:01:06,812 --> 00:01:12,935
She's a general Marvel villain, and she's pretty
powerful, so I'm pretty sure that Cersei is

10
00:01:12,955 --> 00:01:19,597
going down. So what you're saying is she's like
the Marvel villain village bicycle? Sure, sure,

11
00:01:19,637 --> 00:01:24,535
whatever. I mean, if you're familiar with Arthurian
legend, you might not disagree with that statement.

12
00:01:25,076 --> 00:01:29,317
Sweet! Can't wait for this match! Before that,
we're going to get into the latest comic book

13
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:34,900
movie news of which we only have one news item
this week, and that is that Ulrich Thompson

14
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,982
is going to play Sinestro in the HBO Lantern
series. Who the hell is that guy? We'll find

15
00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:45,084

00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:02,105
who would win in a fight between Spawn and Hellboy.
That's going to be a great match. On the Senjoh World

30
00:03:02,145 --> 00:03:07,149
podcast, host Zachary Hepburn speculates on
fights between fan favorite anime and manga

characters. This week, Zach's finding out who
would win in a battle between Sung-Jin Woo

32
00:03:12,212 --> 00:03:19,316
of Solo Leveling and Sid Kaganu of The Eminence
in Shadow. And sorry if I butchered those names.

33

37
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:48,579
But with that out of the way, quick to the no
prize. A no prize is an award that Marvel used

38
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,084
to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic
Duel No Prize, is a digital award that we post

39
00:03:54,124 --> 00:03:59,248
on Instagram for the person we feel gave the
best answer to our question of the week. Last

40
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:06,070
week, we asked you guys, what Marvel or DC television
series are you most looking forward to? in

41
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:12,153
2025. And we got a number of answers, but we
have three honorable mentions to go through

42
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:18,456
as well as the no prize winner. Our first honorable
mention goes to Michael Williams, who said,

43
00:04:19,037 --> 00:04:24,940
But Marvel TV show I'm looking forward to is
Wonder Man. I know that they are fictional

44
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:33,364
characters and I'm not a big fan of gender swapping
or race swapping, but that's the world we live

45
00:04:33,384 --> 00:04:40,938
in. So it'd be interesting to see. how they're
going to do these characters, backstory, change

46
00:04:40,978 --> 00:04:47,663
it up, and introduce them into the Marvel Universe.
Yeah, I feel like Wonder Man is the Marvel

47
00:04:47,703 --> 00:04:52,747
project that we know the least about currently,
probably because it's not coming out until

48
00:04:52,767 --> 00:05:00,674
the end of 2025, but it has a great cast in
Yaya Abdul-Mateen II, who has had a number

49
00:05:00,754 --> 00:05:06,742
of comic book roles under his belt, and also
like from the vague, preview of sorts that

50
00:05:06,762 --> 00:05:13,988
we got from the last D23 event. It looks fairly
interesting. It focuses heavily on the Hollywood

51
00:05:14,008 --> 00:05:20,832
system, but Michael Williams as a superhero
in Marvel is an actor and taking that route

52
00:05:20,913 --> 00:05:25,196
is something that we haven't seen before. So
at the very least, it's gonna give us something

53
00:05:25,296 --> 00:05:31,100
new. I'm excited just to get a Wonder Man series.
I've never liked the name Wonder Man because

54
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,868
it's just way too close to Wonder Woman. But
the character otherwise is pretty cool. Absolutely.

55
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:41,032
Yeah, if you guys want to learn more about Wonder
Man, listen to our duel episode where we pit

56
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:46,577
him against Captain Adam. He's a great character.
Thanks, Michael Williams. Our next honorable

57
00:05:46,657 --> 00:05:54,463
mention goes to Lee Tapscott, who said, Hi,
this is Lee Tapscott. What Marvel or DC show

58
00:05:54,523 --> 00:06:01,729
am I most looking forward to? Marvel zombies.
In this show, I'm hoping that they follow Spider-Man.

59
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:10,418
as he is traumatized by killing his family and
being the hero that he once was. Will he overcome

60
00:06:10,798 --> 00:06:19,723
the constant hunger and keep killing or will
he find a way to stop the zombies? Dude, same.

61
00:06:20,123 --> 00:06:25,186
And if you've read the Marvel zombies comic
books and followed the Spider-Man arc as far

62
00:06:25,226 --> 00:06:32,109
as that goes, it's truly fascinating, especially
like when he eats Sandman. It's kind of disturbing.

63
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:37,431
I don't know if the Marvel Zombies television
show will go that route, but there's definitely

64
00:06:37,531 --> 00:06:43,192
a lot of interesting areas to explore when it
comes to Spider-Man and the Marvel Zombies.

65
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:48,774
Like is he gonna eat Aunt May or Mary Jane and
all that stuff? We'll see if it follows the

66
00:06:48,814 --> 00:06:53,955
comic books by watching the show when it comes
out close to Halloween this year. Yeah, we

67
00:06:53,996 --> 00:07:00,917
broke down the storyline of Marvel Zombies in
our Deceased vs. Marvel Zombies episode. So...

68
00:07:01,514 --> 00:07:05,977
Don't listen to that if you don't want to be
spoiled as to what happens or could happen

69
00:07:06,317 --> 00:07:12,381
on the show. That was a fun episode. Thank you,
Lee. Our final honorable mention goes to McGee

70
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:17,745
Mathengian, who said, Hey, what's up, guys?
This is McGee. And the show I'm looking forward

71
00:07:17,785 --> 00:07:22,728
to the most this year is My Adventures with
Superman Season 3. Now, I know it hasn't been

72
00:07:22,768 --> 00:07:27,391
confirmed or anything, but hopefully we get
it this year. Me and my girlfriend have been

73
00:07:27,411 --> 00:07:33,374
watching it. We actually just finished. like
I've already seen it but I was watching it

74
00:07:33,414 --> 00:07:38,537
with her so it was her first time watching it
season two like season one and two um a couple

75
00:07:38,557 --> 00:07:43,138
of weeks ago and she loved it and so it's kind
of like our show now so my adventures with

76
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:48,441
Superman is probably one of the best modern
adaptations of the character of Superman to

77
00:07:48,561 --> 00:07:54,923
ever come out yeah totally I have yet to hear
anyone say that they dislike this series even

78
00:07:54,983 --> 00:08:01,418
people who don't like the character of Superman
seem to like this series which makes me Superman

79
00:08:01,618 --> 00:08:06,682
is DC's flagship character. And if there's one
character you need to get right, it's Superman.

80
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:12,706
Yeah, hopefully James Gunn's iteration of Superman
in his live action movie coming out this summer

81
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:19,511
matches the quality of the character that is
portrayed in this series. It needs to. And

82
00:08:19,551 --> 00:08:25,695
hopefully Miggi could go see that movie with
his girlfriend who is totally real. Ha ha ha.

83
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:30,879
But special thanks to Daniel Alonso, Jess and
Betty. Mason Thompson and Travis Herndon for

84
00:08:30,919 --> 00:08:36,263
calling in with their answer this week. But
the winner of this week's no prize is Jonathan

85
00:08:36,383 --> 00:08:42,367
and not Johnny DC, but a different Jonathan.
He said, Hey, my name is John and my most anticipated

86
00:08:42,407 --> 00:08:48,251
show for 2025 is obviously Daredevil for obvious
reasons. But Peacemaker season two is going

87
00:08:48,271 --> 00:08:52,974
to be a close second because that show is awesome.
And Creature Commando season two would have

88
00:08:52,994 --> 00:08:57,437
been there too. But there's no way they can
crank out a season two this year. But those

89
00:08:57,457 --> 00:09:03,887
are my Most anticipated picks. Shout out Peacemaker
Season Two for sure. All right, Jonathan, it

90
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:12,215
comes down to this. What series is gonna be
better in 2025? Daredevil Born Again or Peacemaker

91
00:09:12,235 --> 00:09:19,822
Season Two? Peacemaker Season Two. Oh, that's
the wrong answer. The correct answer was Daredevil

92
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:27,071
Born Again. Sorry. Try again next time. I do
think Daredevil Born Again is going to be a

93
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:31,994
fantastic show. Just based on the trailer, it
looks like it's going to be as good as the

94
00:09:32,474 --> 00:09:37,237
seasons that Netflix put out. At least I'm hoping
that's the case. I'm also really looking forward

95
00:09:37,257 --> 00:09:42,660
to Peacemaker Season 2 as well. Although I have
to say, it's not my most anticipated series

96
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:49,043
of this year from DC. That would probably be
going to Sandman Season 2 if that comes out

97
00:09:49,103 --> 00:09:54,470
this year. It may not. Yeah. That whole Neil
Gaiman thing is just kind of a... Shit show.

98
00:09:54,830 --> 00:10:02,475
Yeah, it's friggin' really weird. But no, I
love Peacemaker season one, and Peacemaker

99
00:10:02,515 --> 00:10:07,418
season two is definitely high on my list of
shows this year. So congrats to Jonathan for

100
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:11,981
winning this week's No Prize. If you the listener
want a shot at winning your own No Prize, stay

101
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:16,264
tuned to later on this episode when we'll be
asking another question of the week. But now

102
00:10:16,304 --> 00:10:18,365
that that's done, on to the news.

103
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:31,337
Alright, last week Deadline confirmed that Ulrich
Thompson has been cast as Sinestro for the

104
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:39,520
upcoming HBO series, Lanterns. This series of
course is set in James Gunn's DCU and it stars

105
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:47,523
Aaron Pierre as Jon Stewart and Kyle Chandler
as Hal Jordan. Sinestro of course is a major

106
00:10:47,644 --> 00:10:53,810
villain figure in Green Lantern mythology, although
I'm assuming that by the start of this series,

107
00:10:54,071 --> 00:11:01,316
he will still be a Green Lantern. I have no
idea who Ulrich Thompson is. Apparently he

108
00:11:01,356 --> 00:11:07,680
has been in series like Banshee for Cinemax.
He also had a recurring role on The Blacklist

109
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:14,425
that aired on NBC for a time, as well as counterpart
HBO's The Young Pope. He's a Scandinavian actor.

110
00:11:14,845 --> 00:11:18,868
Yeah, I've never seen a guy with so prominent
a filmography whom I've never heard of. He

111
00:11:18,888 --> 00:11:25,152
has a good look though for... Sinestro, so I'm
hoping he does well. Yeah, looks wise, he looks

112
00:11:25,392 --> 00:11:31,555
nothing like Mark Strong, who I thought nailed
the look of the character of Sinestro, if not

113
00:11:31,595 --> 00:11:38,019
the behavior in the infamous Green Lantern film.
I don't know, this guy, it just doesn't say

114
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:44,182
Sinestro to me personally. It says maybe like
Hitler, who the character of Sinestro was based

115
00:11:44,322 --> 00:11:50,494
on, just like comb his hair to the side and
give him like a mustache. Boom. Sure. I think

116
00:11:50,514 --> 00:11:54,938
that's what they're going for in this casting.
Yeah, I think it'll be interesting how they

117
00:11:54,998 --> 00:11:59,502
treat the character of Sinestro in this show
if he starts off as a Green Lantern and then

118
00:11:59,522 --> 00:12:06,288
we see that transition into his more villainous
persona. It always struck me as odd that it's

119
00:12:06,328 --> 00:12:11,412
surprising that a character with the name of
Sinestro turns evil. So I wonder how they're

120
00:12:11,432 --> 00:12:16,677
going to play that off in this series because
if the actors from Earth aren't like, wait,

121
00:12:16,757 --> 00:12:23,388
this guy... Just say his name is Sinestro. They
have to say something about it because otherwise

122
00:12:23,428 --> 00:12:27,489
it's just too awkward. There's some things you
can get away with in the comics that you can't

123
00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:32,571
get away with on screen. I'm sure the guy is
a terrific actor. Again, I don't know anything

124
00:12:32,611 --> 00:12:38,673
about him. But speaking of great villain actors,
that brings us to our question of the week.

125
00:12:43,254 --> 00:12:50,537
Which actor has given the best performance in
a villain role for a Marvel or DC series? Who's

126
00:12:50,577 --> 00:12:55,159
your favorite villain in a television show for
Marvel or DC basically? Record your answer

we include you on the podcast. We'll pick our

130
00:13:08,845 --> 00:13:13,830
favorite answer. and award that person a dynamic
duel no prize that we'll post to Instagram.

131
00:13:14,211 --> 00:13:16,917
Be sure to answer before February 1st.

132
00:13:24,226 --> 00:13:27,928
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and get into

133
00:13:27,988 --> 00:13:34,713
our main event where we find out who would win
in a fight between the mythological DC character

134
00:13:35,354 --> 00:13:40,377
of Cersei versus the Arthurian legend character,
Morgan Le Fay.

135
00:13:55,626 --> 00:14:01,608
Alright, Cersei versus Morgan Le Fay. This episode
is coming off of Creature Commando Season 1,

136
00:14:01,688 --> 00:14:07,911
in which Cersei played a minor role, but she's
a prominent Wonder Woman villain, so it was

137
00:14:07,951 --> 00:14:13,733
important, I think, to get her in a duel against
one of Marvel's most preeminent sorceress villainesses,

138
00:14:13,893 --> 00:14:20,316
Morgan Le Fay. Was Morgan Le Fay in that one
Renaissance what-if episode? Oh, what-if 1602?

139
00:14:22,117 --> 00:14:30,359
She was not. But Morgan Le Fay has played a
prominent live action role in the Runaway season

140
00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:36,064
three, where she was played actually by Elizabeth
Hurley. So she's kind of a big deal. Oh, Elizabeth

141
00:14:36,104 --> 00:14:42,449
Hurley, huh? Yeah. Cersei would be so lucky.
I am not even gonna debate you on that, because

142
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:49,195
I agree. Yeah, Cersei was pretty cool in Creature
Commando season one. I really hope though that

143
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:55,771
she eventually plays a role as the primary villain.
of a Wonder Woman live action movie. Well I'm

144
00:14:55,811 --> 00:15:00,675
hoping that she's going to pop up in the Paradise
Lost television series that was announced for

145
00:15:00,735 --> 00:15:05,498
the DCU about the island of the Mascara and
the Amazons. Yeah, it would make sense for

146
00:15:05,518 --> 00:15:10,942
her character to show up there. Yeah, and we'll
get into the backstory of Cersei and Morgan

147
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:15,325
Le Fay, but first to explain the methodology
behind our duels, let's go to our sentient

148
00:15:15,365 --> 00:15:21,709
duel simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ 9K, tell
our listeners how you go about determining

149
00:15:21,869 --> 00:15:23,938
a winner. in our Duel matchups.

150
00:15:52,782 --> 00:15:57,723
Additional stat categories are included such
as range, damage potential, versatility and

151
00:15:57,763 --> 00:16:02,684
perception in order to create a more detailed
and accurate simulation. The results of the

152
00:16:02,784 --> 00:16:07,506
1000 simulations provide a percentage of wins
for each character. The contestant with the

153
00:16:07,546 --> 00:16:12,187
higher percentage is declared the victor as
they have a higher probability to win any given

154
00:16:12,227 --> 00:16:18,169
battle. In an equitable pairing, neither character
should win 100% of the matches. The comic book

155
00:16:18,209 --> 00:16:22,742
stories have shown that there's even a way for
Batman to defeat Superman. So the confidence

156
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:27,044
rate of my method falls in line with the precedents
that have been established in the source material.

157
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:32,886
My mathematical simulations are without subjectivity
or bias. Feats are not the sole consideration,

158
00:16:33,247 --> 00:16:39,289
nor are fan votes tabulated for determination
of the winner. Thanks AJ9K! Before we run the

159
00:16:39,349 --> 00:16:43,511
simulations though, we like to break down each
character's histories and abilities before

160
00:16:43,571 --> 00:16:48,453
improvising a scenario on how we imagine one
of the 1000 simulations would play out beat

161
00:16:48,493 --> 00:16:53,223
for beat. And it's my turn to go first with
the DC characters backstory, so let me tell

162
00:16:53,243 --> 00:17:00,805
you all about Cersei. Now over 1200 years BC,
Cersei was born to the Titans Hyperion and

163
00:17:00,885 --> 00:17:07,427
Persace and raised as the Princess of Colchis,
a kingdom in the Caucasus region. Known for

164
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:13,168
her beauty and cunning, she murdered her weak
and unworthy husband, an act that led to her

165
00:17:13,228 --> 00:17:20,431
expulsion from the kingdom. Exiled and seeking
power, Cersei fled to the island of Aiea, where

166
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:26,795
she began studying the mystical arts and developed
a talent for sorcery. While her magic was initially

167
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:32,399
limited to the island, she used nearby sirens
to lure unsuspecting sailors and travelers,

168
00:17:32,499 --> 00:17:38,162
transforming them into animals as punishment
for their intrusion and to perfect her powers.

169
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:43,486
Her prayers for greater power reached the Greek
goddess Hecate, the goddess of witchcraft and

170
00:17:43,546 --> 00:17:48,667
an Olympian outcast who sought revenge against
the gods who had wronged her. Hecate offered

171
00:17:48,747 --> 00:17:54,989
Cersei a pact, immortality, eternal beauty,
and immense magical power in exchange for her

172
00:17:55,089 --> 00:18:00,571
soul. When Cersei accepted, Hecate transferred
her essence into the sorceress, dying in the

173
00:18:00,611 --> 00:18:06,192
process by uttering a chilling prophecy, upon
the death of which and the birth of which,

174
00:18:06,472 --> 00:18:12,986
Hecate, by name and choice, shall repossess
her soul. Initially unconcerned by the prophecy,

175
00:18:13,387 --> 00:18:19,089
Cersei reveled in her newfound abilities, using
them to raise Colchis in a single day. She

176
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:25,552
became infamous for her power to transform humans
into animals, creating subservient bestiomorphs,

177
00:18:25,872 --> 00:18:32,355
sometimes called animin, bound to her will.
Empowered by Hecate's hatred of the gods, Cersei

178
00:18:32,435 --> 00:18:38,297
relished in fostering discord between men and
women, sowing mistrust and animosity wherever

179
00:18:38,337 --> 00:18:44,211
she went. She became wary, however, when the
Amazons, warrior women blessed by the Olympian

180
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:50,393
gods, were created. Ares, the god of war, assured
Cersei that the Amazons would fall under his

181
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:55,314
schemes, however, and she initially allowed
him to act unchallenged. You can learn more

182
00:18:55,334 --> 00:19:01,656
about Ares in our Ares vs Loki duel episode.
When Hercules enslaved the Amazons, Cersei

183
00:19:01,696 --> 00:19:06,697
took advantage of the situation to create a
division amongst the group by manipulating

184
00:19:06,837 --> 00:19:13,252
Ariadne. into murdering Antiochus, the sister
of Apollita, who had brokered peace with Athens.

185
00:19:13,732 --> 00:19:20,315
This act resulted in a rift between the Themiscerian
Amazons and the newly formed Bona-Migdala tribe,

186
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:27,498
fulfilling Cersei's aim to weaken their unity.
For centuries, Cersei remained on Aaea, orchestrating

187
00:19:27,538 --> 00:19:32,740
chaos and destruction from afar when it suited
her. By modern times, she had retreated to

188
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:38,328
her island as an enigmatic recluse. But when
Wonder Woman appeared in Man's World, Cersei

189
00:19:38,368 --> 00:19:43,672
was surprised that Amazons had survived, as
all traces of them had vanished for hundreds

190
00:19:43,712 --> 00:19:49,157
of years. You can learn more about Wonder Woman
in our Wonder Woman vs. Thor episode. Fearing

191
00:19:49,257 --> 00:19:55,322
Diana was the fulfillment of Hecate's prophecy,
she plotted to destroy her, but feared direct

192
00:19:55,382 --> 00:20:01,747
confrontation. Cersei's attempt to revert Diana
back into clay failed when the Greek gods intervened,

193
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:07,202
but her obsession with the Amazon Princess endured.
Cersei's hatred for the Amazons led her to

194
00:20:07,262 --> 00:20:12,965
instigate a war of the gods between the Greek,
Roman, and Egyptian pantheons in an effort

195
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:18,367
to sap their power for herself. Cersei aligned
herself with the Banu-Migdhal Amazons, using

196
00:20:18,387 --> 00:20:23,670
them as pawns in her effort to discredit Wonder
Woman and the Themyscirans. Her plan reached

197
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:28,792
their apex when she killed Wonder Woman by finally
reverting her into the clay from which she

198
00:20:28,832 --> 00:20:33,406
had been formed. However, with the aid of the
Spectre and the Phantom Stranger... Wonder

199
00:20:33,446 --> 00:20:39,710
Woman was resurrected and Cersei's plot unraveled.
Hecate's soul abandoned Cersei during the battle,

200
00:20:40,051 --> 00:20:45,455
leaving her seemingly defeated. Following her
failure in the War of the Gods, Cersei turned

201
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:51,819
on her Bonamigdol Amazons, casting them and
the Themyscaryans into a demon-infested dimension.

202
00:20:52,199 --> 00:20:57,403
The Amazons spent years fighting for survival.
When Wonder Woman confronted her, Cersei was

203
00:20:57,443 --> 00:21:02,534
forced to return the island to its original
location after losing a wager with the Amazon

204
00:21:02,574 --> 00:21:08,876
Princess. In one of her most insidious schemes,
Cersei disguised herself as Donna Milton, a

205
00:21:08,956 --> 00:21:15,738
lawyer who befriended Diana to destroy her from
within. Cersei cast a spell on herself to suppress

206
00:21:15,758 --> 00:21:20,739
her memories of her true identity, ensuring
the Donna Milton persona would remain genuine

207
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:26,381
and immune to one romance lasso of truth. Under
the skies, she became romantically involved

208
00:21:26,421 --> 00:21:32,489
with Ares Buchanan. the mortal guise of the
god Ares, and gave birth to their daughter,

209
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:39,135
Leda Milton. Eventually, Diana realized Donna's
true nature, and though Cersei's memories returned,

210
00:21:39,575 --> 00:21:45,440
she found herself emotionally conflicted due
to her new attachment to Diana as Donna Milton.

211
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:51,185
In a rare act of selflessness, she saved Diana
during a confrontation with a villain known

212
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:56,189
as the White Magician. Cersei later struck a
deal with the demon Neuron to increase her

213
00:21:56,229 --> 00:22:01,987
magical power. She joined Lex Luthor's Injustice
Gang, attempting to destroy the Justice League

214
00:22:02,308 --> 00:22:07,830
by turning its members against one another.
She clashed with Wonder Woman repeatedly, including

215
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:13,152
during an attack on New York City, where she
transformed male superheroes into beast geomorphs,

216
00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:18,375
and transformed Superman into a doomsday-like
monster to kill Wonder Woman. Later, Cersei

217
00:22:18,415 --> 00:22:24,757
empowered Wonder Woman's rogues, including Cheetah,
Giganta, and Dr. Psycho, to test the Amazons'

218
00:22:24,797 --> 00:22:30,354
resolve. She stole Wonder Woman's powers during
this period and declared herself the new Wonder

219
00:22:30,374 --> 00:22:35,758
Woman. However, Diana eventually regained her
abilities, defeated Cersei, and banished her

220
00:22:35,858 --> 00:22:41,703
once again. In post-Flashpoint continuity, Cersei
was reimagined as a red-haired bearer of the

221
00:22:41,763 --> 00:22:49,998
Witch Mark, which signified her possession of
a fragment of Hecate's soul. in a plot to manipulate

222
00:22:50,038 --> 00:22:54,803
Superman into fighting Wonder Woman, the combined
efforts of Superman and Wonder Woman thwarted

223
00:22:54,823 --> 00:23:00,728
her plans. Cersei later became entangled with
Veronica Cale, an entrepreneur seeking vengeance

224
00:23:00,788 --> 00:23:05,552
against the Sons of Ares for kidnapping her
daughter. Together, they trapped Phobos and

225
00:23:05,572 --> 00:23:11,276
Deimos, the twin Sons of Ares, in animal forms.
Cersei deduced that Cale's daughter was being

226
00:23:11,317 --> 00:23:17,702
held on Themyscira, but refused to help further,
fearing the consequences of freeing Ares. When

227
00:23:17,762 --> 00:23:23,005
Hecate sought to reclaim her soul through the
Witchmarks, Cersei manipulated events to inherit

228
00:23:23,045 --> 00:23:28,529
Hecate's full power. She pretended to assist
Wonder Woman and the Justice League Dark in

229
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:34,554
fighting Hecate, but secretly sought to destroy
her patron. Her plan succeeded, and with Hecate's

230
00:23:34,594 --> 00:23:41,078
death, Cersei became the new Goddess of Magic.
She formed the Injustice League Dark, recruiting

231
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:47,875
powerful magical beings to challenge Wonder
However, her plans were thwarted when Diana

232
00:23:48,055 --> 00:23:53,919
used the power of Eclipso to defeat her. Rather
than destroy Cersei, Diana imprisoned her in

233
00:23:53,939 --> 00:23:59,203
a magical mirror, allowing her to retain her
newfound power, but barring her from using

234
00:23:59,323 --> 00:24:05,888
it against others. That's Cersei's backstory.
Power-wise, Cersei is a goddess-level sorceress

235
00:24:05,928 --> 00:24:12,412
with vast magical power. Her abilities include
matter and energy manipulation, reality alteration,

236
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:18,975
and teleportation. She's best known for transforming
humans into beast geomorphs, which are animal-like

237
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:25,637
beings under her control. She can project destructive
magical blasts, erect defensive shields, and

238
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:31,139
summon creatures to do her bidding. Cersei's
immortality prevents her from aging, and she

239
00:24:31,199 --> 00:24:36,760
is highly resistant to physical harm. She also
has limited clairvoyance, allowing her to foresee

240
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:42,118
events and sense the presence of other immortals.
And that's Cersei! I think the most surprising

241
00:24:42,158 --> 00:24:47,723
thing there is that my knowledge of the mythological
Cersei was primarily from the Odyssey, but

242
00:24:47,743 --> 00:24:53,348
the fact that the Amazonians came after the
events of that story was interesting. Well,

243
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:59,253
not necessarily, because she had been on the
island of Aya for a while, even after the Amazons,

244
00:24:59,293 --> 00:25:04,317
so she stayed there. Alright, so I thought I
had the Amazons chronologically placed in a

245
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:10,706
certain time, but yeah, it's pretty vague, I
guess, when they started. Greek Myth! is not

246
00:25:10,826 --> 00:25:18,133
as interesting as Arthurian legend. So, oh,
what? You heard me. That's right. Let me go

247
00:25:18,153 --> 00:25:24,678
ahead and get into the Arthurian legend that
is Morgan Le Fay. Now, Morgan Le Fay was born

248
00:25:24,778 --> 00:25:31,444
in the magical Celtic realm of Avalon during
the sixth century days of Camelot. She's the

249
00:25:31,484 --> 00:25:38,910
daughter of a grain, the sea princess, and an
unknown father of fairy lineage. A young sorcerer

250
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:45,172
from Avalon named Merlin forewarned of a great
catastrophe that would befall Egraine's kingdom

251
00:25:45,592 --> 00:25:51,273
and helped the mother and daughter flee to Earth's
realm in Britain. There Merlin arranged for

252
00:25:51,353 --> 00:25:59,176
Egraine to marry Gorloi, Duke of Tintagel who
adopted the young Morgan. King Uther Pendragon

253
00:25:59,216 --> 00:26:06,054
of England lusted after Egraine and killed Gorloi,
taking Morgan's mother as his own bride. When

254
00:26:06,074 --> 00:26:12,818
Negrane birthed them a son, Morgan became the
half-sister of Arthur Pendragon, whom Merlin

255
00:26:12,858 --> 00:26:18,702
had prophesied would become the greatest king
of Britain. Merlin trained Morgan Le Fay in

256
00:26:18,762 --> 00:26:25,731
sorcery as she grew up, and she became his apprentice
and later lover. though the alliance soon unraveled

257
00:26:25,811 --> 00:26:31,697
when she grew furious with his apparent abandonment
of their relationship in favor of King Arthur's

258
00:26:31,797 --> 00:26:36,962
reign and the spread of Christianity, since
Morrigan was a disciple of the old Druidic

259
00:26:37,002 --> 00:26:42,607
ways of Britain. She had resented King Arthur
from the moment of his birth, and allied herself

260
00:26:42,627 --> 00:26:48,632
with his bastard son and her nephew, Mordred,
often conspiring with him against both Camelot

261
00:26:48,912 --> 00:26:54,457
and Arthur himself. Morgan's long rivalry with
Merlin intensified, given his role as royal

262
00:26:54,517 --> 00:27:00,842
advisor and enforcer against her plots. She
occasionally resided at Castle Le Fay, which

263
00:27:00,882 --> 00:27:06,146
was gifted to her by Arthur in his attempts
to keep peace, but she continued to undermine

264
00:27:06,186 --> 00:27:12,131
him from within. In her early forays into black
magic, Morgan led a cult who worshipped the

265
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:18,516
elder god Chthon, the god of chaos. She assembled
and helped bind his scattered scrolls into

266
00:27:18,556 --> 00:27:26,082
a single tome known as the Darkhold. Unfortunately
for her, the summon to C'thun proved too powerful

267
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:31,626
to control, so Morgan and her followers bound
him within Wundergorm Mountain. You can learn

268
00:27:31,686 --> 00:27:38,290
more about C'thun and Wundergorm Mountain in
our Zatanna vs Scarlet Witch One of her disciples,

269
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:43,653
Magnus, eventually saw the evil in her ways
and stole the Darkhold to prevent Morrigan

270
00:27:43,693 --> 00:27:49,737
from abusing its contents. She slew Magnus in
retaliation, but lost her access to the book's

271
00:27:49,837 --> 00:27:55,780
dark secrets. Her conflicts with Arthur often
centered on the sword Excalibur, which she

272
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:02,484
tried to sabotage by striking a chip from the
real blade and forging a hellish replica. She

273
00:28:02,544 --> 00:28:07,800
resented Lancelot. one of the Knights of the
Round Table for spurring her affections, and

274
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:13,525
she eventually exposed Lancelot's affair with
Arthur's Queen Guinevere, fracturing the Court

275
00:28:13,565 --> 00:28:19,870
of Camelot from within and helping incite the
civil war that spelled Arthur's downfall. As

276
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:26,435
these events reached their climax, Merlin intervened
repeatedly, eventually having Morgan imprisoned

277
00:28:26,555 --> 00:28:31,820
with a powerful enchantment, though she managed
to project her astral form beyond physical

278
00:28:34,318 --> 00:28:40,559
throughout time. When Mordred gravely wounded
his father, the king, Morgan's astral form

279
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:46,801
transported Arthur's soul to Avalon, yet her
hatred of his legacy of Camelot endured, and

280
00:28:46,841 --> 00:28:52,503
she continued her quest for greater power from
within her imprisonment. She was particularly

281
00:28:52,543 --> 00:28:57,724
determined to retrieve the Darkhold in future
centuries, believing it could finally free

282
00:28:57,764 --> 00:29:03,626
her from Merlin's longstanding bindings and
allow her to rule unrestricted. Over centuries,

283
00:29:03,786 --> 00:29:10,128
Morgan repeatedly manifested in eras beyond
her original timeline. In the modern age, she

284
00:29:10,188 --> 00:29:15,290
often confronted heroes such as Doctor Strange
and the Avengers. She tried to possess people

285
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:21,792
to bypass her constraints, including the heroine
Spider-Woman, aka Jessica Drew, whose body

286
00:29:21,892 --> 00:29:27,695
she temporarily took control of. Morgan also
clashed with Iron Man. whom she met when Dr.

287
00:29:27,735 --> 00:29:32,719
Doom time traveled back to her era and struck
a deal with her in exchange for knowledge of

288
00:29:32,759 --> 00:29:38,925
the dark arts. Doom promised to help Morgan's
forces if she would aid in rescuing his mother's

289
00:29:38,965 --> 00:29:45,531
soul from hell, yet the uneasy alliance ended
in betrayal on both sides, creating an enduring

290
00:29:45,651 --> 00:29:51,296
enmity. Morgan nonetheless taught Doom much
about sorcery, and the two maintained a recurrent

291
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:57,447
tangled relationship across time. sometimes
as lovers, other times as bitter enemies. They

292
00:29:57,547 --> 00:30:03,108
even produced a daughter, Caroline Le Fay. You
can learn more about Dr. Doom in his duel against

293
00:30:03,288 --> 00:30:08,450
Superman. Morgan later tapped into the magic
of the Asgardian artifact known as the Twilight

294
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:15,132
Sword, which she used to reshape reality, forging
a medieval-style Earth with herself as its

295
00:30:15,172 --> 00:30:21,093
sole ruler, presiding over Earth's mightiest
heroes. She also raised armies of the dead,

296
00:30:21,514 --> 00:30:26,957
enslaved powerful beings like the Scarlet Witch,
and attempted to resurrect the sunken continent

297
00:30:26,997 --> 00:30:33,682
of Atlantis, mistaking it for her fabled Avalon.
From the past, she later fought Norman Osborn's

298
00:30:33,742 --> 00:30:39,506
Dark Avengers with an army of demons. Although
the Dark Avengers destroyed her several times

299
00:30:39,526 --> 00:30:44,730
in that confrontation, she kept resurrecting
herself in the past into the present until

300
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:50,478
Doctor Doom and Iron Patriot traveled back to
her timeline and magically exiled her. into

301
00:30:50,538 --> 00:30:56,962
her own dark cauldron. Even that proved temporary
however as Morgan's daughter Caroline retrieved

302
00:30:56,982 --> 00:31:01,785
her from the cauldron and Morgan raised undead
armies throughout Europe bringing her into

303
00:31:01,825 --> 00:31:07,790
conflict with the Avengers yet again. She later
attempted to conquer Camelot which Merlin transported

304
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:13,113
into the realm of Avalon and she fought against
Captain Britton and his sister Betsy Braddock.

305
00:31:13,493 --> 00:31:19,922
She put Captain Britton under her spell forcing
Betsy to don his amulet of right artifact to

306
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:24,846
become the new Captain Britain, which you can
learn more about in our Uncle Sam vs Captain

307
00:31:24,906 --> 00:31:30,771
Britain Duel episode. And that's her backstory.
Powers-wise, Morgan Le Fay is an accomplished

308
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:36,876
sorceress with a vast array of mystical abilities
that include reality warping, magical time

309
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:45,383
travel, necromancy, self-resurrection, flight,
shape-shifting, transmutation, energy manipulation,

310
00:31:45,783 --> 00:31:52,060
illusion casting, astral projection, and and
duplication. Her one weakness due to her fairy

311
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:58,404
heritage is the metal of iron. And that's her
backstory. I guess I should say that Cersei

312
00:31:58,424 --> 00:32:05,529
has a weakness as well. And that is an herb
known as Molly, I think. Like ecstasy? It's

313
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:12,074
gotta be. I don't know. Well, so convenient
of you to leave that out of her backstory.

314
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:18,169
I'm pretty sure it's harder to find this herb
than it is fucking iron. That's ridiculous.

315
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:21,342
Who knows? Molly's everywhere these days. Stay
safe, kids.

316
00:32:29,134 --> 00:32:34,755

where we settle the debate and settle the score.

324
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:19,811
Well now that we've got their histories and
abilities out of the way, let's speculate on

325
00:33:19,871 --> 00:33:25,792
how one of the 1000 simulated matches will go.
The winner is determined by simulations, not

326
00:33:25,852 --> 00:33:31,174
this speculation, but it's fun to imagine how
the fight could play out. AJ and NK, what are

327
00:33:31,194 --> 00:33:36,755
the rules of our speculation? Well, I should
say there are no rules, other than the characters

328
00:33:36,775 --> 00:33:41,317
have no prior knowledge of the other going into
the fight. All they are aware of starting out

329
00:33:41,637 --> 00:33:45,962
is that the other character is a threat that
needs to be eliminated. For the speculation,

330
00:33:46,242 --> 00:33:50,924
the contestants will begin approximately 50
meters apart in a non-descript environment

331
00:33:51,164 --> 00:33:55,686
that will have no bearing on the match itself,
as no environmental statistics are considered

332
00:33:55,706 --> 00:34:00,888
in my simulations. The contestants must earn
victory on their own merit. Alright, then let's

333
00:34:00,908 --> 00:34:07,030
get into it. Cersei and Morgan Le Fay meet on
the battlefield. Who goes first? Morgan Le

334
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:13,713
Fay, she usually wears jewelry, right? Like
a necklace? Mmm... Like a skull necklace? Yeah.

335
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:20,393
Okay. Well, I'm going to say that Cersei starts
by transforming that skull necklace into like

336
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:26,357
this snake creature that just chokes and bites
her. All right. OK, well, before the snake

337
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:33,442
bites her, Morgan Lafay transforms it into a
chain, which she, you know, unfurls from around

338
00:34:33,462 --> 00:34:40,407
her neck and she casts across the battlefield
over to Cersei and binds her up with it. And

339
00:34:40,427 --> 00:34:47,264
it transports her into this dark dungeon. inside
a medieval castle. What is this chain made

340
00:34:47,324 --> 00:34:53,249
of? Is it iron? No, like, I don't know. It's
fucking made out of lead or something. Okay,

341
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:59,734
just checking. In this medieval dungeon, Cersei,
she's just gonna blast off her chains, her

342
00:34:59,754 --> 00:35:05,619
shackles or whatever, with these purple magic
bolts. And once she's free, she's also gonna

343
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:11,764
blast Morgan with those bolts as well. Except
that in this dungeon, Morgan Le Fay has like

344
00:35:11,784 --> 00:35:18,207
this skeleton army guarding her. that takes
the brunt of this magical blast. And she uses

345
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:26,149
the fallen skeleton army bodies and she reforms
them into this massive bone dragon that just

346
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:32,411
blasts down a flame of green eldritch fire that
engulfs her sea and burns her alive. Forest

347
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:39,033
field, all right? Magical forest field. It blocks
those flames. And while she's protecting herself.

348
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:44,474
Cersei is going to take the stones that make
up the walls of the dungeon around her and

349
00:35:44,614 --> 00:35:51,840
use them to form a giant rock minotaur that
just dashes straight into the dragon scattering

350
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:57,125
its bones everywhere and then the minotaur is
gonna look at Morgan Lafay and he's gonna charge

351
00:35:57,165 --> 00:36:04,791
into her just impaling her on its horns Except
as the minotaur rushes at Morgan Lafay It's

352
00:36:04,811 --> 00:36:10,462
gonna pass through this like time spell that's
gonna de-age this rock Minotaur until, you

353
00:36:10,482 --> 00:36:18,385
know, it's just a Minotaur rock calf baby. And
it stumbles and falls onto the ground into

354
00:36:18,405 --> 00:36:23,786
like a bunch of little pebbles, okay? And each
of those are gonna get transposed into this

355
00:36:24,206 --> 00:36:31,108
fairy being. And now Morgan Le Fay is in command
of this fairy army, and she's gonna send them

356
00:36:31,168 --> 00:36:38,026
out like a legion of kamikaze pilots that just
tear through Cersei. Like a barrage of glowing

357
00:36:38,146 --> 00:36:45,768
magical bullets. Oh damn, okay. Like Tinkerbells.
Yeah. All right, so Cersei, she's being pummeled

358
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:52,510
by these fairy bullets and she's still in this
damn dungeon. So she's just gonna teleport

359
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:58,512
out of there and from outside of whatever medieval
castle they were just in, she's gonna cause

360
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:03,933
an earthquake beneath it that just brings the
whole castle crumbling down on top of Morgan.

361
00:37:04,393 --> 00:37:12,303
Okay, so. Morgan gets buried by Castle Lafay,
but from the rubble, she's gonna sprout this

362
00:37:12,403 --> 00:37:20,265
massive plant with like a flower bulb from which
she emerges safe and sound and she commands

363
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:26,687
the roots of this plant to emerge from the ground
and wrap up Cersei with all these vines that

364
00:37:26,767 --> 00:37:32,669
drain her of her power until she's just a husk.
Okay, but as these roots are approaching Cersei,

365
00:37:35,746 --> 00:37:41,809
that gives her an iron touch, you know, kind
of like Midas's golden touch, but with iron,

366
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:49,833
all right? So this plant that Morgan was inside
of is now just an iron trap that burns her

367
00:37:49,873 --> 00:37:55,896
to death, giving Cersei the win. I said she
emerged from the plant. Okay, but not in time.

368
00:37:55,956 --> 00:38:03,721
Okay, well, except that the giant plant that
Cersei tried to turn into iron, it actually

369
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:10,987
turns out that the plant Molly, the herb, which
disrupts Cersei's magic. So it doesn't turn

370
00:38:11,007 --> 00:38:17,609
to iron. It turns into this like impure metal
that Cersei just thinks is iron. But it's actually

371
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:23,331
like some kind of like Molly metal compound.
We'll say molybdenum, okay? Molybdenum. What?

372
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:30,172
All right. And Morgan Le Fay crafts a giant
sword out of this metal that she swings at

373
00:38:30,212 --> 00:38:36,767
Cersei and it decapitates her, ending this match.
How the heck did Morgan even know Cersei was

374
00:38:36,987 --> 00:38:44,131
weak to Molly? Well, how did Cersei know that
Morgan Le Fay was weak to Iron? Dude, Cersei

375
00:38:44,151 --> 00:38:49,814
is like a lot older than Morgan. She knows all
those Celtic fairies are weak to that shit.

376
00:38:49,914 --> 00:38:54,537
How does she know that Morgan's like a fairy
folk, like a descendant of that? She doesn't

377
00:38:54,557 --> 00:38:59,580
know that. And also, like Morgan Le Fay has
been around long enough to know by the present

378
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:06,687
time that like Cersei was... a figure that is
weak to the fucking molly herb. Morgan's been

379
00:39:06,707 --> 00:39:12,110
around long enough. Oh, yeah. Morgan's been
around. All right. Yeah. Marvel villain village

380
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:18,232
bicycle over here, like you said earlier, checks
out. Hey, we don't villain shame around here.

381
00:39:18,452 --> 00:39:24,535
OK. All right. Well, go ahead and run the stats
on these characters and find out which scenario

382
00:39:24,575 --> 00:39:33,206
happens. Either Cersei traps Morgan Le Fay in
an iron plant that burns her to death. or Morgan

383
00:39:33,226 --> 00:39:40,090
Le Fay creates a molybdenum sword that decapitates
Cersei. We'll run the stats and find out who

384
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:48,355
came out on top. AJ9K, hit it. Inputting data,
running calculations, processing results, simulations

385
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:56,340
complete. All right, these sorceresses were
pretty close in their statistics. There were

386
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:00,950
just a few instances in which they deferred.
Like we said that- Morgan Le Fay was faster

387
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:07,153
primarily because, you know, the official Marvel
power grid said that she was faster, I think

388
00:40:07,193 --> 00:40:12,536
because she can transport her consciousness
through time and space. Whereas Cersei, you

389
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:17,358
know, sticks to the present. Right, but we did
give the edge to Cersei when it came to fighting

390
00:40:17,398 --> 00:40:22,640
skill because she actually throws hands with
Wonder Woman on occasion, whereas Morgan Le

391
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:28,107
Fay really never fights physically. Right, yeah,
never. Regarding the rest of the stats, they

392
00:40:28,127 --> 00:40:32,508
were actually similar. Like, they're pretty
much identical, especially when it comes to

393
00:40:32,548 --> 00:40:37,531
abasiveness, durability, strength. Actually,
we did say that Cersei was a little bit stronger

394
00:40:37,551 --> 00:40:42,933
than Morgan Le Fay physically. Right, yes, but
everything else was the same. So taking all

395
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:47,835
of this data into consideration, Joseph, who
do you think came out on top? Morgan Le Fay?

396
00:40:47,855 --> 00:40:54,257
That's not even a question. Don't even ask me.
Morgan Le Fay. I literally just asked you.

397
00:40:54,277 --> 00:40:58,491
Well, Don't do that again. And I don't even
want to know what the Instagram followers say.

398
00:40:58,671 --> 00:41:04,792
71% of them picked Cersei to win, so they're
obviously biased. Actually, I've been looking

399
00:41:04,832 --> 00:41:10,614
back at the Instagram polls, like a majority
of them have come out DC recently, which is

400
00:41:11,074 --> 00:41:17,016
fascinating and awesome. And lame. What the
fuck is going on there? We have way too many

401
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:22,577
DC fans following us on Instagram. We need more
Marvel guys on there. Well, let's check out

402
00:41:22,597 --> 00:41:30,116
the actual winning percentage. AJ9K the results
please. Here you are, sir.. The winner of the matchup

403
00:41:30,416 --> 00:41:41,841
between Circe and Morgan Le Fay is... Circe
by 59.6% compared to Morgan Le Fay's 40.4%

404
00:41:43,221 --> 00:41:52,365
which means she only wins 404 of the 1000 simulated
matches compared to Circe's 596. Well, I'm

405
00:41:52,385 --> 00:41:56,655
going to call it bullshit. on those results,
even if it affects our credibility. I'm going

406
00:41:56,675 --> 00:42:05,260
to call bullshit. Why? Because I don't like
it. When it came down to it. Yes, Morgan Le

407
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:12,064
Fay was faster, but she couldn't outmatch Circe's
strength and fighting skill. You can say that,

408
00:42:12,504 --> 00:42:16,826
but it's still not going to make me accept it.
Oh, look, everyone, Joseph doesn't want to

409
00:42:16,906 --> 00:42:25,307
accept reality. I accept my reality. OK. You
can take your reality. That's good for you.

410
00:42:25,387 --> 00:42:31,269
I accept that for you. And then I'll just take
my reality where Morgan LeFay wins. Yeah. Ooh,

411
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:37,232
sorry, but the numbers do not lie. That does
not work. Sucks to suck, but that does it for

412
00:42:37,252 --> 00:42:45,064

Podcast Network, including Max Destruction,

417
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:14,583
Senjou World and Konsole Kombat. In our next
episode, we are doing a duel that was chosen

418
00:43:14,623 --> 00:43:21,027
by our executive producer, Mickey Math and Gian,
and that is Blockbuster versus Tombstone. Yeah,

419
00:43:21,067 --> 00:43:27,291
Tombstone is a prominent Spider-Man villain.
And Blockbuster was a old video rental store

420
00:43:27,451 --> 00:43:33,355
from the 90s. Tombstone's a pizza, bro. But
that is for this episode. We want to give a

421
00:43:33,415 --> 00:43:38,738
big thanks to our executive producers, Ken Johnson,
John Sturowski, Zachary Hepburn. Dustin Balcom,

Wagner, Levi Yeaton, Austin Wyslowski, AJ Dunkerley,

423

Molesky, Devin Davis, Joseph Kersting, Josh

424
00:43:50,283 --> 00:43:55,285

425
00:43:55,305 --> 00:44:00,467
talk to you guys next week. Up up and away,
true believers. Not Joseph having too many

426
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:04,889
drinks before recording this episode and slurring
his words like a dental patient. Damn.
