This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi, welcome to
the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,860
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:38,220
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin

4
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:45,340
brother Marvelous Joe, holy shit. And as you can
tell from the sound of Joseph's voice, he is very

5
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:51,540
sick, so he will be doing as little talking as
possible this episode, being a dual episode

6
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:58,140
between Blue Beetle, the Ted Kord incarnation,
and Prowler, the Spider-Man villain. He's mostly

7
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,520
an ally. Well that's news to me. I thought he was a
bad guy. Interesting. Alright, well we're gonna

8
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,120
find out more about him later on in this episode.
Before that, we are not going to break down any

9
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,500
comic book movie news from the past week because
there hasn't been any really some behind-the-set

10
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,140
photos, but I don't know if things are made with AI
nowadays. So until it's confirmed by the studio,

11
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:25,220
I'm just going to assume everything is fake.
Fucking crickets. This is what happens when

12
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:32,980
Joseph can't speak. I have no one to laugh at my
jokes. Jokes suck, bro. Your voice sucks, bro. As

13
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,740
always, we list our segment times in our episode

26
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,140
yesterday's episode, they speculated on who

27
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:56,860
Star Fox piloting his R-Wing against Wedge and
Tilly's from Star Wars Rogue Squadron piloting

the 1988 film Bloodsport. And finally on the Sanjo
World podcast, hosts Zachary Hepburn speculates

31
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,700
on fights between fan favorite anime and manga
characters. On Thursday, Zach is going to reveal

32
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:28,800

Quick to the no prize! A no prize is an award that

35
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:48,360
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version, the
Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award that we

36
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,180
post on Instagram for the person we feel gave the
best answer to our question of the week. Last week,

37
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:00,800
we asked, what do you think of Crypto the Superdog
from the Superman sneak peek? And of course, this

38
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,000
question was in regards to the extended trailer
that we received for the Superman film that came

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,140
out of CinemaCon. We got four answers, so let's
break down this week's three honorable mentions

40
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:18,600
before revealing the no prize winner. Our first
honorable mention goes to Christopher Minotti,

41
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,600
who said, Hi guys, Christopher Minotti. So
Crypto, he's a little fluffier than I was

42
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,020
expecting, but I'm still hoping that they do a good
job with him. I get that he's supposed to be the cute

43
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:34,320
character, the lighthearted, well not
lighthearted, he's a dog, so of course. But I'm

44
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,260
still hoping that they do a good job with him, and
I'm hoping that they have a cool scene with him. The

45
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,620
first time I realized Crypto was cool was in
Blackest Night, when he saved Martha Kent by

46
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,380
ripping up Black Lantern's arm off and then
blasting it with Heat Vision. Yeah, and the comics

47
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:56,500
Crypto is no joke. He is fiercely loyal and doesn't
have the same morality that someone say like

48
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:03,120
Superman has. So he's actually fairly dangerous.
This version of the dog is very fluffy, you know,

49
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,600
usually he's depicted as a Labrador of some sorts,
but here he looks very much like almost like a

50
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,960
poodle terrier mutt kind of dog. So they're
definitely trying to play up the cute factor with

51
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:21,820
him, which is all right. I guess the cuter the dog
is, the more audiences will be happy with it, but

52
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:28,520
we'll see how it goes. As I said in the last episode,
I have full confidence in James Gunn's writing,

53
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,360
especially when it comes to animal characters,
you take a look at Rocker at Coon or something like

54
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:38,780
that. So I think things should be fine. Didn't
Crypto almost kill Mongol? Yeah, actually he

55
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:43,040
straight up bit his throat nearly killing him.
Great answer Christopher, our next honorable

56
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:51,360
mention goes to Lee Tapscott, who said, What do I
think about Crypto in the Superman trailer? Man, I

57
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,820
love this. I think dogs can really sense if a
person's good or bad. And Crypto just you can just

58
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:06,840
tell he loves Superman. Superman is so good to him.
This makes me care about him so much in the energy.

59
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,400
And when it comes push to shove, he knows exactly
what his master needs, takes him right to the help

60
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,220
opens up that door. Smart dog. Yeah, like we
mentioned in the last episode, people are kind of

61
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:24,580
trashing Crypto's intelligence, but I kind of see
it as him being well trained to an extent, right?

62
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:28,640
He's really happy to see his owner. So he's jumping
on his owner. But once he realizes something is

63
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:34,100
wrong, he listens to him and takes him straight to
the fortress of solitude. One of the secret

64
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,620
shortcuts of getting a character to be likable in
film is to give them a dog character and have them be

65
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:44,700
nice to a dog. I've brought this up before. I don't
know if this is what James Gunn is trying to do with

66
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,200
Superman, just to make him more endearing to
audiences who may not necessarily care for the

67
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,900
character. But if he plays his cards right, story
wise, I think he could totally pull that off

68
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:59,320
between the characters of Crypto and Superman.
Because dogs, like Lee Tapscott said, are

69
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:04,020
naturally intuitive. And if you like Superman,
general audiences will gather that, oh, this is a

70
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:10,280
trustworthy character. Great answer, Lee. Our
final honorable mention goes to Peter, who said,

71
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:16,280
what's up, dynamic dudes? It's Peter. My thoughts
on Crypto was, I thought it was really funny,

72
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:22,520
honestly. Like when I first saw the trailer, I
laughed audibly, thinking that's a cute dog.

73
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:28,300
That's something that my dog would do if I had one,
which I don't. But if I did, he would act like that.

74
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,660
And especially since they're training him, I
think it'd be a fun part to the movie. So that's what

75
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:40,540
I got to say. Thanks, guys. Peter Yeah. So every dog
I've had, I've rescued from an animal shelter. And

76
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:46,500
they're not the best trained of dogs. When I come
home, my dog, Olive, is still super excited. She's

77
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:51,600
a little white chihuahua, and you know, she'll hop
on me. It doesn't bother me because she's so small.

78
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:57,820
I'm sure if she was the size of Crypto, I would be
more irritated by it. But yeah, I totally related

79
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:04,000
to Crypto jumping on Superman in this extended
trailer. Again, I didn't love it initially. But

80
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,620
once I realized, oh, hey, yeah, this reminds me of
my dog, it became much easier to understand what

81
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:15,980
James Gunn was trying to do with this dog, because
he said before that Crypto was inspired by his dog

82
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:22,040
that he rescued, who's not necessarily well
behaved. And so for him to put that into the movie is

83
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,460
a slice of life of sorts. And it's definitely one
that I recognized for my own life. And I think a lot

84
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:33,480
of people might have an 80 pound German shepherd
mix named Bucky. And I got to say if he did to me, what

85
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:38,299
Crypto did to Superman, I'd be pissed. I don't
know, but there's also something to be said for a

86
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:43,620
big lovable dog that loves you unconditionally
and just wants to give you a big hug and kiss when you

87
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:49,140
come home. That's true. I love my dog. Great
answer, Peter. The winner of this week's no prize,

88
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:55,360
however, is Travis Herndon. Who said? What's up,
Jeremy? Dude's Travis here. Shout out to my even

89
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,360
twin. So my answer is I like Crypto and honestly, he
doesn't deserve to hate him. Yes, especially from

90
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:06,360
a certain YouTuber saying that like, well, my dog,
he ain't dog, he's stuff though, whimpered and

91
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,740
whined when I pretend to be hurting stuff. And to
that, Crypto is based off of James Gunn's own dog

92
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:18,800
who was a rowdy, rambunctious puppy. So I mean, it
wouldn't make sense why he would be acting like

93
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,960
that. It's based off his own dog. Yeah, I'm not sure
which YouTuber Travis is referring to. But like

94
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:31,220
I've said, the inclusion of Crypto was inspired by
James Gunn's own dog, who he rescued from a

95
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,960
shelter. And you just got to admire that, you know,
taking a dog that could have been put down and

96
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,720
giving it a new home, giving it a loving family,
whether it's behaved or not, you know, it still

97
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:50,320
deserves to have the love of James Gunn and his
family. For him to include the character of his dog

98
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,500
in the movie, I think is pretty awesome
personally. And I have to say, I'm pretty happy

99
00:09:56,500 --> 00:10:03,000
that everyone who called in seemed to enjoy Crypto
because I was worried that a lot of people weren't,

100
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,260
you know, the internet could be a pretty negative
place sometimes. But shout out to all of our

101
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,740
listeners, especially the ones who have just
called in who like Crypto. I think he's going to be a

102
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:18,780
fun addition to the Superman film that comes out
this July. Yeah, don't be a cynical asshole on the

103
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:25,680
internet like dogs, right? Yeah, what are you,
some kind of dog hater? YouTube guy. Yeah, whoever

104
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,860
you are. Great answer, Travis. You win the Speak to
No Prize. If you're the listener want to shout at

105
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,420
winning your own no prize, stay tuned to later on in
this episode when we'll be asking another

106
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:45,340
question of the week. Another that's done. On to
the question of the week. So as we mentioned,

107
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:54,160
there's no big comic book movie news from this past
week. So we're going to ask, but we want to know

108
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,100
what's your favorite Marvel or DC comic that
you're reading right now and why it's really hard

109
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,800
for me to stay up to date with current comics. I feel
like all of the comics I read are just to do research

110
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:12,700
for this show. And I'm very curious to see what
current comics you guys are reading that you just

111
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:17,680
love right now. Pick your number one favorite and

116
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:42,860
We're recording our next episode a little bit
early because of the Easter weekend. So make sure

117
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:56,920
to get your answer in early. DC high volume Batman,
the Dark Knight's definitive DC comic stories

118
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:06,000
adapted directly for audio for the very first
time. Fear. I have to make them afraid. He's got a

119
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,940
motorcycle. Get after him or have you shot? You
mean blow up the building from this moment on. None

120
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:22,280
of your safe new episodes every Wednesday,
wherever you get your podcasts. But now it's time

121
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:28,440
to get onto the main events of this episode, where
we find out who would win in a battle between Ted

122
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:50,160
court, the blue beetle and prowler. All right,
blue beetle versus prowler. Of course, this is the

123
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:57,480
Ted cord version of blue beetle. And the fact that
we've waited until year. What is this 10 to get to

124
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:04,660
Ted cord is a travesty of justice. It is wrong, but
we're going to make it right here today. Because

125
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:13,740
Ted cord is a solid B Lister, if not a Lister of the DC
Comics Pantheon, I would say. Prowler. Not so

126
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:19,320
much. He's like a C level Spider-Man villain or I
guess a parent ally. I don't know much about him. I

127
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,400
do know that both of these characters are very tech
based. And I think that's why the executive

128
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:29,240
producers wanted to put them together. I do
remember the parlor from the 90s Spider-Man

129
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,400
television series, the cartoon. But of course, he
was also famously in the into the spider verse

130
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:40,220
film, as well as beyond the spider verse, although
that version was Miles Morales spoiler alert.

131
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,620
Yeah, there have been two prominent prowler
characters in the comics over the years. You sound

132
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:51,880
like RFK Junior, man. Okay. And one of them
obviously is Miles Morales is uncle. Correct.

133
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,980
Okay. Now, outside of the cartoons, blue beetle
hasn't had too many appearances in the media. He

134
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:02,240
was referenced in the live action blue beetle
movie, but we never actually got to see him.

135
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,220
Fingers crossed he appears in an eventual sequel.
We're going to learn more about blue beetle and

136
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:12,400
Prowler here soon. But to explain the methodology
behind our duels, let's go to our sentient dual

137
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:19,080
simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ and NK tell our
listeners how you go about determining a winner in

138
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:24,760
our dual matchups. Yes, of course, sir. The way I
determine a winner between the contestants is by

139
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:30,200
running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations using the
characters statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation

140
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,740
is a probabilistic model used to determine
outcomes through random sampling. In this case, I

141
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:39,920
randomize the statistics along a normal
distribution as a way to simulate the many

142
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,840
variables that can occur during battle. The stat
parameters are based on the official Marvel power

143
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:50,140
grid from which the DC characters statistics are
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are

144
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:55,620
included such as range, damage potential,
versatility and perception in order to create a

145
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,640
more detailed and accurate simulation. The
results of the 1000 simulations provide a

146
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,560
percentage of wins for each character. The
contestant with the higher percentage is

147
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,400
declared the victor as they have a higher
probability to win any given battle. In an

148
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:14,820
equitable pairing, neither character should win
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have

149
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:19,680
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat
Superman, so the confidence rate of my method

150
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,740
falls in line with the precedents that have been
established in the source material. My

151
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,200
mathematical simulations are without
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole

152
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:34,720
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K.

153
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,340
Before we run the simulations, though, we like to
break down each character's histories and

154
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:44,380
abilities before improvising a scenario on how we
imagine one of the 1000 simulations would play out

155
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:51,000
beat for beat. I believe it's your turn to go first,
Joseph, but since you're freaking dying, I will

156
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:59,600
read all about the prowler. Born in the Bronx as the
youngest of nine children, Hobart Hobie Brown

157
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:06,640
showed an early talent as an inventor but faced a
difficult upbringing. His father, Tiger Brown,

158
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:12,860
left the family when Hobie was a baby and later died
during military service in Cambodia. His mother,

159
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,860
overwhelmed by their responsibility, became an
alcoholic, leaving Hobie and his siblings to

160
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:23,680
raise themselves. After high school, Hobie
became a window washer to support himself despite

161
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:29,280
his engineering skills. During a job, he was
nearly killed in a battle between Stiltman and

162
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:35,220
Spider-Man. Inspired to make his window washing
job safer, Hobie designed pneumatic safety

163
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:40,900
equipment, including air pressure boots to
counter high winds, wrist-mounted sprayers, and

164
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:45,320
a safety grappling system. You can learn more
about Spider-Man and his duel against Blue

165
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:50,820
Beetle, Jaime Reyes, and more about Stiltman and
his duel against Kite Man. Hobie's inventive

166
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:57,420
ideas were rejected by his employer, who had only
hired him to meet a racial quota. After quitting,

167
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:03,320
Hobie decided to adopt the costumed identity of
the prowler, planning to a robbery and return the

168
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:07,740
stolen goods to gain publicity for his
inventions. Targeting the Daily Bugle's

169
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:13,839
payroll, he encountered Peter Parker during the
heist. In order to change into Spider-Man, Peter

170
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,680
faked being thrown out of a window, causing J.
Jonah Jameson to believe the prowler had

171
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:24,579
committed murder. Spider-Man subdued Hobie, but
realizing his intent was not malicious, let him go

172
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:29,460
with advice to change his path. Hobie took the
message to heart and abandoned his criminal

173
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:35,820
plans. Hobie soon impersonated Spider-Man at
Peter's request to help protect his identity,

174
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:40,800
wearing the costume in front of Peter's friends
while Peter pretended to be ill. Believing

175
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,020
Spider-Man was responsible for the death of
Captain George Stacey, Hobie tried to bring him to

176
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:51,380
justice but failed. Hobie later married his
longtime girlfriend, Mindy, and worked in

177
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:57,500
construction. Through the Big Brother program,
he met her young man named Manny Lopez, who was

178
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:03,080
later killed in a gang incident. Believing Hector
Ayala, the White Tiger, was responsible, Hobie

179
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,520
fought him until realizing his mistake. While
trying to join the superhero team of the

180
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,440
defenders, Hobie was thrown into the harbor by
Valkyrie and chose to retire from heroics.

181
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,020
However, his prowler equipment was stolen and
used by a second prowler to commit a murder.

182
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:24,740
Spider-Man recovered the gear and persuaded
Hobie to stay uninvolved. Hobie later resumed the

183
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:30,720
prowler identity to help clear Mindy's name after
she was framed for financial fraud. He retrieved

184
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,540
the evidence from a cellist targeted by the Black
Fox and worked with Spider-Man to clear her name.

185
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:40,920
When Spider-Man was framed for robbing a
millionaire, Hobie teamed up with several allies

186
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:46,400
including Puma, Rocket Racer, and Sandman.
Silver Sable, a mercenary from the Eastern

187
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,800
European nation of Simcaria, offered the group
further work. Hobie joined Silver Sable's

188
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,080
mercenary team called the Outlaws and
participated in missions across North America

189
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:03,780
and England, once battling Excalibur and
uncovering a rogue Arnim Zola construct. At the

190
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:09,380
time, he trained with his brother Abraham Abe
Brown, who was a martial artist and former wielder

191
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,860
of White Tiger's Jade Amulets as a member of the
Sons of the Tiger. You can learn more about Silver

192
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:20,760
Sable and White Tiger in their respective duels
against Vigilante and Bronze Tiger. Hobie teamed

193
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:26,460
up with his brother Abe to fight street crime, but
was temporarily injured battling Killer Shrike.

194
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,640
Though Hobie's wife Mindy left him after
discovering his identity, she returned when he

195
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,380
was paralyzed in a fall caused by the villain Black
Bull. While recovering, his gear was stolen

196
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:41,980
again, this time by a criminal named Rick Lawson,
who posed as the prowler until being hospitalized

197
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:47,660
by the vulture. Regaining mobility, Hobie
resumed the prowler role and aided Spider-Man

198
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:53,020
during a building fire. He provided Spider-Man
with a jet pack used during a period when Peter

199
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:57,900
adopted the Hornet persona. Hobie was arrested
during the Superhuman Registration Act

200
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:03,320
conflict, but escaped with the help of Captain
America's secret Avengers. Peter Parker later

201
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:09,360
hired Hobie to impersonate Spider-Man again to
maintain his cover. Hobie then infiltrated new U

202
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,740
technologies for Parker Industries and
discovered an experiment involving the villain

203
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:19,160
Electro, who severely injured him. He was placed
in stasis by the genetic mastermind known as the

204
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:24,200
Jackal and it was cloned. The clone served the
Jackal, while the real Hobie remained

205
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,840
unconscious in cryosleep. After being
recovered, Hobie ended his alliance with

206
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,960
Spider-Man and was hired by Tony Stark to lead a
crowdfunding firm. When the symbiote god Null

207
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:40,980
invaded Earth, Hobie adopted the identity of
Hornet and used hacked Stark Tech to repel the

208
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:47,100
symbiotes. Later, during a gang war conflict,
Hobie lent a prowler suit to a man named Aaron Davis

209
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:53,300
to investigate the villain Hobgoblin. Hobie
warned Davis that he misused the prowler suit, he

210
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:58,140
would take it back and reclaim the identity. Aaron
Davis was a former career criminal from an

211
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:04,820
alternate universe called Earth 1610, Marvel's
ultimate universe. There, Aaron was the brother

212
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:10,580
of Jefferson Davis, the father of Miles Morales.
While Jefferson reformed as a criminal and became

213
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:16,500
a police officer after marrying Rio Morales,
Aaron continued his criminal life, using stolen

214
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:23,080
tech to become the prowler. At one point, he broke
into an abandoned Oz Corp facility and knowingly

215
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,560
took a genetically altered spider with him. The
spider later bit his nephew Miles Morales, giving

216
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:33,440
him spider powers and making him the new
Spider-Man. Though Jefferson disapproved of

217
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,040
Aaron's influence, Miles maintained a close
relationship with his uncle. You can learn more

218
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:43,580
about Miles Morales Spider-Man and his duel
against Batwing. Aaron traveled to Mexico City to

219
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:49,160
confront a rival criminal known as the Scorpion,
but was arrested and returned to New York. He

220
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:54,580
attempted to manipulate Miles and to help him
eliminate the Scorpion, but Miles refused. In a

221
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:59,680
final confrontation, Aaron's gauntlets
exploded, killing him. Before dying, he

222
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,680
cryptically claimed that Miles was just like him.
After the universal incursions that led to the

223
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,160
collapse and the eventual rebirth of the
multiverse, Aaron was restored to life in

224
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:16,540
Morales' primary 616 timeline with no memory of
his death. He purchased an iron spider suit off the

225
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:22,620
black market and helped form a new Sinister 6
alongside bombshell, electro, hobgoblin,

226
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:29,000
sandman, and the spot stealing a decommissioned
shield helicarrier. Miles, who was also brought

227
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,100
into the main Marvel timeline, confronted his
uncle. And though the Sinister 6 succeeded in

228
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:39,360
their heist, Aaron appeared to die during the
ensuing battle, though he was merely injured.

229
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:48,440
Influenced by his nephew, Aaron began distancing
A villain who can learn more about his duel against

230
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,540
Blockbuster. When Miles was kidnapped by the
villain Assessor, Aaron sought help from his

231
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:58,500
estranged brother Jefferson. After
commissioning a new prowler suit from a criminal

232
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,820
weapons designer, he joined Jefferson in
infiltrating the Assessor's facility, rescuing

233
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:09,900
Miles. Later while working for the villain
Ultimatum, actually the Earth 616 variant of

234
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:16,180
Miles, Aaron attempted to assassinate a criminal
but was stopped by Spider-Man Miles. The botched

235
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:22,080
job resulted in a bounty on Aaron, which forced him
into a deal that placed him under Ultimatum's

236
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,300
control. Aaron joined his nephew Miles at the
hospital for the birth of his sister Billy, and

237
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,620
later helped resist Ultimatum's plan to return
them to their original universe. During a battle

238
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:37,680
with Ultimatum's forces, including the Green
Goblin and his Goblinoids, Aaron sacrificed

239
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:43,840
himself by overloading his suit, sending
Ultimatum and the Goblin away. Aaron was presumed

240
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:51,340
dead. In reality, Aaron awoke in an alternate
dystopian world ruled by Selim, an evil clone of

241
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:57,260
Miles Morales. Selim used Aaron's unique
dimensional signature to power a shield around

242
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:03,380
his empire. Aaron was imprisoned and used as a
living power source for decades. When Miles

243
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:08,460
arrived in the alternate dimension to rescue his
uncle, Aaron was freed and recovered enough to

244
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:15,320
fight alongside his nephew. After defeating
Selim, Aaron and Miles traveled back to Earth 616.

245
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:20,500
Upon their return was when Hobie Brown recruited
Aaron to resume the Prowler identity, tasking him

246
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:25,680
with uncovering the villain Hobgoblin's plans.
Aaron went undercover as a villain for hire and

247
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:31,120
joined Hobgoblin's crew, supplying weapons to
criminals and clashing with Miles, until his

248
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,640
cover was revealed. Aaron divulged Hobgoblin's
location and joined Miles, Miss Marvel, and

249
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,920
others to raid the villain's hideout, fighting
alongside them to bring down that criminal

250
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:46,100
empire. And that's Prowler's history.
Nobilities-wise, the Prowler has a specialized

251
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:52,280
suit made from a modified military flak jacket
that protects him from concussive forces such as

252
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:58,460
explosions or falls from great heights. It comes
with a variety of pneumatic or air-based gadgets,

253
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:04,820
including a cape that can expand, allowing him to
glide over great distances. His boots are rubber

254
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:10,500
insulated with compressed air technology that
allows him to leave multiple stories high and land

255
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:16,400
safely. His specialized gauntlets have steel
claws used for fighting and scaling buildings,

256
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,200
and they have wrist-mounted compressed air
launchers that can fire projectiles such as

257
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:27,560
grappling hooks, gas pellets, steel darts,
flares, or compressed air blasts. Prowler's suit

258
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:32,880
also comes with some stealth and infiltration
gadgets such as night vision goggles and

259
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,000
temperature control to avoid infrared
detection. Both Hobbie and Aaron are

260
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,680
intellectually gifted, one as an inventor and the
other as a thief. They're both experienced

261
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:49,760
fighters and skilled marksmen. So which version
will you be going with? I figured it could be either

262
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,000
or. If you're more of a fan of Hobbie, you can
imagine him in this fight or if you're more of a fan

263
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,340
of Aaron, who is the modern and current Prowler,
then you can imagine him in this fight. I didn't

264
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:05,740
realize he had so much compressed air like a tax.
Yeah, that's his whole thing. So does Blue Beetle.

265
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:10,580
Yeah, they have a lot in common. Interesting, I had
no idea. Well, to find out how much they have in

266
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:16,780
common, let me get into Blue Beetle Ted Kord's
backstory. Now Theodore Ted Kord was born with a

267
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:22,760
gifted intellect, excelling in science,
literature and business from a young age. While he

268
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,140
initially considered joining his father's
company, Kord Omni-Versal Research and

269
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:32,360
Development, his life changed course after
uncovering a nefarious plot by his uncle Jarvis

270
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:38,180
Kord. Discovering that Jarvis intended to
unleash an army of super androids for world

271
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:43,420
domination, Ted sought the help of his
archaeology professor, Dan Garrett, who also

272
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:49,660
happened to be the original Blue Beetle. Together
they confronted Jarvis on Pago Island, where Dan

273
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:55,020
revealed his heroic identity and used the power of
a mystical scarab he had discovered years

274
00:26:55,020 --> 00:27:01,380
earlier. In the ensuing battle, Dan was mortally
wounded. With his dying breath, Dan entrusted Ted

275
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:07,080
with the scarab and the Blue Beetle legacy. Though
Ted accepted the mantle, the scarab failed to

276
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:12,340
activate for him, refusing to give up he trained to
physical perfection, becoming a skilled

277
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:17,800
hand-to-hand combatant, and constructed a
variety of crime-fighting gadgets, including a

278
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:23,500
signature air blast pistol and a beetle-shaped
aircraft known as the Bug. Operating

279
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:30,040
independently of the scarab, Ted forged his own
identity as the second Blue Beetle. Reviving Kord

280
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:36,960
Omni-Versal, he turned the company into a major R
&D enterprise, Rivalink Star Labs. From his home

281
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:43,120
base in Chicago, he launched his career as a
costumed vigilante, taking on foes such as the Mad

282
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:49,060
Men, Carapax the Indestructible Man, and the
villainous cult known as the Men of the Mask. Ted

283
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:53,440
Kord's early career brought him into the orbit of
the world's greatest heroes when he was recruited

284
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,620
by the Monitor during the Crisis on Infinite
Earths. During the multiversal conflict, Ted

285
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:04,340
wielded the Blue Beetle Scarab to destroy shadow
demons, but later lost track of it amidst the

286
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:10,440
chaos. With the crisis resolved, Ted joined the
newly-reformed Justice League. As a founding

287
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:15,140
member of the Justice League International, Ted
served as the league's primary pilot and

288
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:19,880
technician. There he met Booster Gold, who
quickly became his closest friend and frequent

289
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,920
partner in crime-fighting and mischief. Known
collectively as Blue and Gold, the duo balanced

290
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:31,000
comic relief with critical contributions and
missions against League villains. You can learn

291
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,400
more about Booster Gold in our Booster Gold vs.
Cable dual episode. While in the league, Ted's

292
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:42,500
confidence in Wasteline began to waver due to long
hours spent in the lab. With encouragement from

293
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:47,940
teammates such as General Glory and Guy Gardner,
he regained his physical conditioning, though

294
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:53,520
not before suffering severe injuries during
battles, including a coma after Doomstay's

295
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,140
rampage. Despite these setbacks, Ted remained
active in the field, even joining the spin-off

296
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:04,960
team Extreme Justice alongside Booster and
Captain Adam, who you can learn more about in his

297
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,660
duel against Wonder Man. In time, Ted left the
league and reasserted control of Cord

298
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:17,560
Omniversal, eventually making it a subsidiary of
Wayne Enterprises. During this period, he grew

299
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:24,500
close to Barbara Gordon, aka Oracle, initially as
an online acquaintance. The two developed a deep

300
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:30,460
friendship and Ted provided her team, the Birds of
Prey, with funding and technology. You can learn

301
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:36,440
more about the Birds of Prey in our Birds of Prey vs.
A Force Team dual episode. Though he eventually

302
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:41,920
discovered he had a heart condition, Ted
continued his heroics, occasionally operating

303
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:47,800
as Blue Beetle in spite of the risk. Ted came back
into possession of Dangarit Scarab after it was

304
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:53,560
unearthed by Hawkman, though it once again
remained inert in his presence. Around the same

305
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:59,000
time, Ted noticed strange financial movements
within Cord Omniversal. Funds were being

306
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:04,400
siphoned and rerouted to mysterious shell
companies. He began investigating, only to be

307
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:10,320
attacked by a group of thugs known as the Mad Men,
severely injuring Booster in the process.

308
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:15,260
Tracing a signal hidden within his damaged
equipment, Ted uncovered the location of a secret

309
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:20,700
facility in Switzerland. There he discovered
that Maxwell Lord, one of his former League

310
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:26,580
teammates, had taken over the organization
Checkmate and intended to use the OMAC project to

311
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:32,480
neutralize the global metahuman population.
Lord offered Ted a place at his side. When Ted

312
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:39,320
refused, Max executed him with a gunshot to the
head. Ted's death shocked the hero community. A

313
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:44,820
statue was erected in his honor, and Barbara
Gordon memorialized his contributions. Though

314
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:50,420
the Scarab ultimately passed to a new host,
teenager Jaime Reyes, Ted's legacy endured

315
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:55,700
through his inventions, his friendship with
Booster Gold, and his example as a hero without

316
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:01,340
powers who stood among gods. In the wake of Ted's
death, Booster Gold and a future blue beetle

317
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:07,500
attempted to change history by rescuing him
through time travel. When they succeeded in

318
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:12,720
briefly bringing Ted forward in time, the
resulting timeline plunged Earth into a dystopia

319
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,420
ruled by OMACs, realizing the cost of his
survival, Ted returned to his original time to die

320
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:24,660
as he was meant to, thereby restoring the
timeline. During the Blackest Night, a Black

321
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:31,420
Lantern ring reanimated Ted's corpse. As a Black
Lantern, he attempted to murder Booster, Jaime,

322
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:37,100
and others, but was eventually neutralized using
technology Ted himself had designed. His remains

323
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,980
were taken to a point outside of time known as the
Vanishing Point to prevent further

324
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:48,180
resurrection. In post-flashpoint continuity,
Ted Corde reemerged, once again depicted as a

325
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:52,920
scientific, genius, and industrialist who had
retired from being blue beetle due to health

326
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:58,280
concerns. When Jaime Reyes approached him for
help in understanding the mysterious Scarab, Ted

327
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:03,380
became his reluctant mentor and benefactor.
Though Jaime initially rejected the superhero

328
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:09,060
lifestyle, Ted saw promise in him and provided
guidance, resources, and technological

329
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:15,000
support, constructing a mobile command center
and even donning his old blue beetle suit when

330
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,980
needed. Ted's investigations into the Scarab
brought him into conflict with Dr. Fate, who

331
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:26,980
declared the Scarab to be magical in origin,
contrary to Ted's belief it was alien technology.

332
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:32,880
Ted later joined a coalition of heroes including
the question Captain Adam, Nightshade, and more,

333
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,920
who traveled to Mars to confront Dr. Manhattan for
putting Superman into a coma, though Ted and the

334
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:44,640
other heroes were overpowered and scattered. You
can learn more about Dr. Manhattan in our Dr.

335
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:50,600
Manhattan vs. Molecule Man dual episode. Ted
later became a target of Black Mask, who

336
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:56,120
imprisoned him and used illusion-based powers to
impersonate him. Under Black Mask's control,

337
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,960
Corde Industries funneled resources into
illicit operations, including a revamped

338
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,780
Suicide Squad. With help from the Justice League
and an international team known as the

339
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:11,520
Revolutionaries, the real Ted was freed and
helped dismantle Black Mask's scheme. You can

340
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:17,120
learn more about Black Mask in his dual against
Madame Mask. Ted reunited with Booster Gold to

341
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:22,500
form Blue and Gold Restoration, a private hero for
higher business dedicated to helping everyday

342
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:27,760
people. Though he was ousted from Corde
Industries for mismanagement, Ted chose to keep

343
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,460
working with Booster instead of rejoining the
Justice League. Their venture faced financial

344
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:37,760
challenges, but they continued their mission,
providing aid to those overlooked by larger

345
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:44,040
organizations. Ted was briefly imprisoned by the
Batman who laughs on New Apocalypse, where he was

346
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:49,540
killed by a giant beetle during the Dark
Multiverse Crisis and resurrected via a Black

347
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:54,340
Lantern Ring. Despite these ordeals, he returned
to life once more and continued his

348
00:33:54,340 --> 00:34:00,700
crime-fighting career alongside his best friend
Booster Gold and protégé Jaime Reyes. Now,

349
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:06,300
powers-wise, Ted Corde possesses no innate
superpowers as Blue Beetle, but his genius level

350
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:11,600
intellect places him among the most brilliant
minds in the world. He's a master inventor and

351
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:17,760
engineer, creating an array of gadgets and
vehicles. His trademark weapon is the BB Gun,

352
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:22,880
capable of emitting blinding flashes or
compressed air blasts strong enough to knock back

353
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:28,480
attackers. Though he also carries smoke bombs,
acid capsules, grappling launchers, and small

354
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,199
beetle-shaped flying surveillance drones known
as baby bugs. His greatest engineering feat,

355
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:40,340
however, is the bug. An airship that can fly at 600
miles per hour, travel into outer space and

356
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:46,639
underwater, fire electromagnetic beams,
electrify its hull, shoot nets and grapples, and

357
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,120
more, all from the control of his gloves.
Physically, Blue Beetle trained to peak human

358
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:57,560
condition and was an Olympic-level acrobat and
martial artist, specializing in Akito and

359
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:02,340
karate, though his weight and physical ability
has fluctuated over the years due to his heart

360
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:07,880
condition. Thankfully, Blue Beetle's suit
slightly enhances his strength and durability,

361
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,400
while also coming equipped with suction pads that
allow him to adhere to walls and vision-enhancing

362
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:21,020
goggles. That's Blue Beetle. Is he gonna have his
bug ship during this fight? Hell yes he does! Let me

363
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:25,440
rephrase that, that wasn't a question. Blue
Beetle will not be having his bug ship during the

364
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,400
course of this fight, it's just gonna be
mono-e-mono. Do you understand? I understand

365
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:34,120
that it's something that you do not want. Thank
you. Alright. Did you see more about how similar

366
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,160
they are? Because not only do they have like
air-compressed weapons, they can also climb on

367
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:44,560
walls, one with suction cups, one with claws. They
both have like light strobes. And they both died

368
00:35:44,560 --> 00:36:44,260
like several times. Right, exactly. But now that
we've got their histories and abilities out of the

369
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:49,380
way, let's speculate on how one of the 1000
simulated matches will go. The winner is

370
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:54,560
determined by simulations, not the speculation.
But it's fun to imagine how this fight could play

371
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:01,720
out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?
Well, I should say there are no rules, other than

372
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:06,220
the characters have no prior knowledge of the
other going into the fight. All they are aware of

373
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:10,820
starting out is that the other character is a
threat that needs to be eliminated. For the

374
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:15,780
speculation, the contestants will begin
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript

375
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:20,880
environment that will have no bearing on the match
itself, as no environmental statistics are

376
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,980
considered in my simulations. The contestants
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright

377
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:32,420
then, let's get into it. Blue Beetle and a prowler
meet on the battlefield. Who goes first? I'm gonna

378
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:38,180
say that prowler goes first. He's gonna speed
blitz Blue Beetle with his claws, and before Blue

379
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:43,800
Beetle can even say, oh shit this guy is scary
fucking fast, he's just gonna get slashed across

380
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:50,980
his face. No, prowler's fast but not faster than
Blue Beetle can quick draw his BB gun and just flash

381
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:57,100
a strobe right in the guy's face so he's
disoriented and seeing spots. So with prowler

382
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:04,400
partially blinded, Blue Beetle's easily gonna
leap over his blitz and tag prowler in the back with

383
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,500
a compressed air blast that just makes him fall
flat on his face. And as he lands, as prowler is

384
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:16,580
getting up from the ground, Blue Beetle sends out a
few baby bug drones that scan the area. How big are

385
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:22,520
these drones? I've seen various sizes for these,
sometimes they're like the size of a volleyball,

386
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:28,300
but I've also seen them like the size of his palm.
Okay, prowler notices these drones as he gets to

387
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:34,840
his feet, and he's gonna shoot down a gas capsule
that creates a dark cloud of smoke around him and

388
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:39,900
it's gonna hide him from these drones and from Blue
Beetle's sight. Uh, you know, Blue Beetle's just

389
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:45,080
gonna switch the drone surveillance to infrared
so he can see prowler's heat signature with his

390
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:51,540
dope ass goggles. Except prowler is invisible to
infrared. Okay, so I don't know, Blue Beetle

391
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:56,680
switches to night vision to see through the dark
smoke and uses drones, shoot down some acid cap.

392
00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:00,480
You know, because Blue Beetle's night vision is
activated, prowler, he shoots out a magnesium

393
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,400
flare right then, and it's just gonna light up Blue
Beetle's entire view. And that's gonna

394
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:11,220
temporarily blind him. So like, as Blue Beetle's
grabbing at his goggles, prowler is gonna shoot

395
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:16,660
the bug drones out of the air with some darts by our
term as gauntlets. And then he's gonna leap out of

396
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:23,380
the smoke and just flying kick Blue Beetle right
into his beard gut. Six pack, my man. Six pack. He's

397
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:29,640
been working out. Six pack of beer. All right, so he
takes the kick, lands on his back, but he's gonna

398
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:36,080
back somersault onto his hands and knees before
launching himself with his legs back at prowler

399
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:42,660
and rocking him with a spinning back fist. He's
blind. How did he even see the prowler to hit him? I

400
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:46,840
don't know. He's, you know, he peered through the
spots in his vision. He's good like that. Well, not

401
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:53,620
good enough, because prowler blocks this hit. Oh,
it's a spinning double back fist. So when prowler

402
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:58,000
blocks one hand, Blue Beetle just spins the
opposite direction and clocks him with the other

403
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,820
hand. What? Okay, prowler gets hit, but he's gonna
counter with a spin kick and slashing uppercut

404
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:09,520
combo, followed by this like compressed air blast
from his gauntlets that just sends Blue Beetle

405
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,700
flying backward and knocking the wind out of him.
No, no, because in the middle of this combo,

406
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:20,700
suddenly prowler finds himself wrapped in a net
all around him. And as he struggles to move, he's

407
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:28,720
hoisted into the air by Blue Beetle's bug ship with
a cable that was attached to the net. I said, you're

408
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,300
making me sick here. I said, you can't use the bug
ship. I'm sorry. I thought you'd know I just

409
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:39,960
naturally use whatever Blue Beetle uses out in the
field. St. Blue Beetle can't have his bug ship is

410
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:45,580
like saying ghost writer can't have his hell cycle
or silver surfer can't have his surfboard. I doubt

411
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:50,980
that. Regardless, prowler is gonna slash his way
out of this net with his claws. And then he's gonna

412
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:56,800
glide down toward Blue Beetle, who's like, Oh,
fuck, my cheating ass is about to die. And prowler

413
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,360
lands feet first onto Blue Beetle, and he
activates his compressed air boots right as he

414
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:07,760
lands, which like a shotgun blast just explodes
Blue Beetle into a blue smear on the ground. No,

415
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,300
this net is made with metal fibers. And before
prowler could slash his way out of it, the bug ship

416
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:18,100
just sends an electric current into the net
electrocuting prowler and just sizzling him to a

417
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:23,880
crisp. Like I said, cheating ass, you can't use the
bug ship in this. I don't know what to tell you, bro.

418
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:30,620
It happened, except it. Okay, we'll go ahead and
leave the match there. Either Jonathan cheats and

419
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:36,100
the bug ship captures and electrocutes the
prowler, or he plays this like a man and prowler

420
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:41,560
just eviscerates Blue Beetle with his air
compressed boots. Hey, it takes a real man to admit

421
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:46,020
when he's defeated, Joseph. Let's go ahead and
find out who wins by inputting the stats, running

422
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:52,040
the simulations and finding out who comes out on
top. AJ9K hit it. Inputting data, running

423
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:58,280
calculations, processing results, simulations
complete. Okay, this was an awesome match. These

424
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:03,200
characters are way more similar than I would have
thought. And I kind of always love when that

425
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:09,360
happens. We just kind of serendipitously fall
into an awesome match that I never even knew I

426
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:14,200
wanted to see. Yeah, they had a lot in common,
including their invasiveness, their fighting

427
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:19,920
skill, their range, their perception. They had a
lot in common. Yeah, where Blue Beetle had the edge

428
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:26,740
was versatility. He just has more gadgets and
intelligence, but just barely. Blue Beetle did

429
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:33,140
have the edge when I came to movement speed,
because yes, I did factor the bug ship into his

430
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:37,360
stats. You cheating bastard. Well, we just
figured that a majority of the time we see the

431
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:43,500
character, whether it's in the comics or in other
media, he has his bug ship. It's a big part of who the

432
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:48,640
character is. It's like seeing Night Owl from
Watchmen without his Owl ship. And because of

433
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:54,000
that, Blue Beetle also got the edge when it came to
damage level. Yeah, the bug ship is such a big part

434
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,840
of the lore of the character that it was even
incorporated in the Blue Beetle live action

435
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:02,920
movie, even though Hymeria's doesn't use the bug
ship. Exactly. So who do you think is winning this

436
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:08,840
one, Jonathan? Is that even a question? Blue
Beetle all the way. And Instagram agrees with me,

437
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:15,980
because 69% of the people who took the poll voted
for Blue Beetle. Whoever voted for Blue Beetle in

438
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:21,520
that poll doesn't even know what a 69 is. Let's go
ahead and get the results. Hey, you are, sir. The

439
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:30,910
winner of the matchup between Blue Beetle and
prowler is, I'm so sick. Can't even say it. Blue

440
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:39,600
Beetle. Yay. Out of the 1000 matches, Blue Beetle
won 65.6% of the time. Proller only won 34.4%.

441
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:45,660
Okay, so Blue Beetle wins about two-thirds of the
time. Not quite. About two-thirds, though.

442
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:51,480
Aren't you glad that you rolled out a bed for this?
This is awesome. No. No, in fact, this whole day

443
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:59,800
just sucks. Well, sorry to add to your misery, but
also hashtag, sorry, not sorry. Let's get your ass

444
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:38,580
back in bed so you don't die. That does it for this
duel. AJ9K, help close us out. In our next episode,

445
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:44,920
we will be reviewing Daredevil born again. I have
not finished watching it, but so far, so good. That

446
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:48,840
does it for this episode. We want to give a big
thanks to our executive producers, John

450
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:12,980

possible. We'll talk to you guys next week. Up, up,

451
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:18,740
and away, true believers. Fun fact, Blue Beetle's
alternate dimension variant is called Dung

452
00:45:18,740 --> 
Beetle, who is a member of the League of Nasty
Bastards. Look it up.
