00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,340
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi and welcome
to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,600
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,140
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe, and I'm his twin

4
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:42,020
brother Johnny DC. And today you're going to hear
Bloodsport get an ass whooping by Killmonger, the

5
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:47,620
Black Panther villain, because this is gonna be
embarrassing, I think, for DC. Actually, you're

6
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:54,560
here today to witness a murder of Killmonger by
Bloodsport. T'Challa, but also the other way

7
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,900
around. Yeah, that's right, we are going to find
out who'd win in a fight between Bloodsport, the

8
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:04,620
Superman villain, I think he's mostly Superman
villain, against Killmonger, the Black Panther

9
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:09,660
villain. And who would win in a fight between
Superman and Black Panther? Superman. Easily

10
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:15,360
Black Panther, because Vibranium, obviously.
What? That's not the answer for everything,

11
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,180
Joseph. We're gonna plug in these character
stats, run simulations, and find out who'd win the

12
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,720
most out of 1,000 matches before that, though
we're gonna break down the latest comic book movie

13
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,260
news to come out this past week, of which we did get
some decent news. Finally, we got some

14
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:34,720
announcements. Yeah. We were hoping for a last
episode, specifically that the Superman movie

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:41,240
that came out this year will be releasing a sequel
in 2027, titled Man of Tomorrow. And there was also

16
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:46,600
a Marvel Zombies trailer that came out this past
week that was a whole lot of fun, definitely want to

17
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,240
talk about it. But as always, we list our segment
times in our episode description, so feel free to

18
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,820
check out the show notes if you want to skip ahead to
a particular topic. Guys, our artificially

19
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:44,540
intelligent dual simulator, AJ9K, has a quick
message for our listeners, so listen up. Thanks,

20
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:50,600
AJ9K, and thanks to everyone who supports the
show. Including our executive producer, Devin

21
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:56,800
Davis, who we forgot to wish a happy birthday last
episode because we suck, but we're gonna make that

22
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,600
right. Devin, happy birthday, man. Happy
birthday. If I could give you a gift of anything

23
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:09,540
from Marvel, I would grant you a holographic image
inducer, specifically the type that X-Men like

24
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,180
Nightcrawler used to use, because I know that
sometimes you cosplay. I feel like that would help

25
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:19,620
out with that. I'm gonna get you something way
cooler, Devin. I'm gonna get you Madame Zanadu's

26
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,360
Tarot Deck, because I know you're into the magic
side of both Marvel and DC, and I think you would

27
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,680
really like that. That is a good one. That's a good
one. It's not the better gift, but it is a good one.

28
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,780
I'll let Devin decide that. Guys, be sure to tune
into the other shows and the Dynamite Podcast

29
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:39,020
Network this week, including console, combat,
where hosts John and Dean simulate battles

30
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:43,140
between popular video game characters. In
yesterday's episode, the two determined who

31
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:49,720
would win between Heishiro Bitsuguri from Soul
Calibur and Hao Maru from Samurai Showdown. Over

32
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,780
on the Max Destruction Podcast hosts Scotty and
Gilly, pet your favorite action heroes from film

33
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,200
and television against each other. On Wednesday,
they're going to find out who would win in a fight

34
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,960
between Chase Walker from Never Back Down and Yuri
Boyka from Undisputed. On the Central World

35
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,940
Podcast hosts Zachary Hepburn speculates on
fights between fan favorite anime and manga

36
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,080
characters. In this next episode, Zach's going to
reveal who would win between Trafalgar D.

39
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:34,680
of the way, quick to the no prize. A no prize is an
award that Marvel used to give out to fans. Our

40
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,900
version, the Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital
award we post on Instagram for the person that we

41
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,780
feel gave the best answer to our question of the
week. Last week we asked who would be your number

42
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,940
one quarterback running back, wide receiver,
tight end, safety and kicker on your Marvel or DC

43
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,740
fantasy football team? Yeah, we asked that
because it's fantasy football season, the

44
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:02,400
football season is starting and there was no news
from last week. And my team sucks right now. Oh my

45
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,160
gosh, I lost my first game so bad. I won mine
actually, I got like the second highest score in

46
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:12,900
the league this week. Oh, okay. I'm happy for you,
Trafalgar. Aside of things to come in regards to

47
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,000
Bloodsport vs Killmonger perhaps. We got a few
answers. Let's go ahead and give our first

48
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,020
honorable mention to Lorenzo Valdez who said, My
team would of course be the Smallville Crows with

49
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:31,140
Whitney Fordman as quarterback, Clark Kent as
running back, Victor Stone as wide receiver,

50
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:39,480
Jason Teague as tight end, Michael John Carter as
safety and Pete Ross as kicker. Clona forever and

51
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:45,500
always, buh-bye. Okay, no surprise Lorenzo gave a
Smallville answer seemingly this is a high school

52
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,780
team. I guess considering it features a lot of high
school characters from the Smallville

53
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:57,840
television series. We've got Whitney, Lana's
boyfriend from early seasons as quarterback. You

54
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,000
got Clark himself as a running back. You've got
Cyborg on the team. You've got Jason Teague,

55
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:09,280
another romantic interest for Lana on there.
Michael John Carter is probably an older member of

56
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,380
the team, but you know, maybe he got held back a
couple of years. And of course, Pete Ross is the

57
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:19,420
kicker. Not a bad Smallville high school team. I
was going to say that they'd get their asses kicked

58
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,620
considering they are a high school team, but given
that they have Superman and Cyborg and Booster

59
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:30,140
Gold on there, they might be able to hold their own.
They're going to state. Great answer Lorenzo. Our

60
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,680
next honorable mention goes to Alex Albro who
said, Hey guys, Dr. Strange with my quarterback.

61
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,340
He's going to put the ball where it needs to be sling
ring that thing. Wolverine's my running back

62
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,300
because he's small, compact and doesn't mind head
trauma. Spider-Man's got sticky fingers. You saw

63
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,380
him in Endgame with the gauntlet. He's my wide
receiver. Hawkeye, older liable is my tight end.

64
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:51,520
Ironman with his iron legion is going to lock it
down on defense and Batrock is my kicker because

65
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,800
he's got that leg. My cheer captain's either dead
pull or black bolt. My team name is the one liners

66
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,040
because they're all good at quips and
catchphrases or because that's all black bolt

67
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,860
needs. One liners is a great name for that team, but
I thought you were going to call it sling ring that

68
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,900
thing because that was a great catchphrase. Dr.
Strange is an interesting choice for your

69
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,180
quarterback, but a valid one. I think he'd put all
kinds of magic spells on the ball or something like

70
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:18,980
that. I really like Batrock as the kicker. I'm
surprised he went with Hawkeye for the tight end. I

71
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:23,180
thought maybe he might make a good quarterback as
well. I know we didn't ask for cheer captain, but

72
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,380
the fact that you went with either dead pull or
black bolt was interesting. I definitely would go

73
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,960
dead pull in that case because I wouldn't want
black bolt to destroy the entire stadium. I also

74
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:36,380
thought Spider-Man as a wide receiver was
brilliant. Yeah, that's really good. Great

75
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:45,460
answer, Alex. Our final honorable mention goes to
Noah Terry, who said... So for my Marchman is DC

76
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:52,540
themed team, I got Superman as the quarterback,
obviously. You got Wonder Woman as the kicker, got

77
00:07:52,540 --> 00:08:01,080
Martian Manhunter as the safety. You got Shazam as
the tight end. You got the Flash as the running

78
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:10,540
back. And you got Green Lantern Hell Jordan as the
wide receiver. That's my answer. And that is a

79
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:15,900
solid DC All-Star lineup. Definitely going to the
Super Bowl. Definitely probably winning the

80
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,860
Super Bowl, if I'm being honest. It's basically
the Justice League as a football team. That being

81
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:26,000
said, Jonathan, Noah did forget to name the team.
What do you think is a good name for this team? The

82
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,460
Justice League. All right. Great answer, Noah. We
want to give a quick shout out to Travis Herndon,

83
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:35,940
who called in with his answer, but forgot to name
one of the positions. He did have a great team

84
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,360
lineup, though. That was called the NYC Chumps.
But the winner of this week's No Prize is Colby

85
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,740
Hentges, who said... My fantasy football team
would be called the Executioners. My quarterback

86
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:51,540
would be the grizzled vet with telekinesis,
Nathan Summers. My running back, the unstoppable

87
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:59,300
Kane Marco. Wide receiver, the fastest mutant on
the planet, Jean-Paul Boubert. Tied end, 9

88
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:05,060
vulnerable when he's blasted in Sam Guthrie. My
safety would be defensive coverage master Kurt

89
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:10,100
Wagner. And my kicker would be the British girl who
loves her footy Betsy Braddock. Man did this guy

90
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,400
nail the assignment. I love each and every one of
these options. If you don't know the characters by

91
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:20,700
their given names, his quarterback is Cable. His
running back is Juggernaut. His wide receiver is

92
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,700
North Star. Who's a speedster in Alpha Flight. His
tight end is Cannonball. His safety is

93
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,140
Nightcrawler. And his kicker, of course, is
Psylocke. Or Captain Britain, as she's known

94
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:35,800
currently. The Betsy Braddock version. Who's
British. Of course, the Brits love soccer. Not

95
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,480
only did he nail each position, I think, with
characters that have traits that suit the

96
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,180
position, but he also stood with a theme with
regards to the world of X-Men and adequately named

97
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:51,040
the team as the Executioners. I just thought it
worked on every level. I mean, I don't know if they

98
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,260
would beat the Justice League team, but it is a damn
good team. That Justice League team is like the

99
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:02,580
Patriots. No one wants to root for them. They're
probably cheating as well. That's fair. So great

100
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,800
answer, Colby. You win this week's No Prize. If
you, the listener, want to shout out winning your

101
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,720
own No Prize, stay tuned to later on this episode
when we'll be asking another question of the week.

102
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:23,340
And now that that's done, on to the news. So
Superman, the first film in James Gunn's DCU hit

103
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:29,540
theaters in July. And it's been an amazing success
doing incredibly well, especially at the

104
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:35,600
domestic box office. So much so that last week,
James Gunn announced another Superman film is

105
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:43,840
coming July 9th, 2027, titled Man of Tomorrow. Of
course, David Cornswet is returning as Superman,

106
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,760
as is Nicholas Holt, both of whom teased Man of
Tomorrow on their social media accounts with

107
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:56,560
images of Superman and Lex Luthor side by side.
With Lex being in his classic green war suit, which

108
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,200
is pretty awesome. I'm hoping that means we'll get
to see it in this upcoming film. I don't know if the

109
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:07,560
two characters are going to join forces against a
larger threat or what is going on, but I am

110
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,520
interested to see how their antagonistic
relationship continues to develop as this

111
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:17,620
universe progresses. Now, it seems like it's a
Superman sequel, but James Gunn is not claiming it

112
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:23,040
as a Superman sequel, correct? Well, he's
claiming it's not a direct sequel to the first

113
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:29,580
Superman movie. So I don't know if that means he's
not just continuing that story or what exactly

114
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:33,960
that means. I think he's the long clear as to what
direct sequel means as well. In fact, he said that

115
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,120
Superman 2 is a sequel to Peacemaker season 2.
Regardless, yeah, this is a sequel to the first

116
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,840
Superman movie, but I think it's going to feature a
lot more characters, or at least that's the rumor,

117
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:50,080
sort of like how Civil War was a Captain American
movie that featured a ton of other cast members. Or

118
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,740
the first Superman movie. Yeah, true, like the
Injustice Gang. Right now, the rumors are that

119
00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:00,400
John Stuart and Hawk Girl are going to play a role in
this film, but personally, I'm hoping for Batman

120
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,680
and Wonder Woman. There's not too much more to say
about this other than the release date, which is

121
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:11,280
pretty exciting, because we'll be getting a
Batman and Superman film in the same year of 2027.

122
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,820
I'm really excited to learn more about the movie as
more information comes out, including the

123
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:24,680
villain, and that brings us to our question of the
week. Who do you want the villain for Man of

124
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,760
Tomorrow to be? And why? Record your answer at

128
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:49,940
Duel No Prize that we'll post to Instagram. Be sure
to answer before September 13th. In Marvel News,

129
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:54,900
we got perhaps one of the greatest trailers that
Marvel Studios has ever put out, or Marvel

130
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:00,480
Television I guess in this case, and that is the
trailer for the upcoming Marvel Zombies animated

131
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,560
series. If you guys have not seen this yet,
definitely go on YouTube, check out the Marvel

132
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,820
Zombies official trailer. It's the one that
starts off by saying that the following is rated

133
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:17,300
TVMA before an arrow goes through the head of a
zombie. It's worth watching if you're into this

134
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:21,840
kind of stuff. It looks like it's going to be such a
good time. It looks so much cooler than I thought it

135
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:27,280
would. Marvel Zombies, that's a cool project. But
it really looks like they're going all out with the

136
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,820
violence. Like way more than they did in What If.
Right. And I don't know if it was the song choice

137
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,500
that they chose for the trailer, because I'm a big
fan of Baby Metal. It's a Japanese metal band. The

138
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:43,220
song choice was top notch. It was so good. We got to
see all kinds of characters kicking all kinds of

139
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:48,340
ass just spotting from the trailer. We know that
among the survivors of the zombie outbreak from

140
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:54,560
the What If episode is going to be Shang-Chi. I
think I saw Kate Bishop, Hawkeye. There was

141
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,040
definitely Yelena Bolova, Black Panther, and
Ant-Man. And Ms. Marvel was on there. Kamala Khan.

142
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,960
That was really interesting. We also saw
Spider-Man pull off one of the most epic zombie

143
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,760
decapitation movies of all time. And of course,
Blade. Blade was really interesting. He's not

144
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,960
going to be voiced by Mahershala Ali, but it's
really cool to see him in one of these Marvel

145
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,480
Studios properties. He's wearing Moon Knight's
outfit for some reason. That's really

146
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,680
interesting. Yeah, I didn't even realize it was
Blade initially because of the voice, I think. And

147
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:28,640
it wasn't until the very end when he was doing the
sickest swordsmanship against Ghost that I

148
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:35,260
realized, oh shit, this is Blade. Yeah, even more
than the survivors, I'm looking forward to seeing

149
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,760
the Zobified Heroes, the ones that were turned.
And of course, we saw Scarlet Witch as one of the

150
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:46,500
zombies that's a carryover from The What If Show.
We saw Captain America, Clint Barton's Hawkeye.

151
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:52,260
Saw the Abomination. That's fucking crazy as a
zombie. Namor looked really cool. They even made a

152
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:58,140
point to call him out as a zombie. And he sliced some
chick like right in half. That was nuts. Overall,

153
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:04,160
this thing is just turning out to be like a Marvel
fan and a zombies fan and even a Marvel Zombies

154
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:10,000
comic book fans dream. And while we won't be
reviewing the four episode mini series coming out

155
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,840
in a month, I will definitely be watching the hell
out of it and will most likely be giving my thoughts

156
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,480
here on this podcast. Right, we're not going to
dedicate an entire episode to the review, but I am

157
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,840
curious to hear what you think about it. Yeah, the
show starts in just a few weeks on September 24th

158
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,020
and then it's going to run each week after that.
Which is perfect and lead up to Halloween. I cannot

159
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:35,860
wait if anything this trailer shows just how cool
Marvel can be, especially when compared to the

160
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:44,080
very not cool DC Universe. Wait, what? How? Has DC
ever put out anything like this? The answer is no.

161
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,460
Case closed. I mean, there was like Constantine.
Yeah, no, sorry. Did Constantine have a baby metal

162
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:55,920
soundtrack? I rest my case. No, but it had perfect
circle. We're talking about metal, not new metal.

163
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:08,080
Okay. But that does overall the news for this
episode, so let's go ahead and move into our main

164
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:13,560
event where we find out who would win in a fight
between the Superman villain Bloodsport and the

165
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:33,700
Black Panther villain Kilmonger. Alright,
Bloodsport versus Kilmonger. I think mainly

166
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:39,320
we're doing this duel because the characters
stood out so much in their respective films that

167
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,460
they started from a few years ago. Of course,
Kilmonger was played by Michael B. Jordan in the

168
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:50,000
2018 Black Panther movie, really stood out as a
tremendous villain, probably cooler than he ever

169
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,700
was in the comics. So, you know, he's been pretty
badass in the comic books. He was just really well

170
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:59,900
adapted to screen. As was Bloodsport played by
Idris Elba in the Suicide Squad film directed by

171
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,819
James Gunn. The character is a little bit
different than that in the comics, but that was

172
00:17:04,819 --> 00:17:09,400
still a really good adaptation of the character, I
would say. Yeah, in the Suicide Squad film, the

173
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,180
character was known for having like all these
different gadgets on his person on his body suit

174
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,859
that could transform into weapons. Right. And
they also drastically altered the look of the

175
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:23,700
character from what he had in the comics at the
time, though the comics have adopted the look from

176
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:29,280
the film because it was just so cool. Like it is my
go-to skin in Fortnite. Do you have a Kilmonger

177
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,060
skin in Fortnite, Joseph? I don't, but I have a
Black Panther skin. Fake fan. Alright. Yeah, the

178
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:40,640
character of Kilmonger in the comic books has also
taken a lot of cues from the film version just

179
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,900
because it was done so successfully on the big
screen, I think. Of course, we're talking about

180
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:49,560
two characters who are heavily armed and highly
tactical. I'm really just didn't hear in how this

181
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,380
one turns out. But to explain the methodology
behind our duels, let's go to our sentient duel

182
00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:01,380
simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K tell our
listeners how you go about determining a winner in

183
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:07,260
our duel matchups. Yes, of course, sir. The way I
determine a winner between the contestants is by

184
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,320
running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations using the
character's statistics. A Monte Carlo

185
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,280
simulation is a probabilistic model used to
determine outcomes through random sampling. In

186
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,400
this case, I randomize the statistics along a
normal distribution as a way to simulate the many

187
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,340
variables that can occur during battle. The stat
parameters are based on the official Marvel power

188
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:32,620
grid from which the DC characters' statistics are
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are

189
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:38,140
included such as range, damage potential,
versatility and perception in order to create a

190
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:43,080
more detailed and accurate simulation. The
results of the 1000 simulations provide a

191
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,060
percentage of wins for each character. The
contestant with the higher percentage is

192
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,900
declared the victor as they have a higher
probability to win any given battle. In an

193
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:57,300
equitable pairing, neither character should win
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have

194
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:02,160
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat
Superman, so the confidence rate of my method

195
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,240
falls in line with the precedents that have been
established in the source material. My

196
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,700
mathematical simulations are without
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole

197
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:17,240
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K.

198
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,320
Before we run the simulations, though, we'd like
to break down each character's histories and

199
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,600
abilities before improvising a scenario on how we
imagine one of the 1000 simulations would play out

200
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,400
beat for beat. And I believe it's my turn to go first
with the DC characters' comic book backstory, so

201
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,480
let me tell you all about Bloodsport. Now, Robert
Dubois was a young man when he was drafted into the

202
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:43,860
Vietnam War. Panicked and fearing for his life,
Robert fled to Canada, leaving his younger

203
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:49,960
brother Michael, who believed in the war effort,
to assume Robert's identity at a report for duty in

204
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:55,860
his stead, intent on maintaining his brother's
integrity and clean record. Michael was deployed

205
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:01,640
to Vietnam, where he lost all four limbs in an
explosion. Overwhelmed by guilt upon hearing

206
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:06,940
what happened to Michael, Robert suffered a
mental breakdown and was institutionalized in

207
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:12,640
Canadian psychiatric facilities. Over the
years, he developed vivid combat delusions,

208
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:19,120
mentally rewriting his own cowardice into a false
past of battlefield trauma. A perfect target for

209
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:24,660
manipulation, Robert caught the attention of Lex
Luthor, who used a handler named Kimberly to

210
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:29,860
recruit and outfit Robert with a prototype
teleportation device linked directly to his

211
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:35,460
nervous system. This surgically implanted rig
allowed him to summon weapons from a hidden,

212
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:40,520
off-site arsenal instantaneously, including an
experimental rifle that fired

213
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:46,720
kryptonite-tipped projectiles. With his mind
warped and his arsenal loaded, Robert adopted the

214
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,180
codename Bloodsport and set his sights on
Superman, the symbol of the American values that

215
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:57,360
he had come to despise. You can learn more about
Superman and Lex Luthor and their respective dual

216
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,740
episodes against Dr. Doom and Baron Zemo. Robert
orchestrated a mass shooting in Metropolis to

217
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:10,120
lure Superman into battle. Disguised as a
decorated Vietnam war veteran, he opened fire in a

218
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:15,080
packed cafe, killing dozens. When Superman
intervened, Robert shot him with a

219
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:21,020
kryptonite-laced needle, forcing Superman to
retreat. The attack sent shockwaves across the

220
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:26,040
city, prompting even Lex Luthor to distance
himself from the carnage. Robert later

221
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:31,060
threatened to detonate the power source of his
teleportation rig, an act that would level 10

222
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:37,240
square miles of the city. As panic spread, Jimmy
Olsen uncovered Bloodsport's true identity and

223
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,240
tracked down his brother Michael in a veterans
hospital. Michael was brought to the scene, where

224
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,660
his presence triggered a complete emotional
collapse in Robert. Realizing the damage he'd

225
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:52,720
caused, Robert surrendered and was incarcerated
as Stryker's Island Penitentiary for the

226
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,940
criminally insane. While in prison, Robert
encountered a new inmate, Alexander Trent, a

227
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,880
white supremacist who had appropriated the
Bloodsport identity to promote his extremist

228
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:10,140
agenda, and to spite Robert due to his race. Their
feud escalated until the Warden sanctioned a

229
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:15,880
boxing match between the two, overseen by
Superman. The event erupted into a prison riot,

230
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:20,920
during which time Robert seized one of Trent's
smuggled weapons and attempted to escape. He was

231
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:26,900
shot by guards and presumed dead. Trent continued
operating under the Bloodsport name, committing

232
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,740
racially motivated terror attacks in Metropolis
and other cities, though he was eventually

233
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:37,020
defeated during a violent confrontation with
Superman and Black Lightning. During the

234
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:42,440
Salvation Run initiative when criminals were
exiled to a distant planet, a third unidentified

235
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,100
version of Bloodsport, who shared Robert's
teleportation-based weaponry with military

236
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:52,400
training, was shown to be trapped along with other
villains on an alien world. This Bloodsport

237
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,600
fought for Lex Luthor's side, though upon
returning to Earth with the other villains, he

238
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:03,000
joined Intergang before eventually being caught
by Superman. After the Flashpoint resets of DC's

239
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:09,860
continuity, Robert Devois was reimagined with a
revised history. In this continuity, he and his

240
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:14,960
brother Mickey dreamed of serving in the
military. When Mickey enlisted and was killed in

241
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,940
combat, Robert blamed the government, the war,
and the American system itself. Adopting the

242
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:26,220
Bloodsport moniker, he sought calculated
vengeance, targeting symbols of state power,

243
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:31,960
particularly Superman. Using stolen Lex Corp
technology, Robert reverse engineered a

244
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:37,620
personal teleportation rig that enabled him to
summon a high-tech arsenal mid-combat. Armed

245
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:42,020
with Kryptonite-based ammunition and
multi-dimensional weapon caches, he attacked

246
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:47,660
Superman in Metropolis and nearly defeated him
before being subdued. Robert's precision and

247
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:53,100
battlefield control made him one of Superman's
most dangerous human adversaries. After being

248
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:58,980
incarcerated at Stryker's Island, he continued
to operate as a mercenary and weapons expert. In

249
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:03,800
one mission, he joined a crew hired to capture
Solomon Grundy, resulting in a clash with

250
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:09,260
Superman and Batman. In another, he was hunted by
the Metropolis Police Department and

251
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:15,200
intercepted by speedsters Barry Allen and Wally
West during a shootout in Hub City and was soon

252
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,000
imprisoned once again. Amanda Waller eventually
recruited him into the Suicide Squad after seeing

253
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:26,460
potential in his teleportation tech and ruthless
efficiency, outfitting him with upgraded armor

254
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:32,480
and access to an expanded arsenal. His missions
escalated from standard infiltration to

255
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,260
multi-versal reconnaissance. On a mission to
Earth 3, Robert was captured and tortured by

256
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:43,640
Ultraman. After Waller dispatched the Suicide
Squad to recover him, she ensured his continued

257
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:49,160
compliance by revealing that she had embedded
explosives in every multi-versal variant of his

258
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:55,300
brother Mickey as leverage. Furious at Waller's
manipulation, Robert joined Rick Flag's rogue

259
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:01,840
squad to dismantle Waller's operation. You can
learn more about Rick Flag in our Rick Flag vs. Nick

260
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,680
Fury Duel episode. Flag's rebellion culminated
in a direct assault on the crime syndicate of Earth

261
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:13,780
3, in which Bloodsport served as Field Commander.
Under his orders, the squad ambushed Earth 3's

262
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:19,160
watchtower, disabling syndicate surveillance
and neutralizing dozens of Owlman's enforcers in

263
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,100
a coordinated strike. After Bloodsport
assassinated one of Waller's top aides during the

264
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:29,080
conflict, Waller countered by transporting
multiple versions of Mickey into the battlefield

265
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:35,040
as human shields, and Robert surrendered.
Despite the setback, he played a vital role in

266
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,180
subduing Ultraman and was returned to Earth 1
alongside the surviving multi-versal Mickey.

267
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:44,500
Following the destruction of Balrive,
Bloodsport stayed with Flag's independent

268
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:50,000
Suicide Squad. He led a covert heist against
Lexcorp and later competed in a deadly

269
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,280
underground tournament hosted by Roulette,
unknowingly facing a disguised Bruce Wayne in the

270
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,520
final round. During the battle, Wayne sabotaged
Bloodsport's teleportation link, causing

271
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:06,340
Robert to be pulled into his own weapons vault and
captured. And that's his history. Powers-wise,

272
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:12,020
Bloodsport possesses no innate superpowers, but
his combat training and tactics combined with his

273
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:19,950
teleportation... His cybernetic teleportation
rig is connected to an extra-dimensional weapon

274
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:26,290
cache, allowing him to summon a wide array of
firearms like energy rifles and heavy ordnance,

275
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:32,490
explosives, and specialized tools such as
shields and jetpacks in the middle of combat.

276
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:37,790
Robert is a master marksman and ambidextrous
shooter capable of switching weapons or hands

277
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:42,130
without compromising accuracy. His suit
provides ballistic protection and

278
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:47,430
modifications to with sand hostile alien
environments. And that's Bloodsport. So

279
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:54,390
Superman oversaw a boxing match between two
prisoners, one of them being a black man and the

280
00:26:54,390 --> 00:27:02,250
other being a white supremacist? How is that okay?
You know, I don't have an answer. Jesus. That was

281
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:07,690
one of the weirdest things I think I've ever heard
in these backstories. I know, right? I didn't know

282
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:12,850
that he could teleport. So he can't teleport, like
physically, his whole body, he could just

283
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:17,650
teleport weapons. I mean, he can teleport, but
it's only to like retreat back to his weapons

284
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:22,510
vault. He can't teleport to like various
locations in the battlefield. Oh, okay. All

285
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:26,530
right, that's good to know. So it's like an
instantaneous teleportation to his cache and

286
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:31,550
then back to the very spot that he left from. Uh, no,
no, he teleports the weapons themselves. He

287
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:36,850
doesn't teleport. Oh, I thought you just said that
he could teleport to his weapons cache. You asked

288
00:27:36,850 --> 00:27:41,670
me if he could teleport and I'm saying if he did, it
would just be to his cache. He wouldn't be able to

289
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:46,830
teleport back to the battlefield. Oh, I see. I see.
So if I understand this correctly, the

290
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:51,630
teleportation technology he has does not
actually move his physical body unless he's

291
00:27:51,630 --> 00:27:58,010
retreating, but instead teleports the weapons
that he employs in battle. Exactly. It teleports

292
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:02,390
the weapons to him. So what if he doesn't have
anything in his weapons cache? What if he just has

293
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:09,410
like a pea shooter? Oh, he's got a ton of stuff in his
weapons cache, like multi-dimensional scary

294
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:15,190
stuff. Killmonger's dead. That is a scared
Killmonger. Not yet. If Black Panther doesn't

295
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:21,790
scare him, nothing will. Okay, let me tell you
about Killmonger, whose real name is Njeraka.

296
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:28,770
Njeraka was born in the African country of Wakanda
to Njobu, a warrior of royal descent. His early

297
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:34,610
life was marked by tragedy when a fellow Wakandan
named Ndemue betrayed the nation to the mercenary

298
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:40,590
Ulysses Kla, whom you can learn more about in our
LifeWire vs. Kla duel episode. During Kla's

299
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:46,190
incursion into Wakanda to steal vibranium,
Njeraka's parents were killed and the boy was

300
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:51,870
taken captive. Ndemue acted as his custodian
while serving as Kla's accomplice, but treated

301
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:57,570
the child cruelly and convinced him that Wakanda
had abandoned him. Kla forced Njeraka to renounce

302
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:03,970
his name and take on the identity of Eric, claiming
the world had no place for him. For years, Eric was

303
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:09,910
raised in servitude, building devices for Kla's
band of raiders while being told he had no home. His

304
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:15,410
resentment grew until he finally killed Ndemue
and severed ties with his captors. Reluctant to

305
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:21,130
return to Wakanda, he settled in Harlem, New York.
There, he pursued education, proving himself a

306
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:26,430
gifted intellect. He excelled academically,
earning degrees in business, engineering a PhD in

307
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:31,150
Neural Science, and a master's degree from MIT.
Despite his accomplishments, his hatred

308
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:36,450
remained fixed on Kla and Wakanda's monarchy,
whom he believed responsible for his parents'

309
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:41,710
deaths and his abandonment. In New York, Eric
attempted to assassinate Kla, but the mercenary

310
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:46,350
was protected by Wilson Fisk, the kingpin of
crime, whom you can learn more about in his duel

311
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:51,090
against the penguin. Killmonger infiltrated the
kingpin's crime ring, however his defiance and

312
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:56,330
obsession with vengeance against Kla alienated
him from others in the crew. When kingpin betrayed

313
00:29:56,330 --> 00:30:01,330
the group by sending bullseye after them to
eliminate loose ends, the crew disbanded. During

314
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:06,890
this time, Eric began hearing the voice of a
goddess. He first believed it was Bast, the

315
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:12,890
Wakandan panther god, but it was later revealed to
be another deity that spoke to him, Kyliluna, the

316
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:18,310
goddess of war, and a fallen sister of Bast who was
long ago banished from Wakandan worship.

317
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:23,490
Kyliluna encouraged him to embrace rage and
bloodshed and to take on the name Killmonger.

318
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:28,310
Killmonger's bitterness deepened. He secretly
obtained intelligence on Wakanda through the

319
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:33,510
International Espionage Organization Shield
and vanished, determined to bite his time until he

320
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:37,910
could exact vengeance on his homeland. Years
later, when T'Challa announced that Wakanda

321
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:43,170
would open itself to the outside world,
Killmonger used the opportunity to return. He

322
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:48,530
presented himself as a grateful exile, eager to
come home, but inwardly he still seethed with

323
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:53,350
anger. Secretly, he began plotting to overthrow
the throne. You can learn more about T'Challa, the

324
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:58,070
Black Panther, in his duel against Black Manta.
Killmonger's schemes centered around a

325
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:03,330
vibranium shock bomb meant as a deterrent against
colonizers. He murdered fellow Wakandan

326
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:08,510
refugees using their deaths as experiments with
neuropsychic weaponry while preparing to frame

327
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:14,390
Wakanda as aggressors. His plan was to drop the
bomb on a shield helicarrier, forcing Wakanda

328
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:19,350
into global war and destabilizing Black
Panther's rule. T'Challa confronted him, and

329
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:23,850
with his sister Shuri's aid, the Black Panther was
able to foil the plan. You can learn more about

330
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:29,750
Shuri in her duel against Aqualath. Rather than be
captured, Killmonger leapt from a plane into a

331
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:34,490
lake, disappearing once again. He resurfaced
later in Wakanda, taking advantage of Black

332
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:39,550
Panther's absences with the Avengers to stage
rebellions. He gathered lieutenants such as

333
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:45,390
Baron Makob, King Kedavre, and Salamander Krule,
building an army known as the Death Regiment. He

334
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:50,090
manipulated unrest among Wakandans who were
dissatisfied with their king's global focus.

335
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:55,890
With this army, he attacked the royal palace and
battled Black Panther at warrior falls. He nearly

336
00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:00,670
won, hoisting T'Challa's body over the
precipice, but he was pushed to his death by a boy

337
00:32:00,670 --> 00:32:05,790
whose father had been slain by Killmonger's men.
His dead body was found by a mysterious Wakandan

338
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:10,570
woman who helped preserve it with herbs. Later,
the villain known as the Mandarin resurrected

339
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:16,150
Killmonger using Wakanda's resurrection altar
and one of his mystical rings. You can learn more

340
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:20,070
about the Mandarin in his duel against
Abracadabra. Killmonger allied with the

341
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:24,710
Mandarin in a plan to transmute Wakanda's
vibranium into Antarctic vibranium, which

342
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:29,670
vibrates at a frequency capable of dissolving
other metals. Black Panther and Iron Man foiled

343
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:34,410
the scheme, and when the Mandarin withdrew his
power, Killmonger's body crumbled into a

344
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:39,510
skeleton. Yet this was not the end. Killmonger's
loyal followers later sacrificed themselves at

345
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:44,150
the resurrection altar to restore him again.
Reborn, Killmonger attempted to undermine

346
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:48,810
Wakanda's economy by destroying T'Challa's
reputation abroad. He recruited allies

347
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:54,450
including Hydroman and Nightshade while
manipulating N'Kia, a former Dora Milaje, into

348
00:32:54,450 --> 00:32:58,990
becoming the villain, Malice. When economic
sabotage failed, Killmonger challenged

349
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:04,890
T'Challa in a ritual combat for the throne. This
time, he triumphed, becoming King of Wakanda and

350
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:09,870
assuming the mantle of Black Panther. He even
attempted to join the Avengers into T'Challa's

351
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:14,290
place, but when he consumed the sacred
heart-shaped herb that gave the Black Panther his

352
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:19,690
abilities, his body reacted violently. The
herb's properties were poisonous to those

353
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:25,050
outside the royal bloodline, leaving him
comatose. And a quick side note, I know that I said

354
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:30,030
that his father was of royal descent, but the only
thing that I could think of is that the writer of

355
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:35,390
that story forgot, and maybe Killmonger was just
outside where he needed to be on the royal family

356
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:42,370
tree. Marvel. Shut up. Though T'Challa could have
left Killmonger to die, he kept him alive.

357
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:47,030
Eventually, Eric awakened and left Wakanda,
traveling to New York where he encountered Casper

358
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:52,630
Kohl, a police officer who donned an old Black
Panther suit to fight crime. Kohl offered him a

359
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:57,070
synthetic version of the heart-shaped herb,
hoping to bind Kohl to him as an ally in the Panther

360
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:01,510
cult. Kohl accepted the herb but chose
independence, and instead of owing Killmonger

361
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:06,090
allegiance, he took up the identity of the White
Tiger. A mantle that has passed through several

362
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:11,010
heroes that you can learn more about in our Bronze
Tiger vs White Tiger duel episode. Killmonger

363
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:16,389
later allied with the US government, who saw him as
a potential means of destabilizing Wakanda. With

364
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:21,670
their backing, Killmonger conquered Wakanda's
neighbor, Nyganda, and proclaimed himself as its

365
00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:28,250
ruler. He captured Shuri and Monaco Rambo, aka
Photon, or Spectrum I like to call her Photon,

366
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:33,889
forcing Wakanda into conflict. In battle, he
fought Black Panther once again, with both of them

367
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:38,489
wearing advanced suits of armor. Killmonger
gained the upper hand, but Photon freed herself

368
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:44,110
and struck him at light speed, killing him. His son
witnessed the event and swore vengeance against

369
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:49,650
T'Challa. However, even this death was not the end
for Killmonger. While dead, Wakanda began

370
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:55,130
exploring the stars, searching for the source of
the meteor that struck Earth millennia ago and

371
00:34:55,130 --> 00:35:00,250
formed the Great Mound Vibranium deposit that
Wakanda was built upon. The explorers traveled

372
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:04,930
through a temporal anomaly that brought them back
in time to the vast reaches of space, and they began

373
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:10,010
settling on habitable planets, making Wakanda
the first large-scale human intergalactic

374
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:15,830
empire. From one of the colonies came a new
Injadaka, named after Killmonger's birth name.

375
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:21,510
He rose to power and became a tyrant over the
colonies, becoming a host to a Klingtar symbiote.

376
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:26,070
You can learn more about the parasitic Klingtar
symbiotes in our Clayface vs. Venom duel episode.

377
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:31,490
Eventually, this Injadaka and the intergalactic
empire traveled to Earth in an attempt to invade

378
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:36,470
and overthrow what they called Wakanda Prime in
Africa. When they were stopped by the Black

379
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:41,610
Panther and Injadaka was killed, his symbiote was
placed on Killmonger's corpse on their

380
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:46,710
resurrection altar. The ritual succeeded in
reviving Killmonger but created a struggle

381
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:51,870
between his soul and that of the intergalactic
tyrant for control of their shared body.

382
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:57,210
Together, they returned to space and commanded
immense armies in symbiotic power, waging war

383
00:35:57,210 --> 00:36:02,770
across galaxies. Yet their internal conflict
weakened them. When confronted by T'Challa in a

384
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:08,150
final battle, he was able to strike a killing blow,
ending Killmonger's threat once more. And that's

385
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:13,050
Killmonger's backstory. Powers-wise, I'm not
going with the recent symbiote-enhanced Eric

386
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:18,150
Killmonger. I'll be going with the traditional
mercenary slash warlord Killmonger,

387
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:22,610
specifically the one wearing the suit from the
Back to Africa story arc from Black Panther Volume

388
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:28,490
4. Though the heart-shaped herb was poisonous to
him, it did also enhance its natural physicality

389
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:33,770
in the same way it affected T'Challa and his royal
ancestors. This means he is in peak human physical

390
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:39,410
condition, including his speed, stamina,
strength, reflexes, agility, and durability. He

391
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:45,330
has enhanced senses, is a master martial artist,
and expert strategist. Killmonger is an expert in

392
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:50,310
neural science, having engineered electrode
gadgets that can extract information from or

393
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:55,870
paralyze the human brain, as well as devices that
can command animal life, including a pair of

394
00:36:55,870 --> 00:37:00,990
trained leopards. He is also a gifted chemist,
having developed a non-poisonous synthetic

395
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:07,410
version of the heart-shaped herb and various
toxins. He has worn body armor, not a full suit like

396
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:12,150
the Black Panther habit, but a vibranium chest
plate with pauldrons on the shoulders and face

397
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:18,110
mask. He also wears vibranium bracers with
poisonous spikes, hidden blades, concussive

398
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:24,510
energy blasters, and communication devices. For
this matchup, he'll also have a vibranium

399
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:31,690
Wakandan spear and short sword. But does he have an
entire arsenal cash at his disposal? He has an

400
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:37,810
entire arsenal on his person. Not enough. It's not
going to be enough. It will be enough because while

401
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:44,170
Bloodsport's running around, being all
ineffective, he's just going to get got. Get gatt.

402
00:37:44,170 --> 00:38:44,110
We'll see. Apparently, this guy dies all the time.
So, damn it. But now that we've got their histories

403
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:49,750
and abilities out of the way, let's speculate on
how one of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The

404
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:54,410
winner is determined by simulations, not this
speculation, but it's fun to imagine how the fight

405
00:38:54,410 --> 00:39:00,590
could play out. AG9K, what are the rules of our
speculation? Well, I should say there are no

406
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:05,570
rules, other than the characters have no prior
knowledge of the other going into the fight. All

407
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:10,130
they are aware of starting out is that the other
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.

408
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:15,910
For the speculation, the contestants will begin
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript

409
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:20,970
environment that will have no bearing on the match
itself, as no environmental statistics are

410
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:26,170
considered in my simulations. The contestants
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright,

411
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:31,530
then let's get into it. Bloodsport and Killmonger
meet on the battlefield? Who goes first?

412
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:38,670
Bloodsport is pretty calculating, so I'll say he
starts off by summoning a sniper rifle with an

413
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:46,290
X-ray scope and he's gonna target Killmonger's
heart, just dead center and fire around. I mean,

414
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:51,070
Bloodsport is not more calculating than
Killmonger, but we'll give you this first shot.

415
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:55,910
The bullet hits Killmonger in the chest, but the
funny thing about a vibranium chest plate is that

416
00:39:55,910 --> 00:40:01,850
it's gonna absorb any force directed against it,
so that bullet just felt like a cotton ball to

417
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:08,110
Killmonger, who's probably like surprised that
the guy got a shot off, but he's gonna retaliate by

418
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:15,050
firing two concussive force blasts from his
Wakandan spear at Bloodsport. One of the blasts is

419
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:19,750
to knock the rifle out of his hand, and the other
blast is to knock him on his ass. Okay, I mean, the

420
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:25,410
funny thing about an extra-dimensional,
multiversal weapons cache, though, is that you

421
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:31,470
never quite know what Bloodsport is going to
summon from it, and this rifle actually fired a

422
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:37,490
spider drone onto Killmonger, not an actual
round. So while Bloodsport is dodging

423
00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:44,670
Killmonger's force blasts, that spider drone is
gonna crawl down Killmonger's arm onto his spear,

424
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:49,590
at which point it's gonna explode. Just detonate
this powerful explosion, and that's gonna send

425
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:55,310
his spear flying far away from him. Wait, so you're
telling me that this spider drone that Bloodsport

426
00:40:55,310 --> 00:41:01,590
shot onto Killmonger could have detonated on
Killmonger's head, but instead why did it choose

427
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:09,630
to blow up the spear? Fuck. What a dunce. That
spider's stupid. I'm gonna say that the spider

428
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:14,550
drone didn't even make it to the spear, because it
got impaled on one of Killmonger's spikes that he

429
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:19,990
has on his arm bracers. Okay, but Killmonger's
going to quickly recognize that Bloodsport is

430
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:25,430
like a marksman, so he's gonna be strategic and try
to close the distance between the two. So he's

431
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:31,370
gonna sprint, he's gonna blitz Bloodsport, and
hurl his Wakandan warblade at him, which is like

432
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:37,230
this machete weapon, and it takes off one of
Bloodsport's hands. Okay, well, I'm assuming

433
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:44,710
this warblade is vibranium? Fuck yeah it is. Of
course it's vibranium. Okay, so while Killmonger

434
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:50,730
is charging towards Bloodsport, Bloodsport has
seen the metallic armor and weaponry that

435
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:57,430
Killmonger has, so he's gonna summon a magnetic
mine launcher, and he's gonna fire a mine between

436
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:04,050
him and Killmonger, and that mine's gonna attract
Killmonger's sword just straight down onto it, as

437
00:42:04,050 --> 00:42:09,630
well as Killmonger himself as he nears it, and he's
just gonna plant face first straight onto that

438
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:15,510
mine, which Bloodsport is then gonna detonate. So
there's your face explosion. You happy? No,

439
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:22,350
because if Bloodsport activated this magnetic
mine, then the sword that Killmonger threw would

440
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:26,870
have been pulled into it first, and it would have
just sliced right through it and disabled it. So

441
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:33,250
that did nothing. Killmonger picks up the blade as
he continues sprinting toward Bloodsport, and he

442
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:38,630
closes the distance and just straight up spears
and impales Bloodsport right through the chest.

443
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:44,370
Except blam! Electrified net launcher, just as
Killmonger reaches Bloodsport. So now

444
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:49,470
Killmonger's trapped on the ground, being
electrocuted, and that's when Bloodsport

445
00:42:49,470 --> 00:42:55,810
summons a 44 magnum revolver and just gives
Killmonger a fatal dose of lead poisoning right

446
00:42:55,810 --> 00:43:01,530
there on the ground. I mean, with how fast
Killmonger closed the distance while sprinting,

447
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:06,750
I don't think Bloodsport would have had time to
summon and fire a net launcher, but say grant you

448
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:12,850
that Bloodsport fired the net. Like how's it gonna
get past the spear that Killmonger is swiping at

449
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:18,490
him, right? The net's just gonna get all caught and
twisted in the spear, so Killmonger discards it,

450
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:23,890
tossing it to the ground, and without missing a
beat, crouches, knee slides past Bloodsport and

451
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:29,590
slashes his Achilles tendons on his ankles, which
drops him to his knees. Okay, except Bloodsport

452
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:36,570
just fucking hopped into the air as Killmonger
slides past him, and while in mid-air, he's gonna

453
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:43,950
summon a Thunderbuster 2000X, which fires around
every millisecond. No way Killmonger can dodge

454
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:50,110
that, even sliding on the ground, so he just gets
riddled with bullets from behind. I mean, the gun

455
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:57,890
may shoot fast, but it doesn't make Bloodsport
fast. Like recognizing that Bloodsport left over

456
00:43:57,890 --> 00:44:03,450
his slash attack and is now drawing a gun on him,
Killmonger's gonna slash with his Wakandan

457
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:08,990
Warblade at the gun's barrel, which is just gonna
cleave it in two. So yeah, this gun fires around

458
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:14,590
every millisecond, more like backfires every
millisecond, which is gonna destroy that gun, and

459
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:20,050
probably Bloodsport's hands when it explodes in
his grasp. And at that point, Killmonger is gonna

460
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:25,630
press the advantage, he's gonna slap a neural
device on Bloodsport's head that's gonna

461
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:31,070
infiltrate his mask. I don't know how, but it did
infiltrate Black Panther's mask, okay? And it

462
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:37,390
paralyzes him with this searing pain, and while
Bloodsport's like struggling, Killmonger does a

463
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:43,250
neural extraction using the device and gets
Bloodsport to tell him where these weapons are

464
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:48,150
coming from. And once he finds out it's through
teleportation, Killmonger ganks his teleporter

465
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:54,210
and then just fries Bloodsport's brain with the
neural device. So the match is over. Okay, way too

466
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:58,890
many moves. I mean, if a gun explodes in your hand
and then you get paralyzed with a neural

467
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:05,310
electrode, I'd say Killmonger gets all the moves
he wants. First of all, Bloodsport is

468
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:11,010
ambidextrous and was holding the Thunderbuster
with one hand, so he still has his other one, you

469
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:17,850
know? Second, Bloodsport wears a fucking helmet,
not a mask. So even if the neural device manages to

470
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:23,490
connect with his neural network, it's a weak
connection. So the pain isn't as strong as you

471
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:30,550
think. And that's gonna give Bloodsport enough
leeway to summon a giant fucking laser cannon

472
00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:36,730
while Killmonger is asking him dumb questions. So
Bloodsport blasts Killmonger apart, leaving

473
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:43,370
nothing but bones and some vibranium armor and
weapons, which are now gonna go on Bloodsport's

474
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:49,930
weapons cache. So match is really over now. No,
Killmonger has enhanced senses. Like if he sees

475
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:55,510
Bloodsport is reaching for a gun during his
interrogation, he's just gonna straight up blast

476
00:45:55,510 --> 00:46:00,470
the dude's head off with one of his wrist mounted
force blasters. What do you mean reaching for a

477
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:06,810
gun? Bloodsport doesn't reach for guns. They
materialize in his hands. I said raising his gun.

478
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:13,450
If he sees him raising his gun. If he sees him
raising a gun, it's already too late. Yeah, for

479
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:19,690
Bloodsport, because Killmonger blasts his head
off. No, no. Killmonger is disintegrated. That's

480
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:25,810
how it ends. Well, let's see which of those cases is
true by running the simulations. It's a quick draw

481
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:33,110
situation, I guess. Either Bloodsport manages to
blast Killmonger with this energy cannon, or he's

482
00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:38,930
too paralyzed from the neural device to move
quickly enough and Killmonger notices and blasts

483
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:44,310
him before he gets blasted. Let's go ahead and
input the stats, run the sims, and come back with a

484
00:46:44,310 --> 00:46:51,570
winner. AG9K, hit it! Inputting data, running
calculations, processing results, simulations

485
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:56,290
complete. Alright, this is a damn good matchup.
These guys went back and forth on a lot of the stats,

486
00:46:56,290 --> 00:47:00,750
but they were like close on a lot of the stats too.
Yeah, I'm kind of getting a flashback to last week

487
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:05,730
where they kind of played a tit for a tat with each of
these stats. We said that they were equal when it

488
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:11,710
came to movement speed and evasiveness, but we
also said that Bloodsport was more durable, he

489
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:18,230
could inflict more damage, he had a greater range
and was more versatile. Yeah, whereas Killmonger

490
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:23,250
is stronger than Bloodsport having ingested the
heart-shaped herb, we also said he's a better

491
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:29,410
fighter, barely, is definitely smarter though,
and has enhanced perception due to his increased

492
00:47:29,410 --> 00:47:35,090
senses. Yeah, the intelligence stat was actually
the greatest discrepancy between the two. Right,

493
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:41,210
because not only has Killmonger overthrown an
entire nation, he's also like a master engineer,

494
00:47:41,210 --> 00:47:46,070
neuroscientist, and chemist. Whereas
Bloodsport's crazy. Yeah, and most iterations of

495
00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:51,630
the character Bloodsport is mentally unstable.
But taking all of these stats into consideration,

496
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:56,890
Joseph, who do you think came out on top? This is
going to be close, actually. So the Bloodsport's

497
00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:02,470
better than Killmonger in a lot of places where it
counts. I do think Killmonger would be able to

498
00:48:02,470 --> 00:48:07,750
outsmart Bloodsport, but yeah, I think it's going
to be close. I'm going to root for Killmonger

499
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:14,310
though. Instagram is siding with DC. Again, as
always, 56% of the poll takers are siding with

500
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:21,070
Bloodsport. They sided with Marvel last week, did
they? Yeah. Oh, I don't know, it hurts more when

501
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:25,890
they side with DC, so it feels like they're always
against me. Well, let's see if they chose

502
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:33,250
correctly this time. AJ9K, the results, please.
Hey, you are, sir. The winner of the matchup

503
00:48:33,250 --> 00:48:44,470
between Bloodsport and Killmonger is
Killmonger. Hell yeah, hell yeah. Finally.

504
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:54,090
Finally. Which, damn it. Killmonger won 524 of the
1000 matches or 52.4% compared to Bloodsport who

505
00:48:54,090 --> 00:49:02,210
won 47.6% of the time. So it was a close, close
match. I mean, Bloodsport has better gadgets and

506
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:06,190
gear, right? But Killmonger's no slouch in that
department. He has a lot of gadgets and gear

507
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:12,770
himself, but he also has the enhanced physicals
and the smarts, I think, that overpowered

508
00:49:12,770 --> 00:49:19,570
Bloodsport. And that's pretty much exactly why he
won. In the areas where Bloodsport was better, he

509
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:25,210
was just barely better. And in the areas where
Killmonger was better, it was by a little bit more

510
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:31,190
like intelligent. Close match, though. Yeah,
yeah, really close. I'm kind of sad I lost this one.

511
00:49:31,190 --> 00:49:37,130
Bloodsport's powers are pretty damn cool. Like if
I could have a superpower, I think Bloodsport's

512
00:49:37,130 --> 00:49:42,350
would be pretty awesome. That is a cool power, sir.
Yeah, I like it more than what they did in the

513
00:49:42,350 --> 00:49:47,310
Suicide Squad movie, where every weapon of his was
just kind of part of his suit. I mean, that was a

514
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:53,810
great way to ground his ability in the movie. But
the idea of him being able to teleport any weapon

515
00:49:53,810 --> 00:50:00,270
from his cash into his hand, I think, is even
niftier. Well, Bloodsport had a suit similar to

516
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:06,510
that, a different design. It was created for him by
Lex Luthor, where he could pull different nano

517
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:11,570
weapons off of his armor. Interesting. He used it
against Superboy, but yeah, I prefer the

518
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:16,030
teleportation. What would be an interesting
fight is the movie versions of these characters

519
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:21,370
where we have Killmonger wearing the Black
Panther habit, going against Bloodsport wearing

520
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:26,490
his nanotech suit. We didn't end up doing that for
this matchup because we're going with the comic

521
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:31,210
book versions, as always, but maybe that might be a
good option for the Max Destruction podcast down

522
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:35,630
the line. Oh yeah, I'm down for that. That'd be
really cool. Maybe Bloodsport could get his

523
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:41,550
revenge. Or Marvel could win twice, which is twice
as nice. Honestly, I don't see Marvel losing

524
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:46,750
another duel matchup after this one. I think we're
going to go on a streak for the rest of the year,

525
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:51,290
leading up to January and the end of this podcast,
and it feels good feeling that confident right

526
00:50:51,290 --> 00:50:55,870
now. Are you just saying that because I said that?
No, but it's easy to say things like that when

527
00:50:55,870 --> 00:51:01,090
you're riding high off of a win. Pride comeeth
before the fall, my friend. Trust me, I speak from

528
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:39,190
experience. But that does it for this duel. AJ9K
help close us out. Our next episode is going to be a

529
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:45,090
team duel where we find out who would win in a fight
between the Legion of Superheros and the new

530
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:52,070
mutants. It's going to be a good one. I kind of think
it's lopsided, but I guess we'll find out. But that

531
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:56,090
does it for this episode. We want to give a big
thanks to our executive producers, John

532
00:51:56,090 --> 00:52:00,530

possible. We'll talk to you guys next week. Up, up

536
00:52:15,290 --> 00:52:16,290
and away, true believers.
