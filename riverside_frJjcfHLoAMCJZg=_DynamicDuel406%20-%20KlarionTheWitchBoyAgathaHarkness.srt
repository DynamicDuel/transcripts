This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,398 --> 00:00:29,620
And welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:35,302
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:35,723 --> 00:00:43,066
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous
Joe. And in this episode, we are doing a spooktacular

5
00:00:43,106 --> 00:00:50,009
duel between two witch characters, Clarion the
Witch Boy from DC and Agatha Harkness from

6
00:00:50,089 --> 00:00:56,359
Marvel. who currently of course has her own
series on Disney Plus, Agatha All Along. Yeah,

7
00:00:56,439 --> 00:01:00,560
I haven't started watching it yet. I'm hoping
to binge it right before Halloween, because

8
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,541
it feels very Halloween-y and I don't want to
wait week to week, basically. Well, hopefully

9
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:09,043
this episode will help people get in the Halloween
spirit, but before we get into the duel, we're

10
00:01:09,063 --> 00:01:12,764
going to break down the comic book movie news
from the past week, of which there's really

11
00:01:12,784 --> 00:01:18,045
just one news item, and that was that Aaron
Pierre has been cast as Jon Stewart in the

12
00:01:18,085 --> 00:01:22,457
Green Lantern series. As always, we list our
segment times in our episode description, so

out of the way, quick to the No Prize! A No

33
00:03:12,164 --> 00:03:16,471
Prize is an award Marvel used to give out to
fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel No Prize,

34
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:21,034
is a digital award we post on Instagram for
the person that we feel gave the best answer

35
00:03:21,074 --> 00:03:25,957
to our question of the week. Last week we asked
you guys, who's your favorite Robin character

36
00:03:25,977 --> 00:03:31,841
from the comics, and why? We got a lot of answers,
8 in total, but only 3 got an honorable mention,

37
00:03:32,202 --> 00:03:35,904
and there was one No Prize winner, so let's
go ahead and run those down. Our first honorable

38
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:38,826
mention goes to Mason Thompson, who said,

39
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:49,009
So I'll pull from the main selection. I'm gonna
go with Jason, you know He went from people

40
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:55,834
wanting to vote him to get killed off To him
coming back and he's popular in the main media

41
00:03:55,954 --> 00:04:00,797
and he's a fan favorite I mean, that's just
an insane comeback to not choose him He has

42
00:04:00,837 --> 00:04:06,741
so much depth to him and feel just with Bruce
and his connection So yeah, give me Jason is

43
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:12,485
the best Robin. Yeah, Jason Todd has one of
the most interesting Backstories of a comic

44
00:04:12,505 --> 00:04:17,744
book character ever. Fans initially hated him,
like Mason said. They voted for the character

45
00:04:17,804 --> 00:04:24,648
to die decades ago. Although that wasn't really
true. Yeah, actually one guy used a speed dialer

46
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:29,491
to vote way more times than anyone else, so
it was kind of rigged. But, you know, for the

47
00:04:29,511 --> 00:04:36,535
character to come back and be arguably the coolest
Robin as Red Hood is quite the character arc.

48
00:04:36,895 --> 00:04:40,297
Yeah, he had a lot of attitude as a Robin, which
I think a lot of people didn't like, but...

49
00:04:40,618 --> 00:04:44,659
It makes sense to parlay that attitude into
more of a badass character in the Bat Family.

50
00:04:44,899 --> 00:04:48,621
And he has a really cool look to him too, so.
Yeah, absolutely. Of course, if you want to

51
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:52,883
learn more about Jason Todd, we put him in one
of our duel episodes against the Punisher.

52
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:59,385
Great answer Mason! Our next honorable mention
goes to Travis Herndon, who said, What's up

53
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:04,027
dynamic dudes? Travis here. Shout out to my
evil twin. So my pick would have to be Duke

54
00:05:04,167 --> 00:05:11,522
Thomas. Now I know he wasn't exactly chosen
by Bruce. to be the new Robin it was Alfred

55
00:05:11,562 --> 00:05:17,144
but Alfred is Bruce's second in command and
I think Duke is pretty cool Robin at the time

56
00:05:17,264 --> 00:05:22,045
and very underrated compared to like all the
rest of the other bat family so yeah my answer

57
00:05:22,065 --> 00:05:27,046
would be Duke Thomas that's my favorite Robin.
Yeah Duke Thomas was a character who came around

58
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:33,668
during a time when Batman Bruce Wayne was dead
but he quickly emerged as a pretty popular

59
00:05:33,728 --> 00:05:39,710
teenage hero within Gotham of course he was
never officially a Robin. but he is still a

60
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:44,774
part of the Bat Family as the character of Signal,
Gotham's daytime protector, considering that

61
00:05:44,814 --> 00:05:50,859
Duke Thomas is a metahuman with powers. What
kind of powers? It involves light. I forget

62
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:56,424
the exact name of it, but he could essentially
see the past sort of almost like in a photographic

63
00:05:56,464 --> 00:06:01,108
way. Like if he looks into a room through the
light, he can see what had transpired there

64
00:06:01,188 --> 00:06:06,012
earlier. That's pretty cool. Yeah, it is really
cool. Great answer, Travis Herndon. Our next

65
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:12,185
honorable mention goes to Gavin Carrasco. Who
said? Hello, this is Gavin, first time responder.

66
00:06:14,127 --> 00:06:19,531
I am coming with the hot take of Kara Kelly
from The Dark Knight Returns. I always thought

67
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:24,656
she was the best of Dick Grayson with his wit
and charm, and I always thought she was smart

68
00:06:24,676 --> 00:06:30,321
like Tim Drake. And those are two of the best
Robins, so them combined made a really good

69
00:06:30,902 --> 00:06:35,650
Robin for an amazing Batman. So that's my answer,
Kara Kelly from The Dark Knight Returns. Yeah,

70
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,352
I still remember the first time I read The Dark
Knight Returns and how cool the character of

71
00:06:40,392 --> 00:06:45,115
Carrie Kelly was as a Robin. She, of course,
was the very first female Robin, you know,

72
00:06:45,195 --> 00:06:50,798
outside of DC's standard continuity. And she
did a fantastic job. Fan favorite, totally.

73
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:56,581
A favorite of mine for sure. So great answer,
Gavin. Was she Robin chronologically before

74
00:06:56,621 --> 00:07:00,523
Stephanie Brown was? Because I know Spoiler
has been a Robin as well. Well, Spoiler wasn't

75
00:07:00,543 --> 00:07:07,719
a Robin until I think the 2000s. Oh. So... Chronologically,
it's hard to say because the Dark Knight returns

76
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,642
takes place in the future. But from a publishing
standpoint Yeah, Carrie Kelly was the first

77
00:07:12,722 --> 00:07:18,005
Robin. She wasn't Robin for long She moved on
to being cat girl by the sequel to that story

78
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:22,908
But yeah, she still made for a cool Robin great
answer Gavin We want to give a quick shout

79
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:28,551
out to Cyrus Moore Daniel Alonso Daniel you
give the best answer. Basically his answer

80
00:07:28,591 --> 00:07:34,418
was who cares? It's Robin and as a Marvel fan.
I just loved that Shout out to Mike Williams

81
00:07:34,558 --> 00:07:38,682
and Peter Trull for calling in with your answers.
Thanks for taking the time to do that. But

82
00:07:38,702 --> 00:07:43,906
the winner of this week's No Prize is... Miggy
Mattingian, who said... Hey what's up guys,

83
00:07:43,926 --> 00:07:48,750
this is Miggy and my favorite Robin is the OG,
the best Robin, Dick Grayson. He's the paragon

84
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:53,114
of everything DC represents. He overcame great
tragedy, the selflessly championed hope and

85
00:07:53,134 --> 00:07:58,358
compassion to a world without those in and out
of the costume, and grew into a respected figure

86
00:07:58,418 --> 00:08:03,026
in the universe. He led teams like the Titans
and the Outsiders to bring about justice. and

87
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:08,029
even led the entire superhero community through
several world-shattering events like Dark Crisis,

88
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:12,973
Beast World, and Absolute Power. And he's just
really damn cool. Thanks guys. Yeah, I know

89
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:19,057
of no bigger Nightwing Dick Grayson fan than
our executive producer, Miggie Mathingian.

90
00:08:19,578 --> 00:08:24,721
I agree Dick Grayson is the best Robin for all
of the reasons that Miggie just stated. He

91
00:08:24,761 --> 00:08:29,185
is one of the most interesting and probably
one of the most important characters in the

92
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:34,527
entirety of DC Comics. someone who represents
the hope and compassion of Superman, but with

93
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:40,608
all of the ability and expertise of Batman,
he's just a fantastic character. Yeah, if you're

94
00:08:40,748 --> 00:08:45,649
a member of our Discord channel, you know how
much Mickey loves Dick. He loves Dick a lot.

95
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:51,211
Maybe too much, some might say, because the
character is just so-so. I only see him as

96
00:08:51,271 --> 00:08:55,312
the character who lost to Daredevil in the duel
that we had between those two characters. Oh

97
00:08:55,352 --> 00:08:57,993
wow, look, a Marvel fan with a low-hanging fruit.

98
00:09:01,678 --> 00:09:05,724
Great answer, Miggy! Proud of you, Miggy! You
win this week's No Prize. If you, the listener,

99
00:09:05,744 --> 00:09:09,830
wanna try winning your own No Prize, stay tuned
till later on in this episode when we'll be

100
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,397
asking another Question of the Week. But with
that out of the way, on to the news!

101
00:09:19,918 --> 00:09:26,262
Okay, so a few weeks ago we learned that Kyle
Chandler was cast as Hal Jordan in the upcoming

102
00:09:26,402 --> 00:09:32,546
Lantern series for HBO that's going to be a
part of James Gunn's new DC Cinematic Universe.

103
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:37,289
Now, the series supposedly has two leads, Hal
Jordan and Jon Stewart, and we've been waiting

104
00:09:37,329 --> 00:09:42,433
to see who is going to be cast as Jon Stewart,
this iconic Green Lantern character, and it

105
00:09:42,453 --> 00:09:48,637
looks like James Gunn has gone with Aaron Pierre
from the Netflix movie Rebel Ridge. Which I

106
00:09:48,657 --> 00:09:54,323
have not seen. But I hear is good. It's really
hard to be excited about this casting because

107
00:09:54,443 --> 00:09:58,464
I have not seen that yet. I haven't seen it
either, but apparently it's pretty popular

108
00:09:58,544 --> 00:10:03,365
on Netflix. Yeah, and a lot of people are praising
his performance in it. I know he has a ton

109
00:10:03,405 --> 00:10:08,707
of upcoming work, including The Lion King. He's
doing voice work for Mufasa. He's also playing

110
00:10:08,827 --> 00:10:14,708
Malcolm X in the Nat Geo series, MLK slash X.
The guy is definitely gonna be a star, especially

111
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:19,894
with this series. I think the craziest thing
about him is that, I think he is green eyes

112
00:10:19,914 --> 00:10:23,956
or blue eyes or something like that. They're
very piercing in a way that the comic book

113
00:10:23,976 --> 00:10:29,520
character John Stewart also has. Yeah, yeah,
John Stewart has green eyes in the comics when

114
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,342
he has his green lantern ring on, but it's like
they don't have any easy to do CGI for Aaron

115
00:10:34,382 --> 00:10:38,965
Pierce eyes because yeah, those things are really
bright, really striking. I wonder if that's

116
00:10:39,005 --> 00:10:42,627
one of the reasons he was chosen. Well that,
I mean, you know, he has a strong military

117
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:47,730
look to him. I believe him as, you know, this
ex-military guy. If you guys want to learn

118
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,113
more about the comic book character of Jon Stewart,
check out his duel episode we did against Quasar.

119
00:10:52,593 --> 00:10:57,136
Yeah, that was a fun episode. Jon Stewart is
my favorite Green Lantern, so I'm pretty excited

120
00:10:57,176 --> 00:11:01,458
for this casting, given though I'm not too familiar
with the actor. I'm more excited for this casting,

121
00:11:01,758 --> 00:11:06,241
actually, than I was of hearing that Kyle Chandler
was playing Kal Jordan. I wonder how the two

122
00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:11,204
will do chemistry wise. I know that all the
actors in Final Contention for the role of

123
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:15,726
Jon Stewart had to do a chemistry reading with
Kyle Chandler. Oh, I didn't know that. Yeah.

124
00:11:15,746 --> 00:11:19,527
That's great to hear. Well, if they chose Aaron
Pierre, then you know, I'm sure the chemistry

125
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:24,790
was fantastic. I'm actually really curious to
see what the dynamic will be between the two.

126
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:29,672
I'm assuming Kyle Chandler's Hal Jordan will
be training Aaron Pierre's Jon Stewart, but

127
00:11:29,692 --> 00:11:35,474
we'll see if that's the case. The Lantern Show
has a phenomenal crew behind the scenes, including

128
00:11:35,534 --> 00:11:40,956
writers Chris Mundy and Damon Lindelof. I expect
really good things from this show. And speaking

129
00:11:41,056 --> 00:11:44,137
of great superhero shows, that brings us to
our question of the week.

130
00:11:48,738 --> 00:11:55,501
What has been your favorite live action Marvel
or DC television series so far, and why? There

131
00:11:55,521 --> 00:12:00,864
have been quite a few to come out now, and pretty
much across the whole spectrum of really good

132
00:12:00,924 --> 00:12:06,527
to not so good. So I'm curious to hear what
your favorite is. Record your answer at dynamicduel.com

139
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:43,872
event, where we pit and a duel the two witch
characters of Clarion the Witch Boy and Agatha

140
00:12:43,913 --> 00:12:44,413
Harkness.

141
00:12:59,626 --> 00:13:05,948
Okay, Clarion the Witch Boy versus Agatha Harkness.
Of course, we wanted to do a Titan duel to

142
00:13:06,048 --> 00:13:11,069
Agatha Harkness because we knew that she was
going to be having her television series, Agatha

143
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:16,811
All Along, currently airing on Disney Plus during
the Halloween season. So it seemed very appropriate

144
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:23,353
to do a witch duel. Now us and the executive
producers had a hard time finding a match for

145
00:13:23,473 --> 00:13:29,336
Agatha. Initially, We had voted that we wanted
to put her up against Madame Xanadu, but in

146
00:13:29,396 --> 00:13:34,819
the end we determined that we could play up
on Agatha Harkness's old age, as she has been

147
00:13:34,859 --> 00:13:40,262
typically depicted in the comics for the majority
of her appearances in the comic books, against

148
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:45,725
the age of Clarion the Witch Boy, who's a young
child. Both of them have cats, both of them

149
00:13:45,745 --> 00:13:51,729
are witches, both of them are pretty powerful,
so it seemed like a pretty good matchup. Yeah,

150
00:13:51,829 --> 00:13:59,056
it's young versus old. Cat versus cat, Agatha
the witch versus Clarion the bitch. Whoa! Yeah,

151
00:13:59,076 --> 00:14:04,238
she's gonna make him her bitch in this episode.
I don't know if you knew that. I had to. Man,

152
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:09,921
with the low hanging fruit, you're right. Be
better. But to explain the methodology behind

153
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:16,103
our duels, let's go to our sentient duel simulator,
Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K, tell our listeners

154
00:14:16,123 --> 00:14:21,714
how you go about determining a winner in our
duel matchups. Yes, of course, sir. The way

155
00:14:21,774 --> 00:14:26,197
I determine a winner between the contestants
is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations

156
00:14:26,297 --> 00:14:31,180
using the characters statistics. A Monte Carlo
simulation is a probabilistic model used to

157
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,344
determine outcomes through random sampling.
In this case, I randomise the statistics along

158
00:14:36,364 --> 00:14:40,827
a normal distribution as a way to simulate the
many variables that can occur during battle.

159
00:14:41,227 --> 00:14:45,990
The stat parameters are based on the official
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters

160
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:47,391
statistics are extrapolated.

161
00:14:50,838 --> 00:14:55,967
damage potential, versatility and perception
in order to create a more detailed and accurate

162
00:14:56,007 --> 00:15:01,357
simulation. The results of the 1000 simulations
provide a percentage of wins for each character.

163
00:15:01,998 --> 00:15:06,401
Contestant with the higher percentage is declared
the victor as they have a higher probability

164
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:12,265
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,
neither character should win 100% of the matches.

165
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:17,268
The comic book stories have shown that there's
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman, so

166
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:21,171
the confidence rate of my method falls in line
with the precedents that have been established

167
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:26,774
in the source material. My mathematical simulations
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are

168
00:15:26,794 --> 00:15:31,157
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes
tabulated for determination of the winner.

169
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:37,081
Thanks AJ9K! Before we run the simulations though,
we'd like to break down each character's histories

170
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:42,286
and abilities before improvising a scenario
on how we imagine one of the 1,000 simulations

171
00:15:42,306 --> 00:15:46,949
would play out beat for beat. And I believe
it's my turn to go first this episode with

172
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:52,034
the Marvel characters backstory, so let me go
ahead and tell you guys all about Agatha Harkness.

173
00:15:52,614 --> 00:15:58,199
Agatha Harkness's early life is largely unknown,
but she has claimed to be centuries old, living

174
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:04,303
before the fall of Atlantis over 20,000 years
ago. As a child of the ancient world, she began

175
00:16:04,323 --> 00:16:09,545
her practice in witchcraft early on and eventually
became one of the Earth's most powerful sorceresses.

176
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:15,747
Her earliest documented activities took place
during the 1600s in an Eastern European country

177
00:16:15,787 --> 00:16:20,950
called Transia, near Wondagore Mountain, where
she was part of a coven of witches that faced

178
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:26,372
persecution during the height of the witch hunts
across Europe at the time. By the late 17th

179
00:16:26,412 --> 00:16:32,250
century, Agatha had relocated to Salem, Massachusetts.
where she established her own coven during

180
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:38,012
the infamous Salem witch trials. Rather than
hide from persecution this time, Agatha embraced

181
00:16:38,072 --> 00:16:42,113
it, believing that the trials were a way to
strengthen the magical community by weeding

182
00:16:42,193 --> 00:16:47,094
out those who were not strong enough to survive.
She sent some of her own followers to be judged

183
00:16:47,174 --> 00:16:51,915
and executed, believing that their sacrifice
would make the remaining witches more resilient.

184
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:58,077
During this time, Agatha encountered the time
displaced pyrokinetic mutant Firestar, whom

185
00:16:59,722 --> 00:17:05,186
and tried without success to burn at the stake.
Agatha admired Firestar's resilience in the

186
00:17:05,226 --> 00:17:10,710
face of adversity and her refusal to embrace
violence as a solution. This influenced Agatha

187
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:16,494
to abandon the idea of open warfare between
witches and non-magical humans and she led

188
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:22,038
the surviving witches westward, establishing
a hidden witch community called New Salem in

189
00:17:22,058 --> 00:17:26,961
the mountains of what would later become Colorado.
Here the witches were able to live in peace.

190
00:17:27,502 --> 00:17:32,743
far away from the fear and persecution from
mankind. In New Salem, Agatha gave birth to

191
00:17:32,783 --> 00:17:38,525
her son, Nicholas Scratch, who would later become
one of her most dangerous enemies. Over time,

192
00:17:38,705 --> 00:17:44,326
into the modern era, Agatha's ideals shifted,
and she began to see the dangers of the covens

193
00:17:44,426 --> 00:17:49,668
isolation. Believing that New Salem's retreat
from the world would eventually lead to stagnation

194
00:17:49,748 --> 00:17:54,709
and decline, she left the community to rejoin
the wider world. Her departure left a void

195
00:17:54,729 --> 00:17:59,292
in New Salem's leadership. and Nicholas Scratch
took advantage of this, rising to power and

196
00:17:59,332 --> 00:18:04,416
fostering a deep resentment toward his mother
for abandoning the community. After leaving

197
00:18:04,456 --> 00:18:09,880
New Salem, Agatha settled in New York, where
she became the governess for Franklin Richards,

198
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:15,604
the young son of Reed and Sue Storm of the Fantastic
Four. Though the Richards family initially

199
00:18:15,644 --> 00:18:20,988
had no idea of Agatha's true nature, her powers
were soon revealed when the Frightful Four

200
00:18:21,048 --> 00:18:26,284
villain team attempted to kidnap Franklin. Agatha
used her magic to easily defeat the villains,

201
00:18:26,604 --> 00:18:32,048
including transforming her cat Ebony into a
powerful panther to drive the intruders away.

202
00:18:32,528 --> 00:18:36,891
Her time with Franklin allowed her to bond with
the Richards family, though her relationship

203
00:18:36,911 --> 00:18:42,475
with them would soon be tested by the return
of her estranged son, Nicholas Scratch. Scratch,

204
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:47,959
now the leader of New Salem, convinced the witches
of that coven to abduct Agatha and Franklin,

205
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:52,902
bringing them back to stand trial for their
supposed crimes. The Fantastic Four pursued

206
00:18:53,022 --> 00:18:57,064
Agatha and Franklin to New Salem, where they
clashed with Nicholas Scratch's seven children,

207
00:18:57,445 --> 00:19:02,828
known as Salem Seven, who had inherited immense
magical powers from their father. Agatha and

208
00:19:02,848 --> 00:19:07,550
the Fantastic Four ultimately defeated Salem
Seven, revealing the truth of Nicholas Scratch's

209
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:13,013
evil machinations, and the people of New Salem
banished Scratch to another dimension. Following

210
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:18,396
her time with the Fantastic Four, Agatha shifted
her focus to another powerful individuel, Wanda

211
00:19:18,436 --> 00:19:24,399
Maximoff the Scarlet Witch. whose mutant abilities
were intertwined with dark magical forces,

212
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:30,202
desperately sought control over her powers,
which had become increasingly unstable. Agatha

213
00:19:30,242 --> 00:19:34,944
saw the danger the Scarlet Witch posed, both
to herself and to the world, and agreed to

214
00:19:34,984 --> 00:19:40,626
become her magical mentor. You can learn more
in our Zatanna vs Scarlet Witch duel episode.

215
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:44,988
Under Agatha's guidance, the Scarlet Witch learned
to tap into her abilities more effectively.

216
00:19:45,388 --> 00:19:50,095
Though Agatha kept the full truth of her powers,
particularly their connection to the dark god

217
00:19:50,115 --> 00:19:55,618
of chaos, C'thun, hidden from her. Agatha's
mentorship helped Scarlet Witch grow as a magic

218
00:19:55,738 --> 00:20:00,380
user, and her newfound control over her powers
left her confident to marry her romantic partner,

219
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,683
Vision, an android, which led to the subsequent
birth of their twin children. You can learn

220
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:10,746
more about Vision in his duel against Marsha
Manhunter. Wanda's children were later revealed

221
00:20:10,786 --> 00:20:18,814
to be magical constructs created from the fragments
of the demon Mephisto's soul. Agatha made the

222
00:20:18,854 --> 00:20:23,697
difficult decision to erase Wanda's memories
of her kids, believing it to be the only way

223
00:20:23,717 --> 00:20:28,941
to spare her from the overwhelming grief. This
act, though well-intentioned, planted the seeds

224
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:33,704
for Wanda's eventual mental breakdown. Agatha
continued to aid Wanda through her personal

225
00:20:33,744 --> 00:20:37,767
struggles, helping her face threats such as
Immortus, who sought to manipulate Wanda's

226
00:20:37,807 --> 00:20:42,731
reality-warping abilities for his own purposes.
With Agatha's help, the Avengers were able

227
00:20:42,771 --> 00:20:47,806
to defeat Immortus, though Wanda's fragile mental
state remained a constant concern. Years of

228
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:53,208
repressed trauma eventually led to Wanda's breakdown,
in part triggered by psychological manipulations

229
00:20:53,268 --> 00:20:58,851
by the villain Dr. Doom. In her grief and rage,
Scarlet Witch destroyed the Avengers Mansion,

230
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:03,853
which led to the dissolution of the Avengers
team. Wanda confronted Agatha, demanding to

231
00:21:03,893 --> 00:21:08,975
know the truth about her children. Not long
after, Agatha was found dead in her home, her

232
00:21:09,015 --> 00:21:13,857
body seemingly desiccated. You can learn more
about this in our Justice League vs Avengers

233
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:19,749
Team Duel episode. However, even death did not
end Agatha's influence. She continued to appear

234
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:24,974
in spectral form, forgiving Scarlet Witch and
guiding her and others through the challenges

235
00:21:25,014 --> 00:21:30,378
they faced. Eventually, Agatha was brought back
to life via the Goddess of Witchcraft, who

236
00:21:30,418 --> 00:21:34,902
was cleansed by Scarlet Witch during her journey
through a mystical dimension known as the Witch's

237
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:40,186
Road. Upon Agatha's resurrection, she returned
to the magical fold, this time teaching new

238
00:21:40,226 --> 00:21:46,262
witches at Dr. Strange's new Magic Academy.
It was there- that an old coven member called

239
00:21:46,322 --> 00:21:51,223
Corrosion attempted to kill Agatha, but she
was rescued by her new students, including

240
00:21:51,383 --> 00:21:56,845
the former Runaways member, Niko Minoru, a teen
sorceress. The mystical energies unleashed

241
00:21:56,885 --> 00:22:02,607
from the battle resulted in Agatha being de-aged
from her elderly appearance into a young woman.

242
00:22:03,087 --> 00:22:08,148
After the Scarlet Witch destroyed a powerful
book of chaos magic called the Darkhold, Agatha

243
00:22:08,188 --> 00:22:13,106
attempted to create a new Darkhold. Her plans
were eventually thwarted by the Avengers. the

244
00:22:13,146 --> 00:22:18,388
consequences of which led to the Darkhold taking
on the form of a young boy, whom Agatha fled

245
00:22:18,408 --> 00:22:24,210
with in an attempt to guide him. And that's
Agatha's backstory. Powers-wise, Agatha Harkness

246
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,552
is one of the most formidable witches on the
planet, allowing her to cast all manner of

247
00:22:28,612 --> 00:22:35,495
spells. Her witchcraft abilities include precognition,
possession, elemental manipulation, and transmutation.

248
00:22:35,956 --> 00:22:41,938
She can fly, teleport, cast illusions, and sense
mystic occurrences. Agatha has the ability

249
00:22:41,978 --> 00:22:47,059
to summon mystical energies for offensive or
defensive purposes, or manipulate these mystical

250
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:52,621
energies to enhance, reflect, or negate their
magical effects. With enough time, she can

251
00:22:52,661 --> 00:22:58,023
perform a magic ritual to achieve any number
of spells. Her familiar, Ebony, is a magical

252
00:22:58,063 --> 00:23:03,464
cat capable of transforming into a powerful
panther and regenerating from almost any wound.

253
00:23:04,325 --> 00:23:08,470
Agatha has extensive knowledge of witchcraft
gained over millennia. and has trained other

254
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:14,434
powerful individuels in the use of their abilities.
She's also terribly mysterious, I'll say, even

255
00:23:14,534 --> 00:23:19,897
inexplicably surviving death on several occasions.
There you go. This old hag doesn't stand a

256
00:23:20,017 --> 00:23:25,220
chance. Wow. Way to discriminate on the basis
of age there. Good job. I don't feel bad if

257
00:23:25,261 --> 00:23:30,604
it's a fictional character, I'm just putting
that out there. Also she was de-aged, so like

258
00:23:30,624 --> 00:23:34,410
I don't know what you're talking about. Largely
they did that just- so that the character would

259
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:38,894
be consistent with how she appears in the Marvel
Cinematic Universe, played by Katherine Han.

260
00:23:39,275 --> 00:23:44,299
Yeah, and I figured that. Yeah. Brand synergy.
As I've typically known the character in the

261
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:47,962
comics though, yeah, she's pretty old. That's
kind of what made her such a badass though,

262
00:23:47,982 --> 00:23:52,286
because she's like so seemingly frail, almost
looking kind of like Aunt May in the comics,

263
00:23:52,747 --> 00:23:58,472
but she's supremely powerful. Well, not as powerful
as Clarion! Let me get into his backstory.

264
00:23:59,092 --> 00:24:06,563
Now, Clarion Bleak. often referred to as Clarion
the Witch Boy, was born in Limbotown, an isolated

265
00:24:06,643 --> 00:24:14,365
and mysterious subterranean society hidden beneath
New York City. Limbotown was populated by Kroatoans,

266
00:24:14,646 --> 00:24:20,247
who were the descendants of the Lost Roanoke
Colony, America's first permanent English settlement

267
00:24:20,547 --> 00:24:26,209
that later mysteriously vanished. To survive
in the New World, the Kroatoans had developed

268
00:24:26,289 --> 00:24:32,769
a deep connection to dark magic. and necromancy
over centuries. Every citizen in Limbo Town

269
00:24:32,789 --> 00:24:38,875
practiced witchcraft and had a draga, or an
animal familiar, that aided them in their magical

270
00:24:38,915 --> 00:24:45,061
pursuits. Clarion's familiar was a cat named
Tikal, who shared her master's rebellious and

271
00:24:45,081 --> 00:24:50,586
mischievous nature. From a young age, Clarion
struggled with the strict rules and religious

272
00:24:50,626 --> 00:24:57,255
codes enforced by Submissionary Judah, Limbo
Town's leader. Judah and the other elders dictated

273
00:24:57,295 --> 00:25:02,479
how magic could be used, and they harshly discouraged
any curiosity or questioning about the world

274
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:08,264
beyond Limbo Town's borders. Clarion, however,
was always drawn to the unknown and wanted

275
00:25:08,304 --> 00:25:13,609
to explore beyond his subterranean world. He
secretly began studying darker and forbidden

276
00:25:13,649 --> 00:25:19,774
forms of magic, driven by his thirst for knowledge
and freedom. His disobedience did not go unnoticed,

277
00:25:19,814 --> 00:25:20,194
however.

278
00:25:24,286 --> 00:25:28,997
eventually caught the attention of the town
elders. And one day, Clarion found himself

279
00:25:29,057 --> 00:25:35,143
pursued by the Horagil. terrifying entities
created when Judah and other submissionaries

280
00:25:35,543 --> 00:25:41,766
merged with their familiars. Clarion fled Limbo
Town with Teekal by his side, narrowly escaping

281
00:25:41,806 --> 00:25:47,129
the clutches of the Horagold, and emerged in
the subway tunnels beneath New York City, marking

282
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:53,292
his first encounter with the world above, which
he'd later refer to as the Blue Rafters. In

283
00:25:53,332 --> 00:25:58,954
the subway tunnels, Clarion met Ebenezer Bade,
another runaway from Limbo Town who had escaped

284
00:26:01,296 --> 00:26:06,579
Clarion under his wing, showing him the many
wonders and dangers of the surface world. It

285
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:12,623
was long, however, before Bade betrayed Clarion,
with the intention to sell the boy into slavery.

286
00:26:13,103 --> 00:26:19,227
In response, Clarion and Teekal confronted Bade
alongside a group of hive-minded children known

287
00:26:19,368 --> 00:26:25,752
as the Leviathan, whom Bade had been capturing
for years, also to sell into slavery. With

288
00:26:25,772 --> 00:26:31,356
the Leviathan's help, Clarion put an end to
Bade's schemes, and Bade was ultimately the

289
00:26:31,396 --> 00:26:36,959
children he had exploited. Although the Leviathan
offered Clarion a place among them, the Witch

290
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:42,863
Boy declined as he wanted to continue his explorations
of the world beyond. Clarion's travels led

291
00:26:42,883 --> 00:26:47,386
him to Manhattan, where he crossed paths with
a man named Melmoth, who you can learn more

292
00:26:47,426 --> 00:26:52,910
about in our Frankenstein vs Elsa Bloodstone
duel episode. Melmoth offered Clarion food

293
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:57,313
and shelter, while Clarion remained unaware
that Melmoth was the Sheeta King,

294
00:27:01,356 --> 00:27:07,480
ago by breeding the women of the Rhonok colony
with the Sheeta, a devolved human insectoid

295
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:13,063
race from the future. Mellmoth intended to use
Clarion and a group of young delinquents known

296
00:27:13,104 --> 00:27:19,148
as the Deviant Ones to steal a massive subterranean
drill to invade and plunder Limbo Town, taking

297
00:27:19,208 --> 00:27:25,152
back what he believed was his by right. When
Clarion realized the extent of Mellmoth's plans,

298
00:27:25,532 --> 00:27:27,413
he warned the Deviants about the Sheeta

299
00:27:31,496 --> 00:27:36,159
Instead, Clarion decided to return to Limbo
Town to protect his people from the impending

300
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:41,482
invasion. Upon his return to Limbo Town, however,
Clarion faced immediate hostility from the

301
00:27:41,522 --> 00:27:46,426
town's people, who accused him of blasphemy,
and believing he had abandoned their way of

302
00:27:46,466 --> 00:27:51,729
life, bringing back dangerous ideas back with
him from the outside world. Clarion tried to

303
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:56,733
warn them about Melmoth's invasion, but the
town's people refused to listen and instead

304
00:27:56,793 --> 00:28:02,176
captured Clarion to burn him at the stake for
his supposed crimes. Before they could carry

305
00:28:02,236 --> 00:28:07,220
out the execution, however, Melmoth and his
army arrived, interrupting the proceedings.

306
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:12,803
Clarion seized the opportunity to escape, and
as he ran to ring the town bell in alarm, he

307
00:28:12,843 --> 00:28:18,627
ran into Judah, who was gravely wounded. Recognizing
that his death was near, and that Limbo Town

308
00:28:18,647 --> 00:28:24,992
was in great danger, Judah passed on the title
of Submissionary to Clarion. With this title

309
00:28:25,292 --> 00:28:31,756
came the ability to transform into a horror
gold, the same monstrous being when he fled

310
00:28:31,956 --> 00:28:38,220
Limbo Town. Merging with Tikal, Clarion assumed
the form of a powerful Horacle and fought off

311
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:45,165
Melmoth's forces. He severely crippled the Sheet-o-king
in battle, forcing Melmoth to retreat and saving

312
00:28:45,285 --> 00:28:50,909
Limbo Town from destruction. Despite his victory,
Clarion rejected the idea of staying in Limbo

313
00:28:50,949 --> 00:28:57,113
Town as its leader, longing instead for freedom
and adventure, sans any responsibility, and

314
00:28:57,153 --> 00:29:03,057
therefore departed for the surface world once
again, as the She-Da attempted to overtake

315
00:29:03,077 --> 00:29:08,180
the planet. When the organization Shade and
their agent Frankenstein attacked the She-Da's

316
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,724
time-traveling fortress known as the Castle
Revolving, Clarion took advantage of the situation

317
00:29:14,024 --> 00:29:19,528
to take over the fortress and the She-Da, becoming
the new She-Da King and taking the She-Da into

318
00:29:19,568 --> 00:29:25,772
the past before he abandoned his crown. Upon
returning to the present, Clarion allied himself

319
00:29:25,812 --> 00:29:28,014
with Contessa Erika Alexandria del

320
00:29:31,016 --> 00:29:35,978
who led a secret global organization known as
the Agenda, which sought to cause chaos within

321
00:29:36,018 --> 00:29:42,161
the superhero community. Using his magical abilities,
Clarion cast a spell that swapped the ages

322
00:29:42,201 --> 00:29:47,584
of teenage and adult heroes, turning young heroes
into adults and their adult counterparts into

323
00:29:47,664 --> 00:29:54,287
teenagers. The spell created confusion and mistrust
amongst both heroes and the general public,

324
00:29:54,607 --> 00:29:59,169
which delighted Clarion. For him, the chaos
he caused was nothing more than a mischievous

325
00:29:59,269 --> 00:30:04,793
prank. another opportunity to push boundaries
and test his powers, as well as have powerful

326
00:30:04,953 --> 00:30:10,657
playmates to occupy his time. However, Clarion's
actions eventually backfired when he was confronted

327
00:30:10,697 --> 00:30:16,201
by a vengeful Lobo, who had been turned into
a child by Clarion's spell. Upon his defeat,

328
00:30:16,241 --> 00:30:22,145
Clarion was forced to undo the spell and restore
the heroes to their proper ages. Lonely, without

329
00:30:22,185 --> 00:30:27,289
his young playmates, Clarion traveled the country
occasionally offering heroes and villains alike

330
00:30:27,469 --> 00:30:33,472
increased power. in exchange for portions of
their souls. While in Gotham City, a fellow

331
00:30:33,512 --> 00:30:38,694
Limbotown exile kidnapped Teekal, along with
other Witch's familiars, in order to conjure

332
00:30:38,714 --> 00:30:44,137
an apocalyptic entity known as the Judgment
Beast. But with the help of Tim Drake, Robin,

333
00:30:44,557 --> 00:30:49,259
Clarion was able to rescue Teekal and return
the familiars back to their rightful owners.

334
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:54,181
You can learn more about Tim Drake and his duel
against the Winter Soldier. In post-Flashpoint

335
00:30:54,201 --> 00:30:59,464
continuity, Clarion encountered several mystical
figures in New York and Kim involved with a

336
00:30:59,504 --> 00:31:05,708
magical coven led by Piper, who sought to help
him understand and control his powers. During

337
00:31:05,748 --> 00:31:10,892
this time, Clarion faced a mysterious villain
named Cole, who had introduced a form of dangerous,

338
00:31:10,992 --> 00:31:17,016
addictive technology onto the streets. Clarion,
always seeking new ways to strengthen himself,

339
00:31:17,196 --> 00:31:23,040
ingested this future technology to boost his
powers and confront Cole. Their battle ended

340
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:30,225
with Clarion easily defeating his foe by stealing
his techno magic, further own abilities. Later,

341
00:31:30,565 --> 00:31:36,189
Clarion ascended to new heights as a powerful
Lord of Chaos, aligning himself with Pariah's

342
00:31:36,289 --> 00:31:42,573
Dark Army in order to re-establish DC's original
multiverse. And that's his backstory so far.

343
00:31:43,013 --> 00:31:49,177
Powers-wise, as a Kroatoan warlock, Clarion
is a natural prodigy of the Dark Arts and the

344
00:31:49,217 --> 00:31:55,101
Occult, with powers sourced from his bond with
his magical cat familiar, Tikal, with whom

345
00:31:55,141 --> 00:32:03,848
Clarion has a psychic link. telekinesis, transmutation,
teleportation, energy absorption and manipulation,

346
00:32:04,348 --> 00:32:10,754
telepathy, divination, and spellcasting. He's
also quite durable, as long as he's near Tikal.

347
00:32:11,154 --> 00:32:18,160
If Tikal is injured, Clarion's power is greatly
reduced. That's Clarion. So what's interesting

348
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:23,604
there is that for the most part Agatha Harkness
has been a supporting character among the larger

349
00:32:23,704 --> 00:32:29,505
Marvel She's had her own titles occasionally,
but they haven't lasted very long. But according

350
00:32:29,525 --> 00:32:33,909
to your backstory for Clarion, it seems like
he's a long running character with his own

351
00:32:33,949 --> 00:32:39,293
titles. I'm interested in like who created the
character and when did his stories really start

352
00:32:39,313 --> 00:32:44,437
taking place? Jack Kirby created the character.
He was originally a villain for Jason Blood,

353
00:32:44,557 --> 00:32:50,222
I believe. He appeared in the Demon comics,
who was also a creation of Jack Kirby's. Uh,

354
00:32:50,242 --> 00:32:54,725
he's only had a few of his own mini series though.
He had one that was written by Grant Morrison.

355
00:32:55,266 --> 00:33:00,248
He also had a recent one, but yeah, not too
many. Okay, so much of his backstory was kind

356
00:33:00,268 --> 00:33:04,831
of detailed in the Entrakin the Demon comic
books. Well, his own comics, I would say, like

357
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:09,954
Seven Soldiers of Victory written by Grant Morrison.
Oh, I see, okay. Grant Morrison kind of rewrote

358
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:15,437
Clarion's origin story. In Jack Kirby's original
version for the character, he was from Witch

359
00:33:15,477 --> 00:33:19,899
World, and I think that was later retconned
to Beyond Country. It was another dimension

360
00:33:19,939 --> 00:33:25,051
entirely. But Grant Morrison was the one who
kind of established him as being descendant

361
00:33:25,131 --> 00:33:30,482
of the Roanoke colony, which is a real colony
and a real mystery in the US. Kroatoa, yeah,

362
00:33:30,522 --> 00:33:34,129
that is a weird mystery. Definitely a spooky
one just in time for the season.

363

who will emerge victorious. Visit dynamicpodcast.com,
where we settle the debate and settle the score.

371
00:34:28,846 --> 00:34:31,788
Now that we got their histories and abilities
out of the way, we're going to speculate on

372
00:34:31,828 --> 00:34:37,152
how one of the 1000 simulated matches will go.
The winner is determined by simulations, not

373
00:34:37,172 --> 00:34:41,535
the speculation, but it's fun to imagine how
the fight could play out. AJ and IK, what are

374
00:34:41,555 --> 00:34:47,039
the rules of our speculation? Well, I should
say there are no rules, other than the characters

375
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:51,602
have no prior knowledge of the other going into
the fight. All they are aware of starting out

376
00:34:51,942 --> 00:34:56,205
is that the other character is a threat that
needs to be eliminated. For the speculation...

377
00:34:56,642 --> 00:35:01,704
contestants will begin approximately 50 meters
apart in a nondescript environment that will

378
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:07,047
have no bearing on the match itself as no environmental
statistics are considered in my simulations.

379
00:35:07,348 --> 00:35:12,590
The contestants must earn victory on their own
merit. Alright then let's get into it. Clarion

380
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:17,673
the Witch Boy and Agatha Harkness meet on the
battlefield. Who goes first? You know what

381
00:35:17,753 --> 00:35:24,477
I think Clarion will go first by aging Agatha
up to her old lady form if she isn't there

382
00:35:24,517 --> 00:35:29,712
already. then he's gonna let Agatha go, you
know, citing age before beauty. Alright, okay,

383
00:35:30,512 --> 00:35:37,516
um, that's fucked up. I think Agatha will probably
smirk at what just happened. You know, she's

384
00:35:37,616 --> 00:35:43,719
used to being an old lady anyway. Her cat Ebony
is gonna hiss at Clarion, and Agatha is gonna

385
00:35:43,739 --> 00:35:48,841
give the little brat what's coming to him. She's
gonna use her magic to erect a dead tree behind

386
00:35:48,901 --> 00:35:53,740
Clarion. and she's going to animate the tree
so that it bends Clarion over its trunk and

387
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,765
then gives the child a swift paddle on his behind.
Okay, actually once the tree touches Clarion,

388
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:06,509
it's going to burst into green flame and then
like quickly dissolve into ash, except for

389
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:12,253
like one small black branch that's shaped like
a slingshot that Clarion's going to pick up

390
00:36:12,293 --> 00:36:17,436
and use it to magically sling green fireballs
at Agatha while just laughing his head off.

391
00:36:17,616 --> 00:36:23,449
Well, before the fireballs can reach her, Agatha
is gonna telekinetically yank Clarion's slingshot

392
00:36:23,489 --> 00:36:28,293
toward her, transforming it into a broom. Okay,
and she's gonna use that broom to just swat

393
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:33,537
away the green fireballs with little to no effort,
and then she's gonna hop on the broom and fly

394
00:36:33,577 --> 00:36:40,823
into the night sky with her cat. And then from
the air, she's gonna start throwing down purple

395
00:36:41,263 --> 00:36:47,488
lightning magic bolts at Clarion. Ah, but Agatha
can't hit what she can't see. Because you know,

396
00:36:47,548 --> 00:36:52,746
as she was flying into the air... Clarion summoned
a plague of locusts that's going to fill the

397
00:36:52,766 --> 00:36:57,888
environment around them just with darkness,
blotting out the stars and the moon and knocking

398
00:36:58,028 --> 00:37:03,690
Agatha out of the sky. Okay, but Agatha is going
to dodge these locusts and she's going to fly

399
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:09,711
around and summon a massive whirlwind that's
going to dispel this locust plague by sucking

400
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:15,153
all the bugs out of the sky and away from the
battlefield. And now that the moon is visible

401
00:37:15,193 --> 00:37:20,462
again, Agatha is going to wave her hand over
it. which is gonna turn the moon blood red

402
00:37:20,722 --> 00:37:27,764
in color, okay? And as it shines its moonlight
onto Clarion, blood is just gonna start pouring

403
00:37:27,784 --> 00:37:33,286
from his eyes and his mouth and nose and his
ears, just like all the holes, and he's gonna

404
00:37:33,306 --> 00:37:38,847
fall down to his knees in pain. That's wild.
Okay, actually I'm gonna say Clarion falls

405
00:37:38,887 --> 00:37:45,549
to his knees because he's laughing so hard.
And while he's laughing, he's gonna use his

406
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:51,868
own blood to draw. these intricate runes on
the ground that stop the blood moon curse,

407
00:37:52,408 --> 00:37:58,612
and from the earth that his blood was spilled
on, he conjures this gargoyle that rises from

408
00:37:58,652 --> 00:38:04,875
the ground, and it's gonna fly after Agatha
and just slash her with its claws. Okay, but

409
00:38:04,976 --> 00:38:10,058
as the gargoyle approaches Agatha, as she's
in the air, her black cat Ebony is gonna leap

410
00:38:10,138 --> 00:38:16,638
off the broomstick and midair transform into
a demonic werecat creature. Like an evil panther

411
00:38:16,658 --> 00:38:22,942
on steroids, kinda. And with a loud roar, Ebony's
gonna tackle the gargoyle down to the ground

412
00:38:22,982 --> 00:38:28,126
and just shatter it into small pebbles and sand
and stuff like that. And then she's gonna take

413
00:38:28,146 --> 00:38:34,130
a shit on the gargoyle. Because it's like it
was kitty litter and Ebony turns back into

414
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:41,095
a cat. Dude, okay. Well, as Ebony was taking
the time to take a shit,

415
00:38:45,534 --> 00:38:51,177
orange tabby cat familiar, Teekel, on Ebony's
panther form. But Teekel is going to be in

416
00:38:51,217 --> 00:38:57,441
the form of this giant monstrous lion. And the
two cats are going to scream and clawed with

417
00:38:57,481 --> 00:39:01,504
just tufts of fur flying everywhere. Basically
it's the worst cat fight you could possibly

418
00:39:01,544 --> 00:39:08,288
imagine. And it's going to end though with Ebony's
neck snapped in Teekel's jaws because no way

419
00:39:08,328 --> 00:39:15,421
a panther is defeating a lion. No, no, no. Ebony,
the cat, has gone up against Mephisto himself

420
00:39:15,841 --> 00:39:20,764
and lived to tell the tale, okay? What? The
cat was straight up turned inside out by Mephisto

421
00:39:21,245 --> 00:39:25,808
and it still came back like nothing had happened
because Ebony has like the most insane magical

422
00:39:25,828 --> 00:39:32,212
healing factor ever. And also, I'm gonna say
that Agatha puts a binding hex on Teekal to

423
00:39:32,252 --> 00:39:37,335
prevent it from fighting back against Ebony.
So Ebony's just mopping the floor with Teekal

424
00:39:37,456 --> 00:39:44,341
and making Teekal look like a busted ass. hairless
lion by this point. And Clarion's magic is

425
00:39:44,421 --> 00:39:50,185
weakened because Tikal is weakened. And also
I gotta say, everyone knows any witch worth

426
00:39:50,205 --> 00:39:56,170
their salt has a black cat, not an orange one.
So yeah, all the basic bitch witches have black

427
00:39:56,210 --> 00:40:02,856
cats. But with Tikal trapped, you know, I'm
not going to lie, Clarion, he's pretty emotionally

428
00:40:02,876 --> 00:40:07,700
immature. So seeing his cat trapped in that
spell, it was probably going to cause him to

429
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:14,203
throw a screaming fit. and Clarion's cries are
gonna rattle both Agatha and Ebony, making

430
00:40:14,243 --> 00:40:20,064
them feel like their heads are gonna explode.
So while they're stunned, Clarion's gonna teleport

431
00:40:20,145 --> 00:40:27,347
over to Tikal and merge with him, transforming
into a massive horacle. What's a horacle? Again,

432
00:40:27,367 --> 00:40:33,808
what do they look like? They all look different,
but Clarion's version looks like a four-armed

433
00:40:34,229 --> 00:40:40,151
werecat with like a second face on his forehead.
It's essentially like Clarion's ultimate form.

434
00:40:40,731 --> 00:40:46,573
And as a horror goal, you know, before Agatha
and Ebony can even react, their entrails are

435
00:40:46,673 --> 00:40:51,915
already strewn all over the battlefield because
the horror goal ripped them both to shreds

436
00:40:52,456 --> 00:41:00,879
match over. Wow. Well, OK. Agatha and Ebony
are all shredded and dead, except that they're

437
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:06,998
not. In fact, Agatha is over off to the side
of the battlefield sipping tea. with Ebony

438
00:41:07,038 --> 00:41:12,200
in her lap. Because what Clarion thought he
saw, that was just an illusion that Agatha

439
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:19,863
had cast as a distraction. And suddenly, Clarion's
Horacle form just drops dead. Because what

440
00:41:19,943 --> 00:41:26,486
he didn't realize was that this match was already
over the moment that Ebony used that destroyed

441
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:33,849
Blood Gargoyle as a litter box. Okay, because
her poo cast a poisonous curse that seeped

442
00:41:33,869 --> 00:41:40,272
into Clarion's blood, right? and it just tainted
him with this like slow death. And since Clarion

443
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:45,735
merged with Teekal, they're both dead. That's
your finishing move? Yeah, dude, cat poop's

444
00:41:45,775 --> 00:41:50,238
dangerous, all right? Like it has parasites
in it and shit that can give you toxoplasmosis,

445
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:54,880
okay? It's dangerous enough on its own, like
it can give you schizophrenia and shit. So

446
00:41:54,920 --> 00:42:01,144
imagine how dangerous a demon panther's poop
is. Just makes sense. Is that true? Like, yeah.

447
00:42:01,624 --> 00:42:07,110
I record this podcast in my basement. Not too
far away from my cat's litter box. Well, I

448
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:13,352
mean, that explains why you're a DC fan, then.
It's the neurosis. OK. You know what? I'm calling

449
00:42:13,912 --> 00:42:20,914
cat shit on all of this. No way Clarion gets
taken out by cat poop. In reality, Agatha and

450
00:42:20,994 --> 00:42:26,356
Ebony are already dead. The whole, oh, it's
just an illusion thing. That didn't happen.

451
00:42:26,776 --> 00:42:32,417
Well, we could leave the match there. Either
Agatha and Ebony get shredded by Clarion's

452
00:42:32,457 --> 00:42:39,188
Horacle form. Or that's just an illusion and
Clarion dies from being poisoned with a curse.

453
00:42:39,748 --> 00:42:44,110
A poop curse. The worst kind. We'll go ahead
and leave it there and put the character's

454
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:50,212
stats into our simulator, run the simulations,
and come back with a winner. AJ9K, hit it!

455
00:42:50,713 --> 00:42:57,955
Inputting data. Running calculations. Processing
results. Simulations complete. Alright, Clarion

456
00:42:57,995 --> 00:43:04,810
the Witch Boy vs Agatha Harkness. As I suspected,
the characters were f- fairly close stat wise

457
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:10,112
and when one character did come out on top it
wasn't by much. Yeah, the characters are both

458
00:43:10,132 --> 00:43:15,793
a little bit vague in their magical abilities
as witches and wizards tend to be. You know,

459
00:43:16,254 --> 00:43:21,275
they can almost do anything in a sense, but
these two characters were unique in that they

460
00:43:21,315 --> 00:43:26,517
had some similarities around things like fighting
skill that kind of set them apart. You know,

461
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:31,491
they're both not physical fighters at all. Yeah,
and when it came to things like movement speed,

462
00:43:31,652 --> 00:43:38,177
strength, damage level, range, perception, versatility,
they were evenly matched. Yeah, we said Agatha

463
00:43:38,257 --> 00:43:43,681
did come out a little bit ahead when it came
to intellect just because Agatha's lived for

464
00:43:43,761 --> 00:43:50,346
millennia and she's not as naive as Clarion
is. Yeah, Clarion is a literal child, a smart

465
00:43:50,386 --> 00:43:56,875
child, but a child. Yeah, he's not wise like
Agatha is. Clarion, however, came out far ahead

466
00:43:56,895 --> 00:44:01,757
when it came to durability, because the dude
has been slapped by heavy hitters like Edric

467
00:44:01,777 --> 00:44:07,000
and the Demon and Lobo. Yeah, and Mary Marvel,
all kinds of heavy hitters. We also said that

468
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:13,083
Agatha got the edge when it came to evasiveness,
simply because there's a lot more instances

469
00:44:13,164 --> 00:44:18,907
of her avoiding damage than Clarion. Yeah, through
her magic shields and illusion casting and

470
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:23,629
things like that. She has to avoid damage because
she's just not as durable. She will literally

471
00:44:23,669 --> 00:44:28,467
break a hip. Exactly. So with all that in mind,
Jonathan, who do you think is coming out on

472
00:44:28,507 --> 00:44:34,568
top in this match? I think Clarion. Just because
there's no young boy that's going to be taken

473
00:44:34,648 --> 00:44:41,150
out by an old woman, it's just not a thing that
happens. And so far, our followers on Instagram

474
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:46,892
agree with me. I put up the poll a little late,
but so far, 55% of the poll takers agree with

475
00:44:46,952 --> 00:44:51,033
me. Well, that just makes me think that we have
a lot of younger poll takers that just don't

476
00:44:51,053 --> 00:44:55,375
know any better. Actually that makes me feel
like a lot of those who voted are children

477
00:44:55,415 --> 00:44:59,477
of the 90s considering that Clarion featured
in a prominent episode of Batman the animated

478
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:05,639
series back in the day. That's true but Agatha
Harkness has her own fucking series. How crazy

479
00:45:05,679 --> 00:45:10,441
is that? Well people must not like it because
of not voting for her. Whatever. Let's go ahead

480
00:45:10,461 --> 00:45:19,905
and see who won. AG9K the results please. Hey
Yuasa. Okay. The winner between Clarion the

481
00:45:19,965 --> 00:45:31,628
witch boy and Agatha Harkness is... AGATHA HARKNESS!
NOOOOOO! That's right! She made Clarion the

482
00:45:31,648 --> 00:45:38,030
Witch Boy her little bitch boy by beating him
in 515 matches out of the 1000 total battles.

483
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:47,833
Clarion only won 485. So Agatha's win percentage
is 51.5% and Clarion's is 48.5%. That is really

484
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:53,876
close. Like... I don't think Agatha made Clarion
her bitch. She did though, because she won.

485
00:45:54,156 --> 00:45:59,259
So Clarion can cry about it. He probably will,
honestly, not going to lie. But now you have

486
00:45:59,279 --> 00:46:05,842
to deal with that. So congratulations. I will
deal with it by not dealing with it and more

487
00:46:05,862 --> 00:46:10,885
than likely laughing at the kid. Because that's
what happens when you mess with Marvel and

488
00:46:10,965 --> 00:46:15,668
old ladies and think that you could beat them.
Old ladies can sometimes be pretty badass,

489
00:46:15,968 --> 00:46:21,139
as Agatha Harkness has shown here today. I was
going to say that young Puritan boys could

490
00:46:21,179 --> 00:46:27,984
also be badass, but I don't think that's true.
Well, I guess that does it for this duel. AJ9K,
