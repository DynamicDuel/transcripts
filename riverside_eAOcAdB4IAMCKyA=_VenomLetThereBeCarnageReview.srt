1
00:00:03,277 --> 00:00:03,338
you

2
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,651
Welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:27,671 --> 00:00:32,914
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:33,414 --> 00:00:38,796
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous
Joe. And in this episode, we will be reviewing

5
00:00:39,016 --> 00:00:46,339
the newly released film in theaters, Venom,
Let There Be Carnage. And uh, you know, it

6
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:53,026
was, it was dumb. It was not great. It was definitely
at least not better than the first movie. but

7
00:00:53,066 --> 00:00:56,867
we'll give you our full thoughts about the film
later on this episode. Before that, we're going

8
00:00:56,887 --> 00:01:00,349
to break down the comic book movie news to have
come out in the past week. Yeah, there's no

9
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:05,171
DC news this time. I think they're saving all
of that for the upcoming DC fandom later this

10
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:09,613
month. So we're going to have to settle for
Marvel scraps, including Disney settling Scarlett

11
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:15,235
Johansson's lawsuits over Black Widow and The
Eternals gets an updated synopsis. As always,

newest patron, Levi Yeaton, who is also our

24
00:02:18,352 --> 00:02:24,191
newest executive producer of the show. So Levi,
be sure to flaunt that shit. You officially

25
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:28,493
helped Jonathan and I in our monthly executive
producer meetings, determine the content for

26
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:32,415
this show, including duels and reviews. Although
we haven't determined too many reviews lately

27
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:36,797
because there's so much new stuff coming down
the pike. No, but welcome aboard, Levi. It's

28
00:02:36,817 --> 00:02:43,240
going to be a lot of fun. But with that out
of the way, quick to the no prize. A no prize

29
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,590
is an award Marvel used to give out up until
the 90s to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel

30
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:52,693
No Prize, is a digital award we post on social
media that Jonathan personally draws for those

31
00:02:52,713 --> 00:02:57,916
who we feel gave the best answer to our question
of the week. Last week's question was a doozy.

32
00:02:58,376 --> 00:03:03,419
We asked you guys off the back of the Injustice
trailer, should Batman have killed the Joker

33
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,142
in the comics? Why or why not? And we got a
whole ton of great answers here. A lot of people

34
00:03:09,202 --> 00:03:13,624
on both sides of the coin. It was really hard
to pick just three honorable mentions and the

35
00:03:13,664 --> 00:03:17,398
winner. So we want to thank everyone who answered.
but let's go ahead and run down our honorable

36
00:03:17,438 --> 00:03:23,380
mentions. Our first honorable mention goes to
DC Joe, who said, Batman should have definitely

37
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,882
killed the Joker after maybe the first or second
one, like when he thinks he'll be reformed,

38
00:03:29,382 --> 00:03:32,783
that's understandable, but after that, it's
just a pattern that he's not willing to see.

39
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:39,265
And honestly, that makes him an accomplice.
Yeah, kill him. Either that or, I don't know,

40
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:44,211
extradite him to a state that has a death penalty.
That's what I'm saying. You know, how often

41
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:50,195
has the Joker shown to be incapable of rehabilitation?
You know, every time the Joker escapes from

42
00:03:50,255 --> 00:03:54,258
Arkham Asylum, because he's always going to
fucking do that shit, Batman has blood on his

43
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:59,822
hands for always taking him back to that minimum
security nuthouse and letting Joker escape

44
00:03:59,962 --> 00:04:05,826
and kill more people. It's on Batman. He's an
accomplice to this mass murderer. To say Batman

45
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:11,630
is an accomplice is very, very unfair, I feel
like. He's trying to stop the Joker. And to

46
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:16,891
say that the Joker is beyond rehabilitation,
I also don't think that's fair. We don't know

47
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:21,132
if the Joker is going to kill again. I mean,
he's insane, which also means you can't kill

48
00:04:21,172 --> 00:04:26,013
the guy. He's not responsible in a way for his
own actions. We just need to help him control

49
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:31,295
those. You say that you're unsure as to whether
or not the Joker will kill again? I will literally

50
00:04:31,335 --> 00:04:38,097
place every cent I own on a wager that he will
in the comic books. Our next honorable mention

51
00:04:38,137 --> 00:04:46,740
goes to Mike Croft, who said, and Batman definitely
should not kill the Joker because anyone who

52
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:52,182
knows the injustice storyline sees what happens
to Superman after he decides to cross that

53
00:04:52,222 --> 00:04:59,005
line and the last thing we need is a Batman
who goes on murder sprees. Yeah and injustice

54
00:04:59,025 --> 00:05:03,367
was a perfect example for why heroes should
not be killing because once a hero makes that

55
00:05:03,407 --> 00:05:08,389
exception for their rule of not killing then
why not just kill any villain? That's so stupid.

56
00:05:08,429 --> 00:05:13,455
Why not just become a complete authoritarian?
That shit is so black and white, it's ridiculous.

57
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:18,498
DC really needs to get over this black and white
shit, which is another reason why I think Batman

58
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:22,960
should kill the Joker, to show that there actually
are shades of gray in the world. Just because

59
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,702
you make an exception for one mass murderer
doesn't mean you need to make an exception

60
00:05:26,742 --> 00:05:30,524
for everyone who ever commits a crime ever.
Like if you need to be that black and white,

61
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:35,707
then set a limit. Once you kill 100 people,
guess what? Your ass gets killed by Batman,

62
00:05:35,727 --> 00:05:40,362
okay? And we all know the Joker has killed well
more than 100 people, so just do that. if you're

63
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,804
incapable of making decisions that aren't like-
No, because then it's gonna be like, oh, well

64
00:05:43,824 --> 00:05:47,827
wouldn't it be better if I just like limit that
to like, if they kill 50 people? That'll make

65
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:52,450
my life a lot easier, right? That's not how
it works. Why? It's a shade of gray, why not?

66
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:58,014
Okay. All I know is that Captain America will
put a fool down and do so with good judgment.

67
00:05:58,434 --> 00:06:03,178
Next honorable mention goes to Michael Haggerty,
who says- Hi guys, Michael Haggerty here. Uh,

68
00:06:03,198 --> 00:06:11,986
I'm gonna say yes, he should, but, um, not for
like any other reason. than to see what Batman

69
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:16,709
is without Joker? Because we've seen what happens
to Joker when there's no Batman in the case

70
00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:22,591
of The Dark Knight Returns. So what happens
to the Batman then if there is no Joker, if

71
00:06:22,631 --> 00:06:27,773
there's no that opposite side of the coin? Does
he make his focus on more of a different supervillain?

72
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:33,819
I 100% agree with this answer. I think this
is a fantastic answer. Do it for nothing less

73
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:39,380
than the story. It would be so great to see
what happens to Batman, the fallout, the consequences

74
00:06:39,601 --> 00:06:44,142
of his actions if he chooses in fact to kill
the Joker, because it's not something that's

75
00:06:44,222 --> 00:06:48,643
ever been done in the comics. And if you're
like really concerned about a Batman universe

76
00:06:48,663 --> 00:06:52,604
without the Joker, guess what? It's comic books.
They could bring the Joker back as villains,

77
00:06:52,744 --> 00:06:57,846
always come back. So just do it for the story.
Well, I was going to say like we've seen what

78
00:06:57,886 --> 00:07:02,729
Batman is like with the Joker dead. The Joker
has died in a few like elseworld tales, like

79
00:07:02,749 --> 00:07:08,173
the Dark Knight Returns. You know Batman kept
being Batman and in justice Batman kept being

80
00:07:08,233 --> 00:07:12,936
Batman. There's always new threats for him to
face. There's always new crime. So I don't

81
00:07:12,976 --> 00:07:17,960
think he would ever stop being Batman just because
the Joker was dead. But in terms of seeing

82
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,403
what would happen to Bruce Wayne if he killed
Joker, we've seen that as well in the Batman

83
00:07:22,423 --> 00:07:27,835
Who Laughs. It breaks him. It breaks Bruce Wayne.
You know, Batman killing the Joker is what

84
00:07:27,855 --> 00:07:32,798
the Joker has always wanted. Because he knows
that Batman has such a staunch moral code,

85
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:38,322
that if he violated that, it would destroy him
mentally. And basically turn him into the Joker.

86
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:44,726
What a freaking loser. What? You don't call
Batman a loser? Are you saying that his moral

87
00:07:44,746 --> 00:07:50,170
code is so fucking rigid, that he can't violate
it once without falling apart at the seams?

88
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:55,846
That's ridiculous. That's a strong man. People
are like, Batman has this moral code. and he's

89
00:07:55,866 --> 00:08:01,271
like a role model to kids and stuff like that.
And I'm like, what kid out there is not killing

90
00:08:01,311 --> 00:08:06,176
people just because Batman doesn't kill people?
He's not a moral figure. Oh, me. He's a freaking

91
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,920
fictional character. I don't know, we'll see
when the time comes, you know? But if kids

92
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,801
start killing people, that shit's on you, dude.

93
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:19,192
That's all of our honorable mentions. We want
to give a big thank you to Brandon Estregard,

94
00:08:19,553 --> 00:08:26,657
Frank, Dustin Balkam, Tyson Lee, Michael Harreld,
Evan Tomke, Markey High, and Corey Wooten for

95
00:08:26,697 --> 00:08:32,521
giving such fantastic answers. But the winner
of this week's No Prize is... Meggy Mathengian

96
00:08:32,822 --> 00:08:37,044
who said, Hey guys, it's me and I don't think
Batman should kill the Joker because all life

97
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:42,048
is sacred and everybody has a chance for redemption,
even someone as evil as him. I get the utilitarian

98
00:08:42,068 --> 00:08:45,835
point of view, but I don't think that justifies
killing. there's a better way to stop evil.

99
00:08:46,355 --> 00:08:50,579
I think if one focuses on developing good character
instead of the consequences of their action,

100
00:08:50,979 --> 00:08:54,622
then the right choices will naturally follow.
I think Bruce is morally sound enough that

101
00:08:54,642 --> 00:08:59,006
he's doing the right thing. You either die a
hero or live long enough to see yourself become

102
00:08:59,046 --> 00:09:04,871
the villain. What an act line for this whole
debate. Batman should not become the villain.

103
00:09:05,292 --> 00:09:11,037
Batman should not stoop to the level of villainy
by murdering people. Everyone sees the Joker

104
00:09:11,077 --> 00:09:15,183
as a murderer. You should just be seeing him
as a human because that's what he is. When

105
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:20,945
you dehumanize your enemy, then there's no limits
to what atrocities you yourself could commit

106
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:26,368
against them. We're not dehumanizing him. He
has dehumanized himself through his own actions

107
00:09:26,468 --> 00:09:32,350
against his fellow man. Which one of us is not
capable of committing atrocities? Me, I'm not.

108
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:36,972
We all make it do that shit. Not that shit.
You could do other shit that's bad, right?

109
00:09:37,272 --> 00:09:41,706
So like, who are you to cast the first stone?
Oh, I could cast a stone against the Joker

110
00:09:41,886 --> 00:09:46,597
given that I've never killed anybody. Yet, that
we know of. What?

111
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:54,572
Mickey was talking about how there's always
a better way to defeat evil. Why hasn't Batman

112
00:09:54,612 --> 00:09:58,814
found that way? Why does he keep doing the dumb
thing of putting Joker back in Arkham Asylum

113
00:09:58,934 --> 00:10:04,858
over and over again when it proves to be ineffective?
Is that not the definition of insanity? Batman

114
00:10:04,978 --> 00:10:09,440
is a little bit insane, but also I think the
important note here is that the Joker is quite

115
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:15,583
possibly smarter than Batman or freaking anyone
else in Gotham. He finds a way to escape despite

116
00:10:15,623 --> 00:10:19,958
their best efforts. And if you think Batman
isn't trying to keep him in there, You are

117
00:10:19,998 --> 00:10:24,823
wrong, my friend. Arkham Asylum is a piece of
shit facility. It's like falling down. What?

118
00:10:24,983 --> 00:10:29,068
Like freaking throw Joker in the Phantom Zone
or something like that. That's basically worse

119
00:10:29,108 --> 00:10:37,117
than death. Good. Alright. That's the perfect
compromise then, right? Something worse than

120
00:10:37,157 --> 00:10:42,261
death, but he's still alive. So there's no murdering,
but he's still forever trapped in a hell of

121
00:10:42,281 --> 00:10:47,385
his own making. I think that's the way to go.
Did you not see what happened in Lego Batman?

122
00:10:47,585 --> 00:10:52,870
Joker went into the Phantom Zone and got fucking
Voldemort and Sauron and King Kong. That's

123
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:57,513
fucking Lego Batman. That's what would happen.
That's stupid. That's what would happen. Congrats

124
00:10:57,613 --> 00:11:01,597
once again to Miggie. You win this week's No
Prize if you the listener want a shot at winning

125
00:11:01,637 --> 00:11:05,993
your own No Prize. Stay tuned to later on in
this episode when we will be asking another

126
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:09,677
question of the week. And now that that's done,
on to the news!

127
00:11:15,298 --> 00:11:20,141
Alright, as we reported a few months ago, I
think back in July, I believe end of July,

128
00:11:20,482 --> 00:11:26,066
we learned that Scarlett Johansson filed a lawsuit
against Disney regarding her earnings for the

129
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:31,110
Black Widow movie. Basically, her contract stipulated
that the film would only be released in theaters

130
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:36,214
and then Disney released it day and date on
the Disney Plus streaming app alongside theaters.

131
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,878
And she wasn't happy about that because her
salary was in part determined by the overall

132
00:11:40,898 --> 00:11:45,502
theatrical box office of the film. And since
Black Widow didn't earn as much. in theaters

133
00:11:45,542 --> 00:11:49,924
because of the streaming release. She was trying
to get what she felt was owed her. Yeah, she

134
00:11:49,944 --> 00:11:55,227
was trying to get some Disney Plus money. Yeah.
Now, back then, Jonathan and I kind of speculated

135
00:11:55,647 --> 00:12:00,110
that this whole thing might turn into a giant
paradigm shift where like Disney Plus and all

136
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:04,352
the other streaming services are going to have
to reveal their data to the public and how

137
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:08,214
that might affect the productions that they
put out there and how much they pay talent.

138
00:12:08,615 --> 00:12:13,377
But all that speculation was largely moot due
to the news this past week that Disney has

139
00:12:13,457 --> 00:12:18,432
settled. with Scarlett Johansson. We're not
sure about the numbers, but it's no less than

140
00:12:18,492 --> 00:12:23,775
40 million, according to reports. And this sucks,
honestly, I think, because I was really hoping

141
00:12:23,795 --> 00:12:27,717
that we were gonna go the distance and really
get those numbers. But, you know, that's a

142
00:12:27,857 --> 00:12:32,720
huge can of worms that I don't think any of
the streaming platforms are ready to put out

143
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:37,703
there. So Disney really had no choice but to
settle. And you know, there's precedent for

144
00:12:37,763 --> 00:12:43,774
it. We know that HBO Max avoided potential lawsuits
like this by paying out. the talent for films

145
00:12:43,815 --> 00:12:48,418
like Wonder Woman 1984 and other movies. Yeah,
and the same thing with Emma Stone and Disney

146
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:53,763
for Cruella. Right. So basically it was kind
of a case of greed on both sides. The thing

147
00:12:53,883 --> 00:12:59,848
is that Disney has so much more money as a corporation
than Scarlett Johansson. So, you know, Scarlett

148
00:12:59,868 --> 00:13:04,131
was considered the underdog in this whole affair,
especially considering some of the dickhead

149
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:08,775
comments that Disney made, like calling her
callous for bringing this up during like a

150
00:13:08,815 --> 00:13:13,122
pandemic, and revealing her salary that she
got for the film. You know, yeah, that was

151
00:13:13,202 --> 00:13:18,207
lame. They created a PR nightmare for themselves
where they had really no choice once the hearing

152
00:13:18,247 --> 00:13:22,570
started, but to try to, you know, pay this away.
Yeah. They were probably literally like, how

153
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:28,035
much is going to cost to make this all disappear?
Scarlett. But you know, despite all the shit

154
00:13:28,055 --> 00:13:32,398
talking that was going on, mostly on Disney
side, it seems like everybody's cordial with

155
00:13:32,418 --> 00:13:36,001
each other now. You know, Scarlett Johansson
is talking about how great it is to work for

156
00:13:36,062 --> 00:13:40,105
Disney and Disney's talking about how great
it is to have Scarlett Johansson as part of

157
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:44,863
their talent. Right. She's going to end up making
a Tower of Terror with them still. Yeah. Which

158
00:13:44,883 --> 00:13:48,185
was surprising to me. I didn't think that was
going to happen. Yeah. And maybe we'll even

159
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:53,507
get future appearances from her in the MCU.
If they ever decide to bring her back, you

160
00:13:53,527 --> 00:13:56,888
know, maybe for a Black Widow 2 or something
like that, they can find a way to do that,

161
00:13:56,928 --> 00:14:01,650
especially with the reveal of the multiverse
within the MCU. Yeah. Yeah, that's true. In

162
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:06,573
other Marvel news, we got an updated synopsis
for Eternals, which is coming out in just a

163
00:14:06,633 --> 00:14:11,171
month, which is super soon. You know, we already
got the final trailer that was released a few

164
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:16,075
weeks ago, and it looks like Marvel is trying
to keep the marketing train going by revealing

165
00:14:16,095 --> 00:14:19,877
a little bit more information about the movie,
since it seems like people still have a lot

166
00:14:19,917 --> 00:14:24,220
of questions about it. Yeah, it's a huge mystery
still, I think. Part of that mystery has been

167
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:29,844
revealed with this new description, which reads,
The Eternals takes place across two time periods.

168
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:34,928
One storyline is set in the past when they operated
as a formidable team and a close family unit.

169
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:39,751
The second storyline is in the present. when
the group is fractured and split apart, can

170
00:14:39,811 --> 00:14:44,874
tend to live among humans hiding in plain sight.
The prevailing threat of the Deviants, which

171
00:14:44,974 --> 00:14:49,937
once again threatens the existence of mankind,
means the Eternals need to put their differences

172
00:14:49,977 --> 00:14:55,600
aside and regroup. So basically it's gonna be
a story of superhero family drama. Where they

173
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,063
were once close, something split them all apart
to leave their separate lives and now they're

174
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:05,250
gonna have to reconcile to face this new Deviant
threat with the approaching Celestials. This

175
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:09,572
synopsis was a huge surprise to me. I thought
the film would probably show kind of what happened

176
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:14,395
in the past, just in flashback, just to set
the story up with the majority of the story

177
00:15:14,495 --> 00:15:18,278
sort of happening in modern day, but it kind
of sounds like they're going to be swapping

178
00:15:18,438 --> 00:15:22,821
between present and the past throughout the
movie, which is really interesting. Yeah. I've

179
00:15:22,861 --> 00:15:27,364
always been a big fan of nonlinear narratives.
I think there's a lot of opportunity to get

180
00:15:27,424 --> 00:15:32,623
creative when you don't tell a story in chronological
order. In addition to this new synopsis, Marvel

181
00:15:32,703 --> 00:15:37,987
also released a new TV spot called Protect,
which featured a lot of new footage from the

182
00:15:38,007 --> 00:15:42,671
movie. It was about 30 seconds long, but we
got some really cool action beats here, including

183
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:48,396
seeing Angelina Jolie's, Thena in action. We
see more of Icarus's eye beams. We also got

184
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:53,220
to look at a new deviant monster that we hadn't
seen before. It looks kind of like a flying

185
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,824
squid kind of thing. A lot of tentacles. It's
really crazy. The designs on these deviants

186
00:15:57,844 --> 00:16:01,679
are just out of this world, but not actually.
because they were actually created here. It

187
00:16:01,739 --> 00:16:05,922
is a delicate balance between revealing enough
to the public so that they're enticed to see

188
00:16:05,942 --> 00:16:10,785
the film, but not revealing so much so that
they feel like they have a good idea of what

189
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:15,829
the plot line is overall. Marvel has definitely
given away too much in their trailers before,

190
00:16:16,069 --> 00:16:20,672
like with that man and the Wasp, but they definitely
didn't give too much away with like the Avengers

191
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:25,355
endgame campaign. Right. And I think the Eternals
campaign is kind of following the latter's

192
00:16:25,395 --> 00:16:29,612
approach. Yeah, yeah, it seems that way. But
speaking of the Eternals, That brings us to

193
00:16:29,632 --> 00:16:30,595
our question of the week.

194
00:16:35,042 --> 00:16:40,904
Who is your favorite Marvel or DC character
created or partially created by Jack Kirby

195
00:16:41,144 --> 00:16:46,466
and why? Yeah, Jack King Kirby was a big time
creator during the Golden Age and Silver Age

196
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:51,088
of comics. He created so many of the characters
that we know and love from Marvel and DC. The

197
00:16:51,148 --> 00:16:55,290
Eternals being some of those characters that
he created. So we'd like to hear your thoughts

Special thanks to HBO Max for sponsoring this
episode. And now let's go ahead and get into

216
00:18:38,394 --> 00:18:43,100
our main event where we review the latest Marvel
and Sony film to have hit theaters, Venom,

217
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,301
Let There Be Carnage.

218
00:18:59,594 --> 00:19:05,716
Alright Venom Let There Be Carnage was directed
by Andy Serkis and stars Tom Hardy, Woody Harrelson,

219
00:19:05,776 --> 00:19:11,199
Michelle Williams, Naomi Harris, and Stephen
Graham. Now if you have not watched the movie,

220
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:16,982
this will be a spoiler review as all of our
reviews are, so if you're interested in possibly

221
00:19:17,082 --> 00:19:21,824
seeing this film, I would suggest not listening
further because we will give away the entire

222
00:19:21,864 --> 00:19:27,355
plot of the movie in our discussion of it. That
being said... I don't necessarily recommend

223
00:19:27,435 --> 00:19:31,818
this film. If you are a fan of the original,
it's likely that you'll have more of an appreciation

224
00:19:32,178 --> 00:19:37,462
of the sequel. But if you didn't care for 2018's
Venom movie, I would just say give this one

225
00:19:37,482 --> 00:19:41,485
a skip or wait until it's on streaming. Yeah,
I mean, I didn't really care about the first

226
00:19:41,545 --> 00:19:45,868
Venom movie. I thought it was kind of a step
back for the genre actually. And I feel the

227
00:19:45,888 --> 00:19:49,970
same way about this film. It's like a step back
from a step back, you know, I would have much

228
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:55,230
preferred to have not seen this in theaters.
To me, this is totally a streaming film. Unfortunately,

229
00:19:55,290 --> 00:20:00,032
Sony doesn't have their own streaming platform
upon which they could have released this. So

230
00:20:00,072 --> 00:20:04,154
we were all kind of forced to see it in the
theater. And it's doing really well, actually.

231
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:10,017
Yeah, it's actually broken this year's three
day opening weekend record, beating out Black

232
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:16,140
Widow by about 10 million dollars. So regardless
of what we say about this film, the franchise

233
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,331
is definitely going to continue because it is
so popular. I think a franchise continuing

234
00:20:21,371 --> 00:20:25,514
is always a good thing because whether or not
the previous movie was garbage, there's at

235
00:20:25,554 --> 00:20:31,578
least a chance to improve there. The first Vandom
movie came out in 2018. We gave that film 3.5

236
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:37,263
stars saying it had its problems but overall
we found it entertaining. And while there was

237
00:20:37,343 --> 00:20:41,686
little to praise about that film other than
Tom Hardy's performance and the serviceable

238
00:20:41,806 --> 00:20:46,529
action, I still felt like the first film did
a decent job of establishing the franchise.

239
00:20:46,826 --> 00:20:51,147
And I still feel that way. I rewatched the first
movie right before seeing Let There Be Carnage,

240
00:20:51,528 --> 00:20:56,170
and I'm really glad I did because not only is
it a fun movie, but seeing the sequel immediately

241
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:02,112
after just made it so very clear to me that
the sequel really leans into what made the

242
00:21:02,192 --> 00:21:07,935
first movie merely mediocre and just doubled
down on that. Venom, Let There Be Carnage is

243
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:14,017
not a disaster by any means, but it lacks an
interesting plot. It's borderline goofy at

244
00:21:14,077 --> 00:21:18,601
times. It doesn't have a whole lot of characterization
outside of the main protagonist. It failed

245
00:21:18,641 --> 00:21:24,446
to do the source material justice, definitely.
And really it's just too short of a film. Yeah,

246
00:21:24,486 --> 00:21:28,589
I cannot believe how short this film was. Like
when it ended, I was like, what? We're like

247
00:21:28,609 --> 00:21:32,372
already at the close of the third act. What
the hell happened? Yeah, the movie is just

248
00:21:32,552 --> 00:21:37,616
over 90 minutes, like an hour and a half. But
it also doesn't feel like the studio left a

249
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:41,560
lot on the cutting room floor. You know, it
just feels like they didn't have enough story

250
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,911
to tell basically. Exactly. Yeah, totally. And
surprisingly, it was Tom Hardy that wrote the

251
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:53,354
script alongside Kelly Marcel. What? I did not
know that. Yeah. Wow. I would have expected

252
00:21:53,554 --> 00:21:58,056
much more of an effort from him, I guess. Yeah,
me too. I was going to go into this sort of

253
00:21:58,096 --> 00:22:02,819
blaming the studio, saying, you know, once again,
it's a studio not respecting their characters,

254
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:06,961
not knowing enough about their characters. But
it's kind of hard to say that now knowing that

255
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:11,900
Tom Hardy was the writer. Yeah, I don't know
if he's written previous efforts before, but

256
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,024
I'll definitely say he did a better job of acting
in this film than writing it. Because the story

257
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:22,069
is mostly a series of character building moments
for Eddie and Venom, with the plot's driving

258
00:22:22,189 --> 00:22:27,993
elements revolving around Cletus gaining the
symbiote and attempting to kill the hero. It's

259
00:22:28,054 --> 00:22:33,018
not a complex story, like the prime conflict
for the protagonist is basically this tug of

260
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:38,078
war of whether or not he should be a crime fighter,
which is never interesting to see. and the

261
00:22:38,118 --> 00:22:43,021
fact that Carnage is the driving force is disappointing
since they really dropped the ball in terms

262
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:49,006
of developing Cletus Kasady. By the time the
film ends and Cletus dies, I honestly felt

263
00:22:49,046 --> 00:22:53,649
like I barely even knew the character. There
was so much wasted potential in regards to

264
00:22:53,689 --> 00:22:58,873
Carnage who, if you listened to our last episode,
had so much more background to pull from. The

265
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:04,377
film could and should have explored the origin
of these alien Klintar symbiotes and their

266
00:23:04,397 --> 00:23:08,899
means of reproduction. They definitely, I think,
had the space to do that in this movie. We

267
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:13,641
should have also witnessed the relationship
between Cletus and Carnage and how it compared

268
00:23:13,721 --> 00:23:17,743
to any of Venom. I don't think we got nearly
enough of that. We also didn't get enough of

269
00:23:17,763 --> 00:23:21,364
the relationship between Venom and Carnage.
You know, in the comics, it's established that

270
00:23:21,404 --> 00:23:26,747
there's an innate antagonism that Clint are
have among their kin, but we didn't get any

271
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:31,569
explanation of that here. Yeah, you're right.
Like, I have no idea how Carnage even came

272
00:23:31,609 --> 00:23:36,231
about. Like, if anyone bites Eddie. Are they
gonna get like a new carnage symbiote in them?

273
00:23:36,471 --> 00:23:41,093
Like, they didn't get to the reproduction aspect
at all. They could have totally made this a

274
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:46,295
normal runtime film just by adding those essential
bits. Ultimately, I think one of the biggest

275
00:23:46,315 --> 00:23:51,177
disappointments was that we should have been
truly afraid of Cletus Kasady, you know, who's

276
00:23:51,237 --> 00:23:56,819
not just a serial killer, but in fact a mass
murderer. And yeah, this film is PG-13 and

277
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:00,721
it has to stay that way because eventually it's
gonna be folded into the Spider-Man franchise.

278
00:24:01,181 --> 00:24:06,011
I get that. But there are ways to portray a
character of that dangerous and disturbing

279
00:24:06,051 --> 00:24:11,132
nature that don't need explicit violence. Yeah.
Just have it happen like in the dark or like

280
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:15,733
off frame. Just like, show some blood splatter
or something like that. Right. Yeah. I mean,

281
00:24:15,853 --> 00:24:19,775
look at characters like Heath Ledger's Joker,
you know, the dark night was a PG-13 movie

282
00:24:19,815 --> 00:24:24,856
and he was horrifying. Yeah. Look at other PG-13
films like the ring and what you can get away

283
00:24:24,876 --> 00:24:30,670
with there of a horrific nature, you know, the
PG-13 rating does have some leeway. and this

284
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:35,853
film just didn't capitalize on it, which they
needed to do, I think, for a character like

285
00:24:35,953 --> 00:24:41,036
Carnage. They just left him as kind of bland
overall, really. Like, I don't get the movie's

286
00:24:41,076 --> 00:24:46,279
choice to turn Cletus into this lovesick clown,
as opposed to this scary figure, because he

287
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:51,382
enjoys killing. That's what makes him scary.
That's what I didn't get from this film. There

288
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:56,544
are so many times during this movie when I was
watching this, just expecting Carnage to just

289
00:24:56,564 --> 00:25:01,937
like kill anyone he came across. Instead, we
got Woody Harrelson in a weird haircut. So

290
00:25:01,957 --> 00:25:07,542
bizarre. Yeah, Carnage is sometimes described
as being as violent and insane as the Joker.

291
00:25:08,102 --> 00:25:13,387
And I don't understand why the filmmakers wouldn't
have taken Joaquin Phoenix or what Heath Ledger

292
00:25:13,407 --> 00:25:18,532
did with the Joker as inspiration. Woody Harrelson
is every bit the actor as Heath Ledger and

293
00:25:18,572 --> 00:25:23,776
Joaquin Phoenix. And that's so disappointing
that they didn't do more with him. The movie

294
00:25:23,816 --> 00:25:28,452
was, frankly, cheesy at times when it came to
the villains and some of the side characters,

295
00:25:28,772 --> 00:25:33,715
even the Eddie and Venom dynamic. What made
the first film interesting is that they really

296
00:25:33,775 --> 00:25:39,358
towed the line with the humor. Like it presented
Venom not just as an amusing creature, but

297
00:25:39,438 --> 00:25:44,081
a dangerous one. Like when he told Eddie to
rip off these guys' heads and pile the bodies

298
00:25:44,101 --> 00:25:50,265
and heads in the corner of the room, it was
like, what? That's hilarious and scary. You

299
00:25:50,285 --> 00:25:55,275
know? The first movie balanced really well the
amount of jokes we were willing to tolerate

300
00:25:55,335 --> 00:26:00,958
from a threatening monster villain. But in this
sequel, Venom was pretty much a teddy bear.

301
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:05,880
You know, he was totally non-threatening, almost
always being played for laughs. I think they

302
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,622
leaned way too heavily on the humor, probably
thinking that's what audiences loved the most

303
00:26:10,662 --> 00:26:15,224
about the first film. Yeah, he freaking went
to a rave and everyone thought he just was

304
00:26:15,244 --> 00:26:19,530
like the coolest guy there. I was like, shouldn't
he be like trying to eat everyone? Shouldn't

305
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:25,274
they be horrified by him? Yeah, totally. Venom
should be threatening and scary. First and

306
00:26:25,314 --> 00:26:30,859
foremost, with only like the occasional hint
of whimsy as a means of subversion and interest,

307
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:37,684
never ever in my whole life have I ever wanted
to see Venom flip pancakes while singing or

308
00:26:37,724 --> 00:26:44,010
wear glow sticks at a rave. He's almost a parody
of himself in this movie. Make him scary first,

309
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:49,718
jokes later, if at all. Yeah, for every like
turds in the wind kind of joke. we should definitely

310
00:26:49,738 --> 00:26:55,619
be seeing like a decapitation or two. Right,
exactly, like the first movie. Beyond the story

311
00:26:55,639 --> 00:27:00,701
and the humor, I didn't feel this sequel brought
anything new to the table visually that the

312
00:27:00,741 --> 00:27:05,782
original film didn't have. I thought the end
fight with Carnage was not necessarily better

313
00:27:05,822 --> 00:27:09,963
than the end fight with Riot. They were actually
kind of similar, but I found the fight with

314
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:15,285
Carnage to be even more of a confusing CGI fest.
There were just like so many tentacles flying

315
00:27:15,305 --> 00:27:18,894
all over the place. The action was a little
bit undiscernible. And I thought Carnage was

316
00:27:18,914 --> 00:27:23,197
gonna use his powers in all kinds of cool ways
because Venom was like, oh shit That's a red

317
00:27:23,357 --> 00:27:27,901
one But really he didn't get too creative with
his powers the movie should have explained

318
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:33,805
what a red one actually meant Exactly and why
he was red why there was an apparent lack of

319
00:27:33,845 --> 00:27:38,208
symbiosis between Carnage and Cletus Because
it didn't look that way to me like the way

320
00:27:38,268 --> 00:27:43,692
Cletus would visually Morph into carnage as
opposed to being covered up by him like how

321
00:27:43,732 --> 00:27:49,116
Eddie is covered up by venom, right? The transformation
seemed to imply that Cletus and Carnage had

322
00:27:49,236 --> 00:27:54,980
a more cellular level of bonding, like in the
comics. But then the film contradicts its visual

323
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:00,143
cues with dialogue about how Cletus and Carnage
were less connected, which felt wrong to me

324
00:28:00,163 --> 00:28:04,186
because Cletus and Carnage in the comics are
essentially one and the same. Yeah, yeah, it

325
00:28:04,206 --> 00:28:09,430
seemed that way based on our last episode compared
to what I learned in our Venom vs. Clayface

326
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:15,206
episode. Like Eddie, Brock, and Venom are separate
entities, where Cletus Kasady is Carnage. So

327
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:19,228
they kind of dropped the ball there. But with
all that negativity aside, I know I probably

328
00:28:19,268 --> 00:28:23,190
sound disappointed in this movie because I kind
of was. But Jonathan, tell me something good

329
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:27,732
about this film. What did you like about this
movie? Let's get some positivity in here. It

330
00:28:27,792 --> 00:28:34,476
is a good popcorn film in that its merits are
pretty much solely based on entertainment and

331
00:28:34,496 --> 00:28:41,059
just having a fun, good time. I did legit laugh
a number of times at the jokes and just the

332
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:45,702
character of Venom. Yeah, I'll say this movie
is funnier than the first one. Yeah, I think

333
00:28:45,742 --> 00:28:50,065
I could guarantee that you will be smiling in
the theater if you see it there. You know,

334
00:28:50,225 --> 00:28:55,108
everyone harps on how Venom should not be comedic,
and I actually agree with them. That didn't

335
00:28:55,188 --> 00:28:59,590
stop me from laughing, though. If Tom Hardy
wrote some of these jokes, Tom Hardy is a funny

336
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:03,853
guy. Let's go ahead and talk about that in our
character breakdown. You know, Eddie Brock

337
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:09,036
and Venom were both played by Tom Hardy. I think
he gave a great performance here, as he usually

338
00:29:09,096 --> 00:29:13,783
does. Tom Hardy is just a brilliant actor. And
I think he's this film saving grace, much like

339
00:29:13,823 --> 00:29:18,645
how he was the best thing about the first film.
But I'll say again that it is hard to watch

340
00:29:18,745 --> 00:29:24,388
a movie where the primary conflict for the hero
is whether or not he wants to be a hero. You

341
00:29:24,408 --> 00:29:29,371
know, we kind of touched upon that for our Luke
Cage season one review. Like, we know these

342
00:29:29,411 --> 00:29:35,174
characters as being someone who will fight crime.
And when it takes like two movies to get the

343
00:29:35,194 --> 00:29:39,697
character to that point, it can get a little
bit exhausting. Oh, totally. Yeah, absolutely.

344
00:29:39,797 --> 00:29:44,272
This whole film, I was just like... Listen to
Venom, dude. Be that lethal protector. Yeah,

345
00:29:44,332 --> 00:29:48,035
well, I mean, that's where we thought his character
was at the end of the first movie, you know,

346
00:29:48,095 --> 00:29:53,358
because at the end he ended up killing the convenience
store robber who's threatening Mrs. Chen. I

347
00:29:53,378 --> 00:29:57,241
thought he was going to start off this movie
at that point, but it seems like his character

348
00:29:57,281 --> 00:30:01,424
backslid a little bit where he was still a little
bit uncertain as to what his purpose was with

349
00:30:01,464 --> 00:30:05,267
the symbiote. And that should have been something
that like maybe even Carnage played upon. I

350
00:30:05,287 --> 00:30:09,166
mean, like, you know, you're getting mad at
me for killing people, but look at you. Are

351
00:30:09,206 --> 00:30:12,808
you a hypocrite? Oh yeah, they totally could
have done that. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. That

352
00:30:12,828 --> 00:30:17,931
would have been a great arc for him to justify
to himself why he is the better man, so to

353
00:30:17,971 --> 00:30:23,194
speak, despite the fact that he's an anti-hero.
It writes itself, man. I guess the better man

354
00:30:23,234 --> 00:30:27,517
is not a good of phrase as the lesser of two
evils, which is what venom is supposed to be,

355
00:30:27,777 --> 00:30:32,416
absolutely. At the end of this movie, we see
Eddie Brock come to the same realization that

356
00:30:32,457 --> 00:30:36,840
he learned at the end of the first movie, which
is kind of accepting his circumstances as being

357
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:42,345
bonded to this creature and, you know, ready
to set out and fight bad guys. Venom also had

358
00:30:42,385 --> 00:30:46,348
an arc here, although it was a little bit strange,
you know, like at the rave, he was talking

359
00:30:46,388 --> 00:30:50,892
about alien rights and stuff. It seemed like
he wanted to be respected more than anything

360
00:30:50,952 --> 00:30:55,876
else. The whole film was kind of like an odd
couple tale between Eddie Brock and Venom.

361
00:30:56,196 --> 00:30:59,919
Like it was almost like they were in a relationship.
And this was the story of their breakup and

362
00:30:59,939 --> 00:31:03,821
how they got back together and learned to like
respect one each other and accept that they're

363
00:31:03,881 --> 00:31:09,705
right for each other. Yeah, and that is an interesting
primary conflict. Too bad that the whole thing

364
00:31:09,825 --> 00:31:15,308
just got resolved with a mere apology. It was
basically Venom saying, you got to apologize

365
00:31:15,408 --> 00:31:19,811
and then Eddie apologizing and then them being
cool with the whole central conflict of their

366
00:31:19,851 --> 00:31:24,293
story here, you know. Yeah, it was all kind
of played for laughs. There was no grand gesture.

367
00:31:24,654 --> 00:31:30,377
There was no moment of cathartic realization
or anything like that is just very unsatisfying.

368
00:31:30,837 --> 00:31:35,339
And now that you mentioned it, like what was
to stop Venom from going out and fighting crime

369
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:39,261
and eating people in those other bodies? Like
why didn't he do it then? Like why did he even

370
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:43,704
need to go to Mrs. Chen for chocolate? Why wasn't
he eating people right off the bat? That's

371
00:31:43,724 --> 00:31:48,146
a good question. We do know that those other
bodies that he was in weren't sustainable because

372
00:31:48,166 --> 00:31:51,408
like as the first movie explained, it's kind
of like an organ transplant kind of thing.

373
00:31:51,528 --> 00:31:56,558
The symbiote has to be a match with the host.
So He may not have been able to sustain himself

374
00:31:56,678 --> 00:32:00,919
being attached to those hosts despite eating
other people. That's the only reason I could

375
00:32:00,939 --> 00:32:07,061
give. Hmm. Let's move on to Cletus Kasady and
Carnage, both played by Woody Harrelson. A

376
00:32:07,081 --> 00:32:10,582
lot of people may not know that Woody Harrelson
also provided the voice for Carnage in this

377
00:32:10,642 --> 00:32:16,144
film. I myself thought the voice was a little
bit too deep, and I don't know if I'm just

378
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:20,905
being conditioned by the Spider-Man animated
television series, but in that show, his voice

379
00:32:20,925 --> 00:32:25,766
was a lot more like... high pitched and layered
a little bit, you know, frightening. But as

380
00:32:25,786 --> 00:32:31,128
far as Woody Harrelson's Cletus Kasady, I think
he did as well as he could have. On paper,

381
00:32:31,428 --> 00:32:36,969
it should have been perfect. But the problem,
I think, was what was actually on paper. There's

382
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:40,771
only so much for him to work with based off
of the script that he was given. He seemed

383
00:32:40,831 --> 00:32:45,832
so much less unhinged here than he did in the
after credit scene for the first Venom film.

384
00:32:46,072 --> 00:32:49,993
There, like his performance was wild and like
his eyes were like popping out of his head

385
00:32:50,013 --> 00:32:55,135
and everything. And here he was just kind of
normal guy, you know? It was really weird toward

386
00:32:55,155 --> 00:32:59,856
the end of the film when Cletus was explaining
to Eddie how he was like so alone as a child

387
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:03,878
just wanting to be loved and how right before
he died he was like I just wanted to be your

388
00:33:03,918 --> 00:33:10,200
friend basically. It seemed like they were trying
to rationalize his horribly evil behavior and

389
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,030
while that's you know an interesting approach
to take with a lot of villains, I don't think

390
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:18,915
that's the right approach to take with Cletus
Kasady because he's freaking one of the most

391
00:33:19,175 --> 00:33:24,401
evil villains out there. You don't humanize
him. You make him an evil force of nature like

392
00:33:24,441 --> 00:33:31,128
the Joker. His is the sort of evil that needs
no rhyme or reason. It just is because he is

393
00:33:31,168 --> 00:33:36,770
chaos incarnate. Because some men just want
to watch the world burn. Exactly. It was kind

394
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:41,332
of cool in this movie, probably one of the more
interesting scenes of the film when they delve

395
00:33:41,472 --> 00:33:47,735
into Cletus's backstory via the use of animation.
It was kind of an interesting way to circumvent

396
00:33:47,815 --> 00:33:51,676
showing a lot of the violence of his past. Oh,
yeah. Yeah, if they would have filmed that

397
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:55,038
with like a real kid, that would have gotten
real dark. I'm sure Disney would have been

398
00:33:55,058 --> 00:34:00,020
like, no, we don't want venom in our film. Right,
right. But that animation was the most character

399
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:04,770
development that we got for Cletus. And ultimately,
I don't think it was enough. Let's move on

400
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:12,274
to Cletus's girlfriend, Frances Bereson, AKA
Shriek, who is played by Naomi Harris. What

401
00:34:12,314 --> 00:34:19,599
the fuck was this character? She was so bad.
Like Naomi Harris is a decent enough actress.

402
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:24,121
I like her in a lot of the stuff I've seen,
but sometimes she makes these really weird

403
00:34:24,181 --> 00:34:30,765
character decisions that play off so bad. She
did not need to be in the movie. Like you mentioned

404
00:34:30,805 --> 00:34:37,300
earlier, The whole thing with Cletus needing
like a love story angle was completely unnecessary.

405
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:42,382
It's like they only had her here because they
needed somebody who would be able to destroy

406
00:34:42,422 --> 00:34:46,504
both of the symbiotes, who had a power set of
that nature. Yeah, I mean I was thinking about

407
00:34:46,544 --> 00:34:50,786
that the whole time I was watching the movie.
Like, this is like the worst character to have

408
00:34:51,026 --> 00:34:55,608
Carnage fall in love with, even though I know
it's a precedent in the comics, because she

409
00:34:55,668 --> 00:35:00,482
is his weakness. It's like Superman falling
in love with a Kryptonite woman. and then getting

410
00:35:00,542 --> 00:35:05,466
pissed at her for being made out of kryptonite.
It's weird. Yeah, yeah. But in terms of the

411
00:35:05,506 --> 00:35:11,590
performance, like Naomi Harris was very inconsistent.
At times she had this like weird girly cartoony

412
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:17,374
voice. It was strange. I don't understand what
her motivations were, like why she was so hell

413
00:35:17,394 --> 00:35:21,878
bent on causing destruction. I don't get why
she like all of a sudden had a change of heart

414
00:35:21,898 --> 00:35:26,341
at the very end. And I was like, no, Carnage,
she's doing too much, blah, blah. That was

415
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:31,265
stupid. Like she just got done killing the guy
that she wanted to kill, allegedly killing,

416
00:35:31,325 --> 00:35:35,769
you know, Detective Patrick Mulligan. And then
only afterward she was like, this is too much.

417
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:40,213
And it's like, what are you talking about? Like
you knew this was all part of the plan. Like,

418
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:44,596
you know, Shriek, Carnage and Cletus, they were
all set out to get their revenge. If I wrote

419
00:35:44,616 --> 00:35:49,861
this film, Shriek would not be in it. Cletus
would have escaped from his execution and just

420
00:35:49,961 --> 00:35:55,205
gone on a killing spree. And that was the film.
Like Venom had to stop this killing spree.

421
00:35:55,634 --> 00:35:59,840
Yeah, and he would have had to have been a little
bit more creative in how he did that, considering

422
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:03,865
that they didn't have, you know, a built-in
failsafe with the shriek character. Who didn't

423
00:36:03,905 --> 00:36:08,091
see that coming a mile away? Everybody fucking
saw that. I also just want to point out that

424
00:36:08,131 --> 00:36:16,194
the worst line of this movie was when she was
like, peeps tried. Botched it. Ugh. Let's move

425
00:36:16,254 --> 00:36:20,997
on to Anne Wayne, who was played by Michelle
Williams. Kind of like the first movie, she

426
00:36:21,197 --> 00:36:25,079
was really just a supplemental character. She
didn't have too much bearing, except for the

427
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:29,081
cool moments where she got to don the symbiote
again. I really liked that they brought She-Venom

428
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:33,584
back, if only for a little bit, because I really
liked her appearance in the first movie. And

429
00:36:33,644 --> 00:36:38,967
I like that Anne likes being Venom. Anne she
still likes Eddie Brock, it seems, even though

430
00:36:38,987 --> 00:36:44,210
she can't handle his continual lying. I'm really
glad that the movie chose not. to pair those

431
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:48,531
two up together in the endo and keep Dan around
because I just don't think it would fit the

432
00:36:48,551 --> 00:36:52,673
characters for them to end up back together.
And I like Dr. Dan. It was nice that they gave

433
00:36:52,713 --> 00:36:57,155
him a little heroic moment here in the final
battle where he was pouring fire on the symbiotes.

434
00:36:57,635 --> 00:37:00,656
Yeah, I kind of get the feeling that this is
probably the last time we'll end up seeing

435
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:05,338
those two characters in the franchise, maybe,
but I think you've kind of done all you can

436
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:10,320
with them anyway, so. Yeah, yeah, I agree. The
last character that I want to talk about is

437
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:15,722
Steven Graham, who played Detective Patrick
Mulligan. He was generic cop, big deal, but

438
00:37:15,762 --> 00:37:20,985
every time he was on screen, I kept waiting
for hints toward Toxin. Because in the comics,

439
00:37:21,025 --> 00:37:27,047
he becomes Toxin. Wait, what? Yeah, Toxin is
Carnage's offspring. He's more powerful than

440
00:37:27,087 --> 00:37:31,989
Carnage and Venom combined. He has like these
poison claws. He's an okay character, but he

441
00:37:32,029 --> 00:37:36,491
ends up bonding to Detective Patrick Mulligan.
They didn't do anything with him until the

442
00:37:36,571 --> 00:37:41,733
very end of the movie, but it was so confusing
how they went about it. Because like Shriek

443
00:37:41,873 --> 00:37:46,388
killed him. Essentially or almost killed him
it like she tied this chain around his neck

444
00:37:46,608 --> 00:37:50,031
I thought she was gonna hang him, but she ended
up just like throwing him backward It was really

445
00:37:50,071 --> 00:37:55,134
bizarre and it turned out he didn't die and
he has glowing eyes why he has glowing guys

446
00:37:55,514 --> 00:37:59,957
Absolutely no idea because toxin himself doesn't
have glowing guys You know he looks like carnage

447
00:37:59,997 --> 00:38:05,261
on his top half and venom on his bottom half
I gotta say if he's the villain in another

448
00:38:05,381 --> 00:38:10,945
venom movie I'm not looking forward to that
at all like venom going up against another

449
00:38:11,005 --> 00:38:17,783
symbiote and like one who's played by an actor
as mediocre as this guy. I totally agree. It's

450
00:38:17,803 --> 00:38:22,645
like, oh, that's gonna sell tickets. Yeah. Considering
we've got Riot in the first film and Carnage

451
00:38:22,665 --> 00:38:26,946
in the second film, let's see something new
for the next film. Like maybe they go down

452
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:31,227
the route of Null and we finally get the history
on these alien symbiotes and things like that.

453
00:38:31,407 --> 00:38:35,068
That might be cool. And with that story, you
could even bring Carnage back and maybe do

454
00:38:35,088 --> 00:38:39,469
him justice this time. But definitely not Toxin.
I don't think he's a strong enough character

455
00:38:39,629 --> 00:38:43,635
for a third film. But let's go ahead and break
down the story highlights. So the film starts

456
00:38:43,695 --> 00:38:49,797
off in 1996. We see a young Cletus Kasady fall
in love with Frances Bereson at the St. Estes

457
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:55,159
home for unwanted children. She is a mutant
with a sonic scream who's taken to a special

458
00:38:55,179 --> 00:39:01,382
holding facility at the Ravencroft Institute.
The whole mention of mutation was really surprising

459
00:39:01,402 --> 00:39:06,704
to me. This was like the first time we've heard
anything about mutation since the X-Men films.

460
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:13,540
Yeah, and I have kind of mixed feelings about
this. On one hand, it is exciting to see that

461
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:18,204
they may be working toward mutants within the
multiverse or whatever. On the other hand,

462
00:39:18,364 --> 00:39:23,809
I really hate that she will be the introduction
to mutants, because Shriek in this movie just

463
00:39:23,869 --> 00:39:30,034
sucked. They're her peeps! They botched it!
I would have preferred if the introduction

464
00:39:30,074 --> 00:39:35,158
to mutants was just more impressive, I guess.
So en route to the Institute, Shriek nearly

465
00:39:35,218 --> 00:39:40,678
kills Patrick Mulligan, who was an officer helping
facilitate the transfer. He shoots Shriek in

466
00:39:40,698 --> 00:39:46,139
the eye and he believes he killed her, but she's
successfully transferred in secret. Which kind

467
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:50,901
of confused me later on in the movie. I'm wondering
why they kept her incarceration at Ravencroft

468
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:56,422
a secret, even to local authorities. Was it
just like a government, like secret experiment

469
00:39:56,802 --> 00:40:00,724
center? And maybe that's why it was off the
books. Like they were trying to keep mutation

470
00:40:00,744 --> 00:40:04,105
a secret. That's the only thing I could come
up with. It would have been nice if they kind

471
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:09,390
of like explained that though. Back to the story
in the present. Detective Mulligan asks Eddie

472
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:14,932
to speak with the serial killer Cletus Kasady
to potentially get more info on his past murders.

473
00:40:15,432 --> 00:40:21,313
Cletus gives Eddie some kind of vague poem for
some reason, and Venom memorizes Cletus's cell

474
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:26,135
drawings and deduces the location of several
missing bodies from the killer's past. Why

475
00:40:26,155 --> 00:40:31,616
do you think Cletus had such a draw to Eddie
Brock? Like, was it just because he was a former

476
00:40:31,676 --> 00:40:36,177
TV personality? I still don't understand why
Cletus saw Eddie Brock as like a family member.

477
00:40:36,758 --> 00:40:41,920
I don't know. He just kind of saw him as a kindred
spirit, I guess. Maybe he had some kind of

478
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:46,982
inclination that there was something darker
lurking within Eddie. Not quite sure. I'm also

479
00:40:47,102 --> 00:40:52,945
not sure what the purpose of Cletus's poem was,
considering that, like, I don't think he knew

480
00:40:53,085 --> 00:40:56,727
where Sheik was being held or that she would
have access to, like, newspapers or something

481
00:40:56,747 --> 00:41:01,449
like that. So- Or that she was even still alive.
Right. So basically it was Cletus just wanting

482
00:41:01,469 --> 00:41:06,236
to play games with Eddie. And then Venom kind
of seeing through that and cutting to the chase

483
00:41:06,456 --> 00:41:11,881
with where the bodies were hidden. That was
a cool scene when Venom was having Eddie draw

484
00:41:12,041 --> 00:41:16,785
out everything that was on the cell walls from
Cletus' cell. I thought that was like a super

485
00:41:16,825 --> 00:41:20,808
cool power. I would love to have like a superpower
like that. I thought it was cool when he put

486
00:41:20,848 --> 00:41:25,432
the Sharpies away and then he started drawing
on the page with his own strands, kind of.

487
00:41:25,932 --> 00:41:30,416
If anything, Eddie Brock can give up his career
as a journalist and just sell drawings all

488
00:41:30,436 --> 00:41:34,887
day since Venom is so artistic and talented.
Apparently revealing the location of these

489
00:41:34,927 --> 00:41:40,372
bodies and getting Cletus sentenced to the death
penalty gave Eddie's career a huge boost But

490
00:41:40,392 --> 00:41:44,955
we never really saw how that manifested right?
It's not like you got a show back or anything

491
00:41:44,995 --> 00:41:48,759
like that, you know, right? Yeah, he wasn't
speaking to his old colleagues back in New

492
00:41:48,779 --> 00:41:52,942
York or something like that, which would have
been cool So Cletus receives the death penalty

493
00:41:53,082 --> 00:41:59,607
and berates Eddie for his actions Venom lashes
out and attacks Cletus in a cell who bites

494
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:04,362
Eddie's hand ingesting part of the symbiote
Eddie meets up with Anne who tells him she's

495
00:42:04,382 --> 00:42:10,584
getting engaged to Dr. Dan Lewis. I'm really
wondering if Venom did reproduce like he did

496
00:42:10,604 --> 00:42:15,285
in the comics at the moment that Cletus bit
Eddie's hand, or if the movie was treating

497
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:20,127
it more like a piece of venom that just kind
of gained its own autonomy. I guess there's

498
00:42:20,167 --> 00:42:24,548
no real difference between that and the way
that symbiotes reproduce since it's asexual,

499
00:42:24,648 --> 00:42:28,449
but I wonder if there was any confusion among
the general public as to why this piece of

500
00:42:28,469 --> 00:42:33,620
venom would turn evil. I mean, I'm still wondering
that, like, why would Carnage, his offspring,

501
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:39,483
want to kill Venom? They never explained that.
I guess for the film, you'd have to claim that

502
00:42:39,663 --> 00:42:46,206
Cletus's own hatred of Eddie kind of manipulated
Carnage into being evil or something. The Carnage

503
00:42:46,246 --> 00:42:51,389
symbiote stops the lethal injection from entering
Cletus's body and transforms him into Carnage.

504
00:42:51,789 --> 00:42:56,072
He escapes, killing all the guards and freeing
the prisoners. I thought this was actually

505
00:42:56,092 --> 00:43:01,947
the best scene in the movie. I liked how Carnage
manifested. during the execution process. I

506
00:43:01,987 --> 00:43:06,549
think that was done better here than in the
comics even. And that escape scene when he's

507
00:43:06,589 --> 00:43:11,472
just like terrorizing the entire cell block,
that was impressive. I was like, holy shit,

508
00:43:11,552 --> 00:43:16,215
it's freaking Carnage. I thought the way he
killed that one security guard with the tongue

509
00:43:16,315 --> 00:43:22,218
choking thing was the most creative and disturbing
kill by Carnage. Like all of those prisoners

510
00:43:22,258 --> 00:43:27,321
that he walked past in that prison should have
all been like massacred. Yeah, I'm not sure

511
00:43:27,341 --> 00:43:32,431
why he freed the prisoners. And really the film
doesn't address the mass prison breakout at

512
00:43:32,511 --> 00:43:36,152
all, you know? But I'm not sure why Carnage
didn't kill them, considering that's probably

513
00:43:36,172 --> 00:43:39,673
what he would have done. They should have at
least addressed what happened with the prisoners.

514
00:43:40,153 --> 00:43:44,494
Eddie and Venom end up having a falling out,
since Eddie doesn't want to eat bad guys, and

515
00:43:44,554 --> 00:43:49,876
Venom leaves Eddie's body. Eddie learns about
Cletus' escape and investigates Cletus' past

516
00:43:50,096 --> 00:43:55,586
at St. Estes. He calls Mulligan to tip him off
to the Shriek connection. Meanwhile, Venom

517
00:43:55,666 --> 00:44:01,388
goes to a rave and appreciates being around
people he calls weirdos. I felt like the whole

518
00:44:01,428 --> 00:44:06,129
rave scene could have just been cut from the
movie. You know, he could have been going around,

519
00:44:06,169 --> 00:44:09,910
traveling around, and then ended up at Mrs.
Chen's place. And the film would have been

520
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:14,251
probably the exact same. If not better, because
we wouldn't have had to have seen Venom look

521
00:44:14,271 --> 00:44:19,513
like a joke with all the glow sticks. Yeah,
save that time for like some more carnage character

522
00:44:19,533 --> 00:44:25,332
development or something. Yeah. Cletus and Carnage
rescue Shriek from Ravencroft, which I thought

523
00:44:25,352 --> 00:44:30,315
was a pretty cool scene too, and the pair destroy
a group of police who come to stop them. Yeah,

524
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:34,799
I did think it was cool that like, Carnage just
appeared in the cell when that like, doctor

525
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:38,842
lady was being a jerk to Shriek. Yeah, and the
fight they had against the cops was pretty

526
00:44:38,882 --> 00:44:42,905
impressive. This was the first time that we
see Shriek use her powers in Carnage's presence,

527
00:44:42,945 --> 00:44:47,168
and he gets like really pissed off at her. And
at that point, everyone's wondering like, why

528
00:44:47,208 --> 00:44:51,482
Carnage would even bother assisting Cletus in
rescuing her. Together, Shriek, Cletus, and

529
00:44:51,502 --> 00:44:56,643
Carnage burn down the old St. Estes home. Eddie
is taken into the police station for questioning

530
00:44:56,743 --> 00:45:01,705
and he calls Anne as his lawyer. He tells her
the situation and she finds venom with Mrs.

531
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:08,827
Chen, which I thought was pretty funny, like
when Mrs. Chen had the venom face. She dons

532
00:45:08,847 --> 00:45:13,768
the symbiote herself and uses it to break Eddie
out of jail and the pair are reunited and make

533
00:45:13,808 --> 00:45:19,699
amends. Detective Mulligan stumbles across Cletus
who kidnaps him. for Shriek who was seeking

534
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:24,883
revenge against the detective for shooting out
her eye all those years ago. In turn, Shriek

535
00:45:24,943 --> 00:45:30,008
kidnaps Anne and Dan calls Eddie to tell him
that she's been taken to a cathedral where

536
00:45:30,048 --> 00:45:34,912
Cletus and Shriek plan to get married. The whole
marriage thing was a little weird. Eddie arrives

537
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:40,017
at the cathedral and Shriek tries to kill Venom
using her powers. Carnage threatens to kill

538
00:45:40,057 --> 00:45:45,441
her if she uses them again. And Venom fights
Carnage while Shriek apparently kills Mulligan.

539
00:45:46,038 --> 00:45:50,782
I liked how during the Carnage-Venom fight they
did establish that Carnage was physically stronger

540
00:45:50,942 --> 00:45:55,846
than Venom considering he was able to tear down
that wall on top of Venom and Venom was unable

541
00:45:55,906 --> 00:46:01,451
to push the wall off of himself. Shriek ends
up claiming that Carnage is going too far and

542
00:46:01,491 --> 00:46:06,295
Carnage tries to kill her and she falls from
the cathedral roof, letting loose a scream

543
00:46:06,355 --> 00:46:10,859
that separates the symbiotes from their hosts
and destroys the cathedral spire.

544
00:46:14,122 --> 00:46:19,526
manages to save Eddie by cushioning his impact.
Cletus was not so fortunate, and Venom devours

545
00:46:19,566 --> 00:46:24,291
the carnage symbiote. Cletus claims he only
wanted to be Eddie's friend before getting

546
00:46:24,331 --> 00:46:29,215
his own head bitten off. Yeah, Venom was like,
fuck this guy. Yeah, I mean, I don't know how

547
00:46:29,235 --> 00:46:34,320
I felt about that. Like, it was funny, but like,
whatever emotional impact the film was going

548
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:39,124
for, with Cletus telling Eddie he just wanted
to be his friend, they totally negated all

549
00:46:39,144 --> 00:46:43,019
of that with the fuck this guy joke. So it seemed
just unnecessary. They shouldn't have tried

550
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:47,921
to humanize Cletus to begin with. I also really
didn't care for the fact that Venom killed

551
00:46:48,061 --> 00:46:53,224
Cletus. Like I think he should have gotten locked
up again, personally. You could always bring

552
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:57,567
Cletus back by saying that remnants of the Carnage
symbiote are still in his bloodstream and that

553
00:46:57,607 --> 00:47:02,609
it gives him a regenerative healing factor,
just like in the comics. Okay, sure. Eddie

554
00:47:02,649 --> 00:47:07,512
says goodbye to Anne and Dan accepting their
relationship, and he and Venom travel to a

555
00:47:07,572 --> 00:47:13,331
tropical location as fugitives from the law.
to start over as the lethal protector. How

556
00:47:13,351 --> 00:47:17,473
were they fugitives from the law though? Because
of the police station escape that they did

557
00:47:17,553 --> 00:47:22,535
earlier. So it's now a matter of public record,
basically, that monsters exist and that Eddie

558
00:47:22,575 --> 00:47:27,077
is one of them. But Eddie wasn't a monster when
they escaped. That was like Ann's fault. I

559
00:47:27,117 --> 00:47:31,740
mean, don't tell that to me, man. Tell that
to the writers of the film. It's a huge plot

560
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:36,590
hole. Like I did not get it. I did not understand
what was going on in the theater. Yeah, I mean,

561
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:41,052
you could totally say that Eddie had deniability,
like he was just kidnapped by this monster

562
00:47:41,092 --> 00:47:44,595
or something. And, you know, they didn't know
it was Anne. Like she, Venom, doesn't look

563
00:47:44,615 --> 00:47:49,878
like Anne, so she has deniability too. There
is the loose thread of Detective Mulligan possibly

564
00:47:49,918 --> 00:47:53,320
being alive that they would have to contend
with, because if he is alive, then he knows

565
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:57,662
everything and Venom really would be a fugitive.
But it's really not clear what's going on with

566
00:47:57,722 --> 00:48:02,465
Detective Mulligan, so. The film ends with Venom
and Eddie in the tropics in the mid-credits

567
00:48:02,485 --> 00:48:08,036
scene. They're watching a telenovela as Venom
hints at his alien races knowledge of the universe.

568
00:48:08,617 --> 00:48:12,699
Suddenly, they're transported to an apparent
alternate dimension or at least a different

569
00:48:12,739 --> 00:48:19,303
location where they see Spider-Man's true identity
as Peter Parker revealed. Venom licks the screen.

570
00:48:19,803 --> 00:48:25,066
I'm not sure if this moment where he changes
dimensions is a result of the Loki television

571
00:48:25,086 --> 00:48:29,749
show or if it's going to be a result of the
Spider-Man No Way Home movie during Doctor

572
00:48:29,769 --> 00:48:34,459
Strange's spell. Perhaps the two events coincide
simultaneously, but we don't know that yet.

573
00:48:34,919 --> 00:48:39,782
Yeah, that would have made like the ending events
of Far From Home and Venom 2 and Loki kind

574
00:48:39,842 --> 00:48:44,404
of all happen at the same time maybe. Right,
yeah, like right around the same time. Did

575
00:48:44,444 --> 00:48:50,166
it seem like Venom was infatuated with Spider-Man?
Well, yeah, clearly. I don't know why. Yeah,

576
00:48:50,246 --> 00:48:56,789
why? I wonder if it'll lead to Venom and Eddie
traveling to meet Spider-Man just so the symbiote

577
00:48:56,809 --> 00:49:00,640
could be passed. Yeah, I'm guessing that Venom
will probably make an appearance in the end

578
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:04,783
credits of No Way Home to transfer the symbiote.
Oh, you think he's going to show up in the

579
00:49:04,863 --> 00:49:09,547
end credits and not the actual movie as one
of the villains of No Way Home? Uh, I don't

580
00:49:09,567 --> 00:49:13,710
think so. I don't know why. A lot of people
are speculating that Venom is going to be one

581
00:49:13,730 --> 00:49:17,613
of the main villains of that film, which I think
would be pretty cool to get Tom Hardy in that

582
00:49:17,653 --> 00:49:22,717
movie, too. But we'll see. If they're planning
on getting the most out of the Venom-Spider-Man

583
00:49:22,757 --> 00:49:27,261
relationship, I think they should definitely
save Venom as an after credits teaser for No

584
00:49:27,281 --> 00:49:32,009
Way Home. That way they can both like, I guess,
team up in a movie down the line. Yeah, I agree.

585
00:49:32,089 --> 00:49:36,413
I don't think you need Venom just yet. You know,
save their relationship for another Spider-Man

586
00:49:36,453 --> 00:49:42,619
film down the line. Or Venom 3. Yeah, exactly.
But that's the whole movie. Overall, I think

587
00:49:42,759 --> 00:49:49,465
that the film was written and directed by actors
who should probably stick to acting. Oh, damn.

588
00:49:49,785 --> 00:49:54,862
Andy Serkis. I love him so much as an actor
from like Gollum and Lord of the Rings. to

589
00:49:54,922 --> 00:50:00,464
Caesar in the Planet of the Apes films, to Ulysses
Klaw in Black Panther. He's so brilliant and

590
00:50:00,504 --> 00:50:05,666
brings so much to his performances, whereas
I felt he brought relatively little to his

591
00:50:05,706 --> 00:50:10,829
direction of this film. I don't think that Tom
Hardy wrote a great script. That is to say

592
00:50:10,869 --> 00:50:15,771
the film is not a complete disaster. I did enjoy
it only at the base level for Tom Hardy and

593
00:50:15,811 --> 00:50:21,273
Brandon's quirky relationship, and some of the
action is entertaining, particularly that carnage

594
00:50:21,313 --> 00:50:26,495
prison escape. But it's full of questionable
things from plot points to acting choices,

595
00:50:26,855 --> 00:50:31,357
and I wish it was a better film. You know, I've
been looking forward to seeing Venom and Carnage

596
00:50:31,538 --> 00:50:36,720
fight in a live action film against each other
ever since I was a kid. And this was not quite

597
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:41,202
the movie that I was hoping for ultimately.
I am interested in seeing where Venom goes

598
00:50:41,242 --> 00:50:45,584
regarding Spider-Man, and I just really hope
that the Venom monster is not such a clown

599
00:50:45,764 --> 00:50:50,990
in his next appearance. I kinda got the feeling
that the filmmakers really, really wanted to

600
00:50:51,130 --> 00:50:55,994
sell the end credits stinger, like if people
so worked up about how cool that was that they

601
00:50:56,074 --> 00:51:02,758
may forget how mediocre the movie itself was
as a whole. I give this film two and a half

602
00:51:02,798 --> 00:51:07,962
stars out of five. That's one whole less star
than we gave the first Venom movie. You saw

603
00:51:08,002 --> 00:51:12,925
this movie before me and you kind of let me
know that you weren't quite happy with it before

604
00:51:13,005 --> 00:51:17,368
even I saw it. I thought that you were being
kind of harsh on it. But after seeing the film,

605
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:22,126
there were so many plot holes. and I felt they
did such a disservice to the character of Carnage

606
00:51:22,526 --> 00:51:26,708
that I have to agree with you. Yeah, I think
it's like right run in the middle of the road.

607
00:51:27,048 --> 00:51:33,109
Not a good film, but not the worst either. 2.5
stars sounds right to me. It was just too disappointing,

608
00:51:33,249 --> 00:51:38,231
I think, to get a better rating than that. My
biggest concern is that once again, these filmmakers

609
00:51:38,291 --> 00:51:43,172
are not taking the character seriously. It's
almost like Sony is going back down the path

610
00:51:43,312 --> 00:51:47,293
as they did with the Amazing Spider-Man franchise,
where they just don't know what the hell they're

611
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:52,373
doing. Hopefully Marvel can save them and Sony
continues their collaborative relationship

612
00:51:52,693 --> 00:51:57,898
with Marvel Studios. Yeah, yeah, the moment
Sony goes rogue and decides to break off ties

613
00:51:57,938 --> 00:52:04,544
with MCU or Kevin Feige or whatever is a dark
day. I do not have high hopes for Sony manning

614
00:52:04,584 --> 00:52:09,408
the reins of the Spider-Man franchise, especially
with a film like this. But that does it for

Halloween themed, but it also ties into Spider-Man

623
00:52:52,097 --> 00:52:58,262
villains. We're going to pit Man-Bat versus
Morbius, the living vampire. Yeah, we were

624
00:52:58,302 --> 00:53:02,625
trying to save this one for, you know, when
the Morbius movie was released, but everything's

625
00:53:02,645 --> 00:53:07,369
been pushed back so far. We need to get this
duel done now in lead up to our upcoming team

626
00:53:07,409 --> 00:53:13,058
duel where we're going to pit the Justice League
Dark against the Midnight Suns. So look forward

627
00:53:13,078 --> 00:53:16,798
to that coming soon down the line. But that
