00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,959
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,142 --> 00:00:28,183
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:28,363 --> 00:00:33,604
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters and stat-based

4
00:00:33,684 --> 00:00:39,966
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother Johnny DC. And in this episode,

5
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:45,687
we're going to find out who'd win in a fight
between the Superman villain, Metallo, and

6
00:00:45,727 --> 00:00:53,749
the Thor slash Iron Man villain, Radioactive
Man. Now they're both characters who emit radiation.

7
00:00:54,506 --> 00:00:59,912
And that is pretty much it. I'm trying to think
of what to add and there really isn't anything

8
00:00:59,952 --> 00:01:07,581
to its radioactivity type match. Of course,
we're doing this in lead up to our team duel

9
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:12,667
that's coming out in a few weeks where we pit
the Legion of Doom. versus the Masters of Evil,

10
00:01:12,827 --> 00:01:17,651
and Radioactive Man has been a prominent member
of the Masters of Evil in many of its incarnations.

11
00:01:17,812 --> 00:01:20,674
Before we get into that fight, we're going to
break down the latest Comic Quick movie news

12
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:24,658
to come out this past week, of which we just
have one news item, and that is the Justice

13
00:01:24,698 --> 00:01:31,004
League Crisis on Infinite Earths Part 2 official
trailer and release date. As always, we list

Thanks a j9k and thanks to everyone who supports
the podcast including Miggy math again whose

30
00:02:57,839 --> 00:03:02,962
birthday was this past week happy birthday,
Miggy happy birthday, man if I could get you

31
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:10,614
a gift from Marvel I would get you an adamantium
skeleton because then you wouldn't break any

32
00:03:10,654 --> 00:03:15,277
bones. And that's just convenient going through
life knowing that that'll never happen. Think

33
00:03:15,317 --> 00:03:19,059
of all like the skateboarding tricks and stuff
you could do. I know you don't skateboard,

34
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:23,481
but you know, like you could take it up. And
I'll take that up a notch. I will give you

35
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:30,685
for your birthday, Captain Adam's metallic skin
shell. It's called Dillistell or silver shield.

36
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:35,668
So you got metal on the outside, metal on the
inside, kind of makes the metal on the inside

37
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:42,204
redundant, but whatever. Happy birthday, man.
Really glad to have you as a patron and an

38
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:46,187
executive producer. Because we want to remind
you to tune into the shows in the Dynamike

39
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:50,831
podcast network this week, including Max Destruction,
which pits your favorite action heroes from

40
00:03:50,891 --> 00:03:55,615
film and television against each other. This
week, host Ken Scottie will find out who'd

41
00:03:55,655 --> 00:03:59,879
win in a fight between Johnny from Surf Ninjas
and Colt from Three Ninjas. We got it wrong

42
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:05,804
last week. Last week's episode was a review
of the movie Dread. On the Sanjo World podcast,

43
00:04:05,884 --> 00:04:11,644
host Zachary Hepburn speculates on fights. between
fan favorite anime characters. This Thursday,

44
00:04:11,865 --> 00:04:17,910
we'll find out who would win in a fight between
Noelle Silva from Black Culver and Juvia Lockser

45
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:23,655
from Fairy Tail. And on the console combat podcast

in the Dynamike Podcast Network. But with that

48
00:04:34,183 --> 00:04:40,506
out of the way, quick to the no prize. A no
prize is an award Marvel used to give out to

49
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:45,969
fans. Our version, the Dynamic Dual No Prize,
is a digital award we post on Instagram for

50
00:04:45,989 --> 00:04:51,071
the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week's question

51
00:04:51,111 --> 00:04:56,554
was, what was your favorite character from the
X-Men 90s cartoon besides Wolverine and why?

52
00:04:56,594 --> 00:05:02,016
And that question is coming off of the trailer
that we got a couple weeks ago for X-Men 97.

53
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:07,467
We got two answers. for this week's no prize
question. So let's go ahead and run down our

54
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:13,770
honorable mention and the no prize winner. Our
first honorable mention goes to DK, who said.

55
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,412
Hey guys, DK here. So one of my favorite characters,
besides Wolverine in the anime series, is going

56
00:05:18,432 --> 00:05:22,633
to be Nightcrawler. He has the awesome power
set of teleportation, but he also has a tragic

57
00:05:22,673 --> 00:05:26,915
backstory that makes you feel for the character.
Unlike other mutants who are able to somewhat

58
00:05:26,955 --> 00:05:32,958
blend in, he comes across as a demon to people
due to his physical appearance. But despite

59
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:37,220
all that, he still tries to help out. And he
still remains one of my favorite characters

60
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:43,284
to this day. Yeah, I don't remember Nightcrawler
appearing too much in the 90s X-Men cartoon.

61
00:05:43,324 --> 00:05:47,026
I think he appeared in a few episodes, but he
was really good in those episodes. He found

62
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:50,708
out that Mystique was his mother and everything.
He was really touching. Nightcrawler has always

63
00:05:50,728 --> 00:05:55,771
been an awesome character. And it would have
been nice if he was a regular on that television

64
00:05:55,811 --> 00:06:01,886
show. Yeah, he was a regular on the X-Men Evolution
series, which was really cool. because Nightcrawler

65
00:06:01,906 --> 00:06:06,350
is just awesome. Great answer, DK. That brings
us to the winner of this week's No Prize, who

66
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:13,156
is Travis Herndon. Who said? Hey guys, Travis
here. So my pick will have to be Bishop. I

67
00:06:13,176 --> 00:06:18,421
think he's a pretty cool character. I love his
powers, his design. I feel like he's a very

68
00:06:18,501 --> 00:06:24,427
underrated X-Man character. Like only like big
Marvel fans will know who he is, as well as

69
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:30,827
him kind of getting overshadowed by other. more
popular black superheroes like Storm, Luke

70
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:37,171
Cage, and Miles Morales. So but yeah, but besides
that, Bishop is my favorite. Bishop also was

71
00:06:37,211 --> 00:06:41,853
not a mainstay of the X-Men 90s cartoon, but
he did appear in more episodes than Nightcrawler,

72
00:06:41,873 --> 00:06:47,256
which is why Travis gets this week's no prize
win. Bishop was part of the quintessential

73
00:06:47,796 --> 00:06:53,479
storyline, Days of Future Past, but The cartoon
adapted it in a really great way, having Bishop

74
00:06:53,499 --> 00:06:57,020
come back in time instead of Kitty Pryde, who
came back in time in the comics. And Bishop's

75
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:01,641
just awesome. I love that character. Totally,
I think, underutilized for how awesome his

76
00:07:01,661 --> 00:07:05,882
power set is of kinetic energy absorption. If
you guys wanna learn more about Nightcrawler

77
00:07:06,122 --> 00:07:11,264
and Bishop, be sure to check out our dual episodes
where we pit Nightcrawler against Creeper and

78
00:07:11,324 --> 00:07:16,405
Bishop against Ourman. Those are some great
episodes. I love those episodes. Definitely

79
00:07:16,445 --> 00:07:20,408
check them out if you haven't already. You're
not allowed to say that because you produce

80
00:07:20,448 --> 00:07:26,534
them. So, yeah, you can't. I'm patting myself
on the back. Good job, Jonathan. But congrats

81
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:30,497
again to Travis Herndon for winning this week's
No Prize. If you the listener want a shot at

82
00:07:30,537 --> 00:07:35,101
winning your own No Prize, stay tuned to later
on in this episode when we will be asking another

83
00:07:35,362 --> 00:07:39,105
question of the week. And now that that's done,
onto the news.

84
00:07:44,462 --> 00:07:50,423
Okay, Justice League Crisis on Infinite Earths
Part 2 is of course the sequel to Crisis on

85
00:07:50,463 --> 00:07:55,605
Infinite Earths Part 1, which we just reviewed
a couple of weeks ago. I really enjoyed that

86
00:07:55,665 --> 00:08:02,507
film. It was kind of hard to follow considering
the non-linear structure of the narrative,

87
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:06,969
but I thought it was kind of brilliant and I've
been really looking forward to Part 2 and this

88
00:08:07,009 --> 00:08:12,783
trailer did not disappoint. No, yeah, I mean,
I thought the first movie was okay. I do think

89
00:08:12,883 --> 00:08:17,885
it set up tremendous potential for the trilogy
of films. And to see the trailer for part two,

90
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:22,687
I was impressed as well. Yeah, it looks like
it's going to be very action packed and continue

91
00:08:22,727 --> 00:08:27,269
the story in an epic fashion. Yeah. And as we
predicted with the conclusion of part one,

92
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:32,851
the way it kind of segue towards Supergirl,
it looks like this trailer will in fact follow

93
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:38,173
her along with Batman and his relationship with
some Robins, I think from some other Earths.

94
00:08:38,774 --> 00:08:44,315
The trailer starts off with Psycho Pirate, however,
interacting with Dr. Strange, who's explaining

95
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:48,476
to Psycho Pirate that he has a role to play
in this upcoming crisis. And I'm really curious

96
00:08:48,496 --> 00:08:54,198
to see how that will compare in the movie to
Psycho Pirate's role in the comics. We'll definitely

97
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:58,579
have to do a Psycho Pirate duel close to when
this film comes out, which is pretty soon.

98
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:04,161
They announced that the release date for this
is going to be April 23rd, so just in a couple

99
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:09,234
months. Of course, like in the Crisis on Infinite
Earths comic, The multiverse gets attacked

100
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:14,897
by shadow demons that are under the control
of the anti-monitor. And we don't see the anti-monitor

101
00:09:15,298 --> 00:09:19,700
in this trailer, but it looks like we do get
to see perhaps the formation of him. It looks

102
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,862
like there's a big reveal that happens that,
you know, we'll have to wait to see in the

103
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:29,626
movie. But there's also some great cameos in
this trailer as well. Not only do we get Batman

104
00:09:29,646 --> 00:09:36,409
Beyond, who we saw in the teaser for part two,
but we also get Commandee from the DC Showcase

105
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:43,916
short. and the Doom Patrol, Blue Beetle, Peacemaker,
just a massive cast of characters that I can't

106
00:09:43,956 --> 00:09:49,159
wait to see. Frickin' metal manor in this, that's
awesome. Yeah, it looks like a huge cast of

107
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:53,861
characters, even bigger than the first film.
It was really nice to see the Dr. Fate cameo

108
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:59,363
present the characters much more capable than
his first appearance in Justice Society World

109
00:09:59,383 --> 00:10:06,150
War II. Oh my gosh, I hated that. He sounded
like Eric Cartman. in that first appearance.

110
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:10,472
He definitely sounds much cooler here and looks
much cooler as he should, because Dr. Faye

111
00:10:10,492 --> 00:10:15,454
is dope. Robin seemed a little whiny, though.
He was like yelling at Batman. He's like, you

112
00:10:15,494 --> 00:10:22,937
made my adolescence suck or something like that.
I was like, OK, you hurt my feelings. No, I

113
00:10:22,977 --> 00:10:30,040
can't tell which Robin that is. It might be
Dick Grayson from Earth to it might be maybe

114
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:35,530
even Jason Todd from another universe. I'm curious
to find out who that is as well. Might be Damien.

115
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:39,872
Might be, you're right. Yeah, that's true. I'm
really curious to find out what's going on

116
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:44,774
with the Bat family because it looks like they're
going to be doing a lot of shadow demon battling

117
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:50,196
here and a lot of battling of their own demons
as a family. Exactly. Couldn't be a metaphor

118
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:56,859
for anything, right? Yeah. Again, the movie
drops late April. It's going to be released

119
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:03,001
digitally and on Blu-ray. So look for it then.
And we'll definitely review it on this podcast.

120
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:07,442
Yeah, and if you haven't seen the first movie
yet, be sure to check that out and listen to

121
00:11:07,562 --> 00:11:12,427
our review on it. But considering the multiversal
nature of the story of Crisis on Infinite Earths,

122
00:11:12,807 --> 00:11:14,729
that brings us to our question of the week.

123
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:25,362
What is your favorite universe in the Marvel
or DC multiverse and why? Yeah, other than,

124
00:11:25,542 --> 00:11:30,385
you know, the primary universe, 616 and Earth
one. Record your answer at dynamic duel dot

Be sure to answer before March 2nd.

130
00:11:58,338 --> 00:12:01,542
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and get into

131
00:12:01,602 --> 00:12:06,829
our main event where we find out who'd win in
a fight between the Superman villain of Metallo

132
00:12:07,329 --> 00:12:10,613
and the Thor slash Iron Man villain, Radioactive
Man.

133
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:30,648
Alright, Metallo versus Radioactive Man. Again,
as we said earlier, this episode will be in

134
00:12:30,688 --> 00:12:36,451
lead up to our team duel episode in a few weeks
where we pit the Legion of Doom versus the

135
00:12:36,511 --> 00:12:41,734
Masters of Evil and Radioactive Man has been
a prominent member of the Masters of Evil.

136
00:12:41,934 --> 00:12:47,677
Yeah, when we were coming up with match ideas
for Radioactive Man, I was thinking Damage

137
00:12:47,737 --> 00:12:52,760
would have been a good opponent for him, but
our executive producers pitched Metallo, I

138
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,743
believe, which I thought was a great choice.
a really popular Superman villain, we haven't

139
00:12:57,783 --> 00:13:03,489
done a duel with him yet, and I like the whole
radioactive aspect between these two characters.

140
00:13:03,809 --> 00:13:09,234
I don't actually know much about Radioactive
Man, but of course everyone knows that Metallo

141
00:13:09,354 --> 00:13:15,840
has a kryptonite heart and uses its radiation
to combat heroes like Superman, Batman, Doom

142
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,665
Patrol, people like that. I imagine he sucks
when he's going up against heroes that aren't

143
00:13:20,765 --> 00:13:25,055
Superman. Like against Superman, he's totally
OP, and then against everyone else, like no

144
00:13:25,075 --> 00:13:29,917
one gives a shit. No, that's not the case at
all. Like he flashes his green rock and they're

145
00:13:29,937 --> 00:13:35,239
like, big whoop, and then they beat the shit
out of him. Yeah, lasers still burn. You know?

146
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,842
Okay, touche, touche. To explain the methodology
behind our duels, let's go to our sentient

147
00:13:40,882 --> 00:13:46,644
duel simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K, tell
our listeners how you go about determining

148
00:13:46,704 --> 00:13:51,874
a winner in our duel matchups. Yes, of course,
sir. The way I determine a winner between the

149
00:13:51,894 --> 00:13:57,936
contestants is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations
using the characters statistics. A Monte Carlo

150
00:13:57,976 --> 00:14:02,257
simulation is a probabilistic model used to
determine outcomes through random sampling.

151
00:14:02,697 --> 00:14:07,598
In this case, I randomise the statistics along
a normal distribution as a way to simulate

152
00:14:07,618 --> 00:14:12,199
the many variables that can occur during battle.
The stat parameters are based on the official

153
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:16,361
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters
statistics are extrapolated.

154
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:24,933
damage potential, versatility and perception
in order to create a more detailed and accurate

155
00:14:24,953 --> 00:14:30,358
simulation. The results of the 1000 simulations
provide a percentage of wins for each character.

156
00:14:30,798 --> 00:14:35,381
The contestant with the higher percentage is
declared the victor as they have a higher probability

157
00:14:35,422 --> 00:14:41,246
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,
neither character should win 100% of the matches.

158
00:14:41,746 --> 00:14:46,230
The comic book stories have shown that there's
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman. So

159
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:50,131
the confidence rate of my method falls in line
with the precedents that have been established

160
00:14:50,171 --> 00:14:55,714
in the source material. My mathematical simulations
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are

161
00:14:55,754 --> 00:15:00,156
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes
tabulated for determination of the winner.

162
00:15:01,576 --> 00:15:06,538
Thanks, J9K! Before we run the simulations though,
we like to break down each character's histories

163
00:15:06,558 --> 00:15:11,941
and abilities before improvising a scenario
on how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations

164
00:15:11,981 --> 00:15:17,344
would play out beat for beat. And I believe
it's my turn to go first this episode with

165
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:21,868
the Marvel character. So let me go ahead and
tell you all about Radioactive Man. And it's

166
00:15:21,908 --> 00:15:27,333
not the Simpsons version, by the way. Marvel
always ripping everything off. Excuse you.

167
00:15:27,693 --> 00:15:31,877
Obviously, this version of Radioactive Man came
out before the Simpsons version. So I agree

168
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:37,021
to disagree. And also like Marvel and the Simpsons
have the same parent company, Disney now. So

169
00:15:37,461 --> 00:15:43,246
it's all moot. They got to sue themselves or
something. All right, Chen Lu. was born in

170
00:15:43,306 --> 00:15:48,610
Lanshao, China, where he grew up to become a
nuclear physicist and the country's foremost

171
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:54,835
authority in nuclear radiation. When China once
attempted to use its military to invade India,

172
00:15:55,216 --> 00:16:00,620
the hero Thor stopped them, prompting the Chinese
government to develop a means to stop Thor

173
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:06,111
and other Western heroes like him. They consulted
with military strategists and scientists for

174
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:11,653
a solution, and it was Chen Lu who suggested
using nuclear radiation to induce superpowers

175
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:16,675
in human beings. He was so sure of his concept,
having been experimenting with radioactive

176
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:22,338
effects for years that he offered himself as
the first test subject. With the Chinese government's

177
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:28,240
approval, Chen Lu exposed himself to massive
doses of particle radiation, transforming him

178
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:33,932
into the green glowing radioactive man. Impressing
his government with his newfound powers, they

179
00:16:34,012 --> 00:16:39,476
smuggled Chen Lu into New York, where he attacked
Thor. During the battle, Thor learned that

180
00:16:39,496 --> 00:16:44,361
a sufficient physical attack against Chen Lu
would cause him to erupt like an H-bomb in

181
00:16:44,401 --> 00:16:49,145
the middle of the city. To save New York, the
hero used his hammer Mjolnir to summon a wind

182
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:55,410
vortex so powerful that it sucked up and carried
Chen Lu back to an area of unpopulated China

183
00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:00,690
where the villain reached critical mass and
exploded, seemingly dead. You can learn more

184
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:05,292
about Thor in our duel episode where we pit
him against Wonder Woman. Later, however, it

185
00:17:05,332 --> 00:17:10,014
was revealed that Chen Liu survived and went
into hiding due to his failure to defeat Thor.

186
00:17:10,414 --> 00:17:15,736
He was found and contacted by the villain Baron
Zemo, who recruited Chen Liu into a supervillain

187
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:21,299
team called the Masters of Evil. The Masters
of Evil attacked the Avengers, but were defeated,

188
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:27,061
Chen Liu specifically, by Iron Man, who became
his new signature foe. When the robot villain

189
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:32,563
Ultron formed a second iteration of the Masters
of Evil, he also recruited Chen Lu, but the

190
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:38,204
supervillain team again failed. Chen Lu broke
out of prison and retreated to live in Vietnam,

191
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:43,886
where he and the Iron Man adversaries Crimson
Dynamo and Titanium Man formed their own group

192
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:49,648
called the Titanic Three, champions of Eastern
communism and defenders of the people. However,

193
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:54,809
the pool of revenge was too strong, and Chen
Lu was recruited into a third iteration of

194
00:17:54,829 --> 00:18:00,079
the Masters of Evil. this time led by the Ant-Man
villain, Egghead. Though they attempted to

195
00:18:00,159 --> 00:18:05,102
humiliate and disgrace Ant-Man, he ultimately
foiled their plans and the team disbanded.

196
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:10,264
Chen Liu was deported back to China, where he
became an agent of the Mandarin, a Chinese

197
00:18:10,324 --> 00:18:15,066
villain warlord that you can learn more about
in his duel against Abracadabra. As a henchman

198
00:18:15,086 --> 00:18:20,068
for the Ten Rings, he went toe-to-toe with Iron
Man, who took him to the Vault, a nuclear-powered

199
00:18:20,148 --> 00:18:25,682
prison that at the time was undergoing a meltdown.
Iron Man convinced Chen Liu to absorb the excess

200
00:18:25,702 --> 00:18:31,344
radiation, which saved the prisoners and guards.
He later became a henchman for Tiberius Stone,

201
00:18:31,584 --> 00:18:36,466
a rival of Tony Stark's, who sought to discredit
Stark International, the Hero's Corporation.

202
00:18:36,926 --> 00:18:42,088
You can learn more about Iron Man in his duel
against Cyborg. After a string of failures,

203
00:18:42,308 --> 00:18:46,949
Chen Liu began experiencing fluctuations in
his energy levels, realizing that his powers

204
00:18:46,969 --> 00:18:51,751
were tied to his well-being. He determined he
had spent so much of his time working for others,

205
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:56,212
be it the Chinese government, the Masters of
Evil, the Mandarin, or other bureaucrats and

206
00:18:56,252 --> 00:19:01,714
megalomaniacs, people he secretly felt superior
to, when he should just be working toward his

207
00:19:01,854 --> 00:19:07,236
own interests. To that end, he became a hero
for the Chinese people, vowing to do a good

208
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:12,077
deed for every person he had ever killed or
harmed, directly or indirectly, through his

209
00:19:12,117 --> 00:19:17,541
powers. One of his heroic actions was to defend
China from an attack by a group of Atlantean

210
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:22,686
criminals called the Fathoms Five, where he
was assisted by the latest incarnation of the

211
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:28,290
Thunderbolts, which was a team of villains turned
heroes. Chen Lu joined the Thunderbolts ranks

212
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:33,675
and secretly irradiated one of the Fathom Five
members so that when they returned to Atlantis

213
00:19:33,695 --> 00:19:39,114
to stand trial, the whole group would all die
from radiation. On loan from China, Chen Liu

214
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:43,276
traveled with the Thunderbolts back to New York
where they helped repel an attack by the villainous

215
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:48,378
organization Hydra, and then went after heroes
who refused to register with the government's

216
00:19:48,518 --> 00:19:53,300
Superhuman Registration Act. He was dismayed
to learn that the Chinese government wanted

217
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:57,942
him to stay with the Thunderbolts in America
to keep him away from China due to the danger

218
00:19:58,002 --> 00:20:03,825
he posed. However, Chen Liu was later forced
to return to his home country when Norman Osborn

219
00:20:03,845 --> 00:20:08,011
took control of the Thunderbolts. and didn't
want him interfering with his plans to use

220
00:20:08,051 --> 00:20:12,575
the team for his own personal agenda. You can
learn more about Norman Osborn in our Joker

221
00:20:12,615 --> 00:20:18,360
vs Green Goblin duel episode. Working with China's
People's Defense Force, Chen Lu helped stop

222
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,724
an attack from new Inhumans who were granted
power by the Terrigin Mists released into Earth's

223
00:20:23,845 --> 00:20:28,588
atmosphere by the Inhuman King Black Bolt, whom
you can learn more about in his duel against

224
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:34,033
Shazam. Eventually, Chen Lu was asked to join
a new incarnation of the Thunderbolts team

225
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:40,407
in New York. an invite that he accepted. And
that's his backstory. Powers-wise, radioactive

226
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:45,713
man can manipulate radioactive energies for
a variety of effects, including but not limited

227
00:20:45,753 --> 00:20:52,761
to radioactive energy blasts that can incinerate
a city block, intense light generation capable

228
00:20:52,821 --> 00:20:58,855
of causing temporary blindness, and radiation
absorption. This allows him to absorb energy

229
00:20:58,895 --> 00:21:03,777
attacks directed against him and temporarily
depower opponents whose abilities are granted

230
00:21:03,837 --> 00:21:08,780
by radiation, such as the Hulk or Spider-Man,
by absorbing that radiation from them. His

231
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:14,544
radiation can also temporarily enhance his natural
physiology, granting him 9 vulnerability and

232
00:21:14,604 --> 00:21:20,167
increased strength able to lift around 2 tons.
He can manifest radioactive energy constructs

233
00:21:20,187 --> 00:21:25,898
such as force fields, tendrils, or even energy
copies of himself. He can also generate low

234
00:21:25,938 --> 00:21:31,243
level radiation to cause sickness and radiation
poisoning within an enemy, and can also emit

235
00:21:31,283 --> 00:21:36,627
an electromagnetic pulse. Finally, Radioactive
Man is a world scientific authority in the

236
00:21:36,647 --> 00:21:42,792
field of nuclear physics and radioactivity.
Yeah, too bad, kryptonite is an alien xenomineral

237
00:21:42,832 --> 00:21:46,895
that he's not going to be able to absorb the
radiation for. I'm sure he can give it his

238
00:21:46,935 --> 00:21:54,361
best shot. And fail. Sounds good to me. Let
me get into his opponent, Mattello's backstory.

239
00:21:54,850 --> 00:22:00,334
Now John Corbin was a con man who was fatally
wounded in a car crash as he was fleeing a

240
00:22:00,374 --> 00:22:07,541
crime. His body was recovered by Professor Emmett
Vale, a specialist in cybernetics who had previously

241
00:22:07,661 --> 00:22:13,706
intercepted and misinterpreted a message from
Jor-El to his son Superman, and believed that

242
00:22:13,886 --> 00:22:20,592
Superman was a scout in an impending alien invasion.
You can learn more about Superman in our Superman

243
00:22:20,632 --> 00:22:26,981
vs. Dr. Doom episode. Professor Vale transferred
Corbin's brain into a robotic body made from

244
00:22:27,021 --> 00:22:33,427
an indestructible alloy known as metallo and
powered by a two-pound chunk of kryptonite,

245
00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:39,392
a radioactive remnant of Superman's birth planet
that weakens him. Enraged by what had been

246
00:22:39,452 --> 00:22:44,556
done to him, Corbin killed the Professor once
he had completed covering the metal chassis

247
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:51,450
with a foam latex sheath that resembled human
skin, allowing Corbin to pass as human. Built

248
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:57,535
with no purpose other than to kill Superman,
Corbin adhered to his creator's wishes and

249
00:22:57,615 --> 00:23:03,240
fought the Man of Steel as the villain, Metello,
named after the metal that composed his body.

250
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:09,225
Metello nearly killed Superman until Lex Luthor
intervened as he had realized the value in

251
00:23:09,285 --> 00:23:15,270
Corbin's kryptonite heart and took it for himself,
shutting Corbin's body down for a time. You

252
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:20,295
can learn more about Lex Luthor in his dual
episode against Baron Zemo. Placed in a storage

253
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:25,942
vault within LexCorp, Mattello's backup power
system kicked in and he escaped, later returning

254
00:23:25,982 --> 00:23:31,609
to LexCorp to raid Lex's growing stash of kryptonite
and to steal parts for cybernetic upgrades

255
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:37,697
to his body. While seeking more cybernetic parts,
Mattello found some intended for Robotman.

256
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:43,255
a member of the Doom Patrol, who you can learn
more about in our Robotman vs. Thing episode.

257
00:23:43,675 --> 00:23:49,140
After getting into a fight with the Doom Patrol,
Metallo's body was destroyed, leaving only

258
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,767
his head surviving intact, which Loser collected
and stored inside of a crate. Eventually, Metallo

259
00:23:55,787 --> 00:24:00,671
was brought back to life and his head placed
on a new robotic body when Brainiac secretly

260
00:24:00,711 --> 00:24:07,256
invaded LuxCorp's computer network. Metallo
agreed to work with Brainiac, who created robotic

261
00:24:07,316 --> 00:24:13,280
duplicates of Metallo to distract Superman while
Metallo led a robot invasion of LuxCorp and

262
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:20,165
Cadmus Labs. Using stolen cybernetic and cloning
technology, Metallo was able to help Brainiac

263
00:24:20,245 --> 00:24:25,929
build himself a new body. You can learn more
about Brainiac in our Brainiac vs Ultron episode.

264
00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:31,213
Metallo was destroyed by Superman, however,
and his head was quarantined on Strikers Island

265
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:38,423
After being rebuilt and destroyed several more
times, Metallo sold his soul to the demon Neuron,

266
00:24:38,743 --> 00:24:44,865
who in exchange gave Metallo the ability to
technomorph his body like a transformer and

267
00:24:44,905 --> 00:24:50,447
incorporate nearby metal and machinery into
his frame. Metallo was eventually defeated

268
00:24:50,527 --> 00:24:56,348
by the hero Steel, who tricked Metallo into
absorbing a bomb into himself. You can learn

269
00:24:56,368 --> 00:25:02,943
more about Steel in his duel against War Machine.
During Gwaidu-K, Brainiac 13 created a new

270
00:25:02,983 --> 00:25:08,607
body for Metallo, though Superman received help
from the Metal Man, Led, to remove Metallo's

271
00:25:08,647 --> 00:25:14,291
kryptonite heart once again. You can learn more
about Led in our Metal Man vs. Colossus episode.

272
00:25:14,691 --> 00:25:19,555
When Lex Luthor was elected President of the
United States, he had Metallo transform into

273
00:25:19,595 --> 00:25:25,579
a colossal spaceship to take on General Zod,
who had transformed Earth's sun into a red

274
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:31,259
star. For his efforts in helping save the world,
President Luthor pardoned Metello for his past

275
00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:36,704
crimes, and Metello was set free. When Batman
and Superman went on a mission to remove all

276
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:42,148
Kryptonite from Earth, Batman replaced Metello's
heart with an electric battery in exchange

277
00:25:42,168 --> 00:25:48,228
for Metello's Kryptonite. When Superboy Prime
and Alexander Luther Jr. from Earth-3 attempted

278
00:25:48,268 --> 00:25:54,751
to restore DC's multiverse, reality was warped
and Metello's origin was revised so that John

279
00:25:54,791 --> 00:26:00,974
Corbin was a sergeant in the US Army under the
command of General Sam Lane, the father of

280
00:26:01,054 --> 00:26:06,596
Lois Lane, whom the General was hoping would
one day marry Sergeant Corbin. At the behest

281
00:26:06,636 --> 00:26:14,880
of the General, Corbin volunteered to don experimental
Exosu armor powered by Zero, that was developed

282
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:21,063
by LuxCorp to combat Superman, who the General
saw as an extraterrestrial threat to humanity.

283
00:26:21,464 --> 00:26:26,987
The Kryptonite proved to be an unstable power
source, however, and after an energy surge

284
00:26:27,007 --> 00:26:32,710
within the suit nearly killed Corbin, Lex Luthor
was forced to fuse Corbin to the suit, turning

285
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:39,533
him into a Kryptonite-powered cyborg. In post-Flashpoint
continuity, Corbin's new origin largely remained

286
00:26:39,613 --> 00:26:44,669
the same. though his childhood was revealed
to be traumatic, as he was forced to shoot

287
00:26:44,709 --> 00:26:50,355
and kill his father to protect his sister Tracy.
After enlisting in the army at a young age,

288
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:56,180
Corbin volunteered to don an experimental suit
once again, though this time it was designed

289
00:26:56,220 --> 00:27:01,445
by Lux Corp weapons engineer John Henry Irons,
who would later be known as the hero Steel.

290
00:27:01,878 --> 00:27:08,060
The suit, however, was taken over by Brainiac,
causing Corbin's heart to burst. Powered by

291
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:13,162
Kryptonite and controlled by Brainiac, Irons
was able to defeat this new version of Metallo

292
00:27:13,463 --> 00:27:19,505
by building his own power suit and uploading
a virus into Metallo to stop both him and Brainiac.

293
00:27:19,825 --> 00:27:25,088
Metallo helped Superman defeat Brainiac, though
was injured in the process and placed into

294
00:27:25,128 --> 00:27:30,546
a coma. To save his life, Corbin was once again
fused with the suit, and given a kryptonite

295
00:27:30,586 --> 00:27:37,770
heart to survive. Proving to be mentally unstable
once he awoke, Corbin's organic body was eventually

296
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:43,593
destroyed in an attempt to blow up Superman,
though Brainiac uploaded a memory engram of

297
00:27:43,633 --> 00:27:49,616
Corbin's mind into the Metello suit to keep
him functional. After Brainiac's defeat, it

298
00:27:49,636 --> 00:27:54,991
was later revealed that Corbin's brain had survived.
and that upon learning that Lex Luthor had

299
00:27:55,091 --> 00:28:01,456
framed his sister Tracy for murder, Horbin agreed
to be placed in a new humanoid synthetic body,

300
00:28:01,876 --> 00:28:08,601
also powered by kryptonite, to do Lex Luthor's
bidding. And that's Mattello's backstory. Powers-wise,

301
00:28:08,801 --> 00:28:14,685
Mattello's nigh-indestructible metal frame grants
him super strength, and his cybernetic augmentation

302
00:28:15,074 --> 00:28:20,816
grants him enhanced senses and processing speed,
allowing him to react, strategize, and analyze

303
00:28:20,856 --> 00:28:25,839
probability faster than humanly possible. Upgrades
to his body have allowed him to transform his

304
00:28:25,939 --> 00:28:32,662
limbs into bladed, club, and projectile weapons
such as chainsaws, hammers, guns, and cannons.

305
00:28:33,082 --> 00:28:38,144
The latter, which can shoot bullet shards of
his kryptonite hearts or beams of radiation.

306
00:28:38,544 --> 00:28:45,488
This energy can also be projected from his eyes
or from his chest when he opens panels for

307
00:28:45,568 --> 00:28:51,650
maximum exposure to its radiation. And that's
Metallo. Metallo's always been a cool Superman

308
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:54,891
villain. He's probably one of my favorites.
I'm really glad that we're finally getting

309
00:28:54,931 --> 00:28:58,852
to do a duel with him because he just has a
cool look to him. But it also seems like he

310
00:28:58,872 --> 00:29:02,634
has a pretty interesting backstory. I mean,
there are three different versions of the backstory,

311
00:29:02,654 --> 00:29:06,895
but that's DC for you. There's also like three
different versions of Metallo that I didn't

312
00:29:06,915 --> 00:29:11,977
even go into a few of the others. Like one of
them was John Corbin's brother for a time who

313
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:16,788
kind of took up his mantle. It was dumb and
short lived. And there's even a metallo that

314
00:29:16,848 --> 00:29:20,792
predates him. That's, you know, a little bit
different, but it's only spelled with one L.

315
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:26,837
So I do agree that the look of my tallow is
pretty cool. It's kind of like a T 800 Terminator,

316
00:29:27,378 --> 00:29:31,902
but with green glowing guys instead of red.
Yeah, I think that's why his look appeals to

317
00:29:31,922 --> 00:29:35,745
me, just because that pop culture appeal with
Terminator. Right. Yeah.

318
00:29:42,922 --> 00:29:47,183
Now that we've got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

319
00:29:47,283 --> 00:29:53,244
of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not the speculation,

320
00:29:53,664 --> 00:29:59,586
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could
play out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?

321
00:30:00,446 --> 00:30:04,447
Well, I should say there are no rules, other
than the characters have no prior knowledge

322
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:08,868
of the other going into the fight. All they
are aware of starting out is that the other

323
00:30:08,888 --> 00:30:13,718
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.
For the speculation... The contestants will

324
00:30:13,738 --> 00:30:19,083
begin approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript
environment that will have no bearing on the

325
00:30:19,103 --> 00:30:24,467
match itself, as no environmental statistics
are considered in my simulations. The contestants

326
00:30:24,507 --> 00:30:30,072
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright
then let's get into it. Metallo and Radioactive

327
00:30:30,132 --> 00:30:35,617
Man meet on the battlefield. Who goes first?
I think Metallo would actually go first in

328
00:30:35,637 --> 00:30:41,101
this one because he's more of a soldier, right?
Whereas like Radioactive Man's more of a scientist.

329
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:47,473
No, I agree. Metallo will go first, and he's
going to start off with a ranged attack. He's

330
00:30:47,493 --> 00:30:52,876
going to transform his hand into like an energy
blaster and blast Radioactive Man with a laser

331
00:30:52,896 --> 00:30:57,999
beam of kryptonite radiation. That's not going
to do anything because Radioactive Man is going

332
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:02,281
to throw up a force field and this energy force
field just deflects the kryptonite radiation

333
00:31:02,941 --> 00:31:08,585
and Radioactive Man is going to walk toward
Metallo with his hand outstretched and he's

334
00:31:08,625 --> 00:31:14,955
going to emit like a low level... wave of radiation
that sweeps through and poisons the organic

335
00:31:15,015 --> 00:31:20,736
portions of Matalo's body just causing them
to decay and burn away. Dude, the only remaining

336
00:31:20,816 --> 00:31:27,418
human parts of Matalo is his brain and that
thing's heavily protected and shielded in lead

337
00:31:27,698 --> 00:31:33,600
so your attack like literally does nothing but
make Matalo look cooler now that Radioactive

338
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:40,802
Man has singed off his synthetic skin. He's
basically Terminator now. And now Attalo is

339
00:31:40,822 --> 00:31:45,764
going to respond by leaping towards Radioactive
Man, and he's going to transform his arm into

340
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:51,587
a chainsaw, and he's going to straight up massacre
Radioactive Man. Except Radioactive Man has

341
00:31:51,627 --> 00:31:57,729
enhanced durability. Like he's bulletproof.
He's highly durable. That makes no sense. Like

342
00:31:57,829 --> 00:32:03,052
why? Well, for the same reason he has enhanced
strength. It's like not only can he emit radiation,

343
00:32:03,232 --> 00:32:07,353
the radiation also powers him like it would
the Hulk, although not nearly to that extent.

344
00:32:08,154 --> 00:32:12,856
I guess the Hulk is a precedent. That's yeah,
you did chainsaws not gonna hurt radioactive

345
00:32:12,896 --> 00:32:17,758
man for one but I don't even think that Mattel
is chainsaws gonna even reach radioactive man

346
00:32:18,018 --> 00:32:22,920
because Radioactive man is gonna generate an
energy construct of this like tendril That's

347
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:28,502
just gonna slap Mattel Oh out of the air and
send him crashing to the ground at which point

348
00:32:29,063 --> 00:32:34,985
Radioactive man is gonna superheat the floor
beneath Mattel Oh into this like green glowing

349
00:32:35,105 --> 00:32:40,872
goo and Metallo is just gonna slowly sink into
it until he's fully submerged, except for like

350
00:32:40,912 --> 00:32:47,576
his hand, and he just gives a thumbs up as he
slowly sinks into the radioactive pool. That's

351
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:55,100
great. I always just wanna leave it there. But
no, Metallo's not out. A few moments later,

352
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,883
the ground's gonna be rumbling beneath Radioactive
Man as Metallo drills his way out of the ground

353
00:33:01,484 --> 00:33:06,394
into Radioactive Man, who he was able to track
underground. due to radioactive man's heat

354
00:33:06,434 --> 00:33:12,456
signature. Okay, so, Matalo bursts from the
ground and drills into radioactive man, or

355
00:33:12,516 --> 00:33:18,478
rather who he thought was radioactive man, because
it was really just a radioactive duplicate.

356
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:26,520
Duh. And as Matalo drills into this radioactive
copy, it's gonna explode in a flash of light

357
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:32,674
that just blinds Matalo, leaving him open for
attack. He has no eyes, or like... You know,

358
00:33:32,694 --> 00:33:37,438
none that will be affected like human eyes since
he can see on multiple wavelengths. That's

359
00:33:37,618 --> 00:33:44,044
right. What I meant to say is that the radioactive
duplicate exploded like a small nuclear bomb

360
00:33:44,164 --> 00:33:50,610
and just vaporized Metello. But the Metello
alloy is durable enough to withstand a nuclear

361
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:55,554
blast. So Metello is just walking through the
fallout like a badass, just scanning for the

362
00:33:55,594 --> 00:34:01,326
real radioactive man. OK. And when he spots
him, uh... his systems are just going to shut

363
00:34:01,366 --> 00:34:09,670
down because Radioactive Man at that point unleashes
an EMP blast that renders Mattello inert. So

364
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:16,112
he's done match over. I know. I mean, because
Mattello still has his kryptonite power source.

365
00:34:16,592 --> 00:34:21,554
So, you know, that'll just trigger his backup
systems that get him back up and running in

366
00:34:21,594 --> 00:34:28,097
like no time. And at that point, Mattello is
going to catch Radioactive Man off guard because

367
00:34:28,117 --> 00:34:33,201
he thought he was. you know, shut down and he's
going to fire this massive blast from his open

368
00:34:33,241 --> 00:34:40,286
chest panel along with beams from his energy
cannon arms and eye blasts just overloading

369
00:34:40,426 --> 00:34:45,249
radioactive man with kryptonite radiation and
that's going to cause him to self detonate,

370
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:51,293
just explode and die. No no, radioactive man
does not overload, okay? There's no limit to

371
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:56,857
the amount of energy that he can absorb. There
is with kryptonite radiation! Oh really? Why?

372
00:34:57,998 --> 00:35:03,180
Because like, it's an exotic form of radiation
that's probably not even on the electromagnetic

373
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:10,183
spectrum. Why? Well, because I said! You're
just making shit up now. I say Radioactive

374
00:35:10,223 --> 00:35:16,246
Man absorbs Metallo's energy attack, and not
only that, but Radioactive Man also absorbs

375
00:35:16,586 --> 00:35:22,148
all of the energy from Metallo's kryptonite
heart, which is going to depower him, and that's

376
00:35:22,188 --> 00:35:28,287
how Radioactive Man wins. But we can leave it
there. So in one scenario, radioactive man

377
00:35:28,468 --> 00:35:33,671
absorbs the radiation from metallo's kryptonite
heart, depowering him. And in the other scenario,

378
00:35:34,212 --> 00:35:39,896
metallo overloads radioactive man with kryptonite
energy, causing him to explode. We'll go ahead

379
00:35:39,916 --> 00:35:44,759
and input the stats and run the simulations
on this matchup and come back with a winner.

380
00:35:44,959 --> 00:35:53,345
AG9K, hit it! Inputting data, running calculations,
processing results, simulations complete. So

381
00:35:53,405 --> 00:35:57,207
this was a... Really interesting matchup. I
know that when we went into it, we weren't

382
00:35:57,227 --> 00:36:01,910
entirely sure if this was gonna be even or not
because I didn't know much about Matalo. You

383
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:06,532
didn't know much about Radioactive Man, but
in inputting the stats, it was really interesting

384
00:36:06,572 --> 00:36:12,816
to see how the characters went back and forth
because like, Matalo is faster, but Radioactive

385
00:36:12,836 --> 00:36:17,899
Man is more evasive because of his force field
shielding. We said that they're about equally

386
00:36:17,979 --> 00:36:24,162
durable and they're actually very durable, but
we said that Matalo is sh- stronger ultimately

387
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:30,225
because this guy could hurl buses and Radioactive
Man for some reason can only lift two tons.

388
00:36:30,585 --> 00:36:35,667
Yeah, you think he'd be stronger than that,
but he's not. However, Radioactive Man's damage

389
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:40,989
level is almost off the charts because he's
like a nuclear bomb. Yeah, Mattello's not quite

390
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:46,392
at that level, but he is a better fighter than
Radioactive Man because he has military training.

391
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:52,315
We said they have similar range, but Radioactive
Man is smarter. because he's a scientist, although

392
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:58,341
Mattello has greater perception due to his robotic
brain. Surprisingly, they were pretty evenly

393
00:36:58,401 --> 00:37:02,765
matched when it came to versatility. I thought
Mattello was going to have the edge here because

394
00:37:02,805 --> 00:37:07,089
for a lot of iterations, he's kind of like a
transformer, or at least parts of him are.

395
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:12,535
But really when it came down to it, he's only
working with one form of radiation, whereas

396
00:37:12,915 --> 00:37:17,667
Radioactive Man is kind of working with all
of them. For the most part, their stats were

397
00:37:17,727 --> 00:37:22,530
very much like back and forth. And these guys
did differ stat wise more than I thought they

398
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:27,093
would. Yeah, the stats weren't similar, but
they're still pretty even. Considering that,

399
00:37:27,133 --> 00:37:32,097
Jonathan, who do you think is actually going
to win this? That's a great question. I'm hoping

400
00:37:32,137 --> 00:37:36,960
Mattello is going to take the win. And it's
kind of hard to say who our Instagram followers

401
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,604
think is going to win, considering I put up
the poll just like an hour ago before this

402
00:37:41,644 --> 00:37:51,972
recording. But right now it looks like Radioactive
Man is in the lead at 53%. So that sucks. Makes

403
00:37:52,012 --> 00:37:57,113
sense to me, though. No, it makes zero sense
to me. Mattel is way more popular than Radioactive

404
00:37:57,133 --> 00:38:03,835
Man. Why is that? Because he's in the freaking
cartoons and like Smallville and like all the

405
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:09,577
Superman stuff. Mattel is a really popular Superman
villain. Who the hell is Radioactive Man? I

406
00:38:09,597 --> 00:38:13,523
would say before listening to this episode.
Well, I mean, Radioactive Man's been in the

407
00:38:13,563 --> 00:38:19,247
cartoons, too. He was in Avengers Earth's Mightiest
Heroes cartoon and Avengers Assemble. Yeah,

408
00:38:19,347 --> 00:38:25,951
no one watches those cartoons just because you
didn't. Yeah. Like if it didn't happen in the

409
00:38:25,991 --> 00:38:32,576
90s, it doesn't count. All right, let's go out
and get the winner for this match. AJ 9K, the

410
00:38:32,616 --> 00:38:41,414
results, please. Hey, you are, sir. All right.
The winner of the matchup between Matalo. and

411
00:38:41,474 --> 00:38:52,097
Radioactive Man is... Metallo. YES! And it was
really close. Out of the 1000 simulated matches,

412
00:38:52,517 --> 00:39:03,160
Metallo won 514 matches, whereas Radioactive
Man won 486, so it was 51.4% over 48.6%. Holy

413
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:09,239
crap! That is way closer than I thought it was
going to be. Yeah, really no character had

414
00:39:09,459 --> 00:39:14,441
a massive advantage over the other. They both
just had so much going for them. And basically,

415
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:19,003
Metallo got lucky is what I'm thinking. It almost
kind of looks that way. I guess when it comes

416
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:24,985
down to perception and fighting and speed, it
really helped push Metallo over the edge. Yeah.

417
00:39:25,025 --> 00:39:30,708
So however these guys fight, it seems like a
majority of the wins for Metallo happened due

418
00:39:30,748 --> 00:39:35,346
to like hand to hand stuff, which makes sense
because really they can't. hurt each other

419
00:39:35,366 --> 00:39:41,490
too much with their energy attacks. Yeah, no,
Metellus is just too protected against radiation

420
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:47,494
and radioactive man is too good at absorbing
radiation. Though apparently not kryptonite

421
00:39:47,534 --> 00:39:54,479
radiation as we've learned. Okay. Now I think
a majority of these wins happen due to physical

422
00:39:54,519 --> 00:40:00,844
combat. I guess that makes sense. So I'm not
happy about it, but damn, do I respect the

423
00:40:00,864 --> 00:40:05,774
math. Hell yeah. That does it for this duel,

00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:51,391
Our next episode is going to be a review. We're
going to discuss the 2003 Ang Lee movie, Hulk,

432
00:40:51,791 --> 00:40:57,514
which I love and I cannot wait to talk about.
The film gets way too much hate. The reason

433
00:40:57,554 --> 00:41:03,258
we're reviewing that film is because Absorbing
Man is the primary villain of that movie and

434
00:41:03,278 --> 00:41:08,181
he's also going to be on the Masters of Evil
roster for the team duel in the subsequent

435
00:41:08,221 --> 00:41:13,805
episode. And also, you know, like Hulk deals
with gamma radiation and both characters in

436
00:41:13,825 --> 00:41:18,068
this episode dealt with radiation, so it just
fits. Now I think is the time to review this

437
00:41:18,088 --> 00:41:22,659
film. So look forward to that! But that does
it for this episode, we want to give a big

438
00:41:22,699 --> 00:41:27,642
