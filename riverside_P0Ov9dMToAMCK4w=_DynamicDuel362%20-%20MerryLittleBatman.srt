December duel episode. Which fanbase will be

16
00:01:34,704 --> 00:01:40,327

ahead since last week. Who's the slackers now?

17
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:45,769
Marvel guys, it's you. Keep up the good work,
Team DC. On with the show.

18
00:02:06,262 --> 00:02:11,785
Hi, welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

19
00:02:11,805 --> 00:02:17,349
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters and stat-based battle simulations.

20
00:02:17,809 --> 00:02:23,453
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous
Joe. And in this episode, we are doing a review

21
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:30,078
of the Amazon Prime animated feature film, Merry
Little Batman. I actually got the opportunity

22
00:02:30,138 --> 00:02:35,982
to see this film in the movie theater with my
family, and I loved the heck out of it. Yeah,

23
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:40,826
I mean, it's probably one of the better like
holiday releases that Marvel and DC have ever

24
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:46,370
produced, right? I mean, there's not many, so
it's not hard to do. But yeah, this is the

25
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:51,535
best of anything holiday related that Marvel
or DC has put out. We're going to talk all

26
00:02:51,555 --> 00:02:55,078
about the movie later on in this episode. But
before that, we're going to break down the

27
00:02:55,098 --> 00:03:00,042
comic book movie news items from the past week.
There's not many news items. We did learn,

28
00:03:00,062 --> 00:03:05,754
however, that Sean Gunn has been cast as Maxwell
Lord in the DC universe. and we got a couple

29
00:03:05,814 --> 00:03:10,755
of video game trailers, one for Suicide Squad
Killed the Justice League, and the other is

30
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:16,117
a teaser trailer for a new Blade video game.
As always, we list our segment times in our

31
00:03:16,157 --> 00:03:19,938
episode description, so feel free to check out
the show notes if you want to skip ahead to

32
00:03:19,978 --> 00:03:24,619
a particular topic. As our listeners may know,
our duel simulator is so advanced that it's

33
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:29,260
gained sentience and has named itself the Artificial
Lifeform for Running Extensive Duels, just

34
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,297
a rather very intelligent simulator 9000, or
Alfred Jarvis 9000. He has a quick message

35
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:42,137

51
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,901

they speculated on who would win between Luigi...

52
00:05:24,346 --> 00:05:26,026
and tails.

53
00:05:51,746 --> 00:05:56,748
to listen to all of the shows in the Dynamike
Podcast Network. But with that out of the way,

54
00:05:57,208 --> 00:06:03,690
quick to the NO Prize! A NO Prize is an award
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version,

55
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:08,452
the Dynamic Dual NO Prize, is a digital award
we post on Instagram and in our email newsletter

56
00:06:08,472 --> 00:06:13,034
for the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week we asked,

57
00:06:13,354 --> 00:06:20,457
what is your favorite alternate universe slash
dimension for Marvel or DC? We only got three

58
00:06:20,737 --> 00:06:25,460
answers. So we're gonna break down the two honorable
mentions before revealing this week's no prize

59
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:32,504
winner. Our first honorable mention goes to
Travis Herndon who said, Hey guys, Travis here.

60
00:06:32,544 --> 00:06:38,207
So my favorite alternate universe or dimension
would have to be the mangaverse. As a person

61
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:42,649
who loves anime and manga, I really like what
they did with some of the characters in that

62
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:49,673
universe. Like Spider-Man being a ninja, Wolverine
a samurai, Hulk being a kaiju, Godzilla monster

63
00:06:49,693 --> 00:06:55,473
do. It seemed like a pretty cool universe and
honestly, Marvel should make that into an animated

64
00:06:55,533 --> 00:07:00,797
series like they're doing with Suicide Squad.
So yeah, Mangaverse for me. Fantastic answer.

65
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:05,820
Yeah, I remember when the Mangaverse for Marvel
came out in the early 2000s. It looked super

66
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:12,044
fascinating. There was the Spider-Man series,
X-Men. There was an Avengers title, if I remember

67
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:17,948
correctly, and it was like an Iron Man Mecha
style subgenre of Manga. And yeah, there was

68
00:07:18,088 --> 00:07:24,129
the Hulk who was a 70 foot. Kaiju monster. It
was a really cool universe. I remember like

69
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:29,614
Punisher was like a lady samurai assassin type
character. It was pretty sweet. Good stuff.

70
00:07:29,654 --> 00:07:33,497
Good stuff. If you haven't checked it out and
you're into manga and you're into Marvel, definitely

71
00:07:33,537 --> 00:07:37,861
do that. I actually don't know anything about
this. I mean, I know about Spider-Man manga,

72
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:42,905
but I don't know about any of the other characters
and that all sounds pretty fricking awesome.

73
00:07:42,925 --> 00:07:46,729
I'm not going to lie. Yeah, that's a fantastic
answer. A fantastic other universe. If you

74
00:07:46,749 --> 00:07:51,264
guys are into manga, then you should also probably
be listening to the Send Your World podcast

75
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:55,268
as well. Great answer Travis! Our next honorable
mention goes to... Miggy Mathengian who said...

76
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:57,289
Hey what's up guys this is Miggy and I'm gonna
go with the first one, which is my favorite

77
00:07:57,309 --> 00:08:08,839
ultimate mention. It's the one where DC is like
medieval and there's like knights and dragons

78
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,682
and stuff like that. It's a pretty good story,
better than I thought it'd be. I wasn't really

79
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:21,752
expecting much from medieval. alternate universe,
but Tom Taylor knows what he's doing. So, thanks

80
00:08:21,772 --> 00:08:26,554
guys. Yeah, Dark Knights of Steel is a comic
book series written by Tom Taylor, who's also

81
00:08:26,594 --> 00:08:31,916
known for writing the Injustice comic as well
as Deceased. It's a high fantasy adventure,

82
00:08:32,016 --> 00:08:37,738
kind of like Game of Thrones, but with DC characters.
I actually haven't read anything from it. I

83
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:43,100
just know of it, and I gotta say it looks incredible
art-wise. And Miggy, who's an executive producer

84
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,903
of the podcast, is an avid comic book reader.
And I totally trust him when he says that something

85
00:08:47,943 --> 00:08:52,107
is really good. If he recommends Dark Knights
of Steel, that probably means I should be reading

86
00:08:52,287 --> 00:09:00,755
it along with everyone else. Not me, even you.
What? Yes. Great answers, guys. But that brings

87
00:09:00,815 --> 00:09:07,201
us to the winner of this week's no prize, Andrew
Shunk, who said, Hey, guys, Andrew Shunk here.

88
00:09:07,802 --> 00:09:17,243
My favorite alternate universe. Is. Marvel because
Marvel rips everything off of DC. Thanks. Have

89
00:09:17,263 --> 00:09:22,504
a nice day. And yeah, this gets the win because
Andrew Shunk admitted that Marvel is his favorite

90
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:28,426
and it's a great answer. Yeah. It should be
your favorite because it's amazing. Um, I liked

91
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:33,607
this answer not only because it admits that
Marvel is a rip off of DC, but I've also always

92
00:09:33,627 --> 00:09:40,769
held the theory that Marvel is just earth six
one six. Like they say it themselves. DC says

93
00:09:40,809 --> 00:09:47,623
we're earth one. Marvel says they're 616. Of
course DC is the true universe, the prime universe.

94
00:09:48,183 --> 00:09:51,924
It doesn't matter what's the true universe,
it matters what is his favorite and he clearly

95
00:09:52,024 --> 00:09:57,786
is a member of Team Marvel. So I will be changing
his name to Red on the Discord. Go Team Marvel.

96
00:09:58,246 --> 00:10:02,067
Great answer Andrew Shunk, you win this week's
no prize. If you the listener want a shot at

97
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:06,008
winning your own no prize, stay tuned to later
on this episode when we'll be asking another

98
00:10:06,288 --> 00:10:09,689
question of the week. And now that that's done,
on to the news.

99
00:10:15,426 --> 00:10:21,210
Alright, so a couple of days ago we learned
that Sean Gunn, James Gunn's brother, has been

100
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:29,277
cast as Maxwell Lord in the DC universe. James
Gunn, of course, being the new CEO of DC Studios.

101
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:34,441
Now this is pretty interesting because we recently
saw Maxwell Lord as a villain. He was played

102
00:10:34,461 --> 00:10:40,787
by Pedro Pascal. And I thought Pedro did a pretty
good job, even though the character was fairly

103
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:46,703
different from who Maxwell Lord is in the comics.
Now this isn't the only role that Sean Gunn

104
00:10:46,783 --> 00:10:53,307
is going to be playing in the DC universe. He
also plays Weasel in Creature Commandos. He's

105
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:58,230
supposed to be playing that character in both
live action and do voiceover work for animation.

106
00:10:58,351 --> 00:11:02,053
Well he also played the character in the Suicide
Squad movie too. Right, he did mocap work for

107
00:11:02,093 --> 00:11:06,556
it and I believe he was also the voice for the
character. Sean Gunn of course is no stranger

108
00:11:06,596 --> 00:11:12,163
to playing multiple roles within the same universe.
He did mocap work for Rocket Raccoon in Guardians

109
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:17,886
of the Galaxy, and he also played the live-action
version of Kraglin in the same franchise. Do

110
00:11:17,906 --> 00:11:23,309
you typically view Maxwell Lord as a villain
or as a hero character? I typically see him

111
00:11:23,549 --> 00:11:28,732
as a villain. In the comics, you know, he's
a benefactor for the Justice League, or he

112
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:33,995
was at one point. But overall, I would say throughout
the character's history, he's primarily been

113
00:11:34,155 --> 00:11:40,082
a villain. I think this is casting very much
against type. Sean Gunn tends to play roles

114
00:11:40,382 --> 00:11:46,804
of characters that aren't quite bright, usually.
So for him to play a character like Maxwell

115
00:11:46,844 --> 00:11:51,865
Lord, who is supposed to be hyper intelligent,
you know, he's a telepath, a mind reader, a

116
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:57,987
mind controller, is something that I never thought
I would see Sean Gunn play, honestly. So this

117
00:11:58,027 --> 00:12:02,548
casting to me is actually pretty surprising.
Well, I mean, he's a good character actor,

118
00:12:02,748 --> 00:12:07,469
but a role like Maxwell Lord would give him
an opportunity to showcase his range, you know?

119
00:12:07,714 --> 00:12:12,796
So I can see why they did this. It's gonna be
hard not to chalk this up to nepotism, which

120
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:18,199
a lot of people have been accusing James Gunn
of ever since, you know, casting his wife as

121
00:12:18,219 --> 00:12:23,482
a character in the Suicide Squad film and, you
know, Peacemaker series. That said, Sean Gunn

122
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:27,725
is not a terrible actor. You know, he's actually
pretty good. And I'll be looking forward to

123
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:32,587
seeing what he does with the role of Maxwell
Lord. It's rumored that while he's not going

124
00:12:32,648 --> 00:12:40,093
to appear in Superman Legacy, he will be name
dropped at the very least. I wouldn't be surprised

125
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:44,717
if we saw Maxwell Lord in something like the
Amanda Waller television series or maybe Peacemaker

126
00:12:44,757 --> 00:12:49,380
2. We're not sure yet, but if he's been cast,
I'm sure they'll be announcing what project

127
00:12:49,421 --> 00:12:53,704
he's a part of relatively soon. I like to think
that if I ever directed a movie, Jonathan,

128
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:58,268
I'd give you a part. Hey, man, if I'm the lead
making the big bucks, I'll do it. No, you wouldn't

129
00:12:58,288 --> 00:13:03,833
be the lead. God, no. What? I mean, all right.
Maybe I don't want to be a part of your movie,

130
00:13:03,873 --> 00:13:09,634
then. I'll let you star in my movie, it's gonna
be called Joseph Sucks. It's gonna be about

131
00:13:09,654 --> 00:13:17,161
how much you suck. Well, at least I'll be the
star of that one. Yeah, you will be. But speaking

132
00:13:17,222 --> 00:13:22,427
of how James Gunn has taken one of his Guardians
of the Galaxy actors and cast them in a DC

133
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:25,009
role, that brings us to our question of the
week.

134
00:13:29,494 --> 00:13:34,837
What other actor from the Guardians of the Galaxy
would you like to see cast in the DC universe

episode a little bit earlier, so you guys don't

have as much time this week. Yeah, get your
answers in right away. In other DC news, Suicide

142
00:14:11,323 --> 00:14:17,365
Squad Kill the Justice League recently released
a new trailer titled the official Justice League

143
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:22,027
trailer. Of course, it seems like we've been
waiting for this game forever. I've personally

144
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:25,809
really been looking forward to this because
just the concept of it is really interesting.

145
00:14:25,849 --> 00:14:30,450
The fact that the Justice League characters
are going to be possessed by Brainiac and be

146
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:35,952
the bad guys is kind of awesome. And we got
some really good looks at them, some for the

147
00:14:35,992 --> 00:14:40,453
first time in this trailer. Yeah, the Suicide
Squad is going to be going up against Green

148
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:46,495
Lantern, the Flash, Batman and Superman and
also Wonder Woman. Although it looks like she's

149
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:51,436
not possessed by Brainiac in the same way that
the others are, at least initially. What intrigues

150
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:56,557
me about this is that this game is supposed
to be set in the same universe as the Arkham

151
00:14:56,577 --> 00:15:04,439
video games. And yet, spoiler alert, Batman
died at the end of Arkham Knight. So it kind

152
00:15:04,459 --> 00:15:09,903
of seems like this game takes place before that.
I don't know, there's like a big demon version

153
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:14,427
of Batman sporadically throughout this trailer.
Maybe that has something to do with it. Like

154
00:15:14,527 --> 00:15:18,290
the Suicide Squad goes to hell or something
like that. Oh shit, Batman's in hell? That's

155
00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:23,474
crazy. Yeah, dude, he beats up poor people.
Of course, that's a one way ticket to hell.

156
00:15:23,915 --> 00:15:28,030
Wow. I hate Saturday Night Live. They suck.

157
00:15:31,132 --> 00:15:36,615
There's quite a bit of gameplay footage in this
trailer and it still looks as awesome as ever

158
00:15:36,655 --> 00:15:41,197
did. Apparently, the game is in beta testing
right now. One of our executive producers,

159
00:15:41,298 --> 00:15:47,101
the host of Sanjo World, Zachary Hepburn, is
actually playing the beta right now. And he

160
00:15:47,141 --> 00:15:51,584
says it's just incredible. And I'm inclined
to believe him. It does look like a fun game.

161
00:15:51,624 --> 00:15:57,186
I like how each player has their own kind of
gameplay style. where Harley Quinn almost feels

162
00:15:57,206 --> 00:16:02,649
like a Spider-Man type game. You know, King
Shark is your bruiser. Deadshot is like your

163
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:07,030
third person shooter. And then you have Captain
Boomerang, who's like, I don't know, like the

164
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,472
speedster. Everyone's gonna have their favorite
character to play with. It looks like it's

165
00:16:10,492 --> 00:16:15,154
gonna be a blast. And actually it's not gonna
be limited to just these four characters. Data

166
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:19,776
miners have been going through the code of the
game and found out that you can play as Killer

167
00:16:19,816 --> 00:16:24,454
Croc as an alternate skin for King Shark, I
believe. That's pretty cool. Yeah, it really

168
00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:28,095
makes me wonder what other alternate skins you'll
get to play as. Which member of the Justice

169
00:16:28,115 --> 00:16:32,697
League do you think is going to be the hardest
boss to beat? It should be Superman. He should

170
00:16:32,737 --> 00:16:36,899
be like the final boss. Absolutely. And I think
they kind of imply that much just with like

171
00:16:36,939 --> 00:16:42,221
the Suicide Squad's reaction to him in this
trailer. That said, the giant demon version

172
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:47,504
of Batman does look like it's going to be hella
tough to get through. The new official release

173
00:16:47,564 --> 00:16:53,839
date for this game is February 2nd of next year.
I'm. somehow going to have to get my hands

174
00:16:54,099 --> 00:17:01,064
on a Xbox or PlayStation five before that time
or a PC. Yeah, no, that's not happening. I'm

175
00:17:01,084 --> 00:17:07,008
an Apple guy. So here's hoping that I've been
good this year and Santa brings me one. Well,

176
00:17:07,028 --> 00:17:11,150
I hope you get it. I hope you have a lot of
fun with it. Rocksteady is a solid studio for

177
00:17:11,191 --> 00:17:17,235
video games, as is Bethesda, who just announced
that they are working on a Blade game. Now,

178
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:23,294
Bethesda is the video game studio behind such
titles as The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Doom,

179
00:17:23,734 --> 00:17:29,516
Dishonored, a bunch of great, well-received
games. And so this is some pretty exciting

180
00:17:29,576 --> 00:17:34,177
news that they're working on a Blade game. The
announcement trailer is not really much of

181
00:17:34,297 --> 00:17:39,199
anything. It's basically just Blade getting
a shave and then some kind of alarm goes off

182
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:43,080
and he's like, the knife's just getting started
and he, you know, looks like he's going to

183
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,921
take out his sword. The style of it is pretty
cool though. There's some pretty interesting

184
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:52,319
music in it and the graphics look pretty damn
good. Yeah, the world that they establish just

185
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:58,422
in this teaser reminds me very much of the very
first Blade movie, with like the time lapse

186
00:17:58,763 --> 00:18:04,666
of the skyscraper, skyline shadows moving across
the city. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know what city

187
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:09,909
this is. It does appear to be some kind of European
city, which makes sense because the character

188
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:14,131
of Blade, Eric Brooks, is from London. I'm always
a little bit disappointed when they don't give

189
00:18:14,151 --> 00:18:17,913
the character a British accent. He does not
have a British accent in this trailer. It's

190
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:22,191
definitely American. But yeah, it looks like
he's going international with his vampire hunting.

191
00:18:22,612 --> 00:18:26,835
Yeah, whatever city it is, it's definitely a
melting pot. You have like Spanish, you have,

192
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:32,839
I believe Arabic. You have a number of languages
scrawled across the city walls. But it also

193
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:38,022
seems like vampires have taken over the city
and the government has issued like a curfew

194
00:18:38,282 --> 00:18:43,486
for people to be indoors once the sun sets.
So that's an interesting setup for the story.

195
00:18:43,646 --> 00:18:47,168
Yeah, people in this world definitely know that
vampires exist. It's not really a secret. They're

196
00:18:47,188 --> 00:18:52,500
not like underground or anything when Blade's
barber nicks himself with the shaving razor,

197
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:56,663
he gets nervous that Blade is going to attack
him. But of course, as Blade says, he doesn't

198
00:18:56,683 --> 00:19:02,467
fight. So there you go. Yeah, it's not much
of a trailer and we have no idea what the gameplay

199
00:19:02,487 --> 00:19:05,869
is going to be like. I assume it might be like
some kind of hack and slash thing like God

200
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:11,513
of War or Devil May Cry. And that would be awesome.
I'm already sold. Already sold. Well, I played

201
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:17,857
a Blade video game way back in the day on the
PS2. It was the Blade 2 movie tie-in video

202
00:19:18,674 --> 00:19:22,938
And man, that game was a piece of shit. It was
so weird that the fighting system was bizarre

203
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:28,883
because you would use the second joystick controller
to attack. You just point it in a direction

204
00:19:28,943 --> 00:19:32,967
and he would like kick in that direction because
in the game you would often be surrounded by

205
00:19:33,007 --> 00:19:37,932
vampires. So you wouldn't hit buttons to attack.
The joystick literally would attack in the

206
00:19:37,972 --> 00:19:42,116
direction that you pointed at. So it was a little
bit awkward. Maybe it sounds cool in theory,

207
00:19:42,236 --> 00:19:46,908
but it just didn't pan out in practice. Well,
I feel like video games have come a long way,

208
00:19:47,028 --> 00:19:50,632
like, you know, with the Arkham games and that
battle system. And, you know, I'm sure Spider-Man

209
00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:55,477
is very similar to it. Yeah. So I feel like
for sure you could really nail a Blade video

210
00:19:55,517 --> 00:20:00,722
game nowadays. We'll see if we get the video
game before the movie. It's cool to know that

211
00:20:00,822 --> 00:20:04,065
Blade really seems to be coming back into the
spotlight now, though. Can't wait.

212
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:15,549
Well, I think that does it for all of the news
for this episode. So now let's move on to the

213
00:20:15,629 --> 00:20:21,773
main event where we review Amazon Prime's holiday
animated film, Merry Little Batman.

214
00:20:37,086 --> 00:20:42,290
Alright, Merry Little Batman is an animated
feature released on the Amazon Prime streaming

215
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:48,115
platform just in time for the holiday season.
Directed by Mike Roth of regular show fame,

216
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:54,060
in his film directorial debut, the film follows
Damian Wayne, Batman's son, as he aspires to

217
00:20:54,100 --> 00:21:01,867
become a superhero like his father during Christmas.
It's super cute, super made for kids, but the

218
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:07,626
best most nostalgic holiday films usually are.
And that's what I like about it. If you're

219
00:21:07,646 --> 00:21:12,548
looking for something new this holiday season
to watch with the kids, I definitely recommend

220
00:21:12,668 --> 00:21:18,149
Mary Little Batman. And if you want to go in
fresh with the family, I also recommend skipping

221
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:24,191
this review altogether as it contains spoilers.
Yeah, definitely check out Mary Little Batman.

222
00:21:24,211 --> 00:21:29,492
If you have Amazon Prime, it's an easy watch.
It's a quick watch. If you like Batman or your

223
00:21:29,552 --> 00:21:34,979
family loves superheroes, I highly recommend
it for this holiday season. gets a crisp 92

224
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:39,721
minute film. So almost exactly an hour and a
half. You won't regret it. Now the holiday

225
00:21:39,741 --> 00:21:45,045
season truly is the most wonderful time of the
year for my two daughters. Their birthdays

226
00:21:45,085 --> 00:21:51,449
fall on December 22nd and 23rd. I tell people
that in my family, it's like having four full

227
00:21:51,489 --> 00:21:56,392
days of Christmas each year. But honestly, the
excitement and festivities for Christmas ramp

228
00:21:56,512 --> 00:22:02,892
up exponentially after Thanksgiving. beginning
with holiday music on the radio and Christmas

229
00:22:02,932 --> 00:22:08,335
movies after dinner. Films like How the Grinch
Stole Christmas Home Alone. These and more

230
00:22:08,435 --> 00:22:14,118
have become annual viewing traditions, as they
are for many families, I'm sure. And after

231
00:22:14,138 --> 00:22:18,941
getting the chance to see Merry Little Batman
on the theater big screen, my family all easily

232
00:22:18,981 --> 00:22:23,864
agreed that this movie should be a part of our
annual rotation, which it's already become,

233
00:22:24,104 --> 00:22:28,482
because we've actually watched it again since
it came out on Amazon Prime. Now the movie

234
00:22:28,502 --> 00:22:34,785
was inspired visually by the artwork of English
cartoonist Ronald Cyril, who inspired the character

235
00:22:34,825 --> 00:22:41,489
design for quite a few animated films such as
101 Dalmatians and Despicable Me. This film

236
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:46,812
though I think captures the charm and humor
of his aesthetic more than any other film.

237
00:22:47,152 --> 00:22:52,755
From Alfred to Joker to Selena the Cat, the
Cyril-esque character design is one of the

238
00:22:52,775 --> 00:22:58,058
highlights of the film. And watching the way
these awkward bodies move... particularly in

239
00:22:58,078 --> 00:23:04,500
the case of the Joker, contributed to the humor
of the film. Oh yeah, the art style is so silly,

240
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:10,281
but perfectly in keeping with the whimsical
attitude of the film. I was actually really

241
00:23:10,301 --> 00:23:14,842
impressed because I think that this is the best
version of that art style ever done in a full

242
00:23:14,862 --> 00:23:19,764
length feature. Oh yeah, I agree. Everything
from like the line work to even the coloring

243
00:23:20,044 --> 00:23:23,865
and the way it was like constantly shifting,
almost like a little kid drew it. It was really

244
00:23:23,885 --> 00:23:28,343
charming. It was like an animated comic strip.
And, you know, being a big fan of like Calvin

245
00:23:28,363 --> 00:23:33,387
and Hobbes and a bunch of other comic book strips
growing up, I really appreciated that. Yeah,

246
00:23:33,407 --> 00:23:38,011
I thought it was fantastic. I'm actually kind
of sad that this film debuted on a streaming

247
00:23:38,051 --> 00:23:42,055
platform and people didn't get the opportunity
to watch it on the big screen, because I think

248
00:23:42,095 --> 00:23:46,699
this could have easily been a theatrical release.
I think families would have got to see it.

249
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:52,223
I mean, this past weekend, Miyazaki animated
film The Boy and His Heron won the weekend.

250
00:23:52,584 --> 00:23:56,550
Like, if this would have been released at the
same time. I think it could have been a contender

251
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:00,953
to get the number one box office spot for this
week. Yeah, I mean, like I liked this movie

252
00:24:01,013 --> 00:24:05,975
more than the Lego Batman movie, both in terms
of story and animation style. So yeah, I could

253
00:24:05,995 --> 00:24:11,018
totally see this working in theaters. The movie
is just silly and funny. And I think a lot

254
00:24:11,058 --> 00:24:16,841
of that has to do with the writers for the movie,
Morgan Evans and Jace Ricci, who have written

255
00:24:16,921 --> 00:24:22,304
for Teen Titans Go and the Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles cartoon, respectively. But there's

256
00:24:22,324 --> 00:24:29,099
a third writer as well. who wrote Tropic Thunder,
and who I think leveled up the humor to a point

257
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:33,842
where adults could find it funny as well. That's
actually surprising to me because the humor

258
00:24:33,862 --> 00:24:39,464
isn't terribly adult, it's actually quite childish,
but charming. I wouldn't say it's dumbed down

259
00:24:39,584 --> 00:24:44,547
for kids, but it's definitely not raunched up
for adults or anything. It's at that perfect

260
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:48,769
level where I think both kids and adults can
enjoy it. I agree, it's like that sweet spot

261
00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:53,486
right in the middle, especially for a holiday
film. The writers also injected tons of holiday

262
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:59,528
homages into the film as well, from the obvious
like Home Alone and how the Grinch stole Christmas,

263
00:24:59,768 --> 00:25:05,469
but also deep cuts like Die Hard when we see
Damien shuffling through air ducts. For DC

264
00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:10,671
fans, there were also homages to Batman films
of the past, primarily when it came to the

265
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:16,833
villains, but also things like Batnipples and
the Batpod. Yeah, I saw references to Batman

266
00:25:16,853 --> 00:25:20,990
and Robin, Batman Returns, The Dark Knight,
yeah a bunch of them. And those are things

267
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:26,511
that you could kind of appreciate as an adult,
especially as an adult fan of DC Comics, because,

268
00:25:26,531 --> 00:25:30,853
you know, a lot of kids watching the movie aren't
going to get the Batnipples reference. Now,

269
00:25:30,873 --> 00:25:35,934
while some can knock the film's unoriginality,
I actually think that's the worst thing you

270
00:25:35,954 --> 00:25:40,476
could say about the movie. And ultimately, it
was all put together in a funny, heartwarming

271
00:25:40,516 --> 00:25:46,657
package. Apparently, a spinoff series called
Bat Family is in the works for Amazon Prime.

272
00:25:46,942 --> 00:25:52,046
with Mike Roth to serve as the showrunner. And
I'm looking forward to it. Yeah, I could totally

273
00:25:52,066 --> 00:25:58,032
see a series based off of this. This type of
content is perfect for an animated show. And

274
00:25:58,072 --> 00:26:02,376
the world that they built is so rich that it
would be a shame not to continue it. Right,

275
00:26:02,416 --> 00:26:07,621
yeah, and I also think there were enough references
to the larger world, like Damien's mom, for

276
00:26:07,681 --> 00:26:12,858
example, that there's enough to explore there
for an animated series. I just want to make

277
00:26:13,058 --> 00:26:18,760
one more point that the songs used in this film
were awesome. Like the opening with Father

278
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:23,702
Christmas by the Kinks, All I Really Want for
Christmas by Little John Later On, along with

279
00:26:23,802 --> 00:26:28,444
Don De Esta Santa Claus, and at the very end,
just another Christmas song, This Time I'll

280
00:26:28,484 --> 00:26:34,046
Sing Along. These aren't typical songs you hear
in family Christmas movies, but they had me

281
00:26:34,106 --> 00:26:38,648
dancing in my seat and singing on the car ride
home. They were all great songs, yeah. And

282
00:26:38,688 --> 00:26:43,506
Patrick Stump from Followboy is the one who
did the music. I knew I recognized that name

283
00:26:43,546 --> 00:26:48,448
from somewhere. That's awesome. I was listening
to the score for this film earlier and yeah,

284
00:26:48,468 --> 00:26:52,890
it was really good. He's a great composer. Yeah,
I didn't even know he did film work until this

285
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:56,871
movie, but he's done some work for Marvel too,
including the Spidey and His Amazing Friends

286
00:26:56,912 --> 00:27:01,653
television series. Did not know that. That's
pretty cool. I definitely recommend checking

287
00:27:01,713 --> 00:27:06,675
out the soundtrack to this if anyone hasn't
already. But moving on to the character breakdown,

288
00:27:07,196 --> 00:27:14,047
let's start with Damien Wayne, AKA Little Batman
for this movie. Surprisingly not Robin. Yeah,

289
00:27:14,127 --> 00:27:19,570
surprisingly. I thought that was an interesting
choice. The character was voiced by Jonas Kibrib.

290
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:25,253
I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing that correctly
at all. I'm not familiar with Jonas's work,

291
00:27:25,613 --> 00:27:30,116
but I thought he pulled off the role as perfect
as you can get. You know, he nailed the emotion

292
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:35,559
and the humor needed for the character. Just
a great like little kid voice, essentially.

293
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:40,481
Yeah, I was actually surprised at his level
of range and comedic timing. Great delivery.

294
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:46,241
Yeah, now this of course is not the first time
we've seen Damien in animated form. We've seen

295
00:27:46,301 --> 00:27:51,665
him as Robin, of course in the past. But this
is the first time that I can recall that we've

296
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:56,948
seen him this young. You know, I have an eight
year old and it's a pretty fun imaginative

297
00:27:57,149 --> 00:28:03,353
age. In this film, Damien imagines being like
his father Batman, though he doesn't realize

298
00:28:03,393 --> 00:28:08,676
the hardship that comes with being a superhero
because his father rid Gotham of crime when

299
00:28:08,716 --> 00:28:16,243
Damien was just a baby. Damien was told what
to do in any emergency except for crime. So

300
00:28:16,283 --> 00:28:20,865
when the burglars break into his house, he's
forced to jump into the role of a superhero

301
00:28:20,985 --> 00:28:26,866
on his own. When his utility belt, the gift
his father gave him for Christmas, is stolen,

302
00:28:27,226 --> 00:28:32,628
he makes a vow to get it back. That's the focus
part of the lesson his father told him, that

303
00:28:32,688 --> 00:28:39,603
crime fighting requires focus, responsibility,
and sacrifice. By the end of Damien's adventure,

304
00:28:39,723 --> 00:28:45,907
he accepts responsibility for the chaos he caused
across Gotham and sacrifices his prized possession,

305
00:28:46,188 --> 00:28:51,572
his utility belt, to make things right. The
entire film, Damien was trying to prove to

306
00:28:51,612 --> 00:28:56,275
his father that he wasn't a baby and that he
was ready to be a superhero and he thought

307
00:28:56,315 --> 00:29:01,439
that by losing his utility belt, his dad would
think that he wasn't ready for that. But that

308
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:06,998
wasn't going to prove anything, as the Bat Dad
AI explained. It wasn't until Damien proved

309
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:12,699
himself capable in battle that Batman rewarded
Damien with a real utility belt and accepted

310
00:29:12,739 --> 00:29:18,501
him as his partner. I'm consistently surprised
how many different ways writers can take the

311
00:29:18,521 --> 00:29:23,622
character of Damien Wayne, who is relatively
new to the world of comics. But we recently

312
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:28,124
saw an adaptation of Damien Wayne in an animated
feature film as recently as last year in the

313
00:29:28,164 --> 00:29:33,385
Battle of the Supersuns, where he was also used
to great effect. And then you see how he was

314
00:29:33,425 --> 00:29:37,770
done here, and you just... realize how versatile
the character is, you can go super dark with

315
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:42,492
him, you can go super light with him, it all
works. Definitely one of the best characters

316
00:29:42,512 --> 00:29:46,693
to be introduced within the past couple decades.
Yeah, he's sort of like his father in that

317
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:52,034
regard. I know a lot of people don't like bright
and cheerful Batman sort of like he was in

318
00:29:52,094 --> 00:29:57,916
this movie, but the character still works somehow
in that regard. I definitely prefer my Batman

319
00:29:58,156 --> 00:30:03,637
very, very dark, but I also don't mind when
they adapt him into like new worlds like this.

320
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:09,693
Yeah, I mean, it just all depends on the world
that he exists in, right? In a world as light

321
00:30:09,853 --> 00:30:16,158
and cheery as this one, a lighter, cheerier
Batman makes sense. Right. Speaking of Batman,

322
00:30:16,378 --> 00:30:22,682
let's move on to him, aka Bruce Wayne, who is
voiced by Luke Wilson. Now, Luke Wilson would

323
00:30:22,782 --> 00:30:28,482
never have been my first choice for Batman,
but in this lighter I thought he brought the

324
00:30:28,562 --> 00:30:34,007
right amount of brightness to the role, along
with familiarity. He's really the only voice

325
00:30:34,107 --> 00:30:38,090
you hear in this film where it's like, hey,
I know that voice. Yeah, it's cool to hear

326
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:42,874
him, especially considering we just got off
of Loki Season 2, which stars his brother Owen

327
00:30:42,894 --> 00:30:46,837
Wilson. So to see the Wilson bros getting in
on the Marvel and DC content is pretty neat.

328
00:30:47,237 --> 00:30:52,421
That is cool. That's really cool. Now, like
I mentioned earlier, this is very much an Elseworlds

329
00:30:52,461 --> 00:30:58,450
Batman. which may in fact piss off fans of Batman,
but I'm guessing those people don't have children

330
00:30:58,931 --> 00:31:04,836
or a life. In this film, Batman learns about
Damien much earlier than in the comics and

331
00:31:04,876 --> 00:31:09,940
works overtime to rid Gotham of crime and villains
so that the city is a good one to raise a child

332
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:16,366
in. Bruce is overprotective you could say, but
as Alfred tells Damien, Bruce wants to give

333
00:31:16,406 --> 00:31:23,482
his son the one thing he never had, a childhood.
which means Damien gets foam batarangs before

334
00:31:23,522 --> 00:31:29,704
metal ones. Bruce knows, however, that Damien's
destined to take up his mantle one day, so

335
00:31:29,744 --> 00:31:35,986
it was nice to see that the master of prep time
would be prepared with Damien's batsuit way

336
00:31:36,106 --> 00:31:43,009
early. A high-tech version that not only sizes
itself to Damien's body, but also comes with

337
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:48,418
a built-in artificial intelligence called Bat
Dad. that was based on Bruce's mind so that

338
00:31:48,438 --> 00:31:53,560
his son would never be alone like he was growing
up. Yeah that was really touching. The AI was

339
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,042
cool too, I thought that was a pretty neat concept.
Yeah, it's something I think that all fathers

340
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:02,204
wish that they could leave their children in
some way. When Batman returns to Gotham to

341
00:32:02,244 --> 00:32:08,314
help his son, initially he holds Damian back,
protecting him from his villains. But the years

342
00:32:08,354 --> 00:32:13,458
without crime apparently made him soft because
he gets knocked out only to witness his son's

343
00:32:13,578 --> 00:32:19,902
awesome ninja skills in action when he awakens
and decides that Damien is a capable and worthwhile

344
00:32:19,962 --> 00:32:25,006
partner after all. That's pretty much his whole
arc and it's nice that he found a way to connect

345
00:32:25,046 --> 00:32:31,558
to his son in a way that he was never able to
with his own father, his parents. Basically,

346
00:32:31,718 --> 00:32:36,282
he comes to terms with the idea that his preconceived
notions of his son aren't necessarily what

347
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:42,367
he thought and he is surprised Which I assume
happens a lot in parenthood Do you ever find

348
00:32:42,387 --> 00:32:46,590
yourself being like overly cautious only to
realize that the kids are a little bit more

349
00:32:46,790 --> 00:32:51,614
Capable than you thought they were? Not really,
honestly I'm surprised by them in ways that

350
00:32:51,654 --> 00:32:57,346
like when they draw a picture above the skill
typical of their age range I'm surprised when

351
00:32:57,366 --> 00:33:01,868
you know, they know how to do something on their
iPad that like, I didn't even know it's things

352
00:33:01,888 --> 00:33:07,351
like that. Right, right. I did get a roundhouse
kick to the chest one time for my oldest daughter

353
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:15,636
that actually hurt. I guess that was surprising.
We were just horsing around and I think she

354
00:33:15,816 --> 00:33:18,337
didn't know her own strength or her dad's own
weakness.

355
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:27,594
I mean, who among you can take a roundhouse
kick to the chest? Like a jumping one. It's

356
00:33:27,654 --> 00:33:34,238
not an easy thing to take. I do have to ask,
what did you think of the bat beard? I like

357
00:33:34,258 --> 00:33:39,140
the bat beard. I think it was a way to distinguish
the superhero Batman from the father Batman.

358
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:43,743
So it was clear that like this was not like
Batman as he normally is. This is like Batman

359
00:33:43,843 --> 00:33:48,246
very much in dad mode. I understand why they
did it. They just kind of wanted to show that

360
00:33:48,386 --> 00:33:53,909
Batman had become relaxed and more comfortable
having not to deal with crime in some time.

361
00:33:54,469 --> 00:33:58,451
I didn't like it, though. I don't think I would
hate it for Superman, but I don't think Batman

362
00:33:58,471 --> 00:34:05,736
should ever have any facial hair. Moving on
to the Joker, he was voiced by David Hornsby.

363
00:34:06,216 --> 00:34:13,541
This was definitely more of a shrill Tony Hale-like
performance than a menacing Mark Hamill, but

364
00:34:13,701 --> 00:34:18,844
again, it was appropriate for the project and
actually pretty funny, I thought. Which like

365
00:34:18,884 --> 00:34:24,797
no matter the medium, if your Joker's not funny...
Even in a dark, like, I can't believe I'm laughing

366
00:34:24,837 --> 00:34:29,302
at this kind of funny. I questioned whether
it was a successful Joker. Yeah. And I like

367
00:34:29,342 --> 00:34:35,991
how this one loved the Jingle Bells Batman Smell
song. I love how this one would just like do

368
00:34:36,031 --> 00:34:39,594
the most random things. Like he's talking to
someone on the phone, then all of a sudden

369
00:34:39,614 --> 00:34:44,778
he's like typing on a keyboard, ha ha. That
was a great gag. It was just bizarre. It was

370
00:34:44,798 --> 00:34:49,502
a bizarre Joker. I think that's, you know, I
also made for a fairly good Joker as well though.

371
00:34:49,662 --> 00:34:54,246
In that he was like unpredictable. Now in this
universe, the Joker seemingly retired from

372
00:34:54,306 --> 00:35:00,827
super villainy and has taken up residence in
a candy making factory. In his own words, Joker

373
00:35:00,887 --> 00:35:07,110
grew lonely, missing the laughter he had with
his villainous allies and crimes, so he concocted

374
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:13,634
a plan to steal Christmas from Gotham and bring
back crime to the city. Damien's actions, however,

375
00:35:13,914 --> 00:35:19,537
as a little Batman changed his plans, and upon
realizing the destructive potential of Damien,

376
00:35:19,678 --> 00:35:25,641
Joker used him as a distraction for Gotham,
while Poison Ivy, Penguin, and Bane stole everyone's

377
00:35:25,701 --> 00:35:32,155
presents. Joker thought he had another ally
in Little Batman, but he was proven wrong in

378
00:35:32,215 --> 00:35:38,617
the end. Still, the pitiful nature of the Joker
story here touched Damian's heart, and at the

379
00:35:38,757 --> 00:35:44,719
end, Joker ended up spending Christmas dinner
with the Bat Family, which holy crap, that's

380
00:35:44,939 --> 00:35:49,760
nothing we've ever seen in the comics, but was
a heartwarming touch to end the story with,

381
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,581
sort of a love your enemies type of message.
Well Batman clearly didn't want to be there.

382
00:35:55,054 --> 00:36:00,358
I think it was only done because of Damien's
insistence. I liked how this is not only a

383
00:36:00,418 --> 00:36:05,082
funny joker, but also a smart joker. Like he
was able to outwit this little eight year old

384
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:10,707
kid and was always a few steps ahead of the
game. It makes sense that he wouldn't be outwitted

385
00:36:10,847 --> 00:36:16,912
by a kid. Right. I like how he was able to manipulate
Damien into villainy of sorts, because like

386
00:36:16,932 --> 00:36:21,415
in the comics, Damien is such like an asshole
little kid that you're never quite sure if

387
00:36:21,435 --> 00:36:25,818
he's going to grow up to be like the world's
greatest superhero. or worst supervillain.

388
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:30,759
You've seen it go both ways, sort of like in
the Injustice comics compared to like Deceased.

389
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:35,041
In the former, he becomes fairly villainous
and in the latter becomes like the greatest

390
00:36:35,101 --> 00:36:40,062
superhero. There's always kind of that flirtation
with villainy, especially because of his mother

391
00:36:40,202 --> 00:36:45,384
Talia El-Ghul and Ras El-Ghul, his grandfather,
the whole League of Assassins thing. I thought

392
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:50,285
this was an interesting way to sort of play
up on that ambiguity with the character. But

393
00:36:50,665 --> 00:36:55,696
yeah. Damien, Batman, Joker, those are really
the three main characters of the movie. Of

394
00:36:55,736 --> 00:37:01,059
course, Alfred also plays a fairly major role,
although there's not too much to discuss there.

395
00:37:01,279 --> 00:37:06,022
He was voiced by James Cromwell, who I didn't
even recognize his voice in this movie. I thought

396
00:37:06,042 --> 00:37:12,845
he did a fantastic job in the role. He was an
adorable Alfred, I gotta say. So cute! And

397
00:37:12,885 --> 00:37:18,468
very much inspired visually, I think, by the
Alfred from the 60s television series. I think.

398
00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:22,937
At least that was the impression I got. But
let's move on to the story highlights.

00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:30,901
Thank you guys so much. Playing superhero, Damien
chases his cat Selena through Wayne Manor and

411
00:38:31,041 --> 00:38:36,004
ends up in the basement where his father Bruce
reminds Damien that upon learning that he was

412
00:38:36,044 --> 00:38:40,968
going to be a father, Batman worked overtime
to bring down crime in Gotham City, locking

413
00:38:41,048 --> 00:38:46,732
up all of the supervillains or forcing them
to retire. Gotham City has since become a crime-free

414
00:38:46,772 --> 00:38:51,755
haven for the past eight years. The whole eight
years without crime thing, that reminded me

415
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:56,702
a lot of The Dark Knight Rises. It was the same
amount of time. where Gotham was apparently

416
00:38:56,902 --> 00:39:02,625
like crime free. Now at breakfast on Christmas
Eve, Bruce lets Damien open a Christmas present

417
00:39:02,785 --> 00:39:08,147
early, which turns out to be a utility belt
full of safety gear, which Damien has mixed

418
00:39:08,187 --> 00:39:13,529
feelings about. When the emergency bat phone
begins ringing, Bruce learns from the Justice

419
00:39:13,549 --> 00:39:18,391
League that he's needed on a case in Nova Scotia,
though he promises Damien to be back before

420
00:39:18,451 --> 00:39:24,186
Christmas. After Damien gets caught trying to
stow away aboard the bat plane, Bruce punishes

421
00:39:24,226 --> 00:39:29,889
Damian by taking back the utility belt, which
he gives to Alfred. I like the items that Batman

422
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:34,751
included in his utility belt, like band-aids,
a whistle, things like that. Just things to

423
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:40,053
protect him. Yeah, the way they animated the
foam battering just like floating down, I just

424
00:39:40,073 --> 00:39:44,195
found that hilarious. I don't know why. There
are also some other pretty funny things that

425
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:49,017
happened during these scenes, like when Batman
and Damian were fighting over the utility belts.

426
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:56,251
And Damien accidentally knocks Alfred over and
Alfred's like, Oh, my good hip. I was like,

427
00:39:56,271 --> 00:40:02,513
Oh no. To lift Damien's spirits, Alfred prepares
a meticulous cup of hot cocoa, though Damien

428
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:07,775
eats all of the marshmallows before it's completed,
forcing Alfred to leave to the store and allowing

429
00:40:07,855 --> 00:40:13,716
Damien to steal back his utility belt. En route
to the store, Alfred nearly has a car accident

430
00:40:13,736 --> 00:40:18,398
with a couple of burglars stealing Christmas
presents from the neighborhood. while Damien

431
00:40:18,438 --> 00:40:24,742
trains recklessly throughout the mansion. Meanwhile,
Batman becomes stranded on a Canadian mountain

432
00:40:24,762 --> 00:40:30,885
during a snowstorm after the Batplane malfunctions.
I'm glad now that I have Alfred's recipe for

433
00:40:30,905 --> 00:40:36,309
hot cocoa. I thought it was hilarious how Damien
was just eating all of the marshmallows. Like,

434
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:41,331
marshmallows are not an easy thing to eat. I
feel like after a couple, I just felt sick.

435
00:40:41,692 --> 00:40:47,748
So the fact that he was eating like entire bags
full, I was like... Oh, that's, I felt that.

436
00:40:48,289 --> 00:40:54,375
He also like carb loaded during his training
montage. All right. It's so gross. Yeah. Way

437
00:40:54,395 --> 00:40:58,459
too much. That was kind of like Home Alone 2.
I was actually surprised when we saw the two

438
00:40:58,479 --> 00:41:02,923
bandits going around stealing from all the different
mansions in the Wayne Manor area, because I

439
00:41:02,983 --> 00:41:06,927
didn't know they were going to have this Home
Alone sequence where he actually went up against

440
00:41:07,067 --> 00:41:12,138
burglars, but that's coming up later in the
story. Right. After Damien accidentally causes

441
00:41:12,278 --> 00:41:18,121
a short that disables the manor's main gate,
he's forced to defend his home from the burglars.

442
00:41:18,681 --> 00:41:24,463
After succumbing to Damien's torture and traps,
the burglars flee the mansion, albeit with

443
00:41:24,543 --> 00:41:30,546
Damien's utility belt to his dismay. Vowing
to get it back, Damien races to the Batcave,

444
00:41:30,806 --> 00:41:35,908
where he finds an AI-powered bat suit that Bruce
designed for Damien and programmed himself

445
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:40,766
into in case he ever died and crime returned
to Gotham. After stealing the suit and the

446
00:41:40,806 --> 00:41:46,589
bat pod cycle, Damien races into the city to
find the burglars who took his utility belts.

447
00:41:46,909 --> 00:41:51,371
The burglar characters were hilarious, and Damien
was such a badass during the whole scene where

448
00:41:51,411 --> 00:41:55,373
he was terrorizing him. Those are my favorite
parts of the movie. Yeah, I went a little over

449
00:41:55,413 --> 00:42:00,875
the top with like the grease fire thing. I was
like, holy shit. But I mean, I guess it was

450
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:07,358
as bad as a Home Alone movie. Right. Yeah, he
totally would have murdered these guys. I like

451
00:42:07,438 --> 00:42:12,300
when Damien, when the pre-recorded video of
Bruce talking to Damien actually accounted

452
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:18,804
for the possibility that Damien might be stealing
the suit. That was pretty funny. He's like,

453
00:42:18,824 --> 00:42:22,346
either I'm dead or you're stealing the suit,
in which case you're in big trouble, mister.

454
00:42:24,427 --> 00:42:29,210
Yeah, that was great. I also love how long it
took to get into the Batcave. Like there was

455
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:34,172
this whole really elaborate sequence that included
everything from multiple elevators to like

456
00:42:34,252 --> 00:42:39,311
rappelling down the side of a waterfall. It
was great. It went on longer than it should

457
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:44,474
have, but that was the gag. I like the gag where
he didn't know how to work the clutch on the

458
00:42:44,494 --> 00:42:50,037
Batmobile, but somehow he hit a button that
ejected the Batpod. It was just hilarious,

459
00:42:50,077 --> 00:42:53,499
especially when he hit the turbo button. And
basically, he was driving the motorcycle by

460
00:42:53,619 --> 00:42:58,843
barely hanging on to the handlebars. Yeah. All
while listening to little John sing All I Really

461
00:42:58,863 --> 00:43:03,565
Want for Christmas was freaking great. Now,
the burglars returned to their boss, the Joker.

462
00:43:03,926 --> 00:43:09,529
having lost all of the gifts that they had stolen
except for Damian's utility belt. The Joker

463
00:43:09,569 --> 00:43:15,132
reveals that he was responsible for tricking
Batman into leaving the city so that his henchmen

464
00:43:15,152 --> 00:43:21,036
could ruin Christmas. And after witnessing video
evidence of the chaos Damian was able to cause

465
00:43:21,136 --> 00:43:27,040
to his henchmen while dressed as a little Batman,
Joker recruits other villains to help Damian

466
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:32,642
cause destruction across the city. Meanwhile
Batman discovers Mr. Freeze was responsible

467
00:43:32,662 --> 00:43:38,024
for sabotaging his Batplane while trying to
fix it. Now it's never really made clear how

468
00:43:38,064 --> 00:43:42,945
Mr. Freeze was able to sabotage the Batplane.
There's a lot of instances in the film where

469
00:43:42,965 --> 00:43:48,667
I'm like, do the bad guys know that Batman is
Bruce Wayne? It's never really made clear.

470
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:53,729
Well you would think they would at least be
able to deduce it at this point when they realize

471
00:43:53,849 --> 00:43:58,999
that the kid from Wayne Manor is little Batman.
Well, I think Joker just thought it was a little

472
00:43:59,019 --> 00:44:04,385
kid in a bat costume. It's not until the very
end that Joker learns that Batman has a son

473
00:44:04,445 --> 00:44:08,168
and even makes a point of scolding Batman for
not telling him saying that, Hey, I thought

474
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:12,713
we were friends at that point. I think they
could have been able to deduce that Bruce Wayne

475
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:17,317
was Batman, especially at the very end in the
diner when Joker's having Christmas dinner

476
00:44:17,357 --> 00:44:24,050
with freaking Alfred. That's the big clue. That's
true. Determining Santa Claus would know where

477
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:30,092
his utility belt is, Damien visits Santa at
the mall only to discover Santa is the villain

478
00:44:30,132 --> 00:44:36,994
Bane in disguise. Ambushed by Bane and Poison
Ivy, Damien manages to accidentally bring down

479
00:44:37,034 --> 00:44:42,355
the city's giant Christmas tree, turning the
press and public sentiment against him, while

480
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:48,076
the Penguin manages to escape with the utility
belt. The Joker, thrilled with Damien's success,

481
00:44:48,257 --> 00:44:54,927
expresses a desire to meet and speak with Meanwhile,
Batman and Mr. Freeze face off in a blizzard

482
00:44:55,087 --> 00:44:59,930
in the Canadian wilderness, where Batman learns
that Damien is taking on Gotham's villains

483
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:06,213
as a little Batman. Isn't it strange that they
aged up the villains so drastically in this

484
00:45:06,253 --> 00:45:10,916
movie? They were all almost geriatric. Poison
Ivy had the white hair and the penguin was

485
00:45:11,036 --> 00:45:16,019
on a scooter and everything like that. I always
assumed that Batman's villains were roughly

486
00:45:16,039 --> 00:45:20,801
around the same age as Batman himself, but here
it appeared that they were like 20 to 30 years

487
00:45:20,901 --> 00:45:25,135
older. So this wasn't something I realized the
first time I watched the movie. I thought the

488
00:45:25,175 --> 00:45:31,017
white hair on Ivy was just a design choice and
the whole glasses thing on Bane's I thought

489
00:45:31,037 --> 00:45:35,699
that was just you know something that was left
over from him wearing the Santa Claus costume.

490
00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:42,462
Penguin has always been old in my opinion but
yeah I guess the characters were aged up to

491
00:45:42,482 --> 00:45:47,964
a point where I think it kind of almost justified
them retiring from supervillainy and that's

492
00:45:47,984 --> 00:45:53,423
why they were like outside of Arkham to begin
with. Yeah maybe. Damien and his Bat-Dad AI

493
00:45:53,463 --> 00:45:58,706
contemplate Bruce's relationship with his own
parents at the Gotham Zoo before falling into

494
00:45:58,746 --> 00:46:04,489
a trap set by the Penguin, who taunts Damien
with his utility belt. During a battle between

495
00:46:04,509 --> 00:46:10,752
the two, Penguin manages to damage the Bat-Dad
AI before attempting to flee on a giant balloon

496
00:46:10,912 --> 00:46:17,276
during a Christmas parade. While in freefall,
Bat-Dad sacrifices itself to save Damien's

497
00:46:17,336 --> 00:46:23,275
life by directing power to its inflation capability.
With Gotham City on fire from the ruined parade,

498
00:46:23,556 --> 00:46:28,539
Commissioner Gordon turns on the bat signal.
As Damien flees from the angry Gotham citizens,

499
00:46:28,639 --> 00:46:34,784
he has a panic attack, but is eventually discovered
by Alfred, who offers him some cocoa. Now the

500
00:46:34,844 --> 00:46:40,248
panic attack scene was kind of weird. It went
black and white and very grainy. It was kind

501
00:46:40,268 --> 00:46:45,792
of spooky. I initially thought this was the
result of Damien being exposed to Scarecrow,

502
00:46:46,132 --> 00:46:52,023
but that turned out to not be the case. I like
it for its artistic choice. Apparently an entirely

503
00:46:52,063 --> 00:46:57,987
different artist worked on this woodcutout style.
I think it was just meant to visually portray

504
00:46:58,027 --> 00:47:02,349
Damien in his darkest moment. Yeah it was kind
of dark. I'm glad it ended up being Alfred

505
00:47:02,489 --> 00:47:07,032
and not the Scarecrow because then things would
have gotten a lot scarier. Now Damien encounters

506
00:47:07,152 --> 00:47:12,975
a balloon with a card from the Joker asking
to meet. The card gases Damien and he wakes

507
00:47:13,075 --> 00:47:18,618
up at a candy factory where he finds Joker and
his allies celebrating Christmas. The villains

508
00:47:18,658 --> 00:47:24,221
congratulate Damian on helping them bring crime
back to Gotham. As the city was focused on

509
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:29,924
little Batman's destruction, they were able
to steal everyone's presence. As Damian languishes

510
00:47:30,024 --> 00:47:35,727
that he's become a villain, the villains present
him with his utility belt, now armed with dangerous,

511
00:47:35,947 --> 00:47:42,331
sharp, and explosive gear. Taking responsibility
for his actions, Damian throws his belt into

512
00:47:42,371 --> 00:47:47,193
the fireplace, blowing up the Joker's party
globe before taking on all of the villains,

513
00:47:47,454 --> 00:47:53,015
single-handedly. This was probably the most
important scene in that it's where Damien really

514
00:47:53,075 --> 00:47:58,277
came to take full responsibility for his actions
and sacrifice the one thing that he really

515
00:47:58,337 --> 00:48:03,318
loved which was his utility belt even now that
was equipped with all the things he originally

516
00:48:03,398 --> 00:48:07,259
wanted it to be equipped with. Yeah it was a
great moment of character growth. During the

517
00:48:07,299 --> 00:48:13,161
fight Batman comes to Damien's aid and together
they bring down the Joker and his allies. Though

518
00:48:13,201 --> 00:48:20,089
Batman is reluctant Damien improves himself
during the battle and is rewarded with Batman's

519
00:48:20,329 --> 00:48:26,915
own utility belt. One of my favorite scenes
in the movie for some reason was when the Batarangs

520
00:48:27,075 --> 00:48:32,259
miss the Joker and he forgets about it and then
he gets hit with them and that sets off his

521
00:48:32,399 --> 00:48:37,604
rocket launcher that creates this massive explosion
like way bigger than it should have been and

522
00:48:37,644 --> 00:48:42,588
he just like flies backwards in slow motion.
Again it's a scene that goes on for longer

523
00:48:42,608 --> 00:48:47,398
than it should but because of that There's just
a lot of humor in it. I found it quite funny.

524
00:48:47,878 --> 00:48:52,860
I thought it was really touching when Batman
saw Damien protecting him. And like Damien

525
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,221
was like, I'll protect you dad. And that moment
of realization where you could tell he was

526
00:48:56,241 --> 00:49:00,682
really proud of his son for the little hero
that he had become. It was just very touching.

527
00:49:01,102 --> 00:49:07,164
Yeah, honestly, all I've ever wanted my dad
to tell me was, wow, sweet ninja skills, son.

528
00:49:08,564 --> 00:49:12,625
I have yet to hear that. And so I think that's
why it was so touching when I heard it in this

529
00:49:12,705 --> 00:49:18,616
movie. There's still hope. Maybe. Now Batman,
Damien, and Alfred use the Bat Jet to return

530
00:49:18,756 --> 00:49:24,459
everything that the Joker and his allies stole,
flying across the city and dropping presents,

531
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:30,382
returning Christmas to Gotham City. When Damien
expresses pity over how the Joker simply expressed

532
00:49:30,462 --> 00:49:36,025
loneliness, they end up sharing Christmas dinner
with him at a local diner, to Batman's chagrin.

533
00:49:36,425 --> 00:49:41,548
And that's the end of the movie. I gotta say,
Gotham City is not Whoville. The citizens of

534
00:49:41,588 --> 00:49:48,328
Gotham are not Whovians. Because in the Grinch
movie, the Hoos of Whoville realized that it

535
00:49:48,348 --> 00:49:52,930
was more than just the physical gifts that made
Christmas, and it was the time spent together

536
00:49:53,211 --> 00:49:57,293
as friends and family. And, you know, they were
singing around that Christmas tree at the end

537
00:49:57,513 --> 00:50:03,336
of How the Grinch Stole Christmas. But the citizens
of Gotham were like depressed and down and

538
00:50:03,536 --> 00:50:09,600
really sad until the moment they got their presents
back. So somebody needs to teach Gotham City

539
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:14,370
the true meaning of Christmas or something.
That's that's fair. I didn't even realize that

540
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:21,256
until you said that. That's probably not the
best lesson. But yeah, I mean, I walked out

541
00:50:21,276 --> 00:50:26,140
of the movie theater just really happy with
this movie. And I don't know if it's just the

542
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:30,804
holiday season or whatever, but I just enjoyed
the heck out of it. Did you like the ending

543
00:50:30,844 --> 00:50:35,027
line, like the way it ended on the joke where
Batman just says, I'm not your friend, it was

544
00:50:35,047 --> 00:50:39,414
a little bit abrupt for my taste. I thought
it was fine. I mean, the music that came right

545
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:45,197
after that line, I thought helped sell the joke
a little bit and how abrupt it was. Yeah, it

546
00:50:45,217 --> 00:50:49,380
didn't bother me. I had fun with the film. It
was time worth spending, especially around

547
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,262
this Christmas season. You mentioned earlier
how a criticism of the film could be that it's

548
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:59,325
unoriginal because it borrows from so many other
holiday movies. But I actually like that about

549
00:50:59,365 --> 00:51:02,907
it, how it kind of plays like a greatest hits
of all these awesome Christmas moments from

550
00:51:02,987 --> 00:51:09,503
other media packaged in a cute little Batman
film. I agree with that, that's why I think

551
00:51:09,523 --> 00:51:14,927
it'll definitely come on at least on an annual
rotation in my household. But borrowing from

552
00:51:14,967 --> 00:51:20,371
nostalgic holiday classics, the film appeals
to adults and children alike thanks to its

553
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:26,236
charming visuals, fun action, and laugh out
loud humor. I thought the movie was immensely

554
00:51:26,296 --> 00:51:33,954
fun and funny, and I'm giving it 4 out of 5
stars a fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Yeah,

555
00:51:33,974 --> 00:51:38,215
I think four stars is a great rating. I actually
like this movie more than the Guardians of

556
00:51:38,235 --> 00:51:41,916
the Galaxy holiday special that we got last
year, which I believe I gave three and a half

557
00:51:41,956 --> 00:51:46,497
stars. I think if I remember correctly, my issue
with the Guardian special was that it didn't

558
00:51:46,697 --> 00:51:52,199
evoke those feelings that the best holiday specials
did, whereas Merry Little Batman, I think definitely

559
00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:56,280
does. Right. Yeah, I remember you saying that
and I would agree with that. Like we said at

560
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:02,810
the top of the episode, there aren't many holiday
focused films from Marvel or DC. Merry Little

561
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:08,832
Batman is obviously the most overt holiday project
for the two companies. So there wasn't much

562
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:14,414
competition in it being the best holiday project.
But yeah, it definitely is. But that does it

574
