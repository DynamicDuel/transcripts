00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,680
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi and welcome
to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,080
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:37,200
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe and I'm his twin

4
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:45,120
brother Johnny DC. And in this episode we are going
to review the very first DC Universe film,

5
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,220
Superman. Hell yeah we are, heck yeah we are. Calm
down, calm down. Right off the bat Jonathan,

6
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,840
you're gonna fucking annoy me this whole episode I
already know I just want to let you know that you

7
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,300
need to just be normal. I mean if we were reviewing
Iron Man for the first time would you be calm? I

8
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,820
would not but how dare you compare this movie to
Iron Man. Oh I'll compare it to Endgame. What did I

9
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,640
just say about annoying me? What did I just say?
We're gonna review the movie and talk all about

10
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,380
spoilers so hopefully you've seen the movie.
Before we do that we're gonna break down the latest

11
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:21,800
comic book movie news that came up this past week
which there was none. So really we're just gonna do

12
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,100
the upfront stuff and then get right into the
review. As always we list our segment times in our

with that out of the way, quick to the no prize. A no

26
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:27,680
prize is an award that Marvel used to give out to
fans. Our version, the Dynamic Dual No Prize is a

27
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,280
digital award that we've put on Instagram for the
person that we feel gave the best answer to our

28
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,600
question of the week. Last week we asked, for those
of you who have seen Superman in its opening

29
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,140
weekend, what did you think? Hey we got a few
answers so let's go ahead and run down our

30
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,760
honorable mentions as well as the no prize winner.
Our first honorable mention goes to Brandon

31
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,460
Estregard who said. Hey guys just wanted to say
congratulations to Team Marvel. You guys really

32
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:59,940
nailed it as the Reddit posting monkeys in the
movie. Roll Oscar worthy stuff. Great job guys. Oh

33
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:05,380
man you would not believe the casting process I had
to undergo for the role of the Reddit posting

34
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:10,960
monkeys. Man, I went full method with it and was
just hoping that that's what they would want from a

35
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:16,660
performance and luckily everything came through
and I got the role. I was the one that was posting

36
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,980
super shit in the movie. Let me guess you flung your
poo at the casting director. That's how I got the

37
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,840
role actually. Yeah, for those who are missing
context on what we're talking about in the

38
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,700
Superman movie this isn't too much of a spoiler.
Lex Luthor trained a bunch of monkeys to talk shit

39
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,780
about Superman on the internet. Which is
basically my full time job on our Discord server.

40
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,940
There were a lot of funny scenes in the Superman
movie and that has to be in the top five. I was

41
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:48,120
cracking up at the monkey scene. Thanks for the
answer Brandon. Our next honorable mention goes

42
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:55,340
to Alex Albro. Who said? Hey guys, I thought it was
great. Rated at 9.5. My wife rated at 8. Just really

43
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:00,280
good Superman show. I'm excited to see where they
go with the Hall of Justice and the Justice Gang or

44
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,800
Justice League or whatever they end up being. We
really liked them. Mr. Terrific was great. I think

45
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,140
Nicholas Holt really stole the show. It was Lex
Luthor for me and I'm just excited to see where it

46
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:15,060
goes. It was a nice surprise to see Millie Alcock as
Supergirl at the end and Crypto was great and

47
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:20,920
overall just a good way to end the weekend. Thanks
guys. Okay, that is actually a spoiler but if

48
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:24,940
you're on social media it's already been spoiled
for you. There's been news articles about

49
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,200
Supergirl showing up and yeah, her cameo did not
disappoint. I totally agree with Alex, Lex

50
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:36,840
Luthor, Mr. Terrific, the Justice Gang. All of it
was great as I will expand upon in our review. Let's

51
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,200
see, Alex gave it a 9.5 out of 10 which on a five star
scale equates to four and three quarter stars.

52
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:50,080
Let's see what Matt from Texas rated it. Hey guys,
Matt from Texas here. Superman 4 out of 5 was a great

53
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:58,020
film. It had a little bit of issues, camera angles,
some pacing, stuff like that, mostly minor but all

54
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:05,720
the actors did really well. David Cornswet as
Superman was fantastic. This is what Superman is.

55
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:13,220
Colorful, helps everybody, you know, does the
right thing. He is a Boy Scout and that's exactly

56
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:18,100
what he portrayed in this film. Yeah, Superman
needs to be redefined for a new generation every

57
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,760
once in a while. I'm not quite sure that Henry
Cavill find the character of Superman back in the

58
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,000
20's in the same way that Cornswet has now defined
the character for modern times. Yeah, he did a

59
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,000
fantastic job. Although as Matt says the movie's
not perfect, there are issues but they are minor, I

60
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,660
would agree. So great answer Matt. We want to give a
quick shout out to CJ Kraft for taking the time to

61
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:47,540
visit our website and record an answer but the
winner of this week's No Price is Scott Camacho and

62
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:55,440
his daughter Rena. Who said? Hi, I'm Scotty Macho.
Hi, I'm Rena Macho. And we are? The Machos. We just

63
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,780
watched the Superman movie. That's how you do a
Superman movie. That was awesome. I don't care

64
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:06,110
about his outfit though, I still don't like his
outfit but that is how you do a Superman movie.

65
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:13,080
Rena, what did Supergirl say? I'm thankful for
watching my dog bitch. Oh my gosh. Yeah, again that

66
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,820
Supergirl scene was great. I've seen a lot of flak
for it online because I think a lot of people

67
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:22,980
haven't read Supergirl Woman of Tomorrow but it
was straight from that comic. Yeah, it's

68
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:27,980
definitely a unique take on the character who's
typically portrayed as similar to her cousin in

69
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,780
terms of demeanor and stuff like that. So yeah,
Millie Elcock's Supergirl is probably at a left

70
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:37,540
field for a lot of people. Honestly, the whole
reason we gave this no prize win to Scott and Rena is

71
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,020
because it was hilarious. Jonathan, how old were
your daughters when you heard them say their first

72
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:48,440
curse word? I think my younger daughter Faith once
said piss not realizing it was a bad word. I can't

73
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:54,220
remember how old she was though. Is piss a bad word?
I think so. I told her not to say it again. I'm

74
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:59,000
horrified that my two-year-old any day now is
going to start saying fuck out of the blue because I

75
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,180
say it way too much in front of her. Yeah, you have
this podcast running in the background and all of a

76
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:12,880
sudden fuck DC. I'd be so proud. I'd be so proud. For
a great answer, Scotty and Rena, you guys win this

77
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,700
week's no prize. If you, the listener, want to
shout out winning your own no prize, stay tuned to

78
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,560
later on this episode when we'll be asking another
question of the week. And now that that's done,

79
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:30,400
onto the question of the week. What the high
praises that most audience members seem to be

80
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,799
giving Superman, the odds of it getting a sequel
are really high. So with that in mind, what do you

81
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:42,539
want the sequel to the Superman movie to be about?
Yeah, what do you want the story to be about? What

82
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:46,920
characters do you want to see in it? Who do you want
the villain to be? Let us know. Record your answer

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:16,560
to answer before July 18th. But let's go ahead and
get into the main event of this episode where we

88
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:39,220
reviewed DC Studios first feature length film,
Superman. OK, Superman, written and directed by

89
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:45,280
DC Studios head James Gunn, is the first
theatrical film to be released under the DC

90
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:54,020
Studios banner, as well as the first film to be set
in DC's new cinematic universe known as the DCU. A

91
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:59,220
gun was hired by Warner Brothers to launch a new DC
cinematic universe after the prior one

92
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:05,280
established in 2013's Man of Steel failed to match
the box office success of the rival Marvel

93
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:10,940
Studios. Despite Gunn's prior success writing
and directing Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy

94
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:17,760
franchise, as well as DC's The Suicide Squad and
Peacemaker Projects, I was initially conflicted

95
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,140
when I learned that he was writing and directing
the first film in DC's new cinematic universe

96
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:28,100
because I wasn't sure his raunchy yet heartfelt
comedic style of filmmaking would work for a

97
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:35,260
character like Superman. A notoriously raunchy
character. What? No. Now, with each new trailer

98
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:40,380
that was released for this film, my expectations
grew to the point where I was actually a little

99
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:46,580
depressed that Superman wasn't going to be able to
live up to my expectations. But to my surprise, the

100
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:52,240
film hit my expectations dead center. And I'm
actually proud of this new start to DC's cinematic

101
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,420
universe. I'm still thinking about the film days
after seeing it. And for anyone interested in

102
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:03,760
seeing the movie that hasn't already, be aware
that this is a spoiler review. So you should stop

103
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,340
listening now so you could go into the movie fresh.
Yeah, I feel like there's too many people out there

104
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:12,760
who are willing to spoil themselves, just
claiming that it doesn't affect them. But you are

105
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,440
doing yourself a disservice, whether you admit to
it or not. Seeing something unfold on the big

106
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,680
screen for the first time without prior knowledge
is absolutely the best way to experience these

107
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:28,780
stories. Yes, totally an experience, especially
this film on the IMAX screen. It was incredible. I

108
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:33,960
saw it on a really big screen on a RPX theater. And I
wasn't aware at the time that I had actually

109
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,880
purchased RPX tickets. So I walk into the
auditorium and I'm sitting way too fucking close

110
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,140
to the screen. That's all I thought. I was like, God
damn, this screen is too big. I'm going to have to

111
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:50,120
like lean back in my chair to really enjoy this. But
did you enjoy it? The movie overall? Yeah, I did.

112
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:56,240
Yeah, I think I have a few gripes with it, but they
are largely nitpicky bullshit that had more to do

113
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:02,100
with my own subjective feelings about world
building and traditional story structures and

114
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,440
anything really substantial. OK, I could see that
and we'll get into that later. But I actually think

115
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,700
that this is James Gunn's best superhero film yet,
or at least his most mature, because here he was

116
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:21,520
focused on reimagining characters through his
usual quirky lens. He instead set out to show how

117
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:29,000
radical true righteousness and unconditional
kindness can be in a world of moral relativism. The

118
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,740
film's whole thesis is that in a cynical,
distrustful society, simply choosing to trust

119
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:41,080
and see the good in others becomes the ultimate act
of rebellion. And with that simple, yet profound

120
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:47,620
idea, Gunn somehow made Superman cooler than he's
been in maybe a century. And it just transformed

121
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:53,900
him for this film into a countercultural icon
while staying true to his spirit. It turns out that

122
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:59,360
you don't need to reinvent a classic character to
fit the current zeitgeist. You just need society

123
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,840
to shift enough that the forgotten philosophies
of the past feel bold and new again, no neck

124
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:10,660
snapping required. I agree with you partly in
that, yeah, being kind is cool, but I'm not going to

125
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:16,720
say that Superman is countercultural. I wouldn't
go that far. I would say more so in this film than he

126
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:23,000
has maybe ever been. Because you think society at
the current moment is so cynical that this type of

127
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,540
thinking is radical. I think radical is a strong
word. I'm sorry, are you not on social media? Do not

128
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:34,560
look at comments. I think it's radical. I think
it's more appreciated now, more than ever. I think

129
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,180
this was a better way to adapt the character for
modern times than the whole dark and serious

130
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:44,640
approach that Zack Snyder took. That's totally
valid. Yeah. Now, I loved Man of Steel and I've been

131
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:50,200
a staunch defender of its sci-fi approach to the
Superman lore. But if I'm being honest, after

132
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,140
seeing Superman and its more faithful
interpretation of the character, it makes Man of

133
00:13:55,140 --> 00:14:00,620
Steel feel somewhat like an Elseworld tale, like
still interesting. But definitely a departure

134
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:06,100
from who the character actually is. And that's not
to say that this depiction of Superman was

135
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:12,800
perfect. He's much more pouty and easily agitated
in this film than he is in, say, the comics. But the

136
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:20,240
fact that he would go out of his way to save babies
and dogs and even squirrels is in sharp contrast to

137
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,420
the criticisms of apathy leveled at the Zack
Snyder's take on the character. Right. Apathy,

138
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:31,320
because we saw Metropolis essentially destroyed
at the nuclear level in the Man of Steel movie

139
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:37,320
without seeing Superman handle a lot of the
civilian saving duties of his role. Right. The Man

140
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,640
of Steel version of Superman is very much an
objectivist take, which focuses on the self and

141
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,760
selfishness, which is why you had, you know, pot
can't say, OK, maybe you don't save those kids. And

142
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,940
while you had my can't saying, you don't owe anyone
anything. This take on Superman is very much at

143
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:58,100
odds with that. And it was pretty refreshing. Now,
where I work, we have a saying that we shouldn't

144
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:04,380
make perfect the enemy of good. And I largely feel
that way about James Gunn's approach to Superman,

145
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:10,280
which was a really good interpretation. What was
perfect, however, in my opinion, were his takes on

146
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:17,860
Superman's supporting cast, particularly Lex
Luthor. Now, Lex has never been done right on film.

147
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,740
He was always supposed to be a mad scientist type
character that could invent challenges for

148
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:28,620
Superman that were essentially unfathomable for
anyone else. Portrayals from Gene Hackman or

149
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:34,520
Kevin Spacey lacked the scientist aspect of the
character, while Jesse Eisenbergs was a little

150
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:41,220
too mad, even getting comparisons to the Joker.
But Gunn's version not only involved a real estate

151
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:47,060
scheme, but also incorporated nanites, cloning,
international politics and even a freaking

152
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:54,100
pocket universe. There is so much Silver Age ask
shenanigans going on here. And it was really cool

153
00:15:54,100 --> 00:16:00,540
to see how unapologetically Gunn showcased his
love for that era of comics. Yeah, the film's plot

154
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,940
at times got a little bit bonkers. And a lot of that
has to do with Lex's pocket dimension

155
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:11,160
shenanigans. They took the story places that I
didn't think they were going to go literally. Oh,

156
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,980
yeah. Like, for example, the trash talking
monkeys that we talked about earlier. Yeah, once

157
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:20,760
you go to trash talking monkeys online, you could
go literally anywhere. There were just these

158
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:26,800
really idiosyncratic ideas that are a trademark
of James Gunn's that I wasn't quite sure fit in the

159
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,960
realm of Superman as much as, like, say, Guardians
of the Galaxy or something like that. But it was

160
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,480
nice that Gunn was able to put his stamp on the
project in that way, because it did feel very

161
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,000
Silver Age and therefore did communicate a love
for the very comic booky version of Superman,

162
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,540
which is something that we haven't really seen
from the character on the big screen. And it's

163
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,480
pretty fun. There's a lot of fun to be had with
Superman that we haven't gotten in a long time. I

164
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,820
was actually surprised by how much fun I had
actually, because typically I like a serious

165
00:16:54,820 --> 00:17:00,980
approach to my superhero films. I don't like it
when it gets goofball. And while this went

166
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:07,920
interesting places like you mentioned bonkers,
it never felt goofy to me. You know, between it felt

167
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:14,260
at times a little bit goofy. What? When? With
crypto? Oh, I'm sorry. What do you have against

168
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:19,060
crypto? I'm going to state right off the bat. I
don't like crypto. I thought he was annoying in

169
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:25,180
this movie. Every time he was not on the screen, I
was relieved. Crypto was a total scene stealer

170
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:31,180
that everyone loved. You are on the wrong side of
history. Die your head in shame. I think crypto is a

171
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:36,740
scene stealer, but in the wrong way. No, dude, I
loved crypto. Like, I actually have no notes on

172
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:42,220
crypto in my review. I just loved him. He was too
chaotic. And every time he was brought into the

173
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,760
story yet, it kind of detracted, I think, from the
pot. No, there were times where he felt a little bit

174
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,620
deus ex machina e. And overall, the concept was
just goofy. I think actually the film would have

175
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:55,880
been better if he wasn't included. I don't think he
was entirely necessary. I think he was included

176
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,740
just for merchandising or something. I don't know
to add a cute element to the movie. I could actually

177
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:08,020
see that, especially with the mid credit scene how
it left off with like this super, super cute moment

178
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:13,560
between Superman and crypto, just having
probably a majority of audiences leave with that

179
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,740
final moment, I think was perhaps a little
manipulative. And maybe his appearance in the

180
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:24,020
film overall is a little manipulative. But I was
totally sold on it. Crypto was one of my favorite

181
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,760
aspects of this movie. And I totally couldn't see
it being as successful without him. I definitely

182
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,480
could. Well, you don't know what the hell you're
talking about, you dog hater. I love dogs. I have a

183
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:42,720
dog. I love my dog. I love this dog. Fuck this guy.
But I don't love crypto. He's kind of a dickhead and

184
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,800
I'm not ashamed to say it. Hey, bad dogs deserve
love, too, bro. Not bad dogs who are also just made

185
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:53,740
out of pixels. I don't care about them. No, crypto
felt real to me. I didn't feel like he was made of

186
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:58,080
pixels. I thought they did a really good job with
this CG. And actually, the CG throughout the whole

187
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:03,580
film, I thought, was a lot better than I've seen in a
lot of films as of late. Every time those crypto

188
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:08,220
pixels appeared on the screen, I just wanted to
kick them right out of the movie. The hell is wrong

189
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:13,680
with you? Now, between Lex Luthor's hijinks and
the powers of Mr. Terrific Guy Gardner and

190
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:19,860
Metamorpho and I guess crypto, there are some deep
cuts in this film that we've never seen on the big

191
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:26,140
screen before. And the fact that Gunn wasted no
time explaining any of it, literally starting

192
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:31,340
this universe three years into Superman's
career, but still having audiences beyond board

193
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:37,740
with the film, I think is a testament not only to how
strong of a filmmaker James Gunn is and to his level

194
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:44,460
of respect for the audience, but also to how much of
a cultural icon Superman is still to this day.

195
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,640
Absolutely, yeah. I mean, Superman needs no
introduction. Everybody already knows him,

196
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,900
which is probably why James Gunn was able to put
audiences in the deep end in this new DC universe

197
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:59,360
that he created. It's one of the more unsatisfying
aspects of the film, though, in my mind. Superman

198
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:07,220
is like if the Avengers movie was the very first MCU
film in that it would still be good and enjoyable,

199
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:13,340
but it lacks the foundation that prior world
building films would have set up. The most world

200
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:19,440
building we got for this new DC universe were like
six lines of text at the very beginning of the film

201
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,120
that is basically saying many humans have been
around for a while. Superman introduced himself

202
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:28,440
to the world like three years ago. Let's get the
story started. I actually thought that was a

203
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,420
brilliant piece of world building. It was almost
like Star Wars ask the way you were kind of thrown

204
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:38,760
into that universe with just the opening crawl.
Yeah, I mean, I can't knock this approach too much

205
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,440
because I understand why James Gunn did it. No one
wants to see Superman's origin again because

206
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,960
we've seen it a lot. Whether it was in the Donner
film or the Man of Steel film, everybody knows that

207
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,500
Superman was a baby who was sent from Krypton. And
we even got references to that in this movie. So his

208
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:59,420
backstory is essentially established. I guess
what felt hollow to me were like the other

209
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:04,860
supporting metahumans that just kind of exist in
this world without a whole lot of setup. In a

210
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,600
perfect world, each of these characters would
have had the chance to live and breathe on their

211
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,220
own. But again, I understand, you know, how many
different superhero films have come out in the

212
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:18,220
past couple of decades? We're at the point now
where you can drop people in the deep end and they

213
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:22,120
won't feel like they're drowning because they
understand what these movies are about and

214
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,720
largely who these characters already are. I agree
and I could see where you're coming from, although

215
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,680
I would argue wouldn't that mean that characters
like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Han Solo and Darth Vader

216
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:38,460
would have also needed some project that you would
have seen them in prior to Star Wars? Yes and no. And

217
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,940
I'm trying to articulate what felt slightly
unsatisfying about the film. I think the reason

218
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:48,400
characters like Obi-Wan Kenobi and Han Solo
worked in a movie like A New Hope where you're

219
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,440
dropped into this world and introduced to these
characters largely without context is because a

220
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,500
movie like A New Hope followed a very traditional
storytelling structure wherein being

221
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:05,620
introduced to the characters at the point they
enter the script felt organic and you didn't feel

222
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,680
like you were missing context because you were
still being introduced to the world. Here in the

223
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,500
Superman movie, the storytelling structure is
not traditional. There is no three act structure

224
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:19,360
here. It feels very episodic. It feels very much
like a comic book series. That's to its credit and

225
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,240
to its detriment, I think. When I say to its credit,
I mean because the plot of the film is very much

226
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:29,200
unlike what audiences are used to seeing from
these stories on the screen. And therefore it

227
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,860
feels new and unique. When I say the structures to
its detriment is because it makes the story feel a

228
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:38,780
little off in general. I could see that, you know,
with the amount of stuff thrown at Superman in this

229
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:44,980
movie. The film felt longer to me than it actually
was, though not at all in a bad way. Like, I was

230
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:50,660
surprised that this movie was only about two hours
long when so much happened in the film. The film's

231
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:55,960
pacing definitely moves forward at a steady clip,
particularly in its second half, where it

232
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,340
seemingly feels like there's climax after climax
after climax. It's like, what? Superman's about

233
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:06,660
to fall into a black hole. What? Bravian and Jarhan
Perr are going to war. What? Metropolis is being

234
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:11,420
torn in half. What? There's Kryptonite. What?
He's joining in that night. What? There's a clone

235
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:17,500
in much the same way that Batman was very
reactionary to the Joker in The Dark Knight or the

236
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:23,480
Riddler in The Batman. The ultimate stakes set up
by the film's antagonist aren't revealed to the

237
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:29,200
hero until after their plans have already been set
in motion. So there's no telling just how far the

238
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:35,780
villain is willing to take things for the hero or
the audience. Typically in a three act structure,

239
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:40,580
audiences are made aware of the ultimate stakes of
the film between the end of the first act in the

240
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,300
middle of the film. You know, that's when we see
Alderaan blow up. That's when we learn what the

241
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:50,480
matrix is. That's when Frodo is straight up
stabbed and nearly killed. But the primary

242
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,800
conflict of this film seems to be will Superman
embrace his Kryptonian destiny or remain true to

243
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:02,520
his humanity rather than will Metropolis be
destroyed and actually thought that was a

244
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:07,020
fascinating approach. But speaking of
characterizations, let's move into our

245
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:13,400
character breakdown. Starting with Superman
slash Clark Kent, who was played by David Corrent

246
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:21,920
sweat. Now, his performance is extremely sincere
and extremely likeable. I mentioned in our review

247
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:27,220
of The Batman that Robert Pattinson brought more
interest to the character of Bruce Wayne than any

248
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:32,780
actor before him. And I'd say the same for Corrent
sweat. Again, I'd say the characterization isn't

249
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:39,440
necessarily perfect. My ideal Superman
personally is actually pretty stoic. But I do see

250
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,540
the appeal in Corrent sweat's performance, who
definitely puts the man in Superman more than

251
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:50,720
anyone before him on the big screen. He's
definitely a more humanized character than like

252
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:57,040
Henry Cavill, right? You talk a lot about the
appeal of DC comic books over Marvel in that DC

253
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:03,260
comics are a lot more iconic and more legend like
than Marvel comic books, whose characters are a

254
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:09,000
lot more relatable. Given that I feel like this
version of Superman in this movie is more Marvel

255
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,980
like than any previous adaptation of the
character. How do you feel about that? You know, it

256
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:19,040
is what it is. I wouldn't disagree with you. It's
again, not necessarily my favorite version of how

257
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:24,500
the character is portrayed because, you know, I
don't necessarily need my mythical characters

258
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:30,720
like Hercules, for example, to have so much of a
personality. But it doesn't hurt as long as they

259
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:37,220
stay true to the essence of the character, which I
100 percent believe they did in this film. I'll let

260
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:46,800
it slide. You closet Marvel fan. What? No, I knew
it. No way. Now, Superman begins the film as this

261
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:53,080
embodiment of unwavering optimism. A figure so
committed to seeing the good in others and

262
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,640
protecting life that it strains his relationship
with the American public and even his

263
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:03,300
relationship with Lois Lane, when Lois
essentially accuses him of being naive, pointing

264
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:09,120
out that while she questions everyone and
everything, he's eager to trust and see beauty in

265
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:15,800
everyone he meets. His reply that may be trust and
kindness are the real punk rock reveals the moral

266
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:22,160
steadfastness at the heart of his character.
Clark's unwavering faith in humanity isn't just

267
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,840
his greatest strength. It's what makes him
potentially more human than anyone else. I think

268
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:33,880
the scene that this clicked the most for me was when
he was in Lois's apartment and the Justice Gang

269
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,480
were fighting. I think that was Mixed Spitalik in
the background. Yeah, weird, huh? Superman

270
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:44,100
called him a dimensional imp. But that was a great
scene as far as characterization goes. And when he

271
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:50,300
says that he's going to turn himself in knowingly
going into a trap for the sake of this dog, who he

272
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:55,160
doesn't even particularly like just because it's
the right thing to do, says a lot about his

273
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,920
character. And Lois realized that. And that's
when she planted a big old smooch on him just for

274
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:04,860
being a good guy. Yeah, that was a fantastic scene.
I loved that scene. Although I thought it was in

275
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:11,180
Clark's apartment, not Lois's. Was it? I don't
know. Now, Superman's moral foundation was

276
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:16,340
shaken to its core when he learned what the full
message from his Kryptonian parents was,

277
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:21,860
essentially that they intended him to dominate
and repopulate Earth rather than uplift it.

278
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:28,280
Reeling from this seeming betrayal, Clark
confronts a painful question of identity. Is he

279
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:34,200
the benevolent protector he always believed he
was? Or is he a harbinger of conquest? In a tender

280
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:40,320
moment with Jonathan Kent, his adoptive father,
he's reminded that his actions, not his origins,

281
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,760
define him and its Clark's choices, his failures
and the courage to keep stepping forward, despite

282
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:52,920
those failures, that shape who he truly is. By the
end of the film, as he faces Lex Luthor and is called

283
00:27:52,920 --> 00:28:00,360
an alien, Clark delivers the gist, essentially of
his arc, that his humanity, along with Lex's and

284
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:06,200
everyone else's, is everyone's greatest
strength when they're able to recognize that

285
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:11,900
humanity in each other. Yeah, it's so fantastic.
Such a fantastic message. I freaking loved it. I

286
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:18,020
freaking loved this movie. What do you think,
though, about the alleged message from Jor-El and

287
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:23,840
Lara about Superman's purpose being the
domination of planet Earth? That was a twist. I did

288
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,820
not see that coming. That was actually really
interesting. And I don't mind it, honestly. Like,

289
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:34,680
it's definitely a deviation from what we know
about the characters in the comics, and it's

290
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,760
almost kind of sacrilegious in that way. Yeah, my
head cannon is that Lex is lying. And no matter how

291
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:44,500
many times they keep saying in the movie that it's
the true translation, I don't really buy it

292
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:51,100
because it's so perfectly fit Lex's agenda. That
could be the case. And I love that the movie kind of

293
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:57,240
leaves it up to interpretation. For anyone upset
by the implication, you have to remember that this

294
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:03,520
is coming from Lex Luthor, who's not a trustworthy
source, especially when he could easily create

295
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,360
new video footage with the engineer. Now, through
his journey, Superman doesn't just save the

296
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:17,560
world. He reclaims his place within it, embodying
a radical kind of hope. His arc is a reminder that

297
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:23,020
being human isn't about where you come from, but
about choosing kindness and having courage.

298
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:29,780
Again, fantastic arc, fantastic angle for the
character. And I'm really glad that James Gunn was

299
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:35,280
smart enough to kick off this cinematic universe
with this approach for Superman. Now, what did you

300
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:41,040
think about the suit? Well, as listeners know from
this podcast, when the suit was first revealed, I

301
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,960
didn't really like it. I've been largely
ambivalent since I don't like the texture of the

302
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,980
suit. I don't love the design. That being said, it
hardly registered with me in the course of the

303
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:55,720
film. I don't hate it. It definitely grew on me as
well, I would say. I was thrilled about it at the

304
00:29:55,720 --> 00:30:01,160
beginning, but this has kind of become, I would
say, my favorite Superman outfit, even though I

305
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:06,380
would have preferred something with a more
traditional logo just to put a more iconic stamp on

306
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:11,460
the suit. I think it really worked for this movie.
The best Superman suit is the one from Superman and

307
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:18,420
Lois, the TV show. Maybe. Again, I don't need like
the abs. Why do I need to see your abs, you know? To

308
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:23,520
make me feel bad, is that what you're trying to do?
So he can communicate that he could kick your ass

309
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,140
without having to say it out loud. I mean, I feel
like the symbol on the chest should do that. But you

310
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:34,820
see Superman's abs in the comic books. I don't
necessarily think you need to. All right. Moving

311
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,980
on to Lois Lane, she was played by Rachel
Brosnahan. Now I called it from the very

312
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:47,340
beginning. She was going to be the most perfect
Lois Lane to date on screen. And I was right. She

313
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:52,540
freaking nailed it. I loved her
characterization. I loved her performance.

314
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:57,800
Mwah, Chef's kiss. Yeah, she was fantastic. She
was definitely more like the comic book character

315
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:03,420
of Lois Lane than any other iteration I think we've
seen on the big screen thus far. Yeah, 100 percent.

316
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:09,360
She was true to character as the ultimate skeptic
that she is. She's this sharp, relentless,

317
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,360
investigative journalist who questions
everything and everyone, including the man she

318
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:19,720
loves. After Superman's controversial
intervention in Baravia, she openly questions

319
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:26,100
not just the ethics of his actions, but the very
foundation of their relationship. For Lois,

320
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:32,300
trust is earned, never given blindly. Her
instinct is to push back against power, even when

321
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:37,500
that power belongs to Superman. And that makes her
a really strong and independent character, which

322
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:43,360
she's always been in the comics. Yet, despite her
doubts in this film, she alone refuses to believe

323
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,720
Superman has any hidden agenda to repopulate
Earth with Kryptonians because she knows and

324
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,700
trusts Clark in a way that no one else does.
Throughout the film, Lois' arc is about

325
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:00,640
confronting her own fear of vulnerability and
learning to see the humanity beneath Superman's

326
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,140
invincibility. By the end, she realizes that
beneath the cape is the same man who had a mighty

327
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:11,880
crab joist poster in a smallville bedroom, a man
whose open heart and unwavering faith in others

328
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,560
aren't weaknesses, but proof of his shared
humanity. And choosing to stand by him and profess

329
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:23,620
her love, she overcomes her fears, embracing the
idea that love, despite all the differences and

330
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:29,360
uncertainties, is worth it. The character of Lois
Lane is usually portrayed as a damsel in distress

331
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:36,140
in her history in comic books and film, which never
quite sat well with me because she has such agency

332
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:42,260
as a character and is really smart or supposed to
be, you know. And I really like how this film chose

333
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:48,720
to use that agency and that intelligence to have
her go and seek out resources and help save

334
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,300
Superman. Right, exactly. They definitely do not
go with the traditional version of Lois Lane that

335
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:59,700
needs to be saved. She's the one that does the
saving in this film, which is fantastic and maybe

336
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:04,520
different from what we're used to seeing with the
character. But I never once for a second thought

337
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,040
that this version was not true to character
because of that. What did you think of the romance

338
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:14,000
between the characters of Lois and Superman here?
They definitely went a different route in that

339
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,220
Lois is in the dark on Superman's alter ego. So I
like the fact that right off the bat, they know who

340
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:25,600
each other are. And really, there shouldn't be a
long period of time between Lois's discovery of

341
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,880
Clark Kent being Superman because of how smart she
is and how inquisitive she is. But that doesn't

342
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:36,480
mean that they're automatically like head over
heels and love with each other. I actually thought

343
00:33:36,480 --> 00:34:12,199
it was really interesting that Lois Lane would not
be sure And yeah, she probably believed Superman

344
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:17,820
to be naive, but she also found the good guy
qualities about him to be endearing because they

345
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,900
had the strength of character and the strength in
general to boot. And she understood that kindness

346
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:27,639
is not weakness. Yeah, especially when you're as
strong as Superman. Moving on to Lex Luthor, he was

347
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:34,159
played by Nicholas Holt. Like Brosnahan, I
thought Holt's performance as Lex is the best to

348
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:41,000
date. His pettiness and overall emotionality
makes more sense to me than it does for someone like

349
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:48,120
Superman because Lex, as the film explicitly
says, is essentially the embodiment of envy. And I

350
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:54,179
have suspect that Holt's performance was so good
because he actually auditioned for the role of

351
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:59,520
Superman in this film, but lost the role to
Corenswet. Oh, for sure. He can easily identify

352
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,540
with Lex's envy in that way. That's a great point.
And I really like how this movie brought about the

353
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:11,100
theme of envy for Lex and the idea that he admitted
to it and leaned into that was kind of profound for

354
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:16,040
the character I felt. Yeah, absolutely. Like he's
intelligent enough to recognize his own faults in

355
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:21,940
a way, but also justify them. It's interesting.
Now, this film, Lex orchestrates this complex

356
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:28,480
array of schemes that includes cloning Superman
into Ultraman, manipulating global politics by

357
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,380
arming Baravia, inciting war for profit,
creating a pocket universe prison, engineering

358
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:40,780
villains, and even fostering public distrust
against Superman. His schemes are part

359
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:47,720
selfishness, part pettiness, and they reflect
his dual nature of his unparalleled genius yet

360
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:55,760
deep rooted in security. Lex's motivation in the
film explicitly is pure undiluted envy. He admits

361
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:01,860
that envy consumes him and that he cannot stomach
humanity's idolization of Superman because it

362
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:08,420
highlights humanity's collective weakness and
his own perceived undeserved inadequacy. His

363
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:15,280
rage isn't just about hating Superman. It's about
proving that humanity doesn't need gods or

364
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:22,400
saviors, that human intellect and willpower such
as his alone should define the future. Through his

365
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,900
obsession, Lex becomes something of a tragic
figure, a genius so terrified of his own

366
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:34,440
insignificance that he would rather destroy the
world than see it uplifted by an alien and foreign

367
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:40,540
ideal. He's a profound character that nothing
nailed him in this movie. Absolutely. And

368
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,840
admitting his whole weakness of envy thing,
because of that self-interestpection, he was

369
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:50,440
able to dive deeper into the why of his being and the
whole philosophy behind that, which I think is

370
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,000
incredibly profound when a character can speak to
their own truth like that. Oh, totally. I feel like

371
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,540
it came away from this film understanding Lex in a
way that I never really have before. A lot of the

372
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:05,500
characters even, including Superman. Yeah,
there's a lot of characters in this film. I just

373
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:11,100
wanted to touch on those three specifically, but
the roster is huge, including Jimmy Olsen, who was

374
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:18,300
played by Skyler Gizondo, who I thought nailed the
character, even though his depiction as a pussy

375
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:24,780
magnet. That exactly was, I think, unique to the
character, but I thought it worked really well for

376
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:31,200
this story. It was funny. He was one of many Daily
Planet cast members. Not all of them worked, I

377
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,960
felt. I felt they were largely background noise.
Yeah, really the only one that stood out to me was

378
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:43,120
Beck Bennett as Steve Lombard, but even with him,
I'm not sure why he was included in Mr. Terrific's

379
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:48,800
hovercraft towards the end, or really any of the
other Daily Planet staff other than Perry White,

380
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,400
Jimmy Olsen, and Lois Lane. I don't want to say the
cast was overstuffed, but there were definitely

381
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:58,720
some superfluous characters. For sure. Of
course, there was also the roster of the Justice

382
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,860
Gang, which I don't love the name of Justice Gang,
I'll be honest. I think it eventually will be

383
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:10,940
Justice League, just based on trailers from
Peacemaker Season 2. But if it were up to me, I would

384
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:16,480
actually prefer Maxwell Lord's team to sort of
segue into a Justice Society. I don't understand

385
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,720
why they wouldn't just call them the Justice
League to begin with. Like, why circumvent the

386
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:24,740
formation of the Justice League in this way? I
don't know if that has to do with the fact that

387
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:29,400
Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman are not
involved in it, or maybe the fact that they're

388
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,600
being somewhat indecisive this early on in the
universe, as to whether they want it to be the

389
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:40,720
Justice League or Justice Society. Who knows, I
did not care for it though. I'm on Team Hawk Girl in

390
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:46,180
that instance. Except Hawk Girl kind of sucked in
this movie, played by Isabella Merced. Yeah, I did

391
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:52,060
not like her characterization at all. Way too much
screaming for no reason. She didn't do nearly

392
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:57,660
enough damage to the kaiju with her mace. She
basically just tapped the fucking thing. And I was

393
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:03,360
like, okay. You think hitting it in the eyeball
with that mace would hurt it? But yeah, she didn't

394
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:08,420
do anything. Hawk Girl doesn't scream in the comic
books, so like she's not Black Canary, right? She

395
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:13,900
does, and I've actually seen some instances where
she does have a canary cry, but I feel like that's

396
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:18,640
just bad writing. Because yeah, she
traditionally does not have that. And it's not

397
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,260
like it did anything anyway in this movie. Her
enthematal mace should have knocked out the

398
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:28,440
kaiju's eye. I'm just gonna say it, but it didn't.
Yeah, I had real problems with Hawk Girl.

399
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,900
Hopefully she redeems herself in Peacemaker.
We'll see. I did love the other members of the

400
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:39,600
Justice Gang though, namely Guy Gardner, the
Green Lantern, played by Nathan Fillion. He

401
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:45,160
friggin killed it. Guy Gardner is not my favorite
Green Lantern, as I've mentioned in prior

402
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:52,260
episodes, but I thought he was perfect for this
movie because he was just a great foil in a way for a

403
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:57,900
Superman. Like he represented the cynicism of the
world. Yes, exactly. But I also liked the fact that

404
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:03,980
each character, including Guy Gardner, was able
to showcase their power in this really impressive

405
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:08,940
way. Like Hawk Girl was really the only one who
didn't get the opportunity to do that. But the most

406
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:15,000
impressive was actually Mr. Terrific, in my
opinion, played by Eddie Gathage. His moment

407
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,880
where he's taking on the soldiers at Fort Cramer
with his T-Spheres was so cool. One of the best

408
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:27,880
action scenes in the movie, I would say. I do like
how they showcased his multitasking ability in

409
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,760
the course of that fight, in that it felt like he was
kind of everywhere at once fighting everybody

410
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,120
through his T-Spheres. I like the T-Spheres in
general. I want the T-Spheres. I guess it was maybe

411
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,720
a little bit vague exactly what they did, at least
to newcomers, but I think people would be

412
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:48,200
impressed nonetheless. I mean, in the comics,
they kind of do everything. So it was appropriate.

413
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:52,740
I also just really liked Eddie Gathage's
performance. I kind of hope that he leads his own

414
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:58,520
spin-off, maybe, Justice Society show later on. I
don't know. That'd be cool. I need to see more Mr.

415
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:03,520
Terrific. That's all I know. Metamorpho joined
the Justice Gang at the very end of the film. He was

416
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,340
played by Anthony Kerrigan, who played him a
little bit more meekly than I think he's depicted

417
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:13,480
in the comics. But I did like the fact that they made
him a family man, because that's really important

418
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:20,180
to the character in DC Comics. Is his son like that
in the comic books? Green? Yeah. Interesting. I

419
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:25,960
really loved the special effects behind his
powers. It was weird, especially when he was like a

420
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:31,120
flying head, it would just have like tentacles.
Yeah. After he turned his body into acid and

421
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,800
sprayed those guys. Yeah. Yeah, really
interesting. But of course, there's also Lex

422
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,820
Luthor's own superhuman crew, which included the
engineer who was played by Maria Gabriela de

423
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:45,000
Ferreira, who was better in the movie than I
thought she would be. Like, I didn't think she

424
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:49,840
really belonged in this movie based on the
trailers, just what I know of the character. But I

425
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:55,980
thought James Gunn made good use of her, being that
she was a creation of Lex Luthor to tackle

426
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:00,560
Superman. But is that true to the authority comic
books? Does she have any association with Lex

427
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:05,160
Luthor? No, not initially. She was a wild storm
character, a member of the authority that was

428
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:10,400
brought into DC Comics later on. I guess in that
regard, she just still feels random to me. Well,

429
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,420
that's what I was afraid of, but I didn't get that
sense, because she was a part of a team called

430
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:21,420
Overwatch, created by Lex Luthor to bring down
Superman specifically. So I kind of liked the idea

431
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:27,260
that he was working on these experiments to create
superpowered individuals capable of taking on

432
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:33,100
Superman. And I thought her power set was really
cool. I was horrified when she was like flooding

433
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:38,700
Superman's mouth with nanites trying to drown
him. That was wild. I wonder why Lex didn't give

434
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:44,960
himself superpowers. I don't necessarily think
he wants them. I think he wants to prove that he's

435
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,420
better than meta-humans. He's always kind of been
anti-meta-human. Just being in control of them as

436
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:56,180
opposed to joining them. Right, yeah, he uses
them. Like the clone of Superman in this film,

437
00:42:56,180 --> 00:43:01,200
Ultraman, which I don't love that they named him
Ultraman. I don't understand why they didn't just

438
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,060
go the bizarro route with this character. Yeah,
they were trying to keep it this secret or

439
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:10,660
something like that, as if fans didn't already
know or highly suspect that this was going to be a

440
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:16,200
Superman clone underneath the mask. Well, I
wasn't 100% going in. Like it was a genuine mystery

441
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,700
who the character of Ultraman was to me. I was kind
of actually disappointed when they revealed that

442
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:26,120
it was a normal looking, for the most part,
Superman clone. Would you have preferred a

443
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:31,100
disfigured looking one? Yeah, I would have much
preferred like if Lex Luthor was still working on

444
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:37,040
perfecting his clone technology. And maybe that
would lead to Superboy in a later film. I don't

445
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,820
know. I didn't love what they did here. For all I
know, that version of Superman being sucked into

446
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:47,960
the black hole maybe ends up in some bizarro
universe and comes back later on disfigured. But

447
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,920
we'll see, I guess. I think it would have been more
expedient if you replaced Metamorpho in the movie

448
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:57,860
with Metalo. And Metalo could also serve in the
engineer's role as well. Oh, just made of like

449
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:02,960
nanites? Yeah. Yeah, Metalo and bizarro? That
would have been awesome. And I think more

450
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,340
reflective of Superman's traditional rogues
gallery. Not gonna lie, I would have loved to have

451
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:57,980
seen that. I can't even deny that. But let's move on
to the story highlights. Visit

452
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:07,440
dynamicpodcast.com where we settle the debate
and settle the score. Superman crash lands in

453
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:13,480
Antarctica three minutes after being pummeled in
Metropolis by the hammer of Baravia, who is

454
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:19,240
seemingly the mid human champion of the nation of
Baravia, an ally of the United States, whom

455
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:25,560
Superman stopped from invading its neighboring
country of Jarhenpur three weeks ago. Superman is

456
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:31,060
taken to the Fortress of Solitude by the unruly
crypto, the super dog, where he is healed with the

457
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:36,180
help of his robot assistants and a concentrated
dose of solar radiation. All while an

458
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:41,800
inspirational yet incomplete recorded message
of hope from Superman's Kryptonian parents,

459
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:47,380
Jerell and Laura, plays in the background. Once
adequately healed, Superman flies back to the

460
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:53,840
city of Metropolis, though he and his Antarctic
fortress are noticed by the engineer who works for

461
00:45:53,840 --> 00:46:01,800
and was created by Alex Luther. Again, brilliant
use of the opening crawl as it were for this film. I

462
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:07,840
guess many humans emerged three centuries ago and
in this movie, Superman is 33 years old. I'm not

463
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:12,120
sure why they went with the number three, but I
thought it totally worked timeline wise. Yeah, I

464
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:15,540
don't think there was real significance to the
number three. It was just kind of a coincidence

465
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:20,520
that all these occurrences lined up with the
number three. It made me interested in which

466
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:25,240
metahumans emerged three centuries ago. Like
what century would that have been? The 18th

467
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:30,180
century, I guess? The 1700s? You can't wait to
learn more about that, but I also liked that they

468
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:36,080
build it as ushering in age of gods and monsters,
which is the name of the first chapter,

469
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:42,260
essentially, for James Gunn's DC universe, like
his phase one. Were you surprised that Bradley

470
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:47,900
Cooper was Jerell? No, that was actually spoiled
for me beforehand and not even on social media,

471
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:53,200
like it was a news article. I was pissed. In
Metropolis, Lex and his team are alerted to

472
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:58,420
Superman's return and issue instructions to the
hammer, resulting in Superman's defeat once

473
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:04,260
again. The injured Superman is helped to his feet
by a friendly food vendor named Malik, while he's

474
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:08,860
also criticized by the public for his
intervention in the foreign conflict. The hammer

475
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:13,940
departs, flying to Fort Kramer, a nearby military
base, where a series of interdimensional

476
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:19,020
gateways through a pocket universe takes him to
Lex Luther's command center, and it's revealed

477
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:25,160
that the hammer is Ultraman, another creation of
Lexes. The hammer of Baravia is an original

478
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:31,360
character to the story, yes? Yes, yeah, he's not in
the comics. I do gotta say I really like Lex

479
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:36,900
Luther's fight system that he has set up against
Superman, where he calls out like specific moves

480
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:41,740
to Ultraman to defeat him. That was really cool.
Yeah, he essentially plotted like thousands of

481
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:46,440
moves to go against Superman, which is wild. I
thought that was really cool. It's like Lex Luther

482
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:53,480
playing a video game against Superman with like a
thousand buttons. I was surprised that the war

483
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:59,720
suit that the hammer of Baravia or Ultraman war was
not Lex Luther in a battle suit, because I totally

484
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,580
thought that was going to be the case from the
trailers. I thought that was a really cool suit,

485
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:08,500
and I kind wish Lex Luther would use it later on.
Yeah, that would have been cool. Or at least you

486
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,660
think he'd put on like a raptor suit or something
like that. Oh yeah, yeah, I guess that's green and

487
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:17,800
purple. More traditionally, Lex's colors. That
would have been cool. Nicolaar Kant arrives at the

488
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,580
Daily Planet after getting his first front page
news story published about Superman's fight with

489
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:27,500
the hammer. While Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen
questioned the hammer's motive and Superman's

490
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:33,540
actions, the president of Baravia, Vassil
Gurkos, criticizes Superman during a televised

491
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:39,480
press briefing and insists Baravia's invasion of
Jarhanpur was to liberate its people from its

492
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:45,320
oppressive government. Lex Luther meets with US
military executives at the Pentagon, presenting

493
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:51,400
Ultraman, the engineer, and an army of flying
armored soldiers known as Raptors as a military

494
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:57,840
unit known as Planet Watch, pitched as the best and
only method of neutralizing the alien threat that

495
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:03,820
Superman presents as all Kryptonite has now been
removed from the planet. Though the executives,

496
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:09,560
including Rick Fleck Sr., are hesitant to allow
Lex to kill Superman, they give Lex the authority

497
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:13,980
to hold Superman for questioning. You mentioned
that the story did a good job of showing the

498
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:18,060
multiple sides of Lex Luther as a villain as he's
been portrayed in the comic books as like, you

499
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:23,900
know, an evil scientist, a businessman. When I saw
Lex in the Pentagon speaking with generals and

500
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:30,000
stuff like that, I could easily see a route to him
becoming president in maybe like a sequel or a

501
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:34,880
third film in a trilogy down the line. Yeah, that
would be interesting. I've always loved that

502
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:40,220
storyline with Lex. It was really cool in the
comics. Now, I have to imagine that Planet Watch is

503
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:46,340
a precursor to Stormwatch in the comics, which is
related to the authority and maybe one of the

504
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:51,160
reasons they went with the engineer for this
movie, because the authority is a film that James

505
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:57,020
Gunn has been planning to be a part of this Gods and
Monsters chapter in the DC cinematic universe.

506
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:02,880
Now, Lois arrives at her apartment only to find
Clark there cooking dinner. It's revealed that

507
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,760
the two are having a secret romantic relationship
and that Lois knows Clark is Superman. After

508
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:13,480
agreeing to allow Lois to interview him as
Superman, Clark nevertheless becomes agitated

509
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:19,020
by her questions and leaves. Meanwhile, Lex
arrives in Antarctica with Ultraman, the

510
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:24,060
engineer, and his current girlfriend Eve
Tessmucker, who all infiltrates Superman's

511
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:29,160
fortress, destroys his robots, kidnaps crypto,
and steals the recording of Superman's

512
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:34,000
Kryptonian parents. To prevent Superman from
interrupting their infiltration of the

513
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,120
fortress, Lex has his team unleash a distraction
in Metropolis, a small alien creature that grows

514
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:46,700
into a skyscraper sized kaiju overnight. Now,
there's a lot of things in this film that they don't

515
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:53,640
really explain, and it makes me wonder if there was
a longer cut of this film earlier on. Things like

516
00:50:53,640 --> 00:51:00,680
the kaiju. When did it grow? Why did it grow? Where
does it come from? Things like that. Yeah, I

517
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:04,420
definitely had those questions about it as well.
Like I was maybe missing something, or maybe it was

518
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:09,120
some kind of easter egg to the comic books. Like he
was a well-known character for DC fans, but I never

519
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:14,480
got those answers. No, the kaiju. I mean, there are
kaiju's in Superman comics, but I think this one

520
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:19,900
was original to the movie. As Superman protects
Metropolis from the kaiju, the Justice Gang

521
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:25,600
arrives, with its members Guy Gardner, a Green
Lantern, Mr. Terrific, and Hawk Girl ultimately

522
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:31,560
killing the kaiju to Superman's dismay. While the
public celebrates the hero's victory, Lex Luthor

523
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:37,620
reveals on a new show a repaired and full recording
of Superman's parents, their inspirational

524
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:43,960
message of hope, followed by their wish that their
son Cal-El rule over Earth's citizens and spread

525
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:49,520
his seed to rebuild the Kryptonian lineage.
Devastated by the revelation, and with a public

526
00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:54,420
sentiment turned against him even further,
Superman realizes Luthor must have stolen the

527
00:51:54,420 --> 00:52:00,300
message from his fortress. Upon flying there,
Superman finds his robots destroyed and Krypton

528
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:06,520
missing. While President Gerkos meets with Lex
Luthor in his pocket universe, the two revealed to

529
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:13,160
be in cahoots. The kaiju scene was a great action
scene for not only Superman and showcasing how

530
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:18,080
heroic he is with the saving of like dogs and
squirrels and stuff, but also just a great

531
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:23,000
introduction, I think, to the Justice Gang. I was
looking forward to this scene from the trailers,

532
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,160
and I thought they pulled it off really well. Yeah,
it was interesting how Superman was largely

533
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:31,680
serving in a support role, like preventing
collateral damage while the rest of the heroes

534
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:37,000
took on the kaiju directly. Yeah, set Superman
apart from other heroes. They just wanted to kill

535
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:42,820
this thing. He didn't. He wanted to take it to like
an intergalactic zoo or something. I thought that

536
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:47,060
was cool. Despite confronting Lex Luthor about
Krypto's whereabouts and getting no

537
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:52,380
information, Superman returns to his metropolis
apartment after spending the day looking for the

538
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:57,980
dog. There, he and Lois discuss their strained
relationship before Superman reveals that he's

539
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:02,620
going to turn himself into the government for
questioning, figuring that may help lead him to

540
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:08,900
Krypto. While Superman is arrested by Ultraman,
Rick Flagg Sr. reveals that Superman is to be held

541
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:14,940
in Lex's custody for the time being. Superman is
escorted through the interdimensional portal at

542
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:21,060
Fort Kramer to Lex's pocket universe, where he is
placed in a prison cell with metamorpho, whom Lex

543
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:27,020
has neutralized and tortured Superman by
creating Kryptonite. Superman spots Krypto

544
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:32,940
being experimented upon and realizes Lex has no
intention of ever releasing either of them.

545
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:39,000
Meanwhile, Lois and Jimmy try to find the
connection between Lex and Baravia, resulting in

546
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:44,360
Jimmy reaching out to Eve, who turns out to be
Jimmy's obsessive ex-girlfriend and the two

547
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:50,400
agree to meet. I like the Kryptonite effect in this
movie, where it really made Superman feel more

548
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,560
alien and really feel much more affected by the
Kryptonite element than in other screen

549
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,840
adaptations where it just looks like he's sick to
his stomach or something like that. Yeah, it

550
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:04,300
definitely looks like the Kryptonite was
poisoning his blood here, and it actually did.

551
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:09,900
Kryptonite is so inconsistent, I'm glad that it
had lasting ramifications in this movie. After

552
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:15,080
Jimmy meets with Eve to ask her to find
information, Lois visits with the Justice Gang to

553
00:54:15,080 --> 00:54:20,920
ask for their help, and though their leader Guy
Gardner refuses, Mr. Terrific tracks Superman to

554
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:26,380
Fort Kramer. After Lex kills Malik in a game of
Russian roulette in front of Superman to force

555
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:32,080
information out of him, Lois and Mr. Terrific
arrive at Fort Kramer, where Terrific defeats the

556
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:37,640
soldiers there to uncover the portal to Lex's
pocket universe. While Mr. Terrific searches for

557
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:43,140
Superman using his T-Sphere, Minimorpho agrees
to help Superman escape their prison cell in

558
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:49,280
exchange for the rescue of his also imprisoned
infant son, Joseph. Though Superman manages to

559
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:55,000
rescue Joseph and Krypto, he struggles against
the Raptors and is knocked into an anti-proton

560
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,640
river before nearly getting sucked into a black
hole at the center of the pocket universe.

561
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,300
Eventually, Superman manages to escape the
pocket universe with help from Minimorpho. Along

562
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:10,400
with Mr. Terrific and Lois, the Superman
continues to suffer from Kryptonite poisoning,

563
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:15,920
and Lois takes him to the Kent Farm in Kansas while
Mr. Terrific stays behind to try to close the

564
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:22,180
portal. I feel like using Super Breath to escape a
black hole makes no sense in any sort of reality.

565
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:27,060
Okay, well how would you have done it? You could. I
don't know, squeezed my flying muscles a little

566
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:31,740
bit harder or something like that? I have no idea.
But Super Breath had me scratching my head during

567
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:37,080
the movie. Well, I think it was Super Breath
combined with Minimorpho's tugging that really

568
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:41,920
got him out of there. I did think the anti-proton
river was really cool. Did not expect to see

569
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,540
anything like that in the Superman movie. Yeah, it
was a cool special effect. For sure. Why do you

570
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:52,300
think Jimmy Olsen didn't like Eve? Because the
implication was that he was kind of shallow and

571
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:56,960
thought she had weird looking toes and that's why
he didn't like her? I mean besides the obvious

572
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:02,380
personality reasons, if she was so clingy I wonder
why they even inserted the toe thing. Yeah, it does

573
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:08,200
kind of make Jimmy look kind of bad. It had to be a
personality thing. I don't know. Furious as

574
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:14,180
Superman's escape, Lex abuses Eve, who texts
information to Jimmy out of spite, though she's

575
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:19,640
caught immediately upon doing so and imprisoned
in the pocket universe. Though Jimmy is

576
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:25,280
disappointed to see the information Eve sent was a
series of selfies, Lois recognizes that the

577
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:30,640
background of each selfie contains critical
evidence that reveals Lex's plans. Despite

578
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:36,460
warnings from his team, Lex overloads the portal
generator at Fort Cramer causing a destructive

579
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:41,820
rift to grow between realities that begins
tearing Metropolis apart and Lex's desperate bid

580
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:47,400
to attract Superman. While Clark has a heartfelt
talk with his adoptive father Jonathan Kent about

581
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:53,640
Jor-El and Lara's full message, Metropolis's
citizens evacuate the city and Baravia's army

582
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:59,440
gathers at the border ready to invade Jarhenpur,
whose citizens call out to Superman for help as

583
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:04,880
their people do not have an advanced military to
defend them. There's a few scenes in this movie

584
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:11,140
that not gonna lie got me choked up, one of them
being the discussion between Jonathan Kent and

585
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:16,660
Superman. Oh for sure, yeah really heartfelt
stuff. But also the Jarhenpur scene with the kids

586
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:21,340
lifting up the flag, that was real touching. For
sure and not just for us as audience members but

587
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:26,700
also like the characters from the Justice Gang who
decided ultimately to go help despite their

588
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:32,100
criticism of Superman doing the same thing
earlier in the film. As a parent hearing the wisdom

589
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:37,060
of Jonathan saying that parents aren't for
telling their children who they're supposed to

590
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:42,020
be, we're just here to give them the tools
essentially to make fools of themselves. I really

591
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:48,140
liked that message. Oh yeah so good. Letting your
kids make their own choices to become who they are

592
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:53,760
going to be on their own is a challenge I think as a
parent because you want the best for them and you

593
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:59,160
kind of end up wanting to control their lives in
some way but the wisdom of not doing that just

594
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:04,280
struck Yeah telling someone who they are in
general is just going to build resentment on their

595
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:09,260
part. Totally yeah. Now despite seeing the
Jarhenpurian people call out for him on

596
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:14,760
television, Superman is notified by Mr. Terrific
about what's going on in Metropolis. As

597
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:19,820
Metropolis is being destroyed, Lois and Jimmy
reveal to Daily Planet editor and chief Perry

598
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:26,800
White that Lex had given military arms to Baravia
at a discount in exchange for half of Jarhenpur's

599
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:32,980
conquered land which would serve as the site for a
tech haven as well as provide him with billions of

600
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:38,520
dollars in oil reserves. The three of them along
with several other Daily Planet journalists

601
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:43,680
write a story exposing Lex in Mr. Terrific's
hovercraft while Mr. Terrific and Superman

602
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:49,300
themselves are attacked by Ultraman and the
engineer after working to protect Metropolis's

603
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:55,220
citizens. After the engineer nearly drowns
Superman in nanites, Superman flies into space

604
00:58:55,220 --> 00:59:01,140
and crash lands back in Metropolis knocking out
the engineer along with her nanites and also

605
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:06,900
damaging Ultraman's mask which reveals that he's
a clone of Superman. What did you think of the way

606
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:12,600
Superman defeated the engineer? I liked it. I
liked how he took issues into his own accord. You

607
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:16,680
know he didn't have outside help to come in and
rescue him at the last minute like you would expect

608
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:21,820
maybe from a situation like this. He had to use his
own wits being a character who isn't necessarily

609
00:59:21,820 --> 00:59:27,420
known for his high intelligence. It was a
desperate move on his part but it made sense and it

610
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:32,940
worked. Yeah I agree. I totally thought with Mr.
Terrific being there that he was going to disable

611
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:38,940
the nanites in some way but I loved that they came up
with a unique way for Superman to overcome his own

612
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:44,940
challenge. A way that even Lex didn't foresee
coming. Yeah it was also hardcore. Even the

613
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:48,860
engineer was like I'm not going to survive this and
Lex was like the only one they're protecting is

614
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:54,240
Superman. That was genius. That was good. As Guy
Gardner, Hawkeye Girl and Metamorpho defend

615
00:59:54,240 --> 01:00:00,340
Jarhan Perr from the Baravian army going so far as
to even kill President Girkus, Ultraman

616
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:06,000
meanwhile pummel Superman under the fight
direction of Lex Luthor. With help from Crypto

617
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:11,440
however, Superman is able to disable Lex's
observational drones and knock Ultraman into the

618
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:17,460
pocket universe's black hole. After defeating
the Raptors as well, Superman, Crypto and Mr.

619
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:24,440
Terrific crash into Lex's flying command center
and after a brief debate between Superman and Lex,

620
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:30,480
Crypto attacks Lex, injuring him while Mr.
Terrific hacks Lex's systems to reverse the rift

621
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:36,440
destroying the city. Once the Daily Planet's
expose outs Lex as manipulating the war between

622
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:43,400
Baravia and Jarhan Perr, Lex is arrested and his
pocket universe prisoners are set free including

623
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:51,160
Eve who embraces a reluctant Jimmy. Superman and
Lois also share a kiss. This whole third act was so

624
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:58,120
action packed and so fun to watch. I do have to call
BS on a code fixing that rift between dimensions

625
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:03,980
though. I don't know how that's possible. Kind of
the whole Silver Age zockiness at work there.

626
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:08,120
Yeah. But the rest of it I loved. Do you think the
Justice Gang will come under the same kind of

627
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:12,940
scrutiny that Superman did for interfering in an
international conflict going so far as to

628
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:18,360
assassinate a world leader? I was actually
wondering that. I think with revelation that Lex

629
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:24,240
was manipulating them and that President Gerchos
was corrupt, probably gives them a bit of

630
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:31,460
leniency. Maybe. I really didn't appreciate how
the whole Crypto attacking Lex comedic beat in the

631
01:01:31,460 --> 01:01:38,000
film was a direct ripoff of the puny god scene where
the Hulk beats the shit out of Loki in the Avengers

632
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:48,200
film. It was like this same exact joke. That's a
beyond the reasoning of the antagonists just

633
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:53,360
being more of a force of nature and beating the shit
out of the villain because they can. For me it was

634
01:01:53,360 --> 01:01:58,680
almost the same exact moment. Okay so that's only a
lot to happen once in storytelling for all of

635
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:04,720
history? At least for superhero films? Yes. No.
I'm sorry. It was way cooler when Crypto did it. Now

636
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:09,220
back at the fortress of solitude as Superman
undergoes healing treatment from his now

637
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:16,080
repaired robot servants, a drunk super girl
arrives and is reunited with her dog Crypto. After

638
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:21,560
she leaves, Superman watches videos of himself
growing up with his adoptive parents, the Kents in

639
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:27,480
Kansas. In a mid-credits scene, he and Crypto
overlook the planet from the moon and in an

640
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:33,760
end-credits scene, Superman chastises himself
for being a jerk after pointing out to an irate Mr.

641
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,940
Terrific that the city was not seamlessly
rejoined after closing the rift. I gotta say both

642
01:02:38,940 --> 01:02:43,240
the mid-credits scene and end-credits scene were
entirely worthless. Like I did not need to see

643
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:49,640
them, I regret wasting my time. Well it's been said
that DC Studios is not going to make the mistake of

644
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:55,100
recent Marvel Studios films in setting up
promises that they can't deliver. It wasn't

645
01:02:55,100 --> 01:03:00,960
really necessary, it was cute, it was comedic. I'm
glad I stayed for them. I think to that end they

646
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:06,940
should just not have mid or end-credits Why even
include them if it's just going to be pointless?

647
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:12,100
You know what? Just let DC do what it's going to do.
You don't need to worry about it. I did really like

648
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:16,200
the ending how Superman started watching the
videos of Ma and Pa Kante as opposed to his

649
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:21,340
Kryptonian parents. That whole switch-up was I
thought a great culmination to his arc because it

650
01:03:21,340 --> 01:03:27,440
spoke to how he started defining himself. I
actually kind of loved how they played up more on Ma

651
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:34,040
and Pa Kante in this movie than Krypton. Even with
Pa and Ma Kante being portrayed as the simpletons

652
01:03:34,040 --> 01:03:38,600
that they were, to Clark they were still more
important because they were the ones who raised

653
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:44,960
him than his Kryptonian parents. You know in Man of
Steel we got a really brilliant take on Krypton and

654
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:49,180
I wasn't really sure that this film could improve
on something like that and I'm kind of glad it

655
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:54,360
didn't even really try to. Like Krypton is
interesting but beyond it being the planet he came

656
01:03:54,360 --> 01:04:01,600
from his real origin story is his upbringing in
Smallville by Jonathan and Martha Kent and I'm

657
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:06,400
glad that this film acknowledged that. Yeah
Krypton is irrelevant to his actual character.

658
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:13,160
This film really puts the causation of Superman's
morals and ethics on the Kants which kudos to the

659
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:18,700
film. Yeah there's a lot that this film gets right.
It surprised me in a lot of ways. I thought it was

660
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:24,480
profound in more ways than I would have thought it
would have been. It was a soaring reminder that

661
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:31,240
true heroism lies not in mites but in the radical
choice to see goodness in others. I thought it was a

662
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:37,380
bold heartfelt and fun start to the new DC
universe. I loved this movie. It's not perfect but

663
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:43,860
it's really close so I'm giving it four and a half
out of five stars. A fresh rating on Rotten

664
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:50,280
Tomatoes. Yeah I think viewing it on a surface
level doesn't quite seem as profound as it

665
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:55,440
actually is if you look deeper. You know that whole
message is the essence of Superman. At least how he

666
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:01,060
should be and beyond that I think the film was just a
lot of fun and a lot more true to the tone of the comic

667
01:05:01,060 --> 01:05:05,600
books and true to the characterization. You can't
really ask for much more than that from a superhero

668
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:10,680
film. So yeah I think four and a half stars is a solid
rating. I cannot wait for the Supergirl movie

669
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:16,280
after this. I cannot wait to see Batman. I really
hope they incorporate Robert Pattinson's The

670
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:22,940
Batman into this universe because I think it would
work perfectly. I'm so stoked to be a DC fan right

671
01:05:22,940 --> 01:05:28,660
now and see what they have coming up. What a time to
be alive. And I gotta say Marvel's Fantastic Four

672
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:34,760
has a lot to live up to after this movie. Oh it's up
for the challenge and then some. You'll see. It is

673
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:40,320
going to get trounced by Superman. No way
Fantastic Four has a chance. R.A .P. Marvel

674
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:46,720
Studios. Calling it now. You know what I like. I
give this movie zero stars. Well thank goodness it

675
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:51,420
doesn't matter what you think. And also I'll
remember that in my review of Fantastic Four.

676
01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:59,220
Never mind. Never mind. But that does it for this
review. AJ9K help close this out. Thanks for

01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:35,560
our next episode we will be doing a quick break from
the reviews to do a team duel this time pitting the

683
01:06:35,560 --> 01:06:40,980
Justice League International versus the West
Coast Avengers. It's the Justice League versus

684
01:06:40,980 --> 01:06:46,120
the Avengers again. Yes like a rematch or like a
grudge match where this time the Avengers are

685
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:51,280
going to be kicking all kinds of ass. Not as much as
the Justice League. You'll learn. But that does it

686
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:55,420
for this episode. We want to give a big thanks to our
executive producers John Straussky, Zachary

690

podcast possible. We'll talk to you guys next
week. Up, up and away, true believers. I'm so punk

691
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:18,820
rock that I despise punk rock.
