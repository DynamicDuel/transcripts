00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,760
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi and welcome
to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,520
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,480
their characters and stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe and I'm his twin

4
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,340
brother Johnny DC. And guys, there are only three
episodes left of this podcast in its weekly

5
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:50,500
format. We're semi-retiring in mid-January as we
turn 40. We've been doing this podcast for 10 years

6
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:57,060
now and we're coming up to the end here. This will be
our last Brothers Award episode as well as the last

7
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:04,920
episode of 2025, which is wild. This year went by so
quick. It's ridiculous. I remember the 2024

8
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,940
Brothers Award episode like it was yesterday.
It's getting crazy. If you guys have never

9
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:15,800
listened to a Brothers Award episode before, it's
basically the best of what Marvel and DC put out in

10
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:22,260
terms of television and film over the year. The
Brothers Awards are named after the cosmic DC and

11
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:28,420
Marvel entities that were in the 1996 DC versus
Marvel crossover series. Right. In fact, those

12
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:36,080
figures are on our award images that we post to
Instagram as like Oscar statues. This is our

13
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:41,820
Oscars, but it's better than the Oscars. It's way
better than the Oscars, man. First of all, our

14
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,780
awards actually mean something. It's not just a
popularity contest. I haven't trusted the Oscars

15
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:52,920
since they snubbed the Dark Knight. Never forgive
them for that. I never forgive the Oscars for not

16
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,140
giving Black Panther the award for best picture.
Anyway, we're not going to be going over the comic

17
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,800
book movie news this episode because Jonathan and
I are recording this episode earlier, so we don't

18
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,160
have a good handle on what the current news is. But
also, I'm hoping that Marvel is going to release

19
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,280
the full set of Doomsday trailers online so that
everybody can watch them as they're meant to be

20
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,900
seen and not just like the leaked versions. Who
knows? Maybe by the time this episode drops, that

21
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,600
will be the case. But if it is, we're not talking
about it until 2026. Right. This episode is just

22
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,420
going to be All Brothers Awards. But before that,
our artificially intelligent duel simulator,

23
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:36,820
AJ9K, has a quick message for our listeners. So
listen up. Hello. These are the final episodes of

36
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:48,040
reviewed with Matt, Halo Legends. Over on the Max
Destruction podcast, hosts Scotty and Gilly pay

are off this week, but look forward to their next
episode in the new year. On the Senjoh World

39
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:01,860
podcast, host Zachary Hepburn speculates on
fights between fan favorite anime and manga

40
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:08,280
characters. In January, Zach is revealing who
would win between Shigeo Kagayama, aka Mob from

41
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,220
Mob Psycho 100, and Tatsumaki the tornado of
terror from One Punch Man. Visit

Podcast Network. But now that that's done, let's
go ahead and set the stage. We got the blue carpet

44
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,700
rolled out. I'm sick of the carpets. We can never
decide whether it's blue or red. You know what?

45
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:36,380
Marvel doesn't need theirs this year because our
nominees are parachuting in in style with red

46
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,460
parachutes. Okay, well if that's the case, the DC
nominees are just gonna teleport into their seats

47
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:47,240
in a puff of electric blue smoke with sparkles.
Magic. Like Nightcrawler? Yeah, except it

48
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,400
doesn't smell like farts. This is stupid. Anyway,
the nominees are making their way to the

49
00:04:52,400 --> 00:05:07,720
auditorium. Let's go ahead and get into our 2025
Best of Marvel and DC Brothers Awards. All right,

50
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:14,320
everyone. Welcome to the 2025 Brothers Awards,
where we countdown the best that Marvel and DC had

51
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,580
to offer in the realm of television and film.
Johnny DC and myself are here on the stage hosting

52
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,900
you this evening. Gotta say you're looking sharp.
And you're looking a little blunt. I take it back.

53
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:32,960
Let's go ahead and start off by breaking down what
was eligible for an award in the year 2025. Spoiler

54
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,520
warning, for anyone who has not seen any of these
projects, we will be potentially spoiling any one

55
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:46,180
of these in the course of our award ceremony. For DC
in television this year, we had Creature

56
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:55,020
Commandos season one, Harley Quinn season five,
The Sandman season two, Peacemaker season two,

57
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:01,620
and Batman season one. And on the big and small
screens, we saw Batman Ninja versus Yakuza

58
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:08,600
League, Superman, and Aztec Batman Clash of
Empires. Gotta say that's a pretty lackluster

59
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:14,620
list overall when compared to the Marvel list. Let
me tell you what was eligible for Marvel. In 2025,

60
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:20,040
we had your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man
season one, Daredevil born again season one, Iron

61
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:27,260
Heart season one, Eyes of Wakanda season one, and
Marvel Zombies season one. In theaters, we had

62
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:33,360
Captain America Brave New World, Thunderbolts,
and the Fantastic Four first steps. I don't know

63
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,440
how you're going to bash DC's output. We're all by
two things on your list that you just read was pure

64
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,680
trash. Trash recognized trash is what I'm going to
say. Hey, I'm classy. Anyway, let's go ahead and

65
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,780
get into our very first award for the evening,
which will be the best trailer. Now, I don't know if

66
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,600
a lot of people pay attention to trailers, but
Jonathan and I like watching them. We definitely

67
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,060
like getting a taste of what's to come,
speculating on what the trailers show us and

68
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:04,120
getting hyped in general. Yeah, actually, by
profession, Joseph and I are both marketers, and

69
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,400
it's really interesting to see how studios try and
sell general audiences on the films that they're

70
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:15,740
putting out. To that end, I chose four nominees for
this award based on how well they did at selling me

71
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:22,560
and getting me excited on seeing the project.
Same. And the DC nominees for best trailer of 2025

72
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,700
are Peacemaker season two official trailer.
There's another dimension. It's exactly the same

73
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:40,760
as ours. But better. Best dimension ever. The
Sandman season two date announcement. A king will

74
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:52,820
forsake his kingdom. The oldest battle begins
once more. Supergirl official teaser trailer. He

75
00:07:52,820 --> 00:08:03,580
sees the good in everyone and I see the truth.
Superman official trailer. I would question

76
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:11,480
myself in the same situation and consider the
consequences. People were going to die. Okay, if I

77
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:17,220
had to guess among those list of nominees, I'm not
going to say that the winner is Supergirl or

78
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,960
Peacemaker. I think it's going to be either the
Superman trailer or Sandman. I think you're going

79
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:31,940
to go with Sandman on this. And the winner is
Superman official trailer. Damn it. The Sandman

80
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:37,740
trailer was incredible. And I had a really hard
time choosing between that and Superman.

81
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:43,659
Ultimately, I went with Superman because I feel
like we got our first really good look at how David

82
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:49,680
Corrin set was going to portray the character of
Clark Kent and Superman really. But also a taste of

83
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,160
the story that we were going to get as well. To hear
the dialogue and see some of the performances

84
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,120
really sold me on the movie. And it got me super
excited for this new universe that James Gunn was

85
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:05,000
going to unveil. Yeah, it wasn't the first
Superman trailer. I think actually the first one

86
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,040
came out last year in 2024 and also got your
brother's award for best trailer. So you're just

87
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,560
really gunk-ho for Superman when it comes to
trailers. I am doubling down. Yes, I really liked

88
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,640
the movie and I thought they did a really good job
selling the movie as well. Well, audience be

89
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,520
prepared for most of these awards to be going to the
Superman movie. Bitch, you don't know my life.

90
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,580
What else is the award going to go to? Really think
about it. Anyway, let's move on to the Marvel

91
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:40,760
Award. The nominees for best Marvel trailer in
2025 are Daredevil born again official trailer. I

92
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:52,620
was also raised to believe in retribution. The
Fantastic Four first steps official trailer. Are

93
00:09:52,620 --> 00:10:01,400
you the protectors of this world? Yes, we are. Your
planet is now marked for death. Marvel Zombies

94
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:17,120
official trailer. Shit. Thunderbolts final
trailer. No one here is a hero. You all have things

95
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:26,700
that we regret. But I have so many. Oh, those are
some good choices. The Marvel Zombies trailer was

96
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:31,620
super metal. I don't think they would get the win,
though. I'm going to say you're probably going to

97
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:38,820
choose Fantastic Four first steps, largely for
the same reason that I went with Superman in that

98
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,600
you were able to glimpse for the first time this
new-ish sort of world since the Fantastic Four

99
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:52,000
took place in an alternate universe from the MCU.
And the winner is the Fantastic Four first steps

100
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,320
official trailer. Yes! For exactly the reason
that you said basically, you know, with

101
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,600
Daredevil, we had a good feeling, especially
after the reshoots that the series was going to be

102
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,720
true in keeping with the Netflix show. And it was.
So that was a great trailer. Marvel Zombies was

103
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,340
again so metal. It was probably the most fun I had
watching a trailer in years. And the Thunderbolts

104
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:19,840
final trailer was not the best trailer that we got
for that film that actually came out in 2024. But

105
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,860
the Fantastic Four first steps official trailer
introduced us to this whole new world, very

106
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:32,920
stylish, very sleek, very Jack Kirby-esque. And I
was on board. Like, I saw that and I immediately

107
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,260
fell in love with this new universe that the film
was taking place in. I read you. I read you. You got

108
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,900
your guess right. I got my guess wrong. Let's not
talk about it. Let's move on to the next award. So

109
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:49,360
the next award is Best Original Music. Now, when it
comes to original scores and songs for these

110
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:56,080
Marvel and DC films, good music should do a lot of
heavy lifting emotionally as you're watching

111
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:02,520
what's unfolding on the screen. As I've said
before, the way I define a good score is one that I

112
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:08,320
don't necessarily notice as I'm watching the
film, but still moves me. Right. Movies and shows

113
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,000
are not just visual experiences. They are
auditory. And so I always really like doing this

114
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,960
award because superhero movies have such unique,
epic and interesting music out of all the other

115
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:26,500
genres out there. The nominees for Best Marvel
Original Music in 2025 are Eyes of Wakanda, Season

116
00:12:26,500 --> 00:13:11,360
1. The Fantastic Four, First Steps.
Thunderbolts. Your friendly neighborhood

117
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:30,160
Spider-Man, Season 1. Spider-Man, The Final
Fantasy. Okay, another tough call here. I love all

118
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,220
of these scores, but if I had to guess, your vibe
would naturally be drawn to your friendly

119
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:43,880
neighborhood Spider-Man's music. And the winner
is The Fantastic Four, First Steps. Whoa, that was

120
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:51,440
way off. You know what? The friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man, Season 1 soundtrack was top tier.

121
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,280
This was one of the hardest years ever when it came
to music because all four of these nominees

122
00:13:55,280 --> 00:14:00,480
fucking crushed it. We didn't review your
friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, Season 1, but

123
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,480
the show was really well done. Thunderbolts, a
very emotional score. Eyes of Wakanda, just

124
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,520
fucking incredible. That show was awesome, at
least visually and auditorily, if not

125
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,320
story-wise. I didn't love the stories for Eyes of
Wakanda. They were okay. Mostly about the War

126
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:21,600
Dogs. Like the history of the War Dogs. We got to
learn the origin of that pickaxe weapon that

127
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,120
Kilmogger found in the museum and stuff like that.
But the Fantastic Four, First Steps score written

128
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:32,420
by Michael Guccino was almost unlike anything I'd
ever heard before. In that he perfectly managed to

129
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:38,460
capture the artistic direction. It was kind of
like retro, futuristic, kind of Jetson style, but

130
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:43,220
very catchy. And also very epic when it came to
things like the Galactus and Silver Surfer

131
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:48,820
themes. It was nothing short of fantastic. Yeah,
he definitely nailed both the era and the niche

132
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:54,480
genre of the film. For sure. Michael Guccino has
done other Marvel works like The Doctor Strange

133
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,220
Movie, Spider-Man Homecoming Trilogy, and of
course he directed Werewolf by Night. He's just

134
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,520
kind of like a master at finding these like perfect
little vignettes for the style of each franchise.

135
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:11,320
Nice. Good choice. Good choice. Great nominees.
But now let's move to DC. The DC nominees for best

136
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:47,120
original music of 2025 are Aztec Batman, Clash of
Clans. Batman Ninja vs Yakuza League. The Sandman

137
00:15:47,120 --> 00:16:18,480
Season 2. Superman. Batman Ninja vs Yakuza
League. That is all incredible music as well. I

138
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,280
think though you're going to give it to Sandman
Season 2 because it allegedly has the greatest

139
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:30,400
song of all time sung by Orpheus to Hades and
Persephone. And the winner is the Sandman Season

140
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:39,040
2. And you are correct. This was a tough one this
year. I think like your Isabel Kanda score, Aztec

141
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:45,400
Batman kind of perfectly captured the cultural
sounds. And the Superman score was a great update

142
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:52,800
of the John Williams score from the 70s. I did
really want to give this award to Batman Ninja vs

143
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:58,860
Yakuza League just because of how wacky that score
was and how fun it was. Ultimately though, I could

144
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:05,839
not give it to the Sandman Season 2. Not only is just
the theme of that song really haunting and good,

145
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,200
but the music from this season in particular
played such an important and critical role within

146
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,280
the story. Like you mentioned, the song of
Orpheus. And at the very end of the show, they

147
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:24,140
played this song that was a poem from The Fates at
the end of the comic. Hearing that in song form was

148
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:31,320
such a cathartic moment to happen at the end of that
series. It was very special and that's why it gets

149
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:37,720
my award this year. Yeah, kudos to the Sandman
Season 2 for putting 110% effort into the music

150
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,540
that was featured on that season. Really well
deserved. Orpheus's song, Holy Cow. Like The

151
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:48,220
Fates, I also will never forgive Orpheus for
making me weep during that song. You have to be a

152
00:17:48,220 --> 00:18:01,520
machine not to cry. But let's go ahead and move on to
our next award, which is Best New On Screen

153
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,760
Character in 2025. Now one of the best things about
being a Marvel and DC fan, seeing these works

154
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,900
adapted on the screen, is that we get to witness the
manifestation of a lot of characters we love from

155
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:19,280
the comics in live action. Sometimes animated.
Yeah, there's been so many comic book films to have

156
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,360
come out in these past 20 years that I'm always
interested to see like which new characters are

157
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:31,740
being adapted. And there were a lot of fun ones this
year for both DC and Marvel, I feel. The nominees

158
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:48,820
for the Best New On Screen Character of 2025 for DC
are The Bride from Creature Commandos Season 1.

159
00:18:48,820 --> 00:19:26,500
Daniel Hall from The Sandman Season 2. Crypto from
Superman. Mr. Terrific from Superman. Alright,

160
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:31,700
it's definitely not going to be crypto. I think
it's a toss up between The Bride and Mr. Terrific.

161
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,320
And I think personally, I just really loved how
badass The Bride was from Creature Commandos. So

162
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:42,720
that's who I think you're going to give it to. And
the winner is The Bride from Creature Commandos

163
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:51,800
Season 1. Alright, count it. My streak starts now.
So I really liked Mr. Terrific from Superman. He

164
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:57,840
almost got this award. But ultimately, I felt that
The Bride really stole the show for me in Creature

165
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,500
Commandos Season 1. My favorite book is
Frankenstein. And I thought I was going to like his

166
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:09,360
character the most in that show. But the episode
that delved into The Bride's origin, I think was

167
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:17,740
such a perfect origin for the character and really
delved into why she is the way she is. And honestly,

168
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:23,760
I can't wait to see more from her in the DC universe.
She basically made that show and it was a great

169
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:28,240
show. I agree. I also thought I would like
Frankenstein more, but he turned out to be so

170
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:34,280
detestable. And The Bride was so fucking cool.
Such a badass. Well deserved, let's go ahead and

171
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:41,180
move into the Marvel Award. The nominees for the
best new on-screen Marvel character in 2025 are

172
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:52,800
Galactus from The Fantastic Four First Steps. I
was once little like you billions of years ago. A

173
00:20:52,800 --> 00:21:00,540
man from another world. The Hood from Iron Heart
Season 1. I knew that if I wanted you dead, I'd have

174
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:07,700
to be the one to do it. I did not come here to play with
you Parker. You came here to work. Red Hulk from

175
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:22,520
Captain America Brave New World. Since when were
they red? Century from Thunderbolts. Introduced

176
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:32,380
to you the Century. Hey guys. Wow. That's cool. All
powerful. I feel like it's either going to come

177
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:38,500
down to the Century or Galactus, but I gotta go with
Galactus. That's my guess. And the winner is

178
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:48,540
Century from Thunderbolts. How could you not go
with Galactus? Well, at least it was a portrait as a

179
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:55,140
cloud this go around, right? In the end, the
visuals for Galactus were stunning, but I just

180
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:59,540
don't think you got quite enough screen time to
warrant the best new on-screen character. I

181
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:05,360
really love what they did with the Century, with
Lewis Pullman's acting and the way they adapted

182
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,620
his origin story from his comic book origin. I
thought it was brilliantly done and told a really

183
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:15,280
interesting story. That's fair. I kind of felt
going in that the Century was going to be a hard

184
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:22,060
character to adapt because he's so unique, but
yeah, they did a fantastic job adapting him. They

185
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:27,640
kind of made it look easy, right? Jerks. Yeah, I
love how powerful they made the character. I love

186
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:33,380
how they interpreted his dark side, the void. Just
yeah, all around stellar job. But let's go ahead

187
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:40,380
and move on to our next award category, best
villain. In my opinion, a lot of comic book films

188
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:46,200
are only as good as their villain because as I've
noticed in a lot of projects, the better the

189
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:52,760
villain, the better I tend to feel about the story.
For sure, yeah, because they deliver the stakes

190
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:58,040
that are required of the hero to surpass and make
the story interesting. The neat thing about comic

191
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:03,780
book movies and shows, due to the nature of their
fairly black and white portrayals of morality and

192
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:09,820
justice, you get a lot of really fucking evil
characters as villains. Just dudes that you love

193
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:16,120
to hate. Let's go ahead and list them out. The
nominees for best Marvel villain in 2025 are

194
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:27,000
Galactus from the Fantastic Four first steps. I
will meet your planet slowly while your child

195
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:36,080
watches. Kingpin from Daredevil, born again,
season one. The rule of law will prevail. And

196
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:43,700
should you go back to any of your old activities,
there will be consequences. The hood from Iron

197
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:57,200
Heart, season one. Stay and I'll kill you. Talk to
the cops. Knowledge. The void from Thunderbolts.

198
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:06,040
The most shameful thing of all was thinking you
could be anything more than nothing. Okay, tough

199
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,740
call, tough call. My guess is either going to come
down to the void or Galactus, but I'm going to go

200
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:18,520
with Galactus again. That's my guess. And the
winner is Galactus from the Fantastic Four first

201
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:27,520
steps. And it's because he wasn't a clown. I just
think in terms of threat level, like you saw him

202
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:33,340
destroy an entire planet in the Fantastic Four
movie. And he was also really menacing when he was

203
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,560
like, I'm going to devour your entire world and
steal your baby. The fact that he wasn't even

204
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:42,240
tricked by the Fantastic Four's plan at the end and
they had to kind of like improvise to even defeat

205
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,060
him, I thought made him a great villain. There was a
little bit of a power scaling issue in that final

206
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:52,140
fight with Sue, but you know, she ended up dying. So
Galactus even has that going for him as far as a

207
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,060
villain goes. Galactus is one of those characters
where he felt like it was going to be really hard to

208
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:02,820
adapt the character to screen in a way that didn't
make people laugh and chuckle because he just

209
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:09,960
looks so weird and Kirby-esque. You know, it's
obviously why they didn't go that route in the old

210
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:16,900
Fantastic Four films, but the fact that Marvel had
the balls to do it correctly for this film, I have to

211
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:22,320
commend because it was super effective. I was
afraid of Galactus, maybe for the first time in my

212
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:34,300
entire life. Good. Keep it that way. Okay. Moving
on to the DC side. The nominees for best DC villain

213
00:25:34,300 --> 00:26:03,600
of 2025 are the Kindly Ones from Sandman from
Batman Ninja vs. Yakuza League. Lena Luther from

214
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:11,320
Harley Quinn Season 5. I don't want to play with
your toys. I want to destroy them like you always

215
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:18,220
destroyed me, making me feel lesser an
afterthought. Lex Luthor from Superman. It is

216
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:27,780
what has driven me to annihilating you. What a,
what a, what a, what a, what a. Geez, I think it's

217
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:32,000
really going to come down to the Kindly Ones or Lex
Luthor. I think I got to go with the Kindly Ones

218
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,660
though because they literally killed the God.
That's my guess. The winner is Lex Luthor from

219
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:47,580
Superman. Really, it came down to Lex or Lena for
me. We didn't review Harley Quinn Season 5, but

220
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:56,360
Lena Luther is probably the best villain that that
series has had. Hey Lena, you're a bitch.

221
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:02,360
Ultimately though, I gave it to Lex Luthor because
I thought Nicholas Holt gave the most comic,

222
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:09,280
accurate portrayal of Lex Luthor that we've seen
on screen to date. He was a genius. He was an angry,

223
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:15,220
envious genius to boot, and I'm really happy with
the direction they took the character for this new

224
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:19,980
universe. And it was cool to see him again in the
Peacemaker show. Yeah, just orchestrating shit

225
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,700
from behind the scenes. That's what Lex Luthor
needs to be. Well, let's go ahead and move on to the

226
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:32,800
flip side of this award, Best Hero of 2025. Why do we
award the best heroes in film and television?

227
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:40,180
Because they deserve to be awarded. This is a
fucking comic book podcast. Yeah, I was gonna say

228
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:47,960
because they deserve to be rewarded for their
virtues of sacrifice, nobility, and bravery. Oh

229
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,880
yeah, that too. Yeah, heroism is defined by
sacrifice and selflessness. These are really

230
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:59,460
awesome traits that humanity has admired since
they first started telling stories. Marvel and DC

231
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:05,280
have some of the most iconic heroes from the past
century, so let's celebrate them. The nominees

232
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:24,480
for best DC hero of 2025 are Batman from Batman
Ninja vs. Yakuza League. This is the pain of all the

233
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:33,820
people you're watching. I'm killing you because
you took the life of the only friend I have and the

234
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:40,840
only one of us with an out... Mr. Terrific from
Superman. Get him someplace safe. Take the

235
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:46,140
T-Craft. The controls are easy and intuitive. I
need to stay back here and make sure the portal is

236
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:52,940
secure. Superman from Superman. I don't know how
else to find him. It's a dog. Yeah, and he's not even

237
00:28:52,940 --> 00:29:00,720
a very good one, but he's out there alone and he's
probably scared. Gee, let me think. Could it be

238
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:10,600
Superman from Superman? And the winner is Batman
from Batman Ninja vs. Yakuza League. Why are you

239
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:17,840
lying? I'm not lying. That's who I gave the award
to. Superman, of course, was very heroic in the

240
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:25,300
Superman movie. He saved Metropolis, but equally
just as impressive, Batman saved Gotham from the

241
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:30,360
Yakuza League. And the way he went about it,
helping to defeat each member of the Justice

242
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:36,400
League, including Rassal Ghul, I think
ultimately it was just a much cooler and much more

243
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:42,240
impressive feat, so he got the win. Yeah, it was
pretty cool. I mean, he utilized a lot of the Bat

244
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,540
family to help him out, but that's who Batman is.
It's just kind of fascinating to see Batman go up

245
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:52,680
against these much more powerful people, and
especially in this case when the rest of them are

246
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:57,900
all alternate evil versions of themselves. And
that's why he got the win. I think it'll surprise a

247
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:02,100
lot of people with that award, but I don't
necessarily think you're wrong. Let's move on to

248
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:09,940
the Marvel side. The nominees for best Marvel hero
of 2025 are Captain America from Captain America

249
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:17,900
Brave New World. But when showing there's more to
you, it's not about when times are easy. It's about

250
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:27,680
moments like this. Daredevil from Daredevil,
born again, season one. But this is our city, not

251
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:37,180
his. And we can't take it back. Invisible Woman
from the Fantastic Four first steps. I will not

252
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:46,700
sacrifice my child for this world. But I will not
sacrifice this world for my child. Yelena Belova

253
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:57,960
from Thunderbolts. What I said to you before was
wrong, but you can't stuff it down. Okay,

254
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:04,000
personally for me, I think there's a clear
standout amongst these heroes, and I gotta say

255
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:12,480
that is Invisible Woman from Fantastic Four First
Steps. And the winner is Invisible Woman from the

256
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:18,840
Fantastic Four First Steps. Makes sense, right? I
mean, she did make the ultimate sacrifice within

257
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:26,240
that film, and a fucking broke my heart in that
scene. She gave literally everything she had to

258
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,020
save her son. And you know, a lot of people might
count her as being a little bit more selfish and

259
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,240
that she didn't want to sacrifice her son for the
sake of the entire planet, which is really the

260
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:41,460
utilitarian approach. She kind of took on the
Steve Rogers philosophy of we don't trade lives.

261
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:47,580
She knew that her family would find a solution to
really protect everybody. Oh yeah, totally. I

262
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:52,860
mean, as I was watching the movie, I was like, you
kind of gotta make the trade, right? Until she gave

263
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:58,340
her reasoning that, hey, I'm not going to give up my
baby, but I'm also not going to give up all of you

264
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:03,280
guys. I'm not going to give up the entire planet for
my baby. Right. The sacrifice she made at the end,

265
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:09,380
like you said, is the ultimate act of heroism. So
yeah, this is an easy win for her. Which is not to

266
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:14,380
discount the others. It's just that, you know,
like, I think Sam Wilson's arc in Brave New World

267
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:19,460
was kind of a rehash and also better represented in
the Falcon and the Winter Soldier TV series.

268
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:23,920
Daredevil, of course, was always great. Yelena
Bolova was a standout on Thunderbolts. I just

269
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:29,340
don't think that they compared to Invisible Woman
in terms of pure heroism. I agree. Well, moving on

270
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:35,820
to our next award category, that is for best
moment. Now for a lot of people, the main reason why

271
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:43,400
they enjoy comic book films is escapism. And with
escapism, it's really easy to lose yourself in a

272
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:50,520
film when it comes to really intense or really
funny or really action packed moments, which the

273
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:56,440
comic book genre delivers in spades many times.
It's one of the reasons why the comic book genre is

274
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:00,720
so successful in theaters as a whole. Of course,
we're seeing diminishing returns on that. But

275
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:06,420
yeah, there's a lot to enjoy about these films in
terms of spectacle and emotion. Let's break down

276
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:13,640
the best Marvel moments. The nominees for best
Marvel moment of 2025 are Celestial Island

277
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:29,660
Dogfight from Captain America, Brave New World.
Daredevil vs Bullseye from Daredevil Born Again

278
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:55,660
Season 1. Inside the Void from Thunderbolts. Sue
fights Galactus from The Fantastic Four First

279
00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:11,739
Steps. Okay another clear standout winner for me
personally, I would have to say Inside the Void.

280
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:19,460
That's my guess. And the winner is Daredevil vs
Bullseye from Daredevil Born Again Season 1.

281
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:25,100
What? I thought we got such a better version of that
in past seasons of Daredevil. No, actually I think

282
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:30,560
the Daredevil vs Bullseye fight scene was the best
version of that fight that we've gotten in this

283
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:38,100
series. And it literally delivered on every
possible angle from the action to the spectacle to

284
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:43,600
the emotion. It was fucking devastating. Like,
Sue dying while fighting Galactus was

285
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:49,280
heartbreaking. But also, Foggy Nelson dying was
heartbreaking as Daredevil heard his heart stop

286
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,820
at the end and then he threw Bullseye off the
building and it was emotionally devastating. I

287
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,300
remember watching that first episode and just
being like, how the fuck are they gonna top this

288
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:04,580
because that was the legitimately perfect scene.
I guess it was cool to see the two go at it in costume

289
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:09,820
for the first time. And it was done in that now
iconic hallway fight style for the Daredevil

290
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:17,000
series. The body count alone was massive just in
that fight and it really tore the protagonist

291
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:24,020
completely apart. It was incredible. It probably
was the best scene of the entire show. Right. And I

292
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:28,960
guess that's why you gave it the award for best
moment. There you go. Okay, well moving on to DC.

293
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:39,060
The nominees for the best DC moments of 2025 are
Batman vs Kuraku from Batman Ninja vs Yakuza

294
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:59,240
League. Die! Just as expected. EarthX reveal from
Peacemaker Season 2. Fuck me. This is your perfect

295
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:09,920
world, huh? Mr. Terrific vs Lux's army from
Superman. I am giving you one last chance to start.

296
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:21,440
I was just about to say the same to you. Superman vs
Planet Watch from Superman. Kill him! Good luck

297
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:33,700
with that. These were all fantastic moments.
Geez, that's really tough. Because the Batman vs

298
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:38,960
Superman fight in the Yakuza League movie was
probably among the best that's ever been done. But

299
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:45,080
I think it's going to go to either the Mr. Terrific
scene or Superman vs Planet Watch. I'm going to go

300
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:53,040
with Superman vs Planet Watch as my guess. The
winner is Superman vs Planet Watch from Superman.

301
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:58,380
You got it. I mean, it was probably among the best
displays of Superman's abilities that we've ever

302
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:04,180
seen on screen. It was like emotional and happy. Oh
yeah, the music during this scene and just

303
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:10,460
watching Superman unload on an entire army of
flying soldiers in a way that we've never really

304
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:17,900
been able to see him do before in a city alongside
crypto. It was just magical. It was heartwarming.

305
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:24,380
I had all the feels. My arms were raised just from
the thrill of it and the theater. It was awesome. It

306
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,720
was amazing how he was able to fight those guys
without completely destroying the entire city

307
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:35,340
and killing millions of people. Yeah? You're
saying that to me or Zack Snyder? Zack Snyder!

308
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:51,280
Yeah, it's a fair criticism. I'm going to go with
the best. Prepare yourself for the ultimate

315
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:38,640
But now let's move on to our next award category,
which is Best Actress of 2025. It gets harder and

316
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:45,720
harder every year to describe these categories in
a way that isn't over-reductive. Best Actress

317
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:50,860
Award, I think you guys all know what this means.
Yeah, often in comics, women were relegated to

318
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:57,140
sort of damsels in distress. I think as time has
gone on, comic books and filmmakers have tried to

319
00:38:57,140 --> 00:39:01,740
move away from that. And of course, have been
giving women a lot of strong roles, which I think is

320
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:10,140
proudly displayed in the nominees this year. The
nominees for the best DC actress of 2025 are

321
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:19,060
Danielle Brooks as Leota Adebayo from Peacemaker
Season 2. I believe in miracles because of you. I

322
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:28,920
saw an eagle hug a human. I know who I am because of
you. Jenna Coleman as Johanna Constantine from

323
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:37,820
The Sandman Season 2. This is the head of Orpheus,
whose song was powerful enough to sway even the

324
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:55,130
hearts of Hades and Persephone. Jennifer Holland
as Emilia Harcourt from Peacemaker Season 2.

325
00:39:55,130 --> 00:40:13,400
Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane from Superman. All
these ladies gave strong performances, but for

326
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:19,920
some reason I want to say Jennifer Harcourt from
Peacemaker. That's my guess. The winner is Rachel

327
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:28,000
Brosnahan as Lois Lane from Superman. Well, maybe
I should have given it more thought. I loved Rachel

328
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:35,180
Brosnahan as Lois Lane. I figured, even from her
casting announcement, that she was going to be the

329
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:42,320
best Lois Lane to date, and I was not wrong. She
totally pulled off the spunk and the charm and just

330
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:49,820
the love for the character of Superman that no
other actress has been able to do as well to date. It

331
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:54,800
kind of seemed like she was plucked right out of the
Superman cartoon, which I think was probably one

332
00:40:54,800 --> 00:41:00,040
of the strongest depictions of the character in
modern times. Oh yeah, I totally agree. The fact

333
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:06,240
that she was able to help expose Lex Luthor the
villain, she really dealt him a major blow in that

334
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:12,560
film. Let's go ahead and move on to the Marvel side.
The nominees for Best Marvel Actress of 2025 are

335
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:29,400
Dominique Thorne as Ironheart in Ironheart
Season 1. Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova in

336
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:52,540
Thunderbolts. Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Contessa
Valentina Allegra da Fontaine in Thunderbolts.

337
00:41:52,540 --> 00:42:10,540
Vanessa Kirby as Invisible Woman in The Fantastic
Four First Steps. I personally would go with Julia

338
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:15,600
Louis-Dreyfus. I thought she had a standout
performance. I'm actually surprised she was on

339
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:20,880
your list for Best Villains of the Year, and I think
partially because of that you're going to give her

340
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:28,160
the win here. And the winner is Vanessa Kirby as
Invisible Woman in The Fantastic Four First

341
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:34,600
Steps. Well shit. Well much the same reason you
gave your award to Rachel Brosnihan for

342
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:39,840
exemplifying the character of Lois Lane in the
Superman movie. I'm giving it to Vanessa Kirby for

343
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:46,380
exemplifying the character of Susan Storm in The
Fantastic Four movie. Never before in all the

344
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:53,880
other iterations of Sue Storm in the other movies
have we seen this type of very grounded, very

345
00:42:53,880 --> 00:43:00,440
motherly character as we saw in First Steps. Okay,
yeah I could buy that. It was a fantastic

346
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:06,860
performance. And she had a lot to do with the role I
think. Not only did she believably serve as the

347
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:11,940
glue that holds the team together, she also
believably fought and sacrificed herself for her

348
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:17,260
kid. And I think she brought a lot of chemistry to
her role with Pedro Pascal. Vanessa Kirby just

349
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:23,020
nailed it, she crushed it. Yeah, sold, you're
right. We're moving on to our next category, Best

350
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:28,700
Actor. It's basically the same award as our last
category except these are the dudes. The

351
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:35,520
genitalia is different but the award is the same.
Exactly. There of course have been tons of great DC

352
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:40,120
and Marvel actors throughout the years. That
doesn't make the job any easier though because

353
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:45,860
these guys have to be in peak shape, they have to be
strong and charming for the most part. Yeah they

354
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:50,800
have to not only be good thespians, they have to be
stuntmen as well. Lesbians? Let's break down the

355
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:59,440
nominees. The nominees for Best Marvel Actor are
Anthony Ramos as the hood in Iron Heart Season 1. So

356
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:07,460
why are you here? I had to look you in the eye and ask
what kind of father puts his son out of the house at

357
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:13,700
12? Charlie Cox as Daredevil in Daredevil, born
again, Season 1. It occurs to me that justice will

358
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:19,780
not be served today. It won't be served because
whatever sentence is passed, foggy Nelson. We'll

359
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:27,920
still be dead. Lewis Pullman as Century in
Thunderbolts. Just like the rest of them. I'm not

360
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:37,020
afraid of you Robert. It's not Robert, you need to
be free of him. Pedro Pascal as Mr. Fantastic in The

361
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:42,260
Fantastic Four First Steps. L is the load, R is the
lever arm connected to the load, Archimedes the

362
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:48,840
law of levers. Give me a lever and a place to stand
and I will move the earth. For me, this is a toss up

363
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:56,460
either between Lewis Pullman or Pedro Pascal. But
I got to say, I think I was more surprised by Lewis

364
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:04,680
Pullman's performance and how good that was. So
he's my guess. And the winner is Lewis Pullman as

365
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:12,440
Century in Thunderbolts. Noice, nailed it. Yeah,
I was totally unsure about Lewis Pullman when he

366
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:19,300
was cast and replaced Stephen Yon as Bob in the
Thunderbolts movie. The dude fucking nailed it

367
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:25,220
though. He pulled off the psychosis, the
vulnerability, the threat that the character

368
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:31,200
posed in such a deep, emotional and convincing
way. I had to give it to the guy. It was a complex

369
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:38,060
role. Oh for sure. And honestly, I'm not sure how
Stephen Yon or literally any other actor could

370
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:42,760
have pulled it off as well as Lewis Pullman. I'm
sure he could have. But at that point, Stephen Yon

371
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:48,920
probably would have won this award. It's next to be
him, as I mentioned in our review of the movie.

372
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:58,040
Probably. But let's move on to the DC side. The
nominees for best DC actor of 2025 are David Corn

373
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:06,980
Sweat as Superman in Superman. That is being
human. And that's my greatest strength. And

374
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:13,960
someday, I hope for the sake of the world, you
understand that. David Harbour as Frankenstein

375
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:20,320
in Creature Commandos season one. That would
bring balance to life, they would say. No one would

376
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:31,660
say that. I would say that. I want. Am I not someone?
John Cena as Peacemaker in Peacemaker season two.

377
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:37,140
I can't get your fucking break. He ends up in the
land of goodness and light with a brother who's

378
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:45,380
still alive and a father who fucking loves him. The
good us. Tom Sturridge as Morpheus in Sandman

379
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:56,140
season two. You've made your choice. Just as your
life is your own. So tell us your death. I think it's

380
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:02,240
going to be a toss up between John Cena and
Morpheus. I'm going to go John Cena. That's my

381
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:13,720
guess. The winner is David Corn Sweat as Superman
in Superman. Damn it. That was so off. Now, there

382
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:20,340
was not a bad choice. I think John Cena probably
gave the best performance of his career in

383
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:27,180
Peacemaker season two. That said, David Corn
Sweat, in my opinion, is the best actor to play

384
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:32,480
Superman since Christopher Reeve. And that's a
really high bar. I think he's better in the role

385
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:38,180
than Henry Cavill, Brandon Routh, Tyler Hochlin,
better than anyone else to play the role. Because I

386
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:43,840
thought he nailed both Clark Kent and Superman
better than most. Now, is that due to the writing

387
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:49,940
you think or is that because of the performance? I
think it's both. I think James Gunn is really good

388
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:55,740
at casting for his style of writing. Because I
would say that, like, for example, Henry Cavill

389
00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:01,420
gave a great performance as Superman. He was just a
very different characterization of Superman.

390
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:06,200
Fair. But also, I don't think there was enough
differentiation between his Superman and Clark

391
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:11,920
Kent. Maybe intentionally so. And there should be
because that's from the source material. Clark

392
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:19,600
Kent acts differently from Superman. Superman is
sort of the wish fulfillment idealized version of

393
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:25,720
Clark Kent, whereas Clark Kent is supposed to be
meek and mild mannered. Makes sense. Let's go to

394
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:32,520
move into the penultimate category this evening
for the Brothers Awards. And that is Best Marvel

395
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:37,380
Series or Special. There weren't any specials
that came out this year. We haven't had one since

396
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:43,160
Werewolf by Night. We're supposed to get another
special next year with The Punisher. So this is

397
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:49,200
basically the best series award for 2025. I think
we've said this before in previous award shows,

398
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:54,500
but this award, I think, becomes more and more
important every year as we get better and better

399
00:48:54,500 --> 00:49:00,920
quality television series that rival and even
sometimes outperform the quality of what we're

400
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:07,500
seeing in theaters. Oh, yeah. Comics are a long
form storytelling medium. So it's no surprise

401
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:13,520
that their stories would be better translated to a
long form medium like a television series. The

402
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:18,600
production value on these things, like you
mentioned, continues to improve. And I'm pretty

403
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:27,100
excited about this year's nominees. The nominees
for the best DC series of 2025 are Creature

404
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:54,680
Commandos Season 1. Harley Quinn Season 5.
Peacemaker Season 2. The Sandman Season 2. Uh,

405
00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:03,920
Sandman Season 2 final answer. The winner is...
The Sandman Season 2. Of course it was. It was so

406
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,400
freaking good. I was worried about it. I'm not
going to lie. I was worried about it about how they

407
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:13,320
were going to close out the show, but they did it
perfectly, in my opinion. I mean, they condensed

408
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:20,160
so much material into just like 12 episodes, but
they did a really good job in the translation from

409
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:24,960
print to screen, I think, and staying on track with
the character of Dream. Everything. Everything

410
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:30,580
from the casting, the performances, to the music,
to the direction, to, you're right, the

411
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:37,020
adaptation of the story. I feel like it should have
been harder to pull off, but they did it in just a

412
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:43,660
masterpiece of a season and really a show. I mean,
the Sandman series is one of modern literature's

413
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:50,700
greatest tragedies, and Season 2 was a lot more
heavy on the tragedy aspect of it. And I remember

414
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:56,480
being devastated watching it. If I'm ever put in a
situation where I only get to watch one television

415
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:01,600
series again for the rest of my life, I'm choosing
the Sandman. Both seasons. Really? Interesting.

416
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:06,620
Hell yeah. You think you'd pick something with
more seasons, though? That's fair. I'd probably

417
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:11,420
go like Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad or
something. You know what? No, I'm going to stand by

418
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:15,120
it. I'll stick with the Sandman. It's pretty
varied. You're probably still safe with that

419
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:21,580
choice. But let's go to move on to Marvel. The
nominations for the best Marvel series of 2025 are

420
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:42,460
Daredevil, Born Again, Season 1 Iron Heart,
Season 1 Marvel Zombies, Season 1 Your friendly

421
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:52,280
neighborhood Spider-Man, Season 1 I think this
one's obvious. I think it's Daredevil, Born

422
00:51:52,280 --> 00:52:02,040
Again. And the winner is Marvel Zombies, Season 1
Well, I didn't watch it, so how would I know? Marvel

423
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:10,100
Zombies was fucking everything that I wanted it to
be. Now, it wasn't an adaptation of the comic book

424
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:15,980
story of Marvel Zombies, which largely takes
place after the zombie apocalypse has happened

425
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:22,540
and we see the state of all these Marvel heroes as
zombies. The show was more about survival and it

426
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:29,240
had a great kickoff with the What If episode. This
carried on and told a truly harrowing and

427
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:35,960
horrifying story. The main characters were
Kamala Khan, Miss Marvel, and Shang-Chi, as well

428
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:41,060
as featuring a version of Blade that was like
amalgamated with Moon Knight. So it kind of felt

429
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:46,120
like the Avengers movie that we're probably never
going to get with all those new characters. But it

430
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:53,320
was funny and it was violent, and I think it was
everything that it needed to be in a way more so than

431
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:58,240
these other shows were. Now, in all honesty, I
actually almost gave this award to your friendly

432
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:03,100
neighborhood Spider-Man because I really came
around on that show, especially in the latter half

433
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:08,320
of Season 1. Not only did it tell some of the best
origin stories for Spider-Man's villains,

434
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:14,440
probably ever when the story wasn't bogged down by
teenage drama or whatever. The show was really

435
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:20,120
well done, but in the end, I think it kind of tied for
Daredevil born again in terms of my enjoyment of

436
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:25,620
it, whereas Marvel Zombies, I had a blast from
start to finish. And Marvel Zombies was a

437
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:31,920
mini-series, right? It was only, what, like six
episodes? Four episodes. Oh, wow. Talk about

438
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,860
getting banged for your buck. Yeah, you should
watch it next Halloween season. I highly

439
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:40,420
recommend it if you haven't seen it. If you like
Zombie Fair, I think a lot of people will probably

440
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:46,180
not be thrilled that it stars some lesser-known
Marvel characters, but if you're a fan of Kamala

441
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:51,740
Khan like I am, like I loved the Miss Marvel
television series, and I thought Amon Valani was

442
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:57,820
one of the strongest parts of the Marvels movie. If
you loved Shang-Chi like I did, if you're really

443
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:02,880
looking forward to seeing what Blade will be like,
or if you loved Moon Knight, yeah, just watch

444
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:08,700
Marvel Zombies. But also, I would recommend
watching the Marvel Zombies episode of What If

445
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:13,000
first, and then going into the Marvel Zombies
season. Really, it's a five-episode season,

446
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:18,620
because that first What If episode is crucial.
Gotcha. Okay, good advice. Moving on to our final

447
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:26,260
category of the show of the year. Best motion
picture. Best film, really. Yeah, no one calls

448
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:32,080
them motion pictures anymore, except for the
Oscars. This award is, again, basically like the

449
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:38,180
previous award, just with, again, different
genitalia. Couldn't have said it better myself.

450
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:45,320
No, Joseph and I are huge movie fans. It's one of the
reasons we started this podcast. I love going to

451
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:50,760
the theaters, and I'm glad to see more and more
people continuing to do so after the pandemic.

452
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:55,220
Come on, that was five years ago, people. Let's get
our asses back in the theaters. My ass loves my

453
00:54:55,220 --> 00:55:01,320
couch, though. That's loser talk, bro. Get out
there, lazy bastard. Honestly, the movie theater

454
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:06,260
seats in the theaters near me are like leather and
reclining now. It's great. It's way more

455
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:11,520
comfortable than my couch. All right, then. But
anyway, there's nothing quite like experiencing

456
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:18,700
a story on a massive screen with a bunch of people.
Let's break down the nominees. The nominees for

457
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:35,880
Best Marvel Picture of 2025 are Captain America,
Brave New World. The Fantastic Four First Steps.

458
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:47,820
Thunderbolts. And that's it. Just three nominees
for Marvel. Well, of those easily hands down, I

459
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:56,260
would say my favorite was Fantastic Four First
Steps. So that's my guess. And the winner is...

460
00:55:56,260 --> 00:56:04,620
Thunderbolts. That would have been my second
guess. You lose. I win. I don't know what I win. No,

461
00:56:04,620 --> 00:56:09,680
Thunderbolts was every bit as good as the
Fantastic Four First Steps in terms of my

462
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:14,760
enjoyment of them. They were very different
movies. The difference being that Thunderbolts

463
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:21,340
had something to say, which is not entirely common
among films in this genre. Fantastic Four looked

464
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:27,760
amazing, had great art direction, truly brought
the heroes to life on the big screen in a way that

465
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:34,440
other attempts failed. But Thunderbolts, I
think, is the best type of movie for the superhero

466
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:40,580
genre in that it really brought more to the table
than just spectacle in action. It was more of a

467
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:45,660
psychological exploration. And it was funny. And
it's still delivered on the action. Yes,

468
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:51,540
psychological thrillers are some of my favorite
films of all time. I really liked the Thunderbolts

469
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:57,520
when it came out. In fact, I called it my favorite
Marvel film up until that point. And so Fantastic

470
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:03,560
Four came out, which I started calling that my
favorite Marvel film up until that point. But only

471
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:08,780
because I think I cared about the characters a
little bit more. And I think the filmmaking was a

472
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:12,880
little better in terms of, you know,
cinematography and stuff like that. But that's

473
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:18,720
not to discount Thunderbolts. It was a really cool
movie, really well done movie, a little bit

474
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:25,220
smaller in scope. But I agree with you that I
appreciate that it had a message. Yes, scope isn't

475
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:29,820
everything. Yeah, you compare the scope of these
two films and they couldn't be more different. But

476
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:35,480
I think what also contributed to my ultimate
decision was that the first act and the latter part

477
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:40,260
of the second act of the Fantastic Four movie were
too montagey. There was too much dicing and

478
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:44,760
slicing in the editing room for the Fantastic Four
first steps, whereas that was not the case for

479
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:50,120
Thunderbolts. That's fair. Yeah, that's a fair
criticism for sure. Made it harder to connect with

480
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:55,460
the characters than it should have been. Whereas
it was surprisingly easy to connect with C tier

481
00:57:55,460 --> 00:58:00,440
characters that appeared in the Thunderbolts.
Right. Good choice. Good choice. I'm glad you went

482
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:07,860
with that choice. But moving on to DC, also just
three nominees. The nominees for the best DC

483
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:25,480
picture of 2025 are Aztec Batman, Clash of
Empires. Batman Ninja versus Yakuza League.

484
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:38,360
Superman. Superman, obviously. Final answer.
The winner is Aztec Batman, Clash of Clans. I'm

485
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:47,800
just joking. Bullshit. The winner is Superman. It
was an easy choice. As much as I really liked Batman

486
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:52,360
Ninja versus Yakuza League, I had to go with
Superman. It was just a better experience

487
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:59,040
overall. An exciting experience as it kicked off
James Gunn's DCU. It was a terrific Superman film

488
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:05,560
with all of the heart and hope and goodness that you
want out of a Superman movie. In a way that I feel

489
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:12,140
like we haven't had in a really long time. The
music, the score, the story, the performances,

490
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:17,980
all commendable. I just really loved this film.
And I'm not the only one. I can't tell you how many

491
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:24,120
Instagram reels I've seen of people just loving on
the Superman movie. Just going home and feeling

492
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:29,720
good about being a punk rocker or wanting to be a
punk rocker like Superman, who's extremely nice

493
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:35,640
and sees the good in everyone. It's a great message
for a Superman film to have in particular. First of

494
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:42,420
all, Superman isn't punk rock as much as he wants to
claim that he is. He's the new punk rock. Second of

495
00:59:42,420 --> 00:59:46,800
all, I totally beat you at this year's Brothers
Awards. I just want you to know that I know it's not

496
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:52,160
like an actual competition, but I won in terms of
our guesses. Oh, wait, wait, what are we keeping

497
00:59:52,160 --> 01:00:00,140
score now? Is this some kind of contest? Yes. What
was the score? I don't know. Okay. Third of all,

498
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:06,220
yes, Superman was a good movie. It was fine. I don't
think he compared to Thunderbolts. And frankly,

499
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:12,260
I'm tired of hearing about Superman. Well, that's
just Hater talk. Hater. Hater's going to hate. And

500
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:17,600
I guess you'll be doing given more hating next year
because we'll be discussing Supergirl. Yeah, I'm

501
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:22,500
already not looking forward to it, but thankfully
I'll be able to go at least a few precious months

502
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:31,100
without hearing you talk about Superman. Cause
I'm a punk rocker. Yes, I am. Okay. But that does it

503
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:35,840
