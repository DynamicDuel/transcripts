00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,957
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,494 --> 00:00:29,536
Welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:35,478
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:42,762
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous
Joe. And welcome to episode 400. Normally,

5
00:00:42,822 --> 00:00:48,144
we would be doing a team duel on an anniversary
episode such as this, but Marvel

6
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:55,799
all at once at the end of summer. So we're getting
caught up on some reviews, one of them being

7
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:03,342
Suicide Squad Isekai. Yeah, our next episode
is gonna be the Outsiders versus X-Force. That'll

8
00:01:03,362 --> 00:01:09,585
be our team duel. But first we get to talk anime
with our good buddy Zach Hepburn from the Senjou

9
00:01:09,605 --> 00:01:13,607
World Podcast, which is part of the Dynamite
Podcast Network. We'll get him on the line

10
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:18,188
later on this episode. Right, he's gonna help
us review Suicide Squad Isekai. It's a pretty

11
00:01:18,228 --> 00:01:22,380
fun anime, and we're gonna talk all about it
later on. There's no comic book movie news

12
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,186
to break down this week. As always, we list
our segment times in our episode description,

00:03:37,998 --> 00:03:44,422
But with that out of the way, quick to the No
Prize! A No Prize is an award Marvel used to

38
00:03:44,442 --> 00:03:49,664
give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel
No Prize, is a digital award we post on Instagram

39
00:03:49,684 --> 00:03:54,507
for the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. Last week we asked,

40
00:03:54,627 --> 00:04:00,090
who do you think was the best cast Marvel or
DC villain of all time? And of course, this

41
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:05,154
was coming off the news that James Spader is
returning to voice Ultron for the upcoming

42
00:04:05,214 --> 00:04:10,318
Disney Plus Vision television series. We got
a whole lot of answers this time, nine answers

43
00:04:10,358 --> 00:04:14,822
total. So it's always heartbreaking when that
happens because I feel like we let so many

44
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:19,186
people down by not choosing their answer for
an honorable mention. But you guys all gave

45
00:04:19,226 --> 00:04:23,449
great answers. Let's go ahead and break down
this week's honorable mentions before revealing

46
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:30,730
the no prize winner. Our first honorable mention
goes to Scott Camacho. Who said? On the DC

47
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,713
side of things, it's easy. Heath Ledger's Joker
cannot be beat. I mean, you, if you look at

48
00:04:35,813 --> 00:04:42,197
every other Joker iteration, all of them are
still trying to get a piece of Heath Ledger's

49
00:04:42,217 --> 00:04:48,901
shadow, but for the Marvel side of things, nothing
can be Tom Hiddleston's Loki. What RDJ was

50
00:04:48,941 --> 00:04:55,644
for Iron Man, Tom Hiddleston was for Loki. Everyone
else, every villain can be replaced, but Tom's

51
00:04:55,684 --> 00:05:01,396
Loki remains the And he got caught off at the
end right there. But yeah, Tom Hiddleston's

52
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:06,500
Loki, I think, is the best villain in terms
of casting for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

53
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,744
He had such a good story leading from the first
Thor film all the way through Loki season two.

54
00:05:12,065 --> 00:05:16,348
And I hope it's not done. I hope Tom Hiddleston
comes back to the role and we see him in future

55
00:05:16,388 --> 00:05:22,093
Marvel stories. You better because he's a great
actor and he's perfect in the role. As was

56
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:28,590
Heath Ledger as the Joker. It was a ground so
much. I'm sorry. What? Not really. Shut the

57
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:35,157
hell up. His performance was groundbreaking.
It was a tour de force, playing one of the

58
00:05:35,197 --> 00:05:40,502
most iconic villains of all time. He won an
Oscar for the role. And even with Joaquin Phoenix

59
00:05:40,642 --> 00:05:46,128
also winning an Oscar for playing the Joker,
Heath Ledger arguably is still the best actor

60
00:05:46,168 --> 00:05:52,134
to do it. So great answer Scotty. Our next honorable
mention goes to Kat Stevenson. Who said? Hi

61
00:05:52,174 --> 00:05:57,919
guys, it's Kat again, and I think the most legendary
casting for a villain in Marvel or DC is Josh

62
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:03,986
Brolin as Thanos. Nobody else would be able
to bring the gravitas and might needed for

63
00:06:04,006 --> 00:06:10,232
a character such as Thanos. His delivery of
lines is so powerful and moving, there's nobody

64
00:06:10,352 --> 00:06:16,382
else that could do it. Even if the character
is entirely CGI, he is the character. Yeah,

65
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:22,924
Josh Brolin's performance as Thanos was exemplary,
particularly in the world of motion capture

66
00:06:22,964 --> 00:06:29,467
animation. Yes, the character of Thanos was
an all CG character in the movies, but so much

67
00:06:29,527 --> 00:06:35,429
of Brolin's performance showed through, which
made Thanos feel so lifelike and real. And

68
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:41,412
the visual effects team did a great job. Obviously,
so did Josh Brolin, and he will always be remembered

69
00:06:41,592 --> 00:06:46,910
as that character of Thanos. Yeah, I'm still
surprised by how he played the character. Like

70
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:52,112
I remember reading comics with Thanos in it
and I always thought he was much more maniacal.

71
00:06:52,152 --> 00:06:57,794
But Josh Brolin played a much more subdued version
of the character to his benefit, I think, because

72
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:03,417
I think he made him sympathetic in a way that
I never really found Thanos to be. And in that

73
00:07:03,477 --> 00:07:07,878
sense, I think he kind of elevated the character
with his performance. For sure. He made him

74
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:13,961
believable. He made him feel real. Great answer,
Kat. Our next honorable mention goes to Caleb

75
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:22,076
Falk, who said, Hey guys, Caleb Volk here and
I think the best casting for a Marvel or DC

76
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:28,702
villain has to be Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin,
not only in the original Spider-Man trilogy,

77
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:37,471
but also coming back 20 years later and playing
the same character just as well, if not better

78
00:07:38,312 --> 00:07:42,890
in the Spider-Man No Way Home movie. I think
I've said this a few times in our reviews of

79
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:48,133
the Spider-Man films, Willem Dafoe is perfect
casting as the Green Goblin because he has

80
00:07:48,173 --> 00:07:53,975
a natural goblin face. I mean, not only that,
the guy is a fantastic actor, not the best

81
00:07:54,075 --> 00:08:00,358
looking, but appropriately so for a character
like the Green Goblin. I'm so glad that Kevin

82
00:08:00,398 --> 00:08:05,680
Feige did not try and recast the character for
the MCU because, yeah, you cannot do better

83
00:08:05,981 --> 00:08:12,179
than Willem Dafoe for Norman Osborn. He's so
unbelievably sinister and maniacal. He was

84
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:17,400
born to play the role. For sure, for sure. So
good answer, Caleb. We want to give a huge

85
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:23,662
shout out to Cyrus Moore, Jacob Bell, John Storosky,
Mickey Manteghian, and Waldo for taking the

86
00:08:23,682 --> 00:08:28,383
time to visit our website and leave us an answer.
But the winner of this week's snow prize is

87
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:33,445
Travis Bailey, who said, Travis Bailey here.
What's going on, fella? Shout out to my good

88
00:08:33,465 --> 00:08:38,742
twin. Man, it's been too long. All right, look.
You're going to get like four or five different

89
00:08:38,762 --> 00:08:43,945
jokers. You're going to get Kingpin. I hope
you'll get a Scarlet Witch for sure. Let's

90
00:08:43,965 --> 00:08:50,568
talk about it. But it's Ian McKellen. It's Magneto
Ian McKellen. Iconic. I mean, unassailable

91
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:57,291
casting. Him and Professor X. Look, that whole
franchise was just hot toilet water. But they

92
00:08:57,331 --> 00:09:03,182
got those two right. For sure. For sure. I think
Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. can largely

93
00:09:03,222 --> 00:09:08,968
be credited with giving validity to the whole
superhero genre, as they did back in the year

94
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:14,072
2000 with the movie X-Men. I think before their
casting, superhero movies were largely seen

95
00:09:14,212 --> 00:09:21,879
as juvenile stuff, kids' fair, blade notwithstanding,
but when X-Men suddenly cast these two Shakespearean

96
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:28,265
actors who so perfectly embodied their roles
and manifested them in such a way that elevated

97
00:09:28,325 --> 00:09:33,409
it. from the page. I think a lot of people stood
up and took notice and the genre owes a big

98
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:38,293
debt to Ian McKellen, I think, for helping get
this whole thing started really. Yeah, I mean,

99
00:09:38,313 --> 00:09:44,719
you could say that Jack Nicholson and Danny
DeVito were amazing as, you know, Joker and

100
00:09:44,739 --> 00:09:49,242
the Penguin and you would be right, but they
also had a degree of comic book camp to their

101
00:09:49,282 --> 00:09:55,327
performances. Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart
played their roles, like you mentioned, as

102
00:09:55,387 --> 00:10:02,129
if they were basically Shakespearean When they
first made the movie, they were master thespians

103
00:10:02,329 --> 00:10:07,954
at the top of their craft, and they'll always
be remembered, at least to me, as those characters

104
00:10:08,114 --> 00:10:12,278
in those iconic roles. So congrats to Travis
Bailey for winning this week's No Prize. If

105
00:10:12,318 --> 00:10:16,202
you the listener want a shot at winning your
own No Prize, stay tuned to later on this episode

106
00:10:16,222 --> 00:10:21,126

Week. And now that that's done, NOT ON TO THE

107
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:24,629
NEWS, because there's no news. So we're just

So with that out of the way, now let's move
on to the main event of this episode and get

115
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:18,229
Senjoworld's Zachary Hepburn on the line to
help us review the DC animated series, Suicide

116
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:18,929
Squad Isekai.

117
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:41,349
Alright, Suicide Squad Isekai is a 10 episode
anime series produced by Wit Studio, the same

118
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:47,272
anime studio that produced the first three seasons
of Attack on Titan, which I have not seen but

119
00:11:47,352 --> 00:11:53,916
I hear is incredible. Joseph and I are definitely
not as well versed in anime as we are in comics,

120
00:11:54,396 --> 00:12:00,359
so to help us out in our spoiler review, we've
enlisted our resident anime guru and the host

121
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:00,579
of the

122
00:12:04,758 --> 00:12:10,302
Zachary Hepburn. How's it going, Zach? Good,
good. It's it's good to be back. It's good

123
00:12:10,322 --> 00:12:14,105
to be back and finally doing a review with you
guys. Yeah, we haven't had you on the show

124
00:12:14,205 --> 00:12:19,269
since you and John reviewed Spider-Man, the
amazing Spider-Man with us. Yeah, that was

125
00:12:19,289 --> 00:12:23,573
a couple of years ago. So, yeah, I'm excited
to be back. I love being part of the group,

126
00:12:23,713 --> 00:12:27,896
part of the family. Yeah, it's great to have
you as a part of that family, especially for

127
00:12:27,936 --> 00:12:33,581
this episode, because I know you love anime.
You, like I said, are the expert in it in our

128
00:12:33,741 --> 00:12:38,599
group. I have to ask, when you first learned
that they were going to make a Suicide Squad

129
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:45,282
anime, what did you think? When they first announced
it, I was like, really? Suicide Squad? Because

130
00:12:45,683 --> 00:12:51,745
at that time, it was everything was Suicide
Squad, right? So the video game? Yeah, I was

131
00:12:51,785 --> 00:12:58,048
just like, the video game let us down. But this,
I don't know, I found this redeemed it for

132
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:03,834
me, redeem the Suicide Squad. Really? That's
pretty cool. So in regards to Wit Studio, the

133
00:13:03,954 --> 00:13:09,076
producers of Suicide Squad, Isakai, they did
the first three seasons of Attack on Titan.

134
00:13:09,436 --> 00:13:13,497
Have you seen those seasons? Like, are you familiar
with Wit Studio? And did their involvement

135
00:13:13,517 --> 00:13:19,738
get you excited at all for Suicide Squad? To
be honest, I'm not really a guy who pays attention

136
00:13:19,778 --> 00:13:27,120
to what studio is doing what. I just enjoy anime,
but I am familiar with Attack on Titan. I never

137
00:13:27,161 --> 00:13:31,934
finished it, but I watched like the second last
movie they put out. So I just have to go and

138
00:13:31,954 --> 00:13:37,179
finish it. So I am pretty well-versed in the
world of Attack on Titan. I'm not the biggest

139
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:41,982
fan, which hence why I haven't finished it.
But it is good. It has a kind of a messed up

140
00:13:42,002 --> 00:13:46,686
story. So I don't know. It's kind of dark. And
if you're into that kind of thing, then...

141
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:51,610
There's a few animes that I've been meaning
to check out, especially since you started

142
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:57,175
your show. Attack on Titan is one of those.
Yeah, it's just so hard with having this podcast

143
00:13:57,195 --> 00:14:00,537
and having to watch all the stuff that we're
currently in the middle of having to watch.

144
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,941
including this one. Although I was looking forward
to this one. Like when I first learned that

145
00:14:04,961 --> 00:14:10,747
they were making a Suicide Squad anime series,
I was pretty pumped because like the idea of

146
00:14:10,787 --> 00:14:16,051
the Suicide Squad, these super powered prisoners
forced to carry out these impossible missions

147
00:14:16,512 --> 00:14:23,458
lends itself to a very like pulpy and formulaic
format like anime where the goal isn't marketability

148
00:14:23,518 --> 00:14:29,551
so much as cheaply giving the audiences what
they want. The almost Tarantino-esque approach

149
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:35,934
that James Gunn took with 2021's The Suicide
Squad film, after successful DC animes like

150
00:14:35,974 --> 00:14:43,038
Batman Ninja and My Adventures with Superman,
I was so ready for a hard-edged Suicide Squad

151
00:14:43,078 --> 00:14:48,521
series that could up the maturity level to match
some of my favorite anime series like Neon

152
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:58,371
Genesis Evangelion or Sword Art Online, which
I believe fits within the Sword Art? Yes, technically,

153
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:04,034
but that one was all virtual and it was a video
game. And Isekai's literally people are sucked

154
00:15:04,154 --> 00:15:10,018
into another world. Yeah, if the listeners are
not familiar with Isekai, the word literally

155
00:15:10,058 --> 00:15:15,961
means another world in Japanese and refers to
like the new, often fantastical world that

156
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:20,324
the story's main characters find themselves
in and have to learn to navigate. The only

157
00:15:20,364 --> 00:15:26,527
Isekai I think I've seen is Sword Art. but I've
heard the most popular is Re Zero, which was

158
00:15:26,587 --> 00:15:33,270
written by Tape Nagusuki, I'm mispronouncing
that I'm sure, but he was the lead writer on

159
00:15:33,331 --> 00:15:39,053
Suicide Squad, Isekai as well. Now, the premise
of the Suicide Squad operating in a fantasy

160
00:15:39,213 --> 00:15:44,216
Isekai land is pretty absurd, but that didn't
really bother me because I feel like the concept

161
00:15:44,236 --> 00:15:49,822
of the Suicide Squad thrives in absurdity. And
it's not like we haven't seen other comic book

162
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:54,484
characters like Batman or Captain America in
medieval fantasy settings before. The fantasy

163
00:15:54,504 --> 00:16:00,267
world this series sets up is kind of confusing,
I think, but it's essentially one where a kingdom

164
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:07,129
of humans is warring against an empire of orcs
and human animal hybrids known as demi humans.

165
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:13,292
There are elves and dragons. It's basically
World of Warcraft, I feel. Yes, it's definitely

166
00:16:13,392 --> 00:16:20,331
fantasy magic and not just kind of like medieval.
Yeah, this was definitely my thing. Like I

167
00:16:20,371 --> 00:16:26,213
love swords. Give me swords magic all day. Yeah,
like swords and sorcery adventures. Those are

168
00:16:26,273 --> 00:16:31,635
awesome. I love those, too. And you put anime
with it. It's just like the best thing ever

169
00:16:31,655 --> 00:16:36,578
for me. So it's always cool to see like familiar
characters in a new setting like that, like

170
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:42,180
Dark Knights of Steel, that comic series that's
going on right now for D.C. seeing what Roman

171
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:48,718
and Batman in these magical swords and sorcery
settings. I love that. There are certain things

172
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:53,821
that draw me in. And if the characters are badass,
if the fights are badass, if the power sets

173
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:59,003
are badass, I'm all for it. Which they definitely
had a lot of that here. I thought it was pretty

174
00:16:59,023 --> 00:17:04,365
interesting what they did with a lot of the
characters. But the story for this series is

175
00:17:04,405 --> 00:17:09,567
essentially that Amanda Waller wants to plunder
the Isekai's resources on behalf of the US

176
00:17:09,587 --> 00:17:15,549
government. So she sends suicide squads in to
establish a framework with which to do that.

177
00:17:16,086 --> 00:17:21,109
The first squad she sent ended up defecting
and helping the Empire. So she sent a second

178
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:25,972
one to do the first one's job. But they ended
up siding with the kingdom against the Empire

179
00:17:26,092 --> 00:17:31,816
and the other squad. It's actually a pretty
cool Suicide Squad versus Suicide Squad premise

180
00:17:32,296 --> 00:17:36,999
and one that allows us to see an expanded roster
of DC supervillains that I didn't think we

181
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:42,786
were going to get to see in the show. Yes, I
love the cast. Like I always want most of those

182
00:17:42,826 --> 00:17:48,167
characters that were in this to be on one team
with each other. So just to even just have

183
00:17:48,187 --> 00:17:53,329
them face off, just be in the same series. I
loved it. I loved it. Yeah. Like there's been

184
00:17:53,669 --> 00:17:57,790
times in the comics where like the Suicide Squad
goes up against the Justice League. But to

185
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:02,031
have a Suicide Squad go up against another one
is just a really cool concept. I thought there

186
00:18:02,051 --> 00:18:08,953
were going to be more deaths on one side, but
it was pretty much all on the first squad.

187
00:18:09,494 --> 00:18:14,695
But the characters were awesome. I think the
coolest thing about the show was the designs

188
00:18:14,715 --> 00:18:19,056
that came up with for the DC characters. And
this was something like we noticed even from

189
00:18:19,076 --> 00:18:24,938
the trailers. Like Harley Quinn was a character
tailor made to be in anime. She looked fantastic

190
00:18:25,318 --> 00:18:30,759
and very much like an amalgam of Margot Robbie's
looks from the two Suicide Squad films. Yeah,

191
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:36,681
I have to say, Isakai Harley is probably my
favorite version of Harley Quinn ever. I agree.

192
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:41,174
The way she talks like... Oh, here's the question
for you guys. Did you watch it in English or

193
00:18:41,194 --> 00:18:47,496
did you watch it in Japanese? I started to watch
in English, but I had a hard time getting through

194
00:18:47,576 --> 00:18:52,518
some of the line deliveries. For some reason,
I just think sometimes things sound better

195
00:18:52,738 --> 00:18:57,880
in Japanese. So I switched over to Japanese
within the first few minutes, and I stayed

196
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:02,561
with that the rest of the way through. I thought
the voice performances were great in Japanese.

197
00:19:02,961 --> 00:19:09,990
No, they were amazing. Same, I started the first
10 minutes in English and some of the translations

198
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:15,994
from Japanese to English don't always work that
well. I find that I can much easier accept

199
00:19:16,034 --> 00:19:20,637
the dialogue when it's being read in the native
language it was written because I think it

200
00:19:20,657 --> 00:19:25,961
just carries a slightly different context language
to language. And yeah, it's just more digestible

201
00:19:26,001 --> 00:19:31,765
I think in Japanese. I agree, totally. There
are some very good English voice actors, but...

202
00:19:32,194 --> 00:19:36,736
When it comes down to it, I find they just can't
beat the Japanese ones because there's so much

203
00:19:36,776 --> 00:19:41,818
passion. They love what they do. Yeah, and it's
not even just the acting. It's also the writing.

204
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:47,060
Like a voice actor can only do so much if the
translator didn't do a good job of translating,

205
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,902
you know, and so then all of a sudden they're
being fed corny lines. For sure. And so the

206
00:19:51,922 --> 00:19:56,785
reason I was asking that, I was curious if there
was swearing in the English version because

207
00:19:57,105 --> 00:20:01,371
I didn't watch the English either. There was
swearing, yeah. Sometimes, I don't know why,

208
00:20:01,511 --> 00:20:06,754
I'd go to a next episode and HBO Max would default
to English. So I'd hear part of the episode

209
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:11,537
before I managed to switch over, and yeah, there
was cussing. Okay, okay. I just wanted to make

210
00:20:11,557 --> 00:20:15,940
sure because I was like, this show, like, I
love the way Harley Quinn talks, and if they

211
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,923
didn't kind of do it the same in English, it's
just not justice. So if you watch it in English,

212
00:20:21,183 --> 00:20:26,650
watch it again in Japanese. It's so much better.
Absolutely. For sure, yeah. I have to say though,

213
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:31,352
the versions of these characters are definitely
my favorite versions of them. I think it's

214
00:20:31,372 --> 00:20:36,974
because they borrowed the best parts from the
two Suicide Squad films. Even in the roster,

215
00:20:37,214 --> 00:20:42,616
mixing them from both versions. You had Deadshot,
Katana, Enchantress Killer Croc, and Joker

216
00:20:42,636 --> 00:20:46,897
from the first film. And then you had King Shark,
Peacemaker, Ratcatcher, and the Thinker from

217
00:20:46,937 --> 00:20:52,088
the second. Clayface was really the only original
one in this show, though you could say he was

218
00:20:52,128 --> 00:20:57,112
borrowed from his supporting role in the Harley
Quinn animated series. He's very much a thespian

219
00:20:57,132 --> 00:21:01,836
with delusions of grandeur in that show. And
in this series, they kind of ran with that

220
00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:08,681
while adding a bit of otaku fanboy for expository
purposes and a more hip aesthetic. Yeah, for

221
00:21:08,721 --> 00:21:13,324
sure. I do want to talk about the animation
quality. I thought it kept pace with the character

222
00:21:13,344 --> 00:21:19,118
designs. I think this is... probably the best
animated work DC has put out this year for

223
00:21:19,158 --> 00:21:25,380
sure. And it may be the best animated project
DC has ever put out in terms of animation quality.

224
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,602
I thought it was better than Batman Ninja. I
agree. Yeah, because Batman Ninja was computer

225
00:21:30,642 --> 00:21:35,083
animated. It wasn't hand drawn. And I believe
the show was hand drawn. It looked great, I

226
00:21:35,123 --> 00:21:41,685
thought. This show had amazing choreography
when it came to the fights. Like some of the

227
00:21:41,725 --> 00:21:50,588
fights, I was just like, holy crap, DC, like
You can do this? Like, what? Like, oh my God.

228
00:21:50,928 --> 00:21:56,510
Did you have a favorite fight? It was definitely
Harley Quinn when she was going to fight the

229
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:01,672
Thinker. Yes, that was mine too. That was cool.
And against Katana too, right after that. That

230
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:06,474
was pretty good. Oh my God, that's what I mean.
She is my favorite version. Like, she can like

231
00:22:06,554 --> 00:22:12,316
fight. Like, that's the crazy thing, yeah. I
gotta say, Zach, hearing from you that you

232
00:22:12,336 --> 00:22:17,659
thought the choreography in this show was good,
knowing how big of a fan of anime you are and

233
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:22,121
how much you watch and also having a martial
arts background yourself. That is high, high

234
00:22:22,161 --> 00:22:27,683
praise, I gotta say. It does its thing. Like,
it is so good. I was just blown away by it.

235
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:32,486
I was just like, I can't believe DC's putting
out this kind of quality martial arts. And

236
00:22:32,546 --> 00:22:38,368
I was just like, yes, finally, we have DC anime
that clearly surpasses the Marvel anime. Let's

237
00:22:38,428 --> 00:22:43,239
do this, DC. We got this. Even better than the
animation and the show itself, I thought the

238
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:49,742
animation for the opening sequence was insanely
good. Like I rarely skipped it. There were

239
00:22:49,762 --> 00:22:53,784
a few times I did, but I just enjoyed watching
it, paired with the music that they chose and

240
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:57,626
everything like that. It really got me pumped
for every episode, for sure. Yeah, the music

241
00:22:57,747 --> 00:23:01,549
was, oh my God, like I don't know what it is,
but when I'm watching something, I always kind

242
00:23:01,569 --> 00:23:07,692
of zone out and I just don't hear the music,
right? As I stated in, you know, my Sailor

243
00:23:07,712 --> 00:23:12,798
Moon review, if it's not good, I just don't
notice it. And every time the songs were on,

244
00:23:12,998 --> 00:23:17,560
I was just like, yes, this is perfect. And I'm
like bopping out and everything about it. I

245
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:23,083
am actually blown away by how good DC did with
this project. Yeah, I didn't skip any of the

246
00:23:23,123 --> 00:23:27,484
intros either when I was watching it, partly
because of the music. But I would say I stayed

247
00:23:27,525 --> 00:23:33,247
for the end credits even more so for the end
music, because that's Maury Kaliope song is

248
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:38,269
not bad. I'm not really familiar with her work.
I know she's like a YouTube thing, whatever.

249
00:23:38,689 --> 00:23:44,974
But. Yeah, I thought it was pretty good. Now,
Mendo Waller gave me creepy vibes in the end

250
00:23:45,015 --> 00:23:48,838
music video every time. No, I loved it. When
she's grabbing her crotch and she's like, yeah,

251
00:23:48,878 --> 00:23:53,102
loosen my lips, loosen my lips. And we're like,
whoa, that's obscene. But I was like, that's

252
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:58,707
perfect for a Suicide Squad. It's perfect. It
is. Right? But it's also perfect anime. I loved

253
00:23:58,807 --> 00:24:06,098
it. Yeah, it was absurd in the best way possible.
Like meme worthy. Now, I do have to say. despite

254
00:24:06,138 --> 00:24:11,163
the show's top-notch animation and character
designs and intriguing premise. The show itself,

255
00:24:11,323 --> 00:24:19,230
to me, was kind of lackluster and boring story-wise.
Like, I thought that's partly probably to do

256
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:24,215
with the lack of stakes. Like, Suicide Squad
as a premise is supposed to contain a degree

257
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:28,739
of, like, macabre interest in finding out, you
know, who's going to die and how. But that

258
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:34,258
was completely stripped from this series. The
72 hour time limit never really felt like a

259
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:38,779
real threat because time itself was kind of
all over the place in this show. And when Amanda

260
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:43,681
Waller did trigger one of the neck bombs to
go off, of course, it was going to be Clayface,

261
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:48,562
a character that wouldn't be affected, which
I saw coming a mile away. And that wasn't the

262
00:24:48,762 --> 00:24:53,763
only obvious thing that I noticed. Princess
Fiona being confused for Harley Quinn was something

263
00:24:53,844 --> 00:24:58,905
I figured would happen as early as the trailers
for this series. I do think that this season

264
00:24:59,225 --> 00:25:03,278
probably didn't need to be 10 episodes. But
you know, as I've heard you mentioned before,

265
00:25:03,318 --> 00:25:08,421
Zach, anime is kind of known for drawn out seasons
and filler episodes. So I guess the show is

266
00:25:08,461 --> 00:25:14,844
par for the course in that regard. Most anime
actually now are doing just 12 episodes and

267
00:25:14,864 --> 00:25:20,426
the season. So I'm not gonna lie, I was a little
upset. I didn't have a little bit more, but

268
00:25:20,846 --> 00:25:24,908
I don't know. I think that's the thing with
us anime fans is we just, we want to see the

269
00:25:24,988 --> 00:25:30,767
sick animation. Like we love all the like. Like
we watch anime and like we'll go on YouTube

270
00:25:30,807 --> 00:25:35,048
and watch it slow down. That's like how like
kind of invested we are and that's how much

271
00:25:35,088 --> 00:25:40,671
we enjoy these fights that we see in anime.
It's cool that the passionate fan base exists

272
00:25:40,751 --> 00:25:45,513
out there. Cause the animators do put a lot
of like thoughts into this. You could tell

273
00:25:45,553 --> 00:25:50,335
when they do. It just looks so much better and
it's so much more fluid. Well, what it is too

274
00:25:50,435 --> 00:25:57,738
is item placement or like hand placement, right?
They do such a good job of conveying actual

275
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:02,841
martial arts and actual strikes. And, you know,
when Harley Quinn hits with the baseball bat,

276
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:07,683
it's very realistic. It's not cartoony. It looks
like, you know what I mean? Somebody's actually

277
00:26:07,703 --> 00:26:12,786
hitting somebody. Yeah. They do a very good
job of that in this for sure. Now, I'm not

278
00:26:12,826 --> 00:26:16,929
sure if Warner Brothers is planning on doing
more seasons of the show, but it definitely

279
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:23,372
feels like WIT Studio is in it for the long
call, which I also feel is like a risky move

280
00:26:23,412 --> 00:26:28,483
because, you know, we as comic book movie fans.
are well aware of how often superhero projects

281
00:26:28,563 --> 00:26:33,365
get cancelled or just scrapped altogether. Like,
I'll be pissed if this gets cancelled because

282
00:26:33,505 --> 00:26:38,667
the number of unanswered questions in this season
is kind of ridiculous. Like, we don't know

283
00:26:38,947 --> 00:26:44,050
how Amanda Waller learned about the isekai or
who she used to open the portal to it. I mean,

284
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:49,352
my guess was Enchantress, but they never followed
up on that later. We don't know exactly what

285
00:26:49,432 --> 00:26:55,135
resources Amanda Waller is after. or why she
would send the Joker in her first squad if

286
00:26:55,155 --> 00:27:00,759
she knew how chaotic he was. There's just a
ton of stuff that I want answers to that I

287
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:05,062
thought we were gonna get more insights on before
the season wrapped up, but that just wasn't

288
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:10,106
the case. I think they're just trying to draw
it out. Like, come back. If you want the answers,

289
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:15,390
come back. Watch season two. Yeah. Right? I
mean, the Joker did say in episode one, like

290
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:21,722
this was prelude to a very long story. So maybe
it is a really long story. I might be talking

291
00:27:21,742 --> 00:27:25,904
out of my ass here because I haven't watched
a whole lot of anime, but in the anime that

292
00:27:26,004 --> 00:27:33,647
I have seen, usually I found that the end of
it is a little bit anticlimactic actually and

293
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:39,269
it almost appears as if Japanese storytelling
is more about the journey than the destination,

294
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:45,252
I would say. So even if this is the only season
we got, I think it's really less about the

295
00:27:45,472 --> 00:27:50,422
end and more about everything that happened
along the way. You're absolutely right. I was

296
00:27:50,602 --> 00:27:55,345
watching a YouTube video recently that was sort
of explaining how Eastern storytelling differs

297
00:27:55,405 --> 00:27:59,988
from Western in that it doesn't have a three
act structure. It actually has a four act structure.

298
00:28:00,468 --> 00:28:07,972
Their fourth act kind of is an extension of
the denouement after the climax, where it kind

299
00:28:08,012 --> 00:28:13,295
of tells a little bit more about the life of
these characters. And it does feel anticlimactic

300
00:28:13,335 --> 00:28:18,210
because it doesn't end with a climax, which,
you know, Western stories typically do. or

301
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:23,091
shortly after it. So I can see how that would
be the case for a lot of anime. Yes, no, that's

302
00:28:23,151 --> 00:28:28,773
exactly what they do. Whenever they end a series,
it's always, boom, you have this big fight,

303
00:28:28,993 --> 00:28:35,615
and then there's one final episode that will
wrap it up and even jump into the future and

304
00:28:35,655 --> 00:28:40,757
show you, no, hey, this is what they're up to
now that evil has been defeated, right? That

305
00:28:40,777 --> 00:28:46,090
is always how it ends. But they space it out,
right? So throughout their journey, it's multiple

306
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:52,313
kind of climaxes, I guess you can say. Yeah,
for sure. Now, I feel like all of the intriguing

307
00:28:52,373 --> 00:28:56,855
story stuff came sort of in the last seconds
of the show with the reveal that the Joker

308
00:28:57,075 --> 00:29:02,477
had just killed the emperor and taken his place
for a majority of the show. The audience is

309
00:29:02,777 --> 00:29:06,999
pretty much just as lost as the squad itself,
trying to figure out what to do and what's

310
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:12,121
going on. But that kind of makes sense, I guess.
But maybe not for five hours. I felt like.

311
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:18,194
for a majority of the show, the characters are
sort of just quipping, not stop. And I mean,

312
00:29:18,255 --> 00:29:23,379
I think that's kind of just Suicide Squad in
a nutshell. I guess you could say that they

313
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:28,764
did the same thing in the movies. It is a very
comedic concept. So I could see where they

314
00:29:28,784 --> 00:29:34,328
would want to run with that for this anime series.
Did you guys have a favorite like joke throughout

315
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:39,573
the show? I wouldn't have one per se, but I
love the character of Clayface, how he was

316
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:44,938
just like, We're in an isekai and he would just
point out everything. And so to me, that was

317
00:29:44,978 --> 00:29:52,264
kind of like my favorite joke, like him. Yeah.
Clayface. Yeah. I really liked the bar fight

318
00:29:52,304 --> 00:29:56,627
scene that they did, I think, in the eighth
episode or something like that. Really? It

319
00:29:56,667 --> 00:30:02,172
wasn't just one joke per se, but just them starting
a fight while this jester is trying to sing

320
00:30:02,212 --> 00:30:05,895
their praises about being a hero was pretty
hilarious, I thought. Then all of a sudden,

321
00:30:06,035 --> 00:30:10,466
peacemakers gets his pants off. It's like, what?
Yeah, I have no idea what was going on there.

322
00:30:10,606 --> 00:30:16,189
Yeah, I rewound it because I was like, when
did he lose his pants? They were never on.

323
00:30:16,229 --> 00:30:22,071
Of course, they have to show some ass in a DC.
Of course, it's the requisite DC nudity and

324
00:30:22,171 --> 00:30:29,754
animation. Now, to say my favorite part, I think,
was the relationship between Deadshot and Ratcatcher,

325
00:30:30,274 --> 00:30:35,316
how Deadshot thought they were like the best
of friends, homies. And then it turns out that

326
00:30:35,336 --> 00:30:39,600
he just really made Ratcatcher's life a living
hell. I thought that was hilarious. That was

327
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:39,781
good.

335
00:31:34,238 --> 00:31:38,241
Let's talk about the characters more in our
character breakdown, starting with Harley Quinn.

336
00:31:38,801 --> 00:31:44,365
She was the protagonist of the show and really
both the hearts and brains of the team, I would

337
00:31:44,405 --> 00:31:49,267
say. You know, she often gained inspiration
for how to solve certain problems that the

338
00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:54,491
team encountered through her past misadventures
with the Joker. Now, even though she pines

339
00:31:54,531 --> 00:31:59,053
for him throughout the series, you know, unaware
that he's disguised as Katana in the Isekai,

340
00:31:59,562 --> 00:32:05,324
She proves herself to be an accomplished tactician
without him, even concocting the plan that

341
00:32:05,364 --> 00:32:10,726
defeated the Skeleton Queen in the climax of
the show. Like I said, man, favorite version

342
00:32:10,766 --> 00:32:15,869
of Harley Quinn. She's something else. I love
this version. I love her. Did you have a favorite

343
00:32:16,069 --> 00:32:21,291
moment from the series with her? I think when
she kind of put the princess in her place,

344
00:32:21,311 --> 00:32:28,030
I was like, yeah, you tell her, you tell her.
Yeah, I liked her cute. attitude. Like she

345
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:33,552
always called King Shark Nana-chan. Nana-chan,
yeah. I love that too. Yeah, and she had the

346
00:32:33,592 --> 00:32:38,214
pet dragon that she adopted taking it on as
its surrogate mother. She kind of became like

347
00:32:38,234 --> 00:32:41,936
the queen of dragons from Game of Thrones in
that way. That's true. That's an interesting

348
00:32:42,036 --> 00:32:48,539
aspect. That's so Isekai though too, because
the protagonist always gets a little pet. It's

349
00:32:48,579 --> 00:32:53,661
rare that you see like the motherly nurturing
side of Harley Quinn, but it was an interesting

350
00:32:53,701 --> 00:32:57,530
facet to the character displayed in this show.
Yeah, absolutely. Like I mentioned, she was

351
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:02,212
definitely the heart of the team. If I had to
pick my favorite moment from her in the series,

352
00:33:02,692 --> 00:33:07,114
I'd have to say it was probably her sword fight
against Katana. Like after they defeated the

353
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:12,376
Thinker, I loved how Clayface all of a sudden
became a sword. And then she just battled against

354
00:33:12,396 --> 00:33:16,518
Katana. That was so cool. Such a great fight
scene. Probably one of my favorites in the

355
00:33:16,538 --> 00:33:21,480
entire series. Oh, for sure. Especially how
you would see the sword get destroyed. And

356
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,461
because it's Clayface, he would just re like,
he would, you would see them pick up dirt.

357
00:33:25,706 --> 00:33:30,709
to reform the sword. And so I thought it was
so good. That was really cool. Moving on to

358
00:33:30,789 --> 00:33:35,192
Deadshot, you know, the other members of the
squad, they don't really have arcs. They're

359
00:33:35,212 --> 00:33:40,295
pretty static and they're simply there to, I
would say, fill out the five man band trope

360
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:46,019
common to anime. As I mentioned, Harley was
the heart of the team. Deadshot was probably

361
00:33:46,339 --> 00:33:51,046
the leader. He filled that kind of archetype
since he often directed the team on. where

362
00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:55,810
they would go, such as leaving to collect ammo
or instructing the team to put on magic armor.

363
00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:02,776
My favorite moment with him in the series was
how he ended the battle against Rattcatcher

364
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:06,980
and his army with one bullet. I didn't see that
coming. I thought we were gonna have like an

365
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,744
all out army brawl, but for it just to end in
that manner, I thought it was great. That was

366
00:34:12,825 --> 00:34:17,469
a quintessential Deadshot moment. Yeah, no,
I totally agree. For me, it was just, yeah,

367
00:34:17,509 --> 00:34:21,994
just how he got on. throughout the series, I
was like, yeah, you're cool. I'd hang out with

368
00:34:22,014 --> 00:34:26,876
you, Deadshot. He was the coolest one. Yeah.
Alongside Peacemaker, I would say, Peacemaker,

369
00:34:27,116 --> 00:34:32,378
he's the team lancer or like the skilled rebel
of the group. Someone who often clashes with

370
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:37,479
the leader. And you definitely saw that in this
series with him clashing with Deadshot. Now,

371
00:34:37,499 --> 00:34:43,401
I didn't love Peacemaker in this series. I thought
he was kind of weird, like too stoic and very

372
00:34:43,441 --> 00:34:48,327
different from John Cena's take, but I guess.
They needed him to be a foil to the short fused

373
00:34:48,427 --> 00:34:53,371
dead shot. I loved Peacemaker in this season.
Yeah, he was my favorite character, actually.

374
00:34:53,771 --> 00:34:57,073
I remember I was watching the show with my wife
and she was like, I thought the Peacemaker

375
00:34:57,113 --> 00:35:01,777
is supposed to be like funny. I'm like, maybe
John Cena, you know, as written by James Gunn.

376
00:35:01,837 --> 00:35:05,479
But from what I know of him in the comics, you
know, he's not that funny. He's actually a

377
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:11,564
lot more stoic and serious of a character. So
I like how they went that route with him and

378
00:35:11,604 --> 00:35:17,179
just how like dedicated to his cause he was.
He was funny in that sense. Yeah, I think that

379
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:22,523
worked for him. I have to say I prefer this
one over the John Cena one. Really? I would

380
00:35:22,543 --> 00:35:29,027
agree. Yeah. Really? Yeah, I'm sorry, John Cena.
That's fair. Moving on to King Shark. He was

381
00:35:29,067 --> 00:35:33,590
the big guy or the muscle of the group. If I
had to pick a favorite moment with him, it

382
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:38,513
was probably his battles with Killer Croc, only
because I was surprised to see Killer Croc.

383
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:43,207
I always figured that King Shark would have
been like more than a match against Killer

384
00:35:43,247 --> 00:35:47,188
Kroc, especially with the healing factor that
they gave King Shark in the show. But the show

385
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:51,809
definitely upped Killer Kroc's fighting skill,
I would say. He was like a boxer, so it kind

386
00:35:51,829 --> 00:35:56,470
of worked. Let's talk about that healing factor
though, because some of the characters seems

387
00:35:56,530 --> 00:36:01,132
to get power upgrades while some of the characters
did not. Now, King Shark, he got a healing

388
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:07,373
factor. Clayface, he got geokinesis. And I guess
Harley Quinn, I don't know. Sometimes she was

389
00:36:07,413 --> 00:36:11,460
able to. someone's super strength or something
like that. But what did the other guys get?

390
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:17,424
It was not quite clear what happened to the
other characters and like why their abilities

391
00:36:17,444 --> 00:36:21,907
were enhanced. Yeah, I don't think they unlocked
any special abilities. I don't think so. It's

392
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:26,190
just those three. Like even the guys on the
other side, the other suicide squad members,

393
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:30,573
they didn't really have powers either. Well,
Ratcatcher was upgraded. Yeah, he was able

394
00:36:30,593 --> 00:36:36,157
to control wolves. But that was because of the
crystal, right? Like it wasn't his power. I

395
00:36:36,177 --> 00:36:40,780
wasn't sure about that. I thought that was unclear.
In the comics, you know, he has a device that

396
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:46,144
controls rats as well. So I wasn't sure if he
just got an upgraded device in this world or

397
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:50,467
what happened. But I also thought Killer Croc
got an upgrade because he was able to control

398
00:36:50,487 --> 00:36:56,091
that underwater leviathan. Yeah. Who was that
guy? Where did he come from? The Isekai. That

399
00:36:56,111 --> 00:37:00,675
thing pissed me off when he first showed up,
because I was like, oh, sweet. We get Croc

400
00:37:00,695 --> 00:37:05,874
versus shark. And then all of a sudden, two
seconds later, stupid. octopus fish thing,

401
00:37:06,174 --> 00:37:14,458
grab shark and there's no fight. I was like,
man, fuck that fish. It didn't make sense.

402
00:37:14,778 --> 00:37:19,720
Maybe it was kind of like a dragon type situation
where one of the bad Suicide Squad members

403
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,882
had adopted a small fish as a pet or something
like that and then it grew. I don't know. That

404
00:37:23,902 --> 00:37:31,325
makes sense. But I guess if the good guys got
the dragon, then yeah. They did call it a Leviathan,

405
00:37:31,525 --> 00:37:37,873
right? So. I believe so, yeah. And Kroc called
it his little bro. Yeah. So you could be onto

406
00:37:37,913 --> 00:37:42,035
something there. But I think the other characters
would develop powers and everything. I think

407
00:37:42,075 --> 00:37:46,078
if they do bring it back, then I think some
of those characters will start developing powers,

408
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:49,881
which I think would be pretty cool. Although
now that they have the armor that they got

409
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:55,245
at the end, the magic armor, maybe some of them
don't even need those just innate upgrades,

410
00:37:55,385 --> 00:37:59,948
magic upgrades, and they could just use the
armor. Man, I know we'll get there, but that

411
00:38:00,068 --> 00:38:05,596
armor was incredible. I loved it. how it turned
the entire show into like a Dynasty Warriors

412
00:38:05,656 --> 00:38:10,860
video game. I was pumped. I watched that scene
twice. That whole thing. It was great. It was

413
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:16,966
good. That is your typical like going super
say in moment. Yeah. Oh, for sure. We would

414
00:38:16,986 --> 00:38:22,090
call it. Yeah. No, it was so good. They even
had like the transformation scenes. I thought

415
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:26,554
those were good. Those are funny. Power Rangers,
sailor moon type transformations. Love it.

416
00:38:27,034 --> 00:38:33,782
Love it. Moving on to Clayface. He was. the
absolute standout character of the show for

417
00:38:33,822 --> 00:38:39,324
me, probably because I've never seen the character
done this way before. His alter ego, Basil

418
00:38:39,344 --> 00:38:44,785
Carlo, was an actor, and he's a diva on the
Harley Quinn show, but he's never been like

419
00:38:45,145 --> 00:38:52,187
cool before, like he was in this show, or maybe
like ironically so. He also provided exposition

420
00:38:52,227 --> 00:38:55,888
for the team, as well as the audience who may
not have been familiar with the tropes from

421
00:38:55,988 --> 00:39:01,703
anime and Hollywood cinema. And that strangely
made him the team's quote unquote smart guy

422
00:39:01,983 --> 00:39:06,627
while also being the comedic relief. Every time
you spoke, I was like, this guy's a dumb ass.

423
00:39:06,847 --> 00:39:13,513
I love it. Right. So yeah, no, Clayface is cool.
I really liked Clayface in this. He was definitely

424
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:19,418
that kind of vain pretty boy type character,
but it did make me wonder why the Clayface

425
00:39:19,438 --> 00:39:25,363
from the comics is such a tragic figure. If
he can shape shift into a beautiful form, whatever

426
00:39:25,424 --> 00:39:30,864
he wants to, he just like chooses not to. I
don't understand why he doesn't do that because

427
00:39:31,004 --> 00:39:36,388
this version of Clayface had no problem altering
his appearance in that way and he wasn't nearly

428
00:39:36,428 --> 00:39:41,753
the tragic character that he is in the comics.
You know, he had trouble maintaining his prior

429
00:39:41,773 --> 00:39:46,857
form. This show kind of did away with that.
They made it so that he was a pretty seamless

430
00:39:47,077 --> 00:39:50,820
shapeshifter, but he's not always like that
in the comics. He can't maintain it for very

431
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:56,905
long. Okay, that makes sense. Now, I totally
thought Clayface was El Diablo from the trailers.

432
00:39:57,522 --> 00:40:02,545
I was way wrong. It turned out Clayface just
had expanded control over Clay in the isekai

433
00:40:02,906 --> 00:40:08,390
and that was visualized in this like glowy fiery
kind of way. But I was happily surprised to

434
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:13,313
find out it was Clayface. I was like, what?
OK. I didn't fully know it was him until the

435
00:40:13,353 --> 00:40:18,617
end of the first episode when they did those
character roll call title cards, kind of. Oh,

436
00:40:18,797 --> 00:40:23,381
yeah. Where each character got to showcase their
ability in the fight when they first got into

437
00:40:23,401 --> 00:40:28,111
the isekai. That was pretty dope. My favorite
moment from Clayface was probably when he brought

438
00:40:28,131 --> 00:40:33,354
down the fortress. Like not only was it a great
feat for the character, but I also thought

439
00:40:33,374 --> 00:40:37,377
it was just hilarious that the fortress ended
up belonging to the kingdom. Oh, you're talking

440
00:40:37,397 --> 00:40:42,440
about in the fight against Ratcatcher? Yeah.
Yeah, that was a great showcase of his kind

441
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,303
of intellect, how he was kind of the smart guy
of the group because in this weird meta way,

442
00:40:47,383 --> 00:40:52,718
he had an understanding of the situation that
they were in being an Isekai fan himself. But

443
00:40:52,778 --> 00:40:57,661
yeah, it was his idea to bring down the water
towers and to make the stone that they were

444
00:40:57,701 --> 00:41:03,084
standing on a little bit more malleable. Yeah,
no, he was definitely a lot more intelligent

445
00:41:03,304 --> 00:41:07,967
than he's ever really been portrayed. But it
totally made sense the way they did it though,

446
00:41:08,047 --> 00:41:12,189
too, because, you know, being a fan of movies
and just like culture and stuff like that,

447
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:18,813
he was the geek of the group. Moving on to Princess
Fiona or Fiona? Fiona. She was the literal...

448
00:41:19,074 --> 00:41:25,279
damsel in distress, this demure royal with a
traumatic childhood in which her friend as

449
00:41:25,299 --> 00:41:30,403
a kid was killed after she told him how much
food soldiers in the war had. She made it her

450
00:41:30,443 --> 00:41:35,407
life's purpose to end the war, partly out of
guilt, but she was too timid to confront her

451
00:41:35,447 --> 00:41:40,811
mother, Queen Aldora, even when the Queen's
behavior became more and more erratic and harsh.

452
00:41:41,352 --> 00:41:46,756
Eventually, she was inspired by Harley Quinn,
her doppelganger, and to becoming more independent

453
00:41:46,936 --> 00:41:51,358
and confrontational. for the sake of her kingdom.
Yeah, I guess I don't have too much to say

454
00:41:51,398 --> 00:41:55,620
about her. I think her twist at the end was
something that we all kind of saw coming. And

455
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:00,581
they set it up pretty well, I thought. I wouldn't
say I seen it coming. Like I had an inkling

456
00:42:00,641 --> 00:42:04,042
of it. I was like, why does she look so much
like Harley Quinn? I was like, there must be

457
00:42:04,102 --> 00:42:07,743
something going on there. And I thought like,
oh, maybe we're gonna find, you know, this

458
00:42:07,823 --> 00:42:12,744
medieval version of Deadshot and the rest of
the characters. So that kind of threw me a

459
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:16,925
little bit for a loop. But like, I have to say
my favorite moment with the princess was when

460
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:22,411
She turns around and she's wearing the makeup.
Yes. And she's like, I am sick and tired of

461
00:42:22,451 --> 00:42:28,093
this fucking shit. And just the guy with the
baseball bat. I was like, yes. I was like,

462
00:42:28,113 --> 00:42:33,534
do your thing, girl. That was great. The last
character I do want to talk about is the Joker.

463
00:42:33,834 --> 00:42:38,996
He's a pretty mysterious character throughout
the show, which kind of works for the character

464
00:42:39,076 --> 00:42:44,077
in that he should always be unpredictable. And
while I do feel like he was shoehorned into

465
00:42:44,097 --> 00:42:48,808
the show's final minutes. and that the reveal
wasn't as shocking or as satisfying as it should

466
00:42:48,848 --> 00:42:54,153
have been, the more I've dwelt on it, the more
I'm glad that he's being positioned as the

467
00:42:54,193 --> 00:42:59,677
series' main antagonist. I like the concept
of the Suicide Squad versus the Joker, especially

468
00:42:59,697 --> 00:43:04,762
when Harley Quinn is positioned as one of the
team leads. Yeah, I definitely think that sets

469
00:43:04,822 --> 00:43:10,306
up something pretty cool down the line, because
you know, once Harley Quinn finds out, she's

470
00:43:10,346 --> 00:43:14,714
going to obviously switch sides, and that's
going to cause a whole bunch of drama. but

471
00:43:14,774 --> 00:43:20,338
then something's gonna lead to her rejoining
the Suicide Squad, so I'm very interested in

472
00:43:20,378 --> 00:43:24,542
how that whole thing would play out. Oh yeah,
it's gonna bring great conflict to season two

473
00:43:24,582 --> 00:43:29,846
if there is a season two. I really liked this
version of the Joker. I liked how philosophical

474
00:43:29,886 --> 00:43:36,371
he was. He was like this wise, chaotic, anarchist.
And really his whole motivation for doing everything

475
00:43:36,391 --> 00:43:42,957
that he did was to provide a more interesting
life, I guess, for Harley Quinn and everybody

476
00:43:43,017 --> 00:43:48,876
else in the squad. Yeah, which is fascinating.
Like he's such a wild card in that sense. And

477
00:43:48,916 --> 00:43:55,199
yeah, because it's hard to empathize with that
type of thinking, it does make him very mysterious.

478
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:59,961
And I thought it was actually a really damn
good twist. My jaw dropped in the final minutes

479
00:44:00,001 --> 00:44:05,363
of the last episode. Yeah, I did not see that
coming at all. Like I was like, oh shit, okay.

480
00:44:05,664 --> 00:44:11,006
The Joker can scrap too. I was like, I love
it. Right, yeah. Yeah, I mean, at the beginning

481
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:15,847
of the series, Joker theorizes that everyone
longs to be part of a new world where things

482
00:44:15,867 --> 00:44:20,869
are more fantastical and free. You know, part
of his motivation for causing havoc is to make

483
00:44:20,889 --> 00:44:26,430
the world a more fantastical place. And when
he enters a literal fantasy world, he takes

484
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:31,332
on the role of the mysterious wild card, like
you mentioned, Joseph, you know, seemingly

485
00:44:31,592 --> 00:44:36,293
neither friend nor foe. Up until the final moments
when he decides to take charge of things and

486
00:44:36,313 --> 00:44:41,668
kill the emperor. because the Skeleton Queen's
plan to unleash death on the entire world would

487
00:44:41,688 --> 00:44:46,851
have led to peace and quiet, and the Joker doesn't
want that. He wants to see everyone live on

488
00:44:46,871 --> 00:44:52,294
the edge, as he says in his own words. It's
a fantastic setup for season two. It was a

489
00:44:52,334 --> 00:44:58,777
fantastic take on the Joker, I agree. So much
so that I can't think of a recent version of

490
00:44:58,797 --> 00:45:04,240
the Joker that I think is as well done as this.
As little as screen time as he had, I still

491
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:10,320
think that he was done remarkably well. I like
how this version of the Joker took heavily

492
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,622
from the characterization of Heath Ledger's
Joker even though they kind of made him look

493
00:45:13,642 --> 00:45:18,565
a little bit more like Jared Leto's. Jared Leto
could only wish that they would have had like

494
00:45:18,605 --> 00:45:23,408
the design insight they had for this Joker with
like the tattoo of the smile. That was sick.

495
00:45:23,428 --> 00:45:27,911
I like that. That was awesome. Yeah, no, I was
just going to ask you guys what did you think

496
00:45:27,971 --> 00:45:33,714
of the Joker's design? And yeah, probably one
of my favorites. I wonder why they didn't go

497
00:45:33,754 --> 00:45:38,918
this route in the 2016 Suicide Squad movie with
Jared Leto. They had did the thing where he

498
00:45:38,978 --> 00:45:43,462
tattooed a smile on his hand, but he had tattoos
on his face already, so you would think that

499
00:45:43,482 --> 00:45:48,326
he would just put a smile on his face like they
did in this anime. You'd think. I feel like

500
00:45:48,386 --> 00:45:53,049
if they did that, it would have been some big
goofy red smile and it would have looked even

501
00:45:53,129 --> 00:45:58,153
worse. But what if it had sharp teeth and everything?
I don't know. I would have to see it in action,

502
00:45:58,353 --> 00:46:03,047
I think. before I totally sign off on it. But
conceptually, I feel like it's there. I feel

503
00:46:03,067 --> 00:46:03,629
like it makes sense.

504
00:46:10,958 --> 00:46:16,539
Moving on to the story highlights, in episode
one, as the Joker and Harley Quinn wreak havoc

505
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:22,281
in Gotham City, they are attacked by Argus agents.
The Joker escapes, but Harley is defeated and

506
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:28,182
captured by Katana. Meanwhile, Argus's director
Amanda Waller oversees the opening of a portal

507
00:46:28,222 --> 00:46:34,484
to another world. Six months later, she tasks
Belriiv and mates Harley, Deadshot Clayface

508
00:46:34,524 --> 00:46:40,070
Peacemaker, and King Shark with entering the
Isekai to collect resources. and implants time

509
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:44,813
bombs on their necks that will explode in 72
hours unless they receive a radio signal from

510
00:46:44,853 --> 00:46:51,097
her regularly to discourage any escape attempts.
Additionally, she blackmails Deadshot by threatening

511
00:46:51,137 --> 00:46:57,101
his daughter. As the squad enters the portal,
their helicopter crashes in a world that Clayfist

512
00:46:57,121 --> 00:47:02,224
calls an isekai before they are ambushed by
orcs and an army of knights, neither of whom

513
00:47:02,465 --> 00:47:07,635
they are able to understand. despite repelling
the orcs that are captured by the knights and

514
00:47:07,675 --> 00:47:13,676
taken to a prison fortress. Elsewhere, Kitana
and several supervillains speak to a mysterious

515
00:47:13,736 --> 00:47:19,578
figure. Now the beginning of the series, after
the Joker blows up those businessmen, him and

516
00:47:19,618 --> 00:47:25,320
Harley escape in this car that's controlled
by a piano. Which I thought was awesome. Yeah,

517
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:29,081
that's something you definitely don't see every
day, but I mean it kind of makes sense for

518
00:47:29,101 --> 00:47:33,979
the characters. I dug it. Who do you guys think
was the girl that Waller used to open the portal?

519
00:47:33,999 --> 00:47:38,441
Do you think it was Enchantress? It seems like
it was Enchantress because the way the portal

520
00:47:38,481 --> 00:47:43,603
manifested with that kind of emerald looking
visual was the same kind of visual that they

521
00:47:43,743 --> 00:47:48,465
used to portray her magic powers later on in
the series. No, I agree with that totally,

522
00:47:48,505 --> 00:47:55,368
because, yeah, portal was green. So who else?
That's what I think. I do wonder who took out

523
00:47:55,408 --> 00:48:00,806
the helicopter pilots. That was never addressed.
Because like the agent, I think his name was

524
00:48:00,946 --> 00:48:05,948
Adam, goes to the front and the helicopter pilots
look like they've been sniped. I don't know

525
00:48:05,968 --> 00:48:10,729
if that was the Joker or what happened there,
but it was never addressed. Yeah, you're right.

526
00:48:10,749 --> 00:48:16,050
Good question, yeah, pothole. Cause yeah, like
I don't, like nobody else in that world would

527
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:21,132
really know how to use a gun or have that kind
of precision, right? It would have had to have

528
00:48:21,152 --> 00:48:24,793
been the Joker, you would think. I hope it was.
Yeah, especially if you could throw hands like

529
00:48:24,813 --> 00:48:29,406
that, he probably could shoot very well as well.
Just a... Jack of all trades. I think he's

530
00:48:29,427 --> 00:48:34,569
like a super joker almost. Like he's not like
actually super, but like he's very talented,

531
00:48:34,729 --> 00:48:39,272
you know what I mean? Yeah. Any guy who could
like play a piano like that, for sure talented.

532
00:48:40,332 --> 00:48:45,735
Moving on to episode two, a royal court discusses
the current war and their prisoners. Queen

533
00:48:45,755 --> 00:48:50,918
Eldora dismisses both the starving peasants
and the squad's presence, but Princess Fiona

534
00:48:51,198 --> 00:48:56,841
believes the latter may be of use and orders
her elite knight, Cecile, to bring them to

535
00:48:56,881 --> 00:49:02,057
her. Meanwhile, following the squad's imprisonment,
Clayface tries to escape, but the guards put

536
00:49:02,117 --> 00:49:07,361
magical handcuffs on him that negate his powers.
They later meet an elite Argus soldier named

537
00:49:07,421 --> 00:49:12,184
Rick Flag, who reveals he knows them, that they
are meant to serve as Waller's suicide squad,

538
00:49:12,624 --> 00:49:16,867
and their predecessors went missing six months
ago. He knows of an area where they can receive

539
00:49:16,907 --> 00:49:21,591
Waller's signal, and under the threat of their
bombs, Clayface releases the other inmates

540
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:27,175
while the squad start a riot and successfully
take over the prison. However, they are reconfronted

541
00:49:27,195 --> 00:49:33,901
by the Knights who arrested them. My favorite
scene in this episode is probably in the prison

542
00:49:33,941 --> 00:49:38,565
cafeteria where they're having trouble communicating
with the Orc and it just leads to this all

543
00:49:38,605 --> 00:49:45,792
out brawl. I love just how savvy the Suicide
Squad was when it came to like prison politics.

544
00:49:46,312 --> 00:49:50,556
Clayface thought he knew what was going on,
but he was really just a distraction for the

545
00:49:50,616 --> 00:49:56,299
others to up the ante. Yeah, that was a lot
of fun. I liked the orc prisoners and how through

546
00:49:56,339 --> 00:50:01,001
brawling with them and alongside them, they
kind of became their allies. Moving on to episode

547
00:50:01,021 --> 00:50:06,023
three, before the squad can fight, the Knights
flag stops them and attempts to reason with

548
00:50:06,063 --> 00:50:11,705
Cecile using words he learned from orc prisoners.
Despite being insulted by this, Cecile follows

549
00:50:11,745 --> 00:50:17,468
through on Fiona's orders. They soon meet Eldora
and Fiona, the latter of whom resembles Harley.

550
00:50:18,008 --> 00:50:23,758
After Eldora casts a translation spell to facilitate
contact. Flag confesses that his previous squad

551
00:50:23,798 --> 00:50:29,941
escaped and became generals in the enemy forces.
She demands the squad be executed until a peacemaker

552
00:50:29,981 --> 00:50:35,063
convinces her to let them take on a mission
from her instead. She accepts under the condition

553
00:50:35,083 --> 00:50:40,606
that Flag remains imprisoned until the mission
succeeds. After the squad regain their equipment,

554
00:50:40,886 --> 00:50:45,788
they take advantage of Cecile's fight with an
army of werewolves to sneak into the werewolves

555
00:50:45,828 --> 00:50:51,000
fortress where they encounter Ratcatcher, who
holds a grudge against Deadshot for slandering

556
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:56,885
and humiliating Kim while they were incarcerated
together. Using a magic scepter, he takes control

557
00:50:56,905 --> 00:51:01,949
of a pack of werewolves to seek revenge. Though
the squad defeats the werewolves, Katana rescues

558
00:51:02,029 --> 00:51:08,495
Ratcatcher, who intends to control a different
army to kill the squad. I loved how Rick Flag

559
00:51:08,515 --> 00:51:14,240
was talking to Cecile at the beginning of this
episode. I was cracking up. What did he call

560
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:19,483
him again? He kept calling him like a... stank
ass or something like that. Yeah. Something.

561
00:51:19,864 --> 00:51:24,506
It was hilarious. Moving on to episode 4, in
a flashback, a young Fiona snuck out of the

562
00:51:24,546 --> 00:51:29,709
castle to befriend peasants, only for them to
be killed in the war. In the present, Eldora

563
00:51:29,749 --> 00:51:34,612
refuses to release the squad despite their victory
because they destroyed the kingdom's fortress.

564
00:51:35,093 --> 00:51:40,276
Harley berates Fiona for reminding the former
of her old self, as Cecil explains how the

565
00:51:40,296 --> 00:51:45,075
war that Eldora's kingdom is involved in has
lasted decades. especially after the elves

566
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:49,699
and beastmen betrayed them. Ratcatcher takes
command of a beast army and approaches the

567
00:51:49,719 --> 00:51:55,544
castle and Harley recruits Eldora's prisoners
to aid the squad, but Deadshot destroys Ratcatcher's

568
00:51:55,564 --> 00:52:02,150
scepter, causing his army to betray him and
then surrender. As a reward, Cecile frees the

569
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:07,514
squad, who leave to receive Waller's signal,
with 12 hours left on their bombs. The kingdom

570
00:52:07,574 --> 00:52:12,730
celebrates, though Eldora is displeased. This
episode was pretty dope. And that's what I

571
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:17,852
was saying, too. Like the whole thing of like
the scepter is his main source of power. Yeah.

572
00:52:18,032 --> 00:52:22,894
Like I don't think they explained where he got
the scepter from. I thought it was just made

573
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:27,756
with like magical artifacts that he probably
got through the empire. Kind of the same way

574
00:52:27,836 --> 00:52:32,318
that Harley Quinn stuck that magic gem on top
of her gun. And then all of a sudden, they

575
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:36,860
shot like magic bullets. Yeah. I think is what
I'm guessing. OK. I mean, fair enough. Fair

576
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:41,246
enough. I wasn't the biggest fan of Rack Hatcher.
I don't know why, I didn't like his design

577
00:52:41,286 --> 00:52:47,269
in this one. I think they included him probably
because Ritecatcher was in the Suicide Squad.

578
00:52:47,729 --> 00:52:53,611
I didn't mind it, I thought it was cool again
to see like new faces, new comic villains and

579
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:59,474
see how they were interpreted. The purple mohawk
was pretty wild I thought. In episode five,

580
00:52:59,554 --> 00:53:04,236
the squad reaches the portal which is in the
sky in time to reset their bombs, giving them

581
00:53:04,316 --> 00:53:10,431
72 more hours. They continue helping Eldora's
kingdom. but Deadshot runs out of bullets.

582
00:53:10,811 --> 00:53:16,016
Flag says his helicopter, which was left on
a mountain, has more weapons. In routes, they

583
00:53:16,056 --> 00:53:20,659
stop and party with the former prisoners who
were left in charge of the fortress, and Harley

584
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:26,724
acquires a magical size-shifting frying pan.
Upon reaching the helicopter, they find a dragon

585
00:53:27,085 --> 00:53:31,728
made a nest with it before it attacks them.
While Harley uses the frying pan to deflect

586
00:53:31,788 --> 00:53:36,452
its fire breath, Peacemaker distracts it by
stealing its egg, and Deadshot knocks it off

587
00:53:36,472 --> 00:53:41,870
the mountain with a rocket launcher. The egg
hatches and the baby dragon imprints on Harley,

588
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:47,572
who names it Arthur. Flag secretly contacts
Waller and informs her of the situation. She

589
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:52,553
tells him to kill the traitors in the previous
squad. After acquiring the weapons, the squad

590
00:53:52,573 --> 00:53:57,275
returns with Arthur, but finds the fortress
on fire and the Enchantress and the Thinker

591
00:53:57,335 --> 00:54:02,376
looming in the sky. If any episode I thought
kind of dragged on was kind of boring, I thought

592
00:54:02,396 --> 00:54:06,557
it was this one. It was like a transitionary
episode, like the first half of the episode.

593
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:11,213
Their whole motivation is just to get more ammo
to resupply, right? There's not a whole lot

594
00:54:11,273 --> 00:54:15,156
of plot going on here, except for the dragon
fight, which is pretty good. And then the whole

595
00:54:15,196 --> 00:54:20,260
imprinting thing. Episode six, after finding
their friends from the prison have been executed

596
00:54:20,300 --> 00:54:25,303
by brainwashed elves. The squad fights them,
Enchantress and the Thinker. King Shark is

597
00:54:25,343 --> 00:54:30,387
knocked into a lake where he is beaten and captured
by Killer Croc and a sea monster. Thinker makes

598
00:54:30,447 --> 00:54:35,235
Deadshot Clayface and Peacemaker experience
nightmares. then shoots them with a gun after

599
00:54:35,275 --> 00:54:40,699
Enchantress disapproves of making them suffer.
Enchantress asks Harley to join them, but Harley

600
00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:46,182
refuses. Flag claims he can make the rogue's
bombs explode, but the trio calls his bluff

601
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:51,566
and leave. After Harley reunites with Deadshot,
Clayface, and Peacemaker, the squad is re-imprisoned,

602
00:54:51,966 --> 00:54:58,411
and Eldora declares they will be executed to
deter incompetence. Finding this unfair, Fionne

603
00:54:58,591 --> 00:55:04,791
and Cecile release them and provide a carriage.
As the squad decides to take the fight to the

604
00:55:04,831 --> 00:55:11,355
villains, Tinker finds the portal and erects
a tower around it. I was confused at the end

605
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:15,417
of this episode when Rick Flagg was bluffing
that he could blow up their heads because he

606
00:55:15,457 --> 00:55:18,699
had that controller device with their faces
on it and everything like that. In the next

607
00:55:18,739 --> 00:55:22,621
episode, I was like, why doesn't he just use
that? Because it wasn't entirely clear to me

608
00:55:22,661 --> 00:55:26,503
that he actually was bluffing. I thought he
actually had their controls on him, because

609
00:55:26,523 --> 00:55:31,126
it would make sense that he would, considering
he was their handler. So. I'm not sure why

610
00:55:31,166 --> 00:55:35,067
he didn't have the ability to blow up their
heads. Well, I don't think it was clear that

611
00:55:35,107 --> 00:55:42,169
he was bluffing until he let them go, because
I think he would have blown them up if he was

612
00:55:42,209 --> 00:55:47,410
able to, because he was under orders from Amanda
Waller to do so, to kill the old squad. And

613
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:53,972
he didn't do that. Well, did he not have the
controller when they got split up originally?

614
00:55:54,012 --> 00:55:57,453
So don't you think he would have just killed
them? Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. Yeah.

615
00:55:57,982 --> 00:56:02,204
Yeah, I don't think Amanda Waller gave him the
control to do that. I think she was the only

616
00:56:02,264 --> 00:56:07,347
one who had the controls to blow up the suicide
squad bombs. That's stupid. Yeah, that's weird

617
00:56:07,387 --> 00:56:12,670
because like even in the live action movies,
Flagg had the ability to blow people's heads

618
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:17,833
up. Yeah, I don't know. It was kind of weird
in the way that they kind of teased that he

619
00:56:17,853 --> 00:56:22,716
might have that ability. But then I was like,
oh, psych, who knows? It's a plot hole. I think

620
00:56:22,756 --> 00:56:28,299
it just went on to show that. He never had the
ability to blow up their bombs to begin with.

621
00:56:28,739 --> 00:56:33,521
But it does beg the question, why didn't Amanda
Waller just blow them up from the other side

622
00:56:33,561 --> 00:56:37,363
of the portal? Even when they were close to
it, yeah. I did like this episode a lot. In

623
00:56:37,383 --> 00:56:42,325
fact, I really liked the second half of the
season a lot more than the first. I feel like

624
00:56:42,745 --> 00:56:47,768
once they started getting involved with more
of the other squad members like Enchantress,

625
00:56:48,048 --> 00:56:53,519
the Thinker, then it really started to become
more interesting. Moving on to episode seven,

626
00:56:53,779 --> 00:56:57,963
with a few hours left on their bombs, the squad
discovers Thinker built a tower and fortress

627
00:56:58,003 --> 00:57:03,247
around the portal and is guarded by Katana and
brainwashed elves. Clayface infiltrates the

628
00:57:03,267 --> 00:57:08,852
fortress and imitates Thinker to distract Katana
while the others distract the elves. Amidst

629
00:57:08,912 --> 00:57:14,097
this, Peacemaker captures one and tortures him
to death, hurting the other elves due to the

630
00:57:14,137 --> 00:57:19,914
Thinker's linking of their minds. As Harley
engages the Thinker, he enters her mind. and

631
00:57:19,954 --> 00:57:26,098
sees a memory of the Joker seducing her. However,
she commands the memory Joker to help her defeat

632
00:57:26,138 --> 00:57:31,983
Thinker, freeing the elves. As the fortress
and tower collapse, Kitana, who had defeated

633
00:57:32,023 --> 00:57:38,708
Clayface, kills Thinker and takes his thinking
cap. Harley and Clayface join forces to defeat

634
00:57:38,728 --> 00:57:45,213
Kitana, breaking her naginata and knocking her
mask off, though she escapes. With their bombs

635
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:51,311
reset once more, The squad celebrate by having
Arthur burn down the enemy flag. When the kingdom

636
00:57:51,371 --> 00:57:56,232
receives word of the squad's victory, a furious
Eldora orders them to be brought in dead or

637
00:57:56,292 --> 00:58:02,874
alive. Horrifying and confusing, Fiona and Cecile.
Absolute badassery when she's just standing

638
00:58:02,914 --> 00:58:08,176
there, just like holding the head. Yeah. Oh,
damn. Oh, that was so cool. I was like, what

639
00:58:08,196 --> 00:58:12,157
the hell's going on here? Because that's not
Katana, but I didn't know who it was. I thought

640
00:58:12,177 --> 00:58:16,142
she was like possessed or something like that.
But yeah, this was my second favorite episode.

641
00:58:16,382 --> 00:58:20,644
My favorite being the last episode, but this
was a pretty good one. I guess my one question

642
00:58:20,764 --> 00:58:26,447
is if all the elves minds were linked, then
that means if any of them like got, say, punched

643
00:58:26,487 --> 00:58:29,668
in the face in the course of battle, wouldn't
they all feel like they just got punched in

644
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:33,770
the face? That's exactly what happened. Yeah.
Yeah, but like they went against the elves

645
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:37,571
in the previous episode and that did not happen.
That's a good question. I don't know. That's

646
00:58:37,611 --> 00:58:43,806
probably a plot hole. You're just overthinking
it. Yeah. Stop. What are you doing? Anime logic,

647
00:58:44,046 --> 00:58:49,147
that's what it is. I think maybe the thinker
didn't link up all their minds until they were

648
00:58:49,167 --> 00:58:54,889
all trying to find the squad. I don't know.
Sure. OK. It's as good a rationale as any,

649
00:58:54,949 --> 00:59:00,130
I suppose. I have to say, I did get a little
bit upset that Harley Quinn was holding her

650
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:04,351
own against Katana, because in my mind, Katana
is a much better fighter than Harley Quinn.

651
00:59:04,711 --> 00:59:09,933
Harley Quinn being more of a brawler, I guess,
in my mind. But knowing that was in fact the

652
00:59:09,993 --> 00:59:14,982
Joker in the sword fight against Harley Quinn,
The fact that it was a more even match sat

653
00:59:15,022 --> 00:59:20,964
a little bit better with me after that reveal.
I agree, because in the opening episode, Katana

654
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:25,445
essentially wiped the floor with Harley Quinn.
She was playing with her like a cat plays with

655
00:59:25,465 --> 00:59:30,846
a mouse. So when all of a sudden Harley was
able to hold her own, I agree. I was like,

656
00:59:30,866 --> 00:59:37,548
what is this? But in hindsight, it worked. Well,
the thing too in anime is a lot of the power

657
00:59:37,588 --> 00:59:43,094
of friendship. And that's what I felt like she
was using when fighting Katana in that. moment.

658
00:59:43,254 --> 00:59:48,476
Oh, with Clayface? Yeah, so she kind of got
like that ability buff and she was able to

659
00:59:48,496 --> 00:59:53,538
like throw hands. In episode 8, the squad is
invited back to the castle, but Aldora and

660
00:59:53,558 --> 00:59:58,721
her court refused to thank them for their victories.
One noble, ordered by Aldora before the squad's

661
00:59:58,741 --> 01:00:03,903
arrival, talks against them and slaps Harley,
resulting in an enraged King Shark killing

662
01:00:03,943 --> 01:00:09,765
him. Aldora arrests King Shark and says he will
be executed, then exiles the rest of the squad.

663
01:00:10,158 --> 01:00:14,739
P&A tries to apologize but Harley tells her
off for not standing up for them and leaves

664
01:00:14,759 --> 01:00:19,960
her baseball bat behind. The depressed squad
gets drunk at a bar but tempers flair and they

665
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,342
start a bar brawl. The next day, Flag contacts
Waller about resetting the bombs but when he

666
01:00:25,382 --> 01:00:31,343
tells her what happened, she declares them failures
and detonates Clayface's bomb. An enraged Flag

667
01:00:31,403 --> 01:00:36,205
tells her off but they spot that the castle
is on fire. Waller says they have 24 hours

668
01:00:36,225 --> 01:00:41,535
to salvage the situation or she will detonate
the others. After the call ends, Clayface regenerates.

669
01:00:41,996 --> 01:00:47,721
Flag leaves the squad in rescuing King Shark
and the castle. Two hours prior, Fiona visits

670
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:52,465
Eldora's room to plead for King Shark life,
but was horrified to see Eldora's reflection

671
01:00:52,525 --> 01:00:58,411
in her mirror is that of a skeletal monster.
Great episode, I thought. When that nobleman

672
01:00:58,511 --> 01:01:04,356
slapped Harley, I was like, oh shit, it's about
to go down. And I was so happy to see King

673
01:01:04,376 --> 01:01:08,928
Shark just eat the guy right away. Yeah, I was
wondering which of the Suicide Squad members

674
01:01:08,968 --> 01:01:13,832
or maybe even Harley herself was going to kick
some ass at that point. But it makes sense

675
01:01:13,852 --> 01:01:17,935
that it was King Shark. Yeah, I guess I didn't
say this earlier, but my favorite thing about

676
01:01:17,975 --> 01:01:22,559
King Shark, just in general, is how he's just
constantly eating people. You know, he's just

677
01:01:22,579 --> 01:01:25,742
standing in the background and all of a sudden
he's just got a foot hanging out of his mouth

678
01:01:25,822 --> 01:01:31,366
after he fought those elves. Right. I'm like,
huh, when did he eat that person? So yeah,

679
01:01:31,406 --> 01:01:36,738
that was probably my favorite thing about Shark.
And I was just like... Get his ass, shark.

680
01:01:36,779 --> 01:01:42,383
Like, you knew that was coming. So I do have
one thing to say about Queen Eldora secretly

681
01:01:42,443 --> 01:01:47,868
being the Skeleton Queen. They refer to this
character as two different names in the romantic

682
01:01:47,908 --> 01:01:54,353
episodes. Initially, they refer to her as the
Undead King, which I was like, what? Like,

683
01:01:54,714 --> 01:02:00,458
it's a woman character. Joker calls her Skeleton
Queen in the final episode. It was just confusing

684
01:02:00,518 --> 01:02:04,399
as to what was going on with this character.
I'm referring to her as the Skeleton Queen

685
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:10,162
in my notes. But yeah, she was also referred
to the undead king. Did you guys notice that?

686
01:02:10,782 --> 01:02:15,644
Yeah. And I was waiting for some kind of explanation.
Like, are they talking about the same person?

687
01:02:15,824 --> 01:02:21,547
Like, what the hell's going on here? But they
normally do that a lot in anime is a lot of

688
01:02:21,567 --> 01:02:29,062
people will have like code names that only certain
people know of and like who they are. So. I

689
01:02:29,082 --> 01:02:33,826
guess I wasn't too surprised by it. Okay. So
like say you're like an assassin and you know

690
01:02:33,866 --> 01:02:39,331
they call this assassin the silent one, but
you're still you know Jonathan Garcia. I feel

691
01:02:39,351 --> 01:02:44,977
like I was just honored with a nickname. I've
always wanted that before. The silent assassin,

692
01:02:45,017 --> 01:02:52,762
I'll take it. I've always called you silent
but deadly. It still works. I'll take either.

693
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:57,843
I'll take either. Moving on to episode 9, a
minister uses the thinking cap to brainwash

694
01:02:57,883 --> 01:03:03,585
several knights and turn them against the others.
Fiona discovers the real Eldora was killed

695
01:03:03,665 --> 01:03:08,286
and replaced by the Skeleton Queen who aims
to spread death before Cecile rescues her.

696
01:03:08,706 --> 01:03:14,288
Tired of cowering, Fiona assumes Harley's makeup
and baseball bat before knocking out the minister

697
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:20,169
and in his control. As the Skeleton Queen summons
skeletons to attack Eldora's subjects and floods

698
01:03:20,189 --> 01:03:26,167
the castle, Kroc attacks Fiona, but King Shark
escapes from his cell and intercepts him. The

699
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:31,048
rest of the squad soon arrive to help fight
the Skeleton Queen and the Rogue Squad. The

700
01:03:31,088 --> 01:03:36,190
Skeleton Queen calls on the Enchantress for
help, but Arthur has a growth spurt and joins

701
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:41,551
the seal in aiding Harley and Deadshot in fighting
her. Using a magic gem to enhance her gun,

702
01:03:41,971 --> 01:03:46,893
Harley defeats the Enchantress before interrogating
her, deducing that she stopped the Thinker

703
01:03:46,933 --> 01:03:52,487
from killing the others and is serving the because
so much she cares about is being held hostage.

704
01:03:52,867 --> 01:03:58,390
Meanwhile, Kitana lures Clayface and Flag to
a giant skeleton where a woman resembling the

705
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:04,813
Enchantress is being held in a magical bubble.
I love that scene with Clayface kind of explaining

706
01:04:04,893 --> 01:04:11,056
like, oh, a damsel in distress and a dragon
is always guarding something super, super valuable.

707
01:04:11,396 --> 01:04:16,138
And I was like, oh my God, this guy's hilarious.
Like. Just the way he describes the whole scene

708
01:04:16,158 --> 01:04:21,821
and he's like, it's my time to shine. And she's
like, relax, bro. The fact that he always thought

709
01:04:21,861 --> 01:04:26,784
he was the protagonist of the story, just so
endearing for the character. He's got that

710
01:04:26,824 --> 01:04:31,486
main character energy going. Yeah. Did they
show how King Shark escaped from the prison?

711
01:04:31,526 --> 01:04:36,129
Because the whole goal of the squad was to get
back to the castle so they could rescue King

712
01:04:36,149 --> 01:04:42,149
Shark from being executed. But we never got
to see King Shark in danger of being executed

713
01:04:42,209 --> 01:04:47,353
because all of a sudden he was just in the battle.
Well, the castle was being destroyed and flooded.

714
01:04:47,533 --> 01:04:52,177
I imagine he escaped during that point because
he emerged coming from the water. That makes

715
01:04:52,197 --> 01:04:56,580
sense. We didn't get to see it happened off
screen, but I imagine that's what happened.

716
01:04:56,600 --> 01:05:02,105
What about that water with Killer Croc surfing?
That was cool. On that water. I was like, that's

717
01:05:02,225 --> 01:05:08,954
so Ninja Turtles. I was like, I love it. I think
Killer Croc was better portrayed here in this

718
01:05:09,014 --> 01:05:13,435
series than he ever has been. I agree. That
includes like the movies he's been in, the

719
01:05:13,495 --> 01:05:16,436
old Batman television series and everything
like that. I thought he was, I thought he was

720
01:05:16,476 --> 01:05:21,197
pretty dope here. He was cool. He was very cool.
Like in other media, he's kind of depicted

721
01:05:21,357 --> 01:05:26,219
somewhat like King Shark is here, just eating
people and just like really strong. But in

722
01:05:26,259 --> 01:05:32,100
the show, he was like I mentioned earlier, much
more of a brawler, like a boxer. He was talented

723
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:37,041
in fighting, which I think is a cool angle.
Moving on to the final episode, episode 10.

724
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:42,675
Flagging Clayface rescue, the woman Wallakatana
destroys the skeleton, but the Enchantress

725
01:05:42,695 --> 01:05:47,497
feels whatever she feels and goes berserk from
pain. Peacemaker convinces the sea monster

726
01:05:47,537 --> 01:05:52,999
to turn on Krokk and eat him. Cecilia is wounded
and gives his enchanted armor to Deadshot,

727
01:05:53,059 --> 01:05:59,441
granting him enhanced abilities. The Enchantress
merges with June Moon. Now that she is free,

728
01:05:59,461 --> 01:06:04,671
she pays back the squad by fighting the skeletons.
Deadshot equips the rest of the squad except

729
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:09,655
Flag with pieces of the armor, enhancing their
powers so they can fight the Skeleton Queen.

730
01:06:09,975 --> 01:06:15,339
Harley and Fiona distract the Skeleton Queen
by disguising as each other before killing

731
01:06:15,379 --> 01:06:21,583
her. Fiona takes the throne and rewards the
squad with a feast. Flag calls Waller to report

732
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:27,247
what happened and that Katana disappeared. Confused
Waller says Katana was with her the whole time

733
01:06:27,668 --> 01:06:32,671
and it's revealed that the Joker entered the
Otherworld. and gained the power to shapeshift,

734
01:06:32,931 --> 01:06:38,535
masquerading as Katana among others to manipulate
the war for his own amusement. So out of all

735
01:06:38,575 --> 01:06:43,238
of the Super Saiyan powers that the squad got
when they donned the magic armor, who had the

736
01:06:43,258 --> 01:06:49,302
best? Clayface. Clayface is pretty dope with
the clay duplicates that he could create. Yeah,

737
01:06:49,442 --> 01:06:55,146
that and just how he just I don't know. I just
I like the fit. I love the fit. Yeah, that

738
01:06:55,166 --> 01:07:00,878
was good. Yeah. His cape and everything. Yeah.
That drip. Good. Exactly. Peacemaker was probably

739
01:07:00,898 --> 01:07:07,700
my favorite. That like sword gun thing was hella
cool. Yeah, it's very Final Fantasy. I really

740
01:07:07,740 --> 01:07:12,821
liked Harley Quinn's with the top hat and the
chains with the hyenas at the end that she

741
01:07:12,841 --> 01:07:16,302
could control and everything like that. I thought
that was pretty cool. Although the hyenas came

742
01:07:16,322 --> 01:07:21,704
out of nowhere. They were like magic manifestations,
I think. They were pretty cool. Yeah. That

743
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:26,105
end battle was so cool. Like I just had the
biggest smile on my face when they were all

744
01:07:26,285 --> 01:07:31,500
amped up with the armor. It was awesome. I was
like, man, this show is cool. When she started

745
01:07:31,540 --> 01:07:36,984
just literally piecing apart the Suicide Squad
and just taking them out one by one, sending

746
01:07:37,004 --> 01:07:42,288
them all flying, I was glued. I'm just like,
I can't look away. Like, I need to see every

747
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:48,493
single one of them get their ass kicked. And
when the dragon and Harley flew up towards

748
01:07:48,533 --> 01:07:53,157
her, I was like, wait a second, that's not Harley.
Like, in that moment is when I realized that

749
01:07:53,197 --> 01:07:58,141
they did the switch. And then all of a sudden
you see King Shark's belly get ripped open.

750
01:07:58,986 --> 01:08:04,069
and the sword fly out of it. I was like, oh,
I've totally forgot about that. Yeah, it was

751
01:08:04,109 --> 01:08:08,072
cool because Fionne was saying earlier, oh,
you know, she can only be defeated with the

752
01:08:08,112 --> 01:08:13,856
magic sword and it's lost. I totally forgot
that I was still in King Shark's stomach. So

753
01:08:13,916 --> 01:08:17,319
right when, you know, she was summoning the
sword to her and it came out of her. I was

754
01:08:17,339 --> 01:08:22,462
like, oh snap. It just all came together. It
was pretty awesome. I totally remembered that

755
01:08:22,482 --> 01:08:26,465
it was still in his stomach, and I was just
waiting for the moment that they pulled out

756
01:08:26,485 --> 01:08:29,843
of him again. I was surprised they didn't do
it sooner, but I guess they didn't really have

757
01:08:29,883 --> 01:08:34,625
a good opportunity to get up to the Skeleton
Queen prior to that point. So they needed that

758
01:08:34,646 --> 01:08:39,828
kind of deception where she wouldn't expect
Harley Quinn to wield the sword. So it made

759
01:08:39,868 --> 01:08:44,871
sense. It was a good moment though, for sure.
The end battle was just so well plotted and

760
01:08:44,911 --> 01:08:49,193
mapped out. Even with like the finishing blow
with Harley Quinn batting the Skeleton Queen's

761
01:08:49,253 --> 01:08:54,436
head off into the horizon and then, you know,
the sky turning from red to blue. It was majestic.

762
01:08:54,596 --> 01:08:59,467
I loved the way they did it. Yeah, no, that
was great. But that does it for the whole series.

763
01:08:59,907 --> 01:09:05,130
I had a lot of fun with it. It was not perfect.
There were some parts that didn't quite make

764
01:09:05,190 --> 01:09:11,473
sense, but overall I would say I definitely
recommend it. It's low stakes and somewhat

765
01:09:11,493 --> 01:09:16,956
confusing narrative. Don't really drag down
an otherwise fun and absurd anime actioner

766
01:09:17,136 --> 01:09:23,480
with a strong squad of characters and kinetic
visuals. I'm giving this three and a half out

767
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:29,563
of five stars a fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
Yeah, no, I totally agree with that. I mean,

768
01:09:29,843 --> 01:09:33,847
personally, I would probably give it a little
bit of a higher rating, but I came for the

769
01:09:33,887 --> 01:09:39,631
fights and the straight up animation and I thought
they hit the nail on the head with everything

770
01:09:39,651 --> 01:09:45,416
they did. But when you do break it down a little
bit more and you get into the actual story

771
01:09:45,456 --> 01:09:50,961
and the tropes and everything, it has been played
out quite often in many different stories that

772
01:09:50,981 --> 01:09:57,526
have been told. So, yeah, I could agree with
that. It's definitely fresh. I would agree

773
01:09:57,546 --> 01:10:03,388
with a 3.5 star rating. I enjoyed it. I think
it was definitely a successful anime adaptation

774
01:10:03,528 --> 01:10:09,790
of these American comic book characters. I commend
them for what they did with the action and

775
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:14,352
the animation and everything. I just wish that
maybe the story was a little bit tighter or

776
01:10:14,552 --> 01:10:18,853
coherent, I guess, fewer plot holes and stuff
like that, but there's still a lot to like

777
01:10:18,973 --> 01:10:24,489
within the show. Yeah, I mean, if you're showing
up for the action, you are going to leave pleased.

778
01:10:24,689 --> 01:10:30,653
If you're showing up for a coherent story, I
mean, maybe anime is not always best suited

779
01:10:30,693 --> 01:10:37,218
for that. Well, anime is very long form, right?
So they always do drop like little things here.

780
01:10:37,518 --> 01:10:42,081
And then, you know, maybe four seasons from
now, we'll get an answer on what the hell they

781
01:10:42,101 --> 01:10:47,085
were talking about in the first season. That's
right. That usually happens a lot in long running

782
01:10:47,165 --> 01:10:54,201
animes. So. I wouldn't really hold it against
it because again, most animes do that. So we'll

783
01:10:54,221 --> 01:10:59,725
probably get our answers very soon. I guess
my assumption while watching it was that this

784
01:10:59,805 --> 01:11:03,368
wasn't being set up for additional seasons.
I thought it was going to be kind of a contained

785
01:11:03,448 --> 01:11:06,890
story. I actually thought they were going to
get out of the Isekai by the final episode.

786
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:10,893
That was kind of my assumption. Just watching
it offhand. But you're right. They're definitely

787
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:15,136
playing the long game with this story. I hope
they are. I hope we get more seasons out of

788
01:11:15,216 --> 01:11:19,687
it. I hope a lot of people watch it and it becomes
successful. Because I do think, as we mentioned

789
01:11:19,747 --> 01:11:24,891
earlier, that this is probably the coolest version
of the Suicide Squad that has been translated

790
01:11:25,012 --> 01:11:30,997
onto the screen. As good as James Gunn's film
was, as cool as the characters looked in David

791
01:11:31,077 --> 01:11:36,902
Ayer's version, they don't top this. I would
agree. No, I agree. I totally agree. Yeah.

792
01:11:36,963 --> 01:11:42,247
But thanks for coming on board to review this
series with us, Zach. I can't imagine having

793
01:11:42,307 --> 01:11:47,315
done this review without your insight. I'll
tell you right now, you actually changed Jonathan's

794
01:11:47,355 --> 01:11:51,938
rating from three stars to three and a half
stars. Oh, wow. With your enthusiasm. And I

795
01:11:51,978 --> 01:11:56,842
think you just made both of us realize that
yeah, this is actually a solid show for sure.

796
01:11:57,242 --> 01:12:01,145
Awesome. Well, I appreciate you guys for having
me on. And yeah, that makes me happy that,

797
01:12:01,165 --> 01:12:05,668
you know, I just kind of got more people excited
for anime. Like that's my job. You know what

798
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:10,391
I mean? That's what I got to do. So. It worked.
It worked for sure. Don't forget, guys, to

799
01:12:10,471 --> 01:12:16,043
check out Zach's show, Sinjo World, part of
the Dynamite Network. And also stay tuned for

800
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:21,267
a new show that Zach is developing. And we'll
be announcing that later on our show. Senjoworld,

801
01:12:21,567 --> 01:12:26,492
it's great. I love being part of the Dynamite
Network. And this week, the battle that we

802
01:12:26,512 --> 01:12:32,697
have set up was actually pretty fun. Me and
my buddy DJ Tom had a pretty good time going

803
01:12:32,717 --> 01:12:38,722
back and forth with this battle. And in lieu
of last week's review, I'm doing a Sailor Moon

804
01:12:38,762 --> 01:12:43,719
versus Dragon Ball Z fight. Oh shit, nice. That's
pretty exciting. Super glad to have you as

805
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:47,607
part of the network. We'll have to have you
on again at some point in the future. Always

806
01:12:47,627 --> 01:12:51,876
great talking to you. And we'll talk to you
later. Sayonara. Well, that does it for the

807
01:12:51,916 --> 01:12:59,367
review. AJ9K, help close this out. Thanks for

01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:28,919
Senjow World and Console Combat. In our next
episode, as we mentioned earlier, we will be

813
01:13:28,979 --> 01:13:36,683
doing a team duel between DC's The Outsiders
team and Marvel's X-Force. That's going to

814
01:13:36,703 --> 01:13:41,426
be a lot of fun. X-Force is going to have characters
like Cable and Deadpool on it. And I think

815
01:13:41,446 --> 01:13:45,668
you guys are in for quite a treat, as all of
our team duel episodes are. And this is kind

816
