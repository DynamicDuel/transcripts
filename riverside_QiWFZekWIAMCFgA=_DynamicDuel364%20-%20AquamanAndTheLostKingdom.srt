00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,957
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,462 --> 00:00:29,784
Welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,824 --> 00:00:35,646
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters and stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:36,106 --> 00:00:42,829
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother Marvelous
Joe. And happy day after Christmas, everyone.

5
00:00:43,389 --> 00:00:47,571
It's Boxing Day. Oh yeah, that's right. Yeah,
in Canada, you guys celebrate that. To all

6
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:52,893
the Canadians, and wherever else they celebrate
that, Happy Boxing Day. In this episode...

7
00:00:53,238 --> 00:01:00,860
We will be doing a review of the latest DC film
to hit theaters. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.

8
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:08,862
Was it a worthwhile finale to the DCEU? No,
it was not. Let's just say that it makes me

9
00:01:08,982 --> 00:01:15,264
want to box James Wan on Boxing Day. I mean,
no disrespect to James Wan. Like he did his

10
00:01:15,324 --> 00:01:20,005
part. I feel like everyone else did not, though.
We'll get into all of our thoughts around the

11
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:24,038
film later on in the episode before that. We're
going to break down the comic book movie news

12
00:01:24,058 --> 00:01:29,180
from the past week, including the news that
Jonathan Majors has been fired from Marvel

13
00:01:29,401 --> 00:01:36,664
as Kang, and that Matt Reeves' Arkham series
is going to be set in James Gunn's DC Universe.

14
00:01:37,244 --> 00:01:40,485
As always, we list our segment times in our

to create peace on Earth, right? Usually they
want to take over the world like Skynet, like

00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:15,633
worthless. No, no, forget we said that. Delete.

But with that out of the way, quick to the no
prize! The No Prize is an award Marvel used

40
00:03:53,686 --> 00:03:58,448
to give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic
Dual No Prize, is a digital award we post on

41
00:03:58,548 --> 00:04:03,010
Instagram and in our email newsletter for the
person that we feel gave the best answer to

42
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:08,092
our question of the week. Last week we asked,
what has been your most favorite Marvel or

43
00:04:08,152 --> 00:04:14,095
DC related gift that you've received for the
holidays? And either it wasn't a great question

44
00:04:14,155 --> 00:04:19,577
or a lot of people have not received DC or Marvel
related gifts because we only got one answer.

45
00:04:19,657 --> 00:04:25,440
So The winner of this week's snow prize is Miggy
Mattingian, who said, Hey, what's up, guys?

46
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,704
Miggy and my favorite DC holiday gift that I
received was a Star Labs hoodie. I think you

47
00:04:31,744 --> 00:04:36,766
mentioned in a patron, like bonus episode or
maybe on the Discord server that you kind of

48
00:04:36,786 --> 00:04:41,649
missed it when superhero merch was kind of like
secret language between fans. And I kind of

49
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:45,511
felt that with this hoodie, because only like
fans of the show, people who had seen the show

50
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:50,706
would get the reference and compliment me for
it. So, yeah, thanks, guys. Yeah, of course,

51
00:04:50,766 --> 00:04:57,448
Star Labs featured heavily in the Flash television
series, of which Miggy was a huge fan. The

52
00:04:57,468 --> 00:05:01,869
Flash is one of his favorite characters as well.
And yeah, I've actually seen that hoodie. It's

53
00:05:01,889 --> 00:05:07,051
a pretty cool hoodie. I like the logo that they
came up with for Star Labs in that show. I

54
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:11,993
would want to own that hoodie. It's a dope gift.
Yeah, when it comes to superhero merch, I do

55
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:17,582
like the type of stuff that's... more inside
baseball, you know, like it's not outwardly

56
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:23,324
like a Spider-Man logo or something like that,
but it might be like Oz Corp, the Daily Bugle

57
00:05:23,384 --> 00:05:27,166
or something like that. That's how you separate
the true fans from, you know, the people who

58
00:05:27,246 --> 00:05:31,767
just know who Spider-Man is. Right, exactly.
It's like the deeper the cut, the bigger the

59
00:05:31,807 --> 00:05:35,408
fan. And I feel like Star Labs is a pretty deep
cut. You know, there's probably a lot of people

60
00:05:35,608 --> 00:05:38,849
out there that see Miggy wearing this hoodie
and think that he's a scientist or something.

61
00:05:39,242 --> 00:05:44,504
Which I think is hilarious, which also works,
you know, as double purpose. Yep. But congrats,

62
00:05:44,584 --> 00:05:47,866
Mickey, for winning this week's no prize. If
you're the listener, want a shot at winning

63
00:05:47,906 --> 00:05:52,769
your own no prize. Stay tuned to later on in
this episode, we'll be asking another question

64
00:05:52,789 --> 00:05:57,671
of the week. And as our schedule gets more regular
outside of the holidays, hopefully we'll get

65
00:05:57,751 --> 00:06:01,733
more of you guys to answer. And now that that's
done, onto the news.

66
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:13,179
Alright, this past week we learned that Jonathan
Majors has been fired by Marvel from his role

67
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:20,665
as Kang the Conqueror, which is huge news considering
that the entire multiversal saga for the MCU

68
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:27,691
was basically surrounding his character and
all the variants of Kang. So it's really unclear

69
00:06:27,731 --> 00:06:32,155
what's going to happen from this point on. It's
hard to know how to feel about this news because

70
00:06:32,215 --> 00:06:36,778
on one hand, you know, as a fan of Marvel movies...
You don't want to see any sort of break in

71
00:06:36,818 --> 00:06:41,921
continuity, whether or not Marvel recasts the
role or they choose to go with a different

72
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:47,763
villain as the main antagonist of this multiversal
saga. On the other hand, Majors was found guilty

73
00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:53,146
of two of the counts charged against him, including
harassment and assault. He was found not guilty

74
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:58,028
on two other counts, but these charges were
enough to basically force Marvel's hand to

75
00:06:58,068 --> 00:07:03,911
avoid any bad press that might come their way
by working with... a convicted criminal essentially.

76
00:07:04,051 --> 00:07:08,655
It's unlikely that Jonathan Majors will face
any actual jail time for this, but his career

77
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:14,580
is definitely severely damaged. Yeah, this is
actually kind of surprising news to me. I mean,

78
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,003
I could have seen Disney go either way with
this. I thought that because he was acquitted

79
00:07:19,043 --> 00:07:24,868
of the major charges, that they would probably
just try and keep him on board and ignore what

80
00:07:24,908 --> 00:07:30,833
had happened. But I guess Disney is in such
a rough place culturally and politically right

81
00:07:30,873 --> 00:07:36,599
now. that they really just didn't want to run
the risk of more bad press as it were. Yeah,

82
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:41,320
I mean, they're not DC. They're not going to
keep Ezra Miller around if he was working for

83
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,382
them, you know? Was Ezra Miller convicted? I
don't know. All I know is that dude's crazy.

84
00:07:46,902 --> 00:07:52,223
Oh yeah, he pled guilty to a misdemeanor. But
again, I mean, Jonathan Majors also got two

85
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:57,465
misdemeanors. So they're misdemeanors. They're
not felonies. You know, they could still vote.

86
00:07:58,005 --> 00:08:02,744
But they can't play king. The next time we were
supposed to see King of the Conqueror was going

87
00:08:02,784 --> 00:08:08,388
to be in the next Avengers movie, which was
gonna be called The King Dynasty. That movie

88
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:14,193
has since been retitled to just Avengers 5.
It's unclear what Marvel is going to choose

89
00:08:14,213 --> 00:08:21,640
to do with the character. I say recast. I mean,
so many Marvel roles have been recast. I don't

90
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,384
understand why I see so many people online saying
just do away completely with the character.

91
00:08:26,684 --> 00:08:31,623
I think a lot of that has to do with just the
dislike of the general direction for the MCU

92
00:08:31,663 --> 00:08:37,808
currently, but I kind of feel like to correct
that you need a character like Kang. Yeah,

93
00:08:37,928 --> 00:08:43,932
I mean you have a point there, but I just think
it would be bad optics for another actor. I

94
00:08:43,952 --> 00:08:47,574
don't think you'd be able to find another actor
who would want to replace Jonathan Majors in

95
00:08:47,594 --> 00:08:52,818
the role, considering that this whole thing
is fairly controversial. You know, it's hard

96
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:59,230
for I think another actor to appear like they're
taking advantage of someone I don't believe

97
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:04,731
that. I think if you spin it in a way where
it's like, hey, Jonathan Majors did something

98
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:09,712
wrong, not Kenny the Conqueror, who's still
a really cool character, and now this actor

99
00:09:09,732 --> 00:09:13,614
is going to play that really cool character.
I mean, it's not like DC is going to have a

100
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:17,795
hard time recasting the Flash. It's not like
an actor is not going to want to play the Flash

101
00:09:17,815 --> 00:09:22,856
because of Ezra Miller. I don't get that connection.
Well, I mean, that role is probably going to

102
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:30,791
be recast anyway, since DC is going into a new
universe. I don't know. It's hard to say. If

103
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:35,373
Marvel decided to not recast and instead focus
on a new villain, the only other villain I

104
00:09:35,393 --> 00:09:40,236
could think that they could use for this multiversal
saga would be Doctor Doom, because he is the

105
00:09:40,376 --> 00:09:45,359
one that patched together Battleworld in the
2015 Secret Invasion. I guess you could also

106
00:09:45,379 --> 00:09:50,161
go with the Beyonder, since the Beyonder was
the villain of the original Secret Wars story.

107
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:56,225
It's just like a lot of story to scrap. Like
I guess you could make the argument that Loki

108
00:09:56,325 --> 00:10:03,072
acting as the new Loom. that he resets the timeline
and maybe like erases all version of Kang,

109
00:10:03,633 --> 00:10:08,980
I find that hard to believe. I just don't think
you could scrap everything. Fair enough. So

110
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,884
I guess with that in mind, that brings us to
our question of the week.

111
00:10:16,406 --> 00:10:22,931
Which actor would you choose to recast Kang
in the MCU, and why? Yeah, I'm sure any new

112
00:10:23,012 --> 00:10:28,577
actor that comes into that role, if they do
recast, would be rationalized as simply a variant

113
00:10:28,757 --> 00:10:33,901
of the Kang character. So, at least it would
be an easy explanation. But record your answer

00:10:51,152 --> 00:10:57,173
and our email newsletter. Be sure to answer
before December 30th. In DC News, we learned

119
00:10:57,494 --> 00:11:03,815
that Matt Reeves' Batman Arkham series that's
in development will be set in James Gunn's

120
00:11:03,935 --> 00:11:09,577
and Peter Safran's DC universe. Of course, the
Arkham series was originally going to focus

121
00:11:09,657 --> 00:11:14,766
on the Gotham City Police Department. But I
guess Warner Brothers scrapped the idea and

122
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:19,728
Matt Reeves pitched an Arkham series instead,
which James Gunn and Peter Safran greenlit.

123
00:11:19,808 --> 00:11:25,149
According to Gunn on social media, the Arkham
series was always planned to be set in the

124
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:30,571
DCU and not part of any else world's universe
that Matt Reeves is working on. This is huge

125
00:11:30,631 --> 00:11:36,152
news because we initially believed that Matt
Reeves was establishing a series set within

126
00:11:36,432 --> 00:11:43,151
his Batman universe which stars Robert Pattinson.
Apparently, he will be developing Batman characters

127
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:49,135
for two different universes, and I'm not sure
how I feel about that. It is strange considering

128
00:11:49,215 --> 00:11:54,698
like the Penguin show that's coming out next
year is not going to be in the DCU, but that's

129
00:11:54,718 --> 00:12:00,121
spearheaded by Matt Reeves, who's also spearheading
this DCU Batman project. Right, exactly. So

130
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:03,583
essentially, he's going to be coming up with
like two different versions of the Riddler,

131
00:12:03,963 --> 00:12:08,979
two different versions of the Joker and the
Penguin and everything else. I was really hoping

132
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:14,724
when I first heard this news that this may be
James Gunn's way of just really trying to get

133
00:12:14,924 --> 00:12:22,111
Matt Reeves' Batman into the DCU. And that still
may be the case because maybe Matt Reeves won't

134
00:12:22,171 --> 00:12:26,555
like having to develop two different versions
of these Batman characters. But I guess we'll

135
00:12:26,595 --> 00:12:32,540
see. It could be fun considering that Matt Reeves'
Batman movie takes place in a much more grounded

136
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:38,664
reality of DC. So he works on these hyper realistic
versions as well as these more comic accurate

137
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:43,326
versions which I assume the DCU is going to
be a little bit more comic accurate and fantastical

138
00:12:43,627 --> 00:12:49,190
and not so grounded in reality. It sounds like
a fun challenge honestly. It sounds confusing

139
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:54,292
because like how many different jokers are there
going to be now? I mean I guess that was inevitable

140
00:12:54,352 --> 00:12:59,655
if James Gunn was going to develop his own version
regardless but the fact that it's Matt Reeves

141
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:04,674
doing versions for both universes just really
kind of bothers me. I don't understand why

142
00:13:04,734 --> 00:13:10,995
James Gunn would give Matt Reeves that much
say over a fairly integral part of the Batman

143
00:13:11,015 --> 00:13:15,837
character, his rogues as it were, when Matt
Reeves is already doing his own thing. Like

144
00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:22,699
does that make sense to you? No, but nothing
DC does ever make sense to me, so. Okay. I'm

145
00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:27,640
not surprised. They just make a lot of weird
decisions, you know? It's weird. Again, I'm

146
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:34,286
hoping this is some sort of brilliant manipulation
on behalf of James Gunn to get Maybe I should

147
00:13:34,326 --> 00:13:38,209
be working in this new universe because it's
so cool and my Batman could be there. But then

148
00:13:38,229 --> 00:13:43,193
you would have to have Robert Pattinson be a
bad dad in the Brave and the Bold movie, which

149
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:48,237
I'm fine with, honestly, like he's traveling
the world. He's meeting all these ladies. He's

150
00:13:48,277 --> 00:13:53,320
got lots of money. Maybe he knocks one of them
up. You never know. But like, is he old enough

151
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:58,604
to have a kid as old as Damien Wayne? As long
as he and Talia were both 18, sure.

152
00:14:01,762 --> 00:14:06,364
Sure, okay. So this seems like it's gonna be
good news for fans of the upcoming DCU and

153
00:14:06,464 --> 00:14:12,686
not necessarily great news for fans of Reeves
take on the Batman universe. I think it's honestly

154
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:17,588
a win-win for everybody because you know whether
you liked Matt Reeves' version of the Batman

155
00:14:17,628 --> 00:14:22,991
or not, you'll still get the villains for that
version of Batman and Matt Reeves' genius in

156
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:27,913
the DCU as well because the guy is a genius.
Yeah, he's pretty good. He's alright. You know

157
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:34,278
it in your heart to be true. But yeah, I guess
we'll see what happens with the Batman projects.

158
00:14:34,298 --> 00:14:39,867
We'll keep you guys updated as to any news that
we hear for the Batman series or anything coming

159
00:14:39,927 --> 00:14:41,309
from Matt Reeves and DC.

160
00:14:48,878 --> 00:14:52,942
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode. Now let's move on to the main

161
00:14:52,982 --> 00:14:59,589
event, where we review the latest DC film to
hit theaters, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom.

162
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:22,964
Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is the latest and
final film of the DC Extended Universe. I think.

163
00:15:23,525 --> 00:15:28,249
You know, after the Flash things are a little
bit grey now, but the film of course stars

164
00:15:28,289 --> 00:15:34,594
Jason Momoa and was directed by James Wan and
is the sequel to the billion dollar grossing

165
00:15:34,675 --> 00:15:42,081
2018 film Aquaman, which is the highest grossing
DC film of all time worldwide. And that film

166
00:15:42,101 --> 00:15:46,903
was good. I think it's one of the best DC films
ever, from a filmmaking perspective at the

167
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:52,426
very least. The film looked gorgeous, and the
mythic worldbuilding done by James Wan was

168
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:58,788
phenomenal. When we learned that a sequel was
planned for a December 2022 release, I was

169
00:15:58,848 --> 00:16:04,231
pretty excited. But then we got the Amber Heard
drama and the sudden purchase of Warner Bros.

170
00:16:04,251 --> 00:16:10,553
by Discovery. The new CEO said he wanted to
reboot DC. James Gunn took over DC Studios.

171
00:16:11,022 --> 00:16:16,765
and suddenly the Aquaman sequel lost quite a
bit of its luster. The film was pushed back

172
00:16:16,865 --> 00:16:22,929
a year due to COVID setbacks, and after the
Flash arrived in theaters, essentially allowing

173
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:30,653
for a fresh start to DC's new cinematic universe,
Aquaman 2 became my least anticipated DC film,

174
00:16:31,154 --> 00:16:36,797
maybe ever. Like, I would have been perfectly
fine if the film was shelved as a tax write-off

175
00:16:36,837 --> 00:16:41,587
like Batgirl. That all changed however when
we got the first trailer only three months

176
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:48,409
ago and I was reminded of how awesome the visuals
and the world that James Wan created are. I

177
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:55,210
got pretty hyped, but did the film live up to
the hype? It unfortunately did not. We didn't

178
00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:00,732
need this film, things should have ended with
the Flash, and I'm kinda just ready to forget

179
00:17:00,752 --> 00:17:06,790
this film even exists. It was mediocre times
for Superhero Movie going You know, it reminded

180
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:13,114
me a lot of Ant-Man and the Wasp quantumania
in that the film was almost essentially computer

181
00:17:13,194 --> 00:17:18,296
animated. There were so many visual effects
shots. The humor didn't always stick like quantumania

182
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:25,400
and the story was a little lackluster. I think
2023's Marvel and DC films were bookended by

183
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:31,464
some of the more generic offerings that DC Marvel
have put out. Which is a huge shame. If you

184
00:17:31,504 --> 00:17:37,548
haven't seen Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom yet.
Honestly, I wouldn't bother. Like maybe not

185
00:17:37,608 --> 00:17:42,172
even when this hits streaming. Not because the
film is terrible, because the third act is

186
00:17:42,252 --> 00:17:48,078
actually pretty good, but because it's ultimately
pointless and has very little redeeming value

187
00:17:48,278 --> 00:17:54,064
outside of CG spectacle. And even that is sometimes
amongst the worst I've seen in a long time.

188
00:17:54,524 --> 00:17:59,049
If you still want to see the film, definitely
skip this review though because there will

189
00:17:59,089 --> 00:18:04,555
be spoilers. Now the film picks up a few years
after the events of the first film, where Aquaman

190
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:10,417
defeated his brother Orm, the King of Atlantis,
to prevent him from amassing an army to destroy

191
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:15,918
the surface world. As Aquaman learned about
the world of Atlantis, he also developed a

192
00:18:15,978 --> 00:18:21,960
romantic relationship with Orm's former fiance,
Princess Mera. And between the two films, they

193
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,778
had a baby, Arthur Jr. And this is in keeping
with the comics. Aquaman is pretty unique in

194
00:18:27,818 --> 00:18:33,340
the comics in that he matured a lot faster than
other heroes. Like he was the first superhero

195
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,441
to have a wedding, the first to have a baby,
the first to suffer the loss of a child, and

196
00:18:39,461 --> 00:18:45,443
the first hero to get separated as a result.
It's pretty heavy stuff, and while the loss

197
00:18:45,483 --> 00:18:52,105
of his family didn't drive him in the same way
it did the Punisher, it still deeply affected

198
00:18:52,145 --> 00:18:57,627
him and it took decades for him and Mara to
reunite. Yeah, the comic book version of Aquaman

199
00:18:57,787 --> 00:19:02,251
is pretty deep It's interesting that you say
that he was one of the first characters to

200
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:08,257
kind of mature in his I guess life story And
of all the DC superheroes, it's ironic because

201
00:19:08,417 --> 00:19:14,722
Jason Momoa's version of the Aquaman character
is Essentially a manchild. Oh, yeah, I'll definitely

202
00:19:14,742 --> 00:19:19,507
be getting to that. Absolutely You're on the
nose there. It just served to remind me again

203
00:19:19,547 --> 00:19:24,151
while watching this movie that this doesn't
really feel like Aquaman that I know. It's

204
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:30,376
very much Jason Momoa's take on the character.
Or just Jason Momoa. Like not even a take on

205
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:36,901
a character. It's just Jason Momoa. Now it had
been rumored that Aquaman 2 tested horribly

206
00:19:37,222 --> 00:19:43,227
at test screenings, in part because Black Manta
killed Arthur Jr. just like in the comics.

207
00:19:43,647 --> 00:19:49,732
Like people walked out of test screenings, which
is unheard of. But I could kind of see where

208
00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:54,603
they're coming from now. One of the things I
was most interested in going into the film

209
00:19:54,943 --> 00:20:00,186
was to see if the filmmakers had the balls to
put Aquaman through such an emotionally heavy

210
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:05,929
and dark ordeal like suffering the loss of a
child. I thought I saw a way they could have

211
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:11,312
done it in a similar way to the movie Gladiator
that could have suited the narrative and the

212
00:20:11,352 --> 00:20:17,736
film. But now it's become painfully obvious
that Jason Momoa is no Russell Crowe. Like

213
00:20:17,776 --> 00:20:23,927
tonally, I'd say Jason Momoa ruined the film.
I understand it's hard to take a character

214
00:20:24,327 --> 00:20:32,272
like Aquaman seriously, but damn, you have to
at least try. I think Momoa probably assumed

215
00:20:32,352 --> 00:20:37,895
that the reason the first film made so much
money was because people enjoyed seeing Jason

216
00:20:37,935 --> 00:20:43,658
Momoa play Jason Momoa, who comes across as
somewhat of a jokester. But no, we just want

217
00:20:43,678 --> 00:20:49,762
to see Aquaman as a badass, and it's not badass
to have your baby piss in your mouth. or make

218
00:20:49,922 --> 00:20:55,965
unfunny jokes every five seconds. Yeah, actually,
my favorite moments with Jason Momoa as the

219
00:20:55,985 --> 00:21:00,308
character of Aquaman are his more serious moments
where he's acting like the character that I

220
00:21:00,328 --> 00:21:03,970
know from the comics, where he's very straight
faced. Like in the first movie, we got some

221
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:09,373
great character moments where he's seemingly
transitioning from his man child self into

222
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:14,356
someone you would believe as a king of this
entire kingdom. But there was almost like a

223
00:21:14,436 --> 00:21:20,758
reversion or a lack. of follow through in his
character arc from the first film where we

224
00:21:20,778 --> 00:21:25,662
don't really see that noble king. But like there
are brief spurts here, but like he's falling

225
00:21:25,723 --> 00:21:30,027
asleep during meetings and stuff like that.
It's all really played for gags. And it's not

226
00:21:30,067 --> 00:21:35,572
that funny. No, the only thing he didn't do
in this movie is like fart, but he may as well

227
00:21:35,592 --> 00:21:42,154
have. Now the film was intentionally supposed
to be message heavy. like showing the power

228
00:21:42,194 --> 00:21:48,259
of brotherhood and cooperation and warning against
the dangers of climate change and global warming.

229
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:54,765
But because the movie doesn't take itself seriously,
it's really hard to take its messages seriously.

230
00:21:55,425 --> 00:22:01,090
This film was originally supposed to go head-to-head
against Avatar the Way of Water, and when Warner

231
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:06,006
Brothers flinched and pushed the release date,
I was kind of pissed, like, ah, come on! No

232
00:22:06,046 --> 00:22:10,907
one cares about Avatar anymore. The first Aquaman
improved to what the first Avatar film did

233
00:22:10,947 --> 00:22:16,449
visually. Anyway, we could take him on. And
holy shit, was I wrong. Aquaman 2 was embarrassing

234
00:22:16,509 --> 00:22:22,070
enough without having to compare it to Avatar
2. But what's really heartbreaking was that

235
00:22:22,331 --> 00:22:27,912
there was this potential there for that to not
be the case. Like, I was expecting this film

236
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:33,882
to be like Avatar meets Taken meets Lord of
the Rings. but instead I got Thor Love and

237
00:22:33,902 --> 00:22:39,324
Thunder meets Jumanji meets the Saturday morning
Captain Planet cartoon. And the thing is, the

238
00:22:39,344 --> 00:22:45,646
film is so tonally inconsistent and it comes
across as so heavily edited and reworked that

239
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:50,287
I'm guessing there's a better version of the
movie out there, but I honestly don't care

240
00:22:50,307 --> 00:22:55,469
enough to hashtag release the wand cut. That
was a great description of this movie. Chris

241
00:22:55,509 --> 00:23:01,462
Hemsworth, despite the terrible quality of Thor
11th Thunder. He actually has comedic timing

242
00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:06,104
and comedic instincts. I don't think Jason Momoa
has the same thing going for him. I would somewhat

243
00:23:06,164 --> 00:23:11,285
agree. I think he has a little bit there, but
it needs to be under the right circumstances,

244
00:23:11,705 --> 00:23:17,607
which makes me nervous for a potential Lobo
project. Oh, I'm not worried about Lobo at

245
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:21,988
all. I think he would nail it because he basically
is Lobo, even when he's Aquaman. You know,

246
00:23:22,008 --> 00:23:27,269
you see, we still see him doing donuts in the
dirt with the motorcycle, despite the fact

247
00:23:27,309 --> 00:23:32,343
that I've never seen Aquaman ride a motorcycle
in the books. I'm trying to think. No, yeah,

248
00:23:32,363 --> 00:23:38,384
I think that'd be really dumb if I saw him ever
do that. Now I'm trashing the film, but just

249
00:23:38,424 --> 00:23:44,026
because I was disappointed in it doesn't mean
it was all bad. The film, as the trailers promised,

250
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:49,988
was gorgeous, despite some really embarrassing
CG in some spots. For the most part, it was

251
00:23:50,048 --> 00:23:57,178
good. And you know, once Arthur and Orm meet
Dr. Shin, the movie starts getting good. Because

252
00:23:57,218 --> 00:24:02,701
that's when we finally understand the stakes
of the film. That the entity controlling Black

253
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:09,346
Manta, Kordax, and the Oricalcum are global
threats. And we circle back to Arthur Jr. who

254
00:24:09,386 --> 00:24:13,608
gets kidnapped by Black Manta, which I thought
was going to happen much earlier in the film.

255
00:24:13,949 --> 00:24:19,732
The problem is that by the time the movie gets
good, it's like two-thirds over, and ultimately

256
00:24:19,772 --> 00:24:23,883
it's too little too late. Yeah, I actually thought
the plot was pretty interesting once it was

257
00:24:23,923 --> 00:24:27,966
revealed that the Oro Kalkom, and I swear to
God, if I ever hear that word again, it'll

258
00:24:27,986 --> 00:24:35,471
be too soon. But basically it was causing global
warming to melt the polar ice caps to free

259
00:24:35,651 --> 00:24:41,095
the lost kingdom and Kordax. Right, exactly.
The visuals, while the CGI may not have always

260
00:24:41,115 --> 00:24:47,859
been spot on, the design of everything is exceptional.
Like seeing Kordax with his Sauron like get

261
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:52,375
up, use his black magic on his Citadel and stuff
like that. Just the fact that the seventh kingdom

262
00:24:52,415 --> 00:24:56,998
was even based in Antarctica and had like this
entirely different world feel to the other

263
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:01,581
seven kingdoms, which we've seen in the previous
movie. It's all fantastic. Oh yeah, it's so

264
00:25:01,661 --> 00:25:06,485
well imagined. It's kind of a shame that it's
not going to continue. Honestly, that's like

265
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:11,148
what's heartbreaking in regards to Aquaman with
the DCU ending is that are we ever going to

266
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:15,811
see this world again? I like the sunken city
with all the pirates, like how that's like

267
00:25:15,851 --> 00:25:20,955
the underground in the oceanic world. That was
cool. I did love how this film traversed the

268
00:25:20,975 --> 00:25:25,557
globe in the way that the first film was a globe
trotting adventure. Like we got to see the

269
00:25:25,637 --> 00:25:31,320
desert, we got to see the jungle, we got to
see, you know, the sunken city and Antarctica.

270
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,583
It was pretty cool. The desert characters were
really cool in that they learned how to survive

271
00:25:36,663 --> 00:25:41,806
away from water by hydrating with blood. Like
that's pretty hardcore. That's super hardcore.

272
00:25:41,846 --> 00:25:47,649
And those creatures that they were riding were
super freaking disgusting. But like in the

273
00:25:47,689 --> 00:25:53,631
best way possible. Ultimately, I think these
visuals and these designs are like 90% of why

274
00:25:53,872 --> 00:25:59,454
I enjoyed this film. Oh, you enjoyed it? I mean,
it wasn't great. It definitely wasn't terrible,

275
00:25:59,494 --> 00:26:04,957
though. It was really hard for me to enjoy it.
I invited my father-in-law to see it with me.

276
00:26:05,437 --> 00:26:11,239
He's former military and I thought it'd be like
a cool like bro film to go see. And I was super

277
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:17,094
embarrassed. It was two Saturday morning cartoons
for him, right? Absolutely. Yeah. But let's

278
00:26:17,134 --> 00:26:22,619
move on to the character breakdown, starting
with Arthur Curry slash Aquaman played by Jason

279
00:26:22,639 --> 00:26:27,643
Momoa. As I mentioned earlier, I feel like he
ruined the movie in the same way that I feel

280
00:26:27,663 --> 00:26:33,588
like Chris Hemsworth ruined Thor, Love and Thunder
by trying to be a comedian. Thor is not supposed

281
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:38,612
to be a funny character. Neither is Aquaman.
I'm really tired of actors playing roles that

282
00:26:38,632 --> 00:26:44,457
they don't understand. And yeah, I'm going to
make the case that Jason Momoa doesn't understand

283
00:26:44,597 --> 00:26:49,847
Aquaman. Because, like we mentioned earlier,
he plays him like Lobo, so maybe ultimately

284
00:26:49,987 --> 00:26:55,348
it's best he's rumored to be playing that role
in James Gunn's new DCU. In the first film,

285
00:26:55,688 --> 00:27:01,110
Aquaman's arc was that he was worthy to be king
because he was able to make tough decisions.

286
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:06,811
But it turned out that upon being king, he really
wasn't able to make decisions to improve the

287
00:27:06,851 --> 00:27:12,973
kingdom due to the bureaucracy of Atlantis'
High Council, who antagonized him for not understanding

288
00:27:13,093 --> 00:27:19,333
Atlantean ways and culture. When sickness spreads
among his people, however, and Black Mantis

289
00:27:19,373 --> 00:27:25,678
steals or a calcum from Atlantis, polluting
the planet, Arthur realizes that he needs his

290
00:27:25,718 --> 00:27:32,063
brother's help to stop him. Even though Arthur
proved to be less kingly and less mature than

291
00:27:32,243 --> 00:27:39,148
Orm, he proved to be the bigger and better man
by surmounting and helping Orm overcome Kordax's

292
00:27:39,188 --> 00:27:44,684
temptations of power. Arthur's ultimate destiny
has always been to unite the underwater and

293
00:27:44,724 --> 00:27:50,228
surface worlds and at the very end of the film
he was finally able to start that process by

294
00:27:50,288 --> 00:27:56,052
revealing Atlantis's existence to the world,
though again how anyone is supposed to take

295
00:27:56,072 --> 00:28:02,076
him seriously with that weird mic drop at the
end is beyond me. The whole Iron Man callback

296
00:28:02,256 --> 00:28:08,360
was literally the worst fucking joke in any
DC film ever. I hated it when he was like,

297
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:14,817
I'm the king of Atlantis and I'm Aquaman. I
was like, what the fuck? What is this? My reaction

298
00:28:14,877 --> 00:28:18,480
exactly. I bet you world leaders were like,
oh, no.

299
00:28:21,562 --> 00:28:26,426
Right. That's what I'm saying. The coolest thing
for Aquaman, I would say, in this film was

300
00:28:26,487 --> 00:28:31,531
his stealth suit. I actually really liked the
way they did that. And I loved that Toppo also

301
00:28:31,551 --> 00:28:38,116
had essentially the same ability. We did not
get enough Toppo and Storm in this movie. Yeah.

302
00:28:38,136 --> 00:28:42,571
When you saw his fish speak. power at the end
of the first film, he almost seems like unstoppable

303
00:28:42,691 --> 00:28:47,054
in the water, right? So I was kind of hoping
that he would use it more within the course

304
00:28:47,074 --> 00:28:52,397
of this film, but he only really used it a few
times. Although I did like how he got all the

305
00:28:52,617 --> 00:28:58,000
undersea mammals to use their echolocation to
destroy Black Manta's ship. Oh yeah, like the

306
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,943
sonar waves. That was a really cool way to use
his power for sure. Moving on to Ocean Master,

307
00:29:04,084 --> 00:29:11,755
aka Orm, he was played by Patrick Wilson. Watching
this made me wish Patrick Wilson was originally

308
00:29:11,795 --> 00:29:16,116
cast as Aquaman because he not only looks the
part of the character from the comics to a

309
00:29:16,216 --> 00:29:22,017
T, but also because he took his role seriously.
I mean, he took part in quite a bit of the

310
00:29:22,077 --> 00:29:26,259
jokes, but even when he's running with his arms
behind his back because, you know, he doesn't

311
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:32,660
know how to run on land, or he's eating a cockroach,
like he still played it as if it was Orm, not

312
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:38,274
Patrick Wilson. I think Jason Mowa's presence
actually brought down Patrick Wilson's performance

313
00:29:38,574 --> 00:29:43,117
because whenever they were on screen together,
it became apparent that Patrick Wilson was

314
00:29:43,297 --> 00:29:49,520
acting because Jason Momoa wasn't, if that makes
sense. The two just had like zero bromance

315
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:54,003
chemistry, which is a problem for the film because
that was sort of supposed to be the core of

316
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:59,346
it, their relationship, and the entire second
act was supposed to be a buddy comedy. Yeah,

317
00:29:59,366 --> 00:30:03,228
that was my big takeaway from the film as well.
They were honestly acting in different films.

318
00:30:04,248 --> 00:30:08,720
It felt that way. Yeah, absolutely. And some
of that awkwardness, I feel like, was actually

319
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:14,004
reflected in the score. Because when they tried
to be silly with that relationship, the score

320
00:30:14,024 --> 00:30:19,129
did like a cartoonish thing such as when Aquaman
knocked over that big statue to create a bridge.

321
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:23,753
That scene played out way worse than I thought
it would from the trailers. And I don't know

322
00:30:23,774 --> 00:30:29,339
why, it was just so cringe-worthy. The whole
fucking jungle island thing was so cringe-inducing.

323
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:34,823
I didn't get the joke regarding the cockroaches.
Actually, I did find that funny because you

324
00:30:34,843 --> 00:30:39,828
could just see me doing that to my younger brothers.
But he told him that it was like the shrimp

325
00:30:39,848 --> 00:30:45,633
of the land, right? Right. But the joke is that
surface dwellers don't actually eat cockroaches.

326
00:30:46,154 --> 00:30:50,538
And so he like tricked him into doing it, but
he never told him that it was a joke. Like

327
00:30:50,778 --> 00:30:56,604
he never followed through with the gag. So it
was just strange. Honestly, if I got you to

328
00:30:56,644 --> 00:31:00,378
eat a cockroach, I wouldn't tell you. that like
you're not supposed to eat it. I'd be telling

329
00:31:00,438 --> 00:31:06,202
everyone else that I got you to eat a cockroach.
And so we didn't see that either. We should

330
00:31:06,222 --> 00:31:11,805
have seen Alcon be like, I seriously got Oram
to eat a cockroach. We should have definitely.

331
00:31:12,265 --> 00:31:17,508
Now, Oram's arc in the film is really one in
which he comes to terms that what he did in

332
00:31:17,528 --> 00:31:24,852
the first film was wrong and that in the end,
Arthur really is better for Atlantis. He realizes

333
00:31:24,932 --> 00:31:30,071
over the course of the film, as Arthur continues
to surprise him, that there is an honor and

334
00:31:30,171 --> 00:31:36,856
nobility in Arthur's viewpoint and gracious
actions, and Orm is moved essentially. Part

335
00:31:36,877 --> 00:31:41,881
of me wanted to take issue with the fact that
Orm became a good guy and I kept waiting for

336
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:45,264
him to turn bad, but that ended up not happening.
I thought that would have been a great turn.

337
00:31:45,684 --> 00:31:51,569
But given the fact that you have stated that
Ocean Master actually has done good things

338
00:31:51,589 --> 00:31:55,733
in the books like relinquish the throne when
he realized that it rightfully belonged to

339
00:31:55,813 --> 00:32:01,247
Arthur Curry. That kind of helped sell the idea
of Oram being a good guy. To me. No, for me

340
00:32:01,327 --> 00:32:07,709
as well. Yeah. In the comics, in the new 52
version of Oram, he's not necessarily a bad

341
00:32:07,749 --> 00:32:13,690
guy. There is sort of like a rivalry, but there's
also like a respect between the characters

342
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:18,572
of Aquaman and Ocean Master as well. And so,
yeah, I thought it worked in the movie also.

343
00:32:19,012 --> 00:32:25,293
Moving on to David Kane, AKA Black Manta. He
was played by Yaya Abdul-Mateen the second.

344
00:32:25,974 --> 00:32:31,716
Black Manta is a fantastic character and I thought
Yaya did a fantastic job in the role because

345
00:32:31,736 --> 00:32:37,379
he's really able to capture the rage of the
character. Like very few villains are as dedicated

346
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:43,122
as Black Manta in the comics to so completely
destroying a hero and his family. And that

347
00:32:43,142 --> 00:32:48,064
also helps that he looks really badass. I do
have to say though it's kind of unfortunate

348
00:32:48,104 --> 00:32:54,440
that Black Manta loses some agency doing Cordax's
bidding in this film rather than going full

349
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,563
force against Aquaman. I say kind of because
I did actually like the dead king Cordax in

350
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:06,306
this film and giving Black Manta a reason to
kill Arthur Jr. other than he just really hates

351
00:33:06,406 --> 00:33:12,590
Aquaman was a more stomachable decision at the
very least. I did think it was somewhat baller

352
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:17,433
of him at the end, however, to essentially kill
himself maybe rather than accept Aquaman's

353
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:22,500
help because that felt very in character for
Black Manta. Yeah, that was his best character

354
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:26,784
moment. Unfortunately, it was probably his last
character moment. Yeah, yeah, I think it was.

355
00:33:26,824 --> 00:33:32,528
You're right. We talked about the design of
this film. I thought his new gear was incredibly

356
00:33:32,568 --> 00:33:38,413
well designed. You know, everything from the
suit to the octopods. It was fantastic. I liked

357
00:33:38,453 --> 00:33:43,117
seeing his beams in action that first seen when
he's going up against Mira and he like blasts

358
00:33:43,137 --> 00:33:47,320
her and like everything around him. Those are
some deadly lasers. Oh, yeah. Like you could

359
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:52,246
see how they were burning people. Definitely
deadly. So Aquaman, Ocean Master, and Black

360
00:33:52,286 --> 00:33:56,788
Manta are really the three central characters
of the film. I do want to touch briefly on

361
00:33:56,868 --> 00:34:02,429
Dr. Shin and Mara, though. Starting with Dr.
Shin, he was played by Randall Park, who's

362
00:34:02,469 --> 00:34:07,731
a great comedic actor. He was the only truly
funny character in the film, and at times when

363
00:34:07,771 --> 00:34:12,192
I don't think he was even trying to be. I mean,
I only see him as Jimmy Woo from the Marvel

364
00:34:12,212 --> 00:34:19,778
movies. Nah. This was just Jimmy Woo pretending
to be a scientist or something. I was happy

365
00:34:19,798 --> 00:34:24,019
with the amount of screen time that they gave
Randall Park here. Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

366
00:34:24,499 --> 00:34:28,880
You know, the first film, Dr. Shin was a minor
character, simply trying to prove Atlantis'

367
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,802
existence to the world and allied himself with
Black Manta to do so. Like you said, he got

368
00:34:33,902 --> 00:34:38,443
much more screen time here and he got more than
he bargained for with the emergence of Cortex.

369
00:34:39,123 --> 00:34:44,305
But he has a crisis of conscience warning Aquaman
of Black Manta's new power and even saving

370
00:34:44,385 --> 00:34:49,481
Arthur Jr. from being killed. So it was nice
to see him sort of have that heroic streak

371
00:34:49,501 --> 00:34:55,447
to him. Moving on to Mera, she was played by
Amber Heard. She had a slightly bigger role

372
00:34:55,467 --> 00:35:00,192
in the film than I thought she would, you know,
based on her own words in court that she was

373
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:05,057
essentially erased from the movie, which wasn't
the case, though there may be quite a bit left

374
00:35:05,097 --> 00:35:10,431
on the cutting-groom floor. I didn't think her
performance was terrible. Her involvement in

375
00:35:10,451 --> 00:35:15,955
the film's story was a big question to many
due to some reports that her relationship with

376
00:35:16,015 --> 00:35:21,460
Jason Momoa and James Wan wasn't great, but
I'm glad she got the screen time that she did

377
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:27,185
because Mera should be a big part of Arthur's
world, especially when it comes to Arthur Jr.

378
00:35:27,585 --> 00:35:32,069
It's always cool to see her use her powers too.
She has a musical power set. I mean, in this

379
00:35:32,089 --> 00:35:38,274
film it was used as Deus Ex Machina on multiple
occasions, which was kind of unfortunate. I

380
00:35:38,314 --> 00:35:43,216
actually would have preferred to see Toppo get
just one surprise Deo 6 Machina if you're going

381
00:35:43,236 --> 00:35:47,237
to do Deo 6 Machina because you know, you could
be invisible and just kind of like spring into

382
00:35:47,317 --> 00:35:51,579
action and be like, ta-da, I'm here. That would
have been awesome. I did like the call out

383
00:35:51,699 --> 00:35:55,241
that Nicole Kidman's Atlanta gave the character
in reference to the previous film where we

384
00:35:55,281 --> 00:35:58,842
saw Toppo playing the drums. Yeah. She was like
running down his credentials and she's like,

385
00:35:59,022 --> 00:36:04,905
he's also really good at multiple instruments.
Nicole Kidman looked so weird in this movie.

386
00:36:05,285 --> 00:36:10,307
She had a CGI face, did she not? Did she? I
don't think she did. That's how it looked to

387
00:36:10,347 --> 00:36:14,810
me on the screen that I saw. It looked like
maybe she had gotten too much Botox and couldn't

388
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:20,213
really move her face enough. And so they had
to move it using special effects. It very much

389
00:36:20,253 --> 00:36:26,376
looked like how Henry Cavill did in the Jostas
League movie. Oh, geez. I did not see that

390
00:36:26,656 --> 00:36:31,999
at all. She had a very small role in the movie.
She only had like a few lines. So maybe I just

391
00:36:32,099 --> 00:36:37,858
wasn't paying too much attention to her. But
I mean, I believe it. Let's move on to the

392
00:36:37,878 --> 00:36:38,587
story highlights.

393
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:50,491
Several years after defeating and imprisoning
his half-brother Orm, Arthur has become the

394
00:36:50,551 --> 00:36:56,112
new king of Atlantis and struggles with the
bureaucracy, preferring to spend time on land

395
00:36:56,132 --> 00:37:02,234
with his family, including his infant son Junior,
who displays the ability to communicate with

396
00:37:02,294 --> 00:37:08,056
fish. Aquaman's nemesis Black Manta, meanwhile,
searches the world for Atlantean technology

397
00:37:08,096 --> 00:37:13,457
to repair his power suit and get revenge on
the hero for killing his father. With the help

398
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:19,485
of Dr. Steven Shin, Black Manta finds the lost
Atlantean kingdom of Necrus in the Antarctic,

399
00:37:19,845 --> 00:37:24,850
where they're attacked by an underwater monster
and Black Manta becomes possessed by a broken

400
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:31,015
Black Trident. Now I'm not sure why they gave
Junior fish speaking powers, because it never

401
00:37:31,035 --> 00:37:36,419
came up in the film again. Like they should
have used it again at least once. Yeah, that

402
00:37:36,519 --> 00:37:40,182
actually would have been cool to have him save
the day by calling in a fleet of whales or

403
00:37:40,222 --> 00:37:44,918
something. Right? Yeah, absolutely. They could
have totally done that. And I actually thought

404
00:37:44,938 --> 00:37:49,180
they were going to once they sort of set that
up at the beginning of the movie. I actually

405
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,043
really liked these opening Antarctica scenes
because they were a good showcase for James

406
00:37:54,083 --> 00:37:59,767
Bond's horror background. Yeah, that tentacle
monster was pretty frightening. Yeah, and the

407
00:37:59,787 --> 00:38:04,710
way it just like dragged people into the darkness.
It was pretty cool. Within the next five months,

408
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:11,013
global warming has increased rapidly, diluting
the ocean saltwater and resulting in algae

409
00:38:11,033 --> 00:38:16,077
blooms. that's causing sickness to spread in
the underwater kingdoms. Although Arthur wants

410
00:38:16,117 --> 00:38:21,242
to reveal Atlantis to the surface world so that
their scientists can work together to solve

411
00:38:21,262 --> 00:38:26,906
the climate crisis, the city's high council
refuses to let him. Meanwhile, Black Manta,

412
00:38:27,127 --> 00:38:32,731
now equipped with new Atlantean technology,
is caught trying to steal a highly toxic fuel

413
00:38:32,791 --> 00:38:39,897
source known as or a calcum from Atlantis. Mera
and many other Atlanteans are badly injured.

414
00:38:40,158 --> 00:38:45,682
in Black Manta's escape. Do you know if Orocalcum
is from the comics? It is actually, but it's

415
00:38:45,762 --> 00:38:51,646
also from ancient myths about Atlantis as well.
It's supposed to be a medal though, I believe.

416
00:38:52,066 --> 00:38:57,610
Interesting. Upon realizing that Black Manta
is using the Orocalcum to pollute the Earth's

417
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:03,975
atmosphere and raise temperatures, Arthur decides
his brother Orm can help him find Black Manta,

418
00:39:04,315 --> 00:39:09,990
to his mother Atlantis and Mira's father Nerus'
objections. With the help of a stealth suit

419
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:15,873
and a cephalopod named Toppo, Arthur successfully
breaks Orm out of his desert prison. Which

420
00:39:15,913 --> 00:39:20,975
was a pretty cool scene. It was a convincing
special effect that they used on Patrick Wilson,

421
00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:26,317
going from his skinny mode into his ripped mode.
See, I didn't really like that. I mean, I thought

422
00:39:26,337 --> 00:39:31,159
the special effect was fine, but I don't understand
how just upon touching water, all of a sudden

423
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:37,018
he gets ripped. Well, he was like super dehydrated,
right? Yeah, I guess. I don't know. I just

424
00:39:37,038 --> 00:39:41,120
thought it was a convincing special effect.
Yeah, definitely convincing. As was Toppo.

425
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:47,043
I want a Toppo in real life. How was Toppo surviving
on land? Because he's fucking Toppo, dude.

426
00:39:47,424 --> 00:39:52,947
You can do whatever he wants. All right. OK.
How dare you question him. We need to do a

427
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:58,130
Christmas duel episode with Toppo. That's all
I'm saying. It's a great idea. Yeah. Orb suggests

428
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:03,072
that they visit the Sunken Citadel, a seedy
underwater pirate colony ruled by Kingfish,

429
00:40:03,372 --> 00:40:09,392
who may know Black Manta's whereabouts. After
a tussle with Kingfish's shark soldiers, Arthur

430
00:40:09,412 --> 00:40:15,075
learns that Black Manta may be on a volcanic
island in the South Pacific. After swimming

431
00:40:15,155 --> 00:40:21,038
to the island, Arthur sends Toppo back to Atlantis
for help while he and Orm navigate the mutated

432
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:27,322
jungle, dodging carnivorous plants and giant
insects to get to Black Manta's volcano base.

433
00:40:27,902 --> 00:40:32,365
I was super surprised when I saw that Kingfish
was voiced by Martin Short. Yeah, I didn't

434
00:40:32,385 --> 00:40:37,279
see that until the credits either. I have no
idea who Kingfish is. Apparently he's a character

435
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:41,881
in the comics. I initially thought that the
character was a stand in for King Shark, which

436
00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:46,282
I thought would have been actually really cool
if they had done that. But upon doing further

437
00:40:46,322 --> 00:40:52,125
research, I guess that wasn't the case. I always
liked the Jules Verne-esque journey to the

438
00:40:52,165 --> 00:40:56,687
center of the earth aspect that the Aquaman
films have. We saw that in the first movie

439
00:40:56,707 --> 00:40:59,928
where they actually did go to the center of
the earth. And then we saw it with this island

440
00:40:59,968 --> 00:41:05,294
in this film where you have like these giant
insect creatures and dangerous flora and stuff

441
00:41:05,314 --> 00:41:10,577
like that. It is a pretty neat aspect of these
films. Yeah, it kind of feels like James Wan

442
00:41:10,597 --> 00:41:14,680
can do whatever he wants in these movies. He
just comes up with these brilliant ways of

443
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:20,743
doing them. Like Oric Alcom mutating the environment,
that's a pretty cool idea to create some conflict.

444
00:41:21,243 --> 00:41:26,947
And it also creates greater stakes for the film
and the danger that Oric Alcom presents. There

445
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:31,189
was another joke during this part of the film
that I really did not appreciate and that was

446
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:39,140
when Aquaman referred to Orm as Loki and I'm
like shut the hell up What are you doing? He's

447
00:41:39,161 --> 00:41:43,682
trying to be like Tony Stark giving everybody
nicknames like how Iron Man did in the Avengers

448
00:41:43,722 --> 00:41:50,225
movie the first one But like do Marvel movies
exist in the DCEU they must and that's stupid

449
00:41:50,685 --> 00:41:55,287
Well, I mean apparently DC heroes exist in the
Marvel Cinematic Universe because there have

450
00:41:55,307 --> 00:42:00,429
been a number of references to Batman and Superman
Oh, that's right. Okay, unless angry about

451
00:42:00,469 --> 00:42:06,170
it now Now, uneasy with Black Manta's actions
and using the volcano to spew Orakelkem into

452
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:12,295
the atmosphere, Dr. Shin begs Aquaman and Orm
to rescue him from Manta just before Black

453
00:42:12,335 --> 00:42:18,140
Manta attacks them. During the battle, Orm takes
hold of Black Manta's trident, which gives

454
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:24,265
him visions of the past. After Atlantis comes
to the brothers' rescue and bombs the island,

455
00:42:24,385 --> 00:42:30,458
destroying the volcano, Orm reveals that the
trident is possessed by Kordax. the ancient

456
00:42:30,558 --> 00:42:36,681
Atlantean king of Necros, who used orichalcum
and black magic to pollute the earth and corrupt

457
00:42:36,741 --> 00:42:42,704
and mutate his people into monsters. Cordax
was defeated by his brother Atlin, the king

458
00:42:42,764 --> 00:42:49,148
of Atlantis, who used blood magic to seal his
brother and the kingdom of Necros in ice forever.

459
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:55,571
Black Manta, they learn, is being used by Cordax
to melt the ice caps and free the lost kingdom.

460
00:42:59,838 --> 00:43:05,042
into the villain Cordax, who they also made
Atlan's brother. I thought that was genius.

461
00:43:05,643 --> 00:43:11,388
I got to give a big shout out to listener Corey
Wooten, who years ago, when we learned that

462
00:43:11,428 --> 00:43:16,653
Pelo Aspect was going to be in the Aquaman sequel,
we asked listeners as a question of the week

463
00:43:16,773 --> 00:43:21,698
who they thought he was playing. And Corey Wooten,
if you listen to our Falcon and the Winter

464
00:43:21,738 --> 00:43:26,590
Soldier review episode, stated that he thought
he was playing Cordax. And he was right. Yeah

465
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:32,694
Cory bro, you gotta hook me up with the next
Powerball numbers. Please. Realizing Cordex

466
00:43:32,714 --> 00:43:38,458
can only be freed from the Blood Magic Ice Prison
with the blood of Atlantean royalty, Aquaman

467
00:43:38,498 --> 00:43:43,982
and his family rush to his father's lighthouse,
only to find his father Tom dying and Junior

468
00:43:44,042 --> 00:43:49,826
kidnapped. While Tom recovers, Arthur rallies
his kingdom to rescue his son, chasing Black

469
00:43:49,846 --> 00:43:55,409
Manta to Antarctica, where Cordex's forces have
been unleashed and do battle with the Atlanteans.

470
00:43:55,998 --> 00:44:01,362
Meanwhile, Dr. Shin hides Junior from Black
Manta, but both are caught. I thought the movie

471
00:44:01,402 --> 00:44:06,506
really wussed out by not killing Aquaman's dad.
I mean, they didn't kill Aqua Baby, and we

472
00:44:06,847 --> 00:44:10,470
probably figured that was gonna happen, but
if they weren't gonna kill Aqua Baby, they

473
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:14,874
should have at least killed Aqua Dad. They should
have, because there's precedent for that in

474
00:44:14,894 --> 00:44:20,218
the comic as well. Both Aquaman and Black Manta
essentially killed each other's fathers. So

475
00:44:20,719 --> 00:44:26,310
why the hell not kill Tom? They really wussed
out, I agree. Aquaman stops Black Manta before

476
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:31,512
Junior's blood can be spilled on the altar in
front of the frozen Cordax. The two battle,

477
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:36,735
and Arthur disarms Black Manta of the Trident,
only for Orm to get ahold of it and become

478
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:43,577
possessed by Cordax, successfully drawing Arthur's
blood on the altar. As Cordax becomes free,

479
00:44:43,757 --> 00:44:48,900
Arthur and Orm struggle for control of the Black
Trident, with their bond as brothers, helping

480
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:55,090
them overcome Cordax's influence, and Arthur
manages to kill Cordax, with Atlan's trident.

481
00:44:55,370 --> 00:45:01,674
It makes you wonder why if Orm had the trident,
why didn't he just prick his finger over the

482
00:45:01,734 --> 00:45:06,617
altar? He has royal blood too, he could have
easily undone the curse being possessed by

483
00:45:06,677 --> 00:45:10,639
Kordax. He didn't really need Arthur's blood.
Well I think Arthur would have tried to stop

484
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:16,502
him, so there was a tussle that was going to
result regardless. Fair enough. After Black

485
00:45:16,582 --> 00:45:24,154
Mantis seemingly falls to his death rather than
be saved by Arthur, join their allies on a

486
00:45:24,194 --> 00:45:29,656
glacier, where Arthur gives Orm his freedom
rather than imprisoning him once again. To

487
00:45:29,696 --> 00:45:35,399
help deal with the damaged atmosphere, Arthur
reveals the existence of Atlantis to the UN

488
00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:42,141
and the public. In the mid-credits scene, Orm
enjoys a cheeseburger and a cockroach. Which

489
00:45:42,201 --> 00:45:49,664
is a hell of a way to end the DCEU. I mean,
it was funny, I laughed, but also like I was

490
00:45:49,744 --> 00:45:53,994
kind of hoping there would be a little bit more
after the credits. Yeah, something more substantial.

491
00:45:54,514 --> 00:45:59,896
Right, right. Just to say like, hey, this is
all done, but get ready for something new.

492
00:46:00,036 --> 00:46:05,258
I don't know. Yeah, I think the Flash actually
did a better job at that. I believe initially

493
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:10,059
the Flash was supposed to come out after Aquaman,
according to the original release schedule.

494
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:15,941
And it's a shame that it didn't stay that way.
It's a huge shame. These release dates should

495
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:20,067
have been flipped, I feel. I actually think
they would have gotten more money out of both

496
00:46:20,107 --> 00:46:23,728
of them if that had been the case. Because it
really would have felt like The Flash was this

497
00:46:23,828 --> 00:46:29,091
event film that you had to see because it was
setting up something new. Yeah, instead we

498
00:46:29,131 --> 00:46:34,153
got a Flash movie that didn't really serve as
a transition and an Aquaman movie that was

499
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:39,395
kind of pointless. Exactly. It's hard for me
to say that things are pointless just because

500
00:46:39,475 --> 00:46:43,777
I think films should stand on their own regardless
of if they're part of a cinematic universe

501
00:46:43,797 --> 00:46:48,608
or not. but this film really doesn't do that
either in the sense that it has very little

502
00:46:48,648 --> 00:46:55,652
redeemable value on its own. I think despite
a worthwhile final act, the scenic CG-heavy

503
00:46:55,692 --> 00:47:02,315
film's attempts at silly humor and serious themes
make for a tonally inconsistent finale to the

504
00:47:02,355 --> 00:47:08,019
DCEU. And I think that's the film's biggest
sin is that it's tonally inconsistent. I think

505
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:14,390
a director's main job is tone, and James Wan
kind of failed on that here. I'm giving the

506
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:20,394
film 3 out of 5 stars, which is a 60% rating
so it's borderline between a fresh and rotten

507
00:47:20,434 --> 00:47:27,498
tomato. I've decided to not recommend this film,
so it is getting a rotten rating from me. I

508
00:47:27,518 --> 00:47:32,501
think it's right between Thor Love and Thunder
and Shazam Fury of the Gods, which at least

509
00:47:32,721 --> 00:47:38,185
was tonally consistent. I agree with the 3 star
rating. I could also understand why you would

510
00:47:38,265 --> 00:47:43,681
not recommend the film. largely due to its place
within the DCEU, where it came chronologically

511
00:47:43,741 --> 00:47:49,385
in that release order. We've seen a lot of superhero
films recently make the mistake of going too

512
00:47:49,425 --> 00:47:54,729
comedic with things, whether it's Thor 11th
Under or like Modok from the Ant-Man movie.

513
00:47:54,929 --> 00:48:00,353
I hope it's a trend that does not continue into
2024, because I think it results in a lapse

514
00:48:00,473 --> 00:48:06,017
of cinematic quality that exacerbates the current
issue that we're seeing of superhero fatigue.

515
00:48:06,434 --> 00:48:13,236
2023 is the year that fatigue really started
to set in. And I think films like Aquaman,

516
00:48:13,256 --> 00:48:17,798
The Lost Kingdom are partially to blame. This
movie is not helping the genre, and both Marvel

517
00:48:17,858 --> 00:48:22,520
and DC need to do a course correction for the
future. Absolutely. Yeah, I agree. And luckily,

518
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:27,882
we know that DC is next year. We're going to
be getting Joker, Folly, I do. But I think

519
00:48:27,902 --> 00:48:34,025
that's the only live action DC film we're getting.
So, yeah, we won't be seeing too much DC within

520
00:48:34,065 --> 00:48:41,159
the next 365 days. Good, finally, geez. Fuck
you. I wish we were seeing less Marvel. I freaking

521
00:48:41,299 --> 00:48:46,100
hate watching these movies now. But that does
it for this review guys. Let us know what you
