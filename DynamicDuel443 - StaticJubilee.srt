00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,640
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi and welcome
to the Dynamic Dual Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,920
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,920
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe and I'm his twin

4
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:42,920
brother Johnny DC. And in this episode we're going
to find out who'd win in a fight between Jubilee of

5
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:49,300
the X-Men and Static of the Milestone Comic
Imprint from DC. Right, both of these characters

6
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:57,220
had hit shows in the late 90s and early 2000s. They
both wear jackets, they both sport eye gear, they

7
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,900
both shoot sparkly things from their fingers.
Well, I mean Static does a lot more than that, which

8
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:07,580
is probably why he's going to win. Now Jubilee
shoots fireworks, okay? And no little sparkly

9
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,020
little lightning things are going to compete with
the power of fireworks as everyone should know

10
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:18,120
this 4th of July season. Like you go outside during
the 4th of July and you hear all those explosions?

11
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,240
Yeah, it's because they're fucking explosions,
they're loud, they rattle your windows, it's

12
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,540
really annoying. If you're a grown ass adult like
me, your dog probably gets pissed off. But yeah,

13
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,580
it's potent stuff. Oh yeah, it's almost like, you
know, when lightning strikes and there's

14
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:37,380
thunder? No, that doesn't happen. Okay, well this
is going to be an interesting matchup I think.

15
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,280
We'll find out who's going to win later on in this
episode. But before that we're going to break down

16
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,100
the latest comic book movie news to come out this
past week, of which we just have one news item and

quick to the no prize. A no prize is an award that

36
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,980
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version, the
dynamic duel no prize, is a digital award that we

37
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:57,380
post on Instagram for the person that we feel gave
the best answer to our question of the week. Last

38
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:02,600
week we asked you guys, besides the Punisher and
obviously Daredevil, which of the former Marvel

39
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:06,980
Netflix characters would you most want to see in
the next Spider-Man film? And this is coming off

40
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,360
the news that it has been confirmed that the
Punisher is going to be in the next Spider-Man

41
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:17,040
brand new day movie. We got five answers total, so
let's go down our three honorable mentions and the

42
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,540
no prize winner. Our first honorable mention goes
to Alex Albro, who said, I think Nuke should be the

43
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,840
one from the Netflix universe to be in the
Spider-Man movie. He's a really grounded

44
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,300
character who could be an Act One villain, or he
could be on the Punisher side and they're going

45
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,720
crazy throughout New York, and then either the
Punisher kind of sees the evil of his ways and stops

46
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,380
Nuke, or Spider-Man stops them before they all go
crazy, or maybe Spider-Man just gets a symbiote

47
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:47,320
and everybody's crazy in a really allegedly
grounded movie. Thanks. Yeah, I thought this was a

48
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:52,580
pretty good answer because Nuke was in the first
two seasons of Jessica Jones. I guess the one issue

49
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:58,660
with this answer is that Nuke died in Jessica
Jones, but he was played by Will Travel and I

50
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,100
thought he was actually really good in the role.
Kind of a bizarro take on Captain America in a

51
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:08,260
different way that John Walker was. For those who
may not know who Nuke is, he's like a super soldier,

52
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:13,060
but he takes these pills to get his physical
enhancements. He played a big part of the born

53
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,520
again Daredevil comic book storyline, but I can
see how elements of that could be incorporated

54
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,320
into the Spider-Man movie. Yeah, great answer,
Alex. Our next honorable mention goes to Lorenzo

55
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:29,460
Valdez. Who said? This is Lorenzo Valdez calling
in once again. The Netflix character that I think

56
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,980
is perhaps most likely to appear in Spider-Man
Brand New Day would be Karen, given that we already

57
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:41,100
know that the Punisher is now going to be in the
movie. But I also will say that I think we would

58
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:47,520
really be missing out if we never got to see a
confrontation between Kingpin and Spider-Man in

59
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,100
the MCU. Clona forever and always, buh-bye. Yeah,
Karen Page has been a big part of the storylines for

60
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,720
both Daredevil and Punisher. So if Punisher is
making an appearance in the Spider-Man movie, it

61
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,960
would not surprise me if Karen was also there.
Yeah, she's kind of the supporting character that

62
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,660
bridges a lot of the gaps between the Daredevil and
Punisher series. And I think she's Frank

63
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,640
Strongest supporting, consistent supporting
character throughout all of his appearances. So

64
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,000
great answer, Lorenzo. Our next honorable
mention goes to Cyrus Moore. Who said? Hey guys,

65
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,120
Cyrus Moore. So what I really want to see is I don't
want to see the Punisher Daredevil in this new

66
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,680
Spider-Man movie. I want to see Iron Fist because
with Iron Fist, we could bring over Luke Cage in the

67
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:36,620
same movie, maybe introduce Nova, recast Flash
Thompson that way we can get an agent Venom, have

68
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:41,200
White Tiger that way we can have an ultimate
Spider-Man movie, and introduce a bunch of

69
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,940
characters and have an amazing team up. And that
would just be awesome. Yeah, this is kind of going

70
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:52,320
along the lines of why we asked this question of the
week to begin with, because incorporating the

71
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:56,900
Punisher into the Spider-Man series kind of makes
it seem like the story is going to take a more

72
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:02,320
grounded street level approach, and that would be
a good opportunity to bring in other defenders

73
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:07,740
characters from the Netflix series. And yeah, I
think Iron Fist is a strong candidate, especially

74
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:13,440
if they give the guy some good fight choreography
this time, and he follows through with it, I think

75
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,360
Danny Rand would be a good addition, and then also
bring in Luke Cage and other characters like Agent

76
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,840
Venom. Although Cyrus mentioned recasting Flash
Thompson for the role of Agent Venom, and I think

77
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,620
Tony Revelore could pull it off. Yeah, he's kind of
on the smaller end, but that doesn't really bother

78
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:34,960
me because he's a good actor. Tom Hardy himself is a
little bit on the smaller end, you know? He's only

79
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,380
like three inches taller than Tony Revelore, so.
Oh, I did not know that. Well, great answer, Cyrus.

80
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,960
We want to give a quick shout out to Sheldon Moore
for taking the time to visit our website and record

81
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:53,300
an answer. But the winner of this week's No Prize is
Lee Tapscott, who said, Which character from the

82
00:07:53,300 --> 00:08:00,620
Netflix Marvel series I would like to see in
Spider-Man movie? The character of Kingpin. I

83
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:09,580
mean, he was originally a Spider-Man enemy, and
with him being like the mayor of New York right now,

84
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:17,660
he could be going after Spider-Man for, you know,
being an unregistered superhero or whatever he's

85
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:23,600
after. Yeah, I guess this all really depends on how
Daredevil born again season two kind of shapes up

86
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:29,120
with Daredevil's battle going up against Mayor
Kingpin. But yeah, I think it would be fantastic to

87
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,539
have Vincent D'Narvio as the Kingpin be the
primary antagonist for the Spider-Man brand new

88
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:39,419
day film, especially if you have like the Punisher
and maybe even Daredevil show up and they all team

89
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:44,680
up to go up against him. Oh yeah, totally. When we
asked this question, I really wasn't looking for

90
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:51,400
the Defenders characters. I was looking for
Kingpin. And since Lee Tapscott gave only that

91
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:56,140
answer and no one else, that's why he gets this
week's No Prize win. Yeah, I think it would just

92
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:00,540
feel right considering he's right in that the
Kingpin was originally a Spider-Man villain

93
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,240
before he was a Daredevil villain. And you know,
with the Punisher making his first appearance in

94
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,980
the Spider-Man comic books too, everything just
seems to dovetail nicely in regards to a

95
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,860
Spider-Man street level crime story. So great
answer, Lee. You win this week's No Prize. If you,

96
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:19,360
the listener, want a shot at winning your own No
Prize, stay tuned to later on in this episode when

97
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:30,040
we'll be asking another question of the week.
Another That's Done. On to the news! Alright, this

98
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,340
past week we got the final trailer for the
Fantastic Four First Steps film, which comes out

99
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:41,860
in just a few weeks here on July 25th. It's our final
good look at the movie before it comes out, and I

100
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:47,500
gotta say it's the best trailer that's come out
yet. I think it has a lot of scenes and moments that I

101
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:51,620
think will get a lot of people excited, what they
were probably looking for in the trailer since the

102
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:56,660
beginning. Because we get a good introduction and
good look at the heroes and the costumes. We get to

103
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:02,700
see a lot of action of them going up against
Galactus. We get to see everybody's powers

104
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:08,740
including Reed stretching and Sue creating
current visible force fields. The thing smashing

105
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:13,700
through stuff and the human torch flying, the
Fantastic Car flying. I'm not surprised that they

106
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:19,700
waited until the final trailer to really showcase
the special effects considering the film is very

107
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:25,100
CG heavy. I gotta say the special effects look
amazing in this film. I love the feel and visual

108
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:30,460
tone of the movie. Galactus looks like he's gonna
be freaking awesome. The more I see this

109
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:34,920
character, because in the previous trailer we
just got a shot of his legs as he was walking through

110
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,540
the city. And in the trailer before that we just got
a shot of his shadow looking over Manhattan. But

111
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,300
here, while we don't get to see his face, we get to
see pretty much the rest of his body. And I think

112
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,180
it's gonna look incredible on the big screen with
all the intricate details that they actually have

113
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:54,220
on his suit. The scale of him is gonna be pretty awe
inspiring when we finally get to see him. We got

114
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:59,940
another look at Shalabal's Silver Surfer played
by Julia Garner who has a little bit more dialogue

115
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,380
in this trailer as she heralds the coming of
Galactus. I thought her voice treatment was

116
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:09,060
pretty good. Again, still not thrilled about this
not being Gnor and Rad, but we've talked about that

117
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:15,100
on this podcast before. Actually didn't love her
delivery. Now Julia Garner is a good actress, so I

118
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:22,200
was kind of surprised. It sounded like to me she was
asking questions. I herald your end maybe? That

119
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,500
wasn't a question mark, it was a comma. The whole
thing was question marks. She's an alien, maybe

120
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,260
that's their style of diction. You don't know. Do
you speak alien? Are you from another planet?

121
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:38,540
Sounds like fucking English to me. It's English,
but it's alien English, okay? Okay. It's totally

122
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:43,520
fine. It looks like at some point in the movie the
Fantastic Four fly up to Galactus' spaceship,

123
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:47,780
which I think is gonna be a cool scene. And that's
where they, like, I don't know, they almost die in

124
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:52,320
the process coming back down to Earth. There's a
really nice acting moment with Petro Pascal when

125
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,460
reporters ask him if everything's gonna be okay
and he gives the honest answer of I don't know,

126
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:02,340
which is a big deal for Reed Richards considering
he's regarded as the smartest man in the world and

127
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:09,240
he should have the answers. We get a few shots of
baby Franklin Richards and his appearance makes

128
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,100
me think that maybe he's gonna be used as a McGuffin
of sorts. I hope they don't do some kind of deus ex

129
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,620
machina where the baby ends up saving the day
because he's, you know, he's an all powerful

130
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:23,320
reality warper in the comic books. Yeah, it was
interesting to see him as a baby. I don't think I've

131
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,560
ever really seen him as an infant in the comics.
Usually he's a little boy, right? Right. So I

132
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,680
thought it was interesting that in the previous
trailer we have Sue and Reed finding out that

133
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,700
they're pregnant. But then in this trailer, like,
the baby is already here. So it makes me wonder

134
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:42,920
about, like, how long of a timeframe this film
takes place in. Yeah, definitely over the course

135
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:49,080
of a year, right? Considering the kid looks about,
like, eight to ten months old within these shots.

136
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:53,060
Maybe the Silver Surfer comes and warns
everybody, tells them they have, like, a year

137
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:58,280
before Galactus comes or something like that. Who
knows. Interesting. There's a running gag

138
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,980
throughout the trailer where people are trying to
get Ben Grimm the thing to say it's clobbering

139
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:08,440
time, which is his catchphrase in the in-universe
cartoon that they have about the Fantastic Four.

140
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,700
And it's pretty funny. Johnny tries multiple
times to try to get him to say it, including an

141
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:18,480
interesting scene where he's, like, carrying the
thing while flying. But the thing has a beard. He

142
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:24,880
has a full-on mustache and beard combo made out of
rock that I've never seen anything like that

143
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,520
before in the comic books. I've seen the Hulk with a
beard, but I don't think I've ever seen the thing

144
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,100
with a beard. I didn't even think that he could grow
a beard. And I feel like it raises all sorts of

145
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:41,100
questions regarding Ben Grimm's body hair. Like,
does he have pubes? Or armpit hair? Like, does it

146
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,860
crystallize out of his armpits? And he has to,
like, shave all this stuff? It's really bizarre. I

147
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:51,120
don't like it. I don't like things with a beard. I
hope he loses it. I hope he doesn't have it for, you

148
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,480
know, the climax of the film. And it's like, why
doesn't he have hair on top of his head? Yeah,

149
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,340
that's a great question. Great question. Does he
not shave his eyebrows? And so, like, is that why

150
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:08,460
they're so bulky and big? Oh, that's interesting.
Are the beetle brows hair, rock hair? Wow. I think

151
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:13,100
it's just a kind of an uncomfortable subject. And I
don't want to think about Ben Grimm's pubes. So I'd

152
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:20,280
rather just stop discussing it. Yeah, and he's
like ass hair. I don't want to think about that. All

153
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:25,940
in all, I was really pleased by this trailer and I am
really hoping that it provides the level of

154
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:30,640
excitement that the film needs in order to do well
at the box office. Again, it's only coming out two

155
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,400
weeks after the Superman film. Hopefully
Fantastic Four just bites a huge chunk out of the

156
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:41,860
Superman final box office. That way I can gloat in
front of Jonathan. But speaking of the DC Marvel

157
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:51,080
summer blockwesters that come out in July, that
brings us to our question of the week. What movie do

158
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:58,300
you think will be making more at the worldwide box
office? Superman or the Fantastic Four first

159
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:05,440
steps and why? And this includes the entire
duration of their theatrical runs worldwide. By

160
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,820
the end, what's your best guess as to who's coming
out on top and will ultimately be the more popular

161
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:16,260
film? Yes, and why is it Superman? Record your

166
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,660
the news for this episode, so let's go ahead and
move into our main event where we find out who would

167
00:15:47,660 --> 00:16:09,600
win in a fight between the teen heroes of Static and
Jubilee. Static vs Jubilee Static vs Jubilee,

168
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,360
this particular matchup was an idea by the
executive producers. We've been trying to get

169
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,860
Static in a duel matchup forever, basically,
since the start of this podcast. So I'm surprised

170
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,760
that we're just getting to him now because we
really enjoyed his cartoon Static Shock on the WB

171
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:32,000
as kids. And we also loved the 90s X-Men cartoon of
which Jubilee played a major role, especially

172
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,320
within, you know, that first season. Right,
exactly. We have these two young teen heroes who

173
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,600
are encountering new worlds filled with
superpowers for the first time from their

174
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,140
respective cartoons that were popular when we
were kids. We watched the heck out of those shows,

175
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:52,660
but we're really doing this episode now in lead up
to the 4th of July holiday since Jubilee has

176
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:57,940
fireworks powers, essentially. We thought this
would be a fun episode to do. Yeah, so when you go out

177
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:03,060
there and see all of the fireworks displays this
holiday, you can just think about, dang, like

178
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,319
Jubilee really shoots those out of her
fingertips. She really did fuck Static up that

179
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,300
episode. Yeah, or maybe during your 4th of July
weekend there happens to be a thunderstorm and

180
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,760
you're seeing all of the crazy lightning and
thunder and you're like, whoa, that's way more

181
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:21,599
scary than fireworks. I'm so glad Static won
because he should have. We will see what happens.

182
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:25,440
But to explain the methodology behind our duels,
let's go to our sentient duel simulator Alfred

183
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:31,420
Jarvis-9000. AJ9K tell our listeners how you go
about determining a winner in our duel matchups.

184
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:36,660
Yes, of course, sir. The way I determine a winner
between the contestants is by running 1000 Monte

185
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:41,520
Carlo simulations using the characters
statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation is a

186
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:46,440
probabilistic model used to determine outcomes
through random sampling. In this case, I

187
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,620
randomize the statistics along a normal
distribution as a way to simulate the many

188
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:55,540
variables that can occur during battle. The stat
parameters are based on the official Marvel power

189
00:17:55,540 --> 00:18:00,840
grid from which the DC characters statistics are
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are

190
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,340
included such as range, damage potential,
versatility and perception in order to create a

191
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:11,340
more detailed and accurate simulation. The
results of the 1000 simulations provide a

192
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:15,280
percentage of wins for each character. The
contestant with the higher percentage is

193
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,100
declared the victor as they have a higher
probability to win any given battle. In an

194
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:25,520
equitable pairing, neither character should win
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have

195
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,400
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat
Superman, so the confidence rate of my method

196
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,440
falls in line with the precedents that have been
established in the source material. My

197
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,920
mathematical simulations are without
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole

198
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:45,500
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K.

199
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,240
Before we run the simulations though, we like to
break down each character's histories and

200
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:55,180
abilities before improvising a scenario on how we
imagine one of the 1000 simulations would play out

201
00:18:55,180 --> 00:19:01,640
beat for beat. And it is my turn to go first with the
DC characters backstory, so let me tell you all

202
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:09,680
about static. Now within the Dakotaverse, also
known as Earth M, Virgil Ovid Hawkins grew up in

203
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:16,520
Dakota City, a fictional Midwestern city plagued
by crime, poverty and social tension. Virgil was a

204
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,560
bright, science-loving teenager who adored
comic books, video games, and all things pop

205
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:27,020
culture. His intelligence and interests often
made him a target for bullies at Ernest Hemingway

206
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:33,640
High School, especially Martin Bizmoney B
Skoponi. Despite the harassment, Virgil

207
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:40,100
maintained strong friendships with classmates
like Frida Gorin and Larry Wade. Quietly, he

208
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:46,360
harbored feelings for Frida, not realizing she
was dating Larry. One night, after enduring yet

209
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,660
another beating at the hands of Martin and his
friends, Virgil reached his breaking point.

210
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:57,860
Pressured by Larry, he went to Paris Island with a
gun, intent on confronting his tormentor. In the

211
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:02,960
end, he could not bring himself to commit an act of
violence, and he tossed the weapon into a river,

212
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,200
choosing to walk away instead. At that moment,
however, the police arrived to break up a massive

213
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:14,300
gang brawl nearby, which would later be known as
the Big Bang. The police unleashed experimental

214
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:21,200
tear gas infused with a mutagenic agent known as
quantum juice. The gas was originally designed as

215
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:27,260
a radioactive tracing agent to track criminals,
but instead caused horrifying mutations,

216
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:32,980
transferring many who survived into
superpowered beings known as Bang Babies. Virgil

217
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:38,700
survived the event and discovered he had
developed electromagnetic powers. Inspired by

218
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,360
his love of superheroes and driven by a sense of
justice, he crafted a homemade costume and

219
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,800
adopted the name Static, determined to protect
his city. As Static, Virgil quickly realized that

220
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:54,740
being a hero was far more challenging than he had
ever imagined. His first major battle was against

221
00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:01,060
Hotstrike, the pyrokinetic form of his former
bully, Martin Scarponi. Initially overpowered,

222
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:06,280
Static rallied to defend Frida, who discovered
his identity and became his closest confidant.

223
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:12,500
She supported his mission, but also reminded him
of the importance of balance, as his dual life

224
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:18,580
strained his friendships, academics, and family
responsibilities. Virgil struggled to keep jobs

225
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:24,640
and saw his great slip, discovering that heroism
demanded countless personal sacrifices. Over

226
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,340
time, his enemies grew more dangerous. Static
fought criminals like Commando X, who sought to

227
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:35,380
divide the city through fearing chaos and
holocaust, a ruthless energy-wielding villain

228
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:40,100
and former member of the Blood Syndicate, which
was a powerful gang of metihumans trying to impose

229
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:45,360
their own control on Dakota City. He faced
unpredictable metihumans like Tarmac, Rubber

230
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,320
Bandman, and Puff, and even reality-bending
threats such as Riff. Despite these challenges,

231
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:56,460
Virgil continued to push forward, using his
intelligence and scientific mind to outwit foes

232
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:01,640
as much as overpowered them. His analytical
nature allowed him to develop creative tactics,

233
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:06,400
including using electromagnetic fields to
deflect bullets and mobilize enemies and hack

234
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,480
into communication systems. He built his iconic
flying disc, known as the Static Saucer, which

235
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,200
allowed him to soar through the city and pursue
criminals with speed and precision. Virgil's

236
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,820
personal life, however, became increasingly
complicated. His brief romance with the

237
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:27,380
mysterious metihuman Dusk offered him hope and
escape, but it ended in tragedy when she

238
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:32,700
sacrificed herself to save civilians from a fire.
This loss, combined with the death of his close

239
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:38,300
friend Larry during a failed drug operation,
pushed Virgil to the brink of giving up his heroic

240
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:43,980
identity altogether. Grieving and questioning
whether his actions truly made a difference, he

241
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:49,500
stepped away from the mantle of Static to try and
reclaim a normal life. Dakota, however, could not

242
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:54,440
be left unprotected. When bank babies began
mysteriously disappearing, Virgil discovered

243
00:22:54,440 --> 00:23:00,580
the culprit was John Tower, a once heroic figure
turned power-hungry villain. Timmy Gupp with

244
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:06,240
other heroes, Virgil led a mission to confront
Tower, free the captives, and restore hope to his

245
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:12,040
city. Through this ordeal, he reaffirmed his
commitment to heroism, but vowed to approach it

246
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:17,840
with more balance, choosing to protect Dakota on
his own terms rather than being consumed by guilt

247
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:24,140
or duty. Following the merging of the Dakotaverse
and the main DC universe, Static joined the Teen

248
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:29,320
Titans. Initially haunted by trauma from his time
as a captive fighter in the Dark Side Club's

249
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:34,700
underground tournaments, he struggled to fit in.
However, he eventually found camaraderie and

250
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:40,440
purpose with his new teammates forming bonds with
Acogirl, Blue Beetle, and Wondergirl. His

251
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,780
brilliance as a scientist and inventor shone
through when he designed a special stabilizing

252
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:50,200
suit for Kid Flash, saving him from a potentially
fatal molecular breakdown. You, of course, can

253
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:55,380
learn more about the Teen Titans in our Titans vs
X-Men dual episode. His time with the Titans

254
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:00,380
provided Virgil with something he had long
craved, a surrogate family who understood his

255
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:06,060
struggles and stood by him. He proved himself as
both a capable fighter and a supportive friend

256
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:11,480
earning the respect and affection of the team.
Eventually, Virgil returned to Dakota after

257
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,620
hearing that a deadly virus was sweeping through
the city, infecting many residents including his

258
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:22,180
sister Sharon. Investigating its origin, he
confronted Holocaust, who had orchestrated the

259
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:27,620
plague as part of a power scheme. In the ensuing
conflict, Static was captured and imprisoned in a

260
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:32,640
containment unit designed to neutralize his
abilities. Ultimately, the Teen Titans arrived

261
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:38,010
to rescue him and together they defeated
Holocaust. After reuniting with his family in

262
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:43,350
Frida, Virgil decided to return to San Francisco
with the Titans, telling his parents he had been

263
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:48,710
accepted into a quantum physics fellowship to
protect his secret life. Although his ties to home

264
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:53,710
remained strained, he carried with him a renewed
sense of resolve and community. In the

265
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:59,110
post-Flashpoint timeline, Virgil and his family
moved to New York City following a traumatic event

266
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:04,450
that left his sister Sharon split into two
identical versions of herself. Virgil began

267
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:09,730
working as an intern at Star Labs under the
guidance of Hardware, a brilliant technological

268
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:15,610
hero. There he received advanced equipment,
including a new high-tech suit and an upgraded

269
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:21,730
versatile flying disc. In New York, Virgil faced
new adversaries, including the powerful

270
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:27,470
sunspots and viral, a living virus entity.
Despite these challenges, he continued to

271
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:32,690
support his fellow heroes, even helping Red Robin
redesign his cape and glider apparatus,

272
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:38,630
showcasing his technical genius. When the Dakota
verse was later rebooted, Virgil's origin was

273
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:44,090
revised so that he gained his powers during a
violent clash at a Black Lives Matter protest,

274
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:49,110
confronting Cotstreek shortly after. Once he
stepped into the hero role, he exposed government

275
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:54,250
corruption and rescued kidnapped bang babies,
solidifying his reputation as Dakota's

276
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:59,810
guardian. And that's Static's backstory.
Power-wise, Static can generate, absorb, and

277
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:05,510
manipulate electromagnetic energy, enabling
him to produce powerful electrical attacks,

278
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:11,210
magnetize objects, and create static cling
fields to immobilize opponents or anchor

279
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:17,050
objects. You can generate electromagnetic force
fields, which act as protective barriers against

280
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:23,530
projectiles and energy blasts. Using magnetic
levitation, he flies on a metal disc, the Static

281
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:30,170
saucer, which also doubles as a weapon and shield
in combat. His scientific intellect rivals some

282
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:36,810
of the DC Universe's greatest minds, allowing him
to build custom gear and analyze complex threats.

283
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:42,230
His powers, however, are ineffective against
insulators such as wood and rubber, and that

284
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:47,430
remains among his few physical limitations. I
didn't know that the Milestone Universe got

285
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:54,730
rebooted. Yeah, it did. I think around the rebirth
era, they took a new crack at the Dakota verse. That

286
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:59,890
was pretty interesting how they decided to
contemporize it by making it part of tear gas used

287
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:04,830
during a protest or something like that. That's
definitely a more interesting way to modernize

288
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:10,290
origin from the original gang violence kind of
angle that they went with during the character's

289
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:15,170
conception. Yeah, I think the creators of
Milestone Comics always want their characters to

290
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:21,270
remain relevant in a modern day setting and
context. So what they did, I thought, was an

291
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:26,510
interesting approach. For sure. Yeah. Also, I
forgot that Esthetic is pretty smart, too. He's

292
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:32,210
like a smart kid, inventor kid. Yeah, really
smart. That may come to hurt Jubilee because she's

293
00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:37,850
notoriously not good at math. She has something
called discalculia, I think, which is not like a

294
00:27:37,850 --> 00:27:42,310
measure of intelligence or anything like that,
but it just means that she has difficulty

295
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:47,610
processing numbers in her head, kind of similar to
like how a dyslexic has trouble reading.

296
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:52,750
Interesting. OK. But who cares? Because math's
not going to probably show up in this speculation

297
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:59,930
at all. Let me go ahead and tell you more about
Jubilee. Jubilee Lee was born in Beverly Hills,

298
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:04,970
California, to two Chinese American doctors who
had built a comfortable life after immigrating

299
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:10,190
from Hong Kong. She loved arcade games and
excelled at gymnastics with coaches whispering

300
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:15,530
about the Olympics. Her world ended, however,
when hired gunmen murdered her parents outside

301
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:21,550
their home. Orphaned at 13, Jubilee ran from
foster care and turned the giant Hollywood mall

302
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:26,550
into a secret hideout. She stole food and earned
spare change by shooting bright, sparkling

303
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:32,830
fireworks from her hands, her newly awakened
mutant power. Mall managers hired the M Squad, a

304
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:37,950
group of paid to capture mutants. During a chase
through the food court, Jubilee's panic set off a

305
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:44,450
blinding blast. At the same moment for X-Men,
Storm, Rogue, Silak and Dazzler happened to be

306
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:50,530
shopping. They drove the hunters off and Jubilee
saw that they were heroes. Their ally, Gateway, a

307
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:55,550
silent teleporter, opened a portal for the team.
Before it closed, Jubilee secretly slipped

308
00:28:55,550 --> 00:29:00,350
through and found herself at the X-Men's
temporary base in the Australian desert. You can

309
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:04,950
learn more about the X-Men and their duel against
the Titans. Unsure the famous mutants would trust

310
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:10,110
a runaway. She hid in tunnels for weeks, sewing
together a bright yellow jacket from Dazzler's

311
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:15,650
spare clothes. Trouble hit when the Reavers,
brutal cyborg outlaws, stormed the base and

312
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:21,630
nailed Wolverine to a metal X. Jubilee refused to
leave him. She freed him and stayed by his side,

313
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:26,530
scavenging water and supplies while his healing
factor did the rest, a rescue that forged the

314
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:31,810
father and daughter bond that would shape her
life. The Reavers kept hunting so the pair fled to

315
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:37,190
Madropore, a crime-ridden island in Southeast
Asia. There they battled the Mandarin, who ruled

316
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:42,470
local gangs with help from the hand, a deadly ninja
clan. Jubilee's fireworks blew a hole in the

317
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:47,470
Mandarin's fortress and helped free Sylocke from
brainwashing. You can learn more about Wolverine

318
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:53,130
in his duel against Hawkman and more about Sylocke
in her duel against Gorilla Grodd. News of mutant

319
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:58,930
slavery pulled the trio to Genosha, an island
nation that forced mutants into hard labor.

320
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:03,390
Jubilee guided depowered mutants boom-boom and
rictured through patrols until other X-teams

321
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:08,750
toppled the government. Professor Charles
Xavier, impressed by her courage, invited her to a

322
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:14,210
school in West Chester, New York. Joining
Cyclops, Beast and Rogue on the X-Men Blue team,

323
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:18,710
Jubilee helped them fight villains such as
Sauron, the Sentinels, and the Brood. She even

324
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:23,890
escaped Mojo, a tyrant from another dimension who
showed her an enslaved future version of herself

325
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:30,170
named Epsissa, a future she swore to avoid. A time
portal later let Jubilee witness the night her

326
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:36,310
parents died. Armed with the killer's faces, she
tracked them but chose jail over revenge after

327
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:41,310
Wolverine's advice. Her grief continued though
when her young friend Magic died of the legacy

328
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:46,930
virus, Magneto ripped metal from Wolverine's
bones, and Sabertooth broke free inside the

329
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:52,530
mansion. Shaking off the terror, Jubilee fired a
neutralizer gun and knocked Sabertooth out when

330
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:57,170
the mansion's defenses failed. You can learn more
about Sabertooth in his duel against Killer Croc.

331
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:02,850
Not long after, Techno Organic Aliens called the
Phalanx captured many senior X-Men. Jubilee

332
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:07,730
teamed with Banshee, Emma Frost, and even
Sabertooth to rescue the captives and several

333
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:13,750
young mutants. Realizing she needed peers her own
age, she moved to the Massachusetts Academy to

334
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:20,570
help form a new school and team called Generation X
under the teachers Banshee and Emma Frost. Her

335
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:27,210
classmates were Husk, Sink, Monet, Chamber, and
Skin, and their school days mixed Algebra with

336
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:32,030
combat drills. They fought foes such as
Juggernaut, Omega Red, and Implate, her

337
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:36,750
classmate Monet's vampiric brother. During the
nationwide Operation Zero Tolerance

338
00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:42,610
Initiative, government agents kidnapped
Jubilee to steal X-Men's secrets. She blasted the

339
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:47,870
guards while escaping, stopped to give one guard
CPR, was recaptured, and then was freed by a

340
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:52,770
sympathetic aide. Wolverine brought her home,
but soon after, hacked security codes to let the

341
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:57,610
enemy raid the X-Mansion. Soon after, she learned
that a businessman named Hunter Braun had

342
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:02,010
arranged for her parents' death. Jubilee and her
friends tracked him down and she destroyed his

343
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:07,010
warehouse before police arrested him, finally
giving her closure. Generation X broke apart

344
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:12,830
after teammate Sink died diffusing a bomb and the
school closed. Jubilee and Skin tried acting in

345
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:18,930
Los Angeles, but found only stereotypical roles.
Her former teacher Banshee then formed X-Cor, a

346
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:24,190
mutant police force unit which Jubilee, Husk, and
Monet joined. They stopped riots in Paris,

347
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:29,150
blinded the giant blob, and stopped a plot by
mystique before the group fell apart. Hate

348
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:33,870
preachers called the Church of Humanity soon
kidnapped Jubilee, Skin, and others and

349
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:40,050
crucified them on the X-Men lawn. Angel's healing
blood saved her, but Skin died, deepening her

350
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:45,510
grief. She moved in with her long-glossed witch
aunt named Hope in Los Angeles, only to learn that

351
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:51,210
Hope was a secret assassin. A clash with her former
boss leveled the house and Jubilee returned to the

352
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:56,690
X-Men. Later, the Scarlet Witch warped reality in
an act that erased most of mutant kinds powers,

353
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:02,010
including Jubilee's. She opened a halfway house
in Queens for depowered mutants, but was badly

354
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:07,370
hurt when Omega Red attacked it. After healing,
she joined Night Thrasher's tech-based new

355
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:12,470
warriors. Wearing anti-gravity gauntlets, she
took the name Wundra and helped train her fellow

356
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:17,790
teammates. Trust broke, though, when Night
Thrasher hid a risky time machine plan. After

357
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:22,650
casualties and chaos, the new warriors
disbanded. You can learn more about that team in

358
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:27,550
their duel against Infinity Inc. While leading
friends in San Francisco, Jubilee was turned into

359
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:33,010
a vampire by Zaris, the son of Dracula, whom you can
learn more about in his duel against Andrew

360
00:33:33,010 --> 00:33:38,870
Bennett. Wolverine rescued her and the X-Men
toppled Zaris, but Jubilee remained undead. She

361
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:44,050
relied on Wolverine's blood and a mystic pendant
to endure weak sunlight. She trained with a group

362
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:48,810
of Daywalker vampires who taught her how to
control her vampiric impulses. Teaming with

363
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:53,950
Wolverine's clone, a former brainwashed killer
called X-23, helped both women manage their

364
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:59,870
darker urges. You can learn more about X-23 in her
duel against Cassandra Cain Bagrell. On a later

365
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:05,590
trip to Budapest, Jubilee found an abandoned baby
boy. She named him Shogo and took him to the rebuilt

366
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:10,750
Jean Grey School for higher learning. Storm
helped Jubilee complete the adoption process.

367
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:15,750
Headmistress Kitty Pryde, seeing Jubilee's
growth, asked her to mentor a class of misfit

368
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:22,170
students, Quentin Choir, Bling, Eyeboy, Nature
Girl, Morph, and Tynesite. Her old friend

369
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:27,750
Chambered co-taught alongside her and their
friendship became romance. Trouble struck when

370
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:33,170
Monet, merged with her vampire brother and plate,
invaded the school and stole Jubilee's sunlight

371
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:39,130
pendant. Quentin sacrificed a shard that he had of
the powerful Phoenix Force to save his teacher,

372
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:44,090
curing Jubilee's vampirism and restoring her
mutant abilities. Professor Xavier then

373
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:49,650
announced Cracoa, a living island where mutants
could live free. Jubilee and Shogo moved there and

374
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:55,449
joined Betsy Braddock, Rogue, Gambit, Richter,
and even Apocalypse on a new team called

375
00:34:55,449 --> 00:35:00,870
Excalibur. While exploring other worlds, a magic
realm linked by a portal, fairy energy

376
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:05,890
temporarily turned Shogo into a dragon. When he
was hurt by enemy soldiers, Jubilee's fireworks

377
00:35:05,890 --> 00:35:11,130
scattered the attackers and she calmed her son as
he healed. You can learn more about other worlds

378
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:16,870
and the Excalibur team in our Uncle Sam vs. Captain
Britain dual episode. The mutants of Cracoa later

379
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:22,470
held their first Hellfire Gala, a grand party
meant to show mutant progress. The anti-mutant

380
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:28,590
group Orcus and the war robot Nimrod attacked them
and Jubilee was killed in the fight. However,

381
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:34,570
within days she was restored to life on Cracoa via a
combination of other mutants' powers. And that's

382
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:39,850
Jubilee's history. Powers-wise, Jubilee is a
mutant with the ability to produce explosive

383
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:45,790
light blasts in the form of multi-colored energy
plasmoids that she refers to and highly resemble

384
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:51,230
fireworks. She can control their intensity in
terms of brightness and explosive potential,

385
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:55,630
meaning she can generate the energy bright enough
to blind opponents, which is why she wears big

386
00:35:55,630 --> 00:36:01,430
sunglasses, or powerful enough to blast your face
off at close proximity, just like a firework. And

387
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:06,110
that's a reminder to be safe out there this year,
kids. Taken to her utmost limit, Jubilee can

388
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:11,790
manifest a light blast so powerful that it turns
her whole body sparkly and can obliterate a

389
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:17,530
starship. In addition, for some reason, she has
natural psionic shields that make her slippery to

390
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:22,210
telepathic detection, possibly developed as a
safeguard from her powers manifesting as a

391
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:26,350
runaway, but I'm not sure what that has to do with
energy plasmoids. Maybe she has like little

392
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:30,310
plasmoids running around her brain, distorting
the electrical fields that make her difficult to

393
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:36,010
detect. But yeah, telepaths have trouble finding
her. Finally, Jubilee is an Olympic-level

394
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:41,590
gymnast and is an adept hand combatant, having
undergone some fight training with Wolverine.

395
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:46,410
That's really interesting because Static
actually has telepathic resistance as well, and I

396
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:51,910
have no idea why. I didn't list it in his power set
because I didn't really think it would factor into

397
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:56,990
this match, but it's weird that both characters
have that. Yeah, I wasn't even going to mention the

398
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:02,110
telepathic resistance thing, but she does have
like a number of feats regarding those psionic

399
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:06,550
shields. Weird. It's something that I actually
learned about the character during the process of

400
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:10,730
my research for this bio. Well, not that it
matters. Yeah, there's not going to be any

401
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:22,770
telepathy or math. Maybe some math, maybe a little
bit of math. In a world where fantasies collide and

402
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:28,370
heroes clash, one podcast network rises above the
rest. Prepare yourself for the ultimate

403
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:34,750
showdowns in comic books, video games, movies,
and anime. The Dynamite Podcast Network presents

404

407
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:58,390
speculate on the matches and armed with the power
of mathematical simulations, discover who will

408
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:08,150
emerge victorious. Visit dynamicpodcast.com
where we settle the debate and settle the score.

409
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:12,410
Now that we've got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one of the

410
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:17,770
1000 simulated matches will go. The winner is
determined by simulations, not the speculation,

411
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:23,150
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could play
out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?

412
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:27,730
Well, I should say there are no rules, other than
the characters have no prior knowledge of the

413
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:32,650
other going into the fight. All they are aware of
starting out is that the other character is a

414
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:37,010
threat that needs to be eliminated. For the
speculation, the contestants will begin

415
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:42,410
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript
environment that will have no bearing on the match

416
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:47,330
itself, as no environmental statistics are
considered in my simulations. The contestants

417
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:53,490
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright
then, let's get into it. Static and Jubilee meet on

418
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:59,850
the battlefield, who goes first. I'm gonna say
that Static goes first and he'll start off by

419
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:06,290
hopping onto his saucer and zipping right over
Jubilee, blasting her with electric bolts as he

420
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:12,890
flies circles around her. Okay, but Jubilee,
she's gonna dodge these blasts, because she's

421
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:18,590
super agile, so she's doing backhand springs and
flips and stuff to evade his blasts, and while in

422
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:25,010
midair, she's gonna shoot out a plasmoid blast
that has the light intensity of like a flash bank,

423
00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:30,470
and that's gonna blind Static, and so he can't see
where he's flying on his saucer, and he ends up

424
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:36,070
crashing it into the ground and just fucking his
shit up. I'm calling BS on dodging electricity,

425
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:42,910
alright? But sure, let's say she gets lucky and
manages to dodge all of these electric strikes,

426
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:48,310
but she's definitely not blinding him, because he
wears sunglasses as part of his costume, so he does

427
00:39:48,310 --> 00:39:54,450
crash, actually, but intentionally, into her
real hard. Well, I mean, like, Jubilee's right up

428
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:59,370
there with like Nightwing and Daredevil in terms
of agility, so like if Nightwing and like Batman

429
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:04,890
can dodge a hail of bullets, I think it's
reasonable to say that she can dodge Static's

430
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:10,370
blasts. It's more about anticipating where the
blast is gonna go than, you know, being able to move

431
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:15,890
faster than a bullet or lightning or something
like that, and in fact, she's so agile when Static

432
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:21,590
tries to crash into her, Jubilee flips over him,
and she clotheslines him off of his saucer,

433
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:27,210
knocking him to the ground, and then she unloads a
plasmoid blast at his saucer that's powerful

434
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:33,470
enough to destroy it, so he can't fly around
anymore. Actually, his saucer is so agile and thin

435
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:39,470
that it can just dodge her plasmoid blasts, all
right, because even though Static's not on it, he

436
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:45,210
could still control it via electromagnetism.
It's like a video game for him, and he's gonna zip

437
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:50,950
that thing all around her fireworks and right into
her, knocking her to the ground as well. Well, I

438
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:56,250
mean, if it's coming at her, you know, if she missed
blasting it earlier, she's not gonna miss as it's

439
00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:01,530
approaching her, because she's gonna throw her
hands up and unload a fireworks display all around

440
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:08,350
in like a 15 foot radius, and that is definitely
gonna destroy the saucer. Sure, fine, but Static

441
00:41:08,350 --> 00:41:13,290
himself is protected from the fireworks since
he's gonna throw up this electromagnetic force

442
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:20,330
field around him, and once the fireworks are over,
that's when Static puts on his own show with this

443
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:27,990
rapid fire homing chain lightning that there's no
way Jubilee is going to dodge. So she gets shocked

444
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:33,490
real hard and repeatedly. She doesn't need to
dodge it because she can still fight energy with

445
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:38,870
energy, so she just blocks the lightning with
counter blasts from her plasmoids, because

446
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:46,670
essentially lightning energy is plasma anyway,
so yeah, counter. That's fair. Does Jubilee need

447
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:53,130
her hands to emit plasmoids? Like, does it come
from her hands? No, not strictly. Like, she can

448
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:57,610
fire plasmoids from her hands, or she could do
things like create fireworks around herself

449
00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:03,790
without hand direction. Okay, well, you know,
Static can create static fields that make things

450
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:09,470
like magnetically attract and stick to each
other, so I was gonna have him stick her hands to her

451
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:17,390
sides, but we'll say instead that he causes her
head to magnetically attract to the floor, so she

452
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:25,130
just drops straight down and that's going to
interrupt her counter blasts to his electricity,

453
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:30,910
and so she for sure gets zapped. How does he
magnetize something like a head, which is

454
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:36,750
non-magnetic, and make it attract to the ground,
which is also non-magnetic? Like, that doesn't

455
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:42,550
make any sense. He basically just has a sticky
power. Sort of. Well, anything with electrons can

456
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:47,770
be magnetized, and that's one of his powers. He can
magnetize things that can't typically be

457
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:53,270
magnetized. Like, he wants magnetized a guy's
head so that all these guns were attracted to it,

458
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:58,750
essentially. But yeah, so it's like a sticky,
attractive power, and Jubilee just eats the

459
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:03,290
floor. Okay, so she may be stuck and trapped on the
ground, but that's not going to matter because

460
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:09,730
Jubilee can approach nuclear level with her
blasts. Okay, so from the ground, she's just going

461
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:17,750
to emit this fireworks show blasts that has like
the energy of like 10 combined firework finales,

462
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:22,950
like at a firework show. Just, it's just
explosions and colors everywhere that

463
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:28,290
completely engulf static, just vaporizing him
with all that destructive might. Now, I'm

464
00:43:28,290 --> 00:43:34,230
guessing this is like 10 combined, like, little
league firework shows, right? No, this is like 10

465
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:40,450
combined, like, Disneyland level finale
firework shows. Okay. Well, I mean, as this is

466
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:44,770
going on, though, Static's just going to surround
himself with the force field once again. And he's

467
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:50,870
going to run up to her really quick as she's pinned
to the ground. And he's going to Taser touch her,

468
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:55,890
which is going to overload her nervous system with
electricity that's going to cause her to stop with

469
00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:00,970
the fireworks and just become paralyzed instead.
So the match is over. No, no, no, if he gets close

470
00:44:00,970 --> 00:44:06,850
enough for a Taser touch, that means he's like,
well within proximity for Jubilee to just

471
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:12,530
manifest an explosive plasmoid inside his force
field. There doesn't have to be a direct line of

472
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:17,390
sight there. Like, Wolverine once told her that
she could blow up people's heads from the inside if

473
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:24,390
she wanted to. And in this instance, yeah, she
wants to. So she pops off Static's head in the final

474
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:31,750
fireworks display and then it like manifests into
the sparkly design that says, I beat you in

475
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:37,870
fireworks letters. What? Okay, so you're telling
me that Jubilee can get through Magneto's force

476
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:42,810
field? Is that what you're telling me? Like this
whole time, all the X-Men needed to defeat Magneto

477
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:51,150
was fucking Jubilee? No, I would say that Static is
not at the level of Magneto. So no, she couldn't get

478
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:55,830
through Magneto's force field, but she could get
through Static's for sure. That's dumb. That's

479
00:44:55,830 --> 00:45:01,850
dumb. Let's end it here. Let's take it to the stats.
Either Jubilee gets tased to the point of

480
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:08,710
paralysis or Jubilee essentially turns Static's
head into a firework. Let's go ahead and input the

481
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:12,490
character stats, run the simulations and find out
which of those two scenarios is more likely to

482
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:19,910
happen. A.J .9K, hit it! Inputting data, running
calculations, processing results, simulations

483
00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:25,550
complete. All right, well, hopefully
everybody's Fourth of July is just as spectacular

484
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:33,110
and colorful as this speculation was. And ours
impressive as Static's stats were, because he

485
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:39,790
dominated Jubilee in so many categories,
including speed, evasiveness, strength since he

486
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:45,130
could lift things with electromagnetism,
intellect, and versatility. Don't forget

487
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:49,990
perception, because he can listen to radio waves
with his powers. Right. Yeah, we said he was more

488
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:55,110
evasive because he has his force field, he's
faster because he can fly, but we did say that

489
00:45:55,110 --> 00:46:00,710
Jubilee has greater damage potential than Static
does. And she's a better fighter, having received

490
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:07,010
more training. Is that going to be enough to take
this match? Maybe not, but also, yes. That makes

491
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:13,530
literally no sense. Well, according to our
Instagram followers, 72% of them also disagree

492
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:19,190
with me, saying that Static would win. Well, let's
find out if that's the case. Adj9k, the results,

493
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:30,310
please. Hey, you are, sir. The winner of the
matchup between Static and Jubilee is Static. Of

494
00:46:30,310 --> 00:46:39,270
course, Static. This was not even close. He won
83.8% of the 1000 matches or 838 of the 1000

495
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:49,490
battles, with Jubilee only winning 162 or 16.2%.
This was a terrible match. Well, the real question

496
00:46:49,490 --> 00:46:54,850
is who could win in a fight between these two
characters in a video game battle? Like if they

497
00:46:54,850 --> 00:46:59,770
picked up their controllers, I'm guessing
Jubilee would kick Static's ass. No, Static has a

498
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:05,490
degree of technopathy, so she would still lose.
No, powers aren't allowed in this video game

499
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:12,210
tournament. Says who? Says me. I'm saying who's
objectively better at video games. Jubilee is. I

500
00:47:12,210 --> 00:47:17,530
mean, personality-wise, I think the two are
fairly similar when it comes to how geeky they are.

501
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:22,950
So a video game tournament would probably be
closer than the results of this match were. And

502
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:27,750
that's what matters. And that's what matters.
Hey, whatever helps you sleep at night. But that

503
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:35,310
does it for this duel. Adj9k help close us out.

watched the first three episodes already. I'm

510
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:14,450
really looking forward to the last three
episodes, though. Yeah, I haven't started the

511
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:21,070
show yet. I have been rewatching Sandman season
one and lead up to Sandman season two, which starts

512
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:26,390
this week. But yeah, I'll eventually get to Iron
Heart. That does it for this episode. We want to
