Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we review

8
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,600
superhero films and debate the superiority
between Marvel and DC by comparing their

9
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:17,000
characters in stat based battle simulations. I'm
Marvelist Joe and I'm his twin brother Johnny DC.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,720
And in this episode we're going to find out who
would win in a fight between the new gods from DC and

11
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:32,160
the Eternals from Marvel. And one of our final team
duels for this podcast, we knew we wanted to go all

12
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,320
out and pit the two most formidable teams against
each other. I don't know if the Eternals is

13
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,740
Marvel's most formidable team but they are
certainly up there. They basically have all the

14
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:47,880
powers. So I could totally see the new gods getting
dog walked in this matchup. That is the stupidest

15
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:53,480
thing I've ever heard. No way the new gods are
losing this. They are literal gods. And the

16
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,100
Eternals were once worshipped as gods. So there
you go. Before we get into that matchup though

17
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,700
guys, we're going to break down the latest comic
book movie news that came out this past week of

18
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:06,300
which actually were not because there is no news.
But as always we list our segment times in our

19
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,620
episode description so feel free to check out the
show notes if you want to skip ahead to a particular

20
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:16,140

29
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,420
Thanks AJ9K and thanks to everyone who supports
the podcast including Travis Herndon and the

30
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:16,340
Kamacho twins who we are very late in wishing happy
birthday. Yeah, if I could give Gilly and Travis a

31
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:23,660
get for Marvel, I would give Gilly Hawkeye set of
trick arrows and I would give Travis Mr. Fantastic

32
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:32,040
stretch powers. That is random as fuck. I'm gonna
say that since all three of these guys are twins,

33
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,860
since you know we have the running joke that Travis
Herndon is the twin of Travis Bailey, I'm going to

34
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:44,200
give all of them the power of the Wonder Twins.
Which one? Xan or Jan or whatever her name is. The

35
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,500
power to turn into any animal or the power to turn
into any water form. Let's see we'll make Scotty

36
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:56,940
Xan, we'll make Gilly Jaina and we'll make Travis
Gleek. So still the power of stretching, except he

37
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:04,900
could just stretch his tail. Yes, it's his tail.
Happy birthday guys. Be sure to tune into the other

38
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,980
shows and the Dynamite Podcast Network this week

48
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:05,120
notes to listen to all of the shows in the Dynamite
Podcast Network. But with that out of the way.

49
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:13,000
Quick to the No Prize. A No Prize is an award that
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version, the

50
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,280
Dynamic Duel No Prize, is a digital award that we
post on Instagram for the person that we feel gave

51
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:23,480
the best answer to our question of the week. Last
week, we asked you guys, what was your favorite

52
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:30,960
story within the Batman Deadpool crossover comic
and why? And this is coming off of DC publishing the

53
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,480
Batman Deadpool crossover comic, of which there
were a lot of stories, including, of course,

54
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:42,980
Batman Deadpool. There was Harley Quinn Hulk,
Nightwing Wolverine, Miss Marvel and Static and

55
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:50,160
Dr. Strange and Constantine. We received a grand
total of one answer this week from Steve Wozniak,

56
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:58,480
co-founder of Apple. He said. This is the Woz, not
Wozniak. Just simply the Woz. And my favorite part

57
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:04,160
of that comic book is simply Batman. Why does
Batman rocks? He's actually the only thing in DC

58
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:12,820
that rocks because Marvel is better. Marvel is
amazing. And that's all I got to say to that. And

59
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,560
Steve Wozniak's right. Batman is better than
Marvel. Well, what he actually said was that

60
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,760
Marvel was better than all of DC. It was just that
Batman was better than anything else DC had.

61
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:29,980
That's not what I heard. Well, clean your fucking
ears then. Because the Woz does not lie. So the Woz

62
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:35,980
gets this week's No Prize. His name is not actually
Steve Wozniak. It's Josh Wozmont. That's not what

63
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:41,380
I heard. Congrats, Josh, for winning this week's
No Prize. If you, the listener, want a shot at

64
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:45,480
winning your own No Prize, stay tuned to later on
this episode when we'll be asking another

65
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:55,420
question of the week. And now that that's done. On
to the question of the week. Guys, we have

66
00:06:55,420 --> 00:07:02,080
completed all of the review episodes before the
final episode of this podcast in mid January.

67
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:08,320
There's nothing else to review because Wonder Man
got pushed back. So with that said, what review of

68
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:14,840
ours, what review episode of Dynamic Duel did you
get the most out of? Whether you thought it was

69
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:51,380
funny or insightful or way off base, let us know
what stood out to you. But that does it for the

70
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:56,240
upfront portion of this episode. Let's get on to
our main event where we find out who would win

71
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:17,940
between the DC team of the new gods and the Marvel
team of the Eternals. All right, the new gods

72
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:24,820
versus the Eternals. Both of these teams are
members of a race of godlike beings. So this will be

73
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:30,840
quite the clash of Titans as we're actually the
Eternals who live on Saturn's moon of Titan are

74
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,360
called Titans. And that's actually where Thanos
is from. He's actually one of the Titans. Of

75
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:42,240
course, the Eternals had their own movie, which
sucked. The movie did not suck. It was entirely

76
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,920
different from everything else that Marvel had
put out. Not in a bad way. I just don't think it was

77
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,680
what people were expecting. Being a big fan of the
lore of the Eternals, you could definitely listen

78
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:57,880
to our review and hear how I actually enjoyed the
film for what it was. Wait, so remind me, is Thanos a

79
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:03,500
robot person like they are? No, well, he's a member
of a race of beings that were created by the

80
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:08,000
Celestials. They're not robots, though. This
matchup, though, is probably going to be similar

81
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,480
to our Darkseid's elite versus Thanos's Black
Order duel that we did a few months ago. Right,

82
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,060
because the new gods are essentially the good
counterparts to Darkseid's elite, who are also

83
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:26,200
new gods just from Apocalypse, as opposed to New
Genesis. There's a lot of lore surrounding both of

84
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:31,380
these teams. Actually, both the new gods and the
Eternals are creations of comic book legend Jack

85
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:39,200
Kirby. I believe Jack Kirby first created the new
gods for DC and then kind of carried them on back at

86
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,940
Marvel with the Eternals, who are kind of the
spiritual successors of the new gods, I would say.

87
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:50,420
Right, yeah, Eternals is a Jack Kirby ripoff of a
Jack Kirby DC creation. Hey, you can't rip off

88
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:55,820
yourself. That's fair. Can't wait to get into this
duel matchup. First, to explain the methodology

89
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:01,480
behind our duels, let's go to our sentient duel
simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K, tell our

90
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:07,520
listeners how you go about determining a winner in
our duel matchups. Yes, of course, sir. The way I

91
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:12,200
determine a winner between the two teams is by
running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations between

92
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,900
every character on each team using their
statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation is a

93
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:22,100
probabilistic model used to determine outcomes
through random sampling. In this case, I

94
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:26,320
randomize the statistics along a normal
distribution as a way to simulate the many

95
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,300
variables that can occur during battle. The stat
parameters are based on the official Marvel power

96
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:36,580
grid from which the DC characters statistics are
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are

97
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:42,100
included such as range, damage potential,
versatility and perception in order to create a

98
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,460
more detailed and accurate simulation. The
results of the 49000 simulations provide a

99
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:52,460
percentage of wins for each character on both
teams. The team with the higher average win rate is

100
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:56,800
declared the victor as they have a higher
probability to win any given battle. In an

101
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:02,060
equitable pairing, neither team should win 100%
of the matches. The comic book stories have shown

102
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,440
that there's even a way for Batman to defeat
Superman, so the confidence rate of my method

103
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,480
falls in line with the precedents that have been
established in the source material. My

104
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,080
mathematical simulations are without
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole

105
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:21,620
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for
determination of the winner. Thanks AJ and IK.

106
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,540
Before we run the simulations though, we like to
break down each team's histories and rosters

107
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,900
before improvising a scenario on how we imagine
one of the thousands of simulations would play out

108
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:36,080
beat for beat. And I believe it's my turn to go first
with the Marvel team's backstory. So let me tell

109
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:43,280
you all about the Eternals. About a million years
ago, a host of cosmic giants called Celestials

110
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:50,040
visited prehistoric Earth and experimented on
early Homo erectus. Their work produced three

111
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:56,900
branches of humanity. The long-lived Eternals,
the unstable Deviants and ordinary humans, which

112
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:02,340
were seated with the potential to become
superpowered mutants later in evolution. The

113
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:07,620
Eternals were engineered to channel immense
cosmic energy as custodians of the Celestial's

114
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:13,060
mankind experiment, while the Deviants warped
genetics drove them to dominate and terrorize

115
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,540
early humans. As the Eternals multiplied, they
built the city of Olympia in the mountains of

116
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:24,900
Greece. Their power and proximity to the Olympian
gods led ancient Greeks to confuse the two races,

117
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:31,260
and some Eternals even impersonated gods as part
of a treaty, most notably Azura, whose name was

118
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:37,460
changed to Athena, so she could serve as the
earthly Athena before mortal worshipers. An

119
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:43,940
ideological rift soon tore the young race of
Eternals apart. Uranus, brother of the peaceful

120
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:50,160
scientist, Chronos, believed the Eternals
should conquer Earth. Civil war erupted, Chronos

121
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,060
prevailed, and Uranus and his fathers were exiled
into space. They founded a colony on the planet

122
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:02,480
Uranus, where their presence attracted the alien
Kree. When a Kree armada destroyed their ship, the

123
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:09,020
survivors crashed on Saturn's moon Titan and
created a new colony there. Back on Earth, Chronos

124
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:14,480
continued his experiments with cosmic energy
until a catastrophic accident disintegrated his

125
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,700
body and permanently awakened his full power.
With Chronos, now a disembodied entity, the

126
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:27,160
Eternals merged into a unimined and chose
Chronos' son Xurus as the new prime Eternal, while

127
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:34,340
his other son Alars departed the planet to avoid
another schism. Alars traveled to Titan and found

128
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:40,520
the first Eternals colony there devastated with
only one survivor named Sui-san. Together, they

129
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:46,180
rebuilt Titan's society under the guidance of the
artificial intelligence Isaac. Alars and

130
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:53,600
Sui-san's children would define Titan's future,
giving birth to Aros, a carefree adventurer, and

131
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,860
Thanos, a mutant Eternal whose deviant-like
appearance and obsession with death would one day

132
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,720
lead him to massacre most of Titan's population
and to become one of the universe's greatest

133
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:10,260
threats. You can learn more about Thanos in his
duel against Darkseid. The survivors of Titan

134
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:16,240
rebuilt the colony yet again and its Eternals
repeatedly aided Earth's heroes against Thanos,

135
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:23,060
while Aros, eventually known as Starfox, left
Titan to join the Avengers and roam the cosmos as a

136
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:29,660
hero. Back on Earth, Xurus consolidated Eternal
Society in Olympia, near a gateway to the Olympian

137
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:35,400
God's realm. His daughter, Athena, grew into a
scholar and warrior, often acting as the God's

138
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:41,180
representative. Over millennia, she became
entangled with Crow, a deviant warlord who first

139
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:47,660
spared her life in ancient Babylon. Their long,
uneasy romance produced secret twin children,

140
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:53,160
whom Athena hid inside a human surrogate to be
raised as ordinary mortals, even as she continued

141
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:58,560
to command Eternals in battle against deviant
armies. Other Eternals similarly wove

142
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:04,460
themselves into human legend. Icarus helped
shepherd humans during ancient cataclysms and

143
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:10,740
later guided a refugee ship to safety in stories
remembered as the tale of Noah's Ark. Centuries

144
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:16,360
later, while fighting deviance in Greece, he
married a human woman and fathered his son Icarus.

145
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:22,120
The boy died when Mechanical Wings' father built
carried him too high into the atmosphere, and in

146
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:29,020
grief, the Eternal took his son's name. Makari,
another Eternal of Olympia, was fascinated by

147
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,760
speed and technology. Under various aliases, he
taught writing, carried messages for early

148
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:41,200
civilizations, and inspired myths of swift gods,
later operating openly in the 20th century as the

149
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:47,000
speedster Hurricane and then Mercury. Cersei
stood apart from her kin by fully embracing

150
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,980
humanity. A fourth generation Eternal born in
Olympia to Helios and Percy, she delighted in art,

151
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,740
magic, and mortal company, appearing across
history as a performer and benefactor in

152
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:04,680
legendary courts and cities. In the modern era,
after helping repel a major deviant assault on New

153
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:10,300
York, Cersei lived as a Manhattan socialite,
befriending several Avengers and ultimately

154
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:16,380
joined the team herself, entering a complicated
romance with the Black Knight that later tied into

155
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:21,760
her struggle with an eternal mental illness
called Maud Wirie. You can learn more about Cersei

156
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:27,680
in her duel against Firestorm. Humanity's first
broad exposure to the Eternals as a people came

157
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,420
during the arrival of the Celestial's fourth
host. Anticipating their return, Xurus

158
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:39,980
stationed Icarus in an ancient city in the
Peruvian Andes to awaken Ajax, a priestly Eternal

159
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:46,820
who had chosen to sleep between Celestial visits.
With Ajax revived, the Eternals rushed to prepare

160
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:51,780
for the Celestial's descent and clashed with
deviant plots to turn humanity against the

161
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:57,400
towering judges. The Eternals merged into a
unimined to augment the Asgardian destroyer

162
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:03,700
armor in a desperate attack that failed to sway the
Celestial's. The aftermath, the Celestial's

163
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:09,980
spared Earth, destroyed the deviant ruling class
and left Xurus dead, prompting many Eternals to

164
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:15,859
depart the planet while a smaller faction
remained under Thena and then Icarus. In the

165
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:22,380
modern age, eternal deviant tensions continued
as the Lemurian deviant priest lord Gar sought

166
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,859
Celestial power. Thena, who had once sheltered
the deviant gladiators from Lemuria's brutal

167
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:34,200
culling rituals, found herself torn between Crow
and her responsibilities as the new prime Eternal

168
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:40,040
on Earth. The strain left her vulnerable to a
mental brain-mind that Crow had implanted in her

169
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:45,600
mind and her increasingly erratic decisions led
to Icarus eventually challenging and replacing

170
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:51,420
her as the prime Eternal. As the superhero era
unfolded, Cersei, Gilgamesh, and Starfox all

171
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:56,500
served as Avengers, bringing eternal power
directly into Earth's most famous team.

172
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:01,680
Gilgamesh, long known as the Forgotten One for his
earlier interference in human history, briefly

173
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,520
fought alongside Earth's heroes before Grievous
Injury sent him back to Olympia. During this

174
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:12,020
period, Cersei's mental instability worsened
and the Eternals bound her mind to the Black Knight

175
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:18,780
in a soul bond known as a Ganjosen, untangling
their lives until the onslaught crisis scattered

176
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,940
the heroes again. You can learn more about the
Black Knight in his duel against Amethyst. The

177
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:28,800
Eternals' understanding of themselves changed
completely when the childlike trickster Eternal

178
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:34,980
called Sprite rebelled against his unending
existence. Using stolen Eternal technology and

179
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:40,580
the dormant dreaming celestial deep in the
Earth's crust, Sprite rewrote reality so that the

180
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:46,380
Eternals became ordinary humans with fabricated
histories and no knowledge of their true nature.

181
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:52,840
Makari lived as a medical student, Mark Curry,
Cersei as a party planner, Thena as a Stark

182
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:59,600
Enterprise scientist with a husband and young
son, Faistos as an engineer in Sweden, and Icarus

183
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,720
as the mysterious Ike Harris, who alone
remembered fragments of the truth. Their reunion

184
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:11,080
at a European diplomatic party triggered the
return of their powers and set them on a path to

185
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,500
restore their memories. Icarus reestablished
Olympia as their base, while Makari became the

186
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,500
chosen communicator for the awakened dreaming
celestial. The celestial revealed that every

187
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:27,740
seated world receives 100 Eternals and 100
Deviants and that the Celestials stand ready to

188
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:33,020
scour a planet if deviant corruption outweighs
eternal guidance, forcing the Eternals to

189
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:37,500
confront not just Deviants but also the
Celestials' scouting efforts. As they completed

190
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:42,960
the task of reawakening their scattered kin, the
Eternals debated their role toward humanity,

191
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,480
whether to rule, protect, or stand apart, and
ultimately chose distance, even as individuals

192
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,420
like Cersei continued to live among mortals. That
uneasy equilibrium shattered when a corrupted,

193
00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:00,820
final host of Dark Celestials descended on Earth.
When Iron Man and Doctor Strange saw answers from

194
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,800
the Eternals in the mountains of Greece, they
discovered almost all of the Eternals dead by

195
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:11,200
their own hands. Icarus lived long enough to
explain that the Eternals had learned a final,

196
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,240
devastating truth, that they had never been
destined as noble guardians of humanity, but as

197
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:22,380
caretakers meant to defend the Celestial's true
interest in the human race. This revelation drove

198
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:28,180
them into madness and suicide, seemingly ending
the Eternals saga on Earth. However, Celestial

199
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:33,060
Resurrection technology eventually restored
the Eternals once more, to live in a world that no

200
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:37,940
longer clearly needed or trusted them. In this new
age, they grappled with their manufactured

201
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:43,280
purpose and renewed threats from Thanos himself,
who targeted Earth's Eternals on the principle

202
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,560
that only death should be truly eternal. After the
Resurrection, the Eternals discovered that each

203
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:54,240
revival by the machine killed a random human,
shattering their moral certainty and dividing

204
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,820
them between those who wanted to end the system and
those who accepted it. Thanos returned, seized

205
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,240
control of the Resurrection machine, unaware
that the psychic, Eternal Druig had implanted a

206
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:10,820
failsafe designed to destroy him. Thanos used his
brief rule to eliminate rivals until Druig's trap

207
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:16,320
activated, seemingly killing him and further
destabilizing Eternal Society. Druig then

208
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:22,000
claimed leadership as the Primeternal and
labeled mutants as excess deviation, launching

209
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,920
an assault on the mutant island nation of Krakowa
and unleashing the imprisoned warlord Uranus for

210
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:33,900
one hour to devastate Krakowa's counterpart,
Arrakko, on Mars. You can learn more about Krakowa

211
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:40,140
and Arrakko in Krakowa's duel against Danny the
Street. The resulting crisis pushed Ajax and

212
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:45,780
Makari to resurrect the Progenitor Celestial for
guidance, but the Progenitor instead judged

213
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:50,820
Earth unworthy and threatened global
destruction. The Progenitors' defeat ended the

214
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:55,820
conflict but forced the Eternals to confront the
cost of their immortality and the devastation

215
00:21:55,820 --> 00:22:01,100
carried out in their name, leaving their people
fractured and directionless. That's the

216
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:06,460
Eternals backstory. For the seven-member roster
in this team duel against the new gods, I'm going

217
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:14,820
with the following seven Eternals. Cersei,
Icarus, Thena, Makari, Faistos, Gilgamesh, and

218
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:20,780
Starfox. All the Eternals have essentially the
same power set of immortality, near

219
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:27,360
invulnerability, flight, increased strength
and speed, regenerative healing, telepathy,

220
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:33,000
telekinesis, cosmic energy projection,
teleportation, illusion casting,

221
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,320
shapeshifting, molecular reconstruction, and
matter transmutation. However, through

222
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:45,400
training and discipline, many Eternals hone a
specific aspect or specialty of their abilities.

223
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:51,600
Cersei specializes in matter transmutation,
Icarus in cosmic energy projection, Thena in

224
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:57,540
weapons and combat, Faistos in engineering,
Gilgamesh in strength and durability, and

225
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:04,220
Starfox in empathokinesis, meaning he can affect
the emotions of others. They're all at least

226
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:09,620
moderately gifted and intellect having lived for
thousands of years. And that's the Eternals. To

227
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:17,080
reiterate my team is Cersei, Icarus, Thena,
Makari, Faistos, Gilgamesh, and Starfox. Why did

228
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:25,120
you decide to go with Starfox over Druig? That's a
good question. So Druig was in the movie, but I

229
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,800
always thought of Thanos' brother Starfox, who
actually was also in the Eternals movie in the end

230
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:36,640
credit scene played by Harry Styles. I always
thought of him as more of a prominent Eternals

231
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,820
character with his ability of empathokinesis. I
largely saw Druig's telepathy as unnecessary

232
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:49,280
because I could get the same effect of quote
unquote mind control using Starfox. Gotcha. I do

233
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:54,440
think it's pretty lame that they all essentially
have the same powers. That's a pretty impressive

234
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,640
power set. I don't think that's lame for me. I think
it's, yeah, for sure lame for the new gods because

235
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,360
they're going to get their ass beat. Basically the
Eternals have all the powers. Sure, a lot of them

236
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,780
specialize in some abilities at the expense of
other abilities, but you're going to have a real

237
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:15,620
hard time dealing with the Eternals versatility.
Maybe, maybe it won't matter. We'll see. Let me get

238
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:22,700
into the new gods backstory. Long ago, before time
as it is now understood, the cosmos was ruled by a

239
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:28,960
pantheon of beings known as the Old Gods, who waged
a catastrophic war amongst themselves on the

240
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,600
world of Urgrund. The conflict culminated in the
cataclysmic event known as Ragnarok, which tore

241
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:42,960
Urgrund asunder. From its destruction rose two
diametrically opposed worlds, Apocalypse, a

242
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:48,880
smoldering furnace of tyranny and suffering, and
New Genesis, a verdant realm of peace and

243
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,560
enlightenment. These twin worlds occupied the
sphere of the gods and were populated by a new race

244
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:02,840
of beings, immortal, evolved, and godlike. They
called themselves the New Gods. Apocalypse came

245
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:09,660
under the dominion of the malevolent dark side,
who ruled with absolute cruelty. New Genesis was

246
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:15,160
led by the wise warrior, Isiah, who became
Highfather after communing with the mysterious

247
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:21,640
cosmic force known as the Source. Highfather
transformed the floating city of Supertown into

248
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:27,160
the capital of New Genesis and established a
culture built on peace, wisdom, and divine

249
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:32,840
ascension. But tensions between the two worlds
escalated into a devastating war after

250
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:39,600
Darkseid's uncle Steppenwolf murdered Isiah's
wife, Avaya. In retaliation, Isiah slew

251
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:45,280
Steppenwolf and ignited a war between Apocalypse
and New Genesis that threatened to consume the

252
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:54,720
universe. Seeking a temporary end to the
violence, the pact between New Genesis and

253
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:01,280
Apocalypse. Highfather and Darkseid agreed to
exchange their sons as wards. Orion, son of

254
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,780
Darkseid, was sent to be raised in New Genesis
under Highfather's guidance, while

255
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:12,200
Highfather's own son, later named Scott Free, was
consigned to the brutal orphanages of Granny

256
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:18,300
Goodness on Apocalypse. Though the exchange
forced an uneasy truce, hostilities resumed when

257
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:24,100
Darkseid set his sights on Earth, believing its
inhabitants collectively held fragments of the

258
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:31,200
elusive anti-life equation, a formula capable of
eliminating free will throughout the universe.

259
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,160
The renewed war was fought not only across the
stars, but also on Earth, where the new gods allied

260
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:43,360
with heroes such as Superman to repel Apocalyptic
incursions. In times, Scott Free escaped

261
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:49,720
Apocalypse and returned to New Genesis as the
master escape artist Mr. Miracle, joined by a

262
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:55,260
fellow fugitive and formidable warrior, Big
Barda. You could learn more about Inher Duel

263
00:26:55,260 --> 00:27:01,740
against Ronan the Accuser. Orion, despite his
apocalyptic lineage, embraced the values of New

264
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:07,640
Genesis and became its fiercest defender, often
fighting alongside the radiant warrior,

265
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,660
Lightray. You could learn more about Orion and his
duel against the Silver Surfer. Both Orion and

266
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:18,760
Lightray led numerous campaigns against
Apocalypse's forces, including brutal battles

267
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:23,940
in the fire pits of Armageddo and the skies above
Earth. To bolster their efforts against

268
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:29,700
Darkseid, Highfather supported the emergence of
the Forever People, a team of young new gods

269
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:35,920
empowered to summon the mighty Infinity Man, who
was secretly Drax, Highfather's brother, and the

270
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:41,840
original intended heir to Apocalypse before
Darkseid's rise. Even the lower caste of New

271
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:48,320
Genesis, represented by the brave bug warrior
Forager, rose to prominence during this time,

272
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:54,040
proving vital in numerous conflicts and bridging
the social divide between Supertown and the

273
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,300
insect colonies below. Through his wonder staff
and communion with the Source, Highfather

274
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:04,940
presided over battles not just of strength but of
cosmic consequence. When Darkseid sought to

275
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:10,000
breach the Source Wall and harness the Source for
himself, Highfather assembled the gods of other

276
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:16,840
Pantheons, including Zeus and Odin, to form a
composite being known as the One. Together they

277
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:22,580
entered the Source to stop cosmic collapse caused
by the God Wave, a universal surge of divine

278
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:28,440
energy. Highfather perished in the effort,
sacrificing himself to protect reality, though

279
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:34,220
his essence remained one with the Source. After
Highfather's death, his mantle was offered to his

280
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:41,920
son, Scott Free, who declined the role, leading it
to pass instead to Tachyon, a human imbued with

281
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:48,620
Source energy to guide New Genesis. Even in death,
Highfather continued to appear to others as part

282
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:54,320
of the cosmic quintessence, overseeing events
that threatened reality. The New Gods suffered

283
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,780
their darkest hour when the sentient Source
turned against its creations, determined to

284
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:06,720
usher in a more perfect fifth world The source
employed the Infinity Man to eliminate the flawed

285
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,360
gods of the fourth world. One by one, the new gods
fell, until only Darkseid and his son Orion

286
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:20,120
remain. In the final conflict, Orion tore out his
father's heart, delivering justice in the name of

287
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:26,620
the fallen. The source merged Apocalypse and New
Genesis into a single world, signaling the end of

288
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:31,400
the fourth world. In the wake of their
destruction, the new gods were reborn in the realm

289
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:39,200
of Earth 5.1, reconstructed by the monitor Nix
Uhtun after the events of the final crisis. You can

290
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,340
learn more about the monitor in his duel against
the Watcher. As Darkseid's essence attempted to

291
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:49,960
conquer Earth from within the body of Metropolis
Detective Dan Turpin, the remaining new gods

292
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:56,820
returned in more evolved forms. Metron, Black
Racer, and others reemerged to guide and protect

293
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:02,840
creation. With the fall of Darkseid, the gods of
New Genesis resumed their stewardship, their

294
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:08,660
spirits reborn to guide a new age. After the
timeline-altering Flashpoint event, the

295
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:15,800
history of the new gods was rewritten. In this new
continuity, Ixaya and Uxas, or Darkseid, were

296
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:21,800
once peasants on the world of Urgrund, ruled by the
destructive Old Gods. When the war among the

297
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:28,180
deities erupted, Uxas manipulated the conflict,
stole their powers, and transformed into the

298
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:35,000
being known as Darkseid. Ixaya pleaded with the
gods for salvation, and one dying god gifted him

299
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,720
the power of the Alpha Effect. Reborn as
Highfather, Ixaya battled his brother in a clash

300
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,800
that destroyed their world. From the ruins, Ixaya
forged the floating city of Supertown and

301
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:52,700
rechristened his people, the new gods of New
Genesis. Though Highfather led with strength and

302
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:59,020
resolve, the devastation wrought by war hardened
him. The death of his second wife at Darkseid's

303
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:06,340
hands reignited hostilities, culminating in a
second pact. As before, Orion was sent to New

304
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:12,820
Genesis, and Highfather's infant son, Scott, was
given to Apocalypse. Though the truce held, it did

305
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,460
little to prevent Darkseid's continued conquest
of the Multiverse, and Highfather became

306
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:23,280
increasingly authoritarian in his governance.
Years later, as new threats emerged, Highfather

307
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:30,340
sought to end the eternal conflict once and for all
by acquiring the Life Equation, an antithesis to

308
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:36,060
Darkseid's Anti-Life Equation. To that end, he
dispatched the Council of Aids to retrieve the

309
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:42,200
emotional spectrum rings from the Lantern Cores
and captured the White Lantern Kyle Raynor, who

310
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:47,360
you learn more about in his duel against Null.
Though Highfather claimed his actions were

311
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:53,160
noble, he used the Life Equation to transform
innocent beings into soldiers in his war,

312
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:58,880
including the citizens of the planet Moos. When
confronted by the Lantern Cores and his own

313
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:05,440
people, Highfather recognized his descent into
tyranny. In a moment of clarity, he relinquished

314
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,840
the Life Equation and sought redemption. He
helped save New Genesis from the revived Source

315
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:16,900
Titans, acknowledging the need to rebuild both
the trust of his people and the shattered order of

316
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:22,500
their society. Darkseid meanwhile perished in
battle against the Justice League, consumed by

317
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:27,860
the power of Anti-Life. His disappearance
created a cosmic imbalance that the universe

318
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:36,160
attempted to correct by giving rise to a new God of
Evil, an emergent infant named Kamal. Orion,

319
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:42,000
tasked by New Genesis to destroy the child before
he could awaken his godhood, found himself torn

320
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,480
between duty and conscience. Refusing to carry
out the execution, Orion defied the edicts of

321
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:54,400
Supertown and fled with the child, triggering
political upheaval across the realm. In the wake

322
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:59,900
of Orion's defection, an alien race known as the
Nektari, who were descendants of the forgotten

323
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:06,200
old god Nektar and former slaves of Apocalypse,
emerged from the shadows of the cosmos and

324
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,720
launched a genocidal crusade against all
fourth-world gods. The Nektari declared

325
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:18,120
themselves heirs to the divine legacy lost in the
fall of the old gods and viewed both New Genesis and

326
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:24,160
Apocalypse as aberrations born from blasphemy.
Their assault culminated in the destruction of

327
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:30,440
Supertown, forcing the surviving new gods into
exile. In the battle's final moments, Lightray

328
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:36,620
was slain defending the celestial bridge from
Nektari warships, his body igniting into radiant

329
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:42,420
flame visible across the multiverse. Scattered
and wounded, the remnants of the new gods

330
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:48,340
established a refugee fleet shepherded by
Metron's Mobius chair across forgotten star

331
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:54,200
lanes in search of safe harbor. Big Barda and Mr.
Miracle led rescue operations to salvage

332
00:33:54,200 --> 00:34:00,000
survivors from the ruins of Supertown, while
foragers people, long overlooked, rose to the

333
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,220
front lines as guerrilla fighters. Highfather,
stripped of his capital and humbled by war,

334
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:12,139
governed from a fractured command, relying on
Tachyon to maintain communion with the source.

335
00:34:12,139 --> 00:34:19,100
Orion, now a fugitive among his own people, raised
Kamal in hiding, seeking to guide the child away

336
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:24,840
from the shadow of Darkseid. The war with the
Nektari marked the twilight of the fourth world,

337
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:30,820
as the new gods fought not for dominion or dogma,
but for survival. And that's the new gods history

338
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:38,699
so far. Now for my seven-member roster, I'm going
with Orion, Mr. Miracle, Big Barda, Light Ray,

339
00:34:38,699 --> 00:34:45,880
Metron, Forager, and Becca. Orion is Darkseid's
son, raised in Supertown, a brutal warrior with

340
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:52,360
superhuman strength, speed, durability, and the
power of the Astro Force, an explosive energy he

341
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:58,100
projects from his harness in battle. Mr. Miracle
is the universe's greatest escape artist, armed

342
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:04,680
with a sentient mother box computer and high-tech
gadgets that let him fly, phase, and break through

343
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:10,880
any trap or barrier. Big Barda is a fierce
frontline combatant raised by granny goodness of

344
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,920
apocalypse, wielding her indestructible mega
rod and enhanced armor. Light Ray is a radiant and

345
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,180
optimistic warrior who manipulates solar
energy, granting him light speed, flight, laser

346
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:29,040
precision blasts, and blinding luminescence.
Metron is an aloof observer of reality who

347
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:35,240
traverses time, space, and dimensions with his
Mobius chair, granting him unlimited knowledge,

348
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:41,160
teleportation, and technological control.
Forager is a swift and agile warrior from New

349
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:47,480
Genesis' bug colony, Cast, fighting with
energy-based stingers, mines, and exo-armor.

350
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:53,040
And for the seventh member of my roster, I'm going
with Orion's wife, Becca, the goddess of love

351
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,580
capable of inspiring overwhelming devotion in
others while wielding advanced New Genesis

352
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:05,060
technology, including a phase-shifting suit
that grants her invisibility and intangibility.

353
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:10,440
I do want to say that I originally wanted to use
Highfather in this duel, but Joseph's a big fat

354
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:17,680
cheater who would not allow me to do so. No, I mean,
I'm not using Mentor or Zurus or anything like

355
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,880
that. So yeah, you can't use Highfather. He's just
too powerful, I think, for this group. So to

356
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:29,380
reiterate, my seventh member roster consists of
Orion, Mr. Miracle, Big Barda, Light Ray, Metron,

357
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:36,120
Forager, and Becca. Yeah, it's a good team. I like
how the history of the New Gods is no less

358
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,220
convoluted than the history of the Eternals. I
actually think it got better with the

359
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:46,500
post-Flashpoint retcon. It's not Jack Kirby, but
it is pretty cool. Yeah, the Eternals got

360
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:51,400
retconned a few times as well, even by Neil Gaiman.
But I think really actually the movie helped

361
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:57,340
solidify some of those ideas that Jack Kirby
originally had, and they've since brought some of

362
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:56,040
those concepts into the comic book universe as
well. The holidays are just a few weeks away, and if

369
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:38,680
histories and rosters out of the way, let's
speculate on how one of the simulated matches will

370
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,640
go. The winners determined by simulations, not
the speculation, but it's fun to imagine how the

371
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:49,500
fight could play out. A.J. and I.K., what are the
rules of our speculation? Well, I should say there

372
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:54,620
are no rules, other than the teams have no prior
knowledge of the other going into the fight. All

373
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:59,720
they are aware of starting out is that the other
side is a threat that needs to be eliminated. For

374
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:04,280
the speculation, the groups will begin
approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript

375
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,340
environment that will have no bearing on the match
itself, as no environmental statistics are

376
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:14,660
considered in my simulations. The teams must earn
victory on their own merit. Alright then, let's

377
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:20,980
get into it. The new gods and the Eternals meet on
the battlefield who goes first. I'm actually

378
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:26,300
going to say that Lightray starts off the match
since he's the fastest one out of both of the teams

379
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:32,900
and he's going to begin by emitting this blinding
flash of light that is going to blind all of the

380
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:38,940
Eternals and that's going to allow Orion to
unleash this wide astrophors blast against the

381
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:44,140
entire team while they're trying to blink the
light out of their eyes. So they're all just

382
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:50,560
basically destroyed from the get go. Okay, but
Eternals, I mean they have eyes that can adapt to

383
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:56,020
brightness and darkness better than humans. So
like this flash of light by Lightray, it doesn't

384
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:00,840
affect them more than it would like a normal human
looking at a bright light bulb. So not too bad. You

385
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:08,160
know, like they witness Orion about to unleash his
astrophors. So Cersei is going to construct a wall

386
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,680
shielding them that's made out of pure diamond and
Makari, you know, my resident speedster, she's

387
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:19,380
going to phase through the wall and straight up
pinball herself among the new gods, just you know,

388
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:24,640
karate chopping some of them in the head, kicking
others in the chest and like judo tossing at least

389
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,380
one of them. But like for sure knocking down each
one of the new gods on their ass. A diamond wall

390
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:35,580
wouldn't be much of a shield against the
astrophors, but sure, we'll say a stand's long

391
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:40,940
enough for Makari to get through it before you know
it becomes diamond dust, essentially. Luckily

392
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:46,540
enough for the new gods, though, I'm going to say
that the first one Makari approaches happens to be

393
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:53,120
Becca, the new goddess of love, who is constantly
radiating empathic waves that force those in

394
00:40:53,120 --> 00:41:00,720
proximity to her to fall in love with her. So while
Makari suddenly becomes smitten with her, Big

395
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:07,960
Barda is going to use her Mega Rod as like this jet to
launch herself straight into the biggest guy on

396
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:13,680
your team, Gilgamesh, and she's just going to
pummel him with her rod. I don't know why that

397
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:19,960
sounds gross, but it does. But Gilgamesh, like
he's so fucking strong, he's going to straight up

398
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,400
catch Big Barda's Mega Rod as she's like bringing
it down on him, and he's going to just snap it like a

399
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:30,580
twig before feeding one of the broken ends to her,
just like busting her right in the face. Then

400
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:36,800
Thena, just out of thin air, she conjures a Mega Rod
of her own, except it's going to be three times as

401
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:43,960
long and twice as girthy, and it also has a blade at
the end, like a spear, and she uses it to fire a blast

402
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:50,480
at Barda that knocks Barda off of Gilgamesh. Okay,
first of all, the Mega Rod is apocalyptic in

403
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:57,520
technology. There's no way Gilgamesh breaks it,
bends it, maybe, but you know, a Baren rod is

404
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,860
nothing to be ashamed of, you know. Barda just
angles it slightly when she uses it, and she's

405
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:09,420
going to use it to counter Thena's blast with one of
her own. And because Mr. Miracle saw Thena try to

406
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:15,980
attack his wife, he's going to get between them and
whip out his multi-cube that he's going to use to

407
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:22,380
fire this unbreakable net around Thena, which
pins her to the ground. Thena would just teleport

408
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:28,680
out of the net. So no big deal there. Faistos is
going to use his Warhammer to smash Mr. Miracle's

409
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:34,840
multi-cube, and then he's going to throw out a
gadget that ensnares Mr. Miracle in this, like,

410
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:41,200
intricate trap. It kind of looks like a golden
four-dimensional clock with, like, these gears

411
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:48,540
that distort time and make whoever is trapped
inside of it go back in time with every motion Mr.

412
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:53,660
Miracle makes. So it's basically impossible to
escape from. Well, I wouldn't say that. It just

413
00:42:53,660 --> 00:43:00,980
means he needs to break out of it in one motion. And
that's going to be easy. He will use his mother box

414
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:06,680
to generate a boom tube around him, and that's
going to allow him to escape the trap by falling

415
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:14,720
into a boom tube. Meanwhile, Forager is going to
douse Faistos and his hammer with a stream of acid

416
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:20,100
from his acid pod on his wrist, and that's going to
disintegrate him. Except Cersei just turns that

417
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:28,140
acid into clone midair before it lands on Faistos.
So all Forager did was make Faistos smell like a

418
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:34,120
suave motherfucker. That's when Icarus just
flies right through Forager, turning him into,

419
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:40,000
like, this cockroach smear on the battlefield.
Okay, but actually Icarus is just going to bounce

420
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:46,640
right off of Forager's bug shield that he was
wearing on his back. So, ha ha. We'll say Forager

421
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:51,480
does get smashed into the ground, but you know,
he's pretty resilient, so he'll be fine.

422
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:59,060
Meanwhile, Metron is going to catch Icarus in a
tractor beam and teleport him near Becca. So now

423
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:05,940
she's in control of both Makari and Icarus, and
because they're under her thrall, they're going

424
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:13,520
to start attacking the other Eternals at super
fast sonic speed. Okay, except when Icarus and

425
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:20,780
Makari try and attack Starfox, he gets them under
his thrall, so they don't want to hurt him or his

426
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:26,160
teammates the rest of the Eternals. And then
Starfox is going to extend his apathokinesis to

427
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:32,320
Becca, so Becca falls in love with Starfox too, and
therefore she drops Icarus and Makari completely

428
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:40,740
out of their empathic days, and Becca straight up
starts making out with Starfox. What? Okay, well

429
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:47,780
that's going to piss off Orion since that's his
wife, and we'll say it enrages him so much that it's

430
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:55,100
going to short-circuit his mother box, which is
usually what keeps his innate rage in check. So,

431
00:44:55,100 --> 00:45:02,180
with his power unleashed, Orion, who at this point
is irrational and made impossible to be affected

432
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:08,440
by Starfox's empathic power, he's going to plow
straight into Starfox at light speed on his astral

433
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:16,780
harness, while engulfed in astrophors energy.
So, Starfox gets vaporized, after which Orion's

434
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:22,900
mother box is going to repair itself and restore
Orion's mind. I guess that's fair, considering he

435
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:28,960
did make out with Orion's wife and all. Yeah, but
you know what? Orion's going to be angry again when

436
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,620
Thena shoots a bolt from her cosmic energy
crossbow that's going to strike Becca right

437
00:45:34,620 --> 00:45:41,820
between her eyes, so Becca's out. Yeah, Becca has a
phase shifter built into her suit that makes her

438
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:48,420
intangible, and you know, she probably activated
that at the very start of this match, smartly. So,

439
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:57,720
that bolt is actually going to hit Gilgamesh
instead, which is going to take him out. No, he's

440
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:03,940
fine, but Becca may be intangible, but Cersei's
just going to force her to become tangible, either

441
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:11,540
by like turning her phase shifter into dust or like
even just rendering her molecule solid. Either

442
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:19,260
way, Becca does not survive Thena's next bolt,
which fires from her crossbow. So, Becca's out,

443
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:26,340
and Orion's not going to do shit about this,
because Faistos slaps a magnetic technology

444
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:32,480
hacker onto Orion's astro harness, and that's
going to infect Orion's mother box with a

445
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:39,020
celestial virus that causes him to become docile,
and like so docile, in fact, that he just lets

446
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:45,240
Icarus hurl him into outer space, never to return.
Oh, dang, that was a good move, actually. All

447
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:51,880
right, well, I'm going to say by this point, Mr.
Miracle Boomtube is back into the match, and right

448
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:58,840
away, he's going to quickly grab Gilgamesh and
toss him into the tube before it closes. So,

449
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:06,120
Gilgamesh also never returns to the match.
Meanwhile, Big Barda uses her mega rod to teleport

450
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:13,560
behind Icarus, and she's going to use that rod to
garot and kill him. Okay, she's choking him out

451
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:20,340
with the mega rod. Still sounds gross. He wrestles
to free himself from getting choked out, but his

452
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:25,660
eyes are still free. He's going to shoot massively
powerful cosmic eye beams at forager that just

453
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:33,060
incinerate the guy. So, Icarus may be out, like he
gets taken out by Barda choking him, but he's also

454
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:39,060
going to take that cockroach guy with him, and then
suddenly, Mikari steals Barda's mega rod and then

455
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:44,600
uses her speed power to phase the rod through her
chest, just impaling her and taking her out of the

456
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:52,440
match. Is Mikari a man or a woman? Well, both.
Mikari started out as a man then was resurrected as

457
00:47:52,440 --> 00:48:02,600
a woman in her latest incarnation. Oh, okay. So,
Barda's out, but as Mikari proceeds to zip around,

458
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:07,880
I'm going to say Light Ray flies out in front of her
path and stays in front of her no matter where she

459
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:15,240
turns as he blasts her with a series of lasers,
taking out each leg before beaming her right

460
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:20,800
between the eyes. So, she's out. Okay. I mean,
while Light Ray was so focused on eliminating

461
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:27,040
Mikari and staying in front of her, one thing he
didn't notice was his own decapitation by Theanus

462
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:32,480
Sword. So, he like lasers Mikari out of the match,
and then all of a sudden, he sees his own body. He's

463
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:38,340
like, oh, shit, there's my body. Oh, no, I'm dead.
Jeez. Actually, I'm going to say that Metron just

464
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:44,060
rewinds time. So, that Light Ray is no longer
decapitated. Now, he's just going to duck below

465
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:50,980
Theanus Sword and sever her torso in half with a
laser beam. So, she's actually the one that's

466
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:56,600
taken out. Time manipulation is bullshit. What
controls Metron's time powers? Is it, it's his

467
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:03,660
chair, right? Yeah, the Mobius chair. I'm going to
say that it is now the Mobius pilot dog shit,

468
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:09,940
because Cersei is going to transform Metron's
chair into dog shit. So, now Metron is sitting on

469
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:15,780
it, and he's like, eww, gross, I'm sitting on this
big ass pile of dog shit. And then, he and his pile of

470
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:21,900
dog shit get turned into marble. So, he's a marble
statue now that will forever commemorate that

471
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:27,480
one-time Metron sat on a big ass stinky pile of
sloppy dog shit. That is the most disrespectful

472
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:33,820
thing you've ever said. I feel like Metron also
would have seen that coming. But whatever, Mr.

473
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:40,140
Miracle, he's going to use his mother box to
transmute Cersei into, I don't know, what's worse

474
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:46,420
than shit? Vomit? Nothing. A pile of vomit. That's
what Cersei is now. Alright, so who, I only have

475
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:53,160
Faistos left. Right, and I have Mr. Miracle and
Light Ray. Okay. So, Faistos, he's going to throw

476
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:59,740
out a device, a celestial technology device that
transforms into a portable version of the

477
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:05,380
Eternals Resurrection Engine. And this is going
to awaken a whole new set of the same Eternals that

478
00:50:05,380 --> 00:50:11,080
you knew gods just destroyed or removed from the
battle. And then Icarus, now resurrected, he's

479
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:16,120
the head Eternal, he's going to start the Unimined
Ritual by creating this pillar of blue flame that

480
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:23,300
all the other Eternals fly into, and that is going
to form the Unimined, which is a composite being

481
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:29,360
that together is like more powerful than the sum of
its parts. That's right, you're totally screwed.

482
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:35,000
The fuck? He's like Infinity Man? Sure. I still
don't quite know who Infinity Man is. It's High

483
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,920
Father's Brother or whatever. This is a composite
being of Eternals. It's like a floating energy

484
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:45,520
head with all the powers that can take on any form it
wants to actually. And so this Unimined is going to

485
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:51,360
compress matter inside of Light Ray's body into
this mini black hole that causes him to implode.

486
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:56,200
That's going to kill him. And the mini black hole
also sucks in Mr. Miracle. Like, Light can't

487
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:01,040
escape a black hole. How the hell is Mr. Miracle
going to escape a black hole? He's not that smash

488
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:08,280
over. That was awesome. Escape a black hole? I
mean, that'd be easy, actually. Like all Mr.

489
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:15,000
Miracle has to do is take over this Unimined by
reciting the Anti-Life equation, which he knows.

490
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:21,900
And with the Unimined under his control, not only
does he close up the black hole, but the match is

491
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:29,420
over since to be under the control of Anti-Life is
essentially death. What good is the Anti-Life

492
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:37,940
equation if Mr. Miracle is unable to speak? What?
Because the Unimined just erased his mouth and Mr.

493
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:42,200
Miracle gets sucked into the black hole. I don't
know. I mean, Mr. Miracle doesn't have to speak it

494
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:47,720
out loud. He could think it. I'm assuming the
Unimined is psychic. So it probably still hears

495
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:53,440
the equation in Mr. Miracle's mind. How is Mr.
Miracle going to think this equation before he

496
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,580
dies, before he gets sucked into the black hole?
That's dumb. We'll just say he resets it before the

497
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:03,980
Eternals even had time to form the Unimined. Like
you're saying Faistos was able to activate this

498
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:10,300
celestial machine, recreate the Eternals, have
them form the Unimined and form the black hole

499
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:16,700
before he could recite the equation? No way.
That's wishful thinking. That's bullshit. It

500
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:23,040
could happen. Sure, why not? Okay, that is a lot of
steps. We'll go ahead and leave the match there.

501
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:28,620
Either Faistos and the Eternals are able to form
the Unimined, which in turn creates a black hole

502
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:35,220
that destroys Lightray and Mr. Miracle, or Mr.
Miracle recites the Anti-Life equation taking

503
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:41,080
control of the Unimined or the Eternals and ending
their lives. We'll go ahead and leave the match up

504
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:46,920
there, input the character stats, run the
simulations and come back with the winner. AJ9K,

505
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:54,300
hit it! Inputting data, running calculations,
processing results, simulations complete. Man,

506
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:59,220
I was really looking forward to using the Unimined
against you, but you're right. Like it just, it was

507
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:04,120
just too many steps. I don't think I could pull that
off quite cleanly. I'm just glad Mr. Miracle

508
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:09,500
survived to the end of that speculation to use the
Anti-Life equation because I'm not sure how else I

509
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:14,840
would have overcome the Unimined. Not that the
speculation matters, it all comes down to stats in

510
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:20,340
the end of what you were right. The Eternals
stomped on the new gods when it came to

511
00:53:20,340 --> 00:53:25,000
versatility. That was the biggest discrepancy
between both teams. Yeah, the Eternals

512
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,020
definitely had the edge over the new gods when it
came to versatility considering they have

513
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:36,080
basically all the powers, but the new gods did
stomp the Eternals when it came to evasiveness,

514
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:41,540
largely because characters like Becca, Mr.
Miracle, and Metron are over and above highly

515
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:48,180
evasive. Both teams were fairly durable, fairly
fast, they were pretty much even when it came to

516
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:54,200
damage level, actually, and their range was also
very similar. Overall, it looks like the Eternals

517
00:53:54,200 --> 00:54:01,060
were a group of better fighters, which surprised
me. Yeah, Acheris, Stina, Gilgamesh, they're all

518
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:05,440
really well-adept fighters who have lived for
close to a million years, quite a lot of experience

519
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:10,420
under their belt. Whereas someone like Metron,
like have you ever seen Metron throw a punch even?

520
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:16,860
No, actually, he had the lowest fighting stat out
of anyone on either team. That being said, he was

521
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:22,280
still the most powerful member overall. Yeah,
Metron was by far the most powerful character. He

522
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:30,160
had a win rate of 82.1%, though I also had the
weakest member of the other side with Forager, who

523
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:37,380
only had a win rate of 24.4%. Most of my Eternals
were actually right around the same level

524
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:46,920
stat-wise, and so a lot of them also had around the
same win rate, ranging from about 55% to 45% win

525
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:52,540
rate. People like Gilgamesh excelled in
strength, McCurry, and speed, things like that,

526
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:57,180
but overall, they were pretty well balanced. That
being said, Jonathan, can the new gods overcome

527
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:02,560
that level of versatility and balance? I think so.
I mean, I think the Eternals are not specialized

528
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:09,000
enough, I would say. Not as much as the new gods, and
I think that's going to be in the new gods' favor.

529
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:16,760
And Instagram agrees with me. Of those who took our
Instagram poll, 62% sided with the new gods, which

530
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:21,020
is lame because the new gods haven't even had a
movie, so I think that's just a lot of people

531
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:25,560
hating. Well, some of the new gods made an
appearance in Zack Snyder's Justice League. I

532
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:30,860
mean, no one who's on my team, they're all from
Apocalypse, but people know about them. I don't

533
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:38,360
think they do, but let's see which team won. Age of
9K, the results please. Alright, the winner

534
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:50,620
between the new gods and the Eternals is... The new
gods. Yes! Not by much though. Not by much. Not even

535
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:55,740
close to what you are probably hoping for, out of
the thousands of simulated matches, the new gods

536
00:55:55,740 --> 00:56:02,860
only won 51.2% of the time, whereas the Eternals
won 48.8%. So what you're saying is that the new

537
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:10,940
gods aren't stoppable. What I'm saying is the new
gods are big fucking losers, and they can go fuck

538
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:17,540
themselves, and I hate them. That's what I'm
saying. Geez, jealous much? I'm not jealous

539
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:23,280
because I know at the end of the day the new gods are
inferior. Clearly not! Well, if they weren't,

540
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:27,060
then they would have had a movie made about them
already. Wouldn't they have? That's what I

541
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:31,680
thought. You mean a shitty movie? Yeah, if they had
a movie made about them, it would have been shitty.

542
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:37,660
Yeah. No, I mean, the Eternals movie was shitty.
Fuck you. Never mind. In the end, I don't feel too

543
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:41,920
bad because it was such a close matchup. It's
almost a coin toss really. And it looks like the

544
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:50,420
coin came up. New gods. That's stupid. You lose,
bitch! But that does it for this team duel. AJ9K,

545
00:56:50,420 --> 00:57:25,800
help close us out. Alright, our next episode is
going to be an individual duel. We're going to find

546
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:32,140
out who would win in a fight between Gypsy, who I
