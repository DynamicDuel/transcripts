1
00:00:03,284 --> 00:00:03,345
you

2
00:00:24,862 --> 00:00:29,463
A weekly show where we review superhero films
and debate the superiority between Marvel and

3
00:00:29,483 --> 00:00:35,345
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based
Battle simulations. I'm Johnny DC and I'm his

4
00:00:35,385 --> 00:00:41,606
twin brother Marvelous Joe and in this episode
We are reviewing venom which just came out

5
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:46,028
last week It's kind of a controversial movie
among for sure for sure among the general public

6
00:00:46,188 --> 00:00:50,109
maybe not necessarily fans I think for the most
part fans really liked it. Yeah, but either

7
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:54,626
way, I'm super excited to talk about it I did
not hate it, surprisingly. I thought I would

8
00:00:54,886 --> 00:00:58,188
because of all the comparisons to like Catwoman
and stuff like that. Oh, that was fucking bullshit.

9
00:00:58,228 --> 00:01:04,471
Yeah, Lady Gaga fans. I blame them. Screw whoever
said that. But before we get into that, just

10
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:10,373
a reminder, this is our 92nd episode. We are
counting down to our 100th episode, which will

11
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:15,496
happen in early December, I believe, and we
have a big surprise. Can't talk about it yet,

12
00:01:15,896 --> 00:01:20,958
but only eight more episodes to go after this.
Yep. It's going by fast. In this episode, we'll

13
00:01:20,978 --> 00:01:25,501
be breaking down the news from the past week.
A lot of news. Yeah, a ton of news. Yeah, because

14
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:29,703
of New York Comic-Con. Yeah, and a lot of them
are videos. There's the Aquaman Extended video.

15
00:01:30,003 --> 00:01:34,385
There's the Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse
Official Trailer 2. We're going to be talking

16
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:39,428
about Rosie Perez being cast in Birds of Prey.
I think that's like the one non-video news

17
00:01:39,508 --> 00:01:46,432
item. There's two trailers for Daredevil Season
3. A Titans final trailer. And then a Harley

18
00:01:46,472 --> 00:01:52,059
Quinn animated series first look. So... Yeah,
a ton of stuff to go over and break down. The

19
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:55,620
news itself could almost be the entire episode.
But yeah, after that, we'll get into the Venom

20
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:00,202
review. Just real quick. Usually we save this
for the end of the episode, but right now we

21
00:02:00,222 --> 00:02:07,225
are trying to get to 200 ratings specifically
on iTunes because Rotten Tomatoes has recently

22
00:02:07,505 --> 00:02:12,907
changed their standards for what qualifies as
a Rotten Tomatoes approved critic, which includes

23
00:02:12,947 --> 00:02:18,446
podcasts now. All we need is 200 ratings and
we meet all of the criteria. So we've been

24
00:02:18,486 --> 00:02:22,428
trying to get there and we have been getting
ratings, but a few people have also been generous

25
00:02:22,468 --> 00:02:26,610
enough to give us reviews. So we just wanted
to give them a quick shout out. Yeah, we super

26
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:36,676
appreciate it. Thank you very much to Dnick290,
Badewalker, JazzPee, LilChef118, and LarryNuki.

27
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:40,578
I think that's how you pronounce that. Thanks
to all of you for your generosity. Yeah, you

28
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:47,943
guys say fantastic things. I don't deserve it,
but you don't deserve it. I do. Neither do

29
00:02:47,963 --> 00:02:53,588
you. Thanks again. Yeah, if you guys could help
us out with reaching 200 ratings on iTunes,

30
00:02:54,148 --> 00:02:59,573
please do so. And if you want to give a review
as well, that would be fantastic. So this Thursday

31
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:05,279
on Patreon, we will be releasing bonus content
for our patrons in the form of our secret project

32
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:08,562
that we've been working on for the past month
that the general public doesn't have access

33
00:03:08,582 --> 00:03:14,467
to yet. But it'll be like the second episode
of that. So patrons look forward to that this

34
00:03:14,507 --> 00:03:19,751
Thursday. If you want to join our Patreon, go
ahead and go to patreon.com slash dynamic duel.

35
00:03:20,271 --> 00:03:24,034
And for just two bucks a month, you get access
to weekly bonus content, which is awesome.

36
00:03:24,234 --> 00:03:28,897
So check that out for sure. One of our main
goals for the Patreon account is to reach 25

37
00:03:28,937 --> 00:03:33,240
patrons, at which point we will be printing
out physical copies of the dynamic duel no

38
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,563
prize that we award each week to a listener
that gives our favorite answer to the question

39
00:03:37,623 --> 00:03:43,618
of the week. And speaking of no prizes, it's
no prize time. So a No Prize is an award that

40
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:48,499
Marvel used to give out up until the 90s to
fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel No Prize,

41
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:53,741
is a digital award that we post on social media
that I personally draw for those who we feel

42
00:03:53,961 --> 00:03:59,122
gave the best answer to our question of the
week. Last week's question was, who would you

43
00:03:59,162 --> 00:04:03,303
have cast as Huntress and Black Canary? This
of course stemming from the news that those

44
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:08,385
two roles have been cast in Birds of Prey. Right.
So this was a tough one. Yeah, a lot of great

45
00:04:08,465 --> 00:04:12,867
answers, a lot of great half answers, I guess.
Yes. With almost every answer that we received,

46
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:18,470
I really, really liked one of those answers
and really kind of didn't really care for the

47
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,733
other one. Ultimately, I awarded the no prize
to two people who sort of gave my two favorite

48
00:04:24,153 --> 00:04:29,076
actresses for the individual roles. But yeah,
for Black Canary and for Huntress. Yeah, yeah,

49
00:04:29,456 --> 00:04:34,899
yeah. Honorable mention goes to Ariana Quadra
for her answer of Diane Kruger as Black Canary

50
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:40,827
and Rosario Dawson as Huntress, which was fantastic
choices. Like, I totally loved Diane Kruger

51
00:04:40,867 --> 00:04:46,373
ever since Troy. And Rosario Dawson? Total badass.
They may have been aged out of the parts by

52
00:04:46,413 --> 00:04:50,457
this point now, though. They're both in their
early 40s, late 30s, I think. Yeah, it'd be

53
00:04:50,477 --> 00:04:54,882
hard to carry a franchise with them. But yeah,
honorable mention also goes to Joel Seagrave,

54
00:04:54,902 --> 00:05:01,359
who gave the answer of Tatiana Maslany. She's
the orphan black actress for Black Canary and

55
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:05,442
Eliza Dushku as Huntress. Yeah, that was a great
answer. I can see both of those actresses in

56
00:05:05,482 --> 00:05:10,404
those roles. I can see Tatiana Maslany playing
Huntress as well as Black Canary. She could

57
00:05:10,424 --> 00:05:14,347
do so many roles. Yeah, I guess that's what
she's known for. Yeah, another honorable mention

58
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:20,770
goes to John and Adam Spies, who gave the answers
of Natalie Dormer as Black Canary and Marie

59
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,513
Evgaropoulos as Huntress. They actually gave
this answer in their own podcast, Blast From

60
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:29,832
Our Past podcast. which we guest starred on,
when they sent us their answer, they were like,

61
00:05:29,852 --> 00:05:34,916
just the podcast is our answer. So we put it
in this list. Yeah, that was a fun episode.

62
00:05:35,097 --> 00:05:39,901
In that episode, we talked about the Batman
animated series 90s cartoon show, as well as

63
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:43,684
the X-Men 90s cartoon show. So definitely check
that out if you get a chance, if you're a fan

64
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:47,407
of those shows, because their podcast is just
awesome. It's a great podcast. Again, it's

65
00:05:47,427 --> 00:05:51,871
called The Blast from Our Past Podcast. Yeah,
but to move on to the winners of the NOAH Prize,

66
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:58,008
we are giving it to Jacob Bell. who gave the
answer Blake Lively for Black Canary and Liv

67
00:05:58,048 --> 00:06:03,332
Tyler as Huntress. That's great right there.
It is. Blake Lively as Black Canary, that was

68
00:06:03,372 --> 00:06:08,456
always my dream cast. Liv Tyler is probably
a little bit too like- Well, she's like a decade

69
00:06:08,516 --> 00:06:16,203
older than Blake Lively. Yeah. And she's always
been very low energy, very soft spoken. I don't

70
00:06:16,223 --> 00:06:22,087
quite see her as being like the fierce Helena
Bertinelli from the comics. And then we're

71
00:06:22,127 --> 00:06:27,906
also giving the no prize to Mia Moraes. who
gave the answer Trisha Paytas as Black Canary.

72
00:06:28,066 --> 00:06:33,328
I don't know who that is. Which, but the answer
of Lily Collins as Huntress was fantastic.

73
00:06:33,848 --> 00:06:38,950
I love Lily Collins. She's great. She would
make a fantastic Huntress. Great answer. Yeah.

74
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,731
So yeah, congrats to Jacob Bell and Mia Marius.
You guys both get the Dynamic Duel No Prize

75
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:47,792
for this week. If you wanna win a Dynamic Duel
No Prize, go ahead and listen to later on this

76
00:06:47,832 --> 00:06:51,753
episode when we ask you guys another question
of the week. With that out of the way, onto

77
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:52,153
the news.

78
00:06:58,722 --> 00:07:04,523
So late last week Warner Brothers unveiled an
extended video. It's five minutes long of Aquaman

79
00:07:04,563 --> 00:07:08,945
footage. Yeah, that was crazy when I saw that.
I was like, wow, what's happening here? Yeah,

80
00:07:08,985 --> 00:07:15,506
this whole trailer literally, literally left
me with tears in my eyes. It's so beautiful.

81
00:07:15,667 --> 00:07:20,208
Oh my God. So fantastic. The action looks amazing.
That's the thing that blew me away. The action

82
00:07:20,328 --> 00:07:26,578
and just the cinematography is so bright, so
colorful, so amazing. These set pieces. I just

83
00:07:26,618 --> 00:07:30,620
want to go there. Right? Like I can't believe
someone imagined some of these places, some

84
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,462
of these like set designs. It's just phenomenal.
It's great. For both of these trailers for

85
00:07:35,603 --> 00:07:40,785
Aquaman, I just am blown away by how expensive
the movie feels. It feels huge. The production

86
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:47,269
value on this must've been astronomical. Like
a $300 movie. I mean, what? What? $300 million

87
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:53,752
movie. Seriously, seriously, so much money,
every frame. Yeah, it starts off with Jason

88
00:07:53,772 --> 00:08:00,557
Momoa, Arthur Curry, sort of like, talking about
his origin, I guess, his parents. It's interesting,

89
00:08:00,617 --> 00:08:05,381
the first shot is actually of a snow globe of
a lighthouse sitting on top of an H.P. Lovecraft

90
00:08:05,461 --> 00:08:10,706
book, which we know James Wan is a big horror
fan and H.P. Lovecraft deals with underwater

91
00:08:10,746 --> 00:08:14,849
monsters and stuff like that, so that was a
good call out. But we get to see, basically,

92
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:20,594
it's the love story between his mom, Queen Atlanta,
and his father, Tom Curry. they're in love,

93
00:08:20,614 --> 00:08:24,656
but she has to leave. And then, you know, we
see Aquaman, you know, grown up and he's lifting

94
00:08:24,736 --> 00:08:28,779
us up a submarine. But then the extended video
really gets into the meat of what it is. And

95
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:32,461
it's really like two action set pieces. I don't
even want to say action, because the first

96
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:36,843
one is, it's more like an Indiana Jones exploratory
kind of piece. They're in the desert. They

97
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:42,046
find these lost remains of Atlantis, which is
kind of cool. I'm guessing it's like one of

98
00:08:42,086 --> 00:08:45,548
the cities of Atlantis. And that's why the Atlanteans
don't live there anymore. Or like the city

99
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:49,691
moved at some point or something. Yeah, maybe,
I mean. Arthur Curry doesn't say that as they're

100
00:08:49,711 --> 00:08:53,014
walking up the sand dune. He's like, you know,
there's no way Atlantis was this far inland.

101
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:57,497
But yeah, just makes you wonder like what happened
to Atlantis? What happened to the city? It's

102
00:08:57,517 --> 00:09:03,142
a strange line. It's a strange scene. It looks
cool. It looks really, really cool, just like

103
00:09:03,182 --> 00:09:09,107
this ancient city. And even Jason Momoa can
help himself just being Jason Momoa. It's badass.

104
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:15,372
He's a little bombastic. He is. He is. It's
it's not in keeping with the character of Arthur

105
00:09:15,392 --> 00:09:21,780
Curry that I know from the comics. Yeah. Well,
what is that character? He's a little more

106
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,202
bland. He's a little more generic. He doesn't.
He's not bombastic. I wouldn't describe him

107
00:09:25,262 --> 00:09:30,525
as that. It's true. But in that regard, I think
that Jason Momoa is perhaps adding some depth

108
00:09:30,565 --> 00:09:35,908
to the character that didn't exist prior. You
look at characters like Iron Man, who prior

109
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:39,950
to the Iron Man movie was a little bit of the
same, you know, he wasn't defined through his

110
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,072
humor. Right. He wasn't like a smart ass. Right.
He was heavily defined as a character by his

111
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:49,651
alcoholism and a straightforward attitude. But
it wasn't until Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal,

112
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:54,613
which was at the time to me a little bit unfamiliar
in regards to the character, but it totally

113
00:09:54,633 --> 00:09:59,015
came to define Tony Stark going forward from
there, which I came to appreciate because it

114
00:09:59,055 --> 00:10:04,698
did add depth. Now we know Tony Stark as the
eccentric billionaire. Yeah, Jason Momoa definitely

115
00:10:04,758 --> 00:10:11,280
isn't selling a regal Aquaman. He's definitely
more of a guy who just grew up in the normal

116
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,988
world. So I don't... I don't mind it. Perhaps
drinks heavily or something, you know. Yeah,

117
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:20,830
he does. We know that from the Justice League
film. But it will be interesting if he does

118
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,513
eventually become closer to the Aquaman that
we all know and love from the comics towards

119
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:29,837
the end of the film, that will be his character
arc. To go from this guy who is the opposite

120
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:37,862
of royalty and go into a more mature character.
Yeah, yeah. In this scene, they activate this

121
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:42,005
Atlantean machine in kind of a funny way where
she takes a sweat and he's like, we could have

122
00:10:42,025 --> 00:10:46,139
just peed on it. I laughed at that. But it's,
you know, it's a good thing that her hand didn't

123
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:52,542
like move south lower and just like extract
the urine from his groin. There's probably

124
00:10:52,562 --> 00:10:56,664
a lot more there in his bladder. You probably
maybe, yeah. But the machine activates like

125
00:10:56,684 --> 00:11:00,985
a hologram and it's I think it's King Atlin,
the first King of Atlantis who actually sank

126
00:11:01,026 --> 00:11:06,048
Atlantis. And he's talking about his trident.
So now we know sort of like the story they're

127
00:11:06,068 --> 00:11:10,914
looking for this trident. And we haven't really
got that in previous trailers. Right. And they're

128
00:11:10,954 --> 00:11:16,257
trying to find it, I assume, before Orm can
find it. Right, yeah, I think so. But as he's

129
00:11:16,277 --> 00:11:21,640
talking about Atlantis, we get these really
great scenes just looking at ancient Atlantis

130
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,343
and underwater Atlantis. Yeah, it's amazing.
It almost looks like Asgard on steroids. Oh

131
00:11:27,403 --> 00:11:33,346
yeah. It's insane. It is insane. There's so
much detail, so much detail in every frame.

132
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:39,409
It's ridiculous. Once he starts talking about
the Trident and it has the power of Atlantis.

133
00:11:39,982 --> 00:11:44,223
Once that the hologram is done, she like breaks
the key. And then he's like, shouldn't we have

134
00:11:44,283 --> 00:11:48,085
at least written the message down? It was kind
of another funny scene. He's like, blah, blah.

135
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:52,847
Tried it. But then, you know, we get some more
like quick cuts of different scenes, but it

136
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:59,650
really leads into Black Manta and some like
Atlantean soldiers against Mara and Arthur.

137
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:06,073
Yeah. Which is pretty cool. Black Manta. Such
a badass. He looks so flippin cool. Yeah, I'm

138
00:12:06,113 --> 00:12:10,475
glad we pit him against Black Panther. I know,
I know. In our duel episode. It was such a

139
00:12:10,495 --> 00:12:14,857
good matchup. I'm really glad we did it. Arthur,
you know, he definitely seems to be holding

140
00:12:14,897 --> 00:12:19,579
his own, like, doing like this flip kick against
Black Manta, which was kind of cool. He's a

141
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:24,061
fighter. Yeah, definitely. Mera is on the run,
running across the rooftops as these soldiers

142
00:12:24,101 --> 00:12:28,563
are just like tearing straight through walls.
It's pretty cool. The camera work is pretty

143
00:12:28,603 --> 00:12:32,785
amazing. The camera work is the most impressive
thing about this action scene. I've never seen

144
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:36,946
camera work quite as kinetic as this. where
it's like darting through windows and stuff

145
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:41,308
like that and really tracking along with the
action in a way that's impossible to do physically,

146
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:46,890
but somehow they pull it off. It's movie making
magic. It is for sure, for sure. It's something

147
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:51,692
that you can't do in comics, right? Right. And
it just brings so much energy to the scene.

148
00:12:52,432 --> 00:12:57,038
But you know, that ends with one of the soldiers
getting shot on Mara. And then we get more

149
00:12:57,298 --> 00:13:01,981
action scenes throughout the rest of the video
of Oram and Arthur Curry fighting underwater.

150
00:13:02,061 --> 00:13:06,063
That looks really cool. That's gonna be a highlight
of the movie, I feel like. We also get a lot

151
00:13:06,103 --> 00:13:11,726
of the underwater battle scenes between the
sharks versus the alligators versus the seahorses

152
00:13:11,766 --> 00:13:15,108
and stuff like that. Yeah, and Nicole Kidman
being a badass with her trident. Yeah, I didn't

153
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,850
know she was gonna have an action scene in this
movie. No, I didn't know either. Looks like

154
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,732
she's protecting her family. Maybe they find
out that she's living with this family at some

155
00:13:21,772 --> 00:13:25,990
point. Yeah. And that's why she has to leave,
I'm guessing. Yeah. I think so. They definitely

156
00:13:26,030 --> 00:13:31,114
de-aged her for this. I'm wondering what role
she's going to serve later on in the film.

157
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:35,897
Not sure. But we get to see more of the trench
and more of that really, really cool scene

158
00:13:35,937 --> 00:13:41,141
of him like carrying a flare down into the water.
Those monsters look awesome. And then it ends

159
00:13:41,161 --> 00:13:46,305
with this pretty cool line of like Atlantis
has always had a king. Mer is talking to Arthur.

160
00:13:46,425 --> 00:13:50,848
This was a great moment. Yeah. And she's like,
we need something more. And Arthur's like,

161
00:13:50,868 --> 00:13:56,186
well, what's greater than a king? She's like
a hero. And then it's the coolest shot ever.

162
00:13:56,487 --> 00:14:00,028
It's well timed with the music and the moment.
It is super well timed. It's just like this

163
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:05,230
powerful cathartic moment of Aquaman just like
stepping out of this waterfall with the trident

164
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:10,692
in his classic costume, hair's all wet, just
pins his trident to the ground. So badass.

165
00:14:11,573 --> 00:14:16,215
Oh, so great. I'm wondering if the movie can
actually live up to this moment from the trailer,

166
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:21,937
because it's a lot of elements that work together
to create this magical moment. It will, it

167
00:14:22,217 --> 00:14:27,620
absolutely will. Okay. It will. I have so much
faith in James Wan. I can't wait for this film.

168
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,182
He should be commended for creating what looks
to be just a magical movie that presents a

169
00:14:32,282 --> 00:14:36,585
lot of things that we have never seen before
in film. In regards to the action, in regards

170
00:14:36,605 --> 00:14:40,847
to this world that he's creating, it looks on
par with something like Avatar. Oh yeah. It's

171
00:14:40,907 --> 00:14:46,630
awesome. I think out of all of its competition
for its opening weekend, it's going to come

172
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:52,793
out with the top spot. It's facing fierce competition
from Bumblebee, from Mary Poppins, from Sherlock.

173
00:14:53,218 --> 00:14:57,319
Homes and Watson. Homes and Watson, yeah. And
then that entitled Deadpool Christmas special

174
00:14:57,359 --> 00:15:01,561
thing. Right. Yeah. We're not exactly sure if
that's just a PG-13 of Deadpool 2 or not. I

175
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:06,223
mean, I'm beginning to think it's not going
to be just that. Right. That's probably the

176
00:15:06,263 --> 00:15:10,545
one I'm most concerned about. Uh huh. Um, this
all kind of brings us to our question of the

177
00:15:10,565 --> 00:15:10,745
week.

178
00:15:15,618 --> 00:15:20,840
So of the four other major films opening in
the same timeframe as Aquaman, including Bumblebee,

179
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:25,942
Mary Poppins, Holmes and Watson, and the untitled
Deadpool Christmas special, tell us why you

180
00:15:25,982 --> 00:15:32,084
think Aquaman has the best shot at winning the
weekend box office, or why not? Yeah, it's

181
00:15:32,144 --> 00:15:35,966
a little nerve wracking. It is. With all those
movies competing against each other. They're

182
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:40,388
just gonna consume each other, and I hope that
Aquaman's box office doesn't suffer as a result.

183
00:15:40,968 --> 00:15:46,278
Again, I do think it'll win the weekend, but
if it doesn't, I'm kind of curious which one

184
00:15:46,298 --> 00:15:53,362
will take it over. Does this trailer make you
nervous for Deadpool? No, I don't care if Deadpool

185
00:15:53,382 --> 00:15:57,844
makes money or not because we already have Deadpool
2. So it's kind of more like a joke Christmas

186
00:15:57,884 --> 00:16:03,207
special kind of thing, I think. So I don't think
it was made necessarily to make money but more

187
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:09,290
to facilitate the brand of Deadpool. I wish
they weren't doing it, I hate them. But yeah,

188
00:16:09,331 --> 00:16:15,762
post your answer to our Instagram, Twitter,
Facebook, or email us at dyna and we will pick

189
00:16:15,802 --> 00:16:20,684
our favorite answer and draw that person a dynamic
dual no prize that we'll post to social media.

190
00:16:21,924 --> 00:16:26,626
Moving on from Aquaman into Spider-Man, we got
the official second trailer for Spider-Man

191
00:16:26,726 --> 00:16:31,748
into the Spider-Verse. And I think this is the
best trailer for this movie by far. They've

192
00:16:31,828 --> 00:16:37,511
all been really impressive. But this one was
a great way to sell the movie to general audiences

193
00:16:37,811 --> 00:16:42,233
who weren't still quite clear on what the concept
is. Because it's Peter Parker that introduces

194
00:16:42,273 --> 00:16:47,311
the film and he kind of gives us narration.
and you get short clips of animated scenes

195
00:16:47,651 --> 00:16:50,993
that resemble the Sam Raimi films where he's
talking about like, you know who I am, I've

196
00:16:51,033 --> 00:16:56,056
saved the world, you know, and we see him stopping
the train from Spider-Man 2 and just like the

197
00:16:56,076 --> 00:17:01,579
car through the window. Yeah, it's very familiar
and I think that's a great lead in to what

198
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:06,722
is going to be a more unfamiliar universe for
most moviegoers. It seems kind of like a Deadpool

199
00:17:06,762 --> 00:17:11,185
version of Spider-Man and that like he's self-aware.
He knows he's a comic book, you know, like

200
00:17:11,225 --> 00:17:16,700
he did a Christmas album. Yeah, and the comic
book and he has a cereal and a so-so popsicle.

201
00:17:17,121 --> 00:17:21,024
That was hilarious because I've had that popsicle
and that's the one with like the gum eyes that

202
00:17:21,044 --> 00:17:25,207
are on it. They have other Marvel versions of
it, but yeah, that was a shitty looking popsicle.

203
00:17:25,987 --> 00:17:29,970
It looked like it was photographed on like a
plastic plate or something. It's funny. But

204
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:34,914
yeah, it transitions from there into the Miles
Morales Ultimate Universe and we get a rehash

205
00:17:34,974 --> 00:17:39,497
of the scene where he tells his dad, I love
you, which pays off later on in this trailer

206
00:17:39,637 --> 00:17:43,771
where He tells his dad he loves him again while
in the Spider-Man costume. Right, and the dad's

207
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:49,692
like, what? Wait, what? It looks like the Kingpin
and some other supervillains are trying to

208
00:17:49,812 --> 00:17:55,294
open a dimensional gateway, and that's what
brings Spider-Man through to this world. So

209
00:17:55,314 --> 00:18:00,295
that was the Kingpin. Yes. And it's voiced by
Leif Schreiber. Oh, that's cool. Yeah. It's

210
00:18:00,315 --> 00:18:03,676
a pretty good Kingpin voice, I think. I like
the character design on all these guys, but

211
00:18:03,736 --> 00:18:09,142
he looks particularly menacing here. But Kingpin
does. He does. He does. And so Spider-Man comes

212
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:13,785
into the Ultimate Universe and basically tells
Miles, like, I'm from this normal universe

213
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:18,829
and you're from this like weird dinky universe
using french fries as metaphors. But he trains

214
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:25,473
Miles on how to be Spider-Man. And in the process,
we introduced to all these other characters

215
00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:29,516
that are going to be in the movie. They're pretty
cool at the introductions. Yeah, I like the

216
00:18:29,536 --> 00:18:33,139
introductions. Gwen Stacy with like the drums,
I was like, yeah, it was like really getting

217
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:38,070
into the trailer. Yeah, we've seen her in those
Aspen trees before, but yeah, like. Her universe

218
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:42,451
is very pink. She's a musician in her universe.
She plays the drums. She's in a band. This

219
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:46,232
is the universe where Gwen Stacy was bit by
the radioactive spider instead of Peter Parker.

220
00:18:46,752 --> 00:18:52,014
We also get introductions to Spider-Man War
voiced by Nick Cage. It's a really quick introduction.

221
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:56,355
Yeah, it's a really quick introduction. It looks
pretty cool though. And we also see Spider

222
00:18:56,815 --> 00:19:02,157
who is Penny Parker who controls the spider
robot. So that's pretty cool. I wasn't expecting

223
00:19:02,197 --> 00:19:06,178
to see her, but her art style, the art style
in each of these characters. is pretty spot

224
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:10,322
on for the universe that they come from. Yeah.
Like Penny Parker, she looks like an anime

225
00:19:10,342 --> 00:19:16,426
character. Right, right. And Peter Parker looks
like a Looney Tunes character. He looks almost

226
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:21,070
exactly like Porky Pig. And John Mulaney's voice
is just fantastic. It's fantastic, it's great,

227
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,453
yeah. I like how Peter Parker's like, this can't
get any weirder. And he's like, it can get

228
00:19:24,493 --> 00:19:29,697
weirder. I have no idea why his hand is wet
though, or his body is wet. Right. After that

229
00:19:29,737 --> 00:19:33,871
we get... Just kinda like quick flashes about
what the rest of the movie is about. It looks

230
00:19:33,891 --> 00:19:38,754
like Kingpin is teaming up with enemies like
Tombstone and the Scorpion to fight the Spider-Man.

231
00:19:38,794 --> 00:19:44,417
It's a different take on Scorpion. Is that like
the ultimate version? Yeah, it is. Green Goblin's

232
00:19:44,457 --> 00:19:48,599
in it too and it's the ultimate version of him
as well. We see Prowler as well, I think. Yeah,

233
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:53,241
Prowler. All great designs, I think. I still
just love the animation of this whole thing.

234
00:19:53,561 --> 00:19:57,883
Is it like a little... choppy again so it looks
like almost like it's stop motion or something

235
00:19:57,903 --> 00:20:02,366
like that. Yeah, lower frame rate. Right, exactly.
It brings a lot of charm to it. Yeah, definitely.

236
00:20:02,726 --> 00:20:08,309
The last thing is Miles and Peter and Spider-Man
Noir and Peter Porker and all those guys, they're

237
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:13,352
I guess hiding in Miles' room where Gonky is,
or Gonk, I don't know how to pronounce his

238
00:20:13,392 --> 00:20:18,034
name, but it's his best friend and he's reading
a Spider-Man comic book it looks like and they're

239
00:20:18,054 --> 00:20:24,838
trying to remain hidden by sticking to the walls
as like a singular spider. Right. Spider-Hem

240
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:29,083
blows the cover by saying, do animals talk in
this universe? Cause I don't want to freak

241
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:33,808
him out. That was hilarious. It was pretty good.
I really liked that joke. And all, every time

242
00:20:33,848 --> 00:20:37,812
I see new marketing for this movie, I get more
and more excited for it. Especially that final

243
00:20:37,832 --> 00:20:43,738
shot where like Miles Morales takes that opening
scene and really makes it his own. Where Peter

244
00:20:43,778 --> 00:20:48,754
Parker was standing on that gargoyle looking
over New York City. This time it's Miles Morales

245
00:20:48,774 --> 00:20:52,476
and he kind of stamps his own mark on it. Yeah,
he's literally putting his own mark on it.

246
00:20:52,676 --> 00:20:56,197
Yeah, it's- I mean, it's vandalism, but it's
still badass. It's a bumper sticker. No one's-

247
00:20:56,677 --> 00:21:00,559
who's gonna complain? No one's gonna see it.
I've been more excited for this than like any

248
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:04,541
other Marvel movie, I think, in a really long
time. Really? Yeah, I don't know why. Just

249
00:21:04,581 --> 00:21:09,763
because of its artistic style? I think so. Yeah,
it's really cool. It's certainly more styled

250
00:21:09,783 --> 00:21:13,724
than other animated Marvel and DC films that
have come out recently, such as like Lego Batman.

251
00:21:13,824 --> 00:21:19,627
Oh, yeah. Or Teen Titans Go or something like
that. Yeah. So in other news, Rosie Perez has

252
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:26,731
been cast as Renee Montoya in the Birds of Prey
film, which in one sense is kind of perfect

253
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:33,535
casting. She's a little bit older. She is. That's
the other sense. It was a definite surprise

254
00:21:33,555 --> 00:21:39,839
to me. I thought they would go for someone younger,
for someone who, you know, could carry a franchise

255
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:45,746
for many years to come. Right. Well, in the
comics, the question is... Victor Sage and

256
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:50,468
he is the mentor to Renee Montoya who comes
the second question. So it looks like in this

257
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:55,450
Birds of Prey movie, they're kind of swapping
that in that it seems like Renee Montoya is

258
00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:00,212
going to be the mentor character to perhaps
some of these younger super heroines. I don't

259
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:06,335
know honestly, if that's the case. She may just
be a cop. She may just be a Gotham city police

260
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:10,957
officer, which I could totally see her selling,
you know? Oh, so you don't think we'll see

261
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:17,258
her as the question? I'm starting to have doubts
because of this casting. If it was a younger

262
00:22:17,298 --> 00:22:22,142
casting, I think maybe you would have, you know,
like a pretty solid journey from her being

263
00:22:22,182 --> 00:22:28,627
a detective to being the question. But I think
this may be a smaller role than I initially

264
00:22:28,707 --> 00:22:35,013
thought. OK. Yeah. Because, you know, they need
some kind of face for the police force in Gotham

265
00:22:35,073 --> 00:22:39,937
City in general. So why not have it be Renee
Montoya? That makes the question may not factor

266
00:22:39,977 --> 00:22:44,624
into this at all. Which is kind of a shame.
I do like the character of the question. Yeah.

267
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:50,770
I mean, it still leaves room for Victor Sage
to be the question, but it kind of maybe puts

268
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:55,714
the character of René Montoya in a position
in the cinematic realm, at least of never being,

269
00:22:56,135 --> 00:23:00,422
never being the question. Yeah. It leaves both
options open-ended. Yeah. Yeah, it does. You

270
00:23:00,442 --> 00:23:03,923
know, I remember her from films like Do the
Right Thing, White Men Can't Jump. I don't

271
00:23:03,943 --> 00:23:06,845
think I ever saw that full movie. She was in
Planetable Express. It was the last thing I

272
00:23:06,865 --> 00:23:10,446
saw. She was. Yeah. She was a cop in that, wasn't
she? Yeah, she was. Yeah. Maybe that's what

273
00:23:10,466 --> 00:23:15,148
I'm thinking. She's going to be a pretty badass
detective. But yeah, again, it was it was just

274
00:23:15,468 --> 00:23:20,050
a big surprise to me. I wasn't quite sure how
I felt about it initially, but quite the diverse

275
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:25,273
cast that they have going here now. Yeah, for
sure. For sure. She's of course joining Journey

276
00:23:25,313 --> 00:23:30,483
Smollett Bell and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. and
Margot Robbie in the film. We don't know who

277
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:34,866
is going to play Black Mask yet. And we don't
know who's going to play Cassandra Cain yet.

278
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:39,189
That'll be interesting. Yeah. Yeah, definitely.
I'm looking forward to seeing what else they

279
00:23:39,229 --> 00:23:46,415
could do with this. I don't have 100% confidence
in the project yet, I would say. But, you know,

280
00:23:46,435 --> 00:23:50,758
I'm just waiting for more information. We have
rumors of what the story is going to be. And

281
00:23:50,778 --> 00:23:55,341
that sounds like a bad-ass story. Right. But
hopefully Cathy Young can pull it off, the

282
00:23:55,381 --> 00:24:01,207
director. Right, right. Alright, moving on to
the first trailers for Daredevil Season 3.

283
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:05,710
They're a little bit late coming considering
that the third season actually debuts in just

284
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:11,292
like a week actually. Right. Yeah. But I think
that's why they gave us two right away. We

285
00:24:11,312 --> 00:24:17,395
got two Daredevil Season 3 trailers. The first
one is more about Matt Murdock and we see him

286
00:24:17,575 --> 00:24:21,937
kind of out from under the rubble that he was
stuck under from the Defenders television show.

287
00:24:22,037 --> 00:24:25,544
Yeah. Can you believe that it's actually been
that long since we've had a Daredevil season?

288
00:24:25,724 --> 00:24:30,287
Yeah, since like last year. Since season two,
no, two years ago. What? Since season two,

289
00:24:30,307 --> 00:24:35,570
we've had two seasons of Luke Cage, two Iron
Fist seasons, a Defenders and a Jessica Jones.

290
00:24:35,771 --> 00:24:40,374
That's true. Yeah, it's been a while. But it's
good to have him back, especially with the

291
00:24:40,414 --> 00:24:45,877
Kingpin back. Heck yeah. In this trailer, we
see that Kingpin strikes a deal and he's able

292
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:50,981
to get released on parole, it looks like, from
prison. And he's out to seek revenge against

293
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:56,149
Matt Murdock and just... make his life a living
hell. So it seems to be at least partially

294
00:24:56,469 --> 00:25:01,073
adapting the Born Again storyline in which the
Kingpin knows Daredevil's secret identity and

295
00:25:01,093 --> 00:25:05,497
you can listen to more about that in our Daredevil
versus Nightwing dual episode that we did a

296
00:25:05,517 --> 00:25:10,041
few months ago. And I'm not missing anything
right? Like Kingpin doesn't currently know

297
00:25:10,101 --> 00:25:14,544
Matt Murdock's identity. Like he'll learn it
in this season. Well at the end of Daredevil

298
00:25:14,564 --> 00:25:19,849
season two it seemed like he was this close
to figuring it all out. He was following a

299
00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:24,269
paper trail. that would have revealed that Matt
Murdock was Daredevil. Cause that was his kind

300
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:28,393
of project while he was in prison, just passing
time, was trying to figure out who this guy

301
00:25:28,473 --> 00:25:33,519
is. The action looks spectacular in this trailer.
It looks like we have another hallway fight

302
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:37,623
this time that takes place in the prison. And
I heard that it's just amazing from people

303
00:25:37,643 --> 00:25:42,448
who have seen the first few episodes of the
show so far. Both trailers are really intense.

304
00:25:42,788 --> 00:25:47,851
Yeah, they are. Really intense. Matt's back
to wearing his black outfit from the initial

305
00:25:47,891 --> 00:25:52,074
season one. I think the reason he's wearing
the black costume is because as we see at the

306
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:56,717
end of this trailer, there's a new guy who's
wearing the Daredevil costume and he's being

307
00:25:56,757 --> 00:26:01,560
a villain basically. So I think in order to
distinguish himself from that evil Daredevil,

308
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:06,102
Matt has taken on his old costume so that he
doesn't get confused by the authorities or

309
00:26:06,122 --> 00:26:09,644
from other people. I don't know if that's the
case because he's wearing his black costume

310
00:26:09,664 --> 00:26:15,115
before he even meets the new Daredevil. But
we don't necessarily know the chronology of

311
00:26:15,155 --> 00:26:19,737
events here. It could be that this new Daredevil
has been Daredevil for quite some time at this

312
00:26:19,777 --> 00:26:25,560
point. True, maybe. So it is cool though, I
mean, they're heavily implying that this new

313
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,582
Daredevil is Bullseye, just the way he's throwing
things and how accurate he is at throwing and

314
00:26:30,762 --> 00:26:34,423
marksmanship and stuff like that. And he has
a gun at the very end of the trailer. It's

315
00:26:34,443 --> 00:26:38,765
kind of like a callback to like the famous Daredevil
comic book cover where he's like pointing a

316
00:26:38,825 --> 00:26:43,455
gun. Oh, right. Yeah. It was like no more Mr.
Nice Guy or something like that. Something

317
00:26:43,475 --> 00:26:48,117
like that. Yeah. Part of Frank Miller's run.
It is very reminiscent of that. And Wilson

318
00:26:48,257 --> 00:26:53,339
Bethel looks pretty cool in the mask, I think.
At one point, he was in the running to play

319
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:57,181
Captain America. He was like in the top three
contenders to play Captain America. Oh, really?

320
00:26:57,301 --> 00:27:02,403
Oh, I'm still glad that Chris Evans got the
role because he's just he's just perfect as

321
00:27:02,443 --> 00:27:07,685
Cap. It's nice to also see that Wilson Bethel
still got a chance to play in the Marvel universe.

322
00:27:07,765 --> 00:27:11,563
Yeah. because he seems like a pretty badass
actor, especially in the next trailer that

323
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:16,746
we get, where we get to see more regarding the
character of who they're calling Agent Poindexter.

324
00:27:17,147 --> 00:27:22,470
This is Bullseye, right? It is. I don't remember
his name being Poindexter in our Bullseye vs.

325
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:27,152
Deadshot episode. Yeah, his name was Lester.
Yeah. They've never really revealed his name,

326
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:31,115
so I'm wondering if the show is kind of taking
liberty with that, or they're actually giving

327
00:27:31,155 --> 00:27:34,817
him a name. I guess there's enough mystery around
the character where they can do something like

328
00:27:34,857 --> 00:27:40,571
that successfully. Right. Like maybe his name
is Lester Poindexter or Dexter Lester or something

329
00:27:40,591 --> 00:27:45,033
like that. That'd be a weird name. But yeah.
And, and the end, it could turn out to all

330
00:27:45,053 --> 00:27:50,355
be an alias or something like that. So one never
knows, but Kingpin is impressed with his skills

331
00:27:50,676 --> 00:27:57,118
as a corrupt FBI agent and hires him essentially
to impersonate Daredevil. Yeah. The guy looks

332
00:27:57,178 --> 00:28:02,780
intense. Uh, he has a very intense look to him.
His, his bone structure is like freaking gaunt

333
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:07,519
as hell. Those are some sharp features, but
his voice is pretty spot on into what I would

334
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:12,582
imagine Bullseye's voice would be as well. And
just the things that he does where he's like

335
00:28:12,963 --> 00:28:17,666
shooting guys from far distances, nailing him
with the headshot and you know throwing knives

336
00:28:17,706 --> 00:28:21,969
into chest and stuff like that. He looks pretty
badass. Bullseye is pretty unstable. He's always

337
00:28:22,029 --> 00:28:27,353
been like a scary kind of villain. And that
he's just like unpredictable and just so darn...

338
00:28:27,513 --> 00:28:32,636
Talented. Efficient and talented. Yeah. I'm
excited for this season. I like one of the

339
00:28:32,656 --> 00:28:36,547
later shots where it looks like... Bullseye
is about to kill a guy by throwing a billy

340
00:28:36,567 --> 00:28:41,069
club through his head and at the very last moment
Matt Murdock is able to catch it right before

341
00:28:41,089 --> 00:28:45,011
it hits the guy's face. Yeah, that was pretty
cool. Yeah So really looking forward to this

342
00:28:45,031 --> 00:28:50,214
season. I don't have to wait long for it. Thank
goodness comes out October 19th So yeah, we'll

343
00:28:50,234 --> 00:28:53,636
definitely have the review up by the end of
this month when we binge all those episodes

344
00:28:53,856 --> 00:28:59,679
Yeah, yeah, it's coming up soon moving on to
DC television We got our final trailer the

345
00:28:59,719 --> 00:29:05,786
official team up trailer for Titans which comes
out also this month I think next week actually.

346
00:29:05,806 --> 00:29:11,167
Oh really? Yeah, yeah. This debuted at New York
Comic Con. It's not a long trailer. It's less

347
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:14,649
than two minutes long. It's my favorite trailer
so far that they've released. It's because

348
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:19,370
of the song, isn't it? It's not just because
of that cool cover song by Marilyn Manson of

349
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:22,991
Cry Little Sister. It was the Lost Boys song.
Yeah, the song from the Lost Boys movie. It's

350
00:29:23,031 --> 00:29:27,272
such a great cover and it fits so well with
the visuals that we're seeing on the trailer.

351
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:33,399
Yeah. But it also does a great job with showcasing
each. Superheroes powers. I think in a way

352
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:37,522
that the previous trailers didn't they feel
more like their respective characters in this

353
00:29:37,562 --> 00:29:42,607
than they have at any Previous point in the
marketing. Yeah, this probably is also my favorite

354
00:29:42,627 --> 00:29:47,571
trailer better than like last week's Netflix
trailer It makes me want to be Robin and have

355
00:29:47,591 --> 00:29:52,334
a collapsible bow staff that I can use to just
like point outward and then like have it Extend

356
00:29:52,455 --> 00:29:56,358
and hit two guys on the sides of me. It's just
so cool They are totally selling Robin like

357
00:29:56,518 --> 00:30:01,886
in a way that no live-action Robin. I mean,
there's only been one I guess Yeah Yeah, he's

358
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:06,008
such a badass in this. He looks like he's a
badass. Even Beast Boy is impressed. He's like,

359
00:30:06,068 --> 00:30:10,891
it's Robin. Yeah, yeah. His reaction was my
reaction. Yeah, it was a great moment. But,

360
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:15,634
you know, it sets up the story. It's definitely
like a Rosemary's baby kind of thing. Raven's

361
00:30:15,674 --> 00:30:21,097
the daughter of Trigon and, you know, this cult
is trying to bring him back through her. Right.

362
00:30:21,777 --> 00:30:25,920
We can see her use her powers in this too. She
kind of like extends her soul self out of her

363
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,394
body. Yeah. Attacks on people with it. It doesn't
look. quite like I thought it would. It doesn't

364
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:35,457
look like a raven or anything. It looks like
a swarm of ravens. Yeah, they kind of form

365
00:30:35,477 --> 00:30:39,559
like a tentacle kind of thing. Yeah, yeah, I
don't know if I'm the biggest fan. You know,

366
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,641
this has been getting good reviews, but they're
also saying like, it's not really the Titans

367
00:30:44,661 --> 00:30:50,784
that people know. They're saying the acting
is really good and the story grows on you for

368
00:30:50,824 --> 00:30:56,107
sure. So I'm glad that it's getting good reviews
because. These trailers don't inspire the highest

369
00:30:56,147 --> 00:31:01,031
degree of confidence when it comes to faithful
interpretations of the characters Uh-huh, but

370
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:05,975
I'm still definitely gonna watch it for sure.
We see Beast Boy turn into a tiger We see Starfire

371
00:31:05,995 --> 00:31:11,480
shoot her fire out Yeah Beast Boy like his introduction
is like Raven stumbling in on him when he's

372
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:16,123
like all bloody at the mouth and stuff like
that It's like the cult has him maybe trapped

373
00:31:16,163 --> 00:31:21,488
in the same place that she's trapped in I don't
know and she rescues him and then it also looks

374
00:31:21,508 --> 00:31:26,772
like Starfire rescues Raven as well Yeah, and
then they meet Robin and he's just being a

375
00:31:26,812 --> 00:31:31,595
badass taking fools out in the dark and shadow
just being really cool What do you think of

376
00:31:31,635 --> 00:31:36,838
the news that we heard that the reason that
robin is like branching away from batman in

377
00:31:36,878 --> 00:31:42,582
this series is Because he disagrees with batman's
methodology in that he kills people in this

378
00:31:42,642 --> 00:31:48,326
universe Do you think that's true? Do you think
it's been misinterpreted? I don't know I wouldn't

379
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:52,909
be surprised if that's the case judging on how
dark this is. Uh-huh. I'm not happy about it

380
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:56,959
But I don't know, it doesn't seem like Batman
will be that big of a character in this show.

381
00:31:57,199 --> 00:32:03,223
So, I don't know. Hopefully they don't. Wait,
fuck it up DC. I know. If they did that. If

382
00:32:03,243 --> 00:32:06,765
they did that. Apparently they didn't fuck it
up though, because I keep hearing good things

383
00:32:06,805 --> 00:32:10,887
about it. There's some fascinating things in
this trailer, like this guy just covered in

384
00:32:10,947 --> 00:32:15,750
blood and like the cult people like blinking
lights in their head. It's pretty crazy. It

385
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:19,632
looks pretty crazy. And of course we get that
Avengers team up shot at the end where all

386
00:32:19,752 --> 00:32:24,750
of them are in frame and like, you know, Beast
Boy is a tiger and... Raven is in her white

387
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:30,193
form. Yeah. I'm looking forward to next week
just to get a taste of it. Yeah Too bad. It

388
00:32:30,213 --> 00:32:34,956
doesn't all come out at one time. We did get
the release schedule for the DC Universe shows

389
00:32:35,056 --> 00:32:38,858
Yes. Yep, and it looks like we're actually getting
Doom Patrol earlier than we thought we would.

390
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:44,121
Yeah, it's coming out next year Brendan Fraser
was on stage and he made a goof. He was like,

391
00:32:44,161 --> 00:32:48,423
oh, yeah, it's coming out mid-december. That's
that's not the case That's when Young Justice

392
00:32:48,443 --> 00:32:54,086
comes out. Yes. Yeah, and then Doom Patrol comes
after that, right? Another one of the shows

393
00:32:54,266 --> 00:33:00,489
for DC Universe that we got a sneak peek at
was Harley Quinn. That's coming out next December.

394
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:04,310
Right, like more than a year from now. That's
insane. I'm surprised they gave us our first

395
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:10,333
look so early. But along with the first look
came the news that Kelly Cuoco of The Big Bang

396
00:33:10,353 --> 00:33:15,595
Theory is voicing Harley Quinn. Now when I first
saw the sneak peek, which starts off in Arkham

397
00:33:15,615 --> 00:33:21,057
Asylum, actually it stays there. It's just her
talking to the camera in her prison cell with

398
00:33:21,097 --> 00:33:25,880
Poison Ivy. Yeah, breaking the fourth wall.
Yeah, I went to the audience. I wasn't exactly

399
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:32,203
thrilled with the voice initially until like,
I don't know, halfway through when she's talking

400
00:33:32,223 --> 00:33:37,026
about extremely gratuitous violence. Then I'm
like, this is a pretty good voice to me. She

401
00:33:37,046 --> 00:33:43,430
sold me on you're going to piss yourself. It
is a funny trailer. I watched it like 50 times

402
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:47,832
that I was just laughing every time. And my
wife was like, what are you watching? So I

403
00:33:47,852 --> 00:33:53,207
had to show her. But yeah, I like the animation
style. I like the humor, I like the voice work,

404
00:33:53,888 --> 00:34:01,573
Lake Bell as Poison Ivy is fantastic. And then
we even get a Batman cameo. And a dig at Deadpool.

405
00:34:02,014 --> 00:34:07,497
Nice Marvel dig right in there. Ugh. Yeah, I
hated that. Because as we all know, Deadpool

406
00:34:07,537 --> 00:34:12,181
was to get an animated series as well, and it
was supposed to be produced, and I think starring

407
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:17,925
Donald Glover as Wade Wilson, and it fell through
the cracks due to creative differences, allegedly.

408
00:34:18,085 --> 00:34:23,904
Right. But... Yeah, this looks good. I think
I do like Kaley Cuoco's voice It's surprising

409
00:34:23,944 --> 00:34:29,687
because her big bang theory cast mates Melissa
Rush I think is how you pronounce her name.

410
00:34:30,108 --> 00:34:36,451
She was also Harley Quinn Yeah, in the Harley
and Batman movie that came out earlier this

411
00:34:36,511 --> 00:34:41,114
year. I think yeah, yeah I didn't see the film.
I saw the trailer though. Honestly. I didn't

412
00:34:41,154 --> 00:34:45,176
really care for the voice. I like this one much
more Yeah, I wonder if they were competing

413
00:34:45,236 --> 00:34:49,270
for this role of Harley Quinn in this television
show I wouldn't be surprised, you know, along

414
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:54,153
with Tara Strong and probably all the other
voices wanted this role. But I'm kind of glad

415
00:34:54,173 --> 00:34:58,495
it went to Kelly Cuoco because she does have
some nerd cred, some geek cred in there. A

416
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:02,237
little bit. The cast, honestly, for this show,
I don't know if you've seen the cast list,

417
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:07,720
it's fantastic. Really? It has, you know, Lake
Bell has Jason Alexander from Seinfeld. It's

418
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,582
just so many voices. It's gonna be great. We
don't know who everyone is gonna play yet.

419
00:35:11,602 --> 00:35:16,705
Uh. But the cast is phenomenal. And now we just
have to wait a year to see it. A whole freaking

420
00:35:16,745 --> 00:35:22,478
year. Yay. I guess they also give a dig to DC
as well when they're talking about like, shouldn't

421
00:35:22,498 --> 00:35:27,482
it be like dark and bleak and depressing like
other DC stuff? Yeah. I just love Harley's

422
00:35:27,522 --> 00:35:31,506
reaction. She's like, that is a wonderful way
to make movies and television shows, but not

423
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:36,390
my show. Just it's, there's so many like very
diplomatic kind of answer. There's a great

424
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:41,002
energy to Kelly Cuoco's voice. And you know,
she could hit the highs and she hits like more

425
00:35:41,042 --> 00:35:45,787
serious notes. More serious notes. She does
a great job. Yeah. And like the logo is great

426
00:35:45,847 --> 00:35:50,031
and she comments on that and they're like, ooh,
this logo. Yeah. Poison Ivy is like, they're

427
00:35:50,051 --> 00:35:54,556
going to hate it. It's very Suicide Squad, that
logo, you know, very like neon blue and pink.

428
00:35:54,656 --> 00:36:00,242
Yeah, it is. It is. Yeah. But I think that brings
us to the end of the news. Let's go ahead and

429
00:36:00,462 --> 00:36:03,425
get into our review of the Venom film. Let's
do it.

430
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:23,714
Alright, so Venom, quite the polarizing movie
I've found. I think we're gonna have listeners

431
00:36:23,994 --> 00:36:27,216
who are gonna hate this movie, I think we're
gonna have listeners that absolutely love this

432
00:36:27,256 --> 00:36:32,640
movie, so what I don't want to have happen is
you guys hate us for thinking that the movie

433
00:36:32,681 --> 00:36:37,624
was, you know, mostly good. Is there anyone
who really loves this movie though? Oh yeah,

434
00:36:37,644 --> 00:36:41,948
oh yeah. Really? Yeah, there are people out
there who really love this movie. Because,

435
00:36:41,988 --> 00:36:47,235
you know, it does have a lot going for it. You
know, despite everything that we say regarding

436
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:52,997
the movie's flaws, which there are a lot, and
we'll get into that, Venom surpasses a lot

437
00:36:53,017 --> 00:36:57,659
of that negativity through what it does really
well, and that is, you know, the relationship

438
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:03,602
between Venom and Eddie, and the characterization
of Venom. I thought the film absolutely nailed

439
00:37:03,882 --> 00:37:08,744
the Venom character, especially in regards to
the action, which, you know, is the primary

440
00:37:08,764 --> 00:37:13,678
appeal of any superhero movie. As moviegoers
and comic fans, we want to see these characters'

441
00:37:13,718 --> 00:37:18,622
personalities depicted accurately, and marvel
at the spectacle of their powers. And I think

442
00:37:18,702 --> 00:37:24,307
in that regard, I think this movie succeeded.
And just a forewarning to those who haven't

443
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:29,211
seen the film, this is gonna be a spoiler review.
So if you haven't seen the film yet, go ahead

444
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:34,375
and turn the podcast off now. Don't listen to
the review. Maybe go see the film if you want

445
00:37:34,415 --> 00:37:38,418
to, if you don't want to. I think I would recommend
it. I would totally recommend it. Go see it.

446
00:37:38,498 --> 00:37:42,041
What are you doing? If you don't want to, what
are you doing? Yeah, don't listen to what everyone

447
00:37:42,061 --> 00:37:46,408
else is saying. Go see it for yourself, because
you might enjoy it. The reaction that I get

448
00:37:46,628 --> 00:37:51,092
most often that I've heard is a lot better than
I thought it was meant to be. Yeah, for sure.

449
00:37:51,152 --> 00:37:55,116
I think almost everybody I talked to has said
that. So whatever you're thinking it's gonna

450
00:37:55,136 --> 00:37:58,939
be if you haven't seen it, it's gonna be better
than that. Was it just the Lady Gaga fans who

451
00:37:58,959 --> 00:38:01,801
were like telling everyone it was just gonna
be like the worst piece of shit ever? No, there

452
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:06,525
were legit reviewers who were coming down on
this movie pretty hard, and you know, overall,

453
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:10,368
the film got like a 30% on Rotten Tomatoes,
which is much lower than what it should have

454
00:38:10,389 --> 00:38:16,255
gotten. Yeah, I agree. But as you know, sometimes
popular culture goes to a movie with somewhat

455
00:38:16,275 --> 00:38:20,896
of an agenda. I think a lot of people were turned
off by the trailers for this film and therefore

456
00:38:20,936 --> 00:38:26,018
kind of wanted to see it fail. Maybe also because
it wasn't part of the Spider-Man universe.

457
00:38:26,078 --> 00:38:31,439
It has nothing to do with Spider-Man. So there
are reasons for people to wanna see this movie

458
00:38:31,479 --> 00:38:37,101
not do well, but it has been doing well. It
broke box office records, made over 80 million,

459
00:38:37,541 --> 00:38:42,503
I think, if the numbers came in correctly. and
it was like over 200 million worldwide, I believe,

460
00:38:42,523 --> 00:38:45,744
like 213 or something. Oh, definitely. I mean,
it did better than Ant-Man and the Wasp. It's

461
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:49,966
going to get a sequel. And I think the best
thing that could be said about this film is

462
00:38:50,006 --> 00:38:54,428
that knowing that it's gonna get a sequel now,
I'm super excited for that. Yeah, it's a good

463
00:38:54,468 --> 00:38:57,930
starting point. It's a good launching pad. For
the franchise. Yeah, yeah, definitely. What

464
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:02,372
did you think of the action and the spectacle?
I don't know if I would agree that the action

465
00:39:02,572 --> 00:39:08,062
was that great. To me, it's just like one step
above Transformers. Like the two big action

466
00:39:08,102 --> 00:39:12,225
scenes, like the one in the lobby, you know,
it was full of smoke. It was kind of hard to

467
00:39:12,265 --> 00:39:17,269
see what was going on. And then the other one,
you know, the final fight, Venom and Riot looked

468
00:39:17,409 --> 00:39:22,733
so similar. And I was afraid this was going
to happen in the trailers, but, you know, it's

469
00:39:22,753 --> 00:39:29,078
just so much CG. It just makes my eyes bleed.
That being said, like it was passable. It wasn't

470
00:39:29,098 --> 00:39:33,581
the worst action I've ever seen. It was just
passable. I would have to disagree in that

471
00:39:33,841 --> 00:39:38,741
I... Don't think I was ever confused by the
action. I found it easy to follow in both of

472
00:39:38,761 --> 00:39:43,445
those major scenes. And I thought it was a highlight
of the film. I thought they were really well

473
00:39:43,485 --> 00:39:48,849
done. The animation was on point, I think, for
the character and how he moved and how his

474
00:39:48,949 --> 00:39:53,353
liquid biomass worked and everything like that.
There was one cool action scene that I thought

475
00:39:53,433 --> 00:39:57,876
that worked. And that was, you know, before
he emerged fully as Venom in Eddie Brock's

476
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:01,639
apartment, and he was taking out the thugs.
I thought that was a cool action scene. Just

477
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,651
seeing the different ways he was using the Simba.
Like from there all the way to the motorcycle.

478
00:40:07,011 --> 00:40:11,393
It was extremely versatile. Yeah, I was like,
oh I want a Symbiote, give me one. It could

479
00:40:11,413 --> 00:40:15,996
do a lot of different things for sure. Venom
was so cool. I think one of the problems with

480
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:21,999
the movie was that it did take half of the film's
runtime to actually see the Venom character

481
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:27,642
fully realized, which is pretty typical of origin
story films. That's one of the problems with

482
00:40:27,722 --> 00:40:32,264
origin films is that you have to kind of get
to know the character behind the mask before

483
00:40:32,324 --> 00:40:38,148
you care about the hero wearing it. And I guess
that's not a problem so much as it's kind of

484
00:40:38,168 --> 00:40:43,493
just old at this point. We've had so many superhero
films throughout these past decades that the

485
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:47,676
origin stories are pretty formulaic. You have
this guy who discovers this incredible power,

486
00:40:48,297 --> 00:40:51,519
you know, learns how to use the power and then
fights the bad guy. They find a good way to

487
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:55,743
circumvent that lately in the Marvel cinematic
universe with both Spider-Man and Black Panther,

488
00:40:55,763 --> 00:40:59,726
and that they established their characters in
other films before giving them their solo films.

489
00:41:00,427 --> 00:41:04,798
So by the time they get their solo films, the
characters already established. Yeah. But yeah,

490
00:41:04,818 --> 00:41:10,243
in this case, that wasn't what happened. And
it was 45 minutes of just Eddie Brock with

491
00:41:10,283 --> 00:41:15,668
no venom. But that's not necessarily even a
bad thing too, because I definitely think that

492
00:41:16,008 --> 00:41:20,192
Tom Hardy gave a good performance here. Oh,
definitely. I think it was a good performance.

493
00:41:20,212 --> 00:41:24,936
I found it intriguing. I'm not 100%, but I think.
It was a good performance. Everything that

494
00:41:24,956 --> 00:41:29,880
you saw there, I guarantee you was intentional.
You know, I read a lot of people saying that

495
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,931
they laughed at many parts. of this movie that
were perhaps unintentionally hilarious. But

496
00:41:36,031 --> 00:41:40,493
I don't understand how you can question if the
film's attempts at humor were intentional or

497
00:41:40,513 --> 00:41:46,796
not because the film obviously does not take
itself 100% seriously. I found it to be very

498
00:41:46,836 --> 00:41:52,558
self-aware. It's trying to, you know, kind of
send up the typical conventions of modern superhero

499
00:41:52,578 --> 00:41:58,681
films with its darker, unconventional subject
matter. And it kind of takes a sort of schlocky

500
00:41:58,741 --> 00:42:03,255
monster movie tone in some parts. But I mean,
is there any doubt that this was on purpose,

501
00:42:03,335 --> 00:42:09,038
given the director is Ruben Fleischer, who directed
Zombieland after all, which was a send up of

502
00:42:09,078 --> 00:42:13,941
zombie films. Everyone who's questioning whether
or not they should laugh, the answer is yes.

503
00:42:14,441 --> 00:42:18,764
It's supposed to be a dark comedy mixed in with
a superhero action film. There was a lot of

504
00:42:18,824 --> 00:42:23,106
comedy in it, more than I thought there was
gonna be. And sometimes it worked, sometimes

505
00:42:23,126 --> 00:42:28,489
it didn't, sometimes I kinda felt like it was
a little juvenile, like when Venom calls Eddie

506
00:42:28,509 --> 00:42:32,504
Brock a pussy. I thought that was funny. No
one in my theater laughed. Really? No one.

507
00:42:32,865 --> 00:42:37,769
I've seen the movie twice now and I think both
times everyone in the theater chuckled at it.

508
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:41,773
Really? I saw it with a pretty small crowd.
Like I saw it like on a Sunday afternoon. Okay.

509
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:47,419
There weren't many people in the screening I
saw. So. The tone of the film, you know, it

510
00:42:47,459 --> 00:42:53,865
has humor. It is a little bit two dimensional
and comic booky because of that monster movie

511
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:59,597
tone. And you compare that to the more three-dimensional
fleshed out characters that we've been growing

512
00:42:59,637 --> 00:43:04,920
accustomed to seeing in the Marvel films, it
felt kind of out of its time. Because the film

513
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:09,243
didn't take itself so seriously, it did somewhat
feel like some of the superhero films from

514
00:43:09,283 --> 00:43:14,227
the early part of the century, like Blade II.
And that was another good film, also dark,

515
00:43:14,347 --> 00:43:19,650
also didn't take itself too seriously. I agree.
You know, prior to Christopher Nolan's The

516
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:24,954
Dark Knight, a lot of studios just didn't know
how to tackle the subject matter. in a credible

517
00:43:24,994 --> 00:43:30,118
manner and that was likely the main setback
here with this movie I think and why some people

518
00:43:30,178 --> 00:43:36,322
even compared it to like Catwoman and Daredevil
and things like that. Yeah I mean I don't really

519
00:43:36,462 --> 00:43:41,906
get those comparisons again. To me that's really
harsh actually, especially the Catwoman one.

520
00:43:42,526 --> 00:43:46,809
But uh have they not seen Catwoman recently
because that movie is a fucking abomination.

521
00:43:46,850 --> 00:43:52,434
It is it is freaking Horocious. Is that a word
Horocious? Sure you just made a word that's-

522
00:43:52,554 --> 00:43:58,896
No. You don't want to? I don't want to. OK.
It is fucking atrocious. Yeah. I think the

523
00:43:58,936 --> 00:44:05,179
reason Venom didn't come across like those other
films so much to me with its tone and everything

524
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:10,481
is because with a character like Venom, you
can actually get away with that easier, that

525
00:44:10,521 --> 00:44:14,783
tone, because of the somewhat over the top nature
of the character. You know, he's an outer space

526
00:44:14,883 --> 00:44:19,505
alien creature with a grossly exaggerated grin
full of shark like teeth that bite people's

527
00:44:19,545 --> 00:44:24,495
heads off, you know. It's a long ways away from
a super soldier fighting Hitler in World War

528
00:44:24,595 --> 00:44:31,237
II. Yeah. I think what people want, what I certainly
wanted was a certain amount of tongue-in-cheek

529
00:44:31,277 --> 00:44:35,878
element to the story to keep it from being a
straight-up horror film. Though, you know,

530
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:42,020
a horror film could have been interesting too.
But in the comics, some of my favorite Venom

531
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:47,081
moments are when he's acting weird or sweet,
or something other than straight-up monstrous.

532
00:44:47,402 --> 00:44:53,125
You know, it's those quirky moments that add
depth to him. He's always been a different

533
00:44:53,185 --> 00:44:57,987
sort of Klyntar alien in the comics than, you
know, his alien brethren. And I think they

534
00:44:58,027 --> 00:45:01,749
captured that really well here. They said he
was a loser. Right, he admitted to being a

535
00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:06,492
loser. Yeah, which was interesting. I'm somewhat
of a loser on my planet. One of my favorite

536
00:45:06,512 --> 00:45:10,815
memories of reading Venom in the comics were
during his team up with Spider-Man when they

537
00:45:10,855 --> 00:45:16,690
first went up against Carnage. And while Venom
was certainly sinister in that story, where

538
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:20,811
he's constantly telling Carnage that he's gonna
kill him and things like that. There was a

539
00:45:20,891 --> 00:45:25,793
nice moment where they were swinging toward
Madison Square Garden where Carnage was and

540
00:45:26,174 --> 00:45:31,496
Spider-Man's kind of internalizing how weird
it is to be teaming up with Venom. And meanwhile,

541
00:45:31,576 --> 00:45:37,198
Venom is singing Strangers in the Night. It's
just hilarious. That's kind of like the quirkiness

542
00:45:37,218 --> 00:45:41,540
of the character. Those are my favorite moments
with him, I think. Yeah, I wasn't, like I'd

543
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:49,108
never read a comic with Venom, I don't think,
maybe I have. I don't remember, but those moments,

544
00:45:49,228 --> 00:45:52,831
you know, where he's like telling Eddie Brock
to like say you're sorry and stuff like that,

545
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:58,274
it definitely did sort of like challenge my
expectations of the character. When I think

546
00:45:58,314 --> 00:46:01,957
of Venom, I do think of it as just, you know,
like this bad ass monster, not as someone who's

547
00:46:02,017 --> 00:46:08,761
kind of almost goofy in a way. Right, right.
Love that guy, love that character. I think

548
00:46:08,801 --> 00:46:14,545
that the dark humor was well balanced with the
sci-fi action. I think overall the film was

549
00:46:15,042 --> 00:46:19,765
pretty well balanced and palatable for a mainstream
audience. Though if it were rated R and it

550
00:46:19,785 --> 00:46:24,569
showed Venom actually eating his enemies and
had more adult language and you know, stuff

551
00:46:24,609 --> 00:46:30,714
in the vein of Deadpool, it might've actually
been a better film. I agree. But possibly only

552
00:46:30,834 --> 00:46:34,618
marginally so, I think. I'm surprised you can't
show someone biting someone else's head off

553
00:46:35,018 --> 00:46:39,722
in a PG-13 film. I was like, what? As long as
you don't show blood, right? I mean, dumb.

554
00:46:39,962 --> 00:46:45,562
But they were so subtle about it here that I
wasn't even 100% sure. during those moments

555
00:46:45,622 --> 00:46:49,583
if their heads were actually bitten off. It
was like, did that just happen? Yeah. They

556
00:46:49,844 --> 00:46:54,766
really move the camera away from it quick. But
in the end, I think I'd rather sacrifice the

557
00:46:54,806 --> 00:47:01,308
gore and keep the potential of a Venom Spider-Man
team up. True. It may be wishful thinking,

558
00:47:01,688 --> 00:47:06,410
but it's not an impossibility. They're on opposite
sides of the country, I mean. Right. And my

559
00:47:06,450 --> 00:47:12,213
guess is that maybe in a sequel to Venom, he's
gonna fight Carnage, and maybe Carnage is going

560
00:47:12,253 --> 00:47:16,975
to go like across the country on a killing spree.
Venom is gonna chase him to New York because

561
00:47:16,995 --> 00:47:22,259
he feels responsible being that carnage is his
offspring. And maybe like have a Spider-Man

562
00:47:22,299 --> 00:47:27,684
team up kind of moment where at one point maybe
Eddie is knocked unconscious and the symbiote

563
00:47:28,024 --> 00:47:32,608
has to attach itself to Spider-Man for a while.
I mean, that might be the best adaptation of

564
00:47:32,688 --> 00:47:38,653
symbiote Spidey that we get within this universe,
within this franchise. Yeah. And you know,

565
00:47:38,693 --> 00:47:42,115
given how they treated the source material here,
I mean, if that's the best that we could get,

566
00:47:42,175 --> 00:47:46,482
then I'll take it because I think we have a
great Realization of the character of venom

567
00:47:46,622 --> 00:47:51,544
within this film one that could be definitely
carried forward in future films I think they

568
00:47:51,564 --> 00:47:55,326
were trying to go for something marvelous, and
that's why they didn't go the rated-r route

569
00:47:55,926 --> 00:48:00,528
Well, I don't think the film itself was marvelous
at all. I think it was an attempt to be marvelous

570
00:48:00,688 --> 00:48:04,409
I don't think it was you don't think no. I think
it was a purposeful attempt to not be like

571
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:08,871
Marvel I think the director has stated as such
hmm actually And I think he did a good job

572
00:48:08,931 --> 00:48:15,442
of making the tone dark and edgy But also just
on the borderline of possibly being able to

573
00:48:15,462 --> 00:48:20,445
be included in the mainstream Marvel Cinematic
Universe. Or the Spider-Man universe. Sony's

574
00:48:20,485 --> 00:48:25,249
Spider-Man, whatever the hell it's called. I
think what primarily didn't work with this

575
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:29,872
movie goes back to the self-aware tone of the
film. Some of the dialogue and the character

576
00:48:29,912 --> 00:48:35,315
reactions and the characters themselves weren't
real feeling. Some of the acting. Especially

577
00:48:35,335 --> 00:48:41,168
Carlton Drake, the cardboard cutout villain.
or Anne, the cardboard cutout ex-girlfriend.

578
00:48:41,748 --> 00:48:46,712
I think the only one that actually felt real
here was Eddie Brock, and maybe actually Jenny

579
00:48:46,752 --> 00:48:51,656
Slade's character, Dr. Skirth, I think she felt
nuanced enough to be real as well. Yeah, it

580
00:48:51,676 --> 00:48:56,480
was sad when she died. Yeah, but yeah, let's
go into the character breakdown, and we'll

581
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:00,244
start off with Eddie Brock. Eddie Brock and
Venom are gonna be separate in this character

582
00:49:00,264 --> 00:49:04,546
breakdown, because they were very separate characters
in the film. As far as Eddie Brock goes, I

583
00:49:04,586 --> 00:49:09,187
think Tom Hardy's performance was intriguing
as I said before. I think he elevated the material

584
00:49:09,227 --> 00:49:15,909
he was given by injecting just a metric ton
of nuance, which made him feel believable.

585
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:20,731
And it was only because of Brock's performance
that I believed his relationship with Anne,

586
00:49:21,051 --> 00:49:25,152
especially in the scene when he visited her
apartment and met her new boyfriend. That felt

587
00:49:25,252 --> 00:49:29,606
real. That was a good scene. She was like, why
are you here, Eddie? Because I miss you. It

588
00:49:29,646 --> 00:49:32,527
wasn't too long ago that we were going to get
married. I was wondering if we might find our

589
00:49:32,547 --> 00:49:38,309
way back to that. That line, I thought, almost
belonged in a different movie. It was the only

590
00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:43,331
time that I thought that these two actually
had viable chemistry and a viable relationship

591
00:49:43,351 --> 00:49:48,394
at one point. That was one of my more favorite
Eddie Brock character scenes. I mean, the first

592
00:49:48,754 --> 00:49:53,776
half of this film, when they're setting up the
peril of Eddie Brock and just like how his

593
00:49:54,016 --> 00:49:58,234
choices have consequences and stuff like that
and everything that stemmed from that. I thought

594
00:49:58,374 --> 00:50:03,618
this was all fantastic setup. Yeah, it really
was. In a way, like I think a lot of my problems

595
00:50:03,659 --> 00:50:09,484
don't really come about until he gets the symbiote.
Because before that, it was a compelling film.

596
00:50:09,984 --> 00:50:14,088
Eddie Brock was a compelling character. Yeah,
I think because of Tom Hardy's performance.

597
00:50:14,488 --> 00:50:19,392
He's such a great actor, he really makes you
empathize with him. And on top of that, he's

598
00:50:19,472 --> 00:50:24,937
fun to watch. I thought his voice was gonna
be grating based on the trailers, but I didn't

599
00:50:24,957 --> 00:50:30,824
mind it. He sells his voices for sure. Yeah.
Eddie Brock's character arc was strange though.

600
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:36,167
Like he started out on top with his investigative
reports on the Eddie Brock show. He started

601
00:50:36,208 --> 00:50:40,790
out giving a shit about his fellow man. You
know, standing up for others seemed to be his

602
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:45,813
life's purpose because he's a good guy, you
know? But then he stooped low to steal a document

603
00:50:45,833 --> 00:50:50,596
from his girlfriend to support his agenda against
Carlton Drake, then hit rock bottom losing

604
00:50:50,636 --> 00:50:56,815
his job, his relationship, and his home. which
somehow caused him to forgo his life's purpose

605
00:50:56,875 --> 00:51:02,217
and be done with giving a shit about his fellow
man. Which is what he explicitly told Dr. Skirth.

606
00:51:02,677 --> 00:51:09,940
And it was weird because it seemed like he resented
society for his own fuck-ups. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

607
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:14,762
I kind of wish they would have set up Carlton
Drake as more of a villain before Eddie was

608
00:51:14,802 --> 00:51:18,703
saying how much he didn't like him. Right. Because
by that moment I was like, well, why? He seems

609
00:51:18,723 --> 00:51:23,765
like not a horrible guy. Even in the interview,
like, Eddie Brock was the one being the asshole.

610
00:51:24,254 --> 00:51:28,817
You know? Right. I didn't quite understand that.
And, but you're right. He turned his back on

611
00:51:28,857 --> 00:51:34,582
society for, for his poor choice. And that was
hard to relate to. Yeah. So he's, you know,

612
00:51:34,622 --> 00:51:38,465
he's a flawed character, which also makes him
feel real. But yeah, again, hard to relate

613
00:51:38,505 --> 00:51:43,209
to. But on the Golden Gate bridge, which was
a fantastic scene where it almost seems like

614
00:51:43,229 --> 00:51:47,733
he's contemplating suicide, which is in the
comics. Oh, really? Yeah. That's why he went

615
00:51:47,773 --> 00:51:51,616
to the church was to ask for forgiveness for
what he was about to do, and that's where he

616
00:51:51,636 --> 00:51:55,370
got the symbiote in the comics at the church.
But yeah, it was a great scene. It's where

617
00:51:55,410 --> 00:52:00,273
he had his change of heart and decides to investigate
the Life Foundation and help others after all.

618
00:52:00,873 --> 00:52:05,996
I think it would have been a little bit more
helpful if the movie had been more clear with

619
00:52:06,036 --> 00:52:10,139
how one makes the leap from taking down villains
with investigative journalism to taking down

620
00:52:10,179 --> 00:52:14,741
villains with vigilanteism. Because I wasn't
sure if he necessarily showed vigilante tendencies

621
00:52:14,821 --> 00:52:20,264
prior to getting the symbiote. Right. No, I
mean, he didn't. He let that one guy extort

622
00:52:20,344 --> 00:52:25,506
the bodega owner. Right, yeah. That would have
been an interesting exploration even if briefly,

623
00:52:25,906 --> 00:52:31,348
but after his change of heart on the bridge,
at that point, there wasn't much more character

624
00:52:31,368 --> 00:52:35,449
growth for Eddie Brock and the growth really
shifted at that point to the symbiote Venom.

625
00:52:35,909 --> 00:52:41,110
Yeah. So let's talk about Venom, who was voiced
by Tom Hardy. The character of Venom himself

626
00:52:41,811 --> 00:52:46,612
is really what saves this film and makes it
as fun and enjoyable as it is. Well, it's what

627
00:52:46,632 --> 00:52:51,653
you went to see, you know, he's the titular
character. Yeah, I mean, it's crazy how much

628
00:52:51,733 --> 00:52:58,649
joy I get. out of just seeing that huge ass
grin. And the voice, Tom Hardy nailed it. And

629
00:52:58,669 --> 00:53:03,151
though he was a blast to watch, it was hard
to understand Venom's motivations, I think.

630
00:53:03,812 --> 00:53:08,714
Because let's follow his arc. So first Venom
wants to get Drake's rocket, just like Riot,

631
00:53:08,754 --> 00:53:14,177
to reconnect with his brethren on the comet
and invade Earth. Then all of a sudden, yeah,

632
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:19,300
at some point, Venom rejects the idea and decides
he's instead going to live on Earth because

633
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:24,379
he likes it here and because of Eddie. He says
that explicitly he made the decision because

634
00:53:24,419 --> 00:53:29,142
of Eddie, but we don't know when that happened
or why that happened Yeah, other than you know,

635
00:53:29,162 --> 00:53:33,104
he's like on my planet I'm kind of a loser and
that's kind of the most explanation we get

636
00:53:33,264 --> 00:53:38,927
as to his change of heart, right? Which to me
like that was laughable. I was like what? Okay

637
00:53:40,448 --> 00:53:44,810
Like I'd rather hang out with you here than
be with my loser siblings or whatever Yeah,

638
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:49,192
that was that was a loser with my siblings,
you know Yeah, that was a problem for me the

639
00:53:49,232 --> 00:53:55,377
symbiotes like motivations We don't learn until
far down the road in this film. Like initially,

640
00:53:55,397 --> 00:54:01,562
like the stakes of the film are that Eddie's
gonna die. But it's not until like the final

641
00:54:01,582 --> 00:54:05,705
battle almost that it's like, hey, you know,
the symbiotes are going to bring back an entire

642
00:54:05,986 --> 00:54:10,769
planet of symbiotes and take over our planet.
They're like, oh, too little too late. Maybe

643
00:54:10,810 --> 00:54:16,234
not too little, but definitely a little bit
too late. Yeah. But overall with Venom, again,

644
00:54:16,494 --> 00:54:21,006
he's the star of the show. The reason why I
get so much joy out of this movie and why I

645
00:54:21,086 --> 00:54:24,487
liked it more than like say Ant-Man and the
Wasp or something like that is because of the

646
00:54:24,547 --> 00:54:29,149
Eddie Brock Venom relationship. It's like a
buddy movie. It is, it absolutely is a buddy

647
00:54:29,369 --> 00:54:35,012
movie. Yeah. One thing that confused me is like
the knowledge that Venom had like right off

648
00:54:35,032 --> 00:54:39,454
the bat, like 60 gigahertz or something like
that. Or the 60 gigahertz frequency? Yeah.

649
00:54:39,474 --> 00:54:42,335
60 megahertz frequency? I don't know. And it's
like, how long have you been on earth that

650
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:48,097
you like, you know, know words like that? I
guess just being inside of Eddie, but then.

651
00:54:48,598 --> 00:54:52,441
But then he didn't know some things about Eddie
that he maybe should have known. Exactly. So

652
00:54:52,481 --> 00:54:56,645
maybe he was just reading the wrong pages on
Eddie's brain or something like that. I don't

653
00:54:56,665 --> 00:55:01,549
know. It's hard to know. Let's talk about Anne
Wayne played by Michelle Williams. I thought

654
00:55:01,870 --> 00:55:05,933
she did a commendable job with the material
she was given. I think a lot of those lines

655
00:55:05,953 --> 00:55:13,680
would have been a hard sell. Like, hospital,
right now, or Eddie, I think I just ate a guy's

656
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:19,395
head. Yeah. But despite her being an overall
like cliche girlfriend type, I thought she

657
00:55:19,415 --> 00:55:24,277
was likeable. I didn't really care for the performance
honestly. Like at all. Really? Like at all.

658
00:55:24,577 --> 00:55:30,359
I think she did a horrible job. What? She did
a horrible job. Really? Yeah. I don't know

659
00:55:30,379 --> 00:55:37,941
about that. I liked it. Her reactions did not
seem believable in almost every way, I think.

660
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:42,673
Yeah, I would agree with that. I don't think
her actions were believable. I think most of

661
00:55:42,693 --> 00:55:46,396
her reactions were kind of tug-and-cheek. I
think her performance was a little bit tongue-in-cheek.

662
00:55:46,496 --> 00:55:52,061
Yeah, I agree. Yeah, that's what it felt like
for sure. Like she knew she was in this movie

663
00:55:52,081 --> 00:55:56,845
that was beneath her or something like that.
I don't know. But I liked that. I don't know.

664
00:55:56,945 --> 00:56:02,769
I guess it depends on what you enjoy as a moviegoer.
Like to me, I appreciated the subtle tongue-in-cheek

665
00:56:02,789 --> 00:56:07,513
moments in this film. But, you know, if you
take your superhero movies super seriously.

666
00:56:08,106 --> 00:56:15,569
then you may not enjoy that. And I do, I do.
I really like her turn as She-Venom. That was

667
00:56:15,649 --> 00:56:20,431
something that I was not expecting to see in
this film. Is that from the comics? It is,

668
00:56:20,671 --> 00:56:27,214
yeah. Anne has taken on the Venom symbiote several
times. And I kinda wanna see more of her, actually.

669
00:56:27,374 --> 00:56:31,336
Is that weird? Like I remember seeing She-Venom
for the first time in the comics, and I was

670
00:56:31,356 --> 00:56:37,662
like, whoa, that freaky ass monster has a nice
body. I learned something about myself today.

671
00:56:37,982 --> 00:56:42,264
Oh jeez. She was super cool though. I liked
the voice that she had where she's like, hello

672
00:56:42,304 --> 00:56:48,407
Eddie. And the kiss, that was, it was just such
a bizarre fucking moment. It was. It was awkward.

673
00:56:48,427 --> 00:56:53,309
It was almost brilliant in its weirdness, I
think. Let's move on to Carlton Drake, played

674
00:56:53,349 --> 00:56:57,410
by Riz Ahmed. I think I mentioned earlier that
I thought he was pretty cardboard cut out,

675
00:56:57,491 --> 00:57:02,753
though I think Riz did the best he could given
the material like Michelle Williams. I think

676
00:57:02,813 --> 00:57:08,277
he did a good acting job. Yeah. I think he did
a really good acting job. The character, he's

677
00:57:08,297 --> 00:57:13,901
a little bland. Very, very, you know, God complex
character, generic God complex character, who

678
00:57:14,042 --> 00:57:18,706
just kind of hates humanity for what it is and-
Or thinks he's above it. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

679
00:57:19,006 --> 00:57:24,751
He's supposed to be this unscrupulous, ambitious,
super logical villain, but without any nuance,

680
00:57:25,131 --> 00:57:30,056
like Eddie Brock, he mainly just comes across
as super generic. So I mean, like he did have

681
00:57:30,096 --> 00:57:33,946
those few interesting lines about being God
or something. but in the end it wasn't enough

682
00:57:33,986 --> 00:57:39,350
to save him from being described as mostly bland.
Right. And he does make some weird choices

683
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:43,753
and if I was working for him, I'd be like, I'm
not working for this guy anymore. Jenny Slate

684
00:57:43,793 --> 00:57:47,936
totally had the right idea. It's like, fuck
this guy, he's weird. Wouldn't want him as

685
00:57:47,956 --> 00:57:52,479
a boss. So that's it for the characters. I don't
think there were any other standout characters

686
00:57:52,519 --> 00:57:57,542
to talk about, but let's get into these highlights
from the film, the story highlights. So the

687
00:57:57,562 --> 00:58:03,506
movie starts off with the rocket crash on earth
from the Life Foundation. Yeah. and it felt

688
00:58:03,546 --> 00:58:08,370
very X-Files to me. Like I could've swore I
was watching an episode of the X-Files. I agree.

689
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:14,514
They had a nice little Easter egg in that first
scene though with J. Jonah Jameson's son. Really?

690
00:58:14,734 --> 00:58:19,517
Yeah. Oh, he didn't make that connection. Yeah,
cause in the comics, he's an astronaut. And

691
00:58:19,798 --> 00:58:24,181
actually, so what they did with this movie is
they took the animated series origin, where

692
00:58:24,561 --> 00:58:31,005
in the 90s cartoon, Venom didn't come from the
secret wars event. He came down with John Jameson.

693
00:58:31,406 --> 00:58:37,350
from space and that's what they did here. Yeah.
So while Venom's origin here is a radical departure

694
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:42,374
from the comics and I think a lot of people
maybe wanted to see the symbiote on Spider-Man

695
00:58:42,434 --> 00:58:49,380
first, you know, it wasn't entirely unfaithful
to things that we've seen before that have

696
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:54,104
been praised such as the animated series. Right.
So that was kind of nice. Isn't his son like

697
00:58:54,124 --> 00:59:00,349
a werewolf? Yeah, in the comics, John Jameson
is the wolf man or the man wolf, I forget what

698
00:59:00,369 --> 00:59:06,006
they call him. But yeah, he's a werewolf and
he gets that ability from his visit to the

699
00:59:06,026 --> 00:59:11,631
moon, which is kind of weird. From then, I don't
think there were too many highlights of the

700
00:59:11,672 --> 00:59:16,696
film up until about the midpoints where we get
the apartment fight, which we talked briefly

701
00:59:16,736 --> 00:59:21,921
about before. Really like the versatility that
was shown here and this is when Venom really

702
00:59:21,961 --> 00:59:27,234
starts speaking to him. We get to know the character.
Eddie beats these dudes up. and Venom tells

703
00:59:27,254 --> 00:59:30,757
them to pile their bodies in the corner and
bite their heads off and stuff. And it was

704
00:59:30,777 --> 00:59:35,920
like, what the fuck did he just say? Exactly,
exactly. And then he jumps out the window and

705
00:59:36,521 --> 00:59:40,664
we think that Eddie's gonna die, but the symbiote
saves him and swings him into this other building.

706
00:59:40,724 --> 00:59:44,967
That was cool. And then they start shooting
at him, but Eddie's able to put up a shield.

707
00:59:44,987 --> 00:59:49,570
Put up a shield, that was cool. You just start
seeing all these amazing moments in succession.

708
00:59:49,850 --> 00:59:55,859
I think one highlight before the action scene,
if I may real quick. Yeah. was when he first

709
00:59:55,899 --> 00:59:59,822
comes to his apartment after he's been infected
and he's just like eating chicken from the

710
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:04,586
trash can, he's just like feeling really terrible,
like you really feel how bad he feels. It was

711
01:00:04,606 --> 01:00:09,450
like good camera work. Good acting too. Yeah,
really good acting. When he puked, I thought,

712
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:13,073
oh, I wonder if he actually puked. I know. I
don't know, maybe the sound effects, maybe

713
01:00:13,093 --> 01:00:17,297
it was the lurch he did when he gagged, but
it looked like real puking. But no, when he

714
01:00:17,397 --> 01:00:21,981
looked in the mirror and like Venom's eyes come
up for the first time, you just hear him scream.

715
01:00:22,614 --> 01:00:27,577
That was like my scream as well. I was like,
ah! He just like falls onto the top. I thought

716
01:00:27,597 --> 01:00:32,441
that was funny. It was funny and scary. It was
just a good moment. Yeah. After the apartment

717
01:00:32,541 --> 01:00:38,586
fight scene, we go into the motorcycle chase,
which I thought was pretty cool. It was a little

718
01:00:38,606 --> 01:00:43,990
bit reminiscent of the San Francisco chase scene
that we just saw in Ant-Man and the Wasp. Yeah.

719
01:00:44,410 --> 01:00:49,558
But I maybe actually liked this one a little
bit more. I did, yeah. There were a lot of

720
01:00:49,578 --> 01:00:53,699
different things that Symbiote was able to do.
He was able to push cars aside, he was able

721
01:00:53,719 --> 01:00:59,302
to grab onto railings and jump over bridges
and move steering wheels of the enemy cars.

722
01:00:59,582 --> 01:01:04,244
I think one of the coolest moments that he had
kind of reminded me of the 89 Batman, where

723
01:01:04,564 --> 01:01:09,946
the Batmobile shot out this grappling hook that
latched onto a street pole and made him turn

724
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:15,548
a tight 90 degree turn, 180 degree turn. It
was a really tight turn, yeah. It was almost

725
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:20,418
the same thing, where the Symbiote latched out,
grabbed onto a street pole. and skid Eddie

726
01:01:20,438 --> 01:01:25,521
Brock onto his side, but was protecting him
as like a cushion on the ground and then brought

727
01:01:25,561 --> 01:01:30,824
him back up after he made the turn. That was
one of the more intriguing uses of the power

728
01:01:30,844 --> 01:01:35,746
that I've never seen in the comics or anything
like that. But yeah, Venom can almost do anything

729
01:01:36,067 --> 01:01:41,810
in that regard. He was a shield, he was offensive,
he was defensive. It was just such a cool power

730
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:46,552
set. It is really cool. One thing that really
bothered me during this scene though was just

731
01:01:46,612 --> 01:01:52,811
how destructive the Like they just did not give
a fuck. No. Like they were blowing shit up

732
01:01:52,851 --> 01:01:58,393
with these drones, which even then it's like,
those have gotta be expensive drones, right?

733
01:01:58,473 --> 01:02:01,735
And also why you're trying to blow up the guy
who has the symbiote, right? Exactly. Are you

734
01:02:01,755 --> 01:02:05,016
trying to kill your symbiote? They're like just
like plowing into cars and stuff. How are they

735
01:02:05,036 --> 01:02:09,738
gonna explain that to the cops? I was thinking
that the whole time. Like when this finishes

736
01:02:09,798 --> 01:02:13,660
and like the cops come for you, what are you
gonna say? Right. It's gonna be one hell of

737
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:17,821
an investigation. Exactly. I don't envy the
police officer that has to do the paperwork

738
01:02:17,841 --> 01:02:23,023
for this. sure. But no, like, you know, when
it does end, we get the reveal of Venom, the

739
01:02:23,063 --> 01:02:27,365
full body, like, envelopment. Yeah. It's really
cool. I thought that was really cool. And then

740
01:02:27,385 --> 01:02:31,007
he bites the dude's head off. Yes. That was
great. Yeah. And right after that, you know,

741
01:02:31,027 --> 01:02:35,548
he like swims to that, to that buoy. And that's
the first time we see like Venom's like head

742
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:39,770
come out and like just start talking to Eddie.
Yeah. Is that from the comics? Did you like

743
01:02:39,810 --> 01:02:44,052
that? Yes. Yeah. He's done that in the comics
before. Okay. Um, yeah, he definitely has his

744
01:02:44,112 --> 01:02:48,418
own face and he's spoken to him like that before.
I liked that scene. I especially like... some

745
01:02:48,458 --> 01:02:51,960
of Venom's dialogue where Eddie was like, are
you gonna eat more people? And Venom was like,

746
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:58,305
most likely. I like that a lot. Such a great
character, especially in one of the later scenes

747
01:02:58,345 --> 01:03:03,689
where Eddie goes to his old place of work, the
network, and he and Venom climb up the building.

748
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:07,752
And Venom gets to the top and it's just kind
of like this iconic image where he's looking

749
01:03:07,812 --> 01:03:12,655
over San Francisco and like admiring the beauty
of the city and everything. And he's like,

750
01:03:12,675 --> 01:03:16,838
it'll be a shame to see it all destroyed. And
Eddie's like, what? And then the plane flies

751
01:03:16,898 --> 01:03:22,802
by and shocks the symbiote off of him. And like
never before in a movie have I ever felt so

752
01:03:22,822 --> 01:03:26,844
much like I was falling as that scene right
now. That's like my worst nightmare. It was

753
01:03:26,864 --> 01:03:30,186
like well shot. Like he's sliding down the side
of this building and he's pretty sure he's

754
01:03:30,206 --> 01:03:32,807
going to die because he's afraid of heights
and everything like that. It was a good camera

755
01:03:32,847 --> 01:03:36,910
angle. Just like you see the feet. It's almost
like a POV shot. You see his feet dangling

756
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:41,472
and it's just like the ground is just coming
up towards him and it's like, oh, shit. But

757
01:03:41,512 --> 01:03:46,275
luckily he gets rescued. And then from there.
he goes into the lobby fight downstairs. Yeah.

758
01:03:46,895 --> 01:03:52,117
And I really liked the effects there because,
you know, so far we've seen Venom a lot in

759
01:03:52,157 --> 01:03:56,059
shadow and in darkness and things like that.
We got a few really good money shots here,

760
01:03:56,419 --> 01:03:59,900
despite, you know, there being a lot of smoke
and stuff like that. But when like the strobe

761
01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:04,282
effect would go off with the flashbangs and
you see him react to that. And even in the

762
01:04:04,302 --> 01:04:10,185
thermal vision in the sniper's camera, I swear
that was Venom straight lifted off of the comic

763
01:04:10,225 --> 01:04:14,674
book pages. I was so happy with that scene.
and how he was like so vicious, he was like

764
01:04:14,694 --> 01:04:19,016
picking guys up, jumping in the air and like
spinning around and like throwing them away

765
01:04:19,236 --> 01:04:23,758
and things like that. It was just, it was awesome.
Like leaping up onto the rafters and like ripping

766
01:04:23,818 --> 01:04:28,160
off beams and throwing them at people. Yeah.
At that point I was like, I don't care what

767
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:33,963
happens with the rest of this movie, I'm definitely
satisfied with at least this moment. Hmm. It

768
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:37,325
reminded me kind of like almost like Batman,
like he was like a ninja, just like pulling

769
01:04:37,345 --> 01:04:41,630
guys out of the smoke and stuff like that. Right.
Yeah, that was pretty cool. There's something

770
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:47,212
frightening about that. The attacker you can't
see. Right. So later on, you know, he goes

771
01:04:47,232 --> 01:04:51,353
to the hospital and then and then he gets captured
by the Life Foundation and then he gets rescued

772
01:04:51,393 --> 01:04:55,614
by she venom. I think we already spoke about
that. I really thought it was going to be the

773
01:04:55,694 --> 01:04:59,995
dog in the forest, but I was really glad that
it was she venom because that was such a fantastic

774
01:05:00,075 --> 01:05:05,957
Easter egg. I really like how protective venom
at that point gets of Anne where like she wants

775
01:05:05,977 --> 01:05:10,319
to follow along and he's like, no, it's going
to get ugly. And Eddie's like, she can fight

776
01:05:10,359 --> 01:05:14,362
ugly. And she's like, yeah, I can fight ugly.
And he was like, not today. And he like runs

777
01:05:14,462 --> 01:05:18,946
off and she's like, that's bullshit. I thought
that was pretty funny. But also great character

778
01:05:18,986 --> 01:05:23,930
moment. I don't know if that was funny. It was
funny. Why was Venom more concerned about her

779
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:28,694
than Eddie? I don't know, that's a good question.
Maybe because Eddie knows her better. And maybe

780
01:05:28,714 --> 01:05:32,037
he didn't wanna do it alone or something. I
don't know. That is a good question, that's

781
01:05:32,057 --> 01:05:37,081
valid. Let's go to the final fight. The setup
for the final fight was a little off, I think.

782
01:05:37,558 --> 01:05:41,899
Like, can you just really throw together a last
minute rocket launch without a crew or anything

783
01:05:41,939 --> 01:05:46,240
like that? Those things have to be like exactly
timed. Right. Because there's a ton of math

784
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:50,541
involved. Right, like is the Earth facing the
right direction for when you launch off? Are

785
01:05:50,561 --> 01:05:54,523
you gonna be wasting fuel? Are you gonna be
heading toward the comet itself, right? Or

786
01:05:54,543 --> 01:05:58,484
do you have enough fuel in case you need to
make a correction like that or something? It

787
01:05:58,504 --> 01:06:02,445
was a little weird. But it was cool how Riot
just kind of like took out the entire mission

788
01:06:02,465 --> 01:06:06,860
control with those giant... like blades. I don't
know, man. I'm sure one of those computers

789
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:11,744
was really important for the mission. Yeah.
You know, and uses one of those computers later

790
01:06:11,864 --> 01:06:16,167
on to activate the PA system, which startles
the symbiotes later on during their fight.

791
01:06:16,247 --> 01:06:19,590
And then she has that horrible line, which is
like, told you, I can fight ugly or something.

792
01:06:21,632 --> 01:06:26,416
So the fight itself was so cool. It started
off on that bridge, connecting the launch pad

793
01:06:26,516 --> 01:06:32,861
to the station and Venom's chasing riot on there.
And they have a fight where like Venom was

794
01:06:32,881 --> 01:06:36,798
like, he has shit. you wouldn't believe or something
like that. Yeah, shit you've never seen before.

795
01:06:36,858 --> 01:06:41,400
Yeah, and Wright really did. Like he busted
out some sweet ass moves that I've never really

796
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:45,581
imagined a symbiote could do. Like he had that
swinging mace, and like there was a one part

797
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:50,302
where he like shoved his spikes into the bridge
below them and was like popping them up, trying

798
01:06:50,322 --> 01:06:54,944
to impale Venom. But Venom was like doing all
these crazy cool back flips and like swinging

799
01:06:55,124 --> 01:06:58,565
off the bridge and back on and things like that.
Yeah. It was just such a cool fight scene between

800
01:06:58,585 --> 01:07:02,054
those characters I thought. I really liked it.
Do you wish they would have gone with like

801
01:07:02,074 --> 01:07:08,317
a different symbiote, like the blue one or the
yellow one? Yes, I do. While Riot did look

802
01:07:08,398 --> 01:07:13,080
cool, you know, that kind of like silver, gray,
gunmetal finish kind of thing, I wish they

803
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:17,182
would have gone somebody who is more easily
discernible from Venom. Maybe somebody like

804
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:21,905
Scream, who actually was, I would say, the primary
member of those Life Foundation symbiotes,

805
01:07:21,965 --> 01:07:26,367
I think. Yeah. She was like the head of that
group. Like the other four, they kind of actually,

806
01:07:26,767 --> 01:07:30,489
they merged into one symbiote called Hybrid.
They were kind of a little bit expendable.

807
01:07:30,826 --> 01:07:35,028
I think she had the unique look with the long
hair and the fact that she was yellow and stuff

808
01:07:35,048 --> 01:07:38,550
like that. I think it would have been cool to
see her as the villain. Or at least have the

809
01:07:38,590 --> 01:07:42,472
symbiote be yellow. Even if it wasn't Scream.
Even if it was still Riot or whatever. I don't

810
01:07:42,512 --> 01:07:46,495
know. Just would have been cool. I think the
other two symbiotes that the Life Foundation

811
01:07:46,535 --> 01:07:50,357
managed to capture, so they got four total.
So they got Venom. We know that. One of them

812
01:07:50,417 --> 01:07:54,860
escaped, which was Riot. But the yellow one
and the blue one, I think that was Scream.

813
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:58,754
And the other one was Agony. Phage and Lasher
were nowhere to be seen. It would've been cool

814
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:02,837
to see them here too, especially since they
seemed so expendable. But back to the fight,

815
01:08:03,258 --> 01:08:06,861
after they finally get to the actual rocket
and they're like trying to rip each other apart

816
01:08:06,901 --> 01:08:12,225
and stuff like that, there's a weird moment
where Riot absorbs venom and they became like

817
01:08:12,406 --> 01:08:17,069
one being for like a second before Anne was
able to separate them with the noise. Right.

818
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:20,753
But he had the same look later on too, so I
wasn't sure like if they were still combined

819
01:08:20,793 --> 01:08:24,776
or not. I don't know, that part was kind of
confusing. Yeah, those like little tendrils

820
01:08:24,796 --> 01:08:29,879
that were coming off his back. Yeah. So there
are two bodies in one body? I'm not sure how

821
01:08:29,899 --> 01:08:33,742
the physics of that worked. I'm not sure how
the physics of venom works to begin with. So

822
01:08:33,762 --> 01:08:37,183
because sometimes you see venom being ripped
apart and Eddie Brock's face is around like

823
01:08:37,203 --> 01:08:40,946
venom's like chest area. And sometimes you see
venom's face being ripped off and Eddie Brock's

824
01:08:40,966 --> 01:08:45,728
face is right beneath it. So it's hard to tell
exactly where Eddie Brock is inside of venom

825
01:08:45,768 --> 01:08:50,791
at any given moment. I assume that when the
two merged, Eddie and Drake were like just

826
01:08:50,811 --> 01:08:56,122
kind of like smashed up right against each other.
It's a little awkward. It's like, hey. But

827
01:08:56,342 --> 01:09:00,083
the fight that the two had when the symbiotes
were off was pretty interesting. Like Eddie

828
01:09:00,123 --> 01:09:04,445
Brock had this like weird martial arts moment
where he like slow motion spun around and punched

829
01:09:04,685 --> 01:09:08,887
Drake right in the face. Yeah, there was a lot
of slow motion in this in this film. Yeah.

830
01:09:08,927 --> 01:09:14,149
But I like the way that Venom ultimately defeated
Riot using the symbiotes weakness of fire,

831
01:09:14,309 --> 01:09:18,931
you know? Yeah. He destroyed the rocket's fuel
tanks as it was flying up and the whole thing

832
01:09:18,991 --> 01:09:23,813
exploded and nearly killed Venom himself. Do
you understand why Venom like told Anne earlier

833
01:09:23,873 --> 01:09:27,463
like all of his weaknesses? That was weird.
That was awkward in the car. I think it was

834
01:09:27,483 --> 01:09:32,947
more for the audience. There was a lot of like...
But also I think he liked Anne. He even stated

835
01:09:32,987 --> 01:09:36,669
that much and that's why he told Eddie to get
in the car. I think he had a soft spot for

836
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:41,613
Anne. And it may have been grafted on from Eddie's
memories of her or something like that. Oh,

837
01:09:41,653 --> 01:09:45,916
by that? That's a good explanation. So he was
like super vulnerable and honest with her basically.

838
01:09:46,296 --> 01:09:51,340
Huh. And that takes us to one of the last highlights
of the movie. When they're talking on the steps,

839
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:56,139
I thought it was so fucking hilarious. when
all of a sudden Venom's voice pops back in

840
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:01,984
and he's like, look at her, she doesn't even
realize that we're going to get her back. He's

841
01:10:02,024 --> 01:10:08,569
like, we love you, Anne. It was so great. Uh,
Venom playing Cupid is just awesome. But the

842
01:10:08,609 --> 01:10:14,033
very final scene, the mid credit scene of the
movie is where we're introduced to Carnage

843
01:10:14,174 --> 01:10:18,777
or Cletus Kasady being played by Woody Harrelson.
That scene felt a little bit off to me. It

844
01:10:18,857 --> 01:10:22,992
was. It was bad. It was really bad. I don't
know if it was Harrelson's acting or if it

845
01:10:23,012 --> 01:10:28,255
was his wig or if it was his dialogue. It was
probably a combination of all three. They were

846
01:10:28,295 --> 01:10:33,478
trying to make it seem creepy, but it wasn't,
like at all. It was tongue-in-cheek. Maybe.

847
01:10:33,978 --> 01:10:39,102
See, that I'm not sure on because Woody Harrelson
did look fucking bat shit crazy out of his

848
01:10:39,142 --> 01:10:45,986
mind, but not entirely in a scary way. No. In
somewhat a funny way, I think. They could have

849
01:10:46,006 --> 01:10:51,410
done a much better job like setting the atmosphere
for this. Uh-huh. Because it was almost comical

850
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:56,153
the way the guard was talking with Eddie. And
by the time you get to Cletus and he's like

851
01:10:56,253 --> 01:11:00,156
writing Eddie's name in blood and it's just
like, you know, the things he's saying it's

852
01:11:00,576 --> 01:11:04,259
do you want me to turn on the serial killer?
I could talk about like the Dada patterns of

853
01:11:04,339 --> 01:11:11,704
arterial spray. Uh-huh. And just like, who wrote
this? I think they were going for silence the

854
01:11:11,744 --> 01:11:19,126
lambs and they got more Suicide Squad than Silence
of the Lambs, I think. Oh, okay. Low blow,

855
01:11:19,426 --> 01:11:25,271
wow. But that does it for the review. I think
we hit everything. All the story highlights,

856
01:11:25,491 --> 01:11:29,455
talked about all the characters, and gave our
overall thoughts. I give this movie three and

857
01:11:29,495 --> 01:11:35,800
a half stars. I liked it, it had its flaws,
but overall I think it had more going for it

858
01:11:35,841 --> 01:11:41,345
than against it, because I came away from the
theater noting that I had a really good time.

859
01:11:41,646 --> 01:11:45,829
I agree, yeah. I mean, I think that's a good
way of putting it. It did have more going for

860
01:11:45,849 --> 01:11:50,773
it than against it. I definitely didn't hate
the film, but also wasn't, you know, like some

861
01:11:50,813 --> 01:11:55,317
of the greater comic book films that we've kind
of become accustomed to recently. Yeah, not

862
01:11:55,337 --> 01:12:02,002
even close. But is it as close to being as good
as a Venom film as you can get? Maybe. I agree

863
01:12:02,042 --> 01:12:05,846
that if it was rated R, they had more language,
they had more violence, then it would have

864
01:12:05,866 --> 01:12:08,928
been. And maybe if it took somewhat more of
a horror route, I think that would have been

865
01:12:08,948 --> 01:12:13,003
a little bit more compelling. Yeah, for sure.
But for what we got, I had a blast. What's

866
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:16,385
your star rating? Also three and a half. All
right, that does it for the review. Go ahead

that goal, please. Alright, in our next episode

877
01:13:08,243 --> 01:13:13,327
we will be reviewing a Constantine animated
film that's coming out called City of Demons.

878
01:13:13,607 --> 01:13:18,491
Right. I think it was a web series that was
coming out on CW Seed, but it's being compiled,

879
01:13:18,551 --> 01:13:22,495
I think, into a full-length feature film here.
Yeah, and there's additional footage, there's

880
01:13:22,515 --> 01:13:27,559
like almost a half hour of additional footage
that wasn't seen in the web series. Yeah. And

881
01:13:27,579 --> 01:13:31,643
then, you know, CW is doing some big thing with
it later on in the month too. I think it's

882
01:13:31,683 --> 01:13:36,178
a way to kind of celebrate the fact that Matt
Ryan is going to... be joining the Legends

883
01:13:36,198 --> 01:13:41,000
of Tomorrow cast this season, which starts in
a few weeks as well. Yeah. So this is like

884
01:13:41,020 --> 01:13:44,981
a big Constantine month. Yeah. So we're going
to be reviewing that animated film and we're

885
01:13:45,021 --> 01:13:49,683
also going to be doing a dual episode with Constantine
versus Brother Voodoo later on this month,

886
01:13:49,723 --> 01:13:52,464
so look forward to that. Yeah, and if Daredevil
wasn't coming out, we also would have been

887
01:13:52,504 --> 01:13:55,965
reviewing the Keanu Reeves film, but I think
we'll save that for another time. Yeah, probably

888
01:13:56,005 --> 01:14:00,247
next Halloween time. Yeah. So yeah, that does
it for this episode. We'll talk to you guys

889
01:14:00,287 --> 01:14:02,288
in a week. Up, up, and away. True believers.
