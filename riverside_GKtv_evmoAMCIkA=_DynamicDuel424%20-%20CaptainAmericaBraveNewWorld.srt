00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,618 --> 00:00:29,862
Hi, welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,902 --> 00:00:35,847
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:36,207 --> 00:00:42,332
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous
Joe. And this past week was Valentine's Day,

5
00:00:42,632 --> 00:00:48,717
during which Marvel released its fourth Captain
America movie, Brave New World. And we're going

6
00:00:48,737 --> 00:00:53,141
to review it. This episode, did it live up to
the legacy of the previous Captain America

7
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:59,869
movies? The answer is yes. Yeah, man. Shit,
yeah. I believe you get your ass kicked for

8
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:05,072
saying something otherwise. I don't think it
did. Come at me, bro. You're on. We'll talk

9
00:01:05,092 --> 00:01:08,994
about the movie later on this episode. Before
that, we're gonna break down the latest comic

10
00:01:09,014 --> 00:01:14,617
book movie news to come out this past week.
Of which there was none. We got two big trailers

11
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:20,040
last week, so I guess I'm not surprised that
there's no real big news this week. But we

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,298
do have a no-price segment to get through, as
well as the review. And of course, we list

13
00:01:24,338 --> 00:01:28,200
our segment times in our episode description,
so feel free to check out the show notes if

00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:32,763
you want to skip ahead to a particular topic.

network this week, including Max destruction,
which pits your favorite action heroes from

26
00:02:31,141 --> 00:02:35,211
film and television against each other. This
Wednesday, hosts Scotty and Gilly are finding

27
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:41,535
out who would win in a fight between the MCU's
Thor and the DCEU's Black Adam. We said that

28
00:02:41,635 --> 00:02:46,478
that's what they were doing last week, but last
week they actually did MCU's Namor versus the

29
00:02:46,518 --> 00:02:52,322
DCEU Aquaman. It's actually pronounced Namor.
Yeah, you're right. On the Send Your World

30
00:02:52,362 --> 00:02:57,145
podcast, host Zachary Hepburn speculates on
fights between fan favorite anime and manga

31
00:02:57,185 --> 00:03:01,928
characters. Zach is on a brief season break
right now, but anime fans should check out

32
00:03:01,968 --> 00:03:07,031
his past library of episodes and look forward
to the huge episode he has in the works, an

33
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:14,035
epic 10 vs 10 team Naruto vs team bleach matchup.
And on the Konsole Kombat podcast hosts John

34
00:03:14,075 --> 00:03:18,858
and Dean simulate battles between popular video
game characters. In yesterday's episode, they

35
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:24,281
found out who'd win in a fight between Chun-Li
from Street Fighter and Lee-Mei from Mortal

36
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:29,812

with that out of the way, quick to the no prize.

38
00:03:37,676 --> 00:03:42,419
A no prize is an award Marvel used to give out
to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel No Prize,

39
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:47,101
is a digital award we post on Instagram for
the person that we feel gave the best answer

40
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:52,304
to our question of the week. Last week, we asked
you guys between the Fantastic Four teaser

41
00:03:52,624 --> 00:03:59,536
and the Thunderbolts big game trailer, which
got you more hyped and why? And actually we

42
00:03:59,576 --> 00:04:06,139
only got two actual answers for this question
this past week because I forgot to change the

43
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:10,822
question on our website. So a few people who
clicked on it answered last week's question.

44
00:04:11,082 --> 00:04:16,725
So shout out to By Dear Bangora and JP from
Quebec for giving their answer from last week.

45
00:04:16,745 --> 00:04:22,388
But this week's honorable mention goes to Mike
Williams, who said. On the movie I'm most interested

46
00:04:22,408 --> 00:04:28,595
in seeing due to the trailer is the Thunderbolts.
to see how they develop the Sentry and how

47
00:04:28,995 --> 00:04:34,098
the Void is headed toward being the villain
and how they're going to deal with that just

48
00:04:34,118 --> 00:04:39,580
being regular Joes and not super power the heroes
but as Marvel it'll be interesting. Thanks.

49
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:45,563
Yeah, the Thunderbolts big game trailer was
epic. It reveals that the primary villain of

50
00:04:45,603 --> 00:04:50,165
the Thunderbolts movie is going to be the Void
who is the dark alter ego of the character

51
00:04:50,485 --> 00:04:57,026
the Sentry. And I have no idea how this ragtag
cast of punchers and shooters is going to take

52
00:04:57,066 --> 00:05:03,051
down a character as powerful as The Void. But
I think that's one of the major draws of the

53
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:08,235
film itself. It's really this colorful cast
of misfit underdogs going up against these

54
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:13,700
unspeakable odds. Yeah, like how you described
it in our last episode. It's like the Suicide

55
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,863
Squad going up against Superman. And that's
a pretty damn good concept. Even though it

56
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:22,650
feels like they're ripping off DC, I'm still
excited to see the film. Yeah, for sure. Great

57
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:28,174
answer, Mike Williams. But the winner of this
week's snow prize is Lee Tapscott. With the

58
00:05:28,214 --> 00:05:34,559
consecutive win, he said, Hi, this is Lee about
the question. What am I more excited about?

59
00:05:34,599 --> 00:05:40,843
The Thunderbolts or the Fantastic Four? I think
it's going to be the Fantastic Four. Thunderbolts

60
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:48,108
feels like an end to the story. Tying up loose
ends while the Fantastic Four is the beginning

61
00:05:48,288 --> 00:05:56,225
of a new era for Marvel. something that isn't
tied down by past movies. So I think Fantastic

62
00:05:56,265 --> 00:06:00,447
Four, I'm looking forward to see what's new.
Yeah, I like this answer. The Fantastic Four

63
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:06,791
movie is gonna be the start of the MCU's phase
six of films, whereas, you know, the Thunderbolts

64
00:06:06,811 --> 00:06:12,818
is closing out phase five. And I think there's
something to be said for the... tone of the

65
00:06:12,858 --> 00:06:17,742
Fantastic Four movie and how it presents this
hopeful feel and the start of something new

66
00:06:17,882 --> 00:06:22,306
and unique and interesting in a way that the
Fantastic Four should. They were, you know,

67
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:28,331
the team that really kickstarted the Marvel
era of comic books in the 1960s. I think they

68
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:32,975
can reinvigorate the MCU in a way that other
franchises haven't been able to for a few years

69
00:06:33,015 --> 00:06:36,738
now. Yeah, I like this rationale and it's one
that I didn't even really consider because

70
00:06:36,758 --> 00:06:41,234
I've kind of lost track of the different phases
that are going on right now in the MCU. I could

71
00:06:41,274 --> 00:06:47,477
be wrong, but I believe the Thunderbolts also
ends the Bob Chapek era in Disney. So with

72
00:06:47,497 --> 00:06:52,659
the return of Bob Iger as the head of Disney,
we will hopefully see a return to form with

73
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:58,202
the MCU. I know that Phase 6 is going to focus
largely on the multiverse, since we're getting

74
00:06:58,222 --> 00:07:02,664
films like Fantastic Four, which takes place
in an alternate dimension. We're getting Avengers

75
00:07:02,704 --> 00:07:06,998
Doomsday. We're getting Avengers Secret Wars.
And we're getting the new Spider-Man film,

76
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:11,621
which I don't know if that involves the multiverse,
but at least three of the four films in Phase

77
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:16,643
6 will, that we know of so far. So great answer,
Lee! You win this week's No Prize if you the

78
00:07:16,663 --> 00:07:20,825
listener want a shot at winning your own No
Prize. Stay tuned to later on in the episode

79
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:25,388
when we'll be asking another question of the
week. And when you say later on in the episode,

80
00:07:25,408 --> 00:07:28,069
you mean like right now, right? That is correct!

81
00:07:32,578 --> 00:07:37,680
Since we're discussing the Captain America film
this episode, what is your favorite Captain

82
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:43,342
America solo film and why? Of course this includes
Captain America The First Avenger, Captain

83
00:07:43,382 --> 00:07:49,545
America The Winter Soldier, Captain America
Civil War, and Captain America Brave New World.

84
00:07:49,905 --> 00:07:55,288
And you know what? Let's throw in the Falcon
and the Winter Soldier television series and

85
00:07:55,368 --> 00:08:00,430
Black Widow since I think that movie is adjacent
to this franchise. And you know what, just

86
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:05,233
for shits and giggles, let's throw in the 90s
Captain America movie. Yeah, and the made for

87
00:08:05,253 --> 00:08:10,497
TV films in the 70s too. All the Captain America
stuff. What's your favorite and why? Record

93

question up on the website for everyone who
calls in.

94
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,894
With that out of the way, now let's move on
to the main event of our episode in which we

95
00:08:48,954 --> 00:08:55,521
review Marvel Studios' latest film to hit theaters,
Captain America Brave New World.

96
00:09:10,798 --> 00:09:16,680
Captain America Brave New World was directed
by Julius Ona and stars Anthony Mackey, Harrison

97
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:22,302
Ford, Tim Blake Nelson, and Danny Ramirez. It's
the penultimate film in the Marvel Cinematic

98
00:09:22,382 --> 00:09:27,965
Universe's Phase 5 of films and the first theatrical
return to the Captain America franchise in

99
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:34,447
nearly a decade since 2016's Captain America
Civil War. Since that film, the Avengers disassembled

100
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:39,934
and faced the threat of Thanos with Steve Rogers
retiring at the end of Endgame and passing

101
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:45,798
the mantle to the Falcon, aka Sam Wilson. This
is true to the comics when Steve Rogers once

102
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:50,561
had the super soldier serum in his body negated,
causing him to advance into old age and he

103
00:09:50,601 --> 00:09:56,225
passed his mantle onto his longtime partner,
the Falcon. In the MCU, it was really interesting

104
00:09:56,465 --> 00:10:01,808
watching Sam Wilson handle the idea of continuing
Steve Rogers' legacy in the Falcon and the

105
00:10:01,828 --> 00:10:07,148
Winter Soldier television series. where he ultimately
came to terms with the idea of taking on the

106
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:12,473
legacy and donning Captain America's shield.
The big question in this Brave New World film

107
00:10:12,533 --> 00:10:17,477
was, now that Sam's made his decision to be
the new Cap, would he be able to live up to

108
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:22,241
Steve's legacy? And it's a query that played
out not only in the cinematic world of the

109
00:10:22,341 --> 00:10:27,705
MCU, but also in real life as fans wondered
if this new movie would live up to the legacy

110
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:33,726
of Captain America's films that came before
it. And as far as I'm concerned, yeah. it did.

111
00:10:34,186 --> 00:10:38,367
If you haven't seen the film yet, I think that's
all you need to know for now, so I recommend

112
00:10:38,507 --> 00:10:43,308
seeing the movie, then coming back and listening
to our spoiler review. So here's your spoiler

113
00:10:43,328 --> 00:10:48,110
warning. Now I'm not going to say that Captain
America Brave New World was as good as either

114
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:52,811
Captain America The Winter Soldier or Captain
America Civil War, but I do think it was as

115
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:57,872
good, if not better, than the tangential film
in the Captain America franchise, which was

116
00:10:57,932 --> 00:11:03,418
Black Widow. If you listened to our review of
that film, we liked it. You know, we said Black

117
00:11:03,438 --> 00:11:07,321
Widow wasn't without its own problems, such
as taking liberties with the villains from

118
00:11:07,341 --> 00:11:13,165
the comics. But we also set ahead some great
action set pieces, a solid, thriller-y plot

119
00:11:13,285 --> 00:11:19,190
and meaningful characterization for the protagonists.
I feel the same here in that while Brave New

120
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:24,313
World couldn't quite reach the heights of the
very best MCU films, it is in itself a good

121
00:11:24,473 --> 00:11:30,157
film. And I think a lot of people, including
fatigued critics and audiences, are claiming

122
00:11:30,538 --> 00:11:35,181
that if a film can't be among the best, then
it's comparatively bad. And I think that's

123
00:11:35,201 --> 00:11:41,906
a mistake. I know we've stated this on the podcast
before that quality exists on a spectrum. Quality

124
00:11:41,926 --> 00:11:47,890
is not a pass fail concept. Even though platforms
like Rotten Tomatoes do actively push that.

125
00:11:48,251 --> 00:11:53,895
But like if you wanna see bad, see Howard the
Duck, see Catwoman, or literally any other

126
00:11:53,935 --> 00:12:00,439
DC movie for that matter. If you wanna see mediocre,
go see Venom or Iron Man 3. If you wanna see

127
00:12:00,499 --> 00:12:04,882
good, you know, see Captain America Brave New
World. And if you wanna see great, of course,

128
00:12:04,922 --> 00:12:09,865
go see like Logan or Avengers Infinity War,
but that's neither here nor there. I don't

129
00:12:09,885 --> 00:12:14,748
feel like I should have to say it, but near
perfect films are rare, but they aren't the

130
00:12:14,808 --> 00:12:19,531
only films worth seeing. I walked away from
the theater pleased with Brave New World's

131
00:12:19,591 --> 00:12:24,153
quality, and I don't think we could have asked
for a whole lot more than what we got here.

132
00:12:24,682 --> 00:12:29,484
I don't think I've heard anyone say that this
is a bad film. I've heard people say that it's

133
00:12:29,564 --> 00:12:33,987
low tier Marvel, which go watch Love and Thunder
if you wanna see low tier Marvel. That's fair.

134
00:12:34,027 --> 00:12:39,230
I think it's closer to low tier than it is to
high tier. I definitely think it's the worst

135
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:44,373
Captain America movie. That said, it's not a
bad movie. I think the comparison to Black

136
00:12:44,413 --> 00:12:49,736
Widow is fair, although I would even say that
Black Widow is slightly better in my opinion.

137
00:12:50,196 --> 00:12:55,275
Well, your opinion is trash. It's pure garbage.
I would actually rate Captain America Brave

138
00:12:55,315 --> 00:13:01,518
New World as, yeah sure, mid-tier, but closer
to top-tier than low-tier. I think one of the

139
00:13:01,618 --> 00:13:05,841
best things about Captain America Brave New
World is how it handles continuity in that

140
00:13:05,861 --> 00:13:12,244
it both resolves dangling plot threads from
the MCU and advances the overall plot of Earth's

141
00:13:12,284 --> 00:13:16,727
Mightiest Heroes in a meaningful way. Right,
it picked up the threads left in The Eternals

142
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:21,849
and The Incredible Hulk. Right. Yeah, like for
quite a while we've been saying that the biggest...

143
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:26,792
detriment to Marvel Studios right now is that
the film universe feels less cohesive than

144
00:13:26,832 --> 00:13:32,614
it's ever been, with tons of abandoned concepts,
unconnected characters, and loose threads that

145
00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:39,677
make things feel hard to keep up with for general
audiences. Commendably, Brave New World continues

146
00:13:39,717 --> 00:13:44,879
the story of Captain America and the Avengers,
and a little bit of the multiverse stuff regarding

147
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:48,841
the end credits stinger. But like you said regarding
The Incredible Hulk, this movie almost feels

148
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:54,115
like a quasi-sequel. to 2008's Incredible Hulk,
picking up one of the longest standing plot

149
00:13:54,135 --> 00:13:59,217
threads ever in regard to what happened to Samuel
Stearns, aka the leader, at the end of that

150
00:13:59,277 --> 00:14:04,879
movie. Brave New World also addresses, like
you said, the Eternals with that big ass celestial

151
00:14:04,899 --> 00:14:09,561
that rose from the planet's core, which has
been a question on a lot of our minds considering

152
00:14:09,902 --> 00:14:13,983
that big giant coming out of the earth hasn't
been addressed in any movies since the Eternals.

153
00:14:14,423 --> 00:14:20,638
Which is a huge fucking elephant in the room
to just gloss over. Right, right. So I appreciated

154
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:25,982
this movie for restoring some of that cohesiveness
in the MCU in that like yeah, it feels like

155
00:14:26,002 --> 00:14:30,245
things are starting to come together somewhat
and lead up to Phase Six and Avengers Doomsday

156
00:14:30,325 --> 00:14:35,829
and Secret Wars. However, despite cohearing
things up a little bit, the movie could still

157
00:14:35,869 --> 00:14:40,932
potentially lose some audiences I think who
don't remember plot points from films over

158
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:46,516
15 years ago, or who didn't know that Harrison
Ford is filling in for William Hurt who played

159
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:52,472
Thunderbolt or audiences who didn't watch The
Falcon and the Winter Soldier on Disney+. Like

160
00:14:52,772 --> 00:14:58,955
I bet there were a lot of people who were introduced
to Isaiah Bradley in this movie and were like,

161
00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:04,438
did I miss something? Like who the hell is this
guy? And why is Cap so motivated in helping

162
00:15:04,478 --> 00:15:10,842
him? I guarantee you that is 100% the case and
I theorize that's probably why a lot of audiences

163
00:15:10,922 --> 00:15:15,744
are responding to this film the way they are.
Like this film has the lowest cinema score

164
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:22,591
of any Marvel movie. in MCU history. Which is
fucking bananas. Yeah, I got a B minus. And

165
00:15:22,731 --> 00:15:27,872
I always have to guarantee you that it's because
people just have not been keeping up with Marvel.

166
00:15:28,272 --> 00:15:33,774
Yeah, the movie also has like a 52% on Rotten
Tomatoes, which pisses me off, frankly. I feel

167
00:15:33,794 --> 00:15:37,935
like going on a slapping spree with all the
dum-dums out there. This movie is not the worst

168
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:43,817
MCU movie that's ever come out. Sorry, that
goes to Thor, Love and Thunder. But like, you

169
00:15:43,837 --> 00:15:48,815
wanna tell audiences you don't know who Isaiah
Bradley is, That just means you didn't do your

170
00:15:48,855 --> 00:15:54,340
homework. So go get a Disney Plus subscription
and watch the six episode Falcon and the Winter

171
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,424
Soldier series and pay attention to Isaiah's
backstory, you son of a bitch, then come back

172
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:06,611
and re-watch Brave New World with that context.
I don't wanna do homework, fuck that. It is

173
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:11,816
a lot to ask. I also think like a lot of the
audience is probably like, am I supposed to

174
00:16:11,856 --> 00:16:16,539
know this Samuel Sterns character? You know,
because he does look different than he did

175
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:22,061
in The Incredible Hulk, considering he has that
gamma brain now. Even my wife, who has seen

176
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:26,423
The Incredible Hulk like three times, still
didn't remember Tim Blake Nelson's character.

177
00:16:26,823 --> 00:16:31,065
Well, it's a lot because Samuel Sterns looks
different. Thunderbolt Ross looks different.

178
00:16:31,385 --> 00:16:36,867
Even the actor who played the Hulk in that movie
is different. That's true. That's true. The

179
00:16:36,907 --> 00:16:42,289
only one who came back was Liv Tyler in the
barest of cameos. Right. These like type of

180
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:47,311
Easter egg. callback elements are definitely
rewarding for the fans. And not even all the

181
00:16:47,411 --> 00:16:51,992
fans, like I would say the fans with good memories,
you know. So I just think Marvel's gonna continue

182
00:16:52,032 --> 00:16:57,193
to see diminishing returns on these types of
things solely because their continuity is approaching

183
00:16:57,413 --> 00:17:02,995
20 years now. And you know, it's not the worst
problem to have. DC would love to have this

184
00:17:03,015 --> 00:17:08,837
kind of problem, but it is still a problem.
I don't want Marvel's problems, ugh. Better

185
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:13,938
than DC's problems. Hey, we don't have any problems
right now, bro. We're just starting out. I

186
00:17:13,978 --> 00:17:19,700
did really like the action of this movie from
the Oaxaca fight to the Sidewinder Street battle.

187
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,341
The Echo One prison fight was pretty good and
especially the aerial battle above Celestial

188
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:29,942
Island. And, you know, the Red Hulk standoff
was pretty good, too. I think one of the best

189
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:36,704
things about Sam Wilson as the Falcon and as
now Captain America, and I feel like people

190
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:42,318
don't recognize this enough, is that how thrilling
it is to see him in action. in his wingsuit.

191
00:17:42,819 --> 00:17:47,262
Yeah, Sam's not as impressive a fighter as Steve
Rogers. You know, his ground combat can't match

192
00:17:47,623 --> 00:17:53,508
Steve's fight against like Batroc or, you know,
even Shang-Chi's martial arts prowess. But

193
00:17:53,548 --> 00:17:59,033
in the sky, Sam Wilson's like, wow, like I'll
be damned if his aerial dogfights aren't a

194
00:17:59,093 --> 00:18:03,717
sight to behold. It's basically the best thing
about the character and it's unique to his

195
00:18:03,757 --> 00:18:08,976
character as well. Yeah, I didn't love the action
in this film. I've seen a lot of people say

196
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:13,879
that the choreography was pretty slow, and I
would agree. That said, I don't know if that

197
00:18:13,899 --> 00:18:19,122
was a conscious choice made on behalf of the
filmmakers and the editing room to emphasize

198
00:18:19,142 --> 00:18:23,844
the fact that Sam is not a super soldier, but
I would definitely say it was a noticeable

199
00:18:23,924 --> 00:18:28,767
downgrade from other Captain America films.
They definitely made it clear, intentionally

200
00:18:28,787 --> 00:18:33,554
or not, within the course of this film, that
things are more difficult for Sam. You know,

201
00:18:33,594 --> 00:18:39,656
he doesn't have the super soldier serum. It
does take more effort on his part to try to

202
00:18:39,896 --> 00:18:45,018
be Captain America. That said, he does seem
to have a superpower of being able to get stabbed

203
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:50,721
in the torso however many times he wants and
still keep going. It was really only like three

204
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:57,123
times. It was like six times. What? Yeah. You
got stabbed with like an axe, a knife, like

205
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:02,385
something had to hit some kind of organ. Those
things were deep. Band-aids are a thing. OK.

206
00:19:03,282 --> 00:19:08,826
Anti-bacterial cream, Neosporin is a thing.
Just throw some Vicks on that. There you go.

207
00:19:09,386 --> 00:19:13,809
Now, I've maintained that the Falcons dogfight
in the Falcon and the Winter Soldier television

208
00:19:13,829 --> 00:19:19,053
series in Tunisia, that opening action scene,
it's really one of Marvel's best action scenes

209
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:24,737
in anything that they've ever produced ever.
Oh, yeah. And Sam's dogfight here near Celestial

210
00:19:24,857 --> 00:19:28,960
Island. I thought that was fucking awesome,
too. Not as good as the Tunisia fight, I would

211
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:33,715
argue. But yeah, still not terrible. It harkened
back to like the Iron Man aerial battles that

212
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:40,358
I loved watching. Yeah, from Iron Man one. Yeah,
I think the Celestial Island dogfight was the

213
00:19:40,478 --> 00:19:46,680
actual action climax of the film, because although
the fight against Red Hulk wasn't bad, it just

214
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:52,923
wasn't as much in Sam Wilson's element. That's
not to say I didn't like the end fight. I actually

215
00:19:52,963 --> 00:19:57,665
really liked how Cap just absolutely didn't
fucking stand a chance against Red Hulk, so

216
00:19:57,705 --> 00:20:03,600
it was more about. survival and you know appealing
to Red Hulk's emotional state. Yeah I've joked

217
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:09,363
on the discord that Sam Wilson's superpower
is seemingly therapy. He has therapy powers

218
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:14,086
because that's how he finished the whole because
that's how he finished the Red Hulk in this

219
00:20:14,106 --> 00:20:21,070
climactic end battle. It was kind of anti-climactic.
In a way but Sam does have counselor powers

220
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:25,573
you know when he met Steve Rogers in the MCU
he was a trauma counselor for veterans. It's

221
00:20:25,593 --> 00:20:31,860
a big part of his character. to approach conflict
with reason before fists. Like if you look

222
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:36,142
at the Falcon and the Winter Soldier series,
there was that moment where he nearly talked

223
00:20:36,382 --> 00:20:43,045
Flag Smasher into giving up her whole agenda
before that dumb ass John Walker US agent barged

224
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:50,068
in. And I will say that's a great aspect of
the Sam Wilson character, who is a great longstanding

225
00:20:50,108 --> 00:20:55,738
character in the MCU with that great history.
That said, it's not a very cinematic, quote

226
00:20:55,758 --> 00:21:00,160
unquote, superpower. And I was left kind of
disappointed by the end battle with the Red

227
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:06,341
Hulk, just de powering himself after looking
at a cherry blossom petal in his palm. Come

228
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:11,323
on. It was poetic, man. It was that was poetry.
Yeah. What are you talking about? No, I didn't

229
00:21:11,343 --> 00:21:18,545
like it. It was vaguely reminiscent of how the
big climactic Hulk versus army fight ended

230
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:25,328
in the 2003 Ang Lee Hulk movie. when Betty showed
up and it calmed Hulk down enough to revert

231
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:30,492
to his human form. It also happened in the 2008
Incredible Hulk film during the campus fight

232
00:21:30,852 --> 00:21:35,795
when Betty showed up he protected her from the
crashing helicopter and then like jumped away

233
00:21:35,815 --> 00:21:41,119
with her. She's kind of been this calming influence
on these climactic battles and although she

234
00:21:41,139 --> 00:21:46,162
didn't technically show up during this end fight,
you know, her name was evoked and the Red Hulk

235
00:21:46,182 --> 00:21:51,550
had a good enough tangible memento of her to
think about his daughter enough. turn back

236
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:56,052
into his human form. I do think that the film
did a good job of continuing the political

237
00:21:56,092 --> 00:22:00,515
thriller aspect that has become a staple of
the Captain America franchise, starting with

238
00:22:00,555 --> 00:22:05,578
The Winter Soldier. You know, in that first
sequel, all the paranoia came from not knowing

239
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:11,061
who was a bad guy because Hydra had infiltrated
SHIELD. In the Black Widow movie, the paranoia

240
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:15,884
came from not knowing when Taskmaster or one
of the stealthy mind-controlled Black Widows

241
00:22:15,904 --> 00:22:21,279
would attack. And in Brave New World... The
paranoia came from not knowing who was unknowingly

242
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:26,281
a mind control agent of the leader. You actually
notice quite a few similarities between this

243
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:31,403
film and The Winter Soldier, that being one
of them. I think this tried pretty hard to

244
00:22:31,543 --> 00:22:36,425
recapture that same political thriller magic
as The Winter Soldier. I don't think it was

245
00:22:36,585 --> 00:22:41,287
as successful, but there was that and there
was also the scene of, you know, Captain America

246
00:22:41,307 --> 00:22:46,649
and his sidekick going into that deep basement
where there was that secret villain there.

247
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:52,239
Are you referring to Steve Rogers and Natasha
Romanoff going into Camp Lehigh and finding

248
00:22:52,459 --> 00:22:56,840
Arnim Zola? Yes, yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah. And
then there was also, of course, the machine

249
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:01,582
gun battle on the streets between Winter Soldier
and Cap. Yeah, I will say that Julius Ona,

250
00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:07,403
the director, is not at the level of the Russo
brothers. I would definitely agree with that

251
00:23:07,463 --> 00:23:12,585
100%. Which is not saying much, I don't think,
because, you know, the Russo brothers directed

252
00:23:12,645 --> 00:23:17,099
Infinity War and Endgame. And they're pretty
much... at the top of their league when it

253
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:21,863
comes to these superhero films. I think the
subpar direction in this film was noticeable.

254
00:23:22,103 --> 00:23:27,348
I also think the budget on this film was noticeable.
This film was only made for one hundred and

255
00:23:27,469 --> 00:23:32,734
eighty million dollars, which by Marvel standards
is pretty cheap. Like the film is already going

256
00:23:32,754 --> 00:23:37,498
to make its budget back with this four day holiday
weekend. Yeah, which is badass. I think it

257
00:23:37,538 --> 00:23:42,642
made just under two hundred million dollars
worldwide. I mean, it's still making less than

258
00:23:42,682 --> 00:23:47,586
something like quantumania. We'll see what the
second week drop is for this film. If it compares

259
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:52,629
to as devastating a drop as quantumania had.
But yeah, to me, that's still not that big

260
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:56,312
of a feat, because to me, it just says that
the movie was really cheap. And there was a

261
00:23:56,412 --> 00:24:01,075
lot of shots where you could see that was the
case. Jonathan, what DC movie made its entire

262
00:24:01,135 --> 00:24:04,997
budget back in the opening weekend? I don't
keep track of this shit. I just read this.

263
00:24:05,017 --> 00:24:09,581
This is how I know. Let me go back and find
out. How about none of them, except for maybe

264
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:13,307
the Batman? You don't know that. I can see that
happening. But let's go ahead and get into

265
00:24:13,327 --> 00:24:18,751
our character breakdown, starting with Captain
America, aka Sam Wilson, played by Anthony

266
00:24:18,811 --> 00:24:22,994
Mackie. I really like Anthony Mackie as an actor.
We've talked about him before. You know, he's

267
00:24:23,014 --> 00:24:28,518
a really well-trained alumni of Juilliard. There's
really nothing he can't do performance-wise.

268
00:24:28,838 --> 00:24:32,521
So it kind of makes me wish that they would
actually do more with the character of Sam

269
00:24:32,561 --> 00:24:37,184
Wilson to have Anthony Mackie show more of his
range, like really put him through the wrinker

270
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:42,211
emotionally. But I think that Mackie... definitely
showed he has the presence to lead his own

271
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:47,416
film as Captain America. I think he proved that
here. Yeah, like I said, Sam Wilson is a great

272
00:24:47,456 --> 00:24:53,101
character. I don't think he quite has the presence
and charisma of Chris Evans' Steve Rogers,

273
00:24:53,581 --> 00:24:58,205
but I'm not going to say that Anthony Mackie
is a bad actor because he is phenomenal, especially

274
00:24:58,245 --> 00:25:03,910
as Sam. His main motivation in this movie was
to exonerate Isaiah Bradley from prison, a

275
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:08,866
man who he knew spent most of his life already
wrongfully incarcerated. and who was a big

276
00:25:09,086 --> 00:25:15,871
influence in his decision to take up the shield.
This go-round was less about Sam proving himself

277
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:20,774
worthy like it was in the Falcon and the Winter
Soldier series, but this was more about doing

278
00:25:20,794 --> 00:25:26,298
what he thought was right by the people around
him as Captain America does. Albeit, you know,

279
00:25:26,438 --> 00:25:31,261
without the super soldier serum, which was a
big part of his arc in that as he tells Joaquin

280
00:25:31,301 --> 00:25:35,384
at the end of the movie, when you're normal,
you just have to try that much harder, be under

281
00:25:35,424 --> 00:25:40,352
that much more pressure, and push yourself.
to be almost perfect in order to carry that

282
00:25:40,392 --> 00:25:46,397
mantle, to stand shoulder to shoulder with Norse
gods and Jade giants. You know, that kind of

283
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:52,222
thing seemed effortless for Steve Rogers, but
to continue his legacy, you know, you do what

284
00:25:52,242 --> 00:25:57,827
you have to do. I really like that, and I think
it's inspiring to the everyman. Like you don't

285
00:25:57,927 --> 00:26:03,312
need a super soldier serum to be a hero. You
just need to strive for your best self. And

286
00:26:03,352 --> 00:26:08,367
a jet pack doesn't hurt. Yeah, jet pack. with
vibranium wings that can absorb kinetic energy

287
00:26:08,387 --> 00:26:13,451
and then release it explosively, that also does
not hurt. Can I say that I understand the reasoning

288
00:26:13,611 --> 00:26:19,775
of why they gave him the vibranium kinetic absorption
wings, but I also just hated that he had those?

289
00:26:20,696 --> 00:26:26,940
I agree, I totally agree actually. You know,
in the comic books, the wings were a gift from

290
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,845
Black Panther, but the whole kinetic absorption
and releasing was really unique to the character

291
00:26:33,865 --> 00:26:39,656
of Black Panther. And I think that giving that
ability to Sam Wilson kind of makes Black Panther

292
00:26:39,736 --> 00:26:44,558
less unique, right? I don't think he needed
him. I think he was cool enough without that.

293
00:26:44,618 --> 00:26:48,800
Even like at the very beginning with the opening
action scene, which in my opinion was the best

294
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:53,982
action scene in the film with the sonic boom,
that was so cool. Yeah, that sonic boom was

295
00:26:54,043 --> 00:26:58,985
fucking bad ass. I mean, the vibranium does
explain why he can do a straight nose dive

296
00:26:59,045 --> 00:27:04,599
from, you know. 3000 feet in the air onto the
ground without breaking his ankles or turning

297
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:10,000
into a pile of jelly because you have that absorption
I didn't mind that I am wondering what kind

298
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:14,502
of upgrades they're gonna give the Black Panther
suit the next time we see him though Or her

299
00:27:14,682 --> 00:27:20,504
as Shuri in order to make Black Panther just
that much cooler, right? It's not like everything

300
00:27:20,524 --> 00:27:25,465
that's vibranium needs to have that same kind
of kinetic discharge. It's not like cap shield

301
00:27:25,505 --> 00:27:30,504
ever had that Exactly, exactly. It was something
that was a unique technology that Shuri developed

302
00:27:30,844 --> 00:27:36,488
that she incorporated into Black Panther's costume.
And then it seems later on into Falcon's costume.

303
00:27:36,748 --> 00:27:42,292
What did you think of the blue suits compared
to his white suit? Personally, I actually like

304
00:27:42,352 --> 00:27:46,895
Sam Wilson's white suit more because I think
it pops more visually and it's more accurate

305
00:27:47,316 --> 00:27:51,939
to his longstanding Captain America costume
from the comic books. All right. I'm indifferent.

306
00:27:51,959 --> 00:27:56,530
I don't know. I am really glad, though, that
they ditched the awkward cowl. from the Falcon

307
00:27:56,550 --> 00:28:01,991
and the Winter Soldier series, which was a good
call, yeah. The blue suit works too. You know,

308
00:28:02,031 --> 00:28:06,512
the Wakandans, they have good fashion sense,
obviously. Let's go ahead and move on to Red

309
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:13,674
Hulk, AKA Thaddeus Thunderbolt Ross, who was
played by Harrison Ford. Now I am not about

310
00:28:13,714 --> 00:28:18,496
to shit on a legend like Harrison Ford. You
know, the guy is fucking Han Solo and Indiana

311
00:28:18,536 --> 00:28:23,817
Jones and his influence on these genre films
in sci-fi, adventure, and even political thriller

312
00:28:24,037 --> 00:28:31,487
as Jack Ryan. can't be understated. The guy
is an icon. That said, I kept wondering how

313
00:28:31,847 --> 00:28:35,971
his lines would have been delivered by William
Hurt, who really came to define the role of

314
00:28:36,011 --> 00:28:41,195
Thunderbolt Ross for me through films like The
Incredible Hulk and Captain America Civil War

315
00:28:41,356 --> 00:28:47,141
and briefly in Infinity War. No, I agree 100%.
Honestly, this film, as much as I hate to say

316
00:28:47,181 --> 00:28:52,165
this, kind of made me wish that Harrison Ford
was cast as the character from the get-go.

317
00:28:52,734 --> 00:28:57,616
Yeah, yeah, because I don't think he was bad
as Thunderbolt Ross. He certainly was a different

318
00:28:57,676 --> 00:29:02,719
kind of Thunderbolt Ross, you know, a little
bit less intense, I think, than William Hurt,

319
00:29:02,739 --> 00:29:07,262
maybe a little bit more grounded. At times,
it kind of seemed like Harrison Ford was winking

320
00:29:07,282 --> 00:29:12,605
at the camera in a self-aware sense in his performance.
But I really think he sold the more vulnerable

321
00:29:12,745 --> 00:29:17,068
aspects of Thunderbolt Ross, especially when
it came to Betty, like when she called him

322
00:29:17,548 --> 00:29:22,503
and when she visited him in the raft, like.
Harrison Ford's performance almost had me in

323
00:29:22,523 --> 00:29:28,086
tears at those points. I suppose it was definitely
a much more sentimental version of the character

324
00:29:28,126 --> 00:29:34,249
than we've seen in the past. And it kind of
took me by surprise. I didn't love his arc,

325
00:29:34,269 --> 00:29:39,012
I would say. There was one scene that he got
in this movie that I thought was like truly

326
00:29:39,072 --> 00:29:43,914
explosive, like William Hurt's version of the
character, like the comic book character. And

327
00:29:43,954 --> 00:29:50,730
that was during the newsreel that was played
at the beginning of the movie. about Thunderbolt's

328
00:29:50,851 --> 00:29:56,675
transition from being a general into a president.
And we got this clip of Thunderbolt Ross with

329
00:29:56,735 --> 00:30:02,020
the mustache. And he threw down this podium.
And I don't know if you're like trying to lip

330
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,382
read what he was saying, but I was laughing
my ass off because he was like, I don't know

331
00:30:05,402 --> 00:30:10,867
what the fuck you're talking about. And just
seeing Harrison Ford kind of chew the scenery,

332
00:30:11,247 --> 00:30:14,550
it seemed like he was ad libbing with all these
curse words and shit. It was hilarious. I was

333
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:21,018
laughing. I swore and I saw him say stupid fucking
question. Yeah, I think that was what he said.

334
00:30:21,198 --> 00:30:26,202
That was great. He looked great there. I kind
of wish he would have kept the mustache. Yeah,

335
00:30:26,362 --> 00:30:30,365
but you know, Red Hulk doesn't have a mustache,
so they had to lose it for the movie, I guess.

336
00:30:30,385 --> 00:30:37,189
And I think that's a mistake, too. Red Hulk
needs the stash. You think? Absolutely. He

337
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:42,933
has it currently in the comic book, so who knows?
The Red Hulk was not entirely what I expected

338
00:30:42,973 --> 00:30:48,357
in this movie. You know, he wasn't 100% faithful
to the comics. You know, he didn't retain Ross's

339
00:30:48,397 --> 00:30:52,852
mind. I couldn't really make out whether or
not he actually had his heat powers. Like there

340
00:30:52,873 --> 00:30:57,056
were times where Hila would like a grab a car
and it was on fire, but it wasn't clear whether

341
00:30:57,096 --> 00:31:02,961
or not the car was on fire because of his heat
powers. Like I remember Ross sweating during

342
00:31:03,001 --> 00:31:07,745
his transformations, but that could also be
rationalized that it wasn't due to him being

343
00:31:07,845 --> 00:31:12,349
hot. It was like due to the stress. I didn't
get the impression that he had his heat powers

344
00:31:12,389 --> 00:31:16,892
in this movie. I think they tried to do homages
to that of sorts in this film, like having

345
00:31:16,912 --> 00:31:21,896
him surrounded by fire. But yeah, I felt like
we were kind of cheated of that, especially

346
00:31:21,937 --> 00:31:26,060
because in one of the trailers, when his hand
is turning into the Hulk's, like it leaves

347
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,645
this trail of like burning ash. And that was
cut from the film. Yeah, I didn't appreciate

348
00:31:30,685 --> 00:31:35,850
that. Maybe they thought that it would require
exposition on behalf of general audiences.

349
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:39,673
So they just decided to leave it on the cutting
room floor. But I think that was a mistake,

350
00:31:39,693 --> 00:31:43,537
because if he doesn't have his heat powers,
then literally he's just a palette swapped

351
00:31:43,557 --> 00:31:48,090
version of the Hulk. You should have 100% gone
that route. And this film had so much exposition

352
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:52,992
anyway, all it would have taken was a single
line to justify it. This film actually turned

353
00:31:53,072 --> 00:31:57,153
out completely different from how I thought
it was going to turn out because I thought

354
00:31:57,353 --> 00:32:02,354
they were introducing adamantium because later
on in this film, the leader was gonna use it

355
00:32:02,394 --> 00:32:06,516
in some way to become a leader of the world.
And that the only thing that was going to take

356
00:32:06,556 --> 00:32:12,457
down his muscle was an adamantium weapon considering
its high melting point. It was something that

357
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:16,870
could defeat the Hulk. without him melting it.
You were reading way too much into the adamantium

358
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:21,812
thing than was necessary. Adamantium is not
that big of a plot point within this film and

359
00:32:21,832 --> 00:32:26,493
it didn't need to be. Should have been. I don't
think your ideas of what could have made this

360
00:32:26,553 --> 00:32:32,235
movie better detracts from the quality of the
film as it exists. Now that's not the claim

361
00:32:32,255 --> 00:32:36,976
you've made in past reviews because you've said
that if you could imagine a film can be better

362
00:32:37,296 --> 00:32:42,274
or more closer to the comics or something like
that, then you degrade that film. Because if

363
00:32:42,314 --> 00:32:47,156
someone like you could come up with this great
idea and the writers couldn't, it shows that

364
00:32:47,196 --> 00:32:51,598
the film could have been better, should have
been better, but it just wasn't. Yeah, I do

365
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:56,800
that for bad films for which it's necessary.
This is one of those films. This is absolutely

366
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,802
one of those films. This is not a bad film.
Could have been better. It didn't need to be

367
00:33:00,822 --> 00:33:06,484
done. That's like saying, oh yeah, then Bruce
Banner shows up and fights the Red Hulk alongside

368
00:33:06,524 --> 00:33:10,798
Captain America. It's like, sure, yeah, you
can say that. But there are definitely reasons

369
00:33:10,898 --> 00:33:15,362
why these choices were made for this particular
film, which happened to be good. Yeah, budget.

370
00:33:15,862 --> 00:33:20,545
No, I don't think so. Absolutely. No, it was
important for Sam Wilson to stand up to the

371
00:33:20,585 --> 00:33:25,569
Red Hulk on his own. I think it was a defining
moment for the character's growth and career.

372
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:29,592
I think if they could have afforded Mark Ruffalo
for this film, they could have brought him

373
00:33:29,612 --> 00:33:32,794
on. They would have brought him on. I don't
think they would have. He's not necessary for

374
00:33:32,814 --> 00:33:36,677
the story that they're trying to tell here.
Let's go ahead and move on to the leader, played

375
00:33:36,697 --> 00:33:41,852
by Tim Blank Nelson. Now if you remember from
our Incredible Hulk review, I'm a fan of Tim

376
00:33:41,872 --> 00:33:47,276
Blake Nelson as an actor but I did not enjoy
his performance as Samuel Stearns in that movie.

377
00:33:47,696 --> 00:33:54,081
Thankfully, none of his character's cartoonish
dopiness survived his time in prison apparently

378
00:33:54,141 --> 00:33:59,384
because he was much more subdued here and cunning
and more of what I hoped for from a criminal

379
00:33:59,424 --> 00:34:06,368
mastermind like the leader. His power set was
largely depicted in his near precognitive ability

380
00:34:06,408 --> 00:34:11,371
to determine the probabilistic outcomes of events,
which I think is more believable with this

381
00:34:11,411 --> 00:34:17,875
character than with characters like Baron Zemo
or Lex Luthor, where they were almost precognitive

382
00:34:17,915 --> 00:34:23,478
in their ability to manipulate events in Captain
America Civil War and Batman vs Superman Dawn

383
00:34:23,498 --> 00:34:29,621
of Justice. You know, here, the leader is like
a gamma-irradiated mutate, and he should have

384
00:34:29,826 --> 00:34:36,030
borderline precognitive abilities to determine
events. He also developed neurotropic mind

385
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:42,674
control technology and medicinal yet gamma irradiated
drugs. I thought it was a pretty sufficient

386
00:34:42,714 --> 00:34:48,178
demonstration of his power potential and I was
pleased with his characterization. I do really,

387
00:34:48,258 --> 00:34:52,901
really like what they did with the leader here.
I don't love his motivation, it seemed kind

388
00:34:52,941 --> 00:34:57,905
of petty, but everything else I loved from the
way they interpreted his mind control to the

389
00:34:58,005 --> 00:35:03,927
look of the character. I thought was stellar.
Yeah, yeah, regarding his motivation, I was

390
00:35:03,987 --> 00:35:09,388
wondering, like, why was he so angry and vengeful
with Thunderbolt Ross for not releasing him

391
00:35:09,428 --> 00:35:14,470
from prison when he could have seemingly so
easily escaped on his own at any time? Like,

392
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:20,691
he had mind control tech, and we saw him escape
prison in this movie. He could have easily

393
00:35:20,731 --> 00:35:25,293
done that and arranged for Ross to be killed
once he was on the outside, with probably a

394
00:35:25,353 --> 00:35:30,586
much less convoluted plan than what he had here.
You know, yes, he wanted Ross to suffer and

395
00:35:30,626 --> 00:35:36,128
to be humiliated. And that was definitely his
downfall in this movie because it just got

396
00:35:36,188 --> 00:35:41,690
way too complicated. And I think a guy as smart
as the leader wouldn't have needed to wait

397
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:46,311
to be released by President Ross in the first
place. It also didn't make sense to me why

398
00:35:46,351 --> 00:35:51,332
he literally turned himself in at the end. Like,
the Falcon didn't even need to defeat him.

399
00:35:51,632 --> 00:35:57,054
He turned himself in for no reason. For sure.
For sure. Absolutely no reason. You know, he

400
00:35:57,075 --> 00:36:02,318
was upset with Sam for stopping his grand plan
at Celestial Island But like he didn't need

401
00:36:02,358 --> 00:36:05,580
to confront the guy face to face, you know He
could have just given him a phone call and

402
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:11,143
been like fuck you my plan isn't over There's
still things to come for President Ross and

403
00:36:11,283 --> 00:36:15,365
you'll see in a moment, you know Yeah, yeah
still leaked the phone call and everything

404
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:21,709
so dumb so dumb again that said I don't want
to shit on the character Too much the writing

405
00:36:21,729 --> 00:36:26,266
was bad but the character I thought was awesome.
The character was what Hector Hammond should

406
00:36:26,286 --> 00:36:30,988
have been in the Green Lantern movie. Yeah,
I mean, like regarding his look, they could

407
00:36:31,008 --> 00:36:35,609
have easily gone the giant forehead route that
they did in the Green Lantern movie with Hector

408
00:36:35,649 --> 00:36:39,130
Hammond. I'm really glad that they didn't do
that though, because I've always been a fan

409
00:36:39,710 --> 00:36:44,591
of the inside out brain look of the leader more
than the giant forehead look, which I think

410
00:36:44,631 --> 00:36:49,653
looks kind of cartoonish and dopey. Although,
you know, sometimes with the inside out brain

411
00:36:49,693 --> 00:36:54,802
look, the artists will render their brain hemispheres
too far apart and it looks like he has a wrinkly

412
00:36:54,842 --> 00:36:59,964
green scrotum on his head. But I think what
they did here with the character in his design

413
00:37:00,205 --> 00:37:05,707
was pretty grounded and definitely not cartoony.
So that was good. It was kind of grotesque,

414
00:37:05,727 --> 00:37:10,529
you know? Yeah, for sure. And if I haven't said
this, Tim Blake Nelson is a phenomenal actor.

415
00:37:10,789 --> 00:37:14,751
I love what he did with the character here.
And I actually do hope we get to see the character

416
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:18,932
return. I'm actually glad they didn't kill him
off in this film. Yeah, me too. I want to see

417
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:22,962
Bruce Banner interact with him. Oh, yeah. Yeah,
that'd be awesome. Let's go ahead and move

418
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:28,484
on to Falcon, aka Joaquin Torres, played by
Danny Ramirez. I thought Danny Ramirez was

419
00:37:28,524 --> 00:37:32,806
fine here. As we saw in the Falcon and the Winter
Soldier series, you know, he's a charismatic

420
00:37:32,886 --> 00:37:38,008
actor, if not still growing as an actor, I think.
But in most ways, he was the heart of this

421
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:42,990
film, in that he really looked up to these heroes
like we all do, and strived to be like them,

422
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:47,112
and was really down on himself when he didn't
rise to the occasion. I thought this character

423
00:37:47,192 --> 00:37:52,511
sucked. What? The actor, I don't think, did
a good enough job. keeping up with the performances

424
00:37:52,891 --> 00:37:57,915
of the people he was on the scenes with. His
dialogue was just terrible as well. I thought

425
00:37:57,935 --> 00:38:01,678
he had some fun moments. Like at the beginning
of the film when he was like super excited

426
00:38:01,698 --> 00:38:05,982
that he retrieved the adamantium container and
he was like, what? No one, no one saw that?

427
00:38:06,342 --> 00:38:11,507
Dumb. Like to do something that cool and have
no witnesses, I think I would feel pretty similarly.

428
00:38:12,007 --> 00:38:16,931
It was silly. It was silly nonsense. Marvel
trying to be funny with the comedy relief.

429
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:21,602
It was just not good though. I thought it was
funny. But the character was never so ingratiating

430
00:38:21,642 --> 00:38:25,583
that I thought he was beyond being killed off
or anything. I thought that was good. That

431
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:29,645
there were still some stakes there. Because
for a second I thought he actually was dead

432
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:36,747
after the missile explosion. And my mind was
like, that would suck. So I think my feelings

433
00:38:36,807 --> 00:38:40,968
in that moment kind of informed my feelings
for the character overall. I'm glad he survived

434
00:38:41,008 --> 00:38:46,578
and I'm excited to see where he goes in the
next Avengers film. I wish he was dead. I just

435
00:38:46,618 --> 00:38:50,761
hope that they don't splice him with Falcon
DNA like they did in the comic books. You know,

436
00:38:50,821 --> 00:38:54,303
they could have done that in this movie where
his body was so mangled from the explosion

437
00:38:54,323 --> 00:38:59,807
that they had an infused Falcon DNA in there.
He just gets bitten by a radioactive Falcon.

438
00:39:00,227 --> 00:39:06,192
There you go. No, I didn't need this character.
I would have much rather seen Falcon have like

439
00:39:06,372 --> 00:39:12,236
a romantic interest type sidekick in the same
way that Cap did in the Winter Soldier. Who

440
00:39:12,296 --> 00:39:17,427
is his romantic sidekick? Sharon Carter? Well,
there is Sharon Carter and Black Widow. Yeah,

441
00:39:18,308 --> 00:39:24,413
I guess in this movie, Ruth Batsaraf definitely
did not fit that bill. Let's talk about her,

442
00:39:24,673 --> 00:39:31,418
AKA Sabra, although they never called her Sabra
here, played by Shirah Haas. Really weird casting

443
00:39:31,458 --> 00:39:36,161
choice, in my opinion. For sure. Like, I've
never seen Shirah Haas in anything before,

444
00:39:36,702 --> 00:39:41,085
but I was not a fan. Like, I didn't find her
believable at all as a former black widow trained

445
00:39:41,105 --> 00:39:47,142
by the Red Room. I'm fairly certain that her
5'2", 100 pound soaking wet ass couldn't take

446
00:39:47,162 --> 00:39:53,066
down a toddler. I'm not entirely sure that wasn't
a toddler on the screen. She was so tiny. Dude,

447
00:39:53,106 --> 00:39:58,651
seriously, they got like a fourth grader to
be your stunt double. I'm being harsh for sure,

448
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:02,794
but like, I don't know, I've never been a biggest
fan of Sabra from the comic books and I didn't

449
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:06,297
really like this character in the film. I think
it would have been cooler to see someone like

450
00:40:06,317 --> 00:40:10,701
Valerie Cooper in this role because I think
she'd get a tie it into the X-Men down the

451
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:16,772
line or something. Valerie Cooper, who's that?
She's like a longstanding governmental liaison

452
00:40:16,952 --> 00:40:22,756
in the comics dealing with superhuman, largely
mutant affairs. If I was the filmmakers, I

453
00:40:22,776 --> 00:40:28,058
would have just merged the characters of Sam
Wilson's Secret Service agent friend and Sabra

454
00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:32,421
into one character. That would actually make
sense. Yeah, the Secret Service friend of his

455
00:40:32,461 --> 00:40:37,864
was named Lila Taylor, and she's a reporter
for the Daily Bugle in the books. Also Sam

456
00:40:37,904 --> 00:40:43,943
Wilson's friend. She's like his Lois Lane, kinda.
She like breaks stories and gets into trouble

457
00:40:43,963 --> 00:40:48,686
and stuff like that. I thought she did a better
job acting than Shira Haas did. I would agree.

458
00:40:49,127 --> 00:40:53,349
Yeah, I think that's a good call to have those
two characters merged because then you could

459
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:57,152
have had like a romantic relationship too as
well. There you go. If she was given more screen

460
00:40:57,192 --> 00:41:02,775
time. It writes itself. Let's go ahead and move
on to Isaiah Bradley played by Carl Lumbly.

461
00:41:02,856 --> 00:41:07,431
Carl Lumbly is great here. When I was looking
up his... Filmography, I didn't know he has

462
00:41:07,471 --> 00:41:12,475
done a lot of DC voice roles including like
Marsha Manhunter. Oh, yeah and Silas Stone

463
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:18,260
I thought his performance was pretty great here.
He was super sympathetic You know, especially

464
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,945
when he was telling Sam that he couldn't go
back to prison. Oh, yeah I thought Carl gave

465
00:41:24,025 --> 00:41:29,169
probably the most believable performance in
this movie and that I felt sorry for him But

466
00:41:29,249 --> 00:41:34,213
I also believed that he could kick all kinds
of ass because the guy is massive. He's huge.

467
00:41:34,413 --> 00:41:40,694
Yeah I love the character of Isaiah Bradley
and I think Carl Lumpy does a perfect job portraying

468
00:41:40,734 --> 00:41:45,118
him. He was just perfect in the role, absolutely.
I was surprised that we didn't see his nephew

469
00:41:45,238 --> 00:41:49,822
Eli in this movie because he was in the Falcon
and the Winter Soldier series. And Eli is kind

470
00:41:49,842 --> 00:41:55,807
of a big part of the Young Avengers, which they're
currently setting up with Ms. Marvel and Kate

471
00:41:55,847 --> 00:42:00,611
Bishop's Hawkeye. Although I heard that they're
going to call that project the Champions instead

472
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:05,507
of Young Avengers in order to protect the Avengers
brand. Like I would have actually loved to

473
00:42:05,527 --> 00:42:11,334
have seen Sam Wilson form the Young Avengers.
Why? Because he's a good mentor. I can see

474
00:42:11,354 --> 00:42:16,861
that. And bringing Eli aboard. Yeah. Maybe they'll
still go that route. We'll see. That does it

475
00:42:16,901 --> 00:42:20,645
for all the characters I want to discuss, though.
So let's go ahead and move into our story highlights.

483
00:43:15,623 --> 00:43:20,427
Former General and Defense Secretary Thunderbolt
Ross wins his bid for presidential election

484
00:43:20,527 --> 00:43:25,191
and gives a speech about ushering an era of
peace together. Five months later, Sam Wilson

485
00:43:25,211 --> 00:43:30,415
as Captain America infiltrates a church in Oaxaca,
Mexico where the Serpent Society holds hostages

486
00:43:30,695 --> 00:43:35,399
while awaiting a buyer for their adamantium
sample stolen from the Japanese. Serpent's

487
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:40,924
leader, Sidewinder, escapes while Cap fights
Copperhead, and Joaquin Torres recovers the

488
00:43:40,964 --> 00:43:47,312
adamantium as the new Falcon. Wait, Copperhead,
that's who he fought? Yeah, that guy was Copperhead.

489
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:53,737
And another cameo, the leader of the Navy Seals
who barges in after that fight against Copperhead.

490
00:43:54,157 --> 00:44:00,261
His name is Dennis Dumphy and that is D-Man
from the comic books, the Avenger D-Man, Demolition

491
00:44:00,301 --> 00:44:07,126
Man, as he's also known. Where the stinky guy?
Yeah, the stinky guy. Oh, they killed D-Man

492
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:12,349
in this movie? Yeah, which is a shame. He got
his own Lego film recently, which I still have

493
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:16,436
yet to see. but it really makes me want to go
watch that now. You know, I'm not a huge fan

494
00:44:16,456 --> 00:44:20,779
of D-Man, but it is kind of a nice Easter egg.
No, I actually love that Easter egg. That was

495
00:44:20,799 --> 00:44:25,883
great casting too. Yeah, he looks just like
him, huh? Totally. I think the fight against

496
00:44:25,943 --> 00:44:31,366
Copperhead, as I stated earlier, really served
as a great contrast between the type of Captain

497
00:44:31,386 --> 00:44:36,130
America that Sam Wilson is in comparison to
Steve Rogers. Yeah, I think Steve Rogers would

498
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:41,113
have destroyed that guy in like three seconds,
but with Sam, he gets stabbed like six times.

499
00:44:41,626 --> 00:44:46,229
We'll say twice. We'll say he gets stabbed twice.
He still brought the guy down. And you know

500
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:52,975
what? If that guy had a jetpack, it would have
been over like that. Okay. President Ross visits

501
00:44:52,995 --> 00:44:58,379
his wife's grave and laments losing touch with
his daughter Betty, promising to change. Sam

502
00:44:58,419 --> 00:45:02,843
takes Joaquin to Baltimore to train with Isaiah
Bradley, a Korean war veteran and test subject

503
00:45:02,883 --> 00:45:07,287
in the government's efforts to recreate the
super soldier serum. Isaiah objects to Sam

504
00:45:07,347 --> 00:45:13,011
working with President Ross when he gets invited
to a but he accompanies Sam and Joaquin to

505
00:45:13,051 --> 00:45:18,594
the event. At the White House, President Ross
asks Sam to reform the Avengers, and during

506
00:45:18,634 --> 00:45:24,458
his speech, he announces a treaty between the
US, India, France, and Japan to govern the

507
00:45:24,498 --> 00:45:29,861
mining and worldwide distribution of adamantium,
a new element discovered from the emergence

508
00:45:29,941 --> 00:45:36,225
of Tiamat the Celestial, which the world now
calls Celestial Island. When the song Mr. Blue

509
00:45:36,265 --> 00:45:41,256
plays, Isaiah suddenly shoots at the president,
along with several other secret service guards.

510
00:45:41,836 --> 00:45:46,819
Sam and the Secret Service chase Isaiah down
and he denies knowledge of the attack. I thought

511
00:45:46,839 --> 00:45:52,903
it was really cool that they had Sam training
with a super soldier and a former Captain America

512
00:45:53,243 --> 00:45:57,846
like Isaiah Bradley. I thought that was perfect.
I loved seeing him training with him. Yeah,

513
00:45:58,026 --> 00:46:03,529
it was good foreshadowing to have that like
beast of a man try to hit Sam and like missing.

514
00:46:04,054 --> 00:46:08,036
Considering that at the end of the movie Sam
would be going up against the Hulk. He was

515
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:11,639
a lot bigger and stronger But you know there
was at least precedent there that they had

516
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:16,602
established that Sam's really good at dodging.
Yeah, he's really agile I really liked the

517
00:46:16,883 --> 00:46:21,526
Easter egg that they had with the mr. Blue song
the trigger song. Oh, yeah That was a nice

518
00:46:21,546 --> 00:46:27,250
shout out that I hope fans spotted because mr.
Blue was Samuel Stern's alias while he was

519
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:33,690
corresponding with mr. Green who was Bruce Banner
from the Incredible Hulk film Yeah, exactly.

520
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:37,431
While they were trying to develop a cure for
him. I noticed that I thought that was really

521
00:46:37,471 --> 00:46:42,092
cool. Believing that Isaiah was manipulated
into attacking the president, Sam approaches

522
00:46:42,152 --> 00:46:47,854
Ross in his presidential bunker, asking to investigate
the matter. Believing that Sam lacks objectivity,

523
00:46:48,234 --> 00:46:53,356
Ross tells him to stand down and instead assigns
his security advisor, Ruth Batsaraf, to the

524
00:46:53,376 --> 00:46:59,586
case. Sam visits Isaiah in prison, who is convinced
he'll now die behind bars. While discussing

525
00:46:59,606 --> 00:47:04,150
the investigation with Joaquin on a call, Sam
is attacked by Sidewinder, who reveals the

526
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:10,175
false buyer calculated where Sam would be. Sam
defeats Sidewinder and has him arrested. Did

527
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:14,098
you think it was weird that they didn't have
the line from the trailer when President Ross

528
00:47:14,118 --> 00:47:18,902
tells them you're no Steve Rogers and Sam responds
with you're right, I'm not? I can see why they

529
00:47:18,982 --> 00:47:23,085
used it in the marketing and maybe they meant
to include it in the film, but I can understand

530
00:47:23,225 --> 00:47:28,229
why they left it out of the movie because it
was kind of like President Ross's final word,

531
00:47:28,249 --> 00:47:33,267
you know. If Sam had contended that he's not,
then I feel like it would have furthered the

532
00:47:33,348 --> 00:47:37,389
argument discussion when really all that was
said needed to be said at that point. It really

533
00:47:37,429 --> 00:47:42,672
made me wonder like what else was cut from this
film and how drastically it was changed and

534
00:47:42,712 --> 00:47:47,554
reshoots, because we know that Kevin Feige did
have to come in and retool this movie. Yeah,

535
00:47:47,634 --> 00:47:51,835
initially it didn't test well. So they switched
some things up. I don't know. I couldn't tell

536
00:47:51,855 --> 00:47:57,010
you how much was cut. The Sidewinder attack
when it happened in the street scene. scared

537
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:01,512
the shit out of me. Like I was not anticipating
it. I jumped out of my seat because it was

538
00:48:01,552 --> 00:48:06,795
just so sudden, like a car accident almost.
I thought the actor Giancarlo Esposito absolutely

539
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:10,777
nailed the role, though. Do you know what Sam
was pouring on the batteries to make them like

540
00:48:10,857 --> 00:48:15,580
emit that acid cloud? It looked like it was
bleach or something like that. I don't know.

541
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,702
All I know is that it looked toxic as hell.
And I wouldn't have wanted to breathe any of

542
00:48:19,722 --> 00:48:25,005
that in or fight in that location. I did think
it was badass, though, when he put up the smoke

543
00:48:25,045 --> 00:48:30,053
screen. and then threw the dagger into Sidewinder's
chest and then drop kick the shit out of him

544
00:48:30,454 --> 00:48:34,637
into the car windshield. Yeah, both of them
got stabbed like six times. What is up with

545
00:48:34,697 --> 00:48:39,882
you and getting stabbed six times? Are you trying
to tell me something? Yeah, Sam got stabbed

546
00:48:39,902 --> 00:48:47,188
like six times. Overall, through the course
of the movie, maybe. Yeah, for sure here. President

547
00:48:47,228 --> 00:48:51,551
Ross learns that the Japanese are backing out
of his treaty and that Samuel Stearns, whom

548
00:48:51,591 --> 00:48:58,329
Ross kept imprisoned was behind the assassination
attempt. Ruth witnesses Stern use guards at

549
00:48:58,429 --> 00:49:04,054
Isaiah's prison to kill the would-be assassins,
except for Isaiah who was put in solitary confinement.

550
00:49:04,795 --> 00:49:09,739
Sam has Joaquin trace a call from Sidewinder's
phone to Camp Echo 1, where they investigate

551
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:15,324
and find Samuel Sterns, who uses mind-controlled
prison guards to attack the pair and cover

552
00:49:15,384 --> 00:49:21,674
his escape. In trying to find the words to describe
the leader's mind-control technology, I stumbled

553
00:49:21,714 --> 00:49:27,899
upon an article written by the New York Times
and another one by IGN that a group of South

554
00:49:27,919 --> 00:49:34,604
Korean scientists discovered that they can use
strobing lights to turn on and off brain cells

555
00:49:34,724 --> 00:49:40,589
in the human mind and they use it as a way to
treat neurological disorders. But theoretically,

556
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:47,215
it could also be used in this weird mind control
way. Oh, thanks. I am now terrified of YouTube.

557
00:49:48,636 --> 00:49:54,328
Yeah, yeah. New Fear Unlocked. I guess it would
explain why you're not a huge fan of this movie,

558
00:49:54,348 --> 00:49:58,411
because you've been mind controlled by too much
television. I think that makes sense now. I

559
00:49:58,431 --> 00:50:03,656
can't even deny it. I don't know if that's true.
It could be true. President Ross flies to Tokyo

560
00:50:03,696 --> 00:50:08,540
to convince the Japanese prime minister to sign
the treaty, but the PM provides evidence that

561
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:14,185
Ross ordered the theft of Japan's adamantium
sample. Sam meets with Navy SEAL Dennis Dumphy

562
00:50:14,225 --> 00:50:19,109
to interrogate Sidewinder and learns that the
leader hired the Serpent Society through the

563
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:25,343
CIA. in an effort to destroy Ross's reputation.
Sam and Joaquin shut down Stern's mind control

564
00:50:25,383 --> 00:50:30,625
tech, but not before he gets two US pilots to
attack the Japanese fleet in the Indian Ocean

565
00:50:31,065 --> 00:50:36,506
near Celestial Island. Sam and Joaquin rendezvous
with President Ross, who orders Sam and Joaquin

566
00:50:36,526 --> 00:50:41,628
to intercept the mind controlled pilots. They
manage to subdue them in a dogfight, convincing

567
00:50:41,668 --> 00:50:47,049
the Japanese to stand down, though Joaquin is
critically injured. My favorite part of the

568
00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:53,643
dogfight. was when Sam used Red Wing to hold
the Captain America shield. So it provided

569
00:50:53,723 --> 00:50:59,225
protection from behind as Sam was being chased
by the pilot. I thought that was fucking awesome.

570
00:50:59,605 --> 00:51:03,546
I giggled like a little kid with Glee when I
saw that. Yeah, Red Wing just continues to

571
00:51:03,586 --> 00:51:09,228
be one of the coolest characters in the MCU,
I would argue, a drone character that you could

572
00:51:09,248 --> 00:51:13,709
like communicate with. That's just awesome.
Drones are dope. As much as I love Red Wing

573
00:51:13,749 --> 00:51:19,607
from the comic books. you know, an actual falcon.
The adaptation of him as a drone in these movies

574
00:51:19,747 --> 00:51:24,328
is too damn cool to shit on. I even like how
they used him in the final battle against the

575
00:51:24,368 --> 00:51:29,170
Hulk as like a ongoing distraction, shooting
him with lasers and bullets at the same time.

576
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:36,132
Yeah, like flashbangs, that was really cool.
Yeah, yeah. I want a red wing. So do I. Ross

577
00:51:36,172 --> 00:51:41,153
reveals to Sam that he made a deal with Stearns
to have him cure his heart condition in exchange

578
00:51:41,193 --> 00:51:45,191
for a release from prison. but then reneged
on the deal out of fear that he would stop

579
00:51:45,211 --> 00:51:50,434
making his heart medication, and that Stearns
was seeking revenge for that. Sam questions

580
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:54,996
himself while visiting Joaquin at the Walter
Reed National Medical Center, but is reassured

581
00:51:55,036 --> 00:52:00,920
by Bucky, who's running for Congress, and asserts
to Sam that he's upholding Steve's legacy well.

582
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:05,302
It was kind of wild to me that Bucky was too
busy running for Congress to help out his friend.

583
00:52:05,642 --> 00:52:09,304
Well by that point there was nothing to help
with in that exact moment. It was kind of like

584
00:52:09,344 --> 00:52:13,283
the situation was resolved at that point. even
though the leader was still out there, but

585
00:52:13,343 --> 00:52:17,666
you know, Ross hadn't turned into the Red Hulk
yet. And we hadn't had the second climax by

586
00:52:17,706 --> 00:52:23,370
that point. Do you think that felt tacked on
then? No, I don't think so. Does Bucky run

587
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:28,214
for Congress in the comics? No, not to my knowledge.
No, he doesn't start a political career or

588
00:52:28,274 --> 00:52:33,038
anything. So this is pretty unique to the movies.
You know, it does seem like he eventually goes

589
00:52:33,118 --> 00:52:37,541
back to being a superhero though, as we'll see
in the upcoming Thunderbolts movie. So I don't

590
00:52:37,561 --> 00:52:43,073
know if... He's like a superhero congressman,
or if he loses his election, or what happens

591
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:47,636
there. That's kind of weird, I feel like. Yeah,
a little bit. We'll see where it goes. Back

592
00:52:47,656 --> 00:52:51,618
in Washington, President Ross gets a phone call
from his daughter Betty before going to the

593
00:52:51,658 --> 00:52:56,802
White House lawn for a press conference about
the treaty. Stearns visits Sam at the Medical

594
00:52:56,842 --> 00:53:01,605
Center to admonish him for ruining his plans
regarding the treaty and is apprehended, but

595
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:06,729
warns that Ross is still in danger. During the
briefing, audio is played over the speakers

596
00:53:06,789 --> 00:53:11,747
of Ross' call with Stearns, implicating him
in his dealings with the villain. Enraged,

597
00:53:11,867 --> 00:53:17,029
Ross turns into the Red Hulk and Sam flies in
to stop him. Red Hulk destroys much of the

598
00:53:17,049 --> 00:53:21,311
White House before Sam can take the battle first
to the Washington Monument and then Hanes Point

599
00:53:21,371 --> 00:53:25,873
at the Cherry Blossom Grove. Though Sam gets
his suit destroyed, he uses his counseling

600
00:53:25,913 --> 00:53:30,575
skills to appeal to the Red Hulk's love for
his daughter, Betty, represented by the cherry

601
00:53:30,595 --> 00:53:36,257
blossom trees, and Ross reverts to his human
form. As much as you hate that moment, I really

602
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:41,511
liked the line during the fight, when Sam was
like, Bucky's line was bullshit. I should have

603
00:53:41,531 --> 00:53:45,333
taken the serum. Yeah, that was the funniest
line of the whole movie I thought. What I don't

604
00:53:45,353 --> 00:53:51,315
understand is why when the Red Hulk arrived
in the cherry blossom Grove, his D transformation

605
00:53:51,335 --> 00:53:54,636
didn't work then. And Sam was like, dang it,
I thought this was gonna work or something

606
00:53:54,676 --> 00:53:59,538
like that. And then all of a sudden, for some
reason, it did work just at this random moment.

607
00:53:59,899 --> 00:54:05,341
You're not wrong. Sam did try to appeal to Ross's
love for his daughter when he first brought

608
00:54:05,361 --> 00:54:11,336
him into the cherry blossom Grove. It wasn't
until after he like detonated all of that kinetic

609
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:16,559
energy into the Red Hulk that he kind of stunned
the creature. And then for some reason, it

610
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:20,401
worked, I think maybe because he was able to
stun the creature and kind of brought him out

611
00:54:20,421 --> 00:54:24,343
of that rage that he was finally able to get
through to him, because I don't think Red Hulk

612
00:54:24,363 --> 00:54:29,166
was listening the first time. But he wasn't
even stunned. Like he got up and he was still

613
00:54:29,286 --> 00:54:33,948
angry. He was still Red Hulk. I think he was
a little bit stunned. Like that's a lot of

614
00:54:33,968 --> 00:54:40,151
kinetic energy that those wings absorbed. Debatable.
How is that debatable? That he was stunned.

615
00:54:40,632 --> 00:54:46,474
Oh. I mean, that's what you have to go with.
I refuse! Don't be a stubborn asshole. Sam

616
00:54:46,494 --> 00:54:51,157
visits the prison where Isaiah is exonerated
and freed, and then visits Ross in the Raft

617
00:54:51,217 --> 00:54:56,419
Prison where it's revealed that though the Adamantium
Treaty was ratified, Ross took responsibility

618
00:54:56,439 --> 00:55:01,241
for his actions and resigned as president. His
daughter Betty also stops by to visit him.

619
00:55:01,730 --> 00:55:05,931
Sam then visits Joaquin in the hospital where
he reassures him that though it can feel like

620
00:55:05,951 --> 00:55:10,713
you have to be perfect as a hero, it's more
about doing your best. He invites him to join

621
00:55:10,773 --> 00:55:16,136
the New Avengers. In a post-credit scene, the
leader tells Sam that he has calculated that

622
00:55:16,176 --> 00:55:22,699
a war between worlds is coming. Which was super
vague, like super safe. I didn't love it. I

623
00:55:22,759 --> 00:55:27,881
especially didn't love the dialogue. See, this
is a joke. No joke from you. I would think

624
00:55:28,061 --> 00:55:33,984
would be funny because you. hurt people. I don't
know, something stupid like that. I do think

625
00:55:34,024 --> 00:55:38,466
it's good that, you know, how many movies are
we into the multiversal saga? And it seems

626
00:55:38,506 --> 00:55:43,669
like outside of Spider-Man and Doctor Strange,
no one really on Earth even seems to know about

627
00:55:43,709 --> 00:55:48,712
the multiverse. So as a concept, the multiversal
thing seems late to the party. But Leader's

628
00:55:48,732 --> 00:55:52,734
statement was a good way, I think, to get the
ball rolling, at least with the new Avengers

629
00:55:52,774 --> 00:55:53,855
team that's going to be formed.

630
00:55:59,674 --> 00:56:06,418
or other people in their universe, like incursions.
Other people in other worlds that they would

631
00:56:06,458 --> 00:56:12,422
have to be fighting. So like villains in other
universes. Okay. And maybe specifically he

632
00:56:12,462 --> 00:56:16,824
was even talking about Dr. Doom or Kang since
we don't know what's happening with that officially

633
00:56:16,884 --> 00:56:21,387
yet. I would have loved a mid credit scene.
I think as Devin Davis, one of our executive

634
00:56:21,427 --> 00:56:27,631
producers stated, it was strange to have two
of Hulk's big villains in a movie and not have

635
00:56:27,671 --> 00:56:32,674
the Hulk himself show up at least once. That's
what I was saying earlier. No one listens to

636
00:56:32,694 --> 00:56:37,818
what you say ever. I'm saying the movie would
have been better with the Hulk cameo. And sure,

637
00:56:37,858 --> 00:56:44,162
make it mid credits, that's fine. I think overall
the movie was good. I really liked it. I enjoyed

638
00:56:44,202 --> 00:56:50,767
my time in the theater and I think it lived
up to my expectations. The film admirably coheres

639
00:56:50,847 --> 00:56:56,502
some of the Marvel's best continuity while delivering
on, you know, political thriller elements that

640
00:56:56,522 --> 00:57:03,206
we expect from the Captain America franchise.
In all, I'm giving it 4 stars out of 5 and

641
00:57:03,246 --> 00:57:10,610
giving it a fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes.
I disagree. I don't think it's 4 stars. I think

642
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:14,972
there's problems with the whole continuity considering
a lot of people haven't done their homework.

643
00:57:15,413 --> 00:57:19,435
That's not my concern. I think there are problems
with the action. I think there were problems

644
00:57:19,515 --> 00:57:23,977
with the villains in the story and the way both
of them were defeated. I think there was problems

645
00:57:23,997 --> 00:57:29,941
with the... the acting and the editing and the
direction and the budget. I do not think this

646
00:57:29,961 --> 00:57:34,863
is a four star film. I think it's a three star
film, maybe three and a half, but definitely

647
00:57:34,904 --> 00:57:41,647
not a four. And yet you gave the Flash four
and a half stars. OK, OK. Hey, hey, I'm sorry.

648
00:57:44,749 --> 00:57:49,772
I was young and immature and I changed my ways.
I don't think you have. I don't think you have.

649
00:57:50,272 --> 00:57:56,670
But let us know what you guys thought about
the movie. AJ9K, help close this out. Thanks

00:58:25,822 --> 00:58:33,064
In our next episode, we are doing a team duel
between Darksides elite. So like Calaback and

656
00:58:33,084 --> 00:58:39,287
Granny Goodness and Dasad and Steppenwolf against
Thanos's Black Order, which you may recall

657
00:58:39,407 --> 00:58:45,750
from the Infinity War films. Right. Yeah, it's
people like Ebony Maw, Corvus Glaive, Proxima

658
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:51,472
Midnight. It's Thanos's team versus Darksides
team. And this was a battle chosen by our executive

659
00:58:51,512 --> 00:58:57,115
producers. And I'm really interested in a rematch
between Darkseid and Thanos. If you guys haven't

660
00:58:57,155 --> 00:59:02,239
listened to that Duel episode, definitely check
