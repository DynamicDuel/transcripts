00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,960
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi, welcome to
the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,759
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,640
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin

4
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:44,420
brother, Marvelous Joe. And in this episode, we
are doing a surprise Team Duel episode between

5
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:50,860
DC's Birds of Prey and Marvel's A-Force. Yeah,
we're doing this special team duel in honor of

6
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,340
Women's History Month, so to celebrate all the
women's out there, here's your duel of badass

7
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,580
female superhero teams. Not gonna lie, I'm a
little nervous about this because I know A-Force

8
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:08,600
is essentially female Avengers and Birds of Prey
tends to be a little bit more street level, so we'll

9
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,780
see how it goes later on in this episode. Before
that, we are not going to break down the comic book

10
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:20,000
movie news from this past week because there isn't
any, not anything concrete anyway. Yeah, we did

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,560
get news that Sadie Sink has been cast in the new
Spider-Man movie, but there's nothing really to

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,500
discuss there because we don't know who she's
playing. But we will be having a question of the

13
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,740
week later on this episode. As always, we list our
segment times and our episode description, so

14
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,740
feel free to check out the show notes if you want to

of the way, quick to the no prize. A no prize is an

34
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,160
award Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version,
the Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award we

35
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,540
post on Instagram for the person that we feel gave
the best answer to our question of the week. Last

36
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:44,520
week, we asked you guys, what is your favorite
Marvel and DC comics crossover and why? And this is

37
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:50,580
coming off the news that Marvel and DC are going to
put out two one shot crossover issues later on this

38
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,680
year sometime in 2025. We don't have any of the
specific details on it, but we love the idea and

39
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,360
thought it was worth asking about. Yeah, we got
three answers for this question. So let's break

40
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:06,260
down our two honorable mentions before revealing
this week's no prize winner. Our first honorable

41
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:13,620
mention goes to by DearBangora who said, Hello,
Dynamic Dual. I think the best Marvel DC crossover

42
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:19,380
is Batman versus Punisher. The fact that both
characters have strict codes that are vastly

43
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:27,100
different, but that unites them as well. I also
like that we can see the creation of Red Hood coming

44
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,220
from this crossover being a mix of both
characters. So for me, Punisher versus Batman,

45
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,620
the dichotomy and the difference between the
characters and their code and their will makes

46
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,620
this comic book. Yeah, it looks like he got cut off
there, but he's referring to the Punisher Batman

47
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:48,800
deadly knights crossover comic book in which
Punisher pays a visit to Gotham City. And if that

48
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:53,720
concept sounds intriguing to you, hell yeah, it
was. I really like that comic book, even though,

49
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,060
you know, Batman kind of beats a shit out of
Punisher towards the end and kind of like humbles

50
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:04,040
him. Punisher does get in a good line where he tells
Batman that he and the Joker deserve each other. So

51
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:10,880
I like that. Yeah, Punisher also makes Joker
essentially shit himself, too. So that was also a

52
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,380
great moment from the comic. Yeah, it was a great
look at just like the two moralities of the

53
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,580
character. You know, Punisher, he kills his bad
guys and he basically saw Batman as liable and all

54
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,960
of the Joker's murders because he wouldn't kill
the Joker. You know, it's always been an

55
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,000
interesting debate. And it was one that was
explored in that comic. So that philosophical

56
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,860
aspect alone, I think, sets it a level above quite a
few DC Marvel crossovers. Great answer by

57
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,900
DearBangora. Our next honorable mention goes to
Mason Thompson. Who said? Hey, what's up? It's

58
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:49,080
Mason. And I would have to say if it was my favorite
Marvel and DC crossover, I'd just do the two,

59
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:59,300
probably be one Batman Humboldt Punisher,
because I was stuff and or one if it's just DC, then

60
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:05,420
it would be Batman when he went over to Ninja
Turtles. Because that is always so cool to see him

61
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:12,780
fight with like all the turtles and yeah. Yeah, I'm
not sure if Mason is referring again to the

62
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:18,020
Punisher Batman deadly knights crossover,
because I'm kind of ashamed to say that Batman has

63
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,400
actually beat the shit out of Punisher in multiple
crossovers. I remember in J.L .A. Avengers,

64
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,440
Punisher was in the middle of killing some bad guys
while Batman was doing reconnaissance in the

65
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,420
Marvel Universe. And then Batman saw him doing
this and then broke through the warehouse and then

66
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:36,240
beat the shit out of Punisher to keep him from
killing everybody. I mean, is it any surprise,

67
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,920
though? Like Punisher is not at the level of
martial arts finesse that Batman is. He doesn't

68
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,520
need to when he has bullets. And plus, he's he's a
pretty damn good fighter. He's a really good

69
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:53,760
fighter, but he's also like 70. And Batman's like
not anymore. But no, Batman and the Teenage Mutant

70
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,500
Ninja Turtles crossover was also awesome. They
made a movie about it. And we actually did a review

71
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,500
of that film on a guest spot for the Ready to Retro
podcast where we talk all about that movie and the

72
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,880
comic. It was good time. So make sure to check that
out if you haven't. Yeah, we love the Ready to

73
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:14,600
Retro, guys. So great answer, Mason Thompson. The
winner of this week's No Prize is Christopher

74
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:20,000
Minotti, who said. Hi, guys, this is Christopher
Minotti. My favorite would have to be the four

75
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,100
issues of Marvel vs. DC, because it's exactly what
comic book fans love. The discussion of which side

76
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:33,360
is stronger, whose characters would win more
fights. And I feel like those four issues, it

77
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:39,740
showed that while sometimes DC character will win
and sometimes a Marvel character will win. In the

78
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:46,540
end, Marvel will always lose to Superman. Now, if I
remember correctly in that miniseries, Marvel

79
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:52,480
actually won a majority of those matches, but it
was total bullshit because a few of the winners

80
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,760
were determined by fan votes and there's no way
Wolverine at Storm would have beaten Lobo and

81
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:02,380
Wonder Woman. Yeah, they would have. It showed in
the comic just how that would have happened. It

82
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:08,560
literally didn't, though. Like Wolverine and
Lobo go behind a bar and then Wolverine just stands

83
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,680
up and smokes a cigar. It's like, what happened
behind that bar? He gutted him like he said he

84
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,300
would. That's what happened. OK, so he did
something that wouldn't kill Lobo. Gotcha. You

85
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:24,460
sound like a fucking whiny loser. Maybe don't be so
jealous about Marvel's victories. I'm super

86
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:31,800
bitter about it. I don't care. No, that crossover
event was a defining moment, I think, for my

87
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:36,240
Jonathan's childhood. I remember going to the
comic book store and getting the big Marvel versus

88
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,780
DC poster that they were selling there along with
the comic books. And it was just a magical time,

89
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:49,560
really. And in many ways, influenced us into doing
this podcast like 20 years later. Oh, absolutely.

90
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,800
Yeah, if you guys haven't listened to our guest
spot on the Rankers, where we talk about why DC or

91
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,100
Marvel is better, definitely check that episode
out as well, because I talk about how the DC versus

92
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:06,340
Marvel mini series influenced us when we first
started reading comics. But great answer,

93
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,700
Christopher. You win this week's No Prize. If
you're the listener who won a shot at winning your

94
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:14,860
own No Prize, stay tuned to later on in this episode
when we'll be asking another question of the week

95
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:24,580
and know that that's done onto the question of the
week. What character do you think Sadie Sink will

96
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:30,460
be playing in the upcoming fourth Spider-Man film
from Marvel Studios? And we received a word over

97
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:35,240
this past week that Sadie Sink has been cast. We
just don't know what role she's playing. There's a

98
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,300
lot of conjecture out there, but we want to hear
what you guys think and why. Record your answer at

102
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:58,700
favorite answer and award that person a dynamic
dual No Prize that will post to Instagram. Be sure

103
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:11,840
to answer before March 22nd. But let's go ahead and
move on to the main event of this episode, where we

104
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:35,260
find out who would win in a battle between the all
female teams of Birds of Prey and a force. OK, Birds

105
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:42,480
of Prey versus a force. As we mentioned earlier,
these are two all female teams from DC and Marvel

106
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:49,000
respectively. Birds of Prey, notoriously, you
could say, had a live action film, but it was really

107
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,560
just a Harley Quinn film. A force has not had its own
movie. No, but they also notoriously had a moment

108
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:01,880
in Avengers Endgame where a lot of the female
superheroes that were fighting against Thanos in

109
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:08,480
the climactic battle joined together to help get
the Infinity Gauntlet over to Ant-Man and the Wasp

110
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,000
as they were powering up the Quantum Tunnel. A lot
of people found it pandering, but I actually loved

111
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,920
it as a comic book fan because I was like, it's
fucking a force. They're like doing an Easter egg

112
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:23,220
for that. I guess if you didn't know the comics and
just thought that they were doing it for girl

113
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,900
power, then I can maybe see where they were coming
from. But I personally enjoyed that moment in that

114
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:33,780
movie. Yeah, I didn't know what a force was at the
time when I saw that. So I definitely was like, oh,

115
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:40,460
look, they're all posing together. Girl power.
Yeah, I think the boys' television show made fun of

116
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:45,660
it, too, at some point. But they don't know they're
just fucking cynical. I mean, let's be real. That

117
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:51,160
scene was kind of better than the entirety of Birds
of Prey, though. You're not wrong. And Birds of

118
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:57,660
Prey wasn't even that bad. It was just a really bad
Birds of Prey film. Right. I mean, the movie should

119
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,440
have been called Harley Quinn and the Birds of
Prey. The Birds of Prey team shouldn't have taken

120
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,660
center stage because they really weren't the
focus and they weren't really adapted that well.

121
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:10,060
Right, exactly. So if the only thing you know about
the Birds of Prey is the movie, forget everything

122
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:14,500
you know about the Birds of Prey. Yeah, the origin
for Birds of Prey in the comic books is way

123
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:21,460
different from the film. But I got to say the origin
for a force is almost non-existent in the comic

124
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:26,860
books. They just manifested as a team within the
alternate reality of battle worlds that Dr. Doom

125
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:31,640
created. So there's no real origin story for a
force, but they do have, you know, a history. OK,

126
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,240
well, that's almost like Birds of Prey, too,
because they didn't even call themselves Birds of

127
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:41,000
Prey or think of themselves as an official team
until like issue 80. Oh, wow. Well, I can't wait to

128
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,600
hear all about their backstory as we go into that in
a bit here. But to explain the methodology behind

129
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,720
our duels, let's go to our sentient dual
simulator, Alfred Jarvis, 9000. Adrian and I, K

130
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,300
tell our listeners how you go about determining a
winner in our dual matchups. Yes, of course, sir.

131
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,840
The way I determine a winner between the two teams
is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations

132
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:06,080
between every character on each team using their
statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation is a

133
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,280
probabilistic model used to determine outcomes
through random sampling. In this case, I

134
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:15,500
randomize the statistics along a normal
distribution as a way to simulate the many

135
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,480
variables that can occur during battle. The stat
parameters are based on the official Marvel power

136
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,760
grid from which the DC characters statistics are
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are

137
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,300
included such as range, damage potential,
versatility and perception in order to create a

138
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:36,620
more detailed and accurate simulation. The
results of the 49,000 simulations provide a

139
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:41,640
percentage of wins for each character on both
teams. The team with the higher average win rate is

140
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,980
declared the victor as they have a higher
probability to win any given battle. In an

141
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:51,240
equitable pairing, neither team should win 100%
of the matches. The comic book stories have shown

142
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:55,620
that there's even a way for Batman to defeat
Superman, so the confidence rate of my method

143
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:59,660
falls in line with the precedents that have been
established in the source material. My

144
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:04,260
mathematical simulations are without
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole

145
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:11,100
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for
determination of the winner. Thanks to J9K.

146
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,040
Before we run the simulations, though, we like to
break down each team's histories and rosters

147
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:21,300
before improvising a scenario on how we imagine
one of the many simulations would play out beat for

148
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:27,620
beat. And I believe it's my turn to go first with the
DC team's backstory. So let me tell you about Birds

149
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:33,520
of Prey. The Birds of Prey began as a partnership
between Barbara Gordon, the former Batgirl, now

150
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:39,280
operating as the information broker known as
Oracle, and Dynal Lance, the martial arts expert

151
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:44,680
and vigilante known as Black Canary, each of whom
you can learn more about in their respective duels

152
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:50,640
against Hawkeye, Kate Bishop, and Black Widow.
Now after suffering a spinal injury at the hands of

153
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:56,900
the Joker, Barbara reinvented herself as Oracle,
creating a vast intelligence network that

154
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:02,880
provided real-time information to superheroes
worldwide. Initially, she sought out Powergirl

155
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:08,580
as her first field agent, but after an early
mission resulted in tragic casualties,

156
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,440
Powergirl severed ties with Oracle, leaving
Barbara searching for a more compatible

157
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:19,520
operative. Oracle eventually turned to Black
Canary, a veteran crime fighter who had lost her

158
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:25,120
Canary cry, but continued patrolling the streets
as a highly skilled combatant. Operating from the

159
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,940
Gotham City clock tower, Oracle and Black Canary
formed a formidable duo, with Dynah handling

160
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,520
field operations and Barbara coordinating
commissions behind the scenes. Their

161
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:41,020
partnership thrived, despite occasional
ideological differences, and over time, Oracle

162
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:46,700
expanded her intelligence network to include a
growing roster of agents. The team solidified

163
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:51,380
when Black Canary was captured by the villainous
Savant, an information broker and former

164
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:56,740
vigilante who sought to control Gotham's
underworld. Unable to call upon the Bat Family for

165
00:15:56,740 --> 00:16:02,780
assistance, Oracle reached out to Huntress, a
brutal and relentless vigilante with ties to the

166
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:08,060
city's criminal underbelly. Working together,
Oracle and Huntress successfully rescued Black

167
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:13,440
Canary, leading Barbara to formally recruit
Huntress as a full-time agent. And you, of course,

168
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:19,480
can learn more about Huntress in her dual episode
against Jessica Jones. Soon after, Lady Black

169
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:25,240
Hawk, a time-displaced World War II pilot and
former member of the Black Hawk Squadron, joined

170
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,780
the team after a mission involving a hijacked
aircraft. Though she was originally an outlier

171
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:36,120
due to her outdated views and hard drinking
demeanor, Lady Black Hawk quickly became an

172
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:42,480
invaluable member, serving as the team's pilot
and transport specialist. With its core trio of

173
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,660
Oracle, Black Canary and Huntress, along with
Lady Black Hawk providing air support, the Birds

174
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:52,760
of Prey expanded their operations, tackling
threats that other hero teams ignored or were

175
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:58,840
unable to address. They faced off against
criminals such as Cheshire, Senator Pullman, and

176
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,900
the Blackmailer Savant while also dealing with
espionage, human trafficking, and

177
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,660
international crime syndicates. For years, the
Birds of Prey operated from Oracle's Command

178
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:13,800
Center inside the Gotham Clock Tower, but their
headquarters came under attack during a

179
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:19,619
full-scale gang war. Black Mask, the crime lord
who had taken control of Gotham's underworld,

180
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:24,420
targeted Oracle's operations, leading an
assault that resulted in the Clock Tower's

181
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:30,400
destruction. Forced to abandon Gotham, Barbara
temporarily disbanded the team and went into

182
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:36,480
hiding. After a brief time operating covertly,
Oracle reassembled the Birds of Prey, now

183
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,140
stationed aboard the ARE-1, a high-tech mobile
command aircraft outfitted with cutting-edge

184
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:47,540
surveillance and tactical equipment. From
there, they took on high-risk missions across the

185
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:52,200
globe, tackling threats ranging from
super-powered crime syndicates to political

186
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:58,000
conspiracies. Seeking a more stable base of
operations, Oracle relocated the team to

187
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,540
Metropolis, but their presence in Superman's
city led to clashes with local authorities and

188
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:09,460
rival vigilante groups. Eventually, they
settled in Platinum Flats, a high-tech city on the

189
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:15,420
West Coast with deep ties to organized crime and
corporate corruption. With a growing roster that

190
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:21,500
now included Big Barda, Manhunter, Gypsy, and
Judo Master, the Birds of Prey fought against the

191
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,580
city's underground syndicates while facing
opposition from the metahuman criminal

192
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,640
underworld. During their time in Platinum Flats,
the team found themselves targeted by Spy

193
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:36,200
Smasher, the alias of Katarina Armstrong, a
former government operative and Barbara's

194
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:42,720
childhood rival. Katarina sought to take control
of the Birds of Prey, leveraging her influence to

195
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,880
force Oracle out. This led to a dramatic
confrontation where Barbara challenged the Spy

196
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:53,760
Smasher to a one-on-one fight, with the winner
taking control of the organization. Despite her

197
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:59,260
physical limitations, Oracle outmaneuvered Spy
Smasher and won the fight. However, Katarina

198
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:04,780
refused to honor their agreement. Before she
could make a move against Oracle, the Birds of Prey

199
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:10,720
assembled in full force alongside numerous
allies including Black Canary, Wildcat, and even

200
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,260
the assassin Lady Shiva. Overwhelmed and
outmatched, Spy Smasher had no choice but to back

201
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:21,600
down, and Oracle secured the Birds of Prey's
independence once and for all. As Oracle's

202
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:27,960
intelligence network grew, so did her list of
enemies. Chief among them was the Calculator, a

203
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,000
cyber-criminal and information broker who
sought to unmask Oracle and eliminate her as a

204
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,700
threat. Their ongoing digital war escalated when
the Calculator attempted to harness fragments of

205
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:44,540
the Anti-Life Equation, a cosmic formula capable
of controlling minds. To counter his growing

206
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:49,920
power, Oracle led an all-out cyber assault
enlisting allies such as Cassandra Kane,

207
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:54,740
Huntress, and even members of the Justice League
to dismantle his operations. Though she

208
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:59,320
successfully thwarted Calculator's plans, the
battle left her questioning her own

209
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:04,680
effectiveness, leading her to temporarily
disband the Birds of Prey once again to reassess

210
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:10,460
her role. Following Batman's apparent death,
Oracle resumed operations in Gotham City,

211
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:15,400
assisting Nightwing in maintaining order as
criminals seized the opportunity to expand their

212
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,900
influence. She reassembled the Birds of Prey with
a new lineup that included the Medi-Human Bruiser

213
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:27,220
Hawk, the Pacifist Warrior Dove, and a returning
Countress. Establishing a new headquarters in

214
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:33,060
Cord Tower, during this time, Black Canary left
the team to raise her adopted daughter, Sin, but

215
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:38,620
eventually returned when the Birds faced a
resurgence of organized crime in Gotham. The team

216
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:44,080
also recruited two new members, Black Alice, a
teenage sorceress with the ability to

217
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,140
temporarily steal magical powers, and Misfit, a
homeless runaway with teleportation abilities

218
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,760
whom Oracle took under her wing. As the Birds of
Prey continued to expand, they took on major

219
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,860
players in the criminal underworld, including an
underground Medi-Human trafficking gang and the

220
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:05,300
growing influence of the villainous
organization known as the Secret Six. Their

221
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:11,160
battles led to high stakes confrontations
against figures like Harley Quinn, Talia El Ghul,

222
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,680
and her League of Assassins. Following the
Flashpoint event, the history of the Birds of Prey

223
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:21,320
was rebooted, and the team was reestablished as a
covert operations unit based in Gotham City.

224
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:26,640
Black Canary formed a new incarnation of the
group, recruiting Starling, Batgirl, Katana,

225
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,460
and Poison Ivy for a series of high-risk missions.
Their early cases involved stopping a villain

226
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:38,760
known as Choke, who used nanotechnology to turn
people into living bombs. The team faced internal

227
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,380
strife when Poison Ivy attempted to manipulate
them into joining her crusade against

228
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:49,300
environmental criminals. Katana ultimately
killed Ivy in self-defense, leaving the team

229
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:56,540
shaken. Shortly after, Starling betrayed them to
both Mr. Freeze and the Court leading to further

230
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:02,360
fractures within the group. After learning that
her presumed dead ex-husband, Kurt Lance, was

231
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:08,560
being held captive by the terrorist organization
Basilisk, Black Canary went rogue to rescue him.

232
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:14,080
This put her at odds with Amanda Waller, who had
manipulated the team from behind the scenes. When

233
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,280
Ras Al Ghul entered the conflict offering Black
Canary a Lazarus pet serum in exchange for her

234
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:24,520
cooperation, she turned him down, setting off a
chain of events that nearly led to the team's

235
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:30,200
destruction. In the latest incarnation of the
team, Black Canary has once again taken charge,

236
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:37,020
forming a new squad consisting of Cassandra Kane,
Big Barda, Zellet, and Harley Quinn. Now

237
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:42,840
team-wise, I knew that Barbara Gordon would be a
no-brainer to include on my 7-person roster,

238
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:49,180
since she's the entire reason the team exists.
She's joining as Batgirl, not Oracle though, as

239
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:54,040
Batgirl has been a member in recent years in the
comics. Black Canary and Huntress were also

240
00:22:54,040 --> 00:23:00,160
Shoe-ins considering they and Barbara form the
core team of Birds of Prey. I decided to also go with

241
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:05,100
Powergirl, since she was technically Barbara's
first field agent prior to recruiting Black

242
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:11,920
Canary, as well as Dove, one half of Hawk and Dove,
though replacing Hawk will be Hawk Girl, who has

243
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:18,320
helped the team against the Seeker 6 and is a bird of
prey in her own right. For my 7th and final team

244
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:24,320
member, I could have gone with Lady Black Hawk, who
I would consider to be a 4th core member if there

245
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:29,540
ever was one, but there have been much more
interesting characters on the Birds of Prey team,

246
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:35,420
especially ones that I knew wouldn't drag down the
team's stats like Lady Black Hawk would, who's

247
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:42,380
pretty weak. In the end, I decided to go with Vixen
as my final team member, as she's a powerhouse that

248
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:49,060
I believe will help raise what is traditionally a
street level team like Birds of Prey to a force

249
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:58,320
level. So that's my team. Batgirl, Black Canary,
Huntress, Powergirl, Dove, Hawk Girl, and Vixen.

250
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,980
Has Vixen ever been associated with the team? Yes,
she has been a field agent for Oracle in the past.

251
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:10,280
She helped Huntress bring down some cults in the
Pacific Northwest. Okay, all right. That's a

252
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:15,640
pretty damn good lineup. It was interesting to
hear how for the majority of their existence, the

253
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:20,100
Birds of Prey were supported and founded by
Barbara Gordon as Oracle. It's kind of hard to know

254
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:26,180
what the team functions like when Barbara Gordon
is Batgirl as opposed to Oracle. Well, she just

255
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:31,840
does all of her information brokering in the
field. She still has computer gadgets attached to

256
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,160
her suit and stuff like that. She's definitely
still like the brains of the team, just that now

257
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,760
she's fighting alongside them. That's pretty
cool. I like that. It was also interesting to see

258
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:46,160
that Harley Quinn has become a member of the team. I
feel like they only did that because of the movie. I

259
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,960
agree. Yeah, 100%. That's the case. I was actually
thinking of including Harley Quinn on this team

260
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:57,660
since she does have that tie in in the general
public's mind considering she was in the movie.

261
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:01,780
But I already used Harley Quinn in the Suicide
Squad versus Defenders team doled that we did

262
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:08,160
earlier. Yeah, that's right. Well, let me go ahead
and get into a forces backstory. A Force was an all

263
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:13,620
female superhero team that emerged in the
alternate reality of Battle World, a patchwork

264
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:19,000
planet created by Dr. Doom following the
destruction of the multiverse. They operated as

265
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,480
the defenders of Arcadia, a utopian island
territory within Battle World under the

266
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:30,000
leadership of She-Hulk, who also served as
Arcadia's appointed Baroness. Wait, is Arcadia

267
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,720
an all female island? No, they had dudes there, but
it was just run by women. But it's an island utopia.

268
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:43,800
Yeah. Oh, just like them. It's not like them. RIP
off. Anyway, the founding roster included over 40

269
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:50,400
women heroes, including Captain Marvel, Ms.
Marvel, Spider Woman, Medusa, Dazzler, Nico

270
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:56,860
Minoru, and Mockingbird to The team protected
Arcadia from a Megalodon attack off the island's

271
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:01,880
coast. They successfully subdued the creature,
but Miss America hurled it beyond the massive

272
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:07,880
shield wall that separated Arcadia from the
zombie infested Deadlands and inadvertently

273
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:13,960
damaging the barrier. This act violated Dr.
Doom's laws and despite She-Hulk's protests, the

274
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:20,300
Thor core, who were the elite enforcers of Doom's
rule, arrived to arrest America Chavez. She was

275
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:25,920
sentenced to exile, forced to serve as guardian of
the shield for the rest of her life. In response,

276
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:31,360
She-Hulk tasked Arcadia's undersea residents,
including Namor, Namorita, and Namora, with

277
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,260
investigating the origins of the Megalodon
attack. Meanwhile, Nico Minoru discovered a

278
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:42,140
mysterious girl who had fallen from the sky. A
female variant of Loki advised Nico to bring the

279
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:46,780
mysterious girl to Ape Horse for further
examination. As the team tried to determine her

280
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:52,100
origins, portals began opening across Arcadia,
allowing dangerous creatures to enter the

281
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:57,400
territory. One such portal unleashed a mutant
Sentinel, which Ape Horse managed to destroy with

282
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,140
the unexpected help of the mysterious girl.
Medusa immediately accused her of being

283
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:07,160
responsible for the portals, but She-Hulk
refused to accept this claim without proof. When

284
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:12,740
another portal opened, She-Hulk chose to travel
through it, seeking answers. She-Hulk arrived in

285
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,220
the Sentinel territories where she was pursued by
the robots and confronted by members of the Thor

286
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,800
Corps for trespassing across battleworld's
borders. She fought off the Thors and returned to

287
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:28,460
Arcadia, realizing that the portals were created
with magic from Arcadia, suggesting that someone

288
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:33,200
within Ape Horse had betrayed them. Before the
team could investigate further, the Thor Corps

289
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,200
arrived in Arcadia, demanding She-Hulk's
surrender. Medusa sacrificed herself to repel

290
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:44,300
the Thors, buying time for She-Hulk and her allies
to regroup. With the team now branded outlaws,

291
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:50,570
Loki seized the opportunity to climb the portal.
A-Force quickly deduced that Loki was the true

292
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:56,010
traitor responsible for creating the portals to
destabilize She-Hulk's rule. Before she could be

293
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:01,690
crowned Baroness, A-Force launched an attack
exposing her deception. In retaliation, Loki

294
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:07,110
unleashed one final assault, using her powers to
breach the shield barrier, allowing the hordes of

295
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:12,250
undead from the deadlands to invade Arcadia.
A-Force joined by the remaining forces of

296
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:17,350
Arcadia, including the members of the Thorkor,
the X-Men and the Submariner's forces, mounted a

297
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:22,970
desperate defense against the undead. As the
zombies overwhelmed them, the mysterious girl,

298
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:28,810
now named Singularity, sacrificed herself to
save her new friends. She absorbed the horde into

299
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:34,510
the pocket dimension within herself and ascended
into the sky before exploding in a flash of light.

300
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:40,770
The battle was won, but Arcadia had suffered heavy
losses, and A-Force was left forever changed.

301
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:45,210
Following the end of Battleworld and the
restoration of the multiverse, Singularity

302
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:51,110
re-emerged in the primary reality of Earth 616,
but none of the heroes she had known on Battleworld

303
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:56,590
remembered her. Her arrival was detected by Alpha
Flight, whom it took her for a threat. Seeking

304
00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:01,170
familiarity, Singularity located Captain
Marvel, believing her to be the same version she

305
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:06,130
had known back in Arcadia. However, before Carol
Danvers could comprehend what was happening,

306
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:12,310
another cosmic entity named Antimatter arrived,
pursuing Singularity across Earth. Singularity

307
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:16,930
fled to New York City where she encountered
She-Hulk. Recognizing her from Arcadia, she

308
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:22,410
sought her aid, but Antimatter attacked them
both. The Inhuman Queen Medusa intervened with a

309
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:27,530
force of Inhuman soldiers and detained
Singularity, believing her to be a danger. But

310
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:32,530
when Antimatter killed one of the Inhumans,
Medusa, along with She-Hulk, fought back, using

311
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:38,190
Inhuman technology to teleport Antimatter to the
moon to buy themselves time. Realizing the need

312
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:43,110
for a stronger force, Singularity brought the
group to Japan where they enlisted the aid of Niko

313
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:49,210
Minoru. As Antimatter reappeared, Niko used the
staff of one to temporarily banish him. Seeking a

314
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:53,910
more effective means of defeating their foe,
Captain Marvel devised a plan to use concentrated

315
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:59,470
light energy against Antimatter. To implement
this strategy, they sought out Dazzler in Miami

316
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:04,910
and recruited her to join them. Dazzler struck
Antimatter with a powerful burst of light while

317
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:09,350
She-Hulk and Medusa attempted to contain him,
allowing Captain Marvel time to charge a

318
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:14,330
containment device. However, Antimatter proved
too powerful, overloading the system and

319
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:19,370
escaping. Niko then cast a spell to remove
Antimatter's ability to track Singularity,

320
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:24,210
allowing them to regroup aboard the Alpha Flight
Space Station. There, scientists analyzed the

321
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:28,870
data from their Miami battle and developed a
device capable of dismantling Antimatter.

322
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:33,730
However, it was discovered that Antimatter and
Singularity were quantum entangled, meaning

323
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:39,130
that destroying him would also destroy her. Due to
this revelation, She-Hulk attempted to reason

324
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:44,470
with Antimatter, but their negotiations failed.
In retaliation, Antimatter critically wounded

325
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:50,870
Dazzler. Enraged, Singularity blamed herself
and left to confront Antimatter alone. She-Hulk,

326
00:30:50,870 --> 00:30:55,450
Minoru, and Captain Marvel followed her to the
Blue Area of the Moon where Medusa planted a bomb

327
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:00,890
that would destroy Antimatter. As the device
detonated, Dazzler appeared, teleporting

328
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:06,490
Singularity to safety in an act that severed their
entanglement. Antimatter was finally defeated,

329
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:11,630
but the battle had left A-Force shaken. A-Force
remained active for some time, but their battles

330
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:16,890
grew increasingly dire. A-Force found itself
divided by ideological differences during the

331
00:31:16,890 --> 00:31:22,110
Second Superhero Civil War. Captain Marvel,
siding with Ulysses Cain's ability to predict

332
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:27,910
future crimes, turned against Nico Minoru when
the Inhuman Prophet foresaw that she would one day

333
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:33,330
kill a woman named Alice. Nico fled to Ure,
Colorado, where she encountered Elsa

334
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:37,410
Bloodstone, who was battling a monstrous
infestation that was transforming the town's

335
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:42,870
residents into insects. When Alice was found, it
was revealed that she had inadvertently caused

336
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:48,370
the outbreak, and only her death could reverse the
transformation. Nico refused to kill Alice,

337
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:53,450
leading to a deadly confrontation in which her
A-Force teammates, who tracked her to Colorado,

338
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:59,850
were also infected. Ultimately, Nico cast a spell
that took Alice's life undoing the infection. The

339
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:04,570
moral and ideological rift between Captain
Marvel and Nico Minoru deepened following this

340
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:09,570
incident. The strain within the team, coupled
with She-Hulk's temporary retirement and

341
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:15,270
Medusa's departure into space, led to A-Force's
eventual dissolution, and the remaining members

342
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:21,010
drifted apart. Though A-Force no longer operated
as a formal team, their legacy remains to this day

343
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:25,950
in comics as a testament to the strength of the deep
bonds they forged while together. And that's

344
00:32:25,950 --> 00:32:29,870
their backstory. For this team duel,
seven-person roster, I'll be going with some of

345
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:33,670
the primary members of A-Force, along with some of
the members from the team's start and battle

346
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:38,770
worlds that pairs best with your Birds of Prey
team. This was pretty easy, since almost every

347
00:32:38,770 --> 00:32:44,270
Marvel superhero was part of A-Force at that time.
To start with, I went with She-Hulk, Captain

348
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:50,690
Marvel, Spider Woman, Jessica Drew, I should say,
Nico Minoru, and Miss Marvel. All of whom you can

349
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:56,370
learn more about in their own individual duels. I
should note that since our Miss Marvel duel, the

350
00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:01,530
character underwent a slight power upgrade to
match her abilities in the movies and shows. It was

351
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:07,810
revealed that Kamala Khan was an inhuman who
underwent pterogenesis prior to the awakening of

352
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:13,650
her mutant gene, which is the power to create
purple hard-light constructs. Wait, really?

353
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:19,810
Yeah, so she'll be having that power in this duel.
For the final two spots on the A-Force roster, I

354
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:24,430
went with characters who haven't had their own
individual duels, but were prominent heroes that

355
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:30,010
paired well with your team. The first one is
Dazzler, who I'm pairing with your Black Canary.

356
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:35,670
Dazzler is a mutant whose real name is Alice in
Blair, who has the ability to absorb sound

357
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:41,430
vibrations and convert them into light energy,
including lasers, strobes, and all kinds of light

358
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:47,270
effects. She's a singing pop star in the books,
basically the Taylor Swift of comics, and she's

359
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:52,390
famous for using her powers to generate laser
light shows during her concerts. She's been a part

360
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:58,470
of the X-Men and X-Factor, and was shown in live
action in the Dark Phoenix movie played by Halston

361
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:04,110
Sage. For the final spot on the A-Force team, I'm
going with Mockingbird, who I'm pairing against

362
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:10,350
your Huntress. Now Mockingbird is one of Shield's
top spies and scientists with a skill set similar

363
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:16,469
to Black Widows. She's an expert biochemist and
martial artist who famously uses two steel alloy

364
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:22,310
battle staves, or billy clubs, that she can screw
together to extend into a bow staff or vaulting

365
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:27,150
pole. She was a founding member of the West Coast
Avengers, and she's been depicted a few times in

366
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:32,790
live action, first as Hawkeye's Wife, played by
Laura Cardellini in the MCU. The character was

367
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:37,250
also played more accurately, and really to
perfection, in the Agents of Shield television

368
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:45,050
show by Adrian Palakie. So to reiterate, my
7-person roster for A-Force is She-Hulk, Captain

369
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:52,070
Marvel, Ms. Marvel, Spider Woman, Nico Minoru,
Dazzler, and Mockingbird. And since we like to

370
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:57,110
create pairings for these team duels in order to
keep things on an even kill basically and make sure

371
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:02,590
that the matches are fair, the pairings go as
follows. Captain Marvel and Power Girl, She-Hulk

372
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:08,750
and Hawke Girl, Dazzler and Black Canary, Nico
Minoru and Batgirl, Mockingbird and Huntress,

373
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:14,710
Ms. Marvel and Vixen, and Spider Woman and Dove.
Yeah, the Batgirl, Nico pairing kind of throws me,

374
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:19,910
but the rest of them are great, I think. Well, I
figured what Batgirl lacks in powers she makes up

375
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:25,290
in intelligence, and what Nico lacks in
experience she makes up in having a really cool

376
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:31,370
power set. Yeah, well, we'll see how it goes. So you
haven't done duels with Dazzler and Mockingbird.

377
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:36,230
I know about Dazzler, but I didn't know much about
Mockingbird. It sounds like she's essentially

378
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:43,490
just Black Widow who also uses battle staves. Not
commonly, though. Like, I know that in Avengers

379
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:48,790
Age of Ultron, the director, Joss Whedon, gave
Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow these Billy

380
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:52,410
Clubs, and she's really used them in all the
Avengers movies since then, you know, until

381
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:58,410
Avengers Endgame. I feel like he kind of stole them
from Mockingbird in order to make Black Widow a

382
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:03,870
more physical threat against characters like
Ultron. But the Batons, those are typically known

383
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:08,710
to be used by Mockingbird, not Black Widow. I won't
say that she hasn't used, like, tonfas from time to

384
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:14,150
time, but that's really Mockingbird's signature
weapon. Okay, well, I can't wait to find out how

385
00:36:14,150 --> 00:37:09,690
this turns out. So, here's where we're at. We're at
the final stage of the game. Now that we've got

386
00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:13,850
their histories and abilities out of the way,
let's speculate on how one of the thousands of

387
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:19,670
simulated matches will go. The winner is
determined by simulations, not the speculation,

388
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:24,670
but it's fun to imagine how this fight could play
out. Agent NK, what are the rules of our

389
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:50,730
speculation? Well, I should say there are no
rules. The teams must earn victory on their own

390
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:56,610
merit. Alright, then let's get into it. Birds of
Prey and A-Force meet on the battlefield. Who goes

391
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:03,790
first? I think Black Canary would go first. So,
right away, she's gonna blast all of them with a

392
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:10,330
Canary cry, sending all of them flying backward.
No, because Dazzler, she's at the front of the team

393
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:16,410
when this happens, and she's gonna absorb the
entirety of Black Canary's Canary cry. And, like,

394
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:22,950
you just amped Dazzler up to, like, 11. She turns
all of that sound energy into light energy, and she

395
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:28,510
spins around on her roller skates and, you know,
strikes a pose, and she's like, let's go, girls!

396
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:34,810
And, like, cue the EDM music, because this fight
just turned into a dance rave, and A-Force is gonna

397
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:40,310
charge at the Birds of Prey while Dazzler is
shooting out these laser lights, and these lasers

398
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:45,410
are gonna, like, cut Black Girl's utility belt in
half, and one of Hawk Girl's wings just gets

399
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:52,350
clipped, and I'm pretty sure that Power Girl is
bald now. She was given a laser haircut. Okay, I saw

400
00:38:52,350 --> 00:39:01,090
this coming. Not the haircut. I mean, Power Girl
has Kryptonian hair, so... But you're dealing

401
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:07,670
with some of the most agile characters in DC with
the Birds of Prey team. So they're actually

402
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:14,250
dodging Dazzler's lasers with, like, flips and
shit, and Black Girl's gonna counter with a smoke

403
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:20,270
pellet, hiding her team, so Dazzler and the rest of
A-Force can't see where the Birds of Prey are. All

404
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:27,130
they're gonna see is a set of glowing tiger eyes
just before Vixen leaps out of the smoke with a

405
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:34,330
tiger aura, pouncing on Niko Minoru and just
slashing her ribbons. Okay, alright, well, okay.

406
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:39,770
Niko gets hurt, but before she gets turned into
ribbons, that's when She-Hulk leaps in, just

407
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:46,790
straight up grabs Vixen by her waistband and
throws her into space. Okay. And then Niko casts a

408
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:52,270
healing spell on herself using the Staff of One.
She's gonna say, like, Medic, and she's good to go.

409
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:57,650
She's back in this fight. Meanwhile, Captain
Marvel is gonna energize her body to, like, light

410
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:02,970
her way through this smoke screen that Batgirl
created, and she sees Power Girl, and she's gonna

411
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:07,750
give her one of those good old-fashioned
energy-powered punches right in her face,

412
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:13,170
sending her reeling backward. Oh, it's Power
Girl, so yeah, she'll take the punch and then she's

413
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:18,330
gonna give as good as she got right back towards
Captain Marvel, so they're just gonna start

414
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:25,590
trading blows in the sky, I guess. Okay, alright.
Speaking of sky, Miss Marvel is gonna stretch,

415
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:31,490
like, 50 feet tall, and with this embigged hand,
she's just gonna backhand Hawk Girl and swat her

416
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:36,610
out of the sky, sending her crashing into the
ground. Okay, well, yeah, Hawk Girl probably was

417
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:43,630
in the sky, but her enhanced senses actually
alerted her to Miss Marvel's attack, so she's just

418
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:49,990
gonna loop right around that giant hand and slam
Miss Marvel right in the face with her energized

419
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:56,290
mace that's gonna cause her giant body to fall and
crash into the ground. Alright, Miss Marvel's

420
00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:02,770
nose is probably caved in, but she's elastic,
right? So she's gonna topple down to the ground,

421
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:07,710
she catches her fall by creating a purple
construct to cushion it, and while she's, like,

422
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:12,150
reforming her nose, healing that up, she's gonna
throw up another purple energy construct in the

423
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:18,190
air, like a wall that Hawk Girl just flies into,
like a bird into a window, alright, and it just

424
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:23,890
cracks her neck, probably one of her wings. Jeez.
Hawk Girl falls to the ground, like, splat, and she

425
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:31,690
is out of this match. What? Dang, okay. Um, I guess
she's out. Meanwhile, Huntress, she fires a bolt

426
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:37,150
from her crossbow at Mockingbird right through
her foot, and that's gonna pin Mockingbird right

427
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:42,270
to the ground. No, because Mockingbird knocks
this crossbow bolt out of the air with one of her

428
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:48,190
battle staves, and then she's gonna screw her
clubs together to form one long staff that she's

429
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:52,870
gonna use to vault herself over to Huntress and,
like, leap, snap, kick her right in the back of her

430
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:57,650
head. Yeah, except Huntress blocks
Mockingbird's kick with her own bow staff, and the

431
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:03,070
two face off using their own staffs. It's like two
windmills fighting against each other.

432
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:08,750
Eventually, though, Huntress is gonna get in
close enough to fire a quick crossbow bolt point

433
00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:14,990
blank into Mockingbird's chest, eliminating her
from the match. And now Huntress has two staffs

434
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:21,350
that she can dual-wheel like a badass.
Dual-wielding two staffs? Like a badass. But I

435
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:26,750
would really love to see what those bow staffs can
do against someone as durable and strong as Spider

436
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:32,690
Woman, who glides in and she's gonna block
Huntress' staff attack with just her forearm

437
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:37,610
before backflip kicking Huntress right in the
chin with enough strength to knock her

438
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:42,970
unconscious, and now Huntress is out of this
match. So sorry about that fancy dual-wield.

439
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:48,370
Didn't go anywhere. All right, well, I mean, Black
Canary saw what happened to her friend, so she's

440
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:55,130
gonna blast Spider Woman with a targeted Canary
cry that's gonna obliterate her eardrums and just

441
00:42:55,130 --> 00:43:02,270
disorient her. And then Black Canary's gonna grab
Spider Woman with this like Sonia Blade-esque

442
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:08,350
forward handspring leg grapple, and she's gonna
drive Spider Woman's head right into the ground

443
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:14,690
right before she chokes Spider Woman out between
her fishnet clad thighs. Yeah, all right. I think

444
00:43:14,690 --> 00:43:19,930
that is statistically the best way to go out of this
match, except that Spider Woman doesn't get

445
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:26,170
choked out because she emits these pheromones,
right, that pacify Black Canary into loosening

446
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:32,590
her grip. And then Spider Woman just venom blasts
her, stunning her with enough electricity to take

447
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:37,810
her out of the match. Okay, well, Power Girl and
Captain Marvel, you know, they're probably still

448
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:44,350
brawling above the battlefield. And when Miss
Marvel tries to intervene to help her mentor,

449
00:43:44,350 --> 00:43:50,030
Power Girl freezes her with her super breath and
then dashes right through Miss Marvel,

450
00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:55,630
shattering her into a thousand pieces. She's out.
Damn, that's a bold move. Like Captain Marvel,

451
00:43:55,630 --> 00:44:01,430
she's gonna be shocked by that and enraged and
she's gonna straight up super sane Kamehameha

452
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:06,670
Power Girl's ass with a blast that's gonna knock
her down to the ground right into She-Hulk's

453
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:12,090
fists. Okay, that's some A-Force teamwork right
there. And Captain Marvel and She-Hulk are gonna

454
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:17,190
team up and lay a straight up beatdown on Power
Girl, knocking her further and further into a

455
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:22,290
crater that gets deeper with each hit and Power
Girl eventually just goes limp. She can't take any

456
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:27,850
more. She's out. No, dang. All right, well, while
Captain Marvel and She-Hulk are in the hole,

457
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:34,730
Dove's gonna swoop in and emit her pacifying light
aura, which is gonna cause She-Hulk to transform

458
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:40,630
back into Jennifer Walters and Captain Marvel
just, you know, to calm the fuck down. At which

459
00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:47,250
point, Batgirl's gonna drop down a bat grenade
into the crater, which detonates right after Dove

460
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:52,510
flies out of the hole, killing Jennifer. That's
Bird's a prey teamwork. Yeah, I don't like that

461
00:44:52,510 --> 00:45:00,090
teamwork. But, uh, Nico, in retaliation for what
Batgirl did, she's gonna yell out, Basubius, with

462
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:04,690
her staff of one, which is gonna erupt a little
mini-volcano from the ground that's beneath

463
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:10,450
Batgirl and it's gonna explode Batgirl up into the
air and just burn her alive within the fountain of

464
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:15,810
lava. Wait, so there's like lava around the
environment now? Oh, just a pool of it where the

465
00:45:15,810 --> 00:45:23,370
mini-volcano was. Okay. All right, well, Vixen,
she managed to survive space by summoning the

466
00:45:23,370 --> 00:45:30,810
survival abilities of a tardigrade and so she's
fallen back to Earth after She-Hulk's throw and

467
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:38,950
she's gonna summon the power of a falcon to quickly
dive right toward Nico and then at the last minute,

468
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:47,230
harness the weight of a whale to land on Nico who
just splatters everywhere. And meanwhile,

469
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:53,630
Dove's going to blind Spider-Woman with a flash of
light. So now Spider-Woman's blind and deaf, you

470
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:58,850
know, thanks to Black Canaries attack earlier. So
Spider-Woman, she's gonna stubble into that pool

471
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:06,630
of lava from the mini-volcano created by Nico and
just burn to death. Uh, Dazzler then is gonna skate

472
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:12,350
over on her roller skates and we'll say that she
absorbed the sound of the mini-volcano eruption.

473
00:46:12,350 --> 00:46:17,370
So she's juiced, you know, and she fires a light
beam that just punches the hole straight through

474
00:46:17,370 --> 00:46:24,370
Dove's torso and now Dove's out. Now actually,
Dove has a danger sense. So she's gonna dodge

475
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:31,290
Dazzler's attack and then quickly like slide
tackle her legs to trip Dazzler on her skates. So

476
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:38,510
Dazzler just topples face first right onto Hawke
girl's mace and knocks herself out. What? Why are

477
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:44,090
all my guys going out like punk asses? Like, why is
Dove only getting people to take themselves out?

478
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:50,430
Well, she's a pacifist. Okay. Well, you know who's
not a pacifist? Captain Marvel and she's had it

479
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:56,590
with Dove's shit. She's gonna swoop in like a comet
super fast, lift Dove into the sky with her arms

480
00:46:56,590 --> 00:47:03,410
above her head and then straight up dive power bomb
Dove into the ground. She's dead. No, no, Dove has a

481
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:09,090
pacifying aura. Yeah, but Captain Marvel already
knew that from earlier with She-Hulk. So Captain

482
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:15,630
Marvel acted quickly, like I said, a comet like
swoop slam. Whatever. Okay. Captain Marvel, you

483
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:22,230
know, she's gonna look around for the final bird of
prey, which is Vixen. But oh no, looks like she

484
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:28,430
doesn't see her. That's because Vixen is using the
camouflage powers of a squid to make yourself

485
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:34,790
basically invisible. And when Captain Marvel
isn't looking, that's when Vixen combines the

486
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:39,650
abilities of a dung beetle, which is really
strong, like it could lift over 1000 times its

487
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:46,990
weight and a mantis shrimp, which could strike at
the speed of a bullet to land a killing blow right in

488
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:53,590
the back of Captain Marvel's head. Boom, match
over. How many animals is Vixen using for this move

489
00:47:53,590 --> 00:48:01,210
here? Three. Mantis shrimp and a dung beetle?
Yeah, it's pretty shitty. Literally. Okay.

490
00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:06,610
Captain Marvel feels this little love tap on the
back of her head and she's gonna turn around like,

491
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:13,770
bitch. And then she's gonna fly and uppercut Vixen
into Red Mist. That's how the match ends. Love tap.

492
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:18,590
Dude, do not underestimate the power of the mantis
shrimp. It's called a shrimp for a reason. All

493
00:48:18,590 --> 00:48:23,890
right. It's shrimpy. Right. It's not going to hurt
Captain Marvel proportionately. Yes, the hell it

494
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:30,270
is. Okay. Well, we'll go ahead and leave the match
there. Either Vixen mantis shrimp dung beetle

495
00:48:30,270 --> 00:48:37,430
punches Captain Marvel on the back of the head, or
Captain Marvel literally just uppercuts Vixen,

496
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:41,710
exploding her into oblivion. Let's go ahead and
input the stats for these teams, run the

497
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:48,490
simulations and find out which scenario happens.
Agenenke, hit it. Inputting data, running

498
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:55,030
calculations, processing results, simulations
complete. All right. Full disclosure, guys. For

499
00:48:55,030 --> 00:49:00,010
this particular matchup, a lot of the executive
producers weren't convinced that the Birds of

500
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:05,710
Prey were going to be powerful enough to go up
against a force. So at one point, we thought it

501
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:12,710
might work to have Jessica Cruz on the Birds of Prey
team, which I didn't love because Jessica Cruz has

502
00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:17,150
never been a member of the Birds of Prey. But we
thought it would help balance things out. Yeah.

503
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:22,370
When we ran the stats though, like Green Lanterns
are so impressive statistically that not only did

504
00:49:22,370 --> 00:49:27,930
Jessica Cruz end up being the most powerful member
out of either of the teams, but she also raised the

505
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:33,350
value of the team to the point where it was unfair.
Because despite what people may think, Birds of

506
00:49:33,350 --> 00:49:38,330
Prey are quite impressive statistically, at
least when it comes to fighting skill and

507
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:43,350
intelligence and perception. Yeah, they're
pretty well rounded characters, which was

508
00:49:43,350 --> 00:49:48,930
surprising to see. Like you definitely had the
most powerful character out of either team in

509
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:54,030
Captain Marvel. And for the most part, like your
characters were way stronger than mine in terms of

510
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:57,850
strength and damage. Yeah, that's definitely
what my team excelled at, especially with

511
00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:03,850
characters like Dazzler and Nico Minoru and Ms.
Marvel. They were really good in terms of like

512
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:10,390
range and damage potential and not a whole lot
else. Although because of Ms. Marvel's construct

513
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:16,270
shielding and Dazzler's energy shielding and
Nico Minoru's magic shields, A-Force did come out

514
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:23,110
slightly ahead in evasiveness. I didn't use
nearly enough shields in that speculation. But

515
00:50:23,110 --> 00:50:28,490
thankfully my team was faster and more
perceptive. Yeah, in terms of speed, you had Power

516
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:34,250
Girl and Dove who are like really fucking fast.
Also, Hawk Girl was really fast and so was Vixen.

517
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:40,450
Really the fastest person on my team was Captain
Marvel and everybody else was just okay in terms of

518
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:45,370
movement speed. When it came to perception, like
you said, Power Girl has multiple advanced

519
00:50:45,370 --> 00:50:50,410
senses. So does Vixen. Dove has her dangerous
sense. And the ladies in A-Force, you know, you

520
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:55,150
have Spider Woman with her acute hearing and
Captain Marvel with her cosmic awareness. But

521
00:50:55,150 --> 00:51:00,130
everybody else on my team basically just had their
eyes and ears. Right. So taking all of this into

522
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:06,970
account, Joseph, who do you think came out on top?
A-Force. Final answer. I think Instagram is

523
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:14,990
backing me up on this one too. They are. I put the
poll up pretty late, but so far it looks like 62% of

524
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:20,250
our Instagram followers who voted are siding with
A-Force. But let's see if they actually get the

525
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:29,050
win. NK, the results please. Here you are, sir. The
winner of the TeamDuel matchup between Birds of

526
00:51:29,050 --> 00:51:39,950
Prey and A-Force is Birds of Prey. Bullshit.
Bullshit. Birds of Prey, motherfucker. Run the

527
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:47,390
stats again. Run them again. We already ran
thousands. How is that possible? I am as surprised

528
00:51:47,390 --> 00:51:54,710
as you are. But it looks like based on these
results, Birds of Prey wins 51.4% of the matches

529
00:51:54,710 --> 00:52:04,270
compared to A-Force who won 48.6. That's really
close. I still don't buy it. Not going to lie, I did

530
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:09,910
not see this coming. My guys are powerful. Yeah,
your guys are smarter, but what are they going to

531
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:16,090
do? Just like outsmart my guys? Well, it looks like
the biggest discrepancy came down to fighting

532
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:22,790
skill. Like, my guys are way better fighters. Some
of the best fighters in DC with characters like

533
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:29,330
Black Canary. Well, I have Mockingbird on my team.
And? She's the best fighter on my team. But why do

534
00:52:29,330 --> 00:52:35,150
you need fighting skill when you have raw energy
power? Why do you need raw energy power when you

535
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:42,470
have raw intelligence? Backroll was by far the
smartest member out of either team. She really

536
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:47,930
leveled up my team in that regard. And actually,
one of Dove's superpowers is that she has enhanced

537
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:53,970
intelligence. It just makes me think that while
the final results were close, Birds of Prey were

538
00:52:53,970 --> 00:53:00,790
able to execute teamwork, cheap shot tactics over
the A-Force who isn't quite as cohesive a team,

539
00:53:00,790 --> 00:53:06,510
maybe. Yeah, well, I mean, if I had to choose a team
leader between Batgirl and She-Hulk, it would

540
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:12,810
definitely be Batgirl. She's much more of a
strategic mind. Well, She-Hulk won a little over

541
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:18,770
half of all of her matches, whereas Batgirl won
just over a third of her matches. Actually, the

542
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:24,190
person with the highest win rate was Captain
Marvel, winning a little over 84% of all of her

543
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:29,930
fights, followed by Powergirl, who won 80%. Which
makes sense, because like I have She-Hulk on my

544
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:33,930
team, Captain Marvel, they'll definitely put up
more of a fight than some of my other characters.

545
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:38,910
You also had the character with the lowest win
rate, which was Mockingbird. That's right, she

546
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:43,270
really dragged down my team, for sure. I think
maybe I should have replaced her with someone

547
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:48,130
else. How am I going to bring a chicken to this fight
with two metal poles going up against essentially

548
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:54,750
Supergirl? Yeah, the original Supergirl. I don't
know what to say, man. I eeked this one out, but boy,

549
00:53:54,750 --> 00:54:01,350
am I glad I did. Here's to all the Lady DC fans. This
one's for you. For Women's History Month, DC is

550
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:07,590
going down in history as the winners. It's not
history in March, man. It's called herstory.

551
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:37,230
Okay? Get it right. That does it for this duel. A.J.
and N.K. help close us out. Don't forget to listen

552
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:41,930
to the other shows in the Dynamite podcast
network, including Max Destruction, Senjo

553
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:49,990
World, and Console Combat. In our next episode, we
will be doing a review. This time of the

554
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:56,550
direct-to-video DC animated film Batman Ninja
vs. Yakuza League. I cannot wait to see it. I've

555
00:54:56,550 --> 00:55:01,770
been looking forward to this for a long time. I
think it's going to be fun. I hope it sucks, but that

556
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:05,170
does it for this episode. We want to give a big
thanks to our executive producers, John

I love women's.
