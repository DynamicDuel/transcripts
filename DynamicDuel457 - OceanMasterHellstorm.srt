00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,340
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi, welcome to
the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:31,840
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,600
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe and I'm his twin

4
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,000
brother Johnny DC. And in this episode, we're
going to find out who'd win in a fight between the

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,160
two trident-wielding badasses, Ocean Master,
who's an Aquaman villain, and Hellstorm, who is a

6
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,460
sometimes lord of hell and then sometimes hero.
It's a little bit strange. Yeah, actually

7
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,240
sometimes Ocean Master is somewhat heroic, you
know, when he's acting for the benefit of

8
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,000
Atlantis. Yeah, I don't know if I would call them
anti-heroes. I guess at one point Hellstorm was an

9
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,200
anti-hero, but I think I would consider them more
anti-villains, if that's even a term. If not, I

10
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,660
just coined it. I want a quarter every time
somebody says it. So now no one's gonna say it.

11
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,920
Either way, we're gonna find out who's gonna win in
this matchup later on this episode. Before we do

12
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,860
that, we're gonna break down the latest comic book
movie news from this past week, of which there was

13
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:28,920
no news, so I take back what I just said. But as
always, we list our segment times in our episode

14
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,860

quick to the no prize. A no prize is an award that

34
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,780
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version, the
Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award we post on

35
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:32,420
Instagram for the person that we feel gave the best
answer to our question of the week. Last week we

36
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:37,340
asked you guys, besides Batman, Spider-Man, and
Wolverine, which Marvel or DC character do you

37
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:42,240
most want to play as in a single player adventure
video game? And this was coming off of the trailer

38
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,220
that we received for the upcoming Marvel's
Wolverine action adventure game that's coming

39
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,840
out for the PS5 next year. We got a whole lot of
answers for this one, so let's go ahead and run down

40
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,700
our three honorable mentions as well as the no
prize winner. Our first honorable mention goes to

41
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:04,460
Kyo, who said, Hi guys, I was watching a CW flash
show the other day, and I was thinking how cool a

42
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:11,240
flash video game would be. Like the map traversal
would be pretty cool since it has super speed, and

43
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:17,800
then maybe the combat could have some moves like
the fear multi-takedown from the Batman Arkham

44
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:23,760
Knight game. But yeah, that's my answer. Also, why
are you going to review your friendly

45
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,540
neighborhood Spider-Man? We're not. We have too
many duels to get through before the end of the

46
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:34,720
show. But as far as a flash video game goes, I
imagine that the entire game would almost have to

47
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,660
be in bullet time, like slow motion, right, for it
to make sense. Maybe, so there was a

48
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:47,100
side-scrolling flash video game for the Game Boy
Advance. It was a Justice League Heroes tie-in,

49
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,400
but specifically for the character of the flash. I
don't know if you could do a flash game in 3D, but I

50
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,940
think if you made one that was like Sonic the
Hedgehog, just really fast-paced, you would

51
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,860
definitely need some homing attacks just because
I feel like with his speed, it would be really easy

52
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,620
to lose control of the character. But it could be
really cool. Yeah, I mean like Sonic has homing

53
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:11,780
attacks, so yeah, true. That would be badass. The
flash came in the style of Sonic the Hedgehog. Hell

54
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:17,860
yeah. Great answer, Kyle. Our next honorable
mention goes to Travis Herndon, who said, What's

55
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,520
up, the name of the dude is Travis here. Shout out to
my evil twin. So my pick would be Ghost Rider. I

56
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:28,980
mean, come on, Ghost Rider is a cool superhero. He
has a badass rogues gallery that can easily fit

57
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:35,300
into a game. And then you can either choose between
Johnny Blaze, Danny Ketch, Robbie Reyes, and just

58
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,640
go around fighting demons on a motorcycle or a
demonic charger. I mean, come on, that speaks for

59
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,860
itself. So yeah, my pick would be Ghost Rider. Hell
yeah, bro. You see what I did right there? Hell

60
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:51,900
yeah. That would be a great video game. I would love
a Ghost Rider game to be in the action-adventure

61
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,440
style video game. Kind of like Spider-Man and the
upcoming Wolverine game, but also have like

62
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,960
almost racing levels. I guess it wouldn't quite be
racing. It would be more like motorcycle combat,

63
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,660
which I think you could develop a really cool
fighting system based off of like high speed chase

64
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,540
fighting. I would love a game like that. Like some
adventures would be maybe in the desert, some

65
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:18,220
would be in the city, someone maybe even be in hell
and like hell landscapes where like you like ramp

66
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:25,400
off of things and jump over lakes of fire and do
loop-to-loops or shit. I don't think it would look

67
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,000
really cool in a video game. I mean, you kind of sold
me on the racing aspect. I think that'd be really

68
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,060
cool. Great answer, Travis. Our next honorable
mention goes to Frank, who said? Hey guys, a type of

69
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:43,800
video game I would like to see is a blade video game.
It's the obvious answer. You either go in with the

70
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:50,460
bad assery and get a hack and slash like Devil May
Cry, or you focus on the vampire horror and make it

71
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:58,120
like Resident Evil. It's just the obvious answer.
Absolutely. I think blade would be made for the

72
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,020
hack and slash genre. Very similar to Devil May
Cry. Just put it in a whole horde of vampires and

73
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:09,580
then just like Dynasty Warriors that shit, right?
That would be such a cool game. That would be

74
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:15,600
awesome. There was like a blade to video game that I
remember owning for the PS2 way back in the day in

75
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:21,180
the early aughts. It was so bad, but most movie
adaptations around that time were also bad,

76
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:28,800
except for Spider-Man 2. That was a great video
game. I think blade is rife for a new video game

77
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,960
undertaking in the single-player
action-adventure hack and slash genre. Dude, so

78
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:40,220
many video game characters are ripe for a video
game adaptation. If it's true what they say that,

79
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:45,340
you know, they're superhero movie fatigue, I hope
there's not superhero video game fatigue. And

80
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:50,940
that just continues to get better and better. Like
DC Studios is a division dedicated just to movies.

81
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:57,720
They need a DC division dedicated just to video
games. Well, Marvel has a Marvel Games division

82
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:04,520
because we have our shit together. Okay, look at
you. Hey, hi. Bragging piece of shit. Great

83
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,040
answer, Frank. We want to give a quick shout out to
Sheldon Moore and Lorenzo Valdes for taking the

84
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:14,060
time to call in with your answer. But the winner of
this week's snow prize is actually split between

85
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:20,540
two people, Alex Albro and Ryzeal, who gave the
same answer. And that is... Hey guys, I think Green

86
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,040
Lantern has a really good argument for a video
game. Starting on Earth, inevitably you get the

87
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,440
ring and then you leave Earth patrolling all the
sectors of the universe. And as you interact with

88
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,720
different Green Lanterns and different Lanterns
of different color spectrums, and as you defeat

89
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:37,919
more villains, you gain more abilities, more
power, I think each sector could have a different

90
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:42,360
style of gameplay and a different villain,
different power ups. And it's not necessarily

91
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,160
endless, but it has a lot of meat on the bone for a
good campaign. Thanks guys. Hey guys, Ryzeal

92
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,740
here. I'm thinking an RPG action game where like a
normal game would have mana, you have to pay

93
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:58,000
attention to do this one is battery level instead.
You make your constructs with templates

94
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,040
beforehand where you can make whatever you want.
But the more pieces you use, like Lego style, the

95
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,100
more battery it's going to use while you're out on
actual mission. Once the, you know, you run out of

96
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,960
battery, you just go back and have to start over or
you fail that one. Or you have to take time to save

97
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,140
the oath, which is really long, and you're
probably going to get your ass kicked as you're

98
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:23,000
doing it. We got to run home and grab your battery
first, and then say the oath. Oh yeah. Both these

99
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,600
guys gave great ideas for both the story and
mechanics of a Green Lantern action adventure

100
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:35,100
video game. I really love how Alex focused on how
like you unlock new moves as you go along and meet

101
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,400
different lanterns among the different
spectrums. And then Ryzeal came in with the whole

102
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:45,060
construct building mechanic. I think both of
those are brilliant. I think Warner Brothers is

103
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:50,400
fucking stupid for not having made this game
already because it literally sounds like money

104
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,460
waiting on the table. Yeah, talk about an open
world game. How about an open universe game where

105
00:09:55,460 --> 00:10:01,340
you could go to different planets? That's wild.
Like you think about like the build system in games

106
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:06,820
like Fortnite or even probably more apt Breath of
the Wild and the recent tears of the kingdom for

107
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:12,220
Legend of Zelda. How you could basically build all
these creative things. Do that for Green Lantern.

108
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,940
That's his whole concept. Yeah, and you can make
the planet small. It's like you don't even need to

109
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:20,860
include Earth in a video game like this. Just
include a whole bunch of small planets. Right,

110
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:26,360
yeah. So throwing a little bit of like loose
gravity, like Super Mario Galaxy. I mean, it's

111
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,280
just a fantastic game idea. You know, it was a
really cool DC game that they actually could have

112
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:35,340
made into solely a Green Lantern game?
Scribbleknot's Unmasked. And in that game, you

113
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:40,280
can create anything just by typing in a prompt. Oh,
well, it doesn't make for the most fast paced

114
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,260
gameplay, but it's an opportunity to be really
creative and solve challenges with your

115
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:50,020
creativity. I'm there for it. Yeah, you just
introduced the idea of puzzle elements within

116
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:55,180
this game. There's just so much there with the
Green Lantern video game. It's ripe. It's there

117
00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:02,100
for the picking DC. Take it. It would be way better
than anything Marvel could do. No, no, I don't

118
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:07,540
think so. That's not right. Sorry, but it's true.
Great answer either way, Alex and Ryzeal. You guys

119
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:12,200
win this week's Snow Prize. If you the listener
want to shout at winning your own No Prize, stay

120
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,840
tuned until later on in this episode when we'll be
asking another question of the week. And now that

121
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:26,620
that's done onto the question of the week. For the
Halloween season coming up here, what do you think

122
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:33,740
has been the scariest moment in a Marvel or DC film
or TV series? We're talking about the moments that

123
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:38,780
made you shit your pants or jump out of your seat or
jump out of your seat because you shit your pants.

124
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:43,340
We want to hear about it. I mean, not you shitting
your pants, but about the moment. Go ahead and

125
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,020
record your answer at dynamicduel.com by
clicking on the red microphone button in the

126
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:51,060
bottom right hand corner of the screen, which will
prompt you to leave us a voicemail. Your message

127
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,760
could be up to 30 seconds long and don't forget to
leave your name in case we include you on the

128
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,700
podcast. We'll make our favorite answer and award
that person a Dynamic Duel No Prize that will post

129
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:11,620
to Instagram. Be sure to answer before October
11th. But I think we'll go ahead and get into the

130
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,260
main event for this episode now, where we find out
who would win in a fight between the Aquaman

131
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:37,000
villain, Ocean Master, and one of the Lords of Hell
for Marvel, Hellstorm. All right, Ocean Master

132
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,920
versus Hellstorm. Now, the reason we decided to do
this matchup was one due to the executive

133
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:48,000
producers who thought this might make for a good
Halloween duel, considering Hellstorm is one of

134
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,740
the Lords of Hell in Marvel. And, you know, Ocean
Master, he's not like scary in a Halloween sense,

135
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:59,060
but he is a villain. So there's that whole dark,
evil aspect going there. So yeah, I think this is a

136
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:03,300
good Halloween episode. Yeah, both of the
characters are like the sorcerers who carry

137
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:08,440
tridents, essentially. Plus, you got the whole
water versus fire dynamic going on. It's pretty

138
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,120
cool, I think. I was excited when I heard this
matchup come up. Yeah, same. Both of these

139
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,920
characters have had live action, film, and
television appearances. Hellstorm actually had

140
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,060
his own series on Hulu called Hellstrom. Now, they
kind of played it out very differently than it is in

141
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,980
the comics. They really focused on his
supernatural detective era from the comic books.

142
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:33,460
But Ocean Master was pretty accurately depicted
in the Aquaman films, I feel, by Patrick Wilson.

143
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:38,000
Yeah, I would say they did a really good job
adapting Orm, for sure. But before we get into the

144
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,280
match to explain the methodology behind our
duels, let's go to our sentient duel simulator,

145
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:49,420
Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ9K, tell our listeners how
you go about determining a winner in our duel

146
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:55,000
matchups. Yes, of course, sir. The way I determine
a winner between the contestants is by running

147
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,280
1000 Monte Carlo simulations using the
characters statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation

148
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,700
is a probabilistic model used to determine
outcomes through random sampling. In this case, I

149
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,860
randomize the statistics along a normal
distribution as a way to simulate the many

150
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:14,800
variables that can occur during battle. The stat
parameters are based on the official Marvel power

151
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:23,800
grid from which the DC characters statistics are
extrapolated. Additional versatility and

152
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,260
perception in order to create a more detailed and
accurate simulation. The results of the 1000

153
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:33,820
simulations provide a percentage of wins for each
character. The contestant with the higher

154
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:39,360
percentage is declared the victor as they have a
higher probability to win any given battle. In an

155
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,780
equitable pairing, neither character should win
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have

156
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:49,640
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat
Superman. So the confidence rate of my method

157
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,700
falls in line with the precedents that have been
established in the source material. My

158
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,160
mathematical simulations are without
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole

159
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:04,720
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K.

160
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,000
Before we run the simulations, though, we'd like
to break down each of the characters' histories

161
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,020
and abilities before improvising a scenario on
how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations would

162
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:18,720
play out beat for beat. And it's my turn to go first
with the DC characters backstory, so let me tell

163
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:25,900
you all about Ocean Master. Orm Marius was born to
the Atlantean Wizard King, King Atlan, and an

164
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:31,760
Inupia woman from the Arctic Circle. Though
Atlantean, Orm was raised far from the undersea

165
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,600
realm among the icy northern tribes of his
mother's people, he grew up restless and

166
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:43,160
alienated, a misfit in a world of tradition. His
mother often spoke of the sea and of the father who

167
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,780
had vanished beneath it, filling Orm's
imagination with dreams of a forgotten kingdom

168
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:53,760
that he believed was his birthright. When a young
Arthur Curry rescued Orm's cousin Kako from a

169
00:15:53,760 --> 00:16:00,180
polar bear attack, the outcast Inupia saw in the
blonde stranger everything he lacked, strength,

170
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:05,840
charisma, and acceptance. Orm watched his people
embrace Arthur with warmth they had never shown

171
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:11,940
him. Jealousy festered until, in a moment of rage,
he attacked Kako after learning she had grown

172
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:17,680
close to the outsider. Though she survived, her
memory of the assault was lost, and Arthur was

173
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,500
blamed and cast out for bringing a curse upon the
village. Orm's hatred deepened, and when

174
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,860
Whispers of Atlantis reached him through magic
and legend, he abandoned the surface to find the

175
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:35,400
kingdom of his bloodline. He re-emerged years
later as Ocean Master, a pirate sorcerer wielding

176
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:41,000
the dark gifts inherited from his father's
lineage. Neither he nor Arthur yet knew they were

177
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,640
bound by Atlan's prophecy that his sons would one
day battle for dominion over the seas. You can

178
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:53,060
learn more about Arthur in our Aquaman vs
Submariner dual episode. Ocean Master's rise

179
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:58,860
began with fleets of submersibles and legions of
mercenaries who plundered the oceans, attacking

180
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:04,260
ships in coastal cities in his quest to force the
world to acknowledge his supremacy. His growing

181
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:09,339
collection of Atlantean relics and increasing
mastery of ancient sorcery grew with each

182
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:15,460
conquest, making him a formidable foe even to
Aquaman. Their first clashes revealed uncanny

183
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:20,319
similarities between them, strength,
willpower, and the same innate connection to the

184
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,500
sea. Though neither man understood their bond at
first, Arthur later uncovered the truth

185
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:32,060
throughout Atlantean records and realized that
Orm was his half-brother, the second son of Atlan.

186
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:37,720
Driven by envy and destiny, Orm became obsessed
with claiming the throne of Atlantis. To augment

187
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,980
his power, he sought forbidden sources of magic
and made a pact with the demon lord Neron, selling

188
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:49,600
his soul for an enchanted trident. The weapon
magnified his control over the elements,

189
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,800
allowing him to summon lightning and tempests,
but accursed him with unending pain whenever he

190
00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:00,840
was separated from it, scarring his face and
warping his mind. With his new power, Orm

191
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:06,260
conquered the Dreaming City, an Atlantean
offshoot civilization and enslaved its

192
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:11,680
citizens. Aquaman confronted Orm, revealing
their shared parentage, but the revelation

193
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:17,360
shattered Orm's sanity. The trident's magic
burned through him, leaving him disfigured and

194
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,300
broken. In time, Orm recovered, turning his
intellect and sorcery toward manipulation and

195
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:28,500
conquest from the shadows. He joined Lux Luthor's
and Justice Gang and later the Seeker Society of

196
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:33,040
Super-Villains, forming alliances with other
enemies of the Justice League to extend his

197
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,860
influence beyond the seas. When Atlantis
suffered devastation from the wrath of the

198
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:44,060
Spectre, Orm enslaved the survivors, forcing
them to mine resources for his undersea empire.

199
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:49,220
His rule was merciless, his ambition
unrelenting, and his hatred for Aquaman only

200
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:54,900
deepened as the world continued to favor his
brother as its champion. Ocean Master's sorcery

201
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:00,340
reached its peak when he used a spell focused
through the bones of Aquaman's lost hand to

202
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:07,300
rewrite reality itself, exchanging identities
with his brother. In this false world, Orm ruled

203
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:13,520
Atlantis as its beloved king while Arthur, cursed
with Ocean Master's memories, was hunted as a

204
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:18,880
villain. For a time, Orm reveled in the adoration
and power he believed he deserved, yet the

205
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:25,200
illusion unraveled when Dr. Geist, a human
scientist known to Orm, revealed the deception.

206
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:30,580
Aquaman destroyed the spell's anchor, restoring
reality and leaving Orm once more stripped of the

207
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:36,300
throne he coveted. Orm later resurfaced within
the ranks of the Seeker Society's inner circle and

208
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:42,820
clashed repeatedly with both the Justice League
and his half-brother. As the age of magic shifted,

209
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:49,360
Orm enslaved what remained of Atlantis' people
again, orging a brutal new kingdom in the ruins.

210
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:55,520
When the magic wars consumed the oceanic world,
Orm was thought dead, but he survived, retreating

211
00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,800
into the shadows to await another opportunity to
reclaim what he believed was his destiny. In

212
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:07,040
post-Flashpoint continuity, Orm was born the son
of Queen Atlanta and the Atlantean warlord Orvex

213
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:13,020
Marius, raised as a prince in the royal palace and
unaware that his mother had once born another son

214
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:18,600
with his service man Tom Curry. When he learned
that Arthur Curry, the so-called Aquaman, was his

215
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:24,980
half-brother, Orm grew conflicted. He loved his
brother and wished to reunite their family, but he

216
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:30,280
despised the surface world for its pollution and
arrogance. His father's militarism and his

217
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:36,220
mother's mysterious death hardened him into a
ruler who valued order above compassion. When

218
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:41,580
Arthur discovered Atlantis with the exiled
Volko's help, Orm welcomed him and briefly seeded

219
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:46,540
the throne, believing his brother's rule could
unite their divided worlds. But when the surface

220
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:52,540
launched missiles that accidentally struck near
Atlantis, Orm perceived it as an attack. Acting on

221
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:58,300
old war plans, he and Arthur had drafted together.
He unleashed devastating floods upon the coasts

222
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:04,220
of Boston, Metropolis, and Gotham, killing
thousands. Declaring war on the surface, he led

223
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:09,740
Atlantean armies to battle until the Justice
League intervened. Aquaman pleaded with Orm to

224
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:15,160
stop, but when the truth came to light that Volko
had manipulated events to restore Arthur to

225
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:21,280
power, Orm was defeated and taken to the surface
for trial. Stripped of his crown and imprisoned in

226
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,960
Bel-Riv, he came to despise the name Ocean Master,
a mocking title given to him by the surface media.

227
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,840
During a global crisis brought by the crime
syndicate, Orm escaped to sell and wander to the

228
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:38,740
surface, where he saved a woman named Erin Shaw and
her young son Tommy from Rioters. He found solace

229
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:43,400
in their companionship, living quietly as a
father figure and telling the boy stories of the

230
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:49,960
sea. Years later, when he learned Atlantis was
again at war and Aquaman presumed dead, Orm left

231
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:56,320
them behind to reclaim his throne. He confronted
Mera and Tula on the surface, demanding Atlantis'

232
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:02,800
crown, but Mera defeated him in battle using her
hydrokinetic powers. Imprisoned once more, Orm

233
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:09,060
was freed when alien sea gods invaded and
transformed Atlantis' citizens into monsters.

234
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:14,380
Fighting alongside Mera, he helped her seek an
artifact capable of killing gods, but was himself

235
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:19,600
corrupted by the invaders' waters and
transformed into one of their servants. After the

236
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,500
gods' defeat, Orm returned to his senses, hunted
by what he had become. In the aftermath, he

237
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:31,180
vanished into the lower depths of Atlantis,
living among the destitute of the 9th tribe. There

238
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:37,500
he learned of the legend of King Dagon, a forgotten
monarch who once ruled the oceans through a bound

239
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:43,880
elemental named Lernaea. Pursuing the myth, Orm
descended into the oceans of Biss and found the

240
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:49,940
imprisoned Lernaea herself. Fraying her from her
bonds, he gained her loyalty and founded a new

241
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:56,100
kingdom for the displaced and the damned, the city
of Dagon. Rejecting overtures from Apex Lux

242
00:22:56,100 --> 00:23:01,280
Luthor to join the Legion of Doom, Orm instead
built his own domain, declaring independence

243
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:06,220
from both Atlantis and the surface world. When he
returned to the surface to explain his

244
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:11,160
disappearance to Eren, she rejected him,
unwilling to live in the shadow of his war like

245
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:16,980
ambitions. Orm left heartbroken, but vowed one
day to offer Tommy the chance to succeed him as King

246
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:23,220
of Dagon. From the deaths of his new city, Orm began
plotting once more, gathering outcasts and

247
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:29,120
mutants to his cause. When Queen Mera fell into a
coma, he sought to exploit the power vacuum,

248
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,660
manipulating Dagon's populace and even
orchestrating the abduction of Aquaman and his

249
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:40,210
daughter to discredit her rule. His deception was
exposed and his elemental ally turned to Against

250
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:46,530
him, forcing Orm to concede defeat and accept
Mera's plan to abolish Atlantis' monarchy.

251
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:52,010
Though stripped of power yet again, he remained in
the shadows, commanding loyalty among those who

252
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:57,310
believed in his vision of an ocean ruled by
strength and purity. In the years that followed,

253
00:23:57,310 --> 00:24:03,230
Orm allied with the scavenger and other undersea
warlords to destabilize Atlantis, seeking to

254
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:09,150
resurrect his empire through subterfuge and
terror. Napaurs wise, as a pure-blooded

255
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:15,410
Atlantean of royal descent, Ocean Master
possesses immense strength, speed, durability,

256
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:20,970
and stamina, allowing him to survive the crushing
pressure and fragile darkness of the deep ocean.

257
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:26,630
His enhanced senses grant perfect vision in the
blackest depths and hearing capable of detecting

258
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:32,990
movement miles away. A skilled tactician and
warrior, Orm is trained in all forms of Atlantean

259
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:39,250
combat and command. His enchanted trident,
forged in Atlantis, channels lightning,

260
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:45,570
conjures storms, and focuses his arcane power,
while his royal mask crown amplifies his

261
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:52,030
hydrokinesis, enabling him to command the tides
and summon devastating tsunamis. And that's

262
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:57,050
Ocean Master. He's not that scary. I don't know if
this is a good Halloween episode after all. Oh, I'm

263
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:02,170
sorry. There's nothing scarier than the ocean,
bro. Do you know what's down there? Freaking no one

264
00:25:02,170 --> 00:25:06,310
does. You go down there and you see him? Yeah,
you're going to be shitting yourself in that

265
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:11,170
water. I can think of a lot of things underneath the
water that would make me shit my pants more than

266
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:16,330
some dude wearing a goofy-looking helmet. That
being said, one of my most frequent recurring

267
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:21,910
nightmares is one of a tidal wave. Oh, really?
That's interesting. You know what that means,

268
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:29,830
right? What? It means that you have poor taste in
comic books. What? Yes. Science. I think it means

269
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:34,450
that I have awesome taste in comic books. I'm just
like swimming in all the awesomeness that is

270
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:38,110
Marvel. Is that what happens in your dream? The
tidal wave crashes on you and you're just

271
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:45,130
swimming? No. Yeah. It's more like I'm trying to
get to higher ground and run, basically. Anyway,

272
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:50,630
enough about that. Let's go ahead and get into the
backstory for Hellstorm. Damon Hellstrom was

273
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:55,590
born in Green Town, Massachusetts, the son of
Victoria Wingit and the hell lord who called

274
00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:02,130
himself Satan. Victoria's parents had sold her to
the Chapel of Dresden, a fanatical occult sect

275
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:08,970
once allied with Nazi Germany who hoped to bring
about a messianic human demon hybrid. Rituals and

276
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:14,890
glyphs were carved into Victoria's body to
prepare her as a vessel and when Satan came to earth

277
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:21,550
in human guise, he seduced and married her. The two
settled in Massachusetts where Damon was born a

278
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:27,510
year later. Damon's infancy was marked by
sinister conditioning. He was fed human blood and

279
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:32,490
marked with a pentagram birthmark. His father's
interest soon shifted to his younger sister,

280
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:38,630
Satan, born three years later who proved more
receptive to his teachings. Damon meanwhile

281
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:44,130
bonded with his mother, never fully aware of his
father's identity. When their mother witnessed

282
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:50,370
Satan's true demonic form, she was driven insane
and the children were separated. Victoria was

283
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:56,350
institutionalized. Satan, taken to hell to be
raised by her father, and Damon placed in an

284
00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:01,770
orphanage. On visits, his mother entrusted him
with an onc pendant claiming it was his sole

285
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:07,590
protection against Satan. She also revealed the
existence of Nethraeneum, a rare infernal metal

286
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:13,770
capable of harming his father. As Damon matured,
he pursued theology, studying under Father

287
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:18,970
Raymond Gosset in a Jesuit monastery. He prepared
for ordination but turned away from the

288
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:23,630
priesthood when his mother died and he inherited
the Massachusetts estate. Exploring the

289
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:28,990
mansion, Damon discovered her diary, confirming
his lineage. He was drawn to the portal in the

290
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:34,070
basement leading to hell where Satan revealed
himself and offered Damon eternal life and power

291
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:40,110
if he served him. Damon refused, instead stealing
his father's trident forged of Nethraeneum and

292
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:46,230
his Damon-drawn chariot escaping back to earth.
He also discovered the powers of his dark soul, the

293
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:51,190
infernal inherited energy that granted him great
magical might. So, wearing to fight his father's

294
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:56,770
evil, Damon became the hero called Son of Satan. He
balanced his civilian life as a scholar of the

295
00:27:56,770 --> 00:28:01,790
occult with his secret role as an exorcist and
demon fighter. Damon assisted Linda

296
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:06,250
Littletrees, the witch woman, which led to his
first team up with Ghost Rider against Satan

297
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:11,310
himself. He clashed with demonic beings such as
German X-D's and Cathara and even battled his

298
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:16,810
sister Satan when she surfaced on earth as a
succubus. He grew known as a leading demonologist

299
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:21,610
and frequently collaborated with superheroes
including the Fantastic Four. His reputation

300
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:26,590
grew when he joined the defenders, assisting them
against the alien Nebulon, the Sons of the

301
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:31,470
Serpent, and the demonic alliance known as the
Six-Fingered Hand, whose manipulations nearly

302
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:37,130
merged earth with hell. During his tenure with the
defenders, Damon fell in love with teammate Patsy

303
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:42,770
Walker, aka Hellcat whom you can learn more about
in her duel with Catwoman. The relationship was

304
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:48,850
tested by his father, who transformed Patsy into a
demon to torment him. Damon agreed to stay in hell

305
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:54,230
to secure her freedom, but ultimately rebelled
and returned to earth. Rejoining the defenders,

306
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,830
he fought alongside them against threats
including Asmodeus, the Resistance, and the

307
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:04,770
Miracle Man. The Miracle Man stole Damon's dark
soul, trapping it in a serpent. Deprived of his

308
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:10,110
demonic half, Damon lost much of his power but was
freed from his infernal corruption. Believing

309
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:15,810
himself cured, he retired his son of Satan
identity. He married Patsy and together they

310
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:19,950
moved to San Francisco operating as paranormal
investigators while Damon taught

311
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:25,410
parapsychology. To shield his reputation as a
scholar, he began using the alias Hellstorm when

312
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:30,470
battling supernatural forces in public. The two
occasionally aided other heroes including the

313
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:35,750
West Coast Avengers and confronted foes such as
Master Pentamonium, the Cat People, and demonic

314
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:41,850
spirits tied to the Phantom Rider. But the absence
of Damon's dark soul left him gravely weakened. In

315
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:47,490
desperation, Patsy summoned Satan through the
Grimorium Barum, a book of dark spells pleading

316
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:53,250
for her husband's life. Satan restored Damon's
dark soul, but Patsy was driven insane at the sight

317
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:58,850
of his full demonic essence. Though Damon
admitted gratitude, he coldly confessed he would

318
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:04,110
have let her die in the same situation. Her mind
shattered. Patsy eventually took her own life

319
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:10,190
under the influence of a being named Death Urge.
Emboldened, Damon reclaimed his role in the

320
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:15,570
occult world, forging alliances with figures
such as Necra, the Gargoyle, Gabriel the Devil

321
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:21,450
Hunter, and his new lover, Janie Cutter. He struck
a bargain with the witch, Lavoison, fathering her

322
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:27,070
child in exchange for knowledge of his father's
true name. Armed with this secret, Damon slew

323
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:35,050
Satan, aka Marduk Curios, inheriting his black
halo and lordship of his hell realm. He proclaimed

324
00:30:35,050 --> 00:30:40,030
his rule as a balance between heaven and hell,
ensuring neither could dominate humanity's

325
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:45,170
destiny. From this position, Damon grew ever more
manipulative. He participated in conflicts

326
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:50,650
involving Celine and Blackheart's demonic
Hellfire Club, a select group of mutants and

327
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:56,130
demons attempting to exert control over society.
Damon took a seat in its inner circle as the White

328
00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:01,150
King, claiming to balance good and evil. He
deceived the Thunderbolts into rescuing Patsy's

329
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:05,950
soul from Mephisto's realm, enabling her
resurrection. At times he spread deliberate

330
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:11,370
falsehoods about his lineage, claiming even to be
the son of another hell lord named Satanish, a ploy

331
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:17,450
to distance Patsy from him and protect her from the
horrors of his life as a hell lord. Using such lies,

332
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:22,730
he briefly assumed control of Satanish's hell
realm and Dormammu's claim to rule through the

333
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:28,150
flames of Faltine, though Mephisto soon seized
most of the territory. You can learn more about

334
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:33,730
Dormammu and Mephisto in their respective duels
against Trigon and Santman. Damon remained

335
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:39,130
embroiled in battles among hell lords. When
Dormammu attempted to annex Hell, Damon allied

336
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:45,330
with Mephisto, Hela, Pluto, and Patsy to repel the
invasion. He later confronted angelic forces

337
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:51,190
during the Angel's Zadkill's Takeover of Heaven,
hunting a boy prophesied as the Antichrist, named

338
00:31:51,190 --> 00:31:57,610
Anton Satan. Damon, Janie Cutter, Ghostrider,
and others pursued Anton, though Damon argued for

339
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:03,090
killing him outright, only relenting when
pressed to prioritize defeating Zadkill. He

340
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:08,250
later became involved in the contest for Sorcerer
Supreme after Doctor Strange stepped down,

341
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:13,570
though Brother Budu ultimately inherited the
mantle. After a demonic invasion of Las Vegas,

342
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:19,270
Damon discovered that a prophecy called the
Descent was real. A day when a hell lord would gain

343
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,810
greater power, those they had marked would
transform into demons, and their heirs would

344
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:28,990
ascend from hell. Damon betrayed the Avengers and
allied with the Red Skull's daughter, Sin, in a

345
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:34,450
plan to raise the world. He later fell victim to
revenge by Brother Budu's brother, a spirit named

346
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:40,750
Daniel Drum, who killed Damon, though his spirit
endured. Revived, Damon joined Baron Zemo's

347
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:46,370
Masters of Evil and fought in a war of gods in a
desperate stand against the Shinto God of Evil, to

348
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:51,890
whom Hell had fallen. Later, Damon accepted a
teaching role as Strange Academy in New Orleans,

349
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:56,830
instructing students in infernal magic
alongside the mutant, Magic, whom you can learn

350
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:01,970
more about in her duel against Deadman. And that's
Hellstorm's backstory. Powers-wise, Damon is

351
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:08,390
the son of the Hell Lord, Marduk Kirios, aka Satan.
His demonic soul grants him enhanced physiology

352
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:14,650
with enhanced strength, able to lift over one ton,
and bulletproof durability. He can generate and

353
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:19,850
manipulate Soulfire, a version of Hellfire that
can hurt demons, which he can also form into

354
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:25,610
constructs such as shields or restraints. He can
also use the Soulfire to fly or burn holes through

355
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:30,610
reality to create teleportation portals.
Hellstorm can use magic to project a psychic

356
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:37,390
astral form and read the thoughts of others. He has
spells for healing, hypnotizing, scrying,

357
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:43,810
exercising, shapeshifting and more, as well as
mystic senses. He wields a Nethraenium Trident,

358
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:48,770
through which he can channel his powers and use as a
weapon. He is a skilled supernatural detective

359
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:55,170
with advanced knowledge of theology, the occult,
and the supernatural. And that is Hellstorm. I

360
00:33:55,170 --> 00:34:01,890
can't believe that Marvel is dumb enough to use the
name like Son of Satan as the name of a superhero.

361
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:06,930
Like, who's going to be calling for him to save
them? Oh, save me, Son of Satan! Yeah, actually,

362
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:12,290
the original name of that comic book was Mark of
Satan, before Marvel decided to change it. It was

363
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:17,889
supposed to be along the same lines of the Tomb of
Dracula comic book series. I don't know why Son of

364
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:23,130
Satan is a better title than Mark of Satan, but
yeah, if I had a choice of heroes to save me, it

365
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:27,469
wouldn't be him, largely because he's a selfish
son of a bitch. And that's probably why he grew more

366
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:32,090
villainous over time. Oh, that all of a sudden they
have him teaching a strange academy as if he wasn't

367
00:34:32,090 --> 00:35:15,230
a villain. It's all very strange. Academy. And
that's it for this video. I hope you enjoyed it.

368
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:32,510
I'll see you in the next one. Well, now that we've
got their histories and abilities out of the way,

369
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:37,830
let's speculate on how one of the 1000 simulated
matches will go. The winner is determined by

370
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:44,210
simulations, not the speculation, but it's fun to
imagine how the fight could play out. AJ9K, what

371
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:49,810
are the rules of our speculation? Well, I should
say there are no rules other than the characters

372
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:55,050
have no prior knowledge of the other going into the
fight. All they are aware of starting out is that

373
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:59,530
the other character is a threat that needs to be
eliminated. For the speculation, the

374
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:04,750
contestants will begin approximately 50 meters
apart in a nondescript environment that will have

375
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:09,130
no bearing on the match itself, as no
environmental statistics are considered in my

376
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:14,250
simulations. The contestants must earn victory
on their own merit. All right, then let's get into

377
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:19,210
it. Ocean Master and Hellstorm meet on the
battlefield. Who goes first? I'm going to say

378
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:25,470
Ocean Master starts off by raising his trident and
summoning a giant ass tidal wave straight from

379
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:31,830
your nightmares, which rushes in from behind
Ocean Master and crashes right on top of

380
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:37,910
Hellstorm, just drowning his ass. No, because
Hellstorm would see the water coming at him. And as

381
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:42,590
the wave approaches, he just slams his trident
into the ground and parts that water like the Red

382
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:49,010
Sea, creating like this like wedge of heat that
like separates the waves. And so like there's this

383
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:54,630
lane of dryness between the part of waters. And
through that, Hellstorm shoots out this like

384
00:36:54,630 --> 00:37:01,230
massive soulfire blast in the shape of a pentagram
at Ocean Master. And it just hits him and Ocean

385
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:06,990
Master gets burned alive. No, because as that's
coming at Ocean Master, he's just going to dive

386
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:14,710
into one of the walls of water to his side and use
that to swim towards Hellstorm. And he's going to

387
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:21,030
manipulate the body of water he's in to swirl
around Hellstorm, trapping him in this massive

388
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:28,110
whirlpool and allowing Ocean Master to just swim
around him and stab him a bunch of times. Hellstorm

389
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:34,390
could fly though. So no, he's not getting pulled
into the water. He actually hovers above it. And

390
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:40,150
then he dips his trident into the water, which sets
everything to an instant boil. So all the water

391
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:47,630
evaporates and all that's left is just Ocean
Master, who's freshly cooked. I mean, that's a lot

392
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:54,830
of water to boil. So let's say Ocean Master, he's
steamed, not boiled, but he'll cool off because

393
00:37:54,830 --> 00:38:00,690
he's going to summon a rainstorm that's just going
to drench the environment once again. And it's

394
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:06,850
going to pummel Hellstorm with hail stones the
size of literal cats and dogs. Dogs like

395
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:13,530
Chihuahuas, you mean? Sipernards, bitch. Who
cares? Either way, Hellstorm is going to create a

396
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:19,070
like spherical fire shield around him. And hail is
not going to get through that because Pokemon

397
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:27,370
rules fire beats ice. And within his fire shield,
Hellstorm's eyes burn and he casts a hypnotizing

398
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:32,790
spell to take over Ocean Master's mind. And now
Ocean Master's eyes burn because he's under

399
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:39,890
Hellstorm's control. I Ocean Master literally
wears a mask that covers his eyes. I don't think

400
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:45,170
that spell is going to work on him. In fact, Marvel
probably has some dumb rule against that. Like,

401
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:49,950
you know how you can't be mind controlled if you
wear a helmet? No, I mean, like this is more demon

402
00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:57,410
possession than psychic mind control. It's more
like exorcist than Professor X. Right. So Ocean

403
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:04,670
Master gets mind controlled and his eyes burned
through his mask. OK, but Ocean Master is Homo Magi

404
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:11,510
Atlantean royalty. So he's going to be able to
realize that Hellstorm is trying to possess him.

405
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:17,410
So he's going to cast his own Atlantean spell
that's going to stop what Hellstorm is doing and

406
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:24,230
flood Hellstorm's mind with negative thoughts of
all the crap he's done, like betray his wife and the

407
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:29,790
Avengers and, you know, just general evil doing.
And this is going to put him in mental anguish and

408
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:33,810
cause him to be like, oh, no, I suck. And he's going
to drop his shield and his Trident and he's going to

409
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:39,950
fall to the ground. I mean, like that may have
stopped Hellstorm's possession spell, but he's

410
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:44,890
not going to feel that bad. He's one of the Lords of
Hell, right? So like after he falls to the ground,

411
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:50,590
he's just going to get right back up, like unfazed,
and he points his Trident at Ocean Master and

412
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:56,490
manifests these fire rings around him, binding
him in fire. And then he telekinetically pulls

413
00:39:56,490 --> 00:40:02,730
Ocean Master toward him right onto his Trident and
paling him like a shish kabob. OK, well, as Ocean

414
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:08,050
Master is being pulled toward Hellstorm, he's
going to cast a teleportation spell. Actually,

415
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:14,050
he's going to cast an illusion spell at the same
time. So Hellstorm thinks he's impaled Ocean

416
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:20,530
Master when in reality, Ocean Master is now behind
Hellstorm and he's going to impale him instead

417
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:27,730
with his electrified Trident that's going to
overload and kill Hellstorm. Match over. But like

418
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:33,610
the moment this illusion Ocean Master gets
impaled, Hellstorm's Trident is going to burn the

419
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:39,590
illusion away. So Hellstorm realizes the
deception with enough time to spin around and

420
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:46,150
block Ocean Master's electric Trident attack. He
just smacks his Trident away. And then Hellstorm

421
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:53,370
summons a Hellfire portal that sends them both to
hell, where Ocean Master just burns an agony,

422
00:40:53,370 --> 00:41:00,330
instantly desiccates into this like skeleton of
Ash and Embers. And that is where the match ends in

423
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:07,030
hell. Yep. I mean, Ocean Master, he's just going to
conjure these massive geysers that are going to

424
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:12,470
flood the entire realm, drowning everyone, all
the demons in Hellstorm. So yeah, he's fine. He

425
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:17,150
just has a new realm to roll over, I guess. That's
the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my entire

426
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:23,110
life. But you can't flood Hell. It's too hot. All
the water would just evaporate. It's not like it's

427
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:29,490
magic water. It has a boiling point. It is
literally magic water. What? No, it's water

428
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:35,930
summoned through magic. It's not magic water that
makes it magic. OK, OK. Well, we'll go ahead and

429
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:41,010
leave the match there. One of two scenarios
happens. Either Ocean Master burns alive in hell

430
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:48,390
or he floods hell and drowns Hellstorm, which of
those sound even remotely possible. It was holy

431
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:54,670
water. Now what do you say? Hey, you may have me
there, but let's go ahead and put the stats, run the

432
00:41:54,670 --> 00:42:01,490
simulations and come back with a winner. A.G .9K,
hit it. Inputting data, running calculations,

433
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:07,850
processing results, simulations complete. This
is a damn good matchup, man. Damn good matchup.

434
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:13,370
Both of these guys are insanely powerful. They can
both do teleportation. They can both do magic.

435
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:18,130
They both have elemental magical powers with
their tridents. They're both highly versatile,

436
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:23,150
although Hellstorm comes out a little bit ahead
there just because he has a lot more psychic feats

437
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:28,990
than Ocean Master, which is also why Hellstorm has
the advantage in perception. Right. Hellstorm

438
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:36,230
also had the advantage in invasiveness, but Ocean
Master had the edge in durability and strength

439
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:41,930
thanks to his Atlantean physiology, which is
apparently stronger than demonic physiology,

440
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:47,630
because Hellstorm is only credited with lifting
about a ton, whereas Ocean Master can lift about as

441
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:55,110
much as Aquaman. The range on Ocean Master and the
damage level is off the charts. His feet of

442
00:42:55,110 --> 00:43:00,850
destroying entire cities thanks to his mask crown
and the bodies of water he's able to control with

443
00:43:00,850 --> 00:43:07,370
that is just freaking brutal. I mean, I've seen
Hellstorm blow up a few buildings with Hellfire,

444
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:12,570
but I don't think I've ever seen him level entire
cities simultaneously. So Ocean Master got the

445
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:18,010
edge and damage level and I guess fighting skill
because Ocean Master is more formally trained

446
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:24,750
than Hellstorm. Right. He was like a master of
Atlantean combat at age eight. So taking all of

447
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:30,050
these stats into account, Joseph, who do you think
is coming out on top in this match? To quote an X-Win

448
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:34,530
movie, why do you ask questions to which you
already know the answer? Because I want to make

449
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:40,910
sure that you're thinking the same thing I am. Oh, I
am Hellstorm. That's not what I was thinking.

450
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:45,490
Well, it's what most of our Instagram followers
are thinking, because 56% of them are siding with

451
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:51,330
Hellstorm in this fight. Well, let's see if
they're right. AJ9K, the results, please. Hey,

452
00:43:51,330 --> 00:44:00,070
you are, sir. All right, the winner of the matchup
between DC's Ocean Master and Marvel's Hellstorm

453
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:08,710
is Ocean Master. No, but it's the reverse of what
Instagram thought. Ocean Master actually won

454
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:20,110
56.1% or 561 of the 1000 simulated matches. And
Hellstorm won 43.9% of the matches. What is

455
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:26,930
happening? How is Ocean Master able to be a Lord of
Hell? Doesn't register with me. The fuck is going

456
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:35,950
on? Well, it's Ocean Master's physiology and just
sheer raw power. Hellstorm may be more versatile,

457
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:40,790
but it's not enough to overpower Ocean Master,
apparently. What the fuck is the tidal wave going

458
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:47,150
to do to Hellstorm? Defeat him, apparently. I
don't see that happening. I don't see any way that

459
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:53,850
Hellstorm could be Ocean Master. So easily just
burn him alive. And what is fire going to do against

460
00:44:53,850 --> 00:45:00,270
water? Evaporate it. OK, so then it turns into a
cloud, which becomes rain, which then rains on the

461
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:07,530
fire, dousing the fire. Pokemon rolls. Water
beats fire, my guy. Stupid, not soul fire, not

462
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:18,450
magic water. Hey, dude, it's OK. The son of Satan
lost. Things are going to be fine. Did you want him

463
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:26,030
to win? Yeah, that's evil, bro. He's a good guy,
even when he's not a good guy with the worst name

464
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:31,290
that a good guy could ever have. No, Hellstorm is a
badass name. I don't care what you say. I was

465
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:36,190
talking about his son of Satan name. I can't get
over how dumb that is. I'm talking about

466
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:43,570
Hellstorm. Even that, even that. Oh, save me,
Hellstorm. No, save me, Ocean Master. I want you to

467
00:45:43,570 --> 00:45:50,150
save me. Yeah, Master of the Oceans, especially if
you're in the ocean when you need saving. This is

468
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:58,410
dumb. I'm I'm so ready for it to be January already.
You piece of shit. Adrian and Kay, help close this

469
00:45:58,410 --> 00:46:35,990
out. In our next matchup, we are doing another
Halloween spooky-esque duel, this time with two

470
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:41,830
villainous sorcerers, Felix Faust versus Baron
Mordo. Yeah, that episode has been a long time

471
00:46:41,830 --> 00:46:46,110
coming. Can't wait for that one, when Marvel's
finally going to get their comeuppance. You have

472
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:50,170
yet to learn. You will, though. That is it for this
episode. We want to give a big thanks to our
