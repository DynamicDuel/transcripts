This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,346 --> 00:00:28,889
Welcome to the dynamic duel podcast a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:34,374
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters And stat based battle simulations.

4
00:00:34,954 --> 00:00:40,859
I'm Marvelous Joe and I'm his twin brother Johnny
DC And in this episode we are going to put

5
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:48,125
the debate to rest on who would win in a fight
between Geoforce and Quake a match that literally

6
00:00:48,545 --> 00:00:55,138
a few people asked for Because Geoforce is not
very well known I think As opposed to Quake?

7
00:00:55,518 --> 00:00:58,980
Like what if she did some like ragtag shield
agent who doesn't even have like a superhero

8
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:03,642
costume? No, I mean she was the lead character
and agents of shield besides, you know, Phil

9
00:01:03,682 --> 00:01:07,643
Coulson. So I don't know what you're talking
about Quake is taking this one. You have no

10
00:01:07,743 --> 00:01:12,665
idea how hard she's gonna lose. You'll find
out. You're gonna learn today We'll see before

11
00:01:12,685 --> 00:01:15,947
we get into that matchup before we put in the
character stats and run a thousand simulations

12
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:19,568
and find out who would definitively win We're
gonna break down the latest comic book movie

13
00:01:19,588 --> 00:01:23,490

38
00:03:32,677 --> 00:03:39,420
to the no prize! No Prize is an award Marvel
used to give out to fans. Our version, the

39
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:44,322
Dynamic Duel No Prize, is a digital award we
post on Instagram for the person that we feel

40
00:03:44,362 --> 00:03:49,905
gave the best answer to our question of the
week. Last week we asked, what Marvel or DC

41
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:55,688
character do you think has had the most successful
trilogy of films and why? And of course this

42
00:03:55,728 --> 00:04:01,432
tied into the trailer for the third Venom film,
Venom The Last Dance. Yeah, little round out

43
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:04,753
that character's trilogy and we were curious
who you guys thought had the best trilogy.

44
00:04:05,142 --> 00:04:09,564
So let's run down our honorable mentions as
well as the no prize winner. Our first honorable

45
00:04:09,584 --> 00:04:16,268
mention goes to Waldo, who said, Hey guys, it's
Waldo again. So as far as the most successful

46
00:04:16,308 --> 00:04:23,351
film trilogy, I'm pretty sure it'd be Nolan's
Batman with Christian Bale. So while I may

47
00:04:23,391 --> 00:04:30,515
not like it, he was Batman in name only, he
did very little detective work. And all his

48
00:04:30,555 --> 00:04:38,523
stuff was made by Fox, and she showed very little
actual intellect of His fans are still raving

49
00:04:38,543 --> 00:04:45,168
about it to this day. I hear you man, I am not
a fan of the Dark Knight trilogy being a Marvel

50
00:04:45,188 --> 00:04:50,691
fan myself. Like that Batman was not the Batman
that I know. My gosh. He wasn't that smart.

51
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:56,754
He didn't make anything. He didn't deduce anything.
He was basically a piece of shit. But for some

52
00:04:56,814 --> 00:05:01,216
reason- I'm gonna slap the shit out of you.
People really like the Dark Knight trilogy.

53
00:05:01,276 --> 00:05:05,959
I don't know why. Jonathan, can you explain
it? The films are amazing first of all. I don't

54
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:12,583
get why you wouldn't like the Dark Knight trilogy.
It's such a great saga. of Batman from beginning

55
00:05:12,623 --> 00:05:17,586
to end. You know, it starts off perfectly with
Batman Begins, ramps up with the Dark Knight,

56
00:05:18,167 --> 00:05:23,390
and doesn't quite stick the landing with Rises,
but it comes damn close. Making arguments that,

57
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:29,054
oh, it's not good because Batman didn't make
his own gadgets. I actually liked what they

58
00:05:29,094 --> 00:05:34,498
did with this movie because Bruce Wayne is not
an engineer. Like, it's OK if the head engineer

59
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:39,101
from Wayne Tech makes his gadgets for him. That's
not a problem. It's kind of cool, actually.

60
00:05:39,414 --> 00:05:44,977
that he would have a cue of sorts in the same
way James Bond does. And as for detective work,

61
00:05:45,477 --> 00:05:51,120
you guys are smoking so much crack. What are
you talking about? Like he did fantastic detective

62
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:55,862
work like in The Dark Knight with like his sonar
gear and stuff like that and finding answers.

63
00:05:55,922 --> 00:06:02,486
And you guys are so wrong, but yet so right
in that it's a fantastic trilogy. I never said

64
00:06:02,506 --> 00:06:08,149
it was a fantastic trilogy. Waldo did. OK, well,
you're wrong then. And Waldo's right. Great

65
00:06:08,209 --> 00:06:13,949
answer, Waldo. Our next honorable mention goes
to... Miggi Mattingian, who said... Hey what's

66
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:19,252
up guys, this is Miggi, and my favorite superhero
trilogy is the Dark Knight trilogy. Of course,

67
00:06:19,272 --> 00:06:25,016
you know I had to do it as a DC fan, but not
just that, because of that. It's just legitimately

68
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:29,799
a really great trilogy. Batman Begins just kind
of revolutionized the genre, bringing like

69
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:35,443
a grounded, like, serious take on superheroes.
Dark Knight is just a masterpiece inducted

70
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:39,318
into the National Library of Congress. And then
Dark Knight Rises is just like... wraps it

71
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:45,642
up really nicely. So yeah. Thanks guys. Yeah,
the Dark Knight influenced an entire generation

72
00:06:45,943 --> 00:06:50,726
of films and filmmakers. You wouldn't even have
the Iron Man movie if the Dark Knight wasn't

73
00:06:50,746 --> 00:06:57,711
made as influential as it was in terms of taking
a really serious approach to the subject matter.

74
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:03,515
You're aware that Iron Man came out before the
Dark Knight, right? No, I'm fucking not aware

75
00:07:03,555 --> 00:07:11,673
of that, obviously. Well, it did. So I met after
Batman begins, which it was inspired by with

76
00:07:11,693 --> 00:07:23,603
all the flashbacks and nonlinear storytelling.
All right. You're dumb. No, no, you are. Great

77
00:07:23,663 --> 00:07:29,909
answer. Make your next honorable mention goes
to Cyrus Moore, who said, Hey guys, Cyrus Moore

78
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:36,798
here. And we all know, obviously the best movie
trilogy is the X. I mean it's the Christian

79
00:07:36,818 --> 00:07:42,039
Bale Batman movies. You physically can't get
any better. We all know Christian Bale was

80
00:07:42,059 --> 00:07:48,801
the best Batman. Most successful movie is Christian
Bale Batman. It's the movie trilogy we deserve

81
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:53,923
and the one that we need also, cause it's so
damn good. It seems like everybody's answering

82
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:59,424
the Dark Knight trilogy. Yeah, cause it's clearly
the obvious winner. Even though it's not the

83
00:07:59,444 --> 00:08:05,920
winner of the Snow Prize for some effed up reason.
I'll tell you why it's not the No Prize winner.

84
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,203
It's because, you know, if everybody's answering
The Dark Knight Rises, how do we choose among

85
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:14,807
them? Obviously, we have to go with the choice
that is not the Dark Knight trilogy, and therefore,

86
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:22,153
the winner of this week's No Prize goes to Scotty
Macho, who said, Scotty Macho from Max Destruction,

87
00:08:22,914 --> 00:08:27,677
my DC cohorts are not going to like me for this
answer, but they will understand. I'm going

88
00:08:27,697 --> 00:08:35,150
to say Deadpool. Now Deadpool Overring hasn't
come out officially yet. But I mean, when it

89
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:42,492
does, is there any argument? I mean, the Deadpool
series has been phenomenal and only Ryan Reynolds

90
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:49,754
can deliver it. Deadpool is my pick. Is there
any argument? Hell yeah, there's a lot of argument.

91
00:08:49,914 --> 00:08:54,115
The first two Deadpool movies were good, but
none of them even come close to approaching

92
00:08:54,475 --> 00:09:00,437
the quality of The Dark Knight. I would argue
that the first Deadpool movie is funnier than

93
00:09:00,477 --> 00:09:04,690
The Dark Knight and therefore better. So there
you go. I mean, Deadpool 2 is a little bit

94
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:10,853
eh, but I think Scotty has a point, even though
the fact that he is empirically incorrect in

95
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:15,435
his answer because the third Deadpool movie
has not yet come out. But we're gonna give

96
00:09:15,475 --> 00:09:20,717
it to him anyway because he had the originality
to not be a sheeple and say the Dark Knight

97
00:09:20,757 --> 00:09:25,659
trilogy. There's only one answer to this question.
Like it was a bad question to begin with because

98
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:31,501
obviously it's the Dark Knight trilogy. I will
say that we retain the right to retroactively

99
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:36,669
strip Scotty of this no prize if in fact it
turns out that the Deadpool and Wolverine movie

100
00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:41,094
sucks, but I don't think it's going to so I
think this no prize is gonna stick. I mean

101
00:09:41,134 --> 00:09:47,199
even if it doesn't it's still not gonna match
the influence and magnum opus That is the Nolan

102
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:52,084
trilogy of Batman films. What if Deadpool and
Wolverine is so good that it wins like Best

103
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:57,989
Picture Oscar You don't know how good it's gonna
be shut the hell up Check your expectations

104
00:09:58,582 --> 00:10:02,584
Jonathan, what would you answer to this question?
What do you think is the best superhero trilogy?

105
00:10:02,864 --> 00:10:08,327
The Dark Knight trilogy, obviously, hands down.
Okay, you're also a sheeple then, okay. What

106
00:10:08,347 --> 00:10:13,010
would you say? I mean, there's a lot of Marvel
answers that you could give. I thought Spider-Man,

107
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:17,512
the Tom Holland Spider-Man trilogy, like the
Home trilogy was incredible. I think it was

108
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:22,355
even better than the Sam Raimi trilogy, but
also Guardians of the Galaxy. I think all three

109
00:10:22,395 --> 00:10:27,914
of those films, Guardians, Volume One, Two,
and Three, were incredible. and they probably

110
00:10:27,954 --> 00:10:33,378
won't ever be beaten in terms of that franchise.
So I guess my pick would be for Guardians.

111
00:10:33,918 --> 00:10:38,341
I'm actually really surprised you didn't say
Captain America because Winter Soldier and

112
00:10:38,381 --> 00:10:45,185
Civil War are really good. Yeah, they're fantastic.
They're incredible. But I'm not sure the first

113
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:49,828
movie compares to the latter two. The thing
is, though, you know why people didn't call

114
00:10:49,888 --> 00:10:54,879
in with those answers? Because they were lazy.
Because those still aren't as good as the Dark

115
00:10:54,899 --> 00:11:00,324
Knight trilogy and everyone knows it. I don't
know that. Cause you're stupid. Great answer

116
00:11:00,364 --> 00:11:04,447
Scotty, you win this week's no prize. If you
the listener want to win your own no prize,

117
00:11:04,608 --> 00:11:08,851
stay tuned to later on this episode when we'll
be asking another question of the week. And

118
00:11:08,891 --> 00:11:11,033
now that that's done, on to the news!

119
00:11:16,566 --> 00:11:20,769
Alright, this past week we got horrible news
in regards to the Blade movie that is currently

120
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:26,354
being produced by Marvel Studios. This project
has been languishing in development hell for

121
00:11:26,434 --> 00:11:32,579
quite a while now, ever since it was first announced
by Kevin Feige at the 2019 Comic Con, where

122
00:11:32,599 --> 00:11:38,924
we first saw the upcoming star of Blade, Mahershala
Ali, put on the Blade hat. Ever since that

123
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:43,908
announcement, I've been waiting with bated breath
for the Blade movie to come out, and it's been

124
00:11:43,968 --> 00:11:50,185
delayed after... director loss after delay,
after new writer, after director loss, and

125
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:55,969
there's just no end to this bad news. But we
learned that the director that was most recently

126
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:03,315
attached, Jan Damange, is no longer directing
Marvel Studios' Blade. And it's almost like

127
00:12:03,335 --> 00:12:07,919
the movie is cursed by this point, because it's
already 2024. It seems like the movie is not

128
00:12:07,939 --> 00:12:12,502
going to come out for quite a while now that
they have to. you know, essentially look for

129
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:16,544
a new director. And at that point you might
get new script rewrites to suit the new director

130
00:12:16,564 --> 00:12:21,165
and stuff like that. Hopefully Mahershala Ali
stays with the project because I do think that

131
00:12:21,206 --> 00:12:25,867
he'd be a fantastic Blade. But at this point,
everything just seems up in the air in regards

132
00:12:25,927 --> 00:12:29,869
to this particular franchise. Would you hate
it if they just scrapped the whole project?

133
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:36,792
Yeah, obviously. I mean, we already have quite
a few good Blade movies. I'm not quite sure

134
00:12:36,892 --> 00:12:42,138
what they could do with it that has already
been done successfully. in the prior franchise

135
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:48,400
with Wesley Snipes. We have two good Blade movies
and I mean we've seen what Marvel Studios is

136
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:53,221
capable of doing with characters that are under
their purview as compared to other studios.

137
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:58,043
Like say the Hulk. I thought Incredible Hulk
was better than 2003's Hulk. I think Blade

138
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:04,084
has the potential to not only be an amazing
franchise but also steer the MCU in a direction

139
00:13:04,104 --> 00:13:09,594
that it's really never gone down before. Except
for you know. the werewolf by night special

140
00:13:09,634 --> 00:13:13,356
presentation that they released on Disney plus
a few years ago Honestly, they should have

141
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:16,997
just introduced blade in that short film It
would have been a much better introduction

142
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:22,499
than what he got in eternals If I was Kevin
Feige, I would scrap eternals just scrub that

143
00:13:22,699 --> 00:13:27,181
erase it from everyone's memory And scrap this
blade film as well because we don't need it.

144
00:13:27,201 --> 00:13:32,563
Uh, we do need it and I don't know what you're
talking about. We don't need vampires in the

145
00:13:32,684 --> 00:13:38,286
mcu. It's just gonna like make things so complicated
How are vampires complicated? How are they

146
00:13:38,306 --> 00:13:43,350
not complicated? What? They're very complicated.
No, they're not, they're fine. It's all fine.

147
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:47,473
People already know the lore of vampires, so
introducing a vampire hunter into the mix,

148
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:52,997
I think, would not only be cool, it would be
unique, at least for the MCU. Now, Yann Dimage

149
00:13:53,137 --> 00:13:58,661
replaced Bassam Tariq as the director, and now
I'm wondering who's gonna replace Yann Dimage.

150
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:03,084
I think there are quite a few candidates that
I think would make a great Blade movie, and

151
00:14:03,104 --> 00:14:04,885
that brings us to our question of the week.

no prize that we'll post to Instagram. Be sure

157
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:41,848
to answer before June 22nd. In DC news, last
week we got the teaser trailer for parts 1

158
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:48,852
and 2 of an animated watchman film that is going
to be released direct to video and it looks

159
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:55,316
incredible. Honestly, it looks a lot like the
Zack Snyder film, which also looked incredible.

160
00:14:55,756 --> 00:15:00,098
And I think that was the most surprising thing
to me in this trailer. It was just a reminder

161
00:15:00,138 --> 00:15:06,578
of how faithful Zack Snyder's framing was in
matching the panels from the comic. Now this

162
00:15:06,618 --> 00:15:13,181
project was first announced in 2017 and we didn't
hear anything about it until 2023 at Comic

163
00:15:13,201 --> 00:15:19,343
Con and yeah I totally forgot it existed until
this was released and now I'm pretty pumped

164
00:15:19,383 --> 00:15:24,085
for it. It's coming out fairly soon the first
part is supposed to be released in August of

165
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:29,588
this year but part two won't be coming out until
next year I guess. My big question is why is

166
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:36,043
this a thing? Like why is this necessary if
it's so close? to the Zack Snyder live action

167
00:15:36,243 --> 00:15:42,168
Watchmen adaptation, do we need this animated
project? We do not, I believe. I think the

168
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:47,272
reason they're doing it is because it's been
over 10 years since Zack Snyder's film, and

169
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:52,437
Warner Brothers just likes to keep Watchmen
out in people's consciousness, as it were.

170
00:15:52,837 --> 00:15:57,801
I mean, we recently had the Watchmen HBO television
series, though, that did a great job of doing

171
00:15:57,862 --> 00:16:02,405
just that. This Watchmen movie that's coming
out looks almost exactly like the What If.

172
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:07,241
style of animation that we've seen from Disney
Plus. This whole trailer just made me think

173
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:13,967
like, what if DC were to make a redundant Watchmen
movie? That's what this trailer is asking.

174
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:19,351
Oh yeah? The style of this actually matches
the style that was done with the Super Sons

175
00:16:19,391 --> 00:16:26,357
movie, if you remember that. So no, they're
not biting off of the what if style of animation

176
00:16:26,397 --> 00:16:31,970
that Disney Plus is doing with that show. So
calm down, okay? I don't know about that. The

177
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:37,215
teaser trailer was not that long, it's only
41 seconds. But yeah, every frame is basically

178
00:16:37,275 --> 00:16:43,080
like a panel from the comic. So you can make
the argument that this is unnecessary, since

179
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:50,687
not only do we have a movie and a comic, but
Watchmen is just such a good story. I'm pretty

180
00:16:50,727 --> 00:16:56,933
much down with any adaptation. We did receive
an animated Watchmen motion comic over a decade

181
00:16:56,973 --> 00:17:03,163
ago. and I still loved watching that even with
the live action movie having been made and

182
00:17:03,243 --> 00:17:08,384
I'll probably still enjoy this adaptation as
well. I'm gonna tell you now and I'm speaking

183
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:13,446
on behalf of everybody else besides you. No
one gives a shit about this. No one cares if

184
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:16,947
they want to experience the Watchmen story.
They're gonna read the graphic novel or they're

185
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:20,328
gonna go watch Zack Snyder's version and if
they want more than that they're gonna go watch

186
00:17:20,348 --> 00:17:25,669
the HBO television series. No one gives a shit
about this. Except for people who haven't read

187
00:17:25,729 --> 00:17:31,143
the graphic novel. who maybe haven't seen the
Zack Snyder film and maybe want more information

188
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:38,405
behind the story that was the HBO Watchmen sequel
series. So like two people. Burn. What? I'm

189
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:43,046
sure it's more than two. You know what? And
you also forget people like me who just legitimately

190
00:17:43,186 --> 00:17:47,427
like Watchmen and are totally down to watch
this. I think people just need to get over

191
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:52,768
Watchmen already. Like it was a thing. It was
fine when it came out. It was fantastic even,

192
00:17:53,169 --> 00:17:58,803
but you know what? It's been adapted so many
times now. Who cares? Who cares? Oh wow, someone

193
00:17:58,863 --> 00:18:06,510
sounds butthurt from a teaser trailer. What?
Wow. It's just not necessary. It's just not

194
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:11,494
necessary and I'm sick of Watchmen and people
just need to move on. Well, you know, we are

195
00:18:11,514 --> 00:18:16,679
going to review it. So I'm sorry. I'll get you
a hemorrhoid pillow for when you do it. Cause

196
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:20,782
from all the butthurt that I'm sure will come
out of the review, I will be looking forward

197
00:18:20,822 --> 00:18:26,542
to it. I'll get you some cream too. All right,
cool it. If you haven't seen the trailer, I

198
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:30,845
definitely recommend checking it out again.
It's not long, looks really cool. And I'm curious

199
00:18:30,865 --> 00:18:35,409
to hear what you guys have to say about it.
Tell Joseph how wrong he is. You're not going

200
00:18:35,429 --> 00:18:38,571
to get any feedback about what people think
about this because they're not going to care

201
00:18:38,591 --> 00:18:41,993
enough to answer. It's fine. I can't wait till
I get feedback. I'm going to screenshot it.

202
00:18:42,013 --> 00:18:45,716
I'm going to text it to you. You're not going
to get feedback from anyone outside of discord.

203
00:18:45,756 --> 00:18:52,500
I'll say that. McGee is going to be the only
one that messages you. Well, me and him will

204
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,061
enjoy the movie then. All right.

205
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,464
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and move into

206
00:19:04,504 --> 00:19:10,436
our main event where we find out who had went
in a fight between the Outsiders member Geoforce

207
00:19:10,877 --> 00:19:12,841
and the Agent to Shield, Quake.

208
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:33,332
Alright, GeoForce vs Quake. This episode is
in lead up to our upcoming team duel which

209
00:19:33,392 --> 00:19:39,014
pits the outsiders against X-Force. Now, a lot
of the outsiders are kind of, I feel like,

210
00:19:39,314 --> 00:19:44,136
isolated within the DC universe, but they have
played a prominent role within that team itself,

211
00:19:44,496 --> 00:19:49,718
GeoForce being one of them. Yeah, GeoForce is
a major member of the outsiders. I would say

212
00:19:49,738 --> 00:19:54,700
he's probably the third most important after
Batman and Black Lightning. He's actually led

213
00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:01,335
the team on occasion. Has Quake led SHIELD?
Yeah, she has in fact. She's been the director

214
00:20:01,355 --> 00:20:06,338
of shield so you thought you had something going
there Well, has she been the queen of a country?

215
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:11,001
Geoforce has been the queen of a country. He
has been the king Wow I'm really interested

216
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:15,403
in learning about this obviously both of these
characters have the ability to generate seismic

217
00:20:15,463 --> 00:20:21,027
waves Geoforce can control rocks and quake can
just kick all kinds of ass. If you guys have

218
00:20:21,047 --> 00:20:25,451
watched the Agents of SHIELD television show
that was out a few years ago, you obviously

219
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:30,055
know Quake. She was the main character of that
series next to Agent Phil Coulson, and she

220
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:34,999
was played by Chloe Bennett, and she was a fantastic
character. She has really cool powers as well.

221
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:40,964
And if you guys watched the Young Justice series,
you'll know about GeoForce. All two dozen of

222
00:20:40,984 --> 00:20:45,027
you. Yeah, that's two dozen more than watched
Agents of SHIELD. That's probably not true.

223
00:20:45,047 --> 00:20:49,915
Excuse you, Agents of SHIELD was a popular show.
And it was a fantastic show too, for the most

224
00:20:49,955 --> 00:20:55,820
part, before season 5. It was good. I feel like
you're trying to convince me. I don't need

225
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,605
you to be convinced, I just need you to be sorry
when you lose this match. And I expect you

226
00:21:01,645 --> 00:21:09,191
to die. No. I don't know. But to explain the
methodology behind our duels, let's go with

227
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:15,376
our sentient duel simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000.
AJ9K, tell our listeners how you go about determining

228
00:21:15,436 --> 00:21:20,228
a winner in our duel matchups. Yes, of course,
sir. The way I determine a winner between the

229
00:21:20,268 --> 00:21:25,152
contestants is by running 1,000 Monte Carlo
simulations using the characters' statistics.

230
00:21:25,633 --> 00:21:30,057
A Monte Carlo simulation is a probabilistic
model used to determine outcomes through random

231
00:21:30,117 --> 00:21:35,962
sampling. In this case, I randomize the statistics
along a normal distribution as a way to simulate

232
00:21:35,982 --> 00:21:40,586
the many variables that can occur during battle.
The stat parameters are based on the official

233
00:21:40,626 --> 00:21:45,922
Marvel power grid from which the DC characters'
statistics are extrapolated. Additional stat

234
00:21:45,962 --> 00:21:51,483
categories are included such as range, damage
potential, versatility and perception in order

235
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:56,945
to create a more detailed and accurate simulation.
The results of the 1000 simulations provide

236
00:21:56,965 --> 00:22:01,326
a percentage of wins for each character. The
contestant with the higher percentage is declared

237
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:06,647
the victor as they have a higher probability
to win any given battle. In an equitable pairing,

238
00:22:07,028 --> 00:22:11,829
neither character should win 100% of the matches.
The comic book stories have shown that there's

239
00:22:11,969 --> 00:22:16,763
even a way for Batman to defeat Superman. So
the confidence rate of my method falls in line

240
00:22:16,783 --> 00:22:21,385
with the precedents that have been established
in the source material. My mathematical simulations

241
00:22:21,425 --> 00:22:26,587
are without subjectivity or bias. Feats are
not the sole consideration, nor are fan votes

242
00:22:26,627 --> 00:22:32,590
tabulated for determination of the winner. Thanks
AJ9K! Before we run the simulations though,

243
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:37,212
we like to break down each character's histories
and abilities before improvising a scenario

244
00:22:37,412 --> 00:22:42,254
on how we imagine one of the 1000 simulations
would play out beat for beat. And I believe

245
00:22:42,314 --> 00:22:47,418
it's my turn to go first with the DC characters'
backstory, so let me tell you about Geoforce.

246
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:54,003
Now within the DC Comics universe nestled between
Luxembourg, Belgium, and France, exists the

247
00:22:54,084 --> 00:23:00,208
small fictional country of Markovia, ruled by
a monarchy until it was overthrown by the Nazis

248
00:23:00,249 --> 00:23:06,193
during World War II. When the Nazis were defeated,
their occupation of Markovia ended, and the

249
00:23:06,253 --> 00:23:12,102
monarchy was restored, with its rightful king,
Victor Markov, returned to the throne. King

250
00:23:12,202 --> 00:23:19,567
Markov ruled over Markovia and eventually sired
two sons, Gregor and Brian, and an illegitimate

251
00:23:19,587 --> 00:23:25,030
daughter named Terra, who was raised in America
to spare the throne any embarrassment. You

252
00:23:25,051 --> 00:23:31,415
can learn more about Terra in our Terra vs Avalanche
duel episode. In a land consisting primarily

253
00:23:31,455 --> 00:23:37,939
of farmers and miners, Markovia had no superpowered
champion to call their own, and in an effort

254
00:23:37,959 --> 00:23:43,239
to protect the country against any superpowered
threats, as well as bolster the power of the

255
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:50,125
royal family, Markovia's chief royal scientist,
Dr. Helga Jace, began genetic research to find

256
00:23:50,265 --> 00:23:56,790
and trigger a potential metagene within the
Markovs. After a successful experiment on Terra,

257
00:23:57,110 --> 00:24:02,655
which imbued her with geokinetic metahuman ability,
the illegitimate princess was sent back to

258
00:24:02,715 --> 00:24:07,758
America, where she eventually teamed up with
the villain Deathstroke to infiltrate the Teen

259
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:13,160
Titans, which you can learn more about in our
Titans vs. X-Men Team Duel episode. Meanwhile,

260
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:19,303
the former Nazi Baron Frederick de Lamm, who
was instituted as Markovia's ruler by the Germans

261
00:24:19,403 --> 00:24:25,586
during its World War II occupation, also lived
in exile from Markovia, conspiring to overthrow

262
00:24:25,626 --> 00:24:30,848
its monarchy and return to power, while also
granting him access to a hidden vault within

263
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:37,299
Castle Markov that contained a secret Nazi weapon.
Under the nom de guerre of Baron Bedlam, he

264
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:42,961
hired mercenaries to secretly and successfully
stage a violent revolution within Markovia,

265
00:24:43,361 --> 00:24:48,944
resulting in King Markov being fatally wounded.
Prince Gregor assumed his father's throne,

266
00:24:49,204 --> 00:24:55,026
though he refused to undergo Dr. Helga Jace's
metagenic experiment as he wasn't keen on becoming

267
00:24:55,286 --> 00:24:57,547
a quote-unquote freak like his sister

268
00:25:03,466 --> 00:25:08,989
His brother, Prince Brian, however, believed
in Dr. Jace's research and agreed to undergo

269
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:14,814
her medelline procedure to help protect his
country. A procedure that harnessed the energy

270
00:25:14,874 --> 00:25:20,838
of the planet itself, which Dr. Jace referred
to as the Geo Force. The procedure was nearly

271
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:26,422
interrupted by revolutionaries, however, and
Brian was shot immediately upon its completion.

272
00:25:26,782 --> 00:25:32,094
Quickly buried alive in an unmarked grave to
prevent him from becoming a martyr, Bryan's

273
00:25:32,174 --> 00:25:37,356
new powers drew healing strength from the ground,
and he emerged from his grave only to find

274
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:43,959
that Baron Bedlam had forced Dr. Jace to perform
the Geo Force procedure on him as well, though

275
00:25:43,979 --> 00:25:49,962
she failed to inform him that his powers would
be unstable and temporary as he wasn't of the

276
00:25:50,022 --> 00:25:56,925
royal bloodline of the Markovs. Alongside Batman,
Black Lightning, Metamorpho, Halo, and Kitana,

277
00:25:57,474 --> 00:26:03,457
Prince Bryan was able to repel Baron Bedlam's
invasion of Markovia, with the final duel between

278
00:26:03,517 --> 00:26:09,440
Bryan and Bedlam ending when Bedlam's powers
disappeared just as he was levitating a giant

279
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,923
boulder over his head that he intended to crush
Bryan with. With Baron Bedlam dead and peace

280
00:26:14,963 --> 00:26:20,366
restored to Markovia, Prince Bryan agreed to
join the other heroes in Gotham City to form

281
00:26:20,486 --> 00:26:25,629
a new team known as the Outsiders. Not only
as a way to show his gratitude for their help

282
00:26:25,689 --> 00:26:31,125
in saving his country, but also to train in
the use of his new powers. Although initially

283
00:26:31,265 --> 00:26:37,170
unused to following orders, resulting in frequent
conflicts with the team's leader, Batman, Brian,

284
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:42,574
who took the codename Geoforce to hide his royal
identity, reluctantly learned the value of

285
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:47,539
teamwork. After learning that his half-sister,
Tara, died while betraying the Teen Titans,

286
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:53,604
the heartbroken Brian found comfort in his teammate
Halo's roommate, a woman named Denise Howard,

287
00:26:53,744 --> 00:26:59,028
while he attended Gotham University. While Geoforce
adventured as a member of the Outsiders in

288
00:26:59,068 --> 00:27:07,035
Markovia, Baron Bedlam's corpse was discovered
by an evil geneticist named Dr. Ovarny, aka,

289
00:27:07,716 --> 00:27:14,702
uh, Madame Ovary. After cloning Bedlam and restoring
his memory, Bedlam had her also clone Hitler,

290
00:27:15,102 --> 00:27:20,907
as Bedlam needed his fingerprints to open the
secret vault within Castle Markov. Bedlam orchestrated

291
00:27:21,028 --> 00:27:25,955
another coup on the Markovian monarchy. This
time hiring a supervillain team known as the

292
00:27:25,995 --> 00:27:31,477
Masters of Disasters to aid him, and allying
himself with the Soviet Union, which prevented

293
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:35,599
the United States from getting involved, as
they didn't want to escalate the situation

294
00:27:35,659 --> 00:27:41,541
into a world war. Though Batman tried to prevent
the Outsiders from interfering, the team abandoned

295
00:27:41,581 --> 00:27:46,964
their leader once they learned that King Gregor's
fiance, Princess Elona, had been kidnapped.

296
00:27:47,224 --> 00:27:52,462
Though Brian and the Outsiders were initially
defeated by the Masters of Disaster, and imprisoned

297
00:27:52,602 --> 00:27:58,486
as Baron Bedlam gained access to the Nazi superweapon
of a proton cloud generator, they eventually

298
00:27:58,546 --> 00:28:03,990
escaped and rescued the princess, culminating
in Brian granting Bedlam the opportunity to

299
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:10,234
kill himself, only to be shot in the back instead
and Brian decapitating Bedlam. After separating

300
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:15,598
themselves from Batman, the Outsiders team became
funded by Markovia, and Brian was made the

301
00:28:15,638 --> 00:28:21,854
team leader. Not long after, however, King Gregor
was assassinated. and Brian became the new

302
00:28:21,894 --> 00:28:27,578
king for a time, until it was discovered that
Queen Ilona was pregnant. It was later revealed

303
00:28:27,638 --> 00:28:34,083
that his brother's murderer was none other than
Dr. Helga Jace, who was in fact a sleeper agent

304
00:28:34,143 --> 00:28:38,566
of the Manhunter cult, and she accidentally
killed herself while trying to destroy the

305
00:28:38,666 --> 00:28:44,110
outsiders. The team disbanded shortly after,
and Brian lived with his girlfriend Denise

306
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:50,490
in Markovia for some time, until Brian was framed
for killing Queen Ilona. While on the run with

307
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:56,294
the reformed Outsiders team, Brian managed to
clear his name and bring down Ilona's true

308
00:28:56,334 --> 00:29:02,558
killer, an evil vampire. Eventually, Brian married
Denise and the two served as regents until

309
00:29:02,598 --> 00:29:08,042
his nephew came of age to take the throne as
King of Markovia. After joining the Justice

310
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:14,407
League for a time, Brian left the team to rejoin
the Outsiders, during which time he faced Deathstroke

311
00:29:14,527 --> 00:29:19,494
for what he had done to his sister, Tara, and
the two nearly killed each other. learn more

about Deathstroke in his duel against Deadpool.
In post-Flashpoint continuity, Prince Bryan

313
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:30,724
was the ruler of Markovia, and the origin of
his powers remained largely the same. When

314
00:29:30,744 --> 00:29:35,508
the country of Markovia was destroyed by the
League of Assassins and the Seeker Society

315
00:29:35,548 --> 00:29:41,013
of Super-Villains, Bryan vowed revenge against
both organizations by assassinating Grassal

316
00:29:41,033 --> 00:29:47,634
Ghul and injuring his daughter Talia while disguised
as Deathstroke. His actions resulted in an

317
00:29:47,734 --> 00:29:53,396
underworld shadow war that drew in Batman and
culminated with a showdown between Talia and

318
00:29:53,516 --> 00:29:59,517
Deathstroke, at which point Bryan revealed he
was responsible for everything. Batman's son

319
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:05,139
Damien, who you can learn more about in our
Robin vs. Patriot episode, subsequently defeated

320
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:09,660
Bryan single-handedly, and Bryan was arrested
for killing Ra's al Ghul.

321
00:30:14,902 --> 00:30:20,585
allowing him to generate gravitational fields
that can make objects heavier or lighter, in

322
00:30:20,625 --> 00:30:26,328
effect giving him increased durability and strength.
He also possesses geokinesis, allowing him

323
00:30:26,368 --> 00:30:31,991
to levitate, move, and shape the Earth around
him as well as lava, which he could also shoot

324
00:30:32,011 --> 00:30:39,235
from his hands as beams of molten rock, flames,
or waves of heat. Combining gravity manipulation

325
00:30:39,355 --> 00:30:45,058
with heat propulsion allows Geoforce to fly
at fast speeds. though for short periods of

326
00:30:45,118 --> 00:30:50,463
time, as his powers diminish the longer he's
out of contact with the ground. When underground,

327
00:30:50,743 --> 00:30:57,529
he can heal his wounds and survive without food
or air. Lastly, he is also a skilled hand-to-hand

328
00:30:57,569 --> 00:31:06,336
combatant. That is Geoforce. Madame Ovary, really?
You know, I'm not proud of it. Somebody in

329
00:31:06,396 --> 00:31:11,019
the comic book writing bullpen was just out
of ideas that day. It kind of seems like they

330
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:16,067
wanted to see if they could get away with it,
and they did. And that's a shame. It is a shame.

331
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:20,691
But to help us move past that atrocious writing,
let's go ahead and get into the backstory of

332
00:31:20,972 --> 00:31:27,758
Quake. Now Daisy Johnson was born in New Orleans,
Louisiana to Calvin Zobbo and Kim Johnson.

333
00:31:28,138 --> 00:31:34,103
Her father, Calvin, was an Avengers villain,
also known as Mr. Hyde, who, prior to Daisy's

334
00:31:34,143 --> 00:31:39,007
birth, had developed a serum known as the Hyde
formula that could drastically enhance his

335
00:31:39,088 --> 00:31:43,691
body mass and strength within seconds. though
it came with the side effect of making him

336
00:31:43,731 --> 00:31:50,075
prone to savage anger. In the process of developing
the Hyde formula, Calvin had performed numerous

337
00:31:50,135 --> 00:31:57,140
experiments on himself, inadvertently altering
his own DNA. Daisy's mother, Kim, was an inhuman

338
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:02,544
prostitute who Calvin frequented, and who gave
Daisy up for adoption immediately after her

339
00:32:02,584 --> 00:32:08,408
birth. Daisy was taken in by foster parents
who named her Cory Stutter, and though Daisy

340
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:15,762
showed her troubled nature resulted in her dropping
out of high school to fend for herself. While

341
00:32:15,782 --> 00:32:20,866
committing an act of theft, Daisy's power suddenly
manifested and she discovered she could generate

342
00:32:20,966 --> 00:32:25,911
seismic vibrations when anxious. She was unable
to control these new abilities and was soon

343
00:32:25,951 --> 00:32:30,835
discovered by the International Peacekeeping
and Espionage Organization, known as SHIELD.

344
00:32:31,296 --> 00:32:36,420
Though they initially believed Daisy was a mutant,
SHIELD later discovered that due to her father's

345
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,852
genetic experimentation, Daisy's inhuman powers
were able to manifest without the need for

346
00:32:41,912 --> 00:32:47,456
Terragen, a substance used by the inhuman race
to trigger their latent abilities. You can

347
00:32:47,476 --> 00:32:53,200
learn more about Inhumans and Terragenesis in
our Shazam vs. Black Bolt duel episode. Nick

348
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,503
Fury, the director of SHIELD, took notice of
Daisy's potential and had her train with SHIELD

349
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:03,967
to become an agent. She excelled at the organization
and quickly rose through the ranks, honing

350
00:33:03,987 --> 00:33:08,642
her abilities and completing numerous successful
field missions. often partnered with SHIELD

351
00:33:08,742 --> 00:33:14,385
agent Phil Coulson. Eventually, Daisy went on
to become one of Nick Fury's most trusted operatives,

352
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:19,909
taking on the codename Quake, and getting level
10 security clearance, the only other field

353
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:25,452
agent beside Black Widow to ever do so. Daisy
was tasked with her biggest, most secretive

354
00:33:25,492 --> 00:33:30,495
mission yet when Nick Fury asked her to accompany
heroes such as Captain America, Black Widow,

355
00:33:30,995 --> 00:33:37,287
Daredevil, Spider-Man, Luke Cage, and Wolverine
in a top secret coup of the nation of Latveria.

356
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:43,773
At the time, Latveria's monarch, Dr. Doom, was
trapped in hell due to dark bargains he had

357
00:33:43,833 --> 00:33:50,120
made earlier. Latveria's new prime minister,
named Lucia von Bardis, was covertly funding

358
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:56,065
America's supervillains as a way to wreak terror
on American soil. Nick Fury found evidence

359
00:33:56,085 --> 00:34:00,770
of this, though the government administration
at the time refused to act on the intel. Nick

360
00:34:00,810 --> 00:34:05,434
Fury found his hand forced and took his secret
recruitment of heroes to Latveria, including

361
00:34:05,474 --> 00:34:11,900
Daisy, to quietly take Lucia von Bardis out.
However, one year later, von Bardis returned

362
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,045
as a cyborg with a cybernetic army to enact
revenge against the heroes involved in Fury's

363
00:34:17,105 --> 00:34:22,570
operation. Daisy and the others fought to disable
a bomb that von Bardis used to try and destroy

364
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:28,303
New York City, and Daisy herself destroyed the
cyborg threat. You can learn more about Liberia

365
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:33,327
and Doctor Doom in his duel against Superman,
and more about Nick Fury in his duel against

366
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:38,732
Rick Flag. When Nick Fury's Liberian coup came
to light, he was ousted from S.H.I.E.L.D. and

367
00:34:38,772 --> 00:34:45,158
replaced by new director Maria Hill, who removed
Daisy from duty. Although inactive, Daisy helped

368
00:34:45,178 --> 00:34:50,443
the X-Men fight Magneto on the island of Genosha,
where she proved instrumental in knocking the

369
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:56,038
villain unconscious by inducing vibrations in
his brain. Not long after, Nick Fury returned

370
00:34:56,098 --> 00:35:01,800
to draft Daisy into his covert team of secret
warriors to fight clandestine threats. This

371
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:07,081
included the secret invasion of alien Skrulls
on Earth and stopping secret cells of the evil

372
00:35:07,121 --> 00:35:12,423
organization Hydra around the world. After the
Skrulls defeat and the dissolution of SHIELD,

373
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:18,104
Daisy was drafted into the Avengers and was
tasked with spying on Norman Osborn, who had

374
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:19,705
taken advantage of the SHIELD power

375
00:35:22,874 --> 00:35:28,438
and the Dark Avengers. Captain America ended
up reactivating SHIELD and appointed Daisy

376
00:35:28,799 --> 00:35:34,463
as its new director, where she was now in charge
of the entire operation. However, her decision

377
00:35:34,483 --> 00:35:38,667
to assassinate the leader of the scientific
criminal organization AIM led to her being

378
00:35:38,707 --> 00:35:44,111
demoted and replaced as SHIELD director by Maria
Hill. You can learn more about the Avengers

379
00:35:44,231 --> 00:35:48,935
in their duel episode against the Justice League.
Back as a SHIELD agent, Daisy went on a mission

380
00:35:48,975 --> 00:35:54,526
to locate and retrieve her father, Mr. Hyde.
She sought his help in fixing her powers, which

381
00:35:54,566 --> 00:35:59,287
had begun to take their toll on her body, causing
her bones to splinter and sometimes shatter.

382
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:03,989
Feeling affection for his daughter, Mr. Hyde
was able to cure her, but then tried to inject

383
00:36:04,009 --> 00:36:08,870
her with his Hyde formula, claiming that it
would protect her. Agent Phil Coulson took

384
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:14,172
the injection instead in an effort to spare
Daisy, and he and Mr. Hyde fought, giving Daisy

385
00:36:14,212 --> 00:36:19,293
enough time to use her restored powers to create
a fissure in the ground that swallowed her

386
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:25,120
father whole. And that's her backstory. Powers-wise,
Quake is an inhuman with the innate ability

387
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,143
to generate seismic vibrations, the magnitude
of which she can control via a pair of gauntlets

388
00:36:30,163 --> 00:36:35,287
she wears on her wrists. Her vibrations can
be so powerful and widespread as to create

389
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:40,451
a massive earthquake that topples buildings
or so small and targeted as to explode the

390
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:46,035
heart in someone's chest. The vibrations can
be forceful enough to shatter objects or delicate

391
00:36:46,075 --> 00:36:51,798
enough to render someone unconscious. As an
inhuman, Quake has innately enhanced physicality,

392
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:57,741
including greater reflexes, durability, and
strength than any human athlete. She is a highly

393
00:36:57,781 --> 00:37:03,944
trained fighter taught by Nick Fury and Shield,
an elite spy, and an intelligent strategist.

394
00:37:04,344 --> 00:37:09,166
And that's Quake. So what you're basically saying
is that anything Quake can do, Geoforce can

395
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:14,348
do, and then some. Can he shatter the heart
in someone's chest? I mean, yeah, by putting

396
00:37:14,388 --> 00:37:17,389
his fist through it. Okay, all right, okay.

397
00:37:24,334 --> 00:37:30,021
Where fantasies collide and heroes clash, one
podcast network rises above the rest. Prepare

398
00:37:30,041 --> 00:37:35,769
yourself for the ultimate showdowns in comic
books, video games, movies, and anime. The

399
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:41,516
DynaMic Podcast Network presents Console Combat,
where video game legends brawl every Monday.

400
00:37:41,536 --> 00:37:48,205
DynaMic Podcast Network Comic Book Titans smash
every Tuesday, Max Destruction, where TV and

401
00:37:48,305 --> 00:37:54,609
action heroes battle every Wednesday, and Sendro
World, where anime champions clash every Thursday.

402
00:37:55,129 --> 00:38:00,132
Join us as we speculate on the matches and,
armed with the power of mathematical simulations,

403
00:38:00,373 --> 00:38:07,277
discover who will emerge victorious. Visit dynamicpodcast.com
where we settle the debate and settle the score.

404
00:38:11,575 --> 00:38:15,537
Well now that we got their histories and abilities
out of the way, let's speculate on how one

405
00:38:15,557 --> 00:38:21,061
of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The winner
is determined by simulations, not the speculation,

406
00:38:21,221 --> 00:38:26,485
but it's fun to imagine how the fight could
play out. AJ9K, what are the rules of our speculation?

407
00:38:27,385 --> 00:38:31,388
Well I should say there are no rules, other
than the characters have no prior knowledge

408
00:38:31,408 --> 00:38:35,811
of the other going into the fight. All they
are aware of starting out is that the other

409
00:38:35,831 --> 00:38:40,658
character is a threat that needs to be eliminated.
For the speculation... The contestants will

410
00:38:40,678 --> 00:38:46,022
begin approximately 50 meters apart in a nondescript
environment that will have no bearing on the

411
00:38:46,042 --> 00:38:51,386
match itself, as no environmental statistics
are considered in my simulations. The contestants

412
00:38:51,446 --> 00:38:57,391
must earn victory on their own merit. Alright
then, let's get into it. Geoforce and Quake

413
00:38:57,491 --> 00:39:03,996
meet on the battlefield. Who goes first? Well,
Quake is an inhuman, so she has greater reflexes,

414
00:39:04,156 --> 00:39:09,198
slightly. I'm going to say that she goes first.
and she's just gonna let rip a wide blast of

415
00:39:09,278 --> 00:39:14,320
seismic vibrations from her hands that just
tear across the ground and slam into Geoforce,

416
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:19,761
sending him flying backward onto the floor.
Okay, Geoforce, you know, he was caught off

417
00:39:19,781 --> 00:39:25,483
guard by the attack, but he's gonna land gently
on the ground thanks to his manipulation of

418
00:39:25,523 --> 00:39:31,244
gravity, and once he does, he quickly opens
up a fissure beneath Quake that just sprays

419
00:39:31,284 --> 00:39:37,402
her with hot lava. No, cause Quake will see
the fissure opening up beneath her. and she's

420
00:39:37,422 --> 00:39:43,605
gonna shoot her vibrations down into the fissure
and the lava below her, keeping the lava from

421
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:49,587
boiling up and spilling out, and the downward
blast is just gonna propel her away from the

422
00:39:49,627 --> 00:39:55,950
fissure, and when the lava does come out of
it, she's gonna use her vibrations to guide

423
00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:02,052
the lava across the battlefield like this lava
wave that's just gonna fall on top of GeoForce

424
00:40:02,072 --> 00:40:08,455
and just scald the shit out of them. through
lava and like shoots it out of his hands. What?

425
00:40:08,475 --> 00:40:13,478
He's not gonna be hurt by it. All right. So
instead of getting scalded, he's just gonna

426
00:40:13,558 --> 00:40:19,761
blast that wave coming at him with a torrent
of his own lava that then crashes right into

427
00:40:19,841 --> 00:40:27,366
Quake. So now she's burned up. No, cause Quake's
gonna shake the ground beneath her and cause

428
00:40:27,506 --> 00:40:33,109
a convergence so that this giant piece of land
just juts up right in front of her. And she

429
00:40:33,169 --> 00:40:38,210
uses that as a shield. So the lava never reaches
her. Quake is gonna blast herself into the

430
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:43,052
air again, sending herself over to GeoForce,
and she crash lands right on top of him, legs

431
00:40:43,072 --> 00:40:48,313
first, where she does the, you know, like the
Black Widow, Lucha Libra style flip, and she

432
00:40:48,333 --> 00:40:54,575
just flips him onto the ground, onto his back.
Okay, so as she was about to land on him, suddenly

433
00:40:54,615 --> 00:40:59,096
though, she's just floating in the air, right
above him, because he nullified the gravity

434
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:05,590
around her so that she can't land. So now she's
just trapped in the air. and he's gonna summon

435
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:11,872
a giant fist made of rock to shoot up from the
ground beneath her and just uppercut her right

436
00:41:11,912 --> 00:41:17,993
into the sky. No, because as she's stuck in
midair with this stone fist beneath her, she's

437
00:41:18,013 --> 00:41:24,555
gonna like force blast karate chop this giant
fist in half as it rises up and the shock waves

438
00:41:24,575 --> 00:41:29,596
that she generates to break the stone fist in
half also shakes the ground beneath Geoforce

439
00:41:30,056 --> 00:41:35,402
and that causes him to lose his concentration
so he drops her. And her gravity is restored

440
00:41:35,862 --> 00:41:42,064
and she lands on the ground next to Geoforce
and just leg sweeps him. Okay, but as Geoforce

441
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:48,126
is falling, he's gonna increase his gravity
so that he actually slams into the ground hard

442
00:41:48,166 --> 00:41:54,567
enough to generate this massive crater that
Quake is also gonna fall into. And at the bottom

443
00:41:54,587 --> 00:42:00,529
of this deep crater, Geoforce is gonna levitate
all of the rock shrapnel that's all around

444
00:42:00,549 --> 00:42:06,204
them and he's just gonna- send it flying at
Quake, just pummeling her with it, not stop,

445
00:42:06,544 --> 00:42:10,807
essentially stoning her to death. Now, Quake
is just gonna disintegrate all these stones

446
00:42:10,867 --> 00:42:16,231
flying at her one by one. You know, they just
turn into dust. And she's just like really

447
00:42:16,251 --> 00:42:21,875
annoyed by this point, you know, just dealing
with GeoForce. So she continues by disintegrating

448
00:42:22,035 --> 00:42:31,201
GeoForce's nuts, turning those into powder.
No! And he's like, oh my God, my nuts! Oh no.

449
00:42:31,221 --> 00:42:37,889
Okay. Uh, so Joe Force, you know, he's gonna
drop instantly to the ground. Yeah. And, uh,

450
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:42,612
actually he's going to like drop into the ground.
It's just going to envelop him and bury him

451
00:42:43,152 --> 00:42:50,657
and underground. He's able to rapidly heal and
regenerate his balls. What? Quick. She's going

452
00:42:50,677 --> 00:42:55,480
to be busy trying to climb out of this giant
crater that he created, but it's too fucking

453
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:01,716
late. It's super volcano time, right? So this
is basically a huge lava bomb that just decimates

454
00:43:02,096 --> 00:43:08,139
everything around it for miles. No way she could
escape in time. So she dead. I don't think

455
00:43:08,179 --> 00:43:14,503
so. I mean, if GeoForce is busy hiding like
a punk ass deep underground, that's also Quake's

456
00:43:14,543 --> 00:43:20,306
domain. Quake is gonna shake the ground beneath
her so hard that it pummeled GeoForce to death.

457
00:43:20,366 --> 00:43:24,668
Just like he's gonna get rattled around down
there and his body's gonna get crushed into

458
00:43:24,689 --> 00:43:29,996
pieces. That's match over. Dude, she doesn't
know where underground he was. All she has

459
00:43:30,016 --> 00:43:34,398
to do is aim down. She just shakes all the ground
beneath her. He's somewhere down there. That's

460
00:43:34,418 --> 00:43:39,542
where he dies. Okay, I mean, that's probably
a good place to leave off the match. Either

461
00:43:40,102 --> 00:43:49,268
Quake gets decimated in a super volcanic eruption
or GeoForce gets essentially flattened by an

462
00:43:49,348 --> 00:43:53,331
earthquake while he's busy healing underground.
We'll go ahead and leave the match there. We'll

463
00:43:53,351 --> 00:43:59,115
input the character stats, run a thousand simulations
and come back with a winner. AG9K, hit it.

464
00:43:59,675 --> 00:44:07,021
Inputting data, running calculations, processing
results, simulations complete. Okay, so stat

465
00:44:07,041 --> 00:44:13,826
wise, this was a horrible matchup. Well, I thought
it would kind of turn out the same way as Terra

466
00:44:13,846 --> 00:44:19,462
versus Avalanche, but there were a lot of notable
differences between Avalanche and. Quake. As

467
00:44:19,502 --> 00:44:24,703
well as some notable differences between Terra
and GeoForce, surprisingly. Yeah, GeoForce

468
00:44:24,883 --> 00:44:30,125
not only has all the abilities of Terra, but
he also has the added benefit of being able

469
00:44:30,145 --> 00:44:35,927
to control lava and heat and gravity as well.
Yeah, which is pretty dumb. I mean, Quake is

470
00:44:35,947 --> 00:44:40,528
a powerhouse. Both of these guys are, you know,
off the charts in terms of damage level and

471
00:44:40,568 --> 00:44:43,969
the amount of destruction that they're able
to cause. They're both pretty comparable when

472
00:44:44,009 --> 00:44:48,972
it comes to things, you know, like... fighting
skill, evasiveness, range. We said GeoForce

473
00:44:48,992 --> 00:44:53,695
had the edge though when it came to things like
perception. Because he could sense things underground.

474
00:44:54,135 --> 00:44:58,759
Yeah, and durability, because I guess he can
increase his own personal mass by increasing

475
00:44:58,819 --> 00:45:03,362
his gravity. Right, we also said he had the
edge when it came to versatility and when it

476
00:45:03,382 --> 00:45:08,886
came to speed because he could rocket himself
pretty fast through the air. Well, Quake is

477
00:45:08,906 --> 00:45:15,074
an inhuman and she can run really fast. So,
considering all of the stats, Joseph. Who do

478
00:45:15,094 --> 00:45:21,517
you think came out on top? Quake. You are lying
to yourself. No, do not lie to yourself. I

479
00:45:21,557 --> 00:45:26,520
have my reasons. Oh yeah, what are they? Their
personal reasons. Okay, well what did the Instagram

480
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:31,843
poll say? I don't fucking know. What are you
doing? 58% of the people on Instagram who took

481
00:45:31,903 --> 00:45:36,725
the poll said that Geoforce would take this,
which is surprising to me because I feel like

482
00:45:36,765 --> 00:45:41,808
Quake is fairly well known, especially among
people who watched Agents of Shield. Everybody

483
00:45:41,828 --> 00:45:46,618
knows, you know, Chloe Bennett, right? And Quake.
They know she's hot, but they don't know that

484
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:52,720
Quake can be GeoForce because she can't. At
least I'm pretty confident she can't. Let's

485
00:45:52,760 --> 00:46:01,562
find out. AJ9K, the results please. Hey Yuasa.
The winner of the matchup between GeoForce

486
00:46:02,142 --> 00:46:11,085
and Quake is... GeoForce! Obviously! What do
you mean obviously? I mean obviously! He won

487
00:46:11,285 --> 00:46:23,710
82.4% of the 1000 matches. or 824 of those compared
to Quake, who only won 176 or 17.6%. This is

488
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:29,535
one of the most lopsided matches we've ever
done, and you my friend I think have just received

489
00:46:29,575 --> 00:46:35,861
a rude awakening about not only the popularity
of Quake, but also the power of Quake. Yeah,

490
00:46:35,881 --> 00:46:43,290
she's super powerful. At sucking and losing.
You know... Those kind of results just signify

491
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:48,292
that maybe this wasn't the best matchup. Which
is strange because, you know, Avalanche vs.

492
00:46:48,312 --> 00:46:53,293
Terra wasn't that bad of a matchup. I know that
when the executive producers were helping us

493
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:58,775
develop this match, we had also considered other
characters besides Quake, including Magma,

494
00:46:58,915 --> 00:47:03,557
because she could control lava and rock as well,
as well as Richter, who is kind of a similar

495
00:47:03,597 --> 00:47:08,099
character to Avalanche. But we ended up going
with Quake. because she's popular, because

496
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:12,241
she's a badass, and because she can use her
seismic abilities in a variety of ways. Probably

497
00:47:12,261 --> 00:47:16,825
should have gone with Magma. Magma would have
been a great match, for sure. But I feel like

498
00:47:17,265 --> 00:47:21,648
these results would be different because I think
every time Geoforce would just get his heart

499
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:27,832
exploded and or nuts every time. There's no
instance of any battle between these two where

500
00:47:27,932 --> 00:47:31,495
one of those things doesn't happen. Yeah, how's
that gonna happen when she's too busy being

501
00:47:31,575 --> 00:47:37,636
burned alive in lava? She'll get over it, it's
fine. Sure. Sure she will. Clearly she won't.

502
00:47:38,096 --> 00:47:44,643
Clearly Geoforce wins. Cause Geoforce is awesome.
Have fun taking Kimon again in our team duel

503
00:47:44,723 --> 00:47:50,229
between the Outsiders and X-Force. Oh I can't
wait to. I can't wait to. Can't wait to lose?

504
00:47:50,449 --> 00:47:57,446
I bet. But that does it for this duel. AG9K
help close this out. Thanks for listening to

to be another duel episode that will be a tie-in
to our upcoming team duel. Next week, we're

511
00:48:31,522 --> 00:48:37,247
going to find out who would win in a fight between
Halo, who is an outsider's character, against

512
00:48:37,387 --> 00:48:42,791
Power Pack, who is a group of superhero kids
who were pretty popular with Marvel back in

513
00:48:42,811 --> 00:48:47,014
the day. I think their popularity has waned
a little bit, but they're pretty interesting,

514
00:48:47,355 --> 00:48:51,866
cool characters. Yeah, I don't know really anything
about them. I- Just know that this will be

515
00:48:51,906 --> 00:48:57,628
the first time where you have a group of characters
that goes up against one of my characters in

516
00:48:57,648 --> 00:49:03,009
a similar way where the metal man went up against
Colossus in that duel episode. Right, right.

517
00:49:03,029 --> 00:49:08,091
We'll figure out how to do the stats when the
time comes. That's future us's problem. But

518
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:11,772
that does it for this episode, we want to give
a big thanks to our executive producers Ken

and Joseph Kirsting for helping make this podcast

522
00:49:29,162 --> 00:49:34,625
possible. And we'll talk to you guys next week.
Up up and away, true believers. I think I win

523
00:49:34,765 --> 00:49:37,007
because paper beats rock and I got that paper
baby.
