00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,480
This is a DynaMic Network Podcast. Hi and welcome
to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show where we

2
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,040
review superhero films and debate the
superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing

3
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,020
their characters in stat-based battle
simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe and I'm his twin

4
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,420
brother Johnny DC. And in this episode we're going
to find out who would win in a fight between

5
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:49,320
Elongated Man versus Medusa. Now Elongated Man is
a stretchy DC character with the most perverted

6
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,860
name and existence against Medusa who has no
relation to the Greek mythological character

7
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,380
except for, you know, they both have interesting
things going on with their hair. Yeah, Elongated

8
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:07,160
Man is a fairly popular character in DC so I'm
surprised that it's taken us this long to get to a

9
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:12,920
dual episode with him and the same kind of goes for
Medusa I feel. Yeah, so far we've only done one

10
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,520
inhuman unless you count Miss Marvel Kamala Khan,
but yeah, that was Black Bolt in our Shazam vs.

11
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,340
Black Bolt episode and, you know, that's a mistake
because I love the inhumans and I'm really excited

12
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,980
to get back into those characters with this duel.
But before we find out who wins between these two

13
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,720
characters, we're going to break down the latest
comic book movie news this past week of which there

14
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,220
was none. So we're not going to do that. Yeah, we are
going to give you guys a special update on the

notes to listen to all the shows in the DynaMic
podcast network. But with that out of the way,

36
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:41,580
quick to the no prize! A no prize is an award that
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version, the

37
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:47,000
Dynamic Dual No Prize, is a digital award that we
post on Instagram for the person that we feel gave

38
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,960
the best answer to our question of the week. Last
week, we asked you guys, what's your favorite

39
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,980
theory as to why Victor Von Doom would look like
Tony Stark? Right, this is coming off the news that

40
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:05,160
Avengers Doomsday has been pushed back here.
We've all been eagerly anticipating the film, but

41
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:09,340
we're going to have to wait until December of 2026
to see it. In the meantime, we thought it would be

42
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:17,339
interesting to get your ideas on why, God, why
would they cast Robert Dunney Jr. as Dr. Doom and

43
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:22,480
how could that best be rationalized? We actually
got quite a number of answers, but quite a few of you

44
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,920
guys repeated your answers. So we still have only
three honorable mentions and one no prize winner.

45
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:35,560
Our first honorable mention goes to by Dear
Bangura and Jutson Batty. Who said? Hello Dynamic

46
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:42,680
Dual, I think that a good theory would be that
Victor Von Doom implanted his brain inside Tony

47
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,500
Stark's body. Very similar to Superius
Spider-Man with Doc Oub. I think he was trying to

48
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:53,600
make him a superior Iron Man. Maybe Marvel will
follow that storyline and kind of blend in with

49
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:01,860
this one and give us the best version of Tony Stark
possible. Thank you. Hi guys, Jutson Batty here. I

50
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:10,200
think that my favorite theory as to why Doom looks
like Stark in Avengers Doom is that in his reality,

51
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:17,800
it was a play on the superior Spider-Man story.
Instead of it being Doc Ock and Spider-Man, it was

52
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:24,680
Doom and Stark being that Doom gets some form of
cancer that would kill him somehow and capacitate

53
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,380
Iron Man. It takes his body and Iron Man dies
instead. Alright, so they both gave the same

54
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:34,940
answer, essentially theorizing that the Dr. Doom
Iron Man relationship is going to be similar to the

55
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,420
superior Spider-Man relationship between Dr.
Ock to Puss and Spider-Man in that comic book

56
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:43,760
storyline. Which is a theory that I haven't heard
before. I think it's a pretty interesting one.

57
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,660
Essentially, they're saying that an alternate
reality, Dr. Doom, is going to somehow

58
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:54,380
telepathically or otherwise implant his mind
into an alternate reality, Tony Stark's body, and

59
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:00,640
then come into the main 616 universe. Which is an
interesting idea, but it's not necessarily an

60
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:06,520
idea that I love because I can't come up with any
kind of justification for why Doom would take over

61
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:12,840
Tony Stark's body when he could easily just
probably create a clone of his former body. Like

62
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:18,260
there's no advantage to having Tony Stark's body
unless you don't want a functioning heart. Well,

63
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:23,060
one could say that the motivation would be
deception. Dr. Doom puts his mind in alternate

64
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:28,460
reality, Tony Stark's body, who comes to Earth
pretending to be Tony Stark. I'd rather have

65
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:35,360
Doom's face hidden the entire time behind a dope
metallic mask. I don't need that kind of level of

66
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,400
deception. Maybe Doom's plan does, we'll see.
Great answer by Deer and Judson, our next

67
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:47,080
honorable mention goes to Lorenzo Valdez. Who
said? This is Lorenzo Valdez calling in once

68
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:54,420
again. What I keep going back to with RDJ as Dr. Doom
is the Superboy TV show, where at the beginning of

69
00:06:54,420 --> 00:07:01,340
season 2, Lex Luthor gets plastic surgery to look
like another character, Warren Eckworth. And I'm

70
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:05,980
wondering whether Dr. Doom has done something
similar, and whether he's perhaps trying to pose

71
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:12,980
as Tony Stark, or revive Tony Stark, to infiltrate
the Avengers. Clon of forever and always,

72
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:18,380
buh-bye. Yeah, this is a similar type of situation
as the previous answer, except instead of being an

73
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:23,720
alternate reality, Dr. Doom inserting his mind
into an alternate reality, Tony Stark's body, it

74
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:29,200
is Dr. Doom getting plastic surgery to look like
the deceased Tony Stark. So face off,

75
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,960
essentially. Yeah, yeah. The reason I find this
particular theory unsatisfying, and same thing

76
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,140
with the Superior Spider-Man theory, is that it
doesn't give enough space for the character of

77
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:46,280
Victor Von Doom to be his own character prior to
this deceptive plan. So in that case, we will never

78
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:52,400
really get a good sense of who this guy is, what he
looks like, before we dive in head first into, oh,

79
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,240
this appears to be Tony Stark, and like acts like
Tony Stark, and all this stuff. And it just bothers

80
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:02,200
me because Victor Von Doom is such an interesting
character in the comic books, and really truly has

81
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:08,320
not been done justice in the films, and deserves to
be. Right, at least even in the movie Face Off, in

82
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:14,900
the first act, you got a sense of who the characters
were before they switched faces. Exactly,

83
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:21,200
exactly. Great answer, Lorenzo. Our final
honorable mention goes to Alex Albro, who said,

84
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,560
Hey guys, I think it plays out similar to the MCU
with a few twists. Instead of getting stranded in

85
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,760
Afghanistan, he gets stranded in Laveria, uses
the Ten Rings to help him take over the country,

86
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,760
still feels the need for a suit of armor around the
world, builds Ultron, which turns into the

87
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,200
Doombots. And since he can't save his mother in
this universe, as the universe's collapsed, he

88
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,680
trails the Fantastic Four to the 616, back in time
to save his mother from the Winter Soldier, and

89
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:50,680
he's been here all along. So yeah, this is the type
of scenario that I'm really hoping that Marvel

90
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:57,140
does not actually go down. What he poses is that an
alternate reality, Tony Stark, named Victor Von

91
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:03,840
Doom, goes through the same essential arc of being
a weapons designer who gets captured and taken to

92
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,500
Laveria, instead of Afghanistan like Tony Stark
did in the first Iron Man movie. And then takes over

93
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,400
the country, proposes the Ultron program, which
turns into Doombots, and then comes into our

94
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:19,620
reality to stop his mom from dying by the hands of
the Winter Soldier. So that's what I don't want to

95
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,900
happen. I don't want the character of Victor Von
Doom to essentially be Tony Stark, because Victor

96
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,780
Von Doom's actual origin story from the comic
books is much more interesting than just being an

97
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:37,360
alternate reality rehash of the MCU's Tony Stark.
Yeah, it may sound petty, but I think Victor Von

98
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,920
Doom should be done more justice than just being a
Tony Stark variant. Right, exactly. Yeah. That's

99
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,060
what I don't want. I don't want him to be a Tony Stark
variant, necessarily. I mean, there's one theory

100
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:53,060
that was not called in as an answer that I'll
discuss in a minute here, but for the most part,

101
00:09:53,060 --> 00:10:00,180
yeah, I would not like Dr. Doom to be a variant. That
said, if Victor Von Doom was going to be a variant of

102
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:06,400
Tony Stark, that was a very creative way of going
about that. So still, great answer, Alex. But the

103
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:13,020
winner, or should I say winners of this week's No
Prize are Travis Herndon and Cyrus Moore. Who

104
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:19,700
said? Well, so the name of the dude's Travis here,
shut up to my twin. So my theory is that what if RDJ is

105
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:25,000
a red herring? Like they actually hired someone
else to play Victor and they're keeping it hush

106
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,960
hush. So when at the end of Doomsday, we actually
get the true reveal of the actual actor who's

107
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:38,040
playing Doom, Marvel would then pretty much pull
the biggest, got y'all, fuck all of you guys that

108
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:44,960
were doubting us moment in MCU history if that was
the case. Hey guys, Cyrus Moore here. So my

109
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:51,820
ultimate theory is that Tony Stark is coming back
as Victor Von Doom is actually just an illusion.

110
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:58,740
It's just a mass effect. Marvel's actually going
to have Tony Stark come back and be Iron Man, and

111
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:04,100
they will cast somebody else as Von Doom. Because
you know the only character to stay dead is Uncle

112
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:10,400
Ben. So yeah, I think Iron Man's coming back.
Alright, this may be wishful thinking on my part

113
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:16,340
and probably most fans who don't like the idea of
Robert Downey Jr. being Iron Man, but it would be

114
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:23,760
pretty impressive if Marvel was playing this kind
of long con where they announced Robert Downey Jr.

115
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:31,200
as being cast as Victor Von Doom. And then it turns
out that it was all just a scam and that he's

116
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,820
actually coming back as Iron Man and the character
of Doctor Doom is played by a different actor. I

117
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:41,920
don't think that's likely. I think it would be far
more likely that maybe Robert Downey Jr. plays

118
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:47,580
Doctor Doom for like the first movie at which point
at the end he gets reverted to his true form and then

119
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:54,040
we see another actor like pull away the disguise as
a were and show us who the real Doctor Doom is. I

120
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,720
think that is still potentially a possibility,
but Marvel pulling off something like that I think

121
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,660
would be exciting and would be something that I
would actually love to see. Yeah, one thing about

122
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:12,460
the Marvel fandom is that they're always trying to
figure out all of the secrets that Marvel may or may

123
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:18,420
not have. Like when it came to, you know,
Spider-Man No Way Home. Like everyone knew what

124
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:23,400
the spoiler for that film was going to be before we
even saw it. It was still exciting when we learned

125
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,780
that Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield would be in
the movie, but I think it would be cooler if

126
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:33,580
sometimes we didn't know all the secrets or
couldn't figure out all the secrets ahead of time.

127
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:41,780
If Marvel is really just punking all the fans, I
would actually love that. I'm so sick of all of the

128
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:48,360
Marvel speculation and rumors. I don't give a shit
about it because, well, one, I'm a DC guy, but also

129
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:54,480
two, like there's no way you're going to know until
you see the actual movie. So just stop. Right. I

130
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,140
mean, speculation is fun, but there's a limit to
what I can tolerate even as a Marvel fan. I think

131
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:04,140
essentially lying to fans is probably the best
means at this point of actually retaining some

132
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,680
sort of surprise, as they did with Spider-Man No
Way Home. They basically lied and said these guys

133
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,760
weren't in the movie, but then it turned out they
were. But the lie just has to be maintained and

134
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:19,140
believable. We'll end up seeing what happens. In
regards to my statement that there was another

135
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:23,820
theory out there that I liked. I think we talked
about it on this podcast before. But if Victor Von

136
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:29,300
Doom is going to be a Tony Stark variant in this
cinematic multiverse, then I also want Chris

137
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:36,360
Evans and Scarlett Johansson to come back as evil
variant versions of their characters. So like

138
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:44,180
Hydra Cap along with Superior Iron Man version of
Doctor Doom and maybe Scar Joe as like Madamask or

139
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:48,660
something like that. That's the only way I can see
this working if it's not just Robert Downey Jr.

140
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:54,720
coming back, but other original Avengers actors
coming back as variants of their former roles.

141
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,860
Something like that I think could be pretty cool.
And that's probably the only way I'll accept Doom

142
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,400
being a variant of Tony Stark. But thanks to
everyone who called in and congrats to Travis

143
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,700
Herndon and Cyrus Moore for winning this week's No
Prize. If you the listener want a shot at winning

144
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:11,780
your own No Prize, stay tuned to later on this
episode when we'll be asking another question of

145
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:22,100
the week. And now that that's done, on to the news.
Alright, in one of the biggest announcements for

146
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:29,600
this podcast, we want to let you guys know like
seven months in advance that in mid January on the

147
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:36,840
10th anniversary of this podcast, Jonathan and I
will be ending Dynamic Duel as we all know it. That

148
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:41,380
doesn't mean that we're going away forever. It
just means that Dynamic Duel will no longer be

149
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:47,360
putting out a weekly show. By the time that mid
January comes around, Jonathan and I will be

150
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,600
turning 40. And as many of you listeners may know,
we started this podcast on our 30th birthday. And

151
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:02,040
we feel that 10 years is a long time to exhaust any
single topic, especially one like Marvel vs DC.

152
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:09,240
Yeah, it was interesting. We started this podcast
because DC that year was releasing Batman v

153
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:15,800
Superman and essentially kicking off their very
own shared cinematic universe to compete with the

154
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:22,760
MCU. And that was a big ol' failure. Apparently.
But I thought it was kind of fitting that we would

155
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:30,240
kind of end the podcast once that journey was over
and as DC is kicking off a new universe. So we

156
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,260
started the show with the birth of one DC universe
and we're ending it with the birth of another. Now

157
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:42,580
the weekly format will be going away for the show,
but we will still be doing film reviews of the

158
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:48,660
upcoming Marvel and DC theatrical projects. And
maybe some television shows as well. I'm not quite

159
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,920
sure. Right. We're still going to be on Ron
Tomatoes. We're still going to be here just not

160
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:59,140
every week for you guys. Yeah. And to that end, the
executive producers have determined the

161
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:03,760
remaining dual episodes that we'll be doing
throughout the rest of this calendar year into

162
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:09,500
next January. So the main reason we're announcing
this now is because if there are any potential

163
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:14,400
executive producers out there, and I had to tell
Paul Graves this, who is our newest executive

164
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:20,660
producer, basically the role of the executive
producer was to determine the content calendar of

165
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:26,560
this show and pitch dual ideas and things like
that. All the duels are figured out for the rest of

166
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:34,040
the show. And so the main role of the executive
producer now is to determine in what order those

167
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:39,320
duels will be coming out. So I don't want to
discourage anyone from supporting this podcast,

168
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,580
but if you do become an executive producer from
here on out, just know that the responsibility of

169
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:49,080
that role has kind of shifted. Yeah. If you've been
a supporter of this podcast, you've known about

170
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:54,900
this news for a while and it's kind of bittersweet.
But we're all really looking forward to the

171
00:16:54,900 --> 00:17:00,440
upcoming schedule we have for the remainder of
this year. And the final episodes in particular

172
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,640
are just going to be amazing. I almost can't wait
for them. Yeah. In some ways next year can't come

173
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,099
soon enough. And in other ways, it'll be hard to
stop doing a weekly show, you know, something that

174
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:16,780
we've done for literally a decade consistently.
We've never missed a drop date, even while sick.

175
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:23,040
Even while at the hospital having a kid. Yeah, I
guess I did miss that episode for sure. But I did

176
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,619
not. Hopefully this doesn't come as like a sad
announcement to a lot of our listeners out there.

177
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:33,400
Hopefully you guys understand that doing this for
10 years is a long time. And we still love doing the

178
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,660
show, though, and we can't wait to continue
putting out more episodes for you guys. Finally,

179
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:43,680
solving this Marvel vs DC debate and shutting my
twin brother up once and for all. Yes, those exact

180
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:52,440
words. But regarding this announcement, that
brings us to our question of the week. How did you

181
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:57,540
find Dynamic Duel and how long have you been
listening to the show? Yes, sometimes our

182
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:03,120
questions are more market research than looking
for editorials from you guys. But with the news

183
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,300
that the show will be ending as it currently
exists, we would just love to hear from some of our

184
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:11,240
listeners. Record your answer at
dynamicduel.com by clicking on the red

185
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,700
microphone button in the bottom right hand corner
of the screen, which will prompt you to leave us a

186
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:20,880
voicemail. Your message could be up to 30 seconds
long, and don't forget to leave your name in case we

187
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,580
include you on the podcast. We'll pick our
favorite answer and award that person a Dynamic

188
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:38,960
Duel No Prize that we'll post to Instagram. Be sure
to answer before June 7th. But I think that does it

189
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,960
for the news portion of this episode, so let's go
ahead and move into our main event. Where we find

190
00:18:43,960 --> 00:19:05,560
out who would win in a fight between elongated man
and the inhuman Medusa. All right, elongated man

191
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:11,880
versus Medusa. The primary reason we are doing
this duel, not only because these characters can

192
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,360
stretch, but also they're going to lead into
future team duels that we have planned in the

193
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,700
coming months, including the Justice League
International versus the West Coast Avengers and

194
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:27,060
Wildcats versus the Inhumans. Of course,
elongated man was a member of the Justice League

195
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:31,460
and Medusa is a member of the Inhumans, and we
wanted to make sure to touch on these characters

196
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:35,560
specifically before their team duels because we
feel they're interesting and important enough

197
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:41,960
characters to delve deeper into. I don't know if
listeners have noticed yet, but Jonathan and I are

198
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,040
just plowing through the team duels in essence
trying to get through as many characters as

199
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:53,020
possible before this upcoming January. Yeah,
doing one team duel a month was going to be the only

200
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:58,800
way we could get through all of the team battles
that we were hoping to get through before moving on

201
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:05,380
from the current iteration of this show. Now, if
you're an avid fan of the Flash television series

202
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:12,320
on the CW, you are familiar with elongated man. He
was a member of the Flash's superhero team

203
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:20,160
essentially in the later seasons of the show, and
you may also remember Medusa from a really, really

204
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:27,300
shitty Inhumans live action series. It was so bad,
which is such a shame. I really wanted to like the

205
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,220
Inhumans series because it was being released in
IMAX and everything like that. And Jonathan and I

206
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:36,940
even went to our local IMAX theater to see the
Inhumans pilot episode essentially, and we were

207
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:41,940
severely disappointed. We actually did a review
of it on this podcast when it came out. And I thought

208
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:48,000
Serendis Swan, the actress who played Medusa, was
pretty well cast. A lot of the cast was actually

209
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,840
pretty good, but everything else in the show
really sucked. It's probably the worst thing

210
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:58,000
Marvel television has ever put out, and that's a
shame because the Inhumans deserve better. Yeah,

211
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,340
I've always thought that Inhumans were pretty
cool. I would agree with that. Before we get into

212
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:05,820
this dual matchup to explain the methodology
behind our duels, let's go to our sentient dual

213
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:11,900
simulator, Alfred Jarvis 9000. AJ and IK tell our
listeners how you go about determining a winner in

214
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:17,200
our dual matchups. Yes, of course, sir. The way I
determine a winner between the contestants is by

215
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,620
running 1,000 Monte Carlo simulations using the
characters statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation

216
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:28,160
is a probabilistic model used to determine
outcomes through random sampling. In this case, I

217
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,340
randomize the statistics along a normal
distribution as a way to simulate the many

218
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:37,280
variables that can occur during battle. The stat
parameters are based on the official Marvel power

219
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,560
grid from which the DC characters statistics are
extrapolated. Additional stat categories are

220
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:48,080
included such as range, damage potential,
versatility and perception in order to create a

221
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:53,020
more detailed and accurate simulation. The
results of the 1,000 simulations provide a

222
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:57,000
percentage of wins for each character. The
contestant with the higher percentage is

223
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,840
declared the victor as they have a higher
probability to win any given battle. In an

224
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:07,240
equitable pairing, neither character should win
100% of the matches. The comic book stories have

225
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:12,100
shown that there's even a way for Batman to defeat
Superman, so the confidence rate of my method

226
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,180
falls in line with the precedents that have been
established in the source material. My

227
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,640
mathematical simulations are without
subjectivity or bias. Feats are not the sole

228
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:27,200
consideration, nor are fan votes tabulated for
determination of the winner. Thanks, AJ9K.

229
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,840
Before we run the simulations though, we like to
break down each character's histories and

230
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:37,380
abilities before improvising a scenario on how we
imagine one of the 1,000 simulations would play

231
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:43,820
out, beat for beat. It is my turn to go first with the
DC characters backstory, so let me tell you all

232
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:52,020
about Elongated Dan. Randolph Relf Dibney was
born in Waymore, Nebraska to a modest and

233
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:57,260
unassuming family. From a young age, Relf was
captivated by carnival side shows featuring

234
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:03,380
contortionists who seemingly impossible feats
of flexibility ignited his imagination.

235
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:08,400
Determined to uncover their secrets, Relf
discovered that many of these performers drank a

236
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:15,460
soda called Gin Gold, which was flavored with
extract from a rare fruit known as Jingo, which

237
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:21,240
only grew in the remote jungles of the Yucatan
Peninsula in Mexico. As it turned out, most people

238
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:27,460
were allergic to Jingo in its raw concentrated
form, as it possessed unusual biochemical

239
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,380
properties that interacted with the human
nervous system. Fascinated, Relf studied

240
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:38,940
chemistry and eventually traveled to the Yucatan
to collect Jingo fruit samples. He isolated and

241
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:44,280
refined the active compound into a highly
concentrated extract, which upon ingesting

242
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:50,960
radically transformed Relf's body, triggering
within it a latent metagene that granted him

243
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,500
superhuman elasticity. He found he could
stretch, twist, and reshape himself into almost

244
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:02,660
any form imaginable. Inspired by the flash in
Central City and determined to use his newfound

245
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:09,740
gifts for good, Relf adopted the heroic identity
of Elongated Man. You can learn more about Flash in

246
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:15,560
our Flash vs. Quicksilver duel episode. Unique
among superheroes, Relf never concealed his

247
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:22,200
identity and instead embraced fame as a celebrity
detective. Early in his heroic journey, he met

248
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:28,680
Su-Dirban, a spirited and wealthy socialite. The
two married and quickly became one of the most

249
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:35,380
beloved and enduring couples in the superhero
community. As a close ally of the Flash, Relf

250
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:41,020
became an honored member of the Justice League of
America. Known for his trademark nose twitch

251
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:47,220
whenever something seemed to miss, Relf relished
solving mysteries and earned a reputation as one

252
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:51,760
of the world's greatest detectives. His
lighthearted nature, keen intellect, and

253
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:58,260
unwavering devotion to Su made him a respected
figure among both heroes and civilians. While

254
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:03,220
joining the Justice League on countless missions
together, Relf and Su traveled the globe solving

255
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,900
bizarre, supernatural, and otherworldly
mysteries. Though not the most physically

256
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:15,360
imposing hero, Relf's flexibility and deductive
genius often made him the key to resolving crises

257
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,660
that others couldn't. The couple became
mainstays in the Justice League Europe and later

258
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:26,440
joined the offbeat Super Buddies team formed by
Maxwell Lord. In addition to his work with

259
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:32,200
superhero teams, Relf became a liaison between
the mystical and scientific community. He

260
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,300
consulted on arcane-related investigations and
developed a working knowledge of magical

261
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:41,960
phenomena, which aided in several cases
involving cursed artifacts and

262
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:47,240
extra-dimensional incursions. His ability to
combine scientific reasoning with open-minded

263
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,700
intuition set him apart for more rigid
detectives. He and Su also developed a rapport

264
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:58,260
with many of their fellow heroes, forging close
ties with members of the Justice Society and newer

265
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:04,360
heroes alike. They were frequently called upon
for both mystery-solving expertise and moral

266
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:10,620
support, becoming regarded as a stabilizing
presence in the heroic community. Relf's humor

267
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:16,260
and Su's charm made them a welcome addition to
nearly any gathering. Their joyful partnership

268
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:21,860
came to a tragic end, however, when Su was found
murdered in their home. Investigations revealed

269
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:58,000
that years earlier, Ralph was shattered by the
loss. His grief consumed him, and he turned to

270
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,720
mysticism in a desperate attempt to resurrect
Sue. After finding Sue's tombstone defaced with a

271
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:09,040
Kryptonian symbol for resurrection, Ralph
tracked down the vandals and learned of the Cult of

272
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:15,100
Connor, an organization attempting to bring the
recently deceased Superboy back to life. You can

273
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:20,460
learn more about Superboy in his duel against
Rogue. The Cult planned to test the resurrection

274
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:27,060
technique by first attempting to bring back Sue.
Ralph, lost without his wife, joined their cause

275
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:32,940
and brought four other heroes to the ceremony.
Midway through, however, Ralph deduced it was an

276
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:39,800
elaborate hoax and tried to stop the ritual. As the
ceremonial building burned, the straw effigy of

277
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:46,220
Sue, now a flame, crawled toward him and whispered
his name. Devastated, Ralph believed he had

278
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:52,140
destroyed his only chance at reunion. Ralph
relocated to Marseille under the alias Alvin

279
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:57,120
Bergson, where he was eventually found by
Detective Chimp, who sought his deductive

280
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,540
expertise. You can learn more about Detective
Chimp in his duel against Howard the Duck. Ralph

281
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:08,440
joined Detective Chimp and his magical Shadow
Pact team in Egypt, where the Helmet of Nubu began

282
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:14,660
to speak to Ralph. Eventually, Ralph performed a
resurrection ritual in the Tower of Fate using the

283
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:20,480
Helmet of Nubu. After donning the helmet and
firing an enchanted gun at it, the illusion

284
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,680
shattered, revealing that the supervillain
Felix Faust had posed as Nubu, manipulating Ralph

285
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:32,780
with the intention to trade his soul to the demon
lord, Nieron. Ralph revealed, however, that he

286
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:38,240
had known the truth all along and that the ritual he
had performed was actually a binding spell.

287
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,660
Nieron appeared and killed Ralph, unaware the
spell would imprison both him and Faust in the

288
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:51,300
Tower. Reunited with his wife in the afterlife,
Ralph and Sue remained on the mortal plane as ghost

289
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:56,520
detectives, solving paranormal cases from
beyond the grave. In post-Flashpoint

290
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:01,020
continuity, Ralph was alive once again,
portrayed as a private investigator

291
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:06,580
specializing in metahuman cases, and who had
withdrawn from the public eye after Sue's

292
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:13,480
apparent death in a metahuman-related accident.
Isolated and emotionally fractured, he was also

293
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,780
physically unstable. His body's elasticity
deteriorated from exposure to corrupted

294
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:25,300
synthetic gingold used in unauthorized
experiments. Ralph's condition worsened until

295
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:31,600
he was found by Batman and the Flash who brought him
to Star Labs. There, a Medigine Regeneration

296
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:37,460
Chamber stabilized his molecules and restored
his powers. Grateful for his second chance, Ralph

297
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:44,000
resumed his role as elongated man. Operating
under the alias Big Shot, he infiltrated the

298
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,620
Seeker Six under the direction of the Riddler who
was manipulating the team under the codename

299
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:56,060
Mockingbird. Sue, who supposed death had been
fabricated as part of Ralph's cover story, was

300
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:01,080
later revealed to be alive. Upon reuniting, the
couple reconciled and resumed their

301
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,680
crime-solving partnership, continuing their
adventures together. Powers-wise, elongated

302
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:12,360
man possesses an elastic body which allows him to
stretch and reshape his physical form,

303
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:17,520
contorting into nearly any shape with
extraordinary precision. His elasticity also

304
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,940
provides him with enhanced durability and
resistance to physical trauma. He can flatten

305
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:29,100
himself, elongate his limbs, slip through narrow
spaces, and rebound from impacts that would

306
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:35,920
incapacitate normal humans. His flexibility is
matched by his brilliant deductive mind. He is a

307
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:41,880
world-class detective whose keen instincts and
analytical skills rival the best investigators

308
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:48,860
on earth. And that's elongated man. Elongated man
is probably, I think, an underrated character,

309
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:56,520
but with the worst damn origin story in existence.
He basically drank fruit juice and became

310
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:01,580
stretchy. Hey man, it was the Silver Age! What are
you gonna do? Silver Age doesn't cut it. Like, that

311
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:07,540
sounds more like a Golden Age-type origin story.
So even saying it's the Silver Age is just sad. Out

312
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:12,020
of all the origin stories we've discussed on this
podcast, that's the worst one. And probably will

313
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:18,620
remain the worst one. At the very least, it's
unique, alright? Fruit juice? Come on! Inhuman

314
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:23,100
origins? Way better, you know? The whole
backstory with the Kree experimentation on early

315
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:28,760
humans, special genes that give them powers when
they're exposed to an alien element. That's how

316
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:35,760
you do a Silver Age origin story right there. But
you know what's more realistic? Fruit juice! Let

317
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:42,280
me get into Medusa's backstory. In the hidden city
of Adelene, Medusa-Litha-Melaquin was born into

318
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:47,960
the Inhuman Royal Family, the daughter of Quillen
and Ember, and sister to Crystal. When she was an

319
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:53,480
infant, her parents exposed her to the Tarogen
Mist, the mutagenic vapor that unlocks late

320
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:58,640
in-inhuman traits, which granted her prehensile
crimson hair able to lift great weights,

321
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,680
lash-like whips, and move with the dexterity of
added limbs. You can learn more about Tarogenesis

322
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:09,200
and the history of the Inhumans in our Shazam vs
Blackbolt dual episode. During adolescence,

323
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,880
Medusa regularly visited her distant cousin
Blackbolt, who was confined in an isolation

324
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,220
chamber because a whisper from his voice could
level mountains. They invented a private sign

325
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:24,000
language, shared secret conversations through
the glass, and fell in love. Soon after

326
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,780
Blackbolt's 18th birthday, his parents were
accidentally killed when his voice destroyed

327
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:32,600
their spacecraft. The tragedy placed the young
man on the throne, with Medusa publicly

328
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,220
acknowledged as his betrothed. Early in
Blackbolt's reign, the Alpha Primitives,

329
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:42,480
Adelene's genetically engineered labor cast,
rebelled. Maximus, Blackbolt's unstable

330
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,240
younger brother, exposed three Alpha Primitives
to experimental Tarogen energy, mutating them

331
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:54,140
into monstrous beings called the Tricon. Medusa
battled the trio from a sky sled, but the craft

332
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:59,440
crashed, and the impact left her an amnesiac
wanderer. She drifted through Europe, where she

333
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,640
was discovered by the villain, Wizard, who
recruited Medusa into his frightful four team.

334
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:09,020
Wizard's mind-altering devices kept her
obedient while she fought the Fantastic Four on

335
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:14,360
several occasions. Eventually, Medusa's
cousin, the Inhuman Warrior Gorgon, arrived on

336
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,280
Earth to retrieve her. Medusa was returned to
Adelene, where the shock of familiar

337
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:24,280
surroundings restored her memory. During her
absence, Maximus had seized the throne and

338
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:29,360
declared Medusa his future queen. He sealed the
city inside an energy dome generated from

339
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:34,200
negative zone particles. Blackbolt used his
devastating voice to shatter the barrier,

340
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,000
freeing the Inhumans but leveling large portions
of their capital. With Adelene's secrets now

341
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,640
exposed, the royal family undertook a diplomatic
mission among humans. In New York, Medusa was

342
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,640
manipulated into battling Spiderman, and the
Wizard briefly recaptured her before she escaped

343
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:55,120
again. Medusa soon forged friendlier ties with
humanity. When Susan Richards left the Fantastic

344
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,820
Four, Medusa filled her vacancy, fighting
threats on Earth and in deep space attending

345
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,540
Crystal's marriage to the speedster
Quicksilver. You can learn more about the

346
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,820
Fantastic Four in their duel against the Justice
Society and more about Quicksilver in his duel

347
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:12,620
against the Flash. After Susan Richards returned
to the Fantastic Four, Medusa rejoined Blackbolt

348
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:17,040
and guided Adelene through environmental
crises. Earth's pollution threatened in human

349
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,949
biology, so the city was relocated to the
oxygen-rich blue area on the moon. There,

350
00:34:22,949 --> 00:34:28,020
Blackbolt and Medusa married, formalizing her
position as queen consort and royal interpreter.

351
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:33,100
A new conflict flared when Medusa became
pregnant. The genetics council ruled the fetus

352
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:37,889
too dangerous, fearing it might combine
Maximus's madness with Blackbolt's power and

353
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:43,679
ordered termination. Defying them, Medusa fled
to Earth's deserts and gave birth in secrecy to

354
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,100
Ahura. Returning under truce, she surrendered
the infant for study, unaware the council planned

355
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:54,600
to trade him to human scientists for Earth
technology. The transport crashed, Ahura

356
00:34:54,600 --> 00:35:00,960
vanished and Medusa sank into depression. Years
later, the boy, aged rapidly by his genetics, was

357
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,350
recovered, declared unstable, and imprisoned in
solitary confinement, much as his father once had

358
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:11,200
been. Public outrage over the council's
duplicity forced both council and royal family to

359
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,060
advocate Adelene, but political chaos soon
demanded the royals resume their leadership,

360
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:20,280
still headquartered on the moon. When most of the
Earth's mutants were stripped of their powers by

361
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,320
the Scarlet Witch's magic, Crystal's ex-husband
Quicksilver, stripped of his mutant speed,

362
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:30,280
sought asylum in Adelene. Medusa granted refuge
before bait him from entering the Tarjan

363
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:36,240
Chambers. Quicksilver defied her, stole Tarjan
crystals, and fled. In the ensuing turmoil,

364
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,320
Blackbolt snapped at Medusa for misinterpreting
his silent orders before the council, and Maximus

365
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:46,780
exploited their marital strain by psychically
darkening Medusa's thoughts. Confused, she

366
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:51,140
visited Maximus in a cell, and under his
influence, they shared a single kiss that

367
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,890
Blackbolt witnessed in anguish. Not long after
the royal family learned Blackbolt had been

368
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:01,680
replaced by a scroll, a shapeshifting alien
infiltrator. Medusa led an assault into galactic

369
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:06,140
territory controlled by the Kree Empire,
bargaining her sister Crystal's hand in marriage

370
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:11,580
to the Kree leader Ronin in exchange for aid,
rescuing Blackbolt and Ahura. You can learn more

371
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:17,200
about Ronin in his dual episode against Big Barda.
Upon their return, Maximus had fortified Adelene

372
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,740
and converted the city into a starship. The
Inhumans launched a campaign that routed the

373
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:26,950
scrolls, and, after fierce clashes with the Shiar
Empire, left Blackbolt and the Shiar ruler

374
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:33,180
apparently dead in a doomsday blast. Medusa,
weeping yet resolute, declared victory against

375
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:39,820
the Shiar, and assumed sole rule of both Inhumans
and the newly conquered Kree. As queen, she

376
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:45,360
quelled riots incited by outside agitators and
secretly staged a faux rebellion engineered by

377
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:51,500
Maximus to prove the royal family's necessity,
defeating it publicly to consolidate authority.

378
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:56,320
During this period, she represented the Inhumans
on the Illuminati, a clandestine council of

379
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,200
Earth's foremost strategists. Despite those
successes, disaster struck when Blackbolt

380
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:07,080
detonated a pterogen device while repelling an
attack on Adelene by Thanos. The Inhuman City was

381
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:11,860
obliterated and a miscarrying pterogen
particles drifted across Earth, awakening

382
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:17,700
dormant Inhuman genes amongst some humans,
creating new humans. Medusa established new

383
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:22,720
Adelene at the mouth of the Hudson River, welcomed
the royal family's newly empowered subjects, and

384
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:27,890
defeated rogue new human factions. She assisted
Blackbolt in saving their son Ahura from the

385
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:32,760
time-manipulator Kang the Conqueror and guided
him home. You can learn more about Kang in his duel

386
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,980
against Professor Zoom. Elsewhere, scientists
discovered that lingering pterogen clouds were

387
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:43,480
poisonous to mutants, igniting global tension.
Medusa pursued diplomacy, but hostilities

388
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:48,310
escalated. Confronted with the looming
extinction of mutants, she chose to destroy the

389
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:52,680
last pterogen cloud. The decision sacrificed her
people's future ability to undergo

390
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:57,720
pterogenesis, but it averted worldwide
disaster. Medusa abdicated the throne and

391
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:03,930
appointed the engineer Iso to guide Adelene under
a more democratic charter. No longer monarchs,

392
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:09,140
Medusa and Blackbolt led an exploratory mission
to the ruined alien Kree world of Hala. Their outer

393
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:14,320
space expedition led them to an ancient substance
called Primogen, the source of all pterogen

394
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:19,200
guarded by the cosmic gardeners known as the
progenitors. During the voyage, Medusa and

395
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,360
Blackbolt reconciled emotionally, agreeing to
stand as partners, but not lovers. The pair

396
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:29,360
eventually returned to Adelene, their long
severed bond rekindled once more, as I said about

397
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:34,960
rebuilding their people's future yet again. And
that's Medusa's backstory powers-wise. Medusa

398
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,120
has the enhanced physiology of an inhuman granted
to her through pterogenesis. This includes

399
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:45,890
greater strength, speed, and durability than any
normal human. She also has trichokinesis, or the

400
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:51,320
ability to psionically control every strand of
her hair, each one having tensile strength and

401
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:57,720
durability of an iron wire. With her hair, she can
lift over one and a half tons and she can move it in

402
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:02,700
any manner imaginable from performing delicate
tasks like threading a needle, creating powerful

403
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:08,540
whips, or ensnaring opponents. She cannot detect
pain through her hair, but she can feel sensations

404
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:14,720
through her psionic connection to its strands.
Finally, Medusa is a skilled diplomat and an

405
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:21,820
experienced fighter. And that's Medusa. I have to
say, elongated man may have kind of a silly origin,

406
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:30,520
but at least the guy did not marry his cousin. Oh
dang, what is this, Game of Thrones? Kinda. I mean,

407
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:35,950
they're distant cousins, alright? I don't know
how far removed they are, but uh, yeah, that

408
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:39,660
thing's kind of common I guess within royalty.
That's a pretty good description though. At their

409
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:45,520
best, the inhumans kind of feel like a sci-fi Game
of Thrones. That inhuman show should have been so

410
00:39:45,520 --> 00:40:44,060
much better. So much better, I know, right? But now
that we've got the characters' histories and

411
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:49,450
abilities out of the way, let's speculate on how
one of the 1000 simulated matches will go. The

412
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:53,900
winners determined by our simulations not our
speculation, but it's fun to imagine how the fight

413
00:40:53,900 --> 00:41:26,310
could play out. AGA9K, what are the rules of our
speculation? Alright, then let's get into it.

414
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:32,400
Elongated man and Medusa meet on the battlefield?
Who goes first? I'm gonna say that elongated man

415
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:39,320
starts with his nose twitching, probably, as he
tries to make sense of this new foe before him.

416
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:47,140
Okay, while elongated man is busy twitching his
nose, Medusa extends her hair downward and uses

417
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:52,220
her hair like legs to race toward elongated man
moving across the floor, kind of like a Mustang or

418
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:59,080
something, and she uses some of her hair to wrap him
up and crush him in her hair grasp. She tries at

419
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:06,060
least because elongated man, he's gonna inflate
his body like a balloon to escape her grasp and he's

420
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:12,180
gonna quickly contract his body, then stretch his
legs to double kick her right in the gut. Well,

421
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:18,080
Medusa blocks the double kick because she's gonna
form some of her hair into a shield, right, and her

422
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:23,960
hair is super durable, so the hair blocks the
attack and then her hair grabs his legs and she also

423
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,200
grabs his arms with other strands of hair and she's
gonna stretch elongated man out just like Taffy

424
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:35,740
until he snaps. Alright, well as she continues to
stretch him and find out that his limit is really

425
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:40,740
long, that's when he's gonna shoot his head
forward, you know, stretching his neck to

426
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:46,820
headbutt her right in the face and just blinding
her from the pain. That was a pretty good move.

427
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:51,660
Okay, so that's probably gonna hurt her, she drops
his legs and arms, but she's durable, you know,

428
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:57,820
she's an inhuman, but she's also royally pissed,
okay, so she forms some of her hair into a sharp like

429
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:03,240
spearhead and kind of like a scorpion tail, she
strikes forward with it and stabs through

430
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:08,740
elongated man's chest. Damn, okay, well
elongated man, he's essentially immune to blunt

431
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:15,430
physical force, but he can be pierced or stabbed by
sharpen of objects, but not this time. I'm gonna

432
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:21,930
say as soon as he feels the initial poke, he's gonna
stretch his chest backward to compensate. And

433
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:29,390
while she's trying to stab essentially putty,
elongated man is gonna stretch himself really

434
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:36,600
wide covering Medusa and all of her hair in like a
giant tarp essentially made of his body. And

435
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:42,000
that's gonna suffocate her beneath him. Couldn't
she just stab him repeatedly with her hair from

436
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:50,800
under that tarp with like a thousand hair needles?
That's just acupuncture, you know. If anything,

437
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:57,860
you know, she blocks his chi or some shit. All
right, okay, well then she turns her hair into like

438
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:03,770
spinning fan blades, which I started doing the
comics once. So she fills this elongated man tarp

439
00:44:03,770 --> 00:44:09,740
with air, which is gonna cause him to rise and lift
off of her like a sheet in the wind. And he doesn't

440
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:15,660
want to get blown away, so he shrinks back down to
normal size. And at that point, Medusa lashes him

441
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:21,080
with hundreds of hair whips, just like loud
cracking all over his body, like just like

442
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:28,440
firecrackers. And he gets whipped to death
basically. Oh, damn. Okay, well, he's going to

443
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:36,380
expand the size of one of his hands to act as a
barrier between his body and her whips. And sure,

444
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:43,140
that probably means he's whinsing by how much his
hand hurts, but he'll live. And it's going to give

445
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:50,080
him enough time to grow his other hand to giant size
and have it reach over his barrier to slam down on

446
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:56,460
top of Medusa, squashing her into the ground like
whack a mole. All right, okay, so she's like in a

447
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,940
hole in the ground, but she's going to come out of
the hole unscathed because at the very last

448
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:07,780
second, she used her hair to wrap around her entire
body and form like a hair armor, like a hair suit of

449
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:14,700
armor type thing. And as she comes out, she lassos
out a strand that wraps around elongated man's

450
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:19,860
neck and she tightens it just grotting him to
death, like either causing him to die from

451
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:26,480
strangulation, or like even if he can stretch his
neck and trachea thin enough to still breathe,

452
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:32,400
she's going to tighten it even more just to take his
head completely off. Match over. Dude, elongated

453
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:38,500
man, as he's being grotted, I'm going to say he
quickly stretches his fingers down and around

454
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:44,980
Medusa. So they approach her from behind out of her
line of sight, and the fingers are going to plunge

455
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:50,900
into her ears, making their way past her skull to
her brain, and it's just going to squeeze it to

456
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:57,140
death essentially. So she dies before he gets
strangled and now the match is really over. All

457
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:02,480
right, well, that seems like a good place to end the
match. So either elongated man gets garotted by

458
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:09,000
Medusa's hair, or he squeezes her brain by
entering her skull through the ear canal. Let's go

459
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,840
ahead and run the simulations and find out which of
these two scenarios ends up happening by coming

460
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:21,600
back with a winner. AG9K, hit it! Inputting data,
running calculations, processing results,

461
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:27,500
simulations complete. All right, I liked this
matchup. I wasn't quite sure how it would go. I was

462
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:33,060
hoping it wouldn't be too much like our Plastic Man
vs. Mr. Fantastic dual episode, but I thought this

463
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:38,840
would be neat because it's really a stretchy guy
versus a woman who makes her hair stretch, and I was

464
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:44,380
wondering how that would affect the stats, right?
Because in some ways, Medusa stretching her hair

465
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:49,780
gives her an advantage, because it's not really
her making herself vulnerable, it's just her

466
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:54,840
hair, right? So she has pretty damn good
evasiveness, although elongated man, of course,

467
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:00,800
is really damn evasive himself. Right, we did say
that elongated man is faster than Medusa, just

468
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:07,360
because of the nature of his powers, and he's an
ally of Flash who he's been able to keep up with.

469
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:13,360
Yeah, he can stretch his legs like hundreds of feet
and make huge strides, whereas Medusa can't

470
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:18,360
quite, it doesn't really do that to the same
effect. We also said that elongated man was more

471
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:24,360
durable considering how malleable his body is.
Yeah, Medusa is durable if she gets hit, but she

472
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:30,600
herself is not malleable, it's her hair. So in
terms of using her hair defensively, we put those

473
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:35,980
types of moves in the evasiveness category as
opposed to durability. And the only other stat

474
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:41,280
category where elongated man came out on top was
intellect, considering he's an incredibly

475
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:47,800
intelligent and deductive thinker, but Medusa
was not only more versatile, but also had a greater

476
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,100
damage potential, surprisingly. Oh yeah, her
hair is really strong, I've seen her knock around

477
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:56,820
characters like Thing and Iron Man with her hair.
We also interestingly said that Medusa had

478
00:47:56,820 --> 00:48:04,220
greater perception because of her connection to
her hair. Yeah, she has psionic feelers with her

479
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:09,380
hair essentially. So taking all of these stats
into consideration, Joseph, who do you think came

480
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:15,940
out on top? I don't know, I'm gonna say Medusa, I
think it's gonna be close though. Big surprise,

481
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:20,980
biased. Is it though? Is it a surprise that I would
guess the Marvel character? Because I don't think

482
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:28,680
so. What is a surprise is how many of our Instagram
followers that voted in our poll that we put up

483
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:34,960
chose elongated man as the likely winner, because
he got 63% of the votes. Now both of these

484
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:41,160
characters, I would say are pretty obscure,
potentially, though Medusa is probably more

485
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:46,840
obscure than elongated man, and that's why I think
he got the edge in the poll. I wouldn't know how to

486
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:54,940
quantify that, but maybe we just did. Well, let's
find out who won. AJ9K, the results please.

487
00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:08,160
Alright, the winner between elongated man and
Medusa is Medusa. Yes, but it was so close. Medusa

488
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:19,600
won 514 of the 1000 matches, or 51.4%, compared to
elongated man, who only won 486 of his matches.

489
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:24,800
It's a coin toss, pretty much. I wonder what put
Medusa over the edge, I bet you it was probably her

490
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:30,400
inhuman physiology. Well, actually it was her
damage. Okay, so her inhuman powers then. Which

491
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,460
makes sense, I mean like her hair can perform a lot
of the same feats that elongated man stretching

492
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:40,770
can, but I think her hair is a whole lot more durable
and strong than elongated man's body. Well,

493
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:45,740
considering it's like iron fibers, yeah, you
could probably make that argument. But that

494
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:50,360
particular stat being that much higher than
elongated man doesn't surprise me, considering

495
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:57,270
her ranking within the inhuman royal family. Like
the royal family tends to be amongst the most

496
00:49:57,270 --> 00:50:03,520
powerful inhumans. That's true. So for her to be
queen means that she could basically take on

497
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:10,020
almost any other inhuman, right? Blackbolt is
just insanely powerful, so I don't know. I mean,

498
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:15,440
she's shut him up a few times with her hair, so it's
hard to say. It all depends on, you know, how the

499
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:20,060
story's being written. We could run the stats, who
knows. Wait, you're saying she's blocked his

500
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:27,620
speech with her hair? She kept his jaw closed so he
couldn't speak. Gotcha. Okay. Wow. Well, I gotta

501
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:33,300
say, I'm not surprised that this match was this
close. I assumed it was going to be this close. It's

502
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:37,020
always nice when the matches are close like this,
because it means it was just a good pairing. And

503
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:41,700
when I lose, I think it just means that Jonathan has
to respect the Marvel character even more when

504
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:47,270
it's close. That being said, I don't have to
respect any DC character, Marvel wins. So

505
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:52,720
elongated man could take his dumb nose twitching,
ginkgo biloba, take an ass, and get the hell out of

506
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:57,340
here. Well, you know what? At the end of the day,
elongated man gets to go home to a beautiful wife

507
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:04,860
who I'm sure is very satisfied by him in multiple
ways. And therefore he's the true winner. I was

508
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:10,220
wondering when you were going to go for the dick
joke. Elongated man is just, it's just the worst

509
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:14,400
name, the character with the worst name and the
worst origin. There's actually a panel in the

510
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,640
comics where elongated man is like, I love my wife
because she's been around guys like Superman, it

511
00:51:19,640 --> 00:51:26,720
still loves me. And I'm like, we all know why. That
does it for this dual guys. AJ and IK help close this

512
00:51:26,720 --> 00:52:00,440
out. Max Destruction, Senjoh World, and Console
Combat. In our next episode, we are doing another

513
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:07,920
dual this time between the insanely powerful
characters, Mr. Mxyz Spitalik, and Impossible

514
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,680
Man. But that does it for this episode. We want to
give a big thanks to our executive producers, John
