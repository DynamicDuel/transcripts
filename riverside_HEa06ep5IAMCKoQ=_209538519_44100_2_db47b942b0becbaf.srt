2
00:00:23,342 --> 00:00:27,723
Welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:27,763 --> 00:00:33,206
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:33,646 --> 00:00:38,608
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous
Joe. And in this episode, it's a duel episode

5
00:00:38,628 --> 00:00:43,770
where we're pitting Sinestro against Magneto.
And of course, this ties into our Dark Phoenix

6
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:48,152
review from our last episode. Right, yeah. I'm
really looking forward to see who'd win in

7
00:00:48,172 --> 00:00:53,022
this match because they're both insanely powerful
villains who have like really... compelling

8
00:00:53,082 --> 00:00:57,626
character arcs from the comics. I know some
people were expecting us to pit Magneto against

9
00:00:58,106 --> 00:01:02,169
Dr. Polaris, I think his name is, but those
guys are so similar that I feel like it wouldn't

10
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:05,672
be an interesting fight because what you'd end
up getting is like a Hawkeye versus Green Arrow

11
00:01:05,712 --> 00:01:10,216
situation where the characters are identical
and the match ends up being like a coin toss.

12
00:01:10,396 --> 00:01:14,600
Yeah, that's so fun. This is going to be much
more interesting. Yeah, because it's characters

13
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,783
with similar power levels, but with different
power sets all together. Yeah, we'll get into

14
00:01:18,823 --> 00:01:22,126
more of why we think this is a good matchup
later on in the episode. Before that, we're

15
00:01:22,146 --> 00:01:26,928
going to break down the news items from the
past week, of which there is not much news.

16
00:01:26,968 --> 00:01:31,810
No, kind of slow. Yeah, Lobo is getting his
own spinoff show on the Syfy channel from Krypton,

17
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,632
which is also on that channel. And the Avengers
are getting their own video game. Yeah, we

18
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:40,994
don't usually comment on video game news, but
I feel like this is a big thing to talk about.

19
00:01:41,014 --> 00:01:45,235
It was a pretty decent trailer, so there is
a big lead up to it for sure. I think it just

20
00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:50,137
kind of disappointed everyone. What? Really?
I guess that's the word on the street, huh?

21
00:01:50,217 --> 00:01:54,719
Yeah. We'll get into it. Yeah. But as always,
our segment times are in our episode description.

22
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:58,881
So feel free to jump right to whatever topic
you want to listen to. Right before we get

23
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:02,963
into the news, we want to give a big, huge shout
out to those who have rated us and reviewed

24
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:08,085
us on the Apple Podcasts platform. As you know,
we're trying to get to 200 reviews because

25
00:02:08,105 --> 00:02:12,287
at that point we become eligible to become critics
on Rotten Tomatoes and have our reviews of

26
00:02:12,307 --> 00:02:16,789
the Marvel and DC movies count toward those
films official tomato meter. Yeah, we don't

27
00:02:16,809 --> 00:02:21,775
have any new ratings. We're still at 110. but
we do have a few bladed shout outs to people

28
00:02:21,795 --> 00:02:26,639
who have given us reviews. Yeah, we want to
give thanks to NRA 413 for leaving us a review,

29
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:32,162
as well as Circus Loving and his sons, Harry
and Tasker. You guys get a special shout out.

30
00:02:32,483 --> 00:02:36,745
Typically, we say that this show is geared toward
adults because of the language that we just

31
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:42,369
can't help ourselves from saying. It's so hard.
Kids know these words nowadays, right? They

32
00:02:42,389 --> 00:02:47,564
should it. It's not what Superman would do.
This episode for you, Harry and Tess, I'm going

33
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:51,387
to try my hardest not to say any swear words.
Yep, this is for you, too. It's going to be

34
00:02:51,407 --> 00:02:54,909
especially hard considering that this is a dual
episode. Yeah, it's always when I get the most

35
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:58,851
frustrated. So it's going to be a huge challenge.
Yeah. Instead of the F word, I'm going to say

36
00:02:58,951 --> 00:03:05,815
Frick. And instead of the A hole word, I'm going
to say butthole. And instead of the S word,

37
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:11,836
I'm going to say snap. Oh, snap. Exactly. So
yeah, thank you guys for leaving us reviews

38
00:03:11,856 --> 00:03:16,472
again. And remember Harry and Tasker, Marvel
is better. What? They don't cook to the no

39
00:03:16,512 --> 00:03:23,167
prize. A No Prize is an award Marvel used to
give out up until the 90s to fans. Our version,

40
00:03:23,247 --> 00:03:27,849
the dynamic duel No Prize, is a digital award
that we post on social media that Jonathan

41
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:31,831
personally draws for those who we feel gave
the best answer to our question of the week.

42
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:36,333
Last week's question was in regards to the news
that the DC Universe app might be going under.

43
00:03:36,753 --> 00:03:42,095
Yeah, it was. Would you prefer to have a DC
Universe app subscription or a WarnerMedia

44
00:03:42,215 --> 00:03:47,737
app subscription that only has some DC content?
The television stuff, not the comic books.

45
00:03:47,998 --> 00:03:52,620
Right. We got a lot of answers, a lot of great
answers. Yeah. Honorable mention goes to Jace

46
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,243
Crump for his answer that he would prefer to
just have the WarnerMedia app because it has

47
00:03:57,343 --> 00:04:02,045
more content than the DC app and would have
a bigger audience. Iranagami gave the answer

48
00:04:02,145 --> 00:04:07,628
DC Universe because he enjoys the apps, comic
libraries and animated shows, provided that

49
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:12,611
the quality is better than the CW. Honorable
mention goes to Dustin Balcom, who said he'd

50
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:16,353
prefer to have the DC Universe app because it
pays for itself. If you just read four to five

51
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:20,559
comics a month, And plus it has those extra
shows. Jeremy Orr said that he would prefer

52
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,042
the Warner Media app because it has a larger
audience pool and therefore the price can stay

53
00:04:25,122 --> 00:04:30,365
low. Plus getting anime and other great content
is just awesome. Honorable mention goes to

54
00:04:30,405 --> 00:04:35,067
James Cole III who prefers the DC Universe app
because it has fantastic original content,

55
00:04:35,327 --> 00:04:40,130
over 22,000 digital comics on all your devices
and television. It sounds like an advertisement.

56
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,973
I think James Cole III works for DC Universe.
I'm sold. Joel Seagrave also gave the answer

57
00:04:46,013 --> 00:04:51,257
DC Universe. But he would prefer it to be on
the PS4 and he feels that a Warner Media app

58
00:04:51,337 --> 00:04:55,461
would be too expensive. Honorable mention goes
to Jonathan Hazelton who said he would prefer

59
00:04:55,481 --> 00:04:59,665
subscribing to the DC Universe app because he
doubts that there will be comics on the Warner

60
00:04:59,705 --> 00:05:04,569
Media app. Ken Johnson also said he wants the
DC Universe app. There's so many DC Universe

61
00:05:04,649 --> 00:05:08,552
app people here. I know, right? I'm like really
happy about that. There's so many DC fans.

62
00:05:08,573 --> 00:05:12,456
It's so weird. Yeah, it's awesome. I didn't
think any of them existed. So amazing. Ken

63
00:05:12,476 --> 00:05:17,172
Johnson wants the DC Universe app. But he wants
them to open up all of the DC film and television

64
00:05:17,212 --> 00:05:21,716
content instead of, you know, just putting out
different things each month. And also he wants

65
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:27,621
all of the episodes for the television shows
to be released at once. That's a huge aspect

66
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:32,546
to why I think the DC universe is not as successful
as it could be. I agree. If I could binge Swamp

67
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:37,250
Thing like in one weekend, I would much prefer
that to having to wait, you know, 10 weeks,

68
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:41,313
especially because I know it's not going to
continue. So like, what's the incentive? Right.

69
00:05:41,626 --> 00:05:45,169
Exactly and the hype's all gonna die by the
time the show ends. Right. Anyway, honorable

70
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:49,013
mention also goes to Jeremy Hoyt, who said he
would prefer the DC Universe app because he

71
00:05:49,053 --> 00:05:54,158
wants access to all DC content, including that
terrible Green Lantern movie. What? Which I

72
00:05:54,198 --> 00:06:00,444
think makes sense. The final honorable mention
goes to Caleb Elbers, who said that he only

73
00:06:00,484 --> 00:06:05,389
wants content that's good and therefore wants
a dynamic dual streaming service with film

74
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:10,635
commentaries. and shorts of the duels. Yes,
I would totally pay for that. Like animated

75
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:14,377
shorts of the duels? Yeah. Or even live action.
Even live action. They do that with the Bat

76
00:06:14,397 --> 00:06:17,858
in the Sun productions. What is that called?
Like superhero showdown or something like that.

77
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:21,900
That's right, that's right. Shut up and take
my money. I would totally pay for that. That

78
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,222
was a very flattering answer. Flattery will
get you everywhere. But it won't give you the

79
00:06:25,262 --> 00:06:29,463
no prize this time for some reason. Because
as cool as a dynamic duel streaming app would

80
00:06:29,503 --> 00:06:35,478
be, I don't think it would be nearly as cool
as Gaby Mai's answer who said, they would prefer

81
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:42,561
the DC Universe app, but only with DC Universe
Online, the game, and other DC games. I didn't

82
00:06:42,581 --> 00:06:47,464
even think about that. DC has so many great
video games. So he wants the app to have the

83
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:52,306
comics and the television shows and the movies
and the video games. Yes. I think a lot of

84
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:55,748
people would switch to the DC Universe app if
it came with those games too. Yeah, like the

85
00:06:55,768 --> 00:07:00,935
Batman Arkham games? Absolutely. Yeah, yeah.
Congrats again to Gavi Mai for your answer

86
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:04,757
this week. You win the no prize. And if you,
the listener, want to win your own no prize,

87
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:08,919
go ahead and stay tuned to later on this episode
when we will be asking another question of

88
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:11,921
the week. With that all out of the way, onto
the news.

89
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:24,100
Okay, so last week, like just hours before his
debut on the Krypton season two opener, Syfy

90
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:30,483
announced that Lobo will be getting his own
spin-off show. Is it gonna be like TVMA? Oh,

91
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:35,285
I hope so. I hope so, why not? It's Syfy channel.
I think they could do TVMA content on there.

92
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:39,667
If they don't, Lobo should be the first one.
Now I haven't actually seen the episode because

93
00:07:39,707 --> 00:07:45,149
I don't have the Syfy channel, but I have seen
clips from the episode and he just looks ruthless,

94
00:07:45,389 --> 00:07:49,655
man. He looks like he's gonna be a really good
Lobo. Really? And I love the character of Lobo.

95
00:07:49,715 --> 00:07:53,557
Like I still remember getting really excited
when they said that Danny Trejo was gonna be

96
00:07:53,617 --> 00:07:58,739
Lobo on the Flash television series. What? Yeah,
that ended up not happening. Really? But it

97
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:03,041
would have been so perfect. Is this the first
live action version of Lobo that we've seen?

98
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:07,723
Yes. Yeah. Wow. He looks a lot like the character.
It's pretty well done. Yeah. I've always thought

99
00:08:07,743 --> 00:08:12,064
he was kind of a crazy character, kind of in
the same vein of like Deadpool and how wacky

100
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:16,951
and inappropriate he is, how like un-kid friendly,
you know? He's a great character for Harry

101
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:22,375
and Tasker, you know Because he doesn't say
cuss words, you know, he instead of the f-word

102
00:08:22,415 --> 00:08:27,719
He says frag and he says like bastitch a fast
itch. Yeah, those are safe curse words, right?

103
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:34,203
I guess I they don't sound like it but you know
Technically, that's true. I guess the show

104
00:08:34,243 --> 00:08:39,187
is gonna be written and produced by Krypton's
same showrunner Cameron Welsh I've only seen

105
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:44,555
like the first four episodes of Krypton and
it was fine Like, I'm still not too invested

106
00:08:44,995 --> 00:08:50,098
in the story of Superman's grandfather. Yeah.
But, like, the production value is decent.

107
00:08:50,218 --> 00:08:53,881
Well, it's kind of like Gotham, where in that
show, all these Batman villains are popping

108
00:08:53,921 --> 00:08:58,804
up, like, prematurely. Yeah. In the Batman universe.
Right. And in this one, it's like all Superman's

109
00:08:58,824 --> 00:09:02,887
villains are popping up prematurely in the Superman
universe. But it's guys like Brainiac, you

110
00:09:02,907 --> 00:09:07,811
know, who, of course, they were around before
Superman. Uh-huh. So. And Doomsday was too,

111
00:09:07,871 --> 00:09:11,633
I guess. Yeah. Can you tell us a little bit
about Lobo, for those who might not know about

112
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:16,147
him? Well, he was a character created in the
80s, which makes sense. I think he started

113
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:21,468
off as like a minor villain for the Omega Men.
He was a space biker. Yeah, right. He's like

114
00:09:21,548 --> 00:09:27,610
Deadpool, but like cranked up to 11. Deadpool
mixed with the Ghost Rider. Yeah, kinda. I

115
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,671
guess you could do that. He's the last of his
race. He like accidentally killed everyone

116
00:09:31,751 --> 00:09:37,033
else on his planet when he was like just a boy
with like a science experiment. It's pretty

117
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:43,199
wild. He's meant to be like an over the top
character. and he's insanely strong, like Superman

118
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:46,820
level strong. Who do you think we could pit
against him in a duel episode? We've already

119
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:51,042
used Ghost Rider against Etrigan and we've already
used Deadpool against Deathstroke. Yeah, I

120
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:54,743
don't think those would be good matches anyway.
Really? I don't know, Marvel, you tell me who

121
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:59,305
would be a good match. Maybe like the Silver
Surfer, although I want to pit him against

122
00:09:59,405 --> 00:10:03,687
Orion. Yeah. So I don't know, someone like Beta
Ray Bill or something, some crazy eighties

123
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:06,928
alien like that. I don't know, I'll have to
think about it. Okay, yeah, we should definitely

124
00:10:06,988 --> 00:10:12,262
do a duel episode with Lobo, maybe next year.
There's no release date for when his show will

125
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:16,604
be out. It might still be a few years away.
We'll do a dual episode with him soon. Cool.

126
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:21,526
Moving on to video game news, we got a trailer
for Marvel's Avengers video game that's coming

127
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:26,388
out. It was shown at E3 this past week. And
you know what? I feel like it's getting a lot

128
00:10:26,428 --> 00:10:30,310
of hate out there, but I didn't mind it. I hate
it. I think a lot of people are expecting maybe

129
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:35,732
different gameplay, maybe something like open
world. Yeah. Like Arkham. It's freaking 2019.

130
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:42,187
I almost said the bad word. It's 2019. It's
like, come on. This game does appear to be

131
00:10:42,247 --> 00:10:46,490
more mission-based than anything else. Right.
And I also noticed that the character design

132
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:51,114
was getting a lot of flack because the characters
don't resemble the movie counterparts. Which

133
00:10:51,194 --> 00:10:55,797
is fine. Like the movie counterparts don't look
exactly like the comic characters. Right, and

134
00:10:55,837 --> 00:11:00,761
it's not a movie-based game. So I don't mind
that the likenesses are different. What bothers

135
00:11:00,881 --> 00:11:06,225
me is not so much the likenesses, but the graphics
quality. It looks like something that could

136
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:11,964
have been on the GameCube. Yeah, these actors
faces are a little bit uncanny valley-y. Absolutely.

137
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:15,667
They're a little bit frightening, honestly.
Especially Tony Stark. I don't know why. And

138
00:11:15,687 --> 00:11:20,951
the writing. The writing just seems so generic.
It is really bad. OK, really bad. Let's start

139
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:26,675
from the beginning, though. So we get narration
from whom I'm assuming is Kamala Khan, because

140
00:11:26,695 --> 00:11:31,638
this seems like her voice style. And Kamala
Khan, of course, is Ms. Marvel. And it sounds

141
00:11:31,658 --> 00:11:35,441
like she's meeting the Avengers on this big
event known as A Day, where they're celebrating

142
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:39,844
the team. But. I guess there's some kind of
attack on San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge.

143
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:44,948
So Cap sends the team out and the action looks
super cinematic. I think it looks pretty damn

144
00:11:44,988 --> 00:11:49,951
cool. All the footage used in this trailer was
in game footage using the game's engine, but

145
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:54,075
it wasn't gameplay footage. I think some of
it was some of the behind the back stuff. I

146
00:11:54,355 --> 00:11:57,677
really think some of it was gameplay footage,
although we don't know what the gameplay necessarily

147
00:11:57,697 --> 00:12:01,000
is going to be like. If these are just like
quick time events or if those characters are

148
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,582
actually being controlled at this point, you
know, right, right. The Spider-Man video game

149
00:12:04,622 --> 00:12:09,506
that came out for PS4 was similar in its cinematic
style and was a mixture of Quick Time Events

150
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:13,989
and actual open world. Yeah, yeah. Like the
Arkham games. Right. How cool would an open

151
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:17,972
world Avengers game be though? That would be
so much better than what it looks like whatever

152
00:12:18,012 --> 00:12:23,296
this is. So as the Avengers are taking on the
threat on the Golden Gate Bridge, we get some

153
00:12:23,336 --> 00:12:28,920
dialogue between the characters and there's
a weird moment where Thor's like, there are

154
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,551
civilian hostages and tiny men with guns. And
then Iron Man like stops everything that he's

155
00:12:33,591 --> 00:12:40,136
doing and is like, did Thor just make a joke?
I think Thor just made a joke. And no, he didn't

156
00:12:40,156 --> 00:12:44,480
make a freaking joke. That was not a joke. You
know? And then Iron Man gets blasted out of

157
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,983
the air from like a repulsor tank. It's so poorly
written. But it's so much more than just that

158
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:54,287
moment too. It's like, oh, this looks interesting.
And like, they played us. And just like, who's

159
00:12:54,328 --> 00:12:58,950
writing this? Black Widow's voice sucks. I have
to say I really- All of their voices are kind

160
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:04,293
of off. I want Black Widow to have a Russian
accent. Please give her a Russian accent. It's

161
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:08,635
who she is. I mean, and obviously she's a spy.
She can speak multiple languages. She can easily

162
00:13:08,695 --> 00:13:12,716
hide her accent, but I don't think that she
would. She doesn't need to. Right, not when

163
00:13:12,736 --> 00:13:17,178
she's just being herself. So anyway, we have
Iron Man blasting some tanks. We have Hulk

164
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:22,281
blasting some tanks. It looks like the main
villain of the scene is Taskmaster, I wanna

165
00:13:22,321 --> 00:13:26,591
say, because he has like a skull face and a
hood. It might be, you know, an alternate design

166
00:13:26,631 --> 00:13:30,553
of the Crossbones character that we saw in Civil
War. Oh yeah, yeah. But he looks pretty formidable.

167
00:13:30,593 --> 00:13:33,675
There's a part where he's flying around the
bridge on a jetpack and Black Widow's like

168
00:13:33,835 --> 00:13:37,777
hitching a ride and attacking him at the same
time. That looks pretty cool. The camera work

169
00:13:37,937 --> 00:13:43,120
is pretty impressive, I have to say. But apparently
Captain America dies when the shield helicarrier's

170
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,343
core explodes or something like that. I don't
know what that fragment crystal was within

171
00:13:47,383 --> 00:13:51,705
the ship's core. It could have been like isotope
8, which is an element that they tend to use.

172
00:13:52,134 --> 00:13:55,976
in these Marvel games that's used to like power
up your character essentially. Huh. Like these

173
00:13:56,036 --> 00:14:00,298
RPG kind of elements. Yeah. But I don't really
think that Cap's dead. They make it seem like

174
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:04,061
Cap's dead, but I'm pretty sure he would survive
a crashing helicarrier into the water, you

175
00:14:04,081 --> 00:14:08,423
know? It's water. It's just water. It doesn't
hurt. He was trapped in ice, which is harder

176
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:13,686
than water. Exactly. But yeah, the game really
makes it seem like there's some kind of fallout

177
00:14:13,746 --> 00:14:17,649
from this incident where the Avengers have kind
of disbanded and then they have to unite once

178
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:22,075
again to take on this new threat. So in all,
this trailer has been kind of like a mixed

179
00:14:22,115 --> 00:14:27,940
bag with some interesting action bits, but also
some really poor graphics and dialogue and

180
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,123
story elements too. Would you buy it? Well,
yeah, I absolutely would buy it if I had a

181
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:35,745
platform to play it. That's one of the reasons
why we don't comment on gaming news too much

182
00:14:35,806 --> 00:14:41,009
on this podcast is because neither Jonathan
nor I are gamers anymore. We used to be, but

183
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:45,933
we kind of dropped off after the Wii era, I
guess. Yeah, I just sold my Xbox One S. Really?

184
00:14:46,173 --> 00:14:49,719
Yeah. I was thinking about getting a Switch
for the Ultimate Alliance Marvel game that's

185
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:54,000
coming out exclusively to that platform. Yeah,
that's interesting. I'm still wondering why

186
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,842
that's a Switch exclusive. I'm not sure. In
all, I'd be really interested in hearing what

187
00:14:58,082 --> 00:15:01,503
our listeners think about this trailer. Those
who are gamers and, you know, are a little

188
00:15:01,523 --> 00:15:05,705
bit more knowledgeable on the subject of modern
gaming. But speaking of gaming, this brings

189
00:15:05,745 --> 00:15:07,085
us to our question of the week.

190
00:15:11,766 --> 00:15:17,689
What has been your favorite DC or Marvel video
game and why? Post your answer to our Instagram,

191
00:15:17,749 --> 00:15:23,792
Twitter, Facebook, or email us at dynamicduelpodcast
at gmail.com. We'll pick our favorite answer

192
00:15:23,852 --> 00:15:28,255
and draw that person a dynamic duel no prize
that we'll post to social media. I think that

193
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:32,637
does it for all of the news for this episode.
So with all that done, let's go ahead and move

194
00:15:32,677 --> 00:15:37,520
on to the main event where we find out who'd
win in a fight between Sinestro and Magneto.

195
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,541
Are you scared? No. You should be. I'm not.

196
00:15:55,946 --> 00:16:00,990
Okay, Sinestro versus Magneto. Now you might
be asking yourself, why these two characters?

197
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:06,756
And actually, this was sort of inspired by the
internet, just by looking at what people thought

198
00:16:06,976 --> 00:16:11,420
would be good matches between DC and Marvel.
I saw this one and I was like, well, that's

199
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,704
an interesting match. I have no idea who would
win. They're both great, fascinating characters.

200
00:16:15,864 --> 00:16:21,389
They kind of skirt with like being really evil
and, you know, semi-heroic. Sinestro is heroic?

201
00:16:21,654 --> 00:16:25,435
Well, yeah, he started off as a Green Lantern.
Oh, that's right. That's right. But also, I

202
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:29,416
think what appealed to me for this particular
episode is that there's not too many people

203
00:16:29,616 --> 00:16:34,417
who could go up against a Green Lantern powers
wise. They're just so powerful and energetic.

204
00:16:34,837 --> 00:16:39,198
But I think Magneto is absolutely one of those
characters. He's not only one of the most powerful

205
00:16:39,318 --> 00:16:43,239
mutants in the Marvel universe, he's one of
the most powerful characters in general. His

206
00:16:43,359 --> 00:16:47,941
electromagnetic energy powers are just off the
charts. So I think Magneto is more than a match

207
00:16:47,961 --> 00:16:53,086
for Sinestro in this particular duel. More than
a match. Yes. We'll see. So the way we determine

208
00:16:53,106 --> 00:16:57,908
the winner between these two characters is through
statistics. We take their statistics and we

209
00:16:57,948 --> 00:17:02,110
run them through a simulation known as a Monte
Carlo simulation. And what that does is it

210
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:06,671
takes those stat numbers and it randomizes them
along a normal distribution which is in the

211
00:17:06,711 --> 00:17:10,793
shape of a bell curve. And that randomization
simulates all the variables that take place

212
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:14,883
during the course of battle. Now we compare
these randomizations against each other 1,000

213
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:20,787
times to simulate 1,000 battles. And from those
results we get a percentage of wins for each

214
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:24,370
character. Right, and the character with the
highest percentage of wins is the one that

215
00:17:24,390 --> 00:17:28,273
we declare the winner because they would win
most of the time. Right, because no one character

216
00:17:28,353 --> 00:17:32,956
ever wins 100% of the matches. That's never
happened. Right. There's always a way for Batman

217
00:17:32,976 --> 00:17:37,899
to beat someone like Superman. Do we try not
to be that lopsided in our matchup pairings?

218
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:41,834
We try to pick matches that we think will end
up as close to 50% as possible. and then are

219
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:45,815
just super excited when that doesn't happen.
If that doesn't happen. Right, right. So again,

220
00:17:45,935 --> 00:17:50,997
because Joseph and I are so biased, we've chosen
this approach because it's the most objective

221
00:17:51,057 --> 00:17:56,159
scientific approach that we could find. It used
to be done by Spike TV on their old television

222
00:17:56,199 --> 00:18:00,480
show, Deadliest Warrior. Right, it's objective.
There's no fan votes. We don't consider it

223
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,722
like outlier feats. It's just base statistics.
which are all based on the official Marvel

224
00:18:05,762 --> 00:18:10,724
Power Rankings grid. Right, and from Marvel's
criteria, we extrapolate the DC character statistics,

225
00:18:10,804 --> 00:18:15,105
as well as add our own stat categories in order
to make a more robust, accurate simulation.

226
00:18:15,305 --> 00:18:19,467
Things like evasiveness and range, things that,
you know, would play a factor in an actual

227
00:18:19,507 --> 00:18:24,008
battle. Right. So before we run this Monte Carlo
simulation with these character stats, we'll

228
00:18:24,028 --> 00:18:28,689
go over Magneto's and Sinestro's histories and
powers, so you're more familiar with the characters.

229
00:18:29,106 --> 00:18:32,987
I think I go first this time, so let me tell
you all about the character of Magneto, who

230
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:38,049
I have to say is one of my favorite villains
of all time. Because is he a tyrannical madman

231
00:18:38,189 --> 00:18:43,432
or a righteous zealot? He does take extreme
measures to fight for mutant equality, but

232
00:18:43,492 --> 00:18:48,394
have extreme measures not been taken also by
humans to suppress mutants? Do the ends justify

233
00:18:48,434 --> 00:18:53,436
the means when striving for a noble cause, and
who decides which cause is noble? These are

234
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:57,742
just some of the fascinating questions that
arise when analyzing Magneto. Now Magneto's

235
00:18:57,782 --> 00:19:03,245
real name is Max Eisenhart. Max Eisenhart was
born to a middle class Jewish family in Germany

236
00:19:03,325 --> 00:19:08,248
during the rise of the Nazi regime. He and his
family were persecuted by Nazi soldiers and

237
00:19:08,288 --> 00:19:13,091
beaten nearly every day and they ended up fleeing
to Poland. There they escaped to the Warsaw

238
00:19:13,131 --> 00:19:18,634
ghetto to avoid extermination but were eventually
captured and killed in a firing squad. Max

239
00:19:18,694 --> 00:19:23,097
unknowingly used his powers for the first time
to avoid being shot and was the only member

240
00:19:23,137 --> 00:19:27,856
of his family to survive. though he was soon
found and imprisoned in Auschwitz. There he

241
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:31,739
was forced to clean out the furnaces of the
crematoria where he would discover the bodies

242
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:36,083
of friends who had been picked for death, some
of them horribly disfigured by the experiments

243
00:19:36,203 --> 00:19:41,267
of geneticist super villain Mr. Sinister. He
reunited with an early childhood crush named

244
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:45,891
Magda in the extermination camp and saved her
from the gas chambers before the two escaped

245
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:51,756
and fled to a Carpathian mountain village where
Max changed his identity to Eric Lencher. They

246
00:19:51,836 --> 00:19:56,555
stayed there until the war's end. got married
and had a daughter named Anya. Yeah, it's not

247
00:19:56,575 --> 00:20:01,138
his name was Eric Linscher. In the movies, that's
what they refer to him as, but that's actually

248
00:20:01,198 --> 00:20:05,340
more of a gypsy name. And in the comics, they
didn't quite decide whether or not they wanted

249
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:10,863
Magneto to be Jewish or gypsy for a really long
time. So what they did is they gave him a Jewish

250
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:15,306
name that he later changed to a gypsy name.
Okay. Because he married Magda, who was part

251
00:20:15,326 --> 00:20:19,928
Romani. Right. So after they had their daughter
Anya, Eric moved his family to a Soviet Union

252
00:20:19,988 --> 00:20:24,275
city where he got a job as a carpenter. There,
he consciously used his mutant powers for the

253
00:20:24,315 --> 00:20:29,778
first time as he magnetically hurled a crowbar
at his boss for not paying him. As he arrived

254
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:34,741
home that evening, he saw his home burning down
with his daughter trapped in her room. He tried

255
00:20:34,761 --> 00:20:39,504
to save her but was held down by KGB goons who
had been called by Erik's boss to start the

256
00:20:39,544 --> 00:20:44,427
fire and beat him up. As Anya burned alive in
front of him, Erik killed the men who held

257
00:20:44,467 --> 00:20:49,866
him and the entire crowd watching and he destroyed
a portion of the city itself. Holy cow. Magda

258
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:54,508
fled in grief at the loss of her daughter and
out of fear of her husband. Eric traveled to

259
00:20:54,668 --> 00:21:00,190
Israel, where he worked as an orderly at a psychiatric
hospital for Holocaust survivors. There, he

260
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,952
first met Charles Xavier, who was volunteering
at the hospital. The two became friends and

261
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:09,474
would often discuss the subject of the budding
mutant race and its coexistence with the human

262
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:13,836
majority. The two eventually revealed their
powers to each other as they fought Hydra to

263
00:21:13,876 --> 00:21:18,802
save a kidnapped friend. Realizing kids and
Charles' views were incompatible, Eric stole

264
00:21:18,862 --> 00:21:24,146
Hydra's Nazi gold and went on a journey hunting
Nazi war criminals around the world. He developed

265
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:28,989
a notorious reputation and was nicknamed Magneto.
He witnessed the persecution of mutants first

266
00:21:29,029 --> 00:21:33,312
hand in his travels around the world and seeing
parallels with the persecution of Jews in Nazi

267
00:21:33,352 --> 00:21:38,616
Germany, decided to establish a group to fight
for mutant rights. He created an orbital space

268
00:21:38,636 --> 00:21:43,880
station to use as a base called Asteroid M and
recruited his alleged children Quicksilver

269
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,819
and Scarlet Witch as well as Toad and Mastermind.
This was the original Brotherhood of Mutants.

270
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:53,381
He led the group in acts of genetic terrorism
and were often stopped by Charles Xavier and

271
00:21:53,421 --> 00:21:58,624
his rival team of mutants called the X-Men,
who fought for peaceful mutant and human coexistence.

272
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:03,467
He would also end up clashing with the likes
of the Fantastic Four, the Sub-Mariner, Thor,

273
00:22:03,687 --> 00:22:07,709
and the Inhumans. Eventually, Quicksilver and
the Scarlet Witch left the team to join the

274
00:22:07,749 --> 00:22:11,852
Avengers, and you can learn more about them
in our Flash versus Quicksilver episode and

275
00:22:11,992 --> 00:22:16,283
our Zatanna versus Scarlet Witch episode, where
they find out. that they're not actually Magneto's

276
00:22:16,323 --> 00:22:21,387
children. Dumb. After many years of attacking
humans with various incarnations of his brotherhood

277
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:26,711
team, Eric was de-aged a few decades into his
younger self's body during an encounter with

278
00:22:26,731 --> 00:22:32,056
the alien Shi'ar race. Occasionally, Eric would
find himself fighting alongside the X-Men when

279
00:22:32,096 --> 00:22:36,639
external threats to mutant kind would show up,
such as William Stryker's purifiers, and during

280
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:41,944
the secret wars event. That was when the godlike
being known as the Beyonder transported Marvel's

281
00:22:41,964 --> 00:22:46,286
heroes and villains to Battleworld to do battle.
Eric was transported to the villain side, but

282
00:22:46,326 --> 00:22:51,547
he rejected them and fought alongside the heroes
instead. Later, he even led the X-Men and the

283
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:56,029
new mutants teams when Professor X had to be
taken off-world to be treated for an attack

284
00:22:56,089 --> 00:23:01,090
by Hydra. Though Eric thought he could manipulate
the teams into his belief of mutant superiority,

285
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:06,591
the reverse happened and he began questioning
his own methods. However, over time the pressures

286
00:23:06,611 --> 00:23:11,173
of keeping the teams safe got to him and he
became an overbearing and tyrannical team leader.

287
00:23:11,513 --> 00:23:15,290
He ended up leaving the X-Men and returning
to his old ways, after seeing his students

288
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:19,791
oppressed time and again. He stated that the
world should focus on just him as the mutant

289
00:23:19,811 --> 00:23:25,933
threat, and that by being the major quote villain,
he could help protect other mutants. His goal

290
00:23:25,953 --> 00:23:30,914
was no longer human conquest, but rather the
creation of a haven for mutant kind on Asteroid

291
00:23:31,154 --> 00:23:35,895
M. The United Nations Security Council deployed
satellites that disrupted Erick's powers on

292
00:23:35,975 --> 00:23:41,437
Asteroid M, and he deactivated every electronic
device on Earth in retaliation. He fought the

293
00:23:41,517 --> 00:23:46,167
X-Men again, once again led by Professor X.
and in the process extracted the adamantium

294
00:23:46,187 --> 00:23:50,430
from Wolverine's skeleton. You can learn more
about that in our Hawkman vs. Wolverine duel

295
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:55,254
episode. In the aftermath, the United Nations
ended up ceding governmental control of the

296
00:23:55,294 --> 00:24:01,178
small island nation of Genosha to Erik to use
as his mutant haven. Its population grew in

297
00:24:01,218 --> 00:24:06,302
the tens of thousands, but the island was eventually
attacked and destroyed by Mega Sentinels, an

298
00:24:06,342 --> 00:24:10,845
event during which Erik was presumed dead. As
he rose from Genosha's rubble and recovered

299
00:24:10,865 --> 00:24:15,720
his powers, His alleged daughter, the Scarlet
Witch, rewrote reality to one where Eric ruled

300
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:20,582
over a mutant-dominated world called the House
of M. That version of reality came crashing

301
00:24:20,602 --> 00:24:24,825
down, however, when the heroes realized the
truth, and the Scarlet Witch ended up restoring

302
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:28,847
reality, but not before stripping most of the
Earth's mutant population of their powers,

303
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:34,330
including Eric's. Broken and disillusioned,
Eric went into hiding. He worked with a high

304
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:38,952
evolutionary, the scientist that granted Quicksilver
and Scarlet Witch the powers, and was able

305
00:24:38,972 --> 00:24:43,566
to regain his powers through his technology.
though the machine could only be used once.

306
00:24:44,066 --> 00:24:48,828
Of course. Eric made it his mission to try and
restore the mutant populace's lost powers,

307
00:24:49,249 --> 00:24:53,871
which brought his attention to the first mutant
born after the events of House of M, named

308
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:59,033
Hope Summers. He joined the X-Men on their new
island base called Utopia, which was actually

309
00:24:59,133 --> 00:25:03,635
Asteroid M resurfaced from the ocean's depths.
During the Avengers versus X-Men event, the

310
00:25:03,655 --> 00:25:08,597
Phoenix Force returned to Earth. Magneto sided
with the X-Men, but attacked Cyclops when his

311
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:13,095
Phoenix powers grew out of control. Hope Summers
and the Scarlet Witch were able to use the

312
00:25:13,135 --> 00:25:17,858
Phoenix to restore the lost powers of Earth's
former mutants, fulfilling Eric's mission.

313
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:22,902
He later tracked down the Red Skull after learning
that the villain was using Genosha as a concentration

314
00:25:22,942 --> 00:25:27,825
camp for many of these newly restored mutants,
and he beat him to death. However, Schmidt

315
00:25:27,845 --> 00:25:32,769
was soon resurrected in the psyche of Red Onslaught,
whom Eric helped defeat alongside the X-Men

316
00:25:32,849 --> 00:25:37,312
and the Avengers. Though Earth's mutants were
restored, many of them started dying due to

317
00:25:37,392 --> 00:25:42,043
exposure to the Terrigan Mists' released in
the atmosphere by Black Bolt, whom you can

318
00:25:42,063 --> 00:25:47,007
learn more about in our Shazam vs Black Bolt
duel. This forced Eric to again try and protect

319
00:25:47,067 --> 00:25:52,391
the mutant race through any means necessary,
establishing a new asteroid M and a new Brotherhood

320
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:57,014
of Mutants. Isn't that the Brotherhood of Evil
Mutants? Um, it was initially called the Brotherhood

321
00:25:57,054 --> 00:26:00,596
of Evil Mutants in the comics, yes, but that's
kind of been retconned, because it wouldn't

322
00:26:00,616 --> 00:26:05,560
make sense for Magneto to refer to his own team
as evil considering that he views his cause

323
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,390
as righteous. Right, right, I was thinking the
same thing. Okay. Although there was a theory

324
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:14,473
in the Earth-X graphic novel where the Watcher
surmised that Magneto called his brotherhood

325
00:26:14,633 --> 00:26:20,036
evil in order to force Charles Xavier to take
a moral stance basically. Interesting. Yeah,

326
00:26:20,116 --> 00:26:24,759
which, I don't know, still doesn't make sense
to me. No. Anyway, Magneto's powers are to

327
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:29,781
control the fundamental forces of electromagnetism,
and he is one of the Earth's most powerful

328
00:26:29,841 --> 00:26:35,404
mutants. With his power, he has complete molecular
control of metals, with effects that range

329
00:26:35,424 --> 00:26:39,715
from being able to control a person's blood
flow. using the iron in their hemoglobin, or

330
00:26:39,755 --> 00:26:44,378
he can move mountains, or he can even manipulate
the planet's electromagnetic field. Wouldn't

331
00:26:44,398 --> 00:26:51,783
that like destroy the planet? Yes. Maybe. I
don't know. But he can fly, he can create impenetrable

332
00:26:51,803 --> 00:26:57,127
force fields, and fire electromagnetic blasts
and pulses. Now, can he control all metals

333
00:26:57,207 --> 00:27:02,951
or just iron? All ferrous metals. Okay. Basically
any metal that can be magnetized. Okay. Although

334
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:08,514
he can also magnetize non-magnetic elements,
so, you know. Just metal, just think metal,

335
00:27:08,534 --> 00:27:13,955
okay? Okay. Magneto can also reinforce the metal
fibers of his outfit to be near the strength

336
00:27:13,995 --> 00:27:19,657
of adamantium. In addition, he also has telepathic
resistance through his helmet, and he also

337
00:27:19,677 --> 00:27:24,538
has a genius level intellect. And that's the
character. I mean, I guess that's impressive.

338
00:27:25,118 --> 00:27:29,760
I mean, not as impressive as like a ring that
can allow you to create anything you can imagine.

339
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:34,461
I mean, Magneto can create anything he imagines
out of metal, so. Well, let's hope there's

340
00:27:34,481 --> 00:27:41,548
some around. Let me get into Sinestro. Thal
Sinestro is from the planet Korugar in space

341
00:27:41,568 --> 00:27:48,431
sector 1417. He was an orderly anthropologist
on his planet until one day the green lantern

342
00:27:48,471 --> 00:27:56,674
for 1417 named Praul Gasgatha crash landed near
Sinestro, injured and apparently dying from

343
00:27:56,714 --> 00:28:02,577
a battle with a weaponer of Qord, which is a
planet from DC's antimatter universe. Gasgatha

344
00:28:02,617 --> 00:28:08,564
gave up his ring to Sinestro. whom the ring
deemed to be fearless and honorable, and despite

345
00:28:08,704 --> 00:28:14,669
not knowing what the ring could do, Sinestro
was able to destroy the Kordian attackers in

346
00:28:14,729 --> 00:28:20,833
pursuit of Gasgatha. When the dust settled,
Gasgatha was still alive. Realizing he could

347
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:27,457
recover with the aid of his Green Lantern Ring,
Gasgatha asked Sinestro to return it, but Sinestro,

348
00:28:27,778 --> 00:28:34,210
disgusted by how easily Gasgatha gave up that
power, left Gasgatha to die. and became Sector

349
00:28:34,230 --> 00:28:40,273
1417's new Green Lantern. Dang, that's not very
honorable. That's true. That ring was stupid.

350
00:28:41,334 --> 00:28:45,817
The Guardians of the Universe, whom I'll refer
to as the Owens, and whom you can learn more

351
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:51,180
about in our Green Lantern vs. Nova episode,
were the creators and leaders of the interstellar

352
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:56,343
peacekeeping force known as the Green Lantern
Corps. They never found out about how Sinestro

353
00:28:56,423 --> 00:29:02,066
let Gosgotha die, and instead lauded him for
his competence with the ring. Doesn't the ring

354
00:29:02,086 --> 00:29:06,849
have its own sentience and wouldn't it tell
on him? It didn't. In his prime, Sinestro was

355
00:29:06,889 --> 00:29:13,752
the greatest green lantern in all 3600 sectors
of the universe. Under his vigilant protection,

356
00:29:13,772 --> 00:29:20,876
Sector 1417 was almost entirely devoid of crime.
He mentored and befriended many other green

357
00:29:20,896 --> 00:29:28,020
lanterns, including the alien Abin Sur of Sector
2814, where Earth resides. Sinestro and Abin

358
00:29:28,081 --> 00:29:34,291
Sur became such close friends Sinestro married
Abin's sister, Erin, and together they had

359
00:29:34,311 --> 00:29:40,314
a daughter. Abin Sur had learned from an alien
named Atrocitus of a prophecy known as Blackest

360
00:29:40,434 --> 00:29:46,536
Night, a time when darkness would rise up in
the universe and extinguish all light. Atrocitus

361
00:29:46,556 --> 00:29:52,539
was the leader of a prophetic terrorist gabal
against the Owens, and as Abin Sur was taking

362
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:58,541
the captured Atrocitus to the prison planet
of Yismalt for his crimes, Atrocitus killed

363
00:29:58,601 --> 00:30:05,524
Abin and the two crash-landed on Earth. Sinestro
attacked Atrocitus while on Earth and recaptured

364
00:30:05,564 --> 00:30:11,586
him with the help of Abansur's successor, the
human Hal Jordan, whom Sinestro initially deemed

365
00:30:11,766 --> 00:30:18,369
unworthy. As he was imprisoned, Atrocitus taunted
Sinestro with a personal prophecy about the

366
00:30:18,409 --> 00:30:24,412
chaos and deadly coup that would lead to Sinestro's
fall from grace within the Green Lantern Corps.

367
00:30:29,502 --> 00:30:35,664
and began crossing ethical lines in order to
maintain order within his sector, eventually

368
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:43,228
dominating each planet as a dictator who ruled
by fear. Recognizing Sinestro's dark turn and

369
00:30:43,288 --> 00:30:48,230
fearing for their daughter's life, his wife
Erin secretly gave their daughter away and

370
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:54,713
fled, dying soon after from a suicide bomber
who had intended to kill Sinestro, which only

371
00:30:54,773 --> 00:31:01,249
bolstered his tyranny. The Owens ordered Sinestro
to train Hal Jordan, who, despite his recklessness,

372
00:31:01,649 --> 00:31:07,773
Sinestro eventually befriended. During their
training, Hal traveled to Sector 1417 with

373
00:31:07,833 --> 00:31:13,237
Sinestro to quell a rebellion that had arisen
during Sinestro's absence. During this time,

374
00:31:13,517 --> 00:31:19,641
Hal realized Sinestro was using his ring to
rule over his sector. Guilt stricken for helping

375
00:31:19,681 --> 00:31:25,045
him stop the rebellion, Hal kept Sinestro's
secret and instead imprisoned both of them

376
00:31:25,325 --> 00:31:30,641
on Earth. The Owens sent Manhunters, the emotionless,
energy-draining android precursors to the Green

377
00:31:30,682 --> 00:31:36,647
Lanterns, to Earth to capture both Green Lanterns
and put them on trial. Hal testified against

378
00:31:36,747 --> 00:31:41,711
Sinestro, who was imprisoned in the Anti-Matter
universe, and swore revenge against Hal and

379
00:31:41,731 --> 00:31:47,597
the Owens. While there, he met the Weaponers
of Chord, who hated the Owens as much as he

380
00:31:47,617 --> 00:31:53,101
did. They fashioned him a yellow power ring
and sent him back to the Positive Matter universe,

381
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:58,734
where he became the Green Lantern Corps' most
powerful nemesis, due, at the time, to their

382
00:31:58,814 --> 00:32:05,400
ring's inability to affect the color yellow.
Eventually, thanks mostly to Hell Jordan, Sinestro

383
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:10,244
was imprisoned in the Green Lantern Corps' central
power battery, which powers the rings of each

384
00:32:10,324 --> 00:32:15,688
member of the Corps. While in the battery, Sinestro
discovered that the Green Lantern's weakness

385
00:32:15,728 --> 00:32:21,913
to yellow came from an entity known as Parallax,
the yellow embodiment of fear in the universe

386
00:32:22,338 --> 00:32:27,921
that the Owens had also imprisoned in the battery
millions of years prior. Sinestro influenced

387
00:32:27,961 --> 00:32:33,604
Parallax into manipulating Kal Jordan and driving
him insane when Hal's hometown of Coast City

388
00:32:33,724 --> 00:32:38,767
was destroyed. Hal went on a rampage, killing
the rest of the core in order to drain their

389
00:32:38,807 --> 00:32:43,809
energy, and made his way to the planet Oa to
absorb the central power battery. The Owens

390
00:32:43,869 --> 00:32:49,532
released Sinestro from his prison to confront
and defeat Hal, but Sinestro taunted Hal into

391
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:55,839
killing him and the Owens. bringing Hal fully
over the edge and allowing Parallax to fully

392
00:32:55,879 --> 00:33:02,060
possess him. It was later revealed, however,
that the Sinestro who died was an energy construct

393
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:08,122
made by Parallax and puppeteered by Sinestro,
who went into hiding once the core was destroyed,

394
00:33:08,542 --> 00:33:14,724
biding his time until Parallax was powerful
enough to power his yellow ring. Parallax had

395
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:20,025
been destroyed but was slowly regaining his
energy through Hal Jordan in his new form as

396
00:33:20,065 --> 00:33:24,979
the Spectre. who you can learn more about in
our Spectre vs Galactus episode. Hal Jordan

397
00:33:25,079 --> 00:33:30,241
re-emerged as a Green Lantern once again, now
free from Parallax's influence, and he and

398
00:33:30,281 --> 00:33:36,204
Sinestro fought, resulting in Sinestro's yellow
ring to be destroyed and him being instantly

399
00:33:36,244 --> 00:33:41,526
teleported back to the antimatter universe.
With the help of the universe-destroying entity

400
00:33:41,606 --> 00:33:48,349
from the antimatter universe known as the Anti-Monitor,
Sinestro formed the Sinestro Corps, a team

401
00:33:48,409 --> 00:33:53,552
of frightful beings from across the universe.
who wielded yellow power rings to combat the

402
00:33:53,592 --> 00:33:58,576
reformation of the Green Lantern Corps. With
the Green Lantern's universal entity of courage

403
00:33:58,616 --> 00:34:04,641
and willpower, a being known as Ion, captured
by the Sinestro Corps, the Owens rewrote the

404
00:34:04,681 --> 00:34:11,306
Green Lantern bylaws to allow Green Lanterns
to use lethal force, which was Sinestro's plan

405
00:34:11,707 --> 00:34:16,811
all along, making him victorious once again
despite him and the Corps being defeated in

406
00:34:16,851 --> 00:34:24,299
battle on Earth. Sinestro was abducted from
the Green Lantern Corps by Atrocitus and his

407
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:30,382
newly created Red Lantern Corps, who learned
of Sinestro's daughter, Soranekhna II, who

408
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:36,204
was unaware of her parentage and had been the
Green Lantern of Sector 1417 for some time.

409
00:34:36,564 --> 00:34:40,646
Shortly after Sinestro was rescued from the
Green Lantern Corps by his own corps members,

410
00:34:41,186 --> 00:34:46,949
heroes and villains who have died throughout
DC continuity began to arise as reanimated

411
00:34:47,029 --> 00:34:54,237
zombie corpses wielding Black Lantern Rings,
including Aben Sur and his sister Erin, Sinestro's

412
00:34:54,277 --> 00:35:00,500
former wife. It took mass recruitment by the
Green, Yellow, and Red Lantern Corps, as well

413
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:05,543
as the newly formed Orange, Blue, Indigo, and
Violet teams, to gather enough white light

414
00:35:05,623 --> 00:35:10,746
when combining their energy to attack the Black
Lantern's central power battery, created from

415
00:35:10,786 --> 00:35:17,170
the corpse of the Anti-Monitor by Necron, the
universal embodiment of death. Necron planned

416
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:23,232
on summoning the embodiment of life, known simply
as the Entity, so he could destroy it, and

417
00:35:23,292 --> 00:35:29,675
subsequently all life in the universe, in one
fell swoop. Once summoned, the Entity possessed

418
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:35,918
Sinestro, who used the power to fight and help
defeat Necron, saving the universe. Sinestro

419
00:35:35,938 --> 00:35:41,840
became a Green Lantern once again after an evil
Owen known as Krona captured his yellow ring,

420
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,390
along with the seven colored universal entities
of emotion. Helping defeat Krona as a Green

421
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:52,714
Lantern, Sinestro was allowed to keep his ring,
though he returned to the head of the Sinestro

422
00:35:52,754 --> 00:35:58,777
Corps when he realized the Owens were manipulating
him into destroying the Yellow Lanterns and

423
00:35:58,817 --> 00:36:05,281
eventually all other Cores save for the Green.
In retaliation, Sinestro killed all but two

424
00:36:05,321 --> 00:36:10,564
of the Owens and set off to find and save the
survivors of his destroyed planet of Korugar.

425
00:36:13,502 --> 00:36:19,043
of an ultraviolet light outside of the emotional
spectrum that channels all negative emotion

426
00:36:19,123 --> 00:36:24,865
in general, which he can use to create both
invisible constructs and manipulate life forms.

427
00:36:25,465 --> 00:36:30,606
In this match however, Sinestro will have his
yellow power ring, which is primarily capable

428
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:37,248
of creating yellow energy and hard light constructs,
such as force fields or like, scary spiders.

429
00:36:37,868 --> 00:36:43,387
It's also capable of empathically determining
an opponent's fears. which it can amplify.

430
00:36:44,027 --> 00:36:49,512
His ring also grants him enhanced strength,
speed, durability, and flight. The ring does,

431
00:36:49,572 --> 00:36:55,877
however, need to be recharged on occasion, and
it is disrupted by the blue energy of hope.

432
00:36:56,398 --> 00:37:01,162
That's Sinestro. Sometimes Magneto's energy
in the comics is depicted as blue. But it's

433
00:37:01,202 --> 00:37:05,806
not very Magnetic energy. Hopeful. It's not
hopeful. Sure it is. Sure it is. All right,

434
00:37:05,886 --> 00:37:09,189
that does it for the backstories and powers
for each of these characters. Now, before we

435
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:13,275
run the simulations, we like to discuss how
we think one of those 1000 matches would actually

436
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:17,878
play out and kind of like an improvised scenario.
Yeah. The final results aren't based on the

437
00:37:17,898 --> 00:37:22,841
speculation. This is just for funsies. Now we
don't set any rules for our particular scenario,

438
00:37:23,161 --> 00:37:28,204
save that the characters don't know anything
about each other than they are threats to each

439
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:32,447
other that need to be put down. They start 50
yards apart on whatever battlefield they're

440
00:37:32,527 --> 00:37:38,131
on and the battlefield is nondescript basically.
We don't take stats for the environment within

441
00:37:38,171 --> 00:37:41,854
these simulations. The characters have to win
on their own merits. So the environment does

442
00:37:41,894 --> 00:37:46,137
not play any sort of factor within the battle
itself because some characters can win in certain

443
00:37:46,157 --> 00:37:51,081
environments and have disadvantages in others.
Right. Exactly. Like if this fight took place

444
00:37:51,141 --> 00:37:57,706
on Mars, Sinestro is dead. Is he though? Yeah.
Cause Mars is full of iron. I guess so is earth.

445
00:37:57,866 --> 00:38:02,282
And if this match took place, like in the middle
of nowhere space, Magneto would- pretty much

446
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:06,604
be dead. Which is not true because Magneto can
actually draw upon magnetic fields of surrounding

447
00:38:06,664 --> 00:38:11,387
planets and stars. Oh, so like millions of miles
away? Yeah, he can't do that. It would take

448
00:38:11,407 --> 00:38:15,269
a long time for that to get done. It doesn't.
He used the magnetic power of the sun in a

449
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:20,052
fight against Iron Man in Avengers versus X-Men
to strengthen himself. It made him stronger?

450
00:38:20,272 --> 00:38:24,995
Yes, he can use magnetic fields to make himself
stronger. They fought in space too. And Magneto

451
00:38:25,015 --> 00:38:29,097
like created his own suit of armor using the
metal from nearby satellites. I'm talking about

452
00:38:29,197 --> 00:38:34,105
deep space. Okay, there are no stars or asteroids
or anything around. What are you talking about?

453
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:37,948
There are no stars in deep space. Deep space.
Okay, Neil deGrasse Tyson. Yeah. You don't

454
00:38:37,968 --> 00:38:42,472
know anything about space. Don't act like you
know about space. Deep space nine. Anyway,

455
00:38:43,633 --> 00:38:47,616
let's go ahead and get this fight started. So
they start 50 yards apart from each other and

456
00:38:47,656 --> 00:38:52,841
they know that they have to beat each other.
Who goes first? I actually think that Sinestro

457
00:38:52,901 --> 00:38:57,945
is a little bit more manic than Magneto. Yeah,
I agree. I think Sinestro would actually go

458
00:38:58,065 --> 00:39:02,020
first. considering that he might also be a little
bit faster. Well, I think he starts off just

459
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:08,585
by sort of like doing a scan of Magneto, an
empathic scan of what Magneto fears. Well,

460
00:39:08,625 --> 00:39:13,688
Magneto can't be scanned because he has that
helmet that blocks his mind from being read.

461
00:39:13,989 --> 00:39:17,912
He's reading his heart. He's not reading, he
doesn't have a heart helmet. There's no thought

462
00:39:18,052 --> 00:39:24,636
or memory base in the human heart. It's emotion.
No, emotions are not physically held in the

463
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:31,448
heart, they're held in the brain, fool. Still,
like, the laws of Marvel telepathy being blocked

464
00:39:31,468 --> 00:39:37,313
by helmets doesn't apply to DC. Well, it applies
in this case, so I'm sorry. Why? Because that's

465
00:39:37,353 --> 00:39:42,258
his whole thing. He has telepathic resistance.
It's not telepathy, it's empathy. Same f***ing

466
00:39:42,418 --> 00:39:49,744
thing. Is that the s***? Same frickin' thing.
Is it? Yeah. Can't be scanned. Besides, Magneto

467
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:54,468
doesn't have fears anyway, it's not gonna help
you. While you're busy scanning, Magneto sees

468
00:39:54,488 --> 00:39:59,407
this guy who he knows to be a threat. And he
shoots an electromagnetic blast at him. Like

469
00:39:59,447 --> 00:40:05,349
lightning? Yeah, it's kind of depicted as lightning-ish
in the comics. Okay, well, since Sinestro's

470
00:40:05,389 --> 00:40:11,092
ring was scanning Magneto, it senses the buildup
of this electromagnetism and puts up a shield

471
00:40:11,132 --> 00:40:17,034
right away, blocking the blast. Okay? So then
that's when Sinestro retaliates by creating

472
00:40:17,694 --> 00:40:23,037
like a million little tiny scary spiders that
just go all around Magneto. Except how did

473
00:40:23,057 --> 00:40:28,039
they get past Magneto's forcefield? They're
created within the force field. You can't project

474
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:31,722
energy through the force field. Who said his
force field is up? You didn't even say his

475
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:36,685
force field is up. Magneto traditionally has
his force field up almost at all times. It's

476
00:40:36,846 --> 00:40:42,069
usually just invisible. And that's canon. What?
Yeah. Especially he would have it up during,

477
00:40:42,129 --> 00:40:47,193
at the start of this fight. Okay, so the spiders
crawl all around this force field, and it lets

478
00:40:47,353 --> 00:40:53,257
Sinestro know exactly where this force field
is. Yeah, all around him. Okay. So, once he's

479
00:40:53,297 --> 00:40:58,772
completely encased, in spiders, that's when
Sinestro creates like this vice grip, picks

480
00:40:58,812 --> 00:41:04,495
Magneto up by his forcefield, and just like
curls him into space. Except Magneto breaks

481
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:09,338
the vice grip by expanding his forcefield to
break the construct that's holding him. Shut

482
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:15,261
the fu- shut the front door. I almost said it.
And as soon as he breaks the vice grip, Magneto

483
00:41:15,361 --> 00:41:21,925
flies towards Sinestro and he shoots this huge
giant electromagnetic beam at Sinestro. Boom,

484
00:41:22,005 --> 00:41:28,466
forcefield blocked. We gotta get around these
force fields somehow. Alright, so, um, Magneto

485
00:41:28,526 --> 00:41:33,830
taps into whatever, like, electromagnetic currents
are surrounding them. Because everything has

486
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:39,075
an electromagnetic field, whether it be life
forms or even planets, radiation out in space,

487
00:41:39,115 --> 00:41:44,419
wherever they are, there will be an electromagnetic
field that Magneto can tap into and kind of

488
00:41:44,779 --> 00:41:49,804
use to telekinetically shake Sinestro within
his force field, and kind of like, rattle him

489
00:41:49,844 --> 00:41:54,162
around like a hamster in a hamster ball. And
Sinestro's just like slamming back and forth

490
00:41:54,182 --> 00:41:59,285
against the walls and getting all bloodied from
that. Okay. Which causes Sinestro to drop his

491
00:41:59,345 --> 00:42:04,927
force field. Yeah, yeah, yeah. At that moment,
Magneto sends out this electromagnetic pulse

492
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:11,570
that affects Sinestro's electric nervous system
and basically gives him a stroke. What? Yeah.

493
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:17,973
No, it doesn't. Because as the electromagnetic
pulse is coming at him, Huh? He creates a battery

494
00:42:18,153 --> 00:42:23,836
that absorbs that electrical energy. and uses
it to power a big ass cannon, which he fires

495
00:42:23,956 --> 00:42:28,880
right at Magneto. Okay, well Magneto still has
his force field, but I would assume that a

496
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:34,624
blast that big would actually start taxing his
ability to maintain that force field. Yes,

497
00:42:34,804 --> 00:42:39,247
it's a very big laser. So once the cannon is
done shooting at him, it's out of the energy

498
00:42:39,267 --> 00:42:45,331
that it absorbed or whatever, Magneto drops
his force field and splinters his helmet into

499
00:42:45,451 --> 00:42:51,450
a bunch of tiny metal shards that he just sends
hurling. straight at Sinestro's face. As they're

500
00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:57,113
coming at him, this like dragon wing sweeps
in and like blocks the shards and then like

501
00:42:57,133 --> 00:43:02,615
the wing moves to reveal this giant ass dragon
that then just like fires a huge fireball at

502
00:43:02,655 --> 00:43:07,737
Magneto. And this thing's scary, let me tell
you. But as Magneto's jumping out of the way

503
00:43:07,797 --> 00:43:12,679
of the dragon's flames, he takes all those metal
shards that are within the dragon's wings and

504
00:43:12,699 --> 00:43:17,501
he forms them together into this giant blade
that just slices the dragon's head off and

505
00:43:17,521 --> 00:43:23,291
decapitates him. But the dragon's head like
falls off, rolls to the like grand, but then

506
00:43:23,331 --> 00:43:27,673
like spider legs sprout out of it and it starts
going at Magneto. It's like, I'm going to get

507
00:43:27,693 --> 00:43:35,737
you. That is scary. Magneto's like, what the
hell? Is hella curse word? I don't know. Anyway.

508
00:43:35,757 --> 00:43:39,859
Okay. So Magneto is like freaking the heck out.
All right. So what he does is he summons his

509
00:43:39,919 --> 00:43:44,541
helmet back to him, but he creates a full protective
mask out of it with like mesh eye holes and

510
00:43:44,561 --> 00:43:48,106
everything like that. So he could still see
out of it. He reinforces all the metal around

511
00:43:48,146 --> 00:43:53,028
his body in his metal weave suit so that it's
about as durable as adamantium, okay? Uh-huh.

512
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:58,351
So this thing's like lunging at him, but he's
armored, so it can't like affect him too much.

513
00:43:58,411 --> 00:44:05,093
And he draws upon the electromagnetic energy
of whatever large planet may be nearby him,

514
00:44:05,133 --> 00:44:09,995
whether it's Earth or it's the Sun or it's another
planet or wherever he is. So he's like coursing

515
00:44:10,015 --> 00:44:14,697
with like this glowing electromagnetic energy,
and it increases his strength so much so that

516
00:44:14,717 --> 00:44:19,023
he just punches this dragon right in the face
and rips his spider legs off. Okay, but as

517
00:44:19,083 --> 00:44:23,484
Magneto is too busy fighting this dragon head,
that's when Sinestro sort of like fills the

518
00:44:23,544 --> 00:44:28,946
area around Magneto with this like ooze that
he's just like drowning in. And then at that

519
00:44:28,986 --> 00:44:33,527
point, Magneto again creates his forcefield
that emanates from his body and pushes the

520
00:44:33,607 --> 00:44:37,968
ooze away, creating basically an air bubble
for himself. And then he probably just like

521
00:44:38,408 --> 00:44:43,322
spins that bubble so that it like sends all
the ooze flying away from him. Okay, well now

522
00:44:43,362 --> 00:44:48,203
that Magneto is dizzy as heck No, no, he was
just spinning the force field, not himself

523
00:44:48,223 --> 00:44:52,584
within those force fields Oh, dumb But he shoots
out this energy blast that connects to Sinestro's

524
00:44:52,664 --> 00:44:57,666
ring And taps into whatever, you know, alien
metals are within the construction of the ring

525
00:44:57,726 --> 00:45:03,767
itself What? Yeah And then- That's like anti-matter
metal You can't do anything with that Wait,

526
00:45:03,807 --> 00:45:10,589
did you say the word metal? Did you say the
word metal? It's anti-matter Like metal- Metal

527
00:45:10,609 --> 00:45:20,158
Dang it! So he pulls the ring off of Sinestro's
hand. No. What? Actually, in the metal event

528
00:45:20,198 --> 00:45:26,162
that they had in the comics recently, like,
yeah, the rings are metal. You are fudged.

529
00:45:27,643 --> 00:45:32,106
So he pulls the ring off of Sinestro's hand,
and then it brings it towards him, realizing

530
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:38,431
like it's this awesome energy weapon, and Magneto
puts the ring on his own hand. Okay. Little

531
00:45:38,471 --> 00:45:44,374
did you know that Sinestro has built-in safeguards
for anyone else. Who wears his rings? Okay.

532
00:45:44,655 --> 00:45:50,257
So as Magneto puts on his hand, that's when
it like generates a saw blade and chops off

533
00:45:50,297 --> 00:45:55,959
Magneto's hand. Oh, shit! What? This took him
by surprise. Okay, okay, I'll accept that.

534
00:45:56,359 --> 00:46:00,881
So Magneto just lost a hand, but he's not gonna
bleed out because he can hold back his own

535
00:46:00,901 --> 00:46:04,143
blood from flowing out of his arm due to the
iron that's within it. Just like cauterize

536
00:46:04,163 --> 00:46:11,250
it? In effect, yes. Okay, well meanwhile, the
ring flies off of the amputated hand. back

537
00:46:11,290 --> 00:46:16,452
onto Sinestro's finger. But before it gets back
to Sinestro's finger, Magneto stalls it mid-air,

538
00:46:16,492 --> 00:46:21,334
and at which point, Magneto removes his helmet
again, and like turns it into like this metallic

539
00:46:21,474 --> 00:46:30,217
dust that flies over to Sinestro, and Sinestro
inhales it, basically. What is this, X2? Yes.

540
00:46:31,058 --> 00:46:35,460
But I say that before the dust could even get
to Sinestro, he runs over to the rank himself,

541
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,221
puts it on, and then just creates like- But
already has all this metal in his body now.

542
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:44,511
Well, little did you know that the Green Lanterns
could actually phase through matter on certain

543
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:50,232
instances. So I'm sure Sinestro can do it as
well. What?! So yeah, he just uses the ring

544
00:46:50,452 --> 00:46:55,914
to phase his molecules away from the metal bits.
Leaving himself vulnerable, standing right

545
00:46:55,954 --> 00:47:01,376
next to all these metal bits that form like
this liquid that just wraps around Sinestro's

546
00:47:01,616 --> 00:47:09,330
ring and hand. And then Magneto makes Sinestro
start punching himself. Okay, well Sinestro

547
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:14,231
uses his ring to pick up Magneto's amputated
hand and he uses that to start slapping Magneto

548
00:47:14,291 --> 00:47:21,313
across the face. Over and over. In fact, Sinestro
creates like a hundred more zombie hands that

549
00:47:21,373 --> 00:47:27,015
also start slapping Magneto around. Alright,
so Magneto either gets slapped to death or

550
00:47:27,235 --> 00:47:32,116
Sinestro punches himself to death with a metal
fist. Sure, yeah. I did not see that happening.

551
00:47:33,017 --> 00:47:36,618
But I think that does it for this particular
scenario. We'll end it there. and we'll go

552
00:47:36,658 --> 00:47:41,066
to the simulations and run the numbers and figure
out exactly who would win between these two

553
00:47:41,086 --> 00:47:41,947
villains. Let's do it.

554
00:47:46,382 --> 00:47:51,325
Okay, I can't do the mental math off the top
of my head as to who is coming out on top of

555
00:47:51,365 --> 00:47:55,968
this. This is definitely gonna be a surprise
for me. Yeah, it's pretty close here, which

556
00:47:56,048 --> 00:48:01,611
I think makes it a great match. We did figure
that Sinestro is faster than Magneto. Right,

557
00:48:01,651 --> 00:48:07,415
but then Magneto is slightly stronger because
he could essentially affect planets. And while

558
00:48:07,795 --> 00:48:12,402
Sinestro can do the same, it would take a lot
more effort. You think a lot more willpower

559
00:48:12,442 --> 00:48:16,124
to lift a mountain as opposed to Magneto who
can lift a mountain fairly effortlessly. Right,

560
00:48:16,224 --> 00:48:20,465
exactly. Fighting skill, Sinestro came out on
top. Yeah, because he has the training through

561
00:48:20,485 --> 00:48:24,087
the Green Lantern Corps. Right, right. You don't
really see Magneto fight hand to hand too often.

562
00:48:24,387 --> 00:48:28,729
He probably does have some experience in hand
to hand combat, but no formal training. Uh-huh.

563
00:48:28,769 --> 00:48:33,431
Where else do they differ? In terms of durability,
we said that due to Magneto's heavy armor,

564
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:38,033
it made him less vulnerable to direct attack
as opposed to Sinestro, who has to create a

565
00:48:38,093 --> 00:48:43,307
construct to defend himself. Right, and shield
creation is more represented through the evasiveness

566
00:48:43,347 --> 00:48:49,370
stat, which we more accurately define as the
ability to avoid being hit. As opposed to durability,

567
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:54,272
which is the ability to resist or recover from
injury to your body directly. Right, exactly.

568
00:48:54,672 --> 00:48:58,553
Intelligence-wise, they're about the same, I
would say. Yeah, yeah, they're both smart villains.

569
00:48:58,974 --> 00:49:03,115
So yeah, taking all those numbers and running
them through the Monte Carlo, we have a winner.

570
00:49:03,175 --> 00:49:06,977
Now, who do you think it's gonna be? I really
hope it's Sinestro, but you put up a much better

571
00:49:07,057 --> 00:49:11,286
fight than I thought you would. Like I thought
I was totally gonna own this, but that freaking

572
00:49:11,346 --> 00:49:15,427
force field, like force fields are hard to get
through. It's always hard when you have two

573
00:49:15,447 --> 00:49:19,008
characters that can have full and penetrable
force fields going at all times. Right, right.

574
00:49:19,028 --> 00:49:23,149
So you need to find a way to kind of like negate
that. And I think that we did that hopefully

575
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:27,030
in a way that makes sense. Cause you know, the
comic book writers do it all the time. So we'll

576
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:31,892
see. So, all right. It was an extremely close
match. I'm proud of both of these guys. The

577
00:49:31,972 --> 00:49:41,869
winner of the Magneto Sinestro match is Magneto.
Ah, he won. 57.1% of the matches. Whoa. Compared

578
00:49:41,889 --> 00:49:49,355
to Sinestro's 429 wins. What? I cannot fathom
this. Yeah, Magneto won man. Deal with it.

579
00:49:49,876 --> 00:49:56,022
You have to deal with this. No. Actually I did
not quite see that coming as well. I think

580
00:49:56,182 --> 00:50:03,008
the big factor here was that Magneto always
is wearing his armor. Whether or not his armor

581
00:50:03,088 --> 00:50:07,363
itself has been reinforced. According to the
comics, almost nearly always has his force

582
00:50:07,383 --> 00:50:11,664
field going. He's almost always in a defensive
state. Sinestro could do that, but it would

583
00:50:11,684 --> 00:50:16,046
drain the energy in his ring. Right, right.
Considering we didn't take into consideration

584
00:50:16,126 --> 00:50:20,788
any environmental metal within our scenario,
if there was environmental metal, Sinestro

585
00:50:20,808 --> 00:50:25,230
would have that much harder of a time. I forgot
to take into account that electromagnetism

586
00:50:25,350 --> 00:50:29,632
is essentially everywhere, almost in the universe.
He's essentially in control of one of the four

587
00:50:29,672 --> 00:50:35,551
fundamental forces of the universe. Exactly.
This sucks. Okay, Harry and Tasker, cover your

588
00:50:35,631 --> 00:50:45,799
ears for a few seconds, because this is fucking
bullshit. Damn it. Okay, I'm done. Okay, you

589
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:49,362
can uncover your ears again. So go ahead and
mark this down as a win in the Marvel column

590
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:52,825
for Magneto, and go ahead and write into us
and let us know what you guys thought about

591
00:50:52,865 --> 00:50:58,350
this fight. That does it for this episode. Let's
hurry up and wrap this up, this is dumb. Our

592
00:50:58,390 --> 00:51:04,362
next episode, we will be reviewing Jessica Jones,
season three. Right, it's the very last of

593
00:51:04,382 --> 00:51:09,063
the Marvel Netflix shows that's going to air,
and so it's a little bit bittersweet, but the

594
00:51:09,303 --> 00:51:13,624
show has been pretty good consistently, even
with season two being not quite as good as

595
00:51:13,644 --> 00:51:17,746
season one. But I do like the character so much,
so I'm excited. So yeah, we'll be reviewing

596
00:51:17,786 --> 00:51:23,227
that. Go ahead and visit us at dynamicduel.com,
