1
00:00:03,283 --> 00:00:03,344
you

2
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,733
Welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:27,773 --> 00:00:33,237
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:33,677 --> 00:00:38,841
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother Marvelous
Joe. And happy Halloween, everyone! Yeah, happy

5
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:42,483
Halloween, which was, of course, yesterday.
But we're gonna keep it going for one more

6
00:00:42,523 --> 00:00:48,467
day with this Halloween-inspired duel episode,
Solomon Grundy vs. Werewolf by Night. And it's

7
00:00:48,487 --> 00:00:52,470
been a while since we've done a duel episode,
not since episode 300. where we play Young

8
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:57,412
Avengers vs Young Justice. So this will be fun
getting back to the duels. These characters

9
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:02,474
are pretty spooky. So hopefully you don't get
too scared listening to this. Before we get

10
00:01:02,494 --> 00:01:05,916
into the main events of this episode though,
we will be breaking down the comic book movie

11
00:01:05,996 --> 00:01:11,479
news from the past week, including the news
that James Gunn and Peter Safran have been

12
00:01:11,559 --> 00:01:16,921
chosen to lead DC Studios. Finally, I didn't
think it was gonna happen. We're gonna talk

13
00:01:16,981 --> 00:01:21,213
all about it. We're also going to talk about
the Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania official

14
00:01:21,253 --> 00:01:26,017
trailer, the Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday
Special official trailer, and the news that

to the no prize. A No Prize is an award Marvel

29
00:02:39,983 --> 00:02:45,107
used to give out up into the 90s to fans. Our
version, the Dynamic Duel No Prize, is a digital

30
00:02:45,187 --> 00:02:49,890
award that we post on Instagram for the person
that we feel gave the best answer to our question

31
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:55,955
of the week. Last week, in a question that immediately
became obsolete the day that episode dropped,

32
00:02:56,395 --> 00:03:02,379
we asked, whose vision of the DC film universe
are you most interested in? The Rocks, James

33
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:08,015
Gunn's, Matt Reeves, or JJ Abrams? When we asked
our question, the trades were reporting that

34
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:13,237
those four were competing for power and their
vision when it came to the DC film universe.

35
00:03:13,377 --> 00:03:17,479
Of course, as we'll be talking about later on,
James Gunn and Peter Safran have become the

36
00:03:17,499 --> 00:03:22,722
heads of DC Studios, but we saw some honorable
mentions to announce as well as the no prize

37
00:03:22,782 --> 00:03:27,064
winner. Our first honorable mention goes to
Eric Maizel, who said,

38
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:37,251
he's an outstanding director with fantastic
vision. I feel like he can do no wrong. I didn't

39
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:42,613
love what Abrams did with the Star Trek movies
and his universe has been abandoned. I didn't

40
00:03:42,633 --> 00:03:48,814
watch any of his Star Wars stuff because it's
Star Wars gross. I hadn't seen Black Adam or

41
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:54,596
anything fast or furious and the Batman was
just plain awful. So yeah, going with Gunn's

42
00:03:54,616 --> 00:03:59,677
vision for DC's future. Okay, there's a lot
of things that I disagree with in this honorable

43
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:06,260
mention. I do however agree that I'm not a fan
of JJ Abrams franchises that he's done with

44
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:11,942
like Star Trek with Star Wars. Of all of the
choices, he was my least favorite to kind of

45
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:17,705
take the reins of DC. To Eric's credit, he did
give this answer prior to the news breaking

46
00:04:17,765 --> 00:04:23,007
that James Gunn had become the new CEO of DC
Studios. He did see a lot of controversial

47
00:04:23,027 --> 00:04:30,050
things there, but I do agree that the Batman
sucked. So wrong, so wrong! Our next honorable

48
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:34,672
mention goes to Scott Camacho who said, For
the vision, I'm going to have to say Dwayne

49
00:04:34,712 --> 00:04:40,174
Johnson. I mean, come on, Johnny, the guy brought
a Superman back. But I believe by the time

50
00:04:40,594 --> 00:04:46,597
you guys get this recording, James Gunn and
Peter Saffron have been named co-CEOs for DC

51
00:04:46,617 --> 00:04:53,180
films. So let's bring on the Gunn era. Yeah,
I'm not going to lie. I was really looking

52
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:59,234
forward to what The Rock was going to have planned
for. the DC universe considering the fact that

53
00:04:59,314 --> 00:05:03,497
I really, really liked Black Adam. I thought
it was a lot of fun. Dwayne Johnson did bring

54
00:05:03,517 --> 00:05:07,959
back Henry Cavill, which was amazing. I can't
wait to see him as Superman again in future

55
00:05:07,999 --> 00:05:14,242
films. And I liked the idea of the justice league
and suicide squad and, you know, justice society

56
00:05:14,282 --> 00:05:18,504
and the Shazam family, everyone basically going
up against Black Adam, a little self-serving

57
00:05:18,704 --> 00:05:23,559
maybe, but I think the rock would have made
it really cool. Well, maybe Gunn will collaborate

58
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:27,461
with The Rock a little bit, so we'll still get
to see The Rock's vision. Yeah, that's my hope.

59
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:32,445
I mean, you can't just drop The Rock after making
one Black Adam film. Like, I would love to

60
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:38,409
see a sequel to that. Isn't that how that song
goes? You can't drop The Rock, can't drop The

61
00:05:38,489 --> 00:05:43,453
Rock. But no, yeah, we all need to tweet James
Gunn that song. He'll know what it means. I

62
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:47,495
think the actual lyrics are, you can't stop
The Rock. Oh, it's fine. Our next honorable

63
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:54,159
mention goes to Kevin O'dealon, who said...
Hi guys, the vision that I would like to see

64
00:05:54,219 --> 00:06:02,623
more will be the rocks vision because as a Marvel
fan I feel like DC movies, this is as good

65
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:08,685
a chance as they'll get to be as good as Marvel
movies. Sorry Johnny DC, but yeah, definitely

66
00:06:08,725 --> 00:06:14,508
a very enjoyable movie and I feel like continuity
wise I'll be good for the franchise which is

67
00:06:14,548 --> 00:06:20,326
a huge problem that DC movies have been having
and yeah, go Marvel. Go Marvel. I think that

68
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:26,330
really says it all. DC had one shot to be as
good as Marvel and they blew it by not picking

69
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:31,393
the Rock, according to Kevin O'dealon. Well,
I mean, the Suicide Squad was pretty damn good.

70
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:37,756
I would say that Black Adam was just as entertaining
as any Marvel movie more so. And yeah, I remember

71
00:06:38,157 --> 00:06:41,819
your first reaction to seeing the movie, Joseph,
was that it was the most Marvel movie that

72
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:45,961
DC has made. So if you're a fan of Marvel, I
could see where the Rock's vision really appeals

73
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:51,829
to you. We want to give a big shout out to Landon
Parker, Benjamin Ryan, Carson Miklis, and Oz

74
00:06:51,929 --> 00:06:55,352
for taking the time to visit our website and
leave their answers to our question of the

75
00:06:55,372 --> 00:07:00,015
week. We really appreciate you guys doing that.
But the winner of this week's snow prize is

76
00:07:00,636 --> 00:07:07,381
Dustin Belcom, who said, Hey Dynamic Duel, Dustin
Belcom here. And you can call this sucking

77
00:07:07,421 --> 00:07:12,344
up to the host or whatever you want, but it's
an honest answer. I want Johnny V's vision.

78
00:07:12,405 --> 00:07:12,765
I want...

79
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:22,921
put in the discord chat of his plan that he
was ahead. I want to join NGC all the way.

80
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:31,625
Okay, now Dustin is definitely sucking up here
and his answer is a little bit inside baseball

81
00:07:31,665 --> 00:07:37,070
because on our Discord chat server where all
the patrons hang out, Jonathan posted his vision

82
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,914
of what the DC Films franchise would look like
over the next 10 years or so. And yeah, it

83
00:07:41,954 --> 00:07:46,818
was pretty solid. Yeah, David Zazlov had mentioned
during the last investors meeting for Warner

84
00:07:46,838 --> 00:07:52,543
Brothers Discovery that he was looking for someone
with a 10 year plan. Well, I have one and I

85
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:56,962
think it's pretty awesome. If you wanna know
what it is, James Gunn. Just feel free to at

86
00:07:57,002 --> 00:08:01,984
me. I'm totally available to spitball ideas.
Yeah, James Gunn, you have to join our Patreon

87
00:08:02,024 --> 00:08:07,106
if you want to know what it is. If you're listening
to this. Become an executive producer. But

88
00:08:07,306 --> 00:08:11,608
I do have to say Dustin has a little bit of
brown on his nose. It is the best way to win

89
00:08:11,648 --> 00:08:17,770
a no prize. Like hands down. No, I am very honored
that he chose me to be the head of DC Studios.

90
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:23,373
Alas, I am not, but maybe someday. Until then,
thank you for submitting your answer. If you

91
00:08:23,393 --> 00:08:26,749
the listener want to try at winning your own
no prize. Stay tuned until later on in this

92
00:08:26,809 --> 00:08:31,322
episode when we'll be asking another Question
of the Week. And now that that's done, on to

93
00:08:31,342 --> 00:08:31,884
the news!

94
00:08:37,758 --> 00:08:44,544
Okay, so I will admit that this past year has
had a lot of highs and lows in terms of being

95
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:51,150
a DC fan. Just the fact that Warner Brothers
was bought by Discovery earlier this year,

96
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:54,793
and it really didn't seem like we had clear
leadership, or at least leadership that was

97
00:08:54,853 --> 00:09:01,659
willing to make a cohesive film cinematic universe,
a la Kevin Feige over at Marvel. I just like

98
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:07,951
suffered from so much anxiety this year. Being
a DC fan, but with the recent news that DC

99
00:09:07,971 --> 00:09:13,232
Studios now has a leader chosen by David Zaslav
or leaders I should say James Gunn and Peter

100
00:09:13,292 --> 00:09:19,574
Safran are going to be the new heads of DC Studios
and their job actually starts today November

101
00:09:19,714 --> 00:09:26,176
1st, it was huge news. I did not see this coming
I actually kind of lost hope but then out of

102
00:09:26,276 --> 00:09:31,877
nowhere we got the news about Gunn and Safran
and I felt really happy I felt like really

103
00:09:32,157 --> 00:09:38,205
happy I didn't expect them to take charge, but
looking at their past bodies of work, I think

104
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:43,028
DC Studios is in a really good place. I was
totally shocked by this news when I first heard

105
00:09:43,088 --> 00:09:48,671
it. I was a little bit embittered because I
consider James Gunn more of a Marvel guy, considering

106
00:09:48,711 --> 00:09:53,714
that he still has the Holiday Special for Guardians
of the Galaxy and Volume 3 coming out later

107
00:09:53,815 --> 00:10:00,302
on next spring. So he has all this insider Marvel
knowledge. and he's just gonna bring all of

108
00:10:00,322 --> 00:10:05,324
that to DC, which essentially means that DC
is ripping off Marvel once again. But of course,

109
00:10:05,344 --> 00:10:09,866
we also had the Suicide Squad from James Gunn,
which was fantastic, and we had Peacemaker,

110
00:10:10,026 --> 00:10:14,788
which was amazing. Like, that show was way better
than I thought it was going to be. But on the

111
00:10:14,808 --> 00:10:19,530
production side, we also have Peter Safran,
who was the producer for Aquaman, which grossed

112
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:24,672
over a billion dollars and is DC's most successful,
highest-grossing film of all time. And we also

113
00:10:24,692 --> 00:10:30,088
have Shazam, which I loved. I loved that movie.
He produced the Suicide Squad, and he's bringing

114
00:10:30,168 --> 00:10:35,012
us the Shazam and Aquaman sequels along with
Blue Beetle. He's a really good producer. I

115
00:10:35,032 --> 00:10:40,377
guess initially Zezlov wanted Safran to take
the role of the CEO of DC Studios entirely,

116
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:45,622
but Safran was unwilling to do it unless he
had creative support. And since James Gunn

117
00:10:45,682 --> 00:10:50,170
is a writer and a director, Safran pitched that
the two of them would lead together. Yeah,

118
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:54,513
it kind of surprises me that they both have
the title of CEO. What they have does seem

119
00:10:54,553 --> 00:11:00,116
similar to the structure that they have at Pixar
studios, which is owned by Disney, where Jim

120
00:11:00,156 --> 00:11:06,241
Morris is the CEO, but John Lasseter is the
CCO, chief creative officer. And you would

121
00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:11,124
think that Gunn would have taken on the CCO
role as opposed to CEO. Yeah, it is pretty

122
00:11:11,144 --> 00:11:16,348
interesting. I don't know what kind of, you
know, administration background that James

123
00:11:16,368 --> 00:11:22,865
Gunn has, but yeah, both Gunn and Safran. are
co-chairs and co-CEOs of DC Studios, which

124
00:11:22,905 --> 00:11:28,470
is a newly formed division at Warner Brothers,
and that's going to replace DC Films. As co-chairs

125
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:34,054
and co-CEOs, James Gunn and Peter Safran are
in charge of not only films and television,

126
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:40,560
but animation as well, except for Todd Phillips'
Joker film, and the word is still out on the

127
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,464
sequel for Matt Reeves, The Batman. What do
you think James Gunn and Peter Safran's taking

128
00:11:45,564 --> 00:11:51,388
over of DC studios means for the future of DC
movies? That's hard to answer. I gotta say

129
00:11:51,408 --> 00:11:55,931
at the very least they're all gonna have badass
soundtracks. And I imagine they're gonna play

130
00:11:56,011 --> 00:12:02,316
out a lot like Aquaman and Shazam and The Suicide
Squad, just really fun films. And it kind of

131
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:08,040
seems like they're gonna continue the continuity
established by the DCEU. Like Henry Cavill

132
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,831
is still Superman, Gal Gadot is still Wonder
Woman. All of that doesn't seem like it's going

133
00:12:11,871 --> 00:12:15,894
to change. Peacemaker is in that universe as
well, along with Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn.

134
00:12:16,034 --> 00:12:20,618
All of those characters, I think, are gonna
stay in their roles. And instead of rebooting

135
00:12:20,778 --> 00:12:25,943
anything, my guess is that James Gunn is just
gonna keep building out this universe. Although

136
00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:31,788
I guess I should say it's no longer called the
DCEU, it's now just the DCU. Which is a total

137
00:12:31,828 --> 00:12:35,932
ripoff of the MCU. I do think it's gonna get
a little bit confusing when you're referring

138
00:12:35,952 --> 00:12:42,455
to the comic universe or like the... DC Universe
Infinite app or the cinematic movie universe

139
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:46,897
now. We're going to have to come up with some
new acronyms pretty soon. But yeah, look, something

140
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:53,100
new. Something's already changed. Gunn and Saffron
are doing new things at DC and it's really

141
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,861
exciting. But this brings us to our question
of the week.

142

6th. In Marvel news we got the long-awaited

148
00:13:30,591 --> 00:13:36,154
official trailer for Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania.
It was an amazing trailer. It looks like a

149
00:13:36,254 --> 00:13:41,277
really fun movie. It was really cool. Like I
think this is the coolest Ant-Man has ever

150
00:13:41,337 --> 00:13:45,159
looked. It's definitely taking the franchise
places that it's never been. You know the first

151
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,242
two Ant-Man movies were heist films that took
place largely on Earth. We did briefly visit

152
00:13:50,282 --> 00:13:55,145
the Quantum Realm in the last movie but it looks
like most of this movie is going to take place

153
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:59,628
in the Quantum Realm. where we get to see all
the weirdness that takes place in the universe

154
00:13:59,768 --> 00:14:05,393
down at the subatomic level. I don't know if
Marvel is referencing the Microverse or the

155
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:11,137
Cosmos dimension within this trailer, but it
looks very like Guardians of the Galaxy, Star

156
00:14:11,157 --> 00:14:16,201
Wars-ish. Totally. And I think that can only
be a good thing for the Ant-Man and the Wasp

157
00:14:16,281 --> 00:14:20,855
franchise. Of course the trailer starts out
with a lot of jokes, basically Ant-Man talking

158
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:25,556
about how cool it is to be an Avenger and how
he gets cheered on by people in the street

159
00:14:25,576 --> 00:14:31,018
who are like, thank you, Spider-Man. I thought
that was a really solid joke. And it paid off

160
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:36,019
later on in the trailer as well. Yeah. You know,
like everyone may not recognize him as Ant-Man,

161
00:14:36,139 --> 00:14:43,101
but guess who does? Fucking Kang. Kang the Conqueror,
yeah. We see that Cassie, who is aged up now

162
00:14:43,221 --> 00:14:47,845
after the events of... Avengers Infinity War
where she didn't get blipped and the rest of

163
00:14:47,865 --> 00:14:52,850
her family did. She's doing some science stuff
just like her grandfather and her dad. She

164
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:58,315
creates a beacon into the quantum realm to check
on how things are going down there. Of course

165
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:03,240
this freaks out Janet Van Dyne who has spent
a large part of her life in the quantum realm

166
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,965
and knows about the dangers there. They all
get sucked into it and that's where this adventure

167
00:15:07,985 --> 00:15:13,683
takes place. Now this is a different actress
from the one that appeared in Endgame, correct?

168
00:15:13,964 --> 00:15:18,906
Yeah, in Endgame she was played by Emma Furman,
but in this upcoming movie it's gonna be Katherine

169
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:23,067
Newton. And I have to say, I think Katherine
does a pretty good job here. I like her delivery

170
00:15:23,207 --> 00:15:26,409
on these lines that she gives. Yeah, she's a
pretty good actress. I haven't seen her in

171
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:30,931
too much. I did see her in the movie Freaky,
but she was great in that. The music that plays

172
00:15:30,951 --> 00:15:34,372
in the background of the Quantum Realm scenes
is Goodbye Yellow

173
00:15:38,374 --> 00:15:42,917
Oh yeah, and it just kind of alludes to the
fact that they're going somewhere just wild

174
00:15:42,937 --> 00:15:46,879
and fantastic, kind of like Oz. I loved how
they took parts of the song and made like a

175
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:51,943
synth sound out of it. It sounded really cool.
It did. There was this one shot where it looks

176
00:15:51,983 --> 00:15:55,285
like they're almost in a Star Wars cantina.
I thought that was pretty cool. Yeah. It'll

177
00:15:55,305 --> 00:15:59,368
be interesting to see who they meet down there.
Of course, we do get a glimpse of Bill Murray.

178
00:15:59,628 --> 00:16:03,711
Yeah, a lot of the technology we see in this
trailer, though, has caught a lot of people's

179
00:16:03,731 --> 00:16:10,127
attention because it looks very reminiscent
of what we see. like on Shang-Chi's 10 rings

180
00:16:10,527 --> 00:16:15,730
and on the bangle that Miss Marvel wears. Which
we theorized was a nega-band. Yeah, yeah, but

181
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:21,633
I almost wonder now if it was like technology
that Kang developed. Oh, that's possible. I

182
00:16:21,673 --> 00:16:26,516
think the costume that they gave Jonathan Majors
as Kang the Conqueror was spot on. It looks

183
00:16:26,576 --> 00:16:32,799
really cool. I like how they translated Kang's
blue face as more of a blue light screen that

184
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:37,462
goes over his face. Yeah, yeah. That was a nice
touch. I really like that. Overall, he seems

185
00:16:37,482 --> 00:16:42,304
to be playing a much different character than
he who remains at the end of the Loki television

186
00:16:42,345 --> 00:16:47,868
series. Jonathan Majors is just a chameleon
of an actor. Yeah, and this version has scars

187
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:51,930
on his face. Yeah. Which is interesting. Like
the mask that he wears in the comics. They

188
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:56,612
do a pretty good job of setting him up as a
threat. Now, we know that Kang is going to

189
00:16:56,632 --> 00:17:01,955
appear again in Avengers the Kang Dynasty because
that movie was announced at the last D23. It

190
00:17:01,975 --> 00:17:06,682
looks like this movie is more setting up Kang
than actually fighting and defeating him. And

191
00:17:06,702 --> 00:17:12,088
to that end, I really like how this movie seems
to be displaying him as this force to be reckoned

192
00:17:12,108 --> 00:17:16,272
with, just like by the look that Paul Rudd gives
him. I think that was a pretty good performance

193
00:17:16,312 --> 00:17:20,537
on his end. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that was great.
I really love how they didn't end this trailer

194
00:17:20,737 --> 00:17:25,522
on a joke. It was a very serious moment. And
that feeling just kind of stayed with you even

195
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:29,727
when the trailer was done. They didn't ruin
it with bathos. This movie overall is gonna

196
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:34,352
be one of my more anticipated Marvel movies
really continuing the story that was left off

197
00:17:34,372 --> 00:17:39,457
from Avengers Endgame, which a lot of phase
four really hasn't done too much of. But since

198
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:43,101
Quantumania kicks off phase five, I think it's
really gonna take us in this new direction

199
00:17:43,321 --> 00:17:46,985
for the MCU. Yeah, yeah, I'm looking forward
to it. It kind of feels like we're going back

200
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:52,070
to the Marvel that we know and love. Yeah. Not
me though. You love it, you love it. You know

201
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:56,235
what else you'll love? You'll love the Guardians
of the Galaxy Holiday Special, which we also

202
00:17:56,275 --> 00:18:01,582
got a trailer for this past week. Dude, I'm
gonna love anything James Gunn, henceforth.

203
00:18:01,902 --> 00:18:06,648
It's gonna be the best stuff. Now the special
for Werewolf by Night was only an hour long.

204
00:18:06,728 --> 00:18:11,534
I'm assuming that this holiday special is going
to be of a comparable length. In its- We see

205
00:18:11,594 --> 00:18:17,776
that Peter Quill Star-Lord is down in the dumps
due to Gamora leaving him. Of course, this

206
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:21,557
is the Gamora that he doesn't have a history
with because that one died by the hands of

207
00:18:21,597 --> 00:18:27,959
Thanos. This new Gamora was time displaced into
the main MCU timeline and I guess she doesn't

208
00:18:27,979 --> 00:18:32,620
really want to have anything to do with him.
So with the Earth holiday of Christmas approaching,

209
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,422
the Guardians of the Galaxy decide to kind of
do something special for Star-Lord. Part of

210
00:18:37,442 --> 00:18:44,906
their plan is to travel to Earth to kidnap the
legendary Kevin Bacon and present him to Star-Lord

211
00:18:45,046 --> 00:18:49,188
as a Christmas present. Now I'm sure that's
not what the whole plot of the special is,

212
00:18:49,468 --> 00:18:54,551
probably just a side plot with Mantis and Drax,
but already this thing is shaping up to be

213
00:18:54,751 --> 00:19:00,074
hilarious. I really love Drax's delivery when
he tells Kevin Bacon, he's like so excited,

214
00:19:00,094 --> 00:19:04,257
he's like you're coming with us as a Christmas
present. Like that makes it okay, you know?

215
00:19:05,618 --> 00:19:09,922
And to see Kevin Bacon in this was so shocking.
Like I was not expecting that. Yeah, I love

216
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:15,869
how the credits were like, and introducing Kevin
Bacon. Yeah. Of course, Kevin Bacon was referenced

217
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:21,515
in the first Guardians movie as one of the major
heroes of Earth. He was the guy who taught

218
00:19:21,555 --> 00:19:26,501
all the people with the sticks up their butts
how to relax and dance. You know? So cool that

219
00:19:26,521 --> 00:19:31,489
he's in this. And it'll be so interesting to
see like how the real world interacts with

220
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:36,533
the zany world from James Gunn's Guardians of
the Galaxy franchise. Yeah, yeah, totally.

221
00:19:36,933 --> 00:19:42,618
I noticed Cosmo is also credited in this trailer.
Yeah, I can't remember who does the voice for

222
00:19:42,758 --> 00:19:46,761
Cosmo, but of course Cosmo will have a Russian
accent and maybe he'll find his way back to

223
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:51,345
Earth. I don't know. I was also surprised at
how different Groot looks like now that he's

224
00:19:51,445 --> 00:19:57,422
older. Yeah, that was pretty weird, right? He
looks much more bulky, I would say. His head

225
00:19:57,482 --> 00:20:02,286
is still pretty small. Not as tall as it was
from the first movie. It almost looks like

226
00:20:02,647 --> 00:20:07,631
it's live action now. Like they got a guy in
a costume and they're CGing the face. It does

227
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:10,834
kind of look like that, doesn't it? Yeah, maybe
it's cheaper that way. Maybe they're saying

228
00:20:10,874 --> 00:20:15,818
that Groot is bulking up or something in his
late teens. By this point, I'm hoping that

229
00:20:16,018 --> 00:20:20,258
he'll be adult Groot again because he's been
growing for quite a while. I think one of the

230
00:20:20,298 --> 00:20:24,201
more surprising things that was announced for
this trailer was that the special is coming

231
00:20:24,261 --> 00:20:29,544
out really soon in less than a month. It'll
be debuting on the Disney Plus channel on November

232
00:20:29,604 --> 00:20:35,108
25th, which is the day after Thanksgiving in
the US. Yeah, I mean, just to touch on the

233
00:20:35,148 --> 00:20:40,812
James Gunn taking over for DC News real quick
one more time. I'm really curious to see how

234
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:46,216
they plan on promoting these upcoming Guardians
of the Galaxy films, this holiday special and

235
00:20:46,256 --> 00:20:50,170
Guardians of the Galaxy volume three without
James Gunn. because of course he's not going

236
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:54,852
to be able to work for the competition. Exactly.
They probably have some clause in his contract

237
00:20:54,892 --> 00:21:00,034
that says he has to finish his contract with
Marvel in the promotion and post-production

238
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:05,096
of the Guardians movies, and then from then
on he has to work for DC exclusively and can

239
00:21:05,136 --> 00:21:08,837
no longer work for Marvel. I don't even know
about that. I think they might just have someone

240
00:21:08,937 --> 00:21:14,500
else wrap up post-production on volume 3, and
maybe he'll do no promotional work for the

241
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:18,421
holiday special. I mean, they have actors for
that. Yeah, that could happen as well. We'll

242
00:21:18,441 --> 00:21:23,292
have to see. But in the last bit of Marvel news,
also dealing with the Disney Plus platform,

243
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:28,935
we learned this past week that a new Marvel
series focusing on Vision will be coming out.

244
00:21:29,035 --> 00:21:33,597
It'll be called Vision Quest, which is a name
that I don't love, but it is really awesome

245
00:21:33,717 --> 00:21:38,980
to see that Vision is coming back after his
last appearance in WandaVision. I actually

246
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:43,583
like that name a lot, because it's like another
pun, kind of like WandaVision. Why don't they

247
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:50,398
just call this Vision then, or The Vision? Because
he's going on a quest, bro. Okay. I was kind

248
00:21:50,418 --> 00:21:55,200
of hoping they would do something like Tom King's
story where he gets his own family That would

249
00:21:55,220 --> 00:22:00,783
have felt like a much more direct sequel to
WandaVision. I think this show might go that

250
00:22:00,843 --> 00:22:06,325
route I think it'll deal more with visions journey
back to humanity as a worry, you know He was

251
00:22:06,385 --> 00:22:11,047
never human but now he's just the shell of what
he once was when he was the wielder of the

252
00:22:11,087 --> 00:22:15,429
mind stone Hopefully he comes back to the vision
that we know and love through the course of

253
00:22:15,449 --> 00:22:20,713
this show Deadline did suggest that there was
a possibility for Wanda Maximoff to appear

254
00:22:20,913 --> 00:22:25,437
in this series, but since we figured that she
allegedly died in the Multiverse of Madness

255
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:28,980
movie, it's hard to know whether or not that's
the case. Of course, they could always find

256
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,462
a way to bring her back. I think they're going
to bring her back even earlier than Vision

257
00:22:32,502 --> 00:22:37,666
Quest. I think we'll see her in Agatha, Covenant
of Chaos. You think so? That's my guess. I

258
00:22:37,686 --> 00:22:41,269
think that's why they changed the name of it.
I mean, it used to be called House of Harkness.

259
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:45,833
But now they're talking about Chaos Magic. I
think it's a huge telegraph. That's not a bad

260
00:22:46,013 --> 00:22:50,196
theory, for sure. There's not much more news
regarding Vision Quest. We don't know when

261
00:22:50,256 --> 00:22:54,599
it's coming out. It likely won't be debuting
on the platform for the next couple of years,

262
00:22:54,719 --> 00:22:59,042
but it is exciting that Paul Bettany is coming
back. But I think that does it for the news

263
00:22:59,122 --> 00:23:03,646
for this episode. Let's move on to the main
event, where we find out who would win in a

264
00:23:03,726 --> 00:23:08,709
duel between the zombie monster, Solomon Grundy,
and the werewolf by night.

265
00:23:24,034 --> 00:23:30,757
Okay, Solomon Grundy versus werewolf by night.
Again, we're doing this as a tie into Halloween,

266
00:23:30,797 --> 00:23:35,959
the holiday that was yesterday and the whole
spooky season around it. Solomon Grundy, if

267
00:23:35,979 --> 00:23:40,922
you're not familiar with him, he is originally
a Green Lantern villain who is this reanimated

268
00:23:41,082 --> 00:23:46,985
swamp zombie monster. Kind of like Swamp Thing,
but not. Yeah, semi-related to Swamp Thing,

269
00:23:47,005 --> 00:23:52,567
you'll find out in the bio. Werewolf by Night,
of course, recently had his own special debut

270
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:59,009
on Disney Plus. It was Marvel's Halloween special.
And once we saw how awesome that short film

271
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:03,130
was, we knew that we had to get the character
in a dual episode. Yeah, and it doesn't get

272
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:08,311
more Halloween than a werewolf versus a zombie.
And werewolf by night has fought zombies in

273
00:24:08,351 --> 00:24:13,253
the past, the Marvel zombies, with the Midnight
Sons. So I just got to say, Solomon Grundy's

274
00:24:13,273 --> 00:24:17,784
going down. What do you think, huh? Mm-hmm.
Well, let's find out! If you've never listened

275
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:22,448
to one of our duel episodes before, the way
we determine a winner between these two characters

276
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:28,394
is by running 1000 Monte Carlo simulations using
their statistics. A Monte Carlo simulation

277
00:24:28,474 --> 00:24:33,659
is a probabilistic model used to determine outcomes
through random sampling. And in our case it

278
00:24:33,699 --> 00:24:38,344
randomizes statistics along a normal distribution,
which is a bell curve, as a way to simulate

279
00:24:38,364 --> 00:24:42,659
the many variables that can occur during battle.
The stat parameters we use are based on the

280
00:24:42,699 --> 00:24:47,363
official Marvel power grid, and we use that
criteria to extrapolate the DC character stats.

281
00:24:47,623 --> 00:24:52,006
We've included some additional stat categories
of our own, such as range, damage potential,

282
00:24:52,046 --> 00:24:57,390
versatility, and perception, in order to create
a more complete and robust simulation. Running

283
00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:02,294
these 1000 simulations gives us a percentage
of wins for each character, and we declare

284
00:25:02,314 --> 00:25:06,016
the one with the higher percentage to be the
ultimate victor, considering that they're more

285
00:25:06,056 --> 00:25:11,436
likely to win any given battle. No character
ever wins 100% of the time, comics have shown

286
00:25:11,456 --> 00:25:16,239
that there's usually a way for Batman to defeat
Superman. And we feel our method falls in line

287
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:20,422
with the precedents that have been established
in the comic book stories. And we use this

288
00:25:20,462 --> 00:25:25,025
method because it was the least subjective,
most unbiased way to determine who would win.

289
00:25:25,466 --> 00:25:30,249
Of course, we are both heavily biased toward
our respective allegiances, so instead of debating

290
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:34,912
these matches forever, we just let the math
decide for us. There are no fan votes here,

291
00:25:35,192 --> 00:25:39,632
and no relying on just feats. Before we run
the simulations though, we like to break down

292
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:44,876
each character's histories and abilities before
improvising a scenario on how we imagine one

293
00:25:44,916 --> 00:25:49,680
of the 1000 simulations we run would play out
beat for beat. And I believe it's your turn

294
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:55,045
to go first with the Marvel characters backstory.
Let me go ahead and tell you the spooky backstory

295
00:25:55,345 --> 00:26:02,291
of Werewolf by Night. Centuries ago, in the
late 1700s, a Transylvanian man named Grigori

296
00:26:02,331 --> 00:26:07,834
Russov refused to bow before the ruler of the
lands Vlad Tepes, who was also the immortal

297
00:26:07,874 --> 00:26:14,476
supernatural being Dracula. For his insolence,
Dracula killed Grigori's wife. In revenge,

298
00:26:14,736 --> 00:26:20,397
Grigori attacked Dracula, seemingly killing
him with a stake through the heart, but Grigori

299
00:26:20,437 --> 00:26:26,079
was then bitten by a werewolf that was in the
vampire's service, forever inflicting Grigori

300
00:26:26,239 --> 00:26:32,221
and his family line with the curse of werewolfism.
Generations later, in the Russov Castle estate

301
00:26:32,281 --> 00:26:38,082
in Transylvania, Grigori Russov's descendant
Gregor, and the American woman named Laura,

302
00:26:38,182 --> 00:26:44,864
conceived two children, Jacob and Lyssa. Every
full moon, in secret, Gregor would lock himself

303
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:50,406
away in the castle's keep to protect others
from harm. Yet one stormy evening, a bolt of

304
00:26:50,446 --> 00:26:55,687
lightning destroyed a section of the keep's
walls, and Gregor, in his wild werewolf form,

305
00:26:56,027 --> 00:27:02,129
escaped and terrorized some of the local villagers.
The townspeople, armed with silver bullets,

306
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:07,505
shot and killed Gregor. and the Russo family
was driven from their castle, with Laura taking

307
00:27:07,545 --> 00:27:13,310
her children to America and changing her last
name to Russell. The children, Jacob and Lissa,

308
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:19,255
eventually forgot the events of that night due
to their young age. 15 years later, Jacob,

309
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:25,881
AKA Jack Russell, celebrated his 18th birthday
when he unknowingly inherited the curse of

310
00:27:25,921 --> 00:27:31,305
werewolfism and changed for the first time by
the light of the full moon. The day after,

311
00:27:31,626 --> 00:27:36,309
His mother, Laura, who at the time had been
fatally injured in a car crash, admitted to

312
00:27:36,349 --> 00:27:42,233
Jacob on her deathbed about his father's past
and the Russoff curse. In an attempt to find

313
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:48,137
a cure, Jack learned about the Darkhold, a magical
book of dark spells. Despite going through

314
00:27:48,157 --> 00:27:53,041
many adventures acquiring the book and taking
it to a priest to read, the book possessed

315
00:27:53,141 --> 00:27:57,884
the clergyman and Jack was forced to fight him
in a battle that ended with the Darkhold vanished

316
00:27:57,924 --> 00:28:04,665
from sight. Jack became a lonely drifter traveling
the world, ending up in his father's homeland

317
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:10,069
of Transylvania. There he discovered a copy
of the Darkhold and fought Dracula over it,

318
00:28:10,269 --> 00:28:16,013
though the book ended up lost in the Alps Mountains.
Over the years, Jack teamed up with Frankenstein's

319
00:28:16,053 --> 00:28:21,077
monster to battle a satanic cult that had kidnapped
his sister, he fought against Morbius, the

320
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:26,701
living vampire anti-hero, and he teamed up with
the hero Tigra against the villainous organization

321
00:28:26,781 --> 00:28:32,319
Hydra. Eventually, the group of aristocratic
criminals known as the Committee tracked Jack

322
00:28:32,359 --> 00:28:37,140
down. The Committee was revealed to be behind
the car accident that killed Jack's mother,

323
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,442
Laura, and they hired the mercenary Moon Knight
to attack Jack, with their ultimate goal being

324
00:28:42,482 --> 00:28:47,503
to capture and control the werewolf for use
in their own nefarious schemes. You can learn

325
00:28:47,523 --> 00:28:52,004
more about Moon Knight in our Batman vs. Moon
Knight duel episode. Moon Knight learned about

326
00:28:52,044 --> 00:28:56,485
the Committee's criminal intent, however, and
he and Jack teamed up to take the Committee

327
00:28:56,525 --> 00:29:02,121
down. Jack also teamed up with his reluctant
rival Morbius, the swamp creature Manthing,

328
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:06,944
and the demon possessed hero Ghost Rider to
form the Legion of Monsters team, though they

329
00:29:07,004 --> 00:29:11,728
tragically soon disbanded after accidentally
killing a benevolent entity called the Starseed.

330
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:16,491
You can learn more about Ghost Rider, Manthing,
and Morbius in their respective duel episodes

331
00:29:16,551 --> 00:29:21,775
against Etrigen, Swampthing, and Manbat. Through
all of this, Jack retained his human mind while

332
00:29:21,815 --> 00:29:26,674
in the werewolves form, but was never fully
in control of his actions. During an adventure

333
00:29:26,714 --> 00:29:32,235
alongside Brother Voodoo, Jack managed to gain
control of when he transformed, though it could

334
00:29:32,315 --> 00:29:37,237
only be under moonlight and he would still lose
control during the full moon. Because of his

335
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:41,698
greater control, he was able to team up with
less supernatural heroes such as Iron Man and

336
00:29:41,758 --> 00:29:46,779
Spider Woman against the sorceress Morgan Le
Fay. After managing to contact the spirit of

337
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:52,161
his father Gregor and battling a cult of werewolves
that had been turned by Jack in the past, Jack

338
00:29:52,201 --> 00:29:57,282
gained full control of his werewolf self and
his transformation. Despite this, he still

339
00:29:57,322 --> 00:30:02,184
kept his distance as a lone wanderer and ventured
up to Canada where he fought both the mutant

340
00:30:02,224 --> 00:30:08,647
Sabretooth and the Wendigo in the Canadian Northwoods.
Later, Jack was captured by a villain called

341
00:30:08,747 --> 00:30:14,710
the Demon Druid and his blood was used to create
a werewolf serum. This serum was used on Captain

342
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:20,572
America, turning him into Cap Wolf, who was
able to free Jack and other werewolves including

343
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:25,592
Jade Jonah Jameson's son, John Jameson. also
known as Man-Wolf who was an astronaut that

344
00:30:25,612 --> 00:30:30,657
was turned into a wolf by the other dimensional
moonstone pendant. And there was also Wolf-Spain,

345
00:30:30,938 --> 00:30:35,462
a mutant and member of the New Mutants team.
Damn, there's a lot of werewolves in Marvel!

346
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:41,949
Together, they all teamed up and defeated Demon
Druid. Jack was later slain by the vampire

347
00:30:41,989 --> 00:30:46,906
hunter Blade, who at the time was called Switchblade
and driven mad by the Darkhold. Jack was soon

348
00:30:46,966 --> 00:30:51,347
resurrected though when the effects of the Darkhold
spell on Blade were reversed by the supernatural

349
00:30:51,387 --> 00:30:55,308
heroes called the Midnight Suns, whom you can
learn more about in our Justice League Dark

350
00:30:55,348 --> 00:31:00,809
vs. Midnight Suns dual episode. Upon Jack's
return, he had lost the control of his werewolf

351
00:31:00,829 --> 00:31:05,551
form that he had gained earlier, and he resorted
to locking himself in a cage during the full

352
00:31:05,611 --> 00:31:11,432
moon. He learns that in order to regain control,
he needed to acquire the three pieces of the

353
00:31:11,492 --> 00:31:18,582
Wolf's Blade, an ancient mystical artifact.
Jack was transported to a branch of Hell where

354
00:31:18,622 --> 00:31:24,864
he battled the original wolf demon, Varkolok,
and he regained control. Jack's niece, who

355
00:31:24,904 --> 00:31:30,105
had become a vampire, was taken into the custody
of SHIELD, the international law enforcement

356
00:31:30,165 --> 00:31:35,147
organization. When Jack tried to break her out
of their custody, the two were recruited into

357
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:40,568
the Hellling Commandos, SHIELD's own monster
squad named after Nick Fury's original band

358
00:31:40,688 --> 00:31:46,050
of World War II heroes. Oh, it's like the Creature
Commandos. Right. Later released, Jack was

359
00:31:46,090 --> 00:31:51,094
brought by Morbius into the Midnight Suns to
fight against a zombie plague, and later joined

360
00:31:51,194 --> 00:31:56,598
a new iteration of the Legion of Monsters alongside
the monster hunter Elsa Bloodstone, whom Jack

361
00:31:56,658 --> 00:32:02,262
briefly dated. Recently, Jack helped protect
his former werewolf ally Wolfsbane after the

362
00:32:02,282 --> 00:32:07,686
birth of her newborn child, Slash Cub. A new
werewolf finite character was introduced in

363
00:32:07,746 --> 00:32:14,458
2020, this time a teenager of Hopi Native American
descent named Jake Gomez, who also came from

364
00:32:14,498 --> 00:32:19,680
a cursed family. He stopped life pharmaceuticals
from kidnapping and experimenting on natives

365
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:24,282
from the Hopi reservation. However, outside
of his own mini-series, he hasn't shown up

366
00:32:24,322 --> 00:32:30,264
again except once or twice. Powers-wise, Werewolf
by Night is a lycanthrope, able to turn into

367
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:35,647
a wolf retaining his normal human intelligence
and resembling a wolf-man hybrid. Under the

368
00:32:35,687 --> 00:32:41,009
full moon though, he transforms against his
will, turns wild, and resembles more of a wolf.

369
00:32:42,734 --> 00:32:48,157
He has similar powers gaining superhuman strength,
able to lift around one ton, speed fast enough

370
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:54,580
to be a blur in short bursts, durability, agility,
and enhanced senses including smell, hearing,

371
00:32:54,780 --> 00:33:00,724
and night vision. His claws and fangs are sharp
enough to rend stone and soft metals. Werewolf

372
00:33:00,784 --> 00:33:05,327
by night has a vast healing factor that is ten
times faster than humans, and he is nearly

373
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:11,250
impossible to kill, even surviving decapitation.
The only thing that can kill him... are weapons

374
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:17,234
made from his soul weakness, silver, due to
its mystical purity. Jack's mind, often within

375
00:33:17,254 --> 00:33:22,258
the werewolf form, is well-versed in occult
knowledge. And that's werewolf finite. But

376
00:33:22,278 --> 00:33:27,482
that's only when he's in control, right? Right.
So is he like stronger and faster and stuff

377
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:31,965
during the full moon? Yeah, it kind of waxes
and wanes similar to how moon knights does.

378
00:33:32,346 --> 00:33:36,589
At the height of a full moon, he's been shown
to lift things that are like two tons. So it's

379
00:33:36,629 --> 00:33:40,764
kind of fair to assume that- like his abilities
double in their effectiveness when he's in

380
00:33:40,804 --> 00:33:45,248
full wolf mode. Only two tons, huh? Hmm. That
doesn't matter, I mean, does Solomon Grundy

381
00:33:45,308 --> 00:33:52,014
weigh more than two tons? I doubt that. He's
mostly made of shit. Hahahaha. Swamp shit,

382
00:33:52,054 --> 00:33:57,478
sure. I think though you'll come to have a newfound
respect for Solomon Grundy. New respect and

383
00:33:57,538 --> 00:34:02,983
fear after I get through his backstory. No,
I won't. Let me get into it. Several miles

384
00:34:03,123 --> 00:34:09,500
outside of Gotham City in the suburb of Somerset,
exists Slaughter Swamp, where a wealthy yet

385
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:16,146
despised gentleman named Cyrus Gold was murdered
in the late 19th century. No one knew why Cyrus

386
00:34:16,186 --> 00:34:22,051
was murdered or who murdered him. It was rumored
that Cyrus was the father of a prostitute's

387
00:34:22,111 --> 00:34:27,095
child and was killed by her pimp when he refused
to give into their blackmail and extortion.

388
00:34:27,436 --> 00:34:32,119
Whatever the circumstances of his death, the
Parliament of Trees, which you can learn more

389
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:37,399
about in our Swamp Thing vs Man Thing episode,
attempted to turn him into the next Swamp Thing,

390
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:43,564
an avatar of the green, though the mystic process
was unsuccessful since Cyrus had not died by

391
00:34:43,644 --> 00:34:49,328
fire. Whether due to the Parliament of Tree's
interference or some other supernatural reason,

392
00:34:49,748 --> 00:34:56,473
the mostly decayed body of Cyrus Gold, now primarily
composed of swamp and plant matter, was resurrected

393
00:34:56,613 --> 00:35:03,558
nearly 50 years later as a giant beastly man
with no memory of who he was. After stumbling

394
00:35:03,638 --> 00:35:09,141
on two criminals hiding out in the swamp, Cyrus
killed them in his confusion and stole their

395
00:35:09,181 --> 00:35:15,244
clothes, making his way eventually to a hobo
camp on the outskirts of the swamp. When asked

396
00:35:15,284 --> 00:35:20,407
his name, Cyrus could respond only with the
one thing he remembered about himself, that

397
00:35:20,447 --> 00:35:25,670
he was born on a Monday. When one of the men
in the camp brought up the nursery rhyme Solomon

398
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:32,334
Grundy, that became Cyrus' nickname. Strong
yet mindless and easily manipulated, Grundy

399
00:35:32,354 --> 00:35:37,116
was ushered into a life of crime, and it wasn't
long before he was confronted by the Golden

400
00:35:37,216 --> 00:35:42,399
Age Green Lantern, Alan Scott, who you can learn
more about in our Green Lantern vs Iceman duel

401
00:35:42,439 --> 00:35:47,842
episode. Alan Scott's Green Lantern ring was
weak to the element of wood, and because of

402
00:35:47,882 --> 00:35:52,925
Grundy's body composition, he was immune to
Green Lantern's energy constructs, making him

403
00:35:52,945 --> 00:35:58,768
a formidable foe for the hero. Still, Green
Lantern managed to use his wits to kill Grundy,

404
00:35:59,008 --> 00:36:04,956
hurtling him in front of a train. Cursed with
continual zombie resurrection, however, Grundy

405
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:10,019
returned from the dead, oftentimes with new
personalities, levels of intelligence, and

406
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:15,202
sometimes powers. Eventually, Grundy became
much more of a threat than Green Lantern could

407
00:36:15,242 --> 00:36:20,405
handle alone, and after taking on the entire
Justice Society on several occasions, Grundy

408
00:36:20,425 --> 00:36:24,907
was often stranded on distant planets or in
Earth's orbit. You can learn more about the

409
00:36:24,927 --> 00:36:30,891
Justice Society in our JSA vs. Fantastic Four
team duel. Once, while trapped in a magic bubble

410
00:36:30,931 --> 00:36:36,534
created by Dr. Fate, Solomon Grundy was able
to absorb some of that magic and was transported

411
00:36:36,594 --> 00:36:42,817
to a parallel Earth. He later battled the combined
might of both the Justice Society and the Justice

412
00:36:42,877 --> 00:36:48,280
League in Slaughter Swamp, though it was defeated
and sealed there for a time. After battles

413
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,764
with Superman and Swamp Thing, Grundy took something
of a heroic turn for a time after he was rescued

414
00:36:53,784 --> 00:36:59,131
from a glacier by Ellen Scott's daughter, the
hero Jade. and he became an ally of her team,

415
00:36:59,271 --> 00:37:05,237
Infinity Inc. This was undone, however, after
the villain named Harley Quinn, not to be confused

416
00:37:05,277 --> 00:37:10,862
with Harley Quinn, used her powers of illusion
to fool Solomon Grundy into attacking Infinity

417
00:37:11,002 --> 00:37:16,847
Inc, and unwittingly led to the death of Skyman.
After the crisis on Infinite Earths merged

418
00:37:16,947 --> 00:37:22,492
the multiverse, Grundy next appeared haunting
the sewers of Gotham City and became an occasional

419
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:28,177
villain of Batman. Grundy eventually moved to
Opal City, the home of Starman, whom Grundy

420
00:37:28,217 --> 00:37:34,122
met in the sewers there. Grundy, innocent and
childlike in this incarnation, became friends

421
00:37:34,142 --> 00:37:40,428
with Jack Knight, aka Starman, who named him
Solly. Grundy also became friends with Mikhail

422
00:37:40,468 --> 00:37:46,393
Thomas, an alien, also known as Starman, and
Grundy even sacrificed himself to save Mikhail

423
00:37:46,413 --> 00:37:51,338
from being crushed by a collapsing building.
Mortally wounded, Grundy was helped. at the

424
00:37:51,378 --> 00:37:56,362
request of Jack Knight, his father Ted Knight,
and Alan Scott, by Batman and the Floronic

425
00:37:56,382 --> 00:38:02,528
Man, the latter of whom was also a plant-based
creature. Together, all five men consumed mystic

426
00:38:02,568 --> 00:38:08,113
seeds that allowed them to enter the consciousness
of Grundy, and though they attempted to rescue

427
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:14,738
the Solly personality, the other malicious and
evil personalities with Grundy proved too strong,

428
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:20,079
and when the men awoke from their journey, Grundy
had died. Grundy joined the Injustice Society

429
00:38:20,119 --> 00:38:25,162
for a time and was later jokerized by Joker
Venom, after which Grundy hid from the world

430
00:38:25,382 --> 00:38:30,046
within Green Arrow's abandoned Arrow Cave. You
can learn more about Green Arrow in our Green

431
00:38:30,106 --> 00:38:36,070
Arrow vs Hawkeye episode. After stumbling across
Grundy and his old cave, Green Arrow was violently

432
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:41,754
attacked by Grundy, forcing Green Arrow to strangle
him with a bowstring. Green Arrow later helped

433
00:38:41,834 --> 00:38:48,143
Dr. Chrissy Cavendish of Star Labs capture the
resurrected Grundy, after Dr. Cavendish claimed

434
00:38:48,263 --> 00:38:54,067
to be a descendant of Cyrus Gold. When the cure
intended for Grundy instead transformed Dr.

435
00:38:54,107 --> 00:39:00,391
Cavendish into a monster, Green Arrow managed
to defeat her and then set Grundy free. After

436
00:39:00,431 --> 00:39:05,375
joining the Secret Society of Super-Villains
at the Secret Six, Grundy was killed by Superboy

437
00:39:05,435 --> 00:39:12,780
Prime and was reborn with an advanced intellect,
with which he orchestrated a complex plot to

438
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:18,068
manipulate the Justice League of America to
helping him transfer his new mind into the

439
00:39:18,128 --> 00:39:24,434
body of an indestructible amazo android. Before
his plan could come to fruition, however, he

440
00:39:24,474 --> 00:39:29,598
was torn apart by the wind power of Red Tornado,
who you can learn more about in our Red Tornado

441
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:35,423
vs. Sandman episode. After dying on the planet
known as Salvation, where he and countless

442
00:39:35,503 --> 00:39:40,948
other villains were imprisoned by Amanda Waller,
Grundy was reborn in Slaughter Swamp, this

443
00:39:40,988 --> 00:39:47,221
time as Cyrus Gold. Possessing fragmented memories
of his violent life as Cyrus and becoming self-aware

444
00:39:47,261 --> 00:39:53,306
of his past lives as Solomon Grundy, he became
terrified of dying again and being reborn as

445
00:39:53,326 --> 00:39:59,131
a mindless zombie, Solomon Grundy. Frustrated
and afraid, Cyrus ended up in a scuffle with

446
00:39:59,211 --> 00:40:04,595
police, and while on the run, he jumped onto
a highway and was killed. Returning to life

447
00:40:04,695 --> 00:40:09,179
once again as a mindless zombie and fleeing
to the Gotham sewers where he battled Killer

448
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:18,206
Croc, and grave of Cyrus Gold, self-aware once
more. It was there that he encountered the

449
00:40:18,246 --> 00:40:23,590
Phantom Stranger, who enlisted Ellen Scott,
Green Lantern, to help Grundy discover who

450
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:29,294
killed Cyrus Gold so that Grundy could forgive
them and his soul could move on into the afterlife.

451
00:40:29,674 --> 00:40:35,318
Not long after, Grundy and Green Lantern shockingly
learned that the one responsible for killing

452
00:40:35,378 --> 00:40:42,143
Cyrus Gold was Cyrus Gold himself. In a fit
of madness, Cyrus Gold had committed suicide

453
00:40:42,263 --> 00:40:47,947
in Slaughter Swamp in the mid 1890s. Unable
to forgive himself, in that moment, Grundy

454
00:40:48,007 --> 00:40:53,511
received a Black Lantern Ring, becoming a Black
Lantern during the Blackest Night events. With

455
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:59,315
the truth revealed, and because the Black Lanterns
were dead and without souls, Cyrus Gold's soul

456
00:40:59,435 --> 00:41:04,979
was pulled into Hell, and Grundy was killed
for the final time when Bizarro flew him into

457
00:41:05,019 --> 00:41:11,310
the sun, destroying Grundy's body and the Black
Lantern Ring. In post-Flashpoint continuity,

458
00:41:11,651 --> 00:41:17,114
the Earth-2 version of Solomon Grundy was a
simple laborer whose wife committed suicide

459
00:41:17,494 --> 00:41:23,177
after Grundy's boss molested her, resulting
in Grundy killing his boss before he, too,

460
00:41:23,477 --> 00:41:30,121
committed suicide. Grundy was later reborn as
a swamp-thing-like Avatar of Decay and Champion

461
00:41:30,201 --> 00:41:35,784
of the Gray. Alan Scott, newly made the Avatar
of Life and Champion of the Green on Earth-2,

462
00:41:36,385 --> 00:41:43,508
imprisoned where there would be no life for
him to drain. On Earth 1, Solomon Grundy continued

463
00:41:43,548 --> 00:41:50,231
his cycle of death and zombie resurrection.
Powers-wise, Solomon Grundy possesses incredible

464
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:56,473
strength and durability, often capable of lifting
up to 100 tons, though his strength varies

465
00:41:56,513 --> 00:42:02,156
from incarnation to incarnation, along with
his intelligence. In a majority of cases, though,

466
00:42:02,416 --> 00:42:08,343
he's mindless and can only recite the Solomon
Grundy nursery rhyme. Grundy is able to regenerate

467
00:42:08,563 --> 00:42:14,906
rapidly if near swamp matter, and he can reattach
limbs if they are removed. If limbs are detached,

468
00:42:15,186 --> 00:42:20,950
they can move independently of his body. Because
he has no vital organs, he cannot be killed

469
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:26,633
by conventional means, and even if he is destroyed,
he will eventually return to life in the waters

470
00:42:26,733 --> 00:42:30,835
of Slaughter Swamp. And that's Solomon Grundy.
With those powers, how the hell did he get

471
00:42:30,875 --> 00:42:37,931
choked out with a bow string by a green arrow?
Bad writing? That's what I thought. Okay, let's

472
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:42,613
do some bad writing of our own as we get into
this duel episode. Because now that we got

473
00:42:42,633 --> 00:42:46,094
their histories and abilities out of the way,
we're gonna speculate on how one of the 1,000

474
00:42:46,494 --> 00:42:52,217
simulated matches will go. The winner is determined
by simulations, not our speculation, but it's

475
00:42:52,257 --> 00:42:56,419
fun to imagine how this fight could play out.
We don't set any rules for this match other

476
00:42:56,439 --> 00:43:00,300
than the characters don't know anything about
each other going in, except that the other

477
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:05,346
character is a threat that needs to be put down.
And we say that they start off about 50 meters

478
00:43:05,386 --> 00:43:10,408
apart in an environment that has no bearing
on the match itself because we don't take stats

479
00:43:10,468 --> 00:43:14,930
for the environment. Plus certain characters
have advantages in some environments over others

480
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:20,672
and we want them to win on their own merits.
So let's get into it. Solomon Grundy and Werewolf

481
00:43:20,712 --> 00:43:25,875
by Night meet on the battlefield. Who goes first?
Alright, I'm gonna say Werewolf by Night goes

482
00:43:25,915 --> 00:43:32,417
first because Solomon Grundy is just too damn
dumb to go first. So with his blood curdling

483
00:43:32,497 --> 00:43:39,220
howl, werewolf is gonna dash on all fours toward
Grundy and just slash him with supernatural

484
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:44,222
speed and Grundy before the dude even realizes
what the heck's going on he doesn't even know

485
00:43:44,242 --> 00:43:49,124
the match has started he's gonna look down and
find that one of his arms is gone just slashed

486
00:43:49,204 --> 00:43:55,787
clean right off just gone yep okay so you know
Grundy he's gonna look down at his arm on the

487
00:43:55,827 --> 00:44:02,489
ground he's just gonna pick it up and then just
chuck that sucker like real hard right at werewolf

488
00:44:02,846 --> 00:44:08,730
And in mid flight, like this arm, the hand is
going to form a fist. So werewolf gets clocked

489
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:13,673
like from a far distance, right in the snout.
And it just knocks him to the ground. Dude,

490
00:44:13,733 --> 00:44:19,057
you don't think canines know how to play fetch
like this is what they do. So like werewolf

491
00:44:19,077 --> 00:44:24,301
doesn't get knocked to the ground like he leaps
up and he just snatches Grundy's arm out of

492
00:44:24,321 --> 00:44:28,884
the air, like a stick that's being thrown at
him. And then with the arm in his mouth, he's

493
00:44:28,904 --> 00:44:33,794
just going to like shake it really hard, like
a chew toy. ripping it to pieces. Okay, except

494
00:44:33,834 --> 00:44:39,177
that the arm, like while it's in werewolf's
mouth, it's just gonna like bend at the elbow

495
00:44:39,257 --> 00:44:44,239
and its hand is gonna reach werewolf's throat
and just choke him out, all right? And while

496
00:44:44,379 --> 00:44:49,181
werewolf is getting choked out, Grundy, he's
been walking toward him and he's gonna grab

497
00:44:49,221 --> 00:44:53,523
werewolf by the scruff of his neck and then
just slam him into the ground repeatedly like

498
00:44:53,563 --> 00:44:59,425
a rag doll. Dude, that is animal abuse. You
sicko. He's a villain. He's not above it. Wait.

499
00:44:59,934 --> 00:45:05,978
Werewolf's gonna let out a yelp and uh, he's
gonna slash off Grundy's other arm that's slamming

500
00:45:05,998 --> 00:45:10,682
him on the ground and then the hand that's grabbing
Werewolf by the throat, he's gonna slash at

501
00:45:10,722 --> 00:45:17,688
that too and just turn that hand into tiny bits.
So Grundy now has no arms and one of the arms

502
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:22,912
has no hand. Jeez. How about that? Alright,
so Grundy, you know, he's probably pretty angry

503
00:45:22,952 --> 00:45:28,377
by this, he's enraged. So he's gonna kick Werewolf
away. And while he does that, the arm with

504
00:45:28,397 --> 00:45:34,263
the still good hand that's gonna crawl up his
body and reattach itself to his shoulder. Okay?

505
00:45:34,283 --> 00:45:38,445
Oh wow. And then with that hand, he's gonna
reattach the other arm, you know, which he

506
00:45:38,465 --> 00:45:43,647
may not have a stump for a hand, but it'll grow
back and heal over time. While Grundy's like

507
00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:49,330
taking all this time while he's busy reattaching
his limbs, Werewolf like stealthily stalked

508
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:56,573
around the battlefield so that he's behind Grundy,
who's now like his prey. And Werewolf is just

509
00:45:56,593 --> 00:46:01,846
gonna pounce onto Grundy's back. and like slash
across his face just turning his nose and mouth

510
00:46:01,866 --> 00:46:07,228
and eyes to ribbons and turning him completely
blind. Geez! I'm gonna say, the werewolf can't

511
00:46:07,268 --> 00:46:11,449
rip out both eyes, you know, Granny's gonna
grab one of werewolf's hands before that can

512
00:46:11,489 --> 00:46:17,191
happen, and he's just gonna crush the bones
in that hand to gravel, like in his fist. Whoa.

513
00:46:17,211 --> 00:46:21,352
And then he's just gonna slam werewolf to the
ground beneath him and just start stomping

514
00:46:21,412 --> 00:46:26,278
on him with his feet, like, turning him into
wolf jelly. Wolf jelly? Grundy doesn't know

515
00:46:26,298 --> 00:46:30,461
what he's stomping, you know, he can barely
see shit. His face is all fucked up. So he

516
00:46:30,561 --> 00:46:35,484
thinks that he's stomping the wolf into jelly,
but really werewolf, he's going to slip away

517
00:46:35,744 --> 00:46:41,408
before he gets stomped just in time and he's
going to bite at Solomon Grundy's Achilles

518
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:47,212
tendon. Just, he's going to rip that whole back
of his ankle off with his teeth. So Grundy

519
00:46:47,232 --> 00:46:53,456
can't walk now and he just falls to the floor.
He's a zombie. You think Grundy like wouldn't

520
00:46:53,556 --> 00:46:59,049
walk on a stomped foot? He's made of like decayed
swamp matter. So I disagree. I don't think

521
00:46:59,089 --> 00:47:05,034
it makes him fall or really, really even slow
him down. Like he's not about that. So while

522
00:47:05,094 --> 00:47:10,559
standing still with his superior reach, Grundy's
just gonna grab werewolf like an action figure

523
00:47:10,579 --> 00:47:16,183
with his good hand and with his superior strength,
he's just gonna squeeze and snap werewolf's

524
00:47:16,263 --> 00:47:22,689
spine like a toothpick with a loud crack and
now werewolf is paralyzed. Damn! That's, well,

525
00:47:22,709 --> 00:47:27,015
I mean, okay. If the werewolf is paralyzed,
it's only from the waist down, right? Otherwise

526
00:47:27,035 --> 00:47:32,498
he'd be dead. Um, so the werewolf is still in
his grasp, but he's like fucking going into

527
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:37,721
full wolf mode. You know, he's like super furious
and with his good claw, the one that's not

528
00:47:37,761 --> 00:47:42,804
broken, he's going to slash at Grundy's throat,
just slicing the whole head from Grundy's body

529
00:47:42,844 --> 00:47:48,187
clean off, sending it flying through the air
and like landing with a sick thud. And, uh,

530
00:47:48,247 --> 00:47:54,682
it must be Saturday because Solomon Grundy is
dead. Match over. And eventually werewolf was

531
00:47:54,702 --> 00:48:00,165
just going to heal from all his wounds. Except
you didn't suspect this during this whole time.

532
00:48:00,445 --> 00:48:06,749
Grundy's other hand that was torn up has now
grown back and his arm that's holding werewolf

533
00:48:06,849 --> 00:48:11,431
stretched out. So, you know, the werewolves
just slashing get air and can't reach Grundy's

534
00:48:11,491 --> 00:48:16,814
head. You know, with Grundy's newly grown hand,
he's going to reach into his decaying body

535
00:48:17,115 --> 00:48:23,142
and pull out a knife made of silver. What he's
going to plunge into werewolves hearts. killing

536
00:48:23,162 --> 00:48:28,323
him instantly. What the fuck? You can't just
have Grundy literally pull a silver weapon

537
00:48:28,443 --> 00:48:33,445
from his ass and try to win that way. Like what
is that? Dude, you never know what kind of

538
00:48:33,505 --> 00:48:38,986
trash and treasure you're gonna find in the
swamp. You can't claim that. Silver in the

539
00:48:39,026 --> 00:48:43,747
swamp? You think people are just dropping silver
in the swamp? Maybe? I mean, I don't know.

540
00:48:43,767 --> 00:48:50,629
Oh my god. I guess it was kind of a clever way
to try to introduce silver into this match.

541
00:48:51,114 --> 00:48:55,375
I mean in the video game Injustice, like he
has knives and even like a whole tombstone

542
00:48:55,675 --> 00:49:00,137
that he pulls out of his body. It's pretty cool.
Really? Yeah. Oh, I guess I've never played

543
00:49:00,177 --> 00:49:04,339
as Grundy in Injustice. I don't remember that,
but he regularly just has random shit in his

544
00:49:04,379 --> 00:49:10,001
body. I mean, I've never seen it in the comics,
but sure. There's some precedent. I mean, his

545
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:15,824
body is made up of stuff from the swamp. Okay.
Well, we'll go ahead and end the match there.

546
00:49:16,044 --> 00:49:22,555
Either Grundy gets his head chopped off by werewolves
claws. or Grundy pulls a silver knife from

547
00:49:22,595 --> 00:49:26,557
his ass and stabs werewolf. It was from his
torso. He's not pulling anything out of his

548
00:49:26,657 --> 00:49:32,721
ass. We'll go ahead and input the stats on these
characters into our simulation runner and come

549
00:49:32,741 --> 00:49:34,081
out with a winner. We'll be right back.

550
00:49:38,806 --> 00:49:45,168
Okay, so going into this match, I knew that
Grundy was going to be really high in several

551
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:49,490
stat categories. Yeah, I could pretty much concede
right away that I knew Solomon Grundy was going

552
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:54,993
to be really high in durability, strength, and
damage. And he was much higher than Werewolf

553
00:49:55,033 --> 00:50:00,875
by night, but also maybe not quite as much as
people would think because his powers are variable.

554
00:50:01,155 --> 00:50:06,017
Yeah, pretty much everywhere I looked across
the internet, they did bring up the fact that...

555
00:50:06,474 --> 00:50:12,277
His strength levels varied from incarnation
to incarnation whenever he was reborn. Sometimes

556
00:50:12,357 --> 00:50:18,420
Batman can hurt him. Sometimes Superman couldn't.
So I had a really hard time giving him max

557
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:25,044
stats in certain categories like strength, knowing
that there are points in time when he was weaker

558
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:30,587
than that. So I had to sort of average it. He's
still on the higher end, just not at max second

559
00:50:30,607 --> 00:50:35,889
to max, basically. Yeah. But where Solomon Grundy
was higher in durability, strength and damage,

560
00:50:36,246 --> 00:50:42,551
Werewolf by Night had him beat in speed, intellect,
and perception due to his enhanced senses.

561
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:48,436
Yeah, intellect was a big one. Solomon Grundy
is known for not being bright. He is a mindless

562
00:50:48,456 --> 00:50:53,280
zombie a majority of the time. There's been
a number of instances where he's been highly

563
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:59,665
intelligent, but it's extremely rare. Surprisingly,
we gave Solomon Grundy the higher range stat,

564
00:50:59,966 --> 00:51:05,878
if only because his limbs are still operable
from a distance. Whereas werewolf by night

565
00:51:05,918 --> 00:51:10,519
has basically no range. He doesn't like shoot
anything out or throw anything. I think what

566
00:51:10,539 --> 00:51:15,761
surprised me the most was how durable werewolf
by night was. I thought Grundy was going to

567
00:51:15,801 --> 00:51:21,062
totally stomp werewolf by night in terms of
durability, but I didn't know werewolf by night

568
00:51:21,082 --> 00:51:26,904
was fully regenerative. Yeah, one time Deadpool
cut off his head and it grew back because Deadpool

569
00:51:26,924 --> 00:51:31,365
didn't use silver weapons. But with the stats
put in and the simulations run, Jonathan, who

570
00:51:31,385 --> 00:51:34,783
do you think is going to come out on top? I
think Grundy is going to come out on top. I

571
00:51:34,823 --> 00:51:39,405
just think he's so much stronger. He could do
much more damage. And, you know, a lot of people

572
00:51:39,525 --> 00:51:44,328
agree with me, according to our Instagram poll,
74% of you think that Solomon Grundy is going

573
00:51:44,348 --> 00:51:49,471
to take this match. Well, are they right? Or
I'm pretty sure they're right. Let's find out.

574
00:51:49,771 --> 00:51:59,056
The winner between Solomon Grundy and Werewolf
by Night is. Werewolf by Night. What? This

575
00:51:59,557 --> 00:52:05,252
may be an upset. but we have the data to prove
it. By how much? Werewolf by Night actually

576
00:52:05,312 --> 00:52:11,857
won 562 of the matches over Solomon Grundy.
Now Grundy had the advantage in durability,

577
00:52:11,897 --> 00:52:18,522
strength, damage, and range, but Werewolf by
Night was more evasive and agile. He had greater

578
00:52:18,622 --> 00:52:24,205
speed, had greater perception and intelligence.
The match came really close, but in the end

579
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:29,189
it was Werewolf by Night that scored higher
in the simulations. I'm never quite sure how

580
00:52:29,409 --> 00:52:35,333
to... deduce who's going to win when one character
is very well balanced and another character

581
00:52:35,533 --> 00:52:41,057
is not. It goes both ways and I guess this time
it went towards werewolf by knight. I thought

582
00:52:41,097 --> 00:52:45,700
it was going to be a closer match than this
if werewolf by knight did win. I'm actually

583
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:51,204
surprised by these results because I mean, Solomon
Gerdie, he's like the Hulk almost. Yeah, but

584
00:52:51,244 --> 00:52:55,847
not a smart Hulk. I mean, no one likes smart
Hulk. He also didn't get high marks in fighting

585
00:52:56,007 --> 00:53:00,506
either, whereas werewolf by knight, you know,
is like a seasoned experienced Solomon Grundy

586
00:53:00,546 --> 00:53:04,868
kind of has to start over from the beginning
every time he's reborn. That's fair. Damn it.

587
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:10,530
I guess it is a Saturday. On a Tuesday. Sorry
to all the Solomon Grundy fans out there, but

588
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:15,552
also not really. That does it for this duel.

00:54:05,981 --> 00:54:10,283
it and review it for you guys. Yeah, I kind
of wish that Marvel and DC didn't dump all

599
00:54:10,323 --> 00:54:15,245
of their content at the end of the year. I feel
like they did this last year as well. But I'm

600
00:54:15,265 --> 00:54:18,886
looking forward to the movie. So I'll let you
