00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a Dynamike Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,718 --> 00:00:28,939
Hi and welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast,
a weekly show where we review superhero films

3
00:00:29,299 --> 00:00:34,020
and debate the superiority between Marvel and
DC by comparing their characters in stat-based

4
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:40,242
battle simulations. I'm Marvelous Joe. And I'm
his twin brother Johnny DC. And in this episode

5
00:00:40,282 --> 00:00:45,804
we are going to review the latest DC animated
release, Justice League War World. It's the

6
00:00:45,844 --> 00:00:50,805
latest movie in the Tomorrowverse series of
animated films. And you know what? I did not

7
00:00:50,825 --> 00:00:55,679
like it. but Jonathan says that if you watch
it three times, it becomes good. So we're gonna

8
00:00:55,699 --> 00:01:02,402
learn all about his thoughts on the movie later
on this episode. I mean, not great, but not

9
00:01:02,442 --> 00:01:07,084
the worst either. Yeah, I mean, it's interesting
at the very least. Before we talk about the

10
00:01:07,104 --> 00:01:10,546
film, we're gonna go into the latest comic book
movie news that came out from the past week,

11
00:01:10,966 --> 00:01:16,448
of which there's only one news item, and that
is the Loki season two official trailer. As

12
00:01:16,528 --> 00:01:20,187
always, we list our segment times in our episode
description. so feel free to check out the

13
00:01:20,207 --> 00:01:25,373

topic. And as our listeners may know, our Dual

14
00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:30,699
Simulator is so advanced that it's gained sentience

I'm really excited about it. I'm really pulling

29
00:03:04,445 --> 00:03:08,367
for Jack Sparrow on this one. You know what
would have been a good matchup? Jack Sparrow

30
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:15,170
versus Mera from Aquaman. No, I feel like that
match would have shit the bed. Ha ha ha. Also,

31
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:21,253

quick to the no prize! The no prize is an award

39
00:04:02,752 --> 00:04:07,814
Marvel used to give out to fans. Our version,
the Dynamic Duel No Prize, is a digital award

40
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:12,975
that we post on Instagram and in our email newsletter
for the person that we feel gave the best answer

41
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:18,337
to our question of the week. Last week's question
was, who is your favorite Spider-Man or woman

42
00:04:18,637 --> 00:04:24,455
across the comics multiverse and why? And that
was coming off the news regarding Sony's indefinite

43
00:04:24,495 --> 00:04:29,358
delay of the Across the Spider-Verse sequel,
Beyond the Spider-Verse. We got a lot of great

44
00:04:29,418 --> 00:04:32,840
answers here, so let's go ahead and break down
our three honorable mentions as well as the

45
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:39,104
no-prize winner. Our first honorable mention
goes to Colby Hentges, who said, Hey boys,

46
00:04:39,144 --> 00:04:45,747
Colby Hentges. My favorite Spider-Man Across
the entire multiverse is in the 616, the original

47
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:51,330
recipe Peter Parker body but brain controlled
by Otto Octavius. The Superior Spider-Man was

48
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:56,693
such a good run. The Goblin Army versus Spider
Army, just the way he pissed off the rest of

49
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:02,417
the Avengers, it was great. Yeah, the Superior
Spider-Man was a great arc in the Spider-Man

50
00:05:02,437 --> 00:05:07,840
comic books, largely because I think in some
ways, Otto Octavius was a better Spider-Man,

51
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,562
not like morally or anything, or as a hero,
but the ideas that he brought to the character

52
00:05:12,602 --> 00:05:16,925
of the Spider-Man mythos, all the technology
and upgrading Peter Parker to the head of his

53
00:05:16,965 --> 00:05:21,920
own corporation and everything. All that stuff
I thought was really cool. Yeah, it's Spider-Man

54
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,665
as I've always wanted Spider-Man to be. He just
looked super cool. I've always had problems

55
00:05:27,705 --> 00:05:33,149
with Spider-Man's costume, and I thought the
superior Spider-Man costume is the most superior

56
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:38,594
Spider-Man costume probably ever. It did a good
job of kind of showing Peter Parker's weakness

57
00:05:38,794 --> 00:05:43,277
as like a science guy, you know, because after
he invented the web shooters, for as smart

58
00:05:43,318 --> 00:05:47,201
as he is, he should have gone on to invent a
lot of other cool shit for himself that he

59
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:52,285
just never did that. Otto really introduced
to the character. So great answer Colby, our

60
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:58,209
next honorable mention goes to Christopher Minotti
who said, Hi guys Christopher Minotti. My favorite

61
00:05:58,249 --> 00:06:04,014
Spider-Man is probably Spider-Man Noir. I love
this character, I think he's great. His whole

62
00:06:04,034 --> 00:06:10,519
demeanor is really cool and his, I think his
world is really interesting. I know this isn't

63
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,265
comics but I really liked him in the first Spider-Verse
movie as well. He was very funny and an interesting

64
00:06:17,305 --> 00:06:23,029
character. Not to mention he does remind me
of Batman and Rorschach. And I love those characters,

65
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:29,174
too. Yeah, Abner O'Terry gave the same answer.
And I have to agree, if you want to make Spider-Man

66
00:06:29,194 --> 00:06:36,580
cooler, make him more like DC characters. You
can't deny it. Better, but I would say, you

67
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:41,104
know, unique and different and interesting.
Spider-Man Noir is cool. The comics version

68
00:06:41,144 --> 00:06:46,409
of the character is not like the into the Spiderverse
version voiced by Nicolas Cage, but the character

69
00:06:46,449 --> 00:06:51,110
itself is a lot of fun. making Spider-Man more
of a pulpy hero and setting it during the early

70
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:55,232
20th century, I think is a really cool sandbox
that they've come up with a lot of awesome

71
00:06:55,272 --> 00:07:01,513
stories for. Great answer! Our final honorable
mention goes to Travis Herndon, who said, Hey

72
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:09,095
guys, it's Travis. My favorite Spider-Man related
character would definitely have to be Silk.

73
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:14,317
I think she's a very underrated character, especially
nowadays, since everybody kind of

74
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:23,435
that she kind of gets the short end of the stick
for fans. So for me, I definitely say Silk.

75
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:28,059
Silk is my favorite and hope they do more with
her in the later future, either in Sony or

76
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:34,264
in the MCU. Yes, Silk is Cindy Moon. She's the
Korean American Spider Woman who was bit by

77
00:07:34,304 --> 00:07:39,368
the same radioactive spider that bit Peter Parker
after it had bit him. It fell to the ground

78
00:07:39,388 --> 00:07:44,873
to put her on the ankle. And then she was kind
of locked away for a decade by Ezekiel, it's

79
00:07:44,913 --> 00:07:49,219
a whole story there. but she is a fantastic
character, Silk. And yeah, it would be really

80
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:53,882
cool to see her get her due in the same way
that Miles and Spider-Gwen have. Yeah, I don't

81
00:07:53,902 --> 00:07:57,524
know much about the character, but she does
have a cool look from what I've seen. She has

82
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:02,066
a great costume, yeah. One of these days we'll
do a duel with her, although it took us a long

83
00:08:02,086 --> 00:08:05,969
time to get to Spider-Woman eventually, which
we did within the past couple months, but we'll

84
00:08:05,989 --> 00:08:10,451
get to Silk eventually. We wanna give a quick
shout out to everyone who took the time to

85
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:16,742
visit our website and record an answer, including
Matt Estes, Connor Pierce, and Alex Wong. But

86
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:22,806
the winner of this week's no prize is Anson
Millard who said, Hey, what's up? This is Anson

87
00:08:22,826 --> 00:08:30,310
Millard. My favorite Spider-Man from the Spider-verse
is the Spider-Man that appears in the 90s animated

88
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:38,314
cartoon. The voice actor in my mind is the voice
of Spider-Man. That cartoon was really awesome

89
00:08:38,494 --> 00:08:44,437
and it was in large part because of the character.
He was a Spider-Man that could balance the

90
00:08:44,497 --> 00:08:49,060
humor. but then also the more serious moments
you need to have as Spider-Man, so I think

91
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,283
he's the best. And purely for nostalgic reasons,
I'm giving this answer the no prize win because

92
00:08:54,303 --> 00:08:58,245
like Anson said, it was a great version of the
character. To this day, when I read Spider-Man

93
00:08:58,285 --> 00:09:02,727
comic books and I read that dialogue, I still
hear it in the 90s animated Spider-Man's voice.

94
00:09:03,228 --> 00:09:07,490
It was iconic for me in the same way that like
Kevin Conroy's voice will always and forever

95
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:13,173
be Batman. Yeah, absolutely. I don't know the
actor's name for the 90s cartoon, but he absolutely

96
00:09:13,193 --> 00:09:17,888
pulled off. the humor and fun of the character.
Yeah, nailing the emotional beats as well,

97
00:09:18,288 --> 00:09:22,991
and like the hopefulness, I think, that should
be behind Peter Parker's voice. I really hope

98
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:27,453
they bring him back for like Beyond the Spider-Verse,
just as like a cameo, that'd be really cool.

99
00:09:27,914 --> 00:09:32,936
That would be everything, that would be incredible.
That needs to happen. But great answer, Anson,

100
00:09:32,976 --> 00:09:36,859
you win this week's No Prize. If you, the listener,
want a shot at winning your own No Prize, stay

101
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,341
tuned to later on this episode when we'll be
asking another Question of the Week. And now

102
00:09:41,381 --> 00:09:43,377
that that's done. Lots of the news!

103
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:53,357
Alright, this past week we got the official
trailer for Marvel Studios' Loki Season 2,

104
00:09:53,397 --> 00:09:58,282
which will be debuting on Disney Plus in a few
months. Loki is definitely one of the better

105
00:09:58,742 --> 00:10:02,625
Marvel Disney Plus television shows. Season
1 was really good, so I'm really glad that

106
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:08,130
we're getting a Season 2. And the production
quality that was all over Season 1 seems to

107
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:14,475
be even more incredible here. The look and feel
of the Loki television series is just incredible,

108
00:10:14,535 --> 00:10:19,695
and I'm so glad that that's staying consistent.
Oh, yeah, just the color palette of the show,

109
00:10:19,735 --> 00:10:24,098
like the orange and green with a little bit
of splash and purple whenever Kang is involved.

110
00:10:24,378 --> 00:10:30,842
It's just really well done. The color palette,
the sets, the cinematography, the special effects.

111
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:35,104
It all just looks so incredible, better than
a lot of movies, honestly. I think we've said

112
00:10:35,124 --> 00:10:40,467
that on the show before. That was my first impression
watching this trailer was, damn, everything

113
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:45,995
still looks good. I would say this is probably
Marvel's best. television series not only because

114
00:10:46,015 --> 00:10:50,098
you know Tom Hiddleston is great and the show
is just really well written But I also really

115
00:10:50,138 --> 00:10:56,564
felt like it moved the narrative of the MCU
forward in a way that a lot of MCU Movies and

116
00:10:56,584 --> 00:11:00,747
shows don't really feel like they're doing great
now Yeah because Loki season one kicked off

117
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:05,431
the whole multiverse thing that wasn't really
revisited again until The recent Ant-Man and

118
00:11:05,451 --> 00:11:10,615
the Wasp quantumania movie where we got to get
our introduction to King the Conqueror And

119
00:11:10,655 --> 00:11:15,999
we're gonna see him again in Loki season 2 It
should definitely shepherd along the whole

120
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:22,063
multiversal saga and bring us closer to the
next Avengers movie, which is going to be The

121
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:27,867
Kang Dynasty. But the trailer starts off with
Mobius, played by Owen Wilson, and Loki, played

122
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:33,871
by Tom Hiddleston, going to visit, and I'm going
to butcher his name, Kehui Kuan, the recent

123
00:11:33,911 --> 00:11:39,035
actor who won Best Supporting Actor for Everything
Everywhere All at Once. It's so cool to see

124
00:11:39,075 --> 00:11:45,214
him here playing a member of the TVA who witnesses
Loki. time-slipping which is supposed to be

125
00:11:45,274 --> 00:11:49,855
impossible in the TVA. The chemistry between
these three characters, you can already tell,

126
00:11:49,935 --> 00:11:55,497
it's just, it's gonna be fascinating. I think
Owen Wilson is probably underrated in terms

127
00:11:55,537 --> 00:12:00,318
of the balance and laid-back feel that he brings
to the proceedings. I'm really excited to see

128
00:12:00,358 --> 00:12:04,599
him show up in the Deadpool movie, which is
rumored to happen. I think confirmed to happen,

129
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:09,981
but either way, that'll be really cool. Loki
explains how he's getting pulled through time,

130
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:16,116
through the present and the past. We see come
back in this season. She has a really dumb

131
00:12:16,156 --> 00:12:20,480
haircut. I wonder what's going on with her character
because we see her like all over the place

132
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,605
too. Like in one universe she's like in a record
store and the other one she's like behind the

133
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:31,491
register at a fast food place. Eventually we
do see her kick ass in a few shots so we know

134
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:36,796
that whatever happens she returns to form from
season one but she gives a pretty good line

135
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:41,462
exchange with Loki. in the trailer where she
says we can't play God and he's like we are

136
00:12:41,482 --> 00:12:45,903
gods. You know, the problem is choosing who
lives and dies, you know. I think it's a great

137
00:12:45,943 --> 00:12:50,745
concept for this upcoming season. Yeah, Sylvie
was one of my favorite characters in season

138
00:12:50,905 --> 00:12:55,466
one. So, it's great that they found a way to
have the actress return, if not that specific

139
00:12:55,526 --> 00:13:00,547
version of the character. I think one of the
other main things I took away from this trailer

140
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:05,369
was that the action looks pretty good. Tom Hiddleston
kind of seems like a badass, you know, between

141
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:09,658
like the cool suits that he wears. His wardrobe
is fantastic. but he also just carries himself

142
00:13:09,698 --> 00:13:14,799
really well as Loki. He has this greater confidence,
it seems, about him within this season, now

143
00:13:14,819 --> 00:13:21,881
that he's kind of become more accustomed to
this TVA time spy role. The season looks incredible.

144
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:26,642
It looks amazing. I hope it lives up to the
hype that I feel from watching this trailer,

145
00:13:27,143 --> 00:13:32,664
but I guess we'll know starting October 6th
on Disney+. We'll probably get another trailer

146
00:13:32,704 --> 00:13:37,625
before then, but speaking of season two of Loki,
that brings us to our question of the week.

147
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:48,414
Besides Loki, what other Disney Plus Marvel
television series that has come out do you

148
00:13:48,534 --> 00:13:54,058
most hope gets a season 2? Yeah, Disney Plus
has had quite a few other Marvel television

149
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:58,101
series come out. Loki is the only one that's
gotten a season 2. There's not really been

150
00:13:58,141 --> 00:14:03,244
any word on any other series getting a season
2, but if you could pick one to get another

season, which one would it be? Record your answer

157
00:14:35,022 --> 00:14:38,148
But I think that does it for all the news for
this episode, so let's go ahead and get into

158
00:14:38,308 --> 00:14:45,101
our main event, where we review the latest DC
animated film to come out, Justice League War

159
00:14:45,141 --> 00:14:45,341
World.

160
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:06,271
Alright, Justice League Warworld is DC's latest
direct-to-video animated film set in the same

161
00:15:06,371 --> 00:15:12,493
animated universe established by the film Superman
Man of Tomorrow, known as the Tomorrowverse.

162
00:15:12,973 --> 00:15:19,515
Warworld is the seventh film set in the Tomorrowverse
after prior films set up Superman, Batman,

163
00:15:19,555 --> 00:15:24,956
the Justice League, the Legion of Superheroes
and the Future, and an alternate history slash

164
00:15:24,976 --> 00:15:31,483
dimension with a version of Wonder Woman in
the Justice Society, during World War II. Justice

165
00:15:31,523 --> 00:15:36,748
League Warworld, like every single other film
in the Tomorrowverse, has an incredible premise,

166
00:15:37,168 --> 00:15:42,052
though only half of those films, in my opinion,
have been able to stick the landing well enough

167
00:15:42,112 --> 00:15:47,697
that I would recommend them to others. The Tomorrowverse
is pretty hit or miss in terms of storytelling.

168
00:15:48,137 --> 00:15:54,602
So how did Justice League Warworld fare? Regrettably,
I'd call it a miss, because while the idea

169
00:15:54,642 --> 00:16:01,338
of the film is fantastic, the execution, not
so much. If you, the listener, do plan on checking

170
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:07,400
the film out, maybe when it's on Max or something,
stop listening now because there is an overarching

171
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:12,101
mystery across the film and we will be getting
into spoilers. Yeah, if you're not going to

172
00:16:12,121 --> 00:16:17,122
watch this film, why are you even listening
to this review? You know, I guess if you want

173
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:21,624
to know like what the movie is about, listening
to this review is probably a more understandable,

174
00:16:21,844 --> 00:16:27,865
coherent experience in watching the film itself.
So if you want to stick around for that, yeah,

175
00:16:27,925 --> 00:16:33,108
keep listening. I imagine a majority of the
people who watch the movie are going to be

176
00:16:33,188 --> 00:16:38,831
amongst the most diehard DC fans, which is good,
because anyone else I think is going to be

177
00:16:38,871 --> 00:16:45,755
considerably lost due to the film's fairly experimental
nature. You know, it doesn't have your standard

178
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:51,838
three act structure, and it plays out initially
more like a series of anthological Elseworld

179
00:16:51,918 --> 00:17:00,050
shorts, which is what I wish this actually ended
up being in the end. are essentially DC's version

180
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:05,493
of what if, though like Elseworlds are a lot
better. Like I'm almost embarrassed for Marvel.

181
00:17:06,194 --> 00:17:11,076
I'm not, and that's surprising that you're saying
that, considering the quality of this DC film.

182
00:17:11,557 --> 00:17:15,559
I'm embarrassed for DC. No, I'm saying that
the- Why are you trying to talk shit about

183
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:21,182
Marvel when this movie sucked? Is what I wanna
know. It didn't suck that hard, I mean, come

184
00:17:21,282 --> 00:17:28,394
on. Elseworlds are a way for DC to tell stories
within new genres and time periods. and it's

185
00:17:28,434 --> 00:17:34,717
a chance to re-explore and re-examine characters
that are familiar to us, such as Superman being

186
00:17:34,797 --> 00:17:41,041
raised in the Soviet Union, or Batman in a Tale
of Lovecraftian Horror. Elseworlds are some

187
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:45,983
of my favorite DC stories, so I was pretty excited
when the trailers for Justice League Warworld

188
00:17:46,043 --> 00:17:52,787
showed us that DC's trinity of Superman, Batman,
and Wonder Woman would inhabit these alternative

189
00:17:52,867 --> 00:17:58,794
worlds. And exploring those worlds were the
best parts of the movie. Wonder Woman as this

190
00:17:58,934 --> 00:18:06,118
nameless, gun-toting badass cowgirl in a western
worked surprisingly well, Batman as a Conan

191
00:18:06,158 --> 00:18:12,462
the Barbarian analog in a swords and sorcery
fantasy adventure was cool as hell, and Superman

192
00:18:12,662 --> 00:18:18,465
as a government agent dealing with a potential
alien threat in a Twilight Zone-esque sci-fi

193
00:18:18,505 --> 00:18:24,308
horror was pretty crazy. Each of the different
genres we encountered contained an interesting

194
00:18:24,368 --> 00:18:29,847
premise and a fair bit of action. Though if
audiences weren't expecting something of an

195
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:35,270
anthology in this film, they were probably really
confused. Yeah, also because there were no

196
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:40,933
real transitions between each act as well. Yeah,
you're right, no transition whatsoever. Now,

197
00:18:40,973 --> 00:18:46,296
you and I are no stranger to DC's animated anthological
shorts. We've reviewed several collections

198
00:18:46,316 --> 00:18:51,699
of them on this podcast, including Superman
Shazam, The Return of Black Adam, Batman Death

199
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:56,782
in the Family, and Constantine the House of
Mystery. They're interesting. I enjoy most

200
00:18:56,822 --> 00:19:02,328
of DC shorts, as I did here in Justice League
Warworld, even though they weren't technically

201
00:19:02,388 --> 00:19:07,272
shorts. It was the connective tissue between
the individual tales that made things a little

202
00:19:07,292 --> 00:19:12,717
confusing for me in this film, and by the time
we learned that, oh, it was all a dream, it

203
00:19:12,757 --> 00:19:18,343
was all an illusion, it wasn't quite the satisfying
or clever reveal that I think the filmmakers

204
00:19:18,403 --> 00:19:24,204
intended. Yeah, the answer is that we did. ultimately
end up getting weren't quite satisfying given

205
00:19:24,404 --> 00:19:28,827
that for a vast majority of this film, like
two thirds of this film, we're stuck in this

206
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:34,431
mystery that employs a lot of dream logic as
it were. There's a lot of things that happen

207
00:19:34,471 --> 00:19:39,876
here that don't actually matter, that are confusing.
And then once you realize what's actually going

208
00:19:39,996 --> 00:19:46,180
on, it's like, well, that was like a waste of
time. It kind of felt like, you know? Yeah.

209
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,868
100% I agree with you. I think the most confusing
and frustrating aspect of the conclusion to

210
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:59,193
me was just how rushed and vague it was. Like,
so much of the Tomorrowverse happens off-screen,

211
00:19:59,393 --> 00:20:04,197
like the formation of the Justice League or
how Mongol captured Superman, Batman, and Wonder

212
00:20:04,217 --> 00:20:10,001
Woman to begin with. We don't know how or why
Warworld established a telepathic link with

213
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:16,305
Mongol, and it's super unclear to me as to whether
or not the Lobo and Martian Manhunter in this

214
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:21,624
film are the same ones from Superman Man of
Tomorrow or if they're from another universe

215
00:20:21,644 --> 00:20:27,066
within the multiverse. Now, I kind of got the
impression that Warworld was able to traverse

216
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:32,088
multiple dimensions. Right, exactly. Now, we
know Superman and Batman have met each other

217
00:20:32,268 --> 00:20:37,291
in the Tomorrowverse, but again, we're not entirely
clear as to whether this version of Superman

218
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:43,073
and Batman have met before. And Wonder Woman
was really confusing because in the Tomorrowverse,

219
00:20:43,093 --> 00:20:47,355
Wonder Woman... was part of the Justice Society.
We hadn't even seen her in the modern times

220
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:52,897
yet, but she was talking to Clark like she knew
him. Well, Superman was in the final battle

221
00:20:53,077 --> 00:20:59,220
of Justice Society. That's right. It was a different
version of Superman though. Yeah, one that

222
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,622
manifested during World War II, as opposed to
the Superman that was in Man of Tomorrow who

223
00:21:04,662 --> 00:21:08,884
debuted in modern times. Yeah, that's why Wonder
Woman in this movie said that he looked so

224
00:21:08,924 --> 00:21:14,630
much younger. I see, yeah. I felt like the whole
film was really not only a setup for Crisis

225
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:20,353
on Infinite Earths, but a way to get Wonder
Woman into the same universe as Superman and

226
00:21:20,373 --> 00:21:26,375
Batman. But it just was a really stupid way
to do that. I'm like, couldn't you just use

227
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:31,057
DC's animated film for next year, Crisis on
Infinite Earths, to introduce the World War

228
00:21:31,097 --> 00:21:36,779
II Wonder Woman to the main timeline? Like,
was Justice League War World even necessary?

229
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:44,034
Or was it just an idea that no one said no to?
Because that's what it feels like. Absolutely.

230
00:21:44,374 --> 00:21:49,996
I think you're spot on right there. They're
like, dudes, what if like Wonder Woman used

231
00:21:50,036 --> 00:21:56,199
her lasso like a cowboy? And the other person
was like, yeah, man, I'm so fucking high right

232
00:21:56,219 --> 00:22:03,743
now. And what if like Batman was like Conan?
Whoa. And what if like we're all aliens? Oh,

233
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:09,805
that's an idea for a Superman story. There you
go. Yeah. It's not a great way to develop a

234
00:22:09,845 --> 00:22:14,588
story for sure. And I'm absolutely convinced
that's how this movie happened. It was cool

235
00:22:14,608 --> 00:22:19,952
that we got to see these obscure characters,
but almost all of them, except for Warlord,

236
00:22:20,152 --> 00:22:27,578
were arguably handled somewhat disrespectfully.
Jonah Hex was made a villain, Batlash was killed,

237
00:22:27,858 --> 00:22:34,523
Mashiest was killed, Snapper Car and the Langs
were aliens, King Faraday was a hostile maniac,

238
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:40,399
and even the White Martians were essentially
laser d***. gun-toting fodder for the heroes

239
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:45,082
to punch, which should have been a huge red
flag for the filmmakers. Like, why do white

240
00:22:45,122 --> 00:22:50,646
Martians need to carry laser guns? They're fucking
white Martians. Right? They have Martian vision.

241
00:22:50,906 --> 00:22:56,710
I mean, would any fans of these characters appreciate
the way any of them were handled in this movie?

242
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:02,754
I would argue probably not. The one good thing
I could say about this film and all Tomorrowverse

243
00:23:02,774 --> 00:23:09,058
films is that the animation and character designs
are a sight to behold. I think Diana definitely

244
00:23:09,098 --> 00:23:14,621
wins the award for best dressed in this film.
Whether it's as a star-spangled cowgirl, a

245
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:20,825
fierce damsel in a fierce bikini, or a spectacled
and modest secretary, she looked great. It

246
00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:25,387
was cool seeing the three characters and how
they exist within these three separate worlds.

247
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:30,690
Visually, the film does have a lot going for
it. Yeah, yeah. With Bruce in his story, I

248
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:36,313
thought the Conan look was a little on the nose,
but the bat helmet was cool. If not short-lived.

249
00:23:36,786 --> 00:23:40,887
I do wish he got to keep that bat cape a little
bit longer. That would have been awesome. Yeah,

250
00:23:41,007 --> 00:23:46,948
yeah. Mongul's design was the only one I was
iffy on. Like, it wasn't terrible. I think

251
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:52,350
they may have been trying to differentiate him
a bit from like a yellow dark side, but I wish

252
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:57,431
he looked a little less shriveled. Yeah, he
looks kind of scrawny here. I think he's usually

253
00:23:57,471 --> 00:24:02,493
more bulked up than that. But I might just be
used to like Ed McGinnis's style of drawing

254
00:24:02,533 --> 00:24:07,002
the character and Ed McGinnis draws everybody
really poofy. Yeah, no, that's how the character

255
00:24:07,202 --> 00:24:11,543
normally is depicted. Okay, okay. Now we've
talked a little bit about some characters'

256
00:24:11,563 --> 00:24:16,545
appearances, but let's dive a little bit more
into them in our character breakdown. Now Diana

257
00:24:16,565 --> 00:24:22,946
Prince, AKA Wonder Woman, was voiced by Stana
Kanick, who lends a strong and exotic presence

258
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:27,848
to Diana's character. And she did back in the
first film she appeared in, Justice Society

259
00:24:27,888 --> 00:24:33,149
World War II. For sure, she's incredible. I
thought she did an even better job in this

260
00:24:33,189 --> 00:24:38,910
movie. than she did in her debut voice appearance,
and that was amazing too. Martian Manhunter

261
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:44,314
at the end of the film revealed what he learned
from each of the protagonists. From Diana he

262
00:24:44,354 --> 00:24:50,239
said he learned not to give up. Dedication,
as it were, as we see Diana dedicated to the

263
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:55,744
townsfolk despite the fact that they had broken
the law because they were the ones in need

264
00:24:55,784 --> 00:25:00,788
of physical protection. It's often said that
Wonder Woman is a tough character to tackle

265
00:25:01,129 --> 00:25:07,296
because she's a Warrior of Peace, which is contradictory,
but I thought this was a great showcase of

266
00:25:07,336 --> 00:25:12,079
the caring and loving nature of the character
and how she will defend those she cares about

267
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:17,081
without hesitation or limits. Yeah, the movie
was definitely rated R. I definitely remember

268
00:25:17,202 --> 00:25:22,144
being blown away by the level of violence in
her Wild West story. In a Western film, you

269
00:25:22,204 --> 00:25:27,767
tend to see people get shot in the head. Moving
on to Bruce Wayne, aka Batman, he was voiced

270
00:25:27,807 --> 00:25:28,908
by Jensen Ackles,

271
00:25:32,334 --> 00:25:38,937
to ever voice the character. He does a fantastic
job. What he lacks in like, Kevin Conroy's

272
00:25:39,177 --> 00:25:46,341
deep, gruff perfection, I think he adds in character.
I agree with you. Jensen Ackles, I think, has

273
00:25:46,381 --> 00:25:51,504
been the second best. I really like his Batman
performance. Now from Batman, Martian Manhunter

274
00:25:51,524 --> 00:25:57,547
said he learned courage, which I think everyone
displayed on the world of Skartaris. It's a

275
00:25:57,587 --> 00:26:03,191
dangerous place, but Bruce's true courage was
tested when he made the decision to stand up

276
00:26:03,211 --> 00:26:09,894
to Deimos by refusing to kill Diana and Moriah,
especially after revealing earlier that he

277
00:26:09,934 --> 00:26:16,878
felt, essentially, that everyone was evil and
that evil was unstoppable. Warlord responded

278
00:26:17,138 --> 00:26:23,082
that while that may be true, good men stand
up to the darkness within them and fight evil

279
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:29,465
for those who can't, regardless of whether they
can win or not. Bruce would have died for defying

280
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:35,156
Deimos, But his courage to stand up for what
he felt was right in the end was rewarded by

281
00:26:35,216 --> 00:26:40,498
Warlord when he saved Bruce from Deimos' bullet.
Speaking of that, I thought it was weird that

282
00:26:40,538 --> 00:26:45,080
Deimos was firing a gun to begin with. He was
a sorcerer. There's some weird choices made

283
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:50,542
through that. That's in keeping with Skartaris,
though. Skartaris is like the center of the

284
00:26:50,582 --> 00:26:54,504
world. It's like world at the core of the planet.
But things from like the Bermuda Triangle get

285
00:26:54,644 --> 00:27:01,111
sucked into there. So Warlord uses a gun quite
frequently. Really? That I did not know. OK,

286
00:27:01,131 --> 00:27:05,574
we'll have to do like a duel episode with Warlord
at some point. But yeah, it just seemed like

287
00:27:05,594 --> 00:27:11,479
a weird hodgepodge of elements going on within
this. What I thought was a swords and sorcery

288
00:27:11,519 --> 00:27:15,922
type world and actually turns out to be quite
a myriad of things. Yeah, that's kind of what

289
00:27:15,962 --> 00:27:21,586
makes Scartaris unique from other swords and
sorcery worlds, isn't the fact that the sorcerer

290
00:27:21,626 --> 00:27:26,534
can find a fucking gun and be like, I'm going
to use this as like a magic wand. But like,

291
00:27:26,714 --> 00:27:31,796
why shoot a gun when you can turn into a giant
snake though, am I right? Or do both, why not?

292
00:27:32,756 --> 00:27:39,199
Hahaha Moving on to Clark Kent, aka Superman,
he was voiced by Darren Criss, who did a great

293
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:44,261
job voicing the character in Superman Man of
Tomorrow, and here as well. I don't know what

294
00:27:44,301 --> 00:27:51,344
it is, but he just sounds like a good, optimistic
man. I think he might actually be the second

295
00:27:51,364 --> 00:27:56,738
best Superman voice after Tim Daly, from the
new Superman Adventures. I buy it. Yeah, now

296
00:27:56,778 --> 00:28:02,141
from Superman, Martian Manhunter said he learned
faith. I thought for a character that's an

297
00:28:02,321 --> 00:28:10,206
alien, Superman was perfect to do a 1950s sci-fi
story with, as those often revolve around paranoia

298
00:28:10,386 --> 00:28:16,009
of the other. This was during the time of the
McCarthy hearings and general public mistrust

299
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:22,612
of anyone different or foreign, which in the
melting pot of America, was hard to tell visually.

300
00:28:23,053 --> 00:28:29,315
But Superman represents the very best of American
values, and in spite of everyone's mistrust,

301
00:28:29,636 --> 00:28:35,498
Clark refused to kill out of fear because he
had faith that those people, no matter what

302
00:28:35,518 --> 00:28:41,500
they looked like or said, were good. And not
just Bruce or Diana, but even Martian Manhunter,

303
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,463
an alien that Clark didn't recognize. The movie
proved and reinforced that Clark and Bruce

304
00:28:47,803 --> 00:28:53,205
are opposites in that sense, because Clark believes
that everyone's good, and Bruce believes that

305
00:28:53,225 --> 00:28:57,302
everyone's evil. But if you're a white Martian,
though, he won't hesitate to kill your ass.

306
00:28:57,322 --> 00:29:02,444
I mean, they attacked him first. Sort of. One
of the guys was reaching for his gun. Right,

307
00:29:02,544 --> 00:29:07,225
right, right. So those were the three protagonists
of the movie. There's some other characters

308
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:12,867
that I want to touch on, including Martian Manhunter.
We last saw him during a cameo in Green Lantern.

309
00:29:12,987 --> 00:29:19,949
Beware my power. Apparently, perhaps sometime
after that, he was kidnapped by Lobo and imprisoned

310
00:29:20,029 --> 00:29:25,504
on Warworld. We have no idea if Superman or
Batman were kidnapped at the same time or when

311
00:29:25,664 --> 00:29:31,107
Wonder Robin was taken from her universe, particularly
because Martian Manhunter said it took him

312
00:29:31,267 --> 00:29:37,391
lifetimes to psychically reach them. Now he
could mean like animated short lifetimes or

313
00:29:37,431 --> 00:29:42,293
he could be a Martian Manhunter from a completely
different universe who's been trapped a very,

314
00:29:42,333 --> 00:29:48,637
very long time. I wouldn't be surprised if it
was the latter because he seemingly sacrifices

315
00:29:48,677 --> 00:29:54,672
himself in the end. to destroy Warworld after
he merges with a white Martian. If this was

316
00:29:54,712 --> 00:29:59,575
the main tomorrow vs Martian Manhunter, at least
he went out like a boss though, because he

317
00:29:59,595 --> 00:30:04,658
was mentally manipulating everyone, not just
the Trinity during the illusions, but also

318
00:30:04,778 --> 00:30:09,881
Lobo, Mongul, and some random white Martian
in the end. Yeah, it was quite the telepathic

319
00:30:09,921 --> 00:30:14,764
feat they had going on. I think if he is gone,
that's kind of a waste because he's such a

320
00:30:14,824 --> 00:30:19,531
quintessential part of the League. Or at least
should be. Right, exactly, I think that's one

321
00:30:19,571 --> 00:30:25,516
of the reasons why I think he might be a multiversal
Martian manhunter. Again, not 100% sure on

322
00:30:25,556 --> 00:30:30,640
that though. I guess we'll have to see how Crisis
on Infinite Earths plays out next year. I also

323
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:35,344
wanted to touch on Mungo. He was the biggest
disappointment for me in the movie. I was looking

324
00:30:35,404 --> 00:30:40,228
forward to him because he hasn't made too many
appearances in the cartoons or anywhere outside

325
00:30:40,268 --> 00:30:43,711
the comics really, but he's a pretty powerful
badass villain.

326
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:52,891
enslaving their citizens and pitting their best
warriors in gladiatorial matches. That was

327
00:30:52,971 --> 00:30:57,753
nowhere to be seen here. Instead the writers
made it so that Mongol and the planet were

328
00:30:57,793 --> 00:31:04,415
empowered by negative emotions, which was a
weird decision. I thought that was really weird.

329
00:31:04,955 --> 00:31:11,277
I feel like we never got a great sense for the
power of Warworld as a weapon. It's a planet

330
00:31:11,317 --> 00:31:16,138
covered in planet destroying energy cannons.
And we never got a good look at it. Like the

331
00:31:16,158 --> 00:31:22,781
whole concept of war world was super vague,
which I feel was like a super mistake on behalf

332
00:31:22,821 --> 00:31:28,463
of the filmmakers. Like what were the stakes?
We were told that war world was the ultimate

333
00:31:28,483 --> 00:31:33,485
weapon in the universe, but it was never shown.
And in a film, you should always show, not

334
00:31:33,545 --> 00:31:38,928
tell. Yeah, the only time we got a good, like
perspective of the entire planet and the scale

335
00:31:38,968 --> 00:31:44,798
of it was when it blew up. And at that point,
who gave a shit? Exactly. Even after watching

336
00:31:44,818 --> 00:31:48,962
this movie, I don't even really know what Mongol
does. I know he has an energy staff that he

337
00:31:48,982 --> 00:31:53,105
can threaten people with. But I don't know if
it's just a glow stick, if it even fucking

338
00:31:53,185 --> 00:31:58,269
works. What can he do? He didn't do anything
in this movie. I mean, he's kind of like dark

339
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:04,515
side light. You know, he's strong, he's fast,
he's pretty much invulnerable. He could teleport

340
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:09,879
and he could like shoot out energy beams. He's
also really smart. But yeah, I don't think

341
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:15,067
you got a sense for really any of that in this
movie. He was just a guy who couldn't follow

342
00:32:15,087 --> 00:32:21,432
through on his threats, got his ass beat by
Lobo, and then got blown up. Weak ass villain.

343
00:32:21,912 --> 00:32:26,416
And it was really unclear too as to whether
or not, like, he was the one in control of

344
00:32:26,476 --> 00:32:31,319
Warworld, or Warworld was the one in control
of him. He kept referring to Warworld as a

345
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:36,343
she, which was kind of confusing. That's not
from the comics? I don't believe so, not that

346
00:32:36,423 --> 00:32:39,525
I know of. Hmm. But let's get into the story
highlights.

347
00:32:47,182 --> 00:32:52,646
The first act is a western. It follows Wonderoman,
a nameless cowgirl who wanders via horseback,

348
00:32:52,806 --> 00:32:58,371
into a town whose citizens are holed up in a
run-down church by hired law enforcement led

349
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:04,216
by Jonah Hex. After an altercation at the local
saloon between Wonderoman and one of Hex's

350
00:33:04,297 --> 00:33:09,961
men, Wonderoman learns from Hex that the entire
townsfolk had their land repossessed after

351
00:33:10,002 --> 00:33:15,678
failing to make payments while searching for
gold. The townsfolk together then robbed the

352
00:33:15,718 --> 00:33:21,303
bank to get back the gold they used to pay for
their stakes. As Hex asks Wonder Woman to join

353
00:33:21,343 --> 00:33:27,228
his team, other members brutally murder a young
girl's parents as they attempt to flee. Wonder

354
00:33:27,268 --> 00:33:32,593
Woman saves the girl and joins the side of the
townsfolk, defending them from Hex and his

355
00:33:32,673 --> 00:33:37,917
men. When she learns via her lasso of truth
that Hex plans on blowing the rest of the church

356
00:33:38,077 --> 00:33:43,430
up with the people inside, Wonder Woman hijacks
the train carrying the explosives while the

357
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:48,851
townsfolk evacuate. Despite Wonder Woman blowing
up the church and the gold stashed inside,

358
00:33:49,191 --> 00:33:55,293
ridding both sides of it, Hex still kills one
of the townsfolk's other defenders, a man named

359
00:33:55,413 --> 00:34:01,755
Batlash. Wonder Woman nearly beats Hex to death
before writing off on her own. I thought this

360
00:34:01,775 --> 00:34:05,976
was a pretty cool act, actually. I think it
was the best out of the three stories, largely

361
00:34:06,016 --> 00:34:11,337
because the action, Wonder Woman was really
badass with her lasso and she was a great shot.

362
00:34:11,794 --> 00:34:15,796
Yeah, I thought this was a great story, too.
I'm really torn as to which of the three is

363
00:34:15,836 --> 00:34:21,039
my favorite. I actually think the Batman one
is my favorite just because it does so much

364
00:34:21,099 --> 00:34:25,422
justice to the character of Warlord, whereas
I really didn't care for what they did with

365
00:34:25,462 --> 00:34:31,186
Jonah Hex in this story. Like, they never told
his backstory in this movie, maybe because

366
00:34:31,226 --> 00:34:36,009
it's so tragic and it would have made him sympathetic
and they just needed him to be the bad guy

367
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:41,346
here. I'm not sure. I thought it was weird how
Wonder Woman had to divert the train in order

368
00:34:41,386 --> 00:34:46,868
to hit the church when the train was initially
supposed to hit the church anyway according

369
00:34:46,928 --> 00:34:50,929
to Jonah Hex's plan. I don't think it was supposed
to hit the church. I think they were just going

370
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:55,530
to blow it up when it got near the church. Probably
like light the fuse and then jump off the train

371
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:59,531
or something like that. But it's fucking Wonder
Woman. She has a better way. I thought that

372
00:34:59,551 --> 00:35:04,673
was actually cool for you because there really
was no good side here. There was just one side

373
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:10,308
that was oppressive and one that was not. Moving
on to Act 2, that's a fantasy adventure in

374
00:35:10,328 --> 00:35:15,913
the world of Skartaris. It follows Batman, a
sword wielding mercenary, who is part of a

375
00:35:15,973 --> 00:35:22,138
failed attack on the kingdom of Shambhala, which
is led by the king known as Warlord. When Batman

376
00:35:22,238 --> 00:35:27,582
offers to take Warlord and his men to the evil
sorcerer who hired the mercenaries, Deimos,

377
00:35:27,923 --> 00:35:33,054
in exchange for his freedom, Warlord accepts
the offer. The group is attacked by dangerous

378
00:35:33,074 --> 00:35:38,815
Skartarin wildlife on their journey to Deimos'
castle and suffers several casualties. Batman

379
00:35:38,855 --> 00:35:43,597
and Warlord are the only two to make it inside
the castle where they have to outsmart booby

380
00:35:43,617 --> 00:35:49,778
traps and outrun a Minotaur. After Batman tricks
Warlord into freeing him from his chains, he

381
00:35:49,818 --> 00:35:54,920
abandons Warlord to be killed by the Minotaur
and makes his way to Deimos alone, where he

382
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,761
finds Moriah, Warlord's ally who was lost during
the journey to the castle, and a confused Wonder

383
00:36:00,801 --> 00:36:07,252
Woman. Deimos reveals that he hired Batman to
bring Warlord to him before ordering Batman

384
00:36:07,272 --> 00:36:13,134
to kill Moriah and Wonder Roman. When Batman
refuses, Deimos attacks him, but Batman is

385
00:36:13,194 --> 00:36:20,277
saved by Warlord, who managed to kill the Minotaur.
They all gang up on Deimos, who flees. Warlord

386
00:36:20,437 --> 00:36:25,799
asks them to join his cause against Deimos,
but Batman and Wonder Roman decline and depart

387
00:36:25,899 --> 00:36:31,446
via a portal. Like I said, this is probably
my favorite of the three stories. Not just

388
00:36:31,486 --> 00:36:37,189
for Batman, although Batman is cool in it, but
primarily for Warlord. The world of Skartaris

389
00:36:37,289 --> 00:36:42,212
is just intense and I thought they did a good
job of capturing that. I thought it was really

390
00:36:42,352 --> 00:36:47,675
out of character when Batman abandoned Warlord
to be killed by the Minotaur. And, you know,

391
00:36:47,695 --> 00:36:52,918
it turns out later that he was hired to let
Warlord die, but then at the end he ended up

392
00:36:53,058 --> 00:36:57,060
fighting alongside him, so it felt kind of flippy
floppy in that regard. I'm surprised actually

393
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:01,779
that Warlord didn't just straight up murder
Batman. for betraying him like that earlier

394
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:06,563
in the story. Well, I think it's because he
saw that he wasn't gonna kill Mariah and Wonder

395
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:11,687
Woman, that he realized this guy has some good
in him. And I agree, Batman is definitely out

396
00:37:11,707 --> 00:37:17,332
of character in this story. I don't even almost
see it as Batman, it's pretty much Conan. But

397
00:37:17,552 --> 00:37:23,156
I'm just a sucker for good fantasy action, I
guess. Act 3 is a paranoid sci-fi thriller

398
00:37:23,196 --> 00:37:26,279
that follows Agent Clark Kent of the Central
Bureau of

399
00:37:29,494 --> 00:37:35,217
interrogate a group of six people being held
at a 1950s diner after they witnessed a UFO

400
00:37:35,297 --> 00:37:41,240
sighting. While asking the people questions,
Clark uncovers their fears that one of them

401
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:46,523
may be an alien in disguise controlling their
thoughts, with the Foreign Secretary Diana

402
00:37:46,584 --> 00:37:52,707
Prince and the Highway Patrol Officer Bruce
Wayne being among the chief suspects. As tensions

403
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:58,739
rise, Clark begins to hear music. When Bruce
and Diana privately reveal to Clark that they

404
00:37:58,919 --> 00:38:04,903
also hear the music, they accidentally touch,
flooding each other's minds with strange visions.

405
00:38:05,423 --> 00:38:10,947
In the chaos, Faraday pulls his gun on Bruce
and Diana, accusing them of being the aliens,

406
00:38:11,327 --> 00:38:16,451
and when one of the people, a trucker named
Potter, reaches for Clark's gun, Clark shoves

407
00:38:16,491 --> 00:38:22,315
him away to defend Bruce and Diana, accidentally
sending Potter flying into a jukebox and breaking

408
00:38:22,355 --> 00:38:22,875
his neck.

409
00:38:26,494 --> 00:38:32,817
are white Martians, who attack Faraday and chase
Clark, Bruce, and Diana. As the three flee

410
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:38,940
in a car and fend off attacking white Martians,
they eventually reach a barn with a large spaceship

411
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:45,424
crashed on top of it. Upon entering the ship,
they find a green Martian, as does Faraday

412
00:38:45,444 --> 00:38:50,927
shortly after when he catches up with them.
After Clark knocks Faraday out when Faraday

413
00:38:50,947 --> 00:38:57,050
shoots him because he thought he was an alien
too, the spaceship fades away to reveal Warworld,

414
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:03,892
which also looks like the inside of a spaceship.
It was kind of interesting watching this after

415
00:39:04,012 --> 00:39:10,914
our review of Secret Invasion, which was supposed
to be a paranoid sci fi. But I think this short

416
00:39:11,134 --> 00:39:17,196
did a much better job of making the viewer feel
the paranoia of like, who's an alien, who's

417
00:39:17,256 --> 00:39:22,677
not, then Secret Invasion did. For sure. Yeah,
I thought it was a great twist when we see

418
00:39:22,717 --> 00:39:28,203
the guy with the broken neck. say, oh, I guess
I'm the alien. And then all of a sudden, everybody

419
00:39:28,223 --> 00:39:34,506
was the alien. I was like, oh, shit. I thought
this third story was OK. I think it was largely

420
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:41,249
hampered by its need to actually progress the
story into World and transition into that last

421
00:39:41,389 --> 00:39:48,391
act. Whereas the previous two acts were largely
standalone. Right. Yeah, that's fair. I did

422
00:39:48,452 --> 00:39:53,153
enjoy seeing Clark, Diana and Bruce just like
as civilians taking on these Martians, though.

423
00:39:53,398 --> 00:39:59,339
That was pretty cool. Like Bruce with the whole
knocking off the cap of the fuel truck and

424
00:39:59,539 --> 00:40:04,241
Clark firing the flare gun. That was cool. It's
like I need to remember that for the zombie

425
00:40:04,281 --> 00:40:10,203
apocalypse. I also thought it was interesting
that the reason they justified the black and

426
00:40:10,223 --> 00:40:17,245
white coloring of the story was so that Warworld
could keep Superman away from light and therefore

427
00:40:17,265 --> 00:40:22,691
his powers. Yellow light, yeah. In Act 4, we
learn from the Green Martian, revealed to be

428
00:40:22,731 --> 00:40:28,053
the hero Martian Manhunter, that they're all
currently on Warworld, and that Superman, Batman,

429
00:40:28,073 --> 00:40:33,455
and Wonder Woman have been living telepathic
illusions forcibly cast by Martian Manhunter

430
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:40,418
as a result of torture in order to stir negative
emotions that energize Warworld. Martian Manhunter's

431
00:40:40,458 --> 00:40:45,860
plan to call out to the Trinity to save him
worked, though the bounty hunter Lobo finds

432
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:50,830
and subdues the heroes before they can escape.
Just when I thought we had gotten all the answers,

433
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:56,252
the whole mystery aspect of the movie keeps
going with Lobo's introduction. Cause like

434
00:40:56,292 --> 00:41:01,993
literally he comes out of nowhere and he's really
vague by saying like, oh, aren't you the cutest

435
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:06,555
or something like that. And then like they wake
up elsewhere on the war world planet and stuff

436
00:41:06,575 --> 00:41:09,816
and you have no idea what happened. You're still
not getting all the answers you need. It's

437
00:41:09,836 --> 00:41:14,757
quite the frustrating film I found. Even after
we thought we were getting a grasp on what

438
00:41:14,797 --> 00:41:20,477
was going on. movie still kept up the confusion
but not like in an interesting way. It was,

439
00:41:20,497 --> 00:41:24,601
I just remember being really frustrated. Yeah
it was definitely frustrating, definitely not

440
00:41:24,921 --> 00:41:30,506
intriguing in any way. Lobo was a surprise,
I don't actually remember him from the trailers

441
00:41:30,546 --> 00:41:35,250
although he may have been. The Trinity awakens
alone on Warworld and discovers that the people

442
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:40,574
they interacted with in their visions were clones
of people that had been captured by Warworld.

443
00:41:40,914 --> 00:41:45,710
They find their superhero costumes and decide
to rescue Marshal Manhunter. who's been taken

444
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:51,255
to Lobo to Warworld's leader, Mongul. I kind
of wonder how each of them knew which costume

445
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:56,540
belonged to them. I wonder if Diana reached
for Batman's costume first or something like

446
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:00,083
that. It would have been interesting for sure
to see Batman wear Wonder Woman's costume.

447
00:42:00,503 --> 00:42:06,128
Ha ha ha. Mongul reveals to Martian Manhunter
that millennia ago, Warworld established a

448
00:42:06,168 --> 00:42:12,033
telepathic link with him, promising him power.
After killing its former inhabitants, the Largus,

449
00:42:12,658 --> 00:42:18,460
Mongol found he was unable to activate Warworld's
weapon systems, though Warworld told him the

450
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:23,722
key lied within the Martian race. Mongol and
Warworld traveled the multiverse in search

451
00:42:23,742 --> 00:42:29,084
of Martians. They found white Martians, though
they needed Lobo's help to find the last green

452
00:42:29,244 --> 00:42:35,287
one. Still unable to find the key, Mongol used
Martian Manhunter's telepathic powers to fuel

453
00:42:35,347 --> 00:42:40,449
more negativity for Warworld, though he decides
in the moment to kill Martian Manhunter to

454
00:42:40,489 --> 00:42:45,352
instill planet-wide despair. I don't know, Mungle's
motivations are just kind of weird here. It

455
00:42:45,372 --> 00:42:50,296
doesn't make sense to really kill your most
powerful fuel source for this weapon that you're

456
00:42:50,316 --> 00:42:56,241
trying to activate, as well as, you know, kill
the one being that may be able to unlock the

457
00:42:56,281 --> 00:43:00,464
power of the weapon you're holding. Just a lot
of weird motivational stuff. It was really

458
00:43:00,524 --> 00:43:05,749
weird that he would decide to do that. He needs
Martian Manhunter. So why would he kill him?

459
00:43:05,929 --> 00:43:11,393
Just, it's just bad writing. Before Mungle can
kill Martian Manhunter, Loba disables his bonds.

460
00:43:11,638 --> 00:43:17,301
so that Martian Manhunter can kill Mongol instead
and Lobo can take over Warworld. As Superman,

461
00:43:17,321 --> 00:43:22,143
Batman, and Wonder Woman reach them and begin
fighting off White Martians, Martian Manhunter

462
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:28,227
disables Mongol and reveals that the key to
Warworld is a merged green and white Martian

463
00:43:28,547 --> 00:43:32,629
because those races have been at war with each
other forever and the Largus believed that

464
00:43:32,649 --> 00:43:37,872
they would never work together. After merging
with the White Martian, Martian Manhunter activates

465
00:43:37,932 --> 00:43:44,477
Warworld and turns its weapons on itself. Before
Warworld explodes, a mysterious harbinger arrives

466
00:43:44,737 --> 00:43:50,462
and teleports the Trinity to safety, telling
them that the lives lost on Warworld is nothing

467
00:43:50,482 --> 00:43:57,108
compared to the threat of an upcoming crisis.
Now talk about Deus Ex Machina. Absolutely.

468
00:43:57,248 --> 00:44:02,893
So dumb. There was no reason why they couldn't
get to a Zeta Beam transporter and get themselves

469
00:44:02,913 --> 00:44:10,342
to safety. It was all just so rushed and unnecessary.
I absolutely hated the fourth act of this film.

470
00:44:10,422 --> 00:44:16,064
None of it was good, in my opinion. No, I mean,
I thought the last few minutes of Secret Invasion

471
00:44:16,104 --> 00:44:21,945
were bad. This one was even more abrupt and
just out of the blue. I just remember thinking

472
00:44:21,985 --> 00:44:26,627
like, is that it? Like, there's got to be some
kind of like after credit scene or something

473
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:31,588
like that. But there wasn't. No, no, there's
no resolution. And I really hate when films

474
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:37,446
do this. They'll end the film just to set up
the next film and not have a resolution. It's

475
00:44:37,566 --> 00:44:42,828
not a good way to do your film. Like audiences
need that story resolution. It's fine if you

476
00:44:42,848 --> 00:44:47,910
set up another one, but make sure that you at
least see the bad guy die or something like

477
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:53,232
that, you know? Right. Exactly. And who is Harbinger?
Can you tell me? Because I've never read Crisis.

478
00:44:53,933 --> 00:44:59,895
She was like a messenger for Pariah in Crisis
on Infinite Earth. Like she's the one who helped

479
00:44:59,935 --> 00:45:05,277
him rally all the heroes together to face the
oncoming threat. Hmm. Although she looks way

480
00:45:05,297 --> 00:45:11,594
different. than they depicted her in this movie.
Talk about character design. Besides Mongol,

481
00:45:11,614 --> 00:45:17,219
this has to be the worst adaptation from the
comics that I've ever seen. It looks more like

482
00:45:17,399 --> 00:45:23,004
Nova from Marvel. That's what I thought. Yeah,
I was like total ripoff. The final act did

483
00:45:23,024 --> 00:45:27,047
have some decent action on behalf of Superman,
Batman and Wonder Woman. It was cool to see

484
00:45:27,067 --> 00:45:32,776
them kick ass and stuff. I did think that. Lobo
turning on Mongol was a little bit convenient

485
00:45:32,836 --> 00:45:36,399
until I realized that he was actually being
manipulated by a martial man hunter And then

486
00:45:36,439 --> 00:45:41,083
it's kind of seemed to make more sense But I
mean even that played largely into like my

487
00:45:41,123 --> 00:45:47,348
frustration with the story Like a lot of it
on first viewing feels very empty and strange

488
00:45:47,448 --> 00:45:52,493
motivation wise until you get more information
But you know the answers all come in piecemeal

489
00:45:52,533 --> 00:45:57,217
and they're not satisfying I guess the action
at the end was good again the whole time. I

490
00:45:57,237 --> 00:46:01,644
was just wondering like Why aren't the white
Martians bigger threats for a Superman, Batman

491
00:46:01,664 --> 00:46:06,547
and Wonder Woman? They should be. Absolutely.
Well, Batman had fire. True. That actually

492
00:46:06,587 --> 00:46:11,911
was cool how he used that. But I don't know,
the whole end just felt so cheap because it

493
00:46:11,931 --> 00:46:17,314
just felt like I was watching a really bad trailer
for the next movie and not even a trailer,

494
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:21,677
just, you know, like as a setup for something
else that I'm not going to be able to watch

495
00:46:21,697 --> 00:46:28,226
for another year. It was a commercial. It was
an advertisement. And I feel like robbed. Like

496
00:46:28,246 --> 00:46:32,687
this whole thing was just a gimmick to plug
the next movie. Yeah, I think that Tomorrowverse

497
00:46:32,747 --> 00:46:37,389
could definitely have gone without this film.
It seems like the most inconsequential DC animated

498
00:46:37,429 --> 00:46:42,571
movie ever. As I mentioned earlier, I would
have been much happier if this was just an

499
00:46:42,612 --> 00:46:48,834
anthology collection featuring Elseworld shorts.
Overall, the film's anthological approach to

500
00:46:48,874 --> 00:46:56,337
story structure and genre is interesting, but
ultimately the film's disappointing and convoluted

501
00:46:56,377 --> 00:47:02,492
final act diminishes the film's overall appeal.
It's hard to knock the film too much because

502
00:47:02,532 --> 00:47:08,194
I would say three out of its four acts were
fairly good, but the final act just really

503
00:47:08,294 --> 00:47:14,757
ruins it. And because of that, I'm giving this
two and a half stars out of five, a rotten

504
00:47:14,797 --> 00:47:20,899
rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Yeah, I think if
the movie had done a better job of setting

505
00:47:20,959 --> 00:47:27,694
up early on some foreshadowing or hints as to
what exactly was going on here. kind of clued

506
00:47:27,854 --> 00:47:33,636
audiences in better along the way as we go through
these other interesting stories, I think it

507
00:47:33,656 --> 00:47:37,898
would have been much more successful. I also
think, you know, they could have done a much

508
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:43,640
better job with Mongol in the ending, of course,
but the individual anthology stories, I think,

509
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,742
mostly hit the mark they were trying to. So
I agree. Two and a half stars. It was an interesting

510
00:47:48,842 --> 00:47:53,924
idea at the very least, and maybe worthwhile
to explore. Hopefully next time, though, they

511
00:47:54,025 --> 00:47:58,555
do a better job if they do something like this
again. Right, right. But that does it for this

522
00:48:52,276 --> 00:48:58,320
leading up to our team duel for episode 350
where we're gonna pit the Doom Patrol against

523
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:02,762
the Guardians of the Galaxy. Yeah, next week
we're gonna learn who will win in a fight between

524
00:49:03,063 --> 00:49:08,666
Dorothy Spinner, the Chief's daughter, against
Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur. Yeah, that should

525
00:49:08,686 --> 00:49:12,428
be interesting. You know, Dorothy Spinner has
the power of imagination. She creates all these

526
00:49:12,728 --> 00:49:17,531
monsters to fight on her behalf, essentially.
And Moon Girl has her own monster in Devil

527
00:49:17,571 --> 00:49:22,073
Dinosaur. So I think this is gonna be a fun
matchup. Yeah, for sure. I'm looking forward

528
00:49:22,093 --> 00:49:27,164
to it. I loved Dorothy in season 2 of Doom Patrol.
But that does it for this episode, we want

529
00:49:27,184 --> 00:49:31,867

next week. Up up and away, true believers.

Absolutely nothing.
