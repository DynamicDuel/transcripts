00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,972
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,846 --> 00:00:29,811
Welcome to the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly
show where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:35,717
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:36,178 --> 00:00:42,144
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous
Joe. And in this episode, we are doing a review

5
00:00:42,465 --> 00:00:49,002
of DC Studios' first ever project, the animated
series Creature Commandos, written by James

6
00:00:49,062 --> 00:00:55,985
Gunn, the head of DC Studios. Was it a worthwhile
start to the new DC universe? You'll find out

7
00:00:56,005 --> 00:01:00,386
later on in our review. Before that we're going
to break down the comic book movie news from

8
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:06,168
the past week, of which there was just one major
news item, and that was the new official trailer

9
00:01:06,408 --> 00:01:11,850
for the Daredevil Born Again series for Disney+.

Joseph. If I could get you any gift from DC,

23
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:26,700
it would be a big belly burger. Cause it'll
make you fat. If I could get you any gift from

24
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:31,264
Marvel, it would be nothing because you wouldn't
deserve it. Oh good. Just what I've always

25
00:02:31,304 --> 00:02:37,909
wanted. Nothing for Marvel. I'll take a big
belly burger. Not gonna lie. Yeah you would.

But with that out of the way, quick to the No
Prize! A No Prize is an award Marvel used to

35
00:03:25,559 --> 00:03:31,123
give out to fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel
No Prize, is a digital award we post on Instagram

36
00:03:31,143 --> 00:03:37,630
for the person that we feel gave the best answer
to our question of the week. What Marvel or

37
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,893
DC theatrical film are you most looking forward
to in 2025? You basically had four options.

38
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:51,418
There's Captain America Brave New World, Thunderbolts,
Superman, and Fantastic Four First Steps. We

39
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:55,360
got three answers this week, so let's go ahead
and break down the honorable mentions as well

40
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,823
as the no prize winner. Our first honorable
mention goes to Mike Williams, who said, I'm

41
00:04:01,903 --> 00:04:08,083
very interested to see the new Captain America
movie. to see what role the Red Hulk's gonna

42
00:04:08,103 --> 00:04:14,707
play, and also how General Thunderbolt loss
is connected with the Thunderbolt movie that

43
00:04:14,727 --> 00:04:20,830
will be coming out later this year. Anyway,
as always, make mine Marvel. Take care. Yeah,

44
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,473
Captain America Brave New World, I believe the
tickets actually went on sale already. I'm

45
00:04:25,493 --> 00:04:29,835
really looking forward to that movie, mostly
for the appearance of Red Hulk and the leader.

46
00:04:30,216 --> 00:04:35,395
I kind of feel like they maxed out the coolness
factor of Sam Wilson in the Falcon and the

47
00:04:35,415 --> 00:04:38,957
Winter Soldier television series and all of
his appearances from Captain America the Winter

48
00:04:38,997 --> 00:04:43,981
Soldier and Civil War. We've seen a lot of what
he can do already. So I find myself more drawn

49
00:04:44,061 --> 00:04:48,884
toward the villains of Captain America Brave
New World than the hero. That being said, I'm

50
00:04:48,924 --> 00:04:52,847
excited Sam's getting his own movie. Yeah, I'm
pretty excited to see this as well, especially

51
00:04:52,967 --> 00:04:57,410
after the last trailer that we received. We
still don't know too much about the story,

52
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:02,074
I feel, but visually and action wise, it looks
like the movie is going to be incredible. If

53
00:05:02,114 --> 00:05:06,615
it can capture the same spirit as Captain America
the Winter Soldier, I think we're in for quite

54
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:11,516
the treat in a few weeks. Great answer Mike!
Our next honorable mention goes to... Miggy

55
00:05:11,536 --> 00:05:17,238
Mathingian who said... Hey what's up guys this
is Miggy and like Lizzie said in the Discord

56
00:05:17,258 --> 00:05:20,959
server, there's only one right answer this week.
It's Superman. It's going to be so good. It's

57
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:26,421
going to be everything that you want in a Superman
movie. Characterizes the hero really well.

58
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:32,719
And it's the only movie you should be looking
forward to. this year because Marvel sucks.

59
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:38,702
It's dying. Just let it die. You know, like
it's been dead. Why are you still trying to

60
00:05:38,722 --> 00:05:45,905
hang around? Stop it. That's right. Marvel is
dead. Bury it. Consider this mercy. I think

61
00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:50,408
Deadpool and Wolverine would probably disagree
there. I mean, the movie made over a billion

62
00:05:50,428 --> 00:05:55,471
dollars. Okay. Marvel's not dead. Marvel is
thriving. The Captain America movie is gonna

63
00:05:55,491 --> 00:05:59,875
be awesome. And like, Mickey's over here talking
about how the Superman movie is gonna be everything

64
00:05:59,895 --> 00:06:04,139
you want from a Superman movie. Like, he's seen
the film. What if it doesn't have everything

65
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:10,465
you want from a Superman movie? What if your
expectations are too high, my friend? Not possible.

66
00:06:10,845 --> 00:06:15,269
Superman is gonna nail it out of the park. I
cannot wait to see it. It's gonna be the next

67
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:21,074
best Superman movie since Superman the movie
and Man of Steel. Jonathan, do you remember

68
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:27,297
everything you were saying about Batman vs Superman
before that film came out? Hey, hey, the extended

69
00:06:27,357 --> 00:06:32,359
edition was everything I wanted. Do you remember
everything you were saying about Joker 2 before

70
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:38,983
that film came out? Too soon, man. Too soon.
Great answer, Miggy. But the winner of this

71
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:45,874
week's snow prize is Kat Stevenson, who said,
Hi, guys, it's Kat Stevenson here. And the

72
00:06:45,914 --> 00:06:51,098
theatrical release that I am most excited for
is Pedro Pascal. I mean, Fantastic Four First

73
00:06:51,138 --> 00:06:57,504
Steps. I'm so excited to see Pedro Pa- I mean,
the Fantastic Four finally get a good rendition.

74
00:06:58,085 --> 00:07:04,430
Like with Pedro Pa- I mean, Mr. Fantastic, Galactus,
Silver Surfer, the really cool rendition of

75
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:10,115
Pedro Pa- I mean, the thing. Everything looks
so good and I am so excited for Pedro Pa- I

76
00:07:10,155 --> 00:07:15,278
mean, the Fantastic Four to come to the MC-
Sounds like someone's really excited about

77
00:07:15,298 --> 00:07:20,300
the casting of Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards,
Mr. Fantastic in the Fantastic Four movie coming

78
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:26,101
out this summer. I will be honest, and I think
I've said it when he was cast and that was

79
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:32,223
announced last year, I'm not thrilled about
Pedro Pascal as Mr. Fantastic, but I do like

80
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:36,524
him as an actor and I do think he could pull
off the role. Yeah, the reason we mostly chose

81
00:07:36,604 --> 00:07:42,826
this as our no-prize win is because we've had
good We've had good Superman movies, but I

82
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:47,807
feel like we have yet to get a good Fantastic
Four movie. Yeah, I'm really hoping that this

83
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:53,049
will be the case. I'm really looking forward
to seeing Galactus done correctly on the big

84
00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:57,970
screen. I think the scale of that character
in theaters is just going to be mind-blowing.

85
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:03,191
I hope it is. And I really like the rest of
the cast as well. So here's hoping that the

86
00:08:03,251 --> 00:08:06,932
spirit of the Fantastic Four comics is truly
represented on film. You know, they've had

87
00:08:07,373 --> 00:08:12,654
multiple goes at it from the 90s movie that
didn't get released. The early 2000s franchise

88
00:08:12,814 --> 00:08:18,056
with Jessica Alba and of course, Fanta 4 Stick,
which came out in the 20 teens. They gotta

89
00:08:18,076 --> 00:08:22,598
get it right this time. I think they will. Yeah,
to go from one of the worst superhero movies

90
00:08:22,938 --> 00:08:26,900
to an actually good Fantastic Four movie would
be the greatest comeback in the history of

91
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,434
comic book franchises. Maybe, maybe. What I'm
hoping is that... It turns a lot of people

92
00:08:31,514 --> 00:08:35,318
on to the Fantastic Four. Like, I don't think
they have many fans, especially because their

93
00:08:35,358 --> 00:08:39,962
films have done so poorly. So I'm hoping that
the characters become A-list names in households

94
00:08:40,022 --> 00:08:44,707
just like the Avengers have. That would be best
case scenario. I guess we'll see. Great answer,

95
00:08:44,747 --> 00:08:48,610
Cat. You win this week's No Prize. If you're
the listener, want a shot at winning your own

96
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:52,974
No Prize, stay tuned to later on in this episode
when we'll be asking another question of the

97
00:08:52,994 --> 00:08:56,057
week. And now that that's done, onto the news.

98
00:09:01,494 --> 00:09:06,137
This past week we got the official trailer for
the upcoming Daredevil Born Again television

99
00:09:06,157 --> 00:09:12,221
series that's coming out on Disney Plus in just
a few months on March 4th. And damn, this show

100
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:16,323
looks good. Like I don't know what they had
planned before the whole series retooling,

101
00:09:16,343 --> 00:09:22,508
but whatever they did really worked because
this show looks not just like a great continuation

102
00:09:22,568 --> 00:09:27,810
of the Netflix series, it looks even more set.
in the superhero world. That was my big takeaway

103
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:33,213
from it because we got a lot of shots that really
seem to immerse the character more in the comic

104
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:37,495
book world of Marvel than he's ever been because
we see things like you know multiple costumes

105
00:09:37,795 --> 00:09:42,817
that he's worn including homages to his gray
battle suit and his yellow costume and things

106
00:09:42,857 --> 00:09:48,579
like that but we also got glimpses of other
characters like Muse, White Tiger, The Punisher.

107
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:54,690
It looks like a really exciting time. It's hard
for me to fathom how they could follow up the

108
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,933
masterpiece that was Daredevil season three.
And I have to say, after seeing this trailer,

109
00:10:00,253 --> 00:10:05,737
this is the first hope I've had that they could
actually do that. Yeah, I don't need Daredevil

110
00:10:05,757 --> 00:10:11,961
born again to surpass the quality of Netflix's
Daredevil season three because in my mind that

111
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:18,386
was almost perfection and it was the perfect
cap on that run. That being said, I do think

112
00:10:18,426 --> 00:10:25,058
it'll come close. It may not be a perfect season,
but I think it's highly unlikely drop the ball

113
00:10:25,098 --> 00:10:29,580
on this, you know, I think we're looking to
get like penguin levels of good here, but with

114
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:36,382
actual superheroics and vigilante fighting.
The action looks almost more brutal than what

115
00:10:36,402 --> 00:10:43,205
we got in Netflix. Yeah, I do have to say though,
I feel bad for the villain of Muse, not because

116
00:10:43,585 --> 00:10:48,548
he's a good guy or anything, he's a piece of
shit. But he just gets his ass kicked left

117
00:10:48,588 --> 00:10:53,109
and right nonstop in this trailer. There's at
least like four different shots of Daredevil

118
00:10:53,129 --> 00:10:57,871
just beating the ever loving shit out of him.
And I hope it doesn't quite go down like that

119
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:02,954
in the actual show. I hope there's an actual
good fight there to be had. Is Muse the guy

120
00:11:02,974 --> 00:11:08,656
who Murdoch slams the bottle on his eye and
then like kicks in his knee cap? No, that's

121
00:11:08,696 --> 00:11:13,578
a different guy. Daredevil's kicking some ass
in this trailer for sure. I wonder if Daredevil

122
00:11:13,778 --> 00:11:18,240
and Hector Alaya aka White Tiger are gonna fight
in this show. That'll be pretty interesting.

123
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,134
And I'm wondering how they're gonna bring back
Frank Castle into the fold. as another vigilante

124
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:27,697
warrior. I'm wondering how they're going to
bring Bullseye into the fold, because I can't

125
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:32,659
wait to see his return. Oh, man, Bullseye was
so good in Daredevil season three. Yeah. It's

126
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:37,862
just even if the show ends up not being good,
all the elements are there for it to be incredible,

127
00:11:38,222 --> 00:11:43,645
especially this diner discussion between Matt
Murdock and Wilson Fisk, who becomes the mayor

128
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:48,588
of New York during the course of the season.
It just seems so epic in the way that like

129
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:53,543
Robert De Niro and Al Pacino spoke in Heat.
or something like that, you know? These two

130
00:11:53,643 --> 00:11:58,746
iconic characters coming together and just their
discussion. Yeah, they're speaking like they're

131
00:11:59,147 --> 00:12:03,930
old exes or something like that. But of course
we know the nature of their past relationship

132
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,533
and it's as brutal as it gets. Yeah, they're
sworn mortal enemies, but they do seem to have

133
00:12:08,573 --> 00:12:13,096
some respect for each other as it appears here,
which is always interesting. Well, it appears

134
00:12:13,136 --> 00:12:18,240
like each character has kind of moved on. Like,
Wilson Fisk is moving out to be mayor and it

135
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,790
sounds like Matt Murdock hasn't been Daredevil
in a while. So it's going to be interesting

136
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:26,194
to see how they make their return to superhero
and super villain lives. Yeah, when Kingpin

137
00:12:26,434 --> 00:12:31,559
asks Matt Murdock why he stopped being Daredevil,
Matt Murdock mentions that a line was crossed.

138
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:36,283
And towards the end of the trailer, he mentions
how he was raised to believe in grace, but

139
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:40,606
he was also raised to believe in retribution.
And I wonder if that's one of the key themes

140
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:45,511
of this season, is him really struggling with
crossing the line due to his rage and how that

141
00:12:45,571 --> 00:12:50,923
correlates with his Catholic faith, which has
always been. big aspect of the character and

142
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:55,107
one of the things that makes him truly unique.
If you guys haven't caught up on Netflix startable

143
00:12:55,127 --> 00:12:59,971
seasons 1 through 3, I highly recommend you
do so before this next season drops because

144
00:13:00,432 --> 00:13:04,596
there's a lot of history with these characters
and it's such a damn good show it's well worth

145
00:13:04,616 --> 00:13:09,420
catching up on. Yeah, absolutely. But speaking
of quality television shows, that brings us

146
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,621
to our question of the week.

147
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:21,711
What Marvel or DC television series are you
most looking forward to in 2025? This is sort

148
00:13:21,731 --> 00:13:25,913
of a play on last week's question, but instead
of theatrical releases, we want to know what

149
00:13:25,993 --> 00:13:30,454
series you're most looking forward to seeing
at home. Yeah, for Marvel, they're really seeing

150
00:13:30,534 --> 00:13:36,436
Your Friendly Neighborhood, Spider-Man and then
Daredevil Born Again and then Ironheart is

151
00:13:36,476 --> 00:13:42,677
coming out this year, as well as Eyes of Wakanda,
Marvel Zombies and Wonder Man. There's not.

152
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:48,580
Too much more going on for DC. Of course, we
have Harley Quinn season five coming up. We

153
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:54,002
might be getting new seasons for My Adventures
with Superman, Batman Caped Crusader, and possibly

154
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:59,585
Creature Commandos, but also a new series on
Amazon titled Bat Family. Oh, is that the sequel

155
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:04,867
to Merry Little Batman? Yes, yep, that's right.

161
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:38,193
That does it for the news portion of this episode,
so now let's go ahead and move on to our main

162
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:45,477
event, where we review season one of the DC
Studios animated series, Creature Commandos.

163
00:15:13,907 --> 00:15:13,987
The

164
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:34,413
The story of Creature Commandos stems from the
events of Gunn's The Suicide Squad and subsequent

165
00:15:34,453 --> 00:15:40,056
Peacemaker spin-off series, both of which we
praised on this podcast in our reviews. This

166
00:15:40,076 --> 00:15:46,879
show, I'm mostly happy to say, is in keeping
with James Gunn's signature crass comedy ensembles

167
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,382
with heartfelt characterizations, and I definitely
recommend it to anyone who's a fan of Gunn's

168
00:15:52,443 --> 00:15:59,106
prior work, whether for DC or the MCU's Guardians
of the Galaxy franchise. Creature Commandos

169
00:15:59,246 --> 00:16:04,987
is only seven half-hour episodes, a pretty quick
watch, so make sure you do just that before

170
00:16:05,027 --> 00:16:10,569
listening any further to this spoiler review.
Now, I said I was mostly happy to say that

171
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:16,231
this show matched the crass comedy and emotional
weight of James Gunn's past works because I

172
00:16:16,271 --> 00:16:21,232
liked those past works. I'm a fan of James Gunn.
But there was also a part of me that hoped

173
00:16:21,292 --> 00:16:26,553
Gunn had matured to the point where he was able
to deliver on the emotional aspects of a story.

174
00:16:26,934 --> 00:16:32,918
without resorting to mature humor. And in this
first DC Studios project out of the gate, he

175
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:39,122
delivers arguably his most mature story to date,
one full of extreme violence and sexuality,

176
00:16:39,602 --> 00:16:45,266
which was somewhat discouraging. Now, I'm fairly
confident James Gunn's Superman movie coming

177
00:16:45,306 --> 00:16:50,650
out this summer is not going to match the tone
of Creature Commandos, but this show does present

178
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:56,562
a barrier to those looking to faithfully experience
DC's new cinematic universe. in the same way

179
00:16:56,662 --> 00:17:01,324
audiences were extremely faithful in seeing
everything Marvel Studios released during the

180
00:17:01,364 --> 00:17:06,026
Infinity Saga storyline. Yeah, well, I mean,
Creature Commandos was written, at least the

181
00:17:06,106 --> 00:17:12,268
specs were written by James Gunn prior to the
existence of the DCU. He wrote them when HBO

182
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:16,210
was looking for an animated series from him
coming off the success of Peacemaker Season

183
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:23,293
One. So the tone of Creature Commandos, I think,
is more in line with James Gunn's whole vision

184
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:29,476
for the Suicide Squad quadrant. of the DCU and
not necessarily representative of what the

185
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:35,379
tone is going to be for the DCU going forward.
True, that very may well be the case. Now I

186
00:17:35,479 --> 00:17:41,143
often criticize Marvel films for their over-reliance
on humor, and while I shouldn't be surprised

187
00:17:41,183 --> 00:17:46,806
that the guy who made the Guardians of the Galaxy
films was going to bring that humor to DC Studios,

188
00:17:46,986 --> 00:17:53,370
in part probably because it obviously sells
well given the MCU's financial success. I do

189
00:17:53,430 --> 00:18:00,394
tend to see DC characters and stories as being
above that, like DC's Oscar worthy, whereas

190
00:18:00,494 --> 00:18:06,497
Marvel's made more for the MTV Movie Awards
audience. So I never really wanted the DCU

191
00:18:06,537 --> 00:18:12,601
to be more like the MCU, and I'm slowly coming
to terms with the fact that while Marvel is

192
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:18,904
like the really popular sugary soda Coca-Cola,
and while I want DC to be like a fine bourbon,

193
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:25,028
not necessarily for everyone, DC actually ending
up like Pepsi is not the worst thing in the

194
00:18:25,068 --> 00:18:29,551
world, because there are a lot of people out
there of all ages that like Pepsi. I'm not

195
00:18:29,631 --> 00:18:34,775
one of them, but I can learn to like it, especially
if these mature projects like Creature Commandos

196
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:41,879
are relegated to niche animated fare. I like
how you compare DC to Pepsi. I think the analogy

197
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,543
works. You know, Marvel's red, DC's blue. DC
has a circular logo. It just made sense branding

198
00:18:47,563 --> 00:18:52,634
wise in my head. Pepsi is also dog shit, so.
Hey, fuck you, man. Don't make me defend Pepsi.

199
00:18:54,235 --> 00:18:59,998
Now because as a niche exploitation-esque project,
Creature Commandos really hits the nail on

200
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:05,842
the head. It feels very much like a successor,
as I mentioned, to the Suicide Squad in regards

201
00:19:05,882 --> 00:19:10,964
to its mission-based narrative and real stakes
in which any of your favorite characters could

202
00:19:11,004 --> 00:19:17,448
die. It feels like a passion project from James
Gunn, who does a tremendous job conveying that

203
00:19:17,488 --> 00:19:23,896
behind every monster is a tragedy. In fact,
each episode of the series is dedicated to

204
00:19:23,936 --> 00:19:29,199
showing us the past tragedy of an indiviDuel
character on the Creature Commandos team that

205
00:19:29,219 --> 00:19:34,943
helps us recognize the humanity in the characters
and view them as much more than just monsters.

206
00:19:35,244 --> 00:19:40,928
That was my big takeaway from the show was just
the tragedy of the characters. You're talking

207
00:19:40,948 --> 00:19:44,750
about some of the most tragic characters to
ever exist in comics. And really, you kind

208
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:50,370
of need that humor because of some of the horrific,
sad things that you see. happen on the screen.

209
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:54,731
You need that balance. Otherwise, it would just
be one heck of a depressing show. And in some

210
00:19:54,751 --> 00:20:00,492
ways it was, just due to how everything was
presented. Like, I don't think I've seen as

211
00:20:00,553 --> 00:20:06,754
many instances of dead children in a superhero
project. And it was actually surprising to

212
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:10,255
me. And I don't know if that's just because
I'm a dad now, but I was really affected by

213
00:20:10,295 --> 00:20:16,037
it. And that's not to say that the show was
shocking for shocking sake, because, you know,

214
00:20:16,077 --> 00:20:19,534
if you look at the story of the Creature Commandos
from the comic books, They went through some

215
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:23,716
dark shit. Like there was that whole arc where
they were commanded during World War II to

216
00:20:23,756 --> 00:20:28,399
kill that group of super soldier Nazi children.
Right. And they ended up doing it. And you

217
00:20:28,419 --> 00:20:32,521
know, there was a lot of dysfunction in the
team because of that. So all these tragic stories

218
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:36,363
that you were referring to when you say that
there's a tragedy behind every monster. And

219
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:42,427
I agree, that's the biggest idea that this series
sold. I agree. Their misfortunes result in

220
00:20:42,467 --> 00:20:48,875
a very cynical view of humanity and tone for
the series. which is in contrast to what I'm

221
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:55,241
hoping is a very hopeful tone for the upcoming
flagship film for DC that is Superman. But

222
00:20:55,261 --> 00:21:01,507
for a project starring literal monsters, a cynical
tone is appropriate, I feel, and shows some

223
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:08,473
value in cynicism over, say, optimism, because
cynicism tends to help people survive, giving

224
00:21:08,513 --> 00:21:14,462
these monsters the most human trait of all,
and that is the instinct to survive. That's

225
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:19,584
valid. I mean, like cynicism is one of my least
favorite traits that anybody could have. But

226
00:21:19,904 --> 00:21:24,386
I guess it is a valuable trait when it comes
to like soldiers out on the battlefield or

227
00:21:24,426 --> 00:21:28,348
on a mission or something like that. It's good
to be cynical and skeptical of everything and

228
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:32,910
everyone around you when your life is on the
line. Otherwise, yeah, I hope more people are

229
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:37,312
like Superman. Yeah, that's my hope for sure.
But, you know, when the zombie apocalypse breaks

230
00:21:37,412 --> 00:21:42,694
out, I will be the most cynical person on the
planet. Now the show revolves heavily around

231
00:21:42,754 --> 00:21:47,855
its cast of characters, but before we get into
our character breakdown, I want to touch on

232
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:53,557
the show's animation style, which I would actually
describe as this combination of the tomorrow

233
00:21:53,577 --> 00:21:59,419
versus cleanliness and unique character designs
with the quirkiness and charm of mature animated

234
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:05,080
favorites like Eon Flux and just a hint of anime
action. I wasn't actually looking forward to

235
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:11,078
this style of animation in the trailers, but
actually grew to love it. the action scenes,

236
00:22:11,298 --> 00:22:16,141
which were often coupled with some deep cut
song choices that would make Quentin Tarantino

237
00:22:16,181 --> 00:22:22,365
proud. It also doesn't hurt that, with the exception
of one character, the characters look like

238
00:22:22,405 --> 00:22:27,628
the actors who voice them, making it easier
to believe the performances and just making

239
00:22:27,648 --> 00:22:32,631
me really excited to see them all in live action
hopefully one day, maybe in Peacemaker Season

240
00:22:32,671 --> 00:22:38,146
2. Yeah, the animation was great. The violence
level. was shocking. It was almost or maybe

241
00:22:38,186 --> 00:22:42,928
even surpassed the level of gore that we saw
in the Hit Monkey series. Oh yeah, when you

242
00:22:42,948 --> 00:22:48,611
have like Dr. Phosphorus just like shoving his
hand like slowly through people's faces melting

243
00:22:48,631 --> 00:22:54,853
it off. I'm like, good, good gosh. Yeah, I think
it was more like invincible in that regard

244
00:22:54,893 --> 00:22:58,895
because, you know, the animation was a lot cleaner
than it was in Hit Monkey. Hit Monkey was a

245
00:22:58,915 --> 00:23:03,977
little bit more stylized. Like there was like
a lot of blood spray. Here there was less spray

246
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:08,582
and it was more just like splatter. I guess,
if you could discern the difference in my description.

247
00:23:09,082 --> 00:23:15,264
All I can say is I'm just glad I binged this
show while I was not eating. Yeah. Moving on

248
00:23:15,304 --> 00:23:20,546
to the character breakdown, starting off with
Rick Flagg Sr. He was voiced by Frank Gurlow

249
00:23:20,806 --> 00:23:26,827
of Crossbones fame in the MCU. I didn't recognize
his voice to me, he just sounded like a really

250
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:32,029
good voice actor. I had forgotten that Frank
Gurlow voiced the character. He was good in

251
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:36,990
the role and well cast as the father of Joel
Kinnaman. I do have to say though that this

252
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:43,053
character, more than any other character, looks
the least like the actor who voiced them. Rick

253
00:23:43,073 --> 00:23:48,415
Flack Sr. actually looks more like James Gunn,
with the white hair and beard, who we actually

254
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:54,738
see in animated form in every opening credits
of the show. I'm not sure why James Gunn decided

255
00:23:54,778 --> 00:24:00,280
to make Rick Flack Sr. look like him, considering
he didn't in the show's promo art, like he

256
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:05,770
had black hair, and Frank Urlow won't have white
hair. in the Superman movie because we've seen

257
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:11,673
behind the scenes photos of him on set as Rick
Flack Sr. That is a strange call and it's a

258
00:24:11,693 --> 00:24:16,775
weird way to insert yourself, allegedly, in
the story. I don't understand the justification

259
00:24:16,795 --> 00:24:21,477
for it at all. I just kind of miss Joel Kinnaman's
character. I wish he wouldn't have died in

260
00:24:21,617 --> 00:24:26,959
the Suicide Squad. Dude, we're all still heartbroken
about that. Even the guy who killed him, Peacemaker,

261
00:24:26,999 --> 00:24:31,321
was heartbroken about that. Yeah, I guess that
was a big part of Peacemaker's arc in his show.

262
00:24:31,921 --> 00:24:37,725
Speaking of arc. Rick Flagg Sr. begins the series
dealing with the loss of his son, Rick Flagg

263
00:24:37,765 --> 00:24:44,029
Jr., who died in the 2021 film, The Suicide
Squad. Princess Ilana Rostovic took advantage

264
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:49,553
of his sorrow in an attempt to manipulate him
into killing Cersei, the clairvoyant, the muscarine

265
00:24:49,593 --> 00:24:55,777
sorceress who foresaw Princess Rostovic destroying
the world. When the Amazonian expert Dr. MacPherson

266
00:24:55,917 --> 00:25:01,421
vouched for the captured Cersei's credibility,
Flagg teamed up with Eric Frankenstein to spy

267
00:25:01,461 --> 00:25:05,856
on Dr. MacPherson. only to learn that she had
been killed and replaced by the shapeshifter

268
00:25:05,896 --> 00:25:12,402
Clayface. After being put into a coma by Clayface,
Flag awoke briefly to warn Amanda Waller that

269
00:25:12,442 --> 00:25:18,968
she was wrong to send Task Force M back to Pakolistan
to kill Princess Rostovic, unaware that the

270
00:25:18,988 --> 00:25:25,894
princess had been working with Clayface to discredit
Dr. MacPherson. Flag was wrong, however, too

271
00:25:25,974 --> 00:25:31,274
optimistic and gullible as compared to the cynical
monsters he was trying to lead. whose disdain

272
00:25:31,294 --> 00:25:36,416
for the world and humankind actually helped
them see through the princess's manipulations.

273
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:40,298
Yeah, it's hard to speak about Rick Flag as
a character because while I wouldn't call him

274
00:25:40,618 --> 00:25:45,400
one dimensional or anything like that, he was
also probably the least interesting in a group

275
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:50,122
of literal freaks and monsters, you know? Oh,
totally. I actually thought Rick Flag Sr. was

276
00:25:50,142 --> 00:25:55,225
going to be the main character of the series,
but I was totally wrong. He was knocked out

277
00:25:55,245 --> 00:26:00,203
of the series like halfway through. basically,
and was involved in the climax or anything

278
00:26:00,243 --> 00:26:06,807
like that. Right. And he ended up getting manipulated
as well. Right. His whole arc is just him being

279
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:13,731
wrong, essentially, like I mentioned. So moving
on to the bride, she was voiced by Indira Varma,

280
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:19,654
who is a fantastic voice actress. It was just
a fantastic character as well. I cannot wait

281
00:26:19,694 --> 00:26:25,437
for more of her character in the announced upcoming
season for Creature Commandos. She was the

282
00:26:25,477 --> 00:26:29,379
most interesting character. Yeah, she kind of
had a chip on her shoulder, but you get into

283
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:33,303
her backstory and it's really easy to see why,
considering, you know, the people that she

284
00:26:33,363 --> 00:26:38,767
loved were killed by the people that she hates.
And so she just really had this bitter attitude

285
00:26:38,787 --> 00:26:43,631
toward everything. But I like the way they portrayed
her as this badass. It's not often that you

286
00:26:43,671 --> 00:26:48,555
get female characters who are this cynical.
I can't even really think of any off the top

287
00:26:48,575 --> 00:26:52,558
of my head because, like, you think of characters
like Black Widow and stuff like that. At least

288
00:26:52,598 --> 00:26:55,981
in the comics, they're closer to this version
of the character. But this version was so much

289
00:26:56,021 --> 00:27:00,765
more violent. than most other femme fatales
that you get. Yeah, she's like a super soldier

290
00:27:01,065 --> 00:27:06,349
black widow. Yeah. Now the bride was created
by Dr. Victor Frankenstein as a mate for his

291
00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:13,095
monstrous creation, Eric Frankenstein. Eric
didn't ask to be created and didn't wanna live

292
00:27:13,355 --> 00:27:20,320
unloved. So Victor created the bride for him,
though Eric was too impatient and uncouth for

293
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,885
her to bond with him. Victor cared more for
her, which turned into a romance between him

294
00:27:25,925 --> 00:27:32,115
and the bride, causing Eric to kill his creator
in jealousy. The bride, enraged by what Eric

295
00:27:32,155 --> 00:27:38,117
had done, fought him and fled, beginning a pattern
that would last centuries as Eric continued

296
00:27:38,137 --> 00:27:43,858
to stalk her across the planet. Life is a burden
for the bride and it's hardened her, but her

297
00:27:43,898 --> 00:27:48,980
experience makes her the perfect leader for
a team of monsters, as recognized by Amanda

298
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,940
Waller when she replaced Rick Flagg

299
00:27:55,786 --> 00:27:59,447
Yeah, that was one of the best quotes, I think,
in the show where Amanda Waller was like, we

300
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:03,168
need someone who's less of a whiny bitch and
someone who's more just a bitch. It was so

301
00:28:03,188 --> 00:28:10,610
good. Now, in the end, it's the bride alone
who recognizes that Princess Rostovic was exactly

302
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:15,631
the entitled narcissistic person that Cersei
claimed she was, though she killed the princess

303
00:28:15,751 --> 00:28:21,593
not because of what she would do, but because
she killed Nina Mazursky, the one person the

304
00:28:21,613 --> 00:28:27,140
bride had grown to care for. I thought that
was a fantastic story choice. The fact that

305
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:32,163
the bride was like, you know what, you're planning
on doing all of this horrible shit to humanity.

306
00:28:32,684 --> 00:28:37,587
I don't care at all about humanity. I'm just
going to kill you because you killed my friend.

307
00:28:38,228 --> 00:28:41,910
It was a fantastic ending and a great moment
for the character. I think the one thing missing

308
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,593
from the character of the bride was that she
didn't have four arms like she does in the

309
00:28:45,633 --> 00:28:49,736
comics. I wish they would have done that in
the series. Sometimes she has six arms in the

310
00:28:49,776 --> 00:28:55,483
comics. Hopefully they'll do that in subsequent
seasons. Moving on to Eric Frankenstein, he

311
00:28:55,503 --> 00:29:01,446
was voiced by David Harbour. This was the casting
that I was most excited about when it was announced,

312
00:29:02,047 --> 00:29:07,310
and I actually like him a lot more in this role
than the Red Guardian role for Marvel. He's

313
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:13,033
fantastic, although I don't love what they did
with the actual character. Yeah, we pit Frankenstein

314
00:29:13,073 --> 00:29:17,655
against Elsa Bloodstone in a Duel episode, and
the backstory of the character was actually

315
00:29:17,875 --> 00:29:22,986
pretty interesting, but the way he's characterized
in this show... they completely changed him

316
00:29:23,226 --> 00:29:29,449
and he was despicable. He was the worst fucking
character. I hated the guy. Yeah, in the comics,

317
00:29:29,489 --> 00:29:35,852
Frankenstein is this wise and noble figure,
but in the show, despite his somewhat likable

318
00:29:35,892 --> 00:29:41,114
buffoonery, he's cast very much like a violent
stalker, essentially a villain in the series,

319
00:29:41,134 --> 00:29:47,057
making him pretty uncomfortable to watch. But
also, it's somewhat in keeping with the literary

320
00:29:47,097 --> 00:29:52,838
character of Frankenstein's monster. who resents
life and demands affection. Mary Shelley's

321
00:29:52,878 --> 00:29:58,080
Frankenstein is probably my favorite story ever.
So I'm really curious to see where they take

322
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:03,321
the Eric Frankenstein character and see how
he grows. Hopefully he does. Do you think they're

323
00:30:03,341 --> 00:30:06,622
gonna try to redeem him? Or do you think they're
gonna double down and make him even more of

324
00:30:06,642 --> 00:30:12,024
an asshole? I don't know. I hope they don't
make it so that the bride falls in love with

325
00:30:12,064 --> 00:30:19,486
him. I hope Eric actually finds a new love and
the bride finds a new love Because they never

326
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:24,210
did that in the book. In fact, the character
of the bride kills herself rather than be with

327
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:29,515
Frankenstein's monster. Is he called Eric in
the books as well? No, no. I wonder why they

328
00:30:29,535 --> 00:30:33,159
call him Eric in this show. I don't know. I
think it was just to give him a name. Movie

329
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:39,004
gone to Nina Mazursky. She was voiced by Zoe
Chow, who I'm not too familiar with. She's

330
00:30:39,044 --> 00:30:44,329
been in a number of minor roles in various projects.
I did think she did a fantastic job voicing

331
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:49,131
the role. You know, like Frankenstein, Nina
Masursky was fairly different in this show

332
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:54,313
than she was in the comics. Here she's pretty
naive when in the comics she was a scientific

333
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:59,235
genius who actually helped create the Creature
Commandos. In recent comics, at least. Her

334
00:30:59,255 --> 00:31:04,498
father created the team in its earliest incarnation.
So that part, they got somewhat right in that

335
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:09,840
Dr. Masursky transformed his daughter out of
care and necessity for her survival. James

336
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:15,198
Gunn has a habit of killing off innocents in
his works. So I shouldn't have been surprised

337
00:31:15,258 --> 00:31:20,262
that Nina did not survive to the end, but her
death had a large impact on the bride, and

338
00:31:20,322 --> 00:31:25,686
I think it's one that will continue into future
seasons. In a way, it's kind of bittersweet

339
00:31:25,746 --> 00:31:31,069
that Nina died still innocent, still having
never killed someone and becoming the same

340
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:35,773
kind of monster that the others were. I was
angry when she died. I was pissed because I

341
00:31:35,813 --> 00:31:41,383
liked her as a character. And I was wondering
like why they even included her on a team of

342
00:31:41,423 --> 00:31:45,584
killers to begin with if they probably knew
by her psychological profile that she was not

343
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:50,685
a killer. Yeah, her role on the team was not
incredibly practical, you know, up until the

344
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:55,607
end when she was tasked with killing the princess
in the water. But for majority of the season,

345
00:31:55,647 --> 00:32:00,528
Nina simply just wanted a friend, whether that
was GIA Robot or the bride. I think she was

346
00:32:00,548 --> 00:32:05,689
kind of there for moral support and to bring
some small degree of optimism to the team.

347
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:12,073
Moving on to GI Robot, he was voiced by Sean
Gunn, who is James Gunn's brother, and who

348
00:32:12,093 --> 00:32:16,897
is a much better actor than I think people give
him credit for, particularly when it comes

349
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:21,780
to physicality. Now, of course, in an animated
series, you don't really get to see that, but

350
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:27,464
even vocally, the fact that he voiced multiple
characters on the show and it wasn't terribly

351
00:32:27,564 --> 00:32:33,408
easy to hear that just lets us see his range
as an actor. Oh yeah, you compare his Kraglin

352
00:32:33,428 --> 00:32:38,920
voice to his GI Robot voice. It's night and
day. I thought he was a fantastic GI robot.

353
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:45,005
And even his weasel noises, that was like pretty
good. Now, GI robot comes across as the most

354
00:32:45,285 --> 00:32:51,209
one note character of the team. He simply wants
to kill Nazis. But beneath that was also a

355
00:32:51,249 --> 00:32:58,135
yearning for camaraderie. He wanted to kill
Nazis, but as part of a team. Literally nothing

356
00:32:58,295 --> 00:33:02,878
brought him more joy. And it was kind of sad
to see him destroyed. as he's finally getting

357
00:33:03,098 --> 00:33:07,401
to live out his life's purpose after all these
years. But it was also cool to see him at the

358
00:33:07,461 --> 00:33:11,903
end with his upgrades. Yeah, in the books he's
called Jake, if I remember correctly, and he

359
00:33:11,964 --> 00:33:15,706
does get upgrades in the comics. I don't know
if he quite looks like the tank that he is

360
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:19,948
at the end of the show though. No, no, he doesn't.
But yeah, there were actually two different

361
00:33:19,968 --> 00:33:25,171
versions of Jake. I'm guessing this is the number
two version because he wore a number two on

362
00:33:25,231 --> 00:33:30,802
his helmet. He cracked me up though. I really
love the scene where He's standing guard, you

363
00:33:30,822 --> 00:33:34,084
know, watching over the princess outside of
her door. And all he can talk about is just

364
00:33:34,104 --> 00:33:38,987
like, I killed 33 Nazis. And he just keeps going
on and on about that stuff. But like the look

365
00:33:39,027 --> 00:33:43,529
on his face, it almost looks like he's always
smiling. Right. Yeah. So there's just something

366
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:48,412
really endearing and quirky about the character
that I just loved. Yeah, he was great. Now,

367
00:33:48,452 --> 00:33:53,254
of course, Sean Gunn's other performance was
as Weasel, a role he played in the Suicide

368
00:33:53,274 --> 00:33:58,257
Squad film. I was really glad to learn that
Weasel was not responsible for killing a whole

369
00:33:58,277 --> 00:34:03,188
bunch of children. as we learned in that movie.
It turns out he didn't kill the kids, he simply

370
00:34:03,248 --> 00:34:08,832
tried to save them from a fire, but was mistaken
as a monster attacking them. All the Weasel

371
00:34:08,872 --> 00:34:14,676
wants is to play, and he's instinctually very
loyal to anyone who's kind enough to bond with

372
00:34:14,716 --> 00:34:21,561
him over a game of fetch, including the Princess.
It's fairly tragic that because he's not intelligent

373
00:34:21,621 --> 00:34:28,005
enough to follow orders, if he hadn't intervened
the Princess's assassination, Nina Mazursky

374
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:32,460
would have lived. Yeah, that is tragic. But
by the end of the series, weasel became my

375
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,244
favorite character. Like I didn't really care
for weasel in the suicide squad movie. But

376
00:34:37,324 --> 00:34:41,568
here, you know, he just kind of reminds me of
my dog. You know, he just totally constantly

377
00:34:41,688 --> 00:34:45,731
always wanting to play. Even when like you thought
he was going to throw down with a pack of wolves

378
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:49,594
and he picks up the stick and plays fetch and
just spends the whole night playing with them.

379
00:34:50,135 --> 00:34:54,258
And then like his sole motivation to go to the
castle was to play with the princess again,

380
00:34:54,438 --> 00:34:59,330
because she played fetch with him. It was just
so endearing, so endearing. Yeah, absolutely.

381
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:04,292
And still, even though he was responsible for
Nina's death, the character is still extremely

382
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:10,315
innocent and endearing because of that. Moving
on to Dr. Phosphorus, he was voiced by Alan

383
00:35:10,355 --> 00:35:17,738
Tudyk, who is an absolute master of the craft
of acting, both on screen and in his voiceover

384
00:35:17,778 --> 00:35:24,861
work. He's done a ton of voice roles for Disney,
but he's also done quite a bit for DC, such

385
00:35:24,921 --> 00:35:28,974
as being Mr. Nobody. in the Doom Patrol and
he was fantastic in that role and I'm glad

386
00:35:28,994 --> 00:35:34,156
he's sticking around in the new DCU. Well, he's
also in Harley Quinn. That's right, yeah, he

387
00:35:34,176 --> 00:35:39,517
voices Clayface and the Joker in that show.
Now before he was Dr. Phosphorus, the character

388
00:35:39,557 --> 00:35:45,739
was Dr. Alex Sartorius, whose family was killed
by the Gotham City mobster Rupert Thorne after

389
00:35:45,799 --> 00:35:52,220
Dr. Sartorius forged data on a cancer-curing
experiment that Thorne had funded. After being

390
00:35:52,261 --> 00:35:57,614
transformed into a radioactive skeleton and
avenging his family, Dr. Sartorius, now known

391
00:35:57,714 --> 00:36:03,478
as Dr. Phosphorus, slid deeper and deeper into
the pit of villainy and power until he was

392
00:36:03,538 --> 00:36:08,821
captured by Batman. He's the rebel of the group,
and with his skeletal appearance, it was hard

393
00:36:08,841 --> 00:36:13,903
to see him as anything other than a violent
monster until you learn his backstory and realize

394
00:36:13,944 --> 00:36:19,887
he, like any other man would, misses his family.
The scene of him talking with the little girl,

395
00:36:20,207 --> 00:36:25,126
saying he can't have her telling others that
she saw him, was kind of frightening. only

396
00:36:25,146 --> 00:36:29,788
for him to then be playing with her outside
in the next scene, which was definitely a subversion

397
00:36:29,828 --> 00:36:35,950
of expectations. I think the most shocking scene
of the whole show was seeing him as a scientist

398
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:41,752
being laughed at while being forced to run his
fingerprints over the bodies of his dead wife

399
00:36:41,792 --> 00:36:48,675
and child. Oh, man, I've never seen anything
like that before. It was unbelievably heartbreaking

400
00:36:48,855 --> 00:36:52,757
for sure. It's disturbing. And I think that
like disturbance kind of sticks with you for

401
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:57,727
that whole episode. which makes Dr. Phosphorus'
interaction with the little girl so full of

402
00:36:57,787 --> 00:37:01,268
tension, you know. But it was a nice moment
because it showed that he just really wanted

403
00:37:01,288 --> 00:37:05,930
to be a father again. Right, exactly. Moving
on to the final character in the character

404
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:11,573
breakdown, Princess Ilana Rustovic. She was
voiced by Maria Bakalova, who played Borat's

405
00:37:11,593 --> 00:37:17,475
daughter in Borat 2, and voiced Cosmo the Space
Dog in Guardians of the Galaxy 3. She did a

406
00:37:17,515 --> 00:37:22,477
fantastic job with this role. You know, the
Princess begins the series as this manipulative

407
00:37:22,577 --> 00:37:28,071
minx. who we later learn could potentially lead
the destruction of the world. The overarching

408
00:37:28,191 --> 00:37:33,892
mystery of the show is whether or not this woman
is trustworthy. She's the primary antagonist

409
00:37:34,092 --> 00:37:39,154
of the series, though we don't realize she's
an actual villain until the final minutes of

410
00:37:39,194 --> 00:37:43,615
the season's final episode, where we learn,
in the Brideswords, that the Princess was a

411
00:37:43,655 --> 00:37:49,137
power-mad, sadistic, narcissistic Disney princess
who wants to destroy the world. And that changes

412
00:37:49,557 --> 00:37:55,022
a lot of how you see the character in retrospect.
and that we knew she was manipulative since

413
00:37:55,062 --> 00:38:00,264
the beginning, but we didn't realize how malevolent
those manipulations were and for what sick

414
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:05,786
purpose. Yeah, I guess the stakes were that
she was in possession of some kind of devastating

415
00:38:06,106 --> 00:38:11,067
armor weapon that would be used to kill all
the heroes in the world. Was she supposed to

416
00:38:11,087 --> 00:38:16,389
be some kind of analog to the Amethyst character
from DC Comics? I wonder, because her knights

417
00:38:16,409 --> 00:38:21,502
were called Amethyst Knights. I was wondering
that. I'm not entirely sure because the princess

418
00:38:21,542 --> 00:38:26,284
is an original character, but given the way
everything looked and the way she looked also,

419
00:38:26,825 --> 00:38:31,346
I would not be surprised if that was the case.
That said, they probably did not want to go

420
00:38:31,366 --> 00:38:36,348
with Amethyst because Amethyst is a teenage
hero in the comics. I do wish they would have

421
00:38:36,368 --> 00:38:42,411
given a little bit more clarity into her true
nature, like at least shown us this suit of

422
00:38:42,471 --> 00:38:47,393
armor in storage or something like that. Or
at least explain why she wants to take over

423
00:38:47,413 --> 00:38:52,292
the world. Is it because... She just wants to
rule everything because I don't love that as

424
00:38:52,312 --> 00:38:57,917
a motivation. Yeah, it's a pretty weak and vague
motivation as things go. And I guess that would

425
00:38:57,957 --> 00:39:03,281
be the biggest downfall of the season as a whole.
I agree. It kind of had a villain problem in

426
00:39:03,321 --> 00:39:07,184
that she's the antagonist. She's the person
they're going up against, but we don't know

427
00:39:07,405 --> 00:39:12,109
really anything about the villain, like their
motivation, which tends to signal a weak project.

428
00:39:12,509 --> 00:39:18,746
That said, I think the main focus of this series
was the creature commandos and not her. Yeah,

429
00:39:18,786 --> 00:39:22,727
the whole show was more character driven than
plot driven. I actually found myself a little

430
00:39:22,787 --> 00:39:28,370
impatient with the show after the first three
episodes because plot wise, there's not a whole

431
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:33,472
lot there. They basically go to Polokistan and
defeat Cersei, and it's hard to tell where

432
00:39:33,512 --> 00:39:38,634
this story is going until episode four. But
basically, through the first three episodes,

433
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:44,017
the interesting stuff comes from the character
explorations. Absolutely. Yeah, if you strip

434
00:39:44,117 --> 00:39:49,613
all of the flashbacks in this series. The story
is very, very simple and actually not that

435
00:39:49,633 --> 00:39:54,986
great. It's the flashbacks that make this series.
But speaking of the series, let's move on to

436
00:39:55,027 --> 00:39:56,029
our story highlights.

437
00:40:03,182 --> 00:40:08,846

where we settle the debate and settle the score.

444
00:40:50,503 --> 00:40:55,648
Episode 1 was titled The Collie Wobbles. When
the nation of Pakolistan goes under attack

445
00:40:55,668 --> 00:41:01,013
by the sorceress Cersei and her army, the Sons
of Themyscira, Amanda Waller assembles a team

446
00:41:01,073 --> 00:41:07,619
of non-human prison inmates known as Task Force
M, or the Creature Commandos, to protect the

447
00:41:07,659 --> 00:41:13,905
nation's Princess Ilana Rostovic, who has promised
petroleum deposits in her country to the US.

448
00:41:14,502 --> 00:41:19,764
Led by Rick Flag, the team arrives in Pakolistan
and meets with Princess Ilana Rostovic, who

449
00:41:19,804 --> 00:41:25,666
manages to charm Rick Flag into a sexual relationship.
While Dr. Phosphorus attempts to steal Flag's

450
00:41:25,726 --> 00:41:32,649
remote that triggers a painful shock in the
team in order to keep them in line, resulting

451
00:41:32,689 --> 00:41:37,611
in a skirmish between the two, the bride and
Nina sneak off to Frankenstein's castle, where

452
00:41:37,631 --> 00:41:38,892
the bride was created.

453
00:41:43,594 --> 00:41:49,517
watching the castle that the bride has returned.
I actually like how this series follows Peacemaker

454
00:41:49,557 --> 00:41:55,140
season one, at the end of which Amanda Waller's
Task Force X is outed to the public and to

455
00:41:55,160 --> 00:42:01,324
the government. And so they strip her of her
ability to form government teams using human

456
00:42:01,404 --> 00:42:08,128
inmates. So then she resorts to using non-human
inmates or monsters for her missions. Yeah,

457
00:42:08,148 --> 00:42:12,090
it's a pretty good loophole and very in keeping
with the character of Amanda Waller. Episode

458
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:18,214
2 was titled The Tourmaline Necklace. In flashbacks,
we learn about the tragic origins of the bride,

459
00:42:18,514 --> 00:42:24,398
reluctantly created by Dr. Victor Frankenstein
from the bodies of cadavers as a mate for Erik.

460
00:42:24,838 --> 00:42:30,521
Her education from Victor leads to a romantic
attraction culminating in Victor's death at

461
00:42:30,541 --> 00:42:35,665
the hands of the jealous Erik Frankenstein,
who continues to pursue the bride across time

462
00:42:36,145 --> 00:42:41,140
and the planet. In the present, the bride and
Nina locate a necklace that Victor once gave

463
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:46,563
to the bride before the two are ambushed by
Cersei, whose sons of Themyscira noticed the

464
00:42:46,603 --> 00:42:51,926
bride and Nina entering the castle, resulting
in a brutal fight that leaves the bride and

465
00:42:52,026 --> 00:42:57,309
Nina defeated. This episode really makes you
feel for the bride, who again came off as pretty

466
00:42:57,389 --> 00:43:03,233
sand-offish in the first episode, but here you
learn why that's the case, and it's a really

467
00:43:03,313 --> 00:43:06,738
interesting backstory. Yeah, it was hard to
know where the story was going. The fact that

468
00:43:06,758 --> 00:43:11,701
she went after a necklace really served to speak
to her sentimental nature, I think, and that

469
00:43:11,741 --> 00:43:17,724
she truly loved Dr. Victor Frankenstein. And
I'm wondering if she'll love anybody else the

470
00:43:17,764 --> 00:43:22,586
way she loved him. And it was almost like she
lost the love of her life. Got to say, though,

471
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:29,389
it's pretty gross for Victor Frankenstein to
bone this reanimated cadaver chick. Necrophilia?

472
00:43:29,954 --> 00:43:34,576
Yeah, yeah, very gross. It's a little weird.
Yeah. Episode three was titled Cheers to the

473
00:43:34,616 --> 00:43:40,279
Tin Man. In flashbacks to G.I. Robot's history
is explored from his time as an effective soldier

474
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:45,882
for the U.S. military during World War Two to
when he was reawakened by a military arms collector

475
00:43:46,262 --> 00:43:51,605
after decades of being decommissioned. After
killing a group of neo-Nazis, G.I. Robot was

476
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:56,968
imprisoned and later drafted into Task Force
M. When the team arrives at Victor's castle

477
00:43:56,988 --> 00:44:02,424
to rescue Nina and the bride, They realized
the two were kept alive to distract them from

478
00:44:02,524 --> 00:44:08,910
Cersei's forces attacking Castle Rostovic and
the Princess. Flag and the team return to Rostovic's

479
00:44:08,930 --> 00:44:14,694
castle, now under siege, and during a chaotic
battle, G.I. Robot is destroyed after saving

480
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:20,359
the team. Cersei is eventually defeated, but
not before she exclaims that Task Force M has

481
00:44:20,439 --> 00:44:26,004
doomed the world. I really liked G.I. Robot's
backstory, everything from World War II to

482
00:44:26,344 --> 00:44:31,119
seeing Dr. William Magnus converse with the
character and give him upgrades and stuff like

483
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:35,541
that. The upgrade of him like being able to
detach his torso from his legs and just like

484
00:44:35,601 --> 00:44:40,243
levitate so he could spin around that way was
pretty cool, even though it didn't really last

485
00:44:40,283 --> 00:44:46,165
very long. What did you think of the characterization
of Dr. William Magnus? Because at some points

486
00:44:46,205 --> 00:44:50,427
it seemed a little bit sinister. I wasn't sure
how I felt about that. I didn't mind that.

487
00:44:50,567 --> 00:44:55,589
I know there's been some flirtation with Dr.
William Magnus being a villain in the comics.

488
00:44:55,970 --> 00:45:00,711
So I think it was in keeping with that. I'm
sure they'll do further exploration with the

489
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:05,832
character. Because I think he was planted in
here to establish further DC Studio projects,

490
00:45:05,972 --> 00:45:09,873
like the Metal Men, eventually at some point.
Because I don't really see any other reason

491
00:45:09,893 --> 00:45:14,355
why he was included here. He, of course, was
voiced by Alan Tudyk. So maybe we'll actually

492
00:45:14,375 --> 00:45:19,376
get to see Alan Tudyk play that role in live
action. I was actually shocked when G.I. Robot

493
00:45:19,496 --> 00:45:24,357
died because he was so endearing as a character
that you expected him to last throughout the

494
00:45:24,377 --> 00:45:28,751
entire series. I'm really glad that they brought
him back, but I do have to commend the show

495
00:45:28,871 --> 00:45:32,612
for delivering on the stakes that they set up.
Yeah, I didn't think he was going to die either.

496
00:45:32,793 --> 00:45:38,715
It was when he did that I realized, oh shit,
like, is no one safe? Is this like the Suicide

497
00:45:38,755 --> 00:45:43,357
Squad? I hadn't really made that connection
earlier for some reason that, hey, these characters

498
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:49,480
can actually die in this adventure. Episode
4 was titled Chasing Squirrels. In flashbacks,

499
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:54,990
Weasel befriends a group of schoolchildren only
to be confused for their attacker. When a fire

500
00:45:55,030 --> 00:46:00,253
breaks out, authorities prioritize apprehending
Gweasel over rescuing the children. In the

501
00:46:00,293 --> 00:46:05,957
present, the team returns to Belle Reve where
Cersei is interrogated and shows Waller a vision

502
00:46:06,277 --> 00:46:11,861
of an apocalyptic future caused by Princess
Rostakov's rise to power. Though Flag insists

503
00:46:11,941 --> 00:46:17,184
on the princess's innocence after the assurance
from leading Amazonian researcher Dr. Isla

504
00:46:17,224 --> 00:46:23,191
MacPherson on Cersei's credibility, Waller assigns
the bride to lead the team in Flagg's place

505
00:46:23,491 --> 00:46:29,655
on a mission to assassinate the princess. While
the team heads back to Pakolistan, Erik Frankenstein

506
00:46:29,815 --> 00:46:34,598
ambushes Flagg at his home with the assumption
that he and the bride were in a relationship.

507
00:46:34,938 --> 00:46:40,381
Clearing up the misunderstanding, Erik and Flagg
agree to join forces to stop the princess's

508
00:46:40,481 --> 00:46:45,404
assassination. It was at this point in the series
when you really begin to understand the deranged

509
00:46:45,524 --> 00:46:50,738
nature of Erik's obsession with the bride. Yeah,
it was really unsettling, especially in the

510
00:46:50,758 --> 00:46:55,080
next episode when you get into his backstory.
But yeah, I didn't like the character Frankenstein

511
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:59,502
at all here. This is one of the better episodes
for me and just that the story was probably

512
00:46:59,542 --> 00:47:04,144
the most tragic with Weasel and the group of
children. I just want to know where those kids

513
00:47:04,184 --> 00:47:10,306
parents were and why the school building was
left unlocked. Yeah, where was like the teacher

514
00:47:10,347 --> 00:47:15,949
supervisor? I assume that the kids were playing
at the school's playground after hours or like

515
00:47:15,989 --> 00:47:20,647
on a weekend or something like that. Which is
why the school was empty during the time that

516
00:47:20,667 --> 00:47:25,090
the explosion occurred. That makes sense. Yeah.
But I wanted to be like, don't play with fire,

517
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:29,493
kids. Like, what are you doing? Don't don't
do that. That's like lesson number one. They're

518
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:33,315
like a parent teaches their kids don't play
with fire, don't play with dangerous things.

519
00:47:33,796 --> 00:47:37,798
But I really got pissed at the police officers
when weasel was trying to rescue the little

520
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:43,242
girl. And they prioritized shooting him over
rescuing the little girl, you know. Dude, how

521
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:47,643
did one of those bullets not hit the little
girl? That's all I was thinking about as that

522
00:47:47,683 --> 00:47:52,826
scene was happening. Yeah, in the end, though,
it didn't matter, which was truly sad. Heartbreaking,

523
00:47:52,946 --> 00:47:58,728
heartbreaking. Moving on to episode five titled
The Iron Pot. In flashbacks, Eric Frankenstein

524
00:47:59,048 --> 00:48:05,071
is found by a blind medicine woman named Bogdana
after the bride's initial attack and rejection.

525
00:48:05,531 --> 00:48:11,133
After being nourished back to health, rather
than leave Bogdana alone, Eric kills her. In

526
00:48:11,153 --> 00:48:16,657
the present, Flagg and Eric spy on Dr. MacPherson,
learning that she has been killed and replaced

527
00:48:16,697 --> 00:48:21,980
by Clayface. Flagg manages to warn the princess
over the phone that Task Force M is coming

528
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:27,884
to kill her before he and Eric are attacked
by Clayface. Clayface critically injures Flagg

529
00:48:27,924 --> 00:48:34,108
before Eric manages to electrocute him. Meanwhile,
Task Force M is ambushed and separated by the

530
00:48:34,189 --> 00:48:37,511
Picolestani army shortly after they arrive in
the country.

531
00:48:41,614 --> 00:48:46,636
Clayface that we've gotten over the past year,
including Creature Commandos, Harley Quinn,

532
00:48:46,796 --> 00:48:51,979
Suicide Squad, Isekai, and Batman Caped Crusader,
how would you rank those four? Well, I think

533
00:48:52,059 --> 00:48:56,622
the Caped Crusader version was the most interesting,
but in terms of just faithfulness to the comics,

534
00:48:57,002 --> 00:49:01,304
I would actually say it's this Creature Commandos
version. Yeah, now that the other two aren't

535
00:49:01,344 --> 00:49:05,566
without their merit, but they were definitely
looser adaptations of the character of Clayface,

536
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:09,529
I also really liked this Creature Commandos
version because he seemed more dangerous than

537
00:49:09,549 --> 00:49:14,763
the others. Absolutely. Honestly, I'm kind of
hoping that he appears in season two as a member

538
00:49:14,803 --> 00:49:20,006
of the team. I thought he worked really well
in Suicide Squad Isakai as a part of the Suicide

539
00:49:20,026 --> 00:49:24,669
Squad. Except you can't really put a bomb in
his neck or like a taser, you know, as that

540
00:49:24,709 --> 00:49:31,833
show proved. Magic. Just use magic. I still
can't get around why Frankenstein killed the

541
00:49:31,893 --> 00:49:37,035
old woman healer. I guess I don't quite get
what happened there. I guess in some sick,

542
00:49:37,195 --> 00:49:43,775
twisted rationale, he figured he was doing her
a favor. by having her not feel loneliness

543
00:49:43,835 --> 00:49:48,659
and rejection, but I thought it was unbelievably
cruel. Yeah, at that point there was no real

544
00:49:48,759 --> 00:49:53,162
redeeming the character of Frankenstein, because
before that you knew that he was an asshole.

545
00:49:53,642 --> 00:49:58,045
Right, but it wasn't until that moment that
you saw he truly was a monster. Right. Moving

546
00:49:58,105 --> 00:50:03,489
on to episode six, which was titled, Pre-Atel
Skelette. In flashbacks, we learned that Dr.

547
00:50:03,529 --> 00:50:09,773
Phosphorus was a mad scientist named Alex Sartorius,
who borrowed money from the mob to fund experiments.

548
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:14,911
on a machine that could cure cancer. When the
mob kills his family and attempts to kill him

549
00:50:15,071 --> 00:50:21,032
in the machine, Alex is reborn as the radioactive
Dr. Phosphorus, who kills the mobsters and

550
00:50:21,072 --> 00:50:26,354
fills the vacuum as a mob leader in the Gotham
City underworld before being imprisoned by

551
00:50:26,434 --> 00:50:31,975
Batman. In the present, while on the run from
the Pakolestani army, Phosphorus encounters

552
00:50:32,035 --> 00:50:37,137
a child who reminds him of his lost son, while
the bride and Nina protect a local brothel

553
00:50:37,557 --> 00:50:42,419
and Weasel bonds with a wolf pack. Each of the
team members reunite on their way to Castle

554
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:47,764
Rustovic to assassinate the Princess. This is
a fantastic episode, really tragic opening,

555
00:50:47,964 --> 00:50:53,609
but I like the way it set up the climax of the
show toward the end. The dance number with

556
00:50:53,649 --> 00:50:58,974
Dr. Phosphorus was a little bit weird. Actually,
you know, there were quite a few musical numbers

557
00:50:58,994 --> 00:51:04,038
throughout the course of this series that kind
of stood out to me in a distracting way, in

558
00:51:04,058 --> 00:51:08,702
a way that I don't think was entirely necessary.
Like, James Gunn likes to use a lot of pop

559
00:51:08,722 --> 00:51:14,046
music in his projects. But in this show, some
of them almost seemed to just pad the runtime.

560
00:51:14,426 --> 00:51:19,529
Watching Dr. Phosphorus dance in his pimp outfit
is one of those cases. There was also another

561
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:24,793
instance, I think in episode two, where we actually
saw the band, Gogo Bordello, perform their

562
00:51:24,833 --> 00:51:30,137
song, Start Wearing Purple. It was just weird,
it was weird, like a music video. I actually

563
00:51:30,317 --> 00:51:35,661
loved that. I loved all of the musical choices
and numbers in this series from Start Wearing

564
00:51:35,701 --> 00:51:41,672
Purple. to seeing Dr. Phosphorus dancing. He
was just so drunk on power that he could like

565
00:51:41,712 --> 00:51:46,675
get away with stuff like that. Like I mentioned,
I think the soundtrack for this series would

566
00:51:46,695 --> 00:51:51,478
make Quentin Tarantino proud. For sure. But
like Dr. Phosphorus had a whole choreographed

567
00:51:51,538 --> 00:51:55,180
number with backup dancers and everything like
that. You didn't find that distracting? No,

568
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:01,483
I was laughing. Okay. All right. It was funny
that it got interrupted by Batman. Yeah, Batman

569
00:52:01,503 --> 00:52:05,065
wasn't having any of it. He was like, really
a dance number? Not having any of this shit.

570
00:52:06,306 --> 00:52:12,087
The final episode of the series, episode seven,
was titled A Very Funny Monster. In flashbacks,

571
00:52:12,127 --> 00:52:17,109
we learned that Nina was born with deformed
lungs, resulting in her father, the renowned

572
00:52:17,209 --> 00:52:22,690
geneticist and engineer Edward Mazursky, to
create a mobile iron lung for his daughter.

573
00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:27,932
When Nina's mother leaves her family, Edward
experiments on his daughter, turning her into

574
00:52:27,972 --> 00:52:33,593
an aquatic hybrid capable of breathing water.
After being teased in school, Nina ran away

575
00:52:33,613 --> 00:52:39,245
from home. living in sewers as an urban legend
until she was caught by authorities, resulting

576
00:52:39,305 --> 00:52:45,109
in her father being shot while trying to rescue
her. In the present, Task Force M makes their

577
00:52:45,129 --> 00:52:49,752
way into the castle's security tower where they
find footage of Clayface with the princess

578
00:52:50,172 --> 00:52:55,916
and where Eric finally catches up with them.
Unwilling to hear anything from Eric, the bride

579
00:52:55,996 --> 00:53:00,619
dispatches him quickly before the team makes
their way to a lake where the princess is swimming.

580
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:06,059
Nina is tasked with executing the assassination.
but fails and is killed by the princess when

581
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:11,664
Weasel, who was fond of the princess, alerts
her to the danger. After receiving a call from

582
00:53:11,704 --> 00:53:16,587
Amanda Waller calling off the assassination,
the bride kills the princess nonetheless for

583
00:53:16,607 --> 00:53:22,172
killing Nina, and after piecing together that
Cersei was right after all. A new task force

584
00:53:22,312 --> 00:53:27,756
am is formed in the aftermath, featuring a mix
of survivors and new recruits, with the bride

585
00:53:27,796 --> 00:53:33,148
placed in charge once again. And that's the
series. I really liked this episode. Nina Mazurski's

586
00:53:33,188 --> 00:53:38,071
backstory was just as tragic as the rest of
them. But I think I felt a stronger connection

587
00:53:38,111 --> 00:53:43,415
to this one because as a father, I have a daughter,
I have two daughters and there's nothing I

588
00:53:43,435 --> 00:53:48,119
wouldn't do for them. Yeah. Seeing Professor
Mazurski's love for his daughter really made

589
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:53,563
you have disdain for the mother and how she
just didn't love the child. You know, it was

590
00:53:53,603 --> 00:53:58,294
really heartbreaking when the father died in
front of Nina as she was being arrested. Oh

591
00:53:58,334 --> 00:54:03,297
yeah, totally. Right in the feels. I do wonder
about the practicality of genetically transforming

592
00:54:03,337 --> 00:54:07,300
your daughter into a gill creature though, especially
when she's having a hard enough time breathing

593
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:13,084
anyway, to confine her to only breathing underwater.
It was a little bit of a strange solution.

594
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:17,827
I think he should have kept working on it. Well,
I got the impression that the experiment went

595
00:54:17,927 --> 00:54:22,611
somewhat wrong, or that he wasn't fully aware
of what it would do. He was only trying to

596
00:54:22,631 --> 00:54:27,982
find a way for her to breathe with the liquid
that was constantly in her lungs. And I'm not

597
00:54:28,102 --> 00:54:33,264
sure the result was what he intended. Because
if you think about it, it wasn't that much

598
00:54:33,324 --> 00:54:38,946
better wearing a fishbowl on your head than
it was walking around with an iron lung. Right,

599
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:43,648
exactly. Again, the final moments of the series
were among my favorites when the bride just

600
00:54:43,768 --> 00:54:48,631
straight up kills the princess for no other
reason than killing her friend Nina. I'm really

601
00:54:48,651 --> 00:54:52,852
glad that they have announced a season two for
the series because whether we see them in live

602
00:54:52,912 --> 00:54:58,531
action or not, I can't wait to see more. from
these characters, particularly the Bride, I

603
00:54:58,551 --> 00:55:03,615
think you could do a lot with this series and
with a lot of DC's characters, like Clayface,

604
00:55:03,995 --> 00:55:09,379
like a number of villains within DC. For sure,
yeah, the dialogue was well written. I think

605
00:55:09,399 --> 00:55:15,082
when you look at the quality of shows like Creature
Commando Season 1, like Peacemaker Season 1,

606
00:55:15,523 --> 00:55:20,526
and like the Suicide Squad, you can't help but
be excited for the future of the DCU in James

607
00:55:20,546 --> 00:55:22,127
Gunn's hands as a DC fan.

608
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:31,153
I'm really hoping this isn't the same tone that
we'll see in a project like Superman or other

609
00:55:31,253 --> 00:55:38,418
DC fare, Supergirl, even the Lantern series.
But for this, James Gunn's style and tone is

610
00:55:38,598 --> 00:55:44,042
absolutely perfect. Now it's not a perfect show,
as we mentioned there are problems with the

611
00:55:44,082 --> 00:55:49,726
villain, but for the most part, despite its
mature and violent nature, DC Studios' initial

612
00:55:49,766 --> 00:55:56,650
foray packs fun action spectacle and dire stakes
while conveying that behind every monster,

613
00:55:56,830 --> 00:56:03,574
as I mentioned earlier, is a tragedy. I'm giving
this show 4 out of 5 stars, a fresh rating

614
00:56:03,714 --> 00:56:08,437
on Rotten Tomatoes. Yeah, I would agree with
4 out of 5 stars. That was the rating that

615
00:56:08,477 --> 00:56:13,440
I gave the first season of Hitmonkey, which
I really enjoyed. I think there's a lot of

616
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:18,823
commonalities between Hitmonkey and Creature
Commandos. Yeah, I love Hitmonkey for Marvel,

617
00:56:18,863 --> 00:56:24,778
and I'm really glad that DC has basically an
equivalent to that. in our universe. I liked

618
00:56:24,838 --> 00:56:29,139
season two of Hit Monkey a little bit more than
season one, which I think had probably too

619
00:56:29,159 --> 00:56:33,921
many episodes. But for Creature Commandos, they
had just the right amount of episodes to tell

620
00:56:33,961 --> 00:56:38,682
the story they wanted to tell, which again was
pretty simple, maybe too simple, but I still

621
00:56:38,722 --> 00:56:43,444
really liked it. For sure. Hopefully we hear
words soon as to when season two begins production

622
00:56:43,504 --> 00:56:47,605
so we can know around the time that it's going
to come out. But that does it for this review.

is going to be a tie-in to Creature Commando

629
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:29,410
Season 1 as we find out who would win in a fight
between Cersei, the Wonder Woman sorceress

630
00:57:29,450 --> 00:57:35,674
villain, versus Morgan Lafay, the Avengers villain.
Actually she started out as a Black Knight

631
00:57:35,754 --> 00:57:39,936
villain since his lore is steeped in Arthurian
legend. But it's going to be a good episode.

632
00:57:40,376 --> 00:57:44,819
Yeah, not only are these comic book characters,
but they're also characters from myth. It's

633
00:57:44,839 --> 00:57:48,161
going to be awesome. But that does it for this
episode. We want to give a big thanks to our
