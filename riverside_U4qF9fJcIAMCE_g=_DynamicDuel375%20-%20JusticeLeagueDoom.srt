00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,957
This is a DynaMic Network podcast.

2
00:00:24,622 --> 00:00:29,563
This is the Dynamic Duel Podcast, a weekly show
where we review superhero films and debate

3
00:00:29,603 --> 00:00:35,345
the superiority between Marvel and DC by comparing
their characters in stat-based battle simulations.

4
00:00:35,725 --> 00:00:42,287
I'm Johnny DC. And I'm his twin brother, Marvelous
Joe. And in this episode, as a tie-in to our

5
00:00:42,387 --> 00:00:47,168
last episode, which was a team duel between
the Legion of Doom and the Masters of Evil,

6
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:56,103
we are doing a review of the DC animated film
which features the Legion of Doom as the main

7
00:00:56,383 --> 00:01:01,305
villainous cast. Yeah, it is a solid movie.
It was my first time seeing it the other day.

8
00:01:01,545 --> 00:01:05,407
And yeah, we'll talk more about it later on
this episode. Before that, we're going to break

9
00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:09,669
down the comic book news from the past week,
of which we got some doozies. We learned that

10
00:01:09,709 --> 00:01:16,392
the Batman 2 release date has been pushed back
from 2025 a year to 2026. The Venom sequel

11
00:01:16,412 --> 00:01:22,349
title and new release date has been announced
and. DC Studios is working on a live action

12
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,276
Teen Titans film. As always, we list our segment
times in our episode description, so feel free

and thanks to everyone who supports the podcast,
including Dustin Belkum, whose birthday was

29
00:02:52,202 --> 00:02:58,166
this past week. Happy birthday, if I could get
you one gift from Marvel. Have I given away

30
00:02:58,247 --> 00:03:03,570
Thor's hammer yet, Mjolnir? I'm sure you have.
Well, I'm giving it away again, because whoever

31
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,734
I gave it to before is no longer worthy, so
we'll see if Dustin's worthy to wield it. I'm

32
00:03:07,774 --> 00:03:12,537
sure he is, because he likes Marvel. No DC fan
can lift that shit. And from DC, I'm gonna

33
00:03:12,557 --> 00:03:17,864
get you... The Batmobile, specifically the one
from The Batman. Cause you know you like that

34
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:25,510
shit, Dustin. You know you like it. No, it was
boring. Time will prove you guys wrong. Guys,

35
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,353
be sure to tune into the Dynamic Podcast Network
this week, which includes Max Destruction,

36
00:03:30,493 --> 00:03:33,695
a show that pits your favorite action heroes
from film and television against each other.

37
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:39,479
This week, they're gonna find out who's gonna
win between Haru from Beverly Hills Ninja and

38
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:44,538
Sho Nuff from The Last Dragon. That's gonna
be a great episode. I loved those movies as

39
00:03:44,578 --> 00:03:50,141
a kid. Looking forward to that episode. On the
Sanjo World podcast, host Zachary Hepburn speculates

40
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:55,244
on fights between fan favorite anime characters.
This Thursday, we'll find out who would win

41
00:03:55,384 --> 00:04:01,988
between Hisoka Marou from Hunter and Joker from
Fire Force. I bet you nailed those pronunciations

42
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:07,491
again. Marou? Maroo? Something like that. On
the Console Combat podcast, host John and Dean

43
00:04:07,531 --> 00:04:11,893
find out who would win in fights between popular
video game characters. In yesterday's episode...

44
00:04:12,226 --> 00:04:18,728
They found out who'd win between Michael DeSanta

out of the way, quick to the No Prize! A No

47
00:04:30,993 --> 00:04:35,275
Prize is an award Marvel used to give out to
fans. Our version, the Dynamic Duel No Prize,

48
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:39,837
is a digital award we post on Instagram for
the person that we feel gave the best answer

49
00:04:39,877 --> 00:04:46,061
to our question of the week. Last week we asked,
what is your favorite DC or Marvel video game

50
00:04:46,342 --> 00:04:50,685
and why? We got quite a few answers so let's
go ahead and run down our honorable mentions

51
00:04:50,885 --> 00:04:57,431
as well as the no prize winner. Our first honorable
mention goes to Travis Bailey who said, Travis

52
00:04:57,451 --> 00:05:02,195
Bailey, so the first thing that popped into
my head, I'm a little older than y'all, you

53
00:05:02,215 --> 00:05:08,280
know, I'm pen and paper, you know, in case you
find a one at the mall years old, so I automatically

54
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:14,118
thought of X-Men the arcade game. And I've wasted
so much of my time, like probably years out

55
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:19,300
of my life with a pocket full of quarters. And
this is the quintessential co-op game. I mean,

56
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,561
it's the gold standard of that genre. Man, if
you wasted years of your life on that game

57
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:28,523
with just a pocket full of quarters, then you
are doing far better than the rest of us, my

58
00:05:28,563 --> 00:05:32,824
friend, because Jonathan and I used to play
that game all the time. We'd go to Boardwalk

59
00:05:32,924 --> 00:05:38,725
USA and play that game. I remember. And I was
dying all the time. Yeah, same. But also like.

60
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:43,228
If you're saying you wasted years of your life
playing the X-Men arcade game, I would say

61
00:05:43,288 --> 00:05:47,750
those are years well spent, my friend, because
that game is awesome. That game is really awesome.

62
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:52,313
Definitely one of the quintessential arcade
games from the early nineties up there with,

63
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:56,515
you know, Captain America and the Avengers,
the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game, the

64
00:05:56,555 --> 00:06:01,538
Simpsons arcade game. Like all of those had
pretty much a similar gameplay style and were

65
00:06:01,758 --> 00:06:05,540
ubiquitous at almost every arcade across the
nation. Yeah. Like the side scroller. Great

66
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:12,180
answer, Travis. Our next honorable mention goes
to. Leo Roth who said, Hey guys, uh, it's Leo

67
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:19,044
Roth, long time listener, first time recording,
but the best superhero video game by far is

68
00:06:19,104 --> 00:06:25,928
Spider-Man 2 on the GameCube. The swinging mechanics
are great, story is great, and I just love

69
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:32,151
it so much. It's really, really good. And that
new Spider-Man 2, that's not good. Just this

70
00:06:32,251 --> 00:06:39,707
one. Honorable mention, Ultimate Spider-Man
on the GameCube. It's like a- playing through

71
00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:44,810
a real life comic. Now, Leo Roth sounds a little
bit young to be playing a game so old, but

72
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:50,673
he is no less correct. Spider-Man 2, which was
an adaptation of the movie, Spider-Man 2, when

73
00:06:50,713 --> 00:06:57,057
it came out in 2004, for the GameCube was incredible.
It was a game that kind of pioneered the swinging

74
00:06:57,097 --> 00:07:01,700
mechanics that we know and love today. And I
played the shit out of that game nonstop while

75
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,806
listening to Dashboard Confessional and the
entire Spider-Man 2 soundtrack. Those were

76
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:11,209
great times. Leo also mentioned Ultimate Spider-Man
for the GameCube. And Leo, if you have a GameCube,

77
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:17,072
you also gotta check out Hulk Ultimate Destruction
because that is still one of the best Hulk

78
00:07:17,092 --> 00:07:22,175
games that ever came out. The GameCube was just
a great era. Oh yeah, there was a Batman Begins

79
00:07:22,215 --> 00:07:26,417
video game that came out on the GameCube. That
was the closest thing to like a good Batman

80
00:07:26,457 --> 00:07:31,380
game, like a Splinter Cell stealth type video
game that we had until, you know, the Arkham

81
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:36,682
games. Great answer, Leo. Our next honorable
mention goes to... Caleb Volk who said, Hey

82
00:07:36,702 --> 00:07:43,005
guys, Caleb Volk, long time listener, first
time answering. I think the 2018 Spider-Man

83
00:07:43,025 --> 00:07:49,068
game is the best game Marvel or DC's ever come
out with just because of the storyline with

84
00:07:49,108 --> 00:07:55,891
Doctor. And Caleb actually got cut off in his
answer, but his answer of 2018 Spider-Man is,

85
00:07:56,011 --> 00:08:00,853
you know, top notch. It is highly regarded as
one of the best, if not the best superhero

86
00:08:00,873 --> 00:08:06,251
video game of all time. really puts you in the
driver's seat of being the character of Spider-Man

87
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:11,974
with incredible cinematics, an incredible story,
incredible gameplay, great everything. Yeah,

88
00:08:12,114 --> 00:08:18,296
I would have argued that the Arkham games are
the best superhero video games until I heard

89
00:08:18,336 --> 00:08:24,019
from DC fans on our Discord server that no,
actually, Spider-Man is probably a little bit

90
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:28,560
better. So I guess I'll concede that. Yeah,
that's a great point. Actually, that brings

91
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:33,503
us to the winner of this week's No Prize. who
also gave a Marvel answer, meaning that we

92
00:08:33,523 --> 00:08:37,687
have no DC answers because all DC video games
suck. Looking at you, Suicide Squad killed

93
00:08:37,707 --> 00:08:44,472
the Justice League. Damn it! But the winner
is Ed Jones. Who said? What's up guys? This

94
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:50,777
is Ed Jones here with my favorite DC and Marvel
game and I have to give it to Marvel Ultimate

95
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:57,903
Alliance 2. Baby, it is one of the best RPGs
I've played. You can play it with three of

96
00:08:57,943 --> 00:09:03,387
your buddies and it goes through one of the
best Marvel storylines. The Civil War? Oh,

97
00:09:03,427 --> 00:09:09,232
come on! How can you beat that? You just make
your own team and you go through the world

98
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:14,596
destroying things. I absolutely love it. Yeah,
fantastic answer with Marvel Ultimate Alliance

99
00:09:14,616 --> 00:09:19,820
2. Actually, we had Travis Herndon call in with
the first Marvel Ultimate Alliance, but I think

100
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:24,985
the sequel kind of took everything great from
the original and kind of expanded on it, you

101
00:09:25,005 --> 00:09:30,249
know, increased the roster and gave it a better
storyline, adapting the Civil War plot from

102
00:09:30,289 --> 00:09:35,432
the comics. Fantastic answer. I remember getting
a PlayStation just to play this game and it

103
00:09:35,452 --> 00:09:42,256
was so much fun. I remember playing X-Men Legends,
which is one of the first action RPG superhero

104
00:09:42,296 --> 00:09:48,099
games of that kind to come out. And I remember
just thinking that I wish that they could expand

105
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:54,302
this gameplay from just the X-Men to the larger
Marvel universe as a whole. And they did exactly

106
00:09:54,322 --> 00:09:59,585
that. And yeah, to this day, Marvel Ultimate
Alliance remains one of the best Marvel video

107
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:04,755
games ever. Yeah, I remember we got that PlayStation
so that I could also play Justice League Heroes,

108
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:09,457
which is like the DC version of the Ultimate
Alliance games. Yeah, that game was like a

109
00:10:09,537 --> 00:10:13,859
lesser version of Ultimate Alliance. Justice
League Heroes didn't get that much fanfare,

110
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:18,441
if I remember correctly. Yeah, that's because
there's so much DC bias out there in the world.

111
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:23,704
So much DC prejudice. Yeah, people are totally
prejudiced against things that suck, for sure.

112
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:24,624
Fuck you.

113
00:10:27,826 --> 00:10:32,169
If anyone still has a PlayStation 2, definitely
pick up Justice League Heroes. It's a good

114
00:10:32,189 --> 00:10:37,133
game. It's good. But great answer, Ed Jones.
You win this week's No Prize. If you, the listener,

115
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:41,277
want a shot at winning your own No Prize, stay
tuned to later on in this episode, when we'll

116
00:10:41,297 --> 00:10:46,321
be asking another question of the week. And
now that that's done, onto the news.

117
00:10:51,854 --> 00:10:57,955
Okay, so this past week we've learned that the
Batman sequel, just tentatively titled The

118
00:10:57,975 --> 00:11:07,138
Batman 2 for now, was pushed back a whole year
from October 25 to October 2nd of 2026. Now

119
00:11:07,158 --> 00:11:13,260
the original film came out two years ago in
2022, so there will be a four-year gap between

120
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:17,681
the two films. Which isn't terrible, like I
remember when we used to have to wait a lot

121
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:23,052
longer for sequels. But too long for me because
I really liked the first movie. Yeah, it's

122
00:11:23,072 --> 00:11:27,875
like a news for DC fans that enjoyed the first
The Batman movie. I hate calling it that, by

123
00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:34,460
the way. But I mean, at least they'll have shows
like The Penguin in the interim, which is supposed

124
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:39,043
to come out later on this year. Yeah, we don't
actually have a solid release date for The

125
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:43,606
Penguin show yet. Hopefully it comes out this
year. Odds are it will, because they've been

126
00:11:43,646 --> 00:11:49,566
filming it for quite some time. And it'll be
a nice holdover until we get. Batman sequel.

127
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:55,530
And honestly, if that show is not good, I feel
like that's going to like really hamper expectations

128
00:11:55,650 --> 00:12:01,814
for the Batman sequel, which would not be great.
Now, a lot of people are saying that this is

129
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:07,198
to give more breathing room for James Gunn's
Superman movie so that they don't release in

130
00:12:07,238 --> 00:12:12,702
the same year. I don't know if I believe that.
I kind of hoped that they were coming out in

131
00:12:12,722 --> 00:12:16,605
the same year, because it would have been really
cool to have both a Superman and Batman film

132
00:12:16,825 --> 00:12:21,615
in 2025. I just think that the script isn't
ready yet and they're not ready to start filming

133
00:12:21,695 --> 00:12:25,998
so they had to push it back. And they want to
keep their October release date because Warner

134
00:12:26,018 --> 00:12:31,001
Brothers has had quite a lot of success for
their films that released in October. Of course

135
00:12:31,081 --> 00:12:36,164
this year in October they're releasing the Joker
sequel, Folly Ado, hoping to recapture the

136
00:12:36,204 --> 00:12:41,467
success of the first Joker film, which also
released in October and made a billion dollars.

137
00:12:42,127 --> 00:12:47,694
By the time the Batman 2 comes out, Robert Panson
will be around... 39 years old, totally old

138
00:12:47,714 --> 00:12:51,935
enough to be a bat dad, which makes you think
that he should just probably have his own kid

139
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:57,117
and Damien Wayne in the Batman franchise and
then, you know, just be the DCU version of

140
00:12:57,157 --> 00:13:02,778
Batman that James Gunn is putting in his franchise.
Well, in the articles that announced the Batman's

141
00:13:02,938 --> 00:13:07,459
pushed release date, they also mentioned that
James Gunn and Peter Safran, the two heads

142
00:13:07,479 --> 00:13:12,861
of DC Studios, mentioned that a separate actor
will be cast for their Batman and Robin film

143
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:18,483
Brave and the Bold, which was announced last
with Andy Muschietti directing. So that's kind

144
00:13:18,503 --> 00:13:23,325
of heartbreaking because I was really hoping
that with Matt Reeves developing an Arkham

145
00:13:23,365 --> 00:13:29,087
series for James Gunn's DCU that meant he was
one step closer to assimilating Robert Pattinson

146
00:13:29,127 --> 00:13:34,289
Batman into James Gunn's universe. But as for
right now, that looks like it's not the case.

147
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:40,992
Yeah, the Batman will stay strictly as an Elseworlds
franchise. So that's stupid, but not as stupid

148
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:48,106
as our next news item. I'm not gonna disagree
with you. This last week we learned that the

149
00:13:48,247 --> 00:13:54,528
Venom sequel, Venom 3, has moved up its release
date from November 8th of this year, 2024,

150
00:13:55,309 --> 00:14:01,450
to October 25th. So a few weeks up. And we learned
that the movie is going to be called Venom

151
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:11,973
The Last Dance. Which is so dumb. Why? So dumb.
Like what the hell does that have to do with

152
00:14:12,073 --> 00:14:17,068
Venom? Like I remember when they released the
title for the second movie in the franchise,

153
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:21,131
which is Venom Let There Be Carnage. And you
and I were complaining because we felt it should

154
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:25,655
have been called Maximum Carnage or Absolute
Carnage or something like that. Like Let There

155
00:14:25,675 --> 00:14:30,058
Be Carnage was just way too cumbersome. The
Last Dance is not cumbersome, but it is really,

156
00:14:30,098 --> 00:14:36,763
really dumb. And my main complaint with the
character of Venom in the Let There Be Carnage

157
00:14:36,803 --> 00:14:43,162
sequel is that the franchise seemed to really...
lean heavily into the goofier side of the Venom

158
00:14:43,182 --> 00:14:49,544
character. And with a title like the last dance
for a character like Venom, who is this freaky,

159
00:14:49,584 --> 00:14:54,405
scary, alien symbiote monster, the Spider-Man
villain, it just seems like a joke, right?

160
00:14:54,465 --> 00:14:59,587
They're like, they're making the character a
joke. Once again, I don't have high hopes for

161
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:04,488
the movie. Well, I'm kind of surprised by that,
honestly, considering that the humorous aspect

162
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:09,846
of Venom, you said was one that you really liked
about the character and the first movie. Well,

163
00:15:09,886 --> 00:15:15,772
yeah, I like this version of having a character
that looks like venom occasionally cracking

164
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:22,758
jokes in moderation. You know, when he's going
to fucking raves and watching soap operas and

165
00:15:22,778 --> 00:15:27,383
raising chickens and stuff, it gets to be a
little bit cartoonish. Famously, The Last Dance

166
00:15:27,423 --> 00:15:33,129
is also known as the title of a Michael Jordan
documentary. So I wonder if there's any kind

167
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:38,832
of tie in there. I think it's more accurately
referencing the Donna Summer song, Last Dance.

168
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:44,455
But also, back in November, Tom Hardy did put
out an Instagram post when they started filming

169
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:50,798
Venom 3 that had the caption of, The Last Dance.
Thankfully, we're back to shooting. So I don't

170
00:15:50,818 --> 00:15:57,262
know if the marketing team decided to name the
movie after Tom Hardy's Instagram caption or

171
00:15:57,822 --> 00:16:01,885
if Tom Hardy was just giving people a peek into
what the title of the movie would be back in

172
00:16:01,925 --> 00:16:08,727
November. Either way. It sucks. It really makes
you wonder what the hell is Sony doing? Like,

173
00:16:08,747 --> 00:16:13,448
are they trying to fail? They're trying to piss
me off is what I think they're trying to do.

174
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:18,150
Everyone, everyone is trying to piss everyone
off. No one likes this. Yeah. What are they

175
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:24,472
doing? It's so crazy that Madame Web came out
about a month ago, and I already own it on

176
00:16:24,512 --> 00:16:30,274
home video. You know, yes, I bought it, but
that's because I buy every Marvel movie. But

177
00:16:30,334 --> 00:16:34,936
yeah, like the movie did so bad at the box office.
I feel like Craven is also not gonna do great

178
00:16:35,016 --> 00:16:40,218
and I also think that Venom 3 is not gonna do
great. And of course, all three of these films

179
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:45,400
are releasing this year. That's insane. Yeah,
what the hell is Sony doing? Because Craven

180
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,702
the Hunter comes out August 30th and then yeah,
just a few months later, you have Venom the

181
00:16:50,722 --> 00:16:56,245
Last Dance, which actually comes out just a
few weeks after Joker Follyadoo. Yeah, that

182
00:16:56,285 --> 00:17:00,667
was the part that kind of pissed me off actually.
It's... Like Sony's trying to bite into Joker's

183
00:17:01,007 --> 00:17:05,291
box office with another comic book movie. But
it's not going to work, Sony. It's the fucking

184
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:11,776
Joker. No one gives a shit about Venom. Except
remember that the Joker is a musical, and that

185
00:17:11,816 --> 00:17:18,621
just sounds weird, too. People need to get over
that. Joker, the musical, Venom apparently

186
00:17:18,641 --> 00:17:25,138
will have a dance number, I'm guessing. It's
all just weird. If I see Venom dancing. to

187
00:17:25,198 --> 00:17:30,808
Donna Summer's Last Dance, I'm gonna walk out
of the theater. I'll sit through it, but I

188
00:17:30,848 --> 00:17:35,597
will comment on it in our review for sure. But
the news about this subtitle for the Venom

189
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:38,281
3 movie brings us to our question of the week.

190
00:17:42,946 --> 00:17:49,211
What Marvel or DC film do you think had the
best subtitle and why? And I swear to God if

191
00:17:49,251 --> 00:17:53,975
you answer, and the fantabulous emancipation
of one Harley Quinn for the Birds of Prey movie,

192
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:57,758
we are throwing your response into the fire.
I mean I don't know, it's still not as bad

193
00:17:57,778 --> 00:18:04,664
as The Last Dance. I don't know about that.
I do! But guys go ahead and record your answer

198
00:18:22,633 --> 00:18:29,234
Be sure to answer before March 23rd. In our
final bit of news, we learned that a live action

199
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:35,676
Teen Titans movie is in development at DC Studios.
Apparently, it's being written by the same

200
00:18:35,696 --> 00:18:37,977
writer who wrote Supergirl Woman of Tomorrow,

201
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:46,091
not sure about the pronunciation of her last
name, but it's exciting to hear that they really

202
00:18:46,131 --> 00:18:51,272
like her as a writer and are bringing her on
another DC project. I've heard that the Supergirl

203
00:18:51,292 --> 00:18:57,254
Woman of Tomorrow script is fantastic, according
to James Gunn. Of course, he may not be the

204
00:18:57,294 --> 00:19:02,056
most unbiased of sources there, but as the head
of the studio, you gotta imagine that when

205
00:19:02,076 --> 00:19:07,017
a project excites him enough to comment on it
on social media and announce that to the world,

206
00:19:07,357 --> 00:19:11,943
it's gotta be pretty good. I mean, the whole
the studio having faith in the script doesn't

207
00:19:11,963 --> 00:19:17,086
really mean anything, considering the writer
of Birds of Prey, Christina Hodson, wrote multiple

208
00:19:17,126 --> 00:19:22,549
DC movies. Yeah, she also wrote The Flash, which
James Gunn also said was one of the best superhero

209
00:19:22,589 --> 00:19:28,933
movies he had ever seen. So I don't know, maybe
I shouldn't put too much faith in this new

210
00:19:28,973 --> 00:19:35,216
writer. But damn it, I gotta, I gotta, because
both projects sound really cool. I've always

211
00:19:35,276 --> 00:19:40,211
wanted to see a live action Teen Titans movie.
I think the film will do gangbusters because

212
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:45,454
a lot of people like Teen Titans, whether it's
the Teen Titans cartoon or Teen Titans Go.

213
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:50,238
I'm really looking forward to seeing what roster
they come up with here. Maybe they'll even

214
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:54,400
include Jaime Reyes' Blue Beetle. You never
know. I wonder if they're going to include

215
00:19:54,641 --> 00:19:58,223
whoever plays Robin in the Brave and the Bold
movie. Like if Damien's going to be part of

216
00:19:58,243 --> 00:20:02,750
the Titans. You have to imagine that they would.
Considering that Brave and the Bold... is supposed

217
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:06,773
to come out before the Teen Titans movie. So
you're just assuming that Nightwing doesn't

218
00:20:06,953 --> 00:20:11,976
exist and that Damien will be Batman's first
Robin in this universe? No, I'm assuming Nightwing

219
00:20:12,137 --> 00:20:17,761
does exist, but they're not going to start with
his history as the character of Robin. I believe

220
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:22,524
that James Gunn's DC Universe is going to be
one that's fully established. And we're not

221
00:20:22,544 --> 00:20:27,267
going to get too many superhero origins. So
why not just include Nightwing in the Teen

222
00:20:27,307 --> 00:20:31,886
Titans movie as opposed to Damien? I mean, you
could. You absolutely could. You can make this

223
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:37,109
more of like a Titans film with like Donna Troy
and Wally West. I think that would be really

224
00:20:37,149 --> 00:20:40,491
cool too. Actually, I would prefer that because
you have to imagine that they're not going

225
00:20:40,511 --> 00:20:45,914
to do too many sidekick characters, like the
very first iteration of the Teen Titans, because

226
00:20:46,234 --> 00:20:51,397
not all of the mentors that the sidekicks belong
to will have been established on screen by

227
00:20:51,437 --> 00:20:57,260
the time this movie is made, I imagine. So characters
like Raven, Starfire, Cyborg, Beast Boy make

228
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:03,147
more sense to me. For sure. Yeah. but no word
on a director or a release date or anything

229
00:21:03,207 --> 00:21:07,413
else besides the writer yet, but we will keep
you guys informed when we find out.

230
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:19,123
That does it for all the news for this episode.
Now let's move on to the main event where we

231
00:21:19,184 --> 00:21:23,773
review the DC animated film, Justice League
Doomsday.

232
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:44,940
Alright, Justice League Doom is a 2012 animated
direct-to-video feature written by Dwayne McDuffie

233
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:50,583
and featuring a voice cast largely taken from
the popular Justice League animated series.

234
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:58,186
It's an adaptation of a very popular JLA storyline
named Tower of Babel written by Mark Waid and

235
00:21:58,266 --> 00:22:04,649
published in the year 2000. This storyline came
out right around the time I first started collecting

236
00:22:04,689 --> 00:22:11,269
DC Comics. And to this day, it's one of my favorite
JLA storylines ever. If you haven't seen the

237
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:16,292
movie or are not familiar with the Tower of
Babel storyline, here's your spoiler warning

238
00:22:16,592 --> 00:22:22,207
as I'll be going into details of both for this
review. So Tower of Babel was a storyline from

239
00:22:22,227 --> 00:22:27,831
the comics that spun out of a mini-series titled
Silver Age, also written by Mark Waid, also

240
00:22:27,871 --> 00:22:33,675
released in the year 2000, that recounted the
story of an alien named Agamemno that swapped

241
00:22:33,735 --> 00:22:38,738
the minds of DC's heroes and villains during
the Silver Age of comics, allowing the villains

242
00:22:38,778 --> 00:22:44,262
to not only use the heroes powers, but also
learn their secret identities. The villain's

243
00:22:44,302 --> 00:22:49,644
memories were later erased, but that retcon
to Silveridge continuity of the Justice League's

244
00:22:49,684 --> 00:22:57,107
history resulted in Batman being wise or paranoid
enough to devise and record secret fail safes

245
00:22:57,127 --> 00:23:01,769
to defeat each member of the Justice League
of America. In the comics, those plans were

246
00:23:01,809 --> 00:23:06,510
stolen by the villain Ra's al Ghul. who planned
on getting the Justice League out of the way

247
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:12,532
in order to prevent them from foiling his ultimate
plan of stirring worldwide chaos by preventing

248
00:23:12,672 --> 00:23:18,013
anyone from reading, which would allow him to
orchestrate an atomic war between two nations.

249
00:23:18,553 --> 00:23:24,255
Okay. Right off the bat, I see the pros and
cons to having Ra's al Ghul as the villain

250
00:23:24,295 --> 00:23:28,416
compared to the Legion of Doom. One of the pros
of having Ra's al Ghul is that you have his

251
00:23:28,456 --> 00:23:32,637
League of Assassins basically taking down the
Justice League, which seems more impressive

252
00:23:32,897 --> 00:23:36,696
on its own right. But on the other hand, in
this film, what I really like is that you got

253
00:23:36,756 --> 00:23:41,579
really great superhero action because you had
the Justice League heroes individuelly going

254
00:23:41,619 --> 00:23:45,502
up against their greatest villains. Right. And
you can't really ask for better than that,

255
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:52,287
you know? No, I totally agree. I think the Legion
of Doom is much, much more compelling. And

256
00:23:52,387 --> 00:23:57,951
it's one of several ways in which Justice League
Doom improves upon the Tower of Babel storyline,

257
00:23:58,391 --> 00:24:04,975
despite being a condensed version of it. Not
only is Vandal Savage, in my opinion, a better

258
00:24:05,015 --> 00:24:10,417
version of Ra's al Ghul in regards to the whole
immortality angle, but characters like Bane,

259
00:24:10,477 --> 00:24:15,539
Mirror Master, and Star Sapphire are obviously
more interesting than nameless ninjas from

260
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:19,821
the comics. In fact, I'd say the roster of the
Legion of Doom is one of the more interesting

261
00:24:19,861 --> 00:24:26,084
things about this film and how well Dwayne McDuffie
was expertly able to generate genuine conflict

262
00:24:26,224 --> 00:24:31,810
and interest by the very nature of the villains
he chose. Like this wasn't a team of Lex Luthor

263
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:37,412
and Joker and Sinestro like the traditional
Legion of Doom, but villains who could genuinely

264
00:24:37,512 --> 00:24:42,813
damage the heroes on multiple levels with the
help of none other than Batman himself, adding

265
00:24:42,853 --> 00:24:48,535
fuel to the idea that, hey, maybe Batman really
is the most powerful superhero in DC Comics.

266
00:24:48,575 --> 00:24:52,996
And this storyline specifically kind of poses
that question. It definitely did amongst comic

267
00:24:53,016 --> 00:24:58,137
fans in the early 2000s. Yeah, in regards to
the roster of the Legion of Doom here, I was

268
00:24:58,177 --> 00:25:02,444
impressed. going into the show. I guess I was
a little bit disappointed because it seemed

269
00:25:02,484 --> 00:25:07,649
like the roster that you had chosen, even for
our team duel that we did last week, was so

270
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:11,352
much better, you know? Because it had people
like Brainiac and stuff like that. And this

271
00:25:11,392 --> 00:25:16,676
team at first glance seemed less interesting,
but it really wasn't. No. It was a fantastic

272
00:25:16,716 --> 00:25:20,179
roster. And I remember thinking like, oh man,
Jonathan should have gone with some of these

273
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:25,203
guys. Well, some of them haven't actually been
a part of the Legion of Doom in the comics.

274
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:30,467
Really the only one that had been was Cheetah.
But no, I agree with you. Like having Brainiac

275
00:25:30,507 --> 00:25:35,031
on this team would have definitely not made
the film as personal as it was. Like you couldn't

276
00:25:35,071 --> 00:25:40,095
have done the whole scene atop the daily planet
with Brainiac as opposed to Metallo. It seemed

277
00:25:40,115 --> 00:25:45,479
that Rostro was handpicked by Vandal Savage
for their unique ability to pose a specific

278
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,785
lethal threat to the heroes. Exactly. Like if
you're going to go up against Superman, go

279
00:25:51,805 --> 00:25:55,408
with the Kryptonite guy, right? Exactly. As
opposed to, you know, someone like Toyman,

280
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:59,746
you know? And if you're going to go up against
Batman... Use the guy who broke his fucking

281
00:25:59,786 --> 00:26:06,208
back. Right, exactly. Yeah. Common sense. Now,
of course, one of the biggest draws for this

282
00:26:06,248 --> 00:26:11,709
film, as you mentioned, is the action, which
takes up over half of the film. I'd say that

283
00:26:11,729 --> 00:26:17,111
there's more action in this film than story,
which is why I'm sure it's pretty popular among

284
00:26:17,131 --> 00:26:24,033
comic fans. The film currently sits at 100 percent
fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and an 87 percent

285
00:26:24,133 --> 00:26:30,107
audience score, which damn, I mean, in I assume
we're going to give this a fresh rating on

286
00:26:30,147 --> 00:26:33,428
Rotten Tomatoes. You're going to recommend the
movie. So that number is going to stay at 100.

287
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:39,130
Yeah. Yep. Maybe you should give this a rotten
rating just to, you know, mess with the score.

288
00:26:39,511 --> 00:26:45,173
Fuck no. I have integrity, bro, as a Rotten
Tomatoes critic. Now, the action is pretty

289
00:26:45,213 --> 00:26:51,496
good. But I do have to say that the animation
style feels fairly dated to me now. Like after

290
00:26:51,516 --> 00:26:56,134
films like Justice League, Flashpoint Paradox,
which came out the year after this. and the

291
00:26:56,194 --> 00:27:00,876
new Tomorrowverse films, I don't really miss
the Bruce Tim style of animation, which I know

292
00:27:01,357 --> 00:27:06,320
is blasphemy. I will say, though, that while
I didn't think the animation was all that great,

293
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:13,364
the character designs, particularly the villains,
were fantastic. Like Bane's never looked sleeker.

294
00:27:13,644 --> 00:27:19,887
Mattello's never looked cooler. Mirror Master's
translucent body was just awesome. Yeah, that

295
00:27:19,907 --> 00:27:25,483
was cool. Star Sapphire was hot and Vandal Savage
was like regal. It was all fantastic, including

296
00:27:25,523 --> 00:27:31,027
for heroes like Cyborg and Martian Manhunter.
Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, the animation was

297
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:35,890
just a notch above what the Saturday Morning
animated cartoon was. Right. To my knowledge,

298
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:40,314
though, this doesn't play within the same continuity
as the Justice League cartoon, even though

299
00:27:40,454 --> 00:27:44,176
it's the same cast. Yeah, they brought in a
lot of the same voice cast. But you're right.

300
00:27:44,257 --> 00:27:48,820
It's a separate universe here. But speaking
of the heroes, let's talk more about them in

301
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:54,307
our character breakdown. Now, Batman. and Bruce
Wayne, were voiced by Kevin Conroy, the late,

302
00:27:54,487 --> 00:28:00,451
great Kevin Conroy. I'm not sure I could say
anything that we haven't said before or that

303
00:28:00,531 --> 00:28:06,414
everyone else does already know. Kevin Conroy
sounds exactly like Batman should sound. And

304
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:11,276
from the opening scene of Batman disregarding
Superman's advice to wait to take care of the

305
00:28:11,296 --> 00:28:17,040
Royal Flush Gang, you recognize this kind of
contempt that Superman has for his superpowered

306
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:22,479
teammates, as though he feels that they think
he's incapable. This is also evident by banter

307
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:27,482
from The Flash. When Batman says he's right
behind him, Flash scoffs at the notion that

308
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:34,227
Batman could be anywhere else. It's subtleties
like these that show why Batman may have created

309
00:28:34,367 --> 00:28:39,691
plans to destroy the League, and it definitely
shows where Dwayne McDuffie, the writer, stands

310
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:45,274
in the debate over whether what Batman did was
right or wrong. In the comic, there's much

311
00:28:45,354 --> 00:28:51,254
more of a drawn-out emotional debate amongst
the League members, of whether what Batman

312
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:57,035
did, you know, think up ways to defeat them,
was morally right. And Batman doesn't quit

313
00:28:57,075 --> 00:29:03,137
the team in the end, he straight up gets voted
out by his peers. So that's one major deviation

314
00:29:03,277 --> 00:29:08,399
of the source material here. I like that more.
Batman choosing to essentially say, you can't

315
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:13,440
fire me, I quit, helps him keep his badass status
a little bit more in this movie. Probably.

316
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:18,301
But I also think that Batman's a cocky little
asshole who deserves to be put in his place

317
00:29:18,341 --> 00:29:24,127
every once in a while. whether or not he is
correct in his position that the league should

318
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:29,808
have fail safes against each other, he doesn't
have to be such a fucking dick about it. If

319
00:29:29,908 --> 00:29:34,770
I were the Green Lantern or something like that,
as Batman was walking out of the Justice League

320
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:39,251
watch tower, I'd have been like, nobody likes
you, don't let the door hit you on the way

321
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:43,092
out or something. Holy shit! Just to, you know,
like, fuck with him. Cause like nobody said

322
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:46,833
anything, they just let Batman be a badass,
but the dude needs to be brought down a wrong

323
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:50,536
game every once in a while. Well, he wasn't
brought down a rung or put in his place in

324
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:56,240
the comics either. He actually was told to step
out of the room while they voted. And when

325
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:02,245
the deciding vote came, it was a mystery. They
looked outside to let Batman know, and it was

326
00:30:02,285 --> 00:30:06,409
revealed that he already knew how each of them
was going to vote and that Superman was going

327
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:11,633
to be the deciding vote to kick him out. So
he was already gone. Lame. He just knew them

328
00:30:11,693 --> 00:30:20,016
that well. OK, he's Batman. Yeah, yeah, exactly.
Now, in this film, Batman's weakness was deemed

329
00:30:20,136 --> 00:30:25,580
to be his emotional attachment to his parents,
which is apt. It was the same in the comics,

330
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:30,363
though Russell Gould didn't bury Bruce alive
with their corpses. He threatened to bring

331
00:30:30,383 --> 00:30:35,347
them back to life in a Lazarus pit, which was
pretty wild. I actually think what Bane did

332
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:40,571
in this movie was more badass. Really? Yeah,
being buried alive with your parents' corpses,

333
00:30:40,611 --> 00:30:45,674
that's hardcore shit, man. It's very hardcore.
I just don't understand. why he left him alive

334
00:30:45,874 --> 00:30:50,257
or didn't like put a giant boulder over the
coffin so he couldn't like, you know, punch

335
00:30:50,277 --> 00:30:55,781
his way out of it. Yeah, that's true. Moving
on to Superman and Clark Kent, he was voiced

336
00:30:55,841 --> 00:31:01,444
by Tim Daly. I'd argue Tim Daly has a better
voice for Superman than any other actor who's

337
00:31:01,504 --> 00:31:06,427
played or voiced the character. He's that good,
in my opinion. Tim Daly is the quintessential

338
00:31:06,627 --> 00:31:10,966
Superman, in the same way that Kevin Conroy
is the quintessential Batman. The whole cast

339
00:31:11,006 --> 00:31:16,291
here, I think, was about as ideal as you could
possibly get as a fan. Uh, for the most part,

340
00:31:16,551 --> 00:31:21,555
yeah yeah. Now almost each of the Justice Leagueers
get a great character moment in this film,

341
00:31:21,975 --> 00:31:27,820
and I think one of Superman's best character
moments out of any feature film is in Justice

342
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:32,864
League Doom. It's when he's talking to the recently
fired reporter who's threatening to kill himself

343
00:31:32,904 --> 00:31:38,199
atop the Daily Planet building. Some listeners
may know that Joseph and I used to be newspaper

344
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:44,162
reporters for a now-defunct major metropolitan
newspaper, which closed just a few years before

345
00:31:44,182 --> 00:31:49,244
this movie first came out. And I remember this
scene just hitting home when I first saw it

346
00:31:49,284 --> 00:31:56,007
back in 2012. Just feeling the despair at the
notion of journalism dying and Superman's words

347
00:31:56,328 --> 00:32:00,926
about how we can't give up the never-ending
battle to fight for truth and justice. It was

348
00:32:00,966 --> 00:32:05,668
just a great scene that I think was inspired
by a key moment from the All-Star Superman

349
00:32:05,688 --> 00:32:10,991
comic, which is supposed to be one of the inspirations
for James Gunn's Superman movie, so I won't

350
00:32:11,011 --> 00:32:15,534
be surprised if we get a similar scene in the
movie. Where he's talking down someone who's

351
00:32:15,554 --> 00:32:20,637
about to jump off a building? Yeah. Now of course,
the powerful scene in this movie is punctuated

352
00:32:20,697 --> 00:32:26,060
by the reporter revealing himself to be Mattello
and shooting Superman in the chest with a kryptonite

353
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:31,975
bullet. I did not see that coming the first
time I watched this. I was shook. Yeah, how

354
00:32:31,995 --> 00:32:36,377
does Mattello even disguise himself in that
way? Well, he's worn fake skin in the past.

355
00:32:36,397 --> 00:32:42,480
Okay. Yeah. Now in the comics, Superman is actually
exposed to red kryptonite, which causes his

356
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:48,303
skin to become transparent, and he absorbs too
much solar radiation so that his senses overload

357
00:32:48,543 --> 00:32:53,265
and his power becomes uncontrollable. I like
the green kryptonite bullet more, honestly.

358
00:32:53,485 --> 00:32:58,536
Yeah, for sure. It also led to a great point
at the end of the film when Superman entrusts

359
00:32:58,596 --> 00:33:03,280
Batman with that same Kryptonite bullet. Kind
of showing that, hey, we're kicking you out,

360
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:09,104
but, you know, you're still my friend. Moving
on to Wonder Woman, she was voiced by Susan

361
00:33:09,224 --> 00:33:14,748
Eisenberg. Now honestly, I love this entire
voice cast, including Susan Eisenberg, but

362
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:20,072
I also love the more recent interpretations
of Wonder Woman's voice having a European accent.

363
00:33:20,552 --> 00:33:24,631
Back when this movie came out though, I thought
Susan Eisenberg's voice was perfect for the

364
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:28,933
character. Yeah, she was much more all American
back in the day, right? Before Gal Gadot's

365
00:33:28,973 --> 00:33:34,716
take. Right. I agree. I also like the more modern
take on her character, like Santa Cat's voice

366
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:40,019
in the tomorrow verse. Right. Or I'm not sure
the name of the actress, but the character

367
00:33:40,139 --> 00:33:45,682
and DC superhero girls also has an accent, which
I think is just great. Now, Wonder Woman probably

368
00:33:45,722 --> 00:33:50,685
has the least amount of character development
in the film. She doesn't have a secret identity

369
00:33:50,725 --> 00:33:55,499
like the others. so she doesn't get that moment
of having her life being interrupted by these

370
00:33:55,539 --> 00:34:01,262
attacks. That said, the method with which she
was brought down was much better here in the

371
00:34:01,302 --> 00:34:07,585
movie than in the comics, where the nanite simulated
reality she was exposed to made her actual

372
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:13,527
body go comatose, and she battled an anonymous
opponent who was her combative equal. In the

373
00:34:13,567 --> 00:34:19,642
movie, having that combatant be Cheetah and
every other bystander and authority figure

374
00:34:19,722 --> 00:34:26,866
around her resemble cheetah as well, was borderline
horrifying. I mean, imagine just randomly being

375
00:34:26,906 --> 00:34:32,390
taken out by a crazy-eyed Wonder Woman for no
reason. She was at like a park when it happened.

376
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:37,673
She had to have punched a baby in the face.
Had to. I guess, I don't know, it was a little

377
00:34:37,693 --> 00:34:42,035
bit weird. You think that she would have snapped
out of it, like, realizing there couldn't possibly

378
00:34:42,235 --> 00:34:48,395
be this many cheetahs, somebody's fucking with
me. Like- especially when you see cheetah fighting

379
00:34:48,555 --> 00:34:53,598
as cyborg and cyborg is doing things that cheetah
can't do you know wonder woman just seemed

380
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:58,382
dumb i think she was just caught up in the adrenaline
and you know cheetah's come out with weird

381
00:34:58,462 --> 00:35:02,764
new powers before so i don't think it was you
know out of the realm of possibility but she

382
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:08,108
was also saying what are you doing wonder woman
you know and like not fighting back obviously

383
00:35:08,188 --> 00:35:14,232
so like kicking your ass what the hell Wouldn't
Wonder Woman at least be confused by the fact

384
00:35:14,252 --> 00:35:18,995
that some of these cheetah people are running
away from her and you know, not wanting to

385
00:35:19,255 --> 00:35:25,559
engage? Uh, maybe. I just think she was really
confused. Or she's really dumb. How dare you.

386
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:32,943
Shut up. Moving on to The Flash, aka Barry Allen.
He was voiced by Michael Rosenbaum, who also

387
00:35:32,983 --> 00:35:38,655
played Lex Luthor in the Smallville television
series. Now, I've always preferred his voice

388
00:35:38,675 --> 00:35:43,499
for Wally West. He voiced Wally West, the Flash
in the Justice League cartoon because he's

389
00:35:43,539 --> 00:35:48,283
fairly comedic, but he does a decent Barry Allen
as well. Well, it was almost the same exact

390
00:35:48,323 --> 00:35:53,908
voice. It was exactly the same voice and really
the same take on the character to assume sort

391
00:35:54,048 --> 00:35:59,332
of sort of. I would say Barry Allen was a little
bit less joking. The Flash typically is now

392
00:35:59,352 --> 00:36:04,777
when this movie came out. I believe it was the
first time I had seen Barry Allen in the role

393
00:36:04,817 --> 00:36:10,952
of the Flash. for maybe over a decade on screen.
I wasn't used to seeing the Flash as an on

394
00:36:10,992 --> 00:36:17,475
the ground CSI type forensic scientist. So that
was a novel angle for its time. By this point

395
00:36:17,555 --> 00:36:23,197
had Barry Allen come back in the new 52? Yes,
this film came out a year after the new 52.

396
00:36:23,658 --> 00:36:29,780
Okay. Now the plan to defeat the Flash in this
movie was somewhat convoluted, second probably

397
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:35,083
only to help Jordan's plan of defeat. But I
liked it more than what we got in the comics.

398
00:36:35,203 --> 00:36:41,187
You know, there, Flash was shot by a vibra bullet,
which sounds like a sex toy. And that caused

399
00:36:41,207 --> 00:36:47,592
him to have seizures at light speed. In the
movie, Mirror Master's trap results in a speed-like

400
00:36:47,632 --> 00:36:53,696
scenario, the movie speed, where the Flash can't
dip below a certain velocity or else he explodes.

401
00:36:53,896 --> 00:36:58,019
And I thought that was a fantastic concept.
That was really cool. I mean, the way that

402
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:02,898
they got the bomb bolted into his wrist was
a little bit convoluted. But the bomb itself

403
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:07,142
was a fascinating concept. And that really that
was the one that I was the most interested

404
00:37:07,202 --> 00:37:11,406
in during the climaxes of each of the characters.
And you're wondering who's going to survive

405
00:37:11,426 --> 00:37:15,009
and how are they going to survive and all that
stuff. I just remember, like, really wanting

406
00:37:15,029 --> 00:37:21,274
to go back to see what the Flash was doing and
Batman's idea to have him vibrate out of the

407
00:37:21,314 --> 00:37:25,778
bomb and embed it into an iceberg, I thought
was just brilliant. Honestly, it was the perfect

408
00:37:25,798 --> 00:37:29,882
way to get out of it and something I did not
see coming. Yeah, I mean, that's. Part of the

409
00:37:29,902 --> 00:37:35,904
enjoyment of, I would say, a majority of this
film is determining, okay, what is so-and-so's

410
00:37:35,944 --> 00:37:40,966
weakness? And now that they're in this trap,
how are they going to get out of it? It's fun

411
00:37:40,986 --> 00:37:47,029
stuff to watch. It's essentially each hero's
worst nightmare come to life, right? Right.

412
00:37:47,449 --> 00:37:52,591
You're right. And that's the big appeal of this
movie is seeing them overcome the most dire

413
00:37:52,611 --> 00:37:57,913
circumstances they'll probably ever face. Yeah.
It's pretty unique in how personal it is. No

414
00:37:57,953 --> 00:38:02,439
other film. is really like this. Like usually
they all have to band together to face one

415
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:08,963
single threat. But being put up against their
like most personal threats and really effective

416
00:38:09,063 --> 00:38:15,847
threats is pretty novel and pretty cool. Moving
on to Green Lantern aka Held Jordan. He was

417
00:38:15,887 --> 00:38:21,130
voiced by Nathan Fillion who will be playing
a different live action Green Lantern Guy Gardner

418
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:26,493
in the upcoming Superman live action movie.
I'm looking forward to it. The guy's a great

419
00:38:26,593 --> 00:38:31,698
actor. who can expertly pull off the bravado
and strength of Hal Jordan, but also the humor

420
00:38:31,738 --> 00:38:36,822
of Guy Gardner. Now, I remember being somewhat
surprised that this cartoon featured Hal Jordan

421
00:38:36,922 --> 00:38:41,326
as opposed to Jon Stewart, because Jon Stewart,
of course, was the main Green Lantern in the

422
00:38:41,386 --> 00:38:47,452
Justice League cartoon series, which this film
borrowed a lot from. In the comics, Green Lantern

423
00:38:47,632 --> 00:38:54,338
was simply blinded as his weakness, but in the
movie, he was cut down to his very core. by

424
00:38:54,378 --> 00:39:00,659
an elaborate trap set up by Star Sapphire using
Scarecrow's fear toxin. And it made more sense

425
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:05,481
thematically to me for Hal Jordan to succumb
to fear rather than blindness because it's

426
00:39:05,521 --> 00:39:10,902
the primary thing that he's supposed to be able
to overcome to be a Green Lantern. So giving

427
00:39:11,022 --> 00:39:17,924
up that mantle after feeling guilt when a young
woman died was pretty tragic. You really got

428
00:39:17,964 --> 00:39:23,185
the sense that Hal truly was afraid that he
didn't deserve the power that he wielded with

429
00:39:23,225 --> 00:39:29,804
his ring. I will admit that I first thought
Star Sapphire's whole setup was a little weird

430
00:39:30,144 --> 00:39:35,090
until Batman explained the fear toxin angle
and then it all made sense. Yeah, absolutely.

431
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:39,375
I thought that as well. I was like, really?
Like Star Sapphire isn't even going to fight

432
00:39:39,415 --> 00:39:43,279
him. She's just going to like show up out of
fucking nowhere without explanation to be like,

433
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:48,219
wow, you really suck, Hal. And he's just gonna
be like, yeah, I do. And then drop the ring

434
00:39:48,259 --> 00:39:52,561
like that's so much less compelling than like
having a bomb bolted through your wrist like

435
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:56,682
the flash. You know, right. Like I was like,
this is stupid. What are they thinking? But

436
00:39:56,722 --> 00:40:01,244
then when Batman mentioned the fear toxin from
the scarecrow, I was like, oh, OK, this it

437
00:40:01,284 --> 00:40:06,887
does work. And they gave the briefest hints
of what was going on when he saw this truck

438
00:40:06,947 --> 00:40:10,368
coming at him and it turned into a monster.
But then he like blinked and it was a truck

439
00:40:10,388 --> 00:40:15,302
again. Yeah. But you had to really be paying
attention to catch that. I do wish they gave

440
00:40:15,322 --> 00:40:20,963
a little bit more backstory as to the history
between Hal and Carol and why and how Carol

441
00:40:20,983 --> 00:40:25,285
became a Star Sapphire though. I kind of feel
like we have to do a Star Sapphire duel at

442
00:40:25,305 --> 00:40:30,846
some point in the future. Bring it on, for sure.
Moving on to Martian Manhunter aka John Jones,

443
00:40:31,266 --> 00:40:37,108
Carl Lumbee's voice performance is perfect for
Martian Manhunter and he pulls double duty

444
00:40:37,128 --> 00:40:43,109
in this film uncredited as he was also the voice
for Ma'alif'Aq, whom we affectionately refer

445
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:51,334
to as as Motherfucker on our Discord server.
But his supervillain name is Molefic, pronounced

446
00:40:51,594 --> 00:40:57,918
Motherfucker. Now, I love seeing John Jones
in this film. I don't think too many people

447
00:40:58,018 --> 00:41:03,602
are familiar with the Martian Manhunter's alter
ego, since he's usually resigned to like satellite

448
00:41:03,642 --> 00:41:09,305
duty in the Justice League comics and cartoon.
But the guy has a life outside of being a superhero.

449
00:41:09,762 --> 00:41:15,744
The whole dynamic of John's friends wanting
to celebrate with him was a great bit of trickery

450
00:41:15,804 --> 00:41:20,826
because you weren't sure where the trap was
going to come from. Was it his partner or the

451
00:41:20,866 --> 00:41:25,348
co-worker who had a crush on him? Of course
it ended up being some blonde floozy at the

452
00:41:25,388 --> 00:41:31,091
bar and let that be a lesson to everyone. In
the comics, it was nanites that converted his

453
00:41:31,131 --> 00:41:37,253
skin to magnesium, but I think the poison sweat
secretions that set him on fire were a lot

454
00:41:37,333 --> 00:41:43,755
better. Like, motherfucker is one cold mother-
Shut your mouth. What? I'm just talking about

455
00:41:43,815 --> 00:41:44,596
motherfucker? Hahaha.

456
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:54,391
Yeah, it was horrifying. What I want to know
is why didn't Martian Manhunter die? Because

457
00:41:54,451 --> 00:41:59,493
he was literally on fire, screaming his head
off for a solid like 15, 20 minutes. Well,

458
00:41:59,513 --> 00:42:04,794
that's a good question. So traditionally in
the comics, the fire pain that Martians feel

459
00:42:04,834 --> 00:42:10,156
is psychological. It's not physical pain or
physical damage. They are psychically afraid

460
00:42:10,196 --> 00:42:16,602
of fire as a race. It debilitates them, but
it's not going to like burn them. Moving briefly

461
00:42:16,682 --> 00:42:21,304
over to Cyborg, he was voiced by Bumper Robinson.
I think he did just as good a job with the

462
00:42:21,344 --> 00:42:26,827
character as Kerry Payton from Teen Titans Go
personally. This was the cinematic introduction

463
00:42:26,887 --> 00:42:31,549
to Cyborg being on the Justice League, as he
had recently been made a member of the team

464
00:42:31,729 --> 00:42:38,452
in the New 52 reboot of DC Comics. He actually
proves to be a fairly vital member to the team

465
00:42:38,532 --> 00:42:43,610
in this film, probably the most vital in this
adventure. as the Legion of Doom is equipped

466
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:49,392
with some fairly advanced technology. Vandal
Savage mentions that he got the Bat Computer

467
00:42:49,412 --> 00:42:54,733
Decoder from LexCorp, so you have to wonder
where he got his other technology. With Marsha

468
00:42:54,753 --> 00:42:59,154
Manhunter on the team, I was a little bit confused
because Cyborg did feel a little bit out of

469
00:42:59,175 --> 00:43:03,696
place to me, considering that Aquaman was nowhere
to be seen. Yeah, I mean, Aquaman was in the

470
00:43:03,736 --> 00:43:10,390
comic. His weakness was that using a scarecrow
toxin, he was made afraid of water. But once

471
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:16,395
Martian Manhunter got over being on fire, he
was able to psychically help Aquaman stop being

472
00:43:16,435 --> 00:43:21,960
afraid. The one villain I want to touch on in
our character breakdown is Vandal Savage. He

473
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,366
was voiced by Phil Morris, who does a ton of
DC work. He played Martian Manhunter in Smallville,

474
00:43:28,766 --> 00:43:34,531
and he was Dr. Silas Stone in the Doom Patrol
series. Now Vandal Savage in this film made

475
00:43:34,571 --> 00:43:41,292
it his goal to cut Earth's population in half.
making him essentially like Thanos before Thanos,

476
00:43:41,613 --> 00:43:46,717
clearly showing once again how much Marvel rips
off from DC. I'm sorry, but the Infinity Gauntlet

477
00:43:46,737 --> 00:43:52,101
storyline came out way before this movie. Oh
yeah. Anyway, to do this, of course, Vandal

478
00:43:52,241 --> 00:43:57,705
was going to use a missile to generate a massive
solar flare that would scorch the sunward side

479
00:43:57,725 --> 00:44:03,289
of the planet, though I'm not sure where you'd
have to hit to destroy exactly 50% of the population.

480
00:44:03,754 --> 00:44:08,856
It was a pretty unique plan, I think, as was
the League's method of stopping it. I want

481
00:44:08,876 --> 00:44:14,478
to know why Vandal Savage even needed the Legion
of Doom to pull off this Solar Flare mission.

482
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:19,741
If he didn't fuck with the League, chances are
that they probably wouldn't even been on to

483
00:44:19,781 --> 00:44:25,103
him and his plan. He probably would have pulled
it off, considering how hard it was for the

484
00:44:25,143 --> 00:44:29,565
League to actually stop his plan when they knew
well in advance when it was going to happen.

485
00:44:29,985 --> 00:44:34,576
What if he just... you know, shot the missile
and, you know, no one was the wiser until half

486
00:44:34,596 --> 00:44:39,059
the planet was gone. That seems like it would
make more sense. Interesting. I think maybe

487
00:44:39,079 --> 00:44:43,863
he just didn't want to take the chance. Like
the missile would have shown up in like Watchtower

488
00:44:44,063 --> 00:44:48,326
space radar. I'm pretty sure. And then what
would they have done? Exactly what they already

489
00:44:48,366 --> 00:44:51,988
did. Superman would have gone up and he would
have tried to stop the missile, but it would

490
00:44:52,008 --> 00:44:55,487
have, you know, ejected more missiles. And the
only thing that would have been different is

491
00:44:55,527 --> 00:45:00,591
that Cyborg wouldn't have had access to the
technology that made Earth intangible for the

492
00:45:00,611 --> 00:45:04,614
flare to pass through. Well, I mean, you know,
Green Lantern could have also gone with Superman

493
00:45:04,634 --> 00:45:08,618
instead of being distracted by Star Sapphire,
though, you know, Superman could have had more

494
00:45:08,638 --> 00:45:13,502
help. He had help with Green Lantern. All Green
Lantern could do was create a shield that was

495
00:45:13,582 --> 00:45:19,286
strong enough. No, I mean, at the Sun, though.
I'm not buying it. Bitch, just accept it. It's

496
00:45:19,347 --> 00:45:26,539
a story. Why are you getting mad? I don't know.
Just admit that Vandal Savage is stupid. Um,

497
00:45:27,139 --> 00:45:34,042
okay. Yeah, sure. All right. Now it's never
explained how Vandal Savage knew that Batman

498
00:45:34,062 --> 00:45:38,844
had plans to bring down members of the Justice
League, but that's kind of the mystery of Vandal

499
00:45:38,864 --> 00:45:44,626
Savage. Like he's been around so long. He just
knows things. His access to information and

500
00:45:44,686 --> 00:45:49,828
resources are essentially his superpower, along
with his immortality and brutish strength.

501
00:45:49,968 --> 00:45:54,142
He's another character they'll have to do a
duel with someday. Yeah, our executive producer

502
00:45:54,162 --> 00:45:58,204
said we should put him against Sebastian Shaw,
but I'm pretty sure Shaw would beat the shit

503
00:45:58,224 --> 00:46:03,567
out of Vandal Savage. You don't know. I mean,
Vandal Savage can't die, but he also can't

504
00:46:03,667 --> 00:46:10,351
get superhumanly strong. So we use already superhumanly
strong kids like a gorilla type strength. That's

505
00:46:10,371 --> 00:46:14,453
not going to be good enough. OK, let's go ahead
and move into our story highlights.

506

where we settle the debate and settle the score.

513
00:47:09,058 --> 00:47:14,680
Batman finds the Royal Flush Gang using advanced
technology to steal diamonds. He summons the

514
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:20,222
aid of the Justice League to Gotham City to
bring them down. The hero Cyborg aids the team

515
00:47:20,302 --> 00:47:25,584
in defeating the gang and in analyzing the device
that allowed the villainous team to enter the

516
00:47:25,624 --> 00:47:31,387
diamond storage facility by turning walls intangible.
With the Royal Flush Gang unable to remember

517
00:47:31,447 --> 00:47:36,449
who gave them the device, the Justice League
goes their separate ways for the night. As

518
00:47:36,489 --> 00:47:42,284
Batman returns home in the Batmobile, He glimpses
Mirror Master in his rearview mirror, but dismisses

519
00:47:42,324 --> 00:47:49,069
the sighting. I do have one question here. Uh,
why does the Batmobile have a rearview mirror

520
00:47:49,229 --> 00:47:54,733
with no rear window? That's a great question.
Yeah, you assume he has like a rear camera

521
00:47:54,833 --> 00:48:02,259
as opposed to a rear window. Plot hole for sure.
Ruins the whole movie! One star. The fight

522
00:48:02,299 --> 00:48:07,122
against the Royal Flush Gang was a great way
to kick off this movie. because it was just

523
00:48:07,142 --> 00:48:11,746
a lot of fun, a great way to show off the characters
superpowers and whatnot. And the Royal Flush

524
00:48:11,786 --> 00:48:16,890
Gang, actually I always thought that they made
their debut in the Batman Beyond television

525
00:48:16,930 --> 00:48:22,895
series. So to see them here, I was actually
surprised. Oh really? No, they've been around

526
00:48:22,935 --> 00:48:27,319
a while. I think they were even in an episode
of Justice League, but yeah, they've been around

527
00:48:27,339 --> 00:48:32,970
a while. They're just a cool gimmicky set of
supervillains. Very gimmicky, although I liked

528
00:48:32,990 --> 00:48:37,652
that in this version each one had their own
specific gimmick, whether an eye laser, or

529
00:48:37,692 --> 00:48:42,453
like razor sharp cards, or brute strength. I
think that was pretty unique. After Batman

530
00:48:42,493 --> 00:48:47,615
parks the Batmobile and leaves the Batcave to
tend to his wounds, a hologram of Mirror Master

531
00:48:47,695 --> 00:48:52,856
leaves the Batmobile and hacks the Batcomputer,
stealing files that contain Batman's contingency

532
00:48:52,876 --> 00:48:58,855
plans on how to incapacitate each member of
the Justice League. When Bane, Metallo, Cheetah,

533
00:48:59,035 --> 00:49:04,658
Star Sapphire, and Mothafucka answer an invitation
to the Legion of Doom headquarters in the Louisiana

534
00:49:04,698 --> 00:49:10,582
Swamp, they meet the Legion's leader, Vandal
Savage, an immortal who offers each of them

535
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:15,965
generous rewards if they use his stolen plans
to bring down the Justice League. The Legion

536
00:49:15,985 --> 00:49:20,708
of Doom headquarters was a nice homage to the
Super Friends cartoon. Right. Yeah. Not only

537
00:49:20,728 --> 00:49:25,482
was it in the swamp, not only did it look- Kind
of like Darth Vader's head, but even the sitting

538
00:49:25,502 --> 00:49:31,224
chamber was reminiscent of the Super Friends.
At Wayne Manor, Bane ambushes Batman at the

539
00:49:31,264 --> 00:49:36,145
graves of his parents, Thomas and Martha Wayne,
beating him unconscious and burying him alive

540
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:42,307
in his father's coffin. At a bar near the coast,
Motherfucker, disguised as an attractive woman,

541
00:49:42,667 --> 00:49:48,729
tricks police detective John Jones, aka Martian
Manhunter, into drinking a poison that causes

542
00:49:48,749 --> 00:49:54,606
him to sweat flammable magnesium and burst into
flames. While battling Wonder Woman on a docked

543
00:49:54,666 --> 00:50:00,248
ship, Cheetah scratches Wonder Woman with nanite-tipped
claws, resulting in Wonder Woman seeing and

544
00:50:00,308 --> 00:50:06,589
hearing Cheetah in innocent bystanders. Mirror
Master lures Flash into a trap, attaching a

545
00:50:06,669 --> 00:50:11,991
bomb to his wrist that will create a 3-mile
explosion if he tries to remove it or decrease

546
00:50:12,071 --> 00:50:17,992
in speed. Star Sapphire targets Green Lantern
in a mine, using fear gas on him and convincing

547
00:50:18,032 --> 00:50:23,062
him that he doesn't deserve his mantle, leading
him to renounce his reign. and resigned himself

548
00:50:23,082 --> 00:50:28,805
to his fate in the collapsing salt mine. Metallo,
disguised as a recently terminated Daily Planet

549
00:50:28,845 --> 00:50:33,888
reporter, shoots Superman with a kryptonite
bullet on the Daily Planet roof. I just want

550
00:50:33,908 --> 00:50:39,291
to say that Marsha Manhunter has no Riz. And
I don't know if I'm too old to say Riz, so

551
00:50:39,311 --> 00:50:44,514
I'll switch it up to game. Like, this woman
bought him a soda and he just comes up to her

552
00:50:44,554 --> 00:50:50,390
and he's like, mmm delicious soda. I just remember
thinking like, this is so awkward. Like he's

553
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:55,733
an alien, so you kind of give him a pass. Yeah.
But I just thought it was hilarious. Yeah.

554
00:50:55,793 --> 00:51:00,897
If that really wasn't motherfucker, she would
have just been like, uh, I got to go wash my

555
00:51:00,957 --> 00:51:09,723
hair. I have a sick aunt. Out of all the different
ways this story rift on the characters weaknesses

556
00:51:09,863 --> 00:51:14,126
from the source material, what was your favorite?
Well, my favorite was Superman. That was my

557
00:51:14,166 --> 00:51:18,889
favorite moment, maybe in the entire movie.
I think it was shocking. I think it was heartfelt.

558
00:51:19,422 --> 00:51:24,425
I loved what Superman was saying. I think it
was just like a great closure to like the whole

559
00:51:24,505 --> 00:51:28,748
sequence of all the heroes going down. Actually,
when Superman hits the ground, that's the end

560
00:51:28,788 --> 00:51:32,610
of that whole sequence. And that's actually
the halfway point of the movie. Interesting.

561
00:51:33,011 --> 00:51:37,434
So, yeah, it takes a while to get through all
of it. What about yours? Again, The Flash,

562
00:51:37,674 --> 00:51:41,517
I think. And my least favorite, of course, was
Green Lanterns until I knew what happened there.

563
00:51:41,817 --> 00:51:45,019
They're all pretty great, honestly. I don't
know if I have a least favorite. I liked them

564
00:51:45,079 --> 00:51:51,043
all. Well, Cyborg helps Wonder Woman overcome
her hallucination. By recognizing and neutralizing

565
00:51:51,103 --> 00:51:56,226
the frequency the nanites were emitting, Batman
helps Flash by suggesting he phase through

566
00:51:56,246 --> 00:52:01,729
an arctic iceberg to cool and slow down the
electronics in the wrist-mounted bomb. Wonder

567
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:07,012
Roman then helps Martian Manhunter, still on
fire in the water, by injecting his body with

568
00:52:07,052 --> 00:52:12,655
aluminum oxide at Batman's suggestion, while
Batman himself visits Green Lantern in the

569
00:52:12,755 --> 00:52:19,679
salt mine to reveal that Green Lantern was deceived
by a mixture of fear toxin, animatronics. Batman,

570
00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:25,203
Cyborg, and Martian Manhunter together are able
to save Superman by removing the kryptonite

571
00:52:25,243 --> 00:52:30,766
bullet in his chest. You know for as much shit
as the league gives Batman at least the guy

572
00:52:30,907 --> 00:52:37,591
also had fail safes for his fail safes. You
know, he did develop ways to take each of the

573
00:52:37,631 --> 00:52:42,754
league members out but he also had ways to stop
those plans. Exactly with like the aluminum

574
00:52:42,855 --> 00:52:48,830
oxide with the kryptonite scalpel. Yeah, there
were plans in place. Like, he put them in danger,

575
00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:53,954
but he also saved their lives. Exactly. Now,
at the Justice League satellite headquarters,

576
00:52:54,255 --> 00:52:59,298
Batman reveals that what the team had just gone
through was his fault. That Mirror Master,

577
00:52:59,619 --> 00:53:04,222
while working with someone else, had stolen
his plans to neutralize the League members.

578
00:53:04,663 --> 00:53:10,147
Despite being angry with him, the League tracks
a signal from Batman's decoded files to the

579
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:15,159
Legion of Doom headquarters, where the League
battles the Legion. but are unable to stop

580
00:53:15,219 --> 00:53:19,663
Vandal Savage from launching his missile to
the sun. What did you think of Vandal Savage's

581
00:53:19,723 --> 00:53:25,348
motivation? As far as humanity needed to, I
don't know, become simpler or something through

582
00:53:25,428 --> 00:53:30,793
chaos and destruction? I think it makes sense
for the character. He comes from a much simpler

583
00:53:30,853 --> 00:53:39,220
time, and with his immortality, he probably
does feel like he is the best equipped to govern

584
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:44,699
humanity as a species. You know, definitely
better than Russell Gould's motivation of simply

585
00:53:44,799 --> 00:53:49,900
distracting everyone. Made it so that no one
could read, so that it caused global chaos

586
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:56,662
with the ultimate goal of initiating a war between
two countries. So that lack of communication

587
00:53:56,922 --> 00:54:01,883
is why that arc was called Tower of Babel. Yes.
Yep. Makes sense. He created this tower that

588
00:54:01,923 --> 00:54:08,325
emitted a frequency worldwide that scrambled
the reading centers in people's brains. I don't

589
00:54:08,365 --> 00:54:14,208
know. Well now it makes more sense why the name
of this movie wasn't Justice League Tower of

590
00:54:14,248 --> 00:54:19,551
Babel and I do think that Justice League Doom
is a much better name. I agree, much better

591
00:54:19,591 --> 00:54:24,735
promise all around. After overcoming their counterparts,
the Justice League works together to save the

592
00:54:24,775 --> 00:54:31,034
planet when Superman fails to stop the missile
from triggering a solar flare. Cyborg discovers

593
00:54:31,054 --> 00:54:35,697
that the Legion headquarters is like a giant
version of the Royal Flush Gang's intangibility

594
00:54:35,757 --> 00:54:44,382
device and calculates that they could use it
to turn the entire planet intangible and safe

595
00:54:44,402 --> 00:54:49,966
from the harm of the solar flare. The plan works
and the Earth is saved. Isn't that kind of

596
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:59,007
bullshit? It's a comic book, bro! I thought
it was cool. You know, turning the planet intangible

597
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:04,229
wouldn't necessarily save it from all the effects
of the solar flare, right? Sure would. What

598
00:55:04,269 --> 00:55:09,252
are you talking about? Why wouldn't it, Dr.
Joseph? And also, like, what would happen to

599
00:55:09,312 --> 00:55:13,014
everybody on the planet if the Earth became
intangible? Like, wouldn't they fall into it?

600
00:55:13,454 --> 00:55:17,756
It was all just weird. It was all weird. No,
because the planet wouldn't have had gravity

601
00:55:17,836 --> 00:55:22,038
anymore because it had no more mass. Because
it was intangible. Stupid. I thought that was

602
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:26,502
the most bullshit way to avoid a solar flare
that they could have come up with in a fantasy

603
00:55:26,562 --> 00:55:32,067
comic book story. I thought it was actually
a really interesting and fun way to do it It

604
00:55:32,107 --> 00:55:36,791
was like one of those things from the Justice
League comic books in the 90s and early 2000s

605
00:55:37,412 --> 00:55:42,016
Just these like wacky ways of stopping this
global threat that's gonna annihilate the world.

606
00:55:42,316 --> 00:55:47,351
It's just unbelievably over the top If it were
me, like, I would have written it so that Cyborg

607
00:55:47,371 --> 00:55:54,294
interfaces with the JLA watch tower and generates
a reverse magnetic polarity beam that, you

608
00:55:54,314 --> 00:55:59,096
know, deflects the solar flare or something
like that. That seems way more plausible, at

609
00:55:59,136 --> 00:56:03,597
least in my mind, than turning the entire damn
planet intangible and having a solar flare

610
00:56:03,637 --> 00:56:10,180
pass through it. Dude, your idea is like some
dumb shit that Marvel would do. DC is way cooler.

611
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,706
Okay. Like, are we gonna stop a solar flare?
Yeah. We're going to turn the whole fucking

612
00:56:14,766 --> 00:56:20,550
planet intangible. It's going to be dope. That
doesn't make sense to your small mind. It doesn't.

613
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:27,154
But to us, big brain DC guys, it makes perfect
sense. Stop lying to yourself. What you're

614
00:56:27,174 --> 00:56:31,037
saying all of this with like the big smile on
your face. You know, it's bullshit. You just

615
00:56:31,057 --> 00:56:36,300
don't want to say it's bullshit. It's a comic
book, bro. Now, back at the league satellite

616
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:41,123
headquarters, the team learns that Vandal Savage.
was found guilty of crimes against humanity

617
00:56:41,323 --> 00:56:47,528
and sentenced to life without parole. They officially
add Cyborg to their roster and vote on Batman's

618
00:56:47,548 --> 00:56:53,272
continued membership with the team. Though Batman
defends his actions, he ultimately quits the

619
00:56:53,312 --> 00:56:58,396
League. Superman teleports Batman out of the
Watchtower after giving him a box with the

620
00:56:58,416 --> 00:57:03,799
Kryptonite bullet inside, recognizing the need
for contingencies against them and showing

621
00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:08,918
his trust in Batman. And that's the end of the
film. Are you a little bit surprised that this

622
00:57:08,978 --> 00:57:14,861
movie wasn't considered continuity for the DC
animated movie universe that followed this?

623
00:57:15,041 --> 00:57:20,263
I believe Justice League War came out not too
long after this movie, and that also had Cyborg

624
00:57:20,343 --> 00:57:25,065
on the team. It seems like they could have rolled
with this into that universe. Well, the only

625
00:57:25,125 --> 00:57:30,387
problem with that is that between these two
films was the Flashpoint Paradox, which reset

626
00:57:30,467 --> 00:57:35,189
everything. Justice League War is a direct sequel
to the Flashpoint Paradox. They're in the same

627
00:57:35,269 --> 00:57:42,445
universe. So because you had that movie reset
things you couldn't still have doom in continuity.

628
00:57:42,885 --> 00:57:47,488
Yeah, I guess that makes sense. I really like
this film. I think it's a short yet adequate

629
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:53,191
adaptation of the Tower of Babel comic storyline,
complete with a fan favorite voice cast and

630
00:57:53,311 --> 00:57:59,535
enjoyable superhero action. I love the rosters
for both the good guys and the bad guys especially.

631
00:57:59,735 --> 00:58:06,566
I'm giving this film, four stars, a fresh rating
on Rotten Tomatoes. Yeah, I agree. I mean,

632
00:58:06,687 --> 00:58:10,810
it has almost everything you would want in a
Justice League film. The superpowers are on

633
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:15,955
full display. The action is great. The voice
casting is great. Animation is serviceable

634
00:58:16,475 --> 00:58:20,899
and the story is extremely fascinating. Also
extremely simple and extremely short. The movie

635
00:58:20,979 --> 00:58:26,604
isn't even an hour and a half long. It's only
77 minutes. Most movies are around 90 minutes,

636
00:58:26,964 --> 00:58:31,468
so they definitely had enough room to delve
into the characters a little bit more, and

637
00:58:31,488 --> 00:58:37,424
they probably should have. But yeah, it's definitely
one I would recommend to anyone familiar with

638
00:58:37,504 --> 00:58:42,307
DC. But that does it for this review. Let us
know what you thought about the movie by writing

it's going to be a duel. We're going to find

646
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:25,685
out who will win in a fight between Ultra Humanite
and Mr. Sinister. This duel is a long time

647
00:59:25,725 --> 00:59:31,196
coming. Mr. Sinister is by far one of the biggest
villains that Marvel has that we have yet to

648
00:59:31,216 --> 00:59:36,458
get in a duel. So I'm really excited for this
one. As am I. Ultra Humanite was Superman's

649
00:59:36,518 --> 00:59:41,000
first supervillain and it's about time we've
done a duel episode with him. But that does

650
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:45,558
it for this episode. We want to give a big thanks
to our executive producers. Kent Johnson, John

the cursed. Recapture.
